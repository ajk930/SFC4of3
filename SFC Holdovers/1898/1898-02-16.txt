One of the Most Awful Disasters
That Have Ever Overtaken the
American Navy, and Spain
is Open to Suspicion,
HAVANA, Feb. 15.â The Maine
has blown up. Captain Sigsbee and
various officers saved, and he pays
he believes about 100 men were
killed and injured. The vessel is
now burning and is sinking to the
bottom of the bay. The detonation
was tremendous. All Havana
alarmed.
HAVANA. Feb. 15. â The American
battleship Maine, lying at anchor here,
was destroyed by an explosion at 10
o'clock to-night. Of her crew of 450
officers and men, only 33 are known to
have been saved.
The explosion shook the whole city
and threw Havana into a panic.
It is understood at this writing that |
Captain Sigsbee and a few of his offi
cers were visiting a merchantman in
the harbor at the time of the disaster
and are sdie.
None of the few survivors who have
been seen can tell me how the ex
plosion occurred. The injured are be
ing taken on stretchers to the Casa de
Socorro, where surgeons are in at
tendance.
James Rowe, the ship's cook, was the
least injured of any that were brought
in when I was there.
"I don't know, sir," he replied,
speaking with difficulty. " I turned in
my hammock at 8 o'clock and heard
three bells strike. I don't remember
anything until I felt myself turning
over and over and falling heavily upon
the deck, in a mass of smoke. I got on
foot and worked my way on deck.
When I got. there the superstructure of
CHARLES D. SIGSBEE, COMMANDER OF THE MAINE.
Captain Charles D. Sigsbee, In command of the warship Maine, sent
by the Navy Department to guard American interests in Havana, is one
of the most popular officers in the navy. He was graduated from Annapo
lis in 1863. He served in Mobile Bay, was an active participant in the work
of the North Atlantic blockading squadron in 1865, and helped in the at
tacks and in the final assault upon Fort Fisher.
Not long ago the Maine, with Sipsbee in command, found herself
bearing down on an excursion boat in the East River. Ahead wa.i the
excursion boat, full of human beings. On either side was a barge. The
only clear way showed a pier. Th<* old commander ordered his engines
reversed, and to the amazement of the beholders he steered straight
for the pier and ran into it amuck. The pier was badly torn up, the
Maine's nose was bruised, but several hundred human lives were
saved. The excursion boat ran clear, but ten loaded freight cars, that
were standing on the pier, went to the bottom of the river. There is
no doubt as to Captain Sigsbee's relative valuation of human life and
property. About $4000 in property was destroyed, but 1000 lives were
saved. That was not a bad ten minutes' work for a man whose busi
ness it is to kill.
Captain Sigsbee went to Cuba on board of a fine, stout ship,
manned by a complement of able officers.

the deck was dipping under water, and
I jumped overboard to keep from be
ing drawn down by the suction.
"I was picked up by a boat from the
Spanish man-of-war. Three more were
picked up by the same boat. They were
Daniel Cronin, a landsman; Charles
Berryman, boatswain; Albert John, a
seaman, and â Bloomer, a landsman."
One poor fellow whose face is in
jured past all recognition is lying
moaning in a cot in the hospital. I
asked him his name and he mumbled
back through horribly swollen lips:
"My folks would feel uneasy if I told
you."
So far as I can learn now the ex
plosion took place in the magazine
used for the storage of gun cotton for
the torpedoes. The vessel lies with her
bow wholly submerged and only a part
of her stern showing.
The explosion shook the city from
end to end, and created the wildest ex
citement. All the electric lights were
blown out by the shock. Fire engines
rushed madly from one district to an
other, and no one knew for certain
from which point the explosion
came:
Some shouted the report that it was
SAX FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1898.
The Maine was commanded by Captain Charles D.
Sigsbee.
Her other officers were:
Lieutenant-Commander Richard Wainwright.
Lieutenants G. F. Holman, John Hood and C. W. Yungen.
Lieutenants (junior grade) C. W. Blow, J. T. Blandin, F.

the arsenal, others said it was a bomb,
and it was not until n o'clock that the
real cause was known.
Consul-General Lee, who was at the
Hotel Ingleterra, received a telephone
message from General Blanco telling
him that the Maine had been blown up.
Lee hastened to the palace, where
the Cabinet is now assembled.
Admiral Manterola ordered that
boats of all kinds go to the assistance
of the Maine and her wounded. The
Havana firemen also gave aid, tending
carefully to the wounded as they were
brought on shore. It was a terrible
sight. General Zolano and the other
generals were ordered by Captain-
General Blanco to take steps to help
the Maine's crew in every way possible.
The correspondent went close to the
Maine in one of the boats of the cruiser
Alfonso XII, and saw others of the
wounded who corroborate the state
ment of those first interviewed that
they were asleep when the explosion
occurred.
Captain Sigsbee said the explosion
occurred in the bow of the vessel. He
received a wound in the head. Orders
were given to the other officers to save
themselves as best they could. The lat
ter, who were literally thrown from
their bunks in their night clothing,
gave the necessary orders with great
self-control.
The first theory was that there had
been a preliminary explosion of powder
or dynamite below the water, but this
was ascertained to be not true.
Admiral Manterola believes that the
first explosion was of a grenade, but
whether one of the ship's magazines
blew up or whether a bomb was placed
beside her and set off by the Spaniards
is not known.
Because of the excitement in the city
the military authorities ordered the
troops to quarters, and the streets are
filled with jostling crowds of excited
citizens and soldiers.
SIGSBEE ASKS FOR
SUSPENSION OF JUDGMENT.
Wants to Know All the Tacts Before
the American People Lay the
Blame Finally Upon Spain.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â I called
upon Secretary of the Navy John T.
Long at an early hour this morning,
and he confirmed the Herald's dispatch
that the Maine had been blown up and
destroyed in Havana harbor. In an
swer to my questions, he said:
"Yes, I have received a report from
Captain Sigsbee of the Maine, announc
ing that the battleship had been de
stroyed by an explosion in the harbor
of Havana.
The captain cables that some were
killed and many wounded, and that the
Spanish soldiers did everything In their
power to rescue those who were thrown
Into the water.
"Moreover the captain's dispatch
speaks of the great kindness of the
officers and citizens of Havana, who
showered attentions upon the sufferers.
They cared tenderly for the wounded.
The captain, in his dispatch to me, also
tells of the heroic work of the officers
and men of the cruiser Alfonso."
"Mr. Secretary," I asked, "does Cap
tain Sigsbee assign any cause of the
explosion?"
"No," replied the Secretary; "I pre
sume that as yet the cause is a mys
tery."
The following was the dispatch re
ceived by the Secretary of the Navy
from Captain Sigsbee:
"Maine blown up in Havana har
bor at 9:40 last night and destroyed.
Many wounded and doubtless many
killed and drowned. "Wounded and
others on board the Spanish man-of
war and \vard line steamer. Send
lighthouse tender from Key West for
crew and a few pieces of equipment.
Vessel still above water. No one had
other clothes than those upon him.
"Public opinion should be sus
pended until further report. All the
officers are believed to be saved. Jen
kins and Merritt are not yet ac
counted for. Many Spanish officers,
including representatives of General
Blanco, now with me and express
sympathy. SIGSBEE."
The officers referred to in the above
dispatch, are Lieutenant Friend W.
Jenkins and Assistant Engineer Dar
win R. Merritt.
From the wording of the dispatch
the Navy Department think it is pos-

sible that they were on shore at the
time of the acident.
The Secretary of the Navy received
another dispat h from Key West at
the same time with the above, but its
contents were not made public.
The orders for the light-house ten
ders were at once sent to Key West
in plain language, thus avoiding the
delay that would have arisen from the
use of a cipher.
Secretary Long received Captain
Pigsbee's dispatch but a few minutes
before the Associated Press dispatches
were handed him. He received the
news with apparent calm, and his first
act was to comply with f'aptain Rigs
bee's request that assistance be sent
from Key West. He Mired Captain
Forsythe at Key West to proceed with
the navaJ tender Fern to Havana hax
bor.
Secretary Long then sent for Captain
Dickens, and the two discussed Captain
Sigsbee's brief telegram. No other
naval officers were present, and besides
the Secretary and Captain Dickens the
naval colony here is ignorant of this
disaster, the greatest which has be
fallen the American navy since the
storm in Apia many years ago.
The Secretary is inclined to believe
that most of the officers of the Maine
were on shore at the time of the acci
dent, as it was still in the night.
While neither the Secretary nor Cap
tain Dickens is inclined to discuss the
probable cause of the accident, seve
ral suggestions were ventured. ' They

Of course, this is mere speculation, and

OFFICERS OF THE NAVY
HOLD HURRIED CONFERENCE
Great Excitement Created at Key-
West by the Receipt of the
Startling News.
KEY WEST, Feb. 16.â This has cer
tainly been the m*-~t eventful night ev
er witnessed in Key West. The excite
ment commenced shortly before 10
o'clock last night, when the first report
was received that the famous tug
Dauntless had arrived at a port on the
east coast and was taking on arms and
ammunition for Cuba,
The celebrated little filibuster was re
ported to have arrived at Palm Beach
this morning with a load of men and

made to detain her. The information
was immediately conveyed to the com

who commenced to make preparations
to Intercept the filibusters.

PEOPLE CLAMOR FOR WAR,
GOVERNMENT WANTS PEACE.
Copyrighted 1898 by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID. Feb. 15.â Puplic feeling here against the United States is
very highly strung. In the public mind the firm conviction is that the
United States means to force war upon Spain and that the latter must
absolutely stand her ground; that in Cuba the autonomists would side
â with Spain, righting against United States troops, and that if the
Spaniards would encourage the landing of American troops in the
greatest number possible, now that the unhealthy season is coming on,
it would kill them off like flies.
At the same time ships of war could bombard the coast towns,
which, with the exception of New York, are considered unprotected, the
United States not having sufficient warships to guard them.
Great calculations are also made on the widespread ruin which
would fall upon business men in the United States, whereas the bourse
here would scarcely change, as would be the case with the United
States. A war would merely be the first step toward the solution of a
question which is slowly bleeding the resources of the country to death.
Such is the representative idea of public Spanish feeling to-day;
but, mark you, do not quote it as the Government's. The action of the
Government, telegraphed to you last evening, has not popularized it at
home. There are indications that the Ministers are not displeased to
get rid of a representative who could not sincerely reflect their feel
ings, for Senor de Lome was a fervent member of the National party,
headed by Senor Romero Robledo and General Weyler. The Govern
ment feels relief now at having one of Its own men, who truly repre
sents the most liberal ideas of the Cabinet, and who starts full of the
idea of the importance of pushing the commercial treaty, the details of
which he is far more fitted to deal with than was Senor de Lome.
SPANIARDS ARE
NOW IN A MOST
WARLIKE MOOD
Clamoring for Conflict While the
Two Nations Are Closing
the De Lome In
cident.
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The administration offices were deeply
gratified to-day by the Herald's an-
nouncement from Madrid that Spain
would make a complete and satisfac
tory disavowal of the De Lome letter.
This is the only authentic information
which has reached here, the only offi
cial dispatch on the subject being the
one received yesterday from Minister
Woodford stating that Senor Sagasta
had promised that a satisfactory dis
avowal would he made. In the light of
this and the Herald's dispatch this
morning the authorities now no longer
hesitate to say that the incident is
closed, and that all that remains is
the publication of Spain's reply, which
will follow as soon as Minister Wood
ford is heard from. With the arrival
of the new Minister active negotia
tions in connection with the proposed
new commercial treaty will begin.
By this action Spain will attempt to
show the world that the statements
made by Senor de Lpme that she was
insincere in her desire to negotiate a
reciprocity convention are untrue.
When Senor Louis Polo de Bernabe is
formally presented to the President it
is expected there will be an exchange
of addresses which will contain ex

pressions of friendship and g^od will
and demonstrate that harmony exists
in the relations between the two Gov
ernments. Calderon Carlisle, attorney
for Senor Canalejas, in the matter of
securing a return of the letter ad
dressed to him by Senor De Lome
and which caused the resignation of
the latter here as Minister, is con
sidering: what steps shall be taken to
detect and punish the person or per
sons who abstracted the commumoa
tion from the mails.
"We know, of course," said an offi
cial in the State Department to me to
day, "that Mr. Carlisle's object in ob
taining the letter is to use it as evi
dence in any prosecution that might be
inaugurated against the person or per
sons who stole the letter or who have
had it in their possession. If the letter
was stolen, then the person or persons
in whose possession it was might be
Indicted for being receivers of stolen
goods. It seems to me that the Cuban
Junta made" a mistake in turning that
letter over to the State Department
without at least securing a promise
for its return."
Mr. Carlisle declines to state what
action he proposes against any of the
persons who may have been responsi
ble for the publication of the letter.

De Lome's Letter Gives the Govern-
merit More Offense Than Was

Copyrighted. 189 R. by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, Feb. 15.â The Government
org&D F.i Correo, says of Senor de
Lome's letter: "It gives the Spanish
Government offense far exceeding that
to the President of the United States.
Against the injurious words to the
President we protest. We deplore the
imputation against the Spanish Gov
ernment and we resent it exceedingly.
It is deplorable that a public function- â¢
ary, invested with a diplomatic char
acter, could write even in a private
letter ideas which are so disgraceful
as those from the pen of the late Min
ister to Washington."
El Heraldo says: "The Spanish Gov
ernment has nothing to do with the
letter. It did not inspire a single par
agraph and had no idea of us exis
tence."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â The late
Spanish Minister, Senor Dupuy de
Lorn% accompanied by Mrae. de Lome,2
their two sons and a Spanish valet,
left Washington at 4 o'clock this after
noon for New York, whence they sail
to-morrow for Liverpool. A large del
egation from the diplomatic corps, ac
companied by their wives, gave a
hearty au revlor at the station to their
iate associate. Mme. de Lome carried
a bouquet of red roses, and several
baskets of flowers were carried by the
attendants and placed in the car occu
pied by the De Lome party. The en
tire staff of the Spanish legation, head
ed by Senor Dubose, the Charge d'Af
faires, was present, and others at the
station were Count and Countess de
Lichtervelde of the Belgian Legation,
Viscount and Viscountess de Sauto-

Mr. Piedoa, the Swiss Minister; Gen
eral Rengieof of the Colombian Lega

ter of the Netherlands; Count d'Ar
cos of Spain; Mr. Gana, the Chilean
Minister, and Mine. Gana, and Senor
Corea of the Central American Lega
tion. Mme. Gana brought a handsome
bouquet and handed it to Mme. de
Lome Just before the train passed out.
Senor de Lome passed among his for
mer associates, giving them a warm
farewell, and Mme. de Lome waved
her adieux to the men and embraced
the ladies. Quite a number of outsiders
were attracted by the gathering, but

parture was entirely quiet and unob
trusive.

HAVANA, Feb. 15.â 1t is announced
In Spanish circles that Senorlta Isabel
Rubio, who is described as an Amazon,
was captured after being wounded in
a skirmish between a detachment of
Spanish troops and some insurgents in
the province of Pinar del Rio. Senorita
Rubio, it appears, joined the insurgents
at the invitation of the late Antonio
Maceo. She is said to belong to a prom

CHICAGO, Feb. 15.â One of the signs
of the times was the hurried mustering
to-night of four new companies to
raise the Seventh Regiment, Illinois
National Guard, to its full strength.
The order was received from the Gov
ernor early in the afternoon, and
though only circulated by word of
mouth and mail by officers, more can
didates for enlistment presented them
selves at the armory to-night than
would have filled twice as many com
panies as were needed. Though noth
ing was paid that would give the official
color to the belief the order was given
in anticipation of a call by the Govern
ment for troops for service In a Cuban
campaign, yet it was noticeable that
every officer addressing the men re
verted to the possibility of being called
upon for Cuban duty, and was heartily
cheered by men.

few vessels here available. There were
the torpedo boats Cushing and Erics
son and the supply boat Fern, which
arrived yesterday from the fleet at
Dry Tortugas. All the other naval
vessels had been scattered at different
points in the gulf.
Then came the report that the bat
tleship had been blown up. This news
was first received by the commandant
of the station, who In turn communi
cated the information to the several
officers in command. A telephone mes
sage was sent the commanding army
officer at the barracks.
Meanwhile the news rapidly spread
over the entire city, and the cable of
fice became the center of attraction.
The fact that the two torpedo boats
were getting up steam and would be
ready to sail added to the excitement.
A hurried conference was meanwhile
being had between several naval offi
cers present, and a line of action
. promptly decided upon.
The torpedo boat Ericsson was first
to get under way. She steamed out
with open throttles and headed for the
westward. While it is not positively
known where she has gone the im
pression is she has been dispatched to
the Dry Tortugas to notify Admiral
Sicard of the disaster to the Maine.
The Cushing is puffing at the wharf
ready to steam out and apparently only
waiting orders to proceed to Havana.
As I write this dispatch, at 3 a. m.,
the quartermaster of the supply boat
Fern is sitting in the cable office wait
ing to receive any message that may
come for the general.
Every Government vessel in the har
bor is getting ready to sail for Havana
as soon as orders are received.
RELIEF MEASURES
FOR THE SURVIVORS.
Reports Made to the State Depart
ment and to the President on
the Disaster.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.âCom- \
mnader Dickins, after carrying out I
the Instructions of Secretary Long
with regard to relief measures for the ;
survivors of the Maine, went at once !
to the White House, where the Presi- j
dent was aroused and informed of the i
disaster. President McKinley received
the news calmly and expressed his
deep sorrow, but said nothing further,
except that he was thoroughly satis
fied with the measures adopted by the !
Navy Department.
Secretary Long retired at 4 a. m. and â 
orders that all further dispatches \
from Havana should be transmitted to
Captain Dickens.
It is learned that Secretary Long's ;
second dispatch from Key West, which |
was not given out, was merely from '
Captain Forsyth, confirming the mes
sage of Captain Sigsbee.
"THIS IS DREADFUL,"
SAYS DUPUY DE LOME.
The Ex-Spanish Minister Is Badly !
Shocked, but Declares There
Will Not Be War.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â At 5:30 a. m.
Dupuy de Lome, the ex-Minister of *
Spain to the United States, was awak
ened by a reporter and informed of the
blowing up of the Maine. De Lome ap
peared extremely agitated.
"This is dreadful, awful," he said. "I
pray God this news is not true. I pray
God that it is a mistake. Why, I have
I many dear friends on board the Maine
â men that I know intimately in Wash
1 lngton. I should feel their loss more
j than would most Americans.
"It cannot be the result of any Span
ish agency at all. The Spanish min
istry and the Spanish people have been
1 greatly misunderstood in this country.
' They all desire peace; they all want
i peace with America and Americans, not
only from motives of policy, but be
cause they love America.
"I am forced to say now by this ter
i rible affair what I should have been
| precluded from saying before. Spain
cannot afford to have war with the
! United States. If only from motives
of policy they are determined not to
have any war. There can be no war
; between this country and Spain. Such
a thing is out of the question.
"If the Maine has been blown up In
Havana harbor it is the result of an
accident. That is absolutely certain.
There will be nojwar."
WILD EXCITEMENT
AT THE CAPITAL
Nearly Everybody in Washington
Is of the Opinion That Spain
Has Proven Treacherous.
"WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â News of
the disaster at Havana spread rapidly
over the city and the hotel lobbies -and
all public places were crowded with
people eager to hear and discuss every
particle of information as fast as it
wus received.
The wildest reports were in circula
tion, both in regard to the number of
fatalities and the cause of the explo
sion.
Nearly every one seemed to suspect
treachery on the part of Spain or its
over-enthusiastic friends in Havana.
Few would believe the explosion was
the result of an accident, but cooler
heads expressed a willingness to wait
for later news before forming any con
clusion.
President McKinley was greatly agi
tated when he heard the news and he
expressed the hope that it was an acci
dent, making no reference to treachery
In his conversation.
It was stated by a person who came
from the White House that the Presi
dent received the news with perfect
coolness, but that he expressed deep
sorrow for the sailors who lost their
lives.
At the Army and Navy Club there
were groups of deeply interested offi
cers, some of them showing their deep
sorrow in every word and look for
their acquaintances aboard the Maine.
Meager information concerning the
cause of the explosion prevented any
intelligent discussion of the probable
outcome, and none could be found by
the correspondent of The Call willing
to venture an opinion.
There is much conjecture as to what
course is being or will be pursued by
the Government.
Among laymen abroad at this hour
a strong jingosplritismanifested.andit
is feared this feeling will be so intense
throughout the country that the con
; servatives will be swopt off their feet
i when the day dawns, unless it is made
; unmistakably plain that the disaster
was the result of an accident and not
of Spanish design.
Long after midnight the telegraph of
fices were besieged by friends of those
known to be on board the Maine. Many
[of the officers and men have friends,
' some families, L. this city, and some of
the latter were in a state of excitement
better imagined than described.
They were almost beside themselves
when they learned that 100 lives were
lost. But when news came later that
'â  over 200 had been killed they wrung
their hands and begged piteously for
j the names of the lost.
There were no crumbs of comfort for
i any one, every new report picturing
! the disaster as more terrible than the
i one preceding it.
THE EXPLOSION IN THE
FORE PART OF THE MAINE.
Not in the Powder Magazines, Which
Captain Sigsbee Says Were in
Perfect Order.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â The Worlds
Havana correspondent says: The cx
i plosion was in the fore part of the ves
j sel, and not in the powder magazines,
! which Captain Sigsbee says were in
perfect order.
Captain Sigsbee although badly
j wounded in the face, was very cool in
giving orders to officers and : .?n.
The officers also showed great cool
1 noss and valor in giving orders to the
j men. They were in their shirt sleeves,
i having been hurled from their bunks.
! At this moment they are bringing in
j the wounded to the land. Some are
â  mortally wounded and will probably
â¢ die.
Five minutes after the explosion the

THE MAINE PRACTICALLY
A NEW BATTLESHIP.
Was Built in 1890 at New York, and
Had a Complement of
874 Men.
The second-class battleship Mairie
! was built at the United States navy
j yard at New York in 1890. Her dimen
i sions are as follows: Length, 310 feet;
> breadth, 57 feet; draught, 21Vfe feet. The
i Maine was of 6648 tons displacement.
I She was provided with engines of 9000
' horse-power, and could maintain a
speed of seventeen knots an hour. She
carried twin screw engines, vertical and
with triple expansion. Her armor was
eleven inches in thickness. The fight

breech-loading rifles. As a secondary
battery she carried fourteen rapid-fire,
four revolving cannon and four Gat

complement of 874 men.
SPANISH CRUISER
VIZCAYA ARRIVES TO-DAY.
And in the Event of War New York
City Would Be at the Mercy
of Her Guns.
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â The Spanish
armored cruiser Vizcaya, with a crew
of 484 men, Is expected to arrive In
New Fork harbor some time to-mor
row. To-night the United States war
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1898.
ship nearest to this port was the ar
mored cruiser Brooklyn, which was in
Hampton Roads, 350 miles away. It
would take eighteen hours of record
steaming for the Brooklyn to reach
here from the Virginia 6hores.
Naval men say the Vizcaya could de
molish the greater part of Greater New
York in less than two hours. There are
no warships in the Brooklyn navy
yard which could be made ready for
service in less than two months. The
cruisers Atlanta and Chicago are there,
but they are at present nothing more
than useless hulks. Their engines, fun
nels and boilers are stripped of arma
ment, and in a fight theshlps would not
be as serviceable as a ferry boat. The
dispatch boat Dolphin, the Presidential
yacht, is also in the navy yard, in the
stone dry dock, being refitted with new
boilers. She could not be made ready
for a sea trip inside of two months.
In an engagement with the Vizcaya's
type she would be as impotent as a
baby against Sandow. The Vizcaya
comes here ostensibly on a visit of
courtesy.
Captain Gilmour, chief aid to Com
mandant Bunce at the Brooklyn Navy
yard, was asked to-day what protec
tion the people of New York would
have against the guns of the Vizcaya if
war with Spain were begun while she
was anchored in the harbor, and all
the American warships at distant
points.
"This country would not declare war
under such conditions," said the cap
tain.
"But suppose Spain should take ad
vantage of the opportunity and declare
war?"
"Why, the Vizcaya would be invited
to leave the harbor," replied the cap
tain. "At t any rate it would be a sui
cidal proceeding for her to bombard the
city. She could never leave the har
bor. The forts would see to that. But
there is little doubt that when the
Spanish warship arrives there will be
an American man-of-war close at hand
to take care of her. It is not likely
she will be long in the harbor unat
tended."
GREAT INTEREST
IS MANIFESTED.
Excitement in New York and In
quiries From Many of the
European Capitals.
NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â News of the
Maine disaster created wild speculation
and great excitement in the navy yard.
The extraordinary nature of the inter
est manifested in the news of the dis
aster may be gained from the fact that
long after midnight the officials of the
State Department were aroused by
messengers bearing dispatches froni
European capitals asking for verifica
tion. From such distant points even
as Glasgow and Paris these inquiries
were wired to Washington.
NAVAL FOOTING OF
THE TWO NATIONS.
Comparative Strength of Spain and
the United States Duly Set
Forth.
At this time a comparison of our
: navy with that of Spain will prove
iof interest. The revolution in the
, methods of naval warfare makes
it impossible to estimate the strength
\of a navy by the number of
i ships or the weight of its guns. It may
, be that in the next great naval con
' filet some one small vessel will show
I that it can destroy the combined navies
| of the world; and it is almost certain
: that some of the battleships or armored
' cruisers will prove as destructive to
j the unarmored or protected cruis rs as
j the Virginia would have been to our
â  wooden fleet had the Monitor not
i stopped her career so suddenly t in
[ Hampton Roads.
While there will doubtless be desul-
I tory fighting among cruisers, it will be
! mere "out-post skirmishing," amount
: ing to little. The real fighting will be
j between battleships and their supports
I â protected cruisers and coast-defense
vessels fitted for seagoing.
Battleships are divided into three
! classes. The first (A) includes those of
j 8000 tons or more, built since 1890; or, if
before that, of 9500 tons. They are gen
erally considered as equal in strength,
I but in any close calculation this would
not be fair. Some are much more heav
ily armed than others, while some are
faster and stronger armored. Of ves
sels of this class Spain has but one, the
Pelayo, and the United States has nine
â four in service and five under con
! struction.
The Pelayo is a prand fight. ng ma
chine of 9900 tons with 17.7 inches of
steel armor, carrying two 12.5-inch
guns, two 11-inch, one 6-inch, twelve
4.7-inch, and smaller guns. She has
seven torpedo tubes. To match her the
United States h..s fie Indiana, Massa
chusetts and Oregon, each of 10,231 tons,
l :th 18-inch steel armor, carrying four
13-inch guns, arranged as the Pelayo's
four he-vy guns are â fore and aft and
broadside â and eight 8-inch guns in
barbette, six 4-inch quick-firing guns,
and seven torpedo tubes.
Either of these three would be mope
than a match for the Pelayo, being
larger, more heavily armed, and sailing
fifteen knots to her twelve. The lowa
would be a fairer mateh â of 11,296 tons,
with fourteen inches of steel armor
carrying four 12-inch, eight 8-inch,
and six 4-inch guns, with six torpedo
tubes.
The battle-ship of the second class
(B) Is one of 7000 tons or upward,
launched since 1871, not included in the
first class; and neither Spain nor the
United States has one.
All other battle-ships are put In the
third (C) class. They are those under
7000 tons. The United States has one â
the Texas â and Spain has two â the Nu
mancia and Vitoria â but the latter are
of the old-fashioned broadside type
built in 1865 carrying muzzle-loading,
10-inch Armstrong guns, while the Tex
as is of the '95 model, carrying two 12
inch breech-loaders and able to outsail,
outmaneuver and . outfight the two
combined.
To the battle-ship the sea-going coast
defense ironclad may be expcÂ»cted to
give great assistance. Spain has none
â the two little ones of 500 and 700 tons
used as school ships being out of the
count. The United States has elx â
three double turreted monitors and
three with double-headed barbettes of
4000 to 6000 tons each, and each carry
ing four 10-inch breech-loaders.
Armored cruisers are for fighting
mainly. They are brevet battle ships.
Spain has fourâ Emperado Carlos V,
Almirante, Oquendo, Vizcaya and In
fanta Maria Teresa â afloat, and four
building, ranging from 6890 tons to 9090
tOtti, each carrying two 11-inch "breech
loaders in turrets. The United States
has three â Brooklyn, New York, Maine
â of equal tonnage, armed with lighter
guns, but more of them en barbette.
A fight between the Brooklyn and
Carlos V would settle the disputed
question of armament, as to whether
the two 11-inch guns in turret were
a match for eight 8-inch guns in bar
bette. The Spanish vessels have been
built, like ours, since 1890; but they
represent an entirely different prin
ciple in construction and armament,
and which is the better has yet to be
proved. Here is a brief table for com
parison:
CARLOS V. BROOKLYN.
Tonnage, 9090. Tonnage. 9153.
2 turrets. 4 barbettes.
2 11-lnnh B. 8 8-Inch B.
10 S'/i-lnoh Q. 12 5-inch Q.
4 4-lnch Q. 12 8-pdr. Q.
2 10-prlr. Q. 4 i-pdr. Q.
4 6-prtr. Q. 4 maeh.
4 1-pdr. Q. 5 torpedo tubes.
2 maoh.
6 torpedo tubes.
The armament is lightâ one 8-inch
breech-loader, two 6-inch quick-firing,
eight 4-inch twelve pounders and six
torpedo tubes, but they can outÃteam
anything in the Spanish navy, and de
stroy any vessel lighter armedâgun
boats and protected cruisers â with
practical impunity.
The armor of the American is much
heavier, the barbette being protected by
fifteen inches, and the turrets by only
ten inches. In addition, the American
quick-firing guns are protected by 4
inch shields.
The last in the battle line are the
"protected" cruisers. Of these there are
three classesâ over and under 6000 tons
and under 3000 tonsâ G, H and J. Spain
has one of the first class (G) and the
United States has two, the Minneapo
11b and the Columbia.
Of the second class (H) Spain has two
âAlfonso XIII and Lepanto, carrying
four 7.8-inch B, and six 4.7-inch B. The
j United States has elevenâ Olympia,
I Philadelphia, Chicago, Newark, San
Francisco, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Ra
leigh, Charleston, Atlanta and Boston.
Each one is better protected than the
Spanish type, but while some are more j
heavily armed, the majority of them '
are less heavily armed. The Olympia j
carries four 8-inch and ten 5-inch guns, j
j the Baltimore four 8-inch and six 6- |
J inch, but the Chicago carries only four- I
j teen 5-inch guns, the Newark twelve !
6-lnch and the Raleigh one 6-inch and
ten 5-inch guns.
Of the third class (J), under 3000 tons,
Spain has purchased one built for the
Japanese Government at Kiel. It has j
not yet been named or armed. The
| United States has the Marblehead, De- !
I troit and Montgomery, each carrying !
j nine 6-lnch quick-firing guns.
In addition to several light-draft j
gunhoats building, the United States
has thirteen torpedo boats in various I
stages of construction, but most of
! them will be ready before the close of
j the present year.
Spain has under construction In her |
! own yards at the present time, In ad- j
. dition to the vessels named, four ar- !
i mored cruisers, four protected cruisers, !
; four gunboats,, four torpedo-boats and ,
three battle-ships, to be equipped with
armament and motive power in France, j
From this brief review of the fighting I
1 strength of the two navies it will be
, seen that the United States has a great
i advantage over Spain in every respect.
HYDROPHOBIA WITHOUT
BEING BITTEN BY A DOG.
Strange Case of a Swedish Servant
Girl Who Died in a new York
Hospital.
NEW YORK, Foli 15.â It appears from
the history of Ellen Callson, the 19-year
old Swedish girl who died In Roosevelt
Hospital, that a person may become in
fected with hydrophobia without being
bitten by a dog. An autopsy upon the
girl's body marie to-day revealed the
fact that her death was caused by hydro
phobia, although so far as can be learned
no dog over l)it her.
The girl was employed as a servant by
a family at Congers, N. Y. She was
brought to the hospital on Sunday after
noon, apparently suffering with a vio
lent attack of rabies. She seemed to
be suffocating and had the hallucinations
usual in such eases. Where she was
employed there were three large New
foundland dogs of which she was very
fond. One of the dogs died on November
20, a second on November SO, and the
third on Jaunary 20. A veterinary who
attended them found no trace of rabies
in any of them, yet to them is traced
the fatal malady of the girl. The
presumption is that the germs were com
municated to her by dogs licking her
hands which were badly chapped.
"THUNDERBOLT" IS EASY.
The Colored Heavy Weight Knocked
Out by Maher in Three
Bounds.
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. 15.â Peter Ma
her and "Thunderbolt" Smith, the colored.
Buffalo heavy weight, met at the Arena
in this city to-night In a six-round bout,
and Malier won in the third round. The
fighting was fast, and Maher had all the
better of It.
In the final round Smith landed a hard
left on Maher's ear. Maher countered
with his left on Smith's face and repeated
the blow twice. Smith ducked into an
uppercut and Maher sent left and right
on his opponent's head. He again landed
his left and right on Smith's face, knock
ing him down. As Smith rose to his feet
Maher banged him repeatedly on the face
and jaw and "Thunderbolt" went to the
floor again. Maher kept after him and
soon had him in a groggy condition, hang-
Ing onto the ropes. To save a knockout,
Smith threw up his hands and quit.
Brutality of a Husband.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 15.â A pitiful case
of cruelty and a woman's suffering came

was reported to the District Attorney to
be starving. An investigation disclosed
the fact that Mrs. Rossi had been with
out food for days; that her husband had
forced her to work until from weakness
and exhaustion she dropped to the floor,
and lay In a semi-conscious condition.
Mrs. Rossi has five children. They were
placed in an orphan asylum and Mrs.
Rossi given a berth at the poor farm.

WITH THE LAW
Attorney-General Griggs
and the Sale of the
Kansas Pacific.
Replies to the Questions in the
Senate Resolution of
Inquiry.
Property Will Be Sold to the Highest
Bidder and Government
Claims Paid in Full.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 15.
Attorney-General Grlggs replied to
day to the Harris resolution, which
passed the Senate. The Attorney-Gen
eral says that the Government has al
ready complied with the decree of the
court which entitled it to become a
bidder. If the sale was allowed to pro
ceed upon the adjourned day, with no
chance of a bid equal to the amount of
the principal of the Government's debt,
1/ would be incumbent upon him to bid
on the property for the Government.
This would have been attended with
difficulties, which would be mainly
that the Government was not author
ized to operate the railroad in its own
name or through its agencies, and seri
ous doubt existed as to whether the
court would, after the sale, appoint and
continue receivers for the mere purpose
of operating the road on behalf of the
Government. He then refers to what
took place in St. Louis when the reor
ganization committee offered to bid the
amount of the principal of the Govern
ment debt. In conslusion he says:
"Answering specifically the questions
contained in the resolution of the Sen
ate, I would say I have not authorized
any agreement by which the property
is to be sold for the face value of sub
sidy bonds, nor has the Government
agreed not to be a bidder at the sale.
The only agreement made was to dis
continue the motion for postponement,
a redemption and the appointment of
a receiver, upon the guarantee that the
minimum bid by the reorganization
should be the principal of the Govern
ment debt. The property will be sold
at public sale In open competition to
such party as may offer the highest
bid, subject only to the stipulation ob
tained in open court on Saturday last,
that the minimum bid will be $6,303,000
instead of J2.500.000, as formerly fixed
by the court."
REORGANIZERS TO
BUY THE PROPERTY.
To-Day Uncle Sam Will Foreclose
the Liens on the Kansas
Pacific Property.
TOPEKA, Kan., Feb. 15. â To-morrow
TV. D. Cornish of Omaha, sperlal mas-
ter, will sell the Government lien on the
Union Pacific Railroad in Kansas. The
upset price of the Government Hen is
$6, 303,000. A. W. Krech of New York
will make the purchase for the reor
ganization committee, which is the new
Union Pacific Company. Special Mas
ter Cornish will sell under a special
mortgage the eastern division of the
Union Pacificâ l4o miles. The upset
price Is to be $4,500,000. Krech also will
buy this property for the new com
pany.
On Friday Cornish will sell under a
special mortgage, and Krech will buy
for the company, the middle divi
sion of the Union Pacificâ 2s4 miles.
This sale will take place at Salina.
The upset price is to be $5,300,000.
On Saturday, the entire line, from
Kansas City to Denver, will be sold
under the consolidated mortgage. This
sale will be made in North Topeka.
The upset price is to be $8,000,000.
There was a talk for a while that
the Alton would make an effort to get
hold of the Union Pacific road in Kan
sas, but nothing has been heard about
it lately. The reorganization commit
tee will have a clear field.
In the advertisement for the sale of
the Union Pacific road in Kansas, the
property has been referred to as the
Kansas Pacific, that being the name of
the original companyâ the company
with which the Government first did
business.
SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
Passage of the Bill to Amend the
Navigation Laws.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â The House
put In a busy day. The time was devoted
to the consideration of bills and joint res
olutions under the call of committees, and
sixteen of more or less public importance
were passed. An order was entered for
the consideration of the Loud bill relat
ing to eecond-class mail matter on March
1, 2 and 3, and the order for the consider
ation of the bankruptcy bill, which begins
to-morrow, was modified so that the final
vote shall be taken on Saturday inÃtead
of Monday as arranged last week.
Payne (Rep.) of New York, chairman of
the Committee on Merchant Marine,
called up the bill to amend the naviga
tion laws of the United States. Payne ex-
Slained that the bill had been prepared
y the Treasury Department and was de
signed to protect our sea coast trade
along the Pacific Coast with Alaska.
After some argument the bill was
passed.
Loud (R.) of California, from the Com
mittee on Postofflces and Post Roads,
called up the bill to make it lawful to
transmit through the mails private pos
tal cards with a one-cent stamp affixed.
The bill was passed. Loud stated that
it was very important that the House
should act on the bill relating to a di
vision of the law relating to second-class
mail matter, as the postofflce appropria
tion bill was being held up, pending the
decision of the House on that measure.
He asked that March 1 and 2 be devoted
to its consideration.
Loud then called up a bill reported by
his committee requiring prepayment of
postage on all first-class mall matter,
but after a brief debate it was recom
mitted.
A bill was passed empowering registers
and receivers of general land offices to
Issue subperaa and compel attendance.
A bill was r issed repealing the statute
requiring affirmative proof of loyalty by
the holders of bounty or land warrants.
At 5 o'clock the House adjourned.
Sought to Incinerate His Employer.
WALNUT CREEK, Feb. 15.â John Eaw
ler, who for the past ten years has been
employed on the ranch of A. P. Penlman,
has confessed that he set fire to his em
ployer's barn, which, with its contents
of hay, grain and farm implements, was
burned on Sunday. He says that he ex
pected his employer would perish in the
flames. Lawler is said to be addicted to
morphine, and his friends allege that he
committed arson while temporarily in
sane. The damage to the barn was" $5000.
Lawler has been arrested, and will be
tried for arson.

OF LEGAL LORE
Selma's Alleged Firebug
Placed in a Bad
Light.
Officers Discover Accused At
torney Robinson's Law-
Books.
Removed From His Office Before the
Fire and Buried Near His
House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Feb. 15.â The' officers of
Selma worked all last night and un
til 11 o'clock to-day searching for evi
dence against Edward J. Robinson, the
young attorney who was arrested on a
charge of arson, and who is now in the
County Jail here awaiting trial. The
lawyer was arrested for an attempt
to burn the building in which his office
was located in order to get $500 insur
ance on about $100 worth of law books,
and it was ascertained that nearly all
the volumes had been removed from
the office before the fire was started.
The officers made a diligent search to
find the books, believing that Robinson
had secreted them. This forenoon they
made the discovery, and obtained very
damaging evidence against the young
attorney. Deputy Constable Y. A.
Burns searched Robinson's home and
found several of the books, but most
of them were found burled deep in the
ground near his house. The find was
made by Constable E. Vandergrift, who
noticed some loose earth and leaves.
He made an excavation and 149 vol
umes were found buried in a hole
three feet deep, two feet wide and four
or five feet long. The hole was care
fully lined with papers, and the books
were covered with sacks. All the books
had the attorney's name on them, so
there can be no mistake as to the
ownership.
An effort was made to attach them
by the insurance companies to equal
ize the loss on the building, but they
were found to be exempt from execu
tion. Robinson will not make any
statement, but merely exclaims that "it
is all like a dream." He affects mel
ancholia in Jail, and is evidently feign
ing insanity. He is a step-brother of
the Ruggles boys, who were lynched
at Redding Borne time ago.
AMERICANS VIE
WITH MEXICANS
Meeting of Two Governors at
the International Boundary
Line.
Reception and Banquet to McCord of
Arizona and Ramon Corral
of Sonora.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NOGALES, Ariz., Feb. 15.â For weflp
past extensive preparations have bee\
under way for the reception by citizens
of Nogales, Sonora, and Nogales, Ariz.,
to Governor Ramon Corral of Sonora,
Mexico, and Governor M. H. McCord of
Arizona, who now are guests of the twin
cities on the border. The Mexican exec
utive, accompanied by the State officials
and members of the Sonora Legislature,
arrived from Hermosillo last evening. The
hospitality ot Nogales was tendered the
visitors, who stood on Mexican soil to
receive the welcome extended them by
the Anglo-Saxons standing on American
territory, and escorted by Company G,
First Infantry, National Guard ot Ari
zona, and fully half the population of both
cities.
The southbound train to-day brought
Governor McCord, his family and staff
from Phoenix. The two Governors to
day exchanged calls, and many toasts
were proposed in honor of Mexico and the
United States.
Much good is expected to follow the
meeting of the two executives. This
evening a magnificent banquet and ball
were given. To-morow they go to Her
moÃillo, the capital of Sonora, where
elaborate preparations have been made
for their entertainment.
PAY DIRECTOR BILLINGS
15=1 OUT OF THE NAVY.
Dismissed From the Service for Tell-
ing an Untruth to Secretary
Long.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â Luther &.
Billings, pay director in the United States
navy, has .been found guilty by a court
martial which has been in session at the
Washington navy-yard for the past few
days of falsehood and scandalous con
duct, and has been sentenced to dismissal
from the navy. The result of the trial
caused the greatest surprise in naval
circles.
The accused held the highest rank in
the naval pay corps, has a host of friends
and has never before been suspected of
misconduct. The offense charged against
him was in connection with the supply
to the navy of an emergency ration. It
was shown that he, as patentee of such
ration, had turned it over to a stock
company, in which he retained an In
terest, although he had officially denied
the Interest, and that he had been instru
mental in selling the ration to the Gov
ernment. The amount of profit at stake
was so small as to make his conduct in
explicable to the department, but Secre
tary Long, after a thorough Investigation
himself, decided that a court-martial was
necessary, as it was desirable to have it
understood in the most formal fashion
that under no conditions should naval
officers enter into connections that mischt
place their integrity under the faintest
suspicion. It is felt that this result has
now been attained as the reSult of the
conviction of the accused pay inspector.

Medical books are not always inter*

joying good health, but as a matter
of fact scarcely one person in ten is
perfectly healthy, and even with such,
sooner or later sickness must come.
It is also a well established truth
that nine-tenths of all diseases origin-
ate with a breaking down of the di-
gestion, a weak stomach weakens and
impoverishes the system, making it
easy for disease to gain a foothold.
Nobody need fear consumption, kid-
ney disease, liver trouble ot a weak
heart and nervous system as long as
the digestion is good and the stomach
able to assimilate plenty of whole-
some food.
Stomach weakness shows itself in a
score of ways and this little book de-
scribes the symptoms and causes and
points the , way to a cure bo simple
that any one can understand and ap-
ply. . '

Wreckage of the Steam=
ship Clara Nevada
Drifts Ashore.
Parties Sent From Seward City
Find No Trace of Those
Who Were Aboard
the Vessel.
JUNEAXf (Alaska), Feb. 15 (by S. 8. Islander to Victoria).â Cap
tain Thomas Latham of the steamer Coleman has brought to Juneau
the first news of the most horrible wreck of a steamboat that has
ci er occurred In Alaskan waters. While real facts and actual details
are at this writing scarce, there is no doubt that the steamship
Olara Nevada from Seattle on her return trip to Juneau from Dyea
and Skaguay has been wrecked and all hands lost. I had a talk this
evening with Captain Latham. lie said:
"When we put into Seward City at 10:30 o'clock yesterday morn
ing for the mail they asked us what ship had been wrecked. I did not
know of any ship tljat had been wrecked. They then told us that a ship
had exploded or burned about 9 o'clock last Sunday night off Eld
.ridge Point, over toward Sullivan Island, and people of Seward
City pointed to some wreckage lying on the beach close to the wharf.
A heavy gale was blowing Saturday all day and all night. It was
the hardest blow we have had in a long time. No vessel could live in
such weather with anything the matter with her. I was told that
there was a towering puff of flames and then a bright red glow on the
biack waters. This would Indicate that the ship exploded and then
caught fire. She could not have lasted long.
"I examined the wreckage near the dock. It consisted of sky
lights, parts of a deck house, ring buoys, a part of a sewing ma
chine, pillows, chairs, tables, linen, a lot of plank and board on which
at one end was the letter 'A' and on the other 'N' in gilt. The wreck
age had yellow trimmings.
"The Clara Nevada was newly painted and had yellow trimmings.
The Clara Nevada arrived at Skaguay last Friday from Juneau, dis
charged cargo and left early Saturday afternoon for Juneau. I know
she was there at that time and that she left about that time. This
would bring her off Seward City about 9 o'clock at night. She had
aboard a number of passengers for Juneau and some for Seattle â I
don't know how many. Neither those passengers nor the ship have
arrived and this is Thursday, four days later. What has become of
them?
"AmonK the wreckage was a lot of 16-foot planks. The Clara
Nevada had a deck load of lumber. Some of it may have been for
Pyramid Harbor, which she intended to put off on her way back.
"We cruised along the shore to see if we could find anybody, but
saw not a man. I doubt that there have been any survivors of the
shipwreck in such a gale. I intended to go across to the other
shore, but the weather was too thick. Some ship has been lostâ there
is no doubt about that. All the indications point to the Clara Ne
vada."
The Clara Nevada put in here last "Wednesday from Seattle, and
laid over until the next day for repairs to her boilers. It may have
been her boilers that exploded and set fire to the ship. The Clara
Nevada was of 300 or 400 tons burden, a trim craft of symmetrical
lines. She had a heavy cargo and about 100 passengers. There is
no means of telling how many passengers she carried from Dyea and
Skapuay for Seattle and Juneau, but there were undoubtedly a large
number. The list cannot be obtained until the next boat gets in
from Dyea and Skaguay, which may be the Chilcat or the Wolcott.
George Bach of Seward City came down on the Coleman. He cor
roborated Captain Latham's story. He saw the fire (he calls it an ex
plosion) on Saturday and placed the lights on the dock as a signal to
any survivors where to make a landing. None came, though many
persons were aboard the luckless vessel.
Mr. Benicke, formerly of Portland, of the local firm of J. D.
Meyer & Co., is supposed to have left on the Clara Nevada from
Juneau. Friends who have since arrived on the steamship Wolcott
say he told them he expected to leave Skaguay on the Clara Nevada
on Saturday afternoon. He has not been seen since.
The steamship Rustler left Juneau to-night to search for sur
vivors of the Clara Nevada. Searchers from Seward City and Pyra
mid Harbor have not found or seen any camp fires on the shore. The
Rustler will make a thorough search. She Is expected to retur^ in
three days. Boats from the head of Lynn Canal south usually carry
from ten to fifty passengers. It ia feared all aboard the Clara Ne
vada are lost. Many Juneau people and some residents of Seattle are
known to have been, on the ill-fated ship. HAL HOFFMAN.
SEATTLE, Feb. 15.â Intense interest
Is felt here in the reported burning of
the steamship Clara Nevada, which is
several days overdue from Skaguay. It
is difficult to glean any definite infor
mation, and the coming of the steam
ship Queen is anxiously awaited. She
Is due from the north and is expected
to bring some news of the missing ves
sel.
There Is no way at present of ascer
taining Just who were the southbound
passengers on the Clara Nevada. Their
number is supposed to be about forty,
but their names can be obtainedonlyat
the place where they took passage, and
it is very doubtful if anything like a
complete list could be obtained there.
â¢ There seems to be no doubt that a
steamship was burned and those on
board lost, and the continued absence
of the Clara Nevada tends to confirm
the belief that she is the missing ves
sel.
, T. L. Cockrill, A. Baskey and F. S.
Duff, who went to Alaska on the last
trip of the Clara Nevada, arrived to
day on the steamship Kingston from
Victoria, having reached there this
morning on the Islander. These men
sa-sv and talked with the man who
brought the wreck story from Seward
City to Juneau, and in their opinion
there is no doubt as to the truth of
the reported loss of the Clara Nevada.
All three men talked freely to The Call
correspondent, and said that, from
their experience on board the Clara Ne
vada, the report of the explosion of her
boilers did not surprise them in the
least.
They said that the engineer was
constantly at work making repairs on
the boilers from the time the steam
ship left Puget Sound until she reached
Skaguay. At Juneau the steamship
was detained over night in order to
make further repairs.
One of the men, F. S. Duff, left the
vessel at Juneau because, as he said,
he did not consider her safe.
M. Maguire, who has an interest In
the Nevada, had his attention called to
the foregoing statement to-night and
admitted that repairs bad been made
on the .boilers on the way north, ac
cording to a letter the engineer wrote
to him from Juneau, but he says these
repairs were of no consequence and the
damage w-as not such as to in any
way endanger the vessel.
H. N. Rinker, who has been at Ju
neau for several weeks, says that the
Clara Nevada's laundry was left there
with instructions *to have it ready on
the 6th of this month. She did not re
turn and when the story of a burning
Bteainer ' being sighted above Juneau
reached'-that port three days later, it
. wm at once concluded that it could be
I none other than the Clara Nevada,
\ even before the later details came
j tending to confirm this report.

FATHER MEYER'S
DEATH MOURNED
All Los Angeles Grieves Over
the Passing of the
Priest.
Was Ever Ready to Extend a Help
ing Hand to Those in Need
of Assistance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15.â The funeral
services over the body of Very Rev. A.
J. Meyer commenced at 9 o'clock this
morning, and the bell of the church tolled
Just at noon as the funeral procession
filed out of the church. The aisles of the
edifice were crowded, and several hundred
people were unable to find even standing
room.
Father Harnett of East Los Angeles
preached the funeral sermon. He spoke
of Father Meyer as a model for his hear
ers to follow, saying that in him they be
held the life of another Savior. They
could behold in him patience and humility
in a marked degree. When Father Meyer
came to Los Angeles he was not un
known; the Holy Father had offered him
the bishopric of Galveston, but he had
refused the mitre offered by the Pope to
take charge of the boys in St. Vincent's
College.
The many Protestants present testified
to his friendship with tho.se outside the
church. He was never called to care for
the sick that he did not respond. He was
a man. plain, honest, kind and open
handed.
Herr Joseph Rubo sang Mozart's
Domine Jesu Christi, which was a fa
vorite song of the father. Herr Rubo
also sang with the choir the Sanctus and
Agnus Dei from the same mass. Dion
Romany played on his violin, "Nearer
My God to Thee."
The Bishop felt impelled to add a short
address to what Father Harnett had
said. He spoke of the death of Father
Meyer as a common loss to all the peo
ple of Los Angeles. Thi.- Bishop then
performed the final absolutions for the
dead.
As the casket was carried out of the
church it was viewed by hundreds who
had been unable to get into the church.
The cortege was composed of represent
atives of religious societies from all over
the State, and hundreds of the parish
ioners and friends of the late priest. The
interment took place at Calvary Ceme
tery on Boyle Heights.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
. SEATTLE. Feb. 15.â After delays
that seemed interminable, the pack
train detachment of the Government
relief expedition sailed from Seattle on
the three-master ship Lucille late to
night. The work of loading the ship
began last Friday and it was expected
that she would get away by Monday.
One complication after another arose.
The Lucille brought quite a large ex
pedition of freight and passengers and
live stock from San Francisco, destined
for Dyea. When the Government pack
train and equipment were loaded on
board it was found that there was not
room for both parties. The San Fran
cisco people, holding a contract that
was prior in date to that of the Gov
ernment, stood off Lieutenant Ryan
and endeavored to prevent the loading
of the Government mules until their
outfits were aboard. For a time the at
mosphere was blue with rumors of war,
but a truce was patched up and the
San Francisco expedition gave way to
the Government after the company had
arranged to place its freight with the
steamer Farallon.
The Alaska Forwarding Company of
San Francisco, owners of forty mules
and horses and fifty tons of freight
that the Lucille brought from San
Francisco libeled the ship this after
noon for $6000 damages for refusing to
carry out a contract alleged to have
been made in San Francisco for the
transportation of the expedition to
Skaguay. Papers were served in the
suit, but the vessel was not taken in
charge by the Federal court, a com
promise being effected before evening.
Havner & Co., charterers of the Lucille/
agreed to take north on the Farallon
that which it was found impossible to
load on the Lucille.
The Lucille was billed to sail bright
and early this morning. That she did
not get away was a good thing for the
crowds of men and women that throng
ed the dock from morning until dark,
watching the gang of longshoremen
place tons and tons of hay and feed
aboard, ending finally with the inter
esting sight of loading the pack mules
in a heavy wooden stall and hoisting
them into the ship's hold.
The spectators obtained more fun at
the expense of the mules that were
hoisted on board the Lucille than in
any other one thing. Being conserva
tive to a degree of stubbornness, the
average Government pack mule is not
accustomed to ships and hoisting gear
and things of that kind. Naturally the
brutes would object to being hustled
into a boxlike structure made of stiff
fir planks attached to a rope from the
derrick on deck. Ordinarily the dock
hands would seize a mule from behind,
and with the aid of a rope and a few
energetic twist of his tail they would
yank and haul at him until they had
landed him in the stall, when the doors
at either end would be bolted tight.
Then would follow the amusing part of
the scene. As the rope stiffened and
the carriage began to raise the mule
would stamp and tug at the halter and
at the ropes that bound him down. One
brute actually screamed as he arose in
the air and gazed terror-stricken at
the rapidly receding crowd on the
wharf. Finally, however, the last mule
was safely stowed below the upper
deck, the last dog was led up the gang
plank, and the last bale of hay and
pound of feed was stowed away in the
hold.

ARRESTED WHEN ABOUT
TO LEAVE FOR ALASKA.
Besident of San Jose Charged With
the Bobbery of His Business
Partner.
SAN JOSE, Feb. lt>.âJ. R. Young, who
was arrested in San Francisco yester
day on a charge of felony embezzle
ment as he was about to depart for the
Klondike, was returned to this city this
evening by Deputy Constable Benja
min.
Young and E. R. Mundelius were, until
a short time ago, partners in a brass
foundry works located on North San Pe
dro street. Business became dull and
Mundelius proposed to Young that he
(Young) run the business, while Mun
delius would go down and look after his
ranch, located near Hollister. Young con
sented and matters were arranged" that
way. Soon afterward, Young disposed
of the entire plant and left for San
Francisco, preparatory to' starting for the
Klondike. Mundelius, not having re
ceived any accounting from Young, took
a trip up here to see how things were
getting along, and then made the dis
covery. He immediately went before
Justice Kirkpatrick and caused the war
rant to be issued, upon which Young was
arrested.
Mundelius claims that among other
things contained in the foundry there were
a valuable gasoline engine, lathe, metal
and tools, all of a combined value of not
less than $500. He says that every article
was sold by Young, who pocketed the
proceeds for the purpose of getting quiet
ly away to the mines.

COLUMBIA CREEK
THE RICHEST IN
THE YUKON LAND
Ex-State Senator Richards of Oregon Writes of
Recent Big Strikes in the Northern
Country.
POMONA. Feb. 15.â S. A. Richards of San Bernardino County, re
ceived a letter yesterday from his brother, Hugh, who went to Daw
son City last July. The letter was written at Dawson on December
24 and was mailed at Victoria, B. C, last Sunday.
Hugh Richards was formerly a State Senator in Oregon. He writes
his brother that the richest strikes of the past six months have been
made on Columbia Creek, and that the very highest record of gold
washing by pans in freezing cold weather was made there In the last
days of November.
Three brothers â James, William and Albert Hohnâ were among the
first to strike it rich there last August. They went to Dawson from
Ventura, California, where they were very poor and eked out a liveli
hood by bee raising. Richards writes that together they have already
over $160,000 in gold stored in oil cans and sacks of skins ready for
shipment to San Francisco. Their claim is worth easily $600,000*
more. They found bedrock about fourteen feet below the surface,
and in one month they took out from a hole twelve feet square over
$50,000 worth of gold. In the last week of September they got out over
sixty pounds of gold. When they come to sluicing their gravel more
carefully next May they will surely get thousands of dollars more of
gold dust and nuggets.
Richards writes that he has not yet known of any exaggeration of
the quantity of gold in the Klondike region. He says that no one can
have any idea what an immense amount of gold Alaska and the
Klondike are going to yield until they see mining there for them
selves. He says that all the original claims on Bonanza and El Do
rado creeks are yielding as much gold now as one year ago. Some
men who have mined constantly since the first rush to Dawson in
September, 1896, have on hand over $300,000 worth of gold ready for
transportation to the United States when navigation opens, and he
thinks that at least $18,000,000 will come out of the Klondike region be
fore navigation closes next September. Some people put it at $25,000,
000.

Large Party of Eastern
Men Sails From

Prominent Pennsylvanians Led

War.

counter Resistance From In

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Feb. 15.â The steamship
Alliance sailed late to-night for Port
Valdez, Alaska, via Dyea and Skaguay,
with 250 passengers. Her return to this
port may be expected in about twenty
five days.
The Keystone Company, made up
principally of people of Braddock and
Beaver Falls, Pa., and acquaintances in
Seattle, left on the Alliance, intending
to go into the Copper River country.
There are a number of prominent men,
including lawyers, one doctor and other
professional gentlemen, as well as me
chanics and civil engineers. Colonel
Creighton, a war veteran, who com
manded a company of cavalry during
the civil war, and who took a party of
explorers and miners into the interior
of Alaska eleven years ago. is in charge
of the party. They purpose if gold is
not found in paying quantities upon the
tributaries of the Copper River to pass
over to the headwaters of the Tanana.
Colonel Creighton says that the talk
of the hostilities of the Copper River
Indians Is simply nonsense; that they
are the most inoffensive of people and
that in all parts of the territory the
natives are kind ami hospitable. He
thinks it unfortunate that so many
are going north without being advised
of the conditions, privations and hard
ships that they will have to encounter.
Many will blunder around for more
than a year before they will know as
much about the country as they should
know before starting.
VIOLATING THE
ANTITRUST LAW
Bill Introduced in the Ohio
Legislature to Regulate the
Associated Press.
The Organization May Be Compelled
to Servo All Newspapera
That Apply.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 15.â The Asso
ciated Press is looked upon by Attorney-
General Monnett and a great many mem
bers cf the General Assembly as a trust,
which is doing business in violation of the
Sherman anti-trust law. A bill was In
troduced In the Senate to-day by Mr.
Dodge which seeks to compel the asso
ciation to furnish its news service to all
Ohio papers which are now denied it.
The measure provides that all Ohio news
papers be entitled to service upon pay
ment of proper tolls, and that those
which are denied it shall have recourse' to
civil action for damages.
The measure was prepared by Attorney-
General Monnett, who gives it as his
opinion that a refusal of this association
to afford all newspapers equal privileges
makes it a trust, in plain violation of the
Sherman anti-trust liiw. There are large
numbers of Ohio papers which are not
receiving service, and, while it is not
known they would avail themselves of
it, an effort is to be made to secure the
passage of this bill, so that they can do
so if they desire service. Many members
of the Assembly, in interviews with The
Call correspondent, gave it as their opin
ion that the Associated Press comes
clearly within the delinition of what con
stitutes a trust and express themselves
as in favor of the passage of the Dodge
bill.

Present Reg\jlationa That Are a Great
Hardship to Many of tho Gold
Seekers.
Copyright, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
OTTAWA, Ont., Feb. 15.âRepresent
ative James Hamilton Lewis of Wash
ington had a conference on Yukon
matters to-day with Sir Wilfred Lau
rier and the Minister of the Interior.
Speaking of his mission, Mr. Lewis
said: "The object of my present visit
to Ottawa is connected with the diffi
culty which has arisen over certain
regulations compelling all miners to
take out mining licenses personally at
Victoria, Vancouver or other Canadian
ports. This works a very great hard
ship upon all American citizens who
may be going to the Klondike. I con
sulted with the Departments of State
and the Treasury, calling attention to
my proposal that we should ask Can
ada to permit the issue of free miners'
certificates by any British Consul or
Vice-Consul in the United States, or
at any rate at such ports In Alaska
as might be designated by the Domin
ion. Since arriving here the Chamber
of Commerce of Seattle, my home city,
has suggested Tagish as a convenient
point where license might be Issued. I
realize that Tagish is one of the points
in the disputed territory. This Is the
proposition that I have to submit to the
Canadian Government. I have every
confidence that our request will be
granted." ___^^__^_^^_

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15.â "Indian
Pete" Garcia, the alleged murderer of
Charles Collins, near Santa Monica, has
made a confession in which he asserts
that the woman who has passed as
his wife killed Collins. The confession
was made by Garcia at the County Jail
to-day, in the presence of Sheriff Burr
and Chief Jailer Kennedy.
The story Garcia tells is plausible,
but it must be remembered that if
Garcia can establish its truth it saves
his worthless neck. Ever since Garcia's
arrest an effort has been made to pre
vail upon him to tell the story of the
crime, but until to-day his lips have
been sealed. He has now unbosomed
himself and insists that the woman
who calls herself Mrs. Garcia commit
ted the deed.
Garcia claims that last Friday night
Collins came to the shack where Garcia
was living with the woman and that
all three proceeded to get drunk. They
drank a gallon of red wine and were
soon reduced to a state of lunacy. They
sang and caroused for some time, and
finally old man Collins, in his drunken
way, began to make love to the woman,
who was the most intoxicated one of
the three. Garcia did not object, and
the woman and Collins had a long con
versation. In the meantime Garcia
improved the shining Ijours by con
suming more than his share of the red
wine.
At length the woman and Collins told
Garcia they intended to go away and
remain for the evening. Garcia claims
that they departed and that in a short
time the woman came back alone, with
an ax upon her shoulder, remarking
that she had "done the old man up."
Garcia says the woman then took the
ax and washed the blood and hair
from the steel. After she had done
this she passed him a gold piece, say
ing:
"Here is twenty for you."
At the same time she rattled some
more money in her pocket, saying:
"The old man had a lot."
Garcia admits that he then went
with the woman to Collins' body with
the Intention of burying it. It lay In
a great pool of blood on the sand
dunes. The corpse was badly multi
lated, and in trying to arrange it so
that he could cover it with sand Gar
cia says that he got spattered with
blood. The burying of the corpse of
the murdered man proved to be too
difficult, so they finally returned to
their shack and left it lying on the
sands, where it was found the next
day.
Garcia was arrested while spending
the dead man's money. The woman
was present while Garcia was relating
this tale to the officers, and, consider
ing the nature of the revelations that
were being unfolded, she took re
markably little interest In it. When
"Indian Pete," as Garcia is known, had
concluded his story she arose from
her chair and said:
"It Is all a lie. Pete and Collins and j
me were all together that night drink- |
ing. Collins went away and Pete and i
me went to bed. That's all there is Ur !
it. I don't know who killed the old [
man. I didn't."
All efforts to prevail upon the
woman to confess availed nothing. She
refused to accuse Garcia of the crime
and as resolutely denied knowing any- |
thing about it herself. In several par- i
ticulars she denied the story of Garcia.
She said that they had other drink
besides the gallon of red wine.
The officers are inclined to believe
that the confession of Garcia is the
truth. Sheriff Burr is of the opinion
that the woman committed the actual
crime, but that Garcia assisted her in
planning It and In carrying the plan
into execution.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Feb. 15.
The executive session of the Senate
to-day was enlivened by a vigorous ef
fort of Senator Tillman of South Caro
| lina to secure recognition to make a
I point against the contention that the
Hawaiian Islands were of strategic
importance to the United States. Sen
ator Gallinger occupied the chair, and
I other Senators were seeking to make
l reports upon nominations, several com
! ing in after Tillman had risen. His
voice was drowned by theirs, and it
! began to look as if the Senate might
j adjourn without his being heard. Ap
parently realizing the situation the
South Carolina Senator took his posi
tion in the middle aisle, directly in
front of the chair, and demanded to be
heard.
"I have stood here on my feet while
eight or ten men have been recog
nized," said Senator Tillman, "and I
want to know if I am to be heard."
"If the Senator would speak a little
louder." said Senator Hoar, facetiously,
"he might be."
At this point Senator Gallinger, who
occupied the chair, rapped for order.
He then explained that the failure to
recognize Tillman was due entirely to
an inadvertence and to the fact that
his attention had been directed in an
other way. To this Tillman replied that
this explanation was entirely satisfac
tory, and he then proceeded to make
his point, which was that the strategic
importance of the Hawaiian Islands
was overrated. He argued that in case
of war between Japan and the United
States Japan could bring coal for her
warships over in tenders and thus ren
der herself entirely independent of the
islands.

sor of other jewels that are priceless. A
womanly woman knows this and would sac-
rifice all the diamonds of all the nations for
the clinging, confiding touch of baby hands.
Thousands of women lead childless, love-
less lives because of ill-health. They do not
understand the duties that they owe to them-
selves. They neglect the most delicate and
important parts of woman's organism. They
suffer untold agonies from weakness and dis-
ease of the organs that make motherhood
possible, and never know the thrilling touch
of baby fingers. They imagine their cases
hopeless.
In this they are mistaken. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription is a sure, safe, swift
cure for all weakness and disease of the or-
gans distinctly feminine. It acts directly
and only on these organs. It prepares a
woman for motherhood. It allays all dis-
comfort during the expectant period. It
insures the baby's health and makes its
coming easy and almost painless. More
than 90,000 women have testified in writing
to its value. All good druggists sell it.
Mrs. Rebecca Gardner, of Grafton, York Co.,
Va., writes: "I was so sick with dyspepsia that I
could not cat anything for over four months. I
had to starve myself, as nothing would stay on my
stomach. I tried almost everything that people
would tell me about, and nothing did me any
good. I weighed only 80 pounds. I took two bot-
tles of the ' Golden Medical Discovery ' and,
thank God, and your medicine, I am as well as I
ever was, and now weigh 125 pounds.- I hare a
bottle of your ' Favorite Prescription ' now, and
that is a wondef'il medicine for female weakness.
Praise God thai he created such a man as yon."

ESIERHAZY'S
SLURS ON THE
FRENCH ARMY
Wrote That General
Saussier Was a
Clown.
And That Prussians Could
Defeat His Soldiers
With Whips.
Testimony of an Expert Causes
a Sensation at the Trial
of Zola.
CELEBRATED BORDERAU.
!t Is Shown Conclusively That the
Note Wa6 Written by the Re
tired Count-Major.
PARIS, Feb. 15.â M. Millevoye
speaking to-night at a patriot
meeting at Suresnes claimed to
know that the secret document
upon which Dreyfus was con
demned read thus:
"Let them ask that canaille
Dreyfus what he has prom
ised us. GUILLAUME."
M. Millevoye added: "It is
evident that war might follow
the publication of such a docu
ment."
PARIS, Feb. 13.â The arrival of M.
Zola. It Perrieux and others at the j
Assizes Court of the Seine to-day was j
not marked by any incident. The i
crowd present Avas not so large as that
of yesterday. Opinions as to the issue
of the trial differ very greatly. While
some people are already discussing the
extent of the sentences others regard â 
the acquittal of the defendants as cer- I
tain, as it is evident the court is be
coming more favorably disposed
toward M. Zola.
The presiding Judge to-day dis
allowed the request of counsel for M.
Zola that the experts heard at the Es
terhazy court martial should be called
to testify.
M. Clemenceau, counsel for the Au
rore, read letters from Mme. de Bou
lancey, admitting the possession of let- ;
ters which Major Esterhazy wrote her '
between ISBI and 1894, and containing
serious animadversions on France and
the French army.
M. Clemenceau urged the court to ap
point a magistrate to ask Mme. de
I'.oulancey if among the letters there
was not one containing the expres
sions: Firstly, General Saussier (then
the commander-in-chief of the French
army and military governor of Paris)
is a clown. In our country the Ger
mans would not show him in a circus.
( t'proar in court.) Secondly, If the
Prussians got as far as Lyons they
might throw away their guns and keep
only their riding whips to drive the
French in front of them (fiolonged
sensation.)
Three amateur experts in handwrit
ing testified that the fac-simile was an
exact reproduction of Major Ester
hazy's handwriting, a statement which
caused a further sensation in court.
M. Felix Frank, a lawyer of Brussels,
testified that in order to demonstrate
his evidence it would be necessary to
have a blackboard and that it would
require an hour to demonstrate his
theory.
Amid an uproar in court the session
was suspended while a blackboard was
procured and placed on an easel, after
which M. Frank traced on the black
board a fac-simile of the bordereau and
of Major Esterhazy's handwriting, and
commenced his demonstration.
M. Frank made some long technical
demonstrations and said: "The ma
jority of the experts started on the
false idea that the writer of the bor
dereau had disguised his handwriting.
The bordereau, however, was written
naturally and in a running hand which
is identical with that of Major Ester
hazy. The latter (Major Esterhazy),"
continued the witness, "had recognized
the bordereau as being his own hand
writing, but had declared it had been
trflced by a forger."
M. Frank proceeded to technically
demonstrate the improbabiliay of this
explanation, showing how recurring
words presented certain divergencies.
The lengthy demonstration of the
witness caused some impatience among
the public in court culminating in open
murmurs wh^n M. Frank affirmed that
the bordereau was written by one per
eon alone and added that this person
was Major Esterhazy.
Annoyed at the murmurs. M. Frank
turned and cried: "I intended to end
here; but since I atn interrupted I will
continue."
The presiding judge here remarked:
"I will ask you to use different lan
guage than that which is discourte
ous.*
M. Lrftborie thereupon intervened,
asking the presiding judge to order si
lence in the court, pointing out that
ihe lawyers were following the evi
dence with the closest attention.
"I am convinced," M. Frank resumed,
"that the writer of the Bordereau has a
Gorman mind." The witness con
cluded by predicting that some day it
would be recognized that the bordereau
was not written by Dreyfus, which re
mark was greeted with murmurs.
The blackboard was then removed
and Professor Grlmand of the Poly
technic school deposed that he signed
the protests against the conduct of the
DrejrfÃfl affair because he was con
vinced that respect for the law, honor
and the fatherland was involved. The
whole procedure struck this witness as
being extraordinary. He added: "In
spite of the disguised threats and acts
â of intimidation of which I have been
the victim, I here affirm that a revi
sion of the case is a crying necessity,
and I intend to do my utmost to ob
tain it."
The witness concluded with assert
ing his rights as a patriot and his love
for the army, which brought forth
hearty applause.
Professor Havert of the College of
France said he examined, as an expert,
the bordereau and the letters of Major
TSsterhazy and Dreyfus, as well as a
letter written by Dreyfus since his con
demnation. The latter, the witness con
tinued, was devoid of resemblance to
the bordereau, of which he was con
vinced Major Esterhazy was the au
thor.
The court was then adjourned. The
"i-owd made no demonstrations.
WATCHER AT A SICK
MAN'S BEDSIDE HELD
UP BY A BURGLAR
Masked and Armed Robber Enters and Loots
the Dwelling of a Dying Mer
chant at Shasta.
REDDING, Feb. 15.â A burglar effected an entrance to the residence
of Mrs. George Knox at Shasta at an early hour this morning. Mrs.
Knox wns a%vakened by unueual noises and called to her aon Jo, who
was asleep In another room. The intruder was heard to beat a hasty
retreat.
The burglar next visited the house of Mrs. Melsin. He made a bun
gling attempt to get In, but was frightened away by the screams of
the woman.
At the residence of William McKeag the burglar effected an en
trance. McKeag, a prominent merchant and a pioneer citizen, was
sick abed and not expected to live. William Murray, a well-known
citizen, was watching at the bedside. Tfce burglar, his features hid
den by a mask, boldly entered the room and at the point of a pistol
relieved Murray of what money he had on his person. He then made
a thorough search of the house for valuables and made his es
cape by way of the back door.
The burglar was evidently not satisfied with the result of his night's
work, for he broke into the dwelling occupied by Mrs. Lltsch, notwith
standing the fact that a daughter was sick and a light was kept
burning all night on that account. The burglar ransacked the house.
C. J. Litsch, a son and prominent storekeeper, was awakened and the
intruder was frightened away, escaping by a rear door and passing out
through the yard. The identity of the robber is not known.

weeks, were issued to-day. They seek j

The Democratic address Is a fair
sample of the style of the others. It
: says in part:
The surrender of the Republican party

ent Administration, called to power on
the solemn pledge of the Republican na
tional convention at St. Louis to promote
bimetallism, has formulated and sent to
Congress a bill, the leading purpose of
which the honorable Secretary of the
! Treasury avows, is to commit the country
more thoroughly to the gold standard.
! The country has already, for twenty-four
years been so thoroughly committed to
! this standard, partly by law and partly
by the usurpations of the executive
branch of the government, that its ef
fects are seen and felt on every nana;
wages are reduced; work is harder to get;
the weight of debt is doubled; the value
i of land and other property Is reduced one
! half or more, until the lives of the people
are "made bitter with hard bondage.' It
! is certainly not in the Interest of human
ity to have this condition of things more
thoroughly established.
The continued rise in value of gold, or,
which is the same thing, the continued
fnll in prices, must inevitably transfer
the property of all those engaged in ac
tive business, the actual creators of
wealth, whether by hand, brain or capital,
to those who, avoiding tho risk and effort
i of active business, only draw interest.

TACOMA, Feb. 15.â Judge Hanford In
the United States Court to-day rendered
an important decision bearing upon the
admission into this country of the wives
and children of Chinese merchants, as
follQWs:
"In view of the statutes enacted by
Congress and of the decisions of the Su

cide the question as to the right of any
alien to enter the United States is con
ferred upon administrative officers; that
an alien whoso right to come in has been
denied by an inspector of immigration or
customs officer is not entitled to appeal to
the courts from such adverse decision,
and the courts have no ltcivful authority
to review the decision in a proceeding
upon a writ of habeas corpus, or in any
other way."

who arrived without a consular certificate

IMPROVEMENT
OF HARBORS
Hilborn Hopeful of Se
curing the Necessary-
Appropriations.
There Is Promise That Oakland
and This City Will Not
Be Neglected.
Probability of the Construction of
Two Needed Drydocks and
Another Battle-Ship.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 15.
Congressman Hiiborn is hopeful that
the sundry civil appropriation bill
will carry a large appropriation for the
improvement of Oakland harbor. He
said to The Call correspondent to
night:
"The limit of cost recommended by
the War Department engineers approx
imated $700,000, and I am pretty sure
the sundry civil bill will appropriate
one-fourth of this amount to be ex
pended during the next year. This will
be good news for our people. As far as
the tidal canal is concerned, I do not
know what the committee will recom
mend, but am hopeful that this pro
ject will be provided for. I am prom
ised by a member of the committee that
he will look after this matter, and am
hopeful that it will be included in the
bill.
"I do not know whether an appropri
ation will be made for clearing San
Francisco harbor of obstructions. I do
not see how an appropriation for blow
ing out these rocks could be put into
the sundry civil bill, which only car
ries appropriations for contracts al
ready entered into, but if a river and
harbor bill is passed^ it will undoubted
ly carry an appropriation for removing
these rocks as the engineers have sub
mitted estimates of cost. I am doubt
ful whether any river and harbor bill
will be passed at this session, as Speak
er Reed is economically inclined, but
you may assure the San Francisco peo
ple that if the river and harbor bill
is passed Congressman Loud will see
to it that an appropriation is included
for removing the obstructions In San
Francisco harbor."
Concerning the naval appropriation
bill, Congressman Hilborn said: "I
think that at least two new dry docks
will be provided for, one at Boston and
another at Mare Island, and it may be
a third one will have to be included for
Algiers, Louisiana, in order to get the
Southern vote. These docks, if con
structed, will cost about one million
and a half each. It is by no means
settled that the docks will be con
structed, as Speaker Heed and other
leaders of the House are anxious to
save all the money they can, but we
are hopeful that at least two docks will
be constructed, one on the Atlantic and
the other on the Pacific Coast. I be
lieve there is a strong probability that
another battleship will be provided for,
and that it will be built on the Pacific
Coast. If so,' it will be constructed on
the lines of the Wisconsin. "

Never before has a community
been aroused to such a pitch
of determination and resentment
against corrupt ring methods as
is now the case among the people of
San Jose. This feeling, as already re
lated In these columns, has crystalliÂ«ed
in the organization of the New Char
ter Club. This body is not only the
representative of many of the foremost
residents of San Jose, but it also rep
resents a number of other organiza
tions, whose objects are the inaugura
tion and maintenance of such a regime
in municipal affairs as will make San
Jose's government a boast for the
State and for the nation.
It is claimed that the New Charter
Club, through its own membership and
that of the various bodies which are
working in co-operation with It, will
control not less than 3000 votes. As the
usual vote at a municipal election runs
short of 5000, the good government
movement is thus virtually assured of
victory in the April election.
It is the express purpose of the lead
ers in this matter to make the victory
so overwhelming, however, that the
gang of boodlers and corruptionists will
have absolutely nothing with which to
go into any future campaign. With
all Its candidates defeated, with no
patronage at its disposal, with no fa
vors to confer and with no power to
work out its revenges, the gang will
be deserted by the parasitical follow
ers that make up its strength, and the
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

members of the ring will be shunned
as were the lepers of old. Its power
will be effectively broken and forever
gone. The prestige of victory, abso
lute and complete, will be carried by
the representatives of the good-gov
ernment movement into the fall cam
paign, with the probable result that
the boss element will then be as
thoroughly eliminated from county
politics as It now promises to be from
city affairs.
There is no question as to the Intense
desire of the people at large to secure
an entirely new personnel in the offices
of the various city departments, but
two dangers still menace the success
that is now within the grasp of the bet
ter element. Individual ambitions may
create dissensions within the ranks of
the reformers, and the gang may by
the cunning and insidious methods
characteristic of the corrupt politician
befuddle and delude the voters so as to
split the strength of the good citizens
and taxpayers, and thus permit the
gang to elect one or more of its can
didates.
Every effort will of course be made by
the gangsters to stir up strife in the
meetings and during the discussions
held by the members of the New Char
ter Club. This will be attempted by
playing on the personal ambitions and
personal prejudices of the members.
The officers and members will have to
guard against this, and eternal vigil
ance and self-restraint will be the price
of harmony and success. Against the
other danger, that of having the good
government vote scattered, all those who
really have the welfare of the city at
heart can and will guard. There must
be no alleged good government can
didates in the field other than those
nominated by the New Charter Club.
All who run independently or on any
other ticket than that of the New Char
ter Club should be treated as members
or tools of the gang.
No pains will be spared by the nomi
nating committee of the club to place
before the people for their suffrages
only Bueh men as have proved their
worth and ability to fill the positions
for which they may be named. Their
work will be governed by the principle,
so frequently and highly lauded but
nevertheless persistently ignored, that
the office should seek the man.
As the matter now stands the nom
inating committee is to have the entire
city ticket ready to submit to the club
by the 24th inst. The club will prob
ably lose little time In approving the
work of its committee, and the ticket
will then be made public.
The question has been frequently
asked why the New Charter Club does
not bring a suit to oust the Council
and Mayor, instead of bringing man
damus and injunction proceedings
against them. More than one act has
been committed by them that would
make the foundation for such a suit.
It is argued that one proceeding to oust
will do the whole business, and prevent
a multiplicity of suits.
This question was answered to-day
by Judge J. R. Lewis, the chairman of
the legal committee, which has charge
of all prosecutions and legal proceed
ings on behalf of the club. Judge Lewi3
was formerly a resident of Seattle, at
a time when the people of that city
had to cope with not only a corrupt
municipal legislative body, but with a
harbor commission that was composed
of a parcel of boodlers, and has had
practical experience in these matters.
He occupied the bench for about eight
years In the State of Washington, but
has now retired from practice, having
come to reside in San Jose to enjoy life
for the rest of his years.
"I don't think anything can be
gained," he said, "by proceedings to
oust the members of the Common
Council. They would prove to be too
long winded and would amount to noth
ing, as the defendants would In all
probability take an appeal, should the
Superior Court decide against them,
just as did the Board of Supervisors
of San Francisco. The old gang
will not let go while there is any
plunder in sight. It will stay in as
long as possible. These proceedings in
the way of mandamus and injunction
will accomplish more effectively and
promptly the object we seekâ to put a
stop to the looting of the city treasury.
"My idea is that these writs of man
damus and injunction are ample to
meet the situation without resorting to
proceedings to oust. If the latter were
brought they would be able to protract
them until after their terms expired,
and so nothing would in reality be ac
complished. Our plan is to bring one
or the other of these writs that have
already been invoked, and thus keep
the Council in check."
Councilman Nolting is tired of his
position as Councilman to the point of
being willing to resign. He so ex
pressed himself. He remarked that if
the other members and Mayor Koch
would agree to follow his example he
would at once vacate his office.
VICIOUSLY ATTACKED BY
AN ANGRY HUSBAND.
Case of Mistaken Identity Disastrous
to a Pasadena Young
Couple.
PASADENA, Feb. 15.â Barton H. Orr
and Miss Annie Basore were walking
north on Lincoln avenue, about in front
of the Lincoln achool, when a man came
up from behind. Baying:
"I'll learn you to be running with my
wife."
He instantly struck Orr senseless with
a club, and then attacked the girl, who
threw up her hand and received a severe
skull blow and had two finger bones brok
en. She ran half senseless Into a near-by
yard and wandered aimlessly about. A
passing cyclist found Orr and notified the
police. In the meantime Orr recovered
consciousness and took the girl home.
It is presumed that the unknown assail
ant mistook the woman for his wife and
Orr for her lover. Both Orr and Mies Ba
sore Will recover.

W. D. Conniff Tells How Old
Piles Were Resold to the
Harbor Commissioners.
Hundreds of Timbers Not Up to the Stan=
dard Sizes Disposed Of to the
State.
P. F. Pundon. who is the "Co." of
the lumber firm of Darby Laydon &
Co., was the first witness on the stand
in the case of the Paraffine Paint Co.
against the Board of Harbor Com
missioners when the court opened yes
terday. He had with him the books
of the firm, as well as his smile, which
has attracted so much attention dur
ing the progress of the case.
Before the day was ended the wit- i
ness became seriously foundered with
the former and had to abandon the lat-
Dre the session was over the
se was badly jarred by some of
t!-..- tpstimony given voluntarily and
under pressure.
Several items of no small importance
werp brought out. The first was on
the evidence of William D. Conniff, for
; - an employee of Darby Laydon <t
Co.. which bears out the statement
made in The Call yesterday, that hun- |
dreds of piles smaller than the stan- â 
dard sizes had been used by the Com
missioners in the repairing of the
wharves. The second item was forced
from Pundon when he was compelled
tn tell the c< art why the names "Bat
terson," "Matterson" and "Ratterson"
Inserted in the firm's books in
stead of the name of Patterson, the
superintendent of construction for
the Hi rbor â¢ '"ininission, to whom the
entries referred. In doing so, and much ,
against his will, he was obliged to
state that his partner, Laydon, had
private transactions with Patterson.
While much of the testimony of Dun
don \> given Commissioner Col- I
rK'ii sat, "r rather reclined behind At
â â  Stratton with his bead tipped
bai"-k on his < hair, apparently taking
but little interest in the proceedings.
This was apparent by the many ill
yawns and the half-closed
eyes. When the second witness, Wil
liam D. Conniff. took the stand Com
liflssioner Colnon assumed an upright
petition, and while Conniff was testi
fying the official manifested the keen- i
est interest. This witness stated that '
by occupation he is a raftsman and !
that he lives at 776 Howard street. For
the past seven years he has been in ,
the employ of the Darby Laydon con
cern ancl more recently he has been at
work fof Healy, Tibbets & Co. After
bringing out the fact that Conniff
used to deliver piles from his employer \
to tfie Harbor Commissioners, Attor
hey Cope asked: "What instructions
did you receive from the firm of Dar
by Laydon & Co. relative to the do
livery of piles to the Harbor Commis
sioners."
Attorney Stratton, for the State offi
cers, was on his feet in a second and
fired off a bunch of objections a yard
long. It was very evident from" the
attitude of the plaintiff's attorneys
that they expected to introduce evi
dence substantiating the statement
of The Call that the contractors have
been furnishing- the State with piles
not up to the standard of measure
ment. The attorney for the com
mission evidently intended to shut out
this evidence if possible. The judge
decided to let the testimony in and
Conniff made a long statement in
which he said that for years he had
measured and' delivered to the com
mission piles not up to the require
ments. For instance he and the fore
man of the State pile driver would
measure the timbers and allow for
more than the actual lengths.
"To what extent did such measure
ments exceed the actual lengths of the
piles?" asked Attorney Cope.
"From two to three feet on a pile,"
answered the witness. "I think that
the company knew all about it. for
they seemed to be pretty well satisfied
with the measurements. He (evident
ly referring to Laydon) told me to
measure thf> piles in good shape and
get all that I could out of it. I turned
thr> figures in on regular printed
blanks. My figures were in lead pen
cil." Conniff said that these transac
tions took place within the past three
years.
rv.rmiff testified that some time ago
a lot of old piles were pulled up at
Fisherman's Wharf, and these he took
around to Darby Laydon & Co.'s
yards, or log "boom" at North Beach.
Thf>se old piles were trimmed up. he
said, and sold to the Stato again. This
was done under the direction of Darby
Laydon & Co.. who gave the orders
to have the old piles towed to North
Beach, cleaned and towed back to the
Or e p-i- street wharf, where the State
pile-driver drove them again. Conniff
explained that the old piles were not all
delivered to the State at once, but a
few at a time. In every raft of twenty
flve piles from four to six of the old
ones were worked in.
The attorney next called the atten
tion of the witness to a lot of spruce
piles that some time ago had been sold
to the Commissioners. The witness
explained that spruce timber is of no
account for piles. It is soft and decays
easily, while as a rule it is full of
knots and too slim for wharf uses.
Wharf builders do not like it and do
not use it.
Then arose the matter of the size of
the piles delivered to the Pan Fran
cisco Timber Preserving Company's
works for creosoting. and Attorney
Stmtton madp more objections, but to
no purpose, and Conniff stated that the
larger part <>f the piles delivered were
small, averaging from ten to twelve
inches at the butt. On the front they
are called "pipe stems."
The early proceedings were opened
by Witness Dundon producing the
agreement of the San Francisco Tim
ber Preserving Company with Curtis
& Isaacs relative to the use of the pat
ent chemical preparations for the piles.
This was dropped, and the books of the
firm of Darby Laydon & Co. were
taken up, and the evidence of the wit
ness showed that the affairs of that
concern, the Timber Preserving Com
pany and the Slade Lumber Company
were so closely interwoven as to make
their divorce impossible.
In the books there were erasures, er
roneous entries, etc., that only the wit
ness could understand. There was one
item showing a difference of $400 in a
footing, and two others that referred
to the payment of nearly Â«500 to the
members of the Pile-drivers' Associa
tion, of which Dundon is the treasurer;
but why these latter sums should ap
pear in the hooks of the firm the wit
ness did not attempt to explain, and
protested against doing so on the
ground that the affairs of the P. D. A.
should not be forced from him. Then
came some very pointed questions by
Attorney Cope as to what appeared to
be erasures and changes and for what
purposes certain sums of money were
paid out. Dundon failed to remember
and he was excused until he could re
lresh his memory. Late in the after
noon he was again placed on the stand,
and by the time he got through his ac
customed smile was not visible.
The witness' explanations failed to
explain to the satisfaction of theParaf
fine Company's attorneys, while the
books showed a most strange system
of keeping accounts. Dundon's reason
for the insertion of the names of '"Mat
terson." "Hatterson" and "Ratterson,"
that attracted much interest, seemed
to be of questionable merit. He said
that the former bookkeeper for Darby
Laydon & Co.. Townley by name, got
into business for himself and left the
firm's books in a bad way. Later on.
after Townley failed, he asked for his
former position, and his request was
refused. This angered Townley, who
threatened to expose "that Patterson
matter." It was this that induced
Dundon to have the present bookkeeper
change the entries of Patterson on the
books to the names ending in "atter
son" that have caused so much com
ment.
Dundon was closely questioned as to
what these dealings between Patterson
and Laydon consisted of, but he re
fused to answer, saying that they were
private matters between these two
men named. The court and the specta
tors were left to surmise what could
be the secret transactions between the
head of the Darby Laydon Company
and the former superintendent of con
f'-uction for the Harbor Commission

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY IC, 1898.
LATEST ADDITION TO THE KLONDIKE FLEET.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's Steamer Valencia Arrived From Baltimore Yesterday. Accommodations for About
500 Passengers Will Be Put in, and as Soon as Those Alterations Shall Have Been Completed She Will Go On
the Copper River-Juneau-Dyea-Skaguay Route.
WILL CARRY
GOLD MINERS
Arrival of the Steel Steam
ship Valencia From
Baltimore.
When the Alterations Are
Made She Will Go on the
Dyea-Skaguay Run.
The Morgan City, Now Due, Had 168
Staterooms Put In Before Leav
ing the East.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Com
pany's new steamer Valencia arrived
in port from Baltimore yesterday. She
brought out a cargo of coal, which will
be discharged into Rosenfeld's bunkers.
after which she will be fitted out as a
passenger boat for the Dyea-Skaguay
route.
The Valencia came out in command
of Captain James Lord, making the
passage in 55V 2 days. The run from
the Straits of Magellan was made in
twenty-four days, and Captain Lord
said he could have easily reduced that
time by at least one hundred hours had
it not been for the continual fog which
was met with on the way up the coast.
Before leaving Baltimore Captain Lord
wrote to the owners of the vessel here
that he would arrive in San Francisco
February 15. He kept his promise to
the hour, as at 4 p. m. tho Valencia was
alongside the Mission-street wharf
ready to begin discharging.
The Valencia is a fine steel steamer
of 1197.56 net burden. She was built in
Philadelphia in 1882, is 252.7 feet long,
34 feet broad and 19.7 feet deep. She
has a nominal horse power of 900 and
can make about thirteen knots an hour.
The Valencia is not unlike the Maripo
sa and Alameda, and when fitted out
she will have accommodations for
about 500 passengers. Alterations will
be commenced as soon as her coal is
out, and she will be got ready as quick
ly as possible for the run between San
Francisco, Copper River, Juneau, Dyea
and Skaguay.
The British ships Glenogil and Ben
Lee are going to try conclusions during
the run from here to Cork. The Glen
ogil has a cargo of 79,347 centals of
wheat, valued at $115,938, while the Ben
Lee carries 85,775 centals of wheat,
valued at $121,000. The Glenogil got
away yesterday and the Ben Lee will
leave with this morning's tide. Consid
erable betting has been done on the
race, the Ben Lee being the favorite.
A great number of people bound for
the Klondike via Dyea and Skaguay
are going to send their provisions by
the all-water route. They will take
along with them just enough provisions
to last them until the river opens, and
everything else they will send to St.
Michael for transhipment on the river
steamers. In order to avoid any com
plications with the Canadian customs
authorities the miners are taking their
freight contracts, invoices and receipts
to the British consulate where the mat
ter is looked into and the papers vised
All the owners will have to do, there
fore, is to present these receipts to the
Canadian authorities when the river
boats arrive at Dawson City, and take
possession of their goods.
The steamer Whitelaw was to have
got away for Dyea and Skaguay yes
terday, but owing to the fact that the
alterations were not completed she will
not get away till to-day.
The steamer Morgan City, now due
here from the East, will be ready to
go into the Klondike trade a few days
after her arrival. Before she sailed for
this coast she was built up and 168
staterooms added to her, besides ac
commodations for many more passen
gers in the 'tween decks. The stars,
the emblem of the old Morgan line have
been painted off the smoke stack and
a shield bearing a miner's pick and
shovel, the emblem of the new com
pany, has been placed in their stead.
The British bark Helen Denny made
a long run to San Francisco of seventy
five days from Newcastle, N. S. W.
From the time she left Australia the
old vessel never had a chance, as noth
ing but light and variable winds were
encountered during the passage.
The steamer Australia will not get
away for the sound to-morrow, as at
first expected. The alterations cannot
be completed in time, so she will sail
next Monday at 4 p. m.
Headache Quickly Cured.

HART NORTH INSTALLED.
The Assemblyman From Alameda
Assumes the Duties of Immi
gration Commissioner.
Hart North, Assemblyman from Ala
meda County, and recently appointed
Commissioner of Immigration, took pos
session of the office yesterday afternoon.
He was cordially received by Walter P.
Stradley, the outgoing Commissioner, and
Inspectors Schell and Jeffeney, who
turned over the accounts and effects of
the office x<> him.
Mr. Stradley intends following the prac
tice of the law in this city with an in
cidental excursion into politics. He was
appointed fmir years ago last October.
It is not expected that any change will
be made in the Inspectors, they being un
der civil service.
Assemblyman North made a good re
cord at the last session of the Legisla
ture.
WILL FITZSIMMONS
BREAK HIS WORD?
The Champion Offered Tempt
ing Inducements to Fight
Corbett Again.
His Friends Are Sanguine That the
Cornishman Will Refuse the
Offer.
Jim Corbett, the scientific boxer, and
Bob Fitzsimmons, the champion punch
er, may meet again in the Sagebrush
State, to battle for the veriscope cham
pionship, t
Dan Stuart, "the man of fine hand
and large head," who failed to make a
barrel of money from the pictures
taken of the fight on March 17, last. Is
anxious for another trial, believing that
the improvements recently made in in
stantaneous photography will result in
successful shots of the fighters being
taken, in case they meet again.
Of course, Mr. Stuart, for reasons
best known to himself, does not wish
to figure as one of the interested par
ties now making arrangements for a
second meeting of the pugilists In the
city of Carson.
According to recent developments
Joe Harvey, a well-known turfite of
this city, has been appointed director
general of the proposed battle between
champion Bob and boxer Jim, which
is to take place in July next at some
point west of the Missouri River.
It is said that a purse of $50,000 has
been offered to Corbett and Fitzsim
mons, and that the offer was made by
a syndicate of sporting men represented
by Mr. Harvey. The conditions are
that the fighters can divide the purse
as they please, but so far as a per
centage of the privileges is concerned
they will have no voice in the matter.
The whole thing has all the earmarks
of a big money-making scheme.

BOTH ROBBERS
WORE MASKS
The Detectives Searching
for Two Desperate
Men.
Held Up William Beckman's
Grocery-Store on Bryant
Street.
Emptied the Cash Drawer and Got
Away With a Bottle of
Liquor.
Captain Spillane and his men are
anxious to secure the two robbers who,
at the point of revolvers, held up the
clerk in William Beckman's grocery
store at Sixth and Bryant streets, last
Monday evening, and got away with a
bottle of gin and a small amount of
money. The clerk was conversing with
a customer named Reynolds, when the
men, who wore masks, entered the
store, and drawing their revolvers, or
dered them to throw up their hands
under penalty of being riddled with
bullets. Reynolds was made to turn
his face toward the wall while one of
the robbers searched the cash drawers,
securing about 30 cents. As he walked
from behind the counter he picked up
a bottle of gin, which he passed to the
confederate. After warning the aston
ished clerk not to make an outcry the
desperate robbers then left the store,
and immediately disappeared down
Bryant street. As soon as they were
out of sight the clerk ran outside and
lustily shouted for the police.
Officer O'Connor responded and on
being told of the daring robbery he at
once sent word to Captain Spillane.
The latter detailed several of his men
to hunt for the robbers, but up to a
late hour last night they had not suc
ceeded in obtaining a clew to their
identity. The clerk in the store seri
ously doubts whether he can identify
the men in case they are arrested. He
described one of them as being about
.35 years of age and wore a dark slouch
hat, which was pulled down over his
eyes.
The other, he thinks, -was much
younger. He also wore a slouch hat,
and was shabbily dressed.
The police are inclined to believe
that the robbers are the same men
who entered a grocery store in the
same vicinity several weeks ago, and
after holding up the proprietor and
several patrons purloined the contents
of the cash drawer.
One of the men was arrested, but as
his victims were unable to identify
him he was released.

Death of Arthur Q. Fletcher.
News was received in this city of the
death, at Los Angeles, of Arthur G.
Fletcher last Monday. For the past five
years Mr. Fletcher has been the clerk of
the Board of Fish Commissioners, and
was prominently connected with its
work being one of the best posted men
in the State upon its commercial fish
eries He was a young man of excep
tional ability and the strictest integrity,
and his death is a great loss to the com
mission and to a large circle of friends
throughout California. He was a Knight
Templar, and the funeral services will
be conducted by the commandery at Los
Angeles, after which the body will be
sent to his former home in Vermont.

CULTIVATING CRIME FOR PROFIT.
WHEN a few months ago there was an ap
palling murder committed in New York the
Journal of that city offered a reward for the
assassin's detection. The guilty were caught, yet,
strangely enough, the police take credit for this, and
a little investigation shows that they had presumed
to manifest an interest in the case, notwithstanding
yellow journalism had claimed it for its own. All
the police did was to follow clews, gather evidence,
arrest the criminals and assist in their prosecution.
Yellow journalism did the rest, this consisting in
howling a pean of praise to itself and offering a re
ward. There was no need of the offer; of course
the praise may be regarded as inevitable.
Now there has been another murder of a pecu
liarly shocking type, and the sheet has followed the
vicious precedent set by itself. The principle is
wrong, the act useless save for advertising purposes,
and the effect is certain to be harmful. If there are
to be extra rewards offered regularly for the detec
tion of crime, if reporters are to do detective work,
the salaries paid to the police might as well be saved.
Instead of trying to earn their lawful and adequate
salaries officers will learn to wait until the editor
has decided how much he can afford to pay.
The standing reward for the detection of a gory
criminal will produce the crime, and somebody will
be brought forward as the culprit. There are men
in every large city who would commit murder for a
small part of a thousand dollars and without hesi
tancy place fhe guilt upon an innocent person. It
is men of this class whom yellow journalism, with
its heralded rewards, is now trying to win from the
ranks of the unemployed. To do this, to undermine
the usefulness of regular peace officers, and to get
some cheap advertising are the objects sought, the
first two being merely incidental.
THE DOLLAR LIMIT.
THE Board of Freeholders, in the charter which
they propose to submit shortly, have adopted a
limit on municipal taxation in the following
form: "But such levy, exclusive of the State tax and
the tax to pa}' the interest and maintain the sinking
funds of the bonded indebtedness of the city and
county, shall not exceed the rate of $1 for each $100
valuation on the property assessed."
This clause is modeled after the taxation limits
adopted by the municipal conventions of fifteen or
eighteen years ago. Experience proved at that time
that the proposed limit was a limit at only one end.
The maximum rate is $1 on the hundred, but nothing
1$ said about the assessment roll. A rate of $1 on a '
$300,000,000 roll will, as may readily be seen, yield a ;
smaller sum in taxes than the same rate on a $400,- '
000,000 roll. All the tax eaters need do in order to
control this limit is to increase or decrease the as
sessment roll. The master of the limit will, there
fore, be the Assessor.
A genuine effort was made by the local politicians
in the early 'Bo's to ascertain the merits of the dollar
limit on taxation. Both parties adopted a pledge
embodying the limit now proposed by the Freehold
ers. The Republicans carried the city in 1879 and
again in 1881. Their Supervisors violated the pledge
in the first instance and kept it in the second, causing
in the latter year a deficit which stopped work on the
highways and sewers and extinguished the street
lights for several months. It was found in 1883 that
unless the assessment roll was made a subject of
pledge the cost of government could not be perma
nently reduced.
It was then that the practice of pledging Supervis
ors to levy a tax of $1 on an assessment roll of a
specified amount was invented. This solved the
problem completely and government would long ago
have been cheapened in San Francisco had boards
of Supervisors ever devoloped a disposition to com
ply with the spirit of their pledges. Their practice,
however, has been not to endeavor in good faith to
conduct the city on the amount allowed by the muni
cipal conventions, but to discredit taxation limits and
political pledges by loading the payrolls of the city
down with useless tax eaters and creating deficits
In this way they have hoped finally to force the tax
payers to abandon all idea of curtailing expenses.
If the Freeholders are going to adopt a limit on
taxation, therefore, it will be well for them to devote
some study to the history of the subject. The limit
they propose cannot be expected to enforce econ
omy. All the tax eaters need do in order to produce
the money necessary to give us extravagant govern
ment will be to swell the assessment roll. Perhaps no
limit which can be formed will exactly meet the re
quirements of the situation. But would it not be a
good idea to arbitrarily fix the maximum yearly ex
penses of the government and require the unanimous
concurrence of Mayor and Supervisors to set it
aside? This might give the taxpayers a chance to
control the tax eaters.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1898\
CELEBRATE OUR SEMI-CENTENNIAL.
CALIFORNIA was admitted into the Union
September 9, 1850. In 1000 she will celebrate
the fiftieth anniversary of her statehood. How
shall it be done?
To appreciate the achievements of that half century
1 one must reflect upon the conditions under which it
began. For a hundred years there had been here and
there on this soil a dreamy civilization. It had slept
and enjoyed its reveries in unknown contact with the
wonderful natural resources, now partly known and
partly developed. From clustering around the early
missions it had secured here and there a foothold in
our grassy valleys, where the lords of the great
grants lived as the Highland chiefs lived, in the
midst of their clans. Flocks and herds roamed at will
in the valleys, cropping their forage, sharing it with
the deer, elk and antelope, and sharing with them also
the risks from mountain lions and their predatory
partners. Beyond the ecclesiastical authority, seated
in the missions, there was no conspicuous attempt to
found institutions, and, in justice to those pioneers
of civilization, it must be admitted that their simple
lives gave but small occasion for the exercise of
governmental authority. California was but little
known to the outside world. Guarded by its moun
tain wall on the east and by the wide stretching
deserts of water on the west, its topography, physical
geography, its seasons and its soil and sky were the
subject of interesting speculation, as the vast reaches
of Africa are now, but there was less actual knowl
edge about them than the world of to-day has of the
Dark Continent. Fremont came as an explorer, and
though this generation cannot realize it, his own time
recognized in him all that civilization sees now in
Livingstone, Speke and Stanley. The simple story of
his trials, his passing of parched deserts and scaling
of lofty mountains; his nights in the somber forest on
guard against wild beasts and wilder men; his descent
upon the plains, all the marvels which he first
brought to the world's attention, appealed to the im-
agination and inspired romance. It was the first
achievement to excite the fancy and rouse the
spirit of adventure in the New World since the expe
ditions of Pizarro and Cortez. Followed closely by
the discovery of gold, the world's imagination, fired
by the adventures of the Pathfinder, was inflamed by
the vision of wealth. The pastoral civilization of the
country was swept from the valleys by the besom of
a crusade before which crumbled all that had been.
When the admission of California was put among
the compromises of 1850 in Mr. Clay's omnibus bill
this State was introduced upon the theater of national
politics. Though it was yielding gold, the knowledge
of its more permanent resources was so meager that
many things in the debates on Clay's measure seem
remarkable now. Webster's speech will always stand
as a monument to his genius. The ultra Southern
sentiment resisted the admission of California as a
free State because it would destroy the sectional bal
ance. Free and slave States had entered the Union
in pairs; Vermont and Kentucky in 1791-92; Tennes
see and Ohio 1796-1802; Louisiana and Indiana
1812-16; Mississippi and Illinois 1817-18; Alabama
and Maine 1819-20; then came the break in this or
der and the first compromise. Missouri and
Arkansas came in 1820-36, and the Mis
souri compromise line of 36 minutes 30
seconds was drawn, south of which all should be
slave and north all should be free. Between 1820 and
1546 four slave States came in and only one free. In
the next two years came two free States, and then
California knocked with the line of 36 minutes 30 sec
onds dividing her into two nearly equal parts. Begin
ning at about Cypress Point, on Monterey Bay, that
line crossed the San Joaquin Valley between Fresno
and Visalia, crossed Monnt Whitney and cut off the
northernmost sands of Death Valley. If those who
stood by the compromise of 1820 had prevailed, slav
ery and freedom would have met at that line.
The situation was portentous, and the solution
came in the speech of Webster. Turning to the Sen
ators of the slave States he told them they would
lose nothing. Slavery was an incident of physical
conditions. It had receded from New England and
the Middle States because in their climate it was un
profitable, and, like every system of labor, the essence
of its being was in its profit. Then, turning to Cali
fornia, he said it was, in its physical geography and
its topography, Asiatic. It differed in these respects
from the rest of the continent. Its products would
be found peculiar to itself, different from those of the
rest of our domain. Chattel slavery had never flour
ished in Asia for physical reasons, and, as Congress
could not repeal nor compromise a natural law, slav
ery, if founded in this Asiatic atmosphere, would per
ish and fade away.
Looking backward through the events and across
the development of two score years and eight, one
stands as enchanted in the presence of Webster,
struck with the universality of his knowledge and the
prophecy that was fh his analysis. The source of his
information has been a mystery to students. But it is
known that he gained it from a man who was by na
ture an empire builder and the keenest observer of
nature and her resources this coast and country have
known. Dr. Gwin was one of our first Senators. He
was in Washington from his election in 1849 to the
admission of the State in 1850. Born a slaveholder, a
participant in the exciting history of Jackson's ad
ministrations, he pioneered here and put his hand to
the foundations of California. From him Webster
had the accurate description of the physical condi
tions of California from which his genius developed
that generalization which has been proved in every
detail.
So, impinged upon history, this land emerged from
its past into statehood. Every step of the way is
written in romance and every advance is bowered in
beauty and spread with abundance.
When this became the first Pacific State it stood
alone. lowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas were the
frontier. We were the isolated star on the flag. Now
out of the vast region held by wild tribes, fortified by
mountain and desert, which lay in solendid solitude
between us and our sisters of the Union, and north
to the confines, ten States have been erected. We
are alone no more. The subject expands a 9 we con
template it. How shall all of its suggestions find em
phasis in the golden wedding anniversary of our
State? Let California invite her ten juniors here to
an exposition of her developments. We have had a
midwinter fair. Let us celebrate in 1900 with a mid
summer exposition our semi-centennial as a State of
this Union. Let us rebuild in Golden Gate Park the
first mission consecrated on this soil and in architec
ture, productions and institutional progress illustrate
each step we have taken in fifty years. The world's
eye is turned again to the Pacific Coast and the
world's hand reaches across all latitude and longitude
to grasp the newly found treasures of our north. In
such a semi-centennial exposition all lands will find'
interest. The clemency of our summer climate, our
cooling trade winds, our capacious cornucopia, filled
with our rare products, and our lintels bright with
blooming garlands will invite the world to enter a
fairy land and rest with us in the midst of beauties
and blandishments that the vale of Cashmere cannot
rival.
Known as New Albion, in the far past mapped as
the islands of California, fate has changed our flags
and sovereignty and led on to a destiny up to the full
measure of our natural endowment. Let us exploit
it all and justify our pride in our inheritance.
A FEARFUL DISASTER.
r\ FEARFUL story of disaster at sea, resulting,
/\ it is believed, in the loss of many lives, has
* * come down from Juneau â a terrible offset to
the former tales brought from that region of golden
fortunes found by lucky adventurers on the Klon
dike.
Few details have been received, and the full extent
and nature of the disaster are not accurately known.
Some residents of Seward City saw on the evening
of February 5 a small steamer trying to make her
way against a storm wind that was blowing head on
against her, far out in the channel. While they
watched the vessel broke out into flames. Human aid
was impossible. In the gale and the rough sea the ill
fated ship went down, and as far as is known none of
her crew or passengers survived.
The wrecked steamer is believed to have been the
Clara Nevada, which left Skaguay for Juneau and
Seattle on February 5 and has not since been heard
from. Fragments of wreck which strew the beach
along the coast where the disaster occurred are said
to be freshly painted, as the woodwork of the Clara
Nevada was known to be. From these facts the con
clusion is drawn that the wrecked ship was no other
than that steamer, and there seems to be little or no
hope that any person on board has lived to tell the
story of the disaster or explain how it occurred.
Danger always encompasses those who go down to
the sea in ships, but human skill and care have long
since reduced these to a minimum in all well con
ducted lines of ocean navigation. The dangers still
exist, however, in cases where the ships are ill
equipped, ill manned or ill fitted for stormy
voyages, and there is a fearful probability
that many vessels hastily prepared to reap
for their owners the profits of the rush to Alaska may
be of the unworthy class. The story of the wreck off
Seward comes as a warning to those who are about
to undertake that voyage, and will impress upon all
the importance of exercising great care in the selec
tion of a vessel on which they are to embark in their
search for fortune.
While no information is forthcoming on which to
base any charge of carelessness on the part of the
owners or the officers of the ill-fated ship whose
wreck was so sudden and so complete, there was
clearly something wrong somewhere. In the face of
the disaster and in the absence of definite information
concerning the cause of it, no one will venture to
impute blame to any particular person. The only
moral that can be drawn from the tragedy is the gen
eral one of warning to all who are going north to be
ware of ships hastily fitted out.
Fuller information which will be received later on
may show clearly where the blame of the disaster
rests, but in the meantime Government officials
should exercise the greatest care and scrutiny in
testing every vital portion of a ship destined for the
Alaskan trade. It is pretty well known that many
unseaworthy vessels of all classes have been hur
riedly fitted out at Seattle and other northern ports
for the rush to the gold fields, and parties taking pas
sage in ships from those places must exercise extra
care and caution.
REFORM IN SAN 4OSE.
THE battle for good government in San Jose
is being fought with a vigor of action and Â«
strategic skill that augur well for success at
the polls. The promoters of the movement and the
leaders in the contest are not relying for victory
solely upon popular enthusiasm or public sentiment.
They have organized their forces and made ready
the means for enthusiasm and sentiment to translate
themselves into action during the campaign and on
election day.
It is only by such means that any lasting success
can be accomplished for good government either in
that or any other city. Sporadic outbursts for re
form never have permanent effects, and not infre
quently do more harm than good. Old John Adams
was right. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
Men who are not willing to pay that price and keep
a ceaseless watch upon government will become vic
tims of some kind of tyranny sooner or later and
find themselves ruled by some ignoble little Caesar
in the form of a "municipal boss."
When the good citizens of New York had obtained
their new charter they indulged the fond belief
that all would be well thereafter whether they con
tinued to act together or not. The consequence of
trusting to this delusive phantom of hope, instead of
organizing for an unceasing campaign for good gov
ernment, was a victory for Tammany last fall which
has placed the boss in control of the city, with ifc>
extension, its new charter and everything else.
The San Joseans have been wise enough to profit
by the warning of the big metropolis. Having
adopted a new charter they have determined to have
it administered by its friends, and not by its foes.
The New Charter Club did not adjourn on the day
after the charter was adopted. On the contrary, it
perfected its organization, augmented its member
ship, maintained its resolution to provide good gov
ernment by the election of good men to office, and
now faces the spring election with a well-assured
confidence of victory.
As a rule The Call doe 9 not favor non-partisan
movements. They are generally ineffective, and not
infrequently are organized mainly by soreheads, who
have been disappointed in what they expected of
their parties. In this instance, however, there seems
no other way for the people of San Jose to achieve
the overthrow of the bosses. It has been long since
there was any genuine party politics in Santa Clara
County. The bosses and the push and pull of both
machines have stood together for the spoils, and the
people, so long as they remained divided, have been
powerless. Under such circumstances non-partisan
ship is a necessity. It is the only way to victory,
and fortunately it promises to be a sure way.
A TREASONABLE JOKE.
IN a speech to a body of recruits who
took the oath of allegiance last autumn
the German Emperor said that "only
good Christians could be good sol
diers." This remarkable statement was
much canvassed and criticized in Ger
many *.nd elsewhere, and the Kladdera
dafsch, the German Punch, published a
"PROM THE CAMP OF THE HEAVENLY HOST."
The Cartoon for the Publication of Which the Editor of the Kl&dderadatsch Has Been Sent
to Prison for Two Months by Kaiser William.
cartoon in which Satan was depicted aa
fetching from heaven Leonidas, Alexan
der, Napoleon and Frederick the Great,
and reminding them that they had >no
place there. This joke brought a prose
cution for lese-majeste down upon the
head of the unfortunate editor of the
Kladderadatsch, and on Tuesday last he
was duly convicted and sentenced to two
months' imprisonment in a fortress. The
prosecution laboriously pointed out that
his Majesty was speaking to the adher
ents of the Evangelical church in his dual
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The trials of cruiser Diadem of 11,000
tons are being watched with great inter
eat by navy people. She is one of a class
of seven vessels building for the British
navy and the interest centers in the out
come of the trials of the improved Belle
ville boilers with which she is fitted and
which differ somewhat in the number and
size of tubes from those of the Powerful
and Terrible. The ship underwent her
thirty hours' coal consumption trial un
der one-fifth power on January 21 and 22,
dining which she averaged 3315 horse
power, 12.74 knots and consumed 2.18
pounds of coal. The boilers, thirty in
number, have 40.550 square feet of heating
surface and 1460 square feet of grate, and
the steam carried was 2(55 pounds, against
175 pounds as the maximum carried in cy
lindrical boilers. The other vessels of the
same class and type are fitted with Scotch
boilers. The full power and natural
draught trials of the Diadem were to be
proceeded with at once.
A local naval reserve Is being projected
at Hongkong. There will, however, be
some difficulty In securing fighting ma
terial, but it Is proposed to obtain Chi
nese as firemen, their wages ranging per
month frÂ«m $14 with food to $18 without
food. There are. about 1200 Chinese em
ployed by British shipping on the coast of
China, and they are credited with being
excellent in that line.
English service journals express sur
prise that the United States, should build
a 16-lnch gun weighing 126 tons, and point
to the fact that such monster pieces have
been discarded in Europe. The American
gun Is Intended for coast defense and is
being made, probably, more to show that
our gunmakers can produce heavier guns
than Europe. It will be forty-nine feet
long, and with a charge of 1000 pounds of
powder will fire a 2000-pound projectile,
and each round fired will cost about
$2000. The eight 16-inch guns in the British
navy, weighing 106 tons, are to be re
placed In the near future with 12-inch
guns, which weigh only forty-five tons
and cost only about $250 to fire. The 10
inch gun is, as a matter of fact, preferred
to any other, and in the German navy the
caliber is as low as 9.4 inches. In the
American navy the battle-ships now
building are intended to carry 13-lnch
guns, which will be the largest caliber
afloat of modern ordnance.
The engines of the Petropolawsk, RusÂ«
sian battle-chip, have been accepted, al
though they fell short 533 of the contract
horse-power of 10.C00. The full-power trial
was the severest yet exacted in any navy,
as it extended over twelve consecutive
hours and worked right through without
a hitch and gave a speed of nearly 18
knots. The Petropolawsk is of 10,960 tons,
with a 15.8-inoh armor belt, 3Vi-inch pro
tective dock and carries four 12-inch guns
in two 10-inch casemates and twelve 6
inch quick-firing guns, eight of which
are in small turrets and four on the main
deck in/ 3-inch casemates. The ship has
also six torpedo tubes.
Brazil has transferred its contracts in
England and France for two armored
vessels and three cruisers to a foreign
government, presumably Japan. The low
state of Brazilian finances is assigned as
a reason for abandoning for the present
the projected navy increase.
The Hal-chi, a cruiser of 4300 tons, built
for China, was launched from the yard of
the Armstrong Company, Elswick, Janu

beam and is guaranteed to make a speed
of 24 knots.

Much worse than open language was

DOCTORED
VALENTINE.
Saturday last in a state of great ex
citement and in rapid accents said to him:
"Say, old man, my firm has ordered me to
catch the 4 o'clock train for Sacramento,
and I want you to do something for me.
You know Monday Is St. Valentine's day,
and I would like to send a valentine to a
young lady whom I had the extreme
pleasure of meeting lately. She's a peach,
my boy, and when I was coming down the
street just now wondering what I would
send to this female divinity. I saw a val
entine In a show window that just fits
her case exactly; It is the most appropri
ate thing you ever saw in your life, so I
bought it. Say, you ought to see my
latest conquest. I took her to dinner last
evening and I must confess that she is a
most extraordinary eater, for my bill was
an even $12, but that doesn't count with
me, and she is a top-notcher just the
same. Isn't that a lovely valentine? Now,
as I have to get that train, I want you
to send !t to her for me. Her name is
Rose G., and her address 324 M. street.
Just look at the pretty verse Inscribed on
It," and voluble Charles read as follows;
A dainty, delicate creature ia Rose;
In her I've met my fate.
The hue of her bonny dimpled cheek
Is roseate.
"Good-bye, old boy, see that she gets it,
will you?" and with that he disappeared
to catch his train.
Now Charley did not know that when
he mentioned the young lady's name he
had awakened an unpleasant recollection j
in Harry's heart, for Rose had cruelly
jilted the latter some six months previous j
and he still suffered from the effects of !
the operation. He determined to carry
out a little scheme of revenge and at the ,
same time play even with the fickle Rose,
and he did so, for when she received the
valentine early on Monday morning the
following lines had been added by the â .

feelings of the young lady can be better ''

Klijah Brown, tha cobbler, was enamored oÂ«

Should trumpet to the universe the worthy

And, though his own weak pinions failed to
reach the heights of song.
His genius hatched a brilliant scheme to help
his oath along;
And all his little youngsters, as they numer

Haggled About a Broken Window
While His Store Was Being
Looted.
Four daring burglars made a success
ful raid on a grocery store kept by
Herman Schomaker at Gough and Oak
streets yesterday morning. Their plan
of robbery was original and they se
cured about $500 in cash, a check for
$40 and two postofflce orders for small
amounts.
The proprietor was alone In his store
shortly before noon when a young man
entered and asked for a cake of com
pressed yeast. He tendered a $10 gold
piece in payment and Schomaker went
to a desk guarded by a railing at the
farther end of the counter and pro
cured the change. A few minutes after
the customer left another young man
entered the barroom of the place and
called for a glass of beer.
It was served to him, and
as he stood at the bar drinking, and
while the storekeeper was busying him
self about the place, there came a. crash
of breaking glass at the front of the
store. A paint pot had been hurled
through the front window.
Schomaker rushed from behind the
counter of his store and out on the
sidewalk to see what the trouble was
and to find out who was to blame for I
the damage to his place. On the side- j
walk were two men apparently tight- '
ing. One of them wore the dress of a
painter and it was he who had thrown
the paint pot. He claimed the other
man had owed him 30 cents and he was
trying to collect it when a row oc
ourred. He tried to hit his debtor over
the head with the paint pot, but missed
him and smashed the window instead.
The two men made a further bluff at
quarreling and then commenced to dis
pute as to who should pay for the
broken glass. Finally the alleged debt
or agreed to pay for the window pro
vided the amount he owed to the paint
er should be considered as paid. To
that the painter agreed, and the man,
after groping in his pockets in an ap
parent search for a coin, said he did
not have any money with him, but he
would go home and get it and pay the
grocer for the broken glass. He started
off toward Fell street, and a moment :
later the man who had quarreled with
him followed.
The grocer went back into his store, j
The man who had been drinking the
beer when the window was broken was
gone. He had departed through a
side door. The grocer had occasion a
moment later to look into the desk :
and when he opened it a buckskin
sack in which he kept his money was
found to be missing. Then it dawned j
upon the grocer that the purchase of
the yeast cake by the stranger and
the beer drinker who came In soon |
afterward and the feigned fight in the
front of the store by which the win
dow was broken were all in a plan ar
ranged by the robbers to get his
moriey.
The man who purchased the yeast
cake and offered a ten-dollar gold
piece in payment went into the store
for the purpose of locating the place
grhere the gpxvr kept his money. The
large o>in was given in payment to
make the st'U'^keeper go to his cash
Bupply to get the change. The young
maii who entered the barroom and
ask"! for beer had been told the exact
place t" look for the sack that con
tained the grocer's money. While he
WM pippin c; his beer two- of his com
panions were to give him an opportun
ity to get to it and escape with the
money. They feigned the fight in the
front of the store. It was a part of the
plan of the burglars to break the win
dow and fo hold the attention of the
grocer while the man who purchased
the beer sneaked in behind the coun
ter to the desk and secured the sack of
coin.
They succeeded well. Schomaker
had forgotten all about the man he
had left in the bar of his place when
he went to see about the broken win
dow, and he did not think of him again
until he missed the money.
The man who sneaked behind the
counter and secured the sack of
coin was about 35 years of age as
well as Schomaker can remember his
customer. He had a slight mustache
and was about five feet nine inches
tall: The man who> was dressed as a
painter was about 30 years of age and
he wore a dark mustache. He had on
the usual white suit worn by members
of the painters' craft, with a dark
jacket over the white blouse. He was
about five feet seven inches tall. The
man he feigned to be quarreling with
was about 25 years of age and about

DISCRIMINATING DUTY.
Reciprocity to Be Made the Basis of
Action in All Cases Coming
Under the Rule.
The United States Board of General
Appraisers has rendered an important de
cision on questions arising under the pro
visions of section 22 of the act of July
24, 1837, relating to the imposition of a
discriminating duty of 10 per cent ad
valorem in certain cases.
The effect of this decision, in which the
Treasury Department concurs, taken in
conjunction with the opinion of the At
torney-General, is to relieve all merchan
dise coming from a contiguous foreign
country from the exaction of discriminat
ing duty, except such merchandise as
comes via contiguous foreign territory
from a country, the government of
which exacts a discriminating 1 duty upon
the vessels of the United States, or upon
the produce, manufacture or merchan
dise imported in the same from the
X'nited States or from any foreign coun
try.
Should any foreign merchandise become
legally liable to the discriminating duty
Erovicied for by section 22, clue notice will
c given by this department.
The decision now rendered being op
posed to the opinion given by fhe Solici
tor-General, as contained in the circular
of October 6. 1897, No. 163 (Synopsis 18427),
customs officers will no longer be gov
erned by the provisions of that circular.
All entries liquidate in accordance with
that circular will be reliquidated under
this decision, and duties paid in excess
as discriminating duties will be duly re
funded.
BOONE'S DISBARMENT.
He Makes Affidavit Accusing Repu
table Lawyers of Wrongdoing
Similar to His Own.
John L. Boone has filed an affidavit in
the United States Circuit Court with his
! petition for a rehearing in the dlsbnr
i ment proceedings against him, and in the
; affidavit he tries to make it appear that
I reputable lawyers have been guilty of
similar practices to those for which he
was disbarred.
He avers that in the case of Knox &
Osborn vs. the Great Western Quicksil
ver Company in the United States Circuit
Court in 1572, Hall McAllister accepted a
retainer from Knox & Osborn, got a ver
dict for them and afterward appeared
against them in another suit concerning
the same patent. Judge Boalt is also
charged by Boono with having appeared
against a former client in a patent case.
Hoone swears also that Judge D. J. Mur
phy appeared for Laura D. Fair on her
first trial and afterward, as prosecuting
attorney of the District Court, appeared
against her.
The charges have caused much indig

they deny that their cafes are at all sim

of detection. The men In charge openly
assert that they do not fear the police,
and defy them to obtain sufficient evi
dence against them. As far as the
police know three poolrooms for "ladies
only" are in full operation on Grant
avenue. The most frequented, perhaps,
Is situated in a building at the north
west corner of Grant avenue and Geary
street. Almost erery afternoon a crowd
of women can be seen tripping up the
stairs to the poolroom, anxious to bet
thpir last cent on some horse. "Billy"
Akers, a retired prixe-flghter. runs the
place, assisted by a man named Har
rington, who is known to the habitues
of the tenderloin as "Pretty Harry."
When a Call reporter visited the pool
room yesterday afternoon, Harrington
was seated at a small desk engaged in
the lucrative pastime of writing "tick
ets" for the deluded women who
thronged the place.
"Say, pard, have you anything good
to-day?" asked a dilapidated-looking
female, addressing Harrington. "I've
about reached the end of my string and
want a lead-pipe cinch."
The suave clerk assured hex; that he
had a "sure winner," and would "put
her next," as he expressed it.
Taking her purse from her dress
pocket she eagerly opened it and hand
ed Harrington 25 cents.
"Say. don't throw me down," she re
marked. "If the tip ain't right tell me.
I am up against it, and to lose the
quarter completely breaks me."
The clerk told her that the horse
could not possibly lose unless he met
with some accident.
"Well, it goes," she hesitatingly re
marked, as Bhe passed her last 25 cents
to the'clerk: "play it straight, and God
pity me if I lose."
After waiting a short time, during
which the unfortunate now eagerly
noted the hots made by her fellow
victims, word was sent that the horse
had come in last.
"This is awful," bemoaned the mis
guided woman. "Robbed of my last
cent by an unscrupulous tout."
With tears streaming down her face
the grief-striken woman sadly left
the mom and walked down stairs.
As she reached the sidewalk she
turned around as if to take a farewell
lock at the place ami then passed on
muttering, to herself. Similar sa;l
scenes were witnessed, all of which
were scarcely noticed by the hardened
clerk and the other attaches of the
pool room.
There Is another pool room for
"ladies only" at 36 121 2 Grant avenue.
The men who conduct it are known as
Kohen and Anderson. They do a large
business, notwithstanding that the
average bet does not exceed 50 cents.
In room 8 of the Carleton House, at
116 Grant avpnue, thfre is still another
pool room, which is patronized exclu
sively by women. Almost daily a
heterogeneous crowd of sportively In
clined women can be seen walking up
the stairs leading to the room discuss
ing the probable winners of the day's
races. Wearing broad smiles as they
enter, they invariably emerge with
drawn faces, cursing their luck, and
blaming the clerk for inducing them
to part with their hard-earned money.
Recently Sergeants Martin and Coo-
gan, who alternate in the tenderloin I
district, determined to suppress the I
evil. They conferred with the Chief of !
Police with the result that a special de- !
tail of officers was sent to close the I
games. They established a sort of I
blockade, but, despite their efforts, the
games continued to flourish. Every day ,
two policemen are stationed in front of
each of the poolrooms with instruc- j
tions to warn the visitors that they are
liable to arrest.
Notwithstanding the vigilance of the j
police the games thrive solely through
the evident determination of the women i
patrons to play the races.

in Detail.

Provided for the Library
Patronage.
DEMOCRATS TO BE FIRED.
An Agreement to Abide by the Unit
Rule in Making Appointments
to Office.
The position taken by Governor Budd
respecting the Board of State Library
Trustees, who were enected by the last
Assembly to take office February 28,
1898, has excited a great deal of com
ment, and given rise to many specula
tions as to the precise contents of the
caucus letter sent to the several can
didates.
The written demands made upon the
aspirants for membership in the new
board under signature of the Republi
can caucus committee, and the pledges
responslvely said to have been made by
four of the five members elect, are held
by the Governor to constitute a vio
lation of the purity of elections law.
On this ground, it is announced, he
will decline to certify to the elections.
The Incumbent board will refuse to
vacate unless their successors present
the necessary certificates, thus forcing
the questions as to the legality of the
election and the proper qualification of
the new members into the courts for
settlement.
It will be recalled that the election of
Messrs. Ryan of Sacramento, Neff of
Colfax, Lemmon of Santa Rosa, Flint
Sr. of Monterey, and Lee of Los An
geles, was decided upon, not by the
Republican caucus immediately after
the names of candidates had been sub
mitted, but a week later. The interim
was employed by a committee com
posed of John H. Dickinson.
Thomas Flint Jr. and W. H. Price,
in securing pledges requiring candi
dates to agree to the adoption of a
majority policy, intended to give to
the Republicans the entire library pat
ronage. The plan was to render it im
possible for Democrats to hold posi
tions under the board of trustees, de
spite the provision of law de
signed to make personal competence
rather than political predilection the
proper test of fitness for library ser
vice.
The requirement that no person hold
ing a library position should be removed
except by a unanimous decision on the
part of the board was deemed a proper
safeguard for meritorious occupants.
In order to get around this statutory
prescription and bind the incoming
board to a partisan programme it was
decided by the managers of the Repub
lican caucus to make the board a unit
in the matter of making new library
appointments.
That is to say. the appointment of
any and all Republicans chosen by the
majority composed of three members
was to be approved by the minority,
and the board as a whole was to be
pledged to the replacement of Demo
crats by Republicans.
Great caution and secrecy were used
by the caucus committee in securing
the pledges, as the members seem to
have been fully aware of the delicacy
of their undertaking.
Under the presumption that the Gov-
ernor supported himself In his present
attitude by an authentic copy of the
letter so adroitly circulated, he was ap
pealed to yesterday by a representative
of The Call for a fac simile of it. He
admitted that he had one of the let
ters, but would not, for the present, ex
pose it. Nor would he positively ex
press his intentions as to the course to
be pursued respecting the certifications.
From another quarter, after diligent
research, the caucus letter, now des
tined to take a place in the history of
practical politics in California, was
obtained. Subjoined is its full text:
January 27, 1897.

sued by the Board to be elected on the 3d
day of February next.
As you understand, there are five
trustees; that no one in a position in the
library can be removed without the unan
imous consent of the five; that while the
Republican party were in control at tne
times of the election of trustees which j
have occurred during the past ten years !
the entire patronage of the library has i
been left with and given to the Demo- j
cratic party, and the library hRs to this !
extent been a factor in the politics of j
the State.
We are instructed to Inform you that it j
is the sense of the caucus that whoever :
should be elected a member of the coming 1
board of trustees should give his assur- 1
ance that he will see that Republicans i
are to be given not only the preference, !
but are to be placed in and occupy the ]
positions in said library under their con- \
trol or that of the State Librarian whom |
they may select; also, that as no such
change can be made without unanimous
consent, you will give your assurance to â¢
abide by the will of the majority of the
trustees as to any removal: also to pledge '
the Librarian selected to employ only Re- j
publicans as assistants in his office.
As instructed, we now send tÃis* com- i
municatlon to you and should be pleased
to hear from you by letter or telegram
at your earliest convenience and in any i
event before the afternoon of Tuesday, :
the 2d of February next. Very respect- i
fully, your obedient servants.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it. if any. the
amount ol rainfall, of melted snow In inches
and hundredth? during the past twelve hours.
Isobar*, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. Thr word "hich" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "law" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is hich in the interior and low
along the const, and the isobars extend north
and south alone the coast, rain is probable;
b-]f when th^ "low" is in^sed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, ami I ire falllnp to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK. Feb. 15.â T0-day's sharp rally
in is to be attributed to the covering of
short contracts put out in yesterday's flurry.
Buyfng was said to be heavy for Washington
account, which was a heavy seller yesterday.
Yesterday's losses were more than recovered
In most cases, notwithstanding a smaller vol
ume of business to-day. There was at least
one period of general reaction during the day,
but It was of short duration .and declines
reached *maU proportions. ' There was also
profit taking in a few special stocks, which
did not aftect the general list to a noticeable
extent. American securities continued to be
favorites on the London Stock Exchange,
' vhere prices of Americans were marked up
" wi'h a distinctly coaÃdent tone before the
opining here, and London continued a buyer
here even -alter prK.es had advanced to the
London parity. Jn:<-L (treat Â«*at laid un this
as indicating a definite change in the attitude
of the British investing public toward Amer
. lean securities. They were persistent sellers
of Americas during all of last summer and
during the subsequent rise, which has been
almost continuous since November. They are
jiow buying American stocks at prices many
points above where they sold. This buying
is regarded far more significant on account of
the higher rates of money in London as com
pared with New York, and the heavy balance
of exchange still known to be outstanding in
favor of this country. In Paris Spanish 4s de
clined on fears of strained relations between
the United States and Spain, and American
securities declined on some of the Continental
exchanges, but London heeded none of these
. considerations and continued buying at ad
vancing prices. Foreign exchange begins to
reflect this buying, and the demand for ster
ling to-day declined one-fourth and cable
transfers the same amount. Metropolitan
Street Railway showed a continuance of yes
terday's weakness after an early period of
ptrength. and dropped four points. It sub
sequently rallied, but closed to-day with a
sharp loss. Other local securities were strong.
Minnesota Iron was conspicuously heavy and
Lake Shore ruled bel iw last nlgth's price.
There were a few losses shown by conspicuous
stocks, but the general level of prices at the
close was very materially higher. In the act
ive list net gains of between one and two
points for the day were frequent.
The strength and activity In bonds In
creased as the day passed. Total sales, $4,360,
000.
United States old 4s registered, the new is
reglstered and the 6s were, 4e higher bid and

IX>NDON MARKET.
XF.W YORK, Feb. 15 â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: All the
stock markets here were dominated to-day by
politics, Americans by Cuban affairs and
other markets by the general outlook.
Americans opened over the parity, gave way,
rallied on reports that Spain had Issued an
apologetic letter, relapsed in the absence of
information of the report, and finally cl<isÂ»d
rather firm on New York support. Copper
shares were strong on Paris buying. It is diffi
cult to fathom wholly the reason for the fall
in the prices of gold. The reported reason,
however, is apprehension that Russian and
other continental demands will be less press-
Ing in the future. The slightly easier tone on
the money market was partly due to this de
cline In bar gold.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 15.â For a few minutes fol
lowing the opening in Wheat it looked as if
the dollar mark for May was at last to be
reached. There was hardly any Wheat offered
for sale on the curb, and this condition also
prevailed when the regular market opened. Re
ports that Letter had contracted with the Le
high road for the moving of 2,000,000 bushels
of his Wheat to the seaboard came from New
York. They were not substantiated, but the
report rapidly spread that May Wheat is al
most completely tied up by Letter influences,
and when the market opened there was a rush
of anxious shorts to get under cover. May
Wheat closed yesterday at 9SVi@9BVic, opened
to-day at 98H@9SÂ«fee. Even at this substantial
advance the market was almost bare of offer
ings and the price was bid up steadily to d9Â«io.
A peculiar feature of the advance was the
number of stop loss orders in short Wheat.
Wheat began to come out after a "call" price.
99^Â»c, had been passed, but offerings were
eagerly accepted and the market did not hesi
tate much until 99* ie had been reached. This
price brought out a kit of Wheat from com
mission houses and May dropped back to 90'^c.
There it hung for a time. Argentine cables
repeated yesterday reports of poor thrashing
returns and lower exportable estimates. A lit
tle before midday the price shot up again under
a renewed demand from shorts, and May got
to 99v4c before the reaction came. Letter had
sold no Wheat during the day. On the con
trary, he was credited with buying a little.
This added to the belleX that hÂ« is in control

THE DANGEROUS SEALSKIN.
Perhaps the safest and timeliest course
for contemporary owners of sealskin furs
is to lock them up in a strong box, and
sit on the box and call for help. The
stories of the experiences and sufferings
of persons who have recently been caught
with sealskins on them are very terrify
ing, and warrant all the precautions
above suggested. It is proper to say.
though, that proprietors of sealskins are
In no real danger so long as they keep
away from Uncle Sam's Custom-houses.
Hereditary sealskins may be worn with
Impunity in the country without any real
hazard "of arrest or police surveillance.
It is when you try to bring your sealskin
through the Custom-house that the rub
comes. You must then either produce a
Custom-house permit entitling you to
bring that particular hide back Into the
land of -liberty, or you must be prepared
with convincing evidence about the pedi
gree, gender and former residence of the
seal: who caught it: who killed It; who
dressed it; who made it up, and many
ot"her biological and biographical details.
If your Rtory and your evidence hang to
gether you "may bring in your skin, but
the chances are that you will think your
self lucky to escape without It.
The new treasury regulations which re
quire all this red tape are well adapted
to make the use of sealskins by travelers
to or from the United States excessively
unpopular. They make the most trouble
on the Canadian frontier, where, as win
ter is really winter up there, peoole. wear
sealskins much more than In the lati
tude of New York. There may be some
solace for some persons in the recollec
tion that all the trouble about sealskins is
due to Canada, and that there is a sort
of propriety In letting the Canadians and
their visitors experience most of the con
sequent inconvenience. The hitch about
that, however, is that the folks who hunt
the seals and the folks who wear the
skins are different people, without special
community of interests or mutual sympa
thies. The ostensible purpose of the" regu
lations is to keep out of this country
skins of seals killed in waters of the Pa
cific north of the 35th degree of north
latitude, which is the district as to the
regulation of which the United States and
Great Britain cannot agree. â Harper's
Weekly.
Belladonna is a deadly poison, and
should never be applied to the eyes
except by the hands of an experienced
oculist or physician. The result of its
frequent and indiscriminate use is total
blindness.

WILL BURN
THE EVIDENCE
Matties Sensation Will Be
Blotted Out For
ever.
Many Apologies Said to Be
Now Due to Rev. Dr.
McLean.
Those Who Called Him a Viper
Have a Duty Yet to Per
form.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
:â¢ Â£ Broadway, Feb. 15.
When Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean returns
from Boston, where he is at present,
the C. O. Brown scandal will end with
a little bonfire, if the majority of the
Bay Conference Committee has its way.
The action taken yesterday at Chi
cago is received with great satisfaction
by the many supporters of Dr. McLean
in this city, where he was pastor for
twenty-five years.
In Dr. McLean's study is the cele
brated affidavit of Mattie Overman that
the doctor has protected so carefully
for over a year. It is said to be a con
vincing document, but its contents will
never be made known for the commit
tee, being now vindicated, is anxious
to have the condemning document
burned, so that it can never be heard
from again.
The latter clause of the resolution
passed yesterday at Chicago is particu
larly gratifying to the Bay Conference
as it is a clear apology for the action
of the Chicago Conference in receiving
into its membership a man who was
under suspension of a co-ordinate asso
ciation.
"When Dr. McLean returns." said an
officer of the First Congregational
Church to-day, "there should be more
apologies made to him. When the case
was being heard in Oakland Dr. Mc-
Lean was assailt-d must mercilessly by
people who should not have permitted
their confidence in him to be shaken by
a man like C. O. Brown. Ho has been
shamefully persecuted throughout and
â was actually called 'a viper* at Chica
go. Now that the matter has been
straightened out pome people have yet
a duty to perform."
Dr. McLean is now in Boston and
will not be home for some time. He will
probably stay at Chicago on his way
home and receive in person the apol
ogies from those who six months ago
hissed at him.
MILE-LIMIT
LAW ENFORCED
Berkeley Cigar - Dealers Ar
rested for Selling Intoxi-
eating Liquors.
The Offenders to Be Vigorously
Prosecuted Under the State
Law.
BERKELEY, Feb. 15.â Marshal Rich
ard Lloyd made a raid on a number of
Berkeley cigar stores this afternoon, and
as a result four menâ Jake Mohr, E. E.
Toby, James Overall and Charles Srhu
manâwere arrested for selling intoxicat
ing liquor in violation of the mile, limit
law. Toby, Mohr and Overall are pro
prietors of cigar stores in which beer and
whisky in various amounts were found. .
Schuman is a driver for the Viking Bot- ,
tling Company. Marshal Lloyd arrested
him for selling a half dozen bottles of
lager to Jake Mohr. For some time past
be -has been selling in Berkeley a con
siderable quantity of beer said to be non- !
intoxicating.
The first formal complaint that the
mile limit law was being violated, was
made by Marshal Lloyd last night in
hie report to the Town Trustees. He
stated that the cigar stores in East ;
Berkeley, with a single exception, while
ostensibly engaged in a legitimate busi
ness, were also carrying on illegitimate j
trade by soiling intoxicating liquors.
"Many also," he added, "carry on gamb
ling, not to a very great extent, but
enough to lead young men to bad hab
its. In view of the fact that the pro

SWIFTWATER
IS AMBITIOUS
Will Try to Beat the Re- |
lief Train to Dawson
City.
Meantime His Lovely Home
in Oakland Is De
serted.
Banker Henshaw Satisfied That Mr.
Gates Is a Man of
Honor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway. Feb. 15.
Mr. Gates, perhaps better known as ;
"Swiftwater Bill," has undertaken aâ¢ |
contract to bfat the Government relief j
expedition to the Klondike. Swiftwater ,
declares he can get to Dawson City ;
first, and is confident that his dogs will
beat Uncle Sam's reindeer. i
In a few days Mr. Gates will return
to Oakland and the steamer ho has been |
East to purchase will come around the
Horn and will be here in plenty of time
to be at the mouth of the Yukon when
navigation opens. Gates will not wait |
for this, however, for he Intends to go
across the pass and take a load of pro- ,
visions with him and have a depot built
ready to receive the cargo of his
steamer. !
"Mr. Gates is a determined fellow,
paid Banker Will G. Henshaw of this
city, who sold Swiftwater his $25,000 i
home, "and when he undertakes a pro- ,
jert it is pretty sure that he will carry
it through. He will organize an expedi
tion as soon as he returns and will take ,
thirty able men north with him. He
will look after them and guarantee them
work after they arrive there. He '
pees that if he can get a supply of goods
to Daweon City ahead of the Govern
ment train he can do a good thing and
he can be depended upon to get there.
We shall have our steamer out here by
the middle of May and it will at once
be loaded and sent north.
"By the time the cargo gets up the j
river, Mr. Gates (Banker Henshaw
never says 'Swiftwater') will have gone
in over the pass and erected our depot.
We have made inquiry and find that
Mr. Gates stands very high in Alaska.
One man tells us that he has loaned
him large sums at times without the
scratch of a pen, and you know that is
even more than an Oakland* banker
would do," and Mr. Henshaw smiled.
There is some curiosity as to what
Mr. Gates will do with his beautiful
Oakland mansion. He bought it before
the honeymoon was at its zenith, and
mainly because Mrs. Swiftwater
thought it would be pleasant to have a
residence on this aristocratic side of the
bay. Now the Gates' troubles are so
diversified that society does not know
whether to congratulate itself or not. â¢
One thing is nojv regarded as certain,
and that is, that when Mr. Gates gave
out that he was worth $1,800,000, he did
not underestimate his assets.
WATER BATES.
The Trustees Decide That They Shall
Remain the Same as x^ast
Year.
ALAMKPA, Feb. 15.â The City Trustees
met as a committee of the whole last
evening to discuss the mntter of water
rates. The trustees evinced no dlspo-
Mti'.ii to lower the rates paid by private
consumers, although an argument was
made to show that such a reduction
might be made and still leave the com
pany a good rate of interest on its in
vestment. The manager of the com
pany asked that the price paid by the
City for fire hydrants be increased. He
alleged that during the past eleven years
the company had put into its plant
over $11.0<*t more than it had taken out.
and he also said that it had been put i
to great expense by the damage done to
its pipes from electrolysis. He also
said that out of the 2700 consumers in
the city there were 1900 who last month
did not pay as much as $1 each for
water.
The matter was discussed fully and fin
ally the trustees refused to raise the
rate paid by the city or reduce that paid
by consumers, adopting the same sched
ule as last year. This calls for 30 cents
per 1000 gallons to private parties. $1 min
imum; for street sprinkling, 15 cents per
1000 gallons; flush tanks, $1. and hydrants,
$1. These figures give quite general sat
isfaction.

Many Big Changes Are Now
Contemplated in the
Harbor.
The Hope for the Tidal Canal Not I
So Dim as It Was a Month
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 15.
There is much doubt regarding, the
future of the harbor east of Webster
street bridge and the Alamedans are
congratulating themselves that they
have obtained a partial victory. Cer
tain it is that the prospects are not â 
so good as they were three months ago
for the completion of the Oakland har
bor before anything is done with the
tidal canal.
Apparently the War Department, if
it has not changed its mind, is at least, ;
taking more time to think. Only a i
small portion of the money available
tl to be spent in the near future, and
now comes the startling ' intelligence
that the improvements east of the ;
bridges, tidal canal and all, will not be
taken up until Congress decides what :
shall be done.
There is a big difference between the
specifications as they were sent to j
Washington, and as they returned. All |
that related to East Oakland had been
cut out and only a reduced portion of
the work west of the bridges was left
in. The bids that are now asked will
be opened on March 10, and call for the
removal of enough mud to deepen the
channel to twenty feet. The bids will
be opened by Major Heuer, who is in
charge of the work. Colonel Suter, of
course being general supervisor of all [
harbor improvements on the coast. .
Now the question has arisen, .Why
these changes from the recommenda
tion of Colonel Suter? The money was
appropriated by Congress some time
ago and is now available t"> the amount '
of $666,000, not more than 25 per cent to ,
be expended in one year. The work out
lined in the specifications on which bids
are now asked will not cost nearly one
year's maximum allowance, and it is
very evident that the hopes of the Oak
land advocates have received a setback,
while Alameda's continued protest ap
pears to have had some effect on Secre

The San Francisco Boy Puts

Lively Contests Held nt the Reliance
Club's Gentlemen's
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
910 Broadway, Feb. 15.
A large audience enjoyed the Reliance
Club's gentlemen's night this evening.
The entertainment opened with a selec
tion by the club orchestra. Following this
were the preliminaries, which were un
usually good.
The first preliminary was a three-round
go between Jake Baumgarten and John
Dalton, followed by another three-round
go between Lon Agnews and Charles Tye.
Then Tommy Ryan and Henry B*ker
boxed three very scientific rounds. Billy
Jordan acted as master of ceremonies.
The first of the main events was a four
round go between Dick Condon ami Jack
McMahon of San Francisco. Frank Ce
reni acted as referee. The first round
was very tame, the second and remain
ing rounds were all in favor of McMa
hon.
Condon Beemed to become very tired.
McMahon got the decision. The next
event was an eight-round go between
Martift McCue of New York and Yank
Savage of Vailejo. McCue weighed 125
pounds and was seconded by Henry Ba
ker, Jack Jeffries and Dewitt Van Court.
Savage weighed 133 and was seconded
by Jack Burns, Jim Lewis and Jim Casey
Billy Hughes acted as referee. The first
round was rather tame. In the second
round McCue landed several good punches
on Savage's jaw, heart and stomach
without any return. Savage did not
seem to be able to land on McCue. The
third, fourth and remaining rounds were
all very much in favor of McCue, who
punched Savage when and wherever he
wanted. The referee, of course, gave
McCue the decision.
The last event of the evening â¢vras an
eight-round go between Billy Gifford of
Vallejo and John Irwin, better known as
Young Sharkey, of San Francisco. Lon
Agnew officiated as referee. From the
moment the gong sounded they went at
It hammer and tongs, give and take, re
gardless of any science whatever. In the
second round Sharkey caught Gifford a
left jab on the chin and put him to sleep.
It was announced that Martie McCue
would fight Jimmy Lawler at the Re
liance Club within two weeks.
The Reliance Baseball Club will play
the C. J. Heeseman Club at Central Park
next Sunday for {he benefit of James Ar
lett, who recently met with an accident.

Beginning of the Trouble.
OAKLAND, Feb. 15.â Joslah P. Ames
was the only witness to-day in the suit
of his sister against, him to recover rail
road bonds, lie told how she had cared
for him in his youth, and in her old age
he had been asked to care for her prop
erty. He then went into detail regarding
the various sums of money he had re
ceived. He said the letter referred to in
the complaint was one from his wife to
her Fon, Everett, in which she stated
that she and her daughter were in arrears
to the Ebell Society and would be sus
pended if it were not paid. She asked
him to take $10 from the rent money and
pay the dues. She had declared that his
wife was teaching Everett to steal. This
angered him, and he told her if she or
any person said anything wrong about
his wife and children she was lying. She
clenched her list and cried, "You are a
liarâ a lfnrâ a liar!" He apologized in
the evening. The. rents referred to were
his, he said, and not Mrs. Harris". The
case will be continued to-morrow.

" I TALK TOO
MUCH" SAYS
CROCKER
He Complains of an
Interview but Can-
not Correct It.
Trouble Over His Criti-
cism of the Wine-
makers' Association.
An Explanation of Why He
Said It "Bunkoed" Mrs.
Kohler Demanded.
HE HAS NONE TO GIVE.
Offered a Chance to Make a
ment, Mr. Crocker Only Asks
He Be "Set Right."
Henry J. Crocker, president of the
California Wine Makers' Corporation,
"talks too much." He has himself said
so, and events now occurring give to
his word 3 confirmation sure as proofs
of Holy Writ. In fact the war between
the California Wine Makers' Corpora
tion and the California Wine Associa
tion is developing incidents which will
be interesting to a large number of
people not directly concerned in the
Issues of the fight. It was in connec
tion with one of these that Mr. Crocker
made his admission of talking too
much, and now finding himself in
trouble is trying to get out of it by
writing too much.
The matter 1b pertinent to the news
of the day by reason of the following
letter:
San Francisco, Feb. 9, 1893.
H. J. Crocker,
508 California Street.
William Thomas Esq.â Dear Sir: Your
favor of February S* to hand enclosing
one from you to The Call of February 5.
The first letter I had from you I de
livered to The Call representative and
have not seen it since.
1 will say in all fairness that the printed
article in The Call, to which the Wine
Association took offense, did them an in-
Justlce, as well as myself, and this was
acknowledged by Mr. Burke in your of
fice.
I now say that I did not use the words
attributed to me by The Call, nor in the
sense of the article are my well-known
views represented.
I could not possibly have known what
took place between Mrs. Koh'ier and the
association in their business deals, nor
would I be able to state as a fact that
she had been bunkoed into receiving
4,u00,00ti of stock in a 3,U00,U00 corporation,
as stated by The Call.
As I told you, I am perfectly willing
to have you proceed against me in the
matter if The Call does not care to cor
rect the publication as it seemed willing
to do at the time. Yours very truly,
HENRY J. CROCKER.
It will be seen that the letter refers
to an article published in The Call of
January 27, which contained an Inter
view with Mr. Crocker on the subject
of the controversy between the Wfne
Makers' Corporation and the Califor
nia Wine Association. In the inter
view certain statements were made
which the Association regarded as of
fensive and they called upon Mr.
Crocker for an explanation.
When the attorneys of the Wine
Makers' Association demanded of Mr.
Crocker an explanation of his state
ments In the interview concerning Mrs.
Kohler, he set about trying to put him
self right, and with that object asked
the manager of The Call to straighten
the matter out in the paper.
Mr. Crocker was informed that if The
Call had misquoted him it would gladly
make the correction necessary to do
him justice. He was requested to point
out in the printed interview any
thing which he had not said, but
this he would nut do. He was
told that if he desired to make a
statement The Call would publish it.
Ho said that he had no statement to
make. All that could be gained from
him in that interview was that ho
wished The Call to set him right and
get him out of the trouble the pub
lished interview had brought upon him.
It was in that conversation he said.
"I have talked too much."
At the close of the conversation with
the manager of The Call, Mr. Crocker
was told to call at the editorial rooms
and consult with the city editor and
the reporter with whom he had had the
interview, being assured that if he
could or would point out to them any
part of the printed interview that did
him an injustice or misrepresented him
a correction would be made.
He visited the editorial rooms and
conferred with those gentlemen, but to
them, as to the manager, he declined
to make a statement in the paper over
his own signature, nor would he assert
that any portion of the published in
terview was essentially different from
what he had said. He stated that he
would like to have a portion of it cor
rected, but would not say it contained
anything he had not said, nor would
he make the correction himself. Here
again his only explanation was "I

talked too much." He evidently de
sired The Call to get him out of a
scrape of his own making by contra
dicting for him a statement which he
would not contradict himself.
In his tortuous efforts at escaping
from the responsibility for his words
Mr. Crocker has brought Mr. Hugh M.
Burke of The Call into the. controversy
without any reason at all. Mr. Burke
was not the reporter who interviewed
Mr. Crocker, and accordingly could not
and did not know whether he had been
correctly reported or not. Mr. Burke
is at present out of the city, but his an
swer to the statements concerning him
in Mr. Crocker's letter Is made in the
following telegram:
HOTEL, COKONADO, Cal., Feb. 15.â 1
never told Henry Crocker, or any other
one. thut The Call did the Wine Associa
tion Injustice. I did not writ* and have
not read the article complained of. When
directed by The Call to see Thomas, the
lawyer, I went to the law office with Mr.
Crocker, who went there to square him
self, and simply remarked that if The
Call had misquoted any one it would see
the matter straight.
HUGH ML BURKE.
The Call takes no partisan view of
the unfortunate controversy between
the Wine Makers' Corporation and the
California Wine Association. It would
like to see the two bodies working to
gether in harmony for the welfare of
that important industry of the State,
and has therefore an interest in bring
ing about a settlement of their differ
ences, but no interest whatever in their
contests. It sought the interview with
Mr. Crocker for no other object than
of obtaining information concerning
the outlook for wine prices. That in
formation it desired for the instruction
of the general public, as the subject is
one of considerable Importance to a
large number of people.
Neither the city editor of The Call
nor the reporter sent out on the detail
knew anything about the Kohler case.
Mr. Crocker was not asked anything
about it. He volunteered the informa
tion and gave it as an essential portion
of his interview, because he made it the
basis of his argument that the affairs
<>f the association have been "steadily
on the decline." To have omitted it
fmm the interview would have been
to remove the whole foundation of
many of his most important state
ments.
The Call has given Mr. Crocker
every opportunity to set himself right.
It has offered to correct anything which
he would expressly assert to have been
in error in the report of his talk. It
has offered to publish any statement
he would make on the subject. He has
declined both offers, and has given no
explanation except to say "I have
talked too much." Now he has taken
to writing letters which make the mat
ter worse. He that talks too much gets
one foot in it and has trouble, but he
that writes too much gets in it with
both feet and is lost.

Browne; recording secretary, Mrs. Eliza

J. Bacon; treasurer, Mrs. Barstow.
Mrs. Wolfenden, the secretary, in mak
ing her annual report, emphasized the
fact that the ladiec of Oakland did not
give the organization the support that
they should. She compared the work in
this city with that of Cambridge, Mass.,
a place a little under in population. Last
year, with the membership at $1, the in
come in the East was $1052 last year, and
$77 in this city. This the secretary held
to be a slur upon the good name of the
city and one that should not be allowed
to remain. She said Oakland was not
lacking in noble women who are given

HIT THE RING
FOR THOUSANDS
Roadwarmer's Winning
the Most Successful
Coup of the Season.
Four Winning Favorites Also
Played Havoc With the
Bookmakers.
Torsidsi Defeated Her Field Handily.
Mahogany Ran Second at
Odds of 230 to 1.
The "syndicate" unloaded a steam
ing hot one on the betting ring at
Emeryville yesterday. The layers of
odds were taken unawares, for it came
off in the very first number on the
card. Among the sixteen starters was
the so-termed "half-breed" Road
warmer. The projectors of the coup
had such confidence in the sprinter
that they kept the name of his rider
in the background until the last min
ute, and then gave out that Joe
Weber, an obscure jockey, was to do
the piloting. The ring proved easy
game. The bookies couldn't stand for
Joe and laid 15 to 1 against his mount.
The Daly entry Distinction looked
pretty good, especially so as Conley
had the leg up, and they reached out
for the Roadwarmer money and got it
in large packages. Sickly looking men
In the last stages of tubercolosis sud
denly became possessed of twenty-dol
lar pieces; messenger boys, bamboo
artists and seedy looking individuals
-who. looked as though a square meal
â¢would give them Klondicitis were all
jumbled together in the ring trying to
get some of that 15 to 1. The price
finally fell to 8. The start was a good
one, with the "good thing" showing
out in front. He was never headed
and, trailed throughout by the favor
ite, won by less than a length. It was
currently reported that anywhere from
57000 to $10,000 was taken from the
ring.
The bookmakers had a hard time of
it throughout the afternoon. ' Four
heavily played first choices reached the
wire in front, and it is more than jike
ly there will be several absentees from
the block at to-day's cut In.
San Augustine was considered by
form students about the best of the
peven starters in the two-year-old
pcramble, and closed in the betting a
plight choice over the Burns & Water-
Jiouse entry, Malay. Thorpe on the lat
ter was cut off soon after the start, but
again took the lead in the stretch, win
ning cleverly from the first choice. In
a nose finish for the show honors The
Miller gained the decision over Foxey.
In the seven-furlong run, with but
four facing the barrier, Torsida with
"Skeets" Martin in the saddle ruled
favorite in the betting, and. catching
Lord Marmion in the home run, downed
theSt. Carlo colt handily at the wire by
over two lengths in 1:27 flat. Morellito
was hustled along too fast the first part
by Thorpe and was an indifferent third.
The mile and a sixteenth event, de
cided under selling conditions, was
taken rather handily by the favorite,
Rey del Tierra. Sent out in front from
the start by Clawson, Purser's horse
made all the running and led Lena past
the judges more than a length. Lost
Oirl ran a remarkably good race, fin
ishing a close third.
The muchly scratched out Chihuahua,
Instead of backing up In the betting,
ivas played down yesterday, and did
not forget to bring home the goods.
Pent over to the post an 8 to 5 favorite
for the five and a half furlong sprint,
the gelding was in front from the first
jump, and, hard ridden at the end, fin
ished less than a length before the 250
to 1 chance Mahogany, with McDonald

FLOOD'S LIPS
ARE UNSEALED
The Aged Cashier Says He Did
Not Gain by Altering the
Donohoe=Kelly Books,
Coogan and Fox Are Thought to be the Men
Who Made the Money and Pardon
Will Be Asked.
According to a confession made to
Attorney W. W. Foote. the lips of
James W. Flood, the convicted
cashier, who is serving a term at San
Quentin for embezzling fund* of the
Donohoe-Kelly Bank, will he unseaVil
at a meeting of the prison directors to
day. He will ask for a' pardon, and the
aged cashier's defense will be, in short,
that he was a partner of the firm, and
that he acted as he did in the matters
that caused him trouble because he was
a partner, therefore without criminal
intent, and that he did not have a fair
trial.
It will be contended that Flood, in
the capacity of partner of the firm,
loaned an amount exceeding one hun
dred thousand dollars. He advanced
this amount to James Coogan and one
Fox, who married a daughter of Sen
ator Stewart of Nevada. These men
had had a number of transactions at
the bank and their credit had always
been good. Coogan was asphyxiated
soon after the transactions that
caused Flood trouble and Fox
was never found afterward, from
which it was inferred that he made a
sudden exit from the country. Whether
Coogan committed suicide or was acci
dentally killed has never been ascer
tained.
A significant fact about the appeal
for mercy is that if the convicted
cashier had told all he knew long ago,
owing to the fact that he was in no
manner benefited by the crime, it is
likely that he would never have been
compelled to serve in the penitentiary.
According to Flood's story he ad
vanced the money in question without
the knowledge or consent of the bank.
At the time of the alleged crime the
bank had just sustained a shortage
BACHMANN IS
BADLY WANTED
He Was Treasurer of the San
Francisco Grutli-
Verein.
The Society Defrauded Out of Over
SI2OO and His Creditors Left
Unpaid.
The police are making diligent in
quiries in different parts of the State
for John E. Bachmann, a saloon-keeper
at 100 Ellis street, but they have small
chance of locating nim as he has had
several days' start of them.
Bachmann besides carrying on the
business of a saloon-keeper was treas
urer of the San Francisco Grutli-Ver
ein, an organization established for
benevolent and social purposes. It has
a membership of abo-ut 300 and has its
headquarters at 421 Post street. The
secretary is Charles Mueller.
The organization gave a masquerade
ball on February 5 at Saratoga Hall.
It was a great success, and after pay
ing all expenses there was a sum of
over $600 to be handed over to Treas
urer Bachmann. Bachmann got the
money the following day and the offi
cers of the society congratulated them
selves upon having money in the
treasury, as a few days previous Bach
mann had drawn out $600 to pay a
death claim to the widow of one of
the members, but, which it was found,
he failed to do.
Their jcry was short-lived, as the ru
mor reached the ears of the secretary
Monday that Bachmann has abscond
ed and that his saloon was in the
hands of the Sheriff. It did not take
long to satisfy himself of the truth of
the rumor,' and he immediately con
sulted the trustees. The result was
that Louis Hauser, a dairy and pro
duce dealer, 2216 Fillmore street, as
one erf the trustees, swore to a com
plaint in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday morning charging Bach
mann with felony embezzlement in get
ting away with the $1200.
Bachmann's downfall is attributed
to gambling on the races and to his
fondness for fast women. About a
month ago his wife obtained a divorce
from him on the ground of failure to
provide. His friends say that when
he left the city a few days ago a well
known woman of questionable char
acter acec-mpanied him.
Besides the police several creditors
are very anxious to ascertain his
whereabouts, as it is said he has left
a considerable amount of unpaid bills
behind him.
CAPTAIN GOODALL ARRESTED.
Charged With Cruelly Beating and
Wounding Seamen on the
Cottage City.
Captain Harry Goodall of the steamer
Cottage City was arrested yesterday by
United States Marshal Baldwin on a
warrant charging him with beating and
â wounding seamen. Tho captain was at
once taken before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock and was released
on his own recognizance until February
25. when he will appear for examina
tion.
The complaint was made two weeks ago
on the arrival of the Cottage City by
August Tode who brought five or six
other mrmbers of the crew to verify his
statement. Their story as told to Dep
uty United States Attorney Bert Schles
inger was to the effect that Goodall kept
the crew at work *on several occasions
for twenty-four hours at a stretch with
out any interval of rest, and that on one
of those occasions, when they asked for
half an hour's rest, the captain refused
to grant their request and ordered them
to "turn to." which in sailor parlance
means some kind of work. The crew
at once mutinied and would neither turn
"to" nor "from." In fact, they would
not turn at all.
Tode, as spokesman and ringleader, was
put in irons, and he and the seamen with
him asserted that while ironed he was
beaten by the captain.
Captain Goodall denies the charge. The
sailors at the time they made the com
plaint were inmates of the Sailors' Home,
but they informed the United States At
torney a few days afterward that they
had removed to a sailor boarding house
on Mission street. It is believed that
they, or many of them, have gone to sea.
A Sovereign Remedy .
Dr. Parker's Cough Cure, 1 dose will stop
cough; never fails; 25c; all druggist*. â¢
owing to bad loans to a man in Contra
Costa County whose name is unknown
to the general public. Flood, it seems,
did not desire to have his bank know
that he had advanced the money which
p..t him into trouble, so he hoped
:,.-t hope that he could in some way
retrieve the losses that occurred by
reason of his unauthorized lendings.
If the story of his confession is to be
believed Flood took considerable money
of his own and put it into a sort of
hotch-potch fund so as to hide his
loaning transactions from the^ knowl
edge of his partners. In seeking to
hide the knowledge of what he had
done from his partners the cashier was
finally forced to falsify his books.
One of the strong points of the case
will be that Flood's conduct was
wholly without criminal intent. It is
alleged that he did nothing for per
sonal gain and that he was driven to
act through fear of involving himself
in trouble with his associates, and be
cause he, as cashier and a partner in
the transactions, was not to be judged
on the basis of a criminal.
Seen at the penitentiary Flood,
though quite reticent regarding the
transactions that involved him in
trouble and disgrace, said:
"I am as innocent of the crime as
you are, but I cannot talk about it.
I have no right to do so and I shall
not."
"Will you deny that a man named
Fox received about $50,000 of the money
which it is alleged you embezzled?" he
was asked. For the moment he
thought and then said:
"I will say nothing whatever. I am
innocent, and that is all."
He asked the reporter to realize the
position he was in and said he did not
see how he could say anything.
To-day the Prison Directors will meet
in special session. The regular meet
ing should have been held last Satur
day in San Quentin, but owing to a
lack of attendance it was adjourned.

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1898.
A NEW FEDERAL
VOLCANO RUMBLES
Former Clerks of Collector
Welburn Demand Reinstate
ment Without Fine.
United States Senators Will Enter the
Lists and Make Their
Fight.
That there Is another volcano nearly
ripe in the old red Federal building
there is no doubt in the minds of those
who know what is going on in political
circles.
The present perturbations and rumb
lings hover about the former precincts
of ex-Collector O. M. Welburn, and af
fect three clerks who were his tried and
trusted friends during his term of office.
These clerks are at present on the sus
pended list, owing to the evidence of
W. H. Dillard, the strange colored
clerk, who was contradicted by all of
them, and owing to the recommenda
tions, so reports go, of Captain Thrash
er, the relentless sleuth of the revenue
department.
If current reports be true the odd
feature of the case Is that the row
caused by the action of the local de
partment involves the reinstatement of
more Democrats than Republicans,
though Republicans in power seem to
be more eager for the reinstatement
than the Democrats themselves. The
general opinion Is that the matter will
soon reach a determination. The sus
pended clerks feel sure that they will
all be reinstated without loss of salary
for the many months they have been
idle since the trouble first began.
According to current reports Miss
Alice Davidson, J. H. Zemansky and
E. T. Lennon, clerks who were sus
pended because Dillard swore that they
authorized him to sign their certifi
cates, though all contradicted him, are
making Rome howl. They have friends
in Congress and out, and they are
bending every energy to have the dis
mantled clerks reinstated without any
loss of salary and without disgrace.
"It has been rumored in Federal cir
cles for several weeks," said a well-in
EVICTION ON COMMERCIAL STREET.
Secretary Kane Takes the Dockerill Children From Their
Mother, Who Is Unfit to Be Their Guardian.
Down in front of 20 Commercial street there is a little heap of rubbish that
no one but a Junk man would stop to look at twice. The junk men do stop to
look at it, but. they glance rather disdainfully at the single mattresses from
which the Btraw is leaking, at the three chairs, the battered kitchen stove, the
big empty demijohn, and the odd bundle of clothes tied up In the hurry of evic
tion.
Dockerill, a one-legged drummer who supplies ships with pallors, his wife and
his three childrenâ the youngest a year old, the oldest 6 yparsâ were put out of
their home yesterday morning for non-payment of rent. Their unhappy experi
ence is not the first of its kind. On Steuart street they tell a similar tale of
eviction. The only difference is that this time Secretary Kane of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has possession of the babies, and to make
the family misery complete, Dockerill and his wife are at outs.
It's a common enough story down on the water front, tragically common.
The only thing that relieves the gloom and the squalor of it is the fact that
even here there is a difference of opinion as to the respective merits and demer
its of Dockerill and his wife.
Mrs. Dockerill is not to be Been. But the neighbors, who are on the lookout
from the backdoors of the saloon, will give you their version of the tale.
"You know how thim wan-legged men is," says a stout, gray-haired woman
with a red shawl over her shoulders. "They're mean; that's what they are. They
seem to be mad 'cause you've got two legs and they've got but one. The children
were all right. They ought not take her children away. She cried this morning
an' said she didn't care about the furniture, but she wanted her children. The
furniture! D'ye know what I'd do if it was mine? I'd get a junk man to taka it
all aft for 50 cints. That's what I'd do."
Mr. Dockerill, on the contrary, tells you that he stood "it" too long, that the
children should have been taken from such a home yean before.
"The lady," he said, alluding to his wife, and steadying himself on his
crutches, "the lady'd been sober for free mont's. She'd took the pledge. An' last
night at wan o'clock, when I came home, there she was out on the streets yet, not
fit to take care of herself, and the children at home crying.
"I'm glad Mr. Kane's got the children, f n' that they're being properly cared
for out at the Catholic Orphan Asylum. I dressed 'em myself this morning an'
fixed 'em best way I could. She's no right with the children. They're better off."
Surely they are. In that dingy, poverty stricken household, which longed for
the dignity of a water-front lodging-house, and never attained it, there was
endless quarreling; and the demijohn bought for one often sufficed for two. It
would be difficult for the youthful Dockerills to find a worse home, and they
might Just be fortunate enough to stumble upon a better.
FRAZIER MAY
GET THE PLACE
The Position of Western Di
vision Superintendent Lies
Between Him and Wright.
Nothing Definite Will BÂ© Known
Until After the Return of General
Manager Kruttsehnltt.
The one topic of conversation in rail
road circles at present is the identity of
the man who will succeed to the place
in the Southern Pacific left vacant by the
death of A. D. Wilder. Though nothing
definite will be known until after the
return of General Manager Kruttschnitt
from his present tour of inspection over
the southern division of the road, yet it is
a foregone conclusion that the honor will
fall either to the lot of J. B. Wright, at
present and for many years past super
intendent of the Sacramento division, or
to J. L. Frazier, superintendent of the
coast division, with every indication in
favor of the latter.
Mr. Frazier has the reputation of being
one of the ablest men in the employ of the
Southern Pacific. He first attracted the
attention of Mr. Huntington by the
thoroughness of his management of a
division of the Chesapeake and Ohio
when the president of the Southern Pa
cific was interested in that road. Mr.
Frazier had 350 miles of track under his
control there, and such was the ability
he displayed that when Mr. Huntington
turned his attention to Western railroad
ing he brought Frazier out here and put
him in charge of the Wadsworth divi
sion.
His stay there, however, was of short
duration, and it was not long before he
was managing the coast division, a posi
tion the next in importance to that held
by Mr. Wilder.
The coast division now embraces the
narrow-gauge system, which includes the
ferries, and was originally called the
Santa Cruz division, but was amalgam
ated witn the coast division soon after
Mr. Frazier assumed the superintendency.
In Childhood's Realm.
An entertainment will be given by the
Simpson Memorial M. E. Church to-mor
row evening, the feature of which will
be "An Evening in Childhood's Realm."
O'Brien's patent spring: best and easiest
riding buggy made; rubber or steel tires.
O'Brien & Sons, Golden Gate avenue and
Polk street â¢
formed official yesterday, "that Collec
tor Lynch at one time received specific
orders to reinstate all the clerks with
out loss of salary. Captain Thrasher,
who has been trying to make a record,
objected, and for that reason there has
been a delay in the execution of the
order, but for which circumstance all
the clerks would have been back m
their places long ago. and the trouble
growing out of the Welburn affair, so
far as it affected others than he, would
have been a matter of the past."
Messrs. Gilchrist, Zemansky and Lln
non denied the story told by the colored
clerk Dlllard, while Miss Jessup, who
also knew of the story, was not called
at all.
According to reports current in Fed-,
eral circles Senators White and Perkins
have decided that if the suspended
clerks are not soon reinstated they will
introduce a resolution in the Senate
asking that the entire case affecting
the Collector's office be Investigated by
proper Federal authorities, in which
event there would be more of a stir
over local Federal politics than has
been heard in half a generation over
matters of even far greater import than
the status of a few clerks in a sub
ordinate position.
Though Collector Lynch has studi
ously avoided mention of the fact it is
now known that all of the clerks who
lost their places by reason of the evi
dence of Clerk Dillard some weeks ago
filed a spirited reply to the charges
against them. This was on record soon
after the trouble though this fact and
the contents of the reply have been
carefully suppressed by the Collector.
The clerks who are "on the inside"
say that the present Collector is almost
wholly under the domination of Captain
Thrasher. They are not opposed to the
captain, but they say he is so pugna
cious and so angered because the jury
found Welburn not guilty that he can
not for a moment tolerate any of the
former Collector's friends.
MORE WORK FOR
THE GRAND JURY
It Will Investigate Some Bonds
Submitted in the Police
Court.
They Had for Sureties Alexander
Campbell Jr. and Thomas
King.
It Is claimed that the Grand Jury will
have some work to do In the cases of the
two bondsmen for J. "W. Boardman and
George E. Brown, the druggists who
were prosecuted for unlawfully affixing
a counterfeit trademark on goods.
The defendants were to have appeared
in Police Judge Joachimsen's court on the
sth inst. , but when the casea were called
for trial it was found that the druggists
had jumped their bonds. Boardman is
said to be in Mexico at the present mo
ment, and Brown is still in the city. Tne
two bondsmen were Attorney Alexander
Campbell Jr. and Thomas King of 764
Mission street, and they both qualified
on real estate of the alleged value of
$3000. It is now reported that neither of
the bondsmen owns real estate of that
value, and that the city stands a very
poor chance of collecting the amount of
the defendants' bonds.
It is alleged that Judge Carroll Cook
has taken a hand in the matter, and pro
poses to bring Attorney Alexander Camp
bell Jr. before the Grand Jury on a
charge of obtaining the release of a pris
oner on defective bonds, and It is said
that the jurors will take some action in
the case to-day.
The North Pole Project.
Lieutenant R. E. Peary, U. S. N., the
Arctic explorer, delivered a most Inter
esting lecture at Metropolitan Hall last
night, and those who were present list
ened to a vivid description of the hard
ships experienced by the hardy explorer
in penetrating the region of ice which is
supposed to lead to the hitherto undiscov
ered North Pole. What made the lecture
doubly Interesting was a series of stereop
ticon views collected by the Lieutenant
during his travels In the land designated
by him as the Arctic Sahara, and the pic
tures were received with the liveliest ex
pressions of satisfaction and demonstra
tions of applause by the audience which
gathered to hear him. He will repeat his
lecture to-night.

Miners Will Have
Their Own Works
If Necessary.
Why the Price of Blast
ing Powder Suddenly
Advanced.
The Manufacturers Become
Weary of Competing
Against One Another.
PROFITLESS COMPETITION.
Capital Now Interested in the Fight
Between the Producer and
Consumer.
The powder trust on the Pacific Coast
will shortly be broken if the plans of
those opposed to it do not fail. An at
tempt will be made to disrupt the com
bine, and the indications are that it
will succeed. The greater part of the
output of the powder factories on the
coast is bought by local miners. For
a time, when the rival powder com
panies were fighting one another, the
miners had no cause for complaint The
powder necessary for blasting pur
poses could be bought by them at
prices that gave to the manufacturers
but small profit.
Among the manufacturers It was a
matter of cutting prices to get trade,
and the miners received the benefit of
their rivalry. After a time, it came to
the minds of the owners of the several
powder factories that the fight, if con
tinued, would mean a loss to all of
them. There were several meetings
held, and it was finally decided to quit
the fight and agree on a uniform price
for blasting and giant powder. While
the war was on the miners were bene
fited. When the combine was made
the miners found that they were ex
pected to pay what had been lost by the
manufacturers during the period of op
position.
The prices were raised about 25 per
cent, and it was then that those en
gaged in mining determined to battle
with the trust.
Within the past few days several
meetings have been held by mine own
ers and superintendents of mines, and
the determination arrived at to not
quietly submit to the combine. The
mining men found that they could In
terest capital In their fight, and it Is
their intention to have a new factory
established in this State.
They have agreed to enter into con
tracts with any company that will fur
nish them with giant powder at a rea
sonable price. None of the contracts
is to be for less than ten years nor
more than fifteen years. All the min
ers will ask is that powder be fur
nished them at reasonable rates. If
they do not succeed in getting a plant
of their own they will subscribe to
ward the establishment of one.
The powder manufacturers at pres
ent engaged in the business claim that
the trust was formed after they dis
covered that their competition in busi
ness caused them all to lose money.
They say that the combine would
never have been made had it not been
that self-preservation required it.
J. F. Nesmith, secretary of the Cali
fornia Powder Works, gave the fol
lowing explanation yesterday of the
advance in prices:
"Some time ago we advanced the
price of giant powder about 20 per
cent, and all other works on the coast
did the same thing, simply because we
were tired of manufacturing powder
for nothing, and decided to make a
little profit *ut of it. About three
years ago the various manufactories
began cutting rates until the matter
finally went so far that while we were
selling powder for just what it cost
us, the other concerns were selling it
for a trine less than the cost of the
manufacture. Of course this thing
could not go on forever, and we finally
decided to raise the price sufficiently
to make a safe profit which would in
sure us against loss by possible cas
ualties at our works.
"As far as any agreement between
the manufacturers is concerned it
amounts to Just this: If you go into
a business house of any kind in the
city and ask the price of a certain
commodity, then go out to another you
will find their prices practically the
same, although there may be no agree
ment between them. So it is with us.
If you visit the offices of the various
powder works in this city you will find
that fifty pounds of giant powder will
cost about the same in one place as an
other, and it was this way when the
rate war was on. Of course, we being
the largest works on the coast, gener
ally set the price, and whatever lead
we take will be almost unquestionably
followed by the others.
"I do not believe the prices wiU ad
vance any further, unless, of course,
there should be a heavy advance in the
price of raw material. Sulphur, for in
stance, recently took a Jump of about
20 per cent, but we did not advance our
prices any on that account, as it fluc
tuates very much and the next move
may be a corresponding drop. Should
the price continue high for a great
length of time, however, or should it
increase much we may be obliged to
slightly raise the prices. We very much
prefer to set a fair price and sell
the goods at that, as it is much more
convenient for us. There has been
no advance in the price of granulated
powders, nor is it at all probable that
there will be."
SOLEMNLY LAID TO REST.
Last Rites Performed Over the Body
of Miss Annie Gottlob.
Grief-stricken relatives and sorrowing
friends solemnly laid to rest the body of
the late Miss Annie Gottlob yesterday
morning in the Hills of Eternity Ceme
tery at San Mateo.
Just previous to the departure of thÂ«
funeral procession from her former
home at 863 Bush street, hundreds of
friends visited there to pay their respects
to the dead and take a last look at the
young and beloved face ere it was locked
for all eternity within its narrow con
fines in the grave.
Many floral tributes had been sent to
the home as marks of esteem from the
many friends who mourned the loss of
the dead woman as that of a sister.
Over the casket was thrown a pall con
sisting of gentle folds of smllax and
lilies of the valley. Surmounting this
beautiful covering was a tribute placed
there by her two brothers, consisting of
immense bunches of pink orchids and
maiden-hair fern.
The Rev. Jacob Voorsariger of the Tem
ple Emmanu-El conducted the religious
ceremony, delivering a beautiful tribute
In honor of the pure and exemplary life
of the deceased.

ADMISSIONS OF
THE DEFENDANT
Figel Had an Account With
the First National
Bank.
The Defense However States That
Embezzlement Charges Will
Be Lett for Proof.
Testimony of many descriptions was
given In the Figel case yesterday. One
witness would be called to speak of blood
stains and loud words, and again the
evidence would rest on checks, blank
books and receipts, for the purpose of
proving a motive for the alleged murder
following the louu words testified to.
General Barnes was rather late making
his appearance, as he had been called as
a witness in another department, but
when he took his seat by the side of the
defendant. Henry L. Smith, secretary of
the Board of Trade, was called to again
testify to the "Board of Trade" check for
$436 36. He was followed by Clarence M.
Post, a clerk in the employ of -xoffman,
Rothchild & Co., who testified that Figel
had been in the habit of opening letters
addressed to the firm, but always in the
presence of Isaac Hoffman, and that
other clerks in the employ of the firm
had been given the same privilege.
Joseph M. Rothchild, brother of Ed
ward S. Kothchild and a partner of At
torney Henry Ach, was next called. His
testimony touched upon business trans
actions here and there, and also reverted
to the keeping of an account by the de
fendant in the First National Bank, which
the witness stated was contrary to the
orders of the members of the firm. The
defense admitted that the defendant had
received moneys cnarged and nad deposit
ed them to his own account in the i irst
National Bank, but it was stated by
General Barnes t.-u... the offense of em
bezzlement would be left for proof. The
admission was accepted by the prosecu
tion, but it proceeded to show that Theo
dore Figel had received and misappro
priated the funds.
Henry Jacobs, a drayman, was then
called, and his testimony as to his having
seen Lauer, the drayman, on the even-
Ing of June 1 was twisted in with the
testimony on embezzlement charges and
allegations.
Just prior to the noon recess Attorney
Ach was placed on the stand, and at the
opening of the afternoon session the wit
ness was recalled. He went over an
interview he had with Theodore Figcl
concerning various checks which con
cerned the firm, and on which hinges
the charges of embezzlement. Eight
checks on the London, Paris and Ameri
can Bank, calling for from $1000 to $3000,
were spoken of tending to prove that the
defendant had drawn the checks for his
own use, and had afterward forged the
narre of Tssaac Hoffman on a receipt for
$.COO prior to the alleged murder for the
rurpos-e of diverting suspicion :"rom him
self. The cash books, etc., were r.hiced
in evidence and much testimony given
at the preliminary examination was
heard. There was no cross-examina
tion.
M. Zirker, a Merced merchant, told of
payments made to the firm of Hoffman,
Rothchild & Co., for $750 and $1300, and
that he had received full value for the
amounts. S. E. Cornell, also a clothier
of Merced, was called concerning a check
for $294 46 and the defense admitted that
the defendant had signed checks and re
ceipts and would continue to do so when
ever given a chance.
Isaac Geillert testified that he had re
ceived $1300 from Mr. Zirker and had
given him a receipt for it. Bernard Jo

seph was called to the stand, but ho
had not brought his books with him. It
was asked how long it would take to
get his book? and he said an hour. Gen
eral Barnes said: "He lives out on Sut
ter street by the gravoyard. where I wish
I was." The witness was excused, but
will be called this morning at 10 o'clock
to give testimony in regard to his busi-~
ness relations with the defendant. Th* K>
letter written by Isaac Hoffman, ad-^
dressed to "Dear Ed." was placed in evi
dence by the prosecution. Late in the
afternoon pieces of bone and bullets were
offered in evidence. After the jury had
been excused Judge Cook called the coun
sel for both prosecution and defense- and
said that as many witnesses giving tes
timony as to having received receipts
signed by the defendant had rome from
the country, some plan should be adopted
to hurry matters up. The idea waa
thought to be a good one and court ad
journed until 10 o'clock this rooming.
GOOD NEWS FOR FRUIT MEN.
A New Market to Be Opened for Cal-
ifornia's Products.
J. A. Filcher nf thÂ« State Board of
Trade was in high spirts yesterday. He
was just in receipt of a letter from Zu
rich, Switzerland, which contains good
news for the fruit growers of Califor
nia. The letter in question was from
the late United States Consul, Eugene
Germain, and announced that a Euro
pean market would be especially thrown
open this year for California fruits.
It is thought this will have the effect
of raising the price on those fruits
quoted, and in consequence there may
be a great deal of local speculation that will
tend to liven the home market. The let
ter informs the State board that the rul
ing prices of the European market will
govern all exportations. One particu
larly bright fact is that a demand will
be made for that class of fruit which
heretofore has not even been put upon
the market.
The letter is as follows:
ZURICH. Jan. 28, IS9B.
Secretary State Board of Trade. San Fran
cisco, Cal.â Dear Sir: Will you be kind enough
to call the attention of the California fruit
growers to the fact that I will have a market

rels; also for sun-dried and evaporated apples,
quarters and halves, unpeeled. uncored and un
seeded, also packed in barrels? I'pon receipt
of samples and quantities to be had. not less
than carload lots of 24.000 pounds, 1 wju name
Job prices on the ruiing market in that part
of Europe where these goods are wante-1.
I write at this early period to enable STOweni
to prepare and save what otherwise is usually
thrown away. If you have any means to com
municate this Information to the people r of
California. Oregon and Washington I wrtuM
respectfully, ptatps ConsuL
