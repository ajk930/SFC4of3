SCENE OF THE FIRST GREAT NAVAL BATTLE OF THE WAR.
The San Francisco Call
great naval battle thus far re
ceived is coming from Span
ish sources. This shows con
clusively that Manila has not
yet been taken by the Ameri
can forces and that the cable
lines are still under the con
trol of Spain.
From the fact that even
the advices received from
Madrid show that the Ameri
can warships fared best,
there is hardly any doubt
that when complete details
are obtainable it will be
learned that it was a crush
ing defeat for Spain.
Reports of the battle thus
far are coming in piecemeal.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MAY 2, 189 S.
During the two engage
ments that took place
Commodore Montijo, com
manding the Spanish fleet,
lost three of his largest
ships. His flagship, the
armored cruiser Maria
Reina Christina, and the
armored cruiser Castilla
were burned, and the
cruiser Don Juan de Aus
tria was blown up. Sev
eral other Spanish ves
sels were badly damaged.
Under the protection of the
guns of their fortifications the
Spanish warships opened fire
on the American fleet.
For several hours the har
bor resounded with the roar
of guns, the crashing of steel
timbers and the shrieks and
groans of the wounded
Thick clouds of smoke at
times almost obscured the
opposing fleets from each
other.
A well - directed shot
reached the iron cruiser
Don Juan de Austria, a
vessel of 1 100 tons. A ter
rific explosion followed
and the ship was blown
up.
All the time during the
first engagement the Ameri
can ships were under way,
their maneuvering being in
tended to render the marks
manship of Spanish gunners
less effective.
There was a heavy loss
of life among the Spanish.
Captain Cardase, com
manding the Maria Cris
tina, was killed.
Commodore Montijo, com
manding the fleet, shifted his
flag from the Maria Cristina
to the Isla de Cuba, a much
smaller steel protected
cruiser, just before the Cris
tina sank.
The blowing up of the Don
Juan de Austria was attended
by a great loss of life among
the crew, her commander
also being killed.
Commodore Dewey's
squadron, leaving Subig Bay,
a few miles from Manila,
PRICE FIVE CE^TS.
about 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, proceeded toward
Manila. Under the cover of
darkness he entered the har
bor of Manila, the batteries
located there announcing his
arrival.
Both fleets lined up for bat
tle at daybreak â about 5
o'clock this morning. The
guns of the American war
ships began firing on the
fortress of Cavite and the
arsenal of Manila.
The American squadron,
about 9 o'clock drew off
to the east side of the bay
and took refuge behind some
foreign vessels. The ships<
had evidently suffered con
siderable damage.
After they had made some
hasty repairs they returned
to the conflict. During this
engagement the guns of Ca
vite maintained a steadier
and stronger fire upon Com
modore Dewey's ships than
in the. first encounter, but the
American guns were bridged
with telling effect. As the
smoke lifted it was seen that
the flagship Maria Reina
Cristina was on fire. The

burned.
In the interval between the
two engagements Commo
dore Montijo moved his flag
from the Cristina to the
smaller cruiser Isla de Cuba.
To the fact that he made this
change he doubtless owes
his life.
The cruiser Castilla, next
to the flagship the largest
and most powerful of the
Spanish squadron, was also
burned. The cruiser Don
Antonio de Ulloa and the
Mindanao were also badly
damaged in the encounter.
That the American squad^
Ron received severe damage
in the encounter cannot be
doubted. Early reports had
it that five of Commodore
Dewey's fleet had been sunk.
Later advices from Madrid

have been able to ascertain
nothing more definite than
this, but I consider it highly
significant that the latest ad
vices I have received from
Â !yiadrid and Lisbon make.no
mention of an American be
ing destroyed. There were,
undoubtedly, heavy losses
in men on both sides.
One apparently trust
worthy report states that
the Spanish had 200 killed
and 400 wounded.
Trustworthy, details of the
American loss of life will
hardly be obtainable until
Commodore Dewey has

LISBON, May 1, 11 p.. m.â Reliable

SUFFERED
A CRUSHING
DEFEAT AT SEA.
LONDON, May I.â While it is quite
clear that the Spanish squadron has
suffered a crushing defeat, the dis
patches leave unclear the intensely in
teresting question whether the Ameri
can squadron has suffered material
damage.
All news thus far comes from Spanish
sources, but it seems evident that Com
modore Dewey has not captured Ma
nila. Unless he is able to make an
other attack and capture the town he
will be in an awkward position, hav
ing no base upon which to retire and
to refit.
Probably, therefore, the United States
squadron will be obliged to make for
San Francisco, as the entrance to Ma
nila Hay was heavily mined with tor
pedoes.
Commodore Dewey exhibited great
pluck and daring in making for the in
ner harbor. According to private ad
vices received from Madrid, the United
States cruisers Olympia, Raleigh and
two other vessels, the names of which
are not given, entered the harbor.
No dispatches give details as to the
vessels actually engaged on either side.
It appears to be incorrect that the
ships anchored behind the merchant
men on the east side of the bay. It
should be the west side. The probabil
ities point in the direction of the sec
ond engagement having occurred,
through the Spaniards trying to pre
vent the landing of the American
wounded.
Reliable details cannot be had until
I Commodore Dewey's squadron is able
to communicate with Hongkong. There
is, however, a suspicious frankness in
the Spanish dispatches that savors of
the intention to break unwelcome news
to the Spaniards. It is not likely,
however, that Commodore Dewey will
renew the attack.
WILL SOON
SEIZE THE
PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, May I.â So confident
are the officials of the seizure of the
Philippines by Commodore Dewey's
squadron that they ere talking to
night of the disposition to be made of
the islands.
There is no desire on the part of the
administration to permanently retain
the islands, but it is appreciated that
they will -be valuable as a base of sup
plies for the American ships, at least
until the close of the war.
It is possible that when a treaty of
peace is sigried the Philippines will be
an excellent thing to trade for some
other concession. The insurgents in
the islands would naturally object to
again being governed by Spain. The
withdrawal by the United States from
the Philippines would mean their im
mediate seizure by Japan or one of the
great European powers, and it is pos
sible that the insurgents may prefer to
live under the stars and stripes.
The final disposition of the Philip
pines, however, has not been deter
mined. For the present Commodore

AS REPORTED
BY A SPANISH
OFFICIAL
MADRID, May 1, 8 p. m.â The fol
lowing is the text of the o*..cial dis
patch from the Governor General of the
Philippines to the Minister of War,
General Correa, as to the engagement
off Manila:
"Last night, April 30, the batteries at
the entrance to the fort announced the
arrival of the enemy, forcing a passage
under the obscurity of the night. At
daybreak the enemy took up positions,
opening with a strong fire against Fort
Cavite and the arsenal. Our fleet en
gaged the enemy in a brilliant combat,
protected by the Cavite and Manila
forts. They obliged the enemy, with
heavy loss, to maneuver repeatedly.
At 9 o'clock the Americans took refuge
behind the foreign merchant shipping
on the east side of the bay. Our fleet,
considering the enemy's superiority,
naturally suffered a severe loss. The
Maria Cristina is on fire and another
ship, believed to be the Don Juan de
Austria, was blown up. There was con
siderable losb of life. Captain Cadarzo,
commanding the Maria Cristina, is
among the killed. I can not now give
further details. The spirit of the army,
navy and volunteers is excellent."

COMPLETE TRIUMPH
FOR AMERICAN TARS
WASHINGTON, May I.â The news from Manila, which is rendered even more significant
of a conclusive American victory because it came from Madrid, created the greatest excitement
here to-night. Crowds surrounded the bulletin boards, and foreign Embassadors and ladies in
evening dress jostled negro cab-drivers and street arabs in their eagerness to learn the full par
ticulars of the first engagements of the war. At the White House the President and Secretary
Alger read the news as it came in short bulletins over the private executive wire, taken off by
the skillful hand of veteran Operator Vbntg^Tiiry, who perform ?J a similar service for President
Lincoln during the War of the Rebellion. Secretary Long received the news at his house over
the telephone and bulletins sent from the newspaper offices. At n o'clock the President retired,
and Secretary Alger, after a call at the State, War and Navy building, went to his home. Up to
midnight no official confirmation of the Madrid dispatch had been received, but this is not looked
lor under forty-eight hours unless Admiral Dewey secures control of the cable at Manila, which
is supposed to be still in the hands of the Spanish. No doubt is expressed as to the accuracy of
the reports via Madrid, however, and it is thought that when official advices are received the
American victory will appear even more complete than now stated.
find it impossible to believe that the
Spanish squadron off Cavite has sus
tained if not a defeat at least a severe
check, and yet it is easy to see every
one believed some such news is con
cealed behind the guarded dispatches
received this afternoon by the Min
ister of War from Captain-General
August!. It needs little experience of
telegrams to arrive at the same conclu
sion. No one doubts that the Spanish
fought heroically. As said, the dis
patch affirms that they fell like
heroes at Trafalgar, but there is a
growing impression that now as then
all is lost save honor.
It was late this afternoon that the
news began to go around that the two
fleets had at last engaged in battle. At
first it was said Spain had won a de
cided victory. On every side and on
every corner small groups formed dis
cussing these reports with a satisfac
tion easily comprehensible. Then
doubts began to creep into the minds of
the people as the papers brought out
supplementary fly-sheets, each later
one giving a few more details, meager
enough in all conscience, but still
enough to show that victory, if victory
it was, had indeed been dearly bought.
Then the official cablegram to the
Minister of War became generally
known. It says that the American
squadron deployed before Cavite at
daybreak, that the Spanish ships main
tained a brilliant fight with the enemy
which suffered serious damage, and
finally had withdrawn to a western
portion of the bay, where it anchored
behind foreign merchant vessels.
From the conversations with a great
many people and Deputies it would ap
pear to be thin last detail that caused a
fear in the Spanish minds that in real
ity the American force had been left
master of the situation. It hardly ap
pears .probable that the enemy would
have been allowed to take up a position
quietly in the bay had the Spanish
ships been able to make any opposition.
The details that followed in a tele
gram only confirmed these fears. It
says the Spanish squadron being heav
ily overmatched, suffered heavily, two
vessels being lost, one of them, the
Cristina, the flagship, whose command
ing officer, Captain Louis Cadaro, was
killed.
MOUNTED GUARDS
ARE PATROLLING
MADRID'S STREETS
LONDON, May 2. â Dispatches from
Madrid dated 2:20 a. m., say the city
is now tranquil, although the mounted
guards are patrolling all the main
streets. *At the theaters, cafes and in
frc-nt of the newspaper offices last
evening the people loudly lamented
the unpreparedness of Manila to re
sist the American warships, whose at
tack had long been expected. The Ma
drid authorities are determined vigor
ously to suppress all street demonstra
tions.
MADRID, May 1, 11:30 p. m.â The
town is greatly excited by the serious
news from the Philippines, and there is
an immense crowd gathering in the
Calle de Sevilla. The civil guards on
hc-rseback were called out to preserve
order ajid all precautions have been
taken. There is much muttering, but
up to the present nothing more serious
has occurred.

K.t,jc w^&i, i"ia., May I.â Announcement that the Spanish fleet
has started on a direct course from Cape Verde to Porto Rico caused
no surprise among naval officers at Key West: It is what they have
expected. Only a few naval officers are now here. " Most of them are
those commanding the prize crews that have recently bÂ£en- brough.t
tnto port and have not yet rejoined the ships. None of them can be
quoted by name, but a senior lieutenant expressed -the views of a group
of five officers, and told me the views also of all the officers of the flset
when he said: "I have no doubt that the Spanish fleet is 'bound for- Porto

Schley's flying s-quadron is held at Hampton Roads for '.:th4- express

to sail with it. or will meet it at sea, and proceed in company. Many
officers believe, moreover, that Commodore Sehley will be reinforced
from Admiral Sampson's fleet at the proper time." '. ." â¢ '.
past 7 o'clock the bow of the Reina Ma
ria Cristina took fire and soon after
the poop was also burned. At 8 o'clock
j with my staff I went on board the Isla
|de Cuba. The Reina Maria Cristina
and the Castilla were then entirely en
veloped in flames.
"The other ships having been dam
aged retired into Baker Bay. Some
had to be sunk to prevent their falling
into the hands of the enemy The losses
are numerous, notably Captain Cardar

LONDON, May I.â The Madrid corre
spondent of the Financial News tele
graphs this morning as follows: The
Spanish Ministry of Marine claims a
victory for Spain, because the Ameri
cans were forced to retire behind the
merchantmen. Captain Cardarzo, in
command of the Reina Maria Cris
tina, went down with the ship. The j
Spaniards fought splendidly. There is
the greatest anxiety for further details.
OBSTACLES WHICH
DEWEY'S SQUADRON
HAD TO OVERCOME.
Commodore Dewey found the Span
ish Asiatic squadron inside the bay of
Manila under the guns of Cavite. This
fortress is situated on the eastern shore
of Manila Bay. It was the military
post and marine arsenal of Manila and
of the Spanish Orient, and it was the
objective of our squadron. Vessels
were built and repaired there. There
is a slip with a cradle 270 feet lons and
hydraulic power capable of drawing
2000 tons, also workshops containing
appliances of all kinds for repairs.
There is a dock for gunboats and a
large private dock. The town is well
fortified and stands on a low piece of
ground which forms a good harbor.
Cavite was a regularly constructed
fortress, mounting many guns, mostly
of an ancient type. A few pieces had
recently been emplaced â at least four â
some of them taken from armaments
of the Spanish fleet. There were also
some mortar batteries, mounting, per
haps, twenty of these guns. These de
fensive works caused our ships little
apprehension. From a distance of four
miles shots could be dropped into Ca
vite, and our squadron under way was
a target difficult to hit.
Manila lies about seven miles distant
from Cavite by water and fifteen by
land. It is surrounded by a cordon of
land batteries to prevent attacks by
insurgent forces, which have been hov
ering near, ready to capture the city
when the opportunity offered. The fleet
of Spain mounted altogether thirty
guns of a caliber greater than four and
a half inches, if no pieces had been re
moved, and the largest of these guns
was of six inches caliber. There were
thirteen of them. The largest caliber
mounted on board the United States
ships was eight inches, and there were
ten of them, and there were besides
forty-seven other pieces of four and
six inch caliber. The battery power of
our ships greatly outclassed that of
the Spanish ships. Further, only two
of the Spanish ships were protected â
the Isla de Cuba and the Isla de Lu
zon. All of ours were. Again, our ships
have all been built since 1888. of steel.
Some of Spain's ships, the Castilla, for
instance, were launched in 1881, and
were built of wood and of iron.
There are two islands at the en
trance of the Bay of Manila â Corre
gidor, or Meriveles, and Caballo â di
viding the entrance into two channels,
known respectively as the north and
south channels. The wings of the en
trance of the bay are fresh and the
water very deep and free ft dangers.
To blockade the bay or to bombard the
forts at the entrance the squadron
would have to keep under way. This

| fact explains the statement sent from
j Madrid that the Spaniards., forced Com
i modore Dewey's fleet to keep constant
j ly maneuvering.
Corregidor, the principal island, lies
only two miles from the north shore^
Of the mainland. As the water is vf'ry
deep â from thirty to forty fathomsâ
the tides run pretty strong. The south
ern entrance, between Caballo Island
and the mainland,, is five, miles across
and about twonty fathoms deep. The
channel between the two islands is
about 2400 feet wixie and mwe than
seven fathoms deep. In them all the
tide is strong, so our squadron proba
bly was not bothered by submarine
mines.
Corregidor is 640 feet high and Ca
ballo 420 feet. Neither place, however,
nor the salient points oh the mainland
opposite, had any mudern fortifica
tions. At least two nindern guns., and
perhaps four, have be,en mounted on
Corregidor and Caballo.
After forcing the entranceto the bay
the squadron had its hard work before
it. Cavite must be taken.
Manila is now at the mercy of mir
flent. While the entrance of the bay is
high and covered with vegetation, the
shores at its head are low, marshy and
intersected by numerous small rivers.
The city lies about twenty-five mil^s
from the entrance, Cavite being on the
southeast side. Admiral Dewey a
fleet steamed slowly so as to reach the
fighting grounds in condition to carry
on the contest for a couple of weeks.
Upon his arrival on Saturday night >t
made a reconnaisance and was ready
to begin the attack this morning.

GALLANT RECORD.
Rear Admiral George Dewey, the gal
lant commander of the Asiatic squad
ron which has added iuster to Ameri
ca's glorious naval history by its bril
liant victory over the Spanish fleet in
the harbor of Manila, is a son of the
Green Mountain State, whence he was
appointed to the United States Naval
Academy in 1854. He participated in
many of the most important naval en
gagements during 1861-65, being com
missioned as lieutenant Anril 19, 1861,
lieutenant commander four years later
and commander April 13. 1872. Hd was
promoted to a : captaincy in 1884, and
for three years, beginning in 188!j, com
manded the Pemsacola, the flagship of
the European station. In 1889 he be
came chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment and Recruiting, with the rank of
commodore, and in 1893 was made a
member of the Lighthouse Board. His
last important duty prior to hia ap
pointment to the Chjna station was
that of chief of the Bureau of lard 3
and Docks. . It is but a few months
since he succeeded to the command or
the Asiatic squadron. To-day his praise
is sung wherever the starry banner
kisses the free winds. He has achieved
enduring fame by his. signal triumph at
Manila, which means- the downfall of
Castilian power in. the; rich Philippine
Islands and a most crushing blow *<,
Spain at the outset of a war in which
the buccaneer monarchy of Europe is
doomed to speedy and terrible defeat
at the hands of the giant young repub-:
lie which will thus sweep the last ves
tige of old-%vorld despotism from tne
Western Hemisphere.
On his last visit to this harbor Rear
Admiral Dewey was discussing with
friends the subject of the modern bat
tle-ship "The construction of naval
fighting machines has reached this
point," said the admiral: "You have got
to annihilate the enemy or go to the
bottom." In the light of the news from
Manila Bay it would seem .that Admi
ral Dewey was not very fa-r astray in
his convictions..A. OOROTXI 3 OF THE HEROES OF THE BATTLE IIST 2s/Lj&3<TTT-iJÂ± BAY.

Several instances have occurred In
the vicinity of Washington where sus
pected spies have been arrested. Dur
ing the past week two Spaniards were
known to be attempting to gain infor
mation concerning mines in the Poto
mac. The authorities were soon aware
of their Intentions, and before they
could get any information the neces
sary steps were taken to get them out
of the country- The greatest precau
tion is being observed in guarding puÃ
lic buildings. At all hours the en
trances are closely watched and no one
is permitted to go in a building unless
known. Secret service men are con
stantly upon watch on the exterior of
buildings, in order to be sure that no
one approaches with any high explo
sives.
The President, while taking his dalty
walk, is always followed at a safe dis
tance by a guard of one man. This is
contrary to his wishes, an- only out of
regard for Mrs. McKinley's wishes.
Not only are separate precautions
taken to guard against the spies of
Spain, but the Postoffice Department is
also being extremely careful in regard
to all mail addressed to Spaniards in
this country. The department has been
able to locate nearly all Spanish resi
dents still in the United States, and is
keeping the closest watch upon their
movements. In this way all communi
cation between spies has 1 een stopped,
and the department has been able to
locate many Sp; liards attempting to
gain information.
The order recently issued in the War
Department prohibiting clerks from
giving information to representatives
of the press was principally due to a
fear that Spain had hirelings who
claimed to newspaper men.
Owing to these precautions, and many
others which Chief Wilkie has taken,
it is now practically impossible for
Spain to gain information concerning
the defenses of the United States.

The absence of any specific mention
of supposed casualties on the American
ships in the censored reports from Spain
indicate that the damage to the Ameri
can ships could not have been very
great. That was the impression of all
the gentlemen who were with the Pres
ident to-night.
Attorney-General Griggs said he was
very much gratified with the report,
even if it does come from Spanish
sources, and he expressed the hope that
it would be even more gratifying when
v.c received the American version of the
battle.
He said it would probably take two
or three days to get the official reports
from Commodore Dewey, as he will be
obliged to send his report by way of the
nearest friendly port.
Secretary Alger said that the Spanish
reports indicate a decided victory for
the American fleet,, and the news will
cause great rejoicing throughout the
land.

the American fleet. Mr. Depew de
clared that the news, although from
Spanish sources, is glorious and will
send a thrill of joy to every American
heart.
In the absence of any official infor
mation on the subject the President re
frained from making public any state
ment to-night, but he undoubtedly
joined in the spirit of rejoicing: which
prevailed among the guests. The con
ference at the White House terminated
about half-past 10 o'clock, and it was
understood that no additional lierht
could be thrown upon the subject until
an account of the conflict is received. It
is understood that Dr. Depew is here
to urge the President to appoint Gen
eral Fitzgerald a brigadier general of
volunteers. During his visit to the
White House to-night he took occasion
to discuss the matter with the President
and Secretary Alger.
Great excitement prevails among na
val officers. All consider that a deci
sive victory has been won by the Amer
ican fleet. Assistant Secretary Roose
velt, when shown a copy of the dispatch
from Madrid, was much excited. He
said: "This dispatch shows nothing but
a complete and glorious victory for the
American fleet. The Spaniards have
surely been wiped out. This, ' he said,
''is the best news I have heard for a
long time, as it means a great victory
for American seamen, and will go down
to history as such."
Captain Crowninshield. chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, ?lso has express
ed himself as greatly satisfied with the
Madrid dispatch and agreed in every
particular with Mr. Roosevelt in think
ing that the engagement was a complete
victory for the United States fleet. He
informed me that such word from
Madrid could mean nothing but a vic
tory for Commodore Dewey.
Commander' F. W. Dickens, assistant
chief of the Bureau of Navigation, was
greatly pleased when I showed him a
copy of the Madrid dispatch, and he
said that every word shows that the
United States vessels had covered them
selves with glory. When I called on
Captain Dickens he was entertaining a
large company of army and navy
friends, who ail joined in praise for the
SPANISHâ Admiral Montijo.
victory won by the American fleet.
Commodore Dewey was the hero of
the hour. There is no doubt expressed
by any one in the navy that the engage
ment was a complete and. glorious vic
tory for the American sailors.
Â«
SPAIN MUST
NOW GIVE UP
THE FIGHT
WASHINGTON, May I.â Washington
is rejoiced to-night. Not since the dark
days of the great civil conflict have the
people of this city been so profoundly
moved by war news as they were this
evening.
The first battle of the Spanish-Amer
ican war has been fought and the vic
tory lies with Admiral Dewey's squad
ron under the stars and stripes.
That was enough to set the people of
Washington almost in a frenzy of en
thusiastic rejoicing. For days they, Vn
common with the people throughout,
the country, have been waiting news
from the Philippines, as everything
pointed to a battle at Manila that
might be a decisive conflict of the war.
When the news came indicating a great
victory for the American squadron the
enthusiasm of the people was let loose
and the streets have rung with cheers
throughout the night.
The first news of the battle received
in Washington came in a brief cable
gram to the Associated Press from Ma
drid about 8 o'clock this evening. As
the night wore on, the cable continued
to sing the news of victory for the
squadron of Admiral Dewey, and the
interest grew into tremendous excite
ment.
: Ordinarily Washington is the quietest
of cities on Sunday, but as bulletin af
ter bulletin was posted in front of the
newspaper offices, each successive one
conveying information more grratifyic*:
than its predecessors, the crowds in the
streets v became r uproarious. Good, as
well as : bad news, spreads rapidly, I and
by 10 o'clock the streets were crowded
with people, all discussing the one ex
citing .. topic of the â¢ hour. ; ' Hundreds
gathered in front of the bulletin boards
and every scintilla of newsâ and it was
all gloriousâ was received with ; enthu
siastic ; cheers. While victory had been
expected, the news of It â coming, as It
did, from Spanish sourcesâ gave vent to
thÂ» patriotism of the people/ which has j
... - .-,â  ;- ; _ â â  ;. â¦ /;_â  :::_:.., :_.'. â -. .â¢â â¢.
been pent up for days. It was a spon
taneous outburst of patriotic feeling
that scarcely know bounds. Ad
miral Dewey's name was on every lip
and his praises were sung in the re
joicings of the people.
Thus far no official advices have been
received by the Governmer* but the
press dispatches were transmitted to
the President and officials of the Ad
ministration as rapidly as they were
received.
Army and navy circles, after mani
festing throughout the day the great
est eagerness for news from the Philip
pines, received with great satisfaction
the news of the victory. Their satis
faction at the i.efeat of the Spanish has
been strengthened by the news coming
from Madrid and they were unreserved
in expressing their gratification upon
the signal triumph of the American
forces.
At the Army and Navy Club, a large'
company was gathered and read and
commented v, on the story of the en
gagements, as it was presented in the
bulletins of the press. At the club,
down town, at their rooms, and wher
ever seen, the officers were freely giv
ing vent to the pleasure they felt at the
news and declaring the confidence
which they had entertained throughout
that the American ships, their officers
and men would demonstrate their su
periority over the Spanish fleet in the
Philippine waters.
The absence of any statement of
specific injury to the American vessels
in the Madrid advices was construed as
convincing indication that they had not
suffered appreciable injury, and this
was especially pieasing to the naval
students of tho news.
Not only was the preservation of the
American ships and men considered In
itself a happy outcome, but was com
mented upon as Indicating clearly that
Admiral Dewey and his associate of
ficers and men under their command
had discharged splendidly their several
duties in directing and executing the
fight.
In this connection it was pointed out
as little less than marvelous that the
American squadron escaped without
severe injury, because, notwithstanding
the disparity in the naval forces, the
Spanish fleet, assisted by the shore bat
teries, should have, been able to inflict
severe damage. Its failure to do so was
accountable only upon the hypothesis
of perfect and swift work by the Amer
ican squadron.
An opinion freely expressed to-night
by naval officers is that the very de
cisive victory of Admiral Dewey's fleet
will mean probably an early end to the
war without further naval battles of
Importance. The American fleet, it is
suggested, is now supreme in the wa
ters of Spain's Pacific possession and
indications were strongly toward the
slipping of the Thilippines from her
control.
It was said that only by quickly
yielding to our demands, in Cuba, could
this loss possibly be averted. Spain,
it was argued, was confronted with a
situation which promised naught save
disaster in case she elected to force
more fighting. The superiority of our
fleet had been demonstrated in the
Pacific, and the same, it is con
tended, would be inevitable in the At
lantic in case the clash comes. From
whatever point of view considered the
policy of more fighting on the part of
Spain promises nothing but more Span
ish misfortune. Navy officers think this
view must prevail with the Spanish
Government and believes an end of the
war on the basis of Cuban independ
ence is to follow soon, and that, too,
without further notable opportunity for
the American navy to prove its power
and distinguish itself.
It is to be not unlikely that the rep
resentations will indicate that, since
Spain's honor has been satisfied by a
conflict, Spain can now yield to the in
evitable and accept the good offices of
the powers to bring about an adjust
ment. In the dispatches from Madrid
the statement was made that Admiral
Dewey effected a landing on the west
side of Manila Bay for the men of his
fleet who were wounded in the engage
ments.
It was suggested in official circles
that this landing had a two-fold pur
pose. It was not only that the wounded
might have the better care than they
could receive on ship board, in the face

t of other probable engagements, but also
I to carry out what was known to be Ad
miral Dewey's purpose to effect a junc
tion with the insurgents as soon as pos
: sible. The insurgent forces practically
surround Manila on both sides of the
i city, and with the intention of securing
i control of Manila as soon as possible
Admiral Dewey was to obtain a foot
ing on the island at the earliest practl
â  cable moment. As soon as the junction
; of the American and insurgent forcesâ
j the one on the sÂ«a and the other on the
I landâ is effected a demand is likely to
| be made for the surrender of the city,
| and, in the event of refusal, a com
! bined attack would be made on it. The
I result of such attack, in the absence of
j a Spanish fleet and effective shore bat-
I teries, seems a foregone conclusion.
No news of a definite character la
; given concerning the loss sustained by
j Admiral Dewey's squadron, and it Is
scarcely likely, in the opinion of ex
: perts of the navy, that authentic infor- 1
I mation will be received until Admiral
' Dewey has an opportunity to eommuni-
I cate officially with the department. It
is regarded as probable that immedt-
ately after the engagements of to-day
Admiral Dewey sent the revenue cutter,
McCulloch back to Hongkong with dis

KEY WEST, Fla., May I.â As has
been told in the Herald enough arms |
and ammunition have been found al
ready in the cargo of the steamer Pan
ama, which was captured by the light
house tender Mangrove, to surely con
demn her. I learned to-day that in ad_- I
dttion to the Mauser rifles taken from j
her magazines by Deputy United States
Marshal Atchison, a large consignment
of machetes was found aboard her, pre
sumably for use of young Spaniards
who were enrolled as passengers on the
Panama, and are now held here as pris
oners of war.
A part of the Spanish silver taken on
the coast steamer Ambroisio Bolivar
was officially counted to-day by United
States Marshal John F. Horr, United
States District Attorney Stripling and
the Prize Commissioners, Judges
Phipps, Julius Otto and Commander J.
K. Winn, United States navy, retired.
About $50,000 worth of Spanish silver
was counted. It is still thought the
completion of the task will show the
cargo to amount to $60,000 or more.
Deputy Marshal Atchison has re
moved the breeches from the 14
pounder.
Systematic search, inventory and ap
praisement of the cargoes of several
prizes of war probably will be made to
morrow. It is likely that the Prize
Commissioners may get to work for
mally also. They will take up first the
cases of the schooners and smaller ves
sels, disposing of the steamships after
ward.

Army.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, Fla., May I.â There was
a rush of Cubans here to-day to join
; the regiment being organized by Gen
j eral Figuredo at Tampa to engage in
the war. Early in the forenoon, while
the streets were crowded with church
| goers, a dense crowd gathered at the
j entrance of San Carlos Hall on Duval
I street, where the notice that recruits
I were being enlisted was posted. As
I soon as the doors were thrown open
; the hall was filled by volunteers eager
!to enlist. The name, "age and occupa
tion of each applicant were taken.
It soon became necessary for the re
cruiting clerk to announce that no
' more married men or single men who
' have a family depending on them for
support would be accepted. More than
' 100 men anxious to fight for Cuba were
rejected on this account, much to their
: disappointment.
Some of General Figuredo's soldiers
i are extremely youthful in appearance,
but they are of good material and ca
pable of handling the rifles Uncle Sam
; will put into their hands. The oldest
; man enrolled was Manuel Garcia, aged
! 46. He is a cousin of General Garcia,
j and fought against Spain in the ten
year war.
A full quota for Key West in the reg
iment to be raised is less than 300, and
it is likely the number will be secured
to-day. The promptness of the Cubans
here to respond to the call to arms and
the eagerness displayed disproves the
assertions about the lack of martial
patriotism on their part. Knowing
that the hardships of a summer cam
paign in Cuba are ahead, they seem not
' only willing but anxious to serve, if
, arms and equipments are supplied.

ened Point
Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, May I.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: While
preparing plans for meeting Spain's
fleet, now en route to We stern waters,
officials have not forgotten to take pre
cautions for the protection of Ameri
can ports. Primarily the defense of
the coast will rest upon the navy and
the mosquito fleet, and the shore forti
fications will be secondary defenses
which Spain will have to overcome in
order to commit damage upon Ameri
can life and property.
Commodore J. A. Howell, com
mander-in-chief of the northern patrol
squadron, is collecting his fleet in New
England waters, and an armor-clad
squadron will be stationed at some
point between Key West and Hampton
Roads, from where it can be dispatched
to defend Cuban blockaders or a north
ern port, or make an offensive move
without serious inconvenience or delay.
On account of the conditions of the
fortifications of New England cities.
Secretary Long has deemed tt expedient
for Commodore Howell to make Bos
ton his headquarters for the present.
Commodore Howell's command now
consists of the cruisers San Francisco
and New Orleans and the ram Katah
din, and it will be re-enforced by Tues
day or Wednesday by the auxiliary
cruisers Yankee, Prairie, Dixie and
Yosemite, which have been converted
and armed at Newport News. The Min
neapolis and Columbia, which are on
scouting duty in New England waters,
may be ordered elsewhere when Com
modore Howell's entire force is assem
bled. Besides this fleet the navy has
the war-time monitor Catskill, under
command of Lieutenant M. E. Hall, at
Gloucester, Mass.. and the monitor Le
high at Boston. The Governor of Maine
has sent a detachment of men to man
the monitor Montauk, which will be
taken to Portland for defense of that
city.
So far as New York is concerned, it
is proposed by the department to
hasten the work of establishing a mos
quito fleet at this point, and this expe
dition will apply to stationing vessels
at other points along the coast.
By the aid of the coast defense signal
system the authorities say that as soon
as it becomes evident that a fleet is
heading toward New York, as can be
quickly learned, orders would be tele
graphed to Commodore Howell and to
Rear Admiral Sampson to hasten at
once to its relief, and before any dam
age could be done by the enemy it
would find itself confronted by a strong
squadron. The war-time monitors Na
hant and Jason are designed for the de
fense of New York.
On the Pacific Coast Rear Admiral
Miller has under his command quite an
effective flotilla of vessels, ample to
protect Pacific Coast cities from depre
dations by privateers. The monitor M<>
nadnock is at Puget Sound, the monitor
Monterey at San Francisco, the gun
boat Bennington at Honolulu. The crui
ser Alert, the revenue cutters Grant.
Corwin, Rush and Perry, the converted
tugs Iroquois, Vigilant and Active and
the Fish Commission vessel Albatross
are also doing coast duty.

KEY WEST, Fla., May I.â General
Emilio Nunez, the noted Cuban leader,
arrived here to-day on his way to meet
Admiral Sampson. He comes on anira
poi-tant mission and probably will be
sent out to the fleet to-night on one of
the torpedo-boats. General Nunez is
anxious to reach the fleet as soon as
possible. He is accompanied by
Colonels Baldamino Acosta and Elesio
Cartaya, of his staff.
General Nunez is reticent as to his
future movements, but Intimates a de
sire to consult Admiral Sampson and
to reach Gomez in the interior. He
probably will land in the night on the
coast of Cuba. His staff officers will
accompany him. Senor Jose d'Armasa,

6pecial Dispatch to Tho C*IL
NEW YORK, May I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Spain has
hastened American action in reducing
a Cuban port for use as a base of op
erations by the dispatch of her fleet to
western watera.
In order to make the path clear for
the expedition which will leave the
United States for the island during the
present week the ships of the North
Atlantic squadron will probably cease
the desultory firing which they have
been engaging in for some days and
will at once put into operation a plan
of campaign agreed upon.
As soon as the port desired as a base
is taken it is practically certain that an
armorclad fleet, which has been under
such serious consideration by the Na
val War Board, will be formed, prepar
atory to hostile action against Spanish
men-of-war.
I have it from a reliable source that
the Naval War Board has been con
sidering a proposition to make a coun
ter play in the game of war with Spain,
which Involves the dispatch of a force
against the Canary Islands. I can::ot
learn that it has been definitely deter
mined to put this proposition into ef
fect. What has been done, however,
has been to dispatch auxiliary cruisers
to Porto Rican waters, and they will
partol between that island and Cape
Verde and the Canary Islands.
As soon as the scouts ascertain the
position of Spanish men-of-war they
will, as the Herald has stated, hasten
to the nearest cable station and advise
the Navy Department what they have
learned. So far as the proposition to
take one of the Canary Islands is con
cerned, it has been pointed out by
members of the board that this had
better be deferred until the Spanish
fleet is destroyed, as operations against
those Spanish possessions would neces
sitate the withdrawal of some of the
armored ships of the North Atlantic
and flying squadrons. This suggestion
has been followed by a proposition to
send some of the lighter cruisers to the
Canaries and to have them engage the
Spanish force there, and this may be
done.
In the meantime officials are concern
ing themselves with the Spanish fleet
and steps which should be taken to
meet it. An economical speed of four
armored cruisers is ten knots, and if
the fleet should move at that speed
at least ten days would be occupied in
making the voyage. As there Is an
ample supply of coal at San Juan, ves
sels can go et a higher rate, and at
fifteen knots would reach Porto Rico
next Friday.
In view of this fact, naval officials
are counseling haste in the action of
tho North Atlantic squadron against a
Cuban port, so that a Junction of the
amored ships of that force with those
of the flying squadron can take place
at once.
It is considered possible by the of
ficials that the Spanish forces may be
on their way to the vicinity of Barba
docs. where they will await the coming
of the battleship Oregon and the gun
boat Marietta. It was pointed out to
day that if Spain suffers defeat in the
Philippines she would obtain a re
actionary effect by bagging American
men-of-war on their way to Key West.
Carefully prepared instructions have
been cabled to Captain Clarke, com
manding the Oregon, to take a course
which will insure his arrival at Key
West without meeting Spanish men-of
war.
It is expected that the Oregon and
Marietta are now coaling at Rio Jan
eiro and that they will resume their
voyage by Tuesday next.
TOO MANY VOLUNTEERS
HAVE BEEN REJECTED.
Navy Department Orders That the
Rigidity of Enlistment Regu-
lations Be Relaxed.
PHILADELPHIA, May I.â An order
from the navy has been received at
Cramps' shipyard by the officers who
have charge of the enlistment of vol
unteers in the naval service directing
that the rigidity of the regulations be
relaxed in order that recruits for the
St. Paul and other auxiliary cruisers
may be more easily brought into the
service. So many men have been re
jected because of trivial physical de
fects, but who are nevertheless desir
able additions to the service, that the
relaxation of this rule was found nec
essary. It is understood, however,
that the new rule applies only to volun
teers and that the naval regulations
governing the enlistment of regular
seamen will be strictly adhered to.
The St. Paul will sail from Cramps'
shipyard on Wednesday next. She has
only 3000 tons of coal supply in her
bunkers now and will sail "light" in or
der to get safely over the shoal spots in
the Delaware River. At Deep Water
Point the St. Paul will be joined by four
coal barges, and she will then receive
the balance of her coal supply.

In striking contrast to the above saa
case Is. that of Mrs. B. Hardin', -3.959 6er-
mantown Avenue, Philadelphia.. Pa., wife
of the Clerk of fhe Board of K/Jucatiom.
who says: "For thirty- years I. suffered
with sick tieada-he, [which appeared in
attacks of severe pain, so intertse. that 1
was obliged to remain in bed "for days
at a time. These attacks appeared al- -
most every week, and at no tjtne did I
ever receive relief, -although I consulted
the most skilled physicians In, the city.
The headaches seemed to wear them-
selves out and then commence anew. At
last I was induced to try- Munyon'Ji
Headache Cure. The relief "was magical
and almost instantaneous. I followed up
the treatment an'l was completely curea
âfor three years have passed and I havq M
had no return of the headaches. I have
recommended Munyon's Remedies to. a
number of my friends, and I- have re-
ceived their moat sincere thanks for
many worderful cures that hav^ been ac-
complished by these little pellets."
Professor Munyon has a separate spe-
cific for each disease, the only logical

Oakland Dropped a Hard
Game to the Sacra

Replete With Hard Hitting and Errors
That Bordered on the Sen

BY JOE CORBETT.
The first game played under the auspices
of the new Pacific Coast League at Cen

every way, save the game, a nig success.
The weather, which in the forenooon was
very threatening, undoubtedly prevented
a great many admirers of the Oakland-

JEFFRIES DISCUSSES WAR AND PUGILISM.
Thinks Sharkey's Only Chance for a Fight After Friday Night
Will Be With the Spaniards.
"Yes, I read what Sharkey had to say about his anxienty to re-enter the navy and fight for his adopted
country, and it reflects great credit on his patriotism. Moreover, I am of the opinion that after next Friday night
that is about the only kind of a fight Sharkey will be able to take on." r
Big Jim Jeffries had concluded his morning's work at the Reliance Club, and was about to take a drive down the
San Leandro road with his handler, Jim Delaney, when he was asked to express himself about Sharkey's patriotic -
outburst. â¢ ,
From the reply it was easy to form an opinion as to Jeffries' views on the outcome of next Friday night s
battle. His views, 'it is needless to say, are shared in to the fullest extent by Delaney, who says he never was so
confident of his man getting the referee's decision as he is in the present instance,
Jeffries had put In an unusually trying half day's work yesterday, in order to take a rest during the afternoon â 
and enjoy the delightful day. It is astonishing the amount of exercise the big fellow can stand, but he says he is
used to It, owing to the long hours he put in when working at his trade. He is strong as an ox now, but he will â 
keep right on with his work until the day of his battle.
Delaney laughs, and Jeffries smiles grimley, whÂ»nevor Sharkey's estimate on the fight Is mentioned. The sailor, â 
It is affirmed, has an idea that Jeffries has small liking for punishment, and that two or three stiff punches will dis
courage him. Delaney says his protege thrives on such nourishment and will take all Sharkey can give him and ask
for more.
Jeffries seemed inclined to regard his opponent's defl to Weyler's cohorts as something in the nature of a bluff,
and thought Sharkey would have little inclination to re-enter the naval bervice as long as he could make a showing

"However, if he means what he says," concluded Jeffries, "I honor him for his sentiment. But he need not run â¢
away with the Idea that he is the only man in the profession who is willing to go up against the Spaniards. If my
services are needed I, too, am ready to enlist, and I want it understood right here that I do my fighting on land.
Sharkey can have all the naval glory he wants, but if I am called upon I will take my chances with the army."
Then Jeffries clambered into his buggy and started off for an afternoon's recreation.

j that the crowd was big, good natured,
very enthusiastic and at all times cheer

! was but natural in view of the great rep
i utation held by that gilt edge aggrega
j tion from Sacramento, who took another
j scalp yesterday in a game replete with
I hard hitting and errors bordering on the
: sensational. During the preliminary
1 practice it was almost impossible to say
which team was to come out victorious.
I They both went into their work with a
; will, displaying more "ginger" than has
! been witnessed at Central Park this sea
j son. From appearances it struck one,
and very forcibly, as if the game was to
be the kind that is never won until the
last man is out, but this idea was quickly
done away with in the first inning, when
the Gilt Kdges. through the kindness of
Mr. Hardie, scored three runs. The game
itself was by no means a bad game, al
though errors and base hits were plenti
ful. Oakland's rally in the sixth inning,
when they lit on to Harvey, who seemed
to be afflicted with a "chronic state of un
easiness" when he saw those hits go tear
ing through and over the infield in every
direction, gave those present an oppor
tunity to cut loose, and they did so with
a vengeance. Harvey's antics during
this bombardment and after were most
peculiar. The crowd had him going good,
and after Oakland had rolled up five runs
gave him a laugh that no doubt will be
remembered for some time to come. He
did not like it a bit, and for some unac
countable reason kept up a continual
"hurrah," which was most surprising to
many persons, as he was considered the
"silent" man of the league.
His support was excellent in compari

Ditched a fairly good game, considering
the many rank errors made behind him.
He was admirably assisted in his work
by Sullivan, whose debut was a glorious
success his battery being one of the feat
ures of the game, Oakland, however, was
clearly outplayed, both at bat and in the
field Their many errors, of Schmeer and
Hardie were very costly, coming as they
did always at critical stages. They
batted well, bunching their hits in the
sixth and eighth, and had they put up

game, his running catch of a high foul j
over the third base bleachers brought j
the stands downs. Tt is difficult to say
how the game might have terminated had
the Oaklands played better in the field

The features of the game were Hardies
drive over the clubhouse for a home run,
and the poor fielding of the Oaklands.

ONE FOR BUNKER.
FRESNO, May I.â To-day's ball game
between San Francisco and Fresno
brought out about 1000 people. The visit
ing team defeated the local nine by a
score of 12 to 11. The feature of the game
was the, raising of the American flag with
military pomp. Companies C and - F of
the National Guard, and also the recruits,
forming a separate company, together
with the regimental drum corps,
marched from the armory to the grounds,
arriving at the fifth inning. The flag was
raised by a detachment of three privates
under command , of Colonel J. ID. - Jones.
The people made an enthusiastic demon
stration and when three cheers were pro
posed for the colors all joined in.
The game was not a good exhibition of
ball playing, as both sides filled up the
error column pretty well, but it was In
teresting on account of the closeness of
the score, and several brilliant plays were
made to offset the fumbles. The eighth
inning proved disastrous to both pitchers.
Tawney, Fresno's Eastern twirler, did
good work until that time, when the visi
tors bunched their hits, making eight
safe ones and scoring four times. Eagan,
for San Francisco, also went to pieces in
that inning, and five runs were made by
the home team. He was relieved in the
ninth by Murphy. One of the features
was the shortstop work of Carl Krug
for San Francisco. He accepted eight
difficult chances and only one error was
marked against him. Ferguson, for Fres
no made two grand stand put outs in
loft field, while Courtney, Moore and
Snyder did good work, although the last
named hardly came up to expectations.

OUTPLAYED BY STOCKTON.
The Athletics Put Up a Good
Game, but Suffer Defeat.
STOCKTON, May I.â The Athletics lost
to Stockton to-day by a score of 9 to 8.
The losers had nothing to be ashamed of,
as they put up the prettiest game of the
season. They were simply borne down
by the clever field work of Stockton. The
batting was heavy by both clubs, but
Stockton had the advantage by bunching
its hits. The game was in doubt up to
the last inning, when great excitement
prevailed among the rooters in the grand
stand and on the bleachers. The official

Why Spain Lost Her Power.
Reverend Frank S. Ford preached at
the First Christian Church last night on
Spain. His text was from Malachi iii., 18:
"Discern between the righeous and the
wicked, between him that serveth God
and him that serveth Him not."
The speaker traced what he termed the
rise and fall of Spa?in, moralizing to the
effect that Catholicism was responsible
for the downfall of the nation. He said
that Philip II was responsible for a great
part of the downfall of Spain, for he
resuscitated the Inquisition and did all in
his power to propagate the Catholic re
ligion, saying he would rather extermin
ate his subjects than have them heretics.
In spite of all this Luther obtained a
hold "in the country and Bibles existed in
the kingdom, abounding in the homes of
many educated Castilians.

COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS SETTLING.
' I 'HE feature of the week in Wall street was the
marked recovery in the tone of the markets
* toward the close of the week. This buoyancy
was-due to the inauguration of a bull campaign based
on the thus far successful prosecution of the war
against Spain. There was no important opposition
to the rise, and prices moved up easily, without, how
ever, any especial activity. The public were not in
it, and it was a matter almost purely between the reg
ular operators of the street. As The Call's financial
report put it: "The main consideration was the satis
faction felt over tiie excellent gunnery of the United
States ships at Matanzas and in pursuit of prizes and
the ineffective efforts of the Spanish gunners. The
skill thus demonstrated imparts a strong conviction
as to the superiority of the United States forces.
Early intelligence is also confident of a naval victory
over the Spaniards off the Philippines." All standard
bonds, both Government and railroad, were strong
and in good demand. The American finr.nciers evi
dently have no doubt as to the eventual victory of the
.national arms. For that matter nobody else in the
country has, either.
General trade, while exhibiting considerable of the
uncertainty remarked a week ago, is beginning to as
sume more definite lines, as was then predicted. The
woolen manufacturers are reporting a larger business,
chiefly on account of the heavy Government orders.
The same may be said of hides and leather, both of
which are advancing again in the East The con
sumption of iron is still the largest ever known, and
many orders are remaining unfilled. The phenom
enal advance in wheat has carried with it a corre
â â¢ sponding rise in other cereals and flour, while pork
products- have also gone up. In fact, the war is stim
ulating trade in those lines which are called upon to
supply the land and naval forces of the country.
How far the rise will extend, and what other articles
will be indirectly affected, it is impossible to say at
the moment. But that the general trade of the coun
try is on an active basis is shown by the continued
gain in bank clearings, those last week being 28 per
cent over the corresponding week in 1897, only two
of the larger cities â Portland, Me., and Providence â
showing" a decrease. Exports of wheat and corn from
the Atlantic ports are very heavy and considerably in
excess of last year. The country is likely to reap a
fine golden harvest from its grain production this
.year, as stocks are deficient all over the world. Busi-
ness failures in the United States last week number
245, a gain of 21 over the preceding week's total, and
compared with 244 in the corresponding week of 1897,
254 in 1896 and 206 in 1895.
The local markets, -which for some little time have
been quietj are again showing signs of improvement.
The slight recovery in dried fruits has already been
mentioned. As for the sensational advance in wheat
and its dependent cereals, flour and feedstuffs, in
cluding hay, that has been too prominently treated
during the past few days to need repetition here. The
next articles to advance will probably be hides and
leather, as things seem to be shaping in that direction.
The staple groceries are reported in good movement,
with higher prices for sugar and rice. The general
merchandise market is distinguished by advanced
quotations for several descriptions of oil, cement,
cordage and several minor articles. It is noteworthy
that no article of importance has declined of late.
The weather has ceased to be a factor in the mar
kets, except in a few scattering lines. The season is
over as far as the rain and the grain crops are con
cerned, and whether it rains or not is immaterial now.
The mischief has been done. Good rains would help
the fruit-growers, though they can get along without
them.
Diplomatic rumors in Europe seem to be emana
tions from the same source as the war rumors of the
yellow journals in this country, but are somewhat
more amusing. The latest announcement is that the
United States, Great Britain and Japan have formed
a dreibund with the intention of reorganizing the
world, and it would be hard for even a circus poster
.to beat that as an announcement of a stupendous
aggregation of mammoth wonders.
The rapidity with which the various States are fill
ing their quotas for the volunteer army is a new proof
that while we have commercial habits we are at heart
and in spirit a military people. It does not take much
to get the average American to leave his plow, his
yardstick or hammer to get his gun and follow the
flag.
The vehemence of the French press in denouncing
the United States for making war against Spain has
inclined the German press to take a second thought
on the subject and come over to our side. A strong
national prejudice is sometimes a very good substi
tute for reason
MANILA IS OURS.
r\ GLORIOUS victory marks the opening of hos
/ tilities between the United States and Spain in
1 * the Orient. Commodore Dewey and the gal
lant crew of his fleet have crushed the naval forces
of Spain in that portion of the globe with one blow.
The star-spangled banner floats triumphant in the
harbor of Manila and the city is ours.
The feat thus accomplished was one of the most
signal achievements of skill and daring in the history
of naval warfare. It was a stroke worthy of Farragut
or Nelson. The story even as told by the Spaniards
themselves is enough to thrill American hearts with
pride, and we need not wait for the full official records
of the battle to recognize that in Commodore Dewey
the nation has a new hero to add to the illustrious
galaxy that adorns the pages of its military and naval
annals.
Dewey with his fleet arrived off Manila at night.
He was far from his base of supplies and had no place
to turn for refuge if he should meet with defeat.
These considerations did not for a moment cause him
to hesitate. He wasted no time in reconnoitering or
taking counsel of his fears. In the darkness of night
he boldly entered the harbor, which to him was un
known, and which in all likelihood was strewn with
mines or torpedoes. Straight through every danger,
whether known or unknown, that menaced him he
held his way, and at daybreak the startled Spaniards
at their posts along the harbor saw the fleet with
Old Glory streaming to the winds advancing to the
attack.
Then from the forts and batteries along the shore
and from the Spanish warships in the harbor the guns
of Spain sent shot and shell to sink or drive back the
fleet that had so daringly assailed them in their
stronghold. Had the American fleet been com
manded by an officer of daring only, that terrific fire
might have destroyed it, but Dewey proved himself
a master of naval tactics as well as a man of valor.
The Spanish concede that his maneuvering during
the engagement was a notable feature of the fierce
fight. Once the American fleet seemingly retired
from the fray, but soon returned.; and then the end
came swiftly, bringing defeat to the Spaniards on
land and sea, and victory for the Union and its gallant
seamen.
The Spanish authorities, while conceding the heavy
losses suffered by their arms, claim that their forces
fought with courage and patriotism. The claim is
not without justice. Certainly the captain of the Span
ish flagship who died at his post fell as a brave man
would wish to fall when overtaken by defeat. The
very courage of the Spaniards, however, adds to the
glory achieved by the Americans in meeting such
foes under the very walls of their forts and batteries,
and in a harbor familiar to them, but strange to the
Americans.
The victory is in every way a notable one, 2nd
moreover is as useful as it is glorious. It renders us
virtual masters of Manila and thus gives us a coaling
station and port of refuge in that part of the globe.
Hereafter we shall not have to take such hazardous
chances as in this combat. Commodore Dewey and
his men have attested the virtue of the fighting
strength of the republic, demonstrated anew the in
vincible daring of our seamen and added another
splendid chapter to the history of our triumphs.
THE SCHOOL BOARD fIT BAY.
ACTION taken by the Board of Education at a
special meeting on Saturday shows that the
members of the board have been aroused at
last to the necessity of doing something to assist in
the task of exposing the manipulators of the lumber
jobs that have been brought to light, and thereby aid
in relieving the innocent members of the board from
suspicion by making the guilty parties known and
bringing them to punishment.
To carry out the investigation the president of the
board has been authorized to employ experts in the
lumber and building trades. These experts are not to
exceed three in number, and none of them are to be
connected with the Retail Lumbermen's Exchange.
This has a fair sound. It promises a committee that
will work intelligently in the examination of the
charges and will be impartial in judging between the
city and the contractors who are alleged to have been
implicated in the jobs.
A proposition, however, is not necessarily fair
simply because it sounds fair. It is possible, under
the terms stated, for the president of the board to ap
point a set of experts who will be merely a white
washing committee. That fact is well understood by
the people, and the personnel of the committee will be
watchfully scrutinized. The president of the board
must be careful in selecting the committee. He can
not afford to make a mistake.
The scandals to be investigated are among the
gravest that have ever affected any part of our muni-
cipal administration. The evidence which has been
made public in regard to them shows that the school
funds have been seemingly plundered of large
amounts under circumstances which compel the con
clusion that at least some of the members of the
Board of Education must have been aware of the
plundering. The charges have been specific and the
correctness of the statements supporting them can
hardly be doubted. If, therefore, the charges are to
be disproved and the statements refuted the investi
gation for that purpose must be made by men of the
highest character and must be conducted openly, so
that every particle of the testimony and evidence may
be made known to the public.
It is to be regretted that under the resolution by
which the committee is to be appointed the work of
the experts will be confined to the task of examining
"into the quality and the quantity of lumber furnished
to the School Department" by a specified firm of
lumber dealers. The committee should have been
given power to make a full and comprehensive inves
tigation, so that it would be authorized to report on
all the facts of the case. In that way the people would
have been given more confidence in the work of the
committee.
Fortunately the determination of the case will not
be dependent upon the report of the School Board
experts, whatever report they may make. The Grand
Jury has brought to light a mass of evidence which
clearly shows frauds, and the courts will be called
upon to discover the guilty parties and provide for
their punishment.
AGITATOR OR SOLDIER. '
REPORTS of last week to the effect that Bryan
is seriously contemplating enlistment in the vol
unteer army are not inherently improbable.
The work of an agitator is a hard one. and the agita
tion in which Bryan is engaged promises nothing in
the way of repayment. Enlistment would be for him
a rest from wearisome talking and a step toward re
form, both of which would be beneficial to him.
An illustration of the hard work required of Bryan
in trying to keep at least a show of life in the silver
issue is afforded by an account given in the Phila
delphia Ledger of a single day of his recent tour of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, MAY 2, 1898.
I Pennsylvania. The Ledger says: "On Wednesday
he reached Hazelton, fought his way through a mob
to a carriage, met a lot of people, dined, delivered an
address, journeyed on to Pottsville, held two recep
tions there, made a speech three hours long, and
wouiid up the day at a banquet."
Bryan is a strong man in the jaws of him, and
his lungs are leather, but even he must feel the need
of a rest from such incessant talking, traveling and
banqueting as that. Six months in Cuba at hard
fighting ought to seem a relief to him. If it offered
no other inducement than that of a rest from mobs
and a cessation from the iteration of the old worn
arguments of the silver campaign, enlistment must
still have an attraction hard to resist.
The hopelessness of the task in which he is en
gaged is another thing that must incline Mr. Bryan
to seek a rest. The course of events ever since the
campaign of '96 has shown the fallacy of the free sil
ver arguments. There has been a steady rise in prices
of nearly all kinds of American products and a con
tinuous importation of gold. It is noted that over
70 per cent of the cash holdings of the New York
banks is gold coin. Eastern banks are shipping gold
coin instead of bills to their correspondents in the in
terior; 20 per cent of custom payments are made
in gold, and the treasury gold reserve exceeds $180,
000,000. According to the estimates of the Treasury
Department there is more than $800,000,000 of gold in
the country.
In the face of such golden conditions as these it is
certainly folly to go on howling calamity. Moreover,
Mr. Bryan can hardly have overlooked the growing
popularity of Fitzhugh Lee in the Democratic ranks.
He has sense enough to perceive that the country
honors at this time the man of action and not the
mere talker. This fact also serves as an impelling
force toward enlistment, and it is therefore not to be
wondered that Bryan is in a mood to talk of it and
possibly even to think about it.
ENGINEERS IN THE NAVY.
SEABOARD, a journal which is recognized as
the organ of the shipping interests of the East
ern States, and may therefore be considered a
representative of American seamen, directs attention
to an incident in connection with the officering of the
vessels newly purchased from the mercantile marine
for the navy, which in a striking way illustrates the
need of a revision of the present method of rating
engineers in the naval service.
In fitting the ships for immediate service it was de
sired, says Seaboard, "to retain as far as practicable
the officers and crews of these vessels, but it was soon
found that while the engineers are machinists, they
are also engineers,and would not enlist as 'machinists'
to do engineer's work and surrender all claim to
being an officer."
While patriotism may have demanded that the en
gineers should enlist for the war even if they were to
be rated simply as machinists and not as officers,
there are many good reasons why they should have
acted exactly as they did. Their course has served to
force the issue of a just recognition of the important
part the engineer plays in the management of modern
ships, and therefore will be helpful in bringing about
a concession of the claims of engineers to be rated as
officers.
This view is taken by Seaboard, which says: "It
is possible the navy may get engineers to enlist as
machinists, but we do not believe the better class of
them would do it." As a means of solving the diffi
culty until Congress can pass a navy personnel bill
which will give engineers in the navy the rank they
merit it suggests that volunteer engineers be given
acting appointments, as was done during the Civil
War. That much of justice can be easily done, and
should not be delayed.
There is no question but what the navy will get all
the engineers it needs, for the men of that profession
are as patriotic as those of any other, but in these days
when marine engineering requires men of scientific
training and accomplishments to master its duties, it
is absurd to go on treating the jnembers oi the pro
fession as if they were unfitted to hold official rank.
A STRONG LAW NEEDED.
S~~* OMMENTING upon the frequently made
I statement that the failure to enlorce pure food
laws is due to the lack of popular sentiment be
hind them, City and State of Philadelphia very justly
says: "To put down profitable wrong â wrong which
finds a golden reward in preying upon the public â
needs a masterful law, a law which says 'Thou shalt
not' with wholesome clearness to the manifest evil,
just as surely as it needs the application of masterful
wit in every other phase of the same, or all the re
sources that can be commanded and marshaled in
order to achieve the end coveted."
This statement is unquestionably true. The task
of enforcing pure food laws ought not to be thrown
upon popular sentiment, nor even upon popular ac
tivities and initiative. Many people are not aware to
what extent their food is adulterated. Others, who
in a general way are aware that large quantities of
"sophisticated" foods are for sale under deceptive
names, have not the time nor the means to assist in
a crusada against the evil. The Government does not
wait for popular sentiment to aid it in suppressing the
manufacture of illicit whisky. Neither should it wait
for such aid in suppressing the manufacture of fraud
ulent foods.
In an address before the Food and Drug Congress
at Washington last winter the Hon. Marriott Brosius
said:
"Perhaps no cause in the whole range of service
lays higher command upon Americans than to pro
vide a remedy, if we can, for this adulteration: the
more I contemplate it the more enormous I find it.
Of the 576 articles of food used on the tables of the
people 253 are adulterated. These may be approxi
mations, but are sufficiently accurate to convey to our
minds the murder that is done in the name of com
merce in food commodities, to say nothing of the
consequences to the morals of our people. What is
said of food is true of drugs. How many of the
potions advised by physicians and administered by
loving hands, in the hope of calling back to life and
health, are vitiated by deleterious substances or ren
dered useless by adulterations?"
The evil is indeed one of portentous magnitude and
should be dealt with as vigorously as the illicit dis
tillation of liquors. The Chronicle has suggested the
enaction of a system of taxing such articles as would
bring them under the control of the internal revenue,
and there is much to commend the plan. Either that
or some other should be adopted which will bring the
matter under national supervision. Popular senti
ment on the subject is all right, but the nation must
make the law and enforce it in a masterful way.
The resolve of the Board of Education to appoint
a committee to go over the lumber deals recently
exposed by the Grand Jury will not be commended
by the public until it is made certain that the com
mittee is not appointed to whitewash either the lum
ber or the board.

cry delicate fiber, arose from the boxes
and seats and fled wildly hither and
thither, looking in vain for some place
to faint; gilded youths forgot the set of
their ties as they struggled for the exit,
and the orchestra, joining in the general
panic, forsook their beloved instruments
and scrambled over the stage, one after
another, as though they were storming
a body of Spaniards who had taken
refuge in a brewery. In the galleries the
scene was Intensified. Coats and wraps
were torn and trampled under foot in the
mad struggle of fear, while the occa
sional flashes of cruel red light that shot
in through the side entrance and, pene
trating the steamy gloom, lit up for the
moment with their vivid brilliancy the
struggling crowd, showed by the lines of
the strained faces on which they mo

panic that for the instant had seized
upon all.
Behind the wings everything waa In a
state of chaos. Melba had fainted, and
her manager had carried her off. Scene
shifters were running frantically about
trying to pacify the performers, who were
struggling with the fly-men, prompters,
property men, mechanics and supernum

the stage entrance into the comparative
safety of the hotel next door.
OutÃide the main entrance a huge mass
of struggling humanity and plunging
horses packed the street for a solid block.
Men fought with men in their mad ef
forts to get first into the open, while
others who had some loved ones exposed
to the terrible danger within, struggled
wilh equal desperation to get inside and
rescue them from the dreadful fate that
awaited them.
Two gentlemen, strangers in the city,
happened to be crossing Bush street on

height. The elder of the two addressing
a policeman who waa trying to calm a
crying child, said: '"Officer, what is all
this panic about? Surely it cannot be
that a fire in a stable next door has so
worked on the fears of a San Francisco

Divers in the British navy have to dem
onstrate their skill before being passed
as proficient, the examination being- very
practical, and consists In being able to
work in twelve fathoms of water for one
hour, fifteen fathoms for half an hour
and twenty fathoms for fifteen minutes.
One part of the Russian naval pro
gramme is to build three battleships of
12,675 tons each of the Peresvet type and
armed with four 10-inch guns each. They
are to be built at St. Petersburg and will
be assigned to the Baltic fleet. Besides
these armored ships a fast cruiser of 8000
tons, of the type of the British torpedo
ship Vulcan, Is to be built at Nicolaieff.
A second-class cruiser of 5650 tons, built
at Danzig for the German navy, has just
been launched. Another of the same type
is still on the stocks at Danzig- and two
j more are building at Stettin and Bremen.
They are 350 feet in lengrh and are to
steam 20 knots. The armament Jrill be
very powerful, consisting of two 8.2-inch,
I eight 6-inch, all quick-fires, also ten 3.4
| inch, ten 1.4-inch, four machine guns and
I three submerged torpedo tubes.
The eight torpedo-boat destroyers bulld
; ing in England for Japan are of 300 tons
| displacement, and are to be completed
: gradually after June next. Their names
I in Japanese and translated into English
are:
No. Iâlkazuch1 â Ikazuchl â Thunder.
No. 2 â lnazuma â Lightning.
No. 3 â Shinonome â Dawn of the day.
No. 4 â Murakuino â Bank of clouds.
No. sâAkebon5 â Akebono â Morning twilight.
No. 6 â FazanamI â Rippling waves.
No. 7 â Yupririâ^-Xening mist.
No. S â Shlranukt â Phosphorescence.
Four torpedo-boats of 150 tons each are
i building on the continent, three in France
j and one in Germany. The first three have
i been named:
No. IâHayabus1 â Hayabusa â Vulture.
No. 2â Knsarag-iâ Magpie.
No. 3â Managuraâ Crane.
The boat bulding in Germany Is named
j Shirataka, or White Hawk. While the
i names are neither nautical nor naval, but
I rather poetical and commonplace, the
boats will make up for this trivial neglect
â  in that the torpedo-boat destroyers will
have a speed of 31 knots and the torpedo
: boats 28 knots.
The London Engineer never misses any
1 chance for showing its ill feeling toward
| the United States, and the war between
Spain and this country afforded the paper
referred to a chance to elaborately dem
onstrate to its own evident satlsfaci.on
that the United States is inferior to Spain
as a naval power. It groups nine of our
vessels of war in three classes, namely
the Indiana, Massachusetts and lowa in
the first class; Brooklyn and New York
in the second, and the "luinneapolis, San
Francisco, Columbia and New Orleans in
the third class. In juxtaposition it places
five Spanish armored ships, two cruisers,
five torpedo-boat destroyers and three
torpedo-boats, making a total of sixteen
effective war vessels of Spain. Upon the
basis of these grossly incomplete data, so
far as they relate to the United BtatM
navy, the Engineer works out a compara
tive efficiency, elucidated by diagrams, of
which flic following are the rfHiilts:

The British second-class cruiser Hermes
of iiGSO tons was launched at the Fairficld
yard, Glasgow, April 7. Two more of that
type are building. They are improve
ments In the .-agiclenne class, and with
the larger displacement of 2800 tons will
carry their batteries higher out of water
and have greater speed. The Hermes is
sheathed with wood and coppered and is
050 feet long, 54 feet beam and 21 feet
draught. The speed is to be 20 knots.
The main armament of eleven 4.7-inch
quick-firers is disposed so that three will
fire directly ahead and three directly
astern. The quantity of ammunition car
ried may be inferred from the fact that
the forward magazine is 58 feet in length
and the after magazine 42 feet, making a
total of 100 feet stowed with ready-made
projectiles and other ammunition. The
axis of the forecastle gun will be 28% feet
above water and that on the poop 19V4
feet. All the guns are protected by 4^
inch shields.
SONGS OF THE HOUR,
"I SALUTE THEE."
O, my country, I salute thee.
As thy banners are unfurled,
As thou risest in thy patient might supreme;
And a holy peace comes o'er me,
As thy statemen face the world,
With thy message beacon-signaled
In thy sword's far-flashing gleam.
O, my country, dare we chide thee.
Who had hoped thy queenly brow
Would receive Time's rarest crown, the wreath
of peace?
It were thine â but, lo! Thou turnest
From such coronation now,
To unclasp a tyrant's death-clutch!
Ah! for that, whose praise would cease?
I have watched thy bosom heaving.
Large with pity, wrenched by pain;
I have prayed â and seen sweet patience light
thine eyes.
But the tyrant mocks by falseness â
Flays thy neighbor â blasts thy Maine!
Maine!
Dare I chide thy clean sword's gleaming?
Shall I carp when thou dost rise?
No. my country! Thou art glraed
By the guardian arm of God!
"He hath laid help on the might"â thus Ha
saves.
O, thy beauteous strength ne'er charmed me
More than now, when Cuba's sod
Feels thy shadow make a shelter
For her peopleâ and her graves'.
â William Knight in Boston Journal.
CHICfiMAUGAâ IB9B.
They are camped on Chlckamauga!
Once again the white tents gleam
On that Held where vanished heroes
Sleep the sleep that knows no dream.
There are shadows all about them
Of the ghostly troops to-day,
But they light the common campfireâ
Those who wore the blue and gray.
Where the pines of Georgia tower,
Where the mountains kiss the sky,
On their arms the Nation's warriors
Walt to hear the battle-cry-
Wait together, friends and brothers.
And the heroes 'neath their feet
Sleep the long and dreamless slumber
Where the flowers are blooming sweet-
Sentries, pause, yon shadow challenge!
Rock-ribbed Thomas goes that way-
He who fought the foe unyielding
In that awful battle fray.
Yonder pass the shades of heroes.
And they follow where Bragg leads.
Through the meadows and the river.
But no ghost the sentry heeds.
Field of fame, a patriot army
Treads thy sacred sod to-day!
And they'll face a common foeman.
Those who wore the blue and gray.
And they'll fight for common country.
And "they'll charge to victory
'Neath the folds of one brave banner-
Starry banner of the free!
They are camped on Chickamauga,
Where the green tents of the dead
Turn the soil into a glory
Where a nation's heart once bled;
But they're clasping hands together
On this storied field of strife-
Brothers brave who meet to battle
In the freedom- war of life!

OFF TO SEA.
Our ships have put to sea.
And to windward and to lee
The old flag is flying, flying, flying;
And it ripples its red bars
And the glory of its stars
Where the spirits of the stormy deep are
crying:
"On to the fight!
Let the stars of Freedom light
The land beneath the tyrant's banner gory;
Till every tyrant flag
Is a torn and trampled rag.
And alone in the sunlight waves 'Old Glory!' "
Our ships have put to sea.
And the light of Liberty
Dawns o'er the people sad and dying;
The chains of thralldom break.
And the thrones of tyrants shake
iVhile the spirits of the stormy deep- are cry-
Ing:
"Fare ye to the fight!
Let the stars of Freedom light
The land beneath the tyrant's banner jory.
Till every tyrant flag
Is a torn and trampled rag.
And alone In the sunlight waves 'Old Glory!' "
âFrank L. Stanton In Atlanta Constitution.
TWO VIEWS OF WflÃ.
Stirring drums in a sunny street,
A bonnie flag in the azure sky,
A luring melody, tramping feet.
And hope in many an eye.
Death In a still and shadowed room,
A pallid, boyish face at rest,
A sunbeam quivering in the gioom.
And woe in a woman's breast.
â Henry Robinson Palmer.
TOO MANY WOULD-BE COLONELS.
Nothing can be more out of place and
positively harmful to the national interest
than the general disposition to suspend
work and go about snouting and offering
to raise regiments. This Is the very worst
tiling a man can do for his country at
the present juncture. There may be a
call for gratuitous exhibitions of patriotic
feeling of this kind later on if the worst
sort of fortune follows our cause persist
ently enough, but for the present the
government will have more men offering
their services from the National Guard
of the several States than it will know
well what to do with. It is, we must
repeat again, not numbers as much as
training, efficiency and armament that
count in war to-day, and industrial power
is the basis and support of all. The great
battleship Massachusetts carries a crew
of 500 officers and men. but its power is
immeasurably above that of the men
mighty Royal George:
When Kempenfeldt went down
With twice four hundred men.
It were better, then, for the shoemaker or
even the politician to stick to his last,
than to go about offering or attempting
to raise raw regiments for whose effective
use there is no prospect, immediate or re
mote. "When the Government needs such
service it will call for it.â Springfield
(Mass.) Republican.
INDUSTRIAL, CONQUESTS.
In the midst of war preparations it is a
gratifying fact that tne demand for our
manufactured articles is growing in many
directions. Orders have increased this
year for American railroad iron, engines,
bridges, plows, cultivators, reapers,
thrashers, hullers, cotton-working ma
chines, stamp mills and steam engines."
American electrical machinery has control
of the whole field. Not long ago three
water wheels of 450 horse power each were
sent to an electric motor company In
Japan. American machinery is replacing
that of foreign made in Mexico. Russia
has followed Japan in ordering new bat
tleships In our yards.â St. Louis Globe-

The recruiting officer at the Presidio is

1 I that post. The cavalry troops will be
increased from sixty-five to 100 men and
the heavy batteries of artillery to 200 men.
The Increase of the number of enlisted
men In the troops of cavalry will cause
â¢a corresponding increase in the number
of cavalry horses, which will be purchased
probably under emergency by the quar
termaster's department. Heretofore it
has been necessary to advertise for thirty
days and award the contract to the lowest
bidder; but under the present emergency
. army officers are of the opinion that this
formality will be dispensed with and that
the. troopers will be immediately provided
with mounts.
The four batteries of heavy artillery are
', in permanent camp at Fort Point, Colonel
Marcus P. Miller commanding. The col
onel will also make -his headquarters at
the fortifications.
Small detachments of artillery were left
behind at Angel Island and Fort Mason,
but it is generally believed by those in
positions to know that as soon as the
â  volunteer artillery is raised one battery
will take station at Fort Mason and one
" t . at Angel Island, relieving the few reg

. the barracks and quarters.

The following significant order has been
received at the navy-yard from the chief
of the Bureau of Navigation, and as a
result the naval recruiting officers are
having their hands full. The clause re

may have the effect of keeping with the
new boats many of the men who have
been with them so long.
The enlistment of engineers as chief
machinists" is causing considerable dis
satisfaction, however, for the Government
licenses all marine engineers and they
hold a certain rank by virtue of their. pa
pers. They claim to class them as any
thing-lower than engineers or assistant
â¢ engineers is to degrade them, and so there
may not be so many on the machinists'

THE RED LIGHTS OF VICTORY
Ked lights of victory, glowing and glorious, gleamed from the
dome of the lofty Claus Spreckcls building last night. Their far
flashing splendors streaming through the darkness carried to the
people of every part of San Francisco, of all neighboring towns
and throughout the surrounding country, the glad tidings of the
great victory achieved by the American fleet under Commodore
Dewey at Manila.
The brilliant blaze caught every eye. The thousands ol
people who were on the streets of San Francisco and of the
towns around the bay were attracted by the scintillant corrusca
tions of the radiant beams and at once the meaning was under
stood. Patriots knew without further information that The Cali
had received n|\vs of some magnificent accomplishment of Ameri
can arms â some splendid victory for the-flag â and was displaying
the red lights in order that all might know the glorious tidings
without delay.
The outburst of the lights was at once followed by gatherings
of the people into groups at all salient points of the city and
vicinity. In each of these groups patriotic ardor broke forth.
All knew that there was no fake back of this display. Ail were
certain that the news was reliable and the victory sure. At once
the cheering began. It rolled in long, loud, triumphant shouts
from the upper part of the city to the water front. The streets
resounded with acclamations. It was like a gala night. Far
over all the wide region around the red lights from the towering
dome flashed and gleamed, and everywhere the sight was greeted
with jubilant voices.
This is the first time the red lights of victory have gleamed
from the dome of the Claus Spreckels building, but it will not be
the last. Whenever at night there comes news to The Call of a
great deed done in the war, a notable victory won for justice to
America and freedom for Cuba those lights will blaze out the
glad tidings from the dome. Then, as on last night, their radi
ant energies will carry the information to the patriot people for
miles around swifter than electricity could do it. Then, as on
last night, will cheers arise and sounds of rejoicing be heard as
the people join in mutual congratulations over another victory for
the flag.
These, then, will be The Call signals of victory â bulletins
by day and red lights in the dome of the Claus Spreckels build
ing by night. In the present situation new victories may be ex
pected at any time. The news is as likely to come at night as
by day. All citizens should be alert fÂ»nd expectant. There is
no telling when the next glorious news will come. Watch the
soaring dome of the lofty structure in which The Call has its
home. Look out for the red lights^of victory.
CALIFORNIA'S
GOOD RECORD
The Only State That Has
Complied With Re
quirements.
Excitement at Headquarters
Caused by News of Admiral
Dewey's Victory.
Colonel Hopkins to Appoint the Sur
geons Upon the Examining
Board.
The principal State of the Golden
West is greatly admired in Washing
ton for its prompt and vigorous or
ganization of troops for war.
California has done nobly in the
work of offering troops and getting
them in shape without delay or com
plaint. Adjutant-General Corbin
realizes this fact and greatly appre
ciates the patriotism and business
methods of the Californians. He
said in an interview yesterday:
"California is the only State from
which no complaint about quuta or
distribution has come. Otncr States
have been heard from by letter and
wire, and all but California have
made this and that objection. This
State has gone on nobly, organizing
and getting in shape without delay
or interruption. "
The dispatch from Crowninshield, chief
of the Bureau of Navigation, has caused
considerable excitement in the naval mili
tia circles. As published in The Call, the
dispatch was one to General Barrett, stat
ing that the Navy Department hoped to
detail the naval militia for auxiliary
cruisers in the near future. It was the
subject of much discussion and specula
tion aboard the Marion yesterday, and the
general opinion seems to be that the sailor
boys may see some service in the near
future, in fact, that they may have to
rr.r-ve before the National Guard.
"While there has been no official confirm
ation of the fact, for those in authority
have refused to discuss the matter, yet it
is? generally admitted in military circles
tnat the First and Seventh Infantry will
be the two twelve-company regiments
that will be the first to be mustered into
ii.- United States service. The bataiiions
will be made up from the other regiments.
This i 8 as yet only speculation, for the
Governor lias refused to divulge his in
tentions, but those who are on the inside.
Rwho are in a position to look wise,
c dropped suggestive remarks retr:ird
what regiments will be favored. There
. ..o doubt but the regiments will be mus
tered in as a whole.
The absence cf Governor Budd from
headquarters yesterday had the effect of
causing a lull in the local military cir
cles, and making the day a dull one. The
Governor went to Stockton on Saturday
afternoon, and did not return until late
last night. General Barrett was at head-
Kters during the forenoon, but closed
iflke for the evening, and it was not
ed again until late last night, when he
lamed for a short while to sec if there
was anything that needed his attention.
Governor Budd was in communication
with headquarters during the early part
of the day, and was kept informed by
General Barrett as to the situation. The
Governor took this precaution in case
unytJwiie should have arisen calling for
his action. The morning mail brought
tlu- adjutant genera.l and Captain
rington a large amount of mail and dis
patches, but they stated that these con
tained nothing of a nature for publlca-
Lleutenant Colonel T. J. Hay, of the
'yiilrd Brigade, was at headquarters in the
morning, as was Lieutenant Cloman of
the Fifteenth United Rtnu-s infantry, and
Major McCarthy of the First Infantry San
itary Corps. Colonel Burgin. of die Gov
ernor's staff, was also on duty.
Lieutenant Cloman was closeted for a
while with Captain Carrington upon the
receipt by the latter of a dispatch from
"Washington, P. C, but would make no
statement regarding the nature of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL.L, MONDAY, MAY 2, 1898.
message received, and the captain also
refused to divulge the contents of the
dispatch.
For the past few days it has >een whis
pered around headquarters that it is prob
able that the Governor would appoint
Captain Carrington to the office of one of
the colonelcies. It seems to be the gen
eral opinion that the appointment would
meet With the approval of the officers of
the National Guard, for Captain Carring
ton is a capable officer and exceedingly
popular with the local military. It is not
known whether he would accept the
colonelcy if it were tendered to him, for
he is most anxious to rejoin his regiment.
If he receives the appointment it will
come in the nature of a surprise to him,
for he has not the slightest idea that his
appointment' has been the subject of con
sideration. . â¢â¢ â  - â¢ - /
Ccxmel Smith of the First Infantry was
at headquarters last night. He reported
that the muster rolls of his regiment con
tained 1227 men, exclusive of field, staff
and band and sanitary corps. Colonel
Smith sajd that in event of the First being
mustered into service in the near future
he hoped the War Department would see
lit to order his command away from the
city. He thought It would be very de
moralizing to the men to remain here as
one of the chief incentives that caused !
the majority of the men to enlist was the !
assurance that they would see service
The colonel said that if the First was not
ordered away and went into camp here
he would have to be a tyrant to preserve
discipline. He is of the opinion that the
home influences, which could not be pre
vented, would have any but the desired
effect upon the soldiers.
When the news of the naval engagement
was received at headquarters it caused
the greatest excitement. It was eagerly
discussed by the Governor, General Bar
rett and Captain Carrington.
Surgeon-General Hopkins was closeted
with Governor Budd late last night, and it
is believed that the conference was rela
tive to the appointment of those surgeons
who will constitute the examining board
It is announced that the Governor has !
relegated the power of making these ap
pointments to Colonel Hopkins.
The Governor and the officers of the
National Guard feel highly complimented
over the favorable comments made upon
the loyalty of the Guard and its prompt
ness in responding to the President's call
California ha.s been enabled to make its <
quick response because it was prepared, I
for the Guard, when it was reorganized'
was done so upon the present basis Just !
adopted by the Government for the reg
ular army.
Governor Budd is of the opinion that I
the engagement at Manila will have the
effect of turning the attention of the i
Government to this coast and that speedy
recognition of ,Â«ur important position rela
tive to the Philippines will soon follow.
"MAINE" PICTURES.
Biograph Projections at
the Olympia Enthusi
astically Received.
The patriotism of shouts and applause
took hold of the audience at the Olympia
last night when the biograph pictures of
the wrecked Maine and Cuban scenes
were projected on the canvas. Just as
soon as the disastrous news of the de
struction of the Maine reached New York
a corps of kinetoscope operators was dis
patched to the scene and pictures were
taken. These were presented last night
at the Olympia for the lirst time in San
Francisoc.
The lirst picture which aroused the emo
tions of the audience was the distribution
of food to the reconcentrados at Los
Fosos relief station, Havana. The wretch
ed condition of the. herded Cubans is
clearly produced in projection. Gaunt and
starved, the eager and shadowy Cubans
are seen in their rush for tho necessary
sustenance of life..
The divers working on the wrecked ship
is another subject which called forth the
applause of the audience. This was fol
lowed by a panoramic view of the Maine
after the explosion. The American sub
jects close with the departure of General
Fitzhugh Lee from the Hotel ingietirra.
The Vizcaya In motion was generously
and cordially hissed, which expression of
detestation was, however, soon changed
into cheers and stormy hurrahs when the
start, and stripes were thrown out In bold
relief.
Workingmen Elect Officers.
The United "Workingmen and Labor

Cycle Hall, corner Page and Stanyan

NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
The Strength of the Or
ganized Force Since
Recruiting.
A Good Selection for Quarter
master of the Fifth
Regiment.
Ambitious Signalmen Climb the Rug
ged. Sides of Mount Tamalpais
for Practice Work.
On the Ist of March last the numerical
strength of the National Guard of the
State of California was a little In excess
of 4700 men, as appeared by the rolls in
the office of the adjutant-general. Since
the orders were given, on prospects of
war, to captains of companies to recruit
up to the maximum and the placing in
the armories of emergency rolls the guard
has, according to all reports, been re
cruited up to its full strength, and there
are in some companies more enrollments
on the emergency roll than will make
up the maximum of 103, rank and file.
This would bring up t,he strength at this
time, including the commander-in-chief
and staff, division commander and staff,
three brigade commanders and staffs,
three signal Â«_orps, four troops of cavalry,
naval militia, five regiments of infantry,
sanitary corps and cadet corps, up to 6SOO
men.
The majority of the men who have been
sworn into the service of the State and
the majority of those who have signed the
emergency rolls are men between the age
of 18 and 45, while in the ranks already
sworn in as National Guardsmen there
are a number of men who have grown
gray in the service of the State and have
passed the 45 year notch. There is some
degree of curiosity among the guardsmen
as to the number of men who will pass
muster when called upon to appear before
the mustering officer* designated by the
War Department. It is the belief, how
ever that the rejection of men will not
be very large, us it is probable that the
examination of the volunteers will not be
as severe as it is for the regular army.
The officers of the several divisions are
apprehensive that they will be ordered
before the examining board, and as an ex
amination before a board of United States
officers means more than such examina
tion before boards in the National Guard
in the past has meant, there have been a
great many close students of late making
themselves familiar with all the details of
the service to which they belong.
THE FIRST REGIMENT INFANTRY.
Second Lieutenant Joseph A. Brown,
Company A, whose term recently expired,
was last week elected to succeed himself
and ordered to appear before the exam
ining board.
During the week there has been a great
deal of activity at the two armories in
which are located companies of this regi
ment but the greatest concern of the
company commanders was to have every
thing in readiness when called out,
whether as National Guardsmen or as vol
unteers What the line officers and men
are much concerned aboutâ as they are
confident that their regiment will be one
of the two ordered out, is whether when
ordered for duty the organization will be
sent out as the First Infantry California
Volunteers or whether it will be distrib
uted to various commands, as was the
California Five Hundred during the Civil
War, which was mustered in as one of
the Massachusetts regiments. The glory
the mea achieved, on the field went to the
credit of the Old Bay State and was lost
to the Golden State. The men of the
First feel that if there is to be any honor
to be gained for California's sons during
the war it should go to the State that
sent them forward. A few days will un
doubtedly relieve them of all anxiety on
The recent tournament at the Pavilion
in aid of the fund to be created for the
purpose of erecting a rifle range at Ingle
side for the First was quite a financial
success It is expected that nearly $1000
will be realized after all bills of expenses
shall have been paid.
THE FIFTH REGIMENT.
Since the issuance of regimental order
No. 3, in the latter part of March, there
have been discharged from the Fifth
Regiment Infantry one enlisted man from
Company A, four from Company B, five
from Company E, two from Company F
and three from Company 11, fifteen in all.
Of this number nine were discharged on
account of removal, three at expiration
of term of service and three for the good
of the service.
Corporal Gilbert A. Wright has been
appointed sergeant of Company H with
rank from April IN.
Private M. Zarcone has been returned
I to Company B without loss of time.
A furlough of sixty days has been
granted to Corporal George M. A\ illiams
of Company E and to Private G. C. Han
son of Company F.
All commanding officers have been
ordered to communicate at once to regi
mental headquarters the number of ser
viceable rifles in their respective com
panies. Colonel i<a:"banks says: "By
! serviceable rifles is meant not only the
I model of '84, but also all guns of previous
models that aio serviceable.' 1
Amos W. Kimball, for many yeara a
clerk in the quartermasters department
of the Department of California, baa been
appointed quartermaster of the Fifth
Regiment, vice John 11. Hendy, promoted
major on the staff of Brigadier General
Warfield. This is unquestionably one of
the best appointments for that position
that has been made in the National Guard
of this State for many pears. Mr. Kim
ball who will rank as iirst lieutenant,
has from his connection with the quar
termaster's department knowledge of the
requirements of the position and the
duties he will have to perform mat but
few men possess. Should the Fifth be
called out for duty his s. rvlcea to the
regiment will be of the highest value.
THE SIGNAL. CORPS.
The members as well as the officers of
the Signal Corps of the Second Brigade
have been on the anxious seat ever since
the war began, in this, that in the call
for men to go to the front no mention has
been made of the signal men. They feel
that they are at this time :is Important
a branch oi the service us the signal men
were during the War of the Rebellion,
and possibly a little more so, in view of
the improvement, in the service, and for
that reason want to be assigned to duty
and have asked for assignment.
It has been admitted that this corps is
I as nearly perfect in the use of the flags,
I heliotrope or torch as any body of men
! can bo, still the members are not satts
i Bed to rest content with this, for at
every opportunity they engage in the
work of signaling. Yesterday three
Bquads of the company were at work on
Mount Tamalpais with a heliotrope, and
I a like number of sqp&dS were on this side
of the water responding to the signals
sont. The squads that worked in Marin
I County left on Saturday afternoon in
service uniforms, carried blankets and
had a day's provisions in their haver
sacks. They commenced the ascent of
the mountain sit 7 o'clock at night, and
when about halfway up found shelter un
der the trees and turned In for the night.
At early dawn, after a hasty breakfast.*
thoy resumed the ascent, and as soon as
It qleari'd enough to make out locations
on this side they sent signals to discover
their t'Hlow signal men, who were on San
Francisco hill stations, but on which
those on the mountain did not know, and
they were forced to discover them. The
practice was a successful one, nnd those
who went on the other side of the bay
had a practical experli-no.' <,;' what rough
ing it is. They returned late in the after
noon.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
The men of the two divisions of the
Naval Militia stationed at this port are
not at this time lacking in practice to
make them perfect, for each day there
aro ten men on duty on board of the
Marion in charge of two officers, and in
addition to the duty they perform there
they are compelled to drill on ship and
ashore. The new men who have recently
been recruited have done well, and tht-r'e
is no doubt that the officers and men
will be ready to perform any sea or shore
duty that they may be assigned to during
the war. The officers are still perfecting
themselves in navigation, and it is aston
ishing to note what progress they have
made in that line.
The men hope that the Government will
place some modern armament on the
Marion, place her in commission and use
her as a patrol vessel up and down the
coast; still, if that is not done, they are
content to do any duty that will give
them an opportunity to display their
willing-ness and ability, and they feel
sure that they will make a record for
themselves that the citizens of this State
will feel proud of.
THE DEVOTION
OF A WOMAN
A Wife Worrying Over Her
Husband's Troubles Loses
Her Reason.
Mrs. W. H. Tubbs Could Not Stand
the Treatment of the Congre
gational Ministers.
Mrs. W. H. Tubbs, the wife of Rev. W.
H. Tubbs of Bethlehem Congregational
Church, has lost her reason. The fact in
itself is sad, but when it is known that
worrying over the troubles of her nus
band was the cause of it it takes on ft
much more pathetic aspect.
Mr. and Mrs. Tubbs were married near
ly forty years ago, and together they had
struggled side by side, sharing one an
other's troubles. Fortune did not alwayo
smile upon them, but that mattered lit
tle UL long ao they had their children
around them, food for them and a roof
under which to sleep.
Some time ago Dr. Tubbs took charge
oi the Bethlehem Congregational Church
on Vermont and Twenty-fourth streets.
The place needed repairing, so he went
to work to have it done. He, however,
had not ask#d the permission of the
Church Extension Society, and when he
went to the church one day he saw a
notice posted there to the effect that all
work done there would be done By Wil
liam 11. Tubbs' orders and he alone would
be responsible for all bills. The article
was signed by Rev. W. C Pond of Beth
any Congregational Church.
Dr. Tubbs immediately inquired into the
matter and found the trouble 10 be that
he had not asked permission of the Ex
tension Society. The clergyman explained
that he did not know it was necessary,
but since it was the rule he was willing
to comply. He obtained the required per
mission and the society promised to help
him pay off the debt. Dr. Tubbs shortly
after this became ill and was unable to
meet the interest on the debt, the Ex
tension Society having to pay it. Dr.
Tubbs, on recovering', obtained the money
necessary for the quarter and promised
the society that the back interest should
be refunded to them.
Shortly after this Dr. Tubbs asked for
the money for his church that had been
promised. His petition was answeted by
a polite note saying that whenever he re
signed as pastor of the church the money
should be gi% r en to it, but as long as he
remained the congregation should be ad
vanced no money.
This brought back a letter from the
clergyman saying that if his people
wished him to resign he would do so im
mediately, but if not he would remain
as long as they wished him. Dr. Tubbs
remained, every one of his Mock informing
him individually that if he left they
would leave also. Thus the matter rested,
Dr. Tubbs and the members of the con
gregation going to work to release them
selves from the deu.
Mrs. Tubbs, who has been a suf
ferer from rheumatism for some time,
worried and fretted over her husband's
troubles and soon this terrible affliction
came upon her.

GOLDFIELDS
John D. Tallant, the
Banker, Sailed on
the Alaska.
Will Purchase Claims on
the Kubuck for a
Syndicate.
Char.es W. Baumann, a Cigar-
Maker, Sailed on the
Same Vessel.
HAS DESERTED HIS WIFE.
SeTeral Wealthy Men Sending Pros
pectors to the New Oold
fields.
The bark Alaska, which sailed for the
Kotzebue Sound gold-fields last week,
took away at least one important per
sonage and another who would be only
too gladly welcomed back by his wife
and child.
John D. Tallant. president of the Tal
lant Banking Company, accompanied by
his private secretary, boarded the vessel
at' the last moment. He Is going with
the intention of investing large sums in
the mfhes on the Kubuck River.
Part of the Northern Light's cargo will
be a large safe and a full supply of pro
visions- for Banker John D. Tallant and
his secretary. Mr. Tallant has been con
templating making the trip from the time
the Alaska was put on the berth for the
new gcrld fields. He was working on
private information, and Interested a
number of Denver and New York bankers
in the -scheme. In consequence he goes
north fully prepared to purchase any of
the rich mines that- may be discovered
on the. Kubuck this season.
Mr. Tailanfs departure was kept very
secret, and Captain Cogan and Agent
Wood" only knew the day before the
Alaska Bailed that he was going. Then,
in order to accommodate the banker and
his" secretary, tne first and second mates
had to be turned out of their rooms in
â order, that they might be lined up forj
the pasengera Mr. Tallant is not ex
pected back in San Francisco before next
â Other wealthy men who are sending
north to the Koczebue fields are Lippman
Sachs of Sachs Bros. <fc Co. and A. ii.
Bpfedcels. A : smart little 30-ton schooner
named-: the Mary Sachs has just been
turned out of Turner's yard, and she will
eaii m a few days for the Kubuck River
with a party of prospectors.
Mr Spreckels' Interests will be looked
after by Cy Mulk.-y and six miners, who
are going north on the barkentine Cath- |
erine Sudden. The latter vessel was open .
for -inspection yesterday, and she was
crowded all day. A better fitted out boat
will not leave San Francisco. All her
cabins are large and well furnished, while
the dini-ng-room- can accommodate 10s
passengers -at one sitting. Unlike the
Other vessels, the tables do not run fore
and aJt, but athwart ship, thus giving
every body elbow-room. There are nine
tables in all, and twelve men can be com- j
fortably accommodated at each table. ;
There is room on the barkentine for 200 j
passengers, but -the chances are that not
more than 150 will go away on her.
Arming others who will go on the Sud
â¢. den arj?. Frank Stone, the well-known at
torney; S. E. Dutton, the book seller and
publisher; J.-S. Wills and a party from
Pasadena, J. M. Schultz and a party from j
Tulare and Dr. J. W. Sorrick and a party !
from Ohio.
The Muiky party is taking up its own i
river steamer, while the barkentine will
take along two steamers and four boats i
or â¢ barges, now almost complete at j
Tiburon.
Charljss.W. Baufnann, cigar-maker, also ;
went north on the Alaska, and now his
wife la trying by every means in her i
power to reach him. Saturday last she ;
called upon Captain Dunleavy at the ,
Harbor police-station, and that gentle
man. sent an officer with her to H. R. j
Wood, agent for the Alaska and North- ;
crn Light. All Mr. Wood couid tell her j
was that Baumann had purchased his j
ticket and sailed on the Alaska last
Friday.
While Mrs. Baumann was telling her
troubles Captain Whiteside of the North
ern Light came in and to him she re
laxed rrer story. She and her husband
have been married about five years and
they Have one child, so she says. Busi
ness has not been good for some months >
back, so Mrs. Baumann sent the child to â 
some "friends In the country and then j
â¢wejlt out to service. While she was at j
work, she says, her husband sold out his j
interest in the cigar business and every
thing else that they had and made all
his preparations to go to Kotzebue. Sound
without her. According to her story
Baumann must have spent about $900 In
getting his outfit together and then sailed
away, leaving her destitute. She appealed
to Captain Whiteside to take her along
on the Northern Light, so that she could i
Join her husband on Kotzebue Sound, but
this the captain is not willing to do, as !
he saj's if Mrs. Baumann's story is true j
and her husband deserted her here, he |
will have nothing to do with her when
s,he gets to Kotzebue Sound.
What Captain Whiteside and Mr. Wood
cannot understand is how Mrs. Baumann
failed to learn that her husband was go-
Ing to- Kotzebue Sound, as his name was j
published in the list of passengers sev- I
eral days before tho Alaska sailed. To '
"this the wife answers that she knew her
husband was going away, but that he
told her his stay would not be more than j
a month or so, and she only learned last !
Saturday that he contemplated remain- j
Ing on Kotzebue Sound two years. Cap- '
tain Whiteside has not decided what to !
do in tho matter, but in the meantime his ;
wife and Mrs. Cogan, wife of the Captain i
of the Ala-ska, are looking after the un
fortunate woman.
POLICE WORK IN CHINATOWN. ,
Creditable Report of Arrests Made
by Serg-eant Shea's Squad.
Sergeant Shea, who was retired from
tlw command of the Chinatown squad
Saturday, handed Qhief Lees yesterday a
statement of the work done by himself
and squad from September 17 to Aprjl 29.
It shows that a total of 1735 arrests
werÂ» made during that time. The follow
ing disposition was made of the cases:
1604 convicted and paid tines, 113 convicted
and confined, 3 convicted and appealed,
106 dismissals and 1 pending in Police
Court. Nine were held to answer before
the Superior Court. The amount of finos
and forfeitures collected was 513,300, the
average amount of line being *S i.n. The
staff consisted of Policemen P. J. Tracey,
T. 1\ Burke. T. \Y. Handley. R. N. Silver
and J. Galloway.
The report is a most creditable one and
compares very favorably with any of the
previous squads. It has given great sat
isfaction to the Chief.
Died at the Foot of the Cross.
The body of an unknown man was
found by A. P. Talbot of 170S Baker street
yesterday afternoon on the summit of
Lone Mountain at the foot of the cross.
]{Â» reported his discovery to Police Offlcef
I-iegley. who in turn informed the Cor
oner's" office. When found the deceased
held a pistol in his left hand, which went
to prove that he took his own life.
From papers found on the body, in
which there were several receipts for
bread ani rake-making, it is presumed
that the man was a baker h>- occupation.
ITo was dressed in a light suit or clothes
and wore a fedora hat. He had $fi 75 in
hfs pocket, together with pamphlets and
documents belonging to the Socialist or
ganization whose headquarters is on
Turk street. From the appearance of the
body it is presumed that he has been dead
about three days.
SHOOTING ON
THE RANGES
A Rollicking Celebration
of Swiss Marksmen at
Schuetzen.
Good Shots Vied With Clever
Orators for the Honors
of the Day.
A Quiet Day at Shell Mound Caused
by the Guardsmen Talking
of the War
There was a scene of gayety at Schuet
zen Park yesterday, a rollicking celebra
tion of the centennial admission of Canton
Ticino Into the Swiss Confederation, that
will be remembered by those whose hearts
are in active sympathy with the affairs
of the little Alpine republic for many a
long day. Early in the forenoon the
Sausalito and Tiburon boats were crowded
with excursionists, but many waited until
the later boats to make their pilgrimage
to the Mecca of jollity. The Swiss band
accompanied the first boatload, and made
things lively with a series of national
hymns and popular airs.
On the grounds there were many sources
of amusement furnished, such as a May
pole, a merry-go-round, a shooting-gallery
| and an instantaneous picture concern.
These were all well patronized. Many of
the picnickers brought their luncheon, but
others assembled in the restaurant at
meal time and listened to a few toasts
and some spicy repartee.
A. C. Borel. the Swiss Consul, acted as
honorary president of the day and Dr.
T. A. Rottanzi as active president. About
11 a. m. everybody assembled in the pa
vilion, where Dr. Kottanzi made the
opening address, stating the objects of the
celebration, welcoming everybody and in
troducing A. Borel, the Swiss Consul. The
doctor's oratorical effort was excellent,
considering the fact that he was weighted
down with a carmine badge of office that
would huve made a decent load for San
do\v. The resultant applause was about
evenly divided between Dr. Rottanzi and
the badge. Consul Borel spoke of the
great distance lying between here and
Switzerland and the fact that it made no
difference in the interest taken in the
affairs of the European republic by her
s.'iis and daughters.
C. K. Pioda, the orator of the day, in
Italian, followed in a forceful speech on
the formation of the Swiss Confederacy
and the contributions made to it by Can
ton Ticino.
District Attorney Martinelli of Marin
County, the orator in English, spoke feel
ingly of the relationship existing between
the Swiss republic and this country on
kaccount of so many people of. Swis3 ex
traction making their homes here. His
treatment of the subject was general but
Interesting in every particular. Betorc
District Attorney Martinelli's oration Mrs.
B. Martinelli sang the Swiss National
Anthem, and succeeding it the "iiiar-
Spangled Banner." The latter song
brought forth an ardent outburst of
patriotism.
In the afternoon the time was whiled
away in dancing in the pavilion and tar
get practice. William K. Borlini acted
us cashier of the shooting gallery, A.
Monotti and A. Borlini as managers and
C. P. Guscettl as scorer. The highest
score was made by G. F. Cavalli, editor
of l'Elvetzia, the Swiss newspaper, who
won a prize of $20 with a score of 85
points. G. Orsi came second with 7S
points to his credit.
Among those present who were active
in administering to the comfort and en
joyment of those present Ambrose Gherini
and Misses Marie and Sophie Rottanzi
and Miss E. Gherini deserve special men
tion. The boats returning to San Fran
cisco late in the afternoon and evening
were crowded with the picnickers, all
of whom were well satisfied over the day's
entertainment and patriotic enough to
satisfy the most finical.
The California Schuetzen Club held its
monthly diamond medal shoot at the .
same time, the medal being won oy A. ]
Strecker with a score of 446. Following is
the complete score:

AN IRISH REUNION.
Picnic of the Red Branch Rifles at
Shell Mound Park.
There was a goodly attendance of the
natives and descendants of the native?
of. the little green isle at Shell Mound
Park yesterday, the occasion being the
twenty-ninth annual Irish national excur
sion and reunion, under the auspices of
the Knights of the Red Branch Rifles.
Everybody seemd to have a good time,
especially the young folks, who, in addi
tion to the fun of dancing and frolicking
under the trees, participated in a number
of .the athletic games and races for prizes.
The older folks also took a hand In this
.sport, for there were a large number of
prizes offered for the several events. Be
sides liiese twenty prizes were given out
to (.hove who held lucky tickets -of ad

out for their monthly medal contents and
the scores were fair, for all that there
ty;is a strong wind blowing across the
range during the time of the shooting.
The scores made on the Blunt target, 2i)o

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAT 2, 1898.
TO FIGHT THE
FIERCE FLAMES
A New Water-Tower In
spected and Decided
a Success.
Chief Sullivan Anticipating
Failure Inspected It
Secretly.
Bay and Dupont Streets the Quiet
Scene of the Final Test o.
th-i Machine.
The new water tower that has been In
process of construction at the corpora
tion yard of the Fire Department for the
past three or four months, was tested
early yesterday morning. It proved a
success and reflected credit upon the ln
venter, Henry Croter.
Owing to a doubt as to whether the
new flre-flghter would prove all that its
inventor claimed for it. Chief Engineer
Sullivan decided to test the machine in
an out-of-the-way place, and at an un
seemly hour of the morning, so as not
to bring it and himself into ridicule in
I case of failure. Bay and Dupont streets
was selected as the most appropriate
place for this purpose, and, accordingly,
long before the sun had given any mi
i dication of its awakening, engines, hose
wagons and a small army of firemen de
j scended on the spot confident that they
wouid have the new tower inspected and
tested as to its merits or its failure long
before the average mortal had awakened
from that period of unconsciousness gen
erally known as second sleep.
Promptly at 6 o'clock the three engines
detailed to be in readiness at the ap
: pointed time began puffing and smoking,
showing every Indication that hasty prep
aration was in progress. A half an hour
later the tower, manned by the inventor
and several assistants, was sighted com
ing at break-neck speed around one of
the curves in the seawall sheds.
Ip to this time there was not a living
j soul in the neighborhood except Sam
Rainey, John Maxwell, Chief Engineer
! Sullivan and a few others directly or in
j directly interested in the Fire Depart
ment. People in the vicinity, however, be
ing disturbed by the sound of voices and
the rumbling of heavy trucks over the
pavement, awoke to the realization that
something was "a-doing," and. conse
! quently, lost no time in determining exact
ly what. This imiuisitivenes.s led to the
collection of a motley crowd of human
beings that considerably troubled the
chief and his advisers. "Extra fuel w;us
thrown into the furnaces of the engines i
stationed on the corners and prepara- j
! tlons hastened. The six lines of hose i
| were adjusted in their allotted places on
: the side of the tower, and the word "let
; her po" passed along the line to the men
i in command of the several hydrants.
In a moment the current went coursing
j through the rubber tubes, and in an in- .
1 stant later they were straining to their j
j utmost capacity. The levers were thrown i
open, the water making a mad rush
thr'High the machine into the tower,
where it found outlet forty-five feet
above, descending over 250 feet beyond.
A hundred and fifty pound pressure was
used to show exactly the capacity of the |
machine, but in ordinary, and. In fact,
extraordinary cases, it Is estimated that |
a pressure of ninety pounds will be suf- |
ficient to subdue the most obstinate fire.
i The nozzle used for the occasion was five
; inches in diameter, but any dimension
' may be used as the machine expressly
| provides for this extension.
The brazen crane-like neck in which the
â  nozzle is inserted can be adjusted to suit !
; the convenience of the operator, and can
! ho moved upward and downward with I
the same facility that it can be moved
! in other directions.
The man in charge of exhibiting the
i marvelous ease with which the stream !
! could be diverted and adjusted to any :
height and position, became so enthusi
astic over the gigantic result caused by
a simple pressure on a valve that he mad- â 
; vertently turned the nozzle in a diagonal I
i position with the result of nearly tearing
j away a wooden shed attached to a brick |
warehouse a block away.
Upon proving to the satisfaction of the
Chief Engineer that his new machine was
perfect in detail and execution, the inven- j
tor had it lowered to its position on the i
truck. A battery was next introduced j
for approval, which also was pronounced
a success. It occupies a position on the |
same truck and is operated the same as >
the batteries lately introduced into the i
I'ire Department, being almost identical
In structure with them. It is connected
with the tower and receives its charge
from the same source, both being cap

RECENT PARK IMPROVEMENTS.
Electric Lighting to Be Extended
and Rustic Bridge to Be Finished.
The experimental lighting of electric
lamps in the park has proved a success
and it is probable that the entire system
will soon be done.
"I think we shall be able to have the
lights all finished to Strawberry Hill by
Wednesday," said Superintendent Mc-
Laren yesterday, "and that will give us
a well lighted road over both the north
and the south drives. There will be five
miles of Mire in all
Work is progressing rapidly on the rus

and it will prouably be finished within a

Thousands of visitors have lately ad
mired the blooming rhododendron, which
oame from the Himalaya Mountains and
is probably the only one of that fine va
riety in the United States, as it will live
only in semi-tropical climates. The
bloom is rich and beautiful and the spe
cies Is the finest known. In its native
state it grow? to a height of thirty to
forty feet. The trie was brought to the
park ten y?ars ago by William Alvord,

A young lady of my acquaintance in St. Louis was
fo^r a lono- time a chronic sufferer from dyspepsia. She
used to make use of a mixture prepared by the druggist
where the family traded, but one time when the supply
was exhausted and she was absent from home and had
not a copy of the prescription with her, she was at a loss
to know what to do and I recommended her to make
trial of Ripans Tabules. She purchased some and was so
greatly benefited by their use that she has been a regular
customer and a walking advertisement for them ever sinc^
who obtained the original sprig from a
well-known English botanist, who had
visited the Himalayas in search of rare
plants.
SWALLOWED CARBOLIC ACID.
Mrs. Dunne Objected to Her Husband
Going to the Masked Ball.
Mrs. Dunne, a young married woman
living at 924 Howard street, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital early yesterday
morning from Stockton and O'Farrell
streets suffering from carbolic acid poi
soning. She was treated by Dr. Fitzgib
bon and was able to be sent to her home
a few hours later.
Her husband wanted to g-o to the
masked ball in the Mechanics' Pavilion,
and she strongly objected. They had
some angry words on the subject, and
finally he used an expression that mad
dened her. He left her to co to the ball,
and she purchased a bottle of carbolic
add .and swallowed a portion of the con
tents, but not enough to lead to serious
consequences.
Mixed Up in a Fight.
N. R. Snow, 715 Bush street, was taken
to tho Receiving Hospital early yesterday
morning to have two ugly wounds in his
forehead stitched and dressed. He said
he was attacked by some men on Eddy
and Larkln streets and knocked down,
his forehead striking against the Bide
walk. He at first said the men attempted
to rob him, but later denied it. He was
considerably under the influence of liquor.

Such was" the recommendation made at
this morning's meeting of the Central
Christian Church, which practically dis
.bars Mr.- Davis from the ministry. There
is .ho appeal from this except to the min
isters of the State, and from the proposed
amendments, said to be ready for adop
â¢ tion by the ministerial meeting in San
' Francisco" to-morrow, he will not want to
appeal it.
â¢ .On Friday evening last a meeting of
the officers of the church was held at the
home of* Elder J. M. Weshart, who has
been one of Davis' stanchest friends. The
elders and deacons found there had been
â a large, amount of money paid into the
church : during the time that Davis was
the pastor, for which no account had been
given.- The total amounted to quite a sum.
The sensational part of the meeting was
the testimony of J. B. Gardner, who has
a grocery-store on the corner of Twelfth
and Market streets. He stated that on a
number of occasions he had seen Rev.
Edwards Davis in an intoxicated condi
tion. He mentioned several instances, one
being on th* death of his father, when he
went to see Davis about conducting the
services at the funeral. He says that
when he went to Davis' study and
knocked on the door he received no an
swer. He left, but coming back in a few
moments, heard voices inside. This time
he made a very emphatic demand for ad
mittance, which called forth the remark
â  from the preacher that he wanted to
. know "who in the was at the door."
He came to the door, and was abashed
to fina Gardner there. He apologized for
his intoxicated condition, and Gardner left
in disgust.
On another occasion Mr. Gardner says
"he saw the pastor of the Central Chris
tian Church go into a certain saloon on
"Washington street by the back entrance.
â¢ Gardner followed by way of the front
â  entrance, and as he entered he saw the
barkeeper and the minister arm in arm.
The following dialogue, he says, took
â  place: "Well, parson, what will you
take this morning?" said the mixer of
: drinks. "1. guess a whisky cocktail is
"good enough for me," responded the
' preacher â¢of the gospel. "Well, if a
whisky cocktail is good enough for the
pastor it is good enough for one of the
â¢flock." was the remark of Mr. Gardner,
â¢as he joined the duo at the bar.
The whole of Mr. Gardner's testimony
was made up of such incidents as this.
. Mr. Davis was also accused by the offi
cers of associating with loose characters.
They declared they had testimony to back
their assertion.
The heads of the church stated that this
was not the first time Dr. Davis had
been brought before them, but the set
he went with had everything to gain by
sticking to him, so no proof could be got
ten against him.
Before adjourning last evening severe
measures were decided upon.
This morning the officers met a.gain be
fore church and drew up the above quoted
recommendation. When presented to the
congregation it was unanimously adopted.
Among the subjects discussed Friday
evening was a postal card received Friday
morning by Rev. F. H. Sawyer, the
pastor, worded as follows:
Memoâ Be careful. You for a stranger
have gone too far with Edwards Davis,
who is a choice favorite with all classes
on this coast. If you don't be careful you
will get your head in your hand before
forty-eight hours. One is on your track.
You are jealous of Davis. Remember he j
is a native son of California. J. B.
"I said to my wife as I turned from the
. " door on receipt of thi.s," said Mr. Sawyer.

THEIR TROUBLES AT AN tND.
The Seceders from the First Chris
tian Church Have Organized
Another Congregation.
AMMEDA, May I.â The troubles of the
First Christian Church of Alameda are, in
one sense, over, while in another they
have only 'just begun. They are over in
asmuch as those who left the congrega
tion with the Rev. J. A. Wlckham have
cut themselves loose from the chur- h Jn
. a body and founded a congregation of
their own. The thirty or forty seceders
are now known as the Disciples of Christ,
and they worship in Holtz Hall, in the
West End. The Rev. Mr. Wickham and
his flock have cut loose entirely from the
Christian Church, and have now nothing

whatever to do with that communion,
save inasmuch as they are all followers
of the same Jesus.
The troubles of the First Christian
Church have only just begun, because
there is a heavy debt on the church and
there are only a few left to bear It. Then
the remnant is without a pastor, and as
'in its best days it took the congregation
all its time to keep even with the world,
it looks now as though it would sink
deeper into debt unless some of the richer
members left dip deep into their pockets.
Rev. Mr. Wlckham had quite a large
gathering in Holtz Hall last evening. It
seemed more like a large family party
than anything else, and it is rarely that
the services of the church are entered
into more heartily than they were last
evening. The reverend gentleman took
for his text the words of Christ to his
followers, "Lay not up for yourselves
treasures on earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt,' and preached an eloquent
sermon therefrom.

PALO ALTO'S ANNUAL.
For a number of years past, Court Palo
Alto, of the Foresters of America, has
annually given a ball to its friends, and
each of these has been a full dress affair,
to which none received Invitations except
the applicant's name was passed upon
by a committee. Last Friday night this
rinnual function was given in Golden Gate
Hall, and in addition to the Dall there
was a banquet at which were seated
about 175 persons. The grand march was
led by Chief Ranger Martin Meyer and
Miss Samuels, and at a quarter after 11
o'rlock the company, after two hours'
dancing, marched to the banquet hall. D.

TREND OF AMERICAN SOCIAL LIFE.
Woman's Congress Will Exemplify the Patriotism
of California at the Annual Sessions.
The fifth annual sessions of the Woman's Congress will convene at Native Sons' Hall this afternoon and continue
in sessions, in San Francisco, every afternoon and evening for four days, the remaining two days of the week
being given over to sessions in Stockton and San Jose, to meet the convenience and wishes of the members of the
association who reside near tbQM cities.
The Woman's CongreM is strictly a State organization of women who aim to educate the sex on the broadest
lines possible, in the giving of lectures and by the university form of Imparting instruction. The association has no
connection with Woman's Suffrage Clubs, nor is it in any way identical therewith; on the contrary, it Is simply an
institution of wide educational influence open to every woman who may desire to take advantage of the splendid
opportunities the association offers. Upon the annual payment of $1, any woman becomes a member In full standing
and entitled to a seat at the meetings and a seat for an escort at the evening meetings.
On account of the free conditions of congress the membership is very fluctuating, but has for the past few years
ranged as high as 1000 women. The meetings, however, are all well attended, there being large audiences present on
each occasion.
The programme, distributed between the eight meetings of the four daysâ May 2, 3, 4 and sâcontemplates5 â contemplates the
treatment of the one tdpie, "The Trend of American Social Life." This is presented under the three heads, "Social
Values," "Social Intercourse" and "Social Feeling." Each discussion, after belr.g opened by the paper or address of
one or more invited expert authorities, will be informally carried on by the audience. Among the names of those
designated as the leaders in the discussions of the coming Woman's Congress are President David Starr Jordan
and l'rofessor E. A. Ross of Stanford University, Professor G. Kriehn, Miss Mollie E. Connors, Mrs. Sara E. Gamble,
Mrs. E. A. Orr, Mrs. Mary Yarrow, Mrs. Mary Roberts Smith and Professor Duniway. The general theme is sub
divided into these heads: "Social Values in a Democracy," "Money Measurements of Men," "Anglomania and Its Anti
dotes," "American Amusements," "Bohemia and Philistia." "The Effect of Women's Clubs on Social Life," "The
Church as a Source of Fellowship," "Social Functions and the Newspapers," "The Sway of Fashion," "Social Exclu
siveness."

THE " SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 2, 189 S.
THE FREAK IN
COUNTY POLITICS
Debut of the Aspirant
Who Would Give All
to Charity.
Pinole's Ambition to Have the
County Convention Meets
With Opposition.
Work of the Grand Jury Likely to
Be Productive of Some Practi
cal Results.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cal
90S Broadway, May 1.
The freakish element in politics is now ;
coming to the front. The campaign began
bo early and threatened to become so dull
on account of the election being such a
long way off that a few who woulTi be
sacrificed have tried to relieve the monot
ony by being funny. One of these, while
hot new in politics, is always interesting. !
He has already announced that should he I
bo selected by the voters to take care of
the maimed and mysteriously dead of this
county he will give all the emoluments of
the office to the Associated Charities.
Such talk never did deceive anybody and
never will. Politics tor glory only is an
unknown quantity in Alameda County, j
and is so far removed from the practical
thing that no imagination on this side of
the bay can even comprehend it seriously.
The Associated Charities is a very
worthy body, does much good and Is
deserving ot all the assistance that may
be accorded it. But in spite of promises
of politicians, nobody believes that it will ;
receive the total amount of fees paid to
the Coroner who shall be In ottice from
1899 to 1903.
Apart from the palpable object of mak- j
ing such an announcement, it is not a pop- j
ular one. Neither the people of Alameda \
County nor the level-headed people of |
any other county want their public work
done for charity, and the practical con- |
elusion is that if men can be found who
consider the burden of being Coroner such
a trine that they can undertake it with
out any remuneration the salary had bet
ter be abolished, so that candidates need I
not play to the gallery when seeking the
nomination. Naturally, \yhen such an offer
is made the public mind asks, Why such
generosity? And if the boast is merely
a ]>ap thrown out to benefit the thrower
in another direction, then where is the j
excuse of disinterested charity?
Just across the border line of this
county is Pinole. In that town they make
gunpowder, and periodically the village
is severely shaken by fatal explosions.
In the little town there is an editor who
is justly ambitious. He is anxious to
boom Finole, but not with the kind of
boom that is usually associated with his
town and which extends to all the cities
around the bay. He is desirous that the
next county convention for Contra Costa
shall be held at Pinole. He pledges that
the town can be conveniently reached and
that candidates, and delegates will find
ample accommodation. This ambition has
been ridiculed by Editor Montgomery of
Martinez, who says that he does not be
lieve enough food could be found in
Pinole to entertain the delegates for a
whole day. The-Pinole man thus replies:
"We never entertained the idea fur a
moment you would rustle around as soon
as you landed and do nothing but eat all
day, but come to Pinole and we will take
care of you."
And in another part of the paper is a
little but very significant item of news.
It states that in view of the fact that two
powder works in different parts of the
country have recently blown up or been
blown up. Sheriff Veale has appointed five
special Deputy Sheriffs to guard the
works at Pinole. This situation cannot
help but create a favorable impression for
holding county conventions at Pinole.
Comparisons are odious, and the one I
am about to make is particularly odious.
However, it will not incur the displeasure
of the citizens who have done their duty,
and if it should incite those who have
been remiss, to do better, it will have
fulfilled a good purpose. A dispatch from
Bakersfield says: "The Chinese have
raised $1000 for their part of the celebra
tion that will be held here when the Val
ley road comes in. This class of our resi
dents seems to be actively interested in
railroad competition, inasmuch as they
paid a big sum toward securing the right
of way through the county."
Some years ago â only the records can
tell how manyâ Alameda and Contra Cos-
ta counties decided to construct a use
ful wagon road over or through the
Berkeley hills. Many men have done
splendid work in contributing by money,
land or labor, or all three, but they have
not met with anything like the encour
agement the project deserved, and the
road from which so much benefit is pro
phesied and will accrue, is still an imag
inary affair. It is not known how many
citizens of China reside in Bakersfield.
or the amount of their wealth, but it is
not to be supposed for a moment that it
compares at all with the population and
wealth of these two countries in the same
proportion as $1000 compares with $40,000,
which latter figure is the estimated cost
of the entire road and tunnel.
H. W. Lynch of Washington Township
deserves something, though, perhaps, oth
ers may deny his right to be the next
Superintendent of Schools. Mr. Lynch
has made public an interesting little docu
ment which sets forth that there are
many things required by a County Super
intendent. Such an official should be ac
quainted with the Interior of the coun
ty, he should advance tho interests of the
country schools, should he thoroughly
acquainted with and in sympathy with his
work and should also possess many other
needed accomplishments to fit him for the
office. And this very patriotic letter,
written no doubt in the interests of the
public schools of this county, concludes,
nfter recapitulation of the qualifications
with this modest sentence:
"In view of the above, suggestions, I
solicit your support at the coming prim
aries. H. W. LYNCH."
Tnfortunately for Mr. Lynch there are
about seven others who, according to
their personal estimates of themselves,
are equally fitted for the position.
Oakland has had a lot of ,fun with its
Grand Jury. But it must be admitted
that much of it was of a serious nature.
While it is not likely that San Quentm
will receive any new guests as the re
sult of the protracted inquiries, still the
work of the jurors has had a good ef
fect. The summoning of many of its
witnesses has aroused public attention un
til it became curious to dig below the
surface, and this it has been doing. In
fact, public opinion has gone farther be
low the surface than probably the Grand
Jury, and it has had its eyes opened to
many things of which it was previously
unaware. There is no doubt that when
Important measures like fixing water
rates come up they will receive the at
tention they deserve long before the time
when the Councilmen took them in hand.
They will be made matters to be passed
upon at conventions rather than mob
meetings, which are too late.
There are other chapters of Interest in
the doings of the Grand Jury. Some of
the prettiest of political work has been
attempted, but owing to the great promi
nence given to every action in the secret
chamber, many schemes carefully laid
have been frustrated.
In justice to some of those whose names
have been handled very freely in con
nection with alleged scandals, there Is
one idea that must not be entirely smoth
ered. It is that this is the last Grand
Jury to convene before the county con
ventions get to work, and this may ac
count in some measure for the earnest
ness that has been shown in certain direc
tions to secure certain results more in the
interest of politics than of honest re
form. STTART \V. BOOTH.
CLARK'S PROPERTY CLEARED.
Judicially Declared Daad When He
Was Aliva in an Insane Asylum.
OAKLAND, May I.â E. H. Morgan has
applied for and received an order of the
Superior Court vacating all proceedings
against George R. Clark. This became
necssary in order to clear Clark's title
to his own property, which had become
entangled through years of litigation.
Clark was committed to an insane asy
lum in Oregon. His wife came here and
years afterward had her husband de
clared judicially dead. She then admin
istered 'upon the estate. In some manner
it was later learned that Clark still lived.
She sought a divorce, but the law for
bade an insane party being a defendant
in such a proceeding, hence the case was
thrown out of court. Then he was de
clared legally alive and Mr. Morgan ap
pointed his " guardian, Clark being de
clared an incompetent person. He could
do nothing with the property, as it was
already distributed. The old order is now
Bet aside and Mr. Morgan will begin
anew with the property and try to keep
it in shape.

DAMAGED IN
THE NOR'WESTER
The Alden Besse Lost
Two of Her Boats
in the Gale.
No Cargo for the Steamer
Venus, Now Ready to Sail
for the Orient.
Sergeant Tom Mahoney Nearly Killed
Near the Ferries by a
Crazy Cow,
The bark Alden Besse, which got In
! from Honolulu yesterday, had a very hard
i time of it during the last four days of the
; voyage. She was caught in the north
| wester that delayed the Gaelic thirty-six
i hours, and she brought marks of the en
| counter into port with her. Two of her
! boats were smashed, her port railing was
i carried away # and the forecastle was
| flooded. The carpenter was washed out of
; his shop, the cook was nearly drowned in
1 the galley, and, all in all, everybody on
| board had a bad quarter of an hour.
Captain Porter's account of the trouble
was as follows: "Two days ago we were
chased by a Spanish cruiser. The rascals
fired two shots at us, both of which took
effect. Go and examine the damage for
yourself. I stood the fellow's nonsense
as long as possible, and then I cracked
all sail on my ship and ran him down.
Yes, sir, I ran him down, and that Spanish
cruiser, with all on board, went down.
That's one warship less for Uncle Sam
to fight, anyhow."
The two shots which took effect on the
Aiden Besse were two big seas which
broke aboard, one after the other, and did
all the damage. They swept clean through
the 'midship house and nearly took two
of the crew overboard with them. The
passeugers on the bark from Honolulu
were Mrs. and Miss Dayton and Mr. and
Mrs. Terwilliger.
The schooner Hattie I. Phillips, which
came around the Horn with a party of
Klondikers, has been sold by Captain
Blackburn to Cassidy & Snow of this city.
Some of the gold-hunters are going back
to their homes in the East, while the
others will start for the Yukon as soon
as the river opens.
The gasoline schooner Chetco is to be
put into the Kotzebue Sound trade. Cap
tain Dan McLean is going in command of
her. Last year the Chetco was put on
the berth for St. Michael, but stie did
not sail, as the boom died away. She has
now been brought out of retirement, and
will take a party to the new gold fields.
The steamer Acapulco arrived from
Panama and way ports yesterday w.ith
eleven cabin and sixteen steerage passen
gers. Everything was quiet in Central
American ports when the steamer was
there.
The tramp steamer Venus, chartered by
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company to replace the disabled Coptic,
will go out with hardly any freight in her
hold. The Rio de Janeiro could not take
away all the freight offering, and the
Gaelic will be full when she goes out, and
yet the Venus will go out practically
empty. It is said that the reason for this
state of affairs is due to Captain Mc-
Gregor having kept his vessel in quaran
tine for a week when he could have
docked the day after he came in by obey
ing the quarantine laws as laid down by
Dr. Rosenau. McGregor gained his point,
as his vessel was released without either
he or his men being fumigated,
but now the shippers will not allow their
goods in his vessel. In this way they are
getting even for having to wait a week
for goods they were urgently in need of.
John Roll in was run over by one of the
cars of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railway at Reed station yester
day and had his foot crushed. He was
brought to San Francisco on the steamer
Tiburon, and Drs. Hill and Zabala at
tended to his injuries at the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital.
Three cows and two calves created
quite a scene on East street, near the
ferries, yesterday. The animals got
I scared and would not lead. Then they
got angry and charged the crowd right
and left. Tom Mahoney had a narrow
escape, as a slight rip in his coat will
testify. One of the vaqueros lost part
of his pantaloons, while another was
knocked down but not badly hurt. It took
nearly an hour to get the crazy cattle
away from the ferries ar.d into a stable,
where they will be kept until the streets
are quiet.
The Harbor Hospital has proved a boon
to the water front since its establishment.
The doctors have been kept busy from the
start, but last month was the busiest of
all. In March 330 cases were treated,
but on Saturday night last the month of
April was five past the 400 mark.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the duys; those underneath It, if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow In Inches
and hundredths during the . ajt twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usuaily
first appear on the Washington ?oast. When
the pressure Is hiph In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia ccast. warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will croduo* an
opposite result.

The Foyer Had the Appearance of
an Ultra Respectable Junkshop
Yesterday Morning.
â  Amid the uproar and confusion which
followed the discovery of flra in the
building adjoining the California Thea
ter on Saturday evening there was one
man who retained his coolness, but for
â¢which fact many lives might have been
. crushed out in the mad rush to leave
the building.
Fred Seitz, the man who handles the
drums, cymbals, xylophone, bells and
what not in the opera company's or
chestra, was the hero of the occasion.
He did not follow his portly leader or
his fellow players in a wild clamber
over the footlights, but grasping the
dangers of a general stampede re
mained at his post, and beating time
on his snare drum quieted the excited
multitude into an orderly march to the
various exits. Before this the audi
ence was pushing and crushing in an
endeavor to leave the theater, but
â when Seitz's drum beats were heard
chaos was turned into order, and keep-
ing step to the taps of the drum the
building was soon emptied.
In their hurry to reach places of I
safety wearing apparel and articles of i
every description were left behind or j
dropped in their flight. Thirty-seven I
.. sealskins, seventeen black and colored j
flchus, twelve pair of gloves, twenty- j
seven pair of opera glasses, nineteen
ladies' hats, twelve umbrellas, thirty
two gentlemen's assorted hats, nine
hatpins, fifty handkerchiefs, seventeen
overcoats, eleven canes, four pair of
rubbers, keys, glasses, lorgnettes, purses '
and other things too numerous to men
tion were gathered up by employes of
the theater and placed on a long table
in the foyer. The appearance of the
. latter place yesterday morning resem- j
bled a second-hand clothing store, and
to carry out the idea business was
opened by Manager Friedlander at 9
o'clock. Standing in line, anxious to
recover their belongings and eager to
gain admittance were representatives j
of both sexes. One by one they weie
.. allowed to examine the contents on ex
". hibition, generally finding what they
.â¢ .looked for. Many, however, were dis
appointed, as their belongings had
"been either taken by excited persons |
â¢ â¢or picked up Rv a gang of vultures j
who gained access to the theater
â¢ through the Pine street exit during the
â¢" excitement. Purses and silk hats were
their , prey, and before they could be
driven off they had succeeded in reap
ing a harvest.
Over 300 people visited the California
during the day inquiring for lost arti
cles. Some were made happy, while
many were disappointed. Mayor Phe
lan reported the loss of a diamond star
brooch worn by his mother at th-j per
formance and valued at $1500. So far it
has not been recovered.
Janitor John Beguhl has been com
plimented for the nervy stand lie took
when a wildly excited, Individual
climbed the long flights leading to the
gallery breathlessly yelling fire in his
ascent. John met him half way, which
was lucky for the alarmer as he only
had that distance to fall. Catching
him by the scruff of the neck and firm- ,
ly grabbing him by the trousers, Be
guhl threw him down the stairs and
calmly returned to his station In the
. gallery quieting the fears of the audi
ence and preventing a calamity.
George H. Meyers, the young man who
occupies the seat in the box office at the
California, was astonished early in the
day when a man, who claimed to have
attended the performance the night be
fore, demanded the return of $1 as he
â¢ had only witnessed half the perform
ance. When Mr. Meyers could regain
his speech, he politely but firmly re
fused the demand, and the stranger j
moved away from the box office mut- [
tering about the Injustice of things.
Manager Friedlander Is disgusted
with the lack of courage shown by the
male element during the stirring
scenes on Saturday night. He said he
expected as much, as past experience j
has taught him that men are greater |
cowards than women. He bears this ,
statement out by pointing to the greater
number of hats and overcoats left by j
them in their rush to escape danger.
He said the men acted shamefully.
Mothers, wives and sisters were left to
care for themselves. Why they should
have been in such a rush to leave the
theater when there was no danger and
plenty of exits puzzled Mr. Friedlander
at the time, but after reflection he laid j
â¢it to their cowardice.
> An inspection of the St. George Sta- '
ble,, in which the fire occurred shows j
that the damage is not quite as bad as j
It was at first supposed to be. The.en
" tire roof was destroyed and a portion
of the side walls injured, all of which !
will have to be repaired. To do this i
about $2000 will fully cover the entire |
damage. Mr. Seymour, the , owner of |
the building, allowed his insurance of j
$10,000 to lapse a few months ago, con- ]
sequently the entire loss will fall on his j
own shoulders.
The firemen have suffered somewhat |
from smoke and water ! which found
a way into ' their quarters from the I
stable adjoining, damaging the cloth- j
ing and bedding of the men. While the
quarters of Chief Sullivan on the upper j
floor were thoroughly soaked and per- !
fumed the gallant Chief is too j much I
of a fire hero to complain. The only
grievance he has is that his parrot got
a dose of stifling . smoke and an - occa
sional shower from the spray, of the |
water thrown on the building. The
Chief values this bird very highly, as
it is a great > pet and the idol of * the |
household. Mrs. Sullivan loves the bird !
for. Its cleverness. Every time the gong j
sounds In the engine-house the parrot |
cries out: â fireâ youâ sonâ i
oâgun."0 â gun." On the occasion of the blaze j
Saturday night it screeched out "Fire â I
fire" long before the men in the engine
house knew of the danger.

CYCLERS READY
FOR THE RELAY
Preliminary Work Ended
With Two Tryouts
Yesterday.
Committee Renders a Report
on the Condition of the
Roads.
Enclnal Cyclers Hold an Exeitinu
Race on the Haywards
Road.
Everything is now In readiness for the
great annual cycling event of the Pacific-
Coast, the 100-mile relay race, which will
take place next Sunday.
Chester S. Myrick, chairman of the road
racing committee of the California As
sociated Cycling Clubs, rode around the
entire course yesterday, accompanied' by
H. D. Hadenfeldt, W. Mackie, F. G.
Montealegre and G. W. Tantau. The re
port of the gentlemen shows the road to
be in exceptionally good condition, and
all expressed the opinion that faster time
would be made next Sunday than ever
before in the history of the race.
Frora now on the roads are to be sprin
kled every day. The worst stretch is to
be encountered on the second relay, where
the road for two miles south from Uncle
; Tom's Cabin is a mass of soft earth, from
| the effects of the recent digging of a wide
! trench Dy the Spring Valley Water Com
! pany. From Mountain View to San Jose,
! being most of the fifth relay, is also in
I poor shape. Had the race been naden
early in April this year, according to the
custom in the past, the greatest difficul
i ties would have been encountered where
I now the roads are smooth and fast.
Furman, who will ride in the Bay City
team, arrived from Los Angeles yester
day, and Freeman came in from Fresno
to train for a place on the Acme team.
T. C. Belloli was appointed yesterday by
Chairman Myrick to represent the C. A.
C. C. in an executive capacity at the San
Jose end of the road on the day of tht
race.
The Garden City Wheelmen of San Jose
held a ten-mile try-out yesterday, as a
result of which the following riders were
chosen for the San Jose team: Harden
brook, Delmas, Thome, J. Smith, Bunt
Smith, Francis. Quimby, Bridgeman, Bel
loli and Schnitzpan.
The Acme Wheelmen held a ten-mile
try-out over the Haywards course, start
ing at 2 o'clock. Fifteen men were started
in one bunch, all the relay riders partici
pating and live extra men being added to
conceal the exact identity of the relay
men. A. T. Smith finished first in 25:30.
Curtis was thrown out of the race by
reason of a fall when but two miles out.
and J. E. Smith, one of the Acme Club's
brightest stars, was left behind on ac
count of an unfortunate puncture.
The five-mile road race of the Encinal
Cyclers was started at 2 o'clock from San
Leandro. Twelve men started, and all
finished. H. F. Ross, a new rider, riding
from the 1:30 mark, put up an excellent
ride, and finished in first position several
yards in front of a bunch of long mark
men. The four scratch men came in to
gether, and as they approached the tape
excitement ran high, and there seemed to
be no choice as to the best man. Jurgt-
witz started a sprint, at which the others
jumped immediately, but the tape was
in too close proximity, and Jurgewitz
passed it first, with Thompson, Hurley
and Cummlngs behind him in the order
named and only fifths of a second apart.
Jurgewitz' s time of 13:59 was the best of
the day, and he was awarded the first
time prize. ML G. Curtis did not ride, on
account of being entered in the Acme
relay try-out. Had he ridden In the En
cinal race instead he would undoubtedly
have covered himself with glory, as he
was in unusually fine form. W. F. Cran
dall acted as referee and H. O. Tenney
as chief timer. The summary follows:

on "The Investment of Power," a ser

The great May-day coursing at Union.
Park brought out the lovers of the sport
in large numbers. Ordinarily the crowd
does not arrive until the third round, but
early yesterday morning it began to pack
the park for the first races.
The sport was of the best. The hares
full of life and vigor, gave the hounds a
merry chase, and some of the prettiest
races of the season were run, both In
the preliminary and the last rounds. The
'.â hampion stake was won by the great
iiound, For Freedom, who took every race
easily. All of For Freedom's successes
were well earned, and the running yes
terday shows the hound a veritable cham-

proved the winners.
The crowd was one of the largest this
year, and the betting was very brisk, j
The ring was packed with a crush of bet

INGLESIDE.
A good-sized crowd saw some fairly
clever sport at the Ingleside Coursing
Park yesterday. Although the money was
loose during the day much fault was
found by the bettors at two or three de
cisions given during the racing. Moon
dyne seemed hard to beat according to
rumors, for the reason that the park in
terest in the hound wanted the money to
go that direction, and after a diecislon
in the third ties for a no go the hound
went down to Koo Lawn, who proved to
be the winner of the rich stake. The
hounds were all in good condition, as
were the hares. It is stated that the long
odds book lost heavily on the results, as
it was generally supposed that one of the
swift Dean hounds would win the money.
The results follow:
Patria beat Senorita, Koo lawn beat Glen
Chloe, Moondyne beat Right Bower, Log Boy
beat Lady Blanche, Firenza beat Rusty Gold.
Second tiesâ Koo Lawn beat Patria. Moon
dyne beat Glen Roy, Log Boy beat Firenza.
Third tiesâ Koo Lawn beat Moondyne, Log
Boy a bye.
Finalâ Koo Lawn beat Log Boy and won the
money. __^ â -^â â
Sergeant McManus' First Haul.
The first haul made by Sergeant Mc-
Manus and posse, who has taken the
place of Sergeant Shea on the Chinatown
squad, was booked yesterday at the Cali
fornia-street station. This was the raid
ing of an opium joint on Clay street
which the white population has been in
the habit of patronizing. In yesterday's
raid the following were caught: William
McDonald, George Jones, Frank Silvey,
John King, Joseph Maria. James Scott,
Charles Mason and R. Gillogley. The
Mongolian who conducted the layout was
also bagged, as were the pipes and opium.
REVENUE BILL
COMES FIRST
Interestinthe Senate Cen
ters on the War
Measure.
Democrats Desire to Submit
Several Very Important
Amendments.
An Inheritance Tax and the Issuance
of Greenbacks Among the
Probable Suggestions.
I __
Special Dispatch to f The Call.
Call Office, Rigffs House,
Washington, May 1.
Interest in the Senate this week is in
the war revenue bill, which is expected
to reach that body with the beginning
of the week. It will be referred at once
to the Committee on Finance, and
probably, will be reported Wednesday
or Thursday.
A meeting of the Finance Committee
has been called for Monday, with the
view on the part of the Republican
members of having the consideration |
of the bill in committee begun infor
mally. They have even intimated that |
they may ask that a vote be taken at
this meeting with the view of report
ing the bill as soon as it is referred.
The Democratic members of the com
mittee will oppose this programme, as
they desire an opportunity to have va
rious amendments considered. It is
now believed that they will offer a
provision for a tax on all producing
industries, another for an inheritance
tax, and a third for non-interest bear
ing treasury notes. It is also probable
that an amendment will be suggested
for the issuance of $100,000,000 in green
backs to take the place of those out
standing which are supposed to have
been destroyed. They will seek to have
the bond provision of the bill eliminat
ed entirely on the plea that the time
has not yet arrived for a bond issue.
There is a possibility that the Repub
lican members of the committee may
amend the bond provision, as there is
more or less dissatisfaction with it
among Republican Senators. One of
the changes suggested is a reduction of
the amount of the bonds. When the
bill reaches the Senate the opposition
will insist upon having time for the
various factions to state the reasons
for their opposition, and it is now pre
â¢ dieted that two weeks will be required
for debate. While they will insist upon
the elimination of the bond feature
they will all state that they will vote
for bonds later if the waar should be
prolonged sufficiently to require their
Issuance.
The programme of the Senate until
the revenue bill is reported is uncer
tain. The postofflce appropriation bill
probably will be reported and passed
and the omnibus claims bill will be
taken up.
WASHINGTON, May I.â There Is no
business of great importance to come
before the House during the week, un
less the Appropriations Committee
brings in an emergency war appropri
ation measure. It was the intention of
Chairman Cannon to make the emer
gency appropriations a part of the gen
eral deficiency, but as th,at bill might
be delayed some time he may bring in
a separate measure. There are also a
number of conference reports to be dis
posed of and these may occupy the
House during the week. Special ap
propriation bills are still in confer
ence, but reports are expected during
the week. The Alaska land bill remains
to be disposed of. and there are a num
ber of minor matters to be taken under
consideration.
In the public schools of Japan the Eng
lish language is required to be taught by
law. The Japanese youth in the open
ports and commercial cities are all eager
to learn English as a passport to wealth,
position and employment.
TOPEKA NOW
SAFE IN PORT
The Old Diogenes Makes
the Run Across in
Rough Weather.
Series of Storms Encountered
During the Trip Over From
Falmouth.
No Warships of the Enemy Encoun
tered, Much, to the Relief of
Commander Knapp.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May I.â The United
States cruiser Topeka, formerly the
Diogenes, commanded by Lieutenant
J. J. Knapp, which sailed from Fal
| mouth, England, April 19, arrived safe
j ly in port this morning, after a rough
; passage of twelve days. The Topeka
entered the Narrows at 9 a. m., where
she slowed down for the Health Of
ficer's inspection, then proceeding to
the man-of-war anchorage off Tomp
kinsville. As she steamed up the bay
the vessel presented an odd appear
ance. She has a high-sided, black
painted hull and two yellow funnels, j
from which the paint had washed off
by heavy weather. She is brig-rigged,
giving her a heavy appearance aloft,
without fighting tops; in fact, at a dis
tance she presents the appearance of a
big cargo steamer rather than a war
vessel. The cruiser's deck is entirely
bare of guns, all her equipments being
stowed in the hold.
Lieutenant Knapp reported having
I experienced a very rough passage.
| From the time of leaving the channel
| up to the banks a succession of strong
I westerly gales was encountered. After
| passing the banks the wind hauled to
! the north and blew a strong gale for
! four days, with a very rough sea. The
Topeka behaved well throughout and
sustained but trifling damage about
the decks. The cruiser carries a crew
of forty-six men all told. Lieutenant
Knapp, when asked whether he had
sighted any war vessels during the
I voyage, replied that he had not and
I was not anxious to meet any, owing to
I his small crew and the fact that the
| Topeka's guns were not mounted. The
i Topeka was saluted by several tugs
and excursion boats as she steamed up
to her anchorage.
The Topeka was formerly known as
the Diogenes. She was built for the
i Peruvian Government at Kiel, Ger
| many, but never was completed. She
i was taken in part payment by the
Thames Iron Works, who fitted out her
sister ship, the Isosthenes. and was
formally purchased from that company
by the United States Government. She
is being rigged with a pretty high free
board, which makes her heavy looking
above the water line. She is an excel
lent sea boat and can sustain a speed
of sixteen knots.
Shortly after noon to-day the re
cently purchased cruiser New Orleans
passed the Topeka, heading for the
lower bay, and greetings were ex
changed and the flags dipped. This
was the first sight of a war vessel
which the officers and men of the To
peka had seen since they left British
waters.
When seen to-day by a correspondent
Knapp could not be induced to make
any statement regarding the vessel or
as to what her movements will be
within the next few days, further than
to say that he had a very rough pas
sage, during which the Topeka behaved
splendidly, and her battery has yet to
be determined. It is understood, how
ever, that her main battery will con
sist of 6 Inch and 4.7 rapid-fire guns.
Jilted by His Girl.
James Massey, a colored man, was
taken from a saloon on Hayes and La
guna streets to the Receiving Hospital
in the ambulance yesterday afternoon.
He said he had swallowed about seven
grains of morphine because his girl had
gone back on him. The doctors could
find no trace of poison and thought that
Massey was suffering iii>re from liquor.
He was put to bed, as he felt sure he was
going to die. He said he was employed
by Mrs. Rayfleld, 673 Hayes street.
Kifled a Trunk.
Joseph Elnreth, 640 Stevenson street, re
ported to the police yesterday that Satur
day afternoon during the temporary ab
sence of his wife some one had taken a
trunk from one of the bedrooms to *.ne
cellar, and after breaking it open had
stolen $40 in gold coin. He accused one
of his boarders, but after an investiga
tion no evidence could be procured to lead
to the arrest of the man suspected.

Oakland Citizens Enthu
siastic in the Work of
the Red Cross League.
. â¢ OAKLAND, May I.â A most enthusias
tic meeting of citizens interested in the
â¢work of the Red Cross Society was held
this afternoon at the First Congrega
tion;!] Church. The large auditorium of
the building was crowded when Rev. C.
K. Brown; the pastor of the church,
.opened the proceedings. -:â¢ .â¢ .-'_.;.:/
f here was no need for him to tell what
the meeting was called for. Hanging
OAKLAND'S CITIZENS INDORSE THE RED CROSSJ-EAGUE.
conspicuously among the decorations on
the platform was the emblem of human
ity that is recognized by all the civilized
nations of the world, and it expressed
more than any of those present could
'speak in a day.
In the gallery to the right of the plat
form were about two hundred of the
members of the Red Cross League of the
Lincoln School, under the leadership of
their principal, T. O. Crawford, and each
of them wore the red cross emblem of the
society. On the platform wore Rev. F. K.
â¢"Bushnell, ' pastor of the English Luth
eran Church; Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille. pastor
of â¢ thÂ«~First Methodfst Episcopal Church;
â¢ Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean, president of the
Pacific Theological Seminary: . Rev. R.
Ritchie, rector of St. Paul's Episcopal
Church: Rev. C. H. Hobart, pastor of the
First Baptist Church; Rev. Dr. Fried
lander rabbi of the First Hebrew Congre
gation; Rev. Thomas E. Williams, pastor
of the First Unitarian Church; Rev. Dr.
R. F. Boyle, pastor of the First Presby
terian' Church; Rev. J. S. Wallace, ex
chaplain of the United States navy, and
Colonel John P. Irish.
The meeting was opened by singing the
national anthem, and then Mrs. Oran
ville Abbott, the president of the Oakland
Red Cross Society, was called on to tell
of the -object and aims. of the organiza
tion She said the movement was born
In the hearts of women in days almost
forgotten. The Red Cross had its in
spiration in humanity. The present so
ciety as it stood In Oakland, she said,
was commenced almost simultaneously
by a literary society and the school chil
dren of the City, and the mass meeting
was in a measure to recognize the chil
dren in the movement : and to encourage
them in the y work tlv-y had undertaken.
She announced thai .to-morrow at 10
o'clock a meeting would be held in the
; rooms of . ; the Ebell Society to devise
.means of co-operating 'with' the naltonal
r society, so that assistance "can be sent
from California to help the work v under
- taken .by Clara ; Barton in Cuba and to
help in the movement of providing - the
California contingent of volunteers that
may be ordered to the -battle-fields. ;.:-â 
â  Professor T. O. Crawford, principal of
the Lincoln School, told the history. of tliej
RÂ«d Cross since its inception at the time
of tin- Crusades, and outlined the worK
it had accomplished during the progress
of the world. He was followed by two
of his pupils in short recitations, ex
plaining the work they were expected to
perform as members of the organization.
The addresses, of the speakers wore
limited to five minutes each, and the nrst
called on was Rev. R. Richie. 4<
"There are many here," he said, who
can recall with great distinctness the
struggle this nation passed through a
few years ago. I can recollect then the
families that were divided against each
other in the strife. Father fought against
.son and brother against brother In this
struggle we will stand united. There will
be no North nor no South. There will be
no distinction of- sects or creeds and be
fore the war is closed we will have de
clared to the world the humanitarian
principles of this nation. In the present
struggle we who are non-combatants
can furnish the sinews of war. W e in our
patriotism will submit to Pâ¢Per tax<>s
and tax ourselves voluntarily in our
seal for our nation's cause. We are here
io-dav to Indorse the society now organ-
IrineTand to give our support- to those
Â . ' v be called from among us to
â  . the fever stricken land of Cuba,
s Â co to succor the sick and wounded
who may be ordered to the front in the
defense of the principles of our flag and
in the cause of humanity.
"All of us no doubt believe war should
not" exist." said Rev. J. K. McLean when
ho Btepped out on the platform. There,
are none here but who think that this
war could have been averted. The pres
ent struggle was brought on us by an ex
cited press and jingoism in Congress. This
meeting is for peace and for it I can only
sTeak of the â¢rk of the Christian Com
mission during the late Civil I
served with that commission, and I can
recollect the great good it was able to
acoompllsh." .
Ex-Chaplain Wallace of the United
States navy followed. He was one of the
professors of the Annapolis Naval Col
lege and Captain Sampson who is now
n command of the blockading fleet at
Havana, was one of his pupils Some
people believe the navy wants to fight,
he said "1 do not believe there Is an
officer in the American navy who wants
war if it can be avoided. If America had
been prepared for war immediately on
making her first demand there wou d
haVe been no war now with Spain. Spain
would not have dared attack America,
and she would have ceased her atroci
ties in Cuba at the first warning this
country would have given had she be-
Ueved America was ready to force the
demand. I do not believe there will ever
be a time when there will not be war.
Man is so constituted that he is a fight
ing animal. I do not agree with Dr. Mc-
Lean I believe in this war from the bot
tom of my heart. It will be the most glo
rious war ever fought on the earth's sur
fVcf. Every expedient to avert war in
this cafe "as exhausted. Spain is fight
ing now- to preserve her position on the
throne and I believe with President Mc-
Kinlev that his conscience is clear on the
Soint of where the responsibility rests for
this struggle. Now that war has come
we must do our part as citizens to bring
victory to us and to fight the battle for
humanity on humanitarian grounds.
Rev Thomas C. Williams was the next
speaker. "War Has begun," he said. '^\e
cannot now ask the reason why. Our
country has spoken and the flag has
been unfurled in battle. We as Americans
must follow wherever it goes. My father
served with the Sanitary Commission dur
ing the Civil War. I remember him when
he came home, a fever-stneken and
health-broken man. I hope none of Cali
fornia's contingent will have to dare such
a fate. We are all patriots, but the Red
Cross is more than that. It is humanit:
Cuba has sent up a sufferine cry, ana
the Red Cross that represents the prin
ciples of Americanism should respond to
the call for help in its hour of need.
"I belong to a race that for over 2000
years has been a race of war. I should
bÂ« the last one to voice the sentiment of
our nation. This war we are now en
gaged In Is a Just one. Civilization must
advance. The voice of the country calls
upon us to demonstrate our patriotism.
We have taken up the cause of human
freedom. Let us organize at once, so that
if our armies should suffer we would be
ready to succor them. Let us be ready
to minimize the sufferings of war and
add to the glory of our victory.
"The Civil War marked in history the.
high water mark of humanityâ one nation
divided and warring with itself for an
other nation. The present strife is a
people at war for another race. The ( ivil
war could have been averted, but whether
this could or not it is not for me now
to say. The Hag is now at the front and
we will follow it. We are here to prepare
to alleviate the sufferings of those who
offer their lives for the cause of human
ity. It is a noble work we are undertak
ing. The Red Cross knows no friend or
foe. There is work to be done in Cuba
for those who enrol! under the emblem of
peace. 1 hope there will be no bloodshed,
but if there should be we should stand
ready to do our duty."
The work of the Red Cross, under the
leadership of Florence Nightingale and
Clara Rarton. was the subject of the
addresses given by Rev. F. E. Bushnell,
Rev. C. H. Hobart find Rev. R. F. Coyle.
"We. have gone into a struggle that will
call up all our resources," said John P.
Irish. "Spain is going to fight. Her peo
ple are brave and we have challenged
them to dismember their kingdom. It Is
well we should begin the organization of
this great society. This struggle will not
be closed in a few weeks or a few months.
It may last for years. We who cannot
go to war must organize, and do our duty
to our country when our services are
most needed."
At the meeting of the society to be held
on Monday at the Ebell Society's rooms
representatives are invited from all the
religious, fraternal and social organiza
tions of the city.

Professor Thomas R. Bacon spoke brief
ly upon the work of the society. He said,
"War is the most terrible of human ex
periences, but at certain points in the evo
lution of a race, war becomes inevitable.
No great question In human history has
ever been finally settled except by war.
"Existing circumstances illustrate this.
We now have on hand a war which no
body wanted. Little as we, individually,
wanted it. the Government wanted it
least. But force of circumstances and the
drift of human progress have brought us
to a situation where there is no course
open but war. It is our duty to carry
the war through as speedily and as thor
oughly as possible.
"Vet evon though no great principle
may be settled by it, the war has some
compensatory advantages. For the last
half century there has been a constant
growth in the humanitarian sentiments of
mankind. Beginning with the work of
Miss Nightingale in the Crimean War,
there has been a growing tendency on
the part of the civilians who do not fight
to aid those who do. The growth of this
spirit has culminated in the establish
ment of the association of the Red Cross.
"The Rod Cross is the symbol of a new
crusade, whose purpose is not to make
war, but in a Christ-like way to stretch
out a helping hand to heal the sick, to
care for the wounded and to comfort the
bereaved. This new opportunity for ex
pressing the noblest impulses within us
comes to us only through the opportunity
which war affords us. It draws into a
closer brotherhood the members of the
association â a brotherhood in which all
hold out the helping hand to the sufferer.
Nothing appeals to what is noble in man
more strongjy than does the Red Cross
Association. '
Rev. John Coyle, pastor of Trinity
Methodist Church, related a number of
experiences in the Sanitary Commission
of the army of the Potomac during the
Civil War.
"History repeats itself, he declared.
"The Red Cross Association will follow
in the steps of the Sanitary Commission.
If this war succeeds in doing nothing
more than impressing upon the minds of
our young people the lessons of patriot
ism "all the money, time and toll spent
upon the Red Cross movement will have
been well expended."
The following delegates were appointed
to represent the Berkeley society at the
great Red Cross meeting in San Fran
cisco; Rev. John Coyle, DD., Professor
Thomas R. Bacon, Mrs. G. W. Haight and
Mrs. C. B. Bradley.
The audience joined In singing a stanza
of "America," and the meeting adjourned
MRS. GRANVILLE ABBOTT.
The Energetic President of the Red Cross
Society of Oakland.
till next Sunday afternoon at 4:30 o clock,
which time, it is expected, word will have
been received from Miss Clara Barton
suggesting the nature and method of the
work which the society will undertake.
ODD FELLOWS AT CHURCH.
Annual Thanksgiving Sermon De
livered by Bey. W. B. Anderson
Last Night.
Rev. W. B. Anderson, at Bethel African
M. E. Church last evening, delivered an
eloquent sermon upon the beauties of Odd
Fellowship as exemplified in the practical
work of the order, the occasion being
the annual thanksgiving services, partici
pated in by Golden Gate Lodge 2007 and
Aerial Lodge 2442, G. U.O. of O. F. His text
was from the book of Samuel: "The soul
of Jonathan knit to the rfoul of David,
and Jonathan loved him as his own soul'
The pastor opened his discourse with a
description of the origin of Odd Fellow
ship, saying: "It was established by the
Roman soldiers, l%.pamp, after the order
of the Israelites, during the reign of Nero,
the Roman Emperor, A. D. 55, at which
time they were called Fellow Citizens.
Titus Caesar, Emperor of Rome, gave
them the name of Odd Fellows and at the
same time, as a pledge of friendship, pre
sented them with a dispensation ana
many smybolical emblems of the order
used at that time. . â â _ â .
"The Grand United Order of Odd I; el
lows was first instituted in America,
among the people of African descent, in
1843, at which time many of the race were
held in bondage, and being uneducated
they knew little of the arts of civilization
and the principles of Christianity. It was
during this period of oppression of the
negro that the order was established in
this country, coming as, a messenger of
love and good will to the race and spreao
ing the principles of friendship, love and
truth throughout the world."
In conclusion the pastor ?aid: To Pro
duce the good works of Odd Fellowship
there must be an interior spirit working
out for itself this living form and action;
the spirit of universal fraternity pervad
ing all the rituals and ceremontes recog
nized in the emblems, colors and regalia,
all strengthening the influence of the soul,
speaking to the eye in every lecture,
charge and token, and to the touch in the
grip and pressure, and silently manifest-
Ing itself like rain and sunshine." .
An extended programme, participated in
by the members of the order, preceded the
sermon.
Two Artistes Meet.
Yesterday i afternoon :In ; the parlors t of
the Palace ; , Hotel â¢ Mme.;Melba extended
a hand 1 of . true welcome to that charming
little pianiste and poser. ;Paloma
Schramm. The diva was desirous of being
present at Paloma's" last , performance ;on
Saturday. , but as J her car 'did not â , arrive
in the city until 5 o'clock she was unable
to do so, and i requested the meeting of
yesterday be arranged. ;: . . . - "
Those '?. who; are acquainted ' :â¢; with , ,the
marvelous musical ability of Palomarwill
not he surprised ;T ; upon } being informed
that '. even this distinguished prima : donna
has fallen captive before her.*;." After, hear
ing the child improvise upon a motif
which, she handed: her, ; and t upon hearing
her | playing of â  some "of the works =of ; t he
great masters, Melba threw up hex. iiands
and exclaimed, "I never heard anything
like this in all my life. Marvelous!"
Photos of the two were 'then taken,
Paloma sitting upon Meltia's lap and
again in other positions.
ROBBED OF AN ORANGE.
Brutal Attack on a Boy by Two
Youthful Criminals.
Willie Davidson, aged 12 years, visited
the City Prison last night for the purpose
of identifying Roche and Terrill, the
young men who were recently arrested
for assaulting an old man with intent to
rob.
Several weeks ago young Davidson was
walking along Twenty-second street,
when he was accosted by two young men.
who attempted to rob him of an orange
which 'ie *os eawng. The boy refused to
part wr.h tlio r.ange. whereupon one Oi
the men struck him with his clenched
fist, breaking his nose. They then grab
bed the orange and ran away.
After the arrest of Roche and Terrill
the police concluded that they were the
men who had assaulted Davidson, and
last night they had him visit the prison
to identify them. After carefully looking
at the .suspects the boy said they were
not the right men. From the descrip
tion given o" the man who struck young
Davidson the police are now inclined to
believe that he at one time served a term
in the Industrial School, and that he was
recently a; rested on a charge of an at
temp at robbery. As his companion is
also kmw 1 the detectives are hopeful of
catching them.

It Was Children's Day.
There was no happier minister in the
city yesterday than the Rev. Edwin 11.
Jenks, assistant pastor of the First Pres

white cut roses, while the little ones oc
cupied seats on the platform iand sang

In the evening Rev. Mr. Jenks^ dis
coursed on "Honor." taking that theme
for his subject, "We are. he said in
clined to associate this word with that
which makes a show. A popular hero
is ushered in with brass bands he wears
epanlettes, or holds -office. My thought
is of that high moral excellence, that
manly virtue, - which knows and j esteems
itself. It matters not whether it has a
title; it needs no herald. A man is con
scious of an indwelling worthiness that
makes him a king upon the earth and
an heir of heaven whose title is undis
puted, provided he himself does not. by
any act of his own, forfeit that right to
everlasting happiness."
"Let None Be Weal^-Kneed."
Rev. Oliver C. Miller preached yester
day at Pentecost Mission, corner of Pa
cific and Lijavenworth streets, from Luke
x. 37: "Then said Jesus unto him. go, and
do thou likewise." He said in part:
The present war crisis forcibly recalls the
Inimitable and oft-quoted parable of the Good
Samaritan. Poor Cuba fell among thieves,
who stripr>ed her of her raiment, wounded
her and left her half dead. The nations of the
earth passed her by, some on one side and
some on the other, till at last. Good Samari
tan like, America had compassion upon her
and went to her relief, preaching the gospel of
the golden rule In the thundering tones of her
mlKhty instruments of war.
Whosoever opposes the war that the cause
of humanity and justice have brought upon
us opposes the teachings of the parable. Let
us cease our talk about the sons of America
giving their lives for the enslaved and de
grade,! Cubans, for God Is no respecter of
persons He made of one blood all the nations
of the earth. The more helpless and down
trodden our father's children are the more our
duty to lift them up, even though they he not
sufficiently tutored to appreciate what we are
doing for them. Who are we that the Creator
of worlds should die for us? Yet the good
book tells us that He loved us and s^.ve him
self for us. In the present war America is
but carrying out tn e commands of mercy and
enacting over agraln the parable of the Good
Samaritan Savior. Our only regret is that she
had to be thrust into this act of mercy by th*
sacrifice of 266 precious lives. Let us enter
the conflict with the assurance that we cannot
go alone, but cheered by the words of our
Good Samaritan Savior, "I am with you al
way even unto the end." The unanimity with
which Congress declared war ought also to he
to us a source of comfort. Let the crisis make
the man and cnll out the heroic element in
American character. Let none be weak-kneed,
but let us as States stand by our Governors
and as Integral parts of our nation stand by
our President: and the mighty God of Jacob
shall be our helper.
