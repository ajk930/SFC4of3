THE MINISTER FROM SPAIN
WILL BE ORDERED HOME
WHEN McKINLEY
QUESTIONS SPAIN'S
TITLE TO CUBA
A Simple Resolution of Intervention, Ac
cepted by the President, Will Break
Diplomatic Relations.
Queen Regent Will Abdicate if Her Ministers Betray
Spanish Honorâ From the White House
Comes the Threat of a Veto.
LONDON, April 14.â The
Madrid correspondent of the
Morning Post, telegraphing
by way of Biarritz, says :
The Queen Regent has in
formed members of her court
that it is her intention to ab
dicate immediately if the
Cabinet takes any steps de
rogatory to Spain's honor
and dignity."
According to a special dis
patch from Madrid the su
preme council of state has
authorized Senor Gullon,
Foreign Minister, to order the
Spanish Minister at Wash
ington, Senor Polo de Bar
nabe, to return to Spain di
rectly President McKinley
accepts "any resolution of
Congress which attacks
Spain's sovereignty in Cuba."
The Vienna correspondent
of the Daily Mail says : "Sev
ern! European powers, in
cluding Austria, are reported
to have advised Spain to de
clare war, because further
delay or concessions would
te likely to provoke revolu
tion."
MADRID, April 14.â Ministers,
dipl< . ankers, brokers, busi
ness men and the general public
agree to-day that the situation i-,
exceedingly acute and strained,
and I am putting it mildly in say
ing that the prevailing peace
party has received a severe check
from the President's message,
which is looked upon in minis
terial circles as being derogatory
to Spanish dignity.
I went on 'Change and found
that even there the war fever was
raging. There was a fall of more
than 2 1-2 points in prominent
Government securities.
The council of Ministers was
held to-day, under the presidency
of the Queen Regent, and it was
decided to give the necessary in
structions to the legation at
Washington to be prepared to
leave if necessary. It was also
decided to call the Cortes in ex
traordinary session at once, and
this evening the Queen Regent
signed the decree convoking the
Parliament.
The preamble of the summons
for the convocation of the Cortes
will be published in to-morrow's
OrTiJal Gazette. It assumes a
very determined tone in justify
in;: the convocation. Senor S; 1 -
gasta, on leaving the palace, said
that Sen or Gullon, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs, would report
to the European powers the atti
The San Francisco Call
1 tude assumed by the United
States.
After the Cabinet council the
Ministers reassembled at the Min
istry for Foreign Affairs and there
! discussed the question of sending a
note to the great powers, com
municating the decisions arrived at
; during the day's Cabinet meeting.
One of the Ministers said the
Government "continues to main
tain the same firm attitude of de
fense, not defiance."
There is much comment upon
â¢ the extreme activity of the repre-
sentatives of the powers who have
been visiting Senor Gullon, and
there are many who look in this
direction for the ultimate solution
of the question.
General Weyler has arrived
here. He talks war and tries to
excite public feeling, but he does
not count. The Carlists, whose
power is more than a doubtful issue
now, declare that if Spain goes
to war they will unite with her;
if she does not they will wage an
internal war against her.
The anti-Government press is
rabid and the whole town is very
warlike. The Pais, in bi^ head

lines on its front page, announces:
"Infamy Disclosed at Last â
Shame on the Cuban Volunteers,"
and says: "As the Government
imposed silence upon us, we will
speak in the dumb language."
Accordingly, the first page of
the Pais contains hand signs read
ing: "Death to traitors."
In its leading article the Pais
asks whether the Government is
"preparing another farce by the
warlike attitude of the council last
night."
Continuing, the Pais charges
the Government with having ar
ranged the "armistice" with the
powers "prior to the United
States demanding it, the powers
promising in return the safety of
the throne, should the loss of Cuba
lead to a national uprising."
The Pais alsoexpresses the opin
ion that last night's bold attitude
of the Government was only a
"bluff" to deceive the people.
Later the Pais remarks: "The
message completes Spain's shame
and unless it is resented by the
Ministers the Americans, being
cowards, will bully in the propor
tion to which their opponent hu
miliates himself. But McKinley
is mistaken in thinking that he
knows Spain because he knows
her Ministers and the error will
cost him dear."
A dispatch from Havana to the
Pais says the Cuban volunteers
intend protesting against the armis
tice and accuses President McKin
ley of being in league with the
"separatist Junta," and adding,
"while facts have been discovered
against Lee in connection with the
Maine explosion which the Span
ish Government is afraid to pub
lish."
The Correo Espanol says: "Gen
eral Woodford ought to have re
ceived his passports on the receipt
of McKinley's message, but the
cowardly Government only dares
to use force against patriots crying
"Viva Espana."
The Liberal to-day says: "War
is inevitable, the last peaceful il
lusion disappearing before the'de
cision announced yesterday by the
Senate committee attributing to
Spain the Maine explosion, recog
nizing Cuban independence and
announcing that armed interven
tion will shortly take place."
Thereupon the! Liberal warns
Spain of the danger of delay and
â¢' further confidence in America,"
lest Spain "lose by a coup de
main, without a fight, honor which
she can well defend."
The Liberal then openly accuses
President McKinley of seeking an
nexation under the noses of the
powers in a manner similar to the
British occupation of Egypt.
Finally the Liberal says: "Dip
lomatic circles admit that Ameri
can bad faith puts Spain in a fav
orable position in the eyes of
Europe, but it is doubtful if the
powers will intervene, owing to
England's ambiguous attitude,"

, of Monday Night.
THE PRESIDENT
STRONGLY OPPOSED
TO RECOGNITION
Announces Definitely That He Will
Veto a Joint Resolution Com
ing to Him in That Form.
WASHINGTON, April 14.â
President McKinley told Sen
ators Hale and Allison to-day,
in emphatic language, that if
Congress passed a joint reso
lution recognizing the inde
pendence of the Cuban re
public he would veto it; and
if it passed a concurrent res
olution to the same effect he
would simply ignore it.
NEW YORK. April 14.â The Her-
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: With politics entering into
the Cuban situation in Con
gress, with a sudden call in
Spain for a special session of the Cortes,
and another effort being made by the
powers in the direction of mediation,
the Hispano-American question is still
in an aggravated and somewhat uncer
tain state.
There is no peace in sight any
where, but there are signs of a few
more days' delay before the American
Congress takes the final war plunge.
All indications to-night point to ac
tion of some kind by the Senate before
the final adjournment is reached to
morrow. The advocate^ of the recogni
tion of the independence of the republic
of Cuba, coupled with forcible interven
tion, made great progress to-day. In
fact it developed to-day that a. majority
of the Senate is in favor of recognizing
the independence of Cuba. Whether
this majority will exist when the final
vote is taken to-morrow cannot be defi
nitely foreshadowed, as the situation is
changing every hour.
The visit of Mr. Bry?.n. former Dem
ocratic nominee for President, to the
Capitol to-day was not without its poli
tical significance in connection with the
situation. Mr. Bryan is not only an ad
vocate of the recognition of indepen
dence from personal convictions, but
also because he believes that it is the
proper political step to take. He was in
conference with leading Democratic
Senators to-day, urging them to present
a solid front in favor of recognition,
holding that two points would thereby
be gained.
It it is defeated the Democrats wil!
have gone on record in favor of recog
nition, which is believed to be a popu
lar step; and, if it is not done, the
Democrats will get the credit of the ac
tion. Besides, the President will either
NOT SOLD TO SPAIN.
ROME, Ap:.l 14.â The Messa

tions for the Â£ale of the Italian
cruiser Garibaldi to Spain have

ers about to become belligerents.
have to veto the proposition or accept
it in the face of his argument in his mes
sage.
However this may be, there is no
doubt thnt many Democratic Senators
believe their position in favor of recog
nition puts them in excellent shape be
fore the country, while Senator Allen of
Nebraska said yesterday that if the Re
publicans don't recognize the indepen
dence of Cuba there would not be a
handful of Republican voters next
fall.
The desire to make political capital
out of the Republican embarrassment
was also shown in the Senate this even
ing, when Senator Allen said that if the
Senate were to be allowed to adjourn
the country should know that it was fa
vored and accomplished by Republican
votes.
In the event of the Senate passing
the Foraker or any other resolutions
embodying a provision recognizing
the independence of Cuba, there is
every likelihood that such a measure
would prevail in the House, where
the sentiment in favor of indepen
dence is quite as strong as in the
Senate.
From the way the President talked to
some of his Congressional callers to
day the indications are that he would
veto such a resolution if it were pre
sented to him. Indeed, he would be con
strained to do so to be consistent with
the strong position which he has pub
licly taken against recognizing the gov
ernment, which, he declares, does not
cxi?t.
With Congress and the President thus
divided, the Cuban question would be as
far off from settlement as ever, while
the political complications would be of
the most serious character.
All the Bepublican leaders are
laboring hard to-night to keep the
party in line against the independ
ence feature.
Some of the shrewdest men of the
party admit that the vote, when taken,
will leave a very narrow rrargin for the
resolution of the Committee on Foreign
SPAIN PREPARES
TO DESTROY THE
FLYING SQUADRON
That Is Believed to Be the Purpose
in Massing the Torpedo Fleet
at Cape Verde Islands.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
ST. VINCENTS, Cape Verde Islands, April 14. â Three more war
ships of the Spanish navy, including the cruisers Cristobal Colon and
the Infanta Maria Teresa, arrived this morning, accompanied by the sec
ond torpedo flotilla which recently left Spain. This flotilla is composed of
torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers.
The boats of the first torpedo flotilla, which has been in port for
some time, have been painted with black lead by order of the com
mander, Senor Villami.
The ships are keeping ready for sea, and forty tons of coal were
placed on board the transport and smaller boats.
The Spanish authorities are trying to secure enough coal to coal
the second flotilla and convoys. They are trying to engage several
hundred tons to be delivered immediately.
NEW YORK, April 14. â A Washington special dispatch to
the Herald says: More formidable than the first Spanish
torpedo flotilla is the second. It is composed of three
torpedo boat destroyers â the Destructor, of 386 tons displacement;
the Osada and Proserpina, each of 400 tons, and the torpedo boats
Halcon of 108 tons, Orion of eighty-five tons, Retamosa of seventy
tons, Barcelo of sixty-six tons, and Habana of fifty-nine tons. The
destroyers are of modern English construction. The torpedo boats
have been in service for the last twelve years, but they are still in,
good condition.
It is expected that the Audaz, a sister ship of the Osada, will leave
Queenstown when her repairs are finished, for the Cape Verde Islands
via Spain, and her presence will add materially to the strength of thia
flotilla.
Keports received by the Navy Department indicate that the con
verted yacht Giralde may have accompanied the second torpedo boat
flotilla as a supply ship, just as the Ciudad de Cadiz sailed with the
first torpedo boat flotilla. It is believed in naval circles that the ships
now at the Cape Verde Islands will wait for the Vizcaya and Oquendo
before proceeding to any other point.
It was suggested to-day that the mobilization of such a strong
force at the Cape Verde Islands was due to Spain's desire to form a
squadron sufficiently strong to overpower the flying squadron of the
American navy, which the Madrid Government appreciates is intended
for service on her side of the Atlantic.
It is something of a puzzle to the officials, the ability of Spain
to secure funds with which to purchase ships, but it is supposed that
her cash has been obtained from the rich men of the country, who ara
reported to have liberally contributed money for the purpose of strength
ening the Spanish navy.
Mr. Woodford informed the State Department that Spain had ne
gotiated no new loans, but it is expected that one will be authorized
immediately after the meeting of the Cortes next week.
Relations. Considerable interest is man
ifested as to the manner in which simi
lar action by both houses can be se
cured. The solution of the problem is
very easy. When the proper time ar
rives in the Senate Mr. Davis will have
to move to strike out all after the enact
ing clause of the House resolution and
amend by inserting the Senate declara
tion. This having been done, the reso
lution will be sent back to the House in
its amended form, and the question in
the latter body will then be whether it

will concur or non-concur in the amend
ment.
If the House decides to end the matt*
quickly and Speaker Reed will allow |
motion to be made, the motion to coa
cur in the Senate amendr-ent could h
offered and adopted, after which the*
would be no further ;.ction necessau
before the resolution went to the Presi
dent.
This would avoid the delay of confej
ence, a delay which the conservative
would gladly welcome2

PREPARING TO
RETURN HOME
The SpaQish Minister Stops At
tending Social functions and
Awaits Recall to Madrid.
WASHINGTON, April 14.â The Spanish Minister, Senor Pol" de
c, has mad-: linal preparations for his departure from Wash
ington, but no actual step in that direction will be taken until spe
c iii. instructions are received from Madrid. Up to the present time
there have been no such instructions and no intimations that they
were about to come, but the preparations for removal have been com-
In view of the condition of affairs.
The official archives, which constitute the most important posses
sion of the Spanish legation, have been sealed in readiness to be placed
in charge of the French Embassador at Washington, M. Cambon. They
(ill a dozen or more large cases, each protected by a heavy wire
screened door. The transfer of these documents has not been ordered
from Madrid, nor has the foreign office at Paris instructed M. Cambon
ive the archives and act temporarily in behalf of the Spanish
Government. At the same time a call by the French Embassador to
the Spanish legation, and a return call by Senor Polo de Eernabe to
the French Embassy, brought about an understanding as to what steps
would be taken in the event of the retirement of the Minister.
Until to-day the Spanish Minister has continued to accept the so
cial courtesies extended to him, these being numerous and including
the hospitality of Cabinet officers and others high in the Government
service. In view, however, of the reports of the Foreign Committee In
Congress and of the grave trend of affairs, he has decided not to ac
cept further courtesies of this character, as it necessarily involves his
coining into close personal relations with public men who may have
participated in the severe, and, in his judgment, unwarranted denuncia
tion of Spain in official reports.
It is the feeling in diplomatic circles that under ordinary circum
stances the action in Congress â the report of the two Foreign commit
tees, the passage ol resolutions by the House, and the character of the
debate â would make it incumbent on Spanish Minister to leave
without further waiting eventualities, which are now regarded as un
avoidable. But against this it is known that the Spanish Government
will not either by the withdrawal of the Minister or by any other con
spicuous step, place itself In a position of having invited a recourse
to war. On the contrary, the entire policy at Madrid, It is stated,
is to remain passive until the United States not only makes the ten
der of war, but executes it by unmistakable overt acts. It has fur
ther been developed as the unmistakable policy of Spain that she will
resist armed intervention In Cuba as an attack upon her sovereignty.
The House resolutions now He upon
the table in the Senate awaiting the dis
tion outlined. There is no likeli
hood of their adoption by the Senate.
They will be supported by comparatively
few votes.
Whether the House will accept the
Senate resolutions in the manner de
scribed is a question not definitely
settled, but there was nsiderable dis
cussion among members to-day and a
willingness expressed to accept the
Senate resolution.
The Senate adjourned soon after 6
o'clock this evening to attend Senator
MorriU's birthday party. The resolu
tions declaring for intervention in Cuba
upon which the momentous issue of war
depends were left hanging in the air.
No agreement of any kind as to the
time for taking a vote was reached. No
tice was given by Senator Davis, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, that the session which begins at
io o'clock to-morrow shall be con
tinuous until a vote is taken.
Under ordinary circumstances it
would be easy to predict that a vote will
be reached at a late hour to-morrow
night, and even now there is a stron^
hi'ity that this may be the result.
At the same time it must not be
forgotten that half a dozen Senators
are determined to delay final action
.to the last moment, and Senator
Wellington of Maryland, whose pro-
Spanish views are extreme, loudly,
and even frantically, exclaimed in
the Senate just before adjournment
to-night that no vote should be taken
at any time with his consent.
It is probable that when the list of
speakers, which is quite long, has been
exhausted, the vote will be taken, and
that no Senator will undertake the re
sponsibility of beginning filibustering
tactics. There are now more than
twenty Senators scheduled for speeches.
Including Senators Cullom, Daniel.
Frye, Tillman, Wolcott, Spoor.er, Chil
ton, Platt of Connecticut, Cannon, Pet
tigrew, Proctor. Burrows. Bacon. Wel
lington, Stewart, CafTery, Hawley,
White and Rawlins.
. Some of the Senators, however, will
be content with ten minutes' talk,
merely for the purpose of defining their
position, and fully half of them will
forego the pleasure of hearing their
voices, if by this self-denial the vote can
be sooner reached.
At a late hour to-morrow night,
therefore, if the present tacit under
standing be not disarranged, the vote
will be taken. If it is delayed it will
be because the statement from Spain
that the Cortes have been summoned to
meet in extra session next Wednesday
offers to the conservatives another hope
of possible action on the part of Spain
in the direction of further propositions.
Rumors were current to-day of nego
tiations between Gomez and the Span
ish Government for the purchase of the
island, and the conservatives are unani
mously of the opinion that if the Cubans
and the Spanish can come to an agree
ment the administration will be able to
settle the Maine matter on the basis of
arbitration, as suggested by Spain, and
thus all cause of friction will be re
moved. There is no doubt that every
effort will be made by the conservatives
to-morrow to prevent a vote. They suc
ceeded to-day in preventing an agree
ment, and they may be equally success
ful to-morrow.
When the vote is finally taken,
however, it will result in the adop
tion of the Senate resolutions un
changed. This is the present out
look.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April 14â The feeling here of
both the press and the public is very
strong against the United States; es
pecially since President McKinley's
message. Mr. McKinley is compared
to I'ontius Pilate and the American
Congress is accused of a buecaneenn:.:
spirit which it is feared will extend to
the possessions r>t other nations as well
as those of Spain.
There is feverish activity at the Gov- j
eminent dockyards in completing yes- |
sels and rearming old ones.
Frenchmen are quite indignant at
the suggestion that the United States j
will possibly decline orivateering. and I
the powers in consequence may force !
Spain also to renounce the privilege. II j
is believed that the Government will, \
however, preserve a strict neutrality. I
American residents in Paris are in- j
tensely excited. The idea of war is not j
very popular among them, but the bet
ting is very brisk at all the American
resorts. Mr. Henry Vignaud, secretary !
of the United States Embassy, in the |
course of an interview, is reported as ;
saying that he considers war inevita
ble, although America desires peace !
and does not desire to annex Cuba. !
The hour has struck, he believes, for
.the severance of Cuba from Spain.
"France has no need to appear shock
ed," said Mr. Vignaud, '"at the sup
posed motives of the United States.
They are the same that prompted her
to assist the American colonies in the \
war of Independence, yet the position
of America as a British colony was
far superior to that of downtrodden
Cuba."

DID JAPAN *RM THE
PHILIPPINE INSURGENTS.
Facts Connected With the Last Up
rising Puzzle the Spanish
Authorities.
MADRID (via Bayonne), April 14.â A |
letter just received here from the Phil- |
ippine Islands says that all the troops j
which wore embarking for Spain at ''
the time the communication was mailed
were marched hurriedly to various |
towns in the interior, where the re- !
belllon against Spanish rule has been j
renewed. It is added that over 2000
well-armed men are now in the field.
There have been several engagements
and a number of Spanish priests have
been massacred. Nobody -appears to
know how the Philippine insurgents,
who had been disarmed, according to
general report, were rearmed, but the
belief prevails that Japan had a hand
in the matter.
The captain-general of the Philippine i
Islands, it is further alleged, has been
concealing the facts in the case from
the Government.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FKIDAY, APRIL 15, 1898.
NOT PRETTY,
BUT HUMAN
English Comment on the
Scene in the House
on Wednesday.
On the Whole John Bull Ap
proves of the United
States.
Does Not Like tha American Method
of Making a Declaration
of War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 14.â The afternoon
papers to-day print long comments on
"the evil of leaving the issue of peace
or war in the hands of Congress." Not
one of the papers, however, questions j
the duty of the United States to inter- |
vene in Cuba, but tht-y are disposed to |
criticize the methods proposed.
The Westminster Gazette says: "The â 
scene in the House and the Senate's in- j
suiting report in regardito the Maine |
are hardly edifying, but they are the [
inevitable result of the peculiar pro- \
visions of the constitution which dis
arms the executive and compel the last
steps in a most perilous crisis to be
taken In blazing publicity. It is im
possible not to sympathize with the in
dignation of the Americans and the !
solemn lectures which some of the |
British newspapers are administering j
to America are ridiculous. Still, there ;
is a feeling that the two countries are
marching to an unavoidable calamity." |
The Pall Mall Gazette expresses the I
opinion that the resolutions of the >
House of Representatives were "the
logical and practical corollary of the
message," adding: "The scene in the !
House was not pretty, but it was quite j
human. On the eve of war it is natural i
that people should be excited."
.Referring to the comments of the
Times on the situation the Pall Mall |
Gazette says: "The committee was ]
not meaning peace, nor is President I
McKinley. He has done all he could to ]
that end and in a way which should !
Becure his fame, but ho knows where j
statesmanlike moderation and tact be- ;
come weakness."
The other afternoon papers have but
little patience with the sermon of the i
Times. They freely acknowledge that j
the Americans have shown "extreme I
patience under the most terrible provo
cation," eulogize the crusad* against |
Spanish cruelty and refer to the news
papers which criticize the United States j
a-s being the same "who supported the
Turks against Armenia and the slave
owners against the slaves."
The morning papers are filled with
dispatches frf>m the continent, nearly '
all of the same tenor. The belief that
war is Inevitable is universal as well
as the feeling of hostility to the United
States. The papers also contain numer
ous articles speculating upon the effect '
of war upon securities, the markets
and other Interests.
The Times says editorially: "Spain's j
note to the powers can have no effort ''â 
excepj perhaps to delay the issue. The
powers will certainly not intervene, j
while if they did neither the United j
States nor Spain would listen. It is
doubtful whether, even If President
McKinley regained his authority over
the situation, he could stem the j
tide of popular sentiment in America
for war."
The Daily rhronicl<\ from what it
calls a well-known correspondent sign
ing himself "Anglo-Saxon." prints a
remarkable letter advocating an An- j
glo-American alliance to compel the
liberation of Cuba without war by an I
overwhelming display of force.
Commenting on this letter the Daily
Chronicle thinks it "an opportune mo
ment to seek to bring about such an
alliance or entente, especially in view
of the common interests of the United j
States and Great Britain in China."
The Morning Post advises Spain to
act promptly, "as every day's delay in
creases the probability that the force
against her will be stronger than it is I
ri"\w" Commenting upon the disturb
ance of the balance of power from
America's annexation of r*uba, the

! â â  gret the policy of isolation England

The Daily Graphic, referring to
Senator Hoar's statement that Presi
dent McKinley still believes in the pos
sibility of peace, says: "The United

The Daily News, commenting upon a

SAGASTA SAYS

Madrid Government Absolutely Re

LONDON, April 15.â The Madrid cor-

graphing at 5 o'clock Thursday after
noon, says:
"I have Just had a conversation with
Senor Sagasta, who assured me that
the Government was absolutely re
solved not to provoke hostilities with
America. He added: 'I should be ex
tremely sorry were the country to lose
its present self-possession because of
the incessant menaces addressed to us
by the United States. We are striving
with all our might to repress the na
tional excitement. While others are
! carrying on agitation with as much

I any cause of offense to the Ufflted

. all possible energy to defend the honor
and interests of Spain.' "

Negotiating for Torpedo Catchers
BERLIN, April 15.â According to ad
vices from Kiel the United States is
negotiating for the purchase of the tor
pedo-catchers Timburi and Tupy, now
j being built at the German yards for
Brazil, which offers more ships for
sale. Holland also is inclined to sell
two armored cruisers. The Timburi
and Tupy are among the fastest vessels
in the world, capable of twenty-three
kno:ts an hour.
It is said here that all the American
officers on furlough in Europe have
been ordered home forthwith. Owing
to the millions of Germans in America
the excitement in Berlin is intense.
Nearly all the papers refer in strong
language to President McKinley's mes
sage and the public is strongly against
the United States.
THE POWERS
INDIFFERENT
France and Austria Want
to Move to Save the
Spanish.
Doubtful Whether Germany
and Russia Will Join in
the Action.
Unless All of Them Unite in the
Step the Effort Will Be
Wasted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Itiggs House,
Washington, April 14.
It was learned to-night in high diplo
matic quarters that an exchange of
notes had been begun between the Eu
ropean capitals with a view of making
strong representations on the Spanish-
American situation. In the same con
nection, an informal meeting of the i
Embassadors and Ministers in the city
of the six great powers of Europe was
held late in the day. Several of the
foreign establishments received cable
advices from their Governments to
night as to the opening of the exchange
of notes. This had been anticipated,
in view of the prevailing sentiment in
all the foreign quarters here that the
action thus far taken in Congress made
war inevitable. This common opinion
had been officially reported to the seve
ral European capitals and it was doubt
less instrumental in starting the active
exchange between the great powers to
day. The same exchange occurred a
week ago as a preliminary to the Joint
note of the great powers presented to
President McKinley, mildly urging a
peaceful settlement with Spain. It is
understood, however, that the present
movement is not of the .same mild char
acter as the former one.
Simultaneous with the opening of the
exchange, word came from Madrid that
the Spanish Government was about to
issue another appeal to the great pow
ers of Europe. It is understood that
this appeal is an initiatory to the con
certed action of the powers, and there
is an apparent agreement in advance
that the appeal will receive favorable
consideration.
It is said that the Spanish appeal will
recite her grievances against the United
States, stating In detail the many con
cessions she has made, and pointing
out that it was in response to the urg
ent representation of the powers that
the last concession of an armistice was
granted.
If the powers determine to act their
influence will be particularly directed
toward inducing the United States to j
grant Spain sufficient time within
which to try the armistice recently pro- j
claimed.
During the recent joint action of the
powers their main influence was ex
erted at Madrid, the only action at |
Washington being the courteous ex- j
pression of hope for peace, but the
present movement contemplates that
the influence shall be exerted at Wash
ington rather than at Madrid, and it is
the common Relief in diplomatic quar
ters that the' Madrid authorities have
reached the limit of concessions, and
should now be given adequate time to
try what they and the powers have
offered as a means of restoring peace 'â¢
in Cuba. There is no suggestion, how
ihat this influence at present will
!>â  of material character, but it is ex
pected to be an assertion of all the i
m iral influence Of the powers in check-
Ing tendencies which, it is believed, in- j
evitably will lead to war. Up to a late
hour to-night word had not been re
ceived at the various foreign establish
ments that any common basis of joint
action had been reached, although it
was the general impression that there
would be little difficulty in arriving at
this common ground, in view at the
prevailing sentiment abroad. It is not
so certain, however, that all of the
powers are ready for the step of this
character. Germany has of late shown
a disposition to avoid exerting strong
influences on the United States. Rus
sia is also thought to be somewhat in
different. France and Austria are most
active in the present movement, as
they were in the former one. Whether
all six great powers are ready to join
in the movement is in doubt, and
without this united action it is felt
that the force of such influence would
be lost.
THESE ARE STRICTLY
WAR MEASURES.
â
Care of Coast Defenses Provided For,
and a Bill for Four Hundred
Thousand Volunteers.
NEW FORK, April 14.â A Washing- j
ton special to the Herald says: Gen
eral orders were issued to-day by Sec
retary Alger to place the care of coast <
defenses and the direction of all unfln- j
ished work at fortifications within !
their respective departments, under the <
direction and command of Major-Gen- j
era! Wesley Merritt, commanding the '
Department of the East; Brigadier- ]
General William R. Shafter, command- j
ing the Department of California, and
Brigadier-General William M. Graham, ;
commanding the Department of the i
Gulf.
This is directly a war measure. Ac- ,
companying the orders to general offi
cers explicit instructions were sent for ;
work to be hastened at all points as
rapidly as possible.
It i& stated upon high authority at
I the War Department that orders to ;
! concentrate troops and National ;
i Guards, previously designated in the
Herald, probably will be Issued before
the end of the week. It was also said
at the department that it is probable
that not less than 100,000 men will com
j prise the first call for troops. In order
I to empower the President to enlist vol
j unteers for service for outside the
I United States, Representative Handy
i of Delaware is expected to introduce in
i the House to-morrow a bill authorizing
I the acceptance of 400,000 volunteers.
This does not mean that 400,000 volun
teers are to immediately be called for,
but fixes that number as the limit
which may be called into service upon
emergency.
China Declines to Sell.
LONDON, April 15.â The Shanghai

I has declined to sell to the United States
three cruisers that are being built for
her in Germany, although the Ameri

LONDON, April 15.â A dispatch to

Why the Guoboat Marietta Was So
Well Protected by the Valpa

Copyrighted, 1808, by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Chile, April 14â1 am Informed on authority which
cannot be disputed, but which I am not at liberty to give, that there
was a plot to injure the United States gunboat Marietta while she
was In this port. Just prior to the arrival of the Marietta the
United States consulat; In Valparaiso was informec by trustworthy
persons that an attempt against the gunboat was contemplated by
Spanish subjects in Chile.
Immediately upon receipt of this information United States Minis
ter Henry L. Wilson, Consul John F. Caples and Vice-Consul August
Moller Jr. called upon the Governor of the province and laid the matter
before him. This explains the unexpected trip of the United States
Minister from Santiago to Valparaiso. Once acquainted with the fears
of the American representatives and the facts in the case the Gover
nor immediately gave assurance that the city and maritime authorities
would take precautions to protect the Marietta and extended the Min
ister a cordial welcome to officers and seamen. During the stay of the
Marietta no greater vigilance could have been exercised by the Chil
ean authorities had the safety of one of her own warships been de
pendent upon them. Before the gunboat sailed the American Minister,
the Consul and Vice-Consul, accompanied by Captain Svmonds of the
Marietta, called upon the Governor, and on behalf of the United States
Government thanked the Chilean authorities for what had been done
to protect the warship.
THE PLANS TO
INVADE CUBA
Two American Armies
Will Be Landed on
the Island.
One in the West Will at Once
Lay Siege to the City of
Havana.
The Other in the East Will Join the
Insurgents in the
Field.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, April 14.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Lieu
tenant Colonel A. L. Wagner, chief of
the military information division of the
War Department and member of the
army and navy defense board, was in
consultation for several hours to-day
with the naval war board regarding
plans for intervention In Cuba- Com
prehensive plans for the co-operation
of the army and navy were exhaustive
ly discussed at this conference. The
first step of the administration in car
rying out the wishes of Congress when
they have been expressed by the pas
sage of the resolutions empowering in
tervention of the President to end the
war in C'uha, will be to make a formal
deiiiand upon Spain to withdraw her
forces from Cuba, and leave the in
surgents in undisputed possession of
the island. A copy of the resolution
will accompany these demands.
It is understood that active work of
the army in Cuba, as at present
planned by the joint board of the army
and navy, contemplates sending troops
to Cuba in two grand divisions. One
of these divisions will land in the neigh
borhood of Havana on the side of the
city where the defenses are weakest,
and there will entrench and lay siege
to the city in conjunction with the
naval blockade to be maintained out
side of the harbor.
The other division of the army, it is
understood, will operate in the eastern
end of the island, supporting the insur
gents and supplying them with all ne
cessary arms.
While a few days may be given to
Spain in which to reply to the Presi
dent's demand, orders to concentrate
the available troops of the regular
army in the South, to mobilize the Na
tional Guard and to direct the naval
forces to be in readiness to execute the
campaign plans which have been pre
pared will be issued in advance of her
reply, which, it is believed by the au
thorities, will be made by her warships
rather than by her diplomats.
The insurgents, on account of their
acquaintance with the topography and
existing conditions in the island, will
be relied upon in great measure to di
rect the details and scope of the mili
tary operations. Supported by United
States troops they will advance toward
Havana from the east in an effort to
drive the Spanish army toward that
city. The plan is to ultimately con
solidate the two divisions of the army
around Havana and thus reduce the
city by siege upon all sides. The re
duction of Matanzas forms a part of
the department plans.
The navy will take the initiative in
j the administration plans of interven
tion. The Key West fleet, under Com*
| modore Sampson, will at once sail for
i Havana, and the flying squadron, un
j der Commodore Schley, will make a
dash for Porto Rico. If active inter
j vention is to be made as quickly as thÂ«
i situation now indicates is probable, the
I Spanish naval forces will not have
time to arrive in the Gulf of Mexico to
! render material assistance in defense of
I the Spanish possessions.
WILL BUY AND NOT
CHARTER THE VESSELS.
The Government About Decided to
Purchase the St. Louis and St.
Puul and Man Them.
NEW YORK, April 14.â A Washing
ton special 6Â« the Herald says: Sec
retary Long will finally determine to
morrow either to charter the American
line steamers St. Louis, St. Paul, Paris
and New York, or to purchase out
right the St. Louis and St. Paul. There
is reason to believe that the charter
proposition has been discussed with
President Griscom of the American line
who was at the Navy Department to
day, but from indications it looks as
though the Government will buy the
St. Louis and St. Paul. There is a
possibility that the department may
determine to direct the formation of a
board of appraisers to purchase the St.
Louis and St. Paul in case there should
be any disagreement as to the price to
be paid for them by the Government.
It has been determined by the Navy
Department to use the Naval Militia
on board merchant ships, but it can be
stated authoritatively that such organ
izations will be impressed into service
as battalions, that is, they will not be
separated and distributed among sev
eral vessels.

Enthusiasm.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., April 14.â
The Twenty-fifth Infantry arrived here
this afternoon and, with the exception
of two companies, which left for Key !
West in the early part of the even- !
ing, it is quartered in the cars until to- j
morrow morning, when they will go
into camp at Chickamauga Park.
The detachment which left for Key
West will reach there some time to
morrow night.
The nearer to Key West the regiment
gets the more full of fight do the sol
diers become. A restaurant man said
to a group of them: "I don't see what !
they are sending you fellows to Cuba j
for; you can't fight," whereupon he i
was promptly knocked down and out.
The warm reception given the regi
ment late yesterday afternoon was re
peated at Nashville this morning, and
at every place along the line, especially
by the colored people. Fully 2000 peo
ple were crowded into the depot at
Chattanooga to welcome them and
cheer after cheer was given.
NASHVILLE, Term., April 14.â 1f
any doubt existed regarding the pat
riotism and warlike feeling of the resi
dents of Illinois, Indiana and Tennes
see, along the Chicago and Eastern Illi
nois Railroad, it would have been swept
away by the reception given the
Twenty-fifth Infantry as it passed
along. At every town, on every street
crossing and on the depot platforms
men waved their arms in frantic token
of approval and in most instances sec
onded their gestures by yells. In the
larger towns, where the train stopped
for a few moments, the crowd piled so
closely in upon the cars that it was im
possible for the soldiers to leave the
train at all.
"I was among those who answered
the first call in 1861," said the com
manding officer. Colonel Andrew Burt,
to-day, "and these scenes along the
way are very similar to those that
greeted us as we went to the front
thirty-seven years ago."
At one small station where the train
stopped for water the Colonel said to
the men on the platform:
"Are you going to follow us, boys, if
war comes?"
"We are coming right after you,"
shouted several, and Colonel Burt
climbed back into the train with the
remark:
"I guess those follows are all right."
The men of the Twenty-fifth are full
of fight and it was shown in good style
last night as the train left Terra Haute.
A youn- fellow on the platform shouted
in joke: "Hurrah for Spain!" and in
stantly there was a break by several
soldiers to reach him. They were held
back by the non-commissioned officers,
who explained that it was r.eant as a
joke.
"That don't matter," was the reply
"Let nobody tell us 'Hurrah for
Spain!' "
NAVAL NEWS IS

While Uncle Sam Is Buying and
Arming Vessels Their Movements

WASHINGTON, April 14.â The most
pronounced development In the Navy
Department to-dry was the issuance of
an order prohibiting the giving out of
movements of vessels. Since the be
ginning of the present crisis the de
partment has been gradually closing in
th ? lines of information and to-day the
official order went out that the custom
of posting ship movements should j
cease. . It was explained that in view ;
of existing conditions this was deemed
necessary, and hereafter no movements
whatever will be made public.
One more auxiliary cruiser was pur- i
chased to-day, the steamer Venezuela '
of the Red Line. She will immediately
be sent to shipyard for refitting. Secre- â¢
tary Long stated at the close of office |
hours to-day that the steamship Paris !
and the New York had not yet passed j
into the posses' ion of the department.
It is understood, however, that as soon
as the question of terms can be set
tled these yes >ls will he placed on the
naval list along with the St. Louis and
St. Paul, of the same line. It is also
stated that negotiations are under way
for the purchase of the Holland sub
marine torpedo boat Plunger. The de
partment is now awaiting the report of
the board which was ordered to in
spect this novel craft.

yesterday by the Senate Committee on

the day was an attempt to fix a vote
and the failure to do so on account of
the d<sire of many Senators to debate

It is impossible now to sny when a vote

All day long conference? of Senators

By unanimous consent, at the request
of Davis, chairman of the Foreign Rela

reported by the Foreign Relations Com
mittee was laid before the Senate.
Turner of Washington began a speech
in which lie sharply criticised the admin
istration for the "vacillating and irreso
lute, cowardly and pusillanimous policy"
pursued by it in the Cuban question. He
eaid that the developments of the past
two weeks had shaken his faith in those
who held the President's ear and confi
dence. Turner declared himself strongly
in favor of the resolution presented by
the minority, of the Committee on For
eign la; ions, and for so doing he need
le" 0 further justification than the mag-
TJliicent state paper which accompanied
the majority report. He declared, how
ever, that the same malevolent influ
ences which had paralyzed the executive
and almost caused the people to revolt
were still at work. If these influences

and unavailing. At the Spanish end of

man whose desire for peace was so
etrong that he refused to obey the plain

that, with such diplomatic agents repre

for Cuban independence, and it should be |
wielded by an arm stronger than ever.
Once uplifted, it should never be lowered
until Spain was driven from the western
hemisphere. He read several telegrams j
from prominent citizens of Washington '
to show the drift of the sentiment in that
State. One from the Governor declared i
that intervention without recognition of j
independence would be utterly unsatis
factory. Another from the colonel of the

as it had been made under the impression
that they would be called upon to light
Spaniards, not Cubans.
when the venerable Senator from Mas
sachusetts, Hoar, arose to follow Turner,
there was a visible stir in the audience.
The Senator from Massachusetts said
that be wanted to make a few observa
tions <iuietly. calmly and in the manner
of a court "dealing with the great prob
lems of public welfare and public honor.
He thought it was not th* time for im
passioned rhetoric, loud declamation, the
clapping of hands and the stamping of
feet, but rather it was thp position of ab
solute deliberation that should command
such a scone and such an occasion. H<"
argued that the report of cruelty
and oppression in the island of Cuba un
doubtedly warranted some measures
which would bring peace, but he doubted
the wisdom of rushing headlong into war !
until every other diplomatic effort had
been made to bring about an honorable I
cessation of hostility
Then, with a voice trembling with emo
tion, his head slowly shaking as the j
words came forth, he told how a captain
of a company of Infantry organized In j
the same town in which he was born !
went forth in the morning of the revolu- !
tion to hold the bridge at Concord, and I
siid that he was in the same position
as that oant.iin was. Realizing the tre- i
mendous responsibilities of his high office, i
.light that whatever was done,
should be done with an eye single to the
situation. Then, with hand raised and
amidst profound stillness in the Senate |
chamber he made this significant remark:
"If this country is to do a great act of
international justice, let us do It calmly
and deliberately."
Senator Hoar argued that the attacks
upon the President wore ill advised and !
most ill timed; that instead of condemna
tion of the policy of the executive, the
country and Congress should commend
the President In nis efforts making for
peace, so long as peace could be had with
honor. Thin, after presenting a tribute
to thp President, the Senator said that
the men who suffered by modern wars
were not the men who provoked them, |
and that the men who reaped the benefits !
from wars were a few officers and the I
stock Jobbers. He said that war meant j
th* addition of untold millions to the pub
lic debt of the country, the puing up of
pensions mountain high and would bring
woe and desolation to thousands .of
homes.
"I like and thank the President of the
United Ftates for hi.s sublime self-re
straint in this emergency and for holding
back so far as he could the step toward
war." Hoar said that the name of Mc-
Kinley would be linked with other ac
tions of notable self-restraint which had
characterized the American people in
other momentous hours. "Have we for
gotten." said he, "that the same kind of
objurgation and contumely was hurled at
the head of Washington when he held
back the people from another war with
England?"
'I am old enough," said Hoar, "to re
member some of these tempests of popu
lar excitement in Congress and out of it.
Some of the Senators h'-re remember the
cry of "On to Richmond! On to Rich
mond! and the charges of impotence and
cowardice which were heaped on Abra
ham Lincoln. Some of us on this side
of the chamber wish that we might for
get Bull Run."
He then rapidly reviewed a great many
international cases, with quotations from
national law, to show that the present
government of Cuba would be inimical to
the best interests of the United States
and -would not have the 6upport of civil
ized nations.
"To recognize the insurgents," said
Hoar, "would be to ignore our whole his
tory, and we cannot recognize that inde
pendence without flying in the face of the
wholÂ« history of the world. We need the
sympathy of the civilized world in the
struggle which seems so near to us, and
we can only keep it by recognizing the
law of nations."
He said that he did not belong to the
school of lawyers who believed that if the
United States took Spain by the neck and
heels and threw her out of the island of
Cuba it would make the United States
responsible for any bonds which Spain
might have agreed to pay from revenues
derived from the island.
Hoar said the Cuban insurgents had a
great title to the sympathies of this coun
try. They were struggling for freedom,
they were brave and resolute. The as
piration of Gomez seemed to be toward
the establishment of a black republic in
the West Indies. "And," said Hoar, "I
honor and bless him ior that aspiration."
The insurgents, however, hedid not think
were without fault. Long before Spain
had put into effet . the reconcentrado or
der they had applied the torch and other
wise destroyed everything that stood in
their way. from crops to towns. Hoar
said, however, that the fact that both

parties to the wrr In Cuba were respon
sible for the existing horrors did not In
any way detract from our own responsi
bility. He thoughi it the righ f and duty
of the American people to deal with the
difficulties.
"We should not," he said, "begin by
quarreling among oursejvea and slapping
in the face the President of the United
States; nor shouhl we endeavor In the
discussion of this matter to make party
capital."
He pronounced the report of the For
eign Relations Committee a masterly
document, and paid its author (Davis)
a high compliment for the ability ex
hibited in its preparation. He agreed
with the conclusions of the report that
th<^ United States was warranted entirely
by international law in putting an end to
the horrors that existed at our very
doors. He agreed, further, he said, with
the President of the United States, who
had declared that it was impossible for
Spain to maintain a proper and stable
government upon the island. The con
tinuance of the Spanish flag over Cuba
could not longer be tolerated. He held,
therefore, that we must directly and as
soon as possible expel Spain from the
Island. Spain cannot prevent the dis
turbances of the peace and prosperity of
the island. We can and we must. He
liked, however, a resolution which had
been drawn up by Teller of Colorado, and
maintained that In that resolution the
United States was authorized to go as
far as it ought.
Hoar declared his belief that the de
struction of the Maine was a meditated
act, for which Spanish officers were
probably responsible. "With that view,"
said Hoar, "the Spanish Government is
responsible for that loss, and it ought to
be held responsible by the United States."
The resolution to be passed, he said
would lead to war, and war such as the
world has not seen for many years; a war
of no foreign conquest, for no national
gain or personal aggrandizement, but a
war for humanity. Speaking of the de
struction of the Maine, he said that It
was a wretched act on the part of Spain,
which demanded full reparation. In
closing, Hoar said:
"If ther hayÂ« b*Â«n any hasty

HERE IS A STORY THAT
IS ABSURD ON ITS FACE.
NEW YORK, April 14.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: "It is the wish of the administration," said one promi
nent member of the administration to me to-day, "and it is believed
to be the desire of the Spanish Government, that this entire Cuban
matter, including the destruction of the Maine, should be settled with
a show of hostilities to satisfy the people of both nations, but, as a
matter of fact, peacefully and in strict accordance with the law of
the nations. If the United States sends her warships to Havana and
takes charge of the Custom-house, this will satisfy Americans that
their honor is safe. If tl European powers then intervene, as they
have done in similar cases, and call upon Spain and the United
States to submit their differences to a court of arbitration, the Span
ish people will be satisfied, because Spain refused to accede to the
demands of the United States and was prevented from war by the
allied po-wers. Spain will rid herself of the troublesome Cuban pro
blem with honor and dignity, Cuba will be free and there will be no
loss of life."

such a cause as thatâ and I think
there have beenâ they have been honest,
brave, human utterances. But when I
enter upon this war I want to enter upon
it with a' united American people. Presi
dent and Senate and House, and navy and
army, and Democrats and Republicans all
joining hands and marching one way. I
want to enter upon it with the sanction

a little pale about the eyes and a little
smile on her lips, but as sure, determined
unerring, invincible as was the Archangel
Michael when he struck down and tram
ped upon the demon of darkness." [Ap
plause on the floor and in the galleries.]
Turpie of Indiana, a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, was next
recognized. He said that he did not see
how we could intervene with arms in
Cuba without making the recognition of
the Cuban republic paramount to every
other consideration. Try as the Senate
might to surround the question with in
volved propositions, one bald fact re
mained, and that was that the Cuban re
public is the underlying fact in the whole
transaction. He said he looked upon
Cuban nationality as the desideratum
because nationality dealt with debt. He
then discussed the Spanish bond question
very entensively, finding in the Presi
dent's message some suggestions as to the
international obligations, which he con
strued to mean Spanish bonds. He re
cited how Gomez had refused to accept
the offer of the syndicate to purchase
the island of Cuba, or to allow the
United States to guarantee the payment
of any indemnity to Spain for the â¢with
drawal of the Spanish flag from the isl
and. Speaking of the right to recognize
the present Cuban republic, Senator Tur
pie said:
"We recognized the Government of
Texas when it had only 800 men under
arms and when it had only 30.000 popula
tion. We recognized the Government of
Hawaii twenty-four hours after the flag
had been raised over the capltol building
at Honolulu, but in this case we refuse
to recognize a republic which has back
of it upward of a million people, who
have pledged their lives, their fortunes
and their sacred honor to maintain it."
Gray of Delaware, a mrmbor of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, said he
would not base his support of Cuba in
this crisis upon anything so inexpressibly
low as to who may or who may not hold
! Spanish or Cuban bonds. Politics ended
' at the shore line. We were here as
Americans to support an American
President. While he supported the com
mittee resolution ho favored the resolu
tion offered by Frye, which is also fa
vored by four other members of the com
mittee. The circumstances and close
proximity of Cuba made it necessary to
intervene now to put an end to the ex
isting conditions in that island.
"We have waited until the situation has
become intolerable." said Gray, "and we
can wait no longer. 1 believe the Presi
dent did everything in his power to secure
an honorable peace, but he has now
turned the question over to Congress imd
we must take the momentous steps which
we a;-e about to take. These are the rea
sons which actuate us in taking this dras
tic step. The nations of the world will
applaud our action, but if they should
not, God help them and the civilization
which they represent. Outraged nature
cannot longer stand what we have been
called upon to endure. God would ImM
us responsible if we continued to hold
our peace."
Gray maintained that the recognition of
independence would at this time be im
srover. Gray concluded with a brilliant
tribute to the American manhood which
would rally to the cry of humanity and
outraged womanhood, and, if necessary',
die to preserve the honor and dignity of
the United States.
Davis chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, In a statement, said he
thought the time had now come for him
I to ask the Senate, owing to the exigen
i cies of the situation, to limit the debate
|in progress. He asked, therefore, unani
mous consent that the debate close at 5
o'clock to-morrow, and at that time a
vote be taken upon the pending resolu-
Objection was made by Daniels of Vir
ginia. Â .
Allen of Nebraska said he was ready to
vote now and inquired of Davis if he
were also willing to vote.
"I should be delighted, replied Mr.
Davis, and he then asked unanimous con
i sent that the vote be taken at once.
"I object." shouted White of California.
White explained that he, among others,
desired yet to speak upon the momentous
i issues before the Senate and expressed
! the opinion that haste would be lnad
i visable.
Teller suggested that the debate, from
! now on, be limited to speeches of fifteen
minutes' duration.
"I object," shouted Daniel.
Davis then made the request that a
! vote be taken at 9 o'clock to-morrow
night.
Allison of lowa said that he was agree
able, and suggested that the last four
hours be devoted to speeches not to ex
j ceed fifteen minutes.
Again Daniel objected.
Returning with another proposition,
| Davis asked that a vote be taken to-mor
'â  row before the adjournment of the Sen
ate. To this objection was also made.
To this objection Chandler of New
Hampshire inquired of Davis if it were
I not his Intention to ask for a continuous
| session of the Senate if no agreement to
limit debate could be reached,.
"Undoubtedly it Is," replied Davis.
Caffery said that no good interest could
be subserved by immediate action. There
could be no aid that would be substanti
ally given to the reconcentrados, who
were the worst sufferers by the Cuban
struggle.
"Those poor people," interjected Mor
gan of Alabama, "are dying at the rate
of 1000 a day. while we are inactive "

of the President, said: "1 will answer the

will go the vessels of pence, loaded with
food and provisions for the starving peo
ple of Cuba, which will be distributed
among them for their relief instantly up
on a landing on the island." (Tremendous
applause on the floor and in the galleries )
Fairbanks (R.) of Indiana then took the
floor- and argued at length to show the
necessity of armed intervention.
Upon the conclusion of Fairbanks'
speech Senator Cullom of Illinois was
recognized, and had hardly spoken a do
zen words before interruption came from
several members looking to an adjourn
ment, Senator Wellington moving that
the Senate adjourn until to-morrow at 11
clock. Whereupon Allen of Nebraska
indicated that he wanted to register his
protest to the position of certain Senators
on the floor who, taking advantage of the
situation, desired to repair their fences
in order to allow the resolution to go over
for another day. The House resolution
relative to the Cuban situation was then

ENOCH ARDEN
IN REAL LIFE
An Interesting Story Re
vealed by a Suit for
Divorce.
After Marrying a Second Time
a Woman Learns Husband
No. 1 Is Living.
Obtaining One Legal Separation the
Surprised Wife Sues Her Sec
ond Spouse.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 14.â T0-day in the
Superior Court an Enoch Arden story
in real life came to lipht during the
trial of the suit of Jessie A. Hendricks
against Albert It. Leach for the annul
ment of an invalid marriage.
The testimony developed that after
marrying and living with Leach us his
wife for over a year Mrs. Hendrickg
was informed last May that her first
husband, M. V. Hendricks, from whom
t^he ha.d been separated for eleven years
and whom she Bupposed to be dead, was
still in the land of the living and that
her marriage with Leach was abso
lutely invalid. â¢
Mrs. Hendricks separated from her
first husband in lowa early in 1886.
After living in Milwaukee the wife
came to Seattle in 1892 and soon after
was informed that Hendricks was dead.
In lSS'rt she was married to Leach, who
now lives in Tacoma. Last May Mrs.
Hendricks received a letter from he
mother giving the startling news that
Hendricks wad alive and was visiting
his old home. Leach and Mrs. Hend
ricks immediately separated and have
not since lived together.
Last February Mrs. Hendricks be^an
a suit in the Superior Court against
husband No. 1 for a divorce. The pa
pers were served on him in Michigan
and a few weeks later the divorce was
granted. The next step taken by Mrs.
Hendricks was to obtain an annulment
of her marriage with Leach. This she
did by the suit tiled and tried to-day.

MITCHELL'S DEATH
UNDOUBTEDLY DUE
TO NATURAL CAUSES
But the Medical Examination
Made at the Funeral Was
Very Sensational.
TACOMA, Wash., April 14.â Great interest has been aroused on
Puget Sound by the strange discovery made Tuesday at Montesano,
when the face of a supposed dead man was found covered with per
spiration. I). C. Mitchell, at whose funeral the discovery created
much excitement, was a prominent Mason, known over the Grays
Harbor country, which fact has lent additional interest to the story in
that section. Yesterday Montesano was much worked up over the
matter, according to advices received to-day. To-day the feeling that
Mitchell was perhaps buried alive has been allayed by the statement
by Dr. French and other Montesano physicians that Mitchell must
have be. 'ii dead, else Dr. Story, who was present at the funeral, would
not have permitted his burial.
YV. (\ Pascoe, master of the Wynoochie Masonic Lodge at Monte
sano, tn which Mitchell belonged, gave to a Call correspondent this
evening the first detailed account of the Btrange occurrence at
Mitchell's funeral to be published. Mitchell died, it seems, last Sun
day at the dinner table, ten miles up Satsop River from Montesano.
Death came suddenly, and the family thought at first he had only
fainted. Restoratives failed, and he was at length laid out and pro
â  i dead. The Masonic lodge at Montesano was notified and
made arrangements for the funeral Tuesday afternoon. It was held in
the Presbyterian church, which Mitchell attended.
Mitchell had many friends, and the little church was crowded. Tears
were in many eyes when the minister closed his discourse, in which
he eulogized Mitchell's good qualities as a husband, father and neigh
bor. Handkerchiefs were being freely Used, as his friends passed up
the aisle and around the bier to take a last look at his face. An ex
clatnatlon of surprise escaped one of the first to view the remains,
and its cause was quickly perceived by all who followed. Mitchell
not only looked as natural as life, but his forehead and upper part of
his cheeks were covered with drops of perspiration. Some of the lead
ing Masons congregated in the rear of the church and decided that an
investigation must be made. Some of them believed Mitchell was still
alive, fur they could account for the sweat upon his brow in no other
manner. Master Mason Pascoe a:so thought that something should
be done.
Dr. Story, himself a Mason, was called upon to examine the
corpse. By this time nearly everybody present had observed the per
spiration, and it required only a word of explanation to inform them
why medical examination -was necessary. With much expectation
and excitement the congregation attain became seated while the un
dertaker removed the lid of the coffin and Dr. Story began an exam
ination. He found the palms of Mitchell's hands turned black, which
convinced him personally that life was extinct. He turned the body
over, finding the limbs so rigid that it required two hands to make an
incision with the knife in the wrist between the bones. If this brought
blood Mitchell might be alive. If not he was dead beyond a doubt.
Not a drop of blood appeared and the doctor made the statement that
he was absolutely dead, This seemed to satisfy MltcheH'B wife and
three sons, in their teens, who ha<* watched the operation' with breath
less interest. The burial was therefore proceeded with.
Subsequently Mr. Pascoe sought the advice of other physicians who
coincide in Dr. Story's view. The talk of exhuming the body for fur
ther examination has died out. The 'theory advanced to-day is that
the perspiration was caused by the body lying for three hours in the
hearse while being driven in the hot sun from Mitchell's farm to
Montesano. Mitchell was 51 years old. Mr. Pascoe also learned to
day that his father, grandfather and great grandfather all died sud
denly of heart disease in the manner similar to Mitchell's death.

Needed This Month.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 14.
Lieutenant D. H. Jarvis, in command i
of the expedition for the relief of the i
ice-imprisoned whaling fleet in the I
Arctic, has made a report to the Secre
tary of the Treasury, dated Norton
Sound, Alaska, January 3, 1898. Con
cerning the condition of the fleet Lieu- j
tenant Jarvis says:
"To-day on 'the ice I met G. F. Til
ton, third mate of the whaling steamer
Belvedere, one of the vessels at Point
Barrow, bound out by way of St. Mi
chael with mail and nev of the posi
tions and c "ition of the vessels for
which this relief expedition was sent.
On account of the situation I opened
such mail as I supposed would give
me Information that might assist me in
the purpose of the expedition.
'"From all I can learn the following ;
is the condition of the fleet: The i
steamer Orca was wrecked trying to
get out September 22, 1597, a total loss,
near Sea Horse Islands, and the same
day, about fmir hours later, the steamer
Jessie H. Freeman was wrecked also, '
about the same place. The Belvedere :
was nearly out, but turned back to
save the crews of the wrecked vessels !
and was cauglit by the ice. There is j
a probability of her coming out all I
right. The schooner Rosario is just
around Point Â»iarrow to the wes^, and
there seems small chance for her
safety. The steamer Newport and the >
Norwegian steamer Fearless are about
fifty-five miles east of Point Barrow.
The steamer Jennie is about eighty- j
five miles east of Point Barrow. The !
bark Wanderer was last seen about
sixty miles west of Herschel Island and i
had not been heard of at Point Barrow
when Mr. Tilton left, October 17, 1897.
"It seems probable that all the ves
sels east erf Point Barrow will be
crushed by the ice. The steamer Mary
D. Hume is wintering at Herschel
Island and it is probable that the crew
of the Wanderer will make for her. !
The crews <>f the other vessels are all j
safe at Point Barrow, excepting some !
tew who are camping on the shore near i
the ships. Their supply of provisions '
has been taken in charge and appor- \
tioned out to last until next July. It j
will be sufficient to last with the rein
deer I will drive there. All the natives '
have been sent to the interior to hunt, ;
and, I think, can (are for themselves. !
I hope to get the deer there by April,
when the most shortage will be. The
steamer Navarch, caught in the ice last .
summer, drifted to the east of Point
Barrow in September and seven men I
were taken from .her, two others refus- !
ing to leave. There are in all about 304 j
men on the ships, including those from
the Navarch and those on the Wan- '
derer, and I should say that transpor- I
tation will be needed for about 250 when
the ice oucns." J

TULARE, April 14.â A fnrce of grnrl
ers consisting of fifty men with ninety
horses commenced the work yesterday
of building: the grade for the Valley
road from Jacobs Well through Tulare
to Visalia.
Jacobs Well is {it the junction of the
main line with the Tulare branch line,
and is located about eighteen miles
southwest of Tulare. The present force
will build grade at the rate of two
miles a .veek, but the number of teams
and men ma" be increased within a
short time, and the construction of
grade will proceed much more rapidly.
The work will be pushed as rapidly as
possible, and track laying will be com
menced as s< m as the construction
force has completed the line into
Bakersfield. JUany men and teams in
the locality can be secured and the
good work of hast uing the completion
of the competing line will go forward
at a rapid pace.
The Tulare-Yisalia branch will be a
healthy and vigorous feeder for the
Valley road, and the closing of the gap
between Viaalia and the main line at
Jacobs Well will be a glad day for
Tulare and this section of the valley.
Tulare will then be a railroad center of
imporntncp, having- the main line of the

VTSALJA, April 14.â Last August T, P.
Beavenc, a confidential agent of Porter

Chicago, was in this city on business,

Now the mystery is cleared. Two Vl

Conclusion of thÂ« Convention by the
Nomination of T. T. Ge?r for
Governor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA, Or., April 14.â The Repub- |
lican State Convention met this morn- |
ing and contrary to expectation there
was no contest over the election of tern- I
porary chairman. The delegates out- |
side of Multnomah County, which has
two delegations, held a caucus and de
cided to support W. L. Tooze of Marion !
County for temporary chairman, and i
he was chosen unanimously.
After the appointment of the com
mittee on credentials recess was taken
until 1 o'clock.
Just before adjournment the follow
ing telegTam was ordered sent to Presi
dent McKinley:
"With utmost confidence in the wis
dom of your administration and pledg
ing you the support of the State of
Oregon, we express our earnest convic
tions that the Maine was destroyed by
design or criminal neglect of Spanish
officers, and that this outrage is just
cause for the United States to drive' the
Spanish nation from the Western hem
isphere."
When the telegram was read the con
vention rose en masse and cheered
wildly for McKinley.
When the convention reassembled
this afternoon the committee on cre
dentials reported in favor of seating the
Simon delegation from Multnomah
County. The report of the committee
was adopted by a vote of 159 to 58. A
recess was then taken until 7:30 o'clock.
The platform adopted contains the
following financial plank:
"VS c are in favor of the maintenance of
the present sold standard; we are un
qualifiedly opposed to the free collide
of Mlver and to all other schemes look
ing to the debasement of the currency
and the repudiation of debt. We believe
that the best money in the world is none
too good to be assured by the Govern
ment to the laborer as the fruit of his
toil and to the farmer as the price of his
crop. We condemn the continued agita
tion for free silver as calculated to
jeopardize the prosperity of the country
and to shake the confidence of the peo
ple in the maintenance of a wise finan
cial policy. We particularly condemn as
unpatriotic the efforts of the free silver
agitators to array class against class and
section against section. We declare that !
the interests of all classes and of all i
sections of. our country alike demand a i
sound and stable financial system.
Concerning the threatened war with |
Spain the platform says:
While we deplore the Imminence of war
we recognize that the country is on the
eve of a war undertaken for the vindica
tion of the national honor and the per
formance of a work dictated by every
instinct of humanity. We declare that
the administration is entitled in this
conflict to the confidence and support of
the t-ntire people.
An amendment to the platform con
demning the action of the last Legis
lature for its failure to organize and
el â¢ t a United States Senator was de
feated.
The following State ticket was then
nominated:
Governorâ T, T. Geer, Marion County.
Supreme Court â Justice F. A. Moore
(n nominated).
State Treasurer, C. S. Moore, Klam
ath County; Secretary of State, F. I.
Dunbar, Clatsop County; State Printer,
W. H. Leeds, Jackson County; Attor
ney-General, D. R. N. Blackburn, Linn
County; Superintendent Public In
struction, J. H. Ackerman, Multnomah
County.
T. T. Geer, the nominee for Governor,
is the first native son of Oregon to ro
ii iv a nomination for that office. He
was born in the Waldo Hills near Sa
lem, forty-seven years ago, and has
lived a farmer ever since. He has
been a member of the lower house of
the Legislature for eight years and in
1891 was elected Speaker. He has al
ways been a pronounced advocate of
the gold standard.
M. A. Moody, who was nominated for
Congressman in the Second District, is
a young man, and is also a strong be
liever in the gold standard.
Damages for a Crushed Foot
NAPA, April 14.â A jury in the Superior
Court to-day found a verdict of $2500 dam

injuries sustained on the 23d of last Sep
tember. Thompson, at the time he sus
tained the injuries, was an employe in

East Napa. Thompson attempted to

and his foot was crushed by the cars.
FRENCH OFFICIALISM.
It is undeniable that France main
tains out of state, county, or local funds
a larger number of officials and func
tionaries than any other country in the
world. It has been well said that in
France their name is not legion but
multitude. When one counts up all the
able-bodied citizens who are employed
and paid by the state, the departments
or the communes, and adds those whose
military service withdraws them from
civil pursuits, one is startled to find
what an enormous amount of product
ive energy is abstracted, and how few
men are left to live their own lives, and
thus contribute to the national growth
in wealth and numbers.
Officialism is not the only sore that is
eating into the French nation. The
causes of the ills it suffers from are
multiple and complex. They are not all
new; some, indeed, are extremely old.
But at the present time officialism, al
though it covers itself with the mask
of conservatism, must be looked upon
as the most active agent of social de
composition. Conservative it appears
to be in the sense that it tends to keep
down initiative spirit and all independ
ence of character, and forms a sort of
nation within a nation, with interests
of its own and a rooted aversion to
changes of any kind as dangerous to
its existence. Confined in the employ
ment in which he clings, the official is
always the ally of the Government of
the day when he is not its slave, or, in
reality, its absolute master. His salary
is generally mediocre, and his style of
life narrow and shabby, but he feels
that it is surer than any other as long
as the taxpayers' money cornea in. â

EDWARD PARKER DEACON
ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM
Wanders Into the World and His Lunacy Is
Betrayed by His Application for a Position
as Seamstress.
WESTON, Mass., April 14 -Edward Parker Deacon, who came
Into prominence a few years ago by shooting his wife's paramour, one
Abeille, In Paris, escaped on Sunday morning from the hospital In
Beverly. Mr. Deacon's room was on the second floor. He made his es
cape by a window at sa. m., eluding his 'attendants, leaping to the
ground and getting away with no worse Injury than a twisted ankle.
Suspecting that a careful search would be made for him and mes
sages sent by telephone to New Britain towns, he walked through the
woods to Weston. Here he got into conversation with a small boy,
who took him to his house to meet his mother. Mr. Deacon's greeting to
her was:
"Madam, I have called to see if I can secure a position as seam-
Btress in your family. I can do light sewing nicely, and have brought
my scissors with me."
The young woman, startled at such a preposterous request from
one of such polished manner, called a physician who was visiting the
family. A few minutes' conversation convinced the doctor that the
stranger was an escaped lunatic. He telephoned to the hospital and re
ceived assurance that a carriage with attendants would be sent at
once. Meantime the family entertained their unexpected visitor as well
as possible, giving him a place at the dinner-table, which he accepted
simply as a matter of course, chatting entertainingly during the meal
of his travels and adventures in foreign lands.
When the carriage from the hospital arrived he made no objection
to going with the attendants, remarking only that they were very good
to send for him, though he thought it would have been more considerate
if they had Avaited until he could have finished his sewing and em
broidery. He was returned to the hospital without any recourse to vio
lence being necessary.

TO BE SHORT OR TALL?
It is a curious fact that the majority
of men don't seem to be attracted by
tall girls. We wonder why? asks an
English critic. Perhaps, remarks the
Chicago News, it is that man is accus
tomed to be looked up toâ at all events
by the fair sexâ and it is only natural
for him to prefer the girl who, in her
little caressings and fascinating lover
like ways, has, o â¢ account of her short
ness, to look up at him for the purpose
of peering into his lovelit eyes. But
very short women can only sound the
note of a forlorn condition, fortu
nately, for fussy, modern man, taking
hin in the abstract, passes her over and
lets his choice fall upon her compara
tively taller sister. The superlative l /
tall woman and the positively short
woman the average man leaves se
verely alone.
Tall women are usually dignified and
would appear to scorn kittenish ways,
and although they manage to draw ad
miration it is rather of the awe in
spiring kind. N<> doubt, owing to their
smallness of stature and piettv pla 7 -
1 ways, men give to little women
more petting than the tall, dignified
woman demands. The lover's oft-re
peated expression, "You little d rljne "
could hardly be applied to the very t 1
girl without tickling the risibilities of
those wh<> overheard it. This is cer
tainly very hard, and looks like a pun
ishment for being tall, but who can
help her stature? And it is a fact, too,
that men are rather shy about ap
proaching tall women, because of re
straint which they feel but cannot ex
plain. They are under the impression
why it's hard to tellâ that 1 _U women
are built to be commanders, and that
they are in their natural element when
l,ft alone in their reserved dignity and
musings in their lonely wanderings.

HOW TO DRINK WATER.
Professor Slikham says there are few
people who thoroughly realize the value
of water aB a beverage, or who know how
to obtain the greatest advantage from it.
The effects produced by the drinking of
water vary with the manner in which it
is drunk. If, for instance, a pint of cold
water be swallowed as a large draught,
or if it be taken in two portions wltn a
short interval between, certain definite re
sults follow â effects which differ from
those which would have resulted from the
same quantity taken by sipping. Sipping
is a powerful stimulant to the circulation,
a thing which ordinary drinking is not.
During the act of sipping the action of
the nerve which slows the beats of the
heart is abolished, and as a consequence
that organ contracts much more rapidly,
the pulse beats more quickly, and the cir
culation in various parts of the body Is
Increased. In addition to this we find that
the pressure under which the bile is se
creted is raised by the sipping of fluid.
And here is a point which might well be
noted by our readers: A glass of cold
water slowly sipped will produce greater
acceleration of the pulse for a time than
will a glass of wine or spirits taken at a
draught. In this connection it may not
be out of place to mention that sipping
cold water will often allay the craving for
alcohol In those who have been in the
habit of taking too much of it, and who
may be endeavoring to reform, the effect
being probably due to the stimulant ac
tion of the sipping.

AND TORPEDOES IN
HAVANA HARBOR
Charles Crandall, Who Worked
for Weyler, Caught by
Detectives,
Run Down by a Cuban Spy the Fellow Admits
Having Done the Bidding of Spanish
Officials.
NEW YORK, April 14.â A special to
the World from Chicago says: Charles
A. Crandall, who, acting under personal
orders of Captain-General Weyler,
planted min^s and torpedoes in the
harbor of Havana, has been run to
earth. To-night he is in the custody of
three United States Secret Service
ts, who will escort him to
Washington, where he is expected to
pivr information to prove beyond any
ile doubt that the Maine was
1 town up by a mine and her 266 officers
and crew murdered designedly by
agencies known to Spanish officials.
Ever since the Maine was blown up
Orandall has been dodging. He was
run down by a Cuban spy, who dogged
him from Nashville to Highwood. a
Chicago suburb, where he was located
by secret service agents early this
evening.
Crandall's statements are substan
tiated by letters in his possession from
officials of General Weyler's staff and
from the writer himself. He says:
"It was while in the United States
service that I made a study of mines
and I I began laying mines
and torpedoes in Havana harbor early
in the spring of 1596, and finished
about a year later. In all seventeen
niines and ten torpedoes were placed.
"The mines wore made in England
and the torpedoes in Italy. In July
last year General Weyler ordered me to
place an additional mine near buoy No.

:- nt for me to visit him at the palace,
with directions that I should appear in
th^ uniform of an officer of artillery, a
uniform being sent me for that pur
pose.

Weyler asked me if it were possible for
a ship to enter the harbor or leave it
GENERAL LEE'S
TESTIMONY
How He Gave Evidence
Before the Senate
Committee.
Declared That Mines Were Laid
in Havana and Connected
With Moro Castle.
It Is Probable a Spanish Officer and
Not â¢ Novice Blew Up the
Maine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ifflce, Kiggs House,
Washington, April 14.
The testimony taken before the Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations in
connection with the investigation into
th.' relation between the United States
and Cuba was made public to-day. It
â¢itutes a book of about 650 pages
and includes not only the testimony
taken since the disaster of the Maine,
but also much that was taken before,
running back for a year or more.
The statement which contains the
greatest cuitent interest is that made
by <' â¢â r.'il Lee on the 12th inst.
In this Genera] Lee said that he was in
formed i in very good authority that the
Spaniards had placed two rows of tor
pedoes just at the mo-uth of Havana
harbor by Morro Castle within the past
two months, or subsequent to the Maine
disaster, and that the switchboard is
in a room in the castle. He said, how
ever, that he had no information of the
placing of any torpedoes before the
Maine was destroyed and none in re
gard to their purchase abroad by the
Spanish authorities.
"Have you any reason to suppose
that the i arbor was mined at all be
fore th" Mowing up of the Maine?"
Senator V:y.
">.*<>, sir; I had no reason to suspect
anything of that sort."
He t!.<-!i w<nt on to say that General
Weyler'a letter to Santos Guzman had
led him to believe that mines might
have been placed there previous to the
Incident, and he said that this
supposition was strengthened by a
telegram from General Weyler, of
v. hi<'h he had cognizance. Upon the
whole h. thought the Weyler letter
(the Lali c letter) was a correct copy
of the genuine letter.
The telegram to which he referred
was addressed to Eva Canela, a noted
Ish woman, and an admirer o-f
< iÂ»*n*rai Weyler, and CO Senor Guzman,
and it read as follows: "Grave cir
cumstances cause n.e to as,W you to de
stroy the last letter of February 12."
General L'-e said that this telegram
had never before been published, and
h>> found in it strong confirmatory evi
den< c of the genuineness of the Weyler
letter.
With reference to the responsibility
for the destruction of the Maine, Gen
eral Lee said:
I am satisfied the explosion was from
the outside. I cabled the State Depart
ment a few days after the board assem
bled that it was almost certain that the
explosion was from the exterior, I have
always had an idea about the Maine that
it was not blown up by any private in
dividual or by any private citizen but
mat it was blown up by some of the of
ficers who had charge of the mines and
electrical wires and torpedoes in the ar
senal there, who thoroughly understood
their business, for it was done remark
ably well.
I don't think General Blanco, the pres
ent Captain-General of the island of
Cuba., had anything to do with it. I don't
think he had any knowledge of it. I saw
him shortly after the occurrence. I was
Bitting in my room at the hotel. I heard
the explosion, and from the balcony of
the hotel saw a great column of lire go up
In the air. A few moments after ascer
taining. that it was the. Maine I went richt
down Â«- â¢>>" Vajjuia and l asked for Gen
with a chain of torpedoes and mines
there. He wanted it to be made abso
lutely sure.
"I showed him my roug-h chart and he
personally directed several changes, es
pecially in channels opposite the navy
yard. I remained in Havana until Feb
ruary 10, when I went to Key West,
where I stayed until March 3, on which
date I received my last Spanish gold
from Havana.
"After the Maine was blown up I
kept in hiding with a colored family
near fort Taylor, or barracks, and as
soon as I received word to skip out I
loft as a stowaway on the first steamer
for Miami. The Maine was anchored
at the identical buoy where General
Weyler ordered me to place the addi
tional mine, officially known as buoy
Xo. 4. These mines were anchored by
cable and chain.
"From Miami I went to Nashville,
where I received a foreign letter from
Havana dated March 1, 1593: 'Destroy
all evidence. Go to New York. Ticket
for London awaits you there. DIAZ.'
"This was from Weyler's most trusted j
adjutant and spy, who executes all of !
the edicts issued by Weyler from Spain. !
I did not gt) to New York, but went to
Bt Louis, and from there came to Chi
cago."
â¢ 'randall has several letters from
Weyler regarding his work and a gen
eral military pass from that office, per
mitting him and five others to work
unmolested and to use any of the boats
of the navy yard at any hour or time
he may apply for one. All of these he
has turned over to the agents and will
be used at Washington. No blame can
bo attached to Crandall for his work
and he was sought for merely to fur
nish proof that there was a mine where
the Maine was anchored.
eral Blanco. He came in directly by hlm-
Belf. He had just heard it, and was cry
ing. Tears were coming out of his eyes.
I â¢â  seemed to regret it as much as any
body 1 saw in Havana. I think it came
from some of the subaltern officers who
had been tlu-re under Weyler, who were
probably antl-i^anco. anyhow, and who

General L< â¢â¢ BaJd that be had seen a

Mam.' explosion, and s.-nt to the Spanish
Commission in London, asking tht- com
mission to "hurry up the electrical
cables."
"Whether that referred to wire for sub
marine mines or torpedoes I don't know "
he continued. "I tried to ascertain if any
of the wire or electrical cables had ar
rived there, but they came on Spanish
snips and 1 could not find out."
General I,ee said that this testimony in
regard to Manterolla and all of that with
reference to the Weyler telegram had
been furnished to the Court of Inquiry
which investigated the Maine disaster
i'i:t h.'id .i not been sent to Congress nor
published because of a request of his
made to the State Department not to
make it public, "as I was afraid the
Spanish papers there would republish it
and they would probably kill the man
who gave it to me."
continuing his testimony General Lee
said that ten minutes after the explosion
he was at the palace talking to General
Blanco and that the latter gave him an
order for a boat to take him out into the
harbor. Senator Morgan asked if, when

| "I did not notice that," said General
i J.ee, t- but I have made Inquiries since
and have ascertained that no electric
lights went out. I sent for electrical
light men and gas men. Some gas jets
went out in one or two places, caused by
the shock or something, but I could not
ascertain from these men that a single
j electric light went out. One of the elec
' trie men whom I called up is a friend of
; mine, and he sent for the man who has
â¢ direct charge of the lights, who came to
; my office. This man said he had not
; heard of any such thing. I said I wanted
to know with certainty. The man then
made explorations of an hour or two
and returned, saying that with the ex
ception of one electric light near the har
bor and one at another place not far dis
: tant where he thought perhaps the
lights may have gone out owing to the
shock, no other electric lights went out "

EPWORTH
CONVENTION
The Big Conference Soon
to Be Held in This
City.
Visitors From All Parts of the
State Will Attend the
Meeting.
A Four-Day Progrsmms of Music,
Business and Recreation
Prepared.
Preparations for holding the California
Conference of the Epworth League in
this city on April 21, 22. 23 and 24 are ac
tively under way. The leading members
of the league are bent on holding a suc
cessful conference. Although they do not i
look to its being as large as the Chris- I
REV. E. P. DENNETT.
tlan Endeavor Convention, they expect a
great deal of good will be derived
from it.
The California Conference comprises a
vast territory 4>X> miles in length and 160
miles In breadth. Heretofore no attempt
has been made to bring together the
league workers. While formal confer
ences and many Inspiring ami profitable
district and county conventions have
been held, the need of a great gathering
of the workers of the entire conference
has long been felt. It was, therefore, de
cided by the leading officers of the orÃanl
zation to hold a conference convention in
this city, it being the central point.
Arrangements have been made with
j the lines of transportation for the spe
j cial rate of one and one-third fare for
I the round trip, and delegates will be met
! at the depots and wharves by members
of the reception committee, who will
wear white c;ips with red bands.
The following appeal for co-operation
| has been sent throughout the State to
j the members of the league and the many
favorable replies lead the committee to
believe that large delegations will attend
the convention:
Dear Brethren and Sisters: "We greet you In
the name of our Lord nnd Master whose we
are and whom we serve. Fur several years

A GREAT CHANCE
FOR HOUSEWIVES
Two New Features of the Ap
proaching Masonic
Festival.
A Complete Kitchen and Bath and
Dressing- Room for Some
Lucky Ones.
Two more merchants have come to the
front with aid for the Masonic festival,
each with a donation that will arouse
the unanimous interest of the house
wives, and will be the source of many
golden dollars to the fund. W. W. Mon
tague & Co. will fit up a kitchen com
plete in every detail, and Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson will furnish a bath room
and iln-ssiriK room.
The kitchen will have a fine range, a
tiled sink, a table with a place for every
thing upon it, and pots and kettles and
pans enough to stock a restaurant. The
whole outfit will go to some lucky house
wife for a dollar, and at the close of the
festival a plumber will call and put it
in place in her kitchen.
The bath room and dressing room will
be fitted up in the finest style, and there
will be nothing wanting which should bo
there. The bath and dressing set will
also go to some one who is lucky, and
doubly fortunate is he or she who may
happen to get moth.
Friday night of the festival has been
set apart for California Commandory,
and a programme is being arranged that
will make it a memorable one. The com
mandcry in full regalia will be escorted
into the Pavilion by the uniformed organ
ization. There will be a dress parade by
the commandery, Captain K. p. Murlbuft
in command, ana then there will be a
flag raising in the presence of a regiment
01 troops, and then General W. JI. L
Barnes will deliver an oration on "The
Flag." The general has promised, too,
thai his effort Wi i be worthy of the oc
casion.
After the oration there will be a pa
triotic drill by twenty-four young ladies,
under command of Captain Hurlburt, who
is noxr training them.
The festival postoffice has been organ
ized, with Charles L. Patton as p'.st
master-general, Louis Roesch assistant
and Miss Amy Cellarius and Miss Voor-
Banger as postmistresses.
The ladles of Southern California have
inaugurated a plan that will certainly
help the festival considerably. Flowers
and fruits are to be sent up daily from
now until the festival is closed, and these
flowers will be distributed in all parts of
the city and will be sold at reasonable
prices. Mrs. Mary E. Drake of Redlands
has undertaken to do much of this work
in Southern California. She has sent
over 100 telegrams to various ladies' in
Southern California, and most of them
have responded, agreeing to send these
flowers at their own expanse.
Mrs. H. J. Sadler of Golden Gate Com
mandery will have an Egyptian booth at
the festival, and will have a series of
wise ones who will tell fortunes Mrs
Jessie Mills and Mrs. C. M. Plum have
secured a great many sofa pillows with
the various emblems of the order, and
these pillows will be in a separate booth
Officer Holland's Will.
The will of Police Officer Poter Hol
land, who died a few days ago, has been
liled for probate. Holland left an estate
valued at $10,000, and by the terms of the
will it is to be distributed among his rel
atives after the payment of $25u each to
Captalfi A. J. Dunleavy, Properly Clork
James Moran and Offlcer Matt Manor,
who are named as executors.

Bush street property owners, residing
between Broderick and Lyon streets, hftve

JAMES A. HERNE
ON HENRY GEORGE
The Author- Actor Believes That
Single Tax Will Free
the World.
Described a3 Ono Who Pointed Out
the Way to the World's
Welfare.
James A. Heine, the well-known author
and actor, lectured at Metropolitan
Temple yesterday afternoon on "Henry
George and Single Tax." There was a
fair attendance, most of the audience
being women.
The speaker was introduced by Henry
George Jr., who is lure for the purpose
of gathering data for a life of his father.
Mr. George, who is a pleasing speaker,
said that it was a sad meeting for him,
because it brought vividly before him the
night, twenty years ago, when he heard
his father make a speech from the same
platform, then dedicating his life to the
cause which took it in the end. He took
great pleasure In introducing Mr. Herne
as a prominent advocate of single tax,
and one who was for years his father's
friend.
Mr. Herne speaks in a simple, conversa
tional tone, something like that which la
Well known to the public in "Shore
Acres" and "The Hearts of Oak." Hi 9
lecture showed wide reading and a tech
nical knowledge of economics.
"Henry George came as a message
bearer," he said, "teaching the blind how
to see. I am one of the blind he taught.
He told and proved that witnout free
land there is no such thing as free men
and liberty."
He described Henry George as a fine
type of the Jeffersonian democrat, a man
who had firm convictions about the rights
of the masses and who was not afraid to
criticize affairs in the busy world.
"In IS7I he turned his X-rays on soci
ety," said the speaker, "and ten years
later he gave it the fruits of his great
discoveries, showing how men may free
themselves and how the masses and the
millionaires may be handled for the ben
efit of the whole people." In conclusion
he prophesied that the doctrines of
George would finally free the human race.

Electricity Cures All Disease.
The cause of disease â of the breaking down of the stomach, liver, kidneys, nerves and vital organs â is the
ack of power to run them vigorously. The human body is like an engineâ it is run by the power of the nervous
system. This power is electricity. Sickness comes when this electricity is exhausted by excesses and bad usage.
Regain it and you get back your health. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt will fill your nervous system with electrical
energy all it can hold of it â every day.
DR. SANDEN GIVES AWAY A BOOK WORTH $100.â This book, "Three Classes of Men," shows how
vitality is wasted by youthful errors, excesses and otherwise. It tells how the power can be regained. It does away
with drugs and uses Nature's own remedy, electricity, to build up vigorous men and women. Get it to-day, free.

F. W. Thompson acted as secretary. The

done and the proposals and consideration
of various plans for making the event at

FAINTS WHEN THE
VERDICT IS READ.
Town Trustee Schomberg Gets a
Verdict for SIO,OOO Against the
Los Gatos Mail.
SAN JOSE. April 14.â The libel suit of
Henry Schomberg against W. S. Walker,
editor of the Los Gatos Mall, for $10,000
damages, was to-day decided in favor of
plaintiff and the costs taxed to defend
ant. Schomberg fainted when the ver
dict was read.
The suit arose over a communication
published in the Mall insinuating that
money had been used in the Board of
Town Trustees, of which Schomberg is
a member, in the securing of town con
tracts. A number of witnesses for the
defense testified that the charges made
were regarded as a joke, but the plaintiff
could not see it in that light.

Mother earth gently heaved her bosem

people were in dread of another such
shock as that which wrought havoc a

serious this time, and while the former
shock was like the struggles of a mad
dened beast the two temblors last night
were but as sighs from the breast of a
weary motherâ a gentle titillation which
Bent gas fixtures and hanging signs
swaying and caused the crockery in
closets to jingle.
There were two distinct Ehocks, the
first at 10:53, and the second at 11:07, but
they were of short duration and smooth
and gentle, none of the ugly pitching and
rocking which characterized the former
shocks being noticeable. They were ft It
for miles around in the surrounding coun
try, but no heavier than here. As far
south as San Jose and up to Port Costa
light shocks were noticed.
Many people, remembering the violence
of the last shocks, feared a repetition
and hurried out of their houses, and the
streets were soon filled with anxious citi
zens, w r ho held their very breaths for
fear. As the excitement from the first
shock was about dying out the second
one came, but it created little apprehen
sion, as people seemed by that time to
have become accustomed to an occasional
prank of the immovable earth and had
begun to think there was nothing serious
in an earthquake after all.

THE LAW NO LONGER MOCKED.
TIME was, and not long ago, when to murder
a man in California involved less risk of any
punishment save that of conscience than did the
stealing of a ham. It may fairly be said that this time
has passed. Now when murderous passion is given
free rein there follows with reasonable promptness a
trial, and. with reasonable certainty, the guilty is
found guilty, the punishment is administered. Delay
has gone out of favor; the senseless and irritating
technicality is no longer tolerated. Several men are
now in the penitentiary' under sentence of death, and
they do not expect to escape. They are acute
enough students of events to know that they went too
late into the business of assassination. Once con
demnation would have meant nothing but the begin
ning of a series of trials. Now it means the paying of
a bitter penalty.
The reason for this change is not hard to trace.
The struggle to keep Durrant from the gallows was
fought with all the ardor of the interested advocate,
all the subtlety that technical construction of the
statute could devise, and yet in the end effort proved
futile. When Durrant went through the trap he car
ried with him the hope of many a bloody-minded
wretch. It was believed then, and months have
showed the soundness of the belief, that the execution
of Durrant would produce marked and beneficial
results. These are already appearing. Before long
the steady processions to the gallows must have vis
ible effect upon the persons wont, in the firm convic
tion that no punishment would follow, to indulge
homicidal tendencies. The record of criminal his
tory shows that there is nothing so disliked by the
murderer as to be hanged, and, given in advance the
assurance that such a fate awaits him, he will stay his
hand.
NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION.
> HERE is a Madrid editor who is in a peculiar
state of mind, and probably threatened with a
touch of fever. As a reasonable measure of pre
caution he ought at least to call in a doctor. He
shows in the following that something is the matter
with him:
"We laugh while our teeth clinch, the bile turns
in our stomachs, anger heats our blood and our
hands instinctively seek an avenging weapon."
Now there is nothing in the condition portrayed
to cause a sane man to laugh. On the contrary, he
ought to grow serious, turn his editorial duties over
to the office boy and go home. A man who laughs
when the bile within him has turned has more to
fear than a disordered liver. He is already touched
by paresis. This in itself, however, may be no par
ticular disadvantage to an editor in Madrid. Per
haps the yellow journal thrives there too.
Laughing through clenched teeth is also a sign of
the abnormal. No genuine mirth is that which comes
hissing from between the incisors. It is a poorly dis
guised anathema. But to laugh while the blood is
boiling in the veins and the hand reaching for a
weapon is the worst of all. In the whole world there
is only one person privileged to do this, and he is the
stage villain. It is his right to begin operations by
ejaculating "S'death" and to finish up with a mocking
"ha ha," this last marking the instant when he sticks
a knife into the back of unsuspecting virtue.
In the kindest of fraternal spirit, and with all pos
sible abhorrence of slang, we counsel the Madrid
editor to soak his head.
The fact that no news as to naval movements is to
be given out hereafter will have no visible effect upon
the yellow press. It has not depended upon the Navy
Department for its "news," and, indeed, has given
that department much information of a surprising
character. If Secretary Long wants to keep track of
his boats he will have to direct a sharp watch on the
Saffron War-Cryer.
Spaniards are said to regard the armistice as a
clever piece of diplomacy, but it is not easy to see
how a trick so transparent can deserve such a charac
terization. Rather it was meant for diplomacy and
turned out to be a bit of buncombe.
Blanco's justly celebrated armistice is very iike the
commutation of sentence a murderer might issue to
himself while on the way to the gallows. It might
comfort the murderer some and in no way delay the
execution.
If anything had been needed to cause this country
to have entire confidence in Fitzhugh Lee the Span
ish papers are supplying it. They are doing him the
compliment to try to impugn his veracity.
It may be set down as a safe proposition that any
measure receiving the approval of Ragan, Drucker
and Waller is not designed for the betterment ; of the
school*, --^
GETTING IN LINE.
THE House fairly lined up with the President.
It was a little mixed in getting there, but it ar
rived, with no more serious incident than the
use of a bound copy of the Congressional Record as
a concealed weapon to determine a question of
veracity. In this there was nothing incendiary, and at
last all but nineteen members voted for the resolu
tion, which conforms as nearly as possible to the
President's policy.
The fact that the minority, after days of embit
tered comment on the message and criticism of the
President that overwent the bounds of decency, fell
in and supported the resolution is very significant.
They are mindful of public opinion and have had time
to hear from the country and to know that the peo
ple are with the President. General Fitzhugh Lee
came home, to make his progress to Washington
through a lane of cheering Americans that stretched
from the Gulf to the Potomac, and when he came to
advise Congress it was to the effect that the Presi
dent was right in counseling that body not to recog
nize Cuban independence under the existing so-called
republic. The yellow sheet in this city, which be
comes more flippant and disloyal in its comments in
proportion as its ignorance fails to grasp the situa
tion, indulges in the incendiary headline, "Congress
Surrenders to the President," and at the same time
editorially commends Lee, knowing that Lee advised
against recognition of the Cuban insurgents' govern
ment and counseled precisely in line with the Presi
dent.
In the excitement of the hour some of the people
may fail to notice this policy of hypocrisy and de
ceit, but it will become common knowledge before
long.
One is amazed at the faulty and fatal leadership of
the minority in Congress which induces its following
to denounce in the most torrid terms a policy which
in less than a day it also leads them to vote. The
party in the country which that minority is supposed
to represent will grow tired of such folly. That party
was in precisely such a way led during the Civil War
into the wilderness of defeat, where it wandered for
more than half of forty years.
The President and the House now stand together
on the Cuban issue as an American question solely.
If war is the best for American honor and interests
there will be war, and it will be fought to the right
conclusion by American pluck and valor. The House
and the President have isolated Spain. In her inter
national horizon there is no ray of hope for an al
liance with any Continental power. The policy of
the minority would remove her isolation and give her
allies.
Judge Maguire, by a strange inversion, if not per
version, of reasoning, says that the House action, for
which he voted, invites European intervention, when
that is just what it prevents.
Intervention may be offered whether invited or not.
If offered it will be declined because no European
question is raised. If Spain treat the House action as
a cause of war, it is a cause that raises up for her no
allies. If her dismemberment occur as an incident of
such war, as it will, the fault is hers, not ours.
But if we begin with a demand for her dismember
ment and make her refusal a cause for declaring war
against her, the whole cleavage of the issue is
changed. It then becomes a European question and
she would probably find allies.
The country intends to stand by the President and
Lee, who stand together.
THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
tZIJROM reports submitted at the recent meeting of
â  the Board of Regents it appears that the affairs
*â  of the State University are in a flourishing con
dition, and that the outlook for its improvement in
many ways is most excellent.
In the first place it was noted that the endowment
fund is now valued at $1,941,000, and while there are
some fears of a diminution of this by reason of a
possible depreciation in the value of real estate, the
prospects that the fund will soon reach the $2,000,000
are most excellent. Public interest in the university
is increasing, and donations are likely to increase with
it at an equal ratio.
An evidence of this increase of public interest in the
institution is afforded by the fact that the meeting was
called upon to consider no less than three donations,
two of them being of considerable value. These
were the donation of J. K. Moffitt of $100 to be used
in the purchase of books for the library, that of the
Alaska Commercial Company of an almost priceless
collection of Alaskan articles, and that of Mrs.
Phebe Hearst of a sum of money amounting to
nearly $12,000 to defray the cost of a needed addition
to the mining laboratory.
Another pleasing feature of the meeting was the
letter from Professor Keeler accepting the appoint
ment as director of the Lick Observatory. The name
of the professor has already been associated with the
observatory by reason of the work which he per
formed there while acting under Director Holden,
and his coming, therefore, will not be regarded as in
any sense the importation of an outsider, even if such
an importation were objectionable.
In his acceptance the professor reminded the re
gents that he is a Californian by affinity, inasmuch as
his father was a forty-niner, but this claim was not
necessary. The professor was himself one of the
pioneers of the observatory and did much to give it
an early prestige in the world of science, and it is for
that reason as well as for his fitness for the position
that he will receive a welcome to his new office, not
from the regents only, but from all Californ^ns who
know his abilities, and on that knowledge base a
hope of increased repute both for himself and the ob
servatory while he fulfills the duties of its director-in
chief.
Taking all things into consideration, it is evident
that the new movement in the university which be
gan a short time ago is rapidly advancing. When the
great plan of arranging for new and stately buildings
and ornamental grounds has been definitely decided
upon and the full scope of it is made public, the long
expected new era of the university will be at hand.
State patriotism and private munificence will then
unite to make the institution the foremost of its kind
in America, and not inferior to any in the world.
According to the English Consul at Havana
Americans remaining in that city are in no danger.
It must be remembered that the American flag hav
ing ceased to fly there, a great source of irritation has
been removed.
According to an English critic such ships as the
lowa and Indiana are for the purpose of tickling the
imagination. Yet the Spanish are an imaginative
people, and they do not seem to be tickled the least
liitle bit.
Spain regards Weyler as a hero. This country
looks upon him as a scoundrel who deserves to be
: hanged. There is reason to fear that an understand-
L Â£?!?Â£ will be difficult to reach. -^
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 1898.
THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
AN esteemed correspondent calls our attention to
the fact that in presenting a statement of the
prerogatives which will be exercised by the
Mayor under the proposed new charter we have
omitted to mention that among the administrative
bodies to be appointed by him there is a Civil Service
Commission. It is the opinion of our correspondent
that this was an important oversight. He thinks that
the Civil Service Commission will provide the Mayor
with a key to the entire municipal situation, as
through it he may confer respectability upon his po
litical machinists and foist them upon even those
heads of departments who may attempt to resist his
will.
Our correspondent, however, is mistaken in think
ing that we unintentionally omitted to name the Civil
Service Commission as one of the administrative
bodies which are to be appointed by the Mayor. We
ignored that board with malice aforethought. To
our mind the commission as outlined in the charter
is certain to prove a useless expense, if not a laugh
able farce. Its members are to be chosen by a Mayor
who will control practically the entire municipal gov
ernment. How a thing thus created could stand be
tween the powerful Mayor embodied by the charter
and the political patronage of the city is a
problem which time could solve in only one way.
It is our opinion that the first, or at least the second,
Mayor elected under the proposed new charter would
refuse to appoint any Civil Service Commission at
all, for undoubtedly sharp lawyers could find some
rational excuse for advising that the whole scheme
is impracticable or invalid. But even if the commis
sion were regularly appointed and its work carried
out, nothing could prevent the selection of adherents
of the mayoralty machine.
We did not include the appointment of the Gvil
Service Commission among the important functions
to be performed by the Mayor under the proposed
new charter for the reason that we regard it as a use
less appendage to the government â a mere sop to the
reform element which the politicians would subvert
or refuse to execute. Even if the Civil Service Com
mission under the charter were a practicable body it
would never be able to stand up against the pressure
certain to be exerted from the outside to overturn its
rules. We all know that the politicians in "doing"
politics trade offices â State, Federal, municipal and
county. The commission would have to resist not
only the influence of the political bosses of this city,
but that of the bosses of the State and adjacent towns.
It never could survive the ordeal, no matter how well
intentioned its members might be nor how deter
mined to perform their duty.
If the first Mayor created by the charter did not
laugh the commission to scorn, even if he were forced
by public opinion to appoint three men who would
attempt to execute its powers in good faith, it would
be because he was not a humorist.
THE INVASION OF MflNCriUÃlfl.
AN article in a recent number of the Nineteenth
Century by a prominent British officer ex
plains to some extent the anxiety manifested
in England at the operations of the Russians in Man
churia. Recent news indicates that the designs of
the British upon this province are being to some ex
tent threatened by the persistency with which Rus
sians are pushing their way eastward. Sir William
Harcourt once said that England has no great trade
interests in countries where the people wear no
clothes. It is not surprising, therefore, that English
men should be more anxious about affairs in China
at the present time, where the people wear clothing,
than about occurrences in Africa, where the colored
population usually appear in society quite unadorned.
Captain Yountrhusband, the British officer to whom
reference has been made, states that the greatest
forests and the best timber left untouched on earth
are located in Manchuria; navigable rivers traverse
the land in all directions; there are rich mineral de
posits, soil that yields readily to cultivation and a
hardy population of about 20,000,000 which has never
been fleeced by the Caucasians. The captain esti
mates that Manchuria would easily support double
the number of people who now inhabit it, and he does
not wonder that all the western nations are casting
covetous eyes upon it. Certainly British trade in such
a locality must have high possibilities, and that Eng
land should sit down and see the country overwhelmed
by the Russians is out of the usual order.
What is to come from the Russian invasion, how
ever, is yet to appear. The latest" news indicates that
the Russians have actual possession of the north of
the province and are in control of the principal sea
ports. There is no doubt that by building a few rail
roads and scattering a few traders over the country
they will ultimately gain control of everything. The
Chinese are too weak to oppose them, and it is not
exactly plain how the British are going to place ob
stacles in their way.
It must be noted that in plundering the weak na
tions of the Orient the Caucasians of the west are
exceedingly punctilious. They always have a valid
excuse for their movements and take possession of
property that does not belong to them only after
careful deliberation. There is but one ground upon
which the British can march upon Manchuria, how
ever, and that is that they are better "civilizers" than
the Russians, which is probably true.
School Director Waller seems to have an uncon
trollable faculty of placing himself on exhibition. He
cannot realize that he is at his best in repose, and in
a state of activity constitutes an unpleasant display.
Before this little affair shall be finally settled there
will be a general understanding that the practice of
expelling American Consuls on penalty of death
does not meet with the approval of this country.
For some unaccountable reason the Cisneros
woman has not come forward with an opinion. Pos
sibly the people who found her have had the great
good fortune to lose her again.
By the vigor with which the Spanish papers attack
thr message it is apparent that the document has
points of merit which Americans may have over
locked in a hasty first reading.
Mr. Huntington's boast that he will be good for
thirty years yet could perhaps have been more cor
rectly phrased. He means evidently that he will last
for that length of time.
Three highwaymen tried to rob a groceryman, and
the row he raised about it resulted in their capture.
The up-to-date groceryman does not keep his sand
in the sugar.
Evidently the colored troops remember that they
have the reputation of having fought nobly, and pro
pose to live up to it if given the chance.

\^J The directors of the Omaha Exposition thought this way when
they decided to have the features of the loveliest women in all the
West on the Medallion that is to commemorate the big fair. But
the directors were equal to the occasion. They decided to make a
composite of all the combined loveliness in the West and let it be a repre
sentative of our womanhood. This work has already been started. In fact,
is pretty well under way. Many of the beauties from some States have al
ready been decided upon. There will be some beautiful pictures of them
IN NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL.
And you can find out all about how the work is being conducted by reading
the article that accompanies them.
There is one young lady in this city who had longings to be a man. As

through life in masculine attire. She tried it for a while, but soon repented
of her act and went back to skirts. The reasons that caused her to change
her mind are all given
Of course you are interested in the Paris Exposition. Everybody is. To

There Is trouble now along the hostile Wabash

For her legs are not twelve feet or over long.
There are waves around the home, but not of

Oh, the moonlight may be fair along the Wa

And the sunlight may be ditto through the

But beneath the waters of a new spring ocean

In the hope the sweeping flood might catch

WARS OF THE REPUBLIC,
PREBLE TUCKER, writing in the
New York Sun, speaks as follows of
the war records of the United States
and other great nations of the world:
It may not be inopportune at this time,
when certain timorous ones are express
ing doubts as to a war between the
United States and Spain, to look up our
fighting record, as the sporting fraternity
would put it.
From the Declaration of Independence
to the present day, a period of 123 years,
the United States has waged five wars,
not to speak of the numerous Indian and
border skirmishes, and in every one our
flag has come out on top. Can as much
be said of any other nation during the
same period?
England has had during that period,
roughly speaking, six wars, not including
its fights with the natives of South Africa
and Northern India and the opium war
in China. Of these six, â the Ameri
can Revolution and the War of 1812 â re
sulted in victory for; her opponents. In
other words, to again use a sporting term,
she lost two out of six events.
France had also six wars, not counting
her fights in Northern Africa and China;
of these she lost two â war with the
allied powers and the Franco-Prussian
War. . â¢
Prussia out of her five wars waged dur
ing the same period lost two.
Austria lost three and gained two.
Russia lost two and gained two.
Spain has lost every war she has under
taken during that period, unless her ten
years' war with Cuba should be placed
to her credit as victory. So much for the
record. In analyzing it we find that most
of the cases in which a European nation
has won it has been in alliance with some
other nation, as in the war of the allied
powers against Napoleon, the . Crimean
War, and the Franco-Italian-Austrian
War. ; -. . ,
In onÂ« case only did the United States
have an ally, and that was in the Revo
lution. Even- then the war , was nearly
half over when France came to our as
sistance with a fleet and a few thousand
troops as an offset to the Hessian troops
employed by England. In our two wars
with England the United States was tre
mendously outclassed in all that goes to
make the fighting efficiency of a nation
except bravery and endurance. In our
war with. the Barbary States the odds
were not so greatly in our favor as they
appear at first blush; we were fighting
thousands of miles from home, a naval
power that had exacted tribute from
every maritime power in the world and
was secretly backed by the money and
moral support of Great Britain

THE NUMBER SEVENâ H. C. McG..
Bodega, Cal. The common statement that
seven implies perfection has no further
foundation than that the cabalistic mean
ing of all odd numbers are modes of per
fection. In 1624 William Inghen. writing
about the number seven used the follow
ing language:
First, it neither begets nor is begotten, ac
cording to the saying of Philo. Some numbers,
indeed, within the compass of 10, beget, but are
not begotten, and that is the unaiie. Others
are begotten, but beget not. as the octonarie,
only the septanarie having a prerogative above
them all. neither beget or are begotten. This
is its first divinity or perfection. Secondly,
this Is an harmonioal number, and the well
and fountain of that fair and lovely dla
gxamma, because it inoludeth within itself all
manner of harmony. Thirdly, it is a theo
logical number consisting of perfection.
Fourthly, because of its composition, for it
is composed of 1 and 6, 2 and 5 and 3 and 4.
Now every one of these being excellent of
themselves, how can this number be but far
more excellent, consisting of them ail and
participating, as It were, of all of their ex
cellent virtues. It was esteemed a sacred, sym
bolical and mystical number. There were the
seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, seven days of
the week, seven branches of the candlestick
of Moses, spv.Â»n liberal arts, seven churches of
Asia, seven mysterious seals, seven stars, seven
heads of the dragon, seven joys and seven
sorrows of the blessed Virgin, seven peniten
tial palms, seven deadly sins, etc.

night's meeting, for its members do not
approve of "refreshments" at political
meetings; In fact, the other league, which
perhaps light not be inaptly designated
the Davis .League believes that it has
pained a material point in Young Men's
Republican League ethics by the invita- \
tion of Mr. Powers. The Davis League
is to have a meeting next week, and if
invitations are sent out it is almost cer
tain they will contain the words "no
refreshments," and Mr. Pulcifer and his
followers declare that such a hint will be
the most effective barrier in keeping their
opponents away and preventing having
i.) send for the police and the breaking
of any more chandeliers. >
It is now rumored that Murray Laidlaw,
who was partly responsible for the break
ing up of the Pulcifer League meeting
last week, has burled his little hatchet
and will henceforth be a meek and lowly
follower of President Pulcifer. It is,
however, plain that there can be no such
thing as harmony among all the members !
of the rival leagues. President Bilger's !
league is avowedly a Pardee organiza- I
tion. Mr. Pulcifer, who says he has not j
less than 168 enrolled members, cannot |
01" necessity head anything but a Davis i
organization, consequently it has been
proposed that the two factions carry on
their separate organizations and call
themselves by the names of their re
spective choices for Governor. This is
suggested as being the only possible way
to prevent a repetition of the scene that
occurred last week and for which each
faction is holding the other responsible.
There is also a smaller matter than the \
nomination of a Governor which is having j
some influence on the present disagree- j
ment between the leagues. Harry Pul
ciftT and J. W. Stetson are anxious to )
secure a nomination from their party for
Justice of the Peace. It is hardly likely
that the league will take up two candi- !
dates for Justices, alnd therefore it would j
be likely to give its support to one or the
other. Should there be a Davis and- a
Pardee league one would work for Stet
son, the other for Pulclfer, and the har
mony that they all profess to so greatly
desire would be brought about.
The Davis men are chiding the Pardee
men with training with the "Courthouse
gang-." Two months ago this serious
charge might have been sustained; but
the ' Courthouse gang" is just at present
in a very demoralized condition, and it
Is difficult to say which of the factions in
the county buildings Is really "the gang.
Evidences are daily cropping up that the
only original "gang" is becoming disin
tegrated, and there Is no knowing how
far this will go, so that before many
weeks, and long before the convention,
it is quite possible that there may be
both Davis and Pardee "gangs" at the
Courthouse. The main factor in break
ing up the Courthouse combination is the
quiet but insidious and powerful element
that has no love for either of the pro
posed gubernatorial candidates. Its great
est hope of success is in splitting their
opponents into two camps and setting one
faction against the other, thereby pro
ducing distrust and ill feeling, which,
when accomplished, makes the rest of its
work easy. - Â«/,>;
ADAMS RICH ENOUGH.
His Manager Knocks tUe Basis From
"a Sensation."
KT.ANn. April 14. -Arthur If. Breed,
manager for Edson P. Adams' real estate
was amused to-day to read a
U Btory in a morning paper that
mployer has no property which can

â¢ is nothing sensational in the ind
oor is there any truth in the state
ment that Mr. Adams has no attachable
property.
The judgment Is In favor of Darby Lay
don & Co., who had a dispute with Mr.
lama concerning the building of his
wharves. The case has been in the courts
nearly two years, and the judgment was
granted some time ago. On Monday last
Mr. Adams' attorney secured a stay of
execution, as he still has what he be
lieves are me legal resources in the
premises. Attorney McPlke, who ap
peared for the contractors, objected to the
stay of execution. Mr. Adams owns a
large share of the Adams estate, which
stands of record in his name, he is the
president of an opulent wharf company,
has bit blocks of stock in two banks,
besides other investments. Deputy Sher
iff Harlow nays the instructions of Mr.
Mi Pike were to serve the garnishment
upon the two banks. In case ot an exe
cution against real estate, it is custom
wry for the attorney to furnish a descrip
tion of the property and the Sheriff is not
supposed to exceed his instructions or to
search the records.
Mr. Breed says that no one can doubt
that 11 Mr. Adams is finally held to be
It gall; responsible to Darby Laydon &
Co. for J2MO, the sum will be speedily
forthcoming.

They are under arrest on a charge of
haying entered Sanford Brothers' meat
market and Buslach'a grocery at Bay
station last night.
The window in the rear of the meat
market -was found open this morning.
Investigation showed plainly that some
person or persons had been through the
premises and had gone from there into
! the grocery-store, which adjoins, and is
| only separated by a screen partition.
Once, in tne meat market, the thieves
; had no trouble in forcing an entrance to
the grocery. The intruders took nothing
, from the meat market, so far as could be
â¢â¢t .lined. From the grocery were taken
just such articles as boys wouldt be apt to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 1898.
LYNN SAID TO
BE A LUNATIC
Doctors Disagree Over the
Symptoms in His
Case.
Will Escape the Penalty of the
Attempt to Kill His
Wife.
Judge Ogden Will HÂ«ar Mora Testi
mony and Make an Order
To-Morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 14.
The man who attempted to shoot his
wife and who was accredited with being
concerned in the death of Mr. Camarinos
at the Agnews Asylum was declared by
Drs. Barber and Rabe this morning to
be insane.
The examination of J. W. Lynn has so
far occupied two days, and the testimony
taken was of such a conflicting nature
that the doctors could not readily agree
upon a verdict. Even now Dr. H. N.
Rucker, a former superintendent of the
Stockton Asylum, Health Officer Dunn
and Winslow, a nurse, do not accept the
judgment of the two doctors, but believe
that Lynn is a schemer.
During the proceedings the fact was
brought out that Lynn's mother is at
present an inmate of Utlca Asylum, at
New York, where Lynn was an attend
ant for eleven years. He is of a very
jealous disposition and some time ago
was Injured on the head, and these are
held to be the predisposing causes of his
insanity. Lynn believes, or professes to
believe, that three men make continual
visits to him, place an electric battery on
his neck and lill him with the fluid. He
professes to continually hear voices
which speak ill of him and also assumes
to believe that he is In danger of great
bodily harm from Invisible men who are
ever around him.
His commitment ends the trial for the
attempted murder of his wife, and the
argument of the prosecution made yes
terday that Lynn, whatever his condition
of mind may now be, was sane when he
shot his wife, will have no effect.
In discussing this question Dr. Barber
said: "We must be perfectly impartial
and look into the reason for each one
giving his evidence and discover if they
are moved by any bias. The fact that the
man's mother is in an asylum suggests
hereditary insanity, and while he may
have been shamming In Jail it may have
induced insanity under the conditions
and circumstances. We have nothing to
do with his condition at the time of his
attack on his wife, and gave our verdict
on his present condition."
Lynn was brought before Judge Ogden
this afternoon, so that the court could
pass upon the recommendation of the
doctors regarding a commitment. He was
so violent that it took five men to hold
him, and the examination was continued
till to-morrow afternoon.
AUTHORITIES ABB ANGRY.
Pranks of College Students That May
Lead to Serious Consequences.
BERKELEY, April 14.â Captain Emll
Kellner, superintendent of the university
grounds, and Armorer Mitchell are
wrathy over some practical jokes that
were perpetrated last night on the col
lege campus by a crowd of students. The
crowd started out early in the evening
to charivari their fellow student, C. F.
Balaam, the story of whose romantic ee
cret marriage to Miss Gwynedd Carnoll,
a middler in the Berkeley High School,
was published exclusively in yesterday's
Call.
After serenading the student-husband
and his bride the crowd repaired with
horns and tin cans to the college grounds.
Wheels were taken from the water carts
that were standing on the campus and
hoisted to the tops of the electric light
poles, from which they were removed by
the university police this morning after
some difficulty. A number of tin cans
were also hoisted to the top of the uni
versity Hag staff, and this in particular
angered the university authorities. Five
years ago similar pranks had become
common, and the president iÃSued a
warning that any student ever caught
interfering with the llag pole would be
summarily dismissed. It is charged also
that the revelers effected an entrance In
to the armory and toon a quantity of
blank cartridges, which they subsequent
ly used to make a noise in the college
town.
An investigation of the affair has been
instituted by the college authorities, but
President Kellogg this evening declined
to state just what had been learned or
what course will be pursued with regard
to the offenders.

ILLEGAL FISHERS SUFFER.
An Important Victory Won in the
Courts of Mendocino
County.
The members of the California State
Fish Commission are rejoicing over a
victory recently achieved in Medocino
County In a case of two men arrested for
violating the fish laws. Last December
Deputy Griffiths arrested William Walker
and Frank Ogden for illegal fishing in
Garcia River. The men had a small
i mesh net utrung across the river, which
; is about 200 feet wide at that point. They
\ were held to answer anu last Tuesday
I Ogden was taken before the Superior
Court, where he was found to be guilty
by a Jury. At the preliminary hearing
Ogden testified that the net did not ex
tend all the way across the stream, but
j that he had doubled It back by one
third. Several witnesses gave the same
1 story as to the length of the net. At the
hearing of the case he was confronted
with his previous testimony, and he was
sadly mixed up when he learned that the
net he had imed was about 400 feet wide,
which left ovÂ»r 200 feet unaccounted for.
and the jury believed that the officers
had told the truth.
The case against Walker was set for a
later date, as there is a charge of high
way robbery pending against him. The
effort to save Ogden was very bitter, as
his conviction will not benefit the case of
Walker. District Attorney G. A. Sturte
vant has worked well in the Interests of
the commission, even in the face of much
local opposition. The Commissioners be
lieve that this conviction will have a
beneficial effect upon those who for years
have totally disregarded the law. The
smallest fine that can be imposed is $100.
Deputy Davis had sent word to his su
periors that on Tuesday he arrested G.
and A. Demazzio of Black Diamond for
fishing for striped bass. The net they
were using was of a very small mesh.
The prisoners were taken to Suisun for
trial.

GALLI WINS, YET LOSES.
A Verdict Against the Railroad That
Meant to Him a Loss of Money.
A Jury in Judge Daingerfleld'a court
yesterday rendered judgment for $250 in
favor of Michael Galli and against the
Market Street Railway Company. Galli,
who is an expressman, was slightly
burned about the hands by coming in con
tact with a live electric wire at the cross
ing of Market and Third streets. The
wire became detached from one of the
poles used on the Third and Kearny street
electric car System. It would have been
better for Galli had the jury found for
the railroad, as the amount of judgment,
being under $300, does not carry costs
with it. Galli win. in consequence, have
to pay three days' jury and court fees,
besides paying his counsel and the costs
of announcing the suit. The jury fees
alone amount to $105. and when, the other
costs are paid. Galli will lind himself a

LAND FOR THE
MONKEY RANCH
City Attorney to Be Instructed
to Sue for Its Con
demnation.
Report Adopted by the Street Com
mittee ol the Board of
Supervisor*.
In spite of the vigorous protests here
tofore made by the residents of the Mis
sion, there is an evident determination
on the part of the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors to impose upon
the taxpayers of this city the expense of
establishing and maintaining a refuge for
monkeys and other cheap and nasty
beasts, 'which is by a stretch of courtesy
referred to sometimes as a park and zoo.
At a meeting of the Street Committee
yesterday the Initial step waa taken
toward acquiring the Gum Tree tract for
use as a public preserve for monkeys.
The committee adopted a report recom
mending that the City Attorney be In
structed to begin proceedings for the
condemnation of the land .-eaulred for
the zoo. This report will be submitted to
the Supervisors on Monday.
John H. Grady, on behalf of the M!b
sion Park Association, presented a report
reciting that the owners of the property
required for the park were not satisfied
v.-ith the prices they had been offered for
their land. It was in view of this fact
that condemnation proceedings were sup-
Kestod by the committee. It was further
recommended that the area purchased be
reduced so as to exclude tract No. 8.
valued at $&o.oofl and comprising 24.50
acres, and a portion of tract NO. 5, valued
at Jl2,f>oo. This would reduce the appro
priation required by $62,500. The commit
tee reported that it was unable to se
cure figures from the owners of the small
triangular pieces of property required for
the proposed boulevard connecting Mis
sion street with the Halbua boulevard.
They recommended that these pieces of
land be purchased outright when the
other lands were bought. It is estimated
that the total amount required for the
proposed boulevard will not be more than
(6000.
A protest was presented by the business
men r>f Market street to the repeal of the
ordinance requiring the renumbering of
the south side of that thoroughfare. They
claimed that they have already complied
with the ordinance to a great extent and
have Incurred considerable expense in so
doing. __________
DISAPPEARED
IN THE NIGHT
An Overcoat Purloiner Badly
Wanted by the De
tectives.
Hackmen Art His Victims, and Many
Reports Have Boon Made, but
Without Avail.
Detective Ryan (ho of pawnshop-search
ing fame) Is at last cornered, or, In other
words, completely at sea regarding many
thefts which have occurred recently.
Within tlic l )a - st few d a >' 9 & clever crook
has been watching his chances along the
streets, and his mania seems to be over
coats, although the weather has been
unfavorable for such wearing apparel.
His victims, without an exception, have
been hackdrlvers, and when the oppor
tunity presents itself he slowly walks to
the hack and takes a coat, if one Is within
reach, and then, running toward an ap
proaJhing car, loses himself in the gloom
or a crowd.
Edward Dellex is the last complainant,
and he reported to polite headquarters
that he was minus a valuable heavy coat
: which he always tarried with him during
i the long night watches. Detective Ilyan
was detailed on the case, but has so far
been unable to gain any clew to the
locality of the thief or the coat. Last
evening a thief, who is supposed to bo the
same person, again made his appearance
and took away a second coat from Del
lex, and in consequence the driver is now
wearing a borrowed article, which is not
removed even during the hot spells, for
' fear that the man may again claim what
does not belong to him.
The hack stand is in front of the Phelan
building, and last evening when the theft
! was committed, John Brocks, who lives
in the neighborhood, saw the man take
' the article, but whs unable to follow l)im
, or give a description of the guilty party.
I It is thought by the. police that but one
crook is concerned in the thefts, and it
is hoped that an arrest will soon follow.
All the pawnshop* in the city are being
investigated, with the object of gaining a,
description of the man, provided he
should visit one of the places for the pur
pose of parting with his ill-gotten gains.

from here two years aeo, released on
parole.
Many prominent people have signed a
petition to the prison directors setting
forth the facts In the case and stating
that there is a great deal of reason and
merit In the efforts of the boy's mother,
Mrs. Wagner.
Since his term commenced young Ma
jors has been a model boy at Folsom.
Warden Aull and those who have been
closely acquainted with his career are
unanimous in testifying to his good be
havior. There are at this time many
powerful arguments being put forth why
the boy should be given a chance to show
whether he will behave himself out of
prison, if released.
Before entering on his romantic career
of crime, a few weeks before his arrest.
Abe Majors was always a good boy and
did all he could to help support his
mother and younger brothers after they
were deserted by their father. His elder
brother Archie, also the son of Majors,
the first husband of Mrs. Wagner, was
of a wild disposition, never did anything
for the home, and since his brother's Im
prisonment has not helped his mother in
any way.
Mrs. Wagner says that shÂ© has no
doubt Abe was induced to enter a life of
crime by some one older than himself,
he being only 16 at the time, and she feels
convinced that if he be paroled he can
obtain work in Oakland and can live down
the odium of his boyish romantic crim
inal career. When on the coast nearly
a year ago, Mrs. Ballington Booth took
special interest in the boyish convict, and
in a letter to his mother said that when
Abe had served a year Mrs. Wagner
should try to get him released condition
ally and she would help all In her power.
The boy has now served two years, and
to-day Mrs. Ballington Booth sent out an
appeal, which may have some weight
with the directors on behalf of the boy.
Several judges and prominent attorneys
have attached their signatures to the
petition, and it is generally believed that
It will have some weight.
MRS. ELLA EAGLES
WILL GO TO WAR
She Wants to Bo With the
American Army as
a Nurse.
Her Application HÂ«s Brought Her
Prominence That She Now
Greatly Dislikes.
Mrs. Ella Eagles of 776 Hayes street has
gone into hibernation on account of the
notoriety she has Invited by writing to
the adjutant-general of the United States
that she was burning with an ambition
to go to war as a nurse, should hostili
ties arise between the United States and
Cuba.
Mrs. Eagles lately received a note from
the Governor's private secretary an
nouncing that her name was on the reg
ister as a volunteer nurse. The matter
reached the newspapers in crurse of reg
ular war news, since which time sho has
taken to sack cloth and ashes, refusing
to see reporters or friends, hesitating
at meal time and regretting that she of
fered her services before the beginning
of hostilities. But the fact is that Mrs.
Eagles ia seized with a desire to go to
battle and she regrets that she is not an
able-bodied man capable of bearing arms.
Mrs. Eagles was a little Buckeye girl
when the late war broke out. She re
members that seven of her brothers went
to war and that one never came back.
She heard those who returned tell of the
horrors of battle, of the sufferings of the
wounded and of the great aid rendered
by women in the nursing department. It
was then that she made up her mind to
become a nurse if there should ever be
a war in her time.
Mrs. Eagles has been in California for
fifteen years, having buried her husband
five years ago at Los Angeles. As she
has no children she feels free to go to
war as a nurse. The fires of patriotism
burn in her breast, but she' is sorry that
ehe ppoke of the matter before the firing
of the first gun. Her friends and rela
tives beg her to give up the idea, but
she clings to It with rare tenacity and
thinks she will be one of the first among
all the volunteers and that her applica
tion is probably the first that has been
sent in from this State.
Will Leave the Street.
Mollle Woodward was arrested yester
day by Sergeant Martin on a complaint
sworn out by W. N. McCarthy, owner of
the Hotel Langham building, charging
her with keeping a disorderly house on
Mason street. She was released on ?100
cash bail. She told the sergeant that she
was willing to give up the house, and
had so informed Attorney Regenshurger,
who represents the complaining witness.

Farewell.
Released for Total Disability After
Twenty-Eight Years' Service and
Escorted to the Train.
Martin Carmody of Battery H.Third Ar

D. C, having been released from duty
after twenty-eight years of honorable
service. He was escorted to the Sunset
Limited yesterday afternoon by a party
of his old comrades, who were detailed by
Captain J. J. O'Hara to bid him farewell
and wish him happiness in his home,
which he will establish in the Capitol
City.
His discharge was solely on account of
a disabled condition, and he departed
from his duties in a manner befitting his
actions during his long term of service.
There was not a better liked man in me
battery, but age has again told its story,
and one more who was willing to labor in
behalf of his Government has found his
usefulness gone. He had asked for his
discharge, and it was regretfully granted
after a few days' contemplation.

THE GEBHARDT
TO HUMIDITY.
The Hindoo Filly Ran Cir
cles Around Her Com
pany in the Stake.
The Handicap Captured by
Grady After an Exciting
Finish.
Elamore Scored Â«t Odds of AO to 1.
Two Favorites In
Front.
The colors of Burns & Waterhouse
were carried to the front in the Geb
hardt stake for two-year-olds, decided
at Oakland yesterday, by Humidity, a
brown filly, by Hindoo, from Calphur
nia. Under the conditions, she had a
pronounced pull in the weights, get
ting in with 107 pounds in the saddle.
Away in the lead, the daughter of Hin
doo made all the running, and at the
wire won. eased up from Sevens, the
second choice, in 1:02. The winner,
coupled with Obsidian, ruled favorite in
the betting. The stake winner, rid
den by Dick Clawson, earned $1300 for
her stable.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap,
with a field of six going to the post,
furnished the most exciting finish of
the afternoon, Grady, Flashlight and
the favorite, Eddie Jones, finishing
heads on the wire. Grady, trailed by-
San Venado, made the running until
well on toward the wire, where Thorpe
on Eddie Jones put in his challenge.
The pair were at it hammer and tongs,
when Spencer on Grady came from be
hind with a terrific rush, snatching vic
tory by a nose in 1:48. Flashlight was
second a scant head before the Burns
& Waterhouse entry- Six to 1 was
chalked against the winner.
The Kittleman Bros, furnished the
favorite in the opening seven-furlong
run. Myth ruled an even money
choice, but Gray took matters too
quietly the first part, and when he
made his run in the stretch, the geld
ing would not respond. In a hurrah
drive at the end Thorpe got
Sly in winner a half length before
Judge Stouffer. The favorite was un
placed. The winner was a 6 to 1
chance.
The Longrstreet filly, Bonita, was
played down to 2 to 1 favoritism to win
the mile selling affair, and also failed
to get inside the money. â¢ In a furious
drive the last part, Elsmore, a 40 to 1
shot, ridden by Mclntyre, got the ver
dict from the second choice, Midian, by
a head, in l:42Vs- Floronso finished in
the show.
Morinel, the shifty daughter of llo
rello, downed an ordinary field in the
seven-furlong run, fifth on the card, the
best of the bunch being Bitter Root
and Montallade. The latter was a
pronounced favorite, but could never
Ket to the front. Bitter Ro<:Â£ looked
a possible winner at the paddock, but
was beaten out rather easily by Mort
nel.
Tom McOowan scratched Rubicon
from the last number, a mile and a
sixteenth run, and San Marco won eas
ily. The chestnut horse was backed
from 8 to 5 to 8 to 5, and. catching Cas
par in the run home, stalled off Treach
ery and led the mare over the mark
nearly three lengrths.
TRACK NOTES.
R. B. Mllroy, secretary of the California
Jockey Club, received the following message
from Martin Nathenson. secretary of the Har
lem Jockey Club: "We will hold a meeting
beginning on May 24 and ending June 24. Will
give fifteen stakes with from $1000 to $2000
added, entries for which will close on May 15."
Frank Brown, owner of Blarney Stone, King
William, Double Quick and others, leaves for
the East to-day. He will probably be accom
panied on the trip by Dal Hawkins, the light
weight boxÂ»r.
Old Red Glenn received strong backing in the
betting on the opening event, and came like a
tornado at the end, taking the show. Tne
ring laid 50 to 1 against him.
Mistleton ran in the colors of the Elmwood
Stock Farm. Mr. Boots almost has a corner In
Brutus stock.
There was plenty of 40 to 1 against Elsmore
at post time, and It went begging. The Burns

& Waterhouse cast-off won through a. streak of
good luck, for some of the horses behind him
got wretched rides.
None of the two-year-olds out this way seems
to l>e able to pick up weight and continue
winning. Oltnthus, Formero and Saintly are
shining examples of this assertion. Of the
r.llles, Nick Hall's Sevens appears to be the
best. Magdalenes is possessed of a tremendous
burst of speed, but seems to have gone all to
pieces.

THE SYMPHONY
AND THE OPERA.
Ten Thousand Dollars Worth of
Melba Seats Soldâ Concert at
Tivoli â Paloma's Recitals.
I This week will have a record of about
a dozen concerts, big and little â too many
for the pecuniary fortunes of their pro-
I moters and the musical health of the
j town. Even yesterday's symphony con- J
I cert at the Tivoli suffered a big drop in ;
patronage, although the programme was (
an alluring one and Mr. Scheel and his i
band were in fine condition. The symphony
was Schubert's C major, which Mr. Scheel
played with such careful facility and il
l lumination and cumulative power that
j the tremendous length and difficulty of
I the work were hardly put to question.
Schumann's "King Manfred" overture j
was finely played, too. except in the clos
ing measures the band was a bit too rigid !
in answering the expressive treatment ,
signaled by the leader. A short symphonic '
poem by Urban, very spirited and humor- j
ous and descriptive of "The Ratcatcher of j
Hammeltn," was played with delightful
spring, and the "Parisian Bacchanale," '
from "Tannhauser," was given in ail its j
gaudy lasciviousness. In both programme '
and performance the concert was notably !
] successful.
All the town is talking Melba, and from
dawn until the closing of the box office
there was a steady line of ticket-seekers
at the California yesterday. The day's
receipts were in the neighborhood of
$10,000. the greater part of which was paid
for the higher priced seats. Melba will
open on Tuesday night In "Traviata";
Thursday night she will sing in "The
| Barber" and Saturday in "Lucia,"
Little Paloma Schramm's precocious
piantstry arid Improvisations amazed an
other audience at the Sherman & Clay
Hall last night. Her farewell recital
takes place this afternoon.
One of the most important musical an
nouncements of the season is that Bee
thoven's Ninth Symphony will be per
formed with the orchestra of sixty and
a chorus of one hundred and fifty at the
benefit to be given Fritz Scheel In the
Metropolitan Temple on the afternoon of
Sunday, May 15.

Recent Desertion* From the

The following special order was is
sued yesterday:
Headquarters Department of Califor
nia:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.,
April 14, 1898.
Special Order No. 31.
(Extract)
IâA1 â A board of officers to consist of
Colonel Marcus P. Miller, Third Ar
tillery; Major Edward Field, Second
Artillery, artillery inspector; Captain
Sedgwick Pratt, Third Artillery, and
First Lieutenant Eugene T. Wilson,
Third Artillery, will convene at these
headquarters at 11 a. m. to-morrow,
the 15th instant, for the purpose of
formulating a fire-control system for
the artillery stations in San Fran
cisco harbor. The system will in
clude all the batteries at present
completed and in the process of con
struction, and will also keep in view
the extension of the system to in
clude all projected batteries. The
board is authorized to confer with
Colonel Charles R. Suter, corps of
engineers, for any information that
he may give that will be of service
to it in the performance of the duty
assigned to it. It is important that
this work be completed with the least
practicable delay.
Upon notification by the president
of the board, tiie different post com
manders will afford all facilities for
the prosecution of the work enjoined
by this order.
The junior member of the board
will act as recorder.
Such journeys as may be made by
the members of the Doard in the exe
cution of this duty are necessary for
the public service.
By command of
BRIGADIER GENERAL SHAFTER.
J. B. BABCOCK,
Assistant Adjutant General.
Official.
Some beautiful theories about con
centrating the flr<s of the mortars
twelve-inch breech-loading rifles, the
ten-inch breech-loading rifles, and
the dynamite guns cm an enemy's ves
sel will doubtless be presented to the
board. Firing according to the range
finder, the charts and at signals con
veyed by telephone to electricians may
be all right for long range work and
particularly applicable to the mortars
and dynamite guns for anyÂ»range, but
at short range it may become neces
sary to train the ten and twelve inch
rifles directly cm the floating object of
attack.
General Shafter may decide to test
the new-fangled theories on some old
hulk before adopting any arbitrary
system for fire control. The old-fash
ioned way of training a gun directly
on a ship works remarkably well a*t
close range. The members of the
board are practical and experienced of
ficers and will doubtless submit a
scheme for firing that will render the
cannonading highly effective.
Preparations for war continue with :
undiminiPhr-d vipror. Yosterday Gen- I
eral Shafter received orders from the !
Secretary of War to send five hundred
tents from the quartermaster's stores
In San Francisco to St. Louis. The
tents will probably be shipped to-day.
The purpose of General Miles to con
centrate a large force of the regular
army in the vicinity of Chattanooga
and Atlanta will probably be carried
out. Private Intelligence from Wash
ington indicatps that there has been
some little difference of opinion be
tween General Miles and the Secretary
of War regarding the scheme of mo
bilization. It is supposed now that
Gfnpral Miles has persuaded the Sec
retary to authorize the concentration
of the troops at Chattanooga or At- j
lanta. The tents ordered by wire yes- I
tcrday will probably be used for the ]
troops that will assemble at some point |
south of the Tennessee River.
The First United States Infantry Is
Ptill awaiting the order to go aboard
the train. Everything that comes to
light indicates a determination on the
part of General Miles to utilize the
services o-f this regiment at some other
point than San Francisco.
Rooent orders have been issued en
joining secrecy as to the plans of the
military arm of the service. The fol
lowing circular was issued yesterday
by Colonel Mi!'-s, commanding the post
at the Presidio:
PRESIDIO, &AN FRANCISCO, Cal.,
April 14, 1898.
Circular: Hereafter the gatekeep
ers will keep the gates of the reser
vation locked from 9 p. m. until 6
a. m. The gates will not be unlocked
for parties to enter or leave except
by order of the post or department
commander.
Whenever the gates are unlocked
after hours the facts will be reported
to the post commander. By order of
COLONEL MILES.
E. E. BENJAMIN, Adjutant.
<">rdÂ«rs received yesterday from head-,
quarters of the army direct Second'
Lieutenant Frank A. Wilcox, Company
C, First Infantry, stationed at the
Presidio, to proceed at once to Fort
Monroe, Va., aid report to Captain
Thomas L. Casey, corps of engineers,
for temporary duty under his immedi
ate orders.
Since last November Lieutenant Wil
cox has been on duty at department
headquarters in the office pi. th% /en
glneer officer of the Department of Cal
ifornia, in connection with the progres
sive military map ordered by the Sec
retary of War.
Just prior to this date Lieutenant
Wilcox returned from a year's course
of instruction at the United States En
gineer School at Willets Point, N. V.,
| where his ability in connection with
i torpedoes for harbor defense and ex
periments with the same was recog
nized by his superior officers. His pres
| ent assignment under Captain Casey,
who is in charge of the defensive works
at Hampton Roads, Va., is a well-de
served detail for this young, energetic
I officer.
Lieutenant Wilcox bade good-by to
his friends at the Presidio and the Bo
hemian Club yesterday and got aboard
the Central overland train for the East
last evening. He wasted no time in
making his preparations to go to the I
front. Mr. Wilcox is familiar with the
system of suhmarine defense of San
Francisco harbor and his departure at
this time is a source of regret to the
engineer officers of the Pacific Division,
who are charged with the duty of
planting torpedoes in the channel. The
work is well advanced, however, and
should emergency require the immedi
ate employment of experts, citizens
skilled as electricians, may be em
ployed to assist the engineers.
General Shafter, accompanied by
Lieutenant Miley, Fifth Artillery, aid
and Engineer officer, went to Benicia
on the Government steamer General
McDowell yesterday and inspected Ma- i
jor Smith's battalion of the First In
fantry, stationed at Benicia Barracks.
The inspection was thorough as to the
troops, the equipment, clothing and
transportation outfit. The general
found that the battalion was ready to
take the field for active service with
out a minute's delay. The troops re
garded the visit of the department
commander as an indication that
marching orders would soon be given.
There was a red glow in the sky over
the Presidio last night. Observation
brought out the fact that it was
caused by massing artillery colors at
a mess dinner of the Presidio Club.
Lieutenant Colonel Wallace F. Ran
dolph, Third Artillery, who was re
cently promoted and assigned to duty |
at this station, was the chief guest at
the dinner last night.
There is such a scarcity of water at
the Presidio Reservation that the com
manding officer has ordered that all
the garden hose in the hands of officers
and organizations be turned over to
the quartermaster's department. The j
watering hereafter will be done under i
the direction of the head gardener.
The commander of the post has is
sued an order directing that men of the
infantry and cavalry on signal drill
shall not be given passes except on Sat
urdays and Sundays.
There was considerable talk among
the enlisted men at the post exchange
yesterday concerning desertions from
the garrison. Private William Vine
yord, Company G, First Infantry, is re
ported to have deserted on the 13th.
An artilleryman of Captain Dane's bat
tery is missing, but it is conjectured
that he did not desert. He left his pa
pers, a month's pay and same allow
ances. Officers commenting on his ab
sence hold to the theory that he has
been "shanghaied" or made away with I
in some other manner against his will.
Investigation of the rumor that de
sertions have been frequent of late does
not verify the assertion that the num
ber thus leaving the service is unusual.
Desertions occur at every large garri
son like the Presidio. Many soldiers
have been carried away by the glitter
ing stories of wealth acquired in the
Klondike country. Many good soldiers
whose terms of enlistment recently ex
pired and who were expected to re
enlist have disappointed their com
manding officers by preferring to take
a trip to Alaska before rejoining the
service.
A soldier of the First Infantry com
menting on the recent desertions said:
"This shows that a few of the men are
getting cold feet and do not want to
go to the front. It is better that they
should go now than later on. Every
regiment has a few men of this kind,
but the percentage of such is very
small in the First Infantry."
Captain Starr of the First Infantry
remarked yesterday that the percentage
of desertions had not increased since
the war talk began. Considering the
number of troops stationed at the Pre
sidio he regarded the desertions slight.
Colonel Miles, the commanding offi
cer, holds to the idea that the few men
who have deserted recently have been
tempted to leave by the stories from
the Klondike.

Such Is the Opinion
of the Coroner's
Jury.
Inconsequence the Police
and Morgue Officials
Disagree.

tigating the Case.
REPORTS SOON TO FOLLO
More Than Probable That an Inter
esting Controversy Will Ba
the Result.
Once more a Coroner's Jury has
plung-ed the police and Morgue officials
Into a controversy which may result
in as bitter opinions being expressed as
in days recently gone by.
This time the differences in opinion
have resulted from the death of an
WHERE LOUIE WEE JUNE MET HIS DEATH.
unfortunate Chinese cook, by name
Louie Wee June, who was found In a
hovel at 814 Washington street with
two bullet wounds in his abdomen. The
Morgue was notified, as was the Police
Department, and the investigations
went merrily on.
Yesterday afternoon a Coroner's Jury
met for the purpose of determining the
cause of the death of the Chinese and
returned a verdict of death from inter
nal hemorrhages following wounds, and
further that he came to his death by a
Kor parties unknown. The verdict
approved by Coroner Hawkins,
he conclusions of the detectives
lad been detailed on the case that
s suicide seemed to be as naught.
In many instances the Coroner and
heads of the Police Department have
agreed to disagree on such cases, and
now the detectives are again working
on the case to establish, if possible,
conclusive proof of suicide. The room
in which the deceased met his death
has been carefully gone over and every
one in the building who might possibly
throw light on the case has been close
ly questioned.
The police believe the theory of sui
cide is correct from the fact that there
is but one small window in the room
where the shooting took place and that
is over twenty feet from the roof below.
Also that the outside door was se
curely bolted when the other cook in
the building went to arouse his "boss."
The Coroner's jury, however, were
doubtful as to how the Chinese could
have twice wounded or shot himself
with a large caliber revolver in a vital
spot, but the police reply that the
wounds were merely superficial or at
least one was.
The situation of the room; the potvder
marks on the dead man's flesh; the
closed doors and the fact that the cook
had no enemies known to any of the de
ceased friends; that he had gambled
heavily for the past few months as
well as suffering from an old complaint
is what the detectives rely on and the
fact that two wounds were found on
the body was the cause for the verdict
as above given by the Coroner's jury.
However, there the matter rests and
while the detectives are still working
on the case the members of the jury
have gone their way. little thinking of
the turmoil which may follow a verdict
opposite to that hoped for by many
who had investigated the facts and cir
cumstances surreunding the death of
one Louie Wee June.
San Francisco Yacht Club.

Th<*re will be a meeting of members or
the San Francisco Yacht Club on April
27 to consider the adoption of the pro
posed new by-laws.
The following new members were elect

The question of the San Francisco

general feeling of the directors was that
the club ought to become a member of
the association, and would do so if the
association would meet it half way. In

Amicable Settlement of a Damage
Suit Against the Pacific Koll
ing mills.
When the case of Mrs. Mary Wood
head, who sought to recover $10,000 dam
ages from the Pacific Rolling Mills for
the death of her husband, who was killed
at the Hall of Justice building last
Christmas evening, was called for trial In
Judge Hunt's court yesterday Attorney
Goodfellow, representing the company,
said that he had an offer to make looking
toward a settlement of the litigation. He
said that while the company disclaimed
any responsibility for the death of "Wood
head, although he was in its employ, it
was willing to pay his widow $1000 cash
in addition to defraying the costs of the
suit; guarantee her a home for three
years, paying $15 a month for the rent of
the house, and also give her two sons
employment at the mills while they
worked faithfully.
Judge Hunt said that the terms of the
compromise were the fairest he ever
heard, and he advised Mrs. Woodhead to
accept the proposition. Her attorney
was also of the same opinion, and acting
on their advice given Mrs. Woodhead ac
cepted thn terms of settlement and judg
ment in favor of the company was en
tered.
DID NOT CONDUCT
PULPIT AND BAR
Charles Montgomery Put In a
False Light by Bill
heads.
Says Ho Conducted the Silver State
Hotel on Temperance
Lines.
In The Call of April 2 an account of
various rows between landlord and ten
ants at the notorious Silver State Hotel
portrayed Charles Montgomery as con
ducting a religious revival in the base
ment of the hotel and a saloon on the
ground floor.
Investigation reveals the fact that Mr.
Montgomery was put in a harsh light be
cause of the fact that his successors, who
conducted a saloon in connection with a
transient rooming-house, continued to
use letter-heads that ' announced Mr
Montgomery as manager of the entire
business. The gentleman denies that any
of the servants of ; the house were de
frauded while he was â  manager of the
hotel. There are few persons in San
Francisco s=o well known in charity and
Christian work as the gentleman who was
thus set forth as conducting: a saloon

ANTHONY WAS
DISAPPOINTED
His Witnesses Were Not
Called to the
Stand.
Inquest on the Body of Mrs.
Vidal Cervantes by the
Coroner.
Verdict by the Jury of Death From
Natural Causes â An Unsatisfac
tory Autopsy.
By the action of Coroner Hawkins, at
the request of the Police Department, in
exhuming the remains of Mrs. Vidal Cer
vantes and holding an inquest, her hus
band has been officially exonerated from
the suspicion entertained by Detective
Anthony and friends of the deceased that
her death was the result of foul play.
The remains have been again laid away
to rest, and the verdict rendered by the
jury of "death due to natural causes"
will allow the whole matter to rest so far
as the authorities are concerned.
Mortification had set in before the ex
humation of the body, and for this reason
the autopsy made by Autopsy Surgeon
Gallagher, in the presence of Dr. Ragan,
who appeared on behalf of the husband,
was not at all complete or satisfactory.
Dr. Gallagher explained afterward that,
owing to the progress of decomposition,
the autopsy was of little value. He found
some signs of dilation of the heart and
hardening of the first part of the aorta.
a he stomach and other alimentary organa
were delivered to Dr. C. L. Morgan,
chemist for the Coroner, for analysis.
At the inquest yesterday Dr. Morgan
testified that he found morphine in tho
stomach, but not in sufficient quantity to
cause death.
Dr. Artigues repeated the prescription
which he had given Florentino Cervantes
to have filled. It was composed exclus
ively of poisons, and was as follows:
Sixty grains of lodide of potassium, 30
drops of tincture of belladonna and Oi)
drops of tincture of lobelia; dose, a table
spoonful every two or three hours until
relieved of the pain caused by the asthma
with which the deceased had been cutler
ing. He also ordered ten morphine pow
ders of one-sixth of a grain each, one
powder to be taken every three hours
until sleep should be induced.
The only time ho was called in to see
the patient was on March 29, a day before
death took place. She was gasping for
breath, and he fr'.und that the woman
was suffering from an intense attack cf
asthma. He found symptoms also of
fatty degeneration of the heart. Next
morning a man from Marini, the under
taker, came to him and asked him to sign
the death certificate, but the doctor re
fused to do so, because he had seen the
patient only once before her death, and
he told the man that probably some other
physician had been called in after he
(Artig-ues) had left.
After the young man had gone away
Undertaker Marini called on the doctor
and requested tnÂ« doctor to sign the cer
tificate for the one visit, promising to
take it to the Coroner and have the Cor
oner sign it. Dr. Artigues then signed the
certificate, setting forth that death re
sulted from heart failure and asthma.
Hans Nellsen, agent for Mrs. Vidal Cer
vantes, told how the deceased came to see
him the day before her death and said to
him that it was almost the last time he
would ever Bee her alive. She explained
that she was suffering from the effects of
an overdose of medicine administered to
her by the servant girl; that the dose j
prescribed by the doctor was from twenty
to forty drops, and the girl had given her
200 drops. She became very sick, and was
obliged to send for a doctor. The witness
was not positive whether this conversa
tion took place before or after the mar
riage.
After -^rs. Cervantes died a woman and
Mr. Cervantes called upon Nellsen for the
personal property of the deceased. Cer
vantes informed Neilsen that the deceased
had mentioned him as having worked for
her for many years, and had requested
him to remunerate Neilsen for his past
services. He offered Neilsen $500 at first,
and afterward increased the offer to $1500.
Felicitas Navidad, a Mexican woman,
testified that the deceased told her Cer
vantes had been urging her to make a
will, but that she had refused to make
any will because she did not believe she
was married to Cervantes.
Florentino Cervantes is a swarthy,
good-looking young man, employed as a
leather-worker in a Montgomery-avenue
estabishment. He married the deceased,
he said, on Marcn 21 of this year, and rihe
died nine days afterward. During her
illness he and the bridesmaid waited on
the sick woman. He never saw the brides
maid before the day of the marriage, and
she was not a relative of his. Although
appointed special administrator, he had
turned over the estate to the Puhlie Ad
ministrator. He denied that the deceased
had made him a present of $2000 or ui.y
other sum on the day of the wedding. She
never gave him as much as 1 cent. He
found $90t> belonging to her in her box in
the safe deposit vault.
The witness denied also that Neilsen
hnd asked him for any money or that he
had offered Neilsen any. He had told the
witness that he had two lawyers, who
would sue the estate for wages due him
by the deceased for his services. Cer
vantes said it was not necessary to pet
lawyers, because he (Cervantes) would
pay him well, the. deceased having recom
mended that he Bhould do so.
With regard to the cherry pectoral, the
witness said he swallowed two teaspoon
fu!s of it ... mself before he administered
a teaspoonful to the deceased.
After Coroner Hawkins had sent out
the jury to deliberate upon the case, De
tective Anthony loudly expressed, his dis
satisfaction with the manner in which the
inquest had boen conducted. He pointed
out to the reporters several witnesses
whom he had in attendance and who had
not been given an opportunity of telling
what they knew about the case. He said
he was disgusted and that he had never
in his experience seen an important mat
ter rushed throurn so hastily.
The verdict of the jury was based on
the testimony of Chemist Morgan, to the
effect that there was not enough mor
phine in the stomach of the deceased to
cause death and that there were evi
dences of disease of the heart.
It is likely that the inquest has ended
the matter so far as the police are con
cerned.
MRS. LEVY'S DEATH.
A Verdict of Suicide Rendered in the
Case of the Unfortunate Woman.
A Coroner's jury yesterday brought in
a verdict of suicide in the case of Mrs.
Catherine li'evy, a divorced woman, who
killed herself by taking carbolic acid on
the 7th inst.
Harold C. Price, a witness, denied that
he and Charles W. Wilson, who sum
moned the police to Mrs. Levy's resi
dence, were acquainted with the de
ceased. They saw a man dressed in blue
take the bottle of poison from Mrs. Levy
in front of the drugstore on the corner of
Third and Natoma streets and then re
turn it to her.
Th-;y Will Be Lanaed.
Collector Jackson was notified yester
day by the Secretary of the Treasury
that 220 Chinese would arrive at this port
on the Gaelic, due on the 23th inst. The
Chinese are on their way to the Omaha
Exposition as actors, jugglers, artists
nnrl exhibitors, and should be allowed to
pass on in peace, they having agreed to
return to China after the close of the
exposition.

COMTE DE BAUVIERE SUED.
His Groom Charged With Having
Run Over a Lady Bicyclist Dur
ing a Paper Chase.
Comte de Bauviere was made the de
fendant in a suit for $299 99 yesterday.
The plaintiff is Lottie Voorsanger, aged
15. who brings the action through her
father, S. Voorsanger.
Tt is alleged in the complaint that Allen
Drysdale. while in the employ of the de
fendant as a groom, led a paper chase,
and that while so engaged ran into the
plaintiff, who was riding a bicycle, and
inflicted injuries on the plaintiff and to
her wheel to the amount prayed for.
THE STRIKE
IS EXPANDING
Printers Will Be Called Out of
the Office of Byron Ring
To- Day.
Union Men Say They Will Begin an
Aggressive Campaign at
Onoe.
The officers of the Typographical Union
now declare that they have exhausted all
their patience In waiting for the employ
ers to make some attempts at a settle
ment of the difficulties, and will begin
aggressive work at once and in such
manner as either to bring about a settle
ment of the difficulty in short order or
force somebody to the wall.
"We have been waiting for nearly two
weeks now," said President Hawkes yes
terday, "hoping to see our way clear to
settling the difficulties without being
obliged to work against some of the men
who have employed us for years and have
heretofore treated us fairly well. Things
seem no nearer a settlement than they
were two weeks ago, and we intend to
force the issue. The Typothetae are
holding daily meetings. They are all run
ning short-handed, and some of them are
practically closed down, waiting for the
old hands to come back, but making no
efforts to get them back beyond trying to
persuade some to break their faith with
the union."
The Typothetae has a similar tale to
tell, and enrich it with stories of the
eagerness of the old hands to get back.
A meeting was held yesterday afternoon,
and while it was rumored on the street
that it was a very stormy one, nothing
was given out either to the printers or
the pubic. A rumor was current to the
effect that the union had offered to com
promise on nine and a half hours and that
the Typothetae was favorably consider
ing the proposition, but it was denied by
both parties.
The executive committee of the union
held a meeting last night, and on infor
mation that the employes of Byron Ring
were assisting in getting out the work of
a non-union office, decided to call out
their men. This office has been very
closely connected with one of the ten
hour offices, and had been notified that
it should not in any way assist the non
union offices, but despite this, it is de
clared, the manager persists in com
pelling his employes to help out the
non-union offices; hence the action.
Another Electric Car Victim.
Augustus D. Price, administrator of the
estate of Margaret D. Price, who died on
the 22d ult., commenced suit yesterday to
recover $10,000 damages from the Market
Street Railway Company. He alleges that
Mrs. Price's death was due to injuries re
ceived by her on December 2, last, by be
ing struck and knocked down by an
electric car of the Third street line near
the crossing of Everett street. The claim
is made that the car was being run at
an unlawful rate of speed, and that the
motorman neglected to warn pedestrians
of its approach by sounding the gong.
Beautiful Cantata To-Night.
The beautifiil little cantata of "Golden
Hair and the Three Bears" will be pre
sented at the Stewart Memorial Church,
Guerrero street, near Twenty-second, to
night by an excellent cast of characters.
The participants have devoted consider
able time in preparing for the event and
the large chorus has been carefully
trained by a competent instructor. After
the close of the cantata refreshments
will be served in the parlors of the
church.
Suits in Foreclosure.
George A. Rankin, William Riphy and
"W. G. Zeigler commenced suit yesterday
a.painst Joseph Gutliberlet and his wife,
Mary Guthberlet, to recover $302S S9 on
three promissory notos. and to foreclose
a mortgage on a piece of property on
Stockton street near Greenwich.
Sarah H. Webster commenced suit yes
terday against Ada C. Friend to recover
$13,000 on a note executed July 22, 1892,
and to foreclose the mortgage on a piece
of property on Octavia street near Pacfic.

The gasoline yacht Lucero Is to go into
commission again and this season she will
be seen almost constantly on the waters
of the bay and along the coast. Of all
the many pleasure craft that have been
built for wealthy Ban Franciscans the
liiicero is the one that has done least for
her owner's enjoyment. It is not the

This makes the new board of the same
composition as the old with one excep
tion. George Crocker was elected to fill
the place ol 11. T. Scott, who resigned
for business reasons which had been
talked over and mutually agreed on. Mr.
Scott's resignation* is not accompanied
by any unpleasantness, but is merely
from the fact thai he has so much other
business to attend to that he has not the
requisite time to devote to the duties of
a director.
The number of shares voted at the
meeting was 152,287. The new board of

forms that body that all litigation in ref

square has hern ended by the recent de

WILL CLIMB UPON SHARPENED SWORDS.
Another San Francisco girl will climb the perilous path that leads to the
heights of fame upon a ladder of burnished and sharpened swords. La Belle,
the peerless change artist and equilibrist, after an absence of two years from
the vaudeville stage, is about to return to the boards in an act of mar
velous sword walking, that was originated and performed many years ago by
the wife of King Sabro, the great Japanese juggler.
La Belle is better known to her many friends here as the wife of P. J. But
ler, who for several years past has faithfully served the interests of the Or
pheum, with which house he has been connected. She was one of the famous
Kirbys, and her last appearance here was in a high-wire bicycle act. After her
marriage she retired from the stage, but some time ago made up her mind to
return to it, and with the assistance of her husband, who is identified with her
in the new act, they have originated something new and wonderful. The team
will be known as La Belle and Zero, and they will appear in the Orpheum cir
cuit about the middle of June.
For the past two years they have been quietly rehearsing their act at Wood
ward's Pavilion, and have brought it to a high degree of perfection. It consibts
of feats in equilibrium, burlesque acrobatics and comedy juggling. La Belle is
a dark brunette of very slight build, but of wonderful strength, and in one part
of the act she holds her husband above with uplifted arms.
The sword walking is the most marvelous portion of the turn that the young
woman does. Up a ladder of swords that have been sharpened until their edges
are like those of razors she climbs by balancing herself until she has reached
the top. To accomplish tne act she has been forced to submit her feet to a
method of treatment to so soften the flesh and at the same time toughen tne
skin that when she places her foot upon one of the swords the flesh will gently
give beneath the weight of her body and sink to the bone without cutting the
skin. So sharp are the swords that she has to maintain a perfect state of equi
librium or else run the chance of cutting open the entire bottom of her foot.
She also hangs by her toes from a crossbar and disrobes. The couple have
many friends, who will await their appearance here with much pleasant antici
pation, and whose best wishes for success go with them in their venture.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 1898.
A RAY OF LIGHT
IN THE SHADOW
Pleasures of Show Night
at the County Alms
house.
The Little Chapel Crowded With
an Enthusiastic Audi
ence.
Circus Performances Will BÂ« Given
on the Grounds Monday
Afternoon.
Out at the Almshouse road, in the
dimly lighted chapel, last night wa? a
scene of human character and a study
in human nature which, if it could but
be thrown on canvas, would produce a
picture alike in interest to the moral
ist, philosopher and the man of or
dinary intPlligpncp. The long-looked-for
event of the month among the 900 in
mat ps of the institution had returned,
and with it the usual enthusiasm and
enjoyment whlrh comes as a ray of
sunshine in the arid desert of misery
in which the unfortunate beings live,
isolated and renouncing: every sense
and manifestation of pride in the ac
ceptance of the aid which comes from
public charity.
The monthly entertainment, given by
philanthropical charitable talent from
the different parts of the city to cheer
the old folk and make the burden of
life seem less hard for at least an hour
or so, comes like the beacon to a dis
tressed ship, the sight of water to a
traveler on the great desert. All are
anxious and look forward to show night
with eager expectation, but only a
fraction of the entire number of in
mates are allowed to be present. As the
chapel is hardly large enough to ac
commodate 300 persons the rest are
compelled to dream again for another
month.
The prevailing feature of the per
formance seems to center In the at
tractions afforded by that human joke
called the song and dance man; other
attractlons, such as recitations and
songs, unless they possess a tinge of
comicality, being relegated to second
place. ThÂ» amusement lasts about an
hour, or at most two hours, and pro
duces the effect upon the old people of
the keenest enjoyment.
The feelings of the older inmates,
whose natures seem dead to all exter
nal impression, become so worked upon
by the antics at some performer that
self and surroundings seem to be en
tirely forgotten, and life seems, for the
moment, to hang to the limbs and
grimaces of the fun-maker. An un
usual joke, a comical skit, a funny
song provokes the wildest enthusiasm
and most deafening applause from the
audience.
Quite frequently it happens that some
old fellows In the corner will see some
thing funny in a certain twist, of the
performer and the little chapel echoes
with a sudden burst of laughter which
spreads contagion among the rest of th'-
audience and in a moment the entire
three hundred inmates are laughing at
nothing.
The performance last evening ras
given under the auspices of the Rev.
William H. Tubbs. It proved to be un
usually attractive and interesting.
One of the greatest events in the his
tory of the institution will take place
next Monday afternoon when Jolly, the
huge elephant from the Chutes me
nagerie, and a number of performing
monkeys and bears will give an exhi
bition on the Almshouse grounds for
the amusement of the inmates.
OLD BELLA UNION
TO BE REOPENED
The Historic Vaudeville Theater
to Take a Fresh
Start.
Carpenters and Refitters Will Have
It Ready in About a
Month.
After a long siege of idleness, during
which rust and general decay have
reigned, the notorious old Bella Union is
about to be reopened. The contractors
decline to say who the new proprietors
are.
A score of carpenters and refltters
were busy on the old place yesterday,
and It Is announced that the resort will
be opened about the middle of next
mont,h as a first-class song and dance
house, with refreshments to suit the
most fastidious tastes. Many fortunes
have been made and lost in the place.
A bit of history not generally known
has just come to light concerning the old
house. It is the fact that there was for
a long time a strong effort to turn the
theater Into a Cmnese resort. Little
Pete negotiated with Ned Foster for its
purchase shortly before Foster sold to
the brewery syndicate. The sale would
have been consummated but for the fact
that the theater and all the property in
the block are owned by the Alfred Borel
banking house. Other tenants refused
to pay their rent if the house was trans
formed into a Chinese theater, so all ef
forts to that end were suspended. For
some weeks the boycott raged quite
fiercely, and the bank gave up all idea
of allowing a deal to be made.
Ed Harrigan. the well known Veda sis
ters, Lotta, Sam Rickey and many other
well known actors got their start at this
famous old vaudeville theater. j
Alice Loy's Betrayer on Trial.
George S. Dugan, a prominent member
of the Army of Jesus Christ, who is ac
cused of having terribly ill-treated Alice
Loy, an S-year-old eirl, was placed on
trial yesterday before a jury In Judge
Wallace's court. The testimony was of
such a revolting character that Judge
Wallace, on motion of counsel engaged
in the case, ordereu all spectators from
the courtroom.
The unfortunate child told her pitiable
story In a manner which carried with it
the conviction of truth.
The trial will be resumed next Monday.
Money for the Orphans.
The Maria Kip Orphanage has come
into possession of $7707, as its share of the
$50,000 left by Senator Fair to the Protest
ant orphan asylums of San Francisco.
The managers of the orphanage are very
grateful to the heirs and their attorneys.
Bishop & Wheeler, Wilson & Wilson,
Lloyd & Wood and Knight & Heggerty
for their kindness in consenting to dis
tribution of the fund, notwithstanding
their contest of the will. This consent
was generously and unhesitatingly given
by the attorneys for the heirs as soon as
suggested to them by Mr. Rixford, at
torney for the orphanage.

I am acquainted with the case of the wife of a house palmer In
Brooklyn, who had the grip, and was confined to the house for three
months. She was in a listless state and suffered terribly with nausea,
. "â â  It so happened that a friend had given some Ripans Tabules to this
lady's sister who had suffered from indigestion, and as they did her so
much good she thought she would try them on Mrs. Hill, feeling sure
- that if they did her no good they would at least do no harm. The
" patient was then in the hands of her physician, but soon she was so
much better that her neighbors noticed the change and asked about
it. She then said that she had ; changed her doctor, and laughingly
i added," my new doctor is colored â color. It seems that as
soon as she began to take the Tabules, she began â to mend. The
nausea disappeared and she began to feel that the fofcasÂ« still had

after the expiration of the time of the
publication of said resolution of inten
tion, which objections shall be d*\K*ered
to the Secretary of the Board of Public
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
to any further proceedings in relation
to the doing of said work or making
said improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition for the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin

first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at
least two-thirds of the property front-
Ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and, in tlie case of a district,
those owning at least two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, shall
make written objections to the
same within said six months, no fur
ther proceedings shall be taken under
the aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work or improvement pro
posed to be done is the construction of
sewers, manholes, culverts or cess

signed by the owners of a maiority of
the frontage or of the district as afore
said, the Board shall, at Its next meet
ing, fix a time for hearing said objec
tions, not less than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
notify the persons making such objec
tions, by depositing a notice thereof in
the Post Office at the City and County,
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
fied the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive;
and if said objections are overruled the
proceedings shall be continued as
though no objections had been made.
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
assessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
of intention, may feel aggrieved, or
who may have objections to any pro
ceedings In relation to the performance
of the work described In said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition of remonstrance, wherein they
shall state In what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and Its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec 5. When the contemplated work
or improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works Is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or Improvement
be made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall in its res
olution of Intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve
ment may be made by any interested
party, in writing, within ten days af
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication of the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before It and the Board
shall, at its next meeting, fix a time
for hearing said objections not less
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons
making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
specified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and j>aÂ«s upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
If the objections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro
vided; and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
âIts decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dia
gram on which shall be delineated each
separate lot, piece or parcel of land,
the area in square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to ths
work or improvement proposed to be
done within the limits of the district.
Such diagram shall be certified to be
correct by the Secretary of the Board.
Sec. 6. When the work under any
contract shall have been completed, the
contractor shall make and file in the
office of the Board of Public Works
an affidavit to the effect that he has
not entered into any private agree
ment, verbal or written, with any per
son liable to be assessed for said work,
or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such
work other than the property owners
who were parties to the agreement, and
shall make void, as to such persons so
defrauded, any assessment made for
the work done under such contract; and
where there is more than one contractor
each contractor shall make such affi
davit.
Sec. 7. When any work In or upon
any public street shall have been com

therefor, together with any incidental
expenses, the rate per front foot as
sessed, the amount of each assessment,

of each lot assessed, and shall have at
tached thereto a diagram exhibiting
the street or street crossing on which
the work has been done, and showing 1
the relative location of each distinct
lot to the work done, numbered to cor
respond with the numbers in the as
sessment, and showing the number of
front feet assessed for said work. A
mistake in the name of the owner shall
not invalidate any assessment.
When the expense of such work falls
in part upon any person, company or
corporation having railroad tracks
upon the street where such work has
been done, said assessment shall In
clude an assessment against said per
son, company or corporation, for its
legal proportion of said expense, and
the same shall constitute a Hen upon
the road-bed, rolling stock, franchises
and other property of such person,
company or corporation, for a period
of two years from the date of record
ing the warrant, assessment and dia
gram hereinafter provided for.

exception is made; but this shall not
be construed so as to affect the special
provisions as to grading contained in
subdivision nine of this section.
Subdivision Eleven â When the reso
lution of intention declares that the
expense of the work and improvement
is to be assessed upon a district, im
mediately after the contractor has ful
filled his contract to the satisfaction
of the Board of Publio Works, or to
the satisfaction of the Supervisors on
appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within
said assessment district, as shown by
the diagram provided for in section five
of this Chapter, the benefits arising
from such work, and to be received

Sec. 10. If at any time there shall be
any street work or Improvement done,
and none of the methods hereinbefore
provided are legally sufficient to au
thorize the Board of Public Works to
make an assessment to pay for the ex
pense thereof, then said Board shall,
before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or Improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments
the Board of Public Works shall act
as a Board, and the assessment ehall
be authenticated by the signatures of
all the members thereof.
Sec. 12. To said assessment shall be

in it, does authorize and empower
(name of contractor) (his or their)
agents, or assigns, to demand and re
ceive the several assessments upon the
assessment and diagram hereto at
tached, and this shall be (his or their)
warrant for the same.
(Date) . (Name of President of
Board of Public Works.)
Countersigned by (Name of Secre
tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment and dia
gram shall be recorded in the office of
the Board. When so recorded the sev
eral amounts assessed shall be a lien
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period of
two years from the date of said record-
Ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record-
Ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons Interested In paid
atjsf iisment shall be deemed to have no
lice <â â¢Â£ the contents of the record
thei eof .
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
bj delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
untii after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
contractor, or his agents or assigns,
Shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having Jurisdiction to render suoh judg
ment, that any suit brought to foraclose
the lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
b/ reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, Irregularity, or ii!e
ga'ily, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any euch assessment, or In the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
in seven months after the entry of said
final Judgment, apply to the Board for
ar- other assessment to be issued in con
formity to law; and the Board shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make an.l deliver to
said applicant a new assessment, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots
of land sot out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final Judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an apDeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each.
If any payment be made, the contrac
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same
upon the assessment in the presence
of the person making such payment,
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be
found or when the owner of the lot is
stated as "unknown" upon the assess
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall publicly demand payment
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty
days after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or
his assigns, or some person on his or
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess
ments remain unpaid in whole or in
part, and the amount thereof. TherÂ«
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff in
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum until paid.

assessment, feeling aggrieved by any
act or determination of the Board of
Public W r orks in relation thereto, or
who claim that the work has not been
performed according to the contract in
a good and substantial manner, or
having or making any objection to the
correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or
proceedings of the Board, shall, within
thirty days after the date of the war
rant, appeal to the Supervisors, by
v-iefiyv -iefiy stating their objections in writ
ing and filing the same with the Clerk

and place of the hearing, briefly re
ferring to the work contracted to be
done, or other subject of appeal, and
to the acts, determinations or proceed
ings objected to or cj-mplained of, shall
be published for five days. Upon such
appeal the Supervisors may remedy
and correct any error or Informality
in the proceedings, and revise and cor
rect any of the acts or determinations
of the Board relative to said work,
may confirm, amend, set aside, alter,
modify or correct the assessment in
such manner as to them shall seem
just; and require the work to be com
pleted according to the directions of
the Supervisors, and may at their op
tion direct the Board of Public Works
to correct the warrant, aHsessment or
diagram In any particular, or to make
and Issue a new warrant, assessment
and diagram to conform to the deci
sions of the Supervisors in relation
thereto.
All the derisions and determinations
of the Supervisors, upon notice and
hearing 1 as aforesaid, shall be final and
conclusive upon all persons entitled to
appeal under the provisions of this
section, as to all errors, informalities
and Irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided;
and no nssessment shall be held in
valid, except upon appeal to the Su
pervisors, as provided in this section,
for any error, informality or other
defect in the proceedings prior to the
assessment, or in the assessment It
self, where the Board of Public Works
has' acquired jurisdiction to make the
same.
Sec. 15. At any time after the period
of thirty-five days from the day of the
date of the warrant, or if an appeal
has been taken to the Supervisors, then,
at any time after five days from the
decision of the Supervisors on such ap
peal, or after the return on the war
rant, after the same may have been
corrected, altered-or modified, as here
in provided, but not less than within
thirty-five days from the date of the
warrant, the contractor or his assignee
may sue in his own name the owner or
the mortgagee of the land, lots, or por
tions of lots assessed on the day of
the date of the recording of the war
rant, assessment and diagram, or any
day thereafter during the continuance
of the lien of said assessment, and re
cover the amount of any assessment
remaining unpaid, with Interest there
on at the rate of seven per centum per
annum until paid.
In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of this Chapter the plain
tiff shall recover the sum of fifteen dol
lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit haa
been brought, after a personal demand
has been made and a refusal to pay
such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery in said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia
gram, with the affidavit of demand and
non-payment, shall be held prima facie
evidence of the regularity and correct
ness of the assessment and of the prior
proceedings and acts of the Board of
Public Works and of the Supervisors
upon which said warrant, assessment
and diagram are based, and like evidence
of the right of the plaintiff to recover in
the action. The Court in which said suit
shall be commenced shall have power
to adjudge and decree a lien against
the lots of land assessed, and to order
such premises to be sold on execution
as in other cases of the sale of real
estate by the process of said Courts.
In all actions brought to enforce the
Hen of assessments made pursuant to
the provisions of this Chapter the pro
ceedings therein shall be governed and
regulated by the provisions of this
Chapter, and, when not in conflict here
with, by the Codes of this State.
Sec. 16. When any portion of thÂ«
roadway of any street, avenue, lane, al
ley, court or place, or any portion of
any sidewalk, in the City and County,

such improvement requires the con
demnation of private property, and the
Board shall by resolution determine
that the improvement would be of pub
lic benefit, it shall make an estimate
of the expense of such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall be
had upon the filing of such petition un
til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

said property â including improvements
thereon â estimating said value accord
ing to the last preceding Assessment
Book of the City and County, shall
present to the Board a petition for said
improvement, verified by their oaths
and describing the lands of which they
are the owners, and showing the
amount at which the same was as
sessed upon the last preceding Assess
ment Book of the City and County, and
stating that they are the owners and
in possession of the lands named in said
petition, the Board shall pass a reso
lution of its intention to recommend
such improvement to the Supervisors,
and shall in such resolution specify a

tention, the Board shall cause to be
prepared a map or diagram of the dis
trict affected by and to be assessed for

tions which may have beÂ°n filed.
Sec. 5. If the Board shall determine
that such objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings

no objections have been filed, or if tha
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, it may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su
pervisors said improvement, and in its
recommendation shall specially report
to the Supervisors whether in its opin

fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.
Sec. 6. If the Board shall pass a

ABTICLE XIX.
i ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC TTTIL
ITIES.
It Is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION L Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision Bhall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
I and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec, 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
j ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisor* must
solicit and consider offers for the <?ala
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors Bhall
have the~benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
j the acquisition of such utility, it shall
I be the duty of the Board to immediate
j ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. Tha
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said petiÂ«
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the forniulation of such proposU
tiona by the Supervisors and the May-,
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the vote 9 cast in favor of fcoth.propositions shall not exoeed one-hall
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall bÂ« deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section Bhall be bo
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same aa
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided.
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and tv
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual Income" and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
m-wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the m-xt regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. Xo question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness Is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner nf voting
for or against incurring such indebted
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections
In the City and County.
Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be'pub
lished daily for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall
cause to be published daily for not less
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election.
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the indebtedness is to be In
curred, the number and character of
the bonds to be issued, the rate of in
terest to be paid, and the amount of
tax levy to be made for the payment
thereof.
Sec. 10. Xo indebtedness Rhall be in
curred for the acquisition of any public
utility under the provisions of this Ar
ticle, which, together with the existing
bonded indebtedness of the City and
County, shall exceed at any one time
fifteen per centum of the assessed value
of all real and personal property in the
City and County.
Sec. 11. The bonds Issued under the
provisions of this Article shall be of the
character of bonds known as serials,

of the United States. The Supervisors

OUR POCKET FILLED FOR WAR,
The financial circular of Henry Clews, the
New York banker, says: "Though standing on i
the very threshold of a great war there Is ,
nothing whatever approaching a panicky feel- j
ing In financial circles. Our responsibilities
have already been carefully weighed; it has
been forecalculated what will be the drain
upon the Treasury and the effect upon our |
foreign trade, and the situation is viewed with j
it full conviction that we are financially well
prepared for whatever may come and can
maintain our ability to keep our business in
terests under compact control and our indus
tries reasonably active when our navy and our
soldiers are engaged In tlie direful activities
of war. It is a significant factâ which
strengthens local confidenceâ that of the hun
dreds of millions of our obligations held abroad
virtually none is being sent home through
distrusts suggested by our situation. On the
contrary, "Americans' rank among the strong
â  Bt securities on the markets of London and
Berlin. Instead of being called upon to return
capital to Europe we are lending largely to
â¢i money markets and gold is still flowing ;
to New York, so miu'h so that the Bank of j
England has during the week had to advance
its rate of discount from 3 per cent to 4 per |
cent in order to check the efflux. Under these j
circumstances the absence of alarm In Wall
street is not surprising, and It seems reason
able to expect that the declaration of war
would not produce any very s-erious further de
cline in the price of investments."

Isuhars. or solid lines, connect points of equal

by clou.!>* weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington When
the pressure Is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north

but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali

In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 14.â There was profes
sional buying of stocks to-day, which gave the
mnrket a firm tone all day. The extreme ad
vance from the low level at the opening was
a. point or over In most of the leading stocks,
but the net gains are less than a point, except
in a few cases. The professional buying was
more or less influenced by the ostentatious es
pousal of the bull side by a large and daring
operator in published utterances and by dis
tribution of buying orders. The following thus
invited was sufficient to effect an advance in
prices of a very narrow market. In spite of
the depressed sentiment reported from the for
eign exchanges. This depression was reflected
at the opening here, but was soon overcome
! by the bull movement. The bears seemed to
i be very active on London exchange, especially
in Spanish 4's, and the fact that they were
forced to cover helped bulls in New York In
later dealers. The bull movement Is based on
the argument that a protracted delay In the
Senate over the intervention resolution is likely
and if the Senate resolution is adopted there
will be a further delay In conference. The
President is credited with having expressed his
preference for the House resolution, and the
bulls profess to believe that if the Senate reso
lution was sent to him it would fail of his
approval. AH of these possible complications
are accepted as furthering the chances of de
lay, and delay to the minds of the bulls means
additional chance for a peaceful settlement A I
large part of the day's activity was centered
In Sugar, the Grangers and Onion Pacific pre
ferred. Prices fell from the highest In the last
hour on the report that the Spanish Minister
was preparing- to leave 'Washington. Rates
for call money eased off 2 per cent this after
noon and only $650,000 of gold waa engaged for
Import.
Business In the bond market was confined
to a few speculative Issues and prices show i
net declines. There waa a sale of a block of

j believe It to be true.

I New York absorbed stocks freely through the

well, consequently prices closed above the

i were also better. Even If war ultimately m
I suits, many here believe that the date of
declaration is some way off. All foreign Btoo'is

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 14. -The Wheat market was
in many respects a peculiar one. Although a
tremendous business was done, most of the
activity was crowded into the half hour imme
diately following the opening and preceding the
close. But in these - brief periods enormous
lines of Wheat .changed hands. The opening
was very strong all around, May again beinc
especially prominent. The continued gravity of
the news from Washington was at all times
a factor. But traders were for the most part
Influenced by the sharp advance which took
place at Liverpool, futures in , that market
showing lVi@2d advances early, and Increasing
them later in the day. . This was apparently
due to apprehension I of hostilities between the
United States and Spain. Another result of
this apprehension, and one which had a great
effect on trading ; here, was the acceptance hv
foreigners 'of everything offered them The
heavy sales of Wheat \ for export yesterday hv
Leiter were â¢ outdone to-day, 1 that trader it at
Ing that he had disposed of 1,100, 000 bushel*
over night at the advance ruling yesterday
The effect on opening prices here was marked
May, which closed yesterday at $1 08U - startpri
to-day at from *1 10 to $1 lO'Â£, and the rush of
buying orders carried the price almost â¢â  imme
diately to $1 11. i At > these figures Leiter sun
plied everybody .! who < wanted : Wheat, ' and . thÂ«
result was a reaction to $1 10 and later to $1 09
but no indication of weakness was shown The
bulk of the trading, however, was done in July
and great nervousness was shown among trad
era In that â " delivery. > Opening prices ranged
from 89c>to 89% c, ran advance of, lVi (fl%c over
yesterday, ; the Influences : governing - May beintr
the factors in ; July also. .-, For half :an hour
trading was extremely heavy, shorts, frightened
at the recent rapid ; advance and the character
of the news, taking everything ; in sight. But
long ' Wheat, which â¢* has : ' been - accumulating
came on â¢ the -; market in -. immense ; quantities'
holders 'being satisfied with their profits, and
under this liquidation â : the 'price was .ham
mered -down .to. SBV4c.' â¢: It â < worked" back again
under * a gradually â¢ decreasing 5 trade Ito .SHVI fd
89% c, ] but there was evidently plenty of Wheat
on tap at around ; 89c, ' and â¢ the price i soon got
under that 'â  fltrure. For :I about ' two ; hours S the
price -swung, back . and j forth, > now i above â¢ 89c
then below. It, w but" the; tendency in the main
toward , a lower level, ; as the â  short interest be
' came eliminated. Short selling In expectation
i of a good reaction finally started, and half -an
I hour from the close the selling movement had
I become . general, â¢ many :of â : the early - buyers
i offering their lines. The result was a decidedly
â  i weak market for a short space of time, not
: only the early advance, but a little beside.. â â  It
I looked as if â  the market would wind up I with
the advantage with the bears, but shortly be
fore the close Leiter brokers started ' to : bull
the May : price. They were eminently uuc-
I cessful and a new high mark, $1 11%, was

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Another advance In Hay is noted. The sharp
rise in this article, coupled with the fear that
the State will not raise enough this year to
carry it through, has led dealers to look about
on all sides for su nlies. The result 1b that
Alfalfa is on its way from Utah, and can be
landed here at $15 per ton. From Oregon Tim
othy is coming at $16. and it is reported that
a common kind of Hay can be landed here
from Ariaon at $12. The local trade do nut
yet know what effect these shipments from
abroad will have on the market, as it is not
known how much hay these three new sources
of supply have for sale. This outside Hay
will be on the market shortly, and then some
idea of how it will figure may be obtained.

ROBBED OF
HER MONEY
AND WATCH
Bold Crime of Two
Supposed Ex-Mes
senger Boys.
Mrs. Wagman, a Guest
at Hackmeier's Hotel,
the Victim.
Induced to Leave Her Apart
ments She Is Relieved of
a Large Sum.
SEARCHING FOR THIEVES.
As They Are Known the Detectives
Expect lo Arrest Them
Soon.
The police are searching for two ex
messenger boys, who cleverly robbed
Mrs. Wagman, a guest at Hack
meier's Hotel, Wednesday afternoon.
Shortly after noon the bold thieves vis
ited the hotel, and pretended to be in
search of employment.
While one of them engaged the clerk
In conversation the other went to Mrs.
Wagman's room and informed her that
a friend named Moore was waiting to
see her in the reception room. Not sus
pecting anything wrong the woman left
her room, expecting to meet some
friend whom she had known In the
East. To her surprise she found the
reception room unoccupied, and think
ing that the boy had played a Joke on
her, she leisurely returned to her room.
After completing her toilet, prepara
tory to taking a trip to the park she
went to get her purse containing JIRO
which she had left on the table. The
money was gone, as well as a gold
watch, which Mrs. Wagman prized
very highly. Realizing that the boy
had robbed her the surprised woman at
once informed the clerk who sent for
a police officer. The latter after get
ting a description of the two boys re
ported the facts to Chief Lees. He de
tailed Detectives Dinan and Reynolds
to make an investigation, but despite
their efforts the boys have thus far
managed to elude arrest.
Last night Mrs. Wagman visited po
lice headquarters and told the story of
the robbery. She said she arrived here
from Indianapolis and went to Hack
meier's Hotel. She intended to make
a short stay, and then return to her
home.
"On the day of the bold robbery." she
remarked, "I had placed my purse con
taining nearly all the money I had on
the table in my room. As a precaution
ary measure, so as not to excite the
cupidity of any stranger who hap
pened to enter the house. I placed my
hat over the purse. While I was ar
ranging my toilet I heard a knock at
the door, and on opening it I found a
young man who wore a cap similar to
the ones used by messenger boys. He
informed me that a friend was waiting
for me in the reception room and that
he was anxious to see me. Without
waiting to lock the door of my apart
ments, I went to the reception room and
was considerably surprised on not find
ing any one there.
"I then returned to my room and
discovered that I had been robbed."
The police are satisfied that the boys
had carefully planned the robbery and
that they were aware of the fact that
Mrs. Wapman had considerable money
In her possession.

BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL.
Work Fairly Good and Only Two
Non-Union Jobs Reported.
The reports from the delegates of the
various trades at the Building Trades
Council last night were of a very encour
aging nature. Work is considered to be
fairly good, and the working card of the
council is being recognized everywhere.
The committee which was to have met
with the committees on Health and Police
of the Supervisors to explain the import
of a sanitary Ijill reported that the
Health and Police Committee had been
unable to secure a quorum at the time
arranged, and efforts will be made to
meet again in the near future.
A meeting of the Joint committee of the
three central bodies having the Kelso
case in charge will be held at 1159 Mission
street to-night. Another meeting to dis
cuss the new charter will be held at 915%
Market street Sunday afternoon.
Democratic Henchmen Organize.
A large delegation of Democratic voters
of the Thirtieth Assembly District met at
997 Market street last night for the pur
pose of organizing a district club. About
200 men signed the roll. This, in addition
to those having previously, presented
themselves for membership through the
medium of Colonel J. F. Sullivan, will
bring the number up to about 600. James
Farrell was elected president, J. P.
Sweeney; vice-president, James F. Cree-
gan secretary, Edward Lunny treasurer

A MISSION BURGLAR CAUGHT.
John Quinn's Visit to the Residence
of Mrs. Johnson Lands Him.
in Jail.
John Qulnn. a seedy looking tramp,
was arrested by Officer C. M. Shore In
the Mission last night on the charge of
burglary. Quinn entered the residence
of Mrs. Johnson at 4 Collingswood street
and proceeded to rifle the house in the
most approved fashion. He went up
stairs and turned over the bedclothes on
the beds, throwing them on the floor in
his search for valuables. Not finding
money or jewelry he packed up some
wearing apparel and carried the bundle
to the front door, where he left it while
he proceeded to explore the dining room
and kitchen. Here he was confronted by
the lady of the house, who inquired his
business. He tried to run a bluff by ask
ing for something to eat. He was in
formed that was not the way to enter
the house; that he should have rung the
bell and waited for the door to be opened.
At this he left, but the suspicious manner
in which he acted caused Mrs.. Johnson
to make an examination of her premises
and on going upstairs she found that
Quinn had been there.
She gave the alarm and Officer Shore
responded and succeeded in capturing
the burglar within a short distance of the
place. â¢â _â¢
WAS OUT TO KILL.
A Highbinder Arrested While He
Was Looking for an Enemy.
While out looking for an enemy whom
he wished to kill, Yee King, a Chinese
highbinder, was arrested last evening and
charged with carrying concealed weap
ons. He had In his possession a fourteen
lnch knife and a 44-caliber navy revolver.
A woman in one of the disreputable
houses had some trouble with a man
several days ago, and Yee Ning, being a
friend of the woman, took up the quar
rel and determined to kill her enemy.
ThP officers were on the lookout for lee
Ning and he was seen early in the even
ing by Officer Handley of Sergeant Shea s
squad, but the nimble highbinder disap
peared before he could be captured.
Later, as Policeman Silver was walking
down Clay street, near Spofford alley, he
saw the "Chinese coming toward him.
Tee Ning spied the officer at the same
time and ran into a lodging-house, where
Silver captured him.

saulting E. Liebscher, a grocer, at Ma
son and Pacific streets, are well known
to the police. Thorn is an ex-convict and
is known as a desperate character. The
accomplice is a graduate of the "Whittier
Reform School, and is regarded as a con
firmed criminal.
As told in yesterday's Call, the two
men entered Liebscher's store and after
severely beating him got away with $117
In money and two watches. Although
partially dazed from the beating he re
ceived, Liebscher grabbed a revolver
which was lying under the counter and
started after the fleeing robbers. He fired
five shots at them, which had the effect
of attracting Policemen Peshon, Conners
and Conway to the scene. After a short
chase they succeeded in capturing the
desperadoes.
A short time afterward the same offi
cers also arrested a young man named
George Baker and charged him with be
ing a party to the crime.
He was found in a lodging house on
Kearny street, and despite his protesta
tion of innocence he was taken to the
City Prison, where his name was regis
tered on the "small book." Thorn and
"Winrow were positively identified by
their victim. The former's true name is
Joe Theron. To the criminal classes he
Is known as the "Tough Frenchman."
Thorn or Theron is the man who assist
ed Murderer Bruggy to escape from the
Santa Rosa jail. He was arrested after
an exciting chase, and on a conviction
was sent to San Quentin for five years.

lishment. It is more than probable that
some one who had studied the surround
ings carefully committed the crime, as
it was plainly seen that articles of small
value were not disturbed and nothing was
broken while the selections were being
made.
In one of the show windows nothing
was taken but a piano lamp, and just how
the party or parties reached the piece of
furniture without knocking everything
down in the window is a matter wor
thy of thought. The choicest pieces be-
longing to valuable sets, including pretty
cups and saucers, coffee pots and prize
bowls, were carried away, and it is esti
mated that the loss will reach $900.

cape he served one year in the House of
Correction for grand larceny.
During the past few months sev Â« ra ]
grocery store proprietors nave been held
up by two masked robbers, and it is now
believed that Thorn was one of them.
The description tallies exactly with that
of the "stout robber" who a short time
ago entered a grocery-store on Minna
street and at the point of a pistol com
pelled the proprietor and several custom
ers to throw up their hands. While he
held them in submission his confederate,
who was also masked, emptied the cash
register, which contained a few dollars.
He also relieved one of the patrons of a
gold watch and a small amount of money.
Chief L*es is greatly pleased over the
capture of the two men, and at the next
meeting of the Police Commissioners he
will ask that the officers who participated
in the arrest be granted a few days Ij^ve
of absence in recognition of their services.
CROCKER LODGE ENTERTAINS.
It Furnishes Music and Song to Its
Many Friends In Mission
Parlor Hall.
Crocker Lodge No. 302 of the Ancient
Order of United Workmen, composed of
men in the employ of the street railway
companies and the Market-street Rail
way Band, gave an entertainment and
ball last night in Mission Parlor Hall.
The hall, which was decorated with rare
good taste, was filled to its capacity by
members of both organizations and their
friends. They were treated to a pro
gramme of vocal and instrumental music
that has seldom been excelled at any
entertainment given by fraternal bodies.
The band, under tho directorship of
Will H. Ramsey, rendered "Under the
Double Eagle," "Forrest Park" and "Am
bolena Snow"; Kathrine and Marian
Clarke entertained with violin and piano
duet; J. Kennedy gave selections on the
cornet; Sam Booth, grand receiver of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen, kept
the audience in a roar of laughter with
original songs; Miss Ada J. Wheaton gave
"The Battle of Prague" on the piano,
with bugle accompaniment, aud her per
formance, a very creditable one, was
loudly applauded; Will H. Ramsey pro
voked a. great deal of mirth by singing
"Because the Cars Th<=-y Run So Slow,
a skit on the recent order of the Mayor
reducing the speed of street cars. Then
followed instrumental selections on piano
and violin by Olive, Blanche and Ruben
Theil; vocal solo by William Crews, bary
tone; piano solo by Miss Alice Bell and
Professor H. C. Seib; popular songs by
Mr. Edwards; cornet solo by Miss Whea
ton, who rendered in a most enchanting
manner "Have I But Thy Love" and "Far
From You, Far-famed, Immortal Hills"
(opera of "Attilla"). After that followed
dancing until midnight.
The committee of arrangements was:
S. M. Snyder, F. T. Morne, H. Barron, H.
J. McClintock, W. A. Ramsey and S. An
derson.
Christian Endeavor Concert.
The excellent programme presented by
the Young People's Society of Christian
Endeavor at St. John's Presbyterian
Church last night drew to that edifice a
large number of the friends of the so
ciety, who were well rewarded by the
select programme rendered. After the
conclusion of the concert the participants
were entertained at a banquet by the
members of the society. The following
soloists took part in the concert: Charles
Parent, basso; Clarence Wendell, tenor;
Mrs. Eva Tenney, soprano; Mrs. Olive
Reed-Cushman. contralto, and Arthur F.
Johannsen, violin. F. Dellepiane, accom
panist.
Candy Makers Will Dance.
The Candy Makers' Club of San Fran
cisco will give its fourth annual ball and
bonbon party at Union-square Hall next
Saturday night. One of the features of
the evening will be the free distribution
of candy to all who may attend. Excel
lent music has been secured for the oc
casion, and the committee having the
affair In charge has made every effort to
Insure an enjoyable time to every one.
The watchman, Armiger, says he visited
the store about that time and everything
was in its usual place, but when he re
turned some time later the store was In a
state of disorder. The owners of the
place are of the opinion that some one
has paid for the burglary for the purpose
of taking the valuable articles out of the
country for exhibition purposes, but the
police think the articles will easily be re
covered. The largest article taken was
a chrysanthemum table top, valued at
$150.
A French coffee pot which had been on
exhibition at the World's Fair and which
was estimated to be worth about $75 was
also missing. The most peculiar part of
the burglary, according to the police, is
the fact that the money drawer was not
disturbed. A strong effort will be made
by Detective Whitaker, who has been de
tailed on the case, to find the property,
which may result In a detection of the
much-wanted thieve*
BURNED LIKE
A BEACON ON
THE BEACH
Fire Destroys Golden
Gate Villa, Ha.g
gerty's Place.
It Was a Well- Known
Resort for Park and
Ocean Frequenters.
Lack of Hydrant Facilities Pre
vented Effective Work by
the Firemen.
WAS A BRILLIANT BLAZE.
It Started In the Kitchen and the
Inmates Had to Hurry to
Escape.
Golden Gate Villa, one of the pret
tiest resorts on the ocean beach, was
destroyed by fire last night. The place
was owned and conducted hy Robert
Haggerty and Charles Leonhardt, and
scarcely a vestige of it was left at mid
night, whon the fire engines were called
away from the scene. The firemen
could do Httle to save the buildings and
their contents. The nearest fire hy
drant was 1400 feet away, and there
was only one of them in the district
that could be reached by a hose line.
From that only a feeble stream could
be got and about all the firemen could
do was to stand and watch the place
burn.
It made a brilliant blaze. The build
ings were of light "ginger bread" work
and burned readily. The flames could
be seen from the city above the tops
of the hills that skirt the ocean beach,
and at the Cliff House, a half-mile
awr- it dimmed the electric lights.
All that was saved from the place
was a few of the bar fixtures and they
were not estimated to be worth more
than $50. The proprietors of the place
estimate their building and contents to
be worth about $25,000, and the insur
ance companies representatives place
the loss at only $3000 below their fig
ures. The insurance on the property
was $20,000.
The fire started In the kitchen. It
was first observed by John Mrilahan,
the trainer of James Lawler, the pugi
list, who is preparing for a fight with
Charles Conway at the Olympic Club
on next Friday night. He gave the
alarm, and the occupants of the place
had hardly time to escape with' their
lives. Lawler was asleep in his room,
and when he was aroused the flames
were at the door of his apartment. He
was obliged to leap from the w r indow
only partially dressed. He left his
watch and two r diamond rings behind,
as well as his training apparatus.
Charles Spohn, the bartender of the
saloon, occupied a room near that of
Lawier, and he, too, was obliged to
jump for his life. He saved scarcely
any of his effects. Heggerty was on
watch in the bar of the house and as
soon as the alarm was given and it
was seen that the flames had such a
great start, he occupied his time in re
moving what he could from the bar,
but it was not long before he was
driven away, so rapidly did the fire
spread, and he saved but little of the
stock of liquors.
In the rear of the main building were
many sheds, and it was not long be
fore they were enveloped In flames.
One of a pair of horses was gotten
safely out of one of the sheds, but the
other was caught by the fire and
burned to death.
About a hundred feet to the south of
where the burned buildings stood is the
Golden Gate Life-saving Station, but
by the work of the crew of the place,
with their feeble fire-fighting appr-atus
and the formation of a bucket brigade
among their number, the buildings
were kept wet and the fire was pre
vented from spreading to them. A
short distance to the east is a large
three-story building recently erected by
Adolph Sutro, but as yet unoccupied.
It was in a direct line with the sparks
that were carried by the high wind,
but the firemen united their efforts in
protecting it when it was seen that
nothing could be saved from the burn
ing structures, and though the fire
brands lodged several times in its roof
it was saved from the flames.
HEAVYWEIGHT PUGILISTS.
Ftelzner and Baker Will Box Ten
Bounds Before the National Club.
The National Athletic Club will match
Henry Baker and Jack Stelzner to-day to
box ten rounds ,on the evening of May 6,
as a preliminary to the Jeffries and Shar
key twenty-round contest. In the pool
rooms even money is being wagered on
the big fellows, and already a large
amount of gold coin has changed hands.
There is very little gambling on the Jef
fries and Mexican Pete fight, which will
be held In the Olympic Club. There is
no end of Jeffries money in sight, and at
the prevailing odds of $10 to $4, with Pete
on the short end, there is very little
"Mexican" money to be had.
Kennedy, the pugilist who is at pres
ent boxing with Mexican Pete, will leave
for Vallejo on Monday to act as sparring
partner to Sharkey, and Jack Stelzner
will Journey to Oakland to-day, wnere
he will be taken in hand by Billy De
lanev. Stelzner will assist Jeffries to put
on the finishing touches for the big mill
