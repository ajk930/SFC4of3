The platform, which is an expression of
the principles represented by the party's
candidates for office, was adopted by the
Republican Municipal Convention last
evening. The document is a strong one,
and is in keeping with the great care that
Is being exercised in the selection of men
to whom will be intrusted the work of
carrying out its provisions.
The work of making nominations was
also continued from the point where the
convention left off Wednesday evening.
The business wont forward smoothly and
rapidly, and nothing occurred to mar the
harmony that has marked the work of
the convention since its initial session.
The Legislative, Judicial and educational
convention completed its labors, and it
is now believed that at y>-nlght's session
the entire municipal ticket will have been
completed.
The nominations made by the municipal
convention last night were William A.
Deane for County Clerk, Henry s Martin
for Sheriff, Martin F. Fragley for Su
perintendent of Streets, D. J. Murphy for
District Attorney, and Edward I. Shee
han for Tax Collector. The selection ot
each name was the signal for much ap
plause and many cheers, as each one of
the candidates Is well known and popular.
All appeared before the convention and
thanked the assembled delegates for the
honor that had been bestowed upon them.
They each indorsed the platform, and
briefly promised, if elected, to carry out
its provision in the spirit as well as in
the letter.
Following the calling of the convention
to order by Chairman Allen, J. M. Chre
tien, chairman of the committee on plat
form and resolutions, announced that the
committee was ready to present Its re
port. The platform, which is printed in
full In another column of this paper, is
of considerable length and was read by
The San Francisco Call
Mr. Chretien. On motion it was adopted
as read.
Chairman Allen announced that Charles
L. Patton, the Republican nominee for
Mayor, was unable to be present at the
meeting of the convention last evening,
but- had authorized the statement that
purpose of addressing the convention rel
ative to his acceptance of the platform
and the nomination which has been ten
dered him. Chairman Allen then an
nounced that the next business before
the convention was the selection of a
candidate for County Clerk. O. C. Pratt
of the Thirty-second Assembly District
ascended the platform for the purpose of
presenting to the convention the name of
William A. Deane. He said:
"Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the con
vention and fellow citizens: Two years
ago at an election held In this city and
county a gentleman ran for the office of
Auditor, pitted against whom was a reg
ular Democratic nominee and a Republi
can nominee running on a sidetrack
ticket. That Republican nominee ob
tained 30,000 votes â a few hundred
votes less than the Democratic nominee,
the Republican sideshow nominee having
obtained but 4000 votes. He is a man who
is enthused and inspired by thoughts
which come to him when he realizes that
the genius of William McKlnley has led
the Republican party up to the achieve
ments of to-day. That the same courage,
the same wisdom our President has dis-
played during his administration has been
so marked that there is not an American
citizen to-day so humble, so lowly or lost
that he falls to recognize in our standard
bearer one of the noblest works of God.
(Applause.)
"At the present time he is occupying
the position of chief deputy in the office
of the County Clerk of the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, and has performed
so well his duty that he has maintained
the universal commendation of all people,
irrespective of class or party. Gentle
men, in placing before you the name of
William A. Deane (great applause) I
mention a name that will add force and
glory to the victory that shall be won on
the Bth of November." (Applause.)
The nomination of Mr. Deane was sec
onded by W. W. Allen. There being no
further nomination a motion was made
and carried instructing the secretary to
cast the ballot for Mr. Deane aÂ» the
nominee of the convention for the office
of County Clerk. Mr. Deane said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I indorse your platform and
I thank you for the confidence you have
placed in me." (Applause.)
Nominations for a candidate for Sher
iff being next in order ex-State Senator
P. C. Maher presented to the convention
the name of Henry S. Martin. A great
burst of applause greeted the mention of
the candidate's name and the demonstra
tion was taken as a striking evidence of
his popularity. Mr. Maher said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I have in my mind's eye an
ideal candidate for the office of Sheriff of
the city and county of San Francisco. He
has been a long time a resident of this
city and county. He arrived here some
thirty-nine years ago and has held a con
tinuous residence here all that time. He
was received on that occasion by an old
pioneer who happened to be his father;
surrounded by a great many friends who
welcomed him to San Francisco. He has
been making friends ever since and to-day
he has them numbered by the thousands
in this city and by the hundreds in this
convention. If you nominate him there
will not be a person in this large city who
will net rejoice.
"My friends, not alone will this nomi
nation please the residents of this city, but
it will please the residents of every coun
ty of the State where the Native Sons
have held their Grand Parlor â pleased
that the grand treasurer of the Native
Sons has been awarded the nomination
of Sheriff by the Republican party in
San Francisco. (Great cheering and ap
plause.)
"It is unnecessary for me, I see, to
mention his name, but to have It go
down on the records properly I say it is
Henry S. Martin. (Cheers and applause.)
"He is a gentleman possessed of execu
tive ability.. He is a man of means and
one of our heaviest taxpayers. (Laugh
ter.) I readily see that we have a num
ber of taxpayers hereâ ho is one of them.
If elected, he will see that the office is
run economically and to the best interests
of the people. Nominate him and you
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1898.
will go home feeling happy that you
have nominated a man as good as those
you have already named for high offices.
Give him this nomination and he will win
as sure as there is night and day. Each
and every Republican citizen will rejoice
In his nomination, as he richly deserves
the place. " (Great cheering.)
The nomination of Mr. Martin was sec
onued by E. S. Salomon. There being no
other nominations the secretary was In
structed to cast the ballot for Mr. Mar
tin. The candidate appeared on the plat
form and thanked the convention for the
nomination and signified his acceptance
of the platform. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I sincerely thank you from
the bottom of my heart for the great
honor you have conferred upon me by
nominating me for the office of Sheriff.
If the people will elect meâ if elected by
the people, I will discharge the duties of
that high and important office to the best
of my ability. I thank you again, gentle
men, sincerely." (Applause.)
The next order of business was the se
lection ol a candidate for the office of
Superintendent of Streets. Judge J. C.
Daly placed Martin F. Fragley in nomi
nation. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: There Is nothing that shows
more clearly the character of a city to
strangers than Its streets and parks, and
nothing is so critically Judged by such
visitors. In our platform we have pledged
our candidates to aid In the progress of
this city. Great stress has been placed
on the improvement "t" â¢ â¢\>r Ptreota al"'a 1 "'
highways, low, gentlemen, for the of
fice of Superintendent of Streets I have
in view a representative of the Republi
can party, a man who will support -Â»c
platform, a man who will not sit in his
office, but will go out on the highways
and see that the streets are built and that
the contracts are carried out, and to per
form that duty he must have experience.
He must know a street when it is fin
ished.
"Taking that view, gentlemen, I am
going to present the name of a man who
is In every way qualified to fill the office
of Superintendent of Streets. He is a
man whose name has never been brought
in question. He is not a stranger In San
Francisco. Although not having held an
elective office, he has won the admiration
and confidence of the men who employed
him and those with whom he dealt. He
has held office as Superintendent of the
House of Correction (applause), and when
he accepted that office he found that the
institution was $5000 in debt by reason of
the administration of his predecessor.
But out of the appropriation he paid off
the debt by the introduction of economic
measures. By the introduction of disci
pline he brought about numerous im
provements. After a faithful administra
tion he was able to leave $3000 m the
treasury.
"Now, gentlemen, there is no office more
important, and I ask you to nominate this
gentleman because he will execute the
duties of this office so that it will be a
credit to the city. Four years to come
the people will look back to the adminis
tration of Martin F. Fragley. (Applause
and cheers.) I see j'ou are going to nom
inate him and his election will follow as
a natural consequence." (Applause.)
The nomination was seconded by A.
Ruef. There being no further nomina
tions the secretary was instructed to cast
the ballot for Mr. Fragley. He was es
corted to the platform and said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I indorse your platform
heartily and if elected to the position of
Superintendent of Streets I guarantee to
do my duty faithfully." (Applause.)
Nominations for a candidate for District
Attorney were next in order and A. P. Van
Duzer named ex-Superior Judge D. J.
Murphy for the position. He paid a glow
ing tribute to Judge Murphy's record as a
public officer and declared that his nom
ination at the hands of the convention
could be considered as equivalent to an
election. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: My native modesty would not
have allowed me to appear before you
this evening if it had not been requested
of me that I should nominate a man from
the Mission for an office, and as I live at
the Mission I never go back on a man
who lives at the Mission. (Applause.)
And particularly when he lives in the
warm belt. The office of District Attor
ney, in my opinion, stands first in the
municipal government. There is no ques
tion whatever that so far as the welfare
of this great city is concerned that office
should be filled by a man who possesses
a fiber of steel and a brain as quick as a
rapid-fire gun. We have been looking: for
a man of that quality and have found
many. I read the other day that the cen
tral principle of all municipal govern
ments was to place in office men who
have been tried and found to be true. The
one I have the honor to place In nomina
tion Is such a man. It was in 1853 he came
to California. In 1870 the people of this
city made him District Attorney. That
they were satisfied with his labors was
shown at the next election when they
elected him again, because the people
knew that If a man was giiilty of larceny
he would be convicted and If a man waa
guilty of murder he would be hanged, and,
I am in favor of hanging, as it has a di
rect tendency to reduce Democratic ma
jorities. (Laughter and prolonged ap
plause.)
"The gentleman after he had served
four years as District Attorney was pro
moted to the bench. During six years
the white light of the public press was
thrown upon him. They could find noth
ing against him. He was re-elected to
serve six years more. He has had the
distinction of trying the most important
criminal case in the annals of this coun
try, and it may be said to his credit that
when the voluminous transcript had been
made and filed in the Supreme Court, the
Judges of that distinguished body were
unable to find one mistake that had been
made by the Judge. You know who he
is. His name is D. J. Murphy. (Tremen
dous applause.) I present him to you for
the office of District Attorney, He needs
nothing further than merely to name
him. I want to simply say this: That all
sorts of fights will be made against him,
but I don't consider that there will be a
Democrat in the Mission that will not
vote for him. They know him, and they
say he Is the man for that place."
There being no other candidate for the
nomination, Judge Murphy waa made the
nominee of the convention by acclama
tion. He was escorted to the platform,
and spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I would be devoid of feeling:
and have a cold heart If I did not feel
grateful for your kindness to me to
night. There are many gentlemen here
In this convention whom I have known
for many years and with whom I have
had personal and social relations. There
are present before me my neighbors with
whom and beside whom I have lived for
years, and to receive this kind treatment
at your hands and at their hands I must
say causes a grateful emotion In my
heart.
"The position to which you have nomi
nated me Is one of the most Important
In this city and county. I am not a
novice as to the duties of that office. As
you have been Informed I have had the
honor of filling it for three full terms.
It has great responsibilities connected
with it and the man who assumes the
office must assume the responsibilities.
He must be kind and firm; know
no class and no caste; recognize
the poor man and treat him the same
as the richest and proudest in the land.
(Great applause.) And such, gentlemen,
will be the treatment of any and all the
citizens of this city sfiould I be elected
to this office. Tour platform I have
heard and Indorse in its entirety. I have
been a Republican for many years. I
believe the prosperity of the country is
due to the enforcement of the principles
of the Republican party. And I believe
that Gage and Neff and the entire State
ticket and this ticket you have nomi
nated must of necessity, if the citizens
of this State understand their duties and
perform them, be triumphantly elected.
"Now, without desiring to take up your
further time, I can return you my sin
cere thanks, and if elected will perform
my duties as completely, as truthfully
and as honestly as It Is within my power
to do." (Applause.)
Ex-Assemblyman Frank H. Powers was
the next speaker to address the conven
tion. He did so for the purpose of plac
ing the najne of Edward I. Sheehan in
nomination for the office of Tax Collec
tor. He said:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: Probably the most import
ant position of any place Is the man who
handles the dough. (Laughter.) In this
city the Tax Collector Is the means
whereby the oil which makes the machin
ery work Is secured. Such a man must be
able to fill the position because of his
capacity as a business man, because of
his accuracy as a bookkeeper, and be
cause of his integrity as an honest citi
zen. We have nominated a ticket which
will soon be elected, taking representa
tives from every branch or the civil life
that we represent. We have lawyers,
bankers, merchants and worklngmen,
and now I wish to present to you one of
the residents of the lower Mission, a man
who has worked himself up from the
shoemaker's bench. I name Edward I.
Sheehan for Tax Collector." (Applause
and cheers.)
There being no other nominations for
the position Mr. Sheehan was declared
the nominee of the convention by accla
mation. He was escorted to the platform
and spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
convention: I return you my hearty
thanks for this compliment. I indorse
your platform, and if elected to the posi
tion of Tax Collector I will carry out the
duties of that office In a way that will re
flect credit on the Republican party."
(Applause.)
Qn motion of J. M. Chretien the con
vention adjourned to meet at Odd Fel
lows' Hall this evening at 8 o'clock.
COmPLETES
ITS DUTIES
Close of the Legislative,
Judicial and Educational
Convention,
With cheers for the standard bearers of
their party, the delegates to the Republi
can legislative, judicial and educational
convention concluded their labors at an
early hour last evening and adjourned.
The convention completed its work by
nominating twelve School Directors and
by filling the legislative ticket. The hour
set for the opening of the convention was
7 o'clock, but it was three-quarters of an
hour later before the delegates were in
their places and chairman E. I. Wolfe
called them to order.
The chairman announced that the com
mittee of five to whom was referred the
selection of twelve candidates for School
Directors was made up of the following
delegates: Richard D. Faulkner, chair
man; E. W. Williams, T. P. ONell,
Charles Mayers and Bernard Lemmon.
The : platform upon which " the nominees ',
of â  the- convention * will-, base , their i claims \
upon * the ; suffrages of ,'. the; 1 people at : the.
forthcoming election was then : read Jby R.
I D. Faulkner. /.The reading was punctuat
;â¢ ed ;by applause ; as . the ' strong : planks ;in
the instrument were set forth. Upon mo-
Won Â«jt Delegate Ojijif oyie^t '.was" received
<mi H<ioi>ioÂ«l as t:nj platform ol : the con
vention. Delegate Morgenstern proposed
a vote .of thanks | to ; the committee j for its
able efforts I in Â» framing the platform. ; i
Mr.' Faulkner again took the center, of
the stage, this time to read the report of
the special committee which selected
twelve School â  Directors from 167 ' names
submitted. He prefaced 1 the report with
some remarks, ' saying, / among -other
i things, that if the schools of the county
are lacking in any qualities it is the fault
of the â they, should pay more at
tention to that branch of the government.
The report follows:
. SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29, IR9B.
- To the Officers and Members of the Repub
lican Judicial, â  Educational ': and ' - Legislative
Convention â Gentlemen: â â¢; In accordance with 'a
motion duly passed by your honorable body at
its regular, meeting - held :on Wednesday even-
Ing, - September 28, 1898, - the undersigned ' were
appointed â¢ a committee ,of five to report and
recommend ,to your honorable body the names
of twelve candidates for the office of School
Director, to be . submitted for your â¢ considera
tion out of the names â  suggested and handed in
to the secretary by the delegates of this â  con
vention. I Your committee would respectfully re
port : that - after their, appointment .; by the
chairman ' of ", this convention they duly
considered the' names and qualifications of all
candidates for f the office of . School ' Director â
167 in - numberâ and â ' after . such consideration
they beg .to report i that out of the multitude
of gentlemen eminently qualified to fill the po
sition they have considered it -advisable- and
! expedient , to suggest to the > conventifn v. the
names of the * following, twelve to be elected
as the nominees of the Republican : party, for
the office of School Director: J. B. ; Cole, Ed
L. Head. William â > Kemp, f John . Conlon. 1. M.
Thomas, Vanderlynn i Stow, 'H. .; M. " Holbrook,
Dr. 'â  Josef 'I. - Maftson, â  G. ; E. Armstrong,' ; Dr.
E. H. Gedge, P. <A. : Bergerot and William ; O.
Stafford. â  . â¢
The attention of the delegates was then
called to the fact that on the previous
evening they neglected to nominate a
candidate for the unexpired term of
Police Judge. A. B. Treadwell was placed
in nomination and was elected unani
mously.
Delegate Faulkner said the same lapse
had occurred in the matter of School Di
rector, the delegates having overlooked
the naming of a person to till the unex
pired term of the late Director Halstead.
J. B. Cole was nominated, and there be
ing no opposition he was elected.
The various delegations were then heard
from in the matter of nominations for
Assemblymen, where they had not been
announced on the previous evening. When
the Twenty-eighth District representatives
were called upon to name their Assembly
man, Chairman J. E. Durnin announced
that they had been unable to agree upon
a candidate. The fact of an office going
begging amused those present. The laugh
turned into a roar of laughter as Counsel
or Becsy hastily made his way to the
place where the Twenty-eighth District
delegates were seated. His advice was ap
parently not desired as he was greeted
coldly and made his way to his seat in
a crestfallen manner.
The list of Senators and Assemblymen
was completed by the addition of John
A. Hoey in the Eighteenth Senatorial and
by adding L. A. Devoto In the Thirtieth
Assembly: P. F. Sullivan in the Thirty
second; Robert McCullough in the Thir
ty-third; J. G. Boobar in the Thirty-sev
enth and Leon E. Jones in the Thirty
ninth. The nominees for these offices then
indorsed the platform. No oratory was
permitted, the men being restricted to
the plain statement that they indorsed the
platform.
Fred Lees Introduced a resolution to the
effect that the present Republican County
Committee of this city and county be em
powered to fill all vacancies that may oc
cur between now and the election, either
by withdrawal, death or otherwise.
Gaston Straus presented a resolution
that Harry N. Gray. P. H. Prendergast
A. Ruef, M. L. Asher and C. A. Went
worth be appointed the auditing commit
tee of the convention and of all the Legis
lative, Assembly and Senatorial districts
thereof, with all the poivers and duties
vested in such committee under the pro
viÃions of the purity of elections law.
Chairman E. I. Wolfe, Vice-Chairman
Burdette. Secretary Casey and his assist
ants were voted the thanks of the dele
gates for their work, whereupon the con
vention adjourned sine die.
Building trades Council.
At a meeting of the Building Trades'
Council last evening resolutions were
passed condemnatory of an organization
known as the "United Labor party,"
which was characterized as being com
posed of representatives of "nothing but
vagrancy, indolence and fraud," and noti
fying all candidates who accept a nom
ination at the hands of this party that
they "will be held responsible for trying
to deceive labor by purchasing its name
upon the ballot." The candidacy of La
bor Commissioner Fitzgerald for. Public
Administrator was Indorsed.
FITTING END
OF GAGE'S
FIRST TOUR
Tremendous Ovation to
the Standard-Bearer
at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29. â The series of mass-meetings
held in the counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernar
dino, San Diego, Orange and Riverside under the auspices of the
Republican State Central Committee closed in Los Angeles to
night with one of the greatest political demonstrations ever wit
nessed in the chief city of Southern California.
Never in the history of California has there been such an
awakening among the masses during a gubernatorial campaign.
A vast multitude assembled at each speaking point to cheer the
standard-bearer, Henry T. Gage, with assurances of victory and
to respond to the eloquent utterances of General Barnes with
tumultuous applause. The success of the tour in calling together
great masses of the voting population inspires the Republicans
with courage for renewed work in behalf of the cause.
Shortly before noon to-day Gage and Barnes arrived in Los
Angeles from Riverside. They were met at the depot by Brad
ner W. Lee of the County Central Committee, Judge McKinley
of the campaign committee and other representative Republi
cans, and escorted to the Van Nuys and Hollenbeck, respec
tively.
At the Hollenbeck Hotel, from 3 until 5 o'clock in the
afternoon, Mr. Gage received an immense number of callers.
The same spirit of enthusiasm manifested at other leading 1
points in the southern part of the State was displayed here. It
was noted here, as elsewhere, that the enthusiasm proceeded
from the people, as distinguished from the politicians.
To gratify an almost universal desire in Los Angeles to
hear General Barnes at length, Mr. Gage decided in the after
noon to abridge his own speech and give his brilliant associate
from San Francisco ample opportunity for discourse. In order
to afford the people of the city a chance to hear General Barnes
under the most favorable auspices, it was deemed best to defer
the procession of marching clubs until later in the campaign.
One purpose of this decision was to keep the atmosphere of the
pavilion free from the smoke of torches and to avoid the con-
PROMIIEIT LOS AMGELES HEPUBLICAHS WHO WERE VICt-PRESIDEMTS OF THE MEETING AID
ASSISTED 111 ARRANGING FOR THE GREAT RATIFICATION,
fusion incident to the advent of marching clubs. There is no
occasion in this campaign in Southern California to bring both
music and torches to inspire animation.
Mr. Gage's ventilation of Maguire's record on the railroad
settlement bill in Congress and General Barnes' review of Ma
guire's checkered career as crank and single taxer, and his refer
ence to the "Little Giant's" sympathy for anarchists and nihil
ists, never fail to exalt their audience to a high degree of en
thusiasm. As the journey through the south progressed, the
confidence of Mr. Gage and General Barnes in the triumph of
the Republican cause increased. The day of doubt, if ever it
dawned, soon vanished. Now it is a question of Gage's ma
jority. Every hour brings a record of desertion from the fu
sion ranks. The Silver Republicans are again marching under
the banner of the old party. Democrats at every meeting
place told Mr. Gage that they would vote for him, as they had
no party nominee of their own. The fusionists cherish the hope
that San Francisco will give Maguire 15,000 majority, and on
such a slender thread of hope they conduct the campaign.
ONE A DEMAGOGUE;
THE OTHER A MAN
Chairman J. W. McKinley's Picture of
the Rival Candidates for Guber
natorial Honors.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29.â Before
7:30 o'clock this evening the main floor
and the galleries of Hazard's Pavilion
were densely packed by people eager
to extend a welcome to the standard
bearer of the Republican party, and
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
also to salute General Barnes. After
some delay caused by waiting for the
arrival of the escort, the Americus
Club, from Pasadena, Mr. Gage and
General Barnes were escorted to the
Pavilion.
When the standard bearer stepped to
the platform in view of the multitude
there t went up a great acclaim. Three
cheers were given for "Henry T. Gage,
the next Governor of California." The
j meeting was called to order by Brad-
I ncr W. Lee, chairman of the Repub
lican County Committee, who an
nounced the following vice presidents:

Mr. Lee then announced that Hon.

position said:
Ladies and gentlemen: I desire first
upon this occasion, upon behalf of the
committee, to extend
the thanks of the com
mittee to the Ameri

serve the entire floor for the Americus
Club. (Applause.)
Once more the Republican party sub
mits to the people of the State of Califor
nia its record and asKs them again to in
dorse it. A f<Â»w evenings ago I listened
to the remarks of a gentleman from this
platform who asked the people of Cali
fornia to make him the highest officer
within the gift of this great common
wealth. We might expect upon such an
occasion a presentation of some issues
which were before the peopleâ a discus
sion of some vital principles which he
sought to maintain; but througn that dis
cussion from r>ne end to another we had
nothing but an evasive defense and a dec
laration that he alone of all the candi
dates was the only original anti-monopo
list, the only man who could be trusted
with power. The man who goes through
the country pinging his own praises may
well be watched by the people of this
great Statf (applause); and when he adds
to that the captious criticism of the m;m
we know and love, who has been brought
i:p hero among us and whom we know
to be an honest, independent, fearless cit
izen, the people of Los Angeles County
will say to him: "No sucn self-serving
declarations, no attacks unon your oiw*>

frages or turn iiir barks upon ffcf i..un
wh<ise whole record and life is an open

Ladles and g ntlemen, it is not for me

to follow me to Mk-- up your time when

L.OS ANGE-ES. Sept. 29.â The intro
duction of Mr. Gage was the signal for
a prolonged storm of applause. Never
was a larger assemblage convened in
the spacious pavilion and the cheers
repeated many times attested the sin
cerity and depth of welcome. Henry
T. Gage spok. as follows:
Mr. Chairman, friends and neighbors:
I assure you that if I followed the
promptings of my,
heart my voice would
not be heard here to- j

treraely difficult for
me to speak in behalf

tinguished opponent assailed me as a fool.
In the Herald he declared that he had not
said that I was a 1001. I had a shorthand
report of his speech and he was. nearly
right, for he had not said that I was "a
fool, but he said, "How foolish Gage is,
how foolish." Tweedle dura, tweedle dee.
Those opposed to me find fault with the
cut of my clothes. Now I don't think that
Is fair. I don't think they have any right
to find fault with these clothes. They
should wait to see what kind of a suit I
will wear on the night of my inaugural.
(Applause and laughter.) Then they, say
that I put my hands in my pockets, and
they criticize the boots that cover my
feet, and they are. not content with th
hair that God has put on my head. Th
Herald says I cannot speak. When I do
speak they say I have not done so and
want "to know "who writes Gage's
speeches." Let me tell my friend Spauld
ing that the same .man ' writes Gage's
speeches whom he and his friends have
paid large sums of money to for defend
ing them in libel suits. (Laughter and
applause.)
I want to thank the entire audience, one
and all, for this magnificent demonstra
tion to the Republican' party, to the AJax
of orators of the ' Western Hemisphere,
and to myself. I have always loved my
fellow/townspeople, and such scenes as

The gentleman who stood upon the ros
trum the other night, I understand, 'was
" ; "- ''"-' â¢'-"â¢- â ;â ;.. extremely enthusias
tic . about his election.
I do not look at It that
way. I have traveled
over seven counties of
this. State within the
last, ten days, and I
assure you that the
Republican party will
l ______^_^^_ triumph In every one
""^^^^^^^^^^â¢ of these counties. (Ap

tion In my mind about the ultimate re-
BUlt, no question that the Republican par
ty will triumph, as it ought to. -.The only
question is, How great will be the ma
jority. (Applause.) - ,
Now I ; charged In a speechâ an Im
promptu speech, as all of mine areâ in
this , hall , that Mr. Magulre had stood â¢ in
Congress and voted on lines opposite to
those from which American bullets were
flying. That seems to have disturbed my
opponent considerably. He has ' demand

Yes, but he did something more, now
that he has called for the record. He
vot^d against the issuance of bonds to
carry on the war. He says he did not
vote against the bonds. This is what he
did: He voted for the bonds if thÂ«y
6hould be issued as non-interest bearing
bonds. Suppose a man should go to the
bank and borrow money and he should
eav to the banker: "I want to borrow
ten thousand dollars. I will give you my
note for it, payable in twenty years with
out interest." How much money do you
suppose he would get? Mr. Maguire is a
lawyer. Did he not know as a lawyer
and as a business man that if those bonds
were put upon the market non-interest
bearing they never could be negotiated?
Even a. fellow as foolish aa he thinks I

am would know better than that. (Ap
plause.) And I would like to ask If .that
is not voting on lines opposite to those In
which American bullets were flying?
Fellow citizens, he stood In Congrebs
and did not vote for that bill which pro
vided that the gallant , râ .
soldiers who went,
forth to battle for you]
and for me. to battle!
for that dear old flag,
should have the right
to vote. HÂ« stood in
Congress and refused
to give them the right
of suffrage. What re
spect for the war'-
A Foe of
the
Soldiers.
What respect for the soldier! I would not
refer to this matter in detail, except that
he stoocl upon this rostrum and said what
I had said in that connection was untrue
and inaccurate, and defied me to produce
the record. And. fellow citizens, who in
responsible for his course? He, to his
country and to his God; but the Demo
cratic party in its platform the other day
declared in favor of and commended the
acts of every Democratic Congressman
in California. They indorsed by that res
olution his conduct.
Now the pages are as follows: That in
reference to the disfranchisement of the
soldier is House bill No. 10,550; and I call
hi? attention at the same time to the
Congret>slomtl Keco"3?C! ot jum 10, -IS9B,
pages 6390 and (5391. Upon the bond ques
tion, referring to his support of Mr.
Bland's amendment, the action reported
in volume 31, No. 104, Congressional Rec
ord, April 29, 1898, and also in the same
volume, page 4844.
I claim that until he has disposed of
those records, the propositions that he
complained or in mj' original speech still
stand. (.Applause and cries of "Good!
good"')
1 understand that the learned gentle
man complained bitterly because in my
speech here from this rostrum 1 had Baid
that he had the power to stand in Con
gress when the refunding amendment
came up. and, by raising a single objec
tion, to have defeated the consideration
and passage of that bill. And he says:
"Why, how foolish that man Gage is!
Don"t he know that was part of the great
deficiency bill, running into millions and
millions and millions of dollars? Does
Gage think that by rising up in Congress'
I could have said that ana stopped tho
wheels of the Government?" That is the
way he answers the question.
My remarks were never directed to the
deficiency bill. They were directed to the
refunding amendment and he well knows
it. That refunding amendment was the
proposed law whicn is now an operative
statute of the Congress of the United
States, providing for the entire disposition
of the controversy that existed between
these great railroads and our country. It
provided that the company should pay
upwards of fifty-nine millions of dollars
to the Government in ten years, in twenty
equal annual payments, with Interest up
on interest.
It would appear to me that if a man
owed another a large sum of money and
. he paid every dollar
that he owed and in
terest, too, the credi
tor would have no
ground for complaint.
That is exactly what
this bill did. The bill
passed the United
States Senate and
went to the House.
Maguire
Failed
To Object.
."â "^^""â ^"^ . There when the ques
tion arose Mr. â  Barham, from this State,
proposed an amendment. That amend
ment Mr. Maguire in a speech- the other
day said was a. good one. Congressmen
concede that if Barham's amendment had
not been adopted Congress would have
voted down the bill. If.that is so,, and it
were in the power of Mr/Magulre to have
said "I object," and prevented the ; pass
age of the bill, what , right , has â he- to
stand upon this rostrum and denounce the
Republican v party â¢ because ' that bill
â  passed ?i= (Applause). ,â ', â â  â Â â¢ Â«-.*:;â¢-- -. >
Let us read the record upon that sub
ject and -you will say that, while I spoke
extemporaneously oh the ; occasion â  re
ferred to, I was^right.. . .'â¢ Â-. ;
Mr. Gage here read from the Con
gressional Record, presenting the facts
as he presented them in his ifreat
epeech at San Diego. After citing the
Record, Mr. Gage resumed his speech
proper, speaking as follows:
There was no objection. (Applause.) So
it was in the power of the man who stood
upon this rostrum and goes forth over
this State assailing that bill to have ab
solutely stopped and prevented Its pas
sage. Then, why did not he do it? Not
having done it, what right has he to
travel this State over and" brand the Re
publican party with dishonor and dishon
esty for allowing an act which he him
self helped to consummate? 1 say, none
whatever. Why does the gentleman call
this bill a Republican measure, please tell
me? Who wrote the bill? A Democrat
âa brave, a loyal, an honest Democrat,
Mr. Morgan of Alabamaâ was the author
of that bill. (Applause.) After he had
introduced the bill into the United States
Senate, a gentleman of integrity, of hon
esty, one whom you all know, proposed
an amendment to it. guarding the rights
!of the people. It was none other than
I that stalwart Republican (Mr. Gage
! speaking ironically), Stephen M. White.
| (Applause.) Every member of the United
1 States Senateâ every Democrat, every
! Populist, every Republicanâ voted for It
' That bill passed the United States Senate
by a unanimous vote.
WHI you kindly tell me when it was
that my distinguished opponent became
possessed of more patriotism, more hon
eÃty, more wisdom than the entire Unit
ed States Senate? I say that any bill that
i passes that great body and receives the in
dorsement of every Democrat, every Re
puolican, every Populist, must have vir
tue in it. It would seem to me that this
I argument nearly disposes of the entire
Democratic contention ti.at there is no 1b-
I sue before the people of this great State
iin this campaign but that bill. That fs
i sue has been long since decided â decided
ibv the unanimous vote of the United
â¢ States Senate and by the House, too, and
jis the law of the land. That being set
! tlÂ«d, that being the only question, it
: would seem that their duty now would be
to vote for a party that presents an iwsue;
the Republican party. [Applause.]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1898.

Tax
An Issue.
niaâ they say that It is not an issue in
the campaign. Why not? The Democrat
ic party In its platform has declared in
favor of and commended every act of
every Democratic Congressman in the
United States. Mr. Maguire advocated
and voted for the single tax. If they
commend every act of his haven't they
indorsed the single tax, and is it not an
issue in the campaign? [Applause.]
Mr. Maguire, in Congress, denied the
right of the land-owner to own his lands.
Mr. Maguire, in Congress, by his speeches
and by his vote, denied the right of the
mine-owner to take ore from his mine;
and the Democratic party has indorsed
his acts in Congress. 1 wonder how the
mine-owner will vote on election day.
General Barnes will tell you.
I thank you for your attention. .
The audience gave the closest'at/fn
tion to Mr. Gage's remarks arid cheered
to the echo the exposure of. Maguire's
double dealing in the railroad settle
ment bill. The sentences devoted to a
review of Maguire's single tax record
were listened to with eager interest.
The applause at the conclusion of the
speech was hearty and prolonged.
GENERAL BARNES
1 ON EVOLUTION
Traces the Democratic Party Up to
Thomas Jefferson and Then
Down to Maguire.
LOS ANGEIES, Sept. 29.â Chairman
McKinley's introduction of General
Barnes was a simple compliment to the
eloquence and loyalty of the orator.
The vast multitude did the rest of the
greeting with an outburst of applause
which made the pavilion tremble.
After recognizing the reception, General
Barnes addressed the audience. In the
course of his remarks he said:
The Republican and Democratic plat
forms, so far as they treat of subjects
of nnllnnnl Â«Â« woll nu
local interests, are in
substantial accord.
The triumphs of our
army and navy meet
with hearty commen
dation in each. They

of the
Democrat.
'publicans indorse the
administration; the Democrats the ac
tion of Congress with reference to them
all. Each approves territorial expansion
and the retention of Porto, R.ico, Guam
and the Philippines. Upon the subject of
Hawaii the .Republican platform Is ex
ultant, while the Democratic is omin
ously silent; but they demand the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal. The
Republican calls for the enforcement of
the act of Congress passed at its last
session for the collection of the indebt
edness due from the Central and West
ern Pacific railroads, and declare In fa
vor of the prompt enforcembent of the
law in case of default in the payments
provided for in that act. The Demo
cratic platform favors the immediate
foreclosure of the Government Hens upon
these roads, and denounces the refunding
measure passed by the unanimous vote
of the Senate and as amended by Mr.
Barham of California and passed by the
House; but they commend the appropria
tion for the improvement of San Pedro
harbor. Both make the usual declara
tions, with reference-,to the protection of
labor. Both favor the University of Cal
ifornia. Both declare in favor of good
roads. Both favor the protection of min
ing interests, and demand the preserva
tion of mineral lands for occupation and
development by the miner. Both demand
the improvement of the navigable high
ways of California. Both declare against
the traffic In adulterated foods. Both
favor the use of the allied trades' label
In political printing. Both demand that
the products of prison labor in other
States be not permitted to be sold in
any other State than that of their manu
facture. Both declare in favor of the
legislative approval of municipal char
ters. Both demand purity of election
laws. Both demand the passage of such
laws as shall maintain the common
schools of California in their present
high standard, and continue the print
ing of school books by the State.
.The Democratic party, however, in its
prelude affirms its perpetual allegiance to
the principles of momas Jefferson.
Thomas Jefferson was Indeed a great Re
publican. â¢ It was he who first gave to a
political party in the United States that
great name. He brought with him from
France, where he had been Minister and
Envoy of the United States, succeeding
Benjamin Franklin. He was a magnifi
cent specimen of manhood, of enormous
Ehysical proportions, with a face whose
eautiful sublimity drew to itself the ad
miration of all who beheld it. He was a
profound student, simple in his manners
and abhoring all titles of any kind. He
refused as President to be addressed as
"Excellency," or "Honorable," or even
"Mister." He inaugurated the present
method of addressing the executive head
of the nation as "Thomas Jefferson, Pres
ident of the United States." There have
been few greater men or grander names
than that borne by Thomas Jefferson,

Such is the law of evolution from sim

versed the great law
of nature. It began
with Jefferson and
ended with Maguire.
It is sad, indeed, to
think that such a
party should have

flect that since 1809
And Back
to

there "has been no single Democratic I
President whose name has a household
value to the Democracy or whose memory
1b worth preserving. They pass in silence
the names of Jacfcson, the hero of New
Orleans; Polk, the annexer of vast terri
tory of Mexico and the land upon which
we live, and they never paid even the poor
courtesy of a passing glance at Grover
Cleveland, the only Democrat who, since I
the exodus of James BurfiTanan. l.as poa- I
sessed efther the mentality, ability or
moral force to bring the Democracy from I
the cataleptic fit in which it lay insensible
for thirty years.
What is the matter with Grover Cleve
land? He is one of the striking charac
ters-of modern history. There has prob
ably been no statesman at any time in
the history of the United States who pos
sessed so thoroughly the courage of his
convictions or turned his back more reso
lutely- upon any species of paltering or
temporizing for the purpose of mere poli
tical success. He believed in free trade,
or rath#r in tariff for revenue only, and
the Wilson-Gorman pill was the direct re
sult of his strongly enforced teachings.
For its failure to provide he found his
own reasons, to which the Republican
party has never been able to agree, only
recognizing the fact that under such a
system the revenues of the country were
insufficient to meet even its current ex
penses, and Mr. Cleveland, in his second
administration, was compelled to borrow
two hundred and sixty millions of dollars
for the ordinary and necessary disburse
ments .of our governmental system.
Notwithstanding the failure of his
tariff system artdthe borrowing of large
sums of money in time of peace, Mr.
Cleveland waa still the idol of the better
portion of his party, and hl B . flrm resist
ance to the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 and his ad
herence to his views on the financial ques
tion, notwithstanding the pressure
brought to bear upon him by the politi
cians of his party, is one of the most re
markable instances of individual courage
and resolution to be found in the records
of American statesmen.
It cannot be doubted if Mr. Cleveland
had been willing to yield his views upon
the silver Question to.
the demands of west
ern politicians, he
would have been the
candidate of his par
ty In 1896, and Colo
nel Bryan would
never have been

was strong enough to adhere to the view
which has had the approval of the best
financiers of our time, he is as forgotten
and neglected by the party, so greatly in
debted to him. as if he had lived and
died in "the time of the pyramids, and
â¢was encased in the mummy wraps which
are supposed to contain the remains of
Rameses 11. ' -~
I should like to learn Mr. Cleveland's
views, even though they hark from the
tomb, of this present nauseating political
compound which the people of this State
are expected to swallow.
But before proceeding further to the
consideration of the only platform which
Is really adverse to the prosperity of the
Stateâ l mean that Populistlc platform,
which, in July and August last, Mr. Ma
guire indorsed, and to whose principles
he agreed to devote himself heart and
soulâ permit me to say a word on the is
sue which Mr. Maguire appears to have
made out of my poor personality.
At one time he represents me as a rail
road attorney, doing Republican politics
at the bidding and for the hfre of my
master; at another as the paid stipendiary
of Henry T. Gage, traveling with him
throughout the State, with no more heart
in the cause than any other man has In
a job of work which he Is paid to do.
I was a Republican before I ever knew
there was such a corporation as the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad Company, or that
any such gentlemen existed as those who
were principally concerned In Its building
and operation. I have been resident In
California more than a quarter of a cen
tury. There has never been an election.
State of Presidential, when I have not
contributed what I could to the success
of each Republican ticket. I have done
so independent of any professional rela
tions with the Central Pacific or the
Southern Pacific Company. I have- never
sought an office or received an honor, an
emolument, or a dollar, airectly or indi
rectly, from anybody for ray services such
as they were. And nobody knows the fact
better than Mr. Magulre.
It is hardly a month since he told me
in conversation that he honestly believed
1 was free of every corporate influence
and that my political action, whatever it
was, had been and would be free of rail
road influence. He will probably deny
this and repeat, as he has so often, that
I am a dog wearing "the railroad collar.
Not satisfied with that, Mr. Maguire has
declared that in 1Â£75 while he was an
officer of the National Guard and acted
as such upholding law and order and for
the preservation of lives and property in
San Francisco against a riotous demon
stration that was largely provoked by
General Barnes, -he calls my attention to
the fact that he was on duty on Howard
Btreet, between Third and Fourth, in
Civilian dress, but as a military officer,
detailed from headquarters to try to pre
vent a riotous raid on the offices of The
Call and Bulletin tin San Francisco, in
September, 1575, when the citizen. 5 ? were
being lashed to fury by the furious at
tack upon the proprietors of those papers
by General Barnes and others who seemad
regardless of the consequences of their in
flammatory speech.
I do not know whether Mr. Maguire was
ever an officer of the State militia or not
âvery likely he may have been. But so
far as the charge is concerned that I was
at that time an inciter of mob violence,
let me say a word:
In August, 1875, William C. Ralston,
theretofore president of the Bank of Cali
fornia, died by drown
ing in the bay of San
Francisco. Three days
later he was buried,
followed to his grave
by a concourse of the
people of San Francis
co over three miles in
length. One of the
papers referred to by
Mr. Maguire, on the
afternoon of his funeral, published a
broadside on the life and character of Mr;
Ralston which was generally believed to
be unfounded in fact and to be published
for a political purpose only.
I had been Mr. Ralston' s attorney and
his most intimate personal friend. A
meeting was called by the best citizens
of San Francisco for the purpose of ex
pressing sympathy with his widow and
children and condemning the course of the
journals referred to by Mr. Maguire. I
was at that time the attorney for both
the Bulletin and The Call, and attended
the meeting after a full conference with
their proprietors. They strongly disap
proved my going to the meeting, but I
felt it my duty to do' so. I did. I made
a speech there to a portion of a meet
ing consisting of 20,000 of San Francisco's
best citizens. It wjls a meeting opened
with prayer, by the ReV. D.r. Platt of
Trinity Episcopal Church, and at the close
of my femarks, in which there was not
one inflammatory sentence or one 'soli
tary incitation to mob' violence, I used
the following Language:
"Major Smiley has said that there was
at one time in the breasts of the people
of California a certain rude and heroic
sense of justice that prompted them to
wreak vengeance upon the spot, but we
live in a different time and for higher
and nobler purposes. The people of San
Francisoo, when .they speak to-night, will
make their calm, dignined, manly pro
test to the World. No act of violence nor
evil thoughts 'shall live in our hearts in.
the presence of the dead. We come to
speak of him, to say to the world how
much we loved him; and to all mankind
that the calumnies that have gone forth
sown on the wind like the fallen leaves
of autumn have left not one solitary
shadow of a shade in the hearts of the
people of San Francisco which affectÃ
that man's memory. That is what this
meeting is for: that is what we are all
here for, and when we go to our homes,,
when we bear away the memory of this
meeting it will have mingled with it noth
ing unworthy the occasion, nothing un
worthy the citizen, the man and the
friend we have lost, and we shall act as
befits men who feel they are speaking not
to themselves but to civilisation."
Nailing
a
Falsehood.
There wag : never '' at - any - time In that
meeting an incitatlon to mob -violence or
a disposition toward It. Where Mr. Ma
guire was on > that great night I do not
know,. nor â¢ do -l\ care, for there was never
then Â» nor ever, so > far as the : death of
Mr. Ralston was concerned, any need for
Mr. Mag-Hire, in cy.viUan.> dress or in mar

: willing to â¢ be'? held. tip . even â by so poor
and uncorroborated Authority as Judge
Maguire, as a mobocrat, and I am unwill
ing 'that .even by misrepresentation he

has been bo justly bespattered. . Â : â¢
Before closing General Barnes re
viewed the- Populist platform and ad->
dressed many of his remarks to the Sil
ver Republicans. In this connection
the name of William McKinley was
mentioned. It was. the signal for great
applause. Five thousand people listened
to the ma9terly appeals to the patriot
ism of Democrats and Silver Repub
licans. The meeting closed with ring
ing cheers for the orator, for Henry T.
Gage, the next Governor, and for the
whole ticket.
Gage and Barnes will leave 'to-mor
row, to arrive in San Francisco Satur
day morning.

JUDGE MAGUIRE
TALKS AT TULARE
He Receives but a Weak
Reception.
CROWD NOT A LARGE ONE
NO ENTHUSIASM SUCH AS
GREETS GAGE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TULARE, Sept. 29.â James Q.
Maguire, fusion candidate for Gover
nor, addressed the people of Tulare to
day. The speaker arrived on the morn
ings train, and was met by a delegation
of local fuslonists, headed by the Tu
lare Silver band, and escorted to the
parlors of t\e Central Hotel, where an
infdrmal reception was held. With Mr.
Maguire were T. "W. Maples, candidate
for Controller, and E. L. Hutchison,
candidate for Lieutenant Governor.
Chairman C. L. Russell opened the
meeting. Referring to Maguire as the
"head of the anti-railroad forces," he
said:
"James G. Maguire cannot be tracked
by the quarters Huntington has
dropped."
He then, introduced him as "The next
Governor of California." The crowd,
which was not very large and made up
mainly of women, was evidently in
sympathy with the Speaker,' and
cheered lustily.
The speech was disjointed and dis
connected. Mr. Maguire confined him
self to no one issue of the campaign.
He charged the Southern Pacific Com
pany with the management of the Re
publican campaign. He had much to
say of the "oligarchy of wealth," of
"monopoly and the concentrated pow
er of privilege." He referred to Bryan
as; "that matchless American and sec
ond Thomas Jefferson," and to Gage
as "my distinguished opponent."
Touching upon the war with Spain,
Mr. Maguire denied the assertion that
it . was a Republican war, and stated
that the neglect to provide food and
medicines for soldiers in camp was a
"chapter of shame. 1 -' Said he:
"More deaths have occurred inVamp
than in the entire struggle, including
the loss of the men on the battle-ship
Maine."
He spoke briefly of the Pacific rail
road debts, the war revenue and the
single tax.
"The intellectual part of the cam
paign," said Mr. Maguire, "is conduct
ed by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company or under its direction."
The meeting was not in any sense a.
brilliant reception either in numbers or
enthusiasm. The speaker left for
Visalia at 4 o'clock.
EXLAINS HIS VOTE
ON THE REVEINUE BILL
VISALIA, Sept. 29.â The Democrats
opened their campaign here to-night
with Maguire and Hutchison as the
speakers. People came from thirty
miles around. An excursion over the
motor road from Tulare brought two
carloads. Armory Hall was filled.
Maguira spotye oÂ» joattonal issues,
giving the reason, for his vote on the
revenue bill. He paid his compliments
to Gage and Barnes, saying he had
Bung in G as well as B flat. He said
he favored a reasonable appropriation
for district fairs, including stock ex
hibitions and contests for speed horses.
He would have the fairs equally dis
tributed, but he did not favor fairs run
as gambling institutions. He spoke of
the late war, claiming it was as much
a Democratic as a Republican war,
though the Democrats were not re
sponsible for the suffering of the sol
diers in camp. He denied that he had
opposed any appropriation asked for
carrying on the war. The speech was
well received and often applauded.
Mr. Hutchison made only a short ad
dress. T. W. Maple Jr., nominee for
Controller, is here in company with
Maguire.

lingford and her "Demon, in next

cials of the French Foreign Office, the
first secretaries of the Embassies and
General Hegron, Secretary of the Ely-

The breakfast at which the two Peace
Commissions met for the first time
to-day was purely an informar*affair.
given by M. del Casse in his private
apartments in the Foreign Office.
The Spanish Commissioners arrived
first, accompanied by the Spanish Em
bassador here, Senor Leon y Castillo,
and the secretary of the Spanish Em
bassy. The United States Embassador,
General Porter, and Henri Vinaud, sec
retary of the United States Embassy,
arrived at the Foreign Office before the
American Commissioners and awaited
them there. The American party ar
rived nn the stroke of 12:30. the hour

NEW DAUGHTER OF
THE CONFEDERACY
Miss Lucy Lee Hill to Wear the
Left by Winnie
Davis.
CHICAGO. Sept. . 29.â Miss Lucy Lee-
Hill, an examiner In the office of the civil
service commission, is the new Daughter
of the Confederacy. Her Southern friends
have conferred this honor upon her since
the death of Miss Winnie Davis. During
the day she received numerous- congratu
lations. '- i
Miss Hill is a native of Virginia, and
comes from one of the oldest i and most
aristocratic families in the South. She
is a distant relative of General Fitzhugh
Lee. In 1893 she came to Chicago as one '
of the World's Fair commissioners from
Kentucky, and since then she has made
this city her .home. -
Miss Hill said to-day: "Yes, my friends
in the South insist that the mantle -of
Miss Winnie Davis shall fall upon my
shoulders. You see, I have always been
considered next in rank, and the .- death
of Miss Davis naturally enough confers
the honor on me. Miss Davis and myself
were chums. We went to school together,
and our families were Intimate. My father
was General A. P. Hill, a warm â¢ personal
friend of Jefferson Davis. My father was
killed on the last day of the siege of
Vicksburg, while fighting at the head of a
column." -â â¢ â  " ' â¢

CUBANS INSIST ON
COLLECTING CUSTOMS
So Their Agents Clash With Com-
mander Maynard of the
Nashville.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 29.âAd
vices reaching here from Gibara to-day
give information of a serious dispute be
tween the Cuban Government there and
Commander Maynard of the Nashville.
The commander of the Nashville is the
only representative of United States au
thority there. He has appointed Ship's
Paymaster- O'Leary to act as Customs
Collet-tor <*f the Port, levying duties ac
cording to' the Spanish tariff, as at San
tiago. The Cuban looal government levied
a tax of 16 cents a barrel on all stuffs
forwarded by General Blanco to the Span
ish garrison at Holguin, and would not
allow trains to leave the station until this
duty had been collected. General Nario,
commanding the Spaniards, protested to
Paymaster O'Leary, who, with the con
sent of Commander Maynard, upheld the
protest, taking the view that the mem
bers of the Spanish garrison were prison
ers of war and that all supplies to them
should be admitted duty free. The Cu
bans In turn protested that food taken to
Holguin, ostensibly for the Spanish gar
rison, was sold to merchants to be dis
posed of to the public. The matter will
be referred to Washington.
AIDING A RAILWAY VENTURE.
Plan of Eureka Officials to Purchase
a Right of Way.
EUREKA, Sept. 29.-A. largely attended
mass-meeting at Russ Hall last evening
was addressed by Mayor Evans and
Lawrence Puter relative to the proposi
tion to expend 110.000 by the city to
purchase rights of way and construct a
boulevard along the city front for the
common use of the railroad companies
The Eel River and Eureka Railroad
owned by John M. Vance, and the Eu
reka and Klamath River Railroad, the
property of the John Vance Mill and
Lumber Company, are anxious to get
rights of way through the city along the
water front, but there is a strong senti
ment for the city to open First street and
put it In condition for railroad building
and allow all companies equal privileges.
The outside companies also are anxious
to secure franchises. The City Council
will probably act in the matter at the
next meeting.
Indications are promising for activity
in railroad building in Humboldt County.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.â The war
Investigating committee confined itself
largely to-day to the examination and
classification of complaints which have
been made to the President. A large
number of such complaints have been
received at the White House. They
come generally in the form of letters
and are for the most part from relatives
of enlisted men. Those examined at
this session deal in the main with
Camp Wikoff and Camp Thomas, but
some of the letters also make charges
concerning other camps. They relate
especially to the food served to soldiers
and to hospital accommodations, and
none of them were of a very striking
character.
The commission expects to begin to

this end letters were written to General
Merriam, In command of the Depart
ment of the Pacific; to General Otis, in
command of the Philippines, and to
General Merrltt, who occupied this lat
ter post until recently. The letter to
General Merritt is as follows:
"We have the honor to request you to
i furnish us, as early as possible, with
! such information as you have as to the
i adequacy or inadequacy of the quar
i termaster and commissary and medical
| supplies and medical staff for troops
! under your command while in this
country, while en route and while you
were in command at Manila and
| whether or not such supplies were
j promptly and sufficiently issued to all
j troops. Also as to the proper or im
j proper preparation of the transports for
! the transportation of your troops to
â  that station. We will also be pleased
to be Informed as to the rations issued
to the troops."
The letters to Generals Merriam and
Otis are copies of the letter to General
Merritt except that Merriam is asked
to supply information concerning the
expedition to Hawaii.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 29.â The efforts
of Sheriff Harrison to '.'. discover the
I identity of Captain J. Moss Brooks' as
| sassin were . rewarded to-day by the
discovery 1 of a most important witness,
who furnishes 1; damaging evidence
ag-ainst - the story of the , tragedy as ' re
lated by Peter Nelson, the deckhand on
the yacht Chispa. The latest J link to
tke chain of circumstantial evidence
connecting "Pete" with ; the murder is
forged by ' Edwin ;," Atwater, : night
watchman on the l ferry-boat San Ra
fael. ' . â¢ -. .; ,
"The steamer was lying at her moor
ings at the Sausalito dock," said At
water, and I was pacing the lower deck
when I heard three shots and imme
diately afterward heard one of the
deckhands crying "Fire." I rushed up
stairs and into the pilot-house to see
where the fire was, and my gaze was
attracted toward the Chispa by some
body in that direction calling "Help!
Murder!'
"Though the night was dark, by the
anchor light of the Chispa and the
other yachts lying near by I could
plainly discern every object on account
of my superior elevation. I saw the
boats leave the shore for the scene and
perceived Fred Nilson pick Nelson up,
but no boat left the Chispa; of that I
am positive."
Atwater's story effectually dispels all
doubt in the minds of the authorities as
to the truth of "Pete's" tale. It is re
garded as evidence ranking in impor
tance with that of Deputy Marshal
Cramers and "Billy" Harrison, who ex
amined Captain Brooks' body within
ten minutes of the time Nelson claims
he was murdered, and found it stone
cold.
Diver John Roach, with a corps of
assistants, labored assiduously to-day
to find if the waters around the boat of
death had a story to tell, but was re
warded by the discovery of only a few
beer bottles. If the rifle aboard the
vessel was used for the shots fired it
must have been taken some distance
away in a skiff and sent to the bottom,
where it will be almost impossible to
find it.
The authorities have had the San
Francisco police busily at work inter
viewing the persons at the addresses
given in the account book found in the
coat secured by Diver Roach yesterday.
The book is one of the kind used for
advertising purposes and on the inside
of the cover are the words: "'The North
western Railway." Some of the en
tries read as follows: "Mr. Green.
Private Secretary for S. P. Company:
Dr. Willison, 301 Devisadero street: 940
Grove street, 1140 Oak street. 1530 Eddy

ington street, 1009 Devisadero street,
2702 Sacramento street, 2222 Washing
ton street, 719 Geary street."
A note was also found from Mrs.
Shock, 556 Grove street, to Frank
Wheeler, 851 Fulton street, dated June
9, 1898. The authorities will not divulge
the contents.
KILLED IN A TRAIN WRECK.
Northern Pacific Engin-e- Loses His
Life by Jumpu.< wj .
SEATTLE, Sept. 29.â A rear-end col
lision occurred on the Northern Pacific
early this morning at Maywood siding,
resulting in the death of one man. An

MATAAFA MAY NOW
REGAIN THE THRONE
Giver) Permission to Returrj, the
Exile Will Probably Become
King of Samoa.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â The Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Mataafa, the exile, may succeed the late Malietoa
as King of the Samoan Islands. As the result of an agreement be
tween the American, British and German Consuls at Apia, approved
by their respective governments, permission was recently given to
Mataafa to return to Apia from the exile to which he was driven
some years ago. As he held the relationship of a cou^n to the de
ceased King, is is believed by those familiar with the Samoan ques
tion that the natives will elect him to the vacant office. The elec
tion of Mataafa will mean much to the United States. He is partic
ularly favorable to Americans, and when at Apia called himself one.
He was the sovereign of Samoa, but relinquished the throne to Ma
lietoa in compliance with the provisions of the treaty of Berlin. It
is said that his exile was due to German influence, but the fact that
the German Consul should agree to his return at this time, when
there is every possibility that he will be made King v/..uld indicate
that there was little truth in the report. I understand that be
sides permitting Mataafa to return, all of his followers who were ex
iled with him have been allowed to resume their residence in Apia.

cars of the work train.
The extra freight was being pulled by
an old engineer of the road named
Beaumont. When he saw that the col
lision was imminent he tried to save him
self from what looked like instant death
by jumping. He made a flying leap and
was killed in the fall.

NOT THE SAME BROWN.
An International Reflection Upon the
Democratic Nominee for
County Clerk.
Owing to a similiarity of names The Call
yesterday unintentionally did a great in
justice to John A. Brown, Democratic
nominee for County Clerk. The writer
of the article confused Mr. Brown with
a John Brown, well known in south of
Market street political, social and saloon
circles, while the Democratic nominee has
been a trusted and respected employe cf
the well-known dry-goods firm of J. J.
O'Brien & Co. for the past twenty years.
The very fact of Mr. Brown's high posi
tion in the community makes the allu
sions to his character most absurd, and
The Call, having discovered the ridicu
lous mistake, hastens to place Mr. Brown
in proper light before its readers, feeling
certain, however, that none of them who
knows John A. Brown will regard serious
ly the unintentional reflections cast upon
him.
THE DEADLY HATPIN.
Edward Johnson, Who Was Mys-
teriously Wounded, Claims It
Was an Accident.
Edward Johnson went to tne Receiving
Hospital last evening suffering from a
wound in the right lung made with a nat
pln. While he claims that he received the
injury accidentally, the circumstances
surrounding the affair lead to the belief
that the wound was inflicted by a woman.
"When Johnson went to the hospital ho
was accompanied by a woman who
claimed to be his wife. He gave his ad
dress as 235 Kearny street and said that
he had thrown himself down on the bed
in room 27 and the hatpin stuck into him.
The lodging- house at the number he gave
is the Meldrum. and the occupant of room
27 is a milliner from the country, who gave
her name as Mrs. Wayne when she rent
ed the room two months ago.
A knock on the door of room 27 at a
late hour last night failed to bring any
response at first, but finally the lady in
the room condescended to ask what was
wanted. She denied that she knew any
one by the name of Johnson or that she
had been to the Receiving Hospital. She
refused to say anything further. The
proprietor of the house stated that the
lodger was not in when questioned, but
when she answered the knock admitted
that he knew she was there. He also de
nied that he knew anything of the affair.
Johnson's wound was not very serious.
The lung-- was punctured and there was
considerable hemorrhage, but within an
hour after having the injury dressed he
left the hospital. A report of the case
was made to the police, and it will be in
vestigated.
POPULISTS MAKE NOMINATIONS
They Adopt a Platform and Various
Candidates Are Selected.
Ninety-one delegates answered to roll
call when Chairman Dr. John A. Miller
called the municipal convention of the
fusion faction of the People's party to
order in Scottish Hall last night. Dr.
Griswold, of the committee on resolutions,
presented a platform, which was adopted.
George D. Gillespie offered resolutions
which were unanimously adopted Indors
ing: Maguire and fusion.
A motion was carried to proceed with
the presentation of names of candidates
for various offices, all such names to be
referred to the committee on investigation
of candidates. A. B. Kinne placed in,
nomination the name of James D. Phelan
without any attempt at oratory. A mo
tion was made to declare nominations for
Mayor closed, but the chair refused to
entertain the motion.
Gillespie nominated Theodore F. Bonnet
for Sheriff, the convention applauding
Bonnet's name vigorously. Dr. Griswola
nominated Barclay Henley for District
Attorney; J. \V. Reay nanied Jnhr. Brown
for County Clerk; G. A. Hubboll named
R. P. Doolan for Superintendent cf
Streets, and Dr. Griswold offered the
name of Hull McCloughry for Justice of
the Peace.
The convention then adjourned to next
Tuesday night at the same place when
further nominations will be made and
probably a vote taken on some of the
offices.
The Orpheum Gets Another House.
Morris Meyerfela u r.. president of the

opening of the Olympia and on business
relative to the Orpheum circuit. Last
night John Morrissey, manager of the
Orpheum, received a telegram from Mr.
Meyerfeld stating tnat he had secured
a house, in Denver, which will be opened at
once as a part of the circuit. This gives
the Orpheum five homes of tneir own
with booking connections with thirty
three others. The opening of the Denver
house will result in quicker changes on
the bill at the San Francisco house, as
artists will now only play two weeks
here instead of three.

"GOOD THINGS" IN EVIDENCE

Sadly in Need of
Carfare.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 29.â The fates did
not deal kindly with the favorites at the
park to-day. The wise set tried to put
several "g-ood things" over the wire, and
as a result all of the first choices were
beaten. The track was in good condition
and good time was made.
In the opening four and a half furlong
sprint for two-year-olds. Petal, with
Thorpe on her back, was a much better
filly than with Farrell in the saddle, and
won all the way. Crossmolina was en
abled to take the place from Tiburon.
Crossmolina, a 7 to 10 choice, was badly
interfered with at the head of the stretch
by Devin on Tiburon, which rider will
sooner or later have a bad fall, due to his
In the second event Thorpe, the "grand
old man of California," had the leg up
on the 4 to 6 favorite, Shasta Water. Not
withstanding the fact that P F, with
Ames up, was beaten on Wednesday In a
cheap sprint, the ragged outsider com
manded support to-day at odds of 7 and
8 to 1, and at the end won handsomely
from the favorite. Lady Ashley, with
Wilson up, was well supported, but fin
ished third. Cascade, from the so-called
Cambridge stable, ran a ghastly race,
though heavily backed In the over-night
betting.
The over-night ones supported Mollie A,
and the Ironwood mare, favored by three
lengths the best of the start, won all the
â¢way.
In the third event Amasa, the favorite,
at one time looked a winner, but he was
overcome by force of circumstances and
finished second. Trappean was in re
ceipt of a very easy ride from Gus Wilson
and finished third. Wilson is a fair rider,
but outside influences will prevent him
filling a long season in the saddle.
In the two-year-old run at five furlongs
the unfortunate filly Ocorona was to have
been the "big thing." ami the books for

short price of 2 to 5. The "shoo in" did

"framed up" races of the meeting, and
the gold brick contingent are weeping for
car fare to-night.
The final race of the day was captured
by Zarro. The brown horse, with Thorpe
up, as usual got a running start and won
cleverly by three lengths. Magnus took
the place from Joe Levy. Red Glenn,
from the Cambridge stable, an even
money choice, ran an awful race, finish

Burning Brush Does Great Damage.
SALINAS, Sept. 1.9.â Brush near the
bridge at King City being burned to
clear the land took fire this morning- and
set fire to one of the jetties nearest the
bridge which had been built to protect
the same. A large force of men were put
to work, and after a hard fight of several
hours extinguished the flame?, saving the
bridge and the two remaining jetties. The
loss will be about $2000. No insurance.

DEFEATS JOE PATCHEN
Fastest Pacing of the Year and Two
Best Consecutive Heats
Ever Made.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 29.â At the
State- Fair to-day in the presence of a
crowd of 60,000, John R. Gentry defeated
Joe Patchen with ease in the match race
for a purse of $5000. Patchen was the fa
vorite with the immense crowd that filled
the big amphitheater and bleachers and
lined the track for several hundred yards
on each side, but the horse was not in the
best of condition, and was never in the
race. Gentry was driven by Andrews and
Patchen by Marks. The first heat was
won in 2:04*4 and the second in 2:03%, and
Starter Newton immediately announced
that it was the fastest race of the year,
and also that it was the best consecutive
heats ever done by Star Pointer, JoÂ©
Patchen or Robert J.

DIG UP PLUNDER
NEAR ENSENADA
Night Adventure of Two
Strangers.
UNEARTH A BOX OF JEWELS
MYSTERY THAT EXCITES THE
OFFICIALS.
Recalls the Flight, Capture, Impris
onment and Death of a San
Francisco Jeweler Many
Years Ag-o.
Special Dispatch to. The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 29.â Buried treas
ure amountint to $20,000, consisting of
gold coin, jewelry and diamonds, was
recovered in a lonely canyon three
miles north of Ensenada Tuesday even
ing by parties unknown. They were
seen near the spot on Monday after
noon and lights were jeen there that
night. The strangers, two Americans,
were first noticed at Ensenada two
weeks ago. Their actions were sus
picious and they were watched. They
carried on a series of searches of the
road leading to Sauzal, north of Ense
nada, and alB. walked along the beach
north of the latter place.
It was observed that the men In all
their work finally reached the lonely
little canyon somewhat off the road.
Mexicans who kept watch of the two
mysterious strangers noticed a light for
the last time on the evening of Sep
tember 27. That same night the men
drove furiously up to the line and
crossed at Tia Juana early in the morn
ing, after a drive of ninety miles.
Nobody can be found at the line who
knew the men, though the Mexican of
ficials at the Custom House remember
that they passed. On Wednesday
morning the watchers went to the spot
where the lights had been seen and dis
covered a number of excavations, all
oblong and about six feet in depth,
running north and south. It was no
ticed that just above the spot where
the holes were dug was a white stake
driven years ago by a coast survey
party from the United States steamer
Ranger. This stake might have been
a means of identifying the spot.
In one of the holes, the freshest dug,
were seen signs as if a small box had
been pried out of the hard-packed
earth. The affair remained a complete
mystery until yesterday afternoon,
when one or two residents of Ensenada
recalled that early in the 70's a young
San Francisco jeweler, whose name
they could not recall, had absconded
with $20,000 worth of gold, jewelry and
diamond;, making his way southward
through California. He was hotly pur
sued, but managed to get out of the
country into Lower California by steal
ing a horse from Emosa Will of Old
San Diego. Will and J. C. Stuart pur
sued the man into Lower California
and procured the assistance of the
ruralea to hunt him down. He was
captured between Ensenada and Santo
Tomas, but he had no treasure with
him, having previously buried It. He
was sentenced to San Quenttn and died
there three years afterward. It is now
conjectured that he told a companion
in prison where he had buried the treas
ure and that because his campanion
had a long sentence to serve the secret
remained unutilized until recently.

Manager Considine Makes Revela
tions That Promise to Create
a Stir in the Pugilistic
World. Â
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â George Con
sidine, James J. Corbetfs manager,
made some startling revelations to
night relative to the agreement entered
into between Corbett, McCoy and the
officials of the Hawthorne Athletic
Club of Buffalo. He said that the
agreement given to the public aud al
leged to have been signed by the prin
cipals was a fake and that a secret
agreement existed between all parties
interested.
The secret agreement called for a
purse of $20,000 to be divided equally
between the principals regardless of
the result of the fight. This was the
only way, Considine said, that McCoy
would agree to meet Corbett. The pub
lic agreement said that the winner
would take all.
Conaidine further stated that Corbett
was promised 15 per cent interest in
the pictures to be taken of the battle
and that those interested in that feat
ure of the proposed exhibition refused
to reduce their promise to writing.
"Corbett," continued Considine, "has
declared his match with McCoy off and
has notified the Hawthorne Athletic
Club officials to that effect. He will
agree, however, to fight McCoy, the
winner to take all and with no pictures,
before the Hawthorne Athletic Club on
October 15."

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29.â The New York
team gave the most flagrant exhibition of dis
organization and amateur playing probably
ever seen' on the Washington grounds. At the
end of the sixth inning Warner was put out of
the game for kicking. Joyce redistributed the
players with the result that two men remained
as originally placed. Two players refused to
play in positions assigned them. Then began
an exhibition which disgusted the spectators
when they were not moved to laughter by the
antics of the Giants. The farce was stopped
by calling the game back to the end of the
sixth. Attendance, 1000. Score:

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29.â The assassin's bullets have
probably done the work the murderer Intended they should
in the case of General A. J. Smith, Governor of the Na
tional Home for Disabled Veterans at Santa Monica. At 11
P. M. Governor Smith's life hangs In the balance, with no
probable chance of his recovery. AH day long Governor
Smith has been lying upon a bed of pain, suffering torture
from the wounds which cover the upper part of his body.
The ball which passed through the shoulder entered the
lungs, and this is the ball which will probably cause death.

Contrary to all expectations and to

harmonious, the only contest being for
the nomination for Governor, and only
one ballot being taken on that, result
ing as follows: Van Wyck, 350; Stanch

troops in the Spanish war, and said:
Everywhere Democrats were in the van

erâDemocratic heroes all, have written
high their names in the American temple
of fame.
Momentous questions affecting the fu
ture policy of America must be passed

should be the earnest effort of ever>
Democrat to so shape the work of this
convention that it shall render possible
the return to the upper house of our be

lutions was then read as follows:
The Democratic party of the State of
New York in convention assembled de

dizement, but in the Interests of human
ity, liberty and civilization. We glory in
the patriotic devotion and valor of our
brave soldiers and sailors, who have hon
ored the American people and heightened
the luster of our national fame. The
scandalous abuse by the President of his
power of appointment in scattering army
commissions among inexperienced and
incompetent civilians as rewards for per
sonal favorites and to the exclusion of
experienced officers in the service Is
largely accountable for the fearful suf
fering and the appalling loss of life among
the gallant soldiers that has brought
dippvace upon the administration and a
sense of phame to the nation. A Dem
ocratic Congress will, if chosen by the
people, rigidly investigate the conduct
of the war and expose and punish all
who may be responsible for the unneces
sary deaths, privations and sufferings of
the solljders.
A mention of the name of William
Jennings Bryan, made by Thomas Car
mody in seconding the nomination of
Stanchfield for Governor, produced the
greatest demonstration witnessed in
the convention. Delegates stood on
chairs swinging their hats, while from
the galleries men waved hats and even
coats, and one man grabbed a Cuban
flag from the decorations and swung
it amidst the wildest excitement. The
demonstration lasted for several min
utes.
At 3:30, after having adopted the star
ns the ballot emblem and having ap
pointed the usual committees to fill va
cancies, the convention adjourned sine

The new State Committee met soon
after the adjournment of the conven

STATE TROOPS
SENT TO PANA
Striking Miners Beyond
Control.
SHERIFF APPEALS FOR AID
GOVERNOR TANNER WILL PRO
TECT LIFE AND PROPERTY.
But Will Not Aid in Operating the
Coal Mines With Imported
Negro Labor*
ers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 29.âGov
ernor Tanner was called upon by tele
phone this afternoon by Sheriff Colburn
of Pana. The Sheriff said that he had
no further control of the striking min
ers; that he feared there would be an
outbreak within a short time, and that
he had exhausted all his resources. He
askf>d that State troops be sent there.
Governor Tanner Immediately or
dered Captain Craig of Battery G,
Galesburg, to go with his men to Pana
at once, and Colonel John B. Hamilton
of Elgin was also ordered to start with
two of the best equipped companies of
his Sons of Veterans.
Governor Tanner ordered Captain
Craig to camp within the city limits
and protect the life and property of the
citizens, but under no circumstances
should they aid miners or mine owners
in the operating of the mines with for
eign labor, to which the Governor is
much opposed.
PANA, 111., Sept. 29.â Intense excite
ment prevailed here to-day as a result
of last night's street riot between the
imported negro miners and the union
men. The principal streets were filled
with miners and citizens armed to the
teeth. The negro taken into custody
last night, who attempted to take Po
liceman Smith's life by an attack with
a knife, and whose arrest started the
riot, failed to appear in court to-day
for trial. Mine Operator George V.
Penwell, who gave ball for the negro,
also failed to appear. Warrants were
Issued to-day for all the negroes con
cerned in the riot.
How many were wounded and how
severely cannot be learned. No one is
permitted to enter the negro stockades,
and the operators refuse to give out
any information.
H. E. Bishop, a bystander, is the only
white citizen wounded. The negroes
have not shown up on the streets to
day, and it is thought the operators
will keep them within the stockades
until the excitement subsides.
A second encounter between whites
and blacks occurred at the mines after
the first battle near Penwell stockade,
but the firing was scattered.

PROHIBITION
HAS CARRIED
IN CANADA
Majority of Votes Cast for It in

In Some Provinces, However, the Voice of
the People Is Decidedly Against
the Measure.
fteclal Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
QUEBEC, Sept. 29. â Reports from all parts of the Dominion
indicate that the vote for and against prohibition has been larger
than was expected.
â  The indications to-night are that prohibition has been car
ried by a large majority, but probably not. more than one-half of
the registered vote of the Dominion has been cast.
TORONTO, Ontario., Sept. 29.â The
prohibition vote in the province of
Ontario is a big surprise. In 1894 a sim
ilar plebiscite was had and a majority
of 81,000 returned in favor of total pro
hibition. From returns received at mid
night there is a small majority against
prohibition as a result of to-day's vot
ing. Every city in the province went
heavily against prohibition, this city
turning a previous majority for it of
2500 into a majority of 4000 against to
day. The vote cast was light.

the Case Will Fol
low.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 29.â A critical point
was reached in the Jarman-Rea slan
der suit to-day, and for a time it looked
as though Judge Kittredge would sus
tain the defendant's demurrer filed to
the amended complaint Introduced by
Delmas on Wednesday. In such an
event the suit would have been at an
end and Rea cleared of the charge of
maliciously slandering Jarman.
The entire day was given up to ar
gument. Dozens of law books were
piled on the tables in front of the at
torneys and scores of citations were
made by counsel on both sides to sup
port their statements.. The jury was
excused for the day, and in spite of
the assurance that there would be no
sensational features during the day,
the crowd remained and listened atten
tively to all that was said:
Attorney Morehouse finished his ar
gument In support of the demurrer
shortly before noon. Judge Kittredge
then stated that the preponderance of
law and the weight of the cases cited
were in favor of the demurrer and in
timated he would have to sustain it.
This surprised and startled the spec
tators, a majority of whom sympathize
with Jarman.
The court asked Delmas if he had
any further argument to offer why the
demurrer should not be sustained. Del
mas said he had and would begin his
argument at the opening of court in the
afternoon. He talked all afternoon
and made a strong and eloquent argu
ment. He will finish in the morning.
The demurrer in question sets forth
that Rea's utterances about Jarman
are not actionable and slanderous per
se, and that the amended complaint is
defective in that no specific damage is
alleged.
The sustaining of this demurrer
means dismissal of the suit.

FOREST FIRES
ARE SPREADING
In Colorado They Get
Beyond Control.
SWEEP OF MIGHTY FLAMES
REVENGEFUL INDIANS ABE
NOW UNDER SUSPICION.
Cumberland, Wis., Threatened. With
Destruction, as Fires Surround
Three Sides of the
City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
IDAHO SPRINGS, Colo., Sept. 29.â
Forest fires burning on the west side
of the divide are beyond control, and
people, are said to be fleeing for their
lives. How many, If any, have perished
cannot be known, as there is no -way
of getting direct information at this
time.
A light breeze gives the mighty sea
of fire a new impetus, and it goes stead
ily onward, burning everything before
it, with no chance for the saving of
livestock or property.
Cattle are known to be perishing, and
bear and deer and other wild animals
are running to the east side of the di
vide. The damage will be tremendous.
The timber losses amount to more than
any mere money consideration. These
forests cover the headwaters of mount
ain streams, where the snows are re
tained for many months. From such
sources the streams have been carrying
a volume of water sufficient to irrigate
most of the lands of the State west of
the divide, but with the disappearance
of the timber the flow of the streams
will be greatly lessened.
There seems to be a settled opinion
among the ranchers that the forest fires
were st.arted by Ute Indians with mali
cious intent. They say the forcible
ejection of the Indians and their return
to the reservation more than a year
ago, because of their slaughter of game,
made them bitter against the whites.
They are now "playing even," the set
tlers think, and at the same time driv
ing some of the game into Utah, where
they can hunt without being molested
by game wardens.
Henry Grom, one of the ranchers
living at Toponas, Egeria Park, arrived
here to-day from the burning country.
He said:
"The Gore range is on flre for more
than 100 miles. The flres have been
burning there foT some time", and for
the past few weeks have been getting
worse. Fires are also seen In Grand
County, near Kremmling. The ranch
ers are fighting the flames, and when I
left were experiencing great loss in all
kinds of property."
The flres are reported to cover most
of the northwestern part of the State,
and to extend through the counties r/f
Routt, Rio Blanco, Grand, Larimer,
Garfleld, Eagle, Pitkin and .Summit.
They are doing great damage to every
interest of that section.
MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 29.â A Cum
berland (Wis.) special says: Forest
fires are raging on three sides of the

mena are surrounded, and the latter
has telephoned here for help, stating
that the town is already on flre. . The
mills have shut down, the schools have
closed, and business is suspended.
Every precaution is being taken to
save the city.

SHANAHAN WILL THTJNDEB.
He Proposes to Flay Maguire and His

The "middle-of-the-road" Populists who
repudiated James "Gallagher" Maguire

T. W. H. Shanahan, "the tall sycamore"
of Shasta, who heads the Populist ticket
for Governor, will be the principal speak

as Shanahan says that he will throw
some light on the manipulations of
the fusionists at Sacramento. He will
also pay attention to the fusionist can

Mr. Shanahan in his quaint way re
marks that he will play tag with Maguire

TWO MEN CONTRASTED.
I AMES D. PHELAX is a candidate for Mayor.
fi I He holds the omce now, and desires to cling
to it. During his term he has assumed to rep
resent purity in politics, and under his direction
there has sprung into existence the most absolute
bossisai the city has ever known, and Phelan is the
head and front of it. He is a dictator. Under the
guise of the purist he takes upon himself the duty
of saying who shall hold office. He retains for him
Â»clf the patronage of every office. All those who ac-
cept nominations are his puppets. Without giving
the promise to be such, they could never be even
mentioned in convention.
Mayor Phelan accepted the nomination of the
Non-Partisans without knowing what their platform
would be. He did the same thing with the Demo
cratic nomination. With him the office was the
thing; principles were secondary. He is recognized
as having the one guiding principle that Phelan shall
overshadow the ticket. With the assurance that noth
ing would be placed in his way, that he couid name
all the persons playing second fiddles, Phelan was
ready to accept, regardless of any expression of party
policy.
Republicans beheld with perhaps selfish satisfac
tion that Phelan was losing ground. His posing no
longer deluded. He was out for office; nothing more.
His harangues in behalf of purity, even though
echoed by Gavin McXab, ceased to charm. The fact
became evident that a good candidate could defeat
Phelan. Thaf candidate has been found.
The contrast between Phelan and Patton is pro
nounced, and at each point of difference in favor of
the standard-bearer of the Republicans. Patton did
not seek honor. It came to him. He would not ac
cept until he knew the platform upon which he was
to stand, and he declared that unless the platform
advocated certain policies he could not accept.
With him principle was first, and personal ambition
not to be considered, this being exactly the opposite
of the Phelan view. Patton makes no assumptions.
He does not solicit patronage from subordinates and
make acquiescence a condition by which alone they
can be given a place on the ticket with him.
He simply consented to become a candidate for
Mayor when friends urged upon him that he was
the strongest man available. He did this at a sacri
fice, from a sense of duty, and not from a petty am
bition to be elevated from the ranks of private life.
He is modest, yet aggressive. Now that he is in the
fight he is in to win, and not any adroit planning of
the professional politicians so long held in subjection
by the hand of Phelan will be able to defeat him.
Patton is* a man of the people; Phelan a man of the
preying politicians. Patton is frank, making no pre
tense. Phelan lacks frankness wholly, poses, ges
ticulates, avers, but never loses his grip on the ma
chine.
Altogether the contrast is considerable. We take
it to be in favor of Patton.
WORK FOR THE EXAMINER.
THE Southern Pacific Company refused to con
tinue the payment of $1000 per month to the
Examiner, upon the contract between that paper
Â»nd the company, in August, 1894. Eight installments
of $1000 each remain unpaid. The payment for
August, 1894, is already barred by the statute of
limitations, anS cause of action to recover the install
ment for September will be barred at the expiration
of this month. This leaves six installments upon
which Mr. Hearst has still ? live cause of action. He
ought to be reminded that his agents here are neg
lecting to bring suit to recover these installments
before the statute of limitations runs, and he ought
to be reminded daily of this during the campaign, so
that the Examiner will have something to do besides
abuse other people. #
An Oakland man convicted of wife-beating has
wade two attempts at suicide. The melancholy fea
ture of the episode is that even the second attempt
was not successful. The third time is said to be the
charm.
If one reputable citizen saw Policeman Kenville
throw the club which laid little Willie Lynch low, it
does not make any particular difference that other
reputable citizens may be found who did not see htm.
Lilly Langtry may live in California, and she may
not, such being the distinct purport of the tele
graph news. In either case, the State will make a
brave effort to get along at about the usual gait.
A female slave-dealer having been caught, it is to
be hoped that the creature will be given to under
stand that her calling is not adapted to the needs of
this country.
Of course the Government is welcome to utilize
Goat Island, but it can never educate San Francisco
to the point of calling the island Yerba Buena.
THE BOSS-SHIP OF PHELAN.
THERE is such a thing as a political boss ac
quiring more power than is good for him. In
fact, the downfall of all men who have attempted
to rule by securing tontrol of the political machinery
of government may be traced to the bewildering in
fluence of a multiplicity of combinations and the ne
cessity of dispensing too many offices. From the
abdication of Bonaparte, who was the ablest boss
the world has ever seen, down to the eclipse of Boss
Buckley, the story has ever been the same. Indeed,
current history indicates that Mayor Phelan is about
to become an illustration of the invincible prin
ciple. He is already possessed of more power than
is good for him.
There is no denial of the fact that the Mayor is
now master of what is left of the Democracy of San
Francisco. The Committee of One Hundred has
obeyed his will in all its proceedings. None but the
adherents of his machine have been nominated, and
an analysis of the so-called Democratic ticket shows
that almost every candidate is under obligations to
him for his success. Every sane voter in San Fran
cisco knows that the creation of such a ticket as has
been placed before the people by this committee can
mean but one thing. It means that if it is elected Mr.
Phelan will exercise the functions heretofore exer
cised by Buckley, Rainey, Harney and the other
bosses; that is to say, that he will place Phelan Dem
ocrats on guard and use thejr political influence for
the advancement of himself and friends.
Mayor Phelan has but one point in his favor â he
is a respectable man and does not keep a saloon.
But his methods are those of the regulation municipal
manipulator. He packs conventions, pledges those
whom he assists to nomination to give him their
patronage, connubiates with district and precinct
bosses, figures on "purifying" the registers so as to
elect his candidates, and makes nominations for the
purpose of controlling the Election Commission.
The fact that Mayor Phelan says he is honest and
claims to be striving to promote good government
cuts no figure in the matter. Buckley always said he
was honest, and as a matter of fact taxes never were
lower in this city than while he was boss. The
trouble with Buckley was that he gave the offices to
his personal friends, and by initiating hostile legisla
tion compelled the corporations to put him on their
payrolls. Phelan's necessities may never force him
to this latter expedient, but doubtless he will be
found in the end promoting the fortunes of his re
tainers in that way. It is but a step from patronage
brokerage to- boodling politics.
We doubt whether the people of San Francisco will
indorse the Mayor's course in recent manipulation.
We- are certain that the rank and file of his party
will not do so. Buckley was overthrown for prac
ticing the same kind of politics, and unless the peo
ple have lost their heads they will not place in
Phelan's hands the power to create a machine such
as that potentate controlled.
If the Phelan ticket is elected, the Mayor, assisted
by Max Popper, Sammy Braur.hart, Phil Fay and
Gavin McNab, will administer the government.
Popper will probably get the street sweeping con
tract again. Braunhart will handle the Legislature,
McNab will act as special counsel for the Auditor and
Supervisors, and Fay will become Prime Minister to
the boss and lead him around as Jerry Driscoll used
to lead Buckley. We do not deny that this combina
tion would give us "good government" by the whole
sale, but it can scarcely be claimed that it would be
a people's government.
THE TRANSPORT QUESTION.
/~* APTAIN ALFRED PAGET, a British naval
( officer assigned by his Government to observe
the operations during the campaign in the
West Indies, is quoted as having stated recently that
the experience of the war proves clearly that our
Government would do well to adopt the British sys
tem of providing for the transport of troops across
the sea.
It appears that in the British service all transport
ships are under the control of the Admiralty. When
troops are to be shipped, the army authorities make
known to the officials of the navy the number of
infantry, cavalry and artillery, and the various re
quirements in the way of equipments for which trans
portation is to be provided. It then becomes the
duty of the naval office to furnish the transports and
all supplies needed for the voyage, and to take charge
of them until the destination is reached.
All European nations that have large colonial pos
sessions, and are required at frequent intervals to
transport considerable bodies of troops, are said to
have adopted the British system. It certainly does
not lack for reasons to commend it. By the very
nature of their profession naval officers are much
better fitted to arrange for the equipment and man
agement of transports than army officers, and if that
duty were imposed upon them it could be made a
part of their training to master the problems of load
ing and unloading supplies and embarking and dis
embarking troops to the greatest advantage.
Our recent experience seems to have fully justified
Captain Paget's criticism. The work of the Navy
Department during the war with Spain was extra
ordinarily effective and successful. There has been
no complaint of inefficiency in any part of its service,
and yet the number of its enlisted men was increased
from 10.000 to nearly 30,000; the naval militia from
seventeen States were called into service, and some
thing like 100 vessels of various classc were added
to the fleets it had to handle. Had the transports
been also placed under its charge the troops might
have escaped much of the hardship they had to un
dergo.
Captain Paget's criticism is certainly worth the at
tention of our authorities. There are not many
things the British can teach us, but the art of trans
porting troops seems to be one of them.
Yellow correspondents may send word from Porto
Rico that American troops are being starved there,
and the only effect will be to cause people to reiter
ate the opinion that the yellow correspondents are
liars.
There is every disposition to give the War Depart
ment a fair deal, but nobody will accept any excuse
that may be offered for having put a horse doctor in
medical charge of Camp Thomas.
According to the Woodland Democrat, Republican
papers are accusing Republican leaders "with bad
faith." Perhaps this explains why the charges are not
regarded seriously.
A man in jail at Santa Rosa is a defendant in two
divorce suits at once. His condition of mental
anguish must be somewhat mitigated by the fact that
he is in jail.
Fortunately England has matters so arranged that
a warrior may be promoted for gallantry without
sending another perhaps equally brave man down the
ladder.

THE SA:S FRANCISCO CALX,, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30. 1898.
DEMOCRATIC EXPECTATIONS.
SECRETARY KERR of the Democratic Con
gressional campaign committee not only pre
dicts that the Democrats will control the House
of Representatives in the next Congress, but has
made public the calculations on which the prediction
is based, and as it is the first official partisan fore
cast of the result of the coming contest, it is worth
the attention of all students of the political situation.
As reported by dispatches from Washington, Sec
retary Kerr claims the Democrats will make a gain
of one Representative in Alabama, two in Connecti
cut, four in Illinois, three in Indiana, one in Minne
sota, four in New York, one in lowa, one in Ken
tucky, one in Maryland, one in Michigan, two in
North Carolina, four in Pennsylvania, one in Texas,
two in Virginia and one in West Virginia. This will
be a total gain of twenty-nine, which, added to the
153 Populist and Democratic members in Congress,
gives a total of 182 in the next House, or three more
than a majority of that body.
Very little consideration of this list will be needed
to see upon what a flimsy basis the prediction of the
secretary is based. The expected gains in Alabama,
in Texas, in Kentucky and in Maryland may be con
ceded, for the Republican successes in those States
in 1896 were due to a political landslide that is not
likely to be repeated. Moreover, the Republicans of
Kentucky and Maryland have local faction fights in
their ranks which are likely to weaken them in the
Congressional districts. These gains are, however,
the only ones in the list given by Mr. Kerr that seem
at all probable, and evÂ«n they are likely to be offset
by Republican gains in California and elsewhere.
There is nothing discernible in the political situa
tion in New York, Illinois, Indiana, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota to afford the
slightest reason for a confident claim of Democratic
gains from their Congressional districts. In all of
those States the divisions between the silver and the
gold wings of the party are as marked and as ir
reconcilable as they were two years ago. The inde
pendent voters, moreover, are as well aware now as
they were in 1896 that nothing but confusion would
result from a Democratic control of the House of
Representatives. They know that Democracy is
utterly incapable of acting wisely or even unitedly
upon any of the great issues that will come before
the next Congress for settlement. Under these con
ditions of a divided Democracy confronted by a
united. Republicanism, aided by gold Democrats and
the whole body of independent voters, the chances
for Democratic gains in the States named are about
as poor as any ever taken in the field of American
politics.
Secretary Kerr doubtless issued his prediction as
a means of giving encouragement to his party fol
lowers. He made the outlook as bright for them as
he could, and that he had to advance such absurd
claims as these in order to have any basis at all for
his prophecy is convincing evidence that the situation
promises nothing whatever to the Bryanites this year.
ASPECTS OF THE LIQUOR PROBLEM.
THE report of the Commissioner of Labor on
"the economic aspects of the liquor problem,"
which has just been published, is in many re
spects one of the most interesting publications ever
issued from the Labor Bureau. It covers a wide
field, including the monetary conditions, the agricul
tural and other products used in the production of
liquors; the manufacture of liquors as a distinct in
dustry; the transportation of liquors from the place
of production to that of consumption; the consump
tion and traffic in liquors; the revenue derived from
the manufacture and traffic; the laws regulating the
collection of revenue, and the experience and prac
tice of employers in relation to the use of intoxicants.
One of the notable features of the statistical part of
the report is the disclosure of a wide difference be
tween the statistics of the industry given by the
Census Bureau and those of the Internal Revenue.
For the year 1890 the census officials reported 440
establishments engaged in the manufacture of dis
tilled liquors, while the internal revenue officers for
the same year reported 621 1 distilleries. The census
report gave the number of breweries for that year
1248, while the Internal Revenue reported 2156.
Several explanations are given to account for these
discrepancies. It is stated that many of the distilleries
reported by the Internal Revenue are small concerns
engaged in making fruit brandies in the fall, and
were not in operation in June, when the census
enumeration was made. A similar explanation is
offered with respect to the breweries, the statement
being: "The number given in the Internal Revenue
reports is the number paying the internal revenue
tax irrespective of the length of time they were in
operation during the year; while the number given
in the census reports is the number the enumerators
found in operation."
It is significant that these explanations are con
cluded by the statement: "In all probability the
census enumerators neglected to report some estab
lishments that should have been reported." In view
of the enormous difference between 444 and 621 1 dis
tilleries, it seems something more than a "probabil
ity" that the census men had been neglectful in their
enumeration.
Another surprising feature of the statistics is the
showing made of the fluctuations in the wine pro
duction of the country, and its smallness, even in the
best years, when compared with the production of
beer. In 1888 the output of wine exceeded 30,000,000
gallons, and in 1896 the output was less than 16.000.
000 gallons. In the latter year the production of beer
was 1,111,000,000 gallons. There is clearly room for
improvement in American life in that respect, and the
best way to provide for drinking less beer would be
to drink more wine.
Chaplain Mclntyre of the Oregon is rapidly getting
into a condition of mind similar to that of the parrot
whose conversational powers led it into a state of
featherless discomfort.
Certain Chicago people have resolved to. make a
raid on the particular forms of vice to which they are
not addicted. They term this a reform movement.
If Roosevelt declares himself not a citizen of New

gubernatorial aspirations deserve to be defeated.

AMERICAN RULERS AND EASTERN SUBJECTS.
AN ORIENTAL PROBLEM.
"Now it is not good for the Christian's health to hustle the Aryan brown.
For the Christian riles, and the Aryan smiles, and he weareth the Christian
down;.
And the end of the fight is a tombstone white, with the name of the late

And the epitaph drear: 'A fool lies here who tried to hustle the Bast.
A few short months ago no one would have thought these wordo had any
application to the people of the United States. To-day, thanks to the
kaleidoscopic change of situation, Kipling's wholesome advice concerns us
very deeply. We have suddenly became the rulers of several millions of
Orientals, the President has become a despotic monarch, holding undis
puted sway over men of every religion and color; brown, straight-haired
Malays, swarthy, curly headed Negritos Mussulmans and Confucians, Pa
gans and Christians.
All these mixed races are jumbled together on the Island of Luzon,
and whether we keep the whole of this isle or only a portion of it does
not affect the problem very much. It is only a question of degree. In fact,
I think the task the United States is about to undertake the more ap
palling if we have only a portion of the Philippine group under our con
trol. "All or none" should be the motto. With the Americans on Luzon,
the Spaniards on Samar and Mindanao, the Sulu pirates scattered over
the archipelago of islands which clusters in the Mindoro Sea, the way will
be opened for international complications of the very choicest variety. Ger
many, certainly, is only waiting for an opportunity to grab a coaling sta
tion in this^group, and England, having obtained compensation elsewhere
under the new alliance, will probably prove complaisant. France will cer
tainly not be. content unless she gets a slice and then Russia will want to
know why she is to be left out in the cold. Spain vill be powerless to re
sist aggression from any one of these powers unless America comes to her
aid. We may yet find ourselves fightiner side by side with our recent foe
In order to enable her to retain her hold on the Islands we have just
captured.
In short, by our occupation of the Philippines we have created a new
Eastern question have thrown down a bone of contention which is likely
to prove even more troublesome to Europe than the partition of either Tur
key or China. In a large pleasure the preservation of the world's peace
depends 1 pon the manner in which the United States deals with tlie Orien
tals who have been brought under our rule.
This 1 why Kipling's advice is so peculi rly appropriate at the present
Juncture. No man knows the East better than he does; no man has taught
the English-speaking race more about th^ inner life and racial peculiarities
of the Onontals. The first and most difficult of all lessons we have to learn
Is to forget our national habit of hustling. All through the Pacific there
runs a proverb' which, though varying in words, is to . the effect that to
morrow is another day. This being translated into commonsens English
means literally, never do to-day what you can put off until to-morrow.
An English correspondent writing from Manila recently blamed the
American officers for being too hard on the natives. Probably there was a
good deal of truth in his statement and the reported friction between Agui
naldo's forces and the American troops lends color to the assertion. But
the errors made must.be set down to inexperience, not to willful intent. It
is hardly to be expected that American officers, flushed with victory and
fresh from the prompt, business-like methods of their own country, can
all at once fall into the languid, easy-going life of the East. Nor can we
expect American soldiers, citizens accustomed to i dependent, vigorous ac
tion, to - -m all at once how to respect the many curious traits end super
stitions of the Philippine Islanders. Much that seems ridiculous in our eyes
Is reverenced by the Oriental, and it is likely that our men have often,
though unwittingly, given serious offense.
Probably our greatest error has been that we expected the rebels to
work. Even in Cuba we found our allies useless when there was any hard
labor to be done. Not understanding their character we called them lazy,
and- there was trouble In consequence. If we found the Cubans, a com
paratively vigorous race, â¢vith a large admixture of European blood in
their veins, shiftless and idle, it is hard ..o say how we will describe the
quiet, easy-going Tagals. Fortunately the difficulty is likely to grow less
day by day. It will not tii-ke our officers and men long to discover that
it is no use trying to do too much work in such a climate. The drowsy,
perfumed tropical atmosphere will have its effect upon them; they will
learn that the pace which kills is not the pace frr the East. Soon, if they
stay long enough, they will reconcile themselves, a3 far as military discip
line will permit, to a life of lotus eating, leaving the morrow to take care
of itself. There is grave danger in sending new and untried men to fill
posts of administrative responsibility in such a land.. Brimming over with
energy and taking their duty in all. seriousness they will at first rush at
â¢ their work Ah ardor and enthusiasm. Only a few months will be needed
to convince them of the utter hopelessness of this mode of procedure and
then they will fly to the opposite extreme and relapse into a state of apathy
and indifference. It is difficult to say which of these conditions is the
worse, but either way the interests of the nation will suffer.
Even more serious danger is to be feared from the hustling missionary,
who, though a man of peace, is very often the direct cause of war. More
battles have been fought, more men killed through the impetuous self
sacrificing missionary than any other cause. And now, that a new and
rich vineyard has been opened, there will be hundreds of religious enthu
siasts anxious to work in it. The worst of it is that the missionary means
so well one cannot blame him. All he asks for is a chance to lay down
his life in the cause of the Lord, heedless of the fact that his death will
have to be avenged by the slaughter of hundreds.
It will be for the Government to check the missionary's ardor. The
task of converting the Philippine Islanders to any form of Protestantism
is not going to be an easy one. Mostly the native is converted already.
Either he is a Roman Catholic or a Mohammedan. In the former case he
has had 400 years of priestly rule, and the good fathers, having managed
their flock so well for all these centuries, will take good care that it does
not stray into any other Christian fold. As to the Moslems, the Ameri
can missionary, earnest and sincere though he be, will flndvhis labor in vain.
No one, I believe, has ever yet converted a man of this religion by fair
means. For many years a society for the conversion of Mohammedans
was maintained at Constantinople, and it is related that, though it spent
much good Christian gold, its only converts were of the professional c.ass,
bought at so much a head. There remains only the heathen remnant of the
Islanders. These are fierce, untamed savages, belonging to the aboriginal
Malay race, and resembling, in their ferocious characteristics, the dreaded
Dyaks of Borneo. These men will absorb all the self-sacrificing mission
aries who may care to go among them. No intending martyr could wish
for a better opportunity.
Everything will depend upon the personnel of the staff sent to admin
ister the civil government of the Philippines. An entirely new departure
from the recognized political procedure will have to be taken. If I may
make the suggestion, we should use the material already at hand. All
through the East, in China, India, the Straits Settlements, wherever there is
a port doing any considerable trade, you will find citizens of this country.
Many of these are men of great intelligence and commercial probity.p some
have already served ' their country In a consular capacity. They have re
sided long years in the East, their business has brought them into contact
â with every form of native life and they have learned, from hard experience,
the best way to get work out of an Oriental. They know how to respect
and humor the fancies of the natives: they can lead where a whole army
could not drive. Why not select from among the ablest of these men a
staff of administrators to govern our newly acquired colonies? The na
tion could afford to make it worth their while to accept state employment,
and they would form the nucleus for a body of permanent, highly trained
civil servants, specially qualified to grovern our foreign possessions.

A WRITER'S NAMEâ Pseudonym, San

a writer to reveal his or her true name
even to the publisher of the matter of

or herself to a publisher under a pen
namp and be known by that name, and
all business can be transacted under that
name. Such writers ate p&Jd according
to the rules laid down by the publish
ers, and as all publishers do not follow
the same rule it is impossible to give
the various methods employed. Short sto
ries are paid for' by those who use them
according to merit, as a rule, but there
are some publishers who have a cast
iron rule of paying so much an inch of
space occupied in prir.t for all matter,
good, bad or indifferent, so long as it is
accepted. "Without an examination of the
pay roll of the daily newspapers that
publish short stories it would be a mat
ter of impossibility to state' with a de
gTee of certainty if a majority of such
short stories are furnished by the writers
without pay.

A LADY REPORTERâ B. M. L., City.
Some of the brightest reporters, men and
women, employed on the newspapers of
the United States are those who have not
had a college education, while many of
the worst failures are those who have
entered the profession from col'egss arid
universities. The former have a natural
aptitude for the profession, have a fac
ulty of being able to write good English,
can tell what will make a good m'ws
item, are Indomitable, energetic and are
able to tell in a comprehensive way all
that they seÂ«, all that they hear, and
which is requisite in the presentation of a
readable news item. The latter as a gen
eral thing are too prosy and have to
travel all over the field of literature to
cull flowers of thought to make a pre- "
sentable bouquet. Many of these make
good writers when they are given time
and subject, but as a rule they do not
make the best reporters. There .are
women who have developed considerable
ability as reporters, but they are those
who attend strictly to the work assigned
them and are read^ to undertake any de
tail that a man would be assigned to.

46 miles an boor at Point Reyes, and at

The independent puzzle Is as complex
as ever, and although the convention is
called for to-morrow evening, no one out
side of the promoters of the movement
knows much about it. All kinds of a-ssur
ances are given that there are many
prominent citizens suporting the move

because they do not want to be subjected

clare that ex-Mayor John L. Da\ie will
certainly be on the ticket as a candidate
for County Assessor, arid in addition it
is pro! able that John English may be
nominated by the independents for Coanty
Clerk. Opinions differ regarding this
somewhat mysterious new party. Some
think there may be no convention; others
that It will be a tame affair, while this
evening there was a report on the streets
that there is likely to be a riot, as sev

O'NEIL AS
NANCY SYK.ES
Morosco's "Trilby" is a soft, pale per
formance by comparison with the
"Oliver Twist" that was given in the
Columbia last night. It was melo
drama to the last limit, and Miss Nance
O'Xeil reached her superlative in the
part of Nancy Sykes. All the rough
nen of v< ice and method and the
Vepuvian personality that have been
more or less too much for the other
roles that she has played here were
given full vent and she played the part
as it has never been played here before.
Nancy is a character that demands of
an actress strength, health and frank
brutality. There is no mincing mat
ters; no delicate compromises. The
part will stam' for no feminine bland
ishments. It is hard and terrible; ir
these qualities lie its spell and Its grim
pathos". Miss O'Neil did not spare an
atom of her vanity in playing it for all
that it was worth. She was large,
husky, dark and unpretty to gaze upon,
and she moved like a ship in a storm:
but she was the Nanry Sykes of Dick
ens and we all were in a goose-fiesh of
appreciation.
MoKee Rankin, too. came into his
melodramatic own as Bill Sykes. a fa
miliar role of liis to the older theater
goer, and one that shows him at his
violent best. Herbert Carr was rather
too hysterical as Fagin, and Miss Affie
McVioar was the victim of that silly
old tradition which contends that a
girl should p. 'y Oliver. On Oliver
hinges the sympathy and intrigue of
the play and there is no sense in deny
ing him even sex. The others did noth
ing notable, but played with commen
dable unanimity and sound. Any one
who cares for melodrama of the good
old hair-llftlng kind can have a thrill
ing time at this performance of "Oliver
Twist." ASHTON STEVENS.

REPUBLICAN
MASS-MEETING
AT WOODWARD'S
Henry T. Gage to Dis
cuss the Issues.
ARRANGEMENTS COMPLETED
SENATOR PERKINS WILL AD
DRESS THE AUDIENCE.
The Rally To-Morrow Night Is Ex
pected to Be One of the.
Largest Ever Held
Here.
All of the arrangements for the Repub
lican mass-meeting to be held to-morrow
night in Woodward's Pavilion have been
completed. The pavilion lias been draped
with bunting, American flags and shields,
and everything that might tend to tne
comfort of the thousands who will gather
to hear Henry T. Gage, the Republican
standard-bearer, and Senator George C.
Perkins discuss the issues of the cam
paign has been attended to by the State
Central Committee.
Between 400 and 500 of the most promi
nent Republicans of the city and State
have been invited to act aa vice-presidents
of the meeting. The only thing that now
worries the committee having charge of
the arrangements Is that Woodward's
Pavilion is not large enough to accommo
date all the people who are anxious to
hear the speakers of the evening. The
â vice-chairmen will be seated in the main
body of the hall, as the stage is too small
to seat them.
The meeting will be called to order by
Major McLaughlin, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee, who
will, after a brief address of welcome
introduce Jacob H. Ne# nominee for
Lieutenant Governor, as chairman of the
meeting. The principal speakers of the
evening will be Henry T. Gage and Sen
ator Perkins. The services of the Cali
fornia Glee Club and the Waterman Sis
ters have been secured to render several
popular campaign songs.
The Union League Drill Corns will make
us first public appearance that evening
i he members will march in a body to the
pavilion and there receive Candidates
Gage and Neff and Senator Perkins The
members will meet at the league rooms
at 7 o clock, and before going to the pa
vilion will serenade Gage, Neff and Per
kins.
Mr. Gage, who is at present doing ef
fective campaign work for the entire
ticket in the southern part of the State,
will arrive here on to-morrow morning's
train. A large number of his friends and
admirers will be on hand at the Oakland
mole to give him a hearty welcome.
SANTA CRUZ MUST PAY.
Decision of Judge de Haven That the
Water Bonds Are Valid and
Must Be Redeemed.
Judge de Haven, sitting yesterday as
a Circuit Judge, gave a decision against
the city of Santa Cruz In the case of Al
bert H. Wake to recover $23,100 and $50
Interest on each of 285" coupons. Judg
ment is against the city for $22,950, three
of the coupons not being the property
of the plaintiff, but assigned to him for
collection. The history of the case is
that the city of Santa Cruz issued in
April. IS<M, $.%0,000 of 5 per cent bonds to
tiefray the cost of building public water
works. The bonds were sold at 3 per
cent below par to Coffin & Stanton, and
delivered to Walter Stanton of the firm
without the payment of any money for
them whatever, the delivery being made
by Lieutenant Governor Jeter, at that
time de facto Mayor of the city, and the
Common Council.
The firm sold the bonds, pocketed the
money and wont Into insolvency, so that
the city was unable to collect* anything
from them. Thereupon the city repu
diated the bonds and issued a new series.
The defense in the present suit was
made on the ground that Jeter and the
Common Council being only de facto offi
cers; could not make any valid issue or
transfer of bonds, their successors hav
ing been elected and qualified at the time.
Judge de Haven decided that the acts
of de facto officers if performed in an
open and public manner and without op
position or obstruction were valid, and
that the bona fide purchaser is not re
quired to make any investigation beyond
the fact of the law and the face of the
bonds.
New Dog League Formed.
Representatives from the various kennel
clubs throughout the State met in the

THREW CARBOLIC ACID IN HER FACE.
Commercial Drummer Petty Adopted a Very Cruel
Way to Punish a Jealous Wife.
Mrs. W. D. Petty is young, quite prepossessing and intensely jealous.
It was her Jealousy that brought her Into an encounter with her husband
Wednesday night, from which she emerged with several splashes of carbolic
acid on her face and hands that cruelly burned Into her soft flesh.
Mrs. Petty is a canvasser for a photographic establishment on Market
street, and resides at 28 Eighth street. Her husband is a traveling sales
man, and is only in the city ,at Infrequent Intervals. Wednesday evening
Petty went home, but soon made an excuse to go downtown. Mrs. Petty
was not satisfied and was soon on the trail of her spouse. Hfs trail led to a
trystlng place where he met an inamorlta, whose identity is unknown to
Mrs. Petty; then out to the Cliff House, where the twain spent a joyous
evening. It was not so joyous for the wife. From the beach to Lagruna
and Greenwich streets Mrs. Petty was led, where the gay drummer bade
his companion a fond good-night.
That settled it. Mrs. Petty concluded it was her turn to "chip," so she
started in to "call him down good and hard." Petty "passed It upr" also
an uncorked bottle of carbolic acid, with flic contents of which he be
spattered his wife..
Petty ran down the street and Mrs. Petty called for help. Accidentally
a policeman was in the vicinity, and hearing the woman's cries went to
her assistance and sent her to the hospital. Drs. Bunwell and Meagher soon
alleviated her sufferings. Mrs. Petty's bodily injuries were not serious.
Her feelings, however, are badly lacerated, and she is trying to formulate
some plan by which she can balance accounts with her heartless spouse
without throwing carbolic acid.
IT IS NOT MIND,
BUT CHRISTIANITY
THE GREATEST FORCE IN MOD
ERN CIVILIZATION.
Lecture by Father Ramm for the
Benefit of the
Sisters.
It Is not merely intellect, not the train
ing of the mind for the acquisition of sal
able knowledge, that has made the world
what It is. The evolution of society has
been due to religious forces and to the
power of the church. This was the
thought upon which Rev. Father Charles
A. Ramm of St. Mary's Cathedral lec
tured last evening In the church which
is his home. His subject, as announced,
was "Jhe Voices of Modern Prophets,"
and in exploiting his theme he took
such writings as bear upon modern con
ditions and applied them to show that
mind is good, but faith is better; that
knowledge and education may lead a man
as far wrong if he nave a tendency to
ward evil as they will toward good if he
have a care for his soul.
The lecture was given for the benefit
of the Sisters of the Holy Family, and
they have for profits at least the seating
capacity of the church, for there was
hardly room for another on the floor of
the big edifice, and. as is the case with
most of the Catholic charities, the num
ber of those who attended but poorly
represented the amount oÂ£ money re
ceived.
Father Ramm opened his address with a
brief comment upon the conditions of the
world and particularly the United States
to-day, and the grave questions confront
ing the republic which are awaiting an
answer. Then he traced the evolution of
the Institutions of the present and the
causes which have made them what they
are, and proceeded to show that the de
velopment of society was the result of the
development of the individual; and the
individual, he declared, was developed by
religion, not intellect.
Social progress, he eaid, is not pri
marily intellectual, but moral and religi
ous; ft is the direct result of Christianity.
Christianity has taught the doctrines of
the equality of man and the salvation of
the soul nnd these have been the most
powerful factors for advancement.
He spoke of the attempt to establish a
"rational religion," one which rejects
anything not based upon pure reason,
but, he said, a rational religion is a
scientific Impossibility. A man In des
peration, deserted by everything and
everyone, finds comfort, not in the con
templation of the reasonable, but in the
supernaturaJ: the supernatural is his last
resort and no religion based on anything
but the supernatural can be a comfort
and a help to him; and this supernatural
religion, the speaker declared, is the only
true one.
Continuing on this line he claimed that
the Catholic was the only sect that had
adhered to the supernatural. The history
of the Protestant creeds, he said, has been
the gradual elimination of the supernatu
ral from the confessions of faith; the sub
stituting of reason for faith.
Reason, the education of the intellect,
he said, is merely the acquisition of sal
able knowledge. In itself It has no moral
character. It may make a man deep but
it does not change his tendencies. It will
make a good man better and an evil one
worse, ft makes a man not a Catholic or
a Christian, but a gentlemanâ a thing
good in Its way but not powerful opough
Fo contend with the passions and pride of
men. It is the harmonious combination of
the divine and the human within man
that is his greatest power for progress
and civilization.

There Is a cure for Drunkenness that has

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NHW YORK, Sept. 29.â The Burlington
August statement furnished a lever to-day to
carry prices upward, and this development waÂ»
the only factor of consequence bearing upon
the general situation. It is true that the in
dustrials, to a considerable extent, dominated
the market, but speculation showed a ten
dency to ignore fluctuations in this group. This
circumstance caused some favorable comment,
as did also the fact that the general list lapsed
Into dullness and showed comparative steadi
ness, when concerted attacks on the specialties
were made. London quotations Indicated a
more favorable disposition toward Americans
abroad, which was reflected in good buying
here throughout the day. Operations by the
bear faction were renewed in various direc
tions, with Manhattan looming to the front.
Tobacco, of course, was the most vulnerable
point, and soon yielded to 125. Covering of
ehorts put the price back to 12Sij. and inter
mediate fluctuations between that and the
close at 12SW were accompanied by violent dips.
This stock, generally speaking, showed a bet
ter tone and ended for the first time this week
'with a net advantage. Call money rates sagged
to 2% per cent late In the day. The action of
the Government In anticipating the November
Interest, coupled with early receipt of a large
amount of gold In transit, were responsible for
the decline in rates. Time money was also i
Quotably easier for the shorter period, and
some prime mercantile paper was discounted
at 3% per cent. Considerable pressure was con
centrated against Sugar as the day drew to a
close, but the stock soon recovered and ended
firm In common with the remainder of the list, J
which established slight net gains.
Bonds ruled fairly active, but irregular. Total
Bales, $1,953,000.
: Government bonds were a trifle easier, the 3s
reacting % per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 29.â The opening In wheat
rather indicated a bull market, although it was
difficult to find any explanation of the appar
ent inclination among traders to bu", beyond
the fact that Liverpool did not show the de
cline naturally looked for after yesterday's
break here. There were numerous fair-sized
buying orders at the start, with a scarcity of
offerings, the result being that December
opened at 63%@ 1 63-uc, yesterday's closing price,
with 64 cents offered almost Immediately. But
the tone of the market soon changed. North
western receipts were liberal. Receivers said
the country was responding more readily to
bids and indications favored a freer movement
of wheat. This sort of news weakened the con
fidence of buyers and resulted in a corres
ponding increase of offerings, under which prices
gradually declined, December getting down
to 63Vjc about an hour from the start. In the
meantime September had begun to show radi
cal weakness. Cash demand was reported poor
and primary- receipts, 1.655.000 buÃhels, were
400,000 bushels larger than a year ago. This
was partly offset by heavy clearances, which
were put at 925,000 bushels, and complaints of
the Russian wheat yield. But extreme weak
ness of outside cash markets, notably New
York, and attempts by dealers in that city to
resell wheat recently bought here, but not yet
shipped, started liquidation that brought the
price down with a ru*<h. all classes of sellers
coming into the market and the rapidity of the
decline bringing out stop orders both In Sep
tember and December. The latter option ral
lied to 63% con the heavy clearances, but the
selling which the slump in December started
brought the price down to 63c. The market
grew very heavy toward the close. Selling pres
sure was removed in a degree, but the weak
cash situation was very effectual in keeping
buyers away and prices kept declining to the
end. December closed at lc decline.
Corn was weak all day. Cat-h Inquiry was
fair, but not much business done. The market
closed %@%c lower.
Oats were influenced by wheat and corn,
closing Vi&Hc lower.
Provisions, in view of the weakness of the
grain markets, were surprisingly steady. Janu
ary pork closed 7%c higher; lard 2%c higher and
ribs unchanged.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Sept. 29.â The Journal of Com
merce cays: There Is a good and even aiv
active demand for California loose Muscatel
raisins for the last half of September and the
first half of October shipment, but we under
stand that few orders now going out to
the Coast are being confirmed. About every
thing available for September shipment. It Is
reported, has been sold, and none of the sell
ers are ready to accept orders for October
shipment after the Bth of that month, and
most of them. It is assorted, have already sold
all that they will be able to pack up to that
date. The reason why sellers on the Coast will
not accept orders for shipment after October
Bth is said to be that it is confidently expected
that the association will advance quotations
Vt cent per pound on October 9. There haa
been no official intimation of such an Intention
on the part of the association so far as we can
learn, but the information comes from a large
distributing firm whose relations with the heads
of the California syndicate are such as to en
title its assertion to consideration.

NOW TRYING
REV. DR. BRIGGS
Evidence Is Taken in
Secret.
CHURCH IS PROGRESSING
UPWORTH LEAGUE IS GROWING
VERY RAPIDLY,
Rev. Mr. Lamar Says He Fears Noth
ing From the Charges Brought
by Friends of Dr.
Briggs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 29.
The special jury that is engaged in the
trial of Rev. Dr. Briggs for immorality
held two sessions to-day while the routine
work of the M. E. Church South Confer
ence proceeded at Asbury Church.
Dr. D. M. Dubose, general secretary of
the Epworth League, presented his re
port to the conference, showing that dur
ing the year much material progress has
been made. The organ of the league and
the literary schemes which were in vogue
are rapidly increasing in popularity, and
both, are helping to advance its general
interest.
. There are at present senior league chap
ters. 4155; members, 156;975. Junior league
chapters, 450; members, 202,725. In addi
tion to these members there are about
,000 unchartered leaguers, making a
grand total of 352,725.
The Board of Missions reported as the
total result of four years' work that
51,077,383 had been received from all
sources. Ten missionaries have been
added to the number wurk.ng in foreign
fields, and 2177 new members have been
received. . . .
Eighteen -new parsonages, have been
built, and the work of church extension
has been very marked. â  â 
The following were elected as elders of
the church, the necessary vouchers for
eligibility having been tiled: Guv H.
Fraser, William Acton, E. T. Ramsey,
Lucius C. Smith, Stephen E. "Wilson, Jo
seph Bute, Robert S. Boyns and C. R.
Montgomery- On behalf of the Asburv
Church its pastor made a very flattering
report, showing that the many branches
of work were all flourishing and new
members being added.
Mrs. Bell Bennett, president of the
Home Mission Society, gave, an address
to-night on that ; branch of the work.
The prospects are that the trial of Rev.
Dr. R. J. Brlggs will occupy more time
than was anticipated at the opening. The
jury sits twice a day. .
- As yet it is quite uncertain what the
verdict will be, but It is whispered that
the testimony is very strong against Dr.
Briggs. The past history of. the accused
has been very thoroughly looked up, and
the testimony shows at what hotels he
stopped; .under what names he registered
and all the minute circumstances sur
rounding such occasions. Letters that he
wrote to the fairer sex are 'also brought
forward. , In fact, no stone is left un
turned to prove guilt or establish Inno
cence. In the event of an unfavorable ver
dict, Rev. Mr. Briggs will have an appeal
to the -general -conference, which will not
meet again until 1902. . v â 
â¢ At the conclusion of Dr. Briggs' trial the
charges against. Rev. Mr. Latnar, presid
ing elder of the San Francisco district,
will be heard in a similar manner. If Rev.
Mr. .Lafhar ia annoyed by the sensation
produced when Rev. J. E. Carpenter an
nounced that counter charges would "be
'preferred against him, he does not show
It in the least. He gracefully declines to
discuss the matter, and smiles indiffer
ently when the subject is broached;
while Dr. Carpenter appears to feel con
fident that the charges will prove seri
ous, though he, too, refrains with sealed
lips to utter a syllable to the press.
TAX LEVY CONFERENCE.
Girard and CuvelHer Ordinances Are
Not Favored.
OAKLAND, Sept. 29.â The Ordinance
and Judiciary Committee of the City
Council held a meeting to-night to con
sider the tax levy, which must be finally
fixed not later than next Monday. Some
time ago the City Council passed to print
an ordinance fixing the rate of taxation
at $1 21, out of which there was to be
provided something like $110,0<X) for im
provements in and around Lake Merritt.
The rates of taxation in the CuvelHer and
Girard ordinances would bo $1 27 and $1 15
respectively.
The $1 21 ordinance is now in print. To
night the committee decided to refer the
Girard and CuvelHer ordinances back to
the Council without recommendation.
The present indication is that the heavy
appropriations for Lake Merritt will
carry, and that the city will be crippled
badly during the present fiscal year.
Baptists' Annual Conference.
OAKLAND, Sept. 29.â The Central Bap
tist Association will hold its eighteenth

H;.|Hist Church, beginning next Tuesday.

nesday evening Rev. J. George Gibson of
Emanuel Baptist Church, San b rancisco,
will deliver the doctrinal sermon and on
Thursday morning Rev. C. M. Hill will
present his report on the state of religion
in the churches.
Mysterious Would-Be Bride.
OAKLAND. Sept. 29.â R. S. Williamson
of 817 Clay street has reported to Chief of
Police Fletcher that he believes he has
been buncoed by a mysterious young
woman, with whose charms he has be
come deeply smitten, but of whose abid
ing place he has no knowledge. To the
Chief he exhibited a batch of "warm let
ters," which indicate very much that Wil
liamson has in reality been a victim of a
(designing woman, such as often prey upon
" the unwary whom V^ey find advertising
for wives. The woman signs her letters
as "Miil.c-1 M. Starr" and "Mabel Starr
Water%" Williamson says he is out some
money on the deal and asks the police
to assist him in unraveling the mystery
and getting his money back.

OAKLAND, Bept 29.â Public Adminis

To Shake Off Surplus Flesh.
OAKLAND, Sept. 23uâ Dr. E. H. Woolsey
and A. Schilling, whose palatial homes
are on the shore of Lake Merritt, are
joint inventors of a novel machine in the
way of a jolter that will probably solve
the problem of reducing surplus flesh. Dr.
Woolsey had recommended "good, vigor
ous exercise" for his patient, Mr. Schil
ling, who immediately contrived a shak
ing machine-, the effect of which is re
markably similar to that experienced on
a freight train bumping over a rocky
road. The shaking is done by a system
of cogs. The motive power is electricity
and aside from the general shake-up the
patient can have an electric shock thrown
in. Dr. Woolsey and Mr. Schilling are
thinking of having their invention
patented.
Mr. Schilling says the machine can
shake off several pounds of fk-sh a day
and that the despised adipose tissue does
not return.
Manuel Stone Indicted.
-OAKLAND, Be|.l. 29.â The Grand Jury
late this afternoon tiled an indictment

to the correctness of which he had sworn,
and subsequently assigned to several
parties.

To Extend the Pavement.
To the Merchants' Association is due
more than to any other Influence the
credit for the Improved pavement now be
ing laid on Market street. Having se
cured a fine pavement from Second to
Sixth street, the members of the asso
ciation are now laboring to have the nw
pavement laid to City Hall avenue and
then to Van Ness avenue. The wishes
of the directors are set forth in the fol
lowing communication sent to the Super
visors yestÂ«Tday:
The marked improvement resulting from the
present repavement of Market street, from Sec
ond to Sixth streets, emphasizes the import
ance and value of continuing the repavement of
this main thoroughfare to City Hall avenue,
and If possible at least to Van Ness avenue.
The Merchants' Association therefore respect
fully requests your committee to approve and
recommend this desirable Improvement, and
exert your utmost endeavors to have the same
adopted by the honorable Board of Supervisors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FBIDAT, SEPTEMBER 30, 1898.
Oaklanders are not altogether
satisfied with the lack of op
portunity given to Its two fa
vorite actresses, who are with
the Modjeska company, now at
the Macdonough. Miss Maude
Morrell and Miss Grace Doro
thea Fisher have been some
months with Modjeska, and
much curiosity was shown
when it became known that
the company was coming to
Oakland. An effort was made
to induce the management to
produce "As You Like It," so
that Miss Fisher, -who has
been with Modjeska two years,
could show her friends what
she could accomplish. This re
quest was denied and the two
actresses are assigned to very
minor parts.
Mlsb Fisher is the daughter
of one of the oldest teachers in
the Oakland High School, who
died a year ago. Miss Mor
rell was engaged to a wealthy
young man, but, despite the
protests of her family, she
joined the company three
months ago. In speaking of
the two Oakland girls Count
Charles Bozenta, the husband
of Modjeska, said: "There Is
only one star in this company.
I am sure we can make some-
MORE BITUMEN
ON MARKET STREET"
STREET COMMITTEE FAVOSS
REPAYING TO VAN NESS.
Action on the Bush-Street Boulevard
Project Is to be Indefinitely
Postponed.
The Committee on Streets of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday awarded to P.
Swift a contract for furnishing lumber to
repair streets. Swift is the man who fig
ured before the Grand Jury in connection
with an alleged shortage of 350,000 feet of
lumber furnished the schools last year.
His bid this time for Oregon pine was
$1173 per 1000 feet, as against the $1S bid
of the Union Paving and Contracting
Company.
The petition of Market street property
owners asking that the bitumen pave
ment be extended from Sixth, street to
the City Hall was placed on lile, with the
Indorsement thut "the board- intends to
arrange for the repaying of Market street
from Sixth street to the westerly line of
Van Ness avenue." The same course was
followed with a similar petition from the
Merchants' Association.
The committee reported in favor of in
definite postponement of an ordinance de
claring Bush street, from Market street
to Central avenue, a boulevard.
MISSION ROCK IS NOT SOLD.
Premature Report of Its Purchase by
the Government for a Coal
ing Station.
The report of the purchase of Mission
Rock by the United States Government
to be used by it as a new naval station
is premature. The matter has not assum
ed form as yet, the report having but
slight foundation upon wnich to rest. The
Government is casting about lor a Buit
able location for drydocks and a coal
ing station, and, among other sites, its
agents inspected Mission Rock.
This rock has an area of about thirteen
acres and is about five hundred yards off
shore. It is situated in the bay, on a Und
with Second street.
A. Vorel. president of the California
Drydock Company, which owns the rock,
was surprised at the reputed sale of the
property.
"Late in August," said he yesterday, "a
representative of the Government called
upon me and asked if our property was
for sale. He came as the accredited rep
resentative of the United States and was
seeking suitable sites in this bay, at Hon
olulu, Samoa and elsewhere."
"We told him that our property could
be purchased, but the question of price
was not considered. The matter ended
there and this is the first mention thst
has been made of it. Ours was not tha
only site under consideration. The mat
ter of purchase would be a most com
plicated one, as Congress would, of ne
cessity, have to pass upon it. Nothing
could be done for some time."
The necessity of purchasing Mission
Rock is not apparent to shipping men
The Government owns both Goat Island
and Angel Island, either of which is avail
able.
THE STATE'S WAR CLAIM.
It Amounts to About $120,000, and
Will Be Presented by Adjutant
General Barrett.
Adjutant General Barrett, accompanied
by Lieutenant Colonel Burgin, inspector
of rifle practice of the National Guard
of California, will leave for Washington,
D. C, on Monday to present to the War
Department the claim of the State for
the expenses incurred in preparing for
the war with Spain. The claim amounts
in round figures to $120,000, and is for the
mobilization of troops in this city, and
for equipments furnished by the State.
The original claim was in excess of this
amount, but the Federal Government had
an offset for equipments previously fur
nished. There will be a settlement, and
when that is reached the State will have
a neat sum with which to proceed with
the work of reorganizing the National
Guard. The two officials expect to have
the whole matter settled within thirty
days, and they will then return to this
city.
Out of the money to be received the
State will be. called upon to pay about
$30,000 for transportation of troops from
various points, and $8000 more for other
expenses Incurred during the war.

SAN LEANDRO
HAS OBTAINED
ITS DESIRE
Deal Completed for a
Big Cannery.
ANNUAL FORTUNE IN WAGES
BIG BONUS AND SITE ARE FREE
LY DONATED.
Board of Trade Closes the Terms
With King, Morse & Co.
of San Fran- ,
cisco.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 29.
San Leandro wil soon be a busy manu
facturing center, for in a few weeks' time
work will begin on one of the largest
fruit canning establishments in the State.
This was decided upon at a meeting last
night between the representatives of a
San Francisco firm, the San Leandro
Board of Trade and various citizens who
have been interested for months In rais
ing a bonus to induce the new enterprise
to commence business.
Last evening Mr. Morse, of the firm of
King, Morse & Co. of San Francisco, met
the promoters of the enterprise and each
side was prepared to put forward its in
ducements. On behalf of San Leandro
a cash bonus of $30u0 was offered, in ad
dition to a whole block of land near the
depot for the cannery. This bonus is al
r.-ady in hand, having been collected dur
ing the past year, and as soon as ground
is broken the money will be handed over
to the firm of King, Morse & Co.
The canning company agrees to build
a cannery which will handle not less
than 200,000 cases of twenty-four cans
in a case each year. They agree that not
less than 50 cents shall be paid for local
labor for each case, which means that
$100,000 will be paid for labor each fall In
San Leandro.
This news has been received with much
rejoicing by the town. The movement to
procure a cannery was started about a
year ago by the Board of Trade, Rev.
Father McAvoy (since deceased), Key.
Barton J. Parry and other citizens. An
effort was made to raise a bonus of
$5000, but this was modified, and a large
site was donated. The bonus has been
subscribed by nearly everybody in town,
Including the school children. It was
Bt&rted because there were many vacant
houses in town, and it was realized that
there was no hope <>f the town's growth
except a manufactory could be obtained
which would supply work and income for
the people. Considering the siza of the
town the bonus is a large one.
A GREAT HOSPITAL.
To Be Located on Angol Island and
Erected at Onoe,
As published in The Call's dispatches
from Washington yesterday. It has been
decided by the War Department to erect
in the near future, upon Angel Island, a
general military hospital, fitted with the
most modern appliances, that will have
accommodations for 400 beds and supply
any demands that may be made upon the
medical department of this coast in any
future emergency that may arise.
Some time ago Colonel Middleton, the
chiet surgeon of this department, recom
mended the building of this hospital and
he decided that for climatic reasons Angel
Island would be the most deÃirable loca
tion. It was found by General Miller
that it would be absolutely necessary to
have this hospital, as the Post Hospital
could not begin to accommodate the sick,
and when the winter came on the garri
son troops would have to go in their bar
racks again, now being used as the Divi
sion Field Hospital. General Miller and
Colonel Middleton discussed the matter
and it was decided to recommend that a
general hospital be erected here and this
was done. The authority from the War
Department authorizing the erection of
the hospital is most gratifying to the offi
cers. The hospital will be for the use not
only of the soldiers returning from Hon
olulu and Manila, but from any point
within the department as well.
Yesterday General Merriam, Colonel
Middleton and Major Matthews went
over to Angel Island for the purpose of
looking over the ground with the view of
selecting the most desirable site for the
hospital. Work upon the building will be
commenced at once and it will be erected
by contract. It is the purpose of Colonel
Middleton to rush the hospital rapidly to
completion so as to be able to accommo
date the sick soldiers that will shortly be
returning from the Philippines and Hono
lulu. The hospital will he the largest of
its kind upon this coast, and every facility
known to modern science will he employ
ed to render it of the beÃt possible char
acter in its service.
The situation in the Seventh California
Regiment remains unchanged. Yesterday
the men were busy filing their applica
tions. This requires much work, as they
have to Lear their company commander's
indorsement and then have to pass
through the colonel's hands before being
forwarded to General Miller, and from
him they have to go to General Merriam.
Captain Alfonso, the adjutant of the regi
ment, had up to yesterday afternoon re
ceived the applications from four com
panies, and he expects them all to be in
by to-day. From the number so far re
ceived it is eveldent that nearly 90 per
cent of the men want to be mustered out.
When all the applications are in they
will go to General Merriam. who will then
make his recommendation to the War
Department. Until he makes this and it
is acted upon there remains nothing that
can be done by the men but to wait. In
the interim, however, the regiment is un
der orders to go to Manila, although
Captain Pratt proceeds with the work of
getting the regiment ready to be mustered
ou*.
By the order of Major General Merriam,
Major E. B. Moseley, surgeon, U. S. A.;
Captain C. B. Thompson, assistant quar
termaster, U. S. A., and Captain T. U.
Raymond, U. S. A., have been appointed
a board of officers for the purpose of in
specting vessels as to their suitability,
sanitary and otherwise, for use as trans
ports of United States troops.
Quartermaster Sergeant George J.
Smith, the son of Colonel Smith of the
Tennessee Regiment, has made applica
tion to Governor "Bob" Taylor of Ten
nessee to be appointed a second lieuten
ant in the regiment.
The following cablegram was received
here yesterday from Manila:
"Clayton Cunningham, reported dead. Is
in brigade hospital. He is rapdily recov
ering from a severe attack of sickness."
Three Regiments to Drill.
Colonel Loper of the Fifty-first lowa, Colonel
Smith of the First Tennessee and Colonel Funs
ton of the Twentieth Kansas Regiment met
yesterday afternoon and completed the pro
gramme for the military display and drill to
be given at the Presidio athletic grounds,
Baker street, on Saturday afternoon, for the
benefit of the work of the Army and Navy
Christian Commission. The band concert by
the three regimental bands will precede, the
drill, commencing at 1:30 o'clock, the drill at
2:30. Three battalions of 400 men each from
the three regiments will participate in the drill.
A picket line will he thrown out and there will
be Rome skirmishing and firing. Part of the
programme will savor of a sham battle. A
califthenlc exercise by the First Battalion of
the First Tennessee, Major A. F. Bayiess com
manding, will be presented, and the programme
will conclude with the three battalions march
ing in review. Reserved seats are under a

The work of Indorsing: the names on the
"slate" prepared by Bosses Phelan and
"Whispering" McNab was concluded last
night by the Democratic convention.
There was but a poor attendance outside
of the delegates when Chairman McGee
called the convention to order in B'Ne
B'rith Hall. It was given out during the
afternoon that the small break made in
the "slate" by ex-Senator Bart Burke of
Santa Cruz had been repaired, and that
there was no danger of any other breaks
being made In it. With no prospect of
there being a contest, the audience fell
off, as there was nothing interesting in
: having nominations made by Secretary
Walsh casting the ballot for the "slate"
candidate.
The first order of business after the
calling of the roll was the reading of the
report of the committee appointed to se
cure candidates for Supervisors who
were acceptable to Head Boss Phelan.
To Delegate George McGillivray was dele
gated the duty of presenting that part of
the slate. In order that no mistakes
might be made McGillivray was armed
with the following typewritten report:

thermore, our platform declares that the city

and not political principles, and has approved
the course of Mr. Laokmann, who has supported
our Mayor during his administration.

Ward, Stewart Menzies; Third Ward, Louis de

ton; Twelfth Ward, P. F. Butler.
When the name of Stewart Menzies was
read there were hisses and groans from
all parts of the hall.
Joseph Nougues moved that the report
of the committee be adopted and that the
secretary be instructed to cast the ballot
for the twelve candidates, whereupon
James L. Gallag-her, of the clan Galla
gher-Maguire, arose to register a protest.
He said that he was opposed to nominat
ing John Lackmann, a Republican from
the Sixth Ward. "I think that we ought
to be able to find a Democrat in the Sixth
\\ ard, said he, "and I want It under
stood that I don't want to vote for a Re
publican as a Democratic nominee."
Gallagher's speech caught the gallery
and he was cheered.
H. L. Rea also wanted to go on record.
He thought it best to leave the Sixth
wardw ard blank, if it was Impossible to find a
worthy Democrat for the place..
McGillivray stood loyally by the report.
He said that it was the desire of the
committee to secure a good Board of
bupervisors, and that inasmuch as Lack
mann had shown himself to be a faith
ful public servant in the present board
there was nothing out of the way In nom
inating him, although he was of opposite
political faith.
Chairman McGee suggested as a peace
measure that the report, excepting that
ado ted reterTing to the Sixth Ward, be
The gallery gods then entered a protest
They demanded that the roll be called
on the matter, and Gallagher voiced their
sentiments.
The chairman ruled that a motion to
adopt the report and have the secretary
cast the ballot for the twelve men named
if the report was adopted, was in order.
The roll was called, and when Max Pop
per and Sammy Braunhart voted aye
they were hissed and hooted. The motion
to adopt the report prevailed by a vote
of 53 ayes to 20 noes, and Secretary Walsh
cast the vote for the nominees.
Ex-Judge W. B. Cope, chairman of the
committee on Board of Education, re
ported that the following names had been
selected: Francis Pope, J. W. Maxwell
Dr. Alfred Eichler, William M. Cannon,
L. A. Sanderson, Charles P. Eells, D. F.
Keefe, A. A. Cavagnaro, Dr. P. J. Con
ran, H. M. Brandenstein, George li. Lent
and I. J. Lyons.
E. P. E. Troy presented a minority re
port, recommending that the name of j
J. W. Shanahan, a florist, be substituted I
for that of A. A. Cavagnaro. He explain
ed that he oposed Cavagnaro because a
brother of the candidate was on the com
mittee.
Chairman McGee and Max Popper said
that in justice to Delegate Cavagnaro It
was only right to state that when h*
heard his brother was an aspirant he
asked to be alllowed to resign from the
committee, in order that any charge of
partiality might not be brought. "I re
fused to accept the resignation," said
McGee in conclusion.
The majority report as presented was
adopted, and Secretary Walsh cast the
ballot for the entire board.
Charles P. Eels was then nominated to
fill the unexpired term In the School
Board.
Nominations for the Legislature being
next in order, L. Brannan inquired if it
was necessary to have the candidates
present. "I ask," said he, "because 1
have a candidate who is across the bay."
The gallery applauded.
The chairman assured him that If he
would stand sponsor for his candidate all
would be well.
Brannan gave a sigh of relief.
The legislative "slate" was then Intro
duced, and it went through with but few
slight hitches.
Lawrence Hoey was nominated from
the Twenty-Eighth District on motion of
J. D. Maxwell; Stephen B. Nolan from
the Twenty-ninth on motion of L. Bran
nan; Edward Hanrahan from the Thir
tieth on motion of M. C. Hassett.
When the Thirty-first District was
reached James P. Fitzgerald, Daniel S.
O'Brien and J. J. Mehegan were placed
in nomination.
C. J. Gallagher, who was sponsor for
Fitzgerald, opposed the nomination of
O'Brien. "His fight has been made from
a source that is not clean, " said Galla
gher, "and I feel it my duty to make that
fact known on the floor of this conven
tion. His fight has been made from a
sporting house at 8 Mason street, and if
necessary I will give the names of the
men who are back of him."
There was a storm of hisses from the
rear cf the hall, but Gallagher held his
ground "If you nominate O'Brien," he
shouted, "1 do not want to assume any
of the responsibility."
O'Brien, in response to repeated calls,
took the platform. He said that if he
was nominated and ejected, he would act
fairly and squarely.
The friends of Mehegan then clamored
for him to display his oratorical powers.
He boastfully took the stage. "That man
Gallagher promised to nominate me," said
he, "and to-night he throw me down for
Fitzgerald. All I've got to say is that I
hope you gentlemen will give me a fair
deal."
Candidate Fitzgerald was not present
and the roll was ordered called. O'Brien
received the nomination according to pro
gramme. The vote stood O'Brien 36, Me
hegan 24, Fitzgerald 9.
James M. Hanley and Stephen McGurk
were placed in nomination from the Thir
ty-second District. Hanley carried off the
prize by a vote of 49 to 17.
The following nominations were then
made without opposition: Thirty-third
District, Eugene D. Sullivan; Thirty
fourth, J. J. Crowley; Thirty-fifth, Steph
en A. Byrnes; Thirty-sixth, Edward I.
Coffey; Thirty-seventh, William E. White;
Thirty-eighth, Lester Jacobs; Thirty
ninth, Justice M. Wardell; Fortieth,
passed; Forty-first, Livingston Jenks;
Forty-second, Curtis Hillyer; Forty
fourth, Thomas G. Reilly; Forty-fifth,
William H. Jordan.
Joseph Nougues placed H. W. Sabln In
nomination for Assemblyman from the
Forty-third District, but as it was dis
covered that he was a Republican his
name was withdrawn.
The committee on vacancies was then
authorized to name the legislative candi
dates from the Fortieth and Forty-third
districts.
Barna McKlnne nominated John F.
Twigg for Senator from the Eighteenth
District. There was no opposition and
the secretary cast the ballot for Twlgg.
There was prospect of a contest in the
Twentieth District. P. J. McCormlck and
Henry C. Gesford were placed in nomi
nation. The Senatorial district com
prises the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-sixth
Assembly districts. McCormlck hails
from the Thirty-sixth and Gesford from
the Thirty-fourth District. It was as
serted on the floor that four years ago Jt
was agreed that inasmuch as the Sena
torial nomination went to the Thirty
fourth District, it would be given this
time to the Thirty-sixth District. When
it became apparent that unless the con
tract of four years ago was lived up to
there was a possibility of some "knifing"
being done on election day, Gesford with
drew and the secretary cast the ballot
for McCormick.
Emil Pohll nominated John A. Wright
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIX, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1898.
IRVING M. SCOTT
IS FOR PATTON
With characteristic unreliability the Examiner last Monday morn
ing stated that Irving M. Scott had been tendered the nomination for
Mayor by the Republicans, but that he had declined the honor as he
was going to support Mr. Phelan for the place. The statement was
worthy of its source, for there was no truth in it. Mr. Scott denies
it all and declares that what support he has is for Patton, the con
vention's choice. The publication was not seen by Mr. Scott until
his attention was called to it, but it caused some comment although
it was accorded little credence. Mr. Scott refutes it in these words:
"I knew nothing of the existence of the article until It was called to
my attention by J. D. Spreckels, and will say positively that there is no
truth in it. In the first place I was never approached as a candidate for
Mayor, and in the second place was never interviewed on the subject by
the Examiner. Mr. Phelan is a good friend of mihe, but I am a Republi
can, and when my party puts up such men as Patton and the other nom
inees I will give them all possible suport."
PLATFORM OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
The Republican party of San Francisco, in municipal, Judicial, educa
tional and legislative convention assembled, at the city and county of San
Francisco, this 29th day of September, 1898, reaffirms Its devotion to ReDub
llcan principles as expressed 'n the platforms of the party, national and
State. It accords indorsement to the patriotic administration of President
McKinley and to the Republican Congressmen of California who have sus
tained and upheld the nation's Executive in the successful prosecution of
the most humane war in history. To the nominees of the Republican State
Convention we pledge support, and as the basis of our claim to the suffrages
of all citizens who desire honesty and economy in municipal and legislative
affairs do hereby ordain and declare the following platform of principles:
We pledge the legislative nominees of this convention to vote for the
ratification of the new charter in the Legislature.
We favor the ownership by the municipality of all public utilities. We
pledge our nominee for Mayor and our nominees for the Board of Supervi
sors to that policy, in the belief that the best government is that which
imposes the least burden on the citizen. Until that result is accomplished
we pledge our nominees for Supervisors to fix a water rate which will net
to the Spring Valley Water Works ntn >t more than 5 per cent on Its capital
stock, provided that the operating and construction expenses of the corpora
tion be reduced to an amount that is fair, just and equitable. To that end
we pledge our said nominees to make a careful and methodical investiga
tion of the books of the company.
The charge for gas and electric light should be reduced and the quality
improved, and the city should have its lamps lighted every night in the
year. The lighting of the city streets constitutes a large and necessary
item of public expense. We favor legislation which will encourage compe
tion for this contract and secure to the public the maximum of efficient ser
vice at the minimum of expense. In this, as in other matters involving the
expenditure of public money, we are opposed to discrimination in the
award of public contracts. We are in favor of placing underground all elec
tric wires, and we pledge our nominees to secure these results.
The affairs of this municipality should be conducted upon the principles
of honesty and economy that prevail in private business. Conducted on
these principles a tax of one dollar per hundred dollars on an assessed val
uation of $350,000,000 will be amply sufficient properly to operate the mu
nicipal government. We therefore pledge our candidates for the office of
Supervisor to limit the annual tax levy to an amount not exceeding that
which will be produced by a tax of one dollar for every hundred dollars of
assessed valuation not exceeding $350,000,000.
We pledge our nominees for the Board of Supervisors, sitting as a
Board of Equalization, and our nominee for Assessor, to the levying of all
assessments upon an absolutely fair and equitable basis. We insist that
as between rich and poor, corporation and private < itizen, there shall be no
discrimination â that the burdens of government shall be borne in equal
proportion by all classes, and that in the assessment of corporate fran
chises care shall be taken to determine the reasonable value of such fran
chises in their relation to more tangible property vested In the corporations
assessed by deducting the value of the entire tangible property of such cor
porations from the market value of their stocks and bonds.
We pledge our nominee for Superintendent of Common Schools and our
nominees for members of the Board of Education to dispense with all un
necessary text books, and to make no unnecessary changes in text books.
We insist that all necessary supplies be furnished the pupils free of
charge; that the sanitary condition of our schools shall be improved and
the buildings modernized; that all contracts shall be subject to competi
tion after advertisement for public bids; and that the funds of the school
department shall be handled with the most rigid economy.
The salaries of teachers and other employes of the schools should be
promptly paid before any school indebtedness Is incurred on other accounts,
and our members of the Board of Education shall be pledged to set apart
each year a sufficient sum to pay the salaries of all teachers In the school
department, and such sums shall not be diverted for any other purpose.
We condemn the present Board of Supervisors for extending unneces
sarily the time for the erection of the Hall of Justice. We pledge our
nominees for the Board of Supervisors to grant no further extension of
time to the contractors. We demand that the work be completed immedi
ately, and if necessary the option be exercised by which the city may em
ploy new contractors.
The Republican party has always been the champion of labor and the
advocate of protection to the industrial classes. We pledge our nominees
in every department of the municipal government to the use of the Allied
Printing Trades Council label, as registered with the Secretary of State, on
all printing for municipal use.
A dally wage of not less than $2 for eight hours' work must be a stip
ulation in all contracts for public work. All nominees of this convention
shall stand pledged to this provision.
White labor and California material must be made terms of all public
franchises. No franchise shall be renewed earlier than one year before the
time fixed for its expiration. We pledge our legislative nominees to appro
priate legislation in the interests of white labor and for the annihilation of
Chinese competition.
We favor the conduct of the public pound on business principles, and
pledge our nominees for Supervisors to secure the best management possible
in the public interests.
We favor the improvement of our public streets and the extension of
street work as the growing needs of the city may demand. The public
streets should not be trammeled by unsightly obstructions, unutilized rolling
stock of railways or obsolete turn tables, which obstruct the public high
way and Interfere with its ordinary use.
We recommend the improvement of our sewerage system and the general
sanitary condition of the city, and pledge our Board of Supervisors to em
ploy its best efforts to that end.
We pledge our legislative nominees to the passage of a law providing that
all primary elections shall be held substantially in manner and form as a
general election.
The basic condition of ourgovernment and happiness is civil and religious
liberty. We therefore denounce the introduction of religion into politics, pro
claiming for all the religious freedom guaranteed by the constitution.
We favor legislation which will place the shorthand reporters In the Su
perior and Police courts on a salary not to exceed $200 a month, and re
duce the cost of transcribing to not more than 5 cents per folio.
We pledge our nominee for the office of County Clerk to limit the ex
penses of his office to $6000 per month, exclusive of his own salary fixed by
law.
We pledge our legislative nominees to the enactment of such legislation
as may be necessary to protect the Inhabitants of the city and county of San
Francisco against the manufacture and sale of adulterated foods.
We declare that in appointments to political offices no distinction should
be made as to creed or color, and further affirm thot the colored race de
serve and should receive proper recognition from the Republican party.
We commend the administration of our police and fire departments, and
pledge our nominee for Mayor and our nominees for the Board of Super
visors to the support of all measures calculated to increase the* efficiency
of these important branches of the government.
We pledge our nominee for Sheriff to turn all fees into the city and
county treasury.
We pledge our nominee for Recorder to pay not more than 10 cents per
folio for copying instruments.
We pledge our legislative nominees to propose and support legislation
for the reduction of the expenses of litigation and the cost of probate pro
ceedings and the reduction of commissions of cxc. tors and administrators,
and especially attorney's fees, in the matter of probate estates.
No person shall become the candidate of this convention unless he shall
wholly and without reservation indorse the principles of this platform.
Respectfully submitted, J. M. CHRETIEN,
Chairman of the Committee on Platform and Resolutions.
for Senator from the Twenty-second Dis
trict. There was no opposition and
Wright was declared the choice of the
convention.
R. Porter Ashe and Major Edwin Lewis
were placed In nomination for the Senate
for the Twenty-fourth District. Just as
the secretary was about to call the roll,
James V. Coleman, who placed Lewis In
nomination, arose and said that he had
been informed at that moment that
he had been imposed upon. "I under
stand," said he, "that Lewis has beÂ«m un
der arrest. If that is true, I wish to with
draw his nomination."
Lewis arose in the body of the conven
tion and said that he was the victim of
a cowardly and unwarranted attack. Un
der the circumstances he asked to with
draw his name.
Ashe was nominated and in accepting
a place on the ticket said that he hai
never before heard a word of evil con
cerning his former opponent.
A resolution vtas then introduced pledg
ing the legislative nominees to remedy
many of the annoyances of the present
nickel-in-the-slot telephone system by the
passage of adequate laws.
The convention then adjourned sine die,
after authorizing the chairman to appoint
the committees necessary under the pur
ity of election laws.
An Aged Suicide.
Emil Dannlels, an aged German living
at 310 Diamond street, committed suicide'
last night by means of gas and his body
was removed to the Morgue. Dannlels
was a coffee roaster employed by the
Guittard Coffee Mills. He had been a
sufferer from inflammatory rheumatism
since January and last night determined
to end his suffering. Waiting for his wife
to leave the house, he placed boards over
the bathtub and laying himself down
placed a rubber tube in his mouth and
turned on the gas. On his wife's return
at 10:30 p. m. she found him In that con
dition and hastily called In Dr. Bell, who
pronounced him dead.

ties, in next Sunday's Call.
