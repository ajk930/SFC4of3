ress. The course of the war has revealed
the necessity for guns less mobile bu: of
greater range, and these are being put
out abundantly."
After extolling the sea transports and
the ready response of the reserves, he de
clared that the Government had given the
generals an absolutely free hand; that the
war was "one in defense of our African
empire," and that, through good and evil
fortune, they would pursue it unswerv
ingly to the end, so that no such war
should ever be waged in South Africa
In conclusion Mr. Balfour ridiculed the
foreign prophecies that the dissolution of
the British empire was about to begin.
ANTI-BRITISH COALITION
IDEA IS VERY POPULAR
LONDON. . Jan. 9.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Daily News, in a dis
patch dealing at some length with the
questions of the seizures of German ves
sels by British warships, says:
"It cannot be denied that the idea of an
anti-British coalition is very* popular
here. Hopes are now placed in Russia.
Without being pessimistic, I must say
that the present juncture is extremely
critical. As matters stand, only the fact
that no power wishes to take the Initia
tive prevents such a coalition from being
brought about."
PASADENA MAN ON
LORD ROBERTS' STAFF
PASADENA, Jan. S.â Frederick R.
Burnham of this city, whose fame is ex
tended over all Europe and America be
cause of his record In South Africa, has
been appointed to the personal staff of
Lord Roberts, chief of the English forces
in the field against the Boers. The honor
Is no more than a Just recognition of
Burnham's ability and bravery as a
fighter. Burnham was Jameson's most
valued and able aid in the expedition
against the Matebeles In 1534, when Mate
beleland was opened up to the white peo
ple. Throughout the campaign Burnham
distinguished himself for his fighting
qualities.
Another remarkable achievement of his
was the exploration with a small party of
Americans of a part of Africa that had
never before been entered by whites.
Stanley had failed to penetrate from the
north, Livingstone had died In an at
tempt to enter from the east and a Ger
man party had been massacred in trying
to get In from the west. Burnham and
the party that he led succeeded in enter
ing from the south after great dangers
and hardships, and each member of the
party received a degree of honor for the
achievement. Burnham has been In
Alaska for the past year or two.

AN IMMENSE INCLOSURE
FOR BRITISH PRISONERS
BRUSSELS, Jan. 8. â A private letter from Pretoria says that
in order to accommodate prisoners of war who are crowding into
Pretoria, an immense inclosure has been constructed to the north of
the town in three long streets named Ladysmith, Kimberley and
Mafeking.
The Boers played an amusing trick on the English at Lady
smith. The latter think they, destroyed the Creusot cannon Long
Tom. The truth is that the Boers removed the cannon and substi
tuted the trunk of a tree, which was smashed by British shells.
The Foreign Office this evenlngauthor
lzed the following statement:
"Germany recognizes the right of search
within certain specific limits. Among the
points enumerated in the protest filed In
London Is one contending that England
has exceeded those limits. No answer has
yet been. received as to this protest."
On being asked whether it was correct
that joint action on the part of the pow
ers in the matter- of seizures was under
way a high official of the Foreign Office
replied that such action ought to be taken
If the -seizures did not cease. He admitted
that Russia was asking such joint action
in regard to the Interruption of telegrahp
lc communication with South Africa, but
he denied formally the report that Ger
many had sounded "Washington about the
feasibility of such joint action.
This dementi was subsequently corrob
orated upon Inquiry at the United States
embassy.
The foreign official ended the interview
with this significant assertion:
"Germany will not be content with the
mere liberation of the steamer General
and the other vessels seized by British
warships, but will demand indemnity In
those and similar cases."
The question of the seizures will come
up In the Reichstag as soon as Count
yon Bulow has expressed a willingness
to answer an Interpellation, which the
conservatives will plan possibly for the
opening day of the session. At any rate,
before the end of the week an extended
reply will be elicited from the Foreign
Secretary, who will review events from
the outset until those of more recent oc
currence. It Is also expected that he will
divulge the terms of the secret treaty
with Great Britain.
The Deutsche Tages Zeitung expects
that a turn in Germany's foreign policy
will date from the Interpellation and re
ply.
The excitement about the seizures Is in
tense throughout Germany. The colonials,
the pan-Germans and the anti-Semites are
pushing, a vigorous propaganda. Their
representatives are stumping the coun
try and preaching a war against Eng
land.
The Berlin Neuste Nachrlchten publish
es a communication advocating the seiz
ure of all British vessels In German ports
ajÂ» an act of revenare. Other cabers talk
about the "unbearable humiliation of the
Foreign Office."
At the same time the official organs and
a large section of the more influential pa
pers mildly continue to preach modera
tion. The Berliner Post says: "It be
hooves us to keep our sentiments In
check."
BALFOUR TALKS OF WAR
AND MAKES EXCUSES
LONDON, Jan. B.â Arthur J. Balfour,
First Lord of the Treasury, delivered his
annual address to his Manchester constit
uents this evening. An immense audience
gave him an enthusiastic reception. Mr.
Balfour contrasted the conditions of last
year, when the Fashoda incident had been
honorably closed and the peace conference
had been at The Hague, with those of to
day, when, he said. England had become
involved in the "greatest war of the gen
eration."
"It is true," he continued, "that the
Government knew the situation contained
elements of peril, but it is not true that
they regarded the war as anything like
inevitable. If H be asked why the Gov
ernment, knowing the Transvaal was in
creasing Its armaments, did not protest,
the melancholy reason rests in the Jame
son raid, which gave -the Transvaal a
chance to say it was arming, not for ag
gression, but for self-protection. Thus we
are criticized for doing too little by those
who a year ago attacked ua for doing too
much."
â¢ The speaker said he believed the events
which prevented mobilization last August
had done more good in uniting all parties
and all parts of the empire than if Great
Britain, and not the Transvaal, had issued
the ultimatum.
"Even the tactical misfortune at Lady
smith or the extent of the Boer Invasion
of British territory." said Mr. Balfour. "is
not such as need by itself frighten even
the most timid."
In defending the artillery equipment he
said: v j i '
"Do not believe your soldiers are sent
to the field with a worse gun than France
or Germany would use in similar circum
stances. The guns supplied to Sir George
White were Intended for a mobile force,
not for the defense of a beleaguered forÂ£

moment of storming. The gar
rison has been for some weeks
on short rations and has suffered
from disease. The chief point,
however, is the supply of am
munition at White's disposal.
Seventeen hours of almost con
tinual fighting must have made
heavy inroads upon his magazine
stores.
No force can stand unlimited
punishment, especially when
its rations begin to run short,
and it remains for Buller to
throw a great force across the
Tugela to relieve the town. If he
gives the Boers time to recover
from their unsuccessful attempt
to make a fresh attack upon
Ladysmith, the probabilities are
that the British prisoners in
Pretoria will have their number
doubled.
General Buller did not seize
the opportunity in the absence
of a great part of the Boer force
from his front to make a vigor
ous attack on either Colenso or
the positions upon his flanks. He
was content with a demonstra
tion, and shelled the Boer lines.
The British army of relief lost a
great opportunity, probably
through lack of transport and
water, which has compelled Bul
ler to divide his force and station
a large part at Estcourt, twenty
five miles from the front. It is
a question whether he will be al-
lowed another such chance. If he
is not, and the difficulties on the
Tugela prove insuperable, would
it not be best to transfer the
larger portion of it, possibly to
the west?
Such are some of the serious
problems which Commander-in-
Chief Roberts and Lord Kiteh 7
ener will have to face when they
set foot in South Africa to-day.
SOME GERMANS PREACH
WAR ON GREAT BRITAIN
BERLIN, Jan. B.â lt is not expected that
the speech from the throne at the open
ing of the Prussian diet will contain mat
ters of special Interest and the Reichstag
will reconvene without ceremony. From
an absolutely reliable source, however,
the correspondent of the Associated Press
learns that Emperor William will make
an important and sensational speech to
morrow night at the century festival of
the Berlin Technical High School. His
Majesty's remarks will be political, deal
ing especially with the naval question,
and will touch upon the sensation of the
hour, namely, the seizure of the German
vessels by British warships In South Af
rican waters.
In confirmation of the statement cabled
the other day that the Emperor has be
come thoroughly aroused over the con
tinuance of British action in this r.espect
the correspondent is Informed that he yes
terday told Geheimrath Mlessner, in tones
of deepest Indignation, what he had just
heard on the subject from Count yon
Bulow, adding: "Welche scmach."
Court circles here relate a number of
details showing .his Majesty's change of
mind as to Great Britain's policy and the
reports that England has sent out new
and more stringent instructions in refer
ence to searching vessels going to South
Africa are received everywhere with In
tense dissatisfaction.

great enthusiasm.
FURTHER DISASTER
WOULD BE DANGEROUS
NEW YORK, Jan. B.â A dispatch to the
Â¦World from London says: The panic pre
vailing here is vividly illustrated by the
following from the Observer, ordinarily
the staidest of Union journals:
"The Government has two courses open
to Itâ it could prepare for the coming
storm by landing their passengers and
replacing them with effective men, or
they can drift. Drift being the habitual
policy of the elderly and obese, that
course will probably be pursued In thl3
case. Further military disaster will ex
cite the public feeling to a revolutionary
height. The Queen will be left face to
face with her people and a committee of
public safety will become the only alter
native of the present Ministry. The ex
penditure of millions on guns 13 a panic
expenditure, as the appointments of Rob
erts and Kitchener were panic appoint
ments."
The above was written before French's
reverse was known, by which the Boers
completed their record by defeatins every
British general sent against them.
The situation undoubtedly Is very grave.
It Is rumored that Parliament will be
summoned before the end of tills month.

Once at the Point of the Bayonet, and
Joubert's Men Are Reported to Have
L-ost Heavily.
LONDON, Jan. B.â The War Office has published
the following bulletin from Genera! Buller:
"FRERE CAMP, Jan. B âThe following is from
White, dated 2P. M. yesterday : 'An attack was
commenced on my position, but vvss chiefly against
Caesar's Camp and Wagon Hill. The enemy was in
great strength, and has pushed the attack with the
greatest courage and energy. Some of the intrench
ments on Wagon Hill were three times taken by the
enemy and retaken by us. The attack continued until
7:30 P M. One point in our position was occupied by
the enemy the whoie day, but at dusk, in a very heavy
rainstorm, they were turned out of this position at
the point of the bayonet in a most gallant manner by
the Devons. led by Colonel Park. Colonel lan Hamil
ton commanded on Wagon Hill and rendered valuable
service. The troops have had a very trying time and
have behaved excellently. They are elated at the
service they hsve rendered the Queen.
" *The enemy were repulsed everywhere with heavy
loss, greatly exceeding that on my side, which will be
reported as soon as the lists are completed.* "
LONDON, Jan. 9. â After
long hours 01 suspense,
during which it might be
said that the British nation
found itseh facing one 01 the
most senous dangers which has
threatened the empire in a cen
tury, news arrived yesterday just
before 4 o'clock ""that General
White had succeeded in beating
oft the Boer attack and that
Ladysmith. with its 8000 defend
ers, was still safe.
The sigh of relief which went
up from the crowd gathered at
the War Office was echoed all
over the empire, where the
news was immediately flashed.
Yesterday opened gloomy
enough. All the momincr papers
commented upon the critical sit
nation of White, and Buller* 5 in
ability to succor him.
On the Stock Exchange at the
opening there was a downward
movement ot prices all around.
Stocks were freely offered, but
there was no disposition to buy.
Consols relapsed most, and
home railway securities fell ap
preciably in some cases.
At the War Oftice both lob
bies were thronged with anxious
callers seeking information as to
the position of Ladysmith. As
the afternoon wore on a rumor
got about that Ladvsmith had
surrendered. Although it was
"Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦. ..Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ :,Â¦ J
not given credence, still the re
port sent a shudder through the
waiting hundreds. But this feel
ing, akin to despair, gave place
to enthusiastic relief when the
official telegram chronicling the
victory of General White's forces
was posted.
All the wild rumors of the
morning melted into nothing as
White's cheering words, "Ene
my repulsed even-where," passed
from lip to lip.
According to the official re
port, which is the only news re
ceived so far,, the battle raged
for seventeen hours. It began at
a quarter to 2 o'clock Saturday
morning and did not end till
half-past 7 in the evening. Some
of the British intrenchments on
Wagon Hill were taken three
times by the Boers and as often
regained by the defenders.
One point of the British posi
tion, which General White does
not specify, was occupied by the
Boers during the whole day, but
at nightfall, under cover of a
heavy rainstorm, the Devonshire
Regiment succeeded in turning
them out at the point of the bay
onet. Possibly, as the Devon
shires were stationed at Help
makaan Hill, east of the camp, it
was that position that was the
scene of their exploit.
The chief Boer attacks were
directed at Caesar's Camp and
Wagon Hill, which were defend
ed by the Manchester Regiment
and Gordon Highlanders. Com
ing from the south, perhaps by
way of Fourcs Spruit, the Boers
assaulted three times vvitti the
greatest obstinacy and vigor,
sometimes obtaining a foothold,
and again falling back before the
British bayonet charge.
Meanwhile the latter, as com
mando after commando came up
from Colenso to reinforce the
fighting lines, gradually spread
over the whole circle of intrench
ments. including without doubt
the great Boer forts on Mount
Isimbuhvana and Lombard's
Kop. It is possible that Com
mandant Joubert had at least
20.000 men.
While White has obtained a
breathing spell, the seriousness
of his situation is by no means
lessened. In fact his position is
shown to be more critical than
the official reports and newspa
per dispatches had previously in
dicated.
The mere circumstance that
such an attack could be made
and pressed home with the ut
most determination proves that
the Boer forces in Natal have be
come something more than
groups of armed men; that
they are an army in a true sense,
ready to assaail as well as to de
fend.
To have recaptured the posi
tions from which they had been
ousted at the bayonet point is an
achievement that was not ex
pected of these Transvaal farm
ers.
Unless General Buller can
shortly give help, Ladysmith
garrison must succumb in the
end. There are no instances in
recent wars where a besieged
and surrounded force has suc
ceeded in extricating itself by its
own efforts.
As is well known, the British
positions at Ladysmith are by
nature weak. Both the town
and British camp are open to al
most every point, and the long
range guns of the Boers are able
to play with terrible effect upon
the defenders up to the actual
p^ce/five cents
Graphic Story of the Defeat of
General Buller While Trying
to Cross the Tugela River
and Advance to the Relief of
Ladysmith.
British Troops and Their Officers Alike Dis
played Unusual Bravery, but They Could
Neither Overcome Nor Withstand the
Annihilating Fusillades Fired by the
Hidden Boers.
LO>DOi\\ Jan. 9. â A rumor was current here last
night that General Buller had crossed the Tugela
River, captured twelve guns and was marching on
Ladysmith.
LONDON*. Jan. S.â The first account
giving an adequate explanation of
General Puller's defeat at the Tu
gela River cor/ies by mail from Ben
nett Burleigh, the Daily Tele
graph's correspondent. It appears that
the battle orders drawn up by General
Clery provided for the efficient support of
the artillery by Hart'?. Barton's and Dun
donald's brigade?. General Hart missed
his way. Lord Dundonaid failed to sup
port, and General Barton got part of his
forces in an untenable position. Colonel
Long with the artillery outpaced the es
cort of the guns and they were lost.
Briefly this seems to be the story of the
Tugela River. But through graphic col
umns there continually recurs the discov
ery of the unexpected intrenchments and
the awful fusillade from hidden Boers and
gallantry surh as has seldom marked
British "battle fields.
After describing how the British force
began their advance at daylight and how
the Boers left them absolutely unmolest
ed, the correspondent says:
"At 6:2u there suddenly burst an awful
crash cf Boer musketry upon the batter
ies and advancing Infantry. The rattle of
the Mausers swelled and was maintained
as one continuous roar. From the build
ings and lines of trenches south of the
river and from the river bank Itself the
Boers rired at our gunners and footmen
and from the trenches on the northern
side of the Tugela River and Fort Wylie
and elsewhere they sent out a hurricane
of leaden hail, and bullets venomously
rained on the ground in all directions,
raising puffs of dust and tearing through
the air with shrill sounds. Few have ever
seen so heavy and so deadly a fusillade,
but neither the British trunners nor the
infantry hesitated or winced. Cannon
were wheeled Into position, although
many of the horses and men were shot
down ere the maneuver was completed,
and our indomitable soldiers walked erect
and straight onward. Not even Rome in
her palmiest days ever possessed more
devoted soldiers. As the gladiators
marched proud and smiling to meet death,
so our soldiers, doomed to die, saluted,
and with alacrity stepped forward to do
their dutyâ 'Glory or the grave." Anglo-
Saxon soldiers always advance that way.
I asked an American who had seen war
fare in Cuba and Manila if his own coun
trymen generally did this, and he an-
swered, *Yes; It Is marvelous, but waste
ful.' Closer and closer walked the soldiers
to the Boer trenches until within 400 yards
of the nearest rifle pits. Then lying down
they returnee', the fire, but there waa lit
tle or nothing to aim at.
"The Irish Brigade had driven the Boers
to the north bank of the Tugela. They
found that the enemy had planted the
ground with barbed wire. Even In the
bed of the river barbed wire waa laid
down. Into the water went the Dublin
Inniskillens. Borderera and Connaughts.
but it waa found that the Boers had
dammed the river at the ford, where or
dinarily It was but knee-deep. They
strove to find the crossings, and many a
fine fellow with his weight of ammunition
and accouterraents was drowned. It was
a desperate and Ferious situation. The
attack on the right was making no pro
gress and the hearts of the men had
reached an apparent Impasse. But there
were furious and angry Irishmen who
had determined to get across somehow.
By dint of scrambling from rock to rock
and swimming a number won the other
Bide. Yet most of them found that they
had but passed across a winding spruit.
The Tugela still lay in front and all the
while the murderous fire of cannon and
Mauser crashed and comrades fell welter
ing in their blood.
"In the meanwhile Colonel Long had lost
his guns and Generals Buller and Clery
wlth their staffs and escorts had ridden to
the scene. The spouting hall of Iron and
lead sputtered and snapped and the dust
puffed more than ever. Lord Roberts' son.

â¢which have been submitted to him has

PTOMAINE POISONING
ON THE RIO JANEIRO
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.â Commissary
General Weston has received the reports
of the officers in charge of the Thirty
first Infantry while on board the trans
port Rio Janeiro upon the alleged poison
ing of the men through spoiled meats.
The report of the regimental surgeon, C.
W. Frye, has already been published to
the effect that the poisoning resulted
from fresh and not canned meat.
The other report Is from Lieutenant
Colonel Plummer. He states that 289 men
were made sick on October 22 and 23
after leaving Honolulu bound for Manila,
and one man died. This was the result of
ptomaine poisoning from the condition of
the fresh meat eaten. From the experi
ence, of the voyage.. Colonel Plummer rec
ommends that meat for the use of the
troops be packed by persons expert in
packing fresh . meats for long voyages;
also that officers of the quartermaster's
and commissary's "departments be occa
sionally sent on the transports to acquire
experience.
General Weston haa forwarded the re
ports to Major Baldwin, the commissary
in charge at San Francisco, to develop
other facts relative to the responsibility
for the condition of the meat

PILING UP EVIDENCE
TO CONVICT MOLINEUX
Expert After Expert Declares His
Hand Addressed the Poison
Package.
s NEW YORK. Jan. B.â The developments
In to-day's proceedings in the trial of
Roland B. Molineux for the murder of
Mrs. Katharine J. Adams brought the
hope that the prosecution would get
through with Its case by the end of the
present week. Three witnesses gave Im
portant testimony.
Morris Hermann, a member of the firm
In Newark for which Molineux was
superintendent, said that the firm of
MorriÃ Hermann & Co. went into the dry
color business In 1596 with Molineux as
superintendent, and it was upon the
latter's knowledge of dry colors and
chemical recipes that they started to
work. Evidence was Introduced last
week to show the ease with which
cyanide of mercury, the poison which is
alleged to iÂ»ave killed Mrs. Adams, could
be produced by a combination of dry
colors.
Edward B. Hay of Washington testi
fied as an expert In handwriting. He gave
it as his opinion that the letters signed
"Barnet" and "Cornish" and the ad
mitted handwritings were written by the
Bame person. .Â»ie also said that the ad
mitted handwritings and disputed writ-
Ings In the "Barnet" and "Cornish" let
ters and that of the poison package ad

that man was the prisoner at the bar
Alfred H. Graham, paying teller of "the
Bank of North America, testified to hav
ing received the writings In evidence in
the case and carefully studied them, -lie
paid that there was absolutely no doubt
in his mind that the address on the

JACKSON'S DAY
TALK OF BRYAN
Free Silver His Leading
Theme.
OMAHA, Jan. 8. â "Jackson's day" was
appropriately celebrated in Omaha to-day
by the Jacksonian Club. Three separate
functions were down on the programme
and each was a distinct success.
The first was an informal reception held
at club headquarters this afternoon, at
which AY. J. Bryan, Congressmen Car
mack of Tennessee, Overmeyer of Kan
sas and Weaver of lowa and several other
Democratic lights were the guests. Mr.
Bryan was the center of attraction, and
during the two hours the reception lasted
several hundred Democrats paid their re
spects. At 6 o'clock a dinner was ten
dered Mr. Bryan and a few other notables
at the Omaha Club.
At 9 o'clock to-night occurred the annual
banquet of the club In the parlors of tha
Paxton Hotel. Covers were laid for 300,
and there were no vacant places. Gilbert
M. Hitchcock, editor of the Omaha
World-Herald and late candidate for
United. States Senator, officiated as toajst
master.
The speech of the evening was Mr.
Brian's in response to the toast. "Our
Nation." As the well known Lincoln man
arose to respond he was greeted with
tumultuous applause, and when he re
sumed his seat another ovation was given
him. He spoke in part as follows:
"If Southern white men." said he, "have
falsified, election returns they have the
stronger. If not the better, reason that
they are acting upon the same law ot self
defense that Insulted and outraged human
nature resorts to for the protection of
homes and families from a race that sets
at defiance all moral restraints upon their
brutal desires."
This evil, he thought, would end only
when the United States had provided a
home, for the negro race suited to their
traits.
The House to-day ordered two investi
gations as a result of resolutions intro
duced by Representative Lentz of Ohio.
The first is to be an Investigation by the
Committee on Postofflces and Postroads
Into the charge that two Federal ap
pointees of the President â Postmaster
John C. Graham of Provo City, Utah, and
Postmaster Orson Smith of Logan. Utah â
are under indictment as polygamists. and
whether affidavits to that effect were on
file at the time of their appointment.
The other Is a general Investigation of the
Military Committee into the conduct of
General Merriam and the United States
army officers during the Wardner (Idaho)
riots and subsequent there to. The House
adjourned until Wednesday.
LAND ARRAYED
AGAINST CLARK
Battle for Mayor's Chair
in Sacramento.
RESTRAINING ORDER SECURED
POLICE READILY OBEY ORDERS
ISSUED BY CLARK.
Opposition Alleges a Violation of the
Purity of Elections Law and
Hopes to Deprive the Mayor-
Elect of His Chair.
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Jan. B.â Superior Judge
Johnson this evening granted a tempor
ary injunction restraining Mayor-elect
George H. Clark from Interfering with
tho duties of Mayor William Land. The
decision is a sensational climax to one of
the most remarkable days in the political
history of Sacramento. The Call this
morning told of the entrance of Mayor
Clark and a detachment of police into
the City Hall shortly after the midnight
hour and the ejectment from office of
Mayor Land and his attorney, Chauncey
11. Dunn.
The day hfÂ»d scarcely dawned when
Chief of Police Ash was directed by
Mayor Land to suspend Orncers Fisher
and Naghel from the police force for their
participation in his ejectment. Last night
Chief Ash informed the officers of the
tenor of the Mayor's message, but they
refused to surrender their stars. Every
official in the city government was in
turn notified by Mayor Land of his claim
that he was still the administrative head,
but Mayor Clark was not asleep by any
means. Bright and early he was at the
police station with his attorney, Hiram
W. Johnson, and notified Chief of Police
Ash that he should recognize him as the
Mayor and pay no heed to the emana
tions of Land. At noon to-day, after
Chief Ash had taken time to ascertain
where he was at, he announced that he
would recognize Clark as Mayor.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the newly
elected Board of Trustees, which forms a
co-ordinate branch of the municipal gov
ernment with the office of Mayor, met
and officially declared its recognition of
Clark as Mayor. While a message was
being read before the Trustees, in which
Mayor Clark spoke glowingly of the fu
ture of Sacramento under the joint ad
ministration of himself and the Trustees
complications were making in the Supe
rior Court four blocks away.
Scarcely had the Trustees entered upon
their session when Mayor Land filed a
suit in the Superior Court, contesting
Clark's right to hold office. The suit waÂ°
based upon section 3 of the purity of
elections law, which provides that no
candidate can claim office unless he has
filed within lifteÂ«n days a full statement
of his expense* of election. Land claims
that Clark did not hie this statement in
the time speched by law.
, T . he ftUns of the suit was immediately
followed by an application to Judge John
son for a temporary injunction restrain
'"c lark from occupying the rooms of
tho Mayor In the City Hall and from In
terfering with Mayor Land's full and free
exercise of the duties of Mayor. Long
and eloquently the lawyers pleaded on
both sides. Authorities In great numbers
were produced In support of the contend
ing pleas. Judge Johnson listened patient
ly until long after the Courthouse had
cjoHed for the night, and shortly before 8
o clock granted the temporary injunction
asked for.
Although the injunction Issued by Judge
Johnson is but temporary in character,
its effect has been to completely demoral
ize the city government. Mayor Clark
this afternoon sent in tne nomination of
John E. Sullivan as Chief of Police, but
It is not probable that the Board of Trus
tees will fly In the face of Judge John
son s decree and follow Its determination
formed this afternoon, of recognizing the
title of Mayor Clark and the validity of
his appointments.
Said Judge Johnson to The Call cor
respondent to-night: "The injunction'
which I issued to-night is only temporary I
Mayor Clark can come into my court i
with his attorneys on a few hours' notice i
and argue for its dissolution. To-day's i
motion was ex-parte, and there was no!
need for the presence of Clark's at
torneys, but they were present through
courtesy. Ten days Is the limit in which
the matter of dissolving an injunction
may be presented, but I assured coun- i
sel that I desired to facilitate an early
adjustment of the difficulties and would
be ready to open court on three or four â¢
hours notice to accommodate them " i
Exciting as were the incidents of to-day
the developments of to-morrow are be- I
ing awaited with no less intense interest
About three weeks ago William H Brad- '
ley. who was a captain of police here !
four years ago, brought suit as a citizen '
against the induction of Clark, alleging i
that he was guilty of violations of the !
purity of elections law, In having Incurred
campaign expenses not Included in his of- i
flclal statement. This suit has been set
for-hearing in the Superior Court to-mor
row and it promises, in viow of the pres
ent remarkable state of affairs, to have
great, significance and interest. It has
been said that Bradley would "fall down"
whenxhe moment for action arrived but
Bradley Insists that ho will not, and has
publicly ' declared that If the witnesses!
upon whom he relies fail to respond '
some one will be likely to go to the penl- ;
tentlary. It is said to-night to be prob
able that a judge from some outside!
county will be chosen to preside In the !
case. It was upon the pendency of this ;
action that Mayor Land based his claim
for the continuance in office. He has
been advised by his attorneys that It his
duty to refuse to surrender possession of
the office until his successor has filed all
statements reaulred by law. Mayor 1
WAR QUESTION

Pettigrew Arraigns the
Government.
ACCUSES IT OF TREACHERY
HIS CHARGES REPLIED TO BY
LODGE.
Senator Morgan, Discussing the Race
Problem, Deplores the Grant
ing of the Suffrage to
Negroes.
WASHINGTON. Jan. B.â During a dis
cussion to-day of a resolution of inquiry
offered by Pettlgrew of South Dakota,
some sensational statements were made
in the Senate regarding the attitude of
the United States toward the Filipino in
surgents. Pettigrew declared that the
Government had attacked Its allies, and
.thereby had been guilty of the grossest
treachery.
This statement was resented warmly by
Lodge of Massachusetts, who , declared
that .thla Government had done noth
ing of the. kind, and - that, not even
remotely, had. it recognized the so-called
Government of the Filipinos* t Â¦ ,_'.- S
Morgan (D.) of Alabama discussed at
length the race question in the South,
baaing his remarks * upon a resolution
offered by Prltchard (K.) of North Caro
lina. He. maintained that to attempt to
force the black race into social and po
litical equality with the white race was
only to clog the progress of all mankind.
Morgan said that no great body of white
people In the world could be expected to
qwletly accept a situation so distressing
and demoralizing as was created by negro
suffrage fn the South. Morgan declared
that in many places in the South thou
sands of negro votes, In doubtful coun
ties, with little concealment were bought
for $1 each. >
Those who studied the money Question in
IM'B foresaw the danger threatened by the gold
standard and i>ointeU out that its permanent
establishment would involve us in every tlnan
cial disturbance hovering in Europe. But
thinkers were for the most part blind to the
warning. What do we see now? Notwith
standing the increased production of Kold a
few victories won by the Boers in South.
Africa have alarmed the same bankers and
they are now fearing a panic unless England
is Immediately successful. Their financial In
terests In England's triumph Is so great that
many of them have silenced their sympathy
for a struggling republic and are hoping for
the extension of the authority of a Queen.
If such agitation results from war between
England and a little republic what must we
expect if war ever breuks between two (jold-
Fiar.dunl countries of the Hist class? With
out financial independence this nation cannot
be independent either In its foreign or domestic
jtolicy; yet the Republican party Is even now
preparing to chain America like a captive to
Europe's eplden chariot.
. ThoÂ«<e who studied the money question in
1896 also foresaw that the retirement of the
greenbacks was a part of the gold standard
plan. Many Republicans scouted at the Idea
and Â¦ the President avoided every mention of
the matter in his letter of acceptance.
But now the scheme is belns unfolded and
the financiers are to be empowered to expand
or contract the currency at their will and for
their own pecuniary' advantage.
. Those who studied the trust question In IS9Â«
foresaw that an administration placed In power
by the aid of great monopolies could not be
relied upon to destroy the trusts, but many
who.cotUd not be convinced by argument are
now ' being convinced by the growth and In
creased audacity of the private monopolies.
Any one who has read hlitory or under
stands-human nature knows that one race can
not cross an ocean and dominate another race
without -keeping an army ever present to hold
the conquered race in subjection, and yet the
Republican leaden) thought or pretended to
think, .that, an Imperial policy would be ac
cepted by the Filipinos with delight.
The decision of the nation on the Philippine
question will b* an epoch-making deolslon.
We stand at the parting of the ways and must
choose between the doctrine of republics and
the doctrine ot empires. At this supreme orUls
In' our nations history we may well recall the
words of Lowell:
"Once to every man and nation cornea the
moment to decide
In the strife of truth with falsehood for the
good or evil side.
Borne great cause, God'n new messlah, offer
ing each the bloom or blight.
Parts the goats upon the left hand and the
sheep upon the right.
And -the choice goes by forever 'twixt that
darkness and that light."

SANTO DOMINGO
MUST APOLOGIZE
The Frenc."i Government
Adds to Its Demands.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. !>.â
Besides the payment of installments of
money remaining due In the Boismare-
Caccavelli claims the French Government
has demanded an apology from Santo Do
mingo. An official dispatch to this effect,
was received by Secretary Hay to-day
from the American representative at
Santo Domingo.
The department has been advised of the
prospective arrival of a French squadron
in Dominican waters for the pur
pose of compelling Immediate compliance
with the French demands. Under orders
Issued several days ago, without refer
ence to the Frencn incident, the gunboat
Machias will return to Santo Domingo
from San Juan, whither she went for coal.
Upon his arrival about the middle of the
week at Santo Domingo Commander Lo
gan will consult with the American Min
ister for the protection of American in
terests.
The authorities have been advised that
the money r?quired to pay the French
claims has been collected by popular sub
scription, and the only remaining ques
tion to be settled is that. connected with
the demand for an apology. The Domini
can Government has not applied to the
United States to interfere, and there is no
disposition on tW part< of this Govern
ment to do so, though it Is learned that
the department went so far as to prepare
an instruction to Embassador Porter at
Paris, which; however, was not sent. It
is expected that the Jimlnes Government
will have to comply with the French de
mand and that the Incident will be settled
in a few days. The course of the new
Government is likely to have an important
effect upon its future, as it Is not be
lieved that the people will consent to
supine compliance. The authorities, how
ever, see no other way out of the diffi
culty for President Jimlnes.
The prospective prompt settlement of
the French claims has called the attention
of the authorities to the desirability of
securing action in American matters.
Minister Powell will receive in a few days
an Instruction to vigorously press the
Dominican Government for payment of
the remaining installment due in the Mc-
Kinley claim, and with the Machias In
the harbor the representation may be ef
fective. ; In view of the necessity of rais
ing money by popular subscription for the
payment of the French claims it is not
expected that immediate satisfaction will
be given, but dates will be specified upon
which the payments shall be made.
JIMINES RAISES THE
NECESSARY MONEY
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
atd. Copyrighted. 1300. by James Gordon
Bennett.
SANTO DOMINGO. Jan. B.â President
Jimlnes, who haa been at Macoris since
Saturday superintending the raising of
the popular subscription to pay the
Boismare-Caccavelli claim to the French
Government, returned this afternoon with
200,<>00 francs. The claim amounts to
isu.iXH) francs. As the popular subscrip
tion Is larger than the claim, the Do
minicans are rejoicing. The return of tho
President under such auspicious circum
stances was marked by patriotic enthu
siasm and a general flag display. The
French cruiser Cecille saluted the gun
boat on which President Jlminea re
turned. The gunboat answered the sa
lute. No steps have been taken by the
French Consul further than Intrusting
the case to Admiral Richard.
No disorders have occurred but popu
lar sentiment Is against apologizing to
France. People are urging the Govern
ment to prepare a Bystem of defense, as
the overthrow of the Government would
be menaced at the first evidence of weak
ness.
In raising the popular subscription
many ladies offered their Jewelry. One
Spanish and one Italian merchant have
Incurred the dislike of the people by their
failure to subscribe. Placards have been
printed urging a boycott of the two
firms.
The arrival of the French cruiser Ce
cllle created considerable excitement.
She reached Santo Domingo yesterday
afternoon, but did not salute as she en
tered the harbor.
The situation here Is tranquil and the
Government has urged the people to
show no hostility to France. It is re
ported that France will send two addi
tional warships to this island.

Way Back to Pasture.
MILL VALLEY. Jan. B.â The life of the
pof.ndmastor of Mill Valley Is not a bed
of roses. Yesterday Constable Manner
rounded up Manuel Gazerio's cows and in
stalled them in the pound. This morning
the barriers had disappeared as com
pletely as though the earth had swallowed
them. Brokpn railings plainly showed the
manner of their exit, and a little expert
tracking on the part of Magner led him
to Gazerjo's pasture, where the released
animals were peacefully grazing.
When taxed with the destruction of the
pound and the seizure of the cattle,
Gazerio protested against Impoundment in
general and this latest in particular. A
warrant was issued for his arrest this af
ternoon.

TO SAMOAN TREATY
Evidence That the Agreement Will
Not Be Confirmed Without a
Strugrerle.
WASHINGTON. Jan. B.â The Senate to
day took up the Samoan treaty in execu
tive pension, and after having it read from
the de=k Senator Davis, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, made a
brU'f statement explanatory of the pro
visions of the treaty. While the state

applicability of the language to the trans

WRECK NARROWLY AVERTED.
REDDING. Jan. B.â A. passenger train
wreck In tunnel No. 1, about a mile and
a half above Copley, was luckily averted
Sunday night. A tramp named IJaskln
son found the southern end of the tun
nel closed with earth from a landslide
He knew that the Portland and San
Francisco express, squth bound, was
nearly due. Once in the tunnel a terrible
loss of life was certain. He hurriedly re
treated from the tunnel, built a fife of
wood torn from the fences and awited
the arrival of the south-bound train. The
tramp did not know, however, that the
passenger was late, and that a special
train was to first pass over the track on
its way northward to Dunsmulr to get W
Yi. Mills of the land department of the
Southern Pacific to convey him to San
Francisco.
The southern approach to the tunnel Is
on a curve and Engineer Hollls was
within three car lengths of the obstruc
tion before he saw the mass of dirt and
rocks covering the track. Trowing on
the brakes and reversing the engine, he
and the fireman jumpr-d Just as the ob
struction was struck. They were unin
jured, but the engine was rendered use
less. Conductor Pierson sent the fireman
back to stop any north-bound train and
proceeded to walk northward to Kennet
to stop the passenger. Then the tramp
and the fire were discovered, l^asklnson
has been promised a reward. â¢ . . .

INVESTORS WANT
AN ACCOUNTING
Mother Lode Company
About to Disband.
TOO MANY ASSESSMENTS
GRAND JURY ASKED TO IrTAKK
AN INVESTIGATION.
Experts Say That Paying Ore Is in
Sight in one of the Mines, bat
the Stockholders Have
Lost Heart.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Jan. B.â Considerable excite
ment prevails here on account of the an
nouncement that the Tuolumne Mother
Lode and Development Company 13 about
to collapse for want of funds to carry on
its operations. The company Is composed
almost entirtly of Fresno people and has
Its principal j4ace of business in this city.
The number of stockholders Is over 200.
Their interest in the corporation varies
from $^0 to $100 i). The company first start
ed to develop the Sell mine in Tuolumne
County, but was compelled to shut down
on account of the dry season. In the
meantime they began to drill in what i*
known aÂ« Uig Oak mine No. 1. They have
now reached a point where experts claim
they will have to go only a hundred feat
deeper in order to Â«trike paying ore.
When it commenced operations the cor
poration had thousands of dollars con
tributed by the various stockholders.
Later the directors held a meeting and
bonded the mine to Captain Neville of the
Rawhide for $20,000 additional. A few
days ago they met again and levied an
assessment of 25 ctnta a share on tha
stockholders with the prospect of an
other levy of 50 cents in the near futura
in order to pay off the bonded indebted
ness.
The stockholders have refused to pay
the last assessment, declaring that it
amounts practically to confiscation. Of
the 42.000 shares 3_\u"0 are now delin
quent. The delinquent stockholders de
clare that they will not contribute an
other cent until the books of the company
have been experted and a thorough In
vestigation hail. They want to know what
the directors did with the money.
It is understood that the matter has
been placed In the hands of the Grand
Jury now In session. The directors of tha
company up to a few days ago were N.
W. Moodey, Jay Scott, H. E. Barnum. J.
L. Marble and Tom Brown.
Clark's attorneys, however, openly charge
Land with being at the back of Bradley'a
suit. His bond is J25.0U0 and last night
Mayor Clark offered him an indemnity
which he himself might select and
approve in the sum of $150,000 if he would
retire in favor of Clark.
If public opinion could utj sounded to
night It would unquestionnoly be found
In favor of Clark. Land was not a can
didate at the November election. Clark,
as the Republican nominee, ran against
R. D. Stephens, the Democratic nominee,
and by an immense majority defeated
him. Even those who opposed Clark's
candidacy were disposed to bow to the
will of the people and give Clark a fair
show to make for himsalf the record
which he had promised the taxpayers.
That he has been thwarted on the very
threshold of his career there can be no
doubt and disinterested citizens are de
ploring the present unfortunate circum
stances. It is argued that, even granted
that Mayor Clark has exceeded the limi
tations pet down by the purity of elections
law. he Is in no different position from
nine out of every ten candidates for office,
nor probably from those very officials
who are now urine: the law as an instru
ment to defeat the desires of the majority
of the voters of Sacramento.
T T p to a late hour to-nl^'ht the injunc
tion papers had not been served upon
Clark At to-r!srht's meeting of the Trus
tees the anointment of Sullivan by Mayor
Clark was rrcrived and the entire night
force of nnlire obeyed a summons or
Mayor Land to npnear at the session or
Trustees to keen order, but there was no
disturbance. The board declined to rec
ognize Lnnd as Mayor. The Injunction
of Judge Johnson will, of course, not take
effect until *ervod upon Clark.

his testimony in the Clark Â£erid.torlal case
before the Committee on Privileges ar.d
Elections to-day, lie was cross-examii:ed
by tx-Senator Faulkner. The examina
tion brought out the fact that Whitesiue,
as a member of the committee to inves
tigate the SUUe Capitol Committee, had
made a minority rejwrt charging corrup
tion, and he was iiiked it he had sug
gested to J. I. ilcCa.be that this minority

-I d:d."
â¢â¢Was this r.ot a position of falsehood?"
"I can't say as to that, but 1 had to

"What go you consider a lie?"
"1 consider it a misstatement to one
who has a right to kiiuw the truthâ not
to one who has no riglu to know it."
Whueside taid lie aid not set how any

"Have you received $05,0 X) for this pre
tended exposure?" asked Faulkner.
"1 have not received $25,000 or any sum
for that service." the witness replied.
Relating to his conversation neld with
Senator Clark prior to the iatter's elec
tion, he said he was positive that Clark
liimself had said, among other things,
that State Senator Anderson could not be
influenced with mone\ like some of the
other members an<i that this statement
was not made by Welloome. as appeared
In the printed report of his testimony be
fore the Gra:id Jury of Lewis and Clark
County.
The witness paid the money to pay for
the present prosecution had been raised
by subscription, ar.d he understood that
Daly wa> one of the subscribers to the
fund. The cros=f?-examir.a.tion further
brerarfat out that the witness had no per
sonal knowledge of bribery in the case
of the three inejnbers iof the Assembly
who had been referred to.
Attempts were mad^t to bring out points
of difference between the witness" state
ments now and those made before the
Grand Jury. One of the questions brought
out a now statement from Whiteside that
his knowledge that bribery was going oa
was confirmed when a party to the trans
action took from his pocket a roll of bills
and eald:
"That's what we do busings wUh."
The cross-examination sought to bring
out the circumstances of an alleged meet
ing between the witness and an election
official who hfld the ballots in the election
in which Whiteside had participated. The
wltr.es? was asked If he had not offered
$1000 for the ballots. WhitoMde denied
that this had occurred and asserted that
he had proof to show that a person ha<3
b**n paid to make such a statement
against him. He said that a prnc ecm j on
institute against him in this connection
was due to prejudice and was inspired by
one of Clark's associates.
At one point Pettus r.f the committee
objected to having the witness "ba<;gpred"
by counsel.
Ex-Senator Edmunds of counsel ag'aln'st
Clark paid many of the questions had
be^-n imprcpr-r. but that they were not ob

Whiteside then went over the circum
rtances <-Â»f his being authorized to offer
$5000 tn each of two memtiPr?. with $500
down, en condition that their vot^s would
be fortli<-orains: if drMred. He was closely

BARKENTINE SUNK
BY A COLLISION
The William Carson Lost
Off Honolulu.
HONOLULU. Dec, SO.-The barkentlne
William Carson. Captain J. Piltz. w'th
coal from Newcastle, and the Island
steamer Claudine met in collision off Dia
mond Head on the night of the 27th inst.
The Claudine struck the Carson bow on
and the sailing vessel commenced to sink
In a few moments. When the Claudine
left her It was thought the wreck had
gone to the bottom, but the next morning
the hulk was recovered by tugs.
Both vessels had all their lights burn
ing. The steamer is said to have changed
her course to head directly for the bark
entlne just before the collision. Five min
utes later she left with the captain and
his wite and the crew of the sunken ves
eel, bringing them ashore.
Nothing was saved from the William
Carson. The crew had barely time to get
aboard the Claudine before the barken
tlne went on her beam ends. Mrs. Piltz,
with a rope around her waist, was as
sisted from the deck of the Carson to the
Claudine while the water arose around
the cabin of the Carson. She had to step
from the roof of the cabin Into several
feet of water on deck. The crew made
the same passage, leaving all their belong
ings behind.
The William Carson was less than a
year old. She was launched at Eureka,
CaJ., on the 3d of last June. From thera
she went to Port Blakeley, taking lumber
from that port to Australia. She left
Newcastle fifty-three days ago with 1350
tons of coal and a crew of thirteen. The
trip was an unlucky one from the start.
Fearful storms were encountered soon
after leaving Newcastle, and on the ninth
day out one of the men was washed over
board.
The unfortunate vessel arrived oft Koko
D. Knight. 51000; Albert J. Knight, a
brother, and his wife, 53000 each; Emily
Camp, a niece, $3000; Abbie Swift, niece,
J1000; Thomas Severson, Charles Peterson,

and Yuba City Street Railway stock; the
Ladies' Relief Society, Catholic Ladies'
Relief Society. Marysvllle Benevolent. As
sociation. $1000 each: A. C. Blngham. his
executor, $SOOO as compensation. A. C.
Blngham and Mary A. Knight are ap
pointed executors without bonds. The es
tate is estimated at $150,000.
BURNED IN HIS CABIN.
Body of Nelson Delavergne Found in
the Ruins of His Home.
SAN JOSE, Jan. B.â At 4:30 yesterday
morning the small cabin occupied by Nel
son Delavergne, an expressman, on Bird
avenue, was burned to the ground. When
a search of the ruins was afterward made
the charred trunk of Delavergne was
found. Death was probably due to acci
dent.
Delavergne had had many hemorrhages
of the lungs lately and on Saturday even-
Ing he had complained of feeling ill. As
traces of blood were found leading from
the cabin to the barn, it is supposed De
lavergne while attending to his horses
in the morning had a hemorrhage: that
he stagggered back to the cabin, over
turned a lamp In falling, and so set fire
to the building. He was unmarried and
64 years of age. His only relative is a
sister in the East.
Water Carnival Planned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO OALL, TUESDAY, JAISTUARY 9, 1900.
Head Just after dark. Captain Plltz de
cided that It was too late to approach the
harbor and sailed slowly along the coast.
Intending to remain outside and signal
for a tug In the morning. He was quite
familiar with the coast, having been herÂ©
before many times. A few minutes be
fore the disaster he remarked to his wife,
who was on deck with him, that he would
have to stay up all night and loo* ofter
the vessel, being so near land. Mrs. Pi'.ts
went below to make coffee, and the Clau
dine hove Into sight before she returned.
The crew of the William Carson claims
an error was made by the navigator of
the steamer. The captain of the Clau
dine has yet to be heard from. The latter
almost passed the barkentlne It Is said,
and then suddenly changed his vessel's
course.
"Where are you heading for?" yelled
Captain Piltz as he saw the danger.
It was too late to stop the Claudine.
She struck the sailing vessel hard on Urn
starboard bow and the Carson began to
fill. The anchor chains of the two ves
sels were entangled. Boats from the
Claudine were lowered at once and thf
crew of the William Carson was called
up from below. There was a heavy swell
and the rescue work was no easy mat
ter. The captain and crew of the Clau
dine did very pood work at this stas?e
and by the time the William Carson*
decks began to go under all the endan
gered persons were In safety.
Those who were brought ashore from
the William Carson after her collision
with the Claudine were not far wrong
when they reported that she had gone
stralsht to the bottom. The sailing ves
sel sunk so far that her hull was com
pletely hidden from view. Four yards
sticking out of the water and the rough
nesa of the waves as they passed above
the hull were all that could be seen when
the tug Eleu found her.

3prevail the board should propose an amend
ment to the charter exempting all munici
pal bonds of San Francisco from local taxa
tion. The charter now exempts bonds is
sued for the purpose of acquiring public util
ities under that instrument.
It will be the duty of the Board of Public
"Works to construct buildings and sewers
and the duty of the Park "Commissioners to
lay out. Improve and maintain the lands
acquired for park purposes.
Water and Light.
It Is the duty of the Supervisors in the
month of February to fix water rates for
consumers of water in San Francisco and
also the rate for gas and electric ltirhttnir
to be paid by private consumers and by
the city for the Illumination of streets ami
public buildings.. The decisions of YhV courts
In recent years have established thla doc
trine: That the companies are entitled to\
â¢'fair return uson the reasonable value o*
their property at the time it is belne useÂ«l
for the public." They should recefve a fair

Mayor should not interfere unless there be.
an abandonment on the part of the commis
sions of Fuch policy or If flagrant abuses
creep Into the administration. The Mayor
comes from the people and must speak for
them, and his office will he Judged not
Â«rion* by the personnel of his appointees,
but by the results of their work. Next to
the fixing: of responsibility and the estab
lishment of home rule the civil service pro
visions of the new organic law make the
moet radical departure from the old and
condemned methods, and these provisions
should be strictly enforced.
Board of Supervisors.
The most important functions of the
Beard of Supervisors will be the fixing of
the tax rate and the apportionment of
funds, which when once apportioned are
Inviolable; the enactment of orders impos
ing licenses for police and revenue pur
poses, the equalization of assessments, the
fixing of rates for water and ' artificial
light, and the granting of franchises and
privileges.
In the appropriation of money you. are
closely associated with every department of
the government. In the great department
of public works your co-operation is par
ticularly required. because under the
charter (Sec. 9, Ch. 1. Art. VI) the Board
of Public Work* shall have charge, super
intendence and control of all public streets,
sewers and public buildings and . the con
struction, repair and cleaning thereof under
"such ordinances as may from time to tlms
be adopted by the Board of Supervisors."
I have, therefore, by your authority,
named committees which will .correspond
with every department of the government,
and it Is expected of the committees . that
tney make a special study of the several
dfpartments. becausa under the charter
(Art. Ill) the appropriations once segre
gated cannot be changed, nor can more
than a one-twelfth part of the appropria
tion In any one month during tbe fiscal
AFTER years of discussion, agitation and effort, San Francisco passed
yesterday from one form of government to another. The change, which
is revolntionary, was marked, with one exception, by scenes of order.
That exception transformed the City Hall for a time into a hotbed of riot
in which angry contestants for office fought like beasts for possession.
Heads were smashed, furniture was demolished, a man fell wounded by a
bullet fired with murderous accuracy, and the mob was dispersed by the
police. The disgraceful scene was the outcome of E. I. Sheehan's effort to
prevent J. Harry Scott from assuming ofiice as Tax Collector, and in the end
Sheehan waÂ« )'orced to retire and await the action of ttie courts.
The other remarkable incident of the day was the attitude of Mayor
Phelan, in which he showed that he had not only dishonored the provisions
of the purity law but had forced upon his Board of Fire Commissioners the
unenviable task of violating the very fundamental provisions of the charter it
self. It is notorious that Mayor Phelan made a promise to the Fire Depart
ment before his election not to disturb its members. It is also asserted that
he promised other influences to give J. C. Gorman the position held by
George Maxwell.
In both promises the Mayor violated the purity law, and when the Fire
Commissioner? appointed Gorman yesterday they violated a fundamental
provision of the charter, which declares that in the reorganization of the Fire
Department appointments shall be made from the oflicers and members con
stituting the service when the charter goes into effect. It is an incident of
the greatest local interest that on the first day of the operation of the char
ter, for which Mayor Phelan labored so ostentatiously, he should violate
one of the raoft vital provisions of the new organic law. The revolution as
it was accomplished in all departments yesterday is given in what follows.
and economical expenditure of public
money through various â¢ boards and
commissions. The commissioners are re
sponsible to him and he is responsible to
the people. Therefore there should be loyal
co-operation between the two branches of
the government an.l between the eommis-
Flor.s and the Mayor. The commissions
have to express in their public actions the
policy for which the Mayor stands, as ex
emplified in the platform of the party on
which he was elected. With this com
plete understanding the commissions
should be allowed a wide discretion in put-
pie is to allow the water company 3 per cent
Interest on Its Investment, whose value
should be first determined, and in the mat
ter of the price of gas a rate not exceeding
|1 35 per thousand cubic feet shall be
charged. During the year the principle of
fixing the. gas rate by the Board of Super
visors has been for the first time estab
lished In this city when a reduction was
marie from $1 75 to Jl EO per thousand. Com
petitive electric companies regulate in most
districts the price of electric lighting. .
Assessments.
In the month nf July the Sapervi9Â»>rÂ» *it
as a Hoard of Canalization, when they can
raise or lower th*> assessment roll or any
item thereof. The administration of Dr.
Washington Do-iste of the Assessor's office
has been such that warrants onÂ»>- words of
commendation, an.l hence your duties in this
respect will be light. However, there should
be a full knowWse of the facts and perfect
co-operation between this important public
officer and the membera of the board
Geary-Street Franchise.
Tour term of office will expire January Â«
1902. and I regret that the Geary-street. Park
and Ocean franchise does not expire unt:l
November 6. tKS, ami. as no action can l>Â«
taken on franchises under the charter until
within one year of their expiration, this
boani unfortunately cannot ilispose of that
valuable property, which should belong ta
the city and be operated as a model rail
road In the public interest. However I de
sire by this reference to remind the 'public
of their powers and duties in thÂ» premises.
Street Railroad Charges.
A movement for the reduction of farea
has been agitated, and the only apparent
obstacle in the way is the objections o"
some of the poorer railroals, namely, the
Union-street and the .San Francisco' ami
San Mateo, but I recommend to this board
a careful consideration of the subject.
Other cities have low 'ares for working
men and school children during certain
hours of the Jay. and in building up a city
it is more important to have low rates
granted by these companies or fixed by the
Board of Supervisors than to i.-npose up-^n
them a high license and franchise tax.
But If for any reason low fares car.not be
secured, the public revenue can be In
creased by the application of that excellent
rule adopted by the Awiwjor and approved
by the Supreme Court in the case of the
San Jose Gas Company vs. January. For
if the profits of the (.-omoanies are great
and yield a higher rate of Interest upon
their actual Investment than Is JUst an'l
reasonable, the stock and b^nds of the com
pany will sell for a higher price In th*
market and the market price of the stools
and bonds Is the basis upon which the As
sessor makes his valuation of the fran
chise.
The same reasons apply to the telephone
â¢ervlce, which should contribute more in
license taxation to the city and concede to
the people lower rates. There seenoa |o> be
no authority under the charter to fix tele
phone rates, and therefore it is the duty qf
the board to see that the companies pa"
taxes In proportion to the valuÂ» of their
property. The whole spirit of taxation is
Dot to oppress industry, but to distribute
the burdens of government equally. It is
notorious that the large corporations in :hÂ»
past have evaded their just contribution to
the municipal revenue*.
The change In the government Is In the
nature of a revolution. The- administration
is charged with the duty by the people of
driving- out old abuses an<l establishing
the government upon a business bas!3.
Board of Public "Works.
The Board of Public "Works has dis
posed of and absorbed the Street and Engi
neer's Departments. The office at gas in
ipector should be provided for. Under a
recent ordinance the citizens can hare
their metsrs tested by the payment of a
small fee of $1. to be refunded In case the
meter complained of lÂ» running more than
5 per cent fast. A diligent gas Inspector
can save the city many times his salary In
the regulation of public lights In bulldtnxs
and streets. The Board of Public Work.9
is required by the charter to appoint an er
flcient ensineer with the greet purpose In
view of providing, first, a water supply tor
San Francisco; secondly, a public fighting
plant and afterward other public utilities.
Within one year from this day "the Super
visors must procure through the City En
gineer plan 3 and estimates of the actual
cost of the orlsina! construction and com
pletion by the city and county of water
works, gas works, electric light works,
steam, water or electric power worts, tele
phone lines, street railroads and such other
utilities as the Supervisors or the people by
petition to the board may designate."
The Supervisors must also procure and
place on file plans and estimates of tha
cost of obtaining from all the several avail
able sources a sufficient and permanent
supply of water, as preliminary to lacurrtnu
municipal indebtedness for Its acquisition.
After Â«uch plans and estimates are pro
cured the Supervisors, at as early â¢> date
as they deem best for the interests of the
city, shall enter Into negotiations for the
permanent acquisition of such utilities as
they may regard most Important to be rtrst
acquired, and to submit the samt- to the
people at a special election; but before pro
viding for original construction or con
demnation of public utilities, the Supervis
ors must consider offers frr tha sale of exist
ing utilities In order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the game, If
they so prefer, as an alternative proposi
tion.
The Board of Public Works, havin* Jur
isdiction over boulevards, should lay out
one along the city front and the bay â¢hers
to the Cliff House, and estimate the cost
of a better bridge across Channel street,
connecting the Potrero â a section. of the city
which deserves special consideration on ac
count of its productive activities â with the
city proper. Perhaps a tunnel under Chan
nel street, as urui^r the Chicago River, will
facilitate traffic.
When ot;r harbor shall have been re
covered from the State the Board of Public
Works will have the construction of docks
and w*arves. and the bay shore to thy*
county line should bÂ» regarded hereafter
from the point of view of lhÂ» extension of
our harbor facilities, ar.d the Government
should be interested to m&ke a breakwater
at North Beach, whither the seawall will
be ultimately extended.
Police Department. " :: :",.â¢
The Police Department will be reorgan
ized and will be more accountable to tha
people than in the past. One of the reasons
which gave r!s? to the charter movement
wasâ a3 is well known â the perpetual ten
ure of office enjoyed by the Police Commis
sioners, and the appointing power possessed
by the Governor; hence, the police were la
dependent of the people.
Chinatown, where prostitution and gam
bling In violation of law cap. enly exi3t
with the connivance of the police, has been
a field of corruption, demoralizing to the
department. It exercises as malign an In
fluence over the police as diii tne quasi
public corporations over the Supervisors in
the past; but as the city found men to
withstand the blandishments of the cor
porations, so must we ftjul men who win
do their duty in Chinatown.
Public gambling is a great evil leading
to poverty, disgrace, defalcation and deatb.
which the records of this city abundantly
prove, and Its practice should be u.scounte
nanced and suypressed.
The police should detect crime and pun
ish offenders for their salaries, and not for
special rewards.
Fire Department.
The Fire Department has reached a hlith
degree of efficiency under Chief Sullivan,
but it should not be suffered for one mo
ment to become a political machine in tha
interests of any faction, organization or
party. If the men know that they will be
protected so long as they do their duty,
for which they are employed and paid by
the city, they will welcome the new con
ditions. No loneer will it be necessary for
them to takÂ» orders from anybody, except
in the line of their duty. Section 32 of
article XVI of the new charter requires
the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners
to remove any officer or employe who shall
become involved in rartisan strife, or pay
an assessment for political purposes; and
these boards expose themselves to removal
If they refuse to enforce this section.
The object of the charter Is to remove
these two Important departments of tha
city government from active participation
in political movements, on account of tha
great danger of their betns controlled in
special interests. Then men are left free
to vote as they please, and in the spirit of
the charter thÂ« taint of corrupt political
bosslsm must be removed from the admin
istration of the affairs of the Police and
Fire departments of i^an Francisco.
Health Department.
The Board of Health, under the new la.tr
consists of five members and th<Â» President
of the Board of Public Works and tha
Chief of Police, so there will be full co
operation between thes? dei>artmenta la
the? enforcement of the city laws and tha
creation of healthful conditions.
The Board of Supervisors should nur
chase a site for a Festhouse In the ex
treme southeasterly boundary of thÂ«
count/, and at an eorly dat* locate on
JS^t/SSw. the Clty *â¢ new C 1"
Park.
A new Interest has been awakened ta Om
June, within ten days thereafter he must
act, and consideration of his veto -of the
said budget or any part thereof. If there
be j such veto, shall be finally considered
by the board by the last Monday in June.
On the last Monday of June the tax levy
must be made for city purposes. Therefore,
when the board acts upon the tax levy
finally, it will, first, have no official knowl
edge of the amount of assessment roll, and Â¦'Â¦
secondly, it will not have met as a Board
of Equalization, because under the general
law the sessions of the Board of Equaliza
tion cannot be held earlier than the first
Monday In July. I therefore recommend
the Assessor to unofficially Inform the
board of the approximate total of the as
sessment roll as early as possible. Sit
.
the holding of elections, which they might
do by making an Insufficient appropriation.
I trust all public officers will co-operate
cheerfully in conducting their departments
economically and within the amount allot
ted them -by the Board of Supervisors.
Outside of the tax rate the revenue of the
city and county consists principally of li
cense receipts. The charter exempts from
license tax every business conducted at a
fixed place, except such as require permits
from the Board of Police Commissioners.
The exempted licenses a^gre^ated $94,C00 for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 189?. This Is
a loss In the city's revenues which should
be made up by the Board of Supervisors
after a study of local conditions by a re
vision of the license orders now In force.

either tide of the central aisle. Chairs of

have the right of attendance and discus

eighteen-page type-written message The
Supervisors settled themselves In their '
heats, listening with absorbed attention '
to the elaborate message, which reads as i
follows:
To the Honorable, the Hoard of Super
visorsâGentleman: The inauguration of
the new city government un.ler the charter

In fine the old order of thlnes is to be
superseded by a progressive policy which
will result in the creation of a new San
Francisco.
We have at last home rule. The con
stitutional amendment* recently inter
preted by the Supreme CÂ«/urt absolutely

of the right to interfere In our city affairs.

the new charter and we have now all the
responsibilities of free men and our suc
cess or failure will depend upon our own
efforts. The Mayor has become the executive
and administrator and I* responsible for
tte execution of the law* and for the wieo '
necessary for the redemption of the bonds
will be raised every year and will go into
a slnklnir fund, and the board must invite
bids for the redemption of the bonds, in no
event paying therefor more than par. If.
after proper - advertisement, bonds are not
ofTered for redemption. Interest shall cease
upon the highest numbered bonds to the
extent of the amount on hand available for
their purchase. The City and County Attor
ney has been authorized to begin condem
nation proceedings but desires complete ab
stracts for each piece of property before be
ginning any action. It will be the duty of
the board to provide such abstracts, either
by collecting them from the property-own
ers and running them down or by contract.
This work should be done Immediately In
order that these lands may be acquired and
Improved for park purposes, if possible,
within the present calendar year. The two
Mission blocks have been offered to the
city for $300,000. and it will be the duty of
the board either to negotiate for their pur
chase or order condemnation proceedings,
as no action has been taken with respect
to this particular property.
Schools and Hospitals.
The bonds authorized for schools, $1,400,

municipal Improvement act. They are
forty-year bonds, payable In gold coin, bear
interest at the rate of 3 per cent, and are
known as rerials, that Is to say, one-fortieth,
of the entire amount is raised every year for
redemption, and in selling the bonds they
are so numbered that one-fortieth is pay
able in one year, one-fortieth in two years,
one-fortieth in three years, and so on. The
bonds of later maturity will naturally sell
for a higher premium. In the present con
dition of the money market, however, it Is
nut reasonable to expect a large premium,
but it is important that the constitutional
amendment submitted by the last Legisla
ture to be voted upon next No vemtwr should
prevail exempting all State, county and
municipal bonds of California from taxa
tion. Without interfering with the progress
of these public undertakings It. may be pos
sible to defer the actual issue of the bonds
until after the November election, in which
event they will in all likelihood be exempt
from taxation, and hence our own people
can afford to buy and hold them. Â¦If they
are not exempted from taxation they will cer
tainly be sold and held outside of the State of
California. In case the amendment does not

factory in this, that the net bonded indebt
edness amounts to only $04,000, and that the
value of the property actually owned by the
city is $27,600,000. The rate of taxation for
the last fiscal year for city and county pur
purposes was I1.02S; for State purposes.
$00,601; total, $1.63, which was levied on an
assessment of $375,000,000. This produced,
revenue by direct taxation as follows: For
city and county purposes, $3,858,750; for
State purposes, $2,253,750; total $6,112,500.
The amount of money derived from other
sources than taxation, including license tax
for local purposes, amounted to $1,435, 578.
The duty of the Supervisors will be, there
fore, to provide a progressive yet economical
government, on a maximum expenditure as
follows: Tax of $1 on $405,000. 0u0. $4,050,000;
revenue from other sources, $1,345,000; tax
for parks and squares (minimum 7 cents),
$283,500; interest and sinking funds, $25,000;
total, 15,703,500. This is the maximum rev
enue possible within the pledge, and is, per
haps, more than sufficient, because, on ac
count of the Increased assessment roll, it
yields $400,000 more than the revenue raised
last year and makes the rate $l.w, as
arrainst $1,029.
It will be seen that there Is a margin here
for meeting increased interest and sinking
fund accounts, made necessary, perhaps,
by the new bonds. In the meantime the
revenue can be used for the improvement
of accepted streets and other necessary pur
poses. It will devolve upon the board to
provide for the issuance of the bonds for
park extension; the construction of the new
schoolhouses and the repair of the old; the
erection of a city and county hospital and
the beginning of a new sewer system.
Park Extension.
In my message last January I recom
mended the connection of the Presidio with
the Park and the extension of the'so-called
panhandle to the Junction of Van Ness ave
nue and Market street, and I desire to thank
the outgoing Board of Supervisors for their
friendly co-operation, and, indeed, for their
uniform courtesy throughout the year. The
bonds have now been voted for this pur
pose and for the acquisition of two blocks
in the Mission for a public square; the au
thorized amount for all park purposes be
ing $4,550,000. These bonds are issued under
the park improvement act, and, as required
by law. will run for twenty years, are pay
able in lawful money, and bear 3H per cent
interest. One twentieth of the amount
ting as a Board of Equalization in July,
the Supervisors may equalize the roll as
presented by the Assessor, if they find it
desirable, by deducting from one assess
ment and adding to another; but if they
increase the total roll, as they would have
the power to do, they simply increase the
une.pporttoned revenues of the city, which
will go into the surplus fund and Which
will possibly be only available at the end
of the fiscal year.
Illogical and Vicious.
There is one elemental thlmr in city
finances which must be respected, that in,
no department shall exceed Its appropria
tion. The Superior Court has ruled that the
Board of Health may appoint subordinates
irrespective of the appropriation, and that
they shall be paid out of the treasury. This
Is illogical and vicious, because otherwise
the legislative body, which is the power of
the puree, would be ignored.
The Board of Public Works, as well as the
Board of Health, under the charter has the
same right in almost the identical language
of the superseded statute to employ neces
sary employes and fix their compensation,
but that must certainly mean within the
appropriation allowed the several depart
ments, and I would like to so construe it.
The Election Commission is independent of
this restriction because the Supreme Court
has held that not even the legislative power
of the city has the right to interfere with

tions, by any department.

The pledge In the Democratic platform
on which the Mayor and a majority of the
members of the board were elected limits
you to the raisin* of a tax not exceeding
ore dollar on the $100, based upon the
present valuation of property assessed and
exclusive of the amounts necessary for the
Interest and sinking; fund and mainte
nance of parks and squares. This Is the
charter limit also, with the exception that
the pledge refers to the present roll In
stead of the assessment roll which may
be submit tod for the next fiscal year by
the At-sessnr. which presumably will be as
great, if not Kteater. In amount. The
present assessment roll is $405,000,000. I
Â¦would call your attention to a slight dis
connection between the duties of the
board and the duties of the Assessor
which can be easily remedied by co-op
eration. The Assessor is required to turn
over his assessment roll to the Super
visors on the first Monday in July, and
thf- Supervisors are required by the charter
to make the tax levy not later than the last

By the motion of Sanderson the selec
tion of committees was again brought be
fore the board. Sanderson wished to show
that the sanction of the board to the
election of the Finance Committee was
not unanimous, no member of the Repub
lican party having been appointed on It. ,
It was put to a vote. Duboce, Sanderson
and Boxton registering negatives, so all
the committees stood just as the Mayor
read them originally.
Adjournment began to suggest ideas to
the new Supervisors at this time. An at
tempt was made to have the regular meet
ing hour of the board fixed at 8 p. m.. but
this was lost and the board adjourned to
meet again next Monday at 2 p. m.
Before adjournment on the motion of
Dwyer, the board resolved to hold a cau
cus" to consider the question of employes.
The entire board with the Mayor filed
into the committee room and there con
sidered the subject for an hour. R. M.
Hotaling had joined his brothers by this
time so the band of fathers was com
plete The question proved too ponderous
for the first meeting, so the matter was
referred to a joint committee of the Ju
dlciarv and Finance committees, of which
Supervisor Jennings will be chairman and
James P. Booth secretary. The joint com
mittee will Investigate the proposition
and report to another caucus meeting on
of which was that it resulted in nothing
more Berlous than bruised heads and
blackened eyes and a superficial bullet
wound In the neck of John O'Brien, one
of Sheehan's hired fighters. Clubs culled
from office furniture, glass globes
snatched from office lights, ink wells and
other quickly plucked weapons swished
.through the air and chairs were hurled
from one end of the office to the other.
The police Joined in the melee and for a
few minutes there was a rataplan of lo
cust clubs on every head that made itself
prominent. At the end of it all Scott and
his deputies and Sheehan and his were
in possession, and things remained that
way until late In the afternoon when Su
perior Judge Bahrs issued an order re
straining aneehan from interfering with
Scott in the administration of his office
and the defeated candidate called oft his
dogs of war and departed.
It has been known for a week that Shee
han would contest Scott's entrance to the
office, although it was not at first thought
that he would resort to force to maintain
himself. The intimation that he would
do so did not come until Saturday night
last when Sheehan and his deputies barri
caded the doors with heavy timbers and
about all of the movable ofilce furniture.
They also screwed down the windows and
removed the knobs from all the doors,
and, a more serious matter still, had also
removed the official cash books, and theso
were still missing when Scott finally won
possession of the office and took account
of stock.
The signal for yesterday's battle was
Scott's appearance promptly at noon at
the door of the office. Sheehan and his
gang had been waiting for him since 11
o'clock. Sheehan was stationed at the
gateway leading behind his desk. Next
him was Jack Williams, a notorious ex
prize fighter, and gathered around the two
were Larry Hagan, Sheehan's chief dep
uty Tim Sullivan, a gang foreman in the
employ of the Market-street Railway
Company and the man in charge of Shee
han's hired fighting force; Jack Coleman,
another prize fighter, Mike Sullivan and a
half dozen other disreputables. Under the
desk before them each man had a club in
pickle waiting for the fight they proposed
to put up.
and then over the counter Jumped Ruef,
Scott, George Fiddes and "Big Jack
Fitzgerald. They were met half way by
Sheehan's gang, each one of which had
quickly grabbed his- club, and he began to
swing it lustily and with effect. Mike Sul
livan smashed Scott full in the face with a
glass lamp globe, and Scott replied with
a swing that brought Sullivan down from
his perch on a stool. Aleck Greggalns got
across with his gang and mixed things
with every one who came to the front.
Jack Sullivan of Sheehan's forces picked
up a chair and felled "Big Jack" Fitzger
ald, but Fitz caught his feet again and
clinched with John Doyle. As they went
to the floor the sound of a pistol shot rang
out from behind the counter on Sheehan's
side, and Jack O'Brien, a grocer and poli
tician, of Nineteenth and Shot
well streets. twirled round three
or four times and dropped to the
floor with a bullet in his neck. Abe Ruef
leaped to a table and was promptly
knocked off by a heavy glass inkwell
thrown from the end of the office by Char
ley Broad. Ruef got up and was promptiy
knocked down again with a well directed
chair, which he secured in turn and ured
in nearly boating out the brains of his as
sailant. He also used it skillfully in fell
ing one of Sheehan's gang who was at
tempting to strike Scott from behind with
the substantial leg of a heavy oaken
chair. Notwithstanding Sheehan's heavy
armament, Scott's men rapidlygot the bet
ter of the fight, and then the police broke
in with their clubs drawn, and by the
time they got through mixing things there
was not enough fight left in the cro^d
to lend interest to a Sunday picnic.
O'Brien, who had been shot, got on his
feet again and announced that he nad
rather fight than go to the hospital, but
he was finally talked out of his belliger
ency, and Dr. Helntz, the City Physician,
later cut the bullet out of the back of bis
neck where it had lodged near the spine.
Charlie Broad, who was careful not to
come within danger distance of the tlgnt
ing was promptly arrested upon a churite
of assault with a deadly weapon. He was
accused of having thrown inkwells, ani
when arrested was found with a loaded
revolver In his hand.
John Doyle, who had been one of the
weakest fighters in Sheehan's bunch, went
to the police and accused Ben Salomon
of having fired the shot that laid O Brien
out and Salomon was promptly arrested,
notwithstanding that he had taken no
part in the melee and was not witnin
thirty feet of the shooting when it oc
curred. A dozen witnesses will testify to
the fact that he had nothing whatever to
do with it and many of them stand ready
to Identify the guilty party as soon as he
shall be apprehended.
After the police had separated the com
batants, carried the wounded from the
scene of riot and gathered together the
weapons of offense and defense Mr. Ruef,
representing Mr. Scott, went before Judge
Bahrs and filed suit to restrain Sheehan
from further interfering with plaintiff's
â¢ effort' to take possession of the office and
conduct the business thereof. In his com
plaint Scott alleged that Sheehan, in con
federation with other fictitious defend
ants named, without right and contrary
to the force and effect of the laws made
and provided, surrounded himself with
an armed force and went to the office with
the object In view of Interfering with
plaintiff's attempt to take possession
SHEEHAN'S ACCOUNTS
ALLEGED TO BE SHORT
TAX COLLECTOR J. H. SCOTf and
his attorney, A. Ruef. claimed last
night that when they finally got hold
of ex-Tax Collector Sheehan's books yes
terday afternoon they discovered evi
dences of the rankest frauds. Although
Sheehan and his deputies carried away
their cash books. In order, it Is asserted,
to prevent the exposures that would re
sult if they were experted. they left their
block and assessment books, and It was In
these that Mr. Ruef claims to have found
most flagrant fraud.
The attorney is of the opinion that Shee
han did not "work his graft" by cashing
bogus warrants, but by juggling the as
sessment figures presented by the Asses
sor. He claims to have found evidence to
prove that Sheehan was in the habit of
falsifying the original assessments when
he transferred them to his own books, so
that his profits must have mounted up
IntoUiundreds of dollars. For instance, if
the Assessor gave a valuation of a piece
of property as $2000 Sheehan would enter
it in his books as $TOOO and make collec
tions accordingly. When he made his set
tlement with the Auditor he would set
t!e en the Assessor's $2000 basis and put
the difference in his own pocket.
It has been frequently remarked that
Sheehan must have some reason stronger
than the love of office for the desperate
fight he was making against giving up his
books, and Ruef and Scott are strongly
inclined to think that they have found the
reason. To-day they will demand the re
turn of the cash books of the office, and
upon their recovery startling exposures
aro expected.
HEALTH BOARD QUITS
WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE Burns Board of Health went
quietly out of office at noon yester
day and made way, with only a per
ceptible struggle, for its successor.
Its well-laid plans to maintain itself in
office notwithstanding the provisions of
the charter were knocked ir.to a cocked
hat by a sudden and serious attack of
"cold feet" suffered by Dr. Barbat. The
new board won out hands down, and Dr.
Coffey was the only member of the out
going board who had the courage of his
convictions and offered to fight.
Mayor Phelan arrived at the board
rooms shortly before noon and at once be
came the presiding officer of the meeting
then going on. Promptly at noon his ap
pointees appeared and made formal de
mand upon the old board for possession of
the office. Dr. Coffey demurred. He
claimed that the board had been appointed
by the Governor of the State and that the
charter in no wise affected its tenure of
office. He moved that the old board re-

Mayor until the board authorized the ap

lic Works was requested to file a list of
cmplo>Â«s not laborers and . state tho
amount of bonds necessary In each case.
D' Ancona thought that the civil service
laws should apply to the employes of the
Board of Supervisors, and accordingly In
troduced a resolution that all men now In
the employ of the office who have givn
long, efficient and faithful service should
be retained. This resolution *was referred
to the Judiciary Committee out of fear
Friday night how many men are needed
for cierks and what employes shall be

there will be few changes in the clerk

clerk.

SCOTT WINS OFFICE IN
A DISGRACEFUL BRAWL
JOSEril 11. SCOTT, chosen Tax Col
lector at the late election, yesterday
observed the provisions of the char
ter and took possession of his office
promptly at noon; but he had to do it
with a club. Edward I. Sheehan, the then
Incumbent, declined to acknowledge the
worth of. Scott's election certificate and
attempted to hold the office against him
with the aid of his deputies and a horde
of hired thugs - ar.d ex-prize fighters
bought for the occasion and armed with
every nondescript weapon from a loaded
double-barreled shotgun to a heavy hick

vulgar standpoint, was one of the pret
tiest specimens of "rough house" that has
been raised since the good old days in
politics when the heaviest tout carried
away the ballot-box. From the other
point of view it was the most disgraceful
and wantonly unnecessary scene that
evrr characterized the inception of a new.
order in the city and county. For the
better part of a quarter hour the Tax
Office at the City Hall was the scene of
a brawl that would have cost the reputa

to the affair, Scott and Sheehan, with
their following of deputies and drink
sodden roughs, mixed things in a hand

AN AMERICAN PACIFIC CABLE.
ONE of the most valuable contributions yet made
to the discussion of the problem of construct
ing a cable telegraph across the Pacific froni
the United States to Asia is contained in a paper read
at the recent meeting of electrical engineers in New
York by Captain George Owen Squier of the United
States army.
Captain Squier declares there Is no longer any
doubt of the practicability of the Pacific cable project
from a technical and engineering point of view. A
preliminary' survey, he says, between the coast of
California and the Hawaiian Islands was completed
by the Navy Department in 1892, showing the entire
practicability of that part of the route. The United
States ship Nero has been engaged since April last in
a survey of the bed of the Pacific along the proposed
route of the cable from the Hawaiian Islands west
ward to the Philippines and Japan. This survey has
developed two unusual features along the route by
way of Midway Island, one of them being a sub
marine mountain rising front the floor of the ocean
having a depth of 2200 fathoms to within 82 fathoms
of the surface; the other being an abyss of 4900
fathoms, one of the deepest yet discovered in the sea,
at a distance of about 500 miles east of Guam. These
and other obstacles which may be found Captain
Squier says can be avoided in laying the cable by
making detours around them.
Two routes are discussed for covering the distance
between Honolulu and Guam, one by way of Midway
Island and the other by way of Wake Island. It is
advised that one of those routes be selected as a
cable direct from Honolulu to Guam would be about
3650 miles long, including "slack" wire, and that
length would ro. reduce the through speed of the
cable and so increase the original cost that it would
be cheaper to establish and maintain the intermediate
station. . .
It is estimated that to yield a revenue which will re
pay the cost of maintenance and repairs the cable will
have to earn $925,000 a year. The cost of transmit
ting messages is calculated at about 8 cents a word,
and the present commercial rate from Washington to
Manila is $2 38 a word.' Captain Squier says: "It is
seen that at the present commercial rate to Manila,
after allowing for the present land rates to San Fran
cisco, the proposed cable is required to operate less
than fifty minutes per day in order to earn the income

FRAUDS IN FOODSTUFFS.
1 mj FFORTS made in New York to obtain the par
dop of two men sent to prison in that State
* â * for violating the oleomargarine law by remov
ing from the packages the marks by which it could be
distinguished from butter have had the effect of re
viving the "discussion there concerning the extent to
which the food laws are violated, and as a result some
very interesting figures are made public.
It appears that during the past year the State Com
missioner of Agriculture reported to the Attorney
General for prosecution no less than 731 cases of vio
lation of the agricultural law. That of course covers
only such frauds in foodstuffs as affect those which
are produced by the agriculturists of New York. It
affords, however, a basis upon which to found esti
mates of the frequency of such offenses. When so
large a number of offenders are detected in a single
year in a single State it is clear that such practices in
the country at large are of portentous frequency.
The argument of those who are seeking the par
don of the men who were passing off oleomargarine
for butter is the familiar one that the product they
offered was in every respect as good as butter; that
no harm was done to the consumers. Such an argu
ment, however, is really worse than none. It has been
put forward in defense of almost all kinds of adul
terated or sophisticated foods. The answer to it is
plain. If the concoctions of various kinds with which
the market is flooded be as good as pure foods they
should be sold under their right title and the pur
chaser given the choice to take them or reject them.
It is unfair to permit spurious food to be palmed off
under the title of pure food. The law which forbids
such practices is just, and so long as violations of it
are so frequent there should be no pardon for those
who are convicted.
The efforts of the States to put an end to the mis
representation of foodstuffs have proven unavailing.
It will require a national statute to adequately deal
with the subject, and such a law, it is to be hoped,
will be enacted by Congress this winter. A stringent
label law is what is desired, and ample provision
should be made for enforcing it. If there were nearly
a thousand offenses against the New York law in one
year it is safe to say the national law would be vio
lated so frequently for a while at least that a strong
body of officers would be needed to maintain it. A
year or so of vigilance and firmness, however, would
put an end to the greater part of such practices, and
then the makers of pure foods would no longer be
exposed to the ruinous competition of unscrupulous
dealers in fraudulent articles.

social ethics and horse-racing ought to be visitors to

Mayor Phelan has been charged with having made
ante-election promises contrary to the statutes. He
j to:i:ised â to get support â that his Commissioners
would appoint Esola Chief of Police. He violated the
purity law in that. He promised the political man
n^er-s of the Fire Department, in return for their
support, that he would not dismember that depart-
n;Â«-m. Almost at the same time he promised, also
foi support at the polls, that he would cause the ap-
;Â¦Â¦:::. -nt of Joseph C. Gorman to the place of Max
uwcll.
In addition to bein? violations of the purity of
elections law, the*e promises were preliminary to
; ledge breaking, at which the Mayor docs not seem
to scruple. With that phase of the matter, however, it
s not ibe province of the District Attorney to in
terfere. His sworn duty cails upon him to take official
notice of ofTenscs against the purity law and compels
him to proceed; against the offenders. The language
â¢;>tute is. plain, and there is no chance to mis

not provide escape for the wealthy offender and pen-
alty for the pauper. It docs not point out a loophole
for Mayor Phelan and a prison cell for Sternberg. It
demands retribution for infractions of any of its pro
visions.
Mr. Byington Knows this as well as anybody clac,
and he knows now, if he did not before, that Mayor
Phclatn stands charged as an offender against the law.
Mr. Jlyington's duty is clear. He should prosecute

BYINGTON'S PLAIN DUTY.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY BYINGTON at the

with a demand to do his duty. The charter he

it automatically folds bade against the head, and in so doirstr
moves' a safety catch into nucli a position as to prevent tho
striker in the point of the torp<"do moving. In this position it
may be struck or handled with impunity, but it Is claimed that
the moment it is towed through the water it becomes onca
more a deadly peril to any ship that may graze It.
The Lege torpedo is constructed of Delta metal, which,
while being as strong as st?el, la not liable to rust and corro
sion from immersion In water. The charge Â»3 ot cylindrical
shape and Is easily inserted and removed from the head of tho
torpedo, so that the apparatus can be stored â¢with perfect safety
ready to hand, while the charges are placed out of harm's war
in a magazine.
Other advantages claimed for it are those of automatically
adjusting Itself to the depth required, and on encountering th-5
defensive nets of an Ironclad, of assuming a vertical position,
diving beneath them and striking the hull with Its point as
soon as it is clear. The great point in favor of the new -weapon
would appear to be its simplicity, but on the other hand it does
not seem impossible for an enemy to so damage or destroy thÂ»
endless chain as to stop Us motion, when the whole set of tor
pedoes would at once become Innocuous. Nor, for that mat
ter, does it seem very improbable that Its working might ba
affected by the explosion of one of Its own torpedoes.
EXTREMELY flshlike is the new towing torpedo, the
"Lego," the weapon recently Invented by a Frenchman.
Though it can be used much in tho same way as the old
Harvey torpedo, with which some of the British ships
were equipped before the advent of the Whitehead, by
being towed at an angle under an enemy's ship, provided she
allowed the operator to approach near enough to do so, its
principal function Is the defense of ports and harbors.
It differs from the Brennan, which to all intents and pur
poses is an automobile weapon, but at the same time it is much
simpler and probably much less expensive, though special ar
rangements have to be made for its use, says the London Dally
Graphic, as will be seen by reference to the accompanying
sketch. An endless chain is stretched round four horizontal
wheels or pulleys so as to cover the portion to be guarded, and
is eet In motion by means of a second chain driven by an en
gine on shore. To the first mentioned chain a series of Lege
torpedoes are attached at intervals, and the Idea is that as the
chain moves round on its rollers the channel Is constantly
patrolled, as it were, by two lines of traveling mines moving
in opposite directions, so that it would bo practically impossi
ble for a ship to pass through this guarded zone unscathed.
Immediately the chain is stopped the torpedoes become
harmless, for on the strain belns taken off the towing lever
THE SHEEHAN OUTRAGE.
SHEEHAN'S determination to keep out of the
office of Tax Collector the man whom the peo
ple elected to fill the position has brought about
a fight which disgraces the city and came near cost
ing the life of at least one man. Sheehan's only ex
cuse for this display of violence and brutality is that
he deems the election of Mr. Scott to the office to
have been invalid. In that belief he has taken it upon
himself to usurp the authority of the courts, pro
nounce judgment in his own favor, and to resist by
force the attempt of^Mr. Scott to enter upon the
duties and take possession of the office to which he
has been elected.
Such offenses as that of which Sheehan has been
guilty have been committed in Chicago, but, we be
lieve, in no other American city. Even in Chicago
they have been rare, for it requires a very unscrupu
lous and very bold office-holder indeed to attempt to
retain the position in defiance of the law after the ex
piration of the legal term. San Francisco has had to
bear the stain and disgrace of many political scandals,
but such a thing as a fight with clubs and pistols for
the possession of office has never until this time black
ened her record.
The story of the fight will of course be reported far
and wide, and the good repute of the city will be in
jured. The new era in municipal government, which
in other respects has opened auspiciously enough, has
in this regard been marred by an outrage worse than
any known to the past. It is due to fortune only that
we have not to record the affray as one resulting in
death as well as in bloodshed, for it was evidently the
intention of Sheehan to hold to his office at all haz
ards, whatever might be the consequences to others
and to the community.
In Spanish-American politics an election is always
followed by a fight. When the people have cast their
ballots in favor of a new set of officials the members
of the old regime barricade themselves and refuse to
surrender the offices. That is the style of politics
Sheehan would like to introduce here. He has made
the attempt, and the result has been the most dis
graceful political outrage in our annals.
The offense of Sheehan is the more gross because
the question of Scott's eligibility to the office is now
before the courts for adjudication. Sheehan's deter
mination to pass judgment on the issue himself- is
therefore something in the nature of contempt of
court as well as a violation of law and of public de
cency. It was his duty to leave the decision of the
matter to the court, where his rights would have
ample protection, and in undertaking to assert his
claim by force he has disgraced himself and the city
without in the least strengthening his position in law.
It is to be hoped there will be found adequate means
cf punishing offenses of this kind. We cannot tolerate
here the Spanish-American practice of accompanying
each election with a free fight. Our laws are sufficient
for the protection of the right of every citizen and of
every office-holder, and nothing can justify such ac
tions as that of which Sheehan has been guilty.

the past. They merely see at a distance things which
are underfoot, but unseen. More than this, they af
fect to see at a distance things which are not there,
but are near by, though unseen by them. This is a
mirage effect on minds debauched by misuse, prosti
tuted by the habit of putting what they wish to be
for what is. The actual reality near at hand, though
invisible, appears in the distance like those phantom
scenes on the desert, in which clods become houses
and spears of dry weed wave the inviting foliage of a
forest. The most defiant imperialist in California is
General Otis, who sometimes crosses the Rubicon
and sometimes edits the Los Angeles Times. He is
fiercely pro-British in the South African contest and
raves at ail Americans who will not worship with him
st the feet of British power.
He recently denounced the name and title, "United
States of South Africa," particularly because it was of
American origin and "the invention of charlatans and
sensationalists, designed to work upon the prejudices
oi those who do not take the trouble to look beneath
the surface of great questions." The general then
proceeds to look beneath the surface of great ques
tions to this effect: "Even if Kruger and his coterie
of absolutists were willing to have the provinces of
South Africa united under a republican form of gov
ernment, similar to that of the United States, it would
be necessary before such a thing could be done to se
cure the co-operation of the people of South Africa,
since a republican government must of necessity, if it
is to be stable, rest upon the consent of the governed.
To obtain such consent would be impossible, for the
reason that interests, opinions and affiliations are so
diverse. Homogeneity of race, of aims, of purposes
and of opinions, is wanting, and without it concert
and harmony of action would be impossible. The
United States of South Africa would be a house di-
vided against itself and foredoomed to go down in
the red ruin of revolution and anarchy, if left to its
Therefore, he argues, Great Britain must be per
mitted to take and govern those people as she sees
fit. But Great Britain is not a republic. In England,
Scotland and Wales that Government is a constitu
tional monarchy. In Ireland, India and Guiana it is
an absolute despotism. Such it will be in South
Africa if its arms prevail, for such conquests must be
held only by unrelenting force and vigilance, pre
pared always to kill in restraint of the repressed as
piration of men to be free.
The United States of America is a republic, a Gov
ernment all of whose powers are delegated to it by the
constitution. General Otis declares homogeneity of
race, aspirations, opinions and purpose and consent of
the governed to be necessary to the stability of a
republic. He sees this clearly and correctly while
looking to far Africa. Why does he not see it while
looking at home? He is fiercely intolerant of oppo
sition to American imperialism. That policy means
bringing under our flag and jurisdiction probably
twenty millions of people, alien to us in race, opinions
and purposes. They are A be brought in mainly

The arguments upon the advantages to be derived
from the cable need not be repeated, as they are fa
miliar to all. Our rapidly expanding commerce with
the Orient renders it highly desirable that our mer
chants should have direct and speedy communication
with all oriental ports. The proposed American
cable would of course be connected with the Japanese
and Chinese cables and land telegraphs and would put
us in direct relations with those lines, so that from
San Francisco it would be easy to communicate at
once with any part of the Pacific coast of Asia.
The project of constructing such a cable has long
been under consideration in Congress and will be
brought forward at the present session. Whether the
enterprise will be favored will depend of course upon
the nature of the measures proposed to carry it out.
If they be wisely devised the great project may soon
be under way with the general approval of the public.

ensign of freedom. They are to be denied voice in
the Government by which we will rule and repress
them. What sort of republican government will such
government be?
If General Otis attempt to run away from the ob
vious answer that it will be despotic government â
that the United States will be a constitutional repub
lic at home and an absolute monarchy in the new
possessions*, called by the ever accursed name, "colo
nies" â he must then admit that these twenty millions
of tropical aliens are to be incorporated into our body
politic, to have our franchise, and lacking that
homogeneity, the absence of which he so deplores
in South Africa, their presence will foredoom the re
public to go down in the red ruin of anarchy and
revolution. It is remarkable that such men as Otis
are republicans only for the purposes of tyranny and
despotism. They hold the true Tory idea that the
many must be ruled by the few lest the many make
mistakes in ruling themselves. It is the same argu
ment that was made against our forefathers. General
Otis takes the same position against the Dutch and
against all peoples who long for the light of liberty
and are struggling toward it with arms in their hands
and are dying with its sheen in their dazed eyes.

A PLEA FOR ENGLAND
IN THE TRANSVAAL
The Call floes not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Editor The Call: I hope you will give a
little space In your columns to- a word for
the English rights in the present struggle
with the Boers. The columns of all the
large dailies are open to the sentimental
trash brÂ«_-d by prejudice, envy, traditional
hatred and ignorance, and it is only oc
casionally that any paper seems willing
to publish even a small part of the truth
regarding the causes which brought about
the present war.
In the first place, the Boers are the only
Christian nation on the face of the earth
to-day that are slave owners and that
adopt the most merciless practices In se
curing their slaves. History tells us that
their first quarrel with England was In
their deliance of her ant: =.c.ye laws. They
left Capo Colony betau? j .hey would not
give up their slaves and went north, but
have never been outside of territory over
which England claimed to have suze-
Neither did the Mormons, when they left
Illinois because they were not allowed to
have their peculiar institutions in that
State, leave United States territory, al
though they went to Utah, where the root
of a white man had never been before and
hewed out of the wilderness a paradise.
We claimed them as subjects and de
stroyed their religion in so far as it did
not agree with the laws established for
the whole people; and It was right. How
much more would it be right if they had
appealed to us to save them from annihi
lation by the red men, as England has had
to save the Boers from the blacks?
How much more would it have been
right if Brigham Young had sent com
missioners to the Eastern States asking
for men and money to help them develop
the resources of Utah and when they ar
rived had violated every promise made?
But leave the question of England's suze
rainty out of the discussion entirely. Eng
lish subjects were in the Transvaal doing
business under promises made by l^esi
dent Kruger, and those promises were ig
nored to that extent that their property
was fast becoming coniiscated without
any future hope of redress. It had
simply become impossible to secure citi
zenship there. I ask you what could they
do? There wa3 only two ways out of the
dilticulty â local revolution or an appeal to
the mother country. Jameson's raid dem
onstrated that local revolution was a fail
ure, and the home Government was ap
pealed to. ,
What would have English colonies have
done if England had said we will not help
you? What- would the foreign nations
have said If England had Ignored the
prayer of her people? And England said
it must be remedied.
Diplomacy was adopted until even Eng
land was taunted with being afraid, and
the result was that President Kruger felt
that he was master of the situation. He
refused to do what he had promised to
do and he was cunning enough to take
advantage of the situation. He heard the
clamor of the nations who were envious
of England and saw that she would be
blamed for trying to oppress his people
for commercial reasons, and he knew that
if in a war he was successful his people
would be the gainers of billions of wealth
from English owners, and If he lost he
would be in the game position as any
English colony. There is no wonder that
he declared war. If England had made
any concession In the face of that declara
tion she would have deserved the con
tempt of the world, but she has not and
dare not. If England was the tyrant
some of our Imported citizens wish to
make her, what position would her colo
nies take to-day? Certainly not the one
they are taking in furnishing her with
men and money, and their action is the
best refutation of the mean, cowardly at
tacks made on her. In the foregoing I
have not gone into details, which would
greatly emphasize her right, but have
only stated what is known to the world,
without bias or prejudice. I am an Amer
ican-born citizen, and since I can remem
ber anything I have always honored Eng
land for her care for her subjects, and
that Is her only crime In this war.

been arranged for the evening's entertain
ment. "Doc" Flynn and Charles Itochette
will furnish the event of the evening.
They will tight at 130 pounds and are
scheduled to go ten rounds. The battle
between these two will be worth seeing.
Flynn Is looked upon as a gritty and
clever boxer and Rochette has already
won a name for his ability to take and
administer punishment. Flynn has im
proved greatly since his voluntary "go"
with L,awler. The young boxer helped
train "Jack" O'Brien for his fight with
Neill and learned many new points about
the game. He is strong and can deliver
damaging blows. Both boys have trained
faithfully for their match.
The other bouts will be between Wil

pounds; Charles Johnson and Jack Sulli
van at -the same weight; William Lundy
and Charles Trost at US pounds, and Kid
Dobson and Ed Wiley at 115 pounds.

NEILL AND
O'BRIEN TO
BE MATCHED
BOTH LADS
CONFIDENT
OF VICTORY
National Athletic Club Man
agers Offer Th?m a Re
turn Fight
The National Athletic Club has virtu
ally dÂ«K-ide<i to give "Jack" O'Rrien and
Al ScUl a return engagement. Both men
have expressed a willingness to settle the
question of supremacy, and it is proba
ble that on Friday. February 9, the two
will .".cain come together in Woodward's
Pavilion. Both men are confident of vic
tory and will each place a side bet of
j: in the hands of responsible parties.
Kver since the unsatisfactory ending of
their contest last Friday night followers
. t the ring have be<Â»i divided in their
opinions us to which was the better man,
arid this fact alcne bespeaks a large at
tendance when they again step under the
ropes.
O'Hrien is nursing a sore hand, which
he pays will be in good condition wh^n
he agaJn meets the young Ca.liforni.in. He
dislocated one of the knuckles in the
. iÂ»;hth round by striking it against his
opponent's elbow while trying to deliver
one of his effective uppercuts. O'Brien
Slated yesterday that he would prove to
the people of this city that lie could de
liver an effective punch. He has all the
confidence in the world that he can take
NeiU's measure. He does not attempt to
lMliitle Al's ability as a boxer; he thinks
him <mo of tho best in his class.
For preliminaries, Manager Gibbs will
undoubtedly match "Jack" Kaiie of this
city and Hufe Turmr of Stockton and
Phil Green and "Jack" McDonald to box
ten rounds respectively. Both fights
would excite great interest in pugilistic
circles, as tho men named have won high
honors in tlu:r chosen occupation.
Kane lately returned from Colorado,
where he defeated some of the best men
of that Stato. He is a two-handed tighter
and can hit as hard as a middle-weight.
Turner ha* Buffered but one defeat' since
he entered the ring, and that was at the
hands < 1 â¢'Kid" Parker. The men em
ployed at the Union Iron Works are so
confident that McDonald can defeat
Ore^n that they have raised Jj"jO to back
their man. McDonald Is the champion
middle- weight of the coast, having de
feated all comers for the Oelrichs belt in
the Olympic Club tournament held a few

McGovem a 2 to J Favorite
Over Dixon for To-Night's
Fight
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. B.â ln the arena of
the Broadway Athletic Club to-morrow
night George Dixon of Boston and "Terry"
McGovern of Brooklyn will struggle for
the featherweight championship of the
world and a purse of $10,000.
So far as condition and confidence are
concerned, honors are about even. No
two lighters ever trained more faithfully
than the chocolate-colored Bostonian and
the tturdy little Brooklynite. Each man
haÂ» made all kinds of sacrifices In order
to Jit himself thoroughly for the battle,
which means so much to tho winner In the
liuanciui and pugilistic world. Both are
extremely conndent oi success and each
predicts a haid light. McGovern lias the.
call in the betting at odds or 2 to 1. Very
lew large wagers have been placed on the
contest as aumirers of the colored cham
pion have aL-ked for 2Va to 1 tor tneir
money. The AlcGovern men have refused
to lay such long odds, which accounts lor
the absence of a big betting interest in the
nght.
â¢j.'he only wager of consequence recorded
to-day was between "Joe ' i>lacias and
John Blackburn. *>JU to IZSO, MaciaÃ tak
ing the short end. It is quite probable
that the betliim at the ringside will be
lively, if the Xjixou men will consent to
lake j.O to \i or 10 to 7 ior their money.
McGorern'a admirers n'gure the Brook
lynue champion over Dixon owing to his
wonderfully aggressive tactics, tremen
tious lutting power and great strength.
i'hey say tnai Dixon has never yet met
a iad who was so thoroughly equipped in
the departments nameu as the conqueror
of "Pedlar" I'almer. They also argue that
Dixon's style of lighting will suit tho
bantara-wtight champion to a nicety.
They point out that no man who has ever
torcea the lighting with McGovern has
been able to last very long before his
blows. Dixon lignts fast all the while. He
tjoes right at his man as soon as the bell
rings and this sort ot work, "Terry's"
mends say, will quickly result in Dixon's
downfall.
Those who favor Dixcn contend that the
colored boy. who is a veteran at the box
ing game, is a better ring general, just as
hara a hitter and much more clever than
McGovern. They also say that he is taller
and longer in tne reach than McGovern.
To their way of thinking the only advan
tage McGovern has is youth, and they
cannot possibly see how this single ad
vantago will give him the victory over
Dixon, who has fought English and Aus
tralian, as well as American champions,
his friends say, has never been knocked
out in actual competition. He has met
ligluers ut weights varying from 116 to 1-4
[H>unds, and, although he has been out
pointed, he has never been seriously hurt.
iiow McGovern's friends can expect a lad
with such limited ring experience as
â¢â¢Terry" possesses to knock out a man
who has engaged in more than 200 con
tests with no serious results is beyond the
comprehension of the colored boys
backers.
Dixon discussed the fight with some of
his fricnus at his training quarters in
Ltfikewood, N. J., to-day. During the dis
cussion Dixon made a remarkably strong
point as to his ability to successfully copu
with a boxer of the McGovern type. He
referred to his light with Oscar Gardner
more than a year ago. At that time
Gardner was at the top rank of feather
weights. His styie of lighting very much
resembles McGovern's. Gardner forced
the issue from the start and tried hard to
score an early knockout, but Dixon soon
put him on the defensive with swinging
left-hand body blows and eventually won.
Dixon naturally ligures that if he could
stand off Gardner, he should be equally
successful with McGovern.
DIBBLEE TO COACH HARVARD.
California Football Expert Reap-
pointed to the Position.
Special I>i?patch to The Call.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. B.â At a
meeting of Harvard football men, includ
ing members of the Varsity eleven and
class teams, held this evening in the tro
phy rooms of Harvard gymnasium, it was
announced by Captain Charles Daly that
Benjamin H. Dibblee of California had
tx-en reappointed head coach for next
year. Dibblee at present is in California.
The real object of the meeting was to get
the measurements of the different foot
ball candidates for next year. Dibblee
has made a very good record as coach
the past year, and while it was rumored
he would not accept the position of head
coach again, he was prevailed upon to
take the place. â¢f^feS

OLYMPICS TO
ENTERTAIN
FAIR ONES
An Excellent Programme Is
Arranged in Their
Honor.
Ladies will be royally entertained at the
Olympic Club to-morrow evening. Leader
John A. Hammersmith has arranged an
excellent entertainment in their honor,
and those who participate will do their
best to win the plaudits of the fair sex.
Mr. Hammersmith has during his term
as leader endeavored to make each suc
ceeding ladies' night surpass the preced
ing one. Judging by the programme lie
has increased his good endeavors.
He has a surprise in store tor those who
attend. It is in the nature of a club
swinging and boxing exhibition by twelve
gaudily dressed Chinese "kids." Profes
sor George S. Miehllng, who is known at
the club as "Mcc L.ung," has drilled his
heathen pupils into the mysteries of club
swinging, ami their progress is surpris
iiiK I"he little yellow denizens of China
town take to their exercise with delight,
and their gyrations will certainly please
the audience. Four of the club swingers
have readily adopted the American siyle
of fighting and are proficient in the use
of their hands. They are scheduled to
give a scientific exhibition with the gloves,
and li will undoubtedly be amusing.
Those who have seen tho youngsters per
form in private claim that it is more ex
citing than a regular prize-ring contest.
Queues are often unloosened in the heat
of the fray, and the referee is compelled
to keep a watchful eye on the boxers to
see that they do not foul by pulling the
tempting topknot.
The programme will open with an over
ture by the orchestra. At its conclusion
the Ah Lungs will run a potato race.
Then F. Burgess and A. L. Stone will give
their sensational exhibition in novelty
lumping into and out of barrels. George
Hammersmith will sing sweetly and in
troduce some specialties that will surely
win favor. The Lamonts will give an
acrobatic performance, and Leonardo will
follow in a thrilling flying trapeze act.
Harry Wood Brown will render a bary
tone solo, accompanied by Maurice Kram
mer. Charles Slamberg will swing clubs
and AY. J. Leonard and E. A. Carroll will
give a sparring exhibition with blackened
irlove* The "yellow kids" will follow
with three lively rounds, and the enter
tainment will conclude with springboard
leaping by Professor Leando and mem
bers of the Olympic Club.
BACKERS OF
AN OUTSIDER
FELT GLOOMY
Duke of York Won at Odds
of 150 to I and Was
Disqualified,
Probably for grand stand effect and to
satisfy the clamoring of a half-hundred
bettors, Duke of York, a 150 to 1 outsider,
was disqualified after winning the laat
race at Tanforan yesterday, and the purse
was given to Nance O'Neil. Sugden, a
strongly touted one, led the big field into
the stretch, *ith Hennessy on Duke of
York a dangerously close second. Observ
ing his mount to be tiring, Conley on the
former began currying Hennessy out,
while Hennessy in turn bore in on the col
ored rider. Over a sixteenth from the
wire Sugden was hopelessly beaten, and,
finishing strong, the Duke downed Nance
O'Neil a head. The last named mare was
extensively backed in the ring and was
given the race, although why and on what
grounds she was entitled to it is a mys
tery. Only two favorites were successful,
and the eighteen books cutting in enjoyed
another profitable day.
Tommy Grlflin was represented in tne
opening five-furlong scramble, with the
weights raised twenty-eight pounds above
the scale, by Theory. The mare ruled fa
vorite in the betting and won all the way.
Sweet William was a handy second over
Faversham.
Glengaber, a 12 to 1 shot, ridden by
Spencer, captured the mile selling run. He
was headed for over a half-mile by Storm
King, but when the latter horse tired in
the stretch again took the lead, winn'.ng
cleverly. Stuttgart, the favorite, ran
third.
Corrigan's Wallensteln scored a handy
win in the second mile selling run. going
to the post a 7 to 10 favorite. Sunello. v
20 to 1 shot, went out with a great show
ing of speed, closing up, however, when
half the route had been traversed. At the
close Ailenna gave the favorite quite a
stiff argument, losing out by only a length.
Jenkins put up a strikingly bad ride on
Mont Eagle, which finished third.
It would seem that Zoroaster has again
struck his winning lick. After twice get
ting beaten when starting favorite, the
ring laid 6 to 1 about the gelding yester
day, and he made a show of his field in
the mile and a sixteenth handicap. In
both of his former runs, it is said, he was
short, and the smart money did not go
on him. Yesterday after Marcato had led
into the stretch Spencer moved along with
Zoroaster, winning in a jog from the fa
vorite, Daisy F.
The backers of Afamada, second choice
for the six-furlong sprint, no doubt played
in great luck. Moccrito. the favorite, was
almost left and then ran a phenomenal |
race. Leading after a quarter had been
covered, Afamada downed Cyril a length,
with Glissando a close third.

SUIT DECIDED AGAINST
THE NORTHERN PACIFIC
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.â ln an opinion
handed down in the United States Su
preme Court to-day by Justice Harlan,
the title of the Oregon and California
Railway Company to large tracts ot land
in the State of Oregon was confirmed. The
lands were granted to the railroad com
pany many yeart; ago. but its claims were
contested by the Government. The main
controversy was between the Oregon and
California road and the Northern Pacific.
The Northern Pacific Company claimed
under an earlier errant, but it was shown
that this road had not filed a map of defi
nite location and thus failed to earn the
grant. Hence the court held that, not
withstanding the later date of the grant
to the Oregon Company, it was entitled
to the lands.
The lands involved lie south of Port
land and largely In the Willamette Val
ley. They embrace about 42.001 aores and
are said to be worth now $5,(Xa>,000 or J6.00J,
000.
L.ike decisions were made in the cases
of Wllcox vs. the Eastern Oregon Land
Company Â¦ and Messenger vs. the samo
company. These controversies also were
largely "with the Northern Pacific Com
pany. In conflict with military wapon
roads. The decisions were adverse to the
\nrthprn Pacific in these cases.
Kennebec's Cargo Accepted.
VAL.LEJO. Jan. S.â The Government
has accepted the cargo of coal brought
to Mare Island on the ship Kennebec at
a discount of 15 per cent. Tho Kennc
bec's cargo took fire at sea, but the cap
tain battened down her hatches and came
on to the navy-yard without reporting it.
When the vessel tied up at Mare Island
the fire was discovered and the cargo
flooded. The ship was hauled into the
Ftream and her cargo rejected. The out
come was the acceptance of the coal by
the Government at a reduced rate.

DEADLY GUNS USED
BY CHINESE AT TONKIN
TACOMA, Wash.. Jan. B.â The details of
the fighting: on the Tonkin frontier in
China in which the Chinese crossed the
Tonkin border and by a flank movement
drove the French from their position
show that the Chinese used breech-load
ing Jingals with much success.
The Jingal was adopted last year for the
Chinese army and is being turned out by
thousands at live Chinese arsenals. They
use center lire cartridges carrying two
half-ounce slugs and they carry further
than the French magazine rifles. It takes
two Chinese soldiers to operate each gun.
Later at Paksi Chinese invaded a. gam
ing house, killing three French soldiers
and wounding others.

he was discovered he was told that such
action was against the rules and that
he was disqualified. The candidates signed
assumed names to their papers and placed
their true names in an accompanying en
velope.
At the expiration of an hour all the pa
pers were locked up nr.d last night the
Commissioners commenced the task of try
ing to discover who among all the appli
cants is best fitted for a life job at $200
per month.
After the examination the commission
adjourned to the City Hall and opened the
register for applicants who seek employ
ment at unskilled labor. About six hun
dred were registered and given blanks
which they must fill In and file with the
secretary. Gustave Schnee. C. C. Kulp
and C. R. Heverin were appointed tem
porary registration clerks.
President Freud had a busy afternoon at
the City Hall. The line of men anxious to
register required several police officers to
preserve its harmony and- Mr. Freud con
tinually passed up and down the corridor
telling the applicants what they must do
and how they must do it in the future if
they would join Mayor Phelan's brigade
and receive $2 per day for eight hours'
work.
The civil service commission Is now
ready for business In its quarters room
5, in the basement of the City Hail, and
to-day all necessary blanks Will be ready
for applicants for employment in all de
partments of the city government. Ex
aminations for skilled positions will not
be held for a few days, although registra
tion will begin to-day.
Commissioner Qulnn says that the

?
LAST OFFICIAL ACT OF
THE OLD SCHOOL BOARD
THE last official act of the old Boari
of Education was performed yester
day morning, when the demands of
C. F. Weber & Co., aggregating
$7000, for furniture and supplies were pre
sented to Auditor 'Wells for his signature.
These are the supplies that were ordered
several months ago In direct violation of
the rules of the board and refused passage
by the Finance Committee on that ground.
There was also more or less scandal at
tached to the contract, which was fully
exploited in the papers at that time. Now
the committee, for some unaccountable
reason, has changed Its position In the
matter, and the demands came to the
Auditor yesterday with the signatures of
Chairman Holbrook and Director Stow.
At a recent special meeting of the board
these claims had been Incorporated In a
recommendation for payment by the com
mittee, together with laborers' and mis
cellaneous demands for $60<X> incurred last
June. Director Head, however, before the
meeting objected to the Weber demands,
claiming that he was opposed to helping
certain members to get a "rake off," and
the Weber claims were withdrawn, the
$COOO of laborers' demands only being rec
ommended. Now comes the change of
front on the part of the Finance Commit
tee, and the Weber demands have been
substituted for the others.
Auditor Wells, who now has the situa
tion in hand, asserts positively that he will
not sign the demands. He was favorably
Inclined to the laborers' claims, even
though they were Incurred in the last fis
cal year, but he expressed a hope that
there might be a way found to pay them
out- of this year's funds. In which there
Is a prospective surplus of several thou
sand dollars.
"It is my opinion." said the Auditor,
"that the Weber supplies were furnished
In June of last year, though the demands
bear dates in the months of August and
September. In this event I will not sign
them. However, I Intend to communicate
with the principals of the various schools
regarding the exact time when the desks
and other supplies were furnished. I rec
ollect that I audited enormous bills for
setting up these desks, and I am quite
sure that the work was done in June, dur
ing vacation.
"I would rather pass the laborers* de-
mands for that month, if it Is possible to
pay them out of this year's appropria
tion, but I am powerless in the matter as
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Education has seen fit to present thÂ»
ueber demands to the exclusion of the
others, which I consider worthy of more
consideration."
GODCHAUX SUCCEEDS
BERTHIER AS RECORDER
CHIEF Deputy Recorder Harry
Â£aehr and several clerks worked
hard all day Sunday to get every
thing in proper shape for the recep
tion of thÂ© incoming Recorder, Edmond
Godchaux, and when the latter made his
appearance at noon yesterday he was
cordially met by his predecessor, AI Ber
thler. who in a complimentary little
speech surrendered the office to hi 3 suc
cessor. Godchaux's attention was called
to the new system of electric lights In
the Recorder's office, and he appeared to
be pleased at the Innovation, for which
he had himself applied.

COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE
IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY
ALTHOUGH County Clerk Dean* was
111 and confined to his home. thÂ«
ushering out of the old and the In
auguration of the new administra
tion was conducted without a hitch by bis
chief deputy, Joseph Goddard. Early in
the day the work Involved In the change
of administration began to make Itself
apparent In the County Clerk's office.
First, the deputies who will hold unÂ£er
Mr. Deane were sworn in, and those w'io
went out took with them the well wishes
of the County Clerk and those -who tonic
their places. Officials of and deputies
serving in the Tax Collector's. Sheriff <Â»
Board of Health. Civil Service and Elec
tion Commissions were given the oath by
Mr. Goddard and then retired ready to
assume office.
Although the work was heavy and tho
Continued to Thirteenth Pace
main in office until puch time as an opin
ion could be had from the Attorney G< :i
eral. and was proceeding to talk to this
motion when Mayor Phelan moved as an
amendment that the board fro out of of
fice thm and there, and without further
parley. Although there was no immediate
necond to thÂ«? Mayor's motion, he finally
bluffed Dr. Barbat into its support, and
to convince the rest of the board of the
K.renjrth of his position he had presented
; ri opinion written by City and County
Attorney l^ane. which, in effect, said that
the old board had "not a leg to stand on."
A communication from the Attorney Gen
eral was read, which stated that that of
ficial could not render an opinion on the
matter so long as the board had its duly
authorized lÂ«-gal advisers, and then L>r.
liarljat asked the Mayor what the result
would be in case the board declined to
vacate. Phelan replied significantly that
he would not presume to say. except that
force would be used, whereupon Dr. Bar
bat suffered a chill and came over to the
Mayor's way cf thinking. Dr. Payne fol
lowed him. and Dr. Keency being absent,
the Mayor's amendment prevailed and the
Dnr board took formal possession.
The new board is composed of Dr. J. M.
Williamson, who was elected president;
Dr. Louis Bazet. R. W. Baum. \V. E. HoÂ»
kir.e and William D. McCarthy. -Its first
and only business of the meeting was the
appointment of the following officers:
Secretary. John A. Brown. $175 a month;
assistant secretary, J. O. Cameron, $100:
Dr. A. P. O'Brien. Health Officer, $2.0:
clerk to Health Officer. AY. J. Kelly. J100;
clerk, Frank Stanton. $10); stenographer,
Mrs. W. Turney, $70: statistician. W. D.
Griffin; messenger, I>ouls Monice; vac
â¢ inators. Drs. G. E. McPherson and Will-
Ism G. Hay.
Adjournment was taken at 1 o'clock to
Â£ o'clock last evening, when the balance of
the board's appointments were to have
been made, but at that hour it was dis
covered that the old board had spent over
?4t.<Â«00 of the $45,000 appropriation for
health purposes, leaving only a little over
$3000 to carry the new administration
through the next six months, and ad
journment was again ordered to 12 o'clock,
r.oon, to-day. In drawing for the long and
r hort terms the following results were ob
tained: Dr. Louis Bazet. one year: Dr.
W. D. McCarthy, two years; Dr. J. M.
Williamson, three years; Drs. Baum and
Hopkins, four years. It is likely that the
shortage in funds will result in a delay of
several da 3 in the official announcement
of appointments, but ways and means will
be discussed at to-day's meeting, and in
e!1 probability rome way will be found out
of the present difficulty.
MAXWELL READS THE LAW

fj-y HE principal incident at the first

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
INSTALLED IN OFFICE
THE Board of Public Works met In the
office of the City Surveyor, Commis
sioners G. H. Mendell, Jeremiah Ma
hony and Marsden Manson being
present. Colonel Mendell was elected
president of the board, which then ap
pointed J. Leo Park temporary secretary
and C. E. Grunsky City Engineer, the
latter at a salary of SS'JOO a year. The
board decided to constitute the City Sur
veyor's office as the official meeting placa
and will' meet daily at 10 a. m. The list
of employes of the Superintendent of
Streets was canvassed, but no removals
or appointments were made.
The board visited the office of the Super
intendent of Streets and took formal pos
session. A letter was addressed to the in
cumbent, Martin Fragley, requesting him
to turn over all the books and accounts
to Andrew J. Donovan, who will assume
charge. Although the latter was not ap
pointed Superintendent, it Is understood
that he will be selected at this morning's
meeting of the board.
CIVIL SERVICE PLAN
IS FAIRLY LAUNCHED
CIVIL service principles as denned In
the new charter were fairly launch
ed yesterday. The commission hav
ing no predecessor experienced no
difficulty In seating itself, and the three
members earned their first day's pay un
der the most pleasant auspices.
Precisely at the appointed hourâ 9 a. m.
â President Freud and his colleagues â P.
Hi McCarthy and John A. Qulnnâlnaug
urated the first attempt at reform along
civil service lines in tho city's history.
The commission met in the Mills build-
Ing, and on assuming his seat as presi
dent, J. Richard Freud explained briefly
the business .before the meeting and the
purpose of that section of the charter cre
ating the commission.
Notice having been given that the com
mission would hold an examination to de
termine the appointment of a chief ex
aminer, who will be also secretary of the
commission, over thirty applicants ap
peared to have their abilities tested. The
position will be held for life if a compe
tent man, or until "good reason" exists
for his dismissal, and the salary Is $2400
a year. It was expected that tnere would
be at least 100 candidates. The fact that
there is a well-grounded belief that Mayor
Phelan has a candidate for the soft
cushioned secretary's seat no doubt ma
terially curtailed tlie list of the ambitious.
The printed blanks contained tho fol
lowing five questions:
Define a municipal charter.
What are the underlying principles and
main advantages of civil service?
What departments of our city government
Will be under the merit system?
Explain the operation of the civil Bervlco
article In the new charter.
What are the principle duties of the chief
examiner and secretary?
"This is the first time that any appli
cant tor a position in the city .govern
ment has been required to show that he
Is competent," said President Freud.
"The charter makers did not Intend that
this position should bo subject to a
very severe examination, but wo con
sidered it wise to put the civil service
system in operation at the very start.
All will be allowed one hour in which to
answer tho questions."
Those who took the examination were:
Ed F. Moran, Arthur de Ettel, Robert
Halght, Arthur J. Fiek, A. D. d'Ancona,
Otto RyÃt, L. J. Welsh, Herman Lowen
stein, W. Jones Cuthbertson, Alfred
Clarke. Charles H. Forbes. C. B. Ses
sions. Gustave Schnee, O. M. Boyle, Al
exander Matheson, M. S. Woodhnms, J.
C. Hallock, A. L. Rosenberg, F. I. Nas
sault. A. S. Harrison. P. A. Meyer,
George S. McComb, Joseph Strand, Frank
D. MacÃeth, J. A. Emery, William Henry
Kejit. E. E. Newton. Joseph Head, J. J.
Mulcahy, W. W. Magary and William
Gilbert.
One elderly candidate Innocently took a
copy of the new charter from his pocket
elected temporary secretary. On motion
of Biggy the appointment af Beatty as
secretary of the board was at once re
ported to the Civil Service Commission.
Immediately after the secretary had
been chosen a drawing was held to deter
mine the terms of the new Commissioners.
Newhall drew first prize, his term of of
fice being fixed at four years. The terms
of the other Commissioners will be as fol
lows: Blggy, three years; Thomas, two
years, and McNutt one year. A copy of
the drawing was ordered sent to the
Board of Supervisors.
Blggy then moved that Newhall be
made permanent president for a term of
one year. His motion was carried, New
hall modestly declining to vote. In a brief
Fpwch Newhall thanked his fellow Com
missioners for the honor conferred on him
and promised to give his rulings with the
Valrness and impartiality' of Solomon of
Biblical fame.
The following resolutions were Intro
duced by Biggy:
Resolved, That all persons who ore candi
dates for the office of Chief of Police be
and thf-y are hereby requested to file
with thp secretary of this board prior to
noon Thursday. January 11. 1900, written
applications fur such appointment.
Itesolved, That all persons objecting to
any candidate for the office of Chief of
Police be and they are hereby requested to
file with the secretary of this board prior to
6 p. m. or Saturday, January 13. written
objections to surh candidate, setting- forth
fully their grounds of such objection.
Both resolutions were adopted without a
dissenting vote.
On motion of Dr. McNutt, the Commis
sioners agreed to meet every Tuesday
evening at 8 o'clock.
Blggy was unanimously chosen to take
charge of the affairs of the Police Depart
ment until a successor to ex-Chief Lees
is appointed. On motion of Thpmas, Lees,
who was present, was then requested to
turn the property and documents of the
department over to the acting Chief.
"That Is the very reason why I am
here, ' remarked Lees, his voice quivering
with emotion.
"It has been published that I secretly
carted away the rogues' gallery and oth
erwise left the department in a crippled
condition. I want to say right here that it
is a falsehood. It is. however, true that
I have in my possession some daguerro
types which were used by this depart
ment. They are my own personal prop
erty and rightfully belong to me. - I have
here a catalogue containing a list of the
books which contain photographs of crim
inals, and which are known as the rogues'
gallery."
Lees then passed the catalogue to the
secretary, after telling him to read it. Be
fore he was half finished with the list
Commissioner Thomas suggested that the
reading be discontinued and that the
board take the ex-Chief's word that the
gallery was Intact. This did not suit I^eea,
and he asked as a special favor that the
entire list be read. When tho secretary
finished Lees formally turned over the gal
lery and other property of the Police De
partment to acting Chief Biggy.
Lees then proceeded to throw bouquets
at the Police Department.
"Wo have, in my humble estimation, one
of the best police departments In the
country. I have always taken personal
pride and Interest In the work of the
men. and I enn say without fear of con
tradiction that the police force of San
Francisco ranks with tho best in the
world. Our system of keeping records ex
cels that of any other city In the United
States. i-( T ,
"When a patrolman nearly half a cen
tury ago I realized the Importance of
keeping a complete record as well as the
photograph of every criminal who was a
menace to society. That I have succeeded
Is shown by the work of the department.
Although I sever my connection with the
police force to-day, I shall ever be ready
to lend my assistance whenever you gen
tlemen desire It."
The ex-Chief paid a high tribute to Cap
tain Moran. the retired property clerk of
the department, who, he said, was ono of
the most honest and conscientious men
ever connected with the police force.
At the conclusion of the meeting Lees
escorted tho Commissioners through* the
several branches of the department, point
ing out the needs and making some valu
able suggestions.
The Commissioners will meet again tbls

PARTNERS MAY COMPROMISE.
Troubles of Hilmer, BredhofE &
Schulz May Bs Settled To-Day.
There was a promise of, a sensational
turn In tha copartnership quarrel of Hil
mer, BredhofC & Schulz last night. Schulz
was prepared, by advice of his counsel,
George D. Collins, to descend on the prem
ises on California street and arrest the
members of Morse's patrol who might be
found there on the ground that they were
violating the injunction in favor of
Schulz. But the affair took a turn that
may lead to a compromise to-day. Other
wise the assets of the concern and the
good will under the order of Judge Daln
gerfield made yesterday will be sold by
John Dunker, who has been named as v
commissioner by the court. -^ .
William F. Schulz yesterday sent out a
notice advising all parties doing business
with the firm that all letters and remit
tances must be sent to room 21. Crocker
building, .which , is the office of Schulz's
attorney. In the meantime Judge Dain
gerlield made .his order that Dunker
should sell the property of the concern
Within nve days. Since the first proceed
ings there have been propositions for a
compromise.
Attorney Collins said last night that a
compromise might be reached to-day. Mr.
Collins also said that Schulz held assets
of the firm amounting to $45,000 in cash.
The outcome of the entire matter may
be two concerns, one headed by Schulz
and the other by his present partners.
SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE.
features In a conventional manner, to glva
regularity to x the nose, to make the eyes
shapely and to give archness to the mouth.
All this Lawrence did to a more or lesj
extent, though happily the merit of his
work rose above these minor blemishes.
Being successful, Lawrence now started
In on a more expensive style of living.
He took a house at 24 Old Bond street.
which he fitted up handsomely. Ho
charged 30 guineas for a head, 60 for the
half length and 120 for the full figure. In
1734 he took a house In Piccadilly and
three years later he again moved, this
time to Greek street. Soho. For thirty
years his work went on uninterruptedly,
his fame Increasing and his prices ad
vancing to formidable figures. In ISM ho
was charging 100 guineas for a head and
400 for a full length: but although re
ceiving these large sums he waa never
freefrom financial cares. The money that
came in seemed to flow out in some ex
traordinary way that has never been ac
counted for. There had been some scan
dal, rumor having connected the painter's
name with that of the Princess of Wales.
He had executed her portrait at Montagus
House, where he had rem;tined as a guest
for some time. A committee was appoint
ed to examine the charge*, and their pro
ceedings were known as the "delicate In
vestigations." .by which, however, Law
rence was fully exonerated. In ISI4 tho
Prince Regent commanded him to paint a
series of the princes, generals, statesmen
and diplomatists of the allied armies,
which now fill the Waterloo Chamber at
Windsor Castle; and in April, 1814, Law
rence was knighted by the Regent.
It Is Interesting to note that the Ameri
can Academy of Fine Arts, which had
been established in New York In ISIG, two
years later elected Sir Thomas Lawrence)
an honorary member, in return for which
he presented It with a portrait of West,
the American president of the English
Royal Academy. Otiier honors, perhaps
of a more substantial nature, followed,
for the King of France sent him In 1525
the Cross of the Legion of Honor, and he
was elected to the Academies of Flor
ence, Venice, Rome. Bologna, Denmark
and Vienna. It was not until ISI9 that
Lawrence went to Rome, then the Mecca
of artists, and here he studlod for thÂ©
first time the works of the great masters
in the galleries. On his return to London
In March, 133>, West having died earlier
In the month, he found he had been elect
ed a3 his successor as president of the
Royal Academy. He lived for ten years to
enjoy this distinction, dying suddenly on
the 7th of January, ISUO. from ossification
of the heart, and he was buried In St.
Pauls Cathedral by the side of Sir Joshua
Reynolds.
Lawrence's best remembered works are
portraits of women and children, whom
he drew and painted with a delicacy and
grace which few men have excelled. One
of his finest is of Lady Gower, with her
little daughter, which now hangs at Staf
ford House. This, with many others, ia
widely known through engravings. He
was an intimate friend of Mrs. Slddons,
the great actress, whose portrait he paint
ed several times, and of her niece. Fanny
Kemble, whom, he also painted, and which,
is one of his best canvases. Although
throughout his life Lawrence showed the
lack of preliminary training in an acad
emic way, and one may pick flaws now
and then in his drawing, he was singular
ly gifted and waa a workman of a high
order, with a delightful appreciation of
color and an abiding sense of grace and
beauty. He remains one of the notable
group of the early Kr.glishmen whose Ilka
Great Britain has not produced since his
death.

Yesterday afternoon General Shafter
sent on to Adjutant General Corbln at
Washington a draft for J5434 50, the con
tributions to the Lawton fund from the
people of this coast. The amount men
tioned does not represent the amount the
contributions will finally make up, for
there Is a sufficient sum reported now on
its way to General Shafter to make the
final total $10,121 68, and. there may be more
even after that.
Of this amount J3965 was secured by the
efforts of the citizens' committee ; that
took such a deep Interest In the matter,
and 11350 Is due to the efforts of Mr.
Mlchels of the firm of Greenebaura, Weil
& Mlchels. The remainder Is due to the
personal efforts of General Shafter. It Is
considered an excellent response from the
people of this coast, and General Shafter
has expressed much satisfaction over the
result.

WASHINGTON, Jan. B.â The Lawton
home fund is attaining noble proportions,
and General Corbin is of the opinion that
there is now in sight about $55,000. The
contributions turned In since noon on Sat
urday, or reported, amount to $18,976, mak
ing the grand total at noon to-day $67,409.
General Corbin says that in addition to
this it is reported to him that there is a
fund of $10,000 in San Franciaco and an
other of $6000 in New York not yet turned
In, and there is no doubt that other sums
will be reported.

Colonel Freeman of the Twenty-fourth
Infantry, commandant o.f the PreslJio,
will probably be one of the passengers on
the Tartar when she leaves here to-mor
row. There has been no order to that ef
fect issued so far, but there is pretty cer
tain to be one before the vessel sails.
Should Colonel Freeman go on the Tar
tar the command of the Presidio will de
volve on Major Cowles of the Seventeenth
Infantry, who 13 now in command of the
casual detachment there, he being the se
nior officer under Colonel Freeman. As
he Is a casual officer, however. It Is not
likely he will hold the position longer than,
it takes to bring some other officer from
elsewhere. Rumor now connects the name
of Major Rucker of the Fourth Cavalry,
but his assignment will probably jest
upon the result of an application for a
transfer and exchange sent In by him and
Major Rogers of the Sixth Cavalry. Mafor
Rogers was a captain In the Fourth Cav
alry, and he has but recently been pro
moted to be a major in the Sixth. He
has been with the Fourth, however, ever
since he left West Point, and whÂ«n he
was promoted to the Sixth he immediately
commenced negotiations with Mnjor
Ruckerto- trade places. Major Rucker is
willing, and if the change be made 1 It Is
believed he will be ordered to the Pre
sidio, particularly as two troops of thpf
regiment,. F and G, form part or the pres
ent garrison, and there is now no field of
ficer.of cavalry with them.

*
PEBSONAL DISCUSSION THEN IS
EXPECTED.
Commissioner Kasson, the negotiator of
reciprocity treaties between the United
States and foreign countries, will soon re
ceive a personally presented petition, in
Â¦which the fruit canners of the State and
dealers in California canned goods have
united in asking him, in negotiating trea
ties with foreign countries, to give due
consideration to the necessity for Increas
ing the exports of California canned fruit,
which the petition declares can only be
done by material reductions in the tariff
placed on said goods by foreign countries.
This petition was in circulation among
the downtown business houses yesterday
and received the signatures of the follow
ing in a very short time: Loula Sloss,
California Canneries Company (Limited)
Code-Portwood Canning Company, Cali
fornia Fruit Canners' Association, Grirnth-
Dunne Company, California Fruit Pre
serving Company, Charles \V. Pike & Co.,
Field Mercantile Company, Johnson-Locke
Mercantile Company, American Trading
Company, Hooper & Jennings, Haas
Bros, and Girvin & Kyre.
Isldor Jacobs, managing director of the
California Canneries Company (Limited), is
circulating the petition. He is about to go
to Europe, stopping at Washington on the
way, whero he will seek an interview with
Commissioner Kasson. The petition, In
addition to the appeal made to the Com
missioner, asks the members of the Cali
fornia Congressional delegation "to use
their very best efforts with J. A. Kasson,
to the end that in all reciprocity treaties
negotiated by him or about to be nego
tiated with foreign countries, the Interest
of California fruits may be looked after,
so as to increase the business so neces
sary to the future development of the
Industry."
The basis of these requests Is the re
sertion of the fact that "the California
canned fruit business Is capable of im
mense expansion In foreign countries pro
vided that a reasonable tariff can be
placed upon the goods by foreign coun
tries; and th^t the jtrade with foreign
countries Is much restricted by reason of
the excessive ' tariff, thereby directly in
juring the Industry, as -well as directly In
juring the fruit-growing Industry or the
State; and that in nearly all foreign coun
tries, except England, the said tariff
placed on the said goods amounts to more
than tlws actual value of the goods."
Last year Mr. Jacobs, accompanied by
Morris Marks of Newcastle, Eng., an Eng
lish director of the California Canneries
Company (Limited) visited Germany and
looked about with a view of enlarging the
market for California products abroad.
Mr. Jacobs had an interview with United
States Minister White at Beriln, who ad
vised him to return to the United States
and talk with Commissioner Kasson. This
was the first intimation that Kasson waa
negotiating a reciprocity treaty with Ger
many. â¢ Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Marks found
the field for California fruits to be good
in Germany if the duty could be reduced.
Mr. Marks, who is now In this city, said
yesterday to a reporter of The Call:
'"Germany ought, to take as much Cali
fornia canned fruit as England does. Tha
people in Germany have learned to like
It #md call for It. There Is some trade
there for California canne/l fruit now, but
nothing like what It would be if the de
sired reduction In duties can be made. The
duty amounts to just about the value of
the goods. California has a big stake In
thn matter. Last year the export of Cali
fornia canned goods to Great Rrltaln
amounted to $3,000,000 In rmmd figures. The
German Importation would be as much
If the duty Is lowered to the proper fig
ure. The growth of the California canned
goods trade In Great Britain indicates
what can be done. Last year the total
was 650,000 cases, as against 335.12S cases
In IS9B and 95,817 cases in 1894.
Mr. Marks will call on Commissioner
Kasson with Mr. Jaoobs and the latter
will present the petition of the canners for
consideration. , Â»Â¦..Â¦-;-

XLâ SIR THOMAS LA WHENCE.
Nature seems to take pleasure In be
stowing her gifts when it comes to the
matter of esthetic endowments In the
most capricious manner and where they
are least expected. Many men have devel
oped talents for artistic things whose en
vironment and heredity would seem to dis
bar them from ever aspiring to a lovÂ«
of the beautiful or a taste for the refined.
So It v.-as with tho great Englishman
Thomas Lawrence. He was tho son of
an innkeeper, who wandered about from
pillar to post, now In one town, then In
another, never successful, and content
when his little boy showed a precocious
talent for drawing to set him up on tho
bar and have him. at the age of 5. make
charcoal sketches of thÂ« customers.
With very rare exceptions men who
achieve distinction In art begin at an
early age the labor which Is so Intimate
a part of their lives, since, as with scarce
ly any other professional men, the painter
never for a moment ceases to think of his
own work. In order to accomplish great
things In art there are many preliminary
matters to be considered, and such ques
tions as technique, drawing, composition
mense fancy to the young man; ha
had himself, his Queen and the Princes*
Amelia painted by Lawrence and lie went
so far in his favoritism as to insist by a
royal edict on having him made an asso
ciate of the Royal Academy when he had
barely attained his majority, although by
the laws of the institution he was not
rrally eligible until the age of 24.
Three years later Lawrence was elect
ed full academician and twelve month*
afterward he was made painter in ordi
nary to his Majesty. He waa now the
most popular portratt painter that Lon
don had known since the days of Van
Dyck, when that prince of the brush had
his studio constantly filled with the moat
brilliant set of fashionables from tha
King down. Unhappily, however, the pat
ronage of royalty la not always an un
mixed joy or entirely conducive to trua
artistic advancement. The flattery that
finds Its vent through the courtler"a
tongue is not unlikely to percolate from
the end of the painter's brush. Be sura
that Lawrence did full Justice to the phys
iognomy of his royal sitter and did not
hesitate to smooth over hi 3 shortcomings
in a physical way. Besides, it waa also
the faahion at that epoch to draw the

It was then discovered that the re

under the original suit and had never

the trust company, which made the dis
missal of the first cult Impossible with
out jeopardizing the Interests of the

The same ]K>ir.t was made in the suit
of the trust company, which, had It
been allowed, woula have made it impos
sible for C. H. Smith to have tested the
validity of the $2!>0.000 worth of claimed
:i:eÂ£ai bonds. Judge Morrow held that
Smith had a perfect right to Intervene,
ti.nd overruled the motion.
It was then charged that Charles H.
Smith did not own the bonds that he rep
resented in these suits, and the asser
tion was made that Uaey belonged to the
?-slate of Captain Smith, instead of to j
Charles H. Smith, and that the eon had I
secured them as against the Interests of J

and the mechanical manipulation of the

and worries that preclude mastership.
So, In looking over the list of the world's
' great artists, we find that most of them
were well equipped at a time when mod
ern men are still at the schools. Law
rence drew creditably when he was 10
years old, and, although he had no in
struction, he seemed to get at his results
by Intuition, as It were, from the first.
Later he went for^a while to the schools
I at the Royal Academy, but he did not
| linger long there, and it may be said that
! he practically earned his living from the
I time he was 10 years of age.
Thomas Lawrence was born in Bristol.
England, on May 4, 1769, where his father
at that time kept a hotel, although he
came of people In fair social standing. But
the father of the painter was a sort of
ne'er do well and of a roving disposition,
so that he went from Bristol to Oxford,
thence to Bath, following the fashionable
world, trying to find sitters for his little
boy, who was considered a phenomenon
with the chalks, and who drew rfnybody
willing to give up a few shillings for the
work. The lad was good looking and re
ceived a great deal of attention, which did
not turn his head, however, and he had a
certain vogue even at this early period
among prominent people traveling thither
j for the baths or amusement. There re
i mains, done at this time in colored
i chalks, an old portrait of the Duches3 of
Devonshire, which still hangs in Chls
wlck House, In the room In which Charles
Fox died. Then, as all through his career,
he was a faithful worker, applying him
self with great enthusiasm, and presently.
In 1757, he came to London for the first
! time. He was now In his eighteenth year,
and Is . described as being handsome in
person, with bright eyes, regular fea
tures and long, brown hair falling over
his shoulders in curia. He took rooms in
Leicester Fields, near Sir Joshua Rey
nolds, whom he little thought he was one
day to succeed as president of the Royal
( Academy.
The genial Sir Joshua was very friend
ly to the young man and gave him much
kindly advice. "At first he was carried
away by the prevailing classicism of the
day, for it was a time in England when
it was the fashion to dress modern heroes
up In Roman togas and pose them before
great columns and curtains, on marble
benches or. in. the environment of the old
Caesarian times. Features were painted
with an aggravating regularity and lack
of character that In these days It is dif
ficult to account for. There was stlltedness
In the pose and a pomposity that did not
escape being ridiculous. This custom pre
vailed as well in France and may be said
to have culminated with the work of the
painter David. Thus It was that Law
rence's first effort was a commission to
paint a picture called "Homer Reciting
His Poems to the Greeks." The work was
exhibited in 1791 and was not a success.
The year before, however, he had exe
cuted a portrait of the beautiful Miss
Farren, the actress, who later married
Lord Derby, and with this canvas he
immediately attracted great attention
among the critics of the day and the
fashionable world of -London. It paved the
way for many subsequent commissions,
for It was the portrait of the year at the
exhibltion. The opportunity was most Ta
vorable for Lawrence. Gainsborough had
died two years before. Sir Joshua was old
and nearly blind and Romney had but a
small following.

The Toyo Kisen Kalsha's steamer Hong
kong Maru arrived from the Orient via
Honolulu early yesterday morning. Sho
brought up thirteen cabin and eight sec
ond class, passengers, besides fifty-three
Chinese In the steerage. Though she had
neither freight nor passengers from
Honolulu, she had to join the Algoa in
quarantine. Quarantine Officer Kinyoun
Is taking no chances and not a vessel that
comes from Hawaii will be allowed to
dock until every . rat aboard has been
killed. The rodents are more to be feared
than a man with the plague. The latter
can be guarded against, but once a rat
gets ashore with the bacilli there Is no
telling where the disaster will end.
Lung Kal Chew, the prominent Chinese
revolutionist, was a passenger on board
the Hongkong Maru, but stopped off at
Honolulu. He had discarded his Chineso
garb for Caucasian clothing and was
traveling under a Japanese passport aa
B. Kashibara.
The bark Albert came In from Honolulu
yesterday and was sent to Join the Hong
kong Maru and Algoa In quarantine. The
Falls of Clyde, which arrived from Hilo,
was not quarantined.
The Hartford was the center of attrac
tion on the front yesterday. The his
toric old ship looks like a yacht, and
with her formidable battery of modern
guns would be able to give a good ac
count of herself In any company. She
will probably go to sea to-morrow on a
trial cruise, and on her return will fit out
for the voyage to New York. Yesterday
the apprentice boys were given a sail
drill, and the way in which they put a
full working suit of canvas on the sioop
of war made the sailors on the British
merchantmen give vent to many marks
of approbation.
The French bark General Neumayer,
which it was feared had gone ashore near
the Horn in the October storms, reached
port early yesterday morning. The vessi-l
was IS6 days out from Swansea and 29
per cent reinsurance was paid on her by
the underwriters. Of the other overdues
the A. G. Ropes from New York had to
put Into Port Stanley with her rudder
post twisted; the Musselerag from Ant
werp is coming via the Cape of Good
Hopt. having lost a suit of sails and had
her bulwarks damaged and decks swept
off the Horn; the Canrobert from Ham
burg put into Valparaiso short of water;
the Blackbraes from Newcastle, Eng., put
Into Port Stanley with tho loss of a suit
of sails and with her steering gear dam
aged; the Emllie Galluie from Swansea
put Into Rio de Janeiro partially dismast

Sound put into Hongkong dismasted and
with her decks started. All the ships that
have arrived and are now due have had
a fearful time of It during Ocrober.
The Oceanic steamship Company's Aus

The Chilean ship Hlndostan came into

Troop O of the Sixth Cavalry, stationed
at the Presidio, secured the son of Mr.
Sommer, chief clerk to the post quarter
master, as a recruit last week. Roy Som

brought up among the troops and would
have joined the service long before this
if his parents had not objected. He is
particularly enamored of the cavalry arm.
A college chum, George Hart, enlisted
with him, and both are going to try for
commissions. Both boys are about 19
years old.
The contract of Acting Assistant Sur

he has been ordered to proceed to his
home In this city.
The detachment of men from the hos

on the transport Tartar will go down
there on the next mail steamer instead of
on a transport, as it Is the evident inten

of the plague has passed. The Tartar
will stop at Guam Instead of at Honolulu.

Success Is Already in Sight of the Agitation
Started by the Mothers' Union of

LABOR COMMISSIONER MEYERS IS STILL WAITING.
California Club Joins the Crusade and Its Members Will Make
Individual Appeals to the Merchants to Provide Seats
for Their Female Employes.
THERE Is hope for the saleslady
and the shopgirl. The agitation In
their behalf, started by the Moth
ers' Union of Golden Gate, is
spreading. Women who Interest
themselves in the welfare- of their ] sex
are taking hold of the matter with a de
termination that cannot fall of success.
The law which says that merchants em
ploying female help must provide seats
for their employes' use is receiving their
attention. It is going to amount to some
thing if the women have their way. A
quiet inspection of the stores of San Fran
cisco is one of the things that the crusad
ers contemplate. Any proprietor who Is
not treating his lady clerks as the law
and humanity demand will be requested
to get In line. There will be no foolishness
about it. Just one polite request and the
merchant who does not take the hint will
learn of his mistake soon enough.
It may be said to the credit of the pro
prietors of most of the leading stores of
the city that they have no objection to the
enforcement of the law, but there are
some who do not take kindly to any In
novation that might add to the comfort
of their employes. These are the people
on whom the women have their eyes.
They have chairs behind their counters,
but woe to the clerk who has the temerity
to rest. The eeats are for ornamental pur
poses only and to make a show of com
plying with the law. Girls employed In
these etores dare not talk of their mis
treatment. Their mouths are closed with
the fear of dismissal. Their positions
would be the price of their complaints.
These are the women for whom the
Mothers' Union has taken a stand and
for the securing of whose rights the la
dies of this city will lend their assistance.
These are the women whom Labor Com
missioner Meyers uses as the excuse for
his deplorable inactivity. Mr. Meyers is
waiting for complaints and he knows that
these girls dare not make them. They
have hoped against hope that he would
some day realize his duty and perform It.
In that was their only anticipation of re
lief until the Mothers' Union took up the
battle for them.
The latter Is acting while Mr. Meyers is
still waiting for complaints, although it
cannot be said ho is not agitated â what
about is one of the secrets of his ofllce,
but It is presumed that It Is either over
his own inactivity or the idea that it has
been suggested that he should take a pre
paratory course In the duties of a Labor
Commissioner.
Shopgirls will not have to complain to
the women who have undertaken to help
them and it will not be very long before
they will be able to take a bit of rest
whert they are not busy without fear of
losing their positions.
So much for the agitation started by the
mothers of the other side of the bay.
From the aspect of things It appears that
their fight waa all but won when they
adopted the resolutions that have attracted
the attention of the women of the State,
and apprised the Labor Commissioner of
the fact that his duty Is not to wait but
to work. The ladles, however, will not bo
satisfied with their fight until they have
clinched the victory.' They are going right
along with their plan of campaign just as
though success was not already in sight.
On this side of the bay the crusade is In
the hands of the California Club, one of
the representative women's organizations
of the State. Mrs. Lovell White, the pres
ident, brought the matter up at a meeting
hold yesterday afternoon. Every member
warmly commended the Mothers' Union
for the action It had taken and enthusias
tically placed their services at the com
mand of the union. For the reason that
the club has In hand the preservation of
Telegraph Hill It was not thought advis
able to take up the shopgirl subject us a
body until the efforts to save the old
landmark are completed.'
"We are heartily In sympathy with the
movement In favor of the women clerks."
said Mrs. Lovell White, "and individually
our members aro going to use their Influ
ence to get the merchants with whom
they trade to comply with the law and
provide their employes with seats for use
when they aro disengaged. On the theory
that with too many Irons in the fire none
of them get hot, the club did not think it
advisable, as a body, to agitate the mat
ter. I do not think that our members will
have any difficulty in bringing the mer
chants around to our way of thinking."
Resolutions were adopted congratulating
the Mothers' Union and expressing the
sentiments suggested by Mrs. White.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1900.
WAR BETWEEN
BILL-POSTERS
ENDS AT LAST
Two Rival Firms Have
Consolidated.
AFFECTS PROPERTY OWNERS
OWENS & VARNT3Y AND SIEBE &
GREEN CALL IT OFF.
After Losing Barrels of Money They
Conclude to Stop Fighting and
Join Their Interests â A
Bitter Contest.
The merry w ar between the rival bill
posters which has raged In this city with
more or less Intensity and bitterness of
feeling for the last four years has at last
leen called oft. The news will be re
ceived with sadness by the real estate
owners who have fattened their bank ac
counts with the absurdly high rentals they
ha\e received for the use of vacant lots
on which the rival firms desired to erect
billboards. ThÂ© struggling property owner
will no longer be able to draw a $100 in
come from a $13 lot, because there wilt be
no more competition between the paste
slinging outrits, and without this competi
tion fancy rentals are impossible.
The rival firms of Siebe 6c. Green and
Owens & Varney have been consolidated
under the name of the California Bill
Posting Company, and hereafter there will
be bui one brand of paste used in San
Francisco, and the market value of vacant
lots and old barns suitable for advertis
ing purposes will suffer a serious relapse.
The members of the new firm are Fred
C Siebe, George 11. Siebe, J. Charles
Green. Thomas 11. li. Varney and Len U.
Owens.
Geurge Siebe and Len Owens will be
the inside men and Mr. Green will be the
advertising manager, but all tive are
equally interested In the business. A
member of the new firm said last night
that the losses of the two firms which
have been consolidated during the last
two years aggregated $272,w0 as the result
of the ruinous rivalry that has prevailed
between them. Now they have the whole
lield to themselves and hope to retrieve
their losses by using the a_x liberally in
cutting down rents for billboards. No In
crease in advertising rates is contemplat
ed, notwithstanding the fact that monop
olists are supposed to charge the public
all that can be squeezed out of them.
"We have a capital of a Quarter of a
million," said the member of the firm re
ferred to last night, "and our Held of
operations will include San Francisco, San
Jose, Oakland, Alameda, San Rafael,
Petaluma and Honolulu."
The light between the hill posters began
four years ago when Siebe & Green en
tered the field in opposition to the Cali
fornia Adsigns Company. The latter com
pany was rinally succeÂ«*ded by Owens &
Varney and the war continued with re
newed vigor. During the last few months
the competition between the rivals to se
cure boards on choice lots became so fierce
that enormous prices were paid until the
rents exceeded the income from adver
tisers. Of course such a ruinous condi
tion of affairs could not long continue,
and the consolidation was the natural
and practically the only outcome.

JAPANESE WRESTLERS.
Their Physical Development I 3
Something Truly Remarkable.
Although the American Is willing to>
ncede to the Japanese the possession of
a mental capacity almost. If not Quite,
equaling that of the majority of the whit*
races, he Is apt to form a somewhat
slighting opinion of him as viewed from
a physical standpoint, says the Medical
Record. The specimens met with In this
country do not tend to convey a favor
able impression of their athletic powers.
After, however, reading an account of th*
physical measurements of sonw of tho
most prominent Japanese wrestlers, a
more respectful attitude regarding tha
muscular development of these little men
â¢will probably be taken. The Jljl Shampo
has recently published a table Kivlng tha
measurements of six of the foremost Jap
anese fighters. Ftom this table It Is gath
ered that the most bulky of these modern
gladiators weighs, at the age of 22 years,
about 300 pounds; height, 54 feet: srlrth of

centimeters; upper arm. eighteen Inches.
Another one weighs over 2SO ponds;
height. 6 feet 5 Inches; girth of chest.

CHICAGO, Jan. B.â May wheat opened 4c
over Saturday at 6S**i@6S T /4c. It speedily de
veloped that there was little excuse tor such a
bold front to the market for Liverpool was not
overly steady and the small world's shipments
perhaps somewhat bullish at first glance â con
tained a potent bear factor In the Increase In
Russian shipments against a decrease from
this country. Interest was divided between the
pits and the Board of Trade annual election,
with the latter the more magnetic. May sold
off early to 6s%c, where it steadied for a time
on buying against puts. The large receipts and
the poor export demand, however, acted
against this until even that poor Bupport was
practically withdrawn. Considerable long
wheat was thrown In the market In the liqui
dation which reigned throughout the session
May slumped through puts without effort and
touched 67$Â»c. closing shortly afterward In a
weak condition. %c under Saturday at 67%#â¬Sc.
Corn was dull and easy In sympathy with
wheat. May closed a shade under Saturday at
Oats were quiet and featureless and though
the market showed some easiness In sympathy
with wheat, the close was steady May being
unchanged at 23*& c.

were firm. The market was not a large one

tery we had heavy gales of wind from SE and
heavy sea, which made the ship labor and com
menced to make much water, so the pumps had
to be ke^t going night and day. Nothing but
rales of wind all the time, so I put into th!a
port to try to stop the leak in tha ship and get
my pumps repaired, etc.

London Market.
XEW TORK, Jan. B.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The war nows was predominant all day.
General flatness marked the opening of busi
ness, causÂ«d by General White's dispatch that
he had been bard pressed. In the. American
department there was hesitation to begin busi
ness, operators dreading very low quotations.
First bids were at 1 to 1Â»^ below parity, but
Berlin sold oven at that level, although not
so heavily as on Saturday.
London sold on a email scale and no one
â¢earned to have the courage to support tha mar
ket. It remained flat until New York prices
werÂ« received, when within a quarter of an
hour the beet prices of the session were re
ceived. Then they sagged off until official con
firmation came of General White's successful
repulse of the Boer attack on Ladysmith.
This news caused such a commotion that busi
ness was almost forgotten. In the street prices
rallied to parity. African shares moved on
similar lines and other markets were more or
lees neglected, but they recovered slightly at
the close. Consols, which reached 88\i, rallied
to 98^ on the late war news and the extreme
ease of money, calls being quoted at 2>Â» per
cent.
The Bank of England boug-ht Â£439,000 in gold
eagles and Â£175,000 In German coin. A con
tinental demand for gold Is developing at 77s
>%<1 | S77b 9Vid. Good Paris advices Bay that a
large shipment of Russian gold is coming to
London this week. It is known that recent
German arrivals comprised Russian gold, that
country, owing to poor crops, having bought
considerable breadstufTs abroad.
Paris cheque to-day was 25.23; Berlin cheque,
20.49.

21Union Officers Installed.
California Union No. 1 of the Brick
layers' and Masons' International Union
of America Installed its officers last night
at ilÂ£9 Mission street. The attendance
was large and the utmost good fellow
ship prevailed during the entire evening.
After the new officers had been Inducted
JÂ» to . l heir respective chairs a recess was
declared, in which light refreshments
wÂ«*re. rartaken of by the members and
thHr Invited friends.
The executive committee, to whom was
referred the so-called strike on the new
pofitoflicp, reported that the trouble grew
out of the local unions, which undertook
to classify tho International union as a
6cab organization and in consequence
tried to call out the cement workers. The
action of the local unions waa charac
terized as being unwarranted in the face
of the fact that Union No. 1 holds a char
ter from the International Union of
America and is consequently in full fel
lowship with all State and Territorial or
ganizations throughout the United States.
The secretary stated that he had com
municated with thi- parent organization
in Rochester. N. V., and expected that
body to take notice of the action of the
lo Â£t" Â°JPf nlz atlons in this matter.
The following are the officers installed:
President John P Fitzgerald; vice presi
dent Pat Coan; financial secretary! Ous
Ha.en; corresponding secretary W D
Pickens. and treasurer, Thomas' Fltzger-
Polytechnic School Exercises.
The junior term at Cogswell's Poly
technic School closed yesterday with ap
propriate exercises. Miss Rose Stolberjr
reflected great credit on the school and
her teacher, Arthur A. Macurda. by the
manner in which she discussed the prin

REV. GUY SMITH
UPHELD IN HIS
DIVORCE ACTION
Warmly Defended by
Fellow Pastors.
SEPARATION IS JUSTIFIED
â ?
EXDEB GIBBS STRONG IN HIS
COMMENDATION.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway, Jan. 8.
The sensational divorce suit of Rev.
Guy W. Smith, pastor of the First Chris
tion Church, against Laura M. Smith of
Nebraska, the details of which were first
given publicity in to-day's Call, has cre
ated a very decided stir in church cir
cles.
The revelation of the fact that the
young pastor is suing his wife for a
separation, not alone on the ground of
desertion, as the plaintiff would allege,
but by reason of the discovery of a fam
ily relationship existing between the par
ties, was received with universal sur
prise.
Rev. Mr. Smith remained away from
his home on Sycamore street to-day, and
he has vowed never to tell any
thing further concerning his domestic af
fairs. He feels keenly hla unfortunate
predicament.
"1 have absolutely nothing more to
say." declared Rev. Mr. Smith to-day.
"The Etory Is all in The Call to-day and
I do not wish to be quoted further in
the matter. I have nothing to affirm and
nothing to deny, but I believe that I have
been honorable in my actions. It is all
very unfortunate."
Glenn McWilliams, evangelist and sec
retary of the Ministerial Association of
the Christian Church for the Northern
District, is one of Rev. Mr. Smith's
warmest admirers. He said to-day: "In
the first place, I was very much sur
prised to read of this sensational divorce
suit. As God is my judge, 1 knew noth
ing of this affair, and 'Ihe Call was my
informant. It is most unfortunate, but 1
feel that Brother Smith will come out on
top. Rev. Mr. Smith has my implicit con
fidence as a Christian minister. I believe
he will do what is just in the interest of
God and his family. This young minister
has my deepest sympathy and the course
he is taking, I trust, will prove for the
best. So far as I know. Rev. Mr. Smith
is a perfect gentlemanâ a man with clean
lips and clean hands."
There is some feeling among the pas.
tor's congregation over the fact that the
affair was guarded with such great se
crecy by the official church board. "ThÂ«
members should have been apprised of
this affair before this," said one old par
ishioner, "and it was not Just right that
the official board should have held the
matter from the congregation. We all no
ticed for a long time that our pastor was
laboring under some great mental an
guish, and we ought to have been told, so
that the strain might have been re
lieved."
Klder W. T. Gibbs, chairman of the of
ficial- board of Rev. Mr. Smith's church,
said: "When Rev. Mr. Smith first came
to take charge of our church I soon saw
that he appeared to possess some great
object of grief, but we always have found
him an honorable man. In fact, should
we have found him other than that we
should have made .quick work of the case.
You remember the Rev. Edwards Davis'
double sommersaults on the rostrum. W6
finished his antics up very promptly. Of
course, many of the Davis faction left
our church' at the time, but the better
class of that faction has since returned.
"Of course, Mr. Smith explained his
whole trouble to us before he commenced
ills suit. His resignation was ulso ten
dered at the same time. He was sincere
in his feeling that it might be to the best
Interests of our church to resign, but we
refused to accept it. Mr. Smith is an
honorable man, and when the case has
gone through the court and the truth
comes to light, he'll be on top."
Testimony in the divorce action proba
bly will be taken some time this week.
TWO OLD PEOPLE
LIBERATED FROM
LUNACY CHARGE
Wife and Neighbors
Caused Trouble.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Jan. 8.
James Shields, the 77-year-old resident
of San Leandro who was charged with
insanity by his aged wife last Saturday,
was dismissed from custody by the
Lunacy Commission to-day. The only
thing found to be troubling him was a
violent temper, which is aggravated by
the equally irascible disposition of his
spouse.
Mrs. Shields acknowledged to the doc
tors that her husband was not insane but
was simply suffering from an inclination
to be quarrelsome. She denied that tOie
made him sleep in the basement, but said
that she would like to have him placed
in some public institution for the purpose
of having domestic hostilities ceaso in
her residence.
"You can come home," remarked Mrs.
Shields to her husband when he was dis
charged.
"All right," responded the old fellow.
"I guess I will, but before I do I think
I'd better make my will."
The couple have been married nearly
half a century and have led a tempes
tuous marital existence for many years.
They are both well known in San Lean
dro," where they became prominent be
cause of their imbroglios.
Miss Lucy Sequeira, the ancient spin
ster farmer of Haywards, was released
from the insane ward of the Receiving
Hospital to-day as no one appeared to
press the charge of lunacy against her.
Ex-Judge Nye, who represented the pa
tient, said that his client is the owner of
a ranch in Cow Canyon which is worth
about $3000 and that some of her Portu
guese neighbors were coveting It. For
that reason, he declared, the charge of
insanity had been preferred against he*.
The woman said that she had become
tired of living among such people and will
return to her native country as soon as
she can dispose of her property.
lar meeting, which will take place in
about thirty days.
The San Bernardino, Arrowhead and
Waterman Company presented a petitiou,
asking to be excused from making re
ports to the commission, because it. is a
private corporation and does not keep its
lumber and mining accounts separate
from it? railroad accounts. The petition
was referred to Commissioner Blackstock
for action.
The Los Angeles Terminal Railroad pre
sented its new passenger tariff for the
consideration of the board. In a letter
accompanying it, General Manager Hynes
stated the company had decided not to
convert the line into an electric road, and
asked the Commissioners to approve the
new passenger rates, which, he said,
were the same as those of the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe under like condi
tions.
This matter was postponed until this
afternoon's meeting.
TRANSIT COMPANY
EMPLOYES WANT
WAGES ADVANCED
Petition Presented to
Directors.
"OAKLAND. Cal.. Jan. 2, 190f>.
"To the Honorable Board of Di
rectors and the Hon. Mr. Kelley,
general manager of the Oakland
Transit "Company of the City of
Oakland, Alameda County:
"Gentlemenâ We, the undersijrn
ed employes of the various divis
ions of the Oakland Transit Com
pany, controlled by yourselves, do
respectfully submit the following
prayer and petition:
"We would respectfully ask, ow
ing to the great advance in all the
necessary commodities of life, that
our wages be Increased accordingly
to 22 cents per hour. We find that
It Is impossible to live in the man
ner in which we should, according
to the work which we perform. We
are actually compelled to deny our
selves and families many of the ne
cessities of life.
"During the last few years, when
business was at a standstill and
ruin glared this country in the face,
we quietly and without protesta
tion submitted to several reductions
in wages. Now that this crisis has
passed, we conscientiously think
that we should enjoy one of the
privileges accorded employes of
other trades and professions, viz.,
an increase in our pay.
"You must know that in order to
faithfully serve as a street car em
ploye a man must be conscientious,
sober and of good education, and
these are a recommendation for
good wages.
"Gentlemen, we submit it to your
worthy consideration and an In
crease in our wages will be greatly
appreciated and received with
many thanks by your humble peti
tioners."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. S.
The employes of the Oakland Transit
Company have asked that their wages be
increased from 20 cents an hour to 22
cents, and the above petition was to-day
presented to Secretary S. J. Taylor of
that company with the request that it be
laid before the board of directors. The
petition has been signed by nearly every
employe of the road.
There is no threat of strike in the peti
tion, but it is based upon the ground
that wages were reduced some years ago
under the pressure of hard times, and
now that times have improved they want
wages returned to the former schedule.
The men are relying upon the fact that
practically every employe of the system
has signed the petition, and there are
about 200 names attached thereto. The
men say that less than a dozen men re
fused to sign the request.
This is a distinctly new move in the ef
fort of employes to secure increased com
pensation from employing corporations.
Heretofore the threat of strike has al
ways been held over the head of the cor
poration. This time the request is made
in plain petition form, and is based upon
the trade conditions that exist. The men
disclaim any effort at coercion, and mere
ly say that they want what they had be
fore and what will enable them to live
comfortably. Â¦[.'''
If this is granted it will increase the
wages of each man about 20. cents a day,
or *T>o a day for the corporation.

legal contest between the Fresno Canal

share of the water. The Kings River has
furnished all the water by which the
plains of Fresno are irrigated and the
rival companies have In the past had a

Rev. Guy Smith's Circular, Which Attracted Much Attention.
ARPER, LOCAL
OIL KING, NOW
SUED FOR LIBEL
Smith & Baxter Ask
Heavy Damages.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 8.
The strained business relations that
have for a long time past existed between
George W. Arper, the local coal oil king,
and the former retail firm of Smith &
Baxter to-day culminated in a $20,000 libel
suit.
The suit was filed in the Superior Court
late this afternoon, J. E. Smith and J. M.
Baxter appearing as plaintiffs against
Arper. According to the complaint drawn
up by Attorneys Goodcell & Mendenhall
and Chapman and Clift the basis of the
suit is an alleged scurrilous circular letter
Issued early last year by Arper. The com
plaint recites:
"That in January, ISS9. defendant ma
liciously and with intent to harass, Injure
and annoy plaintiffs in their retail coal
oil and gasoline business, published and
circulated In the city of Oakland and vicin
ity a certain libelous, false and unprivi
leged printed circular concerning plain
tiffs. â¢ â¢ â¢ That said circular exposed
plaintiffs, as partners, to hatred, contempt,
ridicule and obloquy and caused them to
be shunned and avoided, and had a ten
dency to injure them in their business and
in their reputation and standing as busi
ness men. â¢ â¢ * That they were obliged
to abandon and discontinue their business
and wholly lose the same, and they were
subjected to suffer hatred, contempt, ridi
cule and obloquy. All of which was ma
liciously designed and intended by defend
ant, through and by means of said false
and libelous publication. That by afore
said acts of defendant plaintiffs were
damaged In the sum of $20,000."
The circular complained of as libelous
Is one issued about a year ago. The cap
tion reads: "Coal oil and gasoline. Smith
& Baxter assign to George W. Arper.
Why? A plain statement. Please read."
Then follows a statement regarding Arper
leasing his retail business to the plaintiffs
and the provisions of the lease and the
"favorable opportunity Smith & Baxter
had to run said business In a way that If
they did right they could afford to buy
It." Plaintiffs claim that the circular
charges them with fraud and falsifying.
Together with the complaint was filed an
undertaking for costs in the sum of $500,
with V. H. Renner and J. A. McNaughton
as sureties.

WITHDREW HIS
SUIT BECAUSE
OF NO ALIMONY
Murmurs of the Tied
Aired in Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 8.
There was unusual activity in the Ala
meda County divorce courts to-day. The
murmurs of the tied were exceedingly au
dible and several important rulings were
made.
Frank F-nos Pericra. late of Haywards,
appeared before Judge Ellsworth to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt in having neglected to pay his
wife alimony pending his divorce suit,
brought on the ground of desertion. Over
1200 back alimony had accumulated and
when the Sheriff levied execution the of
ficer found but JS belonging to the
delinquent and half of this went as
fees. Periera, as he appeared
adorned in a natty suit, paradise
collar and crimson tie, explained
that he only earned $2 a day and could't
afford to pay alimony. Judge Ellsworth
was not to be trifled with and ordered
that Periera either pay or go to jail. In
stead he was permitted to withdraw his
divorce suit and a reconciliation will fol
low.
Of James Munro of Alameda. who is
being: sued for a divorce by Matilda Mun
ro. Judge Ellsworth asked how It was that
if he received 1100 monthly salary as en
gineer for the Spring Valley Water Com
pany he could not afford to pay $40 ali
mony pending the euit. "I have clothes to
buy and owe some debts," replied defend
ant. "Don't let me hear that again," re
torted the court. "First you should sup
port your family and then pay your debts
afterward." Defendant was* given until
Monday to pay up.
Judge Hall this afternoon granted Geor
gia P. Hunt a divorce from Charles O. A.
Hunt on the ground of extreme cruelty,
giving her the custody of the two minor
children. Mrs. Hunt had testified that
her husband's cruelty consisted chiefly of
staying out late of nights and that he
played cards. In granting the decree
Judge Hall virtually overruled Judge Og
den's celebrated decision that wives are
not permitted to inquire into the where
abouts of belated husbands and are en
joined from delivering curtain lectures;
but Judge Hall made no comments that
might be exploited in print.
May E. White, who sued Fred M. White
for a divorce on the ground of desertion,
was denied a decree by Judge Hall. It ap
peared from the testimony that the par
tits formerly resided in Minneapolis and
that the defendant husband had supplied
his wife with funds to pay her fare to
California and here prosecute her divorce
suit.
ASSISTANCE WAS
NOT IN TIME TO
SHE HIS LIFE
Fowles Struggled Till
Exhausted.
AI.AMEPA. Jan. B.â The body of a man
was found floating In the bay in the vicin
ity of the narrow-gauge mole this morn
ing. Papers found In the pockets of the
clothing identify it as that of Stephen
Feroies, proprietor of the Association bar
l>c-r-i-hop, 214 Mason street. Sail Francisco.
The body is undoubtedly that of the
m;vn whose cries for help were heard un
tier ihe wharf by D. Ghilieri, a car
â¢ leaner, on the night of December 23. It
was found near the place whence the ap
peals came. Gbilieri heard a man's faint
< Ties and attempted rescue, but the strugr
tllng unfortunate apparently became ex
nausted and sank before a^sl>taÂ«ce
reached him. Ghilieri's story was at nret
<!-iubted and he was thought to have mls
:aken the voices of hunters, but he in
Â£gd that hU drowns theory wÂ« cor-
The fact that a watch taken from thÂ«
clothing had stopped a few minutes after
:Â¦ now bear* out Ghilieri'u story, as that
was about the time he heard the cries.
from the pockets of the clothing were
laken a card of the Association barber-
Ebop. ZU Mason street, Stephen I-owles,
rroprletor. formerly v.ith the Olympic
<'lub; a notice from the San Francisco
<Jas and Electric Company, the name an-1
address written In being S. Fowle*. 717
McAllister street; a silver matchbox bear
tag the initials S*. F. f and a receipt for
<-;ues from a lodee of Odd Fellows to
Stephen Fowle.Â«. the name of which was
almost obliterated. Through these the
rlead man's Identity Is conclusively estab
lished.
A black coat and vest, pray trousers
with fine strtpe. tan shoes, a light over
coat *nd a shirt with a red stripe, with
cuffs, collar and a club tie completed the
ilr^ss of the dead man. In addition to the
.'irticks referred to there were founA in
ihe pockets a pearl -hand led pocket-knife,
key rlnc and one key and a dime. De
craped was about 5 feet R Inches in height
snd somewhat stout. His hair was black
and his face smooth-shaven.
No ore has as yet appeared to Identify
the body. How the unfortunate man came
to mori his fate is difficult of explanation,
and no satisfactory theory has been ad
vaned as to the probable cause. He may
liave fallen or jumped from the ferry as It
s;pproa<'hed the slip. The fact that he
cried for help and was so near the wharf
comewhat refutes the suicide theory.

there has been such a huge amount of
smoke, so dense and' offensive, that I

THE recently appointed Park Commis
sion, consisting of A. B. Spreckels,
Frederick W. Zelle, Reuben H.
Lloyd, John A. Stanton and Jasper
McDonald, met in the lodge at Golden
Gate Park yesterday afternoon and or
ganized.
The session was prolonged but entirely
harmonious. On motion of R. H. Lloyd.
A. B. Spreckels was chosen president of
the new commission. Phil Fay Jr. was
appointed secretary of the board. Miss
M. B. Fairman, former secretary, was
appointed to the position of bookkeeper.
The secretary's compensation was tixeil
at 5125 per month and that of bookkeeper
at *100 per month.
Under the new charter the Park Com
missioners have supervision and control
of all the plazas and squares ai well as
the Golden Gate Park, hence the respon

creased. Hereafter the Commissioners
will meet at least twice a month.
THEY INSTALLED THE
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS
EX-DISTRICT ATTORNEY MURPHY
formally installed his successor,
Lewis F. Byington, in the office of
public prosecutor yesterday at noon.
At the hour when the provision? of the
new organic law went into force Mr.
Murphy, accompanied by Mr. Byington,
went to Judge I^awlor's court. After in
troducing his successor Mr. Murphy said
that it was with pleasure that he in
stalled In compliance of the suggestion
of the District Attorney, William H. Al
ford as prosecutor of the department. He
regret tc-il, however, that circumstances
necessitated the withdrawal of A. P.
Black, wno had proved his ability and de
votion to the cause of justice, but hoped
that Mr. Alford would pruve as able and
loyal to the people as the man whose
place he would henceforth occupy. Judge
Lawlor formally recognised the appoint
ment of Mr. Alford and the new and the
old District Attorneys adjourned to Judge
Cook's court. Here Eugene Deuprey was
installed as Prosecuting Attorney in the
place of General Salomon. The stepping
out of the aged 'and distinguished prose
cutor. General Salomon, and the swear
ing in of his successor were impressive in
the extreme and will not soon be forgot
ten by these who witnessed it.
From Judge Cook's court the inaugu
rating body adjourned to that occupied by
Judge Dunne. H^re J. T. Greaney, who
has occupied the position of prosecutor of
the court under Mr. Murphy, was rein
stalled. The ceremony was of short dura
tion, and at its conclusion District At
torney Byington took up the work of the
office and Judge Murphy was relegated to
private life and private practice.
For Prosecuting Attorneys Charles
Weller was assigned to Judge Con
lan's court; James M. Hanley to
Judge Cabannls' court; R. V. Whit
ing to Jud^e Fritz's and Isaac Har
ris to Judge Mogan's court. His other
appointments are chief warrant and
bond clerk. Charles Peery; assistants â
John J. Greeley, T. I. Fitzpatrick and
William Burke; stenographer, Ix>uis
Ward; office clerk. Wallace Thompson â

office Immediately opposite. Mr. Dodge
succeeded himself without the loast cere
mony and reappointed the deputies, whose
name? have already been published, for a

ify in the civil service.
In addition to the minor positions Mr.
Dodge appointed John F. Glnty as his

EVERYTHING HARMONIOUS
IN THE POLICE COURTS
AFEELIXG of good fellowship and
harmony pervaded tho Police Courts
at noon yesterday when the old
officials retired from the cares and
responsibilities of office and introduced
their successors.
Judge Treadwell introduced his suc
cessor. Judge Cabaniss, in a few well
chosen words. He said he had known him
for years and knew him to be a man of
ability, truthfulness and honesty. "I hope
Â«o one," continued the Judge, "will have
a single word to say against me. I have
erred, but It is human to err, and have
said harsh words and harsh words have
been said against me, but I hope no ani
mosities have been engendered and I wish
you all good-by."
There was applause In court, which
Judge Cabaniss Instantly suppressed, re
marking that he wanted them to under
stand that they were In a court of justice.
He briefly thanked the Judge for what he
had said and presented his commission to
the clerk of the court.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter then
Introduced his successor, James M. Han
ley, and extended his thanks for all the
courtesies accorded to him. Mr. Hanley
made a brief reply.
The clerk of the court Is John A. Fen
ton, who succeeds James P. McQuaide,
one of the most painstaking, efficient and
courteous clerks In any ot the courts.
The bailiffs are Policemen Hall and Flem
ing.
Judge Graham's courtroom was crowded
with Friends of Judge-elect Fritz when the
noon hour arrived. Judge Graham intro
duced him with a few complimentary re
marks and when Judge Fritz arose to re
ply ho was loudly applauded. He thanked
Judge Graham for his kind words and
said he hoped when it came his turn to
leave the bench he would leave behind
him as clean a record as his predecessor.
A floral design was then handed to the
new Judge by his friends.
Prosecuting Attorney Wer.tworth
thanked the court for the courtesies ex
tended him and introduced his successor,
R. V. Whiting. Walter Gallagher, on be
half of the bar, made a speech compli
mentary to the retiring Judge and ex
pressing the good wishes of the bar to
the new Incumbent. John J. Groom re
tains his position as clerk of the Court and
the bailiffs are Sergeant Duncan and Po
liceman Conlon.
Judge Conlan succeeded "himself, but
Prosecuting Attorney Low retired to give
place to Charles L.. Weller, whom he in
troduced In a few well chosen words, at
the same time taking the opportunity to
thank the Judge for courtesies received.
John Rice retains his position as clerk of
the court and the bailiffs are Policemen
R. J. McGrayan and D. Owens. George
Kelly, the retiring bailiff, has occupied
the position for the past seven years, the
longest time on record, and during that
period he made many warm friends by
his efficiency and courtesy.
Judge Mogan also succeeded himself and
the proceedings were brief. Prosecuting
Attorney Joachimsen Introduced I. Har
ris, hlB successor, in a brief complimen
tary speech, and the Judge referred to
Joachlmsen's long years of faithful ser
vice as Judge. Fred Conway retains his
position as clerk and the bailiffs are Po
licemen Coughlln and Love.
The four Judges will probably meet In
bank to-day and draw lots for the long
and short terms.
Charles Peery. chief warrant and bond
clerk, and T. I. Fitzpatrick, John J.
Greeley and William G. Burke, his assist
ants, entered upon their du.les at noon
yesterday. The office will be kept open
day and night. In accordance with the

Asphyxiated by Illuminating Gas and
Left Nothing to Indicate That

Oscar Hard, a bartender by occupation,
was found dead in bed yesterday morning
in his room at 655 Pine street, having been
asphyxiated with illuminating gas.
The deceased had been out of work, for
some time and was destitute, and this
condition led to the belief that the unfor
tunate young man had taken his own life
In a fit of despondency. He was 34 years
of ace, a native 'of Switzerland and a
member of the Swiss Oesang Verein. Mrs.
Ellen Taylor, his landlady, had not seen
him since" last Friday and she did not then
notice anything unusual in his manner or
appearance. No writing was found in the
room that would throw any light on the
question of pulclde or accident.

STRANGEST WAS
THIS OF LIFE'S
SAD HISTORIES
Jekyll and Hyde Were
in Meyers.
PRAYED WHILE WIFE STARVED
â¢
EXHOBTED AND BOBBED HIS
BENEFACTBESS.
When T7nder Arrest He Said He Had
Ever Dreaded the Insane
Asylum to Which He
Was Sent.
In the annals of the courts of San Fran
cisco there has probably never been a case
more worthy of the attention of the stu
dent of mental phenomena than was that
of Dr. I. L. Meyers, who was yesterday
committed to Agnews as insane. A short,
thin man, with a face withered as if by
mental decay rather than age, Meyers
came near realizing mentally the weird
Imagination of the Immortal Stevenson of
Jekyll and Hyde. A graduate of Heidel
berg, he speaks in elegant language.
Often, with tears streaming down his
face, he has held up ideal morality and
exhorted his hearers to lead a life of. un
selfishness.
Before him yesterday stood his half
starved wife and impoverished child, a
little girl barely 7 years old. On the face
of the wife were pity, dread and grief for
the wreck of one whose love was her only
possession except her little girl. She was
poorly clad; her thin shoes barely kept her
feet from the ground. However, she still
found no word of reproach for her hus
band, only pity and love.
Yet the Heidelberg graduate, the accom
plished physician, the spiritual exhorter,
the husband and father had failed to feed
his family, although he had in fifteen days
drawn from banks $600, which he had
taken from two trusting women who fol
lowed him here from the Eastâ all the
money they had in the worldâ and had
left them penniless. He had made a prac
tice for years of uttering bogus checks,
when he had no money in the bank; he
had for years been robbing those who be
friended him. At last he was arrested.
He cast a pitiful glance at his attorney,
Henry P. Dimond, and said:
"And has it come to this at lastâ that I
must go to the insane asylum? All my
life I have dreaded this, and now the
blow Is about to fall."
A few nights ago Mrs. Meyer was
awakened by her husband, who was
bending over her and who had his hand
upon her throat. "It is better that you
and my little girl should die now," said
the husband, whose manner had always
been kind before. The wife made no
complaint. When Meyer was arrested he
had about him enough poison to have
killed a regiment. He nad a bottle of
cyanide of potassium in a pocket, a
package of arsenic in his stocking,
enough strychnine in another place to
have killed a host; other poisons lined his
clothes. For what purpose they were in
tended can only be guessed. There is a
mystery attending his recent life. During
the period when he was drawing large
sums from the bank he had no money for
his family. His wife said, with quiver
ing lip, "I did not want to trouble â¢my
poor husband when he was bo troubled
for money."
Checks as high as $150 and several
others nearly as large have come to
light, and all worthless and known to ba
worthless when they were given. "When
Meyer was asked why he did these things
he said: "As well ask the sun why it
rises; it was foreordained."
He confessed that he had forged deeds
and mortgages. All the time he was
holding religious meetings in his house.
He always hired a fine house and fur
nished it with belongings that were
owned by the two women who followed
him and who believed that he would in
vest their money profitably. He paid no
rent and was always on the move.
The offenses that led him into the
hands of the police were that he pledged
a hired horse and buggy to a pawnbroker;
that he got $50 on the horse and buggy
from John H. Leary of 503 Sutter street:
then he sold the same to J. W. Morsheaa
for $:*). He was arrested for crime and
for insanity, the officers reaching his
house at 632 Haight street at the same
time. Last night he slept at Agnews,
and three women, without one dollar In
the world and with no home, wondered
how they and the little girl who cried
herself to sleep for the loss of "papa"
were to exist.

BUBONIC PLAGUE SPREADING
IN HONOLULU AND MANILA
Houses Burned and Other Radical Steps
Taken to Stamp Out the Dreaded
Scourge.
HONOLULU. Jan. Lâ Seven additional
cases of plague have developed since last
advices, making thirteen cases all told
to date. Three cases were discovered on
the night of the 2Stb uIL. and four cases
have been reported during: the past forty
eight hours.
The Board of Health has decided to take
radical steps to stamp out the scourge.
A portion of the Infected district was
condemned and burned to the ground yes
terday. Three buildings and a large
warehouse were destroyed by fire. The
future policy of the health authorities
will be to destroy all infected buildings.
The presence of the plague in this city
Is commencing to worry the sugar men.
They have the idea that Hawaiian sugar
may be refused at United States ports
If shipped from Honolulu. To get around
this difficulty, the new crop may be
shipped from ports outside of Honolulu.
Kauai sugar can be shipped from Wai
mea. Maul sugar from Kahului and La
haina and Hawaii sugar from Hllo and
Mahukona. Honolulu being the one in
fected port. It is believed that the Fed
eral authorities will agree to this plan
and allow the marketing of the 1599 crop.
The transport Grant arrived off the har
bor early on the morning of the 28th, and
went away, after lying at anchor for an
hour. She took with her four days' news
paper files and a large quantity of mag
azines for two local news companies, the
captain refusing to wait till they were
Bent for. He had no coal to spare and
could not afford to burn it while he lay
at anchor.
The Grant has on board the Forty
eighth Infantry, which was bo long '.n
quarantine In San Francisco on account
of smallpox. ThÂ« men had only Just got
out of Quarantine, In fact, when they
went on board the Grant, only to meet
another quarantine here. Colonel Duvall,
who Is in command, did not want any
more experience of the kind.
WASHINGTON, Jan. B.â The plague has
broken out in Manila beyond a doubt, as
appears from the following cablegram, re
ceived by Surgeon General Sternberg:
"MANILA, Jan. 6.â Three bubonic na
tives. GREENLEAF."
The signer 1b Colonel Greenleaf, assist
ant surgeon general and chief surgeon in
thÂ« Philippines.
The first effect will probably to have a
quarantine laid upon the most rigid sani
tary regulations and this work wili be
undertaken by Colonel Greenleaf pending
the arrival at Manila of the marine hos
pital service officers now on the way.
General Sternberg says that Colonel
Greenleaf is exceptionally well fitted to
cope with the present emergency and he
has no doubt that the disease will soon
be stamped out. It is noted that the cases
of plague reported are confined to the na
tive class and tt Is said that It has been
the case in most of the cities of Asia
where the disease has appeared. It Is no
tably true of Hongkong, where it has ex
isted for many months without caus
ing considerable fatality among the
European population. It was probably
from Hongkong that the disease found its
way to Manila. The medical officers all
along have been on the watch to prevent
this, but owing to the closeness of Hong
kong to Manila and the large amount of
traffic carried on by native junks and
ecows the ultimate Introduction of the
disease into Manila was inevitable.
MANILA. Jan. B.â The bubonic plague
is yet sporadic. There have been six cases
and four deaths. Preparations are being
made to establish hospitals and quaran
tine. Great numbers of provincial natives
are coming to Manila, with whom the city
Is overcrowded, the increase In accommo
dations being Inadequate. The rice neces>-
Bary for foodstuffs is more expensive than
at any period during the last twelve years.
The plague is dangerous to the over
crowded, unfed and unwashed natives and
Chinese. Americans avoiding direct con
tact with the disease are safe.
A force of Filipinos charged twelve men
of the Third Cavalry, who were scouting
behind San Fernando de Laubon. One
trooper and three horses and carbines
were captured. The enemy fled. '

The case of H. J. Hannan, wanted for

George H. Mayer, son of a tailor at 40
MontKomery street, who was arrested last

LAST night was the first opportunity
society has had since Melba be
came a memory to show itself in
all its plumes and plumpness, and
It filled the California Theater
snugly to welcome Emma Nevada with
much applause and many flowers. There
would be perhaps a more sincere compli
ment In more of the former and fewer of
the latter, but the polite enthusiasm was
sufficient to produce an encore for each
number, than which no more could be
asked. No, certainly no more.
Putting aside the favorable prejudice
that the audience had for Mme. Nevada
by reason of her antecedents, her singing
would undoubtedly have won her hearers
and given pleasure to even those most
difficult to please. Yet analyzed her voice
and method are variously deficient. Her
gifts are not great, nor does she use them
greatly, but within her limitations she
sings with charm and makes the very ut
most of the powers that she possesses.
She does not accomplish this, however,
with the virtue of taste, but rather by a
skill that at times approaches trickery.
Her mezza voce is pure, and she has the
faculty of producing tones that sound
iikf> the echo of a bell, but when she
drags the Ume in order to display this
quality one is forced if not to tolerate
either to forgive or condemn.
Mme. Nevada was at her pest In her
second number, "Travoushka, by Tschal
kowskv, and "La Fee aux Chansons, by
liemberp, both excellent songs. The for
mer was particularly interesting In Its
modernity and finely rendered. She again
gave pleasure in the "bhadow Dance,
from *Dinorah," though hardly adequate
in point of dramatic feeling. Her ren
dering, however, showed Bphool and was
well "ounded. The composition Itself has
c perennial Interest, which cannot be said
of the Bell Song, from "Lakme, which
was her first essay.
The encores were of Uttle Importance
either In themselves or In her singing of
them. They consisted of an English and
a German ballad, "Home, Sweet Home,"
and finally "The Mocking Bird." I sus
pect strongly that Mme. Nevada sang
"The Mocking Bird" when she was grad
uated at Mills College, for it seems to be
a favorite of hers, and I can divine no
other reason why It should be thus fea
tured by the diva as it was at her con
cert In the Alcazar fifteen years ago and
again last night. , _ ? _,
The pianist of the evening, Selden Platt.
Is limited in every direction, though par
ticularly I think by his youth. Mr. Blu
menberg, the 'cellist, however. Is a most
capable artist. He played some very in
teresting numbers with a remarkably
masterful style
Orpheum.
The Orpheum management presents
this week some attractions that prove
that there Is yet plenty of first-class ma
terial for first-class vaudeville, the kind
that the Orpheum has educated the peo
ple to demand. Among the new comers
John and Nellie McCarthy begin the pro
gramme In their entertaining sketch,
"The Wall Street Broker," which
abounds in clever dialogue and comic
duets. A new star In the field of dialect
appears In Charles A. Gardiner, whose
specialty is Tyrolean and Canadian
French. The latter Is a novelty and im
mediately "caught on," the recitation of
the hurricane on tho lake being an ar
tistic bit of work. Quaint are the Elinor
Sisters In George M. Cohan's sketch,
"Dangerous Mrs. Delaney." It Is refresh
ingly original, and so are the sisters.
The musical success of the evening is
Frank Latona, "the musical tramp.' His
performance on the one-stringed violin
of "The Miserere" from "Trovatore" and
the Intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rustl
cana" were, loudly encored, and the same
mark of appreciation was shown his
playing of "The Holy City" on the slide
trombone. Among the favorites of last
week are that charming singer and come
dienne, Dorothy Drew, Fougere. Thome
and Carleton in their funny skit, "The
Intruder," Billy Rice, the monologist, and
the eccentric Rozinos.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar was crowded last night,
when Madeline Lucette Ryley's farce
comedy, "The Mysterious Mr. Bugle," was
presented. It Is a clever sketch, full of
smart dialogue and humorous situations
The plot hinges upon the secret engage
ment of Betty Fondacre and Tom Pollln
ger to save Tom from being disinherited
by his grandmother for marrying till ha
reached the years of discretion. Tom gets
her to assume the name of Mrs. Bugle,
and as ho is Insanely jealous he Is con
stantly getting himself and others Into
trouble. It of course ends In satisfactory
explanations all round.
Miss Irene Everett assumed the part or
Betty and created a most favorable Im
pression. She is a native of this city and
has been playing successful engagements
with Frohman'a companies in the East.
She was last here with 'â¢The Girl I Left
Behind Me" company. She has a hand
some stage presence and played her part
intelligently and cleverly. At the close of
the first act she was called before the
curtain and was the recipient of numerous
bouquets. Ernest Hastings as Tom Pol
linger, the Jealous lover, was in his ele
ment and was warmly applauded. Frank
Denlthorne as Allan Fondacre, a Journal
ist, and George P. Webster as Samuel
Tote, a stockbroker, were good. Frank
Opperman made a hit as Chickwell, a re
spectable valet, and Forrest Seabury was
equally successful as Bonaparte, a short
sighted boy. Miss Laura Crews as Julia
Fondacre gave another instance of her
versatility, and Miss Maria Howe as Mrs.
Louisa Tote was excellent.
Grand Opera-House.
"Stnbad," with its catchy music. Jing
ling rhymes and merry wit. continues to
charm good audiences at the Grand
Opera-house. Repetition has lessened
neither the enthusiasm of the players nor
the audience, and the operetta still goes
with all the snap and vigor of the Initial
production.
Columbia.
Hall Calne'B masterpiece, "The Chris
tian," began its last week at the Columbia
last night. There was a splendid audience,
which thoroughly appreciated tha many
good points of the play.
TivolL
"I/lttle 80-Peep" Is â¢ enjoying a thinJ
week at the Tivoll Opera-house, and tha
Interest in that holiday extravaganza has
not diminished, Judging by the large audl
ence which crowded the theater last
evening. Ferris Hartman has a number
of new songs and Jokes, which are sure
to attract attention. The singing, dancers
and marches are up to the usual excellent
standard of that popular playhouse.
Alhambra.
"An Affair of Honor." which is being
produced by the Rentz-Santley Company
at the Alhambra, Is drawing well. A
number of clever specialties are presented
that arouse the laughter and applause of
the audience. The duel scene which Is
shown at the conclusion of the perform
ance is realistic.
Olympla.
The Olympla bill this week Is good.
Zoyarra, the globe artist, mada quite a
hit last night. La Mont and his sister
were well received. Cad Wilson continues
in her popularity, and all the other per
formers made favorable impressions.
Chutes.
Major Mite proved his versatility at the
Chutes theater last night by appearing as
an Irishman, carrying about a pair of
Galway whiskers and singing a song
about "I'm Done With Carrying the Mor
tar." He received no bricks In exchange,
but a number of encores. The Columbian
Four made their first appearance in San
Francisco and scored a hit. Harry De
Lain, the high barytone, appeared as a
French chanteuse. Claude Thardo told a
lot of new stories and sang several new
songs,' and the rest of the bill was excel
lent.

WINS HER SUIT
AGAINST AGED
JOSEPH BOARDMAN
Mrs. Gladstone Ob
tains Judgment.
THE VERDICT FOR $25,000
END OP A CASE WHICH EXCITED
INTEREST IN TWO CITIES.
Elizabeth Gladstone has been awarded
Judgment against aged Joseph Boardman,
the Oakland millionaire, for $23,000 for
breach of promise. The Jury Impaneled
to try the case reached this verdict late
last evening. The announcement came as
a shock for the defendant and a surprise
for the spectators, while the stout and
matronly plaintiff was consumed with joy.
Immediately after the filing of the ver
dict A. R. Cotton, who represented Board
man, moved for a stay of execution, which
the court granted. A motion for a new
trial will soon be made, and in event of
its denial an appeal will be taken to the
Supreme Court.
Mrs. Gladstone's suit, which was
prompted by the defendant's action in
marrying a "girl of IS years, has attracted
considerable attention. It was alleged by
Mrs Gladstone that Mr. Boardman's first
wife* suggested, when she was on her
deathbed, that she (Mrs. Gladstone) mar
ry Mr. Boardman as soon as possible.
After Mrs. Boardman's death, Mrs. Glad
stone further averred, Boardman con
stantly begged her hand in marriage, and
finally, after Mrs. Boardman had been In
the grave for about six months, she con
sented. Subsequently Boardman met his
present wife, and the ceremony that bound
them established a cause of action for
Mrs. Gladstone. t ... Â»,.
The case has been on trial during tn*
past week before Judge Hunt. Witnesses
by the score were called, and the testi
mony closed when the white-haired de
fendant left the stand yesterday morning.
William Boardman, the defendant, ap
peared as the last witness in the case. The
old man. who recently took unto himself
a bride of 18 years, faltered on the way
to the stand, but finally reached It and
said that he did not know whether or not
he had said that Mrs. Gladstone proposed
marriage to him on the day she alleges
he proposed to her. Boardman was on
the stand but a short time, and when he
retired the plaintiffs attorneys made their
argument to the Jury. The defense fol
lowed. Judge Hunt gave his Instructions
and the Jury retired to deliberate or. a
verdict. The Jury deliberated several
hours before the verdict was reached, but
TANFORAN MANAGERS
ASKED TO APOLOGIZE
Corrigan's Assault on Milroy
May Cause a Racing War.
The California Jockey Club Calls the At
tention of the Western Turf Asso
ciation to the Matter.
ED CORRIGAN will be called to ac
count for the flood of abuse he
poured out last Saturday at Tan
foran Park against Secretary' it-
B. Milrcy of the Oakland track.
The California Jockey Club feels Itself
Insurted In the person of its secretary, and
does not propose to let the matter drop
as Quietly as the ex-master of Hawthorn*
would wleh.
All yesterday morning at the offices of
the California Jockey Club the attaches
confidently awaited the arrival of a note
containing the Information that the West
ern Turf Association had taken official
cognizance of the assault, apologizing for
It and promising an investigation. It Jid
rot come. During the afternoon it became
apparent that it had not been mailed. It
was decided by President Thomas H. Will
iams Jr. that the Western Turf Associa
tion needed a gentle reminder of its over
sight, and he sat down at once to dictate a
letter to Secretary K. H. Green of the
derelict association. It was mailed at
once.
In the letter Mi!roy*s assailant 1s re
ferred to as "Mr. Ed Corrigan. a horse
xnan racing on your track." Coupled with
the well-known fact that the ex-mat-ter f-f
Hawthorne is the real master at Tan
foran. this reference might be taken as a
bit of ?arcaem. Intended to slrik deeper
into the souls of the Western Turf Acso
ciation officials the feeling of slnfu'.nesa
for their omission.
The fact of the blasphemous assault on
Mllroy by Corrigan 1b pet forth, together
with the narace of those who witnessed
it, and the Tanforan people are reminded
that their rules provide penalties for the
use of vile language.
In conclusion the Western Turf Associa
tion was reminded in the letter that the
California Jockey Club was disappointed
in not having received the expected note
of ajK>logy for the occurrence. A prompt
reply was aeked. A copy of the letter to
Secretary Green was inclosed In an en
velope addressed to President Henry J.
Crocker.
This action of the California Jockey
Club paFFes the buck directly to the nom
inal managers of Tanforan track. It
leaves two courses open, either an apology
or 6ller.ee. An apology will hardly come,
for the reason that Corrigan was never
known to be manful enough to apologize
for anything, and â Corrigan Is practically
the whole Western Turf Association,
Henry 3. Crocker and others appearing to
the contrary. Even If Messrs. Crocker and
Green Insisted. Corrigan would hardly
consent, knowing as he does that it would
open the way to punish him for the In
fraction of rule 6 he put up for the benefit
of other fellows.
On the other hand, silence will be costly.
Refusal on the part of the Western Turf
Association to apologize for the bad con
duct of Corrigan and to investigate his
violation of his own rules will undoubt
edly result In a breaking off of the none
too friendly relations existing between the
two tracks. In that event the finish of
Corrigan and Tanforan can be seen with
out consulting the "dope" book.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1900.
TWENTY POLICEMEN ADDED
TO CHINATOWN DETAIL
Acting Chief of Police Biggy
Will Stop the Heathen War.
Highbinders Continue to Arrive and
the Most Serious Trouble Is Yet
to Come.
f\ CTTNG Chief of Police Biggy visited Chinatown last night
Â¦t~\. and after hearing the facts of the treacherous highbinder war
which has been in progress for the past month ordered twenty ex
tra policemen on the Chinatown detail to assist Sergeant Duke in
preventing, as far as possible, any more bloodshed. At present
there are six men detailed in the Chinese section of the city. The
additional twenty will commence duty this morning.
THE situation is beginning to look
very grave in Chinatown. Hop Sing
Tong men are flocking to this city
and nearly 100 of them arrived
within the last few days. When
their forces are sufficiently strong
to attack the Suey Sings the of
ficers predict an era of bloodshed
which will eclipse anything known in the
history of Chinese affairs in San Fran
cisco. Already four of their members
have fallen victims of their rivals' bullets,
while they have picked off but one man
of the Suey Sing Tong. According to the
code of tong procedure matters must be
evened up and only by the taking of life.
Since the beginning of the present dif
ficulty the Hop Sing Tong has experi
enced a decided disadvantage, due to the
absence of about one-half of its forces
from this city. Another event which
served to handicap the tong was the ar
rest and conviction of its secretary and
another leading murderer for carrying
concealed weapons. There are nearly 1300
Suey Sings in Chinatown, while the Hop
Sings muster but GOO. The reason for the
presence of so many Suey Sings la because
many of them are fishermen, who are em
ployed in the northern canneries during
the summer and who spend the winter in
San Francisco. The Hop Sings have been
afraid to strike a decisive blow against
their antagonists owing to this condition
of affairs. Consequently the war until
the present time has been one-sided and
the men of the weaker side have been
picked off as fast as the Suey Sing men
could find opportunity to commit murder.
A few days ago the Hop Sing Tong be
gan calling its men in from the country
towns, and when the line-up is equal on
both sides a merry war will begin. Act
ing Chief of Police Biggy visited China
town last night and Inquired into the con-
ditlon of affairs. He recognized the dan
ger and will use every precaution to pre
vent any further bloodshed. He informed
Sergeant Duke of his intention to Increase
his squad before he left Chinatown.
Fan Chat, who was shot early yesterday
morning in Washington alley, was a mem
ber of the Hop Sing Tong. He is still at
the Receiving Hospital and may recover.
The men who did the shooting are in the
tanks. Fan Chac formerly belonged to the
Suey Sings, at whose hands he nearly met
his death, but withdiew and joined tho
other tonp about two years ago. It is be
lieved that his switching from one order
to another actuated in part the plot
against his life.
A rumor was afloat that. Chat was shot
at because he gave information in the
murder case of the preceding night, but
the police arc disinclined to accept this
as truth. The two men arrested for his
murder at first claimed that they wens
occupants of the house in which they
were captured, but this has been proven
untrue. Chat positively refuses to Identify
the men or to assist in their conviction.
Last night a band of armed highbinders
lay in wait for a Chinaman in Spofiord
alley. Officers Herring, Davids and Con
ner were notified and charged upon the
place, but the wily hired murderers had.
received a tip that they were coming and
had made good their escape. Every Chlni
man is being searched, but few carry their
weapons around with them on the streets
The members of the respective tongs are
banded together in such a way that a
highbinder has but to step into any house
friendly to his tong and claim the use of
their weapons when he desires them. It
Is said by the police that there were fewer
Chinamen on the streets last night than
on any nlpht since the war began.
It is understood that at midnight the
highbinders effected a settlement by
which they will discontinue hostilities for
a few days, or until after their holidays.
