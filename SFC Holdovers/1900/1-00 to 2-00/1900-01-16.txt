upon himself the Ignominy of bargaining
with blackguards to prostitute one of the
great Institutions of the city. Why will
such a man stultify himself, give the lie
to the, best of his assertions, bring into
contempt the promises he has made and
surround himself and his policy with de
served odium? - : '
. Why will he, on the very eve of what
the people of this- city believe to be an
era of decency and purity' in local gov
ernment, of honest and. able men In'office,
commit a social crime;' that, has no par
allel even In the reign of the Buckleys, the

satisfied and that Is why he occupies tha
astounding position to-day of bartering
away to those that feed on crime the Po
lice Department of this city. He wants
another influence now, and the Police De
partment Is the price of that Influence.
He repudiates tho right or the arrogance
of a newspaper to think for him or to die-
Police and a thief with a record for Chief
of Detectives. No petty gain could Induce
him to associate cheek by jowl with the
blacklegs, gamblers, riff-raff and scum of
the city.
But what a bribe of money could not do
a bribe of power has done. Â¦ He has finish

no' longer needs the wheedling art to win
towers to show him as he Is, to lift the
mask of the reformer and show the
greedy face of the politician beneath.
Mayor Phelan accepts with poor grace. the
expose of his dishonest plot and the ques
tion Is asked why a man of great wealth,
occupying a position of respect among his
fellows, with every opportunity to earn
and to hold their esteem, should place
OUT OF THE CALDRON OF THE MAYOR'S AMBITION COME APPARITIONS TO
AFFRIGHT THE CITY.
tate his policy, but for thÂ© sake of a
newspaper's influence to lift him into tha
United States Senate he Is selling tha
Police Department to the thieves of this
city. This la the motive of his shameful
conduct and the secret of the bond which
has startled the city. And at least ona
newspaper will assure Mr. Phelan that it
has no desire to undertake the serious
task of doing his thinking: for him; If it
can restrain his actions within the bounds
of common decency It will rest content.
So craftily have the schemers worked
In {heir plot to make this city a netwonc
of criminal manipulation and bribery that
even the members of the Police Commis
sion do not know how they were appoint
ed. The Call will tell one of them the
secret, although the revelation will cover
him in humiliation. William J. Biggy be
lieves that he hold 3 the very honorable
position of being the personal representa
tive of Mayor Phelan on the commission.
Mayor Phelan has told him so. and In tell
ing him told what was not true. Wlillam
J. Biggy is a makeshift on the Police
Commission. He was literally a "last
chance" in the desperate game to maka
Frederick L. Esola, alias Frederick Har
rington, Chief of Police. Biggy waa
chosen simply because he was thought to
be sold to the supporters of Esola.
William J. Biggy may not know this,
but it is true, and he need not tax his
memory greatly to remember that the
first ictimatlon he had of a commisslon
ership was when he received the Informa
tion from one of Esola's champions. The
backers of the man with the alias can
vassed available men with the utmost
care. They knew the seriousness of their
task. It is not an easy problem to find
reputable men, who value their reputa
tions, that are willing to elevate to such
a post as Chief of Police one who has
neither education, experience nor execu
tive ability. It is not easy to secure men
who are willing to place their reputations,
their honor and their future In this com
munity In a balance with a thief.
So the sckemers that were plotting foi
Esola, that through him and his adminis
tration they might prey upon this city,
canvassed the names of decent men care
fully. One by one the candidates slipped
through the sieve. Men seldom sell theix
fionor willingly. And at last William J.
Biggy remained. The schemers went to
Mayor Phelan and commanded him to
place Biggy on the Police Commission.
The Mayor had flattered Blggy as he had
flattered many others; profuse In prom
ises, his Honor was lamentably poor in
performance. He promised to place Bigg?
on the Board of Public Works and intend
ed to give him nothing.
But then came thl3 new command. Tha
Mayor had struck a bargain with Shylock*
and he had to give his pound of flesh.
"With that cunning born In the pool ol
politics he made a virtue of necessity. 1 1Â«
sent for William J. Biggy and told hire
that he was to become a Police Commis
sioner. "And I want you, Mr. Blgsy."
said the Mayor, "to be my personal repre*
sentatlve upon the board."
And will Mr. Biggy accept the distinc
tion? "Will he tolerate the position of be.
Ing Mayor Phelan's chattel who has bees
bought and sold and is the price of a
corrupt political bargain? Mr. Biggy re
sisted an attempt once to buy him whei
be was a State Senator. Is he any cheapei
now, or does he claim the same manhood
he fought for then?
These are the conditions under whicfi
the people of this city are fighting to pre*
vent a great institution from being pros
tituted to dangerous uses. The Pol let
Commission met yesterday afternoon an<
decided to investigate the charges agalns
Esola on Thursday night. They presente<
the spectacle of four honorable men try
ing to determine if there is a chance foi
them to elect as Chief cf Police a mat
without experience or educational quail
fication. with no recommendation except
an alias and a fellowship with gamblera
blacklegs and creatures of the tenderloin
The picture was not a plejwant one foi
new San Francisco,
ffi^Â» HE Etcrrn which has burst about I
i the head of the recreant Mayor
rt^ as the result of his political bar-
a *' gain to sell the Police Depart
ment to the criminal elements of
the city has overshadowed every other
local issue in public discussion. The
enormity of the outrage is just beginning
to be felt by men who can see the far
tvaciiinft and <3Â»Â»Â«dJy confluences of -the
dea.l. A protest Is being voiced on every
ei<Je and people cannot suppress their in
dignation at the shameless effrontery of
the Mayor and his allied schemers. Never
In the darkest days of its political history
has the city faced as serious a crisis.
There have been times without number
In the history of San Francisco when pub
â¢ lie abuses have provoked campaigns for
reform. Judges have been debauched and
courts corrupted. The local legislature
has reeled with the odors of official cor
ruption. Juries have been dishonest and
departments upon departments have been
in the shadow of suspicion. The city has
been overrun by the lawless. Crime, dis
order, distress and death have come as
the ccr.sec,ue-!ce cf the ascendency of one
set of politicians or another.
Bur Thtre has always been a hope and
an effort for reform. Dishonest officials
have been whipped into oblivion and the
administration of the city has been
placed in new hands. So the course of
the city has run. If it suffered the evil
of maladministration It knew that the
whole system was not corrupt. If the
principles of social morality were violated
the remedy was in the near future. If
dishonest officers were bribed to sell the
rights and safeguards of the people there
was the assurance that the betrayal
would only be temporary.
But now. the entire prospect has
changed. There is In supreme authority
a man who assumes to hold the reins of
the whole government in his hands, to do
as his whim or caprice may suggest. And
this man has beÂ«n convicted of the of
fense Of paddling his way through the
mire of politics and dragging forth from
its depth creatures for positions of trust
and honor. Soiled as his hands are, he
dare not exhibit them to the public, but
chooses four men of reputation and un
eullied character to enter the disgusting
pool and lift the Mayor's creatures, who
have become his masters, to their posts
of unmerited dignity and responsibility.
Does William Thomas relish the task?
Does he accept willingly the obligation
to soil his reputation and smear his hands
by lifting a man stamped by an alias and
welcomed only in the good fellowship of
the tenderloin to the chair of Chief of
Police? Does William Thomas, whose
pride has been his freedom of decent ac
tion, indorse the politician's plot that
would make a thief, a defaulter and a
fugitive the first chief of detectives of
new San Francisco?
Does William J. Biggy take kindly to
that dictation which forces him to make
a blackleg his official representative?
Has Mr. Biggy changed his code of ethics
Flnce the time he felt It his duty to de
nounce corruption in public affairs? Is he
now bound to pTace in authority over de
cent men a man who Is ashamed of his
own name or afraid of it? And does Mr.
Biggy believe that, eince the Mayor arro
gates the right to do his thinking for him,
the Mayor can patch tattered reputa
tions?
Do Dr. McN'utt and George A. Xewhall
wish their associates and the public to
believe that they are servile creatures of
the jr.an who gave them office? Do they
wish the public to understand that their
lust for position weighs more In the bal
ance than their honor? Are they content
to brand their administration with aliases
on the roll of tsfficers as well as in the
rogues' gallery?
Mayor Phelan declares that the news
papers are attempting to do his thinking
for him. If they could correct his methods
the service would be well worth the at
tempt, but they have- come from their
THE SHAMELESS CONSPIRACY TO TRANSFORM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF THIS CITY INTO A GIGANTIC NEST OF THIEVES BY ELECTING FREDERICK L. ESOLA, ALIAS FREDERICK HARRINGTON,
CHIEF OF POLICE, AND JULES J. CALLUNDAN, ALIAS WORTHINGTON, CHIEF OF DETECTIVES, HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH TO CALL A HALT. THE RAID OF THE BLACKLEGS HAS WORKED TOO SERIOUS
AN EVIL, AND THIS MORNING THE CALL CHARGES MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN WITH THE COMMISSION OF A FELONY. HE HAS DISHONORED HIMSELF, BETRAYED THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED HIM
AND HAS BROUGHT DOWN UPON THE CITY THE CONTEMPT OF DECENT MEN. THE CALL CHARGES HIM WITH HAVING ENTERED INTO AN ANTE - ELECTION CONTRACT TO DELIVER CONTROL OF
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO A. M. LAWRENCE. IN DOING THIS MAYOR PHELAN COMMITTED A FELONY AND IS LIABLE UNDER THE LAW TO THE FORFEITURE OF THE HIGH OFFICE HE HAS
DISGRACED. THE CALL MAKES THIS CHARGE AND ASKS MAYOR PHELAN TO SUE IT FOR LIBEL THIS PAPER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS UTTERANCES UNDER THE LAW, AND MAYOR PHELAN CAN
NOT EVADE THE ISSUE.
IF HE HAS NOT COMMITTED A FELONY HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS BEEN GROSSLY LIBELED, AND THE CALL AGAIN ASKS HIM TO INSTITUTE SUIT AGAINST IT. IT WILL STIPULATE
FURTHER, AND AGREE TO PERMIT THE ATTORNEYS OF THE MAYOR TO CHOOSE ANY OF THE TWELVE SUPERIOR COURTS IN THIS CITY TO TRY THE CAUSE, AND IT WILL THEN PRODUCE IN
COURT PROOF OF THE CRIME OF WHICH IT ACCUSES HIM. HE DARE NOT ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE, BECAUSE HE IS GUILTY, AND HE DARE NOT EVADE IT IF HE WISHES TO HOLD THE RE
SPECT OF HONEST MEN.
THE CALL WOULD NOT ASK THIS OF HIM WERE IT NOT THAT THE FORTY DAYS, PROVIDED BY THE PURITY OF ELECTION LAW FOR ANY PROTEST AGAINST HIM, HAS EXPIRED. HE
SHOULD, THEREFORE, IF HE HONORS HIS NAME, BRING SUIT TO PRESERVE IT, AND WHEN HE DOES THE CALL WILL PRODUCE IN COURT INDUBITABLE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE
CONTRACT THAT IS HIS SHAME AND THE MENACE OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY. THE CALL WILL PROVE THAT HE CONTRACTED BEFORE ELECTION TO DELIVER THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO A.
M. LAWRENCE, TO INSURE THE ELECTION OF F. L. ESOLA AS CHIEF OF POLICE AND TO BETRAY THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY TO ITS PREDATORY CLASSES.
THERE CAN NO LONGER BE ANY EVASION. THESE CHARGES ARE EITHER AN ASSAULT UPON THE INTEGRITY OF MAYOR PHELAN, AND PLACE HIM BENEATH THE CONTEMPT OF HON
EST MEN, OR THEY ARE THE TRUTH.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 15.â Attorney Gen
eral Grlggs has filed an answer In the Su
preme Court of the District of Columbia
in the proceedings for prize money for
captures at â¢ Manila Bay by Admiral
Dewey. The Attorney General asks that
the cause be referred to a commissioner
and that Admiral Dewey, his officers and
crew and also the United States may have
leave to take testimony. The Attorney
General concedes that a state of war
existed, but denies that the squaflron un
der Dewey's command captured the Span
ish cruisers Isla de Cuba, Isla de Luzon
and Don Juan de Austria. . These ves
sels, he says, were eunk during the en
gagement. He askÃ for fuller Informa

were made, such capture does not author
ize Its condemnation as prize to Dewey

verely condemned. It Is known that there
are diseased cows among some of the

of the city Board of Health and Burns

that an Inspector be appointed with power

and kill the same when found suffering
from tuberculosis. They insisted that tho
health of the people required it. J. C.
Zuck and Attorney Edward Crowford ap
peared for the dairymen of Gllroy. They
said the people they represent would op
pose any such ' inspection, especially
where it was sought to kill their cows,
and would pay no attention to any act
less than a State law. Attorney Crow
ford stated that none of his constituents'
products were sold here,- but all were

CONSIDERING HAWAIIAN
GOVERNMENT MEASURE
Hltt Answers the Main Objections
to the Territorial Form
Proposed.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.â The bill oro
vlding for a form of government for
Hawaii was taken up to-day by the House
Committee on Territories, and Represent
ative Hltt of Illinois, a member of the
Hawaiian Commission, explained its gen
eral purpose and the need of early action.
Hltt said that the present laws cauced
much trouble among the people and tlio
business interests, and as the political des
tiny of Hawaii was no longer an open
question it was much desired to bring all
conflicts of authority to a close and estab
lish a stable system as soon as possible.
He took Â¦up tho three main objections
raised to the Territorial form of govern
ment .proposed and answered them.
The proposed property qualification for
voters for members of the Senate Jarred
somewhat upon our sensibilities and cus
toms, Httt said, but it was in line with
the local sentiment and usage in Hawaii,
and the desire had been to yield to tho
reasonable desires of the people of the
Islands...
The reference of contested election
cases to the courts and the provision giv
ing to the Governor the appointment of
Judges were urged by the people of Ha
waii. Thepeople of the, islands dreaded
any plan which would colonize Hawaii
with office-holders from Washington, and
they therefore wanted their own Governor
to make the appointments.
The committee arranged to take up the
bill by sections at the next meeting
Chairman Knott says he hopes to report
the bjll to the House during the present
month. :â¢ :. V-
no trace has been found of the missing
men, and people here are beginning to
wonder what has become of them.
At 5 o'clock this afternoon a messenger
arrived here with news of the discovery
of four wrecked junks. The Junks are
ashore a few miles below Red Rock, ar.d
are dismantled. Frem what could be
learned there was no trace of any strug
gle.
Constable Hughes, when seen to-night,
stated that he had no knowledge of the
officers' object in disappearing, as no no
tification of their' purpose had been sent
to him. District Attorney Mclsaac is
naturally somewhat surprised at the ac
tion taken by the officers, as the step was
taken without the sanction of the Fish
Commissioners, who ordered Deputy Mil
ler to confer with him before making any
further raids. '
FRAUD ALLEGED
IN RAILWAY DEAL
Property Sold at One-
Tenth Its Value.
SEATTLE, Jan. 15.â A bill in equity on
behalf of New York and Canadian stock
holders of the Seattle, Lake Shore and
Eastern Railway was filed In the United
States Circuit Court to-day against the
Seattle and International Railway, asking
for a receiver for the road, also asking
for an Injunction against the. moving of
the tracks of the company. An examlna- '
tlon into the accounts of the Union Trust
Company of New York is also demanded;
charges of fraud and conspiracy are made
against the Union Trust Company and
the Seattle and International Railway in
the mortgage foreclosure wherein the Se
attle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway
was sold to satisfy the mortgage of the
Union Trust Company.
The bill makes specific charges that a
combination and organization agreement
was entered into by the committee rep
resenting the Union Trust Company and
those who subsequently became the Seat
tle and International Railway to bid in
the property for $1,000,000 when the same
was worth $10,000,000; to make false ac
counts to the court so as to show that
the property was only equal to the value
of the mortgage and that certain stock
holders of the Seattle, Lake Shore and
Eastern Railway, consisting of Armour of
Chicago. Christian and Patton of New
York and others who have become the
principal organizers of the Seattle and In
ternational Railway combined in a scheme
with the Union Trust Company to make
false accounts and a wrong showing to
the court so that all other creditors, could
be frozen out from receiving any benefits
from the property and specifically charg
ing that $143,000 in cash was misappro

HEROIC MEASURES TAKEN
TO STAMP OUT THE PLAGUE
-
Honolulu Officials Continue the Razing of
Chinatown With Fire and Make the
Quarantine More Strict.
HONOLULU. Jan. S.â Sinc<> tho Ist inst.
nine cases of plaeue have developed, mak
ing twenty-two cases to date. The Board
of Health has adopted heroic measures
and it 1? believed that the work now In
progress will stamp out the scourge in a
short space of time.
. Thus fur but one European has been
attacked. The case was that of Ethel
Johnson, a Norwegian girl, aged 14 years.
The other twenty-one cases are divided
as follows: Chinese. 15; Japanese, 2; Ha
waiian, 3; South Sea Islander, 1.
The following resolution was adopted
by the Board of Health:
It 1* the wnse of this m^rtlne that it Is a
s<Mind policy to remove to quarantine as rapidly
as j.racticabl*- the residents of <h? Chinatown
district and to take any and every step with
out limit necessary tr> stamp out the plagup.
Including the destruction of the buildings and
ether iirtferty.
In accordance with the foregoing.
Chinatown is being rapidly burned out.
Within a week a majority of the resi
dents of the plague Fpot will be removed
to new and cleaner quarters on the out
skirts of the city. Thirty-one buildings
are being erected by the Government.
These structures will accommodate about
3000 persons.
On the 3d inst. the Board of Health de
clared the entire judicial district of Hono
lulu under quarantine. All persons are
forbidden to leave the district without
permission of the Board of Health. All
persons outside, of the district are for
lildden to harbor any one coming from
the district without the permission of the
Board of Health. The Board of Health
has established a new sub-department as
a precautionary measure and a further
safeguard to the community. In future,
when suspicious cases are reported, the
suspected premises will be immediately
quarantined. The purpose of this depart
ment iÂ« to prevent the people of a sus
pected house leaving euch premises. In
the past a suspicious case was the signal
for everybody to pack up and leave be
fore the diagnosis had been completed.
This has been so in Chinatown and out
of it.
The Council of State has appropriated
J273.000 with which to fight the plague and
place the city In a proper sanitary condi
tion.
Some of the captains of the Bailing ves
pcls leaving hero for the coast are relax
ing from the strictness of the rule of
taking no passengers from Honolulu, and
there is now some chance for persons to
go away if they are willing to go on sail
ing vessels. The schooner Columbia,
which leaves here next week, is taking
passengers. She goes to Port Townsend.
The Consul gives it as his opinion that
there Is no objection to sailing vessels
carrying travelers from here ,ond the
booking of" passengers has no effect on
th* bills of health Issued.
The Idea of establishing a quarantine
station for passengers -who are going
away on the Australia has been aban
doned, as Mere is no suitable place for
such a quarantine. Those who desire to
take the Australia will have to book ten
days before the date of departure and
will be required to report daily to DrÂ»
Carmichael.
The authorities on the island of Kauai
have taken action that seems to com
pletely cut the island from communi
cation with Honolulu, on account of the
plague. Even mail cannot come from
there while the present rules are enforced
and the island steamship compfinles. will
suffer heavily in loss of business. The
Steamer Ke Au Hou arrived this morning
from the island without having been able
to approach any wharf. There were Dep
uty Sheriffs with shotguns at every land
ing place and they shouted the order to
keep away. The result was that the Ke
Au Hou returned to Honolulu absolutely
empty.
if Kauai continues to carry out the pol
icy it has begun a number of sailing ves
sels now in the harbor here will be held
indefinitely, as they are waiting for car
goes of sugar. Kauai may also have to
pay for it in increased prices of goods, on
account of an advance in freight rates to
pay for running empty steamers one way.
The Mariposa was sighted at about 4:30
yesterday morning. The custom and
Board of Health officers was to meet
her in the pilot boat. It was expected,
that she would stay outside, but as she
had freight for here and needed 250 tons
of coal to carry her to the colonies, it
was decided to anchor her in the harbor.
Letter mail was sent ashore In the pilot
boat and later the passengers and other
mall were landed by the steamer Lehua.
The Mariposa remained in strict quar
antine. No one from Honolulu wrs al
lowed on board except the pilot. Those
who went out to meet her returned on
the pilot boat. None of her officers or
crew were permitted ashore and no vis
itors were allowed on the vessel. She
took no freight or passengers from here.
The Mariposa sailed at midnight.
WOODLAND, Jan. 15.â Miss Florence
Clifford of this .city and Bede Hilliker
of Oakland were married in this city this
afternoon at the residence of Mrs. P. A.

TO CONNECT MOLINEUX
WITH ANOTHER CRIME
Prosecution Seeks to Sho-w a Motive
for the Poisoning of Henry
C. Barnet.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.-In the trial of
Roland B. Molineux for the murder of
Mrs. Katherine J. Adams the prosecution
to-day introduced testimony to show a
motive for the poisoning of Henry C. Bar
net by Molineux. While Molineux is not
on trial for the murder of Barnet It Is ex
ceedingly Important for the prosecution
to connect Molineux with Barnefs death,
as showing Molineux's character, his let
ter-writing habits and his alleged U3>3
of cyanide of mercury to kill those whom
he hated. The testimony to-day reflected,
severely upon the good name of Mrs. Mol
ineux, but her husDand listened unmoved.
The prosecution called Rachel Green
(colored) of Washington, D. C. who- tes
tified that she had at one time lived at
257 West Seventy-fifth street, where a
Mrs. Bell lived. Asked if she knew tha
defendant she replied that she knew Mr.
Chesborough, who lived there with Mrs.
Chesborough. Ask*d If she saw Mr.
Chesborough In the room she walked
through the courtroom in front of the're
corder's desk, stepped up to within threa
feet of the defendant and pointed her tln
ger straight at Molineux, exclalmlns:
"Thafs the man."
The next witness was Minnie Betts, an
other colored woman. She testified that
she had been employed as waitress and
had tended the doors at Mrs. Bellinger' *
West avenue house and that Misa Blancho
Chesborough had lived there, but she went
away In the summer of IS9B. The witness
testified that she never saw Mr. Molineux
until after he was married to Blancha
Chesborough. Asked If any other man
ever came to see her there the witness
replied in the affirmative. To the ques
tion of what he looked like Weeks object
ed and the objection was sustained by tho
court.
Osborne was afterward allowed to show
the witness a picture of H. C. Barnet.
After an inspection of the photograph of
Barnet the witness said that it looked liko
the man who called on Miss Chesborough,
but that she could not remember positive
ly-

SPIRITED DEBATE
ON IMPERIALISM
Pettigrew Arraigns the
Administrat : on.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.â Spirited de
bate on the Philippine question occupied
the attention of the Senate for nearly
three hours to-day. Berry (Dem.) of
Arkansas first addressed the Senate in
support of the resolution recently intro
duced by Bacon (Dem.) of Georgia re
garding the disposition of the Philippines.
He was followed by Pettigrew (Silver Re
publican) of South Dakota in support of
his resolution of inquiry. Pettigrew was
very bitter in his attack upon the admin
istration. . Wolcott (Rep.) of Colorado
replied to Pettigrew, scathingly arraign
ing the South Dakota Senator for the at
titude he had assumed on the Philippine
question. He declared his belief that if
Aguinaldo himself occupied the seat In
the Senate occupied by Pettigrew, repre
senting the people of South Dakota, who
had sent their sons as soldiers to the
Philippines, he would be too patriotic, too
devoted to the interests of the country to
assume the attitude assumed by the
present Sduth Dakota Senator.
During his speech Pettigrew said those
who 'denied freedom to oihvrs could not
long retain it themselves. Such a policy
would be the destruction of the republic.
He entered upon a sharp attack upon the
treaty made by the Americans with the
Sultan of Sulu, charging that polygamy
and slavery were not only indorsed but
maintained by the United States through
the treaty with the Sultan. He declared
that the Republican party was going out
of power as the champion of slavery and
a repudlator of the Declaration of Inde
pendence. Egypt, said Pettigrew. had
been brought under England s civilizing
sway. As a result over 350') minions ot
the English Government were wringing
taxes from the oppressed people of fcgypt
in the name of civilization. Ireland-
Catholic Irelandâ aiso waa bow<d down
under the English yoke. If we desired
to make war on Catholics, however, we
could lind them nearer home.
Aside from all these considerations, Pet,
tigrew argued that the Americans coulu
not dominate the Philippines. The race
could not live In the tropics any more than
a polar bear. Kipling's poem, Tne
White Man's Burden," lie characterized
as contemptible. ,
Turning to the commercial side of the
question, he asked how we wÂ»tc to. get
rich supporting a big ..standing army In
the Philippines in order that people who
earn 5 cents a day might trade with us.
In China he had .seen 3500. China-,
men working In a cotton mill for
wages that â¢ averaged $3 50 a month
in silver and boarding them
selves. Yet our workingmen were to be
asked to compete with t>.000,000 of such
workers in the Philippines, to- pay taxes
to support an army of occupation, to sub
sidize ships to' carry, trade in order' that
the trusts of this country might exploit
the labor of the Philippines. Pettigrew
said that if his programme could be car
ried out, it would be: First, to withdraw
our troops; second, to allow the Philip
pines to set up an Independent govern
ment, and third, he would say: "Hands
off, this is neutral territory."
At the conclusion of the" Philippine dis
cussion Rawlins (Dem.) of Utah address
ed an elabprate nrgumtnt to the Senate
in opposition to the proposed financial leg
islation.

* JOHN E. SULLIVAN, Sacramento's few Chief of Police. I
SaCRAMENTO, Jan. 15.â The appointment of John E. Sullivan as Chief of
Police sent In last week by Mayor Clark, was confirmed by the Board of
Trustees to-nipht and Sullivan will receive his star as the head of thÂ«
police department. The selection 13 regarded as an excellent
"one, and It is generally believed that Chief Sullivan will make a splendid
record in office. He is temperate in habits and courteous in manner, while he
has ability of a character which should permit him to master the trying require
ments of the position.
Chief Sullivan was born at Providence. R. T., in IS<Â«. He has been a resi
dent of Sacramento for twenty-three years, during twenty-two of which he
served as an employe of the Southern Pacific. For sixteen y?ars he was con
nected with the Sacramento paid fire department and was for twelve years fore
man of Engine Company No. 1. He resigned from the department and from the
employ of the railroad company in 1838 to take a position as deputy In the
ofllce of County Assessor Berkey. ...
The appointment is declared by his friends not to have been dictated by
party Interests, but solely by consideration of the personal friendship existing
between Mayor Clark and Sullivan and because of the Mayor's recognition of
his ability. .; v

SCENES AT THE
tion. held here a month ago, be heard.
C. D. Blaney seconded the motion.
S. P. Sanders, the chairman "of the com
mittee on organization, stated its report
was not an elaborate one. It recommend
ed that an organization be effected under
the co-operative law of IS'Jo. After or
ganization the form of contract to be en
tered into and by-laws must be adopted.
He said the name of "The California u'rnlt
Growers' Association" had been decided
upon. There would not be any capitali
zation. An Important thing is member
ship, and as soon as the voting members
are known the body should proceed to the
election of directors. The form of con
tract has been carefully prepared, along
the lines of that of the Raisin Growers'
Cards were then circulated for signa
tures of membership. They read: "I
hereby agree to join the California Fruit
Growers' Association and agree to pay the
membership fee of $5." : . '
Considerable questioning followed. Noah
S. Kogertj asked if tne signature of
a person to the card meant he would sign
the contract of the association and let
the organization handle his fruit. E. W.
Dunne and J. J. Shaner joined in the dis
cussion.
Chairman Bond said he thought a grow
er's signature to the card was equivalent
to membership in the association.
W. H. Lawrence thought the admission
fee of $5 was too high and suggested that
it be made $2.
Judge Bond said $3 would hardly be
sufficient to raise enaugh to conduct a
canvass of the State and he thought it
should be left as it stood.
M. Theo. Kearney, the general man
ager of the Raisin Growers' Association,
bald the membership fee of $5 was capi
tal stock. The grower would always be
entitled to receive his $5 back if he with
drew from the association. It represents
the value of the membership.
J. H. Henry moved that the membership
matter be laid aside urrtil the form of
contract could be agrted upon. Then
growers would know what they were go
ing to sign. J. R. Lewis seconded the mo
tion and it carried unanimously.
The green fruit men again inquired when
they were to meet, but they were asked
to remain and see what the dried fruit
men did. R. L. Stephens and C. \V. Childs
urged this.
Judge J. R- Lewis was then asked to
read and explain the co-operative act of
1835, under which organization is to be ef
fected. This he did. It provides that each
member shall have equal rights and each
member one vote. There is no capital
stock, but membership certificates are is
sued. No member shall be responsible in
dividually or personally liable tor, any
debts or liabilities of the association in
excess of his proportion of indebtedness.
Membership cannot be transferred with
out the consent of the directors. The
members can also limit the indebtedness
that can be created. There can be no
voting by proxy, but a secret ballot by
mail is provided. A two-thirds vote of all
members can dissolve the association.
A motion by J. H. Henry that that por
tion of the report of the committee dn or
ganization that refers to the co-operative
act be adopted was carried.
At the afternoon session the considera
tion of the contract to be entered into be
tween the grower and the association was
taken up. It provides that the grower
turn over his entire crop to tbo associa
tion, which shall attend to the packing
and sale of the fruit and pay the grower
a pro rata of the profits.
C. D. Blanc-y moved the adoption of. the
contract as read, with the addition of a
vc ction providing that members of the as
sociation may dispose of green prunes for
drying to any other member of the asso
ciation. C. W. Chllds seconded this mo
tion.
M. Theo. Kearny thought the contract
should be amended so that fruit sold
green should when dried not be outside
of the control of the association.
Major YV. A. Coulter suggested that
members be allowed to sell green fruit to

INTERESTS
Decisive Action Taken by
the Informal Convention
at San Jose.

Form of Contract Is Agreed Upon
and the Adoption of By-Law3
Will Be the Next Step.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 15.â The marketing
of the dried fruit crop of California
was to-day practically taken from
hands of speculators and placed un
der the management of an associa
tion of the growers. This was ef
fected through the organization of the
dried-fruit men under the name of the
California Fruit Growers' Association.
The meeting, which convened at the
Unitarian church this morning, is the
greatest gathering of dried-fruit men
Â«vcr held, both in numbers and work ac
complished. Fully 1000 persons were pres
ent, the church being taxed to its full
capacity, and many were unable to secure
E&ats. *At least 500 of this number were
delegates, over twenty counties being
represented. Prominent horticulturists
from ail parts of the State are in attend
ance, among them being A. H. Naftzger
of the Orange Growers' Association, M.
Tneo. Kearny of the Raisin Growers*
Association, R. L. Stephens of Sacra
mento, Alexander Gordon of Fresno, A.
K. Sprague of Los Angeles, B. M. Lelong.

urganization was effected under the co
operative act of ISDS, a form of contract
adopted, and all that remains now is the
adoption of the by-laws and election of of
::.-. rs.
The association will start with a mem
lÂ«-r.-hip that will control fully 75 per cent
of the dried prune crop, and Inside of a
month it expects to have control of the
entire output of the State.
There has been no opposition and there
is but one idea among all in attendance
and that is to organize to protect the fruit
industry.
M. Theo. Kearny stated this evening
that the auspices surrounding the organi
zation of the dried-fruit men were ex
ceedingly bright, much more so than
when me raisin growers organized. HÂ«
vras satisfied that next year they would
control the crop.
S. P. Zanders, chairman of the com
mittee appointed by the State Fruit Grow
ers' Committee- to arrange for the con
vention, called the meeting to order short
ly after 10 o'clock. After reading the call
tr.at had been Issued to the gTowers he
s*iiid that the committee of twenty-one ap
j>oiKt*>Â«i to arrange for this convention
riad worked hard. Cheering messages
had been received by mail and all fruit
growers had shown great enthusiasm in
the movement. This had given hopes
and earnest purposes to improve the in
custry of those meeting here to-day. He
urged that ail organization be effected
and etated the selection of a chairman
would be in order.
Judge J. R. Lewis said this was the
roust important meeting ever held in
Santa Clara County and the best audience
ever gathered in San Jose. Judge H. G.
Bond of Santa Clara, the speaker said,
was a suitable man to preside over such
c. convention, and he named him for the
place. Judge Aikcn seconded the nomi
nation anJ Mr. Bond was the unanimous
choice of the convention.
Judge Bend thanked the convention for
the honor bestowed upon him. He said the
purpose of the convention was to devise
means for the handling of the. fruit
products of the coast. At present the
growers were working in the same primi
tive manner as when the fruit industry
was in Its infancy. The advent of the
railroads had cieated a new condition of
things and increased the facilities of dis
tribution. As the productions of all classes
became greater the extension of the
market was necessary. The natural evo
lution of trade was organization. He cited
the Standard Oil Company and other
great organizations to show what thor
ough organization had done. Judge Bond
paid the question for the convention to
decide was "whether the dried fruit men
Â¦would organize: not whether you will rec
ognize the universal tendency in the mer
cantile world to organize for the protec
tion and benefit of your chosen industry. '
The chairman announced that it was
proposed to organize under the co-opera
tive act of ISSS. In that organization each
prune grower will have one vote, and no
man can have a monopoly.
F. M. Rightcr moved that Alfred C.
Barstow be made secretary of the con
vention. Judge Hurlburt named H. B.
Stabler of Yuba for the position. Each
of the nominees declined in favor of the
other. This was settled, however, by
Stabler being elected secretary and Bar
stow assistant secretary.
On motion of Judge J. R. Lewis the fol
lowing were elected vice presidents of the
convention: W. 11. Aiken of Wrights; A.
Block, J. H. Henry, S. B. Hunklns, G. M.
Bpwman and S. F. Leib of San Jose; M.
Theo. Kearney and AlexGordon of Fresno;
B. F. Walton. T. Kirk, Alden Anderson,
H. Dutard and G. W. Hume of Los Gatos;
Judge B. G Hurlburt and Colonel Phllo
Hersey of San Jose and W. O. Davis of
Sacramento.
The question as to whether the grÂ»en
fruit men were to hold a meeting or not
then came up. Mr. North of Sacramento
suggested that the green fruit men 'â¢Â¦ait
until the dried fruit men had organized.
Judge Lewis suggested that the report
of the committee on organization appoint

without there being any real power In
the commission or any other tribunal or

and they are substantially of one mind in
desiring that this and other defects In the
statute be promptly remedied. Shippers

unanimous in favor of a single classifica

COMMERCE COMMISSION
APPEALS TO CONGRESS
Asks for the Enactment of Laws
That Shall Back Up Its
Rulings.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 15.â The* Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day made pub
lic its thirteenth annual- report. The fea
ture of the report is the strong plea made
that Congress uphold the hands of the
commission by amendments making the
interstate commerce law more effective.
The report says that the commission a
year ago called attention to the fact that
in vital respects the present law had
proved defective and inadequate, and that
until further legislation were provided
the best efforts at regulation must be
feeble and disappointing, yet not a line
on the statutes had been changed and
none of the burdensome conditions which
called for relief had been moved or
modified.
VThe existing conditions and the de
velopments of the past year," it is added,
"render more imperative than ever before
the necessity for speedy and suitable
legislation. Nine-tenths of the people
know that any railroad company can
charge for Its service whatever Itpleases
city. "When he died he left his widow a
large fortune.
Relatives fought to break the Coronet
will, producing in court what purported,
to have been another instrument cutting
down Mrs. Coroners portion of the estate
to a minimum. The second Instrument,
after a long and tedious trial, was de
clared a forgery-
The widow's attorneys in that case were
Governor Henry T. Gage and Senator
Stephen M. White. The Governor arrived
here several days ago for the pur
pose of trying the case. He deter
mined to settle the matter out of
court for the best interests of all con

charges of alleged misconduct upon tha

the party of the first part to the president of
the association. - . .
The amendment was adopted unani
mously.
The consideration of by-laws was next
taken up. They provide for a board of
eleven directors, six of whom shall con
stitute a quorum. They shall be elected
by the stockholders and serve one year.
Their power is such that they can con
duct the affairs of the association. The
indebtedness they can create Is limited to
$25,000. They shall elect a president, two
vice presidents, a secretary and treasurer.
Each director shall receive $10 for each
meeting attended. An executive commit
tee, consisting of the president and two
directors. Is provided for. The salary of
the president is fixed at $500 per month
and that of the other members of the ex
ecutive committee al $300 per month each.
Annual meetings shall be held the first
Monday in June of each year.
Before any action was taken on the pro
posed laws the question of adjournment
came up. Cards were circulated for signa
tures, and about 100 prominent prune
growers signed them. Adjournment was
taken till to-morrow at 10 o'clock.
The <â¢ convention will conclude its work
to-morrow. After the adoption of the by
laws the election of directors will take
place. It is expected there will be a lively
fight for the salaried offices.

JENKINS ON
A QUINTETTE
OF WINNERS
California Rider in Great Form,
Three Beaten Choices .
at Tanforan.
! Clem JeTikir.*. tfce cr^sstimlng yercng j
California rider. dliKinjruished himself j
yesterday by putting Sve winners over ;
the plate at Tanforaa and Just failing to;
make it six straight by tfce scarcest of j
fceads. He began by getting home first en
the 44 to 1 chance. Alary's Garter, fol- |
lowing It sp with an easy win astride {
Lady Meddlesome, a 3 to 1 second choice. !
Next, with the leg up on Slg Levy. Clem f
had the misfortune to lose out to Sofala j
by the r.arro-arest cf margins. He then |
ecored three straight victories with Mont ;
Eagle, Daiyy F and Theory. Tfcracgh his j
clever saddle work acd gentlemanly de- 1
portment Jer.klr-s ma-ie a pronounced hit j
In the far Eastern country, and a* he 1
t-egan at the foot ef the ladder on the >
iocai traxk It Is a pleasure to record his :
successes.
The track was a triSe slow from a light
downpour of rain, which fact did not ]
prevent son* fast tlrae being hung out. j
Three favorites were successful
The racing opened with a five furlong j
scramble, for which Gusto, from the ',
stable of Huphey Jones, west to the post !
favorite. It proved a bad selection, for ?
the coit never displayed a particle of ;'
ep*e<i. Alary's Garter, a 44 to 1 chance, :
made aJI the running, winning hands {
down. In a hard drive Thorpe brought i
Beautiful Bill up. petting the place by a !
nose from First Shot.
Andy Blakeleys mare. Lady Meddle- !
some turned vp an easy winner of the !
mil* selling event, with 3 to 1 about her j
in the ring. Racing out in the lead to j
the stretch with the favorite. Storm King. ;
she there drew away, getting the decision j
cleverly from Tom Cromwell by a length, j
The first ehcice was a close third.
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber's handy :
Â£I!v. &ofa.la; made it three straight in the !
three-furlong scramble for two-year-olds, j
Again a pronocaced favorite ehe earned
the decision from Sig Levy by a short
head. M. F. Tarpey ran a good third.
After many trials and tribulations I
Jenkins managed to land Mont Eagle j
winner of the second mile selling run.
Cut cff.cn two or three occasions the]
gelding eventually won. eaj=ily<from a poor j
lot. Antoinetta led out Aiienna for place j
honors.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap fell
to the favorite. Daisy F. Carroll's mare :
faced the barrier a J to 5 favorite, and :
taking the lead in the stretch, finished j
over a ienerh before Zoroaster a.t the ;
wire. Ventoro quit badly, but held a ;
tight grip on the *how.
In the closing event Theory laid away !
a choice collection of speed quite Impos- ;
Ingriy. Three to one was laid against her >
and she beat Harry Thoburn. a 13 to 1
shot, with something to epare. Behind ;
them followed Mocorito, High HoÂ«. St.
Casimer and Ben I>rdl.

SOLLY SMITH IN LUCK.
Referee Decides His Bout With Frank
Patterson a Draw.
NEW YORK. Jan. 15.â Frank Patterson
cf this city ar.d Solly Smith cf Los An
geles, fotrght , twenty-five rounds to a
draw to-night before the Hercules Ath
letic Club. Patterson was the aggressor
throughout. In the fifth round he put
Solly to the flcror with a right Ewir.sr on
the head, and again in the sevnth Frank
sent Solly to his hands and knees from a
right-hand swing, his forearm catching
Smith on the back of the neck. His boiy
blows made Smith jump and wince several
times. These seemed to hurt the Califor
r.ian more than any others Patterson
landed. "Â»'â¢*. m
Smith was by no means idle meanwhile,
and he got Patterson's head and face with
right swings time after time, as well as
sending lefts to the neck and light and
left drives to the wind. Patterson block id
most of the Californian's body blows. To
ward the close of tbc bout Patterson was
still on the aggressive and outpointed
Smith. He sent Solly down twice in the
final round with right and left swings ca
the. Jaw. Despite- Patterson's advantage
the referee declared the bout a draw.
REVERSAL OF FORM.
Frank MrConnell's Owners. Trainer
and Jockey in Trouble.
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 15.â Donna Rita
was the only winning favorite to-day and
she was put to her best to stall off Frank
McCormell. who was closing fast at the
end. Frank McCcnnell's performance dif
fered so widely from his last one that
the owners, the trainer and Jockey
Thompson have been suspended pending
an Investigation. The weather was
threatening and the track fast. Results:
Seven -furlongs. s*!Hrgâ Ben Frost won. By

TROY, N. V., Jan. 15.â Dick Moore of
St. Paul was given the decision after tour
rounds of what was to have been a twen
ty-round go with Charlie Gofl! of San
Francisco at the Manhattan Athletic Club
to-night. Goff had the better of the con
test, but struck Moore after the gong at
the close of the fourth round. A free fljrht
was prevented, but Billy Madden, Goff's
trainer, refu&ed to allow his man to con
tinue, and the referee gave the decision
to Moore. â¢ Â¦
McCONNELL
TIPPED TO
BEAT SMITH
Tim McGrath Expresses Con
fidence â Kennedy, and
Stelzner Matched.
"Tim" McGrath. the well-known trainer,
who has prepared Tom Sharkey for all hi 3
contests and who Is now managing Frank
McConneU, the -young Calif ornlan middle
weight, has written a letter to his per
sonal friend. "Spider" Kelly. In which he
expresses the greatest confidence in Mc-
Conneil's ultimate victory over "Myste
rious" Billy Smith when they step un
der the ropes on the 26th of this month.
He says: .
"Frank Is in good shape and I thick
he will surely defeat Billy Smith. I sec
onded Smith when he fought McKeever
two months ago. and the way they fought
that night Frank could have beaten them
both In the earne ring. Smith thinks
himself the roughest fighter in the world,
but there is one rougher than he, and
that is Frank. You ought to have seen
him punch Handler in the clinches. He is
the best I ever saw. He takes advan
tage of every operJng. Tou know Green
defeated Smith at his old game in Car
son; you will see Frank do the same to
him here. In my opinion. Jimmy Hand
ler can beat Smith. Handler is as tough
a nut I have seen in the ring."
It is too early in the contest for bet
ting, but it is believed that- Frank, Mc-
Connell will be the favorite in the local
poolrooms. His victory over Handler ar.d
the confidence expressed by McGrath will
surely influence the betting. The letter
to Kelly was written from New Dorp.
Etaten Island, where McConneU. under
McGrath's watchful eye, is training for
his contest.
The Monarch Athletic Club, of which
A! Smith is president, has matched Jack
Stelrner ar.d Joe Kennedy to fig-ht In

RING SPORTING EVENTS TRACK
And after the prophecy of Politician
Phil Crlmmms "that he would see grass
growing on the track" has come to pass,
"beautiful Ingieside" will soon be re
openedâthat Is, unlesJs the present policy
outlined by the "Western Turf Association
miscarries. " â¢. ?
When Ingieside track, the property ef
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club, was closed
by lawnearlya year ago and Ed Corrigan
with his band of turf parasites was driven
from the city, the faithful few gathered
together and the great Messiah. Henry
J. Crocker, selected San Mateo County
as the future camping place of the gang.
"Phenix-like from the ashes" grew the
Western Turf Association and Tanforan
Park, with the orange of Burlingame and
the green of Corrigan linked together *s
"otir colors." The new track opened in
November, with Ed Corrigan the major
domo of all thing 3 that happened, al
though it had been extensively circulated
that the ruler of Hawthorne had no hand
in the running ml things.
Smarting all the time under the pain of
having been driven from a happy home to
a hostile land where the natives frowned
on the interloper. Corrigan. Crocker & Co.
have abided their time and now. thinking
the iron Is hot, they intend to strike.
Courting the smiles of a Mayor, they tried
by ever}' known hook or crook to defeat
these apostles of the turf for the coin
there is In It. prostrating themselves be
fore the tribunal and beseeching that the
gates cf Ingieside be again opened.-
San Mateo County has already tired of
its new friends, and it Is said the Super
visors have asked: "How long will this
thing last?" Its residents protest against
being insulted by the rowdy hangers-on of
the track, and its days are numbered.
So certain are the magnates of the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club that Ingieside
win reopen at the term!na.tlon of thÂ» com
ing meeting at Oakland track that all
printing matter has be<Â»n ordered under
name of the Cacific Coast Jockey Club,
with IngJeside .track as the scene of fu
ture operations. If a relief measure can
not be pained through the new Board of
Supervisors, then ,the association will
open In defiance of the law, and the days
of lawlessness and bloodshed at Haw
thorne will be re-enacted. The courts will
be sued for an injunction or any old thing
resorted to. so long as the gates can bÂ«
kept open. If William J. Biggy. the pres
ent Chief of Police, remains in" power, un
til that tlnvi there seems to be breakers
ahtad for Corrigan. Crocker & Co.
An Interesting contest took place on the
linka of the San Francisco Golf Club on
Saturday, the opening day of the profes
elonal tournament at* Oakland. It was an
approach-patting competition and attract

fact of the child being taken away
that is startlicg or interesting, it's
oaly when the method of taking off
ia corel that it excites interest. How

COURT NOTES
John L. Baggey, a longshoreman, was
held to answer yesterday before the Su
perior Court by Judge Cabanlss on the
charge of forgery for forging the name of
Nicholas Uddfolk, an employe on the
lightship, to a check for $50, which he
cashr-d at the sub-treasury.
â¢ Toramatsu Murakami was sentenced
yesterday by Judge Mogan to pay a fine
of $500 with the alternative of six months
in the County Jail for keeping a house of
111-fame at 532 Pine street.
The cases of the inmates of the Hotel
Nymphia, charged with vagrancy, wers
called in Judge Conlan's court yesterday,
and by consent' continued till Saturday.
Robert M. Watson, engineer of the
train that ran over and killed *Mlss Rosle

JOBBERS' DELEGATION STARTS.
President Baker, Manager Ltoveland.
and Their Associates Off for
Chlco.
The delegation representing the Pacinc
Coast Jobbers* and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation, who will appear before the Pa
cific Coast Retail Hardware Dealers' As
sociation at Chlco, started last night for
the north. In the party were President
Wakefleld Baker and Traffic Manager H.
D. Loveland of the Association and W. R
Wheeler and Mr. Scott of the executive
committee. The fact has been developed
that the visit of the St. Louis quartet of
business men who will be present at the
meeting of the retail hardware dealers
was not Invited. They simply have seen
that there was a chance to make an ar
gument before the people among whom
they hope to raise antagonism against
the jobbers of the coast prior to the
meeting of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission, which will open in this city
March 15. and have prepared to do their
best. The delegation of the Pacinc Coast
Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association
will attend in response to an Invitation.
Probably all the 'arguments will be gone
over before the retail hardware men re
specting the differential between the car
load and less than carload shipment.
Then the question will be left to the sober
judgment of the retailers.
MAN AND WIFE ENDORSE SWAMP-ROOT.
Incapacitated for Work by Kidney Trouble and Rheumatism,
Louis Rosenkranz Gives High Praise to Dr. Kilmer's
World-Famous Swamp-Root.
day, when I felt unusually weak and
thought that death was not far awar
from me; I picked up an advertisement
which happened to be lying close by,
and read about the qualities of Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root and what it would
do for human ills that flesh Is heir to.
I threw the paper away, but 'Swamp-
Root* kept dancing before my eye*
until I determined to try it. I sent ona
of the members of my family after two
bottles at a nearby drug storÂ», and
Immediately took the directed dose.
After I had consumed the two bottles
I was able to go downtown after It
myself, and I brought home two more
bottles. By this time the weakness in
the bladder had disappeared entirely
and the pains in my back and lega had
been sensibly diminished. I kept on
taking It. however, until now I hava
consumed eleven bottles, and as a re-
sult I feel better to-day than I have in
ten years. The Swamp-Root seemed to
take hold of the trouble at once, pnd
now all the pains have disappeared. I
propose to continue its use, however,
until I have taken a half dozen mor*
bottles, as I do not want a return o{
the trouble.
"I can say positively that I was cured
of a weak and Irritable bladder by thÂ»
use of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root, anci
I am deeply appreciative of my release
from what was often an embarrassing
and distressing ailment. A man may
enjoy the most perfect health In every
other respect and yet be in continual
misery because of weak bladder. I
now feel bright as a twenty-dollar gold
piece, and consider that my cure has
been effected at a surprisingly low
rate, considering what I have paid to
the doctors for negative results."
CONVINCED OF THE
CURATIVE PROPERTIES
OF SWAMP-ROOT
Kidney Complaint of Years'
Standing Yields to This
Great Vegetable Compound.
Samuel B. Swan Is at present en-
gineer of the Hayes-street power-
house, a position he has occupied for
the past twelve years. Mr. Swan be-
gan filing on engines when he wa3
only 14 years of age, and was a loco-
motive engineer at the early age of 19.
He saw the last spike driven on the
Central Pacific Railroad, and he Is an
enthusiastic advocate of the excellent
curative properties of Dr. Kilmer"3
Swamp-Root. "When a Call reporter In-
terviewed him regarding the subject,
and requested him to give an honest
expression of opinion of the medicine,
he quickly replied:
"You cannot quote me too strongly
as being In favor of Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root- Everybody knowa that
the position of locomotive engineer
acts harmfully on the kidneys, on ac-
count of the constant jar one Is sub-
jected to. That was my case. For
years I suffered with pains In the
back, superinduced by bad action of
my kidneys. Constipation, long con-
tinued, made me a very sick man, and
I consulted a dozen physlcans, none of
whom afforded me any relief. 1 re-
member a brother locomotive en-
gineer, who knew something of medi-
cine, who used to put me up some cap-
sules filled with something or other.
They did me some good, but it was not
lasting.
"Things with me kept getting from
bad to worse, and the pains In my back
became unbearable, when my attention
was attracted to the advertisements of
Dr. Kllmer'a Swamp-Root. I made up
my mind that I would give It a fair
test, and when I undertake to do any-
thing I generally carry it through. I
therefore resolved to take ten bottles,
and'if no good effects resulted I would
discontinue using It. My faith In it
may be understood when I tell you that
I have used fourteen bottles, and I can
truthfully . say that It has done me a
world of good, and I am a better man
to-day than I ever was In my life. I
feel fresh and vigorous, and ascribe It
entirely to my use of Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root. I began by taking it
three times a .day. and now I take It
twice a day. I will reduce the dose to
one spoonful a day, and feel that It will
put me In such a condition that I may
soon stop the use of It altogether. I
will say, however, that I will always
have a bottle handy In case of neces-
sity, as I consider it to be better than a
hundred doctors all rolled into one.
"Put me down as Indorsing the vir-
tues of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root In a
most emphatic manner, because It does
everything and more than claimed by
Its manufacturers."
How to Find Out if You Have
Kidney Trouble and Need
Swamp-Root.
It used to be considered that
only urinary and bladder troubles
were to be traced to the kidneys,
but now modern science proves
that nearly all diseases have their
beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify
the blood â that is their work.
So when your kidneys are sick
you can understand how quickly
your entire body is affected and
how every organ seems to fail to
do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly,"
begin taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, because as soon as
your kidneys are well they will
help all the other organs to health.
Kidney trouble is responsible
for more different kinds of trou-
ble and suffering than any other
disease. Kidney trouble irritates
the nerves, makes you dizzy, rest-
less, sleepless and irritable.
Causes rheumatism and neural-
gia; pain or dull ache in the back,
joints and muscles, makes your
head ache and back ache, causes
indigestion, stomach and liver
trouble; you get a sallow, yellow
complexion; makes you feel as
though you had heart trouble;
you have plenty of ambition, but
no strength, get weak and waste
away.
The cure for these troubles is
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the
world-famous kidney remedy. Â¦
In taking Swamp-Root you af-
ford natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect
healer and gentle aid to the kid-
neys that is known to medical
science.
If there is any doubt in your
mind as to your condition, take
from your urine on rising about
two ounces, place it in a glass or
bottle and let it stand twenty-
four hours. If, on examination,
it is milky or cloudy, if there is
brick dust settling, or if small par-
ticles float about in it, your kid-
neys are in need of immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root should at once be
taken upon the least sign of ill
health. It will make you well, and
is for sale the world over in bot-
tles of two sizes and two prices,
fifty-cent and one dollar.
Swamp-Root is used in the
leading hospitals, recommended
by skillful physicians in their pri-
vate practice, and is taken by doc-
tors themselves who have kidney
ailments, because they recognize
in it the greatest and most suc-
cessful remedy for kidney, liver
and bladder troubles.
To prove its wonderful effi-
cacy, send your name and address
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bingham-
ton, N. V., mentioning that you
read this generous offer in the
San Francisco Call, when you
will receive immediately, free of
all charge, a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root arid a valuable book
by mail, prepaid. This book con-
tains many of the thousands upon
thousands of testimonial letters
received from men and women
cured. Swamp-Root is so remark-
ably successful that our readers
are advised to write for a free
sample bottle, and to be sure and
state that they read this generous
offer in the San Francisco Call.
If you are already convinced
that Swamp-Root is what you
need you can purchase the regu-
lar fifty-cent and one-dollar size
bottles at the drug stores every-
where.
TOOK SWAMP-ROOT
UNDER PROTEST
Found It Wonderfully Effica-
cious in Ptomaine Poison-
ing, Malaria and Stomach
Trouble.
Elbridge C. Hutchlnson, who labors
at his arduous duties of pipemaker for
the Francis Smith Company, was seen
at his residence, 432 Seventh street, and
when the reporter asked for his opinion
of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root he began
to extol the remedy In the highest
terms.
"I may not be competent to judge of
the merits of the Swamp-Root, because
I have been using It for a few days only,
but I am sure when you hear of thÂ«
circumstances under which I com-
menced using It you will agree with me
that^ it Is indeed a most wonderful
remedy.

STEAMER CHINA
FROM HONOLULU
IN QUARANTINE
More Plague Victims
in the Islands.
MATTERHORN STORM TOSSED
F. tf. SMITH AND McDOWELL IN
A COLLISION.
Transports Olympia and Pennsyl
vania Arrive' From Manila â Ma
rlon Chilcott Loses Her
Deckload.
The Pacific Mall Company's steamer
China arrived early yesterday morninc
from the Orient. She was detained thirty
four hours at Honolulu, where she landed
â¬41 Japanese and put a large quantity of
freight Into lighters. None of the crew
were In communication with the shore nor
did the steamer bring any passengers or
freight from the islands. Nevertheless
the Quarantine Officer here would not take
ar.y chances and the China had to go to
Ar.geJ Island, where she will be fumigat
ed. The cabin passengers were allowed to
land. The officers of the mall steamer
who came ashore with the mall say there
have been twenty-two deaths from the
plague at Honolulu and that five suspi
cious cases were under surveillance.
The China brought up M cabin. 4 second
cabin and ISJÂ» Chinese passengers. She
Â¦was twenty-five days from Hongkong, fif
teen from Yokohama and five days thir
teen hours from Honolulu. The passage
was an uneventful one save for the deten
tion at Honolulu.
The China brings the news that the
American ship Marion Chilcott lost her
decK'.oad of lumber in a terrific storm. No
OJie aboard wa.< injured. The Marion Chil
cott was from Chemainus. B. C, for Ade
laide, Australia, and sailed from the
Sound In company with the Helen N.
KlxnbalL The latter vessel has arrived at
Hiio, Hawaiian Islands, and it was she
that brought the news of the disaster to
the Marion Chilcott.
The overdue shii> Matterhorn arrived
from Antwerp yesterday after a passage
of 169 days. The run is not considered a
lor.g one, but the Matterhorn is a fast ship
ana the underwriters pot scared and of
fered 10 per cent to reinsure their chances.
The Mattcrhorn had a terrible time of It
o!T the Horn during the month of October.
The heavy seas washed the tarpaulins off
the hatches, carried away the oil and
lamp lockers and poop staircase, smashed
in the doors of the deckhouse, wrenched
several side ports off their hinges, while
threÂ« of tbc lower topsails Â¦were blown
Â«v . v.. . The vessel was nearly around the
Horn on October 11. but was driven back
to longitude â¬2 west and it was not until
the Jirst week in November that she final
ly got into the Pacinc. The Matterhorn
carries a very valuable general cargo.
The transports Olympia and Pennsylva
nia did not do any racing on their way
hpre from Nagasaki. The Pennsylvania
was twenty-two days making the run, the
Olympia beating her time by twenty-eight
hours. Both vessels had some very heavy
weather off the Japan coast. On one oc
caMon the wind blew with hurricane force
and the barometer was down to 25.40.
The Manauense was in port at Nagasaki
when the Pennsylvania arrived there, and
mailed one day ahead of that vessel for
San Francisco.' She had a crew of Fili
pino firemen, so it may be several days
before t*he gets here. Everything had
gone well on the Manauense during the run
from Manila to Nagasaki and the officers
on thÂ« I'ennsylvania say the Btories that
reached here aijout the vessel were very
much exaggerated.
The Olympia brought up the following
passengers: Colonel C. D. Vlcle. Fourth
<avalry: Ray L.. Quaekenbuph. civil ser
vice clerk: U. J. McCord of Company G,
First California. William Wallis, chief
engineer; William Mair. first assistant
engineer; L. G. Edward, chief steward;
William Wiggins and Thomas Cullom,
oilers; B. Elliott, gtznner; Fred Rose, sea
man: Henry Dougherty, assistant electri
cian; Charles Cooper, butcher, and Nor
man Down?, third stewardâ ail of the
wrecked cable ship Hooker. C. D. Moront-
Fas. supercargo of the steamer Pak Ling,
fi. E. de Rackin of the New York Sun,
A. P. Smilery. quartermaster's clerk; W.
J. Hfll. commercial clerk, and Herbert
M. Brace of Company X, First Califor
ii!a.
The Per.nFylvar.la brought up the fol
lowing: Sergeant George Scott of Com
pany X, Twenty-second Infantry. Scott
lias been thirty years in the service and
comes home to go on the retired list.
Albert Tupper is a Portland boy. who
ran away from home and went to Ma
r.ila as a mascot. He is only 15 years old
and has had aJI he wants of camp life.
Albert came home on the Pennsylvania
and will go to Portland on the Columbia
In a day or two. C. C. Cox and H. J.
Johnson, two commissariat clerks, also
came home on the transport.

Four prisoners made a successful break
for liberty last Sunday night about 8

FINED TOR CONTEMPT.
President John Hackett Mulcted in
the Sum of $700 and Costs.
John Hackett. president of the Pacific
Coast Dredging and Reclamation Com
pany, was fined $700 and costs yesterday
by United States Circuit Judge Morrow
for contempt of court. The alternative
was ninety days' imprisonment.
There were two charges of contempt
against Hackett In the case of A. B. Bow
ers vs. Pacinc Coast Dredging and Re
clamation Company for an alleged in
fringement of the plaintiff's patent hy
draulic dredging machine. Judge Mor
row issued a perpetual injunction against
the defendant company, prohibiting it
from using the excavating machine which
Mr. Bowers alleged was an infringement
on his patent. The penalty was imposed
upon Mr. Hackett as president of the de
fendant corporation.
Louis Rosenkranz. who is employed with "W. W. Montague & Co..
was interviewed by a reporter at his residence, 387 Harriet street,
and he could not say enough In praise of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
His constant bending over In his work brought on a serious condition of
the kidneys, besides rheumatic attacks, which incapacitated him from
work. He had lost so many days and consequent wages that his wife, after
much persuasion, induced him to take Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root/ which
she had occasionally used with satisfactory results. The story of his ex-
perience is best told In his own words:
"I was beginning to feel very much discouraged," said Mr. Rosenkranz.
"The pains In my back were terrific, and I began to feel the symptoms of
that dread disease, rheumatism. It became very monotonous to be obliged
to go to bed every once in a while for a few days and then only get a tem-
porary relief from the doctors I called In. My wife began to lose patience
with me because debts began to pile up against my little household, and she
finally persuaded me to give Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial at least. I
did so, and I have used four bottles, with surprisingly good results. The
pains have entirely left me, and I can safely say that I have now not a
particle of kidney trouble, all on account of using the Swamp-Root, which
I was at first inclined to deride. It has proved a godsend to jny family and
myself."
Mrs. Rosenkranz was an attentive listener to her husband's favorable
opinions of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, and when he had finished his com-
plimentary observations she added her meed of praise to the curative prop-
erties of the Swamp Root."
"I have always kept a bottle of the Swamp-Root In the house." she said,
"and it has never failed me in the hour of necessity. .1 must relate one par-
ticular instance of its beneficial effects among a great many others. A
few days ago I was taken with frightful pains in the stomach after eat-
ing some radishes. The pains became most excruciating, and they presently
commenced to shoot through every member of my body, and I thought I
would go crazy. In my agony I completely forgot the presence of a bottle
of Swamp-Root in the house, and my husband was about to go for a doc-
tor when I happened to think of it. I made known that I wanted my favor-
ite medicine, and my husband gave me a double dose. After an hour, dur-
ing which the pains gradually subsided, I passed off into peaceful slumber,
and in the morning, when the medicine had acted, I was able to go about
my household duties, though naturally I felt very weak from the terrible
experience of the night before. I took the Swamp-Root for several days,
and since then I have felt perfectly well. 1 can safely recommend the
Swamp-Root for the maladies to which everybody Is subject, and I am
a witness to the wonderful results obtained in the case of my husband."
nounced It a case of ptomaine poison-
ing. I kept getting worse and worse
and was obliged to call in another
doctor. Between the two, I was enabled
to get out of bed and go to my labors'
at the end of three weeks. I worked
for a day or two and felt that It would
be necessary for me to go back to bed.
This would have proved a great hard-
ship to me, as I had already lost three
weeks' wages and did not know how
long I would be obliged to remain in
bed.
"My wife had a sample bottle of Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root In the house,
and she urged me to try it. I refused
at first, saying that it would not help
me, but at her earnest solicitations I
took a dose as a last resort. Wonder-
ful to relate, I felt better after the
medicine had performed its functions,
and I kept on taking it. I continued to
improve, and after the sample bottle
was exhausted I bought a large bottle.
I must tell you, that I did not take to
my bed during all this time, -but went
to my daily work without any Interrup-
tion, and I assure you I felt grateful to
Dr. Kilmer for his discovery of the
astonishing properties of Swamp-
Root.
"Before my attack of ptomaine
poisoning, I suffered a great deal from
malaria and stomach trouble. My sys-
tem became so run down that I was
unable to withstand yie effects of the
ptomaine poisoning, and so was obliged
to take to my bed. I struck the root of
my trouble, however, when I began
taking Swamp-Root for my kidneys,
which caused the pains in my back.
Thanks to the persistence of my wife,
I tried it, and Its effects have been al-
most magical. It took effect at once,
and I think it has been a mental stim-
ulus as well as a physical restorative.
In a few days I have gained. in strength,
and no longer feel that tired sensation
after a day's work which I felt hither-
to. All praise to Dr. Kilmer for the
good he is doing, has done, and will do
for suffering humanity with his
Swamp-Root, for he has indeed been a
life saver to me."
OPINION ON STREET REPAIR.
City Attorney Lane Advises the
Board of Public Works.
The Board of Public Works received an
opinion from City Attorney Lane that cer
tain moneys, aggregating 54307 16, held by
ex-Superintendent of Streets Fragley for
deposits on account of building, sewer
and kettle permits, will, under the char
ter, pass to the control of the board. The
moneys, however, are to be returned to
the depositors in the event that no dam
ages result to the city from the use of
streets under such permits.
In all cases where the street is torn up
a written application shall be made to the
board for permission to do so. After a
deposit sufficient to cover the expense has
been made, the board must have the
work done, either by contract or day's
labor. The City Attorney says that this
provision is not intended to cover cases
of emergency, such, for instance, as a
break in a water or gas pipe.
"I would therefore advise," he con
cludes, "that you suggest to the Board of
Supervisors a suitable ordinance under
which your board may have power, with
out the formalities of a petition and an
estimate, to do this emergency work. A
deposit should be exacted from all cor
porations, or others using the streets, suf
ficiently large to cover all likely contin
gencies. But the control of the work
must not be taken from the Board of
Public Works, nor Its responsibility there
for in any way cut off."

perience In the use of the medicine:
"Some years ago I was taken with a
weakness of the bladder and pains In

A PARISIAN PLAGUE.
WHEN" you go to Paris this summer take your
rat terrier with you. You will probably need
him yourself, and if. not you can dispose of him
to advantage. You can even sell him to the landlord
of your hotel without fear of having him served up
to you as lamb cutlets, for at present in Paris rat
terriers are worth more than spring lambs.
The demand for terriers is due to the fact that the
construction of the new exposition buildings has
brought upon Paris a plague the like of which has
never been seen since the day? when the rats overran
the town of Hamelin. It appears that the sewers in
the city have for years afforded for rats a refuge where
they had nothing to fear and where they bred in large
numbers. In making excavations for the new build
ings along the banks of the Seine the rats were dis-'
turbed, and, being forced out of the sewers, took
refuge in the neighboring houses and in the markets.
; It is stated by a correspondent of the London Morn
ing Post that Dr. Henry Thiery of the City Hygiene
Service has published a report of the extent of the
evil, but without being able to suggest a satisfactory
remedy for it. According to statements taken from
this report, the rats are so numerous in the districts
near the river that the inhabitants are afraid to allow
their children to cross the garden or the courtyard
after dark. The markets have been infested to such an
extent that rat-hunting has been abandoned in de
spair. It is statea that on Acheres Plain rats esti
mated to be ten thousand in number have been seen
at once on two acres of ground planted with beets.
An interesting detail of the story is that the cat?
in Paris, which are very numerous, live on the best
of terms with the rats. It is asserted they can be seen
trotting about together. The city cat has lost its
reputation in Paris. He or she still enjoys killing a
ruoiise". but with other food to hand a rat has become
rather large game from the fe4ine point of view. For
thi? reason the Budget Commission suppressed this
year the credits for the cats kept in the storehouses of
?he Ministry of War. The cat as an official is now
only to be found at the Ministry of Finance and the
Council of State.

JOHN FOGARTY'S DEATH
Ex-Deputy Fruit Inspector Passes
Away After a Few Hours*
Sickness.
John J. â¢ Fogarty. a bartender by occu
pation and formerly a deputy fruit in
spector, died suddenly yesterday morning
with symptoms of ptomaine poisoning. He
came home to his residence at 1019 Poartll
street half an hour after noon last Sun
day from the Bowhead saloon, corner of
Clay and East streets, where he was- em
ployed, suffering with cramps. His symp

SISTER CORA SEAWELL of the
Episcopal sisterhood is no more.
She passed away suddenly
some time, on Sunday evening
at 1513 Jackson street. Mrs. William
F. Lorey, at whose residence Sister
Cora made her home, found the no
ble woman stretched cold in death on
the floor of her room earjy yesterday
morning. The Loreys reported the sis
ter"3 death to the Coroner and the
body was removed to the Morgue. The
sister who had attended the last hours
of so many passed away unattended
and alone.
Sister Cora was one of the most
zealous of all the Episcopal sisters and
was known for her cheerful disposi
tion, kindness to all and unselfishness.
She labored early and late in the
cause, and in her passing away the
poor sick and needy have lost a good
friend.
At the time of her death Sister Cora
was connected with St. Alban's Mis
sion, but had been previously perma
nently identified with St. Luke's.
THE INCURABLY INSANE.
THE meeting of the lowa Legislature and the
report thereto of the Board of Control, a body
corresponding to the Board of Charities and
Corrections in some other States, ha? disclosed an
astounding condition of affairs in that State affecting
the incurably insane.
It seems that when insane patients m either ot
the :hree asylums lor that class m tnat State are de
c:dcd to be incurabje they are returned to the coun
ties whence they were sent. As their families, if they
h-"Â».ve any, cannot care for. them and they canr.ot be
kept in the common jail, there lias grown tip a sys
tem of cor.Sning them in the county poo'rhouses, and
xr. every county there is, as an adjunct to the poor
house, a pen of some sort for the unfortunate insane.
The result is the dotting of the State -*ith ninety
nine dens in which these incurables are confined. In
some case* they are chained to the floor; in no ca^o
can they have that care and attention to their per
sonal cleanliness and welfare most necessary to the
wholly demented, and without which it is much bet
ter to give them euthanasia by some merciful means
that will wholly put out their darkened light.
This report of the Board of Control reads like a
chapter out. of the far past, before science had wrested
the interests of the insane :rom the grasp oi supersti
tion, and before the world had learned that the brain,
being an organ with mind as its innction, was natur
ally subject to physical disorder and impairment of its
(dictions like the other organs. We believe that- in no
other State in the Union has the interning cf the insane
:r pofirhouses existed lor many years. >o apology
can be made for it that squares with humanity, sci
ence or the policy of modern civilization, which is
to take under the best care society can provide those
who are disinherited of mind or fortune, and inca
pable of caring for themselves. We had supposed
that the Â» orld had so far outgrown the lowa system.
that to find it in force there is like discovering a tribe
of troglodytes, led by the man who left his skull in
the Neanderthal Cave for the purposes of scientific
speculation. It h like finding the rack and thumb
screw somewhere in use as a property of courts used
ja the administration of justice to extort confessions
to be used against the victim.
No matter what claims poorhouse stewards may
make as to their treatment of such unfortunates.
every alienist and every observer of those who--?
minds are disordered knows that even with the best
intentions proper care is impossible under such con
ditions. In the county infirmaries in California it
is not uncommon to find a trained physician as su
perintendent. These infirmaries are the analogue of
the lowa poorhouse, but the latter is in charge al
ways of a non-rr.edical man, and is only visited occa
sionally by the County Physician, who administers
bread pills and drowsy Â«yrups to the poor for a fixed
salary. Under such a system the insane are sure not
to have proper care.
There has been complaint of the number of insane
asylum* in California. Their ntrmber is due to the
fact that here all the insane in the State are furnished
with the best and most enlightened care that science
and humanity can give them. At Agnews Asylum
the incurably insane are specially cared for. It was
built for them and they are sent from the other in
stitutions to end their darkened days there. But even
there science and diagnosis do not jtand with help
less hands in their pockets. Observations, treatment,
the means of final cure are all the time in action, and
there is afforded even- encouragement to a favorable
change and final cure for those who enter the place
in that merely vegetable state that indicates total de
icentia.
It is said that the lowa system was adopted for
economical reason*, but we insist that no modern
State can afford that kind of economy. California lias
borne the burden of the best C2rc attainable for her in
sane and has been criticized abroad for their number,
confined in five asylums. We have now a suspicion
that if the insane of lowa were cared for in like man
ner and registered in State institutions, it will be found
that she has had as many as *c and has cared for them
with far less humanity. The whole Union will await
with interest the effect upon the lowa Legislature of
this report of the Board of Control. One of the
members of that board iÂ« William Larrabee. who has
bren three times Governor of that State, and an
other is Judge L. G. Kinne, who has served a fu'l
term as Justice of the Supreme Court, so that what
the board s.ays has behind it authority of unquestioned
personal eminence.
The people of California may well felicitate them
selves that while there has been occasional misman
agement of our insane institutions it has been con
fined to the merely political part of their administra
tion and has rarely touched their scientific and hu
mane side

In the debate on the financial bill Congressman
Boutell read a number of letters from Thomas Jef
ferson, with the object of showing that the illustrious
author of the Declaration of Independence was not
sc good a Democrat as the Bryanites claim. In one of
them Jefferson asks a friend ahout to visit England
to make inquiries at the Herald's office for the anus
of the Jefferson family, and says: 'It is possible
there may be none. If so I would, with your assist
ance, become a purchaser, having Sterne's word for
it that a coat of arms may be purchased as cheap
as any other, coat." The letter, is interesting, but it
is hardly. fair to draw from it the conclusion Mr.
Boutell does. It shows that Jefferson wished a coat
of arms as a family ornament popular in Virginia at
that time, but.it also shows that he was indifferent
whether he got it from his ancestors or had to buy
it for himself, and in that indifference lies the element
of democracy.

FRENCH CANADIAN SENTIMENT.
WE recently referred to the latent leenng in
France in relation to the final recover}- to her
sovereignty of all territory that had been lost
by conquest, including that portion of old Acadie
now included in the Dominion of Canada. We as
serted that this feeling was shared by the French
Canadians as it is by the French of Alsace and Lor
raine. At the time of our publication of this view
â¢ome doubts were expressed whether it was true as to
the French in Canada. Having been more than a cen
tury an*d a quarter under British rule, incorporate.l
into the empire and enjoying their share of elective
control of the Dominion, and having at present one
<->f t^Â«Â«ir r-Â«TT!h<*r the Hon. Wilfrid Laurier. as Pre-
mier and actual ruler of all the Canadas, it was sup
posed that no discontent lingered among them and
I that the British conquest of 1762 had been forgotten.
I But it is not forgotten. Those who desire to study the
i philosophy of conquest may find material in the facts
|oC the French situation in Canada. Indeed we recall
I no instance in history in which a conquered people
I ever forgot the humiliation of their subjection. It is
transmitted from generation to generation, and is a
â¢entiment that survives the centuries. With this im
mortality of aversion and the spirit of revenge which
goes hand in hand with it all conquerors must
reckon. In thÂ« time of their conquest glory gilds the
act. and the generation which exults in its power and
gayly cries "Woe to the conquered!" passes away
without feeling the long-cherished hate which will fall
upon its remote successors.
This is exactly the situation in Canada. The im
perial policy of the elder Pitt, though carried out by
other?, added Acadie to the empire, but it brought
with it a plague spot of undying hate. The French
organ in Quebec has just published an editorial ap
peal to the French spirit, in which it says: "The peo
ple of the earth have at length awakened from their
stupor and their torpor with regard to England and
have solemnly branded her the great corruptress of
the globe, the unjust dominatrix, the queen of evil
and misfortune. They are preparing now to cast her
finder the ban of the civilized world. All the accumu
lated wrath of three centuries may be suddenly and
brusquely let loose in a terrible tempest which shall
overwhelm and cast down this colossus. At present
England carries herself with a superb arrogance which
seems to defy not only all the peoples of the earth,
but to carry itself to heaven. Who knows how soon
she may crave mercy of the nations she has so inso
lently treated and humbly ask that they leave her a
few fragments of her ancient empire? And when
ether peoples shall have burst their yoke, shall the
French Canadians continue to endure its oppression?
The chances of the fight, so long favorable to the
oppressors, are at last with us. More complete still
will be our emancipation if the United States are en
veloped in the same punishment with England, as
they have shared with her the odium of the same sys
tem of oppression and domination of others. We
have seen the opposition to the French Canadian race
which has shown itself in Americanism and which is
indeed the basis and essence of it. If that insolent
republic be humiliated with England, and if the Eng
lish race be stricken in Europe and America by the
justice of man and the justice of heaven, it will be
less insolent to the rest of the world and will leave
to French Canadians to freely develop â¢ their own
country-"
Futile? Yes, but no less an impressive evidence 01
the immortality of a sense of injustice that never dies
among the conquered. It is fed and strengthened,
from generation to generation, by differences of race
and religion, and some time it takes its place and
strikes as part of the widespread catastrophe which
is the end of all government based on conquest.
Such sentiments would not be published under the
British flag if they did not command the sympathy of
those to whom they are addressed.
They have a certain interest in this country be
cause Canadian annexation to the United States is
cherished in some quarters here and has supporters
among* the English in Canada. But we want no in
corporation of British conquests into this republic,
which carry with them a hostile and indignant peo
ple. We have sufficient trouble on our hands in the
bad title we have bought of Spain, which comes to us
seamed and scarred with the revenges of three cen
turies of her misrule and with its bar sinister further
emphasized by the immortal antagonisms created on
our own account-
If it shall prove that England's reputation has
grown by mere sufferance of the other nations,
swollen because unchallenged by any civilized foe. it
will appear that the French Canadian estimate of the
situation is not without warrant.

PLAYING CARDSâ C. S.. St. John. Cal.
Playing cards are known to be of Eastern
origin, but when or by whom first intro
duced cannot be ascertained. It is, how
ever, tolerably certain that they origi
nated in Arabia and were brought into
Europe during the crusades. In an an
cient "History of the Garter" there Is an
extract from a wardrobe account of Ed
ward I. dated 1377, in which a game called
the "four kings" Is mentioned. As Ed
ward, before his ascension to the throne,
resided for some years In Syria, he may
have learned to play cards while in that
country. They were certainly introduced
into Europe in the fourteenth century and
they are said to have been brought to
Viterbo by the Saracens In 1379. From
the fact that an entry occurs in the treas
ury books of France of "50 sols of France
paid to Jacquemin Gringonneur for three
packs of cards for the amusement' of the
King" (Charles Vl> In the year 1333â 0na
year after that Kintr lost his reasonâ lt
has been erroneously stated that play
ing cards were invented for his amuse
ment, but they were certainly known In
France before Charles ascended the
throne, for in the romance of "Renard \c
Contrefalt" It is mentioned that cards
were In use m 1340. i .

THE SITUATION IN ASIA.
A RECENT dispatch from London quotes^ the
Calcutta correspondent of the Daily Mail as
saying: "While the official statement that no
alarm is felt concerning Afghanistan is quite true, I
have good reason to believe the Indian Government
has received disquieting information regarding Rus
sian movements in the direction of Persia. Russia is
taking advantage of the Transvaal trouble to
strengthen her armaments and push forward her out
posts along the Persian frontier with a view to ulti
mate annexation, a design in which. Germany would
probably acquiesce in consideration of receiving rail
way concessions."
It is inevitable that the British should feel some
alarm about the situation in India. For more than
thirty years Russia has been pushing Her way south
ward across Asia. It has frequently been asserted that
after the completion of the trans-Caspian railroad a
Russian invasion of India would be practicable when
ever the British force of white troops available for
defense was materially weakened by reason of a war
elsewhere. That time has now come. The British
have employment in South Africa for about every sol
dier thej- can spare, and, if there were no other factors
i:i the problem, Russia would have her long-desired
opportunity for the invasion of India.
The new factor in the problem is Germany. A Ger
man syndicate has recently obtained from the Sultan
of Turkey a concession to build a railroad from some
point on the Bosphorus across Asia Minor, through
the Euphrates Valley to Bagdad, and thence to
the Persian Gulf. That concession is one which has
long been sought by British, Russian and Aus
trian as well as German syndicates. The jealousies of
the?e powers prevented any of them from obtaining
it until the recent treaty between t Great Britain and
Germany opened a way by which the Germans gained
the coveted prize. It is well known the British
granted important railway concessions in Africa dur
ing the recent visit of the Kaiser to England, and it
is probable this Bagdad railway was considered at the
same time.
The Germans are now an aggressively colonizing
people. They have long been engaged in busi
ness in Asia Minor and do a considerable proportion
of the banking and railroading of that country. The
new concession gives them something like a para
mount influence there and offsets the influence here
tofore exercised by Russia. It is clear that by reason
of their interests in the Bagdad railroad the Germans
will be more or less antagonistic to Russian aggres
sions upon Persia, for. as the situation is now, the
Germans have before them an opportunity of becom
ing, hice the Russians and the British, a great Asiatic
power.
The very fact that the British are talking of with
drawing troops from India to strengthen the army in
South Africa confirms the belief that they have a
treaty with Germany which will afford them protec
tion from any attempt on the part of Russia to in
vade India. When Charming found himself forced to
oppose Great Britain to the strength of almost the
whole of Europe, united under the league of the
''Holy Alliance," he supported the United States in
proclaiming the Monroe doctrine, designed to prevent
European powers from attempting to subvert the
South American republics which had just declared
their independence. Upon a memorable occasion he
boasted, "I have called a new world into existence to
redress the balance of the old." The present states
men of Great Britain have done something of a simi
lar kind. They have called a new power into Asia to
redress the balance there. Germany in Asia Minor
may not always be favorable to Great Britain, but at
the present time she serves British purposes well.
Notable Deaths of the Day
ANOTHER ARGONAUT
GOES TO THE GRAVE
JAMES S. WETHERED. a pioneer
of pioneers and one of the mov
ing spirits of the old vigilance
committee, died Sunday evening
last at his home. 2109 Pacific avenue.
He had been ailing for some time, and
as he had long passed the three-score
and ten mark his end was not unex
pected.
James S. Wethered was born at Bal
timore, Md., March 24. 1524. His an
cestors were among the founders of the
commonwealth of Maryland. When 19
years old young Wethered received his
portion from his father and started
out in the world on his own account.
In 1544 he captained a mule train that
carried trade across the Allegheny
Mountains and on and out in the West
ern wilderness to Santa Fe. His men
had many brushes with the Indians,
but came oft victorious. In 1846- he cap
tained another . train over the same
route, and in 1547 he started for Cali
fornia.
In company with John Finley and
some others he bought and loaded the
clipper ship Rhone Hill and started for
THE LATE JAME3 S. WETHERED
the . Goiaen Gate via Valparaiso and {
Honolulu. At the latter place they stopped thirty days, and San Francis
co was finally reached on August 11, 1545. On his arrival here Mr. Wethered j
went to the Sutter Creek fields and there did remarkably well. He returned to
his old home early in 1549 in the United States ship Lexington, and came back y
again the same" year with another cargo of merchandise. From that time on
he met with the usual ups and downs of commercial life, until he finally re- 4
tired on a competency several years ago. â¢
Mr. "Wethered was a member of tne Assembly in the first Legislature that <
ever met In California, He was a life member of the Pioneers, one of the four
organizers of Monumental Engine Company Xo. 6 and a member of the vig- <
ilance committee. -
In IS6O Mr. TYethered was married to Miss Mary J. TToodworth. daughter
of the author of "The Old Oaken Bucket." The issue of that marriage, four
children, are all living. "Woodworth Wethered. the only son. is a civil en- '

Edwin Henry Landseer, known to fame
as Edwin Landseer, or Sir Edwin Land
seer. for he was knighted in 1550, was born
in London in ISO 2, and lived till he was in
his seventy-second year. But his last
years were mentally clouded. His was the
artistic temperament and he was consti
tutionally prone to attacks of nervous de
pression. These became more freQuent and
Increased In intensity as he grew in age:
and in the end they darkened his mind
almost wholly. Dying in 1573. he was bur

Landseer v.-as of a family of artists. His
father was an eminent engraver and
etcher and a well-known writer upon art.
His brother was an R. A. and for many
years was keeper of the Royal Academy.
His brother was one of the most eminent
engravers England has ever had. An un
cle of his, for whom he was named, was
also an artist of considerable reputation.
And other members of his family were
nartists. His mother was a beautiful wor-
of all the sreat artists of hla day Land
seer was the one whom people knew mast
about and were most able- to appreciate
and enjoy. And as a consequence. of nls
popularity Landseer was prosperous. His
pictures sold well, and In addition he re
ceived handsome royalties from the sal*
of the etchings and engravings made of
them. At his death his estate was that of
a man of ample fortune.
Landseer'a life was wholly that of an
artist. He was not a man of business or
of Interest in anything besides his art.
When ii boy and young man his father
looked after all his affairs. Although he
earned handsome sums of money from
the time he was 16. It was not until ha
was 23 years of age that he relieved hla
father of his care of him. Even after he
set up an establishment on hla own ac
count his pecuniary affairs were managed
for him by others.
In all his life Landseer lived in only two
houses. The first was that of his father.
The other was his own. In St. Johns Wood
road, where he resided nearly fifty years.
Such was the hospitality, the bonhomie,
the entertaining and erljoyable character
of Its owner, this St. Johns Wood house
became the most famous center of art and

an and in her maiden days had sat as a
subject for Sir Joshua Reynolds in some
of his allegorical pictures.
While Landseer was a youth facilities |
for the study of art were few. Laniseer, j
however, needed such facilities but little.
His Instinct and genius for art were dom
inant and unmistakable from the first.
Landseer was perhaps as precocious an
artist as ever lived. When scarcely more
than an infant he drew animals from life.
At 5 years of age he drew animals from !
life well. At 8 years of age he drew them
so Well that his drawings were engraved
and etched and are now described in the
catalogues of his works. At 12 years of
age he was an exhibitor in the Royal
Academy, the youngest exhibitor that In
stitution has ever had. At 13 years of age
he drew pictures which even his maturest
powers scarcely surpassed. One of these
pictures, a dog. "Old Brutus," It was
called, in 1574 sold for Â£630 (13150). At 16
years of age a work of his was sold so
well and to such an eminent connoisseur
of the time that at once he became fa
mous. His paintings exhibited in that year
(ISIS) were critically examined by the
most eminent artists of the day and criti
cally described by the most eminent art
writers. He became the fashion; almost
the rage. At 22 he was awarded a pre
mium of Â£150 (1750) by the British Insti
tution for the Encouragement of Artists.
At 24 he was an A. R. A. and at 28 an R.
A., the very earliest dates, we believe,
that he could be admitted to these honors.
Landseers astonishing success was not
due to instinct and genius alone. In his
early years especially he was such a con
scientious and painstaking student as Ttw
artlsts have been. His one great source
of instruction was nature. His studio
was the open fields, the paddocks, the
parks, the stables, the courtyards, where
horses, cattle, sheep, donkeys. dog 3 and
other animals were best to be found. He
faithfully modeled upon and copied nature
in everything he did. Every pose he gave
to an animai, every expression of passion
or of action, every detail of hide and fur,
of skin, hair and wool, of eyes and teeth,
of hoof and claw, was carefully studied
from the life. Acting upon the sugges
tion of the artist Hayclon. he also studied
anatomy and dissected. Acting also upon
the suggestion and advice of Haydon, he
made a special study of the Elgin marbles,
those wonderful relics of the sculptured
life of Greece when the great Phldlus was
in his prime. Landseer thus became,
with the exception of Hogarth, the first
English artist of outdoor life who based
his art upon fidelity to reality. And he
realized this fidelity by study at first
hand. As Ruskin said: "It was not by
the study of Raphael that Landseer at
tained his eminent success, but by a
healthy love of Scotch terriers."
Sir Edwin Landseer's name is bo Inti
mately associated with the portraiture of
animals that it is scarcely rutfessary to
cay that he was the most enrfnent painter
of animal life that England has known,
and one of the most famous the whole
world has known. There are some rea
sons for this pre-eminence apart from the
artist's surpassing fidelity to nature.
Landseer, like Hogarth, w-as a humorist.
Like Hogarth also he was a story-teller, a
dramatist in art. His pictures, almost
all except his very earliest onÂ«s, always
had some sentiment to express, some in
cident of humor or pathos to narrate.
Like Hogarth, too, but In a very minor
degree Landseer was a satirist. It thus
happens that Landseer's pictures appeal
to the popular taste. The public can ap
preciate them apart from their merit as
works of art. His docs, his horses, hla
deer his sheep, his donkeys, his monkeys,
are almost human in their dramatic char
acterization and expressiveness. He
thus read into their portraitures the pro
clivities and prejudices, the humors and
pasElons, of everyday humanity. And
the artist intends that we shall do this,
and by his Inimitable art enables us to
do so.
There is another element in the parallel
ism of Hogarth and Landseer. Landseer.
like Hogarth, was largely assisted in hlÂ«
fame by the fact that the great public
had opportunity of learning of his art
from engravings and etchings. His father,
as we have said, was an eminent en
graver; his brother Thomas was one of
the most eminent engravers and etchers
of his age. Both of these notable artists
spent much of their time in etching and
engraving for the public copies of their
famous relative's works. Other engravers
and etchers of great reputation were also
proud to bear a part In the reproduction
of hia pictures. It thus turned out that
SIR EDWIN LANDSEER.
from his special genius as an artist. Ha
perhaps of all artists In his time was un
excelled for his manual dexterity, his fa
cility of execution. He was without doubt
the most rapid Â«raftsÂ«man in his' art of
his age. He turned out finished pictures
in the same space of time that other
artists would have taken for merely
sketching them. He accomplished with
single strokes of a broad brush effects
of detail which other artists would have
had laooriously to work In, as it were, la
pencil strokes. Nor was there. In this
facility of execution, which Increased
with his years, that deterioration of ex
actness in drawing and accuracy In finish
which might have been expected, although
there was some deterioration. Besides, he
possessed one faculty which was abso
lutely unique. He could draw two differ
ent pictures, with his right and left hands.
at once, not alternating the strokes, but
making them with pach hand, naturally in
order, as if the hand? belonged to differ
ent persons. This faculty, so far as we
know, has never been equaled.
In social life Landseer was a great fa
vorite. He was always the lion of the
party he happened to be in. His powers
of mimicry were very great and nothing
ever gave an assembled company more
amusement than when Landseer could be
got to imitate the voice and gestures of
some brother artl?t.
Landseer was not ambitious In the ordi
nary sense of the word. Once when begged
by his fellow-artists to stand for the pres
idency of the Royal Academy, the highest
honor in hist profession, he declined ac
ceptance of the dignity, although hl3 elec
tion would have been certain. But he was
without doubt the most popular and tha
most famous British artist of his day.
and at the Paris Exposition of 1*55 was
honored by a jury of experts with the
great gold medal of the exposition, bein?
the only British artist that was 30 hon
ored.
Landseer has been called the artist dis
coverer of the Scottish Highlands. A
great many of his themes arÂ«Â« founded on
Scottish incidents and scenes. When he
was a young man Sir Walter Scott was
one of his most ardent admirers, and It no
doubt is due to Scott that Lnndseer's In
terest m Scottish life and character was
first awitkened. In 1824. when he was In
his twenty-second year. Scott carried him
oft to Abbotsford, where, as the painter
Leslie has told usÂ«. "he made himself very
popular both with the master and mis
tress by painting their doggies for them."
Afterward Scott sent him off with Le3lie
on a tour in the Highlands, and from that
time forward the Highlands were Land
peer's favorite recreation ground and field
of work.
Unlike Scott, however. Landseer was not
a sportsman. This seemed very strange
to those who knew I^andseer only from
his works, for a great many of his pic
tures are concerned with sporting themes.
His interest in the life of the moors and
mountains was wholly that of the artist.
Once when a fine stag came bounding his
way he aÂ«tonished his frillies by excitedly
handine them his gun and saylnar. "Here,
take this quick." Instead of killing tha
noble animal, he made a sketch of It. It
was Just this dominant passion for his art
that made Landseer the great artist hÂ«
was.

"PEGLEG" MINE
IS NOT A MYTH
Evidence That It Exists
in the Bad Lands.
Special Klppatch to The Call
SAN* DIEGO. Jan. 15. â It seems that the
mysterious "Pegleg" mine has not been
entirely given up as a myth, for though
many prospectors have sought to locate
the scene of the fabulous finds and have
failed In the attempt, there are others
who are willing to endure all sorts of
hardship in searching for the mine .of the
eccentric old cripple. Men still believe
that the mine will be re-located, and there
are those who hope to be the successful
searchers, and that at no distant day.
There is a gentleman residing in San
Diego who knew Pegleg Smith and heard
from his lips the story of his discovery.
Silas Gasklil, who lives at the corner of
Sixteenth and F streets, was a neighbor
of Smith at Weberville. after the latter
claimed he had found his mine. Gasklll's
house was not over 100 yards from the
cabin of Pegleg. In the evenings young
Gasklil would go over and listen to his
neighbor's thrilling tales of his expe
riences as a hunter and a trapper.
Pegleg Smith's deformity was not con
fined to an* absent limb. He had an ever
present appetite, which was inordinately
devoted to the fiery liquid. Silas Gaskill
liked to hear the old hunter's tales as well
as the latter liked the lurid liquor, and
was willing to make a fair exchange by
embellishing his visits with a pint bottle
of Hangtown whisky. This amount was
ample to keep his host's highly colored
yarns spinning for one ordinary evening.
On one of Gaskill's visits Pegleg told of
his trip across the desert when he clalmnd
to have found his <mlne. He said he uld
not follow tho regular road from Yuma,
but struck out at an angle directly to
ward Temecula. He had three burros,
and when he reached the hills on the
western edge of the desert, being In need
of water, he concluded to ascend a hill
and take a look over the surroundings
for signs of "burro drink."
In front of him were three hills. He as
cended the middle one, which was high- r
than the other two. On the summit he
halted to see if ho could discover a can
yon that looked as If It had water. The
top of the hill was covered with black
rocks and pebbles. He picked up some of
the pebbles and was astonished at their
weight. They were covered with a black
rustlike coating. He dropped them into
his shot pouch and continued his search
for water. Discovering signs of water In
a canyon, he went hnck to his train and
thought no more about his find.
Rome time after reaching his destina
tion. Smith was cleaning out his shot
pouch and came across the black pebbles
found on the hill. Their weight again
aroused his curiosity. He placed one of
them between his teeth and Dlt off a piece
of the rust and found he hnd a nugget
of almost pure, gold.
Mr. Gasklil vouches for the truth of the
nuggets being in the possession of old
Pegleg. He personally saw and handled
them. He is furthermore satisfied that
.the mysterious mine is a 1a 1 reality, and that
It i 3 "situated somewhere in the "bad
lands," which lie directly on the route
Pegleg must have taken. The reason, he

jr ' ROW last evening over drinks In
A Charles Joyce's saloon and grocery
/ 1 on Castro and Seventeenth streets
/ I cost Joyce his life and Thomas Dll
"*Â¦ Â¦*Â¦ lon, a retired police officer, his lib
erty. Joyce died of his wounds on the
operating table in the City and County
Hospital and Dillon, probably fatally
wounded, is under arrest in the Receiv
ing Hospital.
The row started late yesterday after
noon. Dillon had been drinking heavily
and had entered Joyce's saloon about half
past 3 o'clock. Joseph Reedy, Charles Tay
lor, James Downey, Herman Ryforge and
P. Haynes were In the saloon at different
times, and they all say Dillon was drunk
and very quarrelsome. He finally got into
an argument with Joyce over the pay
ment, for a round of drinks. Joyce told
him to drop the matter, to get out and not
to return. One word followed another,
Joyce finally going to the place where
Dillon had left his hat and handing it to
him told him to go. Dillon retorted an
grily and drew a revolver. Joyce jumped
behind the counter and brought his own
weapon to boar, both commencing to
shoot.
In all seven shots were fired. Joyce
went down soon after the first shot. As
he did so he called to Dillon, "For God's
sake, Tom, don't shoot."
- Reedy says Dillon then went up to the
proptrate man and fired at him again.
As Reedy ran up the street in search of a
policeman he heard another shot.
When the police arrived Joyce was
found unconscious, lying behind his coun
ter. Patrolman R. F. Graham took him
to the ambulance at once and hurried him
over to the City and County Hospital,
where he died juat as he was placed on [
the operating table. Joyce was shot twice !
through the abdomen and once through
the arm.
In the meantime Sergeant Shaw and
Patrolman J. A. Fitzgerald hunted up
Dillon, whom they found in a neighboring
saloon. Shaw placed him under arrest
and took him in a buggy to the County
Hospital. ' Dillon was shot once in the
face, the bullet passing through his nose
and lodging In his mouth, whence he
spat it out recovering it and putting it in
his pocket. Another bullet had struck
his head, inflicting a scalp wound. His re
volver had five chambers discharged, and
Joyce's had three, one of which was an
old shot. s'.ii
While the quarrel over drinks was the
direct cause of the shooting, there has
been bad blood between the two men since
September last, when, on complaint of
Joyce. Dillon was haled before the Com
missioners on a charge of drunkenness.
The charges were made by Captain Gillin
upon the report of Sergeant Perrin, but it
was upon information furnished by Joyce
that they were made, and Dillon knew
this. He lives at 4084 Seventeenth street,
close to Joyce's place, and was a frequent
visitor "there. The two men have often
had high words over their differences, but
the ouarrel never assumed anything like
a serious aspect unless Dillon was drUnk,
and even then no one ever suspected it
would en 4 in murder.
Dillon was retired by the old Police
Commission just before it went out of of
fice at the beginning of this year and was
placed on the pension list. He had been
on the force for twenty-one years, and
was known as a good officer, with only
one fallingâ drink. He was four times be
fore the Commissioners within a year and
a half after his appointment, but since
then he settled down and gave no further
trouble until last September, w.^;
Joyce lived with hi? wife and daughter
over the grocery. Dillon lived Just up the
street. He Is a widower with a son and a
daughter, both grown.
As soon as .Dillon's wound was dressed
at the County Hospital he was taken to
the Receiving Hospital, where he could be
keptN under guard. His life hangs on a
slender thread.
thinks, no one has yet been able to find
the mine is that all who have gone in
search of it have looked for the ordi
nary indications of gold, which he is sat
isfied are entirely absent.
Tho description Mr. Gasklll gives of the
location of the mine as given him by
Smith is borne out in every respect by
an Indian who lives at Mesa Grande.
When a boy this Indian was over in the
"bad lands" In company with his father.
They also picket! up some pieces of black
coatt-d metal, which they afterward
learned were nuggets of gold. A few
months ago tho Indian made an attempt
to tlnd the place to which he had been
with his father. He did not find the iden
tical spot, but was in the neighborhood
of it. and brought back a very rich
chunk of ore bearing the black covering.

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Jan. 15.â Except where a stock
Â»-as under the influence of particular causes,
the market to-day v.-as almost at a standstill.
No outside intereFt vu manifested, and oper
ations were entirely in the nature of profes
eional and room traders. Individual causes
Â¦which affected special stocks were for the most
part depressing ones, and the sympathy with
the general market was toward lower prices.
The most conspicuous movement in the day was
Metropolitan Street Railway stock, which was
affected by the published discussion of the con
dition of a prominent trust company. This pub
lication served to explain laet week's depres
sion in Metre politan and a croup of Indus
trlalf. and served also to renew It. Metropol
itan. Brooklyn Transit and the Tobacco
clocks were ail affected. Metropolitan fell
en extreme 6^Â». Announcement of the bid
ders for the New York Rapid Transit tunnel
contract rallied the stock slightly above last
night's level, on the belief that Metropolitan
Interests were concerned in the bidding. An
example of the kind of motives that influenced
trading vres assigned for the buying of Sugar.
One of the large selling orders came from a
brokerage houÂ«e which handles money loans for
the American Sugar Company. The traders ar
Â»Â¦â¢â¢â¢*. that open tilling by insiders indicated a
desire to induce selling by others, upon which
eaj>ient conclusion they bought Sugar.
London reemed to take a cheerful view of the
military developments in South Africa, but very
little effect was noticeable in this market. Re
ports of a strike depressed American Steel and
V ire and some other metal stocks by eyyilÂ»athy.
The money market continued to work easier un
der the influence of continued gains from the
interior and from the Sub-Treasury- Time
xnoney was readily obtainable at 5 per cent on
call. The Sncrease in the supply of loanable
funds seems to offer na incitement to the spec
ulation. Last week's sales were 2.684,075 shares.
In the corresponding week of last year there
vâ¢ '- sold (.455.034 Hhares. Last week's sales
of railroad bonde were on a par value of $5,563.
(â¢â¢o. In the corresjxmdir.g week of last year
they were of a par value of $32,343,000. But. as
It is aptly observed, eacy money does not neces
sarily mear. easy borrowing. Money lenders
and capitalists, an well as speculators. Buffered
from the collapse in values In the December
â¢mash, and there are many securities upon
*hlch no loans cÂ«n be negotiated.
The prevalent dullness of speculation may be
attributed to that wisdom which even the burnt
child is proverbially said to obtain by experi
ence.
There were some heavy individual transac
tions in bonds, and the market was firm; but
there were sufficient declines to give It an ir
retrular ai-r>ea ranee. Total Â«ales. par value,
11.611.000. United States 5s registered and 4s
registered SLdvunrrd 4 in the bid price.

THE STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 15.â Liquidation ruled in the
wheat pit throughout a session which brought
nothing but gloom for such bull hopes as may
have survived recent reverses. There was not
much demand for puts. Throughout there was
selling of long wheat and of lesser lines, not
large In volume, but too heavy for the invalid
market. Trading was dull and the tone heavy
as lead. The early news showed a decline at
Liverpool, an Increase In world's shipments
and in the amount on passage. May wheat
thus influenced opened %c to 4c under Satur
day, at 67>ifj67*ic. This was the high point for
the day. The close waa at the bottom. May lc
under Saturday, at 66% c, later news being as
bearish In tone aa that received earlier. Re
ceipts were larKe and clearances good.
Sympathy with wheat combined with heavy
receipts resulted In a heavy loss in corn. May
close<l 4c to 14c down.
In oats the feeling was easier, the volume of
business small and the demand scattered. May
closed 4c deuresped. at 23TÂ»c.
The provision market, after exhibiting some
tendency to weaken, turned strong and closed
firm at an advance. The demand was good,
some of It from exporting people, and holders
were chary about selling at reduced figures,
in consequence of which the market held
steady. Late In the session an influential con
cern purchased 150.000 tierces of lard. On the
strength of this the whole list went up. May
pork closed 74c to 10c over Saturday. May lard
74c up and May ribs 24c to 5c Improved.

"Tho Idol's Eye," Smith & Herbert's
brilliant comic opera, in which Frank
Daniels scored a big hit in the. city ?ome
time ago, is on this week at the Tivoll.
The Initial performance drew a crowded
house laÂ«t evening. The singing of
Frances Graham, as the chief priestess of
the Ruby, was the feature of the play.
Miss Graham ia the daughter of the late
General Graham, a firm friend of Gen
eral Shatter, and the fact that she was
billed In the cast caused General Shaf tt.r
to occupy a front seat among I the first
nlghters. â¢
Chutes.
"Major Mite told in song at the Chutes
last night how a colored lady said "You
Don't Weigh No Fifteen Hundred
Pounds." The audience was delighted.
The Leandor Brothers, "gladiatorial acro
bats," gave a pretty posturing perform
ance. Harry de Lalne, high barytone,
fave a clever imitation of Fougere, and
'rank Hall, the English lion tamer, put
Wallace through his unwilling paces. The
rest of the bill waa entertaining.

Frank Coffin, on. his debut in vaudeville
was greeted with several theater parties
and applause galore for the three encores
which his friends bestowed upon him. He
made a good impression - and improved
after his first ballad, the excessive vibrato
of which was probably xiue to stage
fright.. The other new people this week
are clever. Hanson and Nelson, the sing

themselves as .favorites. Mile. Emmy's

MARYSVILLE, Jan. 15.â The particu

at Swedes Flat, near' Bangor, on Sunday
have reached this city. It appears that
Henry Dv Voir, the victim, was addicted
to drink, and yesterday while crazed from
the effects of overindulgence went to the
cabin of his friend, Fowler Blnney.
Though he created quite a disturbance on
the outside Blnney permitted him to en

finally persuaded Dv Volr to He on the
bed. The drunken man fell into a doze,
but in a short time Jumped to his feet and
grasped a rifle which stood near the bed.
With a wild cry and an oath he informed
Blnney that he was going to kill him. "As

TO PASS THE

TEST RULES
Board of Education
Favors Plan.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 15.
The resolution of the Board of Health
recommending that all teachers and pu
pils suffering from tuberculosis be ex
cluded from the public schoolÃ came up
before the Board of Education to-night. It
was referred to the committee of the
whole, but there Is no doubt that It
will pass. The only question which will
be considered is the proper shape in which
the measure should be placed that it may
stand a legal test. The following state
ments from members of the Board of Kdu
catlon show that it will be adopted:
President John Russâ The resolution
should be passed. It should be changed,
however, so as not to exclude pupils who
have pulmonary troubles that are curable.
Director Giles H. Grayâ The resolution
is all right. â¢ j|
Director C. H. Redlngtonâ All sufferers
from tuberculosis should be excluded from
the schools. The measure should be
adopted.
Director J. W. Wilcoxâ lt Is a move
which Is In the right direction, and I shall
vote for it. Â¦ . _. .
Director George Randolphâ The ;uca Is
correct, but the resolution needs revision
in some minor respects before it Is
W. G. Mengeeâ The resolution la all rlgnt
and Bhould become a school law.
Director H. A. Powellâ While I consider
the matter all right I want to look into
the legal aspects of it more fully before
expressing an opinion. If it can he parsed
with a certainty that It. will stand a Judi
cial test, I shall certainly vote for it.
Director Myra Knox-The resolution s a
good one and I shall vote for Its adoption.
Director C. B. Rutherfordâ l am not
quite certain as to the legal status of the
matter.. The resolution Is a good one,
however, and should be adopted.

tance. The part of Leontes is .one of op
portunity, but of no very great difficulty.
It is a well-built and clearly defined char
acter that fits itself In the lines of the
play. Mr. Hanford does not spoil It,
though ho Is inclined to overact and at
one point In the fourth act he rants out
rageously. In the final scenes he is ad
mirable In his reserve and depicts the
tenderness of the contrite king with judg
ment and good effect.
Mr. James as Autolycus has little more
than a glimmering trace of merit. He is
sacrificed In the part and makes matters
worse by. his variously false conception.
He destroys, the wit of the role and falls
to bring out tho knavery, slyness and
pedantry that are Its chief distinctions.
PORTER GARNETT.
Alhambra.
Those who went to the Alhambra last
evening to be amused went away satis
fied. This was also experience of the
attendance' on Sunday, when "A Hot Old
Time" was opened for the first time after
a long absence from "this city. In the
present presentation of the piece there
are many new features which vastly Im
prove It. It will be remembered that this
is a comedy without a plot and without
any special point that can be perceived,
but for all that the audience was kept in
a constant fit of laughter, the comical
situations springing spontaneously into
view.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar stock company surprised
the patrons of that theater with the
splendid manner in which it presented
"Lady Windermere's Fan" last evening
Of course,- there were weak spots In the
play A but taken as a whole It was one of
the best performances seen at thia house
Grand Opera-House.
j Theflrst production in this city of Dellin
ger's comic opera, "Don Caesar of Irun "
at. the i Grand Opera-house last night
scored an instantaneous and emphatic hit.
The music is of a high order and tuneful
and full justice was done to the various
numbers by .the capable company. The
choruses were especially effective, and the
orchestra was more than equal to the de
mands of .the openu^,
Olympia.
Zoyarra. the , ball manipulator. Is still
pedaling. his way into favor at'the Olym
pla, and the La Monts retain their popu
larity. The whole bill rendered last night
was good.
Mary Van Buren in all her wide-eyed
and dimpled beauty did much to give
charm to the performance. She waa given
her first real chance and easily carried
off the honors. The opportunity wm all
that Daly could make it, whose propensity
for giving Ada Rehan more than her
share of prominence Is well known. The
part of the Countess Is big enough to sat
isfy any actress with enough good looks
and talent to warrant a nearly continuous
display of the same, and certainly Miss
Van Buren has a plethora of the first and
more than a modicum of the latter.
She is on the stage almost all the time,
and quite aside from such entertainment
as Is offered by the play and the playing
of It, there is a great deal of enjoyment
to be had in the mere contemplation of
her glorious pulchritude. There is' some
variety to her part, though it is cast on
the lines of straight comedy, and so far
as the acting goes she is adequate to the
requirements. She has not that subtle
coquetry that is characteristic of Ada
Rehan, and in her byplay there Is a no
ticeable effort to be doing something,,
sometimes without the happiest results.
In extenuation of her lack of finesse It
may be said that many handicaps arise
from the exigencies of stock company
work, and a careful and artistic charac
terization may not be compassed by
meager rehearsing nor brought to a state
of completion for a first performance. â¢
"The Winter's Tale" is Kathryn Kld
der*B play. In the roles of Hermione and
Perdita at the Columbia last night she
carried the burden of the acting on her
fair shoulders and captured her audience
unconditionally. She was preferable as
Hermione for many reasons, but chiefly
for her intelligent reading of serious lines.
Her enunciation Is well defined and her
accent and emphasis, judicious. In the
part of Hermione, where a certain degree
of force, of spell, Is essential she Is not
wanting and it is only when she doffs
her more sombre habit and appears as
Perdita, decked with roses and filled with
the ecstacy of youth, that, as an actress,
we find her wanting. Even then she has
charm and is fair to look upon, but, de
spite her abundant epirit, she fails to be
truly girlish and, with her Hermione fresh
In memory, one is almost compelled to
think that she is untrue to herself in es
saying a role that fits her less well than
that.
In Charles Hanford the so-called "tri
umvirate" has an actor of some lmpor-
Occasionally, when the luck changed,
the Berkeley troubadors were enabled to
Indulge In the luxury of a ride In one of
the beautifully upholstered second-class
Collis P. Huntington coaches, along with
long-queued hatchetmen, unwashable In

the kindness of freight brakemen. they
managed to woo Morpheus while rolling
along the railroad right-of-way, snugly
ensconced in Pullman Bide-door sleepers â
otherwise known as boxcars.
The deficit the club sustained while on
the trip amounts to over $900. Some of
the members are now seriously thinking
of changing the association to a 'pedes
trian club. *
ent all comes from the annual winter
tour which the club took. Concerts were
given in various places along a route be
tween Southern California and the State
of Washingtonâ and the walking was bad
everywhere. Toward the latter end of
the trip stern-hearted and practical hotel
keepers silently pointed to the printed
rule which hangs on the wall of every
hostelry where theatrical talent Is wont
to domicile itself and as a result the
principal dishes on the Glee Club menu
were crackers, cheese cheese and crack
ers. . i
They couldn't get around the dictum of
the landlords which reads: "All guests
without baggage are required to pay in
advance."
OAKLAND. Jan. 15.â The Glee Club
of the University of California Is
now possessed of a glumness which
belies the suggestion of happiness
which its title conveys. The members are
anything but Joyful. Gloom follows In
the wake of them like a nemesis stalking
behind a victim. No longer does the
sound of their voices float through the
atmosphere In a gladsome manner to the
tune of a rag-time accompaniment. In-
Etead their vocal efforts appear sad and
dreary and the instrumental music which
goes with their songs, resembles the dirges
played at the funeral of a Digger Indian.

the aggregation of collegiate musical tal-
BOARD OF HEALTH HANDS
OUT MORE APPOINTMENTS
DR. CHALMERS MADE CHIEF
SANITARY INSPECTOR.
Given Ten Assistants, and Other
Plums Are Distributed With
a Free Hand.
The Board of Health fixed up another
bunch of appointments In one of its dark
lantern sessions last night, and after the

C A. BothÂ©, Dr. li. B. Graham. Dr. Frank
T. Fltxglbbon, Dr. A. 8. Keenan. Dr. John
Green and Dr. C. L. Pawlicki. As the nn
ttnclal ptringency under which the board
Is laboring necessitates the exercise of a
certain measure of economy, it was or
dered that the sanitary Inspectors serve
alternately, half one month and half the
next month until further notice.
Nine matronships were created, the sal
ary in each case being fixed at $60 a
month. The positions were filled by the
appointment of the following: Mrs. Annie

GENERAL HART SUED
FOR HEAVY DAMAGES
OAKLAND, Jan. 15.â General William
H. 11. Hart of San Francisco Is named
as defendant' in a damage suit filed in
the Superior Court of Alameda County
late this afternoon, wherein Mrs. Ella R.
Senecal, also a resident of the metropolis,
appears as plaintiff.
Tho basis of Mrs. Senecal's action la
the alleged tardiness of the well-known
attorney In his undertaking to recover
moneys on a judgment rendered In her
favor against certain prominent people
on a promissory note over a year ago.
The complaint, preferred by Attorney
Arnold W. Liechti, recites: ".That on De
cember 7. 1597. In an action of Mrs. Ella
R. Senecal against N. W. Spauldlng, J. S.
Emery and Abner Doble, in the Superior
Court of Alameda County, plaintiff was
given judgment against defendants In the
sum of $3161 55 and $11 55 for costs of court.
"That in December. 1837. plaintiff em
ployed and retained defendant, \V, H. H.
Hart, who undertook and agreed Imme
diately to set on foot and prosecute in a
proper nml diligent manner, as attorney,
such proceedings as are by law In such
cases made and provided.
"That If Attorney Hart had so done
he might have enforced payment on said
Judgments before December 1. IS3B.
â¢ * â¢ But that defendant has absolute
ly failed to do so, and that in the mean
while N. W. Spaulding, J. S. Emery and
Abner Doble have Decome insolvent:

unsatisfied."
Mrs. Senecal prays for Judgment against
Defendant Hart In the sum of $3161 55.

A FEW of the Frawleys were seen in
"The Countess Guckl" at the Cali
fornia Sunday night. It is a far
cry from Pinero to Yon Schoenthan, who,
so the programme has it, Is the author of
the latter play. If, however, the Teuton
have no other claim to distinction than
this one it 13 not to be wondered that his
name is not known to fame. I do not
know what the farce may have amounted
to before It was Rehanlzcd by Augustln
Daly, or whether that process were fruit
ful of good or 111 to the original, but aside
from being occasionally humorous, fre
quently Filly and always conventional,
"The Countess Gucki" Is not marked by
anything that will make it remembered.
Considering the poorness of the material
It has to work with, the company docs
very well, and it is its very fair aver
age work that alone saves the show from
being tedious. "The Countess Guckl" in
worse hands would be banal; in better
hands It might. In spite of its shortcom
ings, admit of occasional brilliancy, and
in the hands of the Frawley company It
Is moderately entertaining without being
either glaringly good or sensationally bad.

wedding ceremony was performed in
Pearson's office at 522 Montgomery street,
San Francisco. A Sausallto Justice of
the Peace officiated.
Miss Leen had been engaged to Pearson
for some time, but the engagement Was
kept a profound secret, only one or two
close friends being aware of it. It is said
that Pearson feared possible objections
on the part of his daughter, MrÃ. Dr. W.
8. Porter of Oakland.
Although the wedding day had not been
definitely. set, there was an understanding
between Miss Leen and Pearson that it
was to take place at any time between
Friday of last week and Thursday " of
this, presumably when Pearson became
satisfied the coast was clear. It was at
first planned that the bridal party should
hire a tugboat and have the wedding at
eea, in that way avoiding the necessity of
procuring a marriage license and thereby
attracting attention. This plan was after
ward abandoned, and It was agreed that
Pearson's office should be the scene of the
wedding.
Miss Leen was In momentary expecta
tion of a summons. She was kept, no her
friends say, ai the highest pitch of sus
pense. At 3 o'clock Saturday afternoon
the message she anticipated arrived. At
4 o'clock she was on her way to San Fran
cisco, having made hurried preparations.
At 5 o'clock she arrived in the city, where
she was met at the ferry by the prospec
tive groom. At 6 o'clock she stood with
Pearson before the Sausallto Justice, vow
ing to love, cherish and obey for keeps.
When the ceremony was concluded the
bridal party hied to a fashionable rotls
serle, where a wedding supper was en
joyea. Mr. and Mrs. Pearson will leave
in a few days for an extended European
tour.
Miss Leen that was has made her home
for the past five years with Mrs. W. M.
Calcutt of 2157 Clinton avenue. She has
been engaged in newspaper work in San
Francisco at times and Is quite an accom
plished musician. ' Her age is given as 26
years.
Pearson Is a well-known mining nan
and has had an eventful career. At one
time he was associated with Senator
Hearst In mining deals. He was a
widower and is 49 years of age.
Pearson once before attracted attention
to himself In Alameda through his con
nection with the Long Branch baths,
which he built, and the street car line
connecting Alameda with Oakland, in
which he was a stockholder. He and Thnd
Fitch, also interested, went one morning
to the stables of the car line and took
forcible possession of the rolling stock,
their object being to control Its operation.
The courts were resorted to, however, by
the other (stockholders, and the property
was restored to them.
ANGLUS MAY BE SUFFERING
FOR HIS SISTER'S CRIME
John Soares So Declared in What He Believed to Be His
Dying Statement.
: - t
Tie Aged Man, in the Fear of Death, Deposed That It Was the Girl and Hot
Her Brother Who Put a Bullet Into Him.
"I, John Rogers Soares, being afraid and thinking I am going to
die as the result of being shot this evening, declare that I was shot by
Annie Anglus.
' "Joseph Anglus told me that his sister Filomena Anglus wanted
to see me and to go there this evening.
"I went and when near there the sister Annie told me to go in
side the gate to where she was, which was on the porch, and when I
said I would not go any nearer Annie Anglus told me she wanted to
see me.
"I then said: 'I don't want to see you. It was your sister I wanted
to see.' She said, 'I am Filomena.' As I got near her I. told her that she
was not Filomena, and at this time Annie Anglus shot me. This state
ment is made by me for the purpose of having the law take its course in
punishing my assailant.

"Notary Public in and for Alameda County, State of California."
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 15.
THIS stateâent, forwarded to-day to
the District Attorney in Oakland,
puts an entirely different aspect
upon the shooting of John Rogers
Soares at Centervllle Wednesday evening
last. It directly charges what many have
suspectedâ that Joseph Anglus, now In
Jail for the shooting of Soares, while sup
posed to have been disguised as his sister
Annie, is suffering for an act committed
by the girl herself.
This has been suspected by many, but
Joseph Anglus has always said that he
was the one who did the shooting while
disguised In his sister's clothing. He still
sticks to his original story, but the dying
statement of Soares is directly contra
dictory.
When the story of the shooting first be
came known it was said by everybody
that one of the Anglus girls had com
mitted the crime. When the Sheriff's rep
resentatives at Centervllle started their
investigation on Thursday, however, they
found the girls denying any direct par
ticipation In the act and the brother as
serting- that he was the one who fired
the shot. The boy told every one how he
had disguised himself In his sister's cloth-
Ing and had tried to avenge an insult
offered her. Upon his own confession he
was placed under arrest and Is still In
the County Jail In Oakland.
While Joe Anglus' story was accepted
there were some around Centervllle,
where all parties are known, who said
that one of the girls and not the boy
had fired the shot. John G. Mattos Jr.,
who represents the District Attorney at
Centervllle, went to the house of Soares
and secured the above dying statement,
from which it would seem that young
Anglus Is submitting: to a trial for an
attempted murder In which he had no
hand. . . -
Despite the revelation made in the dying
statement of Soares the boy still stands
by his original story- When he was
shown the statement to-night in . the
County Jail he said:
"I refuse to say whether it Is true or
not, and I intend to protect my sisters,
no matter whtfu the consequences are. I
expect to get out of this all right, and if I
do old Soares wants to be mighty careful
how he talks about my sisters In the fu
ture."
The dying statement of Soares was
made the day after he was shot, and when
he was expected to die. Since his recov
ery Soares has recanted on everything and
has repudiated what h* thought at the
time of the tragedy was his dying utter
ances.
Soares now asserts in a most positive
manner that he does not know who held
the revolver which sent a bullet caroming
around one of his right ribs. For that
reason, he says, he does not want to urge
the prosecution against Joseph Anglus,
the young brother of the girl who was
originally accused, nor does he deslra to
set the wheels of justice In motion against
any person.
â¢The two sisters are still at Centervllle.
They have both declared that It was their
brother who fired the shot, but with their
knowledge. They refuse .to discuss the
new phase of the case.
"I have had my revenge, that's all," An
nie Anglua vehemently declared when
questioned. "Old Soares is a scoundrsl,
and I am sorry he was not killed."
"Who shot him?" was asked.
"None of your business," was the terse
reply. .
The question Is, whether young Anglua
is suffering imprisonment and is ready t^
face possible conviction for the sake of
his sister.

BLOODY BUTTLE

LAWLESS TONGS
Another Chinese Shot
to Death.
MURDERED IN A THEATER
TWO BULLETS FIBED INTO HIS
BODY.
Gee Ah Woy, a member of the Hop
Bine long of highbinders, 'was shot and
ki'.lfd Jahl night in the Jackson-street
theater.
The murdered Chinaman was seated In
the rear of the theater when he was /shot
ir^Ti l-f-hind. two bullets entering his
bark, causing his death a short time
:. ': :w axd. As usual, the assassin made
gtto i W* escape.
Woy entered the theater shortly before
t a'dock, accompanied by another China
man. A ffw minutes later a gang of
liignWnders of tht Suey Sing tong walked
Into the place and sat on the top of the
Ivncfaea l>ehiud their victim.
While the attention of the audience was
centered on the villain in the play one of
the hijrhbinders drew a 44 Colt's revolver
aaA fired two shot** into the back of the
uj;tus"i*Â«>ctlng Ch,inan:an. The murderer
and his fellow highbinders at once rushed
:<t ihe door of wie theater, and brushing
asidt- ih- two white ticket-takers, escaped
in the excitement. One of them was fol
lowÂ«d to Sacramento and Montgomery
greets, where he was arrested. It is not
l>el!eved that he is the man who did the
shooting. The pistol which the murderer
used was found on the bench which was
occupied by the highbinders. As the
wounded Chinaman snowed signs of life
he was placed in the patrol wagon and
hurrdiedly dri\en to the Harbor Hospital.
Despite the efforts of the surgeons he
Lreathed his last a short time atterward.
The shooting did not seem to have any
effect on the actor*. They continued to
play their r>ar tf Just as if nothing had
happened. Even the villain in the play
temporarily abandoned his lines to do a
sort of cakewalk.
The murder, the police say. was the re
sult of an attempt by three Hop Sing
highbinders to kill a Suey Sing man in St.
Louis alley Sunday night. Their Intended
victim was passing through the alley
when he was attacked by the men, one
vt whom slashed him across the arm with
& long knife.
The wounded Chinaman reported the as
sault to the president of his tong, .and
war was at once declared on the Hop Sing
highbinders. It was apreed that the as
sault on one of their members was a
J'.agrant breach of the peaoe treaty, which
was sipr.^d by both tongs a few days ago
and which was intended to prevent fur
ther bloodshed in Chinatown. It is known
that the Suey Sing men held a meeting
shortly before the killing and selected
"\Vriy as their victim.
The polloe are satisfied that a bloody
war is imminent between the rival tones
and they are preparing to prevent it if
possible.
BIGGY TAKES ACTION.
Raids Chinatown at Midnight
and Makes Many Arrests.
Acting Chief of Police BIRRT was much
Incensed when he was informed of the
las=t Chinatown murder last night and as
toon as possible gathered together sixty
officer* and started on, a wholesale raid.
Houses where Chinese Immoral traffic Is
carried on were the llrpt to feel the effect
of the acting Chiefs latest orders. Bigrgy
has declared that they must be closed
and demolished, as they afford the high
binders too Rood a place of concealment
and sUso furnish through blackmail a
#;re.at source of revenue to the hatchet
men.
At 1 o'clock this morning Biggy, with
his pquad of mr-n and three patrol wagons,
entered the Chinese quarter and began
what he declared would- be the roughest
deal ever glvÂ«n to the lawless element in
Chinatown. His intentions were, he said,
to arrest every Chinese woman of ill-fame
In th* quarter and charge her with va
prancy. The situation demanded prompt
m< .'inures, and a stop must be put to the
highbinder and his utter disregard for the
law, was the way Chief Blggy explained
his action, ajid he has declared his inten
tion to make the highbinders behave or to
puffer the consequence. A large number
of arrests were made.
By l o'clock there was a considerable
exodus of Chinese from Chinatown, gangs
of coolies In fear of the officers leaving
the quarter. Acting Chief Biggy made the
declaration that he would not permit the
Chinese celebration of their New Year
holidays under the murderous conditions
prevailing.

Ececlal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 15. â From Honolulu
comes an interesting and heretofore un
published story related there by Captain
Walker of the steamship City of Colum
bia, which recently foundered off Nlihau.
In August, ISSS. the bark Wandering Min
strel, with twenty-eight men, and Captain
Walker commanding, sailed from Hong
kong: After eighteen days the ship was
driven on the reefs of Midway Sand Islands
and wrecked. Landing upon the larger
inland the crew found an old building,
which had been erected thirty years be
fore by a party of United States Govern
ment surveyors, where the hapless sur
vivors were doomed to an exile of four
teen months, subsisting on fish and the
eggs of sea birds that nested in the sands,
until rescued by the Japanese schooner
Norma and conveyed to Hongkong.
It was not until they had been on the
larger island several week 3 that the
smaller island was explored. Lying be
tween the two islands a broken hull bear
ing the name "General Siegel" told the
Â«ilent story of another disaster. Success
fully reaching the second island they
found two mounds of sand, over which
wooden crosses made from driftwood had
been erected and the Inscription . "ISÂ§6"
hacked upon each. A little distance be
yond upon thÂ« pand was the form of a
man lying upon nis back. As they looked
upon him his eyes opened and without the
least apparenl emotion he said "How are
you?" Then he arose and with no-more
apparent concern than if he had had com
panionship constantly told them that he
was the sole survivor of the Siegel and
that the graves were those of the captain
and mate, whom he had buried. For
months this sailor, who said his name was
Jorgensen. remained sullen and silent, de
clining to give the details of the Siegel's
wreck and the death of his companions.
At last he became ill -and expected to
die He then confessed to Captain Walk
er's son that he had murdered the cap
tain and mate because they had treated
him brutally aboard ship. When the
schooner Norma came along and rescued
Walker's crew it was decreed that Jor
gensen should be left there to expiate his
crime.

NEW YORK, Jan. 15.â Commissioner of
Charities Keller to-day dismissed from
the Metropolitan Hospital on Blackweli's
Island twelve physicians who, because of
differences with Superintendent George T.
Stewart of the instituion. 'on Sunday
hanged him In effigy- In the Morgue, usirg
a cadaver for the purpose. Pinned to the
breast of the corpse, which was suspended
from the ceiling by means of a rope, was
a placard bearing an opprobrious refer
ence to the superintendent. Commissioner
Keller, when asked about the matter,
"It was a most disgraceful and' out
rageous affair, and I dismissed every
mother's son of them. When men are
hanged in effigy an artificial thing is gen
erally used, and the use of a cadaver
goes beyond the limits of decency."

LATEST REPORT
FROM LORD ROBERTS
LONDON, Jan. 15.â The War Office has
published the following dispatch from

"French reports that a reconnaissance

PROCEEDING TO THE
RELIEF OF LADYSMITH
CAPE TOWN, Jan. 13.â There is good
reason to believe the statement that Sir
Charles Warren, with 11,000 men, has gone
toward Weenen is correct, and we may
expect important news shortly.
Reports have been received here that
dysentery is very rife Ui Ladysmith.
Everything is phenomenally quiet at
Sterkstroom.
LONDON, Jan. 16.â The Sandard gives
prominence to the following dispatch,
dated Saturday, January 13. from Durban:
"A man who has just arrived here from
Springfield says that a British column
proceeding to the relief of Ladysmith
has crossed the Little Tugela. When he
left it was facing the Boer position on the
Big Tugela. and a howitzer was shelling
the Boer trenches. He says also that 270
wagons laden with commissariat stores
for Ladysmith had left Frere, and it was
expected that the column would join
hands with General White on Monday
evening.
"The traction engines have been doing
excellent work In hauling heavy wagons
out of 4ioles and swamps. This they ac
complish with the greatest ease. British
patrols have discovered parties of Boers
in the direction of Ennersdale, between
Frere and Estcourt."
BOERS BURNED SOME
OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS
LONDON, Jan. 16.â The correspondent
of the Dally Telegraph at PletermarUz
burg, telegraphing Thursday, January' 11,
says:
"The gallantry of the Ladymith garrison
last Saturday appears to have depressed.
If not actually demoralized, the Boers
generally. It is believed they lost at lea^t
two, if not three, killed as against our
one.
"Many Boers are believed to be trekking
northward. The magistrate at Nautu,
Zululand, telegraphs that scouts report
having seen many Boer families with
wagons proceeding north via Zululand.
while a European who formerly resided
at Dundee declares that after the repulse
at Ladysmith a number of Boer wagons,
loaded with dead and wounded, passed
through that mining township, and that
the Boers burned some of the public build-
Ings as they departed. Five days have
passed since then." 'â¢'-Â¦Â¦
KRUGER PREDICTED
THE PRESENT STRIFE
LONDON. Jan. 16.â J. B. Robinson, the
South African millionaire, in a signed ar
ticle in the Daily News this morning re
lates conversations he has had with Pres
ident Kruger, and describes several inter
views in which the Jameson raid was
talked over. On one of these occasions
President Kruger said:
"Do you mean to tell me that you do
not know that the men who organized and
engineered the raid organized it for their
own benefit? They had decided how they
would divide the Transvaal and how each
of the parties was to have certain inter
ests in this country. Many reformers who
were put In jail were perfectly innocent.
They were Ignorant of the schemes of the

twelve men in that inner circle, and they
CARNEGIE PAID TOLLS
ON HOAR'S SPEECH
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 15.â A Washington spe
cial to the Inter Ocean says: Andrew
Carnegie paid the tolls on Senator Hoar's
speech which was cabled to Agulnaldo
and which nerved the Tagalo leader to
rebel against the authority of the United
States. This fact has been known to
President McKinley and his advisers for
months, but for many reasons no action
was taken upon it.
Now that the story of the cabling of
the speech at an expense of $4000 has been
told by ex-Minister Barrett in his Lake
Forest speech and a great of specu
lation is being indulged in as to the
source of the seemingly illimitable funds
of the insurgents, the administration
deems it best to keep the matter no longer
a secret.
It is further said that the American
troops recently captured a lot of Agu
inaldo's papers, among them letters in
criminating a number of prominent Amer
icans of indiscretion at least, if not trea
son. These papers are now on the way
to Washington. What disposition will be
made of them on their arrival has not
been divulged.
KENDRICK STILL SUBMERGED.
MOSCOW, Idaho. Jan. 15.- -The water in
the Big Potlach River Is receding, but a
large part of the town of Kendrick is still
under water. The change of the river
current toward the town is said to be
partly the result of a recent train wreck.
Many tons of steel rails were lost in the
river. This caught the driftwood and
formed a dam which diverted the chan
nel and turned it toward the main street
of Kendrick. The stores will lose thou
sands of dollars in ruined goods, as in
many buildings the water was waist deep.
The tracks of the Northern Pacific Rail
way for miles between Vollmer and
Lewlston are washed out.
Strange as it may seem, one of the
sorest needs of Kendrick is drinking
water, as the water works and wells are
ruined. The water is all muddy and not
fit to use. An engine and passenger
train are on the sidetrack near the depot
and can go neither forward nor backward.
For a long distance the river now runs*
where the railroad was. It will take. In
the opinion of railroad men, three months
to repair the road.

BRUSSELS. Jan. 16.â An Ant
werp paper pretends to have re-
ceived a cipher telegram dated
Pretoria, January 13, announcing
Buller's defeat on that day at
Springfield.
LONDON. Jan. 16.â Complete uncer
tainty prevails here as to what is
taking place in Natalâ an uncer
tainty permeated by apprehen
sion. The situation is likened to
that which existed In Northern
States after the battle of Bull Run. There
is the same dearth of news, the same
dread that worse may yet betide and the
B ame Etern determination that a new dis
aster, should one come, must have a mor
row.
Amid the -multitudinous theories set
forth by critics there is one to which at
tention may be called at the outset. It is,
to pay the least, as good a guess as any
of the other vaticinations that are being
made in every quarter, and it comes from
a man who has had long and close exper
ience of Boers and their character. This
gentleman's suggestion is that the mys
tery that seems to envelop the Boers'
movements may be due to the fact that
they are quietly retiring from Tugela and
other advanced positions toward the
Drakensburg passes, leaving small bodies
behind them to mask their withdrawal.
He cites reputed movements of com
mandos with guns in the neighborhood of
Ladysmith, and confused reports, as to
the abandonment of the Colenso trenches,
in suppport of his theory. In the Drak
ensburg range the passes are naturally
fo strong, and have besides been so well
fortiiicd, that the burghers may well look
upon them as the ancients looked upon
Thermopylae.
With the withdrawal kept secret, the
email bodies left to mask the general re
tirement, unhampered by guns or stores,
would, according to this gentleman, have
a good chance of making their way to a
place of safety when the British advance
made their retreat necessary.
Reports that Colenso and Groblers
Klocf have been abandoned by the Boers
geem now to be open to doubt, as one cor
respondent telegraphs that the Boers are
still :n Colenso, while another quotes
statements that the Boers have mounted
another gun at Groblers Kloof.
The censor is evidently determined that
nothing shall come through from Buller's
army until his movement has been com
pleted, but although there is much that
is dubious and uncertain about the exact
situation in Natal, the feeling is growing
that General Buller's turning movements
are having a real and possibly decisive de
fect.
The facts that seem well assured are
very f^*', but. such as they are, they all
point in the same direction. Buller has
not been heard of since his arrival at
Potgleters Drift, with the enemy four and
a half miles in front of him.
It is said that General Warren has
crossed the Tugelaâ at what point was not
mentionedâ and that some of the British
cavalry are on the north Fide of the river.
The apparent ease with which Buller
made his way westward and crossed the
Little Tugela leads to the natural infer
ence that Springfield was not held by the
contingent of the Boers with guns which
Â¦was reported eeveral days ago to be there.
And if both on their extreme right at
Springfield and* on their extreme left at
Klangwand and Inhlawe Mountains the
Boers were discovered to have vacated
their Ftrong positions, it follows that their
line, because of Its extension over twenty
miles, was too weak and that prudence
dictated concentration, probably near
Onderbrook Spruit, between Ladysmith
and Colenso.
Simultaneously menaced on the east
and west, they must do one of two things,
collect their forces behind very strong
Intrenchments. where they must be dis
lodged by assault before Ladysmith can
be relieved, or else Joubert is retreating
from Colenso and east and will fall upon
Buller's column with his whole strength,
hoping to crush him before assistance can
arrive from Warren.
This second alternative seems much
more plausible, for It accounts for the
rapid removal of Boer commandos from
the Immediate neighborhood of the river.
A jrood road runs northwest from Bulwer
bridge toward Roodepoort and Dewdrop,
past Ondcrbrook Spruit. If the Boers
availed themselves of this route they
would interest Buller on the march from
Potgicters Drift northward and compel
him to accept battle.
If these suppositions are even approxi
mately correct there must be some heavy
lighting going on northwest of Colenso
and close to Dewdrop. of which we may
receive news at any moment.
From Ladysmith there is another con
siderable list of deaths by disease, show-
Ing that the garrison is suffering under
the strain of the Fiege.
To what extent White's command will
be able to co-operate with the relief col
umn is uncertain. The men must be ex
hauftttd and horses out of condition. They
cannot be good for much until they have
had some weeks of rest. Thus their
nominal strength of S5OO men and sixty
runs does not represent their true fighting
force.
A dispatch received this â¢ morning
through on agency contains the strange
statement that ten trainloads of mounted
men had been sent back to Durban by
General Buller. They took the train
Saturday for the mouth of the Tugela
River, and It is said they are to march
through Zululand. There is no corrobora
tion of this dispatch, and it is hard to see
why a large body of such men as are
now most needed at the front should be
cent at this time to make so long a march.
From other regions of the war there is
little important news. General Wood
has established himself at Zoutpans Drift,
well within the Orange Free State.
General French is still working around
Colesberg. He has mounted a big gun
en an almost inaccessible hill north of the
ers Kop were driven out by the British
faaturday. Commandant Nel, on the west
of the town, and the Pretoria commando
on the north have taken the kopjes com
manding Caesars Camp, from whic they
maintain a continuous sniping of the
British. The Pretoria commando lost six
men .killed and six wounded in attempting
to storm the fort.
WORRYING THE BOERS.
LONDON, Jan. 15.â 1t is said dispatches
have been received from Colesberg, da*ed
Friday, January 12. saying Colonel Por
ter, with the ' mounted -' New Zealanders
and the New South Wales lancers, were
worrying the Boers from kopje to kopje
by plucky, hazardous moves. The colo
nials, it is added, were completely non
plusing the burghers. A party of Rem
ington scouts, eluding the Boer pickets,
entered Norvals Pont and secured val
uable information.
GARRINGTON ORDERED SOUTH.
LONDON, Jan. 15.â Major General Sir
Frederick Garrington. the well-known
South African officer, until now com

MACRUM ON WAY HOME.
PORT SAID, Jan. 15.â Charles E. Ma
crum, formerly United States Consul at
Pretoria, left here on board the steamer
"Koenig to-day for Naples, on his way

WEAPONS ON BUNDESBATH.
BERLIN, Jan. 15.â The belief here is
that the weapons found aboard the Bun
desrath are those described on the ship's
papers as two cases of fowling pieces.
seph Chamberlain, says: "We under
stand on tho highest authority that If the
Government is defeated in Parliament on
the question of the war the Cabinet will
immediately appeal to the country, all the
Ministers having decided to stand to

Minister to be made a scapegoat." â¢ .

ALL BURGHERS ARE
ORDERED TO THE FRONT

LONDON, Jan. 16.â The special corre
spondent of the Daily Mail sends this dis
patch:
LOURENZO MARQUEZ, Saturday,
Jan. 13.â President Kruger has Issued a
proclamation ordering all burghers to the
front. The Volkssten suggests! that im
mediately the British cross the border, the
gold industry should be irretrievably de
stroyed. President Kruger has also issued
a circular dated January 8 to Boer gen
erals, commandants and burghers, urging
that they should show more energy in the
Transvaal cause.
FREE STATE CALLS
OUT ALL AVAILABLE MEN
LONDON. Jan. 16.â The Times corre
spondent at Lourenzo Marquez, telegraph
ing last Saturday, says:
"The Free State has now called out
every available man. including the leading
merchants, who had expected to enjoy
Immunity. The Volkssten, in the course
of an article obviously inspired, indicates
the gold tax as a political move, holding
that if the assumption be correct that the
bulk of Rand shares is held on the Conti
nent, Germany, France and other coun
tries must recognize the desirability of
bringing the war to a speedy close. It
adds that every day the war continues
costs the shareholders Â£17,000. A threat
of confiscation will be used to enforce the
tax.
"With the invaluable assistance of a
considerable number of British subjects,
the Boer Government is steadily increas
ing the yield from the mines, thus secur
ing funds to pay foreigners employed in
the manufacture of explosives, shells and
other agents for the prosecution of the
war. The time must come when the Im
perial Government will proclaim that such
British subjects will be prosecuted for
treason or deprived of British citizenship.
"The Boer Government is feeding 14,000
British subjects. I am informed that the
Portuguese customs officials recently
seized three cases of contraband contain
ing field signaling appliances consigned by
a French firm."
PRESBYTERIANS IN
FAVOR OF "CIVILIZATION"
CHICAGO. Jan. 15.â At the regular
weekly meeting of the Presbyterian min
isters of Chicago to-day Rev. Arthur J.
Brown, D. D., of New York, secretary of
the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Mis
sions, made an address in which he took
strong grounds against the Boers and in
favor of the British in their present con
flict for supremacy in South Africa.
"I am in favor of England in her fight
in Africa because I know she will carry
the spirit of humanity with her," Bald Dr.
Brown. "There Is always a breath of civ
ilization following the British flag."
The speaker also spoke in favor of re
taining the Philippines, "for the sake of
civilization and the spirit of religion."
Following his remarks upon England in
Africa, Dr. Brown commented on the in
ternational complications in Asia and said:
"It is in Asia that England's real power
will be found. . With the menacing atti
tude of France and Russia, England must
look well or she will be forced to war
with these nations. But her hand will
spread the word of God, and therefore we
should look with favor upon her."
Dr. Brown's remarks caused consider
able comment among the clergymen pres

BROKER BADLY
BEATEN ON 'CHANGE
LONDON, Jan. 15.â A disgraceful scene
occurred on the Stock Exchange to-day.
When Maurice Herzfelder of the big stock
brokerage firm of Kahn & Herzfelder, do-
were to divide the- Transvaal among
themselves.
"They and their companies found the
money for the raid. Do you think we are
so innocent not to know that Rhodes,
metaphorically speaking, held a pistol at
the heads of certain men in England and
said to them: 'If you don't support me I
shall denounce you and your complicity in
the raid'?"
At this staee, according to Mr. Robin
son, President Kruger became more ex
cited and shouted so loudly that people In
the street stopped to listen to the conver
sation. Kruger then said:
"And now you are remonstrating, with
me about arming. It is true lam arming,
and It is because I see clearly that I must
defend my country."
To this Mr. Robinson replied: "The
British public is aroused, .if any attempt
were made again to enter this country
