Magersfontein, says: "It is use
less to disguise the fact that a
large percentage of our troops
are beginning to lose heart in
this campaign. The close suc
cession of frontal attacks on an
invisible foe securely intrenched
may well shake the nerve of the
bravest. Our men fought well,
but they have been asked to per
form miracles. The Highland
Brigade marched by orders of
the general commanding in quar
ter column to its doom, almost
falling into the Boer trenches.
Wauchope's last words were,
'For God's sake, men, do not
blame me for this.' "
The Daily News correspond
ent says of the Stormberg disas
ter: "The men were marching
at ease in fours, with their rifles
under their arms, when without
"I know of no war In which Great Brit
ain has been engaged, except that result-
Ing in the Independence of the American
colonies, which did not end triumphantly.
Yet I do not know of one which has begun
triumphantly. True, the war in South
Africa Is disappointing, but it is not a
fact that Great Britain has suffered ex
ceptional reverses or great disaster. On
the other hand the war has knit together
every branch of the English-speaking
race, making all feel that they have a
great, common destiny which it is their
duty to accomplish.
"These are thoughts which ought to
support us in far greater trials than this
war may produce. Remember that a na
tion which cannot bear defeat Is a na
tion unworthy of empire, and although
defeat has not yet come and although
we hope and believe It will not come In
the course of the present war. yet if mat
ters should turn out otherwise we should
still rely upon the courage and patriotism
of our countrymen."
Addressing a second meeting, held In
a suburb of Manchester, Mr. Balfour
said:
"While I am loth to claim in any loud
and arrogant speech that we are In any
special sense the leaders of a great hu
manitarian cause, I deny in the strongest
manner that we are animated by ignoble
motives. No more false or stupid ca
lumny was ever invented than the accu
sation that Great Britain Is animated by
a petty desire to add wealthy regions to
an already gigantic empire. No mere ac
quisition of territory could compensate
for a war costing so much blood and
treasure."
Rear Admiral Lord Charles Beresford,
addressing the London Chamber of Com
meicc. dealing with questions of national
defense, said that, now that war pre
vailed, more attention would be paid per
haps to those who had warned the-coun
try that it was laborinÂ« under a "rotten,
false and misleading system of adminis
tration," so far as the services were con
cerned.
"While I would deprecate the adop
tion of conscription," said Lord Charles,
"I hope the country will insist upon over
hauling and reforming the naval and mil
itary service. In connection with the war
in South Africa. I contend that our gen
erals should be held blamolesj. for they
have been sent to do an Impossibility."
The Times in an editorial based upon
Mr Balfour's declarations severely criti
cises the Government and says:
"It is fortunate for the Government
than when Parliament meets it will only
have to face a weak, opposition. If the
shortcomings now revealed had been re
vealed in a war with a llrst-class Euro
pean power the nation would not have
â¢been- consoled by statem<V)tn Biicii as Mr.
Balfour has been making.- It' is neither
becoming nor. prudent, j>*' J r.r what has
happened, for a Minister to declare, as
Mr. Balfour did, that he does not feel
that he need apologize on behalf of the
Government. It would be better for the
country and for the Ministers them
selves if the latter frankly owned that
they had made a mistake, pleading ex
tenuating circumstances and pledging
themselves to a serious effort to reform
all that has proved wanting."

mors have been fewer in number In this
campaign than usual. The latest of them
current yesterday warn to the effect that
800 Boers who had got down to the Wee

by some natives who were brought In by
an officer.
"Let 'em all come," said General Bul
ler. "No such luck. The enemy will let
us severely alone."
Yesterday's demonstration at Colenso
was at least a pretty affair, if not effec

At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon a
mounted brigade started out from Chieve

BALFOUR SPEAKS
OF POSSIBLE DEFEAT
LONDON, Jan. 9.â Arthur J. BaJfour,
First Lord of the Treasury, speaking this
evening in East Manchester, said:
answer of the British Government to our
representations made last week is not ex
pected for several days.
SEIZED VESSELS ARE
NOW BEING RELEASED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â lnformation
has been received here that the British
authorities have released tbe Dutch
steamer Maria after requiring her to dis
charge part of her cargo at Durban, and
she has been permitted to convey the re
mainder, consisting largely of American
goods, to Delagoa Bay, where she will
deliver them to the consignees, Brlndler
& Co. of Lourenzo Marquez.
It Is presumed the action of the British
authorities Is based upon their contention
that part of the cargo held is contraband
of war. As the Maria's cargo was made
up entirely of provisions. It Is apparent
that the British will hold that that por
tion detained was destined for the Boers
and consequently subject to seizure. The
authorities have reason to believe that
the British answer to Embassador
Choate's representation relative to the de
tention of American cargoes will not be
submitted for several days. The British
Foreign Office and Embassador Choate
are exchanging notes as to the details
connected with the cargoes, and Mr.
Choate has cabled to Secretary Hay for
additional facts. The authorities are sat
isfied that the incident, will be closed to
their satisfaction.
ADEN, Jan. 9. â The Imperial German
mail 'steamer General, detarned here by
the British authorities since January 4
on suspicion of having contraband of war
on board, has been released. After her
cargo had been examined It was found
that she only had a few chemicals and
axle trees on board. Nothing else was
disclosed. A quantity of Trieste flour,
brought by a Lloyd steamer and supposed
to be bound for the Transvaal, has been
held pending the decision of a prize court
DURBAN, Natal, Jan. 9.â The seized
German steamer Herzog has been handed
over to the prize court. The Portuguese
Governor of Zambesa was among her
passengers. The British naval authorl-
ties have offered him a ship to convey him
to Delagoa Bay. The steamer Bundesrath
is discharging.
CASUALTIES AMONG
GEN. FRENCH'S FORCES
LONDON, Jan. 9.â Little change Is ap
parent in the position at Colesberg. Gen
eral French reported to the War Offlco
Sunday morning, January 7, that he had
reconnoitered with a squadron of tha
Household Cavalry on the Boers' east
flank, two miles from Achterlangr. and
drew a considerable force of the burgh
ers, who, being anxious for their com
munications with Norvalspont, withdrew.
The casualties of the Suffolks near Coles
berg were:
Killedâ Colonel "Watson and Lieutenants
Wllkins, Carey and White and twenty
three men.
Missing â Captains Brett, Thompson and
Brown and Lieutenants Allen, "Wood-
Martin and Butter and 107 men.
Wounded â Twenty-one men.
General French further report* that the
casualties of the other regiments to Jan
uary 4 were twelve men killed and forty
four wounded.
EARL OF AVA IS
DYING AT LADYSMITH
NEW YORK. Jan. 9.-The Worlds Lon
don cable says: The Earl of Ava. eldest
son and herr of the Marquis o f Dufferin
and Ava. Is reported to be dying in Lady
smith of a wound in the thigh received
during the recent attack on the place.
Lord Dufferin called at the War Oflica
to-day, having traveled from Ireland to
procure if possible the latest news of his
son. If Lord Ava should die Lord Ter
ence Blackwood. who married Flora Da
vis of New York, would become heir to
the title and estates of the Marquis of
Dufferin and Ava.
NO MEDIATION YET.
LONDON, Jan. W.-King Leopold, ac
cording to the Brussels correspondent oj
the Daily Mail, recently Inquired of Queen
Victoria whether an opportune moment
for mediation had arrived, but received a
reply In the negative.
"SPLENDID LADS."
These were the lan words of Colonel J. Scott Chisholme as he charged
at the head of his men. the Imperial Light Horse, at the battle of Elands
Laagte. Just as he ipoke. in the height of the elation of the victory which i.c
was making more certitln, he was shot through the heart
LONDON, Jan. 10.â Again
there is a dearth of news.
Since Saturday a temporary
peace seems to have descended
on the various fields of the war.
General French has made a re
connoissance toward Achter
lang, which lies on the east of
Colesberg, making the Boers re
tire. General Gatacre gives no
sign, and General Methuen's
force is still lying intrenched on
the Modder River. No further
news of General White's victory
has come through, and it is yet
to be learned at what cost it was
purchased by the garrison.
From Colenso comes intelli
gence of General Buller's demon
stration on Saturday, which em
phasizes the fact that the Boers
are conducting their campaign
with great cunning and skill.
When, with faint hope of draw
ing off some of the Boers from
the attack on Ladysmith, Gen
eral Clery led out a strong force
of cavalry and guns, his left hav
ing as its objective Doornkop
and his right Hlangwana Moun
tain, the Boers refused to disclose
their strength. They evidently
were in their trenches and in Co
lenso, but though both brigades
advanced well up to the positions
these dispatches, and which was
shown in all its glaring faults in
the full descriptions of the battles
of Stormberg, Magersfontein
and Colenso, which reached
England through the mails this
week. Since their publication
a vague feeling of discontent
over the British general's tactics
has developed into outspoken
condemnation. When we read
that men in close formation were
led into a death trap â as hap
pened to the Highland Brigade
at Magersfontein, by order of the
commanding general in spite of
the protests of the general com
manding the brigadeâ or that
the Boer position south of the
river had not been discovered, or
that an important elevation was
taken and not retained owing to
want of supportâ both of which
incidents occurred in the action
on the Tugela; that a night
march was responsible for the
catastrophe at Stormberg, and
again in the case of the Suffolk
Regiment at Colesberg, it is not
surprising that the public is ask
ing why a policy of such well
known danger has been tried so
often in this campaign.

a companion named Maud Raymond when
Carbrey knocked at the door. Bef.ire
either of the women had a chance to an
swer the summons he rushocl in. The
rxpres?ion on his face satisfied the women
that his visit was not one of peace. He
was blazing with anger, yet cool and de
liberate in his preparations to commit
murder. He seated himself on the piano
stool and. drawing a revolver from his
pocket, calmly Informed Miss Hall that
he intended to kill her.
The terrified woman fell on her knees
and pleaded for mercy, but Carbrey only
laughed at her. As he arose from his seat
and started toward his victim Miss Ray
mond rushed between them and attempt
ed to dissuade him from his purpose. He
brushed her rouphly aside, and placing
his r?volver close to the hi>ad of Miss
Hall tired. The bullet took effect in her
neck. With almost superhuman effort
ROO yards, was badly aimed and did not
hit our troopers. General Hildyard's
brigade turned out with three regiments,
the Queen's own, the West Surrey leading
near the railway track, with the East
Surrey on the left and the Devonshire
Regiment in support and as an escort for
the guns. Colonel Reeves led the Irish
Fusileers and Welsh Fusileers toward
Hlangwana. These troops, also in ex
tended lines, marched across the spacious
tract like khaki fence posts. Without loss
both brigades got well up to the position*
where the battle raged fiercest on De
cember 15. The Boers, however, made no
aggressive movement, and with the ex
ception of a f-ilght fusillade, laid low. Four
field batteries opened fire at about 2500
yards' range upon the Boer trenches at 4
o'clock in the afterno.-n and a heavy flre'
was maintained for an hrur. Then the
guns went forward twelve hundred yards,
their distance being well within the range
of the Boer rifies and guns, but still the
enemy kept silent. Our bombardment,
which was heavy iioth from the naval and
field guns, * proceeded until nearly 7
o'clock, when the whole force retired to
quarters. Even General Clery. who com
manded in person and rode down near the
Tugela, failed to draw the Boer guns or
fire of their Mausers.
VIEWS EXCHANGED AS
TO SEIZURES OF FLOUR
LONDON. Jan. 9.â There is some reason
to believe that the United States and
German embassies are trying to find a
common basis on which they can co
operate in pressing their respective de
mands against Great Britain for the
Delagoa Bay seizures. A high official of
the German Embassy had a long confer
ence to-day at the American Embassy and
the diplomats are believed to have dis
cussed the steps each country has already
taken and the best future procedure.
At the came time there is every indica
tion that Great Britain Is showing the
most friendly consideration to the repre
sentatives of both of the embassies and
that the present difficulties will be set
tled amicably. As previously set forth In
these dispatches, It is expected that the
American flour will be speedily released,
while thq release of the German steamer
General Is believed to prelude the libera
tion of the Herzog.- The status of the
Bundesrath is not yet fully settled, but
Germany's representatives believe Great
Britain will give satisfaction for any de
lay occasioned to a legitimate cargo.
Both the United States and German em
bassies are now anxious to obtain a Brit
ish declaration in regard to the treatment
of neutral shius hereafter and It Is be
lieved they exchanged views on the sub
ject.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â lt Is stated
here on authority that the United States
is not co-operating with Germany or any
other Government In representations to
the British Government respecting the
seizure of goods destined for Portuguese
East Africa. Moreover, our Government
does not contemplate any such co-opera
tion, the difference between the cases of
the seized German vessels and the seizure
of American goods, the latter In British
vessels, belng-.ao. pronounced that the
same principles would have no application.
So it is the determination of the State De
partment to conduct. its negotiations on
this point' single-handed and that Is now
being done.
Mr. Choate, American Embassador at
London, is In daily communication with
the Foreign Office as well as with the De
partment of State on this subject. The
negotiations are now in that phase where
both sides are .endeavoring to develop
facts respecting the seizure and the final
ness" and displayed remarkable nerre
while the physicians dressed her wounds
and probed for the bullets. The wounds
are not serious and her chances for re
covery are good.
While the physicians were attending her
she told the story of the shooting and tha
affiJrs that led up to It. She said that
she was born In St. Louis, Mo., twenty
five years ago. She claims that her
father, now dead, was the president of a
bank. She admits that Fannie Hall v
only her stase name. A companion said
her name was Brengel. She says that
she has an aunt living In Chicago named
Mrs. B. D. Spencer.
"I first met Carbrey at Denver, wh*>ro
his family resides." she said. "I did not
lfke him. but he persisted in following me
wherever I went. Two years ago I camo

We did not agree and separated. Carltrrv
followed me here and wanted me to so
with him. To escape him I went to Daw
son City, where I secured a six montb*"
engagement in one of the variety thea
ters. I had been there only a short time
when Carbrey arrived. He threatened to
kill me if I would not go with him. H<Â»
returned wtth me to San Franclaco and
fairly haunted me. until I had to complain
to the police about his actions."
After leaving the Francisco House Car
hrey went to the saloon kept by "Spider"
Kelly, where he told Matt Keefe that hft
and killed Fannie Hall. He left the place
at once, but was located later by the pÂ«>
lice at Kelly's house, where he was ar
rested and taken to the City Prison. Car
brey displayed his brutal nature by brai,
ging to his fellow prisoners of what he
had done an.l expressing the hope that
the woman would die. He is about 25 yoars
of age and has a brother on the detectlva
force In Denver.
where the battle had raged most
fiercely more than three weeks
ago, there was no animated re
sponse to the British challenge.
Even when the artillery came to
within 1200 yards of the Boer
rifles and General Clery himself
rode close to the Tugela
the trenches remained silent.
Interest in the attack on
Ladysmith has been so absorbing

heard upon a certain phase of the
conduct of the British campaign,

F ANNIE HALL, who has been sink

by Tom Carbrey, a tout from Denver.
Colo. The attempted murder took place
In the woman's rooms at the Francisco
House, Taylor and Turk streets, and was
the result of a mad infatuation the man
had for Miss Hall. She did not return his
affections. He had followed her to Daw

had pleaded with her in vain to live with
him. When she finally refused he deter
mined to kill her, and the shooting yester

Miss Hall went to the hotel office, in

The theory that the woman shot Kutrell

BRIBED LEGISLATORS SO
HE COULD EXPOSE THEM
Whiteside of "Montana Continues His
Testimony in the Case of Sen
ator Clark.
WASHINGTON, Jim. 9.â Ex-State Sen
ator Whitepide of Montana continued his
testimony before the Senate Committee
on Privileges and Elections to-day in the
Clark case. He was cross-examined by
Faulkner. He itlontilled two envelopes ex
hibited, which, be said, had contained
money given to him to hold members of
the Legislature. They were marked by
initials and otherwise, which Whiteside
said had been placed on the envelopes
at the time the money was deposited in
them.
Whiteside said that after receiving the
money for other members of the Legis
lature he had placed it in a bank safe
deposit vault, but that when he took it
out, previous to the exposure, he pinned
the envelope containing It to the under
Bide of the bottom of a drawer in a dress-
Ing case in his room. In answer to a
question, the witness said he had noth
ing else in the drawer. .He had, he added,
only rented the drawer at the time he re
ceived the first money.
Whiteside said he had been before the
Lewis and Clark County Grand Jury for
less than an hour, which was explana
tory' of the fact that he had given the
names of men in his testimony here which
had not been given to the Grand Jury
as the names of men who had been im
properly influenced in Senator Clark's fa
vor. He said that In approaching mem
bers of the Legislature in Clark's behalf
he had done so w.*n the hope that they
would refuse the bribes offered, in which
event he had intended to advise them of
his plan of exposure, but that when he
found a man willing to accept the. money
offered he did not take him Into his con
fidence. /
An effort was made to show that White
side had npt had positive knowledge^ of
the placing of Jhe money in the envelopes
from which the $30,000 was taken and
â¢turned over' to the State, and, in this con
nection, counsel for Clark said that it
was the purpose of the defense to show
that Whiteside had placed the money
there himself.
MAYORALTY MUDDLE
IN SACRAMENTO
Land Charges Clark, His Attorney
and the Board of Trustees With
Contempt of Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 9.â The mayoralty
situation presented several interesting de
velopments to-day, the most noteworthy
of which was the suing out of a citation
by Mayor Land charging Mayor Clark
his attorney, Hiram W. Johnson, and thu
entire Board of Trustees of nine mem
bers, with contempt of court in having
failed to comply with the temporary in
junction issued by Judge Johnson last
night restraining those parties from in
terfering with Mayor Land in the dis
charge of his duties as Mayor. In his
complaint Land alleges that he has been
locked out of his oillce and cannot ob
tain the keys.
Mayor Clark last night sent to the
Trustees for confirmation the name of
John E. Sullivan for Chief of Police.
.Mayor Land took his turn at the bat to
day by forwarding to the Trustees as his
appointment for Chief of Police the name
of Robert \V. Ash, who is the present
acting chief, having been Installed as
such upon the death of Chief Dwyer a
few months ago. Clark filed an applica
tion In the Superior Court for the dissolu
tion of the temporary injunction against
him issued last night. It was argued for
several hours and had not been disposed
of when court adjourned until to-morrow.
A fair indication of public sentiment may
be gained from the fact that the Bee to
night prints an editorial protest against
attempts to prevent Clark occupying his
seat before the courts have had a chance
to decide the suit brought against him by
William H. Bradley for alleged violation
of the election law. The Bee, by the way,
strongly opposed Clark during the cam
paign. The Bradley case came up to-day
but was continued until to-morrow.

PORTLAND, Or., Jan. '9. âJudge
Bellinger in the Uniteu States District
Court to-day appointed J. B. Hassett rer

road and Navigation Company. The suit
for a receiver was brought by J. D.
Sprockets & Bros. Company of San Fran
cisco to compel a registry of the stock
and a reorganization of the board of di
rectors of the company. It is alleged that
Spreckels Bros, furnished to R. A. Gra
ham the money to build the railroad and
took as security practically the whole
issue of bonds of the road amounting to
$620,00Q and a majority of the stock in
dorsed but not registered, Graham owing
them on a settlement $523,000. Graham
was given six months to repurchase from
Spreckels Bros, their interest in the stock
and bonds of the road and their Beaver
Hill Coal Company for $550,000, Graham
agreeing that should he not consummate
the purchase he would relinquish to
Spreckels Bros, all his interest in the road
and mine. Accordingly tho securities
were lodged in the Bank of California as
trustee. Graham defaulted In the pay
ment and the trustee turned over the
stock and bonds to Spreckels Bros. The
secretary of the corporation refused to
transfer the stock and to register Spreck
els Bros, on the books as owners of the
property. ' The suit Is brought to compel
a registry of the stock.

SEWALL FAVORS
CONTRACT LABOR
Report of Agent at
Hawaiian Isles.
â '-f â â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â
Harold Sewall, special agent of the
United States at Hawaii, has submitted
a report on labor conditions of the isiand3.
He states at the outset that he gives the
situation exactly as he finds it, and pre-
faces the report with a resume of the dif
ferences between free and contract labor,
his conclusion being in favor of the latter.
The ordinary manual labor on a planta
tion is performed by unskilled labor, con
tract and free, divided among various na
tionalities, Chinese and Japanese being
predominant. Free labor Is employed by
the month or day without contract and
has either come to the country as free
labor or has become such after the usual
three-year contract has expired. While
this class receives higher pay than
men under contract,' the men are liable
to be discharged at a moment's notice
and the plantation gives them nothing but
.wages and shelter while work is going
on. Their position Is exceedingly preÂ»
carious, as distrust between the employer
and employed seems . mutual. The con
tract man's position is fixed by contract.
As a usual thing this is for three years,
when he comes from foreign countries,
and for less time when he is a resident of
the islands. He is certain of steady work
and a fixed amount per month. He can
demand shelter for himself and his fam
ily. For this he must work, when able,
a certain fixed time, per day and a certain
number of days per month, wherever It
pleases his employer, and must otherwise
fulfill the terms of his contract.
Contract labor evidently has its good
side under .certain conditions, according
to Mr. Sewall's statement. It may be that
things are different over there, and per
haps laborers are not troubled very much
by abstract principles concerning the
freedom of men. That their Immediate
needs are supplied is sufficient for them,
and the harangue of a walking delegate ia
something that will have to come later to
them with advancing civilization.
-Â»-*â¢ - Â¦*- ~-* Â» -v >j -w \? -~
some of them are now. They are as fit for self
government as was Japan when she was wel
comed Into the family of nations.
9. That the outbreak of hostilities was not
their fault, but ours. A patrol, not a hostile
military force, approached a small village be
tween the lines of the two armies, a village
on the American side of the line of demarka
tion to which some of our soldiers had been
moved In disregard of the rule applicable to all
cases of truce. When this patrol approached
this town it was challenged. How far the
Filipinos understood our language and how far
our pickets understood the reply that they made
In their own language does not appear. But
we fired on them first. The fire was returned
from their lines. Thereupon it was returned
again from us and several Filipinos were
killed. As soon as Aguinaldo hÂ°ard of it he
sent a message to General Otis saying that the
firing was without his knowledge and against
his will: that he deplored It and that he de
sired hostilities to cease anil would withdraw
his troops to any distance General Otis should
desire. To which the American general replied
that as the fighting had begun it must go on.
13. Tiiat on the 2Kth of December, ISSS, the
two Â«iiios being at peace, although great uneasi
ness and irritation had already manifested lt
telf on the part of the Filipinos, who were
afrai'l we meant to subjugate them. President
McKlnley sent General Otis a proclamation
which he cr.mmaniled him to Issue. General
Otis, on reading Itâ to ufc the language of hia
reportâ concluded that there were certain words
an 1 expressions therein, such as "sovereignty."
"right of cession," and those who directed Im
mediate occupation, though most admirably em
ployed and tersely expressive of artual condi
tions, night be advantageously useit by thfc
Tagalo war party to incite widespread hostili
ties amr.ng the natives. Whereup'n General Otis
proceeds to amend the President's proclama
tion by striking out everything in It which con
talris a purpose to assume sovereignty or pro
tection and which was significant of future
political domination; and instead thereof, he
issued a proclamation in which he suppressed
all these utterances and assures them that It
Is the purpose of the people of the United
States to give them "in every possible way the
full measure of Individual liberty which is the
heritage of a free people." That assurance which
General Otis gave to the people of Manl'.a Is
Just what I have always wanted and all 1 have
always wanted to give them. But, unhappily.
General Otis' proclamation was frustrated. In
the meantime he had sent a copy of the Presi
dent's p.oclamatlon to General Miller, w.ho was
lying opposite Hollo, burning for a fight, and
who. much to General Otis' distress, as his dis
patches show, published it. So we have the com
mander denying all purpose of domination or
of interfering with their Independence on the
one hand and the President of the United
States on the other asserting that purpose, and
the Filipinos .were naturally alarmed and
shocked. Now put* yourselves, men of Essex,
in the places of these people. What would your
fathers have done If General Gage and Lord
North had been the actors? What would any
people on the face of the earth,' whose bosoms
are capable of holding the sentiment of liberty,
have done? Is It not Infamous for. anybody to
turn around and tell you that the men who be
lieve that the Filipinos should have been as
sured Just what General Otis tried to assure
them of, are responsible for the outbreak of
the war? General Otis says that the proclama
tion which actually came out. through General
Miller's departure from lv' intention*, was cal
culated to cause and did cause hostilities
and excite alarm and indignation in the bosoms
of that freedom-seeking people.
HOAR AND RAWLINS
DEMAND INFORMATION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â Senator Hear
to-day introduced the following resolu
tion:
Resolved, That the President be requested, If
In his judgment It Is not Incompatible with the
public interests, to communicate to the Senate
all communications which have been received
by him or by any department or officer, civil
or military, from Agulnaldo or any other per
son undertaking to represent the people In
arms against the United States In the Philip
pine Islands or any alleged government or pub
lic authority of said people, and all replies to
such communications. Also such proclamations
by him issued to the people of the Philippine
Islands, actually directed by him to be issued
and such as were actually proclaimed by Gen
eral Otis, and if In any respect they were al
tered or any part of them were omitted.
Also, to Inform the Senate whether any ap
proval or disapproval was expressed by his
authority or that of the War Department after
such change. If any.
Also, all constitutions, forms of government
or proclamations issued by Aguinaldo or any
congress or legislative assembly, or body claim-
Ing to be such, or convention of the people of
the Philippine Islands or any part thereof, or
claiming to rppreyent them or any part thereof,
of which information may have come to him
or to any department of the Government.
And the President to he further requested
to communicate without- delay so much of said
Information as Is now In his possession or In
that of any department .at Washington, with
out waiting to obtain ab much of said Infor
mation as may requlrf considerable delay or
communication with the Philippine Islands,
and to communicate the remainder of the in
formation as soon thereafter as it can be ob
tained.
Hoar endeavored to secure immediate
consideration for his resolution, but on ob
jection it went over until to-morrow.
Senator Rawlins of Utah introduced a
resolution to-day, which was referred to
the Philippine committee, directing the
committee to inquire into and report:
First â What form Of government, insurgent,
revolutionary or dictatorship, other than that
of the kingdom of Spain, existed in the Phil
ippine Islands prior to December 10, 1899, and
to what extent Spain had actual control of the
islands T
Secondâ Can sovereign power be Justly and
in accordance with international law claimed
in the absence of power to control?
FRANKFORT. Ky., Jan. 9.â The
House balloted for United States
Senator with the following result:

Senators Crenshaw and McConnell
(Pops.) voted for Blackburn, and Hayes

men, were not present.
The Joint assembly will ballot to-mor

whether the ballot should occur to-day
or next Tuesday, the proceedings of to
morrow will be duplicated, on the corre
sponding days of next week.
Common Sense
is possessed by most people who think for
themselves. The average man knows that
if his blood is impure he feels sick all
over. He has headache, nausea, bad taste
in the mouth, is costive and can put no
energy into his work. The kidneys are de-
signed to purify the blood, but if diseased
and tired out they cannot do it. Extra
work is thrown on the liver and lungs,
and they, too, become diseased under the
additional burden until the whole body is
completely poisoned. What is to be done?
Common sense says put the kidneys, the
b!ood-purifying organs, in good health, and
do it at once with Warner's Safe Cure
before the k dneys break down and disin-
tegrate from Bright's disease. â Warner's
Safe Cure, a purely vegetable preparation,
has cured thousands of men and women
during the past twenty years who were in
danger of death. It does exactly as repre-
sented, and does it quickly. One bottle
will aid, a few bottles will cure. It is not a
cheap decoction, but a scientific preparation
carefully compounded. Do not longer trifle
'with your health, but give this great remedy
an opportunity to cure you.
SENATE DEBATE
ON IMPERIALISM
Beveridge fldvocates ExpaQsion
and Is Replied To by
rjoor.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 9.â "That man lit
tle knows the common people of the re
public, little understands the instincts of
our race who thinks we will not hold it
(the Philippine archipelago) fast and hold
it forever, administering just government
by simplest methods."
This sentence was the keynote of the
speech delivered in the Senate to-day by
Beveridge, the junior Senator from In
diana. It was the maiden speech in the
Senate of about the youngest member of
that body. At the conclusion of the
speech unrestrained applause swept over
the galleries and it was notable that Sec
retary of the Treasury Gage, who occu
pied a seat in the Senators' gallery, was
a participant in it.
Hoar (Rep.) qf Massachusetts replied
brieily to Beveridge. Although he did not
enter fully into the merits of the question
under discussion, he felt that some of the
Senator's statements ought not to go lotlie
country unchallenged. He declared that
not the American opposition to the war
but the President's proclamation to the
Filipinos was responsible for the hostili
ties. He ridiculed Beveridge's statement
that the Filipinos were not capable of
self-government and quoted General Otis'
reports to show that they were.
In the course of his speech Beveridge
said:
The Philippines are ours forever, territory
belonging to the United States, as the consti
tution calls them. And Just beyond the Philip
pines are China's illimitable markets. We will
not retreat from either. We will not repudiate
our duty in the archipelago. â¢ We will not aban
don our opportunity in the Orient. J We will
not renounce our Dart in the mission of our
race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of
the world. And we will move forward to our
work, not howling out regrets, like slaves
whipped to their burdens, but with gratitude
for a task worthy of our strength, and thanks
giving to Almighty , God that he has marked
us as hla chosen people, henceforth to lead in
the regeneration of the world.
Hoar, who haiÂ» been a careful listener
to the speech of Beveridge, as soon as he
could make himself heard said that ho
had been delighted with the eloquence of
the Senator Irom Indiana.
"1 am glad," he said, "to welcome to
the public service his enthusiasm, his sil
very speech and the earnestness with
which he is disposed to discharge his
duty."
Yet, he said, he had listened in vain for
those words which the American people
have taken on their lips in solemn crises.
The words "right, justice, duty ana free
dom" were absent from the eloquent ad
dress. The beauty and eloquence of the
speech had recalled that incident in which
Satan had taken Christ up into an ex
ceedingly high mountain and shown him
all the kingdoms of the world and the
glory thereof and promised that all should
be his if he would but fall down and wor
ship, and he had replied:
"Get thee behind me, Satan."
Hoar declared - that practically every
statement of fact in the speech was refut
ed by Government reports received from
Admiral Dewey, General Otis and from
other official 'sources. "Where did Spain
get the right to sell her right in the Phil
ippines?" Hear asked. Where did the
United States get the right to buy and
sell people like sheep? He was certain
that for all the wealth and commerce and
glory which hft had eloquently depicted
the Senator from Indiana would not have
great injustice done.
Hoar declared the Filipinos had the
Spaniards hemmed in in Manila and the
latter were obliged to surrender. He
thought it woula be necessary to revise
the constitution before those Filipinos
could be bought and sold. He did not be
lieve lieveriage would advise the Ameri
can ppople to do this thing or to do any
thing so base as to strike down the infant
Filipino republic. .*
The Massachusetts Senator made fre
quent references to and quotations from
the reports of General Otis and Admiral
Dewey and oth*>r officers in the Philip
pines. Those showed, he asserted, that
when Agulnaldo* arrived,- in Luzon, from
Hongkong the insurgents had an army of
3U,00o; that in the- island of Luzon the Fili
pinos maintained' courts, schools, munici
pal governments and churches, and that
peace and order prevailed generally.
Spanish prisoners were kindly treated.
"This," declared Hoar, "is the condition
of things which it Is proposed to crush
under our heels. And that," he added,
"you call glory."
Hoar referred to Beveridge's statement
that the present condition of warfare was
due to utterances in this country. This
he denied, and pointed out that in De
cember, IS9B, the President had sent a
proclamation to General Otis for publica
tion to the Filipinos. General Otis re
turned the proclamation, with the state
ment that after full consideration of the
terms "sovereignty, right of cession," etc.,
he was convinced they were calculated to
cause an immediate outbreak of hostili
ties. General Otis amended the procla
mation by making the statement:
"I am convinced that it is the intention
of the Government of the United States
to seek the establishment of the most lib
eral government in the Philippines."
This appeared in the proclamation pub
lished to the Filipinos, but a copy of the
actual proclamation of the President fell
into the hands of the Filipino leaders and
precipitated hostilities. General Otis had
promised, Hoar said, a government to the
Filipinos in which they would be able to
exercise a full measure of their individual
rights.
"Did he utter this promise to a people
Incapable of self-governmentâ to half-sav
aÂ«?es and half-Spaniards?" demanded
Ifoar.
He thought it bold to charge those men
who had opposed this war from the be
ginning with the responsibility for all the
blood being shed. He declared that thf-re
had not been a time when, if General Otis
had been able to give assurances of inde
pendence to the Filipinos, the war would
not have terminated.
HOAR PLEADS THE
CAUSE OF FILIPINOS
Most Interesting I/etter Sent by the
Senator to Leading Editors
' of- Boston.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â Senator Hoar
of Massachusetts has made public a let
ter he has addressed to the editors of the
Journal, Advertiser, Herald and Globe of
Boston In answer to a speech made by
ex-Representative Quigg at the Essex
Club t the last Saturday in December. In
this speech Mr. Quigg, referring to Sen
ator Hoar's attitude on the Filipino ques
tion, declared that the Senator "wants us
to skulk from our duty."
Senator Hoar assarts that the dis
patches of Admiral Dewey and General
Otis (some of the latter read by him, he
says, having been withheld thus far from
public knowledge) establish beyond rea
sonable doubt:
1. That Agulnaldo is an honest, patriotic and
brave man. Indeed, that is the express testi
mony of Mr. Schurman, president of the Philip
pine Commission.
2. That Aguinaldo was the chosen leader of
the people of the Philippine Islands.
. 3. That the people have from the beginning
desired independence and desire it now.
4. That this desire was communicated to our
. commanders when they gave them arms, ac
cepted their aid and brought Agulnaldo from
his cxil'e, when he was put in command of 30,
000 Filipino soldiers, who were already in arms
and organized.
. 6. That the people of the Philippine Islands,
before we flred upon their troops, have deliv
ered their own land from Spain, with the sin
gle exception of the town of Manila, and that
they hemmed in the Spanish troops on land by
a line extending from water to water.
6. That we could not have captured the Span
ish garrison, which was done by an arrange
ment beforehand, upon a mere show of resist
ance, but for the fact that they were so
hemmed In by Agulnaldo'a forces and could not
retreat beyond the range and fire of the guns
of our fleet.
7. That during all this period to the final
conflict the Filipinos were repeatedly inform
ing our Government that they desired their
freedom and that they were never informed or
any purpose on our part to subdue them.
8. That they were fit for independence. They
had churches, libraries, works of art and edu
cation. They were better educated than many
American communities within the memory of
: some of us. They were governing their entire
islands except Manila in order and quiet, with
municipal governments, courts of Justice,
schools and a complete constitution, resting
upon the consent of the people. They were
better fitted for self-government than any
country on the continent south of us from the
Kio Qrande to Cape Horn, San Domingo or
HaytPwhen they received their independence,
, and are better fitted for eeir-government than

SAN DIEGO, Jan. Â£>.â News was re

Leandro. The latter, it seems, had sought

PASADENA'S ANTI-SALOON
FIGHT WAXES WARM
Sanitary Board Collecting Evidence
Against Those Who Have Evaded
the Law by a Ruse.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Jan. 9.â When the Anti-
Saloon League people won their fight at
the polls last October and passed the san
itary law they thought that the saloons
or roadhouses to the east and north of
this city had been vanquished. Now they
are finding that the light was but just
begun on that day. It is still hot and the
sanitary board this week entered into con
sultation with the District Attorney to
find if possible what steps should be taken
to close the saloons completely. Up to
this time , the "blind pigs" have been
blinded in one eye only. The board was
advised to bring suit against the saloons
and will do so. The proprietors will be
prosecuted for refusing to obey the order
of the board.
The sanitary district is an organization
provided for by legislative act, the sani
tary board being given power to refuse or
grant liquor licenses. North Pasadena
and Lamanda Park organized simply for
the purpose of gaining power over the sa
loons. As soon as the board had been or
ganized, after all manner of legal quib
bles had been decided in Its favor, notices
were posted ordering the saloons to close
within a given time. Instead of closing,
the saloon keepers, on the advice of their
attorneys, removed the signs from their
places of business and substituted there
for eipns announcing the business as
"wholesale.? For a time this ruse has
been successful, but the sanitary board,
having reason to believe that the liquor
was sold on the sly in other ways than
could be termed wholesale. Is now tak
ing further steps.

PULITZER'S HOUSE
RAZED BY FLAMES
Two Servants Perish in
the Fire.
NEW YORK. Jan. 9.-The handsome
residence of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of
the New York World, at 10-12 East Fifty-
Jifth street, was destroyed by fire to-day
and two women servants were suffocated
or burned to death. The total loss is es
timated at about $300,0u0. The Insurance
Is $250,000.
The victims of the fire were Mrs. Mor- j
pan Jeileit, the housekeeper, and Miss j
.Elizabeth Montgomery, a governess.
The dwelling was c. four-story building j
of stono and briok, with carved entrance, j
The dining-room was famous for its hand- i
come linings. There was a conservatory j
adjoining, and here the fire started. The :
origin of the fire is variously ascribed to
electric wires, the steam heater and an 1
open fire. It started about 7:30 .a. m., !
â¢while Mrs. Pulitzer, her daughters Con- ;
ttar.ee and Edith. 12 and 14 years of age i
respectively, Herbert, a boy of 3, and |
the housekeeper and governess were j
asleep. Air. Pulitzer and his son Joseph j
Jr.. were at Lakewood. There were six- ;
leen servants in the house.
The servants in the house and the pass
ers-by discovered the fire about the same
time. There was not much smoke, but
the tiam<*s spread rapidly and were soon
beyond control. Mrs. Pulitzer got her
fhildren together and with the aid of
their nurses got them safely tn the street
end then to an adjoining dwelling. Sev
eral of the servants had narrow escapes,
tine of them making his way out of the
building by the way of the roof. He said
that bÂ« saw Mrs. Jellett on the roof and
that she went back to get a bag contain
ing Christmas presents. When the fire
jnen found the body of the housekeeper
on the top floor the bag was in her hand.
Jx contained a number of silver trinkets
end fancy articles. The woman's body
Vas partly burned.
The body of the governess. Miss Mont
pomery. was discovered after several
Jiours, in the ruins on the third floor.
The woman had only time to put on a
rkirt and bathrobe with a pair of slip
pers, before phe was overcome. Her body
was not badly burned, showing that she
probably had been suffocated.
Mrs. Pulitzer, who is a niece of Jeffer
fnn Davis, had a number of jewels in a
pafe in the house, which was burned In
rhe ruins. She said that everybody had
time to get out of the house after the fire
Started, as there was smoke only for
6ome minutes before the flames.
The building was completely ruined by
the fire. The contents were an entire
Jnpfi, and these alone, it is estimated,

TRIAL TRIP OF
CRUISER ALBANY
Hig.-i Speed of the New
Warship.
NEWCASTLE, Eng.. Jan. 9.â The
United States cruiser Albany, formerly
the Brazilian' cruiser Abroiiall, purchased
by the United States Government shortly
before the beginning of the war with
Spain while under construction here, was
given a successful official trial off this
port to-day. She developed a speed of
20.5>7 knots, showing thorough seaworthi
ness, and exceeding her contract condi
tions.
The trial was under the supervision of
the L'niltd States Naval Board, consist
ing of Lieutenant Commander Colwell,
the United Slates naval attache; Chief
Engineer Norton, and Constructor Gil
more.
Once out in* the Xorth Sea the Albany
began to tune up. Four times she
steamed past the measured mile, running
under natural draught at a mean speed
of ly.ti knots, whicn was six-tenths of
a knot above contract speed. Then came
ihe crucial test. Forced draught was
brought to bear against the tide and wind.
'I he Albany, which previously had not
made any fuss, began to throw up sea
from her ram to the bridge, but she
cleared the waves as steadily as possible
until .she reached a speed of 2U.8? knots.
Her mean speed over the four measuitd
miles under forced draught was 20.50. Her
contract speed was 2U Knots, but she is
easily capable of an additional knot.
The Armstrongs claim that to-day's
testMhow the Albany is the equal of any
vessel of her class afloat.
Coming up the Tyne the Albany flashed
her new Cuwper-Oowles searchlights, ex
f>eriimnting for the first time with metai
ic instead of glass reflectors. The results
wore satisfactory.
The Albany was greeted with tooting
from the harbor vessels, and the crew of
the British training ship Wellesiey
cheered her heartily.

Terry sent back terrific rights over Dix
on's heart. Dixon rushed repeatedly, but
Mac blocked him every time and kept his
right going like a trip hammer on Dixon's
chest and Btomach. Terry hooked a ter
rific left to the ear at close quarter*.
After a clinch Dixon landed a straight
left on Mac's mouth. Dixon tried this
again, but Terry got inside and sent a
hard right and left to the face, breaking
Dixon's nose, and the colored man went
back to the ropes, with Terry after him.
Dixon bled freely as he returned to his
corner.
EIGHTH HOUND.
Dixon tried his usual opening with a loft
swing, but Terry was Inside, sending his
right to the body and head. Terry arove
Dixon to the ropes, where George slipped
to the floor. Terry helped Dixon to his
feet amid the cheers of the crowd and
Dixon backed Into Terry's corner, where
he went down again. Terry was ready
for him, and under body blows the cham
pion went down again.- Dixon was up in
live seconds and staggered to the center
of the rinp. Terry went after him relent
lessly, planting left and right hooks on
the jaw, and George dropped to the tloor.
Dixon took the full count, getting up on
the tenth second. Terry was ready for
him and under body blows the champion
went down again to take the count once
more. It looked hopeless for Dixon. but
he was game to the core and got up to
face certain defeat. He tried to get away
but his legs failed, and Terry closed In
quickly and sent his left and right to the
body. Dixon clinched, but was again
forced to the floor with a fearful right on
the body. Once more he struggled to his
feet, and Terry went to him v.ith the left
and right and Dixon fell twice. He got
up quickly, to go down for the eighth

ROOT OUTPOINTS WEST.
Given the Decision at the End of a
Six-Round Contest.
CHICAGO. Jan. 9â Jack Root of Chi
cago was given the decision over Tommy
West of Nf.w York at the end of six
rounds in Tattersall's Pavilion to-night.
The men fought at catch wights. West
was evidently the heavier man of the two.
In the first and second rounds honor3
were about even. Root landed the more
blows, but West wrestled him to the floor
and roughed it generally. In the thinl
round Root obtained a clear margin,
standing West oft and hammering him
with left jabs and right upperhooks.
WÂ»>st fought back furiously, but Root
was the stronger ancl quicker awl haci
West bleeding freely at the nose when
the round closed.
In the fourth round Root went after
his man savagely, giving a straight left
to his nose the lnatnnt they came to
gether. He followed this up with left
and right swing*, making West at the
close of the round very groggy. In tha
fifth West started off well, but soon shot
his bolt and Hoot was all over him.
In the sixth Hoot started in to finish
his man if possible and. although he had
West going within a minute, he was not
able to put him out. West hung on, try-
Ing to avoid Root's jabs and swings, and
could hardly have lasted another minute,
when he was saved by the gong. Referee
Siler gave the decision to Root, the re
sult being greeted with loud cheers.
Manager Lou Houseman managed the
contests, which were attended by the
largest crowd that ever witnessed a box
ing contest in Chicago.
'"Young Oriffo" of Australia was given
the decision over young Kenny of Chi
cago. The men wÂ«-re to have fought at
132 pounds, but Kenny was at least fif
teen pounds over weight. Criffo had tha
better of the tight through all the six
rounds, and, after being declared the vic
tor, sr.id he would tight any man in Amer-
Icu. at 133 pounds for $3>JO.
Alexian Brother Is Called by Death.
CHICAGO. Jan. o.â Rev. Aloyslua
Schyns. head of the Order of Alexian
Brothers in the I'nited States, died here
a right to the body and left to the chin.
Dixon rushed and with a straight left to
the face jarred Terry's head. Terry
rushed back viciously, putting a left to
the head and driving his ripht hard to
the body. The Brooklyn. te rushed George
to the ropes, planting his left on the ribs
and hooking his rignt to the body. Dixon
missed a left swing for the head, Terry
getting inside and planting right and left
on the body. As they broke from a clinch
at the bell Terry hooked a right to the
jaw and Dixon looked badly as he walked
to his corner.

Dixon made the lead as usual, but fallci

NEW YORK. Jan. 9.â Terry Mc-
Govern to-night wrested the
feat her- weight championship of
the world from George Dlxon, who
had defended it for nearly nine
years. To pave Dixon from a knock-out
Tom O'Rourke, his manager, threw up the
pponge in the eighth round when the
negro was staggering helplessly, bleeding
and weak, but as game as the dying glad
iator.
The fight took place before a crowd that
racked the Broadway Athletic Club and
the victory decided the ownership of st
510,000 purse. "When Dixon and McGovern
stepped on the scales this afternoon to
make the necessary US pounds Dlxon
Feemed to bo In the better condition. He
was full of life and energy and looked as
if the maklr? of the weight had not
troubled him, while McGovern seemed to
be too finely drawn. When they stepped
Into the ring, however, McGovern's face
showed no trace of a rigid training course,
and as soon as they stripped each looked
In perfect condition.
Dixon from the first tap of the gong
was on the aggressive, using a left swing
Invariably as his lead, which McGovern
cleverly stepped Inside of and Terry sent
both hands la rapid order to Dixon's
lower works. McGovern's attack on the
body was a surprise to Dlxon. as no boxer
who ever faced the r.egro was able to land
on the wind, ribs and kidneys as did Mc-
Govern to-n'.cht.
Dixon jarred McGovern a half-dozen
times during the battle with hard cracks
on the head or Jaw, but Terry was always
back at his man In a Jiffy, relentlessly

FRIED ONIONS
Indirectly Caused tha Death of the
"World's Greatest General.
It Is a matter cf history that Isapo'eon
Tvas a gourmand, an Inordinate lover of
the good thir.gs of the table, and history
further records that h!s favorite dish was
fried or.;or.f=; his death from cancer of
stomach. It is claimed also, was probably
caused from his excessive indulgence of
ih'.s fondness for the odorou3 vegetable.
The cnion is undoubtedly a whole-
Fome article of food, in fact has many
medicinal qualities of value, but it would
be difficult to find a more Indigestible ar-
ticle than fried onions, and to many peo-
ple they are pimply poison; but the onion
<>o<;s net Etand alone in this respect. Any
article of food that is not thoroughly di-
gested becomes a eource of disease and
discomfort whether it be fried onions or
beefsteak.
The rea.-on why any wholesome food is
not promptly digested 13 because the
ftonxach lacks some important element of
cirestion, some stomachs laxrk peptone,
others are deficient in pastric Juice, etill
others lack hydrochloric acid.
The one thing necessary to do In any
race of poor digestion li? to supply those
elements of digestion which the stomach
'.acks. and nothing does this bo thorough-
ly and safely as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Dr. Richardson !n writing a thesis on
treatment of dyspepsia and indigestion,
closes his remarks by saying: "For those
pufl'erirg from acid dyspepsia, shown by
pour, watery risings, or for flatulent dys-
popsia Fhown by gas on stomach, causing
heart trouble and difficult breathing, as
well as for all oihor forms of stomach
trouble, the safest treatment is to take
cne or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
aft<Â»r each meal. I advise them because
they contain no harmful drugs, but are
composed of valuable digestives, which
act promptly upon the food eaten. I never
knew a caÂ«:e of indigestion or even chronic
dyspepsia which Stuart's Tablets would
not reach."
Cheap cathartic mÂ«Ml!c!nes claiming to
cure dyspepsia, end Indigestion can have no
effect whatever in actively digesting the
food and to call any cathartic medicine a
cure for indigestion is a misnomer.
Every druggist in the I'nted States and
Canada sr-'As Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets,
and they are not only tha safest and most
fuccessful but the most scientific of any
treatment for indigestion and etomach
troubles.

smashing with either hand to the riba or
Etomach.
The seventh round was disastrous for
Dixon. Terry almost broke Dixon's ncse
in this round, after he had sent a right
hand smash which landed over Dlxon's
heart. Dixon staggered to his corner with
the blood spouting from his nasal organ.
Dixon came up as game as ever a man
did in the eighth round, which proved to
be the last. Early in this round Dlnon
slipped to the floor near the ropes from a
clinch, and McGovern earned the cheer**
of the spectators by helping him to his
feet. A few moments later Dixon stepped
on a wet spot in McGovern's corner nnd
Flipped to the floor for a second time. It
was seen that Dlx'on had almost shot his
bolt, and McGovern, rushing, put left and
right to the Jaw, flooring the champion.
Dixon took the greater part of the count
this time, and as he arose slow Terry,
who stood scarcely four feet away, was
ready to rush at him. Dlxon -went down
again from a body blow. He touched
the floor eight times in the round, the last
five times being the result of terrific body
punches.
A few seconds before the round would
have been completed Dixon stood up from
his eighth fall, but his manager and back
er, Tom O'Rourke, seeing that it was Im
possible for the negro to hold on to his
title, threw up the sponge within one sec
ond of the call of time which would have
ended the round. In this O"Rourke showed
good Judgment. Both he and Dlxon have
often said that the latter would never be
knocked out again.
When O'Rourke threw up the sponge
Dixon was practically helpless. While Mc-
Govern was hailed with vociferous cheers
as thÂ« winner and was cheered again and
again as the champion, Dlxon, the ex
champion, was not forgotten. Round af
ter round of cheers wa.s given for the lad
who had defended the title so cleverly for
nearly nine years, as he left the ring
bleeding and beaten, after probably hav
ing fought his last ring contest.
When the contestants returned to their
dressing rooms Dlxon was badly marked,
but McGovern showed very little sign of
having come through a hard encounter.
The only marks that McGoven had were
scratches on the right side of his neck,
where Dlxon's left swings had gone
around, scratching the skin.
Dlxon felt his defeat very keenly and
had very little to say except that McGov
ern was the best man he had ever met
and that Terry in. his present condition
could have beaten any man that Dlxon
had ever defeated.
The betting before the fight was all in
McGovern"s favor. There were many
wagers made at 100 to 70, and so much Mc-
Govern money came into Fight at tho
ringside that these odds were extended to
100 to C 5. A local bookmaker stimulated
the Dlxon people by placing $3000 against
JKWO, he taking the Dixon end, and four
others clubbing together putting up the
$5000 on McGovern. Sam Harris, McGov
ern's manager, had a roll of bills as big

MANILA, Jan. 9.â After a long and tlre
fomo march from San Pedro Macate Gen
eral Schwan's brigade reached Muntlnlupa
on Friday evening. The enemy left a half
hour prior to the arrival of the Macabebe
scouts. They were then retreating to the
south. A cavalry scouting party was sent
southward and reported that the insur
gents were a short distance off. The in
surgents opened lire and the cavalry re
turned to camp, having had orders not to
engage the enemy.
General Schwan early on the morning of
January 6 divided his command, sending
two battalions of the Thirtieth Regiment
and the Forty-.Â«ixth Regiment, with a
wagon train, along the coast toward Bl
mang. The general himself proceeded
along with the Macabebe scouts and
Steele's battalion of the Thirtieth Regi
ment, Colonel Hayes' cavalry and three
mountain guns. He took the trail inland
toward Birnang. When a short distance
from the town the Macabebe scouts and
Hayes" fifty scouts encountered the en
rmy. The insurgents were soon routed".
Two Americans were wounded.
The enemy retreated across the moun
tain regions of Silam. Major Nolan's
squadron of the Eleventh Cavalry went
several miles to the westward, but failed
to develop anything. San Pedro Tunacan
was deserted and three gun carriages,
found in a cane field, were evidence that
the guns had been recently removed.
After our troops had reached a broad
rice field near Benan, the enemy was dis
covered calmly watching the advancing
troops. They then occupied a position
with the protection of a low stone wall
along a creek a quarter of a mile long.
.The Macabebe scouts deployed, followed
by Steele's battalion of the Thirtieth
Regiment. The enemy was In plain veiw.
A formation was effected and the Amer
icans were soon within range. When
at about 100 yards' distance the enemy
opened fire, killing Corporal Johnson of
Company E and wounding two men of
Company F of the Thirtieth Regiment.
The men were never before under fire,
but advanced cheering. The insurgents
retreated to town.
When our troops reached the outskirts
they observed the enemy down the road
in the plaza. Hayes' Fifth Cavalry scouts
charged and were received with only a
few shots. The enemy disappeared, "but
the presence of many amigos indicated
that they were resorting to their old tac
tics. Several natives who had discarded
their uniforms were found and arrested.
The natives here say that the insur
gents had six companies, of 500 men, un
der General Noriel. They occupied the
town yesterday and sent a wagon train
toward Sllln, or Carmono. When they
heard of General Schwan's advance they
left approximately 200 men as a rear
guard. ; ',/-
The Insurgents' loss to-day is unknown.
! Four bodies were found and also one
wounded man. Several rifles were cap
tured.
Colonel Bullard of the Thirty-ninth Reg
iment entered the town of Raiding three
days ago and drove out the insurgents.
The latter returned subsequently.
A scouting party to-night reported that
the enemy are two miles outside of the
Silin road. It is believed that the Ameri

The order assigning Colonel Freeman to

fore the vessel sails. It was not deemed
advisable to issue it until the last mo
ment, although Colonel Freeman has
known since Monday last that it was
more than probable he would leave on
that transport and made his preparations
accordingly. Last Monday he received a
personal letter from General Shafter com
plimenting him upon the zeal and ability
with which he had executed the duties of
his command, even when he had under
him over 12,000 men, the command of a
major general, and expressing the hope
that he would safely endure the campaign
in the Islands and return with the recopn - l
tion he ripperven 1 -
Mayor a matter of four or five minutes
to send him back to the board room with
a smile that registered ten degrees and
more above Barbat' s. Half an hour later,
after the new board had demanded pos
session of the office, Mayor Phelan moved
that the old board go out without pro
test. Barbat looked at Dr. Coffey. who
had opened the projected contest, and to
the surprise of both Coffey and Lawlor
eeconded the Mayor's motion. When it
came to a vote Coffey saw Payne waver
ing and Jumped on him with both feet,
but after a bad five minutes Payne went
over to the Mayor and the meeting was
out.
After the session was adjourned Coffey,
Lawlor and Secretary Carroll could not
give expression to their feelings. They
upbraided the deserters and demanded
explanations, which were not forthcom
ing. Yesterday, according to the princi-
Fals. a sufficient reason for their unlooked
or action was found. It was Eald that
when Barbat grot to talking with the
Mayor he was reminded that one of tho
members of the new board would go out
of office and a successor would be ap
pointed for a four-year term at the end
of the year, and it was suggested to him
that no better man probably than him
self could be found to serve the city in
the vacancy. It was also held out that a
four-year term after the wait of a year
would be much more to his advantage
than a contest against the charter, which
would tend to bring him in discredit with
the public. It was shortly after this that
he reappeared in the outer room and
Colonel Sullivan changed his mind about
the ambulance.
The Mayor swung on Dr. Payne with a
letter from the doctor's father-in-law,
John I. Sabln, president of the telephone
company. Dr. Payne was a candidate for
appointment to the new board, and dur
ing his tight got his father-in-law to
write to the Mayor. Sabin dictated a let
ter in which wore set forth the doctor's
aspirations and the assurance that
whether the Mayor should appoint him or
not Mr. Sabin would not permit him to
take any part in the proposed contest
against the charter. It was the Mayor's
Intention to read that letter in the open
board, but Payne finally prevailed upon
him not to do so. and after receiving the
assurance that he also would make in
excellent successor to some one or other
on the new beard the doctor worked up
a smile and went back to help Barbat.
Drs. Coffey and I^awlor and Secretary
Carroll found these things out yesterday,
a-8 did several others on the inside, and
for some minutes the eorriior resounded
with a broken conversation that would
not look well in type.

sons owing the estates died and therefore
the moneys may be applied to the bills in
curred in past years.
The Stanford inheritance tax, which
amounts to nearly $230,000 of the total
amount collected, may be applied to the
demands of the year in which Senator
Stanford died. Auditor Wells contends
that no claims take precedence of the
teachers' salaries for November and De
cember, 1898, and therefore it is quite cer
tain that the teachers will be made happy
by receiving at least a portion of the
moneys due them. As other inheritance
taxes are paid in to the State the moneys
will be applied to paying off the remainder
of those obligations.

NEW CITY HALL TO BE
MADE CLEAN AS WAX
The Board of Public Works took active
steps at its meeting yesterday in the mat
ter of cleaning the new City Hall, which
has been in a filthy condition for several
months past owing to the disinclination on
the part of the janitors to perform the
duties for which they were employed and
paid by the City. Mat Smith was deposed
from nia position as head Janitor and
William F. Sawyer was elected to fill the
vacancy. In nominating Sawyer Commis
sioner Manson referred to the present dis
graceful condition of the corridors and
offices In the City Hall and spoke of the
necessity of employing- a competent man
to see that it was kept as clean as some
of the model office buildings in the down
town districts. The new head janitor was
allowed eight of the old force of assistant
Janitors and was instructed to begin the
work of cleaning the hall at once.
Chief Engineer Grunsky was authorized
to collect the same fees on street work
surveys which formerly prevailed during
the City Surveyor's regime. New fees will
be established at to-day's meeting for lot
Tax Collector Sheehan sent a communi
cation describing the damage done in his
office during the unpleasantness last Mon
day. No action was taken, as the board
will get the opinion of City Attorney Lane
regarding the responsibility for the dam
age.
At the board's first meeting it got one
troublesome matter off its hands by dele
gating to Andrew Donovan who was ap
pointed Superintendent or Streets, the
authority to employ all of the temporary
employes connected with his department.
The board has given the matter into the
hands of Mr. Donovan completely, and It
la likely that for some days to come he
will be kept almost as busy as the Civil
Service Commission.
MANY FIREMEN ARE
TO BE DISCHARGED
The new Board of Fire Commissioners
was busy all day yesterday going through
the personnel of the department. The ob
ject is to pick out 150 names for dismissal,
in accordance with the provisions of the
charter, which reduces the working staff
by that number. It was decided to hold
the regular meeting every Thursday
morning at 9 o'clock.

CIVIL SERVICE BOARD
APPOINTS A SECRETARY
The rivil Service Comm!?sionor3 yester
day announced the appointment of Ktl
ward F. .Moran as pecrctary of the com
mission. Alopg with thirty-four appli
can*r. Mr. Moran underwent competitive
examination. lie and two of his competi
tors comprised the three highest in tnrÂ»
competition. Mr. Moran was appointed on
probation to serve fur s:x months. If llw
servire of half a year demonstrates his
ability and penernl titneps for the office
the Commissioners may elect him secre
tary for the full term. Mr. Moran is a
well-known ami capable newspaper man
of the Examiner staff.
The registering oÂ£ applicants for posi
tions was resumed yesterday morning at
the office in the City Hall, and the Ion?
line of willing workers had not sensibly
diminished when thÂ» office closed. At 4
o'clock there were 11:00 names liste.l for la
borers and an e<;un-l number for clerks ana
skilled laborers.
RECORDER GODCHAUX
ASKS FOR MORE CLERKS
Recorder Godchaux yesterday sent a
communication to the Board of Super
visors, stating that with the staff ailowad
him by the charter it will be impossible
satisfactorily to conduct the business of
his office. Godchaux urges that he be
granted authority by the board to employ
two janitors, who will be under his con
trol and not subject to tho head janitor
of the City Hall. He al.Â«o asks for a mort
gage clerk and two index clerks.
OU3 cases, the same as other cases, by
order of Captain Seymour, and the ar
resting officers had to be present In court
to testify and to swear to the complaint
in each case.
Captain Seymour announced yesterday
that no more "O. R.s" would be recog
nized at the City Prison or any of the
police stations, as the charter specifically
says that defendants must put up cash
or bonds for their releases. There is
nothing, he contends, in the charter giv
ing Judges power to release a prisoner on
his or her own recognizance. He was
backed up in his contention by District
Attorney Byington. The Police Judges have
not officially discussed the question yet,
but will probably do so to-day, when they
will meet to draw lots for the long and
short terms. Two of them say Captain
Seymour is wrong and they hint that If
their orders of release are not recognized
by the City Prison officials the captain
may find himself in contempt of court.
SUPERVISORS' COMMITTEES
BEGIN ACTIVE WORK
The Printing Committee of the Board of
Supervisors held Its first meeting yester
day morning, with Chairman James Booth
and Supervisor John Connor present.
Requisitions for stationery and printing
were received from four offices and Chief
Deputy Assessor Ginty, Deputy Tax Col
lector J. XV. McCabe, Recorder Godchaux
and Deputy County Clerk Goddard ad
dressed the committee In regard to the
urgent need for supplies of all descrip
tions. As all stationery and printing un
der the charter must be furnished by con
tract, the officials were directed 'to make
separate lists of the two Items, so that
bids may be. invited. There Is now about
$6000 available for the purpose and the
articles called for will cost at least $1000.
In the afternoon the Joint committee,
consisting of the members of the Finance
and Judiciary Committee appointed at the
last meeting to investigate the needs of
the office in the matter of clerk hire, met
In executive session. A list of the present
employes was canvassed, but the decision
arrived at will not be made public until
the next meeting of the board.
m
NEW PRECINCT PLAN
TO BE INTRODUCED
The first serious work of the Board of
Election Commissioners will be the re
precJnctlng of the city. According to th*
charter a precinct system must bo estab
lished which will have an approximately
equal number of voters In the sev-eral
precincts.
Some members of the new commission
announced yesterday that they would
soon meet to perform this duty. It was
seen that in some precincts there were as
few as fifty voters, in others as many as
300. On the water front the voting popu
lation has become thinner, while in the
Western Addition It has increased with
great rapidity.
To fit the new conditions an entirely new
system and plan will be prepared. The
Election Commissioners are vested with
an unrestricted authority and right to
settle this mat>er and before many weeks
several schemes of preclncting will be
advanced.
GRAND JURY ASKED TO
BRING TWO INDICTMENTS
Former Chief Deputy Tax Collector
Hagan has brought the cases of James
Wiseman and Hiram. Goldstein to the at
tention of the new Grand Jury and re
quests that they.be indicted for perjury.
A few days ago Wiseman and Goldstein
made affidavit to the effect that Sheehan
and Hagan had filed, fraudulent salary de
mands in the name of Ben Chapman. It
was alleged that Sheehan and Hagan had
cashed a salary demand in the name of
Chapman in April, while, in fact. Chap
man did not become an employe until De
cember last.
Hagan claims that the charges are falsa
and says that they were brought with the
intention of besmirching the reputation of
Sheehan and himself by Goldstein and
Wiseman, who are discharged employes.

Picked Nines Engage fn a
Great Indoor Con
test.
Only six innings of indoor baseball were
played last night at the Olympic Club,
but In that period more noise was made
than is generally heard in a boiler foun
dry. The game was arranged by Man
ager A. S. Stone, who. In a moment of
weakness, consented to act as umpire.
Before the first Inning was half over he
wished he hadn't, but, like a plucky man,
he stayed with the game.
The contest was between two pick
nines, from which a team will be chosen
to represent the club In the tournament
which opens next month. Fred Butz act
ed as captain for the "Howlers" and W.
M. Cartwright acted in the same capac
ity for the "Kickers." Both took advan
tage of their exalted positions to shine
in the pitcher's box and also lead the
heated discussions on disputed plays.
The spectators were treated to fun and
some excellent playing.
At the close of the sixth inning the
score was tied with 17 runs for each side,
and the captains consented to call the
game a draw. Throughout the contest
the play was fast and mil of excitement.
The players worked like beavers. Cap
tain Jones. In his effort to put out Fred
Butz at the plate, was thrown off his
feet and had to retire from the contest.
Following is the line-up of the teams
and the number of runs scored by each

OLINTHUS
SEEMED TO
HAVE SCORED
Corrigan's St. Casimir Given
the Decision Over the
Outsider.
From every point of vantage within
close proximity to the wire, and from the
press stand, which affords an unobstruct
ed view. It looked as If Olinthus won the
last race at Tanforan yesterday by a
head, but the Judges saw differently, giv
ing It to Corrigan's St. Caslmir. The
scratching blank had shortened the field
to three horses. Frank Bell ruled a
1 to 2 favorite, with the educated
and fashionable money going In on the
Corrlgan entry, cutting his odds from 5
to 2 to 9 to 6. Bell was apparently short,
for a furlong from home, with St. Casimlr
at his side, he looked badly distressed.
About this time T. Walsh on Olintbua
came fast next the rail and in a furious
drive appeared to have beaten the Cont
gan horse. When the numbers were
Hashed St. Caslmir was placed first.
Frank Bell second and Olfnthua third.
Later thts order was changed, Olinthus
exchanging places with Bell.
Very little had been done with the track,
which was Blow and apparently dead. Fa
vorites took three purses.
Corrigan's Geyser defeated Bannockburn
in the seven-furlong run after the latter
had been given fully four lengths the
worst of the start. Geyser stumbled on
the backstretch. himself enjoying none too
pleasant a trip. Spencer, however, rode
him in magnificent fashion, beating out
Schreiber's horse half a length.
After the public had become thoroughly
disgusted with Braw Lass, the mare went
out and won the opening sprint at ortds
of 6 and 7 to 1. Spencer had the mount,
and after Bhowing first most of the dis
tance downed the favorite. First Shot, a
nose. Miss Soak, a 15 to 1 shot run into
the show. Isaline, the second choice,
never had a chance after the start.
The cheap mile selling run which fol
lowed was only a gallop for Toribio,
backed from threes to 9 to 6 favoritism.
The entire bunch starting were a rapg-'d,
hungry looking set of skates, and Rixford
staggered in second, a head before dilap
idated old Dolore.
"Long Shot" Conley landed the third
purse with Tirade, which horse closed a
slight favorite over Sardonic. Conley and
his mount were bumped around the first
turn by Ballsta, and the colored rider laid
away in third place to the stretch. Here
he moved up, and In a drive downed Sar
donic half a length. Whaleback showed
considerable speed, finishing a close third.
Midian was played for a good thing to
won the fifth event, at a mile, but after
leading to the: stretch he blew up. Del
Paso, the second choice, then won clevetly
from Tom Cromwell, a 10 to 1 shot.
FLYCASTERS
OPEN THEIR
NEW SEASON
They Prepare for Sport on
Stow Lake With Rod
and Reel.
The first mooting of the members of San
Francisco Flycasting Club for this year
was held last night and, as is customary,
assumed the form of a duck dinner, the
ducks being the gift of Charming Mans
field and some of his Napa friends. Tho
attendance was unusually large, and a
marked feature was the enthusiasm dis
played by the members in all matters
pertaining to the club. It was taken to
Indicate that the season to come will see
more interest shown in the sport and a
higher development in the gentle art.
The members and their guests were en
tertained last night by Ben Tarbox,
Frank W. Thompson, Charles Ma,yer Jr.,
a zither soloist who was encored repeat
edly for his masterly handling of the
quaint old German instrument, John Siebe
Jr., Fred Surryhne and others. Fish
Commissioner Alexander Vogelsang told
of his travels in the East. He suffered
from the wintry blasts and congratulated
his auditors upon their residence in this

COLONEL FREEMAN TO
LEAVE ON THE TARTAR
MAJOR COVTLES NOW IN COM
MAND AT THE PRESIDIO.
The transport Tartar, to sail to-< Jay, will
take Colonel IL B. Freeman of the
Twenty-fourth Infantry as one of her
passengers. He will be In command of
the detachment of troops on board dur
ing the voyage and upon his arrival he
will Join his regiment on the firing line
at once. The departure of Colonel Free
man for the Philippines has occasioned
the expression of many regrets, both from
DRS. PAYNE AND
BARBAT TALKED
WITH THE MAYOR
Coffey and Lawlor Know
Now Why There Was
No Contest.
Health Officer Lawlor and Dr. W. B.
Coffer of the old Board of Health have
discovered why Drs. Barbat and Payne
fell down on Monday and gave over their
offices without contest to the charter
board. If reports be true, and there Is
every evidence in their support, it waa a
cas-e of Phelan with Barbat and a case of
father-in-law and Phtlan with Payne.
LJarbat is the family physician of Dan
M. Burns and was appointed to the Board
of Health by Governor Ga.ge at Burns' in
stance. When two weeks ago the colonel
ordered the board to prepare to contest
that section of the charter which took
local health regulations out of the Juris
diction of the *sta.te and placed them un
der that of the city. Barbat was first to
sound the slogan a.nd neglected his medi
cal practice in order to make the light a
warm one. Toward the last he fairly
bristled with points of law and bubbled
â¢with determination to hold on to the
Health Office if he had to barricade the
door and do it a la Sheehan. He bristled
up to 11 o'clock Monday, when Secretary
Carroll suggested that he descend in
force upon the Mayor's office and bluff
the executive out of his determination to
unseat the board with the aid of tho po
lice.
Although Phelan had acknowledged
privately that he was afraid the old
board could not be unseated for Eix
months at least, publicly he had declared
he would seat the new officials If he had
to use the police in doing it His bluff
â¢was taken s*eriou?ly by the old members
and they had made all sorts of plans to
circumvent him. Barbat came on the
Fcne Monday morning breathing several
different temperatures of Indignation and
h*> was at once selected as the agent of
annihilation. He swooped down on the
Mayor's otjices prepared to have it all
ovpt and the floor cleaned up within five
minutes, but as a tirst setback he was
piven twenty minutes in the waltlng-
room to cool off and wait until his Honor
had pot through with other people.
Dr. Payne came in next, looking wor
ried, but not at all fierce. It took the
NEW BOARD OF
HEALTH SWINGS
ITS LITTLE AX
It Abolishes Quarantine
and the Pure Food
Departments,
The new Board of Health yesterday
abolished j the quarantine and pure food
departments, and as a consequence the
services of fifteen employes were dis
pensed with and a caving of nearly $1400
a month effected. Whether the wave of
economy which has so suddenly struck
the guardians of the city's health is
merely temporary and a preliminary move
to reappoint individuals of their own polit
ical preference remains to be seen.
A meeting of the board was to have
been held at 12 o'clock, but only Drs. Wil
liamson, Baum and Bazet put in an ap
pearance. Acting Chief of Police Biggy
and Colonel Mendell, president of the
Board of Public Works, who are ex-ofncio
members of tho Health Board, were also
present, but left to attend other official
business.
The three members of the board, how
ever, held an informal star chamber aes
sion, and the result of their secret delib
erations was made known when Dr. Wil
liamson hurriedly came out from the con
ference and addressed the following com
munication to Health Officer O'Brien by
which the quarantine service was abol
ished:
A. P. O'Brien, M.D.. Health Officer: Tou axe
hereby authorized to take the necessary steps
to close down the quarantine department, for
merly operating under the Jurisdiction of the
Board of Health. I understand that the
Quarantine Officer and crew are still occupy
ing their positions. You will, therefore, advise
the afore-mentloned persons of the Issuance of
this order, and at the same time take the
necessary steps to provide for the care of the
tug until such time as it may be properly dis
posed of. Yours truly,
JOHN M. WILLIAMSON,
President of the Board of Health.
In taking this action the local board
has tacitly delegated its powers to the
Federal quarantine officials, with which
the old board had clashed on several oc
casions. Mayor Phelan, in fact, informed
the old board when the members were
considering the question of holding on to
their offices that the quarantine was
plainly a national affair.
Those who are affected by the board's
action are Quarantine Officer I. E. Cohen,
$150 a month; P. McQowan, captain of the
launch Governor Perkins, $120; R. J. Cous
ins, engineer, $100; P. Hammond, deck
hand, f75, and J. S. Wilklns, messenger,
$70 a month. The deckhand may be re
tained to care for the launch until some
arrangements can be made for its dis
posal.
The order to Health Officer O'Brien re
garding the food department was very
brief and to the point, and simply in
structed him to notify the present force
of food Inspectors that their services
would no longer be required. Those who
lost their positions are Chief Inspector
Devoto, who received $20) a month, and
the following assistants at $75 a month
each: B. M. Jones, O. H. Ryan, O. P.
Murray, J. J. Sullivan, M. Collins, B. O.
Hornleln, Thomas Hess, D. Jacobi and L.
W. Hollingsworth.
The new charter provides that all police
men shall act as health inspectors, and it
is understood that the new board intends
to appoint physicians as food inspectors.
The. market Inspector will be a veterinary
surgeon, and it is said that present Veteri
narian O'Rourke stands a splendid chance
for the place.
POLICE JUDGES MAY

SCHOOL BOARD
CANNOT AGREE
UPON SALARIES
Denman and Mrs. Kin
caid Accused of Doing
Politics.
ThÂ» new Board of Education has not
yet fixed the amount of salary t<> be paid
to the deputies to be appointed by Super
intendent Webster, and Webster ptie*a
to his determination to appoint no assist
ants until the salary is fixed at the figure
he dictates. Behind it all. it is said, is
Mrs. Mary Kincaid's maiden attempt at
politics and the desire of Director Den
man to have appointed a deputy of his
own selection. According to a number of
prominent teachers in the department,
who have lined up on the Superintendent's
end of the fight. Mrs. Kincaid objects to
I* A. Jordan and Denman objects to W.
A. Kingsbury. to both of whom Webster
has proffered positions. â¢ '
For Jordan's place Mrs. Kincaid ha* a
candidate of her own and Denman has one
for the Job Kingsbury wants to fall into,
and they have both declined to fix the
salary at a figure higher than $15*) per
month until Webster agrees to appoint
their candidates. Webster declares that
he will make no appointments unless the
salary is fixed at $250 and says even that
figure is too low a price to put upon the
ability that will be required in his depu
ties. The question was broached asain
yesterday when the board came together
in regular meeting, but no agreement was
arrived at and matters are the same as
when the controversy started.
At yesterday's meeting little was accom
plished other than the declaring vacant a
number of positions in the office and
storeroom. The positions of four assist
ant secretaries, two messengers and the
storekeeper were declared vacant after
the 13th of the month and the offlce9 of
inspector and assistant Inspector of build-
Ings were abolished.
R. P. Hooe, who was an assistant secre
tary under the Waller board, waa ap
pointed assistant secretary; Charles He-
Auliffe was made storekeeper at a salary
of $100 per month: P. L. Weaver, assist
ant secretary, at a salary of $75 per
month, and J. J. O'Brien, messenger, at a
salary of $75 per month. The president of
the board was authorized to arrange for
such Janitorial service as will be needed
before the Board of Public Works takes
necessary action to fill the place. The
rules of 1596. with the amendments of ISD9.
were adopted for temporary use, but will
be replaced with something entirely new
and in keeping with the new order of
things as soon as the board can get down
to proper Â¦working ord^r.
Superintendent \Vcbstcr appeared before
the board to discuss the auction of
finances and In the course of his talk re
ported that State Controller Colpan had
submitted his statement to the Auditor
and that the share of school moneys due
San Francisco amounted to $330,055. That
amount, he said, was nearly $75,000 in ex
cess of the sum usually apportioned be
cause of the collection and distribution of
moneys under -the inheritance tax. % Mr.
Webster stated that although the Con
troller had included the inheritance col
lections in this year's funds, it was the
opinion of himself and the Auditor that
that sum could be applied to the unpaid
teachers' salarips of November and De
cember, IS9S, and that the Auditor would
so make the apportionments. The amount
is sufficient to pay a dividend of 35 cents
on the dollar. The board adjourned to
meet again on Friday afternoon.

A PROSPECTIVE DEFICIT
IN THE CITY'S FUNDS
The startling announcement was made
yesterday afternoon by Auditor "Wc!ls
that there Â¦will In all likelihood be a lar?e
deficit in the municipal funds by May 1
next on account of a provision in the
charter which requires the transfer of
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALT,, WEDNESDAY, JAJSUARY 10, 1900.
IT IS evident that the first couple of. weeks of charter govern
ment is to be given over to house-cleaning and getting set
tled in new quarters. Nearly all of the new, commissions held
meetings yesterday, but few of them transacted any business
other than that of urgent necessity. The Board of Public Works
met in the morning and continued its session into, the after
noon, but the only matter of importance discussed was the thor
ough cleaning of the City Hall and the regulation of the jani
torial service in such a way that it will be of some practical use
and not purely a tax-consuming organization.
The Board of Health has twice atempted to straighten out
its patronage tangle and get its office affairs working in an even
groove, but so far no quorjm has been present at any one time,
and another try at it will be made at 9:30 o'clock this morning.
The Civil Service Commission opened up early in the day, and
its clerks were kept busy filing the applications of those who as
pire to one or another of the hundreds of positions which are to
be filled at the end of the present sixty days.
After a score of deputies and upholsterers had got through
with Tax Collector Scott's office there were few traces left of the
scrimmage that occurred when Mr. Scott inducted himself into
office, and his clerks are peaceably at work experting the books
left behind by Sheehan. The different commissions will meet
nearly every day during the week, and the Supervisors will go
on regularly with committee work.

AN AWKWARD FIX.
Miss Nell Carter Must Get Possession
of a Poodle Dog or Lose a
Husband.
Mlfs Nell Carter, 211 Leavenworth street,
is afraid that if she does not get posses
sion of a Chinese poodle dog she will lose
a husband. To save her from such a dis
aster she secured a search warrant from
Judge Fritz yesterday to secure posses
sion of the pet.
Miss Carter said that her sweetheart,
who had been a soldier, after returning
from Manila prc-f ented her with the poodle
dog. As her landlady would not allow a
dog on the premises, she gave it to a.
friend. Mrs. Fowler. 711 Post street, to
keep till she could claim it. Her soldier
lover is now in Los Angeles and has wrli
ten her to come along and get married,
but to be sure and bring the poodle Jo#.
Miss Carter says she made a demand
upon Mrs. Fowler for the dog, but that
lady refused to give It up, as she had
taken quite a fancy to It.

SAN PABLO GIRL NOT
GUILTY OF BURGLARY
MISS MARY E. BOWEN, THE VICTIM OF A CONSPIRACY.
MISS MART E. BOTVEN of San Pablo, who when arrested on a charge
of burglary at the Burlington Hotel wished to be known at the City
Prison as "Mary Brown," was honoraby dismissed from the cus
tody of the court yester-iiy by Police Judge Conlan. H. M. Duncan,
her prosecutor, failed tc appear, having left the State in fear of <vi
ordeal on the witness stand.
The young lady, heavily veiled, accompanied by her mother, was in court.
When asked hÂ«Â»r true name she was saved from answering by Attorney Quin
lan. who said "Mary Brown."
"This is a case that should not pnss without a few words from the bench."
paid Judge Conlar.. "No one regrets more than I do that the prosecuting wit
r.e-sp. Duncan, Is not here. I believe this arrest of a respectable young woman
on a charge cf burglary to have been a scheme, or perhaps the mean work of
a drunken man. Instead of her having robbed anybody, or attempted to do
f". I understand she was herself robbed. This fellow Duncan, whoever he is.
came here to swear to a complaint, and slunk away. It is very plain that h!s
motive was not to protect society by securing the punishment of a criminal.
but something else. If he were here lam of the opinion that he would find
himself the party charged, with f his young Sady as his accuser. She has al
ready been j-Ã¼bjected to a great deal of undeserved humiliation, and I shall or
der the ense to be dismissed."
H. M. Duncan, who caused Mi?* Bowen's arrest, registered at the Palac
Hotel a few days before he went for a night to the Burlington. He asked for
1 the cheapest room in the house, ar.d the Palace bellboy who showed him to
his room saw no evidence of the JSV) diamond ring that he professed to have
lost.
Attorney Rose says that Durean has gone East, and asserts positively
that the affair was a scheme to tret money out of Miss Bowen's guardian. W.

but the Superior .court of Napa conclud- I
ed that he was still of unsound mind, j
and he was sent back to the Napa Asy- |
lurn. Another effort is now being made
Jn the same direction through the Su
preme Court.
Dr. A. M. Gardner, superintendent of i
the hospital, t^stif.f-d yesterday that it j
is his opinion that Buchanan is insane,
and that there is no chance of his re- i
co very of reason. In this he disagrees ;
â¢with his subordinate, *-r. Dozicr. who Is |
believed by many to be working for the !
position ol his superior. If rhe court de- *
cidc-s that Buchanan is pane it is likr-Iy i
that Dr. Dozicr will get the place, which i
Governor Gape is said to b<=> only too anx- j
lous to give him. Gage has no love for '
Pr. Gardner and would likÂ»- to p-*>t some ]
k;r.d of a "hook" on him so as to have j
en fxruff for ousting him from office. ]
If Buchanan's sanity could be establish- i
t-d pr<jÂ«-f'?dir.RP could be brought against ;
Dr. Gardner lor williully holding a sane j
man In tho hospital. Th*-re are plenty I
who believe that Car" is one of the fac
tors behind the fight to secure Buchanan's
r^leasf fr<im the asylum.
During the argument yesterday an in
cident not wholly devoid of humor oc
curred. Attorney General Tirey L. Ford.
erp*"'arinjr as representative of the State,
rr.ade a strong plea, in which he conten.l
*<i that Buchanan's mental condition had
elready been passed up r m by experts and
a Superior Court Judge and it was found
that the man was insane. Continuing
Mr. Ford *aid:
This court, however, has undertaken
to examine anew thiÂ» Question of fact.
a.nd the proceedings thus far have
demonstrated the utter futility of such
attempted investigation. Th<> highest
judicial tribunal of a sovereign State,
created for tho review of the judg
ments and orders of inferiors courts
and invested with plenary power for
the correction of legal mistakes and '
Judicial errors, is impotent to secure
th* needed testimony for the deter
mination of disputed questions of fact.
Nor is It strange that this is so. This
court is an appellate and not a trial
court. It deals with questions of law
and not of fact. No provision has been
made by the law-making power of the
State for the means necessary to se
cure the needed testimony upon which
this court may base correct conclu
sions In this proceeding. We are,
therefore, in the anomaJous position
of being practically limited by the will
and pleasure of counsel for petitioner
in the production of testimony on be
half of respondent. And pven the tes
timony which we arf thus permitted
to introduce rome? in a mangled and
incomplete form, with the most of it
still unread to the court.
Mr. Ford, while using good old Knglish
language "as she is spoke." unconscious
ly put his foot In it. The court, and Chief
Justice Beatty especially, failed to grasp
th<> meaning of the rorcgoing remarks
and was much offended. The Attorney
General hastened to explain that he
rmant no disrespect to the court. He
had not reflected upon the mental caliber
of the court and their "inability" ana
"impotency" was statutory and not per
sonal. This assurance mollified the prin
cipal members of the court, who had been
more sensitive than comprehending in the
matter of Mr. Fora's exposition of the
law and the farts.
WILL VISIT CITY BANKS
Finance Committee of California
Water and Forest Association to
Begin Work Locally Soon.
The finance committee of the California
Water and Forest Association will besin
to make a canvass for funds among the
San Francisco banks by the last of the
present week.' All that they are waiting
for is the arrival of a member of the com
mittee from Fresno, who is expected to be
here in a day or two. Great hope is en
tertained among the members of the com
mittee that the banks of the city will re
spond liberally, because the banks are
heavy holders of real estate In the sec
tions where an exceptionally dry year is
pure to bring large loss. It has been fig
ured out that one dry year caused a lcs
nt j-Ti.orvi.noo t r the San Joaquin Valley,
where the holdings of several city banks
die extensive.
Responses have not been received from
the appeal of the flr.r.nrp committee to the
people in the interior, but word of progress
r>f the movement Is expectt-d daily. The
letters wr>nt out only last week, and the
bad wf-ather undoubtedly interfered with
work in the interior. The membership has
bÂ«Â»en considerably increased through the
efforts of the membership committee.

MBS. STREVINGER NEVER GOT
OVER HER LOSS.
Brooded Until Her Mind Gave Way
and Then Killed Herself by-
Inhaling Illuminating
Gas.
Mrs. Therese Strevinger, 70 years old,
committed suicide yesterday afternoon at
her residence, "3d Green street, by inhal
ing Illuminating gas through a rubber
tube.
The unfortunate woman's husband,
Frederick Strevinger, a well-known mu
sician, had left the house only a few mo
ments before to go to the Branch Public
Library on Powell street, and the woman
Inquired of Mrs. Leone, the landlady, if
her husband was out of the house. On
being answered in the affirmative Mrs.
Strevinger retired to her room. At 3:30
o'clock in the afternoon Mrs. Leone had
occasion to pass in front of Mrs. Strevln
ger's door. She detected the odor of il
luminating gas. She immediately gave
the alarm, the door was broken open and
the dead body of her locger was found
on the bed with one end of a rubber tube
in her mouth, the other end being at
tached to the gas fixtures. A physician
was called In. but he found that life was
extinct.
Mrs. Strevingrer Is said to have been
rendered insane by the act of a burglar
when she and her husband were on a
visit to Paris two years ago. They had
accumulated property worth a little more
than $20,000 and converted It into cur
rency, taking the money with them to
Paris. They had not been there a week
when a burglar entered their room and
stole the jxicketbook containing the
money which was under the pillow. They
returned to San Francisco practically
penniless and the husband began at the
foot of the ladder to work at his pro
fession of musician and music teacher to
earn a livelihood for himself and his wife.
She w~s heartbroken over their loss and
brooded over It so much that she became
a prey to melancholia. It was in one of
those fits undoubtedly that she took her
life. The deceased was a native of Al
sace.
Deputy Coroner McCormlck removed
the body to the Morgue.

1-2 1-2THE TAINT OF IMPERIALISM.
GENERAL OTIS' order forbidding any person
connected with the military or the civil ser
vice in the Philippines to accept gifts from
inferiors is an official notice of the development
among our officials in those islands of one of the
worst features of imperialism â that of accepting
bribes from the people of the subject race. A prac
tice which begins by the acceptance of money from
the conquered will soon become a practice of extort
ing money, and by swift steps will advance to an evil
of portentous magnitude.
In his order General Otis says of these alleged
cases of bribe-taking: "It is reported that passes are
obtained and transferred for a money consideration;
that compensation is made for transportation of per
sons and things on public conveyances or convey
ances controlled by the public to officials unauthor
ized to receive it and for their own benefit, and that
contributions are solicited, if not exacted, and at any
I rate received from subordinates for the purchase of
present to superiors."
It is to be noted that while the general speaks of
the acceptance of gifts or bribes as offenses not yet
The servant girl problem may find its solution in
Kansas City, for a movement has been started there
to found a $200,000 college to train young women in
the domestic arts. When a girl can graduate her way
into a kitchen by taking a diploma perhaps she will
take more interest in the profession and attend to its
duties better.
It is announced that even the chief civil service
examiner has been "slated" for his position by Mayor
Phelan. This is a suggestively familiar way in which
to inaugurate a great policy of reform. New San
Francisco is beginning to adopt suspiciously the
methods of the old.
A few days ago it was suggested that the Board of
Public Works ought to remodel the interior of the
City Hall. A few more scenes such as that enacted
in the Tax Collector's office would suggest the pro
priety, of making the building a fortress.
The fellow who tried to steal the Morgue wagon
as the last spoil of expiring authority must feel a cer
tain distinction of being the most unique spoilsman
in the history of local politics.
It is said that General Buller has his hands full.
The correspondents fail to add that the general can
conceive of no way in which to drop anything.
Carter Harrison refuses to be any longer the Aguin
aldo of the Democratic party of Chicago. At any
rate, he refuses to run for re-election,

SEIZURE ON THE HIGH S EAS.
OUR last war with Great Britain was fought on
our protest against her right to seize and
search the ships of a neutral on the high seas.
The war ended with the treaty of Ghent, in which its
cause was not referred to at all. The struggle went
against us on land, with the single exception of the
battle of New Orleans, which was fought after peace
was declared. On the water the honors were de
cidedly with us, and as between the two nations the
point was settled. We violated that tacit settlement,
however, by the search of a British ship and the
seizure of Mason and Slidell, the Confederate envoys,
during our Civil War. England at once denied our
right to search a neutral for contraband persons or
property, and Mr. Seward wisely conceded the point
and surrendered the two envoys to the British flag.
Since that time no case has arisen until now. Eng
land reverses herself in the Mason-Slidell case and
claims the very right which she denied to us. Her
seizure of German mail steamers at Aden and ap
proaching Delagoa Bay, on the theory that property
or passengers on board may enter belligerent terri
tory, is utterly insufferable from any view of interna
tional right. It is doing exactly what we whipped her
for in 1812, and it remains to be seen whether the rest
of the world, including our own Government, will
permit it.
Great Britain is also assuming the right to partially
blockade a neutral port by shutting the ships of neu
trals out of Delagoa Bay. She has seized three car
goes of American flour, in neutral bottoms, on their
way to that neutral port, assigning as her excuse that
the flour may reach the Boers. When the wheat was
growing in the field of Dakota there was the same
possibility that it would reach the Boers, and she had
just as much right to send an army over the Canadian
border to burn it in the stack as to confiscate it in
neutral bottoms en route to a neutral port.
An unavoidable duty is put upon our Government
by these events. It is not only to demand payment
for the property of our citizens, scired piratically, but
to join the other nations in a protest against this
British bullying of neutrals, and if she refuse to de
sist declare war upon her, as Madison and our Con
gress did in 1812 and for the same cause exact!}'.
It is true that the Spanish war and its collateral
effects have given us a small taste of the sweets of
pillage and piracy, but the intoxication is far from
affecting the majority of our people, whose pa
triotic inter* st it is to resent and resist the intoler
able pretensions of Great Britain.
Under the rule she is attempting to establish by
â¢ the acts' at Aden and Delagoa Bay all she has to do
I is to provoke a war with some weak country and then
! piratically loot the commerce of the neutral world on
the high seas. Such a policy makes Captain Kidd's
memory respectable, and, while piracy is a crime
visited by the death penalty in the individual, puts it
among the virtues when committed by a nation.
It iÂ« well for France, Russia, Germany and Austria
to know that the people of the United States will not
; permit their Government to even negatively sup
port this British piracy. And it will be well for our
I Government to know that there are serious accidents
i ahead for American public men who go back on the
i cause for which we fought in 1812.

The Chilean ship Hindostan, which put
in here In distress last Monday, will prob- i
ably have to discharge and go on the I
drydock. She was caught in a heavy
southeaster soon after leaving Puget
Sound and was badly strained. The
water began to pour In and the crew
was called to the pumps. Steam was got
on the donkey boiler, the windmill was
put In working order and a constant
stream of water was kept pouring over
the sides. As fast aa the water was
pumped out, however, the faster It came
in through the open seams. Finding that
the leak was beyond his control, Captain
Walsh decided to put into San Francisco.
The Hindostan was on her way -from
Puget Sound to Valparaiso with a load
of lumber.
An examination of the Hindostan was
made yesterday by the underwriters.

the men have to keep the pumps going
all the time to prevent the ship from be
coming waterlogged. At first it was
thought that by discharging the deckload
the vessel would be lightened enough to
reach the leak, but as soon as the Board
of Survey got through It was decided to
discharge the entire cargo and dock the
vessel.
The Hindostan Is one of the old timers,
having been built in Nova Scotia in 1874.
She is still a good, stout ship, but during
the heavy weather her seams must all
have opened up and she will now have
to be recalked throughout before she can
proceed.
The sealing fleet has made a good start
having taken more skins at this time
than the crew of the Geneva had at the

sealers wish to thank Captain Jepson of
the steamer Queen and Captain Mcln
tyre of the collier Bristol for newspapers
received. On the way up and down the
coast both masters* go out of their way
to drop a coal oil can full of newspapers
overboard so that they can be picked up
by the sealers.

THE COLLAPSE OF POPULISM.
SEXATOR KYLE of South Dakota, who has
been classed in the Congressional Directory as
an "independent," and who in the past has
acted with the Populists, has now announced himself
as a straight-out Republican. He is quoted as
ing said recently: "Though I am a bimetallism and
have been so from conscientious convictions for
twenty-five years, I would rather take the most un
diluted gold standard than to accept bimetallism with
! the ingredients of radicnl socialism that are now asso
ciated with it."
The Senator's statement directs attention to the
trend of the free silver agitators toward something
like extreme, socialism. The fusion of Democracy
vith Populism resulted in producing a combination
which represents and- exaggerates the worst features
lof both. Conservative Democrats have long since re
pudiated the Bryan party which masquerades as
Democracy, and now the more intelligent of the
Populists and bimetallists are imitating their example.
In commenting upon the^ situation in his State the
Senator said: "It is probable that the socialists, the
! radical Populists and the radical Democrats will get
I together and operate under the name of the reform
i p::rty. In the election last fall there was no organized
Democratic party and no Democratic ticket. The
name was completely obliterated, and yet it was not
so very long ago that the Democrats cast 27,000 votes
in my State. This conglomerated party never can
win. The present Populist Governor was elected by
a bare majority of 300, although previously the Popu
lists had several thousand majority. In the last elec
tion the Republicans, without money and without a
I struggle, won by nearly 7000. In the Presidential
i campaign next year South Dakota will go for Me-
I Kinley by from 10,000 to 15,000. The socialistic ten
dencies of the third party people and the prosperity
which is being enjoyed by the South Dakota farmers
j have sounded the death knell of the old movement."
The situation in the country at large is not essen
! tially different from that in South Dakota. The an
| tagonism which the Republican party will have to
! meet this fall will be made up of radicals of all kinds â
j Democrats, Populists and socialists. It will be in no
i true sense a Democratic party, nor even a Populist
1 party. It will have no issue except that which the
socialists may furnish it, for it is now clear that qucs
j tions of tariff and finance are settled, and that it will
jbe impossible to make a partisan issue out of
! problems arising from trusts or imperialism. Bryan
ism will, in fact, represent nothing but discontent and
will have no leadership better than that of Bryan him
self, supported by Altgeld, Debs and other agitators
of that kind.
THE MAYOR'S MESSAGES
\A AIOR PIIELAN'S message is in the nature
/ \ of a running commentary on the new charter,
** *in the course of which he explains to the Su
pervisors what they can do and what they must leave
to others. It is long, and may be learned, but it is
rot lucid, ar.d it is doubtful if the Supervisors, whom
the Mayor appears to regard as a kindergarten class,
hare derived much benefit from it.
Concerning the powers vested in himself as chief
executive of the city Mr. Phelan says: "The Mayor
hat become the executive and administrator and is
responsible for the execution of the laws and for the
wise aad economical expenditure of public money
throt:ph various boards and commissions. The Com
missioners are responsible to him and he is respon
sible to the people. Therefore there should be loyal
co-operation between the two branches of the govern
ment and between the commissions and the Mayor.
The commissions have to express in their public ac
tions the policy for which the Mayor stands."
- a plain declaration that under the new char
ter t Mayor is the government and the Commis
*i<>:iers are appointed solely to carry out his policy.
Such pledges as he may have made in the campaign
nust be fulfilled by the Commissioners. The Mayor
ha* appointed them for that purpose. Thus, accord
ing to the Phelan construction of the charter, those
boards, of which the people have had such high ex
pectations, are not to be independent bodies sen-ing
the welfare of the municipality, but merely a lot of
subordinates serving the Mayor.
Such being the case, the office of District Attorney
becomes a very important office indeed, since upon
that official is imposed the duty of prosecuting of
fenders against the purity of elections law. He is the
only officer who can call the Mayor to account if his
"policy" &hould be found to embrace the disposal of
too many offices promised in violation of law dur
ing the campaign for the sake of getting votes.
There is nothing like making a test of all the powers
of the new government at the start, and the District
.Attorney, therefore, 1 should take note of the Mayor's
"office-distributing policy at once.
Among the defects of the charter the Mayor notes
â¢what he calls "slight disconnection between the duties
of the Supervisors and the duties of the Assessor,"
due to the fact that the Supervisors are required
to make the tax levy not later than the last Monday
In June, while the Assessor is required to turn over
his assessment roll to the Supervisors on the first
Monday in July. Thus the board in acting upon the
â¢ tax levy will have no official information of what the
assessment for the year is gotog to be. That defect
the Mayor hopes to overcome by inducing the Asses
sor to make an "unofficial" statement of the approxi
mate assessment. It is an awkward method of doing
business, but perhaps it can be made to work until
an amendment can be effected.
The decision of the Supreme Court that the Board
of Health may appoint subordinates irrespective of
the appropriation for its maintenance, and that the
subordinates rrvst be paid out of the treasury, gives
to that, and by parity of reasoning to certain other
hoards, a power which the Mayor regard* as "illogical
and vicious." Nor is his view in that respect to be dis
putrd, for it is clear that if a board can at will under
take expenditures in excess of the appropriations
granted there will be very little chance for the en
forcement of economy.
An excellent point is made in the statement:
"There seems to be no authority under the charter to
fix telephone rates, and therefore it is the duty of the
board to see that the companies pay taxes in p-o
portion to the value of their property." The out
going board <!id what it could in that direction by
passing to print a resolution imposing taxes upon
telephone machines, and the new board should enact
the resolution without delay.
Of the closing suggestion of the Mayor that the
city should have a flag there will be much said as
soon as the work of designing one begins. If other
cities have a flag San Francisco should have one.
We have no design of our own to offer, but whatever
is accepted must be neat, not gaudy.
COMMERCIAL MUSEUMS.
PROFESSOR GEORGE DAVIDSON'S etate
ment concerning the work achieved by the
Commercial Museum in Philadelphia and the
advantages which a similar museum in San Francisco
would confer upon the merchants and manufacturers
of the Pacific Coast will have the effect of reviving
public interest in the subject, and, it is to be hoped,
will stimulate the efforts of those having in charge
the enterprise of providing such a museum.
What Professor Davidson says of the benefits
accruing from the Philadelphia museum confirm the
reports that have come to us from other sources.
That museum has but a short history, for it was de
veloped from gifts made to the city of Philadelphia
of exhibits of various countries at the Chicago ex
position in 1893, but it has become in that brief period
one of the most notable institutions in the United
States. It has attracted the attention of merchants
and manufacturers of the entire commercial world
and has correspondents in every important trade cen
ter on the globe.
After a careful study of the working of the Phila
delphia museum and a consideration of the needs of
commerce on the coast. Professor Davidson main
tains that such an institution in San Francisco is an
almost imperative requirement of the timj. He is
quoted as saying:
"It would be the broadest, easiest and, in reality,
the cheapest means of giving aid and information to
c\<ry industry in the Pacific States â information that
cÂ«n be gotten in no other manner. There never was
a more opportune time in our Pacific Coast history
when so many influences conspire to make the realiza
tion of a great commerce possible. The acquisition
of new countries through the Pacific and the certain
development of the commerce of the United States
among them and the other tropical islands and in
the countries bordering on the southern and eastern
ccasts of Asia present unique conditions. In 1897
the traffic of the coasts of Asia and of Oceanica
amounted to $2,127,000,000, of which the United States
shared to the amount of only $149,000,000, or 7 per
cent."
It has been repeatedly stated that if a commercial
museum be established here the Philadelphia museum
will co-operate with it and will furnish out of its sur
plus of exhibits a nucleus around which to build up a
tine array of exhibits in this city. Such assurances
afford all the encouragement we ought to require.
They render certain the usefulness of the museum as
soon as it is opened, for the Philadelphia co-operation
means that patrons and members of the local museum
will have the advantage of whatever information can
be given by the managers and the correspondents of
the Philadelphia institution.
The time is propitious for undertaking the founda
tion of the museum and it should not be long delayed.
The competition for the trade of the Orient is close
and keen. We should not neglect anything which
will help us to gain trade there. Our rivals in Great
Britain, Germany and Russia have long been studying
the demands of that market and if we would compete
with them on even terms we must be equally studious.
Let us then provide our city with a museum in which
the producer, the manufacturer and the merchant may
learn what articles are in demand in various parts
of the world and where are the best markets for his
goods.
proven, and is careful to refer to them as "alleged"
cases and as "reports," yet he intimates that enough
evidence exists to support a moral conviction that
some of them at least are true. Thus he declares:
"The commanding general is constrained to the belief
that these reports, which are in the nature of general
complaints and do not relate to specific offenses, have
a more or less substantial foundation. The evil, cor
rupting and far-reaching in its effects, appears to have
reached a stage which "renders its suppression with a
strong hand imperative. Commanding officers, heads
of departments and others exercising control are di
rected to lend their best endeavors to this end. They
will be held responsible, each within his proper
sphere, that all reports and allegations of offenses of
this nature are probed to the bottom and when found
to be supported by evidence that offenders are
brought to justice."
That an American general should have to issue an
order of that kind thus early in the stage of our ex
periment in governing subject races is a warning to
which the people should give " due heed. Bribe
taking has been common enough in our political life,
but it has ever been the belief of all that the officers
of our army are above such corruption. This official
order, which carries with it the announcement that
in the Philippines the army itself is falling from the
high standard of honor with which it has been cred
ited, is more depressing than would have been a re
port of defeat on the field of battle. A check to our
arms we could easily overcome, but it is a sad day
for the republic when a command from headquarters
is needed to warn civil and military officers on duty
among the subject people that the acceptance of
bribes or gifts from those whom they are appointed
to govern is not to be tolerated.
We have here one of the first proofs of the cor
rupting power ofimperialism. If the military admin
istration in the Philippines has been already tainted
by bribe-taking, what can we expect of any civil
administration we may establish there? The order of
General Otis will open the eyes of a great many peo
ple who have been willing to make the leap into im
perialism without looking ahead. It is significant
of what is likely to happen if we undertake a perma
nent government of millions of people of subject
races.

thanked Senator Depew for his gracious
words and said that he was overpowered
by this new proof of the gratitude of his
countrymen. To him the most pleasant
thing about It. and one that would make
him cherish it all the more, was the fact
that the children of the country were so

GIUSEPPE VERDI, THE WORLD'S COMPOSER.
T his home in Milan, Giuseppe Verdi, the grand old musician, is lying
jj \\ seriously ill. Private dispatches received in this city yesterday stated
jj \ that the master is suffering from a severe attack of pneumonia, and
his advanced age makes his condition alarming. Verdi is alone in his
last hours. Friends by the score come to inquire as to his condition, and all
the notables of his country, even including his King and Queen, send daily
to hear the latest bulletins from the sickroom. But there is no kin to soothe
the old man's last hours. The only one at his bedside is his friend of many
years, Boito, the famous composer.
On the 13th of October Verdi celebrated his eighty-sixth birthday, and
the anniversary was universally observed in all musical centers. Verdi is
immensely wealthy, and it is understood that at his death all his vast fortune
will go to charities. The Home for Artists established by the celebrated com
poser in Milan will of course have a large share of it.
A fraudulent receiver could, for In
stance, write "seventy" before the word
"nine" and "7" before the figure "9," and
in this way raise the check from $'J to $79,
or he could change the "nine" to "ninety"
and the $y to $90. If this were done and
the check cashed the maker, and not the
bank, would become responsible for the
loss. You cannot hold the bank respon
sible for your carelessnesss. It is wise to
draw a running line Â¦Â».-...-^^^. after the
amount in words, thus preventing any ad
ditional writing. The signature should be
in your usual style familiar to the paying
teller. See that your check has a 2-cent
revenue stamp attached. The writer of

DESK STUDIES FOR GIRLSâ MONEY AFFAIRS
Copyright, 1000, by Seymour Eaton.
V. PERSONAL ACCOUNTS AND
MONEY AFFAIRS.
(Continued.)
The Sank Account.
Girls should have a knowledge of the
routine of a bank account even though
they have not two shillings to rub to
gether. It isn't convenient to take cook
ing lessons while the family is waiting
for dinner, neither is it. wise to delay the
collection of a check while one takes a
course of study in banking. There are
certain fundamental things which girls
and boys should know, and these should
be studied without reference to their fu
ture usefulness; they are bound to be
needed some time, and usually they are
most needed when least expected.
Banks provide a place for the safe-keep
ing of money and securities, and they
make the payment of bills much more
convenient than if currency instead of
checks were the more largely used. But
the great advantage of a banking institu
tion to business men la the opportunity
it affords them of borrowing money, of
securing the cash for the carrying on of
their business, while their own capital is
locked up in merchandise or in the hands
of their debtors. Another and important
advantage is to be found in the facilities
afforded by banks for the collection of
checks, notes and drafts.
When you enter a bank to open an ac
count inquire for the cashier, and. If con
venient, take with you some one who can
introduce you and identify you as the per
son you profess to be. If you go alone
do not feel hurt if a number of questions
are asked you. While you may be per
fectly honest, a large number of people
make their living by being sharp, and be
sides, it is necessary to establish those
confidential relations which ought to exist
in all financial transactions, so that the
cashier may know something more about
you than he could ascertain by merely
looking at you and taking your name.
The cashier will have you place your sig
nature in a book or on a card. Your
name as written should be the same in
style as you Intend to place on your
checks. Your signature should be suf
ficiently characteristic to be recognised
always* as yours. If necessary the cash
ier or some officer of the bank will show
you how to make out a deposit slip. He
will give you also a small bank book, in
which you will be credited with the
amount of money which you deposit. Each
time you deposit money you will be re
quired to make out a deposit slip. The
banks furnish the printed forms free.
Under the word checks on the blank you
write the names of the banks upon which
the checks, if any, which you are de
positing are drawn. If a check is on a
distant city the name of the city should
be given. Your bank book Is in reality
only your receipt from the bank for the
money you deposit. When you deposit
money hand it to the receiving teller, and
when you wish to draw money present
your check to the paying teller. When
you wish to have your bank book bal
anced hand it to the receiving teller or to
such officer as he may designate. This is
usually done on the first of each month.
The paid or canceled checks are given
you in a day or two. when your bank book
is returned." These should all be filed in
an orderly way. They serve as vouchers
and may be useful in legal complications.
Drawing a Check.
A check is an order for money, drawn
by one who has funds in the bank, pay
able on demand. It is In reality a sight
draft on the bank. Banks provide blank
checks for their customers, and it is a
very simple matter to fill them out prop
erly. In writing in the amount begin
at the extreme left of the line. The Illus
tration given here is taken from a check
which could be easily "raised:"
Note â These studies will be continued
next week.
the check Is supposed to place the stamp
upon it and to cancel it by writing tha
date across the face. Banks sell check
books containing checks with the- Govern
ment stamps printed on the face. A
check is a draft or order on a bank and
need not necessarily be written in the pre
scribed form. Such an order written on a
sheet of note paper with a lead pencil
might be in every way a legally good,
check. Usually checks should bo
drawn "to order." The words "pay to
the order of John Brown" mean that tha
money is to be paid to John Brown or to
any person he orders it paid to. If a
check is drawn "pay to bearer" any per
son that Is the bearer can collect It. The
paying teller may ask the person cashing
the check to write his name on the back
simply to have It for reference. In writ
ing and signing checks use good black ink
and let the copy dry a little before a blot
ter is used.
You Must Be Identified.
The banks of this country make it a nilo
not to cash a check that is drawn payaWf*
to order, unless the person presenting tha
check is known at the bank or unless iio
satisfies the paying teller that he is really
the person to whom the money is to bo
paid. It must be remembered, however.that
a check drawn to order and then indor::orl
In blank by tne payee (the person to wh m
it is to be paidt is really payable to bear
er, and if the paying teller is satisfied that
the payee's signature la genuine he will
not likely hesitate to cash the check. In
England all checks apparently properly
indorsed are paid without identification.
In drawing a check in favor of a person
not likely to be well known in banking
circles write his address or his business
after his name on the face of the check.
For instance, if you would send a check t >
John Smith. Boston, it might possibly fail
Into the hands of the wrong John Smith:
but if you write the check in favor of
"John Smith. 849 Tremont Btreet. Boston."
it is more than likely that the right per
son will collect it. If you wish to get a
check cashed where you are unknown,
and it is not convenient for a friend who
has an account at the bank to go with
you for the purpose of identification, ask
him to place his signature on the back of
your check, and you will not likely hav-A
trouble in getting it cashed. By placing
his signature on the back of the check htÂ»
guarantees the bank against loss. A ban 1 ?
is responsible for the signatures of Its de
positors, but it cannot be supposed to>
know the signatures of indorsers. Th<9
reliable Identifier is in reality the persoa
who is responsible.
Indorsing Checks.
In indorsing checks note the following
points: 1. Write across the back, not
lengthwise. 2. If your indorsement 19 the
first write it an inch or two from the
ton of thtÂ» back: if it is not the first in
dorsement, write immediately under th*
last indorsement. 3. Don't Indorse wronir
end up; the top of the back ia the left end
of the face. 4. Write your name as you
are accustomed to write it, no matter how
it is written on the face. 5. If you wish
to make the check payable to some partic
ular person by indorsing 1 , write "Pay to
(name) or order," and under this write
your own name aa you are accustomed to
sign it. 6. Do not carry around indorsed
checks loosely; such checks are payable
to bearer and may be collected by any
one. 7. If you receive a check which has
been transferred to you by a blank in
dorsement, and you wish to hold It a day
or two, write over the indorsement th*
words. "Pay to the order of (yourself).'"
This is allowable legally. The check can
not then be collected until you indorse it.
8. An authorized stamped indorsement is
as good as a written one. Whether such
indorsements are accepted or not depends
upon the regulations of the clearing-hous*
in the particular city in which they are
offered for deposit. 9. If you arÂ» Indors
ing for a company or society or corpora
tion, write first the name of the company
and then your own name, followed by the
word "Treas." 10. If you have power of
attorney to indorse for some particula"
person, write his name, followed by your
own, followed by the word "Attorney" or
"Atty.," as it is usually written. 11. -write
your check payable to the order of some
person, but don't write "Pay to the. order
of Charles Brown A Co, for subscription
to Ledger for 1900." Such Information on
a paid check may serve some purpose of
yours, but it is not good business. De
scriptive and qualifying matter is quite
proper in the letter accompanying thfÂ»
check, and if the letter has been copied
it Is Just as legally valuable. 12. Do not
write any unnecessary information on the
back of your check. A story is told of a
woman who received a check from her hus
band and when cashing it wrote "your
loving wife" above her name on the back.

difficult places to avoid overdrawing is
where a line and arc meet, or two area
combine to form a curve; It Is beat to
place a dot where they appear to meet in
the pencil stage ard ink up to the dot.
Tndia ink dries nearly as fast as it is put
on. To avoid the chance of blotting,
however, it is well to ink in figures from
above downward, and from right to left.
If the pen stops marking it may often be
restarted by drawing two or three lines
on a piece of soft chamois leather; if this
falls it should be thoroughly cleaned.

MURDER NEARLY DONE
IN HIGHBINDER WAR
Trouble Among the Chinese in Marys
ville Breaks Out Afresh and
Shooting Commences.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, Jan. 9.â A dastardly at
tempt at murder, a continuation of the
highbinder war, was made in the local
Chinatown this morning. While walking
along First street Men Chin, the keeper
of a restaurant and who has always borne
a good reputation, was fired upon three
times by a strange Chinaman, who stood
on an opposite corner.
One bullet went to fragments against a
brick wall and one of the splinters cut a
hole in Men Chin's blouse near the should
er, but inflicted no injury. A stray bullet
narrowly missed the head of a- lookout
for a gambling den.
Six Chinamen are in jail on suspicion,
but there is no evidence to connect any of
them with the shooting, though six white
residents witnessed it.

KANSAS CITT, Jan. 9.â Wood E. Mitch

ture and Carpet Company, tried to fore
close a mortgage on some hogs on the
farm of C. D. French, near Grand View,
south of this city, to-day. Thomas West
lake, a hired hand, emptied the contents
of a shotgun into Mitchell's breast, killing
him instantly. Westlake had ordered
Mitchell to leave the farm, but the latter
refused, when Westlake procured a gun
and deliberately fired. Westlake surren

WASHINGTON*, Jan. 9.â The loving cup
of silver made of the melted dimes col

the majority of whom were children, was

COMPROMISE OF
SWEIGERT HEIRS
Estate to Be Divided as
Was Willed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Jan. 9.â The heirs of the late
Adam Sweigert have compromised their
differences. Miss Carrie Sweigert, who
opposed the appointment of Jonathan
Sweigert as administrator of his father's
estate, has withdrawn her objection. In
the complaint filed a few days ago she
had alleged that Jonathan Sweigert, who
acted as agent of his father, has withheld
some $28,000 collected as rents of property
and some $70,000 received from the sale of
certain Kearny-street property in San
Francisco. }
When the case was called the deposition
of Jonathan Sweigert was filed. The dis
missal of the opposition was then moved
by Judge Slack. Judge Hyland granted it
and appointed Sweigert executor of the
estate without bonds. The deposition ex
plained in detail the transactions in ques
tion relative to the property.
The agreement between the heirs is said
to be that the estate shall be divided as
the lost deeds provided and that there
shall be an equal division of the $37,500
cash in bank; also that the civil suit
brought by Mrs. Schmoll against Jona
than SweiÃert for $25,000 shall be dis
missed. Jonathan Sweigert evidently
holds the upper hand, and the opposition
hoirs were afraid that the defense fund
of $37,500 provided by the testator to pro
tect his will would stand in court. By the
terms of the will the estate is divided
equally between Jonathan Sweigert, Mrs.
Schmoll and the children of a deceased
son.

Bounty for the Manila
-Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦-Â¦

ARGUMENT BEFORE COURT
CLAIMS SPANISH FLEET WAS
SUPEBIOR.
>
If Such Is True He Will Get More
Than if the Enemy Had Been
Inferior to His Com
mand.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â The claim of
Admiral Dewey and the officers and men
of his squadron for bounty arising out of
the destruction of Montejo's fleet in Ma
nila Bay was argued, before the Court of
Claims to-day. The Question at issue was
the total amount of the bounty to be paid.
The contention of the claimants was that
the force of the enemy was superior at
Manila Bay.
Mr. King, who opened for the claimants,
first explained how the amount of the
bounty upon the e;ght destroyed vessels
was i-alculaieu 1 . Tne report of Admiral
Montt-jo snowed that wnen he went to
riubig Hay just prior to tne battle lie hau
aboard live ships 1575 men, wnose reguiar
complement was by tne oilicial recoros
i)'M. The explanation was that it wus for
the purpose ot providing prize crews tor
the American vt-y^els wuen captured. As
a result of his calculations he ngureu that
there were 1914 men aboard tne vessels
destroy eu. Uhe bounty due Admiral
lJewey and his men, therefore, would be
or Ili'l.iW. according to whether
the force of tne enemy was superior or
inferior to Dewey's. There might be a
contention in determining the strength of
the enemy that the shore batteries and
submarine mines should be excluded, but
Mr. King argued that the whole of the
enemy's strength should be considered In
determining this question. In number or
vessels alone the Spaniards were supe
rior, while experts maintained that the
guns ashore were much superior In effi
ciency to those afloat, because their plat
forms were fixed. Mr. King then quoted
Admiral Dewey's opinion that the force
of the enemy in the engagement was su
perior. There ' were four elementsâ the
torpedo-boats, the warships, the shore
batteries and the submarine mines. Each
of these elements was a menace to the
success of Dewey's licet and as such
should be counted in passing on the rights
of the claimants. In support of this con
tention he cited the fact that in the claim
of Farragut for his victory "at New Or
leans the court took into account all ele
ments, forts and obstructions, as well as
naval force captured.
Assistant Attorney General Pratt in his
argument for the Government based it
entirely on the ground that the statute
expressly stipulated "vessels" and con
tained nothing as to "land batteries" in
offering bounties to our navy for destruc
tion of the enemy in battle. He contended
for a literal construction of the statute
and advanced the suggestion that the ar
gument as to the superiority of the Span
ish forces was theoretical, and that to
judge by the results it seemed to have
been demonstrated that effective supe
riority was all on the American side. He
added:
"In making this suggestion I of course
do not in the slightest attempt to discount
the daring and gallantry of our forces.
Neither commodore, officers nor men had
any right to believe nor did any one believe
otherwise than they were taking the most
perilous chances and going into the veri
table jaws of death. And if this case is
to be decided on the question purely of
the gallantry and heroism of our forces
I concede that they are entitled to the
larger bounty claimed, but it can hardly
be said that element is the only one to be
considered."
Ex-Secretary Herbert closed the case for
the claimants. In concluding he said:
"It does not seem to be necessary to
argue this question further, but 1 can
not think that this groat tribunal, one of
the most dignitied of American courts,
will for a moment lend itself to the task
of minimizing this great American vic
tory by dividing and separating and con
sidering piecemeal the guns, and forces
which took part in that engagement."

CHICAGO, Jan. 9.â The wheat market was
oversold to-day and dull most of the time.
Liverpool was weak and In sympathy. May
wheat here opened %c under yesterday's close.
The pit was entirely on the selling side and In
the liquidation ehorts Joined. May fell off to
67?s'aC7%c. and for a time the only demand was
against puts. A rumor that a British cruiser
had fired on a Dutch ship was all that was
needed to frighten shorts. The buying thun
Inaugurated quickly developed the fact that the
market had been oversold. May ad
vanced to 67T4C, when the advance
wa< checked momentarily by the an
nouncement of the liberal Increase in the visi
ble, when a decrease had been expected. The
market only lost %c on this, then resuming Its
upward Journey, the close was strong, with
May Â«fee over yesterday.
Corn was steady, though rather quiet. The
Influence of wheat was for a time depressing,
but with the rally In that market and the ad
ditional support of a fair demand and light
Western orTerlnes-, the market advanced and
closed at the top. Wet weather also had a
steady effect. May closed %c up.
The oats market was quiet, but firm, steadied
In the face of the wheat weakness by liberal
clearances recently and a fair export demand.
Speculative business was small. May closed
%c over yesterday.
Provisions opened with a show of steadiness
In the face of liberal hog receipts, but later
succumbed to the liquidationâ much of It profit
takingâsome in sympathy with the weakness
of wheat early. The market held steady for
come time, as the demand was good and offer-
Ings were not heavy. But the receipts and the
disposition to take profits told later and the
market declined, with final figures at the bot
tom. May pork closed 15c down. May lard 10c
lower, and May ribs 7%c under.

LOCAL MARKETS.
\\ T ezi' York Stock Market
r^T-W tokk, Jan. s.â The etock market was
practically Inert durlne Hie early part Of the
fses-slon to-day, the buying demand failing to
prarcely appreciable proportions. The bear
traders watched the inviting field with longing
eyes until the attraction became too strong for
them, and they put out selling orders through
the greater part of the list. They succeeded
In effecting very marked declines and bringing
out a certain amount of offerings by uncover
lr.g Â»to;>-lortfc tirders. Hut the volume of the
selling was not important and the success of
the bears wa* due to the listless attitude of
the public toward Mocks and the listkssness
of insiders to support prices. There was no
poÂ«ltive inclder.t In the day's business ever,
for the bears to base their operations on. Their
conclusion was rather a negative one as to the
chanc*-s of any favorable change from the pres
ent depressing Influences. For the present it is
obvious that capital has no Inclination to
move Into stocks and It is noticeable that the
quiet Investment absorption, which was a fea
ture of the market during the last week In
J>eceniber and which continued into the first
*teek in January, to all intents and purposes
ocas-cd at the present level of prices. A series
of encouraging events ha.s afforded a pretty
cood test of speculative sentiment by belns
totally ignored. There have been new entries
JntÂ« the ranks cf dividend-paying stocks and
increases in the dividend rates of established
dividend payers.
The money situation haÂ» ceased to cause
suiriety owing to the return flow from domes
tic centers and the cessation of the drain on
the sub-treasury. Money markets abroad have
come through the crisis of the yearly settle
ments and are steadily working toward ease,
co that the drawing of gold from New York
1* now believed to have ceased, at leaÂ«t for
the time bring. Far- reaching accomplishments
toward harmonizing great railroad systems
tiave. been announced and disastrous trad*
wars have been pairhe<J up according to all
ej'jwaranres. The email effect produced by all
these important developments Is cited by the
bear element as indicating small hopes for
ftjiy advanrp in prlree.
There wax a ymall opening advance In stocks
In opposition to the heaviness in London and
In sympathy with strength in Huprar and Rrook
lyn Transit. The almost entire disappearance
of buylnc demand, in fpite of very little offer
ing*, then allowed prices to gradually sag un
til the a.ctl\> gelling movement of the last two
hours forved price* easily and rapidly down
vnrd.
There were a few feeble rallies, sufficient
to continue some irregularity, but the tone
In the main continued weak until the clor.e
The dividends in Louisville and Federal Steel
common, were not announced until rear the
cV.se, but the hear* counted upon their exer
cising an unfavorable effert as not bÂ»lr.z vi
to expectations. The possibility of further re
verses to Great Britain In South Africa and
rumors of foreign complications involving fur
ther embarrafsmenu for Great Britain were
tised with effect.

NEW YORK. Jan. 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were stagnant but firm to
day, awaiting news and the settlement, al
though there Is no apprehension over the lat
ter, as it is known that the weak men In
the last Fettlement have now bÂ«n strength
ened.
Berlin was Inclined to nibble at specialties
other than American shares.
Paris bought a few copper shares and Span
ish 4s.
Americans moved within the narrowest lim
its", London being: a* apathetic in regard to
them as Berlin. Union Pacilic was weak on
New York sales, which London regarded as an
Indication that there will be no dividend on
the common stock. Contangoes were 1 to 3
lower than the rate at the last settlement.
The Scotch railway carry-over on provincial
exchanges was also much easier, forecasting
low rate* to-morrow. Money was abundant at
2% per cent. The bank received Â£66,000 trold

FALSE HOLDUP REPORTS
MADE TO THE POLICE
OAKLAND, Jan. 9.â The police have
been bothered lately with reports of hold
ups which have been without foundation
and they are in a quandary to find some
method of punishing the perpetrators.
Last night some unknown Individual sent
a report to police headquarters stating
that two masked and armed highwaymen
had robbed a person named William
Mather at the corner of Thirty-fourth and
B street in East Oakland. It was assert
ed that the robbers had procured $7 in
money and a valuable gold watch.
"I made a thorough investigation,"
said Chief Hodgkina, "and learned that
there was absolutely no truth In the mat
ter. I would only like to have got hold of
the man who sent In the report. It is
getting common for lots of fellows to tell
their wives and folks that they have been
held up and robbed after they have been
spending their money In carousing and
gambling. I am getting sick of that sort
of business and am making a list of these
fakers."

Athletes to Go to Paris.
PRINCETON. N. J.. Jan. n.-Captain
Cregan announces that Â« r i picked team
from the regular track team vvi!l be taken
to Paris next summer to compete in the
Olympic games.
In ngurlng on the hour of arrival at the
*-everal ports and the hour of departure
the days are counted from noon to noon,
v'lilch will probably average. near enough
I<>r a comparison between these and other
fimllar voyages made. Upon this basis
the Brooklyn was under steam 44 days
and 17 days at anchor in five ports, mak
ing an average daily run of 263U miles,
or at a rate of nearly 11 knots an hour.
The New Orleans coaled four times, losing
3t> days in port, making ib days' steaming
lime and averaging nearly 258 knots daily,
or 10.73 knot.s per hour. The Nashville
replenished her coal supply at live sta
tions, involving a loss of 24 days, giving
f3 days at sea and an average daily run
of VZI miles, or at the rate of 9.25 knots an
hour.. The little Marietta stopped at six
Â«.-nlinp stations, with 24 days' loss of
Time, her steaming days thereby reduced
to 54 and showing an average daily run of
I. early 217 miles, or exactly S knots, which
v;'- very fair for the San Francisco built
punboat.
The distances between the several port*?
where stoppages were made have been
taken by the most direct and stralghtest
Ftec-red course, and these distances are
piven as follows;
*Â¦'â¢Â«- Tcrk to Gibraltar J 200

lvn .Sai<3 to Aden 1,392
A<ien to Colombo 2,130
tVilombo to Singapore 1.f.50
Â£ingapore to Masile. 1,866
Total. New fork to Manila 11.533
It was expected that, barring the re-
Ftrictions imposed by steaming at the
mopt ?â¢eonomical speed, which ranges from
eleven to eight knots in the ships repre
sented, there would be no unnecessary de
lay at the coaling stations. Coaling
should only have required about ten days,
and the excess Is probably caused by
overhauling of machinery and boilers.
The highest average speed reached be
tween intermediate ports was 13.70 knots
for the Brooklyn between Colombo and
Singapore, and her lowest average run
w;ts 8.86 knots between Aden and Co
.'omlwi. The New Orleans ran off an aver
age of 12.90 knots between Aden and Co
lombo, and fell as low as 9.70 for the run
between Port Said and Aden, due prob
ftbly (o delay in the Suez canal. The
Nas-hville and Marietta reeled off an aver
age of 11.1 and 11 knots respectively on
the run from Aden to Colombo.
The records of transports and other
Government vessels not of the navy make
0 better showlner. the best time having
l>ecn made by the hospital ship Relief,
v.-hich accomplished the voyage from New
York to Manila in 40 days. The Sherman
made the trip in 42 days, the Sheridryi In
M days and the Hooker in 57 days. While
Â¦t'lese vessels, barring the Relief, may not
have avt-raK*>d greater speed, they prob
ably shortened the voyage very mate
rially by r.ot tarrying too long- at the coal
ing stations, and the Brooklyn, of all ves
sels, should certainly have made a better
record.

URGE THAT DRYDOCKS
BE MADE OF STONE
Naval Experts Point Out That
Wooden Structures Have Been ~
Proved Unreliable.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 9.â Secretary Long
has written to Senator Hale, chairman
of the Senate Committee on Naval Af
fairs, and Acting Chairman Foss of the
House Naval Committee, strongly em
phasizing the advantage of stone over
timber drydocks and urging that the ma
terial for new docks at League Island,
Pennsylvania, and Mare Island, Califor
nia, be changed from timber to stone. He
cays Admiral K-ndicott, chief of tho Bu
reau of Yards and Docks, reports that the
change can be made without modifying
the work already done or without Increase
of cost due to the abandonment of work
already done.
Admiral Kndlcott also reports at length,
Jtatfng that "timber drydocks are found
by the Government's experience to be
structures of a temporary character, re
quiring very extensive repairs after the
lapse of a few years, and frequently these
repairs amount to a reconstruction of the
work, while drydocks of concrete and
stone are permanent structures, requiring
very slight repairs."
Ho adds that In case of urgency, as In
time of war, such unreliable drydocks aro
of intolerable disadvantage to the naval
service. The navy has spent in the last
ten years, he says, eight times as much
upon Its four timber docks as upon it
four masonry drydocks. Secretary Long
writes that he fully concurs in the views
expressed.

GENERAL BUTLER'S
ADVICE NOW NEEDED
LONDON, Jan. 10, 4:30 a. m.â The War
Office has not contributed the least par
ticular as to what Is taking place In Na
tal since Sunday. Neither has It allowed
the dispatches of correspondents to get
through. Consequently the facts of the
situation are replaced by conjectures and
the Impatience of the public pours Itself
Into a discussion of the conduct of the
war and of what might have been done
or ought to be done.
The Morning **ost demands that the.
forces affected, afloat and In preparation,
sJiould be Increased by 65,000 men. To this
end It urges tnat all the trained men the
country possesses, militia and volunteers,
shai< be called out, asserting Incidentally
that although the attitude of thÂ« other
powers Is correct In the diplomatic sense
of the word, an Invasion, if attempted,
wouid be sudden, and that now Is the
time to apprehend contingencies.
The Dally News editorially defines the
public opinion of the Continent as "In a
state which should not be Ignored."
It calls for "greater vigilance than ever
o/i the part of those responsible for the
efficiency of the state," and advises cau
tion and business-like diplomacy.
The Dally Mall says It understands that
the supercession of another general com
manding In South Africa will shortly be
announced. This may have relation to
General Butler's hasty summons from
Davenport. It Is reported that he came by
special train to London yesterday and
h*!d a long consultation with the head
quarters staff. This seems to Indicate
that his advice, which only recently was
in extreme disfavor. Is about to be util
ized.

CAPITALIST NICHOLL
SEEKS A NEW TRIAL
OAKLAND, Jan. 9.â The motion for a
new trial in the Hodge-Nicholl breach of
promise suit will come on for hearing be
for Judge Ogden on January 22. The state
ment on the motion was filed to-day by
the attorneys for John Nicholl, the aged
and wealthy defendant. The document
consists of 230 type-written pages, which
the attorneys for Miss Jane Hodge will
have to wade through. The grounds on
which the motion for a new trial is
based are briefly as follows: Irregularity
in the proceedings of the court, jury and
counsel, preventing defendant having a
fair trial; $25,000 being excessive damages;
Insufficiency of evidence to Justify the
verdict; verdict against law, and errors
of law accruing at the trial and excepted
to by defendant.
Dr. Sander Fined Again.
OAKLAND. Jan. 9.â Dr. J. Ambrose
Sander has been denied a new trial by
Judge Smith and been ordered to pay a
fine of $250 for violating the fire limits
ordinance. The defendant refused to pay
the judicial assessment and took an ap
peal to the Superior Court. Sander has
been convicted before for the same of
fense, but that did not deter him, and
he has persisted in Ignoring the law. On
a previous occasion the Superior Court
dismissed his appeal and sustained the de
cision which found him guilty.
Women of Oakland Take Steps for the Com
fort of Female Employes.
THE women of Oakland have gone even beyond the Mothers'
Union of Golden Gate, and they demand not only seats for fe
male clerks in stores, but a place where female employes con go at
noontime and lunch and rest quietly. Action to this end was taken
by the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Oakland and is
officially announced by their press agent. "
The W. C. T. U., through their press agent, Mrs. Margaret B.
Pelton, has issued a statement which tells their experience with the
question of seats in stores.
Mrs. Alice Bunnell of the Oakland Club declares herself ear
nestly in favor of the proposed reform.
THE SEAT
LAW IS A
DEAD LETTER
W. C. T. U. Women Issue a
Statement About Female
Clerks.
OAKLAND. Jan. o.â The Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union of Oakland has Is
sued an oilicial statement through its
press agent, Mrs. Margnrct B. Pelton, in
which it says that the law requiring seata
In stores has been allowed to become a
dead letter. The members ask that some
plan be adopted whereby a "noon rest"
can be maintained, where clerks can aecure !
rest and cheap refreshments.
But the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union goes beyond this, and Bays that the
female clerks are not allowed to use the
seata that the law requires to be placed
in the stores.
This is the official statement issued by
the Woman's Christian Temperance Un
ion upon this question:
Many months aso when the Noon Kest, with
lunch and reading rooms, was oiiened in tho
I'layter block by Oakland Union. \V. C. T. U.,
and the tired cirls and weary women crowded
In from store and offlce to enjoy a cup of hot
tea or chocolate and a rest in easy chairs or a
couch, with the latest papers and magazines
Just within reach, it was an open secret that
the next, move for the comfort of the girls "
was to be an effort on the i>art of the ladies
to have sections 5, 6 and 17 enforced.
This law enacted in ISS9 throuKh the efforts
of the women who had succeeded in arousing
the interest of the lawbreakers, was like bo
many other good laws allowed to become a
dead letter after the tlrst few yearsâ not more
through the neglect of the Commissioner than
the indifference of those who had striven bo
earnestly to have it passed.
Having gained their point and rejoiced over
their victory, they turned to fresh fields and
pastures new, never doubting that the "good
Commissioner" would take care of the good
laws, and that between them both the work-
Ing girl and the clerk and the saleslady would
be provided with seats and allowed to occupy
those seats without incurring the displeasure
of the lloorwalker or the proprietor.
After investigating the stores and finding
that some ot them were provided with seats,
the natural inquiry arose, "Why are not these
seats occupied when your work is done?" This
whs not answered in a straightforward man
ner, but sometimes playfully and sometimes
sarcastically the changes would be rung on the
old adage, "Woman's work is never done."
After a while it dawned upon us that for some
good reason the girls did not care to answer.
Then we went to a floorwalker In one of our
largest stores and boldly facing the lion de
manded to know why the girls didn't use the
Mats provided. The answer was, "Perhaps
they found that while seats may tend to length
en the life of the average woman, they
do not lengthen her term of employment In
any business house."
3d that was the secretâ the solution of the
mystery as to why the girls did not wish us to
urge this much r.oeded reform. >
We asked a bright girl clerk why she did not
avail herself of the privilege of rest between
customers. "When your goods are all replaced
tru your counter clear, what harm would come
to any onÂ« by your sitting down?" "Dear ma
dam," was the reply, "if you were a clerk and
tried It. and the floorwalker came and looked at
you. Just once, you would know the reason bet
ter than I could possibly tell you."
After this revelation of the "Lady and the
Lion" we allowed the matter to drop for fear
of injuring Instead of helping the grtrls we
had tried to defend. All this came out
anew at the meeting of the union on Monday
afternoon when they were asked to Indorse
the resolution passed by the Golden Gate
Mothers' Club, which they did most heartily,
hoping that some bright mind would develop
a way out of the difficulty through which our
girls would reap the benefit and the merchants
find that Instead of injuring their business by
providing for the health and comfort of their
help they had gained financially and morally.

INSANE DOCTOR PUTS
A BABE TO DEATH
Called Upon to Treat the Little One,
He Crushes Its Head With
His Hands.
HAMPTON', lowa, Jan. 9.â Dr. G. W.
Appleby, for several years tho leading
physician at Brlstow. Butler County, last
evening. In a fit of Insanity, killed a ten
months' old child of Henry Wearly of this
place, while making an examination of It
In Dr. Hobson;s office In this city. The
parents had brought the child to Dr. Hob
son's office to be treated for some trifling
ailment, and before he had time to attend
to it he was called out. Dr. Appleby, who
was visiting Dr. Hobson, was In the office,
and Hobson suggested that Dr. Appleby
make the necessary examination, which,
as soon as Dr. Hobson left the office, he
proceeded to do.
He took the child In his arms and han
dled It so roughly that the parents pro
tested, but to no avail. He suddenly put
his thumbs under its chin and with his
fingers on top of Its head crushed its face
In so that the blood gushed out of Its
nose and mouth. Then ne seized the child
by one foot and began swinging It around
his head, resisting all efforts of the terror
stricken parents to stop him. and It was
not until help arrived that the child was
taken from him. It was quite dead.
The Insane Commission was convened
and at midnight Dr. Appleby was on his
way to the Hospital for the Insane at In
dependence. TSiree or four hours after the
occurrence he seemed comparatively ra
tional, and said he knew what he was
doing when he killed the child, but could
not help It. The cause of his Insanity Is
supposed to be religious excitement.

"STAND BY"
THE WOMEN
Mrs. Bunnell Thinks That
the S and Taken Is
Right.
OAKLAND, Jan. 9.â The Oakland Club,
of which Mrs. G. W. Bunnell is the presi
dent, will meet to-morrow, and the reso
lutions of the Golden Gate Mothers' Union
with regard to providing seats for clerks
In stores will then be considered. It Is Im
possible to fay what action will be. taken,
but Mrs. Bunnell is in earnest accord with
the movement. Speaking of the matter,
Mrs. Bunnell said this afternoon:
"There is no reason why a girl employrd
In a store should not sit down when not
engaged In her work, and the idea among
merchants that it conveys an idea of dull
ness Is a fallacy. We women know when
an establishment Is doing a good or a bad
business, and we also know where we
want to deal before we go out to buy any
thing. The working women should be
treated humanely, and 1 think that in
those cases where they are not the mat
ter will be remedied. I have not discussed
the matter very extensively, but all tho*e
whom I have seen are apparently a unit
on the Idea that merchants should pro
vide seats for their employes, to be used
while they are not engaged."
The matter In question could hardly
come directly before the Ebell Society, be
cause of the difference in the line of work
of that organization, but the ladies are
in sympathetic accord with the movement
that began In Golden Gate.
"The Ebell Society has taken no formal
consideration of the matter," said Mrs. ft.
P. Gleason, the president, "but every
member Is heartily In accord with the
proposition to furnish seats for the young
ladles employed in the various downtown
stores. As I understand it, most of the
female employes are thus provided for,
but there is not always the opportunity
to use them. No matter how wealthy a
Â¦woman is. she always has a sisterly feel
ing for the less fortunate female, and does
not want to see her abused. The members
of the Ebell Society will take no concerted
action In the matter, but I am sure that
they will all act individually."
JUDGE SMITH
DISMISSED THE
REGULAR JURY
Held There Was Bias
in Its Selection.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 9.
Police Judge Smith to-day dismissed the
regular Police Court jury panel that had
been summoned to try the case of Joe
Rosenberg, charged with maintaining a
place where the now famous crap game
was run. The dismissal was made upon
the claim by the defense that the jury
was selected by a member of the police
force who was prejudiced against the crap
players.
The jury was selected by W. A. Moore,
the regular jury otticer, and waa in at
tendance to try the ca.se of Joe Rosenberg,
the owner of the place. The defense at
tacked Moore ami charged that he be
lieved that the defendant was guilty and
that ho had selected jurors In accordance
with his own view of the case.
Moore was called to the stand and ad
mitted that he believed Rosenberg was
guilty, but den'ert that this affected his
selection of a jury.
A motion was then made by the attor
neys for Rosenberg that the entire regular
jury panel be dismissed by the Police
Judge upon the grounds of bias on the
part of the officer who selected them.
Judge Smith allowed the motion and
ordered that a new panel be summoned
by the Sheriff, the police being held to be
too much interested in the prosecution to
be able to select an impartt.il jury. This
panel was not brought into court until
late in the afternoon, and the selection of
a jury was gone through with before the
court finally adjourned. The panel was
exhausted when nine jurors had been
selected, and the case will be tried to
morrow by the following men: M. J. Hal
llhan. Fred Murdock. W. A. Young. M.
Ricker, James King. George Duddy, Wil
liam Irish, W. Moore and Thomas
Wyckoff.
There was a big crowd in the court
room, drawn there because this was the
trial of Rosenberg, the man with whom
Police Judge Smith took his midnight
supper, and because this was one of the
cases where the Police Department was
making Its most determined contest.

These little "jolly ups" were kept up

During the daytime the chief amuse

to locate birds willing to be slaughtered.
The pirates found, though, that Marln
birds are "wise." They kept out of range

After cruising around four or five days

HE WILL MARRY
THE SWEETHEART
OF HIS BOYHOOD
Fresno Recorder's Ro
mance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 9.
James McCune Kerr, Recorder of
Fresno County, and Miss Emma Varlna
McPherson. daughter of Daniel McPher
son, a well-to-do Contra Costa County
rancher, are the principals In a little ro
mance, the secret of which has just be
come known.
More than fifteen years ago, after Mr.
Kerr and Miss McPherson had been
sweethearts and schoolmates at Danville
for several years, the removal of the
Kerrs to Fresno County broke up the love
affair. Each has longed to see the other
again, but circumstances or opportunities
were such that the lovers have never met
until recently.
Several months ago, during the oil boom,
Mr. Kerr had occasion to visit San Fran
cisco on business connected with some oil
mining company. In the metropolis he
met by mere chance William Lee Mcrher
son, a brother of the sweetheart of his
boyhood days. Inquiry revealed the fact
that Miss McPherson was still in the land
of the living. On the evening of the same
day Mr. Kerr called at the MoPherson
residence In this city. The separation
during the past fifteen years had in no
wise cooled the ardor and attachment of
the couple and the agreeable climax of
that visit was the announcement to the
parents of the engagement, although the
matter was studiously kept from the ears
of gossips.
To-day Mr. Kerr paid a friendly visit
to Alameda County, Clerk Jordan and
"Just incidentally," as he expressed it. se
cured a marriage license to make Miss
Emma V. McPherson his bride. The ages
of the parties were given as 39 and 2C
years, respectively.
The marriage ceremony to-morrow
afternoon will be performed by Rev. R. S.
Thirmington. pastor of the Presbyterian
Church at Danville, where the bride and
groom-to-be attended Sabbath-school in
their childhood days. The affair will be
unostentatious and the conventional
bridesmaid and best man will not be In at
tendance. On the return from their
honeymoon the couple will make their
home at Fresno.
DECLARED GOD
ALONE SHOULD
SIT AS JUDGE
Albright Refused to
Act as Juror.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
DOS Broadway, Jan. 9.
If B. F. Albrights interpretation of the
Holy Writ was California law Gcd alone
would sit in judgment on lawbreakers
and no human agtncy would ever deal out
justice this side of the pearly gates.
Mr. Albright has conducted a barber
shop in Alameda for many years. His dis
tinction on the pedestal of notoriety has
never reached beyond his good reputation
as a law-abiding citizen, a good husband
and an expert manipulator of the hair
clipper and razor. To-day, however. Mr.
Albright created the sensation of his life
time in Judge Ojden's court.
The Alameda barber had been sum
moned as a Juror in the trial of John
Serverra, indicted by the Grand Jury for
perjury. Albright, am>;ng others, asked
to be excused from serving on the panel
of trial jurors for the ensuing term.
When asked for his reasons he arose
calmly In the Jury box and announced
that he did not feel competent to serve
as a Juror on account of nis religious be
liefs.
"My spiritual growth," he continued,
"has been such that I cannot sit in judg
ment on a fellow-man. I cannot agree to
find a verdict of guilty If called on a jury
when the effect would be the Imprison
ment of the individual on trial. Any man
who has transgressed the law I would
leave him with God alone.
"My spiritual growth has been such
that I do not feel that man should be
punished by human hands. I would leave
that with God to do, and I could not bring
in a verdict of guilty. 1 feel that way be
cause I am guided by Holy Writ ar.d
my conclusions are drawn from a very
close study of the Bible. I could not find
a man guilty, no matter what he has
done. I would, therefore, ask to be ex
cused."
The courtroom at the time was crowded
with attorneys and spectators, who lis
tened with bated breath. The silence that
followed the Juror's exclamations was
broken only by Judge Ogden. who. ap
parently with wonderment, replied:
"Mr. Albright, you are not passing
judgment on a man when you sit as a
juror. It remains for the court to pass
judgment. You are simply the judge of
the facts. Your belief in the Bible makes
you the kind of a juror that is most de
sirable, but you misinterpret the grÂ«nt
book. While we all take the holy script
as our guide, yet your idea and interpre
tation would make right subordinate to
might, and anarchy would prevail over
the land. There is nothing in the Blhlo
to substantiate your views, for the Scrip
tures uphold law. order and society. Tho
execution of your ideas would mean law
lessness, disorder and confusion: crime
and individual strife would run rampant,
and society and government would be
torn asunder.
'â¢While I consider your excuse not a
valid one, I feel constrained, under thÂ©
circumstances, to grant your request. You
may be excused."
And as the tonsorial interpreter or
Holy Writ passed out into the corridor
there was not a spectator whose eyes
were not fastened upon the man who
feared to judge his fellow-man ami who
believed that all wrongdoers should bÂ«
tried by the Lord.
A Jury was secured finally and the trial
of Serverra cojnmenced.

STEWARDS OF
TANFORAN WINK
AT RUFFIANISM
They Evade Giving an
Apology.
CORRIGAN INSULT ADMITTED
I2TEXFLICABLE MANEUVERS OP
THE BOARD.
When Edward Corrigan gave a public
exhibition of his blackguardism at Tan
foran last Saturday he probably did not
think that his vicious attack upon R. B.
Mllroy would provoke a turf war on this
coast. He knows now, however, that ha
thrust his offensive self too far Into the
affairs of reputable horsemen, and the
California Jockey Club and the Western
Turf Association have locked horns over
the matter.
The stewards of the Western Turf As
sociation met last night to discuss the let
ter of apology demanded by the Califor
nia Jockey Club an 4 to investigate the
outrage which Corrigan publicly inflicted
upon Mllroy.
The meeting was significant in two as
pects. The stewards postponed a decision
until to-morrow and, in doing so, showed
that rowdyism and ruffianism at Tanfo
ran have their indorsement when the
offenses are committed by the man who
controls the actions of the stewards. In
declining to take action the stewards de
liberately widened the breach between
the California Jockey Club and the West
ern Turf Association, the connection be
tween which has been none too friendly.
The officers of the California Jockey
Club are determined that an apology shall
be made for the insult offered to it
through its secretary. If it Is not forth
coming the war will begin and will be
maintained. The situation is one which
has created a great deal of comment in
turfdom. When the stewards met last
night Milroy and several witnesses of the
outrageous assault of Saturday were pres
ent by invitation.
Milroy related the facts of the assault
as they have already been published. He
offered William Muray, Dan Hanlon and
Clarence Waterhouse as witnesses, but the
stewards declared through Messrs. Fair
and Kirkpatrick that no additional testi
jnony was necessary. Mr. Milroy 1 a verac-

PROFESSIONAL DEBUT
OF MISS MARY SCOTT
THERE were two events of Impor
tance at the California Theat* last
night. One was the production of
Plnero's play, "The Princesa and the
Butterfly." and the other the debut of
Miss Mary Scott. I am moved to com
ment firstly on the latter and lesser event
because It was that that drew the crowd
and takes first place in point of interest
If not in point of Importance.
And now I must make a digression.
Once upon a time there was an army
officer. At a certain battle in the late
rebellion he was killed. It is told that
he died in the arms of a certain scldier

Btern duty it is to judge impartially and
without sentimental conscfousnesi the
merits of stage folk. So be It.
Miss Scott in assuming the role of Fay
Zulianl undertook a task that might wefl
try the ability of an experienced actress.
To say that she was overweighted would
be but the truth: to say that she failed
would be doing her an injustice. A good
amateur is rarely a good professional at
the moment of transition from one state
to the other, but if the fledgling show
promise he or she should be encouraged
that artistic good may accrue. The hope
less amateur, however, should be ruth
lessly crushed out of existence as a men
ace to the stage, which can ill afford the
further lncuraloh of mediocrity. I am
happy to say that Miss Scott is not of
these, for, although her shortcomings are
evident In the trying role of Fay Zuliani,
she Is possessed of talent that might be
considerable in another part. Her ability
lies, I think, in comedy, of which she had
little opportunity to give token. She does
not get over the difficulties of the foreign
accent In which her lines are cast, but
this is but one of the tests with which she
had to contend, and through which" she
carried herself commendably. She has
personal beauty and charm, and Beemed
keenly appreciative of the welcome ac
corded her. It is always a pleasure to
take part in such a reception, and the
friendly applause and procession of flow
ers with which she was greeted should
have and probably did make her very
happy. I hope bo.

George Lamorant was suggestive of the
villainous roles in which we are used to
seeing him, but acted with Understanding
and address. In the fourth act. in which
he has a scene with Fay. there was a
flash of freedom from his customary af
fectation that was welcome. He does net
set forth the subtleties of Pinero with the
convincing touch, yet he succeeded In
making a good deal of a fine part. MIB3

OUTCASTS SOUTH OF MARKET
DEMOdLAZTIC STATESIOTN' MUST
lOOK FOB NEW PTEU>S.
The portion of the city of San Francisco
rltuate south of Market street has given
to the public service many able Democrat
ic leaders and eeveral statesmen of re
nown. The people "south of the slot"
have always been proud of their poli
ticians, but they must realize now the
truth of the proverb that "pride
gx>eth before a fall." They must see that
they, no longer dwell in the lone of po
litical favor.
The w-lse men "south of the slot" will
not lose their heads by threatening to call
mass meetings of indignation, but they
will turn their attention to the production
Of greatness in some other field of human
activity. Philosophers should be gradu
ated. The modern school of philosophy
Â»outh of the slot ehould teach that the
"Mayor loveth whom he chasteneth."
Then the lesson could be Illustrated by
showing that the "overlook" which the
Mayor gave to his loyal and earnest con
stituents was a proof of his love and care.
Again, philosophy might teach that the
Mayor In his wisdom does not lay uncom
mon stress on one's dwelling place. The
mere fact of a man dwelling In one dis
trict Khould not. according to the Mayor's
rule, circumscribe his activities In another
tjuarter of the city.
Reference to the habitat of the newly
appointed Commissioners clearly Ehows
that the territory comprising: the Forty-
Cm Assembly Districtâ the banner Re
publican district of San Franciscoâ ls the
Major's favored zone. From that district
he selected nine Commissioners. The For
tieth District, also Republican, comes next
In favor. Seven Commissioners were taken
therefrom. The Thirty-fourth, Thlrty
eJg-hth and Thirty-ninth each received
three appointments. The Thirty-seventh
exd Forty-third each secured two. The
Thirtieth, Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth
each secured one.

Knowledge that great masses of Demo

would not disturb the mental balance of a

modern, good-natured philosophy In one
of the many Democratic strongholds south
of the slot. There Is no use kicking and
bucking on the part of the good people
In the non-offlce-holdlng region. Politi
cians and philosophers alike know that
the existing offices are given out, and new
places cannot be created until the new
charter is amended. There Is a little grain
of consolation for the masses In the

Democratic leaders, tho have been In
Mayor Phelan's ca.ru' aod know by per
sonal experience the value of a Phelan j
pledge, make pointed allusion to the exist- I
lngr controversy. A sarcastic apostle of
the unterrined, who was familiar with
the ins and outs of the Democratic State
Convention at Sacramento In 1898, ex
pressed yesterday hla opinions with char
acteristic freedom.
"I have no sympathy," he remarked,
"with the Fire Department managers
who made the Maxwell compaot with
Phelan. They knew that the Mayor
could not be trusted to keep a promise.
They knew that he violated solemn
pledges made to Judge Hughes' friends in
the State convention at Sacramento.
Phelan there pledged his word of honor
to the San Diego delegation to give his
support to the cause of nominating Judge
Hughes for Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court. The pledge was accepted in
I good faith by the friends of Judge Hughes,
but Phelan cast aside the promise and
voted for Judge Coffey. I wouldn't trust
a promise made by Phelan unless it was
given in the form of a promissory note, so
Judgment of the court could be invoked to
compel its fulfillment. Again I say that
I have no sympathy for these men who
entered into a compact with Phelan. A
line of broken promises and violated
pledges marks every step of his political
career. He will enter into solemn agree
ment with his fellow men in convention
and then throw the agreement to the
winds without a word of explanation or
Justification.
"I know something of convention his
tory in this State, and I will leave it to
the Judgment of the delegates from San
Diego County to the Democratic conven
tion at Sacramento in IS9S if Phelan did
not utter a solemn promise to cast the
entire vote of the San Francisco delega
tion for Judge Hugrhes in return for the
vote of the San Diego delegation to ex
clude the Harneyites. I will leave it to
delegates representing San Diego County
If Phelan did not deliberately turn about !
in violation of the pledge and give the
support to Judge Coffey which was prom
ised to Judge Hughes.
"I am not surprised that the Mayor
promised his influence to both Maxwell
and Gorman. What does astonish me is
tne fact that Maxwell's supporters place
confidence in the Mayor's word."

Hop Sings First
Refused to Lay
Down Arms.
Officers Discover
High Explosives
in Den of a Tong
FOR a time at least the Hop Stngr
Tong and the Suey Sing Tong
have dropped their hatchets in
San Francisco. Yesterday aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock a compact
was signed at the headquarters of the
See Yup Society by which the presi
dents of the warring factions agree to
discontinue hostilities and lay down
their arms until the matters which pre
cipitated the disagreement can be sub
mitted to arbitration. The suspension
of hostilities is due to the
action of the four Chinese
companies of See Yups, the Six Com
panies, the Chinese Merchants' Asso
ciation and the Chinese Consul Gen
eral, all of whom foresaw the disas
trous condition of affairs which, would
follow the blow which the Hop Sing 1
Tong was preparing to deliver its
rival. The nineteen hired assassins
who have participated in the recent
murders left the city yesterday morn
ing. Acting Chief of Police Biggy
found a quantity of giant powder and a
complete arsenal in one of the head
quarters of the Hop Sings last night.
For the past Beveral days an effort
has been made to quell the disturbance
between the tongs. The Six Chinese
Companies, the Chinese Consul and or
ganizations of respectable merchants
issued proclamations of peace, but the
trouble brewing only assumed more
ominous proportions. The Hop Singa,
who on account of their weakened
ranks were being worsted, had called
upon their members out of town to re
port here for duty, that they might
avenge the deaths of their fellow
members. On Monday many of them
arrived, and the determination of the
Hop Sing Tong never relaxed.
Yesterday morning the merchants, in
The president of the Hop Sing Ton*
was not present, he having deserted
the city after an attempt to take his
life was made on the opening day of
the hostilities, but his representative
spoke for him. He stated that the
Hop Sing Tong would under no con
sideration drop the matter, and a
number of threats had to be used be
fore he would even consent to a sus
pension of hostilities The agreement
which was finally effected will not
prevent shooting in the interior coun
ties, and as the Hop Sings are more
numerous out of the city It Is ex
pected that the war will be carried
back to Marseille and fought to a
finish, even before the truce In San
Francisco expires.
The statement made that the Hop
Sings would sue for peace or that its
members were instrumental In bring
about the truce which was declared
yesterday is pronounced by prominent
Chinese and officers to be nonsensi
cal and absurd. The Declaration of
Truce is as follows:
This notice is served by the See Tup So
ciety that the Suey Sing and the Hop Sing,
two tongs, have agreed to stop trouble and
terms will have to be made to make
them forget and forgive.
The Introduction of twenty extra
policemen into Chinatown yesterday
drove nineteen of the dangerous high
binders to other climes. Under the di
rection of Acting Chief of Police Biggy^
Captain Wittman and Sergeant Duke^
with ten officers, searched fifteen high
binder Joints. The officers were armerf
with search warrants and discovered
weapons in nearly every place. The
most startling discovery, however, was
made last night J,n the headquarters of
the Hop Sings, -where high explosives
were found, in addition to many weap
ons and implements for the manufac
ture of bullets and powder. -At 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon the fifteen
places were blockaded simultaneously
by the police and the Chinese were
surprised. Acting Chief Blggy says
that he will not withdraw the ad
ditional officers from Chinatown for
several days yet, until he is assured
that the contracting parties will keep
their faith. He stated that he will
exert every effort to prevent murder,
and his work yesterday has had Its ef
fect already. Â¦: #
particular, viewed the situation with
much apprehension and concluded
that some settlement must be made.
The Chinese festivals were approach-
Ing and business was stunted. Even
the theaters and gambling-housea
were deserted, as Chinese feared to
walk on the Btreets after sundown.
Accordingly yesterday morning the
leaders of the tongs were called to the
headquarters of the See Yup Society,
on the corner of Clay street and
Waverly place, and after four hours
of discussion were forced to sign an
agreement declaring for peace until a
board of arbitration can convene.
let peace reign. The disturbance arose from
quarreling on the part of Ignorant people.
Now outside parties have effected this set
tlement and If any further trouble occurs
we will assist in punishing those who dis
obey.

There is much speculation as to
â¢whether the difficulties will bÂ«
straightened out before the truce ex
pires. Some of the Chinamen are of
the opinion that It will, but the warlike
attitude of the Hop Sings, who have
had four men wounded or killed, seems
to Indicate that some very encouraging
