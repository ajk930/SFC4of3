the "representatives of Mrs. Craven were
engaged in an effort to locate the respon

description. Last. Wednesday evening a
statement was given newspaper men a.t

that in a garret he had unearthed a.
musty register of the El Monte Hotel for
the year 1892. and that in ; this register.
under' date of July 23. was the entry
"James G. Fair and wife." It was the
common opinion of plaintiffs counsel that
this purported discovery . was a trap laid
for them, the idea being to get Mrs. Cra

passed 'the night at the hotel with Senator
Fair and then to prove that no such reÂ«

SIMPTON WAS TO TELL A
PERJURED TALE IN COURT
Another Chapter of Sensations Is Added to the Notorious Litigation
in Which Many Reputations Have Been Lost
in Pursuit of Rich Game.
r Â§ expected has happened. Another sensation has been sprung in the celebrated litigation over
J[ the will and estate of James G. Fair, and several more reputations are dangling in the midair of
accusation and suspicion. A /"etc days ago Mrs. Xcttie R. Craven, zi'ho has been striving to vein
a zvidovj's rights and privileges and a share of the estate, startled the opposition forces to her by pro
ducing another apparently important witness, a George W. Simpton, ex-Justice of the Peace of Sausa
lito. He was thrust fonuard with the astounding announcement that he had married Mrs. Craven and
James G. Fair in ISO 2. The sponsor of Simpton ii f as A. Sylva, xvho as Trustee of Sausalito has had
a career more or less pleasant to himself.
Simpton swore, in an affidavit that he married Mrs. Craven and the late Senator James G. Fair.
Mrs. Craven has sworn upon the witness-stand that she was married by Simpton, and now he swears in
an affidavit taken before Judge Hunt that the.ivhole incident is a fabrication and a conspiracy of lies
and perjury in which he zvas to receive $10,000 for his false testimony. He sa\s that he entered the
scheme simply for the glorious purpose of trapping Mrs. Craven and contributing to the splendid cam
paign which is to make justice triumphant and right prevail. His latest contribution to the sparkling
literature of the famous case is contained in his affidavit, herewith published.
LONDON, Feb. 10.â The following is Lord Roberts' message to
the War Office: JACOBSDAL, Feb. 16, 2a. m.â French with artillery,

ominous tones at the possibility
of .the introduction into the
struggle of the horrors of sav
age warfare. The Ministers
stated that it had been decided
that if the native territory; of
Cape Colony should be invaded
the natives would be encouraged
and assisted in every way to de
fend themselves.
In all the clubs last night there
was an unusual number of visit
ors talking over the war news. It
cannot be. said that the members
.were elated, but there was a senti
ment of suppressed satisfaction,
which has been a stranger in the
clubs for many a week. Some
seemed to think that more news
would be forthcoming soon, but
that was not the view of the mili
tary members, who gave it as
their opinion that nothing more
would be heard for another twen
ty-four hours, owing to the se
verity of the marches already
made.
On the Stock Exchange mat
ters were not taken quietly.
There was both excitement and
activity, especially in the Kaffir
market, where a small boom set
in, causing the Rand mines to
rise over a point.
Lord Rosebery in the House
of Lords last night made a sec
ond attack upon Lord Salis
bury with vigor .-and often vehe
mence of language. He made
a strong indictment against the
Government. There was 'no
mincing of words and no pre
tense at- reserve in the picture
which Rosebery drew of the per
ils of the hour.
"This is a great emergency,"
said he. "The Government has
fifty thousand more troops to
send to South Africa. If these
are not sufficient, what then?
What then?" he repeated in ac
cents that visibly thrilled the
house. "Thisjs for us a matter
of life' an/d deith" * Nothing, can
hide the fact that behind Rob
erts' force, with the exception of
the Eighth division, we have no
more trained soldiers. If you
lose South Africa you lose the
principal column of your empire.
You will be shut up in these isl
ands, one of which does not love
you."
Rosebery's speech made a
great sensation at the clubs and
in political circles. Advocates
of a reorganization of the Minis
try, with Rosebery and a few
other imperialistic Liberals in it,
are increasing in numbers every
day.
LYTTELTON SUCCEEDS
TO CLERY'S COMMAND
LONDON. Feb. 12.â A special dispatch
to the Times t from Chleveley. Natal,
dated Tuesday. February 13, says:
"General Lyttelton has succeeded to
tho commam! of the second division ' dur
ing the illness of General Clery, who is
suffering from blood-poisoning. Colonel
pursue them. It does not appear that the friendship of
France would bear any great strain, and as to Russia
events have been recently -witnessed In Persia of -which Eng
land would have had something to say, but which she now
passes unnoticed. -
"It becomes the Government to take a large grasp of tho
situation and to make adequate proposals.' If Great Britain
were to lose South Africa she would lose the most impor
tant base outside of the United Kingdom, and she would
lose that colonial support which has been given because
the colonies have believed , that they were associating;
themselves with a powerful empire, and thus the emplro
would break away from us. If this be not a life and death
crisis I don't know what is."
The Earl of Kimberley, the Liberal leader, said he felt
the danger of the situation equally with Lord Rosebery.
Although he would not ascribe a direct hostile intention to
Russia at the present moment, he said, he could not over
look the fact that there was a movement of troops in prog
nss, which, if not menacing, showed that popslbilities of
the future were not absent from the Russian mind.'
â¢ The Marquis of Salisbury, the Premier, in the course of
his reply for the Government said:
"I cannot enter upon the springs that guide the Russian
Government or the course It is likely to take, nor can I dis
cufs the health of the Ameer of Afghanistan. As, to whether
cur forces are adequate for the work In South ; Africa or
whether It Is true that the Government has always been too
!ate and has neglected opportunities I would gladly accept a
challenge, provided the words would not gt> ' beyond this
chamber. The present troubles are not due to the expansion
of the empire, but to miscalculations made in 1881 and In 1884.
Cur forefathers were, not discouraged, by bad beginnings,
and we should follow their, example and -not be, cast down.
The Government â¢Is convinced now, as ' it : always \ has been,
that the Issue will be brought to a successful conclusion. I
don't think any advantage is to bo obtained from taking a
LOXOON*. Feb. 15.â 1n the Ilcuse of Lords the Earl of
Dunraven raised a question on the Government mil
itary proposals Â»nd expressed a doubt as to whi'th^r
these were sufficient. The Earl of Roscbery soli he
fully reeogYilzed the gravity of the- situation and
agreed with the previous speaker in thinking that
the measures adopted were Inadequate under the clrcum
stances. He also doubted whether the "paper force of 403.
000 men In Great Britain," to which the Secretary ,Â°f State
for War had referred, would stand analysis.; For the volun
teer* Lord Rosebery said he had the highest respect, but by
no, stretch of the. imagination could they be. called soldiers,
as It wa^ admitted that they, needed months of training: an
nually to render them efficient.
"The auspicious news of the morning from . South Af- '
rica." said Lord Rosebery. "led to the hope that there might
be better news to come, but when fighting on our own terri
tory we have been unable before to advance- an inch." and if
k another M>,ooo men should be wanted for South. Africa I do

JUSTICE G. W. SIMPTOX.BARNES LOSES THE LEAD.

As-You-Pleasa Eace.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 15.â The six-day
go-as-you-please race at Clark's Nata
torium is drawing to a close and the con
test has narrowed down to a three-cor
nered fight between Cox, Barnes and
Day. Barnes secured the lead from
Hegelman Tuesday rooming and led the
procession until 11:30 o'clock last night.
when he was passed by Cox. Day has
closed up a big gap in the past three days
and he is gaining, rapidly on the leaders.
The pace set to-day by Cox was a fast
one, the men running almost continually.
The score at 11 o'clock to-night follows:
Cox, 460.12; Barnes, 457.9; Day. 454.10;

"Did you ever stay at a hotel there with

"I am sure that I never did."
"Did you ever register at a hotel in Bnu-

"Certainly not. We were desirous of co

would have been Filly for us to have reg

stances,"
"You are sure that you never registered

teir*
"Perfectly sure." .
Tfien followed a long line of questions
tending to show that Senator Fair and
the witness had lived together as man
and wife. She admitted that such was
the case and stated that at Â£23 Butter
street they occupied apartments as man
and wife in 1692. After . more ques

FURTHER ATTACKS
UPON CARNEGIE
Coke Contracts Called
Into Question.
PITTSBURG, Feb. 15.â Although the
suit which H. C. Frick filed Tuesday to
break the binding force of the "ironclad"
agreement and recover from the Carneffie
Steel Company, Limited, the market value
of his holdings in that concern, is the
main line of attack opened by the anti-
Carnegie adherents, the minority stock
holders, who are lined up against the pol
icy of Mr. Carnegie. It is said, are certain
to follow it up with a suit attacking the
validity of the coke contract of the Car
negie Company with the 11. C. Frick Coke
Company. Attorney William B. Rodgers,
although refusing to deny or affirm his
connection with the big case, is commonly
credited with having in charge the prepa
ration of the coke contract end of the
matter. It is expected that this suit will
be filed in Greensburg, as Mr. Flick's at
torneys at that point have been in fre
quent consultation with attorneys repre
senting Mr. Frick in this city. Perhaps
several weeks may elapse before the pa
per are ready for filing.
The sum of money involved In the pro
posed suit is said to run up to a gigantic
figure. The estimated total of the Carne
gie Steel Company's daily consumption-of
\coke is 900 cars. The' Frick Clompany pro
duces about 1500 cars of coke per day, so
that three-fifths of the whole goes to the
steel concern at the low price of $1 35 per
ton. In other words, the Carnegie Steel
Company, It Is alleged, saves from 115,000
to $18,000 a day. With the cost of pro
duction and freight rates and other items
of expense in the manufacture of coke
constantly going up, the minority stock
holders of the coke company say that if
the contract is allowed to run their profits
will be eventually cut almost to nothing.
They will ask the court to annul the
agreement altogether, and relieve them
from a situation that has been forced
upon them by the majority holdings.
There is no proof as yet that service has
been made upon any of the defendants in
the Frick-Carnegle suit. As the defend
.ants are not required to answer earlier
than fifteen days after the bill has been
served upon them some time will elapse
before the plan of the defense becomes
public. Mr. Frick's attorneys have ar
ranged for serving the bill upon all of the
defendants. ~ * .
Attorney McCook said considerable time
would be consumed, as the defendants are
scattered to all parts of the compass. .
It is said by some lawyers that if Mr.
Frick had stated in his bill that the Car
negie Company was a limited partnership
it would not have been necessary for sep
arate service to be made upon each of tlie
defendants. - Mr. Frick, however, made
the charge that the corporation is a gen
eral partnership, and therefore each sepa
rate partner must be served.
It was stated to-day that President
Schwab had not gone to Florida and that
he would return to the city on Saturday.
SUBSTITUTE CURRENCY
BILL PASSES SENATE
Amendments Considered Under Ten-
Minute Rule and Two of Them
Adopted.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â The Senate
substitute for the House currency bill wa3
passed by the Senate to-day by the de
cisive majority of 46 to 29. Prior to the
final passage Of the bill amendments were
considered under the ten-minute rule.
Only two of these amendments were
adopted', viz., one offered by. the Finance
Committee, keeping the door open to In
ternational bimetallism, and one by Nel
son oX Minnesota providing for national
banks with $25,000 capital In towns of not
more than 4000 inhabitants.
The votes taken on the various amend
ments offered were practically along party
lines. Chandler (R.) of JCew Hampshire
voted for the bimetallic amendment, but
agajnst the bill. Caffery (D.) of Louisiana
and Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky voted
against the committee amendment, but for
the bill. Kyle of South Dakota was the
only Senator who did not vote and waa
not paired. The free silver substitute of
fered by Jones, the leader of the Demo
cratic side, was defeated by a majority
of 19, the vote being 47 to 28.
The bill as passed consists of ten sec
tions. It provides that the dollar of 23 8-10
grains of gold, nine-tenths fine, shall be
the standard unit of value and that all
forms of United States money shall be
maintained at a parity with It. and that
treasury notes and greenbacks shall be
redeemable In gold. The Secretary of the
Treasury ia to set apart a fund of $150,
000,000 in gold for the redemption of these
notes and to maintain this fund at a fig
ure not below $IQQ,OOQ,QOO he is empowered,
to sell bonds of the United States bearing
Interest at not exceeding 3 per cent. It
shall also be the duty of the Secretary of
the Treasury as fast as standard silver
dollars are coined to retire an equal
amount of the treasury notes and to Is
sue silver certificates against the silver
so coined. Under certain provisions, too,
gold certificates shall be isaued against
the gold held In the treasury. No United
States notes or treasury notes shall be
issued in denominations of less than flO
and no silver certificates In denominations
of more than $10. The Secretary of tho
Treasury Is also authorized to refund the
bonded debt of the United States In thirty
year bonds bearing 2 per cent Interest, tho
principal and interest of these bonds to
be paid in gold.
The 2 per cent bonds shall be Issued
at not less than par. Any national bank,
by depositing with the United States
bonds of this country, shall be per
mitted to issue circulating notes to the
face value of the bonds deposited, no
bank being allowed to Issue circulating
notes In excess of the amount of the
paid-in capital stock of the bank.
After the passage of the financial bill
the Senate made the Hawaiian govern
ment bill the unfinished business.
When the routine business was con
cluded the financial bill was laid before
the Senate, the pending question being
the amendment offered by the Finance
Committee and reading as follows:
The provisions of this act are not intended
to place any obstacles in the way of the ac
complishment of International bimetallism, pro
vided the came be secured by concurrent ac
tion of the leading commercial nations of tha
world and at a ratio which shall Insure per
manence of the relative value between gold
and silver.
Hoar of Massachusetts said the double
standard of gold and silver had not only
been accepted by the people, but had
been embodied in the constitution Itself.
But when, by the action of other nations,
this country was forced to accept a sin
gle standard, it was forced to accept the
most valuable metal. We should get the
double standard when the opportunity
came. There waa, therefore, no pretense
or hypocrisy in the pending amendment.
Morgan of Alabama denounced tbe
pending amendment" "a*' 'a ' mlseratte
makeshift, -which is intended to cover the
laceration of a wounded conscience."
He declared the bill would return us
to the British system of finance.
Platt of Connecticut said that what
ever may be said about "imperialism" or
the "tolling masses," the issue will be the
same as four years ago â whether or not
we shall have a silver standard in the
United States.
Cockrell declared that "the crime of
*73 was a crime against man. against
God. against humanity and against
Christianity."
As a \'ote was about to be taken on the
committee amendment Teller offered the
following sutetltute for it: Â»
The people of the United States are in fa
vor of bimetallism and desirous of an inter
national arreement with the great commer
cial nations of the world that will admit of
the use of both gold and silver coins, and the
efforts of the Government are hereby pledged
to endeavor to secure such an International
agreement as speedily as possible.
Platt of Connecticut said he wanted to
protest against the assumption of the
Democratic side that it represented the
American people: That question had been
decided against the Democracy In 1596.
He was obliged, he said, to Cockrell for
proclaiming the leading doctrine and the
leading representative of Democracy dur
ing this year's campaign. . .-'
"Whatever may be said about impe
rialism 1 or about 4 the toiling masses,
said Platt. "It will be the same issue over
again in the campaign of this yearâ
and that is whether we shall have a Sil

Referring to Cockrell's statement that
the United States could maintain the sil

Platt said:
"We have heard something: about al

of the performances of the world's ma
gicians, but It has remained for the wiz
ard of Missouri (Cockrell) to wave hi 3
magic wand or his magic head and dou
ble the price of the silver of the world.
Replying to Platt, Teller said the silver
people were willing to make thia cam
paign on the silver question, and if tho
American people declared for the gold
Standard he should bo ready to accept tho
Ve CoCkfell replied to Platt, maintaining
that legislation alone with the power of
the Government behind Â»t was sufficient
to restore the commercial and monetary
parity of gold and sliver.
As the vote was about to bÂ« taken on
the committee amendment Teller offered
the following substitute for It:
The people of the United States ara in favor
Of bimetallism and desirous of an International
agreement with the great commercial nations
of tha world that will admit of the use of both
itold and silver at such an established ratio as
will maintain the parity between gold and Â»ilver
coins, and the efforts of the Government ara
hereby pledged to endeavor to secure such an
international agreement as speedily as possible.
The amendment of Teller was defeated,
27 to 45. the vote being alone party lints
except that Chandler (Republican) of New
Hampshire voted for the amendment a.nrl
Caffery of Louisiana and Lindsay of
Kentucky (Democrats) against it.
A vote was then taken on the commit

Another amendment by Pettus, provid

the legal tender quality of United State*
silver dollars, was likewise defeated. 41 to

Vest of Missouri offered an amendment
providing for f200.000.000 of treasury tond
notes, which should be loaned by the Sec

Vest sharply arraigned Secretary QÂ»**
for his action in relation to the National
City Bank of New York, saying the letter

The amendment was defeated without

ATTEMPT TO BRIBE A
SUPREME COURT JUDGE
The dark Senatorship" Investigation
Brings Forth Evidence of a
Sensational Nature.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â The Senate
Committee oa Elections to-day resumed
its Inquiry Into the election of Senator
(.".ark of Montana, after a respite of
thirty-six hours. When the committee
was called to order, it developed that at
least two of the Justices of the Mon
tana Supreme Court were present, hav
ing been summoned by the committee to
throw lifrht upon the Wellcome disbar
ment trial.
The Dm witness was Edward B. Coyne,
Jurlfre of the County Court of Livingston
OounyJ New York, who testified concern
ing a conversation lie had in New York
City last October with Mark Hewitt, a
witness Tor the prosecution m this case.
He said Mr. Hewitt had spoken of the
Wclleome disbarment case and. In re
sponse to an inquiry, had said that Well
come "did not f tand a ghost of a chance,"
and would Tic disbarred. He said that v
did not make any difference whether or
not Welleamo was Rullty of the offense
charged, as Daly owned "the court and
the cape was bting conducted with a view
to getting testimony In the Clark case
that was to come before tho l"nitÂ«d States
Senate. The Daly people were. Hewitt
was represented to have said, "deter
mined to defeat Clark, and would not
PtOP at anything to accomplish the re
mit.** The witness aiso had expressed
the opinion that Daly had put up ?:Â«,
wk) used by Mr. Whiteside in his expo
surt.
On cross-examination. Mr. Coyne said
that he had known Mr. Wellcome so
cia.lly.
Before his examination was concluded
Coyne was cicusrd te mporariiy. in order
to permit the Justices of the Montana
Supreme Court to testify in order not to
(Main ihcrr.. Justice Hunt's testimony
crtated a profound impression. He <se
tailtd four different conversations he had
h.ad with h:e family physician. Dr. Wil
liam Tracey of Helena, in two of which
he believed the doctor had attempted to
lay before him a proposition to bribe him
In the Wellcome disbarment case, wnii-h
was at that time before the court of
which witness was a member. The first
of these conversations had occurred on
the oth of last August in Mr. Tracey's
oflice. The court had then held that It
had jurisdiction in the disbarment pro
ceedings, and he went to L)r. Tracey's
office at the invitation of the latter.
"When I went to his office." said the
witness. "Dr. Tracey invited me to a oacn
room. He said :
" 'I have a funny kind of a proposition
which has come up for you." "
The doctor thrn went on to tell, accord
inp to Judge Hunts statement, that ht
doctor* was taking an Interest in the
Welcome case, which he said he under
stood was not liko ordinary cases in court.
He had bi-t-n told, hi- said, that it was
largely a matter in the discretion of the
members of the court, continuing that he
understood the disbarment proctedings to
le a political fight largely, and adding
that, while he did not know Mr. Wcilcoma,
he understood that he was a decent fol
low. Judge Hunt said that he had replied
to all this to the effect that while there
Â¦was a certain amount of leyral discretion
permitted, the case would have to take its
rourse just as any other case. He felt that
it was a painful" duty, because he knew
Mr. Wellcome's reputation, and altogether
he would gladly avoid acting If he could.
Dr. Tracey then said to him, according Xo
the witness:
"I don't suppose, then, there is any use
to lay my proposition before you."
Without, however, waiting for any
forma! reply, the witness saia the doctor
had proceeded as follows:
"There is a party here who has got 1139.
0 M and who wants to put it up if that case
can be thrown out of court."
Justice Hunt paid that he was not cer
tain whether Dr. Tracey had used the sin
gular or plural pronoun in speaking of the
partyâ "not pure whether he or th*y."
Justice Hunt said that he had replied to
Dr. Tracf-y that "not all the money in vhe
X'nited States and Anaconda mines to
gether, with every dollar that Daly and
Clark are both worth and that there is
In the banks, wculd induce me to sacrifice
my conscience to the extent of granting
additional time in this or any other ca'-e.
The Wellcome case must co forward just
B.? any other case would."
Justice Hunt said he had then gone to
nip home and that in the afternoon Dr.
Tracey had come to his home and sought
another Interview, saying that he under
stood that one of the Supreme Court
Justice? had be?n secured in favor of the
proposition which had previously been
made. To thl* Justice Hunt said he had
replied that he did not believe this to
r-.'* true, as he considered both the Chief
Justice and the Associate Justice. Mr.
Piggott, men beyond reproach. After this
Dr. ' Tracey had taken a memorandum
book from his pocket and appeared to
read from it a memorandum stating that
he (the doctor) had understood that Mr.
Daly had ast-urod the re-election of the
Justice. To this Justice Hunt said he had
replied that Mr. Daly had never assured
him of anything. He added that Mr.
Daly had opposed his original election
and that the only reason for supposing
that he and Daly were now on pood tfrms
was found in the fact that some of their
ohildren were very intimate. After this
Dr. Traroy had continued by saying that
"all they want Is a fair fhow," and "I
toM him," continued the witness, "that
under any circumstances they could
count upon thaL"
I Justice Hunt said that after this Dr.
Tracey had made an appeal to him to get
off the bt-nch on account of his health, he
having bern threatened with lung trouble;
That the doctor told him that If he con
tinued he was sure to break down, as the
position was very laborious. If he -would
accept tho proposition he could take a
rest, go abroad, visit the Paris Exposl-
tion. hare nothing to worry about and
thus Indefinitely prolong his life.
Judge Hunt said that he had replied
that lie much appreciated what the doctor
said about getting off the bench, but he
could not see his way clear to accept the
proposition. The doctor then went away,
paying that he would not have Justice
Hunt do anything which ho did not think
was right.
The matter did not come up between
them again until November 14, when he
met Dr. Tracey on the street and the
latter asked him if no change had come
over his mind. Justice Hunt said that no
had replied in the negative, saying he had
supposed that their last conversation had
ended the matter betweeen them, as he
would not swerve from his position "to
pave my own life or the lives of my chil
dren."
The doctor then said that he was glad
that this was tho decision of the Judge.
and nothing had been Faid concerning the
subject until Sunday night, February 4.
At this time Dr. Tracey had asked him
to come to his (the doctor's) office late
that evening. 'â¢ He went there, and Dr.
Tracev showed him what was apparently
a copy of a telegram which informed the
doctor that some one had told the Senate
Committee in Washington that the Jus
tice would testify before the committee
that Dr. Tracey had offered him a bribe
of $100,000 in the Wellcome case. The doc
tor then said:
"You know I never offered you a bribe
and that I was only joking In 1 our con
versations concerning the Wellcome case.
You know I had no $100,000 with which to
bribe you. and I am not one of that kind
of fellows."
Justice Hunt said he had replied to Dr.
Tracey that he wished he could believe
that he was only joking, but that he
could not put that construction on the
proposition. . He did not, however, be
lieve that Dr. Tracey meant to actually
bribe him, but simply to lay the proposi
tion before him.
In answer to questions from the mem
bers of the committee Justice Hunt said
he thought Dr. Tracey had mentioned
Senator Clark's name In the first con
versation when he had spoken of the
Wellcome case as merely a political fight
between Mr. Clark and Mr. Daly.
He had firm related the fact of the
propositions being made to him on the
night of August 5, when his associate,
Justice Piggott. had come to his house
and related that he had been approached
on the same day.
At the close of the direct examination,
which had been conducted almost entire
ly by Chairman Chandler, Mr. Faulkner,
on behalf of Senator Clark, made a for
mal motion to strike out the testimony of
Justice Hunt fiom the record because It
had failed to connect the name of Mr.
Clark with the proceedings and was en
tirely collateral.
The motion .was overruled and the
cross-examination proceeded.
At the night session of the Senate Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections Jus
tice William T. Piggott, another member
of the bench of the Montana Supreme
Court, was heard. He was questioned by
Senator Chandler. His testimony was re
lated In a slow and impressive manner.
It was on. different lines irom that of Jus
tice Hunt, but received equally close at
tention. Mr< Piggotfs statement covered
an interview with Frank E. Corbett of
Butte, who is Mr. Clark's principal West
ern counsel, which had occurred on the
sth of August last, the same day as Dr.
Tracey's first two interviews with Justice
Hunt. He eaid that he met Mr. Corbett
on the street and the latter told him that
he had come from Helena in a special
train to see him and requested a private
interview. He had taken Mr. Corbett to
his rooms at the Capitol, when Corbett
had told him that J. S. M. Neill of Helena
had telephoned to Butte that the Supreme
Court might be influenced in the Well
come case. Detailing the conversation,
Mr. Piggott said Mr. Corbett apparently
was very much excited; his lips were
trembling .and his manner was very nerv-
OUF..
"Sitting opposite me," said the witness,
"he said he did not want me to get angry
at what he was about to tell me. He then
told me of the receipt of the telephonic
message from Mr. Neill, which had been
as follows:
"' "We can do business with the Supreme
Court."
"He said he had spent two or three
hours with Mr. JCelll." resumed the wit
ness, "and that the latter had said to him,
â¢We can get the Supreme Court. They
will come high and the scheme will have
to be capitalized for five millions.' lie
then proceeded to say that he had applied
various -opprobrious epithets to Mr. Nclll
for such a presumption, saying that he
had secured a special train and come from
Butte for the purpose of heading off any
effort In the line of such an outrageoua
| proceeding, and to assure me that if ary
' thing of the kind was undertaken he had
nothing to do with it.
" 'If ne undertakes to do that I will my-
Felf pet up in the Supreme Court and tcil
what I know about the proceedings. I
! have a mind to do that anyway,' Mr. Cor
i bett added.
"I replied." continued tha witness.
| " 'you can rest assured that 1Â£ Nelll ap
proaches me in the way you su&gest you
will never know it, nor will the fact be
come public, for I consider such an attack
upon a man's official integrity more se
rious than an attack upon his life, and I
believe that a man making such an attack
should be killed by the man to whom he
had made the preposition. I will endeavor
to do that if so approached. I. never would
have a man arrested for such a proceea
iner. for I would not want the publicity,
nor would I want to bring a court into dis-
Justice Piggott said that after this in
terview Corbett left him. paying he had
to hurry to the train, but that more than
half an hour afterward he had seen that
gentleman and two others leaving for the
train.

PERJURY'S TRAIL IN
THE FAIR WILL CASE
was married. It was only a short while,
however, until It could be seen that the
motive was deeper than appeared at first
dance. From the tenor of the questions
It teemed that Attorney Plerson -was en
deavorlng to establish the fact that Mrs.
Craven had been a resident of this city
at the time ehe was granted a divorce
from her husband in Alameda County.
If Buch were the intent of the cross-exam
ination It dismally failed in Its -purpose.
The witness answered the queries In a
way indicative of a belief that such was
the object of the counsel for the opposi
tion, and would not be led across the
danger line. ': .'. v
The only question in which she faltered
was caused by a feminine aversion to re
vealing the date of her birth, but she re
luctantly admitted that she Â¦was born in
Cleveland. Ohio, fifty-three years ago. At
four years of age she waÂ» removed with
her father to Washington, lowa, and was
married to Andrew Craven when she was
14 years old. She came to California Im
mediately afterward, where she and her
husband first took up their residence with
Warren Olney. Craven's brothÂ»er-in-law.
While living there she completed her edu
cation at the local hlsh school. Â«?52$iB
Mrs. Craven was taken Into the mlnut
ept details of her life In this city. She
had to enumerate the various hotels, flats
and houses in which she had lived, the
length of time in each, the dates of mov
ing from one, to the other, the people
whom she met, who paid for her main
tenance and the rental In each instance.
It was sparring for time and It answered
Us purpose. Mrs. Craven was ablo to
remember a good deal and fortified her
lapses of memory by a statement that
ex-Chief of Police Lees had taken her
private records from her school while she
was on a visit In the East. This, she said,
occurred about four years ago. Upon ob-
Jectlon by Attorney McEnerney. her tes-
tlmony on this point was ruled out. Ex-
Chief I^ees -was present and reddened un
comfortably under the charges made by
Mrs. Craven. She referred to the loss
of her books many times during the ex
aminatlon and seemed to take a keen de
llg-ht In seeing: the effect It produced each
time the subject was mentioned. Plerson
once asked a question leading up to the
same subject and promptly withdrew" It
when the first words of, Mrs. Craven's
answer gave an Inkling of what was com
ing, but Attorney Pence made such vig
orous objection that she waa permitted to
finish speaking, though her testimony in
this respect was again cut out.
"And even If I saw the records ag-aln,"
said Mrs. Craven, In concluding her vlt
rlolic reply, "I Â¦was afraid to trust to
them longer for matters of fact, dates
or anything else."
On another occasion Mrs. Craven enliv
ened the proceedings by stating that at
one time she had lived in a lodging--hou.se
kept by. Mrs. Wheeler, the mother of At
torney Wheeler, one of the opposing coun
sel. As she did so a slight smile illumined
her face and she glanced slyly at Whoelor
to see what effect the statement had upon
him.
A recess was then taken until 2 o'clock in
the afternoon, when Mrs. Craven resumed
her testimony. The questions of Attorney
Plerson were along the same lines as In
the morning. After answering several Mrs.
Craven suddenly announced her desire to
consult with Attorney Pence, and upon
Judge Troutt granting the privilege they
held a hurried whispered conference, at
the conclusion of which â¢Attorney Pence
held a brief conversation In low tones
with Attorney McEnerney. Pence then
asked the court to .take an adjournment
as his client felt ill and Attorney Mc
'Enerncy had agreed to a continuance. 1 His
Honor stated that he would not bo willing
for any other witness to be examined un
til Mrs. Craven had finished, and con
tinued the case until next Monday at 2
P. m.
It seems that certain, books now In the
possession of the Fair contingent are
wanted as evidence by Mrs. Craven's
side, and after Borne talk about 'the In
ability of officers to serve subpenas on
the executors it developed that they ore
in the hands of counsel for the defense
Accordingly Attorney Pence declared that
he would have subpenas served upon
counsel to produce the books in court next
Monday- ... . ,

Advocates More Divisions.
LONDON, Feb. 15.â Spencer Wilkinson,
in the Morning Post to-day, advocates the
advisability of forming tenth, eleventh
and twelfth divisions and sending them to
the Cape to be ready for each emergency,
as well as the formation and training at
home of as many additional battalions as
possible. He says: "Lord Rosebery's
speech in the House of Lords last evening
probably expresses the universal feeling
and the universal temper, and it will do
great good in arousing the country. Lord
Roeebery Is to be congratulated upon urg
ing the necessity of preparing the navy."
Damming Klip River.
LONDON. Feb. 15. â The Dally Mall
has the following dispatch from Lourenzo
Marquez, dated Wednesday:
"A prominent Pretoria citizen, Just from
Ladysmith, Informs me that the Boers
are rapidly damming Klip River. Two
thousand Kaffirs are employed in the
work and they have deposited 10,000 sand
bags already. They are "only able to
work at night, as they would be under
British fire. This citizen, however, be
lleves that the operation will be futile."
Munitions Still Passing.
LONDON, Feb. 15.â The correspondent
of the Times at Lourenzo Marquez tele
gratfilng Wednesday says:
"The republics are now obtaining' subr
stantial supplies of sugar, coffee and flour

150 visiting delegates, representing Sacra
mento, Marysville. Chico. Dlxon - and
Winters parlors, are expected to be pres
ent.
Northcote temporarily commands the
fourth division."
Fears regarding a Boer attack on Zulu
land are somewhat allayed by a special
dispatch from Durban, which says that a
column of colonial scouts after a forced
march has arrived at Eshowe in splen
did fighting form. They, were pursued
several times during the march by the
Boers, but. succeeded In repulsing them.
The official list of British casualties at
Rensberg from February 10 to February
12 shows: Killed, four officers and seven
men; wounded, six officers and fourteen
men; missing, two officers and eight men.
The officers killed were Colonel Conyng

ZULUS MAY BE ARMED
TO FIGHT THE BOERS
LONDON, Feb. 15.-In the House of
Commons to-day during the course of a
reply to a question relative to the prob
able Boer invasion of Zululand, the Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, Joseph
Chamberlain, said that the Government
had decided that if the native territories
were invaded by the Boers the natives
"would be encouraged and assisted in
every way In defending themselves."
Chamberlain's reply confirmed the re
ports of the invasion of Zululand, and
showed the consequences could not Tall to
be serious throughout South Africa, aa
the alarm and unrest of the Zulus was
bound to spread to the Natal natives. The
Colonial Secretary also said that the Na
tal- Ministry had notified the home Gov
ernment that it could not any longer be
responsible for the peaceful attitude of
the Zulus, as the Invasion of their coun
try was contrary to a tacit compact that
the natives should not be dragged into the
war.
Mr. Balfour. the Government leader,
dealing with the same subject and the
possibility of employing Indian troops,
eaid his former statement to the tffect
that the Government would not employ
natives in the present war was based on
the belief that by common consent the
war would be confined to the two
EJuropean races, adding: "If the Boers
adopt a course Inconsistent with the idea
we hold ourselves free to reconsider our
decision." "*
BRITAIN'S MILITARY
SCHEME IS ADOPTED
LONDON, Feb. 15.â The House of Com

ment's military scheme by a vote of 233

of Irish members.
When the House went into committee
of supply on the supplementary -war es
timates William Redmond, Nationalist

to adding a single man to the British
army, which, he said, was now -engaged
In a. -war which Is an Insult to God. a war
waged by Christian England against a
Christian people who only desire to re

belief that the British reverses were duo

Bloody Battle.
FRENCH LOSS HEAVY
Commander of the Expedition Ad
mits That Half His Force Was

PARIS, Feb. 15.â M. de Crals, Minister
of the Colonies, has received a telegram
from the Governor of the French Congo,
M. de Lamothe, announcing the defeat
In battle of Rabah. the principal chief

Rabah has long been the strongest op

a Blave of Zebehr Fasha, himself a great
Soudan ' ruler, but revolted and formed
a kingdom of his own in Central Africa,
subjugating potentate after potentate un
til he became the head of a vast empire.
His career of victory gained for him tho
name of the "African .Napoleon." The
French have been fighting his power for
years, and to-day's dispatch announces
his overthrow.
It appears that he was Btrongly in
trenched at Kouna. between the French
Congo and Lake Tchad, which Is the ob
jective of aJI French expeditions, whether
across the Sahara from Algeria or from
the French colonies in "West Africa ajid
the Congo. Kouna was defended by 12,000
men, with 2500 rifles and three cannon.
After a dtsperate fight, according to the
dispatch, the French demolished the fort
ress. Two of Rabah's cannon were de
stroyed by the French shells, llabah., who
was wounded during the fight, fled six
hours before its conclusion.
The commander of the French expedi
tion, however, admits that fully half of
his own force was placed hors de com
bat. Forty-three Senegalese sharpshoot
ers were killed and four Europeans, in
cluding Captain Robillot., and 106 Sene
galese were wounded.
The commander of the expedition Bays
In his report: "We had altogether only
330 rifles, so I thought it inadvisable to
continue the march to Lake Tchad. Cap
tain Robillot occupies a fortified'canton
ment at Tounla."
The commander of the expedition re
turned to Bangue to inform the Governor
of the defeat of Rabah. He reports that
the result will be very Important, as
Rabah is completely demoralized by his
losses, estimated at between 2000 and 3000
killed. Rabah Is fleeing almost alone to
the north. The Sultan of Bagrulrml, a
large territory hitherto overawed by
Rabah, has joined Captain Robillot, and
the route to Lake Tchad has been opened
up for a steamer along- the river Chari.
The Governor has sent reinforcements
of Senegalese sharpshooters to enable the
commander of the expedition to continue
the march.

OBJECTED TO
PASTOR'S VIEWS
So Huntington Quits His
Church.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.-Collis P. Hun*
ington and his family no longer attend
service at St. Peter's Protestant Episco
pal Church, "West Chester, because the
views of Mr. Huntington and the rector.
Rev. Dr. Clendenin. do not ccilncide.
Formerly the rector and the millionaire
were on very good terms and Mr. Hunt
ington has given in all more than $10,000
to the church.
There were most cordial relations be
tween Rev. Mr. Clendenin and Mr Hunt
ington some years ago. Mrs. Clendenin.
whom Mrs. Huntlngton has known since
her childhood, was a frequent visitor at
the handsome residence of the Huntine
t( ?J\? at . T hrogga Neck. Mr. Huntington,
although he Is not himself a churchman
is opposed to extreme views of any kind
and for this reason the two men could'
not agree.
The rector made a determined Â¦ attack
upon the saloons of "West Chester several
years ago. Mr. Huntington. it is under
stood, does not believe in attacking the
saloon so long 1 as the proprietors keep
within the law. Further back, the West
Chester free hospital was closed on ac
count of a controversy started by the rec
tor, who insisted that half of the hos
pital be given over to Homeopathic phy
sicians.
"There has been no serious disagree
ment between Mr. Huntington and my.
self," said the rector. "I have not been
talking against trusts and money power
It fs possible that some of the leisure
clas3 do not like my teachings, but I al
ways regarded Mr. Huntlngton as very
democratic."
GENERAL HARRISON WAS
ROBBED IN PARIS
INDIANAPOLIS. Feb. 15.â 1t Is being
related here to-night that both ex-Presl
der.t Harrison and his wife were systemat
ically robbed and otherwise swindled dur
ing their visit to Paris last summer, when
the general wa^ engaged In the Venezue
lan claims affair. The ex-President waa
asked about the matter to-night and ha
confirmed the etory, although he said he
did not know that It was abroad and did
not authorize it. He now thinks that a
young Frenchman who acted as his valet
was the swindler, or if not that he knew
all about the larcenies. Aside from sums
of money that the ex-President missed,
the boldest and most accomplished opera
tion consisted in a series of forgeries iier
jttrated on Mrs. Harrison. During the
simmer Bhe looked for drafts due on seme
prvate Investments of her own. Â¦ They
nrtpr came. Quite recently they came to
heilwith her name fairly well Indorsed on
the*. The amounts of the various drafts
and ihe name of the forger could nut be
leaned- General Harrison would grlvo no
detal^ beyond saying that the story waa
Eubst:*tially correct. :

CHARLES P. GROTE.
that a search of the records failed to show
Mr. Macrum had ever reported to the de
partment that his official mail was be
ing regularly tampered with by the Brit
ish authorities. It was said that he did.
in a general way, report that both offi
cial and private mall, Intended for Ameri
can citizens, did not reach him punctually
and asked that protest be made on ac
count of this rather arbitrary proceeding
on the part of the postal authorities. The
department investigated the matter and
learned that no unnecessary delay existed
and does not credit the statement that
any correspondence, official or Otherwise,
was opened, inspected and delayed by
British authorities.
Mr. Macrum stated that his Vice Con
sul, Mr. Van Amerfngen, closed up his
business, took the oath of allegiance to
the republic and went to the front as a
burgher. The records show that when
m Â«? Van . Ame Â£ Ingen1 ngen applied for appoint
ment as Vice-Consul at Pretoria he stated
that he was born In Holland; that hia
legal residence was at Pretoria and that
he was a naturalized citizen of the South
Â£\ > Tv r f pi f Ilc <. TWs application was
dated Pretoria. November 12. IS9S.
MACRUM HAD
NO AUTHORITY IN
SOUTH AFRICA
"Charles E. Macrum should have the
commendation of all the American peo
ple. He is a noble man and was Bimply
forced to leave Pretoria because our Gov
ernment made him act more as a Britleh
than an American representative."
This statement was made yesterday by
Charles F. Grote. an American citizen of
German descent, who reached this city
January 11 after a residence of two years
and a half in the Transvaal. Mr. Grote
Is an Intelligent, earnest appearing man.
and he is very bitter over the manner
In which he and other Americans have
been treated in the Transvaal, all due,
he declares, to the restriction of power
on the part of our Consuls there in the
Interests of England.
Grote says that he haÂ» been forced to
travel half-way around the world In order
to merely secure a duplicate of his citi
zenship papers w Â£! cn would permit him
to remain in the Transvaal. He cam* to
America from Hanover when 16 years of
age and was admitted to citizenship in
this city in ISSB. He is a machinist by
trade and worked for years in various
coast cities, including Oakland and San
Francisco. Having procured a certificate
of his naturalization he will depart aeain
for the Transvaal.
"I had saved up about $800 or $1000
during my stay in Africa." said Grote
yesterday, "and most of it will be spent
on the long trip over and back, which
would have been utterly unnecessary had
our representatives In South Africa not
been tied down so.
"I was working as machinist at a mine
near Johannesburg at J5 a day when the
war broke out. and all foreigners were
ordered to get out unless they could ob
tain official permission to stayâ the Brit
ish subjects from the Transvaal Govern
ment Itself and all others from their re
spective 'Consuls. I had been robbed
some time before of some documents In
cluding my naturalization papers. '
"Wishing to stay In the country, I went
to the Vice Consul at Johannesburg and
explained my predicament to him He
said he could do nothing- for me. I called
on the LandroÃt at Johannesburg, and
he eaid I could stay if I got a Consular
permit.
"I then went to Consul Macrum at Pre
toria and told him my story. He said
after hearing It: 'Grote. I feel as sure as
I am of anything that you are an Ameri
can citizen, and I am willing to let you
stay, and am anxious that you should
but I am so bound down that I can do
nothing. â¢ Even my telegrams to my own
Government are not answered. My coun
try will not give me enough authority to
do many things that I should doâ not
enough to properly look after the Inter
ests of those of my fellow-countrymen
who look to me for assistance.*
"Mr. Macrum seemed much exercised
over the position he was in and asked me
if I g-ot to America to tell the people how
matters stood. When I heard he had left
Pretoria I knew exactly why It was
"The Boera are a noble, honest people
Why. after I found I must g-et out of the
country because I could not prove my cJt
lzenship I went to the Postal Savincs
Bank in Pretoria, conducted by the Gov
ernment, and asked for'JSOO I had depos
ited there. They said if I was going to re
main in the country I could deposit but
not withdraw. When I told them l' was'
going to leave they gave me all my
money. 'That looks like honesty, doesn't
"Those who were ordered "from the
Transvaal were treated like beasts while
being conveyed by the English companies
from Delagoa Bay to Cape Town." Grote
declared.
Grote will make an open statement to
night before the Transvaal Relief Com
mittee, In the Phelan building, , of. wbat
he knowi_of_ South AjWcan attain. .

WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.-Respond-
Ing to the Senate's resolution of
January 17. the President to-day
sent to the Senate a report from
the Secretary of State, accompanying pa
pers showing the steps that have been
taken to obtain the restitution of prop
erty of American citizens seized by the
military authorities of Great Britain in
or near Delagoa Bay, South Africa. The
report consists entirely of correspondence
between the State Department and Em
bassador Choate and the British Govern
ment. The fact that the flour received
had been released was published.
The correspondence begins with the- re
port of Consul General Stowe, located at
Cape Town, made on December 6. and re
lating to the detention of the British ship
Maria and the seizure of the British ship
Mashona and also the Beatrice, all carry
ing American flour and other foodstuffs
lor the ' Transvaal. These acts were
brought to the notice of Embassador
Choate by Secretary Hay on December 21,
when the latter was instructed "to bring 1
the matter to the attention of the British
Government and to inquire as to the cir
cumstances and legality of the seizure,"
He added: "If It was illegal you will re
quest prompt action and restitution."
Consul Hollis, at Lourenzo Marquez,
was instructed at the same time "to use
all proper efforts to protect the property
of American shippers."
Mr. Choate's- first note, dated January
1. relates to the American flour on the
Mashona, and he says in this that the
vessel was brought into the prize court
"on the charge of trading with the
enemy."
On January 2 Mr. Choate waa Instructed
by Mr. Hay to the effect that he should
'â¢represent the views of this Government
to be that unless it can be ehown that
the goods were contraband It does not
regard them as subject to capture under
the circumstances represented."
On January 4 Mr. Choate reported a
conference with Lord Salisbury, who, he
fald. claimed that the Maria and the
MasSona had been seized for violation of
the municipal law of Great Britain, the
seizure being merely an incidental matter
and that Lord Salisbury knew nothing of
On the 10th of that month Mr. Choate
transmitted particulars concerning the at
titude of the British Government, Baying
that Lord Salisbury did not claim that
any of the American goods seized were
contraband, the position of the British
Government being that "foodstuffs with
a hostile destination can be considered
.contraband only if they are supplies for
the enemy's forces and if it is suffi
cient that they are capable of so be.lng
used."
Mr. Choate reports In this communica
tion Lord Salisbury's suggestion that the
British Government settle the matter by
taking the flour and paying for it at its
price at its destination. Mr. Choate urged
such sale to the British Government as
the simplest and easiest method of settle
ment. This question was still pending,
however, when the correspondence ceased.
On the 17th Mr. Choaie reported that
the cargo of the Beatrice had been dis
charged at East London, and that there
was no allegation against It, no seizure
having been contemplated: that the car
go of the Marie was at Durban free for
its owners to take; that the Mashona
was at Cape Town, but that owing to the
fact that there were no bills of lading
there -was much difficulty in dealing -with
its cargo.
Incidentally Mr. Choate states in a dis
patch of the ISth relating an interview
with Lord Salisbury that "he claims no
blockade or elegre of Delagoa Bay, but
only the right to seize real contraband of
war on the high seas .which Is destined
for the enemy's forces."
On the 26th Mr. Choate reported the
conclusions of the British authorities that
large quantities of the flour carried by
the Beatrice were destined for the South
African republic, making it necessary to
land at East London, as it was Impossible
to discharge this part of the cargo wlth
out discharging the remainder, allowing
removal of parts of the cargo for local
Portuguese consumption.
Secretary Hay took apparent excep
tion to this proceeding, saying it was
"In conflict with the assurances that
foodstuffs with hostile intention are not
contraband of war unless intended as
supplies for the enemy's forces, and In
admlselble from the view of the United
States."
Replying to this point Mr. Choate said
that Lord Salisbury had disclaimed the
purpose indicated.
The correspondence closes with a notice
from Mr. Choate to Mr. Hay of February
9, to the effect tha.t the American, goods
on the Mashona had been placed at the
disposal of the American Consul General
at Cape Colony.

lieved that the Japanese ratcatchers will
take advantage of thi3 offer and will do
much to rid the city of the plague-spread

also set a day apart for the wholesale
slaughter of rats; all householders will
be supplied with packages of poison for

is tHt Sodality Chapel at St.
Ignatius.
The unveiling of the statue of the
Sacred Heart will take place on Sunday
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the Ladies*
Sodality Chapel attached to St. Ignatius
Church. The statue is a work of much
merit by the celebrated sculptors De.en
Freres of Paris, standing five feet high,
and representing Christ through his sa
cred heart pleading for the love of souls.
It will be placed on a pedestal at the left
har.d side of the altar.
The statue will be unveiled <by the
learned and zealous director. Rev. H.
Woods, S. J.. and the ceremonies will be
open to members of the apostleship of
prayer as well as the promoters. The

the sacred heart of Christ, as well as a
society that performs many charitable
works. Itf membership throughout the
world is over seventy-tive millions and in
San Frarcl?oo it numbers some 20,0>>3.
It is noticeable that MY. Clarke says
nothing of the charges of petty larceny
again.Â«t Madeleine Bruguiere and Jane
Plunkett. which were telegraphed to San
Francisco.
Mrs. Bruguiere said:
"I have been with the company since
its opening and have got along motÂ»t
pleasantly with all the members.' There
has been nothing wrong about my ac
tions. I " don't know why Mr. Clarke
should say there has, and besides,! am
not discharged. Thy company is going
to disband. That's all there is to it."
Clarke had charged that she had been
guilty of smoking cigarettes. 'Â¦
"I don't know of anything Mr. Clarke
has against me, and such charges are
not true," she said.
Then she began weeping, paying: "I
cannot say anything more. There Is noth
ing to say," and disappeared.
Mrs. BrugTilere leaves the company thl3
week at Grand Island, >Tebr.. and will
visit wealthy St. Louis relatives. From
there she will go to New York. Mlsa
Plunkett is already In New York. She
declares the whole trouble is due to
Clarke's ' uncontrollable admiration for
herself. Letters dated weeks ago to her
parents and friends speak of the trouble
that is bound to ensue unless Clarke
changes his temper and manners.
Mrs. Corson Clarke has taken a hand in

The Leaveriworth Times has been trying
to get at the inside facts in the much dis
cussed case, and this is the result:
Mr. Clarke explained his position as fol
lows:
"This year I started out with several
new people in the company. We struck
two or three discordant notes, though, in
the selection. I was forced to get rid of
them. My show must be absolutely free
from any such evils. Last week at June-
) lon City I announced after the play that
the company would close the season in
two weeks. 1 meant it. tooâ that is, I meant
It would close fcr some of the members.
That is a perfectly legal thing to do. I
gave them two weeks' notice. It is cus
tomary In the profession. After I made
that public announcement I went around
to the members I wanted and told th<^m
the company would reorganize the day
following the close, and they would go on.
I have dates booked until May.
"We have been making money since the
opening nightâ a barrel of It, and not a
three-cent piece against us.
"But the trouble. You see it Is like thl3.
ve JJ B u t my wlfe (he waved his hand tc
ward her), and several of the troupe wore
people she could not shake hands with.
I told them- the season closes-, and it
does. That>s all there is to it. I have
three new people engaged to take their
parts, co the show will go right on and
everything la like velvet.
"I let out Jane Irwin (Miss Plunkett)
last week. She was one discordant note.
Miss Bruguiere was her boon companion,
and I gave her notice that the season
would close. I have given three others
notice, too.
"Oh, Miss Bruguiere Is well connected.
I got her from the Modjeska company.
Her husband, Pedar Bruguiere. is heir to
a million in San Francisco. She herself
is from one of the best-known families
on the coast. Her father is Judge Mc-
Kisick of San Francisco. She has been
studying for the stage for years, and it
was through choice she Is now with me.
She had been with Modjeska only six
weeks."

BUILDING FIRM
CANNOT SATISFY
HEAVY DEMANDS
Failure of Marcuse &
Remmel.
Because of its inability to meet a claim
of J27.0C3 owing to the Puget Sound Lum
ber Company the real estate and building
firm of Marcuse & Remmel ol Alameda
and this city filed a petition in insol
vency and were adjudged bankrupts yes
terday by Judge J. J. de Haven. The
total liabilities of the firm are 5330,743, of
which $133.500 Is secured by property
scheduled as being worth $157,893, the re
maining $COS 51 being unsecured.
The members of the firm also filed in
dividual petitions and each -was adjuJg-ed
a bankrupt. Felix Marcuse owes J27.C20,
all of which except $370 Is secured. His
assets are set down at $53,721, of which
$4070 is claimed to be exempt.
The petition of Julius A. Remmel shows
that all his debts, amounting- to $6410,. are
secured and that his assets are $11,700,
with property valued at J3550 exempt
from execution.
The proceedingÃ were not a. surprise, as
a month ago it was known that the Puget
Sound Lumber Company had demanded a
settlement and that Marcuse & Remmel
were unable to meet their obligations The
lumber company held a trust deed to
r.early forty pieces of property as security
for their debt, and as ' they had waited
two years for their money they decided
to sell the property and realize on their
security. The sale was set for noon yes
terday, and the insolvent firm, in order
to prevent their securities going- at "a sac
rifice, filed their petitions. The -sale was
held but all the property was bought in
by the Puset Sound Lumber Company,
thus leaving everything, so far as titles
are concerned, in exactly the same condi
tion as before.
The dullness of the realty market in Ala
meda and San Francisco is said to be the
cause of the failure. The Insolvent firm
was engaged for twelve years In building
houses on the installment .plan, and all
the assets are dec-lared to be. good, nl
though they cannot be realized upon for
periods -ranging from one to ten years.
The firm has built 535 bouses durinsj Its
existence and on most of these there is
something owing, although nearly all of
their patrons are keeping their contracts.
Attorney Naphtaly says nobody can lose
one cent, but there will have to be a goo.l
deal of waltinp on the part of creditors.
-With the exception of the. Puget Sound
Lumber Company the average cla.im is
about $3000, each representing the price
of a house and lot. There are also a num
ber of unsecured claims, due to plumbers,
carpenters, newspapers and to holders of
small notes.
The principal creditors are: San Fran
cisco Savings Union, Alameda Savlnscs
Bank, the California. Encinal, Aetna, At
las, Commercial. National, Excelsior,
Humboldu Monarch and Safety bulldtn?
and loan associations, the Pacific Coast
Loan Association and several individuals
whose claims run from $3 to ? 300.
The assots of the firm are scheduled hs
follows: Real estate. 123.315; bills and
promissory notes, $10,436; debts due, *570i{;
stocks. $1400; property In reversion, trusts,

IN NATIVE SONS' HALL
Everything is In readiness for the pre
sentation of Gilbert and Sullivan's tune
ful opera "Pinafore" in Native Sons' Hall
this evening. The members of the Sacred
Heart' Parish Opera Club who are in the
cast have rehearsed their parts and feel
certain they will score as big a hit as they
did on their first presentation of the fa
vorite opera. A large number of tickets
have been disposed of, and It is certain
that the hall will be crowded. The per
formance is given for the benefit of the
parish of Novato. Marin County, of which
Father Byrne is the pastor.
Will Jacobs, who has the part of Cap
tain Corcoran, is a young singer of great
promise. He has a splendid barytone
voice and has for the past few yeara sung
In the Sacred Heart Ohurch choir. He is
but 20 years old and gives promise of scor
ing a success. As Captain Corcoran Mr.
Jacobs will be heard in a number of pop
ular selections.
Miss Miriam Sydney Smith, a dainty lit
tle girl, will dance the sailor's hornpipe
on board the Pinafore.

Unsealed.
MOLiNEUX IS SUSPECTED
CASE AGAINST HIM MAY NEVER

?
NEW YORK. Feb. 13. - If Roland B.
Mollneux had escaped conviction for the
ir.urder of Mrs. Kate Adams he would
have been charged with responsibility for
the death of Henry C. Barnet. The e\l
der.ee for the prosecution on that accusa
tion had been prepared. Now that Molin
eux is to be sentenced to death to-day
(Friday) the reasons for the secrecy hith
erto maintained concerning it are no long
er held.
Edmund H. Barnet, whose lips have
been sealed elnce the death of his brother.
broke 6ilerce for the first time yester
cay ar.d revealed every circmetance with
in bis knowledge. He was a witness In
the poison trial just ended, but under the
rules of evlder.ee was unable to tell his
full story.
Barnet has consistently refueed to talk
on the subject from the time the sugges
tion was first made that his brother died
iroa mercurial poisoning sent to him by
bm. unknown enemy, and not from diph
theria, as Dr. Doug-las, the attending phy
sician, stated. He now makes startling
statements regarding his brother's death.
He eaid that in his opinion H. C. Bar
ret was poisoned and that his brother
Â¦was fully aware of the fact before his
Â«Jeath. He also described a woman who
attended the funeral and who he believed
also knew that his brother had been
poisor.ed.
Starting with his first knowledge of his
brother's illness Mr. Barnet eaid: "My
brother told me before his death that he
felt the need of something to aid digestion
jand he had received from an unknown
source a sample of a. medicine for such a
purpose that morning and he had taken a.
dose, and immediately upon swallowing
It had fallen to the floor vomiting. He
weakened all in a moment, he said, and
was barely able to crawl to the bell rope
in his room and summon assistance. He
said he was a fool to taJce the powder.
He said that It was the third one he had
received from an unknown source, and he
added that Dr. W. C. Phllipps. who was
called In. had taken a sample of the med
icine to see what It contained.
"Later, as the result of an interview
between Dr. Douglas and myself, the doc
tor said he went to my brother's room,
ajjd having made an examination of my
brother told him that he was suffering:
from two things â one a metallic poison
ard the other diphtheria. Dr. Douglas told
me that he haa given to my brother a
lull dozen of antl-toxln for diphtheria,
and an it had taken good effect he was
devoting his time to exterminating the
poison. He told me then that my brother
wa* salivated, which fhowed especially
on the gums, and that he would probably
low? some of his teeth. Dr. Douglas said
the poison was an Irritant and that my
brother had some ulcers In his stomach
fro-n It and that hi? heart was weak, also
a result of the poison. It was after this
interview with Dr. Douglas that I learned
the powder had been analyzed and found
to contain cyanide of mercury."
CORINTHIANS PROVE
ROYAL ENTERTAINERS
VAUDEVILLE SHOW DEAWS A
BIG AUDIENCE.
The vaudeville performance Riven by
the Corinthian Yacht Club at Native
Sons" Hall last night was a success and
the jolly yachtsmen demonstrated that
they are royal entertainers. Laughter
was the order of the nlpht and full well
was the order carried out by an audience
that Quite overtaxed the large audi
torium. The hall had been beautifully de
corated for the occasion with a profusion
of club flaps, burgeej and- signal codes,
&nd the effect was decidedly picturesque.
Handsome souvenir programmes were
distributed and contained engravings of
peveral yachts, beside a history of the
club's development by L. IJ. Chapman.
The honors of the evening were easily
with the skit entitled "Looney's Parisian
Ballet," though this does not detract
from the general excellence of the rest
.of the programme, which was replete
with clever numbers. Cathcart as Mrs.
Looney. Ryan as her husband, and Mc
laughlin as Mr. Krautzhammer, threw
tV audience in mild hysterics In their im

played the physical charms of Strauss

MOANING THAT LED TO
MISTAKE IN IDENTITY
JESSIE TOHHEST DID NOT KNOW
ERNEST THOMAS.
Mystery Cleared Up at the Receiving
Hospital by the Appearance
of the Real Party.
E. A. Thomas, who attempted suicide
Jr. Golden Gate Park Wednesday af
ternoon by firing a pistol shot into his
body, still lingers between life and death
Â£t the Receiving Hospital. The mystery
that surrounded his effort has been solved
and the two cases for the hospital physi
ciansâthat of Thomas ar.d that of Jessie
Torrcst of Stocktonâ are entirely separate
erd distinct.
When Jessie Forrest was brought into
the hospital Ehe was suffering from ex
cessive draughts of the sparkling wine
and her mental faculties were somewhat
clouded. Hearing Thomas moaning in the
adjacent ward, ehe Imagined It was the
voice of Ernest Severance, a man from
Stockton, with whom Jessie Forrest had
been associating. By a peculiar coinci
dence Thomas* and Severance's names
tre the same and they bear other com
mon personal marks, although they are
dissimilar in appearance,
t Jessie Forrest received a visit yester
day morning from the real man in the
case. He called upon her and passed an
hour In her company.
According to the statements of Jessie
Forrest, his name is Severance and he
Is a rancher near Stockton. She says he
has followed her around and she may
have to many him In order to be left
undisturbed.
Thomas is a married man, living at
2W Green street with his mother and
Â¦wife and child. He repeatedly told his
mother that then was no hope for him
Jn life, as the "demon drink" had "caught
hold of him with such a tight grip" that
there was "no chance to fight it off "
His wife was with him during the day
fitting by his bedside- and administering
to his wants.
When Severance vMted the hospital
Mrs. Thomas had some conversation with
him and Jessie Forrest, who, upon the
arrival of the right man. immediately dis
claimed any knowledge of Thomas.
GENERAL SAMUEL B. M. YOUNG.
fact that many brilliant achievements un
der the Immediate direction of General
Young were not mentioned in the official
reports of General Otis which were trans
mitted to headquarters in Washington,
D. C.
When Young went to Manila under
proper orders, Otis, of course, had to as
sign the- leader of cavalry to active duty.
When the campaign opened at the close
of the rainy season Young was assigned
to duty In Northwest Luzon. Perhaps
the notion was entertained at headquar
ters in Manila that Young with his bri
gade would disperse the insurgents In his
immediate front and then settle down to
take things quiet until further operations
were ordered. Much to the surprise of
Otis the aggressive Young not only dis
persed the enemy in his front, but pur
sued the flying Filipino* with a visor
that really astonished the natives. The
pursuit was continued as long as the men
and the horses of the brigade were able
to follow the enemy.
Several days after General Young
struck out to assail the insurgents in
their remote strongholds couriers came
back from the brigade to the nearest tele
frraph station with dispatchf-s announc
ng a series of brilliant and successful
engagements. In which the troops cap
tured towns, villages and many prisoners.
In reporting the various operations, Gen
eral Young mentioned the officers of his
command who had particularly distin
guished themselves for skill and success
In the pursuit of the enemy. General
Otis In due time wired to Washington ac
counts of the campaign in Northwest
Luzon -and mentioned the officers whose
achievements were noted In Young's dis
patches, but took especial care to sup
press or omit all reference to Young as
the leader of the expedition.
Stories told by recently returned army
officers and versions of the campaign giv
en in private letters from Manila do not
ascribe to General Otis any hostile motive
In Ignoring the work of General Young.
It Is said that Otis and Young are on
good terms, hut that the latter is not
one of the special favorites at headquar
ters In Manila. In the coterie of favorites
Generals Wheaton, MacArtbur and Bates
are conspicuous. Success in the field
gained by these officers or any one of
them is heralded in the official reports
as military achievements of great Impor
tance. 'W.hcn Young started out for ac
tive work In the field he knew the situa
tion at headquarters and surmised that
he would be restrained if he dlsplaved too
much energy, hence he moved with great
celerity to place himself beyond the reach
of restraining commands. No doubt this
scheme of strategy- baffled Otis and caus
ed him to punish Young by ignoring the
brigade commander In official mention of
the successful engagements.
Alaska. The widow confessed that she
had a nice home In Oakland and $400 In
the bank, and Holt was generous enough
to say that he curpd nothing for her
wealth, as he had plenty for both.
The marriage license was procured Sat
urday and on Sunday they were married
In the Howard Street Methodist Episco
pal Church. They engaged a room in the
Cosmopolitan Hotel and Monday Holt
had a quiet- talk with his bride. He said
that In the spring they would take a trip
to Dawson City and he would sell all
his mines and load her with diamonds.
Meantime he Intended to buy a grocery
and saloon on the southeast corner of
Eighth avenue and he wanted $200 cash
to clinch the bargain. He showed her
what purported to be a check for JlOOO,
and she hurried to Oakland and drew
tho money out of the bank. On her re
turn she handed the money to Holt and
he was "so pleased that he kissed her
three times."
Tuesday morning he told her to go to
Oakland and bring nor furniture and ef
fects to the city and take them to Eighth
avenue. She went to her home and had
all her belongings packed on drays to
bring over to the city, when she received
a message from Holt to wait till the fol
lowing day. as he had not completed ar
rangements. She unloaded the furniture
She came back to the city, but could
find no trace of her husband. She waited
till Wednesday morning, and as he did
not turn up she went out to Eighth ave
nue, but could find no trace of any gro
cery and saloon In the neighborhood
Mrs. Eichorst reluctantly came to the
conclusion that something was wrong
and she called at police headquarters,
where she told her story. Detectives Dil
lon and Crockett were detailed on the
ca.se and they soon decided that Holt
had fled after getting the $200. and that
his tales of wealth were nothing but
dreams. The duped wife may be pre
vailed upon to swear out a warrant for
her husband's arrest, but It Is doubtful,
and even if she did and he wan arrested
she could not testify against him.

ROBERTS' VIEW OF WAR.
SINCE Lord Roberts has become the hope of the
British empire there has been an earncs # t at
tempt to form some sort of an estimate of his
military ideas. His career has been in India, where
his wars have been conducted against badly armed
and undisciplined foes, and hence it has been felt that
no just understanding of his tactical skill could be ob
tained from a study of what he did there. Those who
are trying to forecast his campaign against the Boers
have therefore been forced to seek information from
other sources than that of his past actions, and in
default of any comprehensive expression of his views
on the art of war have made a good deal of certain
speeches of the General upon military topics.
For one thing it is noted that years ago Roberts
had reached the conclusion that improvements in fire
arms have necessitated a radical change in battle
tactics. In an address before the Bengal Rifle Asso
ciation he said: "The more I study the question of
modern fire tactics and the latest inventions in
weapons of war the more I become convinced that
those troops who combine superior individual marks
manship with a sound and thoroughly well mastered
system of fire control and discipline will in future be
the victors whenever armies meet."
From that statement it is clear the field marshal is
not going to underrate the militaYy capabilities of the
Boers, for in no army is there a higher grade of indi
vidual marksmanship than in those the two South Afri
can republics have put intothefield. In other addresses,
however, it is noted that Roberts has laid more stress
upon the importance of discipline and military train
ing. than upon the ability to shoot straight. Thus he
is reported to have said in a speech at the Royal Ar
tillery camp at Secunderabad: "Intelligence must be
brought to bear upon the supervision of fire, and its
conduct must be regulated by method, otherwise, be
lieve me, your individual skill and gallantry, although
these may be as conspicuous as in the past, will,
nevertheless, fail to serve you effectually."
Up to this time the advantage of every battle in
the South African war has been. on the side of the
individual marksman. Safely intrenched amid the
rugged hills of the country, the Boers have been able
by reason of the excellence of their rapid firing and
far-reaching arms to overcome all the disciplined
numbers the British could bring against them. In
fact, their advantage has been so marked that unless
Roberts can devise some strategy sufficient to over
come it, it is plain the Boers will crush every army
Great Britain can send against them and hold their
independence in South Africa as securely as the S>yiss
have held theirs in Europe.
There is a chance that Roberts may yet prove the
correctness of his Secunderabad speech by demon-;
strating that the fire of a disciplined -army supervised
by intelligence can overcome the resistance of undis
ciplined marksmen, no matter how brave they may
be. That chance, however, will depend upon his
ability to draw, or force by maneuvering, the Boers
from their safe strongholds in the hills to fields where,
his disciplined masses can be used effectively. As the
fight has. been going thus) far,' however, the Boers
appear to have the superior intelligence as well as
the ', superior marksmanship oh their, side, and thÂ»
world waits with keen interest to note how the field
marshal . will put his precepts into practice

TO REMOVE MOLESâ Q. E. 8.. City.
The following Is given as a method for
the removal of moles, but as to Its merits
this department does not know anything:
"Croton oil under the form of pomade or
ointment, and potassio tartrate of anti
mony (tartar emetio under the form of
paste or plaster have each been success
fully employed for the removal of ordin
ary moles. The following Is the mode of
using the latter adopted by a French sur
geon: Take tartar emetic in impalpable
powder, 15 grains; soap plaster. 1 dram;
and beat to a paste. Apply the paste to
nearly a line In thickness, not more, ana
cover the whole with strips of gummed
paper. In four or five daya eruption or
suppuration will set in and in a few days
after, leave a very slight scar in place of
the mole. Croton oil ointment effects thor Â¦
same, but less completely unless repeated,
by producing a postular eruption, which,
however, does not permanently mark th&
skin." Persons who desire to get rid of
such blemishes ought to consult a reput
able dermatologist, and not take chance
in using substances with which they are
not familiar.

CO-OPERATION FOR REFORM.
ONE of the most interesting examples of the
success of the co-operation of individuals for
the purpose of municipal reform the record of
recent years affords is reported from Berkeley. In
that university city a number of earnest men and
v.omen undertook to bring about the closing of all
saloons. The question was submitted to the people
and a vote was given in favor of the reform, but the
Town Trustees declined to adopt it because the rev
enues derived from saloon licenses were regarded by
them as necessary to keep the income of the munici
pality equal to the expenditures. Promptly the re
formers went to work to overcome that objection,
and for doing so devised an expedient which is not
only novel and effective but is in the highest degree
commendable.
The town needed the $1800 a year of income from
saloon licenses, and the reformers resolved it should
be forthcoming. It was not their intention to reduce
the town government to parsimonious measures, nor
to run it into debt, nor to impose a heavier burden of
taxation upon their fellow citizens. There was, then,
but one way in which to achieve their object, and that
was by raising the money themselves and assuring the
town against loss. They set about the task with
businesslike sagacity and energy. Two prominent
business men of the town entered into a contract with
the Trustees to guarantee the payment of the $1800
a year if the saloons were closed, and a committee of
men and women undertook to raise the sum by vol
untary contributions. They sent circulars stating the.
facts of the issue to temperance people and
to the parents of the university students
throughout the State, and, it is gratifying to
say, received generous responses. The first
quarterly installment of the sum was paid to the town
on January 10. and it is said there remains a balance
in the hands of the committee for the next payment.
A work of this kind merits a liberal support from
all who are interested in reform movements. The
men and women who are back "of it cannot be charged
with having only an idle interest in the issue, nor can
they be accused of lacking a common sense apprecia
tion of the financial needs of their town. They have
proven their zeal by undertaking to raise the licence
revenues at their own expense, and have accom
plished it in a way that will encourage similar efforts
elsewhere.
Thus far. then, the Berkeley experiment has been
one of marked success, and will be entitled to an hon
orable place in the annals of the community. With
the demonstration of the advantages which temper
ance laws confer upon university towns the whole
population of the place will unite in support of the
' reform. When that time comes there will be a univer
sal willingness on the part of the taxpayers to bear
the cost of maintaining their local administration
without the aid of saloon licenses, and voluntary con
tributions to the town funds will be no longer neces
sary. In the meantime the promoters of the reform
have gone the right way to work to educate their
neighbors on the. subject, without irritating them by
the imposition of increased taxes, and have proven
that in matters of reform as well as in business the
winning system is that of co-operative effort.

IN ISLAM'S TEMPLE
STRANGERS ENTERED
BIG CELEBRATION IN GOLDEN
GATE HALL LAST NIGHT.
Many Who Wished to Learn of Ori

Salt-Covered Sill.
There was a large gathering of illus-
trious nobles of the temple known as Is
lam in Golden Gate Hall Wednesday night
to witness the ceremonies attendant upon
the celebration in memory of Haflz Mo
hammed Shean ed Deen, whose lyric
poems have been praised for purity of
style and excellent harmony, and of the
feast of Eedool-Azra, held in great ven
eration by all good Moslems.
As this is the Shawwal Hegira 1317, the
month in which all orthodox Moslems lay
salt on the doorstlls to keep out the evil
jlnnees, "this custom was observed with
all due solemnity, for there was pertur
bation in the temple when It was an
nounced that a number of strangers had
declared their intention of viewing the
mystic shrlr.e. These to the number' of
forty-three were after certain .exactions
and pledges permitted to pass through*
the outer portals Â©f the temple, where
they were prepared for their journey over
the desert by the lively camel route to
reach the shrine at which they were to
worship. They were introduced into the
mysteries of the order in all the Oriental
splendor which marks the initiatory
work, and they took part in the proces
sion of the Kisweh and of the Mahmeel
and gained knowledge of the Sivain of
Al-Mootazllah. the &irk of the Owlad

EDUCATION IN ART.
PROFESSOR HENRY T. ARDLEY of the
University of California has reprinted from the
"Proceedings of the National Educational As
sociation" his paper on "Art Instruction in the Uni
versity." and has thereby procured for it a wider cir
culation and a more general reading than it would
otherwise have had. The importance and the interest
of the subject justify the republication of the paper,
and should lead all who have authority in educa
tional matters to give it careful attention.
Professor Ardley maintains that whatever differ
ences of opinion may exist as to the kind of art work
best adapted to universities, the course of instruction
should be of an industrial and historical character.
He points out that all the great art epochs of the
world's history were industrial and decorative â not
pictorial â and goes on to say: "Their art was
adapted to use as well as beauty â to purpose, place,
and material, in stone, wood, metal, glass, clay, mo
saics, fabrics, etc. â thus lifting whole nations to a
higher plane of civilization and prosperity. Even
Raphael and Michael Angelo made designs for the
potters and the weavers, the silversmiths and carvers,
and the work of these- artist-artisans is so highly
prized that they are exhibited to-day in our great mu
seums and treasured in the palaces of kings. And the
study of the industrial arts teaches our young people
not to be ashamed of using their hands in producing
something. Is it not too true that to-day many of
our university graduates are educated away from all
industrial art pursuits, rather than to them? And yet
we are sending millions of dollars to Europe every
year to buy almost everything we use in that line,
even though the raw material lies at our very doors
awaiting development through a higher- education of
the hand and mind than the mechanic or the pictorial
artist can give, and our universities should be pre
pared to meet this important demand."
Passing from the consideration of art instruction
in the universities to that in the secondary schools, it
is explained that such instruction should embrace the
careful study of light and shade and linear perspective
in drawing from objects of strong, bold and graceful
outline, not in copying from the flat, where light and
shade and perspective arc ready-made. Of the kind of
art education now given in the schools the professor
says: "Too much of our school drawing is super
ficial, scattered and misleading, and young children
are led to believe that they can -draw, paint and de
sign when they can do no one of these correctly.
They are allowed to play with paint before they can
draw a place to put the paint, and to draw from
imagination before they can draw from the object
imagined. They are supposed to 'design' before they
can invent, and to adapt designs to art periods and
materials of which they know nothing. One pupil
from a high school told me that he could design
s4sined-glass windows, but I, found that he had no
idea of. the kind of glass or 'jewels' kept in stock,
how the window was 'leaded up.' or what 'scale*
should be used in the design; another said she could
make designs for wall-paper and carpets. I was very
much astonished, but upon investigation discovered
that she did not even know the limitations of either
the printing-press or the loom, or how many colors
she could use, or how they were blended in applica
tion."
The subject of art education is one of notable im
portance to California, for the culture of' our people
is sufficiently high to cause a wide demand for artistic
work, and their wealth is sufficient to pay for it;^but
we are lacking as yet in the skill to produce it. Thus
we import thousands of dollars' worth of artistic ob-
It is a dull day in San Francisco when the Market
Street Railway Company cannot be relied upon to
furnish a subject for the Receiving Hospital or th?
Mcrgue. Another collision has maimed and disfig
ured several of the company's patrons for life.
If Colonel Mendell continues to run counter as he
has done in the water inquiry to the ideas of the
Mayor, the aged engineer may find that his removal
is one of those incidents that his Honor considers
"beneficial to the public interest."
NO CHANCE FOR PHELAN.
Alameda Argus.
We may all reasonably conclude that
the political prospects of San Francisco's
Mayor, but yesterday the most promising
of those of any member of his party, have
pretty nearly gone a-glimmering. His ac
tion in removing a Police Commissioner
whom he had but Just appointed and his
whole unfortunate experience In the Chief
of Police matter have stirred up enmity
in his party that will surely disclose it
self whenever he makes effort for further
political honors. It is one of the open
secrets that the Mayor aspires to the ben
ate. He would stand a great chance with
a Democratic Legislature Installed at Sac
ramento and harmony in his party., But
both these conditions were put farther off
by the acrimonious deadlock over the
Chief of Police and the final breaking of
it in the manner that was pursued.
TERRITORY OF HAWAIL
rHE b-ll to erect a Territory of Hawaii is to be
considered not for its specific purpose but as
the first legislation proposing a policy for the
new island possessions of this country.
If it conform to the report which accompanies it, it
is ba:-ed on a fallacy. That report looks forward to
American laboring migration to the islands to take
tnc place 01 .-vsiatic coolie labor. No legislation
ba-ed upon that idea can be a success from the stand
point of the continued prosperity of the island?.
There are now 04,000 coolie laborers in Hawaii.
Their deportation is not provided for in the bill. It
<i<x-s provide, however, for free trade between the
islands and this country. Therelore the employers ot
that cooHe labor arc to enjoy the double benefit of
cheap Asiatic wages and free access to our markets in
competition with the products of high-priced Ameri
can Ãbor.
One of f.vo things must result, in the long run.
Either American wages must fall toward the Asiatic
sc^iic, or American labor must go idle entirely by the
displacement of its product.
There are now only 3000 Americans in Hawaii, in
a population of 130,000. There are some Englishmen.
uho do not expatriate themselves, and a small num
ber of Germans. Practicaiiv the government will be
in the handÂ« of the small American minority, and its
:;::n:bers will be increased only by such as resort
there not to labor, but for business, speculation, in
vestment and to seek official position. When a Ter
ritory iÂ« created statehood becomes possible. Do our
people aish -uch an American State as will be crc
att-d oat ot the>e conditions.'
We believe firmly in the principle that no American
Slste should be attempted where an American labor
jr.g population cannot thrive and receive American
wajtcs. Such a population is the foundation of re
publican government. Because it could not exist in
:'-.t South whiie slavery was there, slavery was abol
jj-fced by a colossal sacrifice of money and life. If
we <>peu the way to tropical communities to become
State-, we .ire admitting that the major premise of
aboi'.f.on was wrong. If an American business popu
lation of 3000 in Hawaii can claim territorial invest
ment and the rij;ht to ultimate statehood, what
ar.su t c?.n we make to the demand of a similar mi
nority, by and by. in the Philippines and Porto Rico?
AÂ« ahatever Congress does will be a precedenr,
Â£re:!t care should be taken in the first step.
Ap:in. it muÂ«t not be forgotten that whatever this
Con^esf does becomes party policy and enters into
the <ti>cuÂ«Mor.s of the approaching campaign. Is it
wise :o take such z step in the dark? The free trade
and libor problems involved are distinctly threaten
ing. Why precipitate them? If Congress had acted
a? to any form of government for Hawaii at the last
scs-.-ion the case would be different. It should not be
fore' tten that the charge iÂ« made that its action then
was ;.ostponcd by the objections of Senator Morgan.
What *ir.i<;tcr party purpose had that sordid partisan
in view by postponement? This is the time in which
trap- are set for the majority party. Its leaders should
be -A.iry. They at least should base no legislation on
the fiHacy of American labor in Hawaii, and should
not r.bandon at this critical time the Republican posi
tion and principle of protection to American labor.

BRAHMS ADMIRABLE;
HOLMES INCOHERENT
<â jrâ l HE programme of the third Sym
jr phony concert of the season, which
j[ took place yesterday afternoon, be
gan with Beethoven's "Coriolan"
overture, intimately characteristic of the
composer. This was followed by Harry
Holmes' "Fraternity" symphony, the
Brahms variations on a theme by Haydn
and Wagner's "Tannhauser" overture.
The variations were by far the most in.
teresting number of the afternoon and,
although read without the color, the in
sight, the purpose they are susceptible
oil they were not altogether robbed of
their intrinsic merit and proved very
agreeable.
The composition is distinguished by ex
quisite workmanship and a skillful man
agement of musical media, such as is pos
sessed and evinced only by genius. An
integrity of tone is preserved through
out, the voices tempering one another in
carrying the song. This is in marked con
trast to a dominatlve intruslveness of the
oboes in the Holmes composition.
I have already said that Mr. Holmes
displayed no great ability as a conductor,
and his reading of the "Tannhauser' over
ture again corroborates the statement. It
was given 'without the Wagnerian spirit
and the orchestra continually promised
a volume that it, never realized except
in the finale, when the brass choir comes
in tutta forza. The tempo was erratic
and was governed entirely by the band
instead of by the conductor, who did no
more than display a deep ignorance of
the score.
The "Fraternity" symphony Is superfi
cial, Incoherent and lacking in melodic in
vention. It has, however, form and tech
nique and in the last movement a sound
tonality that is agreeable.

THE DEBRIS COMMISSION'S REPORT.
BY the report of the Debris Commission encour
agement is given to the expectation that we
shall ere long see something in the way of per
manent work undertaken. to solve the problem of
hydraulic mining and the protection of. our rivers.
The report is conservative in its nature, for it pro
poses to make a thorough test of impounding dams
on the Yuba River before , entering upon similar
works elsewhere, but at the same time it provides for
making that, test in a comprehensive manner and not
in a scant, temporary and unsatisfactory way.
According to the summary of the report that comes
to us from Washington, the project of 1898, which
was founded upon the principle of the construction at
Narrows of a stone dam, is abandoned by the com
mission for the reason that the amount of debris that
could be restrained thereunder would not be com
mensurate -with the expenditure required to obtain
material results. The project of 1899 is the one ap
proved by the commission, chief of engineers and
Secretary of War. It consists of a series of dams
constituting restraining barriers and forming im
pounding reservoirs in and about and above and be
low De Guerre Point, to the extent of 2,000,000 acres
of settling basin, with lateral outlets, and in th
piesent project calculated to impound 50,000,000 cubic
yards of debris. The project likewise touches on the
confining of a portion of the Yuba River to a single
channel so as to avoid to a great'extent the flowing
down the Yuba River of existing debris.
The work outlined is confined to the Yuha River,
and the commission states that when its feasibility
and effectiveness have been demonstrated by the ex
perience of time the impounding of debris in other
localities can be undertaken. It is estimated the work
proposed will cost $800,000. There is now to the
credit of the commission $500,000, of which one-half
was contributed by California. The commission is
in doubt whether it has authority to use Federal
money for the purchase of tracts of land required for
the work, and has asked for authority to do so. Bills
are to be introduced in the Senate by Senator Per
kins and in the House by De Vries empowering the
Secretary of War to make the desired purchases out
of the money now available, for as there is to be no
river and harbor bill at this session it will be impos
sible to obtain the full amount of the sum the work
is estimated to cost until next winter.
It is not likely there will be much if any opposi
tion to the recommendations of the commission. We
are therefore in sight at last of the beginning of per
manent works in the solution of this problem so im
portant to the State. Thus there is another bright
prospect prosperity before us, for there can be no
doubt that the settlement of the debris question will
prove immensely beneficial to the mining counties
and the valleys, and indirectly to the welfare of all.
Already rumors have been put into circulation that
Lieutenant Esola, alias Harrington, is a candidate for
the 'office of captain of police. The same reasons
that prevented his election as Chief of Police appeal
with as much force against his selection as captain.

or not, he has at least' rendered service of a high value

The Plate.
There are a, number of different makes
of dry plates on the market, any of which
with proper handling wtll Tleld good re
sults, and the best course for a beginner
is to select one brand and stick to It until
the working of it is thoroughly under-
S MoÂ«"t plates are made la three grades
of speed, usually termed slow, medium
and fast or Instantaneous. The beginner
should chose the slow or medium speed
plate for his first work, which la nearly
always an outdoor picture, as the medium
plates admit of considerably more latitude
In exposure than the fast plate and are
besides easier to develop, or to control la
development- â .
The great percentage of failures at tnÂ»
commencement of the amateur photog
rapher's career is due to overexposue.
With the fast plate overexposure of a few
seconds only is fatal (without the experi
ence of a veteran to control it), while wita
the slow plate It Is not nearly so serious
a matter. The beginner will find that he
will waste plates enough In bis early ef
forts with the medium plate, without
squaring the number by the usa of fast
ones.

COURSE IN PHOTOGRAPHY FOR AMATEURS.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton-
PHOTOGRAPHY FOR AAIATEURS.
Iâ INTRODUCTORY STUDY.
BY GEORGE W. GILSON.
It Is hardly necessary at this date, to
begin a series of articles of practical In-
struction to the amateur photographer
with the detailed history of the birth and
wonderful growth of this science. "We
shall, therefore, give but a brief history
of photography before proceeding to the
more instructive chapters.
The actual discovery of the darkening
or coloring effect of the sun's rays on
different substances was made 100
years ago, but the discovery of photog
raphy as we think of it and know It to
day Is said to have been made by Da
guerre In August of 1?39. He then gave
usâ or, rather, the French Government,
which afterward gave it to the worldâ
the process by which a direct picture
could be taken by photography. This pro
cess was called the daguerreotyping pro
cess and is the old daguerreotype with
which most of us are familiar. While
the daguerreotype was a portrait or pic
ture by photography, and very beautiful
of its kind, still the process differed
greatly from that now in use. The re
sult was a positive, in place of a nega
tive, the picture being made direct on a
copper plate. Each picture was an orig
inal. If a person required six pictures six
sittings were necessary, and the time of
exposure differed from thirty to forty
minutes. With our rapid dry plates of
the present day, coated with their sen
sitive salts, the exposure Is but a frac
tion of a moment. To Daguerre alone
suit of nature at her best, and often un
consciously this means the development of
the artistic and better side of ones na
tu L^ p the bringing out of our generous,
nobler and higher qualities.
It needs but ore glance at the corarrer
cial side of the question to realize of wlut
immense importance photography la as &
factor of the world's commerce. Millions
of dollars are nnw Invested in mannfao
turing for the wants of camera user*,
giving employment to thousands of wat;e
earners. *I"he fact that a combination of
one branch only of this Industry was late
ly capitalized at $r>.OOÂ»).t>Â» is suggestive of
Its magnitude, and Its growth is all thÂ©
more wonderful when It is considered that
It is practically a young enterprise. Only
a few years ago a traveler, en tour, cam
era In hand, attracted attention. Now thÂ©
camera Is considered an Indispensable ad
dition to the well-regulated tourist's kit.
This series of articles is intended anÂ«i
written for the instruction of the begin
ner, and will necessarily be extremely ele
mentary at first, as It la supposed tr*at
students who start with us in this sriea
are only now considering the taking up of
photography and consequently have little
or no knowledge of Its mysteries. It ttUI
be our aim to dispel the seeming mystery
of using the sun as a pencil to draw beau
tiful pictures of nature and to teach prac
tically and step by step the necessary
knowledge for making pictures by pf.o
tography. Before an artist can paint bis
picture he must first have and thoroughly
understand the use of his brushes, colors,
canvas, etc.. and likewise before we make
photographs we must first have the neces
sary articles or tools with which tr> work.
Hence it is necessary and appropriate
that we first select the camera, the lens
and the plate upon which our picture is
to be.
And for our future success in picture
making we must thoroughly understar.-i
why our tools are necessary, -what part
each play 3 in the making of our picture,
and we must learn to handle them as In
telligently as the painter handles his
brush and colors or the sculptor his chisel
and mallet.
The Camera.
Of different styles of cameras there !a
no end. but for the present purpose they
may be divided Into two kinds, the har.a
camera and the stand or tripod camera.
A beginner us-ually has the sarnewhat
mistaken idea tbat the hand camera is thÂ«
easier to handle, and in a way It is. but
it is not the easier for a beginner to make
good pictures with, and we are therefore
going to recommend our class to begin
with the tripod camera of a style that will
admit of focusing and of a size. say. for
pictures four irchfa by five inches, com
monly called in photographic parlance a
"four by five." The hand camera is a vc-y
po*pu!ar and extremely useful camera, anl
will be fully taken up later in this s?riÂ»3.
It Is not at all the object of these articles
to recommend the goods of any one manu
facturer over another, therefore the make
of camera to be selected will be left to
the student, with the advice to purchase
one of the standard rnake3 having a good
rectilinear lenÂ«. a shutter and a fairly
long-drawn bellows. It should also be or
the front focusing style, as focusing by
means of moving the front board (to
which the lens is fastened) is much nar.d
ier than by moving the back.
The front board spoken of above siiottM
be what is termed a sliding front, and tha
camera should also have a swing bari,
and the back should he reversible. Those
terms will be fully explained as they cotaa
up in future chapters.
One plate holder (holding two plates)
comes with each camera, and it wll! be
best to get two extra holder?, so that four
or six plates may be ready for use at
once. A pneumatic release shutter capa
ble of fast or flow exposures and of time
exposures should be a permanent part of
the lens. The tripod should be sufficiently
strong to be perfectly ritfid when In posi
tion and holding the camera. Some ara
made so as to fold into very small com
pass. Do not get one in which strength is

On motion of counsel for the plaintiff

Pleasant Entertainment in Honor of

Anniversary.
The eightieth anniversary of the birth
day of Miss Susan B. Anthony was fitting

bears the noble lady's name. Century

celebration and was filled with not onl>

liminary steps were taken to restore, or
rather remodel, the chancel of Lacock
Church, Wiltshire, with which Fox Tal

years, but latterly a local committee has
taken the matter In hand and a portion of
the requisite sum has been ral!Â«ed. White
the suitability of the suggested memorial
may prove productive of discussion. It
should be recollected that the Idea Is one
which would have been acceptable to Vox
Talbot himself, and photographers would
be honoring their craft If they provided
the funds for this or any other suitable
memorial In the centenary year of the
man who may most truly be called "the
father of photography."
There Is no fact or hobby, call It what
you will, that is at once so attractive and
instructive and that gives such lasting
f>leasure as does photography. It carries
19 followers afield, and while giving phys
ical exercise and mental pleasure ft gives
instruction of the best kind and it Induces
artistic conception and brings to the front

A FORTUNATE BEGINNING.
The client In Portland, Oregon, who sent one
quarter, or $1 ticket No. 18.353. winning '2500 00,
for collection to one of the leading banks In
Pan Francisco, made a very good beginning for
the new year. The ticket of the January 25,
1500, drawing of the Lottery of- the Beneflcencia
Fubllca Company, City of Mexico, was pre
sented by the bank's messenger, Mr. John
Piper, who received the money for same.
The previous record of this company Is an
open book, and the prompt payment of prizes
Is acknowledged by all. The great popularity
of the Lottery of the Beneficencla Publlca Com

the "fact that many of .the capital prizes have
been won here and were promptly paid.

JOSEPH NIEPCE.
is not due all the credit for the discov
ery of photography, for another French
man, by name Joseph Nicephore
Niepce. experimenting at the same time
as Daguerre. discovered many Interest-
Ing details that added to Daguerre's dis
covery very materially in the perfecting
of the process. Again, there are many
who stanchly claim that Fox Talbot was
the true originator of photography, and
consider that to him should be accorded
the title of the "father of photography."
a mantle so long worn by Daguerre.
Apropos of this Is the article lately pub
lished in an English journal, which speaks
of Talbot's claims as follows:
On February 11. 1500. exactly one hundred
years will have elapsed since the birth ot
William Henry Fox Talbot- To many pho
tographers h!s name la possibly unfamiliar:
by many more his contributions are, without
doubt, vaguely apprehended. No permawnt
recognition of them exista. and even the liter
ature of the craft of which he was the virtual
founder often misrepresents and underrates his
labor. The centenary of his btrth comes, there
fore, as a ttttlrs occasion on which to direct
the attention of the photographic world to the
part which Fox Talbot played In the evolution
of photography, ar.d his relations to his con
temporaries in these pregnant years of tne
third and fourth decades of this century.
The Inventors of the art science were
treading pretty closely en one another a
heels, but those who have studied the
early history of photography will acqui
esce in the opinion that even so far as
priority of publication is concerned Fox
Talbot is entitled to the premier place
among the fathers of photography. But
this is not his most Indisputable claim.
Talbot's process contained the possibilities
of indefinite modification. The multipli
cation of positive proofs from a negative
originated with him and has proved the
only practicable principle In photography
eveV 3ince.
For his share, too, in the development of
the sister art of photo-engraving Fox Tal
bot likewise deserves a full measure of
credit. He was one of the earliest pio
neers In that afterward fruitful field of
discover}- â the production of printing sur
faces by photographic means. He was
one of the first experimenters with bichro
mated gelatin and perfected and also
patented a process for the reproduction
of an intaglio plate to which he gave the
name '"photoglyphlc engraving."
This brief outline will serve to call to
mind the position of Fox Talbot in pho
tographic history, a position hitherto
scarcely recognized. In France a statue
of Joseph Nicephore Niepce stands In the
town of Chalons-sur-Saone. and the res
toration of the church of his native Bry
nur-Jlarr.e has been carried out as one
memorial to Daguerre. The only proposal
to perpetuate in any way the memory of
Henry Fox Talbot has curiously enough
taken the same form as that last men-
Ing the strictest kind of quarantine and
no one is allowed alongside the Coptic.
The steamer Caroline, that generally
transfers the steerage passengers and
their baggage from the Oriental steam
ers to the quarantine steamer, broke
down while she was in the Carquinez
Straits. Luckily there was nothing for
her to do and Captain Leale was able
to repair damages before his ship was
required.
Steward Eddy on the American ship
Shenandoah had a peculiar experience
last Monday night. Just as he was about
to retire two women closely veiled came
to him and asked that he scatter the
contents of an urn from the masthead of
the ship. Eddy consented to do the job
and going aloft scattered the ashes to
the four points of the compass. \ The wo
men below wept in concert while the
ceremony was being performed, and when
Eddy came back with the empty urn one
of them seized it and threw It into the
bay. The ashes were the remains of
Walter J. Blanchard, who died in Ala
meda on the Sth Inst.
Steward Eddy says the women came
from Alameda. One of them lost her hus
band last Thursday week and his dying
request was that he be cremated and his
ashes scattered to the four winds from
the truck of the largest American ship
afloat. The wishes of the dead man were
carried out. and all that remains to the
widow is a memory.
The steamer Robert Dollar is now on
her way to San Francisco with the larg
est cargo of lumber that has ever come
out of Grays Harbor in one bottom. Hith
erto 600.000 feet of lumber was considered
a big load for a vessel to take across
the bar, but the Dollar has crossed out
in safety with 1,00.",000 feet, much to the
surprise and delight of lumber men in
general.
George Smith, sailmaker on the British
ship' Barbermere. had a narrow escape
from death yesterday. He had a quarrel
with Charles White, the ship's cook, ard
the latter struck him over the let*, eye
with a cleaver. The wound, while serious,
was not dangerous, and after Dr. Arms-t
ed had dressed it at the Harbor Hospital
Smith was able to go back to his ship.
The transport Sherman will sail for
Manila Saturday at noon. Some of the
cleverest work ever seen on the front has
been done in the getting of this transport
ready for sea. Captain Bennett of .'he
stevedoring firm of Bennett & Goodall put
IC-00 tons of coal Into her In sixteen hours,
while from 1 p. m. Wednesday until iuon
of yesterday the transport force, under
Captain Dunn, put 2000 tons of freight
aboard. The coaling feat is one of tnÂ»
best efforts ever made on this coast, as all
the fuel had to be hoisted aboard from
lighters. Captain Bennett remained at his
post personally superintending the job un
til 6 a. m. yesterday, and only went home
to change his clothes after th^Sherman
was coaled and ready for sea. It wa.s a
clever piece of stevedoring and Captain
Bennett deserves all the credit he received
from the officers of the transport service.
The Sherman will take away about f>O<iO
tons of freight. 400 casuals and sev-.-ral
officers.
ROW AT OLYMPIA
THEATER ENDS
IN BROKEN RIBS
Marie Wood and Max
Haas Principals.
Marie D. Wood, billed ns the "Califor
nia Nightingale" at the Olympia Theater,
did not appear on the stage of that play
house last night. An altercation with the
assistant manager. Max Haas, a pair of
broken ribs and internal injuries received
on Wednesday evening put out of the
question any participation in the Olympia
programme by Miss Wood.
There can be no doubt that Marie D.
Wood, who was formerly a Miss Dohr
mann of Stockton, Is suffering intensely
from some bodily Injury. When seen last
night at her rooms, 223 Powell street, she
told the following story:
"I was leaving the rooms at the back
of the stage when Mr. Haas came up to
me and we had words over something
that had just happened. He caught me
by the arms, pressed me against tne wall
and aftt-r that I can't remember anything
that happened. How I dragged myself
home I can't say, for I was in fearful
pain and suffering intensely."
Miss Wooo's sifter was attending her
last night, and she was outspoken in de
claring that the singer had oeen violently
handled Uy Max Haas. She also insinuat
ed that some action would be brougnt
against him. Dr. Rosecrantz was caned
in yesterday morning and visited the pa
tient repeatedly during the day.
Haas* story does not tally with that of
XJiss Wood. He says that the "California
Nightingale" was using obscene language
renecting upon the visitors of the nouse.
To stop her diatribe short he went back
of the stage. Seeing him approach she at
tempted to strike him and he then pirr
ioned her arms to her sides. Haas saya
she left the Olympia perfectly sound and
w<*ll and in no way disabled or injured
by anything which he had done.

engines and boilers of the vessel, but
when court opened in the morning It was
announced that he would not be allowed
to give evidence before the naval court,
and if the court wanted what testimony
he could give it could call for the report
made by Inspector Bulger and now on file
in the Custom-house.
Until the court stopped him McDonald's
testimony was devoted to his experience
as an engineer. He told how he had
served on various vessels, among them
the Olympla and* the Oregon during their
trial trips, and also how he had served
as chiel engineer of the Panama. When
he got that far the court announced that
so tar as it was concerned the fact that
he was chief engineer of the Panama was
sufficient for the purposes of the court
and there was no need of any further
testimony. Then the witness turned to
the events of the voyage to and from Ma
nila.
McDonald was particularly emphatic in
declaring that he had never been drunk
either going or coming en the trip. He
also said he had not been drunk at Yoko
hama or at any other place. He said, too,
that he had never ordered a drop of liquor
from the shore during the whole voyage.
The court is already in possession of what
his bill at the ship's bar v.'as, and there
fore it can judge of what the engineer
drank, taking his bill as a basis.
A good part of the day was devoted to
a description of the methods of clearing
the bilges of the vessel and .why it was
that they were allowed to go "so long in a
foul condition. The vessel was very deep
in her bilges, the engineer said, and so a
very little water would make a big show
ing so far as the soundings were con
cerned. He said. too. that duringMhe trip
out and in there were no soundings post
ed en the sounding board, and for a good
part of the time the distance the ship had
run was not reported to the engineer.
The engineer had no great liking for
Filipinos as men to work on a vessel, for
he said the best men he could get in
Manila were not competent and would not
and could not work in the fireroom. He
referred to the men he hired to help clean
out the bilges. Referring to the ton and
a half of dirt the chief officer had said
he saw taken from the bilges, the chief
engineer said It was no more than should
be expected from such a vessel. The fire
room plates were warped and the ashes
were constantly sifting down into the
bilges. Why he did not clean the bilges
anyway he did not say, except to reiter
ate that the engine-room force kept good
care of the bilge under the tireroom and
whenever the men could they tried to
clean the bilges under the boilers. It was
under the boilers that all the dirt was
found. The coal got through the warped
flreroom plates, he said, when it was be
ing shoveled from the forward bunkers
into the flreroom plates.
Regarding the water reported in the
ship's hold, the engineer said the depth
was much increased by the unsteadiness
of the vessel. She was light anyway, he
said, and whenever the sea picked up she
rolled badly. When they were coming
back he Bald the afterhold was filled with
coal, and when they^rot off Honolulu it
was decided that to remove the coal from
the afterhold would leave the vessel in
bad trim, so it was decided to put into
Honolulu and fill the' bunkers without dis
turbing the coal in the afterhold. This
was why, he said, the ship put Into Ho
nolulu. In concluding, the chief engineer
said that he had never had any talk with
the captain or any one else as to the
number of days required to reach San
Francisco, or the amount of coal that
would be needed.
The report of Inspector Bulger will
probably be read to-day.

Xczv York Stock Market.
NKTV YORK. Feb. 15.â The movement of
â¢prices in the Hock market to-day reflected
very clearly the doubtful and conflicting specu
lative oj'lr.lon over the outlook for prices. The
opinion reflected was almost wholly that of
â¢profcj-sMrnal c;ifratcrÂ» In stocks, as they were
the only one* who took any notabl* part In
the trading. The general public persisted in
keeping out of the stock market and this con
tinued indlS>r*-nce had not a little to do with
doubts of the itrofeÂ«=*lonal speculators, some of
â¢nhoni fold stocks before the close of the day,
Â¦prompted by their disappointment over the
failure of any general demand for stacks to
develop. A number of factors contributed to
en early advarro In prices. The initial lm
j ; Â» â¢ camÂ» from the l>indon market, where
prices advanced m the cheerful feeling en
gendered by the forward movement of British
troops in SSouth Africa. London was a buyer
here at the opening, but the demand from
that source was satisfied with the taking of
25.G00 to SO.OOo shares. The Iron and steel
FToup advanced In company In the morning
and the active bidding up of professional
traders. American Steel and Wire rising to
vithin a fraction rÂ»f 60. Tennessee Coal roÂ«e
an extreme *ji^. The impulre to thnae stocks
came from the allegations contained In a pend
ing lawsuit of notoriety regarding the enor
mous profits of the steel trade for the past
year and Â«r-sÂ»rti<->n* of the likelihood of still
larcer returns fur the current year. The
Â«-tnÂ»ngth in Hufiar was based upon rather vague
rumom of a coming advance in the price of
the product and renumjitlon of operations by
rvflnerlÂ»Â»s recently clewed down. But the
rtrenfrth from these causes was not well main
tained In far* of the apathy of the demand
and the notable weakness In *on:e special
rtnoki. A break of (% In Third Avenue was
due to the announcement by a banking house
of Its withdrawal of a projK>Â«ed loan to this
company. This oauÂ»M tharp sympathetic de
clines In the other Incal traction stocks, the
|nÂ» nntl *teÂ«>l stocks and Supar and In fact
unsettled t!:Â«Â» whole list. Railway stocks lost
the enrly gains and became dull but notably
firm near la*t night's level of prices. Reports
continue to reflect a high level of prosperous
buslnetw activity and an unprecedented level
of railroad earni'igs. Bat this very activity
In r>u*'nÂ«*BÂ» arouses a question whether the
cc > i~of*j*e rou s vim* of Tnoney thus Involved is not
likely to deplete the supply of funds available
Tor ppcrulfitlve purposes. No better explana
tion has l>een found of last week's enormous
loan fxpanMon than the demand for mercantile
tin"*, which is known to be on a very large
vcaie. RatÂ»^t for call loans still continue easy.
Thut only the choicest rmdeÂ« of mercantile

â¢CHICAGO. Feb. 15.â Corn was the governing
market on the exchange to-day. Corn started
rather easy. May opening at 34%Â®34%0 to 34? i&
!4*jc, and selling off early to 34% c. The mar
ket quickly found Itself crowded with buyers,
and the desire to get corn, actuated by small
country offerings and the large cash business
done yesterday, and the promise of heavy ship
ping business to-day, caused a rally. Trade was
active and the market broad. May soared to
354 c and clesed %c up at 35">i@35Â»ic, having
receded from the top on profit-taking.
WHEATâ With snow on the ground and the
Northwest receipts 150 cars larger than last
year's and 200 cars over last week's, holders set
less value on their May wheat at the opening,
which was at CS^feSTic, compared with yester
day's close at es"Â»c. Before support was re
ceived May reacted to 68Hc, caused by the
strength of corn, better late cables, reports of
more damage to the long suffering French crop
an Improved export demand and better late
cables. May worked Its -way up to 694J?69'4c
and cloeed firm. He over yesterday, at 69c
Trade was active the greater part of the ses
sion. There was considerable profit-taking and
pome heavy covering by shorte, principally St.
Louis people.
OATSâ The greater part of the Bession In oats
lagged, but toward the end took a brace in
sympathy with the strength of corn. May
closed %c up at 24c.
PROVISIONSâ There- was a dip In provisions
early, but the market recovered on the strength
of corn and a firmer tone In hogs. Trade was
fairly active. May pork closed 124(g15c over
yesterday. May lard 24c up and May ribs 5(2
74c higher. *

j after several attempts rolled to the right
j thickness to be applied to the face.
Exposures at first were made . three
j times on every other day and for fifteen
> minutes each time. These exposures were
; varied in accordance with the progress
j made in killing the growth.
No pain was felt, according to Dr. Self
ridge, but the effect of the ray waa Buch
as to produce a peculiar sensation, hard
to express In words. The spreading of the
cancer stopped after the first exposure
and in a ehort time new tissue began to
form, the edgres of the wound made by
Incisions of the scalpel becoming clean
and smooth. All traces of the cancer have
now disappeared, but the skin and tissue
In the region of the cancer axe delicate
and sensitive and the exposures are being
continued.
Dr. Selfridgre. with true medical caution,
declares that he is not willing to claim
a complete cure until this sensitiveness

"I will not assert a cure until all pos
sibility of relapse is past." said Dr. Self
ridge, "but there is every Indication that
the progress of the cancerous growth has
been arrested and its virulent principle
destroyed, while the -wound Is almost
healed. Pain has entirely ceased and I
now enjoy a sleep at night that I have
been a stranger to for years."
Dr. Selfridge's brother medicos, without
regard to the school of medicine of which
they may be disciples, regard the cure
as an accomplished fact. The news has

MRS. DICKA COOL
WARD PETITIONS
FOR A DIVORCE
Sequel to Sensational
Elopement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb.' 15.
Mrs. Dicka Cool Ward Is trying to se
cure a separation from Alan H. Ward of
Alameda and another romance of a se
cret marriage has been wrecked on the
rocks of the divorce court.
The wedding of Alan H. Ward and Miss
Dicka Cool startled the social circles of*
Oakland and Alarneda last Thanksgiving.
Miss Cool is the daughter of Russell H.
Cool, one of the begt known club men
and dentists in Osh".and and San Fran
cisco. She Is a beantv and waa one of
the belles of the younger set In Oakland.
Alan H. Ward is one of the swagger
young men of Alameda and the son of a
wealthy mining engineer.
Last Thanksgiving Alan Ward and Miss
Dicka Cool surprised everybody by slip
ping quietly over to San Rafael, where
they were made husband and wife in due'
form. But love was not to last long-.
Immediately after the ceremony they
separated, returning to their own homes,
and they ha'ye only seen each other a
very few times since the marriage.
A few days ago Mrs. Ward filed her
suit for a divorce and to-day Ward re
plied. The wife's complaint alleges
faithlessness on the part of her husband
and the latter's answer Is a general de
nial.
MRS. DARNEAL
SHOWS SIGNS
OF RELENTING
Â»
Daughter's Marriage
Postponed.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 15.â The wedding o!
Alan Bowen and Miss Susie Darneal, the
announcement of whose engagement cre
ated such a furor in Alameda society last
week, will not take place on the 19th lust.
as planned. Mr. Bowen is authority for
the statement that it has been postponed
until the 10th of March to please Mrs.
Darneal, though the parental objections
to the match have not by any means been
removed.
The Bowen-Darneal engagement has
been the subject of much talk in society,
particularly on account of the opposition
of Mrs. Darneal to Mr. Bowen. The
mother thought her daughter should look
much higher, and was emphatic in her as
sertions that she should never marry him
with her consent. She had nothing espe
cial against the young man except that
she thought him rather gay and not alto
gether impressed with the responsibilities
of married life. The fact that youn?
Bowen is a member of the wholesale firm
of Wetmore, Bowen & Co. and tha' it
deals in wines was also held against him.
But the objections of her mother diJ not
.â¢hake the determination of Miss Darneal
to wed the man she had selected &â¢$ her
ideal. All arguments fell upon deaf car*.
The j-oung couple decided that they would
be married on the 19th of February, and
that unless opposition was removed the
vows would be exchanged at the Bowen
family residence, corner of Union street
and Clinton avenue.
Now Mrs. Darneal has relented some
what in her hostility to the match, fc'he
has become Impressed with the futility of
further objections and has agreed to as
sist her daughter in the preparation of her
trousseau. More than that she will not
do. The wedding will not be performed at
the bride's residence. Mrs. Darneal may
even refuse to attend when It takes place,
at the Unitarian Church on March 10, at
11 o'clock. Where the reception will be
held is a question.
COAST CUTTLE
MEN TO MEET
IN THIS CITY
Move to Have Grazing
Land Leased.
A meeting of the cattle men of Califor
nia, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Utah,
Nevada and Arizona will be held in this
city on March 5 for the purpose of taking
steps to secure the passage of the Foster
bill now pending before Congress. -This
bill provides for the delimitation and leas
ing of the grazing lands on the public do
main to stockmen for terms of ten years,
with the right of renewals, thus giving
the cattlemen the control of his range
for a number of years. A circular letter
of invitation will to-day be sent to all
stockmen in the territory indicated.
Among other things the circular says:
"Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Agricul
ture, has personally visited and Inspected
the grazing regions west of the ninety
ninth meridian and has noted the rapid
exhaustion of their forage, due to the lack
of lawful. protection thereof, and to their
being commons. Tho Secretary foresees
the approaching end of the grazing busi
ness and a vital blow at the country's
beef supply unless the ranges are put un
der such possession and control as will
give stockmen an interest In the renewal
of their grasses by making a profit there
in. The biil is favored by both the Secre
tary of Agriculture and the Secretary of
the Interior."
It is expected, so the circular says, that
in ten years the ranges may be restored to
their original primitive condition of pro
ductiveness in forage and that the" beef
food supply will then keep pace with the
Increase In population, and the Govern
ment will have in the restored ranges a
very valuable property. To effect this the
Agricultural Department has secured the
Introduction of a bill by Senator Foster of
Washington. The substance of the original
bill has already been published in The
Call, but since then two amendments have
been offered. One excepts lrrigrable home
steads and mineral lands and the other
provides as follows:
"And there shall be a preferential policy
in leasing toward the actual owners of
stnek occupying the ranges."
The bill as it now stands Is printed in
the circular letter, which declares that
"This meeting will be for the purpose of
'organizing to aid the Agriculture and In
terior departments in securing the pass
age of the above bill, to the end that law
ful possession, under a leasehold, of the
stock rar.pes may replace the lawless oc
cupancy which has not only rapidly ex
ha,usted the forage, but has invested graz
ing with risk and uncertainty that should
not shadow a business that is expected
not only to furnish the domestic tK>ef food
supply, but al^o a very important surplus
for export. But the departments must
have your help and cannot do without it."
The letter or invitation was written and
eigr.ed by Colonel John P. Irish.

Married in the Auditor's Office.
The ceaseless monotony of the Auditor's
office was relieved yesterday by a mar
riage ceremony, In which Daniel Smith of
MERELY THE RESULT OF
A LITTLE CONVIVIALITY
Wife of a Grants Pass Mining Man
Whose Actions Are Causing
Comment.
The story which was circulated yester
day morning concerning the robbery of
Mrs. J. R. Harvey of Chicago, a guest at
the Palace Hotel, proves on Investigation
to have been a literal pipe dream. Mrs.
Harvey arrived at the hostelry Wednes
day with her ten-year-old son and regis
tered from Chicago. Mrs. Harvey does
not come from that city. She Is the wife
of J. R. Harvey of Grants Pasa, Or., and
has evidently come to this city to escape
from trouble, domestic or otherwise, and
gave her address as Chicago for the pur
pose of escaping identification.
Upon her arrival It was noticed that
she acted as though under the influence
of some drug and her behavior was such
as to cause those with whom she cams
in contact to Imagine she was suffering
from the effects of a prolonged debauch.
In the evening she attended the perform
ance at the Columbia. Where she went
after the theater closed is not known,
but late in the night Bhe was observed
wandering about Market street as though
half stupefied. J. Oppenhelmer, a local
advertising agent, noticing her condition,
approached her and ascertaining that she
lived at the Palace called a cab and took
her there.
On alighting from the cab Oppenhelmer
felt something drop into his pocket. He
took no notice or It at the time, but
after he had seen his charge placed In
the proper hands he investigated and
found a -diamond ring with about fifteen
stones set in a cluster in his pocket. At
the same time he discovered that his own
scarf pin was missing.
Yesterday morning Oppenhelmer called
on Mrs. Harvey and returned her ring,
asking her at the same time if she knew
what had become of his pin. She said
that it must have dropped out of his
scarf when he was helping her the night
before and she gave him an order for $29
to comfort him for his loss. Oppenheimer
cashed the order at the hotel office and
went his way rejoicing.
When an attempt was made yesterday
to interview Mrs. Harvey word was sent
down that she could not be seen as she
was upset and under the care of a phy
sician. From other sources, however, it
was learned that the woman Is addicted
both to the use of liquor and drugs and
that her present Indisposition is me re
sult of a too liberal Indulgence in absinthe
or some other like liquor.
If the gossip that is floating round is to
be believed Mrs. Harvey's actions at the
Columlffa were unconventional to the
verge of eccentricity. It Is said that she
occupied a box at the performance, and
her actions there were $>uiflclently out of
the commonplace to distract the atten
tion of the audience from the stage. The
climax was reached, so say . these same
gossips, when the bibulous lady attempted
to climb out of the box on to the stage
bo that her ability as an entertainer
should have wider scope.
Patrick Connell Had Heart Disease.
Morgue Surgeon Leland testified before
the Coroner's Jury yesterday that the
autopsy on the body of Patrick Connell,
who was found drowned last Monday
morning in a lime barrel, revealed the
fact that the heart of the dead man had
become enlarged to nearly four times its
normal size by disease, and that he was
likely to have fallen dead at any mo
ment.
It is supoosed that, feeling a fainting
fit coming on, the deceased sat on the
edge of the barrel, and becoming un
conscious fell into it and was drowned.
The Jury rendered a verdict of death by
asphyxiation. ' '
Swindled Her Lover.
Mrs. Martha Browhard. who Is accuser!
of swindling James Leeper out of lid)
on the Dromlse that she would marry
him. was instructed and arraigned in.
Judge Conlan's court yesterday on tho
charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses.
At the request of her attorney the case
was continued for a week, as a number
of witnesses had to be brought from Am
ador County. Another man was in court
who said Mrs. Browhard had in the same
way swindled him out of $1000, but he re
fused to give hi 3 name or swear out a
warrant for her arrest.
Franklin's Squaw Compromises.
The contest of the will of the late Julius

*jp^ FTER suffering from career cf the
' '\ face for twenty-five years Dr. J.
JJ M. Selfridpe. the founder of Fab
ioia Hospital, has been almost com
pletely cured by the X-ray. This first
epecific instance in which the malignant
growth that has long b*en the bane of
the radical profession has been arrested
without the use of the scalpel will not
only lift a heavy load off the mind of
the afflicted physician and be a cause of
rejoicing among his numerous friends,
but wi!l be of Immense Interest to the
ecirntiSc world.
The origin of Dr. Self ridge's cancer was
cenoted by a snia!l pimple the sire of a
;ea. which appeared at the base of the
r.osÂ«. It was operated upon three times,
bat the root of the growth was not
reached in any of the operations and be
fore the wound had healed the cancer had
.-rain made ltÂ« appearance. It finally ate
IXI way into the face and the lower part
cf the noÃe was destroyed.
la last October Dr. S^lfridg-e began Â«
rcrimer.tlKg with the X-ray in conjunc
tion with his son. Dr. C. M. Selfrldge.
and Dr. N\ H. Chamberlain. They knew
that the ray produced by the Crookes
tube caused a wound up<,n the healthy
dt-rmls. or true skin, which healed very
Â¦lowly. ar.<3 that It wou.u change the
color and destroy the growth of hair. In
'Â¦r<2Â«-r to prevent injury to the face they
used a lead mask, as this metal is the
\(&st responsive to the influence of the
ray of any known substance. The pure

Secretary Moran of the Civil Service
Commission is In receipt of two commu
nications from John R. Proctor, presi
dent of the United States 'Civil Service
Commission, and Chief Examiner A. R.
Serven, covering various points relative
to civil service examinations. In his let
ter Mr. Proctor states that the best
method of determining the relative effi
ciency of employes is still an unsolved
problem, and he gives as the opinion of
the commission with which he is con
nected that, other things being equal,
seniority or JenÃth of service should gov
ern in promotions. Mr. Serven urges that
the examinations be made of such a char
acter as to receive the indorsement of
practical business men.

GIVES UP
CONTROL OF
WHEEL RACES
League of American Wheelmen
Also Abolishes Amateur
Membership Clause.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 15,-The Na
tional Assembly of the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen to-day reflnaulshed con
trol of racing and abolished the amateur
clause of membership. All other refer
ences to amateur wheelmen were stricken
from the constitution. The amendments
bringing about this sweeping change in
the conduct of the league were offered' by
I. B. Potter, and were adopted amid the
cheers of the delegates. These questions
and that of the establishment of good
roads occupied the attention of the dele
gates until a late hour this afternoon-
There were but four votes against the
abolition of the racing ' and amateur
clauses.
At the afternoon session the following
officers were elected: President, Conway
W. Sams, Maryland; first vice president.
Robert T. Klngsbury, New Hampshire:
second vice* president, A. B. Choate. Min
nesota; treasurer, James C. Tattersall.
New Jersey; auditing committeeâ Clarence
W. Small, Maine; Aaron Wolfson, Massa
chusetts: T. M. Skyles, Maryland.
A resolution was offered by H. B. Holl
berton of New York that the* matter of
future publication of the L. A. W. Bul
letin be referred to the executive comlt
tee with Instructions to report at the pres
ent meeting if possible. The good roads
question was brought forward by' a
lengthy resolution, which aroused consid
erable discussion relative to its constitu
tionality. ThÂ© following substitute was
adopted: â¢
"That the movement to secure action by
Congress relative to national road Im
provement be heartily approved and that
a committee consisting of I. B. Potter,
A. Willson. A. B. Choate and F. P. Van
\\ alkenburg be appointed to consider the
proposed legislation."
A resolution was adopted recommend
ing thÂ© passage of the bill now in Con
gress making larger appropriations for
the Lnited States office of road inquiry,
and recommending Otto Dorner of Mil
wakee for the position of director of the
office.
GEYSER TOO
SPEEDY FOR
YELLOWTAIL
Beats the Chestnut Colt Gal
loping and Lowers a
Coast Record.
It seemed like throwing money to the
birds to back Yellowtail against Geyser,
but that is what a great many did at
Tanforan Park yesterday. The pair
clashed In a seven-furlong ruji,' with such
a rugged play on Foster & Hackett's big
colt at 2Vz to 1 that Geyser's price length
ened to Ito 2. Yellowtall, with Sly at his
heels, went out In front with his usual
showing of speed, but flattened out Badly
before the wire was reached, Geyser win
ning galloping In 1:25 H. a new coast rec
ord. The winner carried only 107 pounds
and looked a legitimate 1 to 4 chance.
In the other events favorites were but
twice successful. Spencer wearing the
empty honors of getting beaten on three.
The weather was summery and the track
in faultless condition.
The defeat of Zoroaster by Potente in
the mile and a furlong handicap caused
consternation In the camp of the short
end players. Chimura was the only other
starter, and with US pounds up, Zoroaster
fell in for heavy support at 1 to 2/
T. Walsh made all the running with Po
tente. winning ridden out a length before
the Shields entry in 1:53%. The latter did
not finish in his usual resolute fashion,
probably being a bit short.
Fast but faint-hearted Oussle F"ay was
sent to the post a slight favorite over
Ella Boland for the opening flve-furlong
scramble. Spencer tried his hand at rat
ing 'her, and she ran unplaced. Riding a
nice race on Ella Boland, Tullett landed
the filly a handy winner over the 15 to 1
shot Isaline. Mountebank finished a close
third.
With Sofala scratched from the two
year-old dash, Corrigan's W. F. Tarpey
ruled an overwhelming favorite. Johnny
Daly on Intrepido broke In advance of hia
Held, leading to the paddock, where the
favorite collared and beat him out with
out effort. Moonbright lost the show to
Scotch Belle.
Mocorlto, an even money favorite, could
finish no better than third in the Blx-fur
long selling recital. Never overburdened
with superfluous speed, she was beaten
to the tape by both Harry Thoburn and
Peace, the former scoring by a neck.
Clght to one was laid about the winner
at post time.
Finally striking a Boft spot, Storm King
romped In ahead of his company in the
last event, at seven furlongs. Miss Soak,
a Â£5 to 1 shot, took the place from Dr.
Marks.
Track Notes.
As there seemed to be a misunderstand
ing all around, Bookmaker Joe Rose was
notified yesterday by President Williams
of the Oakland track that at an early date
his case would be reviewed before the
stewards. Because of receiving no formal
notification Rose was not present at the
stewards' meeting when the ruling was
made warning him off the course across
the bay.

MISS MAY CORLETTE.
IXTEEX people, nine women and seven men, with voices more or less
v^=^s pood and all anxious to go upon the lyric stage, sang for the Boston-
i&r.s yesterday afternoon. There was, however, one nightingale among
the Sot. Miss May Corlette, and by night she had signed a contract
with the celebrated company and arranged to make her debut on Monday
evening next with the Bostonians in Oakland.
Miss Coriette was among the f.rst of the aspirants to sing. When she
had finished her song. "Love's Sorrow." the little group of singer-managers
who were sÂ»Â»a!ed In the auditorium of the theater looked in wonder at one
another. ThÂ«-n Mr. Barnabce. with an enthusiasm that would not be sup
pressed, railed out "Good." and as the modest little girl was slipping out the
side door Mr. I'acDonald, who was on the stage, stopped her and asked
her to wai\
It didn't take very long for the managers to agree that In Miss Corlette
they had found a modest younp woman with a marvelous contralto voice,
one of thci(Â»<* California "nightingales" one hears of In print so very often,
but alas so seldom hears. When Mr. Mac Donald approached Miss Corlefte
with an offer to become a member of the celebrated Bostunlans she was as â¢
astonished as the managers were when they heard the unpretentious little
frirl giv^ forth those wonderful sympathetic notes. Of course she accepted,
wildly excited at what she termed her splendid luck.
The new member of the Bostonians owes everything that she has won to
her own hard work and perseverance. She has known want and privation.
She has labored hard and late for little pay and has found In her music her
pole comfort and pleasure. With aU ncr great love for music and with all the
many paciiflces she has made in its tame she has never heard the Bostonians
sing. To go to hear this celebrated company has been a matter far beyond her
means. Last evening she enjoyed thnt unusual pleasure. She heard the Bos
tonians in "The Viceroy" as the guest of their managers.
"I have been studying music all my life," said Mist Corlette yesterday in
bftwwn her bursts of exclamations over her rare good luck. "I have had les
sons for four years from Mrs. Frank Elliott, and I worked hard to pay for
them. Music is my life. I would rather sing than eat. As music is my greatest
joy, so it has bÂ»Â»en my greatest sorrow. My mother disapproved of my sing
ing and my desire to go upon tho sta<e- We quarreled about it and she threv
m<Â» out of the house. I have been working for Mrs. Bernheim In a stationery
Ftore on Polk strict. Three -weeks ago I left my situation. My little slsfr.
who has been the sharer of all my troubles and my companion in misery, re
placed me In the shop. Yesterday I was so blue, and to-day I'm the happiest
girl in all the world."
Miss Corlette's voice is a contralto with a two-octave range. It Is pure and
sympathetic and has a remarkable carrying quality. The young lady has done
considerable church work in this city, having sung in the choirs of St. Mary's,
St. Charles and the First Baptist churches. This San Francisco girl, whom
the Kostonians look upon a-s a future star. Is the daughter of Mrs. Adolph
Barraillax; of *.0S F"ulton Ptreet.
Another voice which pleased the Bostonians greatly was that of Miss Lulu
Daniells of Alameda, another contralto, and they have taken her name and
residence with them for future reference.

WITTMAN MAY SECURE A PLUM
SEYMOTJB AND SPILL ANE ALSO
IN THE RUNNING.
Present Chief of Detectives Will Be
tire in April and Make Way for
the Elevation of the
Mayor's Favorite. :
If the programme which the wise ones
say has been promulgated recently goes
through. Lieutenant of Police Frederick
L. Bsola will In two months receive his
reward for "gracefully . withdrawing"
from the fight for the chieftainship of the
local Police Department. In April Cap
tain Ben liohen, chief of the detective
force, will attain his sixty-fifth year, and
he has formally announced that upon that
occasion he will retire from the depart
ment with the generous pension which the
law provides. It will devolve upon Chief
Sullivan to name his successor. lie ha*
the choice and the appointment, as the
Police Commission has nothing whatever
to say in the matter save in an advisory
way, and it is said that when Mr. Sullivan
accepted the office it was with the under
standing that he was to be unhampered
in the exercise of those prerogatives
which are his by virtue of the charter.
It is generally understood, however,
that the new Chief is willing to ignore
the fact that he is absolutely untram
meled and throw to Ksola the sop that
his forced prominence and his likewise
forced retirement appear to demand. Of
a consequence he will be promoted to a
captaincy to succeed some one of the pres
ent captains who will be elevated to Bo
hen's position. Those who are In a posi
tion to know say that it is Wittman, at
present in charge of the northern district,
who will assume control of the detective
force and make room for Esola and hia
backers, but there are BtiU others who
claim that Bohen's successor has not yet
been selected and that Captains Splllane
and Seymour have an equal chance with
"Wittman In the race for the "upper
office."
Although the programme as it stands
hns Wittman written In it for the Job,
there is as yet no definite decision, but
the fact Is established beyond doubt that
Hohen's retirement will make room for
nobody but Ksola and that as soon as the
veteran head of the detective force is re
tired and his successor named the late
candidate for Mr. Sullivan's present posi
tion will be paid value received for his al
leged "withdrawal" by regular promotion
by the commission.

POOLROOM ORDINANCE
DISCUSSED IN COMMITTEE
DETERMINED EFFORT TO PER
MIT INGLESIDE RACING.
Supervisors Are Opposed to Down
town Betting, but Are Favorably
Inclined to Horse Racing.
The Supervisors' Police Committee yes
terday took up the consideration of the
proposed ordinance "prohibiting pool sell
ing, bookmaking or betting on contests,
and prohibiting all persons from visiting
places where pools are sold or bets or
wagers are made upon any contest or
upon any contingent issue." The penalty
provided for any violation of the ordi
nance is a fine of |250, or imprisonment for
ninety days, or both.
The newly appointed Chief of Police,
William P. Sullivan, and Captain Witt
man were -present, and expressed their
views regarding the contemplated meas
ure. Captain Wittman informed the
board that under the present order it
is only possible to arrest the sellers of
pools. It was not a misdemeanor to be
present, and he advocated the passage
of the order in order to correct existing
abuses.
Attorney J. S. Drum argued against the
order as being too sweeping in character.
He asked that the selling of pools on
boxing or other contests be allowed within
certain restrictions. Â¦ He suggested that
minors be prevented .from visiting the
poolrooms: that a license be imposed, and
that the betting be limited to two days
before a contest.
F. S. Greene, secretary of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, also objected to the
ordinance. In his remarks It developed
that a strong effort will be made to have
the ordinance prohibiting racing at Ingle
side repealed. Hte asked that the new
ordinance be so framed that betting be
permitted within the inclosure where rac
ing was going on. He stated that the
property at Ingleslde which had cost over
$600,000 was practically valueless owing to
adverse legislation. He believed that the
order should permit betting for at least
sixty days, and* his concern would be
willing to pay a license for the privilege.
To a question of Captain Wlttman's as to
whether he did not think that all the
antipathy to horse racing came from the
downtown poolrooms, Greene replied that
he could not answer, although later he
admitted that the poolrooms were detri
mental to the Interests which he repre
sented.
Captain Wittman, in reply to Chair
man Tobin. stated that the Police De
partment had no statistics showing that
arrests for embezzlements and other
crimes were directly traceable to betting
on horse racing, but he believed that the
downtown poolrooms should be eliminated
and stringent measures adopted.
Supervisor Tobin expressed himself In
favor of allowing horse racing for a lim
ited period, as the sport tended to en
courage many industries, such as farm
ing, breeding, etc. He thought there was
a distinction between horse racing and
prize fighting, inasmuch as the latter
sport had greatly deteriorated. Helms
was In favor- of allowing betting within
the inclosures where the sport was held,
and also the licensing of poolrooms. Reed
took a middle course and advocated post
poning the consideration one week. In or
der, tohear from several sporting au
thorities regarding the advisability of
passing any drastic measures.
MISSION TRACKS
TO BE DECLARED
PUBLIC NUISANCE
Supervisors to Order
Them Removed.
A great victory was won yesterday by
the residents of the Mission when the
Supervisors' Street Committee practically
decided to recommend the passage of an
ordinance to compel the Southern Pa
cific Company to remove its tracks in the
Mission district. It was the unanimous
opinion of the members that the tracks
Were a nuisance that should be abated
and that the Board of Supervisors has
the power to order the removal of the
tracks, notwithstanding the contention of
the Kentucky corporation that the whole
matter was one of State Jurisdiction. The
committee will report in favor of the pe
titions .of the Sunnyside Improvement
Company and the Mission Federation
Clubs, asking for the passage of the or
dinance. Action on the ordinance Itself
was, however, postponed until the next
meeting in order that a legal doubt can
be settled regarding the selection of an
official newspaper. Supervisor Maguire
stated that he had received an informal
opinion from â¢ City Attorney Lane
to the effect that the clause in
viting proposals providing for the
requirement of the Allied Printing
Trades Council label was unconstitu
tional. In order therefore that the cor
poration should not interpose any legal
technicalities against the board carrying
out the provision of the ordinance. Su
pervisor Booth expressed his inten
tion of introducing the following reso
lution at the next meeting of the board,
so that there would be no danger of the
measure miscarrying: '-*. . ;,\
Whereas, In the proposal notice inviting:
bids for doing official advertising it has
â¢ been recited, "bidders are Â¦ hereby notified
â¢ that In accordance with the practice here
tofore followed by the Board of Super
visors bldÃ Â¦will only be considered when
Rendered by bidders who offer to perform

had the rlftht to use the Allied Printing
Trades Council I Label at the time of first
publication of this notice," and
"Whereas, This clause conflicts with exist
ing laws; therefore.
Resolved, That the clerk 'be and is hereby

open session of. the board on Monday.

The protest of the Real Estate Develop
ment Company against the granting of a
franchise to the Bay and Coast Rallroa-i
Company to use certain streets for en
trance into the city for a coast line was
favorably considered and the franchise
was denied. It was the sense of the com
mittee that the company was unable to
show that It had -at least fifty mile* of
road already constructed to this county
line, and as the charter- expressly con
tains such a requirement the committee
decided that It had no power to grant the
franchise.
The committee also decided In favor of
the protest of the street cleaning employee
against the contemplated cut In the ap
propriation for street cleaning work and
against the cut in the wages of the street
sweepers.
The committee recommended that Gray
Brothers' quarry, located near Clipper
and Douglass streets, be declared a nuis
ance and that the firm be require! to
abate it within ninety days, or the permit
for blasting and rock crushing will be re
voked.
pathetic hand was outstretched to him.
The local sporting men say they cannot
see why O'Brien should walk Into danger
after making his antagonist look like the
merest tyro. The developments of the
last twenty-four hours have blighted
O'Brien's prospects in this city, and it is
probable that he will return to hia home
in Philadelphia a wiser and a richer man.
O'BRIEN'S OWN
MONEY WENT ON
PETER JACKSON
Philadelphia Pugilist
Sold Himself.
J. C. Humphreys Tried to Prevent
O'Brien From Doing Crooked
Workâ How the Deal
Was Made.
?
The Call has It on the best authority
that "Jack" OBrien of Philadelphia de
liberately laid down to his dusky op
ponent on Wednesday night. Knowing
that In the event of victory he would only
secure $500, O'Brien drew $2165 from the
bank, it is said, and turned it over to hla
intimate friend "Billy" White to bet on
Jackson to win. White feared to bet the
large sum, as he was known around tin
poolrooms, so he gave the money to
"Jack" Cribin, who acted as disbursing
agent. The latter went to the various
poolrooms and bet the entire sum â¢ in
amounts of $100. A part of the money was
placed in the mutuels, but the greater
portion was bet on the result of the bat
tle.
A large number of friends were let in on
the deal and as a result reaped a golden
harvest. J. C. â¢ Humphreys, the well
known horseman, who is looking out for
Harry Corbett'a interests while the latter
is in the East,, had an inkling before the
men stepped Into the ring that the fight
was not "on the square." As was stated
exclusively In yesterday's Call, Mr. Hum
phreys drove out to O'Brien's training
quarters and after Informing the Philadei
phian that ugly rumors were afloat offered
to present iiim with $200 if he would go
in and ' win. The same evening Air.
Humphreys met O'Brien and doubled his
offer. Although O'Brien faithfully prom
ised to do his utmost to defeat hla col
ored opponent, Mr. Humphreys was still
suspicious. He sent for Tim McGrath.
the trainer, who recently returned from the
East with Frank McConnell. and em
ployed him to go behind O'Brien ami in
structed him not to tolerate any faking.
McGrath followed out his instructions, but
even he, astute as he is in his chosen busi
ness, was unable to detect simulation on
the part of his man. "Tim" said yester
day that he was in the ring: in the interest
of Mr. ' Humphreys and 'he was on the
lookout' for false dealing, but he was un
able to discover any.
"I was with O'Brien many hours before
the tight," he said, "and I was In hla cor
ner during the battle, but 1 did not think
he was, faking. Before he went into the
ring I told him what suspicions had been
cast on the 'go,' and I warned him
that if I saw anything 'flshy'
I would not stand for it, but
would Â¦â¢ call â¢ the referee's' attention
to it immediately. He Â¦ assured me that
he ' was there to win and would do his
best to gain a victory. I believed him,
and throughout the fight I watched him
carefully. It Is my opinion he fought to
win and was legitimately defeated.
George Kavanaugh, a particular friend
of O'Brien, Informed different people
yesterday that he played the right line
and won $400. One of the pool sellers at
Corbett's,' seeing where all the "wise"
money. was going, drew $150 out of the
bank and. played It on the colored man
and is to-day several hundred dollars
richer.
O'Brien is either one of the best actors
in the ring to-day or is a much-abused
man. Hundreds of spectators at the fight
voiced their opinion that. he â¢'laid down."
When â¢he fell groaning to the padding in
the thirteenth round he was jeered -by
the spectators. In contests gone by It
has been the custom of the crowd to cheer
loudly for the defeated man In. apprecia
tion of 'his pluck and endurance, but
when. O'Brien staggered out of the ring
"a defeated man the groans of the spec
tators drowned his own, and not a sym-
