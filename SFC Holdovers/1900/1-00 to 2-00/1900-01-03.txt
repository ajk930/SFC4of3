Even Mayor Phelan gave way to the
pressure that was tjrougrht "ttpori him

originally selected' it to suit the ideas. of.
those whom he accepted as his dicta
tor's. If.was his first intention to make
Reuben H. Lloyd * . Police Commit,
sionex to. satisfy the demands of M.. H.
de Young.. When the 'supporters of
Esola learned this fact they . voiced a
protest and Mayor Phelan scratched the
name of Reuben H. Lloyd from his list
of eligibles. He had also decided to
name D. I. Mahoney as one of the Po
lice Â¦'.Commissioners, but Mr. Mahoney
was' not satisfactory, to the friends of
Esola" and went the way of Lloyd. D.
V, Kelly was also another choice of the
Mayor, but fell before the Esola forces.

department one of the greatest In the

ISAIAH W. LEES, RETIRING CHIEF OF POLICE.
Generals Buller and Joubert
are engaged in a great game of
war before Ladysmith/ like two
experienced chess players,
neither making- any' decisive
moves, but trying to find out the
other's intention. Buller is
anxious to ascertain theiorce left
by the Boers on . Ulangwana
Mountain and the exact loca
tions of the guns in the Colcriso
position. Joubert, thinking this
exclusive attention to the left
center of his position suspicious,
has strengthened the right.
It would be unwise to refuse
to face the facts, and, notwith
standing the optimistic dis-'
patches from some of the cor
respondents on the Tugela River
about the eagerness of the troops
to engage the Boers and prepar
ations completed for the ad
vance, the facts. are that Buller
has before him a .task of the ut-
â¢ With a force which lacks mo
bility and is dependent upon one
line of railway and with cumber
some transport, he has to cross
the Tugela and march to Lady
smith in the face of an enemy su
perior jn mobility and. little infe
rior in numbers and inspired
by success; he has either to turn
the hostile intrenchments or take
the bull by the horns and deliver
a. fresh frontal assault.
It is not obvious how slow
moving infantry are to get round
fast-moving mounted infantry
such as the Boers. .Of course if
it be possible â¢to wait another
month, and if Ladysmith can
hold put- for that time the
sixth division, with more co
lonial mounted Â¦ .troops â 'Â¦ ah
arm in- which Buller is partic
ularly weak â would .be available,
and with "full preparation by the
far/more; powerful artillery npw
at his disposal j' Buller' may suc
ceed in a fresh- frontal; attack.
LONDON, Jan; 3.â Colonel
Pilcher is another British
officer who has adopted
Boer tactics and has gained a
small but strategically important
success. . It has been known for
some time that there was,a.con
siderable Boer force at Douglas,
a small village on the Yaai River,
fifty miles west of the Modder
River. A portion of this force
advanced to Sunnyside, twenty
five miles from Gras Pan, and
was in position to threaten Gen
eral Methuen's line of communi
cation. â¢ i
Colonel Pilcher, with the Aus
tralian Mounted Infantry, com
pletely defeated the Boers and
captured forty prisoners at very
slight loss. Pilcher then pushed
on to Douglas, which he occu
pied. In this position he is on
the extreme of Cronje's right
flank and with the mobile force
at his command is apt to prove a
source of considerable annoy
noyance to that general, espe
cially as it is reported that Meth
uen's mounted troops are al
ready in communication with
From reports of the fighting
there is one. prominent,, .domi
nant fact â that the mounted in
fantry, this time the colonials,
can fight the Boers in their own
way and on their own ground
with a good chance of success.
Aside from this Â¦ encounter,
however, there appears to have
been no other move. The offi
cial report from General French
shows that the fight at. Coles
be'rg was a. stiff one. His night
march from Rensberg -with cav
alry, mounted .infantry and in
fantry, anil his seizing the
heights overlooking Colesberg
to the west of the town, took the
Boers. by surprise, as it was a
march only possible for .a very
mobile column.

The only member of the new com
mission who did not make an absolute
promise to vote for Esola is George
Xewhall, but his course of action was
never a matter of speculation to the
friends of Esola. Mr. New-hall's expe
rience in the Olympic Club stood him
in good stead. He is an adept at fen
cing, and while he would give his ques
tioners no definite answer he permitted
them to understand that he was ready
to obey the wish of the Mayor and
knew what that wish was.
Even Mayor Phelan ha? shown a dis
position to deny the deal by which
E?ola will be made Chief of Police.
His denials are, however, as futile as
those of the new Commissioners. The
Call repeals that Mayor Phalan ap
pointed the Police Commission simply
because he knew that the members
would vote as they had been pledzed to
voteâ for Esola. If the Mayor wishes
the proof of this assertion he may have
it for the asking. He had no alterna

The Police Commission was appoint

Every other consideration of policy in

was subordinated to this end. Candi

benefit was but temporary at best. I
believe I should have contracted the
morphine habit under their care, if my
common sense had not intervened.

In retiring Chief Lees closr s almost half
a century of active consecutive work in

The department as it Is to-day In its effi

of any other man. It is due to him, that
modern methods of police work are In
voruc. Ills Ideas have not only prevailed
in the local police department, but have
been introduced into other metropolitan
systems. Through his efforts very largely
the department has grown, until now it is
the rival of any of the great departments
of the world. In the matter of experience

the island, which will make a majority 01

The commission dealing with the judicial
reforms will include representative Amer

charge of the reorganization of Cuban
criminal jurisprudence and will change
the horrible prison system of the island.
although many minor evils in connection
with the prisons have already been,

"The new Governor General is a man of

was received with -treat satisfaction. The

OVER THE SEIZURES
BERLIN, Jan. 2.â Strict silence Is main
tained in official circles regarding the
seizure of. German steamers, but ttie cor
resnpndent of the Associated Press
learns that the affair has .created an ex
tremely painful Impression in political
circles. Energetic diplomatic steps were
immediately taken in London, and the
lnadmlssabillty of the right of a British
cruiser to search a German mall steamer
on the high seas . has been emphatically
asserted. The Government is awaiting
London's response before taking further
action. .
The press continues to point out the
innovation involved in Great Britain's ac
tion in -seizing a vessel botween neutral
ports and searching for contraband
destined to further transportation In order
to aid the enemy.
The owners of the Deutsohland deny
positively- that she Â¦ contained persons or
goods Â¦ Justifying seizure. ; The Hamburg
Chamber of Commerce reiterates thls^ ex
pressing at the same time a firm convic
tion that satisfaction .will be demanded
and- accorded. Hamburg's trade Is suf
fering, through Buch incidents,- and this

HARRY CORNISH

S u bjected to a G ri 1 1 j ng
Cross Examination.
Special' Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan, 2.â The forty-seventh
day: of the- trial. of Roland Mollneux for
the murder of Mrs. Katherine J. Adams
opened with Harry. Cornish" again On the
stand." .T"he : cross^examtnation'of Cornish
by. Attorney "Weeks was. the feature, of
the day's proceedings.' !" â¢ .' " '
Â¦ Weeks commenced; by Inquiring about
the hour of Cornish's- return home from
the Knickerbocker Athletic Club on the
l)ight' of. December 27, 1S&8. Cornish ac
knowledged that he was mistaken, in pre
vious testimony .as to the' nour." The lines
of the .cross-questioning were sob'h shift
ed,-"Weeks-apparently attempting to' show
that Cornish, after twenty years of car
ing for athletics; ought to know the taste
of brotao seltzer. : . '.-.â¢' . Â¦ '
. The witness was next .compelled, to rui*
i gauptlet of questions regarding. Ms re
lations With various members of the
household: of Mrs. -Adams. Cornish testi
fied' that he went to Chicago In ISD3-, and
that his wife. obtained a divorce frorij htm
In March, 1597.. Under a severe cross-ex
amination he admitted that he knew Mrs.
Small; that she had died in ISJM; that her
real name was Mrs. Patterson.;' that
he had sent the woman, to. a hospital be
fore she died,, and that lie had paid the
expenses incurred in connection with her
burial.- Cornish apparently was Irritated
by the searching questions asked by the
attorney for the defense, and finally re
torted:
. "You ought to know all about that. The
physician told your detectives all about
it."
The witness was closely questioned con
cerning his visit to the office of Mr.
Yocum, whom Cornish styled his "best
friend." He was asked as to the route he
took in going- from Yocum's office uptown
on- December 23. This line of questioning
was significant, as it developed the' fact
that -Cornish passed the' General Post
ofllce and that he had thus been given
the opportunity to mail the poison pack-

toms bcKan to be molded Into laws, and" down
to the present time, a.nd Indeed the laws' and
customs of the IÂ»H'tln rade? as well." have recop
nlzed In t^e flow.lns streams of the lands the
natural outlet of "the sewage of all -populous
communities. Were the city of Chicago situ
ated upon the Illinois River, or were" the entire
'area of the city even situated In the natural
watershed ef the- Desplalnes "River, there would
be no significance in the nians forever to turn
the sewage, of the city down-, the valley of the
Dt-splalnes .and Illinois rivers, but the unique
ne'FÃ of the canal plan is that it restores topo
praphical conditions existing in prehistoric
tinierâwhen the. overflow of waters, if, indeed,
not all waters ot the creat lake rejclon. flowed
down the Mississippi Valley by making: a cut
throtiKh the- placial drift and rock between Cht
caro and" L#ncfcport of an average depth of about
thlrty-nve , feet in order to onrc more restore
the iravlty flow from I-aike Michigan to the
De-plainps and Illinois valleys.
It Is not because a canal has been constructed,
but because a canal has been constructed which
diverts the pewape of the city of Chicago from
its natural outlet through the Chlearo River.
Into the lake to an artificial- outlet from the'
Chlcatro River Into the Desplalnes and Illinois,
that thp citizens of the Illinois and the Missis-:
slppl valleys contend against Ihls artificial
channel in contradistinction to the Inherent
right of communities to dispose of sewage by
the natural gravity flow of the country-

STEAMER ALGOA
RUNS AGROUND
Brought Off by Tugs at
'-Honolulu. :
Epeclal Correspondence of The Call."
HONOLULU, Dec. 26 ; â The big steamer
Algoa was hauled 6ft the reef at 2 o'clock
on Saturday by the tug"EleU. At 8 o'clock
she entered the harbor. The Algoa: is Vhe
largest vessel that ever came "to Jlonolulu.
Much difficulty waa experlihced;in get
tin;? hc-r to an anchorage, as there was no :
spare room in the harbor for her. to- turn
around in. With li^r stern near the. light
house, her bow was close to the ships at
JJkeiike wharf. ..: ...
The: Alcoa had a narrow escape. at the
entrance to the" harbor, lies enormous
weight would have made it impossible to
get her off had she once got solidly
aground. As it was, she was un the bot
tom for about four hours. Xo damtige is
thought to have been done. . â¢ '.' '. â¢'Â¦'.
Captain Hitnsford did not want any pi-:
lot, ho said, last night,'- when the pilot boat
went alongside. Captain McCaufey of the
pilot boat taw the position of .the ocean
monster as she swung around In the en
trance to the. channel. He came to the
conclusion that she. must be aground., and
made all possible haste to the scene. Oh
arriving at the vessel he was: told that he
was not wanted. . â¢ ." . ' â¢ â¢
"You're ashore, aren't you?", yelled the
pilot. " Â¦ : ; \;:i \" -. ;
A voice from the 'Algoa answered:
"Don't know." . -j ;\V Â¦--.; Â¦.--..-.Â¦:-.Â¦ Â¦.â¢.". -.- .:
After making some soundings and find-
Ing that the bow of the Algoa was on the
r>ef, the pilot boat returned. The Eleu
went out as soon as possible, and managed
to get the endangered vessel to a safe
place -of ai.chorage. The Iro<4uois also got
uj> sfam :ind went o;ut, but she did not
get there till after the Algoa was free.
The Algoa is a British steamer, built in
Sundrrland, England, in .IS9Â»>. -She .is one
of the largest freight carriers afloat. She
has on board about 13.000 tons of freight.
2240 btlng for this port. The Algoa's length
Is 473 feet and her width 5S feet. As she
veered around near the Victoria in the
harbor this morning it looked as' though
she could take the whole transport on her
d^ck for a lifeboat. The "Whole- vessel is
built of steel and iron, even the decks beY
ing solid steel. She carries a crew of sev
enty-nine and has the following iofllcers:
Captain K. G. Hanpford, First Officer A.
Lockett. Second Officer W. Brown, Third
Officer J. G. Vickerstaff, Purser A. S. Ed
wards, Chief Engineer A. H. Auld, Second
Engineer J. Cook, Third, Engineer J. Da

There will be some big- bills to pay as a

Justly lay claim to having played a .prominent
part In this great public work. â¢ The Hering
commission, under Mayor -Harrison the first,
made definite recommendations for the disposal
jet Chicago's sewage by tnls inotliO'l. . Liter
a Joint commission". was appointed by the Gen
eral Assembly of Illinois, to 'sit between- ses
sion's and formulate a bill for discussion by the
Thirty-first General Assembly. This cnnimls-,
Eton in. January. ISS9, pre^ohiod to the Gent-rat*
Assembly at Springfield a bill drawn under its
direction and siicgestion by John P. Wilson of
Chicago, which became the. groundwork for the
present sanitary district act. The valley ptople
offered amendment after. amendment: the bill
wna considered in standing committees, in joint
committee, in committees of the whole and in
â¢Ereat detail in the two houses of the General
â¢Assembly of that year, and was finally enacted
Into a law- full of compromises and concessions,
the. sanitary district. CubjeiiT-iriUy, while the
requirements of law." by an affirmative vote of
the people" of the district in November, IS9O. and
it comprises, within its area IS2 square miles.
The popular impression that In its area it" is
practically coextensive with th,e limits of the
city of Chicago is entirely erroneous. As a.
matter of fact, the sanitary district comprises
forty-four square miles In Cicero and Lyons,
â¢which -are not within the city of Chlcaco, and
the city of Chicago, on the other hand, com
prises fifty square miles in Hyde Park, Lake,
Kvanston and Jefferson, which are not within
rhe sanitary district. Consequently, while the
City of Chicago contains 188 square mlies and
the sanitary district IS2 square miles, there is
trally within the combined irea of the two 94
square miles In which there is no. community of
interest as .affecting. the two muhlclrialitiei!.
Every one now freely admits that the entire
city of Chicago should have been made a part
of the sanitary district at the beginning:, but
this was not done and cannot be done without
additional legislation by the General Assembly.
GENERAL VIEW OF THE CANAL NEAR ROMEO
This Picture was taken twelve miles out from Chicago (at point ,arked on small map by a cross), and show the
rock cHannÂ«lrock channel by which the carial eaters the Desplaines Valley
age himself. Cornish never flinched, but
acknowledged bavtng been In that vicin
ity on the afternoon of the day before ha
received the fatal package.
Weeks next succeeded in making tha
witness acknowledge discrepancies con
cerning the time of the receipts of tha
bromo seltzer; also errors In his state
ments to the newspapers as to the manner
.in- which: he was dressed at the Adams
apartments on the morning of the mur
der.- . :.:'Â¦ . .
Weeks succeeded In getting the witness
to acknowledge that in I<OT he wore a
white Elaine- hat with a black band. but :
he denied having worn a hat of this char
acter during ISSB. These questions were
regarded significant chiefly because of the
fact that a person wearing a hat of this
description is known to have rented pri
vate letter boxes and received letters
which have figured in this case.
. After the attorneys for the prosecution
and the defense. Recorder Goff and thÂ©
jurors had questioned Cornish. Harry A.
Kingr. a broker on the Consolidated Ex
rhap^e. was called to the stand. Kin?
testified that Cornish had shown him the
Christmas present which he thought had
been sent by a friend: that he went to
the water cooler. Intending to take a dose>
of the bromo seltzer: that he found no
water in thÂ« cooler and gave up the at
tempt. He identified, the poison bottla
and the bottle holder as those that he
had seen at that time.
The next witness was Patrick J. Ftnner.
the. assistant of Cornish at the Knick
erbocker Athletic Club. He suggested to
Cornish, he said, that It would be well to
save the wrapper from the wastebasket,
where Cornish had thrown It. for the pur
pose of finding, if possible, some clew to
the identity of the sender.
The day's proceedings concluded with
medical testimony which the prosecution
has heretofore kept In the background.
Coroner's Physician Albert T. Weston.
who performed the autopsy upon tha
bj-Iy o* Mrs. \iopis. was ihc first tncii
co! witness of :hÂ« dnjr. Jfe tckl Â»n d.
tall th<; story of the postmortem. Weeks
then cross-examined the witness at groat
lengrth. He elicited the fact that Dr.
We.st.ori had not made a microscopic ex
amination of any part of the body of
Mrs. Adams, though the physician him
self acknowledged the Importance of this.
Court then adjourned until to-morrow.

FREAKS OF THE WIND.
Trouble at Alameda Mole and Dam -
age in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.â A broken apron at
the Alameda mole caused traffic to be
suspended to-day on the narrow-gauge
system of the Southern Pacific Company.
For several hours all travel was by the
broad-g-auge line.. . â¢ .
The trouble was the result of a collision
between the ferry steamer Encinal and
the pier. As the boat was trying to make
a landing in the high wind and rain it
crashed Jnto the pier and tore away the
apron. Several other attempts were then
made to effect a landing, but they were
all unsuccessful and it was found neces
sary to go back to San Francisco, where
the p?.Fsengers were transferred to the
Berkeley.
Six people who were on the Encinal
jumped for the shore after the apron had
been torn away. Others, however, were
detained by the boat's officers. The acci
dent caused a great deal of excitement
among the passengers and there was a
small panic among them.
The rough weather caused a number of
accidents on both water and land. The

Free trial packages of a most remark-

Main Suit Dismissed.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 2.â The domestic trou
bles of H. H. Main, the well-known news
paper man, and his wife, Susan A. Main,
have been patched up, and to-day her at
torneys dismissed the suit she recently
brought for divorce. The complaint was
that of infidelity, and several co-respond
ents were named and some sensational de
velopments were looked for. It is now
claimed that a mistake was made. The
Mains are very prominent. Mr. Main was
for many years publisher of the Evchliik
Herald.
AL NEILL, the best of the Pacific Coast middle-weight boxers, will put
his fortunes to the test on Friday night. His opponent will be Jack
O'Brien of Philadelphia. The men are to meet in the arena of the
National Athletic Club at Woodward's Pavilion. There has been no
betting of any consequence up to the present time. What money has been
placed has been at 10 to 9, with O'Brien favorite.
MaSiy shrewd bettors are of the opinion that Nelll will be Installed favor
ite before the men enter the ring. Neill's reputation rests upon his two de
feats of George Green, these engagements overshadowing the others In which
he has been a principal. O'Brien has a long list of winning bouts to his
credit. His most recent was the defeat of Tommy Tracey. the Australian,
in Chicago. He Is credited with knocking the shifty Tommy off his feet as
easily as a skillful bowler knocks down pins in an alley.
The principals, or their representatives, will meet to-day to decide the all
important question as to who will be the third man In the ring. The illus
trations are from photographs by Bushnell, showing the boxers In favorite
poses. â¢

THE bill at the Orpheum Is pretty
much all new. I was about to say
also that It was pretty much all
good; but In point of fact the good
and the bad is about equally divided. It
is a fact, I think, that one really good act
will compensate one for several Indiffer
ent ones, and as there are a number of
Interesting turns on the Orpheum pro
gramme, one Is repaid for braving the
ralrj to sit It through. It is only when
the trash predominates that one is war
ranted in pronouncing the show bad, and
that is a state of affair that seldom If
ever exists at, the O'Farrell street house.
If occasionally we see there a thoroughly
poor specialty it is, I think, ascribable to
the fact that the management has to take
something on faith. Their attractions fall
below their expectations occasionally, but
one thing is certain, the bad ones never
come back.
Douglass and Ford would be more suit
ed to a temple of amusement where ad
mission Is free, but there are elements of
amusement in all the other contributori,
even those that I would list as mediocre
or Indifferent. John J. Thorn has a humor
ous streak in him which asserts Itself In
what at first promised to be a very dull
sketch. He is accompanied by Grace
Carlton, who, however, Is quite super
fluous, except that she supplies him with
something to talk at.
"Billy" Rice and H. W. Frillman, both
of whom are favorites here, appear In a
sketch of the old-time minstel order with
no pretentions to be otherwise. It Is in
teresting as an example of the evolution
of humor. If Rice were not such a good
type of the old school the thing would be
very flat, which It Is not, thanks to him.
The Rozinos are acrobats, of ability.
Their act. is purely burlesque, but novel
and not lacking in laughing matter.
There Is a decided attractiveness about
the person of Dorothy Drew, who sings
herself Into favor with the greatest pos
sible ease. Her singing of "I'll Leave My
Happy Home For You," which she ad
dresses most enticingly, to the leader of
the orchestra, is worthy of the hit that
It makes, and then when she has the
house with her, she springs a surprise In
all her demure long-skirtedness and
dances with grace and abandon. La
Sylphe dances, too, as only La Sylphe can
dance and Fougere Is as dazzling as ever.

NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â C. J. Hamlin has
bought from his trainer, E. F. Geers, the
black four-year-old pacing colt, Direct
Hal, for $10,000. This probably is the larg
est sum ever paid for a pacer without a
record The colt worked a mile in 2:17
last fall at Louisville, having been trained
only a few Â¦weeks.
Geers bred and raised him. When he
went to California in 1594 with the horses
of v. J. Hamlin he took a*ong with him
his pacing mare, Bessie Hall, by Tom
Hall, the sire of the famous old pacer Hal
fointer, 2:04% that Geers had campaigned
a few years before. While in California
he bred hla mare to Hal Pointer's old
rival the black stallion Direct. 2:05%, and
she foaled in 1596 the colt now known as
Direct Hal.

MYSTERY SURROUNDS THE
WOULD-BE FERRY SUICIDE
The Girl May Have Been Ada Hol
den, Though Her Family Deny
the Allegation.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.â A mystery has de
veloped as to the identity of the young
girl who jumped from the creek route
ferryboat yesterday. It is very 'evident
that the name Bertha Holland that she
gave to Al Rogers, who rescued her, was
not her true name. All efforts made to
day to locate her proved futile, until It
was reported to the Central Police Station
that the girl was Ada Holden, who lives
with her widowed mother on Twelfth
avenue, near -East Eleventh street. This
the family deny, but the police are of
the opinion that this Is the girl, never
theless.
One of the Holden girls tried to commit
suicide some time ago by taking carbolic
acid, and it is thought that there may be
a suicidal strain running In the family.
It is said by some who know the family
that the young girl suspected of being the
one who gave the name of Bertha Hol
land was seen going toward the creek
route boat yesterday afternoon, while
others who also know the fai.illy are
equully certain that they wore in, another
part oi Oakland.
Mrs. Holden and the elder sister deny
the story absolutely, and say: "It Is Im
possible that any one In this family could
have jumped from the ferry-boat yester
day. Ada was with her sister all day yes
terday, and at the time that she was sup
posed to be Jumping 1 from the boat she
was eating- dinner with her sister at a
downtown restaurant."
A young man named Rupert who lives
at Alameda Point to-night reported that
he saw the girl ,who was rescued from the
creek, and she was the Holden girl, whom
he knew.

CAR CONDUCTORS GET
NEW YEAR'S SURPRISE
CHANGE ON THE CALIFORNIA
STREET LINE.
The Comparatively New Men Who
Have Had Some Day Duty Will
Hereafter Work Every
Night in the Year.
There Is wailing from one end of the
California-street cable road to the other.
The cause Is a change that went Into ef
fect among the car conductors of the line
on the first day of the year. Heretofore
the hours of the conductors have varied.
A conductor would have a month of night
duty and then a month of day duty, and
this was considered fair, because all had
about the same day and night duty, tak
ing the year through.
But during the last few days of the old
year an alarming rumor came to some of
the men who have not been on the road as
long as others that they were to be com
pelled to permanently have the night trick
without any alleviation througn occa
sional day service. This proved- to be
based upon facts, for the announcement
was made directly by the superintendent
of the line, and the result was that the
new year was ushered In unpleasantly to
the men who will hereafter work every
night In the year unless there Is a death
or a resignation to put them up a pÂ«g, for
the day work is now counted to be a pro
motion from the night trick.
The aggravation is added to by the fact
that the hours of service have lately been
lengthened a trifle. The last car now
leaves the junction of Market and O'Far
rell streets at 12:32 a. m. instead of 12:15,
as formerly. The night men also have
to relieve the day conductors while they
are at lunch.
The night conductors are not talking for
publication. Indeed, they profess ignor
ance of the change, as a matter of pru
dence, when the subject is Introduced.
The fact is as stated. The precedent, ac
cording to the conductors, was set by
the Market-street system. The Sutter
street road followed suit. The California
street was the last. "The change does not
affect the gripmen. for the present system
is the one that they have been, working
under right along.
GROWERS AT ODDS
WITH RAILROADS
Both Want to Control
Routing of Fruits.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I.OS ANGELES. Jan. 2â A. H. NaftZ
ger. president of the Southern California
Citrus Fruit Exchange, said to-day that
the citrus fruit growers of Southern Cali
fornia will resist to the utmost the effcrt
of the railroads to control the routing of
shipments of citrus fruits to Eastern
points. Just what measures the fruit
growers will take to compel the railroads
to rescind their action he refuses to say.
A large amount of fruit is awaiting ship
ment by the exchange, and also by pri
vate firms and individuals. The situation,
is becoming alarming, ad much of thlÂ»
fruit Is ready for shipment and will not
stand delay.
Â¦ Fifty carloads of oranges are side
tracked at Riverside. The cars were of
fered to the Southern Pacific Consolidated
Forwarding Company, with written in
structions regarding the routes to be
taken beyond the end of the receiving
company.
The agent refused to accept the freight
unless the shipping company would waive
the right to route the cars. This the
company has refused to do. If the rail
way continues its refusal to ship the
freight and the fruit decays damage suits
will be Instituted.
The Santa Fe has likewise refused to
take citrus fruits unless the shipper
waives the light to dictate the route to
be taken to the car's destination. The
shippers have appealed by telegraph to
President Rlpley.
General Freight Agent Chambers of thÂ«
Santa Fe Pacific said to-day that the ac
tion is taken to put all shippers on an.
equality. The rate, he said. Is to be main
tained to everybody, whether they htv/e
any car line interest or not.
"We are going to route the fruit over
lines that will give the best service to
the shipper and by which he can make
prompt deliveries. If the shipper has any
good reason why a certain line be used
In routing we will try to give It to him.
We certainly do not want to antagonize
the Interests of our patrons."

E. J. BALDWIN, WHO HOPES TO WIN ANOTHER FORTUNE
1? UCKY BALDWIN Is planning to retrieve his vanished millions. Un
j daunted by the misfortunes that have beset his pathway and unmindful
J| y. of the fact that he is no longer a young man. he Is about to start life
anew. The paltry remnant of his once vast fortune Is to be the nucleus
of the wealth he hopes to accumulate in his declining years. He believes
that the same opportunities are open to him now as there were In '49,
when he made his first start on the road to wealth. He is convinced that the
same good fortune that followed him then, and from which he gained the
, title of "Lucky," is still with him and that the reverses with which he has
met in his latter years are mere Incidents which will lead him to greater
wealth than he ever possessed before. He has no doubt that a new fortune
will rii-e. phenixlike, from the ashes of his financial wreck.
"Lucky" Baldwin Is fitting out an expedition which will leave here early
in the spring for Cape Nome. It is his ambition and determination to re
enact in the far north the scenes of California's golden days of '49. He
Is going there to begin again what he accomplished here, and with the addi
tional advantage of the experience gainexl In a career almost unparalleled
In the history of those who tempt Dame Fortune he is satisfied that he will
leave the Alaskan gold fields with money to throw at the birds.
The vessel that will carry his expedition has been selected and is now '
practically under charter to the ex-milllonalre. Most of the plans have been
perfected, but some time will be consumed in carrying out the details.
"Lucky" has no idea of acquiring all his wealth with a pick and shovel and
a rocker. If his plans work well most of that kind of work will be done by
the "other fellow." Mr. Baldwin has an eye on most of the gold that will be
mined at Cape Nome during his stay there, and the magnetic Influence through
which he hopes to draw it into his pockets is a mining camp theater, a dance
hall and dancing girls galore.
The amusement resort over which he Intends to preside is to be a portable
affair, built in this city and loaded on to "Lucky's" ship In sections. It will
not be a Baldwin Theater by any means, but one of the swellest show
houses that ever did business in a mining camp. The troupe that will ap
pear before the red-shirted audiences on the Icy shores of Alaska has not
pet been engaged, but all of these little details will be attended to before
the expedition sails and the actors and dancing girls will be part of the com
pany.
Although Mr. Baldwin has passed the allotted "three score and ten," he is
still vigorous and does not think that at his time of life it Is too late to
make a fresh start. If his expedition is a failure, he says, all that he haa
left will go with it. If It is a success he expects to have a fortune com
pared with which his past wealth will be as a mere bagatelle.
GAGE IGNORES
SYMPATHIZERS
OF THE BOERS
Tardily Answers Their
Third Message.
READY FOR A MASS MEETING
,
JOAQUIN MILLER PREPARING
AN ORIGINAL POEM.
If events flow along smoothly and there
Is no hitch in the programme of the Neth
erlands Society, "Wilhelmina," Oom Paul
Kruger and his doughty aids-de-camp
may in the near future have an opportu
nity of perusing a message sent from the
city by the Golden Gateâ a message show-
Ing that not only are there numerous
sympathizers with the little South Afri
can Republic in San Francisco, but that
they are doing everything In their power
in an unofficial way to strengthen the
moral courage of the Afrikanders In their
great contest with the martial hosts of a
mighty nation.
The Transvaal Committee of the society
met at its headquarters .in the Phelan
building last evening and completed ar
rangements for the pro-Boer mass-meet
ing scheduled to be held next Saturday
evening at Metropolitan Temple. Enthu
siasm in the cause the society has es
poused was manifested from the time
President A. F. Groh rapped for order
until poet Joaauln Miller's dripping hat
heralded the advent of the "Singer of the
Sierras" himself, who arrived just In time
to lire a patriotic shot before Una! ad
journment.
At the opening of the meeting President
Groh reported that the mass-meeting
would be enlivened with music rendered
by an orchestra selected from the various
German societies, under the direction of
Professor Ernest Werner. He further
stated that the speakers' committee, com
posed of Supervisor De'asy, Rev. H. T.
Shepard and himself, had seen Mayor
Phelan and asked that official to act as
chairman. Mayor Phelan had thought
best not to take so prominent a part in
the meeting, but had promised to make a
brief address.
Rev. Mr. Shepard then presented the
names of four persons who nad consented
to address the meeting: Mayor Phelan,
ex-Judge Robert Ferral, Rev. Julius
Fuendeling and Joaquin Miller. It was
explained later on that the part the poet
would take would be the recitation of an
original poem. The preacher seemed to
be somewhat annoyed at the attitude of
Governor Gage, who failed to take any
notice of the committee until he had been
written one and telegraphed twice. The
private secretary of the Executive then
sent word that Mr. Gage declined to be
come identified with the affair. The re
port was received as progressive on ac
count of a desire manifested by a number
present that speakers be secured repre
sentative of the Swiss, French, Russian
and Italian nationalities. . .
Treasurer E. T. Cavalho reported that
letters had been sent a large number of
men of national renown asking them â¢to
| send messages of sympathy for the move
ment, to be read from the platform on the
night of the mass-meeting. Among those
addressed were Senators Tillman, Haw
ley, Mason, Pettigrew, Bacon, Foraker,
Hoar, Daniels and Morgan, Archbishop
Ireland. Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, Editors Pul
itzer of the World and Watterson of the
Courier-Journal. ex-President Harrison
and Bourke Cochran.
By unanimous consent Judge M. Cooney
was selected to officiate as chairman of
the mass-meeting. He gracefully accept
ed the decision of the committee, adding,
however, that he would have been better
satisfied If relegated to a less conspicuous
position.
J. J. Caniffe had suggested that the
Transvaal committee hold itself respon
sible for all debts, when the meeting was
interrupted by the door opening and the
intrusion of a large black sombrero, which
was shaken free of raindrops by an un-
seen hand. The speaker paused and
everybody expectantly eyed the door.
Poet Miller followed the hat and was
greeted with applause. He was called on
JUDGMENT MEANS
RUIN, STILL THE
OLD MAN SMILED
Aged Joseph Board
man in His Defense.
DENIES HE BROKE A PROMISE
M.HS. GLADSTONE'S WITNESSES
ON.THE STAND.
Her Lawyer Is Building His Case
Piecemeal in Opposition to the
Objection of Opposing
Counsel.
. Mrs. Elizabeth Gladstone, plump and
apparently cheerful, appeared In Judge
Hunt's court yesterday to press her claim
against aged Joseph Boardman of Oak
land for $500,000 damages for breach of
promise. Mrs. Gladstone brought suit
shortly after the defendant married Miss
Walker of Oakland on June 6, 1899. The
morning session was occupied securing a
jury, the. following being selected to deter
mine I he merits of the plaintiff's claim:
Edward T. Allen. Philip Oppenhelmer,
Solomon Peiser, Adolph lllller, John H.
Kofenbimm, Roy T. Kimball, Charles Al
pers.- F. H. Stelnbach, Julius C Mour
mann. Thomas Heffron, J. G. H. Meyer,'
Juhsh Platslvek.
In the opening of the afternoon session
Eugene Deuprey, who represents Mrs.
Gladstone, called his fh-st witness. Mrs.
S. P. Kelly, to the stand. Mrs. Kelly's
evidence was continually running in con
tact â¢' with objections from A. A. Moore,
who jepresents the defendant, and prac
tically none of her story went to the jury.
Roy K. Langworthy was the next witness.
He said that at one time he called upon
the defendant, who asked him if he was
married. He answered in the affirmative,
whereupon Mr. Bcardman nodded his
head in the direction of a door and said
that he would soon be, too. Longworthy
thought that Mrs. Gladstone was behind
the door, and he concluded from Board
man"? nod that he intended to marry her.
Judge Hunt allowed the evidence to go in
only on. the promise that it would be more
directly connected with the alleged con
tract of betrothal. After. Langworthy had
concluded his testimony Mr. Moore, on be
half of the %defendant, called upon .Mr.
.Deuprey to* produce or prove the contract
other than by piecemeal testimony; but
only a smile. greeted him. Deuprey then
called Dr. George \V. Stimpson. an Oak
land veterinary surgeon, to the stand. Dr.
Stimp^on said that he had called upon Mr.
Koardman, who had told them that Mrs.
Gladstone was a. noble. woman and that
he could not. live without her.
-When the witness made this statement,
Mr. Roardman, his gray head trembling
with excitement, rose and leaned against
a chair. He fastened his eyes on the wit
ness and the smile on his lips changed to
pcorn. Then he slowly turned toward the
woman whom it had been said -he could
not live v.-ithout. :tn<l aw airs his features
lit .up with Â«uppressed merriment. This
closed the first day's trial of the suit
which, if suceeÂ«sful. will leave an aged
man. whose toil alone has brought him
wealth, practically penniless if not a cred
itor of the judgment debtor.
DO NOT FAVOR
REDUCED FARES
ON STREET CARS
Judiciary Committee
Took Action.
WILL REPORT ADVERSELY
ORDER TO MUZZLE GREYHOUNDS
WILL BE REDRAWN.
The Incoming: Board Will Consider
Question of Poll-Tax Collectors'
Salaries â Title Insurance
in the Panhandle.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors decided yesterday to re
port against the passage of the order re
ducing street car fares to workingmen
and school children during certain hours
of the day. Chairman Bylngton, who in
troduced the order, was very anxious that
it should receive favorable consideration
from his colleagues, Algeltinger and
Phelps. but the latter voted against him.
Algeltinger explained his vote by saying
that he had received positive information
from a leading street railway official that
the wages of employes would be mate
rially reduced if the proposed reductions
were put In effect. He expressed himself
as having been at one time In favor of
the order, but he did not like to see wage
earners suffer, and therefore was opposed
to a favorable recommendation.
Phelps jocularly remarked that he would
have to be consistent and vote for the
corporations. He had not been present at
any of the meetings of the committee
when the proposed orders were being dis
cussed, but he had heard that employes
in large numbers had appeared and
moved that the orders be not recom
mended for passage. To Aigeltlngcr's
suggestion that the matter be passed up
to the incoming Board of Supervisors
Phelps replied:
"I am willing to take the responsibility,
and move that the orders be not recom
mended."
Algeltinger voted with Phelps and By
ington voted no.
Julius C. Saulmann appeared before the
committee regarding the payment of poll
tax collectors salaries in Assessor Dodge's
office. Saulmann contended that the As
sessor should pay them, out of the 15 per
cent allowed him for collecting the tax.
"Assessor Dodge," said Saulman, "has
collected about J9t!,000, of which he re
ceived $14,45f> in fees. Under the decision
of the Supreme Court I claim that tiie
tax must pay for lta collection rather than
out of moneys In the general fund. Ki^ht
thousand dollars in salaries has been
paid for the purpose, which should have
come out of the fees allowed to the As
sessor."
After some discussion Aigeltlnger moved
to postpone, so that the new board could
take action, and it was so ordered.
Chairman Bylngton advised that Kal
ben's order to muzzle greyhounds while
training in the public streets be re
drawn to comply with the legal objec
tions, and this will be done.
A. T. Spotts, president of the California
Title Insurance Company, addressed the
committee regarding the bid filed by the
company for furnishing abstracts of title
and title insurance of lots in the panhan
dle and other sections of the city where
condemnation proceedings will be brought.
The amounts of the contracts are. re
spectively. $21,423 51 and $25,114 51. Phelps
and Algeltinger voted to refer it to the
board at to-day's meeting. Bylngton op
posed the motion, because he considers
that the work is not absolutely necessary'
and that there was no competition in the
bidding.

NUEVO IMPROVEMENT
CLUB ELECTS OFFICERS
At a meeting of the Nuevo Potrero Im
provement Club, held last evening in
Reilly's Hall, corner of Twenty-third and
Rhode Island streets, the following of
ficers were installed to act during the en
suing year: President, J. Barduhn; secre
tary, C. F. Kimball; treasurer, George
Outherle, and sergeant at arms, Robert
Davis. An ( executive committee, com
posed of Peter Stolberg, Patrick Reilly,
William Seibert, A. Toombs and A. A.
Schuhman, was also appointed. J. Boodt,
A. Kraig and Frank Kimball were ap
pointed delegates to the Mission Federa
tion of Improvement Clubs. .
The club has proven a powerful factor
in the development of the western slope
of Potrero Heights. Through Its efforts
the Market Street Railway Company was
prevailed upon to extend Its line on
Twenty-fourth street, from Potrero ave
nue to Rhode Island street. The street
has been torn up and the track is now in
course of construction and when com
pleted will increase the property values
of that district. The members of the
Nuevo Club are now laboring to have the
City and County Hospital removed, on the
ground that it is a menace to health and
has a tendency to depreciate property
values. Although it is understood that
the hospital is to be removed to the Alms
house tract in the near future, the resi
dents In its vicinity decline to wait, and
they are making every effort to bring
about its removal. A special committee,
consisting of Patrick Reilly, Peter Stol
berg. George Gutherie and C. F. Kimball.
attorney for the club, has been appointed
to draw up a proper petition for presenta
tion at the proper time.
The storm prevented a number of mem
bers of: the Point Lobos Improvement
Club from attending last night's meeting.
It was the Intention of the members to
elect officers for the ensuing year, but
this was continued until the next meet
ing. The appointees of Mayor Phelan to
the several commissions were approved
and it -was hoped that a new era. of pros
perity was about to commence In the city

"We are in no hurry to quarry away the

TELEGRAPH HILL DISCUSSED.
California Club Ladies Say It Must
Bemain as a Landmark.
The ladies of the California Club have
decided to make an appeal to the city
for the- preservation of Telegraph Hill,
and with that end in view will draft a
set of resolutions setting forth their
stand In the matter.
This was decided upon yesterday after
noon at the regular monthly business
meeting of the club and after the mem
ber* had listened to the report of Miss
Hittell. chairman of the investigating
committee. MlÂ£? Hittell. with a party of
fifteen club members, visited the hill on
the 27th of December and found that the
ejecavatioris now going on made it im
perative that if action was to be taken
In the matter it should be taken Imme
diately. Miss Hittell argued that the hill
was one of (he natural and beautiful
eltes of San Francisco in addition to be- 1
Ing closely identified with the early his
tory of the city.
In : their work to save the hill from
destruction the ladles of the California
Club will have the support and assistance

WITH prayers and eulogies the body of the late John W. Muirhead
was carried from his late home, I-arkln and Hayes streets, yesterday
afternoon. Shortly after 1 o'clock the remains were carried from the
former residence of the deceased to Scottish Hall. Judge Charles
W. Slack, George Davidson, John T. Sullivan, John W. Gillmore, John Mc-
Laren, Samuel Irving, John H. Duncan and Henry Peterson acted as pallbear
ers, and, with the family and many friends of the dead, gathered beside the
coffin as the prayers for the repose of his soul were intoned. Rev. Dr. Mac
kenzie of the First Presbyterian Church delivered the funeral sermon and a
panegyric In his memory. "And there shall be no night there," spoke the minis
ter. "This Is no time for a eulogy," he continued, "as it would be contrary to the
taste of the dead. You all knew him to be an upright, honorable, cheerful,

who has crossed the threshold Into eternity. Life was as sweet to him as to

his lips moved In prayer to God to take him from his pain, and I appreneiul
that when he lay back upon his pillow in his last sleep that those who knew
him said 'Thank God,' for then the pain of life was done."
The choir of the First Presbyterian Church, almost obscured from view
behind the banks of beautiful flowers sent by sympathetic friends, delivered
the funeral hymn. A prayer for the dead, a last look at his face and the
funeral cortege moved to Odd Fellows' crematory. Again Rev. Dr. Mackenzie
offered his prayers for the dead, again A hymn was sung and the sorrowing

SAVED BY BANKERS.
O CCORDING to statements made by authorities
/ \ on financial subjects the flurry in Wall 6treet
* * early in December would have resulted in a
serious panic had not the great banking houses of
New York and of other Eastern cities come to the re
lief of business men who needed help and enabled
them to avoid a sale of their stocks and securities at
a time when such sale would have involved not only
a personal sacrifice but led to a general crash in the
market.
The Financial Chronicle, for example, after re
viewing the situation at the time, says: "To the
credit of our bankers and banks be it said that they
arrested the ruinous liquidation we have referred to
and stayed the panic How often the unthinking
body of our people glibly tells us that these classes
of our citizens are unfeeling, heartless and wholly self
ish. When the financial history of this country dur
ing the last thirty-five years comes to be written â a
period during which the generation now about to
lay off its armor has been active and prominent in
affairs â no class, if tbe inside facts are disclosed, will
be found to have assumed greater risks and shown
greater forgetfulness of self and personal interests
than they have done on many occasions to tide the
country safely over its crises. What are generally
called capitalists are very conservative men. They as
a whole never run risks to make money for them
selves, so they are always able and prepared in time
of danger to lend a hand in bridging the chasm less
conservative men cause."
There may be something of exaggeration in that
statement due to the feeling of relief following the
fear in New York of a panic, but in the main the
statements are not to be disputed- Bankers are in a
certain sense trustees of the financial welfare of the
community they serve, and as a rule they fulfill the
duty well. In this State the bankers have been par
ticularly faithful in conserving the interests of trade,
and during the disastrous panic of 1803, when nearly
every other State in the Union suffered from financial
distrust as well as from industrial depression, Califor
nia stood in that respect almost undisturbed.
From the tone of certain utterances in Congress on
tbe financial question it appears likely the Bryanites
during the approaching campaign will endeavor to
arouse antagonism to the bankers. It is therefore well
at this time for the people to take notice of the proof
just given in New York of the service that bankers
render to the community and to recall what was done
by them in our own State when the stress of disaster
was upon every industry.
Esteemed Friend. Free-Staters. Brother Afrikandersâ The
disaster which threatened us all along has at last overtaken
us and our land will be plunged In & blood bath.. And why?
Let the murderers, the violators oi peace and breakers of
treaties who attack us explain it. "With their usual bold
faced lying they now will pretend that not they, but we. are
the aggressors. Wo the aggressors? Who are they who for
months treated with ccntenipt and threats all d\ir efforts to j
reach a peaceable settlement? Who are they who for months
conveyed troops from all regions of the world to concentrate |
them on our frontiers, to support their friendly advisers? Who
are they who for years have accused us of being oppressors
and tyrants? /
Who are they who while hypocritically pretending not to
intend to violate our independence, yet Incessantly in a pro- j
yoking manner desired to meddle with our home legislation and j
administration? Who enticed, as well as us. their own repre- j
sentatlve here, dec*itfully. Into making proposals which theyde- j
clared to be ready to consider on their merits while they stood j
ready to reject those very same proposals &3 soon as made on j
their own undeniable invitation, as being an insult rendered to !
the British nation with the object of picking a quarrel? Who j
are they who under pretense of sustalr-ing the rights of the j
Uitlanders Bided with the capitalists acd rebels in order, to :
pain Naboth's vineyard? Who are they who' have encouraged [
and countenanced the treacherous and rebellious mob of the so- j
called League, in sprite of the cautions of their own High Com- i
rnissioner. ad interim. Sir William Butler, an upright, cele- j
brated and highly respected general, and of Mr. Echrelner, the I
Prime Minister of the only colony of consequence in South ;
Africa?
Who are they who accepted with open eyes a lying petition,
replete with thousands or forged and deceitfully obtained sig
natures, without investigating whether these were genuine and
reliable? Who are they, who, not only In fact, left unpunished J
the shameful invasion of a Jameson, but even tolerated that
the prominent imperial officials, who were his accomplices.
phcuW, under the protection and encouragement of her !
Jiajesty's High Commissioner In South Africa, and of the Sec- j
rfctary of the Colonies, continue in every manner possible to
corrupt, threaten and calumniate country ar.d people In South j
Africa, supported by all the influences which Mammon can '
exert to the shame of our ai?e? Who are these people?
Is it the High Commissioner of her Majesty In South Africa. I
Sir Alfred Milner? Is It the Secretary of the Colonies, Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain? Is it Lord Salisbury and the balance of
tbe British Cabinet? Is It her Majesty, the Queen, and the peo
ple of England? Alas! as yet we had- hoped to be able to
answer tbe last two queries with no, but we are disappointed
In our hope.
The British Cabinet, the British people and the noble, peace
loving old Queen, honored so hiphly by us until now, all have
either consented in the crime, â¢which is committed asramÂ«t us,
or allowed 'themselves to be miÃled by a man like Chamber
lain, In a manner which a just God will not let jro by unpun
ished. If nations are culpable, like individuals, for neglecting
to prevent a' crime, as well as for the committing of it. then
this Premier, that people, that Queen., will not be able, to hide
themselves on the day of judgment behind that unjust admin
iftration. The people who encouraged race hatred, their first
guide and their anointed Queen who allowed such atrocities,*
have made themselves accomplices of the criminal, and If In j

J/OAISERJ /OAISER WILLIAM gave to the German peo-
J\ pie, to Europe and to the world a New Year's
greeting Tfrhich soends like aa utterance from
the middle ages. Ia net one sentence did he give
expression to any aspiration for peace or to any con
Â£<ience that the new century would be marked by the
rule of right and reason over wrong and force, bet,
z s if to show his defiance, of all such sentiments, he
repeated with emphasis a declaration of his old an
cestor, Frederick William I, oi the paramount power
of the sword.
The most characteristic sentence cf the address was
that in which the Kaiser spoke of his army as the
peop'e of Germany. "The first day of the new cen
tury," he taid, "sees our armyâ ia other words, our
peopleâ in arms, gathered around their standards."
Then he went on with the exhortation: "It is for
you, gentlemen, to preserve and employ in the new
century the old qualities by which our forefathers
made the army great, namely, simplicity and modesty
in daily life, unconditional devotion to the royal ser-Â»
vice, the employment of one's whole strength of body
and mind in the ceaseless work of training and de
veloping cur troops; and even as my grandfather la
bored for his army, so will I, in like manner, uner
ringly carry on and carry through the work of re
organizing my navy, in order that it may be justified
in standing by the side of my land forces, and that by
it the German empire may also be in a position to
win the place which it has not yet attained. With the
two united I hope to be enabled, with a firm trust in
the guidance of God, to prove the truth of the saying
of Frederick William I, 'When one in this world
wants to decide something with the pen he does not
do it unless supported by the strength of the sword.' "
It is a strange bit of irony that the most authorita
tive speech of the New Year should have greeted the
opening of the twentieth century with a declaration
of what a war lord hopes to attain by the use of
army and navy. The Kaiser's speeches fortunately no
longer alarm Europe, and no one will expect him to
set forth on a military career in hot haste. Perhaps
the sole purpose of the trumpet tone of his address
was to rouse a public sentiment which would force
the Reichstag to vote the appropriations he needs to
build up his much desired navy. For the Kai*er does
not rule Germany as his warrior ancestors did. He
has to ask for money instead of taking it, and the
spirit of the twentieth century confronts him in his
very household.
Just what the Kaiser aims to do has not yet been
made clear by his friends or by his enemies. It is
doubtful if he himself understands what he is driving
at. That he is jealous of all rival authority fn Ger
many is certain. He quarreled with his father, with his
mother and with Bismarck, and he has been fighting
one Reichstag after another ever since- he came to the
throne. Yet he has never shown any ambition for
wars of conquest. On the contrary, he has been sin
gtUarly peaceful and diplomatic whenever interna
tional controversies have brought him' to the verge of
war. His new declaration, therefore, of a hope to be
enabled to do something under divine guidance by the
use of his army and his navy to give the German em
pire a place it has not yet attained will give rise to
some remarkable speculations. Germany hsfs al
ready a dominant position in Europe. What more
will the Kaiser seek? Does he intend to spoil Russia
of her Germanic provinces along the Baltic or Brit
ain of the empire of the sea?

THE MESSAGE OF REITZ
WE are Â£.S!t to giTt an English translation to
day, a ttatcneat written by Mr. Reitz, Secre
tary cf Slate of the Transvaal Republic, to ilr.
Bligrta*-!, Secretary cf the Orange Free Sxz'z.
'Ia ir:<*:Â£r.znt but elevxtcd language it utters the
truth of history.
Besidtt being z bsgle call to the ipirit of indepen
dence and iclf-gOTernffieat, it !s a sad echo of oppor
tunity lost to Great Britain. In its expressions cf
esteem felt for the Qnzza zrizj be read a ftate of
ir.u:d existing enor.g the Borrs which would hays
Â¦tl-a-A up in South Africa; ia the Tra^svza! and Free
State, itroxg and loyal friends End a'.liej &i the em
pire. Not orJy ha* Mr. Ccamberitun lost this oppcr
tcnity fcr hi* ccustry, tut if Ergiar.d win in the war
he will tike into the empire another e'.emer.t of weak
ness *nd fisal destruction by cozn^'.r.r.g g-urd to bÂ«
kept cm a conquest of itrcng, edf-wDled and rebel-
Jiccv people.
Go a the war day, z people who can be addressed
ir. such larg-sag* as Mr. Reitz uses are those in whom
thÂ» pastion for ir.dependecce can never be subdued,
and England is sure of a lasting errnity, of which she
baÂ« hid coitly and torry erperier.ee with her Irish
subjects, in whom the cense of injury ha; survived the
centuries.
Talk z* the traders a-d Tories nay, the judgment
of the world is with the Boers. The people are
mightier than the policy cf mesarchs and self-seeking
iia:es=:eri, greater than the commercial instinct of
gain. In every country rsea hear of the sangcisary
struggle agairst power that rages en the veldt and by
the rivers cf South Africa. Its progress is noted and
krovm, and that c.~iet force of public opinion which
h the final j-cge of the policy of nations is against
*England- Who hears anywhere, outside of that ern
p:re, of a public rnccting in sympathy with the pre
tÂ«rr.*:ons cf Great Britain? In tbe Cabinets of the dif
ferent Govtmmer.ts there is no expression beyond the
cold formalities compelled by diplomacy. England
h2S raised cp co friend, has no prospect of an ally
except for a consideration, asd* having lost the chance
to count the strong and growing republics ariong her
friends, has sided her own isolation and increased her
difficulties. In addition to this her own best thought
and brain are against her policy. Her philosopher
and students, the tr,en upon whom she must reply for
her real ar.d enduring greatness in history, are against
her.
Suffering from the accumulated aversion of the
world, the is shuffling in the shoes cf the dead em
pires which preceded her, that gained greed with con
qt:ert and were stricken with that leprosy vrhich rots
from the skin to the heart of all nations which regard
phytical force as greater than moral power.

A LIGHT THAT IS FADING.
pZJROM Chicago comes the report that the Wil-
I Ham J. Bryan League of that city has arranged
for a sumptuous banquet on Saturday evening
and Bryan himself has been invited to be present as
the guest of honor and, of course, the principal
speaker. That he will accept goes without saying. It
will be wisdom on his part to do so, for the political
horizon shows many signs that portend the passing of
his glory, and he must speak while he has the center
of the stage.
Prosperity in Nebraska and Kansas has put an end
to th*e discontents that made Bryanism popular thtre
during the hard times, and even the silver mining
States have ceased to regard that as the paramount
industry. Thus the silver agitation no longer agi-
J tates any considerable number of the voters of the
j West. In the â¢ South the outlook for Bryanism is
as it is elsewhere, for the South also has become
prosperous. Vast manufacturing enterprises have
been built tip !n those States and the minds of the

FOREST RESERVATIONS.
Iâ>yURING1 â >yURING his brief visit here Land Commissioner
) Herman was made acquainted with the views
' â of the promoters of forest reservations. There
is a movement begun by the Waters and Forests So
ciety, and urged by the State Board of Trade, the
Sierra Club and ether organizations, to secure a
more exterÂ»ded reservation of the land on the water
shed of Lake Tahoe.
It is a pity that this waj not done before com
! merce had stripped the mountains in that vicinity of
Â¦ the fine primeval forests and left a great part of them
; bare. The owner* of the land, who have removed its
! tirr.V*r, are entitled cr.der existing law to lieu lands
j in the event of their naked holdings being included
in the expected reservation. Of course they will im
mediately locate their lieu scrip upon virgin forest' in
the- public domain ar.d will proceed to cut the timber
and destroy reproduction by fires, and the making of
I the reservation, will only end in duplicating the de-
I 'traction of timber. In this emergency the Commis
sioner seeks amended legislation, which will permit
! the location of lieu scrip only on land of equal con
i dition and value to that which the Government take 3,
â¢ excluding absolutely mineral and oil lands. Cahfor
i nia should back this legislation by every possible in
* fluence. It fills the gap in the law authorizing reser
! vations and makÂ« it true to its purpose of effecting
i the sah-ation of the forests of the country.
This State has an awakened interest in it, because
<of its bearing upon oui . er supply and the storage
â¢ of storm waters.
I When the floods fall upon and pass over forest land
their "delivery is slower, the opportunity to save them
I by storage is better, and the water is less turbid than
when it erodes the bare soil and carries a load of silt
to fill up the reservoirs and in a brief time make them
useless.
Commissioner Herman is thoroughly wise and in
j strutted in the whole forest and water problem and
J see* very dearly that the most important function of
' his office is not in passing the public domain into
j private hands aa rapidly as possible, to be exhausted
! of its natural wealth in timber and forage plants, but
| the conservation of these great resources of wealth to
' make them perpetual. If he shall succeed in the
I reservation of every, square mile of forest and in the
i adoption of a leasehold policy for the grazing lands,
! the renewal upon them of the' natural plants which are
Â¦ the bÂ«t producers of food in beef and mutton, he
I will have accomplished for his country that which
â¢ will be a more lasting tribute to his memory than
j many monuments of brass.

"U'ASinNGTON. Jan. 2.â Chairman Hall
of the House Committee on Military .Af
fairs eÂ»y* pone measure of a general
cfc&racier relating to the oriraxilzatlon of
the army probably will be presented at
this session of Congress. Mr. Hull lias
cor.ferred with the War Department offi
cials ;jr!cr to the holidays for the purpose
cf rtaoJilrg as understanding of what
was needed in the way of military legis
lation, ar.d it is understood bills are being
matured for submission later. He says
present law will do as a temporary
-. : ire. but as it specifically provides
that Ike present organization of the army
sliail cease on July 1. 1301, it Is Imperative
that thSa Congress do something In the
way of army organization. He holds the
view that conditions are too unsettled In
â¢ â¢ Â¦ ijiMppincs and elsewhere to say dett-
I â¢Â¦'!>â¢ as to the r.umV>er of troops needed
j:i h. permanent organization, but is cocn
;. :.t ;iiere r.ever wiil be a reduction of
lfcÂ« r<*sular army back to Â£>.O*X).
rhere are several general features of
army organization which Mr. Hull be
ll, yes will be embodied In such legislation
as :s tr.iicted. These Include the three
battalions formation which was a marked
aVpartu-e Inaugurated by the last act and
h&a irlven general ratisfactlon. Another
feature Is that allowing the army to "ex-
YH.H& from within" by increasing the nu
:r- riraJ strength of the companies instead
of tTtatir.g new regiments. Mr. Hull says
th's feature has proven mest beneficial,
es it pi yes an elastic organization capable
of roaJy expansion in time of need with
out addltlotial; oiUcers and an entire new
Tfct- >'^fT cn?ari!zatk>n of the army also
Is iikcjy to receive attention. Secretary
Root lavors a charge in the present sys
tem frith a view to having a "detail

CONCLUDES THE HEARING
OF CONSPIRACY CASES
French High Court Has Not Arrived
at a Decision Regarding Guerin
and Deroulede.
PARIS. Jan. 2. â The High Court (the
Senate) concluded the hearing of the con
spiracy cases to-day with counsel's speech
in defense of M. Guerin. The court then
retired to deliberate on its Judgment. The
High Court later interrupted its delibera
tions and announced that it had decided
by a vote of 148 to 43 that M. BufTet was
guilty, with extenuating circumstances:
ft acquitted MM. Godeferay and Devcaux,
owing to the large minority in their favor,
and It acquitted MM. Sabran and De
Ramel.
The court then adjourned until to-mor
row without arriving at a decision re
specting MM. Guerin and Deroulede.
ALVISO ELECTRIC RAILWAY.
Contractors About Beady to Begin
Work on the Boad.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 2.â Work on the Alviso
electric railway is to be commenced
within the next two weeks. This and the
harbor Improvement about to be started
by the Government at Alviso will boom
that place and also give San Jose good
water communication with all the coast
towns. The railway has secured rights of
way from all except four of the property
owners between this city and Alviso, and
in these cases condemnation suits will
probably be brought. A force of men Is to
be put to work removing trees along the
right of way. Grading will then be pro
ceeded with.
It is expected that the road will be in
operation Inside of a year. The equipment
will be an up to date electric one and
fitted for both freight and passenger busi
ness. The dredger for the harbor im-
Srovement is now in place and Contractor
IcCann will commence work this week.
Bird Convicted.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 2.â Robert E. Bird, a
fast young man, who rented a horse from
W. C. Westlake and tried to sell it at
Santa Cruz, was to-day convicted of
grand larceny in Judge Ldrigan's court.
The jury was out but a few minutes and
the entire trial. Including the impaneling
of a Jury, occupied but three hours. Two
months ago Bird and Jesse Russell rented
two saddle horses from Westlake. Bird
went to Santa Cruz, where he tried to dis
pose of his horse. Shortly after the horse
was recovered In Watsonville, where it
had been sold, and Bird was arrested.
About the same time Russell was arrested
for renting a horse from a liveryman at
Oakland and disposing of it at Livermore.
The Badger to Be Sold.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.â The Board of
Naval Construction has recommended
that the steamship Badger, lately the
Yumire, shall be sold. The report of the
inspectors shows that It will coat not less
than $250,000 to put the ship into condition
for naval service, and as she cost only
$350,000 at .the beginning of the war it
was decided to recommend to the Secre
tary of the Navy that she be sold. The
ship Is at Mare Island, Cal.
Compton Jury Disagrees.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2.â The Compton
jury, â¢ which was locked up on Saturday
night, being unable to agree, has been
discharged wlthont handing in a verdict.
It Is probable the charge against Charles
Compton of forgery in connection with a
deed will now be dropped, as all the wit
nesses have disappeared and he has been
tried three times, without result.

WEEK'S PROGRAMME IN
SENATE AND HOUSE
Probable Controversy Over Resolu
tions of Inquiry Relative to the
Treasury Department.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2. -Speaker Hen
derson said to-day that no exact pro
gramme of business in the House on the
reassembling to-morrow and during the
balance of the week had been made up.
The speaker and his associates on the
rules committee expect early adjourn
ments until appropriation bills and meas
ures before other committees are ready
for action by the House.
There is some prospect of a sharp con
troversy over the consideration of resolu
tions of inquiry relative to the Treasury
Department. Several members are said
to have prepared resolutions of this char
acter, intending to claim immediate con
sideration for them as "privileged." It
is sal ' however, by those who are au
thorities on House procedure that this
"privilege" would not permit tho con
sideration of resolutions to-morrow, but
if it did they would be referred to a
committee for one week, after which they
could be called up for Immediate consid
eration.
The Senate Committee on Foreign Re
.atlons will meet to-morrow to consider
the bill providing a government for the
Hawaiian Islands. Senator Cullom, the
author of the bill, said to-day that he
hoped it would be reported soon and add
ed that as soon as possible after the ac
tion of the committee he would ask the
Senate no take the bill up for considera
tion. So far as has been made known
there is no general opposition to the bill,
though some of its features will be an
tagonized. A few Senators are urging
that the measure be amended so as to
leave the customs laws applying to the
islands as they now stand and to omit
the provision for a delegate in Congress
for the present, because of the possible
effect of this provision on tho constitu
tion in the interest of Puerto Rico and
posslL.y in the interest of the Philippines,
to say nothing of Cuba.
PETER S. WILKES DEAD.
Was Once a Member of the Confeder-
ate Congress.
STOCKTON, Jan. 2.-Peter S. Wilkes,
the attorney, once a member of the Con
federate Congress, died at his home this
forenoon^ after a lingering chronic ill
ness. The deceased was in his seventy
fourth year.
He was born In Tennessee.' and removed
to Missouri, where he graduated from a
university in 1852. A week afterward he
was elected to the State Legislature.
When the civil war broke out Mr. Wilkes,
who was an active Southerner, induced a
great many of his acquaintances to enlist
in the Southern army. To avoid suspicion
of personal ambition, he declared that he
would never accept an office in the army,
but would remain a private with the com
rades he had induced to Join. He was
generally known as "colonel" during his
later years, but had never held tho title.
During the last year of the war Mr.
Wilkes was elected to the Confederate
Congress. At the close of hostilities he
fled to Mazatlan, Mexico, where he re
mained until about twenty-five years ago,
when he came to this city. Subsequently
he returned to Missouri and there'mar
ried. A widow survives him. The
deceased acquired considerable money
through his marriage, but it was lost In
the Tully financial collapse, which
wrecked so many persons in this city a
number of years ago.
A Prosperous Bank.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 2.â The stock
holders of the Andrews Banking Com
pany of this city at their annual meeting
held here to-day elected the following di
rectors: J. P. Andrews, San Luis Obispo;
Timothy Murphy. Cayucos; Henry Rosso.
Arroyo Grande; George H. Andrews Â«nd
D. M. Meredith. San Luis Obispo. The
directors organized by the re-election of
J. P. Andrews as president and D. M.
Meredith as cashier.. A semi-annual divi
dend of 5 per cent was declared. The
total assets are $200,000 more than last
year. Increase of deposits and Increased
prosperity among farmers is assigned as
the cause of the showing.
Death of Mrs. Anna Palmer.
DENVER, Colo., Jan. 2.â Mrs. Anna
Palmer, for many years principal of Wolfe
Hall, a church school for girls, and one
of the moat celebrated women in the
State, died this morning. Miss Brown,
organist of the Cathedral Mission in San
'Francisco, is a sister of the deceased.
EOMDSMEN SEIZE A
COURT CLERK'S OFFICE
Rumor of a Big Shortage in Omaha
Denied by Oommis
sioners.
OMAHA. Jan. 2. â There was somewhat
of a sensation In the courthouse this even
ing, when the official bondsmen of Albyn
Frank, clerk of the District Court, for
mally took possession of the office, in the
absence of Frank on a visit to his old
home In Falls City.
There ware consequent rumors of a big
shortage, but the commissioners say their
action was due to the fact that Prank's
term expires to-morrow and the new law
changing the emolument of the clerk from
fee office to salary had been challenged
by Frank, who holds that under the con
stitution hie official income cannot be cut
during his term of office. Hence there is
likely to be a legal squabble over the
possession of the funds collected since
July.
homes In which this same lesson might
be repeated daily. .
A . Book 'of Accounts.
Girls will find tt to their advantage to
keep personal accounts; a careful record
of their receipts and expenses. This may
be -done in a simple way and â¢without any
attempt at bookkeeping, as this subject
is ordinarily understood. It is interesting:
to know at the end of the year the total
money spent for hats or gowns or on the
summer vacation, and to balance these
items up against the money spent for
charity "or the sum contributed to the
fresh air fuml or the items for Christmas
gifts. This does not mean that one's life
is to be measured by a dollar ami cent
rule. It may dull one's sentiment to par
cel out a $10 bill into shoes and rtbbona
and poor fund and Christmas gift. At the
same tjme the business method is the only
safe method; it is the only method which
will keep girls from a constant condition
of insolvency. â¢Â¦ It is very poor sentiment
which borrows a dollar to give it to char
ity. : '
' It is not necessary tn ?av how tVa book
of accounts should be kept. No two girls
could pfissihly keep such records in tha
same way. '
How to Write a Receipt.
A receipt Is the written acknowledgment
of . money or other, value received. It
should state for what the value was re
ceived, whether on account Or in full ac
.count, or for some particular purpose. All
receipts should be dated and the signa
ture should be authoritative. If. for in
stance, you owe Walter W. Smith & Co.

that the bill ; be receipted In some such
form as this. You mu3"t satisfy yourself
that Henry Adams is in the employ of
Walter W. Smith & Co.. or that he has
been authorized by them to collect the
bill. In no case should money be paid to
entire; strangers without some assurance
of their business connection. When money
la paW on- an account It is taken as evi
dence the account is considered correct.
If an error or an overcharge is discov
ered In a bill it shouHJ be returned for
correction before any payment Is mad?
A receipt In full of all demands Is evi
dence of a compromise and mutual settle,
ment of all claims between the parties.
All receipts and receipted bills should ba
carefully preserved, not forever, of course
but for a year or two. Do not trust too
much to memory in matters In which
money is concerned. Give receipts and
require them and enter the records la
your own private account book.

The Need of Proper Training. â¢
Girls should be taught businessâ all
girls. By business we do not necessarily
mean the mechanism of banking or the
causes of stock fluctuations or foreign ex
changes, or the . production, transporta
tion and marketing of products. Every
thing nowadays has in It the element of
business. The business training most
needed by girls Is of a more fundamental
character â training in promptness and or
der, in making receipts and expenses har
monize, in anticipating financial contin
gencies, in ordinary business customs and
usages. In the common formalities of law
and in carrying a purse.
Much of this cannot be taught by lec^
tiires. Lectures, as a rule, only aggra
vate the conditions. So long as society
onlers that the purse shall be -carried in
the left hand with palm upward, thumb
on clasp and flbow gracefully curved at
an angle of 100 degTees. leaving the right 1
hand wholly free to attend to the various
other duties for which two hands were
originally ordained, just so long will trol
ley, railway and other public Information
bureaus be required to keep fully
equipped lost and found departments for
the return of purses.
Girls ought to know how to write a re
ceipt, how to make out a check, the
wording of a promissory note and Its le
gal significance and such other business
f firms as are of e very-day use. These
things may not have in them the same
element of culture that is to' be found in
Dante's "Divine Comedy" or in Brown
inÃ's "Dramatic Idylls." 'and their study
is in no danger of becoming a fad, but an
intelligent grasp, of these business afTairs
will give girls a self-confidence which
may help thorn over many discouraging
and embarrassing situations. .
The Usa of Money.
Girls who -are not earning salary or
wages in outside employment should have
a definite weekly or monthly allowance.
It is taken for granted, of course, that
they earn this at home. Idleness should
never be rewarded or paid for by the
month. In matters of this kind- boys and
girls should be on precisely the same
footing. . To work hard, to Improve every
moment, to economize, to avoid debtâ
these are the only sure steps to a com
fortable old age. Girls should be taught
to feel that the allowance money is their
very own; that they have earned it, and
that in spending it they are spending the
returns for their own labor. To get $10
from "papa" to buy him a Christmas
present is not an evidence of sympathy
between capital and labor. The Great
Teacher taught the needful lesson of
economy by asking that the fragments of
loaves and fishes be gathered that noth
ing be lost. There are thousands of
REWARDS FOR
NAVAL OEFICERS
President McKinley's
Recommendations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.-The President
has again taken up the question of re
warding the naval officers who partici
pated In the destruction of Cervera's
fleet off Santiago, and his final conclu
sions will be embodied shortly in recom
mendations to Congress, either in the
form of a renewal of the advancement of
Rear Admiral Sampson and the officers
under him by numbers, with perhap3
some modificationsâ tho ?cheme which the
Senate refused to ratify last springâ or
according to some ether method. The
Secretary of the Navy in his report rec
ommended a^ an alternative proposition
legislation on the. line of the bill intro
duced last spring (Senate Bill 5005), which
provides for three classes of medalsâ one
tor conspicuous conduct in war, one fpr
extraordinary heroism and one for gen
eral meritorious service, tho tlrst to carry
with it a percentage of increase of pay,
based upon the ranit of the recipient ana
calculated to take the place of the in
crease, which would be the result of pro
motion were that the form of reward
given. Kither method would contemplate
in addition the thanks of Congress to the
commander in chief cf the North Atlantic
squadron and the officers and men under
his command, as they were given to the
cpmmander in chief of tho Asiatic squad
ron and the officers and men under his
command. There also has been a sug
gestion for the creation of the grade of
vice admiral for the benefit of Rear Ad
mirals Sampson and Sehley.
Ab a result of the Sampson-Schley con
troversy the reward of all the subordin
ate efflcers in the North Atlantic squad
ron has been blocked up to this time, and
it is the urgent desire of both the Presi
dent and Secretary Long that justice be
done to them and that they obtain the re
wards which they have earned.
Preliminary to a decision on his course
of action, the President and Secretary
Long to-day had a consultation with eight
of the Santiago captains at the White
House. The naval officers present v/ere:
Chadwick of the New York, Cook of the
Brooklyn. Clark of the Oregon, Philip
(now rear admiral) of the Texas, Evans
of the lowa, Hlgginson (now rear ad
miral) of the Massachusetts, Folger of the
New Orleans and Lieutenant Commander
Wainwright of the Gloucester. Rear Ad
miral Sampson was not present.
These commanding officers were espe
cially invited by the President, who desir
ed to hear from their own lips the story
of the battle of Santiago, the ' general
movements and difficulties of the cam
paign, including the cruise of the flying
squadron in search of Cervera's fleet and
their own ideas as to the method of con
ferring the rewards. For two hours the
captains talked with the President, who
manifested keen interest in their personal
accounts of the stirring events off the
south coast of Cuba. Some of the con
troverted questions were gone into at
length.
The consensus of opinion of the naval
officers as developed at the conference
seemed to favor the method of reward
recommended by Secretary Longâ the
conferring of medals which would carry
with them a percentage of increase of pay
in lieu of advancement by numbers. This
would compensate for actual promotion
both by giving increased pay and by giv
ing to the recipients distinction which
would mark them for future service. â¢
At the same time, 'in some cases, it
would work hardship; as for instance in
the case of Captain Clark. Despite the
heroic service in bringing the Oregon
around the Horn In such marvelous style
and the gallant services of the Oregon
in the Santiago fight, Captain Clark to
day is two numbers below his position at
the openinf of the war. This is due to
the advancement of the Manila captains
whose promotions v/ere confirmed by the
Senate. Captain Clark, at the conference
to-day, however, was willing that Secre
tary Longs plan should be adopted in or
der that Justice might be done to the
others.
The President, shortly after the recon
vening of Congress to-morrow, will trans
mit his recommendations. It is not im
probable that in doing so he will accom
pany them by a special message, calling
attention to the grave Injustice which has
been done to the commander In chief, of
ficers and men of the North Atlantic
squadron In so long withholding from
them the rewards to which their gallant
service entitles them.

MINORITY REPORT
IN ROBERTS CASE
Objection to Proposed
Procedure.
Scectal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2 âThe report of
the committee of the House of Repre
sentatives which is investigating the case
of Roberts of Utah will be made
after Congress reassembles, and there is
reason to believe the majority report will
recommend that Roberts be excluded from
the lioure and be not permitted under his
credentials to exercise any prima facie
right to being sworn in. Whether the re
port will be unanimous Is open to doubt,
ns three of the members of the commit
tee are not counted on as positively favor
able to the course* indicated, and this muy
result in the submission of a minority re
port. The minority view, if submitted,
probably will deal with the prima facie
right to be sworn In on credentials which
are regular, and will recommend that
Roberts be 6worn in and thereafter ex
pelled.
The committee will resume Its hearing
on Thursday at 11 o'clock. The testimony
is closed, however. Chairman Tayler of
Ohio having learned that the remaining
witnesses in Utah will not come on.
It is expected therefore that Thursday
will be given to Roberts for his argument
A vote is likely to be taken the latter
part of the week. The chairman, it la ex
pected, will be authorized to draw the re
port and present it to the House.
Tayler and McPherson of the commit
tee were in conference to-day examining

IV. EASY MECHANICAL DRAW- j
' ing. v- Â¦:Â¦"-: i
Noteâ This course, confined as It will be to six
leeaons, cannot do more than present the funda
mental principles of "flat" drawing and help
beginners to become accustomed to the use of
the ordinary drawing Instruments. Even the
merest rudiments should be of large service to
young men engaged In the mechanical trades
Â¦where working drawings are constantly needed.
Lesson No. 1.
Students should provide themselves with
a good ruling pen, good pencils, a com
pass for making ink lines, and a good flat
ruler. A T square, triangles, dividers, a
drawing board, thumb tacks, etc.. will not
be necessary for these simple lessons.
All complex drawings should be made in
pencil before Inking. The pencil lines
should be made fine and light with a hard
pencil, so as to be easily erased or inked
over. To erase strong pencil marks re
quires hard rubbing, which destroys the
surface of the paper. All pencilings
should be done carefully to avoid con
fusion in Inking.
The compass should have both pen and
pencil attachments. The legs should be
bent at the Joints until the lower extrem
ities are parallel or nearly so. The
weight of the compass is sufficient to
cause the ink to flow freely. .
The drawing pen Is filled by dropping
the ink between the nibs while held in a
nearly vertical position. The pen can be
used with a straight edge ruler; the taper
to the points Is sufficient to throw it far
enough away from the edge to prevent
blotting. The breadth of the line is regu
lated by adjusting the screw. If the pen
is not in use, even for a short time, be sure
to take out the ink with a blotter and
dry the pen thoroughly. The nibs should
be kept perfectly bright and clean. The
liquid India ink which comes in bottles is
now generally used.
The exercise 9 in this lesson are intended
to afford practice In the use of the draw
ing pen. Figure 1 shows the method of
holding the pen. The pen is held between
tho thumb and two forefingers, and car
ried along the ruler from left to right,
with the flat blades always parallel to
the direction of the line; otherwise the
pen will either be running on the edge of
one blade only, or in such a position that
the Ink cannot flow freely from its points.
The result In either case will be a broken
or ragged line. Figure 2 shows parallel
lines of differing strength or breadth. In
simple work of this character the lines
need not be penciled first, except the orig
inal rectangles. *
? Â£ 11 5 uro 3 Jf lyes Practice In drawing dot
ted lines. Such lines are necessary in all
kinds of working drawings. The more im
portant ones should be first drawn wltb.
pencil.
Figure 4 gives an Illustration of croesed
lines The student must be careful In
crossing lines, that the first lines are per
fectly dry before the crossing lines are
drawn. It is well to try your pen upon
a separate piece of paper before apply-
Si k /?, the dr Â» w Â»ns. The exercise*
which follow will afford excellent practice
In careful measurements and in the usa
of the drawing pen:
. I ,,P r . aw ,_ a B( l Har Â» each edge of which
is Vfa Inches.
Note-To draw a Â«quarÂ« it is necessary to
have what draughtsmen call a trtangre. This
in simply a ruler of the shape shown la the next
drawing. Â¦ â¢
2. TJ>raw a triangle similar to the Illus
tration, but- without the circle. Dot the
surface so as" to shade it aa evenly aa
possible.
3. Make a rectangle 3 Inches by 2 Inches
and lay it off in half-Inch. squares. Sharta
three of the squares by parallel lines and
two of them entirely black.
4. Make a sketch map of a township:
make It represent six miles square and
divide it with very light lines Into square
miles. Show a railway- by a slotted line
and shade a portion representing five sec
tions, r. ', â¢â¢â¢;â¢ :Â¦-â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ ~.
5. Make a copy of this Â¦ drawing on a
scale four times as large.

CHICAGO, Jan. 2.â The quietude of the
holidays was broken to-day in the wheat pit
and the firmness which characterized that
cereal, derplte the dullness of the festal week,
was turned to decided strength to-day by an
imposing array of bullish news and statistics.
May opened VÂ»c over Saturday at 63V4@69%c,
principally because of the strength of Liver
pool, the English grain center being Influenced
by a decrease In stocks and in the amount on
passaÃe. Trade early was rather light, but
became more active later aB the demand from
tho outside increased. Foreigners were good
buyers and commlsflon houses had large orders
from outside. Bhorts and some others saw
reason for buying .in sympathy with the
strength of the provision market. The an
nouncement of the decrease In the visible sup
ply gave more Impetus to the upward tendency
of the market which already was over the
call ' figure. May ascended to 70H@70%c and
closed strong at over Saturday, at 7O'/4c.
Corn was strong, sympathizing with both the
wheat and the provision markets and sup
ported by independent news. ConfldencÂ« in the
Lull position was bolstered by continued- light
receipts and small country acceptances despite
the good weather for movement. May closed
J,c over Saturday at 33',i<g33%e.
Oats were dull but firm In sympathy with
other grains. May closed %Â®\ic over Satur
day at 24c.

NEW YORK. Jan. 2.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Gold arrivals and General French's victory
caused a jtood feellne in the markets here at
the opening, though business was small. In
the afternoon, however, consols fell from 99%
to 3SH on the dlsapi>olnting; allotment of treas
ury bills, and the other markets were sym
pathetically affected.
Americans began buoyant above parity, but
sagged. New York sold here slightly, and the
close was 4 point below the best. Prices were
bid uj> attain in the street, however. Paris
markets were stronr. Spanish fours were 644
and Ttntos 44S- Other conÂ»er shares were a
shade harder than on last Friday. The copper
fortnightly statistics show stocks down SSI
tons, and supplies decreased 115 S.
Money was easy and the bills were slack.
The tendency is to hold them back awaiting
further gold recel;>s. To-day Â£432.000 gold In
German c^in was bought by the Bank of Eng
land, besides Â£10.000 In bars, and Â£45,000 came

COFFEE HEADACHES
Xeft When Change Was Made to
Â¦Â¦Â¦- 'â¢:.. Postum Food Coffee.
: ."As long as I dra.nk coffee, once every
month regularly I had a bilious sick
headache. I had often read In the pa-
pera about Postum Food Coffee, but,
like lots of people, I thought you were
praisinp your own poods to sell them.
"Finally I asked my husband to buy
me a small package to try. I boiled It
not quite as long as your directions
said, and did not like It. The next
morning I made coffee for breakfast
i^nd had a Kirk headache.
"The third morning I tried Postum
sprain, boiling It about twenty minutes.
Then it tapted good, and the longer I
drank it the better I liked it. That
Â¦was about three months ago. We have
had Postum ever 6ince, and never in
all this time have I had the least kind
ot a headache or beÂ«n sick In any way.
*"I told a brother-in-law of my expe-
rience. He, suffered with bilious head-
aches and was threatened with nerv-
ous prostration. He stopped coffee and
began using Postum Food Coffee, which
he did not like at the first trial, but
coon Rot ro he liked it very much in-
deed, when they learned to make it
r;rhi. It has cured him also.
"Th* following friends have been
hHped by leaving off coffee and using
rostum: D. B. Wieatt. his wife and
Fister; J. H. Mat hews, his wife and
daughter. We .ore naturally very
nrong ad\ocates of Postum Food Cof-
fee."â Lille E. Mathews. 466 Twenty-

NOT READY TO
DIE, BUT DEATH
CAME QUICKLY
The Strange Demise
of J. C. Turner.
OAKLAND. Jan. 2â "l would not care
to have hold of the other end of the wire,
for I am not ready to die yet," raid J. C
Turner to Conductor George Beal on car
12S of the Shattuck avenue line, in Berke
ley this evening. The words had hardly
left his mouth when Turner fell over the
seat of the car, and died before he could
utter another word.
J. C. Turner, who is a brother of Town
Trustee E. Q. Turner of Berkeley, board
ed the Shattuck-avenue car at Russell
street this evening to ride to Berkeley,
lie sat on the roar end of the car and
opened a conversation with Conductor
George Beal. He talked electricity with
the conductor, and was asking him what
harm would result if a telegraph or tele
phone wire should fall across the wires of
a trolley line or an electric light circuit.
"It woudn't do you any harm." replied
Beal
Then it was that Turner made his re
mark about not wanting to be the one
that had hold of the end of the wire, and
almost before the words had died away
he was stricken, and fell over the seat.
The stroke occurred just as the car was
passing Styles Hall.
Beal called Motorman W. S. Lamb to
help him, and they worked over Turner
for a few moments under the Impression
that he had only fainted Seeing that
their work did no good Lamb went back
to his post and hurried the car into
Berkeley. They went to one doctor's of
fice and" to a drug store, but at neither
place could they find medical aid. and
finding that Turner was practically dead
they took him to Brown's undertaking
parlors, at which is located the branch
Morgue.
Dr. Payne finally arrived and pro
nounced the man dead, probably from
heart disease. Turner was well known
in Berkeley, and leaves a widow and one
child.

BLACKBURN CHOSEN
BY ACCLAMATION
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 2.â After four
years of retirement Joseph S. C. Black
burn was chosen to-night by tho joint
caucus of the Democratic members of thÂ©
Legislature as the successor of William
Lindsay in the United States Senate. Not
withstanding Blackburn's nomination
was a foregone conclusion and his election
morally certain, the proceedings of the
caucus to-night were enacted In the pres
ence of a galaxy of Kentucky beauty and
a dense throng of Blackburn admirers.
The caucus convened at 8 o'clock and
was called to order by Senator Goebel,
chairman of the joint caucus. There was
a wild demonstration in the galleries
when Goebel came into the hall before
calling the caucus to order and the cheer
ing continued for several minutes. Sena
tors Alexander and Hays (Democrats)
and McConnell (Popullst> stayed out ot
the caucus.
Blackburn was placed in nomination by
Senator Goebel. who said that the long
est and bitterest right ever waged for a
Senator in this State, which began four
years ago (when Deboe defeated Black
burn; was about to reach its Just termina
tion. The State Capitol rang with cheers
as he placed Blackburn in nomination.
Senator Harris made a seconding speech
and was followed by other members who
eulogized Blackburn and congratulated
the party on the union of all of the Demo
cratic members in returning him to the
Senate. Senator Thomas asked that tht*
roll be called so that every Democratic
member might have an opportunity to go
on record for Blackburn. Senators Alex
ander and Hays failed tÂ» respond to their
names; otherwise the vote was unani

LIGHT ON THE
DREDGING OF
LIKE MERRITT
Mayor Snow Prepares
a Statement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 2.
The questicn of dredging Lake Merritt
has been a vexed one in Oakland for some
time. The park and boulevard fund has
been almost completely depleted. The
great point of contest is whether the mud
from the lake should be deposited around
the lake in convenient places or forced
over the site of the proposed park below
Twelfth street. Mayor Snow has pre
pared a statement showing the condition
of the entire dredging situation, which
statement has been sent to the Board of
Public Works and other municipal bodies
and officers for their guidance, as follows:
It was declared in the original dredging
specifications, upon which the original (In
valid) contract was let by the former Board
of Public Works, that the mud dredged from
the lake should be deposited upon the fol
lowing places, to wit: The northwest arm
of Lake Merritt, the northeast arm of Lake
Merrltt and between Eighth and Twelfth
streets. Only $63,000 has been provided by
the Council for both the dredging and the
flushing gates, notwithstanding the at
tempted appropriation by ordinance of $80,
000 for this purpose, August 23, 1833. And it
was understood by the former Board of
Public Works that dumping grounds conve
nient for the contractor must be provided in
order to secure a low bid for the whole
work.
The orielnal contract having been pro
nounced invalid, the present Board of Pubic
Works advertised for bids and let new and
valid contracts for dredging Lake Merrltt;
and In the interest of the taxpayer the
board has endeavored to secure the accom
plishment of this work at a price not greatly
to exceed the original invalid contract. In
order to do this it will be readily seen
that the specifications which were originally
bid upon could not be materially changed,
and they were not changed. Hut the de
sire on the part of the public, and the de
sire of the board as well, to have the area
between Eighth and Twelfth streets filled
has grown to be a demand. Contract No. 5
is for dredging nearly all of the lake not al
ready dredged under contracts from one to
four. The Hoard of Public Works has drawn
this contract in puch a manner that the
city may, if it chooses to do no, have the
lake completely dredged to a depth of four
feet, in accordance with the original speci
fications regulating the deposit of mud. for
$6880, or the city may require under the same
contract all of the mud to be forced the
greater and more expensive distance to be
tween Eighth and Twelfth streets. The lat
ter requirement will cost (12.G00 additional.
Now because this sum of $12,000 will all
be in excess of the money in the park and
boulevard fund; because the contractor will
not continue the work without pay. but will
discontinue dredging at once, leaving a
great portion of the lake not dredged; be
cause the J6SBO will remain in the treasury
unused until after July 1, 1900: becauae this
sum of $6SSO is sufficient to dredge the wholÂ»
lake. If dredged In accordance with the
original specifications for dumping grounds;
because the city claims as its own park
property much of the northeast and north
west arms upon which the mud may be de
posited, and is therefore Improving its own
property by placing dredgings thereonâ for
these reasons the Board of Public Works la
of the opinion that the filling between
Eighth and Twelfth streets may wisely be
delayed until July 1, 190fl. and be then com
pleted and paid fur to the amount of 112.000.
out of the funds of the new fiscal year, or If
the Council deem it advisable this sum may
be added to the proposed bond issue for
parks and boulevards. The mud for filling
can always be obtained either by the further
deepening of the lake or from the estuary,
between First and Eighth streets, by per
mission from the Secretary of War. which
permission can doubtless be readily secured.
OAKLAND-, J>n. 2.â Thomas White of

this in his answer to the suit brought

The trial of this case will be full of mys

EMMA SUTTER
DESERTED HOME
FOR THE STAGE
Now Her Husband Is
Seeking Divorce.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 2.
A young wife's weariness of quiet do
mestic life and her ambition to shine on
the stage is the real basis of the divorce
suit of Alphonse Sutler against Emma I.
Butter, now pending in the Superior Court
of Alameda County.
Before the couple were married in San
Francisco eight years ago Mrs. Sutter was
Miss Emma Elizabeth Field, a prominent
figure in local society circles. Mr. Sutter
was a bookkeeper "with Miller, Sloss &
Scott, the* big hardware house in the
metropolis. The wedding was an event
of the season, and for a time the couple
lived in happiness; but the dull and lonely
days wearied the bride, who, to dispel the
ennui, secretly began a course of prepara
tion for the histrionic art, and soon her
ambition to appear before the footlights
overcame her love for home and husband.
So. one day last August. Mrs. Sutter
packed her trunk and disappeared, leaving
no note explanatory of her sudden de
parture.
Recently Mr. Sutter received a letter,
postmarked Honolulu, wherein the desert
ing spouse expressed her sorrow at having
left him. explaining that home life had
proved unbearable to her and that she
had determined henceforth to seek fame
on the stage. *
Word now comes from New Tork that
Mrs. Sutter has partly achieved her ambi
tion and that she appeared there as an
actress under her maiden name of Field.
MICHIGAN MILITIA
OFFICIALS IN DISGRACE
Accused of Having Defrauded the
State, They Are Believed to
Have Fled.
LANSING. Mich.. Jan. 2.â Neither ex-
Quartermaster General White of Grand
Rapids nor Adjutant General Marsh of
Allegan can be found to-night, and it is
alleged they have left the State. Gen
eral White sent a letter to one of his as
sociates saying he might not be herrd
from for several months. Rtid asking that
his business affairs be settled. In the let
ter he protested his innocence of any
wrong-doing, but declared he was being
made a scapegoat for others in an alleged
crooked military deal, and could not hope
to stand up under the burden.
The allegeu crooked deal was the re
puted sale of over $50,000 worth of State
property by the State Military Board to
the "Illinois Supply Company" for $10,000
and the alleged repurchase of the same
by the Henderson-Amer Company of Kal
amazoo for about $50,000.
FACTS RELATING TO
THE SEIZURE OF FLOUR
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.-The State De
partment to-day received from Embas
sador Choate at London by cable a state
ment of the facts he had developed in con
nection with the seizure by British war
ships of American goods on the threo
merchant vessels Beatrice, Mashona and
Maria. The goods comprised not oriy
flour, but miscellaneous articles of com
mon trade. They were shipped for Lour
enzo Marquez in British and German
ships, but our officials contend that they
were not subject to seizure. They cou'.d
not, however, lodge representations on the
subject until they possessed a knowledge
of the facts, and as soon as Mr. Choate's
statement came to hand to-day instruc
tion was cabled to him to Inform the Brit
ish Government that we could not admit
the right of the seizure in these cases
This Is the preliminary step usually
taken in such negotiations. Next in order
will be a report from our consular rep
resentatives at Lourenzo Marquez re
specting the present condition of the seized
or detained goods and the damage sus
tained. The State Department is not yet
fully Informed on these points, necessary
in the further presentation of the cases. It
is not even known just where the goods
are, or if they have all been seized or only
in part. It will be the duty of our consu
lar agent at Lourenzo Marquez to ascer
tain and report these facts, and he is now
engaged in doing this under the original
instructions of the State Department.
While the department is acting as it
promised In the beginning to firmly pro
tect all American rights of trade. It is
showing no unseemly haste In the pre
sentation of the case. To-day's Instruction
to Mr. Choate was not a demand for the
release of the goods, nor yet for indem
nity, but rather a precautionary notice to
the British Government to save all of our
rights in the case. It will be sufficient to
initiate the settlement of the matter by
negotiation, the State Department having
not the slightest doubt that the British
authorities will make full amends to the
owners of the goods when the facts are
laid before them.

I/OS ANGELES, Jan. 2.â lt is stated to
day that the evident reason for the sud
den flight of Aaron Wolfsohn, who came
here to clear up the mystery concerning
the suicide of another man supposed to

County District Attorney lends color to,
the story by saying that he has been
repeatedly asked to bring a murder
charge against Wolfsohn. "'-' *Â¦'Â¦Â¦"Â¦_Â¦Â¦'

Wolfsohn is the man who was insured.

HANNA WILL MANAGE
THE COMING CAMPAIGN
Senator Decides to Kemain at the
Head of the Republican
Commitee.
CLEVELAND. Ohio. Jan. 2.â According
to the Cleveland Leader, information re
ceived by it from a source second only
to President McKinley and Senator
Hanna is to the effect that not only will
Sonatnr Hanna be the chairman of the
next Kepubllcan national committee, but
he will be both temporary and permanent
chairman of the Republican national con
vention. This statement may, perhaps,
be explained upon the hypothesis that
such is the expressed wl?h of President
McKinley and that, the President being
the only candidate before the convention
for the office he holds, the delegates will
cheerfully acquiesce.
The statement is made that the only
question which has ever existed as to the
continuation of Senator Hanna's leader
ship in the coming campaign was that re
garding his health. lie oas now an
nounced his willingness to undertake the
new task next year, and the President's
wish in that respect is to he gratified.
Tho same source of information Is au
thority for the statement that the dele
gates at large from Ohio to the Republi
can national convention will be Senators
Hanna and Foraker, Governor Nash and
General Dick, chairman of the State

What promises to develop into a 'most
bitter contest over the J5O-.000 estate". Â«
Lafayette Brooks, who died December .W
last, was filed late this afternoon in -the
Superior Court. â¢ Â¦' . *."Â¦â¢
Alice M. Wilkinson, sole, surviving
daughter of decedent, appears as contest
ant, opposing the probate of the. will
dated April 14. 1599, filed December 22 last;
by the widow, Mary P. Brook's, and. J. 11:
Brooks, a son. who ask lor letters' of. ad
ministration.
According to the will, typewritten- In
form, testator, on March 7, ISDB. . deeded
certain realty to the widow, and on- thej
date of the execution of the will he fur
ther deeded to her four valuable, lots an
Twelfth avenue. East Oakland. A be
quc-t is made to the daughter,. Mrs. Wil
kinson, in the way of a cancellation of a
$3000 note held against her on a loan .with
which she erected her home; to a son, "S.
H. Brooks, a newspaper route Is 'â¢be
queathed; and the residue of the estate la
ordered divided between the widow; and ;
J. H. Brooks, who in their petition- give
the value of the estate as bout $12.000..
Mary P. Brooks was Brooks'- second
wife, they having marrted about- ten
years ago, and Mrs. Brooks' relations
with Mrs. "Wilkinson, . her stepdaughter,
according to the contest filed to-day-.' to
gether with a suit wherein Mrs. Wtlklh-*
son seeks to have the deeds mentioned In
the will canceled and set aside.; have not
been congenial. ' â¢
In Mrs. Wilkinson's contest, prepared
by Attorneys Chapman & Clift and Lloyd
P. Larue. it is alleged her father was. in
sane at the time of executing the alleged
will and had been of unsound mind '.for
at least six years prior thereto. Contest
ant denies that Lafayette Brooks,' who
was aged 6S years, ever executed trie- al
leged will or that it was subscribed either
by himself or any person in his behalf,
or acknowledged by him to any attesting
witnesses.
The contest recites that Capitalist
Brooks "for a period of six years prior to
his death was a confirmed invalid and had
been afflicted with freauent severe at
tacks of mental paralysis which pro
gressed in violence up to the time of exe
cuting the will, that his mind had become
so weakened that he could be easily in
fluenced by those around him, and that he
was Incompetent to transact any business
whatsoever."
Contestant charges that her stepmother,
Mary P. Brooks, "for many years exer
cised complete control and dominion over
the mind and conduct of decedent by rea
son of his mental weakness," and "that
decedent had always regarded contestant
with utmost kindneÂ»3 and she never did
an act to forfeit this kindness and es
teem; that from the time Hary P. Brooks
pained ascendency over decedent's mind
she never, except on one occasion, per
mitted contestant and decedent to be to
gether alor.e; that, though contestant re
sided but 600 feet from his home, she was
never made aware of his dangerous con
dition; that by reason of the undue Influ
ence exercised by Mary P. Brooks over
him he executed conveyances to her of all
his real property, of the value of 115,000.
which was acquired prior to his marriage;
that the total value of his estate, includ
ing the said realty, was JGO.OOO and up
ward; that contestant is excluded from
the prox-isions of said will and that the
$3030 note mentioned In Â¦ said will was
never intended by either party to be-col
lectible."
In the complaint to have the deeds can
celed A. E. Wilkinson, husband of con
testant, is Joined as a party plaintiff, and'
the allegations on which she bases her
cause of action are almost identical to
those recited In her opposition to the pro
bate of the will.

Death of Rev. F. J.
Masters, Berkeley.
BERKELEY. Jan. 2.â Rev. Frederick J.
Masters, superintendent of the Pacific
Coast Methodist Missions and well known
on this coast and in China, died suddenly
this morning at his home. 1740 Oxford
street, Berkeley. He had been suffering
for some time, but his family hardly real
ized the seriousness of his illness.
Dr. Masters spent twenty-four years of
his life in the missionary service. He was
born in Evesham. England, near Strat
ford-on-Avon, forty-nine years ago. After
DELANDY NOW
IN RECEIPT OF
ANOTHER LETTER
Signed "Judge Lynch"
and Menacing.
Delanoy, your threats do not
in the least concern me. You
are afraid to expose me, be
cause if you do you will ex
pose yourself. You are a vil
lain of the worst type. I defy
you to put my name in the
newspapers. You will pay
dearly for it if you do.
JUDGE LYNCH.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 2.-F. N. Delanoy is in
receipt of another anonymous letter. Thi?
time the writer boldly defies his victim to
expose him to the' public. He threatens
dire consequences and signs himself
'â¢Judge Lynch." The letter was mailed
in Alameda to 22.18 Clinton avenue. The
first letter. Pisned '"White Caps," was
mailed in San Francisco. Tt was type
written upon straw-coiored wrapping pa
per. The paper was irregular in shape.
The typewritten matter was all in capi
tals except where small letters were ap
parently struck by mistake. The letter
reads:
"Delanoy: Your threats do not in
the least concern me. You are afraid to
expose me. because if you do you will
expose yourself. You are a villain of the
worst type. I defy you to put my name in
the newspapers. You will pay dearly for
it if you do. JUDGE LYNCtI."
Delanoy is undeterred in his deter
mination to make an expose of the anony
mous persecutor. The threats contained
in "Judge Lynch's" epistle haw had the
effect, he says, of urging him to greater
efforts in his purpose of clinching his
nameless Nemesis. He says: "It is Judge
Lynch or the white cap who is on trial for
the cowardly act of sending anonymous
letters Into another man's home. As soon
ns the proofs of his guilt are in proper
shape he will just as surely be publicly
exposed as the sun is to rise to-morrow
morning."

DIRECTORY OF
MODERN YOUTH
BY THE MAYOR
Rare Youngsters of
Second Childhood.
CABINET OF SPECIMENS
TWO CENTURY PLANTS ON THE
PARE COMMISSION.
The maxim, "old men for counsel and
young men for war." Is not to apply to
modern San Francisco. Mayor Phelan
amends the doctrine by declaring that
old men shall not be perpetuated in office.
When pressed for his reasons for assert
ing that Esola was a better man for the
office of Chief of Police than Lees the
Mayor remarked: "This is an adminis
tration of young men."
A roster of the youth appointed by
Mayor Phelan to administer municipal
affairs Is worth special study. At the
head of the column one finds that lusty
youngster Colonel George H. Mendell, U.
S. A., retired. Some years ago Colonel
Mendell, having attained the age of 64
years, was retired from active service in
the United States army. Perhaps the col
onel Is an exceptionâ a modern example
of the "everlasting youth of whom age
cannot wither nor custom stale his Infinite
variety."
Passing from Colonel Mendell the next
youngster on the Board of Public Works
is Jeremiah Mahoney. And a rare boy he
is Indeed. . Down the line further is Mars
den Manson, who is younger in years than
Mr. Mahoney, but as old in office-holding
as any man on the Mayor's precious list
or young men. . If medals were given for
successful achievements in getting and
holding fat oOices Mr. Manson's numerous
decorations would entitle him to ride at
the head of. a Fourth of July procesMon
Passing along to the Park Commission"
one nnds T some more youthful specimens
There is Jasper McDonald, who was a boy
in Kentucky early In the century and has
preservetrhis youth ever since. Happily
Reuben Lloyd, another youth, not rash or
impulsive, is on the commission. He may
exchange reminiscences of the early fifties
with Mr. McDonald and recall many of
the events of ancient San Francisco. Â¦ .
Further along the line of Phelan's im
mortals one bumps up against that frisky
youngster James Denman, who began his
political career by voting for General
would be replaced with those less omin
ous this morning.
"The storm is still with us." he said,
"and may resume operations at any time.
It has not yet gone south of Tehachani.
but I believe it will soon reach there. ThÂ«
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers are
rising, but there Is no damage yet report
ed. At Red Bluff the river is twenty feet
high, which is about eight feet above the
normal, but that is not a surprising height
for this time of year. The seasonal rain
fall to date is nearly twelve inches, which
is a good average. The State needs every
drop of rain that has fallen. This storm
was very accurately foretold and with
the exception of Eureka. - ample notice
was given shipping along the coast.
Eureka could not be reached by telegraph
all day.
"The rainfall should bring out the
croakers of the last two years and
force them into an acknowledgment of
their folly.' These cranks, because there
was a dry season, proclaimed that the
meteorological conditions of the coast
were changing and that California would
soon be a desert. - These fallacies were, of
course,' made the most of by States not
deslrpus of seeing California rob them of
their prestige. Now. these croakers
should be equally vociferous in proclaim
ing that this is not a freak State from
the meteorological standpoint, but pre
serves a very beneficial average."
Around town the storm caused some
damage to trees and fences, and the
washing out of some gravel on Castro
street caused a temporary delay of street
car travel on that line. The peril to life
and limb from the billboards that dis
figure the city was made apparent by
many narrow escapes from injury. An
election booth at O'Farrell and Mason
streets was toppled over.

HE FEARED DISMISSAL iIOBE
THAN DEATH. ;' . V
At the Private Sanitarium Where Ho
Was Taken Small Hope Is .:.'
' Held Out for His Re
covery.
Policeman Lewis E. Meredith, attached
to Captain Gillin's division, attempted to
commit suicide early on Monday morning
at his home, 723 Castro street, by ahootlnj
himself twice in the right- temple. . It U
not expected that he will recover. : .. â¢ .';
During the annual parade of th<* p.olica
December 22 Meredith was ordered out of
the ranks because he was under the Influ
ence of liquor. On his way home he.feV?
from a car and skinned his nose. A charge
of being intoxicated while on duty had
been filed against him, and It would have
been heard to-night by the Police Conn /
missloners. He had beeen brooding ove*
his disgrace and it is supposed that Is.
the reason why he shot himself.
Meredith's wife reported the matter to
the Seventeenth-street station, and since
then Sergeant Petrin has been looking
after the wo'inded officer. Yesterday hÂ»
was removed to Dn Howard a sanitarium.
on Sutter street. In. an unconscious con<2l-Â»
tion, with small hope of his recovery. " . :.Â¦
Mrs. Meredith stated that after they
had ail retired and were asleep her hus
band got out of bed about 2 o'clock in th*
morning and fired two shots into his right
temple. She was awakened by the reports

UNKNOWN MAN DROWNED.
He "Was Too "Weak to Cling to the
Rope Thrown to Him.
Cries of "Help! help!" at 2:30 o'clock
yesterday morning attracted the atten
tion of M. Mullen, watchman of the
Southern' Pacific Railroad slip at Second
and Townsend streets. He rushed to the
end of the dock and saw a man struggling
in the water. Mullen called for assistance,
and Frank Clapp and R. Walsh, two
brakemen, ran to pull on the rope that
Mullen had thrown to the drowning man.
When half out of the water the unfortun
ate man let go his hold and fell back and
was seen no more.
The body of the unknown has hot been
recovered.

is doubtful. Mr. Merriam came to this
city on a visit about ten days aeo. He
stayed at the Occidental Hotel, where he
has some friends, and a few days after his
arrival he showed symptoms of typhoid.
Hip friends advised that he go to a hos
pital. The advice was taken none too
early, as he has now been in a critical
condition for several days.
Internal Revenue Appointments.
Two appointments were made yesterday
by United States Internal Revenue Col
lector Lynch, one being that of B. F. Cas
sidy of this city as deputy collector in
charge of indexing and handling Chinese
registration certificates, and the other
that of L. E. Witteameyer as deputy col
lector in the Fourth District, to fill the
vacancy caused by the transfer of Frank
A. Fletcher to be a storekeeper and gauger
at the bonded warehouses In this city.
New Registration Law.
The Smith registration law passed at
the last session of the Legislature, which
provides for a new registration of voters
every two years, went into effect this
morning. The Registrar's office will be
kept open continuously for purposes of
registration except during the forty days
immediately preceding any election, when
It shall cease as to electors residing in the
territory within which such election is to
be held. Transfers may be made from
one precinct or ward to another in the
same county at any time, except within
twenty-five days Immediately preceding
such election. Registrar Steppacher was
the first to register under the new law,
and the Mayor was the fifth.
WIND SWEPT FIERCELY
OVER THE RESERVATION
SOME SLIGHT DAMAGE DONE AT
THE PRESIDIO.
Speculation on the Successor of Colo
nel Freeman as Post Command
erâA Night of Revelry
on Angel Island.
A few yards of Ivy-covered fence behind
the officers quarters, some broken boughs
and trees uprooted and a generally
combed-out appearance to the whole post
was the record of the storm yesterday at
the Presidio. The damage on the whole
did not amount to much, the only real
wreckage that could be piled was in the
campus, but the huts stood up stiffly to
the wind and not more than a dozen In all
four camps were blown down.
New Year's eve ran a bibulous course
among the men of the Third Artillery
forming the garrison on | Angel Island.
Some of them got leave to row over to
Tlburon during the afternoon, and when
they returned about dusk a goodly cargo
of strong waters was stowed snugly away
under the thwarts and in bow and stern."
The stuff was landed without detection,
and that night twenty or more of the men
held riotous revel. There wa& a good deal
of noise, but no guns were discharged,
nothing was said or done about It â or at
least nothing has been said or done so far.
Word reached the city that half the gar
rison was raising Cain, and the courts
martial of all kinds would speedily follow,
but it was not nearly so bad as that and
Assessor Dodge's Deputies.
Assessor Dodge announced the tempor
ary list of his appointees yesterday aft
ernoon. The men appointed are all old
employes of the office. Before January 8
next he will appoint his deputies, who
will hold for Bixty days until the civil ser
vice clause of the new charter goes into
effect. The new list will probably be the
same as that appointed to-day, which Ir

California Drenched With Rain
so far there seems to be no crop of courts
martial appearing.
Army gossip seems determinedly headed
toward Colonel Rawles of the Third Artil
lery as the probable successor to Colonel
Freeman as commandant of the Presidio.
Colonel Rawles is now commandant of the
post at Angel Island. By those who know
briar ter s sentiments on the proposition
of an artilleryman in charge of the Pre
sidio, however, the coming of Colonel
Rawles is looked upon as something im
probable, unless Rawles' Washington
wires can overcome Shafter's objections
to hUr stripes. As a matter of fact the
Presidio is an infantry post by order of
General Miles, who believed the artillery
branch should be where fortifications or
arsenals are located, leaving the big reser
vations to be garrisoned by. infantry and
cavalry. :
Â¦A. general court-martial has been ap
pointed to meet at the Presidio to-morrow
to clear up the calendar of refractory
before they sail for Manila on
the Tartar. The detail for the court Is as
follows:
Captain Henry C. Danes. Third Artillery.
Captain Joseph M. Califf, Third Artillery.
Captain E. P. Wlllcox, Sixth Cavalry.
Captain E. V. Bookmlller, Ninth Infantry.
Second Lieutenant John C. Raymond, Blxth

Second Lieutenant William Forse. Third Ar

Cavalry, Judge advocate.
The school for private soldiers opened
at the Presidio yesterday under the super
vision of Chaplain J. H. Macomber, with
Private Oliver of Battery I. Third Artil
lery, teacher. These post schools are for
the purpose of instructing soldiers who
are deficient in education.
Acting Assistant Surgeons F. H. Tltm
and Frederick Pearl, and contract Nurses
Cecelia Earhart and Helene Marshall
have been assigned to the Tartar for duty
aboard and for transportation to Manila.
HOT TIME THE
MUSE OF THE
VIOLENT STORM
Oregon Sends Out a
Cold Wave.
TROUBLE WAS INEVITABLE
*ym McADEB STILL FLTES A BED
PENNANT.
High above the Mills building two pen
iiants. rich in danger color, flapped fran
tically all day yesterday. They gave offi
cial indication that the prevailing storm
had shown a desire to linger around San
"Francisco Bay and mirht be expected at
any minute to renew Its violence. The
Jew sickly rays of sunshlDe that pierced
the heavy atmosphere during the after
roon were only a bluffâ a wicked device
of the weather director, cays Forecaster

The heavy storm should not have
caught anybody by surprise. Long before
daylight It was predicted and red flags
were at once hoisted at every point along
the coast where leU-graphic wires
reached. It was not a vagrant disturb
ance. As early as 6 o'clock in the tnorn-
Foreraster McAdie was advised that some
guspidous-looking clouds were navigating
along the â¢ Oregon coast and steering a
course that passed directly over "San
Francisco. This tip, and the barometer,
were all that were necessary to inform
the local weather sharps that a heavy
southeaster would arrive shortly after
breakfast and that it would create a use
for every mackintosh and rubber in town.

m. the wind howled from the southeast,
close on to fifty miles an hour. Although
sudden and sharp the storm was not a
very violent one: it was Just a lively

State needs and should expect at this time
of the year. After the cold spell of two
vr.eeks ago, during which time Oregon was
having a comparatively warm, if not a
hot time. Â«. storm was to be expected, and
no it fell upon this part of the State. Such
is the explanation, according' to the
â¢weather â¢ man, why billboards were
blown down, trees were razed, ferryboats
and car* had to stop and an Inch of rain

Jeremiah Deasy of the Election Com

not yet reached the age of dlscret'on, as
he lost his vote at the late election by an
Indiscreet change of residence.
Posslblv the Mayor may place second

account for several of his appointments.

POLICEMAN PUTS
BULLETS INTO
HIS OWN BRAIN
Meredith Afraid to
Face Charges,
was Just off Goat Island about the time when the Adams was drifting ashore. She was making
very heavy weather of it and hundreds of people along the front watched her with the greatest
of interest. All at once she was. seen to broach to and the next instant an immense wave broke
over her.. Everybody aboard made sure the vessel was going down and a rush was made for the
life preservers. The Berkeley righted herself, however, and finally made her landing without
further mishaps.
The Bay City had a lively time of it at the narrow gauge mole. She carried away the apron
during her plunging and had finally to go to the broad gauge landing to put her passengers ashore.
It was so rough oft Folsom street wharf that the revenue cutters McCulloch .and Rush had
to up anchor and run for shelter off Meiggs wharf. The McCulloch's anchors fouled while they
were being taken in and the vessel rolled gunwales under whilo they were being got inboard.
The gasoline schooner Barbara Hernster, coming in along the seawall, got into difficulties with
the scow War Eagle and the scow suffered considerably. The Hernster was trying to make a land
ing at section 4 and the War Eagle was being warped out when the two came together. The
scow had her railing torn away and the schooner was damaged about her headgear.
The steamer Cleveland went out Sunday bound for Kahului, but put back on account of the
storm. She had a deckload of live stock and Captain Klitgard would not take any chances.
Out of a fleet of fifteen steamers due from Puget Sound and way ports yesterday only one
the George W. Elder from Portland, made port. At sundown the Walla Walla from Puget
Sound: Coquille River and Newburg from Grays Harbor; North Fork from Eureka; Mackinaw,
Elihu Thomson and Czarina, from Seattle: Bristol from Departure Bay; Albion from Tillamook;
Aberdeen from Portland; Noyo from Fort Bragg, and Crescent City and Aloha from Crescent
City, had not been heard from. They will probably make port early to-day.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail steamer Australia got in from Honolulu yesterday
afternoon and was placed in quarantine. The cabin passengers were allowed to land, however, and
were brought ashore on the tug Fearless. The officers Of the steamer say that there was one death
of a white girl at Honolulu on December 22 and two Chinese were found dead in the Chinese quar
ters on Christmas day. These fatalities started the plague scare again and every precaution was
being taken to stamp out the disease when the mall boat left. The Australia only brought one
steerage passenger, a Chinese named Lee Goon. On account of the plague the agents of the vessel
refused to carry any of the half-hundred people who wanted to come to San Francisco second
class. The cabin passengers were: J. A. Driffell, wife and two children, A. G. Eames and wife. Dr.
F. H. Humphries and wife. Dr. Keith and wife, W. H. Wallace and wife, T. Smith and wife. A.

During the morning the Australia got the full force of the grale and there was not a passen
ger aboard that was not glad to reach port. The steamer will be fumigated and released to-day,
after which she will come to the wharf.
Pat Manning fell down the hold of the transport Tartar yesterday and fractured his forearm
and badly lacerated his face.

on which 25 per cent was paid, arrived yesterday at Portland:
A Hurricane From the Southeast Makes Trouble for Shipping.
3^ HE United States training ship Adams had a narrow escape yesterday from total destruc
tion on Goat Island. During the southeaster she dragged her anchors and, shifting broad
elde on into the bight, brought up on the sandy beach near the wharf to which the Pen
i-acola -was tied. :!..-<
The American ship Alexander Gibson broke away from her moorings during the same
storm, the schooner Barbara Hernster was driven down on the scow War Eagle, the ferry
Steamers had a terrible time of it, the mail steamer Australia caught it coming in from Hono
lulu, while the George W. Elder was the only one of the fleet due from northern ports to get In.
The storm came up from the southeast In the night, but lulled during the early morning
hours. At 6 a. m. It was only blowing a light breeze, but three hours later the wind had in
creased to thirty miles an hour at Point Lobos. From that time on the wind gained in strength,
and about 10 a. m. it was piping along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Up to noon it blew a
hurricane and the vessels in the southern part of the bay had a lively time. During the after
noon the gale moderated somewhat, and at 3 p. m. it was only blowing forty miles an hour.
.The training ship Adams came down from Mare Island last Saturday and anchored off the
training station on Goat Island. When the Southeaster was at its height her anchors dragged,
and before steam could be got in the boilers she was ashore. The United States tug Active tried
to tmv her off, but failed, and then a hawser was passed from the Adams to the Pensacola, but
the latter could not budge the training ship with the full power of her donkey engines.
The tide was on the turn and it looked as though the Adams would have to remain in her
dangerous position all night. A telephone message was sent to the Spreckels Towboat Company
.and Superintendent McCoy at once sent the Relief to the assistance of the stranded warship.
' \Chen the tug got over to the island Captain Silovich found a great deal of difficulty in getting
near the Adams. He had to anchor the Relief and allow her to drift down to the stranded vessel
as the anchor chain was paid out.
A four and one-half inch steel hawser was put aboard the Adams and then the tug was
gradually worked up to full speed ahead. It was a long, steady pull and the hawser parted under
the pressure. It was a brand is?w rope and the strain upon it must have been enormous.
While going ashore the Adams' anchor chains had become fouled so it was impossible to get
them up. They were accordingly slipped as Boon as a new hawser was put aboard from the
Relief and then the training ship was towed Into a place of safety. Another set of anchors were
then dropped and she rode ont the gale in safety.
The Alexander Gibson was lying on the north side of Fremont street wharf, loading for
New Tork. When, the storm was at Its highest her bow line parted and the big ship at once
swung around toward Beale street. She struck the wharf and also the barkentine Katie Flickenger
and brought tip. The barkentine was damaged to the extent of about $50, principally about tho
bow, while the wharf had Its underpinning damaged to the extent of $100. When the Gibson's
hawser parted It struck the skylight of the shed on the wharf and tore it clean open. Then when
the ship swung around the barkentine's main boom struck her deckhouse and nearly carried it
overboard. All In all. it will take about $2500 to repair the damage done at the wharves. When the
wind went down the Gibson was hard and fast in the mud. It will be high tide to-day before she
can get back to her berth.
At the mall dock little damage was done, as the stea.ners were all well moored. The waves
broke over the end of the dock, however, and made things very uncomfortable for the Custom
house officers and dock employes.
The ferry steamers had a very lively time of it during the early hours of the day. The
Berkeley was boarded by a sea that broke in all the windows on the lower deck, while the boats
on the narrow gauge route were unable to make a landing at all for a while. The Berkeley
