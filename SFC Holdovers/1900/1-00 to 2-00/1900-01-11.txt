"It is understood that the Union Steam
ship Company, besides ceasing to serve
Herr Pott, the Transvaal Consul General
at Lourenzo Marquez, as his agent
has withdrawn its steamers from the
Delagoa Bay route. The Castle Company
has done the same, and made arrange
ments that will prevent any use at Dela
goa Bay of their, vessels for anti-British
purposes. Measures in the same direction
have been taken with regard to the Em
pressa Landing Company. Withdrawal of
the steamers of two British mail com
panies may. however, increase Great Brit
ain's difficulties by throwing the carry
ing trade' still more into the hands of
continental shippers and diverting busi
ness to America for handling by foreign
steamers from American ports."
The article concludes by again urginsr
the Government to endeavor to secure a

The following dls-patch. dated at Frere Camp, January 10. noon, has been

"A Transvaal telegram gives the enemy's loss at Ladysmith on Saturday

all points. Natives here assert that the Boer loss in One commando

be among the FreÂ« Staters, who were forced by the Transvaalers Into the
most dangerous places."
This curious dispatch is all the War Office has Issued to-night. It "makes

LONDON, Jan. 11.â The special corre

dispatch:
RENS.BURG, Tuesday, Jan. 9.â On Sun
day a squadron of the composite House
hold Cavalry reconnoitered the enemy's
extreme left flank and unmasked two
guns, disclosing an entirely new position.
There were no . casualties. To-day the
camp is quiet and the men are resting. .
More complete details of the disaster to
the Suffolks on Saturday show that when
two of his companies reached the summit
of the 'hill where the Boers lay. Colonel
Watson addressed the men and officers
and an advance was made with fixed
bayonets. The Boers, who were hidden
in entrenchments, reserved their fire ' till
our men were within twenty yards, and
meanwhile crept round our force.
On Colonel Watson giving the order to
charge, he was immediately shot through
the head and the men were mown down
by a storm of bullets. Eventually they
were stopped by the stone breastworks of
the enemy, and here were surrounded and
compelled to surrender.
The other two companies retired without
casualties. The Boers behaved well. They
laid slain officers and men in separate
places, covering their faces with their
helmets and afterward . assisted in bury
ing them singing a psalm over their
graves. *
BOERS MAY SEIZE

LONDON, Jan. 11.â The Times, In a spe

entitled to , one-Quarter of his estate, and
that no stain rests on their baby heads, as
they were conceived and born in wedlock
sanctioned by the lawa of the common
wealth. â¢
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro's new battle line, it is
claimed, is backed by proofs of a missing
will. She says her attorneys will prove
that â¢ the deceased capitalist had named
Judge Wallace and I. W. Hellman execu.
tors of the Instrument: also that therein
Adolph Sutro made good his promise to
the city and gave to the municipality the
Cliff House, i the Sutro Heights and his
library.
Adolph Sutro's will offered for probate
has practically failed of its purpose
through the establishment therein of a
trust to convey beyond lives in being and,
in addition, it contains ambiguities in
divers provisions, which attempt to es
tablish- perpetuities for other than chari
table uses. Fearful, however, that the
Supreme Court will set aside the judg
ment of the lower court, sustain the will
and deprive her of the right to establish
heirahlp for herself and children under
the various provisions of the Code of
Civil Procedure. Mrs. Kluge-Sutro has de
cided to contest the document. Her long
association with the deceased resulted in
her thorough Â¦ acquaintanceship with his
acknowledged children and sisters, their
habits and family secrets.
Long ago, -Mrs. Kluge-Sutro will main
tain, they Joined their forces to contest
her claim for a division of the millions
their father left behind and she points to
this fact as evidence in support of her
allegation that undue influence was ex
ercised by them over the old man during
the last years of his life In the successful
effort to compel him to forget her, whose
children, she says, are his. and to neglect
them all In his last will and testament.

children, and Mrs. Emma Wlnterberg and
Mrs. Eliza Shucking, sisters, all heirs at
law of the deceased, stand ready to con
tribute to the defense of the estate and
to oppose her demands.
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro's first step toward the
acquirement of the share she believes to
be lawfully due her was taken In the Su
perior Court Octqber 25, 1898. On that date
she filed an application for letters of
guardianship over the persons and estates
of her children. In her petition she al
leged that hef children were those of the
late Adolph Sutro and that each was the
owner of an undivided. half of block 219.
Outside Lands, located In the heart of tha
Sutro tract. This land, Mrs. Kluge-Sutro
claimed, was conveyed to her children by
Mr. Sutro when with her they were liv
ing In a homo he had built for them at
Clay and Stelner streets. Circumstances
finally forced them to leave this home,
but all of the pretty furnishings were
moved before It was abandoned to 1319
Vallejo street, and there the little family
remained until recently, when it removed
to 2415 Buchanan street.
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro says that tha con
veyance of this land to her children,
backed by the many letters she received
from Sutro when she was abroad at hia
Instance, establishes her claims In toto,
and. even though the heirs of hla estate
n>ay fight her to the end on the matter
of the contract marriage, which she ay
leges was entered Into tn 1533, as aoon
as the death of Mr. Sutro's first wlfa
would permit, they cannot litigate lon*
In the face of the proofs she has In her
possession that her children are his, and
that he acknowledged them as such from
their infancy to the time of his death.
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro Is daily marshaling
witnesses and evidence, which she will
carry Into court to substantiate her claim.
For some months past negotiations -have
been pending between her. she says, and
Attorney McKlnstry. who represents the
heirs, looking toward a compromise. Tha
sum offered her, however, was Insuffi
cient, and the contest will be filed. Her
story of the relationship between herself
and Adolph Sutro will begin at their
meeting In his home at the Heights four
teen years aero, when as a girl, seeking
means of livelihood, she entered his homd
as a seamstress.
Mr. Sutro quarreled with his wife, but
the claimant remained there and ever aft
erward, until his death, she was hla com
oanion. Their life in a cottage at Paratso
Springs In the summer of I*9o will be fully
exploited, as will the fact that In due tlma
after returning to the city her first eb,ild.
Adolph Newton, was born. He was yet
a baby when the second child was born,
and there was a happy family In tha
pretty home the then aping man built
for it.
Since the death of Adolph Butrr>. how
ever, little content has been known by
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro. but she hopes that the
time Is not far distant when all will be
well. She has yet until the 20th of tha
month 4o file her contest before the stat
ute of limitations bars her. but in order
to be well in time she has Instructed her
attorneys to wait not later than Friday
before firing the second shot in her bat
tle for her honor, a fortune and tha good
name of her children.
The specific allegation will be made chat
the millionaire of the Heights and tha
then Miss Kluge were united In marriage>
by contract In December. 1593. and
the contract was duly witnessed. Wit
nesses. It Is stated, are at hand to testify
how Sutro told of this contract marriage
and pronounced It a record of the noblest
deed of his life.
While Mrs. Sutro's attorneys are getting
ready to do battle for her. and the claim
Is made that she refused a fortune In
compromise of her claim, the little woman

SOUTH AFRICA
How There Is a Promise of a
Lively Shake-Up Among
the Many British Gen
erals, Methuen Being One
of the First to Be. Re
lieved.
LONDON, Jan. 11.â The
chief item of news this
morning is that Generals
Roberts and Kitchener have,
reached Cape Town. Until the
Hew comander-in-chief has for
mulated a new plan of campaign
and a new system of tactics, and
until substantial reinforcements
arrive, news is likely to' be con
spicuous by its absence, as it is
not expected that any great
progress will be made.
British generals are at a stand
still because of faulty strategy
and because the forces on the
spot are inadequate, and neither
defect can be remedied at once.
Fuller details of the disaster to
the Suffolk regiment do not im
prove the original story. We
now hear nothing of the enemy
giving the order to retire. The
men seem to have been led up
against a strong Boer position
and to have been unable to
effect anything in the face of a
heavy fire, whereupon two com
panies retreated and a third was
captured. Again it is the same
story as Stonr.berg and Magers
fontein.
It is not likely that any great
move will be made on the British
fide until Lord Roberts has ccn
sidered the whole position and
given the generals under him in
structions.
General Buller might, if his
preparations had been complete,
have attacked on Saturday,
when Ladysmith was assailed, or
on the following Sunday, with
out giving any ground for the
suggestion that he wished to
bring off a coup before the ar-

without leaving himself open to
that imputation.
A report was current in the
city yesterday that General Hec
tor Macdonald, when he arrives,
will take over the command of
the Modder River column, re
lieving General Methuen, who,
it is said, has had serious disa-
and it is said. that the colonel of

and General Methuen disagreed
as to the advisability of a certain

Lord Roberts finds 120,000
men on the defensive or watch
ing for an opening. There is
certainly plenty of rank in evi
dence in South Africa. In addi
tion to the field marshal there
are two full generals, four
lieutenant generals and* twelve or
fourteen major generals. There
is an uneasy suspicion that when
the Ladysmith casualties are an
nounced they will be dishearten
ing and will partly destroy the
patriotic glow produced by Gen
eral White's "victory."
The list of victims of disease
issued by the War Office gives
twenty-two deaths from en

Ladysmith in four days, reveal

and facts?"
The Times in an editorial criti

made and demands that the
"practice of the non-revelation

New York Aristocrats
Cheer England.
NEW YORK, Jan. 10.â The annual re
union of the Albany Society of New York
was held to-night at Delmonico's. One
hundred and fifty persons were present.
Justice Woodward of the Supreme Court,
a particular friend of Governor Roose
velt; was down, to respond to the toast
"The Dutch in Albany and in South Af
rica." He devoted- the first part of his
address to the Dutch In Albany and then
turned to the Dutch in South Africa. As
he continued the guests began to cough
and laugh and in other ways annoy the
speaker. When he praised the Boers there
was an open outbreak of hostilities. Jus
, tice Woodward was unable to proceed.
One of the guests, who called himself.
i "Yours truly, John Smith," jumped on his
chair and shouted for order.
"The action of some of the members of
this society and their treatment of. Jus
Â¦ tice Woodward is utterly contemptible,"
he exclaimed. "Justice Woodward is here
to speak at the invitation of the society
and his subject was agreed upon. If you
are gentlemen you will act as such; if
not, then you ought to be ashamed of
Â¦yourselves."
He sat down, his face flushed with
anger, while a minority cheered and the
others hissed.
Justice .Woodward made an ineffectual
effort to - proceed with his paper, but
skipped whole pages. Ho finally said:
"I want to apologize ioyou for accept
ing your invitation to speak here to
night. It was understood that I was to
be your guest and to speak on the sub
ject-I have talked on and to read my ad
dress. 1 seem to have given you offense,
and I sincerely apologize to you,"
Then drawing himself to his full height
he thundered:
"In closing I want to propose a toast to
that grand old statesman, the â¢Wiliam
the. Silent, of South Africa, one of the
most Impressive personalities alive, old
Oom.Paul Kruger."
There were a few cheers, but Kruger's
name was drowned in an avalanche of
hisses. â¢
v Somebody stole up to the orchestra loft
and whispered Instructions to the leader,
and as Justice Woodward took his seat
the orchestra broke out with ''Tommy
Atkins." This made the sympathizers of
the British cheer wildly, while the pro-
Boer element in turn did some hissing.
ATTEMPT TO KILL
SIX JAPANESE
White Men Object to
Their Employment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 10.â A special
from L*avenworth, Okanogan County,
says that at about 11 o'clock Monday
night a dastardly attempt waÂ« made to
murder six Japanese recently sent there
to work for the Great Northern Railroad.
People residing near the. coal chutes In
the western part of town have- been ex
nectlnK trouble, as threats were made
that "ne Japanese would be fixed before
th^ week was over. At the hour men
tioned a terrific explosion was , heard.
People were awakened by the noise o( the
explosion, which was heard a mile away.
Tho "c in the neighborhood rushed to the
scene, expecting to nnd the mangled and
'Tho^Japlnfse^ui.i-e^a building 30x20
teet near the coal chute. An examination
thowed that the front of the I structure
Sad been blown away and the sides near
the center and rear were bulged out to
such In extent that the building will have
to be torn down. The rear part was used
a, a sleeping apartment, there being two
beds In the room. The front part was
Sstd as a kitchen. Dynamite was the
explosive employed, a large h Â° le ' n
crcund giving evidence of the fact. The
Japanese lost all their furniture cons st
ing of a cook stove, chairs and tables,
lifree of the men were asleep at the time
and were thrown out of bed by the force
of the. cxploeipn. All three were badly
Injured by the shock and flying^ glass.
The other three Japanese were. at work:
at the time and these escaped.
It is believed the outrage was commit
ted by railroad men, who are strenuously
opposed to the action of both the Great
Northern and the Northern Pacific roads
in employing a large number of Japanese
as section men and coal shovelers. i^ast
year when white labor was scarce hun
dreds of Asiatics were employed by all
the northwestern railroads and distrib

and Montana. There have been loud mut
terings on the part of the white men,
particularly as each steamer arriving
from Japan unloads from fifty to two
hundred more Japanese laborers at Puget
Sound and British Columbia ports, whence
they soon find railroad employment. There
has been a demand for all the white
workmen â¢ available, however. and.unUl

SECRETARY GAGE
GIVES HIS REPLY
Congress Gets Desired
Information.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â Secretary
Gage to-day sent to Congress his reply
to resolutions recently introduced In the
Senate by Allen, and in the- House, by
Sulzer of New York. The text of hi.s
reply, which is an exhaustive exposition
of the management of that branch of the
treasury finances under his adminstra
tion relating to national bank deposito
ries, contains about 9000 words, whiclr is
supplemented by special reports from de
partment oftkials relative to special' In
quiries in the resolution, including .copies
of over 1000 letters on the subject under
consideration. In summing up nis re
ply to the inquiries the Secretary, says.
Flrst-The reason tor utilizing national banks
as depositories for public moneys, as autnor
ized by law when the- receipts of the treasury
were exceeding its expenditures, h* 3 .? 6 !; 11 . Jr.
avoid the disturbance to business whlcn me
withdrawal of large sums of money from aetrve
circulation to the treasury vaults must inev
itably cause. Tha policy thus pursued by me
has been the established policy of the Govern
ment for many years, and a departure from it
under similar conditions would ceftainly cause
disastrous results.
Secondâ The reason for directing the internal
revenue receipts into depository banks at this
time is that the revenues are now largely.ex
ceeding the disbursements from month to month
and seem likely to do so for an Indefinite time.
This condition would be a menace to the busi
ness world, if assurance were not civen that
this surplus would he diverted from the treas
ury vaults to public depositories, where, while
secure to the Government. It would remain
available to the business world.
Thirdâ The reason for directing all the Inter
nal revenue receipts to one depository tvas that
It was more convenient to collect the receipts
of one office In one place and to make the de
sired distribution from it than to give Instruc
tions dally to 113 collectors. The most conve
nient agency to effect such distribution Is a
bank which is a member of the New York
Clf arlns-house. . . . --
Fourthâ The reason for selecting the National
City liank as such distributing agent was that
at the time the order was Issued it -was one
of the two banks which had offered bonds suf
ficient to cover the amount of the daily deposit.
Its bond deposit was $4,('<W.PC'O. and that of the
Hanover National Bank 11. 955,000. The National
City Bank was, therefore, jne one most natur
ally chosen. Of the sixty-eight banks applying
for a share of the deposits the National City
Bank, the Hanover National Bar.k and three
others, applicants for over JSOO.OOO each, are the
only ones out of the sixty-eight constituting
group one which have not been supplied the
full amount for which they had offered secur
ity.
Fifthâ The Custom House property wai sold
to the National City Bank as to the highest
bidder on July 3, 1899. Under the terms of the
sale It hal the option of paying in cash all
of the purchase money at any time, or any
part it might elect above JTSO.POO, which sum
it was absolutely obliged to pay. It exercised
this option by choosing to pay J3.215.fXi0, leav
ing JOO.ono yet due. No deed will be executed
until full payment has been made.
The rayment received was turned Into the
treasury by deposit in the National City Bank,
it having been the established custom of treas
ury officials, under the counsel of their legal
advisers, supported by decisions of the Supreme
Court, to consider moneys on deposit to the
credit of the treasurer of the United States
In dfsisnated depositories as moneys in the
treasury. This deposit was made In a de
pository bank for the same reason that other
deposits have been made In them, viz. : be
cause to Â¦withdraw the currency Into the vaults
of the treasury, where* it was not needed and
could not be utilized, would have required a
withdrawal of credit that was being expended
In commercial circles, and to that end a dis
turbance to the natural order of bug;ness would
have followed. To have required its payment
by the National City Bank to another desig
nated depository would have been an ungra
cious discrimination without substantially
changing the fact.
Finally, under my administration of the
Treasury department, no discrimination In
favor of one bank against another has been
niade. Generally speaking, when an Increase
In depository hanks warn desired all have been
Invited to qualify themselves for receiving
such money, and have be^n equally and equit
ably considered in their respective relations
to the treasury.

EL. PASO. Tex., Jan. 10.â Advices from
White Oaks, N. M.. in the Sacramento
Mountains, 150 miles northeast of El Paso,
at the terminus of the El Paso and North
eastern Railway, say that section was
swept by a blizzard yesterday, the effect
of which was disastrous. Many thou
sands of hoad of stock were frozen stiff
and two men were caught in the snow
storm and overcome. One was dead when
found to-day, but the other revived and
may recover. Al Haney was found dead
this morning near Nogales. He and a
companion started to walk- from Nogales
to White Oaks, when they were over
taken by the storm. Haney lay down In
the deep snow by the roadside and per-
Jshed. His companion succeeded in
reaching a house a mile distant.
A mall carrier was Also found this
morning near Oaks In a dying condition,
but he afterward slightly revived and
may recover. The storm is said to be the
worst ever experienced In that locality.
Many other casualties are reported, but
it is impossible to get details.
WORK DELATED
ON SANTA FE
The Three-Mile Tunnel
Proves a Failure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10.â According to
information at the Santa Fe headquarters
the bigg<Â£t cave-in that has been record
ed in years In railroad construction, has
occurred in the three-mile tunnel tho
Santa Fe is constructing on its way to
Point Richmond, whence bargee will
transport traffic i across the bay to San
Francisco. The barrier the road is en
countering is a range of mountains that
engineers, after vainly trying to solve tho
problem of uscent, decided must be tun
neled. . -'â¢.' r
The entire energy of the construction
department was marshaled at this point.
Before the engineers could strengthen the
tunnel the debris slid in owing to a soft
formation that was encountered. â¢
Among local Santa Ke officials doubt is
expressed as to the course the engineers
will now pursue to reach the point.-. Jt Is
probable, however, work will be contin
ued on the tunnel. The extent of the
cave-in has caused a temporary pause,
and sixty days. It is now given out, will
be consumed before the gTeat bore can be
cleared. Â»i :i Â¦ -^ Â¦

WAR OPERATIONS
SOOTH OF MANILA
Filipinos Retreat Before
Our Troops.
MANILA, Jan. 10.â Reports from the
movements of the American commanders
south of Manila show that General Bates
a'nd General Wheaton are at Perez das
Marinas and General Schwan at Silang,
nil awaiting the arrival of provision wag
ons. Reconnaissances have shown that
2000 armed insurgent* have retired to the
mountains from the district between In
dang and Maig. and that others have re
treated along the coast from Novelita to
ward Batangas.
Last night Nolan's squadron of the
Eleventh Cavalry drove a body of insur
gents from Maig. One American was
killed and two were wounded. Thirteen
dead Filipinos were found.
The movement largely resembles Gen
eral Schwan's experience in the same
country, except that the towns are now
being garrisoned and that the insurgents
refuse to fight, retreating southward and
dividing into small bands, with the ap
parent intention of reassembling later.
The plan of catching a large number be
tween two brigades has failed. About a
hundred insurgents have been killed, but
comparatively few arms have been taken.
The region is full of amigos, who doubt
less have been bearing arms, which they
have hidden. The women and children
remain in their homes, and the insur
gents, as they fall back, release all pris
oners they have captured.
It is asserted on high authority that
Archbishop Nozaleda contends In his in
terviews with Monsignor Chapelle, the
Papal delegate on behalf of the Roman
Catholic and the brotherhoods, that the
titles to all property held by the church
and the brotherhoods in the Philippines
should be recognized: that the Roman
catechism Bhould be taught In the pri
mary schools: that the existing religious
orders should continue to administer the
parishes; that other parishes should be
established under the same control, and
that the parochial control of cemeteries
should continue.
He lays stress in his contentions upon
the importance of allowing the church
to administer its own affairs without
state interference; upon the necessity of
a regime that will guarantee the liberty
of the church: upon the desirability of
European clergy, the establishment of a
new college for the instruction of native
priests and the continuation of indirect
contributions for the maintenance of
churches and clergy,' and upon tne expe
diency of maintaining the system of pa
rochial fees, including revenues from
births, marriages, funerals, dispensations
and apostolic indulgences.
In addition. Archbishop Nozaleda ad
vises the continuation of the church's
control of pawn shops and certain desig
nated hospitals and Bchools, together
with the establishment of a special form
of parochial administration exacted by
the actual conditions In the Philippines.
Finally, he makes a plea for the continua
tion of the present missionary work of
the church.
The inhabitants of the islands of L'eyU
and Samar are suffering from lack of
food, resulting from the long blockade,
the arbitrary confiscation of property and
the levying of .tribute by the so-c>.lled
government of the Filipinos. The gov
ernors of both islands are Tagalos who
were appointed by Aguinaldo, and they
hold tho territory completely in their
power, administering local affairs ac
cording to their own whims and account
able to no one. They have armed forces
which terrorize the peaceful Inhabitants.
The rebel forces, on the other hand,
havo never lacked food or money. The
Inhabitants, driven to desperation by the
necessity for having to pay four times
the normal .price for food stuffs, organ
ized against Insurgent depredations. Tbut.
having no arms, they were unable to re
sist their oppressors.

RELEASE OF THE
AMERICAN FLOUR
Food Stuffs Not Considered Contraband of
War Unless Intended for the .
Enemy.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â Senator Hale of Maine to-day offered the fol
lowing resolution regarding the alleged seizure of American flour by the
British Government:
Whereas, The property of citizens of the United States not
contraband of war has been lately seized by the military authorities
of Great Britain near Delagoa Bay, South Africa, without good y
reason for the same and contrary to the accepted principles of in
ternational law; and, whereas, said property is now . unjustly de
tained by the military authorities of Great Britain in disregard of
the rights of owners of the sama. Therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the United States, That the Secre
tary of State is requested to send to the Senate all information ir
possession of the State Department relating to said seizure and
detention and also to inform the Senate what steps have been taken
in requesting the restoration of property taken and detained as
aforesaid, and whether or not the Department has informed the
proper British authorities that if said detention is persisted in such
act will be considered as without warrant and offensive to the Gov
ernment and people of the United States.
LONDON, Jan. 10.â The American
flour seized off Delagoa Bay has
been released. United States Em
bassador Choate had an interview
with the Marquis of Salisbury this
afternoon, and received a verbal re
ply to the representations' of the Wash
ington Government.
The British note on this subject was
sent later to the United 3tates Embassy.
The gist of It was cabled to Washing
ton. In brief, food stuffs are not consid
ered contraband of war unless intended
for the enemy.
The Foreign Office only arrived at a
decision to-ds-- and it was not .until af
ter Mr. Choate's interview with the Mar
quis of Salisbury that a note embodying
the provisisons was drawn up. Several
of the Government's advisers wanted to
make a regulation regarding canned
goods, but this was decided to be im
practicable. The decision to make flour
and grain in transit to -the enemy con
traband is evidently hedged in by many
difficulties of execution, out the Foreign
Office believes .hat investigation will
generally determine whether the grain is
meant for consumption at Lourenzo
Marquez or in the Transvaal.
Mr. Choate cabled Lord' Salisbury's note
to the State Department at Washington
to-night, and Colonel Hay is expected to
reply, accepting the terms. The latter
step was not taken by Mr. Choate, as he
had first to receive authority from the
State Department to do so.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â Up to the
close of office hours the answer of the
British Government to Mr. Choate's rep
resentations as to the seizure of American
flour and other goods had not been re
ceived ?it the State Department. Nor has
Mr. Choate yet indicated when an an
swer may be expected,. and the State De
partment, basin? its Judgment on the fact
that it is still at the Embassador's re
quest collecting and transmitting' to him
information relative to the character of
the goods needed for the full representa
tion of the case, scarcely expects an im
mediate answer. It would, of course, be
gratified at an early response, but the
feeling is that anything returned at this
moment must be a- partial answer, or
rather, a communication that is calcu
lated to throw the matter into the ar
gumentative stage.

THE ' SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JAXUABY 11, 1900.
JULIA MORRISON
FOUND NOT GUILTY
The Slayer of flctor Leider>heimer
MaKes a Dramatic Speech
in Court
CHATTANOOGA. Term., Jan. 10.â The trial of Julia Morrison James for

of which they wrre leading man and lady, on the stage of the Chattanooga
OpTii-hnuse on the night of September 23, ended at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
wh< " wfxor one ballot, the jury returned a verdict of "not guilty."
Miss Morrison on hearing the words which insured her freedom ad
vanced to the speaker's platform and made a mort dramatic speech to the
court' and jory- Â«he Balfl;- - â¢-'.
"I wish to thank you and the gentlemen of the jury and all who were
lnatrumrn'.al in my acquittal for your just and generous decision. May God
in his mercy be ever as just to you and yours as you have been to me'to-day.
As to the prosecution. I wish to say that 1 fully forgive them and bear them
no malice for their strenuous efforts for my conviction.
â¢As fj my persecutors," she continued, turning toward. Mrs. George J.

When Miss Morrison had finished her speech, which 6he had rendered In a
dramatic style. Attorney Donaldson made a demand that she be held for carry

SIR CHARLES DILKE'S
UNPLEASANT CRITICISMS
LONDON. Jan. 10.â Sir Charles Dilke.
member of Parliament for the Forest of
3 'â¢ an, Division of Gloucestershire, speak
fng at Cmderfnrd to-night, said that A. J.
3va I four, the Government leader in the
3! u^f <<f Commons, had asserted that a

thi^ Government, considering the knowl
Â« .::.â¢ piss<-ssed at th<">- time, but had ad
mitted a full knowledge of. the Boer arm
nnv?ntÃ. Â¦"Â¦.â¢_::
Sir Charles declared that he was pre
parefi to ask In the House of Commons
whether the Government had taken suiH
c:.-:u stepsâ "the right steps in the mili
tary situation with due regard to the
tacts known at the time.
"The language Lord Salisbury employed
In Parliament." he continued, "constitut
ed an unnecessary menace â the very
thing which Mr. Balfour said it was a
Government'! .'lrst duty to abstain fromâ
End make war probable. More than this
the Government is responsible fo&the fact
that at the outset of the war we were
vith'uit guns enough for one army corps."
61r Charles criticized the Governments
refusal of capable Colonial troops, qual
ified to ride and shoot, and their accep
tance instead of these of 10.000 Imperial
yeomanry. Of the latter he said it had
l>fen alleged that they were neither good
horsemen nor good shots. In his own
opinion, the yeomanry probably rode well
enough, but there was very grave doubt
as to the shooting capabilities of a large
percentage.

men parading in the villages and singina
the Transvaal volkslcid. while the chil

VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 10.â So con
tagious is the enthusiasm here about en
listment with the British forces in South
Africa that the Japanese of this city arÂ©
not only willing but anxious to see service
on the British side in the Transvaal. They
have been organized by an ex-Japanese
officer. Japanese Consul Shimu has made
a formal tender of the services of this
Japanese corps to the British Government.
Numbers of letters have been received by
Mayor Garden of Vancouver from Ameri
cans in various Pacific Coast cities desir

NATIVES WITH BRITONS.
LONDON. Jan. 11.â The Cape Town cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle, tele
graphing Monday, says:
"The Uoers assert that eighty natives
fought on the side of the British at Kuru
man. They say their object in capturing
the place was to open the way for a com
mando to go south into the Prieska and
Konhardt districts, where the Boers hope
to foment rebellion. It is reported that
the Boer leaders allow every burgher to

spite of the groFsuess of the satire, it did
not have the obscene character* which
would justify the charge.

interest in all Africa, was named in honor
of the wife of Sir Harry Smith, who first
met her. at the capture of Badajos, in the
Peninsular campaign. She later became his
wife and accompanied him wherever he
went. â¢ i

CERTAIN DEFEAT FOR
THE FRENCH TREATY
Finds Too Strong Opposition Both in
the Paris Chambers and at
Washington.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. 10â Private re
ports reaching the diplomatic circle here
from P.iris indicate that the reciprocity
treaty between the United States and
France is in a hazardous position, with
more than the possibility of defeat when
it cones to the final vote In the French
Chambers.
The administration here Is filled with
prave concern for the fate of the treaty
la thÂ»Â» T'nitrd Ptat^s Senate, and thus the
convention is In the singular position of
3>f'.njr exposr-d to rejection by both parties
on the ground that it is too favorable to
each.
BEET CROP SUFFERS.
Social Dlepstrh to Tbe Call.
MONTEREY. Jan. 10.â News comes
here from those portions of Monterey
County that suffered most from the re
cent overflow of the Salinas River that
the damage to crops from the flood is
not nearly so great as was at first fear'd.
Atfr the dam at the river's mouth,
rat'sed by the combination of debris
brought down with the increaff-d current,
and the sandbar, had broken the waters
tsubpldf-d rapidly and the Inundated farm
lands were quickly relieved. The clear
tvf-ather of thf past few days has en
rblÂ«*d the pround to dry sufficiently to
Allow ranchmen to harvest their beets,
and it is now stated that at least two
thirds of the crop remain uninjured. The
other third is Â« total loss, as the beets
are beginning to rot. Between 900 and 1000
acre* of beets were under water during
the overflow, and It is believed that had
the dam not broken when it did the en
tire acreage would have been ruined, in
volving a loss of about $15,000.

Once or twice a year the good house-

house has been swept and dusted every
day in the year, but the housewife knows
that in spite of vigilance dust accumu-
lates in cracks and corners, and is only
to be removed by special effort.
It's the same way with the body. You
look after it every day. You take all
the ordinary precautions of cleanliness

special cleaning to rid jt of the accumu-

Yesterday the Shepherds noticed with
surprise the arrival of a five-gallon can
of coal oil and a sack of coal for Boyle.
Gas was used exclusively in the saloon,
and Boyle was not in the habit of pur
chasing any but a very small quantity of
kerosene at a tim<\ At X o'clock he gave
his barkeeper, James O'Brien. 50 cents to
get a bed outside with. Ip to that time
O'Brien had occupied a bed in the back
loom with Boyle. From 10 o'clock to the
time when she Ilrst hoard the tlamcs Mrs.
Shenh*>rd was k.-pt awake by the splitting
of kindling ar.d various "noises which
Boyle made in building the bonfire which
was to have burned the flats to the
ground.
"When arrested Boyle had on his over
coat, and in an outhouse the firemen
found a valise ready packed with all his
clothes. When taxed with the crime
Boyle only ejaculated. "Prove it!" It was
stated that Boyle was intoxicated at the
time of his arrest, but when peon to-day
he indignantly denied it. He claims that
he "came in from somewhere" and dis
covered the flames, but when asked where
h<Â» had been anrt who had split the chairs
up he relapred into silence.
The. preliminary he&.rini< is set for next
Wednesday. Boyle is held on $2000 bonds,
and up to late this afternoon had failed
to secure them.
O'Malley. with whom Boyle had the
trouble and whom he attempted to avenge
himself Â¦ on. Is a wealthy land owner and
superintendent of the water company.
Boyle has a very bad record, and a few
nights ago was thrown out of Kelly's
stable by Foreman Mclaughlin, who lirst
notified the Fire Department of this morn
ing's blaz*.
heeling in the town runs very high over
Boyle's act, and there was talk this morn
ing among the rougher element of lynch
ing. Late this afternoon Attorney Joseph
Murray, acting in the interest of O'Mal
lejr. levied an attachment of $23 50 on
Boyle's property for back rent.
We want 1900 to be a very successful year with usâ we want more people to get acquainted with us.
So we start the year with a remarkable saleâ tailor-made suits and overcoats in eight different styles of gar-
mentsâany one you may select, $13.50.
We have been planning this sale for monthsâ bought the material before the prices of cloth went up.
The sale is for a limited time onlyâ until all the cloth of this lot is gone. After that it is doubtful if you
can ever get such values in tailor-made clothesâ especially if the price of cloth keeps up.
With cloth having advanced per cent in some instances, think what a value you are getting in goods
bought before the raise and sold to you at prices very much less than they were formerly.

MYSTERIOUS RAILWAY
CONSTRUCTION IN IDAHO
New Road That, It Is Believed, Will
Form Part of the Vanderbilt
System.
MINNEAPOLIS. Jan. 10.â A special
from Lewlston, Idaho, says: "The Pacific
and Idaho Northern Railway, now being
built from Welser, in the southern part
of the State, north to Seven Devils, is the
most mysterious piece of railroad build
ing in the country. It begins nowhere
and ends nowhere. Yet over 100 miles of
the finest roadbed have been built and
cash is paid for everything and only the
best material is purchased. No one knows
who Is furnishing the cash or why the
road ia being built. It is believed, how
ever, to be the Vanderbilt connecting link
between the East and West.
"The Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company Is to build seventy-seven miles
from Riparia to Lewiston, and eventually
this piece of road will connect the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company with
the Oregon Short Line. This will make It
possible to start a car at New York City
and pull it to Portland, Or., on tracks
owned by tho Vanderbllts. The new road
will come down the Salmon to the Snake,
and then to Lowlston. Then the Vander
bilt system will have water grades
through the mountains and to the sea."

GERMAN LINER
SLIPS INTO OCEAN
Deutschland Launched
at Vulcan Yards.
STETTIN. Jan. 10.â The Hamburg-
American line steamer Deutschland was
successfully launched at the Vulcan dock
yard to-day in the presence of Emperor
William and many notable people. The
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count yon
Bulow. christened the vessel. In his
speech Count yon Bulow dwelt on the
powerful development of the Hamburg-
American line, which, he said, with the
North-German Lloyd had during half a
century grown to be the greatest ship
ping company in the world. The new
ship to-day added to their fleet, he added.
was to run on that high road of North
Atlantic traffic which connected with Ger
many a friendly nationâ the United
States. The ship had been built at the
Vulcan dock yard, which began Its career
in as modest a way as the hamburg-
Amerlcan line and now provides foreign
navies with every type of ship. The
Deutschland was intended to be the most
powerful ship In the world and to surpass
in speed all vessels afloat.
Germany's present transoceanic policy
and world policy necessarily resulted from
her economic growth. Germany felt more
and more that a nation which allowed
Itself to be pushed from the sea would
stand aloof from the busy life of the
Â¦world. Germany, which long had ceased
to be an inland* country in the heart of
Europe and which had also become com
mercially a world power in the front rank
of rivalry, must also be strong enough on
the sea to guarantee everywhere German
peace, German honor and German pros
perity.
After breaking a bottle of champagne
across the steamer's bows Count yon Bu
low said: "God bless and protect this
ship. Protect the friendship and com
merce between us and the United States."
The Minister then called for cheer 3 for
the "leader of the nation â the Emperor."
WHITESIDE YET
ON THE STAND
Clark's Counsel Will Try
to Impeach Him.
?
> WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
held only one session in its hearing of the
Clark Senatorial election case to-day. Ex-
State Senator Whlteside of Montana wa?
the only witness. It was the fourth day
of the examination.
When the committee adjourned at noon
Faulkner announced that he had for the
present concluded the cross-examination
of Whiteside, but that he would ask for
his recall later in order to propound cer
tain questions which he was not yet ready
to put and upon which he would under
take to impeach his testimony. Campbell,
representing the anti-Clark petitioners,
said that he wished to ask a few more
questions en re-direct examination, and
on this account it is expected that White
side will be on the etand when the hear
ir.* is resumed to-morrow.
Ex-Senator Faulkner's efforts to-day
were directed toward entagling White
side upon dates and : exact statements
made as to the transactions in connection
with Clark's election to the Senate, and
he went fully into the deposit of money
by him. Faulkner brought out the fact
that of the men to whom the â¢witness
knew cf his own personal knowledge
money had been paid, only two had sub
sequently voted for Ciark, and that there
was no clear understanding as to the full
transaction with those two.
Whitetlde closed with the renewal cf
his declaration that he believed himself
to be serving the State of Montana in his
present course and a review of the use
of money in State affairs which had in
cited him to it.

WINNERS A
MOTLEY LOT
Jockey Bill at J5O to J, and
, Lomo, a 40 to J Shot,
Among; Them.
Jockey Bill, a five-year-old gelding
named after Willie Martin, the noted
rider, captured the last race on the card
at Tanforan yesterday, with the enor
mous price of 250 to 1 laid against him In a
couple of the books. The prevailing odds
though were 150 to 1, and quite a number
of sheets were spoiled by the block man
accepting small wagers on the outsider.
Ridden by Kiley, he alternated with
Clarando in cutting out the pace, finally
beating out Caesar Young's horse a
length. Glissando, the favorite, was cut
down and old Libertine pulled up on three
legs.
11l luck trailed the favorites from the
outset, Grand Sachem being the only
choice to earn a pair of brackets. One
dollar parleyed on the six winners would
have netted the fortunate investor Jj.o*".

A widely circulated tip on Wild Het to
win the rirst event proved a good one.
The mare, with Nate Hill in the saddle,
was quoted at S to 1, and. in front from
the start, breasted the tape a length
ahead of March Seven. Charles Le Bel,
equal favorite with Miss Soak, ran third.
A bad accident, in which Jockey Mat
tier, who rode Rossmore, was seriously
injured, marred the hurdle number. Lomo,
a 40 to 1 shot, won easily from Monita.
At the last jump, the favorite. Rio Cnico,
fell. On taking the fourth jump, Ross
more fell heavily on Mattier. anu he was
carried to the hospital in an almost un
conscious condition.
Ping was backed down to favoritism to
annex the third purse at a mile. Leading
for half the distance he tired, finishing
third. Merry Boy drew away from the
bunch In the stretch, winning in a gallop
from White Fern.
Two Montana-bred horses fought it out
in the six furlong sprint following. Cro
ker, on which there was a very heavy
play, went out in the .lead with a fine
showing of speed, but could not stay, fall
ing easy prey to the favorite. Grand Sa
chem, nicely ridden by T. Walsh.
The smart ones fell heavily over the de
feat of Timemaker in the six furlong purse
run, fifth to be decided. The Schorr
sprinter received extensive backing at
odds of 7 to 5, even though asked to han
dle 120 pounds. Hooking up with St. Cuth
bert the pair breezed away at a heart
breaking clip to the stretch, where St.
Cuthbert snapped. Thorpe then came
along with Loving Cup and, ridden out,
the filly downed the favorite over a
length in 1:13^.

CHirAGO. Jan. 10.â An appeal to the ag
ricultural Interests of California In par

coalition of the growers .of sugar beets
and sugar cane and manufacturers of su

BAD BOY IS
BEATEN BY
ROYAL ANNE
Clever Running in Midweek
Reserve Stake at Union
Coursing Park.
Pasha kennels' blue greyhound Royal
Anne ran cleverly and truly yesterday at
Union Coursing Park, winning the mid
week stake. The daughter of Firm
Friend and Valley Queen is only in the
puppy class, but she ran like a champion,
allowing her six opponents to score only
two points against her. Lady Marion
scored one of these and McKinley the
other. Lady Davenport, Athena, Vanity
Fair and Bad Boy were retired pointless.
Bad Boy was Koyal Anne's opponent in
the final and the pair proved equally
matched. They ran stride for stride until
nearing the hare, when Koyal Anne drew
out and scored the first turn by a length.
She never relinquished this advantage un
til she killed.
The running throughout the day was
sharp and snappy, none of tha courses be
ing severÂ© on the dogs, while in some in
stances they ran up and killed quickly.
The most notable upset of the day was
the defeat of. Controller by Iron Duke.
The former led up by four lengths, and
when he pressed the hare it turned back
to Iron Duke. He was after it quickly
and scored a turn and killed before Con
troller was again on the gams.
Mocorita and Wait a Bit were so evenly
matched they ran two undecided courses
before the lormer finally won. The re
sults of the running, with the oilicial
scores, follow:

WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.â Beautiful and
impressive tributes were paid by the Sen

Early in the session Hale of Maine in
troduced a resolution of inquiry, address
ed to the Department of State, as to tha

ual interest because of its attitude to
ward Great Britain. It was not actea
upon.

"Have you become convinced that the

"Brutal? No. They are fakes. That
Is why I. think the Horton law should be
repealed. The flphts arc fixed before hand

for Instance, the McGovern-Dixon fight at

MYSTERIOUS RAILWAY
CONSTRUCTION IN IDAHO
New Road That, It Is Believed, Will
Form Part of the Vanderbilt
System.
MINNEAPOLIS. Jan. 10.â A special
from Lewlston, Idaho, says: "The Pacific
and Idaho Northern Railway, now being
built from Welser, in the southern part
of the State, north to Seven Devils, is the
most mysterious piece of railroad build
ing in the country. It begins nowhere
and ends nowhere. Yet over 100 miles of
the finest roadbed have been built and
cash is paid for everything and only the
best material is purchased. No one knows
who Is furnishing the cash or why the
road ia being built. It is believed, how
ever, to be the Vanderbilt connecting link
between the East and West.
"The Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company Is to build seventy-seven miles
from Riparia to Lewiston, and eventually
this piece of road will connect the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company with
the Oregon Short Line. This will make It
possible to start a car at New York City
and pull it to Portland, Or., on tracks
owned by tho Vanderbllts. The new road
will come down the Salmon to the Snake,
and then to Lowlston. Then the Vander
bilt system will have water grades
through the mountains and to the sea."

GERMAN LINER
SLIPS INTO OCEAN
Deutschland Launched
at Vulcan Yards.
STETTIN. Jan. 10.â The Hamburg-
American line steamer Deutschland was
successfully launched at the Vulcan dock
yard to-day in the presence of Emperor
William and many notable people. The
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count yon
Bulow. christened the vessel. In his
speech Count yon Bulow dwelt on the
powerful development of the Hamburg-
American line, which, he said, with the
North-German Lloyd had during half a
century grown to be the greatest ship
ping company in the world. The new
ship to-day added to their fleet, he added.
was to run on that high road of North
Atlantic traffic which connected with Ger
many a friendly nationâ the United
States. The ship had been built at the
Vulcan dock yard, which began Its career
in as modest a way as the hamburg-
Amerlcan line and now provides foreign
navies with every type of ship. The
Deutschland was intended to be the most
powerful ship In the world and to surpass
in speed all vessels afloat.
Germany's present transoceanic policy
and world policy necessarily resulted from
her economic growth. Germany felt more
and more that a nation which allowed
Itself to be pushed from the sea would
stand aloof from the busy life of the
Â¦world. Germany, which long had ceased
to be an inland* country in the heart of
Europe and which had also become com
mercially a world power in the front rank
of rivalry, must also be strong enough on
the sea to guarantee everywhere German
peace, German honor and German pros
perity.
After breaking a bottle of champagne
across the steamer's bows Count yon Bu
low said: "God bless and protect this
ship. Protect the friendship and com
merce between us and the United States."
The Minister then called for cheer 3 for
the "leader of the nation â the Emperor."
WHITESIDE YET
ON THE STAND
Clark's Counsel Will Try
to Impeach Him.
?
> WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
held only one session in its hearing of the
Clark Senatorial election case to-day. Ex-
State Senator Whlteside of Montana wa?
the only witness. It was the fourth day
of the examination.
When the committee adjourned at noon
Faulkner announced that he had for the
present concluded the cross-examination
of Whiteside, but that he would ask for
his recall later in order to propound cer
tain questions which he was not yet ready
to put and upon which he would under
take to impeach his testimony. Campbell,
representing the anti-Clark petitioners,
said that he wished to ask a few more
questions en re-direct examination, and
on this account it is expected that White
side will be on the etand when the hear
ir.* is resumed to-morrow.
Ex-Senator Faulkner's efforts to-day
were directed toward entagling White
side upon dates and : exact statements
made as to the transactions in connection
with Clark's election to the Senate, and
he went fully into the deposit of money
by him. Faulkner brought out the fact
that of the men to whom the â¢witness
knew cf his own personal knowledge
money had been paid, only two had sub
sequently voted for Ciark, and that there
was no clear understanding as to the full
transaction with those two.
Whitetlde closed with the renewal cf
his declaration that he believed himself
to be serving the State of Montana in his
present course and a review of the use
of money in State affairs which had in
cited him to it.

Ridden by Kiley, he alternated with
Clarando in cutting out the pace, finally
beating out Caesar Young's horse a

down and old Libertine pulled up on three

ahead of March Seven. Charles Le Bel,
equal favorite with Miss Soak, ran third.
A bad accident, in which Jockey Mat
tier, who rode Rossmore, was seriously
injured, marred the hurdle number. Lomo,
a 40 to 1 shot, won easily from Monita.
At the last jump, the favorite. Rio Cnico,
fell. On taking the fourth jump, Ross
more fell heavily on Mattier. anu he was
carried to the hospital in an almost un
conscious condition.
Ping was backed down to favoritism to
annex the third purse at a mile. Leading
for half the distance he tired, finishing
third. Merry Boy drew away from the
bunch In the stretch, winning in a gallop
from White Fern.
Two Montana-bred horses fought it out
in the six furlong sprint following. Cro
ker, on which there was a very heavy
play, went out in the .lead with a fine
showing of speed, but could not stay, fall
ing easy prey to the favorite. Grand Sa
chem, nicely ridden by T. Walsh.
The smart ones fell heavily over the de
feat of Timemaker in the six furlong purse
run, fifth to be decided. The Schorr
sprinter received extensive backing at
odds of 7 to 5, even though asked to han
dle 120 pounds. Hooking up with St. Cuth
bert the pair breezed away at a heart
breaking clip to the stretch, where St.
Cuthbert snapped. Thorpe then came
along with Loving Cup and, ridden out,
the filly downed the favorite over a
length in 1:13^.

GROWERS ASKED
TO FIGHT TREATIES
Appeal of League of
Domestic Producers.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CHirAGO. Jan. 10.â An appeal to the ag
ricultural Interests of California In par
ticular and the Pacific Coast in general
has been prepared by the League of Do
mestic Producers. This organization is a
coalition of the growers .of sugar beets
and sugar cane and manufacturers of su
gar th*resrora; growers of tobacco and
cigar-makt-rs; producers of semi-tropic
and other fruits, vegetables, wool, cotton,
rice and riots. Its purpose is to defeat the
admission of produce from the tropics
or from South America at lower tariff
rates or f r< c cf all duties. The organiza
tion was effected at Omaha December S
and claims to have 6ir.ee affiliated with
it nearly all the associations of producers
ar.d manufacturers in the interests re
ferred to, embracing upward of three mil
lion voters. The statement issued to-day
is signed by Herbert Myrick, chairman of
the league, widely known among agricul
turists as the editor of the Orange Judd
Farmer, Chicago, and also the American
Agriculturist. New York. The document
follow,:

BAD BOY IS
BEATEN BY
ROYAL ANNE
Clever Running in Midweek
Reserve Stake at Union
Coursing Park.
Pasha kennels' blue greyhound Royal
Anne ran cleverly and truly yesterday at
Union Coursing Park, winning the mid
week stake. The daughter of Firm
Friend and Valley Queen is only in the
puppy class, but she ran like a champion,
allowing her six opponents to score only
two points against her. Lady Marion
scored one of these and McKinley the
other. Lady Davenport, Athena, Vanity
Fair and Bad Boy were retired pointless.
Bad Boy was Koyal Anne's opponent in
the final and the pair proved equally
matched. They ran stride for stride until
nearing the hare, when Koyal Anne drew
out and scored the first turn by a length.
She never relinquished this advantage un
til she killed.
The running throughout the day was
sharp and snappy, none of tha courses be
ing severÂ© on the dogs, while in some in
stances they ran up and killed quickly.
The most notable upset of the day was
the defeat of. Controller by Iron Duke.
The former led up by four lengths, and
when he pressed the hare it turned back
to Iron Duke. He was after it quickly
and scored a turn and killed before Con
troller was again on the gams.
Mocorita and Wait a Bit were so evenly
matched they ran two undecided courses
before the lormer finally won. The re
sults of the running, with the oilicial
scores, follow:

WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.â Beautiful and
impressive tributes were paid by the Sen
ate to-day to the memory of the late yica

relations with many Senators and h:a
close affiliation with all of them rendered
his death a distinct loss to every mem

try. It was in commemoration of n;a
public service and of his private charac
ter that the Senate set apart tha session
to-day for the pronouncement ol eulogioa
upon him. Personal friends and asso
ciates and party friends and party oppo
nents joined in paying such sincere and
eloquent tribute to the memory or Mr.
Hobart. to his character and public ser
vices, as have seldom been paid to any
public man.
Addresses were delivered by Senators
Sewell and Kean of New Jersey. Daniel
of Virginia. Depew of New York, Cock
rell of Missouri. Cullom of Illinois. Davis
of Minnesota, Morgan of Alabama,
Chandler of New Hampshire, Lodge or
Massachusetts. Caffery of Louisiana ana
Allen of Nebraska.
Early in the session Hale of Maine in
troduced a resolution of inquiry, address
ed to the Department of State, as to tha
seizure of American flour by the British;
authorities, which aroused more than us
ual interest because of its attitude to
ward Great Britain. It was not actea
upon.
Miscellaneous business of minor impor
tance occupied me attention of the House
to-day until 1 o'clock, after which aa
hour was devoted to eulogies upon tha
life and public services of the late Rep
resentative Greene of Nebraska. Tha

Legislature. They had not expected to
defeat the rules, but they confidently be
lieved the vote would be close. Ex-Con

Is said they are preparing to spring legal
objections to the manner ln which Goe

Miners Snowbound.
SEATTLE. Jan. 10. â Two hundred and
forty Klondlkers were snow barricaded
at Bennett last Friday when the steamer
Rosalie, which arrived to-night, sailed
from Skaguay. They were waiting Tor
a Skaguay train to get across to sait
water. Some of them had been there a
week, and the crowd was daiiy Increasing
by upriver additions from Dawson. From
Bennett to the capital of the Klondike the
ice trail has been in splendid condition
for more than a month, which started
people from the district by the score.
Chamber of Commerce Organized.
STOCKTON. Jan. 10.â The Stockton
Chamber of Commerce was organized to
night with an' active membership of fifty
business men. Mayor W. B. Harrison was
elected president. P. A. Buell. president
of the San Joaquin Valley Association,
was the chief promoter and" presided at
the temporary organization. The first ac
tion of the new body to-night was to pro
test against the spoliation of Calaveras
big treea.
Suicide of a Butcher.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 10.â Edwin Abel, a Mil
pitas butcher, aged 50 years, committed
suicide this evening by blowing the top
of his head off with a. rifle. The act was
committed ln a storeroom near the house.
The cause Is not known. Ha was a man

Special Jury Ordered.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 10.â Judge Dalnger
fleld granted the motion of the defend

Meek vs. Santa Rosa and others for an

actual value of the waterworks.
Neff Sent the Docu
ment.
The resignation of State Senator Law
rence J. Dwyer, a copy of which was re
cently published ln The Call, has been for
warded to Lieutenant Governor Neff and
by him transmitted to Governor Gage.
Mr. Dwyer resigned his State legislative
office in order to qualify as Supervisor of
the city and county of San Francisco.
Owing to the resignation, the Nineteenth
Senatorial District Is unrepresented in the
Senate of this State.
The constitution (article IV, section 12)
provides: "When vacancies occur in
either house, the Governor, or the per
son exercising the functions of the Gov
ernor, shall issue writs of election to fill
such vacancies."
The statute giving force to the consti
tutional provision requires that the Gov
ernor shall at once issue the writ of elec
tion.
It is presumed, therefore, that the chief
magistrate, having been officially advised
of the Dwyer vacancy, will not indefinite
ly postpone the issuance of the writ. Last
February he called a special election in
the Eighth Senatorial District to fill the
vacancy in the Senate caused by the
death of John Boggs. The point was then
raised that .the Legislature would be on
the eve of adjournment before Mr. Boggs'
successor could be chosen, but the Gov
ernor met this contention .with the argu
ment that he had no discretionary power
In the premises, as the law clearly made
It his duty to call the election at once.
The voters, and especially the Demo
cratic voters ln the Nineteenth Senatorial
District, would like to have another elec
tion this season and they are clearly en
titled to it under the constitution and the
law. Elections are about all the comforts
that the Democratic voters derive from
the government. It is true that they have
had already this season one primary elec
tion, one municipal election and two bond
elections, but they have not had anything
else. The patriots are, therefore, willing
to rally around the ballot box once more.
To test the sense of the voters in the
Nineteenth Senatorial District there ought
to be two Democratic candidates and two
Republican candidates for Senator. One
of the Democrats should be nominated on
a platform indorsing the local administra
tion of Mayor Phelan and one of the Re
publicans should be nominated on a plat
form indorsing the State administration
of Governor Gage. It would be interest-

COAST'S JOBBERS TO
BE HEARD IN MARCH
INTERSTATE COMMISSIONERS
NAME A DATE.
Preftnt Status Is Entirely Satis
factory to the Pacific Coast
Parties Interested.
March 15 has been finally fixed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission as the
date for the beginning of the hearing to
be held in San Francisco in the suit
brought by the St. Louis and other Middle
West jobbers against the transcontinental
railroads, to which the jobbers of the Pa
cific Coast became parties in Interest by
intervention. The fixing of a later date
for the hearing than was at one time
thought to be probable will not inconveni
ence the Interests of the Pacific Coast, as
existing conditions here are just what the
Jobbers and manufacturers of the coast
desire. They would be pleased to have
them continue Indefinitely. The supposi
tion is that the delay has b*?en occasioned
by the engagements of Commissioner
Knapp, who has promised to lecture be
fore some Eastern University.
On the day fixed by the commission to
begin taking testimony there will be gath
ered In San Francisco representatives of
all the commercial and manufacturing in
terests on the coast to testify against the
proposed abrogation of differentials be
tween the carload and less than carload
shipments, and also against the proposi
tion for graded rates from the Atlantic
seaboard westward to St. Louis. The case
is really ready for presentation on the
part of the Pacific Coast now and there
is abundant evidence. The testimony Is
at hand showing the Justice of the claims
of the coast.
In the interim before the hearing, ac
cording to information received here yes
terday, another matter of Interest to the
coast, because it has established a prece
dent concerning the less than carload dif
ferential, will come up for hearing in New
York. This is the change in the official
classification, which affected all roads and
all territory east of the Mississippi River
when it went into effect on the Ist day of
January.
The hearing has been brought abcrut
throueh the Merchants' Association of
New York. The parties to be represented
are the association named and the official
classification committee and the Trunk
Line Association. President William F.
King of the New York Merchants' Asso

ROOT NOT A CANDIDATE.
Secretary of War Does Not Want the
Vice Presidency.
MILWAUKEE. Jan. 10.â Henry C.
Payne, National Republican Committee
man of Wisconsin, to-day received a let
ter from Hon. Elihu Root, Secretary of
War, ln which Mr. Root states that he
will not be a candidate for the Vice Pres
idency of the United States. In the letter
Mr. Root states that he deems it far more
important to the country, the administra
tion and the Republican party at this crit
ical time of war that he should continue
to attend to the business of the War
Office, not that there are no other men
who could well discharge the duties of
Secretary of War, but, having spent five
or six months in becoming familiar with
the subject, no other man could step in
and take up the work without going
through the Â«ame training. Being a can
didate for Vice President would mean hia
practical withdrawal from the duties of
the War Office within a very short time.
TO DESTROY TRUSTS.
Butler Proposes Government Owner-
ship of Public Utilities.
WASHINGTON', Jan. 10.â Senator But

the Government to destroy trusts by re

The plan proposed is to control the is
suance of money and to control the rail
roads and telegraph and telephone lines
by the Government, when, the resolution
sets forth, "the three greatest trust 3 for
evil known to civilization will have been
destroyed and at the same time the

MAXWELL WILL
SUE TO RETAIN
HIS POSITION
There is a feeling of unrest among the
firemen of San Francisco, caused by the
realization of the fact that at present the
city is without a fire department, and has
been since the new charter went into ef
fect.
The reorganization Is not yet complete
and there have been virtually no changes
made in the make-up of the different ccm
pames. Before the appointment of the
new Commissioners, the firemen were
alone ln the scramble to retain their
places under the new order of things, but
now even the raen ln the buggies are wor
rying.
When the firemen received their instruc
tions for the primary and the municipal
elections to work hard for Phelan, it v/as
given out ln all the houses that ln re
turn for his Influence Sam Rainey's de
mand that the fire department should not
be disturbed was acceded to, and that the
Bush-street boss was to be "it," if Phe
lan carried away the Mayoralty plum.
Kainey certainly delivered the goods, so
far as votes were concerned, and after
election started h'.s list of what he con
sidered the best men to be retained ln the
new organization.
When the Fire Commissioners at first
opporturuty dropped George Maxwell.
Rainey realized that he had seen the cora
ner.ce.-nent of his finish. To Maxwell this
last nave was unexpected, though not
surprising as he had btren aware for some
time that Mayor Phelan had declared
himself in favor of J. C. Gorman.
Rainey met the Mayor's representative
in Maxwell's behalf and ante-election
promises were dragged forth, but to no
avail, a? the best Kainey could get was
that Maxwell's name was not mentioned
in the promise and that a man or two
would make no material difference.
When the Interview was over Rainey
realized that his list of firemen would
not pull through, and consequently hia
men must hustle for themselves.
Maxwell Intends to fight his case to the
bitter end. and will to-day, through his
attorney Garret McEnerney, apply for
a writ of mandate to compel the Com
missioners to reinstate him as secretary
and to recognize him as such.
Maxwell said last night to a Call re
porter that his suit was for the purpose
of protecting his own rights and deter
mining the standing of the men of the
department.
"The Commissioners, he said, are
as*uiil t ".g powers that are not vested in
them. They claim it their right to place
a man on the retention list, or the ac
tive llÂ«t as they deem best, and in my
case according to their way of thinking.
they can enlist me aÂ« an extraman or to
ar.y position they desire.
"I c'aim that when a man is .reinstated
it muÂ«t be to a position as high as that
occurred when dropped from the active
list The Commissioners had no right to
remove me. and if they are upheld In
their action it will upset the entire de
partment, and no man is secure in his
position. It makes the department a big
political machine, as the Commissioners
can if they desire, fill the department
with men who are politically of their
aÃumorÂ«a RumorÂ« of surprising changes ln the
department are thick, and top-notchers
as well as the firemen will be on the
anxious seat for som* time to come.
Ing of the differences between the carload
and less than carload rates. The changes
ln the official classification number over
.00, of which 230 are on hardware and iron
articles. Five of the latter are on car
loads and 235 are en less than carloads.
Of eighty-four advances in grocery arti
cles sixteen apply to carload shipments.
The remainder are on the less than car
load lots.
signing the forestry claim the claimant
is given scrip which he is at liberty to
place on 'public lands anywhere in the
United States. This scrip is transferable
to any one. Consequently it has been
sold, and there are parties in this city
who have been making a business of cov
ering supposed oil lands with the scrip
and getting reimbursement by taking a
half interest in the land for their pay.
Several mining oil companies have taken
the scrip and placed it on top of the min
eral filings they have made. They are
not especially concerned .in the outcome,
but others are looking on at the pro
ceeding now pending with considerable
interest.
The mineral locators have had two de
cisions that seemed to make it neces
sary for them to establish the existence
of oil in the lands they ha\-e taken up.
One of these was by the Department of
the Interior and the other by Judge Ros3
in a recent suit at Los Angeles.

smaller vote. There would not be the
slightest danger of the election of either

Governor Gage arrived in the city from
Sacramento yesterday. He admitted that
Senator Dwyer's resignation was received
at the executive office, but failed to ex
tend his thanks to The Call for Informing
him in advance that the resignation was
on the way to the capitol.
GAGE RECEIVES
RESIGNATION OF
SENATOR DWYER
POLITICALLY this is a cold world. Many seÂ« humor, ln misery, but few find sympathy for the
sorrowing. The pangs and heartaches of the "outs" find no re-echoing chord in the hearts of
the every-day man. while the glory and the glee of the "ins" seem to be contagious with
every one that has no desire to hold office and whose only satisfaction in having the electoral
franchise is to help the other fellow get a fat job.
Since the charter changes at the City Hall the big pile is fairly teeming with funny
things. Down in the basement, where the keepers of the peace hold forth, there is consternation
over the prospects of an order from Acting Chief of Police Biggy that every officer on the force
must appear every day with a clean collar. Mr. Blggy is interested in a laundry. Some people also
see something humorous in his order that Chinatown must be cleansed.
Phil Fay Jr.. secretary of the Park Commissioners, and Superintendent McLaren have taken
account of stock. They spent a day counting the shrubs and the grass plats in the city parks and
informing the gardeners and laborers that they were discharged until they passed a satisfactory
civil service examination. The man with the hoe will be required to write an essay on the manage
ment of the lawn mower, explain the cube root of a rose bush and tell the proper way of wrestling
with a rake.
The new Police Judges have struck a vein of fellow feeling fcr the unfortunates. If they have
their way the drunks are to be spared the mortification of being marched into court and paraded
before the public, and officers who make arrests at night are not to be called from their peaceful
slumbers to testify against the transgressors. The Judges will listen, as formerly, to the tales of
woe and the explanations in the City Prison, and on the promise of the prisoners to be good they
have decided to make their few hours' stay in the cells the only punishment. This rule is not to
apply to the chronics, only to those who have poor but honest parents.
One of the funniest things that has come about with the new order of things i 3 the determina
tion of the Board of Works to sweep out the City Hall. It has not yet been determined what dispo
sition is to be made of the accumulation of rubbish and dirt of past administrations, but the ad
visability of filling in a section of the Pacific Ocean is being seriously considered.
The corridors outside of the rooms of the Board of Health are knee-deep with the tears of thÂ«
"has beens." Devoto and his corps of faithful followers are waiting for a decision from Attorney
General Ford that never seems to come.
The Board of Works has not been smoking, but it has discovered smoke, and It has decided
that several City Hall chimneys should not end ln the garret. The extension of the chimneys
throusrh the roof Is to be one of the reforms of new San Francisco.
One of the most graceful exits from office was that of ex-Sheriff Martin, ably aÂ«s!"*ted by
Deputy William Daily. Daily had a little difference with his heavy-weight chief, and rather than
make the affair set-lous Martin side-stepped through the outer door and has been side-^teDDlne out
of Daily's sight ever since.
These and many similar incidents force the belief that, politically speaking, thÂ© old adage
'Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone," is not a poet's dream.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10.â Admiral Hich
born, chief of the Bureau of Construction
and Repair, has made a report to the Sec
retary of the Navy, showing, that favor
able progress is being made on the ves
sels under construction for the navy. The
battleship 'Kearsarge is reported to be
within 2 per cent of completion and the
battleship Kentucky within 3 per cent.
Both of these vessels are under construc

battleships nearing completion are the
Alabama, at Cramp & Sons, S2 per cent;
the Wisconsin, at the Union Iron Works.
S3 per cent, and the Illinois, at Newport

the Ohio is one-tenth completed.
STRENGTH OF GOEBEL.
Test Vote in the House of Kentucky's
Legislature".
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Jan. 10.â The adop
tion In the House to-day of the rules
which will govern the joint assembly by
a decisive majority was a surprise as
well as a disappointment to the Republi
cans and anti-Goebel Democrats In the
Legislature. They had not expected to
defeat the rules, but they confidently be
lieved the vote would be close. Ex-Con
gressman W. C. P. Breckinridge, who
has assumed direction of the anti-Goebel
Democratic forces, was ln conference
with ex-Governor Bradley, Governor Tay
lor's attorney, a long time to-day and it
Is said they are preparing to spring legal
objections to the manner ln which Goe
bel's contest is being conducted, one of
which is that the Legislature should have
first passed an act authorizing the con
test.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 10.â William
L. Wilson, former Postmaster General,
passed through Kansas City to-day en
route to Arizona, where he will spend the

pulmonary troubles. The regents of the
University of Virginia, of which Mr. Wil
son is president, have voted him an In
definite leave of absence.
Miners Snowbound.
SEATTLE. Jan. 10. â Two hundred and
forty Klondlkers were snow barricaded
at Bennett last Friday when the steamer
Rosalie, which arrived to-night, sailed
from Skaguay. They were waiting Tor
a Skaguay train to get across to sait
water. Some of them had been there a
week, and the crowd was daiiy Increasing
by upriver additions from Dawson. From
Bennett to the capital of the Klondike the
ice trail has been in splendid condition
for more than a month, which started
people from the district by the score.
Chamber of Commerce Organized.
STOCKTON. Jan. 10.â The Stockton
Chamber of Commerce was organized to
night with an' active membership of fifty
business men. Mayor W. B. Harrison was
elected president. P. A. Buell. president
of the San Joaquin Valley Association,

Suicide of a Butcher.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 10.â Edwin Abel, a Mil
pitas butcher, aged 50 years, committed
suicide this evening by blowing the top
of his head off with a. rifle. The act was
committed ln a storeroom near the house.
The cause Is not known. Ha was a man
of means and family.
Special Jury Ordered.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 10.â Judge Dalnger

Meek vs. Santa Rosa and others for an
advisory Jury. The case will come *up
Monday for an accounting, as directed
by the Supreme Court, to -ascertain the
actual value of the waterworks.
Neff Sent the Docu
ment.
The resignation of State Senator Law
rence J. Dwyer, a copy of which was re
cently published ln The Call, has been for
warded to Lieutenant Governor Neff and
by him transmitted to Governor Gage.
Mr. Dwyer resigned his State legislative
office in order to qualify as Supervisor of
the city and county of San Francisco.
Owing to the resignation, the Nineteenth
Senatorial District Is unrepresented in the
Senate of this State.
The constitution (article IV, section 12)
provides: "When vacancies occur in
either house, the Governor, or the per
son exercising the functions of the Gov
ernor, shall issue writs of election to fill
such vacancies."
The statute giving force to the consti
tutional provision requires that the Gov
ernor shall at once issue the writ of elec
tion.
It is presumed, therefore, that the chief
magistrate, having been officially advised
of the Dwyer vacancy, will not indefinite
ly postpone the issuance of the writ. Last
February he called a special election in
the Eighth Senatorial District to fill the
vacancy in the Senate caused by the
death of John Boggs. The point was then
raised that .the Legislature would be on
the eve of adjournment before Mr. Boggs'
successor could be chosen, but the Gov
ernor met this contention .with the argu
ment that he had no discretionary power
In the premises, as the law clearly made
It his duty to call the election at once.
The voters, and especially the Demo
cratic voters ln the Nineteenth Senatorial
District, would like to have another elec
tion this season and they are clearly en
titled to it under the constitution and the
law. Elections are about all the comforts
that the Democratic voters derive from
the government. It is true that they have
had already this season one primary elec
tion, one municipal election and two bond
elections, but they have not had anything
else. The patriots are, therefore, willing
to rally around the ballot box once more.
To test the sense of the voters in the
Nineteenth Senatorial District there ought
to be two Democratic candidates and two
Republican candidates for Senator. One
of the Democrats should be nominated on
a platform indorsing the local administra
tion of Mayor Phelan and one of the Re
publicans should be nominated on a plat
form indorsing the State administration
of Governor Gage. It would be interest-

COAST'S JOBBERS TO
BE HEARD IN MARCH
INTERSTATE COMMISSIONERS
NAME A DATE.
Preftnt Status Is Entirely Satis
factory to the Pacific Coast
Parties Interested.
March 15 has been finally fixed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission as the
date for the beginning of the hearing to
be held in San Francisco in the suit
brought by the St. Louis and other Middle
West jobbers against the transcontinental
railroads, to which the jobbers of the Pa
cific Coast became parties in Interest by
intervention. The fixing of a later date
for the hearing than was at one time
thought to be probable will not inconveni
ence the Interests of the Pacific Coast, as
existing conditions here are just what the
Jobbers and manufacturers of the coast
desire. They would be pleased to have
them continue Indefinitely. The supposi
tion is that the delay has b*?en occasioned
by the engagements of Commissioner
Knapp, who has promised to lecture be
fore some Eastern University.
On the day fixed by the commission to
begin taking testimony there will be gath
ered In San Francisco representatives of
all the commercial and manufacturing in
terests on the coast to testify against the
proposed abrogation of differentials be
tween the carload and less than carload
shipments, and also against the proposi
tion for graded rates from the Atlantic
seaboard westward to St. Louis. The case
is really ready for presentation on the
part of the Pacific Coast now and there
is abundant evidence. The testimony Is
at hand showing the Justice of the claims
of the coast.
In the interim before the hearing, ac
cording to information received here yes
terday, another matter of Interest to the
coast, because it has established a prece
dent concerning the less than carload dif
ferential, will come up for hearing in New
York. This is the change in the official
classification, which affected all roads and
all territory east of the Mississippi River
when it went into effect on the Ist day of
January.
The hearing has been brought abcrut
throueh the Merchants' Association of
New York. The parties to be represented
are the association named and the official
classification committee and the Trunk
Line Association. President William F.
King of the New York Merchants' Asso

ROOT NOT A CANDIDATE.
Secretary of War Does Not Want the
Vice Presidency.
MILWAUKEE. Jan. 10.â Henry C.
Payne, National Republican Committee
man of Wisconsin, to-day received a let
ter from Hon. Elihu Root, Secretary of
War, ln which Mr. Root states that he
will not be a candidate for the Vice Pres
idency of the United States. In the letter
Mr. Root states that he deems it far more
important to the country, the administra
tion and the Republican party at this crit
ical time of war that he should continue
to attend to the business of the War
Office, not that there are no other men
who could well discharge the duties of
Secretary of War, but, having spent five
or six months in becoming familiar with
the subject, no other man could step in
and take up the work without going
through the Â«ame training. Being a can
didate for Vice President would mean hia
practical withdrawal from the duties of
the War Office within a very short time.
TO DESTROY TRUSTS.
Butler Proposes Government Owner-
ship of Public Utilities.
WASHINGTON', Jan. 10.â Senator But

the Government to destroy trusts by re

The plan proposed is to control the is
suance of money and to control the rail

by the Government, when, the resolution
sets forth, "the three greatest trust 3 for
evil known to civilization will have been
destroyed and at the same time the

MAXWELL WILL
SUE TO RETAIN
HIS POSITION
There is a feeling of unrest among the
firemen of San Francisco, caused by the
realization of the fact that at present the
city is without a fire department, and has
been since the new charter went into ef
fect.
The reorganization Is not yet complete
and there have been virtually no changes
made in the make-up of the different ccm
pames. Before the appointment of the
new Commissioners, the firemen were
alone ln the scramble to retain their
places under the new order of things, but
now even the raen ln the buggies are wor
rying.
When the firemen received their instruc
tions for the primary and the municipal
elections to work hard for Phelan, it v/as
given out ln all the houses that ln re
turn for his Influence Sam Rainey's de
mand that the fire department should not
be disturbed was acceded to, and that the
Bush-street boss was to be "it," if Phe
lan carried away the Mayoralty plum.
Kainey certainly delivered the goods, so
far as votes were concerned, and after
election started h'.s list of what he con
sidered the best men to be retained ln the
new organization.
When the Fire Commissioners at first
opporturuty dropped George Maxwell.
Rainey realized that he had seen the cora
ner.ce.-nent of his finish. To Maxwell this
last nave was unexpected, though not
surprising as he had btren aware for some
time that Mayor Phelan had declared
himself in favor of J. C. Gorman.
Rainey met the Mayor's representative
in Maxwell's behalf and ante-election
promises were dragged forth, but to no
avail, a? the best Kainey could get was
that Maxwell's name was not mentioned
in the promise and that a man or two
would make no material difference.
When the Interview was over Rainey
realized that his list of firemen would
not pull through, and consequently hia
men must hustle for themselves.
Maxwell Intends to fight his case to the
bitter end. and will to-day, through his
attorney Garret McEnerney, apply for
a writ of mandate to compel the Com
missioners to reinstate him as secretary
and to recognize him as such.
Maxwell said last night to a Call re
porter that his suit was for the purpose
of protecting his own rights and deter
mining the standing of the men of the
department.
"The Commissioners, he said, are
as*uiil t ".g powers that are not vested in
them. They claim it their right to place
a man on the retention list, or the ac
tive llÂ«t as they deem best, and in my
case according to their way of thinking.
they can enlist me aÂ« an extraman or to
ar.y position they desire.
"I c'aim that when a man is .reinstated
it muÂ«t be to a position as high as that
occurred when dropped from the active
list The Commissioners had no right to
remove me. and if they are upheld In
their action it will upset the entire de
partment, and no man is secure in his
position. It makes the department a big
political machine, as the Commissioners
can if they desire, fill the department
with men who are politically of their
aÃumorÂ«a RumorÂ« of surprising changes ln the
department are thick, and top-notchers
as well as the firemen will be on the
anxious seat for som* time to come.
Ing of the differences between the carload
and less than carload rates. The changes
ln the official classification number over
.00, of which 230 are on hardware and iron
articles. Five of the latter are on car
loads and 235 are en less than carloads.
Of eighty-four advances in grocery arti
cles sixteen apply to carload shipments.
The remainder are on the less than car
load lots.
signing the forestry claim the claimant
is given scrip which he is at liberty to
place on 'public lands anywhere in the
United States. This scrip is transferable
to any one. Consequently it has been
sold, and there are parties in this city
who have been making a business of cov
ering supposed oil lands with the scrip
and getting reimbursement by taking a
half interest in the land for their pay.
Several mining oil companies have taken
the scrip and placed it on top of the min
eral filings they have made. They are
not especially concerned .in the outcome,
but others are looking on at the pro
ceeding now pending with considerable
interest.
The mineral locators have had two de
cisions that seemed to make it neces
sary for them to establish the existence
of oil in the lands they ha\-e taken up.
One of these was by the Department of
the Interior and the other by Judge Ros3
in a recent suit at Los Angeles.

smaller vote. There would not be the
slightest danger of the election of either

Governor Gage arrived in the city from
Sacramento yesterday. He admitted that
Senator Dwyer's resignation was received
at the executive office, but failed to ex
tend his thanks to The Call for Informing
him in advance that the resignation was
on the way to the capitol.
GAGE RECEIVES
RESIGNATION OF
SENATOR DWYER
POLITICALLY this is a cold world. Many seÂ« humor, ln misery, but few find sympathy for the
sorrowing. The pangs and heartaches of the "outs" find no re-echoing chord in the hearts of
the every-day man. while the glory and the glee of the "ins" seem to be contagious with
every one that has no desire to hold office and whose only satisfaction in having the electoral
franchise is to help the other fellow get a fat job.
Since the charter changes at the City Hall the big pile is fairly teeming with funny
things. Down in the basement, where the keepers of the peace hold forth, there is consternation
over the prospects of an order from Acting Chief of Police Biggy that every officer on the force
must appear every day with a clean collar. Mr. Blggy is interested in a laundry. Some people also
see something humorous in his order that Chinatown must be cleansed.
Phil Fay Jr.. secretary of the Park Commissioners, and Superintendent McLaren have taken
account of stock. They spent a day counting the shrubs and the grass plats in the city parks and
informing the gardeners and laborers that they were discharged until they passed a satisfactory
civil service examination. The man with the hoe will be required to write an essay on the manage
ment of the lawn mower, explain the cube root of a rose bush and tell the proper way of wrestling
with a rake.
The new Police Judges have struck a vein of fellow feeling fcr the unfortunates. If they have
their way the drunks are to be spared the mortification of being marched into court and paraded
before the public, and officers who make arrests at night are not to be called from their peaceful
slumbers to testify against the transgressors. The Judges will listen, as formerly, to the tales of
woe and the explanations in the City Prison, and on the promise of the prisoners to be good they
have decided to make their few hours' stay in the cells the only punishment. This rule is not to
apply to the chronics, only to those who have poor but honest parents.
One of the funniest things that has come about with the new order of things i 3 the determina
tion of the Board of Works to sweep out the City Hall. It has not yet been determined what dispo
sition is to be made of the accumulation of rubbish and dirt of past administrations, but the ad
visability of filling in a section of the Pacific Ocean is being seriously considered.
The corridors outside of the rooms of the Board of Health are knee-deep with the tears of thÂ«
"has beens." Devoto and his corps of faithful followers are waiting for a decision from Attorney
General Ford that never seems to come.
The Board of Works has not been smoking, but it has discovered smoke, and It has decided
that several City Hall chimneys should not end ln the garret. The extension of the chimneys
throusrh the roof Is to be one of the reforms of new San Francisco.
One of the most graceful exits from office was that of ex-Sheriff Martin, ably aÂ«s!"*ted by
Deputy William Daily. Daily had a little difference with his heavy-weight chief, and rather than
make the affair set-lous Martin side-stepped through the outer door and has been side-^teDDlne out
of Daily's sight ever since.

NOVELTIES OF INVENTION.
SOME of the inventions for which patents have
been recently sought are sufficiently novel to be
generally interesting. Though a good many of
them may prove to be of little value for practical use,
they show the infinite variety of purpose to which the
minor inventors of our country are directing their
thoughts and energies. None of them are so sensa
tional as that of the Russian who is trying to discover
a serum to prevent men from growing old, or of the
Frenchman who is making experiments with dead
bodies in an effort to find a means of restoring life,
but they are nevertheless ample evidences of the in
genuity of our people.
As American life is essentially utilitarian, most^f
our inventions are devised to effect a saving of labor
in some way, or to improve the methods of perform
ing some common act of work. One inventor has de
vised a plan by which mail carriers driving in carts
can collect mail from boxes by the wayside without
getting out of the cart. Another has a method of
fastening an animal to a post in such a way as to al
low opportunity for grazing without getting entangled
in the rope, or getting the rope wrapped around the
post
One of the most ingenious things is a new style of
picture devised by a Georgia artist. He paints the
background upon one piece of glass or other trans
pp.rent substance and the various, objects of the pic
ture on other pieces. These separate pictures are
then stacked together, the foreground being placed
first and the others in their order between it and the
background. The different pieces are separated from
one another by spacing blocks. When looked at the
eye passes through the transparencies to the back
ground, and it is said very fine effects in perspective
can be obtained in that way. One of the advantages
of the method is that it is not necessary to make the
different pieces fit exactly,. and it does not matter if
the various objects painted on them overlap. If there
was a tree on the second sheet and a house directly
behind it on the third sheet, the tree trunk would ob
scure just that portion of the house which it would
tinder actual conditions, the house showing through
the branches of the trees in a natural way. Conse
quently, as the observer changes his position the tree
will cover different portions of the house behind it.
thus altering the angle of perspective of the picture
and producing an effect upon the eye which closely
resembles the change of perspective in a landscape or
other scene when the position of the observer is
changed.
Housewives and professional cooks may be pleased
to know there has been devised a method of roasting
boneless meats without binding them together with
wooden skewers. An Illinois man has invented a
system of elastic binding which holds the meat to
gether and tightens automatically during the cooking
process, so that the meat can be cooked in any 6hape
desired.
Another notable invention is that of putting up
electricity in capsules for home use. According to
the claims of the inventor a three-grain capsule of it,
put into an ordinary battery cell, will yield enough
electricity to run a sixteen-candle power incandescent
light for one hour. It. is said that the chemical can
be sold as cheaply as calomel. It is also said that the
new agent will not consume zinc in the battery as
rapidly as the solution now in use.
These are by no means all of the novelties. There
are others even more whimsical. For example, an in
ventor at Helena, Mont, has patented a horseshoe
sharpener. Two ladies of Harrisburg, in Pennsyl
vania, have patented, jointly, a "serving-maid's step
ladder," guaranteed not to upset when in use. A
Wisconsin man has patented a collapsible coffin, sep
arated into subsections and as portable as a hand
satchel. A Minnesota man has patented a disappear
ing visor or peak whereby mechanically a soldier's
hat may be turned into a polo cap by pressing a but
ton to be found over the left ear.
It will be seen from these things that while the
European scientists may lead us in efforts to obtain
immortal life or to raise- the dead, we are leading in
the arts that make such life as we have more enjoy
able and easier on the worker. Up to this time our
ingenuity has been devoted almost wholly to devising
appliances for industrial pr domestic life, but pc-haps
we may soon direct it to municipal needs, and
then we may get an automatic Mayor or self-regulat
ing Police Commissioners, and be spared much
trouble that now harasses us. ,
Amid the musical, sweet sounds of the time is a
song containing this verse:
For I am the Mayor bold.
And soon I hope to be
The cuy clerks
And the Public Works
- And the free dispensary.
Then I'll be the Water Board,
The City Council, too;
The Police Chief
I'll bring to grief
And I'll be the entire crew.
It may be necessary to state that the song is not de
signed for the Mayor of San Francisco, but the
Mayor of Baltimore.

THE CURSE OF PUBLIC GAMBLING.
\A AYOR PHELAN in his annual message
/ \ epoke encouragingly of the improvement to
be brought about in the Police Department
by the operation of the new charter. The evils which,
existed under, the old system he attributed mainly to
the influences emanating from the Chinese quarter.
X"Chinatown,"'K "Chinatown,"' he Raid, "where prostitution and gam
bling in violation of law can only exist by connivance
cf the police, has been a field of corruption demoral
izing to the department."
The Mayor then went on in these words, whose
truth cannot be disputed and whose warning ought
to be impressed upon the Supervisors and upon every
other official having any authority in such matters:
"Public gambling is a great evil, leading to poverty,
disgrace, defalcation and death, which the records of
this department abundantly prove, and its practice
should be discountenanced and suppressed.
It is not in Chinatown only that there has been
public gambling in San Francisco, nor has it been
solely to the effects of vice in that quarter that the
police records of the *ity contain so many stories of
thame, crime ar.d suicide. To the track gambling at
Ingleside Park dunng the time of its existence
under its recent management could be traced
as many trails of fraud and of blood as to
the slums of Chinatown. Comparatively few per
sons of the industrious element of the community
zre betrayed a/id mined by the enticements of China
town, but the Inglcside track debauched and ruined
men and even women in all grades of society. The
confidential . employes of large business houses,
trusted public officers, women of high social stand
ing, were caught in that spider-web of gambling, and
many of them were ruined utterly and escaped prison
only by flight or suicide.
The Mayor has done. well in pointing out these
evils to the Supervisors and recalling public attention
once more to the record of the results of public
gambling. They were all familiar enough during the
outburst of popular indignation against the track
gamblers which induced the late Board of Super
visors to suppress the nefarious trade, but they may
r - ....
have been forgotten to some extent, and it is timely
to revive the memory of them now that the gamblers
arc boasting of having a majority of the present board

pledged to permit them to resume the old practices.

vice to teach wisdom to all of its people for the rest

CONVENTION WAS
PACKED, THINKS
MEMBER KEARNEY
Cattle v Men Dictated
Its Policy.
FLOOD SAVERS WERE FOOLED
Â»
FOBESTS ENDANGERED BY THE
COUBSE TAKEN.
M. Theo. Kearney said last night, In an
interview, that the recent California
water and forest convention was
"packed" by the cattle men for the pur
pose of getting Indorsement for their
scheme to have the Government lease to
them timbered land in this State for the
grazing of their herds of cattle and sheep.
"I was a member of the committee on
platform at that convention," said Mr.
Kearney. "I fought in the committee to
have a declaration against the use of
timbered lands by the cattle men. 1
brought in a minority report from the
committee on platform, opposing the leas
ing of timbered lands. P. A. Buell, In the
committee, proposed the Insertion of the
word 'untimbered' in the resolution con
cerning the grazing lands, so that it would
have read: 'We favor the leasing of the
untimbered public grazing lands at a
nominal rental," etc. We fought to havo
the word in and we won the fight then
for the time being. The commute worked
all night. About midnight there was an
attempt to have the word 'untimbered'
dropped, but the attempt failed. But, in
the morning, when some of those who
had stood up for the proposition to ex
empt the timbered lands from the pro
visions of the resolution were absent, the
word was stricken out and the report
went to the convention in that shape.
"The convention was nearly over when
the discussion concerning the grazing
lands came up. Some of the delegates had
gone home. Some of the city delegates,
who understood the matter, were disin
clined to make a fuss. 1 objected to the
adoption of the resolution as it stood. Ho
did Will S. Green. The attorneys fought
for it. The telegraphic dispatches from
.Washington . tell of the progress of the
Foster bill providing for leases of
public grazing lands. The cnttle
men are represented as being dis
satisfied with the chance to lease the
lands for ten years, and they say that
they should have at least fifteen years,
and they would like to have the leases
for twenty years. In ten years the for
ests would be ruined. The verdure would
be gone, and the land would t>Â© packed
hard. The rainfall would run off and be
lost, for the soil would no longer be
spongy as It now is.
"It is no new thing for the cattle men to
work against the interest of the other
people of the State. When the agricul
tural settlers first began to plant In the
San Joaquin Valley it was all their lives
were worth. The cattle men did not want
them there. They let their cattle- in to
destroy the wheat. The tight to make
them fence their ranges took years
before success was reached. They fought
the irrigators in turn. Mr. Maxwell, who
led the national irrigationiÃts In the late
convention of the Water and Forest Asso
ciation, has been the attorney, so I am
told, in nearly all the suits against the
irrigation districts organized under the
Wright law. When the late convention
was proposed the national irrigators, who
are the cattle men, fought in every way
possible. They did not want to have It.
It took money to carry on that fight. The
cattle men put up that money, in my opin
ion. Delegations were fixed all over the
State.. Wnen- the convention came to
gether William Thomas, who had started
the movement and who felt. desirous of
having it a success, was shaking in his
boots for fear that he would be outvoted.
The cattle men were in a majority. They
had the attorneys In the convention,
whose business it was to see that the
leasing of grazing lands should be in
dorsed and also to see that there should
be no exemption of timbered lands. The
Foster bill and the proceedings of the con
vention fit in together. They are all in
pursuance of the same purpose and the
sump plan of the cattle men.
"My opposition was to the leasÂ© of the
timbered lands north of Tehachapi In
California. If there Is anything that we
ought to preserve it is the timber of the
Sierras. I said that the other States and
Territories were perhaps able to take care
of themselves, but that we ought to stand
up for California. The forest growth and
the grass on the mountains constitute the
-pieapest form of a storage reservoir,
'J- eeplng back the waters until a large
Share of them Is absorbed by the soil.
1 "It is not too late to do something if
there is public spirit In California to tako
the matter up. The California delegation
in Congress should be urged at once to
oppose the Foster bill. I am extremely
Indignant that our State convention
should -have been so bamboozled as to
advocate the destruction of the best reser
voir that we had.
"The â¢ resolution that the convention
adopted was a sham. It provided that the
revenue arising from the lease of the pub-
Ho grazing lands should be applied to
supplying us with Irrigation works. The
rates that th# cattlemen are ready to
pay for the lands are from one to three
cents per acre. The cost of collection
would equal the whole revenue and there
would be nothing left, as any sensible
man knows. That resolution was all rot.
A bigger fraud was never put on the peo
ple. If our convention should lead to the
passage of the Foster bill then the con
vention could be estimated as the worst
that could have been held for our wel
fare. The Government can protect the
timbered land by having guardians and
keeping off the sheep and the cattle, pro
viding penalties for infringement that
would be respected. If cattlemen must
destroy the timber on all the other moun
tain ranges in the country let them leave
the ranges of California alone. If the
lands are leased the Government will be
powerless to Interfere while the forests
are being destroyed."

THE TAXATION OF TELEPHONES.
OUR Eastern exchanges are giving no little con
sideration to a recent decision of the Supreme
Court of Ohio upon the taxable value of tele
phones,' in which the court laid down a principle
which if generally accepted will lead to a marked
change in the imposition of taxes upon all kinds of
rnrnr>rn?inn<;.
It appears from the reports that the cost of a tele
phone is about $3 40, while the rent charged for the
use of it in Ohio is $14 a year. The telephone com
panies contended that the tax rate should be assessed
upon the cost value of the telephone, but the Su
preme Court has decided that the renting value should
govern, and accordingly sustained an assessment of
each telephone at a valuation of $233, capitalizing at
6 per cent the annual rental value.
It is stated that the decision is in line with a de
cision made by the same court a few years ago in an
issue affecting the assessment of the Adams Express
Company. In that case it was conceded that the value
of the property of the express company in Ohio was
hardly more than $500,000, but that the earnings of
the company in the State amounted to several mil
lions. The court held that the company must pay
taxes upon the earnings and not upon the mere value
of the apparatus used in the business.
According to the New York Sun, the opposite doc
trine prevails in that State. "Our Court, of Appeals,"
it says, "decided in the Union Trust Company case
that the intangible good will which the company has
created by the skill, enterprise and integrity of its
management, and which leads buyers to pay for its
stock a vastly higher price than is warranted by the
mere book value of its assets, is not a proper subject
of taxation. It is analogous to the professional
reputation of a lawyer or a physician, or to the credit
of a banker or a merchant, which, indeed, have a
pecuniar}' value to their owners, but which, being
incapable of transference to other owners, should not
be taxed."
The argument of the Sun that the income of a tele
phone or an express company is analogous to that of
a professional man cannot be sustained. The profes
sional reputation which enables a successful lawyer
or physician \o make large earnings cannot be sold or
transferred, and is therefore not to be regarded as
property; but the earning power of a franchise like
that of a telephone corporation can be sold in the
market, and is sold whenever any of its stock is mar
keted. There is, in fact, none of that "intangible good
will/ of which the Sun speaks, involved in the value
of telephone or express business, for it matters noth
ing to the managers of either of those monopolies
whether they have the good will of the community or
not.
The wide differences which exist in the methods of
various States in dealing with questions relating to
corporations arc by no means creditable to the
sagacity of our lawmakers or our Judges. Experience
must by this time have shown which State has reached
the best method of taxing them, and what principles
of law are most applicable to the justice of the issues
between them and the people. Nevertheless the whole
subject remains in confusion, and what courts of Ohio
declare to be justice those of New York regard as
something very like confiscation. It is about time
something like uniformity prevailed on such issues,
for they have now become among the most important
in our politics.

divided between them. Thus the Senator finds it im
perative to do something at Washington to counter
act the work his opponents are doing at home to
weaken his influence with the voters.
Morgan entered the Senate in 1877 and bad at that
time a notable array of Southern colleagues, among
them being Lamar of Mississippi, Garland of Ar
kansas, Isham G. Harris of Tennessee, Ransom of
North Carolina and Ben Hill of Georgia.. Of that
group Morgan is the only one left He was ac
counted a radical Democrat in his time, but now he
is too conservative for the young men of Alabama,
and the fight against him is being made ostensibly on
the ground that he is not loyal to Bryan, not suffi
ciently devoted to the cause of free silver. To meet
the fight of the Bryanites he falls back upon the old
familiar Democratic battle-field of the South and
makes an effort to rally the people to him by standing
forth in the Senate as the champion of the white man
against negro equality.
Reports from Alabama show that the conflict be
tween the contending forces is doubtful. Morgan is
a strong and resourceful leader, but he is old, while
his opponent, Governor Johnson, has been in that
office for two terms and has political patronage as
well as comparative youth on his side. Fortunately
for the Senator, the opposition is divided, and two
other candidates share with Johnson the hope of suc
ceeding to his seat. His defeat would remove a no
table figure from the Senate, and one of its most
influential members, for ever since the retirement of
Edmunds Morgan has been recognized as the ablest
lawyer in the upper, house. It would be the more
noticeable because Senator Vest has announced that
he will not be a candidate for re-election. Thus
Democracy would lose two veteran leaders at once,
and it is doubtful if their successors would be able
to fill their places.
THE HOUSE PICTURE GALLERY.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 11, 1900.
HONOR THE HEROIC DEAD.
r\ RMY headquarters report that the body of the
j\ late General Lawton was shipped from Manila
* * on the transport Thomas and is expected to
reach this port about the ist of February. There
will be of course a military, demonstration in honor
of the memory of the hero when the transport ar
rives, and the body will be received with observances
due to Lawton's rank and service and his death on
the field of battle.
It would be altogether right and fitting for the
Mayor to take action to mark the occasion by a civil
as well as a military display. Something should be
done by the city to show the respect which the peo
ple of the. whole country have. for the illustrious
dead. It should not be left for his military com
rades alone to do honor to his memory. The great
body of his fellow-citizens, for whose interests he
fought and for whose flag he died, should be repre
sented by dignitaries of civil life taking part in the
solemn ceremonies which attend the return of his
body to his native land.
General Lawton well merited every honor that can
be conferred upon his memory. In his career he rep
resented the best type of the American soldier. As a
cavalry leader he exhibited a remarkable faculty for
war, and had he had the fortune to command a large
body of troops in a great campaign would doubtless
have ranked with Sheridan and Stuart among the
foremost cavalrymen the world has known. His life
has been the thing of greatest value we have yet had
to pay for our possessions in the Philippines, and
San Francisco, as the representative of the civil bodies
of the country, should unite with the army and the
National Government in receiving his remains with
due honor.

he found anything addressed to Geoffrey
Chaucer he took It and made the most of
It. Shakespeare must have found a great
many things addressed to him in North's
translation of "Plutarch's Lives" (pub
lished in 1579), for out of it he got the ma
terial for "Julius Caesar," "Antony and
Cleopatra," "Timon of Athens" and
"Corlolanus." He was not at all careful
about adopting the scenes and incidents;
sometimes he even used the very lan
guage of Plutarch. It would be a profit
able task fcr a student of "Coriolanus"
to take down his North's Plutarch and
compare it with the play. He would be
struck by the decided similarity of the
two, and if he has fine ears and what De
Quincey calls an understanding heart he
would have a valuable lesson in distin
guishing between the dramatist and the
historian, between the myriad-mindednesa
of Shakespeare and the limited range of
Plutarch.
Hazlitt'3 Mistake aa to the Play.
Hazlitt, who was at times a discrim
inating critic of Shakespeare, was very
wide of the mark when he said with his
characteristically revolutionary spirit:
"The whole dramatic moral of 'Coriola
nus' is that those who have little shall
have less, and that those who have much
shall take all that others have left. The
people are poor, therefore they ought to
be starved. They are slaves, therefore
they ought to be beaten. They work
hard, therefore they ought to be treated
like beasts of burden." When Hazlitt
wrote this he must have had in mind the
tragedy of' the French revolution, of
which he was one of the belated prophets.
He might have come from a meeting at
Godwin's or a conversation with Shelley.
Such personal criticism is of a kind with
Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet. It is too
much after the order of early German
criticism that sought to reduce all of
Shakespeare's plays to certain moral
truths that the dramatist tried to incul
cate.
There are many striking things said In
this play about the mobs, Just as there
are in "Julius Caesar." But I doubt If
Shakespeare himself understood fully the
nature of the struggle between the plebe
ians and the patricians. He certainly does
not make as clear In the play as one
might expect the issue between them,
which shows that Shakespeare did not
care much himself for local coloring and
evidently did not wish to teach certain
facts about the plebeians. It is always
dangerous to say that, Shakespeare
teaches anything; certainly he does not
Identify himself with Coriolanus in this
play. He looks at him from the same ab
solute standpoint from which he views the
populace.
The Character of Coriolanus.
No, in this play we do not have a study
of political parties in Rome; the "study/
if we may use that term in an undldactic
sense, is Coriolanus himself. It is his
figure that dominates every scene in the
play. He is a character of heroic propor
tions. The of tener one reads the play the
more he feel 3 that here is one of Shake
speare's most imposing characters. He is
a man of power and in every way Is the
protagonist of the drama. Hamlet is not
more essential to the play that bears his
name than is Coriolanus to "Coriolanus."
One may not admire him In many ways,
and no one is drawn to him as a friend,
but there is something about him that is
gigantic and wonderful. He is a character
of the early Roman world not weakened
as Caesar was by personal Infirmities, or
as Antony was by love and lust, or as
Brutus by an inability to cope with
practical affairs. Coriolanus is a tower of
strength. His body is of gigantic propor
tions; he can fight against an entire army
when once within the walls of the enemy;
his voice Is thunderlike, so that his ene
mies shake as if the world were feverous
and did breathe. One knows the sound of
Marcius' tongue from every meaner man.
His will is imperious to warn, to threaten
and to command.
He carries about with him the badge of
hl3 strength even when disguised as a
peasant. The servants of Aufldius recog
nize him as no common man. "My mind
gave me his clothes and made a false re
port of him." "What an arm he has! He
turned me about with his finger and his
thumb as one would set a top." "I knew
by his face that there was something In
him. He Is simply the rarest man in the
world." Whether talking with the mob,
fighting battles or speaking to his soldiers
he is always the same heroic figure:
Ha is their god; he leads them like a thine
Made by some other diety than nature.
That shanes man better.
One thinks of him In connection with
Swift, whose fall, to quote the words of
Thackeray, was like that of an empire.
"He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne In."

Now, in what does the tragedy consist?

might be. taken as the keynote to many of

?
VIOLATION OF TRUST AVERRED
? Â¦
RETAILERS' ASSOCIATION THE
PLAINTIFF IN FACT.
A blacklist, Issued by tho Retail Gro
cers' Association and intended solely for
the information of its members to pro
tect them against those who eat but fall
to pay, has resulted in the filing of a suit
for $10,000 damages against John Elliott
and James West, succeeding partners to
the firm of Montgomery & Company, gro
cers and tea merchants at 31 Sixth street,
118 Third street, 1645 Polk street and 600
Hayes street.
In the complaint filed yesterday, which
charges the defendants with a violation
of trust and agreement, with aiding those
who sought to pirate the commercial in
formation placed In their hands and with
exposing names of people to the gaze of
outsiders who had no right to their in
spection, the Interstate Law and Collec
tion Company appears as plaintiff. In
fact, however, the Retail Grocers' Asso
ciation, of which the plaintiff is a branch,
is the complainant, and, through Attorney
Albert M. Armstrong, is prosecuting the
suit.
Defendant John Elliott, In addition to
hiÃ prominence in business circles, is more
widely known as a member of the Olympic
Club. Mr. West, his partner, although
not as closely identified with the social
side of life, is equally well known, and
the charge against them by the Retail
Grocers' Association has occasioned In
tense surprise.
Karly in the week suit was filed in tho
United States Court by the association
against the Robbins agency to recover
$25,000 damages sustained, it was alleged,
through the action of the agency in pub
lishing the grocers' ''black list," which, in
some unknown manner, fell into the hands
of the management; also, to restrain the
agency, from issuing a January rating
book, which, the grocers claim, will again
be made up from the list of slow payers.
Twenty-three firms who subscribed for
the services of the agency were made co
defendants in the suit, and, in turn, the
plaintiff prayed that they also be re
strained from making use of the rating
book of the Robbins concern.
A. M. Armctrong. attorney for the gro
cers, in proof of the value of the black list
cites the tact that .lumerot'.s firms paid
the Robbins Agency $60 a month to be
served each month with a iiat which he
says is merely a rehash of the reports of
the Grocers' Collection Bureau. Mr. Arm
strong also said that he would lay before
the Federal Grand Jury proof of the fact
that the Robbins Agency printed the
word "copyright" on the face of its re
ports, when, in fact, no copyright had
oeen granted.
In the complaint filed yesterday against
Elliott & West the plaintiff alleges that
at great expense it has obtained the com
mercial standing and data wherefrom the
mercantile rating on many thousand resi
dents of this city may be deduced. Eight
months ago the defendants obtained from
the plaintiff the possession of lists and
data containing 12,000 names, with ad
dresses and data, wherefrom the desira
bility as credit customers of the parties
rated might be gained. The plaintiff al
leges that It gave the lists to the defend
ants for their own exclusive information
and for no other purpose under their ex
press promise and agreement not to di
vulge the same to any person, but to re
turn the lists on demand.
The lists, it is alleged, were placed In
the hands of the defendants, the com
plaint continues, owing to the fact that
the plaintiff had full confidence in the
honesty and business Integrity of the de
fendants. In violation of the trusts so
reposed in them, however, and in viola
tion of their good faith, business integ
rity and their promises and agreements,
and for the purpose of. injuring the estab
lished business of the plaintiff and of
rendering aid and profit to others desir
ous of pirating the commercial Informa
tion, plaintiff alleges that it has been In
formed that the defendants secretly and
without the knowledge or consent of the
plaintiff transferred their lists to the
Robbins Mercantile Agency, "an organ
ization about to embark in the mercan
tile report business."
By reason of the defendants' alleged
violation of the trusts and confidence Im
posed in them, â¢ plaintiff prays Judgment
against them for $10,000 damages and
costs. Â¦ . . Â¦ Â¦Â¦-; ; : 'Â¦>-'Â¦'

ius led the Volscian army into the very
gates of Rome. Cominius has pleaded
with Coriolanus only to be dismissed with
"his speechless hand," and then Mene
nius, his most faithful friend, has con
jured him to pardon Rome and his peti
tionary countrymen, but is told that ha
speaks to no purpose.
At last Virgilia and Volumnia and the
little son of Coriolanus come to his tent.
Coriolanus, with hatred toward the popu
lace still in his soul and with the desire
for revenge burning within him, says aa
he sees them coming:
But. out. affection! "
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
He cannot but feel the ties of the old
love and kneels before them. Then be
gins the dialogue between Volumnia and
Coriolanus, the former rising to tho
height of motherly love and the most
ardent patriotism (she 13 indeed the nn.
blest Roman of them all), the latter
strongly maintaining his point for awhile.

The Date of the Composition.
There is no external evidence as to the
date of "Coriolanus," but we know from
the proportion of light endings and from
the characteristics of diction and style
that It is one of Shakespeare's later plays.
It is evidently one of that group of trag
edies in which the dramatist went deeper
than ever did plummet sound into the hu
man heart. Coriolanus, the man, is a
companion of Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello
and Antony.- Commentators are warrant
ed in placing this play next to "Antony
and Cleopatra" by reason of the Roman
background and its general characteris
tics. It is the last of the great tragedies,
for "Timcn of Athens," although of later
date, docs not deserve to rank with tho
highest. We may then say with Dowden
that the date of the play Is 1608, or per
haps a little later.

Lowell said of Chaucer that whenever
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
I know there has been a decided reac
tion in recent years against the tpndency
to treat Shakespeare's tragedies from an
altogether subjective standpoint. Eane
cially is thi3 true of "Hamlet" and "Ro
meo and Juliet." We are believing more
and more that the tragedy consists in the
one case in the conflict between Hamlet
and his environment, and in the other
play to view Romeo and Juliet as "star
crossed lovers" whose happiness is blast
ed by the fury of their two houses. And
yet there is something else in the old criti
cism, too; somehow Hamlet can't adtust
himself to circumstances; with a greater
will, a saner judgment and a more fixed
faith he could do otherwise. After all.
there Is "the dram of eale" in his nature
when viewed from the absolute standpoint
(and that is Shakespeare's standpoint, for
he was indeed one of God's spies, and as
Meredith suggests, the recording angel
himself might have taken his pen).
The tragedy In "Coriolanus" arises from
the ' dram or eale" in Coriolanus' nature

natures, come face
to face with a cold,
conventional world,
and Coriolanus must
be brought in con
tact with the com
mon people whom
he loathes and tho
tribunes whom he detests. The trag
edy Is due partly to this stubborn
conflict between the people and himself,
but more especially to the Inner nature of
the hero. In act 11, scene 2. the officers
discuss Coriolanus In a very interesting
way and from the proper point of vtarar.
One of them says that there have bÂ»pn
many great men that have flattered, the
people, who ne'er loved them, thus the
indifference and scorn of Marclus. Tha
other answers, with rare wisdom and in
sight: "He seeks their hate with greater
devotion than they can render it him. nnd
leaves nothing: undone that may fully dis
cover him their opposite. Now to seem
to affect the malice and displeasure of tho
people la as bad as that which he di3llkes.
to flatter them for their love."
Coriolanus has the contempt for tho
fickleness of the mob that all thinking
people have, but he is apt to consider
that all people who are not patrlciana are
beneath his notice and worthy of con
tumely. Menenius has no use for them
either, but he laughs and Jests with them
In his hearty good humor. Volumnia
treats them with cold indifference, but
Coriolanus loses his dignity in his blind
rage against them. For once he is like
a child, he who is generally a giant. OnÂ©
wonders if the same man can be at one*
so powerful and so weak. To this pride
and passionate hatred of the people he
sacrifices the happiness of hla family and
the prosperity of his country, and finally
is willing to lead an army against the
walls of Rome. It is this weakness, this
rift within the lute," that causes ths
tragedy of the playâ "the failure of a
great soul to recognize the bonds that
bind him to other men."

TRANSFER WAS EXPECTED
EECOED OF ENLISTMENTS FOB,
MONTH OF NOVEMBER.
The transfer of Major Kucker from the
Fpurth to the Sixth Cavalry has finally
been made, and he has been ordered to
report to the commanding general of
this department. The deal has hung fire
so long that it was feared it would fall
through and that Major Rogers, newly
promoted to the Sixth Cavalry, who was
the one who wanted the transfer, would
have to stay where he was put. It Is
definitely announced at last, however,
that the change will be- made.
Major Rucker is now in this city. Â¦ He
has been on sick leave for some months
and he still has another month's leave
coming to him, but as he Is already here
it Is expected he will report for duty at
once and take command at the Presidio.
He is* the senior line officer in this depart
ment available for the assignment, ex
cepting Colonel Rawles of the Third Ar
tillery, who Is at Angel Island and seems
likely to remain there for some time to
come.
The report of the adjutant general on
the enlistments for the months of No
vember have been published In a circular
recently issued.- It shows that the total
enlistments from the recruiting stations
and from the posts and in the field
amount to 18S7 men. The enlistment sta
tions were responsible for 1503 of these
and the posts and regiments for 354.
Ninety-one of the total were colored and
625 were mounted. To get that number
of men It was necessary to examine 8435
and of these 6548 were rejected.
The record is neither high nor low. It
includes reports from 104 stations and 114
posts as well as the regiments themselves
that always recruit men who apply' to
them. The stations are scattered all over
the country and so are the posts, so the
number enlisted represents just what the
country may expect for the months to
come. It is absolutely necessary that
there be sent to the Philippines at least
500 men every month, for less than that
number will not keep up even the regular
organizations over there, so the report of
the adjutant general seems to settle the
difficulty of maintaining the force in the
Philippines. Nearly all of the men en
listed, and those being enlisted, are sent
out here to the Presidio to be prepared
for active service in the Islands.
Of the regiments for November the
Twenty-third Infantry did the best, by
recruiting thirty-three men. The Elev
enth Infantry came next, with fourteen
men.

ARTHUR PINERO'S PLAY
AND ITS PECULIARITIES
"The Princess and the Butterfly" an Important
Modern Dramaâ lts Merits and
A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF DECADENT. CLEVERNESS
Mme. Emma Nevada Is Again Welcomed by Her Friends â : Her
Second Programme Was an Interesting One and the
Singer Responds to Many Encores.
*jn? RTIIUR PINERO'S play, "The
/L\ Princess and the Butterfly." Is of
H an importance as a play that war
rants more specific comment than
I gave to it Tuesday night at its first pro
duction by the Frawley company. If re
viewed from a literary viewpoint it would
be variously deficient, for Pinero is not
an author of high literary attainments.
Indeed, we must look to-day to France for
playwrights who have a claim to the
classic crown. Aside from Ibsen there
are none but a few of M. Rostand's con
freres who have produced anything ex
alted or exalting in a strictly literary
cense. How much Hterary merit has to
do with the fitr.ess of a play for the stage
13 another question, but the fact remains
that Mr. Pinero is not a genius. He is
clever, "deuced" clever, clever without a
sparkle, clever in an age and way that
smacks of the decadent art of Bernard
Shaw. He alms to disappoint, to defeat
anticipation, to be simple without being
obvious; in bhort. to be unconventional,
different. He does not fling epigrams in
your faceâ that would be beneath his dig
nity. His lines are occasionally crisp
and meaty, but he studiously avoids any
show of brilliancy that would destroy the
tone of the whole. His aim is not truth
but rather a fictitious naturalness, a false
verisimilitude. His characters are not
real, but they might be In a place peopled
with Pineros. He has availed himself of
the satirist's license and made a series of
serious caricatures; but they are clever,
"deuced." smugly, calmly clever.
Should one read "The Princess and the
Butterfly," the play people would develop
into certain xveu defined typesâ types that
are marked without the contrasts of dis
tinct character and very difficult Indeed
to be realized by the actors in whose
hands they fall. There Is more art in
the interjection of Buch a character as
Fay Zullanl in "The Princess and the
Butterfly" than in any other stroke he
strikes, for she serves as a foil for all
the other parts and admits of skillful
handling not only by the actress but by
the author.
Pinero's peculiarities are not to be man
aged without more than ordinary intelli
gence and subtlety, and I can Imagine
nothing more disappointing than to note
the inefficient grasp by the actors of his
varied though uniform types as one
might conceive them after having made
their acquaintance gradually while read
ing the play. In "The Princess and - the
Butterfly" there is an affected absence of
climax and the author makes a bid for
the approval of his unearthly cleverness
â¢with every fall of the curtain. He blun
ders, however, in the last act, when he
has the choice of several endings that
would be characteristically ingenious, but
scorns them all to resort to convention
ality, and brings matters to a close with
his dramatis personnae drawn up in pla
toon front. I would have expected him
to drop the curtain on an empty stage
after the last exeunt of Fay and Sir
At the Columbia "The Christian" may
be seen only until Saturday night. Next
week, the James-Kidder-Hanford combi
nation will make an elaborate presenta
tion of "The Winter's Tale." It is the
first time the great comedy has been
given in San Francisco for many years,
and it should prove an event of interest.
The sale of seats opens to-day.
The Frawley company is doing good
work in Plnero's "The Princess and the
Butterfly," with Mary Scott in the part

play.
The attraction for this week at the Al
cazar is "The Mysterious Mr. Bugle."

London. This will be her first American
appearance.

What with the pleased enthusiasm of
the audience on Monday night at the
homecoming of Emma Nevada and the
gracious reception of Tuesday night of
Alary Scott to the ranks of professional
ism, an atmosphere of cordiality perme
ates the California Theater Just now. It
was augmented yesterday afternoon at
Mme. Nevada's second recital. Her
friends, who are many, seem, or rather
are, glad to 6ee her and she is content to
bo so appreciated. To note her pleasure
was a pleasure to those who were there
at her first appearance and there was
something more than an approval of her
art in the applause that greeted her sing-
Ing of "Home, Sweet Home." The con
fidential spirit that existed between the
singer and her auditors was evidenced
on her part by a graciousness of manner
that extended even to an exchange of
courtesies between the artist on the stage
and the occupants of the boxes. All of
which I repeat was pleasant to note.
The many that came again yesterday
to hear and applaud were repaid with
much good music. Mme. Nevada sang
better, I think, than on the first occa
sion, and Mr. Pratt was la better vein
and showed a surer grasp. His playing
of a Henselt etude was marked by ex
pressiveness and grace. Mme. Nevada
sang in her delicate way an aria from
David's "Perle de Bresil," in which she
was admirably accompanied on the flute
by Mr. Newbauer. For encore she sang
"Tltania's Cradle," by Liza Lehman,
whose music to "The Rubaiyat" has had
some success. A song by Taubert and a
Russian folk song in the vernacular were
not of much musical interest, but served
to show off to advantage Bemberg's "Fee
aux Chansons," which she Bang In re
sponse to an encore with greater effect
than when she sang the same number on
Monday night. It is a rather more varied
test of vocalization than some of her
members and in It her attack and method
showed to advantage. The Bame was
true of the "Llbiamo" aria from "Trav
iata," in which Mme. Nevada exceeded
somewhat her moderate dramatlclsm.
For an encore she sang "Printemps Nou
veau" by Paul Vidal, who has an inter
est as the composer of "La Burgonde,"
an opera of recent European success.
Mr. Blumenberg, upon whose capabil
ity as a cellist I have commented be
fore, gave an Intricate "Danse Hollan
dise" and for encore "Simple Aveu," by
Thome. In the latter and also in the
"Adagio .Pathetique" by Godard, he
played with a sympathetic quality and
finesse. On the mechanical side of his art
he is above criticism, and this, taken with
the soul that he puts in his instrument,
makes him what he Isâ a most distin
guished musician.

10 Paauhau Sugar Co.; 27 23
NEW YORK. Jan. 10.â The stock market was
du'.l and narrow to-day, except for the sensa
tional developments affecting the stock of the
American Sugar Refining Company. Previous
to the assembling of the stockholders' meeting
there was a considerable chow of strength in
this stock owing to a general conviction that
the suear trade war has more of shadow than
substance in it. The declarations contained In
the President's annual report rather took Wall
street's breath and caused fear that unless
conditions change dividends on the stock may
be suspended. The stock, declined rapidly, the
price varying as much as 14 between sales. The
first drop took the stock to 122, when it stead
ied and rallied above 124. It fell again to 117^.
bringing out heavy stop-loss orders on the way
down, rallied to near 122, reacted 3 and again
rallied In the final dealings. The large and
persistent outstanding short Interest In the
stock served as a recuperative force by buying
to cover contracts. All the prominent Indus
trials were sharply affected in sympathy, the
bears seizing the opportunity to offer prices
down and uncover Etop-loÂ«8 orders.
The railroads were much less affected, al
though the e-arller gains were mostly wiped out.
There was good buying in the railroads at the
decline, led by tlie Baltimore and Ohio stocks
on the company's strong statement of December
earnings. The general relaxation in money
rates all over the world has induced a convic
tion that the official discount rates both of
the Bank of England and the Imperial Bank
of Germany will be reduced to-morrow and
boerd room traders were Inclined to buy stocks
In anticipation of a foreign demand.
Stocks were generally firm to-day In foreign
markets on account of the easier money rates.
But it is very clear that the money market
owes its abundance and ease to the thorough
liquidation of speculative accounts which had
been effected all over the world in the last
few weeks and to lack of renewed speculation.
Speculators are apparently still disinclined to
t&ke on etocks and to-day's market was but
a narrow affair, even taking into account the
violent price movement of some of the spe
cialties. The prevailing dullness Is attributed
by traders to fears of unfavorable news from
South Africa, but it is not Improbable that
the existing conditions there, as well as in
the financial world, have been accurately dis
counted in the speculative markets. New de
velopments are awaited to warrant a new ad
justment of values.
The bond market was dull and moved In
sympathy with railroad stocks. Total sales,
par value, $1,025,000. United States new 4's
and s's registered declined H in the bid price.

TO SAIL.
The Outlook for 1900.
OPINION THAT IT WILL HARDLY BE AS
PHENOMENAL AS. IS.&S.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"It is very unlikely that 1&00 will be a repe
tition of 1559. Even prosperity has its fluctua
tions and drawbacks, especially when cost of
material and labor rise to a point that checks
new enterprise or leads to overproduction, with
all the Inconvenient consequences that follow.
The rise in many commodities has been quite
pronounced. In i<\g Iron and iron products
the advance has been simply phenomenal, ow
ing to the tremendous pressure of orders. The
effect of thie Is to again bring into use many
obsolete and discarded plants In all parts of
the country, which may run at a profit for a
lew months or years, but must ultimately suc
cumb to the competition of stronger and belter
equipped conceri.b when prices recede to the
r-.orinal. There are a number of very Import
ant enterprises now held in abeyance because
of the high prlre of Iron entering Into per-
xnanent struetu: : and when the present rush
of orders has bt-en satisfied and some con
cessions effected In %a!ues these buyers will
probably come into the market and so prevent
*.ny serious or too rapid decline: but it thould
not be forgotten that the present roseate con
ditions in the iron trade will not continue In
definitely. The stock market Is now more un
der the influence of iron than ever; first be
cause so many securities of that class are now
<;.?Â¦..â¢ In here and second because In various
va.ys railroad traffic is materially affected.
Any marked rafasMencs of the activity in the
Iron trad>- is. therefore, likely to withdraw a
powerful stimulus to clocks; but thfs will not
happen for months to come, many concerns
having on hand orders that will keep them
busy for the next Fix ; months earning large
profits. There are also other lines of industry
In which it is a question if 1901 proves as good
a year â¢ 15;!*. The textile trades have had
m. wonderfully fuccefsful season, but prudent
merchants are not overconfident, especially in
view of the great expar.Â£ion of the cotton in
dustry in the S'/Uth.
"Another Smjvirtarit element in the future Is
the money market. There is little prospect of
what we uFually term eÂ»f-y rates during the
present year. Trade is sure to be sufficiently
active to make good raus for money prac
tically certain. The thief question Is. shall
we expect undue stringency? Thtre Is enough
money available for all regular purposes, but
two disturbing factors must be facedâ the
Transvaal war and our own defective currency
eystem. As for the lirFt, it is quite evident
that Great Britain hiis a more perious under
tukir.r on !..;â¢.! than at first expected. I'nless
the I'-oers eurrender, which seems against all
probability. lhÂ» war may be prolonged for
months, necessitating no doubt a large issue
of consols, t-ytlmau-d at not lees than Â£10.000,
000 and f*-rhaps more. As this war will prove
b murh morÂ» expensive aflair than ours with
Fpaln. Its effect u;x>n the money markets of
the world will be 0.-rrepp^ndingly greater. For
the fame reapon our security markets will be
keenly sensitive to any battles or events which
promise to affect the duration of the struggle.
A Â«iecisive I?rltl*h victory will cause an ad
vance, or a Berious British reverse must cause
declines."

London Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London Financial cablegram says:
The markets here to-day were Idle almost
beyond precedent. Leading brokers Bald the
volume of business was the smallest In a
dozen years. The tendency was steady, all
the markets awaiting a solution of the prob
lem In the Transvaal. The settlement, as an
ticipated, disclosed a meager open account.
Contangoes began at the rates which prevailed
at the last settlement, but tenders were soon
unable to place the money. Bankers generally
charged 44(g5 per cent, but some were ready
to take 4 per cent.
The American account proved to be the small
est for several years. London bid up securi
ties In the American department $1 above par
ity on insignificant orders, but prices sagged eff
on New York sales. Gold to the amount of
Â£250,000 was withdrawn on Indian currency
account, and Â£50,000 was taken for South
America.
The bank bought Â£5000 gold. The week's
net inflow of specie was Â£601,000. Money was
easy at 2Â®24 per cent. The market confi
dently expects a reduction of the bank rate
to-morrow to 5 per ceat, unless politics Inter
vene.
The bullion on the way from New York and
Russia counteracts Argentine and Dutch de

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Jan. 10.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The wool market continues quiet, but Is very
firm, pending the general opening of the goods
market. Such goods as have been shown have
opened at advances ranging all the way from
15 to 40 per cent over last year and a satis
factory business is reported to have been done
thus far. Just at present the manufacturers
are not purchasing wool very- liberally although
they have been a little more In evidence the
past week and have taken some small lots of
medium wools and fine Australian. The entire
business of the week has been of a retail char
acter and the total sales aggregate only 2,565,
000 pounds. Prices continue to maintain much
strength and the trade are so confident as to
the future of wool that they have already con
tracted for a considerable portion of next sea
son's clip at prices ranging all the way from
60 to 73 cents clean landed at Boston.

New York Money Market.
A New York backer says: "The new year
opens up with the most favorable prospects.
It Is rare Indeed that the whole business situa
tion of any country Is In so satisfactory a con
dition as we find it here In the United States
to-day. The rallrca<iÂ» were never carrying bo
ir.uch tonnage, and that is a good Index to gen
eral prosperity. The war in South Africa is
not likely to seriously affect values In this
country a 6econd time as seriously as the re
cer.t one. Therefore I take it that the dis
turbance In the Transvaal has given us about
the worst. 6hock that. It is likely to do. We
have already shipped $14.525.O I .>O in gold, which
has done considerable good In London without
doing us any particular harm. As a matter of
tact we have derived considerable benefit by
having benefited the London money market by
the gold we have sent there, as our investment
securities have ceased now to be returned in
consequence. The holdings of our securities
In e;Â»eculatlve hands In London were probably
never smaller than they are Just now. So
there la nothing to fear from this one source
under any circumstances."

LIFE SENTENCE FOR
SULLIVAN, THE BURGLAR
No Clemency Shown Wilmore's Pal,
Who Shot Chief Conrad.
C. C. SULLIVAN. THE BURGLAR SENT
TO PRISON FOR LIFE.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cal',
90S Broadway. Jan. IV
C. C. Sullivan, the burglar, whose pal.
Bert Wlllmore, was killed by Chief Con
rad on the night of the A. O. Gott jewelry
store burglary in Alameda. last October,
was given a life sentence In the peniten
tiary to-day.
In pronouncing sentence Judge Hal'
made the remarkable declaration that he
"did not know, philosophically speaking,
that there is very much justification for
punishing people on this earth by the
hand of the law." The remark attracted
particular attention In view of the utter
ances of B. F. Albright, an Alamedan,
who had given as his reason for being ex
cused as a juror In the Serverra perjury
case, that he believed none but God should
sit in judgment on evil-doers, and that ifo
human hand should deal out punishment.
When Sullivan appeared for sentence,
his attorney, T. J. Crowley, promptly
moved for a new trial. This the court de
nied, as well as a motion in arrest of
judgment. Sullivan was then ordered to
stand up before the tribunal for sentence.
He stood unmoved.
Sullivan was orJgrnally .convicted of
murder In the second degree In Fresno
and sentenced to sixteen years, but Gov
ernor Budd pardoned him In December,

The boyish pirate is sad. He bewails the fate that has delivered him into
the hands of the law. He says he has been led into disgrace by evil associ
ates. If it had not been for the Importunities of companions he would have
remained his mother's little white-haired darling.
Stephen Potter does not deny that he enjoyed himself Immensely during
his piratical outing. The memory of boisterous nights and lazy, delightful
days lingers with him still, and with a sorrowful smile he relates his adven
tures.
"Us fellers had a great time," declared the kid pirate. "We wu/; Â£oin' v'
be market hunters an' make all kinds o' money. I was th' only one what
could sail th' boat, so they calls me captain. None o' 'em could hit th' side o'
Goat Island at low tide wid a gun and we didn't get no ducks, so we got
tired an* sold th' boat t' a feller in San Rafael.

NOT ONLY SEATS
BUT MORE WAGES
FOR SHOP GIRLS
Oakland Club Takes
Up Discussion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 10.
The ladles of the Oakland Club took
definite action to-day in the matter of the
seating of young women employed In
stores by adopting a resolution pledging
the promotion of home trading and in re
turn asking of the merchants better
wages for female employes, together with
the carrying out of the law that has as Its
purpose the securing of every possible
comfort for shop girls.
The Oakland Club took up this matter,
which was first made prominent by the
Mothers' Club of Golden Gate, at the re
quest of the latter organization, and acted
upon it without delay. At the meeting
this afternoon Mrs. Henrika Illohan, pres
ident of the Golden Gate club, spoke for
a few minutes on shop conditions. With
out any further discussion the following
resolution, Introduced by Mrs. ' Henry
Goodcell, was read and adopted:
Whereas, The wases paid to the employe
are dependent upon the financial success of
the employer, that In furthering the Interest
ot one the other should also be furthered,
therefore.
Resolved, That the Oakland Club pledges
itself to use its best endeavors to promote
home .trading and. In return, respectfully
requests the co-operation of the merchants
of Oukland In furtherlns the Interests of
the woirren in their employ; that they be
paid better wages and that the provisions
of the law for their protection, already
enacted, be fully carried out.
In connection with the subject of seat
ing women in stores, Mrs. Illohan
broached that of compulsory education,
and declared that the law relating to it
is not enforced strongly enough. The
crowded condition of the schools Is given
as an excuse for this non-enforcement,
the trustees being compelled to overlook
absences because there would be no place
to put the children if they should como.
Mrs. George W. Bunnell, president of
the Oakland Club, also spoke speclflcally
of the wage question.
In closing the talk on seating clerks,
Mrs. Iliohan said that if shoppers could
be comfortably seated before the counter,
surely the girls behind It should be, since
they are there and on their feet from 7
orB until <6 and often later. She was ap
plauded.
Mrs. John Bakewell and Mrs. Robert
Watt were unanimously elected as dele
gates to the convention that will meet In
Los Angeles next week to consider the
State federation of clubs. Since neither
of these ladles are active suffragists, .this
will take some color from the statement
that the suffragists of the Oakland Club
are leading the federation movement.
Several very instructive talks were
given during the afternoon. Mrs. Watt
spoke on domestic science and extended
general Invitation to the free demonstra
tions to-morrow afternoon at the school,
Fifth and Peralta streets. Miss Voorhies
spoke on cooking and cooking classes,
and Miss Emery on sewing. Mrs. M. L.
Curtis gave an interesting and spirited
Impromptu talk on servant-maids.
Resolutions of condolence were adopted
to be sent the family of Mrs. Touchard,
who lately died and who was a member
of the club. A letter of Invitation was
sent Mrs. T. B. Walker, founder of the
Bethlehem Home of â¢ Minneapolis, to be
present next Wednesday afternoon. Mrs.
Walker Is visiting In San Francisco. Miss
Morgan, president of the Oakland Sketch
Club, was given a rising vote of thanks
for the gift of a picture painted by her.
The Oakland Club will ask Mrs. Phebe
Hearst's interest in Its work, as they are
asking the interest of every woman.
Every department Is to be pushed for
ward as speedily as possible, as avenues
for good are opening everywhere to the
ladies.
The attendance was large to-day,
among those present being Mrs. Weaih
erby. Mrs. Barber. Miss Emery. Mrs. Cur
tis. Mrs. Huber. Miss Keene, Miss Mise
role. Mrs. Dixon, Mrs. George Flint. Mrs.

MANY TIPPLERS
AMONG WOMEN
OF HIGH DEGREE
Fashionable Patrons
of Drugstores.
OAKLAND, Jan. 10. â License Inspector
Henry Maloon declared before the Ordi
nance Committee of the City Council to
night that there were many tipplers
among the aristocratic ladies of Oakland.
He aaid that they secured their liquor*
from the drug stores, and that 1 some of
the latter establishments sold more liquor
than many of the saloons.
"I know what I am talking about when
I make the assertion." declared the In
spector. "I have made a thorough inves
tigation of the matter and am not giving
voice to any wild rumor. Every day you
can sec some (*t the wealthy women of
this town driving up to different c*rug
stores that make a specialty of selling
wine and whisky and getting bottles of
liquor."
"Do drug stores make a specialty of
selling liquors?" asked Councilman Taylor
in surprise.
"Do they!" exclaimed Inspector Maloon
in reply. "I should say they did. There
is one druggist on Seventh street who
sells as much liquor as any wholesale
liquor store in Oakland. Many of his cus
tomers are women, too."
"And there is a drug store in West Oak
land that is as bad as any saloon in
town," declared Councilman Stetson.
"The proprietor has a room In the rear,
where young fellows play . poker and
drink whisky until all hours of the
night."
As a result of these disclosures, a com
mittee composed of License Inspector Ma
loon. Councilman Glrard and City Attor
ney Dow was appointed to draft an ordi
nance which will be elTectual in stop
ping the traffic. It will be a stringent
one and will provide heavy penalties for
its violation. It was also decided to.im
pose a tine of $250 for breaches of the pro
posed new law prohibiting the sale of
liquors to boys under IS years of age.

GRAPE-NUTS.
TOO MUCH HONEY
Palls on the Palate.
A man ate a heaping saucer of
Grape-Nut* every morning because
they "tasted so Rood."
In about ten days he began to turn
aralnpt the food, and rinally lost the
pleasure of his favorite dish alto-
gether.
The same thing happens to a child
who eats too much honey or candy or
any other good thing The system gets
m<-<re than it needs and nature revolts,
in order to prevent further overfeeding.
Grape-Nuts furnish a rondensed food.
and vhen eaten in moderation give one
a delicious dish every morning that Is
looked forward to with pleasant antici-
pation. When not more than thr*^
heapinc teasi>ooris are used at a meal
the Kyptem quickly absorbs all of the
nutriment, and *he person discovers
th;* fact by his improved feeling of
health and strength. Use Grape-Nuts
eteadily, but avoid excess.

Committee on Foreign Relations to-day
began consideration of various treaties
now before the Senate. The first to be
considered was that with France, and
Reciprocity Commissioner Kasson was
heard in advocacy. The sessions are to
be absolutely executive and it was said
to-night that Kasson said the American
merchant under the proposed treaty had
such great advantages that French mer
chants would without doubt try to block
ratification if the facts were made public.
Among the callers on President Mc-
Kinley to-day was Alfred S. Hartwell,
who represents the existing Government
in Hawaii. He presented to the Presi
dent a statement of the public land sys
tem of the islands from its Inception to

pared by President Dole at the request
of the Government, owing to contention
as to land grants. Attorney General
Griggs recently decided that under the
Newlands resolution Hawaiian officials
had no authority to dispose of public
lands. This decision holds good until Con
gress again acts.
Hartwell said to-day that the present
land laws "were designed to keep the pub

ALBRIGHT MISREADS BIBLE.
Ministers Disagree With His Contention
That Man Should Not Punish Man.
If B. F. Albright of Alameda had his way all courts upon this
earth would be abolished and no human being would be permitted to sit
in judgment upon his fellow-man. Judge Ogden, to whom Albright
made these statements on Tuesday, expressed his disapproval of the
views of the man from Alameda, and a canvass of the ministers shows
no supporters of his views, even in that section.
THE JUDGE ON ALBRIGHT.
ALBRIGHT ON THE JUDGE.
"The carrying out of Mr. Albright's
Ideas would simply mean anarchy on this
earth. His case is the strangest that ever
came before me. I have had many jurors
seek to be excused because of religious
views and many have offered strange rea
sons, but none have equaled those of Mr.
Albright. If Albright's Idea that God
should attend to the punishment of all
law-breakers prevailed It would mean that
murder or arson would go unpunished until
the offender meets his God. I can only
come to the conclusion that Albright has
misunderstood the Scriptures In his read-
Ing and study.
"The claim that Albright's spiritual
growth has been no great that he cannot
sit In Judgment upon his fellow-man does
not Indicate a ypiritual growth. Religious
men generally make good jurors, but they
must not entertain the Idea that crime
cannot be put down by Judgment."
"I believe that no man, woman or child
should be punished by human hands for
wrong-doing or for what we call crime.
Gcd alone can Judge the doing cf thoa?
to whom He has given life. Punishment
Is barbarous and should be abolished. I
have arrived at these conclusions after
studying the Bible for two years with
the Home of Truth Society, and I merely
expressed my opinions to Judge Osjden.
"I served on a jury before Judge Ogrlen
two years ago. and at that time was
willing to sit In judgment upon my fel
low-man, but since that time I have soen
the error nf my way*. I will no longer
be one who will pass my Judgment as
against that of the Creator, and I cannot
ai*l will not assume functions that belonx
only trÂ» Him. Under those circumstances
I could not nit cÂ« a Jury and I told Judge
Ogden plainly my beliefs."
. The ministers of Oakland do not agree with Mr. Albright In his unique
' stand, and the Bible scholars of Oakland do not see the force of his con
, elusions. These are a few opinions:
REV. ROBERT F. COYLE, First Presbyterian Churchâ Outside of the
> passage in the Bible, "Judge not lest ye be judged," there i 3 nothing that
could be construed as supporting the views expressed by Mr. Albright. If
1 that is the passage upon which he bases his views he has sadly misln
p terpreted its meaning. That passage Is simply directed against the hasty
judgment of one person by another. The Bible supports law and order,
i I do not criticize Mr. Albright, but merely say that he is mistaken in
his views.
1 REV. J. K. McLEAN, president of the Pacific Theological Seminaryâ l
would not say with Judge Ogden that the juror's creed was the creed of
' anarchy, but .1 would certainly say that it tended in that direction. We
, would have no law and order without our courts, and I know of nothing
better for the protection of the people than our jury system. It is the
â¢ duty of every citizen to sit as a juror when so summoned.
FATHER McSWEENEY. St. Francis de Sales Churchâ Pope, the writer.
1 has said, "A little learning is a davs-rous thing," and this is particularly ro
, when one begins the interpretation of the Scriptures. I agree with what Judge
Ogden has said, for without our courts there would be neither law nor order.
, ,In many parts of the Scriptures there are frequent mention of Judges. Ono
passage says: "And charging the judges he said. Take heed what you do.
1 for you exercise not the judgment of man, but of God. and whatsoever ycu
Judge it shall redound unto you.' "
1 : REV. E. R. DILLE, First Methoiist Churchâ l do not consider the matter
seriously, for the man who made the statements must have been suffering
1 from a mental twist. I will only say that the Bible abounds In recognition
i ol! human judgment.
REV. FATHER KING, the Church of the Immaculate Conceptionâ A
1 great deal of foolishness is apt to arise from mistaken study of the Bible.
There is no merit in fanaticism, an 1 this poor man Is evidently very much
muddled in his theology.
, REV. ROBERT RITCHIE, rector of St. Paul's Churchâ lt Is a man's pre
rogative to Judge his fellows on this earth when they are accused. There
. is no other way In which justice can be maintained. Â«. ',. â
REV C H HOBART. First B.'-.ptist Churchâ The stand taken by Mr. Al
i bright is merely a misconception of the Scriptures.
ROSENBERG IS ACQUITTED
IN SHORT ORDER
Trial Over the Crap Game Farcical
in the Extreme.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Jan. 10.
The trial of Joe Rosenberg, the saloon
keeper and cigar dealer, charged with
permitting a gambling game to be run in
his place on Broadway, enried in a verit
able farce and acquittal to-night. Cap
tain Petersen and Officer Pardee. who,
with Sergeant McKinley. raided the place,
testified that Rosenberg was present in
his place when the game of "craps" was
in progress there. When they called on
Rosenberg to open the place he came to
the front door and then called back to
those inside, "Close up. â¢ there." Rosen
berg made a pretense of trying to unlock
the front door, but claimed he had the
wrong key and went to the rear again.
He finally opened the door and the ar
rests were made.
Rosenberg testified in his own behalf.
He did not deny that a game had been
going on in his place, but claimed he had
no knowledge of it. He testified that the
back rooms were run by Sig. Richard
son. Numerous witnesses testified as to
defendant's fair character and reputa
tion. Of these latter Prosecutor Abe
Leach in his argument declared several
needed vouchers for their own charac
ters. He vividly pictured the pitfall at
Rosenberg's place, and implored the Ju
rors to uphold law and order by bringing
a verdict of guilty against the defend
ant.
In his Instructions to the jury Police
Judge Smith enunciated with some gusto
the fact that "craps" is not enumerated
In the statutes as a. banking game and
that the jury, in order to convict, must
find that a banking game was In opera-
The Jury was out Just fifteen minutes
and brought in a verdict of "not guilty."
The lury" consisted of W. A. Young. F.
W Moore. C. F. Murdoek. -Tames King.
S.K. Irish. J. D. Riker. G. Duddy. Mike
Hallihan and T. Wyckoff.
But long before the verdict was reached
the defendant left the courtroom and en
tertained friends in a neighboring saloon,
asking some of them to clap their hands
when the verdict should be announced.
In the City Council to-night Stetson in
troduced a resolution to revoke Rosen
berg's liquor license, but action was held
in abeyance until the next meeting.
RICH SQUATTERS
IN POSSESSION
OF CITY'S LAND
Appropriate Shores of
Lake Merritt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
903 Broadway, Jan. 10.
The declaration was made in a Council
committee to-night that the city had been
systematically robbed of thousands of dol
lars' worth of public property by aristo
cratic land-grabbers along the shores of
Lake Merritt. A resolution vaa favora
bly acted upon, directing the City En
gineer to determine the boundary line of
the land along the water front belonging
to Oakland, and a's soon as this is dor.-,
legal measures will be taken to oust tl: j
squatters.
"On a rough estimate 1 will venture to
say that there has been over J7S.UU) worth
of realty belonging to the city gobbled up
along the shores of Lake Merritt," saltl
Councilman Taylor. "Two long arms oC
the lake were filled in several years ag<.Â»
and as soon as the work was completed,
private individuals stepped into posses
sion and claimed it. They had not the
least shadow of a title, yet their asser
tions and acts of ownership have never
been disputed. Other property owner j
along the shores of the lake have also en
croached upon city property that was or
iginally dedicated for park purposes, and
unless the city takes prompt and vigor
ous action all of this valuable ground will
be lost.
"I have been examining the survey nf
the property belonging to Oakland in that
vicinity and I find that in some instance*
magnificent houses have been erected oa
some parts of It. and the occupants, who
are prominent citizens, claim that they
own the land. This is practically a theft
of the city's property, and I intend to see
that every squatter Is ousted.
'Until the city line is definitely set
forth by the establishment of monuments
I do not care to mention the names of
any of these men who have grabbed the
public lands, but It will only be a short
time before the matter is definitely and
conclusively shown."

OAKLAND'S KID PIRATE
BEWAILS HIS SAD FATE
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 11, 1000.
FAT HER YORKE
COMPARED TO AN
IRISH PATRIOT
Likened to O'Connell
by Father Casey.
Rev. Father r. S. Casey of St. Peter's
Church was tendered a reception last
evening, the memory of which will long
remind him of the tender verse on the
vase and the roses. Worn out by years of
unremitting toil in the Interest of Him
whom he serves, the priest found it neces
sary to take a year's vacation, and on the
eve of his departure, which will take
place next Tuesday evening, his parish
loners gave him a reception and testimo
nial in St. Peter's Hall, corner of Twenty
fourth and Alabama streets.
The programme consisted of an over
ture by the Misses Clara Isabel and Edith
'formey, a song by Master Bert Flynn of
St. Peter's Hoys' School, an address by
Master Michael Harron of the same in
stitution, a grand chorus by the Young
Indies' Sodauty, Irish airs by the orches
tra of St. Peter's Academy: "Till We
Meet Again." by St. Peter's Choral, and
an address by P. J. Tormey.
In his address Mr. Toriney dwelt at
length on the good work done by thfi
priest In his pastorate of more than twen
ty years and especially on his educational
work amxng the ynimg. He ailuikvi to the
beautiful church whk-n had rewarded the
priest for his endeavors and expressed re
gret for the illness which made his ab
sence a necessity, remarking in conclusion
that it was the earnest desire of all that
the priest should enjoy himself on his va
cation and return refreshed both in mind
and body.
In reply Father Casey stated that, like
the man who remarked to O'Connell, the
great Irish patriot, after the lawyer hail
saved him from being convicted of sheep
stealing: "I never knew I was so honest
before until I heard you talk," he never
knew that he had done so many good
things before until he heard Mr. Tormey
talk. He expressed his gratitude to his
parishioners tor the evidence of their good
will and said that without their hearty
co-operation what he had accomplished
would have been an impossibility.
"Father Yorke will fill the pulpit of St.
Peter's while I am away," he added, "and
I regard him as bearing the same rela
tion to the people of this city as O'Con
nell did to the Irish people. No doubt
your spiritual needs will be well attended
to while I am absent and as for myself
1 shall pray for my people at every shrine
I shall visit. I shall spend my vacation
principally in Treland. the land of my
birth, and shall visit the holy land, with
a probability of going to Rome."
Father Casey was tendered a check for
a handsome sum in the way of a testi
monial and when the reception was past
his parishioners all waited to shake him
by the hand.
The following priests were present on
the occasion: Rev. Fathers P. R. Lyncn,
P. Griffin and D McKinnon of St. Janios,
M. D. Connolly of St. Paul's. James Mc-
Donald of St. Charles. James Grant and
William Lyons of St. Peter's, T. Phillips
of San Rafael, and J. Cassin of Santa
Rosa; Rev. Dr. Morrison of St. Man's,
Oakland, and Rev. Fathers P. C. Yorke
and T. I,arkin.
The committee of arrangements was
composed of P. J. Tormey. chairman; D.
J. Keefe. treasurer; Kugene Sullivan, sec
retary; Thomas Slevin. Richard Curtis,
Peter Curtis and John Kenny.

11BLYTHE ESTATE
HAS BORROWED
$1,000,000
Money Raised to Pay
Pressing Claims.
On* million dollars In cash has passed
into the hands of Mrs. Florence Blythe-
Hlnckley-Moore and her husband, for the
loan of which they have given a mortgage
on nearly all of the Blythe estate in this
city.
A mortgage was recorded last evening
at the City Hall by the terms of which
the United States Mortgage and Trust
Company of New York loaned $1,000,000
to Mr. and Mrs. Atoore, taking as security
all the land originally owned by the late
Thomas H. Blythe with the piece pur
chased last week by the Mutual Savings
Bank. The document required war rev
enue stamps to the amount of $500.
The floating of. the loan is the continua
tion of the plan outlined by Mr. and Mrs.
A. A. Moore and their attorneys several
weeks ago. It was then decided to raisy
enough money by mortgage to pay oft all
the claims and minor mortgages against
the estate and to improve that portion of
the property which it was considered de
sirable not to sell outright. The money
Just received by Mrs. Moore will be used
to pay all the attorneys who have claims
against the estate, to eettle all compro
mises and to pay all other outstanding
Indebtedness.
Simultaneously with the filing of the
mortgage there was also recorded an at
tachment against tha property for $25,000
on behalf of the Tevis estate. This amount
is claimed by the Tevis heirs on a note
held by the estate, but the validity of
which has never been admitted by the
Blythe estate or determined In court It
was filed by the Tevis , heirs to protect
their rights and will ultimately be dis
posed of in the courts unless a compro
mise should be effected.
The legal work connected with the big
transfers and mortgage of J the . Blythe
property has been transacted by Attor
neys Gunnison. Booth & Bartnett. ."Big
Improvements will at once be commenced
by Mr. and Mrs. Moore," said Attorney
Bartnett yesterday. "The property lying
east of Brook street, which is the little
alley running from Market to Geary street,
will be sold and the ready money now in
the hands of the heir will be used. to im
prove the property between the alley and
Grant avenue. This section of the prop
erty will not be disposed of, but the
Moores will erect some buildings that
will bÂ© a credit to the center of the city."

COLONY WILL PROBABLY
MOVE INTO THIS STATE
OBJECT THAT HAS BROUGHT
THREE RUSSIANS HERE.
As was predicted by The Call, the ob
ject of the visit of the three distinguished
Russians who registered at the Russ
House Tuesday has turned out to be a
colonization scheme, and one of consider
able magnitude at that,
i At Assinibone, Canada, there Is located
a colony of between 7000 and 8000 Rus
slons who emigrated there for the purposa
of entering into agricultural pursuits. The
land was sold to them by the Canadian
Pacific Railway, and, at the time they
bought It, It was represented as being
splendidly adapted to the usages to which
they intended putting It. The colonists
have since discovered that It thaws to
only about four feet below the surface
and consequently Is absolutely worthless
for farming when compared to the more
fertile soil that lies under the milder Cal
ifornia skies.
Mr. Bodyansky and his two companions
have been delegated by the colony to act
as its agents, travel through Oregon and
California, and look for some spot more
suited to their needs. . This is the reason
of their coming here; this is the reason
that sent them off yesterday on a tour
of the southern part of the State, and thiq
Is the reason they have been shown tfo
much attention by W. H. Mills, who is
trying to hand them a little of the big cor
poration's surplus land at so much per
acre.
At Chico, on their way down to this
city, the party was met by General and
Mrs. Bidwell. who drove them over the
Rancho Chico. Eight thousand acres of
this ranch are for sale, and despite the
water with which It was covered, it im
pressed the Russians very favorably.
The party will be gone a week or ten
days on their tour of inspection of South
ern California, and will return to this city
before proceeding home.

HOTEL NYMPHIA
IS RAIDED BY
SIXTY POLICE
Thirty-three Women
Arrested.
GAMBLERS TAKEN PRISONERS
ACTING CHIEF BIGGY LEADS
SQUAD TO CHINATOWN.
Acting Chief of Police Biggy at the head
of eleven sergeants and over sixty offi
cers raided gambling and opium joints
and highbinder dens, in Chinatown, and
the Hotel Nymphia last night. Doors,
which secluded wily fan-tan players from
public view, fell under the blows of heavy
hammers; fiends were aroused from their
poppy slumbers, women hustled out of
houses of 111-fame and three patrol
wagons kept busy transferring prisoners
to the Central and California Btreet po
lice stations.
At exactly 8 o'clock twenty 6quada of
three men each descended upon as many
heathen gambling Joints and forced an
entrance to the places. An attempt was
made to take the occupants of the dens
by surprise and the formalities of solicit
ing admission were dispensed with. Each
Bquad was armed with sledges, Jimmies
and bars and in a few seconds of time the
heavy French locks with which the doors
are secured were smashed and the offi
cers had rushed into the gambling apart
ments. In most cases the Chinese had
opportunity of disposing of incriminating
evidence by dumping the beans and chips
into large sewers prepared for that pur-,
pose, but a few of the places were cap
tured with the entire paraphernalia of the
game in use by the players. Altogether
about fifty Chinese were arrested for vis
iting gambling houses and locked up In
the California-street Station.
Chinatown . became wild with excite
ment. Hundreds of Chinamen scudded
to and fro and thousands congregated
about the places In which the police were
operating. A large squad of extra po
lice wa? called to keep the mobs In check.
Chief Biggy passed from one place to
another and directed where arrests
should be made. After he had finished
the gambling houses he raided the opium
dens and the highbinder headquarters.
At places where opium Is sold white
fiends as well as. Chinamen were sur
prised and hustled into the street. A cou
ple of hours were spent in searching the
headquarters of the Suey Sing Tong, one
of the factions in the highbinder war, on
Jackson street, near Kearny, in quest of
weapons which were supposed to have
been concealed there. The officers were
rewarded by recovering a number of
knives, pistols and other deadly weapons.
OLD OOM JOE'S
BOER FLAG IS
STILL FLUNG
An Admirer's Deed
Rewarded.
BIG CROWD WELL DRENCHED
?
BOYS MAKE A "BOUGH STBEET"
SOUTH OF THE SLOT.
"Hail, Britannia, Rule the Waves r
A patriotic Britisher, reeling about
three sheets to the windward under the
potent Influence of John Barleycorn,
burst Into that song last evening as he
was passing the corner of Tenth and Har
rison streets. Five words were all he ut
tered. He had more In his vocabulary,
but there came a rude interruption.
Glancing upward toward the pale orb
of night the patriotic Britisher saw some
thing that made him rub his eyes as if
emerging from a troubled sleep. He look
ed again. He was not mistakenâ floating
to the breeze was a Boer flag. The Eng
lishman limbered up and went Into ac
tion. Shinning up the- flagpole with the
agility of a tar, ho grabbed hold of the
wire and tore It from Its fastenings. In
two minutes' time there was a "rough
street" in that vicinity that will in future
generations be pointed to with satisfac
tion by the loquacious oldtlmer.
On Tenth street, near Harrison, a shoe
maker named Joseph Skelton keeps a lit
tle shop. He is an Englishman, born and
bred. Last Saturday evening he was in
duced to attend the pro-Boer mass meet
ing at Metropolitan Temple, and since
then he swears by Oom Paul and all his
hosts. His was the Boer tlag, strung on
a wire, between his place of business and
a telegraph pole on the opposite corner,
near James McDermott's butcher shop,
and In order to testify further to the
pride the old man takes in "turning
down" the land of his birth, he has placed
a small sign over his door, with the in
scription "Oom Joe." By that namo he
is known to everybody In the neighbor
hood.
Skelton was away from home when the
flag came down, and reached the scene
Just In time to witness pandemonium.
The other Britisher had Just reached the
ground and started a paean of victory
when- he was pounced upon by half a
hundred jyoung boys, who banged him
about with a will. He was a fighter, and
the youngsters were falling right and
left when an adult or two took a hand
out of a pure desire for fun, and some
body blew a police whistle.
Just at this stage of the proceedings
"Oom Joe" reached the scene. He saw a
surging, scuffling crowd and his flag on
the ground. He didn't stop to think twice.
In his mind the crowd was associated
with the downfall of the flag of the little
South African republic and he Intended
to make somebody suffer. :
Running into the house he filled two
large buckets with water, and climbing
to the roof emptied one of them on the
crowd. Before the dripping and aston
ished victims could make another move
the second bucketful was dumped out
over them. Then there was a scattering
and in the confusion the escalading Brit
isher escaped without leaving his name
or street number. A sergeant of police
reached the corner In time to learn what
had happened. Skelton was permitted to
restore the flag to Its place without moles
tation.
"Oom Joe" Is etlll a hero, ' despite his
error, and the affair has furnished, the
neighborhood with plenty of food for hu
morous gossip.
The New Hartford Leaving Port on Her First Cruise.
In the same place deadly explosives were
found Tuesday night.
The Hotel Nymphia was then raided
and thirty-three women transferred to the
Central police station, where a charge of
vagrancy was placed against each. Biggy
has had officers on the premises for the
past week securing evidence, and the raid
was carefully planned. No resistance was
offered.
The names of the women under arrest
are: Lillian Dale, the landlady; Beulah
Williams. Dora Bell. Edna Roberts, May
Bell, Laura White, Fannie Wilson, Carrie
Dewey, Lillian Forest, May Russell, Kit
tle Rodgers, Freda Belmont, Nellie Held,
Dollle Ford, Carrie Thomas, Minnie Mc-
Laughlin, May Francis, May Allen, Lulu
Lockwood, Elsie Woods, Sadie McGowan,
Nellie Woods. Millfe Gabrielle, Millie
Blanche, Margaret Morgan, May Adams,
Addle Wilson. Ada Lemar, Mabel Morino,
May Smith, Gladys Lenard, Renle Adams,
Mirth Wilson and two Japanese women.
It is Biggy's intention to place two
squads in Chinatown permanently. For a
time he will continue to enter the houses
and keep them open so that no gambling
games can be conducted and a large de
tail of officers will be kept for that pur
ppse. The Hotel Nymphia will be raided
every eight and each occupant arrested.
The tong affairs are quiet. The settle
ment effected yesterday .still holds and It
is the opinion of many leading tong men
that peace reigns for all time between
the warring companies over the present
trouble. The police will, however, be
cautious and will not relax their vigilance
for some time. The Consul General de
nies that he was a wftness to the signing
of any articles of peace, which, by the
way, were. verbal and not written. The
arbitration committee will meet soon and
Its duty will be to settle upon an amount
of money to be paid by the Suey Sings to
the Hop Sings in compensation for the
men they lost while the trouble lasted.
Whether the Hop Sings will consent to
any monetary adjustment is still a mat
ter of conjecture.

EXTBEUE CRUELTY.
â¢ Til ar.d unable to labor to sustain her
self and babies, Mrs. Evangeline Hap
jpcrsberger, wife of the sculptor whose
Igenlus produced the commemorative stat
uary group in City Hall Square, has filed
an application in the Superior Court for
Â¦alimony, pendente lite, In the sum of $230
Â¦i>. month.
A few weeks ago Mrs. Happersberger
Sled suit for divorce from her husband,
alleging willful neglect ac cause of ac
tion. Her husband retaliated by filing a
cross-complaint, charging her with infi
delity, following this by filing suit to re
voke a power of attorney he had given
Mrs. Happersberger, empowering her to
Bell the lamily Homestead and take pos
session of the proceeds.
In her affidavit accompanying the peti
tion for alimony. Mrs. Happersberger
alleges that during less than nine
years last past he has earned as
xhe emoluments of his art a Bum
tcxceeding $150,000. Continuing, she
alleges that after filing her suit for dl
â¢voree on the jrround of willful neglect he
appeared and. after denying her allega^
tions. made a cross-complaint, in which
he charged her with infidelity. This
charge, the says, in actuated by malice
and was made by the defendant with
out reasonable cause, ar.d is absolutely
ialse In letter and spirit and in general.
She pays also tliat the charge was not
made in good faith, but for the sole pur
â¢pofe of injuring her good name and repu-
Xation and to hurt her feelings.
Mrs. Hajipertberger next charges A. K.
Happersberger. her husband's attorney in
â¢fact, with naving verilied the complaint
\rtthout htr husband's knowledge or con
cent. She says that she was informed
iy her attorney. Hvn B. Hasktil, and be
lieves that en January 5, at the office of
2Jartln Stevens, attorney for the defend
ant. Haskell demanded of Stevens to
know upon what alleged Information the
charge was made and whether it was pre
ferred at the direction of the defendant
or at the direction of A. K. Happersber
ger without the defendant's consent, but
Stevens refused to give any information
and refused to state whether or not the
defendant sanctioned the filing of the
charge of intidelity againÃt the wife.
Here Mrs. liapptrsberger's affidavit be
flns to gex. warm. Before commencing
er suit for divorce, she says, she ex
plained all of her marital relations with
the defendant to her attorney and was
advised by him that she had grounds of
action for divorce against him upon the
several grounds of willful neglect and ex
treme cruelty.
"Owing: to the revolting: details of my
husband's conduct toward me." she says,
"and for the sake of the children, to preÂ»
vent public scandal and also to the fact
that prior to defendant's departure for
Jv'ew York he advised me that I was en
titled to a divorce on the ground of will
ful neglect, and under the advice of coun
sel 1 nude but the one allegation â neglect.
"Since the tiling of the cross-complaint
charjrlng me with the Infamous crime of
adultery, and for my own honor and pro
tection and to Insure the granting of a
divorce, I can no longer shield the defend
ant by remaining silent as to bis cruel
conduct toward me, and hence I will file
an amended comp'.aint and incorporate
the allegation of cruelty."

NEW HARTFORD
STARTS ON HER
MAIDEN CRUISE
Rejuvenated Warship
Is Handsome.
MAILBOAT AUSTRALIA SAILS
THE AZTEC A2JT) TARTAR GET
AWAY FOR MANILA.
Bright sunshine and the departure of a
number of large vessels drew a crowd of
gayly dressed women to the front yester
day. The Oceanic wharf was crowded
with them Just prior to the sailing of the
Australia for Honolulu, Harrison street
wharf carried a large contingent of those
eager to see the rejuvenated Hartford
start on her voyage to New York, others
were down to see their friends away on
the transports Aztec and Tartar, while
numbers went to the Mall dock to have
a look at the big tramp steamer Algoa,
The first of the fleet to get away was
the Hartford. Early in the morning she
finished taking In stores and it was an
nounced that she would sail at 10 a. m.
She could not be got ready by that hour,
but at 1 p. m. the anchor was got In and
the vessel was headed for the Golden
Gate. During her etay in port the Hart
ford used the Marion's steam launch and
the boat was returned shortly after noon.
When the men who manned the launch
got back aboard the warship was at once
got ready for sea. She will go on a short
cruise outside to test her engines, and If
everything is found to be satisfactory she
will not come back to port, but will pro
ceed direct to Valparaiso. She will re
main some time in the Chilean port and
will then proceed to New York via the
Straits of Magellan. Stops will be made
at Montevideo and other ports on the At
lantic, and it will probably be some time
in April before the Hartford reaches Nerw
York.
The Mall steamer Australia followed the
Hartford out to sea. She was delayed a
short time In the stream, as two of the
passengers got left and had to be put
aboard by a tug. Once they were aboard
it did not take Captain Lawless long to
get his vessel under way again. The Aus
tralia took away every, ounce of freight
she could pack and the following cabin
passengers: J. Alexander, A. W. Ander
son, wife, two children and servant, Mrs.
M. Babcock, A. H. Bachelder, H. A. Bald
win, W. H. Barney and wife, W. A.
Bowen, H. C. Brown and wife, W. A.

S. Tuithoff and Dr. R. J. Wilkinson.
James Rolph Jr. of the firm of Hurd.
Rolph & Co. also went down on the Aus
tralia. He goes to look after the wreck
of the barkentine William Carson, his
firm being the managing owner of the
vessel. Mr. Rolph only made up his mind
to go to Honolulu at the last moment and
had to hustle to get away. He hopes to
find on his arrival that the barkentine is
not as much damaged as was reported
and that he will be able to get her fixed
up and into commission again.
The horse transport Aztec sailed about
an hour after the Australia, while the
Tartar did not get away until late. The
Aztec goes to Hllo to unload her horses,
on account of the plague scare in Hono
lulu. Captain Mattson of the four-masted
bark Falls of Clyde went out on the Aztec
as pilot. He only arrived from Hilo a few
days ago, and as he knows the port well
he will be of great assistance to the offi
cers of the Aztec in getting the horses
and mules ashore and then back aboard
again.
The Tartar took away a number of re
cruits, some hospital nurses and a full
cargo of supplies for General Otis and the
soldiers in Manila. Two of the officers
missed the vessel and had to hire a tug
to put them aboard in the stream. ! They
had their rush for nothing, as the vessel
anchored In the stream and did not sail
until early this morning.
The many friends of Captain Caw In San
Francisco and Oakland will be sorry to
hear that he died last month while on
his way home to England. Captain Caw
was In command of the British bark
Blairmore when that vessel capsized In
the harbor. During the time the vessel
was being raised and while the litigation
over the, insurance was going on Captain
CaiÂ» made his home here. When the
matter was settled he went back to Eng
land, and a few months ago he was given
command of the ship Arranmore. He
I went to Iqulque In her with a load of. coal
and. while there was taken sick. His 111â
[ness became serious and. the doctors or-
dered him home by steamer. During the
voyage he died.
Eight students from Stanford Univer
sity put in an appearance on the front
yesterday and announced their willing
ness to assist Chief Engineer Howard
Holmes of the Harbor Commission in tak
ing soundings and getting all necessary
information about the new site for fish
ermen's cove at North Beach. â¢ A large
ship's boat was procured .and Quarter
master William Thompson of the Mall
Company went along as. captain. "With
him was Thomas Danahy. the Harbor
Commissioners' boat builder, and James
Cunningham, the boatman. There was
quite a little sea on at the time of em
barkation and seven out of the eight
students got cold feet. The one who
braved the terrors of a voyage from Clay
street wharf to Meiggs wharf said he
had a pleasant time. The seven walked
the distance through a sea of mud and
did not enjoy the trip quite as well as
the other. All of the eight, however,
learned something by yesterday's expe
rience.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day and discussed the plans for the new
Santa Fe wharf at Alain street. After
the board adjourned the Commissioners,
accompanied by Chief Engineer Holmes,
went down Main street and looked
the ground over. The plans were ap
proved finally and the work of petting
the wharf ready for the railroad will be
gin at once.
Some of the smartest stevedoring work
ever seen in this port was done on the
big transport Algoa yesterday. More
than 2500 tons of cargo was taken out
during the day and the work is still go
ing on. The matting alone that has been
taken out of the big tramp will fill 100
cars. To-day the Algoa will move to the
seawall, as there is no more room on the
Mail dock for freight.
