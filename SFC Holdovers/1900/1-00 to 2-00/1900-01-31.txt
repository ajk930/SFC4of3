LEGISLATURE AND THE
MILITIA ALMOST CLASH
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 30.â A clash between the members of the
Legislature and the militia was narrowly averted to-night. The rumor was
carried to the office of the adjutant general that the Democratic mem
bers had decided to hold a night session in the opera-house to receive the
report of the contesting board, declare Goebel Governor and seize the
State government. .No such thing was contemplated, although it had
been discussed by different members of the House. When word was re
ceived by the militia officers it was determined to break up the meeting,
"the assembly" was sounded and the troops formed for a march to the
opera-hou6e. They had reached the south gate of the Capitol grounds
when word was brought that no meeting was to be held, antf the soldiers
returned to their quarters.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 30.
Tbe crisis b as come in tbe United States Senatorial situation. The
forces opposed to the election of D. M. Burns rjave forced upon hin) a
caucus, in which he ri)ust face fifty votes pledged in antagonism to rjim.
fit tbe regular session fifty-five Republicans stood invincible in tbeir de
fense of the good name of the State and of their personal honor. Â£1
great prize â the integrity of California â was at stake, and tbe issue fyas
QOt cbanged in a year. The same evil influences are to be con)bated
and the struggle is being roade by tbe same n)en.
During this year the skin of Dan Burns is not changed. He bas
not softened the stains of a dishonest private life nor the dishonor of a
corrupt public career. He is no less an embezzler and defaulter now
than be was then. h\e is no less a type of all that is discreditable in pub
lic life now tban he was then, and the newspapers of the State are
sounding tbe alarm to warn all decent njen of the roenace of bis auda
cious campaign hje has received no new strength and again be must
be crushed by tbe blows of honest roen.
One year ago fifty-five men in the State Legislature could not rec
oncilotheir principles of honesty and their hope of an honorablejuture
with a vote for Dan Burns. Nor can they do so now, and they will know,
as the State must know, that if they falter or fail in the great battle be
fore them only one cause can accomplish their undoing â bribery in its
lowest, most contemptible form â a bribery by coin that will forever brand
the faltering ones as men that had been bought with money, and that
money supplied by the Southern Pacific Company. Not one of these
fifty-five Republicans can dare to accept this judgment of betrayal, yet it
is the only judgment that can be made and which will be made to point a
derelict to a future worse than oblivion.

From the outer efige of the Capitol

this had been passed and the men were
â¢walking slowly, when suddenly a shot
rang out from a large three-story building
which stands fifty feet east of the Capitol

by nearly all the leading "officials of the

who was supported by Chirm. who had his
arms about him almost as soon as he
touched the pavement.
"Get help." said Chirm to LUiard; and,
turning to Goebel, he asked:
"ArÂ© you hurt. Goebel: did they get
you?"
"They have got me this time," replied
Mr. Goebel. "I guess they have killed
me."
In less than a minute a crowd of men
vaj around Goebel. He was losing much
bl'Â»od and was becoming very weak. H*
was hastily carried to the office of Dr. E.
JZ. Hume, In the basement of the Capitol
Hotel and about 1000 feÂ©t away from the
bpot* where the snooting occurred. Here"
he was laid on a sofa while Dr. Hume
made a hasty examinaton, pronouncing
the wound to be of a nature that must
cause death in a short time. Mr. Goebel,
who showed great fortitude and courage
throughout, smiled weakly as he heard
thÂ© verdict and feebly rolled his head
from side to side in token of dissent from
the opinion expressed by the physician.
He was then carried to his room on the
second floor of the Capitol Hotel and in
addition to Dr. Hume Drs. McCormick
and Ely were summoned to attend him.
After a careful examination of the wound
the doctors announced that while exceed
ingly dangerous it was not necessarily
fa.La.l unless complications â¢or blood-poi
soning should set in. ' The patient himself
kept up his courage; insisting again and
again that he was not going to die.
It was decided by his friends to call
In the services also of Dr. McMurty, a
prominent eurgeon of Louisville, and
urgent messages were at once sent for
him. After the wound had been dressed
Senator Goebel Phowed great exhaustion
and it was announced by the physicians
that he would In all probability die with
in a short time. He rallied, however, and
under the influence of an opiate sank into
a gentle slumber which lasted several
hours.
The bullet which struck Goebel was
fired from a window in the center of the
three-s>tory office building just east of the
Capitol. That window was raised about
eight inches from the sill to permit an
unobstructed passage for the bullet when
Goebel should come within rangÂ». Both
Chirm and Llllard assert that while the
first shot came from the direction of the
window in the third story thero were
other shots fired from different portions
of the same building. Some of those who
heard the shots say that at least one shot
was flred from the office of the Secretary
of State. This, however, is not true, as
there were men In the office of the Sec
retary of State who rushed to the window
as soon as the shots were heard and all
of them declare that there was.no shot
flred a.t all from that part of the building.'
The window in the third story waa left
open, no effort having been made to close
it by the would-be assassin, while not
another window in the buildinr was
opened, nor were there any places where
bullets had been fired through them.
Whittaker was arrested as he came
down the steps on the east side of the
State Office building, directly below the
window from which the shots had been
fired. He reached the sidewalk and was

escape, knowing well that the slightest
attempt to do so would have brought a
dozen bullets into his body. He submitted
quietly to a search which was quickly
made of his clothing, the proceeds being
three revolvers and a big knife. A
quick examination of the revolvers showed
none of the cartridges had been used and
there was no powder smut on any of his
weapons, proving conclusively that he
could not have used any of his three re
volvers. In addition to this, all those who
heard the shots join in the statement that
they were from a rifle and from a smaller
weapon.'
Whittaker was quickly led away and
placed in Jail, while a guard was placed
at the outer entrance to keep out all peo
ple who had no connection with the insti
tution.
The prisoner is a man slightly over the
medium size, with sandy hair and mous
tache. He was disposed to take things
calmly, although he repeated again and
again that he knew nothing whatever
about the shooting.
"I was on the first floor of the building,"
ho t.aid, "when I heard Governor Taylor
tell that man Davis, the Capitol policeman,
to go over at once to see General Collier.
I said I would go with him and that was
where I was going. I wanted to know,
too, what the shooting was about. When
I stepped outside that man grabbed me
and that is all 1 know about it, and that
is a fact."
Few people bellevÂ© Whittaker is guilty,
but the fact that he was hastily leaving
the building from which the shooting was
done Is enough to cast suspicion on him.
"That mail Davis," to whom Whittaker
referred, is Colonel John Davis, the cus
todian of the Capitol grounds. His story
agrees with that of Whittaker.
"I was Just outside of Governor Taylor's
office," said Colonel Davis, "when I heard
the shots and heard Governor Taylor say,
'My God, what have they done?" Â¦He
called to me to at once go over to the
office of Adjutant General Collier, and
Whlttaker went along. I am positive that
he could not have done the shooting. We
were at the door of the building in too
short a time for that."
As soon as It waa known that the bullet
which struck down Goebel had come from
the building to the east a group of men
gathered in front of the door on the east
side. Others ran around to the door on
the west side to prevent the escape of
anybody from there. Several men at
tempted to enter the dix>rs from the out
side, but were prevented by groups of
mountaineers, who stood in the doorways.
Some of these men had Winchesters in
their hands and presented an aspect so
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 31.â Martial law will be declared in Frankfort at 6 o'clock this
morning and the. session of the Legislature at which the Democrats have determined to seat
Goebel will be stopped by the military. One of the highest officers with the troops said:
"The Legislature says it is going to meet at 10 o'clock. Maybe it will, but whatever it
does, it will not unseat Governor Taylor to-day."
Soldiers have been arriving at intervals all night. Three hundred men of the Louis
ville Legion arrived at 11 o'clock and the company from Covington came at 1:30 this morn
ing. Numerous other organizations are expected. About 600 men are here now.

7â >RANKFORT Ky., Jan. 80.â While
I i William Goebel lay at the point of
M death in his room as the result of
I an assassin's bullet,, the contesting
boards which for two weeks had
' been listening to the evidence in his
contest for the Governor's chair, declared
him entitled to the seat. The boards hav
ing in charge the contests between Goebel
and Taylor for Governor and Beckham
and Marshall for Lieutenant Governor
met at 7 o'clock to-night In the City Hall.
A few legal authorities were read to
them at the request of Senator Allen, who
wished light shed upon a few doubtful
points. The vote was then taken, and by
a 6trict party vote of 10 to 1 William Goe
bel was declared to have been legally
elected Governor of Kentucky. . . . . .
The Beckham-Marshall contest was
then voted upon, and a strict party vote
of 9 to 2 settled this matter. No announce
ment was made of the reasons leading up
to the report being made to-night, the
boards taking everything at one leap.
Each one of the members of both com
mittees announced that he had made up
his mind as to the merits of the case and
voted promptly as his name was called.
In the contest for Governor, Representa
tive Tarberry was the one vote in favor
of Taylor, and in* the Beckham-Marshall
contest Reid and Lilly were with Mar
shall.
An effort was made by a number of
Democrats to get together a quorum of
both houses, hold a night 1 session, hear
the reports of the two committees at once
and adopt, them, and declare Goebel the
Governor of Kentucky before morning.
They were anxious to giv;' him, the honor
befoi c he'Sted.' - So many "egifclatcrs hati
gone to Louisville and Lexington for the
night that it was found impossible to
carry out the programme. It Is a cer
tainty that Goebel will be made Governor
to-morrow If he is alive.
The attempted assasinatlon of Senator
Goebel had precluded the advisability of
a sitting of the contest boards this after
noon, but to-night the boards met in the
City Hall, being kept out of the Capitol
building by the militia. It was a solemn
assemblage of men who composed the
gathering. Mr. Edelen. one of Governor
Taylor"s counsel, said that it would be
idle to argue the case in view of the
state of mind, generally prevalent.
Mr. Edelen and Colonel W. C. P. Breck
inridge were the only attorneys of Gov
ernor Taylor present. Mr. Edelen, in ask
ing for a postponement, stated that he did
so on his own responsibility, not having
had time to confer with his colleagues.
Colonel Bennett H. Young, for the con
testants, followed Mr. Edelen, and said
the contestants waived the right of argu
ment, and would make none.
Colonel Brecklnrldge said he had ad
dressed a communication to the chairmen
of the two boards, setting forth reasons
why the argument should not proceed.
He said that the lives of the attorneys
for Governor Taylor had been threatened.
"I have no fear for my personal
safety," said Breckinrldge. "I have felt
that I should be here and no threats can
deter me from what I regard as my duty.
These threats, however, came from a
eource entitling them to serious consider
ation."
The rest of the counsel had agreed not
to appear at the meeting, as the dastardly
crime committed might be repeated un
der cover of darkness.
Edelen stated that he entertained no
fears for ' his personal safety.
Chairman Hlckman responded that he
thought the 1 attorneys were perfectly
safe.
Lilly, the Republican member of the
Lieutenant Governor contest board, ad
dressed the boards. He said:
"No heart is more pained than mine
over the occurrence of to-day. I want to
say that my mind is made up in this case
and ten years of argument could not
change it. Assassination is a crime of the
most, heinous character and I can under
no circumstances fail to express the utter
contempt for its perpetrators and insti
gators. The political debates arouse pas
sion. I feel it myself and so does each of
you. Nothing that could be said would
have a good influence."
The Republicans will, probably, as Boon
as the decision is rendered in favor of
Goebel, make application in the United
States Circuit Court at Cincinnati for an
injunction restraining Goebel and Beck
ham from taking their seats and the bat
tle will then be 'continued before Judge
Taf t of that court. â¢
The Republican attorneys and Governor
Taylor are confident that at least a tem
porary injunction will be granted and that
ultimate victory will be in their favor.
The grounds upon which the Injunction
will be asked are the prejudice of the
legislative body, the ' alleged unfltness of
several members of the contest boards to
sit in Judgment upon the case and several
other grounds which they declined to dis
cuss to-night.

opposition to D. M. Burns have fol

that makes noisy the headquarters of

the extra repsion was before the Mexican
in all its etriousiieai? and he was unpre
pared to me*?t H. His bluff and bluster
had counted for nothing. The phantom
Btreoxtb of which he has boasted was as
thin as the air he breathes. He was called
at hi? own game and for many hours to
day confusion and indecision reigned at
his headquarters. He was on the horns
if a dilemma and knew not which one
to accept. If he refused to permit his
chattels to po Into a caucus he stultified
himselfâ made himself ridiculous to those
who have accepted him as a political ora

into caucus, he went ' deliberately to
slaughterâ to an ignominous defeat. He
knew that the men opposed to him had
been emphatically against a caucus while
there was the slightest chance of his vic
tory. They refused to discuss the propo
sition in any form. When they discov
ered to-day, however, that they have
votes enough and to spare to defeat
Burns, they drafted and circulated the
call for a caucus. They were forcing
Burns with nothing In his hand to a

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMEXTO, Cat,
Jan. 30.â "I am not pledged to Burns; Ido not now
intend to vote for him. So far as that's concerned, I never
shall, no matter what the considerations. I have not signed
the anti-Burns pledge and will not, for sufficient reasons,
which I do not choose to make known. Neither will I sign
the caucus call, for the same reasons. But I will go into
caucus as soon as a caucus shall be called."
Assemblyman Milice of Riverside County was em
phatic or nothing when to-night he took occasion to deny
the claims made by the touts of Burns that they had him
on the shelf to be used when wanted. To a representative of
The Call he made the foregoing statement, and made it
without qualification. Taking advantage of the fact that
he had declined to sign the pledge of the opposition, the
Burns people have been proclaiming loudly these last few
days that Milice was theirs. They ignored the fact that
Milice's constituents are unanimous in their opposition to
the Mexican, and that Milice has made a reputation since
his arrival at the capital by faithfully acting as the repre
sentative of his home people. To-night, however, he tired
of their boastings and declared himself.

BURNS IN COMPACT
WITH MATT QUAY
Senator Clark Also in
the Combination.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WASHING
TON, Jan. 30.â The meeting of California*
Legislature in special session, as an
nounced in this morning's dispatches, is
the one topic of discussion In the CalU
fornla colony here. Strangely enough,
Quay's own future yet depends in a meas
ure upon this issue in California.
The Call' correspondent has frequently
wired intimations that there is an under
standing between the friends of Quay and
Burns. Those who understand thÂ© Situa
tion know that such a compact exists. To
those unfamiliar with the broad and lib
eral game of politics, of which Quay it* a
â¢past master, it may appear singular that
he should rely upon the far distant States
of California and Montana to aid his case.
Yet this is true and the explanation Is
easy. The John AVanamaker crowd has
for months been making a fight against
corrupt politics In Pennsylvania, and re
solved to move heaven and earth to defeat
Quay, the head and front of the Pennsyl
vania machine. Arthur McEwen's letters
to Wanamaker's paperâ the Philadelphia
North Americanâ have been devoted chief
ly to Quay's record, with frequent refer
ences to the character of the man who
would be appointed from California should
Quay be seated. This was having tre
mendous effect, especially when it was
known that Clark of Montana, the multi
millionaire, had been taken into the com
bination. Here was a powerful triumvi
rateâQuay, with millions of his own and
powerful industrial interests back of him;
Clark of Montana, the possessor of fabu
lous wealth, and, last but not least.
Colonel Burns, whose ill-gotten wealth
and powerful backing by the Southern Pa
cillc Railroad monopoly made him eligible
for membership In the combine. Tho tri
partite agreement was that they should
stand or fall together. It Is a notorious
fact that Quay's agents and Clark's attor
neys are working hand in glove. Now
for the part that Burns Is expected to
play. Quay, with his shrewdness, per
ceived that Burns' widely published record
was having an injurious effect on his own
prospects. He therefore caused the im
pression to reach certain manipulators of
California politics that he was in grave
danger of defeat by a few votes, but
might be saved if it could be made to ap
pear that Governor Gage had abandoned
his idea of appointing Burns and that the
Legislature would elect Mr. White's suc
cessor. Of course, the Californians real
ized that If Quay were rejected Burns
could not be admitted by the Governor'"
appointment. The California situation
was misrepresented to" Senator Hauna.
The latter was led to believe that the
Legislature certainly would not elect
Burns, and upon being convinced of this
as chairman of the National Republican
Committee agreed to advise the Califor
nia Republicans to elect a Senator. Not
only did the wily Quay succeed in rid
ding himself of the odium of the Burns
unsavory record, but it is well known hare
vision was inserted which will prohibit
the caucus from dropping the lowest man.
The amendment was inserted. at the sug
gestion of Senators Gillette, Stratton,
Smith and Flint, and is designed to guar
antee to members the privilege of voting
for candidates other than the two high
est. Under the operations of the amend
ment the caucus may come to a dead
lock. There is an impression in certain
quarters that Assemblyman Miller of San
Francisco is weakening in his attachment
to the cause of Burns* The anti-Burns
forces will make a mistake IE they attach
miich Importance to the talk that Miller
is not committed to the cause of the
Mexican. Yesterday a member from the
interior who has been reported as favor
able to Burns entered into conversation
with Miller, remarking, "The prospects
for the colonel do not seem very bright."
The remark was made in a whispered and
confidential tone. Miller was thrown off
his guard by the expression of waning
confidence, and at' once replied:
VNever mind my talk that Burns Is not
treating us right. I will be for the colonel
when the balloting begins. This outside
talk Is to create the impression that I
am getting weak and tired."
A Senator stepped down to the Gov
ernor's office this afternoon, and as the
door of the private room of his Excel
lency was open for an instant the Sena
torial vision was delighted at the sight
of Dan Burns, Guy Barham and Gage in
close communion. It is fancied that Gage
Is in favor of legislation which will en
able him to remove from office the Sena
tors and Assemblymen who refuse to vote
for Dan Burns. It is a fine thing to have
a freak Governor, with original Ideas on
the broad subject of executive authority,
to displace recalcitrant office-holders.

hopes that by: that time the "California

thus he will have one more vote in a close
contest where every one counts. Qtiay's
managers are now claiming he will be

opening of the civil war he was residing in
Fort Wayne. Ind., where, on April 16, IS6I,

dent Lincoln's call for three months' volun
teers, at the age of 18 years, he enlisted and
was muotered in as sergeant of Company E,
Xlnth Indiana Volunteers. While' in this ser
vice he participated In the engagements at
Phllippl. Laurel Hill, and Carrier's Ford, W.

of a pair of lusty lungs, punctuated with

en the Thomas. Among them were Mrs. .
Lawton and her four childrenâ Frances,
Katharine, Louise and Manly â who were
living at Manila when the brave general '
met his death. Mrs. K. C. Armstrong,
widow of Major Armstrong, also accom
panied her husband's remains to this |
country. i
The mission of the Thomas was pecu
liarly sad. In compliance with the orders
of General Otis, her only cargo consisted
of the four caskets and the numerous
tributes of "everlastings" that were sent
on board at Manila "by various munici
palities now under undisputed American
rule and by clubs and friends desirous of
showing their esteem and affection for
General Lawton. Manila deeply mourned
the fate of the brave officers, and the
transport brings word that the grief of
Mrs. Lawton and her family was shared
by ever}' element of the mixed population
of Luzon's capital. And when the trans
port left Manila Bay all flags were set at
half-mast and warships In the harbor sa
luted the dead with minute guns.
The central position of the main hold
was fitted up to carry the caskets, and
during the voyage a guard of honor
watched by the honored remains. Each
casket was covered with an American flag
and around the hallowed space was erect
ed a wail of white canvas. The many
tributes not perishable were placed within
the canvas sepulcher and will be con
veyed to Arlington Cemetery.
<3ne of the heavy silken black streamers
bears the inscription in Utters of gold:
"Paranaque Laspinas y Malabay Al Gen
eral Lawton;" another reads. "Manila
Club, with expressions of the deepest
sympathy and regret from the members
of Manila Clubâ Ermita Dec. 21st. 1899."
A large wreath of black everlastings was
lettered in gold. "Al General Lawton.
Junta Municipal de Bacoor." Another was
from "El Capitan Lara La Companl Mar
itlma." The Red Cross Auxiliary of New
York by Mrs. Henshall, sÂ«nt a wreath to
Manila, and others were From the towns
of Santa Ana, San Felipe and many other
municipalities and from prominent citl

After leaving Nagasaki the Thomas'
voyage across the Pacific was one of the
most cheerless on record. For twenty
days before sighting the Golden Gate, the
vessel met nothing but strong winds,
enow and mist. Not until inside the heads
were the passengers regaled with a single
hour of sunshine, and the golden rays
seemed almost an inspired welcome and
sympathy to the heartbroken family as
ridge and Lieutenant Conley. These and
Captain King saw the gallant general fall
at San Mateo, and they retell the story of
that dark day In the Philippines as it
has already been told in the dispatches.
"It was into my arms that General
Lawton fell when he was shot," said Cap
tain Sewell. "We had made a night
march, during a violent storm, intending
to finally crush Geronimo in Mariquina
Vailey. Before daybreak December 19
the command, led by. General Lawton,
had reached the head of the valley. The
attack on San Mateo begun at 8 o'clock
and lasted three hours. We had but few
casualties, although the enemy had sev
eral sharpshooters doing all the mischief
they could. The general always wore a
big white helmet and it seemed to us
that all the bullets were directed at him.
I told him of my suspicion, but he merely
laughed as the bullets whizzed by. He
was within 301 yards of a small sharp
shooters' trench. Suddenly he exclaimed,
â¢I am sfiot.' and while trying to stand
erect he fell into my arms, and a minute
later he was dead. He had been shot
through the lungs."
Captain King also warned the general
that the sharpshooters were clearly mak
ing him a target, aided by his white hel
met, but Lawton replied, "I guess It is
safe to see what they are doing on the
firing line." Ho had not gone fifty feet
when he fell, mortally wounded.
Lieutenant E. L. D. Brecklnridge owes
his life to the heroic thoughtfulnefis of
General Lawton, exere,ci6ed just before
his death. The last act of the brave
leader was to assist Brccklnridge to a
place of safety, after the young lieuten
ant had been shot, and it was while doing
this that Lawton was spied by the Fili
pinos, who at once marked him for death.
"I have that bullet in me yet," said Lieu
tenant Breckinridge. "and had it not been
for Lawton's bravery and unselfishness
we might now be occupying different
places. There was not a soldier in the
command that would not have given his
life to save Lawton."
In announcing the death of. General
Lawton. Inspector General J. C. Breckin
ridge, to which department of the army
the deceased belonged, said:
Amid circumstances calling for high skill
and courage as well a* great energy prompti
tude and endurance to insure the military suc
cess which had become famUtar to him he
wan struck in the heart by a bullet at' the
moment of victory and died almost Immediately.
As far as a soldier can. even to his last act
of devotion, he had in the Spanish war. as in
all ether warn since his childhood, served his
country well and an only a thorough soldier
could; and, p.e he fell, the country has taken
his name an<l fame tr> heart to cherish.

BRYAN WILL BE
THE NOMINEE OF
THE OUTLANDERS
Colonel Irish Talks on
Politics.
WHAT HE SAW IN THE EAST
MIDDLE-0 F-THE-BO AD ME2T WILL
BE EXCLUDED.
Colonel John P. Irish, naval officer at
this port, baa returned from a flying trip
to the East. He made excellent use of
the t'me at his disposal In studying the
trend of political opinion, a task rendered
all the more eas-T becsoze of his intimate
acquaintance with the leading puMlc mwi
of all parties. From what he saw and
heard, he is of the opinion that William
Jrr:r.lr.ps Bryan v.ill be the next nominee
of the "OutlandÂ«rs" for the Presidency
of the t'nited States, and that the silver
tongued orator n-ill be defeated worse
than he xvas in lSi*s.
Even the men who are to participate
in his nomination, says the colonel, ad
mit that it will be a perfunctory proceed
ing, because the nomination of the man
from Nebraska car.not be avoided, ar.d the
eampnlpn will be equally perfunctory and
FpintWs. This will come about because
the organization of the Democratic party
Is in Biyan'p ha:ids, and inert- is a feel
ing throughout the country that if any
State phouid evr.d up a delegation of pold
Democrats iwho naturally would !>e op
posed to Hryan) the National <"ommittee.
having charge of the preliminary organ
ization of the convention, will not admit
them, but will seat any delegates that
may be sent up for Bryan.
The programme Is for the Populists to
hold tn^ir national convention first and
nominate Bryan, and there seems to be a
very excellent political reason why this
should be done. The I'opuiists. four years
ago. took Mr. Bryan second hand from the
so-calk-d Democratic National Conven
tion, end the Populists say now that It
1* the turn of the IH-moorats to play
eecor.d fiddle to them and their pro
gramme as arranged. They have arrang
ed also to shut out all Populists opposed
to the programme. In the preliminary
meeting- at Lincoln. Nebr.. where Mr.
Bryan was present for consultation, a no
tice was sent out to the effect that none
of the middle-of-the-road Populists would
be admit t^d either to that conference or
to the national convention, so it has been
arranged in advance that there shall be
r.o toleration of any opposition at all.
When asked as to what was doing on
the Republican sldv. Colonr! Irish replied
that President McKlnley is the voluntary
choice of his party, and that Republicans
are confident of his election by a larger
majority than before. With Bryan as the
nominee of the other combination, both
Delaware ar.d Maryland will choose Mc-
Kfnley electors.
The question was then asked as to Â¦what
effect the proposed new Issue of expan
sion would have on the politics of the
country, and Colonel Irish replied that
the matter would be left In a tentative
condition, Fiibject to the future conclu
sion that will have to be readied in pub
lic opinion. The Republican party, hav
lr:p passed the pending measure to guar
antee the gold standard ar.d cut the end
less chain which was the means of the
d^pif'Tion of the gold reswrve in the treas
ury, Â¦will appeal stror.Rly to thÂ» support
of the country for Its fidelity to the sound
monry pledge made in ISSB.
Colonel Irish thinks that there is a pros
pect a'ro that the sound money men of
both p.irrlfs will very shortly participate
in further legislation TvhSch will induce
popular reforms' into the banking system.
.This system will treat ranchers, farmers,
fteckmen. miners and similar persons as
business men. f-ntltled to the same con
venience and economical use of their
crc-dlt in ln--sir!''FS as the merchant or
manufacturer The policy Is to discour
age congr-ption of spare capital In a few
cities of the country and distribute it
mon. equally. This will equalize the ad
vantages enjoyed by business men of all
<-!aFf-.es everywhere. When the sound
mor.ey men of all parlies s*-ek to secure
this legislation they are naturally willing
to use any party as the instrument of
their purpose.
"At present," added Colonel Irish, "the
Republican party enjoys the advantage
of being in power, and of having re.
deemed its pledge in relation to the gold
standard, and for sound-money men to
accomplish their beneficent purposes they
must use that party as their instrumen
tality. They are not blind to the political
Culy whlchsuch intended use involves la
thecampaign of this year."

MAHONY TELLS
THE MAYOR HE
WILL STEP OUT
Ready to Quit Public
Works Board.
DENIES PHELAN'S INFLUENCE
SAYS HB CAN2TOT SPABE THE
HEEDED TTJQL
Jeremiah Mahony, member of tha
Board of Public Works, has sent his res
ignation to Mayor Phelan. He will retira
from the board, and tho reason ho gives
is that the duties of the board would re
quire all his time, to the exclusion of h!a
private business. He denies emphatically
that he has any grievance against Mayor
Phelan.
"I went Into the board unpledged as to
appointments." he said at his home last
evening. "I know that much has been,
said in the papers lately about members
oi the city boards being pledged in ad
vance of their appointment. I was not
pledged. If I coulrt not have gone in with
free hands I would not have accepted tha
appointment. Ten days before I took my
seat I told Mayor Phelan that I would
not accept. I accepted only tho afternoon
of the day preceding the announcement
oZ the appointments. I hold that a man
should not be a member of the Board off
Public Works unless he can give all his
time to the duties of the position, for
there is enough to do to tan uj> all his
time if he pay attention to it. I can.
frankly say I cannot altord to give up all
my time, for my private business must be
attended to."
Mr. Mahony was asked If !t was not
true that 1 he had resigned. He denied this
to be true at first, but he would mt deny
that he had sent a letter to Mayor Phe
lan announcing that he would resign.
"That is a matter that It is not proper
for me to discuss at present," he said.
"But you have said that you would re
sign in saying that the duties require that
you should put in all your time as a mem
ber of the board, and that you could not
do this."
Mr. Mahony conceded that he baa
made this admission, but added that hÂ»
had not said he had already resigned. Ha
was careful not to deny he had written
to the Mayor, announcing his intention.
He was Informed that The Call had posi
tive information that he had written such,
a letter, and he would not deny that to
be true.
In addition to the statement that ha
would not continue in the board, Mr. Ma
hony made several statements of gen
eral interest. One was that he was con
vinced that thft charter provision con
cerning the making of a report of work
ing plans for the acquisition of publics
utilities could not be accomplished, in the
period of time allowed â one year. Thero.
would be rights of way to ascertain and
to consider; sources of water supply to bo
found; and cuts. gTades. fills and all tho
details of the preliminary work of the
making of water and light plants on a
3cale commensurate to the wants of the
city would have to be arranged.
"Has Mayor Phelan made any objec
tion to any of your appointments?" was
asked.
"No," was the answer; "he has not.
"Has any disagreement or any dissatis
faction with the Mayor anything to do
with your resignation?"
"No." said Mr. Mahony agaJn.

ENGLAND'S SEA FORCE
MAY BE MOBILIZED
LONDON, Jan. 31, 4 a. m.â lt is now
known that the Cabinet devoted much of
its discussion on Saturday to the mobili
zation of the fleet. Nothing was settled
except that until further security to the
home coasts has been obtained by naval
preparations the Eighth Division shall not
be sent to South Africa.
On Monday the Admiralty Issued orders
that the Channel squadron, instead of
leaving Portland this week for Gibraltar,
as previously directed, shall assemble on
February 5 off Eddystone and proceed to
Bantry *or a fortnight's exercises off the
Irish coast. thU3 keeping in home waters
for a time. This decision to delay the
Eighth Division at a time when reinforce
ments are so urgently required may mean
only that more troops are not yet avail
able and that the division will embark
when the shipping is ready.
The mobilization of reserve warships. If
such a course shall be determined upon,
would be- of the utmost influence. There
is nothing In the intelligence possessed by
the public to cause the. Cabinet's pro
longed discussion of this matter, and the
Inference is that the fleet may be. mob
ilized as a general warning to other coun
tries to keep their hands off the Trans
vaal situation, or that the Ministry may
have definite knowledge that the neutral
powers propose to take some advantages
elsewhere while England is bujÂ«y in South
Africa. . -Â¦-Â¦ . -
One thing is certainâ ten thousand men
all ready to go to South Africa are de
tained for reasons of which the public has
no knowledge. There Is talk of forty
seven military battalions being embodied.
These are all of the militia not previously
warned. A sharp look-out is being kept
on volunteers for the various South Afri
can regiments. . ?Â¦Â¦
The Daily Chronicle says: "Three sus
picious characters were rejected by head
quarters in one regiment on Monday. Two
were unmistakably of Boer origin. The
third, whose English was faulty, had been
a German officer."
Natives report that three Boer guns
have been removed from Spytfonteln to
Kimberley. The Boers are apparently
making a special effort to reduce the
place quickly. The Kimberley garrison
was safe last Sunday.
SPENCER WILKINSON
ON THE SITUATION
LONDON, Jan. 31.â Spencer Wilkinson,
reviewing the military situation. In the
Morning Post, says:
HÂ«re Is again a remarkable scarcity of In
formation about what is taking place In the
theater of war. There must be more than 100
war correspondents at Uie front, but they are
kept silent. The column under General Kelly-
Kenny has occupied Tliebus. about ninety miles
by railway from Colesberg, where General
FVench Is operating, and about forty-five miles
from Htormberg Junction, where the Bo^rs op
posed to General Gatacre are bolleved 'to be.
The strength of General Kelly-Kenny's column
is not told, but as that officer commands the
sixth division, the whole of which \um reached
Cape Town, and as there Is no word of any
part of it having gone to Natal, the probability
Is that the column is Identical with the di
vision. At any rate It Is hoped that this is the
case, and that the last has been heard of
breaking up divisions Into fragments.
The dispatch of this column. If, as must be"
presumed. It Is strong enough for Independent
operations, portends a great deal. In the first
place. It means that the campaign In Natal is
to be left to the care of Itself. For. If the
sixth division Is at Thebus. there la no other
force at Cape Town capable of turning the
balance In Natal. Ladysmith. then. Is not to
be relieved. .Its garrison must hold out as long
as rofslble or make a desperate attempt to
ficht It* way out, unless, indeed. Generai
Buller, with such forces as hÂ« has, tries a third
time to drive back the Boer army.
This does not Imply that the war will be
prolonged and that the Boers are to be given
time to push their advantage In Natal. They
wlll try to overcome Sir Georce White's force
and to take the .offensive against General
Buller. whose army they would. In that case.
perhaps, be able to hold by putting several
parts of their own more mobile force Into po
sitions In hjs front, flank and rear. General
Buller would keep them occupied as long as
his supplies and ammunition lasted.
During these operations the. British forces In
Cape Colony and the reinforcements on the way
would be collected Into an army to march
through the Free State. If that march could
be rapid enough to produce an effect on the
mind of the Boer commander-ln-chlef while
General Buller's force Is still occupying him.
the plan might lead to a decisive result, but
jhere can hardly be a. start fpr another month
and a march through the Free State must take
a month at least. It Is not eaay to-day to fore
see what can happen in Natal by the end of
March.
Meanwhile the mission of General Kelly-
Kenny does not altogether explain' Itself. It
seems a little strange that the new column
ehould not first have been aent to the assistance
of -General French, who has hemmed In a force
of Boers, but finds them reinforced from the
north. Anything like a division added to Gen-*
eral French's force oucht to enable him to
destroy the Boer forces with which he is dealing
by completing his circle around them and then
gradually closing It In upon them.
The formation of a fresh column while this
kind of concentration was possible looks like
a continuation of the old policy of dispersion
General Kelly-Kenny will have to mend the
railway bridge at Steynsburg as he moves east
ward, and as his advance continues he will
enter a hilly and perhaps, difficult country.

CAPE TOWN; Jan. 80.â General Buller
yesterday read the following message
from the Queen to General Warren's
force:
"I must express my admiration for the
troops' conduct during the past trying
week, especially those regiments that you
specify, and for the accomplishment of
your arduous march.", .."â¢ - -.*Â¦
General Buller said to the men that they

General Buller then called for cheers for
the Queen, which were heard for miles
around.
GERMANY REJOICING
OVER BRITAIN'S PLIGHT
BERLIN, Jan. 30.â According to private
reporte received hÂ«-e, the Cape Dutch are
still Joining the Boer forces. The German :
press expresses the belief, that Great
Britain has about reached the end of her
military resources, and would do well to
acknowledge defeat and conclude peace.-
The Kreuz Zeltung, which attributes her
reverses largely to the absence of com
pulsory military service, says: '
"Among the most interesting results of
the South African campaign is the.much
denied truth-that the worth of. nations is
weighed In war's balance, arid England, is
already in the midst of catastrophe." â¢
The Deutsches Tages Zeitung says: "It
is evident that not only General Warren,
but General-Buller's whole force has been
defeated on the TugeJa." This it calls
"the beginning of the end."
Boer Shell Factory Destroyed.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â A special dispatch
from Durban says a refugee who has ar
rived there from Johannesburg says the
destruction of the Boer shell factory at
that place was accomplished on January

LONDON, Jan. 30.â The seventh session
of the Fourtenth Parliament of Queen
Victoria opened at 2 p. m., after the cus
tomary formalities. -The Speaker, Wil
liam Court Gully, arrived at the House
of Commons at 1:53 p. m. There 'was a
large attendance of members.* The gen
tleman usher of the Black Rod, General
Sir M. S. Blddulph, summoned the Com
mons to the House of Lords at 2.05 p. m.,
where the Lord High Chancellor, Earl
Halsbury, read the Queen's speech, which
was as follows:
My Lords and Gentlemen: The peace which
had recently been .broken In South Africa when
last I addressed you has unhappily not been
restored, bui otherwise' my relations with other
States are friendly. In reslÃtlng thej Invasion
of my South African coloniea by the South
African Republic and Orange Free State, my
people have responded with devotion and en
thusiasm to the appeal which I have made
to them, and the heroism of my soldiers In the
field and my sailors and marines who were
landed to co-operate with them has not
fallen short of the noblest traditions of our
military history.
I am deeply grieved that co many valuable
lives should have fallen as a sacrifice, but I
have witnessed with pride and with heartiest
gratification the patriotic eagerness and spon
taneous loyalty with which my s.ubjects in all
partÃ of my dominions have come forward to
share In the common defense of their imperial
interests. 1 am confident I shall not look to
them In vain when I exhort them, to sustain
and renew ' their exertions until they have
brought this struggle for the maintenance of
the empire and assertion of Its supremacy in
South Africa to a victorious conclusion.
A treaty has been concluded with the Ger
man Etnperor for the adjustment of the rights
claimed by the two countries In Samoa, Tonga
and other islands in the Pacific. To a portion
of. these stipulations the Government of the
United States has aluo been a party.
A bill will be Introduced at an early date to
give effect to the scheme of federation which
has been adopted after most careful consider
ation by five of my Australian colonies.
I have watched with cordial satisfaction the
gradual development of my greater colonies* In
to eelf-governlng communities. I feel confident
that the establishment of the great federatto,,
of Australia will prove advantageous not only
to the colonies Immediately concerned, but also
to the emiilre at large.
The brilliant courage and soldler-Uke qual
ities of the colonial forces engaged In Snuth
Africa have already earned high admiration,
and patriotic offers of assistance which It was
not possible to accept have come from many
other colonies with populations of various
races. -
i I have received from the ruling chiefs of
the native States -of India numerous offers to
place their troops and the resources of their
States at my disposal for service In South
Africa. These proofs of their loyalty to my
self and their devotion to the cause of my
empire have afforded me much gratification.
I regret that, owing to Insufficient rainfall
In the autumn over a great part of Western
and Central India, the harvest and pasturage
have fallert to such an extent as to create a
famine. Timely measures have been taken
by my Government and by the rulers of the
native States affected to relieve the Buffering
and prevent starvation.
I regret to add that the epidemic of plague
continues and that, although Us severity has
not Increased since last year, there is at pres
ent no prospects of Its diminution.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons, the
estimates for the public service of the year
will be laid before you. The provision for mil
itary expenditure must b* largely Increased on
account of the charge for military operations
in South Africa. The experience of a great
war must necessarily afford lessons of â¢ the
greatest Importance to the military administra
tion of the country. You will not. I am con
vinced, shrink from any outlay that may be
required to place our defensive preparations
on a level with the responsibilities which, the
possession of so great an empire has laid upon
As. At a time when several nations are
perfecting their naval preparations at the cost
of Increasing efforts and sacrifices, the solici
tude with which you have provided for the
efficiency of our navy and our coast defenses
will assuredly not be relaxed. .
The rest of the speech recognizes that
the time is not propitious for domestic re
forms Involving large expeditures, rec
ommends amendments to the agricul
tural, educational, company, railway and
accident laws, and concludes:
It appears that service In South Africa may
have the effect of disfranchising those taking
part In It, and you will be asked to sanction a
measure by which this Injustice will be pre
vented.
I commend your deliberations at this anxious
time to the blessing and guidance of Almighty
God.
After the reading of the speech the
House adjourned until 4 p. m. and the
Commoners returned to their. House,
which also similarly suspended its sitting
until 4 o'clock. There was a conspicuous
absence of public excitement In connec
tion with the reassembling of Parliament.
A small knot of people witnessed the ar
rival and departure of the yeomanry of
the guard, the crowd around the entrance
to the palace yard at no time exceeding
800, and the few who were hoping for
some demonstration against the Ministry
were disappointed.
SALISBURY ATTACKED
IN HOUSE OF LORDS
Rosebery Demands Information as to
the Intentions of the Gov
ernment.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â 0n the resumption
of business in the House of Lords the gal
leries were thronged. There was an un
usually large attendance of peers. The
Duke of Somerset moved . the address In
reply to the Queen's speech, and the Earl
of Shaftsbury seconded the motion. The
Duke of Somerset, in moving the address,
said he looked forward confidently to a
successful termination of the war. He
urged the necessity for reform In the mil
itary administration, arid said that hith
erto the army seemed to have existed for
the benefit of the War. Office, and that in
future the War Office must exist for the
benefit of the army. The Duke of Somer
set eulogized the loyalty of the colonies,
especially Canada, and strongly deprecat
ed the adverse criticism of General Buller,
his remarka in this connection being
cheered. He said he had every confidence
in General Buller and Lord Roberts,
The Earl of Shaftsbury, Conservative,
emphasized the debt of gratitude which
Great Britain owed to her colonies, and
expressed satisfaction at the settlement
of the Samoan question.
The Liberal leader In the House of
Lords, the Earl of Kimberley, followed.
He said he was glad to learn that Great
Britain's relations with other States were
friendly. He added that he believed the
term could be Justly applied to the rela
tions with European governments and the
United States, and deprecated undue at
tention to the attacks of the foreign press.
His Lordship congratulated Lord Salis
bury on the conclusion of the agreement
with Germany, but strongly disapproved
of the tone of Mr. Chamberlain's speech.
In this connection, however, he paid a
warm tribute to the conduct of the sol
diers in the field and to the loyalty of the
British colonies. .
The Earl of Kimberley, continuing, said
that, although the moment was one of
the deepest gravity, he would entirely ab
stain from criticising the conduct of the
generals. It was the duty of the Govern
ment to select men to conduct those op
erations and it was their duty to support
the Government. It was, therefore, un
wise to criticise the generals In these op
erations. He did not mean to imply that
the generals were not doing their utmost
to fulfill their arduous duties, but the
Government would be wise if it made
every effort to prepare thoroughly for
what might occur In the future. Continu
ing, Lord Kimberley said:
We might make a period of disaster, and al
though our relations with the other power- are
friendly, it would be well to consider ti.e pos
sibilities of the future and It would be well if
the' Government prepared for all eventualities
and all dangers arid be ready with the means
to surmount them. The Government â¢ does not
Beem to have, been aware of the scale of prep
arations of the South African republics.-
Lord Salisbury, in reply to the Earl of
Kimberley, asserted that there was noth
ing in the stipulations of the conventions
to limit and hinder the importation of
arm? and ammunition Into the Transvaal
through Lourenzo Marquez. Continuing
the Premier said:
Why were we to knew about the Importation
of arms? I believe guns were Introduced Into
the Transvaal in bollprs and munitions of war
in piano cases. We had a small secret service
fund. If you want mug.h information you must
give more money. I consider the enormous
amounts spent by other Governments, especial
ly the Transvaal, which I have heard on high
diplomatic authority spent Â£800.000 In a single
yp.ir. and the small sums spent by England,
making It Impossible for us to have the omni
science attributed to us by Lord Kimberley.
I am glad lie has not pressed an Immediate in
quiry Into the action of the military authorities
at a time when our generals In the field ami
many of those who could give the moat val
uable Information are unable, to appear. We
should defer an inquiry to a more convenient
season.
Later the Premier admitted the deficien
cies of the existing system, remarking
that the treasury had acquired a power
which was not to the public benefit. He
had not thought of looking Into past his
tory or examining the amount of blame
to be attached to this or that Minister.
Said'he:
It Is not quite the right way of Wealing with
the present crisis. We must Join together and
exercise all our powers In extricating ourselves
from a situation full of humiliation and not
free from danger. I will not say that the dan
ger may not have easily been exaggerated.
Many a country has commenced a war with
difficulties of the kind we experience. We have
only to look at what the Northern States of
America went through at the beginning of the
Civil War to see how easy It would be to draw
a mistaken Inference from the reverses we
have met at the outset. We have every ground
to think that If we set ourselves heartily to
work and exert all the undoubted Instruments
of the power we possess we shall bring the
war to a satisfactory conclusion. We have work
which appeals to us as subjects of the Queen
and as Englishmen and It must throw In the
shade all thoughts of party expediency.
Lord Salisbury then said he regretted
that Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice, In the
House of Commons, was about to bring
this great issue into party controversy,
adding that the only place where his ac
tion would meet with sympathy was In
Pretoria. He continued:
Our effort must be to retrieve ourselves from
the present situation, which cannot be allowed
to lax. This empire Is a valuable and splendid,
but responsible, possession. We must concen
trate our efforts. If we do not tame all the
smaller passions Into one great duty we run the
danger of convulsions which will tarnish the
empire's luster and perhaps menace its integ
rity.
After Lord Salisbury had spoken, Lord
Rosebery made a fiery speech, demand-
Ing of the Government what it was going
to do, and adding that the country would
shrink from no sacrifice which the burn
ing emergency might demand. Lord Rose
bery spolte with great earnestness. He
asked why the Premier made it so diffi
cult for the man In the street to sup
port his policy. The past conduct of the
Government would come up for Investi
gation some day, he hoped, adding:
We have tho riÃht to know if, before the
crisis, the intelligence department supplied the
Government suÃlclent Information. If not dis
miss the department. If the Government pos
sessed the information their responsibility Is
heavy- I hope that when the time for the
Investigation arrives thoÂ»e who have served
the Queen will not be covered with such glory
that the eyes of the investigators will be
dazzled.
I was appalled at the nature and style of
Lord Salisbury's speech. We have now 120.000
men In South Africa, yet we are with difficulty
holding our own. The attitude of foreign na
tions is described as friendly: but that does
not strike me as being as amicable aa the
word would Imply. I deem It necessary to
know what the Government. Is going to do.
Lord Salisbury said the cause of our casual
ties was the smallness of the secret fund and
the British constitution. But what Is the Gov
ernment's duty? Some form of compulsory ser
vice must be Introduced to meet the grow
ing exigencies of the empire and I am sure
the nation will not shrink from either that
or any other sacrifice to preserve the empire's
predominance. That we should net shrink from
sending away vast masses of troops, situated
as we are In the center of a universe. by no
means friendly to us. without having- a hint
from the Oovrnment of the military measures
it proposes to take to face the disasters we
have met and the sacrifices we have made, Is
one of the most extraordinary features of the
British constitution. Â¦ I agree with Lord Salis
bury, that the country can carry this thing
through In spite of all the Impediments of men
and methods which have shackled It in the
past, but I venture to say It will have to be
Inspired by a loftier tone and truer patriotism
than that shown by the Premier.
Lord Kimberley urged that the Govern-
ment ought to have been aware of the Im
porting of arms into the Transvaal and
ought to have informed the Transvaal
that unless it desisted it must result in
Great Britain sending a large force to
South Africa, lie could not believe the
Government was so ignorant of the P re Pr
aratlons of the Transvaal, and it could
not divest Itself of the responsibility.
Baron Balfour of Burleigh said that the
Jameson raid had closed the mouth of the
Government and prevented it protesting
against the arming of the Transvaal.
But, he added, the Government must
have known , armaments were ac
cumulating to an extent unjustified by
fears of another raid, and it was the dnty
of the Government to communicate on the
subject with the Boer Government, but
as the first step It ought to have severely
punished the raiders. The country had
not reached a pass that If the Govern
ment appealed to It It would not have
supported the Government in any prep
arations it thought necessary.' Ho would
do nothing to prevent the Government
carrying on the war to a successful con
clusion. ' .
The Marquis of Lansdowne. Secretary
of State for War. followed. He said he
was prepared to make a statement at a
future date. The Government, he added,
was not prepared and had excellent rea
sons fox not pushing Its arrangements
further.
The address In reply to the speech from
the throne was then adopted.
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN
ASSAILS THE MINISTRY
Bitter Condemnation of Its Method
of Dealing With the South
African Problem.
LONDON, Jan. SO.â When the proceed
ings were recommenced In the House of
Commons, Balfour, First Lord of the
Treasury and Government leader, Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Liberal lead
er, and others were loudly cheered by
their respective followers. James Lowthor
made his annual motion relative to the
interference of persons at elections. It
was rejected by a vote of 337 to 101. The
Speaker read the Queen's speech at 4:43
p. m. Subsequently Captain Ernest G.
Prettyman, Conservative member for the
Woodbridge division of Suffolk, moved
the address tn reply to the speech.
The entry of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, waj
not cheered from any part of the House.
Captain Prettyman, in moving the ad
dress in reply to the speech from the
throne, expressed the deepest sympathy,
which, he said, was shared by both sides
of the House, with the sufferers from the
war and the sufferings in Natal. He fur
ther referred to the feeling of admiration
for the gallantry of the troops which was
felt by all parties, and remarked that ad
ditional common ground for pride was the
gallantry and national spirit shown by
Doth Great Britain and her colonies. He
expressed the hope that after the war all
race antagonism in South Africa would
be obliterated. Continuing, Captain Pretty
man, who is a retired captain of artillery.
Bald an inquiry was necessary as to how
the requirements of the war had been
so underestimated. The captain then ap
pealed fur the union of ail parties in sup
port of the Government in its efforts to
satisfactorily conclude a just war.
s Herbert P. Pike Pease, Liberal-Union
ist, member for Darlington, seconded the
address in reply to the speech from the
throne.
The Liberal leader in the House of Com
mons, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.
then arose to reply, amidst cheers from
the opposition benches. Sir Henry, com
menting on the Queen's speech, said he
had seldom known so little to be said in
such a large number of words. As, how
ever, the war advanced. It became more
difficult and more critical, and he was
not surprised that the Government had
riot proposed a formidable programme.
Affairs In South Africa, political and
military, would undoubtedly engage the
present Parliament to a great extent. The
war was uppermost in all minds when the
members separated in October, and it was
believed there were troops enough In
South Africa to rapidly clear the Queen's
domains. But their expectations had been
sobered. Week after week had seen
checks, disappointments and deplorable
loss of life. In every instance the ad
vance of tthe British troops had been
stayed by large bodies of the enemy. But
the country had again and again gone
through greater perils with courage and
composure, and would not now depart
from Its high traditions. The courage
and fortitude of British soldiers were
never more conspicuous, and they must
associate with this the sons of the colo
nies, who had shown extraordinary apti
tude in this kind of warfare. He appre
ciated the gallantry, the devotion which
led their countrymen to volunteer, but
he wished to know the reasons which
necessitated this unusual method of re
inforcing the army. He and his friends
had resolved to support a vigorous pros
ecution of the war. that the Integrity of
the Queen's domains be speedily vindi
cated, and he imagined there would be
no difficulty in obtaining the additional
supplies necessary.
"Here my agreement with the Govern
ment ceases," said the Liberal leader.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman then
proceeded with a bitter condemnation of
the administration and the temper in
which It had approached the whole South
African problem, saying that the narrow
ness of the Government's provision for
military requirements necessitated hostil
ities and asserting that its policy made
war probable. He believed this feeling
was largely shared by the House an 3
he was glad of the opportunity presented
to express his opinion. The speaker re
pudiated the Idea that they should await
the end of the war before discussing the
matter. This was the very time, he de
clared, for effective criticism, and those
wishing to disclaim responsibility should
do so now.
"The Ministers tell us. Sir Henry con
tinued, "that this war was undertaken to

Arthur J. Balfour. after a vain attempi
to draw Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
Into an admission that he did not advo

reproached him with waiting until the
country had become involved In military
difficulties to bring a vote of censure of
the Colonial Secretary-, which might have
been brought, Balfour declared, any tinu
sineÂ© 1595. In general defense of the
Colonial Secretary and the Government 3
policy Balfour said that one time thÂ»Â»
Government believed the war would be
avoided, but had subsequently becomo
convinced that the Boer Government from
the first never intended to give those
franchise concessions, the withholding of
which meant war. He denied that Gen
eral Buller had expressed the opinion that
the forces sent out were Inadequate. On
the contrary General Buller held the com
mon military opinion that the forces sent
were quite sufficient.
Replying to the direct question put by
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, "Did
General Buller go to Xatal purely In thÂ«
exercise of his military discretion?" Bal
four answered in the affirmative. He
then proceeded to rebuke tho opposition
for criticizing the War Office.
Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice then moved
this amendment to the address:
"And we humbly express our. regret at
the want of foresight and judgment dis
played by her Majesty's advisers, as
shown alike In their conduct of African
affairs since 1595 and In their preparations
for the war now proceeding."
Lord Fitzmaurice attacked Chamber
lain's policy, especially his failure to pun
ish the raiders and the retention of Cecil
Rhodes as a member of the Privy Coun
cil, together with "Irritating and reckless
methods that plunged the country lntu
the war before any adequate preparations
were possible."
The debate was then adjourned.

LONDOX. Jan. 31.â Perhaps the most
Important news of the war received
yestenday was that General Kelly-
Kenny With a column of the Sixth
division had, seized Thebus station,
which is to jthe west of Steynsburg
and oa'the railway running from that
pof&t cafft to KÂ«fff.ead Junction. No Indi
cation is plven of the route by whicn vhis
edvanoe was made, but It probably was
from MMdleburp to the east.
This movÂ«Â»mer.t serves to form another
lir.k in the rhain which is being put tr
pcther iplons; the line of the Orange Free
Ftate border. General Kelly-Kenny Is
now hoUVr.fr the halfway post between the
forces <if French and Gatacre. The coun
try- north of Thebus is very difficult, but
occupation of the village by the British
threatens the west flank of the Boers' pj
eition at i>tcrml>eng.
Apart from the appearance of Krlly-
Kenny at Thebus there are other Indica

The commanders of two transports with
ar!i!iery and cavalry, which had been sent
from Cnpe T<rwn to Durban, received or

at once.
A number of transports have arrived at
Cape Town recently, but nothing is
known as to the disposition of the troops
which they caxriod. Others are Just ar

has been able to send considerable rein

that Duller, in addressing hiÃ troops on

is to be a fresh advance upon I^adysmith
and a fresh crossing of the Tujjela, but
it is difficult to find any reasons for ex
acting success after the recent severe
repulse. Had large reinforcements reach

no Fuch reinforcements, so far as known,

One fact which seems to bear supposi

TRANSPORTS AND
MAIL STEAMERS
ARRIVE IN PORT
Kosmos Liner Volum
nia Discharging.
HONOLULU STEAMERS LATE
AUSTRALIA AND NIPPON MARU
HAVE BEEN DELAYED.
Volumnia Carried a Full Cargt) From
Central America, While the San
Bias Was Nearly Empty.
Water Front Notes.
Two Central American steamers and
two transports made port yesterday, while
the Australia .from Honolulu and the Nip
pon Maru from the Orient were expected
to make the lightship before dark, but
failed to put in an appearance. The Aus
tralia did not go alongside the wharf at
Honolulu, and in consequence all her car
go had to be lightered. The Nippon Maru
would stop at the islands on her way here,
and she also would have to lighter her
cargo and freight. This proceeding, ne
cessitated by the plague, has probably de
tained both vessels, and they will not
make port before to-day.
Should the Australia be put in Quaran
tine on her arrival here there will be no
delay in sending the malls away on sched
ule time. The transport Zealandla was re
turned to the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany some time ago, and she has been
overhauled and made ready to go to sea
at an hour's notice. Should the Austra
lia be held in quarantine then the Zsalun
dla will go out in her place.
The arrivals yesterday were the Pacific
Mall Company's steamer San Bias from
Panama and way ports, the Kosmos line
steamer "Volumnia from Antwerp, via
South and Central American ports, and
the transports City of Puebla and Thomas
from Manila. The difference between the
cargoes of the San Bias and Volumnia
from Central American ports was notico
able. The consignments sent from points
north of Panama on the San Bias com
prised about 554 sacks of coffee, 32S boxes
of limes and 115 sacks of ore, while the
Volumnia, from the same region, brought
up 1850 tons of coffee, sugar, silver ore,
concentrates, hides, mahogany and other
merchandise.
The Volumnia is almost a duplicate of
the Tanis, the first of the Kosmos fle-it
to come to this port, save that she Is a
little over 150 tons larger. She will take
away about 4500 tons of general mer
chandise from here for Central and South
American ports, and as nearly her entire
cargo is engaged she should get quick dis
patch. The Volumnia has first-class pas
senger accommodation and Is a good a\er
age thlrteen-knot boat. She made the run
from Antwerp, stopping at all the princi
pal South and CentraL American ports,
in 105 days, but when the line is In srood
working order that time will be cut down
by nearly a fortnight.
The transport Thomas carried the re
mains of General L#awton, Major Logan
and several other heroes, so as soon as
she was sighted all the flags on the ship
ping in port were placed at naif-mast. The
steamer remained at anchor off Black
Point during the day, and about 5 p. m.
docked at the Government wharf. The
City of Puebla was placed In quarantine,
but was released after sundown and came
to an anchor off Folsom street wharf.
M. Josephson, a commissariat clerk, and
F. Weifels, a quartermaster's clerk, v:ere
the only passengers who came ov^r on
hpr.
The transport Senator passed In through
the heads about 11 o'clock last evening
and anchored In the north bay. She is
twenty-seven days out from Manila, a
remarkably good trip over. She brings,
according to dispatches, thirty-four sick
and seventeen insane, the sick for the
general hospital at the Presidio, the in
sane for the Government hospital in
Washington.
A private letter from Oyster Bay re
ceived here yesterday states that the col
lier Miami is a total wreck and that Cap
tain ButUr. the pilot. Is in hiding. The
Miami, with 4000 tons of coal aboard, left
her wharf in Oyster Bay at 7 a. m. At
that time It was hardly daylight, but Pilot
Butler wanted tc get the steamer to soa,
so he carried her along at full speed.
Three-quarters of an hour later she was
hard and fast on the reef. The place
where the Miami struck is well known to
the pilots, and they generally get as near
to It as possible in order to make a Ehort
cut. About four feet more sea room and
the Miami would have gone clear. The
sea room was not there, however, and she
struck. At first it was thought the col
lision bulkheads would hold and that the
steamer would be saved, but this proved a
false hope. As soon as the strain caused
by the falling tide came, the bulkheads
burst and the ship opened up and went
down. The crew had no hopes for the
steamer and got their personal eiTectn
ashore early. The United States Consul
at Chemalnus, B. C. has taken charge of
the wreck for the underwriters, and will
see what can be done to save the machln
erv and running gear.
Four more vessels have been added to
the overdue fleet, making five on which
reinsurance Is being paid In this port. On
the Annie Thomas, from Cardiff for Aca
pulco. 12 per cent is being paid, while on
the May Flint, from Hongkong for Ta
coma: the Knglehorn. from Yokohama for
Tacoma; the Crompton, from San Fran
cisco for Antwerp, and the Silo, from
Hongkong for Vancouver. B. C, 8 per cent
is being paid The May Flint Is one of the
fleet of vessels recently purchased by the
California Shipping Company from Flint

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of tbt etomach has long be*n
considered the n<Â»xt thing to incurable
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
ing e^r.satlon after eating, accompanied
sometimes with sour or watery rising's, a
formation of gasf-s. raus'.r.g pressure on
th<> heart ar.d iur.jrs and diti'.eult breath-
ing, headaches, fickle appetite, nervous-
ress and a general played out. languid
feeling.
There ia often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tongue. s.nd If the interior of the
etom&rh could be wen it would show a
elimy. inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and obsti-
rate trouble !s found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before It has time to ferment and
Irritate the delicate mucous surfaces of
the Etomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy dljrestion is the one neceÂ«<;ary
thing to do and when normal digestion
'.f secured the catarrhal condition will
have disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson. the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase.
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux. Golden Seal
and fruit acids. These tablets can now
be found at all drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Dyypeps'.a Tablets

use<J with perfect safety and assurance
that healthy appetite and thorough di-
gestion will follow their regular use after
meals.

DECLARES BOTH TRIED
TO THROW THE FIGHT
Fitzsimmons' Sensational Announce
ment Concerning the Corbett-
Sharkey Event.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. SO.â ln announcing
that he had been drugged during his dis
astrous battle with James J. Jeffries, Rob
ert Fltzsimmons stirred up a greater sen
sation in the world of pugilism than It
has known before for many years. There
was an inclination to give Fitzslmmons
the benefit of the doubt and accept his
explanation of an unsatisfactory fight.
Another bombshell was exploded by the
former champion to-night when he made
the announcement that the alleged fight
between Corbett and Sharkey was pre
arranged, but that both of the fighters
were trying to throw the event, and that
Corbett succeeded in giving all concerned
what, among confidence men, is known
as the "double cross."
Fltzsimmons also cast defiance in the
faces of Jeffries and his manager, Billy

ONLY ONE WAY TO SAVE
CITY FROM BANKRUPTCY
ST. MARY'S PARK APPROPRIA
TION MUST BE DIVERTED.
Auditor Wells Offers a Solution of
the Tangle in the City's
Finances.
Considerable anxiety has been engen
dered as a result of the conference of city
officials held In the Mayor's office Mon
day last for the purpose of devising ways
and means to tide over the existing finan
cial difficulties of the city. Notwithstand
ing that the Mayor advised economy in
all departments, nearly all 'he officials
asked for Increased appropriations, claim-
Ing that the business of their offices could
not be carried on with the Inadequate
force allowed by the charter. In discuss
ing the subject yesterday. Auditor Wells
said:
"There Is only one way to save the city
from bankruptcy, and that is to use the
appropriation of $125,000 for the proposed
St. Mary's Park toward settling the de
ficit of $139,000 left over from the last six
months. We might then, by the strictest
economy on the part of the heads of de
partments and by postponing all the con
tracts they possibly can until the next
fiscal year, manage to struggle through
until July 1. The Supervisors could then
provide $50,000 In the next tax levy, $50,000
the year following and $25,000 thereafter
for tne acquisition of St. Mary's Park.
"The Board of Health Is showing a dis
position to spend a great deal of money.
Former Secretary Carroll has informeo
me that the old board expended $44,000
during the last six months, and now the
new board insists on an outlay of $6000
additional, or $50,000, for the next six
months. It appears to me that the board
should go easy In Its policy of creating
so many positions and should content it
self with from $35,000 to $40,000 for the next
half year.
"We will find out before very long that
the claim made during the campaign that
the city would be saved at least $1,000,000
under the new charter was false as well
as absurd. Indeed. I stated openly when
the charter was promulgated that the city
could not be managed under its provisions
as economically as under the Consolida
tion Act. I think that the revelations at
the conference in the iMayor's office fully
sustains me in that contention."

RAILROAD CONFERENCE.
Meeting to Arrange a New Time Card
Held Yesterda7.
A conference of prominent railroad men
was held in the Southern Pacific building
yesterday afternoon to arrange a new
time table to meet the changes on the
LÂ»enver and Rio Grande and the Rio
Grar.de Western roads, each of which is to
put on a third train between Ogdtn and
Ltenver on the 25th prox.
The new schedule, as far as it effects
this city, has changed the running time
end provided for the following addition*
to trains, all of which arrangements go
into effect on February Â£5:
The hmitf-d morning overland out of this
city will carry. in addition to the sleepers
that go to Chicago by the Northern Pa
cific and Northwestern lines, a. through
Chicsgo, Hock Island and Pacific sleeper
via Denver. The 6:30 p. m. out of here
will rarry a through Chicago, Burlington
and Quincy sleeper.
The limited train that arrives here at
5:15 p. m. will bring in a Rock Island car
and the running time of the train which
row arrives at s:5O p. m. will be cut down
over four hours, so that train will be due
at 5:15 in the afternoon. This big reduc
tion in time will prove very satisfactory
if the train that it affects can ever be got
in at the hour scheduled. If. however,
this new schedule works 89 have all the
others that have preceded it. it will only
serve as a new basis from which to start
EuesKiriC at the hour the engine will really
pull in at its terminal point.
CHAPLAIN DAVID H. SHIELDS
Chaplain David H. Shields, who has
been sentenced by court-martial to be dis
missed from the United States army on
February l. .because of his tendency to
overindulgence in strong liquor, lies on a
cot at the Receiving Hospital slowly re
covering from an attack of 'alcoholism.
The disgraced preacher was found In a
semi-conscious condition, stretched out at
full length on one of the stringers of the
pier near the chief wharfinger's office
shortly before noon yesterday. Just how
long he had been there Is not known, but
It is doubtful if he would be alive now
but for the practical sympathy of a ten
der-hearted and energetic woman.
Chaplain Shields has been a familiar
figure around the chief wharfinger's of
fice of late, dropping in frequently for a
few moments' conversation with Percy
Henderson or some of the latter's subor
dinates. His failing was known to them
all and they sympathized with the genial,
eloquent man of God. whose one fault was
his craving for whisky.
Mr. Henderson was standing In front of
his office yesterday conversing with Mrs.
Dr. d'Ancona, who had come down to the
front to welcome some friends arriving on
one of the incoming steamers, when his
eye fell upon the form of the chaplain.
"There are some things worse than
death." remarked the chief wharfinger,
nodding his head in the direction of the
unconscious preacher. He then proceeded
to Inform Mrs. d'Ancona of the identity
of the man and the story of his disgrace.
Mrs. d'Ancona's sympathy was arousecr
at once.
"Cannot we do something for him?"*
she asked. With that she started In the
direction of the chaplain. Mr. Henderson
accompanying her. It was not until they
attempted to arouse the unfortunate
drunkard that they had any Intimation
of his actual condition. Mrs. d'Ancona
at once telephoned to Dr. Bunnell, chief
emergency surgeon, and asked him to
have the man removed to the Receiving
Hospital for treatment. The request was
granted, but when the ambulance arrived
from the hospital with the chaplain Dr.
Bacigalupi found that the man was in a
very precarious condition. While alcohol
ism was the chief cause of his condition,
he was suffering from exposure and lack
of food. For a while It was feared he
would not revive, but last night he was
pronounced out of danger. Mrs. d'Ancona
will not stop In the good wcrk she has
taken upon herself until she has arranged
to send the chaplain back to his family
at Fort Wavne, Ind.
Chaplain Shields was . appointed to his
position in the army two years ago... He
was stationed at Alcatraz when charges
were filed against him of conduct preju
dicial to the good order and discipline of
the army. It was shown at the trial that
he had been intoxicated on several occa
sions in the presence of enlisted men and
civilians and he was found guilty. The
lindlngs of the court-martial were ap
proved by the Washington authorities
several days ago and the chaplain sen
tenced to be dismissed from the army on
February 1. His future is dark, with
scarcely a ray of hope to light his way
to a new career. Officially disgraced, re
pudiated by his fellow ministers and a
slave to the liquor habit, he is thrust out
upon the world In the evening of his life
to provide food and raiment for his wife
and children, without a dollar of capital
and barred from pursuing his profession.
Under these circumstances It is hardly to
be wondered at that he mould become
wholly discouraged and give way com
pletely to the weakness that proved his
undoing.

Judge Troutt says:
"A Question !s eerious!y urped as to
whether or not a certain bequf6t of $100.

of St, Ignatius College for the erection

or not this court having the power can
properly exercise It by appointing Arch
bishop Riordan trustee In place of the

whem have formally declined to accept
the bequest. It Is Quite clear that the
aforesaid bequest, if a valid trust, is a
trust for charitable uses and hence dues
not fall within the inhibition of the con
stitution or statutes against perpetuities.
In my opinion the trust is a valid one.
It is provided by the Civil Code of oui
State that the Superior Court may ap
point a trustee whenever there is a va
cancy and the declaration of trust does
not provide a practicable method of ap
pointment, and that when a trust exists
without any appointed trustee, or where
all of the trustees renounce, die or are
discharged, the court may appoint an
other trustee and direct the execution of
The trust. In the light of these statutory
provisions, I do not hesitate to declare
that this court, sitting in probate, not
only has the power but is required to
appoint a trustee to whom the money be
queathed as aforesaid should be distrib

ADVERTISEMENTS.
From the rate at which our exports of manufac
tures arc increasing it is believed the total at the end
cf the fiscal year will exceed an average of $1,000,000
â¢ day. That is what comes of protecting home indus
tries and giving American energy an opportunity to
develop itself. When our shipping industries have
enjoyed an equal protection for a few years we will
be able to carry the commerce of foreigners as well
as to manufacture the goods for them.
The British Vice Consul at New Orleans has fol
lowed the example of the late lamented Sackville
West by not only opening his mouth, but by putting
his foot in it. He forgot, when he attacked Senator
"Billy" Mason, that he was making an onslaught on
an American. Before the Senate gets through with
him he will appreciate the virtue of silence.
Some industrious student of the constitution and
datutes of the United States might be able to inform

SOUTH AFRICAN TACTICS
"T~'HAT England is having a hard time fighting
I men who wear clothes is sadly apparent even to
â¢ the politicians who hurried the country into
war. ' The saying that in vain the trap is set in sight
of the bird has not held true in British tactics so far.
Joubert has set and baited trap after trap and the
trained British commanders have walked into every
one in succession, from Elandslaagte to Spion Kop,
with the most disastrous results. After the succes
sive failures of White, Gatacre and Buller it is ex
tremely doubtful whether such naked men fighters
as Roberts and Kitchener will have any better suc
cess in going up against warriors who pray and wear
clothes. There is spreading abroad a suspicion that
a long succession of conquests of weak or semi
civilized people has not been a proper military train
ing to equip England to meet a nearly equal foe.
There is much reason in this. It seems to be the
philosophy of combat. If a pugilist in the heavy
weight class be continually matched against a feather
weight, he trains continually further away from his
own class and is sure of ; defeat if he meet an antag
onist who has kept his mettle hard by meeting his
eouals.
Whatever the cause, the British military establish
ment proves so defective at thiT first serious call upon
it since the Sepoy rebellion that its prestige is slip
ping away. It was the hope of British philosophers
that the empire so far acquired would be cemented by
justice and policy and not endangered by further ag
gressions.
It is significant that while Kipling's poetry of im
perialism is yet in the bugle notes that summon Brit
ish subjects to arms, his undertone is rising as the
motif of opposition to the whole costly programme
of bloodshed and conquest. "The price of admir
alty" and the fear "lest we forget," which have been
treated as the necessary antithesis to give a saber
flash to his lines, are being lifted from their subor
dinate place, and the price paid for gold and glory
and the penalty of forgetting are in serious British
thought. It is well that this is sol The habit of look
ing after leaping is a dangerous policy for nations.

It has become habitual in England through her prac
tice of taking up the white man's burden after, taking
the black man's life. From Plassy to Chitral it has
not been necessary to look ahead, beyond" tumbling
the dead blacks into a trench and proceeding to ad
minster upon their civil. estate.. But this habit has so
far proved England's undoing in South Africa. Every
leap has been taken in the dark, and the landing has
been upon something worse than the Scotch thistles
that drew blood and blasphemy from the barefooted
Danish invaders. Already $125,000,000 has been poured
into a campaign that has brought not one compen
sating victory.- Added to this is the awful sacrifice
of life, the greatest. that England has suffered since

ABOUT HONESTY.
THE revelation of the relations between the
Mayor and the Examiner has greatly illumin
ated the political situation in San Francisco.
There is no controversy as to the facts. It is now in
evidence, put there by the Mayor's friends, that he
secured the support' of the Examiner and its push by
farming out to it in advance the Police ' Department;
that he sought to gild the redemption of this promise
by selecting a Police Commission that could not be
reproached with any past, misconduct, public or. pri
vate; that he conditioned the appointment of those
Commissioners, directly in some cases and in others
by implication strong, upon their election of his can
didate as Chief of Police; that he then supported the
election of Esola, to redeem his promise to the Ex
aminer. So far there is no dispute of these facts.
The Police Commissioners, being gentlemen, under
stood their direct or implied pledge to bind them to
accept and elect a candidate whom they could sup
port without losing their standing, in the community
as gentlemen and honest men. ; They were undoubt
edly programmed, but they supposed that it was:"a
gentlemen's agreement." '. They did not understand
it to bind them to a programme which meant the
election of Esola and the degradation of the Police
Department at the beginning of their administration.
The}' were far from expecting that, conformity to the
condition of their appointment meant an act that
lifted them from the place o.f honor they had filled in
the community and seated : them in the midst of the
lew company that had abused authority and dis
graced the city in the worst days of its misgovern
ment. .â¢ ' â¢ â¢- 'Â¦ ' ; . â¢
That they flinched is to their credit. That the sac
rifice of their honor and character was finally pre
vented by Senator Biggy is something that gains for
that gentleman the grateful. acknowledgment of their
friends. . .
Senator Biggy refused to abide by the condi
tions of a programme which led to the sacrifice of
his good name. One man has rio right to exact a
promise which a gentleman can make and demand its
redemption by an act of which no gentleman can be
guilty. This was exactly the situation. The Ex
nminer influenced the government of this city in past
years cheek by jowl with. political blackguards who
profited by the exercise of public authority. Under
the new charter it prepared for the renewal of black
guard government, using the Mayor as its broker
in the honor of men. His duty was to pledge honor
able men of high standing to .a blind programme,
and when it was disclosed the renewal of the Ex
aminer's blackguard government was presented as
the sole means of redeeming the pledge.
Because he refused to sacrifice his good name and
become a hissing and a byword in the community,
Senator Biggy is now highly honored by the daily
abuse of the Examiner. Its feculent vocabulary is
lavished to exhaustion in an attempt to discredit him.
The Examiner desired to use his unimpeachable in
tegrity and honorable standing as a cover to its pur
pose of reblackguarding the government of this city.
He refused to stand as its whited sepulcher, and,
having proved himself an honest man, pays the pen
alty in that paper's yelp that he is dishonest.
The Examiner never rises out of its class. It
measures all others by itself: It conceives that all
men are subject to the same motives which influence
all that it does. It seeks in Senator Biggy's busi
ness relations, in his personal associations arid
among what it conceives to be his ambitions, for a
reason that has its sole existence in his sense of
honor, which the Examiner cannot appreciate any
more than a hog appreciates the nightingale's gift of
The Examiner in its debauchery thinks that every
thing is wallowing in the gutter where it adds filth
to filth. So the wanton thinks others no better than
they should be, and the thief believes that he differs
only in degree and not in kind from other men.
The Call and other papers in this city which have
recorded the reasons that compelled Senator Biggy's
stand for his honor and good name have recorded
them only; they were created by the Mayor and the
Examiner. Upon them is the sole responsibility for
demanding what no gentleman could give and hold
his place in the community. It was their repulsive
influence, and not any attractive influence from any
quarter, that compelled the honorable stand taken by
Senator Biggy.
The Examiner cannot harm him. He is above
harming himself by submission to its dictation, and
is on the safe and high ground occupied by all men
v.-ho count a good name better than wealth or power.

salaries of stenographers la the criminal

THE ASSASSINATION OF GOEBEL.
r\ MERICANS of all parties and classes will feel
/ \ something of more than ordinary indignation
at the crime of the man or men who shot
down Senator Goebel in front of the Capitol at
Frankfort. It appears to have been a deliberately
planned assassination, and is the first crime of that
kind ever perpetrated in the struggles of American
political parties for the possession of office.
Had there been an open affray in the streets of
I rankfort there would have been little or no surprise,
for, unfortunately, human life is not held sacred in
Kentucky, and fighting blood is made doubly hot
there by reason of a false standard ot personal honor;
but the Kcntuckians have not been assassins. They
tave fought their quarrels out face to face, and the
shooting of a man irom ambush such as has been
cone m this case is almost unknown among them
There is of course no possible palliation for such a
crime. Xo politician more unscrupulous than ,Goe
tci has ever attained to any high eminence in our
politics, but he was quite within his rights under the
w of Kentucky in seeking to obtain from the Legis
lature a reopening of the issues of the late election
fend procuring from it a decision that would transfer
the governorship from Taylor to himself. It was an
rnwise move on his part and on that of the Demo
cratic leaders who backed him in undertaking it, but
there was nothing in it which in any way justified a
resort to violence on the part ofÂ«his political oppo
nents. PP
As our political contests are not infrequently bit
ter, and are conducted with words calculated to ex
cite the worst passions of the partisans on either side,
there is always more or less danger of fights result
ing from them. It is to the credit of our people,
therefore, that, notwithstanding their promptness to
fiphx, there has been very little violence used in the
Â«ettlement op political controversies. Now and then
there occurs an affray over some municipal office,
but anything like assassination has been rare. It is
true that Garfield was shot by a man animated largely
by political motives, and politics also had much to
ido wiih prompting the assassination of Carter Harri
Â»fm, but in each of those cases the criminal was hardly
above the grade of a lunatic. Possibly the assassin"
cf Gocbcl may prove to be a creature of a similar
I . Even in that case, however, his punishment
should be swift and sure. Assassination as a political
weapon is one crime which under our system of gov
ernment cannot be palliated upon any ground what-

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
THE DEAD FROM MANILAâ O. S..
City. The reason The Call has not pub
lished a list of the soldier dead from Ma
nila that were brought here on the trans
port that recently arrived, is because no
list was prepared, and as the coflins are
being removed the history of each is dis
covered on the coffin lid. The military au
thorities can, when all the inscriptions
shall have been read, give information to
those interested.
BORN ON THE FIRSTâ A subscriber.
City. Your baby boy is not the only one
that was born on the first of January,
1900, in San Francisco. It is impossible,
at this time, to tell how many were born
on that day, as the register of births for
that day is not complete, but there are
several already reported as being born
on that day. Selecting a name for a baby
boy that was born on that day is a mat
ter of taste with the parents. If it is the
desire to give the little fellow an odd
name, by reason of being born on the
first day of the last year of the century,
why not call hlm.Prlmo del Omega, which
means the first of the last.
NOTICE TO QUITâ OId Subscriber,
City. A tenancy at will is one where
there is no lease, either written
or verbal, *no matter how created, and
it may be terminated by the landlord
giving notice in writing to the tenant to
remove from the premises within a peri
od of not less than one month, to be
specified in the notice. A three days' no
tice is an unreasonable one. If you find
that the premises occupied by you are
not in a sanitary condition the easiest
way out of the trouble is to secure other
quarters if the landlord will not make
the necessary repairs. The law will not
Justify you in withholding your obliga
tion to pay the rent on the ground that
the premises are not in a sanitary condi
tion, for no one is authorized to take the
law in his own hands. If it is a serious
inconvenience for you to move you can
resort to measures to compel the landlord
to put the premises in orderâ that is, lodge
a complaint with the Health Board.

THE GOVERNOR'S ADDRESS.
GOVERNOR GAGE presented his views to the
Legislature on Monday, not through the
American. method of a message, but through
the method of European loyalty, that of an address.
It is not supposed, however, that the Governor had
any conscious intention of imitating royalty, and
I such imitation as occurred was doubtless due to un
conscious cerebration. His object in calling both
houses together in joint session and delivering an
address to them was probably no more than that of
adding emphasis. to his sonorous sentences and giving
the glow of animation to pis caustic verbiage. If
that were his object he is quite justified in following
â¢it, for the thing he said needs all the graces of oratory
and the illustration of gesture to render it interest
ing even to those who would like to be interested
in it. .
We regret that having imitated the royal style of
delivering his views, the Governor put into the sub
stance of what he said an imitation of Mayor Phelan's
after-dinner denunciation of journalism. Perhaps that
also, was unconscious cerebration. Certainly the Gov
ernor himself has nothing to. complain of from the
press of California. .Every newspaper in the State
has shown him a great deal of consideration, and not
a single one of them has published his record. It was
therefore an injustice and an ingratitude as well as
bad taste on his part to introduce into his royal debut
a slur upon a profession which, whatever may be its
failings, has certainly been lenient to him.
The Governor announced in his address that he is
of the opinion that the election of another Senator
from California is necessary; first, to the preserva
tion of the Union; second, to the expansion of our
moral influence in the Philippines and in Guam, and,
finally, to the promotion of the commerce and the ma
terial prosperity of California. Those who expected
that in dealing with the Senatorial issue the Gov
ernor would give at least an indirect indorsement to
Burns were mistaken. The demiroyal orator flung
"caustic verbiage" directly in the face of Burns with
a slam by declaring it to be the duty of the Legisla
ture to elect to the United States Senate a man who
will be unquestionably worthy of the high honor â
one whose ability and integrity cannot be justly as
sailed." Just whom the Governor referred to in those
words is not clear, but there will be suspicions that
he thought he meant himself.
One of the interesting disclosures of the address
is the revelation that the Governor intended all along
to call the extra session and was never in any doubt
about it. In one of his impassioned flights he said:
"In taking my oath of office I solemnly pledged my
self to support the constitution of the United States,
and I earnestly believe I would be recreant to that
sacred oath did I fail now to convoke this Legisla
ture for the purpose of electing a United States Sen
ator." In another strenuous sentence the Governor
thundered into the ears of the legislators that failure
to elect a Senator "is treason to the United States."
Of course the Governor could not have intended at
any time to be recreant to his sacred oath, or to be
a party to treason to the Government, and- accord
ingly all his statements of the past denying that he
had made up his mind to call an extra session are to
be regarded as strictly unofficial, and his conferences
with Herrin and Wright of the Southern Pacific
Ra jlroad on the subject were purely perfunctory, de
signed on his part to amuse the railroad officials into
the belief that they are "running things."
In the aggregate the address amounts to about
7000 words, good enough words in their way,
but so huddled together as to be mainly meaningless.
There were times, however, when he became lucid.
â¢In one of those times he uttered a plea for enlarged
patronage, and argued that he should have the right
to remove appointees and fill the places with men of
his own selection. It appears his particular desire is
to obtain control of the patronage of the lunatic asy
lums, though of course he has no objection to patron
age elsewhere.
Since the Governor was so eager to deliver the ad
dress instead of sending in a message to be read by
the clerks of the two houses, it would be a lack of
courtesy, perhaps, not to notice the style in which
he delivered it. It appears that the proceeding was
generally regarded as an interesting novelty and
drew a full house. The effects differed with differ
ent individuals; some were bored, some were irri
tated, some were amused; some slept, some swore
and some laughed. As an imitation, through uncon
scious cerebration, of Kaiser Phelan and Mayor Wil
liam, it was a failure, and the performance is not
likely to be repeated.
CITY ATTORNEY'S OPINIONS.
He Advises Regarding Appraisers'
Fees and License Taxes.
The City Attorney yesterday sent the
following opinion to City Treasurer
Brooks:
Regarding the payment of feeÂ« of appraisers
appointed by the court for the determination
of amount* due for collateral Inheritance
taxes. I beg to say that you are warranted in
paying the fees of such appraisers upon the
certificate of the Superior Court in and for
the city and county at the rate of $5 per day
for every day actually and necessarily em
ployed In the appraisement, together with the
appraiser's actual and necessary traveling ex
penses. Such fees may be' paid out of any
funds you may have in your hands on account
of said Inheritance tax. (Act of March 23.
1593. section 1L)
The City Attorney also sent the follow
ing opinion to Tax Collector Scott:
In the matter of the collection of license
taxes all doubts shouM be resolved In favor
of the validity of the license and thus in favor
of the city. If there be doubt in your mind
at any time as to whether or not under a
particular state of facts a person 13 exempt
from the payment of a license you are war
ranted In proceeding upon the assumption that
such person Is not exempt, but Is liable. If
such person contends otherwise and rÂ»fu!"Â»s to
pay the license thÂ» courts must be railed upon
to decide the matter. In vo dividing: each casÂ»
will of course be treated separately and ac
cording 1 to Its own particular merits. No sren
eral rule can be laid down which would covr
all cases that may arise and to attempt to
decide each case in advance of the legal evi
dence which may be shown upon a trial would
be but an a'tempt to anticipate the derision
of the court before the facts are presented.
COLONIAL
ASSEMBLY
Ladies of the California
Club Turn Back One
Hundred Years.
In powder and patches and dresses that
were the height of fashion more than 100
years ago, the ladles of the California
Club received their guests In their club
rooms in the Y. M. C. A. building last
evening and bade them join In such fes
tivities as were popular in old Colonial
days. . Â¦ ."
A Colonial assembly, was an inspiration
of Mrs. J. H. Jewett. Alone she under
took to see the entertainment through,
and the success of the affair is due to
her excellent taste, sure tact and splen
did executive ability.
Although the edict went forth that la
dies and gentlemen alike were to weai
the dress of the Colonial period, the ladles
alone saw fit to follow the letter of the
law. A few gentlemen braver than the
rest appeared in powdered wigs and satin
breeches, but they were the very few ex
ceptions to a general rule. Prominent
among the men in "costume" was "Un
cle" George Bromley. Magnificent in wig
and black satin, he led the grand march
and was the center of an admiring host
of ladle?.
The costumes of the ladles were for the
most part elaborate and elegant, although
.a few elected to appear in gray home
spun and snowy 'kerchief. The spirit of
the Colonial days hovered over the entire
entertainment. ... >Â¦
The musical programme, which opened
the entertainment, was made up of the
melodies that pleased In the days of our
Puritan fathers and "Washington. The
dances were the dances of olden times and
even the refreshments served were simi
lar to the plain dainties the belles and
beaux were wont to nibble at many, many
years ago. . 'Â¦
More than 200 invited guests enjoyed the
hospitality of the ladies of the club.

Senator Bacon's Plea
for Justice.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 30.â For more than
three hours to-day Bacon (D.) of Georgia
occupied the attention of the Senate with
a discussion of the Philippine question.
His argument, which had for its basis his
own resolutions declaratory of the Ciov
ernmenfs policy toward the Philippines,
was listened to carefully by his fellow-
Senators and by a large gallery audience.
Bacon maintained that the United State*
owed as much to the Filipinos as it did
to the Cubans, to whom, by resolution of
Congress, self-government had bf !f n
promised, and he strongly urged that hi.^
resolutions declaring it to be the inten
tion of this Government to confer tn-*
right of government upon the Filipinos be
adopted as a means not only of terminat
ing the war but of extending to a strug
gling people justice and freedom.

RUSSIA'S FINANCIAL
CONTROL OF PERSIA
"Widespread Importance of the Czar's
Move in Making the Recent
Loan.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â There is a wide
spread idea here that the Persian loan
has finally accomplished Russia's long
laid plans to obtain complete political and
financial control of Persia, with the
double object of ousting the British and
assuring Russia an outlet on the Persian
BERLIN, Jan. 30.â The news of the
Russian â¢ loan to Persia is inter
preted in Germany to , mean that Per
ela has virtually become Russian. The
press takes that view, which the latest
diplomatic reports from Teheran con
firm. In Berlin financial circles it is said
that the loan will not come to the Ger
man market.
The National Zeitung, referring to the
Russian loan, says: "There is no doubt
that Persia will hereafter be absoluteJy
dependent upon Russfa. The latter may
have made a doubtful financial bargain,
but, politically considered, the transac
tion is unquestionably of the highest im
portance."

A married woman could give a power of
attorney, a written authority to another
to do something relating to her separate
real estate, whenever she was permitted
to hold it. but she could not give one for
any other purpose. Yet It haa been ques
tioned whether she could sell, through
another, her separate real estate; In other
words, whether she could authorize an
agent to sign a deed for her. It Is said
that in those cases in which at the tlma
of signing a deed she must be exam
ined apart from her husband, for tha
purpose of finding out whether the sal*
is voluntary on her part and free from
all influence by him, she cannot sell
through another, because if this were
done she would avoid tho needful ex
amination. In other cases, where such
an examination Is not required, she can
appoint an agent or attorney to act for
her and sign the deed. When this '.3
done her husband must sign the poTver
of attorney. Just as ho would the deed
itself. In other words, the paper or In
strument she signs he must sign. too.
By the modern law a married woman
Is liable for all the wrongs, or torts, a3
they are called, which she commits. Sha
Is liable for slander, for fraud, for burn-
Ing property, poisoning jreese, etc. She
may bÂ« liable even for the wrongs of an
agent appointed by her, though at com
mon law she could not be>. because she
could not contract, and therefor* could
not appoint an agent. For wrongs of any
kird. except those against the man she
marries, done before marriage, she is lia
ble afterward, the Fame as though she
were unmarried, and generally her hus
band Is liable also. She also continues lia
ble for crime committed before marriage
and may be prosecuted for any crimes aha
commits afterward, with a few excep
tions in which her husband Is also an
active participant, and bcingr bo. 1Â»
deemed the sole offender.
An interesting rule of law In Its appli
cation to women is the statute of limita
tions. If A owes B a note drawn in the
usual way, which is not paid at the end
of six years, tha law presumes neverthe
less that it was paid, and B cannot aue
A for the money. The statute cuts off his
right to sue. B cannot get anything from
A unless he is willing to pay. or makes a
new promise that he will pay It. This
statute does r.ot apply to married women.
Thus If A should owe C (a married
woman) a note that became due whilÂ»
Bhe was married, and he did not pay it
within six years, her right to sue him
Is not cut off. The reason given for this
rule is that a married woman cannot sue
alone, and therefore her right to col
lect the note Is not perfect as lone as
she Is a married woman. Of course, she
would be obliged to sue within six years
after the end of her marriage relation, or
lose her right to recover at all. It is con
tended In some of the States where her
; right to sue on contracts is as perfect as
though she were unmarried that this rule
r.o longer prevails, and that there Is no
exception In the statute of limitations in
her favor.
The wide departure in the law with
respect to the lesral rights and liabilities
of a married woman may be lllustrat#d
by a recent case in Kentucky. A mar
ried woman diod and her husband de
clined to pay the b;i!s of the physician
and undertaker. Naturally enough the
law has gone so far in permitting a mar
ried woman to keep her property and
make contracts that the sorrowing hus
band may have thought that his wife
had made a contract with both the doc
tor and the undertaker, and If she had.
respect for her memory Bhould keep him
from interfering. The court, however, de
cided that a husband ought to pay such
bills, but if he failed to do so her estate
could be held for them. A similar de
cision was rendered r.ot long ago in Penn
sylvania. In like manner If a dyinjc
woman should make a contract for her
gravestone her estate clearly could bÂ«
held for the amount.

ATTEMPTED TO
BUNKO A PRIEST
Plan of Four Rogues Is
Foiled.
Ppedal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN EERNABDINO, Jan. SO.â A bold
attempt was made to-day to bunko Father
Cabellaria of the Catholic church. As a
result three men are in jail awaiting In
vestigation. Their names are Joseph
Drarado, Barlto Perdinando and Dominlck
Picar. It Is thoug-nt there was a fourth,
but he has not been taken. The three
called upon Father Cabellaria and told
him they had just returned from Mexico
with considerable wealth which they
wished to leave with a Catholic father
for saKe-keeping while they returned to
Mexico for more and would eventually
settle in San Bernardino and donate a
large sum to the church here. The priest
agreed to accept the charge, but they de
manded that he place In the box with
their valuables $300 as a token of good
faith and he could keep the box while
they retained tha key. He made another
appointment with them and went to tho
bank to draw the $300. Fortunately he
told Cashier S. F. Zombro what he in
tended to do with the money and was ad
vised to have officers concealed to watch
the men as undoubtedly It was a bunko
game. Accordingly City Marshal Hender
son and Policemen Ketrlng and Worden
were concealed in an adjoining room
when the men returned to complete the
deal. They took the money from the
father and with preat ostentation placed
it In the box with the other valuables,
locked and handed the box to Father
Cabellaria. The officers stepped out and
covering the men with revolvers took
them in charge. On examination the box
contained an envelop* with several hun
dred dollars In Confederate bills and sev
eral expired lottery tickets and also a
black bag containing: a bag ln?ide that
only went half-way down. In the bot
tom portion was several pounds of Iron
washers, the top portion being to place
a few eolnÃ as a blind, but these had been
taken out. The money deposited by
Father Cabellaria was tied up securely In
a white handkerchief, wrapped In paper
and was supposed to be a piece of brick.
There was also in this box a bag of iron
bolt heads securely tied to a cheap watch
and chain and a few valueless trinkets.
The bunko men had a room at the Brad
ford lodging-house.

DESK STUDIES FOR GIRLS: THE LAW.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
VII. THE LAW RELATING TO
MARRIED WOMEN.
By the common law marriage had a cu
rious effect en a woman. She almost
ceased legally to be. She could make no
contracts and her husband kindly relieved
her of pretty nearly everything she had
In the way of property. He was the
owner even of her clothes, her railroad
ticket or any other thing which he
thought worth having. On the other
hand, he was bound to support her. and
even the little bills she might have con
tracted before marriage for millinery,
dressmaking, soda water, rouge and the
like, he was legally bound to- pay. So.
too, In the eye of the law and in his pres
ence she could do no wrong, and this was
very delightful. She might be a real vi
rago and thrash a man before her hus-
band's eyes, yet in law (what a curious
thing the law is!) she had done no wrong;
her husband was the alnner and had to
suffer for It. If she could sue no one for
any wrong done to her, on the other hand
no one could sue her alone; her husband
must be made a party In all cases.
This legal relation was based on the
idea that by marriage the two persons
were blended into oneâ a kind of Siamese
twin affairâ and that public policy re
quired they should be kept as closely to
gether, during all weathers and on all oc
casions, as possible. Consequently she
could make no contracts, for if this were
I permitted she could forthwith assert some
Independence, on which the' law coldly
frowned. She could not even make a will
and give away her property, still less
make a gift during her lifetime. In short,
from one point of view she was the near
est to zero of any living thing.
Then equity, not law, began to have
pity on her and come to her relief. It de
clared that, if she had any real estate
before marriage or that if any good uncle
should remember her afterward and give
her a corner city lot or a farm, she might
still hold it as her own. Her husband
might be perfectly willing to take it. but
she could keep it if she wished, and make
a contract with reference thereto that
would be binding. Such a contract equity
upheld as a charge on or against the real
estate. In other words, the other con
tracting party might lend her money on
the security of her real estate, and in
the end take it If the debt was not paid.
Her personal property, however, her
stocks, bonds and the like, all went by
the common law to him, and thus she
was relieved of all thought of taking care
of them. Possibly the learned Judges
may have thought that by giving her such
a unique position among the daughters of
women they were favoring marriage,
which the courts, whatever others may
think, have always regarded as desirable
for the well being of society.
As the trembling steps of equity In favor
of married women did not result in the
overthrow of the happiness of the family,
but rather tended to strengthen it. the
Legislatures gradually began to set ande
the common law and permit married
women to keep their property and to make
contracts in relation thereto. Before giv
ing the more Important of these changes
It may be noted that by common law
when a wife's husband left the country
: or permanently abandoned her she had al
most the same rights as an unmarried
woman. Again. If he were civilly dead,
for example, if he were banished, out
lawed or imprisoned for life (which many
doubtless regard as an uncivil death), his
wife could sue and be sued and make con
tracts Just as she could before this
strangely civil thing had happened to him.
But the insanity of a husband has never
endowed her with similar freedom.
It may also be Etated that, while the
happy effect of marriage often is, and
rightly, too, to add somewhat to the dig
nity and importance of the parties in so
ciety, it has not the magical effect of re
moving their minority if they happen to
be under age at the tlma of marrying.
Marriage may have the effect of taking
a good deal out of them in the way of
money, temper and the like, but they are
infants still. An infant husband may feel
very proud over his feat of marriage, but
in law he cannot make a contract for a
single more goose egrs than he could be
fore. And if both are Infants, as they
sometimes are In more senses than the
strictly legal one, they are under the same
disabilities to make contracts for any
other purposes than necessaries until tney
attaln their majority as are other in-
By statute law a married woman can in
every State probably make a will and dis
pose of her property as freely as an un
married one. except so far as the husband
may have some rights in her property, as
she has in" his. Thus in nearly every State,
if not all. a married woman is entitled to
the use or income of a part (usually one
third) of her husband's real estate after
his death, and he cannot by his will * t
her off from this right. This Is ca>Jk-J
her dower. If he should give her other
property, stocks, bonds, etc., thinking she
would prefer them, she could reject these
and stick to her rights In his real estate.
Sometimes she does so. When she th!nkÂ»
she can get more from this than the pt-r
eonal estate given to her. unless her love
for him gets the better of her love for
the larger possible Income, she declines
to receive that given to her by will and
elects to take his real estate under the
law Usually when he has tried to cut
her" off with an inadequate or improper
sum her affection for him has not been
so far raised by the act as to blind her
eyes to the larger possibilities.
In this same connection something may
be said concerning deeds of real estate
given by married persons. As a married
woman has a right of dower In her hus
band's real estate, in many States he can
not give a valid deed to such property
unless she signs it with him. This is not
the law in all of them, especially the old
er States. On the other hand, he must
Join with her In a deed for the sale of her
real estate. At common law, before
equity regarded her. he had an actual es
tate to sell and convey; but evtn now,
though her real estate is actually l:eld as
her own. he most In most cases sijrr the
deed with her to make the sale and trans
ier vaUo. ,
Turning from real estate, to personal,
very generally a married woman can
keep her personal estate and the Income
therefrom quite as effectively as she
could if unmarried. This applies to the
personal property she may have at the
time of her marriage or that is gained
afterward, either by gift, purchase or labor.
In other words, she can hold and manage
it quite as freely as she could if there
were no husband around. Nor has any
serious harm resulted from this change
in the law. It Is true that the husband
is less of a family king than he was be
fore, is more docile if she carries the bag
and does not lose It. but the great fear
of the Judges of the olden time that such
a change In the marital relation would
lead to marital war has proved to be with
out a real basis.
Another change In the law affects the
married woman 8 right to engage in busi
ness. So long as she could make no con
tracts of course she could not be the ac
tive party In any business. The only way
she could then act was through her hus
band. If a woman wished to conduct a
millinery store her husband, however
worthless he might be. was the only
agency through whom rhe could act. In
many cases she went Into business be
cause of his inability or unwillingness to
support her. or perhaps "support himself.
And yet she was obliged to act through
him. Pennsylvania was one of the first
States to start the new movement by en
acting that a married woman could tn
gage In business and make binding con
tracts while her husband was at sea.
From this mustard seed has grown up
the law around this subject. To-day, al
most everywhere, she can engage in busi
ness and make contracts with as much
freedom as an unmarried woman. One
limitation on her power relates to the in
dorsing or guaranteeing of notes. She
cannot indorse or guarantee the debt of
another. But she can indorse a note of
her own. Thus, if A made his note pay
able to B, who wished additional security,
its indorsement by a married woman for
A's accommodation would not be valid
and she could escape payment If Bhe
pleased. But if she took a note in her
business for goods that she had sold, pay
able to her order, and she wished to raise
money on It by having It discounted, she
could Indorse it. and if it were net paid
by the maker she would be held as in
dorser if the proper steps were taken to
fasten her liability. The difference be
tween the two cases we think Is plain.
Though the form of indorsement liv- each
case may be the same, in the on* ;ase
CLARK INQUIRY
NEARING AN END
Interesting- Testimony of
Witness Geiger.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 80.--When the
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions to-day adjourned its hearing of thÂ«
charges made against Senator Clark of
Montana, in connection with his election
to the United States Senate, It was under
stood that the defense would be prepared
to proceed with Its witnesses not later
than Monday next. Campbell said he
would have only one or two more wit
nesses, and, without stating how many
men he would call, Faulkner said his wit
nesses would follow each other In rapid
succession and there would be no delays.
There .was but one witness on the stand
to-dayâ J. H. Geiger, who on a contest
was given the seat of State Senator In
the Montana Legislature from Flathead
County, at first occupied by Whiteside.
who is one of the principal movers in the
fight against Clark. Geiger voted for
Clark, but he insisted that he did so only
because the Republican caucus had de
clared for him. He confessed to having
taken $3600 in money home after the ad
journment of the Legislature. Of this
sum he claimed to have won $1600 to $1800
playing faro, and to have found $1100 of
it in $100 bills in his room. This latter
amount he thought had been left for him
to influence him to vote against bills 132
and 134, relating to corporations, but he
did not know who had left it there. Gei
ger said he had received no money to
vote for Clark, and while he admitted
having been approached with the view of
bribing him on other propositions, he re
fused to give the names of persons who
had talked with him, saying that to do
so would Incriminate himself.

Howard, the fruit broker, who is accused
of wrecking the Union Savings Bank.
The suit is to secure an accounting of
2.555.550 pounds of prunes. The fruit in
question Is some that Howard consigned
to the firm of Turle & Skidmore of
New York. The senior member of the
firm died a few months ago and the busi
ness is now conducted by Sylvester G.
Whitton, executor of the estate, and it
is this person who has been ordered to
give an accounting. Howard claims that
Turle & Skidmore are indebted to him
in the sum of $25,000. but the firm declares
it only owes him $7000. Trustee Bills
recently returned from New York where
he examined into the matter. Some time
ago the New York firm presented a state
ment to Referee Coulter in which they
stated they held 2,558.000 pounds of dried
fruit that was shipped by Howard and
that had not yet been sold. In New York
Trustee Bills learned that the fruit in
question had been sold for about $100,000.
The firm also claimed that Howard owed
them about $95,000 for money advanced.
Referee Coulter holds that the sale of
fruit was illegal without an order from
court, as by filing the claim and state
ment Turle & Skidmore had virtually put
the property in the custody of the court
and under its control and direction. If
this fruit is recovered it means many
thousands of dollars to be divided among
the creditors to whom Howard owed
nearly half a million dollars.

DISSENSIONS CEASE
IN THE IRISH RANKS
LONDON, Jan. 20.â A1l sections of the
Irish Nationalists were absent from the
opening session of Parliament, owing to
their attendance at a meeting In commit
tee room 16. Timothy Harrington, mem
ber for the Harbour division of Dublin,
presided. Those in attendance Included
Dillon, Healy. John Redmond and many
of their followers.
Harrington and Redmond urged that
the time had come to restore unity in the
ranks of the Parliamentary representa
tives of Irish Nationalistic Redmond de
scribed the prestige of Great Britain as
practically shattered and said there
seemed to be no better time for promoting
union upon a sound and enduring basis,
coupled with a policy of unity in com
bat and entire independence of all the
English political parties. He then moved
a resolution declaring at an end the di
vision of the Irish Nationalist represen
tatives and t*:\t henceforth they should
act together as one united party.
The resolution was carried unanimously.
By Mr. Healy's motion three whips were
elected for the reunited party.
John Redmond made the following
statement to a representative of the As
sociated Press:
The crisis In Imperial affairs, the conse
quences of which no man can foresee, has
caused a reunion In the Irish ranks. My reso
lution was accepted unanimously, chiefly be
cause of the desire to enable Ireland to make
herself felt at this Juncture In pushing Irish
reforms and In assisting the gallant South
African republics to maintain their independ
ence. The first act of the reunited Irish will
be to move an amendment to the address in
favor of the Boers. This duty has been con
fided to me. I regard the reunion on Parnell's
principles cf Independence as genuine. One
question, that of the chairmanship, will not be
settled for some days. Hut I think a unani
mous selection will be made.

BRYAN CORDIALLY
GREETED AT BOSTON
Informs Republicans That the Party's
Principles Have Changed Since
the Days of Lincoln.
BOSTON, Jan. 30.â Hon. William J.
Bryan was the central figure of an un
usual demonstration in this city to-night.
After participating in several events of
lesser importance during the day Mr.
Bryan addressed an Immense mass meet
ing in Mechanics' Hall, a building con
taining'a seating capacity greater than
any other In Boston. It Is estimated that
there were over 15,000 persons in the hall,
hundreds of whom remained standing
throughout the evening. The speakers
included Mr. Bryan, ex-Governor Altgeld.
Congressman Lentz of Ohio and George
Fred Williams of Dedham.
The first speaker, Hon. George Fred
Williams, was received with three cheers
and a tiger. During his address he ex
pressed sympathy with the Boers, a senti
ment that was vociferously applauded.
The next speaker, ex-Governor Alt
geld, was accorded a hearty reception by
the great audience. He declared that the
United States purchased the Philippines
from Spain and entered upon the task of
subjugating the rightful owners of the
islands because England desired it.
Speaking of the South African war the
speaker said It was the first time the Gov
ernment of the United States had failed
to extend sympathy for a people flghtin?
for its liberties.
The third speaker, Congressman Lenta
of Ohio, was warmly received. He said
that Abraham Lincoln was not quoted by
the Republican party to-day, and that the
Bryan Democrats were celebrating the
anniversary of Lincoln's birth. While Mr.
Lentz was speaking Mr. Bryan entered
the hall in company with Robert Treat
Paine. He was greeted by the vast audi
ence rising to its feet and cheering for
several minutes. At the conclusion of Mr.
Lentz's address, at 10:10 o'clock. Mr.
Bryan was Introduced. The first part of
hi 3 remarks were addressed to Repub
licans, who were informed that the party
had changed its principles since the days
of Lincoln. Later, he took up the subject
of imperialism, the gold standard and
trusts, assailing -each along the lines al
ready indicated In his speeches.
ENDS A LIFE OF
SHAME WITH POISON
Bosita Gonzalez, a "Woman of the
Half World, Swallows Carbolic
Acid With Fatal Effect.
"I have waited for him long enough
now; I am tired of life."
With these words Rosita Keller, known
among her associates as Roska Gonza
lez, a young Mexican woman of the half
world, swallowed the contents of a two
ounce vial of carbolic acid last evening
In her room at a lodging house on the
southwest corner of Broadway and Stock
ton street. After taking the deadly drug
the woman threw the empty bottle in
the hallway and then sat on the bed in
her room to await death.
The woman was hurriedly driven to the
City Receiving Hospital. She was in an
unconscious condition and efforts to re
store her failed. She died in a few min
utes after reaching the hospital.
Deceased was a married woman and
about 25 years old. For some time past
she has not been living with her husband
and to her associates she confided that her
husband had deserted her and her two
children and had not contributed to their
support for years. The children had been
placed In the Infants' Shelter, while the
mother supported them and herself on the
earnings or her shame. The lodgers In
the house say that for some time the
woman had been keeping company with
a young man. but of late he has not been
to visit her and they believe for this rea
son the unfortunate woman took her lite.
A note addressed to the matron In charge
of the Infants' Shelter was found in the
woman's room. It was a request to find
a good home for her little ones.
The woman has made many previous
attempts to commit suicide.

Says Or. Pancoast, "is one of the
surest Indications of a diseased
condition of the Kidneys."
The number of men and women dying daily from "heart failure" is appalling.
"I nrough the failure of the kidneys to properly perform their functions, extra work
put upon the heart and lungs with the result that these great organs wear out be-
iore they ought to. Shortness of breath indicates kidney trouble. Warner's Safe

79%rs York Stck Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. M.â The etock market
threw eff it* lethargy and inertness to-flay
In a very impressive manner. There wu quite
an active demand for stock* from the start In
the ehope of buying orders accumulated over
eight, and the demand gathered volume and
urgency pretty steadily throughout the day.
The rise was so considerable at so ie points
as to Invite prcfit taking, but offering* on this
account were absorbed with Â«jch confidence j
that the selling soon ceased and the market
closed with an upward course of prices and
burst of animation at the best prices of the
day. Although -there was substantial Increase
in "what Wall rtreet called outside Interest, the
market riust still be described as larcely pro
leÂ«t-ior.al. The strength was also to a great ex
tent epotty. That is to say, ccrr.slaratlve.iy few
etocks or groups of stocks rose buoyantly, while I
the large part of the list moved In a more se
date manner, but still upward. While this is
true of a perspective view of the whole market,
there was nevertheless a notable broadening out
In Â»peculativÂ«? Interest. It ha* been manifest for
some lime that the floating supply of stocks
v ..- email and that prices moved easily on any
considerable demand. Hut the obvious unwill
ingness ol prices to go down and the determined
Ignoring of dejireei-infr Influences reflected from
the London market have reemed until to-day
to be viewed with apathy by the upeculative
public. These evenis have, of course, tended
to build ui> a confidence in the nubility of
values, and apparently It needed only some
rpex?ial Incident to crystallize sentiment into an
active buying movement. The action of the
directors at the American Steel and Wire Com
pany >Â«>Bteniay In setting aside a years divi
dend for the common block at the rate of 7 per
rent and the handsome showing presented in
the balance-sheet of last year's business was
the effective incident. There was a rush to buy
American Steel and Wire Et the opening, and
quotation* were a full point apart on running
eale*. The clock wsored a subsequent advmice
which carr">d it u;> an extreme five points. Its
net gain Ir 3%. This aKKressive strength had
a marked Ejrr.;>ath<-tic influence on all the metal
etocks, all the more l*-caune of the depression
which they have long suffered. ThÂ«re was a
large demand from another sort in the interior
and the prevailing cold weather resulted in a
i-udden Jump In the price of coalers.
In the railroad lift, the grangers and all the
Pacific and Southwestern stocks were In nota.b!e
demand, but the whole lift was stronif. The
only thing to account for the sudden drop of
11% in Plttsburg, C. C. and St. Louis was a
report of a new Pltteburg-Chicago line In
contemplation. Chesapeake and Ohio was
heavy, perhaps In fyrcpathy. The first two
hours of trailing recorded &p many ealrs at the
recent Â»\-erage for a full day's buelnÂ«rsi>. While
the market Is still largely DrofeieloriaJ, the
ctJlber of the operator* le obviously much
heavier than those recently in ei-l<lÂ»nce. ::.::

LOCAL MARKETS.
TO ARRIVE.
CHICAGO, Jan. 80.â May wheat opened at 69
<S69Hc. compared with yesterday's close at
6SHS69%e. Liverpool's advance was a disap
pointment and Paris was decidedly lower,
which Influenced considerable selling.
May gradually receded to CS%c, where trade,
which had been fairly active, became quiet and
for some time the market fluctuated between
that figure and 68\@6S%c, the latter mark be
ing touched by the May option upon Brad
street's announcement of a heavy decrease In
the visible. On the Ijeels of this, however,
came a report from Liverpool that La Plata
wheat was being offered lower than American.
It was further asserted that the plague in
Argentina would not materially curtail ex
ports from that country. The heavy liquida
tion which followed these reports sent May
to C7T4, at which It closed on a very weak
market. lH'gl^c under yesterday.
The corn market was dull and lower. May
closing at the bottom Vie under yesterday.
Oats were quiet and without feature. May
closed at the bottom %c depressed.
Provision* were weak and lower. The weak
ness of hogs was partly responsible for this,
but the report of the Orange Judd Farmer
that there were six-tenths more hogs in the
country now than at the same period last year,
was the main consideration. May pork closed
12!ic under yesterday. May lard 5@7%c lower
and May ribs 5^7%c down.

hearty reception.
SALMON PRICES MAY RISE.
Combine of British Columbia Canner
ies Will Cause Higher Figures.
Private letters have been received In this
city concerning the combination made by
the salmon canners of British Columbia.
The letters set forth substantially the fol
lowing as the facts of the case: There
are about forty canneries concerned They
have two purposes in combining. One Is
to lessen expenses. The other Is to pre
vent the cutting of prices. While some
matters connected with the affair are still
Indefinite, the proposition is generally to
shut down part of the canneries and to
operate the others under one management.

Discuss the Philosophy of Their The
ories at Loughead Hall.
The San Francisco Single Tax Society
held a public meeting last night at Loug
head Hall. IGOS Polk street, at which musi
cal numbers and single tax philosophy
divided the honors of the programme.
Charles K. Stein presided, as well as
talked upon single tax theories In a gen
eral way. Alfred Crldge spoke upon "Sin
gle Tax vs. War." His conclusions were
that all war was for aggrandizement and
thus the tax question was materially con
concerned In it.
Miss Qulnn and Miss Alice Bolton sang
several times between the oratorical ef
forts of the speakers.
FAREWELL TO DR. RADER.
Testimonial Tendered the Clergyman
at Young Men's Christian
Association.
The testimonial benefit which the
friends of Rev. William Rader extended
to that gentleman last night in the au
ditorium of the Y. M. C. A. building
proved an unqualified success In every
particular. The benefit was got up by the
frlenfis of the popular minister in order
to bid him bon voyage on the trip he is
about to undertake, and at the same time
to effer him some substantial token of the
esteem in which he is held by those
whom he haa labored among. â¢: .-
Dr. Rader will leave for the East as
toon as he can get his affairs arranged
to penr.it of his ttuking a vacation, and
will sail from New York for Europe,
where he will remain from six to eight
mor.ths. Most of this time the reverend
gentleman will pass In England, as It Is
his intention to devote as much of his
vacation as possible to a course of study
w hich he will pursue at Oxford. He will
find an opportunity, however, for a
short run over to Paris and to one or
two of the principal titles of the Conti
nent.
The propramme of the entertainment
last night was under the direction of Rev.
GÂ«*org<Â» Aflams and was excellently ren
dered in every particular. It was as fol

Ah Hlng and Silk Jim, two highbinders,
who were convicted Saturday by Judge
Megan on the charge of carrying a con
cealed weapon In the shape of a revolver,

purpose, and he would Impose a fine of
$500 upon each, with the alternative of six
menths In the County Jail.

same time there will be a fixed price to be
paid to the fishermen for fish. The amount
of money in the deal Is not made public.
Competition has cut the rates for the
goods In some Instances, and the canners

The comments of the salmon canners
who have offices In this city are to the ef
fect that the move In British Columbia
will be likely to benefit them. Prices will
rise for the British Columbia output. The
effect of the combine must be in that di

GEORGE POETZ
MAY GO FREE
Employers LenientCon
cerningthe Robbery.
George Poetz. the boy collector for C. T2.
Whitney & Co., who resorted to a stupid
trick of claiming he had been robbrd to
hide his crime, appeared before Judge
Mogan yesterday. His eyes were shielded*
by a pair of Blue glasses and he held his
hat In front of his face. He explained to
the Judge that he had been awake all
night and his eyes could not stand the
light. Poetz had been charged with grand
larceny, and he was Instructed ana ar
raigned by the Judge. He asked for a
continuance, as he wanted to get in at
torney, and Â«ald that he believed his em
ployers would not prosecute him. The
Judge continued the case till Friday.
There Is a strong likelihood that the
boy's employers will refuse to prosecute
him. In fact, neither Arthur L. Whitney
nor Edward Pond, who constitute the firm
of C. E. Whitney & Co.. has sworn to a
complaint, and so far as they are con
cerned Poetz need have no fear of prnlng
to prison for his offense. When Mr. Pond
was seen last night he declined to say
whether his firm would appear against
the boy. He expressed himself as full of
sympathy for Poetz. and says that it was
on his authority that the boy refused to
talk about the case. He claimed that the
sum buried by Poetz was less than JO3O.
the checks for $1370 having been stopped
at the bank. The detectives claim tli;Â».t
Poetz took the coin to cover up a pre
vious defalcation of $627, but this is denied
by his employer, who says that Poetz's
accounts are correct to a cent.
"Neither Mr. Whitney nor myself," sail
Mr. Pond, "were anxious to lock Poetz up.
but the detectives insisted upon It. and. In
fact, the records will show that Detectives
Cody and Gibson are the complainants.
The boy was evidently out of his mind
when he committed the deed, or else he
acted under some extraordinary Impulse
which ho could not resist. The story of
the robbery was so straightforward that
I would have believed it implicitly hid he
not confessed. Why, he had $1300 In gold
coin which he had collected from a bakery
firm earlier In the day, which our cashier
received from him by appointment. Now
he might have taken that money In addi
tion to the other. As to the boy leading
a gay life, that is absurd. lie had no bad
habits, and on Investigation we find that
he owes but $7 In small debts. Our firm
has not lost a single cent through Poetz.
of whom we thought very highly, and we
sincerely hope that no harm will result to
him from his thoughtless escapade. If
Mr. Whitney or myself decline to talk
when we are called as witnesses It an
pears to me that a case cannot be made
against the boy. but I do not care to say
if that will be cur method of procedure in
the case."

the manner in which he sustained his
facial injuries. "I charged him with try-
Ing to do me out of it, and then he threw
me through the window of his residence
at 71C Jackson street."
The affair is shrouded in mystery. Cap
tain George L. Gibson and wife reside at
716 Jackson street and Mrs. Gibson to-day
declared sÂ«he knew nothing of any quarrel
in her house.
"William Gibson," she said, "is an uncle
of my husband, residing in Nebraska, but
I don't know that he was hurt. And
surely,"' she continued, smiling, "there
has been no one thrown through any
window in this house."
On the second floor of the Gibson resi
dence, however, there appears to be a
broken window.
Mrs. Gibson declared she knew nothing
about any misunderstanding that might
have taken place In her home. She said
her husband hud gone of! this morning
on his vessel and he was certainly not in
jured.
CAHILL FINALLY
DIVORCED FROM
HIS CRUEL WIFE
Bitter Contest Has
Ended.
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Jan. 33.
Four times and out! After three futile
attempts In the divorce courts, Christo
pher J. Cahiil and Margaret P. Cahill
have been legally perorated at lapt.
For the pa^t three years the Cahillsâ
who are among the prominent residents
of Dimond. Fruitvale â have been trying
to dissolve the matrimonial bonds that
had become distasteful to both, Mrs. Ca
hill being the plaintiff usually.
The las=t time Mrs. Cahill sued for a
divorce she made capital out of the fact
that one evening:, when she was enter
taining one Sinkowltz. an expressman,
who was helping to support her family.
Mr. Cahill appeared on the scene and
threatened to thrash him. but Slnkowitz
declined to be thrashed and drove Cahill
from the houso at the point of a revolver.
}'Â»ut Christopher Cahill proved that his
wife had secured a lead pencil deed to
all of his property. Judge Greene, on that
occasion, refused to prrant Mrs. Cahill a
decree until she should return the prop
* rty to her husband. She refused and
tlie parties went outside and made up,
iird no decree was forthcoming.
Then it was Christopher's turn to file
suit. He claimed there was no living with
Ms worse half: that shf made unpleasant
demonstrations with cups and saucers,
find wa.fi cruel In the extreme.
Late this afternoon Judge Ellsworth
granted the divorce to Christopher Cahill,
the wife not having found time to an
pwer, and to plaintiff was awarded the
custody of two childrenâ Christopher and
Ir*Â»ne. " But the property, it appears, re
rjains with the wife.

Wants to Earn Enough to Get Home.
Louis Richards, a mining man pt Grass
Valley, visited the chambers of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday and made a piti
ful request to be allowed an opportunity
to work for the city until he had earned
enough money to pay for his passage
home. He claimed that he recently came
to this city with $60 in his pocket, which
he had earned at his occupation as a
miner, but in an unguarded moment he
had succumbed to the wiles of two sirens
In the Thalia Music Hall on Market
Btreet. and as a consequence he was now
penniless in a strange city. Richards
lingered in the corridors for several
hours, but was offered no encouragement
and he finally went away.

against Mrs. Rebecca Greenan, prin
cipal of the Sunnydale School. Eighteen

FORCE TO BE REDUCED.
Board of Public Works Begins to Be
trench.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
received a report from Commissioner Ma
hony In which he recommended that she
number of carpenters employed should
not exceed four. Including M. Doyle, whom
the Fire Department will carry on its pay
roll, but asks that he be appointed head
carpenter by the board without compen
sation.
Mr. Mahony is also convinced that the
working of material by the machinery in
the shop Is not the most economical way
to have It done, and an agreement should
be made In advance with one of the many
private planing mills, and the cost greatly
reduced thereby. Both recommendations
were adopted by the board.
The services of the watchman at the
carpenter shop were ordered dispensed
with after January 31 on account of the
proximity of one of the engine houses.
The following petitions were referred to
the Bureau of Ptreets: From the Western
Addition Improvement Club, requesting
that Bush street be thoroughly recon
structed and placed in good condition:
from the West of Castro Street Improve
ment Club, calling attention to the bad
condition of the crossing at the Intersec
tion of Twenty-third and Diamond Btre*t3.

DIED OF POISON.
Verdict of a Coroner's Jury in Case
of William Hollingsworth.
The chemical analysis of the content*
of the stomach of William Holltngsworth
was presented to Coroner Cole yesterday,
and, 88 everybody already knew, the re
port was that Hollingsworth had died
from a potion of cyanide of potassium.
The jury returned a verdict that Hoilinfjs
worth had died from the effects of the
l>c!Eon. "administered by parties unknown
to the jury."
Hollingsworth was a etran.ied miner
who put up at the New Western Hotel.
He was despondent, purchased the cya
nide, got drunk and took the poison on
January 20. A package of the drug and
a glass which had contained a solution of
the poison lay on a- chair . the head of
the bed. HollingÃWorth was *j drunk that
it was with considerable difficulty that the
employes of the hotel put him to bed. In
helping him along the hallway he fall
over a sewing machine and broke one of
his legs, but this injury was not known
until the autopsy was made. The evi
dence was overwhelming that the de
ceased had committed suicide, but the
jurors, one of whom signed his name with
a cross, left the question of suicide In
doubt.

RIVAL OF
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
American Association of Base
ball Clubs Comes Into
Existence.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 30.-The Ameri
can Association of Baseball Clubs was or
ganized her to-day. The Continental
Hotel, where the meeting was held, was
crowded with baseball men from nearl>
every section of the country in which the
national game Is played professionally.
When the meeting was called to order
by President Quin there were present:
H. D. Quin, H. C. Ravener and J. D.
â¢O'Brien, Milwaukee; Thomas B. Harlan
and G. P. Hoeck, St. Louis; Frank Rich
ter. Philadelphia; Thomas McCarthy and
John Drew, Boston; John McGraw, Con
way W. Sams and Phil Peterson, Balti
more; Adrian C. Anson, Chicago; 11. D.
Quin (by proxy), Detroit. The New York
representative, who came over last night,
returned home to-day for instructions.
President Quin said he regarded the
statement that the National League would
place another association in the field to
antagonize the American Association as
a bluff. He intimated that it was to be a
fight to a finish, and quoted the case of
McGraw as significant proof. McGraw,
he said, was scheduled for sale by Hun
lon & Co. at $14,000, the player to receive
$7000 of the purchase money. This, with
1 is salary ofJf-000, he threw aside to Join
forces with the new association. Mr. Quin
asserted that the American Association
would have no reserve clubs.
The circuit as made up to-day Includes
Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore, in
the East, and Chicago", Detroit, Milwau
kee and St. Louis, In the West. Applica
tions from Providence and New York
have been received, and one of these
cities will surely be selected at the meet
ing to-morrow.
One of the most Important things done
to-day was the adoption of a resolution
that each city which is granted a fran
chise must deposit $5000 as a guarantee
that the club Is acting in good faith.
Each city Is willing to deposit that
amount.

DISPLEASED THE
FRENCH CABINET
Allowances of Bishops
Suspended.
PARIS, Jan. 30.â A Cabinet council, at
which President Loubet presided, consid
ered to-day the action of Cardinal Rich
ard, the Archbishop of Paris, in openly
visiting the Assumptlonist Fathers after
the Correctional Tribunal had pronounced
the dissolution of the order and the sub
sequent steps taken by the Government.
The Premier, M. Waldeck-Rousseau, read
his letter requesting Cardinal Richard to
explain, together with the prelate's reply,
declaring that his visit had no political
character, recalling hfs habitual attitude
and defending himself against the charge
of hostility to the repuoiic. To this the
Premier replied that it Cardinal Richard's
explanation led him to consider the ac
count Of his visit published in La Oroix
incorrect, nevertheless he was compelled
to condemn the Cardinal for his unusual
step. The Government, he added, had de
cided to suspend the stipends of those
bishops and priests who wrote letters to
the Assumptlonists containing protests in
compatible with the respect due the work
cf Justice.
As a result of the council. Premier Wal
deck-Rousseau has suspended the allow
ances of the Archbishop of Aix, the Bish
ops of Versailles, Valence, Vlvlers, Tulle
and Montpelier, and the Vicar of Vignor.
The Cabinet also came to decisions re
specting various bills to carry out the
naval scheme, and these M. Waldeck-Rous
seau introduced at the opening of the
Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. They
were referred at his request to the Budget
Commission.
The Government navy bill asks for
76,000,000 francs for the fleet and provides
six tlrst-class battleships, five armored
cruisers, twenty-nine torpedo boat de
stroyers, 112 torpedo boats and twenty-six
submarine boats. It asks for 140,000.000
francs to defend the coasts, Including
38,000.000 francs for the defense of Blzarte.

of Tunis.
Another bill provides for the establish

the total expenditure up to 900.000.00U

No Football at Stanford.
BERKELEY. Jan. SOâ There will be r.o
Intercollegiate football games at Stanford.
At least not between the teams or Stan
ford University and the University of
California. This was decided at a meeting
cf the athletic committee of the Associa
tion of Students of the Berkeley college
to-night. It was declared that a game
could not be played at Stanford without
rlfk of a great financial loss, which Stan
lord was In no position to guarantee
against. It was contended that all an
nual contests must be fought at either
Berkeley or San Francisco to insure a
crowd adequate to make them paying
venture!" For this reason the agreement
reached last Saturday between represen
tatives of the two universities providing
that the annual football games between
the two teams should be held at each uni
versity town every alternate year was re
i.'ifiiated. The agreement in regard to
t-^me of the provisions governing tield-day
exercises was also condemned. This was
done on the ground that some of the

Unusual Services Over
a Body.
i^P^clal Dlsi>atch to ThÂ» Call.
6ASJ RAFAEL, Jan. 30â News of a
double funeral, attended by unusual cir
(cmstanos. reached hero to-day from
Sonoma. Some days ago William Taylor.
a mulatto in the employ of the Union
Hotel of Sonoma. <Jl<-d of heart disease.
As the man was apparently friendless
ar.d penniless, an undertaker offered to
inter Taylors remains for the wages
which were due him. Twelve hours after
his dtath, in a box of cheap pine boards,
the mulatto's remains were interred in
bx\ obscure corner of the potter's field In
the Valley Cemetery. As the rain was
pouring down and there seemed no likeli
hood of any interest being taken In the
prave of a friendless negro, the under
taker hastily shoveled a few spadefuls of
?Â¦arth on the wretched coffin and drove
away. _
Then the Sonoma Athletic Club, of
which body Taylor was a prominent
member, heard of his death, and an in
vestigation was made. After some diffi
culty the gTave of thÂ«Â» unfortunate man
wop found, partly filled with water. The
coffin waÂ« removed from the grave and
taken into town. The next day. after
placards announcing the event had been
plentifully distributed, the second funeral
of William Taylor took place. This time,
however, the members of the club walked
bareheaded in front of the body of their
departed friend. Magnificent wreaths,
the tribute of many prominent citizens,
decked the coffln. At the grave a quartet
rar.g Todi's "Good-By," and while the
cofSn was lowered every head was bared.

STATUS OF INSULAR
POSSESSIONS FIXED
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.--The Republi
cans of the Ways and Means Committee
to-night laid down definite lines upon
which the. Republican leaders of the
House have decided to legislate for Porto
Rico so far as tariff duties are concerned.
The decision reached is exceedingly im
portant, as It commits the Republicans of
the Ways and Means Committee to the
theory that Porto Rico and the Philip
pines are not the territory of the United
States within the meaning of that sec
tion of the constitution . which provides
that customs and revenue laws shall be
uniform throughout the United States.
In other words, it commits them to the
view that our new possessions can be
governed as colonies and that discriminat
ing duties can be laid against them. The
question arose In connection with the bill.
Introduced ten days ago by Representa
tive Pavne of New York, designed to re
move all tariff barriers between Porto
Rico and the United States*â ?ree trade, in
other words. " . ,t., t .
The Republican members of the \\ ays
and Means. Committee, to which the bill
was referred, discussed It at BCVenU secret
meetings and to-day decided to favor a
substitute, which will be offered when the
bill comes up for discussion before the full
committee to-morrow.
ThiÂ« <=ui)Â«titut.= provides that tnrÂ» tariff
of Porto Rico iiÃainst Roods from foreign
countries except the United States shall
Â»>c ;hc Bamo n* that against goods enter-
Ing the I'nitort Slates from such countries
but that goods imported into the I nlted
Stales from Porto Rico or from t.it
I'nitod Stales into Porto Rfoo shall pay
25 r><?r cent of the tariff upon foreign
poods. That '.s. between Porto Rico nnd
the United States there shall be a hori
zontal reduction of 75 per cent In the tar
iff. The substitute also provides that tru
revenue from ruch tariff duties shall be
usÂ«Â»d to defray the expenses of the admin
istration in tho island.
The action of the Republicans to-day
emounts to a decision that the section of
the constitution hereinbefore referred to,
which has been the subject of special In
vestigation by a pub-committeo of tn<?
Wnvs and Means Committee for several
weeks, does not apply to our Insular pos-
Fesslons and that the constitution of the
United States does not extend over them.

EBELL LADIES
WILL DISCUSS
FEDERATION
Call a Special Meeting
for To-Day.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, Jan. 30.
The meeting of the Ebell Society to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock will be one
of the most important events in the his
tory of that prominent organization, for
It will mark either the acceptance or the
rejection of the invitation given the so
ciety to join the California State Federa
tion of Woman's Clubs. . The meeting
will be confined to members of the board,
and from the interest being manifested
for and against federating, it is probable
there will be no vacant chairs. â¢
The chief business on hand. In fact, the
prime object of the session, will be the
hearing of the reports of Mrs. Roland P.
Gleason and Mrs. P. B. Gunn; the dele
gates chosen by the society to attend the
convention of woman's clubs In Los An
geles two weeks ago. Though half a
month has passed since the close of the
southern assemblage, the Ebell Society's
representatives have not before had an
opportunity of officially informing their
organization of the doings at thebigmeet
ing. nor their impressions of it, nor the
part they took.
The board will hear with special Inter
est the report of Mrs. Gleason, who went
to Los Angeles rather prejudiced against
federation, and returned not only entirely
changed in her attitude toward it, but a
temporary officer, having been chosen a
district vice president of the Federated
Clubs. Mrs. Gleason gives as reasons for
her conversion the conservative non-par
tisan womanly constitution that was
adopted. This constitution, puts no po
litical, religious or factional reasons for
ward as the excuse of Its formation, but
reasons that are purely educational, lo
cally patrioticâ such as improvments and
the likeâ and artistic. And the popular
president of the Ebell Society says the
most conservative member of her club
can accept the adpoted constitution with
out feeling that federation will ever
mean an entrance Into unpleasant, con
tests, either State or local.
The society twice voted federation
down, and has quietly suppressed any
ardent action In its favor. Only club
courtesy made delegates seem necessary
at the Los Angeles meeting.

allel to It to be found In the history of the
country.
Though often In th^ past the scene of
bloody and fatal encounters between Indi
viduals In settlement of personal griev
ances, the capital city of Frankfort has
never before seen such as this. The as
sassination of Judge Elliott. In the seven
ties, by Colonel Buford, a disappointed
litigant. Is the only event In the history of
the city or the State of Kentucky that
approaches it. In lack of personal respon
sibility and provocation on the part of the
victim and cold-blooded purpose and
preparation on the part of the assassin.
The last election In Kentucky was one
of the most hotly contested In the political
annals of the State, and that there has
not been bloodshed before Is not due to
the absence of hot blood and bitter feel
ing, but rather that when once begun
there was no telling when or where the
trouble would stop. The men of both
parties, while thoroughly prepared ami
eager for a fray, were reluctant to be the
ones to start it.
The excitement Incident to the canvass
and election hud well subsided when the
State Board o( Canvassers (Democratic;,
composed of Judge Pyor, Captain illlia
and Air. Payntz. after a canvass of the
returns decided that \V. S. Taylor had re
ceived the greatest number of votes and
gave him a certificate of election. Taylor
was duly inaugurated as Governor, and
John Marshall as Lieutenant Governor.
The filing of the notices of contest caused
a renewal of the excitement, and grave
apprehension as to the outcome, on the
part of those who were familiar with the
situation and knew Lie temper of the
people concerned on both sides. Under
the constitution of the State the General
Assembly, while having ths power to es
tablish contesting boards for every other
elective offlce. never had the power or dis
cretion to do so In case of a contested
election for Governor or Lieutenant Gov
ernor, but it has always been provided for
In the organic law.
When the Legislature convened the
Democrats had a majority In both houses,
but not enough margin in joint assembly
to insure the constitutional majority
necessary to unseat the acting Governor
and seat his opponent. A number of con
tests for seats In the Assembly had al
ready been filed before Goebel filed his
notice of contest Committees In each
case had been appointed and for the pa.-;t
week or more nave been making tht-ir
reports, which were generally acted upon
by the House on the merits of each case,
though the result vas favorable to the
Democrats and foreshadowed what would
be the final action of the Joint assembly
on the report of the committee in the
Goebel-Taylor and Markh-un-Marshall
cases for Governor and Lieutenant Gov
ernor. Their action would be final. If in
favor of Goebel upon his taking the oath
of offlce he would be thf legal Governor
and Taylor would be powerless to do any
official act and not entitled to recognition
by the Legislatrue or any Judicial, civil
or military officer In the Statet
MILITIA AND GUNS
READY FOR ACTION
FRANTORT, Ky., Jan. 30.â Three hun
dred men of the Second Kentucky Infan
try were camped around the Capitol
buildings to-night, and 1500 more are ex
pected during the night and. before noon
to-morrow.
"Word was received from Louisville Le
gion that the First Kentucky Regiment
would bring with It a Oatllng frua.
The Gatllnp; gun of the Lexington com
pany was posted Just to the west of the
Capitol steps, and a tall sergeant who had
It In charge had carefully calculated the
range to a. row of small stores and dwell
ing houses south of the Capitol grounds.
For weeks it has been the story that
when an attack should be made upon
the State Government by the dlacontenttd
of either party the firing would com
mence from the upper windows of theso
houses.
The evening 1 trains did not bring 1 as large
a crowd of people as was expected. Word
had been received from Covington. Ky. .
the home of Mr. Goebel. that a large
crowd would be down, but not more than
a score of people came in, and they were
not of the class that create disturbances.
Numerous inquiries were received by
members of the Lezislature from their
constituents, asking If they were needed.
In all cases word was sent back that no
body was needed and that crowds least of
all things were needed Just now. Several
small places In the neighborhood nf
Frankfort sent- In a man or two to obtain
a general Idea of the situation and carry
the report back.
In every case thÂ» messenger, whether
Democrat or Republican, was sent back
with the word that now was a good time
to keep out of Frankfort.
Â«
RECEIPT OF THE NEWS
AT THE NATIONAL CAPITAL
WASHTXOTOX. Jan. SOâ The news of
the attempted assassination of Goebel in
Kentucky was received at the national
capital with dpep regrret. A grreat many
Senators feared that there would be a
bloody outcome on account of the bitter
feeling that has existed before and since
the election and which has been growins?
In Intensity daily.
In the House the news spread like wild
fire, and was for some time almost the
sole topic of discussion. The report was
received at first with incredulity and after
confirmation with amazement. The mem
bers gathered In gToups to discuss it anÂ»l
there were everywhere expressions of hor
ror that the bitter political contest which
has waged In Kentucky had culminated
In an attempted assassination.
Smith of Kentucky says that John
Whlttaker, who has been arrested, cornea
from Governor Taylor's district in Ken
tucky. The members of the Kentucky
deleg^itlon did not care to be Interviewed
upon the political effect of the attempted
assassination pending the arrival of com
plete details.

SOFALA HAD
HER REVENGE
ON DUNFREE
Schreiber's Filly Earns Another
Pair of Bracketsâ Long
Shots First at Oakland,
Barney Schreiber'i fast filly Sofala
turned the tables on Dunfree In the two
year-old dash at Oakland track yester
day. When the pair met on Thursday of
last week Thorpe astride Dunfree. beat
the barrier, which advantage gained at
the commencement enabled him to win
by a narrow margin. Yesterday, ruling a
7 to 10 favorite, Bullman rushed Schreib
er's young miss to the front . and she
downed the Burns & Waterhouse young
ster with consummate ease, scoring her
fifth victory.
It was "outsiders' day," Gotobed and
Sofala being the only successful favorites.
Antler, at odds of 40 to 1, was the star
long-shot performer. â¢ ,'
A bunch of about six finished heads and
necks apart on the wire In the opening
five and a half furlong scramble. Antler,
a 40 to 1 shot, gained the verdict, with a
dead heat for place between My Dear and
Hunch. Lew Zara went to the post favor
ite, showed speed but tired the last one
hundred yards.
J. F. Fogg's bay horse, Gotobed, fell
in with easy game in the mile and a six
tor-nth run, decided under selling condi
tions. The ring held him a 1 to 2 chance,
and with Jenkins in the saddle won very
cleverly from Glengaber, the third choice.
None Such, a 150 to 1 shot, ran third.
With Satsuma pounds below his real
form the smart ones picked Tempo to win
the mile and three furlong run. Before
half the route had been traversed Henry
on Snips showed first and the Fellow
charm mare held her advantage to the
wire, beating. Tempo out over a length.
Satsuma was third, downed a head for
place honors. The winner ran within a
quarter of a second of the coast record.
"Honest" Dodd's colt, L. B. McWhirter,
furnfshed the surprise In the seven-fur
long event for three-year-olds. A 12 to-1
Bhot, with Vlttitce up, he. came from the
rear, getting up just in time to nip San
Tomas, the favorite, a head on the post.
Saul .of Tarsus took third money from the
evenly ridden Silver Bullion.
No doubt the warmest thing of the
afternoon was Regelong, from Fred Fos
ter's'stable. The half-brother to Sullrosa
went to the post a 7 to 5 favorite for the
closing five and a. half furlong scramble,
played down from 4. After a long delay
he became very fractious, falling to finish
among the first three. Matt Hogan. a
6 to 1 shot, outgamed J. V. Hays, win
ning by a neck.
Track Notes.
Paplnta, with her latest English trap
and handsome bays. Is almost a dally
spectator of the racing at Oakland. The
peerless queen of mirror dancing:, who Is
now filling an engagement at the Or
pheum Theater, Is a great admirer of the
thoroughbred, never missing an oppor
tunity of witnessing the sport. With a
small fortune invested In fashionable
turnouts as well as being the owner of a
ranch In this State the charming little
woman terms California home.
Jockey Logue, when he landed Antler
first, left the maiden class of riders. He
is in the employ of Atkins & Lottridge.
There was no sense or reason in keeping
the horses at the post in the last race so
long. Because Isaline was bet on and
happens to be a bad actor is no reason
for the chances of every other starter be
ing killed off waiting for her.

voice, asking that a vote be immediately
taken on it. President Newhall said he
declined to vote and Dr. McNutt aroused
himself out of his sleep long enough to
aÂ«k that the application be placed on file.
The charges against Officer B. J. Rooker
wc-re dismissed.
The trial of Officer Conley, accused of
being Inebriated while on duty, was put
over one week.
Mock Woh, who applied for /a permit to
act as a Chinese guide, was turned down.
Chief Btggy asserted that he was strongly
opposed to the Chinese acting as guides
as they were unreliable.
After transacting a large amount of
minor business the board went into execu
tive ReeÃion and when it adjourned Com
missioner Newhall stated that another at
tempt to elect a chief had signally failed.

which was appointed to visit the State Nor

ing performed that duty and reported back
the result of their Investigations to the Sen
ate, now present this, their account for
mileage, as follows: Senator Androus, 1190
miles, Ul9; Senator Biggy, 1248 miles,
$128 40; Senator Gesford. 1240 miles, $124; J.
F. Carrere, clerk, 1240 miles, $124. Total,
$49S 40.
Therefore, resolved. That the Controller
be and is hereby directed to draw his war
rant In favor of S. N. Androus, chairman of
said sub-committee, for the sum of $435 40,
as per above statement, said warrant to be
so drawn upon the fund for the contingent
expenses of the Senate, and the Treasurer Is
directed to pay the same.
S. N. ANDROUS,
Chairman Sub-Committee.
In addition Mr. Biggy offers two
receipts from the Southern Paciilc
Railroad Company's agents show
ing that for his trip from Sac
ramento to Los Angeles he paid $15 fare,'
and for his trip from Los Angeles to Sac
ramento, on the return, he paid $15. The
Call reproduces with this article fac sim
iles of the two receipts, together with tho
Southern Pacific agent's stamp on the
back, showing that the return ticket was
purchased at Los Angeles February 5, 1595.
This date fits perfectly the date, Febru
ary 7, 1895, of the report of Chairman
Androus on the return to Sacramento of
the sub-committee.
No further evidence would be necessary
in a court of law to run out of court such
preposterous charges as are sought to be
backed up, for whatever reason, by Mr.
Isidore Jacobs. His memory Is not corrob
orated by that of Senator Fay, whom he
cites as a witness, and it is absolutely
contradicted by the evidence of the Sen
ate Journal and the receipts held by Mr.
Biggy for fares paid on the trip In ques
tion.
In the face of this proof no one
would think that Mayor Phelan,
unblushing breaker of ante-election
promises as he is, will dare to bury
his official knife in the back of Biggy. In
the face of such proof Esola, alias Har
rington, and his backers will again have
to hunt the holes into which they were
driven by the absent-minded lieutenant's
testimony on the witness stand before the
Police Commissioners. In the face of Mich
proof Commissioner Biggy comes forth ra
diant, an honest man, that had foresight
enough to pay his fare and get receipts
and keep them to refute just such charges.
Commissioner Biggy's attitude through
out this trying ordeal has been consist
ently that of the honest man. the Exam
iner professed at one time to think him.
He did not rush into print to deny the
charges. He would only say, "The re
ceipts will shoÂ«w." Â¦â¢ - y

denounce the shooting In the most un
measured terms. Governor Taylor imme
diately caused a email address to be
issued, in which he declared the affair
to be a disgrace and an outrage and call
ing for the most sober condemnation. He
cent orders at once to Adjutant General
Collier, directing him to take steps for
the preservation of order. General Col
lier is a Republican and Is opposed to
Goebel. He declared the shooting to be
a most cowardly affair and one that upon
every consideration was to be regretted.
He lost no time in making speeches, how
ever. Before Goebel had been lifted from
the ground to be carried to the hotel. Gen
eral Collier had telephoned to the armory,
a half-miie distant, directing the local in
fantry company which was stationed there
under command of Captain Walcott to
proceed at once to the Capitol grounds,
take possession of them and the ap
proaches, allowing nobody to enter the
gates. Twenty minutes after the shooting
Captain Walcott and his men marched
across the front of the Capitol building
and halted at the foot of the stops. Or
ders were Issued to outside companies
throughout the State to make ready at
once to come to Frankfort, the entire
State Guard being called into service. It
was feared that theÂ»news of the shooting
would so inflame the Democrats that they
would come to Frankfort in swarms,
while the mountaineers would lose no time
in coming to the capltol for the purpose
of upholding their party principles. .
"It mokeÃ no difference" to me," said
General Collier, "who- starts anything;
we will preserve order on both sides."
The excitement among the followers of
Goebel was great, and for a short time
Immediately following the shooting of
their leader there was more than the pos
sibility that some of the hotheads would
seek vengeance upon their political ene
mies. Threats were made against Repub

Legislature soon brought them to calmer
talk. As the news spread through the

And now. in fac simile. The Call offers
the receipts, repeating Mr. Biggy's re-
mark. "The receipts will show."
IT has been charged by an afternoon
newspaper, which is given away with
the drinks, that Acting Chief of Po- ]
lice and Commissioner William J.
Biggy, after having ridden on a
Southern Pacific pass on State
business, while Senator from San Fran
cisco, afterward collected mileage for the
Journey. The charge was based on an
interview with Isidore Jacobs of the Cali
fornia Canneries ' Company, during the
course of which he is quoted as saying
that some time during the legislative ses
sion of 1595, at a restaurant at.
Sacramento, Biggy told Jacobs that he
had ridden on a Southern Pacific pass as
a member of the Senate Sub-Committe*
on Public Buildings on a visit of inspec.
tion from Sacramento to the Whlttier Re
form School.
Supplemental to this Interview was
quoted that paragraph of the constitution
of the State, which frowns on and pro
vides penalties for any such proceeding.
Following, too, was an Interview headed
"Biggy Is Evasive," In which the ac
cused, questioned as to the truth of Mr.
Jacobs' charges, replied that "the re
ceipts would speak for themselves." To
a reporter for The Call, on the evening
of the publication, Mr. Biggy denied the
charges absolutely, remarking that he did
not care to notice the paper making them.
The kind-hearted Examiner, which does
not like Blggy any more since he refused
to be made a catspaw to serve the ambi
tions of the absent-minded Frederick
Esola; alias Harrington, saw yesterday
morning, or pretended to see, something
serious in the charges made by the even
ing paper against Commissioner Biggy.
It suddenly discovered that the evening
paper, which it has more than once ac
cused of venality, had suddenly become
the recording angel of righteousness. In
big, black type it rehashed the charges,
while in very small type it printed, "The
Examiner has no knowledge of the truth
of this particular charge." Incidentally,
and In the full face of this Innocent ac
knowledgment, it worked off a three-col
umn cartoon, representing Biggy making
ready to stick a knife into the back of
Mayor Phelan, labeling It, "Whose Hired
Stabber Is This?"
It became evident to the friends of Com
missioner Biggy that a well-laid plan was
in full swing against him. More than one
surmised that the attack had originated
wiJi the backers of Esola and, for pur
poses which are apparent, was first de
livered through the afternoon paper that
is given away with the drinks, so that
the immaculate Examiner could not be
accused of having made it for the purpose
of getting back at Biggy by reason of his
opposition to itÃ perjured candidate for
Chief of Police.
It was a boldly c6nceived and well con
sidered scheme, especially ! the cartoon
afterthought. Biggy's friends, sure of the
honesty of the man whom the Examiner
has lain awake nights to exclaim is hon
est, liked it, only they could not help re
marking that it would have been truer
to life had the figures been reversed. Some
of them went further, and stated plainly
that the truth was that the pure Mayor
Phelan was preparing to knife Biggy and
that the attacks on the Commissioner's
honvsty were made solely and only to give
Political Purity Phelan a chance to oust
Biggy from ottice and put in some servile
tool to deliver the goods the little Mayor
of this big city had sold prior to election.
In this connection. The Call does not
mean to charge that Isidore Jacobs Is a
party to the plot. It would rather believe
otherwise andâ in the face of absolute
proofs in its possession that Commissioner
Biggy is innocent of the charges in the
interviewâ this paper will take the char
itable view that Mr. Jacobs is simply mis
taken. However that may be, it seems
that Mr. Jacobs is taking a very lively in
terest against Mr. Biggy, coming out yes
terday afternoon in the paper that is
given away with the drinks, to back his
assertions with living witnesses. He is
quoted as saying: "To substantiate my
statement, 1 am compelled to mention the
name of 'Honest* John Fay, who was ai
that time a Senator from this city. Â¦ Sen
ator Fay was present at that dinner when
Mr. Biggy made the confession."
Senator Fay was seen immediately af
terward at his residence, 2114 Powell
street, by a reporter of the same evening
papei and asked whether he remembered
Biggy's alleged confession to Jacobs. His
answer was: "Well, such a thing may
have occurred, but I cannot recall It at
this time." In spite of other questions
the reporter could get nothing further
from 'Honest" John Fay.
So much for the proof of Mr. Jacobs'
statement.
Now for the refutation. . Commissioner
Biggy denies it In toto. He says, to begin
vrith, that he never dined with Jacobs and
never confessed to him or anybody else in
a French restaurant at Sacramento or
anywhere else that he had ridden on a
Southern Pacific pass. He admits, as the
records of the State Senate show, that
he did travel from Sacramento to Los
Angeles and from there to other points
included in the investigation, for . which
the Senate Journal shows he was allowed
mileage. ' He offers alsoâ what the lovely
Examiner offered against himâ the Senate
Journal record of the Junket of the sub
committee. It reads:
SENATE CHAMBER. Sacramento, Feb
ruary 7, 1895. Mr. President: The Special
Sub-committee of the Committee on Public
began to pour toward the Capitol on all
sides, one throng being led by two fire
men, one of whom carried a Winchester
rifle, which the other finally prevailed
upon him to lay asldo.
A shooting affray occurred In a saloon
about this time, Craig Ireland, a sporting
man, fatally wounding Ike Williams, a
negro. The men were in an altercation
when Williams struck" Ireland, who
promtly sent a bullet through the negro's
stomach. Ireland was locked up. This
second shooting caused great excitement
for a time, and it was thought the long
threatened political shooting in general
all along the line had been inaugurated.
This affair had nothing to do with the
political situation.
Senator-elect Blackburn, who was in
Washington, was Informed of the shoot
ing through the long-distance telephone,
and sent back a message urging the
Democrats to remain quiet and take no
rash action of any sort.
It was reported through the city this
afternoon that It was the intention of
Lieutenant Governor John Marshall to re
sign his position because of the shooting
of Goebel. Marshall left toj his home In
Louisville this afternoon.

U ifr^lelivered it at the executive fiMna
of the Commissioners, following the open
Pesslon. As soon as the doors vere closed
on press and public, he offered a resolu
tion instigated by Phelan. asking that tin*
board rescind the res-olution making Higgy
acting Chief of Police, and that it appoint
la his stead, as acting Chief, the president
of the commission. George A. Newhail.
In presenting tne resolution. Commis
sioner Thomas said the Mayor had an
nounced to him hi? determination to re
move Dipgy from the offiVe of Police Com
missioner before next Monday.
Commissioner Hipgy at once asked^ for
the charges against him as Acting Chief
who applied for licenses to sell liquor.
One of the applications was denied out
right and action on the other was post
poned a week until an Investigation into
th*> character of the place can be made.
The cape of Otto Heynemann, the sten
ographer to the Chief of Police charged
with having divulged upper office secrets,
was postponed a week so that the District
Attorney c >uld be Instructed to draw up
a more specific complaint and verify It.
Mr. Heynemann was represented before
the Commissioners by William S. Wood of
thÂ«? firm of Lloyd & Wood, and his broth
er. Attorney Alexander Heynemann. The
accused was prepared to go on with the
hearing and had a number of witnesses
ready to take the stand.
Attorney Wood raised a technical ob
jection at the outset, however, by read
ir.sr a section of the charter which was in
effect that an officer charged with an
offense was entitled to a knowledge of
the off.nse he is accused of and the name
of the person making the charges. At
torney llevnemann stated that he was
anxious to proceed as he was desirous
of removing the stigma hanging over his
brother. He asked that the name of the
man to whom the secret was revealed be
given to him. and also wanted to know if
he was present to give testimony. Presi
dent Newhall turned to Acting Chief
Ittjggy and aske.l him if ..c was ready to
proceed with the trial, and the latter
ivissM-l the "buck" by saying that he had
rI.K-ed the â¢Â¦ntlre matter in the hands of
Â«'.iptain Wittman. The latter cleared
himself by saying that he had not been
notified that the < *se would be heard last
r.ijiht. The trial was. therefore, postponed
A number of applications for permits to
sell linu'T in resorts with back rooms
were heard by the Commissioners, and a
majority were granted on condition that
the proprietors complied with the provi
sions of the new charter. Officer T. J.
Connell who captured i deserter from the
United States army, was permitted to ac
cept Â«Â» reward for his efforts. Connell
turned his runaway soldier over to the
military authorities a few days ago,

lution for his removal. Commissioner
Thomas said that he had no charges.
"My resignation is in the hands of the
Mayor." he said. "I offer that resolution.
If it is r.ot adopted I will go out of that
door and never come back again."
Chairman Thomas' voice and gesture in
dicated as plainly as his words that he
would not play in the Commissioners'
back yard if it did not play his and the
little Mayors way.
Comir.ipsioner Newhall paid he would
Fupport no such resolution. Commissioner
Binary refused to vote or. it and it was left
in the air, a majority oi the board being
necessary to adopt.
Just v.hat followed for a few minutes
afterward is not exactly known beyond
the fact that the Commissioner? were
hnvinp a very warm session. Voices
pitched in a high key floated out into the
erto-rooir.s. where a waiting crowd was

William J. Biggy Produces Documentary Evi
dence to Destroy a Malicious Attack
on His Integrity.
JOSEPH BRITTON
COMMENDS BIGGY
In view of the expressed deter
mination of Mayor Phelan to re
move William J. Biggy from the
Police Commission In order that
the way might be cleared for the
election of Lieutenant Esola as
Chief of Police, The Call sought
an interview last night with Mr.
Joseph Brltton. one of Mr. Fhe
lan's stanchest supporters at the
polls, to gain his views with regard
to the acting Chief. He said:
Do I believe that Mr. Biggy
has pursued the proper course
with regard to Lieutenant
Esola P Certainly. I do not see
how he could have done other
wise.
I wish to be understood as
backing up Mr. Biggy's ac
tion in every respect since he
has been a Commissioner of
Police. He has been true to his
manhood, to his honesty and
to the trust which the public
places in him on account of his
former record as a fearless offi
cial and man of integrity and
honesty generally.
In the matter of Lieutenant
Esola, Mr. Biggy could not
have taken any other course
than the one he pursued, not
only on account of the evi
dence against Esola at the in
vestigation held by the com
mission, but on account of the
man's own testimony. I re
gard Esola's own testimony as
the most damaging to himself
of any heard at that investi
gation.
In view of this testimony
furnished by Esola and his
denial under oath of the meet
ing in reference to his candi
dacy for Chief of Police at
which the Police Commission
ers themselves were present, I
say again that I do not see
how Mr. Biggy could have
pursued any other course
without violating every prin
ciple of honesty and fair play.

that any of these men did the work or
that they had any knowledge of the pre
meditated crime. There has not. so far.
been discovered the slightest direct evi
dence pointing to any man. and it is not
likely now that any will ever be found.
The man who fired the shots took the
precaution to conceal his location by using
smokeless powder cartridges. A score of
people were where they nad a full view
of the side of the building from which the
firing was done and all of them declare
that not a sign of smoke was visible. Both
Chlnn and Killard are men of experience
in affairs in which powder smoke is a
more or less prominent feature and both
declare that while they could tell the gen
eral direction from which the bullets
came, they could not guess the spot from
which they were fired.
"I tried hard to get a sight of the fel
low " said Lillard. ."He kept pouring the
lead down at us, and Til swear there was
not a sign of anything to indicate from
where he was shooting. As many shots as
he fired would make considerable powder
smoke if ordinary cartridges were used,
but never a sign of smoke could 1 see. *
"I looked around a mighty brief *pell,
said Colonel Chirm. "but there was noth
inK for me to look at. so I paid attention
to Goebel. The fellow used smokeless
