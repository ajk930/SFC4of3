was chosen at.' to-night's, session amid
the wildest cheering and the greatest en

penite. effort to . save the colonel and in
line with their rule or ruin tactics, bolted
the caucus after having agreed to abide
by its deliberations. - .- . "
"Ole Bill". McDonald of Alameda shook
off the odium of having associated with
the Burns "push" for a day and returned
to decent coriipany. He was given ; a''re
ception that took all the sting out 'of the
htrsb things his associates had said of
lifm when he temporarily, went astray. ?'
Â¦-The caucus was called to. order at 8
o'clock -by ** Chairman Flint. -The : only
Burns people . present .; were' Shortridge,
Dibble and Johnson, and they refused to
answer to their names when the roll' wai

. No sooner had the roll been called than
Johnson attempted to address- the chair
and was* beautifully called down. : Chair
man Flint stated -that as the Sacramento
Assemblyman -had refused to answer to
his name he would > refuse ; to recognito
him, and Johnson was forced to admit
that the ruling of the chair was correct.
Dibble then announced that he would an
swer to his name if he would be given a
chance to do some talking. It- only re
quired a few - words from him to -show
what a* flimsy subterfuge the Burns peo
ple were advancing as an -excuse for be
coming traitors to their. party and falee
to their promises - to ' the Â¦ caucus. Dibble
made the point of order that there . was
not a quorum - present, ", claiming , that
.Blxty-one,. a majority of all the members,
of both houses of all political â¢Â¦ parties,
were necessarj' to do business. . :
Chairman Flint - ruled â¢ that the caucus
consisted "of the elghty-nve Republican
members, and that v forty-three * was a
quorum. He called attention to the 'fact
that In the call which the . iiurns people
had signed it was specified that forty
three votes would 1 be sufficient^ to riame
the caucus chofce for Senator. The Burns
isaggage then moved itself out of the cau
cus and the balloting was - commenced

to .put . aside personal preferences for the
party's good. , Porty^one members . were
represented, while seven were accounted

R. Bard 'was "advancing. . with; . rapid
strides toward a victory* The ; caucus
then adjourned until to-night, the hour
being fixed at 7:30 o'clock. Early this
morning the .independent : candidates
all recognized . that 'the victory
was surely drifting into the i camp of
Bard. There iwere hurried conferences
and a quick decision. After careful,
consideration it was seen; that Bard
would have. 29 votes, and Irving ] M:.
Scott might count upon 22. It; was a
critical situation for Scott, whpse high-:
est ambition: was to be a .United States
Senator.^ But he -'saw. that*, his ambition
stood in the way of the accomplishment
of the deepest desires of the people of
the State. He sawithat -by remaining
an aspirant he jeopardized thesuccess
of the organized opposition tor. Burns.
So' he withdrew, throwing his; strength
tovÃard. -And in his defeat^lrvlrig M.
Scott has won a splendid triumph. He
has won the . triumph of unselfish pa
triotism, and deserves the commenda
tion and weir wishes of the people; of
California for an act that/has been sel
dom paralleled. .-. / : .
-His unselfishness and; self-sacrifice in
spired '.." the independent Republicans
with an enthusiasm that,. with all their
confidence/ they had not yet: felt. So
when they met. this afternoon they did
so with the firm conviction that the
great battle was riearirik its end arid
that one . of the greatest, triumphs
in the history of California politics was
coon to be registered. At the afternoon
conference,- which forty-one men attend
ed, .it was urianiritously decided to vote
for Thomas. R. -Bard for United States
Senator.'. -. Â¦; .-Â¦.'. .Â¦Â¦Â¦....â¢â¢'â¢ -
, In a twinkling, by a single: vote, order
had come but *of chaos in. the ranks of
the independent Republicans. Conflicts
and antagonisms' had vanished, rival
candidates had- disappeared. â¢ The cause,
arid not the men/ was at stake,. and the
cause won. Thomas R/Bard had only
arrived in . the city. He had neither
sought nor worked for. the superb honor
conferred upon him. He had come at
the calling of. his friends, and within a
few hours after his arrival he knew that
he was to become in a few hours more
the caucus nominee of the Republican
party for United States Senator. Such
a victory had never before been won in
the. history of State politics. ' . .
The news ; . spread everywhere and
flashed into the headquarters of. Burns.
He held a council and decided that even
in defeat he would -not submit. When
the time for the assembly of the caucus
catne his plans were revealed::: He .had
decided to force his . followers tot dis
honor-their caucus pledges, to- remain
away" from. the'eaucusrto" bear'down the
barriers they had; themselves erected to
keep within.- party -lines. His only ex
cuse was that, he had been defeated, and
he would not permit his victors to regis
ter their votes against him. . He an
nounced in his actions that since he had
faced the fear of being an outlaw under
the criminal laws of the State, he did
not scruple against becoming an outlaw
under the rules of a political party. And
in his. desperate game, he determined
that his followers should become polit
ical pirates with him. The caucus was
regularly called by Chairman ; Flint,' pur-
suant to the resqjutiQn of 'adjournment.

Governor Qage. it all came about over

stituting the figures . s23,ooo.
Assembly, bill 15, carrying the appropria
tion for pcr -diem and mileage, was the
measure. under discussion and Brown was
ready to explain his amendment. He an
nounced, that the caucus of last nlglit
demonstrated that the Senatorial fight
was not to last as long as had been'an
ticipated and that he had figured his
amendment from a -thirty rather than a
Blxty-day Â¦ basis. Valentine said. that "he
was glad 'to see that â¢ the . member from
San Mateo had . come to, reason 'and I that
if he would take a couple of hours-earne
st thought he did not doubt uiat hÂ«
would - finally, come down to ' the figures
first offered by the Ways and Means Com
mittee..; Brown, tartly replied that he did
not think so and made way for Dibble,
who got up to represent the Governor. -.-
Dibble shot- off -alt' his customary objec
tions and . wound , up by announcing that
even, at the amended- ngure the -Governor
would veto 1 the â¢ bill.-- Johnson got ; warm
at that and said emphatically that no
member, of- the Assembly' or any other
body could bulldoze him into voting any
other than the- way he wanted." If the
Governor wanted- to veto that bill.: -he
saia,; he would guarantee to find enough
votes- to override the veto. He added
that the Assembly was old enough to de
cide without the" Governor's or Dibble's
assistance how much money It needed
and how; to spehd> It and: proposed to, do
it. , ,The subsequent- vote' demonstrated
that Johnson was right. - .;JÂ§BBW?18BBfiaa8f !

In a "bobtailed" bolters' caucus
held to-night by the adherents of Dan
Burns,; a resolution pledging the
Mexican's crowd never to vote , for
Thomas R. Bard was defeated, hands
down/ In other words, Burns' follow
ers declined to take Burns'. orders and
have reserved to themselves the right
of choice in case they cannot all agree
upon.'; a : compromise - candidate by
Monday next. ;!.,.'/
.- The Burns' caucus showed 'two acquisi
tionsâMbrehouse of : Santa : Clara and
Dickinson of San Francisco. Despite re
peated protestations: by both of the legis
lators named,, they participated in the
Mexican's meeting.- Big Bill McDonald
of Alameda was missing. ' In fact. Mc-
Donald, regretting the mistake he made
in- going over to. Burns last night; for
swore his new master and returned again
to the anti-Burns forces. '
He participated in their â¢ caucus arid
when nis name was called gave his vote
for Thomas R. Bard, with the announce
ment that that was his choice and his
man from that .time on. McDonald's re
turn to the ranks was - greeted - with
cheers that .could have been heard down
stairs,' where the gang he "had forsaken
.was caucusing. 'His fellow -members
crowded round him with assurances of
faith in his intentions and promises to
assist him. In righting the -wrong Impres
sion he made in his off side play to the
Mexican. "TTlrilHiT"* l IIIIL '<J w""ni[fÂ»i
One of 'the first propositions considered
In the Burns meeting was the advisability
of participating In the- regular Republican
caucus In the Assembly chamber. Dibble
and Johnson delivered the Mexican's or
ders. In that matter and stated that in
their opinions the informal meeting held
In the afternoon by the anti-Burns forces
was neither more nor less than a- caucus
to which they had not been Invited. -They
argued that it. relieved them from all
caucus pledges .and that they should of
a consequence have nothing more to do
with the general proposition.- There were
many amonj? the Burns people who dis
agreed with them on that point and' did
not hesitate toÂ» say >so, but the pledeeÂ«
breakers were in â¢ the majority and It was
finally decided that- a committee consist-
Ing of. Dibble, Shortrldge and ' Johnson,
should call upon the anti-Burns stalwarts
and announce that 'they would take no
part in the proceedings. .
. A. : resolution pledging the Burns : people
to never cast a vote for Thomas R. Bard
was strongly backed by Dibble and John
son,, but it was a straw too much for. the
gang and they defeated it by a* vote that
was little short of unanimous/ -It r was
finally decided to see if : ay compromise
could: not be effected and anothftr caucus
will be held on Monday at 2 o'clock p. m
to determine what has been accomplished
along that line. - >
the wildest Joy followed.. Members of the
caucus . rushed .from their- seats .to-.con
gratulatei him and amid- the tumult he was
given .three cheers and a tiger. :. . '.

son than to show that the man
who owns them possesses them
co securely that they will crawl
in the mire of their own disgrace
to obey him.
Thomas R. Bard, with fifty
out of eighty-five votes, is the
caucus nominee of the Republi
can party. And the -man' who
took his benefactor down into
the black depths of a mine and
with ugly leer commanded him
to do as* he was told or go down
to death in the shaft is now tell
ing the people of California that
nnless they raise him, crime
stained," to the United States
Senate they cannot have repre
sentation; He is telling the peo
ple of California that, discredit
ed, repudiated, repulsed in dis
gust as he is, he has still the out
la w^s power to keep them from
what is their; own; Admitting
his own humiliating defeat,
knowing that nothing, not even
'.-the money of the Southern Pa
cific Company, nor the ' pa
tronage of Governor Gage, who
is the purchased thing of the
Southern Pacific Company, nor
the prostituting influences of po
litical harlots; can- change that
defeat into victory, he raises
himself on his pedestal of thiev
ing deeds, dishonored trusts,
private robberies and public out
rages, and declares that since the
people of California have dared
to throw him out as a thing rer i
pulsive and unclean; they can
have no other man to represent
them in th^ councils of the na

had the assistance of paid corruptionists

Jiad the gigantic influences of the
Southern Pacific Company at his beck

craft of the social and political scum,

his lash of patronage, and what has he

asked why the Irish militiamen were sent

"Because. they are rebels."
This caused John Dillon, Irish National

BOERS' BIGGEST ARMY
MUST BE CRUSHED
i LONDON. Feb. 3.â Spencer Wilkinson.
who devotes his article in the Morning
Post to-day to the principles upon which
war should be conducted as applicable to
South Africa, says: .; ..
"The lifers have no great cities. Pre
toria and Blo\ ! mfontein are not centers of
national life, like Paris and London. To
occupy them, therefore, would have little
effect, unless after the defeat of the Boer
army. The Boer power Is the body: of
citizens constituting the army. It is
therefore our first business to crush the
biggest armyâ namely, that in the vicin
ity of Ladysmith. Though there have
been apparently troops enough in South
Africa, General Buller has never had suf
ficient number for this purpose. Accord
ingly the outline of the war reveals no
bold and clear conception. Until the
strategical idea emerges and controls the
whole operation there can be no decided
turn in the tide." / . ?..;.

not familiar. A decision was reached "at
once, and when Senator-elect Blackburn
with Representatives Allen, Hoyt, Gil
bert, Smith and Wheeler called this morn
ing to protest against Federal Interfer
ence In Kentucky the President promptly
gave them to understand that he had al
ready reached a conclusion on the sub
ject and that he had found- that the situa
tion did not warrant the Federal authori
ties In interfering.
This decision was announced to the
Cabinet immediately upon its convening.
Attorney General Griggs, Secretary Root
and other lawyers of the Cabinet bus-
tamed the President's conclusion. The
law which must govern in this case au
thorizes Federal action only when the
Legislature is not in session and cannot
be convened.' Governor Taylor's message
does not intimate that the Legislature of
the State cannot be promptly convened
nor does he show that the conditions in
Frankfort are such as would justify Fed
eral intervention.
The President and the members of his
Cabinet without exception recognize the
fact that the Legislature of the State of
Kentucky by a majority thereof is the
solo judgo of which of the two contestants
was elected Governor of the State at the
recent election.
GOEBEL'S CONDITION
CONTINUES TO IMPROVE
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 3.â At 12:30 a.
tn. Goebel was as comfortable as he had
been at any time during the day. He was
able to take a little nourishment at mid

The Indications are for a good night..
In fact. Mr. Goebel's condKlon' ls con

â¢ .enthusiastic stumper * for John â¢
?: Young : Brown for Governor. He â¢
?, was a prominent lawyer and Dem
?_-;.'ocratic politician, and had- made j
â¢i many enemies, among the moun- -
?; talneers in defending cases, for the -
?coal companies. There were five -
- Bhots fired, and two took effect. He- â¢
- waa shot with a Winchester of the -
-same caliber, as that- used by the â¢
-' would-be assassin of Goebel. - -
ing yesterday, which Increased his
strength perceptibly, and though unfa*
vorable symptoms showed themselves at
times the sick man always rallied well.
Compared with twenty-four hours ago
his condition shows a decided improve
ment, his temperature being nearly nor
mal, though some of the fever still shows
itself. ...
His pulse and respiration are still high,
but his kidneys; the condition of which
had been regarded as the most unfavor
able symptom, are performing their func
tions in a more normal manner," thus ob
viating in a degree the danger of uraemlc
poisoning. Goebel during yesterday com
plained somewhat of bedsoreness, and he
was. turned partly on his side to relieve
the strained muscles. This for a time had
an unfavorable effect, but he soon rallied
and shortly afterward fell Into a slight
sleep. His temperature at 10 o"clock last
night was 100 V4, his respiration 33 and his
pulse 120. Should the wounded man un
dergo no change for the worse before doy
llght his physicians express the hope that
his recovery, though necessarily slow, will
be sure.
"At present Governor 'Goebel breathes
altogether from his left lung," said Dr.
Williams at midnight. "Clotted blood has
almost closed his wounded right lung,
which, of course, forms a natural bandage
and prevents further bleeding, but later
will prove somewhat a source of danger.
The clotted blood will decompose in about
eight days, and then it may be necessary
to remove a section of a rib to remove
the decomposed blood. The wound will
then be drained and the danger will then
be from secondary hemorrhage."

SHERIFF SUTTON
MAY BE IMPLICATED
LOUISVILLE, Feb. 2.â A warrant for
the arrest of James L. Sutton, the Wbit
ley County Sheriff, charging him Â¦with ma
licious shooting with intent to kill, reached
here to-night from Frankfort. Sutton at
tracted attention Wednesday night by his
spectacular leap from the third-story win
dow of the Victoria Hotel in an attempt
to escape arrest. He is thought by the
Frankfort authorities to have either been
implicated in the attempted assasslnat'on
of Governor Goebel or to have important
information as to the identity of the real
culprits. Sutton has acted queerly since
his arrest Wednesday, and many people
here believe him to be mentally unbal
anced. Sutton will probably be taken to
Frankfort to-morrow.

Campbell Accused of
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â The defense
in the case of Senator Clark of Montana,
before the Senate. Committee on Privi
leges and Elections, to-day began the
presentation of its side of the contro
versy. The first half of the day was
given to three witnesses for the memo
rialists, after which Thomas T. Lyons,
County Attorney of Jefferson County, was
called to the stand by Faulkner In
Clark'a behalf.
His testimony was rather Btartllng in
several -respects. He brought Repre
sentative Campbell, one of the attorneys
for the prosecution, into the controversy
as an active participant in the case, say
ing that Campbell had .promised him
$5000 to testify against Clark. He had
previously been a worker for Clark, and
said that he acted in this matter at -the'
instance of C. W. Clark, playing â¢ the
part, as the witness put it, "of a White
side on the other side."
â¢ Accordingly, he said, he had visited
Campbell. After hearing- his proposition
to testify that several members of.- the
Legislature, had been to " his. knowledge
bribed, Campbell had agreed to pay him
the sum -mentioned for the evidence t aN"

that afterward .-Campbell had told' him

: This Democrats claim that the action of
the Republicans in arresting Walker
while he was attempting to carry out the
orders of the court has placed them in
cotjtompt of court and they will make all
of the point that is possible.
Â¦ The Democratic members of tho-Legls
laiure to-day effected a regular organiza
tion for the first time since the swearing
in of Governor Goebel. A secret session
of the members of both houses was held In
one of the parlors of the Capitol Hotel, at
I which the election of Goebel as Governor
I and Beckham as Lieutenant Governor
was reatllrmed. first in separate sessions
of the House and Senate and afterward
in joint session. Preceding this action,
the members of the Senate elected as
president pro tern. Senator Carter, who
was nominated for that position at yes
terday's caucus. A committee of the
members of the House, composed of Rep
resentatives Finn, Lafferty and Cochran.
was also appointed to draw up a set of
resolutions showing the condition of af
fairs as it exists at the State Capitol to
day and covering thoroughly the Demo
cratic side of the controversy. These res
olutions will be formally presented to the
next session of the Democratic members
of the Legislature, to be held Monday.
The session, which lasted for nearly two
hours, was kept as secret as possible for
fear of possible interference. Xo further
sessions Â¦ will y be held until Monday, ad
journment belnc: taken until that time,
and probably no further attempt will be
made to hold sessions in the State House.
Af t*r ratifying their former action in re
gard to the Governorship and Lieutenant
Governorship considerable discussion took
place as to. the. plan of action to be taken
â¢liv regard to: the session of the Legislature
railed by Governor Taylor at London next
Tuesday. -Though none of those who at
tended the caiicui cared to discuss the
matter, it seemed :to be well, understood
among the Democratic members of the
Legislature that the session at. London
will &c. ignored altogether by- them and
Uhat no; Democrat: wilt attend "Unless

.â¢House ..-.by the Democratic members in a
body, -who will, however, continue to hold
sessions '.-a.t-.some convenient place until
the- political atmosphere has clearsd.
This pjan .; of action was decided on to
forestall. any attempt on the part of the
Renublieans to arrest them and compel
their attendance at London, which action

be avoided, and that the battle for su
premacy, hereafter should be fought out
in the courts. Nevertheless, the situa
tion to-night is regarded as a grave one
by members of both parties, and no one
is willing to forecast the result of the
anticipated clash of authority between
Governor Taylor and the State courts.
Some action is expected at the session
on Monday. -In regard to offering a re
ward of R30.000 for the arrest and convic

and the Preserves.
The shooting season, which will enrl with
this month, is slowing down gradually,
the number of shooters in the field dimin
ishing from week to week. During the
past fortnight the weather conditions hay*
beer* unfavorable for duck shooting, and
the majority of the men who have visited
the preserves of the various gun clubs
have had but small returns for their ef
forts. Weather conditions remain xn
changed, and unless a storm blows up
shortly the cream of the shooting for this
season' has been skimmed. Mallards are
reported to be coming In from the south,
and should afford some shooting for the
remainder of the season.
Some prominent sportsmen favor a
shorter season in view of the fact that
the first month or so provides little sport.
The northern birds, which afford the beat
of the sport, do not come down until win
ter weather sets in in earnest. It la doubt
ful if any concerted action will be taken
in the matter.
Tod Sloan has spent the major portion
of his time afield since he came to thl3
coast. He has been the guest of many
prominent sportsmen and as such has shot
over the principal preserves. In company
with Georsre. and Andrew Jackson and
Walter D. Mansfield he is shootin? to-day
as the guest of C. C. Mansfield at the
Santa Rosa drawbridge. The sport Las
been excellent there recently and the gen
tlemen expect good returns to-day.
The vicinity of Mount Eden provided the
best shootlnfj down the bay last Sunday.
The McDonald brothers secured a joint
bag of fifty birds at that point.
Cranston. Carison, Ostrander, Dr. P. J.
Lane and others of the Pastime Club se
cured small reiurns at their Alvarado
grounds.
L. R. Larzalere and J. H. Burfeind r^cre
en the preserve of the Spooney Gun Club,
near Alvarado, last Sunday, but had no
shooting. They sat in their "blinds" all
day but there was no flight of birds. Phil
Bekeart of the club has invited Dr. K. N.
Short, the all-around sportsman, to ssharÂ«>
the shcoting with him to-morrow.
Bert Patrick, with Hugh Boyle of Mil!
Valley, have planned an expedition among
the canvasbaoks in Richardsons Ba;- for
to-morrow. Thfy will go from Sausallto
in a launch arÂ»<i expect some rare shoot
ing, although the birds are not edible, a3
they have lived on fish for some time.
Dr. A. M. Barker, the shotgun enthusiast
of San Jose, haf been enjoying excellent
sport on a small pond in the hills near
Mount Hamilton. La3t Sunday he secured
thirty-two "cans." while on the previous
Sunday he killed thirty-one. Dr. Barker,
as representative of the Garden City Gun
Club, is anxious for and will probably a:
ran Re a tournament at inanimate tarfTflt*.
to be held in San JosÂ©, about the thlra
Sunday in March.
Fred Feudner was "hfgh gun" on Â»Ti*
Olympic Gun Club's Cordelia preserv* last
Sunday, securing 2S birds. L.. W. Harp
ham bagged 20. Dr. A: T. Derby 16. Will
iam Bay 15 W. A. Marshall U and H. L.
Miller 6. The weather was fogpy; an-J
other conditions were against good snort.
F, G. Sahborn. Frank P. McLennan and
At Wilson mavfe another pilgrimage on
Thursday to Tomales . Bay In quest of
black brant. Their, previous trip proved
a failure owing, as they believe, to thÂ«
fact that it was full moon, which Inter
fered with the flight of the birds.
Sol Sharp and F. P. McLennan wera
among the jrunmen- in the field near Al
varado last Sunday. â¢
Dr. F J. Lane secured a dozen ducks
at Willow Lodge preserve. Alvarado. last
Sunday.. The water was high, otherwise
better sport would have resulted.
The directors of the Olympic Gun Club
expect to turn the control of their trap
shooting grounds- at Ingleside over to a
new association within a week. This as
sociation will be a neutral one and will
prohably be composed of representative?
of different gun clubs, which will promote
trap-shooting on the jrrounds this season.
The- Olympics will maintain their down
town clubhouse and the extensive pre
serves at Cordelia, over which the mem
bers, shot this seasbn.

The programme cbmmittee, after Cbnsld
.eratlon of the importance, of their de*

upon them, decided to recomiiriend to the
bund- that a sum of.' money not less. thaxi
$10.(XX) be appropriated for the cash prizes
alone:. This does not 'take into-consider

POST-MORTEM ACTION.
LENDER the Confucian system, which : is the
j philosophy 6t China, it is the practice to reward
a living man for some .worthy act, useful to the
state or beneficial to the people, bj" climbing his an
cestral iree and conferring a patent of nobility, or a
jubstanfial ascription of praise* upon some very re
mote 'progenitor . dead spiorig that he mun have ; a
proxy to represent him in the ceremonial reception
of the post-mortem honor. . It is the habit ol the
Western nation? to be funny about this at the expense
of the Climcse. In the Occident the system is cx-
EctJy t-he reverse. The honors, bestowed upon Drake,
Mariborotgh, the .rounder of the Howards, and
ethers in England, descend to their progeny, and
carrj- with them landed estates, title?, pensions,'bene
fices and privileges, to bÂ« enjoyed and exercised fre-
Quexxuj -by person's, in ' themselves; entirely worthless
and incapable of making any return to the; state;
which is unjustly bardencd in paj-ing them . for. deecls
done by their ancestors. The Chinese sj'stem is far
preierable. :It '."ork? backward and works inexpen-
<ivety. It is npgn the" sound principle of rewardins
thÂ« memory of an ancestor whose physical and Tnoral
prepotency has . subsisted through generations, an<l
prbdaced a man contpicuoudy u?eful to his Ktate atrd
race. It casif nothing except for tlic regalia, rituiil
tnd ceremony.. If it were applied in England vast
estates wpnld be released from the grasp oi the dead

In the United "-State* the decire ; has: appeared to do
sotsething in the post-raortem way. Two hundred
and sixty-five ;:. years ago : /Massachusetts'.'' banished
Roger WilHams. Roger had not stolen horses, nor
tippled, nor acted disorderlj-. He was guilty of hold
ing religious views;^at.. yariane'e with those of the
Puritans. Anything but that would be forgiven. But
for that alone Roger, was regarded as the bad. man
nf the colony. The Puritans had raced half around
the: globe in search of liberty of conscience for them
Â«;e!ves and the power to deny it to even-body else.
Tliercforc Williams was insufferable, and he was cx
con".iTiunicated and cart ' into outer darkness Â¦ spirit
i:r.l!y. But the Puritans did riot consider that a suf
ficient punishment. The 3' could shut him out of
beaven. but they thought thnt was light. punishment
compared to fhuttmg him put of .Massachusetts. Â¦ He
niglit endure deprivation of 'the "society of the.angeh
ar.d sairits But how was lie to stand exclusion from
tl-.e society of the Puritans? Therefore they put iipon
h'Tti the he?.\-} f penalty of- banishment, and sent him.
overthc colony line to perish. Boger patiently
: fr>'Jtcd it down the c6aÂ«=t, found a pleasant place.
I'i'ched there his tent.; and devtjutly called it "Proyi
ae-icc." a city which endures unto. this day and cm
he seen from any part of. the State of Rhode Island.
After nearly three hundred years Massachusetts Wants
Roper to come back, so there is now pending in tbc
Legislature at Boston a bill for an act. to revoke the
*-enter.cc of banishment; It should pass. Two and
tvo-thirds centuries is a long: time to find out-a*mis
take, but it costs little to correct it. With these post
mortem issues foremost jn England and America, let
us take by the hand our Celestial brother of far

not left outside of the. system, to : bear its burdeni
and get none of its benefit?. That is the exact effect
of Mr. Kasson's policy. ' :Inhis treaties '.'he. sacrifices,
without merer, the interests of the farmer, prchardtst
and : 'Vitjeyar.dis't to. add to the profits of the manufac : i
turer. The effect is to compel the farmer to sell In
a free trade market and buy in a protected market.
He must produce oranges, fruit; wjne and brandy in.
competition; with the islands. arid France, and sell at
the price: of their lower labor; bÂ«t he must : buy jn a
market protected against competition and.' at- tH-e

There has. been a: tendency of. course to find a scape

s'pi'i rapidly ever since-- the wa.r 'openedy but there- is a

a military:, force' adequate' to its heeds.. '.-. \ â¢.â¢"Â¦'

â¢ . Great; Britain is rich enough- to support' as. large an
army as any nation dh. the. globe, and her population
is .sufficiently numerous to j furnish the men," but for.
all that the task of. increasing the army: is notgoinj
to be easily performed. In the. first place) the British
people have- long prided' themselves on being a' nortr
military nation. They have looked upon conscrip
tion as characteristic .of the military powers of-Conti
.nentai' Europe, and regarded it as something alien to
British .liberty, and yet .it-s eems it' will have to be
resorted to if the : army is to . be' largely increased;
Thus the first step 'toward augmenting the : military
force of the empire will, have to be taken by trampling
upon one of the most venerated' traditions of .the
people. .Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦'.'.. Â¦, ;.Â¦'';Â¦Â¦' '. .-'..'â¢ " '. â¢
â¢ That the^.probapility of a military conscription con
fronts them is well understood by the. .more .intcHi
gent" among the people, and the leading papers are
how discussing it as : a matter of practical politics.
The Westminster Gazette presents the situation thus:
"Â¦\\'c have to .take, fact,? as we. -"find. - them the first fact,
being; that we are involved in a military operation six.
Â¦thousand miles away which strains all the
of the empire; the â¢ -next fact, which lieÂ§ just ahead.

THE^ SXX: FRAXCISCCK CALIi, v SATURDAY, Â¦ FEBRUARY
MERCHANTS SEE
DANGER TO THE
VALLEY TRADE
Will Protest .V ; A gai nst
: ; i v ; New Tariff, t
One& more the merchants- of San Fran
cisco are compelled to taKe steps to pro
tect their trade territory. .â¢ A tariff has
beerrissued by the. Southern Facinc Com-
pany; lit which. the Santa. Fe unites, giv
ing "I*oB Anselea : an kdyantafe; Over San
Franeteco -in .freight Â¦Â¦Â¦'io\ BakersfleM.
amounting tr> 13 cent? pef 10<) ;. : pounds : on
fourth class and 1^ cerifs pn first class, or
J3 c) per ton on the higher class* freights.
When the merchants saw <he tariff yes
terday: there *ras great indignation. This
may lead to a meeting of the.-m erchants.
for the effect Of the tartfl Is to drawr the
line within which San Francisco will be
able to meet l^os Angeles, pn even terms
as far north as Delano; : ..'Â¦ ...""". .
Â¦ The * general ; Impression Is abroad, here
that the railroad people are .". throwing a
sop to Los Angeles at the expense of
San Francisco to offset the trouble that
they are. having with the citrus fruit
shippers of the south in \the matter or
routing. This opinion waa : freely ex
pressed :In the wholesale section yester
day. The first move that will be made
will foe a conference with- the official* of.
both the Southern Pacific and the Santa
Fe. This might have taken place yes
terdar. but- Mr. Blsgell is out of town.
The purpose Is -to have the conference
before the tariff goes into effect, which
will be In a few: days. , .: :
Unless the desire to give Los Angeles
something as a solace for : the hostile
measures adopted concerning the cit
rus fruit growers Is the .-: reason for the
measure of discrimination against this
city,- It Is difficult to -find-one baaed hi
equity. ':Â¦'Â¦ It is true that the mileage from
Los Angeles to- Bakersfleld is less than
from . San Francisco to Bakersfleld, but
the merchants say that topography is al
ways an element of rate-makin?, and the
road from Los Angeles to Bakersneld
runs . over mountains and largely through
a barren country, while the route through
the San Joaquln Valley is almost level.
and It passes through a fruitful country
that provides a, large volume of freight.
Once before the same fight for -trade In
Bakersfleld took place and San Fran
clsco was victorious. Then It was sup
posed '. that the .matter was settled for
good. The tarifT making so heavy a dif
ferential will, not' so into effect without
a. vigorous. protest. -.-.â¢.- â¢ . â¢â¢;Â¦-,; Â¦-,-

themselves is legitimate for use in a kin
dergarten occupation. : ; . Leaf garlands are

Is hot a preparatory course in dressmak
ing or tailoring, nor is its drawing, mod
eling and coloring to make artists fully
equipped for life..- "to make visible the
invisible spirit of man" is, according to
Froebel, the function of art. To foster
the spirit of art, which seeks, to find
what it may work at.. Is his purpose in
his direction of childish activities, for
"even a child is known by. his dolne."
-Education is only -'a, process of unfold
ing. .All that can be done from without
Is to supply right conditions. To under
stand these conditions and to meet them
Is the effort of the child gardener. He
needs to know not only the particular
game, -story, gift or occupation, but the
nature and needs of the growing child
plant. The gardener must know* his gar
den, lie may 'scatter eeed and till and
water. The plant must grow. The true
kindergarten is the garden so cultivated.

Some of the kindergarten games repra

the movements of ffreat natural forces, as
water and wind, and the growth of plant
life, are used in primary grades to great
advantage, and serve as a stimulus to thÂ«
more exact observation of. what J9 repre
sented. Through imitation-one appropriates
the life. of the thing*, and sympathy is
born of a fuller understanding. To My and

â¢In Mrs. Wiggin'B stoo* of Patsy, the
street waif who strays into the kinder
garten thinks himself 1n . heaven, -with
bird songs filling the air. the windows full
Of bloom and a loving, sunny woman to
mother a flock -of children. Such a
heaven is not now the exclusive province
of the klftdergartner.- There is no sudden
change of climate when one enter 3 a. pri
mary room; 'Here.-. : too,- are-warmth and
sunshine, blooming geraniums and sing
ing birds. In one window we: may see a.
garden planted with peas or beans, that
little eyes may behold the ever-new mlr
acle: of. germination and jrrowth. in an
other window the. egg-shell garden makes
It pQSStUIe fpr any child to know and
car* for his own- plant. Jack and Jill
and alt the other names are plainly writ
ten on the half shells, that each child
may gain the sensÂ© of responsibility and
feeling of affection for the growing thing
that '. comes ="Â¦ from ownership- Another
window: oosslbly rejoices in an aquarium,
and at the right season some other bro
ther Is sure to bring a Jar of poiiywogÂ».
Then there is the joy of. watching day
after day for the different phases of the
wondrous change. A visit from a rabbit,
fl squirrel, p. kitten or from mother hen
and her chicks Is hot at all a surprising
event in the modern schoolroom, in a
few places such pets are . kept and sent
from one school miiidinÃ to another.

Rhymes or Poems.
Khymes and simple poems are valuable
auxiliaries to this nature work and serve
also to make the- beginnings of literature.
The poet often gives a tongue to what
the youns child feels. The chilrl heart
everywhere rejoices In the time when

Language.
The repetition of such rhymes and
memory gems helps very much inthe lan
guage work of tn.Â» school. The child's
vocabulary is enriched- thereby and right

Reading.
'. The best preparation ior reading is not
to dull the interest and contract it* prov
ince by. confining the child's attention to
dead symbols of" Ideas, but rather to
quicken and direct tHa natural desire to
hear and to know about things which
shall . create : the need of Â¦ supplementing
one's own slender stock of information by
ail that books can- offer. .Recognition of.
words and letters constitutes the mechan
lsm:of readlns, and, like any other me*
chanical process, la only a means to an
end. ' Heading is a process of Interpreta
tion, and as we see with all we have seen
and know with all we have known, so wo
muat Interpret ideas with all that we have
in mind. ; The first:- years of school life,
then, should be largely devoted to gain
ing the' basis of experience which gives
the power of understanding and Inter
preting, ideas. â¢ Out of ihe richness or the
child's experience Is born the desire to
relate, to share what one has enjoyed,
and with. the constant practice of telling
what one' has seen or heard by oral ana
written exercises grows mastery of lan

Hand Work.
. But. there Ia: a language of thÂ» band
which may not be omitted in our efforts
to endow the human being with full pow
ers of utterance. Music. drawing, model
ing,- color work, outlining with thread or
worsted,- cutting. and folding- are not to
be classed as "fads": or "frUls.v but aÂ»
essential means of education. The child
must learn to speak "a various language"

Number Work.
In connection with these various forms
of hand work we discover the -most natu
rat methods of number work. The best
authorities agree that the rlrst two- years
of school life should be kept free from
drill In number. Much effort is' now
wasted in . attempting : to . teach prema
turely what can be easily acquired at a
period when the reasoning faculty ia more
fully developed. In. Ins. "Education of
Man" Froebel points out: the- connection
between" drawing' and- number. How
many legs : for a chair, â¢ a table? How
many arms for a man?- How many cher
ries, in this bunch? And/so on. In folding
and. cutting the "relation, of . parts to *.
whole is a matter of practical demonstra
tion; Â¦ "Music." writes the wise Comeniua,
"is especially natural to Us. for ail soon
as we see:the- light we Immediately sine
the song. of paradise." and he adds fer
vently, "Blessed Is the home where voiceÂ»
resound In music". No:, less blessed is tho
school where harmony, grace and rhythm
are â¢ cultivated-:: through.- the agency of
song... Â¦ ; Â¦'; -. '.-' . Â¦. .- ';,- ' - .
..And there . Is no more complete sum

school years : ihan the statement of this

i The evidence, of Joseph Reedy, the prln*

complete surprise. He tcstlrled that Joyce
i llred two shots at Dillon before Dillon

the supposition that Dillon acted In. eelf

I after Joyce and DHion '-had pome words
Joyce remarked that he was going to thei
i toKet roorrtj and when he : returned he
I pulled a revolver out of hjs pocket, and
I taking hold of Dillon told'him to get out,
as he did not want either his trade or his
presence. \ Dillon remailied, ''That's an
assault with a deadly weapon.: and I'll
have you fixed for it." Joyce said, "You
I drew, a gun on me once before^ but if you
: draw & gun on me. this time I'll; fill you
full of holes." Joyce pointed the revolver

at Joyce, who Iducked, behind the bar:

to ? the conclusion that the foreign flnancjal
and political complications are to play a. de
cided part In shaping the action of speculation
on this. 3ide of the ocean. -More attention has

previous contracts have' been larger than a.
year ago. The '.work turned but the past month
probably surpasses all others and rightly con
sidered the fact, that new contracts for works
already -well supplied are smaller, than last
ypar Is not of Itself discouraging. : The great
burst Â¦of speculation last year swelled Janu
ary payments through clearing-houses far-be-;
yond those of thl3 year- at New York and such
payments at Â¦ pther. <540) . cities also averaged
per business day a, shade larger -than this

Not a Decadent Race.
"The Decadence of Nations" waa tho
subject of a lecture delivered last night
at the Temple Emanu-El. The speaker
took the broad view that as every nation
had a beginning It must also have an end.
This Is proved by the fact that the na
tions of antiquity have all passed away
and tho nations of to-day are all of com
paratively modern origin, particularly the
greatest two. the Anglo-Saxon and the
Teutonic All of the^, old nations decayed,
said the speaker, because of the corrup
tion of their political instltutl6ns. He con
tended that there is grave danger of the
great nations of to-day falling "into the
same degrading conditions. Judged by
these standards, the American nation is
not as yet a decadent nation, although the
modern tendency to crowd Into the cities
and to overstrain the sustaining. power of
the soil In the small spaces under cultiva
tion Is having a very degrading effect. '

LARGE NUMBER
OF WELLS WILL
BE NECESSARY
Report on Water Sup
ply for the City.
Oakland Office San Francisco â¢ Call,
. .903 Broadway, Feb. 2,
City Engineer Clement says at least a
hundred- and ten wells would be. needed
at Roberts Landing to supply, water for
the. City of Oakland. This estimate Is
based upon a requirement of 11.000,000 gal
lons of water every twenty-four hours,
and an average daily production from
each well of 100,000 gallons:
In the recent unsatisfactory test made
It was ascertained that one well-had a ca
pacity of 163,000 gallons per day, while
another spouted 103,628 gallons. This 'was
done' under an Insufficient pressure and
other adverse circumstances.
To bore new wells to determine abso
lutely the depth of the water, stratum and
the geological formation of the lands
would cost about $1000 each. Whether
such a large number of wells contiguous
to each other would affect the flow In the
aggregate is a question which the City
Engineer does not undertake to deter
mine. 'Â¦ -V'V
The two wells from which the most
water was produced at the recent test
were down to a depth of 506 and 300 feet
respectively, and they pierce the same
sand stratum.
The report was submitted to the Board
of Public Works, and will be sent to the
Council next Monday night.

EROICA SYMPHONY
AND HENRY HOLMES
THE symphony concert of Thursday
afternoon waÃ something of a suc
cess. Henry Holmes, the conductor,
is a failure. He Is so variously lack
ing that there is nothing left to do but
to state his deficiencies. As a conductor
he has proved not only inefficient, but a
positive obstacle to the worthy efforts of
an excellent orchestra. The musicians un
der him are the best that we have, and
despite the absence of a few of the most
valuable players that are available, con
stitute, the best band that has ever been
gathered together in San Francisco: If
they do not succeed in orchestrizlng to the
best advantage It Is not the fault of the
individual players but of their leader; who
with the. superb force under his control
fail* to give us anything like good music.
:Mr. Holmes may have ability as a tech
nician, but his dry Btyje. his unconscious
ness of rhythm and his utter lack of indi
vidualism does not give to his readings
an lntcreÂ»t that calls for enthusiastic
commendation. â¢
Beethoven's third symphony ("Err-tca'^
was the important item â¢of yesterday's
concert, but its: rendering was so blunt
and ineffective that the composition lost
Its value to all who were familiar with Its
potency and possibilities. Such Inapiness,
such want of spirit, such distortion of
rhythm and fluency, and. above all, such
a lack of color and distinction could not
tut rob this composition, to which Beeth
oven brought not only his higher poetic
sensibilities but also a positively immense
human passion,, of its interest, and, I
might almost say, of Its musical value.
The sound of strings, and reeds and
brass cease to be music when they fall to
compass the full purpose of a composition,
and there can be no doubt of their inef
ficiency at yesterday's concert. The rcad
inir of the scherzo of the "Eroica" was
particularly shameful.
In the Schubert unfinished symphony
Mr. Holmes, with the aid of his very capa
ble orchestra., redeemed himself in a meas
ure. The tender melody of the first
movement was agreeably given In good
tempo and with admirable expression. The
delicious -modulations of Schubert's ad
mlrablbt.l might almost say beat, compo
sition could not be made valueless oven
by the most Insensitive conductor. In the
Tschaikowsky "Homeo and Juliet" over
ture Mr, Holmes contrived to put some
breadth and vigor, particularly In the cen
tral melody. The composition is of on
essentially modern character, and con
trasted sharply with the overture of
Cherublnl'B opera, "Los Abencerrage^,"
with which the programme began.- The
Tschaikowsky number has a carrying
power of its own and to a great degree
plays Itself. Mr. Holmes, however, was
not up to the spirit of It throughout, anj
at times abridged Its Interest by his temp
eramental Bho%* RGARVE _,

Lillie Reichsrath Gets a Divorce.
OAKLAND, Feb. 2.â Superior Judge Hal
has granted Lillie Reichsrath a divorce
from Fred Reichsrath on the gTOund of
cruelty. The wife claimed that one night
her husband drove her from her homo fa
Alameda at the point of a revolver and
when she was clad only In her nightgown.
Some of the testimony proved interesting
Mrs. R. M. Caswell. the plaintiff's mother,
testified that she once warned Reichsrath
not to strike a woman; "that if he dar"<i
to strike me I would put him where the
dogs could not bite him." Defendant Is
ordered to pay 15 a month toward the
support of the minor child.
Want Railroad Extension.
Imbued with the success attending the
extension of the Twenty-fourth street
trolley line to Rhode Island street, the
Nuevo Potrero Improvement Club,
through its attorney. C. F. Klmball, will
seek further extension for the benefit of
the hundreds of laboring men who are
employed in the Union Iron Works, sugar
refinery and other branchÂ«s of industry
on the south shore of the bay. The club
will petition for a cross line direct over
the Potrero hills on the line of Twenty
fourth street to Kentucky. As It now Is
they have to go the roundabout way of
Bryant street to Sixteenth and then
around the sloping hillside to Kentucky
street. In addition to this a further ac
commodation will be asked on the Twen
ty-fourth street line to Mission street in
stead of the present way into the business
portion of trie city by Folsom street,
where transfers must be had to either
Eighth or fourth streets.
Injured During Her Sleep.
OAKLAND. Feb. 2.â Mrs. Elizabeth
Bowman, aged 55 years, residing at 415
Second street, received an Injury In a
most peculiar manner this morning that
almost cost her the sight of her right eye.
While Mrs. Bowman was fast asleep a
small piece of plastering dropped from
the celling of her room and fell on her
right eyelid. She awoke immediately and
as she opened her eyes the particle of
plastering slipped between the eyelids
and burned the eyeball quite severely.
She hurried to the Receiving Hospital,
where Steward Borchert applied a sooth
ing wash and by prompt attention relieved
the woman's pain and saved her eye.

ANARCHIST AVOIDS
SERVICE ON JURY
BERKELEY, Feb. 2.â F. A. Parsons, a
carpenter, has successfully solved the
problem of avoiding jury service. He was
subpenaed in Justice Edgar's court this
morning to serve as a Juror In the case
of the People vs. Thomas G.jGibney.
charged with malicious mischief. As
usual the Justice administered the oath
as to the ability of the prospective juror
to serve In the case, ending with the fa
miliar exhortation. "So help you God.
"AH but the 'God,' " answered Parsons
with emphasis. '

DRUNKEN DRIVER NEARLY
KILLS A SMALL BOY
OAKLAND, Feb. 2.â Pedestrians on
Fourteenth street were horror-struck
this evening to see a frenzied
horse galloping along the street with
a small boy apparently Impaled upon one
of the shafts of the buggy to which the
animal was- attached. The boy was
dragged along over a hundred feet before
the horse could be stopped, and an ex
cited mob vociferously demanded that W.
C. Thompson, the driver, be lynched.
Everybody expected to find the lad dead
when he was released from his frightful
predicament, but his escape had been mi
raculous and he was all right, beyond a
few slight bruises and a badly torn coal.
Thompson, who is a nurseryman, was
drunk and was lashing his horse to the
top of his speed along the street. The
boy, who lives at 727 Twenty-sixth street,
was riding east on a bicycle when he was
run down by the maddened animal. The
shaft penetrated his coat and Just grazed
his skin on the left side.
Thompson was booked on a charge of
fast driving.
DEATH OF AN AGED
PIONEER PREACHER
OAKLAND, Feb. 2.â Rev. T. S. Burnett,
ono of the pioneer preachers of Califor

his daughter. Mrs. Christabel Stewart, at
415 San Pablo avenue. He was 77 years

NEW QUARTERS
FOR WOMAN'S
EXCHANGE
Large and Handsome
Rooms.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.- . 908 Broadway, Feb. 2. â¢
The Woman's Exchange, of Oakland
moved to-day from : Its 'former place of
business on. Broadway to : a . very- bright
and pretty location on Franklin and Thir
teenth streets. The cause: of the change
was the cramped quarters just vacatel.
The new. headquarters 6t the exchange
4s i block from where It was formerly.
Jn every way this charity. Is prospering
just now. Mrs. Phcbo Hearst has lately
remembered It with a cash gift and others
'have made contributions of flowers and
similar necessaries for a dainty lunch
room. Among the most generous gifts,
too, have been those of time and trouble.
Half a dozen ladles have been actively
engaged for the past three days In re
placing the art work at the new establish
ment and superintending other changes,
and to-night the effect was such as to
amply repay their toil. . â¢*: .
The large corner room, that combines
sales counters and' tea room, has glass
windows on two entire sides, giving an
abundance of sunlight. White half-cur
tains of dainty muslin and others of green
screen the gue.stp from the street, but do
not obscure the view from within. Potted
palms are arranged along the windows,
and the tete-a-tete tables are bright with
violets. Two counters occupy the back yf
the room, with a wall of shelf behind. One
window at the rear is given over to leath
er work, and there are china showcases
here and there full of dainty ware.
The cooking is done downstairs now,
and a dumbwaiter brings up the steaming
soups, etc. A large room Is fitted up for
consignors, and a second is the pantry.
All visitors to-day were loud In their
praises, while the attendance was, In spite
of the remowal, not at all diminished. The
exchange Is doing a splendid but unosten
tatious work In this city, not a few poor
women with dependent families being
able, through contributing different arti
cles of diet, to enjoy a steady income.
Five young ladies are also given employ
ment at the exchange. The directors are
anxious that more subscribers hand In
their names, and are desirous for table
linen and dishes.
Artificial Sight.
'A Russian Inventor has perfected an electrical
appliance, which he claims will enable tho
blind toÂ»Â«e. This will bring: much happiness
to those who have defective eyesight. Another
treat discovery which will bring much happi-
ness to thoÂ«e whose stomachs have become de-
ranged Is Hoetetter's Stomach Bitters. It has
made a world-wide reputation for Itself as a
certain cure for such ailments as Indigestion,
dyspepsia, constipation, biliousness and ma-
laria, fever and as-ue.

The union cloakmakers locked out by

sent a committee to Oakland yesterday to
enlist the sympathy and assistance of tho"
leading cloak dealers of* that city. -The
result was gratifying beyond expectations,
and all^ orders W ill be discontinued until
the matter Is fairly adjusted. The Oak
land dealers expressed considerable as
tonishment when informed that ' no Â¦ ques
tion, of hours or wages was involved, but
that the men were locked out for refusing
to abandon their organization. Kahn
Brothers expressed indignation at the
treatment the men had received and hoped
they would win. Â¦ . * '
:-Mr. Pennoyer of the firm of Taft & Pen
noyer withholds all future orders until
the affair is adjusted. The Columbia and
the London and Paris deal only. with fair
cloak Â¦ houses, and consider the action of
the three firms as an outrage perpetrated
on the employes with the ulterior purpose
of "introducing slum production. Mr.
Kirschner of the Salinger Modern Depart
ment Store said' he did not like such pecu
liar business methods. Traveling, men
were asking prosperity prices" for their
goods on the plea that labor was exor

ANXIETY OVER
THE MANAUENSE
Fears for the Safety of
the Vessel.
WAS BOUND FOR THIS CITY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CAX-L HEADQUARTERS, "WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 2.â
Considerable apprehension is felt In of
ficial circles relative to the safety of the
transport Manauense. The Manauense
left Manila for San Francisco on Decem
ber 8 and has not since, been heard from.
Vessels leaving Manila subsequent to the
date of her departure have reached San
Francisco and have not reported that they
discovered any trace of her. . She is very
greatly overdue, and in view of her. condi
tion, as shown by the experience of the
vessel on her way to Manila with troops
aboard, it would not surprise the officials
very much to learn that she had found
ered. â¢
So far as the War Department was in
formed by General Otis, no officers or en
listed men were on board the Manauense
when she left Manila. Her officers und
crew were furnished by her owners, and
the relatives of some of these men have
been writing to the department asking If
it has any information as to the vessel's
whereabouts. It Is known at the 'depart
ment that her machinery was not in good
condition, and it is considered possible
that her engines may have, broken down
and the vessel been blown out of ' h<Â»r
course, and that only temporary repairs
could be made, necessitating slow steam
ing.
The department is inexpressibly . glad
that, although the Manauense had such a
trying experience on her way to: Manila,
she reached that port safely, as. she had
a regiment of soldiers aboard. In case the
vessel reaches San Francisco the depart
ment will decline to pay any, claim that
her owners may. present for the return
voyage but will be willing to compromise
on a basis "of the time she would ilia ye
made had she been in- good condition. The
department agreed to charter the. ship
only after she had been carefully.inspect
ed and upon the rating that she was a
first-class vessel. | - .-'â¢'* â¢ \> .
Death of Samuel Alexander.
Samuel Alexander, father of Leo and
Michael Alexander, agents of the Smith
Premier Typewriter, died yesterday after
a short illness. The deceased was en
gaged as a merchant In this city until
ISSS, when he retired. He was highly es
teemed by all who knew him. . .
Even at. that all Seymour dared to say Is
that Blggy had a railroad ticket, not a
pass, although' Seymour says Blggy told
him that Senator (now Attorney General)
Ford had given him the ticket.
Attorney â¢ General Ford-, denies point
blank that he ever save Bigrgy a railroad
pass In his life. He goes further and
says the present Police Commissioner
never asked him for onel \ ':,
That is the case of the Esola-Phelan
plotters, their yellow organ and its ver
miform . appendix. They ha\*e produced
as their xhief witnesses "the wealthy"
Jacobs and ex-Senator Seymour of
Sari Bernardino, a known railroad legis
lator. They' put on the stand ex-Senators
Fay. and Ford, and both' fall down on
them. .' . . Â¦
Against "the wealthy" Jacobs' charge Is
the irrefutable testimony of Southern'Pa
ciflc receipts to Mr. Bigrgy,. backed up by
the. absolute denials of Mr. Blggy him
self, a man whose honesty Is vouched for
even by: his present bitter enemies, Mayor
Phelan and the Examiner. ;-,.'Â¦'
And right here. It may be well to notice
another thing. The Examiner, in its new
est frenzy, to besmirch a man it cannot
use-r-althoogh it has devoted columns in
eulogy of his Integrity-has taken recent
occasion to say that Biggy's alleged dis
honesty was -known as far back as 1895.
;*Mt was notorious at -the time in Sacra-:
mento.". the Examiner said yesterday.
If it -was ndtorious, why, for five
years, lias the Examiner, knowing
Bi lfgr7 to be dishonest, proclaimed
in season and out, in columns and
columns of type, that BIGGY WAS
HONEST?
The people know! They know that
the Examiner's statement that Biggy
was notoriously dishonest as far back
as 1895 is a LIE.
They know that in making that
statement the Examiner is following
its usual policy of trying to make
one lie stick by telling another.
| They know the Examiner.
He Married Another.
Barbara Felstel filed suit yesterday.
agalnsfJohn Kessler to recover $3000 dam
ages for breach of promise. Plaintiff "al
leges that on November 17, 1597, Kessler
asked her to become his bride. She ac
cented his proposal, but subsequently he
proved untrue, and in May of 1599 married
Miss Kuniguhde Heeg. For his fickleness
she now demands judgment against him

BEAUTIFUL VICTIM OF ANOTHER PARK TRAGEDY.
A VEIL, of mystery, hangs over the death of a young woman found In m
Golden Gate Park yesterday afternoon . with' a bullethole in her head. 1
Whether she was the victim of a murderer or ended her own life will
not be known until the autopsy physician at: the Morgue makes his re- â¢
port, as the pistol that was used cannot be found. As yet her Identity Is. a se- |
cret- On her belt clasp are the initials "A. M." and on her purse the letter
"A.," which induces the Morgue officials to believe that she will be quickly -
identified. . â¢ Â¦
Detectives Cody and Dillon, who are Investigating the case, scout the Idea Â¦
that murder was committed. They base their conclusions on the statement "
made by Park Policeman Dow, who saw the young woman sitting on a bench -
near the entrance of the park on Wednesday night. He saw that she was de- â¢
spondent and kept close watch on her, but she managed to elude him, and he *
did not see her again until he gazed on her dead body. Added to this fact, a |
box containing eleven cartridges was found by her side. There were nine g
cartridges of 38-caliber and two of a larger size, and the police believe that |
the one which will complete the dozen will be found In her head. {
It is believed that the fatal shot was fired during the early hours of the |
morning, as the clothes of the unfortunate girl were still wet from the rain, m
A small boy named Will Stroughberg notified Captain Thompson of the pres- |
ence of the body in the park. . He said that a man about 35 years of age, s'.x (
feet tall and weighing 150 pounds hod called his attention to the body. Captain |
Thompson whistled for assistance and repaired to the spot, which was about 4
200 feet from the Hayes street entrance of the park. He found the body of a I
girl about 22 years old and weighinc about 115 pounds lying on the ground in a 4
pool of blood. He then notified the Coroner and the body was removed to the |
liorgue. The dead girl is described as prepossessing, with dark brown hair f
and blue eyes. On her person was found a gold chain, which may have been I
attached to a watch, but no timepiece was found on her.- A purse containing â¬
512 20, a key and an advertisement clipping from a newspaper were also found. I
Officer Dow found a number of scraps of paper near the spot where he m
first saw the unfortunate girl, and these were taken to the Morgue and an at- I
tempt was made to put them together, but with poor success. Two signa- â¬
tures were barely made out. One was "Ad," probably the girl's name, and th<3 I
other "M. Waupt" or "Ward," a person unknown to the police. â¬
GEORGE POETZ'S LUCK.
ThÂ© Case Against the Boy Collector
of C. E. Whitney & Co. Dismissed.

He was a very nice hoy and he felt very
sorry for him. Even now he did not tmnK
the boy was dishonest. A demand had
been made for the money and checks ana
they had been given up.
Detective Cody said he would not swear
to the complaint.. He had assisted In re
covering the stolen money and checks
and that was all he knew about It. : .

miss the case as no one seemed Inclined

At hoqn yesterday there, was not a ship
in sight from the Merchants' Exchange

TWO MEN AND A WOMAN
FOUND DEAD IN A SALOON.
While Under the Influence of Liquor; Gas Escapes From a
. Stove'; and Suffocates Them.- â¢'â¢â¢
Â«F\? TRAGEDY in low life, which resulted in. the death of', three persons, j
/Z_A\ was enacted, yesterday morning in the rear room, of a saloon kept by
H D. Peterson,, one of the victims, at B2S Third street. â¢Â¦ ' .-. â¢ .... i
During tho-early part of Thursday evening- an'elderly woman, well
under the influence of liquor,, staggered into' Clarence Hughes' restaurant on*
Third street/opposite South Park,- and, telling the proprietor that she" was in
destitute circumstances,' asked for assistance.. Â¦.;.'â¢ ' : . . .â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ Â¦-I
Her condition. was such that the proprietor ordered her frdm" the : place."
and she was seen to go into Peterson's saloon, next door. Soon after the res
taurant people heard the noise of singing and dancing coming from the .sa
loon, and at midnight, when Hughes closed his place, the orgle- was at its
height. ' â¢ ' ' â¢ Â¦â¢;...... . Â¦â¢ â¢ . .. ;. . Â¦
At 11 o'clock. yesterday morning the saloon not. being open,. Hughes
knocked at the door and, getting no response, went to the back door, looked
In and saw some one on the. bed in the room,' but' as the door was locked he
walked away, after failing to rouseaiiy one,- Â¦- â¢ â¢ .' V ââ¢Â¦ '_Â¦' '. . !
When the saloon had not been opened at 3 o'clock Hughes summoned
Officer O'Shea, who, oh breaking "open the back door, found the room filled
with gas and Peterson, the proprietor, Michael Amott.' a Norwegian sailor,
and the unknown" woman in the' room,' dead. . 'â¢ ' â¢ ' " ' ;â¢ ' ' .
Peterson was undressed in. bed, Amott was lying on the floor partjy
dressed, and the woman was partly lying on a rough couch in one corner.
A double-burner gas stove connected with the .fixtures by a long rubber tube
stood against the wall with the. cock turned on full and the hat of Amott
covering one of the burners. : *. '; ' .' ' . .'
From the disordered appearance of the room It is evident that the'par
ties had drunk considerable liquor after the saloon had' been closed and. had
kept up their orgle until early in the morning, when they fell asleep.- In
some manner the hat fell from a nail over the stove and extinguished the
flame, leaving the gas flowing. ' '....' :
Peterson resided with his wife at 1107 Folsom street, but of late bad been
sleeping in the rear of the saloon/ Amott has been waiting for a position in
the Alaska canneries, and for the past month has' frequently occupied the
room with Peterson. The woman wore a dress of cheap mourning material,
small bonnet covered with a long crepe veil arid a cape of nigger-head
cloth. Her hair. was cut short. and her face had a dissipated look. .She was
probably 50 years of age. All three bodies are at the. Morgue* - -;'
CUT HER OWN THROAT.
Mrs. John Capurra Makes an TJnsuc-
cessful Attempt on Her Life.
Mrs. John Qapurra was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital yesterday after having
tried to kill herself by cutting her throat.
She lives with her husband and five chil
dren at 516 Filbert street. Her wounds
were not serious and she will be able lo
leave the hospital to-day.
No one who knew anything, about the
woman's attempt upon her life would talk
of it. One of .the neighbors said there was
some difficulty between the woman and
her husband over their recent change of
residence from Berkeley to this city. Thoy
owned a home . over there*, but Mrs.
Capurra wished to . live . . here, â¢so they
moved. The ill feeling that followed is as
signed as the cause of the woman's act.
SHERIFF HOLDS THE ROAD.
Sierra Valley Railway Attached for
Unpaid State Taxes.
The Sierra Valley Railway has temporr
arily suspended operations on account of
being in the hands of the Sheriff of les
sen County, and to-day that portion of the
road in Plumas County will be seized by
the Sheriff of that county. The company
has a little rolling stock, .thirty miles of
track and a franchise.' It also owes the
State $3200 for ..taxes. Notice was reneat
edly served on the officers of the company
that the taxes should be- paid, but to no
purpose, and at last Attorney General
Tireyli. Ford brought action against the
company, received judgment and had. an
execution Issued.' Still no movement was
made toward liquidation, and he ordered
that the Sheriffs do their duty. Yester
day the road was attached, and then the
owners kept the telephone wires busy
asking the Attorney General how a. re
lease could be effected. The answer was,'
"Dig up the cash," which is promised.

GOMMODORE ISIDOR GTJTTE. a well-known Insurance man and a
member of the board of freeholders that passed on the new charter,
gave his views yesterday on t^e attempt to make Esola Chief of Po
lice. He sajs It* has been a bad mess all around, and "if, as stated, the
Mayor attempted to force Esola's election he made a mistake." It is left with
the people to Judge whether or not the Mayor has made and Is still making
such an attempt. Commodore Gutte says:
The attempt to make Esola Chief of Police should have been
dropped as soon as it was found that a larg-Â« proportion of the peo
ple -were opposed to his selection. Ido not know anything about
Esola. but the immense opposition to his selection should have been
Â«nough to cause his withdrawal at the outset.
This has bÂ«en a bad mess all around. If,' as has been stated,
the Mayor attempted to force Esola's election, he made a mistake.
If ke made a compact before the municipal election to make this
man Chief of Police, it is -worse still. I am not convinced that the
Mayor did any of these things, but if he did it is very bad. Until I
get proof satisfactory to me I will be a supporter of Mr. Phelan.
This whole affair is to be very deeply regretted, . as it will
make it hard to get a decent man to run for Mayor in the future.
All boards or commissions appointed should be left to act as their
'Judgment dictates. Of course, the Mayor, being the responsible head,
of the municipality, should have the privilege of recommending, but
he should not attempt to force the appointment of any bad or in
competent man, nor should he be allowed to carry out any such at
','tempts* >v;.'-': : ;-;' .;â¢Â¦ 'â¢''Â¦;'Â¦'.Â¦"

FREEHOLDER GUTTE SAYS IT
IS A BAD MESS ALL AROUND
IS9j, on the floor of the Senate by then
Senator Blggy, was the first picked upon.
Bisgy at that time was fighting the Mar
ket Street Railway Company's bill for
the repeal of the McCoppin five-cent fare
act. ..
."I understand," exclaimed . Blggy on
that occasion, "that there la a combine. in
the Senate of twenty-two members, hire
lings of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, and I dare them to pass this
bill."
"Sit down!" said Seymour of San Ber
nardino, who was the head of the com
bine, "Sit down; you'll get yourself into
trouble.'? : .
From that day until the moment" the
yellow Journal and its appendix gave the
ex-Senator from San Bernardino his first
opportunity to get back at Blgrry he has
had no love for the San* Franciscan.
