famous cablegram about the battle of
Modder River, "Bloodiest battle of the
century." Another of these, received only
a day or two ago, was "Darkness after
dawn."
The Westminster Gazette says: "There
is no news from the Modder, if we except
the news which has reached us In letters
from troops with Methuenâ letters which
have thrown a very unpleasant light on
the feelings of the men toward their com
mander and which explain several cir
cumstances hitherto Inexplicable which
attended the rout of the Highland Bri
gade at the battle of Magersfontein. The
Impression among the men under him un
doubtedly seems to be that Methuen sent
them' forward to what proved a death
trap In spite of the remonstrances of
Wauchope and the senior officers of his
staff.
"Even If Methuen acted rashly and neg
lected ordinary military precautions he
would not be so much to blame as tho
authorities who placed him in a position
of. such great responsibility. If it can be
shown that the commander in chief had
reason to believe Methuen was not a skill
ful, cautious commander or that he was
not in possession of a well balanced mind,
but gave him the appointment from a
feeling of friendship or personal regard,
then the commander In chief Is far more
worthy of blame than the general whose
actions , are now under discussion."
A Highland Brigade man's letter in the
Glasgow. Herald says; "There is not the
slightest doubt that Methuen has lost the
confidence of every man in the Highland
Brigade. I am not going too far in. say
ing they are afraid to trust their lives to
him." ! â¢-i Â¦' :Â«> >'
BRITISH TROOPS TO
USE EXPANDING BULLETS
.LONDON. Jan. 12, 4 a. m.â Lee-Metford
cartridges are running short in the British
magazines and according to a semi-official
report the War Office purposes to fall
back temporarily upon 100,000.000 "Mark
IV" expanding bullets, most of which are
already in 6torage In South Africa.
The War. Office, however, has Issued a
strict order to the volunteers that the
fifty rounds of '"Mark. lV" given them
must be used In practice at home, nothing
being taken to . South ' Africa. ?
After. the public announcement that no
such bullet would be used in this war. Its
employment, - the Dally Chronicle thinks,
would >be ;a serious ' breach b of r faith, es
pecially, as the British commanders have
complained that the Boers occasionally
usesuch projectiles.
The newspapers were reconciled Â¦ during
confirmation were current last
evening with reference to pro
ceedings at the front. It was
stated at the West End and else
where that news of an important
engagement, in which- General
Buller was concerned, has been
received.
Reports about General Lord
Methuen continue to reach Lon
don, but the war officials are
very reticent about them. The
latest story says that the in
juries which General Methuen
sustained when he was . wounded
proved more serious than was at
first apprehended. His charger,
it is said, reared and threw him
heavily, causing injuries which
have led to a severe spinal
trouble. Others state that since
his defeat at Magersfontein the
British commander has hardly
been responsible for his actions.
METHUEN'S STRANGE
CONDUCT AND TELEGRAMS
NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â A special to the
Journal from London says: This is the
true story of the battle of Magersfontein:
General Lord Metheun's inexplicable con
duct of the campaign for the relief of
Klmberley, culminating In the awful
blunder and bloodshed of that defeat, has
caused endless gossip.
Reports that Lord Metheun was insane
have been current, but the English news
papers have printed only the most gar
bled allusions to . them. . . .
Lord Methuen is not a strong. man. He
is an athlete, a good: boxer and" all-round
sportsman, but is ; frail . physically. AJ
most immediately after he took command
of the division in the West of Cape Col
ony he showed signs of breaking. down. '.
Then began coming Â» to â¢ the War Office
dispatches that did not seem to be those
or -a well-balanced man. As witness his
and grew to be a favorite In his profes
sion.
Shortly after being admitted to the
practice of medicine Dr. Mahe married a
Miss Mosgrove. the daughter of a mer
chant who was formerly engaged in busi
ness on Kearny street. His wife was
pretty and accomplished and a favorite
in society. The young physician seemed
devoted to her and nothing marred their
marital bliss until the unhappy events fol
lowing sudden good fortune.
A little more thaa two years ago Dr.
Mahe received notification that a wealthy
relative had died in France and left him
heir to an Immense fortune. He departed
for tha Continent and was gone two
months. During hla absence Mrs. Maho
spent the time with relatives and friends
In the Santa Clara Valley.
When the physician returned he took
offices on Sutter street above Powell and
furnished them In palatial style. He lived
happily with his wife during this period.
so far as is known, and whether he found
pleasure at times in the society of others
of the fair sex nobody knows.
It was during a visit of the wife in the
Santa Clara Valley, shortly after her hus
band's return from the Continent, that the
elopement occurred which brought sorrow
and disgrace Into the family and set the
tongue of scandal wagging. Mrs. MaliÂ©
arrived home to discover her husband
gone and not a line to indicate his where
abouts. From anxiety her mind was af
flicted with agonizing fears that he had
accidentally met with death or been mur
dered, and her grief is described by
friends of the physician as having been
something pitiable. In time she learned
that the man whom she had loved wai
unworthy of her trust and affection, and
when the wounds had healed she procured
a divorce.
From that day to this nothing was
heard of the eloping pair until the brief
telegram was received last night stating
the fact that he had committed suicide at
Sioux City. It Is not even known whetner
the woman mentioned In the dispatch had
been married to him since the divorce was
granted his wife or not. According to
George Dahlenberg. the druggist, several
of the physician's patients had called from
time to time and Inquired after his where
abouts. The supposition was that ne had
gone either to St. Louis or New Orleans,
but according to the dispatch it wonlrt
seem that he had spent the entire period
abroad since his departure.

Very Strong Testimony Presented by
Experts in the Mollneux Mur

NEW YORK, Jan. 11.â The principal
witness to-day In the trial of Roland B.
Mollneux for the murder of Katherine J.
Adams was Professor Rudolph H. Witt
haus, the well-known chemist, who made
an analysis of Mrs. Adams' stomach as
well as of various portions of Harry C.
Barnet's exhumed body and of the box
containing an effervescent salt which It Is
said Barnet took before his death.
Dr. Witthaus said that he found mer
curic cyanide in the contents of the Bar
net box and the common constituents of
kutnow powder. He found a small quan
tity of cyanide and mercury in Barnet's
liver. In the kidneys he found mercury
and In the brain mercury.
Witness then took up the Adams case.
In the deadly bromo-seltzcr bottle Profes
sor Witthaus eald all the constituents of
the powder found by him were the regular
constituents of bromo-seltzer except mer
cury and cynanogen.
Mrs. Florence E. Rogers, daughter of
Mrs. Adams, who was present at the time
of her mother's death, described the poi
soning. Mrs. Rogers was very self-pos
sessed and showed no emotion. Her story
agreed with that told by Harry Cornish.
A long cross-examination did not shake
her testimony.
Professor Witthaus will go on the' stand
a^aln to-morrow to testify as to his an

which Mrs. Adams drank the fatal
draught and as to his analysis of Â¦ Mrs.
Adams' stomach.
PARLIAMENT CALLED.
LONDON, Jan. 11.â The Queen has pro
claimed the meeting of Parliament for
January 8*
LONDON, Jan. 12.âTer
rible losses on both sides
are reported as the result
of the fierce battle at Ladysmith
on Saturday. While nothing
official has been given out as to
the British casualties, a sum
mary of them has been received
in London in which it is stated
that they amount to fourteen of
ficers killed and thirty-four
wounded, and 800 men of the
rank and file killed or wounded.
That is a heavy percentage in a
force which probably did not
muster more than 8500 fit for
duty.
The Boer losses are placed by
the same report at between two
and three thousand. Manifestly
there must be a good deal of
conjecture about the latter fig
ures, yet it must be remembered
that the righting lasted for
seventeen hours and that the
Boers were attackihg intrenched
positions. If these figures are
correct they show very clearly
the determined nature of the
fighting.
No movement is reported in
any direction in South Africa.
All the columns are inactive and
apparently waiting directions
from the new commander-in
chief.
Last night at the War Office
was the quietest since the com
mencement of the campaign.
At midnight it was announced
that nothing would be issued be
fore morning.
Day by day the flood of criti
cism of the War Office for its
blindness, incapacity, favorit
ism in appointments and snob
bishness in refusing offers of
volunteers, both home and colo
nial, is increasing. When the
barriers are broken down whom
will it sweep away?
A number of rumors which
which were absolutely lacking of
were made for them to meet at the
church. The marriage was to take place
at 8 o'clock. On arriving there they en
tered the house and about the time the
ceremony was to begin Miss Ruiz spoke
up and said:
"Tell him I will not become his wife
and for him to go home."
It was like a thunderclap, as no one
was expecting anything of the kind. She
was asked to repeat the words in his
presence, but this she refused to do. It
is rumored that all of her befit clothe*
were taken from her and burned, and
that she was compelled to go to the
church in mere rags. This is given as one
of the excuses for her actions.
Miss Ruiz is without doubt the most
beautiful young lady in Santa Barbara,
a pure Castillan and a descendant of one
of the oldest families in the State. Her
uncle, with whom she lives, is the lead
ing druggist here, likewise Coroner and
Public Administrator, and was bitterly
opposed to the match. While he regTets
greatly the publicity of the affair, he
seems somewhat relieved. She will be
remembered as the lady who has 'acted
as the Goddess of Liberty. Eureka and
many other parts in floral festivals and
entertainments given in this city. She Is
22 years of age and of perfect form.
Mr. Carrillo was born and raised in
Santa Barbara. He likewise comes of a
good family, but is of a sporty disposi
tion, a swell dresser and is known as one
of the young men about town and is well
liked. When seen to-day he said that he
had enough. It was as close as he . had
ever come to marriage, and he expected
to drop the matter where it now stands.
He feels badly over the result of his first
venture, but he also is somewhat relieved
from the anxiety of his first real ro
mance.

trÂ»c!al Dispatch to The Call

ding that was to take place here
last night between Michael Car
rillo and Miss Lucy Ruiz termi
nated in a most unexpected man
ner, as the bride refused to con-
Bent to the marriage after all necessary
arrangements had been made. The pa
rents of the young lady had objected
strongly to tbe match, claiming that Mr.
Carrfllo was not her equal; that he was
inclined to be sporty, and they looked for
a much better future for herâ yet, with
all their protests, she was determined to
have her way in the matter, although she
was forbidden to speak to him and a
continual watch kept over her to prevent
any possibility of a runaway marriage.
For several months they have been kept
In close communication by a system of
notes delivered by a cousin of the pros
pective bride, and everything seemed to
be looking bright for the time when they
would be husband and wife.
Lsxst Monday a marriage license was se
cured and arrangements made for a se
cret wedding that night; a scheme was
planned whereby she might escape the
watchful eyes of her relatives and when
the deed had been done return and seek
forgiveness of the unsuspecting family.
The plan worked excellently until they
reached the residence of the Rev. Father
Stockman, who, as ill luck would have It,
bad been called to Lob Angeles, and with
out his consent the wedding could not
take place; so the young couple were
compelled to return to their homes and
the lady forced to divulge the nature of
her absence from home. She then ram*
out and asserted that Fhe would marry
her lover regardless of the wishes of the
family and. though a strong Catholic,
threatened to have the ceremony per
formed by a Justice of the Peace, Seeing
co other way out of the matter, the pa
rents finally consented to the wedding.
All day yeeterday she was kept locked
In a room and no one was allowed to see
her. Her spiritual adviser visited the
house, but he was refused admittance,
and was not even allowed to ask her In
her relatives' presence if she had con
sented to become the wife of Mr. Car

CHOATE CABLES THE
ANSWER OF ENGLAND
â¢WASHINGTON. Jan. 11.â The answer of
the British Government to Mr. Choate's
representations respecting the seizure of
American flour' and other goods on the
three vessels, Beatrice, Mashona and Ma
ria, has been received. Just as the offi
cials of the State Department expected. It
amounted to a partial answer, very satis
factory as far as it goes, disposing of the
character of some of the goods seized, but
not finally deciding whether or not food
stuffs are to be regarded as contraband.
The British Government adopts precisely
the point iÂ»t .view regarding the seized
goods that was assumed by the State De
partment and embodied by Mr. Choate In
his note on the subject addressed to the
British Foreign Office. In brief, Mr.
Choate reports as follows:
That the answer Is highly satisfactory;
that it is on broad and liberal terms. The
position assumed by the British Govern
ment is that foodstuffs in transit to a hos
tile destination can be regarded as con
traband of war only when they are sup
plies for the enemy's forces. It Is not suf
ficient that they are capable of beta* used
for the benefit of the enemy. It must ba
shown that they are so in fact by their
destination at the time of seizure. Tho
British Government does not claim that
any of the American goods on the Dutch
bark Maria and the British bark Ma
shona were contraband of war. The Brit
ish Government is investigating the facts
in connection with the goods seized on me
third vessel, the Beatrice. vj Â¦
Mr. Choate's ' message embodied suc
cinctly the authorities relied upon by the
British Government to sustain its position,
and as the position, as already stated. Is
one of those already assumed by the
State Department, of course they regard
ed It as convincing. For this reason Mr.
Choate's message is long and it was nearly
noon before it could be deciphered and
placed in Secretary Hay's hands.
"Later in the day the following official
statement was given out by the State De
partment:
"A telegram has been received from Em
bassador Choate reporting an Interview
had by him with the Marquis of Salisbury
on the afternoon of the 10th lnst. In re
gard to the American shipments of flour
and provisions on the detained British
vessels Beatrice and Mashona and the
Dutch bark Maria. The British posi
tion as to foodstuffs and hostile destina
tion is that they can only be considered
contraband of war if supplied for tha
enemy's forces, it not being sufficient that
they are capable of being so used, but It
must be shown that this was their destin
ation at the time of seizure. This quali
fication virtually concedes the American
contention that the goods were not sub
ject to seizure and practically disavows,
the seizure, it not being claimed that
there Is any evidence of hostile destina
tion."
The next step will be the collection of
data by the State Department and by tha
British Foreign Office to fully establish
the character of the goods on the Beat
rice and It is not expected that there will
meantime be any further deliveries by tha
British Government upon the general sub
ject of the contraband character of food
stuffs.

rumor from Paris that General Buller had
met with another defeat.
DR. GUSTAVE MAHE, the young
physician whose desertion of his
wife In this city and elopement with
another woman about two years
ago furnished Dame Grundy with a choice
morsel, has rung down the curtain on the
final act of his own life and will fill a
suicide's grave.
The news of the young physician's sad
end reached this city last evening in a
telegram to a friend from Sioux City.
lowa. The only facts given were that he
had been found dead In his office early In
the evening. Although no cause for the
act could be learned It was suspected that
he had taken his own life, as a half
emptied bottle of laudanum lay on the
table by his side, along with a graduate
for doses, still containing a small quan
tity of the drug. The dispatch further
stated that Dr. Mahe came to Sioux City
from New York a short while ago with
his wife, who Is prostrated by the shock.
Previous to their arrival in New York the
couple had been abroad for two years.
The story of the young physician's
elopement is still fresh In the minds of
the public and created a sensation in this
city at the time. His domestic relations
apparently had been happy and no motive
could be 'magined for his sudden disap
pearance until It was learned that he had
fallen a worshiper at the shrine of an
other Â¦woman and had departed in order
to enjoy her smiles in a broader sphere.
For some time Mrs. Mahe lay HI on ac
count of the shock causing nervous pros
tration. Nothing was heard of the pair
after they left this city until last night.
Dr. Mahe was an exceedingly handsome
man and of a magnetic personality. He
was born in California and was the son
of the president of the old French Bank,
located on Bush street, opposite where
the California Theater now stands. Many
years ago the bank failed and the father,
unable to bear the strain of financial mis
fortune, took his own life in a fit of
despondency.
For a long time the son was a clerk In
a local dry goods store, but his ambition
was not satisfied with that station in life
and he went to medical college, graduat
ing with honors. He. set up an office at
640 Clay street and gradually worked up
a good practice. He removed from there
about four years ago and took an office
on Kcarny street, over Dahlenberg's
drugstore. There he made many friends

DISGUISED in his sister's clothes
Joseph Angules, aged 18 years,
shot Joseph Rogers Boares at Cen
terville last night after leading the
victim into a trap by reason of the
disguise. Soares is not expected to live
arfl Angules was brought to the County
Jall in Oakland to-night with a charge of
murder hanging over his head. His Justi
fication for the act is that Soares had
been talking about his sister Minnie, but
the reason which led the young man to
disguise himself in his sister's clothes is
cot quite go clear.
The fact that young Angules was thus
Â£isgru!sed pave rise to the story that the
g^.rl herself had shot Soares. but young
Angules confessed to the act and was
brought to Oakland to-night- The south
ern part of the county le intensely agi
tated over the affair, particularly as this
it not the first occasion the Angules girls
have come into notoriety of a very simi
lar character.
About a year ago Joseph Joaquln, a
Toting Portuguese of Centerville, was In
vited to the Angules house and when he
arrived he was assaulted with pitchforks
end severely wounded. The girls were ax
rested but discharged.
The ehootir.g was the culmination of a
feud between the youth and the Injured
man which commenced about three
months ago. Quarrels have been of fre
quent occurrence, although they were
never apparently of a serious nature.
Generally the man Â¦who is now suffering
from a bullet hole through his body was
the apgressor. He has bitterly taunted
the boy about his sister and as events
fhow these taunts finally goaded the
youth to desperation.
Soares is L 5 years old and lives with his
vife and family on a ranch adjoining the
Ar.gules place. He was apparently en
amored of Minnie, aged 23, one of the
two Angules sifters with whom the boy
lived, and frequently asked the latter to
arrange for her to meet him.
"I've got a mash on your sister," old
Foar^s would remark on other occasions.
Yesterday afternoon the amor-is old
rancher met his young neighbor a:. a again
asked him to arrange a meeting with itin-
Cle.
"She told me to have you come around
to-night." replied the boy.
Then he clipped home, and quickly don
ning his sister's dress he procured a re
volver and awaited the coming- of Soares.
When the latter arrived he was met on
tbe porch of the Angul*s domicile by the
masquerading youth. Soares penetrated
the disguise almost immediately, and
jnade a lunge at young Angules. As he
Â£ld bo the boy threw up the revolver anC
pulled the trigger. The bullet struck
goares In the ltft breast, and he turned
and ran to his home, dropping to the
floor unconscious as he entered the houss.
Several doctors were called and found the
bullet had lodged In the muscles of the
back, next to the spine. Soares was sink
ing rapidly to-night and but little hope
for his recovery is entertained.
Joe Angules. when seen at the County
Jail to-night, at first declared emphatical
ly that he would make no statement, be
cause his attorney, Mr. Mlchels, and Con
stable Joe Rodriguez had told him "to
keep his mouth shut." However, he final
ly ignored their advice and talked.
"Yes. I shot Soares," said Angules. "and
although I am sorry for it now. I did not
do anything but what any man would
have done for his sisters. Soares has been
a neighbor of ours for the past ten or
twelve years, and ever since three months
ago he has been teasing me whenever he
met me on the road. He would pinch me
and then tell me to ask my twin sisters
If they would not meet him, and that he
liked Minnie. He kept this up until I could
stand it no longer.
"Last Sunday he met me and began
pinching me again. Then he told me that
he had nine borres to attend to, and after
that he would like to meet my sisters. I
asked him, not meaning anything wrong,
why I couldn't meet one of his daughters,
and he said if ever he saw one of his girl?
In my company he would shoot me. H?
said the difference between his daughters
and my sisters. Annie and Minnie, was a
very big proposition. I knew what he
meant and considered it an insult such as
I never heard before.
"Yesterday I asked Minnie to lend me
some of her clothes. I borrowed a skirt
and her shawl. I was going to disguise
myself as my sister Minnie, and I told
her I was going to fool some one, but I
don't think Minnie knew Â¦what I was real
ly going to do.
"Then I rode on my wheel to town
and met Soares. As I jumped off my
wheel he pinched me again and asked if
I had made a date with Minnie for him.
I told him yes: that she was waiting on
the porch for him. Then I hurried home,
put on my sister's skirt and drew the
shawl around my shoulders and, with tha
revolver that we have always kept In
the house, sat on the porch waiting for
Soares to come along.
"He came all right about 8:S0, and I got
up and stood on the porch. I tried to
talk like a girl, but he saw my big shoes,
I guess, and said he didn't want to see
me, but my sister Minnie. Then he made
a leap at me and I raised my pistol and
shot him. He ran away toward his house
as fast as possible, leaving his hat be
hind. I had Intended to get him into the
house and Rhoot him there, because I did
not like to shoot him outside, but I got
so mad I couldn't stand it any longer.
The girls don't blame me a bit. I took
their part, and any man would do that.
Somn of the people thought Aside did thÂ«
shooting, because they all knew she was
against him.
"Of course. I am afraid I'll g-et the
worst of it. because I have no money for
lawyers, but I was not obliged to tell my
story if I didn't want to."

CULLEN'S HOARDED
GOLD UNEARTHED
Since the Miser's Death the Premises
Have Been Visited and Care
fully Dug' Over.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE, Jan. 11.â The hoarded
wealth of old Dennis Cullen, a bachelor
rancher- of Calaveras Valley, has been
dug up and'Btolen and the special admin
istrator, and attorney of the estate are
looking for these self-appointed legatees.
Cullen .died December 5 last. For o%'er a
quarter of a century he had farmed and,
raised cattle In the Calaveras hills. He
owned" eighty acres of good land where he
lived, and another claim of lfiO acres as a*
cattle pasture. He lived in the most fru
gal manner, beans and salt pork being
mostly his diet, lie banked his money in
the ground, and stories of his great treas
ure troves were current among the neigh
bors. Cullen 'trusted no bank.
During the past few days unknown par
ties have visited the place and found the
money. Beneath his old home are great
holes, and the entire space has been
dug over. The floor of the barn was
also dug up. About the place in what
would have seemed safe spots for the old
hermit to have burled his yellow gold are
great excavations. Near the .house on
the edge of jan excavation were found
two glass jars having 1 the appearance of
having been buried for years, nnd It was
in these receptacles that part of the treas
ure was probably hidden. The searchers
were evidently satisfied with their find,
for they left their tools alongside the jars.
Special Administrator C. D. Beverson
made this report to-day to Attorney C. L.
Witten, who was Cullen's attorney.
It Is thought that Cullen had at least
$20,000 buried. He always had good crops,
and his fat cattle found a ready sale.
During the past* season It Is known Cullen
received $1500 for the sale of cattle and
grain, and this money cannot be found.
He did not have an account at any of the
banks. Cullen never spent a cent. It is
believed he had fully $20,000 in bills and
gold buried.
Cullen's only relatives are three sisters-
Mrs. Rosa Sparks of San Francisco and
Mrs. Maria Gaffney and Mrs. Broyerty,
both residing in Ireland. By a will exe
cuted a few hours before his death the
entire estate was left to Mrs. Spar.ks, who
was named to serve as executor without
bonds. A contest has already been filed
by W. C. Kennedy on behalf of the heirs
In Ireland, tho grounds being that Mrs.
Sparks exercised undue Inlluence over
him and that he was unsound of mind at
the time of .making the instrument.
Roger Sherman, one of the witnesses to
the will, has ulready testified that Cullen
was mentally unbalanced when the will
was made. The value of the real property
of the estate is about $15,000.

DROWNED IN THE CREEK.
Body of Little Lawrence Hufford
* Finally Found.
â¢ REDDING, Jan. 11.â The body of 4-year
old Lawrence Hufford was found to-day
in Cloner Creek, where the- child was
drowned. A 'week ago to-day the boy
strayed away, from his home in. the Oak
Run region, thirty miles from Redding.
Since that time all the people within a
radius of ten miles of the Hufford home
have joined in the search for the missing
child. As the search progressed without
result the terrible theory was advanced
that the little one had been killed and
eaten by the wild animals which abound
In that region.

MARTINEZ. Jan. 11.â At midnight Jo
seph P. Jones. Judge of the Superior
Court hero, passed away. His death was
sutjil^n and very unexpected, and has cast
a gloom over the ontire county. He wa3
well known in all parts of the State; hav
ing frequently exchanged with other
Judgf-s to bold trials.
Tuesday, he tried several eas*.-s. and in
the afternoon; Just before leaving court,
FÂ«?t a writ <;f habeas corpus for hearing
next day. Early on Wednesday morning
he was taken ill very suddenly and bo
came unconscious. Drs. Merrlrl and Mul
ligan wore callod in ami kept the spark of
life aglow by stimulants. In th<- evening
L>r. TausslÃ arrived from Oakland; and
the three physicians worked with him till
d'-aih came.
Shortly after 11 his throe boys, who wore
in San Francisco, and had been tele
graphed for, arrived home on the early
evening train. The Judge did not regain
consciousness, but parsed away, sur
rounded by his wife and children and
many relatives who reside In this town.
The deceased was born in Indiana In
1544 and shortly afterward Itis parents
movK) to Oregon, in ISj4 he graduated
from the Willamette University, receiving
the degree of A. H. In J.v.5 he returned to
his native State, and in lsÂ»Â»7 graduated
from the lav.- department of the State
University at Bloomlngton. Iteturning ro
Oregon he drifted Into tho mines of
Northern California and worked there f</r
somo time without success. In lMft became
t<Â» Martinez and commonec-d to practice
law. forming a partnership with li. Mills.
Afterward he entered the District Attor
ney's office as deputy and served till IS7S.
when he was honored by being selected
to till the chief position himself. From
this office he went to tho Assembly ami
was a member of the Judiciary Committee
anil the Committee on Federal Relations.
In ISS.I he was chosen as Superior Judge,
and has succeeded himself at each subse
quent election. If he '.>nA lived till the
end of- this term he would have survoil
sixteen years. During his career asÂ» Judge
ho made an enviable record. But few of
his cases that wont to the Supremo
Court were reversed, and tho Judge was
noted for his probity and rupgod honesty;
Many Important .land cases have boon
tried .before him, especially tho Sobrimtt;
rancho case, which involved tho title to
half the land In the county and hns bocn
In th<Â» courts for tho last twenty years.
During tho psst year Jutlge Jones v/es
(Â¦â¢elected to try the celebrated Hite divorce
case of 2lartposa County, and when the
decision Mas given for Indian I^ucy he
received compliments from all parts <if
the State.
On account of the poor health of tho
widow it is thought tho funeral will bo
held to-morrow. Besides the widow therÂ»
are left to mourn his loss four children â
M. It. Jones, an attorney; Thomas It., a
dentist' of Ran Francisco; Carl 11.. attend*
Ing tho State University, and Pearl Jones.
Flags are at half-mast over the town and
all public offices will be closed on the day
of the funvral.
Attorney Lprnion, who Is associated vuth
Hon. W. \V. Footo, says the cane row
stands exactly as if Judge Jones had
c3on<' nothing with it.
"The action cf the Indian woman was
for a divorce and division of the commu
nity property," said Attorney I^ermen.
"Mr. Hite denied that he ever was n:ar
ric<l to the Indian woman, and the case
was really fought out upon that question.
anil while thÂ« court has already Inform
ally expressed Its opinion on this question,
ami that it would decide against the man
an.l In favor of the woman when the
proper timo came, he died before the time
came and before he had an opportunity
of putting his opinion and decision in
logal form. In .Â«o far as his connection
with the case Is concerned everything that
he has done must be done over again.
"Thf- last act performed by Judge Jones
in th!* matter was merely an expression
of opinion upon his part as to the meiits
of thÂ«> case in so far as the marriage of
tho parties was concerned. There had
bi'cn a previous agreement between noun.
se] and the Judge that the case should lie
first tried solely upon the question of the
marriage of the parties, and that the
questions of property should be held In re
serve untl! fift^r the Judge had heard suf
ficient evidence upon the question of mar
riage and had det^rmlne'd whether or not
in his opinion, carriage had been es
tablished.
"In the event that he didÂ» not think
that the evidence warranted a finding
that tho marriage had been established,
thm there was no ne<Â»d of going inlo the.
questions of property, and in the ewnt
that he was of the opinion that the par
ties had .been married then a subsequent
examination should be held with regard
to the wealth of the defendant to guide
the Judgo in determining how much of
his property should be awarded to the
plaintiff. Tho inquiry had proceeded as
far as tho first stage. Thore was a fur
ther stipulation between the -parties and
tho court that tho question of alimony
ana counsel fees should follow the ques
tion of marriage, ana that the Inquiry
into the question whether or not the par
ties had been married should also be usod
for the piuyose of determining whether
or not tho t'lalntiff was entitled to "any
alimony and counsel feos; in other words,
he was trying both questions at the same
time.
"Thoro was nnt and could not be a com
pletfl trial of tho case until the property
questions had ho ( n sottlod; there was
only ono complete trial,- and until after
tho property questions had boon settled
tho oaso Itself was not determined. The
Judge postponed tho making of an order
awarding any counsel rees and alimony
until tho final determination of the case,
when tho findings would be signed and"
died after tho property questions had been
fully (l^torminod.
"The nf-xt hearing of the case, when
theso matters would be brought up, was
sot for tho 17th of this month, after
which, in all probability, an ordor direct
ing- tho payment of alimony and counsel
fees would bo made and signed by the
Judge, as well, also, the findings of fact
and conclusions of law. which constitute
tho final decision of the trial Judge, when,
nnd not 'before, tho .case would be-com-
Judge Jones' sudden death makes it nec
essary to commence anew the litigation
instituted by Lucy, tho Indian woman,
against John R. Hltc. the M.irlposa mill
ionaire. The first stage of the suit was
concluded some weeks ago. when Jud^e
Jones Intimated that he would find that
there had been a marriage between lilte
and the Indian woman. No ordor has
been made, however, and no findlfigs
drawn up and signed, so the result of the
trial is nullified.
plotrd so far as tho trial itself was con
cerned. No order for counsel fees
having ever been made and signed, and
no findings h.-iving been signed or filed,
the case stands as If no trial hafl ever
been held, the Judge having died before
formally and In legal form expressing his
opinion and making his decision.
"The case Is precisely as if a jury were
trying the case and one or more of the
jurymen should die before a verdict was
renderedâ the case would have to be tried
all over again."

Clubs yesterday filed a petition with the
Board of Supervisors for the abatement of

rock crusher endangers the lives of the
residents in the vicinity and has injured
the value of the surrounding property.
The petition concludes:
"We represent that the rock crusher is
run daily and sometimes during the hours
of night. Blasts have been exploded and
thrown rocks through the houses of Mrs.
Christopher, situated on Clipper and Dia
mond streets; of Barney Matthews, -P.
Zatnitt and other residents. : . The rains
have washed down the screenings and
tailings from the quarry and have filled
the Â»ewers bo that the -proper flow of
storm waters fs prevented, and have also
tilled up the sidewalks from one. to two
feet deep, rendering the fire plugs use
less. House owners have been compelled
to use sand bags to prevent their houses
from being flooded and could not enter
or leave their houses without wading
through water and sllckens up to their
ehoetops."

REEL B. TERRY, one of the best known lawyers of this city, died
yesterday in a sanitarium at Altruria, Sonoma County. His health
began to fail last June. At first the cause of his decline puzzled his
physician, but later It developed that It was spinal trouble due to a
wrench of the muscles of the back, which was aggravated by a severe at
tack of Inflammatory rheumatism. Several inches of his spine were affected,
causing great nervous irritation, accompanied with a complete loss of appe
tite. With his natural grit, Terry refused to give up to his sickness until he
became so weak that he was almost a burden to himself. Shortly after Christ
mas he consented to oe taken to the Altruria' sanitarium for treatment.
He had allowed his malady to gain too much headway, however, and nothing
that medical skill could do offered him any relief, and he sank rapidly. until
the end came yesterday. Deceased was forty years of age.
There was no young man more prominent in this part of the State than
Reel B. Terry. From the time he cast "his first vote he was an earnest
advocate of Democracy, and was prominently Identified with that political
organization, being for years the party leader of Fresno County. He was
elected by a handsoraa majority to the office of District Attorney of Fresno,
and made an enviable record. Later his party nominated him for Congress,
but owing to internal dissensions in the county organization he was de
feated
He was a man outspoken and fearless in all his public career and this
characteristic frequently Brought him into collision with members of his party
who. while admiring his bravery, differed from his views.
Reel Terry's parents died when he was still a boy and he was taken Into
the home of his uncle, the late Judge David S. Terry. He received a
thorough education in the law- and when he branched out for himself he
opened offices at Fresno, where he practiced for nearly sixteen years until
he moved to this city about three years ago. Success marked his career as
an attorney. He was popular with his fellow members of 'the bar. who
deenlv recrret his untimely demise.
Mr. Terry was married to Miss Kelsey, a sister of Mrs. Van R. Pater
son, and besides the widow leaves a daughter. Miss Bernlce, now 17 years old.
Mrs. and Miss Terry left for Altruria yesterday afternoon to arrange for
the funeral.

werq closed, at 12:30 p. m., 40.000 persons.
it Is' '.stlmated. looked upon the face of
the dead. . For four hours a compact
stream of humanity poured into the
church. They moved in pairs up the mid
dle wlsle to the foot of the cotfln; there
they parted, one person going to the right,
the other to the left, and then, after gaz
ing upon the face that had been loved by
so many thousands, they passed out of
the church. Many remained in the church
and the pews were crowded with more
than 2500 persons long before the doom
were closed. At that time there were
many on the street who had not been able
to pain admission.
Tlie head had been slightly raised in
deference to an understood wish that
everybody in thec hurch might see the
features of the dead from different parts
of the church. The purple robes of the
priest still clothed his body nnd a crucifix
was clasped in his hands. The features
wore the same -benevolent expression as
In life.-
The chancel was in black and white. All
the candelabra, altar fixings and altars"
wen* clothed in 'these somber colors, the
white altar cloths having been exchanged
for black -with white fringe. To the left
of the middle" of the sanctuary as one
faced the altar was seen a magnificent
cross of flowers, surmounted by a dove.
To the right was a large pillow of red car
nations, forget-me-nots and mignonette.
Both were striking designs.
Among the first to push their way
through the crowd with the aid of 00 po"
licemen detailed to preserve order in the
vicinity of the church were fifty letter
carriers from the Letter Carriers' Union,
which has held Dr. McOlynn in great re
spect since his aid to them. These men
brought a handsome floral wreath with
old Celtic lettering, reading, "Saga
Theron." or in English, "Our Beloved
Priest."
The obsequies began at 0:30 with a sol
emn chant for the dead, conducted by
Rev. Thomas F: McLoughlin and Rev.
Thomas O'Connor of St. Stephen's.
â¢ The mass of requiem according to the
rules of the Roman Catholic faith was
celebrated by Rev. Charles McCready.
Right Rev. Mgr. J. F, Mboney, vicar gen
eral, delivered the eulogy, and the linal
absolution was. given by Archbishop Cor
rigan. The body was .taken to Calvary
Cemetery in Brooklyn.

Important Modifications Reg-arding

by Attorneys.
A copy of Senate bill No. 1938, intro
duced by Senator Proctor on the 3d of the
present month, changing the mode of en
forcing the provisions of the Chinese ex
clusion act. has reached this city and has
caused considerable flurry in Federal cir
cles.
The biil authorizes ;be Secretary of the
Treasury to commit the administration of
: '-â¢ Chinese exclusion laws to thÂ« Bureau
< f tnuÃicratlotk This bill, if it should be
come a law. wIM tnke the management of
Chinese immigration out of the hands of
the Custom* Collector and entirely re
lieve that official of the annoyance of
Jnoking after a department altogether for
Â« !cb to thai of the collection of duties. At
j his port the examination cf the applica
tions of Chinese for admission takes up
at kast one-third of the time of the Col-
Sector and has caused him to work over
time, ii -1 of which is to the detriment of
iti*> department. Collector Jackson has
devoted more of his persona] time and at
tention to this branch of his duties than
have suiy.of his predecessors, who felt
themselves forced by the pressure of busi
ness in have many of the details to the
< bfefs of th<* Chinese Bureau; thereby
placing temptation In the way of other
wise good men. with the r<-sult that the
bureau hÂ«s reeked with scandal so un
savory ar to be beyond fumigation.
. A partial solution of the difficulty was
attempted when the Secretary of the
rreaeury detailed the present chief, Mr.
Dunn. tÂ«j take charge ef the bureau, but
:t wns found thai this arrangement did
not lighten the burden of the Collector,
because h*- alone -could deny a landing or
allow a landing to a Chinese immigrant.
Thr Treasury Department came to the
conclusion that the business onuld better
he handled by the Immigration Bureau
and without any additional expense, so
that the. Collector of the port of San
FranciSco could devote his whole time
and attention to the duty of collecting
the customs dues. The bill was lntro-
Uucod by Senator Proctor at the request
of the Treasury Department, and there
Is littie doubt that it will pass.
Among the changes in the present reg
ulations made by the bill Is that of the
right and mode of appeal from the judg
mÂ«m of the Immigration Commissioner.
Appeal may be taken to the United States
District Court by a written application of
the I'nited Stat.-s District Attorney, all
appeals to be liied within thrÂ»-e days from

ment or order. An appeal to the Su
preme Ourt of the I'nitcd States from

cif-ion of the immigration ofllcer, if ad
verse to the admission of a Chinese nc:-
pon. shall be final, unless reversed on ap
peal to the Secretary Â«.f the Treasury.

A Chinaman landing clandestinely mu.-t >

Auditor Says Charter Provision Will
Not Cause a Deficit.
Auditor Wells received yesterday an
opinion from his attorney. General Dick
inson, regarding the section of the char
ter which provides (or the transfer to th*Â»
general fund under the charter of
balances of certain funds remain
ing under the consolidation act. The
Auditor was fearful ror a time that
such a course wou'.d create a deficit in
the city's finances before May l next
Hl6 attorney advises him that the lan
guage of the charter Is plain In prescrib
ing his duties with regard to transferring
the balances of all funds except the school
and three or four minor funds to the gen
eral fund. In order to carry out the iPtter
of the charter the Auditor has placed n
placard in his outer olilce reading that no
demands will be signed until after Janu
ary IS. bo that the required transfer of
the funds may be made on his books. '
The Auditor has changed his mind re
garding the prospective deficit In the gen
eral fund which he anticipated from the
provision of the charter referred to. Ha
says now that the moneys for taxes have
been coming in at such a rapid rate that
there will be a sufficiency of coin to carry
on all departments until the end of the
present fiscal year.

Supervisors Requested to Provide
Funds With Which to Pay
Printers.
At the meeting of the Supervisors Print-
Ing Committee yesterday the contract for
printing 5000 copies of the new charter
recently awarded to the Star Press was
considered. L. C. Lovey. manager of the
Star, stated that the Auditor had no
funds with which to pay for printing thÂ»
charter and requested that some action
be taken in the matter. The committee
decided to confer with the Mayor on the
subject.
The clerk was directed to notify all
heada of departments to file requisitions
for stationery and supplies needed In their
offices and to receive bids therefor under
$200.
Consideration of a communication from
the Allied Printing Trades Council re
questing that all city printing be awarded

next Tuesday morning.
SEGREGATING PUBLIC WORK.
The New Board Will Establish Three
Bureaus.
The Board of Public Works was kept
busy all day yesterday perfecting plans
for the establishment of the three depart
ments under Its jurisdiction. These com
prise the bureaus of surveys, construc
tion and public utilities. It was decided
to operate the bureau of surveys as has
been the custom in the City Surveyor's
office. The employes in the latter office
will be retained temporarily and the fees
will be substantially the same as hereto
fore.
A petition from property owners in the
vicinity of San Bruno and Silver avenuea
asking for the establishment of grades
was considered at length, but action was
postponed.
The Civil Service Commission was as
signed to the quarters formerly occupied
by the bookkeeper of the Superintendent
of Streets.
The board will take Immediate steps to
have the walls In the City Hall white
washed and tinted and placed in first
class condition.
The City Attorney will be asked for his
opinion regarding the powers of the board
in the purchase of office furniture. There
is some doubt as to whether the authority
still remains with the Supervisors, as
heretofore.

PHELAN MAY EXPLAIN.
A Banquet at Which Many Mysteries
May Be Dispelled.
Saturday night Mayor Phelan will ban
quet the newly appointed Commissioners
and the heads of all the municipal de
partments, and the affair Is being lookei
forward to with more than ordinary in
terest by these who have been fortunate
enough to receive invitations. By the
Mayor's Intimates it has been quietly
"handed out" that his Honor will un
bosom himself and explain many of the
mysteries of the late campaign and its
resultant fight for the spoils.
It Is said that single-handed and alone
he will tell Just how the Fire Department
deal was worked, how he secured the vot
ing strength of that organization and suc
ceeded In carrying It off without paying
anything more for it than a bunch of
badly broken promises. Also, according
to best Information, he will recite that
pathetic piece entitled "How Gavin Mc-
Nab Become the Original Dead One: or
How I Got to Be the Whole Thing."
The Mayor, it is said, is also going to
explain where the Commissioners are go
ing to get off In case he keeps his prom
ise to give each Assembly district four
positions in the City Hall; and that he
will also divulge where he proposes to
find the seventy-two positions he has
promised.
Altogether, the coming banquet prom
ises to be most Interesting, and It wijl
doubtless make clear many peculiar oc
currences which to-day are understood by
no one save the Mayor himself.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
APPLICANTS FOR
THE OFFICE Of
CHIEF OF POLICE
Only Three Are in the
Field.
ESOLA, HOGAN AND HOLBROOK
In accordance with the resolution
parsed by the new Board of Police Com
missioners at its inaugural meeting last
Monday all applications for the office of
1 Chief of Police had to be sent in to the
secretary of the board by noon yesterday.
Three applications were receivedâ one
from Lieutenant Frederick L. Esola, one
from Detective Robert Hogan and the
third from Charles B. Holbrook, secre
tary of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to, Animals.
Esola arid Hogan had made no secret
of their intention to apply for the posi
tion, and Esola is conceded by the know-
Ing ones to be a cinch. Holbrook's ambi
tion, however, in that direction was not
suspected and has caused genuine sur
prlso. He was on the police force for some
'years and resigned about ten years ago to
accept the position of secretary to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. His chances were generally
discussed yesterday and they were not
considered favorable, but it was thought
he might have "something up his sleeve "
Detective Hogan considers his chances
bright. He Is a man of more than, or
dinary Intelligence and shrewdness, and
has proved that lie is also possessed of an
analytical mind that seldom errs.
Considerable surprise was expressed
that thfre were so few applicants. The
name of ex-Sheriff Whelan had been
freely mentioned, and also two at least
of the captains of police. Since Commis
sioner Jilggy assumed the duties of act
ing Chief in such a vigorous manner It
has been freely remarked that he would
be the next Chief, and the fact that he
did not *cr.d In an application led to many
conjectures. '
The question was generally discussed
around the hall as to whether the Com
missioners are bound by their resolution.
or can they Ignore it and appoint a Chief
outside of the three applicants. Better In
formed people took no stock In the dis
cussion. It Is conceded that the Commis
sioners will keep their pledge to Mayor
Phelan to appoint Esola, and that that Is
all there Is to it.

Resolutions were introduced by Dr. Hop
kins providing that owing to the necessity
for rigid economy- in the Health Depart
ment the chief emergency surgeon be au
thorized to place his twelve assistants on
alternate monthly service, so that six only
will be employed each month. The resolu
tions were adopted.
After the meeting Dr. Williamson stated
that he had had a consultation with Gov
ernor Gage yesterday morning regarding
the discontinuance of the quarantine ser
vice. The Governor stated that he was
not conversant with the questions at Issue
and requested Dr. Williamson to confer
with George A. Knight, the attorney of
the dispossessed board.
MORE APPOINTMENTS BY
NEW BOARD OF HEALTH
POSITION OF CHIEF EMERGENCY
SURGEON CREATED.
Food Inspection Bureau Re-estab
lished With Five Inspectors â No
Conclusion Arrived at Re
garding 1 Quarantine.
The work of creating positions and ap
pointing officials to fill them vrent merrily
on last night at a meeting of the Board of
Health called especially for that purpose.
All the members of the board were pres
ent with the exception of Dr. McCarthy,
and were provided with a typewritten list
of those slated for appointment, so that
the task of filling the positions was per
formed with such exceeding rapidity that
Dr. Williamson, who presided, declarea
one man appointed before the position was
created. The little slip caused a sup
pressed tittering among the spectators,
and Dr. Williamson goodnaturedly joined
in the laugh after the error had been cor
rected.
As was Intimated last Wednesday, the
abolishment of the food inspection bureau
was only temporary, and five food In
spectors were appointed at a salary of $75
a month each. The position of chief food
Inspector was left to be filled at a future
meeting. A new position, to be known as
chief emergency surgeon, was created to
take the place of what was formerly
known as police surgeon. He 1 was al
lowed twelve assistants.

DARK LANTERN METHODS
ADOPTED BY THE MAYOR
Public Barred From Meetings
of the Board.
Programmes Arranged in Secret Sessions,
Where Patronage Is Parceled Out,
to Please the "Pull."
THE affairs of San Francisco are be
ing conducted behind closed doors.
Dark lantern sessions from which
the public Is excluded and in which
the tax-payers are prohibited from
participating are marking the course of
the new administration. In Its anxiety to
let no bit of patronage escape and to deal
out the loaves and llshes according to po
litical pull and not on the test of qualifica
tion or eligibility every act of the new
government has been programmed at
executive sessions where politicians alone
have been allowed to make suggestions or
offer advice.
One of the most alluring ingredients In
the political molasses that Mayor Phelan
spread before the voters with the design
of building big majorities at the last elec
tion was the talk that every citizen of the
city would have a voice in municipal af
fairs when the new charter went into ef
fect and new San Francisco became a
reality. It Is a fact that such is the spirit
of the charter. It is also a fact that the
Mayor and the various commissions ap
pointed by him and under his control have
willfully violated the principle upon which
the new organic law of the city was con
structed.
The open meetings of the commissions
have been nothing more than perfunctory
affairs to ratify the programme of the ex
ecutive sessions.
The only deductions that can be drawn
from the methods adopted are that the
officials participating in the star cham
ber proceedings are doing that of which
they are not proud or that they have been
forced by the power behind the throne
to submit to a programme in violation of
the spirit of the charter and contrary to
public policy.
Pre-election promises bristled with as
sertions that politics and "pull" would
perish with the new order of things The
people had endured both until patience
had ceased to be a virtue and. in the hope
that they would have a voice in the man
agement of the city's affairs, they placed
the men In control who had spread the
most molasses before the ballots were
cast. Now the citizens find that they have
Jumped from the "pull" frying pan into a
redhot political fire.
Some people are unkind enough to say
that San Francisco is the next thing to a
monarchy and that Mr. Phelan is king
Star chamber meetings, dark lantern ses
sions and programme work have added
force to the assertion.
A long time ago there were State lawa
enacted very wisely prohibiting the course
that is being followed by most of Mayor
Phelan's commissions. The possibility of
corruption was so apparent that sections
were Inserted in the codes expressly stat
ing that public bodies must not transact
public business at secret sessions. In con
nection with some of the commissions that
have been meeting behind closed doors the
charter provides that their meetings must
be held in public.
when the new government was being
organized the Supervisors, with Mayor
Phelan as their leaver, were the first to
adopt dark lantern tactics. A member of
that board is authority for the statement
that the Mayor called the members to
gether, presented his programme and bold
ly asserted that it must be carried out.
Fearing that. If his plans were made pub
lic, the programme might not go through,
the edict was issued by mayor Phelan
that the newspaper reporters, who were
kept on. the outside of the meeting place,
should be given a version of the proceed
ings entirely at variance with what had
actur..iy occurred. If the purpose of that
session was to benefit the city. It Is rea
sonable to suppose that the promoters of
It would not have hesitated to take the
public Into their confidence. If. on the
contrary, the motives were questionable,
the course that was adopted is easily ex
plained. :m;;
The Health Board. School Board, Board
of Public "Works. Election Commission
and Civil Service Commission have all
fallen into the secret session habit. Their
appointments have been decided upon and
their official duties performed at meet
ings where politicians have been welcom
ed and the public barred out. The Health
Roard held such a meeting last Tuesday.
The members try to wiggle out of the
iniquity of the procedure by asserting that
the dark lantern affair was only a caucus
and that the public had no right to be
there. Yet it was public business that the
board transacted, and if the members
fully appreciate that they are only the
servants of the people and not the "whole
thing," they might be able to see the
falsity of their position.
The Board of Works is forfeiting public
confidence by following the same tactics,
when the charter emphatically declares
that all of its meetings must be held in
the open. The Election Commission and
Civil Service Commission are keeping the
people In ignorance of their proceedings.
A warm and interesting discussion has
been going on In the School Board over
the appointment of denuties and the fix
ing of salaries, but the public has not
been allowed a voice in the squabble, and
at the meetings where the programmes
have been ratified the subject that savors
of patronage and "pull" has not been
mentioned.
Such methods are destroying confidence
and leave the sincerity of the Mayor and
his men open to serious question.
STORMY SESSION HELD
BY COUNTY COMMITEE
Republicans Astounded by Plan
to Oust Chairman Bouvier.
Zenas U. Dodge Had a Candidate Slated
for the Position, but the Dele
gates Refused to Aid Him.
An animated session of the Republican
Cour.ty Committee took place last night
la Shiels Hall. The attendance was large,
as the members received a hint that
something important would occur. Late
yesterday afternoon each member of the
committee received a communication,- of
which the following Is a copy:
6AN FRANCISCO. Jan. 9. 1&00.
Republican County Cumnltteemaa of the city
and County of tan Francisco â Dear Sir: Alter
ft careful coiis^Ji-ration of the question I have
come to the conclusion that the term of ihe
temporary oCSoen Of the Cour.ty Committee has
*-xplr*d with tlie recent adoption of the by
law*, unij tiiat under the urbanization thus
effected Â± Dew election It in order.
Personally I fec-1 that the beet interests cf
thÂ» orbat.izatlon will l>e subserved by proceed
ing to sucb an flection and have no doubt that
there arc many others of the committee who
ere in accord with me in that respect.
To the t nd. therefore, that all may bÂ« pre
;:iri.-d to a.-t intelligently upon the qaestlon and
r.o < ne taken by surprise I take this means of
Informing the members that at its next regular
rr;<-et:::g I thall bring beiore the committee a
motion to proceed to the election of officers for
the term provided In our new by-laws. Hoping
to find you la attendance, I remain, very re
ei-ectfully. NATHAN H. FRANK.
The meetire was called to order at 8
o'clock. Chairman Bouvier presiding.
After tome preliminary business had been,
transacted George L.. Sharpe of the Thir
t> -eighth District Introduced a resolution
pertaining to the duty of Sheriff Lack
rr.ann. The resolution set forth that some
of Lackrr.ann's predecessors in office had
permitted grievous abuses to exist; that
they had rendered extortionate demands
fur transporting prisoners and patients,
and employed more keepers than neces
eary and recklessly squandered money
which should have been converted into
the treasury. The resolution gave ex
pression to a desire that Mr. Lackmann
should be free from such abuses, ac the
Republican party did not want to be held
responsible, for the misconduct of any of
its officers.
The resolution was not entertained by
the chairman, who ruled it out of order,
but the committee decided to take it up
at the next regular meeting. Nathan 11.
Frank, the author of the letter above
<juoted, then moved that the committee
proceed to the election of officers. He
maintained that the present officers were
selected for temporary duty and that the
positions were not permanent- Consider
able excitement ensued when the motion
was made. There were many spirited con
ferences on the Bide. Zenus U. Dodge was
In the ante-room and the rumor was
quickly circulated that Dodge had a can
didate selected to eucceed Uouvler In the
person of Henry E. Holmes. There were
frequent points or order and counter mo
tions. The chair overruled the points of
order, but entertained a motion to pro
ceed with the election of a chairman.
There were pointed allusions made to
bOBslsm, and the delegates easily Inferred
that Dodge was the man referred to as
the boss. Finally the supporters of Mr.
Frank's motion, fearing that it would not
carry, moved to postpone action, but the
motion was lost by a vote of 23 to 36.
Thereupon Mr. Frank moved to proceed
with the election of a chairman by secret
ballot. That motion was lost by a vote
cf 29 to 33. A. Tluef moved to proceed by
roll call. This motion was carried by a
vote of 33 to 23.
The motion was then adopted to make
the present officers the permanent officers
of the oornmltte*'. which motion prevailed
almost unanimously. In order to clinch
the matter Mr. Ruef moved to reconsider
the vote, and the reconsideration was
lost. During the discussion Chairman
Alfred Bouvier and Secretary James A.
v lison tendered their resignations re
spectively, but the committee refused to
accept them. The following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
The teachers of the School Department have
always rendered to the people of this city effi
cient and meritorious service, yet from time to
time, without right or adequate reason, their
salaries have been either entirely withheld or
largely cut down. There Is now due and there
remains unpaid by the city their salaries for
two whole months within the last two years,
and It Is claimed not only that the amounts so
cue them will never be paid, but also that
they may lose further salary during the next
tÂ«.x months for want of sufficient appropria
tion or apportionment of funds by the muni
cipal authorities. Therefore, be it
Resolved, By this the county committee of the
Republican j*.rty of San Francisco, first, that
euch deprivation, paFt as well aa prospective,
of said salaries is scandalously unjust and ini
quitous. Second, that a committee of three be
appointed by this body to wait upon the Board
Â°l E Â£ ucatlon> upon the Mayor, the Auditor and
the Board of Supervisors and upon any other
necessary municipal officials. an<J In the name
of the Republican party and of this committee
to demand not only the payment to the teach
ers of their back salaries, but also If possible
to obtain a guaranty that no further depri
vation of such salaries shall occur; and to that
end be It
Resolved, That all and any proceedings
necessary in the premises by said committee
are hereby authorized to be taken.
After adjournment the members dis
cussed the meeting, laying particular
stress upon the efforts of Mr. Frank to
secure an election of officers by eecret
ballot. '

MAXWELL ASKS
TIE COURT FOR
REINSTATEMENT
Prays That Gorman
Be Unseated.
PHELAN SHARPLY CRITICISED
ACCUSED OF IGNORING SPIRIT
OF THE CHARTER.
The Mayor Responsible for the Com
missions and This Action Is Cal
culated to Force Him to
Keep His Promise.
George Maxwell, by his attorney, Gar
ret McEnerney, began action yesterday
against the Fire Commissioners for rein
statement as secretary of the Fire De
partment Mr. McEnerney appeared be
fore the Supreme Court In the afternoon
and filed a petition for a writ of mandate,
In which he set forth the provisions of the
charter covering the matter, and the fur
ther fact that Maxwell had been connect
ed for a long time with the department
and that no charges or allegations to his
discredit had ever been made against him.
As was stated in The Call some days
ago, Mr. Maxwell's suit is directed as
much against Mayor Phelan as against
the Fire Commission., His suit, in fact,
Involves more a matter of principle than
the possession of a profitable and prom
inent position, and is intended not po
much to accomplish his own reinstatement
as to force Mayor Phelan to keep an ar.te
election promise, which he gave upon
honor and in good faith.
It is well known that the different com
missions appointed have taken the dicta
tion of the Mayor in the distribution of
their patronage, and that they were ap
pointed a^ter they had made express
promise to that effect. To these promises
the Mayor has held them rigidly, and in
doing so has become responsible for their
every act. The truth is, the Mayor, by a
judicious distribution of the favors with
which the charter endows him, has be
come the whole thing, and an attack upon
one of his commissions is an attack upon
himself.
Mr. Maxwell figured all this when he
filed his petition. In it he sets forth that
the charter provides that no member of
the department may be removed except
for incompetency or neglect of duty, and
that neither charge has ever been brought
against him. Of a consequence, Mr. Mcx
well, Mr. McEnerney and their friends
think It remarkable, to say the least, that
Mayor Phelan should be the first person
to be brought to account for an infrac
tion of one of the Important provisions
incorporated In the city's new scheme of
government. They express surprise that,
in order to accomplish a petty piece of
politics, Mr. Phelan should go so far as
to be In the van of the many who it is
known will seek to break the charter In
order to accomplish similar political
tricks.
Mr. Maxwell's petition prays for the
unseating of Joseph C. Gorman, the
Mayor's choice, and the reinstatement of
himself. The burden of the complaint Is
as follows:
The petitioner Is Informed ana believes,
and therefore alleges, that It Is claimed by
the respondents that they are empowered
under the charter to exalt holders of minor
positions In the department, as It existed
en January S, 1900, at noon, to higher posi
tions In the new department; and also the
right to disrate those holding hither posi
tions In the old department to minor posi
tions In the new, and without trial, an pro
vided In section 2, of chapter II of article
9 of the charter; that It is the bounden
duty of the Board of Fire Commissioners
appointed under the charter to fill the
places in said derailment with the officers
occupying the same or similar places in the
department existing at noon of January 8,
1500. under the provisions of March 28.
herelrabove mentioned.
Wherefore, plaintiff prays for the Issuance
of a writ of mandate directed to, und re
quiring: the respondents, on the receipt
thereof, forthwith to rescind their resolu
tion appointing Joseph C. Gorman the sec
retary of said Board of Tire Commissioners,
and to adopt a resolution appointing the
petitioner to eald place, and to direct the
respondents to admit him to said place and
to iÂ«ermlt him to enter upon the duties
thereof.
The petition was handed to Chief Jus
tice Beatty. but he did not Issue a writ
last evening.

BOER OR BRITON.
WHICH IS RIGHT?
The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have aa communications of general interest.
Editor The Call: Impudence in manner
and impertinence in matter characterize
the efforts of thoÃe pro-British Americans
who attempt the impossible task of de
fending the wolf who at the wrong end of
the stream accuses the lamb below of
muddying the water. According to one of
them, the writer of the "Plea for Eng
land" in your yesterday's issue, the hon
est, honorable and traditional sympathy
which the great mass of the American
people evince for those gallant Boers
bravely defending their hearths and
homes from the wanton Incursion of free
booters and pirates is "sentimental trash,
born of prejudice, envy and ignorance."
I am, notwithstanding, after reading that
"plea," Inclined to think that we who
sympathize with the Boers defending their
own country have as moral and Intelli
gent a basis for that sentiment as have
those who sympathize with the British
invading a country not their own in any
sense 01 the word, and that possibly, we
know as much of the genesis of this war
The trek of 1534 may have been over the
slave question; but let us reverse the case
and suppose that the Dutch had been
seized with a pious spasm against slavery
before It struck the vitals of the British
and had Issued a peremptory demand that
all slaves held by the British should be
freed, and this without adequate financial
compensation. What would have hap
pened? The British would have told the
Dutch to mind their own ten command
ments.
But the British found grace first, and
the British . conscience cannot stand the
sins of its neighbors, and therefore the
trek of 1534. And therefore the trek of
1843. and therefore the trek and blood
shed of ISIS; and therefore the war
and forcible annexation of the Transvaal
In 1877, and the war of 18S0-Sl, when the
righteous British were handily whipped,
and therefore the Jameson raid of 1895,
when 400 of the sinful, vulgar Boer farm
ers, with only small arms, whipped nearly
twice that number of the pious raiders
armed with Lee-Metfords and quick-firing
Maxims; and therefore finally and lastly
the present righteous Chamberlain annex
of the Jameson raid, and all because (one
reason is as good as another for the wolf)
those bad, bad Boers would not give up
their slaves in 1534. There are to-day two
kinds of patriots who will be found on two
kinds of sideÃ.
The first, like the gallant Otis of Los
Angeles, will be found defending his
home and country by going thousands of
miles away to attack with fire and sword
those of other and weaker men.
This stripe of "patriot" are by natural
affinity pro-British , and think the South
African veldt is the natural place for "the
absent-minded beggars" from Cockney
land to be, defending the "cottage 'omes
of England."

THE OPEN DOOR TO CHINA.
ATISFACPORY assurances have been received
by the State Department from Great Britain,
France, Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan that
in all parts of China which may in any way come
within the sphere of influence of any of them all
rights aeretotore granted to this Government by the
Chinese Government shall remain unimpaired. That
means the preservation of the "open door" for our
commerce with China and is rightly regarded as one
of the notable diplomatic triumphs of the administra
tion.
It is stated that these assurances are not yet ex
pressed in writing, as none of the great powers was
willing to express the agreement in that way unless
given guarantees that the others would do so, and up
to this time that has not been done. It appears,
however, the State Department is well satisfied with
the situation. There is no reason to doubt the good
faith 'of any of the Governments concerned, and it
may be accepted as settled, for the present at any
rate, that no European Government is going to inter
fere with the utmost expansion of our trade in the
parts of China over which it exercises control.
The United States has never sought for any dis
tinctive "sphere of influence" in China. What has
been gained by the State Department, therefore, is all
that we have ever asked or desired. We have no wish
to take part in the dismemberment of China, nor
would our people be willing to accept a share of the
spoils if it be dismembered. All that we have asked
for is a right of trade equal to that of the most fa
vored nation, and that we have obtained by the as
surances now given.
Since the State Department has secured our com
mercial rights in this way, it remains for Congress to
enact legislation which will enable us to turn them
to advantage. It will profit our merchants and our
manufacturers little to have an open door awaiting
them in China if they have not the means of reach
ing the door on equal terms with foreigners. It will
require ships to carry our products to the Orient, and
we must provide them. Russia is rapidly opening a
railway communication with China, and Great Brit
ain, Germany and France have subsidized steamship
lines competing for her trade. In the face of that
competition our right to trade with the Chinese will
not profit us much without such legislation as will
promoteUhe upbuilding of our merchant marine.
If th/ course of trade were determined by geo
graphical relations the Chinese trade in foreign goods
would be almost wholly ours, for we are her natural
commercial neighbors. In this, however, as in other
things, human energy and 6agacity can overcome
difficulties of adverse situation. If European nations
sid their merchants in obtaining the trade of China
while our Government remains in the future as supine
as it has been in the past, they will get the bulk of the
trade and we shall continue to see California goods
shipped to Liverpool and from there to China to be
told with a larger profit for the British middleman
than for the California producer. The logical result
of the Hay negotiations is therefore the shipping
bill. Without that the open door will be hardly more
than a diplomatic rainbow.

TREASURY DEPOSITS.
SECRETARY GAGE in his reply to the in
quiries of the House of Representatives con
cerning the deposits of public money in certain
national banks has made a complete vindication of
himself from any charges or suspicions that may have
been directed against him. He has not, however,
offered any adequate defense of the policy of making
such deposits.
The Secretary states: "The reason for utilizing
national banks as depositories for public money, as
authorized by law when the receipts of the treasury
were exceeding its expenditures, has been to avoid
the disturbance to business which the withdrawal of
large sums of money from active circulation to the
treasury vaults must inevitably cause. The policy
thus pursued by me has been the established policy of
the Government for many years, and a departure
frcm it under similar conditions would certainly
cause disastrous results."
It is true the system has been long followed by the
Government, but it has been the cause of scandals
under every administration since the practice began.
At the present time the Democratic party is assailing
a Republican administration for favoritism in making
deposits, while four years ago the Republican party
was assailing Secretary Carlisle under a Democratic
administration upon similar grounds. The evils of
the system are so plain that they need only be stated
to be understood. In the first place, when interest
rates range from 6 to 12 per cent it is manifestly un
fair for the Government to lend sums of money
amounting to many millions of dollars to certain
banks without interest. The practice does indeed put
the money in that way into circulation, but as banks
and speculators are thus induced to do business on
the Government money, it becomes dangerous for the
Government to withdraw the deposits when they are
needed. Thus a double evil is worked by the policy,
first in advancing public money to certain banks with
out interest, and second by the injury done to the
financial situation when the money is withdrawn.
Secretary Windom directed attention to the evils
of the system in his report of 1889, in the course of
which he said:
It necessarily Involves temptation to favoritism of
the most objectionable character.
It makes the treasury more or less dependent upon
the banks, on account of the difficult and delicate task
of withdrawing the deposits when wanted without cre
ating serious disturbance of financial conditions.
It Involves the exercise of a most dangerous power
by the Secretary of the Treasury, whereby he may,
if so disposed, expand or contract the currency at will,
and In the interest of certain favorites whom/ he may
select.
It is grossly unjust to the Government to grant the
free use of its money, while It pays to the very par
ties thus favored 4 and 4Vfc per cent interest on its own
bonds which are pledged as security for the money thus
received.
It is to the credit of American officials that no
Secretary of the Treasury has ever been convicted
of making a personal profit out of the money thus
advanced to the banks. It is none the less true, how
ever, that these deposits nearly always have been ad
vanced to banks of the same political faith as the Sec
retary of the Treasury at the time. Thus, while there
has been no personal wrong, there is always a politi
cal scandal, and will be as long as, the system is main
tained. <
It is time Congress take steps to remedy the evil.
It ought not to be difficult to devise some better man
ner in handling public money.

WOMEN who never before have wished to hold

The cause of this agitation in the feminine ranks is
a bill recently introduced by Senator Hoar. It bears
the pleasing title of a bill for the protection of song
birds, and is therefore calculated to win the support
of the ladies, for they are ever ready to uphold any
law which protects the pretty birds, the sweet singers
of the air, from the wanton destruction of cruel men.
The title, however, is deceptive. It is aimed not at

ROOSEVELT ON TRUSTS.
GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT of New York has
joined the mighty host of those who in these
days are denouncing trusts and clamoring for
their suppression. In the report of his annual message
he is quoted assaying: "That abuses exist, and that they
are of a very grave character, it is worse than idle to
deny. Just so long as in the business world unscru
pulous cunning is allowed the free rein which, thanks
tc the growth of humanity during the past centuries,
we now deny to unscrupulous physical force, then
just so long there will be a field for the best effort
of every honest social and civic reformer who is ca
pable of feeling an impulse of generous indignation
and who is far-sighted enough to appreciate where the
real danger to the country lies."
There will be no question of the excellence of that
wisdom. It has, however, the defect of being a repi
tition of what has been said and heard, written and
read, many times. What is desired now is some clear
statement of the wrongs done by trusts, so that the
people may be able to distinguish wherein those com
binations are good and wherein they are evil. When
the injuries inflicted have been accurately defined it
will then be possible to provide something in the way
of a remedy, but there is no profit to anybody in
vague denunciations.
Governor Roosevelt is an advocate of the strenuous
life, and therefore it is not too much to ask of him
that he strain himself a little and grapple with the
problem like a statesman. Having one Bryan to lift
up a roaring voice of general condemnation, we do
not need another voice to assist him. It is safe to
say the people are perfectly willing to support any
well directed legislation designed to put an end to
evils the trusts produce, but they are still waiting to
hear what are the evils and what is the remedy. The
issue offers an opportunity for distinction to the true
reformer, but it will yield no more honor to "Rough
Riders" than it will to "spread-eagle" orators.

A BOER VIEW.
THERE has been recently published in London
an ante-war letter from a member of the Trans
vaal Volksraad- written last summer, which dis
proved Mr. Chamberlain's claim that the : Boers
wanted to bring on war to enable them to dominate
South Africa. The writer blames Rhodes for the
situation. Great sums' of English money have been
sunk in the non-productive mines of Rhodesia.
Rhodes sought to secure in the Cape Colony elections
a majority favorable to incorporating Rhodesia with
that colony in order to divert the English public
from its mining losses, and perhaps squeeze more
money out of new investors.
Faiiing in the elections, it is charged that he de
liberately conspired with Chamberlain to force the
Transvaal into war to re-establish his reputation by
adding a rich mining province to the empire.
This Boer letter contrasts the - mining laws of
Rhodesia with those of the Transvaal. In the former
a heavy mining license is required, and 50 per cent of
the gold taken out must be paid to Government as
a royalty. No one can own ground, but must hold
it as a tenant. The superior advantages offered to
laboring men in the Transvaal is seen in the more lib
eral laws. Any one can take a mining claim 150 by
400 feet for a payment of 2s 6d a month, or 62 cents,
and one man may take as many claims as he likes for
that payment on each, and his tax is 5 per cent of the
output. The great influx of miners made necessary
more of the machinery of government This member
of the Volksraad admits that the laws are not all per
fect, but he invites comparison with the laws of any
other country, asking his correspondent to cite to him
any country in which all the people subscribe to the
perfection of the laws under which they live. If other
nations have perfect government why is it that in all
of them, including England and the United States,
there are reform parties which have a place in politics
and command millions of followers, on the theory
that the government can be made better by reforming
its laws?
We are inclined to think that this shrewd Boer has
put to the so-called superior nations and the great
powers a question that will rest upon the conscience
of their people. They are in the habit of claiming
the right to go abroad to establish by force ideal
government for others when the very existence of re
form parties in the midst of them is proof that they
have no such government at home. He says: "We
have already conceded much, and we would even go
farther and. give all that can be fairly asked, but we
are still threatened and forced, and, feeling that noth
ing will satisfy unless we give of our independence,
we will concede no more. We will steadily proceed
upon our own initiative and grant such reforms as
may be necessary, but we are not going to give our
honor and our country' away, let come what may.
The British public has been blinded by men who will ',
send others to be butchered, while they gloat from,
afar over the misery they will cause. If we fight â it
is for our homes and our independence. What will
Chamberlain and Rhodes be fighting for?"
The war, not begun when this letter was written,
is now far on, and up to this time the unwilling party
to it has proved that when men are defending their
homes it is a mistake to attack them with contempt
of their reasons and their courage.

men who kill birds, but at women who wear their
feathers. There is nothing in it which forbids the
killing of birds, but everything to prevent the selling
of the feathers for brnamental purposes. .
In the first clause the bill declares "that the impor
tation into the United States of birds, feathers, or
parts of birds for ornamental purposes, or for any
purpose except food, be and the same is prohibited."
An exception is made of importations for museums,
or for zoological gardens, etc., and the Secretary of
the Treasury is authorized to make regulations for
the admission. of birds or feathers for such objects.
The second clause declares: "That the transportation
of birds, feathers or parts of birds, to be used or sold,
except such as are excepted in the first section of this
act, from any State or Territory of the United States
to or through any other State or Territory of the
United States, is hereby prohibited. Whoever shall
violate tJ ie provisions of this section shall, upon con
viction in the -district where the offense shall have
been committed, be punished for each such offense by
a fine .of fifty dollars."
It will be seen that the bill not only excludes the
importation of the rare plumage of the beautiful birds
of tropic lands, but prohibits interstate commerce in
ornamental feathers as well. Should the bill go into
effect it will no longer be permissible to send the
feather of the Oregon gray goose to decorate the hat
of the California belle. The issue is going to be one
of fuss and feathers in earnest, and there is not a
single woman in the Senate to stand up and support
the right of the feather-hatted sex to sport their
feathers. There has been started a movement to ob
tain for women seats in the stores, and It is a good
movement, but what women need most at this time
are seats in the Senate.

WAITED FOR MEN OF
THE HOSPITAL CORPS
WHAT DELAYED THE SAILING
OF THE TARTAR.
A Detachment of Thirty Lost on the
Way Out Here â Knotty Prob
lem for the Quartermaster.
The Tartar sailed yesterday morning
after waiting over night for some men
of the hospital corps on their way from
the East. They were regularly lost.
Nothing was heard of them on this side
of the continent after they left New York,
and when the sailing time of the Tartar
came they were anywhere between here
and the Atlantic Ocean.
Colonel Forwood, chief medical officer
of this department, had been trying for
some days to obtain definite information
of the men's whereabouts. He finally en
listed the services of the railroad com
pany. Wednesday evening the railroad
officials located the men somewhere this
side of Ogden and they arrived at the
Oakland mole Thursday night. They
came over on the first boat yesterday
morning and before noon were all aboard
the transport and she was on her way
to Manila. There were thirty privates
and a steward in the party. They were
in two wrecks on the way out, but no
one was injured, and beyond that the trip
was uneventful.
The annual inspection of the Presidio
by the department inspector will begin
to-day. It will take some time, for, be
sides the buildings and stores at the post,
the men and their clothing, all battery
and troop property and the means of car
ing for it, the drills, mounted and dis
mounted, and, last of all, the money ac
counts will have to be gone over. The
Inspector will also have to go over the
horses and mules now at the post and
in the charge of the quartermaster, be
sides the stables and the feed storehouses.
There Is a great deal of property that
will have to be condemned and this, too,
will have to pass under the eyes of the
inspector.
The quartermaster's department at the
Presidio is busying Itself in trying to find
out Â¦ Just what has become of about 500
cubic yards of the Inner parade ground.
During the storm the drain that runs un
der It choked up and the water gathered
deep in the ravine above. Then the water
commenced suddenly to subside and
when It had all, or nearly all, disappeared
a large hole, twenty feet round at the
surface and nearly thirty feet deep, ap
peared in the middle of the parade ground
with two other smaller ones close to It.
There was no evidence of the transfer
of earth at the mouth of the drain be
low the parade ground, and the question
the quartermaster's department is figur
ing on is, where are those hundreds of
tons of earth?

JACOBS DEFENDS PETITION.
Declares It Does Not Commit Fruit
Canners to Support of Recip
rocity Treaties.
Isidor Jacobs, who has obtained the sig
natures of all the fruit canners and deal
ers In fruit in San Francisco to a petition
asking Commissioner Kasson to consider
California in negotiating reciprocity
treaties In the future, denies emphatically
that the petition practically sanctions re
ciprocity. It merely asks, he says, that
the interests of California be taken into
consideration in the event that other re
ciprocity treaties should be negotiated. If
no more such treaties are negotiated, says
Mr. Jacobs, the petition can do no harm,
while if they should be projected the rep
resentations made by the fruit canners of
the State might be favorably considered.
MAIL STEAMER
DID NOT STOP
AT HONOLULU
MoanaCame Through
From Samoa.
PLAGUE* SCARE CONTINUES
The Australian mall steamer Moana
arrived In port unexpectedly yesterday
morning. She was not looked for until
to-day, but owing to the plague she
came on without entering the harbor at
Honolulu, bringing the passengers for
that place on here.
When the Moana arrived off Honolulu
the quarantine officer. Custom-house of
ficer, a pilot and the agent of the ship
went out to her in a tug. The quaran
tine doctor reported that there had been
three deaths in Honolulu from what wa3
supposed to be the plague, making eight
een deaths in all. He asked Captain
Carey if he wanted to enter' his ship and
take the chances of quarantine at San
Francisco. The captain decided to come
on for this port. The Hawaiian officials
did not leave their tug, no mail nor
papers were put aboard, so there is no
means of learning what is being done in
the islands.
The Hawaiian quarantine officer told
Purser Hodson of the Moana that every
precaution was being taken. Houses in
which anybody had died were burned
down; sewers were being cleaned; all
parts of Chinatown were being disin
fected and everything being done that
Ingenuity could suggest to stop the
spread of the disease.
The cabin passengers for Honolulu who
were brought up on the Moana were Mrs.
Brenham and son and Mr. and Mrs. A. G.
Reynolds. Besides these there were five
steerage passengers who were returning
to the paradise of the Pacific.
The full list of cabin passengers on the
mall boat is:
From Sydney. N. S. W.â Charles Kennlnjr
haus. Miss Helen Merrill, Mr. and Mrs. H. H.

Â¦the Moana met with some heavy
weather during the run across. On De
cember 29 a strong gale was blowing, and
during its continuance James Mclnnes,
bathroom steward, was missed. The ship
was searched from stem to Btern, but no
trace of the unfortunate fellow could be
found. The supposition is that he fell
overboard.
The officers of the Moana cpuld give no
additional information about the wrecked

llncatlon. He then claimed a protective
tariff was unconstitutional and asserted
the right of each State to lay, as it were,
a preliminary injunction on the enforce
ment of any law it feels to be contrary
to the Federal compact. After the Mexi
can war came the closing days of the
statesman, when he despaired of his
country. To him was coming the force
of the saying that a house divided against
itself cannot stand, and he foresaw that
the Union could not endure half-slave and
half-free. Yet he loved the Union, and
the man whose logical political .philoso
phy had taught the South how to secede
wrote his last speech, which hiÃ strength
would "not permit him to read, on the
theme, "How Can the Union Be Pre
served?" His only solution was that the
North must agree "to do Justice by con
ceding to the South an equal tight in the
conquered territory, and to do her duty
by causing the stipulations relative to
fugitive slaves to befaithfuly fulfilled, to.
cease the agitation of the slave question
and provide for the insertion of a provi
sion in the constitution by an amendment
which will restore in substance the power
she was possessed of protecting herself
before the equilibrium between the sec
tions was destroyed by the action of this
Government." He feels that the case is
hopeless, and he states that be is strug
gling to save "the Union, If it can be
done, and, if it cannot, to save the section
where it has pleased Providence to cast
my lot, and which I sincerely believe has
justice and the constitution on its tide.
Having faithfully done my duty to the
best of my ability â¢ â¢ â¢ I shall have
the consolation, let what will come, that
I am free from all responsibility," and
with those helpless words on his lips John
C. Calhoun left the political arena and
went to his deathbed. He was striving
for a cause that was already on the way
to be a lost one. -
Of incorruptible integrity, of wonder
ful powers of argument, of sincere de
votion to Christianity, of marvelous sin
gleness of purpose and power of influenc
ing men, Calhoun stands out as one of
the most noteworthy characters In
American history. He was born of
Scotch-Irish parents in Western South
Carolina in 1782 and died at Washington
in ISSO, while serving as one of the United
States Senators from his native State.
Curiously enough, his wholo academic
training was in Connecticut,' from the
straitest sect of the Federalists. He
took his bachelor's degree from Yale
College in 1804, when the elder Dwight
was president, and at a time when one
of the professors had recently been
obliged to sever his connection with the
institution largely because he was a Re
publican. The subject of his commence
ment oration was "The Qualification Nec
essary to Constitute a Perfect States
man." and his purpose for life work led
him to the law, that great avenue to pol
itics in the United States. He studied at
the famous Litchfield Law School under
Judges Reeve and Gould, and then re
turned to his home in Abbeville District
and began to practice his profession. His
political abilities were soon discovered,
and he was chosen a member of the State
Legislature. There he achieved promi
nence and was soon transferred to the
national councils, being elected to Con
gress In the year 1810. Probably there has
never been a case when an unknown
young man leaped at a bound Into na
tional prominence as did Calhoun. His
first appearance In Congress was in No
vember, 1811. Struck with his abilities.
Clay, the Speaker, placed him second on
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. For
eign affairs was a complicated skein. The
long series of outrages on our commerce
from Great Britain and France could no
longer be borne. We must have redress
by peaceable or forcible means.
Neither nation could show a clean rec
ord of dealing toward us, but we could
not contend with both at one time. We
must choose one antagonist and fight
her. England had been much more
troublesome to our commerce because
she had more power at sea, and the lead-
Ing spirits among that band of young
men in Congress who were shaping the
policy of the Republican majority hailed
from the South and West, where by old
tradition France was loved and Britain
hated. Therefore, war with England was
resolved.
The tone of the first resolutions the new
committee reported was bellicose and
stated that "to wrongs so dartng in their
character and so disgraceful In their exe
cution it is impossible that the people of
the United States should remain lnutffer-

LOS ANGELES, Jan. ll.i-The routing
imbroglio between the Southern Pacific
and the Santa Fe has brought to ,the sur
face the fact that a pooling arrangement
exists between those lines on a basis that
each line obtains 50 per cent of the freight
earned for transportation. Local shippers
Insist that they have seen the official
documents. The failure of the roads to
XRtet the local commercial organizations
in conference and adjust differences will
result in bringing this pool arrangement
before the Interstate Commerce Commis
sloners, who will hold a session in Los
Angeles In a few weeks. Lawyers are
working on the case and the evidence is
overwhelmingly against the roads.
In extenuation for the position taken by
the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific in the
matter of routing the roads declare they
are not responsible for the new rule which
went Into effect January 1. The trans
continental freight bureau is said to have
Issued the order and It bears the official
Indorsement of the following roads:
AtKhison, Topeka and Santa Fe, Burling
ton 1 and Missouri River, Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific, Denver and Rio

The fallura of Huntlngton to reply to
the citizens' committee arises from the
fact that he Is at Newport News, Va.,
where his shipyards are located, and that
he has met a committee from Congress,
which has examined his holdings. He
further says that his change of heart in
favoring the Nicaragua canal arises from
an attempt to court the favor of the de
partment executive that he may dispose
of his shipyard on the coast.

XUXâ JOHN CALDWELL CAL
HOUN.
Calhoun dominated South Carolina as
no other man has ever dominated one cf
the United States. Quite fitly his lofty
statue towers above Madison square in
Charleston, and his grave In St. Philip's
Cemetery Is one of the first sights shown
to strangers. The impress of his strong,
masterful personality was stamped thor
oughly on the thought of the Palmetto
State. The people drank deeply from the
fountains of his political philosophy and
are intellectual followers of Calhoun un
til this day. It was a deserved reward.
No nlan ever lived more thoroughly for a
State than did Calhoun. He was a lover
of the nation, but far more of South Car
olina. For her profit and honor he la
bored and struggled, and her good was al
ways before his eyes. Calhoun's political
life may be divided into parts in which he
shows himself, respectively, a nattonail-
Ist, a nullifler and one who despaired of
the Union. When he entered Congress
he enrolled himself In that enthusiastic
and ardent group of men known as the
young Republicans, who drove on a re
luctant administration into a war with
Great Britain for the nation's honor, and
who stood for a protective tariff, a United
States bank and a strong government.
After Jackson's election as President we
find Calhoun appearing as the archpriest
of an anti-national doctrine, that of ntil-
Johns Hopkins University:
ent. â¢ â¢ â¢ The period has arrived when)
' * It is the sacred duty of Congress
to call forth the patriotism and the re
sources of the country." In his first
speech, uttered only a month after hla
lirst appearance In Washington, Calhoun,
with clear and forcible phrases, defended
this report. He openly avowed that "tha
committee recommended the measures
now before the House as a preparation
for war.'" and maintained that the na
tional honor and the safety of the citi
zens' lives and property demanded the use
of force. The efforts of Clay. Calhoun
and the other young Republicans forced
a declaration of war. and Calhoun was
one of the main supporters of the war in
Congress. He differed from the majority,
however, in favoring the repeal of all the
restrictive acts of non-importation and
embargo. He felt that "we are a people
essentially active. â¢ â¢ â¢ No passive sys
tem can suit such a people, in action supe
rior to all others, in patient endurance In
ferior to none. Nor does it suit the genius
of our Government Our Government is
founded en freedom and hates coercion.
To make the restrictive system effective
requries the most arbitrary laws."
After the war we find Calhoun. now rec
ognized as a leader in the House, defend
ing the treaty-making power from as
saults by other Republicans and Introduc
ing measures for the establishment of a
United States bank. He did not discuss
the constitutional question, but, accept
ing the validity of the power to charter a
bank as an established fact, he made an
exhaustive argument to the point that
such a "bank would be favorable to the
administration of the finances of the Gov
ernment."
With other such sentiments he closed
his career tn the House of Representa
tives and became
Monroe's Secretary
of War in ISI7. Ma
found the admin
istration of that de
. par tment chaotic.
Pk He reduced it 3

u/riW Ix \ 1! -? constantly away
t ill Â» from the President
'/It and from such old
'P associates as Clay
/ and coming mora
and more to a
strict constructl o n
of the constitution.
So in the election of
IS2S we find him on
the Jac kson 1 a n
ticket and note that he was re
elected by a great majority as Vice
President. Doubtless he hoped to ba
Jackson's political heir; doubtless he was
the natural leader of the new Democratic)
party after Jackson, and doubtless per
sonal matters, such as the unreasonable
grudge which Jackson bore to the man
who supported a Just censure on some
of Jackson's early acts and who would
not receive Jackson's friends as his, were
potent causes in destroying his hope ot
having Jackson's assistance, which aid
was transferred to Van Buren. But that
such considerations, and the fact that ha
found that popularity In South Carolina
would follow most easily an anti-national
attitude were the chief motives of Cal
houn's new position, cannot be believed.
That these influences were not without
their effect is undoubted, but the change
in front of so keen and conscientious a
thinker as Calhoun cannot be explained
by such Influences alone. In the twelve
or fifteen years since he had left Con
gress he had undergone one of those sub
tle and gradual changes of feeling which
often lead men to conclusions diametri
cally opposite to those with which they
began. That his two positions were In
consistent may be granted easily, but in
consistency is often another name for
growth. The maintenance of slavery and
of the plantation system of his State be
came so Important in his eyes that all
else sank into a secondary place, and un
consciously to himself his point of view
had changed from a national to a sec
tional one. x
Calhoun admitted that a State had no
right to oppose the execution of an admit
tedly constitutional law. but the State
was the Judge as to whether she would
admit the constitutionality of the law. If
the law was of doubtful constitutionality
or clearly unconstitutional â and the test
in both cases lay in the hands of the State
â It might be declared null and void by the
State as far as It was concerned, and
thenceforth 'should not be enforced in its
limits. There was no secession, the State
was exercising a reserved power. It still
remained In the Union, and if three
fourths of the States wÂ»hould decide
against Its position when iff peal was made
to them by Congress the State must yield
to the voice of its sisters and the disputed
power now became an undisputed part of
the constitution.
We have left ourselves no time to tell
how Calhoun resigned the position of Vice
President and accepted that of United
States Senator to defend South Carolina"a
position in nullifying the tariff act. or how
by stpeeches, addresses from his home at
Fort Hill and letters to Governor Hamil
ton he confirmed the wills of the people.
It Is true Clay's compromise tariff and
Jackson's firm attitude In favor of tha
preservation of the Union deferred a con
flict for thirty years and that Calhoun
and his State gradually came back Into
national politics as extreme members of
the State's rights and pro-slavery wing oC
the Democratic party. Ills long service in
the Senate enabled him to take a bold and
decided stand against the United States
Bank and in favor of the sub-treasury
bill, and to make vigorous contention for
the annexation of Texas and the addition
of the new slave Territory. In the Texas
matter his influence was also exerted in
the Tyler Cabinet, where he held the office
of Secretary of State for a time. Goln?
back to the Senate he fought any further
compromise. Then came the end. His
work was built on the sand of State". â¢Â»
rights and slavery, and fall in the great
storm of the Civil War. He has left be-,
hind him the name of the "keenest politi
cal logician the United States has ever
had," and of the "greatest and purest of
pro-slavery fanatics." as an unfriendly
foreign biographer called him. A fairer
tribute, given by one of the ablest of tha
historians of his own section is: "I at
least cannot call him a thoroughly wise
and great statesman, but I can admlra
his strong, subtle Intellect and lofty in
tegrity and soundness of heart. Mistaken
he was often, but he never did anything
consciously that he thought wa3 wrong or
low.

New York Stock Market.
NTTW YORK. Jan. 11.â To-day's stock mar
ket was characterized by considerable epecu
lative activity on the part cf the tear con
tingent. The raid, however, was restricted to
a email nun.ber of stocks, all of them in the
list cf what are called speciaJties. including
the New York City public utilities and the
older high-priced Industrials. There was posi
tive demoralization in these active stocks in
contrast to the fairly firm undertone of the
general list and eÂ»^pecially the railroads. The
occasion of the attack en the industrials wits,
of court*, yesterday's utterances by the presi
dent of the American Sugar Refining Company.
The friends of other Blocks in the Industrial
list made strenuous effor'ji to differentiate thtir
movement from â¢:..= : of sugar and marked them
up briskly at the c-i>enlng in face of the vio
lent break in the 1 rice of the stock named,
but the bears met this maneuver with selling
In such volume and with such confidence that
one after another of the specialties crumbled
In price ani fell through a storm of dislodged

tic^artment were generally wiped out. The
only prominent railroad stock In which the net
declines reached & point were Baltimore and
Ohio, Burlington, Missouri Pacific, Pennsyl
vania and Delaware and Hudson. I.ackan arm.i
OecUaed 2 points. The rally before the close
reduced all net declines in the railroad to
fractional limits and registered fractional gains
la Borne caa?s. The course of Sugar was ex
tremely erratic and feverish all day. At the
low level it was over 6 points below laet night
and 1 . below the low level In the December
panic. Its net lorn is 6. All of the New York
traction and lighting tnaret were severe euf
lerers, Metroj>olitÂ«n showing an extreme de
cline of S 1 *, Brooklyn Transit ti and Thlrd-
Aver.ue C l^ The Gas stocks, Manhattan, Peo
ple's Gas, Tobacco, Federal Steel. Sugar pre-
Irrrfd ar.d Tennessee Coal were off from 'A to
4 1 j. The borrowing demand for Sugar sent it
to a prc-miura in the loan crowd before the
Close. A large preponderance of the total deal-
Ings was made up by this group of specialties.
At no ievol of prices m there any activity

CHICAGO, Jan. 11.â Liverpool administered a
snub to the local wheat market to-day, show
ing an advance, although there was a loss here
yesterday. Not further to offend her best cus
tomers, first prices In the pit here were a shade
over yesterday's close. May at 67%ff67TÂ»c. The
market was not a broad one and fluctuations
were narrow the greater part of the time. There
was a fair demand early, and as offerings were
not larce the market rallied to 6S%(g6SVi. O:i
eflllnc against calls this was lost. May reced
ing to 67'Â»567%c. The strength of provisions
had a steadying effect. The strength. of corn
was also an Influence. Excepting some activity
at the opening the session v/as dull. There was
no Improvement in the cash demand nor In the
demand for export. Cash bids were up Me, but
business, which otherwise might have been
done, was shut off by a lack of cars. Shorts
covered near the end of the session, probably
influenced as much as anything by uneasiness
over the South African situation. May closed
firm. %@Vic over yesterday, at 68c.
Corn showed a little more activity than has
been the rule recently. Support came from the
strength of provisions and thÂ« small country
offerings which Influenced most of the buying.
May closed Vie higher than yesterday.
Oats were firm In sympathy with corn and
provisions. May closed unchanged from yes
terdny.
Provisions were strong and active the greater
part of the session, prices again touching the
hteh mark established laÂ«t week. Interests
which sold out in the hope of a greater break
Joined with uhorts In buying. There wan also
a good outside demand. The strength was
based on hog receipts under expectations and
better prices at the yards and cognizance of the
fact that deliveries on January contracts are
Btlll very small. May pork closed 12% c over
yesterday. May lard 12% c up and May ribs
10c up.

! vertlwr's London financial cablegram says:
! Stocks were still stagnant here to-day, but
' the' tone was firm. The action of the Bank of
i England in reducing its minimum discount rate
I to 5 i-er cent and the sequel of the reduction
â¢ of the French rate to 4 per cent, encouraged
| some Continental buying of Tlntos and Span
i lrh fours, but neither London nor Berlin ehow
i ed any revival of speculation.
j Americans were neglected, except for Balti-
I more and Ohio necuritles. which were bought
on the encouraging earnings statement.
Indian Currency Commission "ear-marked"
Â£100.000 more cold and Â£94,000 were engaged
for the Argentine republic. The bank bought
! Â£31.0u0 in eagles. The tendency in the open
I market was toward harder prices for gold be
cause of information that the Indian Council
I was obtaining a higher rate than usual for tel-

an ostrich or is blessed with a superabundance
of what the superstitious term "good luck." He
ate a few- days -ago a score of biscuits "like
mother used to build," and, although they were acciden
tally flavored with a powerful liquid used for gargling
the loading lady's throat, he lives to tell the story and
consume more of the same. V'.;--7
Bryson is a member of the Elinore Sisters company,
which is now entertaining audiences at the Orpheum with
a laughable skit entitled "Dangerous Mrs. Dclaney." He
is playing a thinking and eating part, and has scored a
hit in both lines. His appetite for the provokers of in
digestion Is a marvel to his beholders. Dyspeptic bene
dicts gaze with awe ns he rapidly swallows the biscuits,
and lament the fact that they cannot please their wives
by eating the leaden fac similes displayed temptingly on
their breakfast tables.
Wednesday afternoon last Bryson nearly succumbed.
His fortitude under the conditions entitles him to ( be
classed as a stoic. The biscuits at the matinee had a
peculiar taste to him and. In a whisper aside, he asked
"Mrs. Delaney" whether they were properly "doped" with

LAST DAYS
OF FOUGERE
I have not heard many opinions ex
pressed of Fougere, but judging from the
determined applause she incites at the
Orpheum It would appear that she has
caught on. She should. Whatever may
be said of her frank Frenchness, whatever
may be said of her voice, she is still the
brightest star on the bill and she. Is to
take her leavo after the present week.
No one quite as artistic has Visited us in
a long time. In her own way, Fougere Is
one of tho big people of stageland and
should be experienced by every one who
makes it a business to go and take the
children to see the best artists of the en
tertainment world.
Fougere is tho best we are likely to see
In the chanteuse line for a long time,
though perhaps, on second thought, It
might be wiser for the persons who make
a practice of seeing the best of everything
to leave the children at home In this case.
Fougere Is not edifying to youth, but she
is all I have said she is and a good deal
moro It Is quite Impossible to say. How
ever amiable one may be to Americans,
Foucere does things that Americans do,
but does them in so different a way that
wo simply have to acknowledge her orig
inality. She does things also that Ameri
cans cannot do and perhaps a few things
that they would not care to, but what
ever she does, there is always In It the
fascinating personal quality that wins
every time.
I might say a few more things of this
exceedingly clever person, for she Is a
â¢jmptlng subject, but there are others at
the Orpneum deserving of attention, and
I have given this much time and space to
her because there are only a few remain
ing opportunities in which to see her, and
1 may persuade some one that it is worth
while.
One word more. This week Fougere Is
sinking "I'll Leave My Happy Home for
You," which last week was Dorothy
Drew's best bit, and the difference in her
conceptionâ a decidedly French concep
tionâis peculiarly interesting.
Dorothy Drew, who. by the way. Is so
different in appearance this week as to
be hardly recognizable, sings and dances
with characteristic cleverness and Is as
popular as she can possibly desire to be.
John Thorn Is several degrees more amus
ing than he was on his first appearance,
which is saying a good deal. I am giving
the newcomers second place, but some of
them are too good to be neglected. Tho
Elinore Sisters appear in a Fklt which
gives the cleverer one a great opportunity
to do some very original grotesque work.
She Isln appearance, voice and manner
us broadly humorous as any one that has
been here In years, and certainly more bo
than any other of her sex. Frank La
tona does a varied turn as a musical
tramp and creates a very great stir In
deed by playing "The Holy -City" a3
loudly as possible on a slide trombone.

CLAIMS HIS LEGACY
OAKLAND. Jan. 11.â Graham Akerly
has finally concluded to return to thÂ«
scenes of his boyhood and draw down
$397 55 on deposit with the county treas

mother, the late Catherine M. Akerly.
Judge Hall to-day issued an order direct
ing the County Treasurer to pay Akerty
the money. Graham Akerly Is a son of
the late Rev. Benjamin Akerly. About the
time his mother died he left Oakland sud
denly, and when next he-^rd from he had
enlisted in the army. It was thereafter
supposed he was killed in the war in
Cuba. Some time ago, however, Akerly
was located in San Francisco, but refused
to return to Oakland to claim his legacy.
Since then he has changed his mind.
"DOC" FLYNN
WINS FROM
ROCHETTE
Outpoints Him in a Ten-
Round Boxing Bout Before
the Columbia Club.
Boxer "Doc" Flynn outpointed Charley
Rochette last night In their ten-round
bout in the arena of the Columbia Ath
letic Club. Rochette had the better of
the earlier rounds, but his blows had no
apparent effect on his opponent From
the seventh round on Flynn maintained a
decided lead. Rochette having a difficulty
in lasting until the end. For three
rounds they boxed at fairly long range,
neither sustaining much damage. In the
fourth round Flynn caught Rochette
unawares and landed a jab on the head,
which jarred him.
In the succeeding round the men fought
all over the ring. In a scrimmage both
fell through the ropes, but did not fall to
the floor.
It was give and take for two rounds,
Flynn dazing Rochette with right and left
swings to the head. The eighth round
was a three-cornered fight between the
boxers and Referee McGinley. Rochette
was all but out and hung on to avoid pun
ishment. Flynn seemed comparatively
fresh, but could not get at his man.
Rochette came back strong for the ninth
round, but Flynn was content to take mat
ters easy. In the next round he went to
work quickly and again had Rochette in
trouble. The latter held on and lasted
until the bell stopped hostilities. The ref
eree gave the decision to Flynn without
hesitation.
The programme was onra of the *best
ever arranged by a minor club, there be
ing hardly a dull moment from first to
last.
The first bout between J. Lundy nnd
Harry Trost ended In the fourth round,
the former going out from sheer exhaus
tion, The boys fought as though their
lives depended on their efforts. They
were so game and tried so hard that the
crowd applauded as they would at a
championship fight. L.undy had the better
of the first round until he was knocked
down once, which changed the appearance
of things. In the second round Lundy
landed at will, but could not stop his
game opponent. Trost came back in the
next round and put It all over Lundy, who
Feemed anxious to retire. This round was
one of the most exciting ever fought by
amateurs.
Kid Dodson and Edward Wiley boxed
eight fierce rounds, the latter winning on
points. He knocked Dodson down In the
third round when he stayed down eight
Feconds. He went down again In the
eighth round, J:>ut was up In a moment
It was give and take for every moment
of the fight with Wiley, forcing matters
There were times when each of the boxers
were on the verge of going out, but they
stayed to the end.
William Condon was the aggressor In his
bout with William Perry and was award
ed the, fight by Referee McGinley. In the
last three rounds he was vicious and
rushed his opponent frequently. Before
the fight ended both men were In trouble
and nearly fell out of the ring from ex
haustion.
Charles Jackson and Jack Sullivan can
give polntern to any "knockabout team"
on the vaudeville stage. They .knockfd
one another down a dozen times In the
first round and repeated the performance
In the second, when the referee stopped
it. At the time Sullivan was taking a ter
rible beating and could not hold up his
hands. Previously he had his opponent
nearly out. There were more knockdowns
in two rounds than the average ring fol
lower would see in a lifetime.
It was announced that the club would
give thrrc exhibitions a month hereafter
and that more suitable quarters would be
secured. Tho present ones are cramped,
and many patrons of boxing refuse to en
ter them owing to the lack of proper ex
its in case of panic.
Al Neill and "Jack O'Brien signed arti
cles last night for a second meeting. The
matter of selecting a referee went over
for ten days to allow. O'Brien an oppor
tunity of looking over the Hat of. avail
able men.

THEIR FOURTH
DIVORCE SUIT
IS OK RECORD
Hostilities of Cahills
Renewed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. lL
The domestic tranquillities of Christo- 'â¢
pher J. and Margaret P. Cahill of Di- j
mond have sustained another jolt, hostiii- |
ties have been renewed and their old j
troubles will once more be aired In court, j
The fourth divorce suit between Mr. !
and Mrs. Cahill is now of record, the !
complaint en behalf of the husband hay- j
ing been filed late this afternoon. P. J.
Crosby; appear* as CahlU's attorney, and
the ground alleged for the divorce is
cruelty. It is likely that this last at
tempt at a legal separation will reach a
final termination in a decree of some sort. !
The third divorce suit, which was !
brought by Mrs. Cahill, met with ipnom- i
JnouF disaster on account of her willing- ,
ness to kiss and make up. The husband i
in his crfss-complaint on that occasion !
had chargr-d his wife with securing fraud- i
ulently from him an alleged deed to his ;
property In Dlmond. Thlr, instrument j
Mrs. Cahill had recorded to the soul
rasping displeasure of her husband. Judge I
â¢ Iroesic, however, declared he would not j
Brant the uife a decree until she should J
return the deed to her husband. Sud- !
flenly Mrs. CahllTs desire for a divorce \
vanished; tho parties left the courtroom, i
kissed and made up. But the deed has |
never been returned, and now Mr. Ca- j
hill wants both the deed and a decree of â¢
divorce. â¢ _Â¦-
pepsin and he received an assuring reply. He began
shortly afterward to be afflicted with pains in .his de
partment of the Interior and did not Bwallow the bis
cuits with the avidity he had displayed theretofore,
Miss Elinore took this as a grievous reflection on her
ability as a cook, and her remark's to the sufferer were
pointed. He appealed mutely to his tormentor and,
with drawn face and bent body, moved off the stage. He
bravely returned and carried out his part of the pro
gramme and then called on a doctor for relief.
An investigation disclosed the fact that Miss Kate Eli
nore had used a gargling medicine in place of the pep
sin which Is mixed with the batter so that Bryson can
assimilate the biscuits. It was therefore necessary to
pump that gentleman's stomach to relieve him of the
poison. Within two hours after being relieved of the
fluid, Bryson was once more before the public munch
ing the delectable biscuits with relish.
Miss. Ellnore apologized to her assistant for the pain
she had caused by explaining the mistake. She said last
night that she had feared her ability as a cook was in
question when Bryson made wry faces at the biscuits,
but when the cause was ascertained she again breathed
freely.
this morning on a charge of obtaining
money on false pretenses, pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to serve ninety days In
the County Jail. Since his arrest numer
ous complaints from people whom Flick-
Fteln had victimized have been received at
the Jail evidencing the fact that he is a
smooth and experienced crook.

TT HAVE said that women can and do
I pet liquor at drug stores in this city,"
I said License Inspector Henry Maloon,
â¢ "and I stand ready to prove my asser
tion.
"The matter of drugstore liquor sales
was called to my attention pome time ago
end 1 made investigations. I employed
four women and sent them around to the
drugstores of Oakland, and with the ex
teptlon of about half a dozen places they
?<Mind no trouble in securing liquor. Since
-.hat time I have continued my investiga
tions and 1 have found some very peculiar
tonditioMS.
"I know of canes where respectable
women, who move in good society, have
driven up to drugstores in their carriages
to pet liquor. As a general rule they buy
it by the bottle, but there have been cases
under my knowledge where they got
liquor by the glats and drank it on the
"Any woman- can get liquor in a drug
store by n:;tking the plea of pudden faint
:>>>, and that Is the excuse generally
riven. A woman drives up in her car
nape and tolls the clerk that she has been
taken ill and pets a drink as a medical
matter. This is probably true In some
cases, but the frequency with which it
was done made me suspicious of the real
reason and I have cÂ«ime to the conclusion
that it is merely a slight excuse given to
?ave the woman and the druggist at the
Mine time.
"Thof Â«Â» whom I ?ent around to the vari
ous drugstores secured liquor upon this
plea without a question being asked by
the clerks. On come occasions a pretense
was made of requiring a prescription. As
Tf-.s.' storÂ«-s all had regularly admitted
physicians in connection with their busi
ru 5.- the prescription was furnished right
In the Ftore.
I consider this a very dangerous form
<-f iiquor traffic. "Some of these drug
rtnreu pell more liquor than some of the
wholesale liquor stores. They sell it by
the bottle as well as by the prescription.
When they give a prescription and the
liquor or wine at the same time there la
nothing to do.
"The present license ordinance offers a
very large loophole for the sale of liquor*.
It provides that no license shall be re
quired for liquors sold for 'medicinal or
scientific purposes," that lets, any drug
i store sell liquor without the possibility
' of a conviction. This ordinance should be
j changed."
Mrs. Margarette B. Pelton, the leader of
1 the W. C. T. U. in Oakland, supports Li
cense Inspector Maloon in this matter.
"I have heard the same thing said," she
said, "and I am beginning to think that
| there is something to it. I am told that
j women go t<i drugstores and say. 'Let me
j have some liquor on that prescription I
loft here pome time ago. Frequently
I there has been no prescription, or one
! prescription on file is made to do mdcii
"There Is also another evil connected
with tho liquor trade. Grocers are asked
to buy liquors for their customers; so that
the customers may not bo compelled to go
into wholesale liquor stores. I am op
posed to these easy methods of overcom
ing the pride of a person."
Tho members of iho Oakland City Coun
cil all look at this matu-r in different
lights.
â¢'I have boon trying to cause one-reform
in the liquor ordinance." sahl Councilman
Taylor, "that I consider most vital. I
want tho agt> at which liquor ran be sold
to boys raised from 10 to IS years, but I
;mi afraid that If we attempt too many
reforms in other directions this will fall
through. There may be the same abuses
that have been complained of. but I do
r.ot see how they can be remedied with
out causing hardships upon necessary
lines of drugstore business."
"I don't consider whisky a medicine,"
paid Councilman Upton, "but if a man Is
going to drink I'd rather have him drink
in a drugstore than in a saloon. I would
like to see the license raised, for my
part."
"ThfÂ»re is no question about liquor being
sold in drugstores," said Councilman Gl
rard. "and my plan to make thorn pay a
license of $25 a quarter is the solution of
the question."
license Inspector Maloon's statements
undoubtedly wi'.l result in. some modifica
tions of the liquor license ordinance, but
what changes will bo recommended will
depend upon the report of the special

PROPERTY OF THE CITY
HAS BEEN GOBBLED UP
Wealth Easily Acquired Along the
Lake Merritt Shores.
An Effort Will Soon Be Made to Eject the
Horde of Trespassers on the
Public Lands.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Jan. 11.
PDUNCILMAN FELTON TAYLOR,
himself a resident and the represen-
Ltative of the aristocratic Fifth
Ward, is the man who says that
land all around the borders of Lake
Merritt has been seized by the holders of
adjacent property. The City Engineer's
office supports the statements of the Coun
cilman in general without any details hav
ing been secured and the Council commit
tees have recommended that the City En
gineer make surveys to determine how
much has been pre-empted.
If city property has been seized :n this
neighborhood it must have been done by
the wealthiest and .most fashionable resi
dents and property holders of Oakland
only their property abuts upon the lake.
This movement to oust the swell squat
ters who are illegally in possession of pub
lic lands along. the shores of Lake Merritt
promises to be more far-reaching in its
effects than a cursory first glance indi
cates. Should the city institute ejectment
proceedings against all of the alleged tres
pnssers and win the bulk of the cases it
will secure control of a large amount of
land which is of incalculable value.
According to the map in the City En
gineer's office showing the boundary lines
Detween public and private property the
encroachment upon the land UMonging
to the city was made at a wholesale rate
The east arm of the lake, which was
filled in some time ago, has been gobbled
up and the west arm disappeared from tho
public domain in a like manner. Along the
shore of the water between Jackson and
Madison streets the property has also
fallen into the clutches of private indi
viduals. Â¦ : â¢
"I have been making a thorough In
vestigation of the matter for some time
past." said Assistant City Kngineer Me-
Math. "And I cannot see how those peo
ple who are in possession of the land In
question ever derived ownership. Some of
them claim that, under deeds which they
hold, they own everything from the front
end of the land clear out into the middle
of the lake. I feel positive that they are
absolutely wrong.
"There are fine residences along the lake
shore, between Madison and Jackson
streets, which are located upon city prop
erty without a doubt. I helped to make
a resurvey of the city land boundaries
around the ia*e several years ago and
while there is some doubt as to the exact
location of the old Peralta line, still it
can be ascertained within a few feet of
the correct location. The survey was
made in 1554 and the points from which it
was done have all disappeared. It wa3
done under the supervision of the United
States Survey and there is no doubt that
the proper data on which to make an au
thentic resurvey could be secured at
Washington. This would undoubtedly
show property everywhere along the shore
which belongs to the city and has been
pre-empted by private individuals.
"Besides the property which I have spe
cifically enumerated there Is also a big
piece of land running along the south
side of Eighteenth street, between Sec
ond and Fourth avenues, which should bo
in the possession of the city, but which
is occupied and claimed by various people.
A few years ago it was covered with
water and connected to the lake with a
dam. Then it was tilled in and was grab
bed up. The people who took possession
cannot possibly have any right to It. .
"There is a similar case In that property
running from the lake to Second avenue
and bounded by Fourteenth and Sixteenth
streets. This was an arm of the lakÂ»>
and was filled In several years ago and
was pounced upon by private parties also.
Instances of this sort, but on a smaller
scale, occur all around the lake. Minia
ture bays have been filled in everywhere
and on every occasion the property haa
COUNCILMAN FELTON TAYLOR
been seized by adjacent landowners, who
unhesitating crossed the boundary line of
the city property to do It.
"The city ought to take possession of all
this property where there ia no doubt as
to its ownership and if the occupants ob
ject let them go to law about it. Then
the courts could appoint a commission to
determine the boundaries and the matter
could be finally and judicially settled."
"The Mayor and the Board of Public
Works are in favor of having the matter
settled, " said Secretary Jackson of tho
Hoard of Public Works. "And as soon as
the Council gets an official report showlrc:
what public lands are being encroached
upon, they are In favor of having the mat
ter definitely adjusted by court proceed
ings."
councilman i ayior. wno nrst urgen ac
tion on the part of the city to secure pos
session of the prnnerty which Is said to
have been illegally pre-empted by private
parties, is confident that his measure will
prevail In the Council. If It does, step*
will soon be taken to oust the wealthy
sauatters.

ers' Jack-pot, for, being a ,-ruaranteed af
fair. It cost the .association less than an
ordinary selling purse. At the weights
anything looked to have a chance and
there was really no pronounced choice in
the betting, though Erwln enjoyed 1 a
slight call over Anjou at post time. Hill
was fortunate in getting The Lady away
In advance of the field and she showed
a clear pair of heels to tte bunch tie en
tire route, leading Advance Guard over
the line a length In 1:41 fiat. With a
stronger rider In the saddle the latter
would have won, although no fault could*
be found with little Jack Martin's worV.
Swerving badly F. W. Brode, piloted by
Morgan, took the show by half a length
from Erwin.
It was another day of upÃets and uncer
tainties for the talent, horses at all sorts
of prices reaching the stand first. Ban
nockburn had the honor of being the only
winning favorite.
Once 40 to 1 in the ring. Uppercrust, a I
Prince Royal fllly. with Buchanan up,
downed the favorite. First Shot, two
lengths in the opening event. Coming
Event, an 8 to 1 chance, was third.
Barney Schreiber did enjoy a streak of
luck with Greyhurst in, the mile selling ,
run. Eddie Jones had the race in hand
with Tom Cromwell, the 1 to 2 favorite,
when he began easing up, and Bullman, j
astride the gray, beat nlm out a nose. The
judges mistrusted that Jones had been
drinking and refused to allow him to pilot
Dr. Bernay9 in the race, following. The
jockey later explained everything to the
satisfaction of the Btand and rode out the
balance of his engagements. . .
Old Meadowthorpe proved a surprise in
the mile and a quarter run. After Chimu
ra. Dr. Bernays, Forte and Dr. Marks
had breezed along the greater portion of
the distance under full-reefed sails Jen
kins, on Meadowthorpe, came with a great
rush, downing Chlmura a head. Forte
the favorite, ran unplaced. Twelve to 1
was laid agralnst the winner.
Bannockburn made quick work of his
field In the mile purse run. Starting an
11 to 20 rhance the brown horse won com
paratively easy from Malay In I:l'H4.
Rosormonde, second choice In the betting,
staid with Schrelber's horse for neatly
six furlongs, when she- "blew up" badly,
apparently being short of work.
In the closing six furlong sprint Moco
rito went the way of all the other favor
ites, losing to Ben Ledl. The latter filly
was never headed, disposing of the favor
ite by a length. Show honors fell to Jin
gle Jingle. Miss Marion and Storm King
were left at the post.
After the last race Mocorito ' was
claimed by F. \V. Doss, the owner of
Orion, getting the mare for $975. :~/- v

DAUGHTER IS GUARDIAN
OF TOO GENEROUS FATHER
FIFTT thousand dollars Riven away to strangers, friends and distant
relative* within the pa*t year is the record that caused Judge Troutt
yesterday to appoint Ella R. Smith guardian of the person and es
tate of her father. Robert Wilson.
Wilson is the owner of the Vienna Bakery and restaurant at 205
K>arny ptrert and. In addition, holds title to property on Valencia
street, between Eightc-er.th and Nineteenth; a large block of land at the
corner of Second and Point Lobos avenues and a large amount of money
in bank. Mrs. Smith filed an application yesterday morning to be appoint
ed Kvardian of the person and esnate of tho aeing capitalist on the ground
that his mind was falling and. with It. his estate through his desire to
or.rich these with whom he came in contact. Shortly after the filing of the
petition the matter was called for hearing by Judge Troutt. Mrs. Smith
took the Ftar.d and told the Ftory of her father's falling mind and the man
ner in which he had given away $53,000 in gold and securities during the
last twelve months. She said that unless some responsible person were ap
pointed to care for his property he would give It all away. Notwithstand
ing his generosity, he still is the owner of property valued at $100,000, and
was preparing to negotiate for its disposal when the petition to restrain him
was filed.
After Mrs. Smith left the stand. Wilson, who was in the corridor, was
brought into court and questioned. Well along In years and uncertain in
his movements, it was very evident that he was not of sound mind.
"I Intend to give, my daughter my bakery." he said, "but she has no
right to interfere In my private affairs. I met a man at Valle.Jo-I don't
remember who he wasÂ»â and gave him some money, and this made my daugh
ter angry. She can have her share, but she must not interfere with me
as I am perfectly able to dispose of my funds and take care of myself
without assistance."
Just who Is In possession of the various portions Into which the miss
ing Â£k,,000 was divided was not made dear during the examination, but suf
ficient evidence was forthcoming to convince Judge Troutt that In order to
protect the old man's estate, a guardian must be appointed. He calmed
the aged capitalist and said that he would take the matter under advise
ment, and Mr. Wilson left the courtroom satisfied. As soon as he was out-
Fide, Judge Troutt made the order appointing Mrs. Smith his guardian and
tixed her bonds at TiS.OOO. She Immediately notified the banks and took pos
session of his business, which she will manage until he recovers his mental
equilibrium or is summoned by death. Â¦-Â¦:.Â¦;Â¦ â¢
SAM RAINEY HAS
BEEN DISPLACED
BY NED LANIGAN
New Fire Boss Looms
in Sight.
JOHN GRADY FOR A PARTNER
COMBINATION FORMED TO DOWN
GEORGE MAXWELL
Sam Rainey, the old time boss of the
Fire Department, has been betrayed and
dethroned, but the signs of the hour In
dicate that a new fire boss has arisen.
Perhaps the situation could bes better de
scribed by saying that an old boss ha 3
been resurrected and that old timer Is
Ned Lanigan.
The reappearance of Ned Lanigan, arm
in-arm with John H. Grady, recalls to the
rounders the fact that the new boss was
deputy In the office of the Tax Collector
when Qradywag Collector. Lanigan also
made a stubborn fight to install Grady In
the License Collector's office, but lost the
battle. The reverse did not diminish the
ardor of Lanigan In the cause of Grady.
When the battle came on to elect dele
gates to the late Democratic Municipal
Convention Lanigan united his forces
with those of Rainey in the Forty-first
District and went into the fray shouting
for Phelan and good government under
the new charter. Buckley was recognized
then as the arch enemy of Phelan.
It was not apprehended by Rainey that
Lanigan would use the victory to even
up an old grudge against the Maxwells,
but now the suspicion arises in the camp
of the reformers that Lanigan has en
listed the services of Fire Commissioner
Grady to destroy Maxwell.
It is said that D. 1. Mahoney has been
drawn into close relations with Grady,
and that the two have Joined hands to
exclude Maxwell from the favor of the
commission.
Mr. Mahoney was brought Into the com
mission because of former close associa
tion In non-partisan conventions with
Frank J. Sullivan. Mayor Phelan's pre
cious brother-in-law.
In knltlng Maxwell Mahoney is exe
cuting the Phelan programme. Colonel
Mike Hecht, another member of the com
mission, shows an inclination to reinforce
Grady and Mahoney.
Citizens who fancied that the Fire De
partment, under the new charter, would
be kept out of politics may be prepared
for a grievous disappointment. Lanigan
has a pull that the commission is not in
clined to. ignore.
Acting Chief of Police Blggy is Ptlll at
it In Chinatown, swinging the ax into so
cial gambling club doors and gathering
In the denizens of the Nymphia. who
regard his moral sweeping with an indif
ference that Is doubling the labors of the
temporary Chief. All yesterday there
was an air cf unrest in the Chinatown
district and when Biggy, accompanied by
Captain Wlttman, appeared on the scene
last night a crowd was at his heels
watching for developments.
The hammering and battering in of
doors on the night previous taught the
Chinese gamblers a fleeting lesson. Fol
lowing out the orders of the new Chief
they unfastened their doors, so the police
might have ready and easy access to
the rooms above If they so desired to visit
them. But the "guests" of the Hotel
Nymphia and the occupants of Bacon
place did not display ei;ch a laudable de
slro to acquiesce in the orders of the
Chief.
The cases of the women arrested
Wednesday night came up before Police
Judge Conlan yesterday, and by consent
were continued until Saturday. The ball
was fixed at $150 per capita, and JSSCO waa
pledged in bonds for the release of the
women. When they gained their liberty
they Immediately made tracks to their
former haunts, and last night the lights
again blazed from the wickets.
The second raid on the Nymphia oc
curred about 9:30 o'clock last night. Chief
Biggy and Captain Wlttman with about
thirty officers raided the so-called hotel,
and the inmates were once more carted
off to the City Prison on the same charge
as before. It Is the intention of the Chief
to repeat this raiding performance every
night until the courts decide the ques
tion.
Uacon place still thrives, but a time
limit has been placed upon the occupancy
of these dens by the women who exist
there. When this time elapses out they
will go. Last night two olficers stood
guard at the entrace. demanding the
names of all who entered. This In a
measure kept the alley free from visitors.
Not only Is this moral pest the source
of much labor to the acting Chief. He Is
equally determined to clean out all Chi
nese gambling denp. With this end In
view two new squads of officials have
been added to the Chinatown patrol. Un
der Sergeant McManus are John
Galloway. Tom Burke. Dan Lyons
and George Collins: under Sergoant
Tom Ellis are William E. E. Rice.
Robert L. Norton, E. C. Robinson
and Nell Reardon. Sergeant Duke com
mands the regular Bquaa which has been

NEW YORK. Jan. 11.â Many of the out
of-town sporting men who came here to
see the battle for the feather-weight
championship between Terry McGovern
and George Dixon have remained over to
witness the twenty-five round mill be
tween "Kid" McCoy and Joe Choynski.
which Is to be decided In the ring of the
Broadway Athletic Club to-morrow night.
This will be the third meeting of these
men. McCoy gained a decision over
Choynski In a twenty-round bout decided
in San Francisco, while a six-round con
test between them In Chicago recently
was decided a draw.
McCoy's recent defeat of Peter Maher
In a masterly fashion puts him much the
favorite over Choynslci, who. however,
has always proved himself to be a tough
proposition. Chcyuskl claims to have Im
proved greatly and to be stronger than
ever, while McCoy Is ten pounds heavier
than he was when he last met the Cali
fornlan in the ring and quite as agile and
clever as he ever was. McCoy feels aa
confident as evor of putting Choynski out.
and the Calif ornlan said to-night of his
chances:
"I will be there to win. McCoy's vic
tory over Maher does not scare me In the
least." .. ..'. Â¦

Attorney Bert Schlesinger and Assist
ant United States Attorney Marshall B.

negligence on the part of Harada. During
the morning session one of the Jurors
John F. Thornton of 1717 Green street, was
seized with an attack of nervous prostra

DIRECTOR TO

Hayes' Term Expires
This Month.
SONNTAG IS A CANDIDATE
EXTRA SESSION WORK DONE BY
BROTHER HENRY.
Extra session advocates were active yes
terday. Many of the petitioners of the
commercial class were shown the way to
Governor Gage's rooms at the Palace
Hotel, and there told him why they re
quested an extra session of the Legisla
ture. The Governor did .not tell the pe
titioners when the proclamation would be
Issued. Before leaving for Sacramento
Gage passed an hour at the office of the
State Board of Harbor Commissioners.
It must not be inferred that all the
callers at the Palace yesterday were
pressing for an extra session. Many poli
ticians had other fish to fry. It is quite
well known that the ten-year term, of
Daniel E. Hayes as Prison Director ex
pires this month. Various sorts of pres
sure have been brought to bear on the
Governor to persuade him to appoint
Charles Sonntag to succeed him on the
board. On the other hand, prominent In
fluences have been invoked to induce the
executive to reappolnt Hayes.
It 13 fresh in the minds of the public
that Henry P. Sonntag of the North End
Improvement Club recently displayed con
spicuous energy in procuring signatures
for an extra session of the Legislature.
A rambling letter from the executive de
partment of the State government ac
knowledging receipt of the petition was
addressed to H. P. Sonntag. The stock of
Charles Sonntag. candidate for Prison
Director, advanced quite rapidly when the
contents of the Governors letter were
made known. Nothing, of course, was
said of prison affairs in the letter, but
politicians Jumped at the conclusion that
H. P. Sonntag was helping Gage to
smooth the way for an extra session, and
as a matter of reciprocity Gage would
make it easy for Sonntag's brother to get
on the Prison Board again.
Leading men of the State have said
many good words of the service rendered
on the board by Mr. Hayes. His Integ
rity and sound business Judgment are re
garded as valuable attainments. He Is a
Republican and therefore from a political
point of view eligible for another term.

POLICE JUDGES
DRAW THE SHORT
AND LONG TERMS
Cabaniss and Mogan
Made Happy,
THEY ARE ON THE LONG END
QUESTION OP "DEUNZS" AND
"0. B'S" STLLI, UNSETTLED.
The suspense under which the four Po
lice Judges have been laboring since the
election to determine which would have
the long and short terms of four years
and two years was ended yesterday
afternoon. As a result, two are anath
ematizing their bad luck, while the other
two are all smiles.
Judge Murasky was selected as referee
and the drawing took place in his court
room between 1 and 2 o'clock. The
method selected was to have four envel
opes, each containing the name of a
Judge, put in a ballot box. and four en
velopes containing a slip with the term
written on it were put in another ballot
box. Judge Murasky drew one of the en
velopes from each box and placed them
together. Then each pair waa opened.
The first to know his fate was Judge
Fritz, who got a two-year term. He
plainly showed his disappointment, but
accepted his fate like a man. Judge Ca
baniss then drew one of the lucky "fours"
and Judge Mogan drew the other. Judge
Conlan knew what was In the other en
velopes, but to make the drawing com
plete they were opened and he. of course'
got the other two-year term.
The amount at stake was two years
salaryâ s72ooâ and the cost of running for
otflce at the next election, which, com
bined, waa something to be anxious
about.
The Police Judges are now a unit In re
gard to the disposal of the "drunks" and
the issuance of "O. B.'s." It was in
tended to have a meeting yesterday to
see if an understanding could not be ar
rived at with the acting Chief of Police
and the District Attorney, but It was not
held.
Judge Fritz set an example yesterday.
Mrs. Elizabeth Hart was arrested Wed
nesday night at Powell and O'Farrell
streets by Policeman Sylvester on charges
of vagrancy and "drunk." She remained
in prison all night and appeared yester
day morning before Judge Fritz. The ar
resting officer was not present and the
Judge had to continue both cases till thi3
morning. Mrs. Hart's attorney told the
court that she was a respectable woman
and lived in San Mateo. She had come
to the city for a day and was on the way
to her temporary lodging when arrested.
The Judge, under the circumstances,
fixed her bail on the vagrancy charge at
$20 and on the "drunk" charge at 5 cents,
saying he did not believe in keeping her
another day In prison on a "drunk"
charge simply because the officer was not
in court to testify.
Judge Cabanlss says he has no objec
tion to having the "drunks" in his court,
but sees no necessity for having a com
plaint drawn up and sworn to by the ar
resting officer.

Warm Praise for Mrs. Alexander and

"When we consider that the work I
have briefly attempted to sketch has been
largely that of women, I think the capa
city of our sex for the care and manage
ment of extensive business and dharltable
affairs cannot be successfully disputed."
This was the concluding paragraph In
the address of Mrs. Willard B. Harring
ton, president of the board of lady man
agers of the Hospital for Children and
Training School for Nurses, delivered yes
terday at tho annual election of officers.
Vigorous handclapping demonstrated
that the other ladles thought the claim
justified.
After reviewing the history of the insti
tution from the beginning, Mrs. Harring
ton proved by figures that it Is no longer
an experiment. While the receipts from
1575 to 18S7 were only $64,000. from the lat
ter date until the present time they have
amounted to more than $450,000. Special
attention was drawn to the Alexander
Maternity Home, donated and largely sup
ported by Mrs. Alexander, and to the
Homo for Nurses, which is fast nearlng
completion. In mentioning this new build
ing Mrs. Harrington took occasion to say
that its large and well-eQuipped laundry
waa made a possibility by Mrs. Claus
Spreckels, who defrayed the entire cost.
The report of Mrs. F. H. Green, the
treasurer, Bhowed the total receipts for
last year to havo been $54,880 10; expenses,
$52,030 60; cash on hand January 1, 1900,
for current expenses, $2952 27, and for the
nurses' k home, $3379 78.
Mrs. Emma C. Lafontalne, secretary of
the dispensary staff, furnished a report
stating that during JS99 tho total number
of women and children registered In clin
ics was 47C, and the total number of pa
tients treated during the same year was
2649.
Superintendent J. Myrta Newbury gave
the number of nurses now In the training
school as forty-six. Twenty-five have
completed the two years' course. There
were 267 applications to enter the school
last year, only thirty-four being accepted.
The report of the secretary, Mrs. L. L.

Grammar School" and the "Lester Schwa

Harris I. Martin, $2000; estate of Charles
Pace, $452, and estate of Robert Bright.
$423. The most significant paragraph in
Mrs. Dunbar's report was as follows:
In addition to the entertainments given
during the year under the supervision of
the hospital one or two other entertain
ments were advertised as being given for
the benefit of the hospital, but we received
nothing from them, the receipts probably
being consumed by the expenses. Such en
tertainments are a detriment, giving tho
public the false Impression that the hoe
pltal Is being benefited, as no statement Is
made to the contrary. It seems almost Im
possible to prevent the hospital's name bÂ«
ing thus used.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 12, 1900.
STEWARDS OF
TANFORAN MAKE
PUBLIC APOLOGY
Corrigatt's Offense Is
Denounced.
RECEIVES A CRUSHING REBUKE
THE AFFAIR MAY GO STILL
FURTHER.
The Management of the Western Turf
Association Admits Its Respon
sibility for the Actions of
the Accused-
"The "Western Turf Association extends
an apology to the California Jockey
Club." That is the conclusion of the d!s-
' graceful affair la which Ed Corrigan
I brought reputable men to his level by
i forcing them at Tanforan last Saturday
' to listen to his foul abuse of R. B. Milroy.
The apclopy of the Western Turf Asso
ciation Â¦will be trailed to-day. In two as
pects it is of the greatest sigr.lficance.
In the first place, it is an announcement
to the public by the Tanforan manage
ment that it is responsible for the ac
tions of Ed Corripan, who if he is not
â¢ostensibly a r=n. of \he management is
!r, realty so. in the second place, it is a
'rebuke more severe and biting than Cor
rijran ever before received in his history.
In substance, it tells him that even if he
â¢has fastened himself upon the Western
Turf Association, he must act as men do
nho consider themselves within the pale
of civilized society.
The Western Turf Association might
have found another way out of the dif
firu'.'.y involved in the demand of the
Calitornia Jockey Club. The Tanforan
people could have insisted that when Sec
retary Ml'roy visited Tanforan he did not
do po in an official capacity, and that
CTTitran represented only himself at the
track. He then could have been discip
lined and the Western Turf Association
would have been spared the humiliation
of giving an apology to the California
Jockey Club. Hut a different course was
chosen by the ptev.-axds of Tanforan at
their meeting last night.
The ground that was covered on Tues
day r.'Rht was traversed apaln. R. B.
Milroy. Sam Rainey. Charles Kenneally,
William Murray and Ed Corrigan pave
their Testimony. Even Corripan admitted
that he had beon abusive, and the others
described his attack as one that cannot
be pictured In a public newspaper. After
deliberating- for some time the stewards
announced their purpose to make an apol
ogy to the California Jockey Club.
When Corrigan heard the report he was
furious. He wanted to know what the
"Western Turf Association had done that
it should apologize. He demanded to
know for what it was offering an apol
ogy, but his questions remained unan
swered-
It has been stated that the officers and
members of the California Jockey Club
had returned their badges to the W?stÂ«>rn
Turf Association. This is an error. The ]
tacges weuld have been returned had not !
an &.pology been given, but now probably ,
they will not be. It is probable that the j
Tanforan management will go further and i
discipline Corripan for his gross violation i
*>f one of the important rules of the Turf i
Congress.
