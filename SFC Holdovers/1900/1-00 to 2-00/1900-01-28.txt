The Japs were being hustled out. There
were no women among them. It is s<!d
that the Japanese women are subjected
to closer examination, for the reason that
Chinese women attempt to land In Japa

Japanese than the Chinamen to effect a

"A lady from the Emerald lale came

tle laciy with a German accent. "I can
take these with me, can't I. without ex

"They will be examined as they pass tho

The lady did not look as if she had
opium in her grips; she may not have had
silks or laces either, but the frightened ex
pression on her face indicated that what
ever It was it would not be there when
she crossed the gangplank.
Out in the steerage portion of the ship
things looked rather deserted, and the lit
tle canvas bunks for the Chinese immi
grants were all empty.
"Gone to Angel Island," explained some
one, "to be fumigated and to await ex
amination and inspection. They go over
until to-morrowâ twenty-nine Japs, forty
two Chinese, nine Koreans and the stow

The stowaway had boarded the ship at
Japan and was to be held in quarantine
for trachoma, a contagious disease of
the eyelid.
"Hi, there!" called an authoritative
voice. "The boat Is going back. Every
thing finished for to-day? Come aboard."
There was a small progressive newsboy,
who had managed to get on board some
way. He sold all his papers, but was
frightened almost out of his wits when
threatened with fumigation.
"You'll have to go with the Japs over
to Angel Island to be fumigated," they
told him.
"Lord, sirs, yer don't meant It, sure?
Tou'uns won't do It, will yer, honest?"
The- voice was trembling and full of plead

The next afternoon the Gaelic steamed
to the wharf at the Pacific Mail dock. She
had been thoroughly disinfected and fumi
gated, and had come for. a two weeks'
rest. The Chinese cabin passengers wera
aboard. The disposition of all Chlnesa
Immigrants 13 left entirely to the special
Chinese Bureau. A few officials from
that department were on hand for tha
especial accommodation of the aristo
cratic Celestials of the cabin. A Chinese
merchant of fabulous wealth, with his
wife, babies and servants, were the first
In line.
"Velly glad." said the little lady; "velly
glad see land; likee see." They were re
turned residents, and the father was busy
showing up his certificates with the pho
tographs out In the smoking room. When,
everything was adjusted the Celestial
family trotted down the gangplank and
away into the city. The two or three re
maining Chinese cabin passengers were
attended to with like dispatch and allowed,
to go. but for the plain, everyday plebeian
there was more trouble. Shut up In the

their native gibberish and await the time

"One fellow left over there sick," was
the explanation.
"All right. 'â¢ Come along, you fellows.

Gaelic. Hul! hui!"
The little brown men and the unique
Koreans In pajamas and boblnet hats filed
Into an awkward line and trotted on
board, followed by the uniformed and
awe-lnsplring Inspectors.
They were brought up one at a time,
dropping Oriental courtesies and scared to
death.
"Menjah!" demanded the Japanese ques
tioner.
Each handed out his passport tn turn
or was sent to search for it among his
baggage. Their "menjahs" were evident

wrapped In a dozen folds of silk.

"These are the fellows we have to

farmer class began to pour in. "They are
the laborers, and if we find them coming

They were shuffled off deftly. The rapid

of seven more or so to come. Being
a saleslady, or le*s elegantly speak
ing, a "counter hopper." means many
things â some odd. some funny and
dome only disagreeable â but seven years
cf it strikes me as bring nothing so much
as tiresome and monotonous.
The girls who have homes and home
purroundings are fortunate, for there are
a great many of us who are not fo lucky.
Just how we get along on our earnings is
a my.stery to the unitiated and a marvel
to even ourselves. The time left from
work and sleep is spent in cooking on an
oilstove balanced on the edge of a wash-
Ftand in some meanly furnished room,
the rent of which is an ever-threatening
calamity.
Home of the girls go in together, and
by combining incomes and ingenuity man
age the semblance of a home, with a tiny
parlor for the reception of friends, a
kitchen handy and convenient, inasmuch
as one can sit in the middle of It and
reach anything within its walls, and a
dark little sleeping room, brightened up
by such trinkets as the ffminine nature
manages to gather about itself under the
circumstances.
At work everything depends on the floor
manager. If he is good natured every
thing goes along pretty well; we can do
about as we please so long as we look
out not to break any of the rules of the
house. If we have a cranky floor man
ager, we are In eternal fear of his dis
pleasure.
The "red tape" of the store manage
ment keeps us in a continual state of
Â¦worry, ror there are so many rules and
regulating to follow and they are
changed no often that unless we are al
ways keeping our eyes open and on the
lookout we are certain to transgress in
pome way. In some places the nuisance is
almost done away with, and one can do
almost as one pleases, and actually has
an opportunity to exercise one's own
judgment: but there are stores in San
Francisco that make the lives of clerks
a continual round of distress, worry and
terror. For three years I worked in one
rtt the prominent business houses on Mar-<
ket street, and those three years of my
life I remember as a nightmare. 1 have
a little book of their rules and regula
tions, which was given me when I went
there, and which they failed to have re
turned when I left. Here is a list of some
of the misdemeanors and fines:

conversation.
fipoaking with salesman or saleswoman,

the wrapping desk. The same will be
handed to the employes on leaving for the
night, at the door.
Employes will be held responsible for
all errors and breakage.
No employe will be paid when absent
irom duty from any cause whatever.
Employes will personally report to the
floor manager when leaving their post
of duty for any purpose except to transfer
a customer, always stating where you
intend going, and report to him upon
your return.
On leaving or entering the department
to or from meals or the store for any pur
pose whatever, employes must call their
time to the timekeeper and await until
the timekeeper repeats the number back.
When any article in our line cannot bo
found in our stock when called for, mako

is kept in every department for that and
similar purposes.

are followed by Fuggestlons as to be
havior toward customers, toward each
other and our superiors. There is no
possibility left for the exercise of personal
judgmentâ everything is cut and dried,
and in such a complicated manner as to
keep one in continual confusion and per
plexity.
For our work we are allowed irom $2
to flO per week; recently women have
been promoted to the high office of floor
walker, and she who is fortunate enough
to obtain that position receives a salary
that takes our breaths away with Its
enormityâ sometimes Jl5 per week.
We noon know the type to which a cus
tomer belongs when we see one coming.
If a woman comes In, we look fr,r
trouble â if two women come In we look
for twice as much, and If three are to
gether, it is a time to despair. It Is im
possible to please all three, and the one
who is doing the buying has very little
or nothing to say about the purchase.
The other two suggest all kinds of objec
tions, and recall visions of superior or
more desirable goods they have seen rlso
whero In their afternoon round, and the
result Is usually an Item of half an hour
or po.ln the "swappook." a small blnn!c
pamphlet in which we are required to
make note of the time lost on cu?tonvrs
who do not buy. We are expected to m?ke
a sale if it be possible, and it is according
to the number of sales we make that our
standing is considered. If we are unfor
tunate onoi.gh to have a number of
"swaps," there Is a big item of lost time
against our names and our position 13 en
dangered.
If a man Â£>nd a woman come \r. together
there is not going to be very much trouble
âfor the man will be impatient and tne
woman a little bit ashamed of making so
much trouble.
Tf a man comes In aloneâ it Is a "snap"
lie is easy. When a man goes to buy
anything nc wants to get it over with,
and he proceeds to buy. He invariably
knows what he Is after and exactly wh.it
he wants to pay for it. The men are "all
right"â that is the verdict of all the sales
girls.
A woman often goes shopping without
knowing what she is after, the price, the
color, quality or anything else. The bar
gain counter Is where she becomes entire
ly insane. A woman will buy anything
for 53 rents that she would scorn to con
sider for a dollarâ ar.rl It doesn't matter
whether she has the least use for it In th>?
â¢world. A man, if he falls into the hands
of an unscrupulous clerk, is apt to get
the worst of it a little. He is so easily
pleased. that >t is a good chance to get
rid of "hard" or unsalable stock. Most
of us Fccrn to take such an advantage be
cause we are grateful for the considera
tion a man shows us. However, it is
amusing to see the way a man will go
about buying things for the feminine
members of his family. He will often go
away with an ash tray thinking he has
a. hairpin receiver, and he doesn't know
anything about shade or color usually.

el?e under the sun could mar.ag".
Sometimes aftrr a woman had taken
up an hour or so of our time she will rise
with the remark that "she will bring her
husband in" to sre th** ginds. In fact,
that remark is Â«r> frequent that when one
of thi3 type takes her departure a neigh
boring clerk will question. "Gone to bring
her husband in?" They will frequently
say that they have not any money with
them, that they have to go get their
watch from the jeweler's or will Simply
remark, when everything in stock is be
fore them on thÂ° counter, that they were
downtown with nothing to do. and they
"were just amusing themselves.**
These are the kind of people wÂ« call
"swaps." T don't know where the term
tlrst came from, but there is not a girl
behind a counter in S.'-n Francisco that
doesn't know the meaning of the word.
This gave ri.-o to the odious "swapbook"
that some of the stores use, and which I
have already mentioned.
If a < ustomer begins t<"> speak highly of
anything you can rent assured that she*
does not mean to buy. When anything
is ""perfectly lovely" or "just Xnn sweet"
we know that the lady is a "swap" and
that she is going to go away without thÂ»
goods.
We have lot* cf trouble with "ex
change?." too. People seem to. get thft
idea that because the article 13 an ex
change we are going to try to play off an
inferior quality of goods on them; when
they wish goods exchanged for a different
shade we have the greatest time per-
Mi.ii'.ii.K th^m that the goods are of tha
same quality, that they come from tho
tame loom; and they probably go away
with the idea that they have been grossly
wronged.
The force of habit is strong with the
shop girl. She is only a machine, any
way. So much of her time is spent In
catering to the public that she hasn't tlmo
to think of anything else, hardly.
Four of >is were eating a hasty lunch at
a restaurant one day when some one
wanted something. The waiter was some
where else just then, and one of the girls
startled herself as well as the rest of us
with an inv;.ur.tary demand n the ortho
dox high-pitched key for "Cash boy â
("ash:" The people around us smiled
sympathetically, while the confused sile*
lady hastily occupied herself with coffea
and sandwiches.
Sometimes a lady leaves her pocketbook"
behind, ar.tl when she comes back Â»or It
she wears a look of accusation en her
face, and when it is returned to her from
the "Found" counter, she takes it witn an
air that plainly .says. "You were afraid Â».o
keep iJ. I told you so."
There is ore type of man that cannot be
called a 'snap." It is the dandy. He '.3
equal to two women, and sometimes three.
It will take him an hour or so to plclc out
a necktie, and when he has bought t the

The good-natured old gentleman, alter
the pattern of the successful Kloniikt r.
usually comes in in tow of two or thre^
feminine members of the family, and there
is a great hurly-burly, but Tire usually
make large sales and we like to see them,
for every one in the party is generally
good-natured.
The salesgirl work? from S until Â«5: t!*Â«it
means she most be at her post at Ti.TO and
have uncovered and dusted her goods by
8. and she puts away and recovers the
goods after 5. In the holiday season, she
works three or four hours in the evening,
and half her Christmas and 'Thanksgiv
ing, and perhaps the whole of her Krw
Year, are n-er.t in the way of ether Jayj.
She must look sharp to her fines. Tor
she canmt afford to lessen ncr salary: If
she is ill she Is made no allowance for
years of faithfulness to her firm, and
therefore Â»h* can seldom afford the luxury
of being sick. Vacations are hera In
theory only; she cannot even anticipate.
Sometimes skc consoles herse'f with tha

comparisons from the wrong view point
she can find comfort; her life is by no
means a primrose path, and the thorns
and thistle? bristle out plentifully, b-.it If
she makes the best of it she thinks anÂ« is
a great deal better off than some folksâ

right. But I have found seven years of it
very irksome, and am not lookln? fir â¢

LIFE OF THE SHOP GIRLwas not large enough for turning around.
But the occupant who studies, sleeps,
cooks and eats here seems very contented.
She Is an unusually line scholar, pos
sessed of cultured tastes as the classic
photographs on the wall bore witness.
There are a number of these attic rooms
on the campus and some of their owners
I was told get through on nine or ten dol
lars a month.
From here we went to the girl editor's
quarters. I obeyed the direction over the
front door bell, and " two long rings and
a short" brought my hostess. We paused
to peek Into the room next hers. Its
a really Jovial family circle. But â¢ the
altruistic spirit of the place showed itself
most strikingly in the friendly, yea sis
terly, interest taken by all in each caller,
which might be annoying were it not so
obviously well-meaning. It takes the
nonchalance tliat comes of much social
experience to brave the Roble threshold.
Through the attic window we were gaz
ing at the moonlit hills when three ex
cited girls rushed in to announce that two
football heroes were below. Inquiring for
the freshie. The little maid, blissful in
her ignorance of Roble methods, descend
ed calmly â not so calm those left behind.
From room to room and floor to floor
they rushed to spread the tidings of the
coming of these knights of the gridiron
two of them, and to see a freshie. too!
Valor got the better part of discretion.
The girl on whose door was pinned the
forbidding sign, "Digging." and the one
too lazy to finger her mandolin, Jofhed
the rest on the upper landing. There was
a craning over the banisters for a glimpse
of the idols, who unconscious of this flat
tering attention were behaving like any
unspoiled young men. But their wretched
hostess opposite with eyes wandering be
yond them to the everchanglng host on
the stair endured her first and greatest
Roble agony. At length, the siege aband-
to peeK into tne room next ners. us
walls hung with matting and cones and
moss gave it an air of the mountains. The
earnest owner earns her board one place
and her rent another. Many and va
ried are the ways in which women dig
out their college money. The postmistress
is a Stanfordite. Coaching nets a fair
sum. Some women teach a year and then
go to college a year. Brother and 3lster
will alternate at teaching and studying
by the year to give each a chance at a
university training. There are a number
of instances of husband and wife taking
turns at country pedagogy and college
work in this way, enabling the two to get
degrees in eight years. Several girls do
housework to make their way. The sign
on the editor's door stopped me. "Yes
terday was ray busy day Â§ To-day is
worse." But she laughed and pushed me
into the quaintest den I'd seen. A chim
ney ran through its center, so that with
screens one might divide and subdivide it
at pieasure. The freshman chum's couch
and desk were screened off, over in cne
comer. In one of the two deep recesses
with high windows poking out on the
campus was the culinary department and
close by a door led into a "love of a pan
try," under the sloping roof. Here was
the dining corner and. here the editorial
sanctuary and the "hatrack," a small

not extravagant sum. There is never any

lady of the pen ensconced herself on a
cushioned dress box and while she
strummed her guitar, told me something
of the girls' organizations. "This Is not
a very musical place. 'still we have two
flourishing clubs. The Stanford Glee
Club, though It does not sing with the
â¢Varsity Glee, gives numbers on the same
programme sometimes. The Ladles" Man

Men's at concerts, which gives us a
chance to advertise "thirty people on the
stage at once,' etc. The Y. W. C. A. while
not so active as the Y. M. C. \., holds

But you want to know my exact rea
sons for leaving the ministry. First, let
me quote from our local paper at Benicia
the words of farewell written by the
trustee and clerk of the church: "Rev.
James C. Maclnnes has been with us for
the past sixteen months, and by his earn
est endeavor and conscientious work has
made many warm friends. During his
stay here he <iat. greatly built up tho at
tendance at the church service and the
Christian Endeavor, and has gotten the
church on a good, firm financial basis.
The news of Mr. Maclnness' departure
from our city is received with universal
regret, and the best' wishes of a' host of
friends will follow him to the new home,
wherever It may be."
And also tho set of resolutions adopted
unanimously by the church at its annual
meeting:
Resolved, That the First Congrega
tional Church of Benicia, at its annual
meeting held January 9, 1900, extend to
its retiring pastor, Rev. J. C. â¢ Maclnncs,

istry â to give up all that he had
worked years to accomplish, and to
admit tJiat he had been mistaken in
choosing such a vocation.
The Reverend James Maclnncs
is now plain Mister James Mac
hines.
The mere fact that he saw fit to
abandon the ministry would have
caused not a little surprise among
his brethren, but nothing in com
parison to the squall that has arisen
on account of the reasons tendered
by the rczrrcnd gentleman for this
resignation. Such a stir have
these same "reasons" made that
even laymen have become intensely
interested and arc anxiously await"
THE SUNDAY CALL,
ciation were accompanied by a well-filled
purse. This is surely an evidence of the
cordial feeling that exists bettveen tho
'church and its retiring pastor.
I left the ministry because I became
convinced that I was never called to that
sacred office. If the poet is born to his
life's work, ko is the true minister. He
must be ordained to It before his birth;
he must hear the holy call within his
neart. It must be a burning firo within
him, and his cry "Woe is me if I preach
not the Gospel.'^ My idea of entering the
ministry came by the advice of a zealous
but misguided friend at a time of great
personal sorrow. In two months I had
lost a favorite brother and my mother;
our home was broken up and there
was an estrangement between my
father . and myself. All these my
unwise friend urged as voices from
God, calling me to dedicate ray
llfo to tho ministry. What blas
phemy! I was a mere youth: I listened
and accepted his advice. If I dedicated
my life to God, then he was worthy of
my very best, and I prepared a course
covering twelve years of study. As I
progressed in my studies 'the conviction
stole upon me that I had never been set
apart for that work, but I resolved to
givo It an honest trial. After three years
of experience In the active ministry and
earnest thought and prayer. I became
convinced that I was not called to the
church. What way was then open to me
but to leave It? It was no easy matter
to say that I had made a mistake, but
I must be true to the still small voice of
conviction whatever the consequences; so
I resigned, and honestly told my people
why I dare no longer be their minister.
This conviction of my never having been
called to the ministry was deepened as I
studied myself and studied tlae nature
and offices of tho true minister. A. minia-
wanted to tell them how good It had made
me feel and the exact foundation there
â¢was for the article that called forth the
expression of their opinion. I was guile
less enough to believe that these men
would be glad to know that I had never
said that the "church was full of hypo
crites." and for that reason I was leaving
It. I thought that they would be pleased
to listen to the real causes, and those who
had publicly wronged "me would be manly
enough to apologize for hasty words
spoken through misrepresentation. I
thought their sense of right and Justice
would lead them to make some kind of
public reparation, since their bitter and
unjustifiable condemnation had been pub
lic. I was guileless enough, I say, to be
lieve that such was my due and such they
would do. Unfortunately I chose a wrong
Monday. If I had waited for another
Monday morning I might have had a
more ready hearing, but this was their
I'entecostal Monday. They were set on
working themselves up into a frenzy of
emotionalism and calling it a baptism of
the Holy Ghost. They were hard at it
as I entered, and when I arose to speak
they were afraid that I might break the
spell. Only by dint of perseverance and
amid protests was I granted five minutes
to make my statement. What to them
was right and Justice? What to them
Â¦was truth? What to them that a man's
reputation had been blackened, and they
helped to blast it? They had no time to
make wrong right; they had no time to
seek and know the truth of tho affair;
they had no time to help a brother who
ter is one who serves his fellow man In
spiritual things. He must be a prophet,
priest and pastorâ all these' functions he
must reverently and devoutly fill in obe
dience to the Inner voice and prompting.
He must be a pastor â a shepherd who
goes into the home and to the erring with
the tender and precious word of God. He
mv.st love his work, for love makes hard
tasks pleasant; love leads to tact. As a
pastor he comes very close to the people
and no sense of duty can perform that
office. Pastoral work was to me very dis
tasteful. I delighted to meet my friends
In a social way, but to go forth to make
?astoral calls, urged by the love of souls,
never did. because I never had the In
ward prompting. Here waa a battje In
my soul and great sorrow. I would not
affect what I did not honestly feel, and
not feeling It, I doubted the genuineness
of my right to be a pastor.
The true minister must also be a priest,
one to stand between God and the soul
of men, leading the soul unto its god; the
sacred symbols of the church he must
present with reverent hands. He must
break the bread and bless the wine of
holy communion. He must take the babe
In his arms and consecrate It by the sot
emn right of baptism: he must unite man
and woman In the bonds of matrimony.
He must commit the body to the earth as
God's anointed priest. If he feels that
he. has not been called to that holy office
all these symbols become a mockery, and
the doing of them a profanation to him.
When I felt In my soul that God had not
called me to that sacred office, I dared no
longer perform its functions. The true
minister must be a prophet, not one wlto
"foretells, but one who forth-tells"â one
-who npeaks for God. He must come be
fore his people with a message that God
has put Into his heart and on his lips for
the people. What aaawXuJ responsibility:
ing a statement from Mr. Mac
hines as to his exact attitttde in
the matter.
Mr. Machines has a fine church
record, he has lifted the debt from
both of the churches that fell to his
care â first from Oak Leaf Chapel
in Oakland and then from the Con
gregational church of Bcnicia. He
zcon the admiration and friendship
cf all his parishioners.
Exactly what he thinks of the
church end just why he determined
to leave it is frankly and ablx told
in the following, especially written
for the Sunday Call by Mr. Mac
hines himself:
THE editor of the Sunday Call has
asked me to ptate my reasons for
leaving- the Christian ministry and
has promised to print what I write,
except the bad ppelling. I give my
6tlf gladly to the task, fnr I am grateful
for the opportunity of speaking at first
hand. I have been quoted as saying that
the church is fuil of hypocrites and that
that is the chief reason for my leaving
it. I deny that I ever said that the church
Js fuil of hypocrites. I do say and believe
that there are churchgoers who are steep
ed la hypocrisyâ people who co to church
for the htanfling that it may give ihem
in social or business circles Just as some
men Join the Masons and other orders for
the prestige it gives them. Hypocrisy has
lts.eeat in human nature. There is not
a walk in life where we don't find itâ ln
business, law, medicine, po!it!cs and es
pecially in society. The church Is made
up of human beings and can we wonder
that some hypocrisy creeps into the
church? For the benefits to be derived
therefrom, the church would naturally at
tract hypocrite?. They are the black sheep
in the Hock. But I have always paid and
firmly believe that the good people In
church are beyond compare with these
outside. And the truly good people in
church far outnumber the hypocrites who
mask under false piety.
I believe if a man needs a drink he has
the right to take one. providing he has
the money to pay for It. There is a dif
ference between taking a drink and
drunkenness. The question of drinking,
dancing, card playing and kindred en
joyments is a matter of personal liberty
and must be settled by the individual con
science. Personal liberty Js the most Ba
rred thing in the world, and by personal
liberty I mean the right to think right
or the right to think wrong; the right to
do right, but not the right to do wrong;
for a man is not only an individual, but
a social unit, and his wrong action is
injurious to his neighbor. Personally I
do not dance, but my not. dancing is no
reason why I should forbid another an
innocent enjoyment. I believe that a
man who may take a drink and indulgo
in many of the amusements which som
churches taboo may be nearer the king
dom of heaven than a man within the
church who may refrain from doing any
of these things, but whosp heart Is full
of petty meannesses and bigotry and self
ishness. I have personally met men who
pot drunk who 1 believe have more real
Christian spirit than Eomtf of tho promi
nent members in our churches. This is
not praising a man for his drinking, but
simply riving the poor devil his due.
The office of the minister carries with
it a certain demeanor and dignity. Of
course this has been overdone in the past
âministerial dignity passing into a pro
verb. But the recognition of being called
and i<et apart for the. work of spiritual
ministration ought to make the individual
serious; there is a difference, however,
between wholesome and morbid serious
ness; for my own part I Bay candidly I
bad too little of the ministerial dignity.
I have been misquoted on some points,
bat I do not hold the reporters guilty of
halt the injustice that I do the ministers.
Why I Leave the Ministry

3Â£e3Â§ J Ksaluilojtf and words of apprÂ«-
w
to stand before your congregation as tha
prophet of God, professing to have a liv
ing, burning message from him to your
people, fjow often I have walked mv
study floor praying for light, and wring
ing my hands in agony at the thought of
the responsibility that weighed upon mo.
I never entered my pulpit except in iÂ»ir.
A prophet of God differs from a teacher
of truth and morality, and when a man
enters the pulpit, by that act he an
nounces that he is one who speaks tor
God. I could no longer do it. because J no
longer felt that I was God's ambassador
to any people..
The ministry I feel to be the most
sacred, the most noble, and may I mv.
the most desirable of all callings. Gladly
would I take all Its responsibilities, most
gladly perform its offices and rejoice to
accept its limitations and hardships, if I
could but feel that I was worthy of it.Â«
eacred trusts. I envy certain of nty
brothers who, I know, have heard the
true call, and ere obeying It in their life s
work.
I left the ministry because I believed T
was better qualified to serve God ns a.
Christian bustnefis man than as a Chris
tian minister. I have always had an en-*
thusiasm for business. Before I reached
the age of twelve I was deep Into It. My
father answered my refusal to atten.l the
public schools by putting me in the fac
tory, and I was happy. During my col
lege course my heart was more in busi
ness than In study. When I began my
active ministry I rejoiced to take a
church that was in debt, and when it was
free from that burden I felt there was
nothing left for me to do. Whatever of
success that has attended my ministry
has been along secular rather than spirit
ual lines. After 1 had decided to leave
the ministry there came to me a splendid
opportunity to engage in business. If I
had received an Invitation to a larger
church with an Increase of salnry. mv
friends would have called It the leadings
of the Lord. Why cannot we say thai
thie business opening was as much hi*
leading as a larger pulpit and congrega
tion? I believe that the greatest need to
day Is men of business qualification and
energy to make money for God. It is
as holy as preaching. And as for doing
good as Christ defined itâ feeding the
hungry, clothing the naked, helping the
unfortunateâ the business man has quite
as many chances as the minister, anl
often more means to do It with. I be
lieve that one helps forward the kingdom
of God quite as much In helping a poor
boy who has talent for muaic or art or
mechanics to a better education as In
spending along the line o.f his abilities
money to help some blockhead to b<j
come a minister. The kingdom of God Is
larger than the church, and the caus* of
Christ Is helped in more ways than
through the pulpit. .
I left the ministry because I believed
there are too many of us misfits in It al
ready. When the officers of a vacant
church that pays but JlOOO per year receive
thirty applications In two weeks either
dtrectly or Indirectly from men who want
that pulpit it Is time that some of us
dropped out of such a fierce struggle for
existence. This Is no Isolated case. Th<j
wire-pulling to place friends In desirable
pulpits, the methods resorted to by some
to secure destrablepulplts, are degrading
and disgusting. The true ministerâ ana
thank God there are many of thera, noble
and unselfish men, men whoare making life
sweeter by their labors and sacrifices â has
no need of doing this. The place seeks
him! He would scorn to have It other
wise. Again and again I have known
such a man to refuse flattering offers of

may be placed upon me from without.
The church would be richer and the king
dom come more quickly if some' of i:Â» t
ministers would leave it and earn an hon
est living.
I believe also that there are too
many Protestant churches, some of
which are very unwisely placed for doing
their work. If there were leas "denomi
national pride" and more love of truth:
If thera were a greater emphasis placed
on those essential things tnat make for
CnrUtian unity and less on the non-es
sential that make tor diversity; In short,
if there were really love to Christ and
loyalty to his person and aervlce in Chris
tians, the (Ussractfol condition that now
obtains would not exist, 'lhtnk of a com
munity of less than ZOUO people represented
by from rive to ten diiferent denomina
tions and sects, each poorly attended and
ail struggling for a bare existence.' If
there wete good, common business sense*
among them, if there were a wholesome
desire to serve God in reality and not la
name only, if their purpose was to build
up an institution that stood for righteous
ness, truth. Justice and purity in social
and political life and to have it effective
and influential, think you not they would
forget the trivial dirterencts and find
a way to unite on the grand purpose of
their lives? Alas, too many of the so
called Christians want a plate wnere their
peculiar views and their peculiar people
can come together to have the emotions
tickled and their pet theories confirmed.
Let ethics and not theology, morality and
not ritual, a clean, true, manly life and
not Intellectual beliefs, the sayings of
Christ and not the opinions of theologians
âa love to God that leads to justice to our
brother manâ be taught and emphasized
by the ministers' who have heard the di
vine call and who come before the people
as the prophets of Go<l. rebuking sin in.
high and lovr places, afraid of neither rich,
nor poor, because of God's message in their
hearts, and then the great unchurched
masses would nock to the standard of the
church, for it would then be God's instru
ment to bring in the reign of righteous
ness.
I have acted very much as the man
who fell down the stairs with a precious
piece of crockery In his hands. In falling
his whole thought was for the crockery,
and ho nearly broke every bone in his
body to save it. His wife, hearing the
nol3e. ran to the head of the stairs and
seeing her husband lying in a tangled heap
at the bottom cried out. "John. John, have
you broken that vase?" "No. dâ It I
didn't but I will." and with that hÂ«
hurled' It against the wall. 1 never said
that I left the mtnlstry because thÂ»
church was full of hypocrites, but the un
warranted, unjustifiable and uncharitable
attacks both in the press and out of it
with which I have bten assailed by
Christians of all denominations, and es
neciallv by their ministry, have led me to
say tome plain and harsh things. No on*
resrrets more than myselt that the church
and its ministry is open to such criticism
as I may herein have stated, and 1 trust
that this criticism may be the means of
helping to purge the church, though it
will bring contempt and anathemas upon
my head.

4THE prima donna has two duties. The one is to sing, the other is to
dress. The cost of the latter is a sum that the public wots not of.
Six thousand dollars is the amount paid by Madame Nevada for
her outfit. She paid it in Paris, where the dreams of Felix take unto them
6elves substantiality in the form of silk and lace and beaded stone combina
tions. Felix tempts and woman weakens. But in the case of Madame Nevada
the weakening was a matter of business. Willy-nilly, she was obliged to
have the gowns.
So. woman fashion, she began with the best. She did not stop buying
evening gowns until they piled up ten deep, and she and they were very happy
together until a bill put an impudent finger in the pie. 'â¢Two thousand dol
lars for the ten? Rather large, but the only way to get rid of the bill is to
pay it." she chirped. Having this little matter attended to, she proceeded to
enjoy the gowns once more.
"This turquoise gown represents almost 5400," she sighed, and grew
cheerful again as the gay little turquoises" shone at her. The double skirt
meets at the side and is clasped from waist to floor with turquoise buckles.
"Hats and gloves and shoes and wraps have to match every gown." she
said, "and think of what that means. Wraps, especially. Here, to begin with,
is the simplest of all." Â» .
It was brown broadcloth, extravagantly plain. Women will know what
"extravagantly plain" means. Men imagine that it is the flippancies that
count. And that "plain" brown broadcloth with its sable bands of trimming
was $95. .â¢â¢,.Â¦
"The sealskin was Sroo. Dear. dear, what a price! And the two opera
capes cost $300. and the two short capes $150. Just a lot of old animals'
skins, after all. The seal and the mink and the rest of them never guessed
their value, did they?"
One by one the afternoon gowns were produced. Five, they are, and
$150 each is an average of their cost.
"All done â except the four carriage gowns," she said. "How much?
Eighty dollars each. Do you like them? They are rather pretty. I love
them all; as I love beautiful painting?, but oh, the trouble of them."
The maid waited at the door. "There are trunks to pick," she said. ,
"Eight."

V, I but In my defense lam prepared
X to swear that the ends of Justice
were fully met by the course I
adopted, and that my conscience acquits
me of all blame In the sequence of events
that followed my accepting the position, of
steward to Sir John Thynr.e,
Sir John had been an old friend cf my
family, und when, after the disasters by
which my father's fortune had been Irre
trievably wrecked it behooved me to seek
some employment, the kindly old baronet
cJTered me a house and a good Income in
return for my supervision of his estate.
It Is needless to tay the offer was one
which I acepted thankfully, and In a
week's time from the receipt of his letter
1 -was at Ravenscourt.
The room to which I was conducted was
In the right wing, and I found Sir John
lying on a couch beside the fire, a changed
man, co far as looks were concerned, from
the jovial fellow I remembered him 10
have been in the old days when he came
visiting to my father's house. The doctor
was with him, a quiet, observant man,
who regarded me attentively as I stood
holding his patient's hand.
"Paton will have It that I am not ill."
laid Sir John, attempting to assume his
former merry voice. "Cut I know bert
about that." Â»
"At any rate, you are not seriously 111,
E'.r John," answered the doctor, "and we'll
soon have you about again."
I made some stereotyped reply, wishing
him speedily restored to his usual health
and regretting his illness; and then our
conversation went Into Its natural chan
nel, which was about the estate and the
need for certain Improvements to bo made
upon it.
"I'll be having to think of others now."
Faid Sir John. ''My term of life Is nearly
m an end, and I would wish to leave the
place more valuable than when I came
into posyssion of It."
"There'll be time enough for talking
like that. Sir John," I answered, "twenty
years hence." But he shook his head,
paying something in an undertone that I
did not catch.
"Tou'3l <Jine here to-night," he said.
"I'm eorry I shan't be able to come down
stairs. There will be only three of you,
and I should like to hare a word with you
ajraia before you leave."
Blr John pressed me to star, and al
though 1 was reluctant to do so, not
having come prepared for dining, I finally
gave my consent. Ab we were speaking
the door opened and a man whom I had
not hitherto seen came into the room.
"This Is my nephew, Mr. Charles FÂ«o
ton." said Blr John, introducing the new
comer. "And this is my new steward. Mr.
Kpencer. There'll be a good many things
he'll be glad of your help in, Charles, and
now that I'm laid by you must take my
place."
Mr. Fenton favor

There was bo me- \<j!^W
thing in his look N?Sr>Â£3Â»
and manner that re-
peiled me. and with
the briefest cour- Sj
teey I resumed my
conversation with Elr John. I could
not resist forming a comparison be
tween the two men, uncle and nephew, the
one the very ideal of an English gentle
man, the other a supercilious fellow
whom I distrusted instinctively. I marked
his sleek manner and the tone of voice in
which he inquired after the invalid's
health had an Insincere ring. I noticed
too that his bands were remarkably well
formed, film as a woman's, with perfect
filbert nails, and that he waÂ« inordinately
vain of them was evident. With a casual
remark he turned on his heel, and a feel
ing of relief came over me as he quitted
the room.
For the better understanding of the
erents that happened at Ravenscourt it is
necessary that I describe rather minutely
the room in which Blr John lay. The walls
were of paneled oak. and at the end of
the room where the great carved bedstead
Ptood was a picture dusky with age, set
in an antique frame. This covered sev
eral of the panels, the edge of Itâ that
farthest from the doorâ overhanging the
melding of the wall, making a striD of
black shadow. Why I noticed this I can
not say, but It caught my eye and ap
peared to form' a conspicuous feature In
the lov/ pitched room. Between the bed
stead and the picture (the space might
have been about four feet) was a email
table, on which were set some books, a
glass and a small phial, such as is used
for medicine. 5 ? ordinarily. The table was
within easy reach of the bedstead; that
with its hangings and ponderous canopy
loomed out massively from the distance,
and opposite this was the latticed window.
Taken altogether. Sir John's room was a
forbidding-looking place, where dusky,
weird shadows crept and hovered in thÂ©
miFty light. â¢
"You will find Paton a very pleasant fel
low." said Sir John, "a little reserved at
first maybe, but it won't take long to
thaw him." And he made another effort
to seem cheerful, though it was not suc
cessful.
With a promise to Fee him again I quit
ted the room, going out Into the gloomy
corridor, toward the staircase, and as I
paused for an instant in the seml-dark
r.<?f-s a door was suddenly opened at the
end of the corridor and a woman came to
ward me carrying a lighted lamp, the
sheen of which was uDon her face â a face
more beautiful than 1 had ever seen he
fore, a sweet, pale face, that bore a
stranpo look of distress, and in her eyes
were traces of tears. She was dressed 'n
come description of white, gauzy material
that shimmered in the light and added a
grace and charm to her, which for a mo
ment hold me speechless. When I did
speak it was to make a rather clumsy
apology for my presence there, and at this
a. look as of some half-forgotten meiTi
ment sprang Into her eyes. Then their
former appearance returned, the look as
of pome hunted animal, and she cast a
plance over her
shoulder, as though
listening. The ac
tion seemed as If it
were an habitual
one, and for the
time I forgot every- ~d Â«Â¦
thing else but the
beautiful troub led
face of the girl,
whose tear-dimmed
eyes were to haunt irr
me for many a long *~ ill
day. /Â£s*.
I think I was wait- <wt ;

voice, but there was 4/M
no reply to my ex- VeiÂ« \s
planation, and with ' j^S*
a Bcarrely perceived

1 head she had passed me, going into
i Sir John's room. It was with an unusual
- sense of loneliness that I made my way
i downstairs, finding Dr. Paton alone In the
! dining-room.
"I am sorry to find Sir John en Invalid."
"I am content to put up with all that,
now," I answered. Then with that strange
glance over her shoulder, she hurried
away, leaving a blank In my life which
only she could fill.
It is not my intention to describe the
course of love-making nor the scene In
which I learned from Margaret's lips tho
cause of her unhappiness. That Fenton
loved her in his boorish fashion I did not
doubt, but the engagement between her
self and Sir John's heir had been forced
upon her. I heard also that his Jealousy
was so great that she was virtually a
prisoner at Ravenscourt, and that since
Sir John's illness his nephew's tyranny
had passed all bearing.
"Every action of mine Is watched" she
told me. "I am reviled and insulted con
stantly and I am helpless to prevent It."
"Will you give me the right to protect
you?" I asked earnestly. T 'To save you
from this fellow."
The look that answered. me made me
the happiest man in the three kingdoms
at that moment. The next I was con
fronting Mr. Charles Fenton, who had
burst through the hedge beside which
Margaret and I were standing, his face
livid with rage.
I need not repeat all the vile abuse with
which he assailed me. His words were
not for a woman's ears, least of all for
Margaret's, and at a sign from me she
walked quickly away.
Then, before I could be aware of the
fellow's Intent, he had raised his heavy
stick and felled me to the ground. When.
I had recovered my dazed senses I was
alone.
Two events followed In quick succession
It Is a curious fact that the roots and
branches of a tree are so alike in their
nature that if a tree be uprooted and
turned upside down the underground
branches will take to themselves the
functions of roots, and the exposed roots

branches.
were not the most obstinate man in the
world he would have gone"; and then, as
though the subject were one he did not
feel inclined to continue, Dr. Paton
changed the conversation. .
He told me that Mr. Fenton would In
herit Sir John's estate, and that a mar
riage had been arranged between the
young man and a Miss Margaret Ains
worth, "whom you will probably meet
later on. She is in the unpleasant posi- â¢
tion of a 'poor relation,' and has teen liv
ing at Ravenscourt since the death of her
father some years ago," he added.
"I think we have met already," I an
swered. "It must have been Miss Ains
worth whom' l saw In the corridor as I
left Sir John's room Just now. I hope her
marriage will be a happy one."
"I doubt whether there is any love in
the engagement," replied the doctor dryly.
"These marriages of convenience i rarely
have that Ingredient In their composition.
Mr. Charles Fenton is certainly not tho
man I should like to . have for a son-in
law. The engagement is another of Sir
John's whims, and nothing would alter
his determination."
"Miss Ainsworth gave me the Impres
sion of being unhappy," I continued.
"Can you wonder?" replied the doctor,
"when her future husband treats her bad
ly already?"
Our conversation was Interrupted at this
moment by .the entrance of Mr. Fenton,
and we sat down to dinner. During the
nephew's honor. It would be madness for
Miss Ainsworth to break off her engage
ment with him and marry a penniless
man. I have her welfare at heart, and
I trust you will not think I am reflecting
on you. Mr. Spencer."
I had said all that I considered neces
sary and so held my tongue after this.
I had business to consult him about, but
I was in no mood for doing that at the
time, and observing that our interview
had distressed him. and that his weak
ness was more marked than formerly, I
quitted the room. Our conversation had
been on the whole a friendly one, and Sir
John had made it clear to me that he re
gretted the circumstances which would
end our connection. He held my hand for
a moment, promising to help me In the
future for my fathers sake.
Dr. Paton was In the hall as I descend
ed to, it, and he took me aside, speaking
In a serious undertone.
"My patient has developed symptoms
that have made me anxious," he said "I
cannot explain In what way now, but I
should be glad If you would remain with
himâ ln his roomâ until he is asleep to
night. Make an excuse for doing so."
"I would do that willingly were It not
for the chance of meeting Mr. Fenton,"
I answered.. "I have an account to settle
with that gentleman which must be paid
elsewhere.
"Fenton has gone up to London to
day," was the reply, and hearing this I
gave my consent at once.
Business was my excuse for prolonging
my second visit to Sir John. He had re
tired to bed early, saying that he was
tired, and I sat beside him until his at
tention flagged apd his eyelids closed in
Bleep. He had forgotten his sleeping
draught, I noticed, and lay slumbering
quietly. Moving softly from the bedside
to the fireplace, I seated myself, my face
being in the direction of the bed and
dim shadowy recess that was between
the' sleeper and wall. There was an eerie
fascination in the grim features of the
painted woman, something ghastly in the
pallid eagerness with which she glared
at me from out the moldering frame:
and sitting there in the dead silence of
the night, my thoughts were busy with
the memories of the past few days. So
still was it that when a sound came,
the sound that a rat gnawing at the oak
floorboards might have made, I started
and half rose from my chair. The sound
had come from the direction of the cor
ner, and glancing toward It, tha sinister
leasly backward to the tin* at black by
the frame I had seised It at the bony
wrist and held it firmly. I could feel tho
writhing effort it made to release Itself,
and the quick beating of the pulse, and
my grip tightened. It was a hand that
I would have sworn to out of a thou
sandâthe hand of Mr. Charles Fenton.
"What Is the matter? What has hap
pened?" and Sir John was sitting up In
his bed, asking me the question In a rapid
voice.
I pointed with my disengaged hand to
the helpless fingers in my grasp. "Do
you recognize this ring. Sir John?" I ans
wered quietly.
"It is the one I gave my nepbenr re
cently," he gasped. "Good heavens, what
Is the meaning of this awful mystery?"
"I think I can tell." I replied. "Shall
I release my hold?" and then his glance
fell on the two bottles.
"Yes." he muttered faintly. "I be* of
you not to leave me this night, Mr. Spen
cer " and I gave him my promise.
The next day I sent the bottle, the con
tents of which tallied In appearance with.
Dr.. Paton's harmless sleeping draught, to
an eminent analyst, and In due course re
ceived his report. The potion was pois
oned, the drug employed by the would
be murderer being of the subtlest nature
that would have done Its work slowly but
surely.
At Sir John's request I showed him the;
report, and a mournful sigh escaped him.
but no word of anger or reproach. Charles
Fenton disappeared from Ravenscourt,
and his secret was never divulged. I
made a careful examination of the house,
discovering a passage leading to the bed
room, the existence of which even Sir
John Thynne himself had not known.
He made a new will, leaving everything
to Margaret Ainsworth, who three
months after Sir John's happy restora
tion to health became my dear wife, and
I continued my stewardship. Dr. Paton
never fails to congratulate himself upon
his success In. his treatment of his puzz
ling case, and only his patient and I
know how little credit is rightfully the
doctor's due.
I said, as- we stood
chatting on the
hearthrug. "What
Is he suffering
from?"
"It hardly does for
a medical man to
confess himself puz
zled," ;was the reply,
"but bo far as the
actual evidences of
disease are con
cerned there are ab
solutely none. That
he Is not in a nor
mal state of health
cannot be denied, or
that his symptoms are disquieting, but
at present I am not prepared to ascribe
his complaint to a definite cause. Did
you notice that bottle by his bedside?"
I nodded my head.
"It contains a sleeping draught," he
continued, irritably. "Sir John has con
tracted the pernicious habit of using them
nightly, and, contrary to my advice, per
sists In taking them. Up to recently he
had them prepared by a chemist in the
town, but I have persuaded him to use
one of my prescriptions, which is as harm
less as water."
"With the result that you find his
health improving," I said.
"On the contrary." replied the doctor.
"I find his health slowly and steadily de
clining. In a word Sir John's illness Is not
to be accounted for, and I am puzzled."
"Possibly a change of air would be ben
eficial," I suggested.
"That has been my advice, and If he
meal I was ignored by the young man,
and all my attempts to Join in the con
versation were met in the cold, insolent
fashion, which I had before remarked,
and which increased my first dislike of
him to positive abhorrence.
"And that Is the future husband of Miss
Ainsworth," I muttered between my teeth
as I walked homeward. "Poor girl, you
deserve a better fate than that!"
It was a week before Margaret Ains
worth and I met again, but in the interval
my pity for her had grown to love. Her
image was ever in my mind, those tearful
eyes so sweet and gentle always before
me: and when I was returning to the cot
tage one afternoon, and we encountered
unexpectedly, an irrepressible impulse
caused me to arrest her footsteps.
"Yes, I have heard of you, Mr. Spencer,
from my uncle," she said. "I hope you
will like Ravenscourt, in spite of its being
so dull and wretched."

verbally and It was easy to see that it

me but it would be better if -we parted,
and I accepted the decision without a

attachment Is mutu al- , ? ...
"Are you aware that Miss Ainsworth Is
already engaged to my nephew?" he an
"Thank heaven, I shall save her from

for we find that the armor and helmet
worn by the ancient Japanese warrior is
much too large and far too heavy for
any Japanese of this century. Since the
restoration of peace and the solid estab
lishment of the feudal system by Shogun
in. 1400 A. D. and Its continuance for 300
years, the people have been giving too
much thought to rites and ceremonies
and have been neglecting the more neces
sary natural exercises for the symmetrical
development of the body. The Japanese
are sclll too ceremonious for this busy
world at this present age. They attend
far more to bowing and congratulating
each other than to the business that
should bn attended ta.
IHAVE been asked to compare . the
people of Japan with the American
people from a physical standpoint.
The American people are tall, while
the Japanese are generally of a
diminutive stature. Why are the
Japanese so small? Because the develop
ment of the body is greatly Influenced by
the surroundings and mode of living, and
not by the quality of food as is generally
supposed. The Japanese love everything
email and pretty. They live In little
houses with low ceilings; they bend their
knees and sit on cushions Instead of
chairs, which naturally prevents the cir
culation .of blood in the body. The Jap
anese were well formed in oldan time*.

the cup to him, filled it with wine and
made the fourth boy.'. Then I went to the
second guest and repeated the samÂ«
thing and made the same number of
bows; 'then I went to the third guest and
so on until I had finished with the
hundredth or last guest. Now I had
already made 400 bows and when the
guests took their leave I made two bows
to each one, making 200 more bows.
During the conversation with the guests
after dinner I think I made about 100
bowsâ in all I bowed 700 times that even
ing. On the following morning I was
sick with a headache and I was also the
possessor of a stiff neck."
The Japanese women are generally small
and prefer the low shoulder and narrow
*aist. The hli-h class of Japanese women
inine robe of the ancient Greeks is very
artistic, attractive and exceedingly grace
ful, but I do not think it adapted to the
needs and taste of the woman of the nine
teenth century, except on the stage or at
a- fancy ball. â¢
The Japanese women get a very small
amount of exercise practicing their ac
complishments. Dancing is an accomplish
ment of the lower classes, but is consid
ered vulgar among the higher classes.
Some time ago dancing was introduced in
the best society, but was denounced aa
improper and therefore abolished.
The higher classes of Japanese women
are taught the art of preparing tea or
"chanol," which does not simply mean to
prepare a cup of tea for dinner or supper,
but it Is a ceremony, and the women prac-
are educated in a purely Oriental way.
Their manner ot dressing' and mode of
binding their hair, bodily movement or
manner of walking are entirely different
from those of the American woman. The
Japanese woman looks" very beautiful and
graceful in her flowing silken gowns, with
elaborately and beautifully colled hair,
ornamented with golden Jewels. The
movement of the body is natural and
graceful and Is greatly admired by the
foreign traveler.
A few years ago the European dress
Tva.3 Introduced among the Japanese wo
men in public places and t gatherings. I
noticed on several occasions the Japanese
women dressed in European style and
they looked most grotesque. They could
hardly walk in their tight shoes and
could scarcely breathe in their tightly
laced corsets. This , custom proved ad
vantageous to the doctors, who had to
be called In frequently to attend case 3 of
fainting and cardiac palpitation. Gradu
ally they realized the mistake of this
hasty change of their costumes and long
lamented and nursed their sore chests
end shrunken feet. Thus, at present, the
European costume has entirely disap
peared in Japanese society of the middle
classes and the women are glad that they
ere once more free from the horrible tor
tures of too much civilization. The court
dress of the Japanese women Is still that
of the Western style.
"While it is almost the universal opinion
Â»of foreigners that the costumes of the
Japanese women are too graceful and
beautiful to exchange for the costumes of
any other nation, yet the use of dress is
not merely to please the eye of the
Stranger, or those .of the opposite sex. but
It must be convenient and comfortable
to the Individual herself. For comfort
and for good health the dress of the Japa
nese woman far exceeds that of the West

of walking and sitting in the parlor must
be graceful. The movement of the arms
and hands, the delicate motions of the
fingers in handling the cups and prepar
ing the tea is done according to fixed
rules. It requires long practice to be
skilled in this branch of art. and it has
the effect of making the women gentle

The manner of holding the cup and
drinking the tea after it is made also re
quires practice, and every guest should be
acquainted with the same before accept

all the accomplishments of the Japanese
woman are designed to make her calm,
quiet and graceful. She has her own
manner of walking, her own manner
of speech, and in all other ways her
manner is entirely different' from that of
the other sex or from the manners of
the "three Htile maids" in "The Mikado."
If a Japanese lady should look at a lady
bicyclist attired in b!oomers riding gayly
along at the speed of ten knots per hour
I think she would surely faint. No. Jap
anese women are too home-loving, and
therefore they greatly neglect out-of-door

thing that appears to be masculine or
bold.
Sir George Grey and
the Maori Chiefs.
As the ruler of New Zealand, problems
in regard to recalcitrant natives continu
ally arose before Sir George Grey, the fa
mous Colonial Governor, problems which
could be settled by no custom of diplom
acy, Sir George solved them by good
sense.
One improvement of prime importance
was the development of roads. This was
bitterly opposed by some of the savago
tribes.

"When the old fel
low had begun to get
frail and ill." said Sir George. "I sent
him a pretty pony and trap. The seashore
at his part of New Zealand, offered a
splendid stretch of firm sand, one of thÂ«
finest drives in the world. Delighted with
his carriage, he would use it; only a
breadth of rough land intervened between
his dwelling anil the beach. He could not
"drive across it. so what does hÂ© do but
turn out his men to make a roadway?
"There was merriment in Maorlland at
the idea that Ranglhaeta. hitherto sternly
opposed to our road?, should himself be
constructing one. That was as I hoped,
and he made no more dlfflcutlles for us.
How could he? There he was. almost
every afternoon, driving on the sands In
all the pride of peacock feathers."
Sir George's tact was always In evi
dence. As a young man he had noticed
the respect which savages pay to strength
and agility.
"I was somewhere on the coast with
several of my officers and a number ot
Maori chiefs," he said afterward, "and
there was a debate as to running. I ven
tured the statement that T could, perhaps,
beat the Maoris at a distance contest.
They selected their best man, a young
chief, and I fancy it took me more than
half a mile to get away from him."

Cartoons by a Japanese Artist.
Concerning Dr. Moriyama,
Who Proposes
to Dissect Us
Both Socially
And Politically.
AMERICANS in general, and
Califomians in particular, have
jaunted in Japan for three
weeks and then written three
folio volumes on picturesque Japan
and the Japanese.
Enter now on our scenes one Dr.
M. Moriyama, correspondent of the
Tokio Sun, a magazine that numbers
en its honorary staff the Japanese
aristocrats and official dignitaries of
highest degree. Dr. Moriyama will
linger among us about ninety days
and send to Japan at least nine
lengthy articles, dissecting us social
ly and politically.
The first hieroglyphics of his
quill are already on the briny way.
In a few days the slant-eyed Japan
ese aristocracy of brains and wealth
will read of the "social condition of
San Francisco and its standard of
morals."
By the twenty -one days of his visit
It is uncertain whether Dr. Moriyama
has struck bottom on this subject.
And by the spoken words of Dr. Mori
yama it is certain that his written
words do not lacquer our failings and
faults.
"The people here are very polite
en the surface, but many of them
6cÂ«n to lack true courtesy," said Dr.
Moriyaina through an interpreter,
which is very frank and refreshingly
original, for seldom, if ever, have
we been accused of being superficially
polite â it is a charge laid more fra
quently at the door of the ceremoni
ous Japanese.
"I am somewhat disappointed in
the moral standard of this city," re
peated the interpreter after Dr. Mori
yana. "The home life is not as pure
as I had expected."
Just how Dr. IToriyama managed
to get enough peeps behind the house
hold scenes to come to this conclusion
was lost in the interpretation. As a
gentleman of rare distinction and
learning he had been made the center
of the sacred inner circle of local Jap
anese society. It may be that through
these Oriental exclusives Dr. Mori
yama has been introduced to the
typical San Francisco home. How
ever his knowledge has been gleaned
he is very positive in his opinions.
Just what Dr. Moriyama has writ
ten about us to his countrymen can
not be found out until a copy of the
"Sun" is received and translated.
But Dr. Moriyama's cartoon on the
American and Japanese women gives
a hint, and also the article written
by Dr. Katsuki gives an idea of how
we stand in the light of comparison
to the educated resident Japanese.

ability, and the Magic Box

which, of course, stands for China.
Japan, represented by the insect,
remains aloof.
11. Scramble to get into the box:
111. What happens when the
box opens. This shox's Dr. Mori-
yamas idea of how the Chinese
question will be solved.- Dr. Mori
yama has spent much time in
China, studying the political prob
lems, and believes that when China
shall be pressed too hard by outside
nations the ancient or southern race
of Chinese will rise to the salvation
of their country. At present the
southern and non-ruling race is not
taken into account by the natives.
In the cartdon the ancient race is
represented by the monster (one eye
signifying that) who has in hh
clutches the northern and ruling dy
nasty. Japan is seen allying itself
with the southern Chinese. The ex
pressions nn the face of the star
(America) show Dr. Moriyama's
idea "of our position on the Oriental
question. In the first cartoon Amer

The irmiisTam:* were all disposed of, so
we left the Gaelic to go or. the dock and
watch the customs officers at work In
specting the baggage.
"Look here. Mr. St. John, this sounds
hollow. I believe the trunk has a false
bottom." ThÂ« words came out of a big
wood and leather affair, the contents of
which were carelessly dumped in a sort
cf pyramid beside it. There was a custom
service official stooping over the trunk,
half inside, tapping away with his finger
tips.
Mr. St. John, Deputy Surveyor of the
Port, walked leisurely round and tapped, a
little on his own accord; then the hatchet
tapped a little, too, and a splinter rame
out, disposing- a neat layer of ellk and
lace-!*. The trunk belonged to a big. bluff
passcnge:, tvho tried to explain that the
bottom was there all the time and that
the Custom-hou.ve officers could have seen
It before if they had wanted to. He had
known all about It and would have told
them if they had asked.
But the inspectors did not ccc it from
that point of view.
"Why didn't you declare th^<=e when you
were asked to name your dutiable goods?"
demanded the officer.
"I to.d you I couldn't remember every
thing I had and that you would have a
chance to lind anything I had overlooked
when it came to the examination of my
bap-gage. You liave discovered these ex
tra thlnps, and I am ready and willing to
pay thÂ«j duty on them. What more do you
want?"
The emuppler was bold and knew the
technicalities of the law. So long as there
had been no direct denial and no positive
evidence of Intentional deception he could
cot be held as a criminal.

The Last of the Royal
Pilchucks
when "Jack's" name was among the
political speakers people would corns
miles to hear him. His speeches,
clever and bright, made the opposi
tion party smart. His sarcastic humor
caused more than one man to loss a
coveted position. He could never be
bought, and if he truly thought that
some man on his own ticket was un
worthy he felt the sting of Jack's
tongue too,
His wife, the Princess Julia, is al
most as remarkable as her royal hus
band. After the Indian fashion, she
helps her husband with the work, but
the hardest part is always done by
Jr.ck. This is quite contrary to tha
usual order of things among Indians.
Jack and Julia are still lovers. Mar
ried so many years ago as to have
forgotten just when, they are as fond
of each other as though they had
been married but a ysar ago.
Their home (for they scorn to live
on the reservation) is a little hut on
the banks of the Pilchuck Creek. Tha
creek and the woods around give
them their living. In fish season
they fish for salmon. They do this
with what is called a gaff hook. It is
a large hook fastened to p. long stick,
and the fish are speared with it. Ia
clam season they dig for clams, and
in berry season gather wild berries
and sell them to the whites.
The Pilchuck Indians are a branch
of the Siwash tribe. In appearancÂ©
they resemble the Digger Indian of
the southland. Here the resemblanco
ends, for the Pilchucks are honest as
the day is long and never have givea
the whites any trouble.
"Not more than the ordinary, nor so
much," v/as the reply, "but the baggage
has all to be prone over, and the search
ing process is the same, besides other du
ties of an f>fflcial nati:re."
"Do the ladles ever try smuggling?" I
asked.
"Not as n rule," was the reply. "We
have had cases where the Inspectress had
her hands full. All the skirts, dutiable
clothing, wraps, etc.. that they can man
age to wear are legitimately theirs, but
when it comes to carrying ihlngs In the
tops of bonnets, in the soles of their
shoes and between the linings of their
dresse? we have to object, you know. We
do not usually search the women unless
there is something suspicious in their ap
pearance or deportment; in case we eus
pect them of attempted smuggling we
turn them over to an Inspectress."
Trunks were being opened, overhauled
and shut up systematically, the contents
of the sacks and valises were being dump
ed out and poured in again; cabs and
transfer wagons were waiting, or taking
them away as rapidly as they were re
leased. It war a busy time in the corral.
When things became a little quieter and
the big pile of luggage had diminished to
a few scattering items, some of the offi
cers lit cigars and became more commu
nicative.
"Wo seize baggage occasionally," eaisl
one, "but it is only when the owner has
shown his hand very plainly and there is
no chance of mistake. Seized baggage ia
kept in the hands of the Government, mid
unless it is claimed it is appraised and
sold and the money goes into the Govern
ment funds."
"There isn't much danger of its being
claimed," added another, "for the owner
is apt to consider the goods well lost If
he can keep out of prison. Sometimes
they do try the trick, though, of allowing
their baggage to be seized for delinquent
duty, and then buying it up. at the auc
tion sale."
"And what do you do if you catch them
at it?"
The officer made an eloquent gesture In
imitation of a razor rapidly drawn across
the throat, accompanied by a Bort of
"Z-l-l-p" sound. I am Inclined to think,
as a matter of fact, however, that the

M.iru, a steamer frcm Japan. As he came
down the gangplank we hastily examined
him and discovered that he was padded.
Upon special examination It was found
that he had or.c hundred and twenty
seven pieces of embroidered silk wrapped
around him. We held him for^trlal, and
his attorney dug uo evidence ><> provu
that the man had been advised by his
physician to wear bandagc3 for some dis
ease he had. The esthetic invalid, how
ever, could not prove that the prescrip
tion called for silk embroidered bandages,
and the defense was a failure."
"Do you have, to go through all this
baggage?" I asked. It was piled up all
around usâ trunks, valises, boxes, sacks
and bundles.
"We search everything that is taken to
the corral," replied the officer, "and it
all comes in here except the grips that
are searched when the rasscngers leave
the gangplank."
The "corral" was a portable fence, set
up in a square, down at the Pacific Mail
dock, and inside it was the baggage and
the passengers who had come to claim
their belongings.
"We have been very busy," said Mr. St.
John, "fcr the past two years. Joseph S.

California is still a producer of remarkable, songbirds.
Word comes from London of the success of 'a San Francisco girl, but it zcill not be a sur
prise to the many friends of Miss Lillic Laii'lor, for it is but tlic fulfillment of what every cue ex
pected when she left here barely two years ago to cultivate her voice in the best schools abroad.
After studying in London, Paris and Brussels, she has- divided her time between Paris and
London, zvhtre, through her charming personality and the remarkable timbre of her voice, she has be
come a conspicuous figure in both the social and artistic zvorlds.
It is but another example of the popularity of the American girl abroad. Miss Laidor was one
of the most prominent of San Francisco's society belles when she decided to leave the gayctics of the
afternoon tea, dinner and ball to go to the best masters abroad and take up seriously the study of drazv
ing-room singing.
Her first appearance was at one of M?s. Mackay's functions in London. Then followed rap
idly other successes at the drazcing-rooms of Mrs. Ronalds, Lady IVatcrloo, Lady Hamilton, the
l T iscouniess Decrhurst and many others. But the greatest success was still to come.
Miss Lazclor has made many friends, and amons them Mr. and Mrs. H olden, whose estate,
Eastzvell Perk, at Ashford, Kent, is the second largest hunting park in England, It consists of sev
eral thousand acres and upward of 2000 deer were killed on the preserves last year. The Holdcn
House has ample accommodations for hundreds of guests, and that music is zirll appreciated is
cz'inccd by the fact that there are half a dozen grand pianos in the different drawing-rooms of the man
sion. Their house parties arc famous throughout England, and invitations to them most highly prized.
Recently the Holdcns gave a five-day hunting party in honor of the Duke of Cambridge, the first cousin
of Queen Victoria, and his sons, the Rear Admiral Fitz George and Colonel Fitz George; Miss Lazv
lor zvas invited as Mrs. H olden s special guest.
Miss Lazvlor sang ez'ery evening, and the Duke,. scaled near the piano, enjoyed the 'singing
greatly, and his Royal Highness, as well as the other guests, complimented her most highly. It is cer
tainly very promising, this success the California songstress has in store for her, and an evidence of the
cordial good will of the English people tozvard their American cousins.

OF the abundance of Incident In
Sienkiewlcz's new novel, "The
Knights of the Cross." may well
be Bald what Dryden says of
Chaucer's exuberanceâ "Here is God's
plenty." On every page is a down
right word; on every third or fourth page
the record of a downright blow. Now the
tale tells of a hotly contested duel, end
ing with a piece of magnificent killing;
now of Instant ana" imperious love, boldly
declared; now of youth's fantastic chal
lenges as he rides about, longing to twirl
the world on his lance point; now of the
dark and bloody deeds wrought In a se
cret prison chamber, of abductions,
feasts, resc*ues, hunts, of plotting in tho
King's palace, good cheer and wrangling
in the farmer's cabin, subtle cruelty in
the monasteryâ of violence everywhere,
on the road, in the field and the wood,
in the castle and the church. The nuthor
seems never to falter or be at a loss for
action to fill bis pages. Often one ad
venture is not even completed before the
next adventure begins, and the reader
feels as if the euthor were drawing from
an exhaustless source of supply. Thu
rushing life of the tale, unconscious of
effort and heedless of economy, is as re
sistless as a force of nature.
The work is a historical novel, poi-
Iraying the obscure period when Po'aivl
and Lithuania, united under one crown
by Jaduiga's patriotic marriage, were
Ptruggling into national self-consciouÂ«ness
and unity. The book, written from th\Â»
point of view o>' a loyal Pole, deals with
the contest between this inchoate nation
and the great religious and military order
of the Teutonic Knights. These Teutonic
Knights, known frcm the black cross ;m
their white cloaks as the Knights of the
Cross, had established a government, r*pt
resented as strong and orderly, but fright
fully oppressive, or, the western confines
of Lithuania. They had converted, or,
more properly, conquered the heathen na
tives' to Christianity, and were engaged
in carrying on the same process among
tho Lithuanians. The Lithuanians, mean
time, by the marriage of their King with
the saintly Queen of Poland, had n ac
cordance with the usual summary meth
ods been obliged to turn Christian. ThuÂ«i
the Knights no longer had any excuse for
assailing them. For all that, the Knights,
who are depicted as thoroughly corrupt,
committed hideous outrages on the bor
ders, not only of half-heathen Lithuania,
but of Poland, long settled in Christian
ity. The baser Knights are portrayed as.
given over to sensual indulgence and cru
elty; the nobler to a fanatical devotion
to their order. Almost without exception
they arc completely unscrupulous, hcr>!
tating at no cruelty, deceit -or breach of
faith which seems likely to gain the-r
ends.
Against this compact organization,
6trong with all the strength of the high
est civilization of the day, and evil a3 hell
itself, is set off the great-hearted but
half barbarous Polish nation, with its
wild energy and beauty. The freedom
and pympathy with which the author
represents the barbaric character and the
rude conditions of the age give the book
itself something of a barbaric nature.
The men are of uncommon magnitude of
stature and great beauty of form. Their

and multitudes of names with k. z and v
in them make an American reader stare
and gasp. The very hero is Zbyshko.
The incidents of the novel are nearly all
inarkui by sjmethir.g of the elemental un-
COUtbness alieady hinted at. Matzko is
healrrt of his grievous wound by tirinkinr;
three quarts cf bear's fat, which oiled tIM
buried w<apon and marie it siip out. "Thj
lirst (mart MatzUo drank with pleasure,
for it was fresh, not burnt, and had th"
odor of angelica, which the g.rl. skilled
in plants, had added to the pot in meas
ure. Matzko was strengthened in spirit
at once, and received hope of recovery.
" 'That was needed,' said he, "when
everything is oiled properly; that dog
mother of an arrow point may slip oui of
me somewhere.'
"The succeeding quarts did not taste
so well to him as the first, but iie drank
because of good sense."
When the crisis was past, a splinter
from an arrow working its way through
an aLscess, ho called for fuod.
"He could not look at bear's fat, Uut
they broke up twelve eggs to be fried for
him, for through caution Yagenka would
not permit more. He ate these with relish,
together with half a loaf of bread, and
drar.k a pot of beer."
Yet it is not only the rudeness of sim
plicity which is expressed in the book.
Its beautyâ open-hearted clearness of
character, loyalty, courage, unsophisti
cated directness, the nobility of genuine
nessâtakes its rightful place as the in
spiring force of the story. Yagenka,
Brunhllde in strength, beauty and daring,
better than Brunhlkln in the generous ten
derness of her unrequited love, is a
worthy parallel as woman to Zbyshko
as man. This heady but nobly single
hearted youth makes a fine hero, for he Is
free from the Insipidity and character
lessness of the usual hero of romance.
The subject and the substance of "The
Knights of the Cross" remind one of an
other Slav storyâ the prose epic of "Tarass
Bulba." "Tarass Bulba" possesses the
same strange union of uncouthness and
heroism, but differs from "The Knights
of the Cross" in Its more compact unity
and ir.tenser fire. Both seem more gt-nu
ine, less sentimentalized than, for exam
ple, Scott; both tempt one to draw unfa
vorable comparisons with Homer's noble
manner of dealing with similar subjects.
Although "The Knights of the Cross" la
so rich In incident, the outline of thestory
so far as it has appeared is extremely
clear and simple. Indeed, when a reader
stops to think of the story he is surprised
to find how panoramic a view of the place
and time has been given so simply. The
author seems purposely to have depleted
all ranks of society and all phases of life.

of justice, the meeting of chivalry with
the untutored wildness of the half-savage
races, the methods of the religious or
ders, the dress and domestic habits of the
porlod. are all depicted casually as part
of a story which never becomes conscious
or didactic. Of the accuracy of the pic
ture very few are competent to judge and
as a work of literature the novel may be
from rhe truth as far as the south pole
from they north poL? and lose not a jot
of its merit. The history of a historical
novÂ«-I is the least significant of its ele

world he has added a new world to his
reader's wealth, as precious if in Fairy

Devon.
It is not likely that the new book will
oxeite uo much popular interest as "Quo
Vadirx." The period of "Quo Vadis" is
one about which many readers have a
natural curiosity to begin with, and it of
fers an opportunity for brilliant con
trasts, great variety and descriptions of
alluring beauty. In "The Knights of the
Cross" the historical period is little
known: one might say totally unknown
without great exaggeration. The subject
presents far fewer opportunities for va
riety of incident than does the subject of
the earlier novel. As a matter of fact,
the incidents, though vivacious ar.d bril
liant, are In a sense very much of one
type ; Nor is any of them so original in
inspiration as the struggle of Ursus with
the bull, the death of Petronius, or the
burning of the Christian martyrs. This
is not to pay that the scenes are not of
thrilling Interest. The death of the bear
and the ax duel between Zbyshko and
Rotgier are marvelously vivid. The
strange horror of Â¦ the soft footsteps in
the wood, where foul spirits abounded;
the later coming of the bear, the man
ful attack on the great beast with only
a barbed fork and an ax for weapons, and

, "How often does the stork pay visits to
the basket under the steps?" I asked.
"He comes pretty often." Miss Carter
replied; "one, fwo, three, sometimes four
and five times a week. We had fifty-five
babies on hand last weekâ only forty-six
now. People come and adopt themâsome
times they are claimedâ and then you

them come with nothing at all."
"Do you ever see the people who bring
them?" I queried.
"No. we do not look for them; we do not
wish them to fear seeing us or being seen.
It Is our purpose to save the babies, and
they would not be brought here to be

â¢4 V EAR the side door of San Fran
/\ I Cisco, in the shadow of the hill
I \J that is the wooded background of
I y the Affiliated Colleges, lives John
Slocum, with his four motherless
daughters.
John Elocum is a carpenter by trade,
find the neat little wooden nest that
houses his brood would prove him a good
one. But the gossip <>f the fe-w neighbors
who scantily fringe that side of the hill
whispers that it was a girl's strong right
erm that sawed and hammered and nailed
a pile of lumber into a cottage.
Rumor is rot awry. It was Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of the house of Slocum,
who In overalls and jumper built the
home. When the lr.st nail was driven her
lather Raid "Good:" and Elizabeth Slo
cum wasÂ» a carpenter by brevet.
The neighbors have it, moreover, that
Â¦11 the Slocum girls are being taught
boys' trades. Mrs. Grundy put on her
bonnet and called on Slocum per<\ Mrs.
Grundy told him that girls were intended
to be seamstresses or typewriters or shop
frirls, and not carpenters or blachsmiths.
Mr. Slocum laughed and said "Non
eense!" and went on bringing up his
children to the best of his beliefs and
convictions. Boilod into a sentence, his
theory is. that a trade that is good for a
boy is good for a strcng girl.
It was Miss Elizabeth Slocum herself
who opened the door to a Sunday Call re
porter. This "carpenter," who has set
the hillside agog, looks IS, but confesses
20 years. She is tall and wc-11 rounded:
blue woolen sleeves rolled back showed
above the ring of sunburn a pair of line
arms and neat elbows. Miss Elizabeth's
eyes are brown and direct, and looked the
surprise which punctuated her speech.
"From the newspaper? "Why, what have
we done that we should be written up?
"You would like to see the house that I've
built? Why. certainly." and Miss Eliza
beth led the way. A simple little five
room house It is, planned for comfort, yet
with an eye to beauty and full of delight
ful surprises. The burlap hangings on
the wall !n the living-room slide on bam
boo rods and reveal two folding beds built
right into the wall. The hangings on the
ether sides conceal the chests of drawers
end closet room. Not a bulge or wrinkle
In the burlap suggests that at night this
pretty living-room does the presto
change into a comfortable bedroom for
two of the girls.
The "ohs" and "ahs" of genuine delight
prepared the way for a leading question
and warmed Miss Elizabeth's heart. They
were to this young carpenter what a
rmack of the lips is to the cook, for
whether a woman bake a cake or build
a house, she delights In praise thereof.
"Yes," answered Miss Slocum, "father
Is going to have the other girls taught
boys' trades. I don't think he wants any
more caipentors in the family; he's one
himself, you know, and two in one fam
ily are enough. Anna and Kate are still
et grammar school, but they'll graduate
this year, and then they'll have to decide
what trade they'll follow. Lucy is only
eeven, so she has plenty of time. Kate
wanted to be a milliner, but father won't
hear of a girl's trade for her. Anna says
ehe'll do anything that'll keep her out of
doors.
"Anna's latest idea is that she's going
to be a painter. She's big and strong and
could sit at the edge of a scaffolding that
would make a man dizzy. Father likes
the idea and says Anna will be a boss
painter come day. What do you suppose
she wanted to be at first? One of those
men that go around and climb poles to
fix the telegraph wires!
"You see we haven't been brought up
like other girls. We've been encouraged
to play boys' games, climb fences and
Â©HÂ£ cF.tf"iÂ£ GMs ap| E>p^rt QaYpsr\iqp*
do all the harum-scarum things that
healthy boys do. So we're not afraid of a
mouse."
Miss Elizabeth Slocum Is at the age
when most girls arc sipping their full of
the honey of girlish delights. But this
maiden of 20 cures nothing about the cut
of a gown, while the shape of a window
or size of a door is of absorbing interest
to her. A lathe and a saw in her father's
workshop were the toys of her dolly days.
When she was 12 she built a house strong
enough to defy wind and rain and large
enough for three little girls to "play lady"
In. Before sshe carno to San Francisco
Miss Slocum had built two little bunga
lows that tucked In a crevice in the Ver
mont hills, which proves that Eastern
friends had faith in her ability and Inge
nuity to build a summer home.
The Slocums came to California some
thing like a twelvemonth ago, soon after
learning that an uncle who had died here
had made them heir to a little money
and ji large lot, whereon Miss Elizabeth
built the house.
"Father was perfectly satisfied with
this house." she said. "He didn't like the
two that 1 built back East so well. This
Is a much better job, I know It myself.
Dad said 'good' when it was finished,
and that means something from him."
Miss Elizabeth, has to act as house
keeper, for their mother lies at' rest In
far-off Vermont. So perforce Miss Eliza
beth must scour knives and sweep floors
Instead of daily using the hammer and
awl. But her father says she's learned
a boy's trade, and It doesn't matter
whether she uses it every day or not.
And Miss Elizabeth looks on dust cloths
and dishpans good humoredly, for Just
as soon as the rain gives notice that It
has quit for good she is to* go to Mill
Valley to duplicate their Slocum house
with such Improvements as the country
permits.
"It's a lady who lives near here," said
the young carpenter, "who is going to
let me build it. She wants a little sum
mer home and I've a head full of ideas
that she's just delighted with. I know I
can carry them out, too. Of course, I'll
have a man to help me just as any other
carpenter would, but he'll work under
my directions. If there were any wo
men carpenters I'd employ one, but I
suppose I'll have to hire a man. ,
"It will pay me very well, and I hopÂ«
if It's a great success I'll eet chances to
build others. I'd like to make a specialty
of putting up odd little country houses
for people who can't afford to spend
much on them. You see, I do all the
planning that they usually have an archi
tect for, and that saves expense. Most
carpenters, even those that are good
workmen, can't design a house that looks
like anything but a big dry goods box."
Miss Elizabeth Slocum refused to con
sider the possibility of evolutlng from a
carpenter to an architect. "Father taught
me the carpenter's trade," she says;
"that's what I am and Intend to stay.
Only I can't help it if I have original
Ideas."
Elizabeth Slocum, carpenter. Is one ex
ample of the theory of John Slocum.
Anna Slocum, strong- of body and iron,
of nerve, a leader in all boys' games,
will take kindly to the boys' trade whick
she or her father will select.
But what of Kate who. despite het
training, wants to be a milliner? And
though little Lucy got a drum, a footbali
and a bright tin sword for Christmas,
she was found cooing to a dilapidated
rag doll.
"Which would hint that two of John
Sloeum's children will not easily adjust
themselves to his theory. It would also
seem to suggest that it's not entirely a
matter of educationâ some girls will be
girly-girly after all.
For or against, It will be Interesting to
watch the practical working out of John
Sloeum's theory that "a trade that's good
for a boy Is good for a strong glrL" At
present the odds are even.
HIS DAUGHTERS MUST LEARN BOYS' TRADES.
OUT on "Golden Gate avenue oppo

asked, leading the way. "Come In here."
A rpw of miniature white cots stood In

and there were three of them, each witn
a kicking infant on her lap. The infantile
aversion to the bath was very much and
very audibly in evidence. There were a
half-dozen or so, and the chorus was in
teresting. One little mite, all finished and
dressed up again, was curling up a row of
very red little toes to the pleasant hea*
of the grate.
"He was left about two months ago.
whispered Miss Carter, "with a note say
ing he would be claimed later, and to call
him Harold Adams."
"Sometimes they are left with notes
like that," continued she, leading oa

years old, wrinkled, aged and care-worn,
with his little skeleton face all twisted
and contorted. "He la unfortunate." said
Miss Carter. "He will be a little imbecile
when he gets big enough to be anything."
Some of them were out with the nursery
maids for an airing in the little court sur
rounded by the house. Lively little bits
of struggling humanity were cuddled In
the arms of pretty, gingham-gowned
girls, whose smiling, pleasant faces left

Is not. The fifteen young ladies, whose
duty It Is to attend the wants of the little

ering bits of valuable knowledge about
babies In general from the regular medi
cal and professional standpoint.
"Ous girls are all very happy," said Miss
Carter. "You know they are all taking
an eight months' course of training, and
the doctors fird no trouble in getting
them positions when they graduate. Peo

There was a girl once who rejected her lover with the

THE SUNDAY CALL.
HOW a man should properly proceed when the
unappreciattve Only One has rejected his pro
posal of marriage depends upon the various cir
cumstance* surrounding the case. It i-> well known
that what is one man*, embalmed beef may incapaci
tate a whole army, and it is equally certain that the be
havior which would become a rejected suitor under
$n:r.c conditions might, under others, cause him to look
like a comic valentine:
In the first place, the swain should be very sure she is
the Only One, .md then be absolutely certain he i*
sure; for at such times there are usually others, and
they arc generally in town. Sometimes the latter have
just as tempting lips, and the same sAeet curls â some
what resembling fishhook:* â on their brows. And occa
sionally the Only One has a Younger Sister, who has
been snubbed and shoved back into obscurity until she
is ready to appreciate a little good treatment and not
too proud to accept the Only One's leavincs. Herein
Having satisfied himself that She iÂ« really and truly
the Only One, the man should then weigh her negative
carefully in the palm of his hand and consider whether
or not her "no" means "yes." Many a rejected lover
has forgotten that a woman's negative is oft an affirma
tive but thinly painted over, and gone auav and be
come a misanthrope, thus entering a business which is
to-day so overcrowded that it should offer no induce
ments to an ambitious young man. Many another
young man has also failed to recognize this peculiari: v
of the feminine negative, and. trying it acain. perhani
merely to have the pitiful pleasure of rubbine salt 0:1
the back of his already lacerated feelings, cot her â such
is sometimes the result of not having sufficient sense
to let well cnouyn alone.
1 oner knew a man to propose to the same cirl
twer.ty-six times on twenty-six consecutive evening,
and be rejected every pop till the last, and then be ac
cepted with sobs of joy. And, of course, after all thst
persistence, lie couldn't very well apologize â he had to
fight. If a man tampers with it louir enough he will be
very liable to get the proposing habit fixed on him as
firmly as the liver pill habit or the justly celebrated

wedded the young woman, and in due time a son was
born to each union: and the young man grew old and
died trying to figure out what relation he was to all the
other parties in the complication, and, incidentally, to
himself. These are some -of the "other stories" which
our friend Kipling is forever threatening to tell, and
never does.
There are hundred 1 ? and thousands of happy homes in

Tugela River disaster amounted to
nearly 1000, so that he had lost
about 1700 men before the retreat
from Spion Kop. General Buller is
criticized for the form of his mes

The Lokal Anzeiger publishes a report
of an Interview with Dr. Leyds, in which
he is quoted as saying his presence in
Berlin has, nothing to do with politics,
but is due merely to the Invitation to the
diplomatic dinner which he had received
from the Imperial Chancellor. He pro

â¢ Regarding mediation. Dr. Leyds aa'.d the
Boers had no occasion to appeal to any

As to the conclusion of peace, his per

would have to return a large portion of
the territory she had seized from the
Boers, and the federal republics wouM,
of course, obtain every guarantee that not
a hair of the heads of their kinsman
would suffer. No words, he continued,

Santiago. But we did not. As a result we
did not have nippers to cut wire and we
knew nothinc about Mausers. But the
appreciation of our shortcomings only
makes us the more determined. It may be
six months and it may be a year, but
we shall achieve our object."
From the field of party strife and mili
tary criticism it is a relief to turn to an
extract from a letter of an officer at the
front, who writes:
"An orderly was bringing some water
to a wounded man lying on the ground
near me, shot through the abdomen. He
could hardly speak, owing to the dry-
ness of his mouth, but he said, 'Take it
to my pal first. He's worse hit than me.' "
After reading this one can understand
that General Buller did not slop over
when he wired, "The men are splendid."
Professor Goldwln Smith writes to the
Speaker one of the most misleading let
ters which could possibly be put before
the British public. It commences by say-
Ing:
"I suppose the donors of the Maine
thought they were paying a compliment
to America by calling It by that name,
but really they were pricking the Ameri
can conscience, as there are few things
more certain than that the Maine was
blown up by the ignition of the coal in
her^ bunkers. The same accident has
happened to three American vessels since,
one of them commanded by the same cap
tain of the Maine, though in these cases
the vessels were saved. Nothing is more
certain than that the Maine was not
blown up by the Spaniards."
There is more in the same strain, in
cluding as proof of his contention the
remark, "No more now is heard of the
monument which waa to be erected to
the crew of the Maine."
The Saturday Review strikes a bold de
fiance of the majority of the English cor
respondents in America by declaring that
"the general feeling in America Is by no
means with us in this matter (the war),
whatever its better informed units may
think."
So deep has the military craze taken
root that swell . dinner parties are now
using khaki tablecloths, with bright red
flowers placed in Imitation of cavalry
boots. .
Following Reports Concerning
the Predicament and Heavy
Losses Sustained by Buller's
Forces, a Meeting of the De
fense Committee Is Held.
Ministers Said to Have De
cided to Order White to Sur
render Ladysmith.
LONDON, Jan. 27.â The Defense Committee of the
War Office met this afternoon, Lord Salisbury pre
siding. There arc reiterated rumors that the grav
est kind of news from Natal is being concealed by
the War Office. It is even said that General Buller's
forces are in full retreat.
BERLIN, Jan. 27. â Some of the papers here claim
to have a telegram from Pretoria saying that Gen
eral Warren was enticed into Spion Kop, where the
Boers fell upon him; that seventeen of his cannon
were captured, and that Buller's hasty retreat over
the Tugela River alone can save him. The alleged
Pretoria telegram adds that the British losses were
800 men killed and 1500 wounded. The dispatch
comes through Brussels and does not receive much
credit in this city.
It is said that the German Foreign Office has con
firmation of the report that General Warren's di
vision has been crushed.
LONDON, Jan. 28. â An ] Colonel Plumer was there and
anxious England is still ; that his troops, not the Boers,
without any elucidation of j were patrolling in the neighbor
the Spion Kop mystery. Once ; hood of Mafeking. Gaberones is
more at a time of special tension
one of the South African cables
has broken down, and conse
quently news can be expected
only in driblets and very much
belated. Meanwhile all sorts of
strange rumors reach here from
continental sources. One of
these says that General Warren
was lured upon Spion Kop and
that he lost seventeen guns. The
War Office has heard no such re
port and the story may be dis
missed as a fabrication, the only
foundation for which is the
wishes of its authors.
A Boer dispatch dated Mod
der Spruit, on the Upper Tugela
River, previous to the seizure -of
Spion Kop, reports an attempt
of the British, with a force of
forty thousand men, to force a
way by the Spion Kop route to
Ladysmith. The firing on Gen
eral Botha's position on Monday
is described as having been so
tremendous as to dislodge the
very rocks.
In view of the apparent im
passe in Xatal it is reckoned as
probable that the relief of Lady
smith may be effected by means
of the continued action of strong
columns, operating from the
western and northern borders of
Cape Colony.
It is clear that Lord Methuen's
column is straining in the leash.
Generals French and Gatacre are
getting into touch. In all like
lihood General Kelly-Kerny and
Gene r al Tucker will soon con
centrate their divisions at De Aar
and Xaauwpoort respectively.
It is thought in military circles
that if General Gatacre is rein
forced by a brigade and General
French by a division and a com
bined movement made from
Modder River, frcm Orange
River camp and on Springfon
tein, by way of Colesberg and
Norvals Pont, the situation
would be cleared at once. This
would, in fact, be a reversion to
the original plan of campaign.
Important news, if it can be
relied on, comes from a Boer
source through Lourenzo Mar
quez, to the effect that Mafeking
was relieved last Tuesday. ' If
this is so it can, of course, be due
only to Colonel Plumer. It will
be remembered that a fortnight
ago some account was n'ven as
to Colonel Plumer's progress.
On the 17th news reached this
country from Gaberones that
only about one hundred miles
from Mafeking. Therefore it is
quite possible for Colonel Plumer
with his Rhodesian regiment to
have covered the distance in six
days.
Betore the receipt of this news
from Lourenzo Marquez a report
to the same effect had gained
currency in this city. One thing
is certain, the War Office has not
received such news. Therefore
nobody is inclined to put too
much credence upon it, although
as it has been known that the
Boers have lately been trekking
east and south to the aid of more
important operations in these di
rections it is thought quite pos
sible that the siege has been
raised.
ALLEGED ORDER TO
SURRENDER LADYSMITH
NEW YORK", Jan. 27.â A World special
from London says: This has be*n the
blackest day England has experienced,
even in this gloomy period. The only ray
of lfght in it has been the report by way
of Lourenzo Marquez, on good Transvaal
authority, that Mafeking was relieved last
Tuesday
Of course the profound^st pecr^cy was
ohpen-ed concerning the deliberations of
the Committee of National Defense of the
Cabinet, which held a most important
meeting at the War Office this afternoon.
But penitent and seemingly well ground
ed rumors in the military clubs this even
ing declare that Gonrral White, In Lady
emith, has hellographed that his plight
Is desperate. And these reiterated reports
declare that the Committee of National
Defense decidr-d to order White to surren
der Ladyemith. The committee was driven
to this determination, it is declared, both
by humane considerations and as an act
of policy, that the surrender might pre
vrnt a further drain on General Buller's
defeated and demoralized army.
This report is given with reserve, but it
may bo stated emphatically that the ten
sion here is so terrible that even this hu
miliating surrender would relieve it and
the hope would be that It might allow a
raaical reorganization of the campaign
and put an end to Buller's futile squan
dering of blood and treasure in a forlorn
hope.

WHITE WILL ACT,
BUT NOT OFFICIALLY
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.-It developed
to-day that the statement made by Mon
tague White relative to diplomatic rep
resentation of the Transvaal was based
upon a dispatch he had received from
Dr. Leyds the Boer agent in Continental
Europe. When Mr. White arrived here
he found the Impression prevailing that
Dr. Leyds had been received by only one
Government of Europe. Though certain
that the other nations had received him
he determined, before making an official
statement, to obtain confirmation of his
belief from Dr. Leyds, and accordingly
cabled him with the result that he was
informed that Germany, France, Holland
and Belgium had accepted him as the
diplomatic representative of the Trans
vaal. Mr. White Is satisfied that the re
ception of Dr. Leyds by European Gov
ernments disposes of the theory that this
Government could not receive him be
cause of suzerainty over the Transvaal
conferred upon Great Britain by the
treaty between the two States. There is
no expectation in official circles that Mr
White will try to be received, in view of
his assertion to the President and Secre
tary Hay that he did not desire an official
reception and had no credentials. His an
nouncement leaves him free to take action
in any way he desires ac a private lndi-
news Issued by the War Office during the
night is a dispatch from Lord Roberts,
dated yesterday (Saturday), stating that
the situation is unchanged and that Gen
eral French reports a reconnoissance of
the enemy's position on Thursday, when
he found the Boers strongly posted at
Plctfonteln. The maps do not show any
such place in the region of General
French's operations, and it is probable
that Reitfontein, ten miles north of Coles
berg is the place alluded to.
A special dispatch from Colenso, dated
Wednesday, January 24, says that Com
mandant Lucas Meyer's commando sur
prised and surrounded a strong body of
General Methuen's Infantry, killing and
wounding twenty-three and capturing fif
teen.
Lord Dunraven, who Is chairman of the
committee having in charge the raising of
a force of mounted sharpshooters for ser
vice with the Yeomanry in South Africa,
has appealed to the public for subscrip
tions in aid of that organization. He saye
he already has 400 applicants whose shoot-
Ing records are high, and many of whom
have had experience in the bush. The
amount needed is Â£20,000, of which Â£2000
has already been subscribed.

CHICAGO PEOPLE
WILL AID THE BOERS
CHICAGO. Jan. 27.â A mass-meeting of
nearly 30C0 people In Central Music Hall
to-night inveighed against wars and ex
pressed sympathy for the Boers in their
struggle against Great Britain. The meet
ing was under the auspices of the women
of the Holland Society, who are raising
funds for the Red Cross work In the Boer
army.
D. J. Schuyler, who Is president of the
Holland Society, was the first speaker.
While he was speaking the Boer colors
were carried down the hall and were
cheered on their way to the platform.
Then John Brower sang the national
hymn of the Afrikanders, "Het Volks
reid."
Dr. Emll G. Hirsch made an address on
the horrors of war. He said that Eng
land's position was the outgrowth of a
rude and naked spirit of greed.
A double quartet of women sang the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic," the audi
ence rising to join In the chorus.
Mrs. Henry Avery of the Red Cross So
ciety made a few remarks, and other ad
dresses were made by. Miss Jane Adams
and Mrs. Vandalla Varnum Thomas. The
closing speech waa made by Jenkln Llloyd
money Is absolutely required England has
more to pay. New York and Berlin are
not greatly affected by the fluctuations,
although they feel them to a certain de
gree. Presuming that England requires
thirty millions sterling, she can secure It
without any upheaval or serious effect on
America,"
Jones, who presented resolutions which
were adopted unanimously, declaring that
the South African republics are fighting
for the same eternal principles that
moved our forefathers In their struggles
against England a century ago and tKat
the hearts of the American people are
with them In their brave and righteous
effort to preserve their country and their
homes from an Invading foreign foe.
Several thousand dollars was raised
through the sale of seats and collection
and It will be devoted to fitting out a hos

LONDON, Jan. 27.â Joseph Chamberlain.

the Birmingham jewelers and silversmiths
this evening, waa unable to be present
owing to the holding of a meeting of the

by the Hon. Jesse Collings. Under Secre
tary of State for the Home Office, and J.
Austen Chamberlain, Civil Lord of tho
Admiralty.
The former, replying to a toast to "Her
Majesty's Ministers," deplored the atti
tude of the press in regard to the war in
South Africa. He said there had been no
muddle In its conduct, and the facts
when known would show there had been
no war in which more foresight, skill
and care had been displayed by the Gov
ernment than the present one. The re
verses, he declared, only increased the
determination to prosecute the work to
the end. The war Involved the question

LIKE A REVERSE
AT DECISIVE POINT
Uoless Buller's f?rmy Is Now
Successful It Will Be in a
Perilous Position.
LONDON. Jan. 27.â Spencer "Wilkinson, whose articles on the war situation
have attracted much attention here and abroad, wrote the following re
view of the situation for the Associated Press at midnight after the War
Office had given out a telegram from Lord Roberts dated at Cape Town
Saturday, saying there was no change in the situation:
"The affair of 3plon Kop appears very like a reverse at the decisive pntnt of
the decisive battle. According to General Buller's telegram. General Warren
was determined to take the hill because it commanded the enemy's positions.
Having taken it Tuesday night, he abandoned It Wednesday night, presumably
because he was unable to hold it. The published words of General Puller's tele
gram have the tone in which a reverse is announced. Whether the mishap can be
made good it is Impossible to say. A general attacking has to some extent thft
power of making his own decisive point. General Warren may yet beat the
enemy by success at some other point or he may retake Spion Kop and keep it.
but unless one way or another the battle new going on can be won there is no
probability of Ladysmith being relieved.
"General Bullei's army, unless successful, will be in a critical position, for Its
retreat would be a difficult operation. The main Boer force is as near ta any point
on the railway as is General Warren's wing of Buller's army; and the Boers have
the advantage of speed. For this reason, rs well as because of the importance
of his purpose to relieve General White, we may expect General Buller to do
his very utmost before giving up the attempt, and in this necessity lies the best
hope of success. The American Civil War showed how rifled firearms, by render
ing assault difficult, produced battles lasting several days, an! as Â«:inc<Â» then the
range and rate of flr3 have been greatly increased the prolongation of the dura
tion of battles was to be expected. But without Â¦a â¢ fuller knowledge than the
telegrams as yet afford it is not yet possible clearly to intprprp: the ppisoiles of
the unfinished fight. The report from Boer sources that Mafeking has been re
lieved is credible, for Colonel Plumer has been persistently working in that di
rection, and there has been time since he was last heard of near Gaherons for him
to cover the intervening distance. Moreover, the Boers have wisely been concen
trating their forces at more decisive points, but it requires confirmation."
This committee, which is composed of military and naval officers holding- certain positions, met in extraordinary session yesterday afternoon, Lord Salisbury, Sir Michael
' Hicks-Beach and the Hon. Joe Cha mberlain meeting with them.

sulted in the spectacular expulsion of Mi

exciting scenes in the Chamber this was
the first time since the Dreyfus agitation
that the military has been summoned to

claimers was intended to create a wave of

Madagascar would be the first point of at
tack, has received what Is regarded here as
a confirmation In the announcement that
the Government has decided to dispatch
SCOO troops and to form a fortified camp
and arsenal at Diego Suarlez. The Gov
ernment explains that this move has no
special significance, but Is merely a part
of the already announced plan of fortify
ing the colonies. It is denied that It has
any connection whatever with Great
Britain.
English designs in Madagascar and her
rumored intention to provoke war Booner
or later is not merely, a constant cry of
"wolf" in Anglopnobe papers, but Is un
doubtedly becoming an article of faith
with the mass of the French people.
The composition of the body of troops
destined for Madagascar makes an in
novation in the svstem of reinforcing the
colonies. Instead of sending French
troops, Algerian and Soudanese sharp
shooters have beea forwarded. Hatred

Marine Hospital Laboratory Engaged
in the Manufacture of an
Antitoxin.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27.â A dispatch to the

the supervision of Dr. Walter Wyman,
the marine hospital laboratory has begun
the manufacture of a serum as an anti
toxtin for bubonic plague, to be used it
the plague should reach this country. Tat*
work was begun two months ago and it
will be four months before it is com
pleted. Dr. Wyman said to-night that hs
thought it better to be on the safe side.
The serum being manufactured is what
is known as the Versln serum, and 13 at
present the only remedy known. It dif
fers from tho preventive serum, the lat
ter having nÂ«Â» ruratlve properties. In the
preparation of the Yersin serum horses
are treated wi' increasing doses of the
toxin of the plagtie, prepared by subject*
ing virulent cultures of the bacilli to a
degree of heat which insures their de
struction. In time a certain Immunity is
conferred and the blood serum ia found
to have a decided effect in preventing inÂ»
fection. Usually the process does not stop
here, but is carried on to the production
of true antiseptic serum, preventive and
curative.
The surgeon general of the marine hos

Fifteen hundred doses of this serum were

A cam of nervous exhanstion
shows some of the symptoms of
tvery distinct nervous disorder,
and often leads to most serious
evil. In such cases there Is per-
sistent enfeeblement of neural
energy (lack of nerve force). This
lack of energy makes a tremen-
dous difference in one's life, for
the nerves regulate everything
that goes on in one's body, and
when they are poorly nourished
things go wrong.
Sleeplessness is a prominent
symptom of nervous exhaustion
and when we add to it depression
of spirits, awful forebodings
headaches (Fig. 5). emaciation
and paleness (Fig. 6). coated

nervous exhaustion are pains in

DARKNESS IN SAN JOSE.
Result of the Burning of the Electric
Plant
Social Disnatch to The Cs
SAN JOSE, Jan. 27.â The city will be
plunged in darkness for a couple of nights
owing to the burning of the Electric Im
provement Company's lighting plant,
which had the contract for lighting the
City. Business houses will also be in
convenienced during the same period and
there has been an unusual demand for
oil and lamps all day. The Electric Im
provement Company did the biggest Bhare
of the lighting of the city and nearly
every business house used its gas or elec
tric lights.
It has always been known as the cut
rate company and because of having re
duced rates- over half was very popular
with the people. All day there has been
a steady stream of callers expressing
sympathy.
Just how the flames started is a mys
tery, but It is believed to be due to an
explosion on the switchboard. The loss ia
about $100,000, half covered by insurance.
It is a miracle how the fine new gas
works were saved.
The Electric Improvement Company will
rebuild at once. The determination and
energy of Manager Edwards wai shown
this morning by a large force of men be
ing put at work to clear off ths debrla
before the ashes were cool. Two carloads
of latest Improved electric machines have
been ordered and a larger and much bet
ter plant will be built. It is asserted that
the lighting of business houses and the
city will be resumed inside of three days.
The San Jose and Santa Clara Electric
Railroad Company haa tendered the com
pany the use of Its plant and companies
from all over the State have wired all
kinds of offers.

ELECTION OF SENATORS
BY POPULAR VOTE
Poll of Governors Shows a Pronounced
Majority in Favor of the
Change.
Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â 1n order to learn
the sentiment of the people on the pro
posal now pending in Congress to so
amend the constitution as to provide for
the election of United States Senators i>>
direct popular vote, the Herald asked the
Governors of States and Territories to
give expressions of their own opinions and
tnose of their constituents.
Replies from a large number of Gov
ernors show a very pronounced public
opinion in favor of the change. This sen
timent is practically unanimous in the
South and West. In conservative New
England there is considerable open oppo
sition to any change and much indiffer
ence to the subject.
Despite the wide popular support of the
suggested amendment there Is no hope
that it will be submitted to the people by
the present Congress. The amendment
will be killed in the Senate. A majority
of the committee which must pass on it
Is opposed to the change and is supported
by the leaders in the Senate. A large ma
jority of Representatives favor the
amendment, but it cannot get before the
people for ratification except by a two
thirds vote of the Senate, and this the
Senate will not give it.
MAKERS OF STEEL

Company and Jones &
McLaughlin.
PITTSBTJRG. Jan. 27.â The Post will
say to-morrow: Slashing of prices has
been started by two of the largest steel
and iron concerns in the country. The
cuts are affecting but two of the products
and there is no danger of others being
disturbed. It started with one cla.Â«s of
material and a second has followed in
fympathy. The tirms In the contest for
the business are the Carnegie Steel Com
pany, Limited, and Jones & McLaugh
lln, Limited. The products thus far
sought to be put on the market axe tank
and boiler plates.
One month ago tank plates sold at
$62 50 per ton. Now they are selling at
J. 45. a cut of $17 50. Boiler plates read
ily brought $G2 50 and after the decline in
tank material started it his reached the
$52 mark. It la possible that it will ulti
mately follow closely in the footsteps of
the tank products.
As yet no efforts have been made look
ing to a re-establishment of prices, and
as both are determined, with plenty of
financial and other facilities, the, near fu
ture will be watched with interest in iron
and steel circles.

raising his banner aloft, visible to all men,
where It might be observed and discusaed
with reflection.

INCIDENTS OF WAR
IN SOUTH AFRICA
ASSUMPTIONISTS
AGITATE PARIS
Only Political Sensation
of the Week.
COMMENTS OF THE PRESS
CARDINAL RICHARD .IS CON
DEMNED BY THE RADICALS.
?
Report That Great Britain Will Pick
a Quarrel With France by Attack
. ing Madagascar Receives
Apparent Confirmation.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
PARIS, Jan. 27.-The trial of the As
sumptionlst Fathers has Injected some life
in an otherwise prosaic political week.
The prosecution of the fathers Is believed
to be the beginning of a Government cam
paign against reactionary clericalism,
which recently has too openly entered
the political arena.
The order of the Assumptionists is re
markable for the ascetic life of its mem
bers, which, with its large revenues, has
permitted the accumulation of great
wealth, which, according to the Govern
ment supporters, has been mainly used
to undermine the republic. They have
not accepted defeat and have decided to
appeal against their conviction.
An outburst of protests in the radical
press has been caused by what looks like
the apparent lack of tact on the part of
Cardinal Richard, the Archbishop of
Paris, In visiting the fathers and express
ing his sorrow at their conviction and
thus openly encouraging them. The rad
icals demand that the Government take
some action against Cardinal Richard for
his overt identification with so-called ille
gal associations. Some newspapers even
use the incident a? a lever in favor of
the separation of church and state. The
first fruit of this agitation has already
been borne in the shape of an official de
mand upon the Cardinal for an explana
tion of his conduct.
To this the private secretary of the Car
dinal has replied that the Cardinal has no
thought that his action had political sig
nificance; he simply wished to sympatnize
with the fathers on passing through a
painful everit, and he aid not wish to pro
test against the verdict. The words at
tributed to the Cardinal, the secretary
added, were a garbled summary without
official character.
T special dispatch to the Temps from
Rome says: '^According to information
from the best sources the Vatican, though
regretting the conviction of the Assurap
tlonlsts. would have preferred that Car
dinal Richard had not made the visit by
which the enemies of religion might profit.
Had Pope Leo been ccyisulted Cardinal
Richard would not have made the visit,
which was kind but not politic."
The Nationalist organs denounce the
Government for its prosecution of politi
cal opponents, which they declare was the
sole motive for the trial. The result of
the trial furnished the most exciting ses
sion of the Chamber of Deputies since its
reopening. A string of Deputies rose for
the purpose of repudiating the statements
of the public prosecutor at the trial that
they were aided at their elections by the
ten years detention *nd military degradation
with Interdiction of residence.
The Dreyfusards are very angry at the
form of the announcement. - The Aurore
calls it an upright forgery because it
omits all mention of the extenuating cir
cumstances found before the court-mar
tial and the pardon.
Enlivening scenes have been occasioned
by the annual drawing of lots to select
conscripts from Paris, which began this
week. Parties of young conscripts have
been parading the boulevards wearing
enormous tri-color rosettes in their but
tonholes and with highly colored patriotic
pictures bearing their army number stuck
in the front of their hats. Each arron
dissement has its own day of drawing at
the town hall in the presence of military
officials. The young fellows celebrate the
day as a holiday and the streets of the
arrondlssements nightly resound with
their jollifications.
A discussion in the Chamber of Deputies
has revealed the fact that the world
famed Louvre is in perpetual danger of
fire. The building adjoins the Ministry of
Colonies, where fourteen fires occurred
last year. M.Redon, the architect of the
Louvre, shares the apprehension, and as
a result the dabate better measures of
protection will be taken.
The chapel commemorative of the char
ity bazaar holacaust, to which the Count
and Countess Castellane contributed 1,000.
000 francs, will be dedicated May 4. the
anniversary of the catastrophe.
M. Cambon, the French Embassador at
Washington, who is due to arrive in
America to-day, delayed his departure
from the date originally fixed in an effort
to overcome the opposition to the French-
American reciprocity treaty, and occupie 1
much time in explaining Its terms/ Hut
protests against it are coming to the Gov
ernment from Chambers of Commerce all
over France. The agricultural committee
of the Selns-et-Oise, denounces the meas
ure as an economic peril, because it is
claimed it would destroy the effects of
the protection so laboriously acquired for
French agriculture in the last few yeara.
The Chamber of Commerce of Elboef
bitterly complains that the Government
has secured no benefits for French wocl
and wool products at a time when that
industry is so tried by the lack of mar
kets.
Serious fears are entertained by the fail
ure of the winter crops owing to the con
tinued bad weather rotting young sprouts.

STANFORD DEFEATED.
Fireman's Fund Team Wins in a
Quiet Game.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. 26.â
The Fireman's Fund team beat Stanford
at baseball this afternoon in the first
game of the season by a score of 8 to 2.
The work of the college men was loose
at times, though the battery showed up
well for so early in the season^ Lanagan
striking but ten men.
The work, of the Firemen was consist
ent throughout the game, no one being
marked for star playing.
Trainer Murphy of the cardinal nine
was well pleased with the showing made
by his men, and says that v.'ith hard prac
tice and probably a few changes he will
be able to turn out a winning team.
The gentlemanly conduct of the Fire
men have made them exceedingly popular
with the members of the Stanford nine,
and several more good-natured contests
with them are looked forward to.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â Admiral Wat
son has cabled the following account to
the Navy Department of the participation
of the navy In General Kobbe's successful
campaign through the islands south of
Luzon, which contain most of the hemp
ports of -the archipelago?
MANILA, Jan. 27.â Kobbe's expedition to
Southeast Luzon, convoyed by the Nashville,
the Helena and the Marlveles, was a complete
Bucoer*. Sorgo&oson, Donsal, Bulua, Vlrac
end L^gaspe were taken and garrisoned. Le
saspe was captured on Tuesday after sharp
fighting, the Nashville co-operating Inside of
COO yards. Private Marine Franklin was
wounded and on board the Nashville Captain
Bradley and five others, none seriously. Fifty
one dead Filipinos were found in the trenches.

WATSON.
The admiral reports the following deaths
in the fleet: Lawrence Orson Adams, ap
prentice of the Solace; W. P. Wilker, ordi
nary seaman of the Wheeling; Henry
Thomas, landsman of the Bennlngton;
James Frankllr., ordinary seaman of the
Castjne, and P. C. Fenaney, private ma
rine of the New Orleans.
Admiral Watson reports this morning
that he has taken possession of Isabella
coaling station and established a marine
garrison there under the command of
Lieutenant Long. A short time ago, Â«feel
ing the need of a coaling station for the
use of smaller vessels In the Philippine
archipelago in the southern Islands remote
from Manila, Admiral Watson dispatched
a vessel to look into the conditions at
Zamboanga, where the Spaniards had
maintained a garrison and a coaling sta
tion for many years. It was found upon
investigation, however, that the harbor at
that point was not suitable for naval ves
sels, owing to shallow water. Attention
being directed elsewhere, a small but per
fectly protected and deep harbor was
found in Basilan Island, where the Span
lards had already established a coaling
station. The navy, as already stated, took
possession of this; garrisoned the place
and is taking steps to add to its coal
supply.
The Solace sailed to-day from Manila
for San Francisco, and on the way she
will touch at the new coaling station, as
well as at Hollo. Cebu and Guam, and
thence returning to Yokohama will strike
across the Pacific for San Francisco. She
will carry the bodies of Captain Nichols,
who died while in command of the Mo
nadnock, and Captain Ingateof the Ma
rine Corp-5, who died at Guam from a sur
gical operation.

They -were by accident found near a
Yaqul camp. No proof of any guilt has
been presented to the world; only the
news cf a merciless death to each, prob
ably ordered by Diaz himself. If an In
vestigation of these facts turn out as re
ported, then Sonora may say good-by to
the Mexican republic. The history of
Texas may be repeated. President Diaz
should disclaim at once the accusation
that his authorities have shot Innocent
Americans In Sonora, and he should warn
his authorities to avoid frictions, which
can only end by a repetition of the Texas
invasion."

ILLINOIS ANTI-FREAK
LAW VALID IN PART
Only That Portion Concerning the
Exhibition of Criminals Held
to Be Constitutional.
CHICAGO, Jan. 27.â Judge Gibbons of
the Circuit Court to-day rendered a deci
sion In regard to the anti-freak law passed
by the last Legislature, which prohibits
the public exhibition of persons who have
become conspicuous through some crim
inal act, or whose deformity is such as to
attract public curiosity. Judge Gibbons
sustains the clause of the law prohibiting
the exhibition of criminals as a wise and
salutary measure, but declares unconsti
tutional the clause prohibiting the exhibi
tion of deformed persons. The ruling of
the court was made in the case of a col
ored boy born without arms, who has
been on exhibition in a Chicago museum,
and who has acquired t-kill in sketching
with pen or pencil held between his toes.
In rendering his decision Judge Gibbons
drew a parallel between the case of the
colored boy and that of Helen Kellar, and
said:
"Whoever is capable of acting, of doing,
ct thinking. iÂ« a man entitled to enjoy life,
to pursue happiness and to demand from
the State and from society the equal pre
lection of the law, whether he stands
forth erect and beautiful as an Adonis or
with the features of a Janus or the bodies
of Siamese twins."
The decision Is regarded as an Import
ant one and was awaited with much inter
est by museum and show men.

Instructions to the Spokane Postmas-
ter Reiterated.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.-The Postofflce
Department has received reports from
Spokane, Wash., showing that the order
to fumigate mail leaving that place for
British Columbia has not as yet been car
ried out. The reports state that neither
the Postmaster nor the Health Officer
there believe it necessary to disinfect the
mails, because they think the smallpox
scare to be unwarranted. The epidemic
now In evidence there, they aay, is
chickenpox. The Postofflce Department
has. however, reiterated Its Instructions
directing the postal officials to disinfect
the malls.
The reports from Spokane state that
Nelson, B. C, Is the only place that has
declared a quarantine against Spokane.
Rossland. B. C, Is willing to receive mall
from Spokane without disinfection.
DENTISTS FOR THE ARMY.
Proposition That Fails to Develop
Strong Support.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â A strong ef
fort Is being made to open the army to
dental surgeons, and a bill has been pre
pared for Introduction In Congress author
izing the appointment of such surgeons,
with the rank of major, so as to allow
one for each regiment. Adjutant General
Corbln and Surgeon General Sternberg
disapprove of the proposed legislation.
A similar move is beln-g made to have
veterinary surgeons incorporated Into the
regular estahllshment as commissioned
officers, but, like the dental surgeon
scheme, the plan Is said to lack the sup
port and favor of the military authorities.

LABOR LEADERS CALL
UPON THE PRESIDENT

pers, president of the American Federa

tigation by the Treasury Department were
dismissed as unfounded.

FINNS AGAIN APPEAL
FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT
Czar Names the Questions Which tha
Diet of the Dependency May
Discuss.
HELSINGFORS, Finland, Jan. 27. -The,
Czar's speech, which was read at tha
opening of the Diet to-day, explained that
it was intended to take measures to meet
the recent misfortunes In Finland, tha
principal of which was the failure of tha
crops, thus causing largo emigration. The,
proposed measures, it was announced. In
cluded the postponement of the maneu
vers of the reserves, so that the men
would not be prevented from following
their ordinary occupation. As a mean.-; to>
check emigration measures will be taken,
to place people not possessed of property
in a position to acquire land. Questions
not connected with these subjects, tha
speech says, should not be discussed la
the Diet, and the discussions will raise a
doubt as to whether the annexation of
Finland is compatible with exlsUnc con
ditions.
'After the reading of the speech, the
Presidents of the four States replied. Tha
repprts of the nobles dwelt upon the Im
portance which the people attached to
self-government, which they regarded as
a necessity of life. The report of the.
peasantry attributed the increase In emi
gration to the oppressive conditions
weighing upon the Flnlanders. who agreed
to the doubling of the military burdens
on condition that their free social condi
tions should be preserved. The fulfill
ment of this understanding, he said, was
necessary to enable the people to bear
their burdens.

HIGH WIND ON
EASTERN COAST
But One Vessel Arrived
in New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â As a result of
the great blow last night there was. but
one arrival In Quarantine to-day. This
was the British steamer Dean, which Is
chartered by the Dutch West Indies line.
Captain Hamilton, the master of the
Dean, says that the wind along the coast
exceeded In velocity anything In his ex
perience on the ocean for twenty years.
One of the officers of the ship was car
ried bodily across the bridge from the
port to the starboard side In an unusually
heavy gust at midnight and barely es
caped going overboard. The marine ob
server at the highlands of Navesink
"picked up" half a dozen square-riggers
In the east offing at sunset last evening.
One of the sailers, a bark, was In tow.
Between the Hook and Long Branch he
counted .fifteen schooners at the same
time. None of these arrived during the
night and the Inference Is that they were
blown off shore by the fresh northwester
ly wind.
The wind at midnight had a velocity of
seventy-five miles an hour at the Hook
and between 2 and 4 o'clock Its speed was
measured at eighty-five miles. The fact
that the Jersey and outside Long Island
beaches were windwafd shores gave the
life-savers less responsibility than is or
dinarily felt in a high blow.
None of the regular liners were sight
ed to-day, although the American liner
St. Louis, from Southampton last Satur
day, and the North German Lloyd steam
er Aller, from Bremen a week, ago last
Thursday, were expected to arrive at an
early hour. The two Glasgow liners, the
State of Nebraska of the Allarr-State line
and the Ethiopia of the Anchor line, are
making long passages. The State of Ne
braska Is now seventeen days out from
the Clyde. The Ethiopia left Glasgow the
day after the Nebraska.

CHICAGO, Jan. 27.â Miss Pearl Jack,
whose refusal to become the wife of lor
gensen, an Oak Park milk wagon driver,
drcve him to suicide, will profit to the ex
tent of $5000 by his death.
Jorgensen had been calling on the young
woman for several months and their
friends believed that there was an under
standing between them. The young man
had furnished a flat in a near-by suburb
and made every preparation for matri
mony. Among these was the taking out
of a $5000 life Insurance policy In the name
of his future wife.
When the time came, however. Miss
J?ck declined to have the driver. He was
moody for several days and finally start
ed away. As he left he told his friends
that if he did not return they might di
vide the furniture of his fiat among them.
The next day he was found with a bullet

EL PASO, Tex., Jan. 27.â Friends of
George Lunt and Charles Burns of El
Paso, reported last night to have been
killed with six other Americans by Gen
eral Torres at the recent round-up of
Yaqul Indians, to-day made formal appli
cation to the United States Consul,
Charles W. Klndrick, at Juarez, Mexico,
for a full Investigation of the affair. Con
sul Klndrick notified the State Depart
ment and telegraphed the consular agent
at Guaymas, Mexico, for a complete re
port. Reports from Naco, Ariz., received
to-day confirm the killing of the six
Americans. H. J. Coburn, now here from
Blsbee, Ariz, says the cowboys and
miners In Southern Arizona and Mexico
have organized and are preparing to In
vade Sonora and avenge the murder of
the six prospectors. They will fight
against the Mexican troops for the inde
pendence of the Sonora and the Yaqul
nations, and he Is of the opinion that the
contemplated movement will be crowned
with success.

Juan S. Hart, Cuban Interpreter for the
Evacuation Commission ond a captain of
immunes, wili say to-mcrrow;
"The six men who are paid to have
been dispatched in Spanish style by Tor-
faro games and such lottery Joints as he
could locate to close down and they have
complied, with the single exception of Ed
Kripp, the owner of the Columbia Cafe
at SLxth and J streets. . Kripp, who is
generally known throughout the State as
the manager of the Gilt Edge Baseball
nine, owns poolrooms and keno games
from which In a few years he has grown
rich. He will hold out as long as he can
and will probably barricade his door 3
against me entrance of the police. Chief
Sullivan said to-night that with respect
to xwripp. as with others, he would act
within the law, but he proposed that the
orders of the Mayor shall be carried out
to the letter.
The action of Mayor Clark with regard
to shutting down all illicit games ap
pears to remove the opportunity for the
doubtful Trustees to excuse themselves
from voting for the ordinance Monday
night on the ground that Mayor Clark has
a personal grudge against the poohsellers.
It has just coraÂ» to light that Mayor
Clark has called the clergymen of all de
nominations to a conference and has de
clared to them that he will stop gambling
in Sacramento or give up his office. In
his instructions to Chief Sullivan this
afternoon the following occurs:
All gambling that is against th.3
law must be discontinued. You and
I are called upon to enforce the laws)
as we find them, and if any law of
this State is being violated in our
community our plain duties require
us to punish the offender and to pre
vent repetitions of such violations.
Several of the persons whose interests
are concerned In the Mayor's orders said
to-night that In the event of the passage
of the antl-poolroom ordinance Mayor
Clark will relax his attitude in respect to
other modes of gambling, but this view
certainly does not coincide with the offi
cial utterances and personal pledges of
the new Mayor. It is certain that, in the'
end. no matter how accommodatlnr they
may now appear, the gamblers will not
surrender without a hard fight, and it la
not unllkelv that Sacramento will <Â»cc
some spirited times . in the next few
months of Mayor's Clark's term.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 27.â The gamblers
of Sacramento are having the fight of
their lives. Mayor Clark this afternon
directed Chief of Police Sullivan to close
down every gambling game and lottery
Joint, and the' carrying out of the order
was immediately entered upon. The new
Mayor has pledged himself either to stop
gambling In Sacramento or resign his of
fice in favor of somebody else. He seems
to be confident of his ability to accomplish
this result, remarking this afternoon thru
all illicit games could be kept from run
ning with the aid of four police officers
bent on the performance of their duty.
In all the churches ' to-morrow sermons
will be preached setting forth the evils
of the poolrooms, and asking citizens to
demand the passage of the anti-poolroom
ordinance at the hand 3 of the Board of
Trustees Monday night. The entire city
Is groused to an appreciation of the men
ace which confronts the schoolboys and
clerks of Sacramento', and which has al
ready brought disgrace to many house
holds. So strong Is the sentiment that not
a few of the most Influential citizens have
publicly expressed the opinion that the
officials who oppose this measure mar
never expect further favors at the han-is
of the people. The Bee to-night arraigns
the doubtful Trustees, and the pressure
which' is being brought against them by
the advocates of the ordinance. Is such
that It Is believed they will be unable to
withstand it.
Scandals innumerable have arisen In the
Police Department for years past because
of the prevalence of all forms of gambling
In this community. Each recurring
Grand Jury has investigated these scan
dals and most of them have returned In
dictments, but these, one after the other,
have been quashed either through some
legal defect or because the political
powers were gamblers themselves or
were closely' allied with their interests.
It remains to be seen what permanent re
sults are to flow from the present cru
sade, but among taxpayers and the heads
of trie households of this city there la no
division of the sentiment supporting
Mayor Clark's determined onslaught.
Chief Sullivan said to The Call corre
spondent to-night that he had notified the
have been a partisan Governor, but tbat
he always tried to be honest.
TRIAL OF SENATOR HARREL.
Colonel Whallen Testifies Against the
Accused Politician.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Jan. 27.â The trial
of State Senator S. B. Harrel, charged by
John H. Whallen with having obtained
money under false pretenses, was begun
here to-day. The case grew out of Har
rel's charge made a^ Frankfort that
Whallen had paid him $4500 to vote
against Goebel in the contest now before
the Legislature.
Whallen, the first witness, told of his
meeting with Harrel in this city, Harrel,
he said, wanted $10,000 to stop the contest,
saying he had letters that would damage
Goebel. Whallen said he and Harrel
agreed that t.ie latter was to get $300 to
stop the contest, but that Harrel was not
to throw his vote in any way. Colonel
WhaJlen agreed to this, after informing:
Harrel that he was not bribing him to
vote, but simply paying him to produce
valuable evidence.
Upon the conclusion of the testimony for
the commonwealth the attorneys for Har
rel. without calling upon Harrel or any
other of their witnesses to testify, moved
that the warrant be dismissed, but this
was overruled and Harrel was held to an
swer to the Grand Jury under bond in the
sum of $1009;
FRANKFORT. Ky., Jan. 27.â The first
actual test of strength between the Rer
publicans and Democratic forces in the
Goebel-Taylor contest came to-day, and
proved a victory for Goebel. The Demo
crats claim the result of to-day's struggle
as decisive, while the Republicans, al
though freely admitting a defeat, declare
Jhat they will fight to the finish and h?..ve
still strong hopes of retaining Governor
Taylor In his seat. _
The fight to-day came on the vote of the
House in the contest brought by H. S.
Van Meter of Fayette County for the seat
heretofore held by Henry S. Berry; Both
Fides realized that the test of real
strength would be made on this issue,
and every effort -was made to get out the
largest possible vote. The vote in favor
of Van Meter was 51 to 43. Hays (R.) and
Sledge (D.) were absent. Berry had no
vote because of his personal interest in
the contest. Speaker Trimble did not vote.
The contest came to a vote on the ques
tion of the adoption of one of two reports
from the committee. The Republicans,
being in the majority on the committee,
presented a majority report in lavor of
Berry. The one Democratic member of
the committee submitted a minority re
port in favor of the seating of Van Meter.
The decision of t" Â¦> House was reached
upon a motion to substitute the minority
report in favcr of Van Meter for the ma
jority report in favor of Berry-
As the call proceeded Representative
Balrd, who was considered doubtful by
both sides, declined to vote. Cochran was
the Srst Democrat to vote for Berry; Eg
bert followed him, then came Girder, Lai
ferty. Orr. Hilton and Willingham.
When the call was finished the vote xras
4C to 46, several members present not vot
ing. Egbert changed his vote, making it
47 to 45 in favor of Van Meter. On the call
for absentees Baird sided with Van Meter,
Democratic cheers greeting him as he an
nounced his vote. Three more Democrats
who had. not responded to the rollcall vot
ed for the minority report and the clerk
announced the total 51 to 45.
The majority report as amended by the
minority report was then adopted and
Van Meter was declared a member cf the
House.
There was much wrath in the P.epub
lican ranks ovÂ»*r the failure of E. F.
Hayes of Pulaski County to vote. He
failed entirely to put in an appearance
at the^Statehouse and was seen at the
depot a few minutes before a train ar
rived. ...fter that the Republicans saw
him no more, nor could the members of
the campaign committee locate him, al
though they spent the afternoon in the
search.
Adjutant General Collier hurriedly Im
pressed an engine on the Louisville and
Nashville road and made a Jlying trip to
]^x:r.gton in the effort to find IJayes and
bring him baxk. On reaching Lexington
Ie was informed that Hayes had gone.
He was compelled to return without his
man.
E. G. Sebree, the Republican campaign
manager, declared last night that the
vote on the contest to-day was a crucial
t*>st of strength and expressed himself
es confident of at least fifty votes for
Berry. After the House had adjourned
he said:
"They knocked us out. There is nÂ»
doubt about that. I felt sure of fifty
votes, of course including" Hayes, and
counted on ten Democratic votes for
Kerry. However, ibis is not the vote for
Governor, although the seating of Van
Meter increases the odds against us. I
jTf-sume u.e Democrats will decide the
other contests now pending as this one
has been decided. We will light it out
to the end. however. The people may be
cure of that."
The Democratic leaders, without excep
tion, claim that the seating of Van Meter
foreshadows accurately the seating of
Goebel. The House now stands sixty
iJemocrats, including Van Meter and
Ppeaker Trimble, and forty Republicans:
the Senate, twenty-six Democrats and
twelve Republicans. The Democrats, on
a vote in the Gubernatorial contest, can
have but a possible maximum of twenty
four, as Gofbel will have no vote and
Senator Hill, a Goebel man, is incapac
itated by illness and has never qualified.
Both Eid^s admit the Senate will be very
evenly divided. Seventy votes are neces
sary on joint ballot to seat Goebel as
Governor.
This was the last day allotted to the
contestees. Governor Taylor and Lieuten
ant Governor Marshall, for defense in the
pending Gubernatorial contest. The boards
adjourned promptly at 10 o'clock to-night
To meet on Monday afternoon, when the ar
guments begin. Kach side will be allowed
ten hours for argument, the boards having
fixed that time with the agreement or
counsel.
Governor Bradley was on the stand dur
ing nearly all the session to-night. He
reviewed his political history and his co:i
r.eÂ«tion with the presence of troops at thÂ«Â»
last election in Louisville, and insisted
that he had acted within his authoiny
and as he had thought the emergency de
manded. Concerning his alleged partisi".
ehip. the ex-Governor confessed that he
-sras an old campaigner, having started
oat in 1870 as a political speaker, but as
to partisanship, he said that he might

Japanese Convict Shows His Respect
for the Court.
With a low kow-tow, as though In the
presence of Buddha cast in lead or other

Judge Cook yesterday in order- that sen
tence might be passed on him for. his
crime. F.rank was a Japanese cook until
he became a criminal on November 24

taining a check for $150 from G. S. Take

Nuinada confessed the theft of the trou
sers, and when called before Judge Cook
to answer to the charge pleaded guilty.
He'said, however, that as he was ignorant
of the existence of the check- he should
be lightly dealt with. Judge Cook took
a different view of the matter, however,
and after the plea of guilty had beer, en
tered ordered Frank to stand up for sen
tence. Frank did as bid, and then back
ing up made a low kow-tow in true Ori
ental fashion. The bailiff suggested that
he stand up straight, but Frank knew how
to conduct himself in the presence of a.
superior" mortal and he remained with
head almost to his knees and arms out
stretched until judgment had been passed.
The court ordered him confined In San
Quentin for a term of three years, and
Frank was led away to prison.
Thomas Curley, convicted on a charga
of grand larceny for the theft of a watch
from J. E- Fitzgibbon, was sent to San

Sheriff Wants Two Extra Guards.
Sheriff Lackmann yesterday sent a re
quest to Mayor Phelan that he be allowed
two extra guards at Jail 2. He states that
there are thirty-two acres of land near
the Jail owned by the city, which could
be cultivated by the prisoners if there
were a sufficient number of guards. Here
tofore the land was cared for by laborers
from the Street Department, assisted by
the prisoners. If the guards are not al

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The latest of
the nev.s received here in regard to the
condition of affairs in Guam, the mid-
I'acilic possession of the United States,
is contained in a report just received by
the Secretary of the Navy from Captain
K. P. Lcary, U. S. N.. Governor of Guam.
The report is dated Government House,
Agana. Guam, L. 1., December 7, 1599, and
la as follows:
I>uriTnr the part week the epidemic of typhoid
fever ashore seem* to be waning- and I am
pleased to report that nearly all of our men in
the hospital are doing well and there have
been no deaths in the command since the three
already reported, but unfortunately at this Im
portant period the Tosemite'e Ice machine is
asaln out of commission and the sick are cry
ing for Ice.
We have been able to secure an additional
force of native laborers to work on the sewer
ditches and the.work is progressing favorably,
as is that on the evaporating plant.
I â¢will take this opportunity to commend Lieu
tenant Leooold for the excellent services that
he has performed at this station, for his zeal,
ability and .energy and especially for his cour
ageous determination to overcome obstacles and
utilize all possible resources available or pro
curable for a successful termination of the dif
ficult tank assigned to him.
The Thanksgiving day service on .shore at
the Roman Catholic church was a treat suc

evince a sincere, earnest and devout Interest in
their first American Thanksgiving day service
and reports from other villages assure me that
the day was properly respected throughout the
island, all of which Is most gratifying to us as
being representative of their cordial and faith
ful acceptance of the radical chance of gov

For the first time in many years the
local groves, chapters and circles of the
United Ancient Order of Druids acted last
S ! ?, h J in giving a grand
ball in Odd Fellows 1 Hall. The hall, which
was tastefully decorated with the colors
of the order, red, blue and green, was
crowded with members, their relatives

tilled with spectators who did not care to
take part in the dancing. There never has
been so large an attendance in that hall
that so thoroughly enjoyed a programme
of dances as did the one last night. The
several committees were assiduous in the
discharge of their respective duties, and
there was not an incident to mar the
pleasure of one of the greatest reunions
ever held in this city under the auspices
of Druids.

Dennis Daly, the young plumber who
was injured by car 18 of the San Fran

View about ten days ago, died at the City
and County Hospital yesterday.
Daly was returning from work at 5
o'clock In the afternoon of Saturday, Jan
uary 20, when he got in front of the elec
tric car bound in. Car 29 had Just reached
Ocean View station, and in some manner
he got between the two cars and- his right
arm was fractured. He also received a
slight wound on the head. He was taken
to the hospital and It was thought at the
time that his injuries were but trifling.
Captain Gillin, upon learning of Daly's
death, ordered the arrest of .T. S. Hunt,

The body of a well dressed young man
was found on the beach, at Mussel Point,
in San Mateo County, yesterday after
noon. In his hand was a pistol and he
had evidently committed suicide. He had
been dead for about two days.
The Coroner of San Mateo County was
notified and took charge o( the remains.
On the person of the deceased nothing
was found that would give any clew to
his identity.
TEMPORARILY INSANE.
Mrs. Berncro Killed Herself Because
Her Husband Scolded Her.
A Coroner's Jury yesterday returned a
verdict that Mrs. Louise Bernero of 1
Chambers â¢ place committed suicide on
January 25 by swallowing carbolic acid
while temporarily insane.
The evidence was to the effect that the
woman's father and her husband had up
braided her at the dinner table 'for not
keeping her nine months' old baby clean.
She took the scolding very much to heart
and as soon as her husband. Carlo, left
the house to. go to his saloon at 19 Hlnck-.
ley alley, she swallowed half the contents
of a bottle of carbolic acid.
Tha dead woman was only 22 years old.

Ex-Coroner Hill Threatened With Ar

Ex-Coroner Hill is threatened with ar

which Leeds D. Slack, clerk in the Aud

revolver was taken possession of by Po
liceman T. C. Murphy, and the following
day Captain Spillane instructed Murphy
to take the weapon to the Coroner's of
fice to be used at the Inquest and to brine
It back with him after the Inquest was
over.
Murphy returned without the revolver,
and told Captain Spillane that he had
handed it to Deputy Coroner Sullivan
who. had refused to return It, as be said
he was quite able to take care of it him
self. Since then a brother of Slack has
called two or three times at Captain
Splllane's office, demanding that the re
volver be given Into his custody, as It bo
longed to his brother. When application
was made at the Coroner's office the re
volver had disappeared and no trace of it
can. be found. Slack's brother saw Cap

Coroner he would have him arrested.

Preparations for Celebration of Open

JAMES AND KIDDER
IN SHAKESPEARE
MR, JAMES' title to â¢ acceptance
as a legitimate actor is clear
only within the lines of serious
work. Strangely enough, this
irreverent trifler is worthy of con
sideration only when he assumes j a
role in which there is dignity of pur
pose and depth of intention. His Autoly
cus was beside the mark, and his
Charles Surface a disreputable caricature,
but as Hamlet he commands immediate
attention and evinces in his acting of It
both subtlety and symmetry.
I had not seen James in the role before,
and did not look for commendable qual
ities that he yesterday displayed in the
enactment of it, and the credit that I
think is due him seems all the greater for
this reason. His conception of the part
is neither luminous nor ideal, but It is
careful, honest, rational. Tradition lifts
its hideous head in the Shakespearean es
says of all artists, but there is enough
originality of treatment in Mr. James'
Hamlet to make it interesting. He does
not resort to cheap devices to impress
the untutored. He does not act by fits
and starts. He is not too much the slave
to precedent, and gives to many uncon
sldered passages the impress of a finely
studied art. This is notably so in the sec
ond act, in which his colloquy with Polo
nius is most happily handled. In the In
tense and less subtle scenes he does not
do so well.
Miss Kidder Is out of her element again
as Ophelia, though there is always the
charm of her personality to consider. She
is not so much the girl as she is the
woman, for the molding of her mentality
is essentially mature.
Â« â¢ â¢ Â¦
Louis James and Kathryn Kidder In
"Macbeth" afford excellent entertainment.
The play itself is tremendous and the
roles of Glammis and his spouse as diffi
cult as any, in the Shakesperean repertory.
Mr. James' sinks his individuality more in
the part of Macbeth than in any other
character, and acts it effectively. He has
at once the heroic front and thÂ© craven
heart. He is the tyrant and the coward
and lends to the work in hand an Impulse
tempered with repression that is eminent
ly artistic. The weakness of spirit that
now and again besets the guilty Thane is
admirably depicted in pitiable abjectness.
In the scene with his lady after the mur
der of Duncan Mr. James makes Macbeth
absolutely puerile, and I think correctly
so.
In the banquet scene his acting is admi
rable. . It is high wrought Indeed, but well
within the limits of dramatic dignity. Mr.
James does not rant, which fact cannot
better be attested than by comparing bis
dynamic range with that of Mr. Hanford.
The latter bellows the lines of Macduff
with a voice that would put a steam siren
to shame, and is ably followed by Barry
Johnstone in the part of Banquo.
Miss Kidder is pleasing as Lady Mac
beth, if 1 may use the word in cohnection
with the character. Except for the fact
that at times she uses her voice too
openly, her diction is admirable and her
acting not merely intelligent but intellec
tual. Nothing could .be better than the
art with which she incites her timorous
husband to crime. Her appearance is in
itself a lasting delight. She has appa
rently a remarkable feeling for the pic
turesque and is always the nucleus of the
scenic scheme. There is - verlty\ in her
vestments and a very high order of art
in her adaptment to the costumes of
classic periods.

Mile. Trebelll's third concert was a suc
cess in every way, if we are to Judge by
the size and appreciation of the audience.
I have offered some btrictures on her
style, but I find her an enjoyable artist,
who in a broad sense sings admirably.
Her interpretation of difficult numbers is
alwa>'3 interesting; there is meaning in
everything ehe Binga, despite a lack of
tone color in her voice. .The dramatic
quality of which she at first- seemed de
ficient was abundantly attested In her
Ringing of "Vous gui me fuyer." by Duve
noy, which is in itself an Immense thing,
not lightly to be undertaken. It was the
most enjoyable item of an interesting pro
gramme. Tbe "Ah, Lo So" from "The
Magic . Flute"' was giver with much art
and its pathos, while not all that it might
be, was well expressed. Mllo. Trebelll
also sang the "Batti, Batti" from "Don
Giovanni with spirit, and other numbers
in a manner that could not fall. to please.
I do not find her voice naturally pleas
ant, and her way of singing is, variously
vulnerable, but she has with her tech
nical blemishes, a technical command that
is admirable and much taste of interpre
tation, besides personal qualities that are
sure to captivate her listeners.- :. â¢ - -

TWO BOYS ARE
ARRESTED FOR
DARING CRIME
Drove Off With Rig
and Coin.
FIVE DETECTIVES ON CASE
?
BEHIND BABS AT CALIFORNIA
STREET STATION.
Two boys giving their names as Ed
Smith and James O'Brien, each about
17 years of age, were arrested last night
and taken to the California-street station;
where their names were placed on the
small book. Both are supposed to have
been implicated lp the daring robbery of
a horse, wagon and Â»iOO in coin, committed
at the corner of California and Davis
streets, on December 3L
The crime with which the boys will
probably be charged with later was one
of the most daring that has been record
ed in police annals for some time. About
noon of the day mentioned Bert McCoy,
a driver for Robert McCoy & Co., grocers
at 156 Ninth street; drove to the corner of
Davis and California streets. In his
wagon was a quantity of provisions and
on the seat lay an overcoat containing
$700 in coin, with which he intended to
purchase holiday goods.
McCoy entered a commission house and
remained inside for a few minutes. When
he came out again he was dumfounded to
find that some one had driven off with the
horse and wagon and the overcoat and
coin.
A short time afterward a message was
received from a police officer that the
horse and -waeon had been found at the
corner of Vallejo and Jones streets, but
that the overcoat, money and groceries
had disappeared. Detectives Dillon,
Crockett, Wren, Dinan and Reynolds were
detailed on the case by Captain Bohen
and on the day following the crime ar
rested Charles Huth, a restaurant keeper
at 311 Montgomery avenue, for complicity
in the crime. In Huth's place was found
a quantity of the stolen groceries.
About 10 o'clock last night Detectives
Wren and Dillon arrested Smith and
O'Brien and the alleged thieves were soon
lodged behind the bars. The detectives
say that they have conclusive evidence
against the pair.

ISAAC ADAMS, Lake City, lowa.
Those who are losing their hair or have
parted with their locks can have It restored by
a remedy that is sent free to all. A Cincinnati
firm has concluded that the best way to con-
vince people that hair can be grown on any
head is to let them try It and see for them-
selves. All sorts of theories have been ad-
vanced to account for falling hair, but after
all It Is the remedy we are after and not the
theory. People who need more hair or are
anxious to save what they have or from sick-
ness, dandruff or other causes have lost their
hair should at once send their name and ad-
dress to the Altenhelm Medical Dispensary.

MISS EMMA EMOND.
The portraits of Miss Emma Emond show
what a striking difference is made In a per-
son when the bald head 13 covered with hair.
Miss Emond was totally bald, the hair follicles
not only upon her head, but upon her eye-
brows, being completely contracted, not tha
sign of a hair being found. She sent for a
free trial of the Foso Remedies and was re-
warded by a growth of hair which for thick-
ness, quality and luxuriance was as remark-
able as the result was gratifying. Miss Emond
lives in Salem. Mass., at 278 Washington street.
ISAAC H. ADAMS.
Isaac H. Adams of Lake City. lows. Is a con-
spicuous example of tha fact that baldness can
be cured. He says: "My hair cama out so bad
that I got bald all over the top of my head and
the scalp got shiny. ' I used the Foso Treatment
and In forty-eight hours the remainder of my
hair stopped falling out and In a, few weeks I
had as fine a growth of hair as any man would
want." Mr. Adams sent his photographs to the
proprietor of the Foso Remedies to show that
a remarkable change has been produced.

wise." Mr. Bishop sent for a frea trial of

CARNEGIE'S VIEW
AS TO CHARITY
Must Be Discriminating
to Be Effective.
AIDING OF BEGGARS DECRIED
TENDS TO THE INCREASE OF
PAUPERISM.
Turning to National Policy, the Mil
lionaire Justifies His Course
in Striving Against ..
Imperialism.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27.â Andrew Carnegie
was the guest of honor at a dinner given
by the Lotos Club to-night. There were
numerous speakers, chief among them be
ing Mr. Carnegie, President Lawrence of
the Lotos Club, President Seth Low and
W. Bourke Cochran. In the course of his
speech Mr. Carnesie said:
Private charity must be discriminating In
order to be useful. More pauperism will be
bred by Indiscriminate charity. Let a multi
millionaire take his millions to the slums and
call the people together, saying: "There is a
wrong distribution of wealth in the world; you
have not cot your share; I gtve to each onfe
of you his share in my millions." Let that
be done In the morning and let the millionaire
return at night to see what good his action has
dono and he will not find happiness, but pan
demonium. Let him distribute another million
and another million every day for a month and
pauperization will increase every day. He had
dene more injury in a month than he will good
all the rest of his life.
It is difficult to help those who do not help
themselves, and my preference for free librar
ies as a means of assisting mankind is that
libraries give nothing for nothing; in order to
get benefit every man himself must read and
study. As for money given to beggars of
whose needs and habits we are Ignorant, I
can conceive of no use of money so well cal
culated to Increase pauperism and demoralize
the people. .
To be popular is easy; to be right when
right Is unpopular is difficult.
When the passions are aroused and the war
fever rages any man can be popular who howla
for war, but the most valuable citizen of the
State at that time will ' probably be the citi
zen who opposes the drawing of the sword.
The heroes of political life are not those who
stir the lowest passions of the people, but
those who have stood against their govern
ments, demanding Justice for countries other
than their own. I repudiate with scorn the
immoral doctrine, "Our country, right or
wrong." If my country is wrong or my friend
is wrong I am their beÃt friend If I endeavor
to show both that for a moment they have
been led astray, have deserted the path of
honor, or mercy, or Justice. I have never
written a word which my conscience did not
Impel me to write, nor stood for a cause that
I did not consider holy. When my country is
wrong may she receive the lesson that "right
eousness eicalteth a nation." The flag we all
love and revere we love and revere for what
it stands for. It should be the'symbol of what
is right, noble .and Just. He is no patriot who
encourages his country to take the wrong
path. Xot he who follows but he who leads
public opinion in the right path is the best
citizen, who, above all others, should bÂ« most
highly honored.

? . â
Eduard Jose de Martinez S-wears That
Havana Officials Arranged All
Details and Carried Out the
Diabolical Plan.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The Herald will
to-morrow print a long etory of state
ments made by Eduard Jose de Martinez,
who claims to -have been implicated under
Government orders in the explosion which
wrecked the battleship Maine in Havana
harbor and slaughtered hundreds of
American sailors. The Herald does not
vouch for the truthfulness of the state
ments, but the tale is supported by the
sworn testimony of the informer, who
professes to have been, if not an actual
participant in the work, at least an active
observer of the preparations. One of the
most remarkable features of the story is
the fact that De Martinez did not take ref
uge in Spain after the explosion, but in
the United States, in a little town in Ala
bamaâGordonâjust north of the' Florida
line. The story of this man was told to
the officials of the Wax and Navy depart
ments. To Secretary of the Navy Long
and Commander Wainwright, the Maine's
executive officer, and to Chief Wllkie of
the secret service, this man gives the
mest minute details and shows copies of
cipher dispatches to support his remark
able story. Neither expert was convinced
of the complete truthfulness of the Span
lard's statement nor the authenticity of
his documents, yet neither was satisfied
that they were wholly false.
One interesting fact is that certain offi
cials in Washington do not care to know
who blew up the Maine and would shun
an investigation to that end. That is to
say. they do not desire to know It offi
cially, though they find the topic an inter
esting one unofficially.
Do Martinez makeÂ« a sworn'statement in
Washington, dated January 24, in which
the deponent says he is and has been by
birth a subject of Spain, and from thÂ©
/ear 1896 until March i, 1898, he was a
trusted employe in the secret service of
Spain: In ISU7 he was on duty in the United
States and was ordered to report in
Madrid. The deponent says he attended
a military council which was held on De
cember 16 and 17. After making his re
port on the New York and Pensacola har
bor defenses he was given further instruc
tions to proceed to Savannah, accom
panied by Senor Mendola, as the bearer of
certain dispatches and instructions re
ceived from the hands of the Due de Rio
and Captain Varteril and approved bjÂ» the
council. Copies of these documents aro
appended to the sworn statement of de
ponent.
Deponent says that various mines and
torpedoes were prepared and laid under
the direction of said Lieutenant E
C , and it was one.of the mines so made
and placedâ buoy No. 4, on the night of
February 14 â that blew up the Lfnited
States battleship Maine in the harbor of
Havana on the following night, February
15, 1898. Deponent further says that the
details of the preparation made for this
explosion as reported by him to a repre
sentative of the New York Herald and
the Btory of his movements, both before
and after that event, as given to said rep
rebentative of the New York Herald, are
accurate and truthful in all respects to
the best of his knowledge and belief.
The Fund Divided.
At the closing meeting of the Native
Sons' and Daughters' committee on the
reception of the First California Volun
teers, the affairs were wound up and
there remained a surplus of about 1250.
It was decided to contribute one-half of
this sum to the Native Sons' board of re
l lief and the other halt to the Native
â¢ Daughters' B<uÂ»*Â» , .--;

GOOD OUTLOOK FOR REALTY.
THE real estate market continues
active, although there have been
no sales reported during the past
week of sufficient size or im
portance to attract particular at
tention. This fact, however, has no bear
ing on the situation, as it is well known
that negotiations are proceeding for sev
eral pieces of property which are h^-li
at several hundred thousand dollars each.
One prominent investor made a direct
offer of $300,000 for a valuable piece of
downtown property within the past few
days, tendering a certified check for the
full amount as an earnest of his willing
ness to close the bargain at once. The
offer was not accepted- and it is not posi
tively known that it was refused and a
bargain may be struck during the coming
week. The brokers do not exactly relish
the fact that this offer was made direct
by the would-be purchaser and it is but
natural that they should look askance at
the prospect of a fat commission being
matched from them.
There is a vaJuaDle plecÂ© of Improved
property on Butter street in a very de
sirable location that may be snapped up
In the near future. It pays a net income
of 6 per cent on 5300,000 and can be had
lor that figure. The sale of a piece ot
Market street property, below lurk, is
also within the possibilities of early con
tummatJon. The property, it is under
stood is being held at something less than
J300. 000 Â»nd the prospective purchaser
hopes to get It for something less than is
a There is a rumor that the San Francisco
Gaslight Company has been offered
BJBjOtiO for eevcral pieces of its realty,
but that it is holding out for $3tW,000.
Among the property mentioned are the

ANNUAL BANQUET
OF GRIDIRON CLUB
Scribes Make Merry at
Washington.
BURLESQUE ON EXPANSION
LOFTY RULES DETHRONED BY
UNCLE SAM.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The fifteenth
annual dinner of the Gridiron Club was
givea at the Arlington Hotel to-night, and
like its rredecessors was the most suc
cessful event of the season. The club is
composed of forty Washington corre
spondents, who each year give a number
of dinners and make the last Saturday
evening 1:1 January a notable occasion, as
it is the anniversary of the organization.
The banquvi hall was handsomely decor
ated, the ceilings and walls covered in
laurel, smilax and maidenhair ferns,
while palms and other tropical plants
â¢.illeU every window and corner of the
: m. Through all this mass of green
were mere than a thousand electric lights
of all colors. The stables were banked
v.ith flowers, orchids and roses predom
inating, while many vases of American
;>i auty ro^es adorned the room.
Henry LitchJield West of the Washing
ton Post, the new president, occupied the
bead of the table, which was made in the
.-hape of a gridiron and around which
verÂ« gathered :wi) guests and the mem
ben ot the club.
As usuai. the unique features and dar
::ig burlesques, together with the good
i.atured Ekits aimed at prominent guests,
Junned the principal pan of the entertain
ment. Thete were interspersed with songs
by the quartet and solos and witty
t-peecbes, all making a thoroughly enjoy
. .c evening.
The menu was an exquisite affair, being
a little volume bound in leather, eacu
l>uge having the name of a member, to
gether 'with, his vignette set in a reduced
iront page of the paper lie represented.
It was designed as a souvenir of the rif
leenth annual dinner.
The initiation of two members was made
the text for a. burlesque on imperialism.
The club- "expanded' fcr the new mem
bers, raised the president to the rank of
Kmperor and "crowned" him. Reports
Jrom colonial governors and vassal States
and the conferring of titiles were rudely
interrupted by "Lncle Sam," who seized
the crown and drove the "decorated of
iicials" from the room.
A minstrel show with really new jokes
amused the guests. Several songs writ
ten for the occasion were given, a wrse
being allotted to Mr. Bryan with an al
lusion to "lt> to 1." Another lamented for
Senator Frye, because as president of the
Seoata he had to listen to Senators instead
uf enjoying his fishing sport.
The speeches were especially good. Sen
ator Depew and the Chinese Minister be
ir.g at their best, while the remarks of
Mcesrs. Bryan, Frye, Gorman, Chandler,
Tillman. Hanna and Beveridge were of
the usual high order. The speakers were
placed upon their mettle by the happy
Introduction of Mr. Weet, who presided
throughout the dinner with dignity and
ability. Among the guests were the fol
luwicg:
SesaXor Frye, president of the Senate;
Hon. William Jennings Bryan, Hon. Ar
thur P. Gorman; Wu Ting Fang, the Chi
nese Minister; Senators Depew, Bever
idge, Burrows. Chandler, Hanna, Jones of

SCOTT CONTEST
BEFORE SENATE
Arguments Heard by the
Committee.
ILLEGAL VOTING ALLEGED
?
TWO MEMBERS WERE NOT EN
TITLED TO SEATS.
?
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
met to hear arguments in the case of the
remonstrance against permitting Hon.
Nathan B. Scott of West Virginia to oc
cupy his seat in the Senate. The princi
pal objection to Mr. Scott, urged by the
protestants, was based on the contention
that he received only forty-eight votes,
or one less than a majority, and that he
secured his election by causing the sus
pension of two members of the Legisla
ture, who were afterward given seats,
thus reducing the membership from nine
ty-seven to ninety-five. .
The protestants also claimed that by ac
cepting commissions in the army in lSi>S
Geizendenner and Pierson respectively
vacated their office as members of the
State Senate. Without them Scott would
have had only forty-six votes, i Â¦
The friends of Mr. Scott contest these
points, urging cause for the suspension
of the twu members, and also snowing
that .Messrs. Uc-tzcmienner and Pierson
had resigned their ortices in the army be
fore casting their votes for Scott for Sen
ator.
The first speaker for the protestants
was Judge John Holt of West Virginia.
He urgeti that Cxetzendenner and Pierson
were absolutely prohibited by the West
Virginia constitution from the acceptance
of offices under the Federal Government.
They had the choice of retaining their
civil otllces or accepting the positions in
the militury service; they had accepted
the latter positions, and thus, ipse facto,
they had vacated their Slate offices. True,
the State Legislature had pronounced to
the contrary, but he contenued that it was
the duty of the United States to go be
hind the action of the State body. He
urged that, there was no way by which
they could again take their seats except
by re-election, which was not resorted to
in either instance.
The agreement by which the two
Houses of the Legislature arranged to
meet in joint session for the election of
a Senator and to disregard the contests
over scats, allowing neither contestant
nor contestee to vote, Mr. Holt declared
was corrupt, a violation of law, contrary
to public policy and a pitiable meddling
with a high function. It amounted to the
disfranchisement of two Democratic
members, who were afterward seated,
one in the Senate and the other in the
House. The. vote of the joint assembly
was reduced from ninety-seven to ninety
live, making forty-eight a majority. The
agreement was among the members of
the Legislature and was contrary to the
law and to public policy as well.
Mr. Holt devoted much of his time to
consideration of the right of the Senate
of the United States to investigate the
qualifications of the members of a State
House, holding that, as a matter of self
preservation, the Federal Senate was
bound to go behind tha decisions of a
State body. The qualifications of its own
members were involved and the Federal
Senate could not afford to say that it
would be bound by the conclusions of a
State Legislature, however foolish they
might be.
Frank L. Welles, also of the counsel for
the protestants, presented the reasons
why the committee should take further
evidence in the case. He called attention
to the fact that, while it was claimed that
Scott had been elected by 45 votes, a ma
jority of the protestants numbered 49
members of the Legislature.
HÂ» contended that the contests for seats
in the West Virginia Legislature were tha
repult of conspiracy on the part of the
managers to secure the election of Scott,
and that in some cases the contests were
insisted upon even when the contestants
did not want to enter them. Bloodshed
was even threatened by Republican State
officers.
Mr. Welles urged the committee, in view
of these contentions, to take testimony
and allow the protestants to prove these
facts. He said that conditions in West
Virginia wore as bad as had ever been
known in the South in the days of recon-
Mr. Welles said that a long: Investiga
tion would not be necessary nor would
many witnesses be called. Among- other,s
they would like to have the Governor of
the State called to testify as to his threat
to call out the militia to force. the recog
nition of a "Tump" Legislature.

THE CEMETERY QUESTION.
AN ordinance introduced by Supervisor D An
cona, by request, at the meeting of the Board
of Supervisors last Monday will have the effect
of reopening the discussion on the cemetery question.
The ordinance, which prohibits further burials of the
dead within the city limits after 1902, was referred to
the Judiciary and the Hospital and Health commit
tees,, and since the subject is one with which all arc
fairly familiar and requires little or nothing in the way
of new investigation, an early report upon it may be
Long ago The Call. pointed out that the agitation of
the issue would never cease until the passage of an
ordinance prohibiting further burials within the' city.
The enactment of such a municipal regulation may be
baffled for a time by the antagonism of special inter
ests; it may be delayed by conservatism, or postponed
for sentimental considerations, but sooner or later it
will be enacted. All considerations of public policy
are in its favor, and in the end these considerations
will prevail over whatever objections may be set up
Under any circumstances the burial of the dead
within cities or thickly settled suburban districts is an
evil against which science has made effective protests.
In ouiscase the evil is augmented because the ceme
teries within the city stretch as a barrier against the
westward extension of municipal growth. They in
terpose between the main portion of the city and one
of its finest and most attractive residence districts,
thus forcing a considerable number of persons who
would otherwise live in the city to seek homes in San
Mateo, Alameda or Marin counties. " There is, there
fore, a material loss as well as an injury to health in
the use of such large tracts of urban land for the
burial of the dead.
There arc doubtless many serious objections to the
closing of the cemeteries, but none that cannot be
overcome by a well devised ordinance. It will not be
necessary to injure any person in property or business,
or to desecrate the bodies of the dead held in sacked
memory by their surviving descendants, relatives and
friends. All that is required to protect every right
and to respect every sensibility can be provided in an
ordinance which will none the less put a stop to fur
ther burials. in these cemeteries and guard the.com
munity against the increase of an evil already great
The question has been brought before several suc
cessive Beards of Supervisors, but for one reason or
another no action has been taken upon it.. It would
be gratifying if the present board would mark the in
ception of the new era of municipal government by
settling the question. The closure, we repeat, must
come sooner or later, and this is decidedly one of the
cases where it can be safely said, The sooner it is
done, the better.
THE ATTACK UPON BIGGY.
WHEN Commissioners Newhall and Biggy re
fused to consummate Phelan's bargain with
Lawrence and Gunst, that Esola should be
chosen Chief of Police and the city turned over to
blacklegs, the first chapter in that disgraceful story
closed. The second began yesterday, when Lawrence,
through the Examiner, made upon Commissioner
Biggy an attack which reveals how much Lawrence
has at stake in the matter and how bitter is his malice
against those wh*b Jiave thwarted him.
In times past the Examiner has repeatedly com
mended Mr. Biggy and has borne testimony to his
worth in both public and private life. It turns upon
him now solely because he is a worthier man than
the conspirators thought; because he will not con
sent to sully his record by fulfilling the conspirators'
bargain and becoming a party to their nefarious
schemes.
The logic of the Examiner's argument of yesterday
was simply this: Esola is fit to be Chief of Police
because Commissioner Biggy conducts a laundry; he
should be Chief because Biggy's laundry is a large
one; he must be Chief, because otherwise Biggy may
obtain the position. That is all the argument there
was in the columns of words; the rest was but the
raving of a fool â hardly more coherent, indeed, than
the fury of an angry idiot.
It needed but that exhibition of virulence and vio
lence to complete the proof of the assertion of The
Call that Phelan had made a bargain to turn the po
lice force over to La.vrence to be used for Lawrence's
profit. In an open letter to the public Phelan ad
mitted that he had held conferences with Lawrence
and Esola before the election and that the selection
of Esola as Chief of Police was then discussed. In
the testimony given before the Commissioners during
the trial of the charges against Esola the same fact
was brought out. Lawrence himself then testified to
ii. Xow comes the outburst of rage which has
enough sincerity of feeling infusing the lies to show
that Lawrence had great expectations of profits to
be gained through Esola's chieftainship, and is hurt
and sore and malicious in his disappointment.
Not at any period of our history, has there ever
been a viler conspiracy to make use of official power
to plunder the city. Nothing ever done in the worst
days of the supremacy of Buckley or any other boss
was so base as this scheme to turn the police over
to the control of blacklegs and blackmailers. The
success of this conspiracy would have meant not only
plunder but the opening of the city wide to every
form of vice and rascality that would pay tribute or
divide profits with Lawrence and Gunst and the rest
The scheme has been baffled and beaten. Esola
will never be Chief of Police. His incapacity and
ttnfitness for the office were revealed by his own tes
timony on the witness-stand. When he swore he
could not recall meeting the Mayor and the Commis
sioners within two weeks, he showed the full measure
of his morality and his intelligence. He exhibited
himself as a small creature having but a low grade
even of cunning, and lacking in every qualification
for the position the co-operating blacklegs are seek
ing to give him.
In all this controversy not a single reason has been
given why Esola should be made Chief of Police.
Even now, when the Examiner, under the direction of
Lawrence, is pushing a petition in his favor, no rea
Â«*w is assigned for appointing him, except that he
ought to be vindicated from the effects of his own
testimony. That is alt, except it is -further said, with
much display of indignation, that Phelan promised
him the place, and that Commissioners who refuse to
give it are traitors to Mayor Phelan and to the new
charter.
It is evident the Examiner is to be used by the gang
to slander, libel, calumniate, malign and belie all who
oppose them. Such an exhibition raises the suspicion
that the Mayor nfey have been to some extent forced
to concede the arrogant demands of the disreputable
crowd by fear that if he did not the Examiner wouM
assail his private life and hold him up to as much
of obloquy as it could. Be that as it may, the Mayor
could not suffer more from the worst that Lawrence
can publish than he lias suffered from the exposure
of the bargain with him.
This second phase of the story is in some respects
viler than the first, if anything viler could be. Phelan
finds himself scorned by men who once supported
him. In the wreck of his reputation he seeks to keep
a dishonorable faith with the dishonored gang that
procured his election, and persists in his efforts to
carry out his bargain. It is bad work all around, but
honest men will not suffer, and Commissioner Biggy
r-eed have no fear of what Phelan, Lawrence' and
Gunst may do to injure him.

the latter being immediately next to the
smoker. .The draft in the corridor blew
the smoke from the cigar across the
younger woman's face, to which, although
it annoyed her extremely, -the smoker re

A SHOT THAT TOLD.
A Kansas City woman, whose hair is
gray, went to New York recently and took
a ride on a trolley car. Both of the side
seats of the car were crowded with men.
As she stood there, hanging to a strap and
swinging and jerking with the motion of
the car, she observed that all of the men
seemed to be entirely hidden behind their
newspapers. She thought, as she stood
there, that in Kansas City men often rise
to give their seats to women. The differ
ence was painful to contemplate. Finally
a negro near the other end at the car
stood up and said:
"Take this seat, lady."
"Xo." answered the Kansas City woman
with awful distinctness. "I will not take
the seat of the only gentleman in the
car." *<_
The newspapers dropped suddenly, and
six men Jumped-to their feet. Apparently
they had just seen the gray-haired
woman. And she took her choice of seats.

PROGRESS IN OAKLAND.
ONE of the most assuring promises of municipal
progress and improvement in Oakland is that
which is contained in the organization of a
Committee of One Hundred, composed of men of
light and leading, to conduct a campaign of education
in favor of issuing bonds for defraying the cost of
needed public works and enterprises. .From the ef
forts of such men it is certain that much of good will
result, and it is quite probable that within the near
future they may attain all they aim at.
No city in the United States, and perhaps none in
the world, has more- natural advantages as a place of
residence than Oakland. To the men and women of
our time, however, natural advantages are not enough.
The increasing culture of the world demands well
ordered streets, stately public buildings of every kind,
from courthouses to schools, attractive parks, thor
ough sewerage and handsome avenues and boule
vards. Wherever these are provided men and women
of culture and wealth from the surrounding country
congregate arid make their homes. Nothing pays bet
ter than such municipal improvements. The rewards
are numerous and varied. They come not only in the
form of increased 'trade and business activity, but in
that of augmented health and intellectual as well as
physical well being.
The movement toward the adornment of cities be
gan in the East years ago and has made such progress
there that some American cities are now equal to
many of the most attractive capitals of the Old World
in all that goes to dignify, a civilized community. The
spirit of that movement has reached California and
has begun to animate the more progressive element of
our cities. The overwhelming vote for the issue of
bonds in San Francisco is an evidence of the extent of
its influence, here. It is natural that it should be felt
in Oakland as well as on this, side of the bay, and
therefore the movement there' is in some respects an
inevitable outcome of the time and the situation.
The naturalness of the movement, however, does
not detract from the credit due to those_who have un
dertaken the work of advancing it. It requires time
and energy to overcome the inertia of large communi
ties. That was shown in the campaign started by The
Call for public improvement in San Francisco. The
Committee of One Hundred in Oakland will have
many a silurian prejudice to overcome and many a
jealous antagonism to conquer. They have under
taken a work as difficult as it is important, and to ac
complish it will need all the assistance that their pro
gressive and enterprising fellow-citizens can give
them. .
Fortunately for the promise of success the commit
tee is made up of men who are well fitted. for the
work.- Their personal influence is large and will as
sure for their enterprise a careful consideration from
the great mass of the people of the city. It is not a
partisan movement that has been started, nor one for
the advantage or interests of any particular class. It
is designed for the benefit of all, and therefore merits
the support of. all.

A PARISIAN
Engagement of Miss Bea
triceTobin and Charles
Raoul-Duval Is An
nounced.
An Interesting engagement was made
public yesterday, when Mrs. Mary A. To
bin announced the betrothal of her young
est daughter, Beatrice, to Charles Raoul-
Duval of Paris, France. â¢
The announcement came as a great sur
prise to the many friends of Miss Tobin.
Mr. Raoul-Duval was out here _ last
autumn on his way to the Klondike,
where he has many claims, and although
at th,at time tho young couple pllghtei
their troth the fact was not made public,
THE SUPREME ISSUE OF THE SESSION.
MANY measures are to be considered during the extra /session of the Legislature,
and many questions are involved in the Senatorial contest, but there is one issue
which overrides all the rest and dominates the situation. . It is the issue which
arises from the attitude the Southern Pacific Company has been able to assume, by the
connivance of Governor Gage, toward the Republican party and the State of California.
When Mr. Gage was a candidate for the office he now holds and was soliciting
the votes of Republicans he assured^hem in the most emphatic words, in the most spe
cific terms, with the strongest pledges and the most solemn vows, that he was not in any
way a creature of the Kentucky corporation, would not be in any respect subservient to
the dictation of the agents or president of that corporation, nor if elected to the Gov
ernorship would at any time sacrifice the interests of the Republican party or the wel
fare of the State through fear or favor of anything the railroad might promise or do.
All those pledges and promises have been broken. The interference of the rail
road in the affairs of the State has been more open and notorious than ever before in
our history, and the Governor has aided and abetted the work of its agents. He has
been so subservient to it that when he had under consideration the question of calling
an extra session of the Legislature he did not consult with Republican leaders either in
office or out of it, but with two officers of the Southern Pacific Company, Herrin and
Wright, both Democrats, and upon their advice 'called the session to meet within six
days after the summons was issued.
By reason of these acts of a Governor elected to office by Republican votes the
Kentucky corporation' is put into such a relation to the party that the corporation ap
pears very much like a dictator and master. The agents of the corporation no longer
make even a pretense at concealment of their political schemes and plans. They are so
openly and defiantly working to elect to the United States Senate a tool of their, cor
poration that not even the boldest liar dares to pretend that the railroaocUs out of pol
itics. Thus there confronts the Republicans of the Legislature an issue which they can
not shirk; nor ignore, nor confute. Either they are going to follow the Governor in his
betrayal of the party or else they are going to redeem the party from his rascality and
put an end. to the impudent attempts at domination on the part of Huntington's agents.
The extent to which the railroad has attained power in California is so enormous
that it is not strange its officials no longer think it necessary to conceal their political
schemes. That corporation controls and directs the State Board of Equalization, and
by the debasing service of that board escapes its just burden of taxation. The corpora
tion owns the Railroad Commission, and the Commissioners, who from their office are
expected to be impartial arbitrators and judges between the people and the railroads,
are known to resort to the officials of the railroad tp receive instruction and commands
as to what they shall do and what they shall leave undone. For offenses against right
and justice and duty not more vile than those which the Equalizers and the Railroad
Commissioners commit at the dictation of the railroad judges in other lands have been
hanged to lamp posts and impartial history has commended the hanging.
Here then is the situation. The Kentucky corporation controls the Railroad
Commission, the State Board of Equalization and the Governor of the State. It is now
making an effort to control the Legislature and through that body "to elect a Senator
whom it will control. It is time to grapple with this monstrous corrupting power in
earnest. From the struggle which is to begin at this session of the Legislature called by
the Governor at the dictation of the railroad there will come a decisive victory for one
side or the other. The corporation managers know it and will exhaust every resource
at their command to win. The people also know it and wait watchful to see what the

SACRAMENTO BEE
Although various reasons have been given for the calling of the extra session,
the State at large believes that only ono was potential with tho Governorâ the
election of a Senator of the United States.
In fact, the common view is that the extra session of the. Legislature was
called to present Daniel M. Burns with a high and honorable office which he could
never reach if he submitted his ambition to a verdict of the people of California.
It is not generally believed that Burns has many more votes to-day than he
had when the session closed. But this dilemma confronts those who do not
want to see California represented by a man who stands for all that is most
vicious in California politics: There are eighty- five Republican members. It
t-ikes Â«ixtv-one votes to elect on joint ballot. If part of the opposition to Daniel
M Burns should refuse to go into caucus and another part should enter therein,
a condition of affairs would arise which would tend to the advantage of Burns,
no matter whether he should have a majority of all the votes in the caucus or
only more votes than any other one candidate. If he should have a majority of
the caucus then the victory would be within his grasp. If he should have simply
more votes than any other candidate, the gods of chance would still favor him.
For the Dlav then would be to have the lowest candidate dropped on each ballot
and unless the opposition would be willing In a rush to center on some one man.

and every Republican Assemblyman to go into that caucus. But they should not

"PUERTO" GIVES
WAY TO "PORTO"
WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â The Senate
Committee on Porto Rico has decided, so
far as it can decide, that the Island whose
affairs it has under its particular care
shall be known as Porto Rico and not
Puerto Rico, as fixed by a recent execu
tive order. The question came up to
day in the meeting of the committee In
connection with the Foraker bill provid
ing a form of government of the island
and the decision upon the spelling of the
name was unanimous.
The committee went over the bill In de
tail, deciding upon many changes in
phraseology and some alterations in the
general provision of the measure. Prob
ably one of the most important changes
was to strike out the word "constitution"
wherever it appeared in the original print
of the bill, which extended the provisions
of the constitution as well as of the laws
to the Island. The change was made be
cause of the opinion generally expressed
by the members of the committee that
our constitution is not suited to the Porto
Rican people. The opinion was quite gen
eral that the extension of the constitution
was not necessary. Some of the Senators
expressed the opinion that the natives of
the island were not yet prepared for Jury
trials. --"Â¦Â¦Â¦ :.
Another important amendment provides
for the retirement of Porto Rlcan coins
and substitutes for them the coins of tha
United States. The Secretary of the Treas
ury is authorized to redeem the silver
coin known as the peso and all other sil
ver and copper Porto Rican coins now In
circulation at the present rate of 80 cents
in the money of the United States for
one peso. Another provision authorizes
the President to appoint an officer of thÂ«
army to be Governor of the island, not
withstanding any present law to thÂ»
contrary, but the appointment of such
officer is made optional with the Presi
dent. All laws enacted by the Porto Rican
Legislature are to be reported to Con
gress, which reserves the right to annul
them If considered necessary.
ThÂ« provisions of the bill relating to the
questions of the tariff, the Federal courts,
the internal revenue and a delegate In the
Congress of the United States were passed
over until a full attendance of members
of the committee could be obtained, one
or two of the members being absent dur
ing a greater part of the day. - â¢â¢ â¢Â¦

Copyrighted, 1900, by th# Associated Press.
BERLIN, Jan. 27.-Excepting that it
was lacking in court fetes the Emperor's
birthday to-day was kept "In the usual
way. Flags were displayed everywhere
and the papers published congratulatory
articles In which his Majesty was praised
as the champion of peace, the promoter
of civilization and the vigorous helmsman
of Germany's destinies.
The Kreuz Zeltung's house poet again
publishes his usual congratulatory ode.
The Center organs remind the Emperor
that the Jesuits are not yet recalled and
say he would earn- their everlasting
gratitude by signing the Jesuit recall.
The court mourning stops all projected
festivities among their classes. The Aus

the 29th, is off, and the same Is the case
with Count Schaffgotsch, Count Slers
torps. Count Beroldingen, Count Lerchen
feld and Admirals Tlrpitz and Sandebe
branden. All of these balls were to be
honored by the Emperor's presence.
Tuesday's, court reception, which was
the only one this winter, was more bril
liant than ever. The ladles' costumes
displayed unusual elegance, many of
them being of peculiar design, Dark
glowing velvet, with costly fur trimming
and elaborate, silk embroideries, were
especially noticeable. Among the de
butantes Baroness Wlede-Bachnostiz at
tracted especial attention by personal
charms, beautiful costumes and remark
able diamonds. The Princess of Pless
and Countess yon Goetzen, the latter an
American, were also specially remarked.
In the small American delegation Mrs.
Wurtz made a gorgeous display of dia
monds and pearls, e.ven outshining. Mrs.'
White's famous necklace.
Among the older court elements com
plaints this winter were especially strong
because of the rigid new court cere
monial, the style of reception being
c6pied by the Emperor more after the
court of St. James, old gentlemen espec
ially complaining about being forced to
wear knee breeches with silk stockings,
inducing rheumatism and gout. They also
complain at the increasing costliness of
the gala coats, which, for high officials,
now cost 1400 marks.
Munich celebrated the Emperor'a birth
day with a banquet, in which all the.Ba
varian Princes shared. The heir to the

Though Dr. Leyds, the diplomatic rep
resentative of the Transvaal, claims that
he oame here principally to celebrate the
Emperor's birthday, as in previous years,
the correspondent of the Associated Press
understands on authority that he also
came to consult with the German officials
about Portugal's alleged breach of neu

from the Delagoa Bay.

Body of the Man Murdered in Seattle
Identified.. .
SEATTLE. Jan. 27.â The body of the
man who was murdered yesterday on East
Lake avenue was identified to-day as that
of Charles Mohrbacher, a waiter. Not
long after the identification Charles
Shomo, proprietor of the Klondike saloon,
who lives opposite where the body of the
man was found, was arrested and charged
with Ms murder. Two little boys saw him
pick up a rifle, yesterday afternoon and
tire at a horse, they thought. He fired in
the direction of the spot where Mohr
bacher was found.
Shomo has complained to the police re-
iewly plowed field, and In some unknown
way was thrown under the harrow, re
maining, unable to extricate himself, for
several minutes. He was badly lacerated
about the body and head, many wounds
being upon his face, and for some time it
was feared he Tjad received fatal Injuries.
It now develops, however, that he will re
cover. No one can explain the cause of
the peculiar accident.
FAVORABLE TO DR. GILES.
Expert Testimony Given by Doctors
\ . . at Jackson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JACKSON, Jan. 27.â The testimony in
the Giles case was to-day very favorable
to the doctor. Dr. Gibbons was on the
Ftand until noon. He testified that the
wounds described by Drs. Endicott and
Gall, who held the autopsy, were probably
inflicted by the undertaker In the process
of embalming, and that these wound*
could not have been inflicted by the souni
said to have been used by Dr. Giles; that
death was caused by the bursting of a
blood vesselâ more important than any
that could have been affected by the
wounds discovered by the autopsy physi
cians. Dr. Hopkins of Fresno occupied,
the stand this afternoon and corroborated
the testimony of Dr. Gibbons.

Attitude of the British
Parliament."
OPPOSITION NOT UNITED
LIKELY TO DO LITTLE MORE
THAN CRITICIZE.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Preas.
LONDON, Jan. 27.â Though criticism of
the Government and its methods of han
dling the war Is unabated. It is safe to pay
that when Parliament meets next Tues
day morning nothing serious will" result.
There will be the usual motions of cen
sure, with perhaps more than usual im
passioned denunciations of the various de
partments of the administration, especial
ly the War and Colonial offices. But such
Is the patriotism of the average English
man and such Is the strength of the Con
servative organization that It will be sur
prising if Lord Salisbury's majority is
even appreciably weakened.
This mere tally of votes, however, must
not be construed as a real index of na
tional feeling, for many a man will go to
the Government lobby who outside has
privately declared some one ought to bÂ«
hanged for maladministration and that
If Cord Salisbury did not disassociate
himself from the system of culprits re
sponsible for the national humiliation he
must eventually take the consequences.
The Inner circle of the Government Is
perfectly "aware of such on eventuality,
but it has no fears for the Immediate fu
ture. Implicitly believing in a successful
climax of the war and trusting It will off
set the Initial blunders.
Another cogent reason for prophesying
that the session will be barren of changes
affecting the balance of power is that the
opposition apparently is hopelessly divid
ed. â¢ Nothing showed this better than John
Morley's speech at Forfar on January 24.
when for the first time he publicly
sneered at Lord Rosebery. who numbers
among his devoted adherents such bril
liant Liberals as H. H. Asqulth and Sir
Edward Grey. Lord Rosebery's magnifi
cent speech this week and the speeches
which he has recently delivered have been
convincing men of all parties of his ex
ceptional breadth of mind, patriotism and
ability to face a national crisis sanely,
and perhaps it is .not stretching the bow
to say that he to-day commands British
confidence to a greater extent than Lord
Salisbury. Yet it is Impossible for the
Liberals to unite on him, and, as the Sat
urday Review says, he Is so admirable out
of office that no one would risk putting
him in.
With Mr. Morley so bitterly opposed to
the Rosebery section of the Liberals and
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman such a
non-committal nonentity that his own
party press scarcely ever refers to him.
"the Liberals have no leader upon whom
to unite, even should they cohese suffi
ciently to make a determined attempt to
oust the Government; so it is probable
the opposition's tactics will be of the
guerrilla order, contenting itself with put
ting up Sir Charles Dilke and others to
criticize individual points and while not
directly challenging a vote upon the
morality of the war and the Government's
waging: of it, for fear of Incurring the ac-.
cusation of being Unpatriotic, achieving
the same end by vigorous academic criti
cism of the ante-bellum diplomacy, bring
ing up the Jameson raid skeleton and
demanding the production of the withheld
correspondence which was referred to by
B. F. Hawksley, counsel for Cecil Rhodes,
in the letters recently published by the In
dependence Belpe. This line of policy,
however, will not prevent the Irish mem
bers and most of the advanced Liberals
bringing to a vote most sweeping meas
ures of censure.
The Liberal leaders of all sections are
likely to abstain from supporting the war
itself: The war has now been in progress
over three months, and the British posi
tion is worse than when Parliament was
hastily assembled to grant supplies.

SAID WATER RAN UP HILL.
Judge Barry Decides a -Case From
Berna? Heights.
Justice of the Peacs Barry yesterday
rendered a decision in the case of John H. 5
Sullivan against Hugh Dougherty for
$299 99 damages alleged to have been sus
tained by reason of the negligence of the
defendant .in allowing an overflow of
storm waters to enter the plaintiff's prem
ises on Bernal Heights.
In his complaint Sullivan said he lived
at 2825 Army street, and that near his
residence he has a storehouse, which was
filled with "cattle hair In sacks, of great
value"; that Dougherty, who lives at 2819
Army street, dug a ditch from his house
to the storehouse owned by Sullivan while
the latter was away,- find on last New
Year's day the heavy rainfall caused vol-
umei of water to rush into the storehouse
and ruin the cattle hair therein stored.
It developed during the trial that Sulli
van's premises are situated some ten feet
higher than the house owned by Dough
erty, and Judge Barry was at a Joss to
know how the damage could have been
done unless the wattr ran up the hill.
"I was unaware," said the Judge, "that
water was in the habit of 'running up
hill.'"
"Well," said Dougherty, "this water ran
every which way, for while I was In the
basement of my home I even heard It
running upstairs."
The. , Judge rapped for order and re
marked, that 'he was always under the
impression that neighborly harmony ex
isted among the residents of Bernal
Heights. -
"Well, your Honor." said Sullivan, "Ber

was satisfied with the extra session if
the outcome should be the election of a
Republican capable of caring for the in
terests of California and Intellectually
fitted to take an intelligent part In na.
tional affairs. He believed it would be a
political blunder to elect D. M. Burns,
though he thought the extra session was
called in Burns' interest.
Business men who aro Republicans and
the rank. and file of the party are almost
to a man opposed to the election of Burns
and many have only unkind words to vol
untarily say of the Governor ror bringing
about a crisis for which there was not a
necessity.
HEALDSBURG, Jan. 27.â 1 think if
Burns receives the nomination the Re
publican party will lose the State at the
Presidential election this fall Just as sure
as fate. Barham is my choice. He will
represent the people and the people' 3 in
terests. I don't think the extra session
should have been called, but if Congress
man Barham be chosen it will be well
worth the cost. â Andrew Price.

The extra session will do great damage
to the Republican party. It would be an
outrage to elect Burns Senator.â George
D. Butler, attorney.
California is a great State and her sov
ereignty should be represented In the
Senate of the United States by her great
est men. . The Legislature should elect a
tru!y representative Californian, a man of
distinguished 'ability, and unsullied honor
and indisputable integrity. He should be
alike loyal to the people and McKinley's
administration and the best Interests of
California.â J. S. Beard, Superior Judge,
Siskiyou County.
It is the opinion of every man living In

Burns to the United States Senate would
be a political mistake.â Dr. G. W. Dwln

Â£-irâ 3HE Call yesterday printed three
pages of interviews with leading
Republicans in all parts of the
ji State on the Governor's call for the
extra session of the Legislature
and the fitness of Daniel M. Burns
for the position of United-States Senator.
The consensus of opinion was that the
Governor had no Justification for the
special summons and that the election of
Burns would be a disgrace to California.
The following additional Interviews were
received last night:
REDDING, Jan. 27.â Leaving out of con
sideration the opinions of those who fol
low politics for a livelihood, the sentiment
of the Republicans of Redding is almost
solidly against the election of D. M. Burns
to the United States Senate. With re-
Bpect to the wisdom or folly of calling an
extra session of the Legislature local Re
publican opinion is divided. Should
some man other than D. M. Burns or
Grant be elected, then the extra session,
in the opinion of the bulk of the local Re
publicans, would be justified. But if
Burns, particularly, be chosen, it Is felt
that it would be a serious blow to the
prestige of the State, an extravagant ex
penditure of the people's money to a pre
arranged end, and a death blow to the Re
publican party in California in the ap
proaching Presidential election.
R. M. Saeltzer, manager of the McCor
mick-Saeltzer Company, the largest mer
chandise nouse in Northern California, in
an interview expressed himself as em
phatically opposed to the election of Dan
Burns, and thought an irreparable injury
would be done the State should he be
elected.
. C. C. Bush Jr., cashier of Shasta Coun
ty, expressed the conviction that the call
ing of an extra sesison was a political
blunder that would culminate in the de
feat of the Republican party should D.
M. Burns be elected United States Sena
tor.
F. P. Primm, attorney at law and a
Republican who has given much of his
time to campaign work, favored the ex
tra session, but was opposed to the elec
tion of Burns, believing that' Burns' suc
cess would lose the State to McKinley in
the fall. Hi preferred that a new man
be taken up by the extra, session.
A. A.- is'ordyke, member of the butch
ering and cattle buying firm of Nordyke
& Newsom, believed the results of the
extra session would not Justify the ex
penditure necessary, and was opposed to
the election of D. M. Burns under any
circumstances. His election, he believed,
would practically destroy the party in this
State In the fall campaign.
E. A. Reid, vice-president of the Bank
of Shasta County, expressed the convic
tion that the extra session was called in
the interest of D. M. Burns, and that his
election would be the worst thing that
could happen to the State and the party.

GOVERNOR ALONE
OPPOSES SAVING
OF THE FLOODS
Would Not Name Plan
in His Call.
The Governor has angered the California
Water and Forest Association. He was
Â«qucsteÂ£ by every member of the execu
tive committee and every member of the
advisory council of the association, with
the exception of members who are also
members of the L*-giÂ«lature, to include
mention of an appropriation to help per
form the preliminary work for the im
pounding of floods in connection with the
Ooverr.xnent surveys in his call for the
extra session of the legislature. He re
fused. As a consequence the Legislature
wili have no chance to consider the ad
visability of making euch an appropria
tion at the session which will begin to
morrow. No reason has been assigned,
and the flood-saverÂ» think that they have
a y r y decided grievance and tbat a great
need of the State has been overlooked
and contemptuously pushed aside by the
Governor.
At the last session of the Legislature
what was kr.own as the Farnsworth bill
went through both houses without a dis
senting voice. That was to appropriate the
turn of $10,000 to assist in the preliminary
work of the Government surveys. The
bill was pocketed by the Governor. The
reason given was that it had not been en
grossed before the adjournment of the
Legislature and so failed to reach him
Â¦fIUUn the ten days' limit. No objection
was maue to the purpose for which the
menf-y was to have -been expended if it
bad been appropriated. Since tiie adjourn
xat-nt oi" tne Legislature the State con
wntJon has been heid in this city, which
resulted iii the formation of the California.
Water and Forest Association. The plans
of thÂ» association have been commended
by ail the newspapers in the State and by
all j.ulilic men; tne. banks of San Fran
cisco and others have contributed money
Bf a donation for the purpose of saving
the flood waters in wet years, to be used
lor mining purposes and irrigation in the
dry years.
': hÂ» fv incls all tended to make the
officers and advisory council of the Water
nr.6 Forest Association believe that there
would be no difficulty in getting the Gov
ernor to mention the flotKi-savins work in
connection with the call for the extra leg
islative session. What would have hap
pened had the appropriation been included
in the call may probably be guessed from
the unanimous approval given by the
members of the Legislature at the last
rcpular session of that body. Some ap
propriation would havo been made.
The officers of the Water and Forest
Association will not concede that there
Is a chance that they will fail to get the
money in time that is needed to help the
Government surveys, but they say that
the Governor has been the only man In the
State to give the work a black eye. There
has not been a project in late years that
has been so generally indorsed as the
flood-saving movement.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 28, 1900.
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS IN STATE POLITICAL AFFAIRS.
BURNS COLUMN BROKEN BY THE PEOPLE
Senator Burnett of the San Francisco Dele
gation Joins the Reform Forces.
M. R. HIGGINS WILL LEAD THE MEXICAN'S FORLORN HOPE
A6semblyman Cosper Serves Notice on Herrin That His Tulare Constitu
ents Cannot Longer Stand the Bailroad Programme.
Conference of leading Republicans.
THE Senatorial contest was enliv
ened yesterday by the arrival of
many members of the Legislature
and the open declaration of sev
eral legislators, who had been
claimed for Burns, that they
would never vote for the Mexican. The
resolute and fearless Republicans who
saved the commonwealth from shame at
the regular session last winter are confi
dent that they will win a great victory at
the extra session by electing a man to
the United States Senate who will reflect
honor on the State,
The forces of the Mexican are wavering.
Indications are that Burns cannot line
up more than twenty-seven votes. It is
asserted that Assemblyman Cosper served
notice on the Southern Pacific yesterday
that he could no longer support Burns,
as such support was contrary to the ex
pressed wishes of his constituents.
Cosper asked if the corporation had a
second choice.
Herrin replied : "I have no second choice.
It is Burns or nobody."
Cosper then asked: "Would not a vote
for Van R. Paterson be acceptable?"
Herrin responded: "No friend of mine
will vote for Paterson with my concent."
There is nothing in the wild talk of the
touts that everything was fixed for Burns
before Herrin directed Gage to call th-j
extra session. The long and short of it is
this: Burns is willing to take the gam
bler's last desperate chance. He knows
that he cannot go before the people of the
State as a candidate for the United
States Senat9 and win one Assembly dis
trict. There is only one chance lett for
him. and he takes it. He takes that or
nothing. That last chance is the extra
session of the present Legislature â the
Legislature which was chosen before the
people knew that he was a candidate for
Senatorial honors.
M. R. Higgins, formerly private secre
tary of ex-Governor H. H. Markham, and
subsequently Insurance Commissioner â¢of
California by grace of Markham and the
Republican party, knows that Burns as
an open candidate for the Senate could not
carry a district in the State. But Higgins,
who is one of the smoothest products
of a region celebrated for the production
of extremely smooth articles, has been
directed by Herrin to go to Sacramento
and manage the contest for Mexican Dan.
He goes presumably with the consent of
the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany, a corporation in which he holds a
high and lucrative position. Perhaps the
Southern Pacific is in possession of secret
insurance influence through which it may
order the directors of the Pacific Mutual
to scorn the memory of Columbus Water
house and send Higgins out to electioneer
for Dan Burns.
Senator Cutter arrived in the city last
evening and at the Grand Hotel met As
semblymen Raub and Greenwell. When
it was reported to the Senator that the
Burns touts all along the line from Her
rin to Higgins were claiming Cutter as a
new recruit the Senator said:
"I have declared one hundred times that
I would never vote for D. M. Burns in
caucus and now for the one hundred and
first time I repeat the declaration."
Mr. Cutter will introduce a resolution
providing for adjournment on February
10. He holds that all the. business can
be transacted by the time specified and
MONTEREY REPUBLICANS
WANT BURNS DEFEATED
(
SALINAS. Jan. 27.â The matter of the election of Dan Burns as Senator
is being freely discussed in this community. The universal opinion is that
such election would injure the Republican party materially in this section. At
a meeting of the Republican Central Committee of Monterey County this even
ing the following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the election of D. M. Burns as United States Senator will
prove disastrous to the welfare of the Republican party .of this State, and
our representative in the Legislature is respectfully but urgently requested to
spare no efforts toward accomplishing his defeat.
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be telegraphed to Senator Flint.
CUTTER TO INTRODUCE AN

Resolved, That the Senate is ready to

JURORS WILL GO
TO SACRAMENTO
Although the Governor named .sixteen
reasons and had one for calling the Legis
lature in extra session, the so-called crim
inal jurors of the Superior Court of this
city and county will furnish another rea
son if the Governor wants one. These jur
ors purpose making an effort to change
the law relating to the manner in which
jurors In criminal cases shall be paid,
and will take advantage of the extra sea-
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.â While there
has been something of a demonstration
of activity aiong the cocktail routes there
has been little else to show to-night
that the Legislature is to open in extraor
dinary session next Monday afternoon. As
if by common consent the better element
appears to have decided to remain away
until necessity required its presence. Up
to 8 o'clock to-night the choicest exhibit
San Francisco had to show on the hotel
registers was Jake Steppacher, the swish
and swing of whose signature seemed to
suggest his consciousness that he was the
whole thing. The later trains brought up
many additions to the assembling clans,
but there will be nothing here even re
sembling excitement until to-morrow
night or Monday morning.
The sentiments expressed In the Inter
views published In The Call to-day from
all sections of the State find a responsive
chord here, although with many Sacra
mentans it is not deemed good policy to
denounce in a public manner anything
which brings money to their purse.
Naturally the presence of the law-mak
ers and their retinue of politicians helps
the hotels, the. restaurants and saloon
men and puts some fresh money into cir
culation, and to this extent is a benefit.
But there are those who take views which
are not fashioned by the Interests of the
shopkeeper and these citizens are vehe
ment in their denunciation of the extra
session and the attempt to thrust into
the United States Senate a man whom the
entire State repudiates. It is true that
Burns has his friends here, but they are
for the most part men holding down good
political jobs and possessing a lively sense
of appreciation for favors to come. . It is
hard to find a reputable Sacramentan
with interests at stake who will attempt
to justify the action of Governor Gage in
calling the extra session or who has any
thing but abhorrence at the idea of send
ing to Washington a man whose presence
in the Senatorial seat will be a lasting
libel upon the State. â¢
The entire absence of anything like en
thusiasm about the hotels or anything
like activity at the Capitol itself betokens
the perfunctory manner in" which the ex
tra session is accepted. It is looked upon
merely as another development of the
plot to saddle Burns upon the people. No
body hereâ the seat of State government
takes seriously the fifteen supplementary
reasons assigned by Gage for the calling
of the session, and the enactments pro
posed in the proclamation when they are
referred to at all are laughed at as a
clumsy subterfuge to permit Burns to
make a final desperate attempt to seize
the. honors that he could not get at the
regular session.
estimates that the cost of the extra Bes
sion will not exceed $25,000. He is in favor
of balloting for Senator at the beginning
of the session.
Senator Davis will support the Cutter
resolution for adjournment If the date be
fixed for February 14- This will give,
said Mr. Davis, one week for balloting
on the Senatorship. If. a Senator cannot
be elected in a week no election can be
secured.
Assemblyman Cargill of Hollister is
confident that the Senatorshlp, if settled
at all in extra session, can be settled in
one week's balloting. He holds that the
Legislature must organize anew and that
the first ballot for Senator should be
taken Tuesday, February 6. Dr. Cargill
has been claimed for Burns, but he is
true to the people.
An Important conference of Senators
and Assemblymen who are not controlled
by Herrin and Burns took â¢ place at the
Lick House yesterday afternoon. The
conference .was called to discuss the ques
tion whether the Legislature shoula or
ganize anew for the extra session. The
members attending were: Senators Flint,
Davis, Smith, Gillette, Taylor, Maggard,
Stratton; Assemblymen Brown of San
Mateo, Knowiand, Radcliff, ; McDon
ald of Tuolumne, Merritt, Bliss and Dun
lap. The sentiment was almost unanimous
on the point that the Legislature should
reorganize. A committee of lawyers, con
sisting of Senators Stratton, Taylor, Gil
lette and Assemblymen Brown and Dun
lap, was appointed to look into the law
and precedents and present a report to a
session of a larger conference of legis
lators to be held at Sacramento. Senator
Flint, president pro tern. of the Senate,
was chosen chairman of the conference at
the Lick House. The Senatorial contest
was not discussed at the meeting.
Judge Dibble paw Herrin several times
yesterday, and acquired such fondness for
the society of Democrats that he closed
up his political work for the day by a long
interview with Sam Rainey at the Palace
Hotel last evening. The point is advanced
by Dibble that the session now about to
convene Is- an extraordinary session of
the Thirty-third Legislature, and that or
ganization already exists. He holds that
a constitutional amendment adopted by
the people since Governor Budd appointed
William T. Jeter Lieutenant Governor
makes the Speaker of the Assembly a
perpetual officer and provides that the
Speaker may become Governor in the line
of succession. Dibble says he does not
care when the balloting for Senator be
gins, but he is sure that a Senator elected
on the first day would be seated in the
United States Senate. He contends that
members may secure pay for an extraor
dinary session.
Many of the touts were rounded up by
Herrin yesterday. Hervey Lindley se
cured his instructions and will probably
go to Sacramento. If the programme is
not changed Burns, Lindley and Hlggins
will go to Sacramento this evening. Gage
was lurking around the Palace and Grand
.yesterday. There was a rumor that he
went to the capital on a late train, cross
ing the bridge which connects the Palace
and Grand.

SENATOR FRANK BURNETT.
SENATOR BURNETT
DESERTS BURNS
D. M. Burns' stronghold last
winter was the almost solid front
of the San Francisco delegation.
The forces of good government
and reform have broken the rail
road column and the confusion In
the camp of the Mexican ia a.
premonition of disaster to Dan all
along the line. The people through
out the State will hail with joy the
glad tidings that Senator F. W.
Burnett, grandson of the Illustri
ous Peter H. Burnett, first Gov
ernor of California, has renounced
his allegiance to Burns and Her
rln. The following statement was
made by Senator Burnett last
night:
"As I supported Daniel M.
Burns in his candidacy for United
States Senator at the beginning of
the recent contest, I believed It to
to be my duty to support him
throughout that contest," said
Senator Burnett, " but now I be
lieve my obligation to him ha 3
ceased and I shall not support him ',
during the coming fight. It is my â¢
opinion that It is for the best in- â¢
terests of the Republican party to "
elect a Senator to fill the now va- "
cant seat In the Congress of the
United States, and I am as fully "
satisfied that It is not for the best '
Interests of the Republican party
to elect Daniel M. Burns to that "
office. In obedience to the will of "
my constituents, who, almost to a ;
man, are opposed to Mr. Burns, â¢
and In view of the opinion hereto- Â¦
fore expressed by mo, I find it im- â¢
possible to longer support him.
"The- duty of a' public officer is to
his constituents. Although Mr.
Burns, who I will say Is a friend
of mine even now, doubtless ex- ]
pects my support during the com
ing contest for the vacant seat In â¢
the United States Senate, he total
ly ignored me and at no time con
sulted with me, nor was I con
sulted.with by any one during the
preparation of the slate. If you
may call It such, for the extra
session. It is not this that has
made me desert his cause, how
ever, but It is my opinion that
there are better men In the party
for the office, and my views are ac
centuated by the almost unani
mous opinion of my constituents,
whose wishes will not be ignored
by me. I am pledged to no man
and will go to Sacramento free and
unhampered; but believing that
there are better men in the party
than Daniel M. Burns I will give
my support in accordance with my
views on this matter."
sion to amend the governing sections of
the statutes.
A few months ago the demands of the
jurors, amounting to thousands of dol
iars, were repudiated by the Board-of Su
pervisors. Suit was brought to compel
the auditing of the demands, but the Su
premo Court held that the law was in
definite, and as it did not make the pay
ment of the fees to jurors mandatory the
jurors could not legally collect their de
mands.
A demand for a rehearing of the case
before, the court in bank was under way
when the extra session was called, and
the 800 jurors holding fee warrants decid
ed that it would be easier to change the
law than the minds .of the Supreme Court
Justices, and the former plan was aban
doned. In addition to changing the law
the Jurors will endeavor by statutory en
actment to get hold of the money in the
treasury against which they hold claims.
Attorney , Louis P. Boardman, counsel
for the jurors, will frame the bills, which
will be placed in the hands of the local
Senators and Assemblymen for presenta
tion to both houses of the Legislature.
HOWARD WRIGHT
WANTS TO VOTE
AT SACRAMENTO
Declares He Will Go
on a Stretcher. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 27.
Assemblyman Howard E. Wright says
that he is going to Sacramento and cast
his vote for Senator at the extra session
of the Legislature. He is determined to
go even it he taj to go on a coc.
The injuries of the Assemblyman have
proved very much less tnan was at first
expected. .Not only was there no injury
to the spine but his hip was only dislo
cated and not broken. He was in such,
good condition to-day that he was re
moved to the Fabiola Hospital, where hÂ©
will be given medical attendance. When
it was told him that he was to be taken
to the Fabiola Hospital he declared that
he would be taken to Sacramento in timo
to cast his vote on the Senatorial ques
tion.
The condition of Howard "Wright Is onÂ»
of the most interesting points in the Sen
atorial situation. Wright flopped from
Grant to Burns durmg the last session
and stood for Burns In the face of thÂ©
most determined attack. He is beingr
counted as a Burns man still, and If the
Mexican gets in a pinch the vote of How
ard E. Wright may become a very impor
tant factor in determining the future of
the State and the party. For this reason
the condition of Wright has become of
State interest.
Dr. R. T. Stratton. who Is attendir.gr
Wright, says that it will be impossible to
move him to Sacramento for some con
siderable period of time. He saya that
Mr. Wright sustained injuries to the liga
ments and tendons of the back and thigh,
that will necessitate the utmost quiet for
several weeks.
But Wright does not agree with his phy
sician. He declared to several friends
who called to see him to-day that he was
going to Sacramento If he went on a cot
and was carried into the joint session f>
vote.
It is quite certain that this method will
be pursued if it becomes necessary to use
Wright's vote, and the enly question now
Involved is whether the necessity will
arise.
Mr. Wright sustained a slight concus
sion of the brain from the collision with
the car. He says that he does not remem
ber being struck, but that his mind is now
perfectly clear.

ST. MARYS PARK
SCHEME MAY BE
A FLAT FAILURE
Charter May Operate
Against It.
?
ITS FRIENDS APPREHENSIVE
â ~Â»
CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS
MAY TAKE TOO LONG.
Borne trouble Is anticipated In the ap
proaching condemnation proceedings of
the property to be acquired for SL Marys
square, and grave fears are entertained
by the promoters of the project that cer
tain provisions in the charter may operate
against its consummation.
City Attorney Lane was granted author
ity last Friday by the Supervisors' Ju
diciary Committee to advertise the sum
mons for non-residents, and he expresses
his determination to begin active proceed
ings at once in order that the $75,000 ap
propriated for the purpose .may be utilized
before the expiration of the present fiscal
year. Should the money not be expended
before June 30, 1900, the appropriation
would be diverted to other uses and It
wouid be necessary to make a new appro
priation. In fact, this procedure has been
suggested as a way out of the linancial
difficulties in which the city has been in
volved for some time past.
Some doubt Is expressed as to whether
the condemnation proceedings can be end
ed In time fcr the purchase of the land
before the date mentioned. The courts
are proverbially slow, but Mr. Lane prom
ises to make every effort to get the judg
ments against the property owners so that
the success of the scheme may not be
Jeopardized. But Mr. Lane himself admits
that the proceedings will meet with nu
merous technical objections on the part
of opponents of the proposed improve
ment, and that the charter itself may be
Invoked to nullify the acts which have
made the Improvement a possibility.
Section 21 of the charter provides that,
"Except as otherwise provided in the con
stitution of the State or as otherwise pro
vided in this charter, every ordinance in
volving the granting by the city and coun
ty of any franchise for the supply of light
or water, or for the lease or sale of any
public utility," or "for the purchase of
land of more than $50,000 in value," rauÃt
be submitted to the vote of the electors of
the city and county at the election next
ensuing after the adoption of such or
dinance.
The City Attorney Is of the opinion that
as the word '"condemnation" Is not' used
in the section referring to the acquisition
of St. Marys Park is not affected by the
language of the charter. The constitution
provides that land may be acquired by
"purchase".- -or "condemnation," and the
latter means will be used in the park
project. City Attorney Lane will not ad
mit that the fact that the land must be
purchased after condemnation would bring
the matter under the terms of the char
ter. The fact, however, that there 1b a
legal doubt may, according to the expre9?
provisions of the charter fixing the limit
of expenditure in such cases at $50,0^0,
necessitate a vote of the people on the
question.
.An opinion recently filed by the City
Attorney may also be utilized by those
opposed to the St. Marys square project.
In this opinion Mr. Lane holds that "the
decision favored the position that the old
government of the city and county died
at noon on January 8, 1900, and that a new
government at that time came into exist
ence, therefore the incomplete acts of the
old Board. of ' Supervisors, so far as such
acts were based upon the authority grant
ed by the consolidation act, would not
survive and hold over under the newgov
crnment." . â¢ -'â¢' >
In this connection It Is held that while
the old board had completed its proceed
ings in passing the -resolutions covering
the proposed condemnation and the appro
priation of $75,000, the act Is Incomplete
because the money has not been exper.d
ed and the condemnation proceedings were
not finished during its official life. Mr.
Lane, however, denies that his opinion
just quoted In any way affects the St.
Marys Park proposition. . He claims that
the act of the board was completed when
the appropriation was voted for the pur
pose. The only danger that he can see
is that unlesa the mortey is expended be
fore the end of the present fiscal year it
may be diverted to other funds. To avoid
that possibility he will endeavor to per
cuade the courts to act with great haste,
and believes that. he will be able to ac
quire the park before the beginning of the
next fiscal year.
be treated with the greatest respect by
the men who" were hitherto czars
among the shippers.
No attention Is to be paid In future
to the gripman or motorman who un
feelingly and persistently sounds the
gong for the drayman to slide out cf
the way of approaching cars. Drivers
of drays claim that they have been
mortified long enough by this treat
ment," and one of the hopes of the new
organization is to regulate this great
wrong.
Freight handlers will be required, un
der the new order of things, to do all
of the work, while the members of the
association will occupy front seats on
the trucks, smoke good cigars and
drive the horses.
BOTH MAY BE INSANE.
Two Police Court Defendants Sent Up
for Examination.
Barclay Kenny, a grocery clerk, who
threw a brick through the window of the
Bulletin business office on Kearny street
Friday night and was arrested on a
charge of malicious mischief, appeared
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday and told
a rambling Btory of having been In the
Bulletin office Thursday when three men
tried to kill him. Friday night he was
walking along Kearny street and stopped
In front of the office and -lost conscious
ness of what happened after that. He had
no recollection of throwing a brick
through the window, which was valued at
$150.
The Judge thought he was a fit subject
for examination by the Insanity Com
missioners and so ordered, continuing the
case till Tuesday.
George Neustadt, the dishonorably dis
charged marine, who was arrested for
personating an officer, was up before
Judge Conlan yesterday. After hearing
the testimony of Addle Reltz, the girl
who was nearly frightened Into commit
ting suicide by Neustadt's actions, the
court, on the suggestion of the defend
ant's attorney, ordered that Neustadt be
examined by the Insanity Commissioners
and the case was continued till Wednes
day.
THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Pew Facts on the Same Subject.
We hear much nowadays about health
foods and hygienic living, about Tegetari-
anism and many other fads along the
same line. T 'Â¦â¢
Restaurants may be found tn the larger
cities where no meat, pastry or coffee is
served and the food crank Is in his glory,
and arguments and theories galore ad-
vanced to prove that meat waa never In-
tended for human stomachs, and almost
make us believe that our sturdy ancestors
who lived four score years in robust
health on roast beef, pork and mutton
must have been grossly Ignorant of tha
laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do
than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind from bacon to acorns.
A healthy appetite asd common sensÂ»
are excellent guides to follow in matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats Is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetable*,
meat furnishes the most nutriment in a
highly concentrated form and is digested
and assimilated more quickly than vege-
tables and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject says:
"Nervous persons, people run down In
health and of low vitality should eat meat
and plenty of It. If the digestion is too
feeble at first it may be easily corrected
by the regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal. Two of these ex-
cellent tablets taken after dinner will di-
gest several thousand grains of meat, eggs
or other animal food In three hours, and
no matter how weak the stomach may be,
no trouble will be experienced If a regu-
lar practice Is made of using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets because they supply the
pepsin and diastase necessary to perfect
digestion, and every form of indigestion
will be overcome by their use.
That large class of people who come
under the head of nervous dyspeptic*
should eat plenty of meat and Insure its
proper dl&estlon by the daily use of a safe,
harmless digestive medicine like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets composed of the nat-
ural digestive principles, pepsin, diastase,
fruit acids and salts, which actually per-
form the work of digestion. Cheap ca-
thartic medicines masquerading under
the name of dyspepsia cure* are useless
for Indigestion as they have absolutely
no effect upon tha actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia In all Its many forms Is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest food
and the sensible way to solve the riddle
and cure the dyspepsia Is to make dally
use at meal time of a preparation Ilk*
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which Is In-
dorsed by the medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples.
All drueyists sell Stuart's DyipepsU

Dickinson Confers "With Shafter.
Bodies of Dead Brought on the
City of Peking Claimed
by Relatives.
Aithouch the transport Thomas, bear
ing the body of the late Brigadier General
Henry W. Lawton, is not due to reach
this port for several days the members
of the National Guard are becoming anx
ious to learn General Shafter's intentions
in regard to the reception of the remains
of the gallant soldier. The National Guard
Is desirous of participating in any cere
monies that may be arranged In honor of
General Lawton's memory, and with that
object in view Major General Dickinson
yesterday held a conference with General
Shafter. Later in the day he addressed a
formal letter to the commanding general
of this department in behalf of the Gov
ernor and the people of the State, offering
to have the guard take part in any
ceremonies thai may be arranged. He
elated that he had available one troop
cz cavalry and forty men of the Signal
Corps, which could appear at any time or
place, mounted, lie would bÂ« pleased to
furnish them as an escort. He stated that
ne also had two or three companies of In
fantry available. Further, the United
fciates steamship Marion, In charge of the
Naval Militia, could be utilized for the
firing of any salute or salutea, on the ar
rival or departure or landing of the body
In conclusion. General Dickinson said that
he hoped to have the opportunity, togeth
er with the National Guard, to show this
measure Â«f respect for a hero whom he
had personally known.
Following this orders were Issued to the
Signal Corps of the Second Brigade, also
Troop A of the cavalry and the officers
t-f the Marlon, to be in readiness to per
form the offices Indicated.
From the arrival until the departure of
the body flags will be at half-mast at
every National Guard post in California.
General Shafter has as yet made no
definite arrangements for the reception of
the body and probably will not do so until
he hears from Washington. Whether or
rot there will be any public ceremonies
will depend largely on the wishes of Mrs.
Lawtcn, who is accompanying the re
mains home. The remains will be finally
interred in Arlington Cemetery, in Wash
ington, orders to that effect having Just
been issued by the War Department as
follows:
The rcrr.a.!nÂ« of the late Major General Henry
TV. Le.wi.ozi, who waa killed la action before

WHISTLES FOR HIS MONEY.
Leopold Mlkuletsh told in Judge Caban-
Iss' court yesterday how ho had been in
duced to part with J3 50 to Fred Kleve
last Thursday and for which Kleve waa
arrested on a charge of obtaining money
by false pretenses.
"I met Kleve In a saloon on Clay
street," said Mlkuletsh, "and he told me
he was a rancher in Napa and had a Job
for me. He told me I would have to pay
my own fareâ s3 50â and I gave him the
money to buy the ticket. He came back
with a piece of pasteboard on which waa
printed $3 50 and said I was to go to the
ferry and wait till I heard a whistle blow.
Then I was to present the pasteboard at
the gate and It would be all right. I
waited for about four hours and not hear
ing a whistle blow I asked a policeman
and he told me I was a fool and had
been bunkoed."
Kleve denied gettiner any money from
Mlkuletsh, and as Mlkuletsh had de
stroyed the pasteboard and there was
nothing to corroborate his story tha
Judge dismissed the case.
AN OPINION THAT AFFECTS THE
BETXRED LIST.
Changes That Have Taken Place in
the Naval Militiaâ Two Besig
nations â Several Appoint
ments.
Major General John H. Dickinson, divis
ion commander, will be in Sacramento
this week in attendance upon the extra
session of the State Legislature, going
there in the capacity of State Senator,
and while there he will be in consulta
tion with the officers at superior head
quarters with a view to accelerating the
return of the First Regiment of Infantry
to its proper status in the guard. Tl'e
men who on their return from Manila
were more or less enthusiastic on the sub
ject of being once more members of the
State force have become so much dis
heartened by reason of the dilatory meas
ures to reinstate them in their former po
sition that they do not now seem to care
If the regiment is ever mustered in. They
are of the opinion that fifteen months'
service in a foreign land, and a good por
tion of that time under fire, certainly en
titled them to being admitted into the
guard when they signified a willingness to
do so, but there is so much red tape in
trifling matters that they are beginning
to feel as If their services do not count
for anything. They believe that th^y
ought to have been officially recognized
as soon as they complied with the order
to report on the 4t>th of last November,
in view of the fact that M per cent or
more of the men were eligible to be re
ceived into the guard. They, believe that
after being officially recognized the work
of purging the rolls could have been pro
ceeded with in each company, and that
the regiment long before this would have
been what it ought to tie.
The meeting of company commanders
called last week by the ranking officer of
the First Regiment. Lieutenant Colonel
Duboce, at Second Brigade headquarters
was to confer with Major General Dickin
son and Brigadier General Wartleld wltn
a view to expedite the re-establishment of
the regiment. The situation was discussed
at length and there appeared to be a dis
position on the part of all present to in
duce the men to come into the company
ranks and comply with the requisite ex
aminations. In order that the technical ob
jections of the superior office may be met.
it is now thought that Inside of two
weeks the much looked for order restoring
the First to the guard will be issued.
Lieutenant W. E. Elliott was recently
appointed "assistant paymaster with the
rank of lieutenant"' of the Naval Militia,
vice Douglass White, who is on the Hart
ford on her cruise to represent the Naval
Militia of this Btate. Lieutenant Elliott
who was aid under Captain Turner and
under Captain James, has since he re
ceived that appointment entered into bus
iness engagements that will not enable
him to devote time to the mllltla. conse
quently-rather than perform duties In a
half way he has tendered his resigna-
Dr. Harris; surgeon of the militia, has
also tendered-his resignation, which has
been accepted, â¢ and â¢ Dn' Morrisey, who
ranked below him. has been appointed. to
fill the vacancy. Â¦ v - 'â¢ ' '

lieutenant." "^ -'. â¢ .â¢Â«"Â¦- ' "*'â¢" ' "â¢'".
D N. McMillan has- been appointed
pharmacist, on the Marion- and Richard
Schnclle boatswain of the battalion..
A great deal has been said of late about
the proposed encampment to .be held at
Santa Cruz this year, and therÂ© appears
to be a diversity of opinion as- to the ne
cessity of such a thing aa a camp. . The
recent war with Spain has demonstrated
to the thinking officers of the guard of
this State that what the men need more
than what .Captain Carrington of the
United States army, when Inspector of the
guard, once wrote of as "the picnic and
spectacular features of and sham battles
so common In National Guard camps," Is
a scheme for the entire season, outlining
the scope of drill and exercise for each
drill night, so that the scattered com
panies may keep up and each be ready to
take its place on an equal footing in the
regimental line. There are those who are
of the opinion that it would be wise to
have field instructions, frequently near
the armories, which exercises consist in a
peneral way of teaching the men the art
of marching under the trying inconveni
ence of dusty roads and" burning sun, the
takinp: of natural and the making of arti
ficial cover as protection against the en
emy's missiles of destruction: of com
manding officers learning to take proper
precaution? for the security of their com
mands on the march and in camp, select-
Ing proper positions on the field and
teaching the men to care for themselves
in ramp so as to best protect their health
and strength. Rather this than a camp
where for a period of seven days, at a
Rreat expense for transportation, there
would be nothing but a display of gold
lace and dress parade. Those who are not
In favor of camp say: "Teach the men
the practical, so they may be able to take
the field at a moment's notice; provide
for the regiments bo that they may go on
two and three days' trips to learn the
actual duties of the soldier several times
a year, and more good will be accom
plished than by having division, brigade
or regimental camps." And they add: "If
m*Â»n are under a uniform scheme of in
struction instructed in the -practical at
such time when it Is most convenient for
men to absent themselves from their usual
avocations for two or three days It will
Elve California a National Guard that it
may Justly feel proud of."
Tho Attorney General has rendered the
following rjpinion in" relation to counting
time for officers who have been placed on
the retired list:
In accordance with section 2003 of the Politi
cal Cod* a number of officers of the National
Guani who have not served seven consecutive
years ha\-e been placed on the retired list and
you deÂ«ire to know whether or not the time
th<*se officers of the National Ouard have been
on the retired list can be considered In com
puting the time served for the purpose of ls
pulng a certificate of exemption under section
IS3B of the Politlral Code.
In reply I have to cay under section 1D36.
Political frxio, as amended In 1897, officers who
havo faithfully served for the space of seven
consecutive years may be exempted from fur
ther military serrlce and Jury duty except fn
time of war. Un<^er section 20C3. Political Code,
as amended. In 18S7. that all officers disposed
of by reason of the act approved March 26.'
ISS3. "are hereby piaeed on the retired list with
the rank held by each when Euch act went Into
effect." The retired Met mentioned herein re
fers to section 1973, Political Cod 1 :, as amended
In IOT. Under the provisions of this section,
orncers disabled while In tl'e performance of
their duty and officers who have served faith
fully for a period of eipht years or for a period,
not consecutive, of ten years, may be placed
on the retired list. Under this section also It
Is clear that It was not the Intention of fhe
luw that the officers placed on the retired list
Fhould cease to be members of. the National
Guard, for under subdivision 4 of section 1973
they are subject to detail under orders of the
commander-ln-chlef and may be detailed for
active duty. They likewise keep their rank
If an officer !Â¦ placed on the retired list In
any of the medes provided by lnw and shall
faithfully perform the service* required of. him
under section 1973. I see no reason why the
period that he has been on th* retired Ili<t
should rot fee Included In the estimate of time
required for exemption undor section IJ3Â« Po
litical Code. *;. ' .
I am. therefore, of the opinion that It is per
missible-to compute the time that an officer
may be upon the retired list for the purpose -of
tssUinjr a certificate of exemption under sec
tion IS3S of the Political Code.

Fruit canners who are not In the can
neries combine will be even more severely
cinched in the prices they must pay for
cans than was originally predicted. The
increase In price instead of being $4 per
thousand is $7. The contract price to-day
is $23 and S2S 50 per thousand for two and
one-half pound cans. This will add at
least 8 cents to the cost of each dozen
of fruits or vegetables canned. On every
100,000 cases packed the increase is over
$16,000. A canner's estimate 1b that the in
creased cost to the fruit canners alone in
the State will not be less than $750,000.
At the same time that these facts are
developed the story is given out, on what
would seem to be excellent authority,
that the canneries combine has made a
contract with the three can factories of
the State to take all the cans that they
can make. It is not supposed that they
will all be used by the combined canner
ies. All they do not use will be for cato
to the people outside of the combine, so
goes the story, at stated prices. Tnl3 Is
firmly believed to be the fact by some of
the outsiders, and they allege that there
is an attempt to freeze them out of the
business. It is difficult for them to prove
that this is so, but the case makes up well
enough for their dissatisfaction. One es
timate is made to the effect that the com
bined fruit canners of the State stand to
make not less than $450,000 in the profit on
the cans they will have to sell.
Where the outside canners are to turn
to for cheaper cans is at present a puz
zle. The news originally and exclusively
published in The Call that an option had
been taken on the can factories of the
East by a Chicago concern, under whica
their output is tied up, Is a factor in the
case. Application having been made in
the East for cans, word has been received
that no cans are to be secured for early
delivery. In the meantime the local can
ning situation is about as bad for the out
siders as it possibly could be.
There are many canneries outside *>f the
deal. They are all in the same situation
bo far as the securing of cans is con
cerned. Pressure has recently been
brought to bear upon them to buy cans
early. This they, can do at the advanced
prices herein named. They are reluctant
to act, however, believing that every can
they purchase will swell the profits of
the canneries combine. Again, there is
talk about the agency of the tlnplate trust
in the deal. Mr. McCall, who is still in the
city has not developed any measure of re
lief'as yet. At one time it was reported
that he had a train load of machinery on
the way for the establishment of a can
factory If that is true the machinery
has not arrived, and all stories connected
with his supposed establishment of a plant
are looked at askance pending some more
positive proof of hi 3 intentions. - McCall
was connected with the floating of a can
manufacturing plant in London and is
known to be associated with capitalists.

HAD LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY
WHEN LAST SEEN.
A strange disappearance story was re
ported to the Morgue officials by Detective
Dillon last night. It concerns the where
abouts of Sergeant Charles O. Taylor;
formerly of Company D, Seventeenth
United States Infantry, whose home and
family are at present in Columbus, Ohio.
Sergeant Taylor returned from Manila
on the transport Newport on October 10
of last year. He was immediately taken
to the Presidio hospital, where j he re
mained until December 4. On the latter
date he was discharged and had in his
possession about $200. The last time he
was seen In this city was on the same date,
at the corner of Market and O'Farrtll
streets, when he parted company with an
other soldier, Charles Vitberger. On the
same afternoon he wrote a letter to his
wife, and since then nothing has been
heard of him.
Chief of Police Tyler of Columbus com
municated the facts of the case to the
police authorities of this city, and made
a request that every possible effort be
made to locate the man. He stated that
Taylor had been well connected and
known In Columbus, and that his wifo 1b

oK a little alley off Eighth street, near
j Market, is the headquarters of an mi
l stitution called by its proprietor the
"Union Mission Army," to which the
public of this State is contributing hun
dreds of dollars in the belief that it is
something which it is not. The so-caned
"army" consists of one man, A. W. Moore,
the "oommander-In-chief." who employs
his time largely in circulating literature
which is intended to create the impres
sion that the "army" is an organization
of many posts and divisions and covering
an ci. ended territory, and that it is dis
pensing a large amount of charity.
According to Moore's statement and the
testimony of others, it dispenses no char
ity whatever, while its "commander-ln
chief 1 admits the possession of a bank ac
count.
The so-called army shelter, as at pres
ent conducted, is an affront to decency;
young women of unquestioned respecta
bility, together with bums and Moore, liv
ing in one barnlike place, whose low par
titions render any attempt at privacy im
possible. The condition of the "army"
headquarters reflects the greatest possible
discredit on its manager.
For several months complaints have
been made by merchants of the importu
nities of Moore, while women once in "the
work" have called at the newspaper of
fices with complaints. The latest expose
of Mocre and his methods comes from
Sacramento, where the "commander-in
chief" has just completed a very success
ful financial tour. "While In the capital
Moore added one more chapter to his du
bious history. He collected money
amounting to over $S5, but when his mis
sion was discovered he was reported to
the police and soon after left town. "While
in that city he was recognized by "W. H.
Creswell, who at once wrote a public let
ter denouncing Moore's methods. Cres
well is an employe in the Southern Pa
cific foundry at Sacramento, and In his
letter he denounces Moore as a rank
fraud. Moore, the letter says, roomed at
Creswell's house in San Francisco, and
while there put on the uniform of the
Volunteer Army and solicited subscrip
tions from citizens.
Creswell asked him if he belonged to
the Volunteers, and the bogus general re
plied: "No; but you see the people are In
sympathy with the Volunteers, and by
wearing their uniform I can have better
success soliciting." Creswell, when he dis
covered Moore's character, barred his
door against him.
Creswell says he learned subsequently
that Moore was arrested in Portland, Or.,
for obtaining money by false pretenses.'
Creswell says he considered it his duty

from the male lodgers by a very insuffi
cient partition. The young lady cannot
fail to hear all the conversation of the
six men who are nightly housed, and as
there is but one entrance and no hall
way the ladies can only enter from the
street and pass to their room in full view
of the lodgers, around whose quarters
there is not even a screen. Frequently
there is no one at the "shelter" but Miss
Elsie Hill, and her natural refinement is
not calculated to render her an adjuster
of drunken soldiers' difficulties. Mrs.
Hill is a solicitor for Moore and a very
devout woman, but being in straitened
circumstances was glad to throw in her
lot with Moore. She has only been in
the place two weeks and already her
faith in Moore is severely strained.
Nora, to whom the "commander" says
he is engaged, is Mrs. Nora Miller, a
widow, who is cook of the institution.
She has apartments adjoining those oc
cupied by Moore. Moore recently pre
sented his fiancee with a handsome tailor
made gown, which the commander de
clares is the pattern of the "Union Mis
sion Army" uniform.
"Everything is perfectly straight and
square, said Moore. "I am no book
keeper, but I can show where all the
money goes. We give beds to six or
seven men every night and supply ten or
fifteen meals each day. The money I
have in bank was mine before I opened
this great work and is not, in any sense,
the property of the Union Mission Army.
I sell tickets to the merchants and re
deem them here with beds or meals and
It all takes money. I see that there was
a big surplus in December, but January
may be light."
Moore admitted that he Â¦ had engaged
Mrs. Hill during this month and that she
brings in several dollars a day, besides
goods. Last night six men slept at the
shelter and most of them had tickets for
which the merchants had paid. It Is said
that if the Volunteers or the Salvation
Army had Moore's Income they would
shelter and feed an average of thirty men
all the time. Moore shelters six and aver
ages three to five meals a day. There is
also much evidence to show that in many
instances men really destitute are turned
away unless they have a ticket or a dime.
Around the corner from the shelter, on
Eighth street, is the Mission Hall, where
Moore holds meetings nightly. A few
nights ago Moore had his affianced cook
with her little child at the street meet-
Ing. One of the child's relatives attempt
ed to carry away the child by force and
the police were called in to restore peace
in the family.
The commander, should he ever have
any army outside of himself, intends to
dictate the love affairs of his officers, for
this question is included in the following
questions submitted to applicants:
"Do you agree, whether in charge of a
post or serving under a superior officer,
not to keep company with a lady friend
in the post at which you are stationea
without first consulting the commander In
chief?
"If you obtain permission to keep com
pany with a lady friend, do you agree to
wait at least ten months before marry
ing?"
"I am not anxious for notoriety," said
Moore. "I do not seek it. The last time
something regarding my home was made
public three of my regular subscribers
told me that I need not call again."
DESPONDENT IDA
WILLIAMS TAKES
ROUGH ON RATS
Mysterious Attempt at
Suicide.
M. NIEBLING IS HER FRIEN
â¢
SAYS THE GIRL HAD TROUBLE
WITH HER PARENTS.
â¢
Miss Ida 'Williams, a young woman who
recently came to this city from Marys
ville. tried to end her life yesterday by
taking a dose of "Rough on Rats," in her
room in the Ah'born House, corner of
Bush street and Grant avenue. Two for
mer attempts at suicide on the part of
the despondent girl proved failures, and
It :s probable that the speed displayed by
the officials in getting her to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. G. H. Thompson
made good use of a stomach pump and
an antidote, will render her third effort
to depart this life by the poioson route as
abortive as were the other two.
For several reasons the police are puz
xled in trying to determine the cause of
the girl's suicidal mania, and the affair
is mysterious from various standpoints.
Michael Niebling, who came to this city
with the girl and her sister Kate last
Tuesday, visited the Receiving Hospital
shortly after the patient had been treated
Ly the physician and was taken to the
office of Capiain "Wittman by Patrolman
George M. Geiraan. He was in an intoxi
cated condition and toid such a rambling
tale that he was locked up for the nigh..
In the City Prison and charged with
drunkenness.
The two girlsâ lda and Kate "Williams â
came here last Tuesday and took a room
at the Ahlborn House. They were acÂ»
conipanied by Niebling. who paid their
hotel bill and frequently visited them.
Last Thursday the sister Kate left the
hotel, since which time the would-be sur
cide appeared very downhearted. She
was visited at an early hour yesterday
morning by Niebling, who departed in a
short time.
About 4 o'clock in the afternoon a clerk
named Schultz went to the room in re
sponse to a ring and found the girl lying
on the bed and groaning in pain. She
told him *:he had talit-n poison, when the
clerk rushed down and informed the pro
prietress. Mrs. Fcchemelcher, who
promptly telephoned to the Receiving
H'isj-iH.i;. An ambulance arrived and got
the girl to the hospital within a few min
utes, where Dr. Thompson administered
medical treatment.
Poiice Officer Geirnan secured two notes
left by the girl. One was addressed to
"Mr. Edward Dickhouse, Baiigor. Butte
County." and the other to "Mike Niebling,
Ahlborn House. Grant avenue. San Fran.
Cisco." Learning that Niebling had been
at the hoiei and heard of the attempted
t-uicide, t'ioimaii hurried out to the Re
ceiving Hospital just in time to intercept
his man.
Nkbling was so drunk he could hardly
talk, but in detached sentences managed
lo tell Captain Wiitman that this was the
:h:rd time the girl had tried to kill her
s< if. He said she lived four miles from
Baogor and that he- met her and her sister
Â«>n ;n<- train bound for this city last Tues
day. She was an old acquaintance and he
dei" raved her expenses because she was
penniless. Dickhouse, he said, was the
girl's brother-in-law. Niebling: declared
he was in nowise responsible for the sui
cidal tendency of the girl and believed
sh<- had had trouble with her parents. He
was locked in. a cell in the City Prison
and bookt'i as a "drunk."
The notes written by Miss "Williams
Â¦were so poorly written and spelled as to
b<=- almost illegible. In one envelope was a.
note executed by Dickhouse in favor of
herself for S5O. dated January 13, 1898, and
bearing interest at the rate of 8 per cent,
fche asked Dickhouse to pay the amount
of the note to Nk-blinp to remunerate him
lor what he had expended on her and said
he had been a true friend and was not re
sponsible for her being tired of life. "I
have gone to join little Tcmmie." she
wrote, "and hope you will always think
kindly cf me." Dickhoupe was also re
quested to deliver a letter of similar char
acter to her parents.
In her letter to Nnebling Miss "Williams
requested him to write Dickhouse for the
amount of the note and not to try to end
his life, because she had done so. She
seemed fearful h<? would make the at
tempt, and in three places in her letter
begged him not to think of such a thing.
"No one will think v.rong of you," she
wrote, "after you show them this letter.
Pep that my things are pent Kate. Good-
Ivy, darling, and a thousand kisses. I am
tired of life."
Late in the evening the girl was pro
nounced out of danger. She would talk
little to any one except Miss E. Beau
champs, me nurse, whom she informed
that she had bought the poison at Marys
vUto before boanling the train for this
city. She said she had had trouble with
her parents and was tired of life. Her
age sne gave as 22 years.
What mystify the police are the failure
of the pirl to refer to any trouble in the
letter 1* ft to be sent her parents and the
affection she seemed to bear for Niebling.
Â¦whom she referred to as her "dear
friend." and whom she feared would imi
tate her example. Why she should fear
Niebling would try to follow her to the
crave and should call him "darling." in
the light of hip declaration that she was
only an acquaintance, are questions both
refuse to answer, and it is believed that
the truth of the matter has not been di
vulged.
DEATH ENDS A
DAY'S OUTING
Miss Cunningham Is
Drowned at Bodega.
OTHERS NARROWLY ESCAPE
JAMES CAXTGHBY THE HERO OF
THE OCCASION.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 27.â Late this after
noon word reached this city from Bodega
that Miss Alice Cunningham, the beauti
ful and accomplished daughter of Judge
Cunningham of that place, had been
drowned at Bodega Bay. The little sea
coast town was at once communicated
with by wire and the details ascertained.
A party of young people started early
In the day for a sail upon the bay. After
visiting several points of interest it was
decided to take lunch upon a small island
lying a short distance beyond the heads.
One of the small boats was occupied by
James Caughey, Miss Mattie Roe and
Miss Cunningham. On the return trip
and when within not more than thirty
yards from shore the boat capsized and
the occupants were thrown into the water.
Caughey, who was an expert swimmer,
succeeded in placing Miss Roe astride the
upturned boat and started to take Miss
Cunningham to shore. Upon reaching a
point where the water was about waist
deep he left her to wade in the remainder
of the distance alone and started back
for Miss Roe. Reaching the boat he took
her upon his back and started in, but
upon reaching the point where he had
left Miss Cunningham a few minutes be
fore he was horrified to find her dead body
lying in the shallow water. The young
lady had evidently fainted after being
left alone and drowned for lack of as
sistance while Caughey was making his
second trip to the overturned boat.
The sad affair caused the deepest gloonv
in Bodega, where the young lady was well
known and was a general favorite.
Caughey was badly bruised by being
struck by the plunging boat while try
ing to put it on an even keel. His face
was badly cut and his ear torn. The en
tire party is heart-broken at the sad end
ing of the day's pleasure. Coroner Pierce
of Sebastopol was notified, but decided
not to hold an inquest. A death certifi
cate was Issued this afternoon by Dr.
Bruce Cockerill of Bloomfield and the
funeral will be held Monday at 10 o'clock.
The interment will be at Sebastopol. Miss
Cunningham was 19 years of age. Mr.
Caughey did heroic work and many words
of praise are heard of his noble effort.

Sixth-street bridge, at $60, Edward Dun
ning.
The board decided to meet the Civil Ser
vice Commission to-morrow at 4 p. m. to
arrange the proper classification of the
places of employment under its control.
A numerously signed communication
was read, to the effect that the quarry
maintained by Qulmby & Harrelson. on
to inform the public so as to prevent
Moore from further robbing It, as he is
unng the money for his own benefit.
"He suggested " to my husband," said
Mrs. Creswell in an interview, "that he
should put on a suit like his and collect
money as he did, saying that then my
husband would not have to work any
more. We would not let him stay in our
house after we found what kind of a man
he was."
Moore was at his "headquarters," Man
ning place, Friday afternoon. He resent
ed, at first, any request for a few facts
concerning his "shelter."
"You will have to go elsewhere for
facts," Â«aid he. "Do you think I'm green
and know nothing? Do you think I came
over from Ireland yesterday?"
After spending nearly an hour extolling
his virtues and his desire that the news
papers should not crush hts "work,
Moore consented to produce his books.
They are kept in the crudest form and
show him to be alike ignorant and shift
less. A hasty summing of the receipts for
one month showed that Moore had receiv
ed f-46 in San Francisco. No mention was
made of money collected in other cities.
The total disbursements were $139, show
ing promts for the month of $109. .
Moore's blanks and posters are grossly
misleading. They assert that the "Union
Mission Army" is a vast organization.
Applicants for membership in the "army"
are furnished with blanks to till out and
sign. The accompanying Instructions
state that "this form must be signed by
the officers in charge of the post in which
you are a candidate for training, and
when signed is to be forwarded to the
commander-in-chief, who will submit It to
the Grand Field Council, the latter ac
cepting or rejecting the applicant by a
two-thirds vote."
"Where is the Grand Field Council?"
Moore was asked.
"There is none."
"Who made you commander-ln-chief?"
"I commissioned myself."
"To whom are you responsible?"
"To myself."
"How much property is there In this
place?"
"It would require $600 to duplicate It."
"Could you wind up this business at
once if you chose?"
"I could."
"If you did shut down, to whom would
this property belong?"
"To me, solely."
"Will you incorporate?"
"I am In no hurry. I might get a board
of directors unfavorable to me."
"Are you married?"
"Not yetâ about as good as married. I
am engaged to Nora, the cook."
"Have you a bank account?"
"I have, but it is purely a personal af
fair."
"Were you arrested In Portland?"
"I was, and was detained for forty
days, but was never tried. Ballington
Booth set the matter right."
Moore admitted he Is commander, army,
auditor, cashier, grand Held council, in
fact, the whole thing, an expanded
Poohbah without precedent.
"Commander" Moore has recently en
gaged the services of a Mrs. Hill, the
wife of a minister in the Illinois confer
ence. Mrs. Hill has her daughter with
her, a charming and talented young
lady, who has no sympathy with the
"work." Mrs. Hill and her daughter room
in one corner of the "shelter," separated
MAY ERECT STANDS.
Chinese Granted Some Concessions by
Acting Chief of Police.
Acting Chief of Police Biggy has an
nounced his intention of permitting the
Chinese to erect temporary stands in the
streets on which to hold their New Year
festivities. He will also permit celebra
tions in private houses. The explosion ->f
fireworks of any description in the street,
however, has been strictly forbidden.
Many other privileges which have been
accorded Chinese in years past will now
be denied them on account of their atti
tude in the highbinder war and until they
conclude to accede to certain demands
made by the police.
Biggy states that he will meet the
representatives of forty tongs next week
and will press his demands upon them.
He says that at the present time twenty
two of the organizations are willmg to
give the names of their leaders, but that
eighteen tongs of the Sam Yups are hold
ing out. If his terms are not agreed upon
the acting Chief will retain the present
force of police In Chinatown and continue
to make things merry for the Mongolians.

22How He Appears Now to the Blackmail
ers Who Could Not Use Him.
BIGGY BEFORE AND AFTER THE CONTEST
He Was P ctured as the Personification
of Honor in Public Life.
In seeking to punish Commissioner Will
iam J. Biggy because he would not sell
his manhood that newspaper admits, or
rather seeks In every possible way to
prove, that before election Mayor Phelan
exacted from the Police Commission a
promise to vote for F. L. Esola for Chief
of Police. Proof is given that the con
spiracy was hatched, planned and per
fected before Mayor Phelan was e'ectcd
in November, and that subsequent to his
election and up to the very present nio
ment he has striven in ways dishonorable
and discreditable to make his trickster's
scheme a success. From the camp of his
own friends, therefore, from the very
newspaper that opened its columns to his
denial of a criminal act which did n~t
deny came the announcement, startling
as it must be to the people of San Fran
cisco, that he Is a dishonest official, un
worthy of the post he occupies.
The motive which drew forth these re
markable admissions of yesterday are of
comparatively minor consideration. The
one point of vital importance to the people
of San Francisco is the final proof that
Mayor Phelan bargained before his elec
tion to deliver the Police Department of
this city as a commodity to be used as the
purchaser saw fit and to be manipulated
as criminal influence dictated. It is of
importance to the people of San Francisco
to know that these conspirators, with
Mayor Phelan still In the lead, are yelping
In chagrin at the failure of their scheme.
It Is of Importance to know that the col
umns of a corrupt newspaper are still free
to be used for furthering the success of
his scheme and will continue to be opened
until a decent public opinion and honest
officials who prize their manhood drive
the conspirators into obscurity.
If there has been at any time since The
Call began Its expose of thl3 gigantic con
spiracy the shadow of doubt It has been
removed, and the issue Is now perfectly
plain. The Police Commissioners can no
longer evade the serious issue presented
to them. The organ of Mayor Phelan has
cent broadcast the Information that they
were elected as the tools of the.conspira
tors into whose hands he had delivered
them. As a matter of simple justice to
themselves they must assert their own In
dependence and dictate their own policy.
Any other course will brand them as men
unworthy of confidence and public place.
The startling- statement of Commis
sioner Blggy in reference to the terms
upon which the compromise report on
Esola was adopted occasioned widespread
comment yesterday. The document was
straightforward, direct and clear. It re
cited incidents that had actually hap
pened, and it related conclusions that had
already been reached. In an effort to
obtain the opinions of the other Commis
sioners. Commissioner William Thomas
was seen yesterday. In obedience to the
contract through which he obtained a
public position and under which he makes
the backer of an obscure, ignorant, in
efficient and incapable lieutenant the cus
todian of his honor and good name, Mr.
Thomas declines to say anything that
means anything. He has with his right
and privilege of action sacrificed his free
dom of opinion and evidently prefers to
wait until he receives permission from
his keeper before he will talk to the point
upon the vital question at Issue. In an

has been false to every promise and every

the dirty wash which John D. Spreckels tosses
at him. Nothing in the line of fairness can be
expected from niggy. but there Is hope In an
appeal to the honor and manhood of his fellow
Commissioners who regard him with the con
tempt he deserves. His reason for wanting the
place, aside from the satisfaction of his desire
to peacock before the community, lies In the
fact that the Chief Is paid Â«40<>O a year, while
his pay ns a Commissioner is only $100 a month.
As the commission Is bow constituted Dlggy is
making a hopeless fight, bat his shameless

his appointment as Police Commissioner. Btggr
said freely that he favored Esola's appointment
as Chief of Toliee. He was frequent and appar

he could not be dragged away from Esola's sup

promised to support. As Commissioner his sal

interview yesterday he said:
"I will make a statement which I do
not believe The Call will publish. I con
sider that I am still bound by my honor
not to divulge or discuss anything that
transpired during the executive sessions
of the Police Commission. I do not be
lieve Mr. Biggy's actions relieve me In
any way from my obligation. Further
than this I have nothing to say regarding
the affairs of the Police Commission or
the course taken by Mr. Biggy. I will
neither deny nor affirm any of his state
ments, and any questions on that linÂ»
which may be asked of me will be a
useless waste of breath."
In theso words Commissioner Thomas
takes his position before the people of
San Francisco. Commissioner McNutt
was hardly more explicit.
Dr. McNutt's mind does not appear to
be clear on any particular subject except,
perhaps, that he is waiting for orders to
dictate his official action.
"I do not care a copper farthing why
Mr. Biggy signed the contract." he aald,
"ot whether or not he understood that it
was a compromise measure or if any
promises to that effect were made to him.
I certainly did not make any such promise
to him, and If any one else did It is no
business of mine. I know why 1 signed
the verdict and I am interested no fur
ther. I did not believe the charges were
proved and do not believe so now."
"Do you know," Dr. McNutt was ask
ed, "that any member of the board or that
anybody not of the board submitted the
verdict on condition that Esola's name be
withdrawn?"
"No proposition was made to me," was
Dr. McNutt's reply. "It was not neces
sary, and this is as fiir as I will discuss
that phase of the question."
"Do you consider that Esola Is still a
candidate for the office of Chief of Po
lice?" the Commissioner was asked.
"I have. never heard that he was official
ly withdrawn," was the answer. "We
have not disposed of the other applicants
for the place nor have we fully considered
the suggestions that have come to us from
all directions. It seems to mo that every
body is a candidate for the position. I
have never promised my vote to any one,
and as a matter of fact really do not
know who is a candidate."
The dexterity with which the learned
physician handles the truth would suggest
that he missed his proper sphere of use
fulness in not becoming a juggler.,
"Since you say you have not promised
your vote to any one," he was asked,
"will you deny that some one else has
promised it for you?"
Dr. McNutt was quite as shy of this
question as he had been of the other. "I
believe It Is my duty," he said, "to do the
best 1 can for the Mayor and to do every
thing In my power to help along his ad
ministration."
The physician has the very Interesting
faculty of making himself delightfully
absurd. He was asked if Colonel Sullivan
had not been suggested as a compromise
candidate and If the board was not con
sidering the candidacy of the Mayor's sec
retary. Dr. McNutt's answer would en
title him to a mark of distinction as a
manipulator of the truth.
"Well, really I don't know," he said, "I
am not officially aware that he is a can
didate, but I am sure he would not refuse
the job If it were offered to him. In that
respect he is like a great many others in
this city. The day after I was appointed
a Commissioner by Mayor Phelan I hired
a Federal detective to look up the records
of every one who had been
mentioned In the newspapers as
candidates for the office of Chief.
I was perfectly new at the business
then and the Information I received was
of assistance to me." Commissioner Mc-
Nutt did not discuss the information he
received or the impressions he felt when
Frederick L. Esola deliberately perjured
himself upon the witness stand and at
tempted to drag the members of the
Police Commission down to his low level
of cheap cunning.
Dr; McNutt seems to have overlooked
a very rich field In his search for Inform
ation. -He need not have hired Federal
detectives to assist him, but might have
gone to the record of the Police Depart
ment Itself and would have obtained In
formation that would have made him
wiÃer and perhaps sadder. He could have
looked over the records of the department
since Frederick L. Eaola has been ap
pointed. He could have begun with
Esola's scrawling, almost Illegible and
ungrammatical application for a position
on the police force. The Commissioner
could have searched through those re-
ports and could have found scores of
proofs of Esola's illiteracy, incompetency
and stupidity.
ESOLA WRITES HIS OWN PROOF OF HIS INCOMPETENCY.
â¢ Among the records of the Police 2>epartment are many reports, requests, petitions and suggestions â¢
! written by Esola. These documents are proof absolute of the ignorance, incapacity and audacity of the "
â¢ presumptuous lieutenant. Several are reproduced in fac simile to establish these facts and to show that 'â¢
; Esola spent much of his time, for which the city paid, at the racetracks. One of the letters above, that '
which shows on its face some knowledge of penmanship and which is signed "Esola, Lieut.," waa !
\ not written by the lieutenant, but by an officer to whom he delegated the serious task of writing.
The Commissioner could have inspected
application after application from Lieu
tenant Esola to desert his desk, neglect
his duty and Impose upon his '"pull" to at
tend the races with his friends. Dr. Mc-
Xutt can find among these records also.
If he cares to look, evidences of the fact
that the presumptuous lieutenant, who
wants to be Chief of Police, cannot make
out a report that a child in knickerbock
ers could not surpass. Dr. McNutt can
find among the records the absolute proof
that all of the reports emanating from,
the division in which Esola is a lieuten
ant have been made out by subordinates,
very frequently patrolmen, whenever the
reports were of importance.
The Commissioner can there find to a
demonstration that Eaola Is not only In
competent for the position he seeks but
unfit for the office he holds. And if Dr.
McXutt has as keen a sense of the pre
postercus as his dawdling with facts
would suggest he can see how eminently
disqualified the Mayor's candidate is for
the office of Chief of Police. If Dr. Mc-
Nutt will take this trouble he will save
himself the expense of any further em
ployment of Federal detectives.
In order that these very interesting re
ports and requests and appeals to his su
periors may show for themselves several
of them are reproduced. The frequency
In which the ambitious lieutenant asks
leave to attend the races would suggest
that he was a happy possessor of a season
pass to the tracks. As Chief of Police he
would no doubt be an adornment to the
grand stand at Tanforan.
When the newspaper backer of Esola
took up the cudgel to belabor Commis
sioner Biggy, and overshooting Its mark,
struck Mayor Phelan, It Instituted a
series of Interesting comparisons with
Itself. For over four years the Examiner
has loat no opportunity to praise the pub
lic life of William J. Blggy. It has given
him columns of editorial indorsement and
has exhausted Its vocabulary of well
wishes in his behalf. This policy con
tinued until a very few months ago. or
more correctly speaking, until yesterday,
when the vocabulary of abuse was
brought Into requisition and Blggy waa
as roundly abuaed as he had been highly
praised. The conclusion Is plain.
"When the Examiner praises anybody it
has either used him or wants to use him.
When it denounces a man hiffh In publia
life or respected In private life the con
clusion Is Inevitable that the recipient
of these favors has refused to sell hia
honor to the blackmailers who dictate
the policy of the Examiner. That this
may show for itself The Call presents
this morning In parallel columns the opin
ion entertained b. the Examiner of Wil
liam J. Biggy before and after he waa

Startling Revelations of
Esola's Mendacity and
Incompetency Among
the Official Records
at the City Hall.
â¢
EXSATIOKS are following
/r^ quickly, one upon the other,
In the affairs of the Police
Ig^ Jjf Commission and in the_ scan-
dal .-us scheme concocted tc
The latest surprise, and one
of the greatest in the case, was sprung
yesterday, when the conspirator?, made
desperate by the failure of their scheme
and the forced retirement of the pre
eumptuous lieutenant, confessed the ex
istence of the plot which The Call has
charged and which it offered to prove in a
court of justice. The newspaper in which
Esola has found his only support shame
lessly acknowledged that Mayor Phelan
had made a criminal ante-election com
pact to appoint Police Commissioners
Â¦whose sole qualification for office and
whose only obligation would be to elect
Esola Chief of Police.
That newspaper, which has resorted to
every artifice and trick to accomplish
Esoia's election, declared yesterday that
Mayor Phelan had been betrayed because
one of the Police Commissioners had not
kept the pledge which had been exacted
from mm before his appointment, and
which was an incident to the bond which
Mayor Phelan had given before his elec
tion in exchange for the support of that
newspaper. This shameful confession
came like a bombshell, as it was hardly
to be expected that the conspirators would
be indiscreet enough to sacrifice their
arch conspirator, the Mayor, and expose
through their own admissions the gigan
tic plot which blasted the political future
of his Honor and brands him as a man
f unk enough to stoop to the lowest polit
ical pool and drag his name and his char
acter and his reputation as an honest man
through its foulness, that he might win
political success.
But In the failure of their cherished
conspiracy the schemers had evidently
lost their h^ads. and yesterday the pub
lic of San Francisco needed tÂ« look nÂ»
further than the columns of the iocal yol
low jourr.aJ to see the proof, absolute and
conclusive, of what The Call was ready
to prove In court. That that newspaper
was forced to stultify itself and to reveal
itself In all Its insincere, greedy, private
selfishness was only an incident In the af
fair. That the manipulators and managers
of the shfcvt were compelled to show the
people of San Francisco that the yellow
journal has but one policy, and that one
of self-aggrandizement, was hardly to be
expected under any but the most serious
circumstances, but the interesting fact re
mains that the organ of Mayor Phelan
has now stamped him as an unworthy po
litical trickster, who has used his power
end his office to pander to his selfish am
bition and to prostitute the great institu
tion of San Francisco to criminal uses.

changes are as fullows:
Exchanging of lists of possible candi
dates shall be done by faculty committees
three weeks before the datÂ»* of contest
and any one not on the list shall ba

After 1900 the annual football game
shall be held the second Saturday in No
vember, and after 1900 all intercollegiate
contests shall be held on college grounds.

agreement is to last five years, expiring
December 31, 1904. and may be changed
after ratification by the student athletic
committees by the consent of. both bodies.
Amateurs will be classed under rules
laid down by A. A. U. A student must
have been six months in the university
before competing. Limited students in
the University of California must have
the same entrance qualifications as par
tial students at Stanford. All contestants
must be registered twenty-five days after
the beginning of instruction.
No person drawing a salary from the
university other than by manual labor
shall be allowed to compete. No person
drawing a salary from a student body
position shall compete. No student who

GLEE CLUB DEFEATED
BY THE FOOTBALL MEN
BERKELEY. Jan. 27.â The annual base
ball pame between the glee club and the
football team resulted as disastrously for
the- former as their recent jaunt to the
wfbfoot country. The main features of
the game were the score, 25 to 15, and the
prror.s. which were not computed. The
football battery displayed a show of vul
par professionalism very displeasing to
the Klee club men.
"Aw, don't throw 'em so hard," said
Rrick Morse, "we don't want to play that
way."
Latr-r. however, the singers bracod
themselves and hit Whipple very freely.
Their great difficulty in making the rounds
of the basos was the irrepressible propen
sity of the ranvasbacks for tackling the
runners as they wrnt by. Womble was
a particular offender in this respect. He
fwrmd to dive for a man's knees ts in-
Ftinctivfly as a cat j'imps at B. mouse.

FOR FREEDOM
IS TRIED AT
UNION PARK
The Great English Greyhound
Runs in Great Form.
Other Courses.
J. 11. Rosseter's celebrated Imported
greyhound For Freedom was tried out
yesterday at Union Coursing Park. It was
his first course since he won the John
Grace challenge cup last February. He
has had only rough preparation, and is far
from being on edge, yet he ran In great
form. Ho was tried with J. Murnane a
Wildwood, which he led by five lengths
to the hare. He ran up a score of 13 to
4, showing the speed all the way. As it
was not deemed advisable to run the big
dog too long, a number of relief dogs
were released. He outfooted these until
the hare was killed.
He will be given another opening up
run this 'afternoon.
â¢ Over one hundred courses were run
yesterday. There was an unusual number
in which the dugs ran unsighted on their
game owing to weather conditions. In
addition to. this there were a number of
undecided courses where the score was
equal. There were many surprises in the
running, iiohe, which won tne big open
stane last Sunday, was beaten by Beauty
Spot. Bohe ruled a 4 and 5 to 1 favor
ite in the betting. Vanity Fair, which ac
counted for the Wednesday stake, was
beaten by Aeneas. Vanity Fair was fa
vorite at 2to 1. Narcissus beat Target, at
3 to 5; Kid McCoy beat Peplta, at 1 to 2;

Whitehead, one of tne stars of the Lo
pez kennels, to-day, and must extend
ner.Â«elf to win. E. Geary's Ireland and

San Francisco Cracks Defeat
Oakland Visitors "26 Up"
on Presidio Links.
The first game of the second series of
matcnes between teams representing the
San Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs
was played yesterday afternoon on the
Presidio links and ended in an easy vic
tory for the home team. Not one of the
Oakland eight scored against his oppo
nent, and the winning team came in 26
up. G. D. Greenwood and H. D. Pills
bury played tne closest game,, tying each
other on match play and making exactly
the same number of strokesâ fifty â in
each round. For the winners S. L. Ab
bot Jr. made the best score, beating W.
P., Johnson 6 up. The course and greens
were in pretty good condition, though the
fair green is a good deal j cut up by the
hoofs of artillery horses and tne wheels
of field guns. 11. B. Goodwin of the San
Francisco Golf Club and E. R. Folger of
the Oakland Golf Club opened the match;
both drove short and barely cleared tha
bunker, and both topped their second
shots; after which their play became
steady. In the first nine holes E. R.
Folger beat H. B. Goodwin 1 up, both
players putting somewhat poorly. In the
second round Goodwin gained five holes
on Folger, and thus ended the eighteen
holes 4 up. The score is given by holes
below:
The score as shown by the table was
26 up In favor of the San Francisco team,
and may turn out to be 27. if a protested
hole Is given in L. O. Kellogg'B favor. The
San Francisco Club has a ground rule
that a ball lying on the fair rreen in a
hole so deep that a club placed over it
will not touch it may be dropped without
penalty. I>. O. Kellogg's ball was in such
a hole, but a little outside of the cut
course; he picked it up and. dropping it
behind him. played on without penalty.
On behalf of the Oaklanders it is contend
ed that the rule refers only to a ball on
the fair green and that the. ball in ques
tion was off the course. The protest will
be decided by appeal to the rules commit
tee of the United States Golf Associatiun.
The scores by strokes are shown in the
following table, the first-named player of
each couple being the San Francisco rep
resentative and the second named being a

OUR MISSION TO

Wheeler Talks to the
Ebell.

Oaklasa oace Ban Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway. Jan. 27.
***'"The United States haa a distinct mis
don. It la to prevent the partition of
Cfciiia and help to open up that vast, rich
empire to the world. We can help in
China's assimilation, which means her
evangelization. \y> nave no political m!s

into an empire for trade and the gradual

means our destruction."
These, the closing words of President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler's address before
the Ebell Society this afternoon, brought
to an end one of the strongest ar.d most
Interesting speeches that the new bead of
the State University has yet delivered to
a Pacific Coast audience, and his listeners,
headed by the American history section
of the organization, whose guest Presi
dent Wheeler was, led the enthusiastic
and appreciative applause. The address
was not given a title, but It might have
bÂ«en called a political resume of this
country's history, with reference first to
the Far Kast, then the Mediterranean and
nnally to the England and Russia of to
day. It was thoroughly instructive and
though it might have been delivered to a
colleg-e gathering with more devotedly
educational purposes, was thoroughly en
joyed. President Wheeler said further:
"When J say that America must fear
extension for selfish purposes in the fear
o? her own downfall I want to emphasize
thÂ« fact that she must be faithful to her
fundamental instincts. Responsibility
must ia no case be shifted. It must be

much as any other one thing, implicit
trust in a community as to its own des
tiny and fate. We know from the past
that we can have faith in the people of
thiÂ» country.
"In the past we have been afraid of
o-jr politicians. These politicians have
boon a creat bugaboo. They are not
more. For they do not succeed unless the
spirit of the people is with them. We
have never made politics a very serious

the light of publicity.
Miss Bowen was . walking toward
Lake Merrltt, just east of Oak street,
yesterday, when she saw a runaway
horse coming down the slight descent.
Behind the horse was a phaeton and
in the phaeton was a woman and a
child. They had lost the control of the
horse and were unable to check his
speed.
It was a very dangerous spot. The
Haywards electric oars run here at a
high speed, and the Twelfth-street
mISS DAIST V. BOWEN of
Oakland stopped a runaway
horse yesterday, saved a
woman and a child, and is
now confined to her home with an in
jured foot, caused by the horse step

stop the animal.
Under these circumstances Miss
Bowen has earned the right to be call

WINTER PICNIC WAS
A COMPLETE SUCCESS
ALAMEDA. Jan. 27.â The "Winter Pic
nic," under the auspices of the ladies of
Unity Circle, came to a close this evening.
The affair was' a decided success.
This afternoon luncheon was served by
the ladles. Then followed children's fancy
dancing and a cake-walk. The partici
pants in the cake-walk were Marguerite
Durney. Clifford Barry, Reta Johns, Le

Jenkins and Alfred Durney. In the fancy
dancing Miss Florence Levlne danced the
Tarentella, Eugenic Masten and Herbert
Langhorne the Lovers' Quarrel, Florence
Plummer the Highland Fling and Mar
guerite Durney the skirt dance.
The dancing programme, under the di
rection of George H. Murdock, this even
ing included some old-fashioned dances
and a number of the latest for young
people. The sack race at last night's en
tertainment was won by B. C. Brown and

dam is near. Miss Bowen did not hesi
tate. She saw the danger and deter
mined to stop the horse. Jumping
into the street, she caught the horse
by the bridle and hung on.
The horse carried the young woman
off her feet, and In the struggle
stepped on her foot, crushing it.- But
the girl hung on to the bridle, and in a
few moments .brought the horse to a
standstill.
The excitement kept Miss Bowen up
until she reached her home, and then
she Trent to bed to nurse her injured
foot, and she is still confined to her
bed.
The young heroine positively de
clined to discuss the matter' to-day.
She made light of her injuries, saying
that. they would heal easily, and both
she and her family refused to give the
name of the woman who was rescued
upon the ground that the rescued
woman did not even know that Miss
Bcwen was injured in the affair. The
facts, they said, were true, but as for
details they begged to be excused from
giving them. ' Â¦
WHEELER'S AIM
IS TO ELEVATE
THE STANDARD
None But the Best
Men Wanted.
BERKELEY. Jan. 27.â A prominent
member of the faculty, in speaking to-day
of the policy of the new administration
at the university, said that President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler had outlined a plan ot
action that would set the mlnd3 of tho
taxpayers of the State at rest aa far as
the standard of the university's teaching
force is concerned. It is no secret that
while many men of world-wide repute aro
on the Berkeley faculty there Is too much
material in its composition that ahouM
never have been admitted and retained.
President Wheeler's position on this
point, according to the professor Just
quoted, is simple and unassailable. H*
said flatly before the full faculty that
every promotion made In any department
of the university would be in competition,
with every available man In the country:
that the length of a man's connection
with the institution would not be allowed
to cripple it In the performance of its
duty toward its students. The effect of
such a policy. If carried out as President
Wheeler Is accustomed to do to accom
plish what he sets about, will be radical
and sweeping and will result In time la
establishing ajt the university a teaching
force second to none.
President Wheeler was out of town to
day and so could not be seen with regard
to the report, but Its source Is unquestion
ably reliable.
BEARS A DYING
MESSAGE FOR A
SOLDIER'S LOVE
Romantic Tale by an
Oakland Boy.
Oakland Office San Frar.cl?co Call.
DOS Broadway. Jan. 27.
With a soldier's dying message to a
sweetheart whom he had sought in vain.
Ben Harbor, an Oakland boy, has re
turned to this city from Manila. I: Is a
message of love that Harbor carries,
whispered in his ear by a wounded ami
dying comrade as they were being carried
from the battlefield, and she for whom
the message was intended cannot be
found. â¢ It is known, however, that she
has entered a convent, and an appeai will
be made to the Catholic authorities to as
sist in locating her.
Harbor's story sounds like a romance Â«f
the olden time. "When the war broke out
he enlisted In the Fourteenth Infantry,
and one of his messmates in the Philip
pines was Guy Rodan. a Kansas boy. who
had left home, friends and sweetheart to
fight for his country. The men became
friends, and on Sunday morning. Febru
ary 5. when the insurgents engaged In
their first fight with the American troops,
they went -into the battle side by side.
A strategic point was blockhouse ' No. 14,
in which there were a number of Filipi
nos, and Company I. Fourteenth Infantry,
under Lieutenant Miles, was sent to
charge it. Both Harbor and Sodan were
members of the company, and both be
came victims of Mauser bullets. They lay
for a time on the battlefield, and finally
they were placed In an ambulance by the
Red Cross men to be conveyed to the hos
pital.
On the Journey to the hospital Soiian
told his friend that he had been shot
through by a Mauser and that he must
surely die. Harbor tried to cheer him.
although he, too, had been shot through
the hip.
"It is no use," said Sodan, feebly, "I
have been shot to death, and I want you
to take a message to my sweetheart, for
I feel that you will live. My sweetheert
is not like other girls. She loves me, and
she will never love any one else. Aly
death will break her heart."
"Hearts of women are not so easily
broken." said Harbor, in another effort
to cheer him. Â¦-:, :.. Â¦--.
Then, as Sodan became exhausted. Har
bor bent his head and listened to the fare
well message of the dying man. It was a
message to Miss Mabel Lowry, to whom
Sodan had been engaged in Kansas, bfre
had a few weeks before written to hvr
lover that she would Join him In the Phil
ippines, and Sodan was expecting her to
arrive within a few days.
That night the brave Kansan died, ard
for eleven months Harbor lay between life
and death In the hospital at- Manila. When
he was able he was sent back to SÂ«tn
Francisco, and he then commenced his
search for Miss Lowry- In course of tirse
he learned that she had come to Califor
nia, expecting to take passage for the
Philippines, but upon reaching San Fran
cisco she learned through the newspapers
that her lover was dead. At first she
gave up in despair, but at last decided to
give her life to uplifting and helping oth
ers. She therefore took the veil and has
since been buried In one of the convents
about the bay. So far young Harbor's
efforts to find her have not succeeded, but
he hopes to obtain the assistance cf the
Mothers Superior of the various convents.

INJURY RECEIVED
AT BASKET-BALL
Miss Myrtle Montrose
May Not Live.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 27.
"Word has come from Nevada that Mis?
Myrtle Montrose, a member of the Ne
vada basket-ball team, may die as the re
sult of Injuries received while playing bas
ket-ball against the young ladies oC the
University of California. Her condition
Is very serious and demands a third oper
ation, which it is feared the young lady
cannot "survive. This Is the first case of
serious Injury resulting from basket-ball
playing, though there have been many
cases of injury In the masculine equiva
lent, football.
Miss Myrtle Montrose was the leading
member of the Nevada basket-ball team,
and she took a very prominent part In
the game that was played last year be
tween the young ladies of the blue and
gold and the young ladies of the Sage
brush State.
.During the .Interstate game Miss Mon
trose was thrown against a post, and It
was thought that only the bridge, of her
nose had been broken and that the In
jury, while painful, was not serious. The
injury was treated and she returned to
Nevada.
Since that time she has been compelled
to submit to two operations, and a third
is now necessary. The injury has proven
very much more severe tha.n was at first
thought. The bone of the front of thÂ»
skull was fractured in many directions,
and some of the splinters were forced in
ward upon the brain. This might hp.ve
been relieved had the Injury been upon
the top of the head, but being on the
front the danger of operating was very
great.
The Information from Nevada says that
the young lady cannot survive a third op
eration, and that-a third operation will be
absolutely necessary.

tion in San Salvador which would again place him In control. He had not
been In the City of Mexico long, however, before the Minister from San
Salvador, Rafael Zaldivar, heard ol his intentions, and with the aid of
President Diaz of Mexico Induced Ezeta to reconsider his plans, promising
him that the Government of San Salvador would refund all the- confiscated
estate.
Last Wednesday word was received here that Ezeta. had left the City of
Mexico for Oakland. As he had been waiting for several weeks for word
from the San Salvador Government In reference to his demand that his fam
ily property be restored, It Is believed that he has received a definite and
satisfactory reply. The confiscated estate belonging to both Ezeta and his
wife Is valued at several millions of dollars. When he started his revolu
tion some years ago Ezeta was defeated and forced out of the country and
his property seized. The ex-President has quietly run a little bluff on the
Salvadorean Government. He threatened another revolution" and the Gov
ernment purchased peace at the price of returning his property.
The ex-President has been living In Oakland for some years, and this re
covery of his property will be of great interest to many of his friends
here.An Englishman has designed a convertl
ble dining and billiard table, which has
the cushions secured to wooden rails,
which are hinged to the edges of the table
to swing underneath when not In use,
clamps being provided at the ends to lock
the rails In a lowered or raised position.

weird and mysterious services were held,
during which the Associated Student Body
of the San Francisco State Normal School
initiated the class of December, 01. After

Joyed by all, alter which the "Jolly
twelve" walked for a cake, and the honor
was carried off .by Miss Mate Moore. The
new and old members then danced with
much merriment the Virginia reel.
Much of the success of the afternoon is
due to Miss Imogene Stein, president, as
sisted by Misses Anita Sullivan, Eva

The following were initiated: Misses
Marie Rechter. Mabel Neff. Minnie Cozad,

ANCIENT JAPANESE ART.
Valuable and Unique Bronze Vessel
Now on Exhibition.
Among the number of Interesting and
valuable bronzes now on exhibition in the
San Francisco Art Association gallery is
one that Is of peculiar Interest, not alone
on account of- its richness in quality but
also because it Is an actual model of the
type of vessel In use by the Japanese in
the sixteenth and the early part of the
seventeenth century.' The model Itself
was manufactured at some time between
the years IGOS and 1630 for the reigning
Shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, as it
bears the crest of that family, the oldest
known crest of Japan. It was during this
period that Japanese art was at its high
est degree of excellence, and this speci
men will at once attract the interest of
connoisseurs, owing to the quality of the
bronze and the richness of its design.
The ships in use at that time among the
Japanese were far less seaworthy than
those of European nations. The name In
scribed on the vessel is Hoho Maru, which
no doubt was the name of the Imperial
vessel of which it is the model. It was
designed for and used as an incense
burner.
It came Into possession of Frederic S.
Samuels, the present owner, about twenty
years ago, having been sent to him from
Kioto, Japan, the home of the Tokugawa
family during its reign as regents or the
empire.

(OVER THE EMPORIUM.)
TO PROTECT THE CITY.
North Central Improvement Associa-
tion Requests a Guarantee From
Pacific Surety Company.
The North Central Association has re
quested the Pacific Surety Company to
guarantee the city against any claim on
the part of the contractors for the Hall
of Justice that the building had been ac
cepted in case it should be occupied before
It has been -fully completed. In the com
munication Is the following:
"We have been endeavoring to secure
the occupancy of the Hall of Justice, hav
ing filed petitions in that regard with the
Board . of Supervisors and the Board of
Public Works. We learn from you that
the patent locking device for the Jiill
called for by the specifications of the con
tract cannot be placed for at least two
months. In the meantime the hall is prac
tically ready for occupancy, but the ques
tion would arise whether it would not
complicate matters for the city to take
possession of any portion of the building
until the building Is entirely completed
in all Its details and finally accepted by
the city. It might be held as a legal ac
ceptance of the building if partial occu
pancy occurred. We desire to ask you
whether you would guarantee the city
against any such claim being made by
the contractors, or any other party, that
partial occupancy would In any way be
held to be a legal acceptance of the build
ing. With such a guarantee we think
that the city could safely begin to occupy
the building, so that by the time the lock
ing device Is placed the occupation would
be complete/

EXPENSE OF LIVING IN PABIS.
"To prove that we axÂ© economical
young women shall I tell you how much
we pay at the pension?" writes a girl in
the Ladles* Home Journal, who, with a
girl companion, is ! traveling in Franca
and giving the- benefit of her experience
to girls who may go to- the Paris Exposi-
tion next year.
"The tariff card tacked on the wall of
my rose-twined Marie Antoinette room
says the price is 9 francs. Then, now do
I come to be paying only 7? One learns
over here to marchanderâ 'to haggle, to
bargain.' If madam's prices read 'from
7 francs.' and you write to her asking If
she can let you have a room and at that
price, she will probably reply that thÂ©
only rooms she has unrented cost 10
francs. But if you are wlsr enough to
ask her if she has a room ; for 7 francs
the answer will be "ye*-'
"We are. of course, beyond the pale of
the bathtub, electric lights and big tips:
the maid who cares for our room Ts sat-
isfied to receive a modest fee, and it is
with a thrill of delight that we pick up
our candlesticks and say â¢good-night.*
Just as they do in novels, we are com-
fortable and happy on J2 per day. The
fact that we are alone does not bring
us a- moment's annoyance, nor subject us
to. any unreasonable restraints."

UNBOUNDED SUCCESS IS THAT HE AD-
VERTISES NOTHING BUT WHAT HE CAN
DO.' â¢
He will not consent to have his ability meas-
ured by any other standard than his own. for

the separated and causes a speedy and happy
marriage with the one of your choice, locates
mines. Interprets dreams, tells of your friends
and enemies, removes evil Influences, gives ad-
vice pertaining to lawsuits, etc.
There is no home so dreary and sad, no life so
wrecked or blighted, no heart co sad and lonely,
no condition or circumstances so complicated or
Incomprehensible that cannot be set right and
kept right after a visit to this Inspired prophet
of modern times. Call and be convinced of his
su:>erlor power.
Is your, husband or wife untrue? Has the
demon rum assailed the happy quietude of your
home? Does another share the love and atten-
tion that should belong to you? If so, come
and learn a swift and sure remedy that will
dispel the dark clouds and lift the load from
your aching heart. Those that are unsuccessful
are made prosperous and started on the road
to wealth. If you have been deceived by the
false predictions of others do not despair, . but
call and be convinced of the above statement.

NEW YORK. Jan. 27.â ThÂ« rfv-Jt market
v.kb narrow and professional to-day, but re
flected some slightly Increased lnfrefct. and
trices showed some response to new* develop
ments. Quite an active speculation developed
in Third avenue, which was feverish at a level
extending to 6v. points below lest nifrht. Ru- I
Dora were rife touching the plans for financing
the floating debt of this eotEfNtay; and denials
followed quickly on rumorf. The market was
disposed to resist this influence and hardened,
tlie gpecialtiee leading in point of activity and
Ftrensth. The rather cheerful tone of the
â¢reekly trade reviews, the good - railroad earn
ings for the third ueei In January and the
expectation of a strong bank statement pro
noted baying. The December statement of Ht.
Psul chocked the movement on account of tlie
<3ecreaÂ»e of JIW'.OOO in net earnings for the
w>nth fey reason of Increased operating ex
penses. The decrease in net earnings ot the

to SSoV>'- > . The totai was offered down a I

There was but an indifferent rally on the
bank statement, and prices were ellKhtly lower
thai, yesterday et the close. The j.roportions
of the 1.-.an Increase agÂ£in proved a sharp rise,
though the loan cxi>anMon w&s only a fraction
of the increased cn-dit facilities aflorded by the
cash Increase. There has been no borrowing
(Jf-nuuid manlfevt on the Stock Kxchansc dur- I
IBS the week, and thÂ«- time loan and rnercaij- |
tile pajxr r.iarkt-ts have been reported dull, al
though banker* have been offering additional
ina'4r*mcnts to place loans. No operations
have been known of sufficient eire to account
Jor the loan expansion of t7.6U.70A.
A BXnSLU contingent of rrofeEt-tona! operators
In Etocks and foreign arbilrase brokers have
<3one practically all of the trading on the Stock
ICxchanse for the past week. 7>ealings have
not exceeded in volume thos* of â¢ last week,
and bonds have shown a j-rosresslve decrease.
There were rather wide changes In prices on
several cays, but they v/r-re but vibrations
uue to professional manipulation, and the
tloslwg of eOB&BCtt served to draw j>ric(s back
to hint Saturday's level, around v.'hich the
market oscillated. The reckon* for the ex
cessjve â¢;.,.:â¢â¢.-- are not entirely clear, as many
conditions conform to those in tormer periods
of great h-pÂ»rulÂ»Mve activity, notably the large
reflux at money to the reserva centers from
active upe in business and uniformly fuvcrabie
rejiorts of business and trade.
There is st lfcrc-> body in Wall street of the
ojn.iion that the dullness is only explicable en
the score of the eusnentje over the outcome of
the war in gouth Africa. Uut there were two
events there durins the week which were
thought of sufficient importance In the London
stock market to induce considerable specula
tive activity tb<Â»r<? without awakening any In
terest in the Neur yo r k market outside th<Â«
foreign arbitrage cff.ces and the professional
trader*. Prices of internationally listed stocks
responded t-harply, ac the narrow market made
the arbitrage operations erfectlve in keeping
prices near the London parity. This !s not
conclusive evidence, though it is against the
essumptlon of the dominating Influence of the
Couth African war upon speculative sentiment.
The taking of Spion Kop was not to be ex
pected to mark the final submission of the
i4v--is any mere than the retaking was to be
Interpreted as the rellnuuiEhment of the Brit
ish camiiaign, yet both were deumeU imi>ortant
developments and had reflection as such In the
London btovk market without inducing any
afvpreeiablo buying of stucks here in the one
cax or selling in the other. It is safe to con
clude trv,m this that the world's commerce and
finance have bo far adjusted themselves to the
interruption of the Transvaal gold supply from
flowinK into the world's slock as not to be
severely shaken by the events threatening a
prolongation of the interruption. What would
be the effect en speculative markets of a sud
den development promising early termination
of the war and resumption of the Transvaal j
gold output is another question. It Is a fact 1
that B-jine competent authorities on the money
market in Wall street are not free from ay- ,
prehension over the money outlook, notwith
standmt the present ease of money in nearly
all departments. The first part of the month
brought heavy disbursements trom the Treas
ury on account of pension payments, which j
kei't down the surplus, but current returns j
from the Treasury show a day to day surplus 1
owing to heavy revenue collections. The de
posits of internal revenue collections in Na
tional bank depositories are also approaching
the limits provided for by the Government
bonds deposited with the Treasury by the banks
as security, after which the taking up of the
surplus by the Treasury would be resumed. In
the case of thÂ« London money market the Bank
of England, having helped to tide over the an
nual settlement perior with liberal loans. Is
now recuff-ratlng its reserves and receiving
large payments- of lc-ans. Although the bank
rate has' boen reduced from 6 to 4 per cent
.since the first of the year, it Is still nearly 1
per cent above the private discount rate and
thus entourages continued paying of loans.
The future of the London market depends
much upon whether the BanK of England's
policy of recuperation is in preparation for
Government lnan issues to provide for war
expenses, an event which would probably draw
gold from New York. Added to these con
siderations is some feeling of doubt and Ques
tioning aroused by the very free discussion and
criticism of a New York trust company. These
accounts, while ct Importance in themselves.
are of even greater importance in the principles
ln\'olved in the placing of loans owing to the
promotion of industrial ccri-orations. The ar
gument that prices ot securities are at an in
viting level must b<? considered in connection
with the fact that van amount* of money were
sn*-nt at the extreme high prices last year,
comi-ared with which present prices represent
heavy losses and discouragement or in
ability to buy. Thrse positive factors toward
dullness are In addition to the negative or I
passive one of waitinc for the industrial fu- ;
ture to define itself more accurately.
The falling off in the rate of Inflow of money ,
seeking employment has served to decrease the |
demand for bonds and has resulted In price <
reactions in suniÂ« points. The market has con- : !

NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The Financier says:
Tha New York Clearing-house banks added
$5,002. fi00 to their surplus reserve last week.
making the present excels $29,277,975. the largest
reported since the middle of June, 1839. At the
former period loans and deposits were at about
their rraximum. while the cash holdings were
$30,000,000 In excess of present supplies. The
banks were then faring the yearly demand for
crop purposes, which depleted the reserves to
the vanishing point over the fall season. Now,
with *very prospect of continued gains from
the interior, the problem concerns the disposi
tion of this excess cash, rather than the con
traction of loan 3 to meet the heavy call for
money elsewhere. It is a fact, however, that
the business of the banks is Increasing faster
than general conditions seem to warrant. The
Â«-xpa.nsion of $7,515,600 in loans during the past
week, in the face of an extremely active stock
market, is not easily explained, especially since
it follows a gain of $4,500,000 the previous week".
The loan Item Is therefore over $12,000,000
higher than it was two weeks ago. while Stock
Exchange business in that time has been ex
tremely dull. How far special causes have
troiiKht this about cannot be stated, but it is
to be said that the gain has been distributed
over a larce number of institutions and is not
confined, as with cash gains, etc., to a few
of the larger banks. With reference to the
latter the detailed statement fhows that one
bank eained over two-thirds of the cash last
week, while Its loans remained practically sta
tionary. In other words, the reserve of this
institution gained at the expense of other mem
bers of the Clearing-house. The Increase of
$15,000,000 in deposits reported by all the banks
is about what the operations of the week callt-d
for. and since the banks are required to carry
an additional reserve of $3,750.00) on the extra
deposits the gain in reserve is smaller than In
dicated by the receipts of cash. The influx
of currency shows no signs of falling off, but
It Is Interesting to recall that exactly one year
aro the reserves of the banks touched their
maximum for the earlier part of the year and
from that time on. while money continued to
pour into New York in large volume the ex
pansion In business was suoh as to outstrip
thece accessions, with the result that the sur
plus reserve had fallen to $15,000,000 at the be
ginning of April. The boom In the stock mar
ket which brought about this shrinkage Is now
entirely lacking and gives no immediate sign
of beinc at hand.

Beans and Seeds.
According to the reports of dealers, seldom
has the Bean market been in such good shape as
at present.. The crop in Europe is so light that
exports to the United States are out of the
question. In addition the crops throughout the
East are slender, and the Eastern and Southern
States are obliged to look to California for sup
plies. In this State, to make matters worse (or
better), the stock Is said to be smaller than for
five years. Under these circumstances the
market is very firm and steadily, though slowly,
tending upward. The only advance yesterday
was In large White.

1.!NATIONAL PURE FOODS LAW.
Western Manufacturers Stand for the
Senate Bill.
Dr. "William H. Frear, chairman of the
executive committee of the National Pure
Food Congress, in a recent letter to the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion states that Hon. M. Broslus of Penn
sylvania has Introduced in the House of
Representatives a pure food bill, which
will be recommended, so he has been in
formally advised, by the Senate Commit
tee on Manufactures, which during the
past summer conducted investigations
throughout the East relative to the adul
teration of food products. The resolution
has provoked no little comment in va
rious parts of the United States and some
opposition by those who have found It
profitable to adulterate food products for
the export and domestic trades. Indus
trial bodies and manufacturers of legiti
mate goods, however, have declared in
favor of the bill, ana none have come
more earnestly to the front than the peo
ple of this State, especially as the meas
ure effects the wine, olive oil, fruit and
other product interests of the State.
The bill Is very broad and fax reaching,
being "for preventing the adulteration,
misbranding and imitation of foods, bev
erages, etc." in the United States and
Territories. At a meeting of the direc
tors of the Manufacturers' and Produc
ers' Association a resolution was adopted
"that the California delegation in Con
gress be respectfully urged to give their
support to the Brosius bill, which we un
derstand .will be advocated by the Sen
ate Committee on Manufactures as a re
sult of its recent Investigations of thÂ«>
subject of food adulterations, and that
copies of this resolution be forwarded to
the State delegation in Congress."

the day before his death drew $370 from

money for bond coupons. No deposit had

inferred that the dead man's room had

the Spreckels Company interest here, as
well as inspecting large interests at King

shut down for two weeks on account of
the supply of beets being discontinued,

EARLY ACTION ON
THE CANAL BILL
?
It Will Come Up During
This Week.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan. 27.â
Representative Hepburn, chairman of the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce of the Hoube of Representa
tives, is at work on his report on the
Nicaraguan canal bill and expects to get
it before the House some time during the
ensuing week. He has not yet arranged
for the time for taking it up for debate,
but he intends to ask (he House to con
sider It some time during the month of
February. It is not believed there will be
any trouble in having the time assigned
for consideration of the bill, as Speaker
Henderson and all the members of the
House Committee on Rules of both parties
axe in favor of it.
Several other important matters are
aheart of the Nicaraguan canal bill on the
programme of the Senate leaders, and it
is probable that the measure will pass
the House first. In that event it will be
considered in the Senate instead of the
Senate bill which has been reported.
Considerable interest is taken in official
circles in the sentiment existing in Eng
land as voiced by the London Spectator
favoring the abrogation by the British
Government of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
wi;hout waiting for the United States to
request such action It was again reiter
ated to-day that no negotiations or dis
cussion of the advisability of abrogating
the treaty had recently occurred between
the two Governments. As has been stated,
there is no disposition in official circles to
press the British Government at this time
upon any questions, but if Congress
should pass the canal bill then the Presi
dent probably would feel justified in call
ing the treaty to the attention of Lord
Salisbury, if in the meantime that official
has not made any representations to the
{secretary of State relative to this abro
gation.
The two Governments thoroughly under
stand one another's attitude in this mat
ter. The United States is desirous of se
curing the abrogation of the treaty. Great
Britain is willing to comply with its de-
Eire, provided concessions in the Alaska
boundary dispute are made. But it may
be that. In view of the South African war
and the deeire of Great Britain to pre
serve the friendship of the United States,
she may deem it proper, when negotia
tions are opened, to abrogate the treaty
as an evidence of her willingness to meet
the views of this Government and to con
tinue cordial relations.

â¢
LONDON. Jan. 27.â Some of the after
noon papers associate the departure to
day of the new Japanese battleship Shik
lshima with possible complications in re
gard to the situation in China, especially
us it Is announced that the Shikishima
win endeavor to traverse the Suez canal
by divesting herself of her armament.
"Up to the present no 6hJp of euch size

The interpretation that the departure of
the Shiklshima was airectly due to the
eltuatloii In China is incorrect, as the As
sociated Press learns to-day that the date
jÂ»et for the sailing vra*> decided on many
Â¦weeks ago end a farewell party was held
on board of her previous to the deposition
of the Emperor of China. But though this
Incident was given exaggerated import
ance In the afternoon papers the Asso
ciated Press is able to say that those in
England most cognizant of the secret
alms of Japan, especially those who are
fulrilllr^ her naval contracts, have for
tome time pact thoroughly believed she
meditated striking a blow at Russia. If
this Impression is correct, and there la
the highest and most conservative author
ity on which to base It. it is not unlikely
that Japan's hand may be forced and that
her intended coup will be attempted be-
Xore her plans are completed.
It may be that Japan only intends for
the present to prevent Russia acomplish-
Jng the designs which various correspond
ents have credited her with since the
change in China's Emperor.
Two powerful war vessels built for
Japan on the Clyde will soon be ready to
sail, while others are under course of
rapid construction. Their strength has
not attracted much attention, but their
importance as international factors can
be judged from a statement made by one
of England's greatest ship builders, who
declared that the vessels building for
Japan wore the mr^t powerful in the
Â¦world and could destroy the best British
ships in ftftiÂ°*Â»n minutes.
Several of Japan's vessels in course of
construction would have been completed
before now had not Japan encountered
financial difficulties. The British builders
would not let the vessels sail until every
thing wils paid for In cash. To accom
plish this Japan Induced a syndicate of
English bankers to advance the money,
and their action has been the subject of
a. good deal <>i private criticism in the in
ner Admiralty circles when it was realized
Â¦what a tremendous naval power Japan
was accumulating. Though Great Brlt
i :: - strength was not impaired, it was
thought inadvisable for British capitalists
to po materially assist Japan to become a
dangerous rival.
A well-known naval expert says that if
Japan puts into commission the ships
prheduled for wan lee in the near future
t=he will be ready for war within six
months and can then defy Russia, and as
the Japanese and Russian ships at pres
ent in the Far East compare Japan's fleet
would have an excellent chance of con
trolling tr#Â» situation.
