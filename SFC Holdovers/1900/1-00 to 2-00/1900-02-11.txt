SUNDAY CALL
FEBRUARY 11 .1900.
ilutions have taken the sting out of the
memory of this affair. Zaldivar met
Ezeta in Mexico and for one reason or an
other lent a favorable ear to Ezeta's
pleading. Ezeta Is an exile and therefor*
cannot return to that country. Rut
upon the advice of Senor Zalvidar Mrs.
Ezeta will go down there to personally
plead their cause. \- .
It was while General Carlos Ezeta was
an -exile In Guatemala that he met his
wife. She was the most beautiful girl In
the capital and General Ezeta immedi
ately laid siege to that most dangerous
citadelâ a woman's' heart. The Zaldivar
affair. In which Ezeta had played rather
a questionable part, according to foreign
standards, only lent an additional.inter
est-to'the dashing soldier.' In Central
America all Is fair, ln revolution/ And peo-,
pie considered that General Ezeta had '
acted wisely and well in preferring exila"
to enforced .suicide. â¢Â¦'r'.. ''â¢
So Don Carlos whiled away the hours of
his exile fingering a guitar under the win
dow of the loveliest girl in all Guatemala.
When a pair, of brilliant .black eyes had
paid "si." Don, Carlos called .upon Â£ the
family and In the regulation way asked
for the daughter's hand. She belonged to
one- of the wealthiest and. most aristo
cratic families In Guatemala, but -Don
Carlos de Ezeta was declared a suitable
husband and the wedding -was straight
way solemnized.
For, a while General Ezeta -was content.
Then the inactivity of exile began, to pall
on him. Nothing but. a revolution would
cure his ennui. A revolution he must
have. With his brother, Antonio Ezeta,
he laid his plans, and when the time was
ripe they met the soldiers of President
Menendcz. At nightfull tho Ezeta flag
fluttered over the field and In the morn
ing Carlos Ezeta was dictator of Salva
dor, pending a farcical election that would
make him President. Ills brother, An-
raent that Ezeta had gone to Mexico and
following on the heels of his departure
came the news that ho had succeeded In
effecting a compromise with Salvador. If
the plans of Zalvidar and his one-time
enemy, Ezeta, do not go awry the Ezetas
will be able to live In lavender for the rest
of their lives.
It is a strange story this of the Central
American revolutions and one that could
not elsewhere have Its setting. It Is a
lutlons that arf always ready to fame ont
down there, but I hc?e nut. I think it will
be all risht. Heaven knc-v.s rr.y poor wifa
has suffered enough in our unsettled
"Santa Maria! If people only knew
how slad I am that there is a chance for
me to lartoji? thinking "revolution." Some
th!r.k I like it. I don't. I've had too much
of the ups and (Ijt.t.s of th* real thing to
ever again enjoy bei.ig a revolutionist."
LATEST EFFORT OF DON CARLOS EZETA, REVOLUTIONIST
tonlo, was put In command of the army.
/ For a while the Ezeta popularity ran
(high. 'Carlos and Antonio Ezeta made
.friends on all sides.- Mrs. Eseta presided
in the executive mansion with rare tact
and charm. Rut gradually the inevitable
storm that : must break over their Presi
dent's head began to gather. At first there
were only low ..mutterlngs. . . r ....:;-
"Change ; the President, change the
j times," grumbled the people. "The poor
tare getting poorer, the Ezetas are get
ting richer," whispered the mischief-mak
iers. "1113 time is up; why doesn't he
j pet out?" said one' man, and. then the
| storm clouds burst. This man. ' Senor
i Gutierrez, at ' the head of a rldlcuously
i email force, made ' ready to Â¦ defeat tho
Ezetas. But tho gods of war favored him
and Gutlerres triumphed.'
Â¦The : Ezetas; were once more forced to
j flee from their native land. Carlos Ezeta
1 put his wife and family on board a' ship
| and- quietly. steamed out of Salvador for
[Panama. : Thence they went to New York
and then on to Paris' for. a half-year,,
finally coming to California. They were
supposed to have quit the country with
a wealth in foreign bonds Â«.nd. securities,
(but "later events 'have shown that .they
escaped with very , little.
(..Until the death of. Antonio Ezeta, revo
lutions I were monthly promises from Â¦ the
'Ezetas. Â¦* They probably did i spend their
days and nights planning to reinstate
ithemselves, but the means were lacking.
.After Antonio's death," it 5 was' believed
that Carlos had given up^all hope of ever
.pulling a plum out of "the political pie in
'Salvador. He had burned his fingers so
[often doing it, and the plums after all did
'.not prove Juicy.
Then of a sudden came the announce-
The Man Who J^ Recognized as.
Great Cnt^f Of Salvador
IHAVE had enough of revolutions.
Sant.a Maria! what have they done
for us: ! could hayÂ«- be<n a flaquero
and lived happily on the coffee plan
tation with my wife and children.
Instead â oh, Dlos Babe!" anfl Don Carlos
Ezeta rolled a frejh cigarette. "You
*=cc that one red rose out there?" raid
Don Carlos, "you think you could make
it Into a cherry tree? No more you cou'.d
bare made me anything but a fighterâ
a revolutionist. Hut now 1 would be con
tent to live a happy, peaceful life away
from that country of revolutions.
"Does it pay to be a revolutionist, you
BÂ«=k m"? If it pays to be President of
that country, si. for it is all the Fame
thinpâ to be President you must be a
revolutionist. You think it worth while?
.Walt, I chow you. We live here In this
home, very nioe, very comfortable^ one
cor.k, one nurse for the bebitos. Now
even to keep this 1 must nsk my country
to give me back something of what I
Jiav? lost. For this 1 have been a Presi
dent and a revolutionist!
"Oh. sf. I think they will give me some
thing. 1 hav<Â» every hope. If justice !s
Â«3one we wi!l surely pot it. Would I have
started a revolution if they had not
promised? Quien sabe?" and Don Carlos
freeing questions ahead that he did not
care to answer hastily excused himself
for a moment. But other lips answered
them during his absence.
The last of the Ezeta revolutions was
planned not many moons ago. Don
Carlos de Ezeta left suddenly for
Mexico, and in print -and out it was
Ftated that he went there to obtain the
Â¦wherewithal to kindle a revolution in
Falvador. Ezeta has influential relatives
In Mexico, ar.d moreover there is a warm
personal friendship existing between Don
Carlos and President Diaz.
The rumors of revolution floated Salva
dorwarfl as fust as the waves could car
ry them. President Regalados of Salva
dor sent a Minister Plenipotentiary to
Mexico to confer with Ezeta and to re
port to the Salvador Government. The
result of this conference was that a, few
lh* end of his four-year term. In that
country a revolution places a President
In office, and only a revolution can put 'a
President out of office.
Zaldivar discovered the plot against
him and learned, to his surprise, that the
leader was Carlos Ezeta. the. man to
whom he had given the command of the
army. Zaldivar wasted no time in. has
tening to Santa Ana. where Ezeta waa
stationed. The two men met alone In a
barracks room. Outside the guards stum
hlfii sleepily, not knowing or caring that
the Ft range midnight visitor was "el Pres-
Idente." Roth men were outwardly calm.
Zaldivar laid the proofs of Ezeta's guilt
nn the table beside him. "It is a time to
net. not to discuss." he said, and pulling
nut his pistol he placed it next to the in
rrlmirtating papers. "I am unarmed, your
Excellency," answered Ereta. "We are
not going to fight a duel," said Zaldivar.
â¢â¢I leave my pistol for youâ lt has put m
md to hotter men."
At the tloor Zaldivar turned, and looked
nt Ezeta blankly staring at the pistol In
his hand. "You are a traitor, you have
a pistol, you know what to do. I promUa
you a military funeral." and Zaldivar
stalked into the night.
Rut Carlos Ezeta did not fancy aulcM*.
though assured of a military funeral. He
escaped and with the aid of frier.ds mnd<Â»
h!s way into Guatemala. Lessor leaders
of the revolution carried on th* wr>'k,
Zaldivar was defeated and MenenduS
took the Presidency.
All this was years ngo. and tho for
tunes and misfortunes of. succeeding rwro-
The Hottest Place in the World.
What is believed to he the hottest re
ffion In the world Is that part of ihe east
ern shore of the Persian gulf which is
named after the Rahrein islands that lie
near lt. On the Rahrein Island proper,
which is the largest of the group, the
thermometer never fails below 100 degrees
day or night, and often rises as high as.
140 degrees in the shade. Only the native*
can bear this enormous heat at nil. and
even they suffer terribly at times because
the. fierceness of the temperature variea
so little and gives them hardly a respite.
To add to the decided discomforts of the
region the coast is so dry that borings
have been made as deep as 1000 feet with
out striking water. There is not a, drop
to be had except far In the Interior, and
the. condition of water carried for any
distance ; In such heat as thl3 may be
Imagined. Yet the natives never lack for
water that is not merely fresh, but ac
tually cool. And they get lt In a way
that is wonderful. They get it by diving
into the sea for it.
Many years ago pearl fishers who dived
into the waters off the shores of these
isiands for pearls, which are plentiful
there, .discovered that immense springs
Bpouted from the bottom of the sea. Ac
cidentally they round that thesje springs
were of sweet water. . Ever since then a
regular industry, perhaps Â¦ onq of the
strangest industries in the world, has been
thnt of divinrr for Irc^li water.'
The divers so out every morning. They
cake w.it!i th*m goaMU&S: and. weighted
with stones tv iitsure a swift descent they
plunge into the depth?. At the bottom
they hold the irouths of the skins over a
â¢PTffiff, ana as soon asit is tilled tin lt
up swiftly and ascend. The skins ~arÂ«
hauled up with lines.
As there are p.CGO persons In -that bar
ren crroup of islands the industry of div
ing for fresh water is a large one and thm
divers get rich The water "la about twen
ty degrees cooler than is the atmosohere
on land so it is a boon to the sufl>VtiÂ£
population; and the lucky divers who g~t

In fact, the fresher the water is the mor,

I.? i< â¢i tem P e rature before lt Is lanrt
ed-i* one can say that water Is "landed,"
days ago Ezeta came quietly back to his
home in Fruitvale. Mr. Ezeta says he
has every hope that the government will
return to him some of his lost Salvador
possessions. ,
So the result of this revolution, fought
on pen and paper, still hangs in air. In a
month Mrs. Ez<?ta Itaves for Salvador to
act for her husband. In the* matter. If
they receive the money whicn they con
fidently expect, tills last and bloodless
Ezeta revolution will be the most suc
cessful of the many which Ezeta . has
managed. ââ¢;Â¦/
And, strange to say, in this latest Ezeta
revolution, which was fought with pcn3
Instead of puns, the , leading characters
were the same that .many years : ago
fought on opposite sides in Â¦ the struggle
that first Introduced Carlos Ezeta to the
world as a revolutionist. fc .
When Rcgalados, who. is now President
cf Salvador, heard that Kzcta- was plan
ning a revolution he determined to ward
It off If possible. President Regalados has
not yet had time to thirst "for a new rev
olution. About a year ago hÂ« became
President after the prevailing fashion in
his country, which saves the people the
trouble of casting a. vote. â¢ - .
As the leader of the rebel army Regala
dos defeated the Government forces,
ousted President Gutierrez and took the
reins of government In hJs own hands.
With this still fresh In his memory. Reen
lados Is not looking for further trouble.
Therefore he sent one Senor Zaldlv3r,
with the powers, of Minister Plenipoten
tiary, to confer with Ezeta in the City'of
Mexico.
Truly fate plays strange pranks. On the
report of Senor Zaldivar depends the.fato
ci Carlos Ezeta. Yet years ago, through
the plotting: of Carlos Ezeta, Zaldivar
lost the Presidency of Salvador. Ezeta
was commander of the army under Pr*Â»F

2turned name. He is called Rhym
ing Bob in the tramp fraternity.
"Rhyming Bob" is probably the
best-known tramp on this or the
other side of the Rockies.
His brother tramps regard him
with some respect and much awe.
In the first place though he does not
break the sacred rules of the order
by working for a living yet the
"cops" have never run him in as a
"vag." The awe which is the chief
ingredient in their respect is due to
his powers as a rhymsicr. Shakes
peare is not even a navie to them â
"Rhyming Bob" is the only poet in
the business, according to the liter
ary critics in tramphood.
Like Homer of old Rhyming Bob
travels from city to city begging his
bread as he goes and singing his
lays. But 'tis unlikely that even
one city will claim Rhyming Bob
dead, for his songs in nowise re
semble Homer's. Rhyming Bob
says he must write down to the poor
taste of his hearers; that his best
efforts are too much for their mean
and unpoetical understandings.
Even his poorest efforts, however,
are said to contain most marvelous
flights of fancy, and indicate that
he is not on speaking terms with
words of one syllable.
However complicated his "ante
cedents'* may be, he declares and
gives evidence of having once lived
with cultured people surrounded
by the luxuries of wealth. Robert
Jones, better known as "Rhyming
Bob," says he passed his entrance
examination for Harvard when
very xoung and after graduating
wrote for sczrral of the leading
magazines. But he gave up every
thing twenty years ago to join the
wandering brotherhood of tramps.
Why? Rhyming Bob refuses to
answer* '
" RBYMING BOB," QUEEREST OF TRAMPS
THE SUNDAY CALL.
sf TRAMP is a tramp the
uTJ. green earth over, the seven
seas around. A tramp with
a college education and an aptitude
for turning rhymes is a tramp
cccentriquc, as the bill boards would
put it. Such a one is Robert Jones,
who occupies a unique position in
the fraternity of Weary Willies.
Despite "that tired feeling"
which is chronic with a true tramp,
the dusty brctlwen travel the coun
try over from cud to end, covering
the distance in freight cars, by
friendly lifts from drivers, or, last
method of all â on foot. By means
cf ilie first two, which are consid
ered honorable in tramp-locomotion,
end now and then resorting to the
despised "shanks' mare,'' Robert
Jones came to the little town of
Snohomish, Wash.
Tramp Jones is a man who
would attract more than a passing
glance. He is tall and command
ing, with a gallant stride, in sharp
contrast to the usual slip-shod
slouch of a tramp. His clothes are
shabby and ragged, but cleaner than
the garments of the ordinary road
side Johnny. A slouch hat shows
under the brim a tangled mass of
tine gray hair, and the blue eyes
Jiave a frank twinkle that wins con
fidence â and meals.
The first citizen in Snohomish to
disecrjer the picturesque tramp-ar
rival was Frank Fowzcr, who
makes amateur photography his
fad.
Mr. Jones, by dint of much per
suasion, was induced to pose and
the accompanying photographs are
the result. The pictures have
gained much flattering comment
from Washington to Arizona for
the photographer, who is one of the
youngest on the coast.
Robert Jones is the name which
the original of these pictures claims.
There is no doubt that it is an as-

* VERTBODT knows that St. Valentine's day falli
on February 14, but probably very few can give
any accurate and intelligent account of its origin
' " or axe aware- of the fact that the good St. Val
entine, from whom it is named, never either directly
or indirectly bore any relation whatever to its
observances. When Christianity began to shed its
first- luminous, rays over Pagan Rome one of the
chief difficulties encountered In the conversion ol
the heathen was their deeply rooted attachment to
the many festivals and customs which they had so long
observed in honor of their many deities. The early
fathers of the church found it Impossible to detach them
from these ceremonies. Despairing at length of being
able to do so, they sought to so modify the form of these
heathen observances as to give them a religious charac
Â¦ ter, thereby transmogrifying them into Christian cere
monies held upon the same dates.
From many centuries before Christ the Romans had
been accustomed to hold great feasts in honor of Pan
v and June during February, from which month the latter
deity derived her additional names of Februata, Feb
rualis and Februlla. These festivities were known as
the Lupercalla, and during their continuance, among
a great many other ceremonies, sm:Jl tablets bearing
the. names of young women were placed in a box and
drawn out by the young men after the manner of a lot
tery. Each person drawing was in honor bound to be
the'faithful attendant of her whom he had drawn until
twelve months had rolled around and brought another
Lupercalia and a new drawing, though it not unfre
quently happened that long before that time the constant
association thus engendered had caused this sham mat
rimonial engagement to terminate in a real one.
For these heathen festivities of the Lupercalla the
early fathers substi
tuted those of St. 0

change, as well as to the highly colored, comi- >i
cal and satirical wood cuts with a few lines of-^S.
doggerel printed beneath them, which are so liber-
ally displayed in the stationer's windows at this time.
It has been stated that it was from the fact that St.
Valentine was renounced for his . universal lovo
Â«end charity that the custom of choosing love partners
upon his day and calling them by his name took its
rise, but this idea was long ::ince exploded. It is now
trell known that the only reason why these observances
are associated with St. Valentine is the one already
givenâ that the early fathers desired to Christianize the
heathen festival of the Lupercalia and to have it fall
" upon a sacred day of approximate datp.
The good churchmen found it impossible to pen-uade
the common people to entirely abandon any ceremony
to which they had become deeply attached. Despairing-.
therefore, of abolishing the matrimonial lottery of the
Lupercalla, they modified its form and endeavored to
give it a religious character by substituting the names
of particular saints to be drawn as valentines instead of
the names of men and women. From this ancleot u^nsa
Is derived the custom, still occasionally observed In so:nÂ«
Catholic countries, of Selecting on St. Valentine's day
for the ensuing year a patron saint who Is called a val
entine. But the young men and maidens finding little
amusement in drawing out the names of dead and gone
paints soon relapsed into their o!d custom of drawing
each other, and oven at the present time in many of the
rural districts of England and Scotland it is customary
on the eve of St. Valentine's. day for the young people
of both ser.es to draw lots for a valentine. As the men
draw from a has? containing the names of the maids,
Â¦while the latter draw from one containing the names of
the men: it generally happens that each person lias two
'valentines, but the yours men regard themselves mucri
more strongly bound to the valentine they have drawn
than to the one who has drawn them. If. as sometimes
happens, a young man and woman should each chance
to draw the other it is regarded as absolutely certain
that they are destined tq v.'cd, and must not under any
circumstances permit their attention or affection to cen
ter elsewhere. â¢
During the reign of Charles 11, as we learn from that
most Interesting and curious record of the domestic life
of that period preserved for us In the diary of Mr.
Pepyo, married people were equally, eligible with single
Â¦ - .
ones for tha lottery of St. Valentine* eve, and any one
chosen as a valentine was in honor bound to give a
present to the person choosing: him or her. On St. Val
entine's day, 1067, Mr. Pepys writes: "This . morning
came up to my wife's bedside (I being: up dressing my
self) little Will Mercer to be her valentine, and brought
her name written upon blue paper In gold letters, done
by himself, very pretty; and we were both well pleased
with it. But I am also my wife's valentine, and it will
cost me Â£5; but that I must have laid out it we had not
been valemines." On February 16 of the same yearâ two
days laterâ he again writes; "I find that Mrs. Pierce'a
little girl is my valentine, she having- drawn me, -which
I was not sorry for, it easing me of something more that
I must have given to/others. But here I do first observe
the fashion of drawing mottoes, as well as names, so
that Mercer, who drew my wife, flid draw also a motto,
and this girl drew another for me. What mine was I
forget, but my wife's was 'most courteous and most
fair,' which, as it may be used, or an anagram upon each
mime, might be very pretty." Again, alluding to the ob
ligation resting upon a chosen valentine to give a pres
ent to the person choosing, he writes of the celebrated
Miss Stuart, afterward Duchess of Richmond: "The
Duke of York,, being once her valentine, did give her a
jewel of about Â£300." In February, 16SS, he makes the'
follov/ing entry: "This evening my wife did with great
pleasure show me her stock of jewels, increased by tli*>
ring sho hath made lately, as my valentine's gift this
year, n Turkey stone set with diamonds. With this Dnd
what she had she reckoned that she hath above one
hundred and fifty pounds' worth of jewels of onÂ« kind
or other: and I am glad of It, for It is fit the wretch
should have something to content herself with." Good
Mr. Fepys here uses the word wretch as an endearing
term.
t Afield I went amid the morning: dew
Before the sun had chased the stars away.
To milk my klne (for so should housewives do).
Thee first I spiedâ and thÂ© first swain we sea
In spite of fortune shall our true love be.
Shakespeare also alludes to this custom la "Hamlet,"*
jre poor Ophelia sings:
To-morrow Is St. Valentine's day.
All In the morning betlme.
And I a maid at your window
To be your valentine.
In a series of quaint essays published In 1754-56 one
who signs herself "A Forward Miss" thus writes on
some of the observances of the occasion: "Last Friday
was Valentine's day, and the nighÂ£ before I got flyÂ© bay
leaves and pinned four of them to the four corners of
my pillow and the fifth to the middle, and then if I
dreamt of my sweetheart, Betty said, we should be mar
ried before the year was out. But to make It more sure
I boiled an egg hard and took out the yolk and filled It
with salt, and when I. went to bed ate it, shell and all,
without speaking or drinking after It. We also wrote
our lovers' names upon bits of paper and rolled them up
In clay and put them into water, and the first that rose
up was to be our valentine. Would you think It? Mr.
Blossom was my man. I lay abed and shut my eyes all
the morning till he came to our house, for I would not
have seen another man before him for all the. world."
The custom of exchanging amatory addresses be
tween valentines upon St. Valentine's day, to which I
have already alluded. Is a very old one. Chaucer haÂ»
left some very quaint models of this style of composition,
as has also the poet Lydgate, who died In 1440. A famous
writer of these valentines was Charles, Duke of Orleans,
who waa taken prls
-^^ oner at the battle of
Aglncourt. Drayton,

AMY F. STOCKTON.
Spoon crazes and monogram fan epidemics have
been succeededed by a rational and useful mania, and
that is that each one has her own especial hobby, tha
more useful and practical the better. One person has
chosen plates for her specialty, and plates of all sizes
and shapes will soon adorn her rooms. Each place on
her travels will be remembered by a. plate, while all
her friends -and relatives have been notified that plates
w!ll be most acceptable for Â¦ birthday and Christmas
rrifts. Another lady has the unique idea of collecting:
v. set of anniversary cups and saucers. Whenever her
wedding day rolls around she adds a cup and saucer.
One fair maiden, a bride-to-be,. is making a collection
of fine towels, nnd they are beauties, all embroidered
with the colors of the rooms in which they are to bÂ«
usedâ a dozen In red, a dozen in blue, and so on.
Cut g!as3 makes a charming collection and it is
surprising how quickly the pjeces accumulate. A lady
whose home Is exquisitely diinty confessed that she
saved her climes most religiously and then waited for
a bargain in what she was wanting. The handker
chief fad seems to have struck the city very hard this
.vinter, and fine hem-stitching has become the rage. A
collection of dainty "mouchoirs" is the pride of every
girl's heart, ttnd "handkerchief" parties are quite the
thing. Each girl brings her work: it is such a fine op
portunity, to show off one's dainty . thimble and gor
geous chatelaine with its scissors and other workbox
attachments. Sewing is rapidly coming to the front as
a line art, and taking its long vacant place in the many
accomplishments of the nineteenth century maidens.
An apron craze is also evident, from the sheer gauzy
affairs to big practical colored aprons for kitchen use.
'A collection of aprons Is a most acceptable gift to. a
young housekeeper.
A very intellectual girl regards books as her fad.
Each one is duly Inscribed; and she points proudly to
the ca3e filled with them, each one a souvenir of some
city, time or memorable occasion. Still another collec
tion is being made of Chinese and Japanese articles of
all descriptions. This is a most interesting study and
the case is filled with everything: from a fine ..â¢Jtlque
vase to a hideous idol. .
Admirers- of Sir Walter Scott will remember tint
he also alludes, to this custom of giving valentine pres
ents and v.'!!l readily recall the passae* in the "Fair
Moid of Perth." ij) which he describes the little St. Val
entine's (\uy gift which the mighty armorer. Homy
Smith, had prepared for- his valentine, the good and
beautiful Catharine Glovrr. It was a small ruby cur
into the form of ahcart. transfixed with a golden arrow,
.and was ii .closed # in a small purse made of link* of the
finest work in st'c^l, as if It had been designed for a
hauberk to a ring. Round the verge of the purse were
these words:
In many parts of England and Scotland it is still cus
tomary, as it has been for many centuries., for young
men and women to regard as their valentine the first
person of the opposite sax whom their eyes behold on
the morning of St. 'Valentine's* day, and they have the
right to claim the sairi valentine with a kiss, which he
or she is in honor bound to accord without rc3istanceor
remonstrance of any kind. Scott in his novel of "The
Fuir Maid of Perth." beautifully describes the manner
In which the peerless Catherine Glovor thus claimed the
bold armorer, H-nry Smith, as her valentine after he
had saved her from dishonor by his great valor and
strength on St. Valentine's eve. The English poet Gay
also alludes to this custom as follows:
Last Valentine, the day when birds of kind
Their paramours' with mutual chirpings find,
I early rose just at the break of day,are reddened, and then comes the powder-
Ing 1 . This is generous in any case, but
especially so among the dancing girls.
They whiten their faces over the rouge
until they are sometimes like 'ghosts.
Face, n^ck and arms are powdered. The
loose costume shows the neck low and
the arms high.
"The dressing takes time. It i's simple

charge of the entire wardrobe with ths
occasional assistance of a maid or a
grotvn daughter. The mother makes the
gowns and keeps them in order.

Admiration? Well, admiration may exist,

It is the worst of bad form to compliment

taken. A*s for kissing, that i 3 unknown.
So if a brother thinks his sister looks
especially charming- or if a lover waxes

"Whether they really succeed in being

an old magazine, " 'Compared to their

About the be^inninff of this century a

strange theory Is row being tested by
many person? in Russia, and. accordlcs to
a report which has been issued, their al
most complete abstinence from food has
produced no harmful result, and has even
from their standpoint proved highly
beneficial. These pecr^ live at St. Peters

around the large stove and slumber day
and night. Once in the twenty-four hours
they get up and refresh themselves with
a morsel of hard bread baked last autumn
and a drinle of water, after which they

THE teapot hummed blithely. Japan
ese sweetmeats stood upon the
table. A chrysanthemum screen
ehot across the comer arid a stork
vase loomed up on the piano. These
mer# all the outward ar.d visible signs
cf the lady who has just returned from
Japan.
She !cl!e4 la a klnscno and waved a
f'ow fas. So much for background to
fcer Biosy.
"As for the beauty cf the Japanese
weman." she said, "it le ail nature and
all art.
"'Shal! I run through the system cf toi
let? Y."eU. in the first place you must
kr.ow that cleanliness is cot only next
to godliness 5n Japan, but part and parcel
cf it. Bathing is a mania with the Japan
ese. One bath a day is a matter of
course and two baths are more common.
As I passed along the streets of Japan
I noticed bathhouses everywhere. Their
privileges cost little and the slight ex
perse Is not to be discussed. Saloons are
ret, you know, but the bathhouse is in
stead the place of popular resort- Some
years ago. I am told, ladies used to re
ceive while In the bath, but I never saw
anything cf this custom during: my visit.
"More tea? And a cake, to be sure.
"Now about the bath. All of your
beauty doctors are preaching the virtue
cf water, water pure and simple. The
Japanese know all about this virtue.
There is no need to preach it to them.
Every house, no matter how humble, has
a private bath, end the custom Is for the
men of the family to bathe iirst, as
they arÂ« the important peo-
pie; the women follow,
then the children,
thea the eer-
? â¢nta.
The -water is the bath is heated by a.
small charcoal stove that is attached to
the tub. One of the women may often
be seen blowing the fire through a bam
boo tube while the others in turn splash
and scrub in the warm water. They use
crdinary soap. Away from the cities it Is
nothing uncommon to see a woman bath
irig near tbe road, using her own little
wooden washbowl, which is . not much
bigger than a quart pail.
'"The massage is a serious business to a
Japanese beauty. The poorer classes can-
# not afford its luxury, but it is customary
in swelldom. Here is a picture of the
blind Â£hampooer, whose accomplishments
include massage, lie visits the homes of
his patrons and gives a kneading to the
roly-poly little bodies in the position you
see here. The victim lies upon a mat on
the floor, with her head on the block pil
low. The position is the same as during
the siesta. Xo wonder you should think
her neck would grow stiff. But it doesn't.
The whole secret lies in being used, to it.
You know the proverb about hanging.
The Japanese woman has been brought
up with her head upon the block, so she
knows nothing better. Furthermore, she
Is as dociie as a doll, so she would submit
whether she wanted to or not. She has
no light to like or dislike anything.
"The massage is given with the
clothes on or off. according to
choice. It lends a helping
hard toward making
these little bodies
what they V
drowsy, comfortable, placid. A womw
comes away from the treatment blinking
her almor.d eves aad yawning co\*ertly.
"The hair-dressing; Is an elaborate pro
cess. The hair is shampooed by profes
gionals. It is plastered and pasted and
carefully brought to the conventional
stiffness. Hair-dressing is much simpli
fied by the fashion for only one style.
This is universal. Back hair drawn âup
to a great coil near the top of the head
and a pompadour at the front; top and
sides. Think of ail the time we spend
studying our angles and curves and long
est lines to dress the hair accordingly I
How we shift it from high to low, from
straight to curled, and what neat little
fortunes the hairdressers pile up as
a result: And think of having o^^'

is made from the camellia flower, and is
extracted by the women themselves. Xo
adulterations and chemical frauds for
them.
"In dressing the hair it must be divided
into strands, as many as a dozen, and
this division is almost mathematically
correct. False hair Is used to twist into
the coil, for it must bejtopheavy, whether
or not nature has provided so. By the
way, isn't it odd that the hairdresslng is
done by touch alone, no combs being used
until it comes to the final fastening of the
locks? Then wooden. combs are used to
pin the hair, and all is ready for the or
naments.
"These consist of beads, countless col
ored ones, strung into the "bristly black
hair. Flowers blossom forth from all pos
sible places where they can cuddle, and
the tiny fans that you see in America are
common. Some of the little bobbing black
heads look like veritable flower gardens.
"The most skillful work comes in the
facial makeup. The women attend to this
themselves, and they have to learn the
art while they are young girls. Glance
into a house as you ride or walk by, and
you will see a woman at her toilet many
a time. The houses all open on the street,
you know, so nothing of the process is
hi'lden. There sits, or kneel?, my lady
upon the floor before her mirror. A soft,
thin little cushion laid on the matting
keeps her knees from growing weary, and
with her brass basin on the floor beside
her and her cosmetics all in order she
is ready to becin.
"The race must first be bathed. You see
there is no limit to the amount of bathing
Indulged in. Then comes the rouging.
"Brushes and cloths will be found in the
wee drawers pf the dressing tafcie, stowed
away for the makeup hour. A great deal

America or France. The lips and checkssi FLUFF and a flyaway â this is tlie parasol of 190Q, xÂ»
they say a: the City of Peris.
To be sure, there are suck things as sizid end dt
inure farascls in the coming summer's styles. Bui they will re
main behind the counters waiting to be called for. and the shop
windows will be all a-rtutier zvith chiffon whimsicalities.
Perhaps the designer zcas locking ci a blossoming teach tret
when he conceived thai pink affair. The white sUk foundation
makes the over puffing of pink chirr or. nzore delicate, you notice.
There is a pearl-gray encci beside it thai was created alone
for the slender, dark-haired, pale-faced Madonna girl. It looks no
more than a put? of smoke against the skx. Chirrcn ever silk â
yards upon yards of rxdzed ckiifon thai makes circles for the length
of the ribs.
There is to be lace this summer as zvell as chirrcn â sometimes
along with it. There are dozens of patterns in tucks edged with
laceâ the silk is tucked up and tucked dozen end tucked from side
to side. The finish of these parasols is a tucked bounce edged with
lace. You can have any color your fancy dictates so long as vis
gay enough; but if you must be consenctive. there's a white sUk
with narrow brown stripes and cream lace ru&e thai is perhaps. cU,
the smarter for its attempted severity.
You are safe this. year zvith any kind of a plcid. The combi
nations would do credit to a professional cake-zcalking zcaisicoct.
But mind this: If you carry a plaid you are not cUozi'cd chirfon
or lace; a plaited rutJle of the same silk is the only finish. There
is a zvctermelon dream of green and pink; the green and white
one is a bit cooler for midsummer beaches; the purple and white,
and black and white, make a feeble pretense at demurazess.
The plain-edged parasol is of the past. If there is no rutrle of
chitfonjace or silk, then at an\ rate, there must be a contrasting lace
braid for the edge. This is usually of black, and it is Frencky en
a rose pink or gaslight green silk, although less picturesque thai: the
cloudy chiffons which catch every breeze.
Avoid satin except in black, white or dull colors. Silk is the
thing. Here is a decree of fashion which is based solely upon gcod
taste, or art, if the word pleases better. Do you remember the mad
dening scarlet satins of a few years back thai feminine folly
blazoned upon a background of August weather? Take advantage
of this season's daintiness while it lasts, and encourage it for the
future.

THE SUNDAY CAXi.
DAINTY SPRING PARASOLS FOR MAIDENS FAIR AND
6T'UST why things are as they are in the world of men's fash-
ions this year nobody knows. Xobody ezcr does know. Perhaps
the Prince of Wales betook himself to the latest afternoon tea
attired in frock coat of Vicuna cloth, and hence the decree that Vicuna
cloth was the only possible material for frock coats. Perhaps the
Duke of Marlborough hied himself along the Strand one day in a
gray overcoat hanging belozv the knees, and hence the decree that
overcoats should be long and gray. Hozcevcr they originated, those
are the styles.
As for the sack suit, you gentlemen need not disturb your
selves seriously, for there is to be no radical change in it for the
season of 1900, so says Meyer Wood, of S. N. Wood & Co. Have
your new one dark in color and you will be on the safe side, al
though gray will by no means be forgotten. There is an inkling
of dark green ciieviot, but it is too early to foretell the popularity
of this novelty. Serge and chez'iot are in all cases the proper ma
terial. Vests for these suits are double-breasted and cut high; the
latter tendency is balanced by cutting the coats short. They are
more bobtailed in the back than ever before, so it is a happy year
for the tall and slender man, who gains breadth and loses height
thereby.
As for the cutaways â they are wonders. Not the church
going cutaways, to be sure. Gentlemen will continue to listen to the
sermon in the proverbial black coat, only showing a tendency to
shorter tails when they rise for the hymns. But the cutaways for
other occasions! Checks and plaids have arrived and appear to
mean business. These swagger affairs have side pockets. They are.
worn with trousers of a light gray stripe.
Don't invest in a frock coat unless you have a tine figure. Of
course xou all have, so to proceed. Have the coat made as of old,
save that Vicuna cloth and wide, satin-faced lapels are of neces
sity. But whether you wear the frock coat or not, you must have
the Tuxedo â better known as dinner coat or evening jacket. Vicuna
or Drap d'Etc arc good materials; a little bird Hying from Nrj)
York chirps concerning a rougher goods used there. The szvellest
of these coats will be worn fastened with one button just below the
lepeU.
Short overcoats are no more, except for driving. The long
ones hang full from the slwulders down, both in back and front.
Outside pockets are not permitted.

"So." he said. In slow, formidable tones.
"So! This all comes from your accursed
vanity, your bsthins-suit. your idiocy!
You have murdered your best frlead."
He turned away. His companion reeled
as If stricken by an unexpected arm.
He stretched out his hands. "Tom.
Tom," wailed he, beseeching, "don't be
such a foo!."
The broad back of his friend was occu
pied by a contemptuous sneer.
Three shii>s fell off the horizon. Land
ward, the hues were blending. The whis
tle of a locomotive sounded from an in
finite distance as if tooting in heaven.
"Tom! Tom! My dear boy," quavered
the freckled man, "don't speak that way
to me."
"Oh. no, of course not." said the other,
t<tUl facing away and throwing the words
fiercely over Ms shoulder. "You suppose
I am going to accept nil this calmly,
don't you? Not make the slightest ob
jection? Make no protest at all, hey?"
"Well, IâIâ"I â Iâ" began the freckled man.
The tall man's wrath suddenly explod
ed. "You've abducted me! That's the
whole amount of it! You've abducted
me!"
"I ain't," protested the freckled . man.
"You must think I'm a fool."
The tall man swore, anil sitting down
dangled his legs angrily in the water.
Natural law compelled his companion to
occupy the other end of the raft.
Over the waters little shoals of fish
spluttered, raising tiny tempests. Langufd
Jellyfish floated near, tremulously waving
a thousand lega. A row of porpoises
trundled along like a procession of cog
wheels. The sky became greyed save
where over the land eunset colors were
assembling.
Tho two voyagers, back to back and nt
either end of the raft, quarreled at length.
"What did you want to foller me for?"
demanded the freckled man In a voice of
indignation.
"If your figure hadn't been so like a
bottle we wouldn't be here," replied the
tall man.

The fires In the west blazed away and
Folemnity spread over the sea. Electric
lights began to blink like eyes. Night
t'> them the freckled man found he could
by a peculiar movement of his legs and
arms encase himself in his bathing dress.
The tall man was compelled to whistle
and shiver. As night settled finally over
the sea red and green lights began to dot
the blackness. There were mysterious
shadows between the waves.
"I see things comln'," murmured the
freckled man.
"I wish. 1 hadn't ordered that new dresa
suit for the trip to-morrow night," said
the tall man reflectively.
Tho sea became uneasy and heaved
painfully, like a lost bosom, when little
forgotten heart. bells try to chime with a
pure sound. The voyagers cringed at
magnified foam on distant wave crests.
A moon came and looked at them.
"Somebody's here," whispered the
freckled man. Â¦
"I wish I had an almanac," remarKed
the tall man regarding the moon.
Presently they fell to staring at the red
and green lights that twinkled . about
them. â¢',
"Providence will not leave us." asserted
the freckled man.. â¢ ;

He suddenly ceased arid turned to stone.
At a distance a great, green eye was con
templating the sea wanderers...
They stood up*and_did-anbther-dance.
As they watched the eye grew larger.
Directly, the^orm of a phantom-like ship
came Into view. About the "great, 'green
eye there bobbed "small yellow dots. The
wanderers could hear a far-away creak-
Ing of unseen tackle and flapping: of
shadowy sails. There came the melody of
But almost Immediately the tall man
got up and bawled miscellaneous infor
mation. He stamped his foot and-frown
ing Into the night swore threateningly.
The vessel seemed fearful â¢of these
moaning voices that called from; a hid
den cavern of the water. And now one
voice was filled with a menace. A num
ber-of men with enormous limbs that
threw vast shadows over the sea as .the
lanterns flickered held -a debate and made
gestures. . - 'â¢
tiff In tho darkness, the tali man be
gan to clamor like a mob. The freckled
man sat' In astounded silence, with his
legs weak.
After a time one of the men .of enor
mous limbs seized a rope that was tug
ging at .the stern and drew a small boat
from the shadows. Three ghuits clam
bered in and rowed cautiously toward the
raft. Silver water flashed in the gloom
as the oars dipped. \ '
About fifty feet from the raft the boat
stopped, "who er you?" asked' a voice.
Â¦Â¦.The/tall jnan braced himself and.ex
plained. He drew vivid pictures, his
twirling fingers illustrating like live
brushes.
"Oh," said the three giants.
The voyagers" deserted the raft. ,, They
looked back, feeling In their hearts a mite
of tenderness for the wet planks, : Later
they wriggled up the side of the vessel
and climbed over a railing.
,On .deck, they met a man.
He held a lantern to their faces. "Got
any e.hewin' tewbacca?" he Inquired. =
. "No," said the tall man. "we ain't." Â¦
The man had a bronzed face and a soli
tary whisker. " Peculiar lines about his
mouth were shaped into an eternal smile
of derision. His feet were bare and clung
handily to crevices. Fearful trousers
wore supported . by apiece of suspender
that went up the "wrong Side of his chest
and camoi down thÂ«v. right side of his
back, dividing him into triangles.

-"Ah," said. the tall man; "delighted,- I'm

There were, a few -moments of silence;
The giants were hovering in the gloom

The freckled man grunted. He seemed

Directly the tall man went and lay
down and began to groan.
The freckled man felt the miseries of
the world upon him. He grew angry at
the tall man for awakening him. They
quarreled.
"Well." said the tall man finally, "we're

"I know that." said the other sharply.
They regarded the ceilinpr in silence.
"What in thunder are we going to do?"
demanded the tall man. after a time. His
companion was still silent. "Say." re
peated he angrily, "what In thunder are
we going to do?" '
.'I., am sure I don't know." said the
freckled man. in a dismal voice.
"Well, think of something," roared the
other. "Think of something, you old fool.
You don't want to make any more idiots
of yourself, do you?"
"I ain't made an idiot of myself."
"Well, think. Know anybody In the

"I know a man up In Harlem," maid the
freckled man.
"You know a fellow up In Harlem."
howled the tall man. "Up in Harlem!
How in the dickens are we to â say, you're
crazy!"
"Well, we can take a cab," cried the
ether, waxing indignant.
The tall man grew suddenly calm. "Do
you know any one else?" he asked meas
uredly.
"I know. another fellow somewhere on
Park place."
"Somewhere on Park place." repeated
the talrman In an unnatural manner.

the tall man feigned to prodigiously
snore. The freckled man thought with
such vigor that he fell asleep.
After a timo he dreamed that he was In
a forest where bass drums grew on treea.
There came a strong wind that banged
the fruit about like empty pods. A fright
ful din was in hla ears^
He awoke to find the captain of the
schooner standing over him.
"We're at New York now," said thÂ«
captain, raisins: his voice above the
thumping and banging that was being
done on deck, "an* I suppose you fellers
wanta gt> ashore."
He chuckled in an exasperating manner.
"Jes* sing out when yeh wanta go," hÂ«
added, leering at the freckled man.
The tall man awoke, came over and
grasped the captain by. the throat.
"If you laugh again 111 kill you." be
The captain gurgled and waved his legs
and arms.
"In the first place." the tall man con
tinued, "you rescued us in a deuced: v
shabby manner. It makes me ill to think
of it. I've a mind to mop you 'round
Just for that. In the second place, your
vessel is bound for Athens, N. x.. and
there's no sense in it. Now. will you or
will you not turn this ship about and tak*
us back where our clothes are, or to Phil
adelphia, where we belong?"
He furiously shook the captaitt. Then
he eased his gTlp and awaited a reply.
"I can't," yelled the captain. "I can't.
This here vessel don't belong to ma. I've
got toâ Â¦*'
"Well, then." interrupted th* tall man,
"can you lend us some clothes?"
"Hain't got "em." The captain backed
away. His face was red and his eyes
were glaring.
"Well, then," said the tall man. advanc
ing, "can you lend us some money?"
"Hain't got none." replied the captain,
promptly. Something overcame him and
he laughed.
"Thunderation!" roared the tall man.
He seized the captain, who began to have
wriggling contortions. The tall man
kneaded him as If he were biscuits. "You
infernal scoundrel." he bellowed: "this
whole affair is some wretched plot. And
you are jn it. I am about to kill you."
The solitary whisker of the captain did
acrobatics like a strange demon upon his
chin. His eyes stood perilously from hia
head. The suspender wheezed and tugged
like the tackle of a sail.
Suddenly the tall man released his hold.
Great expectancy sat upon his features.
"It's going to break," he- cried, rubbing
his hands.
But the captain howled and vanished la
the sky.
The freckled man then cams forward.
He appeared filled with sarcasm.
"So! said he. "So! You've settled thÂ«
matter. The captain Is the only man !n
the world who can help us. and I daro say
he'll do anything he can row."
"That's all right," said the tail man.
"If you don't like the way I run thinjra
you shouldn't have come on this trip at
all."
They had another quarrel.
At the end of It they went on deck. The
captain stood at the stern addressing thÂ»
bow with opprobrious language. "When
he perceived the voyagers he began to
fling his fists about in the air.
"fm goin' to put yeh off." he yelled. ThÂ«
wanderers stared at each other.
"Hum," said the tall man.
The freckled man looked at his com
panion. "He's going to put us off, you
Â¦cc " he said complacently.
The tall man began to walk about and
move his shoulders. "I'd like to sea you
do It." he said defiantly.
The captain tugged at a rope. A boat
came at hia bidding. "I'd like to see you
do It." the tall man repeated continually.
An imperturbable man In rubber boot.<*
climbea down into the boat and seized the
oars. ThÂ© captain motioned downward.
His whisker had a triumphant appear
ance.
The two wanderers looked at the boat.
"I guess we'll have to get in." murmured
the freckled man.
The tall man was standing Hko a gran
ite column. "I won't.'" said he. "I won't!
I don't care what you r!o. but I won't."
"Well, butâ" expostulated the other.
They held a furious debate.
In the meantime the captain was dart
ing about making sinister gestures, hut
the back of the tall man held him at bay.
The crew, much depleted by the depar
ture of the imperturbable man into the
boat, looked on from the bow.
"You're a fool." the freckled man con
cluded hla arsrument.
"So?" Inquired the tall man, highly ex
asperated.
"So? Well. If you think you're so
bright we'll go in the boat and then you'll
see."
He climbed down Into the craft an<l
seated himself in an ominous manner at
the stern.
"You'll see." he said to his companion,
as the- latter floundered heavily down.
"You'll see!"
The man In rubber boots calmly rowetl
the boat toward the dock. As they we.it,
the captain leaned over a railing and
laughed. The freckled man was seated
very victoriously.
"Well, wasn't this the right thing after
all?" he Inquired in a pleasant voice. Tha
tall man made no reply.
As they neared the dock something
Â¦eemed suddenly to occur to the freckled
man.
"Great heavens." he murmured. He
stared at the approaching snore.
"My, what a plight, Tommie," he quav
ered.
"Do you think so?" spoke up the tall
man. "Why. I really thought you liked
it." He laughed- in a hard voice. "Lord,
what a figure you'll cut."
This laugh jarred the freckled man's
soul. He became mad.
"Thunderation. turn the boat around!"
he roared. "Turn 'er "round, quick. Man
alive, we can't turn 'er 'round, d'ye
hear?"
The tall man In the stern gazed at his
companion with glowing eyes.
"Certainly not." he said. "We're jrolarr
on. You insisted upon it." He began to
prod his companion with words.
The freckled man stood up and waved
bis arms.
"Sit down." said the tall man. "Tou'U
tip the boat over."
The othpr began to shout.
"Sit down." said the tall man again.
Words bubbled from the freckled man's
mouth. There was a little torrent of sen
tences that almost choked him. And he
protested passionately with his hands.
But the boat went on to the shadow et
the docks. The tall man was Intent upon
balancing it as it rocked dangerously
during his comrade's oration.
"Sit down," he continually repeated.
"I won't." raged the freckled man. "1
won't do anything." The boat wobbled
with these words.
"Say," he continued, addresxinf the
oarsman, "just turn this boat round, will

The oarsman looked at the sky and
thought, j. inally he spoke. 'Tra, dotn*

made another statement.
The schooner went pn. The two voy
agers sat down and watched. After a
time they began to shiver. The soft black
ness of the summer night passed away
and gray mists writhed over the sea.
Soon lights of early dawn went charging
across the sky and the twin beacons on
the Highlands grew dim and sparkled
faintly, as if a monster were dying. The
dawn penetrated the marrow of the two
men in 1 bathing dress.
The captain used to pause opposite
them, hitch one hand ,In his suspender
and laugh.
"Well, I be dog-hanged," he frequently
said.
The tall man grew furious. He snarled
in a mad Undertone to hia companion.

his back and bobbing his head. The sus

partially suppressed a cry and took a step
Â°The ai freckled man was sleepily insistent,
and shortly the captain gave over his
deprecatory contortions. He 'etched a
pink quilt with yellow, dots on it to the
freckled man and a black one with rea^
roses on It to the tall man.
Again he vanished In the nnnameni.
The tall man gazed until the last rem
nant of trousers disappeared from the
sky. Then he wrapped himself up In his
quilt and lay down. The f reckled man
was puffing contentedly, swathed like an
infant. The yellow polka dots rose and
fell on the vast pink of his chest.
The wanderers slept. In the quiet could
be heard the groanlngs of timbers as the
sea seemed to crunch, them together. The
lapping of water along the vessel s side
sounded like gasplngs. A hundred spirits
of the wind had got their wings entangled
in the rigging and in soft voices were
pleading to be loosened.
The freckled man was awakened by a
foreign noise. He opened his eyes and
saw his companion standing by his couch.
His comrade's face was wan with suf
fering. His eyes glowed In the darkness.
He raised his arms, .spreading them out
like a clergyman at a grave. He groaned
deep in his chest.

"Well, sunposin' he has missed youi

"Tom." again interrupted the other,
"produce jour proud clothes and we'll

The tall man swore bitterly. He went
to one <Â»f a row of littlo wooden boxes and
shut himself in it. His companion re
paired to a similar box.
At first he felt like an opulent monk in
a too-small cell a?:d he turned round two
or three tirr.es to see if he could. He ar
rived, anally; into his bathing dress. Im
mediately he droppe 1 gasping upon a
three-cornered beuch. The suit fell In
fnl<is about his reclining form. There was
riler.ee. save for the caressing calls of the
waxes without.
Then he heard two shoes drop on the
floor in one of the little coops. He began
to clamor at the boards like a penitent
at an unforgiving door.
"Tom. ' railed he; "Tomâ"
A voice of wrath, muffled by cloth, came
through the walls. "You go t" blazes."
The freckled man began to groan, tak
ing the occupants of the entire row of
coops into his confidence.
"Stop your noiso." angrily cried thÂ«
tall man from nis hidden den. "You rent
ed the bathing suit, didn't you? Thenâ"
"It ain't a bathing suit," shouted the
freckled man at the boards. "It's an au
ditorium, a ballroom or something. It ain't
a bathing suit."
The tall man came out of his box. His
suit looked like blue tkin. He walked
with grandeur down the alley between thÂ«
rows of coops. Stopping in front of his
friend's door, he rapped on it with pas
sionate knuckles.
"Come out of there, y' ol' fool," said he
in an enraged whisper. "It's only your
accursed vanity. Wear it anyhow. What
difference does it make? 1 never saw such
a vain ol' idiot:"
As he was storming, the door opened
and his friend confronted him. The tall
man's lf-gs gave way and he fell against
the opposite door.
tThe freckled man regarded him sternly.
"You're an ass," he said.
His bark curved in scorn. He walked
majestically down the alley. There was
pride in the way his chubby bare feet
patted the boards. The tall man followed,
weakly, his eyes riveted upon the figure
ahead.
As a disguise th<Â» freckled man had
adopted the stomach of importance. He
moved with an air of some, sort of pro
cession, across a board walk, down some
steps and out upon the sand.
There was a pug dog and three old
women on a bench, a man and a maid
with a book and a parasol, a seagull
drifting high in the wind, and a distant,
tremendous meeting of sea and sky.
Down on the wet sand stood a girl being
wooed by the breakers.
The freckled man moved with stately
Ir*-f>.' along the beach. The tall man,
numb with amazement, came in the rear.
ThÂ«*y neared the pirl.
Suddenly the tall man was seized with
convulsions. He laughed, and the girl
turned her head.
She perceived the freckled man in the
bathing-suit. An expression of wonder
ment overspread her charminc face. It
changed. In a. moment, to a pearly smile.
This smile seemed to smite the freckled
man. He obviously tried to swell and fit
his 6Uit. Then he turned a shriveling
glance upon his companion and fled up
the beach. The tall man ran after him.
pursued with mocking cries th.-it tingled
his flesh like stings of Insects. Ho seemed
to be trying to lead the way out of the
world. But at last he stopped and faced
about.
"Tom Sharp," Raid he between his
clenched teeth, "you are an unutterable
wretch! I could grind your bones under
my heel."
The tall man was in a trance with
glazed eyes fixed on the bathing-dress.
He seemed to be murmuring: "Oh. good
Lord! Oh. good Lord! I never saw such
a suit! I never paw such a suit!"
The freckled man made the gesture of
an assassin.
"Tom Sharp, you "
The other was Ftill murmuring. *'Oh,

in the waves.
The freckled man. in endeavoring to es
cape from mankind, had left all save a
solitary fisherman under a large hat. and
three boys In bathing dress, lauchipg and
splashing upon a raft made of old spars.
The two men swam softly over the
ground swells.
The threÂ« boys dived from their raft
snd turned their jolly faces shoreward.
It twisted slowly around and around and
began to move seaward on some unknown
voyage. The freckled man laid his face
to the water and swam toward- the raft
with a. practiced stroke. The tail man
followed, his bended arm appearing and
disappearing with the precision of ma
chinery.
The craft crept away, slowly and war
ily, as if luring. The little wooden plate
en the frr-ckled man's head looked from
the shore Jike a round, brown eye, but bis
gaze was fixed on the raft that slyly ap
peared to be waiting. The tall man used
the little xvooden plate as a beacon.
At length the freckled man reached
the raft and climbed aboard. He lay
down on his back and puffed. His bathing
dress spread about him like a dead bal
loon. The tall man fame, snorted, shook
his tangled locks and lay down by the

They were overcome with a delicious
drowsiness. The planks of the raft seemed
to fit their tired limbs. They gazed
dreamily up Into the vast sky of sum

"This is great," said the tall man. His
companion grunted blissfully.
Gentle hands from the sea rocked their
craft and lulled them to peace. Lapping
waves sang little rippling sea songs about
them. The two men Issued contented
groans.

They lay and thought.
A fish hawk, soaring, suddenly turned

Tho "Reminiscences" of John Hooker,

might have been Chief Justice If he had
not stood aside tor a friend, give a view
of a noble old-fashioned lawyer of unusual
purity and beauty of character. Some
what rambling and not free from prolix
ity, they still contain many an entertain
ing anecdote, many a piece of shrewd
thoughtfuiness. and not a few pretty pic
tures of the simplicity which ruled in this
country -at the beginning of the century-
The image of nobility and spotless Integ
rity which these records produce Is one to
make a man thank God and take courage.
The absence of finished literary form in
these memoirs will naturally keep them,
from attaining general popularity. They
have a value for the historian and for all
those who rejoice to know of good men.
The portrait of Mr. Hooker's benign and
distinguished face justifies the belief that

"The Scarlet Stigma is a play founded
upon Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter."
The stisrma is a mark of the letter A.

sciousness brooding over the wrong he
has done her. He enters a trance and In

the author of the book. He has attained,
considerable facility In writing a vigorous
but pedestrian blank verse and turns off
his prose conversations with distinct ease
and energy. The conception is forcible
and entirely within the bounds of possi
bility. But Mr. Smith's Imagination and
style are not sufficiently lofty and dis
tinguished to work with such a subject.
His devil is earthy and mechanical. His
horrors are material and curious, attract
ing the readers to investigate and theor
ize Instead of waking within him the sol

verse ingenuity, which reduces the story
of "The Scarlet Letter" from a poetic and
elevated tragedy with the awfulness of
mystery to a hard and horrible study in
mental and moral pathology. (James J.

THE CORKSCREW WORLD AND OTHER BOOKS
' ' m *f VERY few years an insane man of
.j more than usual energy and of un
| f common erratic intelligence, puts
Ml forth a new a_r.d extraordinary sci-
entire discovery. Sometimes the
secret of the Great Pyramid is ex
pounded, sometimes the Lost Ten
Tribes are discovered, sometimes the place
of hell is revealed by mathematics, some
times the earth is hollow, sometimes it
Is inside cut, and sometimes space has
Jour dimensions. Heaven and earth, learn
lTiff, tradition, history and nonsense are
collected in vast heaps of learning by the
theorists who put forward these views.
Contradictory hypotheses are reconciled
with startling oasre. Happy coincidences
ere established. A thousand unnoticed
discoveries prove to have been pointing
the way to the last great all-embracing
discovery cf the wonders of the world.
The simple-minded are struck with awe
and worship the new prophet. The per
verse half-educated embrace with fervor
a theory which proves the learned to be
mil tods. And the whole thing is eimpiy
Â«a jnsar.e man's obsession.'
Sonjetiraes a. charlata.n plays upon the
credulity of the public with a pretense of
eensational discoveries and wins a similar
following to the madman's; but his pro
ductions usually betray themselves by
ihelr mechanical coherence and lack of
emotional sincerity.
The latest "freaji" in the way of scien
tific discover}- is "The Diuturnal Theory
cf the Earth." by William Andrews, it
is a book to be spoken of with respect, for
Its sincerity, its Industry, Its wide range
cf reading, its singleness of purpose, of
this book we can be sure that no charla
tan wrote it. But it is insane. Its pro
cess of reasoning shows the rambling and
cloudy incoherence of an unsound mind.
At the Bitme time it exhibits the superfi
cial shrewdness in meeting objections
â¢which is often observed in monomaniacs,
and it iÂ» marked by the inexhaustible
energy of aberration. Above ail, it shows
unmistakable signs of monomania in the
excited manner In which external .and
accidental suggestions are seized upon aa
Â¦urport for the author's theory-
The teachings of the Diuturnal Theory
ef the Earth may be briefly summarized.
The earth is a ball cf semi-liquid sub
â¢tar.ee covered with a relatively thin, and
relatively flexible crust.
This crust clips upon the inner mass aa
the ckin of an orange if detached from
the pulp might ehp over it.
This movement is spiral, the north pole
<or the mass at the north pole) sliding
Bouthwestward until It reaches a point
sear the south pole, the whole of the
rest cf the crust moving so as to main
tain its relative conformation.
As the land reaches the equator it Is
elevated by the spheroidal form of thÂ«
Â«Â«rth and is depressed at the poles.
Glacial action, is caused by the passing
ct land under the polar Ice cap. Glacia
tlon rtcurs at regiiiar intervals of forty
two thousand or eighty-four thousand or
a hundred and twenty-six thousand yeais
by the completion of a half or a whole
Â¦piral turn.
The phenomena of successive geological
reriods are all explained by this simple
law. When land is in the tropics it pro
duces rich vegetable growth, to be stored
in future coal measures. In temperate
dimes civilization advances upon it. The
movement toward the poles forces its
fauna and fiora. to migrate, degenerate or
euffer destruction; and thus a new cycle
is bes~un.
Earthquakes are caused by slov.- waves
cf the crust as the crust moves over the
liquid interior.
The retardation cf the earth's revolu
tion, the disappearance of the Mound
Builders, the peculiarities of the Austra"
lisn marsupials and the phenomena of
terrestrial magnetism are all explained
ty this simple, comprehensive, beautiful
and Insane theory.
Other views of the author's, such as the
belief that the earth is possessed of life.
deserve passing reference. Naturally, be
ing alive, it would reject any inappropri
ate substances from its inward parts with
violence. In the slipping of the crust some
parts cf this tough, indigestible outward
tegument break oJE and are pushed into
the interior, which vomits them forth in
volcanoes.
The heat of the Â«arth is originally con
ceived cf by Mr. Williams. It is a sub
etance the most refined form of which is
magnetism. The earth has never lost any
heat and never can lose any heat, the
part supposed to bÂ« lost being magnetism,
Â¦which itself always retains , some . heat.
tnd which ie really caused by higher re
lationships between the earth and tht

take their place.
Mr. Andrew's life has a pathetic inter
est. He was born In IT3S In Philadelphia,
and did! in Cumberland. Md.. in ISS7. His
whole life was passed In humble obscur
ity. He was a drummer-boy in the war
of ISI2, was apprenticed to the Lippln
cotts in Philadelphia, learned the trade
of a bookbinder, and during the last fifty
years of his life followed that trade, Oe
sldes carrying on tv.o small stationery
fctoreF. . He devoted much of his time to
ttudy and the collection of a museum of
r.atural history. ?, iarsre part of his col
lection was purchased by the State of
New York, apart by a Maryland college.
a third part by the Maryland Academy of
Sciences. His business suffered from his
devotion tÂ» his studies, but he worked
on. looking for neither fame nor fortune.
He- published nothing, and cared nothing
for publishing. "Yet he felt assured that
his life work would get published some
time or other, and that, as he often said,
?lbe r.^xt century would appreciate it.' "
That fcis book is now published is Jue in
part to the filial piety of his daughter,
and in the preface to the work the public
Is informed that Mr. Andrews "has left
important writings upon psychology and
philosophy which perhaps represent as
great an advance beyond present thought
in those departments as the stride made
by his diuturnal theory in the department
of geology." (Myra Andrews and E. t o.
Stevens, is West Forty-fifth street. New
York.)
"Campaigning in the Philippines," by
Karl Irving Faust, is a. compilation of the
facts in regard to the service of the vol
unteers in the islands. A certain amount
of general information as to the charac
ter of the natives, the condition of the
Philippines under Spanish rule, the .cli
mate and geography and the like is also
afforded. The bqok is illustrated by nu
merous photographs taken on the spot.
Mr. Kaust cmploye-2 a man in each regi
ment to write the story of the se^pce
performed by the troops of the regiment,
and had access to the official records so
far as military regulations would permit.
The Rev. Peter MacQuecn collected data
from the headquarters of the larger mili
tary commands, maps were made by the
official map maker of the second division
of the Eighth' Corps, and in all points
great pains were taken to secure accu
racy of detail.
In special euitions for each State which
sent volunteer regiments to the Philip
pine Islands are printed .full lists from
the official record* of the name and ad- (
dress of every man in every regiment'
from that State, with complete details,
as to rar.k, promotion, casualties and dis
charge.
The book will interest all volunteers and
their personal friendsâ that is. everybody.
It Is vigorously written and exhibits
great energy and ability In bringing a
great mass of scattered material into a
connected whole. Yet there are some
points which mar the general excellence
of the work. The narrative is not broadly
planned or consecutively presented, and
there is no geographical analysis of the
different movements of the forces, so that
mere blind fighting seems to have been
all that was done. Ptrrr-inal and impor
tant details are obtruded on the atten
tion â the most conspicuous instance being
a fine picture of the Gaelic opposite h
sample bill of fare of the dinner served
on the voyage, the whole looking mar
velously like an advertisement of the O.
and O. Steamship Company. This im
pression is confirmed by the fact that thÂ«>
location of the San Francisco office of the
company is carefully given.
The purposeless effect produced by the
narrative is increased by a large number
of photographs of dead Filipinos heaped
in their trenches, each photograph being
marked "Work of the Washington or
Kansas or California boys," as the case
might be. This horribly cynical view of
the objects of military operations is. let
us hope, a libel on the men, or at least
on the commanders of our forces. For
the presence of these pictures, horrible as
they are, there is ample justification,
though the legend under them is' im
proper. But for some of these pictures.'
such as loathsome views in Philippine
graveyards, it is impossible to say so
much. They appeal to and foster a de
pravity of taste which is already receiv
ing too much er.countsemtnt i n our coun
try.
Natural and excusable characteristics of
a volume complied as this was are a
choice of facts which will reflect credit
on everybody concerned, and an avoidance
of disagreeable truths. The discreditable
mortality at Camp Merritt. for example,
rs very lightly passed over. The incom
petence of many vo'unteer officers and
the consequent hardships of privates are

not at all suggested. A fact of Importance,
a statement of which would have cleared
up the plan of operations greatly, Â»was the
natural unwillingness of the commander
of our forces to send time-expired volun
teers, who might be recalled any day. to
any great distance from Manila. The
systematic operations which have broken
up the Filipino armies had of course to
wait for reKU'ars. A plain statement of
this hamperirtf influence would have re
flected no discredit on our heroic and self
sacrificing volunteers.
A painful impression is produced by thÂ«Â»
absence of any Kenerous words for the*
poor dead Filipino boys who were pileJ
in the trenches by the "work" of oui
volunteers. Whatever views may be taken
of the righteousness of our own acts
toward them, their devotion should com
mand the respect of every fair-minded
American. The capacity and organizing
skill of their leaders deserve some recog
nition also. I have seen a roster of a
Filipino company, written in a beautiful
hand and in good Spanish, with full de
tails as to the birthplace and next of kin
of each soldier, his height, the make of
his gun and his rank. "Difunto" (dead)
stood after many a name. An army the

sures the reader that the biographical no

the dry-as-dust data of blrthdates and
other statistical matters, but also to the
subtle influences which at home, in schools
or in the great world go far in the deter
mination of characters that are success
ful." The preface also gives the informa
tion that " 'facts are stubborn things,' and
they command respect." Hence since
"the Idea of The Successful American is
to present facts only, fulsome eulogy is to
be blue-penciled, and the biographies will
"fulsome." Of Matthew P. Breene's
"Thirty Years of New York Politics" the
affirmation is made that "no work Issuing
from the New York press, or, indeed, from
the press of the United States, has over
met with so brilliant a reception." G. C.

The magazine is vulgarly commercial in
tone, substance and language. It is writ
ten in inflated and incorrect English,
which would not be tolerated in any city
newspaper of which. l know. Its biog
raphies contain a great deal of twaddle
and far too little information. Yet bad as
it is it will probably be a convenience in
a newspaper office. It would be still more
useful if the portraits were so arranged
that none was printed on the back of an
other. Pray, heaven, send a better editor.

are given in the first number of the maga

statement of the method of calculating an

math- lable of past eclipsesâ the "saros of

large number of references to eclipses in
ancient records, and shows how the so rec
ords are used In fixing dates. The most
striking case Is the eclipse of the sun in
the reign of Chun-K'ang. a Chinese Em

the beating of gongs and drums, to dm c
off the monster who threatened to devour
the sun. two astronomers were put to

) W. H. Harvey. "Coin," has Just pub-
Ulshed a'discussion of "Money. Trusts and
'Imperialism." in which this coolly superior
) young- lecturer victoriously meets the ar
( guments of the wise and prudent and de
) clares the greatness of the Democratic
i party aa it has been revealed unto babes.
5 The positions which he seeks to establish
C are three. First, he affirms that banks
1 constitute, a money trust, the interest of
'. which is to diminish the supply of money
) In order that they may take advantage of
Â£ the needs of borrowers. Second, he de
) clarea that all other trusts are able to
' squeeze the people because of the support
\of the money trust. Third, he announces
' that the war for the conquest of the Phil
) ippines is kept up in order to create a
' large standing army, which shall accom
plish by arbitrary force the permanent
* subjugation of the American people under
a monarchical form of government.
The usual devices of blackboards, pic
tures and the descriptions of Coin's suc
cess in impressing his audience are em
, ployed in this book. There is the same
mixture of smooth fallacy and truth as
in the earlier "Coin" arguments. And
there is the same ingenuous affectation of

moment of silent contem

condray said:
"This Is a very irood
China tea. It would prob
ably bring about S5 cents
a pound in this market.
You took that from a
package marked B-K-47
and It is kept on the sec
ond shelf. Now this Is
some of the same lot we
tried first," he saJd as he
picked up the next tray.
"There Is no use testing
such stuff. I should like
an opportunity to test the
fellow's head who ever
thought of bringing such
an artlclo Into my studio.
"Now, let me see. Tes,
this is something odd.
Can't you notice some
thing peculiar about the
aroma of this lot?" I
said yes, but honestly I
did not. I thought It just
smelt lik<* tea, "I thought
you would be able to de
tect the difference. Well,
this Is a sample of the
high-priced Russian arti
cle I told you about In the
beginning. You took that
from the ll.ttle wicker
basket on the lower shelf:
you found no mark on
that package." And so he
parsed on from one tray
to another till all the sam
ples had been tested. Not
a mistake was made.
Every sample was segre
gated and the price given.
Even the packages from
which each was taken
was correctly named.
Now, said I. If you will
explain one thins: more I
will agree not to steal any
more of your valuable
time. Why do you make
all those vulgar noises
whllÂ» gointr through the
tests? "The answer Is
simple." he replied. "la
the first place. I suppose
you object to the noise
made by sipping: the tea
as soon as it Is drawn.
However. It Is quite nec
essary to do It In that
manner. Tea must be
tasted while It Is practi
cally boiling hot and one
Is obliged to draw a lot of
cold air In at the same
time to prevent burning
the mouth. The smarklr.tr
of the lips Is done that the
tongue* may come In quick
contact with the roof of
the mouth. All these lit
tle things Increase the
sense of taste."
Surely, this Is a stranÂ»Â«
profession.

with the salary paid in that business, a

"Of course," said Mr. Macondray, "It
must seem strange to- you that I should
choose tea-lasting as' a- profession, but I
will try and explain. my reason for so do
ing. In the first place, you must remem

'ft my mind was made up, and after a few weeks
-â T-~â ââ 1 â¢ of continuous argument I finally carried my
i /yCsf//. I point. It was arranged that I was to be sent to
"â¢^ China and Japan, where I was to be trained by
the best masters In the art of tea-tasting.
"My destination was Hongkong, where I was
placed under the care of. an Englishman who had served about five
years with one of the-great-Engllsh tea houses. I must admit that
after I had made the acquaintance of my tutor I felt less enthusiastic
about the fascinating, trade that I had d ecided to learn. But I was
In for It. and I suppose my American pride and grit, had a great deal
to do with keeping me, at it. I found him a thin, pale, nervous man,
apparently about 50 years of -age, and I was very much surprised to
learn that he was only 30. He looked for all, the world like a con
firmed opium fiend, and he was as notional: as a child. Of course, I
Boon learned from my companions that this condition was the result
of the pernicious effects of hl3 business. Like most, men who follow
It for a giving, he had adhered too closely to his business. There Is
but -one way for a man to retain his health In this dangerous trade,
and that ls to take occasional long rests. I. have made It a point
to abstain^ from tea-tasting at least eight months each year. How
ever, with' all this precaution, I haver my spells of extreme nervous
ness after each hard day's work, but as soon as I find myself getting
6haky I just close up my part of the shop and go away to some quiet
place, where tea-tasting Is unheard of. _^

called on one of my Chinatown samples .
We had better luck with the next sample. Mr Ma
condray seemed quite satisfied with what he was
pleased to call the sniff, and proceeded at once to the
drawing, which was done in the following manner: A
snail pinch O f the tea was placed in the bottom of one
of . the little porcelain cups, which he filled with the
boiling water and immediately the cup was full he

he regarded carefully until just two minutes had

professional "Now; for the taste." was Ms
next remark. He then put the cup to his lips and took
a lone sip. drawing it through between the lips wS
mafle such a Etrange selection In the way
of a profession. But he did, and I am
told by many men In the tea business that
he is at the head of his profession, too.
I found Mr. Macondray a quiet, modest

much from travel and observation. He
did not look n< all like a man who had

I then called Mr. Macon

light up the gas heater and.
fill the brass kettle with

FEW of our fair readers know that their fastidiousness in the choice of
the herb which cheers but not inebriates is the cause of the estab
lishment of a profession called "tea tasting." which means about
the fame to the men who follow it as the continued use of
opium. Each of the large importing houses of Great
UritaJn and America employs one of the tea tasters. The success
of the tea taster depends upon the accuracy and training' of .^^^^"ft?*
"The ladies find many other uses for
tea other than the mere drinking of it.
The beautiful Titian blonde hair, so
much admired by artists, is produced by
continued applications of the infusion,
and the practice is said to be quite harm
less. The housewife finds the wet leaves
the best possible agent for renovating
her fading carpets. Cold tea leaves are
nlso used by many as a cooling lotion for
inflamed eye's, and as/ a fertilizer for
house plants they are' unsurpassed. In
fact, there is no reason why the residue
of the teapot should ever bevwasted; in
fact, in China such prodigality is con
sidered v/ickedl At one time an English
tea merchant over there, took the trouble
to follow up the history of a package of
tea from the home of a rich Chinese. He
found that within one year it was used
over. at least four times. After the first
drawing the leaves became" the property
of the chief steward of the household,,
this functionary had them carefully dried
and repacked for the Chinese market
without attempting In any way to deceive
the buyer. The repacked article was
plainly marked No. 2, but the additional
fact that it was from the table of a cer
tain groat mandarin was also stated on
the lubel. wh!ch Insured immediate sale.
The middle-class man sent his purchase
through the same process, but after the
third drawing it was no longer consider
ed a luxuryâ still it was too good to be
thrown "awayâ and was finally given to
the poor of the village, who thought it a
munificent act of charity.
"Most housekeepers In -this country
have some definite idea of how i tea should
be made, hut I assure you this is not the
case in all parts of the world. In Eng
land, for instance, it is a common thing to
see the cook throw a handful of good tea
into a copper kettle, then fill the vessel
with water and boll the decoction until it
tastes like lye,' and I have no doubt it is
just about as wholesome. Our cooks know
better,' and, generally speaking, one may
expect a very fair cup of the beverage in
" any well regulated American home. The
process of tea-making is very simple, just
pour a teacupful of boiling water over
half a teasooonful of tea. let it draw
three minutes and you have.it.
"Now," said Mr. Macondray, "I am go
ing to show' you: what tea-tas*ilng really
means. I want to prove to you that there
is no such thlrg as guesswork in our
business; that knowledge can only come
through long years of experience. No man
has yet found a royal road to learning in
Â¦ this line. This is my. workshop," he said
as we stepped into a large room furnished
With a round table, a few chairs, a gas
heater, a large copper kettle and an im
mense cusp!dor. On the round table,
which was so constructed that the lop
revolved, were a number of delicate pr.r
â¢ celain cups, each provided with a cove /
which resembled an inverted saucer. One
of the walls of the room was covered v/itn
shelves containing possibly one hundred
â¢ samples of tea, some of them in small. tin
canisters, oihers in miniature tea baskets.
"On this, occasion I wish you to act a3
taskmaster. Â¦ If you will examine those
shelves you will find a nest of little tin
trays and any amount of samples of tea.
Now I am going to leave ; the room while
you select as many packages as you
choose to have tested. You will find tnat
each package is marked; some of the
marks may seem diacritical to youâ but
you can copy, them to suit yourself. Place
a -handful of each sample in one of tÂ».e
trays and mark them with numbers or
letters, (so 'that you may be able to com
pare '; them with the package ; from whlcn
you -take the "samples. Take your time
about this and be. careful that you make
â¢ no mistake In marking, for we are sure
to have a row If you forget your, symbols.

It i=cfms that the waves likewise have
something to say about tho matter. They

strings were made from the skin of the

a similar manner to the mandolin.
The skull was left so that the jaws were

with any sharp jolt the teeth came to

BOER HEAD LAAGER. LADYSMITH
Friday. Feb. 9.â lt is reported from the
Upper Tugela that in yesterday's fight
while driving the British across the river
with heavy loss to them, the Boers had
four men killed and eight wounded. On
retaking the kopje twenty-two Boers were
found killed.
The alarm was given at midnight that
the Ladysmith troops were trying to force
a passage In the direction of the Free
State laager. Heavy firing was heard,
but no particulars have been received.
J *OXDOX, Feb. n. â It is
I difficult to depict the feel
ing which prevailed here
yesterday concerning the news
from the front, both in regard to
General Buller's retirement and
Mac Donald's withdrawal to
Modder River, both of them after
having made what appears to
have been splendid fights.
To say that the public was sur
prised that Buller was compelled
to fall back again is not quite the
case, for after previous checks the
people were prepared for any
thing, knowing, as it has been
so clearly proved, how strongly
the Boers were posted and their
wonderful mobility. That every
body was disappointed is very
true, yet in clubs, hotels and else
where the only words heard were
to the effect that it was no use
of Builer trying to relieve Lady
smith that way.
"If at first you don't succeed,
try again" â that was the general
feeling. That Buller would not
SK.TBB . , ...
give up. even with a third re
pulse, but that he would soon be
at it again was what everybody
expected, but they did not ex
-
pect such news so soon as it did
arrive, for last night a dispatch
reached London saying that Bui
ler s retirement was but tempo
rary; that it was merely a tactical
nove and that the entire force
ias soon at work again. What |
hat may mean, of course, there
is no telling, for no details ar
rived up to the time of cabling.
At the same time it is impos- j
sible to say that Buller has good j
prospects of success. It has been
clearly proved that all the trump I
Â» 1
cards are in the hands of the;
j^ers. Not only are their troops
excellent shots, although it is re
ported that Buller s casualties in
the latest fighting were trifling:,
nut their positions are exceed- \
ingly well concealed and their!
communications and consequent
ly their movements are hidden
from the British view. They are
fighting with the prestige of sev
eral successes over the British.
On the other hand, say the mil
itary experts, it may be possible ;
to keep the Boers in uncertainty!
for a time as to the direction of j
the main attack, yet that direc- I
tion must be revealed before the j
full British strength can be ap
plied, owing to the nature of the |
country, rendering it necessary
for the British troops to cross the
low-lying ground within view of
the Boers on the adjoining hill
tops.
Once the object of the British
attack is made clear the superior
mobility of the Boers enables
them to concentrate rapidly'
against it a superiority of fire in

WASHINGTON. Feb. 10.â A resolution expressing sympathy with the Boers In their struggle against Great Britain
and urging mediation on the part of the United States between the belligerents was adopted by the Senate to-da.7 fci a
fit of temporary aberration of attention. The resolution was offered by Allen of Nebraska, and went through wtthmrj
attracting the slightest comment from any one of the dozen or more Senators present. A minute later, however, a; tha
request of the chair (Frye) Allen consented to a reconsideration of the 'vote by which the resolution was passed and
the Incident closed amid much quiet laughter.
Allen's resolution was as follows:
Besolved, That the United States of America extends its sympathy to thÂ© people of the South. African
republics. in their heroic straggle for liberty and popular government, and believes it to be the duty of tha
Government of the United States of America to offer mediation to the end that further bloodshed may "be
averted and an honorable peace may be concluded between the belligerent governments.
No objection was made to the consideration of the resolution, only about a dozen Senators befeyr present. Before
anybody realized what was going on the resolution was put to a vote and declared adopted. Senators looked from osa
to another and several, among them Allen, laughed unrestrainedly.
Pettus of Alabama, addressing the chair (Frye), demanded the* ayes and noes. To this Allen objected, as th* reso
lution had been declared adopted.

"Looking at : General Buller's action by

General McClellan, who, though cautious
and knowing -how to preserve his ; army,
hardly ever displayed the initiative power
to run risks or the self-reliance of a great
commander. To all appearances General
Buller has given up. his third attempt be
fore . his attack was fully developed.
"A telegram received this evening from
Lourenzo Marquez speaks of a sortie from
Ladysmith in tha night 'of Thursday: to

Buller's favor -by the force of
British cavalry regiments now in
Ladysmith. Putting aside alto
gether the fact that a great many
horses must have been killed by
Boer fire or died of disease the
military men say it is impossible
for White to co-operate with
; Buller until the latter is within
eight miles of Ladysmith. Even
then, unless the Boers are de
moralized to some extent, his ac
i tion would not be free from seri
j ous risks. It is now more clear
! than ever that Buller has a her
culean task before him.
The story that Mac Donald was
compelled to retire by order of
I Lord Methuen is now confirmed^
This causes even more disap
: pointment than Buller's troubles.
It was thought that Mac Donald
; was doing well, and in military
circles yesterday his retirement
was considered very galling.

Meanwhile the general develop
ments on the Modder River are
being watched with no little in
terest. Important events are ex
pected to take place within the
next week, for it is now quite
clear that it is Roberts' intention
first to deal with Cronje's army
of Boers at Magersfontein and
Jacobsdahl. With this object a
large force is being concentrated
rapidly at the Orange River sta
tion and in the camp at Modder
River.
There seems to be little doubt
that General French also* has
joined Methuen and assumed the

FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 10.â I
have only this to say: After
mature deliberation and con
ference -with my friends from
every section of the State, I have con
cluded to allow this controversy to take
its due course, vigorously contesting
every inch of ground and upholding
the rights of the people to the utter
most If those rights be destroyed
the responsibility for that destruction
must rest with those who sit in judg
ment. It is due to say that the emi
nent gentlemen, my friends, who se
cured the propositions resulting from
the Louisville conference, acted in
perfect good faith, from the highest
motives of patriotism, and did the
very best they could.
WILLIAM S. TAYLOB,
Governor of Kentucky.
The above proclamation was Issued by
Governor Taylor to-night and according
to hlB oral statement at the time of Its
issuance embodies all he desires to say
concerning his position at the present
time.
The decision not to sign the Louisville
agreement was reached by Governor Tay
lor a few minutes after 1 o'clock this aft
ernoon. For over two hours he had been
in conference with fully ISO prominent
Republicans from all parts of the State,
including county commltteemen and four
Republican members of the Legislature.
The meeting was secret in the extreme,
all those who came from the hall before
Governor Taylor himself refusing to say
anything concerning the progress of the
deliberations.
Judge Georgy Denny presided and L.
F. Petty acted as secretary. The mem
bers of the conference, with the excep
tion of Governor Taylor, gathered in the
legislative hall usually occupied by the
State House of Representatives. After
the hall was tilled Governor Taylor en
tered and was greeted with a ringing
burst of cheers. The door was then
closed and the secret proceedings began.
Governor Taylor stated to the confer
ence that there were two courses to be
pursuedâ first, to sign the Louisville
agreement, the second to quietly with
draw the troops, allow the Legislature
to reconvene In the Capitol building In
Frankfort, to call off the session now be
ing held In London and to ignore the Lou
isville agreement entirely. Several
speeches were made and It was soon ap
parent that, the sentiment of the gather
ing was strongly in favor of the second
course, and this was adopted. This ac
tion was decided upon at 1 o'clock 'and
the flrst Intimation of the decision was
given to the outside world by Governor
Taylor himself. He came rapidly through
the doors unattended and looking ner
vous and haggard. He walked hastily
hastily toward the Capitol stairway, re
peating several times to the newspaper
men who stood in the hall: "I don's sign,
I don't sign. I don't sign." From the
Capitol he passed to the executive build
ing, where he at once made up anJ
signed the following proclamation recon
vening the Legislature at Franklin:
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Feb. 10 âThe excitement
recently prevailing In this city having to some
extent subsided, and there appearing now to be
no necessity lor the General Assembly to re
main in session In London, I do hereby, by this
proclamation, reconvene the same In Frankfort,
Ky., on February 12, ISOO, at 12 o'clock noon.
W. S. TAYLOR,
. Governor of Kentucky.
Orders were at once issued to General
Collier to prepare for the departure of the
troops and In a very short time a large
number of them were ready to leave. Six
companies left to-night; more will leave
to-morrow and only a small detachment
will remain by Monday morning. These
will be retained only as a peaceguard and
will in no way be obtruded on the pres
ence of the Legislature. â¢ t
Word was at once sent to the members
of the Republican Legislature now in
session at London that the next session
would be In Frankfort, and a prompt re
ply was received to the effect that they
would all leave in a body on Sunday and
be in Frankfort Monday Jn ample time
for business. After Governor Taylor had
left the hall a resolution embodying the
sense of the meeting was adopted:
Resolved. That It is the sense of thU meeting
that Governor Taylor should not sign the agree
ment referred to him by the Louisville confer
ence, and that, reposing confidence in his abil
ity and sense of duty, we are content to follow
hlÂ» leadership after that refusal.
After the adjournment of. the meeting
It was the opinion of the Republicans that
the Gubernatorial contest was practically
over. They understand the action of to
day to mean, and it was intended to
mean, that the matter should now be
fought out before the courts, and the is
sue there reached to be accepted as final.
There was no intention of asking that a
new vote should be taken on the Goebel-
Taylor contest, but Governor Taylor
stated to several prominent Republicans
that he would ask that any former ac
tion be ratified by a vote of both houses,
taken coolly and without passion.
When informed of the action of the
Democratic Leglj'ature at Louisville In
refusing to come to Frankfort, Governor
Taylor said: "It strikes me that their
attitude is somewlat Inconsistent. They
claim they cannot be protected at Frank
fort, and there Is nobody here to molest
them. They objected to the presence of
troops at a time when there was far
greater excitement and danger than now.
After things have quieted down they re
fuse to return because they say they can
not be guaranteed protection.
The action of Governor Taylor to-day
returns the Gubernatorial nght to the ex
act position It occupied on the' day fol
lowing the Goebel assassination, with the
additional complication 'that there . was
but one Legislature and one Governor In
fact, whereas there are now two claim
ants for the position and two separate
bodies, each claiming to be the law-mak
ing power of Kentucky.
MEETINGS OF THE
RIVAL LEGISLATURES
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. Feb. 10.â The col
lapso of the peace negotiations through
Governor Taylor's rejection of the Louis
ville agreement and the latter's action In
calling off the London Legislature and
partially withdrawing the troops have
left the fight over State officers divested
of many of its warlike features, but In a
worse legal tangle than ever.
The receipt of the news from Frankfort
this afternoon was followed immediately
by a gathering of the Democratic leaders
at the Wlllard Hotel. At this conference
were Senator Blackburn, Governor Beck
ham, General Castleman. President Car
ter, of the Senate; Speaker Trimble and
others. At Its conclusion Governor Beck
ham sent to the Legislature a message,
reciting the faliure of the peace negotia
tions and the conditions existing at
Frankfort as seen by. him, and recom
mending that the Legislature continue its
sessions In Louisville, as he could not
guarantee their personal security nor pro
tect them from unwarranted Interference
at Frankfort. Acting upon this sugges
tion, the Legislature decided to remain in
Louisville ror the present, and both
houses adjourned to meet at the Court
house Monday at noon. It i 3 probable a
joint resolution, which was offered to
day, will then be adopted, calling for the
appointment of a committee to investi
gate the'condltlon at Frankfort as far as
they affect the safety of the legislators.
The members do not accept Governor
Taylor's action in ordering away part of
the troops as restoring order under which
they may return to the capital. They say
they would feel safer with the militia
there than with "the Irresponsible armed
mountaineers who for weeks have been
gathering about the State buildings" left
to menace them.
The Democratic Legislature held two
sessions to-day, with a quorum in each
house. At the first some minor legisla
tive business was disposed of. At the sec
ond Governor Beekham's message was
read. It follows:
Commonwealth of Kentucky, Executive Office.
Louisville, Ky.. February 10. 1900.
Gentlemen of the General Assembly: I de
fire to Inform you as to the result of the at
tempt to settle the present unfortunate btate of
affairs In the commonwealth by means of an
agreement made by a conference of representa
tives of both parties In this city last Monday
night. We earnestly hoped thnt by this agree
ment the differences before us would be re
moved, and thought peace and order would
again be established In the State. We have
been ready at all times that this matter should
be settled In conformity with that agreement.
But information has Just reached me that the
Republican claimant to the office of Governor
has refused to sign that agreement, and con
sequently all negotiations In that line are now
at an end. We had been led to believe that
the gentleman who now controls by armed
force the State departments at Frankfort
would abide by this agreement, and that your
body would again be permitted to meet In
its respective halls peaceably and unmolest
ed; but. having been disappointed In this hope,
I desire to recommend to you that you continue
your sessions for the present In the city of
Louisville, where every protection can bÂ« given
your members from any unlawful arrest or
other unwarranted Interference with your pro
ceedings. The Capitol buildings at Frankfort
are now In possession of armed forces openly
in defiance of law, held by those who have no
legal rights to do so, and for that reason I
could not guarantee to you that safety and
protection which you would need. If in session
there.
As the legally elected Governor of the com
monwealth of Kentucky. I promise to you to
use every legal means In my rower to restore
as soon as possible order and peace at thÂ«
State capital, that, a3 soon as you may deem
It advisable, you may adjourn your meetings
to that place.
AFking your assistance and co-operation to
bring about this result, I send this message to
you as a recommendation for your action at
present. J. C. W. BECKHAM,
Governor. -
Tho Senate at once adjourned until
Monday. In the House the following
joint resolution* was offered and went over
under the rules until Monday:
Whereas, One W. S. Taylor, who, without
right or legal authority and In defiance of peace
and good order, has for several days past sur
rounded himself and the public buildings at
the seat of government at Frankfort with
armed hordes of lawless, armed and organized
militia of the State and refused to permit the
General Assembly and Court of Appeals to
meet at their accustomed and t reg^ilar places of
sitting, has signified his purpose of ordering
the said militia now at the beat of govern
ment to retire from active service, without
indicating that he would take any ac
tion with reference to the armed men he has
gathered around him at the seat of govern
ment; now, be It therefore ' ; /jp1B&&Kl!MU
Resolved, By the General Assembly that a
committee of two from the Senate and three,
from the House be appointed, .which commit
tee Is hereby authorized to Investigate and re
port to the General Assembly whether it will
be possible nnd advisable for the Legislature
to resume Its sittings at Frankfort, and In the
meantime the said General Asenibly shall meet
at Louisville.
The House then adjourned until Monday.
LONDON, Ky.. Feb. 10.â The last session
of the Legislature In London was held to

SALISBURY USES COERCION
Fear of a Continental Protest the
Real Reason for the Proposed
Mobilization of tha
Navy. "ij"
Copyrighted. 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON. Feb. 10.â There exists to-day
what practically amounts to an offensive
and defensive alliance between Great Bri
tain and Portugal. For the past week and
longer there has been circulating through
the English press, irrespective of party
lines, a nervous apprehension of European
opposition and a still more nervous ap
preciation of the fact that the British
Government la unable to faca It with
honor to herself.
Constant editorials In the most unsensa
tional newspapers have at last developed
this phase of the agitation into a national
nightmare, which is not at all justified by
the tenor of the continental news publish
ed In the English papers. If the general
demand? for an immediate Increase In the
active naval and military strength, openly
urged to enable Great Britain to cope with
the.most aggressive movements that could
possibly be credited to Russia. France or
Germany, were only co-relative with the
extent to which Great Britain has been
drained in order to support her South
African war, these manifestations of the
press and consequent public anxiety would
easily be understood, but the clamor for
a great standing army and naval mobili
zation so much exceeds the comparatively
slight deficiency in the defensive poten
tiality caused by the war in South Africa
that ah impartial observer can scarcely
help coming to the conclusion that there
is more under the surface than news from
the Continent conveys, and after a care
ful investigation the Associated Press
leanus that this impression is quite cor
rect.
In the first place, much of this press
clamor for a tremendous armament in
order to meet unforseen emergencies Is
originally inspired with a view of com
pelling Parliament to pass quickly any
financial measures proposed by the Gov
ernment and to make them popular with
the people, who, through additional taxa
tion, may be called upon to add their
mites toward the stupendous plans now
pending to place the British Empire upon
a military eminence so supreme as. to be
beyond the fear of opposition. Lord Sal
isbury himself Is, perhaps, more inde
pendent and more regardless of news
paper influence and the aid of advertis
ing than any statesman of the day, yet
at this crisis he has not disdained to use
his immediate subordinates as direct
agents to fester among the leading Lon
don dailies public agitation, magnifying
the possibilities of foreign Interference
and minimizing the capabilities of home
defense. Russia's activity in China and
Persia and French and German antagon
ism are freely paraded before the nation
as an incentive to be up and arming, even
if it needs to be to the point of putting
into operation the militia ballot act.
which is almost synonymous with con
scription.
Yet the accounts of anti-British activ
ity all the world over, as dished up for
British readers, are not causing the For
eign Ofilce any serious anxiety, and they
do not Include the real reason for tho
tremendous military activity, which is &
determination to convince Portugal that
it Is advisable to meet Great Britain's
demands regarding the ports essential for
carrying on the Boer war, namely, Dela
goa Bay and Beiria, and. at the same
time, having secured Portugal's assent to
every proposition made, to be. In a posi
tion "to support that country . against a
united European opposition.
No word of this is printed or hinted at
her** but a representative of the Asso
ciated Press learns that intense pressure
is being brought to bear on Portugal by
continental powers to prevent her from
giving aid to the British. Portugal's Min
ister here, Senor Pinto de Soveral, i 3 al
most as much an Englishman as a Portu
guese, and his Gevernment Is only too
wilting to do everything, far beyond the
bounds of neutrality, to help Great Brit
ain protect Portugal. Lprd Salisbury Is
determined that this shall bo done and is
counting on the co-operation of his coun
trymen to put the nation on a footing to
defy Eurpean opposition. He has this
week taken definite measures regarding
the aforementioned ports that can only be
described as daring.
Portugal, bending to the modicum of
coercion and, convinced that Great Brit
ain Is able to uphold her, has acquiesced
until there practically exists to-day an al
liance of the strongest fiber between Great
Britain and Portugal. Yesterday, for rea
spr.s of diplomacy, nothing would be more
quickly otticially denied in London or Lis
bon, it is scarcely necessary to say that
all the foregoing Is gleaned from the high
est sources and is based upon unimpeach
able authority.
The abrogation of the Buller-Clayton
treaty Is the source of copious comment
in the weeklies. The Saturday Review ca
vils at Great Britain for "giving up
rights," maintaining that nothing will be
got from the United States in return, and
saying Great Britain's magnanimity will
be" mistaken by Congress for a desire to
avoid complications on account of the
troubles In South Africa.
"Because the Americans speak English,'"
adds the Saturday Review, "and the plu
tocracy of the United States Is united by
family ties with the directing class, aris
tocratic and otherwise, of Great Britain, is
no reason for ordering our affairs wltn
them on other than business principles."
The Speaker, on the other, hand, says:
"Certainly it is not in our interest to avail
ourselves of diplomatic technicalities in
order to prevent a result which is inevi
table."
Continuing, the Speaker supports Lcrd
Salisbury In declaring that the United
States intends to "forestall a European
descent upon South America, which fore
stalling Is not objectionable provided there
is no attempt to thrust American rule on
unwilling peoples and the doctrine of
equal trading rights is fully maintained."
All the papers unite in declaring Secre
tary Hay has secured a diplomatic tri
umph. '
Lord Balfour of Burlelgh. the Secretary
for Scotland, has Issued from the Scotch
Education Board a circular to the schools
calling attention to the importance of ele
mentary drill and advisins the formation
of school corps. This Is the first step to
ward adopting the system long in vogue in
the United States.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Most
Rev. Frederick Temple, D.D., will shortly

STRIKE IN BUILDING
TRADES ON IN CHICAGO
Workingmen Quit at Noon, and a
liong War Between Employers
and Employes Is Expected.
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.â Seven thousand
worklngmen who have been engaged on
buildings In course of construction here
quit work to-day.
This act, it is asserted, marks the real
beginning of a war between labor and the
contractors, which will suspend building
operations In Chicago for a period the end
of which no one sees.
The men are members of various unions
affiliated with the Building Trades' Coun
cil. Their rules, with the exception of
those of the Bricklayers' Union, provide
for a holiday every Saturday afternoon.
The ultimatum of the contractors recently
delivered does not allow of this, and in
consequence when the men quit work at
noon to-day, according to custom, the
contractors declared that the act consti
tuted a strike and announced that as fast
as possible non-union men would be se
cured to replace the strikers. Union lead
ers claim that they have not struck, but
have been locked out. They also assert
that the contractors cannot secure enough
men to continue their -work. Any at
tempts to replace the union men, they
say, will meet with- vigorous resistance.
Pickets have been stationed to meet in
coming trains to warn newcomers that
in working under contractors who are
parties to the lockout they are taking
long chances.
The Building Trades' Council has a mem
bership of 35,000 men. The contractors
have taken a stand against this force, re
fusing, they say, to longer submit to the
"arbitrary dictates of organized labor" in
fixing working hours and the amount of
work to be done in a day.
Trouble is feared by the authorities.
Policemen from outlying stations have
been called in to bo ready for Instant ac
tion.
The Industrial situation was complicated
further during the day by a notice which
was served on the proprietors of the
woodworking plants of the city by the of
ficers of the woodworkers' union warning
them that they must cease supplying ma
terial to contracting firms employing non
union labor or violating the Saturday half
holiday order. The union woodworkers
informed the manufacturers that material
must be refused to bosses who were an
tagonistic to tho unions, otherwise the
union workers would refuse to perform
work in the shops.

TS TERMS SATISFACTORY
UsÂ« of the Word "Alliance" in the
Hay-Pauncefote Convention the
Only Feature That Arouses
Objection in Paris.
Â»
Ceryrfrhted. 1300. by the Associated Pro**.
PARIS. Feb. JO.â ThÂ« Anglo-American
convention which permits American con
struction of the Nicaragruan canal has not
yet attracted the keen attention here
which its importance warrants, consider
ing the heavy French financial Interests
thereby affected. The Panama canal has
been a well In which nine French peasantb
out of every ten, attracted by specious
promises, invested some part of their
taxings wrung from French soil.
At the first glance the assured neutral
ity of the canal seems so satisfactory to
the political interests of France that the
Government's acquiescence appc-areU to be
a foregone conclusion. The Government
is rsot anxious at the present moment to
raise any obstacles which would estrange
the two countries and turn American sym
pathies toward England- -.
An official of the Foreign Office has au
thorized the following statement:
"Far from making any objection to the
Hay-Pauncefote convention, France hails
Â¦with the greatest satisfaction its prob
able ratification. Its terms coincide pre
cisely with those of th<* convention signed
by the powers at Constantinople in ISÂ£S,
legaxdlng the neutrality of the- Suez
canal, it was France that proposed those
terms. Though only theoretically in ef
lect now, they represent France's wishes,
if France is satisfied with the regulation
controlling a canal closely identified with
her interests, ehe cannot but be pleased
that, the sunie terms apply to a. canal in
a section of the world wnere her Interests
*ire not involved.
"Efforts to connect Panama interest*
with the convention will be futile, be
cause they are not involved, as the
treaty does not select a route, but only
opens the way for an American canal
across the isthmus, and does not desig
nate Its position. In no way <2oes it con
xilct with I'anama. "While individuals in
i-Yanco are deeply interested financially
in Panama, it is a private corporation,
;ir;d not a. Government concern. France's
consent to the iiay-Pauncefote conven
tion will be readily and willingly forth
coming." - j
The euggestlon that France ehall de
mand an indemnity for injury to the Pan
ama canal interests is scouted in unim
peachable circles. Such a demand, it la
pointed out, would have no legs to stand
on, according to international law, as the
construction of the Nicaragua canal
could only be regarded In the light of a
legitimate competition.
The word "alliance," as used in the
Hay-Pauncefote convention, naturally
has not pasted unnoticed in political cir
cles, but too great importance is not at
tached to it. Many politicians point out
that the United States Senate has not yet
ratified the Hay-Paunceftite agreement,
and the precarious position of the Franco-
American reciprocity treaty encourages
them in trie opinion that the introduction
cf the word â¢"alliance" may Jeopardize it.
However, there is no desire in
French political spheres to do aught to
lan the tlame of any Anglo-American en
tente, especially at a moment when
France's Interest might be better served
by adding to Great Britain's difficulties.
Great liritain'B status in Egypt, as af
fected by the revolt of the native troops.
Is treated here as extremely serious. This
new*, which was first anounced from
Cairo on January 21, has now become an
important feature in the French press
*md receives lull confirmation. Its sig
nificance will be realized when it is ex
plained that Egypt ib a tinder box, whence
a spark may set into flania the Anglo-
French animosity. The hope is freely ex
pressed in the French press that 'Eng
land's difficulty in overcoming the insur
rection may Justify tiia international re
opening of the Egyptian question, in
which * ranee could not remain a passive
spectator. The reported negotiations to
replace the English garrisons in Egypt
at the present Juncture with Italian troop*
is denounced here as contrary to the in
ternational agreement. The stories of
conferences between Lord Curries, the
British l^rr.bassador at Home, and Sir
Edmund Monson, British Embassador at
Paris, regarding this movement are ob
viously inventions, but Sir Edmund lion
son's departure to the Italian liiveria was
certJiinly due to the pique of the English
Government at the bitter anti-English
ft fling reflected everywhere here.
Officially Sir Edmund Monson has gone
south on account of his health, but it is
pointed out the climate on the French
KHiera is Just as good as that of the
Italian PJviera. and if health is the only
question the British Embassador could
have gone to Nice or Cannes and also
saved the $30 a day which he is now com
pelled to pay the British Charge d'Af
laires, according to diplomatic regula
tions, during his absence from the coun
try to which he Is accredited.
The Archbishop of Alx. Moneelgneur
Gouthe-Souiars, whose stipend was sus

determined to get into trouble. Ha has

"The violator of my country's laws " he
eaid, "is not I. but M. Waldeck-RousÂ«=eau
(the Prime Minister), by stealing my al
lowance, which is a debt recognized by
the concordat."
He proceeds to characterize M. Waldeck
liousseau's assertions as impudent lies
and a gross insult. The Government is
now urged to depose him altogether.
The celebrated Russian nihilist Peter

RAILROAD CENSURED.
An inquest was held yesterday on the
remains of James W. Reilly, a 2-year-old
boy. who was killed by a Southern Pacific
train near Sunnyside last Monday. The
Jury, after finding the cause of death,
severely censured the railroad company
for not maintaining proper fence guards
along its tracks. The testimony devel
oped the fact that in a densely populated
neighborhood the little child had crept
through the fence to the track, on which
it met death. The language of the verdict
is as follows: ;
We find accidental death occurred
in consequence of a passenger train of
the Southern Pacific Railroad running
over said child. We censure the said
Southern Pacific Railroad for not
maintaining a proper fence on both
sides : of its railway in the location
above ; described.
In the case of Mrs. Manuela Davalos,
who came to her death at her home, 1904
Mason street, last Monday, the Jury found
that an â¢ operation produced death, but in
the absence ; of - testimony was unable to
fix the responsibility. -
The Jury could not determine now the
body of Burton N. Hardiman, which was
picked lup near Angel Island, came to be
in the bay, and suicide was tho verdict In
the case of Gus Burchard.
Owing to a lack of testimony the Jury
waa - unable to state : who ; fired tho shot
which killed Â¦; Nicholas Schmid. This Is
supposed to be a case of suicide,
Fox were appointed a committee on per
manent organization. The committee on
platform is: Eli Wright, J. W. Ryland.
Judge J. R. Lewis, D. T. Bryant, Dr. Me-
Nary.
These committees are to report at a
meeting to be held on February 23. This
action by representative citizens i 3 a di
rect slap at the Rea Gang, which for so
long has dominated municipal affairs. The
officers to be elected are a Mayor. Treas
urer, City Clerk and Councilmen from the
Second and Third Wards.
It is practically a reform movement.
The choice for offices will be made at
a meeting on the 23d inst. and none but
those above reproach of any kind will be
indorsed. Harry J. Edwards will un
doubtedly be indorsed for Mayor. Soma
time ago Edwards announced himself as
an independent candidate for Mayor.
Since then hundreds of citizens hava
floclced to hi 3 support, and it is under
stood that the committee of one hundred
has asked him to be its candidate. Ed
wards' popularity and ?hia indorsement
will undoubtedly make him a sure winnet
in tho Mayoralty contest.
6j;TH POLICE PRECINCT,
GREATER NEW " YORK, Nov. 11, 1899.
RETRENCHMENT
ORDERED IN ALL
DEPARTMENTS
Supervisors Act on
Finances.
EXTRA CLERKS NOT ALLOWED
â¢ â .â. â
HEALTH BOARD TO GET THIRTT T
FIVE THOUSAND.
As the result of the final conference
held yesterday by the Mayor and the
Finance Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors, a report will be submitted at
to-morrow's meeting of the board regard
ing the retrenchment policy which has
been found imperatively necessary in or
der to make up a deficiency approximat
ing $140,000 in the city's finances and to
save the municipality from bankruptcy.
The conference was mainly directed to
the consideration of requests from heads
of departments for increased clerical ser
vice and consequent larger appropria
tions.
The Board of Health's request for $50,
000 for the six months ending June 30.
1900, will be denied, and that department
will have to get along the best way it
can with $35,000. The expenses of the City
Receiving Hospital and the insane deÂ»
tention ward are not included in this
amount, as they are specially provided
for. The appropriation for salaries of the
Health Department, which is now $8125
per month, will be reduced to $5925, thus
effecting a saving of $2200. In order 'to do
this it will be necessary to reduce the
present force as follows:
Assistant chemist, $100: bakery inspec
tor, $75; assistant plumbing inspector â
three at $23 per month, $75; emergency
surgeonsâ twelve, six alternating, $600;
one vaccinator, $100; four food inspectors,
$300; two market inspectors, $150; two
stewards. Emergency Hospital. $120; one
matron. Detention Hospital, $60; two ma
trons. Emergency Hospital, $120; alternat
ing inspectorsâ ten. $500; total, $2200.
The Street sweeping fund will also be
drawn upon to help the situation and a
saving of nearly $2500 per month will be
effected by reducing the number of days
when streets shall be Bwept from six to
five in one week. This is in accordance
with a recommendation of the Merchants'
Association, in order that the burden
would fail equally on the laborers.
The requests of Assessor Dodge for ten
clerks and that of County Clerk Deane
for eleven will be refused. The commit
tee visited the latter's office and contends
that the force at present employed there
is ample. The recommendation will be
made that the Police and Superior Court
clerks be assigned to office duty when
not otherwise employed, and that the
staff be kept steadily at work from 8:30
a. m. to 5 p.m.
The committee decided not to recom
mend two extra stenographers for , the
Police Courts. The suggeg...on is made,
that the Judges so arrange that two will
try all felony cases and two the misde
meanor cases, and in this way the two
stenographers will be sufficient. A sav
ing of $750 a month will be effected by in
creasing the number of nights when gas
lamps are not lighted from five to six.
The committee also decided to reject the
following salary demands from January
8 to 31. 1900, the positions not being pro^
vided for by the charter: Coroner's ma
tron. Mrs. Grace Harris. $44; experts. Su
pervisors' Committee, Barney Dougherty,
$110; expert to Personal <Â¦ Property Assess
ment Committee. A. G. Platt, $110; mes
senger. Hall of Records. John Patton. $55.
All the deficiency bills will be laid over
until there are sufficient funds in sight to
pay off the indebtedness. A request will
be sent to the Supreme Court that
an early decision be rendered on the
moneys collected on protested taxes
amounting to $151,000. If the city wins the
financial stringency will be relieved in a
great measure.
The committee will allow a mortgage
clerk in the Recorder's office, two clerks
in the Treasurer's office at $150 and $100
respectively, for the payment of rebates
on personal property taxes and collection
of fees, and four clerks for the Auditor
at $100 per month each. The demand of
J. W. Walton as poundkeeper has been
referred to the Supervisors' Police Com
mittee for settlement.

VISITED CHINATOWN.
Newhall Says the Highbinder Situa-

Commissioner Newhall, in company with
Acting Chief Blggy and Captain Wlttman,
visited Chinatown in the interest of the
department last night. Before leaving the
quarter, Newhall expressed himself to the
effect that excellent work had been done
in suppressing highbinder crime.
. Several banquets -were held in China
town last night, the most important hav
ing been given by the Ng Pong Tong, a
bianch of the Young Wo Society. By an
order of the police no women were per
mitted in the place, but about 400 Chinese
drank gin at. the Ng Pong affair. It was
given in honor of the anniversary of the
founding of the society.
Police Sergeant Donovan has decided
that all Chinese restaurants where liquor
is sold must pay license. He issued an
older to that effect and instructed the
proprietors to procure such license Mon
day morning. ,
The police are still on the lookout for
highbinders, expecting an outbreak of the
tong troubles. Houses where gambling
is conducted are still closed, and will be
so until the tong leaders sign the agree
ment proposed by Acting Chief Biggry.

SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 10.â John Bartini
and Joe Lafranchi, two Italian fisher
men, had a narrow escape from drowning
off Point San Pedro early this morning.
The two men were hauling in their
flounder nets when the accident occurred
which almost cost them their lives. The
men had hauled nearly forty fathoms of
net into the boat , when the . increased
weight apprised them of some unusually
large catch. Upon, raising the remainder
of the net into the craft a large male sea-,
lion made. its appearance entangled in the
meshes. Â¦" Â¦Â¦ . . ' ' Â¦
Although hampered, by the net the
beast was yet able to make his presence
interesting, and made for -his captors.
A blow with an oar failed to knock the
fur-bearer out, and only served to render
him doubly; furious. Open-mouthed
made a sort of clumsy leap at the men.

Special Dispatch to The Call
WOODLAND, Feb. 10.â For nearly a
year a number of residents of Yolo Coun
ty, living near the Sacramento River and
in the vicinity of Clarksburg, have been
making persistent efforts to get a free
ferry a mile and half north of Freeport.
The Yolo Supervisors have been willing to
grant the franchise and a part of the Sac
ramento Supervisors have been of the
same mind, but the owners of other fran
chises and several taxpayers have made a
stubborn fight against the proposition. By
a bare majority vote the Sacramento Su
pervisors have passed an order for a
franchise for the free ferry and accepted
the plans and specifications prepared by
the Yolo board, passed upon by the Dis
trict Attorneys of the two counties.
Conflict Between Authorities.
PORT DE FRANCE, Island of Martini
que, Feb. 10.â Senator Knight and ,the
Governor were present yesterday at the
Interment of the soldiers who were kilted
in the attack of the troops at Le Fran
cois. The presence of the Governor and
the speech made by the Mayor of Port da
France seems to indicate a conflict of
opinion between the civil and military au
thorities. There is a tendency on the part
of the administration to consider the riot
ing as only a strikers' outbreak. The riot
ing miners have been dispersed. Twelve
men were killed, five men were mortally
wounded and six were wounded less se
verely. The troops are still at the sceno
of the disorder. .

Regarding Wonderful Cures.

nue, Mount Vernon, N. Y.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I had been a sufferer for the past five years from severe
attacks of rheumatism and kidney trouble, probably con-
tracted by exposure on hunting expeditions and wading
streams." I tried many remedies, the patent and other kind,
but none of them seemed to do me any good. I was per-
suaded by an old and valued friend to try Swamp-Root,
and frankly confess that it has benefited me as no other
medicine has. I now feel like myself again. I do not have
the constant aches and pains which at one time seemed to
make life unbearable. It is a positive benefit in ailments of
this kind. I always keep it in the house, as it is just as ne-
cessary as bread and butter. . Very respectfully,
Qym^^^i^--^
EDITORIAL NOTE âWe are pleased to state that a special arrangement has been made by which all readers of our
paper may have a sample bottle, of the Great .Kidney Remedy, Swamp Root, sent absolutely free by mail. Be sure and mention read-
ing this generous offer in The Sunday Call when sending your address to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y.
How to Find Out if You
Need Swamp-Root.
It used to be considered that only uri-
nary and bladder troubles .were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs. .
The kidneys filter and purify the blood
â that is their work.
So when your kidneys are weak or
out of order, you can understand how
quickly your entire body is affected, and
how every organ seems to fail to do its
duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly," begin
taking the famous new discovery. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help
all the other organs to health.
Disordered kidneys are responsible for
more sickness and suffering than any
other disease. Kidney trouble irritates
the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless,
sleepless and irritable. Makes you pass
water often during the day and obliges
you to get up many times durinsr ths
night. Causes rheumatism and neural-
gia, pain or dull ache in the back, joints
and muscles, makes your head ache and
back ache, causes indigestion, stomach
and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yel-
low complexion: makes you . feel ns
though you had heart trouble: you have
plenty of ambition, but no strength, get
weak and waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the world-fa-
mous kidney remedy.
In taking Swamp-Root you afford na-
tural help to nature, for Swamp-Root is
the most perfect healer and gentle aid to
the kidneys that is known to medical
science.
If there is any doubt in your mind as
to your condition, take from your urine
on rising about four ounces, place it in
a glass or bottle, and let it stand twen-
ty-four hours. If. on examination, it is
milky or doudy, if there is a bricl*-dust
settling, or if small particles float about
in it, your kidneys are in need of imme-
diate attention.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and
is used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by skillful physicians in their
private practice, and is taken by doc-
tors themselves who have kidney ail-
ments, because they recognize in it the
greatest and most successful remedy for
kidney, liver and bladder troubles.
To prove its wonderful efficacy, send
your name and address to Dr. Kilmer
& Co., Binghamton, N. V.. mentioning
that you read this generous offer in the
San Francisco Sunday Call, when you
will receive immediately by mail free of
all charge^ a sample bottle of Swamp-
Root and a namphlet "of valuable infor-
mation pertaining to kidney and bladder
diseases. This book contains many of
the thousands upon thousands of testi-
monial letters received from men and
women cured. Swamp-Root is so re-
markably successful that those of our
readers who have not already tried it
are advised to write for a free sample
bottle, and to be sure and state that they
read this generous offer in the San
Francisco Sunday Call.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need you can
purchase the regular fifty-cent and one
dollar size bottles at the druz stores.
His Own Physician Ordered It.
New fork, Nov. 17, 1899.
To Whom It May Concern :
I was all run down in health and spirits, from overwork on
the Exchange floor. I developed nervous neuralgia and also
suffered from an acute attack of rheumatism.
Of course, I had careful medical attendance, but while con-
valescing my own physician himself ordered me to take Swamp-
Root to build up my nervous system, and put my kidneys in shape.
It helped me more than any curative or tonic I ever used and
now I always keep it in my medicine chest. With best wishes
for sufferers.

motion and ordered the removal of the
defendant.
Molineux shook hands with his father
and his brother, Leslie, and started to fol
low the Deputy Sheriff to the prison. As
he left his seat General Molineux said to
him, in tones loud enough to.be heard by
all:
"Keep up your nerve."
The prisoner replied with a smile: "Yes;
don't be afraid."
Molineux's mother and wife, unable to
bear the strain of long waiting for the
verdict, had left the courtroom soon after
the jury went out.
Mr. Weeks asked, on behalf of General
Molineux, that the latter be permitted to
visit his son, and the Recorder made an
exception in this case and granted per
mission.
Foreman Martin said the jurors had
agreed among themselves to absolutely
refrain from the discussion of any of the
proceedings in the jury-room.
A tremendous crowd waited in the cor
ridors of the courtroom and about the
building until after the return of the ver
dict, and. when Molineux was brought out
by the Deputy Sheriff. somebody called for
"Three cheers for Molineux," and a re
markable demonstration, with great
cheering, followed. The announcement of
the verdict of guilty was received in the
uptown districts and about the clubs ap
parently with great surprise. Many of
the club men seemed to be staggered by
the announcement, and it was the main
topic for discussion for the night.
It is said the trial has cost $200,000.
STORY OF THE CRIMES
CHARGED TO MOLINEUX
Henry C. Barnet and Mrs. Kate J.
Adams the Victims of the
Poisoner.
Roland B. Molineux was at one time a
prominent member of the Knickerbocker
Athletic Club of New York. - He was one
of the best amateur horizontal bar gym
nasts in thÂ» country. At some of the pub
lic club exhibitions he appeared in pink
tights with rouged cheeks. He was
aesthete. By profession he was a color
mixerâ a sort of chemistâ and wax the
superintendent of a color factory in New
ark. His father, General E. L. Molineux,
also belonged to the Knickerbocker Ath
letic Club. The son studied chemistry at
the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.
Soon after Henry S. Cornish became the
athletic director of the Knickerbocker
Athletic Club he and Roland B. Mollneux
fell out. Their quarrel was a violent one.
Cornish called Malineux a vile name, so
Molineux has sworn, and early In 1838
young Molineux withdrew from the
Knickerbocker and Joined the New York
Athletic Club. The feud between Cornish
and Molineux continued and both clubs
were drawn into the controversy. Letters
on the subject passed between the govern
ing bodies of the two clubs.
On October 27, IS3B, Henry Crossman
Barnet, a member of the Knickerbocker
Athletic Club, received at the club what
was ostensibly a sample bottle of Kutnow
powder. He took some of its contents and
fell sick." Dr. H. Beaman Douglass was
called and said Barnet had diphtheria.
During his illness he^was attended by two
professional nursesâ Miss Jennie Callender
and Miss Addie Bates.
On November 10. 1898. Barnet died in his
room at the Knickerbocker Athletic Club.
The physician's certificate said the cause
of death was diphtheria and heart failure.
Among Barnet's effects was a bundle of
love letters from Blanche Chesebrough.
On November 22, 1895. twelve days after
Barnet's death, Blanche Chesebrough
and Roland B. Molineux were married
and went to live with Mrs. Alice Bellin
ger at 257 West End avenue. Miss Chese
brough boarded at the Bellinger house for
.several years before her marriage. She
had been a church choir singer.
On December 23 or December 24, IS9B,
Henry S. Cornish received at his desk at
the Knickerbocker Athletic Club a mailed
package which contained a bromo seltzer
bottle in a silver holder. Cornish threw
the wrapper into the waste basket and
took the package home with him to the
flat of his aunt, Mrs. Kate J. Adams, -61
West Eighty-sixth street, where he
boarded.
On December 2S, 1838, Mrs. Adams took
some of the contents of the alleged bromo
eeltzer bottle and died almost instantly.
Cornish tasted the dregs in the glass and
was prostrated. Dr. Edward F. Hitch
cock smelled the <lrÂ«gs and was made ill.
The contents of the bottle sent to Bar
net were then analyzed by Professor R.
A. Witthaus and were found to contain
cyanide of mercury. The contents of the
bottle sent to Cornish were analyzed and
found to contain cyanide of potassium.
On January 2, ISM, after his name had
been freely connected with the mystery,
Roland B. Molineux called on Captain
McClusky, chief of detectives, and offered
himself for arrest. He was then told that
he was not wanted. Subsequently he was
arrested, charged with the murder of Mrs.
Adams by sending poison through the
mails.
ROLAND B. MOLINEUX.
NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â After deliber
ating seven and a half hours, the
jury returned a verdict of guilty
of murder in the first degree
against Roland B. Molineux,
charged with the murder of
Mrs. Katherlne J. Adams, by poison,
on December 2S, 1595. Barlow S. Weeks,
counsel for the defense, made the usual
motion, and Recorder Goff adjourned
court until February 16, when, he said, he
Â¦would hear the motion and sentence the
defendant.
From the time the jury went out at 3:15
p. in. the crowd in the courtroom watched
the door through which It had left the
court In silent expectancy. It was al
most two hours before there was any
noise. The solemnity of the occasion had
affected court officers and visitors alike.
The jury came in shortly after 9 o'clock
to ask for exhibits of handwriting and
again at 10:30 it came in for instructions.
Kifteen minutes later there was no doubt
that the jury had agreed. Court officers
shouted for silence. Doors were locked
and the gray-haired clerk of the court
took his seat below the Recorder's bench.
General Molineux sat straight In his
chair, a plassy look in hie eyes and his
hands folded on the table in front of him,
trembling: a little In spite of himself.
Then there was a hush. The jurors
Â¦walked to their chairs between a double
file of court officials. There was no sign
of chffcr in any of their faces. As soon
ss they had taken their seats a Deputy
Sheriff brought Molineux from thf- prison.
There was no sigrn of apprehension on
the younp man's face. His step was light
and springy and he smiled as if he had not
a care in the world. Then he sat down,
looked for a moment straJpht at the Re
corder's bench and then whispered to Mr.
Week?, who was showing siena of nerv
ousnes?. A moment later the Recorder
entered. The names of the jurors were
read and the clerk said:
"Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed
i;pon a verdict?"
â¢'WÂ» have." replied the foreman.
"The jurors will please arise. The de
fendant will arise."
General Molineux sat with his hands
clasjx-d In front of him on the table. His
fac* never flinched as the clerk asked
Â¦gain:
"What is your verdict?"
"We find the defendant guilty of murder
in the first degree."
As the words were spoken the bell In
th<Â» ftrehouse near by struck 11 o'clock.
It sounded like the tolling of a church bell
for the dead. Molineux. hardly moved.
His neck stiffened a little and he straight
ened his back. General Molineux reached
his hand to his son's shoulder and pressed
it bard. Mollneux put his own hand on
1:1s father's shoulder and stood without
further movement while his counsel asked
that the Jury be polled.
Each juror agreed with the verdict ren
<sÂ«>red by the foreman, and then the Re
corder asked if counsel had any request
to make. Recorder Goff heard the formal

GENTLEMEN:
In justice to you, I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the
sample bottle of Swamp Root you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five
years with kidney and bladder trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would re-
lieve me for the time being, but the old complaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a
sample bottle of Swamp Root, and I found it did me a world of good. Since then I have taken
eight small bottles bought at my drugstore, and I consider myself perfectly cured. I do not have to
get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did, three or four times a night, but now sleep the
sleep of peace. My back is all right again and in every way lam a new man. Two of my brother
officers are still using Swamp Root. They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise of it. It is a
boon to mankind. We recommend it to all humanity who are suffering from kidney and bladder
diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter) as well as myself thank you
for the blessing you have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp Root. We re-
main, yours very truly, JAMES COOK,
Officers of the 65th Police Precinct, Greater New York. HUGH E. BOYLE,
Received your sample bottle of Swamp Root which you were good enough to send me. It
'helped me wonderfully. Have since taken two bottles purchased from my druggist. It seemed as
if my back would break in two when I got up after stooping. lam now entirely cured, and cheer-
fully recommend your "Â¦medicine to anyone suffering from kidney disease.

| Dr. Mclaughlin's Electric Belt,
I Which has a Special Electric Suspensory for Weak Men. This is guaranteed the
H strongest and best Electric Belt in the World. It does not barn nor blister. â¢^''tifijX^!?****^^
Jjjjj 1 HAVE INVÂ£> TED and perfected* a wonderful Electric Belt for
Â¦ the cureof those failings in men. It is made with one special object â
SI to renew the vital power in weak parts, and it does this as nothing else
g can do it, because it is applied right. I have spent twenty years in
Q perfecting my appliance and learning how to adapt it to these weak-
** nesses of men, and I say honestly that it will not fail when my advice
S is followed.
Â«j No matter what you have tried, whether in the line of medicine or
B electricity, I can cure you.
Â¦ IS iTANY ARGUMENT against my Belt that medicine, which con-
H tains no vital tonic properties, has not cured you? how can it give you
which it has not? Is it any argument against my belt that

rj lessness, Constipation, and all troubles in Men or Women resulting Irom a Loss of the Vitality which the body ought to possess.
M FORrEACh OF THESE troubles* I have a special "method" or
B style of treatment. I know what each demands, just how the electric
S current must be applied, and, as I give personal attention to every
H case, I am able to direct just how to use my Belt so as to get the best
Â¦ results
Sj SPECIALâ I sell my Belt at HALF PRICE to thos; disappointed
5 with the old style, burning belts. , . ;Â£Sv^i
crude, blistering, out-of-date electric belt, applied without sense or
consideration of your trouble, has not cured you? I hope not.
THE HUMAN BODY is a very delicate piece of machinery. It must
be treated gently and intelligently when it is beginning to break down,
nosing the sensitive stomach with drugs wiil not restore strength to
weak organs Even if the drugs had strength to give, they never
reach the parts that need the strength.
EVERYBODY KNoWS that * lectricity is the basis of vitality.
Therefore, use Electricity, tut use it right. This is my specialty. I
know better than any other man on earth how to use it in these special
troubles, because 1 have had the benefit of twenty years of close
study and actual personal contact with over 50.000 cases treated
with it ! I have had the benefit of the experience and theories of the
greatest scientists.
IT IS FPOM THIS that I have brought forth my present "Dr. Mc-
laughlin's Method." which is curing supposedly Incurable cases. I
care not what has failed to cure you, take my word for it, you are not
incurable until my method has failed to cure you.
MY HLtCTRIC BELT is as different, is as far superior, to others
which are claimed to be the best made as a silver dollar is superior to
a lead one. Talk will not prove this, but comparison of mechanical
construction and results of use will prove it.

. PETALUMA, Feb. 10.â A sugar refinery,
which will employ 700 hands and a plant
representing a million and a half dollars,
is one of the probabilities of this city In
the near future. A definite proposition has
been made to the farmers of this vicinity
relative to the use of land adapted to the
production of the sugar beet, for the use
of which ?6 an acre Is offered. The So
noma Water Company has promised to
supply half a million gallons of water

RECIPROCITY TREATIES
DOOMED TO DEFEAT

First to Fail in the American
Senate.
Special XHspatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â By their pol
icy of non-action Republican Senators
have defeated the first of the administra
tion reciprocity treaties just as effectively
as If it had been rejected by a direct vote
of the Senate. This happened to-day
when the treaty with the Argentine Re
public by Its own provision falls to the
ground. This treaty was signed on July
10 last and required that ratifications
should be exchanged within seven months.
This time limit expired .to-day. The
treaty therefore cannot be revived with
out new negotiations, and these will not
be attempted, for It is well understood
that the wool growing Interests of this
country will not permit ratification of the
treaty by the Senate. Tho same fate is
in store for all the rest of the reciprocity
treaties.

REGISTRATION FUNDS
SHORT IN SAN JOSE
City Officials Are Unable to Prepare
for the Coming
Election.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 7.â The city officials
are vexed with the problem of register
ing all the voters of the city for the com
ing city election, which occurs on May 21.
There are no available funds In the hands
of the city for the work and in the short
time intervening the clerical foree 1 - of the
County Clerk is not sufficient to do the
work. The new registration law adopted
by the last Legislature canceled all the
registrations on January 1, and according
to it new registers must be made up for
each precinct. ' The law provides that
each voter' must be registered forty days
before election, and this leaves but fifty
four days to complete registration for the
city election.
At present the registrations are pro
ceeding at the rate of eight to ten a
day, and in order to register voters of
San Jose It will be necessary to serve
from eighty to 100 a day. This will be
Impossible with the present force of the
County Clerk. To accomplish this would
cost the city several thousand dollars,-- if
It can be done, but the city has not tha
money to expend. As it is, there will be
a serious deficiency in the city treasury
at the end of the fiscal year, and to meet
it the salaries of nearly all city officials
will have to be docked for June. As a
way out of the dilemma of registration,
an attempt will probably be made to use
the old registers, although they have been
canceled by law. Again the legality of
the election if the old registers are used
may be questioned by the defeated can
didates, and city officials are now in a
quandary.
NEW HEAD CLERK OF
WOODMEN OF THE WORLD
OAKLAND, Feb. 10.â I. I. Boak, camp
clerk of Oakland Camp No. 94, Woodmen
of 4he World, has been appointed head
clerk of the order for the entire country,
taking the place of General J. W. Brown-
Ing, resigned. This is a great honor for
Oakland Camp that of all the hundreds
of camps and thousands of members the
selection should be made from Oakland
and the camp appreciates that fact.
Oakland Camp appointed a committee
to give Mr. Boak a reception before ills
departure. H. J. McKim was the head
of this committee and W. L. Boldt sec
retary, and the date Â¦ of the event has
been set for Monday evening next at the
camp's headquarters.
Mr. Boak has long. been connected with
the Woodmen of the World.. He was one
of the early members and came to Cali
fornia In the interests of the order nearly
ten years ago as organizer. It is largely
due to his efforts that the order has at
tained the prominence it has on this
coast. Mr. Boak men determined to set
tle In Oakland and he formed a partner
ship with Thomas M. Robinson and since
tnat time he has taken .an important part
in the business and political affairs ol
Oakland. He has filled nearly all the
offices in Woodcraft from a simple mem
ber to organizer, camp clerk of Oakland

PACKERS JOIN GROWERS.
Convention Ratifies Contract With
the Association.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â The packers of the
State, In convention assembled in this
city, to-day, ratified,' confirmed and adopt
ed in all its details the contract between
the packers and the California Cured
I'^uit Association pertaining to prunes.
The contract covering other deciduous
fruits contemplated to be handled by the
association having been agreed* to in all
Its outlines, was referred to a special
committee to arrange it in detail. This
is in conformity" with the action taken
regarding the prune contract.
The action of the convention to-day re
moves any doubt which may have existed
that the growers and the packers would
not join In making the organization a
grand success. From now on all inter
ests are expected to work in harmony,
the -packers having passed a resolution
advising all packers to sign the. contract,
and all growers to become members of
the association.
Pleads Insanity.
STOCKTON. Feb. 10.â The defense In
the case of W. J. Goldsworthy, the mer
chant on trial for burglary, is insanity.
Goldsworthy was caught one night a few
months ago in the basement of a store ad
joining his with a pile of inflammable Btuft
ready for ignition, and the supports of the
flooring removed to make sure of a quick
drop of the floor and Its weight of liquors.
The prosecution closed this morning, and
tho defense announced insanity and
brought forward testimony to that end.
It was shown that Goldsworthy could not
profit by the insurance on his store if the
lire had been started, and his socialistic

Montana State Senator's
Testimony.
TELLS OF A CONVERSATION
â¢ I 4
ALLEGED CONFESSION OF THE
FOE OF CLABK.
Said to Have Remarked That He
Could Get More Money by Going
Over to the Opposi
tion.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10.â State Senator
Tierney of Montana continued 'his testi
mony in the Clark case before the Senate
Committee on Privileges and elections to
day. He said he had never been asked to
support Clark for the Senate and was
never offered any consideration for bis
vote for that gentleman. The details of
tho organization of the Townsend Bank,
In which ho had money, wero explained.
Tierney said that the $5800 which he
had put into the organization of the new
bank at Townsend had been kept in the
safe of Darcey & Co., where it had been
put In preference to putting: it into tho
bank of Hyatt & Delanty, the only bank
then existing in Townsend. Of the JSSOO
drawn out In this transaction not to ex
ceed $2000 had been entered upon the
books of the firm. He had taken It out be
cause it was his. Very often, however,
these deposits were put into the general
cash fund of the firm.
In response to a question from Senator
Chandler the witness said that notwith
standing he knew there were aspersions
cast upon his character because of his
vote for Clark, he had brought no paper
of any kind to Washington with him to
show where the $5800 used in organizing
the Townsend Bank had come from. The
questioning brought out the fact that
both Eversoll and Representative Sheve
lin, who, together with Tierney, consti- i
tuted the whole legislative delegation j
from Broadwater County, were stock
holders in the town's second bank. Of the
entire $25,000 capital Tierney said that
himself and relatives and business asso
ciates had contributed about $IS,OOO,
Messrs. Eversoll and Shevelin each sup
plying $1000. The concern had been can
vassed two years previous to the time of
its actual organization, but the idea had
not been put into execution because of
the difficulty of getting the money to
gether. Some of the money put in by his
relatives had been brought from the East.
All the members of the Legislature who
were in the bank in the end voted for
Clark for the Senate.
William Berne, a ranchman of Colum
bia Falls, who said he had formerly
worked In one of Daly's mines at Butte,
testified to having been sent by men con
nected with Daly to Flathead County
during the legislative election of IS9S to
assist Whlteside in his race for the State
Senate. On the train out from Columbia
Falls, he said, he had a talk with White
side and the latter told him that Senator
Clark had sent money into the county to
be used against him, adding that he
would get even with Clark if It ever came
In his way for "bucking him" in his elec
tion. Whiteside had said he would "job
Clark to a fare you well." Again, in
Helena, after the Legislature met, he
asked Whiteside for some money.
"Whiteside replied," said the witness,
"that he had only $7, though a few weeks
before he had $30,000 in his pockets, but
that as it had not been his he turned it
over to the State. He said he had been
offered $100,000 to leave the town. I told
him," continued the witness, "that he was
a dâ d fool for not keeping the money,
but he replied that he could make more
out of the other side â out of Daly â by
turning the money over."
On cross-examination the witness said
he had thought that Whlteslda had meant
that he could not only get tha $100,000 for
leaving, but he could also keep the $30,
000. He added that Whiteside had loaned
him $5 of the $7 he had on hand, and that
he had paid the amount back.
SAN FRANCISCO WILL
NOT GET THE FIGHT
Corbett and Jeffries to Battle
at Coney Island, Probably
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAM C. AUSTIN, Who Will Officiate at Big Fight.
SAM C. AUSTIN, who has been chosen to referee the Corbett- Jeffries
fight, which is to be held in May, is famous throughout
this country and England as a sporting authority. For the past ten
years he has acted as sporting editor of an Eastern weekly. Mr. Aus
tin is competent to act as referee, having on numerous occasions officiated
in that capacity to the entire satisfaction of the principals and the public.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â There is a strong
probability that the heavy-weight cham
pionship battle between Corbett and Jef
fries, now scheduled to take place In San
Francisco on April 10, will be held at
Coney Island on May 14. Negotiations to
ward that end are now pending between
the principals and the managers of the
Seaside Athletic Club. The only hitch in
regard to a change of the battle ground
Is about the date. The Seaside Athletic
Club ofllcials want the contest to take
place on April 10. while William A. Brady.
Jeffries' manager, Insists upon the selec
tion of May 14, and there the matter rests.
Brady's objection to April 10 is the in
ability of the" Coney Island organization
to furnish proper heating apparatus In
case the weather should be cold. He fa
vors May 14 not only on account of the
desirable conditions that are apt to i. re
vail at that time but because tha racing
season here will then be on, and as all the
well known horsemen are patrons of the
prize ling the gate receipts are sure to be
larger. Unless the Seaside Club agrees
to accept May 14 as the date of the battle,
Brady says, the bout will be held on April
10, as originally planned.
It Is quite probable that the Coney Isl
and organization will concede the right of
the champion to name the date and tho
men will battle in the . .Seaside Club's
arena.- >j-^ ;Va S& Â¦ ' \ .**'
If Corbett and Jeffries agree to fight at
Coney Island they will receive 60 per cent
of the gross receipts, which is 15 por cent
less than the National Athletic Club of
San Francisco offered. Corbett, when in
formed that tho contest would likely take
place at Coney Island, said that he was
glad to hear It.
"Jeffries and I," said. Corbett, "can
make more money fighting here for 60 per
cent of the receipts than we could bat
tling for 75 per cent in San Francisco. I
guess the dispute over the date will be
settled satisfactorily."
As soon as the date of the battle Is
selected Corbett says he will go to Lake
wood and again begin training.
While the real reason for the switch
from San Francisco to Coney Island la
kept In the background, the technical
cause announced was that the National
Athletic Club of San Francisco failed to
deposit the $5000 forfeit with a New York
stakeholder within the required time. Ac
cording to the agreement Al Smith was to
hold the forfeit money of all parties. Ho
notified Messrs. Considine and Brady to
day that he had not received any money
from the National Athletic Club. A tele
gram was shown stating that the money
had been deposited with a San Francisco
newspaper, but Considine .would not hear
to this. He said that the match would be
oft unless some other arrangement could
be made.
It is announced that Sam Austin will
be the refereee.

TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 10.â Mrs. Louise
Eoyce, a cashier in Shuh & Rider's "Do

three times before 6 o'clock to-night, and
died shortly after being taken to the hos
pital. The couple came to Tacoma a week
ago from Seattle. Prior to that they re
sided in "San Francisco.
Entering the restaurant, BoycÂ© drew a
self -cocking revolver from his coat pocket
and began firing.' The first shot appar
ently struck the woman In the arm. With
a cry of terror she started to escape and
ran Into a small private dining-room a
few steps from her desk. As she darted
forward Boyca fired another shot, which
struck her In the chest, penetrating the
lungs. The woman threw up her hands
and fell backward to the floor.
At that Instant Boyce fired two morÂ«
shots at her, neither of which took effect.
Then hÂ© deliberately bent over the pros
trate body and fired a shot into her chest.
Bovce offered no resistance when ar
rested. Calmly he handed the revolver to
a policeman, saying as he did so: "I had
to kill her. She blabbed too much. . I
shot her.". â¢ .
Bovce served as principal musician In
the Fourteenth United States Infantry
and went to the Philippines with that
regiment. He was discharged in Manila,
he claims, at the expiration of his ser
vices, receiving $600 back pay. He shipped
for San Francisco a few months ago and
got on a big drunk there. When he came
to his senses he says he discovered that
he was a married man. In his stories
Boyce also stated that the woman had
Ereviously been married to a Frenchman,
y whom she had two children.
Mrs. Boyce's mother. Mrs. Caroline
Bock, is now living at Peorla, 111., and she
has a sister in San Francisco.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 10.â Following the
attacks which have appeared recently in
a San Francisco newspaper upon the
State Printing Office, the representatives

Union and Bookbinders' Union publish a
statement in which they protest against
comparing their labor and rate of wages
with those of students in the State Uni

public exr-ense.
This rcicrence arises from the plea of
the regpnte of the State University that
it would cost too much to have the re

State, and that they want them done by
the Ftuder.ts. These caustic remarks oc

Suicide of a Veteran.
NAPA. Feb. I').â William Nelson killed
himself at the- Veterans' Home, 'this
tween the Supervisors of Yolo and So
lano counties, due in a measure to the
desire of a large number of taxpayers to
secede from Solano and be annexed tc
Yolo. Another source of contention haa
been the necessity for and the number
of bridges that should be constructed over
Putah Creek, which is the dividing line
between the two counties. After wrang
ling for a long time, tho two boards got
together about two months ago and
signed an agreement to construct two
bridges, one this year and the other In
1901, the expense to be borne equally by
the two counties. The agreement was
duly drawn and signed by the Yolo board
and forwarded to Solano County for the
signatures of that board. After waiting
nearly two months, the Yolo Supervisors
officially requested the Solano Supervisors
to take some action.
Now comes the news that the District
Attorney of Sotano County holds that tho
agreement 13 not valid. The whole pro
ceeding Indicates that the Solano Super
visors are trying to find a pretext for re
pudiating; the agreement. The bridges
are an urgent necessity and the Yolo
board will at once take steps to construct
one of them at the expense of this county
unless the Solano County authorities taks
action soon, indicating an intention to
comply with the terms of the agreement.
So far Tolo County people have taken no
part In the agitation of the proposition
to annex a part of Solano County to Yolo
but the dilatory action of the Solano Su
pervisors has aroused a strong sentiment
in favor of annexation as the only hops
of securing the bridges.

CONVICTS ABE
REFUSED PAROLES
Action of the State
Prison Directors.
Â»
SYSTEM IS UNSATISFACTORY
APPLICATIONS FOB RESTORA
TION OF CREDITS DENIED.
Warden Aguirre Beports That There
Are More Orders for Grain
Bags Than Can Be
Filled.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Feb." 10.â The
Staxo Board of Prison Directors held its
regular meeting here to-day. The prin
cipal matter to occupy the board's at
tention during the morning session was
the consideration of claims for the res
toration of credits and the granting of
paroles. The following convicts made ap
plication to the board to have their lost
credits restored: William Miner, who had
served thirty years tor stage-robbery and
had lost Eix years nine months credits,
lie has still three years to serve. Four
and a half years of his credits were re
stored. Charles Manning lost all credits
In is*). Manning, who is serving seven
teen years for a robbery committed in
Mendocino County, attempted to escape
in that year and was oniy recaptured
after he had shot an arm off one of the
guards sent to recapture him. Manning
lest six years and nve months credits for
his attempt at escape, of which he has
served three months. After taking into
consideration the small percentage Man
ning had served, the board denied his
petition. Frank Kennedy, who lost one
year's credits for smuggling opium and
has served live months of these, asked
that the rest lie pardoned. His petition
was denied. The board also denied the
petitions of Richard Cnristopher, who
lost six months' credits in I^3 tor having
opium and money in his possession, and of
Eugene Callahan. who lost two months
credits for attacking a. fellow-prisoner
with a knife.
As William Howard and Fred Coleman
had not yet begun to serve their forfeited
credits the board decided to await action
until that time, as was also done in the
case of William Ixing. Howard is the in
ventive genius through whose ingenuity
the jutemill machinery has been often im
proved and repaired. He lost eight
months' credits on a term of seven years
for burglary. His offense was scandalous
conduct. If Fred Coleman's petition is
granted he will be able to celebrate the
Fourth in citizen's clothes, for on that
day his ten-year sentence tor grand lar
ceny would expire were it not for the fact
that he has lost three months' credits.
William L<ons lost four years and seven
months credits four years ago for opium
pmugjrling. He is serving nine years for
burglary from San Dieeo.
There were three applicants for paroles
âJames Baker. M. A. Mayes and Wilson
E. Cramer. Baker's case is a peculiar
one. He was arrested at Fresno at the
time of the Sonr.tag and Evans excite
ment. He was caught taking an old set of
mule harness valued at S3 out of a barn.
He received a sentence of seven years.
Of this hfc has two years and six
months tn serve. Although Captain Ed
gar and Warden Aguirre testified to Ba
ker's exemplary conduct the board re
fused to parole, him. M. A. Mayes. serv
ing fix years for grand larceny from Los
Ar.pcles! and who has nine months to
Â«rye. was also refused a parole, as was

The studies will include papers on cameras, lenses,
dry plates and films, the dark room, negatives, re
touching, printing, photographic papers, flashlights,
outdoor and indoor pictures, and general papers on

Caroline Herschel. Sarah Kemble Siddons, Madame
Le Brun, Mary Lamb, Charlotte Corday, Jane Aus
ten. Elizabeth Fry, Harriet Martineau, Margaret
Fuller, Charlotte Cushman. Jenny Lind, Rosa Bon

It will be seen the studies of the term are to cover
a wide variety of subjects and that most of them are
pertinent to the season. Each article is to be the
work of an expert, and will be valuable to students as
well as interesting to casual readers.

THE BRITISH PROBLEM.
GLADSTONE was not a military man. His
training for and experience in public life
were in statesmanship and not in military tac
tics. But he was a many sided man in his attain
ments. None knew better than he the relations ,of
military prestige to the primacy of a nation, and per
haps few commanders knew better the risks and gains
of war, or weighed possible advantage against prob
able defeat more accurately. After Majuba Hill he
made the last treaty with the Boers, which ended the
forward movement of Great Britain upon their ter
ritory. For that treaty he was bitterly denounced.
The English jingo element called him a coward, and
in military circles the unavenged disaster to British
arms has rankled ever since. During her jubilee
parade the Queen was often saluted by the cry from
the miliions of her onlooking subjects, "Ma'am, give
us a whack at old Kruger."
What the British public wanted it has. The whack
at old Kruger has been going on for months, and so
far no British soldier has set foot on Boer territory
except as a prisoner of .war. The best commanders
and strategists in the British military establishment
have gone to the front, have led their troops in per
son and have bÂ«en defeated. The imperial force in
the campaign far exceeds that of the Boers, but there
seems to be, in a military sense, some equalizing in
fluence that was not reckoned with by Rhodes and
Chamberlain. It is not in any lack of courage among
the British officers and men, for they have failed in
nothing that should win victory. The slaughter of gal
lant officers has been pitiful. They have fought and
fallen on every field, splendidly reckless of personal
safety, and mindful only that England expects them to
do their duty, and they do it like brave gentlemen. One
must not hope, then, to find the cause of multiplied
disaster in any lack of soldierly qualities in Tommy
Atkins or his officers. The equipment of the Brit
ish columns is as perfect as science, experience and
money can make it. So far no external circum
stances in the form of international aggression have in
any way interfered. Yet disaster follows disaster.
The Boers make no sally from their positions. They
wait grimly for the attack and turn it with every in
cident of slaughter and humiliation.
It is time for England to examine Gladstone's mo
tives and seek for their basis. He knew thorough^
the dependence of the empire upon British military
prestige, and he knew that if that prestige were risked
and lost in a petty war uproar would replace author
ity and order throughout the conquests of England.
Is it not probable that he knew accurately the
topography of the Boer country, the readiness with
which it lends itself to defense, and that, occupied
and defended by a fighting people, struggling to save
their honjes and independence, it offered advantages
that equalized a small army with any force Great
Britain could safely spare to dispossess them?
If Gladstone estimated and weighed these items of
strategy and against them the advantages of conquest,
and saw to *the empire possible disaster greater
than probable advantages, and refrained from
further aggression, his place in history will
be greater than ever. Already England's mili
tary prestige has been impaired. Nothing but a
lack of concert, or a lack of motive, in continental
Europe stands between her and a descent upon the
frontiers of her wide possessions. Another four
months of failure and disaster in South Africa will
leave her at the mercy of any one who may have an
interest in attacking her. Plague and famine, in
volving forty millions of her Indian victims, are per
haps responsible for the failure of an outbreak there,
which may come yet. in spite of her caution to pre
vent among the natives any knowledge of the use of
artillery. If the estimate of military men be correct,
that a fully equipped force of a half-million of men,
artillery, cavalry and infantry, cannot pass the nat
ural fortresses and get into the Transvaal, though
faced by a defensive force of only one to ten, Eng
land is pushing a campaign that she cannot win.
Her people may well shudder at what lies beyond
final defeat. It may be read in the fate of all nations
that have run a like career.

ANOTHER PRIZE-FIGHT FAKE,
\A UCH of display has been given L to the reports
/ \ from New York that Jeffries and Corbett are
â¢ to come to San Francisco to fight for the
championship. The story is false. It was concocted
solely for the purpose of advertising and working up
popular interest in a kinetoscope exhibition of a
prize-fight. It is a trick, a fake and a fraud. It is one
more of the schemes which the swindlers of the
prize-ring have devised for working the public.
It is about time for the American people to learn
that the prize-ring as now conducted is a hippodrome
business from first to last. By patronizing it or any
thing connected with it there is given support to a
lot of pugs, thugs, blackguards, fakers and all-round
rascals.
The so-called "battle" between Corbett and Jeffries
may be puH'-i-dff somewhere, but it will not occur in
this city. The Call has positive information of the
trick. The whole thing, so far as San Francisco is
concerned, is but an advertising dodge hardly es
caping the category of swindles. It is to be hoped
the public will not be'deceived by it, nor be led by
it to contribute any money to the maintenance of the
disreputable gang that makes a living out of the ring
or out of the pugs that "battle" in it.
The fight against the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is
really a fight against the canal bill. With the oppo
sition anything which postpones the great enterprise
is good, and they hail the new controversy with de
light.
A BYGONE BOOK TRUST.
H;D\VARD MARSTON, a veteran London pub
lisher, in the course of an entertaining article
Â¦* * under the title, "A Publisher's Memories,"
gives in a recent number of the London Chronicle
an interesting account of an association formed by
publishers and booksellers in Great Britain in 1847
for the purpose of maintaining prices. It thus ap
pears that trusts are by no means a new thing in the'
world, and the story of the old enterprise is pertinent
to the issue which is now the subject of so much dis
cussion and controversy.
From the early part of the century, says Mr. Mar
ston, there was a complaint that the book trade was
"going to the dogs" by reason of the practice of un
dercutting and underselling by the book dealers. To
put an end to the practice the "Publishers' and Book
sellers' Association" was formed, and we are told the
"booksellers bound themselves not to sell books at
less than published prices, and publishers kept them
up to the mark by requiring them to sign an agree
ment not to undersell in any way; then a ticket was
issued to them, which was pasted into the collectors'
books, and without the exhibition of the ticket at any
time when called for booksellers could not get their
supplies from the publishers."
It would seem that such a combination had control
of the trade. A publisher who ventured to undersell
his competitors could not get dealers to handle his
books, and dealers who undertook to cut prices
could not get publishers to furnish them with books.
It looked like a cinch, and as a matter of fact it
worked admirably for a time. In the end, however
the scheme broke down. A few publishers and a few
booksellers saw a splendid advantage in staying out
of the combination and making an appeal to the pub
lic against it. Popular sentiment was on their side,
and in the end the association had to be abandoned!
In reviewing the case Mr. Marston says: "The
question as to the right of booksellers and publishers
to combine in this way was submitted to the decision
cf eminent Judges, lawyers and literary men, who
decided, not that the combination was illegal, but
that it was impolitic and distinctly against public in
terest. The associations thereupon gave up the
struggle, and from that time till now 'underselling'
has become a part of the education of book
buyers, who were taught to regard seventy-two
pence (being the published price of a book) as the
exact equivalent of 4s 6d. To one who, like myself,
has witnessed the struggle from the beginning, it has
been curious to note that the complaints of to-day
and the arguments used pro and con are precisely
the same as those of fifty years ago."
This story of the effort of a former generation to
regulate and fix prices of a particular article may

riodicity," as
Mr. Le Galllenne
terms itâ the . "pro
phet" opens his lips,
and a new play
comes forth which,
in the minds of the
Ibsenltes. makes all
other literary events
of the year pale in
conj p a rison. The
end of the year 1539
was thus blessed,
for in Copenhagen,
on December 19, was
published the text of
Ibsen's j long-expect
ed and mystery
enwrapped drama.
The very title in
spires a sense of
mysteryâ it Is called
"When We Dead
Awaken." Mr. Wil
liam Archer Is busi
ly engaged In trans
lating the play from
the Danish. In the
meantime, Mr. Le
Gallienne, writing in
the Boston Trans
cript (January 13)
gives the earliest
published resume of
the drama. Refer
ring to the title, he
says:
"You will hardly
guess its signin
cance till you read
the play, or are told
âa significance all
the more important
as coming from so
old a man, and a
writer who is per
haps the last from
we would expect the
message. The 'dead'
who 'awake' are
those who at the
end of their lives
suddenly understand
that they have missed the one
thing: in life worth living for. They
have, maybe, lived lives, of high
idealism; they have been mighty servants
of beauty or knowledge; but they have
missedâ LOVE. In fact the message of
'When We Dead Awaken' is the old mes
sage of 'Love Is Enough' â a message one
hardly expected to hear Ibsen proclaim
ing, and one the more significant from
him, as I have said, because he has waited
till old age to proclaim it."
Mr. Le Galllenne gives the following
outline of the plot: .'.'.
" 'When We Dead Awaken' Is in three
acts, and the following is a list of the
dramatis personae:
Professor Arnold Rubek Sculptor
Fru: Maja Rubek His Wife
The Inspector at the watering place ..Ulfhejm
<A rtch landed proprietor, and hunter
of biif same, particularly bears).
A Travellnc Lady Nurse
("Diakonlsse" in Norwegian. A woman
something between a Sister of Mercy and
a hospital nurse. She wears religious
garb, but Is not in orders).
Walters, guests at watering place and children.
"The first act takes place at a watering
place along the coast of Norway; the sec
ond and third acts in the neighborhood of
a mountain sanatorium.
"In a double sense the play is an epi
logue, for the formative action has
taken place before- the play be
gins and the drama, so far as
it is a drama at allâ for It is rather
a poem in dialogueâ is a drama of simple
conclusions. Let me first sketch the story
in a few words and fill in the sketch more
fully here and there later on. Years be
fore the play opens, Professor Arnold
Rubek, now a sculptor of world-wide
fame, had known a great love which had
inspired him to do his most inspired work,
namely, 'The Day of Resurrection.' A
great loveâ and yet not a love at all; for
Rubek had been one of those men whom
one might call the monks of art, and had
loved beauty with so pure a flame that
when Irene had given up all the world to
live with him and inspire his great work,
loving him humanly as women do, he.
really loving her, too, had crushed down
the mortal love in his heart and forbid
den himself to lay human hands on the
holy beauty which he was to immortalize.
Into his great pure work must creep no
single trait of .common passion. Irene
should be his divine model, and that
alone. Rubek kept his vow too well, for,
when the great work was finished. Irene,
broken-hearted to be thus worshiped as
an ideal, when she was longing to be tak
en into his arms as a woman, goes away.
She exhibits Rubek's holy love in music
halls, takes many lovers, callously mar
ries, riots her life to ashes. Rubek pur
sues the path of his art, wins great fame
and wealth, returns to his native Norway
(which had not previously appreciated
himâ mark hers \one of several autobio
graphic touches) and marries a pretty lit
tle empty-headed bourgeois, of whom he
is soon as thoroughly sick as she is of
him At this point the play takes up the
story At a Norwegian watering place to
gether they are mutually bored. They
never had anything really in common and
now they make no pretense of it. Fru:
Maja cares nothing for his art, great or
little: she reproaches him with doing no
great work nowadays He .only makes
busts of celebrities at high prices. In the
husband's answer to her reproach the
"ardonlc scorn of the artist toward hu
manity Is cruelly direct.
" 'There is something covert,' he says,
'something hidden, behind these busts,
soirfethlng secret, which men cannot see.'
I can't see it, and
I enjoy it densely. Outside is the striking
.VÂ»rÂ£Â«i as they call It, at which people rape

STATE SUPERVISION OF TELE
PHONES.
Vfl ASSACHUSETTS aspires to lead the way
/ \ in the establishment of a comprehensive and
effective State supervision of telephone com
panies. A bill has been introduced into the Legisla
ture of that commonwealth entitled, "An act rela
tive to charges and service of companies engaged in
the transmission of intelligence by electricity." We
learn from the discussion of the bill in the Boston
papers that the intent of the measure is to bring tele
graph and telephone services, and particularly the lat
ter, under official supervision, for the purpose of put
ting an end to extortionate charges.
The question is not a new one in Massachusetts
politics. The people of that State are more homo
geneous than those of most American common
wealths, and are therefore better fitted to act together
for the protection and preservation of the rights of
individuals from aggressions of corporate rapacity.
Consequently while in most States the people have
hardly done more than to denounce the telephone
exactions and extortions, the citizens of 'Massachu
setts have long since undertaken to establish justice
by law.
In the past there have been three attempts made to
provide for State supervision, but for one reason or
another all have failed. This time there is a fair pros
pert of success. The Boston Herald, in commenting
on the outlook, says: "The foundations of railroad
* upervision by the Government, laid down by the first
Board of Massachusetts Railroad Commissioners,
gave to their work a. high reputation all over the
country, from Maine to California. Massachusetts
was the pioneer in this duty, and the path she hewed
out has been imitated in a greater or less degree by
almost every State in the Union. We hope that a
similar service can be done both for the State and
the country in the matter of telephone supervision."
With the movement for governmental relief from
the intolerable practices of the telephone monopoly,
the people of every part of the country will have
sympathy, but if Massachusetts is to lead the way in
providing Â«uch ?uprrviÂ«ion her legislators will have to
act promptly. It is certain that in many other States
the issue will be dealt with as soon as the Legisla
tures meet, and it is safe to say the corporations will
not be able to defeat the reform in every case.
From the present outlook there is every reason to
believe the issue will be one of the chief questions
before the California Legislature next winter. How
ever aggressive and extortionate the telephone com
panies may have been in Massachusetts, they are not
likely to have equaled the rapacity and the insolence
of the company in this city and in the State gener
ally. They have not met a municipal tax with the
announcement that they "would take h out in the
bill," and make the patrons of the company "do
some lively kicking." That style of thing has been
left for the Sunset Telephone Company of this city.
The tax-shirking dodge, in addition to general extor
tion, is a distinctively California issue.
It is fortunate the telephone company has precipi
tated the issue upon the people on the very eve of a
State election. This fall the voters of California will
have an opportunity to elect men who in the Legis
lature will maintain the rights of the public. Massa
chusetts has the honor of leading the way in pro
riding for State supervision of railways. Perhaps
California may have the honor of leading in the es
tablishment of an effective supervision of telephones.
The thing murt come sooner or later, and it should
come next winter.

SCHROEDER WILL
GOVERN TUTUILA
Long Decides Upon His
Appointment.
>
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â It has been
practically decided by the Secretary of
the Navy to appoint Commander Seaton
Schroeder to be the first naval governor
of the Samoan island of Tutulla. Com
mander Schroeder is at present on duty
In Washington as a member of the board
charged with the revision of the naval
regulations. This work Is about complet
ed, so that the officer will be able to
leave for his new post at an early day.
It is expected that Captain Tilley of the
Abarenda, thÂ© station ship at Pago Pago,
will look after the United States' Inter
ests at Tutulla until the regular Gover
nor's arrival. It Is understood that Cap
tain Tilley has already notlfleS the native
Inhabitants of the annexation of tho
Island. The work of establishing a coal
ing station has been vigorously pushed
and now that a Governor is to be ap
nointed the department will take steps to
have a suitable residence erected foe
his occupation, In addition to the coal
sheds and machinery bullding3 already
under erection at Pago Pago.
For a time at least the department will
maintain one of the auxiliary vessels as
a station ship at Pago Pago, although,
as Captain Tilley is to come home in the
spring some other vessel than the Aba
renda may be assigned to this duty.
The naval officers have Just completed
another survey of Pago Pago harbor. It
discloses tho fact that the harbor is well
nigh perfect and, beyond placing two
buoys on as many rocks, there is no oc
casion to expend any money for improve
ments, Â¦--Â¦f-v - 11-::
TRANSPORTS TO
BE GIVEN BACK
TO THE OWNERS
Uncle Sam Wants
Them No More.
TO ENTER THE COAST TRADE
SEVEN OF THEM WILL BE RE
LEASED THIS WEEK.
There are over a dozen transports at
present in port, but In a few days the
majority of them will be released and
then Uncle Sam will be reduced to de
pending upon his own purchased vessels.
The Thomas, Meade and Manauense are
at Folsom-street wharf, the Ohio at Mis
sion-street wharf, the Ben Mohr and the
Pathan at Harrison-street wharf, the
Sherman on Hunters Point drydock, the
Logan, St. Paul and Indiana in the
stream and the Columbia in quarantine.
Of these the Manauense Is going Into
the island trade; the Ohio and Indiana
will carry gold hunters to Cape Nome;
the Ben Mohr becomes a collier; the Pa
than will load wheat for South Africa;
the St. Paul will carry passengers to tho
gold fields for the Alaska Commercial
Company and the Columbia will go on the
run between the Sound and the Orient.
Uncle Sam has therefore in port the
Thomas, Meade, Sherman and Logan, all
of which will be loaded with "casuals"
and supplies for the soldiers now in the
Philippines and sent back to Manila as
quickly as possible.
The transport St. Paul came down from
quarantine yesterday and will dock to
day. She has on board a handsome deer
destined for the Smithsonian Institution.
The animal was captured by Captain
Chase during his pursuit of Aguinaido
across the island of Luzon. It differs In
many respects from any of the same fam
ily known to science, so Captain Chase Is
sending it East to have the animal classi
fied. It is remarkably fleet of foot and
took a great amount of labor to capture.
Captain Hayes of the St. Paul suggests
that it be called Aguinaido.
The American bark Wallace B. Flint,
now loading at New York for Honolulu,
and the American ship Emily F. Whitney,
now on her way from Manila to Kahului,
have been purchased by Alexander &
Baldwin of this city. On the arrival of
the Flint at Honolulu she will load sugar
for San Francisco. The Whitney will do
likewise upon her arrival at Kahului.
Alexander & Baldwin are the agents for
the famous Makaweli plantation on the
island of Kawaui, and in order to move
the crcp they have been compelled to buy
a fleet of vessels, as they could not char
ter any.
The Kosmos liner Volumnla got away
for Central and South American and
European ports yesterday, loaded to the
guards with freight. When off the Pre
sidio there was a slight mishap to the ma
chinery and she was compelled to anchor
for two hours. Repairs were made in that
time and the steamer proceeded to sea.
George Johnson, a boarder in the Model
lodging-house, was taken to the Harbor
Hospital early yesterday morning, suffer
ing from epilepsy. He died in one of the
fits and his body was removed to the
Morgue.
Michael O'Brien was treated at the Har
bor Hospital by Dr. Cherry for a frac
tured jaw. Later he was removed to the
City and County Hospital. Michael came
down from Stockton on the steamer Mary
Garratt, so he says, and was beaten near
ly to death by one of the crew. He also
asserts that he was robbed of $30, but as
he was so drunk that he did not know his
own name when brought to the hospital,
the chances are Michael is telling a "fairy
tale."
The Seventh Day Adventists are fitting
out the brig Pitcairn for a voyage to Cape
Nome. In consequence, she was the only
vessel on the front yesterday on which' no
work was done. The repairs to her will
go on to-day, however.
Captain Hansen, late of the barkentine
Quickstep, will take command of the ship
Lucille on her arrival here. Captain An
derson of the Lucille has taken command
of the ship Charles E. Moody, now load
ing coal on the Sound for Honolulu.
The United States cruiser Philadelphia
will be thrown open to the public to-day
After 1 p. m. Peterson's launches will car
ry passengers to and from Folsom street
steps to the warship.
The overdue steamer George W. Elder
reached port yesterday. The delay was
caused by the breaking of her thrust shaft
In the Columbia River.
The transport Columbia arrived from
the Philippines yesterday. She brought
neither freight nor passengers, but was
placed In quarantine because she stopped
at Honolulu on her way to Manila.
The insurrection in Colombo is daily
gaining ground and Panama was under
martial law when the City of Para was
there. None of the officers or men of the
vessel were allowed ashore while she was
at the isthmus.

vention of Cruelty -to Animals told the
court a peculiar story.
According to Hooper a man named Mc-
Donald has been using influence to keep
the witnesses from testifying in the case.
McDonald approached Hooper to see if
the case could not be kept out of court,
and the officer refused to listen to the
proposition. Something 1 had evidently
been done, for none of the witnesses were
on hand when the case was called. Judge
Cahanlss continued the. case till Tuesday,
and stated that if the witnesses were not
present the court would hold McDonald
personally responsible for having intimi
dated them.
Hooper made an investigation to find
what figure McDonald cut in the matter
and learned that he was a friend of the
accused and had threatened to turn Mrs.

Berkeley's Student Congress Gather
Together to Celebrate a Victory.
"The Students' Congress." the leading
debating society of Berkeley, held a ban
quet in the California Hotel last evening
to celebrate the victory that has been
theirs through one of their number, W.

A sumptuous collation had been pre
pared for the students of oratory, and
covers had been laid for fifty guests.
When Toastmaster A. J. Cloud arose to
make a few opening remarks it was ob
served that not one of the fifty places
remained unfilled. ".-Â¦*' V : :
The invited guests, aside from the reg

Each of these gentlemen, when called
upon, arose and said something appro

for the most part impromptu, and the
good things that were said on the spur of
the moment showed a wit, ability and
knowledge of current affairs of which
many a public man of far greater age
might have well been proud.
After the principal speeches and- toasts
came songs and toasts, college yells and

RECOGNIZED AT
SACRAMENTO AS
IN THE GUARD
First Regiment Now
in Service.
ELECTION OF FIELD OFFICERS
â¢
CHANGE IN REGULATIONS HAS
BEEN ORDERED.
Lieutenant Colonel Victor D. Duboce,
the ranking staff officer of- the First Regi
ment of Infantry, received cheering news
from superior hadquarters at Sacramento
yesterday In the shape of orders In which
is the following:
A sufficient number of companies having re
ported for duty Id the Firet Infantry Regiment,
under the act of March 21, IS3S, and the provi
sions of General Orders Xo. 11, Series of 1539,
A. O. G., said regiment is hereby recognized as
an organized regiment of the National Guard
of California and returned to duty, as provid
ed by Ed!<l act and order.
The field, staff and non-commissioned officers
of sal 3 regiment who have reported under the
provisions of said act and order are hereby
recognized as belonging to and being on duty
with such regiment from the date of their so
reporting.
The companies that have been accepted
are A, C, D, F, G, I, X and M. ThoÃe
that have not yet been accepted are B, E,
II and L. It 1b expected that within a
day or two orders accepting B and L will
be received, so that will form a ten-com
pany regiment. The other two companies
are behind because certain formalities
have not yet been complied with. During
the early part of the week Lieutenant
Colonel Duboce, being ranking officer of
the regiment, wilj Issue an order announc
ing that he has taken command and sub
sequently there will be a call for an elec
tion for field officers. The elections will
all be held the same night with a view to
prevent friction and dissatisfaction, as
would follow If elections were held on dif
ferent nights, as the first elected would
take rank on account of priority of com
missions in case new captains should be
chosen. On the night of the elections offi
cers elected will be given precedence ac
cording to commission and service.
Lieutenant Colonel Duboce, in speaking
of the return of the regiment to service,
said that work was being done in Sacra
mento, work was being done here and
that the regiment is ready at very short
notice in case of an emergency to turn
out fully equipped, having all that is req
uisite except new uniforms. "We have,
said he, "enough old uniforms, and while
they are not very pretty and would not
look well on parade they would answer In
case of need. '
The election In the companies will be an
exciting event. A number of the captains
and lieutenants will not be candidates,
as some of the captains feel that they do
not care to be slaughtered. Several lieu
tenants will seek promotion and there are
not a few first sergeants who will be on
hand seeking election as second lieuten
ants After the officers shall have qual
ified there will be an election for staff of
ficers. The lieutenant colonel will be a
candidate for the position of colonel, as
it has been given out by the opinion of the
Attorney General that there Is a vacancy
In the office of colonel which was held
by now Brigadier General James F.
Smith. It Is also stated that Captain
Thomas O'Neil will be a candidate for the
colonelcy. Captain Cunningham, who
was major of volunteers when the First
California was mustered out, will be a
candidate for the position of major of the
regiment and before the election comes
off there will be a full crop of availables.
Major J. A. Margo, commissary. Sec
ond Urigade, has been detailed to pre
side at an election for major of the Fifth
Infantry, vice Elliott, who resigned to
accept a commission in the United States
volunteers. The election will be held at
brigade headquarters on the evening of
the 21st inst.. and it Is stated that Cap
tain Poulter of Company A. Oakland;
Captain Wenk of Company F, Oakland,
and Captain Simpson of Company G, Al
ameda, are candidates for the position.
No one has yet been named for the po
sition of colonel and assistant adjutant
general on the staff of the major general,
vice Colonel Cluff. deceased, but an im
preEsion prevails that the position will be
offered to Lieutenant Colonel D. E. Miles
of the division staff.
The following changes in the guard not
previously noted in this department have
been announced by superior headquar
ters:
Second Regiment-William Walter Greer to
he major, vice Carenn. retired.

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Feb. 11.â
As' the Hay-Pauncefote treaty comes to
be better understood it is gaining strength
in both houses of Congress. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
There are 'men in both houses who
would favor the adoption of a dog in the
manger policy and defeat canal legisla
tion altogether rather than have the
waterway open to ships of all nations on
equal terms, but the conviction is growing
that this policy would be very unwise.
Fortifying the canal, upon which much
stress is laid in some quarters, would, it
is urged by the advocates of . the treaty,
simply entail additional expense upon the
United States. It is maintained that the
canal can be better defended by war
ships with bases of operations, at Puerto
Rico, the Danish West Indies and the
south side of Cuba in the east and Hawaii
and the Galapagos Islands In the Pacific
than would be possible with land batteries
at Its entrance. Its best defense, it is
contended, will be the agreement of all
the great nations that its neutrality shall
be respected.
The objection that the treaty will not
permit discrimination in favor of Ameri
can vessels is met by the statement that
even if the United States had it in its
power to grant such discriminations it
would be the height of folly to do so. The
inevitable result, it is said, would be the
impost of discriminating duties on.Ameri
can goods and discriminating tonnage and
port duties on American steamers by the
commercial nations discriminated against
in the canal.
For these reasons there is a strong sen
timent in Congress in favor of action on
the treaty and on the canal bill regard
less of the obstacles various syndicates
and other opposing interests are striving
to place in the way. â¢
Representative Hepburn is not dlspo?ed
to regard the Eyre-Cragen concession as
an obstacle to the construction of the
canal by the United States. He said to
day that the concession would be prac
tically valueless, because the Government
of Costa Rica had refused to grant any
concessions, and without the right to build
that part of the canal running throusn
Costa Rican territory the grant of Nica
ragua would be useless.
While he is errphatically opposed to the
pending Hay-Pi-.uneefote treaty, on the
ground that it will prevent the Unl'.od
States from granting discriminating rates
to American ships, it is not Mr. Hepburn's
disposition to delay action on his bill on
this account. Ho said he would have his
report rrady in a few days and would try
to get it up in the House during this
"1 believe especially that the canal
shculd be built by this country without
any attempt at fortifications," said Sena
tor Davis. "The guarantee of the nations
of the civilized world will stand for keep-
Ins it open in times of war as well as in
times of peace. The great powers would
rise up In a body against any belligerent
nation attempting to seize and hold the
canal against an enemy. No better guar
antee than this agreement on the part of
the nations could be given by guns and
fortifications. " ,
*!The cost of fortifications for the canal
would be enormous. I â¢ should Eay that
anywhere from $50,000,000 to J80.000.000
would be required to adequately foitify
the structure against the possibility of
armed attack.
"In the case of the Suez canal England
leaves it open to the passage of ships of
any nation. Whether or not it would be
practicable to fortify that structure I do
not know, but that England has not found
it expedient to do#o is apparent. What
England has done with her canal we can
do with ours." .

DOGS SHOW
SPEED AT
UNION PARK
Closely Matched in the Open
Stake Which Forms This
Week's Card.
The greyhounds entered In the open
stake at Union Coursing Park this week
are so evenly matched that the ttrst round
yesterday did not develop any pronounced
favorite. The bettors apparently like the
chances of either Cavalier or Master Clair
for first place, as they have been installed
lukewarm favorites. Next to these Kid
McCoy and Carmencita are in demand.
Hot Haste, Chicago Boy. Mac's Melody,
Brutus, Sylvanus and Crawford Braes are
favored by some bettors, who expect one
of this group to carry off first honors.
Thp run-down yesterday provided high
class sport. The hares were strong, and
with a clear sky, which did not obscure
their vision, they made direct for the.es
capes. There was but one unsatisfactory
course and Judge Grace promptly declared
all bets off. It was in the meeting of Tcr
rona and Craig Boy. They rirst ran a
short undecided course, each scoring
four points. In this Craig Boy stumbled
and fell twice. The dogs were sent back
to the slips again. This time they had a.
much longer course, in which Craig Boy
fell seven times. The cause of this re
markable showing did not appear on the
surface. Judge orace promptly declared
all bets off and was applauded by the
spectators.
Stonehenge, an Australian dog, madÂ©
his first appearance and made a creditable
showing against Jennie Wilson, which
won by a score of 5 to 4. Pasha Kennels'

PROPOSED TREATY AS

NICARAGUAN CANAL MUST BE
WHOLLY AMERICAN.
Iroquois Club Sees Danger in Grant
ing 1 Concessions to Any For

At a largely attended meeting of the Iro
quols Club <}f Ban Francisco a debate was
held on the advisability of the United
States Senate giving Its sanction to the
treaty regarding the Nicaragua canal that
has been drawn up recently by Lord
Fauncefote and Secretary of State Hay.
The matter was brought up by the pre
sentation of a resolution by A. D. Lemon,
Â¦which was as follows:
Whereas, The British-American treaty, pre
pared by Lord Pauncefote (the English Minis
ter) and Secretary of State Hay of our Gov
ernment, and concurred In by President Mc-
Kinlev. and by them recommended to the Sen
ate of the United States for its ratification. Is
un-American in the highest degree In this:
Firstâ That it fails to recognize, as the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty did, the validity, or existence
even, of the Monroe doctrine, so long recog
nized as one of the cardinal principles of the
political pulley cf our country as applied to
European and other foreign powers, and the
great prutector of Democratic-Republican Insti
tutions in the Western Hemisphere.

letter from Addlson Kelly, who coached
the blue and gold team during that pe

will a'6cept California's offer for the corn
ins: season.
Kelly was offered $1500 but he refused,
and California's management looked for
other material. The letter to Muma states
that Kelly would not coach any other
team but the blue and gold, and this is
couched in such terms that there is hardly
a doubt but that he will accept tne orig
inal terms.
responsibility of constructing and maintaining
this great International waterway upon our
Government, or Its people. It yet, under th*
terms of the treaty, gives It over to tha world's
use in war or peace and forbids our GorÂ«rn

protection o rthe protection of our navy or

Special Dispatch to The Call,
REDLAJCDS, Feb. 10.â "Consecrated
Giving" was the Bible study subject at
this morning's session of the Y. M. C. A.
convention. The first address was "The
Ideal Association in Business," by
Charles A. Maydwell of San Francisco.
He said that to produce an ideal asso
ciation in Its business relations there
ehould be an ideal toward which to work.
As a Christian association, it 6hould be a
model organization in the prosecution of
the business portion of its affairs. The
business of tne association should be con
ducted by a board of directors instead of
having Its secretary not only the spiritual
leader, finance committee, auditor, treas
urer, etc.. but business head as well.
Committees should be appointed with
reference to fitness. The finance com
mittee should have the money" necessary
for a full year's needs pledged at the be
ginning of the year. The secretary
should present to the board at its month
ly meetings a carefully prepared and ac
curate report without exaggeration. In
the ideal association it is necessary that
aJI should do their respective parts with
the'r whole hearts.
A. A. Macurda. educational director of
the association at San Francisco, deliv
ered an excellent address upon "The As
sociation as an Educational Factor." He
paid in part that if the school career of
700 boys be considered it would be found
that 600 leave school before 14 years old
and 300 go to school until they are 15. The
percentage of those who finish the grades
is as follows: Ten per cent complete the
primary education, 5.6 of 1 per cent grad
uate from the high school. 1.15 of 1 per
cent finish the university or technical
course of instruction.
In the average city of 73,000. according
to the institutional committee, but one
boy in 300 completes the course in the
public schools. A large proportion of
noys leave high school at about 16 years,
just the age at which they may be ad
mitted to the evening classes of the
Young Men's Christian Association.
There wore 22.73S students enrolled in the
association classes during the past year.
Seven associations have educational
funds amounting to $1,700,000. The latest
educational development is in the line of
Industrial and technical Instruction. In
England from 3 to 8 per cent of the popu.
!ation is in the evening schools: In the
United States, where the greatest atten
tion is devoted to such work, less than 1
per cent is found in the night school.
Fifty associations need experienced men
es educational directors, yet if an in
experienced boy should be placed in
charge as director simply because he
could be secured at a salary of from $4CK>
to $700 for the entire time, it would In
jure both the boy and the work. This
cheap John policy in employment of edu
cational directors is the poorest kind of
association economy. There is $100,000,003
Invested in this country for the educa
tion of 70.000 men. With almost 30,000 stu
dents, not $2,000,000 is yet devoted to the
association educational work in the way
of endowment.
The executive committee recommended
that $4000 be set aside for the State work;
$1300 for the army and navy; the setting
aside for State work of 50 cents per mem
ber, when sufficient funds are secured; an
other State Secretary be secured; that a
pr'-ater effort be made to secure more in
dividual contributors until at least 3000 are
secured: that every effort be made to re
duce the indebtedness on buildings and

BERLJN. Feb. 10.â An official of the
German Foreign Office who was ques
tioned to-day regarding the utterances of
Duke Johann Albrecht, the regent of the
Grand Duchy of Mecklenberg-Schwerin,
to a French newspaper man, said:
"It Is true Duke Albrecht received the
Eclalre representative, but the latter evi
dently greatly exaggerated the Duke's
utterances. The French are doing every
thing possible to disturb the friendly re
lations between Germany and England.
After Fashoda France's most reasonable
policy would have been to establish an
understanding with England In regard to
the colonial question, but instead of this
the Paris Cabinet seeks every opportun
ity to create enemies for England. If
M. Delcasse thinks it is to France's ad
vantage to systematically agitate against
England he can do so, but he must not
try to rupture Anglo-German friend
ship." " Â¦' .
Referring to the visit of Prince Henry
of Prussia the foreign. official said:
"The immediate object is to present
himself to- Emperor Francis Joseph as
an Austrian vice admiral, to which rank
he ;was recently nominated. A political
purpose may be assigned to the visit, as
Germany wishes to show that all recent
attempts to shake the Driebund have
been fruitless. The Dreibund's enemies
in Paris and St. Petersburg must be
shown that all the recent intrigues have
had no result. Germany emphasized this
by Prince Henry's visit first to Ger
many's ally."
The Reichstag debate on the naval bill
and the question "Will It pass?" over
shadow everything ' just now. But the
queer fact deserves recording that the
much-heard-of enthusiasm and so-called
hurrah seems to have suddenly oozed
away as the naked facts confronted the
speakers both for the Government and
the opposition. Even Herr Rlchtcr, the
Radical leader, whose wit and keen
speech are usually relished even In the
Oblnet, was not at his best on Friday.
The Secretary of the Admiralty, Admiral
Tirpitz. spoke several times lengthily,
but only once spiritedly. Intrinsically
the best speech was that of the Secretary
of the Interior, Count yon Posadowski-
Wehner, who made a strong case in fa
vor of the contention that the nation
would not need new taxation after doub
ling the navy. He also proved that, after
passing the bill, Germany protected her
merchant marine with one ton of navy
against seven and one-half tons of mer
chant ship, while the United States' pro
portion was tlve to one, Italy's one to
three and Russia's and France's even
less. He made a strong point in Insist
ing that the Bundesrath pass the bill at
both readings unanimously.
The absence and probable death of Dr.
I,ieber; the Centrist leader, lessen the
chances of the bill, as Dr. ,L4eber would
have acted as a mediator between the
Government and the Center. There is no
body fit to take his plate as chief of the
Center.
Count yon Bulow. the Minister of For
eign Affairs, and the Emperor still take
care to vigorously destroy the impression
in England and elsewhere that Germany
nt any time meant to join in steps call
ing on Great Britain to halt in South
Africa. This impression has been cun
ningly nursed and fostered by French
diplomacy and In the French press and
Count yon Bulow believes It has been for
the purpose of projecting Great Britain
Into an openly hostile attitude to Ger
many. This purpose may now be consid
ered" to have failed. The whole German
semi-official press during the week has
published facts showing that Germany
wishes to remain a friend of both Russia
and France and with Great Britain, too.
Influenza has attained an enormous
spread throughout Germany. In Berlin
there is hardly one family without suf
ferers. One victim is the wife of the
Spanish Embassador, F. Mendez de Vigo.
The coal strike Is gradually extending
in Germany. The Halle and Lelpsic dis

that large factories have closed because

Protests Against Chinese Interpreter.
A protest was filed yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors by Jerome Millard
against the employment of a Chinaman
named Dong Kang. alias Dong Tyng. as

that the Chinaman named is a fugitive

he is an alien. Millard further alleges that
he is perfectly conversant with the vari
ous Chinese dialects and has acted ln the
same capacity prior to Dong Kang's em
ployment, which Is not justified under
the law nor fair In equity.

In it the movements of the dancers are the

WHEN the Bostonians undertake
to eclipse the successes scored
by '"Robin Hood" and "The

realizes that the task is no ordinary
one. Next Monday evening at the Co

will present to San Franciscans "The
Viceroy." which is said to possess
even greater merit than any of the
operas that have made the Bostonians
famous.
The story of "The Viceroy" is light,
clever and amusing and is full of in
cident specially designed to create
mirth. The tale is of Sicily in the
sixteenth century and. divided into
three acts. Jt tells of a certain Vice

AT OCEAN BEACH
Victims Looking for a
Robber Trio.

BOOTY CARRIED AWAY IN A
SPRING WAGON.
For several days the residents of Ocean
Beach have been on the lookout for ihi>:e
men who are believed to be the authors
of a number of daring robberies, and the
feeling runs co high that if the thieves
are captured they are more likely to be
sent to the Receiving Hospital than to
the City Prison. In two instances ti.e
men have been seen. driving a sorrel horde
attached to a light spring wagon.
The latest robbery occurred about 11
o'clock yesterday morning, the victim be
ing W. W. Whitworth. who is employ*..!
In hauling sand from the beach foi the
Government fortifications at Lime Point.
Whitwcrth's effects, along with those of
other workmen, have been kept in a barn
a short distance in the rear of Kroger's
saloon. About 11 o'clock a little sir!
rushed down to the beach and informed
Whitworth that a drunken man was car
rying some things out of the barn.
' Whitworth ran to the scene, only io find
that the man had taken the alarm and
decamped, with two others, in a spring
wagon drawn by a sorrel horse. Some
pieces of harness, a number of collar pads
and a pair of shoes had been stolen, while
a large bundle of clothing and portaD.e
articles which had been gathered together
by the marauders had been left behind in
their haste. , ?
\ fey.- days ago twenty-five sacks of bar
ley were stolen from the barn of a con
tractor named Dennison. and shortly a-t
.rward eight sacks of barley from Con
tractor Tuttle's barn. In the latter in
stance the thieves had carried six more
sacks outside the doorway, but were
frightened away before they had time to
place them in the wagon. On the Â«-arre
evening three men were seen driving along
the b<Â»ach in a southerly direction vith
several sacks of grain in the bed of their
wagon. _ , .. .
The thieves have not confined their
choice of plunder to grain and clothing
by any means, in several cases having
made raids on chicken roosts. The pro
prietor of the Seal Rock House lost some
fine fat fowls a few nights ago. and Fri
day evening a number of chickens woie
stolen from a widow living near the ter
minus of the electric line. Since yester
day's robbery the residents and tradesmt-.i
In 'the vicinity of Ocean Beach have kept
their eyes open for three men in a spring
wagon drawn by a sorrel horse, and IT
they are found and cannot give good ref
erences or explain their whereabouts on

LEGISLATIVE SESSION
Lawmakers Before Closing Up Shop Are
Inflicted With a Farewell Effusion
in Gage's Exclusive Style.
HIS EXCELLENCY'S PARTING MESSAGE.
QACRAMEXTO, Feb. 10.â Governor Gage sent the following message to the
O Legislature to-day:
Executive Department. State of California.
To the Assembly of the State of California: In my message to your honorable
body upon the first. day of this session I expressed my <â¢< r.fidence in you. and now.
at its close, you are to be congratulated, among other things, for the short dura
tion of this r-eission and its moderate cost.
You have passed laws recommendod in my proclamation, which, by reason of
the inestimable advantages which will redound to the ptople, have fully warrant
ed me in calling you together.
Obedient to the will of your constituents, you have sacrificed your personal
preferences to agree upon and select an able and worthy Senator to represent Cal
ifornia in the United States Senate at a juncture most important to the people of
the State and nationâ a juncture when the magnificent policy of cur President is
about to be judged by the people whom he has so faithfully and honorably ewrveu.
and when Congressional approval of that policy is necessary to firmly maintain.
as an inseparable part of our soil, thf: new American territory acquired by the
valor of our soldiers and sailors in a just and glorious war.
There have been passed, pursuant to my proclamation, the requested arneni
ments to the Political Code, which laws will soon result in most material improve
ment to the harbor of San Francisco, thereby inviting to our shores the shipping
of the world, and this great public advantage will be gained without the levy of
taxes or the Issuance of bonds.
You have enacted the laws for the improvement of the Sacramento. San Joa
quin. Feather and Tuolumne rivers recommended in my proclamation and have,
by this legislation, guaranteed protection to the extensive area of agricultur.-il
lands In the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.
By repealing section 13 of article 3 of "an act to establish a State Lunacy
Commission, to provide uniform government and management of the State hos
pitals for the insane, and to provide for the care, custody and apprehension of per
sons believed to be insane and the commitment of in3.ine persons, and providing
for the transfer of unexpended appropriations of moneys and. properties," ap
proved March 31. 1597. as recommended in my proclamation, you have empowered
the Lunacy Commission to reduce and regulate the cost of managing the SUita
hospitals for the insane, which will enable the commission to save to the people of
the State, through their new schedule of salaries upward of $50,000 for the re
maining three years of my official term, thus paying more than the whole expense
of this extraordinary session.
Your labors being now at an end, I beg leave to thank you for your earnest
assistance and to bid you God-speed.

Governor of the State of California.

Asserts That the Passage of the
Measure Would Work a Hard

WASHINGTON. Feb. 10.â In the Sen.
ate to-day the financial debate was con
tinued by Chandler of New Hampshire,
who opposed the gold standard and
strongly urged the double standard..
Chilton of Texas and Money of Missis
sippi also spoke.
During his speech Chandler said:
Thoae who have absorbed the gold of the
world are trying to make it more valuable by
legislation. This Is the natural meaning of
the nrst ten lines of the Senate bill. There is
no nei>*i of the law for any other object. Abso
lutely no other purpose is to be obnerved by
thtbe lmeÂ». The pasrage of the bill without
adequate recognition of the desire and deter
mination of tne American people that silver
Khali be remonetlzed is a defiance of the Re
publican platform of lS'^S. and without such
recognition In the bill I cannot give to it my
vote. It will be monometallism, unqualified
goM monometallism; and to advocate or submit
to this is an abandonment of Republican prin
ciples. â¢ , Â¦Â¦:â¢ .'-Â¦', .
Any retarding of the movement to make gold
more valuable does not suit the gold class.
Further uteps are. therefore, now demanded,
namely, that all the existing silver coin shall

and placed In the condition of credit moneyâ
that is. money all of which must be redeemed
on demand in gold. If this new principle is to
prevail the real money will be $4,000,000,000 of
gold and the credit money, including the silver
money, will be $10,000,000,000. And upon this
gold and other credit money are to be built all
the checks and other credits in trade through
out the world. How broad the summit and
how narrow the base 1 .
It is true that, because it is claimed that we
have now what are called good times and pros
perity in America, bimetallism should be ridi
culed and disregarded. Hut our good times are
simply because the balance of trade has been
co largely In our favor. What would have been
our condition If the balance of trade had not
been In our favor?
In truth, in spite of temporary present con
ditions the case In favor of bimetallism still re
mains unimpaired. The merits of bimetallism
are plain. The injury to result rrom gold
monometallism Is sure.
The Republican party Is pledged to bimetal
lism. Were we blunderers when we shouted
over and over again for remonettzatlon? Is it
not quite possible that we were right then and
are now wrong when H Is proposed to forever
discard remonetization?
I want the double standard. So do 1,800.000,000
of the people of this world of ours, while only
200,000.0Â«0 want the single gold standard. We
want thÂ« real money of the world to be 8,000,
000.0C0 of dollars in coin. They want It to be
only 4.000.0U0.000 of dollars.. The difference means
Injustice, injury, suffering and distress to mil
lions of God's poor people the world over, while
the gold claes Is to wax fat at the cost of their
helpless victims. The Republican party oufrht
not to direct any such grievous wrong. I en
treat its leaders not to burden us with gold
monometallism, but. to renew in unmistakable
language our oft-repeated pledges to remonetize
silver.
If we â¢ are true to our traditions a,nd the
wishes of our constituents we shall re-elect our
gracious and patriotic President by popular and
electoral majorities greater than any President
has ever received. Can we afford by the pass
ape of the needless first ten lines of this bill
without sufficient qualification to add to the
chances of his defeat?
At the conclusion of Chandler's ppeech
Chilton of Texas was recognized to ad
dress the Senate in opposition to the
pending measure, which he declared rep
resented the policy of the Republican ad
ministration. He urged that the main
object of the bill was to refund the en
tire national debt in long-time gold bonds.
This would insure perpetuity to the na
tional banks- and afford them a greatei
money monopoly even than they pos
sessed now. It would likewise destroy
all prospect of bimetallism so far as the
power of the Republican party could ac~
complish that result. He regarded it as
likely that a treasury ruling would be
made after -the passage of the pending
bill providing that silver dollars and sil
ver certificates should be made redeem
able in gold.
Chilton objected to the great power con
ferred by the Senate bill upon the Sec
retary , of .the Treasury and , maintained
that the authority for tha issuance of all

increase in the next five years as it had
increased in the last five there would be
a demand for the demonetization of gola
and the remonetization Â¦of silver. Ad
verting further along to the introduction

clared he did not believe In the sincerity
of any man "who did -not at all times
stand for his convictions. Said he:
I know where the demand for the adoption of
the bimetallic amendment came from. Hag the
chairman of the Finance Committee had his
ear to the ground and heard the rumbling in
the West over the pending bill, or has it again
been proposed to delude the people Into the fact
that this Is a Presidential year? The fact Is,
the Republican party Is absolutely faithless
upon this money question. This is perfectly
evident.

officers of the Marine Corps was passed.

A RESTAURANT EPISODE.
A Sort of Straw Vote.
An advertising agent, representing Â»
prominent New York magazine, while on
a recent Western trip, was diniss ond
evening i:i a Pittsbursr restaurant.
While waiting for hi.* order he glanced
over his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well-known dyspepsia
preparation. Stuart's Dyspepsla Tablets.
As he himself was a regular user of tha
tablets he began speculating as to how
many of the other traveling men in the
dining-room were also friend 3 of the pop-
ular remedy for indigestion.
He say*: "I counted twenty-three men
at the tables and in the hotel office I tool:
the trouble to Interview them and was
surprised to learn that nine of the twen-
ty-three made a practice of taking one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets aT-
ter each meal
"One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at on-Â»
time he had been obti-ed to qul: the
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from in-
digestion, but he continued their u.ie. es-
pecially while traveling, on account of ir-
regularity in meals and Cf-c:u:se. like all
traveling men, jhe was of ton obl?*ed to
eat what he could get and not always
"Another, who looked the picture of
health. SaM he never at? a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterr.-artl because
he could eat what he pleiisefl ar.ci when
he pleased, without fear uf a sleepless
night or any other trr.uble.
Still another u?al them because he was
subject t<> ga.-Â« en stomach, causing 1 pres-
sure on heart and lung*, shortness oi
breath ar.d distress in chest, which ho r.t>
longer experienced since using the tableu
regularly.
â¢'Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the on!y safe remedy
he had ever found for sour stomach ar.d
acidity. He had formerly used common.
soda to relieve the trouble, but tha tablets
were r.iuch better and safer to uje."
Afater smoking, drinking or other ex-
cesses -which weaken the digestive organs.
nothing restores the stomach to Â«i
healthy, -wholesome condition so effec-

Stuart's. Dyspepsia Tablets contain tha

KINDLING A COAL-PASSER.
Thrilling Incident on Board Trans-;
port Meade on the High Seas.
A fireman on the United States trans
port Mead e called yesterday at the office
of the United States Attorney and asked
to have a warrant issued for the arrest of
Second Assistant Engineer Murphy on a
charge of assault on the high seas. His
story was that on the return voyage to
this, port the first engineer, had announced
his intention of resigning, and th,e second;
third and fourth assistant engineers were
ambitious to obtain the vacant place. .To
this end they bent all their efforts to in
crease, the speed of the transport, each
wishing to make the best record on his
watch. To this end they made things
lively for the firemen, coal-passers and nil
others concerned with the duty of keeping
up steam. The visitor went on to say tl.Rt
Murphy; went down Into the engine-room
one day and seizing coal-passer Charles
McHugh' by the throat rammed the muz
zle of a revolver into his mouth and sev
eral Inches down his throat, and swore
in veritable sea phrase that he would blow
the top of his head through the lee scup-
pers if he didn't get more of a move on
and flreup at a livelier rate.
McHugh is in the Marine Hospital un
der treatment for cancer of the. stomach,
and Assistant United States Attorney
Banning deferred action until Monday in
order that he might have an opportunity
of investigating the matter.

through the park when his horse became

dashed along the main driveway at break

horse, started after it. - The use of a
lariat brought the animal to a standstill
near the Cyclers' Rest.
Baker thanked the captain for his ac
tion and resumed his journey, but again
his horse became unmanageable and
Thompson was obliged to stop it for a
second time near the conservatory- *

GOOD-THING VUCOVICH
Came From Stockton to Give a Bunko
Man Eighty Dollars for a PiecÂ«
of Waste Paper.
An unknown bunko steerer found a good
thing from Stockton yesterday morning in
the person of Lazar Vucovich, a new and
very raw arrival from the Slough City.
Vucovlch was standing in front of an
employment office on Sutter street waiting
for work when the steerer approached
and asked him whether he was looking
for work. Upon Vucovich replying in the
affirmative the Bteerer informed him that
he had a situation for him as porter in a
wholesale liquor establishment at $2 per
day.
The steerer took the guileless Stock
tonlan to the -Montgomery block, on Mont
gomery street, between Merchant and
Washington streets, and while they were
standing in the hallway of the building a
confederate of the steerer approached and
asked for the loan of $10. The bunko man
was willing to oblige his friend and re
gretted that he did not have that much
ready cash on his person at that moment,
but he had a check for $175, payable to
Roach & Co., and asked Vucovich whether
he would oblige by letting him have the
money on the check and he would be re
paid as soon as they could get the check
cashed. Vucovich was willing to oblige
the good stranger who was to get him a
good job at $2 per Â«lay, and opened his
purse, displaying $80 in gold. The steprer
took the gold, handed Vucovich the check
and went up stairs.
That was the last the Stocktonlan saw
of him. The check was addressed to no
body, and Vucovich has not succeeded In
getting. anybody to buy it from him at
any price.
LONDON LIFE ATTACHED.
Show at the Alhambra in a Peck of
Trouble.
An attachment was levied Friday night
on J. Duke Murray, manager of the "Lon
don Life," now playing at the Alharr.bra
Theater. The writ was taken out in the
Sheriff's office at the instance of Eliza
Marburg, proprietress of the play, who
lives in the East, and was for JlwQ for roy
alties claimed to be due her. Deputy Sher
iff Waibel served the' papers while tho
play was going on, but there was no in
terruption of the performance. As there
was no money In the box-office belonging
to Murray the stage effects and scenery
used in the play were levied upon.
Murray claims the trouble is due to the
neglect of his partner in New York to ren
der the statements forwarded by him to
Mrs. Marburg. He says the show has had
a run of hard luck and business in this
city was poor. When he started out with
the show Mrs. Marburg told him to do the
best he could with it, and he cannot un
derstand why she has brought the attach
ment. He says that she will withdraw
It as soon as. she sees the statements he
has sent East.

NOTORIOUS CROOKS
SEVERELY PUNISHED
THREE THIEVES ARE GIVEN
LONG TERMS.
Piggott's Case Will Soon -Be Settled.
Criminals Sent to Prison for
Various Offenses.
Three notorious crooks were put away
for some time to come by Judge Cook yes
terday. Fred Smith, who has served many
years of his life behind prison, bars., was
up for sentence after being convicted on
a charge of robbery. He took a: gold
watch and ' chain and $45 from Henry
Davis, and foolishly demanded a trial,
during which it developed that several
prior convictions stood against his name.
The court said that as it was evident that
the prisoner was an habitual criminal he
gave him the limitâ twenty years in Fol
som Prison.
Edward C. Wilson and Martin Lyman
were convicted of burglary for hav
ing entered the store of M. Mossford,
3Si5 Twenty-fourth street. When arrested
both men were heavily armed, and h\view
of the theory that they were prepared if
necessary to commit murder the court or
dered them confined in San Quentln for a
term of fifteen years. William Avery,
convicted for the second time on a charge
of petty larceny, was sent to San Quentin
for five years. -iv.c, ;.,â¢.._
John Piggott, who sought to escape pun
ishment for his many crimes on tho
ground that he had been legally an inmate
of a State insane asylum and had never
been restored to capacity, appeared before
the same court. A certificate of discharge
was produced, showing that the prisoner
had been restored to capacity, and George
D. Collins, who represents the prisoner,
was forced to. surrender. Judge Cook will
hand down his decision on Monday.
Henry Burke, convicted of grand lar
ceny, was sentenced to a term of three
years In San Quentln.
Samuel Anderson, convicted of an as
sault for having threatened Martin John
son with a pistol, was fined $100.
HOSPITAL SUPPLIES.
Complaints of Their Impurity Will
Be Investigated.
Commissary Maguire of the City and
County Hospital will make a complaint
at the meeting of the Board of Health
next Friday evening that the contractors
for supplies at the institution are not
living up to the terms of their contracts.
Especially is this true regarding the eggs
recently sent to the hospital. "While the
contract calls for fresh California eggs
at 21 cents a dozen it is claimed that
Eastern case eggs are being substituted
in their stead and many complaints are
being made by the patients and it has
been found necessary to go into open
market and purchase fresh eggs, which
will be charged to the contractors. This
was also done with some bad butter re
cently furnished the institution and the
plan may put an end to the questionable
practices of the contractors.
It is said that the latter are endeavor-
Ing to make a profit on eggs, which are
now Quoted at a low rate, in order to
offset the losses they sustained when
eggs were 40 and 50 cents a dozen. As the
contract price is 21 cents it is easy to see

FOOTPADS ROB
A SOLDIER AT
THE PRESIDIO
Sergeant Alois Fleck
Badly Beaten.
ASSAULTED BY MASKED MEN
Â»
MAKES A HAB.D FIGHT, BUT IS
OVERPOWERED.
Three bold footpads Invaded the Pre-
Eidlo Friday night and waylaid Sergeant
Alois Fleck, Battery C. Third Artillery,
beating him almost into insensibility and
robbing him of the few dollars in his pos
session. That they did not take his watch
toid strip him of his uniform was probably
due solely to the timely appearance of a
mounted patrol.
Fleck, who is stable sergeant of the
light artillery at the Presidio, was return
ing to his quarters at about 10:30 p.m.,
having spent the evening in town. His
route took him past the general hospital.
;u*t beyond which is a little Catholic
chapel 'standing a short distance back
from the road and partly screened by a
heavy growth of bushes and trees. Fleck
had hardly passed the open space in front
of the hoepital building when three
masked men sprang from the shadow of
these buFhes and peremptorily ordered
him to throw up his hands.
The sergeant was surprised, but his
army training was all against surrender-
Ing without a tight and he promptly let
Â£0 a vicious right at the nearest robber.
If the blow had landed there might have
been a different story to tell, but it didn't.
The robber dodged and before Fleck could
recover his balance he received a terrible
smash with a pair of brass knuckles on
his left optic that *ent him to the ground.
As he struggled to his feet dazed but
jilucky another blow caught him behind
the Â«ar, and then it seemed as though all
three of his assailants were hitting him
at the same time. Fleck had no chance
against such odds, and he was soon placed
hors de combat.
The unequal battle had been fought In
silence after the first salutation by the
footpads, but just as the thrÂ«e robbers
Â¦were hastily going through their prostrate
victim the hoofbeats of a galloping horse
were heard and the next moment a
mounted patrol appeared around a bend
in the road. The robbers dove into the
bushes and made their escape. They se
cured between $7 and Â£8 in coin., but were
frightened away before they had located
the battered sergeant* watch.
Fleck was badly beaten about the head.
a deep cut under his left eye showing
whore the first blow landed. He refused
to bo to the hospital for treatment and
made no report of the affair until yester
day morning, when he informed his bat
tery commander. Captain Califf.
"If I had had a revolver there would
have bwn some fun," said Sergeant
- Fleck yesterday. The robbers exhibited
no firearms, probably fearing to take
chances in using such noisy weapons in
the midst of an armed camp.

CASE DISMISSED IN COURT
AMY MUBPHY'S TRAGIC DEATH
WILL GO UNAVENGED.
The final scene in the tragedy of pretty
Amy Murphy's death was enacted in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday morning,
when Horace L.. Poulin, the man who was
morally responsible for her self-destruo
tion, was given his liberty, as the Jaw
was powerless to punish him.
The courtroom was crowded and among
the spectators were a number of young
girls, attracted by morbid curiosity. They
craned their necks to get a glimpse of
Pculin, and when he left the courtroom
they followed him along the City Hall
corridor and out- into the street.
Mrs. J. C. Dart, the dead girl's mother,
was early on the scene prepared to swear
to a complaint against Poulin, but after
consultation with District Attorney Hy
ington the conclusion was reached that
there was nothing in the Penal Code un
der which Poulin could be charged. Mrs.
Dart was considerably chagrined and did
not wait to hear the proceedings in court.
Before leaving she was given the articles
belonging to Amy found by the police in
Poulin's room.
AVhen the case was called ex-Judge
Pierce of Los Angeles, who represented
Poulin, asked if any complaint had been
Hied. Prosecuting Attorney Harris replied
in the negative. Poulin had been standing
in the rear of the courtroom and was or
dered to step forward. As he did so he
was the cynosure of all eyes. Pierce then
asked that the case be stricken from the
calendar and the bail of $1000 exonerated.
Warrant Clerk Peery said that however
desirable from a moral standpoint It might
be necessary to punish the defendant,
there was no law to cover the case and
he had refused to issue a complaint.
Judge Mogan said he had to rely upon
the judgment of the warrant clerk, and
as there was no evidence before him and
no complaint there was only one course
left to himâ to order the case stricken
from the calendar and the bail exonerated.
Poulin left the courtroom with his attor
ney, followed by a crowd of young men
and women, and the curtain was rung
down on the final act of the tragedy of
misguided Amy Murphy.

great.
As expected, reference was made to the
splendid triumph which the Republican
party has won in defeating machine poli
ticians and electing to the Federal Senate
a man whose record Is his pledge of an
honorable future, whose abilities have
stood the test of experience and whose
character Is absolutely above reproach.
And in the congratulation which has fol
lowed this triumph the Independent press
of this city received its : meed of praise
for its fearlessness and for its uncompro
mising attacks upon what it conceived to
be error. In the addresses of the evening
no theme evoked heartier enthusiasm and
no discussion â¢ called for 'more generous
marks of approval than that which found
in the election of Senator. Bard a solidifi
cation* of the Republican . party In this
State and the reconciliation of its conflict
ing elements in preparation for. the great
battle which must.be fought and/won in
the. coming months of this year.
When' Senator Bard and his escort Â¦ had
been seated George .Clark, second vice
president of the-Union League. Club, arcse
to deliver the address of welcome. He
spoke but briefly. " It was hla pleasure/he
said, to /welcome Benator.Bard to the hos
pitality, of .. the Union League .Club and .to
the presence of Republicans from all parts
feeling toward me; and it gives me great
encouragement as I ta*e upon me the re
sponsibilities of the office to which I have
recently been elected by .he Republican
members of the Legislature of this State.
. "Friends, I thank you. I will not detain
you, but I accept this as a very great
privilege that has been granted me by
this club to greet you and grasp you by
the hand."
Again the Senator received the tribute
of applause and as he took his seat the
master of ceremonies introduced Governor
Gage, saying that the incident of intro
duction was to him a most unexpected
honor as he did not expect the Governor
to be present and had no thought that
he would speak. The address Vf the Gov
ernor was but a few words longer than
that of .Senator Bard. His Excellency
said that the State Legislature had per
formed a great duty well and he was glad
of it.
When he finished there were loud cries
for General Barnes. The call was so In
sistent that' the master of ceremonies
announced the orator as the next
speaker, and General Barnes ascended
the platform in a babel of cheers and
shouted word 3 of approval. His addrsss
was brilliant, sparkling In wit and elo
quence. He reviewed the contest which
had just closed, spoke kindly of thos*
and which has ended in the election of
Senator Bard, Colonel Jackson paid a
tribute to the part played by the press of
this city in the fight. -In- this regard he
spoke as follows:
"The exercises of this hour would be in
complete and fail of their moral effect -if
we did not recognize one of the greatest
agencies of this great success of the Re
publican party of Californiaâ the 'gigantic
power of the metropolitan press of this
city. We haveall personal knowledge how
in the. daytime it has issued its maledic
tions and in. the night time has hurled its
anathemas against everything it thought
to be in the line of error, or not in the
best Interests of this people. -
"It has > succeeded in sinking its
personal differences to bring ._ about
the condition, at which we rejoic*
to-night. - The metropolitan . press has
given 'the text for the country press and
the country prees has followed with a
unanimity. that is wonderful in California.
Therefore, to the press we must pay our
respects, and I think it will bea pleasure
to you. to, hear from the dean of the guild,
who is representing one of the newspapers
of this city, that have done so "much to
bring this result about."
- At > the conclusion of Colonel . Jackson's
address, ! M.": H. de Young was introduced
and r spoke briefly. He declared- that" the
press : had ; done : what 'it conceived ', to", be
its Â»diity\ to v the people 'of California,-, and
he : felt 'assured that the worthy citizens
'or the entire State Joined' with. the. Union
League Club in congratulation over the
election of a man worthy to represent
California in the United States Senate.
Great questions demand now a national
solution, and the .Republican administra
tion at Washington needs earnest and
persistent support for the policy which
means so much to the people, of the
United States. It Is well, therefore, he
said, that California has now a complete
representation in the upper house of the
National Legislature. The speaker then
outlined what he believes to be the great
questions, with which the nation is con
cerned and in the solution of which Sena
tor Bard must take a part. Concluding,
he wished - Senator Bard the completest
measure of success. *
Colonel Jackson introduced the guest of
the evening." United States Senator
Thomas R. Bard, who was received with
every demonstration of enthusiasm. He
was applauded and cheered time after time,
and when silence was restored he spoke.
His address was brief in the extreme. He
confined himself solely to words of thanks
for the generous and hearty welcome
which he received. He spoke a? follows.
"Mr. Chairman and Fellow Republicans:
This greeting In the metropolis oi the
State, as warm and cordial as that which
I received ' at â¢my own ' home, gives evi
dence' to me that there prevails a kindly
of California.. Senator Bard, he continued,
already had won the well wishes of the
Republicans of the State, and beyond
question will soon command the good
opinion of men Independent' of party or
politics. It was an honor for the Union
League Club to welcome such a guest, as
sure him of the confidence of Its members
and tell of the hopes that go with him lor
the success of;hls future in the councils
of the nation. With 'these words; Mr.
Clark introduced Colonel J. P. Jackson,
Collector of the Port, as the master of
ceremonies for the evening.
Colonel Jackson spoke at length. He
paid an eloquent tribute to the moral
and mental qualities of Senator Bard,
which warrant , the high consideration
which he has received from the Legislar
ture of : California." The ' speaker devoted
considerable time : to Â¦ a discussion of the
great issues which are . now holding the
field of national politics.' He referred par
ticularly *to the . problem of expansion,
which , Is agitating the clearest minds â¢ of
the nation,. and he counseled the' Junior
Senator to ; remain , steadfast to ' the prin

UNITED STATES SENATOR
THOMAS R- BARD received last
night an ovation and a reception
which for their spontaneity and
expressions of good fellowship
and goodwill he will long remember. Un
der the direction of the Union League
Club of th!s city. Republicans and Demo
crats, citizens of the metropolis and of the
State, men of affairs and prominence in
every wÃlk of life, assembled to do him
honor and wish him success and reward
In the national field of politics to which
he haÂ£ been called. The great court of
the Palace Hotel was brilliantly illum
ined for the occasion. Masked behind the
palms an orchestra played stirring airs
and shortly after 7 o'clock the crowd be
gan, to rather. In a short while every
railery of the court, extending lax toward
the glass roof, was lined with eager spec
tators, who made a brilliant and an ex
pectant throng. Scores of men and women
moved about the court and In the gayly
adorned rooms of the Union League Club
there was excitement and activity.
At last the guest of the evening and
his escort arrix-ed from the Occidental
Hotel and a cheer greeted their appear

form, the throng following and cheering
as it went. It was the desire of all that
the exercises should be strictly Informal,
and while they took that form the guest
of the evening could not mistake the
heartiness and sincerity with which he
was welcomed.
In eloquent addresses men of national
as well as of State reputation paid lo
the newly elected Federal Senator their
tribute of praise for his personal worth,
assuring him of their confidence In his
Integrity and of his ability to meet the
serious duties of his high position. In
kindly admonition, he was urged to be
mindful of the vast Interests of the State
he represents. He was asked to give his
energies and add his strength of individ
ual Influence to the gTeat policy of thÂ»
Republican party.
In his election the speakers saw the so
lution of the vexing problem which for
over a year has disturbed the councils of
the Republican party in this State. In him
the orators found the happy answer to the
serious question of machine politics, and
through him will come to the young men
of the party an inspiration for action and
interest In affairs which deeply concern

A selling handicap at five furlongs which opened the sport went to the 7

now fighting for tho right to live against
the aggressions of. the other nations of
the world. We are fighting for our mar
kets, for the sale of our products, for the
expression of our national Ideals and or
our civilization upon the other nations of
the world. .
Again the hall rang with applause and
M. M. Estee was introduced. In a happy
vein. he discussed the incidents which
marked the contest for Senatorial honors
and the victory of Senator Bard, for
whom Mr. Estee expressed the best of
wishes and success in his new career In
national politics. Senator Bard, he said,
will have much to do, and it Is the hope
of Callfornians that he will do It well. He
will have the hard, persistent drudgery
of the committees, the constant care of
great Interests, the welfare of the people
of his State.
Among the, speakers of the evening few
created a deeper Impression than Irving
M. Scott, who drew from the election of
Senator Bard a lesson that was in the
thoughts of every man within sound of
his voice. He spoke of the triumph of
pure politics, of the victory Of manliness
and independence over subservience and
disreputahlllty. He praised the men of
the Legislature that had been true to the
pledges and to the obligations they owed
themselves and to their constituents.
He lauded the stalwarts who had been
proof against corrupting influences and
who had stood shoulder to shoulder until
their struggle for ; purity and decency in
public life had been rewarded by the
election- of a pure and able man to the
United States Senate.
"This victory .means to us," said Mr.
Scott, "that the machine In the politics of
this State has been destroyed. It means
that the young men of California are now
free to enter the field of political life and
In action which is legitimately their own
to retain their manhood and that inde
pendence.which is so essential to the life
and proper nourishment of our Govern
ment. These young men are soon to take
our places, for we cannot hope to remain
much longer jon the ' scene. They must
take up the burden where we lay It down
and It is a matter of the deepest and sln
cerest congratulation that in doing so they
will not have to bow to the machine."
Mr. Scott then turned to a discussion of
the national issues with which the Re
publican party is engaged, and he saw
nothing logical In the attitude of the na
tion except the development which ex
pansion suggests and to which In admo
nition and encouragement it points.
The last speaker of the night was Sam
uel M. Shortrldge, who spoke briefly but
spiritedly of the campaign which ended
in the election of Senator Bard.
Mr. Shortridge begged to add his words
of welcome and good will ta those that
had already been spoken and to assure
the newly elected Senator that In the good
wishes which will speed him on his way
to Washington there Is no thought of
sectionalism or selfishness, only the
hearty hopes of a united and Jubilant
party.
With these words the set speeches of
the night ended and the throng which
filled the apartments passed in review be
fore Senator Bard, grasping him by the
hand and with some word of good will on
their lips as they passed. Refreshments
were nerved and one of the heartiest and
slncerest receptions ever given by the Re
publicans of the city to a distinguished
member of their party waa over.

Kach one of us thought that he was the

Time and again the rooms rang with

better Judgment, and his time for the mile, l:39Vi, marks a superb performance,
the best, no doubt, ever made by a three-year-old with the weight up. Foster
& Hackett's big colt was installed favorite, with Brode the outsider. Opening
at 2 to 1, thousands were dumped into tJie ring on him until 3 to 2 was touched,

fumed as the boys haggled about, each endeavoring to get a shade the best of the
breakaway. Finally Burns on F. W. Brode rrnde tho start. th>> favorite at his
side, Bullman and Advance Guard .1 length back. Spencer had been told to use
his ov.n judgment, and he took Yellowtail down to the half in :49, trailed two
lengths back by Brode. Bullman hustling his mount over a length further
away. Reaching the :s)x furlongs in 1:11, Vellowlail was going easy, while the
two behind him were in distress.. Spencer gradually loosened his wraps, and
though hard pressed at the wire and his horse stopping badly, the ride was
timed to perfection and California triumphed over Canada and Kentucky.

AT WAR OVER
A FIELD DAY
\thlcttc Committees Fail to
Agree and Threaten Not
to Contest.
The intercollegiate' athletic committees
of Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia met yesterday afternoon in this
city to reconsider certain clauses of ihe
agreement entered into two weeks ago.
The subject discussed yesterday was the
place for holding the field day this year.
By the agreement Stanford was original
ly pelenrd. but California is desirous of
changing this and a split has resulted,
neither ;iarty showing any disposition to
accede 10 the demands of the other.
There wrre present yesterday E. J.
Ilrown. Clinton Muller and Jerry Muma
representing California. and David
Brown Track Manager CantwHl and Jo
neph Bernard of Stanford. The Browns
;ire trot hers ard th<y were the rival
Fpokesmcn lor the two collepcs. the other
representatives sitting bark in their
chairs; nodding or shaking their heads* to
tl>Â«* ex-cathedra annunciations of the two
chii mpions.
When the new Â«et of athletic laws wa?
drawn np by the athletic committee the
main d<=s:re was to do away with Kamos
ff ::'.l kinds In San Francisco. At the
Time this spemod thoroughly satisfactory
to all. hut California** representatives
have sirico developed a disposition to re
1>Â«1 against the selection of Palo Alto for
the place of holding The field day. They
<-laim thiit the track at Stanford is in no
way suited to a championship event and
Tha"t the. cinder path at California is the
host on the coast. "Stick to the agree
ment." said the Stanford representatives.
"\\> arc wiliin? to abide by it and so
Fhould California."
California wants the matter left to out-
Fide arliitration. but Stanford says no.
California threatens to draw out of the
agreement to hold tprins: athletic games
if their demands are rot conceded. The
is now at a. deadlock and will
undoubtedly call for tho interference of
The faculties before a settlement can he
reached.
NEW ORLEANS. Feb. 10.â Fortune
again, smiled on J. J. McCafferty when
Cathedral, the favorite, galloped home in
front of his field in the Clubhouse handi
cap. The Morris filly. Stripes, emerged
from the maiden class, beating Zack

other winning favorite.
The suspension of Jockey W. Woods

Fireman's Fund 8, Stanford 6.
One hour and forty minutes of baseball
agony was on parade at Recreation,
grounds yesterday afternoon, when thÂ«
Insurance men showed Stanford a 3econd
time that they were the latter's superiors
at the game. The score gives no Index
as to the game, which was covered with,
moth-eaten frlnga and In spots very
lumpy.
Both teams changed pitchers In thÂ©
middle of the game. Moore, a cardinal
freshman, being suplanted by Hampson,
another twlrler of the same, ardent class,
and Heine Krug giving way to Moskiman.
The change was needed and did the- spec
tators good.
In the third Inning something happened
to Moore and for a tlma there was a me
teoric shower of hits and a revelry in
fulsome errors. Webber. Moskiman.
Dunn. Butler. J. Hammond and Schmeer
coursed the bags for the insurance team,
and kept the scorer wearing out pencils.
Lougheed distinguished himself by com
mitting three successive breaches of base
ball etiquette in as many chances. Krug
was an easy mark for the Stanford men*
eight hits being secured off his delivery,
in four Inning?. The score;

who had Etrugrgled for the prize which
Senator Bard had taken away, and
pointed In eloquence to the future of the
State which the new Senator will repre-
Fent In Washington. General Barnes
fpoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman. Governor, Senator: Xo
citizen of California is hotter pleased than
I am that the question that agitated the
Legislature of this State during an entire
session â and which necessitated the call-
Ing together of that body In extra ses
sionâhas been finally settled. A gentle
man :-:.;Â¦! to me a.s 1 came in, 'I hardly ex
pected to see you here; 1 thought you
would fe#l kind of sore.' And 1 told him
that if i had the opportunity of address
ing him during the course of Ihe evening
I would have the pleaKure ot faying to
him and othrrs of his kind that there Is
not a sore s;>ot in my whole carcass.
"I have livÂ«*d to see and enjoy this mag
nificent development; and I have lived
to understand, too, what the enormous re
sponsibilities are to him who stands In
the uj>i>er House of th<* Congress of the
United States to represent this great
Western empireâ this great State of ours
to soon destined to become the central
point of Interest of the United States, the
mouth out of which shall How the rich
ness and wealth of the nation and go
prow up a power and a strength to other
nations as well.
% "You ar.d Iâ some of you grayhcaded
m<*n â can rememltpr when a few ships lay
at anchor in the bay; when once or twice
a month a (steamer loft this port and went
down to Panama bearing all we had to
send; and the same steamers came back
bringing all we wanted. To-day the har
i>or is alive with steamships; to-day your
tvharves are crowded with the product of
the State, with everything that can tend
to make life better to boar, with machin
rrr, with flour, with lumber, with fruit,
*ye, and 1 saw the other day that the
Empire of China was taking MclHn's
Food for Infants. (Great laughter.) And
when I know that our great mills
that make the lumber have already on
hand orders sufficiently large to keep
them busy for two years to come. Inde
pendent of the natural demands ot the
boll; when I know that our great machine
shops are burdened to the doors with ma
chines for the growth of commerce arm
!ife abroad, 1 am more than over satisfied
that the result of Dewey's victory at
Manila, the acquisition of the Philippine
Islands, was one foreordained of Provi
dence, that opened up the great East to
the power and the wealth and glory of
the United States.
â¢'Gentlemen, 1 do not wonder that there
are those who attack the policy of the
President of the United States. The great
family of the growlers and the knockers
exists in this generation as it has In every
other. George Washington had a thou
sand hammers out for him. Thomas Jef
ferson, when he achieved the purchase of
Louisiana, had a thousand more. When
Mr. Monroe took Florida and we had a
seven years' war to get the Semlnoles out
of the -swamps everybody attacked him.
When President Polk took In the territory
of Toxas and acquired the splendid land
where you now live he was bitterly at
tacked.
"When Seward took Into the great com
pany of the United States the territory
of Alaska he was lampooned and derided
from one end of the country to the other.
It would take a Quarter of a century
for the American people to learn to
appreciate the extent of the blessings
of that acquisition. The time will come
when the gentlemen who are now bo busy
assailing . the executive of the United
Statesâ some presidents of colleges, whose
opinion seems to be perverted Into a de
generate cowardice, assail himâ ten years
from now they will deny they ever said
It. or they will go down to history, with
the Atkinsons and the Hoars of politics.
"I came upon the stage, gentlemen, not
to inako a speech, but to say that I was

This association Is a representative body, coming from all parts of the city. It Is
to be presumed that If we carefully consider and report upon the various measures
proposed the Council. In finally submitting the matter to the" electors, and the
electors In voting thereon, will give attention to our recommendations.
This association cannot act intelligently, however, until Its committees have made
careful Investigation of the subjects referred to them and reported their recommenda
tions. You will please, therefore, take the matter up at your earliest convenience and
prepare written reports.
The Committee on Sewers will consider all of the above subjects numbered 1, 2, 3
and 4 Â¦
The Committee on "Water Supply will consider subjects 5 and S. , In that connec
tion they will give their views as to whether or not It .Is advisable for the city of
Oakland to raise money In the Immediate future by the Issuance of bonds, for the
purpose of purchasing an abundant supply of pure fresh water and the necessary
plant to collect and distribute ltr
The Committee on Streets will consider subjects 7 and 10.
The Committee on School Buildings and Sites will consider subject 8. *'
The Committee en Harbor and Harbor Improvement will consider subjects I and
Th<Â» City Hall Committee will consider subject 12.
The Committee on Fire Department will consider subject 13.
The president takes the liberty of adding to the above suggestions the follow
ing: MHPMMPVIMMfI
An taxpayers and representative men of the city, the members of each commltt
teÂ« should first take Into consideration whether, upon the whole, it is advisable for
the city to raise money to make the special improvements they are investigating
by- the Issuance of bonds.
Every year the accruing Interest on these bonds, together with one-fortieth of
the princloal must be paid.
Therefore. If the city Incurs a large bended indebtedness there will be a oon
sid*rable additional sum added to the bills for taxes each year. '
Tho people of this city will not vote in favor of increasing so materially their
burdens of taxation unles-s satisfied that a full equivalent will be received therefor.
H will be of no use, Â¦ therefore, to recommend to the voters the Issuance of bonds
unless the advantage to be derived therefrom Is made platnly to appear.
If after you have made an investigation, you are of the opinion that no. bonds
ought to be issued In order to raise money to -make the proposed Improvement,
your recommendation to that effect will, no doubt, receive the sanction of this asso
ciation, and will also receive the indorsement of. the people at the polls. 2aeaHÃÃHV>
But If you are satisfied that a full equivalent will be -obtained, for -the increased
taxation, then you should carefully, consider Just what the proposed Improvements
*hf!Il be. In order to make intelligent recommendations to us It may be necessary
for you to take the advice of expert* and consult with such persons interested in
tbÂ« matter as you may be able to meet.
This association haa no money with which to pay ' for the services of experts,
but no doubt you will find enough public-spirited citizens with -special knowledge
upon these Â¦ subjects which you are considering who will be willing to help you
with their, advice and suggestions.
We flo not know whether the Council will adopt our recommendations, but we
hope they will be so reasonable. and plain that they will not be rejected. Of course.
It is impossible to say whether or not the voters; at a special election will- indorse
what you or this association does, but it Is to be presumed, on account of the repre
sentative character of this body, that your recommendations. If Indorsed by the
General Committee, will have great weight with the people.
This adds to the responsibility of your position, and to the necessity of riving to
us wholesome advice that is the result of careful, investigation" and consideration.

SAYS LAWYERS
HAVE LOOTED
HER PROPERTY
Strong Accusation by
Aged Woman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Hg| HIS Broadway. Feb. 1!>.
In a suit commenced to-day against Pc
lice Justice Mortimer Smith and h:a
father, J. H. Smith, by Mrs. Mariana
Louis, the complainant makes several se
vere allegations against the professional
integrity of the two members of the Oak
land bar. She asserts that they have been
guilty of dishonorable tactics and hayÂ»
defrauded her out of a large sum of
money. The woman is SO years of age.
and declares that the lawyers against
whom she has started action took advan
tage of her enfeebled mental condition
and fleeced her.
In the bill of complaint Mrs. Louis says
that lons prior to December 22. ISOS. sha
Instituted contest proceedings against the
will of her deceased son, Edward Lou's,
in which she was represented by Attornf*y
A. Ruef. When the trial of the matter
occurred she was defeated, and then had
the Smiths substituted as her attorneys..
"In addition to the contest Mrs. Loul3
had pending against the estate of her son
a claim for $1&00. which was never dis
puted," declares the bill of complafr.t.
"This the executrix offered to pay, pro
viding that the efforts to break the will
were discontinued."
Mrs. Lo\ris says she would not agree to
this, and told Smith, father and son, to
appeal the will contest case to the higher
court. It was expressly stipulated, she
asserts, that they were to have no share
in the claim for $1500. She agreed to meet
all court costs and was to give the attor
neys half of whatever they might recover
In lieu of fees.
Then, on different occasions, Mrs. Louis
alleges In her x>Ul of complaint. J. H.
Smith told her that It was necessary to
have money to pay court expenses. On
December 22. IS9S. she gave him $160; on
March 30, 1523, $40, and on December 24.
1535. $40.
After getting all the money she had or
could borrow. Mrs. Louis avers that the
Lawyers Smith Induced her to believe that
she could not succeed In any of her pro
ceedings in the Probate Court, and it
would therefore be better for her to drop
the litigation and accept payment of her
claim for $LSOO against the estate of her
deceased son. They said that if she did
not do this, so she alleges, she would losa
everything. Â¦ 'Â¦
Mrs. Louis said that she was old. of
enfeebled mind and body and placed Im
plicit faith in her attorneys. Sh9 a^rÂ«Â»-n
to stop proceedings and accept the SISuO.
The Smiths secured the money and re
tained $7SO of it, which they are ehars^d
with embezzling. Altogether she accuses
them of getting and wrongfully retaining
$ICSO belonging to her.
She wants the defendants dcclarea
guilty of fraud in obtaining the money,
and asks that they be imprisoned in *;ia
County Jail until the judgment is satisSed
or they are sooner discharced by law.

OLD CAPITALIST
SEEKS ARREST
OF AN INFANT
John Gillam Bent on
Retaliation.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 10.â John Gillam. an
aped capitalist, made two unsuccessful
attempts to-day to have a tot of 6 years
prosecuted on a charge of malicious mis
chief. Justice of the Peace Morris first
refused to give Gillam a warrant for the
infant's arrest, and when he applied, to
the District Attorney's office in Oakland
he met with a second refusal.
The child is the son of Stephen J. Far
rell, 2326 Pacific avenue. Gillam and Far
rell had trouble over the pranks of the
child, who was accused of breaking win
dows with an airgun. As a result of the
difficulty Gillam was arrested for disturb
ing the peace. A Jury found him guilty
of the charge on Wednesday morning in
Justice Morris' court and he was fined $10.
Gillam is bent on retaliating for the
expense and notoriety he suffered. Yes
terday he swore to a complaint against
the cause of all the trouble for violating
a city ordinance which prohibits the dis
charge of airguns within the city limits.
The chap appeared at the police station
this morning to surrender his diminutive
person into the hands of the law's min
ions. His mother had to hold him In her
arms in order that the police sergeant
could take observations from behind the
counter of the station. The child, the
mother states. Is Just getting out of short
dresses. He pleaded not guilty before Re
corder St. Sure, who considered the arrest
of the child a? ridiculous and allowed him
to go without/ furnishing bail.
Then Gillam sought to have the little
fellow arrested for malicious mischief and
applied for a warrant at the Justices'
Court. Justice Morris would not listen to
Gillam's plea and told him to go to the
District Attorney's office and relate his
tale of woe there. Gillam followed the
advice, but met with another rebuff. The
District Attorney told" him a conviction
could not be secured on the strength of
his sad story and that he would not be
Justified in putting the county to needless
expense.
Gillam said this afternoon: "That boy
cost me 540, and I am going to get even.
The Judge fined me JlO, my lawyer
charged me $20 and other expenses cost
$10 more. I went over to the District At
torney's office and he said I ought not to
have the boy arrested. But this thing has
gone too far. I'm going to do something
to get even. They convicted me on per
jured evidence in the Justice's Court.
Farrell and his wife testified that I used
bad language, and that's not true, be
cause I don't swear at all. They are a
bad lot. I told them I would not prose
cute the boy for malicious mischief If
they would pay $2 50 for the window he
broke, but they didn't, and that's why I
wanted the warrant to-day."
John Gillam lives with his wife at 2355
Pacific avenue. He has considerable
means and is a capitalist by occupation.
He is frugal and places money wherever
it will bring the biggest interest.

Every person who Is a snfferer from nervous
ilseases should write the Yon Mohl Co^ Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, at once, and accept their oner
of a five days' trial treatment free of charge.
This is no O. O. D. or DEPOSIT scheme but a
liberal proposition made to unfortunate suf-
ferers by thi3 long-established concern, which
Is the largest importer of specifics for nervous
and sexual diseases in the world.
The Yon Mohl Co. has the sole American

vanced medical science that will positively

years been used as a specific In the French
and German armies, and since its introduc-
tion into the United States has cured many
thousands of sufferers, and the remarkable
success of the remedy in Europe has been re-
peated in this country.
In order to place this wonderful treatment
In the hands of every person who suffers the
mental and physical anguish of sexual weak-
ness. The Von"Mohl Co., has decided tosenda
free trial treatment to all who write at once.
The remedy is sent by mail in a plain pack-
ape, and there is no pu blicity in receiving it or

fect safety, and a sure cure is guaranteed.
Lost vitality creeps upon men unawares.
Do not deceive yourself or remain in igno-
rance while you arfe beinÂ£ dragged down by
this insidious disease. No matter what tho
cause may be, whether early abuses, excesses
or overwork and business cares, the results
are the sameâ premature loss of strength and
memory, emissions, impotency.varicocele and
shrunken parts. This spedflic remedy will
enre you at any stat;e before epilepsy results.
Â¦with cnsulns consumption and Insanity. "Cal-
thos" goes directly to the seat of tho trouble,
no matter of howlong stnndlnjr, and the pa-
tient feels the beneut of tho first day's treat-
ment. In five days the medicines sent frea
Â¦will make you feel like a new man.
The Yon Mohl Co. often receiTes the cost
astonishing testimonials from persons who

schemers, and when they had jriven up their
last hope for health and happiness. Nosen-
sible person will oenait hi* name to be- used
for a testimonial as an admission that ho baa

APPOINTMENT OF
MATRON TO BE
RECOMMENDED
The District Attorney
Favorable.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 10.
The ladies of the Oakland Club have
taken a great interest in the movement to
secure a matron for the County Jail, and
the matter is now in the hands of the
Supervisors. They will determine on Mon
day whether the labors of the ladles will
be of avail, for they will then decide
whether to create the position or not.
There is hardly any question as to the
desirability of the move. No one has de
nied that a matron was necessary in a
jail the size of Alameda County's jail, and
it has become a question only of whether
the Supervisors would create the position.
"I see no legal objection to the move,"
said District Attorney J. J. Allen, to
whom the matter has been referred, for a
legal opinion. "If I were a Supervisor 1
would not hesitate to make the appoint
ment. While there is no absolute provi
sion for the creation of the place, I believe
that^t could be made under the general
powers of the board for the good of the
C Â°When the position is created the ladles
feel that they should be consulted In the
appointment. They first called the atten
tion of the Supervisors to the necessity of
the move and they best have an idea as
to the needs of women. They have se
lected Mrs. Lina Rice and will urge the
Supervisors to appoint her. Mrs. Rice is
a widow, whose husband was Dr. S. H.
Rice of the United States Army. When
her husband was alive she took a great
interest in prison work and did mucn. of
her own choice, for the help of women in
trouble. She la thus fully prepared to as
sume the duties of the proposed position.
She has the support of the best men and
women in Oakland, and earnest efforts are
being made in her behalf.
The Associated Charities has placed it
self on record as supporting the Oakland
Club as follows:
Whereas The women of the Oakland Club
are making a vigorous effort to secure the ap
pointment of a matron for the County Jail;
therefore, be it
Resolved by us. the committee on co-opera
tion of the Associated Charities. That we ex
press our hearty sympathy in thi.Â« undertaking
and offer our active support. John Bake well.

Thirdâ That the Federal Government should
build storase reservoirs to save the flood waters
that are now wasted and should, wherever nec
eMary, build the Irrigation works required for
the reclamation aad settlement of the arid
public lands: and
Whew*. The foregoing policy Is advocated
by Xii-i !.'Uional Irrigation Association as em
bodied in Its constitution, and the object of said
association Is to bring about Its adoption by the
Federal Government: now, therefore, be It fur
ther
Resolvrfl. That we believe it would bt enor

MANY VALUABLE
DOGS POISONED
IN BERKELEY
Thirty-One Killed in
as Many Days.
BERKELEY. Feb. 10.â Within the past
month fully thirty valuable dogs belong
ing to prominent Berkeley people have
been poisoned in the most mysterious
manner. No one seems able to give a
good account of the poisoning though
many theories plausible and otherwise
are offered.
About January 1 the first case was re
ported to the police. The dog belonged
to a party in South Berkeley. No reason
could be given for the canine's mysteri
ous death. For several days other com
plaints came from the same district.
Then the poisoner changed operations to
the foothill distriot. A few days' rest
and complaints would come from other
parts of the college town. The work was
done in the night and all tracks hidden
so carefully that Marshal Lloyd and his
deputies are at a loss what to do.
Preliminary to another crusade anony
mous postal cards have been sent out
warning owners of dogs of the impend
ing danger. The postals have had the
effect or keeping all canines under lock
and key. Only the most valuable and in
many cases very quiet dogs have been
picked out.
Joseph Hume of Dwight way was one
of the earliest victims to the poisoning.
He lost a thoroughbred St. Bernard dog
which was a great pet of the neighbor
hood.
Besides the reward offered by Mr. Hume
and others special policemen have been
detailed to run the criminal down. So
far, however, little has been accom
plished.
The Marshal's officers in their work
have discovered several very important
facts concerning the poisoning. In one
of the best districts or Berkeley the offi
cers have found crystallized strychnine
in an old newspaper which had
been thrown into a yard. Liver and
onions soaked with the poison were also
found. Both the strychnine and meat
have been traced to a certain house In
Berkeley, but as no positive proof can
be secured no arrests can be made. The
guilty one must be detected in the act
of poisoning' or throwing the poison be
fore evidence enough to convict him can
be secured. Among those whose dogs
have been poisoned are: Mrs. Spaulding,
2233 Ellsworth; William Kelley, 2239 Ban
croft; Charles A. Prlngle. 2222 Bancroft;
Mrs. Foster. 2239 Charming; Phi Gamma
Delta, 222S Dana; Mrs. Baird, 2624 Ban
croft; Mrs. Reed. 2529 Durant; Mrs.
Ricard, 2720 Bancroft; Mrs. Morehardt,

The musical lecture given last Monday
night by Grand Receiver Booth was In
that well-known entertainer's best vein,
and It was greatly appreciated.
Franklin Lodge on the night of the 2d
inst. initiated two candidates, the work
being done by C. E. Walter, the new mas
ter workman, probably the youngest who
has ever held that office, he having just
turned '21. He did his work well and was
assisted by Deputy Curtis in the secret
work. The lodge elected Will J. Beatty
as its delegate to the Grand Lodge.
Tiie McCurrte family, which was here
for a long time, sick and in distress, and
was assisted by the local membership,
was sent back to its home in Grand
Rapids, Mich., with the assistance of the
officers of the order.
The Druids.
Last Monday James F. Martinonl, the
noble grand arfh, and John M. Graves,
the grand secretary, paid an official visit
to Salinas Grove, on which occasion there
were two initiations and two applications
were read. The grand officers Imparted
instruction in the work and also addressed
the membership, after which there was a
banquet, at wnioh there were responses
to toasts by the visiting officials and near
ly every member of the grove. A feature
of the "banquet was the introduction of
"Salinas cigars' having T. D. wrappers.
These "cigars" are T. D. pipes and the
filler? finely chopped smoking tobacco. On
Tuesday the grand officers went to Gold
tree station by rail, where A. Sciaroni of
("ayucos Grove, as a committee of one,
drove them in his carriage to Cayucos,
fourteen miles distant, which they
reached at a quarter after 8 o'clock in the
evening, and they went to Cayucos Grove,
where nearly the entire membership
awaited their arrival. Two candidates
were initiated and the third degree was
conferred on one. The work was done
with great precision and It excited a great
deal of enthusiasm. After a few remarks
on the condition of the order there was an
adjournment to the Exchange Hotel,
whore C. Ghezzi, a member of the grove,
had prepared an excellent supper in the
dining-room, which had been tastefully
decorated with Mags, flowers and ever
greens. The wives and lady relatives of
members were present and a most enjoy
able time was had. Two chairs decorated
with flowers and evergreens were special
ly reserved for the guests of honor. Past
Arch R. Tonini was the toastmaster. and
by calling on the visitors and others for
responses he managed to keep the assem
blage together until half-past 2 in the
morning. By courtesy of Mrs. P. Dughi
the visiting officers were sent by carriage
to San Luis Obispo, which they reached
on the "th. and there visited Mission
Grove of that place. The membership re
ceived them with great cordiality. The
officers instructed them in the work and
talked to then so as to encourage them
to "work heart and soul for Druldism."
During the evening there were a number
of responses to calls for remarks, and
when the grove closed the members as
one said they were conrinced by. what
they had heard during the evening that,
as is expressed by the precept of the or
der, it is "good to live in unity, peace and
concord." The grand officers will continue
their visits, and to-morrow, the 12th, and
on Wednesday and Thursday they will be
in Los Angeles., when they will visit Los
Angeles, Morton and Mazzir.i" groves. On
the ICth they will be with Summer Grove
in Kern City: on the 17th they will be
with Merced Grove, and on the 19th with
the grove in Modesto, after which they
will return to this city.
Last Thursday night Manzanita Grove
added five more strangers to its member
ship by Initiation and the grove has still
nineteen more to receive, which will in
crease the roll to ninety-six. This grove
will confer the second and third degrees
in the amplified form as soon as the team
that has been organized for that purpose
shall have been fully costumed and the
members composing It are perfect In the
work. The degree on the new member
was conferred by Past Grand Arch H. J.
GoUf r, assisted by J. J. Mollison. P. X. A.
Volta Grove will give a social In Wash
ington-square Hall this evening under the
direction of the committee on entertain
ment, consisting of L. P. Costa, G. Raggi,
L. Pastorlno. A. Costa and G. Mlcheli.

there was a very enjoyable time, as there
was presented a programme of entertain

Parlor Xo. 89 was officially visited by
Grand First Vice President Mrs. Ema
Gett. Past Grand Presidents Mrs. Mary
E. Tillmann, Mrs. Belle W. Conrad an<i

of Buena Vista Parlor. Miss Emma Hilke
of Joaquin Parlor. Mrs. Brown of Pied
mont Parlor. Miss Lizzie Douglass, past
grand treasurer; Miss Sabin and Miss
Mamie Richter of Alta Parlor. The visit
was a' surprise, as It had not been an
nounced, but the very capable officers
were equal to the occasion and exempli
fied the work of initiation in a most satis
factory manner, as they were all letter
perfect in the ritualistic and secret work,
while the floor work was without flaw.
The grand officers congratulated the of
ficers of the star parlor for their pro
ficiency, and added that they never dread
the visit of the high officials, as they are
always ready to perform well the 'parts
assigned to them.
La Estrella Parlor has arranged to give
a masquerade ball In Native Sons* Hall on
the night of the 14th Inst. In aid of the
190) fund. Some very handsome costumes
will be worn, and there is no doubt but
that the attendance will be even larger
than on the two previous masquerades
given by this very enterprising parlor.
Bonita Parlor JCo. 10 of Redwood City
gave another of Its minstrel entertain
ments In the Alhambra in that city last

that while in the chair he frequently had
â¢â¢jo consult with Erother Turpin in regard
to cases that were worthy of assistance,
and when his attention was called to a de
serving case he invariably gave me some
ruinâ not a small bitâ and told me: 'You
frive that to the party who needs it, but be
ture you nay, it asked who sent it. that it
was tent by an Odd Fellow. Above all.
do not mention my name." That is the
kind of an Odd Fellow he has been, ever
ready to assist, without any desire for
personal praise for his good acts." The
rew president has been spoken of as one
of the officers of the Grand Lodge, with
a view to making him in time the grand
master. It is a singular fact that the ini
tials of his name are the mystic initials
cf the order, which eignify friendship,
love and truth.

SPIRITUALISM.
ATTENTION!
Removed ! Removed !
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE,
The Greatest Medium
And Clalvoyant
On Earth.
Has Removed Her Offices to Her Residence,
1061 SEVENTH AVENUE,
EAST OAKLAND. Cal.
This celebrated medium, the clairvoyant of all
clairvoyants, who sees It all, tells you all and
Instantly gives you peace and happiness. She
never asks a question, but before you utter a
word she tells you In full of all that you are In-
terested m, all dates, facts, etc. She tells you
who are true to you and who are false, what
hopes you may have of winning your desires
and what obstacles are In your way and how
to remove them; how to make the best of your
talents and prosper; how to get money. She
finds lost articles and locates
HIDDEN TREASURE.
Before entering into business, law, divorce or
marriage, consult me. Drive away evil spells,
stumbling blocks, bad luck and habits and over-
come all evil works, rivals and enemies. She
never falls. She has brought about more happi-
ness than all other mediums. Others are helped,
why not you? If you are going to see a medium,
why not see the very best? It costs no more.
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE
Has no rival In her profession and stands with-
out an equal before the public. Thousands who
visited her and tested her wonderful power are
singing her praise throughout the land and is
Recognized by Press and Public Everywhere.
She tells you your complete past, your present
life, your entire future, of all loved ones, what
you should do to avoid trouble or disappoint-
ment how to recover lost or stolen property;
she changes misfortune into good luck, tells you
how your business transactions will turn out
and how to make them successful; she predicts
important events long before they happen; in
fact, there are no hidden mysteries so deep
that she cannot fathom.
Come all who suffer and be healed: come all
speculators and be advised: come all lovers and
win your idol; come all broken-hearted wives;
come all who are In trouble and learn to bless
this wonderful medium, the greatest prophetess
now In America.
Letters Come Pouring In
From all parts of the world. Involving ques-
tions of great import and complexity, and every
reply 1b most gratifying. To the troubled and
unhappy her advice Is soothing and beneficial,
giving them that peace of mind that wealth nor
power can produce. Men of the world consult
her upon matters of business and speculation;
sporting men upon games of chance. Even min-
isters of the Gospel send for her wonderful ad-
vice and marvel at her power.
Come all who suffer and be healed: come all
speculators ani be advised; come all lovers and
win your idol: come all broken-hearted wives;
come all who are In trouble and learn to bless
, this wonderful medium, the greatest prophetess
; now In America.
MRS. DR. A. D. HOWE
Should not be classed among the many cheap
pretenders who Infest the city and bring dis-
repute to the profession. Madame's parlors are
visited by business men of good repute, anxious
for reliable Information as to the outcome of
future Investments, and by ladies of high social
! standing.
Her parlors are bo arranged that one party
does not see another while waiting their turns
1 to consult the medium. She Is the only medium
on earth recognized by the profession as their.
Brightest Star.
Her power approaches the miraculous, and
she might well be termed the Witch of Endor
of the twentieth century.
To the Sick Especially
Her assistance is priceless. Her "Revealed
Medicines." registered and copyrighted, cure all
diseases on earth, consumption, paralysis, rheu-
matism, all akin diseases, heart and nervous
anectlons. The wonderful cures which she has
I made are the talk of the whole Slope.
If you cannot call, for thousands upon thou-
sands have been made rich, happy and healthy
without ever having come to see this wonderful
woman. Consultation by mall is always most
successful and satisfactory, and all correspond-
cnec is kept sacredly confidential.

Nay York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Ff b. 10.â The movement of
prices on the Stock Exchange had little sig- !
Rlfleanoe to-day, as o;>erations were largely
cor.f.ned to th" eloslr.g up of contracts by the
pro'Tsioral element. There was a continu
ing of rralizlns eal^s at the opening In spite of ;
the tranquillity with which the latest news j
fron South Africa nermed to be accepted by
the London ir:arket. The rally in the rrarket
after the bank *tat<Tr.Â«*nt Â«pr^arÂ«M made it
evident that part of the Belling had tieen for
*hort account In anticipation of an unfavor
able statement. The rally did not mean nec
ps.sarily that 'he statement was considered
favorable, but simply that the bears desired
to cover their short contracts' before the two!
holidays pending. There was rather acute j
weakness fit times in St. Paul. Missouri J'a- !
cjfic. Western Union. Burlington and Sugar. 1
The movement of prices was rather erratic. |
but the net changes on the <3ay are tmall and '
mixed with the BAjority on the side of losses, j
The doFir.g of the market was strong at a I
Â¦tally on the nhori coverlngr. As a matter of j
fact, opinion on the bank Ktatement was ccn-
' fused and j*ri'lexcd. The enormous loan ex- !
: .â¢Â»â¢,â¢ > r, caused an-.arement. In no single week j
during all of last year did the loan expansion
reach J16.0C0.C00. In the week endlnr February 1
4 lart year loans were increased $15.154,4!.Â« i. due
to the active fluctuation of new industrial com-
Mnatiorji then In full force. It compares
with d.lilMOO increase this week. Since Jan
uary 13 loans have been Increased $44.4JÂ«.500,
compared with an increase of $33,1Ji7,500 in the
corresponding rÂ«riod of last year, whea specu- i

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â The Financier says:
"The feature of the statement of the Associated
Banks of New York for the week ending Feb
ruary 10 Is the enormous expansion of $21,152,
400 in the loan acoount. The Increase over the
past fix days brings thÂ« total of loans well
upward of $721,000,000, a gain of $47,000,000 since
the closing of December. In the same period
cash holdings have been thirty-five and a half
millions, and deposits seventy-four and three
quarter millions above the total reported De
cember 31. It Is apparent, therefore, that the
banks have not weakened their position. Rather
they are stronger In every particular, but for
all this a continuance of the record-breaking
expansions, which are being reported now, will
have a very perceptible effect on cash. In
deed, the surplus reserve for the week just
ended declined almost $3,000,000 from the fact
that the net gain of $1,743,700 In cash did not
begin to meet the extra reserve requirements
of $4,717,400, necessitated by the raise of $18,-
J89,(>00 In deposits. The week's figures. It may
be stated, are In excess of anything reported
at this season last year, when stock exchange
transactions, both In current shares and bond
purchases, ran away ahead of what business
is now reported. The tremendous rise In loans
at this time Is somewhat difficult of explana
tion. The statement in detail shows that In
creases have been pretty well distributed over
the entire list of banks. The commercial paper
market la more acUve, but even taking this
fact and stock exchange business into consid
eration, the total expansion overruns the maxi
mum needs of both. It Is quite likely that
arrangements' completed for several large deals
pending contributed to the total gain. Ths
statement, showing as it does a decrease In
surplus reserve for the first time since Decem
ber 9, may be Interpreted to mean that money
rates will become firmer, if anything. Last
year the month of February witnessed a de
crease In reserve of $13,000,000 and the reserve
fell to $15,000,000 in April. It is not unlikely
that the same showing, but in a minor way,
will be witnessed this year.
Condition of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â To-day*! statement
of the condition of the Treasury shows: Avail
able cash balance, $296,760,074; gold reserve,
$120,242,479.
London Markets.
NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London* financial cablegram says:
The markets here opened dull on General Bui
lei's retirement from Va&l Krantz, but there
was a great recovery later, the market Inclin
ing to the view that the movements of General
Duller and General Mac Donald are Intended
chiefly to occupy the attention of the enemy.
Â»o as to facilitate the advance of the central
column directed by General Roberts. Consols
were steady at 1014.
Americans began a shade under parity and
then improved with the rest of the list, al
though most of them were lower on -balance.
The bank bought Â£11,000 gold In Scandinavian
coin and received Â£6000 from Australia. Silver
was 27 5-16.1. Short loans were in. leas demand
than yesterday, but loan* . for longer periods
are wanted! Bills were a shade firmer.

Steamer Movements.
It Is suggested that some of the deposit ac
counts which passed from the banks to the
newly organized trust companies during the
course of last year are now coming back to
ihe banks. There is nothing in the regular
c<nir*e of business or speculation to account for
the recent ereat extension In the loan Item of
the clearing-house hanks. Returns of bank
clearings by telegraph for five days to the
Financial Chronicle show a sharp falling off at
the four princi|.al Eastern cities and Increases
at Chicago and St. Louis in considerable pro
portion, while at New Orleans the Increase over
last year is nearly 46 i*t cent. The in
crease in the South is doubtless due largely to
tlje activity in the cotton market and is sug
gestive of the future demand upon New York
for funds from that section. But the clearing
house returns only serve to perplex the prob
lem of the phenomenal loan expansion of New
York banks.
The upward movement of prices, which found
its inception last week In the metal stocks,
broadenfd out this wfek. so as to embrace
pretty much the whole list of securities dealt
In on the New York exchange. By the middle
of the week the advance had apparently reach
ed its termination and on Wednesday afternoon
the bears succeeded In toppling over the over
extended long account of speculators with ln
sufilclcnt resources and a reactionary tendency
Bupervcned. Such reactionary tendency in
evitably discourages outside Interest in the
market and business fell back into the hands
of professional operators or large moneyed In
terests who have to do with the control and
detailed knowledge of the affairs of the great
corporations. The movement of the market
has b^en almoct wholly due to technical causes,
the general news of business being with but
few exceptions favorable and availing not a
little to maintain a firm undertone to the stock
market, even while it. showed weakness due
tÂ» the technical causes. The advance in prices
was viewed with more or less distrust, owing
to the palpable manipulation which, accom
panied it. Professional bull pools, known to
be long of stocks, were observed to be bid
ding up prices of their holdings In accord
ance with a -well recognized principle of ac
tion among professional operators.
It is one of the strongest propensities of hu
man nature to desire to possess something that
is eeÂ»n to be advancing In price. So that a
pool of stock operators, after buying thousands
1 of shares of a stock and then advancing the
price by bids for smaller amounts of stock.
j by successive stages, may tlnd sufficient de
' manri for the stock aroused among the outside
! public to absorb all the pool holdings at the
higher level. Needless to fay. such an opera
tion is assisted by any authentic sood news re
garding the particular stocks affected, or re
garding the general speculative prospect, as
well as by rumors and â¢"tips" itt good things to
roiw, thÂ» latter being even more effective with
a reckless class of speculators than the sober
and reliable bUFinefs facts... But, however true
the news may be which accompanies a rise, the
completion of the above described leaves a
market In a weakened condition technically.
Stocks hold by compact, well-organized pools,
with skill and money resources to buy up the
supplies offering and thus maintain the price
have passed to weak and scattering holders,
who have bought them with borrowed money on
a narrow margin and who have no resources
but to fell out when prices decline. Then comes
the bear operator in stocks, who sells large
blocks In a buoyant market and borrows them
for delivery until he has offered prices down
and wirxsl out the martin? of the unfortunate
speculation, forcing him to sell out at a lower
neure to the profit of the bear. The outside ln
t^rett aroused In the stock market early in the
weÂ»Â»k by the manipulated advance and the
favorable news developments was to consid
erable as to absorb the holdings of speculative
bull pools and alxo according to current report
and Indications some large holdings by bank-
Ing and lance financial Interests, which bought
stocks In the December panic at a level of ab
solute safety. Conservati\'e Interests of this
claj'H take a certain absolute safety. Conserva
tive Interests of this class take a certain profit
on such holdings rather than hold for further
rise on prospects of future value. The rather
violent collapse in prices of the midweek and
the steady stream of realizing later show con
clusively that a considerable portion of the
previous buying was for purely speculative ac
count by weaJc Interests. But In many stocks
there has be*n evidence of large *nd persistent
demand at all price levels touched, which is
good Indication of an absorption going on for
investment purposes. The motives of this kind
of buylnr wenÂ» several, including the declara
tion of new or Increased dividends, both on
railroad and industrial stocks; the high level
of earnings maintained by the railroads: the
large volume of their traffic In eplte of ad
vances of freight rates now In force, and the
prospect of advances to come In other classes
of freight, notably In bituminous coal. Plans
for consolidation of competing railroad systems
were also In process of completion. The nu
merous ramifications of the great Iron lndus
trl"Â« show a healthy tone for the future con
tracts, which are all that can be considered In
that business, owing to the full engagement of
1 resent capacities. Lhw bank clearings out
side th*Â» money centers of the East show the
continuance of general business activity above
la?t year's high level, notwithstanding the
falling off in purely speculative activity. The
high price and the active market for cotton
are believed to Insure future prosperous condi
tionH and demand for merchandise, and pro
ducts from a large portion of the country.
Money <-.ontinuÂ«*s easy, but the prospect of re
r.Â»wf.l absorption by the United States Treasury
in taking up the revenue surplus and the re
duced in-flow to New York, owing to the re
rfÂ»Â«J use of money for business In Interior
points. ailrnonlFhes to caution Inflation of cred
it? on unsound speculative issues.
The bu*!ne*s in bond* has been on a fairly
large soale and the tendency of prices has been
somewhat mix'-d. United States 3s advanced
4, the old 4s and Es >; and new 4s 4 In the bid
price.

SUNDAY. FEBRUARY It
CHICAGO, Feb. 10.â The center of Interest on
the Board of Trade was shifted to the Com pit,
that market being exceptionally strong and act
ive. May closing at %@?ic over yesterday, at
344 c. It was a sad session for short sellers in,
the Corn pit, for the coarse cereal, after an early
gain, on which traders confidently sold more
tnan they had bought, failed to follow Its usual
custom of reacting and climbed still higher.
Trade was active and the crowd greater than In
any other pit. The Influence of its strength
overspread \hs whole floor. The source of the
market's power was something of a problem.
An enormous shipping . business was claimed,
but New York reported only fifty boatloads
taken for export. The main Influence eeemed to
be the large purchases made by moneyed spec
ulators, whose actions were followed by a horde
of lesser Interests. Their maneuvers to fix a
higher price for the cereal which they are sup
posed to hold in good quantities was, â¢ at least
for the day, successful.
Wheat was firm, without being very active.
Better cables, due largely to smaller world's
shipments and the exceptional strength of Corn
were the influences. â¢ New Tork reported clx
loads taken for export, and seaboard clearances
in Wheat and Flour were 537,000 bushels. May

rpHERE is good promise of lively times
i in real estate circles during the re
' I mainder of the present month.
Â¦Â¦â¢ Brokers report a good January busi
ness, notwithstanding the fact that no
sales of special magnitude have been con
summated since the first of the year, and
February up to the present time has been
even better than the preceding month.
Several big deals which have been hang
ing fire for some time past are in a. fair
way of being closed within the next week
or two, and brokers are consequently in
high spirits. One deal In Market-street
realty involving nearly $200,000 has within
the past few days been practically closed
by A. M. Speck & Co., and although It
may be several weeks before the deeds are
signed and the details made public it can
safely be said that the bargain has been
made.
Referring to the condition of the real
estate market in San Francisco the San
Francisco Real Estate Circular, published
by Thomas Magee &. Sons, says in its is
sue for February:
"There was a temporary lull In the real
estate market so far as large transactions
were concerned in the first month of the
new year. There was a fair demand for
lots for flats inside of Gough and for
dwellings and flats worth $5000 to $10,000.
There is inquiry for investments between
Mission and Folsom, First and Steuart.
Land between Post, Turk, Taylor and
Leavenworth has been selling. The aver
age business therefore has been good,
even if no very large transactions were
consummated. The total number of sales
In January was 260 of the value of $3,045,-
ICB, against 233 sales in December aggre
gating $1,470,878."
The same publication also contains the
following, which will be of interest to tho
public:
- For five years previous to 1898 those who are
always pessimists pointed to the fact that five
or six old wholesale houses, mostly In the dry
goods trade, had gone out, of business and
had not been succeeded by any new firms.
This was said to leave the impression that
there never would again be any more pros
perity In wholesale business here. But the
present condition of wholesale business shows
that past dullness was only temporary. Never,
perhaps, in the history of Â¦ the city has that
branch of business been more prosperous.

CHILDREN AS DETECTIVES.
Bands of Mercy Members Help Hu-
mane Society Officers.
When the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals undertook to form
the bands of mercy in the public schools
It was not known that the project was
"loaded." The movement was started
by the lady members and they have met
with remarkable success .in organizing
bands in nearly all of the schools. They
also managed a very successful enter
tainment in Metropolitan Tempie and
from the proceeds bought 50,000 badges
and cards showing membership in the
bands. Following upon this the ladies
arranged for a series of lectures by prom
inent speakers in the parlors of the Oc
cidental Hotel. The iirst of these has
been delivered by Professor David Starr
Jordan and the next will be given in a
short time by Professor Montague of
Stanford. His subject is to be "The Im
mortality of Animals."
The organization of the bands has made
no end of work for the officers of the so
ciety. Every youngster wearing a badge
1b regarded In the light of a special de
tective and every day dozens of com
plaints are handed in to the office In the
Parrott building by the children. While
many of the reports are without special
merit, still there are not a few which
upon investigation by the older people re
sult in relief being afforded dumb ani
mals. As a fact a man cannot now abuse
an animal with any assurance that his
act will not be reported at the office,
as every other child in the block is an
agent of the society. That the younger
peneration is rapidly being educated in
the line of kindness to all dumb creatures
Is now an established fact. Such was the
report made by Mrs. C. B. Holbrook,
president of the ladies' department of the
society, at the first annual meeting yes
terday. At that gathering Mrs. Hol
brook was again selected to preside; Mrs.
Amy Waters was elected secretary and
Mrs. S. H. Whiting as treasurer.

The following resolution was proposed
and unanimously passed:
Resolved. That this meeting recognizes the
importance of encouraging the study of music
In Pan Francisco: that the sense of this meet-
Ins is that Its object can be best realized by
the organization of a society for the practice
and renderlns of the best oratorio and choral
music.
After the passage of the resolution Her
mann Ger.ss was appointed musical di
rector and Mrs. L. J. Murdock accompa
nist. A committee to select and perma
nently decide on a name for the society
was arpointed, consisting of Mrs. W. C.
Stadtfeld, Miss Brauntsch and Mrs. G.
H asset t. Another committee, consisting
of Dr. Max Magnus. Mrs. Warren Greg
ory and W. C. Stadtfeld, was also ap
pointed to draft a constitution for the new
organization.
This concluded Friday's business, and
on motion of W. A. Murrison, who acted
as temporary chairman, the meeting ad
journed to convene again on next Fri
day afternoon. â¢
MEETING TO FORM A
NEW MUSICAL SOCIETY
There was a meeting of musical people
Jn the parlors of the Occidental Hotel
Friday afternoon, the purpose of which
â¢was to form a new society for the encour
egement of oratorical music with vocal
and instrumental accompaniment. The
new society will be formed out of a fusion
of the- Apollo Club and the Handel and
Haydn Society. The name of the new so
ciety will probably be "The San Francisco

not long since moved from a very small three
etory buildinp on Sansome etreet to a corner
80x85, on which they occupy a five-story build
ing. Miller, Slobs & Scott, hardware dealers,
are building on their own lot, 137:6 feet square,
a very flne five or six story bulldlnc, on Mis
sion and Fremont. Dunham, Carrlpan & Co.
are about to enlarge their premises nearly
double on Beale street. The wholesale grocery
house of H. Levl & Co. about a year ago
moved into premises on the north side of Mar
ket street, below Dnimm, with a frontage of
60 feet on Market, running back with a depth
of about 200 feet to Sacramento street, on
which they front about 185 feet; the building
Is four-etory on Market. The wire goods house
of Roebllng & Co. Is about to double the size
of its premises. Blake, Moffltt & Towne. whole
sale paper dealers, moved - not long since into
premises on First street, below Market, about
three times the size of their old quarters on
Sacramento Â»treet. These are only â¢ a few of
the changes and enlargements ofÂ»old business
firms that occur to us. Many more could be
recited. If we were to give time and more ex
tended observation- to the matter. For five or
six years prior to 1898 wholesale property was
quite unsalable; now it is in good demand.
Benjamin M. Gunn & Co. have sold to
J. P. Lloyd two pieces of property ad
joining the block bounded by Brannan,

are the lot on the northerly corner of
Bryant and Fremont streets, 275x137:6. for
which he paid the estate of S. A. English
$50,000, and the westerly corner of the

Fourth to East street. This would makÂ«
the roadway 43% feet and the sidewalks
17 feet Instead of 19 feetâ a very desirable
change if the cost Is not too great and
If the funds can be provided for it In the
next tax levy. The street needs repaying
badly, and this will be asked for at the
same time, as well as a slight modifica
tion of the grade where the street haa
sunk somewhat."
Thomas M agree & Sons' Circular says:
"There Is no demand for money by bor
rowers for real estate use. All of ths
banks lend for 6 per cent gross, say 4.3",

buy or build. When real estate stirs vrg
more there will bÂ© a much heavier de
