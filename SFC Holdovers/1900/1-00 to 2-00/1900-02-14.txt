I iald I never had met him. Esola was
ent for and we were introduced. I was
favorably impressed by him. I told Law
rence that I would be glad to vote for his
friend If his qualifications were as repre
sented, but I added, "Mr. Lawrence, the
man I vote for for Chief must be a man
that I can back with my honor."
That afternoon for the first time I called
on Mayor Phelan. I did not then, nor
ever before, ask him for the position of
Police Commissioner. He already knew
that Mr. Lawrence had selected me. I
told the Mayor that I much preferred the
Commission of Public Works, but that I
would accept the Police Commission as
tendered.
Mr. Phelan then said he was very glad
to have me on the board. He spoke fur
ther about the importance of the duties
of the office, and I replied that I under
stood that and that I would perform those
duties, fearlessly, conscientiously and ag
gressively if Â¦ necessary, and that if my
father came from his grave he could not
influence me to depart from the path of
duty.
I used these very words. Mr. Phelan
apparently did not believe then that I
meant , what I said. He probably does
now. , He then gave me the card of a
gentleman whom he desired to have ap
pointed to a position under the board and
asked me to bring the matter to the no
tice of the other Commissioners, saying
he proposed to make me his personal rep
resentative In such matters.
Mr. Phelan repeatedly tried to Influence
me to vote for Esola after the Investiga
tion was concluded, but I steadily refused
on the ground that Esola was unfit and
Incompetent, and on the further ground
that Esola had committed deliberate per
jury 1 in his testimony before the commis
sion when *he stated that he could not
remember being present at the meeting
when the Commissioners called at the
Mayor's office Sunday, January 7, 1900,
and ' there met Mr. Lawrence, tho Mayor
and Esola.
When I referred to Esola's perjury as a
matter known to the Mayor and all of the
commission., personally, Mayor Phelan
made excuses for him and said Esola so
testified. In order "to shield the commis
sion." j This was in Mayor Phelan's office
on Monday afternoon, January 22. 1900, the
Esola Investigation having been completed
the previous Saturday night.- .-".' ;
I repeat It, Mayor Phelan himself per
sonally excused Esola's perjury to me. and
again and again urged me to vote for
Esola. I always rofused.
This Is the true and only cause of . my
removal, j Conscious of my own upright
ness of purpose, I leave Jt to the people
of San Francisco to say whether that ro
moval is a disgrace to me or to Mayor
Phelan. I repeatedly stated In the publ'c
prints . that I would cheerfully vote for
Colonel: William P. Sullivan or any other
good man whom the Mayor might recom
mend for Chief of Police. I only refused
to vote for Esola.
And It Â¦ was â¢my refusal so to vote and
my refusal to allow my position on the
Esola trial to be misrepresented by the
Examiner that led to the expose and over
throw of . this monstrous conspiracy to
turn the Police Department of San Fran
cisco over to bad, incompetent and un
worthy hands.
âsola is defeated and the men behind
him are defeated. I am content.' I have
done my duty. I shall not seek by an ap
peal to the courts to be restored to a po- 1 '
sitlon which has no attractions for me.
I could not afford to abandon my post and
allow 'the conspirators to triumph by the
appointment of a servile tool In my place.
Now. that the conspiracy is defeated I am
content to return to the private station.
The rectitude of my intentions and my
conduct I leave *to the determination of
my - fellow-citizens. No Judgment of a
court- is â¢ necessary to prove that Mayor
Phelan bargained away the Police De
partment, to . the managing editor of the
Examiner and that the combination made
a -mistake in choosing* me as an instru
ment to do . their nefarious work, or to
prove , that I was , removed from office Il
legally,, unjustly and ."arbitrarily upon
charges based upon falsehood and without
a: trial. - ; W: J. BIGGY.
Â£:Â±piins afternoon between "5 and 6
o'clock I received a brief note
I from the Mayor notifying me that
)^ I had been removed from the office
of Police Commissioner "for the
causes specified in a communication of
this date to the Board of Supervisors."
No copy of the communication was fur
nished me. The ofllce of the board was
then closed and I could not see the com
munication. I learned of the alleged
cause at a late hour to-night, through
other sources. I deem It due to the pub
lic as well as to myself to reply to the
charges without delay and as fully as "the
lateness of the hour permits.
The charges are a mere pretext. The
real reason for my removal is that I
defeated and overthrew the conspiracy
between Mayor James D. Phelan and An
drew M. Lawrence, the managing editor
of the Examiner, to make Frederick L.
Esola Chief of Police of San Francisco.
It was to revenge himself upon me for
exposing his infamous bargain, which, If
carried out, would, have put a bad and
incompetent man fn ofllce for purposes
which the other newspapers have al
ready made plain.
The first charge is that I made It impos
sible for the board to hold executive ses
sions. This Is absolutely false. The board
has held two executive sessions since the
meeting of January 26, IPOO, referred to by
the Mayor, at which all the Commission
ers were present. I never revealed any
of the transactions of any of the execu
tive sessions, except the single matter of
my stand on the Esola trial, and that this
was Justified I think was amply demon
strated in my communications published
in The Call and Chronicle January 27,
1900. I will not go over that discussion
again now. I could not allow the commis
sion to tie my hands and tongue and mis
represent my position.
Messrs. Thomas and MoNutt wanted to
keep the fact dark that they were pledged
to Esola and meant to stand by the
pledge. I had been represented by the
Examiner as having- found Esola as not
guilty on all the charges and as having
found him to be competent and fit to fill
the position of Chief. This was not true,
and I had to set myself right. After that
expose in the papers of January 27 the
commission met Monday, January 29, and
not a word of criticism nor comment was
made by the board or any member upon
my conduct in that matter.
Subsequently, at the meeting of January
SO, Mr. Thomas introduced " his resolution
to remove me from the position of ictlng
Chief, and when Mr. -Newhall refused. to
support it Mr. Thomas then for the first
time made complaint about my published
statement of the real situation of . the
Esola affair. H<Â» then had already re
signed, though his resignation had not
been, accepted. He further stated that
that resolution to remove me from tho po
sition of acting Chief was urged upon him
by Mayor Phelan personally, as a meas
ure to pave the way for my removal from
the commission. â¢.;>â¢
It is not true that the commission n-'
fused to sit In executive session with me.
It is not true that the other three Com
missioners Informed me that, when execu
tive sessions were they would sit
by themselves without me.
It Is true that I revealed In the public
press and over my signature on January
27, 1900, certain of the proceedings of the
board relative to the Esola affair. It is
true that I asked permission of the board
so to do, which was denied. But I leave
It to the public to decide whether as an
honest man and a man of honor any other
course on the faits as they were was
open to me. â¢
The Examiner had totally misrepresent
ed the nature of the verdict of the com
mission on Esola. Two of the commission
wanted to keep their position secret,' but
I refused to allow myself to be bound
hand and foot and misrepresented with
out a protest.
The Mayor says that he was Informed
by- the three other Commissioners that
my published statement was untrue. He
does not point out in what particular it
was untrue. I doubt whether Â¦ his state
ment is truft that he was so Informed. â¢ I
Know that my, statement was absolutely
tlon. Biggy announced that he was ready
to vote for Colonel Sullivan. So much for
that "reason" submitted by the Mayor.
It means that his Honor, enraged at the
failure of a shameful conspiracy, had deÂ»
termined to punish the man who had de
feated his plans.
But Pbelan has not yet exhausted his
resources of artifice and misrepresenta
tion. He declares that Biggy had madg
it Impossible for the Police Commission to
hold executive sessions; that the other
Commissioners had complained to tha
Mayor because of Blggy's alleged viola
tion of secret session promises and re
fused to sit with him any longer; that to
correct these abuses and to prevent the
commission from being reduced to three
members Biggy had to be removed. These
"reasons" have no more and no less a
value than the others already given.
Biggy insisted once upon defending him
self from a gross misrepresentation of his
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
SOME statements fn Mayor Phelan's notification to the Board of
Supervisors that he had ousted Police Commissioner Biggy axe so at
variance with . the facts that they cannot be passed without contra
diction. As some of them concern the actions of Police Commissioner
Newhall they were called to that gentleman's attention last night by The
Call. He was asked:
Q. â Did you complain to Mr. Phelan, as he stated In his noti
fication to the Supervisors of the ousting of Mr. Biggy, about Mr.
Biggy giving out the secrets of the executive session?
A. â I made no complaint whatever.
Q. â Did you tell the Mayor, as he has stated, that you had
informed Mr. Biggy that you would not sit with him any more- in
executive session?
A.â My answer to that question is that I have always sat
in open and executivo session with every member of the commis
sion. I did not inform Mr. Biggy that I would not sit with him.
Q.â Did you tell the Mayor that the statement issued by
Mr. Biggy regarding the compromise report on Lieutenant Esola
was not only, unauthorized but untrue?
- v A.â l did not say so in so many words. I told him that
we all agreed to sign the report.
may deem beneficial to public Interest."
This authority applied to the Police
Commissioners as Mayor Phelan under
stands their duties may be very clearly
stated. His Honor had entered Into a
criminal ante-election compact to -deliver
the Police Department of this city to the
manager of a local newspaper In ex
change for the support of that news
paper. One of the terms of this com
pact was that Frederick Lawrence Esola,
alias Harrington," "a notorious
tent, was to be elected Chief of Police
and that Jules J. Callundan. alias Worth
ington. a blackleg, was to be elected
chief of detectives.
' The Mayor considered these elections as
"beneficial to public interest," and not
only recommended them but demanded
them. Biggy rebelled. He declared that
he was willing to vote for any man of the
Mayor's choosing on .condition that the
candidate was a decent man. That is the
explanation of the Mayor's first reason
for removing William J. Biggy.
But his Honor is not at a loss for rea
sons. He says that he found It necessary
to remove Biggy lri order to restore the
efficiency of the Police Department, which
had been seriously disturbed by Internal
dissensions in the Board of Police Com
missioners. The Mayor rightly considers
that Biggy was an obstacle;- but so wad
George A. : Newhall, who stood manfully
in opposition to the Mayor's indecent pro
posal. The public Is very familiar with
the character of those dissensions. New
hall and Biggy positively refused to lift
the Mayor's bemired favorite Into the
chair of the Chief of Police. William
Thomas resigned rather than tar himself
with the Mayor's brush, and to escape
from ' the odious pledge which he had
given to obey his Honor.
The Phelan pill had not only been bitter,
but it was poisonous, and the stomach of
Mr. Thomas rebelled. The only chattel
of the Mayor on the board was Dr. Mc-
Nutt.
That was the dissension which the Mayor
says he cleared away by removing Biggy.
His Honor's friends should advise him
that the first le3son in false logic la not
the statement of a He. It avails him
nothing to assert something which the
people of this city know to be untrue. It
was he and not Biggy who was the
breeder of dissension In the Police Com
mission. It was the Mayor who made
dissension and divided the commission
against Itself by demanding a dishonor
able act. His Honor should take his les
sons in private morality and public honor
froir other sources than the Eaolas of the
city.
He knows as well as every reader of a
newspaper knows that when his scheme,
dishonorable as it was, had failed that
Biggy and Newhall stood ready to vote
for Colonel Sullivan as Chief bf Police or
for any other reputable man if the Mayor
had another on his list. The dissension
In the Police Commission had ended when
the Mayor withdrew his discredited creat
ure from the race for the coveted prize.

SULLIVAN SAYS
HE IS UNPLEDGED
New Chief Has Not Fixed
on a Captain of
Detectives.
Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr. was at tho
Mayor's office when his nomination as
Chief was made. As soon as he had been
elected he was overrun with callers and
congratulations. In answer to questions
as to his plans, he said:
"I enter upon my duties as Chief of Po
lice absolutely unpledged to any person.
I have not as yet decided whom I shall
appoint Captain of Detectives. So far .13
I am concerned there is no foundation for
the rumor that Lieutenant Esola will be
appointed to that important position. I
have not outlined a course which I will
pursue. I will be guided largely by tho
conditions as I find them from personal
observation. Before anything of import
ance is done I shall have a thorough un
derstanding with the Commissioners. In
other words I feel that the commission
is responsible to the Mayor and the citi
zens of this city for the proper adminis
tration of the affairs of the department
and that I am only the executive odcer
of that commission- And before any
steps of a radical nature are taken they
will be fully and freely discussed between
myself and the Commissioners and, hav
ing arrived at a conclusion, work decided
upon will bÂ« prosecuted vigorously and
effectively.
"I have had slxteÂ«Â«n years' experienca
In the National Guard and thÂ« military
knowledge thus obtained will stand me la

to that degree of efficiency that I think
the Commissioners desire and that I know

COLOKEL WILLIAM P. SDLLIYAN JR., HEW CHIEF CF POLICE.
COLONEL W. P. SULLIVAN JR.. the new Chief of Police, Is a San Fran
ciscan and has lived In this city all his life. In his early career he was
employed as a bookkeeper In several commercial houses In this city, and
his first entry into public life was several years J ago, when his comrade*
elected him an officer in the National Guard. He was promoted several times,
and was ultimately elected to be colonel of the First Regiment, N. G. C. In this
position he was very popular and waÂ« Judged to be a good disciplinarian and a
capable officer.
Colonel Sullivan was the organizer of the League of the Cross Cadets, and it
â¢was due largely to his energy and perseverance that the leag-ue was brought to
Its high state of perfection. He is at present its commanding officer.
When Mr. Phelan was first elected to office he chose Colonel Sullivan for his
secretary, and he has held that position ever since.
MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN
removed William J. Biggy
yesterday afternoon as Com
missioner of Police and ap
pointed D. I. Mahoney to
fill the vacancy. The resignation of Wil
liam Thomas as Commissioner was ac
cepted and William T. Wallace was ap
pointed In his stead. The reorganized Po
lice Commission met last night and elect
ed Colonel William -P. Sullivan Jr. Chief
of Police. These decisions of removal,
resignation, reorganization and appoint
ment mean much to the people of San
Francisco. These incidents tell the story
of a political crime and of a victory won
for decency against the terrific odds of a
corrupt and criminal officialism.
Mayor Phelan Justified, In the
part ho played. the worst fears
of the people of this city. The
Call. In obeying Its obligations to a
decent community, baa exposed Mayor
Phelan as a rascal, a characterization
which Is a libel upon a respectable private
citizen or upon an honorable public offi
cer. The Call Is now compelled In duty
to stamp Mayor Phelan as a revengeful
rascal. He has been caught in a brazen
attempt to steal away from the people of
San Francisco the protection which the
laws guarantee to them. He has acted as
the middleman between gamblers, thieves,
malefactors and social outcasts and the
blackmailers who would feed upon the
excrement of municipal life.
' He has placed himself upon a plane of
fellowship with the criminal and preying
classes of the city. He has been guilty
of an offense which the laws make a fel
ony. In binding himself by ante-election
pledges and seeking to force honorable
men to 6hare the shame of his prostitu
tion. He has tried to deliver into unclean
hands an instrument which can be made
an engine of the greatest crime. To pan
der to his lust of ambition he has sought
to place the young men of the city at the
mercy of scheming blacklegs and the
young women within the claws of social
vultures. He has winked at the evils of
cosmopolitan life and then with a sneer
he has taken refuge behind the screen of
that authority which the people of this
city. Ignorant of his criminal selfishness,
have placed in his hands.
But if he has lost the power to blurh In
the shame of public scorn he feels still the
Btlr.g of rage that prompts to re\'en?re.
Baffled In his unworthy desire to barter
the Police Department away In exchange
for newspaper patronage, he has abused
his power to punish, the man who pie
vented the consummation of bis crime.
He has removed from office tno man v.ho
stood between him and his designs to de
bauch the Department of Police. He h-is
thrust himself again Into the pillory of
public disgust by admitting his guilt, de
fying public opinion, sneering at oubllc
morals and removing from office the man
who said that even the Mayor of this
city cannot throw open the town to crim
inals, make prey of decent men and hon
est women and bring the city to humilia
tion and dishonor.
This man who rises Immeasurably In
public estimation by his retirement under
the command of the Mayor is William J.
Biggy. It was he who prevented the per
petration of the Mayor's outrage. It was
Biggy who stopped the election of a mar.
notoriously incompetent for the position
of Chief of Police. It was Biggy who de
clared that Mayor Phelan could not make
the people of San Francisco pay the
awful price he demanded for his own
prostitution. And it was Biggy, laundry
man as he Is, who refused to wash the
Mayor's dirty linen.
Mayor Phelan had been disobeyed and
he exacted tho penalty, even though that
exaction leaves him stranded on the beach
of public contempt. He had no motive
but revenge for his action. He had no
purpose to gain but to satisfy the demand
of those who had been cheated of their
prey and Insisted upon revenge. He had
not even the unpafe foundation of an ex
cuse for his outrage and was forced to
manufacture one with deliberate equivo
cation and falsehood. And as he sinks in
the estimation of the people he has de
ceived and betrayed Biggy rises for a
manly struggle in behalf of the public and'
for an act that is pre-eminently the great
est in his public life and which merits the
best of good will and the gratitude of the
people of San Francisco. It is because
of the struggle of Biggy that we are not
cursed with an' Esola and It is as an ex-
Commissioner of Police that Biggy has
won his triumph. He has received tho
splendid tribute of bring an uncomprom
ising opponent to Phelanlsm in San Fran
cisco politics and morals.
In removing Biggy Mayor Phelan per
mitted his rage to overrule his Judgment
He gained nothing and lost much, and
what he Is pleased to call his reasons for
the removal prove the fact. The
Mayor's first reason for removing
Biggy Is because the ex-Police
Commissioner refused to do what
the Mayor commanded him to do.
"The Mayor shall from time to time,"
says Phelan. quoting the charter, "rec
ommend to the proper officers of the dif
ferent departments such measures as he

Plot to Elect Esola Chief of Police.
true, and I ask Mr 7 Nowhall, 'wh"o, "-with
me, was opposed to Esola, to point out a
single mlsstatement of fact in my state
ment.
It is not true that I violated any pledge
of secrecy as to the meeting of January
26, or any pledge given to Mayor Phelan
on that occasion. . He does not state what
the pledge was. How can I â¢ deny such
indefinite charges? All I can say Is that
what he asked me to keep secret I. did
keep secret. If it leaked out that he was
getting tired of Esola and suggested the
feasibility of substituting Colonel W. P.
Sullivan as his candidate it was not I who
gave the Information to the papers. It
was town talk a half hour after the com
mission adjourned and it was not I who
made it public. The Mayor has never
called me to task for this and has never
in any way made these charges against
me, either alone or before others, in any
way, so that I might defend myself.
The Mayor says that while acting as
Chief of Police, without authority and
without instructions from the commis
sion I began a series of unauthorized
acts on my own Initiative and that this
conduct on my part culminated in a de
cision of the other three members of the
commission to rescind the resolution ap
pointing me as acting Chief. This Is sim
ply a deliberate falsehood. No such de
cision has ever been made. I appeal to
the records of the board. It is true that
Mayor Phelan asked Mr. Thomas to In
troduce such a resolution and it is true
that Esola's two friends, Messrs. Thomas
and McNutt, were willing to vote for It.
but as Mr. Newhall refused to do oo It
failed of the necessary three votes.-
There never was, either by then board
or by any" member, ' in session or else
where, the slightest criticism' on any *of
my acts as Chief. , What I did was;what
the Chief is authorized to" do. .Acting- as
Chief I perrormed the duties of Chief to tho
best of my ability. It is true that I closed
up the notorious Hotel Nymphla.and the
gambling dens of Chinatown. Does Mayor
Phelan complain of that work? The com
mission never did.
The Mayor says that the day before the
Police Commission was appointed I made
personal application and appealed to him
for the place, to 'which he yielded. Ap
parently the Mayor regards this as a
cause for. my removal. Like the main
parts of the rest of ; his statement it is
absolutely false.
I 'did n<st ask Mayor Phelan for the posi
tion and he did, not give It to me In real
ity. It was given to me. by Andrew M.
Lawrence, managing editor of the Exam
iner. The, truth is, and the public ought
to know It, that ft was Lawrence and not
Phelan who selected ail four of the Com
missioners. Mr. Phelan totally abdicated
his functions In that respect in favor of
Mr. Lawrence. The facts of my appoint
rrient'are as follows:
Friday night, January 5, 1900,, Mr. Irvine,
a' reporter of the Examiner, met tno as I
was leaving the' Columbia Theater and
,told me that he s had been hunting all
'Â¦Â¦ over for me, that Mr. Lawrence wanted
to see me. at , the Examiner office. I
called on him forthwith and found him
in his office in the Examiner building. He
said he had ; been. In â¢ company with the
Mayor during the evening consulting
about the Police Commission; that the
Mayor had given him the four positions
to fill -with his own _ friends; that his
principal object was to haye 1 Frederick
L. Esola chosen Chief of Police; that
Mayor, Phelan knew this and was agree
able to the selection; and. he asked me
then and there to take one of thecom
mlsslonershlps.
I refused at first, saying that I pre
ferred a place on the BosJrd Â¦, of ' Public
Works, "as; l thought I was better fitted
for that position and the work was more
congenial. He then suggested that a va
cancy was likely to occur soon on the
Board ; of ? Public Works and that then I
could be switched ; over from the Police
Commission. 'I "partly ' consented and at
his request called next day. Then he in
formed me that ' my ' colleagues would.be
Newhall.' Thomas . and McNutt. Â¦ He told
me he had selected them himself. I then
told him I would accept. He then spoke
of. Esola for Chief of Police and praised
Â¦ his Qualifications.

HON. Ul/ILLIAM J. BIGGY,
But it is worth while to call particular attention to one man whose election would
materially aid good government, even if he did not have a single honest associate on the
board. We refer to ex-Senator Biggy. He is the sort of man who could make himself felt

has the richt to counsel with them, or. if
necersary to remove any of thorn. "When

ficer from office he shall immediately no

moval and furnish it a statement of the
cause therefor, which statement shall be

(Section 20, article XVI.)
ThereforÂ»Â« I deem It my duty to Interfere
under the Dowers granted me by the char
ter to restore the efficiency of the Police
Department, which has been seriously af
fected by the Internal dissensions in the
Board of Police Commissioners. I find on
Investigation that Mr. Blggry has contrary
to the charter rendered It impossible for
the board- to hold executive sessions, au
thorised by section 4, chapter 4, article' vm
of that instrument, by revealing the proceed-
Mnrs of such sessions. In the matter of
police administration it in obvious that
when the commission so decides secrecy as
to Its proceedings should be preserved by
its own members. The charter, therefore
expressly authorizes executive sessions -to
be held by the Board of Police Commission
ers, a privilege for which there is no ex
press authority as to any other board. The
three Commissioners other than Mr Bleey
have complained to me of thla violation
" of the charter and have stated that It was
their Intention not to B lt with Mr Blrey
and that they had Informed him that
thereafter when executive sessions were
held they, the said three members, would
sit by themselves. The board, however has
no power to discipline one of Its awn mem
bers, except perhaps In this way which
under the circumstances. Is almost justl
flAble. But the charter says that the board
shall consist of four members and therefore
I cannot countenance Its reduction to three
members, which would result in the action
contemplated. It consequently devolves
upon me to correct such abuses. Further

forthwith violated his word, how
ever, and gave full publicity to
that meeting.
On the organization of the
board, at his own suggestion, he
was appointed as Acting: Chief of

.however, as Acting Chief of Police)
and the only object in making the
appointment was to have somebody
represent the Commissioners when
they, were not in session. Mr.
Biggy, ;â¢ without authority and
without . instructions from the
Commission, began a series of un
authorized acts on his own initia
tive. This conduct on the part of
Mr. Biggy culminated in a deci

Police Commissioners had agreed upon a
enjnpromise verdict in reference to Esc!a,
In which that worthy was round guiltless
of the ppeeiflc charges made against him
on the absolute condition that he be with
drawn as a candidate for Chief of Police,.
This condition was accepted by Mayor
Phelan and the next morning the Exam
iner deliberately miPeor.Ftruod the verdict,
proclaimed the vindication of Esola and
with petitions frsm<-J in the Examiner
office and circulated by Examiner em
ployes threw the ambitious lieutenant
apain into the fight. Biggy felt that Ma
own honor was at stake.
He demands thÂ«* rierht to state his case
and defend himself.. It was refused, and,
finding hlmsr-lf hoodwinked by tho schom
lr.s Mayor, he defended himself. When
the Mayer *ays that the other Commis
elonerÃ. complained to him of this conduct
he tells what he knows to be .false. The
Commissioners did not complain to him.
They found no fault with Biggy. and It is
they, not Mayor Phelan. who. tinder tho
Jaw. shall Judge any alleged \-lolation of
their own rules.
It might have been better, perhaps, if
his Honor had ended his reasons here,
for now he begins to deal with facts which
are thoroughly familiar to the public. He
declares that Biggy asked to be made
acting Chief of Police and at his own sug
sestlon was made such. The record shows
th*t the Mayor Is suffering from a pain
ful obliquity of mental vision. Biggy was
appointed acting Chief of Police at the
sueppstion and upon the motion of Com
missioner William Thomas, who remem
bered probably that the Mayor had asked
BipiEry as a special favor to act as his
personal reprefentative on the commis
sion.
Biirgry then, the Mayor continues, began
a series of acts without authority and
without instructions, which conduct cul
minated in the decision of the other three
members to rescind the resolution by
which Biggy had been chosen acting
Chief of Police. It is difficult to discuss
this assertion of Mayor Phrlan temper
ately. It cannot be possible that he in
tends deliberately to tell a falsehood in
reference to an incident which happened
fo recently and which Is still fresh In
thÂ© public mind. Mayor Phelan must
know as well as the public knows that
Commissioner Newhall would not even
jrive the resolution to rescind the dignity
of a hearinc.
He angrily refused to have anything to
do with it and Piggy remained In his po
sition as Chief of Police. Can It be possi
ble that Mayor Phelan does not know that
Biggy was acting Chief of Police yester
day afternoon and that he could not have
been if his associates had removed him?
But Mayor Phelan will not end even
CHICAGO, Feb. 13.â The platform as agreed upon by the committee on
resolutions of the Anti-Trust Conference and as it will be submitted to the
conference for adoption to-morrow morning is preceded by a long address to
the voters of the country. This address urges the people to organize at
.once to deprive trusts of their power. It recites the methods pursued by the
trusts, and the effects of their operations upon the people at large, and cites
as particularly aggressive the Standard Oil trust, the beef trust, the ele
vator .trust, the anthracite coal trust,' the sugar trust, the steel trust and
the paper " trust. ' These great combinations of capital, the address declares,
bear .down all competition' and thus maintain their powers over the people
through discrimination In railway rates and terminal facilities. \
CHICAGO. 13.â After a Seated de
bate the --resolutions committee of :"the
Anti-Trust Conference decided to report
in favor of Government ownership of rail
roads and for their, seizure on payment of
actual value and -without payment for
"watered stock or other fictitious values."
There was a sharp discussion in the com
mittee and several tilts between members
brought on by an effort to make the plat
form read as It had been drawn up. that
the Government should seize the raijroads
on payment of actual values,; "and with
out payment for franchise values."
Unanimous action was finally obtained by
cutting. out the words '"franchise values"
and Inserting Instead the phrase "wa
tered Btock and other fictitious values."
The committee also unanimously fa
vored .direct popular legislation as a
means of obtaining the result.-. . %
The discussion In the committee-room
far. outranked the deliberations of the
main â¢ body of the conference. Ipnatlu*
Donnelly. John P. Altgeld.' A. P. Mc-
Qulrk of lowa and' George Fred Williams
urged the. committee, to strike from tho
resolutions-proposed a statement that any
payment rfor railroads : should be exclu
slva^of .franchise I value. : ; , :
! ?Mahy j startling; statements . were
made before the committee, among
them, one by President M.. L. Lock
wood, in which' he said that before
the Government ownership was final
ly; secured it would be necessary to
impeach at least one Justice of the
Federal Supreme Court. - '".
. The committee also considered a propo
sition to. recommend to the. attention of
Congress Senator Pettigrew's bill for
Government ownership of railroads, but
it was voted down. Â¦Â¦
A number of set speeches were heard in
the morning and afternoon sessions of
the conference. Among tho speakers
were General J. B. Weaver, W. C. Wett
more, Mrs. Helen M. Cougar, ex-Con
gressman Jerry Simpson. I. W. Sample.
John P. Altgeld, E. S. Monnett, Samuel

President Lockwood regretted that W.

Mayor's position in the light of th* In
terview with Commissioner Xewhall on
this subject, which is presented else
where.
And in closing Mayor Phelan reaches
the climax of mendacity by declaring
that Biggy begged for the position from
which he has been removed. Mayor, Phe
lan need not think that brazenness is
protection, xhat . Impudence and sharae
lessnesa are-a'cloak .for unworthy con
duct. He knows that Biggy was an in
cident In .a. co/isplraqy that .was hatched
before election;- that he was. a political
lasl chance,; aÂ£ter the city-had l been can
vassed from end to end, with. which to
consummate, a criminal plot: he was
expected to submit -to the -deal that was
to make Esola Chief of Police, ; and that
he was elected because the Mayor had no
choice. That BLggy.was not dishonorable
Is the reason, and the only reason, of his
removal now. -The Mayor wanted re
venge and has obtained It. v; :i
But what has It cost him In. the good
opinion of those who helped to place him i
where he is? What do independent Re- 1
publicans think now of their choice and of
the wisdom of placing great power In un
clean hands? . The warning was sounded
In time and was unheeded. The people
that have most to lose have made Phe
lans possible In San Francisco.
When the gigantic plot of the Mayor
had failed he attempted, as already de
scribed, to creep out of the mire as easily
as possible. He proposed, the name of
Colonel. William P. Sullivan Jr. as Chief
of Police, and last night Colonel Sullivan
was elected. He is a man of honor and of
ability. His past is a promise that he will
be faithful and honest in the performance
of his duty and while he has had no po
lice experience, he possesses executive
ability and justifies a hope that his ad
ministration will be one worthy of the
city and heedful of its welfare. ..

intention of ousting Police Commissioner

time he caused to ~ be .'filed, after office
hours, with the clerk .of the Board of
Supervisors his official notice that he had
removed Bigpy from office and appointed
David I. Mahoney to be his successor.
Jn the same document he gave notice that
he had accepted the resignation of Police
Commissioner Thomas, naming < ex-Judge
William T. Wallace In his stead. The
document reads as follows:

At the conclusion of the reading the
communication was, on the motion of
Commissioner Mahoney, received and
placed on file. Esola arose to go wh*>n
Mr.- Newhall addressed him. '
"Just before you came In," said the
chairman, "we were about to proceed with
the election of a Chief of Police I do
riot think the board will overlook what
you have done in this matter, because it
makes the way smoother and better for
us, and we are very much obliged to you "

ceeded to the election of Chief of Police

of Colonel Sullivan, whom he compliment
ed highly, saying he did not think a more
suitable man could be named for the of
fice. 7 On rollcall the vote In favor of Col
onel Sullivan was unanimous and he was
declared Chief of Police.
This vexed question having been dis
posed of, the board proceeded to the reg
ular order of business. Patrolman James
Connelly was found guilty of drunkenness
while on duty and was fined 150, with an
admonition that it would go hard with
him If it occurred age 'n.
Charges against Stenographer Otto Hey
nemann were called for hearing. After
two witnesses had been called for the
prosecution the charges were dismissed
without testimony from the defense.
The charges of battery preferred by M.
Cuneo, a , Chinatown coal dealer, Â¦ against
Officer. R. H. Beamer were dismissed. ~
Commissioner Newhall announced that
the Hotel Nymphla: would probably be re-
of the commission, Mr. Newhall,
in his stead.
In appointing the Police Com
mission I had it at first composed
of Messrs. Thomas, McNutt, New
hall and David I. Mahoney, subse
quently named as a member of the
Board of Fire Commissioners. .The
day before the appointments were
announced Mr. Biggy made per
sonal application and appeal to me
for this place, to which I yielded.
I realise now that I committed an
error of judgment, and to correct
my own mistake, which to my
mind has been clearly demon
strated, I . have appointed David

JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor. -
A quarter of an hour after the filing
of the notice Biggy, still in office as
Acting Chief of Police, received the fol
lowing note by messenger:
Hon. William J. Biso*. Police Commis
sionerâ Dear Sir: By virtue of the authority
conferred upon me by sections 13 and 20.

county, I hereby remove you from the office

cified In a communication of thia date to the
Board of Supervisors. Respectfully.
JAMES D. PHELAN. Mayor.
Despite the surreptitious filing of the
notice of Biggy's removal the news spread
over the city like wildfire and was the
one topic of general interest on the streets
before 6 o'clock, at which time large
crowds were reading It on the newspaper
bulletin boards. Concerning the causes
for removal 'everybody was as much in
the dark as Mr." Biggy, to whom the
Mayor had not been courteous enough to
inclose a copy of the document contain
ing them. Mr. Biggy, however, decided
promptly on his course of action. He
concluded that he would- call on the
board, notify it of the note he had re
ceived and make the statement that he
felt that he could not do otherwise than

LONDON, Feb. 13.â The friends of Cecil
Rhodes are becoming alarmed at his pos

see Dr. Leyds," the diplomatic agent ot the
Boers in , Europe, in regard to the prob
able course the Boers would pursue in the
event of his capture. Dr. Leyds assured
the intermediaries that the Boers did not
intend to kill Mr. Rhodes, but, he added,
they would certainly hold him as a host
age until the indemnity for the Jameson
raid was paid. In view of the'develop
ments since the raid the Boers have also
decided to double the amount of the in
demnity demanded, ,so Mr. Rhodes'
friends will have to hand over Â£2,000.000
($10,000,000) before he is released.

Advanced Liberal for Wyck district, gave
notice of a resolution calling attention to
the fact that the colonies are without rep
resentatives in the Imptrfal Parliament.
The resolution was set down for a month
hence, but it is not likely that time "will
be found then for discussion. Â«.
Under Secretary of State for the For
eign Office, the Hon. St. John Broderick.
was asked whether th? Government had
received any communication from Ger
many modifying the declaration made In
ISSj by the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Baron Marshal yon Beiberstein. to the
effect that German's only policy was the
maintenance of the Transvaal as an in
dependent state., in accordance with the
treaty of ISS4. He replied that no commu
nication had been received from. the Ger
man Government relating to the con
vention of ISS4, which he added, as a mat
ter of fact, was terminated by the state
of war.
The Under Secretary of State for the
War Office, Mr. Wyndham. definitely set

mander in chief. Replying to a question.
Mr. "VVyndham said the commanders in
the field were selected by Lord Wolseley
subject to the aproval of the Secretary
of State for War, and added that every
selection put forward had been approved.
When debate on the army supple
mentary estimates was resumed Mr.
Wyndham, during the course of a speech,
again Intimated that an attempt would be
made to democratlcize the army, which,
he said, he thought ought not to be closed
to officers who did not enjoy an income of
from Â£150 to Â£000 a year. Mr. Wyndham
also said it was a scandal and danger to
the empire that young men could not en

able to give them Â£500 a year. The Under
Secretary further announced that it was
not Intended to raise volunteers in Ire

PARIS, Feb. 13.^The Temps* corre
spondent in Durban sends an account of
the execution of an English lighthouse
keeper, who was a spy in the service of
the Boers. One day while a troopship wac
passing the high promontory on which the
lighthouse is situated an officer's atten
tion was attracted by singular hellograpn
signals that were being made on the
other side of the lighthouse. The keeper
was watched and it was found that by
the use of the ordinary heliograph code
the keeper signaled each new arrival -of
troops, each movement in port and the
number of men, cannons and horses dis
embarked to accomplices situated on a
mountain some distance away. These
messages were repeated from post to post
and reached the Boer headquarters on tlic
Tugela river in two or three days, and
this has been going on for some time since
the outbreak- of the war.
He was paid Â£60 for each. telegram, and
before beginning his operations : had re
ceived Â£9CO on account, which was proved
by an examination of his account at the
Transvaal. National. Bank, which has a
branch at Durban, and which paid bim
the money. He was a full-bred English
man, 60 years old, 'and had been employed
in the lighthouse for a long time. His
wife and five children would not believe
in his guilt and a painful scene took plate
when he was transferred on board a Â»nan
cf-war, where he was shot.

During Hard Fighting Near Colesberg Strenu

Â»
LONDON, Feb. 14.â A dispatch
to the Daily Mail from
Rensburg, dated yesterday,
cays:
"There has been hard fighting for
6cnie days near Colesbsrg, the Boers
making strenuous efforts to outflank
the British left. The enemy occupies
strong positions from Achtertang
through Potfontein to a point five
miles south of Jagersfontsin.
"The fighting at the outpost camp
baa been very severe during the last
few days. Yesterday the Boers at
tacked the position of the Wcrcesters.
to the southeast of Colesberg. Fight
ing continued all day and after dark
it was considered necessary to with
draw to Bensburg. Our losses are not
yet known.
"On the left the West Australians,
Wiltshires and Berkshires had hot
fighting, but held their positions
against long odds. The Boer losses
were considerable.
"Owing to the growing difficulties
experienced by convoys in raaching
the camps, all the latter were vacated
last night and the troops withdrew
to Bensburg.
"The Boers are burning the farms
of the loyalists, but the latter have
contrived to get away -with their
stock."
T ONDON. Feb. 14. 4:20 a. mâ The
I news of the day is the enforced re-
I tlrement of the British from the
J .Colesberg district under heavy 3cer
"^""^ pressure and probably after bri.-sk
fighting. Thus, at a time ' when I*ord
Roberts Is apparently able to push an
army Into the Free State the Boers make
a counter-stroke In unknown but seem
ingly gTeat force, not far from the vital
line of railway connecting De Aar and
Orange River.
Military observers do not regard this
cc more than a menace. Nevertheless
the news produces an unpleasant Im
pression here. General French had
maneuvered the Boers out of Rensburj?
In December. On January 1 It was re
ported that he could take Colesberg in
two days with reinforcements. These
were tent, but the Boers were also re
inforced. Since then the British linos
have been extended east and west so that
at the opening of this week they consti
tute a great horseshoe twenty-five miles in
length. The lints were not continuous.
but all the strong positior.*Â»were held.
General French, when he joined General
Roberts, took most of his cavalry. Gen
eral Clements was left with the Infantry
to hold the Boers lji.check, but Command
ant Delarcy. with a double turning move
ment, has compelled the British to con
centrate at Rensburg. besides threatening
Roberts' communication.
The Boer mastery of the district has
caus*Â»d a spread of the Insurrection, but
this no doubt will be promptly suppressed.
as large British forces are available not
far away.
The indications as to General Buller"s
Immediate Intentions are contradictory.
One informant, who has intimate relations
with the "War Office, predicts a movement
within the next day or two. A number
of correspondents who have been with
General Buller have gone to Durban for a
few days' rest, under the impression that
nothing is to be done Immediately.
The War Office has directed the Eighth
Division of 10,000 men to prepare to go out.
BRITISH TROOPS DRIVEN
IN FROM THE OUTPOSTS
RENSBURG. Feb. 12 (evening).â The
Boers have again driven In the British
outposts on the western flank to-day, all
outposts at Bastards Nek, HobklrkJ?
Windmill . and other points retiring to
Maeders Farm. There were several cas
ualties, but details have not yet been re
ceived.
RENSBURG, Feb. IS.â Yesterday's re
tireirent of the western outpost* included
the withdrawal from Cole? kooa and all
the surrounding posts. The Boers placed
a <0-pounder at Bastards Nek, command
ing the surrounding country, and suc
cessfully shelled â¢ the British positions.
The Boers numbered some thousand and
T.fre five to one wherever fighting oc

The British are chafing under the ne
cessity of a retreat from their posts',
some of which they had held since tlje

The Boers are actively pressing around

GEN BACKS NOT
TO BE RETIRED
Currency Bill Explained
by Allison.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â When the
financial bill was laid before the Senate
to-day Allison of lowa, the ranking Re
publican member of the Finance Com
mittee, addressed the Senate. Allison re
ferred to the Senate substitute for the
House bill and paid there was no propo
sition to change the existing cumuicy,
gold and silver certificates, greenbacks,
treasury notes and national bank notes.
Allison asserted that he never supposed
there was any doubt in the minds of any
body that this country was on a gold
standard. Said he:
The present bill makes the greenbacks .>beo
lutely redeemable in gold coin. In w. sense
does the bill provide for the elimination of
irreenbackn from our currency. I want to re-
Iterate that there is not a provlÃJon in the first
â¢section of the Senate substitute that la not now
a part of the law or that has not been the
practice at the Government sineÂ« 1879.
Lindsay of Kentucky inquired whether
in case there should be a deficit the gold
obtained from the sale of bonds under the
bill could be used to pay current expenses
of the Government.
"Under the provisions of the Senate
substitute to which I am directing my re
marks " replied Allison, "these bonds for
obtaining gold can be bold only when the
reserve falls below $50,090,000, and I want
here and now to express my firm convic
tion and belief that it will never be neces
sary under the bill to hell bonds for the
purpose."
"But," insisted Lindsay, "will not the
ultimate result be the letirement of the
greenbacks?"
"Under the bill." replied AJlison, "the
greenbacks cannot be retired. I want to
nay that the retirement oi the green
backs or any other part of our money
.-houlil never be attempted witho.ut the
most careful scrutinyVnd the wisest con
fideration of the legislation providing
'or it."
Ai'Â»i of Nebraska interposed to say his
olv'< '-i!on to the bill was that the whole
power to issue money would ue turned
over to the national banks. â¢
Allison replied that under the bill every
dollar -of our currnecy would remain in
circulation.
At the conclusion of Allison's speech
Jones of Nevada continued the debate in
a speech strongly antagonistic to the pro
visions of the pending bill. Said he:
This measure Is the climax of efforts that
have been made since lftS to abolish the uÂ«Â« of
silver. It Is certain that there will be addi
tional legislation prenented at some subsequent
date to retire the J346.000.000 of greenbacks. The
irold-etandard advocates know . that it would
not do to attempt to carry throiiÃh all of their
plans at once. That would be a chock to the
American people. There will be alho an effort
in the near future to retire the treasury notes.
This will afford the national banks an oppor
tunity to regulate the volume of money, save
; only of frold and silver coin. Thus an aggrega-
I tion of private banking: corporations will exer
cise the sovereign function of Issuing money in
stead of that function being vested in the Gov
emt alone.
Speaking of the provision of the bill
which will enable national banks to Issue
currency up to the par value of bonds
deposited. Jones declared that the result
of the authorization of national banks to
Issue so great an amount of currency a^
they would be able to Issue by the pro
visions of the pending bill would be to
j place in the hands of the. banks the credit
of the entire peopl* and the powr-r abso
lutely to bankrupt thousands c./ people
by calling in loans in the regular conduct
of their banking business.
Jones spoke with bitter sarcasm of the
financal dependence of the United State 3
declaring that a cockfight in India or a
war in Africa with the Boers disturbed
the finances of 60.000,000 of Americans He
maintained that this country phould have
its distinctive money which would not
desert us in time of trial and in conclu
sion he advocated the lssueance of a
paper currency by the Government alone
GODDARD
EASY FOR
SHARKEY
Trainer Saves the Veteran
From a Knock-Out in
the Fourth.
PHILADELPHIA, feb. 13.â Tom Shar
key and Joe Goddard, the "barrier cham
pion," met to-night at Industrial Hall in
what was to have been a BK-jound bout.
Goddard, howe'^r, was outclassed and
was 6aved in the mifidie of the fourth
round from an almost certain knockout
by .his trainer, Jake Dougherty, throwing
up the sponge. Sharkey, in a series of
terrific rushes, had warmed things for
the veteran until defe3t seemed to be due
in the next blow, when Dougherty pur
rendered. Goddard was still anxious to
fight and made a lunge at the sailor. They
mixed things up and. after rapid ex
changes, Goddard slipped to the floor, and,
with Tom on top of h'.m, came near roll
ing through the ropes.
More than 4000 persons witnessed the
fight and Sharkey was given an ovation
as he took his corner. The .veteran pugi
list, John S. Clark, was the referee.
The first round was rather tame. Tom
holding himself back. One of his punches,
a left on Goddard's Jaw, was the only evi
dence of light. The round ended in one
of a series of clinches. T^'v* "1 "
Sharicey opened the second round by
rushing his man. He fought fast and
furiously and landed frequently on God
dard's body and face, and was especially
effective with a number of short-range
blows. GtKidard managed to land several
times on the sailor, but did no damage.
Toward the close of. the round Joe was
apparently evading punishment and con
veniently slipping to the Iloor Just before
the bell. . : J'^'i'il
The rushing tactics were repeated by
the sailor in the next round, and Goddard
tried to save himself by frequent clinches.
A body blow at short range sent Goddard
to grass. He took the full time toeing the
scratch, and. after some fiddlng, he again
went down from an easy blow. Goddard
was weak when the. gong sounded.
One minute and ten^ seconds of the
fourth round hart passed when Goddard s
trainer gave up the fight. Throughout the
bout the youth, strength and agility of
Sharkey told against the years of the
older man, and it seemed a foregone con
clusion that the latter would not last, al
though he finished apparently fresh.
No other soap .in
the world ;is : used- so
much; or so little of

DEMOCRATS MAY
GO TO FRANKFORT
Kentucky Situation Is
Clearing.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. Feb. 13.â The first
sign of a break in the Democratic lines
was noticeable to-day. It came In the
shape of a resolution offered by Senator
TripleU. providing that upon adjourn
ment on Thursday the Legislature name
Frankfort Â«s.its next meeting place.
While no action was taken on the resolu
tion to-day, it is Lolieved to foreshadow
a return of the Democratic legislators to
the State House toon, possibly by the
end of the wÂ«*-k. This action probably
will tx? taken when a report is received
from the committee tent to Frankfort to
investigate as to the presence of mJutla
or armed men around the Capitol and the
advisability of resuming sessions at the
usual meeting place. This is rendered
more likely , as the defection occurred in
the Senate. whÂ»re the Democrats have a
bare workirjr quorum.
With the resumption of legislative busi
ness at Frankfort in prospect and the
transfer to the courts of the claims 01
the rival Governors, as seems likely to be
brought about within a few days, the
clouds are rapidly lifting, and it is be
lieved normal tÂ»olitical conditions may be
restored in the State in two or three

required to secure the adjudication of the

JOE ROSE
WARNED OFF
THE TRACK
Can Book No More at Oak
landâConley and Tim Mur
phy Also Punished.
At a meeting held last evening by the
board' of stewards of the California
Jockey Club Bookmaker- 1 Joe Rose was
warned off the Oakland course. On Feb
ruary 7 in a mile and a sixteenth race de
cided at the track over the bay Red Pi
rate, ridden by Conley, and an 8 to 1 shot,
made a very poor showing, finishing far
outside of the money. Conley was sus
pended, and as Bookmaker Rose had laid
heavily against the horse he was cited to
appear before the stewards. Mr. Rose
failed to put in an appearance, which
caused the stated action to be taken. Con
ley was placed on the indefinitely sus
pended list. , , ,
The stewards meted out a like punish
ment to Tim Murphy, the well-known
bookmaker and turf correspondent. Mur
phy openly charged Jenkins with pulling
the two-year-old. Count Hubert, when,
that youngster finished third in a race, to
Laura Marie and Corn Cakes.
At his next start Count Hubert "won a
block." and Murphy felt the justification
of his statement. The stewards, how
ever, decided that he had failed to sub
stantiate his charge and warned him off
the course.
Among other matters taken up was that
of W. Narvaez, suspended for a sus
picious-loking ride on Choteau. He had
neglected to attend a previous meeting
when requested to do so, arid now stands
Indefinitely suspended. Cash Sloan was
present, but the suspension against him
was not lifted. >

HUNDREDS OF NAMES
ON CLARK'S PAYROLL
Millionaire Had an Army of Assistants While
Making His Fight for the United
States Senate.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13â The Senate
Cornmitre^ on Prfvlles;Â«>Â« and Klections to
day concluded Its hearing of NeUl in the
Clark investigation, and also heard Wil
liam McDermott. another of the close
friends and stanch supporters of Senator
Clark, in his contest for the Senate be
fore the Montana Legislature last winter.
Probably the most interesting testimony
of thÂ«i day was a statement made by Mc-
Prrm<->:t to the effect that Clark had
ma.J* him a present of SSOW after his
election to the Senate to pay McDonald
for his pf>rvic*e in the contest. He also
testified that he had expended about
$22,009 in the legislative and Senatorial
elections.
In his cross-examination Editor XeiU of
Helena, speaking of Attorney General
Nolan's transcript of his testimony be
fore the Lewis ar.d Clark County Grand
Jury, declared that it was colored
throughout. He rave an Instance in
which he was quoted as saying that he
did tiot know that any money was cor
ruptly spent.
â¢'I believe the word 'corruptly.' ne
EaM, "was intentionally left out."
"Has Mr. Clark a mortgage for $3,000
on the Helena Independent?" asked
Faulkner.
"He has a mortgage for $24,600, and 1
pay him his interest regularly." respend-
Charles Ralph Jacobs, a carpenter frorr.
Butte. testified to a conversation whicn
he had with G. C. Cason. a witness Tor
the prosecution. He had, he ?aid. gone to
CaKon's office when the latter a^ked him
If he wactÂ«d to make "some easy money.
"I replied." *aid the witness, "that
there was no one more inclined to maKe
easy monÂ«Â»y than mywlf. He then told
me "that all I had to do was to go to the
Daly people. Jell them a story and get
ray money. He said: 'They gave me
fs<>o for my testimony and you might as
w*il get some of it. He then eaid he
would go to the other side and see what
he -could do." " . ,
The witness also paid that Cason had
referred h'.m to Campbell. He further
sMited that he had come voluntarily to

Lieutenant C. G. Calkins of the United

to-night on the subject. "Cromwell's
Quest for Empire."
The speaker traced the futile attempts
of England and Spain to. colonize In tropic
lands, showing that the defense of remote
islands divided and weakened the naval
forces of those two great nations.
"For th.c burdens imposed upon the tax
payers by excessive armament, he said,

country where men are worth more man
slaves and commonwealths are better
than factories.' When Massachusetts re
mained deaf to Cromwell' 3 summons for
troops to aid in the field of speculative
adventure she counted homes and liberties
of greater worth than his design to strive
for the mastery of tropical islands and
her perpetuity was assured. Because she
has refused to send her children to lands
where they cannot preserve their char
acter or plant her Institutions California
Is now a free commonwealth^ Instead of
a crown colony like Jamaica."

NEVADA. CaL, Feb. 13.â Fire brokÂ© out
at half-past 6 o'clock this evening In the
attic of the Union Hotel, and within an
hour the building was practically ruined.
It was one of the largest hotels tn North
ern Central California, being three stories
high and containing one hundred rooms.
The flames swept through the attic and
quickly burst from the roof and sides in
many places. The volunteer firÂ© depart
ment had ten powerful streams of water
playing fifteen minutes after the first
alarm and stopped the flames from com
ing below the third story, although it
was necessary to flood the whole interior
to accomplish this. Most of the furniture
was saved, and but few guests lost any
thing. The total loss on the property Is
nearly $20,000 and the Insurance about
$10.00). The Citizens' Bank has held a
mortgage on It for many years, and it has
been' conducted under various- manage
ments. Henry Metzenbaugner has been
manager the past six months and had
built up a large and profitable business.

i 3 conceded to be the cleverer boxer, but
his opponent is immensely powerful and
is credited with being -able to withstand
punishment. He is not so fast a boxer,
but his other qualifications should make
up for this and the result should be a
lively bout. > "Jack" Kitchen of Oakland,
an amateur boxer of marked ability, will
referee the three bouts which go to make

PRESTON EXPECTED TO
ARRIVE HERE TO-DAY
AGENT OF NATIONAL CREDIT
ASSOCIATION.
He May Call a Meeting of City Mer
chants During the Present
Week.
W. H. PRESTON.
"W. H. Preston will arrive In this city
to-day, according to a letter received yes
terday, for the purpose of persuading the
merchants of the city to Join the National
Association of Credit Men. The general
aims of the association have been already
mentioned. Mr. Preston has taken pains
to declare that the . association is not a
collection agency, nor is It standing back
of any commercial agency, nor is it pro
posed to establish any reporting agency.
"We are," so Mr. Preston has written,
"in favor of perfecting such service and
we notice improvements since we began
to -work."
That is the key to Mr. Preston's visit to
the cities of the Pacific coast so far as it
can be ascertained prior to his arrival
here. He has also written that the move
ment is in the interest of the fraternal re
lations among the members of the asso
ciation which will lead to united action
against fraudulent debtors. There are
funds among the Eastern associations
that are enrolled in the National Asso
ciation which are held for the purpose of
prosecuting fraudulent debtors. The value
of the fund, so Mr. Preston claims, is
mainly in Its moral effect, for It menaces
fraud and. perhaps, prevents fraud. The
National Association at Its recent meet
ing at Buffalo adopted plans for the rais
ing of a permanent fund for tho prosecu
tion of fraudulent debtors. These facts
are gained from advanced literature sent
forward by the National Association to
pave the way for Mr. Preston. One lead
ing purpose Is announced to be "the pro
tection of the mercantile community
against fraudulently acquired stocks en
tering into competition with goods that
are honestly owned." This indicates a
system by which complete knowledge of
the current Indebtedness of all houses do
ing business with the members of the Na
tional Association Is always to be had.
Very likely a metting of the merchants
â¢will be held the latter part of this week.
NEW LICENSE ORDERS
NOW BEING PREPARED
RESTAURANTS AND JTJNK DEAL
ERS MUST PAY.
Tax Collector Scott and His Deputies
Revising Ordinances to Comply
With Charter Provisions.
.In the revision of the license ordinances
now being accomplished by Tax Collector
Scott and his deputies for presentation to
the License and Orders Committee of the
Board of Supervisors at their meeting t"
day at least two new ordinances will br>
adopted covering business concerns that
have heretofore been exempt from li
censes. The first ordinance is Intended \n
compel all restaurants which serve wine
or liquors with meals to pay a liquor li
cense of $10 a quarter. The rough draft
of the order, which is now in course of
preparation, is as follows:
Every person, who conducts a bona-flde res
taurant, who sells or Â« furnishes malt or fer
mented liquors or wines in bottles in quantities
not less than one pint, said liquors or wines
to be served with a meal and drunk on the
premises, shall be designated as a "restaurant
reta-il liquor dealer" and shall pay a license of
$10 Der cuarter.
The second order which Tax Collector
Scott has under consideration will affect
Junk dealers and dealers In second-hand
goods, who also have hitherto escaped the
payment of licenses, and they will in the
future pay $8, $0 and $4 per quarter, ac
cording to the amount of business -lone.
The order reads as follows:
All persons, firms or corporations emraued in
the business of buying, selling or exchanging
Junk or second-hand goods, such as furniture,
merchandise, medicines, wares. Jewelry, etc.,
shall pay a license, after procuring a permit
from the Chief of PoMre. as follows: For sales
aggregating $10,000 per nuarter and over, $3 per
quarter; over $5000 and lesÂ« than $10,000, $6 per
quarter; less than $5000. $4 per quarter.
The liquor license order will read as fol
lows to conform to the charter require
ments:
Every person who sells spirituous, malt or
fermented liquors or wines Ir. quantities less
than one quart shall be designated as a "re
tall liquor dealer," and shall pay license as
follows: Those making sales to the amount
of $5000 and over, $35 per quarter; less than
JOCCO, $21 per quarter, for which the written con
sent of a majority of the Hoard of Police Com
missioners must be obtained.
CONTROL OF EXPENDITURES.
Health Board Has Exclusive Power
Over Its Departments.
City Attorney Lane yesterday filed an
opinion with the Board of Supervisors
defining its powers under the charter In
the matter of expenditures in the Health
Department. Mr. Lane holds that the
board has exclusive control and disposi
tion of all expenditures necessary in the
institutions under its immediate control
excepting as to supplies furnished und<=-r
contract. The appropriation therefore is
part of the general fund.
Regarding tho appointment of em
ployes, they must be limited to those who.
together with the other creditors of the
department, can be paid out of the appro
priation, except with the possible excep
tion of emergencies. The Board of Health
has power to appoint all necessary <'m
ployes subject to this restriction and the
provisions of civil service. . Â¦
All o<mands or. the treasury originating
in the Health Department, excepting thos^
for salaries, mus-t receive the approval of
the Board of Supervisors, which Is re
quired to approve the demands.

CITY TO HAVE
DARK STREETS
UNTIL JULY
Finance Committee So
Decides.
WILL EFFECT LARGE SAVING
SWEEPING SCHEDULE IS RE
DUCED BY ONE DAY. .
Radical Measures Are Adopted to Be
lieve the Financial Stringency
of the Various Muni
cipal Funds.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday decided to recommend that the
street lamps be unllghted from March 1
to July 1, which will effect a saving of
$80,000, to be applied to making up the de
ficiency with which the city is now con
fronted. The recommendation will also be
made that one day in each week be taken
off the street sweeping schedule, which
will make the sum of $15,000 available.
Chairman Jennings stated that the Board
of Public Works would have a surplus
of $40,000, and the $10,000 for Trocadero
Canyon could also be utilized and the de
ficiency would be In a great measure
wiped out.
Supervisor Tobin suggested that the
Free Library be closed for the next four
months', but it was ascertained that the
money could not b_e used for any other
purpose and the plan was abandoned.
The prospective surplus of $30,000 In the
school fund is in the same category as
the library fund, but a way may be found
to use the money to pay salaries for the
month of June.
The opinion of the City Attor
ney to the effect that the Board of
Supervisors has no control over the
expenditures of the Board of Health was
read, and caused considerable unfavora
ble comment. The committee maintains
that It has the power to determine the
legality of all demands presented. Super
visor Tobin suggested that the appropria
tion of $35,000. which was granted the
Health Department at the last meeting
of the board, be reduced as a further
measure of economy, but no action was
taken.
The committee also decided to In
crease the number of days from one to
two each week when streets shall not be
swept, If the exigencies of the city's finan
cial tangle demand it.
Secretary Painter of the North Cen
tral Improvement Association addressed
the committee and requested that elec
tions be held for the issuance of bonds
to pave all accepted streets. The amount
Involved Is about $500,000. but Mr. Painter
is more particularly Interested In the
downtown district. The request met with
little favor, and Mr. Tobin tersely closed
the discussion by remarking:
"I beHeve that the citizens are so sick
of the bond proposition that any new
measures in that line would meet with
lgnominous defeat."
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1900.
EXTRAVAGANZA
DOES THE TRICK
THE Morosco Company hap drawn a
prize In the lottery of public favor
with "Aladdin Jr.," now In Its second
week. and the Grand Opera-house has
come to its own ag-aln in the matter of
larpe audiences. All this is because comic
orx-ra has been retired for the nonce and
extravaganza Riven the call.
"Aladdin" Is proving a much greater
fuccpss than Its sister burlesque "Sinbad,"
althoujrh in the original Henderson pro
ductions the !a.tter was the better money
gutter of the two. This was largely due
to the fact that Eddie Foy. who was in
'â¢Sinbad" and not in "Aladdin," was then
at the height of his popularity; but the
reversal of form at the Grand may be
properly attributed to the fickleness of the
public, which always has been and ever
will be the decpair nf theatrical managers.
As a matter of fact, there is plenty of
reason for the preference given to "Alad
din." whi^h we find winning out so han
dily when not handicapped by the stellar
effulgence of Mr. Foy. It has rather more
meaning than most of Its kind and a tre
mendous advantage on the picturesque
elde. The costumes have a Chinese oddity
and abundance of color and are admirably
get off by Frank King's gaudy scenery.
Some of the scenes are vivid In color,
particularly one, wherein thirty odd young
â¢women in kimonos, each with a paper lan
tern on her head, go through some of
Mr. Jones' most ingenuously Intricate
evolutions. It is a pity that the effect
should be j-polled by the intrusion of a
pale blue and dark lavender frock contain
ing a little girl by the name of Sorensen.
One might forgive her parents the blue
and lavender frock If they had trained
their young one In some other branch of
the light fantastic art than what has
come to be known as "toe dancing."
These feats of the feet are permissible
In the orthodox ballet, which they be
come, but j!g? and cakewalks on the toes
are as hostile to grace as a pair of cor
sets. There are a number of specialties,
some of which are contributed by mem
ber* of the company. The principals are
not called upon for much hard work, but
most of them succeed in being amusing.
Mr. Wolt makes a decided hit with
"Moses I>evl Cohn." and Mr. Persse. who
essays comedy, succeeds in a modest way
In being' far funnier than Mr. Wooley,
who, I believe, is the accredited come
dian of the company. If I am not mis
taken Wooley was really amusing in one
part, but I have forgotten what It was.
It must have been something serious.

AILISON COMPANY FAILS.
Creditors Have Petitioned to Force

The old-time commission house of D. E.
Allison Company has been forced to the

District Court. This petition will be set
to-day for hearing and it is expected that
some interesting developments will be

I>eath. of Frederick Claus Caused by
an Attack of Pneumonia.
City Chemist Green reported to Coroner
Cole yesterday afternoon that he had
completed his analysis of the contents of
the stomach of Frederick Claus, the
youns machinist who died on the 11th of
this month, and found no traces of poison
In It. It la therefore evident that Claus'
death was brought about by natural
causes.
Dr. Leland, the Morgue surgeon, found
that the deceased had been suffering with
pneumonia, but did not think that the
disease was of sufficient advancement to
have fatal results. There were, however,
no other evidences of the cause of death,
and the report of the chemist must be
taken as settling the point conclusively
that the deceased came to his death from
natural causes.

CORINTHIAN CLUB SHOW.
Yachtsmen Have a Final Rehearsal
of Many Funny Things.
If any one who attends the Corinthian
Yacht Club vaudeville performance at
Native Sons' Hall to-morrow night does
not laugh from the rise of the curtain to
the fall thereof it certainly will not be
from any lack of mirth-provoking fea
tures in the performance, but because
there is not a laugh in him. The final re
hearsal was held last night, and under
the direction of Stage Manager "Jack"
O'Brien everything went merrily. Port
Captain Keefe. who In his enthusiasm for
the success of the affair is reported as
not having eaten a square meal since re
hearsals commenced, was on hand to en
force discipline among the recalcitrant ar
tists. \
The skit entitled "Looney's Parisian
Ballet," by McLaughlin, Catheart and
Ryan, is, in the language of the pi ess
agent, "excruciatingly funny." The
amazon march which goes with It Is pre
sented by eight graceful and handsome
yachtsmen In the persons of Westerfeld,
Straus, Finnic. Erskine. Brickell^Cro-well,
Thompson and Harrison.
All the latest songs of the day will be
sung by such famous amateurs as Hynea,
Sloan, Coffin, Tarbox, Flnnie. Frank ond
a host of others, and the choruses them
selves are well worth hearing.
To relieve the monotony of masculine
efforts there will be two lady participants
in the programme. Miss Etta O'Brien,
the delightful contralto, will sing "Sun
set" and "When You Are Here, Love."'
while Miss Fannie Ryan, the pleasing so
prano, is listed for "II Bacio" and "Love
Has Eyes."
The sale of seats has been enormous
and an Immense audience Is sure to be on
hand.
GENERAL BARNES TO
SPEAK IN CHICAGO
WILL ADDRESS THE UNION
LEAGUE CLUB.
Ex-President Harrison and Chauncey
M. Depew Are Also on the List
of Speakers.
General "W. H. L. Barnes has accepted
an invitation to speak at the dinner of
the Union League' Club of Chicago on
February 22, Washington's birthday. He
will speak to the sentiment, "Greater
America." Ex-President Benjamin Har
rison and Senator Chauncey M. Depew
are on the list of speakers.
The annual dinner of the Union League
Club of Chicago attracts national atten
tion. It is a custom of the league to in
vite as speakers three orators of emi
nent attainment. Half an hour's time
is usually accorded to each speaker.
It is quite well known In the Middle
West that the foremost orator of the Pa
cific Coast has been invited to address the
league. General Barnes will doubtless
have the pleasure of addressing an au
dience of the highest character and a
company of distinguished and critical
men. His ability to charm and enlighten
his hearers Is not doubted, in San Fran
cisco.
NARJOT TELLS WHY
HE KILLED GLEASON
DEFENDED HIMSELF FROM BE
ING BEATEN AND ROBBED.
Preliminary Examination of Ex-
Policeman Dillon for Murder
Concluded and Argument
Reserved.
The preliminary examination of ex-Po
liceman Thomas H. Dillon on the charge
of murdering Charles Joyce, grocer, Sev
enteenth and Castro streets, was conclud
ed before Judge Conlan yesterday after
noon and the case was continued till to
morrow afternoon for argument. The wit
nesses examined for the prosecution were
Herman Pyjorge, bartender for Joyce, but
he did not see the shooting, as he took
refuge in the cellar when he saw there
was to be bloodshed. Mrs. Joyce was
called and she testified that after hear
ing the shots she went Into the bar and
saw Dillon, who was bleeding, and sho
said, "For God's sake, Dillon, don't shoot
me." She found her husband stretched
out behind the counter, and he was able
to whisper to her, "Go for a doctor; I am
dying."
The preliminary examination of Ernest
Narjot on the charge of murdering J.
O'Xeil! Gleason In Stanley's prrotto, Turk
and Mason streets, was continued before
Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon and the
prosecution rested. The witnesses exam
ined were B. \V. Hunter, piano player in
the grotto: Charles McClain. bartender,
and Detective Ed Gibson. Hunter' testi
fied to seeing Narjot and Daly fighting
and Gleason acting as peacemaker. He
saw Narjot put his hand in his hip pocket
and then went to the door. Just then he
heard some one say, "Stand back or I'll
shoot." The testimony of the other two
witnesses was unimportant.
After consultation with his attorneys
Narjot took the stand and practically told
the same story as at the time he was ar
rested. He said he was In the piano room
when Minnie Hamilton came rushing in.
crying "Save me; help me." He jumped
up and met Daly, who struck him on the
face. There was a mix-up ajid Gleason
came and held him till Daly "punched"
him ten or fifteen times on the face and
head. Some one caught hold of the dia
mond ring on his finger and he thought
he was being robbed. He broke away from
Glfason and endeavored to gret upstairs,
when some one shouted. "Let him have
It." Narjot gripped his revolver tight
and it exploded. He did not know that
any one was shot till afterward. He was
under cross-examination by Colonel Eddy
when court adjourned. The case will be
continued to-morrow afternoon.
Manila Cigarettes Seized.
Two thousand and twenty-two cigar
ettes from Manila were seized yesterday
by Customs Inspector Joshua N. T. Goss
while some unknown person was attempt
ing to smuggle them ashore from the
British steamer Benmohr, now a United
States army transport. The cigarette*
were placed in a sack and thrown through
a porthole upon the wharf.
MINING DEAL TROUBLE.
L. K. Hare, a Broker, Arrested on a
Charge of Felony Embezzlement.
Dr. St. D. Gynlais Walters of Hono
lulu, who has been here since last Au
gust and is stopping at the California
Hotel, swore to a complaint in Judge Mo
gan's court yesterday for the arrest of
L. R. Hare, a mining broker In the
Crocker building, on the charge of fel
ony embezzlement.
The complaint alleges that Hare em
bezzled the sum of $3245 on or about Sep
tember 12 last, which was given to Hare
to liquidate a debt due by the doctor to
E. M. Keys and R. H. Blake. The origi
nal amount was $6000, which was invested
in gravel mines in Slskiyou County. Hare
returned J2OC* and was to buy stock for
the balance, but only bought $700 worth,
the balance of $55 being for incidentals.
Hare was arrested and wp-s held pend
ing putting up $4000 bonds. He treats
hi? arrest lightly, and says that the
property Dr. Walters bought was his own
and now the doctor wants to get out of
the deal.

ELEVATOR WELLS UNGUARDED
SHE STEPPED ON A TRAP AND IT
GAVE WAY.
Standard Biscuit Company Is Cen
sured for Violating an Ordinance
of the Board of Super
visors.
The death of Minnie Bemico McClellen.
the 18-year-old girl who was killed last
Wednesday by falling through an un
puarded elevator shaft, was investigated
by Coroner Cole yesterday and the Jury
censured the Standard Biscuit Company
for violating the city order requiring safe
guards to be placed around elevator
shafts.
As a part of the evidence In the case the
Coroner read the following communication
to the jury:
Dr. R. Beverly Cole, Coronerâ Dear Sir:
We, the i2n<Jersig!s<*d, whose vocation com
pels us to approach an* use freight ele
vators and whop* lives and limbs are In
constant danger owinu to the nonapplianre
of suitable (rates or puards affixed to same,
nvet r^sjifctfully r-qiif-st you. In rendering
your verdict in the case of Miss Minnie
McClellen. who r.iÂ«t pjrh a shocking death
Jn the building of the Standard Biscuit
Company, to recomirend the Board of
Public Works or the Supervisors to amend
the ordinance relative to elevator hatches
and thus avoid the reoccurrence of similar
accidents.
ReFpectfully yours. Charles H. Known
burg. Henry Mcl>>nald, John T. Collins,
James Graham, William O. Mara, Charles
PoulÂ»cn and Thomas McDermott.
The evidence was to the effect that the
zrapdoors covering the elevator well were
of such flimsy construction that they
would tilt If the corners were stepped
upon. It was shown that at the time of
the accident the room was dark and that :
the unfortunate jclrl In leaving the build-
Ing at the close of her day's work stepped
upon the trapdoor on the fourth floor. The
door tipped up and her body shot down to
the trap on the third floor, tearing away
that door and the trapdoor of the second ;
floor, through which she dropped with a ;
fractured skull, she having been killed al- j
most Instantly.
The following Is an extract from the
verdict of the Jury:
That the f-ald Remice MeClellÂ»n. a^ed
1* years, nativity California, residence 74
Webster etreet. came to her death at 701
Front street. In the city and county of Pan
Francisco, on the 7th day of February. ISOO,

further find that said Rernlce McClellen
received s&ld fracture of the skull by ac
cidentally falling through the back elevator
shaft from the fourth floor of the Standard i
Biscuit Company at said 701 Front street, '
end that said Standard Biscuit Company
is criminally to blame for the accident
which resulted in the death of said Bernlce
McCleJlen. inasmuch ac the trapF in said
elevator shaft were flimsy and unsafe in
their construction throughout and were en
tirely unprotected by any kind of rail, pate,
door or drop door, which Is In direct viola
tion of section 24. on pape 176, of the fcen
eral orders nt the Board of Supervisors.
And we would hereby call the attention of
the Grand Jury and the fire marshal and
others in authority to the many faulty con
ditior.s surrounding this and many other
elevators in this city and county.

Coroner Cole at once approved the ver
ilet and discharged the Jury after having
thanked them for their sen-ices.

In tha selection of Hon. Thomas R. Bard for United States Senator our Re

The election of Hon. Thomas R. Bard to the United States Senate on "Wednes
day gives the best of satisfaction to Republicans generally and is a. most happy
outcome of a long drawn out and bitter contest over the selection of a successor

California is to bÂ« congratulated on the* action of her Legislature 4n the
election of Thomas R. Bard as United States Senator. This gentleman has a

Burns has been turned down and the State has been saved from the disgrace
of sending to the United States Senate a man with such a black record. It
has costus a pretty penny to elect a Senator, but the cost does not cut euch a

ulate the Republicans who caused the election of Bard, but for thÂ© supporters of
Burns there are no words strong enough In the American language to express our

There is a great rejoicing all through the State over the unsuccessful effort
of I>- M. Burns to capture the Senatorial peach. It is a matter for rejoicing,
too, that the determination to have "any one but: Burns" did not result in the
selection of one equally undesirable, but a man whose character is unassailable
and whose ability to fill the responsible position Is unquestionable. Senator
Thomas Bard will ably represent California's interests in the nation's legisla
tive halls. ...

The, outcome of the Senatorial struggle in Sacramento is a source of great
satisfaction:; to ".the people of California. The election of Hon. Thomas R. Bard
of Ventura reflects credit upon the State and the Republican party. It was a
splendid victory of the people over machine politics and is probably the most
satisfactory outcome of an California's Senatorial contests. Burns is widely
known as apolitical manipulator, while Bard Is a man of the peopleâ a quiet,
successful business man, whose political career is not one of "State making" or
convention uackinff. but of auiet support of the principles he holds dear.

THE COST OF COLONIES.
OFFICIAL reports recently issued by the
French and German governments concerning
colonial affairs can be studied with profit by
thoughtful Americans. We are urged by the imperial
ists to enter upon experiments which the French and
the Germans have tried for a good many year 3 and ;t
will be of advantage to us to learn what results they
have obtained.
The German reports have been issued from the
Statistical Bureau in Berlin and give an account of
the trade which Germany has carried on with her
colonies during the past year. From these it appears
that ditring the year Germany imported from her
colonies goods to the value of 4,617,000 marks and ex
ported to them goods and silver coin to the value of
10,149,000 marks, making a total trade of 14,766,000
marks.. That looks like a very good trade to follow
the flag, but further statistics show that the subsidies
given by the imperial Government to the colonies
amounted to 14,788,000 marks. Thus the cost of send
ing the flag to the far off dominions was 22,000 marks
more than the whole amount of trade that followed it.
In that loss moreover no account is taken of the cost
The results of the French experiments are given in
a report of the Colonial Committee of the Chamber
of Deputies. They show that during the last ten
years the contributions of the French colonies to
the colonial exchequer have amounted to $125,000,
while the expenditure of the Government in admin
istering,the affairs of the colonies during the same
period amounted to $164,400,000. The French statis
tics deal solely with matters of revenue and adminis
tration and throw no light upon the results of trade
with the colonies. It is safe to say, however, the com
mercial benefits have not been less dearly bought than
those obtained by Germany, for the French, like the
Germans, have had to grant enormous subsidies to
keep their colonial trade going.
It will be seen from the experiments made by these
governments that colonies cost more than they are
worth. Trade will follow the flag on a merchant ves
sel far more profitably than it will follow the flag
carried by a warship or a regiment. The Germans
and the French moreover have reduced the cost of
government to about as low figures as is possible to a
civilized people. The wages paid to their soldiers are
small and the salaries of their officials, whether mili
tary or civil, are slight in comparison to ours. It
will cost us to govern a colony far more than it costs
either of those military nations and we are not likely
to get more in the way of trade.
Colonial expansion is in fact about the costliest
venture a nation can engage in. Even Great Britain
has never found it profitable and at the present time
is engaged in wasting more treasure upon South
African expansion than she will get back for the rest
of this Â« generation from all Africa, even if she, suc
ceed in conquering the Transvaal and building the
great railway from the Cape to Cairo. In all these
things there is a lesson for our statesmen and it is to
be hoped they will be wise enough to learn it in time.

THE ROADS AND THE SHIPPERS
REPORTS from Los Angeles announce that the
conference in that city between officials of the
Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe Railroad, on
one side, and representatives of the various fruit ex
changes on the other, has resulted in an adjustment
of the controversy which for some time past has been
going on over transcontinental fruit shipments, and
that the fruit men have gained relief from the evils
of which they complained.
The conference was a secret one, and that fact will
give rise to fears the results are not going to prove
so beneficial as is now expected. It is said, however,
that the concessions granted by the roads include the
abolition of all private car lines at the expiration of
two years, when the leases made with Earl, Armour
and other owners expire, and a modification of the
routing clause. It is added in the report that "the
fruit men are, as a class, placed on an equal footing,
and that the rebate and money concessions system
â¢will pass out of existence."
In that statement there is much of promise, but
since the whole arrangement has been made in secret
who is there that can tell whether or no the railroads
will keep their promise not to grant rebates to fa
vored parties? The fruit men will have to continue
to stand guard vigilantly through the fruit-shipping
season, for otherwise there is a long array of prece
dents to justify the conclusion that the promises of
the roads will not be kept This is not the first tim;
that railroads have given pledges of fair dealing. In
fact, they have made such pledges over and over again
to or.c another, but in almost every case they have
broken them as soon as they found it profitable to
do so.
While there will be general gratification over the
settlement of this particular dispute, even though it
should prove to be only temporary, the public should
not expect too much from it. The only adequate
way of settling these and similar disputes affecting
transcontinental freight rates is to give to the Inter-
State Commerce Commission the additional authority
and power which it has just asked of Congress.
Clothed with that power the commission could com
pel the roads to keep their promises of fair dealing,
and, in fact, could compel them to deal fairly whether
they had promised to do so or noL

THE SOCIAL PROBLEM.
THE case of Amy Murphy has led to a spas
modic and, in many respects, unwholesome dis
. cussion of a social problem, that neither legis
lation nor declamation can settle and solve.
At its base lies the old issue of the necessities of
existence. Poverty, crime and transgression originate
in some breakdown, perhaps in a remote generation,
of the capacity for self-support. Too many parents
pass a life of toil in the effort not to equip their chil
dren for self-support by their own exertions, but to
amass a competency which will assure their support
without personal exertion. In the percentage of
cases in which these parental efforts finally fail, the
children in whose behalf they have been made are
left without provision and without training in indus
try and thrift, to finally become, or contribute, re
cruits to the great army of the incapacitated, from
whose ranks the world gets its degenerates, society its
vampires and prisons their recidivists.
In whatever cause it may generate, aversion to
proper industry and lack of ambition to persist in any
form of honest effort that will bring independence
lead to the same result. No legislation can prevent
it, no generosity of opportunity can banish it. The
remedy lies in the character of the individual, and in
the final analysis society has no other protection than
the development of character. The necessity for self
support is present in a majority of the people. The
world would be better if that necessity were felt by
all.
In American life there has been growing a false
spirit of foolish discrimination between different
forms of personal exertion and modes of employment
by which self-support may be achieved. Without any
desire to discuss a sorrow that has touched a family,
the case that has been recently discussed in the press
and pulpit may serve as an example. The most whole
some tone of American society was in that period
when American-born girls sought independence and
had a valuable training for their future domestic du
ties along the line of occupations that were suited to
their sex. New England never had a nobler popu
lation that when young American women, self
respecting and modest, worked in the mills. The
New England mill girl won her dowry and crowned
herself with honor, and her class mothered a genera
tion of men who reflected its glory and lived in its
praise. In that day, too, no American girl felt that
domestic service and mastery of the art of house
keeping were beneath her. In domestic service she
had the guarantee of a good home, kindly companion
ship, good example in morals, and the relations
of confidence and friendship she acquired were
lasting. In these respects a sinister change
has come. Girls who must contribute to their
own support will take places in shops and
stores, in telephone exchanges and telegraph
offices, and, without the vocabulary and edu
cation necessary for excellence, will contribute to the
army of typewriters and stenographers recruits in
competent and unqualified, earning in these occupa
tions less than is necessary for their support and
dress in the style required by the positions they hold.
Instead of being in an atmosphere of virtue and good
example they are in an environment of suggestion
and exposed to contacts that lead to degradation.
The numbers in which they offer for these employ
ments tend to reduce wages below the standard of
decency and morality, and to injure thereby the in
come of the most competent. They pull down to the
level of their incompetence the guild of capable
women who in some of these occupations earn and
should have compensation equal to that enjoyed by
men. In this system there appears a phase of life
the most melancholy that the mind can contemplate,
If not in the first generation, surely in the second,
it produces a class untrained in self-restraint, reared
in hereditary poverty, degenerate physically and
morally, and ready to exist by yielding to the invi
tation of vice along the line of least resistance.
These victims of folly, who crowd into the hectic and
unnatural conditions offered by what they choose to
consider as "polite employment," condemned to the
nerve-tangling service of the telephone and telegraph
office, or to weary standing for hours behind the
shop counter, or to the rough manners, vulgarity and
profanity of too many offices and counting-rooms,
would shudder with horror at being a "hired girl"
and learning to do housework well, to their own bet
ter equipment as wives and mothers. They turn
away from the good wages, the warm shelter, the
good example which await them in families that need
their service and can compensate it liberally, where
their board and lodging are added to higher wages
than they get in the other occupations, and, scorning
it all, set their feet in the path that ends, for too many
of them, in the morgue.
At this moment there is a home, in domestic ser
vice, for every girl in California who must support
herself. The wages in such service are constantly ad
vancing. The work required is consistent with the
preservation of health and strength, and the associa
tion leads to morality and virtue. Yet the Ameri
can mind has been trained to regard it as the work of
"a servant," and girls reject it, to be servants in
deed of taskmasters who respect neither their woman
hood nor their right to wages that clothe the body
in decency and the soul in purity. The easier, bet
ter paid and more wholesome places in domestic
service are filled with immigrant women from abroad,
or by Chinese and Japanese men, and the press is
filled with the tragedies that close a career in the
polite service, preferred to better wages earned in a
pure atmosphere.
Thoughtful people deprecate the declamatory out
break which has followed the most recent of these
tragedies. One clergyman has advised that men be
shot down whose debased natures prey upon the sit
uation. Women have publicly, pointedly, and per
haps indelicately, discussed the subject, all unaware
that such means have never yet curbed vice, but
rather serve to inform the vicious of the ways and
means for its gratification. No one has proposed any
plan for removal of the situation itself. No one has
attacked the folly and false pride which create it.
No one has uttered a word of advice to girls to cease
crowding occupations where compensation is so low
as to leave no recourse except sin or starvation,
while better, safer and more womanly and dignified
employment waits in vain for their coming.
We deprecate and feel inclined to denounce the
spirit and the method in which the subject has been
publicly discussed:
"Vice is a monster of such hideous mien.
That to be dreaded needs but to be seen.
But seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then pity, then embrace."
The manner in which the sensational treatment of the
subject has proceeded is nothing more than the cul
tivation of that familiarity. Let it be understood that
no law and no public meeting can take the place of
home training in modesty and virtue, and that pride
goes before a fall, and the fall is farthest when pride
has rejected a form of employment- well paid, safe
and honest, in favor of something which is neither,
and the moral lapses will be less and society will be
better.
TO MEET IN CHARLESTON.
AN official bulletin just issued by the executive
committee of the National Educational Asso
ciation announces the unanimous selection- of
Charleston, S. C, as the 'place of meeting for the
convention of the association in July of this year.
The selection of such a place of meeting for a mid
summer assembly of persons from . all parts of the
Union is hardly likely to be regarded wjth favor at
first thought, but the committee accompanies the
announcement with good and sufficient reasons for
the choice.
It appears from the' circular that at the meeting in
Los Angeles the board of directors indicated a prefer
ence for Charleston by a larger and more decisive
vote than has been given for any place of meeting
within the last ten years. Notwithstanding that fact
the executive committee, to whom the decision was
referred, took into consideration the claims of other
cities and visited several of them before deciding.
They found the Charleston people had taken steps to
provide for the convention, and had made arrange
ments "of so satisfactory a nature that no objection
could be found. In fact, the committee say: "There
is no condition which has ever been asked by the
association of the inviting city, that has not been an
ticipated and met in the most generous manner by
the city of Charleston."
As a further reason for selecting that place for the
convention the report says:, "The committee were
deeply impressed by the earnest appeal of the citizens
of Charleston, indorsed with equal earnestness by the
leading educators and the press of the South, that the
present is a most opportune time for the National
Educational Association to lend its aid in. support of
the recent revival of educational interests in the
South, which is no less manifest than is the industrial
revolution throughout the same territory. More
over, the committee could not fail to recognize the
new national spirit which has arisen from co-opera
tion in the recent Spanish-American war, and which
suggests the certain and valuable results that will fol
low a closer and more helpful fellowship in solving
the peaceful and important problems of national life
and education. While it is believed that the associa
tion can do a great national service by meeting in
Charleston, it is also believed that both profit and
pleasure will come in large measure to those teachers
of the North and the West who take this opportunity
to gain a* personal acquaintance with the South and its
peculiar social and educational conditions, and at the
same time enjoy the courtesies of a typical Southern
city, famous for its hospitality as well as for its many
interesting historical associations and surroundings."
The reasons given are sufficient to justify the
choice. It is true Charleston ha 3 not been known as
a summer resort, and that in July the weather will be
trying upon the delegates from the Northern States,
but for all that the city is not without its summer
time attractions. It is, moreover, desirable that the
Educational Association do all in its power to en
courage public education in the Southern States, and
the general gathering of distinguished educators
there will have a marked influence in that direction.
During the last decade South Carolina has not only
entered upon a new era in its history, but has made
a notable advance in the development of a new order
of things. The industrial spirit of the people has
been awakened to such an extent that the census of
this year will rank that State in cotton manufacturing
second only to Massachusetts. New industries re
quire, of course, new education, and with the fac
tories now springing up in all parts of the common:
wealth there will come a demand for better schools
and longer terms of yearly instruction... At the
Charleston convention the members of the associa
tion will have an opportunity to study the educational
conditions of the South to the best advantage, and
good results may be expected both for the educators
and for the hospitable people who entertain them.

RULERS OF THE WORLD.
Meat-Eating Nations Are the Leaders
in Every Branch of Human
Achievement.
The ruling nations of the world are meat
eaters and history records that they al-
ways have been.
Vegetarians and food cranks may ex-
plain this in any way they choose, but thft
facts remain that the Americans. Eng-
lish. French. Russians and Germans ar->
meat eating nations, and they are also the
most energetic and most progressive.
The principal food of the heroic Boer
soldier known aa Biltong, is a sort of <JrleÂ«l
beef, affording a great deal of nourish-
ment in a highly concentrated form.
The weak races of people are the rleÂ»
eatlnsr Chinese. Hindoos and Siamese, re-
garded since the dawn of history as non-
progresslve, superstitious and inferior
physically and mentally to the meat eat-
ing nations who dominate them.
The structure of the teeth plainly indi-
cates that human beings should subsist
upon a variety of food, meat, fruit and
grains, and it is unhygienic to conflno
one's diet to any one of those classes to
the exclusion of another.
Meat is the most concentrated and most
easily digested of foods, but our manner
of living is often so unnatural that tha
digestive organs refuse to properly digest
meat, eggs, and similar nutritious and
wholesome food, but it Is not because
such food is unwholesome, but the real
reason is that the stomach lacks, from
disease or weakness, come necessary di-
gestive element: hence arising 1 indigestion
and later on, chronic dyspepsia.
Nervous people should eat plenty of
meat, convalescents should make meat tha
principal food, hard working people hava
to do so. and brain workers and ofÃca
men should eat, not so much meat but at
least once a day and to Insure Its perfect
digestion one or two of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets should be taken after each
meal, because they supply the peptones,
diastase and fruit acids, lacking In every
case of stomach trouble.
Nervous dyspepsia, catarrh of stomach,
gastritis, sour stomach, g-a3 and acidity
are only different names for Indigestion,
the failure to digest wholesome food, and
the use of Stuart's Tablets cures them
all because by affording perfect digestion,
the stomach has a chance to rest and re-
cover Its natural tone and vigor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the real
household medicine; it is as safe and
pleasant for the stomachache of the baby
as it is for the Imperfect digestion of Us
grand sire.
They are not a cathartic, but a diges-
tive, and no pill habit can ever follow their
use; the only habit Stuart's Tablets in-
duces is the habit of good digestion and
consequently good health.

TO IMPROVE
YUBA RIVER
Extensive Operations to
Be Commenced.
Special Dispatch tÂ» The Call
MARYSVILLE, Feb. 13.â The people of
Tuba and Sutter counties are greatly
pleased with the general outcome of the
extra session, and particularly so with
the passage of the river Improvement bills
f>o energetically pushed by their repre
sentatives. Senator Cutter and Assembly
man Raub. These bills were passed at
the regular session a year ago, but one,
although signed by the Governor, was
invalid because of errors in enrollment,
and the other reached the chief execu
tive too late for action. It was largely
through the efforts of the Senator and
Assemblyman that the bills were included
in the work of the extra session.
The first bill, as shown by its title, re
creates the office of Commissioner of Pub
lic Works, without which the auditing
board to such Commissioner would be a
body without a head. The second bill
amends the auditing board act so that
the operations of the board, heretofore
confined to Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers, may be extended elsewhere, and
particularly to the Feather Kiver, where
there Is pressing need for it.
Now that the bills are laws, the audit
ing board and the Commissioner can pro
ceed to construct such works on Feather
River as will be of the greatest benefit
to the county of Sutter in the way of
preventing overflow. It is understood the
work will be commenced very shortly.
The United States engineers have rec
ommended an appropriation of $SOO,OOO to
be expended in the construction of im
pounding works on the Yuba River and
the cutting of a new outlet which will
relieve the city of Marysville in a great
measure from the danger of o\'erflow. If
approved by the Secretary of War and
by Congress, this amount, together with
the $250,000 already appropriated by the
State, will very likely be spent in such
work this summer, which will make lively
times in this section.
The Legislature, at the extra session,
passed a joint resolution introduced by
Camlnetti, urging the Government appro
priation mentioned, and it will likely be
made.
HO POOLSELLING
IT STATE FAIR
Sacramento's Stringent
Anti-Gambling Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 13.-Mayor Clark
and President Ing of the Board of Trus
tees this afternoon signed the anti-pool
room ordinance and it will go into effect
on March 1. The original proponents of
the measure intended that it should affect
only the pernicious poolroom evil as It
existed downtown, and they had no desire
to prevent the Bale of pools at the Sep
tember race nieeting in connection with
the State fair. Accordingly an ordinance
was framed which excluded the State fair
races from the prohibition. As amended
by Trustee Ing, and as finally passed,
however, the ordinance was made to cover
the State fair poolselllng, as well as the
regular business of the downtown pool
rooms.
The people of Sacramento are now con
fronted by an Interesting state of affairs.
Attorneys of prominence declare that the
ordinance, if enforced, will prevent pool
celling at the State fair races, and it is
quite generally conceded that, no mat
ter how vicious the poolroom as an insti
tution may be, a State Fair will prove ex
tremely tame without the sale of pools In
some form or other. Mayor Clark is
pledged to an enforcement of the ordi
nance, and he has reiterated this pledge
from various pulpits, to which he had
been called by the approving pastors to
address their flocks, and from the stage
of a public meeting of citizens called to
urge the passage ot an anti-poolroom or
dinance.
One director of the State Board of Agri
culture, who desired his name withheld,
said .to-day that If the Agricultural So
ciety could go back to the old plan of
auction pools and paris mutuels it would
be something, but under the present or
dinance this cannot be done. Last year,
said this official, the society got over
JlB.OOO out of the bookmakers, and, profit
ing by the prestige of the last successful
fair, $20,000 or $22,000 could be expected
next September. Under the old parl mu
tuel plan the society never realized in one
year more than $9000 profit. Since it al
ways requires some close figuring to make
the fair a success, said this director. It
will be seen that the falling off in Income
from this source would seriously affect
the finances this year.
Corporation Counsel Johnson, when
spoken to on the subject of the ordinance
and its relation *.o the State Fair, made
the cheerful observation that the fair was
yet a long way off. It Is not improbable,
men about town think, that by next Sep
tember the antl-gambllng crusade will
have parted with something of its present
snnp and vigor, and that the merry shout
of the bookmaker may again be heard at
the State Fair grounds.
successful, would enable Carnegie to con- !
flscate Frick's interest in the firm at prob
ably not much over 33 per cent of its real
value- that is, say, not over $6,000,000 lor
what, on the basis of Carnegie's option.
was worth $16,238,000. This scheme. Frick
says, he can prove waa to reinstate ana
make operative an unexecuted and aban
doned so-called ironclad agreement of 1887.
which related solely to Carnegie Bros. &
Company, limited, and never did include
the Carnegie Steel Company, limited: and
also to attempt to make binding on Frick
another so-called ironclad agreement of
1892. which Carnegie never before had ex
ecuted, which Henry Phipps had always
refused to execute and which many other
partners had never signed. This agree
ment, contemplated in 18D2, Carnegie
knew, as Frick now alleges, was absolute
ly void in IK)9, and yet Carnegie appears
at a meeting of the board of managers of
the Carnegie Steel Company, limited, held
January 8. 1900, in Frick's absence, and
passed false and misleading resolutions
whereby he attempted to make operative
and reinstate the so-called ironclad agree
ment of ISS7 and also directed his co-part
ners to sign the so-called agreement of
1592, which neither he nor many of them
had heretofore executed. All this, it is
alleged, Carnegie did secretly and pur
posely conceal the knowledge thereof
from Frick. ,
Carnegie was enabled to control his
partners because most of them still owed
the firm money for their Interests and
Carnegie, dominating the firm by a ma
jority Interest, they were unwilling or un
able to withstand his demands. Carnegie
induced some of his co-partners to sign
the co-called agreement of 1592 and then
without warning sprung upon Frick a no
tice on January 15, 1900, which he has also
caused his co-partners secretly to sign
and which was based upon the pretended
existence of the so-called Ironclad agree
ments.
Carnegie followed this notice by com
pelling on February 1. 1900, Schwab, the
president of the company, to transfer on
the books of the company all Prick's In
terests In the Carnegie Steel Company,
limited, to the said company, and he now
pretends that he (Carnegie) can practi
cally dictate to Frick the value at which
he will take the Interests. He claims that
Frick is not entitled to anything for the
good will of the company, nor entitled to
have hia interests valued as of a growing
concern, but that he (Carnegie) can use
old and obsolete figures which have stood
on the books for years in many respects
unchanged, so as to reduce the value of
Frick's interests to the neighborhood, he
hopes, of about $6,000,000. As Carnegie
owns one-half of the Carnegie Steel Com
pany, limited, he will, therefore, own
more than one-half of the 6 per cent
which Frick sells, and if he can thus ac
quire 3 per cent of Frick's holdings for
what would amount to about $3,000,000 he
will make a net profit off that transaction
alone, based on his own selling price as
above stated, in the neighborhood of
$5,000,000.
Frick further says that never sinca ISS7
had either firm attempted to force a part
ner to sell. That no interest whatever
was *.ver acquired under the so-called
agreement of ISS7. and none under the one
of 1892, except that at tiine3 when the
financial condition and earning power of
the company were radically different the
company did purchase the interests of
three deceased partners, but by an ami
cable and satisfactory arrangement with
the representative of each. Neither in the
whole history of both firms was it ever
supposed that any partner had placed
himself in such condition that Carnegie
could through personal malice force him
from the firm, and that lor Carnegie to
attempt this in 1900 througn the guise of
proposed agreements which Jookoa to the
honor and well being of the firm, to grat
ify his personal malice, was most viciou3
and fraudulent misconstruction and mis
use of the same.
">'he bill alleges that the new partnership
of the Carnegie Steel Company, limited,
is not a limited but a general partnership,
but Frick is unwilling to take advantf.jre
of what he believed to be n limited part
nership until he was advised otherwise
after this controversy arose, and he there
fore offers:
(a) To sell his Interests In the firm at what
the business men will Judre them fairly to bÂ«
(b) To execute new papers makln* a ralld.
bindlnsr. limited partnership, and to continue
the firm In all respects as it was Intended here
tofore to do.
<c) To continue the firm even If It Is a iren
eral partnership and all arc Individually relia
ble, provided he be allowed to participate in
the management, because to leave the sole
manaee-ment to Carnegie would result eventu
ally as he (Frick) believes In financial loes.
(d) If Carnecie refuses all thsse offers then
he asks the court to dissolve the partnership
and have a receiver appointed to sell the prop
erty and pay the debts and distribute the bal
ance.
Mr. McCook also called attention to the
fact that three of the oldest partners â
Henry M. Phipps Jr., Henry M. Curry and
F. T. F. Lovejoyâ and several smaller
holders of Interests are In sympathy with
Frick and opposed to Carnegie's present
attempt.
The bill was not filed until 5 o'clock
this afternoon and the Carnegie Steel
Company was not notified of the suit,
owing to the lateness of the hour. A copy
of the bill will be sent to the defendants
to-morrow.

NKW YORK. Feb. 13.â Congressman Charles A. Chickering of Copenhagen.
X. T., was found dead outside the Grand Union Hotel in this city to-day.
He had either fallen or jumped from a fourth-story window of the hotel.
The body was found under ihe open window of his room, which was on
the fourth floor, and evidently it had been lying there for some time, as
the clothing was soaked with rain. There was a large gash in the right side of
the head. Mr. Chickering had been in the hotel all day yesterday and had com
plained considerably of rheumatism, but nothing irrational had been noticed In
his actions. A dispatch from Albany says that Mr. Chickering's friends there
have been aware that for some time he was afflicted with melancholia, following
a severe attack of typhoid fever.
Charles A. Chickering was born at Harrisburg, Lewis County, N. V., No
vember 26, 1543. He was educated in the common schools and at the Lowville
Academy. He was a School Commissioner of Lewis County from 1565 to 1875; mem

tiff the difference between what his Interest
was fairly worth on or about February 1, 1900.
and. the amount he shall receive through the
decree of thla court In final liquidation and
settlement of the eald firm.
The bill in equity is quite lengthy and as
summarized by Willis L. Cook, counsel for
Mr. Frick, is as follows:
In 1592 there were two limited partner
ships (1) called Carnegie Bros. Â«& Co.,
limited, with a capital of $5,000,000. whloh
mads steel rails and owned only the Etl
gar Thomson Steel Rail mill In Bract
dock Township, and (2), called Carnegie,
Phlppd & Co., limited, with a capital of
$5,000,000, which made all kinds of ste-31
plates, structural material. Iron forging,
made the material for and built bridges,
made armor plates and made material for
the same. This latter firm owned the
Upper and Lower Mills in Pittsburg. the
extensive Homestead Mills at Homestead,
the Keystone Uridg-o "Works in Pittsburg,
the Armor Plate Mill near Homestead,
the Hartman Steelworks in Beaver Couii
ty and other properties. Carnegie owned
over 50 per cent of each of the old firms
and he, with Frick, Phipps and others
owning Interests in each, formed, in ISO 2,
what constituted a new partnership called
the Carnegie Steel Company, limited. In
this Carnegie retained over 50 per cent
and now has SSV6 per cent, while r*rick
has 6 per cent. Both old firms were
merged into the new, which had a capi
tal of $25,000,000 and operated all the old
works. This new firm was under the im
mediate care and supervision of Frick, aa
chairman, from 1592 to December, 1833. It
greatly enlarged the capacity of its dif
ferent works, enlarged their output and
purchased other plants, ore mines, etc.
Carnegie lived in New York, passed
much of his time abroad, remaining away
at one time for eighteen consecutive
months. He did not pretend to manage
the current business, although he was
consulted as to Important matters. The
business from 1892 to 1900 was enormously
profitable, growing by leaps and Jumps
from year to year, until in 1599 the firm
actually made on low-priced contracts in
net profits, after paying expenses of all
kinds. $21,000,000.
In November, 1899, Carnegie estimated
the net profits for 1900 at $40,000,000, and
Frick then estimated them at $42,000,000.
Carnegie valued the entire property at
over $250,000,000 and avowed his ability in
ordinarily prosperous times to sell the
property on the London market for Â£100,
000,000, or $500,000,000. In May, ISD9. Car
negie actually received in cash and still
holds $1,170,000. given him as a mere bonus
for his ninety days' option to sell his 58V4
per cent interest In this steel company for
$157,950,000. Frick's 6 per cent on that basis
would be worth $16,238,000.
Frick now alleges, right at the head of
this enormously successful business
whereby at least In part he made for Car
negie these enormous profits and values,
that Carnegie suddenly and with malevo
lent intent toward him, on December 4,
1593, arbitrarily demanded of him his res
ignation as chairman, and this without
any reason except to gratify Carnegie's
malice. Frick, in the interest of harmony,
gave his resignation, and subsequently,
on the 11th day of January. 1900, after
Carnegie had thus deprived him of his
ofllce. he demanded of Frick that he
(Frick) should sell to the firm his interest
in it at a figure which would amount to
less than half of what ' this interest is
fairly worth. Frick refused to sell at that
price, but offered to sell and allow three
men to value theinterest sold. Carnegie
refused this and 'left Frick, threatening
him for not yielding to his demand.
Frick now alleges that after his resigna
tion and at the time of this last Interview

NEW TORK, Feb. 13.â The stock market
peve evidence to-<2ay that the selling move
ment to take profits which developed about
the mlfliile of last week .had run Its course.
The professional operators in stocks who hes
itated to resume operations on the eve of a
double holiday v.-ere buyers at the opening to
day. There was no evidence of renewal of
outside demand, but the professional traders
bought with confidence and maintained prices
quite firmly. There were quite notable ad
*anceÂ» in the local traction sto-.k? due to In
dividual causes, the principal one being a
rumor that Metropolitan was about to take
over Third Avenue. There was a heavy de
mand from short* In the group driven to cover,
thus affording material aid to the advance.
Otherwise the strength of the market was
due to the general favorable outlook for busl
r.ess and indurtry. The day's return* of rail
road earn'.ncs were all extraordinarily favor
eb!e, but the trunk line railroad stocks showed
the most conspicuous effects of the Improved
condition of thÂ«* rate Kltuation and the con
tinued large volume of merchandise traffic.
Pennsylvania rose 5"-i. Baltimore and Ohio
preferred rose ever 2 points, being greatly
effected by the Jar.u.iry statement of earnings,
Â¦which showed practically all of the increase
In pros? firaings suved fcr net. with thÂ«Â» re

broke sharply without explanation. Xot much
sccourt was taken of the money nutlock and
cf the opinions of careful observers that a
period of hiphf-r rates I*. Ilkelv in the near
future, owing to the renewed absorption of
funds by the treasury and the cessation of the

BOSTON, Feb. 13.â The wool market main
tains a steady tone, but the general demand
continues quiet. The demand for quarter-blood

have been bought by manufacturers. The

although dealers are looking for the present
values to be sustained. Fleece wools are quoted
nominally the same, with medium grades rant

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Feb. 13. â Some misguided traders
sold wheat early because Liverpool cables were
not encouragalng and statistics were regarded
as bearish. May opened He under Saturday at
68"riÂ®6S*8C, but when the big advances at Paris
and at Antwerp were received May climbed
on an active market to 69c. At this price three
fourths of the pit had wheat for sale, but sup
port was active enough to prevent any great
recession on reports of damage to the Franch
crop, giving an undertone of strength to the
market. May closed He up at 68%Â©65% c.
Corn was strong on cables and small country
offerings. May closed unchanged at 34% c.
The oats market lagged in spite of the
strength in the neighboring pits.
Profit-taking on a moderate scale, short sell
ing and a slack outside demand sent provisions
to the bottom.. May pork closed 20c under Sat
urday at $10 92%, May lard 7%c down at $6 07%
and May ribs 7H<3loc depression at $5 97%.

OAKLAND. Feb. 13.â Tho glamor ?of
the metropolitan lights had more charms
for Kmma Rowles than the quiet farm
life afforded her by her husband, W.vJ.
Rowles, near Livermore. so a year and a
half ago she deserted the old farm and
sought happier surroundings in the East
by rail. To-day her husband filed suit for
divorce on the ground, of desertion. The
couple were married in San Francisco in
1891. N>> children or property are involved.
Niles' New Jail.
NILES, Feb. 13.â 1t has turned out that
the Jail reported to be in course of con
struction here and to bo paid for by gen
eral Bubscriptlon is beingr erected by the
constable, Joseph Roderick, for his own
convenience. The report was that the cit
izens, fearing- the presence of a small
army of workmen to be sent into the
valley during this summer had decided to
erect a Jail that would hold any of the
unruly ones, but it appears that the con
stable decided to build a Jail near his own
house, where he could look out for who
ever happened to be in It without leaving
home. The Spring Valley workmen were
here last summer and they annoyed no
body.

he said:
"The fellow J. G. Holland I recollect as
one who had been employed by the quar
termaster's department at Jacksonville.
FJa,, to trace stolen Government mules.
The bacon to which J. G. Holland refers
and with the sale of which he falsely
connects my name : was disposed of by
others In a perfectly legitimate manner
after its condemnation and about one
month before I was assigned to duty in
tho commissary department. The depart
ment while under my control never sold
to the firm of C. B. Rogers & Co. bacon
or anything- else. The bacon In question
has been duly accounted for by the officer
who was in charge at the time of its con
demnation and pale, and the records In
the proper department at Washington will
speak for themselves."

ADMIRAL WATSON
DISOBEYS ORDERS
May Be Disciplined by
Secretary Long.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 13,â
Rear Admiral John C. Watson, command
er in chief of the Asiatic station, has a.p
parently been disobeying the orders of the
Navy Department, and Secretary Long
has taken measures to learn his reason
for the action â¢ taken. â¢
The trouble has grown out of the action
of Admiral Watson in ordering officers to
vessels In direct opposition to instruc
tions given by the department. For In
stance, the department recently ordered
Captain Charles M. Thomas to command
the cruiser Brooklyn, to relieve Captain
T. F. Jewell. Captain Jewell started for
home a few days ago and Rear Admiral
Watson cabled to Secretary Long that he
had placed Captain James M. , Porsythe,
commanding the Baltimore, in command
of the Brooklyn. Whether this is the spe
ciflc instance to which the department haa
taken exception cannot be learned. It is
understood the department has cabled to
Admiral Watson requesting that an ex
planation be sent to the department.
There is no disposition on the part of
the department to Interfere with the as
signment of officers made by Admiral
Watson on vessels under his command,
but very, frequently specific assignments
are made by the department, ajid it is l>e
lieved they should not be "interfered with.
So far as can be learned Rear Admiral
Watson has not cabled to the department
concerning the Princeton's discovery of
the flag of Japan over the island of
Ibayat. A report was received several
days ago from Admiral Watson announc
ing that the northern islands had been
taken possession of by a naval vessel and
that the natives were found to be peace
able .and tractable and willing to accept
American rule. It Is stated that there is
no dancer of any dispute growing out of
the hoisting of the American flag over
these islands. The Peace Commissioners
at IÂ»aris had a very imperfect map, and
Secretary Hay, who has carefully exam
ined it, has made such corrections as to
show that Ibayat Island is wholly within
American Jurisdiction.
- Secretary Long told The Call corre
spondent to-night that he was perfectly
satisfied with the manner in which Ad
miral "Watson waa administering the af
fairs of the fleet In the Philippines, and
he said he had no Intention of relieving
him. Admiral Watson's health has been
a subject of concern to the authorities,
but the latest Information from Manila
shows that he has entirely recovered from
his illness of last fall.

BISHOP M'CABE.
The Famous Minister's experience
With Coffee.
The well-known bishop said to one of
his friends, some years ago: "I was a
great sufferer from severe headaches,
and at times after traveling many miles
to dedicate a church or perform some
other important duty, found myself
confined to a bed when the time came,
and was unable to carry out my work.
I finally discovered that when I left off
coffee for a few days the headaches dis-
appeared, and by ' further experiment
discovered that the coffee was undoubt-
edly the cause of the difficulty, which
finally entirely disappeared when I left
off coffee altogether.
The person to whom this remark Was
tr.ade is Mrs. Amy K. Glass, wife of a
Methodist minister at Rolfe, la. Shr
srys: "My own experience with coffee
',vi.s very convincing. I was grown up
before I ever drank coffee, but was ad-
vised by a friend (who meant it kindly)
to uÂ«e weak tea and coffee, because a
warm drink aided digestion. I soon
thereafter commenced to have nervous
and fick headaches; could not believe it
was the ccfTee. PViHPfi
"My husband, who had suffered from
dyspepsia while a young man in college,
and found relief by leaving off coffee,
often told me he was satisfied my head-
aches were caused by coffee, so I gave
up the coffee and took up Postum
Cereal Food Coffee. The change taught
me. in a most convincing manner that
toffee was the cause of the headaches,
Imt now I have an equally good coffee
in Postum. and its health-giving prop-
erties are simply undeniable. Our little
children use Postum regularly and go
off to school as healthy and, happy as
children should. If ever husband or
myself take a drink of weak coffee at an
evening gathering or church social we
are kept awake until past the middle of
the night. Yours for health."

FRUIT TREE STOCKS
BRING HIGH PRICES
NTJRSERYXiEEN COINING: MONEY
THIS SEASON.
Very Large Demand Has Been Caused
by. Variety of Concurrent Ctr
â¢"', cumstances. ?â¢ :
According to W. P. Cantelow, who has
extensive knowledge of the work, of the
orchardists of California, there has not
been in five years such a demand for fruit
trees in the State as there Is now. As a
consequence the price of orchard stock
has risen largely and the nurserymen of
the State are coining money. There are
not enough trees to go around of the best
class. However, the nurserymen have
done the best they could to supply the de
mand. There has been a natural disin
clination to introduce nursery stock from,
abroad on account of the danger of bring
ing in Insect pests to the orchards. ' Mr.
Cantelow is stationed at Vacaville, where
he represents Porter Bros., but he also
takes in Winters, Suisun and Napa
County as a part of his territory. His
concern deals with fruit men largely, and
he accordingly has opportunities to leara
about many sections of the State. \
The large demand for fruit trees . this
year comes from all sections. A large
supply has been needed in Santa Clara
County. One reason for the planting in
the counties where the vineyard interests
have been extensive is the destruction of
vines by the phylloxera. The old vines
have been pulled up and fruit trees have
taken their places on a very large acre
age. There has also been a large amount
of replanting In orchards where trees
have died and left gaps. These two
causes alone made large drafts -on the
nurseries, Mr. Cantelow says.
Prime cling Btone and choice varieties
of peach trees are worth from 20 to 25
cents each in the market. Bartlett pear
trees, the best, bring 18 to 20 cents each.
Prune trees are worth IS cents each, and
there is a scarcity at these prices.. Last
year all orchard stock was very low and
there was very little demand for it. But
fruit sold " well last yeajr. Mr. Cantelow
says that the marketing of fruit on the
new basis, of for small profits, in
stead of holding on for a Â¦ large specula
tion, which was the former practice in
California, has had a good effect in mak
ing a speedy and reliable market for the
goods. All orchardists who bad the
marketable fruits last year made money.
Peaches, pears and prunes have establish
ed themselves as the standard fruits. This
beln*? understood, there la a. general turn
ing to the varieties nameu. The general
good times have affected the fruit mar
ket as they have every other outlet for
products offered for salo abroad. When
any line is found to be making money
outsiders rush Into that line. This is go^
ing on now, but the i great planting " this
year is not of new acreage, as has already
been, eald. If this should be a successful
year there will be more acreage another
season In the natural course of events.
HAYWARDS POLITICS
IS BOILING OVER
HAYWARDS, Feb. 13.â Almost every
man in town. ls looking for a local office
this spring, and as there are only a few
places to be filled, many of the 'male con
tingent will be disappointed. Politics per
meates the atmospherellke a fog and wire

most everybody. There are many candi
dates for the office of Clerk, the five prln^
clpal ones being James Collins, the
Incumbent: John Overmuller. E>. J.
Smalley, Clyde Reese and Pete Wilbert.
The leading contestants for Treasurer
are A. L. F. Fisher, who now holds the
Job, and Edward Haas, the leweler. For
Trustees there are a host of seekers. J.

rank in the order and an emblematic
jewel. This circle will give a social in
Its hall on the 6th of March.
Inter Nos Circle at Its meeting last
Tuesday night admitted two members by
card, initiated one stranger and received
several applications, and under good of
the order there, was a pleasant social
hour. This circle has been doing good
work for several months past and the
membership evidently desires to maintain
its well-earned reputation for sociability.
sincerity and constancy. >
At a meeting of Robin Hood Circle last
Wednesday action was taken in the line
of having a social meeting once a month
with a view to increasing the social fea
ture of the circle. The circle has a host
of members who can entertain with song,
music, farce and recitation, and Miss
Alice Ticoulet, who was the mover of the
proposition, desires to bring out this
talent. It is probable that the circle will,
from time to time, invite one or more of
the courts of Foresters to attend these
socials in a body.
Since Lorely Circle haa taken new quar
ters in the Alcazar building the attend
ance has improved and Initiations are fre
quent. At the pace that this circle has
been moving at late it bid 3 fair to resume
the advanced position that it held for
many years in the order.

MOTHER HAD A
PRESENTIMENT OF
HER SON'S DEATH
Both Passed Away at
the Same Hour.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 13.â Mrs. Jeanette H.
Hopps had a presentiment of her Bon
James' tragic death at Vallejo a few
moments before she died in this city.
Singularly enough, the mother and son
passed away yesterday at almost the
same hour. Mrs. Hopps was 85 years of
age and in vigorous health for one of her
years. It was a surprise therefore when
she succumbed suddenly yesterday while
enjoying the society of her son and
daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Frank W.
Hopps. The cause of death was rheuma
tism of the heart.
Just previous to her demise Mrs. Hopps
had been talking of her son, James H.
Hopps. who was an employe at the Mare
Island Navy- yard. She wenried continu
ally about him and seemed to be fearful
that he had met with a fatal accident.
She said that she had a presentiment that
James was dead. A strange circumstance
is that Mrs. Hopps had seven children
living in different parts of the United
States and that her thoughts were only
of this particular one.
"Mother talked of no one but James,"
said Frank W. Hopps. She said, 'I am
sure something has happened to James. I
have a presentiment that he has-been
killed In an accident.' I asked her why
she thought so, and she said she could not
explain. She could only reiterate that
her son was dead and that she was sure
of It. "*
"While we were talking about it and I
vas trying to assure her that It was only
lancy on her part mother suddenly grew
faint, and despite all that we could do for
her she succumbed in a few moments. Her
death occurred just before 10 o'clock. It
was only a little after that when we got
a telephone message from Vallejo an
nouncing that James had been killed by
falling from a window. We had just dis
patched a message -to James informing
him of the death of his mother."
The body of the son was found beneath
a second-story window of his residence at
Vallejo. How he came to meet his death
is unknown, but the supposition is that
he accidentally fell from the window. He
was a native of Massachusetts, 52 years
of age, and leaves a widow and one child.
The funeral services of Mrs. Hoppa will
be held to-morrow morning at 11:30 o'clock
from her late residence, 2719 Central av
enue. Rev. Frank S. Brush of the First
Presbyterian Church will . officiate. The
funeral gathering of James H. Hopps will
meet that of the mother at the San Fran
cisco ferry and short services will bo held
at the Odd Fellows' Cemetery, where the
Interment of the two bodies will take
place. Â¦ â¢ ' :- ; â¢ Â¦ " ' ~

EMBALMING FLUID

Frank "Waters drank a glass of embalm

pain with his' life In danger. The pois
onous liquor was swallowed at the un
dertaking establishment of James Tay
lor. 520 Thirteenth street, and the griping
pains which It was Intended to alleviate
were followed by convulsions which
caused the most Intense pain.
The young man is employed by the un

mistake. "When the war with Spain broke
out he enlisted in the Fourteenth Infantry
and went with that regiment to the Phil

clung to him intermittently ever since.
Before enlisting he was employed by Mr.

of Arson.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 13.
Aged Robert Bishop is guilty of having
set fire to his place at Lorin in order to
reap the benefit of the insurance on the
place. That, at least, was the verdict of
a jury in Judge Greene's court to-day
after two previous trials at which the Jur
ors had disagreed and had been unmerci
fully roasted by the Judge, The crime
occurred in October of last year.
Â¦ The jury remained out from 2:la
this afternoon until shortly after 6 o'clock
and recommended the convicted man to
the extreme mercy of the court. That
the verdict might not be erroneous In its
most minute particulars, Judge Greene
had the jury polled. The result proved
the verdict. -, )Â¦'
Bishop was seated beside one of nls
daughters when the verdict was an
nounced, but he never flinched. He was
remanded to the custody of the Sheriff
an-A sentence will be pronounced next
Thursday morning.

PRISONERS UNMOVED UPON
LEARNING OF LOUCKS' DEATH
"Will Try to Prove an Alibi, Claiming
They Were in Bed When the â¢
Murder Was Done.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 13.â When J.
Teshara and M. Amaya were informed
to-day of the death of G. D. Loucks, whom
they are accused of having murdered,
they did not quiver a muscle. Teshara.
who is 25 years old, reported that he was
to be married to-morrow, and it is sup
posed the murder of Loucks might have
been prompted by the desire to secure
money with which to start housekeeping.
Although Loucks Â¦ positively identified
them both still insist in denying they had
anything to do with the crime. How
ever, they admit they were In the saloon
the night of the crime, but say they had
gone before the shooting took place. 'The
parents of the accused are ready to
swear the prisoners were In bed at the
hour it is claimed the crime was oom
mltted. The defense will try to prove an
alibi, and also that Loucks was near
sighted and unable to tell who did the
shooting.
The autopsy to-day revealed the fact
that Loucks had received two shots, one
in the breast and the .other in the stom
ach. Two wounds were found on the
head and one under the chin, penetrating
to the bone. It was Loucks' habit to dis
play money when making change. He car
ried about $100 in a leather pouch, the
amount being back pension money.
Loucks was a native of Michigan, aged
63 years. He served during the Civil
War in the Ninth Kansas Cavalry. He
was past commander of "Wallace Post,

The prisoners will be examined Friday.
BARK COLORADO
HIGH AND DRY
Goes Ashore on Beach
Of Johnsons Bay. â¢
Special Dispatch to TbÂ» Call. -
VANCOUVER. B. C; Feb. 13.â The bark
Colorado, which has been engaged for
several years in carrying ore from the
Treadwell mine in Alaska to the Tacoma
smelter, had a narrow escape on Monday
morning from going to the bottom with a
load of concentrates on board worth
nearly $100 000. As it was she ran on the
beach of Johnsons Bay and now has a
hole across her bows large enough to
drive a horse and buggy through. The
vessel was on her way south in tow of
the tug Lome, the largest of the Puget
Sound fleet. At 1:30 o'clock on Monday
morning the vessels were within fifty
miles. of Johnson Straits and Seymour
Narrows. - With fine, clear moonlight to
make navigation easy Captain Butler re
tired, leaving instructions with Pilot
Langley to call him if the weather
changed. At 3:30 a snow squall was en
countered. When Captain Butler awoke
at 4 o'clock with the shock of his vessel
striking the rocks he found that a email
bay had been entered In mistake for the
entrance to Seymour Narrows. The boat
was high on the beach. - The bark in tow
was swept forward by her own impetus
and the force of the tide and jammed in
on top of the stern of the Lome. The
weight of her fifteen hundred tons of ore
crushed her through for twenty feet of
her starboard bow, but ' fortunately the
hole was above the water line.
The great mass of falling ore and the
weight of the bow of the bark sunk the
stern of the tug, and as the tide went out
both vessels were in an almost hopeless
jam on the rocks. Fortunately the
steamer Wlllapa. which brought the news
of the disaster to the city -to-day, came
along during the forenoon and she suc
ceeded in towing the Colorado free 6t the
steamer and taking her to a safe anchor
age. It is a question whether the Colo
rado will be worth the repairs that will
be required to put her in a seaworthy
condition again.
The ore and wreckage was cleared oft
the stern of the Lome and with the flood
tide she raised and was floated off. She
Is how on her way down to Victoria,
whence another tug and barge will
be sent north to bring down the cargo
of the Colorado. The upper works of the
Lome* were badly damaged, but her
smash against the rocks was not sufficient
to drive a hole in her bottom.
VIGOROUS DENIAL
BY TALIAFERRO
Denounces Army Bacon
Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.-
Senator Taliaferro of Florida pronounces
as maliciously false. the charges made by
J. G. Holland, published. ln. a New Tork
newspaper this morning, alleging that he
had entered into .. collusion -with Major
Ruthers of the army in connection with
a meat contract. lie gave out this state
ment to-night;
"I state positively that I have never
had business transactions with Major
Ritfhers; never met him In company with
C. B. Rogers or any one else to discuss
business anywhere; never- purchased .or
discussed the purchase of meats or profits
thereon with Major Ruthers, either singly
or with others; never heard of the alleged
shipment of meat to Kingston, Jamaica,
or other West Indian ports until I saw
Holland's statement; and, therefore, I
pronounce the statement a tissue of mali
cious falsehoods from beginning to end.
"The motive of Holland's statement is
disclosed in these few words of the pub
lished story: 'Accordingly I came to
Washington and sought the counsel of a
well-known public man.' This 'well-known
public man' has been twice defeated by
the Legislature of ! Florida tor the office
of Senator and in his disappointment and
chagrin he seeks now to injure me through
the publication of false and malicious
charges."
SHE WANTS TEN

Trial of Mrs. Hunt's
Suit Begun.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway. Feb. 11
Instead of a "tooth for a tooth." Mrs.
Margaret G. Hunt wants $10,000 damages.
That, at least. Is the gist of a damage
sun of Mrs. Hunt against Dr. Walter F.
Lewis, a dentist of some note. Mrs. Hunt.
in her complaint, alleges that in Febru
ary, ISS7, she had employed Dr. Lewia
to pull a molar from her upper Jaw. She
claims. However, that the operation as
Performed by the manipulator and ex
tractor of masticators was so unskillf-.il
that an abcess formed in the cavity and
caused her pain and anguish way beyond
the imagination of the greatest sufferer.
Mrs. Hunt was on the stand this after
noon. On direct examination, conducted
by Attorneys Chapman and Clift, she re
lated the minor details of the peculiarly
objectionable molar extraction: and rm
cross-examination by Attorney W. R. Da
vis. ex-Mayor of Oakland, little was
brought out beyond the allegations in their
most mild strain. Attorney Davis, how
ever, proposes to show that Mrs. Hunt s
tooth was In such a state of ulceratlorx
that whatever Dr. Lewis might have
done would have terminated In the same
result on which Mrs. Hunt demands dam

DAISY F IS
DOWNED BY
CATASTROPHE
Biggest Upset of the Day at
Tanforanâ Three Choices
First.
One of the severest reverses suffered by
the talent at Tanforan Park yesterday
was the defeat by Catastrophe of the
odds-on favorite Daisy F. John Carroll's
mare was plunged, on at odds of 1 to 2 <to
win the mile and a sixteenth selling event,
and after galloping into the stretch be
fore her field, fell easy prey at the finish
to the 15 to 1 outsider. Catastrophe, ex
cellently ridden by Henry. Morinel show
ed a return of form by taking uw snow.
It was an "eagle bird" for the books, as
the winner ran practically unbacked.
Of the other favorites on the menu
Moonbright and Espionage were done to
a turn, winning extensively backed. Spen
cer led the jockeys with two winning
mounts. Â¦ .
A ragged assortment of platers started
in the first event, a seven-furlong, run,
the Boots entry, Senora Caesar, closing a
slight favorite over Lorao and Jazabel.
Miss Soak, a 6 to 1 chance, made the run
ning to the stretch, where Melkarth took
the lead, winning ridden out from ' the
favorite. The winner closed at odds of
5 to I. . ?-' t*
Ex-Jockey Johnny Weber's St. Carlo
filly Moonbright took the two-year-old
dash, starting favorite over Carlonian.
Leading from the start, she was ridden
out to beat the 100 to 1 shot Oh Time, with
Ames in the saddle. Away poorly, Intre
pido came fast at the close, securing the
show, v â¢:â¢>.'
W. I^arzelere placed a big commission
on his Silver Tone to win the mile and a
furlong run, and the betting public fol
lowed suit. Trailing Perseus most of the
way, Bullman took the* lead with Silver
Tone below the paddock, only to suffer a
reverse later, when Spencer brought* Sar
donic, winning by a head. The winner
was backed almost entirely for the place,
the first choice being considered a
"moral." :
Speedy Frank Bell had nothing to give
him a rub, taking his race at short odds.
Mortgage made a clever showing, beating
Hard Knot without effort for the place.
It was 8 to 5 and take your pick "be
tween Espionage and Alleviate to win the
final mile and a sixteenth purse run,
Ezell's mare was all the best, for when
Walsh called on her she assumed the
front position, downing Alleviate In a
common canter. The show fell .to Ein
steln. Â¦ â¢'Â¦"'
Track Notes.
A deputation of the San Mateo County
Super\-isors visited the track yesterday
and were Introduced to the game by Sec
retary Green.
Paplnta, the great mirror dancer, hold
ing the reins over a handsome pair' of
bays on the infield, was the cynosure of
many eyes.
It does not do for a poor owner to upset
a good thing at Tanforan.l Alter Catas
troph* had beaten Daisy P Prank Doss
boosted the winner to $1009. P. Sheridan
had no coin to protect his horse and lost
him. Doss hails from Texas and .former
ly trained the horses of "Kid" Weller. He
claims that Sheridan refused to give him
back some run-up money at Chicago last
summen, when Tappan was bid up, and
Catastrophe ran second. If this is a. crime
then Mr. Sheridan should lay the whole
matter before the stewards or the Amerl
can Turf Congress. The latter body
framed the selllng-rajce clause, and, dis
tort it as you may, It cannot be con
strued to read "that any owner whose
horse finishes second to a winner that Is
bid up and refuses to pay back his portion
of the money received through such ac
tion, shall In all future races be liable to
a bid-up hirrself."
The account of the klllinsr of Montgrom
ery and his various ownerships as pub
lished In an evening- paper erroneously
makes the horse once the property of
'"Pittsburg- Phil." Montgomery was bred
at the McGrathlana Btud, Lexington, Ky.,
by Milton Young, who owned both sire
and dam, Hanover-Blessing. The colt
Â¦was first named Confession. When a year
ling he was sold to Leigh & Rose, who,
after starting- him at Little Rock, won the
maiden race with him at Memphis. While
a. two-year-old at Saratoga he was pur
chased by Burns & Waterhouse, who
bought at the same time another Â¦well
tiled two-year-old, Glacier. Then ho be
came the property of â¢ Felix Carr. the
popular Jockey, from whom he passed to
William Magrane). who took him out of a
Belling race.

BOER ARGUMENT ENDS
IN STABBING AFFRAY
Thomas W. Bollet Seceives Injuries
Which May Hesult in. T"Â«
Death.
Thomas W. Rollet and Thomas Fahey,
alias Charch, engaged in an altercation
yesterday afternoon In a saloon kept by
Jack O'LÂ«ary at 723 Davis street, during
which Rollet wa* severely stabbed in the
abdomen and received injuries from which
he may die. Both of the men are team
eters In the employ of the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company. They entered
the saloon together about 4.30 o'clock to
take a drink. While they were discussing
a couple of schooners of beer their con
versation drifted to the Boer war. Evi
dently their opinions differed, for they be
came angry and Hollet made a pass at
Kahey. T"be latter was cutting a piece
of tobacco with an old rusty knife, and
when bis companion attempted to etrlke
him he made a lunge at him and cunk the
knife to the hilt in Rollet's abdomen.
The wounded man was taken to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital, where he was
attended by Dr. Frank Robinson and Dr.
Cherry who expressed the opinion that
on account of tbe condition of the weapon
blood poison will unquestionably -esult
from the wound. Fahey was arrested
by Officer Crosby and taken to the Cen
tral Police Station, where he will bÂ« held
pending the outcome of Rollet s wounds.
TO STAKE NOME BEACH.
Proposed Law That Ib Alarming
Hundreds of Miners.
Miners who contemplate digging wealth
from the Nome beach next apring? aro
somewhat alarmed over onÂ» clause of ' a
bill now before Congress regulating min
ing at Nome. This clause provides that
the beach may be staked off in claims.
The miners Bay that if this proposed law
Is adopted there will be room for com
paratively few men to -work on the sands
and that the vast number who 50 to
Nome expecting to make money from the
beach will be disappointed. The business
of tho town will bo Injured, too. by the,
failure of tbe disappointed ones to mako
money.
Another fear expressed by the miners Is
that people now going into Nome over
land will, expecting the law to pass, form
companies and stake off all the paying
beach, and that thus the profits of tho
sand diggings will reach the pockets of
still fewer.
Friends of the proposed law say It
should be adopted, as serious trouble may
arise on the beach if it cannot be definite
ly determined what each man owns.
NEARING COMPLETION.
Valley Road Getting Everything in
Readiness to Enter This City.
The progress of work on the Valley road
Is moving along, with great rapidity now
that the weather is such as to permit of
the construction being pushed right ahead
without any delay from water, soft earth
or the Ilko.
One continuous line of - track has been
laid from Stockton to the mouth of the
great Franklyn tunnel, a distance of fifty
two miles. The tunnel Itself is Jn such
shape that the rails can be extended Into
It and trains run through aa soon as those
having the work In hand desire.
Krorh the tunnel there remain only
eighteen miles of track to be put down
to connect Stockton with tide water at
Point Richmond. The grading and other
preliminary work on this stretch have
been completed, and nothing now re
mains for the laborers to do but place
the rails.
The wharf at Point Richmond Is now
finished with the exception of a few de
tails to be accomplished on the sllpa and
aprons, and these pieces will probably be
completed within the next two weeks. As
soon as they are done the heavy work of
the road â¢will be finished -with the excep
tion of that necessary to the laying of a
few miles of track beyond the tunnel.
It Is expected that the Ocean Wave .will
carry passengers from this , city to Point
Richmond In about forty-five minutes,
which will- make- the trip f rom â¢ here to
Stockton one of. about three or three and
a half hours' duration. . Â«

tion In this reception and of tho sincere
wish of hia Democratic friends and con
stituents of Fresno County that his abili
ties and usefulness may soon be deter
mined In the Senate of the United States,
and that when he returns and redellverq
his commission to the people of the State
we may feel a matter of satisfaction and
congratulation with his choice that we to
night have met to express."
Mr. Wallace paid a high tribute to Dr.
Rowell, who bo firmly supported Mr.
Bard, and concluded by expressing the
hope that the new Senator would dlstln
g-uish himself in Congress.
E. S. Van Meter spoke on behalf of the
Populist party, extending Mr. Bard a wel
come In the name of that organization.
He declared that Bard's election was a
grand victory for principle, a victory oÂ£
right over might. - Â¦-Â¦. -^ .
The next speaker was Frank h. Short,
the first Republican speaker of the even
ing. He congratulated the people or the
State upon the happy outcome of a dan
gerous situation and congratulated Mr.
Bard upon being the means to that end.
He aIBO paid a tribute to Senator Rowell
for. the light he had made In favor of
decency at Sacramento.
Senator Rowell was next called on and
made a brief speech telling of the contest
at Sacramento and explaining how the
battle In favor of principle was won. He
concluded by expressing his hearty ap
preciation of the reception tendered Mr.
Bard and concluded by introducing the
Senator.
"I am deeply touched," said. Mr. Bard,
"by this evidence of your good feeling
and confidence in me. I know that this
good feeling and confidence are at
tributable largely to your apprecia
tion of the character of my
friend and your friend, Dr. Rowell.
your- representative in the Senate.
I will not attempt to express my
self to-night. I am too much touched by
this demonstration. If my friend. Dr.
Rowell, has said to you of me that I am
a free man without entanglements of any
kind or of any character, no corporate
interests whatever, that I will, to the
best of my ability, attempt to discharge
the duties, great responsibility of the
office to which I have been elected, I
wish now here to say that I will confirm
all that he has said In my behalf and
that It will be my high ambition to carry
out and fulfill his and your expectations.
I desire to express In my feeble way my
appreciation of all this and to say that
I regard you as my friends, and . aa a
token of that! should like to grasp each
one of you by the hand and will attempt
to say. nothing. further."
A balf-hour- of handshaking followed.
Senator Bard- left â¢ for Ventura shortly
afterward.

Trouble.
BURGLARS AT WORK ON FRONT
p
Movements of Transports â Steamer
Irrawaddy Having a Hard Time,
Narrow Escape of the Ship
Louis Walsh.
The ex-transport Zealandia waa towed
to Martinez yesterday. She will be "laid
up" there for a month or so and then will
come back to San Francisco to be docked
and got ready for the Nome trade.
For several weeks past it was thought
that the Zealandia would be sent to
Honolulu to relievo the glut of trade to
the Hawaiian Islands, but as the plague
is now almost stamped out the local
steamers can handle the business, so the
Zealandia will go into retirement until
the opening of the Nome trade.
She was towed to Martinez yesterday by
the tug's Sea King and Sea "Witch. Be
yond the Brothers the river schooner
Robert and Jennie was met In a water
logged condition. She had left San Fran
clsco with a load of lumber for Stockton,
but, drifting down on a hidden rock near
the brothers, she sprang a leak and be
came waterlogged. The tugs towing tha
ZeaJanUla. saw ncr signals of distress and,
altering their course, went alongside.
Ca.pta.ln Johnson of the schooner said ha
was In no immediate danger, so the tug 3
proceeded on their -way.
As soon as tho Zealandia was taken to
her anchorage the Sea Witch cast off and
went back to the assistance of the Robert
and Jennie. She waa picked up when her
decltload was awash and tho captain and
crew had taken to the rigging for safety.
Captain Dave Shaw oÂ£ the Sea Witch
towed the derelict to the Mission flats.
where she was run ashore. Xo-day her
load of lumber will be unloaded, after
which she will go on the ways for an
overhauling.
One of the boldest attempts at burglary
ever made on the front was accomplished
ea-rly yesterday morning. The offices at
44 East street were entered and money
and goods stolen while n desperate effort
was made to break into the saloon, res
taurant and dry goods store on the
ground floor. Ifotfilng but the Iron door
and shutters on the ground floor saved
the place rrom being looted.
All the offices on the upper floor of the
building are being remodeled, and the
thieves evidently expected to find the
carpenters' tools there when they broke
In. Had they done so they would have
cut their way through the ceiling and
made a raid on the store below. In the-
Favorite saloon, run by J. H. Flathmann,
there Is a great play on the nlckel-ln-the
slot machines, and this seems to be the
objective point of the thieves. Failing to
break in through the ceiling-, they went
through the offices of Captain Cogan. who
is fitting out the bark Alaska for a trip
to Cape Nome; Captain Charles A. Mc-
Phee. the stevedore; B. -H. Tietjen, man
ager of. the tug Ida W, and Charles
Meyer, the tailor. Captain Cogan Is J2iX>
richer by leaving his gate unlocked. Ho
had two minutes to catch his boat and
ran for It, leaving tho Bafe Closed but not
locked.
The J t w e u es .f. f ? una v that way ana
passed it by with the comment that an
open safe never contained money In
Tietjen & MePhee's offce they If '$22 iÂ£
cash and ? 2 50 in postage and revenue
Stamps; in Meyer's place they secured
two bolts of cicth and the.n thpy turned
their attention to the lower floor They
tore the woodwork away from the porch
of the Favorito saloon with a spade and
then forced an entrance throush tho
zinc lining around the sink. Crawling
through the hole, they found Iron doors
and Iron shutters barring the way and
failing to burst these open, they made
their escape. The Favorite is one of the
best patronized places on the front, and
had the burglars gained an entrance they
would have made a haul.
The transport Leelanaw loaded horses
and mules for Manila yesterday. She will
probably sail to-day. The St Paul
docked at Harrison street yesterday. She
will be fitted out for the Nome trade at
once. Tho transport Thomas Is coaling
and she will be ready to sail In a week.
The Sherman- was to sail to-morrow with
a general cargo and 400 casuals, but it will
be next week before she gets away.
The American steamer Irrawaddy
which put into the Bermudas for repairs'
lost her Jibboom, started her knight heads'
and sustained other damage during a
storm on January 25-6. At one time there
was twelve feet of water In the fore and
eight feet In the second hold. All hands
thought the steamer would go down.- so
there was general rejoicing when the Ber
mudas were reached. The Irrawaddy has

HOW WHISKY
WAS DRUNK ON
THE MANAUENSE
Bad Day for Engineer
McDonald.
PROSECUTION HAS CLOSED
Assistant Engineer Walters Says the
Difficulty. Was Not Water Com
ing In, but How to Get
It Out.
The Investigation of the Manauense
matter proceeded before tho British Con
sul and his naval court yesterday as
far as the conclusion of the prosecution
and the start of the defense. The prose
cutlon finished its case rather unexpect
edly, too, for It was supposed there was a
long string of witnesses In its train. Ihe
defense proceeded as far as its third wit
ness. Assistant Engineer Walters. Wai
ters' testimony went Into all of tlia
charges, but it was most Interesting in Its
references to affairs In tha engineer's de
partment.
The mornlngr session was taken up main
ly with the amount of whisky an engineer
can drink and still run his engine prop
erly and look out for his flreroom fore^.
All the morning's testimony . and a. good
Eart of that of the afternoon waa alco
olic. C. G. Stlmpson, the Manila, agent
of the ship, told how ho had seen McDon
ald drunk twice while the Manauense waa
lying in Manila. He said he knew noth
ing about the condition of the ship, but
from what he saw of the engineer he did
not think him fit for duty.
A. Hart, a purser, was then called to
tell of the bibulous goings on aboard the
ship. He eaid McDonald's bill at the bar
for the trip out and back amounted to
$20. There was a bill for champagne of
$1.50 out of this, however, a email bottla
of the effervescent having 1 been opened by
the engineer on one occasion of Import
ance: and having: set apart this item, the
conclusion was arrived at that tho re
mainder of the bill was for red liquor.
The purser told further how on two oc
casions at least he had refused to sell
liquor to McDonaldâ once because McDon
ald was already drunk, and again when
he had been drinking. It waa a DOttH
McDonald wanted each time, and Hart
said he had given the engineer a urlnk
while he had refused to sell him a bottle.
Hart also told how McDonald used to get
liquor for his men in the engine room
when they Â¦were working in the water
that had come in, but he remembered that
the men had been working in the -water
every time liquor was asked for for them.
John Johnson, the third officer, openei
the defense. He had never seen the en
gineer drunk, nor anything? like it, and
he said so In a somewhat hesitating way.
for although he is third officer of the ship.
he has hardly that rank In tho Queen 8
English. The prosecution, under crosa
examlnatlon, tried to show that the third
officer had been sent to his room because
ho was drunk at Manila, but they failed.
They also failed to show that the third
officer and the enÃineer had ever nad a
drink together. Johnson testified that he
had held the ranK of first lieutenant in the
Norwegian navy.
The Missouri reached port Monday night and was at once placed In quarantine. Early yesterday she waa released,
and anchored off the Presidio wharf, where the sick soldiers will be landed. '.:.;:
she is Intended for the San Francisco-
Cape Nome trade.
The ship Louis Walsh had a narrow
escape from total- destruction In Oyster
Bay. She was helping to salve the careo
of the wrecked collier Miami, when she
broke adrift and went on the reef, bhe
was grot off the next day with the loss of
her anchor and seventy feet of chain.

SIHPTON CREATED ASTONISHMENT
Told Town Trustee A. Sylva Last August That He Had
Performed the Ceremony.
WTmJB the attorneys representing Mrs. Craven's Interests are exceed
ingly reticent as regards what their next move in the celebrated
Craven-Fair litigation will be, it Is known from the statement of a
person who is in possession of many facts bearing on the case that
they Intend springing somÂ« sensational testimony in proof of their contention
that their client Is the wife of the deceased James O. Fair. This person is
A- 9ylva, a Town Trustee of Sausalito, who bears witness that last year
Recorder &eorge W. Simpton of Sausalito stated that he had married the de
ceased Senator and Mrs. Craven In 1592 and had taken his affidavit to that
effect, which waa given Into the keeping- of Attorney W. W. Foote.
According to Sylva. Mrs. Craven's lawyers are in possession of leaves from
a. dozen hotel registers of various towns In the State in which Fair himself
bÂ»d ma-dc the entry. "James O. Fair and wife," as well as the affidavits of
persons who saw Mrs. Craven with him at the- time these entries were made,
end are thus ready to testify that the word wife referred to Mrs. Craven. In
â¢onie way or other those who are contesting: Mrs. Craven's claim for a
widow's allowance from the Income of the estate have become aware of these
facets and are in consequence considerably exercised.
Early yesterday morning Recorder Simpton received a telephonic message
at Sausalito to come to this city. He took the 10:15 a. m. boat and when
hÂ« reached Ban Francisco presumably met Mrs. Craven's legal advisers. He
did not return to Sausalito last evening-
After the last boat had left the Marln shore Trustee Sylva also received a
message' to come to this city. He took a launch and arriving at Clay-street
wharf disembarked and took a car uptown. Leaving the car in front of the
PaiTOtt building Sylva went to Charles Fair's office, where he was closeted
â¢with 6evÂ«ral persons until a late hour.
"Some- time last fallâ l think It was In August or Septemberâ Judge- Simp
ton, one of Mrs. Craven's attorneys, and myself were engaged in conversa
tion at the Sausalito wharf." said Sylva, "when the question of the Craven-
Fair case came up. After we had talked about Its various aspects for a short
time Simpton said: 'If you will pay nothing about it I will tell you some
thing that will surprise you.' I promised, and he told me that he had married
Senator Fair and Mrs. Craven In 1532 and at their earnest request had kept
the affair a secret. He further said that a short time previous to our conver
sation he had miÂ«Je an affidavit that he had performed the ceremony, at the
recuest of Attorney W. W. Foote, and had given the aflldavlt into Foote' s
keeping. Simpton declared that he had never told this to anybody before
and asked me to cay nothing about It until It came out In court It U now
out. and I suppose thÂ© oblig-atlon of secrecy imposed on me is no longer In
force.
"The attorney present at the time then said that Mrs. Craven's lawyers
were in possession of leaves taken from a dozen hotel registers throughout
the State, In which Fair had made the entry. 'James G. Fair and wife.' Affi
davits of certain persons who saw Mrs. Craven with him when these entries
were made, I was further told, are In the possession of Mrs. Craven's law-
The affidavit referred to by Sylva Is Known to be In existence and has been
seen by several persons. It is stated on the authority of a person who read
the document that it was not taken at the request of Attorney Foote, but that
Judge Simpton -went to the lawyer's office and voluntarily offered to make it.
Prior to that time he had refused to have anything to do with the case.
The affidavit is now in the possession of Attorney Lafe Pence and will be
produced la court.

RIOT CLOSES A DAY OF
SENSATIONAL INCIDENTS
Mrs. Craven's Maintenance Suit
Sets Factions Battling.
Claimant Testifies That She Was Married
to Senator Fair by Judge Simpton
of Sausalito and Has Her Proofs.
J^^m BANK 'MB^'
WOMEN screaming with terror,
tha muffled Impact or swing
ing fists, the curses of men
and the warbling of police
Â¦whistles has thrown the
case by which Mrs. Nettle R,
Craven seeks to establish her contention
that she ie the widow of the late James
G. Fair into the circle of reigning sensa
tion*. It was thought that the case had
been thraehed out during the trial of ac
tions settled and grone, but Mrs. Craven's
statement on the stand yesterday that
her marriage to Senator Fair, by con
tract. had been subsequently ratified
through the performance of a. regular
ceremony, in which Judge G. W. Slmpton
or BauEallto officiated, threw the opposi
tion Into a condition approaching dismay.
A few minutes later the court ordered an
adjournment until this morning, as J. W.
Barling, a friend of the claimant and her
Attorneys, had been assaulted in the ro
tunda of the City Hall by two' private de
tectives and beaten into a. condition bor
dering on Insensibility. The assault on.
Mr. Barling was not unexpected by him
or his friends, but that it should come
Curing the period of a temporary recess
occasioned surprise, and the truth of the
tfsault expressions of regret and condem
nation.
At the opening session of the court Mrs.
Craven stated that ehe objected to the re
moval of her contract of marriage from
tbo court by the opposition, but she con
sented that the document be taken to the
etudip of Theodore Kytka that it might
be photographed for the benefit of the
defence. All parties In Interest adjourned
to Mr. Kytka's studio, the photographs
were taken, and at the opening of the af
ternoon session Mrs. Craven took the
stand. She testified that she had shown
the marriage contract she alleges bound
ber to Senator Kair. during decedent's
life time, to her friends Mrs. Purcell. Mrs,
Johnson, Daniel O'Connell, Judge Sullt-
Tan, LÂ«e D. Craig, her daughter. Marga
ret Koehler. Mr. McArthur and others
Â¦whoBo names she was unable to recall at
the time. This contract was drawn up
ia Juno or 1822, and It was during a visit
to New York that she made its contents
known to her daughter. . In answer to
questions of Lafe Pence, who Is caring
tor her Interests, Mr 6. Craven further
testified that the marriage was subse
quently ratified by Senator Fair and ner
celf in the presence of Judge G. W. Simp
ton of Sauealito In the month of July, 1X92.
This evidence went before the court under
various objections, and a following ques
tion calling for Mrs. Craven's testimony
as to whether or not she occupied the
earne room with the deceased millionaire
on the night following the ratification of
the marriage resulted In a recess. Coun.
sel representing the Fair executors and
heirs objected on the ground that the fact
that they occupied the same room did not
establish the marriage, and. in order to
enable both Fides to present their views
on the issues established by this fact, the
court granted a recess. Mrs. Craven and
her daughter walked down the hail. Mr
Barling, accompanied by Mrs. Craven's
friend, Mrs. Ruggles. went to view the
rotunda. Both were standing near the
rail, when Mr. Barling saw that he was
being watched by tÂ». J. Curtin, a nephew
of Captain Curtin of a local detective
agency. Barling turned toward Curtin
and In an Instant the fight was on. Young:
Curtln. with the assistance of another of
Curtin's men, jumped Barling. Half a
dozen blows were exchanged and Barling
fell. A few well directed kicks left him
prostrate and bleeding on the marble
floor.
Young Curtln and his confederates were
yet uneatlsfiea and they kept up the fight.
Mrs. Ruggles screamed for help and In
an instant almost a crowd ol men were
surging toward the scene of battle. An
unknown man broke through the door and
the crowd, fearing a gun fight, parted.
By tbls time Theodore Kytka, the hand
wrlting expert, was trying to pull Curtin
off his prostrate enemy. A. bystander
stepped in and In a minute Barling was
being: cared for by friends. Curtin and
his assistant were allowed to go. and they
rushed for freedom. Now above the din
was heard Attorney Fence's voice. "Why
don't you call your gang off?" he said.
addressing Attorney Heggerty, who is
representing Charles L. Kair. "I don't
Know who ia responsible for this," said
Heggerty. "Well, we will put you on
the stand and find out," answered Fence,
and the crowd then followed Barling into
the law library. Barling -was bleedlnj
and bruised and as he entered the library
he was met by Mrs. Koehler. "We can't
have a friend in the world," was all that
Mrs. Koehler said. Barling -was taken to
the hospital for treatment and then the
pursuit of his assailants began.
Theodore Kytka. with a cobble In hl3
hand, had followed -young- Curtln, and
they played a game of hide and seek until
MoeÂ« Watacnberg of 1004 Golden. Gate
avenue got on the track of the fugitive,
whom he pointed out to Officer Joy, who
arrested him, and, with Detectives Wren
and Dinan, charged him with an assault
with intent to (Jo great bodily harm, A
short time later Captain Curtln appeared
on the Bcene. "It s a pity they didn't
kill him," said Captain Curtln: "he's been
hounding these young men for weeks
past." Curtln put up $100 for the release
at his nephew and they left the prison.
In the meantime Mrs. Craven had re
turned to court, but owing to the excite*
ment the court was of- the opinion that
a continuance would benefit all parties
and he ordered an adjournment until 11
o'clock this morning. Doubtless the cause
of the trouble will bo the subject of Ju
dicial Investigation and more injudicious
squabbling.
