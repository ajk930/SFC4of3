LONDON, Feb. 25, 3:55
p. m. â Lord Roberts has
sent the following addi
tional advices to the War Office:
"PAARDEBERG, Saturday.
Feb. 24. â Methuen reports that
Barckley West was occupied by
our troops on February 22. The
loyal inhabitants displayed great
enthusiasm. The country- west of
the railway from Cape Town to
Kimberley is gradually settling
down. A detachment has started
from De Aar for Britstown, and
Douglas and Prieska will shortly
be visited by our troops.
"Methuen's account of the ad
mirable manner in which the
Kimberley hospital is managed
made one desire to send some of
our sick and wounded there."
The Times publishes the fol
lowing from Paardeberg, dated
Wednesday, February 21 : "Gen
eral Cronje's forces have good
cover from the British artillery
fire and have considerable stores
of provisions."
A dispatch to the Morning
Post from Kimberley, dated Fri
day, says: "General Cronje is re
ported to have plenty of provis
ions, but to be running short of
ammunition. Mr. Rhodes is ex
tremely hopeful that the war has
reached its concluding stage."
The Times publishes the fol
lowing dispatch from Colenso, I
dated Saturday: "The British are
now within two miles of being in
touch with Ladysmith, but the
ground still to be covered is the
hardest part and very severe
fighting must be expected."
STERKSTROOM, Sunday,
F c b 25. â A reconnoissance yes
terday, in force under General
Gatacre, with eight guns, found
the Boers occupying a ridge
three miles beyond Molteno, in
the Stormberg direction. Mont
morency's scouts charged the
Boers, who crept around the
scouts' flank, pouring in a deadly
fire. The scouts were finally com
pelled to retire, having lost heav
ily. Fourteen are missing. Cap
tain de Montmoreney was killed.
The reconnoissance was valuable
and would have been most satis
factory had it not been for the
unfortunate disaster of the
scouts, with whom Lieutenant
Colonel Hoskier happened to be.
Their loss was four killed and
many wounded and missing.
General Gatacre has issued a
divisional order, announcing the
killing of Captain de Montmor

COLONIAL CAVALRYMEN
QUIT BRITISH SERVICE
CAPE TOWN, Saturday, Feb. 24.â
Within the last few days 200 prisoners
have arrived here and preparations are
/being made to receive large numbers. Of
ficers and men have been dispatched to
Walfisch Bay. where It Is reported that
Boer munitions are being landed. It Is
said that about oO per cent of the first
five squadrons of Brabant's Horse have
taken their discharges, having completed
their engagement for three months. Va
rious reasons are given.
LONDON. Feb. 26.â The Standard has
the following from Cape Town, dated
Saturday:
"The Boer force occupying Prieska con
sisted of 120 rebels led by Free Staters. A
proclamation has been read annexing the
Prieska district to the Free State, and all
loyal British have been given eight days
to quit the r place. I an assured by refu
gees from Prieska that unless troops are
speedily sent there the whole northwest
ern district will rise."
The Lourenzo Marques correspondent
of the Times says:
"The feeling In official circles at Pre
toria borders on consternation. General
Louis Bctha and President Steyn are both
urging President Kruger to sue for peace. :
At Bloemfonteln General Cronje's posi
tion Is regarded as hopeless."
SACRIFICE OF LIFE
NOT MADE IN VAIN
'LONDON." Feb. 26.â Spencer Wilkinson.'
Â¦ reviewing ths military situation in the
Morning Post, says:
..".The- probabilities, are that the Boers
have not been able to collect a large force
to attack Lord Roberts. General Cronje's
surrender may occur at any moment. But
the Boer commander knows what he Is do
ing; he Is not sacrificing lives for nothing.
Every day he can hold out means the de
lay of a day in Lord Roberts' advance
and the gain of a day for the besieger*
of Ladysmith. Therefore. Lord Roberts
Is acting rightly In tightening his icrip In
order to hasten the removal of General
Cronje's ' force, and General Buller's ad
vance Is the best help that can be given
Lord Roberts." _

As soom as the kopje was evacuated I

Our first contact with the LadysmÃh
Boers was singularly unfortunate for
them. A great deal of forage, provisions

Everybody admires the splendid stand
of the burghers, but from a humanitarian
point of view, it is considered that further
resistance on tho part of General Cronje
will be criminal. Every shrapnel shell

P To-day Lord Roberts sent General
Cronje an offer of a. safe conduct for the
women and children, together with a free
pass to any point for. them, and also an
offer of doctors and medicine. Cronje's
reply was- a. curt refusal, and- desultory
shefling was resumed. Artillery shelling
continued during the- early part of " last
night. As soon as 'the 'last gun. was fired
the Shropshlres, who had been occupying
the river bed since Sunday, rushed for
ward, seized an additional 200 yards of
near ground, and entrenched a fresh po

the mules of the Eighty-second Battery,

off en masse, but to-day the wagons, with
one exception, were recovered.
General French has sent In seventy-five
prisoners. A British patrol, eight miles
to the west, discovered thirty Boers wan

this force has captured 460 of the enemy,

The Boer prisoners are all depressed at

ROBERTS HAS TAKEN
FIVE HUNDRED BOERS
LONDON*. Feb. 26, 4:30 a. m.â Perhaps
never before in the course of the present
campaign have such crowds visited the
War Office as went there yesterday. As
the Times remarks to-day, "the dearth of
news Is somewhat trying at a time when
a. considerable success was generally re
garded as imminent."
Â¦ No diminution of confidence In Lord
Roberts is felt, however, and the public
Is ready to believe that he had good rea
sons for not mentioning General Cronja
in the official dispatches. Probably he Is
in no hurry to end a situation which Is
daily bringing small parti.es of Boers in a
ivaln endeavor to reinforce General Cronje.
These he can deal with in detail.
Lord Roberts haa already captured over
500 Boers, and at this rate he will soon
have quite a respectable array of prison
ers to hold as hostages for the 3000 Brit
ish already In Pretoria.
General Cronje's refusal to arcept the
offer of Lord Roberta regarding .' the
women and children indicates either that
the position is less desperate than has
been supposed or that he has been able
to dig an absolutely safe place for. them.
Everything goes to show that General
Buller's advance Is' most stubbornly .con
tested and most cautiously ,. carried out.'
It is hoped that he will soon be in a po
sition where General White will be able
to assist him materially.
- The campaign Is now approaching a
most Interesting phase. In about a fort
r.igtit the Congress of the Afrikanderbund
will meet, and It Is rumored that. Mr.
HoJTmeier will then propose peace terms
on the basis of the republics retaining ab
solute Independence, but offering to dis
arm. If these terms are rejected. It la
understood, a manifesto will be boldly Is
sued to the Dutch throughout South Af
rica calling upon them to throw oft their
allegiance to Great Britain. Probably
these rumors are exaggerated, but there
Is no doubt that the greatest anxiety pre
vails in Cape Town regarding -coming
events.
Germany, through the semi-official Ber
liner Post, reiterates that all reports- of
German Intervention are quite without
foundation:

SKULL CRUSHED ON
A GRANITE CURBING
Street Fight in San Diego Ends in
the Death of One of the â¢ .
' . -Contestants.
?P'dal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 25.â Harry Lynell
ivas arrested this noon at his home, on
.he corner of Columbia and Date streets,
md a charge of murder will be placed
against him in Justice Murdock's court
to-morrow. The cause of the arrest was
the death of Luzerae L. Roberts this
morning at his home at the corner of
Eighteenth and H streets.
Lynell Is an auctioneer, whose place of
Â»uslness has been on Sixth street, not far
from G street. It is not likely that he will
3e enabled to return to that business for
some time. He has been given to drink
and had been drinking yesterday after
noon just before bt-ing approached by
Roberts, who came to inquire as to a bill
which it is claimed that Lynell owed. A
impute about the bill followed, and blows
resulted. Bystanders separated the com
batants, but they got together again, and
were agarn separated. A third time the
two came together, and then Roberts
went down from a blow on the side of the
rheek. His head went back and as he
fell the back of his head struck on the
side of the granite curbing. Lynell was
nulled away from the fallen man and
Roberts was able to pet up and recah his
home. He did not believe that he was
seriously hurt, though he complained of
his hÂ« j ad hurting him. He went Immedi
ately to bed. but complained of his head,
which got no better, and about midnight
Dr. Hunt was called. Soon afterward
Roberts became unconscious, and re
mained so. Dea..h resulted at a little be
fore it o'clock thjs morning.
The Illness and death had all the appear
ances of a rase of apoplexy, and it is
probable that that would have been the
statement on the certificate, for Roberts
had told nothing of his, meeting with .Ly
nell nor of the difficulty which resulted. '
As soon, however, as the news of the
death was reported on the street, some of
those who- had known of the altercation
lwgan to wonder if there was any. con
nection between the two. The wonder
ment resulted in an investigation and an
autopsy, which showed that the skull had
been crushed badly near the base of the
brain, where the man's head came in con
tact with the curbing.
BIG MEDICINE DANCE
OF YAKIMA INDIANS
Fprlal Diypatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Wash.. Feb. 21â The Yaklma
Indians held a big medicine dance last
week, which lasted seven days. Three
dozen redskins started cut to dance for
a week. The third day they began drop
ping out and continued doing so until only
one remained at the beginning of tho
reventh day. He was a wiry young Ya
kima, nearly 30 years old, and was made
chief tribal medicine man for a term of
three. years.
During this dance, as in times past, the
dancers hacked and cut their flesh with
knives and prongs until blood flowed
freely from numerous wounds. Heavy
leather strings were drawn under the
striprs cut in the flesh. â¢ The dancers
would then pull the strings until the flesh
pulled apart. None are allowed to eat
while dancing, turning the ceremony into
an ordeal of physical suffering of the
most frightful character. Blood flowed
from scores of wounds until the floor of
the dancing lot was turned crimson.
The object of the Indians is to suffer un
til the Â«vil spirits leave their body, mak
ing them pure and meok. To them this
dance is deeply religious, and every part
of the rlto Is carried out with great ex
actness. A small civilized portion of the
tribe refused to have any part In the
?-vent. On the othrr hand, among the
dancers were three young sub-chiefs who
were educated in Indian schools in the
East and Oregon, and who on returning
have discarded civilisation for blankets
and tribal customs.

hol and oil stores, a series of explosions
occurred, spreading the llames until a
block of six immense warehouse was in
volved in a huge conflagration.
A' great concourse of spectators had as
sembled and had approached too near,
when suddenly the explosion occurred. A
large number of persons, including some
firemen, were more or less injured. The.
last explosion occurred at 6 o'clock this
afternoon, when it was thought that
much danger had been averted. Thirty
persons were injured by flying debris.
The official computation shows that 150
were hurt and quite a number seriously.
The fire broke out at 8 o'clock, from
some cause as yet unknown, and had ob
iainefl .avllrm hold before, It was discov
ered.' it progressed y,;lth'^ut exciting In
cidents during the hioYnirig. and at 1
o'clock had been got under control. At 4
o'clock, however.- the falling walls per
mitted the flames to reach a number of
alcohol vats, and then the explosions be
gan to take, place.
The block of- warehouses was almost
surrounded by unoccupied ground, over
which the burning alcohol spread when
the buildings collapsed, resembling a sea
of flames End causing consternation
throughout the district. People in the
dwellings near by began hastily remov
ing their furniture. The suffocating heat
and fumes seriously hampered the work
of the tire brigade. A number of engines
were sent from Paris to assist. The fire
men worked fearlessly: and more than
once were precipitated to the ground by
falling roofs and walls.
A detachment of soldiers aided the fire
men In emptying the adjacent houses of
furniture, and the ambulances were busy
In carrying victims to the neighboring
hospitals. .
Fortunately the flames did not reach
the immense reservoirs of pertroleum.
The loss is estimated at 2,000,000 francs.
dlft'erenc3s which have arisen on the Re-
publican side of the chamber. It had been
arranged that the debate should proceed
Monday night, but this must give way to
the Republican conference in the hall of
the House at 8 p. m.,- when a final effort
will be made to reconcile* differences and
agree upon a compromise bill.
The Alabama contested ''election case of
Aldrich against Robblns will* be consid
ered as soon as the Porto Rlcan bill is out
of the way. The army appropriation bill
will receive consideration the latter part
of the week/ Owing -to the extent of the
military afiairs in the Philippines tho ap
propriations this year are exceptionally
heavy and this may bring on a general
discussion of army affairs and the Philip
pines.
It is not likely that the Hawaiian bill
or the Nicaraguan canal bill will bt taken
up this week.
Currency Bill in Senate.
'*â¢ Senator Aldrich has given notice that
he will make a speech In the Senate in ex
planation of the currency bill agreement
oiv Wednesday, and that he will call it up
the next day (Thursday) and then ask
final action upon it. The request of course
will lead to, a spirited contest. The mat
ter may be before the Senate for several
days. .'Â¦ ;, Â¦ v
There will be several . speeches during
the week, on the Quay resolution, and
there is a probability" of reaching a vote
on it the latter part of the week. Sena
tor Chandler will probably speak for Quay
Monday and Senator Turley In opposition.
Later In the week - Senators Hoar and
Penrose will talk for. Quay and Senator
Burrows in opposition.* 1 After these, only
short speeches v/ill be heard. Senator
Penrose counts upon a vote late in the
week and says he expects a larger vote
than was cast in Quay's favor in takin;?
the 'resolution up.
When the Hawaiian bill, which remains
the unfinished business. Is voted upon, the
Porto Rican bill will be taken up. Sena
tor Depew on Tuesday will speak on the
problems connected with the Philippine
Islands.
REPUBLICANS FAIL
TO REACH AGREEMENT
Representatives Will Continue Their
Efforts, However, to Unite on
the Porto Rican Bill.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.â The efforts to
unite the Republicans of the House on a
Porto Riean bill have failed, and at mid
night, after prolonged conferences. It was
stated that matters were substantially
where they were yesterday. Other efforts
at harmony may be adopted to-morrow.
A long conference was held to-nisrht at
the residence of Representative McCall
of Massachusetts between the committee
appointed at the Republican' conference
last night, representing the Republicans
in favor of the ponding Porto Rlcan tariff
bill, and a committee agreed upon to-day
by those Republicans who are opposed to
the measure. It was stated after the
conference, by members opposed to the
bill, that substantially Â¦ no progress ''has
been made and that there was no proba
bility of another gathering ' before the
conference of Republicans called for'to
morrow night. From their statements it
was evident that they Intended to main
tain the position they have held all along
âthat under the constitution the Govern
ment has no right to tax the products of
territory under the control of the United
States.

able to propel himself about the room in his Invalid chair. Despite the
statements of specialists that a man like Duryea with his neck broken at ,
the fifth vertebra could not live, he has gained sixty-five pounds since h#
submitted to the surgeon's knife, and Is now within twenty pounds of hia

BOSTON, Feb. 25.â Philip Scully, once a
coachman for the Barnard family, and
later the husband of the heiress of. the
family, Jessie Amelia Barnard Scully of
Fall River, has. It is alleged, deserted a
young, cultured and pretty wife, and on*
who has a fortune of more than $150,000
in her own right, and. It is alleged, that
a woman unknown to Mrs. Scully figures
In the case of his going away. Mrs. Scully
Is now suing for a decree which will, if
granted, give her the right to live apart
from her husband for justifiable cause.
The petitioner, through her counsel, has
asked for the custody of her three chil
dren, and If her prayers to the probate
court are granted, it is thought that she
will ask for an absolute divorce.
This is the end of a romance which set
Fall River by the ears ten years ago; It
Is the culmination of a runaway marriage.
Philip Scully Is supposed to be In the
West and as long as he stays away there
will be no intent exhibited to put him
within the pale of the law, but if rre
should come back, according to the. state
ment of a friend of the family, he may
have to answer to a charge which Is at
present kept secret. If society In Fall
River was shocked at the famous run
away match, it was shocked again yester
day to an equal: degree by the knowledge
that legal proceedings would again bring
the family romance before the courts.

BOERS TRY TO BREAK
THROUGH TO CRONJE
PAARDEBKRG. Saturday, Feb. 24.â Yes
terday there was a most interesting series
of fights along the British front. One
thoufand Boers, commanded by General
de Wet. who were known to be operating
in the immediate front, at early dawn
yesterday determined to attempt to break
through the British lines and aid General
Cronje. A body of live hundred Boers
mnvpil toward the". British left and can
ten-d in the direction of a kopje with the
object of occupying It. Unfortunately for
the Boers, however, the kopje was held
by a company of Scottish borderers, who
opened a heavy lire. The Boers "galloped
off. but moved aguin toward another Brit
ish position, with exactly the same result.
Then they made a third attempt to oc
rupy another position, but the borderers
wore apain ready to receive them.
The third Tcpulse thoroughly discon
certed the B<wrs. who galloped away in
a panic. Lat^r perceiving another kopje
the Boers moved quickly toward it. This
kopje was unoccupied, but the borderers,
not to be beaten, raced the Boers for the
position and' won. occupying- the - kopje
and driving off the Boers. A portion of
the latter ultimately occupied a kopje
flanked partially by the borderers and
facing another kopje held by the York
shires. A vigorous fullisade ensued, the
British firing truly and accurately and
succeeding in silencing the Boer tire.
Meanwhile the Buffs were ordered to re
inforce the Yorkshires in case the Boers
should be reinforced. The British attack
worked around to the right of the kopje
held by the Yorkshires, where the
Seventh Battery was stationed, the Sixty-
Rpcond Battery being placed at a farm
near the center of the borderers' position.
A vigorous shelling, accompanied by a
British fusillade, completely silenced the
Boers. A company of Yorkshires were
sent to clear out the Boers, but the at
tempt failed, the Boers opening a heavy
lire, and the British having no cover.
The British then again opened a heavy
rifle fire, which again silenced the Boers.
The Boer? made -several attempts to run,
but the Maxims opened upon them effect
ually and checked them. The Buffs now
worked carefully and cautiously around
nnd set within 150 yards of the Boers.
Kifchty Boers surrendered, but many, it
appear.', escaped. . â¢ .

Three Hundred of General Torres'
Soldiers Fall Before Bullets
of the Yapis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POTAM, Sonora, Mex.. Feb . 25.â Another big battle has been fought by
Mexican regulars and Yaqui Indians. The battle, raged all day Friday.
The loss on the Mexican side was 300 killed ' and wounded. Among the
dead was Gcronimo Ascarate of El Paso, Tex. '
The Yaqui forces, 4000 strong, descended from mountain strongholds with the
Intention of assaulting Guaymas. General Torres was Informed in advance of the
Intention of the hostiles by Geronimo Ascarate. who was in the employ of the
Mexican Government at Casa Grandes, Mex., not far from the seat of the
Yaqui Government at Habispe. Ascarate was sent to convey the news to
Torres and participate in the battle.
General Torres concentrated his forces, numbering 6000 men, at Potam on
Thursday, and divided them equally. One division was sent up the river with the
gunboat Democrata. The other was swung to the northeast for the purpose of
flanking the enemy. Thirteen miles from Potam River the force, which was
commanded by Torres personally, encountered the Indians, well fortified. The
soldiers assaulted the works and the gunboat threw shells from the river.
The Indians had procured a Maxim gun from the United States, which is sup
posed to have been smuggled in with mining machinery, and this was used to
good advantage. The Mexicans were repulsed In disorder, and the Indians
swept the decks of the Democrata at long range, wreaking havoc. The gun was
well handled, and It is said was In charge of American gunners.
Many Mexicans on the Democrata were killed. Others jumped Into the river
and were drowned. The Democrata' was seriously disabled during the action
and quit the fight, floating down the stream.
After being repulsed the Mexican forces re-formed five miles away and re
newed the attack. The chances : of victory were in favor of the Yaquls, -when
the second division swept down from the north on the position occupied by the
â¢Indians. The Yaquis made a. brave stand for several hours, but seeing resistance
useless retreated up the river, taking their wounded. with them.
.Seventy-three dead warriors were found after. the Indians retreated. -

SEATTLE. Wash., Feb. 25.â Newspapers

prospecting was to be carried on this win
ter. Many miners have an idea that at

as the ice Is solidly frozen to the bottom
of the shore, they- were to begin pros
pecting and solve a much vexed question
as to the origin of the gold in the beach

with gold much in the same manner aa

Tundra prospecting, the advices say,

if it should prove rich, an area of coun

DR. HAYES SPEAKS OF THE
MURDER OF HIS WIFE
Evidence Adduced That Proves the
Crime Was Committed Owing
- to Caldwell's Infatuation.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â T0-day some
light Was thrown upon the murder of
Mrs. Maude Hayes by Dentist Franklin
L. Caldwell, when Dr. Hayes consented to
speak concerning the tragedy. Dr. Haye3
at first refused to discuss the case, but
when he felt his silence might be taken as
a reflection upon his wife's memory, he
made the following statement:
"1 never had tne least suspicion that
anything was wrong between my wife
and Dr. Caldwell, and I still believe that
the only thing wrong was his insane in
fatuation for her. I, have learned, how
ever, that he persuaded her to take drugs
that, had undermined her mental and
physical strength. 1 decided that some
thing ihad to be done, and knew that af
fairs had reached a crisis when the bot
tle of morphine was delivered last night.
â¢I am now sure that a more noble woman
than my wife never lived.
"For two weeks I have been observing
a change in my- wife. - Following my re
turn from Chicago two weeks ago last
Thursday. I saw that' she was greatly
changed, at times seeming to be only
semi-conscious. I believed her to be un
der the influence of drugs, and, in this I
was corroborated by a physician whom
1 called in. We had arranged to send her
away to-day."
Three letters were found to-day In the
Hayes apartments, two of them written
from Chicago by Mrs. Hayes to Dr. Cald
well. They contain only the most ordi
nary expressions of friendship. The third
letter, which was found in Mrs. Huyes'
desk, was undated and unsigned but had
been written by Dr. Caldwell. It was as
follows:

Mrs. Grace Allison who took the stand In
Judge de Haven's court two years ago
and told the tale of man's weakness and
woman's wiles which led to her incarcera
tion. . "
Grace Allison, as she is entered on the
prison books, Ida Qulnn, Smith and Col
lins, as she; called herself at; different
times of her viirit'd and adventurous ca
reer, was sent to the penitentiary in com
pany with Isaac Bain, her manager, be
cause Dr. Andrew Alexander Allison, who
hailed from Temple, Tex., loved the fair
widow not wisely but too well. .-..,..
Bain and the Allison woman had a par
tiality for "living easy," and Dr. 'Allison
offered himself as a means to that end.
Bain conducted a matrimonial paper and
Mrs. Allison figured in its columns as
"Mrs. Grace Collins, young and domes
tic." with the added attraction of possess
inK $35,000 and a desire to spend it on "a
middlo-aged man of prepossessing appear
ance." Bain's bait was taken by Dr. Alli
son, and in March. IMS. the doctor met
his namesake. Time passed away and the
ardent medico and his inamorata had set
the day for the union.
In April Allison returned to Temple, but
in his case out of sight was not out of
mind, for the malls between Temple and
San Francisco dally conveyed packages
to the latter place, all addressed to Mrs.
Collins. Nor. when the fountain showed
signs of drying was the wiuow coy of re
minding Allison that a new silk, dress
would prove acceptable, or that diamonds
and sealskins formed an. elegant and
fashionable combination. After about
$2000 had been expended In this way, the
doctor "smelled.a rat." He returned to
San Francisco and discovered the decep
tion which had been practiced on him.
Mrs. Allison and her partner were ar
rested and their sojourn in San Quentin
was the result. .

MUSICAL EVENT OF
IMPORTANCE IS PROMISED
The coming of Walter Damrosch, Mme.
Gadskh and Mr. Blspham in Wagnerian
recitals is an event of extraordinary im
portance. These artists are pre-eminent
as interpreters of the great German com
poser, and may be expected to afford the
tnu.Â«ic-loving public with authoritative
renderings of the more important music
of the great master.
Mr. Damrosch will give six "explana
tory recitals" with piano in the forenoon
nt Sherman, Clay & Co.'s Hall, beginning
March 5, and at the California Theater a
series of six concerts will be given, in
which Mme. Gadskl and Mr. . Bispham
will be heard.
The first of these will take place Tues
day afternoon, March 6. at 2:15 o'clock.
Each concert will be devoted to one of
the Waimerian operas, the first being
"Tannhauser." Mr. Damrosch'n recitals,
which promise great interest, will cover
the "Mbelungen Tetralogy," "Parsifal"
and "Tristan and Isolde." This > engage
ment is important to San Francisco,
chiefly because it will afford as an op
portunity to hear at least the vocal ele
ment of the Wagner operas Interpreted
to the best advantage.
Holmes Symphony Concert.
The fourth and next to the last of the
series of symphony concerts under the
direction of Henry Holmes will take place
at the Grand Opera House next Thursday
afternoon at 3:15. The programme will

VERY FEW PEOPLE
Are Fre- From Some Form of Indi-
gestion.
Very f*w people are free from some
firm of indigestion, but scarcely two will
bare the same symptoms.
Sew suffer most directly after eating.
Moating from pas in stomach and bowels,
others have heartburn or sour risings,
Ftill others have palpitation of heart,
hradaches. sleeplessness, pains in chest
and under shoulder blades, pome have ex-
trrme nervousness as In nervous dyspep-
eia.
But whatever the symptoms may be,
the caure in all cases of indigestion is the;
fame: that is. the stomach for som<s rea-
son fails to properly and promptly digest
what is eaten.
This i* the whole story of stomach trou-
bles in a nutshell. The stomach must have
rest and BLB&BtBXteG and Stuart's Dyspep-
f!,i Tablet? prive it both by supplying
those natural digestive? which every weak
ptomach lacks, owir.jr to the failure of the
peptic gland? in the stomach to secrete
efficient acid and pepsin to thoroughly
digest ard assimilate the food eaten.
One grain of the active principle in
Stuart's Dy?peps!a Tablets will digest
COGO grains of meat; egg* or other whole-
Fome food, and this claim has b^en proven
hy actual experiment which any one can
perform for hims<Mf in the following man-
ner: Cut a hard boiled eRg into very
FraaM piece?, as it would be if masticated,
place the cpj? and two or three of the
tablet* in a bottle or jar containing warm
water heated to 98 decrees (the tempera-,
ture of the- body) and keep it at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours, at
the end of which time the eRB will be as
completely digested as it would have been
in the healthy stomach of a hungry boy.
The pcint of tills experiment is that
T.hat Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do
tÂ» the egg in the bottle it will do to the
rjrc or meat In the stomach, and nothing
f>\*e will rest and invigorate the stomach
en safely and effectually. Even a little
rhild can take Stuart's Tablets with safety
end benefit if its digestion is weak and
the thousands of cure^ accomplished by
their regular daily use are easily ex-
plained when It is understood that they
are composed of vegetable essences, asep-
tic pepsin, diastase and Golden Seal,
which ming'e with the food and digest it
thoroughly, giving the overworked stom-
ech a cha:iee to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neither
do pills and cathartic medicines, which
Fimr'iy Irritate and lnfl-ime the intestines.
When enough food is eaten and prompt-
Jv digested there will be no constipation,
nor in fact will there be disease of any
kind, because good digestion means good
h<alth in every organ. 'Â¦

Blaze in the Mission.
The department was called out immedi

in the Mission at the residence of George
Parisen, 3353 Twenty-second street. At
the time of the fire the family was absent
and no information could be obtained as
to the cause. The contents of the two

by the time the department arrived. It
required thirty minutes to extinguish the
conflagration. There was no insurance

BRAVE FIREMAN EUGENE GROW RESCUES TWO
WOMEN FROM DEATH IN A BURNING BUILDING
Thieves Said to Be Responsible
for a Blaze That Partially Con
sumes Hotel El Monte.
Guests Become Panic Stricken, and Are
Only Prevented From Jumping From the
Upper Story Windows by the Heroic Work
of the Firemen.
THE moFt thrilling fire witnessed in
this city since the destruction of the
Baldwin Hotel occurred In the El
Monte Hotel, a boarding house at
&1 Geary street, 'oarly last evening.
In thÂ»Â» early stages of the conflagra
tion exciting spectacles of hairbreadth es
capes and daring rescues gTeeted the eyes
of a large throng gathered in the street,
nr.d inside of the burning building pan
demonium reipned. The supposed origin
of the fire adds a sensational feature, it
bring reported that robbers, while ran
raoking- the rooms in search of valuables.
<-nrelesFly dropped a match which Ignited
fome clothes In a closet in one of the
epartments.
The most stirring detail of the fire was
the rescue of Mrs. J. Lamont Greeg from
the fourth story of the hotel by Foreman
Crow of Truck I. The woman was pre
paring to leap to death below when the
brave fireman, cheered by thousands of
voices, sprang up a ladder, caught her In
his arms and carried her down to the
pavement. Crow then returned to the
floors where guests were Imprisoned and
carried another woman who remained
alone and bewildered in the third story,
down the stairway into the street.
The Alarm of Fire.
Phortly after 7 o'clock last evening a
number of the guests of the hotel left
their rooms and repaired to the dining
rooms. Among them was Mrs. J. J.
O'Connor, an artist, who occupied rooms
Sf>. SI. 32 and 33 of the building. The guests
had been seated at the table but a short
time when fire was discovered in the third
Ftorj*. Smoke issued in dense clouds from
room Sf>. and when the door was forced
open flames broke out and quickly spread
to the adjoining apartments. A cry of
Sre was raised and an alarm was turned
in from box 42 by Police Officer George
Collins. In the meantime the guests had
rushed to their rooms in an effort to save
Â«hai Â«hey could. Those on the fourth
floe* found themsflvos enveloped by
Fmoki" in an incredibly short time and
pandemonium reigned.

those who did not loose their heads set
to the work of rescue.

beat a hasty re-treat. A number of
iromfa rushed to windows and prepared
to jump, but they were restrained and
were assisted to escape. On the lower
floors and where the smoke was not so
thick trunks were pulled out of rooms,
and furniture was hurriedly removed. The
hotel records wore all removed, and valu
ables that had been deposited in the of
fice were taken away.
Fire Department Arrives.
When the Fire Department arrived it
appeared as if the building, which is of
four stories and a basement, was doomed
to destruction, and that another Baldwin
Hotel tire was imminent. Flames leaped
out of the windows on the third story
and the structure itself was wrapped in
smoke. A large crowd of people had
gathered an the scene and they heard,
with horror, women at the upper windows
calling for assistance. The firemen of
Truck 1 acted quickly. Ladders were
taken from the truck and the task of
saving life began. By the time the lad
ders had been placed in position, however,
most of the figures had disappeared from
view, and there remained but two women
who required help.
One of these was Miss McFarland, who
occupied a room on the fourth floor., and
was confined to her bed when the alarm
of fire was sounded. Willing hands, not
waiting for the firemen, saved her life,
and the fire tighten* stretched their ap
paratus to the window at which Mr 9. J.
Lemnnt Grees stood. Before the ladders
could reach her she had climbed from the
sill on to the flre escape and was prepar
ing to leap to the pavement below. Wil
liam Holland, an employe of a livery
stable, followed her through the room,
and seizing- her clothing, held her back.
Foreman Crow sprang up the ladder and
caught the woman in his arms just as she
had one foot over the fire escape guard.
Daring Rescue of Two "Women.
The daring fireman on the top of the
swaying ladder then grasped the woman
in his left arm and started downward.
Below the crowd cheered him to the
echo. When he took his charge at the
window, a mighty shout went up, and it
lasted until he had reached the ground in
safety and placed the woman in the arms
of her friends. Crow, heedless of the ova
tion he had received for his bravery,
climbed the ladder asain and entered the
burning building. Near the landing of
the third floor he found a woman who had
been left alone and unable to escape, and
he carried her down the stairway into the
street. The firemen had by this time com
menced fighting the fire. After an hour's
work they had it under control, and the
building was saved.
How the fire started is a matter of con
jecture. The flames broke out near a
closet in Mr?. O'Connor's room, which
she had left but a few minutes before.

CALIFORNIAN
STILL FAST
ON THE ROCKS
Passengers Are Safe, but
Have Not Left the
Vessel.
WAS OUT OF HER COURSE
She Is Stanchly Built and Sea
faring Men Are of the Opinion
That She Can Bo
Floated.
PORTLAND. Me... Feb. 25.â The bier Al
lan Line steamship Californian. which left
her dock at midnight, went ashore on
Ram Island Ledge, just outside the'har
bor, a few minutes after her pilot left her
this morning. All the passengers are safe,
although still aboard. Most of the local
seafaring men are of the opinion that the
roc*kS have penetrated the bottom of the
vessel in several places, and they doubt
very much if she can K Â« saved. Ine ves
sel is valued at $3,000,000 and the cargo at
$300,000. There are six cabin, five interme
diate and ten steerage passenjeers. be
sides a crew of seventy-five men. The
cabin passengers Â»re: Mr. and Mrs. Pat
ton, Montreal; Mr. and Mrs. D. WiUon.
Toronto; Miss Bailey. Ottawa, and Mr.
Browell. Esquimau. B. C.
The Californian was in charge of Pilot
Edward L. Parsons, and at the time he
left her the wind was blowing hard from
the southeast and a heavy rain was fall
ing. Pilot Parsons left the ship on reach
ing the bell buoy off Cusyngs Island
Point after he gave the officer of the ship
the correct course tÂ»^ minutes later the
Californian was hard and fast aground on
Ram Island Ledge. This is a reef which
runs out from Ram Island, and the ship
had gone several points off her course
when she struck, "a ..is afternoon the life
saving boat from the Cape Elizabeth life
savers, seven miles away, launched a
boat and put off for the steamer. Intend
ing to transfer the passengers from the
steamer to the tug Piedmont. Some of
the women passengers desired to be
transferred, but on seeing the manner In
which the lifeboat pitched and rolled they
decided not to leave the ship.
The ship is lying under the lee of Ram
island on the ledee. and although the
waves are breaking with great force the
long ledge acts as a breakwater and pro
tects the ship. The wind is now blowing
strongly from the westward and the sea
is subsiding. â¢
The passengers will probably be taken
off to-morrow morning without danger,
and if the sea is smooth the work of re
moving the cargo will commence. The
local officials feel confident that thÂ© ship
can be floated. The conditions now are
favorable.
The Californian was bound to Glasgow
by way 6t Halifax. Captain Barclay says
that the hold Is full of water, the fires
are extinguished, there Is a heavy sea and
the passengers are perfectly safe. The
cargo of 3000 tons consists mainly of
meats, lard, apples, cheese and grain.
The greater part of the cargo was prob
ably insured by the consignees. It is not
known whether the ship was insured.
The steamship State of California, now
named the Californian, was built on the
Clyde and launched in 1591. She la built
of milled steel, is class Al in Lloyd's spe
cial survey and with additional strength
ening over Lloyd's requirements as well

SAVE THE SEQUOIAS.
rROM the efforts that are being made by so
many earnest and energetic people to save the
giant trees of Calaveras a reasonable hope is
afforded of their success. A resolute public opinion
directed to a worthy end rarely ever fails to accom
plish its purpose in the United States; and in this
case the object aimed at is one against which there
can be no possible antagonism. The only obstacle in
the way of those who seek to save the trees is the
inertia that has to be overcome. Even when the
Government is willing to do a certain thing, it is not
always easy to get it done, for the executive depart
ment waits on Congress and Congress waits on
everything.
The Call has pointed out a method by which the
trees may be saved through governmental aid with
out waiting for an appropriation to purchase the
grove; for if that be waited for the grove may be cut
away from the face of the earth before it comes.
Whether that plan or some other equally good be
adopted is, however, a detail of the subject. The one
vital point is to save the trees, and in any well-directed
plan to that end there should be, and doubtless will
be, general and cordial co-operation.
The grove is one of the most interesting natural
features of this continent, and even of the world. It
is one of the wonders of nature, and to destroy it
would be an offense hardly less gross than that com
mitted by the vandals of old in destroying the mighty
monuments and edifices that stood in Greece and
Italy to attest the architectural magnificence and
artistic beauty of the civilization of the ancients. A
new civilization has arisen which can replace the old
edifices with buildings hardly less stately and much
more commodious, but no civilization could by the
careful cultivation of a thousand years restore the
Calaveras grove to its present sublimity.
Fortunately the interest in the grove is widespread.
There are thousands of people in the East who will
be as eager as Californians themselves to save it from
the woodman's ax and saw. The co-operation of
these persons in the efforts to save the trees may be
confidently expected. Their influence will have
weight with Congressmen from the Eastern States,
and it is thus reasonable to hope they may be in
duced to act promptly enough to prevent the felling
of a single one of the great trees. Vlr, '
Meantime to the various clubs, associations and in
dividuals who are giving so much of their time and
their energy to save the grove, the thanks not only
of Californians, but of all Americans, are* due. They
are doing a work which will redound to their credit
through all future time; and if they succeed the big
trees will stand as monuments to their energy and
public spirit if not to their names.

Russia Is building six cruisers, ranging
between 6500 and 6630 tons and speeds
varying from 20 to 23 knots. Three of
these cruisers, the Diana. Aurora and
Pallada. are building at St. Petersburg
by contract, and are of the 20-knot type
and 6630 tons. The Waryag, building at
Cramps', Bogatyr, at Stettin, and AskoUl,
at Kiel, are of the 23-knot class and "6500
tons,, and the contract stipulations for
speed are identical, and will no doubt be
very interesting as to results, as three
separate yards will be put on their mettle
to drive their ships for twelve consecutive
hours at an average speed of 23 knots.
The Askold is further handicapped by a
limitation to a coal consumption of two
pounds, and the builders will be further
more subject to a fine of $20,000 for every
inch above an excess of six inches al
lowed.

power and 15.02 knots speed. The defects
In the sheathed cruiser Gulchen appears

a three-hour run under full power she de

The armored cruiser Fuerst Bismarck,
of 10.452 tons displacement, was laid down
in the dockyard at Kiel April 1, 1596. and
launched September 23. 1597. The estimat
ed cost Is: Ship and engines, $3,375,000; grun
armament, $750,000; torpedo armament,
$195,000; total, $4,320,000. The armor belt, 8
feet 2 Inches in height, extends all around
and is 7.87 inches thick in the maximum,
tapering to 3.94 inches at the ends, and the
several protective decks and armored
transverse bulkheads afford a very fair

A QUIET SEASON IN TRADE.
THE statistical showing of trade was less favor
able again last week. The failures through
out the country were 201, against 191 for the
same week last year, and the bank clearings showed a
: loss of 16 per cent. Of the largest cities in the coun
'..Â¦ try six â New York, Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis,
. I'ittsburg and Baltimore â showed a loss, while five â
Chicago, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Kansas City and
New Orleans â showed a gain. This weekly irregu
larity is again becoming pronounced, and indicates
an unsettled condition of trade. In fact, conditions
are mixed. The railway earnings are very large as
. compared with the fame time in 1899. but they were
Email last year, owing 'to inclement weather, while it
is well known that the railways are cutting rates.
The distributive trade of the country is fair, but some
of the important staples are declining. The steep
v prices of the past twelve months can no longer be
held up, because the top notch, so long expected, has
*Â¦ ?.t last been reached, and goods have got so high that
the demand is dropping off. In other words, there
is no longer any boom. But the cheapening of the
staples is resulting in more business here and there.
This is especially noticeable in the boot and shoe
trade, some manufacturers reporting increased con
tracts owing to the decline in hides and leather, which
. ere giving some shops work enough to keep them
4 going a little longer, though most of them report few
orders and some arc shutting down. Cancellations
of wool orders are bccoaiing numerous, and some
grades arc cheaper. The iron industry also shows
, less strength, and some markets report less business,
while others report more. Structural iron continues
r, active, indicating large building operations during
the coming spring and summer. The West reports
an increasing demand for hardware. The spring
trade in even-thing is reported enlarging rather than
diminishing.
Wall street continues tame and featureless. While
there is no pronounced bear sentiment, speculation is
apathetic and favorable conditions fail to attract the
; public. Money has been working rather firmer of
lateÂ» and this may tend to keep the market dull.
California is making as good a showing at the
moment as any other State, and better than some.
Thus far there has been no marked decrease in the
bank clearings of San Francisco, and indeed there
was a pronounced gain in January. The merchants
report business fully up to the average at this time of
f the year, collections are fair and failures are compara
tively few, and then not serious. Farm products,
however, are dull, and the tendency in most descrip
tions is toward a lower range of values. Wheat is
ftill in the dumps, and has been slowly declining for
some little time. The weakness and inactivity in this
governing cereal impart a soft tone to the minor
grains, and feedstuffs of all sorts are quiet and easy,
owing to the abundance of green grass. Continued
fine weather results in extensive farming operations,
and the acreage this year, bids fair to be vast. The
South is still complaining of dry weather, while the
northern and central portions of the State have had
rain to spare. The fruit men are regarding the fine
February weather with an apprehensive eye. for a
balmy February generally means a frosty March and
the destruction of more or less fruit.
These points cover the condition of business
throughout the State and country- In quiet times
there is little to be said. The volume of trade will
hardly reach the high figures of 1899, unless some
thing now invisible occurs to give commerce a re
newed stimulus; nor is there any sign that 1000 will
be an unfavorable year. .Briefly stated, the rush is
over, and we have settled down to normal conditions
again.

0N ANTI-TRUST SUGGESTION.
\A ANY have been the suggestions as to the best
/ \ means of preventing the admitted evils of
* â¢ trust organizations. Some reckless reformers
would sweep away the good of such combinations as
well as the evil by abolishing them altogether; but
such people, while they make a good deal of noise,
represent but a small- cla-ss of the population of the
country. In one form or another co-operation is
being practiced in almost all lines of industry, and, as
ir would be well nigh impossible to define the boun
dary between the organizations which tend JLo the
general welfare and those which are adverse, it Js clear
that anything like a wholesale condemnation of
trusts is not to be desired.
The very difficulty of distinguishing between the
good and the bad features of these combinations adds
interest to any intelligent and fair-minded suggestion
of an effectual method of dealing with them. Bourke
Cochran's recommendation that full publicity should
be given to all the business of trusts was of th.it
nature and received no inconsiderable approval from
earnest students of the subject. Another recently
made by James J. Hill is equally worthy of considera
tion, and in some respects is perhaps the best that
has yet been put forth.
Mr. Hill says: "The way to abolish trusts is to
make stockholders liable. If trusts when organized
were compelled to demonstrate to the legal authori
ties that every share of stock issued had been fully
paid up on a par basis, a very long step would be
taken in a remedial way. In addition thereto the
stockholders in every trust organization should be
made responsible for ultimate losses in double the
amount of the par value of their stock, precisely as
banking institutions are now organized. Thus it
would happen that every time a man of property put
out a share of stock from an organized trust he
would be liable not only for the money which he Tiad
already put in, but for as much more, in case any loss
was sustained by the public on account of this organi
zation."
If Congress have constitutional authority to enact
a law of that kind and should do so, there can be no
question that it would put a sudden stop to the for
mation of speculative trusts and the floating of stock
based upon a fictitious capital. Moreover, it would
put an end to the practice of issuing watered stock.
There would be very little chance of booming trust
stocks if the stockholders ' were made liable for
double the amount of the par value of the stock they
held. '}'&!>
Mr. Hill is himself president of one of the greatest
corporations in the country and has administered its
affairs with remarkable success. Few men under
stand better than himself the uses of large combina

ANOTHER NOVEL
IS DRAMATIZED
. "The Silence of Dean Maitland" just
misses being a loud melodrama. It was
presented yesterday afternoon at the Cal
ifornia Theater by H. R. Roberts and
company from Australia.
The craze for staging successful novels
has led to many dramatic catastrophes,
but to none mÂ»>re fatal than this. The
unfltness of Maxwell Gray's story for' the
stage was variously evident from the be
ginning of the play to its end and the
mechanic who adapted this very poor ma
terial to theatric purposes made a sorry
job of it indeed. It could not be made,
into a good play; but it might have been
made into a better one.
There is nothing vital in the cowardly
and long drawn-out remorse of Cyril
Maitlana. clergyman, seducer and mur
derer; yet after the single episode of the
murder, which occurs in the prologue,
there are four tedious actfuls of conse
quent incidents devoid Â¦of Interest and
with little or no dramatic value.
Regarded psychologically, there Is
never a telling touch in the treatment of
the character of Maitland. The problem
of this conscience-stricken man of God
without the fortitude to bear the respon
sibility of his crimes might be one of op
portunity if handled more concretely; as
it is, the purpose is defeated by the ex
cessive tenuity of the plot, and no actor
in the part of the contrite dean, be he
ever so skillful, could succeed in knitting
the loose ends of haphazard incident into
a fabric sufficiently compact to bear the
broidery of a convincing characterization.
Mr. Roberts certainly cannot do so, for
as an actor he Is most disappointing. He
Is handicapped by his looks and by his
voice, which is unequable and which he
uses badly. His emphasis is particularly
irrational. "What his resources may be
we have yet to learn, and as he will ap
pear later in the week in a broad Irish
farce, it is quite possible he will improve
on acquaintance. The capability of grad
uates from, English stock companies is
sometimes considerable, for they afford
the best training for an actor in the
world, but. if it be within Mr. Roberts'
ability to carry Shakespearean leads and
low comedy parts, it is a pity we should
be first introduced to him in a role that
does not suit him at all.
The other members of the company
either act very badly or do not act at all;
usually the latter, and the stress of emo
tion which should be brought on by some
of the anguishing scenes concern them so
little that they neither express nor con
vey.
There is a single exception to the uni
form mediocrity of the company, and that
is one of promise rather than of fact. Mr.
Wi J. Townshend as Charlie Judkins, in
the prologue, showed some real ability
which not only needs cultivation, but war
rants it. PORTER GARNETT.
Denman Thompson will appear in his
original role of Uncle Josh in "The Old
Homestead" at the Columbia this even

strong: attraction.
On Wednesday night the bill at the Cali
fornia will be changed from "The Silence
of Dean Maitland" to "Mrs. Quinn's

her appearance. She will be supported in
this comedy by her Australian company,
including Mr. H. R. Roberts.

THE REGULATION OF TELEPHONES.
AT the meeting of the Board of Supervisors to
day steps will probably be taken to provide for
such supervision and regulation of telephone
corporations as public welfare requires. To accom
plish that it will be necessary to amend the charter,
and it is to that end the action of to-day is expected
to be taken.
Supervisor McCarthy, whose ordinance imposing a
license tax upon telephones promises to prove an
efficient measure, gave notice some time ago that he
would move for an election upon the charter amend
ment, and the time has come when the motion should
be made. Any delay would be to the advantage of
the corporations. The issue is now fresh in the pub
lii- mind, .and popular interest in it has been stimu
lated by the boast of an official of the Pacific Tele
phone Company that if a tax be laid upon the cor
poration in this city it will "put it in the bill." If the
measure be delayed there is a danger that the excite
ments of the coming Presidential campaign may dis
tract the attention of the voters from their local in
terests, and the corporation will profit by it.
It is to be remembered that after the proposed
amendment has been voted for by the people it will
have to be submitted to "the Legislature and ratified by
that body before it becomes a part of the charter.
There is to be a meeting of the Legislature next win
ter, and if the amendment be adopted by the citizens
this year the Legislature can take action upon it at that
time. If there should be delay, however, in holding
the election, the matter would have to go over for.
two years, or until the legislative session of 1002.
Clearly, therefore, the Supervisors should give the
subject prompt consideration and urge action upon
it as rapidly as possible.
It is to be borne in mind that in the proposed
amendment there is designed nothing of injustice to
the telephone corporations. The object of it is sim
pl3 r to put such corporations on a level so far as
municipal law is concerned, with all others controll
ing public utilities. When the new charter was
under consideration the astute attorney for the tele
phone corporation managed to have the charter so
drawn that it gave the Supervisors no power to regu
late such corporations. The trick is clever, but not
commendable. It will not profit the telephone cor>
porations anything, but it will put the municipality
to the expense of an election to amend the defect,
and in that fact the corporation and its attorney may
find something of satisfaction. Were it possible in
practical affairs to do "poetic justice," it would be
proper in this instance for the people to compel the
corporation to pay the whole cost of the election
which it has rendered necessary; and the corporation
in turn would be justified in exacting the amount from
the attorney whose excessive astuteness got it into
the scrape.
BURIAL WITHIN THE CITY.
SINCE at a joint meeting of the Judiciary, Hos :
pital and Health Committees of the Board of
Supervisors a majority agreed to recommend
the passage of an ordinance prohibiting burials within
the limits of the city, after August i, 1901, that long;
debated issue will once more come before the munici
pal authorities for action.
It has been evident to all intelligent observers of
the development of the city that sooner or later the
use of the old-time cemeteries as places of burial must
cease. At the time those tracts were set aside for the
repose of the dead they were remote from the habi
tations of the living, and there was then no objection
to that use of them. In the growth of the city, how
ever, the population has moved westward as well as
southward, and the cemeteries are now within one of
the best of our residence districts. We cannot put. a
stop to the increase of population nor to the building
of new homes in those parts of the city, and conse
quently there must be an end to further burials in the
cemeteries there.
The issue is not peculiar to San Francisco. Every
growing city or town in America and in Europe has
had to deal with it. Modern sanitary science has
disclosed the fact that the burial of the dead within
the limits of cities is a fruitful source of disease; and
is moreover objectionable in many other ways. Gov
ernments enlightened by science have therefore put a
stop to the old-time practice, and cemetery after
cemetery within city limits has been closed. In
some instances the new ordinances have put a stop
to the custom of almost immemorial antiquity, but
in even- instance the results have been beneficial, and
after the first feeling of antagonism was over, even
the opponents of the reform have conceded the wis
dom of it.
The issue has been brought about in San Francisco
more quickly than in other communities owing to
the rapid growth of the city, and for that reason it
appears to some to be premature. It is hardly a gen
eration ago since the cemeteries were established,
and some of the more conservative of our people can
not be persuaded that it is necessary to so soon close
them. Among those, however, who live in the dis
tricts, and are familiar with all the conditions, there
are no doubts on the subject. The cemeteries block
the westward growth of the city and the dead are in
the way of the living. It is not right nor wise that
it should be so. Sooner or later we must do what has
been done elsewhere in this regard and put a stop to
city burials; and it is certainly expedient that we
should do so as soon as possible.
The proposed ordinance does not undertake hasty
or inconsiderate action. It is not to go into effect
for more than a year from this time â in fact not for
eighteen months â and that allows an ample period for
arrangements to be made for burials in the suburban
cemeteries.
It is to be borne in mind there is nothing in the
proposed measure that even by implication carries any
disrespect for the dead, or can wound the tenderest
sentiments of the living whose dead are resting
within the city. The measure is based indeed upon
the teachings of science and the reasons for it appeal
to the intellect, but there is nothing in it to offend
the heart or hurt the sensibilities of the spirit. It is a
judicious measure well devised for the general good.
It must be adopted in the end, and it would be best
to have it adopted now.
problem of trust restriction to be beyond practical
solution. Such suggestions as that of Mr. Hill." how
ever, give encouragement to the hope that we may
yet put a check upon the evils without preventing
the accomplishment of the economic benefits of
trusts.

Ing to this proposition. Mr. Plnckney. onÂ«
of the Commissioners, exclaimed indig
nantly, "Millions for defense; not one cent
for tribute." The X. Y. Z. dispatches (so
called because those letters were substi
tuted for the names of the unworthy
French agents) relating the insulting Inci
dent having been laid before Congress,
were published, and the nation went wild
with Indignation. "Washington was com
mander in chief of the army, and prepara
tions for war with France were eagerly
set on foot. The widespread approval of
the attitude of the administration carried
the Federal party to its highest pitch of
popularity. The fortunes of the Republi
can party bade fair to be utterly over
whelmed. All classes clamored tor wip
ing out in blood the indignity which had
been put upon the nation. "Millions for
defense; not one cent for tribute!" runjr
through the length and breadth of tha
land. For nearly a year war upon tha
seas actually existed, but no formal dec
laration of war was made by either party
to the quarrel. There can be little doubt
that but for the coolness and good judg
ment cf the President the two peoples
would have speedily become involved in
serious and bloody strife. But Mr. Adams
met with ready cordiality the first sign
of the rise of a conciliatory temper on the
part of the offending power. A new Min
ister and Commissioners were sent over
to adjust matters. They found Napoleon
as First Consul at the head of the Govern
ment, the Directory superseded and those
in power ready for an amicable settle
ment. President Adams assumed the re
sponsibility cf concluding a treaty of
peace. But to the excited, warlike tem
per of his countrymen this wisdom ami
moderation seemed weaknt-ss and pusil
lanimity and were made the ground of
renewed opposition to the Federal party.
The Federalists who favored the war
were also offended. The President stead

Causes of the Decline of tho Federal-
ist Party.
Tho fall of the Federal party from
power now became Inevitable. Various
causes contributed, alon? with the di
verse views as to foreign affairs, to ac
celerate its downfall. There were dissen
sions and jealousies within the party,
and Cabinet counsels were divided. SorriÂ«
of the President's personal qualities of
fended and repelled those who might
have been his friends. His temper was
cold and somewhat suspicious, and ho
was thought to have an overweening
sense of his own official dignity and im
portance. Especially were the principal
acts of the administration calculated to
discredit the party. A stamp act impos
ing a duty upon stamped paper and vel
lum; a naturalization bill requiring four
teen, yeara' residence instead of five; an
act increasing army and navy: certain
direct taxes and public loansâ all these
were odious to the people-. But above
all did the alien and sedition acts of 170?
arouse an Indignant and powerful popu
lar opposition.
The alien act authorized the President
to remove from the country "such aliens
born, not entitled by the constitution and,
laws to the rights of citizenship, as may
be dangerous to Its peace and safety." In
spite of the resistance of influential
statesmen, headed by Albert Gallatln. to
this drastic and uncalled-for measure. thÂ«
bill was passed, limited in its operation
to two years. Though It was never en
forced. It still- worked its disintegrating
effects upon the party originating it.
The sedition act was even more obnox
ious. It made it a crime punishable with
fine and Imprisonment for persons to com
bine to oppose measures of the Govern-

ment, to intimidate any officeholder, to
publish libels upon the Government or tha
President or the houses of Congress, or
to excite against them any unlawful op
position, etc. The main object of this act
was understood to be to suppress the Re
publican Journals and silence their lead
ing writers. By it the Federal Govern
ment instead of the individual States^ â
each within Its own boundaries â was mada
the regulator of the press. The bill wa3
carried against the opposition of tha
ablest of the Federal leaders of the day.
Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall.
The force of the sedition act was to ex
pire in ISOI. and it was at once put into
operation. That it should actually be en
forced, that the press should be muzzled
and free speech denied, aroused such bit
ter animosity toward the party promul
sating such tyrannical, such iniquitous
measures as alone insured its speedy re
moval from power. Even more serious
results seemed to threaten. Many of tho
Republicans believed the Federalists to
be using the power of the National Gov
ernment to destroy the sacred rights of
the people, and the question of the with
drawal of certain States from the Union
was actually discussed. Jefferson, how
ever, believed that a remedy lay rather
in an appeal to the people through the
State Legislatures. Two such assemblies
âthe Legislatures of Kentucky and Vir
giniaâintroduced resolutions setting forth
the view that the constitution was a com
pact to which the States were parties, and
that "each party has an equal right to
judge for Itself as well of Infractions as
of thÂ© mode and measures of redress."
The dangerous statutes passed by tha
Federalists were declared by thÂ© Ken
tucky resolutions â which were drawn bjr
Jefferson himself â "void and of no effect,
while the other States were urgred to>
unite in presenting a protest to Congress.
A second series of resolutions passed by
the Kentucky Lepislaturc In 1733 went
further and declared "nullification â¢ â¢ â¢
the rightful remedy."
An important constitutional doctrlno
wan set forth in these Virginia and Ken
tucky resolutions, but they were particu
larly designed to direct attention to tha
alarming of Federalist legislation
and to influence the approaching: Presi
dential election. That election now drew
on. The coolness between Adams and
Hamilton had become hatred, and, in
volving their supporters, led to an open
breach which divided the Federal party
into two Irreconcilable factions. The Re
publicans were united in their hostility
to the home policy of the party in power,
and they possessed In Aaron Burr one or
the most astute as well as the most un
scrupulous of political schemers. Burr
had made himself in New York (already
a "pivotal" State) the leader of the popu
lar forces as against the aristocratic and
family interests which had hitherto domi
nated the State. His skillful manipula
tion of the spring elections resulted in
the choice of a Republican majority for
the State Legislature, which would choosa
Presidential electors In the autumn.

CANAL TREATY
IS CERTAIN TO

Its Advocates Already Have
Almost a Two-Thirds
Majority.
Special ' Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. "WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â
The Hay-Pauncefote treaty will be rati
fied. There's no doubt about that. A can
vass of the Senate shows that the advo
cates of the treaty fall only three or four
votes short of the required two thirds,
and President McKinley may be trusted
to win over as many as are needed to
give effect to the treaty.
If the treaty, providing: as It does for
an unfortified neutral canal, can be rati
fied, it follows that the Senate will modify
the canal bill now before It so as to con
form in this respect. But advocates of an
"exclusively American canal" in tho Sen
ate will cause delay. Meanwhile .the
House will assuredly pass the bill as it
stands, providing for fortifications, and
therefore an appointment of conferees
will be necessary, and the present temper
of the House indicates that it wllljclintf
very tenaciously to the Idea of erecting
fortifications on the waterway.
Before the bill can come up for consid
eration at all, however, there will be ure
liminary delay. It has ben reported by
committees of both houses, and Repre
sentative Hepburn, who has charge of it
in the lower house, has asked the Com
mittee on Rules to fix a date. This com
mittee is favorable to the bill, but will
not take any action until the Porto Rlcan
measure is disposed of, which experienced
observers think will be in about two
weeks. The House, it is conceded, will
pass the bill as it stands, regardless of
the treaty. Meanwhile the Senate Is oc
cupied with the Hawaiian discussion. This
should terminate to-morrow, but Senator
Morgan will not attempt to force the
canal matter to the front until after the
bill for the government of Porto Rico,
reported by Senator Foraker's committee,
shall be disposed of. The intensity of
feeling on this auestion and tne traditions
of Senatorial debate make it certain that
this will be a protracted discussion.

I.âTHE FEDERALIST PARTY.
(Continued.)
International Relations.
Foreign affairs were prominent In party
controversy from the first year of Wash
ington's first term of office, which was
also' the flrst year of the French revolu
tion. In the course of a few years nearly
all Europe had been drawn Into the con
flict. England and France were at war.
The revolutionists, influenced as they had
been by the successful example of the
United States in resistance to tyranny,
looked to us for sympathy and support
in their own struggle. Jefferson and many
of the Republicans were inclined to con
cede the rightfulness of the claim, in spite
of the horrible excessas which marked the
progress of the revolution. The federal
ists, as the party of law and order, and
the representatives of established govern
ment,'gave their sympathies to England,
and deprecated the lawlessness and vio
lence perpetrated in France In the name
of liberty.* 'Washington and his Cabinet,
which included Jefferson, agreed In the
expediency of the neutrality proclamation
issued in 1793. There was still a strong
feeling throughout the country in favor
of France. Party spirit ran high, and
much bitter feeling was generated. The
party in power seemed on the point of
precipitating war with France, while the
Republicans advocated measures which
would have been certain to' embroil us
with England. Secret organizations called
Democratic societies, modeled after the
Jacobin clubs of Paris, were formed by
members of the Republican party, and
coincident with their rise a new French
Minister, "Citizen Genet,", arrived in the
United States. Instead of proceeding to
Philadelphia to present his credentials,
Genet landed in Charleston, S. C. and,
not doubting that the American people
were in full sympathy with the new Gov
ernment In France, at once busied himself
with enlisting men and commissioning
privateers.
Ships were captured In American waters
and brought Into American ports for con
demnation. The young French Minister
carried himself as If America were only
outlying French territory, and his Amer
ican sympathizers responded with aston
ishing enthusiasm. The Democratic clubs
multiplied rapidly, and Genet advanced
toward the capital attended by the lauda
tions of admiring multitudes. Arrived at
Philadelphia, he encountered a different
spirit. The moderation and firmness of
Washington and his Cabinet, the recent
proclamation of neutrality and the whole
temper of the Federal party proved Insur
mountable obstacles to the continuance of
the career upon which he had entered In
so unseemly and undiplomatic a manner.
Unable to Influence the administration, he
persisted, in spite of the remonstrances of
our Government, in fitting out and send
ing to sea still another privateer, and he
determined to make a public appeal to the
citizens of the United States to disown
and override the acts of their President.
Our Government could not but ask for his
recall, and happily it was granted. Genet's
brief term of service worked, after all.
disaster to his cause. A reaction set In;
the excitement having cooled, the people
resented the Insult to their national Gov
ernment, and the leaders of opinion
showed that they were deeply offended.
A marked change in the drift of sentiment
appeared, away from France and toward
England. The Democratic societies grad
ually lost both popularity and Influence,
and the fall of Robespierre in Paris in
1704 accelerated their decline.
The Whisky. Rebellion.
The societies had in the meantime lent
their aid In support of the rebellious re
sistance In Southwestern Pennsylvania to
the excise act of 1791. This is known in
history as the "Whisky Rebellion," ard
was a violent opposition to the enforce
ment of the revenue laws. It was forci
bly-suppressed by the militia of several
neighboring States called out by the Pres
ident. The outcome made It apparent to
all that the new National Government
had both the determination and the mili
tary power to put down any Insurrection
likely to arise, while Washington's criti
cism In his message upon the episode, of
certain "self-created" societies as having
"disseminated suspicions, -jealousies and
accusations of the whole Government,"
still further discredited the Democratic
clubs, already losing their hold upon the
people. They steadily continued to de
cline and soon died out. *
Administration of John Adams.
At this juncture the firm hand and wise
head of Washington were withdrawn from
the conduct of our national tUTalrs. He
declined absolutely to be for a third time
a candidate for the Presidency, and In
1796 a hotly contested election resulted In
the choice of John Adams, Federalist,
over Thomas Jefferson, Republican. Ac
cording to a constitutional provision then
in force but since altered, Jefferson, hav
ing, after Adams, received the largest
number of electoral votes, became Vice
President.
c The new President, having been elected
by a small majority, came into power un
der unfavorable conditions. His first act
was to call a special session of Congress
to consider our relations with France.
The country was in an excited state.
Great Britain had pursued a course most
exasperating to the. Americans. She had
failed to fulfill the provisions of the treaty
of 1783; she was believed to have secretly
aided hostile Indians; she had seized
American ships and Impressed American
seamen Into the British service. It would
have been easy . to- plunge the two na
tions Into renewed conflict. The Federal
ists had been prevented by the opposi
tion from equipping a navy adequate to
the protection of our commerce, and a
palliative policy seemed the only possi
ble one in view of the weakness of the
infant nation. Washington's special en
voy, John Jay, had succeeded In 1795 In
arranging a treaty not, indeed, entirely
satisfactory to his own people, but which
under the Influence of the President'!*
calm, convincing persuasion was accepted
in place of the only other- alternative
war. But It had made the Federal party
unpopular. Hamilton was stoned upon
the street and Washington himself waa
treated with shameful abuse.
During the whole of the administration
of President Adams, the question of our
relations with France - actively engaged
the attention of the country. As a re
sult of French resentment of the Jay
treaty diplomatic intercourse with the
United States was suspended and various
unfriendly acts perpetrated. American
envoys sent to Paris for conference with
the French Government were even ap*
proached by secret emissaries of Prince
Talleyrand, who offered to put an end to
outrages upon American ships and to set
tle all matters In dispute on the payment
of a large sum of money to certain mem
bers of the French Government. Reply-
THE biggest new thing in the Cali
fornia mining field is the scheme of
the California Debris Commission
for impounding debris In the Yuba
River at a cost of 5500.000.
It is a n^>vel scheme, interesting
In its every phase. It- has been waited
for. since lS93.*and $500,000 of State and
Federal money has been available for it
since 1596. This first solution of the big
old problem of keeping the wash of the
mountains back in the hills where it be
longs has not been hastily jumped at. It
has ' been worked out of a tremendous
amount of sttidy, hole-digging 6and
thought. It has been supposed for some
years that there -wore to be big and high
rock dams to h6ld in check the debris
still working dovnward and people have
been quite sure that one would be built at
either Daguerre Point or the Narrows on
the Yuba above Marysville. Long inves
tigation showed these to be too costly and
difficult to be practicable, and so the
"project of 1593" has been conceived and
worked out and been approved by Chief
of Engineers Wilson.
"The project as submitted Is novel, since
nothing of the kind, so far as known, has
ever been attempted," say the Federal en
gineers In their report.
And it is new. Rivers have been
dammed, changed and otherwise regulat
ed in all manner of ways and the engi
neering world is rich in data and experi
ence of this order, but it has been the
water that has been considered before.
The problem and method of governing
vast quantities of eroded detritus in tor
rential streams has no precedents. About
the only former attempt in this line was
on the headwaters of the Rhine, where
denudation and soil cultivation made sim
ilar trouble lor Swiss and Austrian peas
ants.
So the Yuba presented an original prob
lem, and it has been worked out, mainly
by Assistant Engineer Hubert Vischer, In
an original way. The Yuba is a remark
able mountain stream "and deserves origi
nal treatment. It is like the other tor
rential streams of the * Sierra Nevadas,
only more su. It drains a large area of
eteep slopes and high' snow fields and it
dances down an exceptionally steep
grade, through deep gorges it has dug. In
its flood times it is a buolime torrent. In
narrow canyons it pours its waters fifty
to eighty feet deep, the rushing flood pil
ing several feet higher In the center and
tossing pine trees like straws. If its vol
umo then and the average altitude of,
say, SuOO feet, from which its waters fall,
be taken, it will be found almost to gen
erate the power of Niagara Falls. Its ra
diating headwaters drain Nevada and
Sierra counties, and there is in its water
shed an auriferous gravel which the hy
draulic miners of the past sluiced away
on such a stupendous scale. These tail
ings the Yuba gathered and rushed down
the slope witn its floods, and so it came
that "the Yuba carried to the valley more
detritus than all the other tributaries of
the Sacramento combined.
When it gets to the Narrows, some
thirty miles a^oye and east of Marysville,
it reaches the foothill region and slows
up to flow more circumspectly through
Its fruitful valley and nankins hills, in
this foothill stretch it laid down most of
Its burden of coarse material and sprad
dled out all over it. In burying its own
bed it climbed up here ten and there fifty
feet. It went on to the more level valley
with great quantities of fine sediment, or
"slickens." ana it gently laid it wherever
it could. Its raised bed kept workinj: on
to Marysville and the Feather. Mhey
built hign levees for miles to keep it with
in bounds, and between these levees,
which are in places three miles apart, it
wanders constantly, changing its channel
frequently. From the Narrows to Marys
ville is a big waste of gravel through
which the river wanders, out much of it
Is overgrown with wllldws and other veg
etation which is gradually making rich
soil out of the slicKens covered alluvium.
The engineering problem and purpose
is to stay forever where they are tne oulk
of the debris through which the river
flows below tho Narrows, to arrest in
Its course all new material brought down,
including the fine sediment, and to assist
the Yuba to make a new and permanent
channel and allow the flanking wastes to
be reclaimed. The miners want dams be
hind which they may resume mining, but
this is left to the future and is not con
templated in the present restraining
scheme.
The coarse material is to be held by
long and comparatively low dams at dif
ferent points and the plans for them are
interesting from an engineering view. The
most novel .feature Is that, to take the
fine sediment out of the water. There is
to be a settling basin three miles long
into which the river will all flow at or
dinary stages. If the water poured out
in a stream at the lower end the currents
would "'â¢event much settling. So Mr.
Vischer has devised a scheme to make the
water percolate through eight pyramidal
structures of logs, planks, cement and
cracks. The water will flow through a
great number of half-inch or less slits
from all sides of the pyramids, which
have 70-foot bases and are strung across
the basin. The flow can be regulated and
currents are avoided. This basin is cal
culated to hold 14,000,000 cubic yards of
fine sediment. The basin can be enlarged
to hold 50,000,000 cubic yards more. The
Yuba will be clean when it gets to Marys
ville.' Watera have been cleaned before,
but it has always been on account of the
water.' So this torrential mountain
stream, which has always had Its own
rapid and wayward way, will have to ac
tually stop and leak out Into the Sacra
mento Valley.
The plan Includes parallel leveelike
structures below, which will confine the
stream and help it dig a straight and reg
ular course clear to the Feather. The
scheme Is also a huge concentrator, which
separates coarse and fine material and
automatically cares for each.
The report of the commission outlines
the plan and is accompanied by many
maps and drawings and a detailed report
by Mr. Vischer containing 30,000 words.
It will soon be published. After review
ing the earlier projects for masonry dams
the report says:
"The latter project has for Its primary
object the storage of mining debris within
the bed of the Yuba River by a system
of works designed to separate the coarse
material from the fine; and for a second
ary object the controlling of the low
water channel within narrower and well
defined limits In order to preserve In place
the extensive deposits In the river below,
the general scheme being to erect several
barriers across the bed of thf river, the
upper ones to be -located about three
miles east of the mouth of Dry Creek,
known as barriers No. 1 and No. 2 re
spectively: another to be situated just be
low the mouth of Dry Creek, marked on
the 'map as a 1 flood overflow barrier; an
other to be placed at Daguerre Point, In
dicated as the Daguerre barrier; also to
form a settling basin about three miles
in length and one-half mile in width on
the. south side of the river, this settling
basin to consist of a levee protected
against wash, to be built in the bed of the
river, with its upper and lower ends con
necting with the existing levee and shore
ctii the south bank, these end walls to
have inlet and outlet weirs and conauits
to regulate the Inflow and outflow of river
waters and to cause the finer material
carried in suspension to be deposited and
held in the settling basin, through which
at all except extreme flood stages the
river will be compelled to flow, and below
this basin to confine -the river channel
within well defined lines by necessary
training works." - ...
The two upper barriers are to be about
1(JOO feet long, of .brush, gravel, cobbles,
piling and masonry, and may raise the de
posits .behind them forty feet, showing
3C.0fi0.000 cubic yards at a cost of seven
tenths, of a cent per yard. The overflow
barrier Is to me 4000 feet long, and that
at Daguerro Point 3000 feet by fourteen
feet hitrh. The nolnt.wlll be cut through
to' rectify the flow and share the flood
overflow. The scheme has many interest-
Ins: details. . , ...;â¢Â¦Â¦
, The project as submitted is novel, since
nothing of the kJndr so far ag known, has
ever, been attempted, and It is to a certain
extent experimental, says the report.
"The various structures are simple, and
are believed- to be safe.- practicable and
reasonably permanent. They can be re
paired if required, and if abandoned, not
maintained or never completed cannot
leave the river in worse shape than at
present. If constructed, itJs believed they
are caoable of storing the debris now in
Yuba River and its tributaries, which Is
far In excess of that in'all the other trib
utaries of the Sacramento River. The
result of this storage cannot be otherwise
than beneficial to the navigation and com
mercial interests of the Sacramento and
Feather rivers."
A significant feature of tne report of in
terest to the miners is this:
"Especial attention is invited to the fact
that the object sought to be accomplished
is the storage of the detritus now in the
Yuba and its tributaries with a view to
the improvement of the rivers below, and
decidedly not with the view of permitting
unlicensed or indiscriminate mining at lo
caltics above the Impounding works.
When the works have been completed and
in operation for several years, there 'will
be time and opportunity to determine
whether or not the system Is capable of
sufficient expansion to warrant an at
tempt at storing therein the tailings from
the hydraulic mines without compelling
each mine to impound any or all of its
debris. The commission believes the pro
ject practicable and worthy of adoption,
and so recommends. It is the only one
thus far evolved which gives reasonable
hope of success and at a very moderate
cost for storage."
Mr. Vischer has been ably serving the
commission for several years in the es
pecial field created by the Caminettl law,
dividing- his time between inspecting hy
draulic mines and working out the debris
problem. In the latter effort he has made
a great number of surveys and borings,
and knows the problem as no one else
does now. While his work has been Un
der the constant direction of Colonel
Mansfield, Major Heuer and Lieutenant
Deakyn, who have had all the other Gov
ernment engineering work of the coast In
their hands, he is the one who has done
the hard work, for which the report
gives him credit by saying:
"Mr. Vischer's labor, thought and skill
in working up a project of such unusual
character and scope merits our highest
appreciation and is worthy of every com
mendation." .
In his long report Mr. Vlscher deals
with "the forces that have run riot with
in the boundaries named," and gives a
full account of the conditions. He con
cludes with this summary, of. the new
project:
"1. It is a project of slow development:
it does not expend any considerable
amount of money in advance of results;
it affords time to acquire experience as
work progresses, and in no instance are
structuree so located as not to make al
terations practicable. It husbands the in
terest account.
"2. It calls for no works of a daring or
experimental type. There are few por
tions which if constructed or partially
completed would not produce benefit and
be separately operative, even in after
ward neglected, and it does not so store
material that the conditions would be
worse, should the structures be destroyed,
than If they had never existed.
"3. It is remedial and beneficial, creates
lands and damages none, and aims to
bring about order where there is now no
order."
Not much land will be required. The
commission will proceed to carry out the
project as soon as permission is Riven,
and is ready to proceed with the $500.<>00
now available without waiting for the ad
ditional $300,000. Several technical ques
tions of legality in connection with the
joint use of the State and Federal appro
priations must be settled, but no serious
obstacles are anticipated.
The debris problems of the Feather,
Bear and other streams are thus rele
prated to the future. So is the matter of
direct assistance to the hydraulic miner.
Each hydraulic miner on the Yuba must
still impound his tailings. But something
has been decided, and the California
Miners' Association, which secured the
money and waited long to see it spent,
may now decide on a new programme.

"In ISSI I was told by two of the best
physicians in Boston, Dr. W and Dr.
B , that I could not expect to live a
year: that I had Brlght's Disease. At
that time I heard of a man who was sup-
posed to have been at death's door and
was stopping 1 , or dying, at tho Common-
wealth Hotel (now the Langham) at the
south end of Boston. His wife, In read-
Ing to him, came across a Warner adver-
tisement and got a bottle of the Safe
Cure. Her husband commenced to take
the medicine, saying nothing to his doc-
tor until after two or three weeks. His
water commenced to show signs of Im-
provement and the man was able to get
up and walk about. When he found that
he was really getting: better, he told the
doctor what he had done and dismissed
him. continuing the medicine, and in three
months this dying man was about his
usual duties, those of an expressman,, and
was finally cured. On the strength of this
cure I got a bottle ana dropped all other
medicines. My doctors sent me to Kan-
sas as a good place to go, out of their
Jurisdiction, and to die. They gave my
wife medicine to carry, enough to last me
until 1 should die. and which I left at
home. I carried one . dozen bottles of
Warner's Safe Cure, and went to a small
place near Junction City, where I had a
cousin who is a physician. 1 had him ex-
amine my water every day, and after a
week he found Improvement, and hon-
estly acknowledged that I was on the
road to recovery. Ana I did recover, al-
though It took a long time, because I was
badly oft, and I took over one hundred
bottles In the course of a year and a half

BATTLESHIP IOWA
PUT THE TERESA
OUT OF ACTION
Spanish . Cruisers Captain
Reviews the Battle of
Santiago.
Declares Admiral Sampson Might
Have Prevented the Sinking of
the Cristobal Colon After
WASHINGTON,- Feb. 25.â The Bureau
of Naval Intelligence has Issued a fresh
volume of its war notes series, and prob
ably the last of them, which will bear on
the battle of Santiago harbor. The pres
ent publication is a translation from the
Spanish by Captain Victor M. Concas y
Palu, former commander of the cruiser
Infanta Maria Teresa and chief of staff
to Admiral Cervera In the battle of
July 3. i ; : â¢
The narrative begins with the exodus of
the devoted squadron from Santiago har
bor. Captain Concas says, in accordance
with previous instructions, the Teresa
headed toward the Brooklyn, hoping to
ram her. This was frustrated by the
Brooklyn's frequently discussed "loop" to
starboard, which Concas says "brought
the lowa and the Texas between her and
Captain Concas. In telling of the suc
cessful sinking of the Teresa and the
other vessels of the squadron, dwells
strongly on a point which he declares an
other critics have overlookedâ namely,
that of owing to the narrow and^ tor
tuous channel past the Morro the fapan
lsh vessels had to come out so far apart
that they were each attacked by the com
bined force of the American squadron and
destroyed in detail, making it practically
a series of combats, each time a. ship
against a squadron. He calls attention
also to the probability that the American
estimate of 3 per cent of hits out of shots
aimed at Cervera's fleet is too low. He
says the most horrible mortality in every
case was in the upper works, where the
shots left no marks except thoso wiped
out by the fire. He says 6 per cent of hits
probably would not be too high.
He credits the lowa with landing the
two 12 or 13 Inch shells which burst the
Teresa's main steam pipe and put her out
of the action when her commander had
a fair chance to escape. The shots, he
says, have been claimed both by the Ore
gon and the Indiana, but he adduces con
siderable evidence that they came from
the lowa. Another peculiar incident
brought out in the narrative and a strik
ing example of Yankee luck was that the
Oregon, in pursuit of the Colon, remained
unconsciously in the "dead angle" be
tween the only guns on the Colon power
ful enough to reach her. The Colon, it
will be remembered, did not have her
big thirty-ton guns, and in the long, stern
chase the Oregon happened always to
keep just on the spot where the upper
deck guna could not be trained on her,
and the Colon could not fire without heav
ing to and losing valuable time. The au
thor indignantly denies that the Colon
was wrecked by her crew after she had
surrendered. He says she was run ashore
and her sea valves opened before her flag
was hauled down. Regarding this Inci
dent the writer says:
The Cristobal Colon was less fortunate than
any of the others, for although going at a
speed of thirteen knots she ran ashore on sand,
and If Admiral Sampson, with a more seaman
like spirit, had ordered the divers to close, the
valves fes could most certainly have saved the
cruiser but with feverish impatience he towed
her off with his own flagship, the New York.
Hardly had the ship been floated when she
began to list, at which moment, with great
dexterity he pushed the Colon back again with
the ram' of his own ship toward the sandy
shoal but it was too late. and. turning over,
that noble and 111-fated cruiser went to the
bottom of the sea forever. The few Americans
and Spaniards who were still on board hastily
saved themselves.
Speaking- of the nature of the wounds
Inflicted by modern naval shell fire. Cap
tain Concas declares them more horrible
than can be described. A boatswain of
the Teresa had four wounds. None of the
men inlured at alt escaped with less than
two. Many, he says, were blown Into
unrecognizable fragments. Captain Lar
zaza of the Oquendo was killed, his exe
cutive officer. Lola, cut In two by a
shell- the third officer, Matos, and the
three lieutenants next In rank all killed,
besides 121 men of the crew. The total
mortality In the fleet reached the awful
figure of 22 per cent of the men enpagred.
In closing the account of the battle the
author says:
We could never complete this chapter tf we
were to relate the Innumerable acts of courage,
but I cannot do less than to mention one which
I raw with my own eyes. The Maria Teresa
had already been abandoned, the flames mount
ing up to the .height of the funnels and pro
jectiles exploding on all sides, and when
everybody thought that no living soul was left
on the ship suddenly a man appeared there
calling for, help. Instantly Jose Sasado cried.
"I will not let that man die!" and threw him
self into the water. He climbed up the blood
sfalned sides of the ship, seized the man, car
ried him down on his shoulders, Rnd swim
miriK with him to the shore, laid his burden
on tho beach. It waa hardly possible to believe
that that shapeless form was a man with four
teen woiiads. who must have been left on board
as dead. ' . - â¢ ' - '

fetching affair. On Saturday next the
great $10,000 Burns handicap will be de
cided, and to-day's race may give a line

LOOKED INTO BY
FAIR'S SLEUTHS
Characters of Mrs. Craven's
Witnesses Are to Be
Aired in Court.
Alleged Widow of the Dead Million
aire Will Have a Trying Tima
When Case Reoptns
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven-Fatr (?) will pro
ceed this morning in Judge Troutfs de
partment of the Superior Court, under tha
tire of Attorney Fierson's cross-examina
tion, with her attempt to prove that sha
is the lawful widow of the late James G.
Fair and rightfully entitled to- a family
allowance from his vast estate. It is to>
be presumed that she has taken advan
tage of the court's recess to brace her
self up for the trying ordeal.
Every effort Is to be made by the Fair
attorneys to break down her testimony
and the evidence which she expects from
some of her moat important witnesses.
During the few days sines court ad
journed the detectives in the employ of
the estate have not been idle. The record
of every prospective witness ha 3 been
looked up. Every hint at probable testi
mony that haa been drawn frum Mrs.
Craven-Fair hÂ«s received the attention
of the sleuths who are arrayed on the
side of the opposition.
In the event of being unable to impeach
the testimony of those who may go on th*>
stand for Airs. Craven-Fair the repre
sentatives of the dead Senator's esta:o
have decided to attack their private char
acters if there la any rule of law b>
which such evidence can be placed befor*
the court.
With the object of carryfcipr this ldÂ»a.
Into execution a number of the Fair de
tectives Tiave been spending much of their
time lately In Alameda. Ben F. Lamborn.
the City Clerk of the municipality aeroÂ«Â»
the bay. has been under the scrutiny of
their searching eyes. His whole history
has been delved Into and every detail o?
his official llfp in Alameda has received
attention. The condition of his books
even has not been overlooked, and it In
stated that the report of the accountar.:
who has been expertins them for the city
may be forced into the Craven-Fair casa
In the event of his becom'ner a witness.
The detectives will also try to introdue*
a statement said to have been made by
Lamborn to the rf?Â»*ct that in the event
of Mrs. Craven-Fair getting any consid
erable sum of money from the Fair estate
he "would be in clover" for the rest of
his days on earth. This, they claim,
creates the impression that influence*
other than friendship prompts Lamborn
to array himself on the side of his former
schoolteacher.
Ruirors of compromise are floating
arcuml promiscuously, but they are em
phatically denied by both tr*Â» Fair and tha
Craven-Fair end of the case.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1900.
<n J$ ART REBESKT staggered the attaches of the Insane department of
//\/\ the Receiving Hospital when she made her appearance yesterday
II Ik mornln 5 t0 be locked up on a charge of Insanity. She looked like "an
inflated balloon and seemed a stout, elderly woman, but when Mrs.
Bwett, the matron, disrobed her she was in reality a email, thin woman,
not weighing more than 110 pounds. She wore ten pairs of stockings, four
skirts, four waists and a sugar loaf pattern hat weighing over ten pounds. -
Inside her stockings she had a frying pan filled with bread and a sauce
pan and In pockets made in her dresses and stockings she had a miscellane
ous collection of provisions and articles stored. She had sugar In one pocket,
tea in another, coffee in another and in others a hand looking glass, can of
prepared soup, soap, knife, matches, needles and "thread, silk ribbons, pieces
of lace, combs, alarm clock, package of shoe polish, pieces Â¦, of linen, hand
kerchiefs and other articles too numerous to mention. Her clothes and con
tents could not have. weighed less than 250 pounds, and she carried the weight
around with her all the time.
Policeman Kentzel.had observed her on two or three occasions hanging
around a vacant lot on Steiner street, and after questioning her concluded
that she was mentally unbalanced, and sent her to the hospital. She said she
was a native of Germany and was 39 years of age, but she looks twenty
years older.
"I have -lived In this city,", she said, "for the past thirteen years.- I have
a brother here, but have never been able to find him. I have no home and
have no money to pay .for a room, so I sleep wherever I get the chance, I
have to do my cooking In vacant lots sometimes. I get all the bread I ask
for from bakers, and manage to get enough of everything to live. I get the
laces and ribbons and other small things from yards where I pick them up.
No, I was never married." -
The woman talks intelligently, and her mind does not seem at all affected.
She appears to be simply eccentric in her hahits and mode of life, and has
the appearance of having- "seen better . days." She objects :to being- "ques
tioned, and wants it understood that it is nobody's business what she does.
How she could carry such a weight around with her without tiring in a mys
tery \ Â¦;Â¦ Â¦- ' â¢ <.

LUXOR, the great white and black
greyhound from the kennels of Cur
tis & Sons, but which is the prop
erty of Albert Curtis, went fairly
flying through th 3 John Grace cup
stake yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
In the presence of the greatest crowd ever
assembled at a coursing- park In the
United States he Justified the expecta
tions of his admirers by winning handily.
He defeated Retina R. Silver Lyon. Emm
Pasha, Royal Flush and Narcissus point
less; Chicago Boy 4 to 1, and in the final
Connemara 5 to i. Up to the final the
outcome was never in doubt, as Luxor Â¦
fairly fiew over the ground, breaking
down his hares before they could get half
way across the field.
His style of running is deceptive. He
moves with as little friction as a finely
adjusted piece of machinery. He crouches
down to his work with his head parallel
with the ground and his long muzzle
fairly skimming along the surface of it.
He was lit to run for his owner's life, and
so little drain was there on his vitality
that he could apparently romp through
another such stake to-day.
It was not till the final that he was
called upon to put forth his best efforts.
In this he met James Ucan'a Connemara.
which won the stake in 1M)Â». Old "Con.,"
as he Is affectionately called by the fol
lowers of coursing, was the hero of thÂ«
day. Each round nis admirers predicted
he would be retired. As he won time after
time, all the sentiment of the spectators
went out to him, as it does when any
great old champion goes out to battle
against the odds which youth and fresh
vitality give. In the next to the last
round he ran a "bye" course, which en
titled him to meet the great Luxor in the
linal. When he came out for this the
band played â¢â¢Hail! Hail! the Chief Has
Come, while the spectators cheered
"Jimmy" Dean and his dog.
Connemara had shown his old-time
speed during the day, and also showed
the bulldog viciousness which he pos
sesses. The new champion and the old
were slipped to a email but sturdy hare,
which, according to custom. waÃ selected
by Superintendent Charles Griswold, the
idea being- to give the dogs in the finai
a fair test.
Luxor led to the hare by two and a
half lengths, securing the nrst turn. He
stumbled in making a drive for the hare,
and. burying his muzzle In the yielding
earth turned almost a somersault, rolling
over several times. In the meantime the
hare came around to Connemara In a cir
cle. "Con" stumbled and fell, and Luxor,
taking the shorter course, took two turns
out of the hare. Connemara, In the mean
time, had scored two turns and finally
killed. The score by points was 5 to 4 .
The Belle Brandon cup stake was won
by George N'ethercotfs Freda C, trained
in the kennels of B. E. de. B. Lopez &
Son. Captain P. M. Clarkson's Flower of
Gold was runner-up.
The first dog to get a severe course In
the big stake was Cavalier. He met Sir
Pasha in the morning, and they ran over
three minutes before the hare was fin
ally killed by a relief dosr. Slsquoc was
drawn, having lost four pounds in weight
during the previous night. The biggest
upset of the day was the defeat of Bohe
by Warship, the former being favorite at
4 to 1. Wnitehead won two courses, but
lost to Chicago Boy after an undecided.
The weatner was not "cup day
weather," as fog obscured the sun. It
settled down upon the field occasionally,
but not sufficiently to obscure the vision
of the spectators.
The judging and the slipping were

6BAKERSFIELD. Feb. 25.â "Dan" W.
Carraichael of Sacramento came
Into town yesterday on a special
Pullman, heading a delegation of
well-known Sacramento people,
Â¦who journeyed with him in order to in
spect the Kern River oil district. In the
party were the following: J. L. Gillis, G.
S. Brand, Frank Whitmore, M. Gageby,
F. A. Daroux. B. Cavanaugh. W. C. Hall,
Wilbur George. W. M. Sim?, I. Boysen,
E. Phillips, C. C. Robertson. H. A.
French. N. B. Krlpp. J. A. Woodson,
"Bob" Rlchardf=on. E. C. Rutherford, E.
F. Hadley and C. EC Lipman. They were
Joined li^re by Railroad Commissioner
Klackstock and Secretary Sesnon of the
n*tlroad Commission. As soon as possi
ble after they arrived they were on the
way to the Kern River oil fields, where
they pasFtd an entire day looking about
vr.6rr the guidance of W. F. Bryant, a
contraclor for the drilling and develop
ment of oil wells. A representative of
The Call accepted an invitation to make
the tour of inspection at the same time.
A Sunning Study.
The opportunity was excellent to make
a running study of that comparatively
new thingâ an oil boom In Central Cali
fornia. The town was filled with stran
gers. All the roads were traveled by men
of more or lees means, on the way to or
from the oil wells. Every one was free
to tell his experience. As for the rest, the
<iay was fine and in the clear air in almost
the entire field of the Kern River oil dis
trict activity was In view from any one
hill or another. Booms are pretty much
alike in one respect; they engage the ma
jor part of the conversation of the resl
c>nts of the town and visitors to the
Â¦Â¦booming" section. As a natural conse
quence information was not difficult to
get. From morning until night, up and
down hills and into the river bed of the
Jvern River, the large Inspection party
rode in a string of wagons, asking ques
tions. personaJlv looking at the actual
production of oil; computing on the fly
leaves of books or convenient scraps of
paper the financial side of the matter.
Caused by the Boom.
There are 2000 more persons in Bakers
field and the country Immediately sur
rour.dlng it than there were last Septem
ber, and they are all directly connected
â¢with oil in come way. By day the town
|l not much more lively than any other
interior town of similar size and geo
graphical position. At night the hotels are
crowded with excited men. and the hum
of '"oil talk" is on every street corner un
til late hours. At the end of a drive of
fibout four miles from the town scores of
derricks begin to loom up in every direc
tion Jets of Bteam and columns of smoke
color th<Â« air east, north, pouth. Creeping
up the sides of a pcore of hills are six and
eiVht-horse teams, hauling water, lum
ber pipe, oil well machinery and provis
ions ViR-ht and day the smoke and the
feam denote that the prospecting for or
actual pumping of oil is ceaseless. When
The day force of drillers and their asslst
Â¦Bta pet though their work the night shift
is ready to keep things moving.
Bakefsfield has two new shops where
nothing but work upon oil machinery Is
performed. Both chops are driven to top
capacity. All the carpenters available are
putting up derricks on the hills and in the
valleys. Teamsters from the mountains
hav**the chance to keep their teams busy
all the time. There is a shortage of Iron
Ismail. Ordinary wells run for a period
I of years before they are exhausted."
The main fact that any observer would
notice ls that most of the derricks are
new. In fact, there was very little known
about the Kern River district until last
October. Since then the influx has been
steady. Hundreds of strangers are con
stantly arriving. They are to be encoun
tered at every turn among the hills. The
next fact, not to be overlooked, is that
wherever there Js actually a well pump
ing, there are others that are being drilled
near by. The "33" plant has seven wells
at work. One of these was operated last
fall. The others have been down to oil
only a few days and the pumping of them
began simultaneously. The largest plant
operated in the district up to date is at
Oil City.
The New Oil City.
As a "city," the small settlement of half
a dozen low, cheap houses, scarcely more
than cabins, is hardly perceptible; but
there the Santa Fe and the Southern Pa
cific interests are working. The Santa Fe
has sixteen pumps going at that place
and all are producing oil. There are at
least 100 new wells being drilled In the dis
trict and fifty wells are completed. In
this section are the Reed Oil Company,
the Sacramento Oil Company, the Gray
Eagle, the Peerless, the Monte CrlÃto, the
West Shore and the Imperial.
After the Sacramentans had thoroughly
looked over the entire district they, re
turned to the capital. Some are con
cerned in the Sacramento Oil Company.
Others were guests.
pipe and the well owners resort to bor- j
rowing. I
Some Novel Sights.
Driving two miles farther, the party
! came to the Sacramento Oil Company's
wells. This was the first sight that many
of the visitors had ever enjoyed of an oil
well in actual operation. Ttie wells are
between hills. One was pumping oil with
steady progress. The output was a thick,
blackproduct which the visitors weretold
was about 60 per cent lubricant and 15 per
cent illumlnant. A stream of oil about the
thickness of a man's thumb was steadily
pouring into a large tank of wood. The
other well at the depth of 500 feet had oil
eand, but not oil, and must go deeper.
The well had been driven down that dis
tance in ten days. The well that is yield
ing was begun January 6.
Topography and Oil Sand.
From the hill above the Sacramento Oil
Company's wells a fair idea of the topog
raphy of the surrounding country was
procurable. The surface is broken by
many low hills, but not so steep or so high
that teaming is interfered with. Derricks
appear upon the tops of hills and in the
valleys. The theory of the oil men ls that
there is a stratum of oil sand extending
from the Kern River and for a distance of
some miles and that it is practically un
broken. Following out this idea the
other interesting theory has been evolved
that there is no such thing as an oil ex
pert discoverer for that particular sec
tion. The fact ls that the roughly de
scribed lines traced over the sandy hills
by the derricks take in a tract tnat is
about five miles wide at its greatest diam
eter. Consequently It appears that the
same sort of oil sand exists at points as
far apart as five miles, for the oil is all
about the same In the entire district, and
this is pointed to as an indication and
confirmation of the theory that the oil
sand belt is five miles wide.
This point 13 brought out with particu
larity for this reason. The wells at Los
Angeles are about 40 feet apart in many
instances. "If." t=ay the Kern River peo
ple, "the wells here were only 40 feet
apart and this whole great area was
filled in. what a vast proposition that
would be!" That is the basis of the large
expectation that many hold concerning
a huge development in this section.
The Pumping Jack.
The Sacramento Oil Company will have
about 100 barrels of oil per day from the
present exploitation, according to the in
dications. The wells In the district aver
age from 20 to 100 barrels daily. Two men
are sufficient to operate the drilling ma
chinery. When their hours of labor are
over two others take their places. "When
wells have been developed and the sand
is all out so that the output is practically
all oil from two to twenty wells may be
pumped simultaneously with one boiler
and one engine by the usÂ«e of the "pump
ing Jack," which is a device made up of
a large wheel turned by cogs and sur
mounted by two eccentrics, which carry
wire cables in all directions to connect
with pumps. At one of the tracts known
as "23." which has been developed by Ba
kersfleld bankers to quite an extent,
seven pumps are now propelled with one
pumping Jack. That reduces the expense
very largely.
Figuring Out Profits.
Here is the way that some of the oil
men figure it out for profit: "Oil is worth
a dollar a barrel. At that rate a plant
that produces 150 barrels per diem would
earn $1000 per week, less the expense. Once
the wells are going there is little to do
that cannot be performed by compara
tively unskilled labor. Two or three men
could take care of a plant running twenty
wells employing the pumping jack, so
that the expense of operation would be
T DECLARE before Almighty God
and you, very reverend Father.
I and in the presence of this congre
Â¦*â¢ gatlon, that I hereby solemnly re
new for the following year the promise
of temperance, according to the rules
of that branch of the League of the
Cross of which I am a member; and
may God give me grace to keep this,
my pledge, in the name of the Father,
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen."
With upraised right hands nearly 3000
youths, members of the League of the
Cross, yesterday afternoon solemnly
promised to forswear the use of liquor.
The scene in St. Mary's Cathedral,
where the ceremonies were held, was
as dramatic as it was interesting. The
sacred edifice was crowded to tho
doors with members of the organiza
tion and parishioners who were desir
ous of witnessing the annual renewal
of pledges. A number of policemen
were necessary to keep the crowds
which tried to gain admittance m
check.
The services opened with the singing
of "Veni Creator" by the entire con
gregation and cathedral choir. The
young voices filled the church with
swoet sound and made the music a
feature of the ceremonies. At the con
clusion of the singing of the beautiful
hymn Rev. Phlllo O'Ryan, spiritual di
rector of the League of the Cross, of
fered up a devout prayer for the
church- and the civil authorities.

cesses or failures, whereas, in tho
cause of temperance, the members of
the League of the Cross were ilsrhthi^

their reward would be greater an I
their fame undying. He directed their
attention to the renewal of their sol
emn pledge and congratulated his con
gregations- on their manliness and
strength of character.
Then followed the prayer of conse
cration, after which the pledge was re
peated by the young men. who then
knelt and prayed for a confirmation of
â¢what they had done. As the priest and
attendants proceeded from the Pacri.-stv
for benediction the congregation knelt
down and raised their voices in ainirinir
"O Salutaris." Rev. Father Prender

singing of the "Te Deum."

NAVAL RESERVES
OUT FOR A RUN
ROUND THE BAY
Old Ship Marion Freed From
Her Moorings for a
Few Hours.
Steamed Up the Bay and Back Again
to Anchor at Her Former
Berth in Warship
Bow.
The old sloop of war Marion lazily drew
her hook out of the mud yesterday and
started on a cruise around tho bay. She
did not go far, only just far enough to
show rhe cculd go farther, and than she.
came back to her former anchorhga am!
dropped to sleep there again. She Is the
ship of the naval reserve and the naval
reserves manned her, and they took her
out and brought her bar,*; without a
break and without a professional fluke of
any kind. ;V
The first piece of work of any magni
tude the Marion presented to her crew
was about as badly fouled an anchor as
a self-respecting warship would be willing
to fix up. The chain that holds her is a
heavy one, and she had wound it around
fluke" and stock and shank until when the
hook came to the top of the water a ball
of chain a yard wide was tne first evi
dence of its appearance. With the fouled
anchor swinging at her hawse pipe she
made her way up the bay, and then after
reaching the basin off Alcatraz she hove
to and the anchor was partly cleared. In
the meantime the jib and the spanker had
been bent and set. and these, added to her
leisurely old engines, made her pick up
quite a respectable wake. She spreads
the canvas of a frigate, and when it is
all set her engines will have a hard time
to keep up with her.
Captain N. T. James was in command,
and the officers with him were Lieuten
ant Commander T. A. Nerney, executive
officer; Lieutenant W. F. Burke, naviga
tor: Lieutenants Bonney (chief engineer),
T. S. Harloe and C. R. Alberger; Lieuten
ants Junior Grade G. E. Kemmerer, Wil
liam Morrison and J. G. Morrlsey (passed
assistant surgeon); Ensigns Henry Peter
son, Speck (assistant engineer). J. K.
Burke, who was in charge of the steam
launch: J. C. Kelly, acting paymaster,
and J. F. Murphy. The warrant officers
were Boatswain Richard Schnalle, Car
penter Henry Harris and Apothecary D.
N. McMillan. Ensign Armstrong of the
Santa Barbara division was also on board,
and was assigned to duty.
Several of the officers came on board
Saturday night and messed in the ward
room for breakfast and lunch. The men
came aboard during the morning, and as
soon as they came over the side the
boatswain put them to work and kept
them hard at it for the day. and he knows
how to keep sailors busy. With the men of
the naval reserve, however, to work on
the old ship is to play, and they give
their best to the service they love. It
falls hardest on the engineer's division.
Down in the stoke hold it is hot as any
man-o'-war, and although few knew It,
there was one man fainted at his furnaces
yesterday and when helped on deck he
refused to- stay longer than it took him
to recover.
The Marlon will be moved from her an

H. M. S. ICARUS ARRIVES.
Sloop of War Drops In on Her
Way to Esquimau.
The British sioop-of-war Icarus arrived
from Acapulco yesterday. She is on her
way from Central America to Eaqulmalt,
B. C, and stops here on her way north
for supplies.
Three months ago the Warspite, Pliao
ton and Icarus, under command of Ad
miral Beaumont, sailed on a cruise to
South America;- At Guatemala the ad
miral and his officers were royally enter
tained by President Estrada Cabrera, and
at Panama the squadron received a splen
did reception. From Panama the War
spite ai.w Phaeton proceeded to Peru, and
the little Icarus started back home. She
is not much bigprer than the revenue cut
ter lucCulloch. The Icarus was here onco
before about five years ago. She is ft
composite boat of 970 tons displacement,
and was built in 1885.
The transport Hancock will be released
from quarantine to-day, and the work of
removing the bodies of the soldier dead
from the vessel will at once begin. Thcro
are over 500 bodies aboard the Hancock,
and these will be taken to the Presidio
for interment or to be forwarded to the
relatives of the deceased I If It is so de
sired.
Reinsurance on the British ship Annie
Thomas is now quoted at 50 ocr cent, and
that on the American ship May Flint at
35 per cent. The former is 210 days out
from Cardiff, for Acapuleo. and the Flint
la 105 days out from Hongkonjr. for Ta
coma. It Is feared that the latter vessel
has been caught in a typhoon and been
partially dismasted. Captain Meredith of
the Annie Thompson is making his first
voyage In that vessel. He was formerly
on the British ship Dominion, but he left
that vessel the trip before she was lost.

OIL MEN HOPE
TO GET BELIEF
FROM CONGRESS
Newly Drafted Petroleum
Lands Bill on Its Way
to Washington.
The new petroleum lands bill, as drawn
by the mineral lands committee of t'.ie
California Miners' Association and a
number of leading oil men, was sent last
week to the California delegation at
Washington by J. M. Wright, chairman
of the miners' committee. It was espe
cially directed to Congressman Waters,
who is asked to father and push the meas
ure in Congress.
Curtis H. Lindley, who is about to gj
to Washington on legal business, writes:
"When I reach Washington I shall pecurc
an introduction .to the chairman of the
committee having charge of these mat
ters, Interview our California delegation
and do everything I can to carry out the
desires of the association. All the Influ
ence possible will be wielded in behalf of
the measure, which would do so much to
straighten out the tangle in oil land mat
ters in the San Joaquln Valley and in
Southern California." . ;. ',
The Santa Fe Company is- changing
twenty-eight valley road engines in order
to use oil as fuel. Oil tanks will be dis
tributed along the line, and when the road
is opened for traffic to San Francisco noth
ing else will be used on the system in this
State. The supply for the road north of
Tehachapi will come from both the Kern
County and Fresno County fields. The
Southern Pacific is steadily increasing its
use of oil and the railroads alone offer a:i
enormous market for the product. Here
the State's oil product trebled It would un
doubtedly Boon find a demand for it all at
but slightly diminished prices. ThÂ» fu
ture holds no threat of overproduction of
this cheap and convenient fuel in Califor
nia.
The roads from Bakersfield to the Kern
River oil district are getting very bad and
the oil men offer to furnish oil to sprinKiu
them if the Supervisors will do the rest.
They are prospecting for oil as far
north as Shasta County. Four men have
located eighty acres on Dry Creek, a
tributary of Cow Creek in Stinking Can
yon. There is a vile odor and a black
stuff exudes from fissures which inspire
confidence.
Sixty oil wells have been prostrated
by a gale at Summerlnnd. where new
wells are being sunk under the ocean.
Ventura County Is enjoying a lively oil
boom also. Many thousands of acres of
land are being secured for exploitation.
At the Park and Cliff.
It was a dreary day at the park and
beach yesterday. The few people that
ventured out went shivering on their
way in search of pleasure, but soon tired
of the undertaking and returned home to
the comforts of the fireside. But one ac
cident occurred during the day, and that
was not serious. Miss A. "Willy, who re
sides at 125 Duncan street, was knocked
down by one of the park busses and suf
fered a strained kneejoint. She was
taken to her home for treatment.
Although no special attractions were on
the bill the crowd at the Chutes was big
as ever. The guests of the resort en-

preached an able sermon to his
young auditors. His theme was tem
perance, and he expatiated on the good
to be gained from following such a
life. He dwelt on the terrible war now
waging In South Africa, and stated
that the men engaged in the death
struggle would receive no reward for
their heroism : that they would die and
soon be forgotten, and only a few gen-
joyed themselves with the various fea

TyUBLIC sentiment is against the reopening of Ingleside and opposed to the unrestricted operations
J^of the dozvntowii poolrooms. Practically the sentiment is unanimous. Aside from a mere hand-
ful of greedy gamblers who prey upon the rising' generation and who thrive at the expense of the
cify's honor and morals, no one wants these incubators of crime to continue. The Board of Supervis
ors cannot mistake the meaning of the cry of. indignation that arose when it sccincd possible that the
racetrack conspirators would break through the barrier which keeps them beyond the city's limits. The
members cannot afford to act contrary to the wishes of the people who placed them in their positions.
If they were to permit the reopening of this kindergarten of crime the first iron-clad hoof that
went coursing around the track, clanking against the empty skulls of Ingleside's victims, would sound
the political dcathkncll of every official responsible for the outrage.
So important is the matter to the moral zuelfare of San Francisco that many ministers 0/ the
gospel in the city entered their pulpits yesterday for the express purpose of raising their voices in pro- ,
test and appealing to good citizenship to save the community from the assaults of the gamblers and
blacklegs. They held up before their congregations that bloody list of those unfortunates who were lured
to Ingleside and suffered the penalty. They urged that the young men and young women of the city
be saved from the temptation thai would be held out to them if Inglcsidc's gates were â¢thrown open and
the poolrooms permitted to continue in business.
Can the Supervisors ignore these appeals ?Â¦Â¦ Can 'they afford to desert the ranks of decency and
morality and ally themselves with gamblers and propagators of vice?

also known deluded parents who foolishly
expended their savings and their earnings
in the betting ring, leaving their children
to suffer for life's necessities. Our young
women are led to ruin by the poolroom
system, and this should be prevented In
future by curtailing that evil power. The
racetrack and the poolroom leads them
into spheres that they should never enter
and they would not be tempted to do so
if they did not exist. I have no objection
to racing when it has for its object the
exhibition of equine speed, but when bet

weapon. Rellly said he was going home
about 4 o'clock yesterday morning; when
Sinclair stepped out of the doorway of
417 Mason street and struck him a vio^Â»nt
blow on the head with a cane, smashing
his hat and cutting open his scalp. The
assault was unprovoked. Sinclair was ar
rested yesterday afternoon.
AT thÂ© Stewart Memorial United Pres
byterian Church last evening Rev.
\V. E. Dugan, the pastor, raised a
voice against the polluting Influence of
the poolrooms and the misery resulting
from Ingleslde, to
â¢which the Super
pM Â¦ \ visors cannot turn
#a deaf ear. The pre
lude to his sermon
follows:
"I cannot think
that the present Su
pervisors will stain
their record by even
listening to a peti
tion to reopen Ingle
side. To open this
track is to swing
open a door that
leads ' by a short
-. - T J route to the hell of
â¢ mm â~â m this and the other
.world. The immoral
REV. w. E. DUGAN," lnfluence of tr-e
racetrack, as carried
on at Ingleslde, Is beyond all conception.
If the Supervisors consent to open the
gambling vice, they will .immerse them
selves in as black a crime as if they
turned a train load of hungry tigers loose
in tho streets of our city.
"We have shoved the black-hearted,
blear-eyed, bloodthristy monster across
the county line, and In the name of the
purity of the woman and the integrity of
the man let us throttle this great in
iquity when It attempts to-morrow even-
Ins to shove its blood-stained paw into
our midst. If we give this hefl-hearted
monster a foothold, it will pounce upon
our city with all the ferocity of a cruel,
savage, hungry panther, reared and tan
talized by the savagery of perdition.
"Let our Supervisors remember that to
reopen the Ingleside track means that
every inch â¢of it will be paved with
wrecked characters, blasted hopes and
ruined homes, and cemented by human
blood. No business house of the city Is
safe with its employes as patrons of gam
bling institutions. If we are going to li
cense such criminality as Is inseparably
connected with a gambling racetrack,
why not license pickpockets, burglars and
all classes of parasites feeding and fatten
ing on a downtrodden public?
"The friction from the crushed charac
ters, hopes and fortunes, which the agent
of hell has already hurled down to ruin,
lights a flame that burns away every ex
cuse for reopening, the avenue of blood
and plunder.
'Oh. beautiful San Francisco, queen of
the Pacific, with thy countenance of
sparkling like polished diamonds In an
ocean of gold, rise in the name of hu
manity and wash your hands from' the
polluting crime bound up In racetrack
gambling."
JOSEPH KORBEL DIES
AFTER A SHORT ILLNESS
Joseph Korbel, a member of the firm of
F. Korbel & Bros., clear-box manufac
turers at 723 Bryant -?reet. passed away
yesterday, after a short illness, at the
family residence, which adjoins their big
mill.
, Deceased was one of the most important
figures in the German colony of this city,
a leading member of all the German-so
cieties, and one of the owners of one ( of
the largest vineyards in the State. It is
located at Korbel Station. Sonoma Coun
ty, and had branches in San . Francisco
and Chicago. He also controlled a large
lumber tract at Arcata, Humboldt Coun
ty, which furnished material for the mills
in operation in that county and in San
Francisco. >hÂ»hw
. Deceased. was the founder of the "Wasp,
and the discoverer of Keppler, the car
toonist, who finally became world famous.
* Mr. Korbel was born in Bohemia in
March, i 044, and came, to this country
with' hi3 brother, Francis Korbel. when
quite a young. man. They established a
business in this city, and to-day it is
rated as one of the big industries. â¢ :
Services over tne body "will be held at
the family residence on Wednesday morn
ing. The interment will : be/in- Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery. Â¦Â¦r-jatsJuÃmaam
AS a prelude to his morning sermon
yesterday, Rev. Philip Combe, pastor
of the Richmond Congregational
Church, appealed to his congregation to
use its influence against the reopening of
Inglpside and the unrestricted operation
of the downtown poolrooms. In part he
Â¦aid:
"One of the best things that has been
done during the past few years to pre
vent crime in San Francisco was the pas
sage by the Board of Supervisors of an
ordinance to close the Ingleside racetrack,
which was signed by Mayor Phelan on
March 13, last year, and became an effec
tive law. It is stated that a movement
is to be made on Monday night to get
the present board to- rescind this action
of their predecessors. It does not seem
possible that such an attempt can be suc
cessful.' The men who are to be thus ap
proached were elected in the belief that
they were in sympathy with the era of
good government so well begun, and that
they would use the j>ower given them
to help to make our ?ity one of the best
ethically and esthetlcal^y. as it is locally
and topographically. Scarcely anything
could occur that would be more injurious
to healthful growth, more ruinous to busi
ness integrity, more degenerating to pub
lic morals, more defiant to good sentiment,
more offensive to official trust than this.
It behooves us as Christian citizens to
pray that God in his infinite wisdom and
almighty power will co influence the
hearts of the men in whose hands the
welfare of our city so largely rests that
they shall resist every effort put forth to
make them violate the confidence that
has .been reposed in them and the honor
that has been conferred upon them."
INGLESIDE'S DUPES
FILL SAN QUENTIN
A MENACE TO THE
CITY'S MORALITY
REV. JOHN HEMPHILL. of Calvary
Presbyterian Church urged the mem
bers of his congregation last evening
to use their personal influence with the
Supervisors to maintain the barrier
against Ingleslde
and the downtown
f"~â â mm^ poolrooms. Refer
Â¦^""~*Â»v ring to the â¢ evil of
â¢ the places, he said:
m h "I Â¦Â¦ know Â¦ some-

jmTVTiPv'pmiT nal inflictions. If
JOHN HEMFHIU* thfi cnurcheg do not
stand for moral purification, they stand
for nothing. I am informed that an effort
is on foot to reopen the Ingleside race
track. â¢ I am opposed to the race track be
cause the race track is opposed to good
morals. , I have seen . women returning
from the race track bedraggled, feverish,
excited, with the gleam of gambling, gains
or losses, in their blood-shot eyes. I do
not think such women make good wives
and mothers. I do not think that Is the
stuff for the moral upbuilding of our city.
But 'open the race track,' we are told,
'and It attracts people to our city who
will spend money with a free hand.' So
does the carrion attract the buzzard; but
we want neither buzzard nor carrion.
There is financial gain that is. moral loss,
and there is financial loss that is moral
gain. They are talking of a new sewer
system for Greater San Francisco. The
churches should do their duty in keeping
the moral sewers clean. I am opposed to
the opening of Ingleside. and I know that
this church is a unit behind me. Do you
know any of our city fathers? Use your
influence with them, and do what you can
to prevent iniquity from coming in upon
us like a flood. As a church, let us stand
for the moral uplifting of our city."
FUTURE OF YOUTH
HANGS IN BALANCE
REV. DR. HUTSINPILLER of Central
M. E. Church spoke yesterday morn-
Ing on the topic, "Where Shall the
Boy Be Found?" and In the evening on
"The Mistake of the Young Man." He
referred in both ser-
mons to the neces- i
slty of making it as /-*~N__
probable as possible / â C~V
that a boy should be /f N \
found on the way. to V [ \
noble manhood, and I*,^ ?â¢{
that young men ; I>J
should enter the â¢ l/vft z/_z /_
arena of manly pur- V^^ f. '
suits full of hope X^ f\ Â¦
and girded with the J vr
best habits. This A TOv^y^
was in line to clear L< rj / '
and relevant re- v^v/
marks concern Ing V^
the opening of the 1Â° - XV
Ingles ide track.
Briefly he said: REV.
ChHstianity^is 1 the^S-D. HUTSINPILLER
open gate and the highway for manhood,
and whatever hinders this deserves the
enmity and constant opposition of all who
believe in developing out of young men
and happy ohildhood a type of moral and
splendid manliness. Would to God that
we -could engage all men In helping the
boys into industrious, sober, honest, clean
citizenship. It ought not to take press
and pulpit and school teacher and re
former and mass-meeting to teach our
city governments that It is ever wise and
economical and right to eliminate and
banish centers and fountains of swift and
flowing temptation from those' who throng
our city. Whatever cultivates and fos
ters the desire for undue excitement,- the
passion for gambling, the desire to get
something for nothing or much for little
is a menace to the boy.
"If the facts are clear to us, we can
see clearly . and with anxiety that the
proposed opening of Ingleside racetrack
and the attendant temptations is a men
ace to the already overtempted and much
excited and susceptible youth of our city.
Pool dealing in general and particular la
wastefulness. Granting that men must
have recreation and some sport, no sensi
ble man is willing to concede that what
has proved a nuisance in the past and
was closed because It was bad in its ef
fects on the morals and manhood of the
city â yes, and the womanhood, tooâ no
clear-brained man, I say, is ready to con
cede that the Board of Supervisors of our
city can open again this avenue to gamb
ling and wastefulness."
JEWISH CAKEWALK
WAS GREATLY ENJOYED
A decided novelty . was introduced by
the Hebrew artists, Julius Rosenwasser
and A. Tanzman, at the benefit given last
night to Rosenwasser at Odd Fellows'
Hall. It consisted of the "Hebrew cake
walk, and was greatly enjoyed by a
large audience. Tanzman was attired in
the ancient costume of the Polish Jew,"
and Rosenwasser assumed -the female
Part. The act was a travesty on the pop
ular negro Cakewalk, in which the two
artists 1 sang the "Ragtime Song" to He
brew words, composed by Mr. Rosenwas
ser. The evolutions of the pair were de
cidedly amusing, and had to be repeated.
The great musical comedy. "The Miser;
or, The Merchant of Russia," was also
presented, with the following cast:
Gronom. a ; miser. A. Tar.zman; Salmon, a
merchant. S.Greenberp: Leah, his wife. Mme.
F. Greenbent: Rachel, their daughter. Miss M.
Schneider: Slesktnd, a lottery ajrent,' I. Fried
lander; .Nachmon, a letter â¢ carrier, S. Left;
Chajem, a retired merchant, Lemke. a match
maker, Josef, Rachel's lover. PesseJ, Salmon's
cook, Julius Rosenwasser; musical leader. Pro
fessor: Maurice Roee.
During the action of the play the follow
ing sonÂ«s were sung: "Marriage is Good,
A. Tanzman; "When I Was a Cook";
"Jewish Serenade"; "Because I .Love
You" (in -Hebrew). Julius â¢ Rosenwasser;
duet. "Promise to Be True,".J. Rosenwas
ser and Miss -M. Schneider.

I do not believe that we elected that kind

though it must be a false alarm. But it
is a good thing to be alarmed about. - ThÂ«
