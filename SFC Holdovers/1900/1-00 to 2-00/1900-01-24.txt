LONDON, Jan. 24, 6a. m.â A dispatch from Pretoria says a great battle has raged
sixty hours. The British attempted the relief of Ladysmith Saturday. Thirty thou
sand British infantry under Buiier and Warren were three times repulsed wjth great
loss. Forty British cannon were engaged in the terrific bombardment.
the Idea of the Intervention of European
powers is gaining adherents in Influential
quarters. The Dally Mail's correspondent
regards the signs as unmistakable and
mentions especially suggestions printed in
the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office Jour
nals.
MONTAGU WHITE IS
PLEADING IN VAIN
WASHINGTON. Lliuftr : y-2.lontasu
Whitfi, who has come to trÂ«e United. States
in the interest of the Boers,- unofficially
discussed the situation, in South Africa
to-day with Secretary Hay and made it
plain to that official that the Transvaal
republic desired the mediation of the
United States to end the war. Nothing
that Mr. White stated; however, is calcu
lated to cause any change in {he attitude
of this Government.
"That attitude will continue to be strict.
Impartial and absolute neutrality," said
an official with whom I talked. The only
"An attempt will be made to seize Spion Kop, the salient
of which forms the left of the enemy's position facing Trichards
Drift, and which divides it from the position facing Potgieters
Drift. It has considerable command over the enemy's in
trenchments."
BOER HEAD LAAGER, LADYSMITH, Monday,
Jan. 22. â A battle has been raging along Oliviers Hock road
since Saturday between the Boers under Pretorius and 6000
British. The fighting is in full swing at Spion Kop. The
Boers under Botha and Cronje have been sent thither. The
British elsewhere are only making a reconnoisance of the Boer
positions. President Steyn was under fire at the foremost posi
tion of the Free Staters.
so it is impossible to see into it properly. It can be approached
only over bare open slopes, and the ridges held by Warren are
so steep that guns cannot be placed on them. But we are shell
ing the enemy's position with our howitzers and field artillery,
placed on lower ground behind infantry.
"The enemy is replying with Creusot and other artillery.
In this duel the advantage rests with us, as we appear to be
searching his trenches, and his artillery fire is not causing us
much loss.
Continued .on Seventh Page.
Political considerations, both foreign
and domestic, press upon the milltaryau
thcrlties the necessity for speedily accom
plishing something. These authorities
may have been persuaded to urge General
Buller to attempt his great operation
without adequate' preparation. This im
pression, whether true or not, is abroad. '
Apparently Lord Roberts has nothing
whatever . to,, do with General Buller's
operation. General Buller and the War !
CfHce communicate with each other di-Â«
rect. Buller's scheme was conceived be
fore Lord Roberts arrived at Cape Town
and .its execution was begun on the day
he landed. - The fact that the judgment
of Lord Roberts has not been brought to
bear upon the movement does not add to
public confidence.
The Times, commenting editorially upon
General Buller's dispatch, says:
"It. can but tend to Increase the severe
strain from which the nation Is suffering.
We must await the result of his attempt
to;seize the formidable Boer position with
courage and cooiness. Hlb success may
be decisive, but the danger of the attempt
is evidently great. The intense excite
ment of the besieged in Ladysmith may
be imagined.
"General Warren is moving with com
mendable. Indeed imperative caution, but
it must not be forgotten that delay, how
ever caused, must tell in many respects
in favor of the enemy. The Boers have,
it is true, fallen back when hard pressed,
but they have gained time to bring up
men, guns, ammunition and supplies to
the position they have selected for their
principal stand and to intrench it in
thorough fashion, the fashion they under
stand so well. Until that position has
been taken and its defenders routed and
badly cut up the relief of Ladysmith can
not be considered here."
From Vienna comes the statement that
contingency that will cause the United
States to change its policy will be an in
timation from Great. Britain that it is de
sirous of the employment of the good of
fices of this Government, and no tntim.i
tion of this character is expected in vi^w
of the present temper of the British people.
Evidently there has been a radical char.iÂ£f>
in Mr. Whites- plans. It was stated on
Sunday by a person close to him that he
would see the President on the following
day. White did uot. however, appear at
the White House. When he called on
Secretary Hay to-day, I am reliably in
formed, he opened the conversation by as
suring the Secretary that he presented
no credentials, that he did not seel; rec
ognition as a diplomatic agent of the Boer
Government and that he was here for the
purpose of looking out for Its interests in
simply a private capacity. He then bÂ«
gan a statement of the causes of the war
and conditions existing in the Transvaal.
Because of the valuable information he
was able to give Secretary Hay the latter
was very glad to listen to, what Mr. Whltft
had to say, and the two remained closeted
for nearly a half-hour. ;
When The Call correspondent saw Mr.
White to-night he confirmed the fact that
he had been courteously received by the
Sacretary of State, but refused to further
discuss the matter. I understand, hew
ever, that Mr. White is very much grati
fied at his reception and the. willingness
displayed by Mr." Hay to listen to the
statement he made. It is expected hÂ«
will remain in Washington looking out for
the interests of his, Government... He has
not presented credentials, though it la
possible he may do so, but in any event
he will look out for^ the''Transvaal inter-
ARTILLERY FIRE THE
HEAVIEST IN THE WAR
LONDON, Jan. 24â After a most anx
love day for the entire Britis-h na
tion, frorr. laborer to Cabinet Mm- |
istcr. the War Office this morning
at 2:13 o'clock gave out a dispatch '
Â¦ from O^irral Bulger which. ITr.oti
Â¦what had been hoped and prayed for. was j
net wlt^t had been feared since the veil]
of silence fell upon the field of battle j
Monday. General Warren, it appears, has
not been able to make much progress
*:nce that day, owing to the strength of
the Boers' Intrencbtnents, but had suc
ceeded in holding the ground which he
had won. Evidently his position is peril
ous, for Genera! Buller, telegraphing at
6:20 o'clock yesterday afternoon, tiatcd
that an. attack upon SpJon Kop. the ctn
ter of the Boer position, would be made
that night. By this time, if Sir Redyers'
Intention was carried out. the attack has
been made, and the British have cither ]
struck the decisive blow for the relief of
Ladysrnith or r.av*-, as was tlie rase wit fa
their previous night attacks, been forced
back by a rifle blast irom the Boer
trenches.
Tbe lons silence and admission that i
General Warren had been unable to gain
further by methods employed dur
ing the four days' previous fighting, and !
th.it he had not been able to advance for |
two days. nV. Indicate that General Bui- j
U r had determined to make a night attack i
as a desperate resort.
Before mi<inight rumors flew thick and
fast. A great crowd gathered at the War j
Office, only to be icld there vas no Intel- !
licence to impart. Mr. Balfour was one l
ci the c&H^rs.
Reports during the afternoon, which up- j
ee-t ihe Stock Exchange, to the effect that :
Warren had been defeated and had lost !
two battalions as prisoners, while not be- j
lievfd. had a marked effect upon the
nerves of the public General Bu'ler's
long sjlence still further incre-ased the j
gleon No cewÂ« could not have beer,
thought goo 3 news in this case, for tho !
reason that when General Buyer's ad- j
v;. r.ce was progressing favorably for the j
British arms there was plenty of news.
When London will know the result of |
the night attack will depend largely upon ;
â¢whether the British' are successful. If
victorious. General Buiier is not likely to
lose much time in notifying the Govern
ment, and news fbould reach here some
tirre this morning. If he be thrown back,
there is no telling how many hours may
clapÂ»e
As to the fighting, all the intelligence
received In London yesterday came
through Boer sources. From the Boer
laager before Ladysmith came Ihe in
formation that ther" had been engage
ments on Ollviers Hock road, between
Pretoria! and a British force estimated
at COOO men. and that brisk fighting had
been going on at Spion Kop, whither
Gentrals Botha and Cronje have pre
ceded.
The road to Oliviers Hock Pass runs
through Acton Homes, so that the earlier
part of the message refers to the action
Of Saturday, but reference to a battle at
Epion Kop would indicate that on Mon
day the central point of the enemy's
position was as?a.ik-d.
from General Buller's dispatch General
Warren on Tuesday was holding the
Eame position as that which he gained
in the two days previous, so Jhat if an
attack was rr.ade on Monday it must
have failed. It was General Warren's
original intention to make a wide de
tour from Trichards Drift westward, but
the progress of his left wing was stopped
on reaching the ridge running down trom
Bpfob Kop toward Acton Homes, which ,
was strongly intrenched by the Boers.
As it would have been Impossible to se
cure communication and transport past
this obstacle, the general returned to j
Trichards Drift on Saturday and began j
his series of engagements.
NEW YORK. Jan. 21.â A special to the
â¢Sun from Pretoria, dated Jan. 22, via
Lourenzo Marques, says: Heavy fighting
was reported en Saturday for twelve
miles along the Tugela River. The Brit
jt-h artillery fire, was the heaviest that has
been experienced during the war. It is
estimated that over 30,000 troops were en
paged in an assault on the Tugela
heights, which are occupied by the Boers.
The iigir.ir.g front extended for twenty
three miles. The artillery fire met with
no response from the Boers until the in
fantry attacked their position. The Brit
ish made thrre assaults and were each
time vigorously repelled. The Boer gen
erals were Hans Botha. Schalkburger
and Lucas Meyer. The British cannon,
! numbering over forty, maintained a
i frightful concentrated fire. Every time
j the British stormed the Boer position
| they were reinforced by fresh divisions,
I but their efforts were useless.
Yesterday the hostilities ceased, and the
I British ambulances were busy for ten
I hours picking up and attending to the
I wounded on the field of action.
The garrison at Ladysmith attempted
to make a demonstration, but the Beer
crutpo.ns gave the alarm and the attempt
Tias prevented. To-day everything around
tht beleaguered city is quiet.
On Saturday night the British garrison
at Ladysmith sent up a dozen rockets
showing a blue light. These were prob
ably signals to General Buller's relief col
: um:i, which is fighting south of the
j Tugela River.
Commandant General Joubert has just
celebrated his sixty-seventh birthday.
Mr. Adalbert Hay. the nuwly appointed
American Consul, has advised the â¢ Gov
ernment that he will reach Delagoa
Bay during the current week.
CHEERING NEWS WANTED
BEFORE PARLIAMENT MEETS
LONDON, Jan. 24.â The Morning Post
and the Standard touch lightly upon the
unpleasant features of Euller's dispatch
and take hope from the projected night
attack, but all together considered the
dispatch looks like preparation for worse
news. .â¢
According to General Buller the Boer'
position Is rather more elevated than his,
about three-quarters of a mile oft.
British infantry could not advance in
daylight over the op*n elope. To Gen
eral Warren it looked like an impasse,
bo General Buller determined to make a
bold attempt to take Spion Kop. the j
salient angle of the Boer ground, com- j
manding it for some distance. If
achieved. It will not even then mean a
rapid walk to Ladymith. There are at
Parliament will meet In five days. The
Cabinet has been hoping for one rallying
British success to cheer the country and
to command, generous support for fresh
revenue measures. Among these will be
probably an increase of the Income a
shilling to the pound, but this would only
provide the cost of five weeks' hostilities.
The duties on tobacco, alcohol, tea and
coffee are likely to be raised. â¢
. The Cabinet will meet at the end of the
week and discuss the situation. /;._.;Â«â¢.
WATCHING FOR THE
SENATORIAL
LIGHTNING.
JBgJ^ EADERS throughout the city
jgjgi and State will observe that The
MjjP^ Call was right when It declared
that Governor Gage would call
ly an extra session of the Legis
lature. The Governor's real
design was never concealed by
a veil of mystery. According to the proc
lamation the members will assemble at
Sacramento next Monday. "When they
wll! adjourn no one can foretell. :
Judge Dibble, who Is the recognized
leader of the Burns faction In the Assem
bly, expressed the opinion yesterday that
the work outlined In the Governor's call
coujd easily be accomplished In two
weeks. It is his Judgment that the sire
die adjournment of the Legislature will
take place before the middle of February.
Other members expect a longer session,
holding that the work cut out cannot be
completed Inside of thirty days.
The Senatorial contest reopens with sev
eral candidates in the field. General W.
H. L. Barnes will not re-establish head
quarters at Sacramento, but his support
ers insist that his chances of success have
increased since the adjournment of the
regular session and that he must not
think of retiring from the struggle.
Irving M. Scott will reopen headquar
ters in the Golden Eagle Hotel. It Is v.o
longer a secret that U. S. Grant's former
managers. Milton Green and Jim">3
Brown, are actively supporting Mr. Scott.
Ex-Mayor L. R. Ellert is not Idle or in
different. In the Senate John F. Davi* of
Aoador and in the Assembly F. E. Dun
lap of San Joaquin will uphold the cau<3e
of the shipbuilder.
Mr. Scott authorizes the statement th.*t
he is a candidates He offers no objection
to an open caucus of all the Republican
members of the Legislature. He will ob
ject, however, to any plan or scheme for
secret balloting.
D. M. Burns is still in the field as a
candidate, but the cry of "Burns or no
Senator" is hushed. His advocates say:
"Colonel Burns is willing to go into cau
cus and take hia chances with other can
didates." Confidence in Burns' ability to
win may exist, but there is no open boast
ing of his success, on the quiet the stoo
ls circulated that Gage did not call tho
session until Herrin and Burns were con
vinced that they could swing forty-three
votes in caucus.
The Call's information is that Burns
cannot increase his original following of
thirty, yet the fact is well known to this
journal that Burns men on the quiet are
circulating the report that Dickinson,
Morehouse, Cutter. De Lancie, Merritt.
Iluber and Raw can be lined up for tha
colonel when they are needed.
The Influence of the Republican State
Central Committee will not be cast in
Burns" favor at the extra session. Execu
tive patronage has been distributed and
therefore cannot be held out to reward
the supporters of Colonel Burns. The
enactment of Gage's proposed legislation
giving the executive authority to remove
appointees would open the patronage
pasture, but members of the Legislature
will Investigate this measure before com
mitting themselves to It.
Folltlcal gossip is to the effect that
Burns is to have a new manager. M. R.
Higgins says that he cannot accept the
position. Major McLaughlin is not men
tioned as an available candidate for tha
job as he is handicapped by weight and
inability. It is said that Hervey Ltndley
ia out of favor and out of training. A re
port is current that Thomas Field of Mon
terey, a former representative of the Pa
cific Improvement Company, will handla
the reins for the colonel.
John A. Barham, member of CongreS3.
representing the First District, is a can
didate for United States Senator, but has
r.oc yet displayed any positive strength. In
the absence of a regularly accredited
manager, the Sonoma delegation, repre
senting both political parties, may look
after the Barham fences.
Assemblymen Raw. Arnerich. Eugene
Sullivan end Barry an,d Senator Hall
are serving their country on the water
front. Their names are Inscribed on
the payroll of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners. It is under
stood that each will apply for leave of
absence to attend the extra session. As
semblyman J. M. Hanley of San Fran
cisco has been appointed to the lucrative
position of deputy District Attorney under
the new charter, and therefore cannot at
tend the session. If his resignation ha*
not been forwarded to Speaker Anderson
It ought to go by the next mail.
Dr. Marvin. Assemblyman from Hum*
boldt County, is holding down a place m
the medical department of Agnews Asy
lum for tne Insane. He may visit Sacra
mento, but the story goes that he ia not
inclined to extend his northerly Journey
to Humboldt County.
The story is again told that no money
will be expended by Huntlngton and Her
rin to promote the election of Burns. In
ileu of cash each new supporter of tha
colonel will receive a chromo of Wright,
Simpson, Jllson and Cospex.
WHY THE GOVERNOR
CALLED THE
EXTRA SESSION
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.
STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 23. 1000.
in AKEREAS, an extraordinary
AP /f\ no occasion exists, requiring the
Â£1 M Â¥3 convening of the Legislature
JsJLjUr J& of the State of California for
Xjjg&kgSr the purposes hereinafter par
. ticularly eet forth:
Now. therefore. I, Hanry T.
Gage. Tis Governor; by virtue of tSw. power
conferred upon me by section 9, article V.
of the constitution of the State of Califor
nia, do . hereby convene the said Legisla
ture, to assemble in extraordinary session
at the city of Sacramento. State aforesaid,
at the State Capitol, on Monday, the
twenty-ninth (2Sth) day of January, in
the year of our Lord 1900, at 1 o'clock p.
m. of said day.
The purposes for which I have by this
proclamation convened and for which I
do hereby convene said Legislature to
meet . in said session are specifically as
follows:.
Firstâ To elect a United States Senator
from this State to fill the vacancy now
existing, caused by the expiration of the
term of oince of Hon. Stephen M. White.
Secondâ To consider and enact a law to
take immediate effect, amending section
2524 of the Political Code of the State of
California.
HARBOR FRONT DEFINED.
In delineating 1 officially the meandering
line of the city's water front the Gov
ernor makes no material pnangre. The
limits are those lai'i down in the old law.
The description, as contained In both the
law and the message, is as follows:
Section 2324. The Commissioners shall
have por.sPF.slon and control of that por
tion of the bay of San Francisco, together
with ail the impro\ ements, rights, privi
leges, casements, appurtenances connect
ed therewith or In any way appertaining
United States.
In the call the Governor has given to the Legislature latitude enough to make the ses
sion as long as the discretion of the legislators may dictate. The people of the State may pay for
a meeting of two weeks or two months. They may discuss the possibility of the reform
of State institutions, but will still have the grim satisfaction of knowing that the Governor of
this State is expending their money in an effort to make his political creator an ornament of the
United States Senate.
GOVERNOR GAGE has called an extra session of the Legislature to convene next Mon
day at noon. His Excellency, in explanation of his announcement, gives sixteen reasons
why the session should be called and the people of the State should be made to endure the
expense of the session. These sixteen reasons, as The Call has announced time after time, may
be reduced to one. Governoi Gage wishes to pay his political debts, and he has convened the
Legislature in extraordinary session for the simple purpose of electing Dan Burns a Senator of
the United States if it is possible to make enough members of the State Legislature untrue to
their trust as public officers.
In the proclamation which announces the extra session of the Legislature the Governor
declares that a United States Senator shall be elected. He says that the State laws governing
the water front of San Francisco need reform; that the laws governing schools and lunacy asy
lums require amendment. His sixteen reasons for the call for an extraordinary session must in
evitably be reduced to one, which is the desire to make his Mexican master a Senator of the
Sixteen Reasons Are Given for the Call, but They All Reduce
Themselves to the Single Purpose of Electing Dan
Burns to the United States Senate.
LONDON, Jan. 24, 2:15 a. m. â Contrary to the announce
ment made shortly before midnight by the War Office
that nothing further would be issued until Wednesday
forenoon, the following dispatch from General Buller, dated
Spearmans Camp, January 23, 6:20 p. m., has just been posted:
"Warren holds the position he gained two days ago. In
front of him, at about 1400 yards, is the enemy's position, west
of Spion Kop. It is on higher ground than Warren's position,

TEXAS LEGISLATURE
IN EXTRA SESSION
Convened to Consider the Proposed
Eevision of the State's Tax
System.
AUSTIN. Texas, Jan. tl.â The Texas
Legislature was convened In special ses
sion to-day for the consideration of the
proposition from the Tax Commission,
created at the last session, to revise the
entire taxation system of the State. The
Governor's message, explanatory of the
proposed bill, was submitted soon after
the two houses met to-day and after its
reading the Legislature adjourned until
to-morrow, when the active consideration
of the proposed taxation law will be be
gun.
This measure Is far-reaching, being
termed a dragnet that will greatly In
crease corporation and personal property
taxes, and Is in many instances so dras
tic that it has. occasioned much opposi
tion. In fact, a poll of the Legislature
shows that many of the members are op
posed to the bill and there promises to be
a lively and long fight.
The corporations suffer severely in the
levy of taxes under this proposed law
and the taxation of mortgages and notes
as contemplated in the bill will occasion
a fight from a large portion, of the
wealthy people of the State as well as
the banking interests.

the deal. He had never had any auÂ«
thority to dispose of Woods' vote. In one
of his letters ho had referred to some one
as an "incubus."
"To whom did you refer?" asked F&ulk
ner.
"To Marcus Daly," came the reply
promptly.
In another letter he expressed the
opinion that it was Important that Clarlc
should see Woods first, but he said that
his purpose in this was simply to "brtns
Clark to time."
In reply to a question as to whether he
had been promised anything for comlnff
to Washington to testify In this case
Ector said that Receiver Ranft of the
Missoula Land Ofllce had advanced him
$100 taking an order upon the committee.
"In one of your letters you speak of
having received an offer of $5000 from the
opposition to Clark." said Birney on re
direct examination. "Was that a fact?"
"No. sir." responded the witness; "that
was a bluff."
Ector was then excused, and the com
mittee took a recess until 3 o'clock.
State Senator J. R. McKay. Republican,
from Custer County. Montana, said he
was one of the four Republicans of the
Legislature who had refused to vote for
Clark. He said the announcement of the
intention of the Republicans to change
their votes to Clark was not made unul
the last Republican caucus previous to
the election of United States Senator.
There was very little *ald at this caucus,
and after the ten men withdrew the four
remained, deciding to continue to vote for
a Repuhllcan. Ho had been approached
once or twice and asked to vote for Clark.
Among those who had come to see him
was Senator Phillips, who said he <*ould
get $1.">.00<) for his vote. He had declined
to enter Into an agreement of the kind.
The next witness was B. J. Fln*>. a
Democratic member of the Legis.attirÂ©
from Madison County, who said he had
been a friend of Senator Clark for many
years and had been one of his active sui>
porters In the campaign for the Senate.
Campbell subjected the witness to a
searching investigation. He first inquired
as to Fine's financial condition prior to
the election. He had had enough to HvÂ«Â»
on and thousrht his cash amounted to>
about $300 or 1500. Mis business was then,
as now. that of a mining operator. Upon
starting to Helena to attend the session
of the legislature ho had deposited $330
or J-KX* for his daughter. He had since
that time deposited more money In the
bank, putting in $2000 in June, but It waa
not true Pollard held a certificate for J3259
belonging to him. Fine said that he had
received the J2OOO which he had deposited
In June from the bank of W. A. Clark,
and had taken It from Butte at the In
stance of AVellcome. This was part pay
ment for services and expenses In worlc
he was doing for Clark on an arrang*
ment made with the Senator soon after
the latter's election. On this business, he
said, he was still employed, fie had ever
since then been engaged In working fv>r
the disbarment of Senator .W. A. Clarlc
of Madison County. He had been engaged
to do this work by Senator Clark him
self, but no specific compensation had
been agreed upon. Since getting th* $2000
he had received about $3000 more, making
$.">OOO in all. Since the meeting of the Leg
islature he had not received any money
from any other source than Clerk. Ha
had never rendered any account to Clarlc
nor kept a memorandum book, but had
kept the whole matter in his memory.
THE STEAMER TOWNSEND.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 23.â News of the wreck of the steamer Townsend near
Haines Mission, Alaska, January 16, was brought by the steamer Cottage City,
which arrived to-day. The Townsend was on her way from Â» Juneau to Haines
Mission when one of her steam valves gave out and weakened the machinery
to such an extent that she was soon drifting helplessly. A heavy wind was blow
ing and soon threw her stern first on the rocks at Rocky Point, midway be
tween Battery Point and Haines Mission. She was almost Immediately driven,
broadside on- the reef and began filling, .which caused her to list heavily to star
board. Captain McKenzie ordered a lifeboat lowered and sent the passengers
and part of the crew ashore, the officers remaining with the ship.
Ten minutes after striking the captain ordered Purser Carey below to sum
mon all hands on deck to abandon the ship, as from the position she was then oc
cupying It was feared that possibly she would take a heavy list to starboard
and roll completely over, sinking in sixty-two fathoms of water. In the mean
time a life line had been cast ashore and all the passengers and part of the crew
had landed safely. Twenty minutes after she struck she started to list so heav
ily that her keel was showing on the rocks on shore and the small boat was
pulled back to the ship to take the officers, including Captain McKenzie, who all
slid down the line from the vessel. Passengers and crew walked to Haines Mis
sion, and at last accounts the Townsend was still hanging to the rocks. The
steamer Is a total wreck.
The Townsend was brought from Portland two years ago to take a party of
prospectors to Alaska, but was damaged by fire and the project waa abandoned.
She ran between Seattle and Nome last fall â¢ and this winter has been plying
from here to Skaguay. She waa owned by Charles D. Lane of San Francisco.

tlefleld argued, could not be added to. If
they could and the House now excluded a
member because he was guilty of polyg
amous practices, next year It might ex
clude for adultery or because a member
was an attorney for a trust or an octopus
or for any other reason. The right of a
member to his seat was a constitutional
right. He took issue with the majority as
to the power of the House to expel a
member for acts committed before his en
trance into the Houee, citing case after
case in support of his contention. First,
he went back to the case of John Wilkes,
the famous English champion of free
speech, who was three times excluded and
twice expelled from the House of Com
mons, the second time for an act for
which he had been sent to prison five
years before. He quoted from various let
ters the denunciation of the damnable
doctrine that a single House of Parlia
ment could alter, suspend or abrogate the
law of the land. He went' back to the
constitutional debates to prove that Con
gress could not add to the qualifications
of members negatively stated In the con
stitution.
After depicting the conditions that
surrounded the framing of this provision
of the constitution and quoting the words
of Madison, Hamilton and Jefferson, he
asked triumphantly who there was who
could shatter the crucible of history
which surrounded It or the declaration
of the men who framed It. Who would
undertake to impeach the integrity of the
men who were present at the dawn of
our history.
Some of the precedents cited by Tayler
Â¦were ridiculed by Llttlefleld. He chal
lenged Tayler's authorities. Llttlefleld
said that the majority was driven back
to support Its contention for additional
qualifications upon the general welfare
clause of the constitution. He won the
first burst of applause while ridiculing
the attempt of the majority to dispose
of Justice Story's opinion by stating that
he had not sought to give his own ideas,
but only the ideas of others. They would,
said Littlefield, make him the "Boswell
of the constitution." (Great laughter.)
Littlefield said the minority stood with
Burke, the statesman of the eighteenth
century, with Jefferson, Madison, Hamil
ton, Morris and the men who framed the
constitution: with the decisions of the
courts of Maryland, Montana and Vir
ginia; with the opinions of Story, Cooley.
Cushing, John Randolph. Tucker and
Webster. He then challenged Tayler's
statement that no precedent existed
against exclusion, citing the case of Ben
jamin Stark in the Senate in 1862, who
was charged with disloyalty, yet who
was seated by the Senate without preju
dice to subsequent action against him.
The majority, he pointed out, had cited
this case, but had not informed the
House of this fact.
"I believe." said Littlefleld. concluding
his comment on this particular case,
"that Roberts has a full constitutional
right to a seat in this House."
The applause which swept over the
floor In response to this statement ex
tended to the galleries, many of the
ladles there participating.
The Whittemore case, which occurred
immediately after the war, Llttlefield said
was a poor precedent. The passions of
the war had not cooled and he believed
the action of the House In excluding
Whittemore at that time on the ground of
selling oadetshlps was : unwarranted and
ill advised. (
Littlefield attacked the proposition of
the majority that Roberts had violated
thÂ» compact between Utah and the United
States. He asked where the authority for
the statement that there was an under
standing between a State and the United
States came from. Eloquently he declared
that the idea of a compact between the
States had been the father of secession,
blotted out by the lives of a half million
men.
Llttlefleld's defense of the proposition
of the minority that the House had a
right to expel Roberts concluded his ar
gument. He aroused a great deal of en
thusiasm when he recalled the difficult
Eosltion In which ex-Speaker Reed had
een placed in the last Congress when
General Wheeler returned from the Span
ish war covered with laurels to resume
his seat In the House and the difficult
task of Speaker Henderson, then chair
man on Judiciary, who was obliged to re
port against General Wheeler. No mere
patriotic sentiment permitted them to
override the plain dictates of their duty.
Proceeding, he pointed out the unques
tioned right of either house to oxpel a
member for any cause deemed sufficient.
This power was unquestioned, and before
It was exercised Roberts should be sworn
in.
"We state upon our consciences and
oaths." said he, "that he should have the
full benefit of the fundamental law of the
land." (Loud applause.)
Llttlefield closed rather abruptly. Tay
ler then r?newed his request for an agree
ment for a vote at 4 o'clock on Thurs
day. Crumpacker of Indiana objected.
Upon the request of Tayler Roberts was
then given one and a half hours In which
to present his side of the case. He spoke
at first very low, but his voice soon rose
and he was at ease apparently.
The two arguments just presented, he
began, made It appear that there was a
difference of opinion as to the method of
procedure in the case of the member from
Utah. From his standpoint he could
agree with neither view presented.
"I find myself In a position," said he,
"where I might say with propriety 'A
plague on both your houses,' since both
propose my undoing (laughter), but," he
continued, "the situation Is not altogeth
er without Its advantages."
He was convinced with the minority
that the House had no right to exclude
him and with the majority that once ad
mitted he could not be expelled.
"Between the two," said he, "matters
fall out about as I would have them and
substantial Justice will be done." (Re
newed laughter.)
Roberts gave notice that he should ap
propriate the arguments of the majority
against expulsion and those of the minor
ity against exclusion. His constitutionaj
qualiiications were admitted by both the
majority and minority of the committee
and he declared that the members of the
House, if they had regard for the consti
tution of their country, would call him
back to the bar from which he had been
Improperly turned away. He warned the
House that nations fell because they de
parted from their traditions. If a nation
indulged In "constitutional Immorality"
It died as did the Individual who was
puilty of physical immorality. He be
seeched the House not to yield to the
clamor of unthinking people. What was
the emergency for this proposed depart
ure from the constitution? A man who
had married in the sanctity of the church
a plural of wives had been elected to Con
gress. The cry had gone up that the
American home was endangered and
these extraordinary proceedings had been
Inaugurated against him. He continued:
For a few moments I want to pay attention
to the nature of this crime, not with a view of
showing that the American people have not the
right to establish monogamy as a system of
marriage that shall prevail and not for the
purpose of defending polygamy either; for In
the early debate that took place with reference
to this case on the floor of the Mouse I then
declared that I was not here to represent polyg
amy nor to defend it. We have long ago
passed that stage and the thing Is out of the
realm of discussion. I do not wish my remarks
construed as a defense of polygamy, but do want
to call attention to the nature of this crime, in
order that we may ascertain whether It is so
awful In Its aspect as to warrant a more law
less act than polygamy Itself. In order to re
buke a man who has been elected to the House
of Representatives. Take the Jewish people,
who were made the repository of God's revela
tion* to humanity. Tou shall not find the crime
of polygamy referred to among that people as
of the character It Is described here In the re
port of the committee. Evidently it Is malum
prohlbltum. It Is not mala in Â»c. If It were
you would not find the Jewish law enforcing li
under some circumstances, regulatlng.lt under
other circumstances, and men after God's own
heart sustaining those relations which are now
WASHINGTON. Jan. 23.â This has been
an oratorical field day in the House over
the case of Brigham H. Roberts, the Mor
mon Representative from Utah. The gal
leries were packed to suffocation, chiefly
with women, and the spectators, after
listening attentively to the arguments of
Tayler of Ohio and Littlefield of Maine,
for the adoption of the majority and mi
nority reports, respectively, of the special
committee that investigated the case, re
mained long after nightfall to hear the
impassioned words of the accused as he
faced the House like an animal at bay,
knowing that every hand was raised
against him.
Roberts was very adroit In the handling
of his case and at times exceedingly dra
matic. Taking ' advantage of the issue
raised by the division In the committee as
to the method of ousting him, he appropri
ated to himself the argument of the mi
nority that he was constitutionally en
titled to be sworn 'in, and the argument
of the majority that, once sworn in, he
could not be expelled. He defended the
action of the Mormons in fighting the au
thority of the United States for years
because, he said, they believed that senti
ment would change; and he dramatically
declared that in those days he would
rather have his flesh hewn from his bones
than to have renounced his religious ten
ets. He concluded with an eloquent pero
ration, in which he said he had never been
conscious of a shameful act, and if he was
sent forth he would go with head erect
and undaunted brow.
Strange to say, most of the applause he
won was from women. But while they ap
peared to be his only partisans, the other
women manifested their bitter hostility by
hissing him at every opportunity.
The speech made to-day by Llttlefield,
who succeeds the late Mr. Dingley, in de
fense of the minority proposition to seat
and then expel Roberts, was a masterful
effort and stamped him as one of the com
ing men of the House. The manner In
which, he tore some of the arguments of
the majority to shreds jumped him into
the front rank of debaters in the House.
The speech made a deep impression. In
fact, it is predicted to-night by many
members that the majority resolutions
for exclusion cannot now carry.
Lacey of lowa has a proposition which
he will" submit, to expel Roberts by a two
thirds vote, without seating him, which
will have supporters, and this may lead
to a compromise proposition.
Miss Roberts, daughter of Roberts, was
in the reserved gallery throughout the de
bate to-day. The debate will close next
Thursday at 4:30.
Nearly every member was in his seat
when Tayler of Ohio, chairman of the
special committee which investigated the
case, arose from back of a desk stacked
high with legal authorities and manu
script and called the oast. Tayler asked
that the agreement between the majority
and minority of the committee for a vote
on the case'at 4:30 p. m. on Thursday be
ratified by the House. Lacey of lowa ob
jected unless It be understood that a sub
stitute resolution which he desired to of
fer te also considered pending. To this
Tayler objected. He also objected to hav
ing l^ncey's proposition read, although ap
pealed to by Bailey of Texas and Rich
ardson of Tennessee. This proposition, as
it subsequently developed, was for the ex
pulsion of Roberts without swearing him
In.
The majority resolutions to exclude
him and the minority resolutions to per
mit him to be sworn In and then ex
pelled were laid before the House without
any agreement as to a vote.
Tayler opened In support of the major-
lty resolutions. He spoke clearly and
with great earnestness. When he began
Roberts changed his position to one near
the center aisle on the Democratic side,
where he could hear with more ease. Tay
ler said:
Chief Justice Waite in the Reynolds case In
1576, speaking of the claim that polygamy was
a rellk'lous practice, said: Â¦Â¦ <\.
"To permit this would be in effect to permit
every citizen to become, a law unto himself.
Government could exist only In name under
such circumstances,'.' and Justice Matthews In
the Ramsey case in ISS4 declares in substance
that all political influence ought to be with
drawn from those who are practically hostile
to the establishment of a free, self-governing
commonwealth founded on thÂ» Idea of a family
as consisting In and springing from the union
of the life of one man and one woman In the
holy state of matrimony.
If we are to attach any Importance to these
fundamental declarations of the highest court
we most declare, no matter what moral ques
tion may be Involved, that this case presents In
bold relief a question of governmental life, the
basis of which Is law.
Of the more than 76.0iX>,000 American citizens
all but the merest handful believe, and be
lieve with a mighty fervor. In the kind of
commonwealth which Justice Matthews says Is
found In the marriage relation existing for life
between one man and one woman. That Idea
has been for many years crystallized in solemn
and deliberate law. whoso principle and form
have been approved by the highest Judicial
authority. Such laws make Imperative demand
for universal respect and obedience, and the
duty of such respect and obedience presses
most urgently upon a representative of a peo
ple In a law-making body.
These prooositions are fundamental and -lelf
evldent. They lie at the root of things. They
are the bedrock on which written constitutions
re*t; they precede constitutions; constitutions
assume their pre-exlstence and their perpetual
existence. They are institutional.
If the minority be right the framers of the
constitution. If they had foreseen the Roberts
incident with Its defiance of the constitution
and the law and its denial of their validity
and supremacy as to him, would have said
Brigham H. Roberts Is eligible, and must bo
seated If elected. I say that no such pro
vision could have been adopted, and If It could
not it cannot be Implied.
Much is said about the moral side of this
question. Doubtless it has such a side, and If
that were the only consideration before us the
House might take the same action it will take.
But I do not here and now in the face of the
groat fundamental fact of disobedience to law
plus audacious defiance of It care to assert the
moral eround. . . â¢/ -"â¢'Â¦'. .'Â¦Â¦â¢
If we do not exclude this man we strike
down one of the most vital and necessary pow
ers that belongs to a great legislative body.
Let no such thing- be done. If it is not we
may be sure that never again while the spirit
of civilization dominates this republic will any
defiant violator of law under cover of re
ligion or any other claim, whether polygamlst
or murderer, knock for admission at the do< r
of the American Congress.
Tayler was emphatic In his assertions
that exclusion was in harmony with pre
cedent; expulsion In violation of it. He
amplified the three grounds for Roberts'
exclusionâ lirst, because of his violation
of the Edmunds act; second, because he
was living in open, flagrant and notorious
violation of the statutes of the Congress
he seeks to enter; and, third, because his
election was a violation of the compact
by which Utah was admitted Into the
Union.
There were no demonstrations through
out Tayler's speech, but at the conclu
sion he was vigorously. applauded..
Llttlefleld of Maine, on oehalf of the
minority of the committee, then arose in
support of the minority's plan of seating
and then expelling Roberts. He recounted
at the outset the integrity, honesty and
ability of the majority of the committee,
but he could not concede Its Judgment.
The only issue between the majority and
minority was as to whether Roberts should
be excluded or expelled. The constitutional
qualiiications, age and inhabitancy, Llt-
WASHINGTON. Jan. 23.â Some of the
letters written by Dr. Ector, the Missoula
dentist, to Senator Clark of Montana,
which have been missing for a week or
ten days, have arrived and were to-day
presented to the Senate Committee on
Privileges and Elections In connection
with the investigation of the charges of
bribery made against Clark in his Sena
torial contest.
There were five or six letters addressed
to Blckford and four to Clark. All were
identified by Ector, who was again
placed on the stand. There were only two
letters dated prior to the November elec
tion of 1593. They related to the contest.
In these he stated that the opposition of
Woods, the candidate for the House that
he was supporting, was working "like
fury," and that the Clark men "need
some encouragement."
"To make a thorough canvass of the
2000 voters of the county requires the
stuff," he said, and added that he want
ed at least $500.
The next two letters, of riaie respective
ly November 17 and 21, Just after the
legislative election, referred to the ef
forts of Woods and the opposition to get
him. He told of Woods' debts and said
he had agreed to be bound by whatever
he did in the premises. The later letters,
from December 7. IS9B. to October 31, ISH9.
related almost entirely to Ector's efforts
to collect what he thought was due to
him for his efforts in Clark's behalf. In
December he wrote to Clark saying he
did not know to whom he must apply for
his dues.
"Of course," he said, "I am after what
there i 3 in it for me."
In March he wrote to Bickford asking
him about the 10 per centum of his (Blck
ford'sj receipts from Clark which he
(Ector) considered he was to have. It
was also In March that he wrote his sec
ond letter to Clark. In this letter he re
viewed at length his efforts in Clark's be
half, expressing his continued loyalty to
Clark and his determined opposition to
Dalyism.
"If you strike while the Iron Is hot," he
wrote, "you can stampede the Irish
king."
He said In this letter that two of Daly's
men had promised 15000 to him during the
Senatorial contest for information as to
Clark's movements, but he had refused to
entertain the offer.
The last letter of the series was dated
October 31 last, and v/as addressed to
Clark. In this letter he asked if he was
to expect anything. In the letters he
pleaded povertj" and debt as the controll
ing reason for the pressure he was try-
Ing to bring to bear upon Clark.
On cross-examination Ector said that
Woods had been an original Clark man
and that he . probably would have re
mained so unless corrupt means were
used on the other side. He had thought
it possible that Woods might be con
trolled by getting possession of the mort
gage.
"I told Blckford that the best plan was
to pay off the mortgage and then he
would have strings on Woods and thus
have him solid."
He had told Woods that he could get
enough money out of Clark to pay his
debts, but he had declined to enter Into

TWO REPORTS SUBMITTED
IN THE CASE OF QUAY
Majority Declares Against and the
Minority in Favor of Seating
the Pennsylvanian.
Special Dispatch to Tie Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan.
23â The Quay case is now formally before the Senate, bcth the majority and
minority reports of .the committees having btcn presented to-day. The ma
jority report holds that Quay is not entitled to a t>eai. It is signed by Sena
tors Ca.ff.rey, Pettus. Turley, Harris and Burrows. The opposite view is taken
by Senators Hoar, Chandler, Pritchard and McComas, all of whom are per-
Eor.ai friends of the PennsylvarJan.
The Call correspondent was to-day reliably informed by a member of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections that the probability that Governor
Gage might appoint Colonel Burns Senator from California in case Quay
were seated was a week or ten days agx> the subject of animated discussion in.
the committee-room while the deliberations were being secretly conducted. A
Democratic member cf the committee was equipped with copies of the San
Francisco Call and the Philadelphia North American, showing the character
cf the man who would be appointed from California if Quay were seated. It
is understood that Senator Hoar, chairman of the committee, was Inclined to
rule this argument out of order as being totally irrelevant. It was. generally
conceded around the board that it would be a. calamity If a man like Burns
wero appointed, but that this fear 6hou!d not influence Senators In deciding
the case cf Mr. Quay on its individual merits.
A Republican member of the committee quoted the constitution of the
United States and argued that each house of Congress was the sole judge of
the Qualifications of its members. It was pointed out that, although Roberts
via duly elected from Utah as Representative in Congress, the House had
decided not to allow him to take the oath of office, and a special committee
had reported In favor of rejecting him on the ground that he was morally
disqualified. This member of the Senate Committee said that, although he
wouid_yote to seat Mr. Quay, he would not regard this as a precedent. He
declared" thai, having voted for Quay, he would not feel bound to vote for the
admission cf Burns. Indeed, if after an investigation of the newspaper al
legations it were found that Burns' character was as bad as represented he
would vote against him on the ground that he, like Roberts, was morally
onfit.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 23.â The reports of
the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions In the case of M. S. Quay, who
claims a seat in the United States Senate
on the strength of an appointment from
the Governor of Pennsylvania, were pre
sented in the Senate to-day. A majority
report, opposing the sealing of Quay, was
eigned by Ca.ff.ery, Pettus, Turley, Har
ris and Burrows, the last named being
;he only Republican sigr.ing it. The min
ority report bears the signatures of Hoar.
Chandler. Prttchard and McComas, all
Republican*, arid advocates giving the
teat to Quay.
The majority report first rtiiews the
circumstances under which Quay's ap
pointment was made. Including the fail
ure of the Pennsylvania Legislature to
elect a Senator. It then says:
After a vacancy in the office of United States
Sma: -r occurs cr comes to pass. If the next
I>g;flature does not fill It. it continues to ex
ist. It is the same vacancy, not a new one.
New. the State ex>vutive is given power to
make a temporary appointment in case of a
vacancyâ ;,<_t as long as it continues or exists,
but only until the next meeting of the Legis
lature, wliieb is then required to fill the va
cancy. This clearly means that the paramount
ir.unt to have the Legislature choose the Sen
ators Is to prevail, and that whenever the Leg
islature hat had the opportunity to fill the va
cancy, either beiort or after it occurs, the ex
ecutive lias no power to appoint. And when
we take the rhrase "if vacancies hapi#n by
resignation cr otherwise during the recess of
the Legislature of any State." If we concede
that the general word "otherwise" Is not qual
ified or limited by the specific word Â¦"resigna
tion." and that it includes vacancies which are
ccui-e/J f>- efflux of time, and which can be
i ore*eÂ« n as Â»Â»ll as vacancies which are caiisM
bjr a casualty cr the happening of an unexpect
ed event, and which cannot be foreseen, still it
must t*Â» oofwtraad and defined with reference
to tfa* balance of the chrase, so as to give vf
fe<-t. to all its pans; and it thus retuits that
the vacancy, no matter how it is produced.
must hai-pen. take place cr l*?gin during a rÂ«Â»
ress of the Legislature; and this <rf itself would
be decisive acainst Mr. Quay's claim.
Continuing, the report says
Thus construed, this clause cf the constitu
tion affords every facility for always keeping
the Senate filled with Ser.ators who are the real
representatives of their respective States. A
Pfr.ator who !s chosen by the Legislature cf his
Ftate is likely to be the choice of the majority
of the citizens cf his State. A Senator who
lc appointed by an executive is frequently only
the personal or political favorite of the execu
tive.
The Legislature, as we construe the clause,
chooses the Senator in the first instance. If
fee declines to serve or dies before he is In
ducted into office, or tf. after qualifying, he
dies, resigns cr is expelled, the executive may
tcake a temporary appointment until the Legis
lature meets again, or. if owing to changes in
Plate constitutions, the Legislature, which is
authorized to fill the tÂ»rm at its commence
ment, cannot meet until after the term com
menced, the executive can also make a tem
porary appointment.
Every contingency is thus provided for ex
cept the sole contingency' that the Leglp'.ature
will fall to perform its sworn duty. Against
a contingency- of this kind the framers of the
constitution did not intend to provide.
After discussing at !<>njrth the circum
stances under which the constitution was
framed, the majority announces its con
clusion as follows:
VTe think that the framers of the constitution
never contemplated nor intended to proi-ide for
a case where a State, by its own deliberate
tct. should deprive Its Legislature of the power
to fill an entire term at Its beginning. In our
opinion they never Intended to give the execu
tive of a State the power to fill an entire term
by original appolr.tmer.t. unless, posslb'.y. In
a case where the Legislature had chosen, and
On another point the minority says:
It is said that if th<? Legislature has been In
session after a vacancy and has failed to fill
it the State is in fault; that the Legislature
has nerlected its duty, and so it is not unjust
that the State should suffer. There are two
answers to this argument: First, that it is
for the interest of the whole people that every
State should be fully represented; and, sec
ond, that there is no fault to be Imputed to
the Legislature of a State or to the people
where a majority vote is required, if there be
a failure to elect. Will anybody claim that
the cast of a failure to elect a President for
want of a constitutional majority, a case pro
vided for by conferring a power upon the
House of Representatives voting by States, is
the case of fault or negligence on the part of
the j>eople?
The minority then gives considerable
attention to the various cases and con
cludes as follows:
The caw of Allen of Washington was de
cided with the LeÂ«Â», Mantle case and without
anriment. a decision to which Mr. Beckwith
of Wyoming submitted without further con
test. At that time there wae an earnest di
vision in the Senate on an important question
relating to the currency. 'which created for the
time being more earnest differences of opinion
than those existing between the two great po
litical parties on other questions. It was a
time not favorable- to a dispassionate, non
partisan Judgment. We prefer the authority
of the New Hampshire case, which was acted
on Â»iÂ»o in the case of Mr. Pasco of Florida,
and we thr.ik that a decision which must In
evitably deprive States In the Union for lonsr
periods of time of their rightful representa
tion under the constitution will not be per
mitted long to stand, and that no settlement
of the question In derogation of the rights of
the States and, as we conceive, in violation of
the Intent of the framers of the constitution,
enould be acquiesced In.
the person elected had refused to accept be
fore qualification. In other words, we con
clude that the power of appointment was not
to be exercised unless the vacancy occurred in
the recess of the Legislature and was occa
sioned by some casualty like death or resig
nation.
The report then quotes numerous pre
cedents, beginning with that of Kensey
Johns of Delaware in 1794 and closing
with the case of Henry W. Corbett of Or
egon in l&te. It then ends as follows:
The statement of these cases and precedents
shows that from the beginning of the Govern
ment to the present time the Senate has never
recognized the right of a State executive to
make a temporary appointment where the va
cancy happened or occurred during a session of
the Legislature. It shows, further, that for
seventy-five years the Senate has refused to
recognize the right of a State executive to
make a temporary appointment, even where
the vacancy happened or occurred durinc a
recess of the Legislature, if the Legislature
either bofore or after It occurred and prior to
thÂ» date of the appointment Jiad had an oppor
tunity to fill it.
Tfte fundamental principle thus established is
that if thÂ» Legislature, either before or after
the happening of a vacancy, has had an oppor
tunity to nil it, then there is> no power in the
State executive to appoint. The result is fatal
to the claims of Mr. Quay. No danger or evil
has resulted to the Government fruin the en
forcement of this principle.
We therefore submit that the Senate, for its
own honur and dignity, should stand by Its pre
vious solemn and deliberate decisions.
The minority report lakes the opposite
view. Quoting section 3. article 1, of the
constitution, the minority say that the
failure of the Governor to call the Leg
islature together to elect a Senator does
not act to deprive the Governor of the
power of appointment. Referring to the
constitutional provision the question is
asked:
Does thÂ» language of the constitution of the
United States mean Just what the constitution
of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania says:
"'ln ra?o of a vacancy in the office of United
States Senator in a recess between sessions,"
cr does it mean that the vacancy must be one
which comes by chance, so that it does not ap
ply at all to the case of a vacancy at the be
ginning of a term, which does not come by
chance but is foreseen and inevitable?
This question is answered as follows:
If the words have the former meaning then
all distinctions between cases where a Legis
lature has been in session and those where a
Legislature has not been in session between
vacancies at the beginning of a term and va
cancies beginning alter the term Itself has be
gun and the office for that term once filled,
are without importance. We think that the
former is the true meaning of the constitution.
We think that it was the intent of the consti
tution to provide, as far as possible, that every
State should have two Senators.
Firstâ The Constitutional Convention hesitat
ed between conferring the power of appointing
Senators upon the executive and the Legislature
of the State in the beginning. Like the Legis
lature, the executive of the State was puppoF-Â»U
to represent the will of the people. Under the
constitution then existing he appointed all
Stale officers and appointed Judges who held
tl'eir cfflrvÂ» for life, for there Is no reason to
suppose that they considered the executive an
unfit Instrument for such appointment, and
they settled the question by giving the power
of "permanent appointment to the Legislature
and of temporary appointment to the executive.
Secondâ We can conceive no reason likely to
have influenced the framers of the constitution
for maklne a distinction between cases of va
cancy occurring in one way or at one time and
vacancies occurring: in any other way or at any
other time. The office of Senator may be at
any time of Infinite Importance to the Interests
of a State. IJoon a slnzle vote may often de
pend, and Fomftlmes has depended, the fate of
measures which would brin* prosperity or mis
ery into every workshop and almost every fam
ily in Pennsylvania. We do not believe that
when the constitution was enacted it would
have occurred to anybody that if a Senator
died within a week of the adjournment of the
Legislature, or at a time when there were three
parties in the Legislature who could not agree,
or a time when the two houses who formerly
made an election by concurrent vote were of
ways of thinking In politics 50- different that
they could net be reconciled, the State must re
main unrepresented until a new Legislature
should bÂ« choeen.
They mennt. as we believe, that for the In
terest of the State and for the Interest of the
whole country the Senate should always be full,
t-o far j>s they could devise a constitutional
mechanism to accomplish that purpose. â¢
The language of the very clause In question
cannot be construed as the opponents of Mr.
Quay would construe ft. or In any other way
than the undersigned construe It. without de
siroyir.g its twn purpose. If there be no power
In the executive of Pennsylvania to appoint
a euorcssor to Mr. Quay under thle clause of
the constitution. there Is no power In the Legis
lature to choose such successor until the end
of the term: and In every case where a Senator
dies or resigns, where the Legislature is not In
session, or where after such death of resigna
tion, the Locislature has been and adjourned
without a choice, or wherever, at the beginning
of a term, the vacancy remains unfilled, It must
remain unfilled until the end of the six years,

committee.

birds that scattered in the open fields and
garden a short distance from the house.
The first brace- down on the new bevy

work was done on single birds, the only
point being made by Gem, which Pluto

SAD MEETING OF
FATHER AND HIS SON
Latter Finds the Former, After a
Long Separation, Insane in a
City Prison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SPOKANE, Wash., Jan. 23.â Frank C.
Buckley, a young railroad man of West
Superior, Wis., to-day discovered his
father In ttie Spokane County Jail, Insane
and serving a sentence for petty larceny.
The father, Thomas Buckley, was until
recently, a prominent lumber merchant at
West Superior, but through business re
verses lostali his property.. Three months
ago, when the father started West, he
was apparently In average health, but
brooding over his troubles drove him in
sane. Now he cannot recognize his old
friends and has forgotten nearly all his
former life. On arrival here he stole a
pair of blankets from the sleeping car
and when arrested told the officers he did
it to get even for being overcharged in
the diner. He was sent to jail and when
liberated again stole blankets and was
jailed. On the advice of local physicians
the son to-day secured his father's ad
mission to the State Insane Asylum. It
is thought that with care the patient may
recover his reason. The father Is 52 years
old and his son says he is totally changed
In manner of speech, actions and habits
but there is no doubt about his identity'
Frank Buckley is ticket agent at the
Union depot at West Superior. He leaves
for home to-morrow.

and Woodcraft would run for first and
second place. The ground selected for the
last heat was in the open iields. near
where the first brace had been put down
In the morning, and it was not long until
birds were located. Each of the puppi-es
did very creditable work. They were down
less than a half-hour when the judge
called them up, thus ending the heat and
the Derby. His decision was as follows:
AValter S. Hobart's b. and w. Entclish setter
Crocker Chief (Iroquois Chief-Mary Ix>u), first.
Gardiner & Betten's o. and w. English setter
Woodcraft (Count Gladstone IV-Suver G), sec
ond.
Stockdale Kennels' b!k. and t. pointer Cuba's
Zep (Cuba of Kenwood-Jaqulna), third.
The winner of the Derby is a handsome
stylish-looking clog. carrying a good head
and showing considerable intelligence in
working his ground for a dog of his age.
He Is but fourteen months old, and with
another year's training gives promise of
doing excellent work should he be entered
In the all-age.
Woodcraft also is a stylish mover, and
with more experience will develop into a
remarkably good dog. Cuba's Zep Is a
dog of remarkable speed, and for a puppy
does excellent work, although he seemed
to be sadly off In nose during the two
days' running. He ranges well and shows
considerable judgment for a puppy one
year old.
Entries for the all-age stake, which will
be run to-morrow, are as follows:
English settersâ C. B. Dwyer's b. b. dog Ta

PROMISING CANDIDATES FOR FIELD TRIAL HONORS.
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 23.â The sec
ond day of the field trials opened
cold and foggy, and the weather
remained disagreeable throughout
the entire day. The start was made
from the trial grounds at 7 a. m. and the
first brace of dogs put down was on the
Stockdale ranch, near Mr. Tevls' home.
A bevy was found in a heavy bunch of
brush surrounded by open fields.
The lirst brace was C. Young's Duke
and Gardiner & Betten's Bonnie Gem,
which were held over from yesterday.
They went down at S:3O, but neither did
very good work, the Duke making one
rather unsteady point, while both dogs
flushed several single birds. This closed
the first series, but the judge concluded
to run all the do'tfs over again on account
of the difference' In the weather between
yesterday and' to-day, and in consequence
the entire lot went into the second series.
The first brace of the second series was
J. E. Lucas' Ella E and Dr. Wilson's Sil
ver Star. These dogs, like the preceding
ones, seemed off in nose and nothing was
done until near the close of the heat,
when Ella E made a very stanch and
stylish point. A small bevy of a half
dozen or more birds was flushed by the
handlers and the dogs were then returned
to the wagon.
N. H. Hickman's Negro Joe and'Gardi
ner <& Betten's Lorenzo were turned down
In the same field. Although they ranged
fairly well. little was done in the way of
point work. After a half-hour the dogs
were ordered up. Before they reached the
handler Joe pointed In a high bunch of
weeds, but the point, of course, waa not
allowed as time had been called.
The Stockade Kennels' Zep and Walter
Hobart s Crocker Chief were next turned
down in the open and worked, across the
road into an orchard, where a fine bevy
of birds was found, and some of the best
work of the day done. The birds were
followed into a nursery across a d.Hch

whom the nations of Western Europe and
America, owe no man more than they do him
for the religious and civil liberty that they now I
jx-Fsessâ tne founder of Protestant Christendom, j
And that man. upon this subject that Is here
po much denounced, declared in the early days
of Protestant Christendom, when he was in
formed that his disciple Carlstadt was teaching
polygamy:
"1 Indee-d rnu^t confess that I cannot protest
when one takes many whet, for it does not
contradict the Fcri]itures."
And again In his Utter to Philip de Land
grftave ot Hesse, remarking upon the lact that
I'hlllp had taken a second wile, his firm wife
being still living, he said:
"In matters oi matrimony the laws of Moses
are not revoked or contradicted by the gospels. "
Yet we build monuments to I^uther, notwith
standing his totenttOÃ and defense of that form
of marriage. Now, I say all these things not
lor the purpose of arguing here ufwn the rights
of polygamy, but I do say what 1 have here re
marked for the purpose of fixing It in the minds
of members Â¦.)_Â«â¢. It is merely a, crime because
prohibited by law. I say that the L'nltod States
had the right to make that law if th^y wiabed
tu. The States have the right to make It. I'tah
had the right to make it the law of that State
and has d>Â«ne so. Consequently it Is outside of
the realm of discuttion further than in this
incidental way.
Roberts then explained the Mormon be
lief in polygamy, and said the church
through Its creed on this point came
within the constitutional inhibition against
laws prohibiting the free exercise of re
iigious belief, lie then continued:
In 18T6, desiring to put the mattt-r to a test,
Â»nd not to be uncr the odium and violating the
constitution or the lawt of the country, and
Wing confident that the courts would sustain
the views that they had held, the Mormon
church Itself furnished a case, furnished the
Â«vidence and witnesses, and brought that case
belore the courts, carrying It from one court
to another until the law a^alntt this form of
marriage Â«Â«.- buÂ»;a!ned.
It h&t kx-en recited as the chief offense, both
of the jÂ«Hi{.lf and of the member !rum Ctah.
that, notwithstanding this decision, the j>Â«<j
l .<Â¦ fctlli continued to maintain the rightfulnefcs
of that institution. The Inference se^ms to bÂ«
that as coon as the decision of the Hupreme
Court uas rendered those people should have
dropped their hand* and instantly conformed to
the law of the land. Limited, indeed, inu^t
have been th* reading of that man who would
suppose that controversies of this character
would be no rasily disposed of and that a gn;at
religious conviction would be -Immediately given
up on the decision of a court. Worthy of all
refpect. as the Fuprerne <"ourt of the I'nited
States unquestionably iÂ», and held in high es
teem amounting to almoK veneration by my
jrf-ople. still we could nut forset the tact that
the court was still human an<l liable to lall'bill
tle*. We could not [urj't the fact that this
Supreme Court ot ours, high and exalted aÂ» it
te, frequently reverses lisÂ«-If. We remember
that It ' had sustained the constitutionality of
the fugitive flave law and that its decisions
had be*-n overturned by the people by revolu
tion* is tenements as well a* revolutions In
Â»rras. I 6Â«"Â« ui'on the floor of this House a man
belonging to a race who. If absolute submis
fciveneea to the decisions of the Supreme Court
was to be the last of controversy, would
have been but a piece of poods and chattels in
this country. Instead of being a member of the
House of KeprcsentatlveÂ«.
So we thought, believing, as we did. In the
righteouknÂ»-*s of our doctrine. We hoped there
mlÂ£bt ejirlng up a sentiment which would lead
to a reversal ot opinion. Hut it did not come.
And Roberts, with arms outstretched,
uppealed to the country not to be too hard
upon the' people of Utah. He described
the condition that existed in Utah in 18W
** a rtign of terror. The Kederal courts
were bein^ used, he said, to drive women
into exile. A man was brought before the
court. He was told that he need not go to
prison if he would give up polygamy.
"But then," said Roberts; dramatically.
"I felt it would have been deserting the
cause of God to have agreed."
A scattering wave of applause passed
over the calieries at this utterance, but
It was quickly drowned with hisses.
"I had rather have my flesh hewn from
ray limbs than to have been untrue to my
people. It was this feeling that was the
incentive to the lawlessness;, euch as It
was."
But, he continued, the time came when
the Mormons of Utah were obliged to sub
mit and did rubmit. Since then there has
been not a single plural marriage in Utah.
The plural rr-iations had been broken up
In many cases.
Death had kindly solved the problem
for some, and the heartaches it left for
some made them wish the came end had
come for them. He Insisted that the com
pact with the United States had been ob
vc-rved, that polygamy had practically
ceased, that the Mormon church had given
up polygamy in good faith.
Roberts eaid he had been In public life
for twenty years, and was not driven to
the defense of his Mormon church. He
was not here representing the Mormon
church. He had received a greater num
ber of votes from Gentiles than from Mor
mons.
"You can neither exclude nor expel me "
*ald Roberts. In conclusion. "I will cling
*o hard to the pillars of liberty that you
ehall not drag me from them without
I/ringing down the whole temple." (Ad
plaust- and hisses.)
"I have lived with a good conscience un
til this day. and am sensible of no act of
shame upon my part. You can brand me
with shame and *end me forth, but 1 shall
leave with head oroct and brow undaunted
and walk the earth as angels walk the
clouds If you violate the constitution all
the shame will be with you."
There was a great outburst of applause
In the galleries when Roberts concluded.
Many of the ladies 1n the gallery were es
peciilly demonstrative.
At 5:25 p. m. the House adjourned until
31 o'clock to-morrow.

COURT RULING PROVES
DAMAGING TO MOLINEUX
Testimony Given by the Accussd at
the Inquest Is Admitted in the
Murder Trial.
NEW YORK. Jan. Â£!.â ln the trial of
Roland R. Molineux for the murder of
Mrs. Kathrrine J. Adams, Recorder Octt
to-day admitted as f-vldenoe the testi
mony of the defendant when he was a
witness in the Coroner's Inquest into thi*
death of Mrs. Adams. The defense fought
bitterly against the admission of thin
testimony ar.d half the day was spent in
thÂ« discussion of lta admissibillty.
Finally the Recorder ruled that
Molineux, while before the Coroner's
jury, wan not charged with murder ami
that OsbornÂ» might place Molineux's tes
timony before the jury.
Two damaging flat contradictions be
twef n Molinpux's testimony at the in
qupst and the evidence produced in h!>
trial exist. At the Coroner's Inquest
Molineux denied ever having used or
seen any of the trl-crescent robin's egg
blue paper. At the trial the Burns letter,
signed by Molineux and written on such
paper, was produced and acknowledged
by him.
Molineux denied at the Inquest that ha
ever sent for patent medicine by mail.
This same Burns letter, signed by Moli
neux, is an order for a patent medicine.
Not all of the testimony of Molineux at
the inquest was read to-day, but such
portions were selected aa Osborne desired
to bring before the jury. After adjourn
ment to-day Osborne aafd that he still
had four more witnesses to call, two be

WILL COURSE
MIDWEEK AT
INGLESIDE
Sport Three Days a Week to
Accommodate the Grey
hounds Ofiered.
The officers, of Tngleside Coursing Park
at a meeting last night decided to pro
mote the sport three days each week on
their field. Their first midweek stake
will be run one week from to-morrow.
The draw will be held on Monday night.
The same conditions apply as in beaten
dog stakesâ all greyhounds being eligible
which have not won first or second prize
at either of the parks within six months.
The end aimed at is to relieve the Sun
day stakes of the poorer class of dogs and
thus raise the standard of the sport. An
other effort toward this end will be marie
one week from 'Sunday. A dog must win
two courses before being entitled to share
in the prize money. The purses will re
main the same, but the value of the prize
to the winner and to the other dogs en
titled to share in the distribution will be
increased.
The annual meeting of the directorate
of Union Coursing Park was held last
right. The members of the old board
were re-elected and were thanked for the
manner in which they have managed the
affairs of the coursing association during
the past year. The new board is made up
as follows: President, George Van Ber
gen; vice president. R. W. Mastic; treas
urer. K. E. Shot well; secretary, H. Hinch
man; directorsâ J. H. Halton. R. K. Mal
com, I. P. Halton and J. Bates Janes.

TWO OF THE CREW DROWNED
TWENTY-NINE MEN" ESCAPE TO
THE OTHER VESSEL.
VINEYARD HAVEN. Mass., Jan. 22.â
i*he Glasgow steamer Ardandhu, Captain
Dundns, from New London. Conn... for
Halifax. N. S.. was sunk in collision with
the Metropolitan liner Herman Winter,
from Boston for New York off Ilobinsons
Hole. Vineyard Sound, at 3:40 o'clock this
morning and two of the Ardandhu's crew
ot thirty-one men were lost. Th*Â»y are:
Chief Engineer Joseph Henderson
cf Glasgow.
Second Mate Fred Dowe of Boston.
The Herman Wintor reached this port
this forÂ«ioon with her bow gone and re
ported the accident. She had on board
the twenty-nine men who escaped from
the Ardandhu.
The Ardandhu was struck about mid
ships on her starboard side by the Her
man Winter's bow and wa.Â« cut half-way
through. She would have sunk immedi
ately but her water-tight compartments
kept her afloat fur a time. The crew
jnad*> a ru.Â«h and it was thought that all
but Uo of them succeeded in getting
aboard the New York vessel. The Ard
andhu drifted toward the shore before she
wnt down and apparently struck on the
southwest end of Nau&bon Island and
foundered su m rir^t, her bow remaining
out of water. The Winter has a largi
hole in her how, but her collision bulK-
Ji^ads prevented the water from working
aft and she had no difficulty in making
this port.
The Ardandhu was a comparatively new
boat. She was built at Belfast, Ireland,
in I*S3. She was> made of steel and was

THE SAX FRAXCISCCX CALL, WEDNESDAY,, JANUARY 24,' 1900.
SAW JOSE IS A
WIDE-OPEN TOWN
Anti-Saloon League to
Begin a Crusade.
Special Dlsratch to The Call
SAN JOSE. Jan. 23. -The Santa Clara
County Anti-Saloon League will beg:a
an active crusade against the saloons and
all forms of vice existing in this city and
county. This was decided upon at a
meeting held yesterday afternoon at tne
Cumberland Presbyterian Church, at
which President T. C. McChesney presid
ed. Rev. J. It. Knodell of Oakland ad
dressed the league and outlined a plan of
campaign.
For some time San Jose has been a wide
open town, all kinds of gamblingâ faro,
keiro, roulette and stud pokerâ being car
ried un under the eyes ot the police, dur
ing the late jubilee celebration the gamb
lers became so bold as to move their
games out upon the sidewalk. Every rew
d.iys some visitor falls the victim of sure
thing men. The business men have com
plained and the lnst Grand Jury recom
mended that the police close the games,
but no attention has-been paid to the sug
gestion. "Ladies' entrances'! to saloons
is another evil that has aroused the tem
perance workers.
The Anti-Saloon League will commence
its campaign at once. Active steps to
close the gambling and some of the worst
resorts, where, it is asserted, young
women visit, will be taken.
The first work will be to effect a strong
county organization and open headquar
ters in San Jose. The clergy will be
asked to co-operate. The fight will first
oe taken up in this city. Tho various
churcjies and temperance societies will bÂ«
asked to contribute to a general fund.
and a leader to conduct "a warfare
against the devil" will be brought from
abroad. An active prosecution of thu
work will be carried on, and the question
of abolition. of the saloon or high licen^
will be submitted to the people. This will
probably be done at the next general
election, as at that time the question of
taxation of church property will he voted
upon and all the church people will be out
in force. It is argued that this will insure
a heavy vote for prohibition.

EASTERNERS
WILL COACH
BOTH TEAMS
Students at Berkeley and Palo
Alto Will Have Their
Wish.
BERKELEY. Jan. 23.â President Wheeler
has decided to withhold his signature from
the new law forbidding the employment
of Eastern football coaches. The measure
had passed the faculty committees of both
universities and President Jordan had
signed it, so that it only awaited Presi
dent Wheelers signature- to become op
erative. When he found that student
opinion was against the new regulation
he announced to the football committee
of the associated students that he would
attach great weight to their decision In
the matter. This was in line with the
policy outlined in the famous flagstaff
speech, in which President Wheeler said
that in case of a dispute between students
and faculty he believed the students were
generally right.
The football committee, after a pro
longed discussion, reported In favor of
retaining the hired coach a.s at present
on the ground that only in this way can
California, isolated as she is. keep pace
with the progress of the game in Eastern
colleges.
President Wheeler's reply to this report
Is to the effect that, having consulted
with President Jordan of Stanford, he
will recommend the retention oi" Eastern
coaching for two years more. This dYci
rton will leave the committees en inter-
agreement, which meet at the-
Palace Hotel next Saturday, free to pass
regulations In accordance with the senti
ments of thc.-ir constituents at Palo Alto
md Berkeley.
The racing at Oakland yesterday was
marked by many close and exciting fin
ishes. Probably the one most destined U
cause heart failure and a general break'
Ing down of the nervous system was thÂ«
battle royal indulged in between Sly anc
Afamada in the closing sprint. The for
mer mare came in for extensive backing
at odds of S to 5. as did Afamada at th<
same figure. Kullman, on Sly, brok<
away first, while Tod Walsh, astrid<
Afamada, succeeded in getting away last
Before four furlongs had been covered,
Walsh had his mount In front, looking
all over a winner. The final furlong Slj
responded gamely, ami in a hair, disturb
ing rinale, won by a head in the fast ume
of 1:13. Snips, a 2d') to 1 shot, nipped out
Harry Tboburs for the show. \\ nen put
up ai auction the winner, entered to. bt
sold for J4"O. was bid to $1200 by Frank
I>oss. Owner Dan lianlon, who hereto
fort- has bec-n very fortunate in escaping
"boosts." retained his sprinter with tht
customary $5 bid.
While tnree lirst choices were dethroned,
the ta!Â«-nt had all the best of iheargument
Â£Â«$ none of the successful horses lacked
support. John Hullman carried oft' the
sauule honors by piloting trie last three
winners.
For the opening live furlong scramble,
Momentum, with Jen Kins up. was her
alded a? the real thing, and after much
delay at thf post, won almost e&sUy from
Duke of Yum. The conditions called for
all to tarry 144 .pounds, with the usual
sex allowances. Storm King, the first
choice, was beaten for show honors by
Strong: oil.
Redwald finally left the maiden class
in tlie sprint following, over t he Futurity
course. An 11 to 5 favorite, Spencer got
him home lirst a length before J. V.
Hayes Coming Event; a well-backed one,
after leading liulf the route, ran third.
Clem Jenscins on Kevanna rode a very
pretty race on the brown horse, taking
the third number almost easily from
Tiburon. The latter ruled favorite, but
was raced to a standstill by l'ompino, a
40 to 1 shot, which showed surprising
speed. Good Hope took show honors.
It was fortunate for the backers of
(Â¦auntlet. first choice for the seven fur
long run, that the distance was no fur
ther. Montallade. alter traveling the
overland rouiÂ«\ came very fast at the
close, just losing by a head. Wliitcomb
showed a return of form by finishing
lapped on th** leaders.
13y the victory of Silver Tone, at odds of
C to 1. in the mile run, the "dope" students
were thrown in a flurry. After running
seven furlonprs. the gelding was supposed
to slop, but yesterday he kept on. and
with something in reserve, led Wyoming,
the favorite, out two lengths. In l:40U.
At the start one side of the barrier failed
to ascend an<l Walsh, astride Wynminp,
was almost unseated. This undoubtedly
militated against his chances. Toribio
downed Merry Hoy for the show.
The total number of points scored to

4Illness of Manager Rothmaler.
Oswald Rothmaler, manager of the
Western Sugar Refinery. Is In a critical
condition at the Lane Hospital. He has
been suffering from appendicitis and yes
terday it was decided to be necessary to
perform an operation. After the opera

condition is still serious. Last night he
was resting as easily as could be ex

COUNTING THE CITY MONET.
Auditor Says Charter Contains No
Provision for It.
Auditor Wells dlrcovered yesterday an
other defect In the charter. He says that
there is no provision In the new organic
law for the counting of money In the
city treasury. Under the consolidation
act this was specifically provided for.
and. although It did not prevent the
Widber defalcation, it Is thought that if
the counting of the money is carried out
in the letter as well as the spirit of the
law similar serious complications would
be avoided. -'.
The only check imposed by the charter
Is that of the joint custody safe, the
combination of which is held by the Au
ditor and Treasurer. After all the money
had been counted by Treasurer Brooks
over a million dollars was transferred to
the joint custody safe in sacks of $29,000
in gold and $!000 in silver. Whenever the
Treasurer desires any money he calls on
the Auditor and they both open the safe
and transfer the amount requested to the
outer vault. A record is kept In the safe,
wfflch is locked again by the two offi
cials. The Auditor, however, is not liable
DEMANDS WILL BE PAID.
Teachers and Janitors to Receive a
Portion of Back Salaries.
The Board of Education held a special
meeting on Monday night for the purpose
of passing the demands of the teachers
and janitors for the month of November,
1898, as a result of Judge Mura-sky's dis
solution of the injunction against the Au
ditor. As there is only $57,587 47 available
out of inheritance taxes collected to pay
tho claims, amounting to $94,405 70, the
board passed resolutions allowing 61 per
cent of the salaries. This is necessary
because none of the demands take prior
ity. Therefore the money will be divided
pro rata among the claimants.
The clerks In the Board of Education
were immediately set to work altering the
demands to the figures on the 61 per cent
basis, and after they have been signed by
Superintendent Webster they will go to
the Auditor for his signature. It is ex
pected that the demands will be ready for
payment by the end of this week.
Auditor Wells has strong hopes that the
sum remaining due on the warrants will
be paid to the teachers and janitors as
fast as other moneys are collected for col
lateral inheritance taxes and that ulti
mately the salaries both for November
and December, IS9S, will be paid In full.

parcels of land.
The Bishop's address formed the most
interesting feature of the day's session
and was listened to attentively by all
the delegates present. At the outset he
furnished his opinion on the question of
wht-ther this is the nineteenth or ihe
twentieth century by asserting his belief
that it will take this year to round out tne
nineteenth century. The address was
largely a matter of statistics regarding
the work he had accomplished during the
year and what he had done during f .!ie
last decade. The number confirmed dur
ing the year was given as T3S. For the
decade the number confirmed was S2Vj; the
number of clergymen ordained, 1W; the
number of churches built, 8, and the num
ber of times the Bishop had officiated 2418.
An eloquent tribute was paid to the
memory of those noted in the church who
had passed away during the year, and the
address was afterward punctuated wnh
the 'â¢All Saints' Prayer."
The report of the secretary of the boanl
of missions show<-d a hoalthy rate of
prosres*. While there were but sixteen
workers in the Held in IS*.*), there are now
thirty-.-ight. .
Major Hooper precipitated a lengthy
discussion by making a plea that the
salary of Archdeacon Emery be fixed at
$1500, '1n order that he might practically
become the assistant of the Bishop, whom
Mr. Hooper thought to be much ov< r
worked. The question was laid over for
linal consideration until to-day.
A united service was held at 8 o clock
in the evening in the interest of the
Brotherhood of St. Andrew and the
Daughters of the King, during which
there were ten-minute addresses by the
Bey. E. U Parsons, the Rev. D. O. Kelley,
Dr. George L. Baker and Ralph Daniels.
This service was followed by an Informal
reception in tho Sunday school room.
At 2 o'clock in tho afternoon there was
a semi-annual conference of officers of
the California branch of the Romans
Auxiliary, at which routine matters wore
disposed" of. On Friday the Woman s
Auxiliary exercises will form the princi
pal feature. At that time Rev. Dr dam
pen, the rector of Trinity Church, will
deliver the sermon.

IDEA ON CENTURY PROBLEM
ARCHDEACON'S SALARY CAUSES
WIDE DISCUSSION.
Interesting Programme Prepared fo:
the Consideration of Delegates
During the Rest of the
Week.
The semi-centennial convention of the
Episcopal Diocese of California, which
will last for three days, was called to or
der Us Trinity Church, Bush and Gough
streets, yesterday morning at 10 o'clock
by Bishop William F. Nichols. Rev. R. C.
Foute, the president of the standing com
mittee, officiated as celebrant of the holy
communion, after which Rev. M. D. Wil
son wes elected secretary and Herbert
Kolger assistant secretary. Bishop Nich
ols followed with a sermon which con
cluded the morning session, and Â«n ad
journment v.as taken to 3 o'clock in the
afternoon.
-The Church's Glory of Cross Rearing"
was the title of the sermon and the text,
"Unto him be glory in the church by
Christ Je^us throughout all ages, world
Â¦without cad," was taken from Ephesians
ill :Â£l.
"This is the ascription, the ideal and
apostolic policy fur the church all in one."
paid the preacher in introducing his
theme. "We usod it this morning more
especially for its apt putting of a pure
and primitive church policy. There is a
freshness and htalih of the childhood of
the church about it. It glows with the
lervor of apostolic zeal. If we could have
cur notion of what a church ought to be
clothed in, choice and precise, it has al
ready been done fe>r us htreâ unto him
Â£lory in the church.
â¢\btit perhaps at nrst the text docs not
leave an altogether clear impression on
tJie mind. Most of our impressions of the
church that re-ally count with us have
been very definite, as reproaches ui>on the
church are not lacking in distinctness.
Now. every plotia. that we say or sing in
th.- servk-is is a help into a better in-
Blgnt into the meaning cf the text. Glory
m the church should be the intense con
oern of each and every age, as it comes
and goes out of each and every century
and liaH century- The most vital question
that can be askied about the half century
oi th-- diocese that so nearly coincides
v.;th the last half of the nineteenth cen
tury s<.-eins to me to be what glory has
be. r. given in the church. To answer thai
eju-->t:'j:i is to group the data around one
ar.d all of those whose kind manipulations
.Â¦; that piory we lind in the cUiirch of the
N> w Testament: namely, the glory of
crosF ijeuring, of worship and of general
character."
For some time- the speaker dwelt on the
trials of the church in California during
ih" last fifty ye-ars, during which he re-
Jerred in words of high praise to the work
Â«t the Bey. Flare! s. Mines, the tirst reo
tor ar.d founder of Trinity Church, whose
mfferiiiK from disease was such that his
ministry vas referred to as "literally that
<Â¦: a living man." He said that in lhM the
missionary board in the Kast declared
California, no longer a missionary ground
and on July 24 of that year the rirst con
vention was held in Trinity Chapel, the
ministers present being Key. Flavel S.
Mines. Key. John L. Ver Mehr. LU D..
Ke-v. Samuel Morehouse, Rev. Augustus
Fitch. Rev. Tornwnd Huddart and Key.
W. R. I^avf'nworth.
"Doi:'t look back upon the past and sing
dirpr-t." exhorted the Bishop. "The lives ;
of the?e men teach us that true worth and
ability rratly "come through conquering'
obstacles, through cross-bearing. To-day,
much as we need sjinctiried stewardship,
much as we need Influence In the great
agencies ol the Government, of education,
moral, social, political and economic re
form, we need still more the realization of
the power of the cross. Without that key
the fifty years of diocesan life form mere
hieroglyphics."

nominations for standing committees,
boards and officials. The following were
the nominations, which will be confirmed
by vote to-day:

FATHER CLARK
WELCOMED BY
ENDEAVOR HOST
Starting on a Tour of
the World.
RESULT OF AN EXPERIMENT
HAS SPREAD FAR BEYOND ALL
EXPECTATIONS.
Nineteenth Anniversary of the First
Society Will Be Celebrated
in Maine During This
Month.
Rev. Francis E. Clark, the father of
Christian Endeavor, was given a genuine
"Californlan welcome" last night by the
largest crowd that could assemble in the
First Congregational Church. The founder
of the Endeavor movement arrived in this
city yesterday, and will leave to-day on
the steamer China for the Orient.
"Father" Clark formed the first Chris
tian Endeavor society nineteen years ago.
He was then pastor of a church In Port
land, Me. The movement met with popu
lar approval, other churches followed the
example set them by Mr. Clark, and the
society spread until now it has branches
all over the entire world.
Mr. Clark's headquarters are now in
Boston. Mass. There he edits the official
organ of the Endeavor Union, besides at
tending to the numerous other duties
which his position as president entails.
His present tour will take him through
Siberia, China, Japan and Russia, and
will enable him to be present at the
world's convention to be held in London.
â¢ Mrs. Clark accompanies her husband on
all his travels, and he says he finds her
assistance Invaluable, especially in Ori
ental countries where the prejudices of
the people make it impossible lor a man
to address a congregation of women. Mr.
and Mrs. Clark have their little son with
them, and will take him on the entire
tour.
"My object In going to the Orient at
this time," said Dr. Ciark. "is to be pres
ent at the convention to be held at Foo
chow. in China, another in Japan and
finally to see what the whole world can do
at the international convention at London
In June. In a few days it will be the
nineteenth anniversary of the society at
the little church where I launched the
experiment that I had no idea was to
prove such a success and to spreaa
throughout the whole world. This move
ment is the greatest religious event of the
century. No one could foresee what that
little meeting at Woolaston was to pro
duce, but It is plainly to be seen that it
was not the work of man, but the work of
God."
Mr?. Clark made a few remarks regard
ing the practical work of Christian En
deavor, and when she finished speaking
she was cheered, while all the women
waved their handkerchiefs.
"Common whisky Is a curseâ the Old Gov-
ernment is a blessing. â¢

Offices Not Blended.
Attorney General Tlrey L. Ford yester
day. In an opinion to D. J. Hall. District
Attorney of Trinity County, held that
â¢where one person under an ordinance of
the Board of Supervisors fills the offices
of Coroner and Public Administrator and
fails to file his bond as Public Adminis
trator within the time required by law.
such failure does not affect the title of
the person to the office of Coroner, the
offices being separate and not so blended
that the bond executed for the faithful
performance of the duties of one would
embrace the obligations of the other.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
SAN FRANCISCO JUSTICES.
Election for the Offices to Be Held
Next Fall.
Secretary of State Curry sent to Attor
ney General Tlrey L. Ford an Inquiry a3
to whether the names of candidates for
Justices of the Peace In San Francisco
should be placed on the general or mu
nicipal ticket. Mr. Ford In his response
states that Justices of the Peace In the
city and county of San Francisco are Judi
cial officers under the State constitution;
that they are to be elected at the same
time and In the same manner that State
officers are elected; that they are not city
and county officers, and therefore do not
come within section 1196 of the Political
Code; and further, that the names of the
parties to be voted for for the office of
Justice of the Peace should be placed
upon the general ticket, within the mean
ing of section 1197 of the Political Code.
"It Is assumed in the foregoing," the opin
ion states, "that under the law there Is
to be an election for Justices of the Peace
'next fall,' that is, In November, 1900."
STATE HEALTH BOARD
DISCUSSES THE PLAGUE
INTERESTING SESSION AT THE
GRAND HOTEL.
Dr. Bazet Offers a Timely Paper on
the Spread of Tuberculosis and
Members Consider Quar
antine Matters. f
The four members of the State Board of
Health met last night in the Grand Hotel
to listen to a paper by Dr. L. Bazet upon
the prophylaxis of tuberculosis and to
discuss quarantine measures for the pre
vention of the introduction of the bubonic
plague.
The meeting was continued from an ad
journment taken in Sacramento Monday
night. There were present Dr. D. D.
Crowley of Oakland. Dr. C. A. Ruggles of
Stockton. Dr. L. Bazet of this city and
Dr. \V. P. Mathews. After the session
had been In progress for some time Dr.
J. M. Williamson and other members of
the city Board of Health came in to listen
and to participate In the discussion.
Dr. Bazet's paper was a lengthy treatise
on the contagious properties of tubercu
losis. He cited a number of authorities
and tables of statistics to show the rapid
Kprea<i ot the disease through contact
with tuberculous subjects. After an ex
haustive and detailed statement of the
virulence of the disease he concluded by
advocating a number of hygienic rules
to prevent the spread of consumption. The
main purpose ot the paper was to corrob
orate the stand taken by the State board
some time ago whtn ft suggested a State
quarantine against those afflicted with
consumption. ' Â« â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦
It was resolved to take charge of the
quarantine tug Governor Perkins, with
the consent of the Governor.
The next Â»Ã¼bject for discussion was the
bubonic plague. Dr. Bazet was appointed
a committee of one to st-e Dr. Ktuiyon ot
the Federal quarantine service and re
quest him to notify the State board if any
case of bubonfc plague entered the port.
ITALIAN EDITOR ON
TRIAL FOR LIBEL
CHARGE BASED ON AN ARTICLE
IN LA CRITICA.
Dr. de Lucis, the Aggrieved Party,
Puts on Witnesses to Testify
Against the Defendant,
Mancini.
The trial by jury of G. Mancini, editor
of La Critlca, on the charge of criminal
libel preferred by Dr. A. de Lucls, attract
ed a large number of the Italian colony
yesterday afternoon to Judge Mogan's
court. Dr. de Lucis was represented by
Prosecuting Attorney Harris and Attor
ney Madden, and the defendant by Attor
neys Devoto and Percy Long.
The article complained of appeared in
La Critlca last October. It charged the
doctor with having been convicted of a,
felony in Italy and other offenses. The
doctor was called as the first witness and
denied the allegations in the article. He
testified that Mancini called upon him at
his office and demanded $100 to refrain
from publishing the article. Mancini was
ordered out of the office. Mrs. Emma
Rose, the doctor's sister-in-law, testified
that she was in his office "at the time. She
corroborated the doctor's testimony.
Charles Boreos. 632 Broadway, testified
to a conversation with Mancini, during
which Manclnl said that De Lucls was
"blowing" himself In saloons, and If he
had paid him the money he was squan
dering the article would not have ap
peared. Manclnl added that De Lucis had
offered him $5 Out of charity, which was
indignantly refused. F. Blaglnl, 563
Greenwich street, gave similar testimony.
At this stage F. Cavagnaro, wine mer
chant, and Dr.' Joseph Pescia were called
for the defense. The former testified that
he had heard the doctor's character dis
cussed and It was bad. Dr. Pescia testi
fied that Mancinl's character was good.
The case was then continued till to-mor
row afternoon. ;,-,_.<
Chinese Weapons Retained.
Judge Cabaniss refused yesterday to
make an order returning to Chinese
weapons taken from them when arrested

means in the present condition of China
town. The application had been made
by A. S. Newburgh. who claimed that
the police had no right to interfere with
the privileges of citizens.

OCEAN VIEW RAILROAD
GATE AND ITS HOODOO
Another Accident Barely Averted by
the Prompt Action of Corporal
Shanahan.
Had it not been for the prompt action of
Corporal Shanahan yesterday afternoon
there would have been another case for
the Coroner at the railroad crossing at
Ocean View. At 5:30 p. m., as the incoming
train approached the crossing, a China
man was driving a wagon on his way
home from the cemetery. The Mongolian
had got Inside the gate when the rcun in
charge of the crossing discovered the
train approaching. He rushed to the
crank and proceeded to lower the gates
before the team on which the Chinaman
was driving had got clear of the crossing.
The result was that the arm of the lower
ing gate caught the top of the wagon and
held the vehicle fast in a position where
the train would cut it through. Corporal
Shanahan, who is In charge of the Ocean
View police station, fortunately happened
to be standing by at the time, and he
rushed in and raised the arm of the gate
sufficiently to ease the wagon and at the
same time melted the horse's head and
turned him to one side, thus swinging the
wagon clear of the passing train. The
frightened Mongolian jumped from his
seat and ran like a liberated wild animal.
It was some time before Corporal Shana
han could induce him to take charge of
his team and drive off. The man whom

THE EXTRA SESSION.
yHAT was long ago foretold by The Call and
M expected by the public has happened. Gov
ernor Gage has issued a call for an extra ses
sion of the Legislature. A full report of the document
may be found in another column. It outlines several
important measures on which legislation, it is
claimed, is required at this time, as delay, in the
Governor's estimation, would be prejudicial to pub
lic interests. \\ hether or not the taxpayers would
have preferred to wait for the regular session is no
longer an issue. The call has been sent forth and the
extra session will be held.
With this action the attention of the people will
turn irom the Governor to the Legislature. Upon
the members of the two houses it depends whether
the session is to be long, costly and fruitless or worse
than fruitless, or whether it will result promptly in ac
tions which will merit and receive the approval of the
people.
If the legislators deal wisely and promptly with the
measures they have been called to consider, and elect
a United States Senator worthy of the honor, there
will be no complaint of the session. Such actions will
more than repay all the money the session may cost.
If, on the other hand, the Senatorial election result
in another time of confusion and disagreement, if it
delay the performance of the work for which the ses
sion has been specifically called, or if it result in the
election of a man of the Dan Burns stripe, then the
session will be not only an extravagance, but a po
*
litical blunder of the worst kind.
The Republicans in the Senate and the Assembly
cannot overlook the importance of the Senatorship.
We are on the eve of a Presidential campaign. The
contending parties in this State are not unequally di
vided. It requires a comparatively small change in
the vote to transfer California from the Republican
to the Democratic column, and consequently any
"â¢ ' .. Â¦ J
issue which complicates a Presidential campaign is
dangerous to the party which precipitates that issue
upon the voters. It will be the fault of the Republi
cans of the Legislature if the Senatorial question re
mains to be fought over in the coming campaign,
and accordingly it is their duty to settle it at once
Â¦-" Â« Â¦ Â¦Â¦'.â¢"-'-Â¦'*Â¦Â¦
It must be borne in mind, however, that it would be
better to leave the issue open than to attempt to close
it by the election to the United States Senate of a
man whom the people regard with a just suspicion
of corruption and whom they would reject at the
polls. The only way to eliminate the issue from the
coming campaign is by electing a Senator who repre
sents the genuine Republicanism of the State, one
whoÂ«e election will not be an offense to the honesty
and the intelligence of the party and to the inde
pendent voters. With what chance of success couli
the Republican candidates for the Legislature appeal
for re-clccticn this fall if in addition to a costly extra
session they had no better record of work to show
than the election of a disreputable boss, or the tool
of a boss, to the United States Senate?
This, then, is the issue that confronts the Repub
licans of the Legislature, and there is but one way
of meeting it wisely. The Senatorial contest should
be disposed of at once, and then the other work of
the session be taken up and finished with prompt
ness and good judgment. The people will not grudge
the cost of the session if the work be well done, but
there will be a day of sad reckoning for somebody if
the results of the session prove disappointing to the
wishes of the people.

soldier; ami^from Carlyle's account of the battle of
Fontenoy is brought the statement, "The English'
officers, it is evident, behaved in their usual manner,
without knowledge of war or fear of death."
Another view is presented by a writer for the Lon
don Telegraph, who in presenting the German esti
mate of the situation says: "It is the opinion of
most Germans that England is verging upon the state
of senile decay. Their Government regards it as un
sentimental business to provide for that as for every
other eventuality. Germany prepares for every new
development. Each new development finds England
unprepared. The South African situation repeats the
old weary lesson to our dull ears, while we rely upon
nothing safer than our faculty for 'pulling through,'
a faith worth no more and no less than that of the
hopeful pitcher which still journeys to the well. Eng
land is like an athlete out of training, who must yet
strip for the struggle. If the checks of the South Af
rican campaign could awaken the country to an
effectual sense of the absolutely vital necessity of
emulating Germany in foresight and energy, the
Transvaal war would be the salvation of the empire."
Of course the jingo party in the kingdom will make
abundant use of the reverses as arguments for increas
ing the army. Their creed is that neither the Minis
try nor the generals are to blame, but the taxpayers
to object to military expenditures. Each of these va
rious views discloses more or less truth concerning
the British. To outsiders, however, their defeats wil\
not seem wholly to their discredit The fact is that
no nation could have done better. The Boers are
good fighters, and have shown they know how to
fight with strategy as well as with valor. Even the
Kaiser's proud army would not find an invasion of
the Transvaal a holiday march.
AMERICAN GIRLS AND TITLED HUSBANDS.
WARNING BY THE
COMTESSE DE CHAVANNE
â¢^-T N American girl had better be dead than married
f j to one of these foreign aristocrats. Let these so
fâj called noblemen aloneâ that Is my advice to every
I young American woman."
A Above is the advice spoken by La Comtesse Lo
rean de Chavanne at the Waldorf to a New York World
representative on Sunday last. The Comtesse was Miss
Oulrda Benson of Brooklyn, daughter of Captain Henry
John Benson of the revenue cutter service.
"Yes, let the American girl beware the titled foreign
ers," continued La Comtesse. "If she is married to one
she will rue It"
Mme. La Comtesse says she knows, for she tried it.
"I want to warn American young women to shun the
decadent foreigners with titles who try to marry rich
wives," she added. "It Is a matter of barter and sale. I
was an American girl, and when very young I married a
Frenchman of title. When he died, not long ago, I found
among his papers a contract which he had made with a
person who was In that business â to find him an eligible
wife with a fortune. He paid In Installments for the ser
vices of the person who brought me to his attention.
"He squandered my money, and my life was unhappy.
My experience is typical of the rottenness of the foreign
aristocracy, especially that of France.
"Among these impecunious nobles flourishes the busi
ness of high-class matrimonial agents with a quasi-social
standing, who for a commission find wives for marriage
able men of title.
"It Is infamy, and I want to warn the poor little Amer
ican girls who go abroad with false notions and who are
easily dazzled by a title against the sham of It.
"As the wife of the Count Chavanne I moved for some
years in the society of the Faubourg St. Germain. I know
Its little sins and Its big sins. I know its scandals and I
know the private history of many persons whose names
are spoken with awe In the society of New York City.
Some years ago a titled foreigner married an heiress of
this city whose family was socially prominent here.
The histories of many of them will not bear lns P ect 'Â° n "
"When there la marriage without love how can you
keep out scandal? High society in France has all too much
of it. It is honeycombed with It.
"When the poor American girl whose papa has aft.
bank account goes to Paris she is flattered by attentions
which she receives from lime. This and Mme. That.
"Madame proposes to introduce her to her own milli
ner where she can secure the very latest Frencn gowns.
Such a thoughtful kindness touches the little American
clrl who can never know that Madame gets a commis
sion from the milliner. She will get a commission on the
little American girl. too. If she can manage to marry her
to some gilded nobleman. . "*-nÂ». â,*>,
"Sham, hypocrisy, deceit and lying are typical of French
noblemen In high society. Women of title and fashion
rent their opera boxes by the year. A night comes when
she does not care to so to the opera. Mme. Somebody
offers it to some American family, flattered to death to
be seen In the titled Frenchwoman's opera box. No. she
won't accept pay. but if the liberal Americans want to
give anything to My Lady's poor fund, why it will be ac
" When I left France I Â¦was assured of a fine Income If
I would only keep a sharp watch here for rich American
heiresses intending to go to Paris, and provide the- means
for their introduction to the proper parties in Paris."
La Comtesse was educated In a Paris convent and
was introduced abroad by Mrs. Torrence. daughter of
OI1 She married when very young, her husband flying six
years ago. She will live temporarily In Philadelphia. La
Comtesse has written her life in the form of a noveL It

to the number of warships Germany is at present con

a possible European coalition. It is evident she must
build more ships or seek a potent ally. Under such

BRITISH VIEWS OF THEMSELVES.
ONE of the effects of the Boer victories in the
war in South Africa has been that of setting
the British to studying themselves for the pur
pose of determining why they were not able to finish
the war in three months, as they expected to do. To
thct extent the disasters have been beneficial to them,
for no matter how erroneous may be the conclusions
it is always more or less profitable for a self-satisfied
people to be brought to a recognition of the fact that
there is something about them with which they
should not be satisfied. The sick and sorrowful man
who after a night of revelry attributed his sad condi
tion to the small hot bird and not to the large cold
bottle was in error, but all the same he had learned
something and would not again be so rash in revelry
for a loner time to come.
One set of Britishers attribute the whole evil to
the Ministry. They see nothing wrong with the na
tion itself. Another set argue that the nation is to
blame because it would never permit any Ministry to
maintain the army on a scale equal to what the needs
of the empire require. A third set attribute every
disaster to the officers in command. They assert that
the army is large enough and sufficiently well
equipped for war, that the people and the Ministers
have done all that could be required, and that no
body is to blame except the generals.
One of the learned advocates of the latter view
quotes from the great writers of bygone times to
show that in the past as in the present the British
officer has rarely been of any value except to lead men
to death. Thus in the days of the Stuarts John Dry
den said: "We all have to admit that the French
understand the management of war better than we
do, although of course we are fully aware we can beat
them." Napier is quoted as having said the British
"are warlike, but not military." Kinglake is cited
as frequently setting forth the incompetency of the
British staff in contrast with the valor of the British
three Continental powers exceeds that of the British,
yet in actual fighting force the British are equal to
them all. Of ships now in process of construction the
Chronicle gives these tables:

COMMENTS OF INTERIOR PRESS
ON CHIEF OF POLICE SCANDAL
Tulare Register.
They are having a nice time in San Francisco over the appointment of Esola
to be Chief of Police. Among other circumstances of interest brought to light Is
the one that Dan Burns was instrumental in getting Esola on the police force In
the first Instance, and that Dan is behind him, helping to push him along. \\ itn
Burns pushing a Democrat to the front and the unspeakable Lawrence pulling
him like a tug of war, Mayor Phelan cught to be proud of his appointee.
Stockton Dally Independent.
When the charges against Esola were filed with Mayor Phelan as the official
head of San Francisco the latter took the charges direct to Andrew Lawrence of
the Examiner, and according to the testimony the charges were in the hand 3 of
Harry Morse, a private detective, in a few hours after being delivered to Pnelfn.
Was not this a singular procedure for the Mayor of a city, who had qualified,
under a non-partisan charter? Mayor Phelan is not so pronounced a partisan
from a political standpoint, but he is all the time a radical partisan from the-
Phelan standpoint. He la now engaged in carrying out Phelan s bargains with a
yellow newspaper.
Wlnnemucca Silver State.
The San Francisco flght over the selection of a Chief of Police has shattered
an Idol by showing Mayor Phelan In the light of a cheap politician. Of course.
It was not to be supposed that a blackmailing sheet like the Examiner would
do anything without the expectation of reward, but It Is a general surprise to
find a man like Phelan entering into an agreement to allow the Examiner to
name the Chief of Police as the price of Its support. Yet that appears to be ex
actly the understanding had between Phelan and the Examiner prior to the late
municipal election in San Francisco.
THE KAISER AND HIS NAVY.
WITH a promptness unusual in diplomacy Great
Britain hastened to give Germany an explana
tion of the offenses committed against Ger
man shipping in Delagoa Bay by British war ves
sels. To many Germans the promptness was doubt
less very agreeable, but to some it was not, and the
Kaiser is one of the latter class. He wishes a
large appropriation for a new navy, and he would
have had much better chances of obtaining a favor
able vote from the Reichstag if there had been less
haste on the part of the British in giving the soft
answer which is designed at least to turn away
wrath.
The bill providing for the additions to the navy
which the Kaiser desires is now before the Reichstag,
but according to reports from Berlin its passage is
still a matter of uncertainty. Of course, every ad
vantage has been taken of the events in Delagoa Bay
to rouse popular sentiment and force the opposition
in the Reichstag to vote for the measure. In the
meantime the Kaiser's speech on New Year's day
was not reassuring. His declaration that he wished
a navy commensurate with his army in order that he
might carry out his policies is calculated to alarm the
taxpayers and the peace-loving people of the empire.
An aggressive policy of conquest or colonization will
cost a great deal and Germany is not rich.
The British are watching the whole performance
with close interest. It is still their intention to main
tain a navy equal to that of France, Germany and
Russia combined. The strain, however, is becoming
intense and since the events of the South African war
have made it clear that a more efficient army will have
to be maintained hereafter, the thought of expending
more money for additional warships is not pleasing to
the British taxpayer any more than to the German.
The London Chronicle in a recent review of the
comparative naval strength of the four powers esti
mates that Great Britain has at present a conspicuous
advantage over any combination that can be made
against her. Excluding from consideration all ships
constructed prior to 1881, which are described as "a
secondary armament not affecting the relative fight
ing power," the Chronicle gives the lists for the na
tions in tabular form thus:
BATTLESHIPS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1900.
THE IMPOLICY OF SECRECY
SOMETHING has appeared in Congress for
which the country was wholly unprepared. In
all of his public expressions, official and other
wise â if, indeed, any expression by the President on
a public policy can be anything but official â President
McKinley has prepared the country to expect Con
gressional action upon all questions affecting our
new possessions. During the recess of Congress a
vast procession of events passed, and why they were
could not be explained by the executive. His acts
were within the conceived limit of his authority. Be
yond that the whole issue was with Congress.
Now there is no possibility of Congressional action
that shall be wise and well for our own people, and for
those that we seek permanently to control, unless Con
gress has possession of the information that is solely
in the keeping of the executive. Without this it is
legislating in the dark. It may hit or miss the right
mark. It must act at random.
As soon as Congress met it became apparent that
there was no disposition on the part of the support
ers of the administration to formally ask for dis
closure of the facts upon which legislation must be
based. This was a capital error. In this Government
its servants must keep in touch with the people and
must trust them. They are governing in the name
and for the purposes of the people, and what they
know about the business belongs to the people. It
would have been in right line with republican prin
ciples and practice to have asked the administration
for a frank disclosure, at the request of its own par
tisans, of everything required to enlighten Congress
and the country. As the supporters of the administra
tion neglected this plain duty, when they should have
gladly asked for the facts, and the President should
have as gladly disclosed them, the situation was aban
doned, to be occupied by the minority, by the oppo
nents of the administration. This was a tactical mis
take of the gravest nature. No matter if amongst those
who took advantage of it is the paretic Senator for
South Dakota, poor Pettigrew. Expressing contempt
for him and calling him names will only temporarily
divert the attention of the country from the real situ
ation. So far every resolution honestly intended to
get light on the situation has been sidetracked. Even
when an obviously proper inquiry was made into the
cost of garrisoning Cuba and holding her in the
coarse grip of military authority, it was promptly ob
jected to and killed. -In this process of concealment
the administration Senators have gone to the length
of withdrawing from the chamber, to hold secret
caucus, to return and vote against letting the peo
ple know the least fact about a war and insular ad
ministration to which they are contributing their
blood and treasure. Can any one explain why Con
gress and the people should not know what we are
doing in Cuba and at what cost? What public policy
or national interest can be injured by such informa
tion? We are not at war in that quarter of the
world. There are no rebels in the field to be encour
aged by letting American taxpayers know what it is
costing them to garrison the island, and withhold
from its people the freedom and self-government we
promised should be theirs. Then why object to giv
ing them the information?' We say it is not repub
lican to object; it is not republican to refuse to con
fide in the people.
Turning to the Philippines, the situation is no bet
ter and the reason for secrecy worse. Though not
said officially, it is in the air that nothing can be even
whispered about the Philippines, because there we* arc
at war! For months an unmanly pretense has been
kept up that the administration is in possession of
facts showing correspondence between anti-imperial
ists and the public enemy. This was apparently to
deter minority inquiry. But, if true, it should have
been the highest reason for majority inquiry. Does
not every Republican see that to refuse to give out
the information which belongs to the people, because
we are at war in the Philippines, implies the conceal
ment of all facts until such war ceases, and that, as
Congress has no control over that war which it never
declared, its technical prolongation may be indefinite,
and no fact concerning it, including its cost, will ever
reach the people? Under such conditions there can
be no useful and wholesome public opinion in the
country. The Republican party must bear the bur
den of distrust of the people, and the situation is not
helped by the canting repetition that "there is noth
ing to conceal," while nothing is disclosed.
The people are not children. They can stand the
effect of any information in the keeping of the ad
ministration. The Republican party is about to enter
a campaign in which it will approach the public judg
ment with affirmative propositions involving princi
ples. It should protest against being compelled to
defend the sinister policy of refusing to let the people
know all about the new possessions which have come
to us as the saddest fact in all our history.
The Republican party is responsible for all insular
administration. Do not Republicans see that when all
inquiry is suppressed and all information refused
there is given to corruption in the islands a license
that will not lack scoundrels to take advantage of it?
For our own safety the supporters of the administra
tion should hail the searchlight and bathe ever)' fact
in its beams.

BOERS SUFFER FROM
THE LYDDITE SHELLS
BOER CAMP, Upper Tugrela River, Sun
day, Jan. 2Lâ After Commandant Botha
checked the British advance yesterday
morning It was expected that there would
be no further action until to-morrow. This
afternoon, however, signs were discerned
of an Intended movement In the British
northern camp.
When the heat, which was more fright
ful than any yet experienced, had worn
off the British cannon started in full force,
and the Infantry advanced In extended
order.
Generals Botha and Cronje held the
high hills over which the road to Lady
smith passed. When the Mauser tire
opened a pandemonium of sound filled the
air. Tho vindictive crash of lyddite shells,
the sharp volleys of Lee-Metfords and the
whiplike crack of Mausers were inter
spersed with tho boom of the Boer Max
ims. Tho battle ended with darkness, but
not without evidences of execution among
the British that was manifest at sunrise.
Field Cornet Ernst Emilio was killed,
nor did the generals escape unscathed. At
the central position, Swartzkop, where
the other road to Ladysmith crosses the
hills, the British advanced from low
kopjes on the banks of the Tugela unmo
lested. Then they entered the zone of
Mauser nre, and although their naval
guns kept up the usual terrible racket,
the advance was stopped, and the British
had to count out their dead and wounded
Commandant Viljoen and two burghers
were knocked senseless by an explosion
of lyddite, but Commandant Viljoen re
covered. Field Cornet Hilbron was wound
ed, and on refusing to surrender was shot
The British loss was probably insignifi
cant. Ihey complain that expansive bul
lets in Mausers were fired in the field
and soft-nosed bullets with Lee-Metfords.'
The Boers admit that sporting Mausers
were occasionally found, but they deny
tho charge respecting expansion bullets

cannon or rifle at the Swartzkop position

HEAD LAAGER, LADYSMITH? Saturl
day Jan. 20.-Tho sixty-ninth birthday
of General Joubert was celebrated by
General Botha making a reconnolssance
in force toward the Drakensberg Moun
tains and turning the British advance
after a short engagement. General Jou
bert accompanied President Steyn to the
Free State laagers, south of Ladysmith
The Piesldent was In high spirits He
proposes to make a tour of ail thÂ«
laagtrs.
The Boer movement on tho British ad
vance above referred to may have had
reference to General Warren's forward
lighting, in which, according to advices
from British sources received yesterday
the Boers were on the defensive almost
the entire day Sunday, save once when
they attempted to outflank the British
left and were signally checkmated
INCIDENTS OF BATTLE
FROM BOER SOURCES
BOER CAMP, Upper Tugela River, Fri
day, Jan. 19.â The British now occupy
three positions along the Tugela River.
Their naval guns have been firing steel
pointed armor-piercing shells.
Reports being received that 2000 British
cavalry were attempting to outflank us
ulong the Drakensberg ridge, a strong pa
trol was sent to reconnoiter. Mistaking
their scouts, the patrol proceeded to a
kopje, from which a terrific rifle and
Maxim gun fire suddenly opened. The
Boers lost fourteen men killed and twenty
wounded. The British loss was probably
Insignificant.
The bombardment of the Boer positions
from Swartzkop was resumed yesterday,
chiefly from a battery brought acroÃS the
Sectional Plan of the New $1,200,000 Dock Being Built at Mare Island
river. In the afternoon the cannonading
became exceedingly brisk, and under cover
thereof the infantry advanced in three
lines to a second row of kopjes which
they occupied at nightfall, but later they
retired to their old position.
During the nleht a score of shells were
fired by the British, and a balloon was
Bent up to spy out the Boer positions. The
naval guns renewed the bombardment this
morning from a new position, but without
result.
The three British positions are the old
Chleveley camp, near Colenso; the central
position at Swartzkop Drift, where they
hold both banks of the river, and a point
higher up in the direction of Zunkles.
where they have bridged the river and
established an immense commissariat On
the Bummlt of the terraces at Schwarzkop
they have placed five naval guns, and
have brought the field artillery across the
river to a small kopje on the northern
bank, whence they keep up an Incessant
and terriflo cannonade of the Boer
trenches. Since the beginning of the week
communication with the different posi
tions has been kept up under the ordeal
of this cannonade, the casualties resulting
from this being heavier than those occur
ring at Colenso. One of the shells from
the naval puns killed a father and son.
Free Staters, who were chatting at the
time. Strangely, neither had any visible
wounds.
BOER PATROL'S PREDICAMENT.
PRETORIA, Sunday, Jan. 2Lâ A dis
patch from Colesberg, Cape Colony, says
the British attacked the Boer positions
there at 10 o'clock this morning. There
was heavy fighting, but with what re
sult is not known. According to the
latest accounts the Boers were holding
their positions.
A dispatch from Colenso of Thursday,
January IS, says a patrol of 200 men,
under Field Cornet Opporman. while
scouting was surrounded, but succeeded
In fighting its way back. It is reported
that four men were killed and that thirty
were wounded and made prisoners.
FIGHTING IN BECHUANALAND.
GABERONES, Bechuanaland, Jan. 17,
via Lourenzo Marquez, Jan. 23.â A recon
noltering force this morning found the
Boers on the Baute Hill, which the Brit
ish, supported by an armored train, oc

south of Fort Oeberones. They describe
it as large and strongly intrenched. The
Boers continuo tho destruction of the
railroad near Crlsdel Pools.

Mrs. M. A. Swift, wife cf Chaplain Hen
ry Swift cf the Thirteenth Regiment, now
in Manila, was adjudged Insane yester
day by the Insanity Commissioners, ani
In the afternoon was sent to the asylum
at Agnews.
Mrs. Swift attempted to commit eulclde
la her coll about 9 o'clock yesterday morn
iv.g. While she was in the female ward
Ir. the hospital 6 he told Matron Kane that
if she was not allowed her usual eupply
of morphineâ fifteen jrrair.s a day â she
wruld end her life. Ehe was allowed a
h.iif-jrrain every two hours, which did not
ra!!sfy her.
When Mrs. Swift was removed to the
Ir.pane ward Monday Mr*. Kane told Ma
troa Wells to be careful, as the- patient
had threatened to commit suicide. Mrs.
Wells spoke to Mrs. Swift about it. aiid
the promised not to do away with herself.
A policeman was detailed to watch her.
At^jut 9 o'clock yesterday morning Mrs.
Wc'.'.s heard a noise like that produced
by th* tearing of linen. She asked the
policeman to look into Mrs. Swift's ceil.
Hi r<-pnrtp<l that Mrs. Swift was in bed.
Mrs. Wells satisfied herself that nothing
w:iÂ« wrong, but a few minutes later
Flipped back to th* cell and saw Mrs.
Swift tying the ends cf the sheet of her
bed. which she had torn in half, to the
tnp hinpe of the window in her cell. Mrs.

corned the door Mrs. Swift was in bed.
Mrs. Wells made her get up, and discov
ered that the torn eheet was tied tightly
around her neck, the ends being concealed
under the nightdress. A careful watch
was kept on Mrs. Swift after that till
'he was placed In the Sheriff's van on

The case apalnst Mrs. Swift for obtain

nÂ«Â« it was not known at the time what dis
position the Insanity Commissioners had
made of her case.
SENATE CONSIDERS
THE SAMOAN TREATY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â The Senate in
executive session to-day discussed the 6a
moan treaty on the basis of the motion
of Senator Jones of Arkansas to reconsid
er the vote by which the treaty was rati
fied. Speeches were made in support of
the motion to reconsider by Jones, Pettl
grew, Allen and Money, and in opposition
by Davis and Foraker. At the conclu
sion of the debate a vote was ordered, but
a roll call disclosed the absence of a
quorum. Tho call, so far as it went,
snowed 11 for and 22 against.
Jones said that when the ratification of
the treaty took place it was the under
standing that there was to be no attempt
on the part of the Government of the
United States to establish a civil govern
ment on the island of Tutulla. The very
next day after the vote of ratification the
newspapers had published a very positive
statement in exact opposition to this un
derstanding. Apparently this statement
was authorized. It was to inquire Into
this and other matters that he had asked
for reconsideration.
Davis, sneaking in behalf of the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, said he know
of no change in the situation, and he still
contended that the authority exercised in
the island by the United States singly
would not under the new arrangement
differ materially from the Joint protecto
rate under the tripartite agreement be
tween the United States, Great Britain
and Germany.
Pettlgrew called attention to the reports
of disaffection and dissatisfaction on the
part of Chief Mataafa toward the new
arrangement. Davis said he had no of
ficial information concerning Mataafa's
attitude, that he had heard nothing about
it beyond what he had seen in the news
papers, and that if the President had any
Information on the subject he had not
communicated it to him.

NEW YORK, Jan. 23.â The proposal to

terday we could see British shells burst
ing close to the Boer camp on the plateau
this side of Potgleter's Drift, but; the
camp still remains in position there to
day. We heard very heavy firing all this
morning. The bombardment here is slack,
but the Boer big gun on Mount Bulwana
is still firing."
KEEP BOEBS POSTED.
LONDON. Jan. 24.â A correspondent of
the Dally Chronicle at Sterkstroom, tele
graphing Monday, says: "Many Dutch
colonists, although ostensibly loyal, real
ly sympathize with the Boers and keep
them posted regarding all British move
ments. They discharge rockets and make
other probable signals to the enemy. A
general rising, however, is no longer
feared.

THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Fe-w Facts on the Same Subject,
We hear much nowadays about healta
foods and hygienic living, about Vegetari-
anism and many other fada alone tha
same line.
Restaurants may be found In tha large?
cities where no meat, pastry or coffee la
served and the food crank Is In his glory,
and arguments and theories galore- ad-
vanced to prove that meat was never in-
tended for human stomachs, and almost
make us believe that our sturdy ancestors
who lived four score years in robust
health on roast beef, pork and mutton
must have been grossly ignorant of tha
laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do
than formulate theories about tha food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind from bacon to acorns.
A healthy appetite and common sensa
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment In a
highly concentrated form and Is digested
and assimilated more quickly than vege-
tables and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject says:
"Nervous persons, people run down In
health and of low vitality should eat meat
and plenty of lt. If the digestion Is too
feeble at first lt may be easily corrected
by the regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal. Two of these ex-
cellent tablets taken after dinner will di-
gest several thousand grains of meat, eggs
or other animal food In three hours, and
no matter how weak the stomach may be,
no trouble will be experienced if a regu-
lar practice is made of using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets because they supply tha
pepsin and diastase necessary to perfect
digestion, and every form of Indigestion
will be overcome by their use.
That large class of people who com*
under the head of nervous dyspeptics-
should eat plenty of meat and Insure its
proper digestion by the dally use of a safe,
harmless digestive medicine like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets composed of the nat-
ural digestive principles, pepsin, diastase,
fruit acids and salts, which actually per-
form the work of digestion- Cheap ca-
thartic medicines masquerafilns under
the name of dyspepsia cures are useless
for Indigestion as they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia In all Its many forms Is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest food
and tho sensible way to solve tho rlddla
and cure tho dyspepsia Is to raaka dally
use at meal time of a preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which Is in-
dorsed by the medical profession and
known to contain active digestlva princi-
ples.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia.
Tablets at 50c for full treatment.

ance to Startle the Inmates of
the Prison.
Pr^rlal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAI-AEL, Jan. 23.â The ghost
which has so often heretofore stricken
terror Into the hearts of inmates of the
Marin County Jail has again made its
appearance and selected Antone Jason,
the H-year-old boy who Is serving sixty
days for criminal assault, as its present
victim.
Jailer Atchlpy was startled at mid
night by screams of terror coming from
the cell occupied by Jason. Atchley at
once rushed to the cell and found the
boy cowering in the corner, shivering as
If "he had received some severe nervous
shock. The only answer which Atchley
could elicit from the boy In answer to his
queries as to what had frightened him
was. "The dead Chinaman! The dead
Chinaman!"
Sheriff Taylor questioned the boy this
morning and was convinced of his sin
cerity, though doubting the existence of
the "spook." Jason will to-night occupy
another cell, as the authorities fear se

member her. and'lt is asserted that he gave

Special Dispatch to Tha CalL
JACKSON, Cal., Jan. 23.â A Jury to try
Dr. Giles for the murder of Mrs. Jennie
Darling at Butter Creek has been se
cured and ia composed of the following:
A. Frederick, A. Grainger, L. H. Jordan.
J. Holtz, W. A. Courtright, T. Llthgow,
H. C. Toop, T. K. Norman, Ezra Taylor,
George L. Thomas, W. E. Emslla and
Frank Tromp.
Under the rule of the court these men
are now under the charge of the Sheriff
and will be in his custody until the case
clo , s , C3 . a . n< L the y are discharged.
faheriff Gregory was the first witness
sworn, and after relating the arrest of
Dr. Giles he introduced certain instru
lr nts lS taken by him from defendant's
office. These instruments were admitted
in evidence and will be heard from later
when the physicians who held the post
mortem testify. The second witness was
Andrew Darling, husband of the de
ceased. While he charges Giles with
having caused the death of Mrs. Darling,
he admits that immediately after the
funeral he went to Folsom, as he says,
to see his children; that he did not re
turn until arrested and was brought back
by Sheriff Gregory, when he himself was
charged with killing his wife. The wit
ness also admitted that he did not notify
the Coroner to hold an inquest. He re-
Iterated the assertion that Giles took the
soiled clothes from deceased and asked
him to destroy them, promising to pay
the funeral expenses if the matter was
kept out of the courts, but he denied the
charge made on the streets that he
offered to take $150 to hush the matter
up. As a whole Darling's testimony did
not make a favorable Impression.
Mrs. Emma Perkins gave damaging
testimony. She is a near neighbor of the
Darlings and saw the deceased at her
home the day before her death, when she
was apparently in perfect health. Next
day Mrs. Perkins saw Mrs. Darling in
bed. Dr. Giles was present and said the
patient had neuralgia. In this she
was corroborated by Mrs. Jennie Baw
den, Myrtle Richmond and others. The
last named was there when the doctor
arrived and asked how Mrs. Darling was.
On being told she was dead he exclaimed
"Is that possible." After feeling her
pulse he tore off the clothing, but wit
ness did not think defendant excited.
W. L. Rose related a conversation he
had with the defendant on November 16
relating to the death of Mrs. Darling, in
which he says the doctor admitted using
belladonna and an Instrument.
Adjournment was taken until 10 o'clock
to-morrow, when the doctors who held
the post mortem will probably be put
on the stand. There has been some
comment on the fact that T. K. Norman
is one of the jurors while his brother.
Dr. Norman, will probably be an impor
tant witness, but in the examination of
Jurors there seemed to be no legal
ground for excusing him and neither
side exercised a peremptory challenge.
DETAILS OF THE
KLONDIKE FIRE
Further Reports on the
Dawson Losses.
SEATTLE. Wash.. Jan. 23.â Advices
from the north received to-day substanti
ate the report of a big lire at Dawson. It
occurred on January 11 and destroyed
buildings and merchandise to the value of
$400,000. The news comes by telegraph
from Dawson to Skaguay. The lire is
supposed to have originated from a de
fective flue. The flames burned about 400
feet along the principal street, laying in
ashes many of the costliest and most sub
stantial structures in the Klondike me
tropolis. The tire extended along First
street, from Sam Bonineld's saloon and
gambling house to Thomas Chisholm's
saloon, wiping out these two well known
landmarks and all intermediate buildings.
These included many saloons, restaurants,
opera-house, grocery and general stores
and branch of the Canadian Bank of Com
merce. There was no loss of life, but
very little of the contents of the buildings
were saved. A.I of the burned buildings
faced the Klondike River. : On the oppo
site side of the street and nearer the
walÂ»r front are located the big ware
houses of the transportation companies.
They escai>ed.
Judge Davis, a Montana man, sustained
the loss of the best log block in Dawson.
Its original cost was $50,000. There were,
however, frame structures erected at an
even greater cost. Nothing approaching
a reliable estimate as to the individual
losses can be obtained. Three of the most
handsomely furnished and heavily stocked
saloons in" the city were burned. The
opt ra-hfiuse property is said to have been
worth $?r>.'.Â«iO. as Klondike prices go. It
was a comparatively new building, erected
upon the ruins of the old opera-house,
which was burned about eighteen months
ago.
BEDDIXG, Jan. 23.â A terrible story has reached this city concerning
the discovery of the, body of Henry Ward in his cabin on Browns Creek, in
the wilds of Trinity ' County. The story, as received, is replete with ghastly
details concerning the feeding of house pets upon the flesh of their dead mas
ter, with whose body they were closed In the cabin. Ward lived miles away
from his nearest neighbors. His cat and dog always slept In the cabin with
him, and the supposition is that Ward died a natural death alone and unat
tended. Being unable to get out, the cat and dog satisfied their hunger upon
the flesh of the man. Walter Coombs first saw the grewsome sight.
There was no doubt of the identity of the grewsome feasters. Two horses
were found in the barn suffering from hunger and thirst. They had broken
the mangers in their efforts to get haj-, and had kicked out portions of the
eide of the barn endeavoring to get out.

efforts were directed toward saving the
oil tanks, where 1.500,000 gallons of oil was
stored. Every few minutes a case of oil
would explode and sheets of flame leaped
hundreds of feet in the air. For a time
a high wind prevailed, which spread the
burning oil over several acres and It
was with great difficulty that the firemen
saved other warehouses In the vicinity.
The fire burned fiercely all day and it
was late to-night before the lake of oil
had burned out.

MANILA. Jan. 23.-This letter, ad

counselor of Affulnaldo and his congress
in Philippine affairs:
Or.tlemen: Convinced that you will treat the
I'liltpi'ir.e qurslion with impartiality, and with
the cbiect that the public opinion of a free and

The rVipirsoji continue to fight against tne
Americans, not because cf hatred, bat to
demonstrate th3t. far from looking with In

how to sacrifice themselves fur a government
which assures Individual liberties and Is ad
rrlnlEtered In conformity with the necessities

The present Ftate of war coes not perm.t
people to clve frank expression to a manifesta
tion of their aspirations. For this reason lha
riirir.o* wlFh ardently that the Congress of
the United fc-tates shall hear them before de

To this end the Filipinos a*k Conpren* either
to nominate a civil commission which may

In order to express th*> desire of the DeoDle.
I hope confidently that when Americans bti<l

the present conflict cease, but other future

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â Again to-day
the Senate's session was devoted entirely
to speechmaklng. Turner of Washington
concluded his address upon the Philip
pine question. He was followed by Ross
of Vermont with a thoughtful and care
fully prepared speech, in which he also
discussed the Philippine question In con
nection with resolutions which he had
offered. His presentation of the question
was given thoughtful attention by his col
leagues. McEnery of Louisiana delivered
the concluding speech of the session on
the race question In the South. He took
strong grounds In support of the constitu
tion of Louisiana and of the proposed
amendment of the North Carolina consti
tution, which It Is alleged will disfran
chise a largo class of voters.
Kyle of South Dakota offered and se
cured the adoption of a resolution direct
ing the Commissioner of Labor to investi
gate the effect upon labor, production and
wages of the International copyright act
and report to the Senate.
Pettigrow of South Dakota offered a
resolution calling upon the President to
send to the Senate the report of General
J. jC. Bates relating to the treaty with the
Sultan of Sulu. The resolution asked the
salaries to be paid the Sultan and his
officials, from what fund they were to be
paid, what services the officials performed
and whether these officers were under the
civil service. Objection was made and
the resolution went over.
Caffery then presented three resolutions
calling upon the President for correspond
ence with Great Britain concerning the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, the correspond
ence with the Colombian Government as
to the Panama canal and the correspond
ence with the new Panama Canal Com
pany of France. The resolutions were
adopted.
The resolution offered yesterday by Al
len of Nebraska calling upon the Secre
tary of the Treasury for correspondence
and the substance of all verbal communi
cations which he has had with officials of
the National City Bank of New York con
cerning the transfer of tho old custom
house to tho National City Bank was
adopted.
Turner of Washington concluded his
speech on the Philippine question begun
yesterday and then Ross of Vermont ad
dressed the Senate on the Philippine ques
tion. The text of his argument was a
resolution presented by him several days
ago declaring that the provisions of the
constitution do not, unaided by act of
Congress, extend over Porto Rico and the
Philippines; that the United States take
sovereignty over Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines unrestrained by the provisions of
the constitution and that the successful
discharge of this duty demands the estab
lishment of a separate department of the
Government to take charge of all outlying
dependencies of the United States and
the passage of a law making appoint
ments therein non-political. â¢
Ross's speech was essentially a legal
and constitutional discussion of the sev
eral questions raised. It was his first
speech of importance since he entered the
Senate and was listened to with great
Interest by the members.
After some routine business McEnery
addressed the Senate. While McEnery
was speaking he was interrupted by But
ler of North Carolina, who inquired
whether McEnery, when the amendment
to the Louisiana constitution, similar to
that now pending in Xorth Carolina, was
under consideration did not pronounce it
unconstitutional.
McEnery replied that he had pro
nounced it unconstitutional, but inas
much as it was adopted he had said that
he would support it In the Senate. He felt
it his duty to his constituents to do so
and he would always be found supporting
the laws and constitution of both his
State and his country. Referring to the
Viliplno insurrection in this connection
he said:
I don't etop to Inquire now whether my coun
try in the Philippines la right or not; I don't
Inquire who Bred the fir?t shot which precipi
tated hostilities. It Is enouph for me to know
that my Government has been assailed, and I
will urhold Its hands until its enemies are
broujjht into subjection.
Butler then read copies of letters writ
ten by McEnery in which he declared the
amendment to the Louisiana constitution
was "grossly unconstitutional"' and that
it was so regarded by the ablest consti
tutional lawyers in the Senate.
Â¦\Vhon McEnery had concluded Tlllman
of South Carolina called up a bill to re
vive and amend an act to provide for the
collection of abandoned property and the
prevention of frauds in insurrectionary
districts within the United States. Till
man asked Davis to make an explanation
of the measure. Davis said the claims
were not only just but it was the bounden
duty of Congress to provide for their pay
ment. In answer to an Inquiry from Hale
Davis replied that the claims covered cap
tured and abandoned cotton. Hale said:
"Why. that will amount to 5?0,000.000 or
J100.000.000."
To this Davis dissented, saying that un
der court decisions the claims for cap
tured and abandoned cotton would aggre
gate about $9,000,000. This money is in the
treasury and had been held by the United
States for twenty years for those to whom
the courts had adjudged it to belong.
Davis said that the payment of the claims
was as clear an act of justice as ever
was presented.
"The bill is not," said he, "a sluiceway
for the payment of all the claims which
have been referred to by Hale."
The bill was objected to and It went
over.
The Senate then, at 4:43 p. m.. went Into
executive session and at 5:30 adjourned.

WOMEN'S COLLEGE
TO BE STARTED
Plans for Institution at
Pasadena.
Special Dlsratch to The CalL.
PASADENA. Jan. 23.-After many year*
of planning and enthusing Principal C.
C. Bragden of La Salle Seminary, who
each winter brings hi 3 family to this city
from the East, has placed on a firm basin
his scheme for the establishment m tn.a
city of a first-class college for women.
A meeting of those Interested was held
yesterday and it was decided to petition
the Secretary of State lor a charter for
the kir.d of college proposed. Hie com
mittee chosen to do this consists of A. Â±w
Metcalfe. attorney: Miss Anna Orton.
principal of the Classical School for Girls,
and City Trustee Thomas C. Hoag.
The college is to be called "Pasadena
College for Women" and will be entirely
undenominational and non-sectarian. Tne
control will be vested In a board of fifteen
trustees, three of whom shall be changed
each year. A gift of seventy-five acre^
of land to be deeded when the college has
bn endowment of $300.000. has already been
made and the promoters are very hoperul
of success. They think that the neces
sary funds will be forthcoming. Princi
pal Bragden, who is now here, says:
"My hope is that this college will offer
a plan of training for women which shall
b # - unique in all the world and shall edu
cate women as women and not as men.
In the full light of the new demands ot
the new day education for women should
bring into prominence the humanities and
should in all respects consider first tha
value for the sex in all branches and
methods of culture."

CECILE HARDY.
CECILE HARDY, a sister of Rose Adler, or Rose "Relda." who is now
singing at the Opera Comique in Paris, has returned to San Francisco,
her native city, after an extended absence abroad. She was formerly
well known here as Cecilia Adler Keesing, and her magnificent soprano
voice was often heard at charity events and social functions.
After deciding to devote herself to music she went to the Royal Con
servatory of Music at Munich, where she graduated after studying under Her
mann Levi. the renowned Wagnerian conductor. Her first operatic appear
ance was in "Parsifal" at a great music festival at Bayreuth, when she ap
peared with such distinguished artists as Theresa Molten. Mme. Materna and
Herren Vogel, Hermann and Reichmann. She was also one of the soprano
singers of the Frankfort opera. Shortly afterward she was married and de
cided to leave the stage.
At a promenade concert in Queen's Hall. London, however, she was heard
by Henry Savage, the managing director of the Castle Square Opera Com
pany, and at his solicitation she consented to come to New York last sum
mer, where she sang during the grand opera season at the American The
ater. She made her debut as Eva in "Die Meistersinger," and afterward sang
Venus In "Tannhauser." Elsa In "Lohengrin," Annette in "Die Freiechutz'
and Michela in "Carmen."
She will be heard next Monday e,vening at Sherman & Clay Hall, when
she will be the vocalist at a chamber concert given the Henry Holmes
Quartet.
HOP SING TONG
WILL NOT HAVE
PEACE RESTORED
Spilling of Blood Is
Again in Order.
?
SLAVE'S ARRESTCAUSES HITCH
?
TONGS WILL NOT FUBNISH IN
FORMATION TO POLICE.
Highbinders on Whose Heads Prices
Have Been Placed Are Again
Seeking Places of Se
clusion.
Negotiations for peace have been called
ofT in Chinatown. The Hop Sing Tong
has positively refused to consent to any
amicable settlement until the assassina
tion of a number of their members has
been compromised in blood, and all ef
forts of the police, Chinese Consul Gen
eral, Merchants" Association and Six
Companies to arrange things otherwise
have been for naught.
According to leading tong men a
strange hitch came in proceedings of
peace yesterday. A merchant named
Wong Yong, who was delegated to con
vey the contract, already signed by the
Suey Sing Tong, to Wong Shi Shu for
his approval, had reached his destina
tion and was making arrangements for
a meeting with the president of the Hop
Sing Tong. Monday night, it is claimed,
a woman with whom he has been living
was arrested as a slave girl and turned
over to the custody of the United States
Marshal. When the news of the transac
tion reached Wong long yesterday he
became so enraged that he cast his com
mission aside and refused to take any
more action in the affair. The peace
makers had relied much upon the influ
ence of the merchant to accomplish the
restoration of peace, and when he for
sook his task they gave up all hope.
The signing of the compact which Act
ing Chief Biggy desired the highbinders
to make, calling for perpetual peace has
also been classed with the impossible.
The tongs refuse to give up the names
and addresses of their leaders and claim
that they will defy law and order as often
as they find the occasion and opportunity.
Chinese who have been identified with
the highbinder organizations and who
have learned during the lull in hostilities
that prices had been placed on their
heads were active last night. They ap
parently realized the hopelessness of the
situation and thousands of handbills were
scattered broadcast by them declaring
that they have ceased to exist as members
of the warring tongs and have no connec
tion with them whatever.
Trouble may again break out at any
time, but it is not expected immediately.
Police restrictions are at present so rigid
that the highbinders fear to ply their
trades and no more murders may be com
mitted until after the new year, which
begins on the 29th day of the presont
month. - ; .
Acting Chief Biggy has declared that if
some compromise is not made soon he
will enforce more stringent measures than
he has invoked up to the present time.
During the New Year festivities he
threatened to refuse to allow Chinamen to
congregate on the streets.
Wong Shi Shu. the Hop Sing Tong pres
ident, departed from Marysville yesterday
for St. Helena and the police will attempt
to catch him at that place.
Ing Dong, a Chinese suspected of being
a leading member of the Hop Sing Tong
society of highbinders, was arrested last
night by the Chinese squad and incarcer
ated In the "tanks" at the City Prison.
Dr. Gardner, the United States Chinese
Interpreter, was sent for and had a long
talk with the suspect, who claims to be
a JacksonÂ»street merchant. He refused
to discuss the highbinder proposition and
will be held pending an investigation.

JOSEPH E. GILLIGAN'. alias Harry
Howard, Is a recent Importation
from Colorado and apparently a
very undÂ«Â»sirable one. He ha.d been
here only a few months when he se
cured a position as waiter In the
Park Hotel, Twenty-fourth and Mission
Ftreets. and one afternoon went through
ten of the rooms, stealing a considerable
quantity of wearing- apparel, jewelry and
anything eipe that was handy. He car
ried the articles to a. lodging house at
Eighth and Jes-sle streets, where they
w*Â»rÂ«* found by Detectives Fitzg^raJ-1 and
<!ra!iam. He was arrested on April 30
last and got six months in the County
Jail.
Rwvntly Gillipan. alias Howard, got a
position as cook In the Capital restaurant,

About a wÂ»ek at;o he broke into the res
taurant and stole several articles. Early
v*>sterday morning he paiif another visit
ti th<Â» r^i-Taurant. He was walking along
Â«Â«rant avrnuc Â¦with two bundles under his
inns and at Geary street passed Police
men Hurd and Snowball. This was short
ly before 6 oVinc-k. Hurd became sus
p;rlous and stopped him. The bundles
vere opened and they contained two
boxes of cigars, a bundle of laundry, a
I'otTle of W-er. a case, of deviled ham and
nn oyster opener. GllHgan's answers to
Hurds questions were not satisfactory,
but to back up his assertions he asked
Hurd to accompany him to his landlady
at s* l ? Jones street. When they got there
the landlady said that Gilligan and a man
named Campbell had occupied a room.

SOCIALISTS AS ACTORS.
Will Appear in "The Weaver" With
Herr Most Sunday Night.
The socialists of the city, assisted by
Herr Most and some of the members of
the German stock company, will shortly
venture the production of Gerard Haupt
mann's socialistic play, "The Weaver."
The production has two objects in view:
the propagation In a new way of the so
cialist's creed and a matter of benefit for
Herr Most, who just now is in San Fran
cisco and In need of money.
The play deals with an upheaval of the
weavers of Silesia, a province of Ger
many, and it is based on an actual oc
currence of the year 1844. The weavers
strike for more money, they destroy the
house and property of the tyrannical em
ployer and his cashier and then the mili
tary Is called in to suppress the riot. The
play ends with the defeat of the work-

"The old-fashioned coffee always
made me heavy and dull and gave me
heartburn, with dyspepsia. When we
tried Postum, Food Coffee, it did not
taste good, but I begged for another
trial, when the directions were fol-
lowed, and we found it delicious. Since
that time we. have used it regularly,
and I never have any trouble with the
heavy feeling or dyspepsia.
"Dr. Lowrie prescribed Postum for
my uncle. Mr. . property man of
the Boston Theater, and it worked a
marvf-luus change in him. He quit
thÂ«Â» common coffee, and has been using
Postum Food Coffee ever since. He

ACTIVE SERVICE
Home Battalion Plan
to Be Applied.
INCREASING COAST GARRISONS
USING THE MEN UNFIT FOB
HARD CAMPAIGNING.
More Men Wanted for the Hospital
Service Here and in Manila.
Preparing for the
DÂ«ad.
Reports that there would be an Increase
of the garrison at the Presidio have some
chance of being realised before long.
General Shafter has asked that "home
battalions" from three regiments now in
the Philippines be sent to this depart
ment to be distributed among the posts
on this coast.
The home battalions askM for arÂ« from
the Fourteenth, Eighteenth and Twenty
third Infantry regiments. This does nut
mean, however, that one organized bat
talion will be taken from each regim:-nt
and sent back to this country. A full
battalion of four companies will be sent,
but the four companies will be made up
*'f men of the r^gim^nis who are un
fitted for active service. Th^re are many
In the hospitals and there are many more
discharged from the hospitals In the
Philippine! 5 who are only nominally fit
for the Island service. If these men
could be pent home they would make
pood soldiers under the genial Influence
of thT; home climate, so It Is the Intention
to form the four companies of the home
battaJion of just Euch men. Four com
panies of cmali available membership
will be picked out, and all the able
bodied men on their rolls â¢will be trans
ferred to fill vacancies In other com
panies, and all unavailable men In the
other companies will be transferred to
the four to make up the home battalion.
In this v.ay eight 'â¢able-bodied" com
panies will remain on the field and four
companies composed of men fit for home
duty if not for campaigning will return.
Those who do not recuperate will be dis
charged, and the home battalion will be
recruited up from the general recruiting
service.
The home battalion ' of the Twenty
third will in all probability be assigned
to the Presidio, as the post commander.
Lieutenant Colonel EsKridge, is of the
Twenty-third Infantry. A second home
battalion will be assigned to Vancouver
Barracks, and the third will either be
distributed among the coast ports or it
will be Bent to Alaska to swell the troops
in the new department to be commanded
by General Randall.
The Introduction of a home battalion at
the Presidio will solve another problem
that is being worked out at the post. For
some time past a company of convales
cents has been under process of forma
tion. Its strength being drawn from men
discharged from the hospital as convales
cent, but who. nevertheless, are unlit to
bo returned to the rigors of a service to
which they once succumbed. There are
now thirty-two men In the convalescent
company, and they represent every
organization, regular and volunteer, in
the Philippines. They cannot be lettered
or numbered, for, as a whole, they belong
to no regiment and no company, but
when the home battalion is brought to
the post these men will be transferred
to it and will be carried on the regi
mental rolls without further complica
tion.
The home battalion system has been
applied to all the regiments in Cuba and
has been found to work with satisfac
tion.
The medical department is after more
hospital corps men to respond to the In
creasing demand from the hospital
service In Manila. It is the Intention to
enlist at least fifty more for the island
service as soon as they can be found.

Officer, Dr. O'Brien:

but were ordered out Sunday, as they
could not pay the rent. Hurd then started
with Gilligan for the City Prison. At
I^eavenworth and Ellis streets the pris
oner broke away and ran. Hurd called
upon him to stop. He kept running and
Hurd pulled out his revolver and fired
four shots over the fugitive's head, think
ing to scare him into stopping. It had the
opposite effect. Gilligan soon disappeared
into a lodging house on the northwest
corner of Turk and Hyde streets.
The report of the shots brought Police
men P. Burns and Joy on the scene, and
while Hurd kept watch outside Burns and
Joy searched the lodging house. Burns
found Gilligan hiding In a room on the
top flat.- He was taken to the prison and
locked up in/ "the tanks." Later, when
the restaurant man identified the arti
cles. Gilligan was booked on a charge of
burglary. He had effected an entrance
into the restaurant by forcing open tho
rear window. ,
A charge of forgery was also booked
against Gilligan. Last Friday he went to
T. J. Clancy, saloon-keeper, 222 McAllis
ter street, with a chock for $12 on the
First National Bank, purporting to be
signed by John T. Sullivan, proprietor of
the Oriel Hotel on Market street. He toM
Clancy that he had been employed as a
waiter at the Oriel and Sullivan had given
him the check. He got the money. Clancy
sent tho check to the bank and found that
the signature was a forgery. When Gilli
gan was searched at the prison a number
of blank checks of the First National
Bank wore found in his pocketi.
a bank or at any other place must ber
presented for payment at the place
named. When no place is specified tha
note is payable at the maker's place o*
business or at his residence. The nott*
must not be presented before- or after
maturity, but upon the exact day of ma
turity, if the lniiorsers are to be held lia
ble for its non-payment.
When a note is presented, for payment;
at maturity :ind is not paid it is usually
protested; that is, a notary public makf*
a formal statement that thÂ» note wa*
presented for payment und payment wai
refused. Notice of such protest 13 sent to
the n.aker and to each indorser.
If ii payment Is made to apply on n
note, such payment should always be in
dorsed on the back of the note. Such in
dorsement requires no signature. Tha
usual form is to give the date and wrt:<s
"Received on within note." stating thiÂ»
amount. An ordinary separate receipt ia
not sufficient. Each amount indorsed onÂ»
the back reduces the fa^e value.
It is generally understood that a debtor
is? nwr â¢ UKtriy to pay a promissory r.ota
than he Is to keep a simple verbal prom
ise. It will injure his credit if he alluw.t
his paper to go to protest. It is difficult,
too, to dispute a claim after a note haJ
been given in settlement. The note may
be used by the creditor in raisins money
for his own use; that Is, he may get it
discounted â sell It to a note broker or to
a bank. But there are some disadvan
tages. If a note is accepted from a debtor
the account cannot be collected until tha
day of maturity of th<Â» note. You may
hold a note against a debtor, and if your
note is not due you cannot by any process
of law prevent your debtor from selling
everything he owns and leaving for parts
unknown. A note that is overdue is in
some particulars better than a note not
yet matured. An overdue note draws in
terest at the legal rate from the date of
maturity, and legal steps to collect it may
be taken at any moment.
To discount a note or draft is to sell it
at a discount. The rates of discount vary
according to the security offered, or th*
character of the loan, or the state of tlra
money market. For ordinary commercial
paper the rates run from 4 to 8 per ceru.
Notes received and given by commercial
houses are not usually for a longer period
than four months.
Negotiable paper, whether madÂ« for ac
commodation or otherwise, may be trans
ferred by indorsement and delivery or by
delivery alone, either before it has fallen
due or afterward. There is a difference,
however, in the liability attached to hi
dorsers, and the value of the paper may
be affected by the defenses Â»xi--sting be
tween the original parties. It would be>
well to consult a lawyer before accepting
overdue paper, particularly if it* has in
dorsers.
A Judgment Note.
Some of the States, noticeably Pennsyl
vania, have a form of promissory not*
called a Judgment note. In th'Â« farm t>Â£
note the maker confesses judgment if thfÂ»
note Is not paid and authorizes the court
to take possession of sufficient of hla
property immediately to satisfy tha
amount of the claim. It is really a very
severe form of contract and should ba
given only under the most extreme condi
tions.
Certificate of Deposit.
If you deposit money temporarily In a
bank for safekeeping you will receiv* a.
receipt therefor. The receipt is usually
called a certificate of dfposic It often
occurs that such certificate is used in
stead of a bank draft in the payment of
distant bills. Interest is allowed under
certain conditions. It is practically a.
bank's check on itself. In issuing certifi
cates of deposit to strangers the bank:
should take their signatures upon thÂ«
margin of the certificate book, so that
when the certificates come home for re
demption the Indorsements may bo com
pared with the original signatures. If It
seems necessary. Of course every prop
erly managed bank has a ledger account
of certificates of deposit Issued, which Is
a full record of the amounts and names
of all certificates issued, together with
their dates and numbe-s. Returning cer
tificates can be compared with th'.s record
as they are presented for payment through*
clearing-houses and over the counter.

VI. SOME LAW POINTS FOR
GIRLS.
Promissory Notes.
Have nothing whatever to do with
promissory notes. This 19 perhaps the
best advice which can be given to girls
and women, but this does not mean tiiat
you are to know nothing whatever aoout
promissory notes.
A promissory note is a written promise
to pay a definite sum of money. Any such
promise is really a promissory note. At
the time when such promise is written
there are two parties connected with Itâ
the one who makes the promise and the
one to whom the money is to be pail.
"1 promise to pay Charles Brown $10.
(Signed) John Smith./' This Is a. prom
issory note. John Smith is the maker and
Charles Brown la the payee, that is. the
person to whom the money is to be paid.
J&uch a promise should be dated and it
should state also when the money is to he
paidâ in one month or in three months or
on demand. If Charles Brown wanted to
turn this note over to his grocer in pay
ment of a bill he ought to have had it
worded differently; it should read, "I
promise to pay to the order of Charles
Brown": that is, John Smith will pay the
$10 to Charles Brown or to the baker or
grocer or anybody Charles Brown "or
ders" it paid to. The note is then "ne
gotiable." "Negotiable" means "trans
ferable." All United States bills are ne
gotiable. They read, "the United States
will pay bearer"; that is. will pay any
body bearing or holding the bills. A note
may be written on any kind of paper, m
Ink or in pencil. -
The words "value received" are not le
gally necessary, although they usually
appear on ordinary promissory not*-*.
Thousands of good notes made without
any value consideration are handled
daily. The promise to pay of a negotia
ble note must be unconditional. It cannot
be made to depend upon any contingency
whatever. A note made payable in any
thing but money Is simply a form of con
tract and is not a negotiable instrument.
NotPs and acceptances that are made in
settlement of genuine business transac
tions come under the head of regular legit
imate business paper. An accommodation
note or acceptance is one which is signed,
or indorsed or accepted, simply as an ac
commodation and not in settlement of an
a'ceount or in payment of an Indebtedness.
"With banks accommodation paper has a
deservedly hard reputation. However,
there are'all grades and shades of accom
modation paper, though it represents no
actual business transaction between the
parties to it, and rests upon no other
foundation than that of mutual agree
ment. No contract Is good without a
consideration, but this Is only true be
tween the original parties to a note. Ihe
third party, or innocent receiver or holder
of a note, has a good title and can re
cover its value, even though It was orig
inally given without a valuable consid
eration. An innocent holder of a note
which had been originally lost or stolen
has a good title to it if he received it for
A note does not draw Interest until after
maturity, unless the words "with Inter
est" appear on the face. Notes draw In
terest after maturity and until paid at
the legal rate.
An indorser of a note is any person who
writes his name on the back of It. and by
so doing guarantees Its payment, in
dorsements on notes are usually made in
blank that is, without the words of "pay
to the order of." The receiver or the note
is then free to Indorse it or not. at his
pleasure, if he wishes to transfer It. The
indorser Is liable for Its payment if the
maker fails to meet It. If an Indorser
should be compelled to pay a note he has
a good claim against the maker and
against each Indorser whose name ap
pears above his own. An Indorser to
whose order a note Is drawn or Indorsed
can transfer it without becoming liable
for Its payment by writing the words
"without recourse* before or after his
name on the back. A person who receives
a promissory note In good faith for fair
value before the day oi maturity takes
It freo from all defects of title and from
all claims that might be set up
aeainst any preceding holder. This Is not
true of notes transferred after maturity
A note should be presented on the exact
day of maturity. Notes made payable at

WHEELER IS THE CHAIRMAN
SIXTY PROMINENT BUSINESS
MEN TO WORK.
Plan of Organization Will Be Con
sidered by Ten Whoss Views Will
Be Submitted to Members
Before Next Meeting.
The first practical steps toward the cre
ation of a commercial museum, were tak
en last night at a largely attended meet
ing in the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.
Delegates from the organizations that
united in the call for the meeting consti
tuted themselves a committee of promo-*
tlon and elected President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler permanent chairman and Pro
fessor Plehn permanent secretary. The
chairman was authorized to appoint a
committee of ten to consider all plans
submitted for the organization of the
museum, the committee to send printed
reports of its conclusions to all members
of the committee of promotion, and after
the reports have been considered individ
ually, the committee of promotion will be
called together to consider finally and
make up a plan for the museum.
Only two names were mentioned for the
chairmanship of the committee on promo
tion, those of Benjamin Ide Wheeler and
M. H. de Young. Mr. de Young declined
to be considered a candidate for the posi
tion. The committee on promotion con

President Wheeler opened the meeting
last night with an address in which he
dwelt upon the enlargement of the com
mercial opportunities of the Pacific Coast
and the atlvlsiblllty of concerted action to
reap all the benefits that might accrue.
Commerce and trade had become scien
tific, he said, and the merchant must do
as the scientific man has done, collect his
facts and then come to conclusions. The
day of the rule of thumb had passed, he
continued.'; Germany had taken the lead i
in commerce in ten years, and all because I
facts had been accumulated and carefully ,
studied by her men of business and af
fairs. The people of the Pacific Coaat had
awakened to the new conditions. No
man, he said, could be blind to the glit
tering future of the Pacific Coast com
mercially. San Francisco must act unit
edly and forget' the tradition that It was
every man for himself to. win success.
V. W. Dohrmann nominated Ernest A.
Denicke for chairman of the meeting.
Colonel Denlcke declined and suggested j
the name of President Wheeler, saying j
that It was at his Instance that the meet-
Ing to consider the museum had been
called. President Wheeler was then elect- !
ed chairman. i
M. H. de Young submitted a resolution â¢
proposing that all persons invited and
actually present at the meeting should
be made a committee on promotion; that
such committee should elect a president,
vice president, treasurer and secretary;
that the committee should name a com
mittee on finance to consist of sixty citi
zens, the members of the promotion com
mittee to be members ex officio; that the
finance committee should elect an execu- j
tive committee of the finance committee
of nine members, this sub-committee to
meet daily to arrange details, receive re
ports and fill vacancies in the working
committees: also to canvass the State and
city to secure donations and subscriptions
and also to make a rough canvass of the
city for members. The promotion com- |
mlttee under the plan was to elect all I
officers and boards provided for in a
scheme of organization when sufficient
money had been raised to insure the In
auguration of the museum and members
enough had signed to provide funds for
its maintenance.
Before this resolution was considered
statements were made by Professor Plehn
and Professor George Davidson concern-
Ing the Philadelphia museum, and also
concerning the trade of the countries of
the Pacific. Professor Plehn urged that
the first manager of the museum should
be from Philadelphia, that experience
might be available from the first. Profes
sor Davidson said that of the vast traffic
of the Pacific, which amounted to $2,140,
000,000, California got only 7 per cent,
whereas the amount ought to be in
creased to a quarter of the total.
W. 11. Mills was not In favor of proceed
ing to permanent organization at once.
Isaac Upham offered a resolution that
the chairman should appoint a committee
to prepare a plan for organization. M. H.
de Young said that the meeting was called
to organize, and he was In favor of imme
diate action.
Arthur Rodgers offered a resolution to
authorize the chair to name a committee
of ten to prepare a plan of organization
of the museum and for its maintenance.
The first part of Mr. de Young's resolution
was adopted, providing for the committee
on promotion.
Arthur Rodgers' resolution was finally
adopted. The chairman and the. secretary
were made members of the committee on
promotion. A. resolution was read pledg
ing the support of the Public Improve
ment Club.

CHICAGO. Jan. 23â May wheat opened V4@%c
under yesterday's close, at 66%'Q'66 1 ,4 c, actuated
by an initial decline at Liverpool of %d. The
dip was only momentary as the English market
steadied early and Paris showed another ad
vance. Trade was active, foreigners and in
fluential locals were good buyers and profes
sional traders covered lines let out early. May
advanced to 67c, where for some time the mar
ket ruled firm, but rather dull. Later a spasm
of profit-taking depressed the price of May to
6S*s@66 I ,ic, but a shaxp recovery followed aÂ»
outside markets were firm, primary receipts
light and clearances liberal. The Northwest
was a good buyer at this stage of the session.
May advanced to 67@67Vic and closed strong.
Â»ic over yesterday at 67c. On the advance trade
was acalu lairly active.
Corn was dull throughout the session and In
clinid to be heavy, but the strength of wheat
had a steadying effect and near the end in
fluenced ei.uugh buying to result in a gain over
last nlxht. May closed HIJUo up at 33Vic.
The trade in oats was llf;ht and the tone
generally weak, but the strength of wheat
boosted the market near the close to a level
with yesterday's linal iigurea. May closed un
changed at 23\4c.
With receipts of hogs under the estimate the
weaknÂ«s cf provisions was particularly dis
appointing to the bulls. May pork closed 2>.<.

Oakland Office San Francisco, Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 23.
THE secret marriage of Lulu
Xoye, stepdaughter of Craigie
Sharp, secretary of the Oak
land Board of Trade, and
Leigh H. Robins, a young
bookkeeper employed at J. H. McDon
ald's real estate office, leaked out to
night.
The news will be received as a great
surprise by Oakland society. The fact
of their marriage has been guarded
with the most remarkable and strict
est secrecy for over two years, not
even the parents of the young couple
having ever had the slightest Inkling
until to-day, when the bride gently
broke the news to her mother.
The couple have never lived to
gether as man and wife, and but for
the fact that the young platonic hus
band had of late been posing in the
Bwellest of local society as a single
manâ a pose that apparently aroused
the Ire of the neglected brideâ the de
tails of the elopement would have
continued in its cloak of secrecy for
ever and anon. The elopement was
arranged by telephone.
The truth of Lulu N'oye's story as
told by her to her mother to-day Is
clearly borne out by the marriage rec
ords of Santa Clara County. The rec
ords there show that on August 21,
1537, at San Jose, a license was issued
by Deputy County Clerk J. M. Shllue
to Leigh H. Robins, a native of Vir
ginia, resident of San Francisco, aged
21 years, and Lulu Noe. native of Cal
ifornia, resident of San Francisco, aged
18 years. It will be seen that the true
place of residence (Oakland) was not
given, nor was the bride's name cor
rectly spelled. The marriage was
solemnized at San Jcse on the same
day by L. Delos Mansfield, minister of
the Protestant Episcopal Church
there, the witnesses being Efizabeth
M. and Jennette Mansfield, wife and
daughter-in-law respectively of the
officiating pastor. Two days later the
marriage was recorded.
After the ceremony the young bride
and groom hurried back to their re
spective homes in this city and a vow
was taken never to divulge their se
cret. Since then Mr. Robins has oc
casionally called on his wife at the
home of her parents, 7IS Sycamore
street, but he claims that he has been
too busy with other and more Impor
tant affairs to find time to discuss
with his bride the fact of their mar
riage, the prospect of settling down
TRYING TO ESTABLISH
HIRAM ROGERS' DEATH
HIS STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE
IS RECALLED.
Insurance Company Now Contesting
His Widow's Suit Instituted to
Recover on a Policy Held
by Him.
Mrs. Maria T.Rogers appeared in Judga
Hunt's court yesterday morning to press
her suit against the Manhattan Life In
surance Company brought to recover
$5000 on a policy upon her husband's life,
who mysteriously disappeared while on
a voyage from this city to Port Harford
aboard the steamer Santa Rosa. Hiram
K. Rogers Is the name of the alleged de
cedent. He left this city on June 9. 1597.
He was seen aboard the steamer on the
night of the 9th, and was very despond
ent. The following morning his statf
room door was found open, a coat and
hat were on the deck where. It is sup
posed, he left them, and a note ad
dressed to the captain told of his in
tention to throw himself overboard.
His death by drowning was reported
by the captain of the vessel on arriving
in port and the news was telegraphed
Mrs. Rogers. Mrs. Rogers employed a
local detective agency to clear up tho
mystery, ssid after searching for the
missing man for several months without
success notices were posted throughout
the country containing his description
and the facts relating to his disappear
ance. In the circular it was stated that
Rogers left his home June 9. 1Â»97. and
took passage on the steamer Santa Rosa
for Port Harford. On the arrival of th*
steamer at Port Harford Rogers was
missed. "Any information regarding hia
whereabouts," the circular continued,
"would relieve- the terrible strain from
the minds of his distressed family." No
news of his whereabouts was ever re
ceived and a few months ago suit was
filed to recover on the policy. The in
surance company filed answer In which it
was denied that Rogers was dead, an<l
the case went to trial yesterday. Mrs.
Rogers was first called to the stand an-l
told her story regarding her parting with
her husband and her anguish at learning
that he was drowned. Mrs. Rogers broku
down on the stand and wept bitterly
when she went over the details of thÂ«
vain search for her husband. Her attor
neys next sought to Introduce the note
left by Rogers saying that he was golnt;
to throw himself overboard, but counsel
for the defense objected on the ground
that It in no way established the death
of the policy holder. Judge Hunt dis
missed the jury and counsel argued on
the admissibility of the note until the
hour of adjournment. Judge Hunt will
arive his opinion on the matter when tho
case 19 a train taker. \iv this morning.

SOS Broadway. Jan. 23.
Trembling in every limb. Joa^uin Es
laba, the murderer of Charles Gates, his
last hope gone, crouched in a cell in the
County Jail to-night and refused to see
anybody. Every shadow looks like a
scaffold to him.
Formerly ::.-'Â¦' i was phlegmatic.
N'ou he if filled with a nervous apprehen
sion. The Supreme Court has decided
that he must expiate his crime on the
gallows and all hope has been aban-
Goned. Bravado has bÂ«-en succeeded by
fear. He may walk to death like moft
men. but if lie does he will have to un
dergo a wonderful change. At present he
is broken down.
The crime of which Eslaba was con
victed was a mo?t brutal one. Two
years ago Charles Gates, a tamale
dealer in a basement store jit the corner
of Thirteenth street and Broadway, was
murdered. His h*ad was pounded to a
Jelly with a bludgeon, after which he had
been garroted.
A fraa!l amount of property was taken.
but it was not enough to convince the po
lica thst robber}- was the motive for tho
erirnÂ«Â». Investigation was thorough and
action w: - prompt. As a result Eslaba
was arrc-!?... d the day after the crime was
committed while he was en route to San
Krr.ncisoo on a f*rry-b<->at. On his person
vms found property belonging to the mur
dered man. A subsequent investigation
produced conclusive proof of the prullt of
the prisoner. An irref raglble chain ot
circumstantial evidence wa* forged
around him.
After a lone trial Eslaba was found
ruilty nf murder in the first degree, and
Jucge Ogd^n. who presided in the case,
KKtenced him to be hanÃÂ«?d. An appeal
was tnken. and yesterday the Supreme
<".nurt affirmed the finding of the lower
tribunal. When the prisoner was told
thst ail hope had disappeared he became
<***^pondent.
"H*lir* he remarked. Then he relapsed
Into silence.
A death watch has been placed on him.

"QUEEN'S LACE
HANDKERCHIEF"
The Comic Opera Situation.
Something of Mr. Jones'
Stage Management.
After a very pretentious but not too
successful production of "The Black Hus
sar" the Southwell Opera Company made
its first hit in San Francisco a year ago
with "The Queen's Lace Handkerchief."
And now that operetta is revived at the
Grand, with the same principals, an al
tered orchestra, a new chorus and a dif
ferent management. Comparison is inevi
table. The performance is not so good.
The reason for this is the next thing to
be considered. Is it due to the principals,
who are the same, the orchestra, which la
altered, the chorus, which is new, or the
management, which is different?
iir. Wolff is the same; Mr. Persse per
haps better than he was; Edith Mason's
voice has suffered an impairment, and
Miss Ladd has in every way deteriorated.
The orchestra is decidedly capable, though
its value la lessened by the loss of Mi.
Stmonson, who was an important factor
in all the Southwell productions. The
chorus is still so good that no serious
fault may be found with it.
It is therefore "up to" the management
to account for the falling off of. the cur
rent performance. It has simply kept the
singers too long In the harness and al
lowed some of them to sing their voices
isway utterly. The loss of blmonson, too,
was a mistake, though perhaps unavoid
able. It is now perhaps too late in the
day to mend matters and the company
must perforce remain as it is, weary and
unrelieved, until the end of its season,
which is not far distant. Had, however,
some new material been introduced in
the high places the public's interest in
the productions at the Grand would be
revivified to the advantage of all con
cerned.
"The Queen's Lace Handkerchief" is a
pleasing opera in any circumstances, and.
the present performance of it Is enjoy
able, decidedly so. The music is blithe
and catchy, and some of it, the ensembles
in particular, is being sung with good ef
fect. The linale of the second act is ad
mirable and simply compels the applause
that calls for its repetition.
The stage management Is as clever as is
all of Mr. Jones' work and more rationally
conducted than it was in "Don Caesar â¢
There is of course the inevitable formality
of his gToupinc, but it does not occur
where it should not, and there is plenty
of the proper kind of movement that does
r.ot suggest a checker-board stage and a
drillmaster in tho wings.
When there is a certain amount of seri
ous dramatic action in a comic opera the
chcrus and supes should be handled in a
manner that does not utterly destroy the
illusion. They should act with something
like a proper sense of the situation and
not malte things ridiculous by evoluting
in revolving stars and dissolving squares.
Mr. Jones, who is undoubtedly a man of
ideas, might take a leaf from tho book of
some grand opera stage managers and do
something deserving of the praise that is
due the handling of the Roman mob In
the American opera company's produc
tion of "Nero." He should not wait until
he is forced to break away from tradition,
as he was in Stewart and Robertson's
"His Majesty," and the success that the
clever management of the chorus in that
opera won should encourage him to adopt
the freer and infinitely more artistic tac
tics displayed therein.

ALLEGED VOID CONTRACT.
The "Webster-Street Bridge Matter
Brought Into the Federal Courts.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â R. Percy Wright
brought euit to-day in the United States
Circuit Court at San Francisco to restrain
the Board of Supervisors and other offi
cials of Alameda County from paying to
the Cotton Brothers Company a balance
of 132.000 alleged to be due that firm for
th* construction of the Webster street
bridge connecting Alameda and Oakland.
The complaint sets forth that Cotton
Brothers Company issued to the other
bidders on the contract blue prints in
which changes had been made; which
changes caused the competing bidders to
add about $6003 to the amounts of their
bids, thus giving Cotton Brothers the
advantage in the bidding by that amount.
A temporary restraining order was is
eued and the matter was set for hearing
on February 12. Mr. Wright is an attor
ney-at-law. The Federal courts have
jurisdiction because he is a subject of
Queen Victoria.

IMPROVEMENT CLUBS
FORWARD PETITIONS
Fire Protection, School Buildings
and Other Betterments
Sought.
With the expectation of getting Im
provements for their several localities the
various improvement clubs of the Mission
are active in the petition field to the new
city authorities. At the Nuevo Potrero
Club last night, John Bardhun in the
chair, the linal rrport of the committee
on better railroad service was presented
by the secretary. Attorney C. F. Kim
ball, who engineered to success the ad
ditional service of an electric line from
Twenty-fourth street to Rhode Island,
stated that the Market-street company
cheerfully granted what the club desired,
and as a result within thirty days from
the time the request was made the rails
had been put down over four blocks. This
report was hailed witS considerable Joy
by the club members, and a vote of
thanks was extended to Mr. Kimball for
his success.
President Bardhun drew the attention
of the members to the necessity of having
better fire protection in this portion of the
Mission. Acting on the suggestion, A. D.
Pratt made a motion that a committee of
three be appointed to wait on the Super
visors and request the erection of a build
ing for the purpose. The motion was
adopted and the chair appointed A. D.
Pratt. John Kidney and Charles Melrnet
to wait on the members of the board.
The next important matter looking to
the welfare of the "t'ction was the erec
tion of an eight-class school building. It

located on the side east of Potrero avenue
and west of De Haro street, with over 200
children, for whom there are no school
facilities. To obtain the necessary requi
site in this respect President Bardhun ap
pointed A. D. Pratt. Attorney C. F. Kim
ball and Peter Stolberg to wait on the
Board of Education and present a petition
setting forth the requirements of the resi
dents.

Niles Library Incorporates.
NILES. Jan. 22.â The people of Niles
Â¦will f-hnrtly enjoy the advantages of a
free public library. A number of citizens
have voluntarily associated thems^lv^s
together for the purpose of forming a cor
poration under the laws of the State to
establish and maintain such a library; to
buy. sell or exchange such real or per
sonal property as may be rÂ«"iuir*'d for the
use or benefit of the corporation: to re
ceive gifts of property, both real and per
sonal; to borrow money and give as se
curity therefor a note and mortgage on
any of the corporation's property.
To-day articles of incorporation were
filed with County Clerk Jordan by the
Niles Free Public Library. There is no
capital stock nor shares of stock, and tlie
trustees of the corporation are nam?d as
follows: Charles H. Shinn. Ernest South
wick. Julia Shinn. M. B. Sneden and Em
ily ChittiTidrn. all residents of Nile?.
to housekeeping an.l their future in
tentions. And Mr. Robins has always
continued to make his home at the
residence of his widowed mother,
Mrs. F. T. Robins, 520 Sycamore
street. Communication between bride
and groom has been chiefly by tele
phone.
The elder Mrs. Robins was loth to
discuss the affair when seen this even
ing. Craigie Sharp had called on her
to-day, exhibiting the marriage cer
tificate of his stepdaughter, and Mrs.
Robins was astounded beyond all con
ception.
"I was never so surprised in all my
life," she declared. "I knew nothing
of this affair and had no idea they
were even going together, for Leigh
has never to my recollection men
tioned Miss Noye's name in my pres
ence. I do not know what it all
means."
Young Mr. Robins, the retiring
groom, likewise was loth to express
himself affirmatively or negatively
until pressed, and then he whispered:
"Yes, we sneaked down to San Jose
at the time you mention and got mar
ried. You see, it was this way: Wo
were young and liked each other very
well and thought it might be nicely
romantic to go oft and get married
that way.
"I haven't given the subject any
further thought since then," continued
Robins, "for I've been too busy with
business affairs I don't know really
whether we will ever live together, for
1 don't know how her folks feel about
it. Most of our conversation on that
subject has been over the telephone.
But then I don't care to discuss it."
The young bride could not be seen
to-day, nor her mother, who Is re
puted to be wealthy. Mr. Sharp, how
ever, expressed his surprise over his
stepdaughter's marriage.
"I absolutely did not know anything
about it until Lulu told her mother
about it to-day. To say I was sur
prised and provoked is putting it
mildly. Of courÃe the proposition is
here. Mr. Robins will probably have
to provide for his wife now. He'll
have to do something or his young
bride will certainly be doing some
thing. He has not provided for her.
If it comes to a showdown she has
grounds for a divorce."
It is not improbable that young
Robins, who is decidedly popular in
society circles, may find himself a
candidate for defendant in a divorce
suit almost as soon as his friends have
realized that he is a benedict.
BEQUEATHED CARE OF
SONS TO DAUGHTERS
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â The will of Eliza
Teubert, who died at San Lorenzo on the
16th Instant, wns filed for probate to
day. The estate is valued at several thou
sand dollars and by the terms of the will,
dated Just a week prior to her death, is

nessed by Jemima Branln and N. A. Mc-
Conaghy, contains the following pro
vision: "My failure to mention or be
queath anything herein to my two sons,
Charles Herman and Thomas Armstrong
Teubert, is Intentional, as I believe said
sons will be properly cared for by my
two daughters named herein."
The daughters are named as executrices
without bonds and they apply for letters
of administration.

OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â August Schilling

mediately in the rear of Mr. Schilling:*
place and will make a very handsome ad
dition to his grounds. It is proposed to

grounds.
THEY LIVED AS
SON AND MOTHER
BUT FELL OUT
Now Widow Wants
Deeds Null.fied.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Jan. 23.
At the trial of a suit before Judge Ella
worth to-day, brought to nullify a deed, it
developed that at one time the plaintiff,
Christina Schobel, aged 71 years, acted as
mother over the defendant, August Welke,
aged 31 years. But ,the ageii German
woman claims that she 'found Welke
out" and immediately broke on" her pro
fessed maternal relations.
It appears that back in 1892 Mrs. Schobel
was employed as a domestic by the par
ents of W. B. Wegener in San Francisco.
She had some money left her by her hus
band, and with this she took a mortgage
on several lots in Lorin, eventually ac
quiring title by foreclosure. About four
years ago Welke, who had also been in
the employ of the Wegener family, be
came acquainted with the widow Schobel.
Presently the two went to Sonoma County
to reside and engaged in chicken ranch
ing. Mrs. Schobel had no relatives liv
ing and grew very fond of her partner,
whom she called "son," and who in af
fectionate response called her â¢"mother."
But one evil day, according to Mrs.
Schobel'B complaint, Welke induced her
to deed to him her. lots in Lorin, valued
at about $2000, and then she found out, so
she claims, that he has been trying to sell
the property. Therefore she seeks to set
uslde the gift.
On the witness etand Mrs. Schobel tes
tified that Welke had explained to her
that should she die the deed conveyance
could be promptly recorded and he be
saved the expenso of probating her estate.
Welke, on the other hand, claims that
the deed was a gift pure and simple as
could pass between a fond mother and a
loving son, and he declares that he will
fight the case to a bitter termination. He
asserts that the woman's assumed rela
tions as mother hnve waned and that she
therefore changed her mind and now
wants her property restored to her.
The trial was not concluded this after
noon, but was continued.
TRIUMPH OF AN

young Oakland artist, has returned home

TO VOTE BONDS
TO IMPROVE
THEIR CITY
More School Facilities
for Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 23.â The city of Ala
meda will have a chance to vote bonds to
the amount of $100,000 for Improvements.
The bond election will be held March 26,
two days after the freeholders' election.
It will then be left to the voters to de
cide whether four departments of the
city government shall be bettered. They
will be asked to give their approbation
authorizing the issuance of $35,000 in
bonds for school improvements, of $25,000
for a library building, of $20.C*>0 for put
ting the Webster-street roadway into
condition for the accommodation of
travel, and $20,000 for additions to the
electric light plant.
The decision to hold the bond election
was arrived at last night by the Board of
Trustees. They met In conference with
the Board of Education, Library Trus
tees and a Municipal League committee.
Plans were submitted by the depart
mental representatives. In each case the
Trustees agreed to give what was asked
of them.
The Board of Education members made
a strong plea to have the election held
as soon as possible. They urged that
school Improvements may be made dur
ing the summer vacation if the election
date be iixed the earliest. Their con
vincing arguments moved the Trustees to
appoint the date named.
The Library Trustees will have $33,000
to spend on a library buildingâ s2s,ooo to
be raised by bonds and $10,000 as a gift
from Andrew Carnegie. The Free Li
brary already owns a lot at the corner
of Santa Clara avenue and Oak street.
But it is not considered big enough. The
Trustees have been urged to purchase
fifty feet more frontage on Santa Clara
avenue for $4500. They have not con
cluded what they will do. They do not
know definitely the style of building they
will put up, but it will probably be a
two-story brick-and-stone affair. Plans
will be ready in two weeks.
The School Department will spend its
135,000 on additions to several school
structures in the city. An elaborate plan
has been devised. Additional rooms will
be built on to the Porter, Haight. En
cinal and Wilson schools. These schools
are so planned that wings can be put on
them when needed. The Porter will be
used as a High School in the future in
stead of the Haight. The design is to
secure the readjustment of pupils,
placing them in districts where they
properly belong. Concentration is aimed
at In the larger schools. The congestion
now existing in some of the schools will
be relieved.
Of the 120.000 to be raised for the Im
provement of the Webster-street road
way $10,<>">0 will be used at once for ne
cessary repairs. The $I>\OX) remaining in
the treasury will be expended later, when
title is acquired, in filling in the sloughs
and preparing for the final completion of
the street, widened to eighty feet.
The $20,000 for the electric light plant
will be available to make extensions and
additions and to purchase meters for new
consumers. The riroposed all night ser
vice cannot be had until these improve
ments are made.

Bachrini went to the Golden West
Hotel and retired. When the
chambermaid visited the- room
about 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Bhe found him dead, lying
fully dressed on the bed. From
the condition of the room Bach
rini had evidently committed sui
cide after long deliberation, as a
half-dozen partly smoked cigar
ettes were found In the cuspidor
and about the room. On the table
close to the bed was a bottle
marked strychnine and a glass
containing a few crystals of the
deadly poison.
The vest of the dead man was
unbuttoned and under the shirt
over his heart was the photograph
of the woman he had loved.
The following note in the hand
writing of the deceased was found
close to the body: "This ends It

of me. I cannot live without you.
Yours forever. MARTIN.
"Excuse writing In pencil."

LENT ELOQUENCE
TO ATTEST HIS
PUBLIC WORTH
Ex-Park Commission
er Metson Honored.
BANQUETED AL THE PALACE
LEADING CITIZENS GATHERED
TO DO HIM HOMAGE.
?
Brilliant Speeches Delivered by Elo
quent Orators â A Silver Set
for the Honored Quest.
Those Present
Had Mayor James D. Phelan attended
the complimentary banquet tendered last
night to William H. Metson on the latter's
retirement from the Golden Gate Park
Commission it would have dawned on him
that the greatest mistake he had made at
the outset of his administration under
the new charter was that he did not re
appoint the well-known attorney as Park
Commissioner. As he did not do so, Mr.
Metson's numerous friends took the op
portunity to express to him their high
esteem for him as a man arid a citizen
and also their appreciation for the splen
did services he rendered the city while a
member of the Park Commission-
Seldom If ever has a citizen retiring
from office been accorded such tokens of
approval as were tendered Mr. Metson.
Seated around the banquet board were
nearly 200 of the leading professional and
business men of this city, and they were
all present to express their. hJgh opinion
of Mr. Metson aa a lawyer, a citizen and
an official.
Beneath the folds of a large American
flag was the guest of honor. On either
Bide of him Eat the chairman, Colonel
F. E. Beck; ex-Governor James H. Budd.
M. H. de Young. Major General "William
R. Shafter, Frank Mattison (grand presi
dent of the Native Sons of the Golden
West). Chinese Consul General Ho Vow
and Colonel George H. Plppy. Through
out the evening Blum's orchestra and the
Knickerbocker Quartet rendered popular
selections, in which the banqueters Joined.
At the conclusion of the feast, when
cigars were lighted and all were mellow.
Chairman Beck arose and informed those
present that they were "here to-night to
welcome one of the kindest, noblest and
best men that God ever made In his own
Image." Continuing, he said: "We are not
here as Republicans, we are not here aa
Democrats. If we are here in any politi
cal sense at all we are here as socialists."
When the laughter which greeted this
sally had subsided Toastnmster Beck
stated that the task of making the ad
dress of welcome had been assigned to
Governor Budd, but before calling on the
latter he read communications from a
number of gentlemen who were unable to
be present by reason of illness or from
other causes. Among them were General
W H. L,. Barnes. Judge Frank Murasky,
James K. Barry, J. R. dttuiion, M. J. Mc-
Donald, Reuben H. Lloyd and Governor
Henry T. Gage. The letters of regret
sent by General Barnes and the Governor
aroused the greatest applause. In his
communica-tlon General Barnes said:
My Dear Colonel Beck: With such a let
ter as yours before me It is most difficult
to decline an honor bo cordlaJly tendered,
while to refrain from Joining so Kallant a
company feasting; bo good a fallow as Mr.
Metsoa is an aggravated misfortune. But
1 am Just up from nearly a month's inter
mittent Illness and am by no means fit to
be abroad o' nights; and. aa I should Ilka
to live to learn when the twentieth cen
tury bejrtns and when the Filipino war
ends, I must restrain my natural predilec
tion for good fellowship and good cheer and
go to bed early to-night.
I have not nad the pleasure of an Inti
mate friendship with Mr. ' Metson. bat our
acquaintance has certainly given me an
opportunity to understand why those who
know him best moat highly esteem him,
professionally and socially.
I was sorry to know he did not continue
on the Park Commission. Of all quasi
public Etations that or Park Commissioner
a/ways seemed to me the most aifrÂ«>^able.
lie has always before him bcautuul pur
poses and lmaeee. He disburses for the
people the only money whose spending is
tor the pleasure of old and young; he aoea
not Kovern. but he teaches, retine* and ex
pands human nature.
I think no citizen of San Francisco knows
Golden Gate Park better tha.u myself. I
saw its forests when they were sprouting
in pots and boxes. 1 have followed iv
splendid and continued Improvement with
an absorbing Interest. There Is not a sin
gle road or path over which I have not
gone a hundred times afoot. Like a good
book, it has been a delight in youth and
will be a consolation in old aÂ«Â«Â». And when
In my solitary Saturday and Sunday ram-
Ues in broadway and byway I have seen
Commissioner Metson on his charger, en
couraging by his presence the very flowers
to burgeon and blossom and the graa* to
grow, while at the same time repressing thÂ«
rattleweeded scorcher on the bicycle path,
I have envied him his power and his en
joyment of it.
When the spring time comes I shall walk
again in the well-known paths that wind
and waver under the trees and over the
hills; I shall inhale the salty ozone of the
I'aclnc, tempered by the breath of the flow
ers of art and nature; I shall be happy in
my life estate in a park fit for a dukedom
and daily becoming more and more suited
to the great city that shall be the light of
Asia but I shall miss Commissioner Met
son.'to whom I wish a long life and the
enjoyment oÂ£ the affection and recoct of
his many friends. Yours truly,
nis mauj w H BARNES.
As ex-Governor Budd arose to deliver
the address of welcome he was given aa
ovation. The guests arose to their feet
and cheered him until the banquet hall
reuounded with their voices. He eaid:
Our miest, 'William H. Metaon, hardly
needs a resDonae from me. His wbole life
Is a response, better than I can utter this
â¢vening. and that that life has not been
sr>ent In vain the stanch friends gathered
at this board best testify. To what has
been already said In this gathering I can
add nothing. Why I was chosen to respond
to the toast of our guest passes my under
standing unless it be that I was the mid
wife that brought him Into official belnjc,
aa his friends may think I have discovered
something good or bad about him. Mr.
Metson. as far aa I have bÂ«en able to dis
cover has never had any faults, unless It
be that of a fighter. To one of my passive
dlaDositlon this discovery was most shock-
Ing He has nlled two offices, one local
and' tbÂ« other State, and ho has well dis
charged the duties of both: in matter of
Industry *n mattef ot attention to duties.
In matter of fidelity. In all that an ofneer
can be faithful, Mr. Metson haa never been
surpassed. As a friend he has been stanch
and true and as an office holder he has been
one bright epot in my official career. As a
Yosemlte Commissioner he has been more
than a success. In fact he has been so
much of a success that two Governors did
not know how to gÂ«t alone without him,
and both have refused his resignation. As
a Park Commissioner he gave the same
close attention to his duties and did much
to beautify the people's pleasure grounds.
When the applause had died away Jus
tice C. H. Garoutte of the Supreme bench
arose and presented a beautiful silver
breakfast set to Mr. Metson. In part he
said:
We axe sorry that his official relations as
Park Commissioner have been severed. It la
our lose., not his; It Is the city's loss, not
his; and his successor, whoever he may be â
and he may be present to-nUhtâ l say his
successor will not be a better Commission
er i doubt whether his successor will be
aa tfood a Commissioner. I tako pleasure
In presenting: to you, Mr. Meteon. this
little token. To you, and on behalf of all
your frl*nrts. both present and absent, I
wish you all the pleasure, prosperity and
happiness which may be the lot or any man.
As Mr. Metson arose to respond to the
kind things said of him the entire gath
ering arose and greeted him with cheers
and with waving napkins. It was a
proud moment for Mr. Metson. He arose
and the tears of Joy dimmed his eyes, but
his bearing attested that the marks of
esteem shown him by his friends were
more valued than any commission Mayor
Phelan could have given him. At the out
set of his speech Mr. Metson's voice was
tremulous and his countenance showed
the feeling he wlghed to express to his
auditors. -!He said in part:
My friends, you have heard my brothers
address you In my behalf and It is hard for
roe to trlve utterance at this time to tha
words of gratitude that well up In my heart.
X do not think that I am deserving or any-

thing- more at your bands than to have m.
think that you consider ma to ba your
friend. Governor Budd put Ms trust la raÂ»
and save me two commissions. I do not
think I am entitled to any consideration be
cause I tried to do my duty aa 1 saw It and
tried to show to him whenever the occasion
required it that I was grateful. My other
friend. Judge Qaroutte. I have known for
many years. He is respected throughout this
State, and he haa always had my rtspect.
Both have token from me the thoughts, the
power to utter wbat I might say to you here
to-nUht. The fact that 1 was Park Commis
sioner of this city cuts no little figure. It
waa a very pleasant time to me. I know you
all take pride In the parK. because It 3
affairs have always been well administered
and the money raised by taxation has al
ways been well spent. It waa my ambition
to be one of the Fark Commission and that
ambition was attained, thanks to my
friends. And there I met as colleagues two
men who are the peer* of any men, Oiw of
them, Mr. Spreckels (loud applause.). I
was a stranger to them both. I
have no doubt that when I went
there there were many misgivings on
their part as to who I wav and how I w-ould
conduct myself. The other' man with Mr.
Spreckelsâ Mr. Zellle (applause)â opened his
heart to mÂ« -and they both were as good
and strong and honest in their care aad
work for Oolden Out- Park aa any men In
the community could have been. They
treated me like courteous, open-hearted gen
tlemen. They treated the city's affairs
from a business standpoint, cutting down
bills, and so long aa they shall slay there
you will find as good an administration as la
the past.
As to the gentlemen who have been added
to that commission, I do not know them all.
I know they will stand shoulder to shoulder
with the present men. and 1 bespeak for
Golden Gate Park your hearty support at
all times and on all occasions. This city
Is going to b*Â» governed under the new char
ter. There will be many more changes in
the future as there have been in the past.
It has been an experiment and we hope it
is a success, and It Is jour duty, you who
are citizens, to stand behind that adminis
tration and make it a success, because thÂ»
success of San Francisco means the suo
cesa of the entire State.
The speaker then paid a tribute to John
McLaren, the superintendent of Golden
Gate Park. He told of the splendid ser
vices the latter had rendered in his posi
tion and expressed the hope that he
would always be retained there, as he
knew every inch of the 1440 acres. In
concluding Mr. Metson said:
I am proud you claim me as your friend.
This Is the ereatest and the proudest mo
ment of my life. Never has a man in my
position, to my knowledge or to the knowl
edge of any man here, been given such a
tribute as you hava extended to me to
night That I appreciate It; that I will
treasure It. I promise you I will always be
grateful. I hope none of you will want
anything- at my hands, but It you do, I am
yours to command. Furthermore, gentle
men, *U that I want to be abia to do la
this world â as to the absent friend, as to tno
friends who have given me this dinner to
nightâU to be able to look you in tha eye
and take you by the hand and have >ou
feel that I never wan ungrateful to you and
that you never put your trust in vain.
~The orchestra struck up the popular
ballad "Because I Love You," and cheers
ga\e way to the sweet song, which car
ried to the honored guest the feelings of
affection In the breasts of iiis friends.
Then with uplifted glasses, they all sane
about him being a jolly good fellow, and
then the flow of speech continued.
Major General William R. Shafter re
sponded to the toast, "The Army im\
Navy," and he traced the history of both
and told of the nation's successes on '.and
and water. The hero of Santiago was
cheered vociferously. Ho Vow, his Impe
rial Majesty of China's representative in
this city, in excellent English expressed
the hope that the United States and his
country would retain their pleasant rela
tions and even come closer. lie spoke
highly of American products, manufac
tures and machinery, and hoped that their
introduction into hia country would bring
the two nations into closer relations.
Frank Mattison. Grand President of the
Native Sons 01 the Goluen West, sail
Borne pleasant things about his organiza
tion, and called for a rising toast to the
Native Daughters. Edgar D. Peixotto re
plied to the toast, "The Ladies," and paid
a graceful and beautiful tribute to the
fair sex, as well as to Mr. Metson. Ilia
sentiments were loudly applauded.
Alexander Vogelsang delivered a witty
speech, in which he said that he had re
cently returned from a visit to the Kast,
which convinced him that what he had
formerly believed regarding the munifi
cence with which nature had endowed
California was not half the truth. Here
after he would be v.Ul!ng to grovel before
the Â«nreatest liar the State produced, for
such mÂ«n only possessed the ability to
come within a mile of stating the facts.
Richard I. Whelan told several witty
stories which kept his hearers convulsed
with laughter and was recalled to give
others again and main.
M. H. de Young addressed his remarks.
SHREVE'S STORE ROBBED.
Burglars Were About to Crack Safes
When Scared Off.
Burglars entered the gunstore of George
W. Shreve, 739 Market street, some time
Monday night and got away with stock,
revolvers and cutlery to the value of $400.
Judging from appearances of two small
safes in the ofllce the thieves were about
to blow them open when they were inter
rupted sufficiently to frighten them away.
It la supposed that the burglars gained
entrance to the store by crawling through
a small hole in the hall overhead. This
is the third time within five years that
Shreve's place of business has btsen
robbed.

MAkTIN BACHRINI.
" ECAUSE he could not en-
Bdure to see the woman he
loved suffer, Martin Bach
rinl. a Swiss dairyman, end
ed his life yesterday morning In
the Golden West Hotel by swallow
ing the contents of an eight-ounce
bottle of strychnine.
Baehrini was a resident of Dut
tons Landing, Solano County, and
was interested in the dairy and
cattle business on property adja
cent to a ranch conducted by his
uncle. Joseph Sclarlni. On a recent
visit to this city Bachrini became
acquainted with Miss Phlna Theall,
or Olsen, as she Is sometimes
known, and at once fell in love
with her. Frequent visits to her
home only Increased his love until
he became madly infatuated, and
on his last visit to the city, about
three weeks ago, when he found
her lying sick In bed. he became
morose and melancholy, and to
ease his despondency commenced
to drink quite heavily.
Last Monday night Bachrini vis
ited Miss Thoall at her residence,
SCS Folsom street, and stayed until
a late hour. When he left her bed
side he kissed her and bade her
goodby. saying that it would be
his last farewell, as the thought of
her suffering was driving him
crazy. Miss Theall tried to com

WILLIAM KRUSE
DIES SUDDENLY
AT LIVERMORE
His Demise Will End
Litigation.
William Henry Knise. son of the. late
banker, Edward Kruse, died suddenly yes
terday at Livermore, where he had been
living in retirement for a few weeks on
account of ill health. He was a brother
of Edward P. and Emil T. Kruse. and
shortly before his death had engaged In
litigation with them over a trust clause in
the father's will.
Edward Kruse, the father, died in No
vember, 1696, leaving a large fortune to
William Henry's two brothers, a trust
clause in his will making it obligatory
upon them to look out for their brother
William as long as he lived.
On December 8 last he tiled suit asking
for a declaration of the trust clause and
made affidavit that he had been neglect
ed. In his complaint he asserted that
he and his brothers had taken a pledge
In the presence of their deceased father'B
remains that no matter how his will
might read they would divide the prop
erty equally among them. He claimed
that nut only had this compact been
broken but that the trust clause had been
disregarded as well.
On petition of Edward Kruse to be de
clared his brother's guardian on the
ground that he was insane from habitual
Intemperance and other mind-wrecking
habits. Judge Coffey expressed his will-
NEWHALL AND BICCY REFUSE
TO MAKE ESOLA CHIEF
Decline to Be Parties to Phe
lans Despicable Bargain,
Two Police Commissioners Stand Out
Stoutly for the People Through an
Exciting Executive Session.
C--J-3 HERE Is every indication that
Mayor Phe!an"s despicable con
spiracy to hand the Police Depart -
Jl rr.er.t cf the city over to those who
would make it an agency for the
promotion of crime and blackmail has
failed. The Police Commissiontrs by their
actions last evening showed plain'y that
they have too much respect for their goud
names and honor to become parties to any
fcLJch outrage.
Commissioners Bewhall and Biggy
refused flatfooted last night to vote
for Frederick Esola for Chitt of Po
lice, and announced that as long as
they had a vote it would never be for
him. Thomas and McNutt held out
for the Phelan-Lavrrence programme,
but failed to get it through.
Little apprehension is now fr.tertained
that Frederick Esola will be made Chief
of Police or that Andrew M. Lawrence
Â¦will be able to get his pound of flesh
from the bargaining Phel&n.
While no decision was reached on the
appointment of a head for the Police De
partment the fact that the Commission
ers, after a lengthy executive session held
in the Maycr'fc offlce and continued in
their cwr. apartments, did not name the
new Chief is taken as proof positive that
they refuted to abide by Phelans plans.
That Lawrence has practically thrown
t:p his hande was in a measure announced
by one of hi? attorneys, who i:i a condi
tion of unusual animation said more than
bt might otherwise have done.
Previous to getting down to business the
Commissioners discussed the Chief of
Police situation at an informal supper,
Â¦with Chairman Newhall as the ho.^t. but
the nature of the argument was not an-
A nuffiber of routine matters were dis
posed of before It was announced that an
executive session would follow. The
members at onco adjourned to the May
or's o!Tiee. where they remained for nearly
*n hour closeted with Phelan. It is au
thoritatively stated that others were
present who were directly interested in
the election of Esolii. It was intimated
that the meeting with the Mayor was
Phelan's last desperate act to whip the
Commit y'.or.ers into line and force them.
If possible, to forfeit their self-respect and
standing in the community in order that
be might be enabled to carry out one of
his pre-election bargains.
Subsequent developments disclosed al
most beyond the peradventure of a -loubt
that Phelan faiied ar.d that the Commis
cioners refused to be puppets to do his
bidding. When they left the Mayor's of
fice to resume their deliberations In their
own rooms the look of disgrust on their
faces as they marched through the cor
ridors toifi plainly the result of the Inter
view.
Andrew Clunie, who was one of the
Esola-Lawrence attorneys In the recent
investigation and who last evening was
filled with animation, accosted Commis
sioner Blgrgy in the corridor and accused
him of â¢'falling: down." Mr. Blggry re
sented the insult, but friends of the par
ties interfered before any blows were
struck.
Clunie followed the Commissioners into
the outer office, and when he was barred
from taking part in their executive de
liberations he lost control of himself and
began to talk. Mr. Lawrence's lieutenant 1 ?
were watching him through the open
doors, and they made frantic efforts to
get him away from the interested crowd
that was listening to his harangue.
He told how he had beon drawn into
the case and then thrown out of it. arid
took considerable satisfaction in the dis
comfiture of the Lawrence people. Cliri?
Newman was sent to bring the talkative
attorney out of the room. He whispered
a few words into his ear. but they had a
disastrous effect. He burst forth !n a
tirade against everybody.
"Those fellows in there," he said, refer
ring to the Commissioners, "are a pretty
lot of ducks. Fine kind of friends they
are. They pretended to be friends of my
client and now they have fallen down on
us. Biggy has fallen down. Thomas has
fallen down and I don't care a cent what
the rest of them have done." Clunie was
not given a chance to disclose any more
of the state secrets before he was ushered
out of the way.
After a loiig wait Commissioner Thomas
Cftme from the inner room and announced
to the ntwspaptr men that they need not
stay any longer, as nothing would "be
doir.r" that night.
After adjournment one of the Commis
sioners stated that the appointment of
Chief of Police was the principal matter
under consideration, but that the Com
missioners could not agree upon a man.
It is certain from this that they do not
favor Esola. It is intimated that three
Commissioners were against the appoint
ment of Lawrence's man, while but one
of them voted far him. The charges
against the lieutenant received but little
consideration.
The commission will meet again this
afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, when it is an
nounced the new Chief of Police will be
named.
