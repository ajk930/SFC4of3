Kloof would have cost 3000 men, and since
at least two brigades must keep the door
open behind us, too few would have re
mained to force the .way to Ladysmlth.
Moreover, General Buller remembers his
army Is the only army for the defense of
the rest of Natal. Therefore, he decided
to withdraw and try elsewhere.
"Another fierce attempt will be made
to force the Tugela. Great Britain must
realize the ugly | fa^t that the relief of
Ladysmlth would strain an army of
50,000r arid that 100,000 men would not be
too many. The country, therefore, must
be prepared for. a heavy loss, and per
haps for disappointment.
"Remembering that considerations of
honor, more than policy, demand cease
less efforts to relieve Ladysmlth,. the
whole army, despite disappointments and
retreat, regards General Buller with sym
pathy and trust 'such as are; seldom seen
even in fortunate ' circumstances.
"The security of Southern Natal is our
important consideration. â¢ The necessity of
obtaining control of Delagoa Bay is very
apparent. The ingress of foreigners and
war material is ceaseless. Surely a set
tlement with Portugal would be only a
question of money."

SABBATH TRAGEDY
AT PORT ARTHUR
Jury's Verdict of "Not Guilty" Set
Aside by a Mob of Aveng
ing Citizens.
PORT ARTHUR. Texas. Feb. tLâ
James Sweeney (white) was lynched
at 1 o'clock this morning. Sweeney
was a cotton screwman foreman, and
killed Charles Crumbach, a fellow
laborer, by running a bayonet through
his neck. The crime was committed on
the afternoon of February 1 in a room,
with no witnesses present, and Is said to
have resulted from a saloon fight that
took place a few hours previous. On Mon
day Sweeney was Indicted for murder In
the first degree. lie was placed on trial
at Beaumont. Texas, on Friday, and last
night the Jury returned a verdict of not
guilty.
As- soon as he was released Sweeney re
turned to Port Arthur, arriving here at
12:30 this morning. Word had been tele
graphed ahead that he was coming, ami
a mob met him at the depot, marched him
up town and strung him up to a telephone
pole without ceremony. In the first at
tempt the rope broke. The second attempt
was made successful by tyin? Sweeney's
legs, so his feet could not touch the
ground, and drawing the rope taut.
Its work accomplished, the mob. which
was made up of Port Arthur citizens, dis
persed quietly.
Sheriff Langham of Beaumont was no
tified and Immediately started for Port
Arthur. He returned to Beaumont to
night with "Jack" Martin, a boss steve
dore and a fellow-workman of Crum
bach's. In custody. Martin Is believed to
have been a ringleader In the lynching.
Port Arthur is the southern terminus of
the Kansas City. Pittsburg and Gulf Rail
road. The town was built up with the
advent of that railroad a few years ago,
and most of its citizens are northern peo
ple. The citizens deplore the lynching,
but none of them appear to condemn It.
WHEELER SPEAKS OF THE
ASSIMILATION OF CHINA
President of the University of Cali
fornia Gives His Views Upon
the Subject.
CHICAGO. Feb. 11.â "The greatest ques
tion of our time is whether the assimila
tion of the commercial force of China oy
the world will be a quick or a slow
process." declared Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
president of the University of California,
Â¦who passed through Chicago to-day on his
Â¦way East. "If the process be speedy." he
continued, "there in likely to be a disas
trous disturbance, but if it be natural and
unforced a peaceful adjustment will be
lr.sured. Therefore the question, not so
much of the Chinese as of China, is of
paramount importance to Americans.
"The pressure of ages has made of the
Chinese past masters In commerce. The'r
lack has been iron, and as the commercial
development of this country has bef-n
characteristically that of metals they
have eeerningiy been distanced. But let
them once acquire instruction from the

Â¦will be able with their genius to revolu

JOUBERT IS MOVING
TO ATTACK BULLER
DURBAN, Feb. 11.â It is rumored here that General Joubert Is marching
with a column of 6000 men to outflank General Buller.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â The World has the following from London: The
war expert of the Morning Leader writes In the issue of to-day:
"General Buller felt that It would be useless to persevere in the attempt to
relieve Ladyemlth, which would have cost more loss than the number of
men remaining In Ladysmlth. We heÂ»r now of two attempts to turn Gen
eral Buller himself, one by a small Boer column marching through Zululand
and another with 6000 men in Natal, under the redoubtable Joubert himself.
"It Is quite possible General Buller was held on the upper Tugela as much
by the ruggedness of the ground as by the enemy's artillery fire. He may be
bo weak on the lower Tugela as tt> leave his right flank and his communica
jtions with tho sea open to attack. But he must make the best of his force.

BOERS OUTFLANK THE
BRITISH AT RENSBERG
RENSBURG, Saturday. Feb. 10.â The Boers outflanked the British yes
terday. A considerable force of the enemy was threatening the British com
munications betweeen Rensberg and Sling-ersfontein. twelve miles away, and
during a reconnoissance by some Innisklllings and twenty Australians from
Sllngersfontein the Boers were discovered attempting to get a gun into posi
tion to shell the British camp.
The Australians, having come Into very close contact with the enemy, took
cover under a hill about 9000 yards from the camp. Thereupon the Boers took
up a position with a view of preventing their retreat. Some burghers got
within 200 yards of the Australians and called upon them to surender. They
replied by fixing bayonets and shouting defiance.
Sergeant Edwards and two men made a dash, and galloping under a hot
fire passed a number of hills held by Boers, took word that the Australians
were safe and confident of holding the enemy at bay and of getting out after
dark, which they eventually did.
The Innisklllings prevented the enemy getting their guns Into position. The
Australians lost one man killed and three wounded.
The convoys have been successful In getting to Sllngersfontein to-day,
the British escorts having had several brushes with parties of from twenty
to thirty Boers infesting the region. Lieutenant Colonel Page, with a section
of artillery and 150 horse, got one large convoy through by shelling the en
emy out of the road. The Boers also outflanked us on the west, placed a
gun In position at Bastards Neck and fired on one of our outposts, driving
off 1000 sheep. '-
To-day the Boers shelled the British camp, but with little affect.

Apparently the Boers have brought ell their big guns from Mafeking to shell Kimberley. Our
naval guns shelled Magersfontein to-day, but the Boer guns were silent. It is supposed that the enemy

Bosrs still man their trenches, but their numbers are apparently reduced. The bulk of their force has
gone to Kimberley or toward our flank.
The Highlanders returned last night. Before retiring they found the bodies of twelve Boers.
They believe the losses of the enemy were heavier than those of the British, because it is known that in
addition to the dead Boers found several had been buried

MANILA, Feb. 11â Of late the in

They shoot burnirg arrows and have thus I

Indeed, most of the towns In that j
province are practically deserted, except j
by the garrisons. Scarcely any of the In- !

LONDON, Feb. 12.â The fact that the
War Office up to the present moment'
has not Issued any message received
from Buller In regard to his retire
ment across the Tugela has aroused
a feeling of apprehension In some
I quarters that the Katal commander is too
i busily engaged In meeting a Boer flank
i movement to send any dispatches.
There are indications that the Boers
have assumed, temporarily at least, the
offensive and are moving upon the British
right flank and the line of communica-
has it. This place is probably a little to
the southwest of Inhlawe, since It com
mands both the road and the xti'lway
bridges at Colenso.
At the same time word comes' from
Natal of a further advance of the Zulu
land force of Boers, apparently develop
ing the flank movement in the direction
of Grey town. This would threaten the

Buller will have to leave White to hold

drawn all his forces to that place.
The London newspapers, having become
accustomed to checks, maintain a hopeful
tone, but the situation Is much more
threatening than It seemed tp be a week
ago. Proofs of the terrible strength and
mobility of the Boer artillery, together
with the rumor that General Joubert is
taking the initiative with the object of
cutting General Buller's communications,
are in no way reassuring.
Even the most sanguine persons begin
to see that Jt is quite hopeless to expect
the relief of Ladysmith, while It Is clear
that If it be impossible for Buller to reach
Ladysmith it is equally impossible for the
garrison, exhausted by sickness and prlva^
tlons, to cut a way out.
Reports of the Boer advance through
Zululand are disquieting. If they should
be able to strike at Greytown General
Buller would be compelled to turn, his at
tention to the eastern side of Natal.
The fact that Lord -Roberts arrived at

STUDENTS APPEAL
TO THE BISHOPS
Charges Made Against
Theologists.
BOSTON, Feb. 11.â The movement by
disaffected students ngain3t the doctrines
of Methodism as taught by the Boston
University School of Theology, which was
I formerly directed against Professor
I HlncUley W. Mitchell, has now taken the
J form of an organized attempt by the dis
{ sentlng students to weaken the standing
of the school and an attack has been made
upon W. R. Warren. Professor Henry
Sheldon and Dr. Borden P. Browne.
Professor Mitchell, after repeated re
quests for an answer to the charges
against him. has at last made a reply
covering the charges In a full and very
satisfactory manner to the authorities of
the institution. He explains his teachings
and gives his reasons and authorities for
his Ideas.
The attack by the dissenting students
has taken the form of a documentary ap
peal to the bishops and to the Methodist
church In general. This contains over a
hundred pages and starts with the ques
tion: "Shall Methodism remain Wesleyan
In type and evangelical?"
The direct appeal to the bishops main
tains the following propositions: That
such views as are held by the professors
should seek the Indorsement and encour
agement of the church whose doc
trines it covertly sc^ks to revolutionize, is
astounding. That the skepticism con
cerning a supernatural revelation should
seek the friendship of. a church .un
der the nurture of Its own vows and
altars Is beyond credence. But that
such . skepticism should fortify Itself in
two of the Methodist schools and seek to
become the chief tutor of theology and
thought and furnish the Methodist min
istry with Its doubts and negatives for a
life work on Â«vangellsm Is beyond reason
able comprehension.
The appeal claims that "tha twentieth
century movement" must languish and
the power of the church must fall If the
ministry of Methodism learns to deny the
authority of the word of God. to reject
the vlcariousness of the atonement and
accommodate the claims of Jesus Christ
to a' Unitarian conception.
They claim further that the teachings
of Professor Mitchell embody all of the
divergencies from scriptural truth and
that in them he is supported by his col
leagues, Professor Sheldon and Dr.
Browne. This means, they claim, the
carrying out of an alleged boast of Pro
fessor Mitchell to revolutionize the teach
ings of the Methodist church.
In his reply Professor Mitchell says: I
am accused of teaching that a belief in
the Deity of Christ Is not necessary for
salvation. This is correct, and in so
teaching T have the support of the found
er of Methodism, John Wesley, and I am
proud to be his follower. I am said to
have belittled the significance of the death
of Christ. I prefer to speak of salvation
through Christ rather than lay the whole
stress on his death, and In this I follow
Wesley
"I shall have to plead guilty to the

stories In the first chapters of Genesis are
more or less legendary. The statement

In the length of time given."
The document will be considered by the

CURRENCY BILL TO BE
DISCUSSED AT ONCE
Plan of the Work Laid Out for Action
Before the House and Senate
This Week.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11.â The first four
days of the week will he given up to the
rurroncy biil in the Senate, and after that
measure Is disposed of there will be a
contest for precedence In the interest of
Feveral measures. These Include the bills
for providing forms of government for
Hawaii anil for Porto Rico, the Nicaragua
canal bill and the resolution for the seat
ing of Senator Quay upon thÂ«* appoint
ment of the Governor of Pennsylvania.
Which of the^e will take precedence ny
mains to be determine. Just now there
is pome *harp sparring for first place. The
currency bill will be brought to a vote on
Thursday, and all the time not given to
pueh routine business as the Introduction
of bills and the presentation of reports
and petitions will be devoted to this
measure until it Is acted upon by the Sen
are.
The friends of Senator Quay say they
fully expert to be able to get considera
tion of the resolution In his behalf Imme
diately after the financial bill is disposed
of. but there is unquestionably a disposi
tion on the part of porpe of the Republi
can Senators to crowd the matter over
and take up either the Porto Rican or the
Hawaian bill, the chances between these
being favorable to the Porto Rican meas
ure. The Indications are that the Nica
ragua bill will be postponed until after
the Hay-Pauncffote treaty is acted upon
by the Committee on Foreign Relations
though Senator Morgan says he will ask
for the consideration of the bill at the
earliest opportunity.
The time of the House will be com
" rdetely occupied this week. To-morrow
tinder the rules, wil be devoted to Dis
trict of Columbia business. On Tuesday
the legislative, execMtive and Judicial ap
propriation bill, which will be reported to
the House to-morrow, will be taken up.
It is expected to consume Tuesday and
Wednesday, and on Thursday the House
will enter upon a week's discussion of
the Porto Rican tariff bill. This measure,
as the entering wedge In the matter oi
legislation for our insular possessions
naturally attracts much attention and
there has already devoleoped great 'pres
sure for time, especially upon the Demo
cratic .-ide, so that it is probable that
night sessions may be held toward the
close of the debate next week.

VICTORIOUS BOERS HAVE

ALASKANS OPPOSED
TO THE GROUT BILL
Demand the Bight to Elect Their
â¢ Own Delegate to Con
gress.*
SEATTLE, Feb. 11.â Advices from Skag
uay under date of February 5 state that
the following petition was adopted at a
mass meeting of citizens of Skaguay Feb
ruary 3 and is being widely circulated for
signatures: . .
We the undersigned citizens of Alaska and
of the United States, learn with regret that
Congressman Knox has agreed to postpone the
presentation of his bill to rive the District or
Alaska a delegate In Concress. to be elected
by the people of Alaska, and we therefore most
emphatically protest against the passage of the
Grout bill or any similar measure designed to
rob the taxpayers of this district of their right
to *lect their own delegate to Conrress. and
hereby solemnly declare that we would prefer
to leav* our affairs In the hands of. Congress
Itself rather than to have a . delegate chosen
by an appointee of the Government from among
the appointees of the Government/vg^^g
The meeting was called to take action
on the reported, position taken by Gov
ernor Brady before the Congressional
committee investigating the legislative
aid Alaska needs, and the Grout bill. In
addition to the adoption of resolutions
stating this sentiment there was - much
discussion of the action of the Governor,
many holding that he was not properly
attending to the needs of the people, he
represented. The resolutions also favor
moving the capital from Sltka. One of
the resolutions reads: . .'" . . . .
That Bald John G. Price is the only person
who has been clothed with even a shadow of
authority by the people of Alaska to speak for
or represent them In Washington.

OCEAU 1 TBAVEL.
NEW, YORK, Feb. 11.â Residents of the
Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn are deeply
interested In the kidnaping of Caroline
Lynn from the house where the child's
father lay dead. Caroline will be a month
old the day after to-morrow. Her motner
died soon after the child was born, and
her father, grieving over the loss of his
young wife, committed suicide a week ago
Saturday.
On Tuesday last Caroline was carried
off by friends of her mother's relatives',
who are Catholics, to prevent her, being
taken to Las Angeles by her father's step
mother, a Protestant. It Is alleged that a
priest aided the man, who falsely repre
sented himself as an officer of the court,
in securing the custody of the child, and
that this man and the baby's nurse fousht
fiercely for the possession of the child in
a room adjoining that in which the child's
father's body lay.
Frank Lynn, whose father Is a retired
brass founder of Los Angeles, came to
Brooklyn three years ago. He met Caro
line Boyle, an orphan, and married her
about sixteen months ago. They took
rooms tn West Fifty-eighth street, and
the bride's brother and sister, James R.
and Miss Leila M. Boyle, went to live
with them.
When Mrs. Lynn died Lynn Is said to
have ordered Mr) and Miss Boyle from his
house and to have telegraphed to his
father asking to be. allowed to return to
his paternal home with his child. The
elder Lynn replied that his wife, Frank's
stepmother, would come at once to New
York. There was some delay, and Lynn
in a fit of despondency wrote to his friend.
A. Leander Diack, to say that he was dy
ing and that his life was insured for $IsOO,
and asked Diack to collect the money, pay
his debts and care for his child until his
stepmother should arrive. Lynn then took
carbolic acid and died. His stepmother
reached the house two hours after he was
found dead. She prepared to carry out his
wishes.
Mrs. tTlary, who was employed as nursÂ»Â«
for Caroline, was alone in the house with
the child and the dead body of Lynn last
Tuesday, Mrs. Lynn having gone out. MrsÂ».
Clary says that Grenville Gardiner cf
Fifty-first street, where Miss Leila Boyle
now lives, entered the Lynn rooms and
said, "We have come for the child," and
pointed at a man in the garb of a priest
who stood in the hall.
This man said they wÂ»re acting by
orders from court, but as he could not
show papers Mrs. Clary says she ordered
him out. She says he then threw her to
the floor, took the child and ran out, fol
lowed by the priest, whom he addressed
as Father Curran. or some such name.
She adds that she followed them to Fifty
first street and Fourth avenue, where tliÂ«*y
entered a coach which wan waitiqg there
for them and were driven away.
Mrs. Lynn has gone back to LO9 An
geles, after being advised that she wouli
have no standing In court, as she is not
a blood relative of the child. She said
her husband would come to Brooklyn and
fight for the custody of the child.
Plight of the Besieged Town So Serious That
Roberts May Move to Its Relief Instead
of Invading the Free State. .
LONDOX, Feb. 12.â The latest dis
patches from the front, showing the
real reasrms for General Buller's
retirement^ v> d bis intention to try
again, quite destroy the comforting
and ingenious theory that the movement
was an elaborate feint to facilitate the
main . advance of Lord Roberts, a theory
which obtained acceptance largely because
of Balfour's misleading statement to Par
liament. These seemingly useless retl
cencles and prevarications on the part of
the Government and the War Office are
beginning to be criticized severely.
No word has yet issued from the War
Office regarding General Buller's latest
attempt, although the correspondents are
allowed to telegraph with a fair amount
of freedom, and thus far only a partial
list of ca^ualtie* has been published. The
dating of messages from Frere Camp may
Modder Rlyer and the apparent prepara
tions for an advance from that point
The mentjon in the dispatches, of Lord
Roberts to the War Office yesterday of
General Clements as commanding at Rehs
burer is interpreted to show that General
French with his cavalry has gone to join
Lord Roberts, and that considerable
changes in the, distribution of troops in
that district have occurred. Â¦ The unex
pected strength and activity of the
at Rensburg, where they are rather press
ing the British, than being pressed by
them, causes anxiety.
There Is no confirmation of the report of
a sortie from Ladysmith. The latest d's
patches from there, dated Wednesday
last, report that all was quiet then and
that instructions had been issued 10 bs
ware of the possible approach of Boer* In
the guise of a British relief force.

RULERS OF THE WORLD.
Meat-Eating Nations Are the Leaders
, in Every. Branch of Human
Achievement.
TnV rullnp rations of the world are meat
eaters and history records that they al-
ways have been.
Vcsretarlans and food cranks may ex-
plain this In any way they choose, but the
facts remain that the Americans, Eng-
lish, French, Russians and Germans ara
meat eating: nations, and they are also the
most energetic and most progressive.
The principal food of the heroic Boer
soldier known as Biltong, Is a sort of dried
beef, affording- a .frreat deal of nourish-
1 ment In a highly concentrated form.
The weak races of people are the lice
eatin? Chinese. Hindoos and Siamese, re-
garded since the dawn of history as non-
progressive, superstitious and inferior
physically and mentally to the meat eat-
ing nations who dominate them.
The structure of the teeth plainly Indi-
cates that human beings should subsist
upon a variety of food, meat, fruit and
grains, and It is unhygienic to confine
one's diet to any one of those classes to
the exclusion of another.
Meat is th<? most concentrated and most
easily digested of foods, but our manner
of living' Is often so unnatural that the ,
digestive organs refuse ;o properly digest
meat, eggs, and similar nutritious and
wholesome food, but It is hot because
such food is unwholesome, but the real
reason Is that the stomach lacks, from
disease or weakness, some necessary di-
gestive element; hence arising indigestion
and later on, chronic dyspepsia.
Nervous people should eat plenty of
meat, convalescents should make meat the
principal food, hard working people have |
to do so, and brain, workers and office
men should eat, not so much meat but at
least once a day and to insure its perfect
digestion one or two of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia -Tablets* should be taken after each
meal, because they supply the peptones,
diastase and fruit acids, lacking in every
case of stomach trouble.
Nervous dyspepsia, catarrh of stomach,
gastritis, sour stomach, gas and acidity
are only different names for indigestion,
the failure to digest wholesome food, and !
the use of Stuart's Tablets cures them !
all because by affording perfect digestion j
the stomach has a chance to rest and re- !
cover its natural tone and vigor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the real
household meÂ«'lcine; It Is as safe and
pleasant for the stomachache of the baby
as it Is for the Imperfect digestion of its
grand sire. â¢ -
They are not a cathartic, but a diges-
tive, and no pill habit can ever follow their
use; the only habit Stuart's Tablets in-
duces Is the habit of good digestion and
consequently good health.

In the three days' conference, beginning
to-morrow, under the auspices of the Na

Mayor Carter H. Harrison will deliver the
address of welcome.
Among the delegates who arrived to-day
Â¦were George Fred Williams of Massachu

Congressman Sulzer, in an interview to

"The remedy for the trust evil Is a sim
ple one; enforce the present laws. There
is no lack of laws to deal properly with
this question, but there is a sad lack of
officials with th<Â» courage and honesty to
rnforce them. Right there lies the whole
truth."
J R. Sovereign, formerly master work
man. Knights of Labor, said:
"The trust evil will find a corrective
in Itself to a large extent. Over-capitali
zation and restriction of production will
work the trusts' downfall. They so re-
Ftrict production and advance prices that
they will restrict consumption until they
are ruined."

HAVANA CIGAR-MAKERS
LOSE THEIR STRIKE
Agree to Resume Work on the Terms
That Existed Before
They Quit.
HAVANA. Feb. 11.â The strike of cigar
makers was settled to-day, the men agree
ing to return to work Tuesday on the con
ditions existing before the strike. The
cost of the strike to the manufacturers
has been practically nothing. The strikers
themselves have lost $100,000.
The Heraldo tells Samuel Gompers to

he came here with the intention of creat

men held to-day at the headquarters of
the worklngmen's union Mr. Gompers,
who addressed the meeting through an
interpreter, counseled the men to com

A prominent Havana lawyer, who num
bers among his clients many sugar plant

exists in the provinces and that many
estates will probably be forced to stop

manual labor in the tobacco fields, and
this industry cannot stand the expense.
He suggests that the means of communi
cation between the labor centers be cheap
ened and that Immigration be unrestrict
ed, although this would be too late for
the present crop.
ALMOST LOST HIS LIFE
BY A PRACTICAL JOKE
Fred Jacobs Induced to Stay All
Night on a Marsh Swinging
a Lantern.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 11.â Fred Jacobs, a
young man about 20 years of age, fell Into
the hands of several men while out hunt
ing last night and nearly met with his
death from the cold and fright they sub
jected him to. Jacobs met the party of
hunters, who were on the Lando ranch
hunting for geese late at night. The men
finding that Jacobs was of rather simple
disposition suggested that he go snipe
hunting with them.
Jaccbs agreed, and the men gave him a
sack and a lantern and told him to stay
on the marsh holding the sack and swing
ing the lantern and they would drive up
the geese. Jacobs did as he was com
manded and stayed on the marsh for sev
eral hours. When found by another hunter
named Edward Watson he was stiff with
the cold and unable to move. Watson
carried him to a near-by farm, when Ja
cobs was warmed and then sent home. An
attempt will be made to find the men who
played the old snipe hunting trick on
Jacobs.

at Suicide.
REDDING, Feb. 11.â Theodore Carroll Bhot himself through the head this
afternoon during the few minutes his sweetheart absented herself from the
room. Death is certain. Carroll was infatuated with Miss .settle Beeves.
the daughter cf the landlady of his boarding plape in West Redding. Carroll
called at the Beeves home during the afternoon and found that no one was
at home but Miss Nettie. A few minutes past 4 o'clock the young lady ex
cused herself from tne parlor for awhile. During -er absence 6he heard a
pistol shot, but thought it was fired by boys shooting In the woods, the
Beeves' home being on the outskirts of town.
On re-entering tho room she found Carroll stretched on the floor with a
hole through his head and a 3S-caliber revolver In his hand. The ball had en
tered the right temple and made its exit back of the left ear. The victim
never regained consciousness. Miss Beeves says they had not quarreled. She
says Carroll made no mention nor gave any Intimation whatever of intending
eelf -destruction. It is thought by some that the injury was the result of an
accident. Oa the other hand, it Is known that the young lady bad several ad

PHIPPS BREAKS
WITH CARNEGIE
New Development in
Frick Suit.
Â»
PITTSBUIIG, Feb. ILâ The Dispatch
to-morrow will Bay: "One of the sensa
tional developments of the expected suit
of H. C. Frick against the Carnegie Steel
Company (Limited) is the report that
Henry Phlpps Jr.. next to the largest
stockholder In the company, has broken
the business relations with Mr. Carnegie
which have beÂ«n exceptionally close dur
ing the latter's business life. The two
eteel kings have been associated ever
Elnce boyhood, and their Interests have
been identical, not only In a business
way. but in their philanthropic work and
social standing. The announcement of
thÂ« breach will therefore be a surprise.
Phlpps owned 11 per cent of Â£c capital
Etock of the company, which is more
than the holdings of any other one stock
holder except Carnegie.
â¢â¢It is eaid that Phipps alone stands as
the only partner whose signature is not
attached to the famous Ironclad agree
ment. The reasons for this are not known
to the public, but the important omission
it is eafd. will be seized upon by Frick as
one of the strongest arguments in his
efforts to have the celebrated document
broken, his contention, being that the
agreement cannot be binding when the
name of one of the largest stockholders
Is not attached. '
"David Watson, who drew up the pa
per, will be one of the leading lawyers
employed by Frtck to break It. and the
arguments put forth to this end by him
self and Attorney John G. Johnson of
Philadelphia promise to be very Interest
ing "
The Post to-morrow will cay: "The
earning capacity of the Carnegie Com
pany will not enter into the settlement
with H. C. Frick. if the contention of Mr.
Carnegie's attorneys is approved by the
courts. In outlining the defense one bt
the attorneys asserted to-day that the
"book valuation' referred to in the iron
clad agreement has nothing to do with
the profits. It simply represents the
value of the plant?, stock, bills receiv
able, money on hand, etc., at the date of
the last in^fentory, less the liabilities of
the concern. It does not allow a cent ex
tra for the etock as a. mon*-y maker; In
other words, the attorney held. Frick
could not discount the future."

HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT BILL
COMPLETED IN COMMITTEE
HUNDREDS OF SALOONS
SPRING UP IN MANILA
Chaplain Wells Denounces an' Evil That
Accompanied Occupation by the
Americans.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALIi, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1900.,
WASHINGTON, Feb. ILâ Repre-.
eentatlve W. S. Knox of Massa
chusetts, chairman of the House
Committee on Territories, has
completed his report on the
bill for the creation of the Territorial form
of government In Hawaii, and It will be
submitted to the Hou6e to-morrow. The
report is a very voluminous document, go
ing exhaustively into all the questions in
volved and thoroughly covering every
phase of the bill, which the committee
has agreed upon after many hearings and
much Investigation. Chairman Knox says
there is imperative need of early enact
ment of an organic act for Hawaii, as it
has become apparent that there is much
doubt of the extent of the power granted
to the local government of Hawaii by the
provisions of the Joint resolution of annex
ation, and In many important respects
there Is something like an Interregnum
In Hawaii.
Many doubtful questions of admiralty
and maritime Jurisdiction have arisen, as
well as of criminal procedure, rendering
it uncertain whether there is now any
tribunal for the decision ( of important
questions affecting property and any ex
isting method by which criminals may be
indicted or legal Juries impaneled for their
trial.
There is also grave doubt concerning
the power of the Hawaiian Government
to grant franchises for industrial and
commercial enterprises or for railways
which have been projected. In many re
spects the business affairs of the Terri
tory are brought to a standstill. MRiiy
Americans have bought Government land
since the annexation, on which they have
built residences and planted crops, out
their land titles are now in dispute and
cannot be settled until the passage of this
bill. Meanwhile no Americans can setde
In Hawaii on homesteads or land to be
bought from the Government, and a very
desirable class of citizens is thereby shut
out of this new Territory. The local gov
ernment is unable even to- make public
roads over any part of the public domain
of Hawaii or carry out plans based on leg
islation prior to annexation for widening
and straightening the streets of Honolulu.
The presence in that city of the bubonic
plague is calling for drastic measures by
the Hawaiian authorities, involving the
expenditure of hundreds of thousands of
dollars. In order to provide for these ex
penditures and to procure funds for the
construction of buildings which have been
burned in the effort to suppress the pes
tilence, it is proper and Just that a Terri
torial Legislature be provided by Congress
with no unnecessary delay.
Since the adoption of the resolution of
annexation large numbers of Japanese
contract laborers have been brought into
the islands. Their number is uncertain,
but at least 17.000, and probably more than
000, and delay In extending the laws of
the United States to the islands will be
taken advantage of to increase their num
b The government proposed by the bill for
the Hawaiian Islands is territorial In
form. similar to that of the later Territo
ries of the United States-a Governor, a
Secretary, both appointed by the Presi
dent; a Treasurer, Attorney General.
Commissioner of Public Lands. Commis
sioner of Agriculture and Forestry, bu
perintendent of Public Works Superin
tendent of Public Instruction. Auditor and
Deputy Auditor. Surveyor and High Sher
iff, appointed by the Governor. . ,
A Legislature is provided, consisting
of a Senate and House of Representatives,
elected by the people. The Territory is to
Ix- represented by a Delegate In Congress
The Territory is made a judicial district
of Mie United States, with a District
Court. The Judicial power of the Terri
tory Is vested In a Supreme Court and in
Superior Courts to be established by the
Legislature. The constitution and laws of
the United States locally applicable are
extended over the new Territory and the
laws of Hawaii not inconsistent with the
constitution and laws of the United States
are continued In force. The Territory Is
made a customs and revenue district and
becomes subject to the tariff laws of the
United States. Chairman Knox says It
needs no argument to convince that if It
be possible to give to the Hawaiian Isl
ands a government like that of the United
States Territoriesâ a government which
has met the approval of Congress and the
American people since the constitution
was adopted and has proved itself adapted
to the needs of a free and progressive peo
pleâit is desirable to do so.
The American idea of universal suffrage
presupposes that the body of citizens who
are to exercise it in a free and Indepen
dent manner have by Inheritance or edu
cation euch knowledge and appreciation of
the responsibilities of free suffrage and of
a full participation in the sovereignty of
the country as to be able to maintain a
republican government. Tried by this
test, he says, the Hawaiian people meet
the requirements for the government pro
posed.
The report discusses the population of
tho Islands with a view to establishing
this proposition. Of the 109.020 Inhabitants
in 1896 31,019 were Hawailans. 8485 part
Hawaiians, 3086 Americans, 2250 British,
1432 Germans, 101 French, 37S Norwegians.
15 190 Portuguese, 241407 Japanese, 21,616
Chinese and 1055 of other nationalities.
The report says there has doubtless been
some increase in the population since 189tJ
from American and European immigra
tion and a very considerable Increase from
the Importation of Japanese laborers since
the passage of the annexation resolution,
which may be taken at 20,000, so that the
population of the Hawaiian Islands at
present may be placed at more than 130,
000. Of this population the greater portion
are Asiaticsâ Chinese and Japanese. With
the passage of this bill the Chinese will
be excluded and the importation of Japa
nese contract laborers prohibited. Neither
the Chinese nor Japanese have political
power and were not eligible to citizenship
under the republic of Hawaii, nor could
they obtain homestead rights. The. Chi
nese have come to Hawaii intending to
return to their native land when pos
sessed of what to them Is a competence.
The Japanese largely have the same pur-
The Portuguese will furnish a part of
the citizenship of Hawaii. They are or
derly peaceable. Intelligent and indus
trious. The native Hawailans will fur
nish also a part of the citizenship. . They
are industrious, peaceable and generous
people. The free school, free church, free
press and manhood suffrage have marked
their progress. Tho government of , the
islands has shown the same progressive
development. All the younger Hawailans
speak, read and write the English lan
guage But perhaps the chief considera
tion as to the fitness of the Hawaiian
people for a territorial government is that
the dominant class, both in politics and
business, is American.
The government and policy of Hawaii
will be shaped In accordance with Ameri
can Ideals. Associated with the Americans
in Hawaii are the English and Ger
mans and It seems certain that the chief
Hawaiian Immigration in the future will
be from America and Western Europe.
The persons who were citizens of the re
public of Hawaii on August 12. 1593, are
defined in article 17 of-the constitution of
Hawaii:
Article 17â AH persons born or naturalized 'in
the Hawaiian Islands and subject to the Juris
diction of the republic are citizens thereof.
This includes all who were subjects un
der the monarchy and all who became
citizens of the republic.
The bill proposes to strike out the dis
qualifications made under the republic to
permanently disfranchise many of the
inhabitants, especially native supporters
of the monarchy. Biennial sessions of the
Legislature are provided. The number
of representatives is doubled to make it
a more popular body. The total author
ized indebtedness is limited to 7 per cent
of the assessed valuation of property of
the islands. The report says the amend
ment striking out all property qualifica
tions for electors of Senators was made
6n account of great opposition made to
this provision, both In the committee and
by other representatives. It appeared
that such a qualification had heretofore
existed in Hawaii, and this fact had been
salutary, and it Is hoped that this amend
ment will not unfavorably affect either
the character of so Important a body as j
the Senate of Hawaii, or ever be the
means of vicious legislation.
The provision thai, the povernor of the
Territory of Hawaii shatf be a citizen of
the Territory was Inserted, for the reason
that It was deemed inadvisable that the
Governor of a Territory so remote, and
where conditions were so different from
those prevailing in the main land, should
have a greater familiarity with the needs
of the Territory he was to govern than
more Indefinite residence would assure.
The bill provides for the continuing in
force of the existing land laws until Con
gress shall otherwise provide, but to meet
objections to the present land laws,' it is
provided that all land transactions shall
receive the approval of the Secretary of
the Interior, who may also reverse, modi
fy, suspend or annul any of said transac
tions.
The report says it Is wise and safe to
provide for the organization of the Terri
torial courts of the Territory of Hawaii
by substantially continuing them as now
existing under the republic of Hawaii.

Convicted Man Sleeps
Soundly as Ever.
NEW YORK, Feb. 11.â According to
Warden Hagen, Roland B. Molineux, con
victed of the murder of Mrs. Katherine J.
Adams, slept as calmly on Saturday
night as he did on any other
night since his Incarceration In the
Tom,bs, beginning nearly a year ago.
He arose at the usual time, exercised for
one hour, ate breakfast and read with ap
parent composure tho morning newspa
pers, after which he attended the usual
Sunday services.
The condemned man had but one visitor
to-day. The caller was his grief-stricken
and venerable father, who has not yet
given up hope and expects that the higher
courts, which will be appealed to, will
free his son.
All of the members of the Jury refused
to answer definite questions as to what
had occurred In the Jury-room, but one
of them, desirous of imparting some in
formation regarding the final proceedings
of the celebrated case, made a statement,
in which he said:
"If I were going to write as a reporter
about it. I would probably commence by
saying that the jury was a unit. upon the
guilt of the defendant: that one, two or
perhaps three of them, however, thought
it well to go through the case, discuss the
various phases of it and see if the evi
dence beyond a most remarkable doubt
would warrant such a verdict.
"I understand there was much conject
ure as to why the Jury did not go to
lunch after the charge, as expected, and
as a reporter I should attempt to ex
plain that by saying It was decided al
most Immediately after they reached the
room, while discussing whether to go to
lunch or not, that all were of one mind,
and each thought the whole matter could
be finished In probably, an hour, at the
most, and In order to get to their homes
quietly they decided to forego the lunch
and get along on the sandwiches."
"Would you write that there had been
much balloting?" he was asked.
"Well, I don't think I would have much
balloting in my versionâ probably a pre
liminary and final after the discussion."

MAYA INDIANS
LOSE HEAVILY
?
Mexican Troops Make
Progress.
AUSTIN. Tex., Feb. 11.â A dispatch
from Oaxaca, Mexico, says that General
Bravo Is making good progress In his
campaign against the Maya Indians In
Yucatan. Several engagements between
the Government troops and the Indians
have taken place during the last two
weeks, and the Maya losses are reported
to have been heavy.
The mosquito fleet of gunboats which
was sent up the Ballze and Hondo rivers
has been of little use, owing to the fact
that the Indians have kept some distance
from shore. Several small villages along
these rlvera have been destroyed by tho
gunboat crews and marines.
It is charged by Mexican army officials
engaged in this campaign that the Mayas
aro constantly receiving valuable aid from
the residents of British Honduras.

ing the Chief Justice and Justices of the
Supreme Court was made on account of
the change In the method of their appoint

to the President of the United Stages,
and it was deemed unwise to give this
power to remove from office Judges ap
pointed by the President, and further rea
son is that the power of removal is given
to the President by the bill.
Provision is made for the administration
of the revenue and tariff laws of the
United States, which are the laws govern
ing Hawaii, when the present bill shall be
come a law. The extension of the customs
laws and regulations of the United States
to the islands will be of great advantage
to the Uuited States, in that It increases
the production of goods imported from the
United States into Hawaii as against for
eign nations, and thus also increase* the
amount of duties which will be received
and which go to the United States.

Imported into the United States Is min

there are still about 1000 patients who.
together with three or four hundred as
sistants and helpers, form a unique and
remarkable community. It Is deemed Â»<y
those who are conversant with the facts
that It would be a great misfortune to
have the settlement disturbed.
An attempt has been made heretofore to
obtain the consent of the Hawaiian Gov
ernment to receive certain lepers from
the Pesthouse in San Francisco. There
also was a like attempt made by the au
thorities in Samoa. If the United States
should bear the expense or a portion of
the expense of maintaining these settle
ments It might lead to the sending of
lepers from other parts of the country to
Molokai. The annual expense of main
taining the leper settlement is $110,000.
The provision <"rant!nf American regis
try to vessels carrying Hawaiian register,
whether permanent or temporary, on Au
gust 12, ISJIB, together with certain par
ticularly enumerated vessels, was made
to meet the cases of certain vessels
bought In good faith and with the inten
tion of Hawaiian registry. They were
very few in number, and In addition to
those particularly mentioned there are
five others which receive the benefit of
this section.
The provision of a method in which the
Chinese now in Hawaii may obtain cer
tificates of residence is obviously to brine:
the Chinese in Hawaii under the laws o7
the United States. The purpose of this
section and the general purpose of the
bill, wherever possible to make said pur
pose effective, is that the annexation of
the Hawaiian Islands may benefit and not
injure American labor.
The annexation of the Hawaiian Islands
will In the future be of great advantage
to the United States commercially, as it
already has been. The exports of the
United States to the Hawaiian Islands for
eleven months ending with November
were $4,845,920; In IS9S. $5,891,735; In ISD9,
$10,206,157. The Imports for the same pe
riod from the Hawaiian Islands into the
United States were: 1597. $15,104,242; in
IS9B. $16,455,171. and in 1599. $21,672,062.
Â¦ The report says that whether It be true
as a general proposition that trade fol
lows the flag, certanly in relation to Ha
waii, it may be truthfully said that trade
followed the flag.
Â¦WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â Captain Frank M. "Wells, chaplain of the First
Regiment of Volunteers, who has Just returned from the Philippine Islands,
spoke In Garfleld Memorial Church to-day under the auspices of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union on the liquor question in the Philippine Islands.
He declared that since the Americans took Manila 400 places where liquor Is
sold had sprung up In Manila, while before the Americans came to the islands
Manila had only three saloons. The Filipinos, he asserted, spoke well of the
American soldiers, save that they said the Americans were "bad people"
when they had drunk too much liquor. Whisky, he said, was sold In the
barracks at Hollo not over fifteen feet from his headquarters until he put an
end to It by complaints to the colonel and provost marshal. The transport
Indiana, on which he had returned to the United States, he characterized as
a "whisky transport," and he said that he had unsuccessfully attempted to
have the sale of liquor on the transport stopped while in the Philippines.
LAST DAY OF
THE CONVENTION
Y. M. C. A. Delegates Oc
cupy Redlands Pulpits.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDLANDS, Feb. 11.â The nineteenth
annual State convention of the Young
Men's Christian Association came to a
close with a farewell service at the Bap
tist church after the regular church ser
vice at 9 o'clock to-night. The proceedings
throughout were marked by the high
character and breadth of view presented
by the speakers. A decided advantage
was derived from the presence ,of such
noted and successful workers as Field
Secretary C. K. Ober of Chicago and Sec
retary Sinclair of Dayton, Ohio, whose
papers and advice have been most inspir
ing. The Bible readings conducted by Mr.
Sherman have proved most valuable ex
ercises, calling forth a large attendance
each morning nr.d afternoon.
After the consecration exercises at 9
o'clock this morning many delegates vis
ited the Sunday schools of the various
churches. All the pulpits except the Cath
olic and Episcopalian were occupied both
morning and evening to-day by the lay
delegates, the subjects being in each in
stance the same, the theme relating to
the Young Men' 3 Christian Association.
In most instances the offerings taken were
for the benefit of the association. This
afternoon at 3 o'clock the men's rally at
the Young Men's Christian Association
auditorium called forth a splendid congre
gation of young men. The meeting for
women at the Presbyterian church at the
same hour and the boys' meeting this
afternoon were also well attended. The
character of the addresses, both during
the convention and at the churches to
day, and the broad lines upon which the
work was outlined, left a most favorable
Impression on the Redlands people.
Explorations Successful.

SANTA CRUZ. Feb. 11.-An attempt
was made early this morning to murder

Manuel Amaya. two young meo residing
in the neighborhood. While the game
was in. progress they made some excuse
and went out. leaving Louck sitting: in a
chair by the table.
They sopn returned, and Techera with
out the least provocation, struck Louck
on the head with a club, which he had
procured In the. yard. Louck, although
half stunned from tho blow, arose to de
fend himself and the men backed to tha
front entrance. As Louck advanced
Amaya drew a pistol and Techera ex

THE KENTUCKY SITUATION.
GOVERNOR TAYLOR of Kentucky has acted
wisely in deciding to leave the issue of the con
test over the Governorship to the Legislature
and the courts. That is in fact the only rational policy
for him to pursue. The law of the State provides a
certain course of action to be taken in the settlement
of disputed gubernatorial elections, and whether that
law be wise or unwise it is the duty of all parties
to abide by it.
If men are to take up arms and fight whenever they
believe their political opponents are about to take an
unfair advantage of them, the politics of this country
would hardly be much better than that of South
America. It is always much better to submit to a lit
tle wrong than to have civil wars, for smali wrongs
can be righted without a resort to such violent means.
In the Kentucky case the Governor has the more
reason to be content to leave his case and his rights
to the arbitrament of the tribunals constituted by the
law, for up to this time he has suffered no wrong from
them. The election boards of the various districts of
the State made returns showing a majority of votes in
his .favor and the State Election Commission, though
a majority of 4ts members are Democrats, approved
the returns and gave him a certificate of election.
It is the law of the State that gives the Legislature
the power and imposes upon it the duty of finally de
termining the issue, and if the legisators, through
partisan prejudice or any other evil motive, act un
justly and set aside the decision of the Election Com
mission, the responsibility of wrong-doing will rest
upon them and an appeal can be taken to the people
at the next election. Taylor has the proof of the jus
tice of his claim in the records of the election and
with these proofs in his possession can safely leave
the controversy between himself and the Goebelites
to the voters of the commonwealth.
It is a gratifying fact that throughout the whole
course of this outrageous proceeding on the part of
the followers of Goebel to take possession of the State
government by fraud or by force that the influential
Republican leaders and organs of the country have
steadfastly counseled moderation and respect for the
law on the part of Kentucky Republicans. There has
been no clamor for military interference to prevent
the Goebel Legislature from carrying out its resolve to
unseat the Governor. On the contrary, the prevailing
tone of Republican comment on the situation has been
that of a profound respect for legality. It is better to
submit even to a bad law than to violate a law, for
under our form of government it is in the power of a
people to repeal a law when it is found to be bad. '
It not infrequently happens in human history that
evil results in good. The bitterness of this contest,
leading as it has done to the assassination of Goebel
and the attempted assassination of Taylor, ought to
convince the Kentuckians of the criminality of their
political methods and the, barbarism of their fashion
of settling disputes. The Republicans of the State
i cannot serve Kentucky, better than by; setting an.
THE PRESENT LULL IN TRADE.
' 1 "RADE was singularly featureless last week, but
its volume was larger than for several weeks, as
* shown by the bank clearings, which fell off only
.8 per cent from the same week in 1899. For some
weeks these clearings have been considerably below
thobc of last year and the insignificant loss last week
shows that the volume of business is increasing again.
The very largest cities, too, which recently have ex
hibited the lion's share of the loss, are now gaining,
which is another good sign. The record of failures,
however, is still unfavorable, the disasters last week
being 245, against 217 last year.
As previously mentioned, the feverish excitement
of the past year or two seems to have completely sub
sided. Manufacturers are no longer complaining that
they cannot fill their orders. Machinery and woolen
goods lead in point of activity at the moment and
the new business in the latter is surprisingly large and
sustains the high prices, while the foreign demand for
the former is excellent. The iron trade shows some
slackening, accompanied by weaker quotations for
many descriptions, but there are enough old orders
on hand to keep the furnaces going for some time to
come. A decline in leather and hides has not in
duced the boot and shoe manufacturers to buy freely,
as they arc not getting the contracts that they need
at this season. Still, though the factories are buying
little, they are turning out more goods than ever be
fore, chiefly on old orders. In fact, were it not for
these old orders from 1899 the industries of the coun
try would probably be complaining of dull times.
Perhaps, when they are filled, new business may arise,
but that cannot be safely predicted now.
A good sign, and probably the best at the moment,
is the activity and strength in provisions. The con
dition of this line has for some years been the best
barometer of trade. When, after a period of stag
nation, business begins to pick up, provisions are the
first to show improvement, and when trade begins to
lag provisions are generally the first to quiet down.
Hence the current activity in these goods may safely
be taken as a favorable indication. There seems,
however, to be no particular speculation in anything
outside of Wall street. People buy what they want at
the moment and nothing else.
In Wall street the market had shown rather more
activitiy and the increasing ease in money serves to
stimulate speculation, though the public is not dip
ping very deeply and the professionals still have the
market largely to themselves. Toward the close of
the week there was a disposition to realize and ihz
feeling was heavier in consequence. Fluctuations dur
ing the week, however, were small.
In this city, local securities, after a period of dull
ness, showed signs of more activity, though the
volume of transactions was not up to the average of
1899. Merchandise continued active and no com
plaints were heard among the merchants. The con
tinued dry weather and frequent north winds have en
abled the farmers to catch up with their work and
vast areas are being seeded throughout the State.
Planters are complaining of the scarcity of nursery
stock and in the central part of the State many fruit
men, being unable to get fruit trees, are planting vines
instead. In the Upper San Joaquin it is said that
the output of grapes in three or four years will
be increased 50 per cent for this reason. The fruit
men have done so well during the -past year or two
that the croakers, who are forever crying down the
fruit industry as overdone, have gone into their holes
and there is a rush to establish new orchards and
vineyards, with the probable result that in several
years these enthusiastic planters, disgusted by a pos
sible bad j'ear or two, will be just as eager to dig
them up as they are now to plant them. At least,
this is the history of the fruit business in California.
It is the man who follows his business through thick
and thin, the cobbler who sticks to his last, that suc
ceeds in the long run.

The German Institute of Naval Archi
tects recently held its first meeting at
Charlottenburg, near Berlin. The society
Is not yet one year in existence, but num
bers already 605 members.
The oost of battleships In the British
navy was $245 per ton ten years ago, and
had Increased to 5375 last year. The addi
tional cost is due to more expensive mate
rial used and more complicated construc
tion, which items more than outweigh the
decreased cost of labor in the yards. .
The Russian coast defense ship General
Admiral Aproxin, which went ashore on
the coast of Gothland a few weeks ago.
Is still hard and fast. Some of the rock
upon which the ship rests has been blo-wn
up. but the effect of this heroic treatment
upon the ship is not stated.
Admiral J. S. Brand of the British navy,
speaking recently at Eastbourne, said that
"when an Inquiry was made as to the pre
paredness of the army for war we must
not forget to insist upon an equally strong
inquiry as to the condition of the navy. I
could say something that might alarm
them, but perhaps it would not be wise."
The keel of the battleship Albemarle was
laid at Chatham dockyard on January 1
last. The ship will be 405 feet long by 73
feet 6 Inches, and will displace 14,000 tons
on a mean draught of 26 feet 6 inches. Her
water-line protection will be a belt of Har
veyized steel 290 feet In length, of 7- Inch
maximum thickness, tapering to 3 Inches
at the ends, and the speed Is calculated at
19 knots. &@Â§l
The German navy at the present time
numbers 152 vessels for effective servlco,
which at the end of eight years will be in
creased to 222 if the Emperor's naval plans
are carried into effect- There are now 17
battleships, 8 coast defense vessels, 11 pro
tected cruisers, 27 unprotected cruisers, 5
gunboats and 84 torpedo boats. By 1908
there are to be added 23 battleships, 9 pro
tected cruisers. Â£1 smaller cruisers and
gunboats and 80 torpedo boats.
The trials of the Parson turbine-pro
pelled torpedo-boat destroyer Viper was
the second preliminary contractors* run,
and was four runs over the measured mile
course. ! The average speed was 34.8 knots,
and the fastest run for one mile 35.5 knots.
As the contractors have only guaranteed
31 knots during a three hours' continued
run, accidents only will prevent the boat
from doing considerably batter than con
tract speed.
The British sheathed cruiser Hyacinth
of 5600 tons has finished her speed "trial;
the latest under full power, giving the
following results. Steam in boilers, 251
pounds; revolutions of screws, starboard
169.15, port 173.55; total horsepower, 10.536;
speed, 19.4 knots: coal consumption, 1.58

horsepower/exceeded the contract by 538,
but the speed fell short one-tenth of a
knot. .

SYMPATHY AND , NEUTRALITY.
BECAUSE of the frequency with which many of
our leading statesmenluve declared their sym
pathy with the Boers, ami the fact that a large
majority of the American people agree with them,
fears have been expressed in some quarters that senti
ment may lead us to a violation of the laws of neutral
ity. Thus the New York Sun says:
"Because America's instinctive sympathy with the
Boer grows more irrepressible as he maintains
his struggle to defend his home in' South
Africa, it becomes the duty of those entrusted
with the management of the Government to hold
this country with the greater steadiness to the
line of impartiality. However high the Transvaal
sentiment rises in the United States, an American ad
ministration is bound to see that nothing be charge
able against us of favoritism to either of the com
batants."
The excellence of that sentiment is not to be dis
puted. There is a possibility, however, that in en
deavoring to avoid showing partiality to the Boers
we may err on the other side. Reports from the East
are to the effect that the British are making a very
large use of this country as a base of supplies for their
campaign and they are even enlisting men for military
service.
The Baltimore American, after directing attention
to a dispatch from Cape Town to the effect that 150
American .scouts who had arrived there as
"muleteers," were enlisted in the British forces, goes
on to say: "This is only one of a number of batches
which have been recruited for the British army by this
transparanet fiction and there are others getting ready
to sail, either as muleteers or hostlers, horses being
just now the principal need of the British which can be
supplied by the United States. This is all done by
commissioned officers of the British army. They
make known the number of men they wish to go with
a certain steamer and specify the qualifications re
quired, among these being service in the army in
Cuba or experience as scouts on the plains. The de
vice, of course, does not deceive any one and they
probably do not expect it to do so."
It ought to be comparatively easy for our Govern
ment to investigate the charges the American makes.
If it be true that British officers are recruiting men in
the United States it will be* a part of our duty of
neutralty to put a stop to it. In following the advice
of the Sun riot to permit our sympathy with the Boers
to lead us into any injustice to the British, we ought
also to be careful that our respect for British interests
does not incline us to overlook the rights of those
with whom we sympathize.

Alameda Argus.
It is hardly expected that the San
Francisco Examiner of one day will align
in policy with that of the next, but one
might without violence expect the differ
ent pages of a single issue to be reason
ably consistent. Yesterday, however, In
one place that distinguished Journal had
Thomas R. Bard elected Senator through
the machinations of C. P. Huntington and
In another it had him placed In the Mgh
and honorable position by the expenditure
of $100,000 of Spreckels gold. There has
been no sign for a good long time that the
Spreckeises and Huntington are in ca
hoots. In fact, a real discerning person
might conclude that they are a consider
able ways apart. Their interests, even so
far as a Senator is concerned, cannot be
wholly identical. How the people of Cali
fornia can, therefore, be expected to be
lieve that both Huntington and the
Spreckelses elected Bard is not likely to
be seen, unless a first rate diagram Is
supplied along with the proposition.
Sacramento Bee.
In an editorial upon the subject of
choosing United States Senators, the es
teemed Examiner is pleased to remark:
"There is but one reason why Mr. Bard
was chosen by the Republican caucus,
and that is that he is worth two or three
illlions of dollars."
Is not that about the only reason why
the late George Hearst, founder of the
present Examiner, was elected Senator by
a Democratic Legislature of the State of
California.
Los Angeles Times.
That journalistic drab, the San Francis
co Examiner, is now attempting to make
it appear that Senator Bard Is of the same
class of Senators as those who have
bought their way into the Senate. This
ridiculous nonsense is indicative of its
pure cussedness and the genuine Idiocy
that pervades the management of that
scurrilous and disgusting sheet. Never
was a man elected to the Senate from any
State more free from "strings" and otlÂ»
gations than Mr. Bard. He has no master
but the people, and hia character Is so Inr
above reproach that the Examiner cannot
appreciate the situation that exists in this
particular case. The Hearstllng organ
cannot conceive the possibility of a Sen
atorial election that is not based upon the
use of money, or some other form of briD
ery. Thank heaven, California has a Sen
ator to whom the mud from the batteries
of that concern cannot stick.
Fresno Republican.
The State has long since ceased to look
for decency from the San Francisco Ex
aminer, but it has yet to learn the full
measure of its indecency. Its recent gra
tuitous attacks on the political integrity
of the men who were responsible for the
election of Senator Bard was doubtless
by no means the worst the Examiner is
capable of, but they are probably the
worst it has yet ventured.
Stockton Independent.
The Examiner cartoons and fake sensa
tions connecting Senator Bard with the
Sugar Trust and with C. P. Huntington
are the height of silliness. The people of
the State are not so unintelligent and
credulous as to accept the Examiner's ra
sertion against the evidence of every
competent observer on the scene.
Alameda Argus.
Evidently the election of Thomas R.
Bard to the Senate is displeasing to our
especial friend, the Examiner. But we
very much fear the Examiner will not
make striking headway by charging Bard
up to either the railroad or the sugar
trust. Such tactics long ago passed Into
the domain of the chestnut.
GRILLING OF THE EXAMINER.
Severely Denounced by State Papers for Its Unwarranted
Slander in Connection With the Senatorial Election.
THE UTILITY OF PERSECUTION.
THE Roberts affair seems to have propagated an
anti-Mormon campaign. ' .
Obviously the proper thing to do is to pro
pose an anti-polygamy amendment to the Federal
constitution, adopt it by the required vote of the
States, and thereafter put the "twin relics" joined in
the first Republican platform both under the ban of
the. United States.
The spirit in which some are treating the subject
savers of religious persecution. The constitutional
authorities have not yet reported who are willing to
claim that Roberts was given his constitutional rights
by the House of Representatives. There were no
precedents for the decision in his case. Its only ex
cuse is that it established, and did not follow, a
precedent. -
No religious movement has ever been crushed by
persecution. Such movements are always founded
upon an idea, and ideas are immortal. The history of
the world should inform and deter those who think
there is utility in persecution. It did not suppress
Hussism, nor its imitators, ,the Huguenots. When it
was turned against the primitive church it did not
eradicate it from. England, where it is stronger
than in the days of Henry VIII. One or many
branches of Christendom never yet succeeded in de
stroying a single branch thereof by persecution. All
religious ideas flourish in New England, where the
Puritans sought their eradication by grievous pains
and penalties.
If Joseph Smith had never been murdered in
Carthage jail and his followers, hunted like vermin,
had never been driven toward the wilderness in a
hegira that ended in the prosperous settlements that
flourish in the Utah basin, it is highly probable that
Mormonism would long ago have been buried near
to its cradle. It has thrived on persecution, and a
renewal of that policy finds it now no longer a
Hagar dying of thirst in the desert, but a fully
equipped ecclesiastical organization, led by men of
great wisdom and great knowledge of human nature,
and with a record of material benefit to its followers
which it may well compare with that of any other or
ganization, secular or religious.
It will pay the opponents of Mormonism to take it
at its word. The rulers declare that the church has
abandoned polygamy, and that its life does not de
pend on plural marriage. The cases are at the worst
sporadic, and the institution would die by contact,
even if not barred by the law or banished by another
revelation.
Taking the church at its word, it can offer no ob
jection to such an amendment to the constitution,
and it is highly probable that a Utah Legislature
would join in its ratification. Then why not drop
invective and epithet, and ascription of bad motives
and bad faith, and compel the Mormon church to
expand naturally and not by the ever useful force of
persecution?
example of respect for law. In his determination to
recall the Legislature to session at Frankfort and co
leave in the hands of the legal tribunals the decision
upon his title to the office of Governor the Republican
leader has been true to American ideals, and if the
people of Kentucky be worthy of self-government they
will in the end justify his course by. driving from
power those who obtain it by bending the law to the
service of iniquity.
THE CANAL AND THE TREATY.
DESPITE the splutter of froth and fury which
has followed the announcement of the treaty
with Great Britain concerning the Nicaragua
canal, it seems likely the treaty will be duly ratified
and the enterprise carried forward. It would be in
deed a matter of regret if any controversy over the
treaty should lead to a postponement of the construc
tion of the canal. Both houses of Congress are now
ready to vote an appropriation for the project, but if
the present opportunity be lost there is no telling how
long a time may elapse before another so favorable
occurs.
There are two classes of persons engaged in de
nouncing the treaty â first, those who are opposed to
the canal and who are glad of a chance to prolong the
fight against it; second, those who are seeking for
material to be used in the campaign this summer and
fall against the administration. The first class see an
opportunity to baffle the canal project, for a time at
any rate, by inducing the people to believe that under
the treaty the waterway would be of more advantage
to Great Britain than to ourselves, and they have been
prompt to take advantage of it. The second class re
gard it as good Democratic politics at this juncture lo
represent the administration as surrendering American
right and the Monroe doctrine, and, for the sake of
making party capital, that class are willing to act with
those who are antagonistic to the canal under any
circumstances.
Fortunately the stanch advocates of the enterprise ara
not to be deceived by the clamor of the opposition, and
moreover there are a good many sterling Democrats
who are not willing to abandon the enterprise for the
sake of getting a fictitious campaign cry. One of
that class of Democrats is Senator Morgan, who is re
ported to have recently assured the President that the
treaty would be adopted. In an interview on the sub
ject the Senator is quoted as saying: "There is always
a lot of mouthing about anything Great Britain has a
hand in, but there is not sufficient reason for it this
time. I see that one of the main grounds against the
treaty is that in case of war ships of the enemy could
go through the canal and attack the Pacific Coast.
Where would our ships be all this time? Running
away or fighting? Why, they could pick their ground
for a fight anywhere, and for that matter could stay
in the canal itself and do their fighting."
While the outlook is thus bright at Washington it
is equally promising in Nicaragua. Reports from
that country quote President Zelaya as saying the one
great desire of the Government and the people of
Nicaragua is the construction of the waterway. No
objection will be made to the construction by our
Government instead of by private parties and the
President promises to grant every concession pos
sible within the constitutional limits of his power.
Of course, the outcry against the treaty will go on
and swell in loudness until the campaign is over. The
opponents of the canal are powerful and control many
newspapers and the Bryanites in their efforts to find
an issue against the administration will not hesitate to
join the anti-canal crowd in the fight. In the end,
however, reason will prevail. We need the canal. It
should be built at once and there is nothing in the
Hay treaty which justifies opposition to it.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
unauthorized person Is permitted to board
the vessel. TVhile the Director of Naval
Construction of the British Navy is re
sponsible for the design, and the blunder in
calculations which has made the yacht
unsafe is no doubt that of a subordinate
in the draughting room, yet. Inasmuch as
Sir "William "White would claim credit in
the event of the success of the vessel, hÂ«
must now also take the blame for the fail

A Parliamentary return gives some inter
esting and instructive figures on the mer
cantile tonnage and naval expenditures of
the principal maritime nations, as follows:
The mercantile tonnage Is that engaged
in foreign trade, and if Lord Beresford's
definition of the uses of a naval establish
ment is that of insuring the over-sea ship
ping, then Great Britain's naval expendi
tures are really the lowest when viewed as
a means of Insurance.
Flogging is still practiced In the British
navy, as the latest victim, Thomas Mc-
Geehan. can certify. He was a second
class fireman on her Majesty's ship
Doris, lying at Simons Town, and
was undergoing a sentence o impris
onment on the Penelope for striking
a chief stoker. McOeehan, tiring of his
confinement, shammed Illness, and a med
ical survey was held, disclosing the fact
that he . had been malingering. On this
a board of three officers sentenced the
man to eighteen lashes, of which eleven
were laid on according to the Queen's
regulations, when the prisoner became in
sensible, and the wretched man was car
ried bleeding and senseless to hte cell.
The British navy regulations prescribe
punishment for all sorts of offenses; boys
may be either birched or caned, and as
summary punishment men may bo flogged
not to exceed forty-eight lashes. The
offense of malingering, however. Is pun
ishable with Imprisonment not to exceed
forty-two days, and It would seem that
the officers exceeded their authority.
Flogging was abolished by law in the
United States navy In IS3O, and the la3t
record of violation of this law was in 1876
in San Francisco harbor, when the cap
tain of the Pensacola Inflicted this unlaw
ful but well-merited punishment upon a
lot of hoodlums on board hla ship. For
this violation of law the captain was
court-martialed and sentenced to two
years' suspension.
Prior to 1747 there was neither estab
lished rank nor a prescribed uniform in
the British navy, and the adoption of the
latter. is told to be due to an accident.
George II met the Duchess of Bedford
on horseback In a blue riding habit faced
with white, and the King was so well
pleased with the effect of It that, a ques
tion'having just been raised as to the
propriety of deciding upon some uniform
dress for the navy, he immediately com
manded the adoption of these colors. By
an order of council, dated February 10,

MISS WAKEMAN
JOINS FRAWLEY
FOR some Inscrutable reason Mr.
Frawley, after floundering around
â¢in melodrama and French farces,
brings his season to a close with
a good, genuine, entertaining comedy. If
he bad onlyâ but it's too late now, and
there's an end to It.
"An Unconventional Honeymoon" is
never slow enough to be dull and there is
plenty of crisp humor about ' It. It Is
neither dreary like the "Cuckoo" nor Im
pertinently comic like "In Paradise," but
moves along smoothly, with here and
there a little Jolt that shakes the laughter
out of one.
Such plays as this are the Frawleys'
field, which is proved. I think, by the work
they are doing in it. But more of the com
pany later. Miss Keith Wakeman, who
made her first appearance with the com
pany last night, commands priority.
b^e has ability and confidence as well,
and although she does not dim the luster
of Miss Van Buren In point of loveliness
she shows a more mature and conse
quently a surer art. There is a sugges
tion of masculinity about Miss Wakeman
and I can imagine her ripping things to
pieces in an emotional rolo. She has a
vocal register that drops to the most
sepulchral tones, and there is every evi
dence of physical force in her manner and
appearance.
It is Just as well, I think, that her part
afforded her no opportunities for flights
of passion, for she succeeded in being
quite charming in a tame state. I had
rather she would try to be simple and nat
ural and half succeed than she should
let loose all the energy that is in her and
fail through want of repression, and self
control. Frankly, her potential passion
awes me: I am very much afraid the lady
would rant.
It is gratlfyinar to find In this, the last
week of the engagement, that a member
of the company for whose presence on the
stage I have hitherto failed to find a rea
son actually comes to the front and acts
with downright cleverness. A Juvenile
role such as that of Tom Raycer is Just
what Francis Byrne needed to show what
Is In him. If he never attempted anything
else he might be rated among the best in
the business.
Armory, sls usual, is unctuous and en
tertaining. Harrington Reynold moves as
a peg and Mr. Frawley is not in the way.
His colloquialisms, which are supple
mented by similar efforts from Mr. Arm
ory and Mr. Byrne, are not out of place
in such a generally breezy affair as "An
Unconventional Honeymoon" and help to
move things along quite agreeably. The
play has plenty of that kind of humor
that knows no sect nor race, and whoever
sees It, provided he understand the Eng
lish language, will be healthfully and, I
may say, heartily amused.

TWO cars of division E. Market
street Railway Company's system,
one standing while an investigation
of the condition of a dilapidated
sand brake was being made, the
other rushing down the gTade toward
the turn that leads to the Cliff House,
both using their bumpers under the weight
of a half-hundred passengers, crashed to
gether yesterday afternoon shortly after
3 o'clock, and not a miracle, but the
close proximity of sand dunes, was all
that saved a score of people from serious
injury and possible death. Several people
were bruised and suffered sprains a*d
contusions, and Motorman J. T. Bates of
car 1117 of the Third and Kearny street
line, which had been pressed into the
beach service, suffered serious injuries.
Early in the afternoon the Market-street
Company became aware of the fact that
the beautiful weather was calling an Im
mense crowd of people from their homes.
This fact was not discovered, however,
until too late to remedy the oversight.
Cars to and from the beach were jammed
with people, men and boys crowded the
Bteps, and every bar and guard was cov
ered with clinging hands of pleasure seek
ers. Car 576 left the Stanyan-street ter
minus in this condition: in fact, not even
room remained for the proper handling of
the overloaded car by those In charge.
Car 1117. in charge of Motorman Bates
and Conductor R. H. Baker, immediately
followed, jammed as thoroughly as the
leading car. After reaching the top of
the grade opposite the Affiliated Colleges
the 6peed of the cars began to Increase,
until a epeed, as far as passengers
were able to Judge, of at least eighteen
miles an hour was reached. These light
cars were not constructed for ser%ice on
the overland limited, and It was through
this fact that the accident occurred. The
'-oiling and twisting of the forward car
had dislodged the sand pipe leading down
beneath the wheels, and this was just dis
covered when the motorman of the leading
car endeavored to slow down to round the
curve near the beach, after which he had
a straight line of road to the terminus.
The sand box was turned, but instead
of depositing the sand on the rails and
furnishing the proper friction to slacken
the speed of the car threw a cloud of
dust over the crowded pasengers. In an
instant the motorman knew that his sand
nine was out of order, and fearful that
the light weight of his car would cause it
to leave the rails at the turn and crush
and as soon as the name of a crying
woman was taken she was left for an
other whose name and address was
sought. However, when the railway em
ployes discovered that the passengers
were beginning to search for the cause of
the collision they got the passengers back
on the cars and took them to their des
tination.
The forward car went down the road
strewing bits of glass and splintered wood
along its way. The rear dummy was
badly twisted, stanchions were broken and
the fender dragged, but with its fifty pas
sengers It made the trip without leaving
the track. The front of car 1117 was a
wreck. Broken glass was strewn
throughout its length and breadth, stan
chions were smashed and seats demolish
ed. Still it was again loaded with pas
sengers, and through a controller that
stood at an angle of forty-five degrees
went the rest of the Journey. Car 676
made the trip back, but car 1117, being
short a motorman. was handled by the
conductor as controller.
Among the passengers on car 1117 who
will remember his experience for some
time was C. T. Smith, salesman with
Raphael, Weill & Co. "I was standing
Just behind the motorman when the
crash came." said Mr. Smith. "I knew
some seconds before the collision occurred
that it was Inevitable, but I was so closely
hemmed in by other pasengers that I
could not jump. The motorman fell at my
feet like a log when his car struck the
forward one and I was thrown with con
siderable force against the seat, sustain
ing Injuries to mv knee and wrist. A
friend who was with me, Thomas Higgins,
who is also connected with the "\\ hlte
House, I have not seen since the accl
oent. so thoroughly were we mixed in the
excitement."
Others tell similar stories, all aj^ree-
Ing that the motorman was immediately
rendered unconscious by *he foreÂ» of his
fall. About two hours after the accident
Motorman Bates recoveiea consciousness.
He said that he felt great pain in the
region of the groin and it is probable that
he suffered a rupture beside the electric
shock from the twisted controller. Bates
said he thouarht that his car was behind
576 a sufficient distance to Insure safety.
"When I saw car 676 stop I immediately
began my attempt to slacken speed. I
saw, however, that the momentum of
my car was too great to be controlled by
the brakes and so I reversed the current.
For some reason the power failed and the
car went on and crashed into 576. I re
member nothing further about the acci
dent except that It was my wish to stay
with the car and save the passengers If
possible. I am glad to hear that no one
was killed or injured."
out the lives of many under his care re
versed the curernt and the back grind of
the wheeis brought the car to a stand
still within a hundred feet. About a hun
dred yards behind car 1117 came rushing
on. It was apparent to some of the pas
sengers on the ttrst car that either no at
tempt was being made to etop the car or
that the bakes had refused to work.
Some of the passengers on both cars
jumped out into the sand and were Just
in time, for the caxs crashed together
with terrific force. A dozen people were
hurled headlong from the steps of the
cars into the sand, others standing within
were thrown to the floor and jammed
against the stanchions, while the crash of
glass, the ripping of timbers, the break
ing of iron bars, the shouting of men and
screams of women and children completed
a scene of terror. Just before the crash
came the slipping of the wheels told that
the current had been reversed.
The force of the collision hurled car
1117 back with such fÂ»rce that the wheels
set to the rails and the car started back
up the track. Not 300 yards away an
other car was speeding down the track
toward the scene of the collision. Motor
man Bates had been dashed against the
controller with sufficient force to render
him unconscious and an electrical shock
added to the seriousness of his injuries.
No one who understood the working of
the controller was near enough to turn oft
the current and the danger of another col
lision dawned on several men on the in
side at the same instant. Unmindful of
the screaming of children and the at
tempt to make fainting women comforta
ble they Jammed In the door In a mad ef
fort to reach the controller. Conductor
Baker, mindful of the danger, with
shouts and force managed to break
through the line of struggling men,
reached the controller and brought the
car to a standstill. The oncoming car was
slackened and the danger was over.
Within ten minutes seven cars were
standing on the down track and four on
the up. showing: the close proximity of
the cars and the danger that attaches to
such railroading. The Injured motorman
was taken from his car and carried to one
bound toward the city. He was still un
conscious when he reached the Stanyan
street police station. The excited people
on the car that carried him to the sta
tion followed, saw him placed on a
stretcher and taken to his home, 2520 Bush
street. *v;;:
After placing the injured motorman
aboard the inbound car the conductor of
No. 1117 and the motorman of car 576,
Charles Nelson, and the conductor began
the usual practice of obtaining names of
witnesses. But little thought was given
to the posstole Injuries of the passengers,
Evils of Discontent.
The meeting of the Social Democrats in
Turk Street Temple was addressed la3t
evening by A. Sorenson, who chose for
his subject "Discontent." Mr. Sorenson
spoke of discontent and its attendant
evils and in a talk of about half an hour
showed his audience the benefit and hap
piness to be derived from putting up with
their lot. whatever that lot might be,
until some lawful and proper remedy
should suggest Itself. He alao spoke of
discontent as It affects the masses who
suffer from the Injustice and rapacity of
a privileged few, and of the necessity of
constant, unremitting and united effort to
amend the present unjust social condi
tion.

The naval survey steamer Xero and the
horse transport Siam both made port yes
terday. The Nero is S3 days from Guam.
She has made soundings for a cable be
tween Guam and Hawaii, and her officers
say that a first-class route has been lo
cated. The survey boat did not atop at
Honolulu, so she had no trouble with the
quarantine officer. The Nero was for
merly the collier Peter Jebsen, and when
the Government purchased her during the
war she was made into a first-class ocean
going tug. She towed the coast defense
vessel Monadnock from here to Manila,
and after that was turned into a survey
steamer. Ever since she has been at work
on the shore line of the Philippines sur
veying a cable route betwen Manila,
Guam and Honolulu via Wake Island, in
all covering a distance of over 30,000 nau
tical miles. Her work Is now completed
and the chances are that la a few weeks
she wil be retired from active service ana
sold to the highest bidder.
The Slam also was a collier before De
ing chartered by the Government. She
left here with a load of 330 horÃes and
mules for Manila during the latter part of
August. She was caught in two typhoons,
during which her deckload was washed
away boats were smashed Into kindling
wood and the cargo of animals was so
badly injured that all but nineteen had to
be killed in order to put them out of
misery. On arriving at Manila Capaln
Raisich left the vessel and went home
Captain Valentine assumed command and
brought the vessel Into port. She left
Manila thirty-five days ago and had a
fairly good run across.
Of all the transports that have come
and gone from San Francisco the trip of
the Slam has been the most disastrous.
She was placed In quarantine on her ar
rival but will be released to-day.
The collier Washtenaw arrived in port

Matteawan. The Washtenaw left Comox.

The steamer Lakrae came along and the
second officer of the collier went ashore in
her to bring assistance. In the meantime
the Matteawan hove in sight and, seeing
the signals of distress onthe Washtenaw,
went to her assistance. The disabled ves
sel was towed into Port Angeles and the
Matteawan went on to Tacoma and load
ed coal for San Francisco. On her way
back she picked up the disabled Wash
tenaw and brought her here. The run

get some of his comrades ashore. Captain
Lamont scared him away with a blunder

MORAL MURDERER,
Matrons of the City Warned of the
Dangers That Beset Their Daugh
ters at Every Hand.
The Howard-street Methodist Episcopal
Church contained an audience that filled
nearly every seat in the edifice when Rev.
J. A. B. Wilson arose to speak last niynt.
The unusually large outpouring- was due
to the fact that Mr. Wilson had an
nounced he would speak to the mothers
of the city on matters made particularly
vital at this time by the case of Amy
Murphy. There were many matrons in
the audience and all listened with attou
tion to the remarks of the pastor and the
ethers who 6poke. The minister an
nounced before he began his discourse
that next Sunday evening he would epefc-k
of the remedy for existing evils.
Dr. Wilson referred to the fact that a
legal cpinJon had been rendered to the ef
fect that Poulin, the moral murderer of
Amy Murphy, could not be punished uncVr
the existing statutes for his relations with
the girl. As he had done at the funeral,
the speaker intimated that the plan pur
sued in the South, of the good people tak
ing the law into their own hands, should
b* followed here. He asked what the stal
wart miners of forty years ago In San
Francisco would have done with men like
Poulin.
Mrs. Charlotte Edholm spoke of the va
rious snares that lay in the paths of young
girl? in clt'.es, ar.d said parents should be
more careful of their daughters. Mra.
Edholm declared that Intoxicating liquors
were the cause of much Iniquity.
Mrs. Clara Foltz made a short speech,
in which she said that reformers should
pay more attention to the young men and
stop this continual "harping on the girls."
Man was as good as woman, she said, and
no better. Woman was as good as man,
and no better. Mothers should teach their
boys to have the highest regard for
woman's purity.
As tn statutes. Mrs Foltz said she did
not believe any could be passed that could

J. E. GORMAN.
A large number of crack rifle and pistol
shots gathered at the Shell Mound Park

were all favorable for phenomenal scores
the strong light was very trying to the

high averages. The best shooting was

Clever Pictures of the Championship Fight.
f-ii 3IIE adherents of Boxers Jeffries and Sharkey were
afforded their first opportunity yesterday of pass
j[ Ing judgment on the championship battle which took
place between the two herculean boxers at Coney
Island last November. The marvelous moving pictures
which were taken of the battle by the American Muto
scope and Biograph Company were displayed at the Al
hambra Theater yesterday afternoon and evening. The
theater was thronged to the doors on each occasion.
As usual after all boxing matches, the spectators were
divided in their opinions, although the majority thought
the worst Sharkey should have received was a draw. The
pictures show every incident of the fight, excepting that
of Jeffries losing his glove in the last round. The inci
dent happened just as the film was exhausted in the cam
era and before it could be replaced the fight was over
and Jeffries was receiving the congratulations of his
friends. The pictures are so realistic that the spectators,
viewing the mimic battle on canvas, often forget them
selves. They cheered Sharkey last night when he went
relentlessly after his burly opponent, and throughout the
exhibition they did not lose one single bit of the clever-
ness shown by either man.
There are many exciting moments In thÂ» twenty-five
rounds during which the men fought. For the major part
of the time Sharkey was the aggressor, while Jeffries
clinched and held on. The champion was slow to start
throughout, but did some effective work. In the second
round he knocked Sharkey down, but the sailor was up in
stantly as full of fight as ever. Jeffries drew first blood
from Sharkey's left ear in the eighth round and opened
a deep gash over his left eye .in the tenth. He opened
this wound repeatedly and blood could be seen on Shar
key's cheek and neck. Jeffries assumes the offensive
after the twentieth round, and although he staggers the
sailor several . times Sharkey walks to his corner with
jaunty steps. The pictures are a study alike for those
interested in boxing and for those who never saw a bout.
The former can Judge for themselves as to the merits of
the battle, while the latter can see every move incidental
to a fight. In addition to the two gladiators there are
other celebrities on view,
Tom O'Rourke, Tim McGrath and George Dixon appear
assisting Sharkey , while Billy Delaney, Tommy Ryan,
Ernest Koeber and Jack Jeffries handle Champion Jeffries.

PRIZES NOT PAID
AT SAN MATEO PARK
The deciding round of the stake at San
Mateo Coursing Park was not run, there
being no money in sight for the prize
winners. >liss Grizzle and St. Anthony
divided whatever honors attached to the
last two dogs remaining in the stake.
The troubles of the park officials com
menced early in the day, when it was an
nounced that Manager D. J. Tobln was ill
and would not be present. W. O. Elmer,
who was in charge of the pool boxes, re
fused to put his men to work, as there
were no facilities for handling the bet
ting. Attaches ol the park finally started
the coursing with one pool box in opera
tion. The coursing went along without a
ripple on the. surface until just before the
linal course. It was then learned that
one of the officials of the park had left
with all the money made during the day.
Andrew Dean, the judge, and Arthur Mas
gey, the slipper, learned of the turn affairs
had taken and refused to act. No one in
authority could be found who would as
sume any responsibility.
There was no demonstration, the em
ployes and the prize-winners who were
not provided for taking the matter philo
sophically. Some small boys turned what
hares were on hand into the field and
about twenty dogs were libertated in pur
suit of them. In the attendant confusion
a number of hares escaped. The coursing
throughout the day was of the most or
dinary quality, the hares being slow. The

from fruit, a pair of vertical arms being
attached to the sides of a tub to carry
an elongated straining net, which 13
twisted by a crank at one end to squeeze
the contents.
Not Half Bad.
"Lovely" Is an admirable word. It has
a meaning which Is all its own. There are
times when no other combination of
sounds will tell the story as well. But
there are women to whom everything that
pleases them Is "lovely." from a beau to
a spring hat or from a sermon to an oys
ter stew. To make matters worse, every
thing which pleases is "perfectly lovely."
Everything which does not is "perfectly
awful." It Is a relief, after listening to an
overseasoned exclamatory conversation of
this kind to listen to English people prais
ing somemlnc In the negative, semi-de
preciatory wayâ to be told that something
is "not half bad" Instead of "perfectly
splendid."â Chicago Tribune.
SIX FUNERALS.
Five Volunteers and One Begular
Buried at the Presidio.
The funeral of six of the dead from
Manila drew the Presidio crowds to the
cemetery yesterday. Five of the dead
were members of the old First California
Volunteers, and the sixth was -Thomas
Thompson of the Third United States Ar
tillery, who died In the islands and was
sent to his last rest on the hill with his
volunteer comrades.
The five volunteers were SergeantyC. B.
Lemon of Company B, Guy W. Packer
and Anton B. Mlson of Company C. Jo
seph* J. Towne of Company D, and John
J. Bowman of Company G. Members of
the companies named, some in uniform
and some without, made up the greater
portion of the train that followed the
bodies. They were all burled together In
the National Cemetery.
Lemmon a Councilman.
OAKLAND. F*Â»b. 11.â Mayor Snow to
r.lght announced the appointment of Pro
fessor John G. Lemmon as Councilman at
large, to succeed the late Charles H.
Kramrn.
The appointment will prove an unprece
dented surprise in political circles. If for
r.o other reason than that the appointee
has ever held himself absolutely aloof
from everything that savors of politics.
He has never held an offlce and has never
aspired to one.
The nÂ«"w Councilman at large has been
a resident of Oakland the past twenty
y<=ars. He is about 50 years old, a grad
uate of Ann Arbor. M!ch., a prominent
membr of Porter Pout, G. A. R., and
]>ader in the Telegraph-avenue Improve
ment Club. He is represented as a man
â¢ specially favoring improvements, but
conservative and ready to listen to the
combined wisdom of the various improve
ment clube and the City Council, and not
anxious to run the city Into debt, yet
ready to vote bonds for streets, schools,
jiarks ar.d wharves. He has no business
that takes him out of the city, and gives
the assurance that he will now devote
much time to municipal affairs.
English Anti-Cigarette League.
We learn from the Newcastle Chronicle
that one of the latest developments of the
young women's movement is the forma
tion of an anti-cigarette league among
the lady students of schools and college <*
to discourage the use of cigarettes amonj
the boys of their acquaintance. They
pledge themselves to detest the odor of
nicotine, not to give presents of articles
connected with the use of tobacco, and In
other ways "which girls know well how
to employ" to discountenance the us* of
a pernicious weed which is now so com
mon. The last clause of the pledge is
ominous, especially at the present time.
when the mistletoe season Is at hand. It
will be noticed that the constitution of
the new league Is delightfully vague, as
becomes "articles of association" drawn
up by ladles. Cigarettes are to be denied
to boys, but the prohibition does not seem
to apply to the damsels themselves. And
with the announcement of the formation
of this society comes a letter from a
schoolmistress deploring that In her own
and other similar genteel establishment*!
she finds that the practice among the far
pupils of smoking daintily perfumed
cigarettes "on the sly" Is becoming alarm
ingly common.â London Illustrated News.

land until the funeral. The great place

SECOND SERIES OF
RELIGIOUS LECTURES
OAKLAND, Feb. 11.â The success of the
"Congress of Religions," under the au
spices of the Young People's Religious
Union, at the First Unitarian Church, has
been so pronounced, both in interest and
attendance, that a second series has been
announced. The claims of Judaism, Ca
tholicism, Protestant orthodoxy and a lib
eral religion have occupied the past four
Sundays. The second series will include
the following: February IS. "The Claims
of Spiritualism on the Modern World," by
Mrs. R. S. Lillle of New York; February
25. "The Claims of Vedantlsm." by Swaml
Vive Kananda of India; March 4, "The
Claims of Theosophy." by W. L. Ducey of
Michigan; March 11. "The Claims of
Christian Science," by D. F. J. Fluno.
SWORD THICK
That Astonished an American Visi-
tor to a Store in Madrid.
"Of all the cities I have visited m
Europe '* said R. A. Btlnson. of Boston.
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "I found Ma
drid one of the most interesting. It has
a number of out of the way features that
appeal to one. For Instance, take the
Rastro, which Is a street In one of the
lower sections of the city wholly given
over to the purchase and sale of second
hand articles. I U3Â«d to spend a good
deal of time there. There are twoâ l
think threeâ equestrian statues In Madrid
that depict a horse that has since become
obsolete. It ia the horse of the Middle
Ages, that carried not only the rider clad
in armor but armor on the horse as well.
With the' giving up of the use of armor,
thla particular horse's mission in life
came to an end, and he disappeared from
off the surface of the earth, and the only
memory of him left is In an occasional
equestrian statue or picture of that date.
I was in Madrid I tried to pur
chase one of the famous Toledo blades.
The old-faÂ»hlone<S two-hand aword waa
what I wanted to get. one of those that
were built to cut through armor and
which fulfilled their mission completely,
as many a bloody battlefield In ye an
cient days bore testimony. I had to give
It up on aeount of the expense. They cost
from $1 60 up, but while I was looking ft)r
one a shopkeeper showed me a most
scientific trick- His store was very lofty,
running up two or three stories, and was
descanting on the beauties of this partic
ular sword, when. In order to prove the
perfect temper of the metal, he drove the
point into the floor and bent the blade
until hilt and 'point met. He then sud
denly released the hilt and the six feet
of gleaming sword sprang up Into the air
like a thing alive. Up and up It went, al
most to tne lofty ceiling Itself, when It
lost Its Impetus and began Its descent
hilt first. It returned almost to the place
whence It started, the shopkeeper catch
ing It by the hilt with practiced ease and
returning It to its case. I waa crazy to
try It myself, but the owner refused to
allow me, as he thought I would probably
not only wreck the store but perhaps in
jure myself as well. He told me that if
I wanted to learn the trick I had better
practice it In a large open lot, and that
a suit of armor wouldn t be a bad thing
to wear nntll I got the hang ot It."â New
York Tribune.
THREE POLICEMEN
GET TWO CROOKS
OAKLAND. Feb. 11.â Louis Jackson and
Charles Clark, two hoboes with a pen
chant for petty larceny, went beyond
their limit to-day and are now locked up
In the City Prison on a charge of burg
lary.
They entered the room of William Law
son at the corner of Third and Franklin
streets this evening and stole a satchel
containing a suit of clothes and a check
for $60. Several other inmates of the
place saw the thieves departing with
their plunder and notified the police. Po
licemen Moore. Hamerton and Kyte were
detailed on the case. They found the
burglars hiding in a lumber yard at Sec
ond and Clay streets. They had the
stolen property In their possession.
Jackson Is 42 years of age and Clark is
61. They have both been arrested many
times before on petty charges.

vent this morning. , . .. i, â¢-'.-
Oakland Office of the San Francisco Call, 1118 Broadway, Feb. 11.
AN eloping couple, closely pursued by the bride's irate mother, were mar
ried in the lecture room of the First Christian Church this morning. The
elopers were Frederick Hart, son of James Hart, one of the wealthiest
ranchers of Colusa County, and Miss Dolly Holloway, an elocutionist of
considerable note and superintendent of the Christian Sunday-school of Wood
land. Yolo County.
The big church organ had Just begun pealing forth its voluntary for the
morning service, the congregation had become fairly seated and Rev. Guy
W. Smith, the pastor, was about to make his usual opening announcement,
when he was suddenly summoned to the lecture room, where the nervous
groom and the blushing bride were promptly united.
As Rev. Mr. Smith pronounced the concluding words of the nuptial cere
mony a rustle of skirts, a cry of dismay and a sudden opening of a door
announced the arrival of the bride's irate mother, Mrs. A. Holloway, who had
hurried all the way from her Woodland home in the hope of thwarting the
marriage, as she had done last Wednesday. But alas! she was too late and
the knot that God had tied could not now be untied, her remonstrances avail
ing nothing. For the bride, her daugnter, Mrs. Holloway expressed a
mother's sorrow for a girl that had left a happy home. For the groom she
had little more than a marble heart and a cold glance of vindictiveness that
foreshadowed a total eclipse of all hope of a mother-in-law's blessing or re
conciliation. Then the organ's voluntary ceased and the pastor had to hurry
to his pulpit, while the happy bride and groom left the scene, followed by
the angry mother-in-law.
Young Mr. Hart had held many secret meetings with the pretty brunette
Sunday-school mistress of W r oodland. Many times he hurried over from his
home in Princeton to press his suit and the Sunday-school mistress' soft
hands. And Mrs. Holloway was kept in almost total Ignorance until early In
the week she unearthed a plan whereby her daughter and the wealthy
young rancher were to be married at Sacramento last Wednesday. Her ef
forts to thwart the union were crowned with success on that occasion, but
the lovers became only the more determined. Yesterday Mr. Hart came
down and secured the marriage license In this Gretna Green and this morn
ing the Woodland Sunday-school mistress was missing. Her absence now has
been accounted for. The young couple will make their home on the big
ranch, which the groom has been managing for his father.
The bride is a decided brunette, with large black eyes. She possesses re
markable talent as an elocutionist and is popularly known from Sacramento
to Red Bluff on account of the many entertainments she has given In aid of
charity. Her brother, Dr. E. S. Holloway, is a leading dentist of Yolo

Capital.
Senator Bard spent yesterday resting
after the fatigue of the contest at Sacra
mento and the reception Saturday night
at the Union League Club. To-day he will
leave the city for Mare Island, where he
will make himself familiar with the situa
tion at the naval station. He will take

that place. He will arrive at Ventura in
the evening, where another public dem

assert that they came here to forget their
troubles in the pleasures that San Fran

INJUSTICE OF
ENGLAND'S WAR
ON THE BOERS
Stinging Sermon by
Rev. Guy Smith.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 11.
"The Course of England From a Scrip
tural Standpoint" was the subject of Rev.
Guy W. Smith's sermon at the First
Christian Church this evening. He said
in part:
"We find ourselves at a great disadvan
tage in considering the course of England
with reference to the war in South Africa,
having to depend for our information
upon very unreliable sources. I have no
desire to call in question the motives of
that great nation in waging war with an
almost unknown and uuneard of republic
in the south of the dark continent, but to
deal with facts that are beyond all ques
tion of a doubt.
"Whatever may have been the principles
involved that lea to a declaration of war,
it Is an offense against civilization and
acalnst God that it ia continued. We are
all familiar with the arguments that it is
oppression; that life is being sacrificed to
no purpose; homes are shrouded In gloom
and mourning; hearts are broken and lips
are quivering with sorrow that will never
again know the smile of Joy â and yet
England stands to-day guilty of a far
worse crime than oppression. By the un
necefsary shedding of blood in the rav
p.ges of "war she is doing that for which
God's word arraigns a man aa worse than
an Infidel.
"While England Is spending vast mil
lions to carry on this war against the
Boers millions of her subjects are starv
ing to death for the necessaries of life.
Oh! what man among us who has life
enough to contend with his fellow man
would not hide his head in shame if his
neighbors were compelled to support his
children; and yet England goes on to war,
with a deaf ear to the err for bread and
permits appeals to be made to her neigh
bors to support her starving subjects.
"We are compelled to lift our voices In
protest and cry shame upon such a
course. I believe It Is the duty of every
Christian to help suffering humanity, but
while America is ministering to the needs
of English subjects upon English soil we
should demand that she stay at home and
take care of her family or else get out."
FRIEND'S FIRST
SERMON WAS A
GREAT SUCCESS
Preached to a Large
Congregation.
â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Feb. 11.
Prrbably tne largest and certainly the
most cosmopolitan audience that has
gathered in an Oakland sacred edifice In
y-^ars appeared In the First Presbyterian
Church *o-nlght to hear William Nat
Frier. 1 prea:.i his first sermon. Not only
were all the seats filled, but the aisles
also were crowded.
The congregation included professional
mcr. religious men, â 'onhanlcs, clerks,
saloon-keepers and In fact men from
every walk in life. It was estimated
that there were almost 2000 people pres
ent. At the conclusion of the services Mr.
Friend was tendered a spontaneous ova
tion, which was participated in by almost
everybody in tae church.
"I aon't need to introduce you to the
gentleman who Is going to fill the pulpit
of this church to-night," said Rev. Dr.
Coyle, the pastor. "Mr. Friend is prob
ably' better known to the people of Oak
land that I am. He has been in the law
and newspaper business, but wherever he
has been ne has maintained his cleanness
of mind and action and he has a host of
friends equal to his exceedingly wide
acquaintance. He is a young man who Is
genial, broad-minded and of great In
tegrity, a young man to whom it gives me
great pleasure to pay this tribute. This
is the first time Mr. Friend has ever
preached, but I feel confident that even
those who expect the most from him will
not be disappointed." Â¦*..Â¦â¢â¢.>-
The delivery of the young ecclesiastical
student was perfect. He preached with
out the aid of notes or manuscript and
throughout the discourse he held the rapt
attention of his large audience. For a
text Mr. Friend took the quotation, "Why
follow Christ?"' From It he deducted a
logical and eloquent sermon. '--; -~ ;-".
"The young man of fashion seeks pleas
ure instead of religion," ho said. "The
man who accumulates riches is a seeker
after gold and makes It his one aim. So
engrossed is he in gathering it he does
not know the undertaker will one day
come around." Mr. Friend then gave his
idea of the politicians in whose ranks he
was once numbered.
"And now down the avenue comes the
politician. He is a grand fellow to grasp
your hand, and you loosen the bond of
sympathy within you at once and prom
ise him your vote before he has even ask
ed for it. But he is done with you then.
All you catch is a smile as he scurries
across the street after another, and an
other man like yourself. All day and
through the night he keeps up his tire
some grind of welcome. Year in and year
out he Is at it. His family have him only
toward the early morning hours. He gets
an office or he controls the patronage of
a Governor. The best years of his life go
to the effort and then there comes an
evil day. Another takes his place and he
struggles against the slow tortures of po
litical death and is laid away in the po
litical cemeteryâ put away on the shelf of
desireâ a worn and back number, good for
nothing to himself, his family and his
friends. His goal, his hppe, his ideal has
been reached all too soon, and he cries
out aloud in his misery those famous
words which Shakespeare put In the
mouth of Cardinal Wolsey. the politician
Prince of Henry v ill, 'Had I but served
my God with half the zeal I served my
king he would not in my age have left me
naked to mine enemies.' We should look
for everlasting life as well* as earthly
things. Life eternal does not begin over
the great beyond. It commenced here and
in the cradle." -Â¦ , ;> -' -:^ -
Mr. Friend Implored his hearers to
think of their future and concluded by
asking them not to judge his remarks
from an oratorical standpoint, but to con
sider the meaning which he attempted to
convey. , , ,
His Initial appearance In the pulpit was
so successful he will shortly address an
audience in San Francisco.
SEES MILLIONS
OF ANGELS WITH
HIS NAKED EYE
The New Religion of
"Prophet" Smith.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 11.â The police ambu
lance was sent down to Alameda Point
last night to fetch an old man, known as)
"Prophet" Smith, who was reported to be
dying In a hovel there, to the Receiving
Hospital. The police met with a vigorous
protest from Smith against being re
moved to any hospital. He said he hod
no intention of dying Just at presnt and
could get along all right If left alone.
"Prophet" Smith lives In an old hulk.
which carries the burdensome nam* of
Central Pacific. The boat leaks so t>adly
that the owner has to sail It principally
on dry land to keep it from foundering.
A mast with ruasa like a ladder sticks
up at one end of the craft. Smith climbs
to the top of this mast every morning to
pray, as he is particularly religious. His
idea is to get as near heaven as possible.
When the boat is risked In deep water,
which is seldom. It will sail In only one di
rection, and that the direction of the tide.
"The Religion of the Messiah" Is. the
name of a new sect founded by the- old
man. It consists of three decrees, the
titles of which he cannot divulge. The
word of God. he says, is directly commu
nicated to him, and he Is endowed with
unlimited powers. Things are revealed to
him Just as they were to the old prophets.
If people would follow his teachings they,
would live forever.
"Heaven is revealed to me." said Smith
to-day, "and I can see millions of angels
flying around space with my naked eye.
They are everywhere. God talks with me
every day or two. When he wants me he
asks in a deep voice, 'Is that you. Smith?
I am your God. I want to talk to you.'
and then he tella me how to direct the
people. That's why I've got this boat.
It's to hold religious meetings on. All can
not get this religion I preach, as it is only
for a select few. The location of rich gold
mines in Alaska Is known only to me. and
knowledge of untold wealth all over the
world has been revealed to me.
"I was on the earth 7000 years ago, and
when I ascend to heaven I will stay there
7000 years before I came back to Ala
meda."
SALVATION BY
PROXY IS BUT
A DELUSION
Claims of Liberal Re
ligion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Calt.
- v; 1118 Broadway, Feb. 11.
The First Unitarian Church was again
crowded to the doors to-night when Rev.
Benjamin Fay Mills delivered the laat lec
ture of the first series at the "Conirreas
of Religions." His theme was "The
Claims of Liberal Religion on the Modern
World." He said In part:
Liberal religion Is not dogmatism. It Is not
indifference. It Is not negation. It is not ln
definlttness. It may be denned as such a con
fidence in the divine soul and the manifesta
tion of that soul in men at this stage of human
progress as to lead a man to cast himself on
his dlvinest Impulses, In full assurance that
this will bring him necessary knowledge, con
tinual progress and right relationship with his
fellows.
There Is a sense in which this religion makes
no claims on the modern world. It 1* simply a
question as to whether the modern world has
grown sufficiently to appreciate It.
So.r.e ono well says that men worship God
socially and transact their business Individ
ually, while the fact is that they should
transact their business socially and let their
religion be a concern for the Individual. No
man can be "saved" by any religion Imposed
from without, but only by the development of
knowledge and character In himself. Salvation
by proxy Is a delusion.
It believes that "Time makes ancient rood
uncouth." and that "They must upward still
and onward who would ke*p abreast of truth."
A man may attend a liberal church, he may
have had Unitarian ancestors, he may believe
what he considers liberal doctrine, but all these
will not make him worthy of the name unless
he trows In all that constitutes a man.
The liberal man can recognize the spiritual
In nature and worship it with the pantheist:
he may believe in the Immanence of God and
rejoice In It with the Buddhist: he may recog
nize the continuity of divine revelation with
the Catholic, and he may emphasize the right
of private Judgment with the Protestant, and
yet believe that his religion transcends all
these. While he believes that all the truth
ever In the world la here now he knows there
ir yet more to be discovered, and fearlessly
consecrates himself to search for It and find
It wherever he may.
I can see good In every form Of religion for
the people who are Interested in it. As Lin
coln said: "If you like that sort of thing,
that Is the sort of thin* you like." They have
all grown out of us and may rrow out of us
still. If you were born a Jew and see In
the doctrines and forma of Judaism the high
est of which you are now capable, then be a
good Jew. If you hunger for authority In re
ligion and that seems to you the highest ex
pression of which you can conceive, then you
wculd naturally be a Catholic I never said,
as reported, that I had any Idea of becoming
a Catholic, but I Drefer to emphasize the good
characteristics of others rather than to search
for their defects.
If you believe in thÂ» traditional rlewa of the
Bible and regard it as a once-for-all. ultimate
revelation of God, and are satisfied that your
duty calls you to surrender your will to ltÂ«
precepts, then you may well be an orthodox
Protestant, and I hop* you will be a good
one. But if you are a free soul, or wish to
be if you bÂ«lieve that a man may discern in
his own soul sufficient Msht to lead to his
spiritual development If he will but follow
it: if you beli*vÂ» in the evolution of the soul
and that humanity possesses the power to pro
duce better and better religious expressions and
activities with the passim; sies: tf you be
lieve In the progress of the race, in the human
ity of God and the divinity of man. If you
thick that love Is a sufficient remedy for all
woes In all worlds in all a*es. If you will
endeavor to live the lovln* life. If you want
to "Look up and not down, look forward and
not back, look out and not In." and to "L*nd
a hand.' then we say "Coma on!" and hold
out welcoming hands to the (freat fraternity
of those who believe above all things In truth,
freedom, prosress and love.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1900.
FIXING OF THE
WATER RATES
NOW TO BEGIN
Roberts' Wells as a
Side Issue.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 1L
The big annual fifeht over water rates
begins to-morrow night. At that time
the Council In committee of the whole
meets to attack this question, but what
will be done no one knows. Councilman
Cuvellier desired that the matter be taken
out of the hands of the Fire and Water
CommitK-e, of which he is chairman, and
placed in the caxe of the committee of th*
whole.
ThiÂ» year there will be two points to be
fought- One. the water rates proper, and
the other, the tests of the Roberts wells.
Which issue will cloud the other remain*
to be S6*n.
As there will be no report from the
Water Committee to begin upon it will be
necessary to work from the present ordi
nance, which was adopted a year ago by
this Council. An effort will be made by
some of the Councilmen to force a meter
rate, and President Watkinson of the City
Council says that it would co6t $175,000 to
jUt meters in the city, and he will object
to that. This meter move seems to be.
tibout the only new proposition that will
l-e presented on this occasion.
Those in the Council who hoped to make
c substantial move toward municipal own
*-rt-hip will turn their attention to the
teeta of the Roberts wells, and there will
be much paid upon the points already
given in The Callâ that George L. Dlll
msn was a Contra Costa Water Company's
?TRineer, and the claims made by the
Seventh Ward Municipal Ownership
League.

Preparing Him for the Worst.
"I had a cheerful experience the other

"'Not much.'
"Â¦'Well, lots of people come here for the

tempt to hold up south bound train No.
405 on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway was made last night Just
after the train left the coal chute a mile
north of Perry at 9:45. Some one pulled
the bell cord and the train was slowing
down when the engineer noticed several
masked men standing near the track. The
engineer opened the throttle and the train
dashed by the would-be robbers, who
made a futile attempt to board it. Offi

Very Mysterious Murder.
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 11.â J. Schutz, a
wealthy wine dealer, was shot and mor

Who the would-be murderer is or why
the attempt on Mr. Schutz's life was
made are regarded as mysterious. The
bullet was fired through the window.
Streetcars in Germany.
The chances of evading fares on the
streetcars of German cjtles are very
slight. When a passenger steps on a car
the conductor immediately asks where he
is going, and then prepares his ticket,
which serves also as a receipt for the
fare. The preparation of the ticket con
sists only In detaching it from a book and
punching It or marking it with a pencil.
This process involves much more work
than the simple process of ringing, up
the fares, as conductors do In America;
but the task is lightened by the fact that
only a certain number of persons are per
mitted to ride on a car at the same time.
The number of sitting and standing places
Is plainly marked on each car. If a car
is designed to carry thirty persons no
more than thirty persons will be per
mitted to ride on the car at the same
time. When anything in Germany Is for
bidden it is sottled once for all. In order
that every person who rides shall get the
prescribed ticket Inspectors are employed
who spend their time in â¢ ascertaining
whether the conductors are doing their
duty. These inspectors step into the cars
and ask the passengers for their tickets.
They note the number of the tickets and
whether they correspond with the stubs
retained by the conductor. The clerk who
gives out the Nocks of tickets to the con
ductors notes the number of the upper
most ticket and at the return of each
olock collects from the conductor who re
turned It as many fares as there are
â¢ tickets detached. The rate of fares va
ries from 2V cents to 6, according to the
distance. Small children are carried for
half fare, and any one for the sum of
$2 BO may secure a ticket which entitles
him to ride as much as he wishes for one
month. When a car Is full the conductor
displays a placard bearing the word "Oc
cupied.'-'âChicago Record.

Suicide of a Pioneer.
OAKLAND. Feb. 11.â Because he was
old, decrepit, without friends, and penni
less. William Gibbons, a pioneer of Ala
meda County, took a dose of strychnine
to-night and killed himself. The despond
ent self-murderer was 75 years of age.
He committed suicide In a little shack in
which he lived at Mission San Jose.
Gibbons came here from Ireland in the
early day? and amassed a fortune. His
money was lost In unwise speculation and
for a number of years he has lived pre-.
carlously, being unable to do much work
because of his enfeebled condition. Lately
he has occasionally labored on a ranch
near San Jose, but he was not able to
earn a great deal of money.
The deceased had attempted suicide on
several occasions. He was never married
and po far as i<Â» known had no relatives
In this country. Coroner Mehrmann will
hold an inquest.
FACTS ABOUT SARDINES.
The Greater Part of This Country's
Consumption Now Packed Here.
Formerly the sardines consumed in this
country were all imported from France;
now about three-quarters of the sardines
eaten in the United States are- put up
here, the chief center of the sardine in
dustry In the United States being the
eastern coast of Maine, though some sar
dines are now put up on the coast of
California. The packing of sardines In
this country was begun about thirty-five
years ago. Thousands of people now find
employment In one part and another of
the work In catching flsh. in making:
cans, and in canning and packing and
marketing and so on.
Sardines are put up In greater variety
than formerly, there being nowadays
sardines packed in tomato sauce, sar
dines In mustard, spiced sardines and bo
on; but the great bulk of sardines, both
imported and domestic, are still put op
in oil. Sardines are put up also in a
greater variety of packages than for
merly: there being, for example, various
sizes and shapes of oval tins, and some
French sardines are Imported In glass;
but as the great bulk of all sardines are
still, put up in oil, so the great bulk of
them are still put up in the familiar flat
boxes, the great majority of these being
of the size known as halves and quarters,
and far the greater number of these being
In quarters. Sardines are packed 100 tins
in a case, and the consumption of sar
dines in this country Is roughly esti
mated at from a million and a half to two
million cases annually.
Like canned goods of every description,
sardines aro cheaper now than they for
merly were, and American sardines are
sold for less than the Imported. American
sardines are now exported from this coun
try to the West Indies and to South
America.
VENISON HIS RUIN.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie Moralizes on
Isaac's Fatal Weakness.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie preached an interest
ing sermon last evening In the First Pres
byterian Church. Sacramento street and
Van Ness avenue, on the theme "They
Married, and Then ." His text was
taken from Genesis, xxv:2s: "Isaac lovei
Esau because he did eat of his venlÃon,
but Rebecca loved Jacob."
Prior to his discourse the preacher read
the twenty-eighth chapter of Genesis, In
which is recounted the theft of Isaac's
blessing by Jacob at the instigation of his
mother. In Introducing his theme Dr.
Mackenzie said that Lot's great fault was
avarice; Ham's, sensuality; Noah's, drunk
enness, and Isaac's, venison. Because
Isaac loved to eat. and especially to cut
venison, he loved Esau better than Jacob,
because the elder boy was a hunter and
supplied his father's palate. .
"So wonder that Rebeeea, who had
vowed to take Isaac for better or worse,
rebelled at such a snoring incarnation ot
venison." he said. "That caused the trou
ble In that household and made of Rebec
ca a schemer. These things were not
written for people living In the time of
Moses, but for you in the great VXtO; vtu
are the beneficiaries of the historic talc."
From the tale of the sacred scribe Dr.
Mackenzie drew the moral that frequently
a husband made marriage a failure by
his attention to something or regard for
something that inspired contempt on the
part of the wife. It was the duty of a
wife under such circumstances, he said;
to endeavor to wean her husband away
from his idols. Rebecca, he said, fell short
on the score of patience. He believed all
wives naturally reverenced their husbands
and that generally the husbands were to
blame if such was not the case.

Celebration Committee Sets Business
Aside to Discuss Affairs of the
Struggling Men of the
Had England's Premier, Lord Salis
bury, been connected by telephone with
Red Branch Hall, 1133 Mission street, yes
terday afternoon he would have been for
cibly impressed with the fact that the
sons of down-trodden Ireland sympathize
very much with the Boers who are strug
gling to retain their freedom over in
Africa. When the words of Judge M.
Cooney, Richard O'Connor, "Bob" Ferral,
"Bill" Broderick and others went sizzling
into his ears he would probably have
sprung up with a jump, thinking a live
trolley wire had crossed his own line.
The convention of delegates from Irish
societies to arrange for the celebration of
St. Patrick's day was in session when the
Boer matter came up. Sub-committees
were to report on a programme, the
choice of an orator and so on, but
the meeting never got beyond the discus
sion of the Transvaal war. There was a
large assemblage of delegates.
C. B. Flanigan, chairman of the meet
ing, as soon as it had been called to or
der, announced that it had been decided
to donate the profits of the entertainment
to the Boer relief fund.
"There may be some objection made to
such a donation, and as it is specitied for
what purpose the money is to be used,"
sj.id Captain Filgate. "it had better be
stated mat it is for the widows and or
phans." â¢
"Just donate It for hospital and relief
work," said Judge Cooney. "That will
relieve the committee of the danger of
any breach of international law. After the
money gets over there we'll not ask what
use it has been put to." A burst of ap
plause swept the hall at this last remartc.
Mr. Flanigan then introduced the fol
lowing resolutions which had been pre
pared by his committee:
Whereas, Great Britain is waging a war ot
conquest on the Transvaal and Orange Free
Stale and the tacts show it to be conclusively
inspired by unjust, selfish and mercenary mo
tives; and whereas, the heroic defense of the
Boersâ a defense glorious in victories, where
the few lighting: lor homes and Independence
have hurled back great armies ot the invader â
Invites the admiration oÂ£ mankind; and
whereas, the British Government, under the
humiliation of constant reverses and defeat 3 ot
its armies, and with hatred and envy of the
valiant foe, has put in motion machinery for
another great army of invasion, by conscrip
tion if necessary, it Is meet that our Govern
ment, allied to the South African States by
unity of principles and with a vast majority
of its people in sympathy with the South Afri
can republic, should intervene to stop the fur
ther shedding of blood, such Intervention be
ing in accordance with our history as a Chris
tian people, and it should maintain the sov
ereignty of the Boer republic.
Resolved, That the Government of the United
States be requested to tender Its friendly of
fices, with, a view to stopping further blood-
Resolved, That this convention of the Irish
societies of San Francisco, assembled to pre
pare for the celebration of St. Patrick's day,
send greeting to President Kruger of the Trans
vaal and President Steyn of the Orange Free
State and congratulate -them on the glorious
victories of the armies of their republics; that
we salute their commanders, Joubert, Cronje,
Meyer and our fellow Irishman, Blake; that
we hope for continued success in their defense
and we pray God that ultimate victory may
rest with their arms and the result be the free
dom and independence of South Africa.
Resolved That this convention appeals to all
people who love liberty to contribute gener
ously to the fund for the Boer wounded and an
ambulance corps. I
Resolved That copies of these resoluUons be
sent to President Kruger, President Steyn and
Dr Leyd and our Senators and Representatives
in 'Congress, and that they be furnished to the
daily press.
John Ganey moved the immediate adop
tion of the resolutions, but William Brod
erick objected to the part asking that the
United States stop the war. The conven
tion, he said, was a very small body and
was perhaps assuming too much when It
requested this Government to step in.
"Ths best way to stop this war, said
Judge Cooney amid laughter, "is to ask
Kruger to enforce peace. England can't ;
and Kruger must dictate. Of course we
are a small part of the population, but
mass meetings to express Boer sympathy
are being held everywhere and our voice
should be added. .We but express the
sentiments of citizens of every other
nationality, except the full fledged Eng-
Delegate Conniffe said the resolutions
just as they stood were nothing to be
ashamed of.
"I think what we ought to do." said
Judge Ferral. amid more laughter, "is
to express sympathy for old England. /I
always believe in sympathizing with the
under dog in a fight. That's the only ob
jection I see to adopting the resolutions
as they stand." Â¦
John J. Barrett made a stirring speech
upholding the Boers and saying that
strong and concise resolution* should be
adopted.
On motion of M. J. Gorman the resolu
tions were adopted as read, with the un
derstanding that another set, more brief
but just as strong, should be prepared for
reading St. Patrick's night. L. C. Cnopius,
L. K. Van Eaggen and Theodore Plnther
of the California Transvaal relief commit
tee also addressed the assemblage.
The executive committee will meet again
on Thursday night.

HIS COMPANION IN THE BOAT
BARELY SAVED.
Tlie Youth Carried Sixty Cartridges
and His Feet Were Tangled
in a String of
Decoys.
?
"Weighted with sixty shotgun cartridges
and with his feet tangled in a string of
decoys, Wallace Anderson, a 19-year-old
youth of this city, sank to his death in
the muddy waters of San Pablo Bay, near
Ellis Landing, yesterday morning.
The drowned boy lived at 330 Brann.in
street. He left here Saturday evening ; in
company, .with two other youths, John
Casey of 156 South Park and George Long,
who lives on Harrison street, near Fourth,
to go duck-shooting in the bay. The trio
spent the night at San Pablo, and yester
day morning at 7 o'clock started out after
ducks. .
The young men procured two boats.
Long got Into one of these alone and An
derson and Casey took the other. Their
boat was noticed, to be old add leaky, but
was not thought unsafe by them. As al
ready stated, Anderson had sixty shotgun
shells on his person. They. were in a bolt
about his body and made quite a weight.
He was further encumbered: by a heavy
hunting coat. .:".'../.. a--'. r.
The hunters pushed off- and had not pro
ceeded far up the, bay when the boat con
taining the. two began to leak badly. The
water came in faster than' it 1 could be
bailed, out, and the ; boys saw they could
not reach shore before it sank. They
called to Long, but before he could reach
them their craft had gone down.'
The minute the boat sank Anderson dis
appeared. His feet were tangled in the
decoys and he could not swim. Long
reached the place in time to extend an
oar to Casey, who was still! struggling in
the water..
Anderson's body was : recovered later on
with grappling hooks, the water being but
eight feet deep where he was drowned.
The body will be brought to this city to
day. rtiffflW Â»ti"TfH jggMfflff m.fll* Wtf tJ WW Vjn sfjjrj ijj

THE Emanu-El Sisterhood may
be proud of itself. By a single
benefit at the Columbia Theater
last night over $6000 poured into
the treasury, and it was all the result
of an amateur performance and the
proceeds of a programme larded with
advertisements that realized Just $1500
to the organization.
From pit and boxes to the upper
most gallery the theater was packed
with an audience of the grand-opera
type so far as dress was concerned.
Some seats represented double eagles,
others an individual bird. In the gal
lery, which was crowded, the seats
brought just $1. The spirit of charity
was the drawing card, and the show
itself counted not a whit. But not a
number on the programme went with
out its meed of deserved applause,
and encores were frequent and given
with a lusty vigor.
The character of the entertainment
was distinctly vaudeville. Opening
with a comedietta, the gamut of spe
cialty work was run to coon dances,
songs and instrumental musical va
garies. George Lask was the "control
ling genius, supervising the stage
work and directing the progress of the
show. Leon S. Greenebaum, the gen
eral manager of the benefit, watched
with keen eye for the financial end
and dreamed last night of a half
dozen thousands of dollars which the
sisterhood now possesses as a new in
crement to its assets. The audience
was more or less a large theater
party, caring little for the inexperi
ence of the ushers and the quality of
the entertainment. Some who held
checks to front-row seats were placed
in the rear of the dress circle, but
there was a general reciprocity, and
no "kicks" were registered at the box
office. The ushers, besides their du
ties of seating the audience, bore the
society man's burden of packing floral
pieces to the front. In this act Joe
Greenebaum and Mell Schweitzer were
the particularly radiant stars.
The programme was run in olios, the
ing by a squad consisting of Sergeant
Patrick Shea. Patrolmen Thomas E. Mur.

VTlthln the last ten days no tevrer than
eight deaths have occurred In Chinatown,
the circumstances surrounding each case
being of so mysterious a nature that the
police are leaving no stone unturned to
discover the cause. All the deceased
Chinese became afflicted while residing in
the lodging-house at 731 Washington
street or after coming in contact with one
of those who had been taken ill there, and
their countrymen have spirited the bodies
away so successfully that at the expira
tion of nearly two weeks the police find
themselves no closer to a solution of the
mystery than at the beginning.
About ten days ago a Chinese became
suddenly prostrated from some unknown
malady in the lodging-house and died In
a. short time. Later in the day two more
<_.iinese took to their beds and succumbed,
their illness being accompanied by the
same symptoms as In the case of the first
unfortunate. An hour after the third man
had passed away another Chinese dropped
dead in the corridor of the building.
The Chinese immediately spirited the
bodies away and their whereabouts is not
known to any but two or three Mongo
lians. On the following day a fourth man
bad to be removed to the terrible "Cham
bers of Tranquillity," and these formed
the subject or investigation by Acting
Chief Bipry, In which that official dis
tinguished himself and took steps to put
an end to the Chinese method of treat
ing what they regarded as incurable
cases, so far as this city is concerned.
When this sufferer died the Board of
Health announced its intention of clean
ing out Chinatown and making the Ce
lestials pay more attention to hygienic
laws. Their intention will doubtless tie
strengthened by the fact that a day or
two ago the Chinese physician who at
tended the sufferer taken to the "Cham
bers of Tranquillity" died suddenly, and
his remains were also hidden. Yesterday
two nun living in the name house with
this physician also sickened and died.
Their bodies were removed before the po
lice obtained news of their demise and
cannot be found.
The knowledge of these peculiar deaths
came to the police from an aged Chinese
living in the lodging house at 731 Wash
ington street, who declared that his coun
trymen were very much perturbed by
what had takon place and that all the
lodgers were leaving the house where he
was living. The old fellow appeared to
be very nervous and said he intended to
move a.= soon as he could gather his ef
fects together.
Last evening a member of the
Board of Health paid an official visit
to Chinatown to investigate the cases
brought to his attention by the Police
Department. His report to the board will
be made to-day. Acting Chief Biggy Is
determined to ferret out the mystery. He
has several detectives at work trying to
locate the remains of the Chinese who
died in the lodging house and at the house
of the Chinese physician who treated the
Fufferer resigned to his fate In the
"Chambers of Tranquillity."
