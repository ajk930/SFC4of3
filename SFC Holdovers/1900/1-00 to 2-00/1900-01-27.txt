The leading party men of Palo Alto

of the Mexican. The- president and sec
retary of the â¢ Republican Club for - the
past year were against Burns, -but would
say nothing for publication, as they did
not want their names used. Were it not

PALO ALTO, Jan. 26.â Prominent
professors among the faculty were
seen and in every case expressed
themselves as unqualifiedly opposed
to the election of Burns to the United
States Senate.
David Starr Jordan, president of Stan
ford University, said that he could be put
down as not only against Burns for the
Senate, but also opposed to an extra ses
sion. He believed that the money it would
cost the people would be worse than
wasted. In addition to the cost we must
figure upon the ignominy it would bring
upon us.
Professor George M. Richardson, head
of the department of physics, expressed
himself as follows: "I am against the
election of Burns to the Senate. He is
not a representative man and has noth
ing to recommend him. I voted for Gage,
but in the light of present events I must
say that I regret it."

coming to California early In the forties.
For the past ten years he has been a
resident of Santa Clara County and an
active member in politics. When asked
his opinion concerning Burns and the ex
tra session he expressed himself freely.
"I think that the election of Dan Burns
would be the worst calamity that could
befall not only to the Republican party
of this State but all the people of Cali
fornia as well. It means that we spend
$200,000 in electing a Senator and then
EUREKA.
EUREKA. Jan. 26.â J. w. Henderson,
president of the llumboldt County
Bankâ l believe that the election of
Burns to the United States Senate
would seriously impair the strength of the
Republican party In the State. If the ex
tra session results in the selection of some
other good Republican I should say the
move would be a good one for the party.
W. N. Speegle, manager Dally Standard-
Republicans of this section do not regard
Burns' candidacy with favor. I hope some
one else will be chosen, as the interests of
the party demand that a man be sent to
the Senate who has the confidence of the
whole people. In the event of Burns being
defeated the extra session will do the
party no harm.
P.. 8e11, lumbermanâ Any one but Burns.
His election would mean the defeat of the
party at the next election.- If it turns out
that* the session was not called in his in
terest it will be a good thing for the party
and will dispose of vexatious questions.
Dr. W. H. Wallaceâ Dan Burns is a per
sonal friend of mine, but I recognize the
fact that he Is less popular in this county
than any other candidate.
F. W. Georgeson, cashier Humboldt
County Bankâ The selection of Burn 3
would be suicidal. MÂ«Kinley Is as popular
as any living man. but the State would go
against him if Dan Burns is sent to the
Senate. ." _ ;. : *
E. W. Haight, merchantâ The people do
not favor Burns. That fact can be easily
ascertained by a little investigation, and
for the sake of the party I should not like
to see him sent to the Senate. In case
some other man is selected I believe the
extra session will not injure the chances
of the party next fall.
D. R. Georgeson â The sentiment is prac
tically all against Burns. It will be a sad
mistake if he is selected Senator.
W. S. Clark, capitalistâ l will be strong

an understanding exists and
an Interesting session will ensue. I
am not in favor of the election of Burn 3
to the United States Senate, and if after
the balloting it is evident that a Repub
lican candidate cannot be elected and tha
conditions are favorable, I will favor the
election of a reputable Democrat, such as
ilarion tie Vries. I will not go into a
caucus except it be one of the whole In
which it is intended that a candidate will
be decided upon or an anti-Burns caucus
to see where we stand. I do not think;
Burns stands a show.
Frank Kgan, County Committeeman
and Fostmaaterâ lt is dUflcult to say that
the reasons cited by Gage for the calling
or the extra session are not sufficient,
but the election of a Senator seems para
mount. I am unalterably opposed to the
election of Burns and do not believe that
Gage should be allowed to pay his politi
cal obligations in this manner. I think
that there are enough conservative Demo
crats in the legislative body to control the
vote on another than Burns, in the event
of the Republican members agreeing upon
a candidate.
Dr. C. D. Smith, proprietor Calaveras
Hotel â The reasons given by Governor
Gage for the assembling of the Legisla
ture in extraordinary session are simply
a ruse and are all summed up in the
firstâ the election of a United States Sena
tor. It has put an unnecessary expense
upon the State and if Burns is sent to
the Senate it will be a disgrace.
S. A. Hoffman, proprietor of the Angels
Recordâ lt is an outrage on the people
to have a Governor that can be used for
such a purpose.
John Davey, proprietor cf the White
House â If both Gage and Burns were in
Hades the people would be better off. The
extra session is a scheme on Its face and
a disgrace.
John Carleyâ Governor Gage's reasons
for calling the extra session are a subter
fuge and the election of Dan Burns will
mean the political death of the Republi
can party In this State.
E. I. Thomasâ The extra session i 3 not

people of this State. Burns is a disgrace
to the State and the scheme to elect him
should be stopped.
W. E. Harryâ Gage was not Justified in
calling the extra session. He is a Burns
man and his call is but the attempt to
pay a political debt.
William Thomasâ lt Is not right that
Gage should be allowed to foist a man
like Burns on the people by calling an
extra session, using such reasons as he
does for the purpose.

SANT JOSE, Jan. 16â Gage's proposi
tion to convene the State Legisla
ture in special session for the pur
pose of electing Dan Burns Senator
is not receiving much support from Re
publicans, and especially is it condemned
among farmers and horticulturists, whe
look upon it as a wasteful expenditure ol
the people's money.
Judge J. R. Lewis, one of the most
prominent Republicans In the countyâ l
think the calling of an extra session ol
the LÂ» gislature wholly unnecessary. The
;>n-ie:;ses set forth In the call are wholly
without foundation and are a humbug.
The central idea of it ail is the hope<l-foi
election of Dan Burns to the United
States Senate. Gage deferred the call un
til he saw there was no hope of Quay
being seated and that he could not ap-
P'.lnt Burns, and after lie was sure his
Mexican friend would be elected. At the
com:ng election th*> Republican party of
this county will make no mistake and will
not re-elect any of those who vote for
Burns. Gages action will most likely
make California I>< mocratie next year.
D. H. Bryantâ The extra session will
jprove a calamity to the Republican party
in this county. It is a well-known fact
"' t '-Z-Z Â¦â¢Â¦ t-tHy rc-iwirJii for assembling

itf- guii-<- of the need of the enactment of

O. D. Blaneyâ There is no necessity for

travagance. The election of Burns
prompted Gage in the matter. Burns is
Dot a lit representative for California in

J. 11. Koerbor â An extra srsMon was not

A. T. Herrmannâ lt is humbug for Gage

Cttjr Attorney Bcaslyâ it is unfortunate
that the legislature in the last regular

Ir.g c.->cu-d. is received very unfavorably
here, most Republicans considering the
move a very unwise one. and the general
opinion is that nothing beneficial will re
sult. The following opinions from the
leading Republicans of this county repre
acci IM views of the people:
Chairman K. M. P> le of the County
Central Committeeâ The call for a special
*e*sion is unnecessary, uncalled for, mil
the t-lertion of Dan Hums to the United
Â£>tatfÂ« Senate would be a disgrace to civ
ilization and the defeat of the Republican
jjarty in thl* State for years.
District Attorney EL \V. S'juicrâ The ac
tiun of Governor Gage in regard to the
Â«x:ra session is unwise, and Dan Burns
Ik not a suitable man for the position of
h*-nator.
City Attorney 11. C. Boothâ lf the extra
Ksslon is spent in needed legislation, such
as a new street improvement act to ovor
c me the constitutional objections to the
present law, 1 believe me expense of hoiÂ«l
ing th* session will be money well sprnt.
1 see no reason why Mr. Burns would
not make an energetic and capable Sen
ator. Of his character I Know nothing ex
cept what 1 have read in the newspapers.
Jerorar C. Wilsonâ l believe the call for

needless expense, and Dan Burns Is not
the man the people of the State want for

W. P. Butcherâ l believe the call for a

SAN JOSE.
Dan Burns
Is Too
Heavy a
Burden
for the Repub
lican Party
of California
to Carry.
Leading Republicans Throughout the State Declare the Mexican Unfit to
Represent This Empire in the Senate of the United States-
His Election Woulci Be a Disgrace.
DAN BURNS is not wanted by the people of California to represent them' in the upper house of the national legislature. This has been amply demon
strated in the columns of The Call on numerous occasions: To ascertain if there had been any change in the sentiment of the people. on the Senatorial
question The Call instructed its correspondents in fifty cities of the State to interview, without discrimination, ten leading Republicans as to the wis
dom of the call for the extra session and the fitness of the Mexican for the Senatorial toga. The responses printed below show most conclusively that the better
element of the State is unalterably and unmistakably opposed to the pretensions of Gage's political creator, and regards the many reasons advanced by the Gov
ernor for convening the Legislature in extraordinary session as only a subterfuge to elevate Burns to the Senatorship. The majority strongly denounce the
Governor in no uncertain terms for the special summons, and unqualifiedly declare that he is not conducting his office with much consideration for the inter
ests of his party. They assert that the work cut out for the extra session should have been performed last winter, and that the State will not be compensated
one tithe for the heavy tax the session will entail. Only a few approve the move of the Governor. They do so on the ground that the State is entitled to
two Senators at Washington, and the call is, therefore, proper in order to obtain full representation. A mere handful go on record as favoring Burns. They
are blind to the rascality of a man with a reputation so besmirched that all the waters of old ocean could not cleanse it, and have the temerity to pronounce
him a decidedly proper person. The expressions of many, who are citizens of high standing in their respective towns, are an ominous warning to the solons
who gather at Sacramento on Monday next. They see in the Governor's wordy call only a disgraceful scheme to boost the Mexican into the Senatorship, and
unhesitatingly declare that it will be detrimental to the best interests of the Republican party. If the conspiracy be carried to a successful termination it will
seriously impair the strength of the party in the State, and so disgust the people that the outrage will be resented in a most decisive manner at the polls when
the next election occurs.
CALIFORNIA LIFTS HER MIGHTY VOICE AGAINST BURNS
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 2S.â A number of
prominent Republicans Interviewed
here to-day regarding the wisdom
Â» of an extra session and the pro
posed scheme to elect Burns Senator ex
pressed themselves as being strongly
against the move.
W. J. Eardley, one of the directors of
the Agricultural Fair Association and a
well-known Insurance man, said: "Tha
extra session ia bound to cost the people
of this State an immerse amount of
money and I fail to see any necessity
which justifies it. Burns Is certainly not
my choice as Senator, but there seems to
be little doubt that he Is the man to oc
cupy the position. The party co*uld better
aflord to do without a Senator than bear
the burden of an extra session.
Henry G. Hahman, the well-known sta
tioner, expressed himself along similar
lines. He said: "The extra session means
that thousands and thousands of dollars
will be spent for which the people will
get little If any returns. Had the Legis
lature done its duty last winter It would
have elected a Senator then. No Gover
nor of this State ever called a special ses
sion of the Legislature yet without regret
ting It and I fear the present case will
prove no exception."
L. X. Hitchcock, chairman of the Re"' 1
publican County Central Committee, sai
that while he might have a private opin
ion regarding: the matter he had none for
publication and declined to be interviewed.
A. B. Lemmon also begged to be t ac
cused.
Rev. W. L. Gaston, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, had no hesitation about
expressing himself and said: "I am free
to admit that the only reason I can sen
for this special session is a background
In which Burns looms up an uncanny as
pirant for the Senatorship. The people
do not want him on moral grounds. Brig
ham H. Roberts is to be preferred."
C. E. Haven, captain, commanding'
Company E: "The whole thing is a
scheme of the railroad to elect Burns to
the Senate. If Quay had been seated no
extra session would have been held, for
Gage would have appointed Burns direct.
Governor Gage was elected by the people
of California, but 1 am sorry to say that
I think he pays more attention to other
things than to their interests. He is cer
tainly not conducting his office with much
consideration for the interests of his
party."
Dr. C. 11. Thompsonâ l hope to see the
time when Senators are elected by direct
vote of the people and such affairs as this
are no longer possible. 1 believe we
should have another Senator. We are
entitleJ to the honor, but would be bet
ter off without It than represented by an
unsatisfactory man. I do not favor
Burns. \V c want a man who can repre
sent the State as she should be represent
ed. The extra session will prove a costly
affair in more ways than one, I fear.

there Is nothing that would warrant such
action. His reasons are flimsy on the face
Â«f them and it is evident that he has
beÂ«n forced to give way to the inevitable
and pay his political obligations. If his
scheme carries and Dan Burns Is elected
to the Senate of the United States. It
will be a standing and burning disgrace
to the State. This State needs a Sena
tor badly, but It would be better off with
out one "than to send a man like Burns to
represent it.
LAKEFORT, Jan. 26.-W. L. Rldeout.
Editor Bee â Governor Gage un
doubtedly understands the sltua-
tion. I am satisfied that a Senator
will be elected or he would not have called
the Â«_xtra session. If the Legislature does
cxpeditiously its work the State and party
will be benefited. I know nothing of Col
onel Burns except through hearsay. But
the fact that his own neighbors speak well
cf him convinces me that he is not half as
black as painted. I am satisfied that our
kÂ£it>iatcrs will do their duty.
A. Levy, Merchant â Governor Gage in
calling tne Legislature in extra session
iisis made a mistake. His actiun is only
carrying out a job to elect Dan Burns
Jjeiiator. He would not be in any eer.se a
lit man to represent the interest of the
j.'eople of <"aJilornla. The scheme, if car
ried through, will be acaiust the interests
of the Republican party.
Frank liuwe. Republican County Central
Committee â I believe the only purpose of
calling- the extra session was a scheme to
elect Dan Burns United States Senator.
Am first and last opposed to him. Believe
me vacancy bhould tie lllled, but by a bet
ter man.
Cieorge Lyon, Supervisorâ An extra ees
tion is entirely unnecessary. The reasons
Civen by Gage can be htld over lor the
next regular session. The conduct of
L'urns while Secretary of State should
forever debar him from favorable indorse
ment by the people of California. 1 want
a better man for Senator, tcott preferred.
A E. Norrisâ There was no absolute ne
cessity of calling an extra session. We
had enough of the regular session. I have
never been in favor of Mr. Burae for Sen
ator, but do want sume gooU man elected
to till the vacancy.
6. S. Russell, County Assessor â The call
ing of thtvLegislature in extra session waa
unwise. The reasons given by Gage are a
mere covering of the scheme to elect Dan
Burns Senator. 1 dv not believe our rep
resentatives at Sacramento will ignore
the sentiment against Burns and some
good man will be elected.
A. H. Deputyâ A number of reasons are
civ.n by Governor Gage for calling the
Legislature in extra session, but sim
mered down there Is but one reasonâ that
cf electing Burns United States Senator.
Burns* name is bad. Always to beat his
fellow man is his record, and he would
follow his bent toward the people of Cali
fornia if ejected.
W. E. Greene, bank cashierâ l am dis
appointed in Governor Gage. He should
not have called an extra session of the
Legislature. California- would be better
off twice over with a vacancy than to
nave a man with the record of Dan Burns
as Lnited States Senator.
William Appleton, merchantâ l do not
think that the needs of California at the
X'resent time require an extra session of
the Legislature. All the reasons given
r>y the Governor for his action appear only
to be a subterfuge to elevate Dan Burns.
To elect such a man United States Sena
tor would be an outrage on the decent
minded people of California.
M S. Sayre. District Attorneyâ l realize
the Importance of having a Senator elect
ed, but aid not favor calling a special ses
sion for that purpose. However, since it
ha f, , been called I hope the Legislature
wil' have the good sense to elect a Senator
promptly and transact such other busi
ness as may be necessary and adjourn
without delay.
licanâ l believe the reasons given for the
calling of the extra session are a blind,
the main purpose being to elect Dan
Burns Senator. While 1 know nothing
against Burns, I believe that if he is
elected at this session it means some one
has got some dough, and if elected it will
work a great injury to the Republican
party at the next election.
D. S Blackburn, a retired capitalist and
Influential Republicanâ lt is an outrage.
The election of Burns would be a greater
outrage on the people of this State. Gage
has made a monstrous ass of himself.
Gage will lose, if he has not already lost,
all his influence in this county.
E. S. Hall, Chairman County Republican
Central Committeeâ "l think there was no
er>ing need of the session, although the
State should have two Senators. It Is
very bad policy to call an extra session
without absolute knowledge that a Sena
tor could be elected. Unless the Governor
knows by a canvass that a Senator can
be elected it was impolitic to call the Leg
islature together. If a Senator can be
elected, then the Governor is Justified."
Hall, however, is strongly opposed to
"Mxtcan" Dan Burns, in common with
other Republicans. He believes a better
man should be selected.
Postmaster C. D. Bonestellâ "Gage did
rieht. The State should have another
MERCED. Jan. rG.-J. w. Knox.
chairman of the County Republi
can Central Committeeâ The ex
tra eesslon is not for the interest
of the taxpayers of this State, but was
called by the Governor sfmply to i>lÂ«ct
Dan Burns Senator. Burns has the power
to rule Gage, and nt his request the Gov
ernor called the extra session, for it was
believed that they had secured enough
votes to capture the Senatorship. I believe
the extra session Is unnecessary and that
it is an imposition to put the taxpayers to
this unnecessary expense.
A. Delongâ l don't believe the Governor
ehould have called this extra session and
cause this expense, that the taxpayers
will have to meet, for it will take some
time for them to decide who will repre
eent California in the Senate. Dan Burns
no matter how hard he may try, will ro t
be elected, and It Is my opinion that thore
are thousands of men In the State far
better fit to represent it than he. and Cali
fornia, would derive no good through elect
ing r.'.in.
Dr. H. Delossâ l am in favor of the ex
tra session of the Legislature which was
called by Governor Gage, for I beliove
that the question of who is to represer.t'us
in the Senate at Washington should be
settled. In my opinion Dan Burns has a
pood chance for the place. The extra seÂ«-
Bion was surely called by Gage at the re
quest of Burns, who would be favored f.ir
the aid he rendered Gage in the last cam-
Senator. I believe in a caucus, when the
lowest man on each succeeding ballot
should be dropped till a Republican Sena
tor is selected/ Bonestell is not a Burns
man. He prefers other timber.
F. S. Ccok. ex-Town Marshal and a Re
publican leader in local politicsâ l believe
that the calling of the session is justified,
provided a Senator is elected. Opposition
should unite against Burns, who is not
the choice of the people of this State and
certainly not of this county. Burns
should not force himself upon the people
when he surely knows he is not their
choice.
MODESTO, Jan. 26.â W. W. Thomp
sonâl believe that an extra ces
sion of the Legislature Is en
tirely uncalled for at present, and
It â¢will be a disgrace to the Republican
party and the State to elect Dan Burns
United States Senator.
W. E. Dauntâ l am opposed to the elec
tion of Dan Burns United States Senator,
and in my opinion an extra session of '. c
Legislature is unnecessary.
A. McAllister â The Legislature had am
ple time to elect a United States Sena
tor at the regular ression. I am opposed
to an extra session and the election of

and consternation were on the face of 1
every Republican. Republican sentiment 1
is almost unanimous against an extra ses

"crow feast," and asking if the Gage-
Burns circus would show in Sacramento

R. Bard of Hueneme. The following
prominent Republicans of this city were
Interviewed to-night and their sentiments
are generally against "Mexican Dan":
Mayor J. S. Collins, Trustee Los Angeles
State Normal Schoolâ "Personally I think
that the calling cf an extra session is
needless and greatly Impolitic, especially
if Dan Burns is to be elected. I cannot
imagine why an extra session should be
called. It will harm Gage and certainly
not do him any good." Mayor Collins was
emphatic in his denunciations of Gover

Frank E. Barnard, a prominent Repub-
AUBURN, Jan. 26.-Professor W.-M
Mackay-I believe everything has
been aufflclently greased to elect
Dan Burns. Otherwise the extra session
would not hare been called. However
In either event, I am fearful of the legis

C. W. Morrowâ This. extra session, par

PLACERVILLE.
PLACERVILLE, Jan. 26.â Judge Fred
Adams, one of the most prominent
attorneys of this city and a Repub-
lican from the foundation of the
party and prominent for nearly forty
Â¦years in party councils, saidâ As a general
rule I am opposed to extra sessions of the
Legislature. The history of extra ses
sions in the past has been that they have
been utter failures for the purpose for
which they have been called. I am not
In favor of the election of Colonel D. M.
Burns to the United States Senate, neither
do I favor the election of U. S. Grant Jr.
I think the best Interests of the party
would be best subserved by the election
of. an entirely new man â one of proper
ability and largely Interested in the pros
perity of the State. Thomas R. Bard of
Ventura I believe to be such a man and
I think no better choice could be made.
George A. Richardson, secretary of the
Republican County Central Committee
and for seventeen years the editor and
proprietor of the Republican, the leading
Republican newspaper In the county â I
recognize in Colonel D. M. Burns a man
who has been a potent factor in Republi
can party success in this State, but be
lieve that party harmony would be best
promoted by the selection of a new man
for the Senate. From a partisan stand
point, the calling of an extra session may
result in an advantage to the Republican
national administration if it results in tho
election of a United States Senator. On
the other hand, the extra session is ex
tremely hazardous to the welfare of the
party in the next two campaigns in this
State. If the session is unduly prolonged
or if it results In the election of a Senator
whom the people generally will condemn
it is reasonable to conclude that they will
hold the Republican party responsible for
the actions which they disapprove. I am
personally opposed to the election of D.
M. Burns, because I feel certain that it
will weaken the strength- of the party in
this State.
W. F. Falrchild, a leading druggist of
this city â Extra sessions have been fail
ures In the past. I hope this one will not
be 60. I am opposed to the election of
Colonel D. M. Burns to the Senate. I
hope to see a Republican elected who will
command the respect of the entire State
and will harmonize the party.
John P. Fisher, County Clerkâ l believe
that we should have a Senator, and, of
course, the extra session Is the only way
to secure one. I am opposed to the elec
tion of Colonel Burns â would like to see
Irving M. Scott or Horace Davis elected.
Dr. S. H. Rantzâ l don't think there was
any call for an extra session at this time
and I think the Governor Is entailing
needless expense upon the people of the
State. I am decidedly opposed to Dan M.
Burns for the United States Senate â think
it better that the State should continue
unrepresented than to suffer the calamity
of his election.
John P. G. Miller, a prominent attorney
and feadlng Republicanâ There was no
necessity for an extra session at this time
and the Governor's proclamation came as
a surprise to me. 1 am unalterably op
posed to the election of Dan Burns to
the United States Senate.
M. Q. Meehan, a leading hardware mer
chant and prominent in local Republican
politicsâ l think the calling of an extra
session at this time was a mistake. I
am opposed to the election of Colonel
Burns to the Senate of the United States.
Theodore Schaub, one of the best-known
Republicans In the county and one of the
proprietors of the Ohio, the leading hotel
of this city â Extra sessions of the Cali
fornia Legislature have In the past been
costly failures to the people of the State.
Believing in party harmony, I do not
favor the election of Colonel D. M. Burns
to the United States Senate.

\/\/ "Walker, secretary Republican
* ~ Central Committeeâ lt seems
to me that the Governor of the
State should know whether or not mat
ters to come before the Legislature are of
sufficient Importance to Justify calling an
extra session. So far as the Senatorshlp
is concerned I think there are Republi
cans in reach who would please the peo
ple better than Burns.
H. W. Elliottâ l hardly think the extra
session should have been called. I am de
cidedly opposed to having Burns elected
Senator.
J. H. Graves, Auditor and Recorder of
Glenn Countyâ lf the Legislature can
elect a Senator. I am in favor of the ex
tra session. Ido not know Burnsâ in fact
have never seen him â but from what I
have heard about him I think it would
be better for the State not to send him
to the Senate.
I. V. Devenpeck, prominent land own
erâl do not think the session will amount
to much. I do not think Burns will be
elected, and, furthermore, I do not think
a mistake to elect him as Senator.
Judge H. C. Lillleâ An extra session is
all right. But Burns is not the man for
Senator. It will be a great blow to the
Republican party if he Is elected.
J. V. Huffakerâ The calling of a spe
cial session Is bad political policy. Burns
is a rascal. He should not be elected.
There are too many bad men in office al
ready.
A LAMEDA, Jan. 26.â T. Carpenter,
/-\ Veterinary Inspector Alamedaâ
r~ -*- The calling of the extra session
Is indeed a serious mistake. It is
a mistake because we are on the eve of
a Presidential campaign and our oppo
nents will make the most out of It. To
elect Dan Burns will only make matters
ten times worse. Complications will be
sure to follow this untimely action. The
wisdom of the managers of the RepubÂ«
Hcan party ought to prevail and prevent
any further mistakes. The people do not
want Burns, and he knows it.
George E. Clarke â Gage has done more
injury to the Republican party by this
last freak of his than anything else I
know of could do. It Is simply idiotic.
The Burns iniluence must be tremendous
to sway a man to betray his party in
the way Gage has. It will certainly do us
a great deal of harm.
E. A. Randlettâ l am afraid the Repub
lican party is going to pay dearly for this
extra session in more ways than one. It
seems to have been called for the pur
pose of electing Dan B.urns and nothing
else. There Is no other good reason why
it should have been convened. This ac.
tion on the part of Gage will have Its ef
fect when the Presidential election takes
place.
Captain J. C. Hanleyâ We certainly
don't want a man like Dan Burns for
Senator of this State. He is too repug
nant. He may be a bright man In his
way, but It is not the right way. We
know too much of his record. Some one
who has a moral character at least ought
to be elected Senator. I don't want to
see any one that Gage favors get into a
high office. As to his calling an extra
session, I think that it was done for
Burns' benefit, and that the Republican
party will pay the piper.
Joseph F. Forderer, City Trusteeâ l
think the sentiment of the Republican
party, rank and file, Is against Dan Burns.
If a popular vote were asked he would
be snowed under. Therefore, it would
seem to be for the best Interests of the
party to elect some fit man. We have
plenty of material in this State and ought
to have two good Senators. This extra
session is going to do the party Immense
harm. The party managers will soon flnd
that they have made a serious mistake.
SONORA, Jan. 26.â Republicans of
Tuolumne County condemn the ac
tion of the Governor in calling an
extra session, believing it has been
called in the Interest of Burns, whom they
do not think the proper man for Senator.
Barnes, Scott or Estee would give entire
satisfaction. ,<-.:Â¦ ... â¢
TULARE. Jan. 26.â 1 believe the cull

I am of the opinion that all will be well
if it ends wellâ lf the Legislature holds a
short session, gives deserved attention to
the measures submitted by the Governor

man who stands well in the estimation of
the people. The Legislature and the Gov

tute a disaster to the Republican party

B. F. Snell, merchantâ Am not a Dan

good men to send one like Burns to Wash

elected to help Senator Perkins uphold
the administration on the part or our
State, ar.d therefore I have felt no objec

LOS GATOS. Jan. 26.â John C. Worth
âThe calling of the extra session of
the Legislature is tho most trans

United States Senator I will be ashamed

California in the United States Senate.
C. F. Lacey, chairman of the Republi
can Central Committeeâ From a political
standpoint the calling of an extra session
is unwise in the extreme. The Republi
cans of this county are a unit against the
Senatorial aspirations of D. M. Burns.
They would not approve, but would con
demn any act or vote of their representa
tive (Senator Flint) In caucus or out of
caucus which would add to Burns' chance
of success, but they have no fears of
"Tom" voting wrong.
J. R. Hebbron said he thought It was a
good idea to call an extra session: that
California should be represented by an
other Senator, but that he did not know
whether the best man would be elected
or not.
Coroner 11. V. Muller asserted that the
whole affair of calling an extra session
as well as the scheme to elect Dan Burns
was highway robbery and should not be

Postmaster John R. Joy believes that It
is the universal opinion of all the Repub
licans in this community that Burns
should not be elected Senator. He did
not believe that the representatives who
voted against Burns the last time would
change this session.
Many other prominent lights in the Re
publican party in this county who could
not be seen to-night have given the un
qualified opinion that Burns should not
be elected. Others have signified their in

Flint urging him to vote against the Mex

VISALIA, Jan. 26.â E. M. Jefferds,
County Auditorâ lt Is a mistake to
call a special session if the object
is to elect Burns to the Senate.
Burns can't be elected squarely and fair
ly. There are plenty of good men avail
able who would give general satisfaction.
J. E. Denny, County Treasurerâ l am in
favor of Burns. He ought to be elected
Senator. I think his services to the party
entitle him to credit and recognition at
this time.
George G. Murray, Deputy District At

ought to have the place. Anybody but
Burns would suit the Republicans.
Charles G. Lamberson, chairman Re
publican County Central Committeeâ So
far as I am concerned I do not now think
and never have thought there was any
occasion for calling an extra session of
the Legislature. It is a bad political
move. The election of Dan Burns to be
Senator would be a great blow to the Re
publican party of this State and. would
certainly lose us the next Legislature.
John O. Thomas, County Recorderâ lt
Is unwise to call a special session of the
Legislature. I don't want to see Burns
elected. He may be a good man, but his
reputation is notoriously bad.
W. S. Hayesâ l know Burns personally
He hasn't the ability to be Senator. He's
nothing but a political schemer and

O. R. Crossâ l am against Dan Burns

A. G. Wishonâ lt will be very unfortu

necessary. For Senator I prefer Burns.
County Surveyor Westonâ l think the
calling of an extra session nothing but a

Dr. F. X. Tremblay. who always takes

A D. Mason, attorneyâ While popular

me best of any man I have heard men

Charles E. Mulloy, merchantâ l think it
plain that the extra session Is an unneces

National Senate, and it is not urgent that
the Republicans of California elect a sec
ond member just now, especially as Sena
tor Perkins has so notably demonstrated
his ability to care for the Interests of the
State in Congress. If Burns should be
elected Senator we could not hope to
carry the State for the Republican party

Burns victory would throw Nevada

J. G. O'Neill, principal city schoolsâ lt la

If the State has to suffer because it is

publican party has a duty to perform in
sending a Senator to Washington, and
on that score is justified in the extra
session. As for myself, I can mention
no favorite for the place.
E. M. Leitchâ l believe we should be
represented with another Senator in
Washington, and if the Legislature will
select a gocd man, and stop at that. I
shall not be opposed to the extAi ses
sion.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 26.â D. C. Collierâ
I think the call is a disastrous
thing for the party, and the elec
tion of Burns will be worse. Though I
personally do not believe that Burns is
as black as he Is sometimes painted, his
very many political enemies in the i.Â«.e
publican party will disrupt that har
mony which Is necessary to success.
D. Gochenauerâ l am a believer in the
idea that there should be at Washing
ton all the representation that this State
is entitled to, and that, therefore, the
call is a wise move that gives us the
representation. That the Senator shouid
be Burns I do not say. As a Callfornlan,
I say that Burns is better than no Sena-
MARYSVILLE.
MARYSVILLE. Jan. 16.â H. B. P.
Cardenâ ln convening the Legis
lature Governor Gage did nothing
more than bow to the will of the
people, and his action should meet with
the approval of every loyal Republican.
I am of the opinion that much good will
come from the extra session. It certainly
was the only thing to be done from a
Republican standpoint.
W H. Parksâ We elected our legislators
in the belief that they are competent to
attend to the duties of their position and
to do the best for their constituents. Ihe
majority favored the convening of the ex
tra session, and for that reason I do not
believe we should find fault with the ac
tion of Governor Gage. If the Legislature
will do the proper thing by this section as
regards the office of Commissioner of
Public Works the people of Marysville
will not have a fault to find.
Richard Belcherâ lf the extra session
bring-s about no other result than the
election of a United States benator it will
fully compensate for the outlay it entails.
1 know none of the candidates for united
States Senator and do not care to express

Ex-Senator F. H. Greely-I think a Re
publican Senator should be elected, and
if the extra session will accomplish that
end it will have done a good thing.
G W Hallâ As a Republican, with the
interests of his party at stake. I am glad
Governor Gage called the extra session.
1 have no choice for Senator. Elect some
good man. . , _
Martin Sullivanâ l believe the whole af
fair Is cut and dried, and any suggestion
1 mipht muke won't cut any tigure.
Wallace Dinsmore â The wisdom of call
ing an extra session will be apparent
when the work of the meeting is conclud
ed. I think the Republicans of Califor
nia will then realize that it was a good
move to convene it.
T. J. Sherwoodâ Failure to elect a Sena
tor last winter was eufficient of itself to
warrant convening the members of the
Legislature in extraordinary session. Be
cause the members of the Legislature
failed to perform their duty in 1899 is not
good reason for the Governor to fail to do
his duty in an effort to secure for Cali
fornia full representation in Congress. A
Senator should be chosen at once and ad
journment had as quickly as possible.
Burns is not objectionable to the people
of this county, and I think he has as good
claims as any man mentioned.

HANFORD. Jan. 26.â 1 am not a
Burns man and deprecate any
crhPinp to elect him. I would pre-
fer to see some one who was not
prominently before the last Legislature.
I believe M. H. de Young would make a
good Senator and one who would work
early and late for the interests of Cali
fornia, and that is what this State needs.
â B. L. Barney, ex-Supervisor.
I am in favor of an extra session of the
Legislature if we can elect some good Re
publican United States Senator. lam
not in favor of it if the same scenes of
the last Legislature are re-enacted, as it
would be a disgrace to the State of Cali
fornia.âJ. H. Dopkins.
I am not In favor of an extra session
of the Legislature and am not in favor of
Dan M. Burns for United States Senator.
I think we can get along with one Senator
until a regular session of the Legislature.
The calling of an extra session Is very un
wise.âDr. N. P. Duncan.
I think the scheme of calling an extra
session Is for the purpose of electing
Burns United States Senator. I hope this
Is not so, but those in the scheme prob
ably know what they were doing when
the' extra session was called. â A. Ayers,
Deputy Sheriff.
UKIAH, Jan. 2Câ Tour correspond
ent interviewed a large number of
prominent Republicans to-day re-
garding their Senatorial prefer
ences. While the almost universal senti
ment seems against D. M. Burns 'for the
high position, the gentlemen intervieweÂ«i
declined to make statements for publica
tion over their own signatures. This reti
cence may be accounted for on the ground
that a State institution Is located near
this city, and the patronage therefrom Is
more or less extensive. In the outlying
districts the sentiment against Mr. Burns
Is practically If not altogether unani
mous.
BERKELEY, Jan. 26. â George
Schmidtâ Personally speaking, I
have nothing to say either for or
against Mr." Burns. I would even
go further and say that I have no doubt
that he would be able to represent this
State in the Senate, if elected. Politically
speaking, I believe that Gage Is doing
only what he ought to do. Burns brought
him out of the brush and made him and
he is bound to carry out his pledge in re
turn. But, politically speaking again, if
the Republican party elects Burns all hell
can't beat the Democrats two years
henc*. The people of the State, rightly
or wrongly, will not tolerate it- His elec
tion, in other words, would be a disas
trous political blunder.
P. R. Booneâ Of course, every one knows
how Berkeley regards the candidacy of
Mr. Burns, and, like other Berkeley Re
publicans, I am opposed to his election.
This soems to be the attitude of the better
class of people throughout the State. Per
sonally I am in favor of Irving M. Scott.
He is a man used to succeed. He is fa
miliar with affairs in Washington and Is
a man of unblemished reputation. I am
patisfled that his election would pleaso
Berkeley.
W. R. Littleâ As the extra session is evi
dently but the means used by Gage to fill
his obligations to Burns I do not see why
the State should stand the immense ex
pense of an extra session. The election
of Burns would cause a scandal through
out the State.

NAPA, Jan. 25.â The extra session
has created a good deal of talk
here during the past two days'
among the Republican leaders. A can
vass among them has brought out i^e
fact that the Republican party in this
county Is opposed to the election of
Burns as Senator. They think that he
is an unfit man for the place. The senti
ment is that If Burns Is chosen it means
defeat for the party In this State next
November. Barham or Scott would be
acceptable to the Republican voters here.

W. J. Doherty, lumber dealerâ Down

Alex Ileyrnan, ex-secretary Republican
County Central Committee â There is no

scheme to elect I>an Burns. If for that.
It's a mistake. Burns is not wanted as
bad as we want two Senators. The people

LOS ANGELES.
BERKELEY.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.â Interviews
with prominent Republicans In this
city show that there is an under
current antagonistic to Daniel M.
Burns as United States Senator.
â¢ Mayor Fred Eatonâ Well, I don't know
what to say. Regarding the call, I favor
it, but as far as Colonel Burns is con
cerned he may or may not have a cinch.
At this time I can't say regarding the
wisdom shown by the Governor in calling
the extra session. If a good man is elected
it will be all right, and If, on the contrary,
a man is sent to the Senate who is not the
people's choice it will be a decidedly bad
thing for the party and the State. I have
my own troubles as Mayor and am not
dabbling in State politics.
Ex-Congressman James McLachlanâ l
am building up my law practice and am
not in politics. If the Jamaica treaty
passes, however, we will be sorry that we

Outside of this I have nothing to say. .
Judge Robert A. Ling, Police Commis
sionerâlf an extra session of the Legis
lature could have been called to elect
some one of the prominent Republicans
of the State to the United States Senate
I think it would be all right. But to call
one and elect such a man as Dan Burns
I not only consider the worst thing that
could happen to the Republican party, but
think that it will disrupt it in the State
and allow our opponents to wipe us from
off the earth at the next election. You
can't put It too strong for me.
Judge E. J. Ensignâ l approve of an ex
tra session and think Burns is going to be
elected. Furthermore, I think he ought to
be.
Cornelius Pendleton, ex- Assemblyman â
Oh, don't ask me! Of course I favor an
extra session; but whether Burns is the
right fellow or not remains to be seen.
If elected we will have to take our medi

tor, but as a Republican I believe that it
would be better for the party to- leave
the seat vacant than to till it with Burns.
The State needs a Senator, but with the
present feeling of the people, the party
cannot carry Burns.
L. A. Wrigh iâ Governor Gage's sixteen
reasons for calling an extra session are
all contained in one proposition â he is
paying Burns the political debt he owes
for his nomination and election. All other
reasons are mere subterfuges. Unless
Burns and Gage have overestimated their
influence at the extra session, the next
Republican campaign in California, so
far as State issues are concerned, will be
one of penitent apology for a faithless
Governor and an unworthy Senator.
W. W. Stewartâ Tne extra session is a
wise move, and should have been called
before. California needs two Senators
at Washington as much as any State in
the Union, for there are large interests
to be looked after. I am not one who be
lieves that the Republican party will be
disrupted by the election of Burns.
S. Leviâ My belief is that the State
should have two representatives at
Washington, and I think that the RepuD
lican party would be called more severely
to account if the seat were left vacant
than It will be if Burns is elected.

the following will show:
Godfrey Rueger, County Committee

election of Mr. Burns as Senator, but
desire very much that one be elected.
Simon Johnston, merchantâ l favor the

VALLEJO, Jan. 26.â Many of the

extra session is divided.
Senator Luchsingerâ l think the extra
session is all right. It is highly important
that the State should have a full repre
sentation in the upper house, and I believe
the choice should be made by the present
Legislature, which would insure a Repub

from the next election. I believe if the
matter were left in statu quo that the
candidacy of Dan Burns may jeopardize

OAKLAND. Jan. 26.â Arthur W. Feid
ler, Alameda County Treasurer
and one of the stanchest Repub-
Means of Livermore Valleyâ l do
not thlr.k that this was the proper time
for Governor Gape to have called an ex
tra session of the State Legislature. If
!t can be proved that the scheme in it

Mayor â I think the special session very

There was no need of it.
F. H. Atwaterâ l don"t think that the
exigencies of the case required a special

whom he names will be.
Supervisor T. C. Putnamâ l think that
the special session is against the interest
of the State. It may not be, but I fear it
on account of the Burns proposition.
Lyman Green. City Recorderâ There la
no occasion for the special session, which
will cause the State unnecessary great ex
pense. If it would result in tne election
of Barnes instead of Burns the evil would
be mitigated.
M. D. Hopkins. Assessor â The special
session will be useless and expensive and
in the end detrimental to the welfare of
the State.
George M. Brushâ l do not think that it
will prove productive of any benefit to
this State.
A. Kahn â I think the whole thing un

Thomas McGulreâ l think there is a big

M. Newburgerâ l do not think the occa

J. W. Caldwell. lawyer, says that it
looks as If the sole purpose of the cnll
was to elect Burns, and if that is so \t
would be a godsend if something wouM
happen to prevent the meeting.
Â«, Xa Keagle say 3 that it was not wise
to issue the call.
Postmaster George Folger did not wish
to express an opinion as to the call, but
said he was first, last and all the time for
Scott for Senator.
Richard Webb, capitalist, says he was
decidedly opposed to the call; that the Re
publican members when in regular session
should have gone into caucus and bLded
the result like men.
Senator John F. Davis, who supported
Scott in the regular session, has all along
been opposed to the extra session. He
contends that if there is any extraor
dinary emergency requiring: the calling of
the Legislature in extra session such
emergency was created by Governor
Gage; that the Legislature in regular ses
sion passed all needed legislation, but
many good bills, for the passage of which
there is now a demand, were by him
tossed into the waste basket.
D. H. BRYANT, San Jose â The methods of Burns are not in keeping with the
principles of the Republican party. His defalcation as Secretary of State and his record in
Mexico will disrupt the party and bring disgrace to the State.
GEORGE LYON, Lakeport â The conduct of -Burns while Secretary of State
should forever debar him from favorable indorsement by the people of California.
A. H. DEPUTY, Lakeport â Burns' name is bad. Always to beat his fellow
man is his record, and he would follow his bent toward the people of California if elected.
WILLIAM APPLETON, Lakeport â To elect such a man United States Sena
tor would be an outrage on the decent-minded people of California.
REV. W . L. GASTON, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Santa Rosa â I am free
to admit that the only reason I can see for this special session is a background in which
Burns looms up an uncanny aspirant for the Senatorship. The people do not want him on
moral grounds. Brigham Roberts is to be preferred.
F. W. GEORGESON, cashier Humboldt County Bank, Eureka â The selection of
Burns would be suicidal. McKinley is as popular as any living man, but the State would go
against him if Dan* Burns is sent to the Senate.
E. M. PYLE, chairman County Committee, Santa Barbara â The election of Burns
to the United States Senate would be a disgrace to civilization and the defeat of the Repub
lican party in this State for years.
J. J. SQUIRE, Deputy District Attorney, Santa Barbaraâ Dan Burns is not a proper
person for the position of United States Senator.
GEORGE A. BLACK, Santa Barbara â Dan Burns is not the man we want to send
to Washington as a specimen of Californians. No one could be a worse man.
D. GOCHENAUER, San Diego â It would be better for the party to leave the seat va
cant for a year than to fill it with Burns. The party cannot carry Burns.
L. A. WRIGHT, San Diego â Unless Burns and Gage have overestimated their in
fluence at the extra session, the next Republican campaign in California, so far as State is
sues are concerned, will be one of penitent apology for a faithless Governor and an unwor
thy Senator.
FRANK EGAN, County Committeeman, Angels Camp â I am unalterably opposed to
the election of Burns and do not believe that Gage should, be allowed to pay his political ob
ligations in this manner.
JOHN DAVEY, proprietor White House, Angels Camp â If Gage and Burns were- in
hades the people would be better off. The extra session is a scheme and a disgrace.
ALPHONSO BARRY, attorney, Angels Camp â If Gage's scheme carries and Dan
Burns is elected to the Senate of the United States it will be a standing and burning dis
grace to the State. This State needs a Senator badly, but it would be better off without one
than to send a man like Burns to represent it.
W. J. DOHERTY, Bakersfield â Down any scheme to elect Burns. It is a sorry day
for California if we can't elect a fit man for Senator.
ARTHUR W. FEIDLER, Alameda County Treasurer, Oakland â If it can be proved
that the scheme is to secure the election of Dan Burns it would be one of the most gigantic
conspiracies in the history of California.
D. S. BLACKBURN, capitalist, Ventura â The election of Burns would be a great
outrage on the people of this. State. Gage has. made a monstrous ass of himself.
F. S. COOK, ex-Town Marshal, Ventura â Burns should not force himself upon the
people when he surely knows he is not their choice.
A. J. PILLSBURY, Tulare â If the head of the San Francisco push is chosen Sena
tor the result will constitute a disaster to the Republican party and a humiliation to Cali
fornia.

for the purpose of making Dan Burns
Senator, and I do not think that the peo
ple want Dan Burns for Senator. Under
those circumstances, 1 do not think that
the extra session will be of any use to
any one except Dan Burns, and the ReÂ»

Frank Dominguez, Judge J. W. McKin

one way or the other.
STOCKTON, Jan. 26. â Republicans
expressed themselves as follows on
the Senatorial situation to-day:
Dr. George S. Harkness, chairman
of the County Central Committeeâ lf
Daniel Burns can secure the caucus nom
ination I am In favor of his election by
the Republican members, who stand
charged with the duty of filling the va
cancy now existing in the United States
Senate. Why this opposition to a cau
cus? Party nominees are always elected
in caucus.
E. C. Dickinson, Councilmanâ l favor
Scott and would under existinr condi
tions oppose a caucus.
George W. Langridge, chairman coun
ty executive committeeâ l favor & cau
cus. I favor the unit rule when a nom
ination is made. If it be Burns, all right.
W. C. Whiteâ l favor Scott and am un
alterably opposed to Burns.
Captain W. B. Hardacre â Anybody but
Burns, and the friends of the other can
didate should not go into caucus.
Theodore Brownâ Burns first, last and
all the time.
Judge C. P. Rendonâ Burns has been
good enough to make other people's fights
â has put up time and money for Republi
can success. I am free to say he Is my
favorite.
E. C. Wright, Superintendent of Schools
âScott is my man, although I have no
prejudices against any other candidate.
Julius Cohnâ l favor a caucus and I fa
vor Burns.
The above represent all elements in the
party and Is a fair consensus.

SANTA CRUZ.
SANTA CRUZ. Jan. 26.â Nearly every
prominent Republican who was in

the prevailing sentiment of leaders
of the party Is against the holding of the
extra session and think it unnecessary.
The refusal to commit themselves in

From what was gleaned from leaders It
Is an assured fact that neither Assembly

W. H. Lamb, Mayor of the city of San

FRESNO.
FRESNO, Jan. 26.â Fulton G. Berryâ
You'll quote me verbatim, will you?
. . Well, its the imposition I
ever heard of. I don't see any ex
cuse for saddling the expense of an extra
session upon the people of the State at
this time. We have expense enough to
bear without spending thousands of dol
lars for the luxury of electing a Senator,
especially when the Senator may not be
such a luxury after all. I think the ac
tion of Governor Gage was very unwise.
S. C. St. Johnâ l think Governor Gage
made a serious mistake in calling the ex
tra session of the Legislature. So far as
he Is concerned, it will injure him more
than any other of his indiscreet acts, and
what is more. It will cripple the party in
this State. An extra session never bene
fited the Governor who called it nor his
party, and this one will not benefit Gage.
So far as the question of a Senator is con
cerned, I will say that if I were a member
of the Legislature Burns would never get
my vote. The Legislature that elects him
will disgrace itself and the State. I don't
think Burns will be elected.

One military writer *unm up the catfs*
of the rrverrt an follows:
"Warren's mishap In far more due to
our continual *yÂ»tematic and apparently
intentional neglect in time of peace of the
simplest and moist obvious precautions
which affect our efficiency in war than
to any want of caution or military ca
pacity on the part of the general him
self."
This statement seems to be amply sup
ported by the publication last evening of
General Buller's official report on the bat
tles of Colenso, Gras Pan, Modder River
and others. Sir Redvers states plainly
that at Colenso Colonel Long took the
two batteries which were lost, far in ad
vance of the position he ordered him to
take without trying to ascertain whether
the Boers wore in front of him, and prac-
losses which would indicate serious fight
ing. Could it be that it was these battal
ions which were all day on Spion Kop?
If so, Lyttelton's brigade is counted as
part of Warren's force; if not, then the
fighting on Wednesday was serious, not
only at Splon Kop, but In front of Pot
gleters Drift also. The Boers appear to
have no lack of men, for It turns out that
the affair of Tuesday at Chieveley was
not a British but a Boer reconnolÃgance.
The Boer efforts against Ladysmith have
also increased. A difficult side of the sit
uation 1h the fact that the Boers in front
of Warren are aa near the British line
of retrtat, either at Chieveley or Est
court, as the British troops opposing
thf-m. and the Boers can move faster.
That is why Buller must win the battle."

The central picture, made from a British War Office map, gives a Mrdseye view of the Tugela River country from
ZwarU Kop, where General Buller's center rests, to Splon Kop, on the west, where his left wing under General Warren
has been maneuvering and fighting for a week or more. On the north of the Tugela and east of Venters Bprult, which
empties into it about half way betwÂ«Â«n Potgleters and Trichords drifts, is shown the "Dividing Ridge" between the
Blaauwbar.k Benin and the Tugela. This ridge begins on the Tugela near Colenso and runs to the west and north
west, rising as It goea until it merges in the Drakensberg Mountain*, between Tintwa and Van Rununs passes. From
Venters fipruit <-a*t to Colenso it throws its Kharp, steep spars down to the Tugeia, making its passage for horses and
wagons impracticable under any circumstances, except at one or two places. At one of the**, Potgieters Drift, the first
road went of Colenso CTOMes. Here General Buller made his appearance some two weeks ago, only to find the Boers in
pbsMMfOfl on the ridge and npurs on the other side, and bo commanding the drift aa to render his passage next to im
j>o*s!ble. Illn l*ft, under General Warren, co/itlnued west, and crossing the river eight miles above at Trichards Drift
found the Boers on the ridge* of the Tabamyama Mountain, which culminates on the eaÂ»t in Spion Kop. Four days*
fighting, with hÂ«-avy loss, put General Warren In possession of Splon Kop on Tuesday night, only to abandon It on
W*dneÂ»4ay night and retire to his present position near Trichards Drift. The steep hills rising continually to the west
toward the Drakeni-berg make any further movement by the left flank futile in the face of a watchful and active foe,
*r>d it **ems that another assault in front is General Warren's only hope of forcing a passage to Venters Spruit. And
even when this Is done he will only find himself before the main line of Boer defense along the crest of the steep-sloped
divide. Whether Warren on the west or Buller at Potgieters or both at once make the effort to brÂ«ak through the op
posing line, the undertaking will be a most arduous one and great loss of life must be incurred. It is to be remarked here
that the Boem advancing from the Drakensberg toward Ladysmith on the 20th of October had their first encounter with
General White's cavalry at Acton Homes. From Bpion Kop to Ladysmlth is thirty miles in a direct line.

"ANOTHER STEP INTO
THE MOUSE TRAP"
BERLIN. Jan. 26â The latest new* from
South Africa is interpreted as a ?ignal
defeat for the British. The Deutsche
Tageblatt calls the British position there
"another fctep into the mouse trap."*
The last direct German malls to the
Transvaal are now being returned from
Cape Town without any explanation on
the part of the British authorities. The
German press comments upon the fact
with considerable heat.
An Incident illustrating the bitterness of
popular feeling in Germany against Lng
land ia the appearance of a pamphlet to
day entitled. "The Final Reckoning W ith
England." This pretends to describe
events in 1531 and sets forth descriptions
of naval battles in which Germany de
feats England and a general breakup of
the British empire ensues, with Australia
declaring her independence and the other
British colonies being divided up among
various powers.

TALKS TO YEOMANRY
LONDON. Jan. 26.â At the Life Guards'
barracks at Regent Park this morning
the Prince of Wales Inspected the first lot
of Yeomanry, who start for South Africa
to-morrow. A number of well-known
people wÂ»re present, including Lady
Essex, Lord Rothschild and Lord and
Lady Lonsdale. The Prince of Wales,
who wore the undress uniform of a staff
general, walked along the' entire line with
Lord Chesham, making the most minute
Inspection of every man, often taking a
rifle in his hands and examining all parta
of the equipment. The men looked very
buHlnesÃ-like in khaki and puttees, with
cowboy hats turned up at the side, with
a little bronze emblem representing the
Prince of Wales feathers. At the con
clusion of the Inspection the Prince of
Wales made a speech, during which ho
said;

BURNHAM REARRESTED.
Wife Now Brings a Charge of As
sault Against Hira.
Special Dispatcn to me can.
PASADENA, Jan. 26.â Not content when
the Superior Court adjudged her husband
sane. Mrs. D. R. Burnham to-day had him
arrested and charged with assattlt. The
Burnham case haa been the most sensa
tional which has occurred in this city for
a long time, on account of the high social
standing of the parties. Though the ar
rest of Captain Bumham to-day was not
unlooked for by some of his friends, it
has caused a revival of Interest In the
case.
Captain Burnham Is a retired army oS
cer and his son Is Captain William Burn
ham of Morro Castle. Havana. Mrs.
Burnham. who brings the accusations
against her husband and follows them up
so unrelentingly, is the granddaughter of
an English nobleman and a relative of
President Buchanan. Ehe has been mar
ried to Captain Burnham for forty-one
years. Very few people believed that the
charges were true, and they were not sub
stantiated when Captain Burnham was
acquitted In short order of the insanity
charge. A strange feature of this case Is
that young Burnham, the son, has been
111. He got out of bed to appear in court
and stood by his father, telling his mother
when she upbraided him that he had to
tell the truth.

SAN JOSE. Jan. 2(s.â Abram Kin*, the
aged capitalist, who was accused of for
gery in connection with his guardianship
of Stephen Hobson, an insane person. wa<Â»
acquitted of one of the six charges by the
Jury this afternoon. The charge on which
King was tried was raining the claim cf
John AntheÂ» for paperhanging from tlo 90
to $25 90. King claimed he had expemit.l
the additional $10 for the estate, and mrre

Two years ago the Grand Jury returned
blx indictments for forgery and one for
perjury against King. On the previous
trial for forgery the jury disagreed.
King is one of the most prominent enri
tallsts in the county. He has been a bank

other public offices. When Stephen Hob

**The conssquencefi of this latest check may be
very serious to the gallant Ladysmith garrison. It

be that General Buller will be compelled to retire from

sure that the British people will not 6how themselves

would be well advised to call out immediately all the
militia and to expedite the dispatch of the Eighth
Division and of the Fourth Cavalry Brigade, No doubt
Lord Roberts will strain nerve to enable General
Buller to renew the attempt to relieve Ladysmith."

I one time and place, and on all sides could
be heard in the hum of conversation re
marks to the effect that they who had
given up the sport for the last year or
so were going to take it up with renewed
energy this spring. Many dealers were
present, and they all asserted that there
was an unprecedented demand for new
wheels and the repair of old ones.
On Wednesday night all this was doubly
proven by the attendance at the meeting
of the association, which has been unable
to get a quorum for the past four months,
but had enough delegates present that
night to make two meetings. Many
thought this would be its last meeting,
but a motion to adjourn sine die was
voted down unanimously. Amendments
! to the by-laws were proposed, changing
somewhat the general scope of the or-
I ganlzation, and from the enthusiastic
speeches of Mr. Woodson of Sacramento
and Mr. Adams of this city it was ap
parent that the association was about to
awaken from its lethargy and continue
in its control of cycling. The only thing
that the body will give up Is the control
of track racing, that being delegated to
the National Cycling Association, as suc
cessor of the League of American Wheel
men.
The entertainment committee of the
California Cycling Club has arranged for
the club's monthly social, to be held at
the club rooms. Twenty-second and Fol

genbach is figuring on a run to Tocaloma

The East Side Cycling Club of Los An

Leon Conklin. president; E. Sullivan, vice
president; Walter Leeds, secretary-treas
urer; W. 11. McKeog. captain; R. D. Mus

ond lieutenant: these, with J. Johnson. E.
C. Dockstadter and i rands Frankhouser,
form the board of directors.
Herbert V. Ready of the Bay City Club
Is touring Southern California for his
health.
The Capital City Wheelmen of Sacra
mento have again elected J. A. Woodson
president. He has managed the club most
successfully In the past, and Is highly de
serving of the honor. So much Is Mr.
Woodson's ability appreciated by cyclists
at large that he was recently offered the
presidency of the C. A. C. C, but would
not accept, saying he thought the presi
dent of that body should reside In this
city. The other officers elected by the
Capital Cityd are: Dr. Clifford Todd. vice

G. S. Eldred, historian: George Stroner,

RIFLEMEN'S NEW CLUB.
San Jose has a new rifle-shooting club

clubs of this kind in the Garden City.
L. D. Hoback was the leader in the move
ment, creating the latest, which differs
materially in its make-up from all others
in the State. The difference lies in that
Its membership is limited to ten, and nine

CYCLISTS SHOW ACTIVITY.
Two occurrences within the past week
have caused local wheelmen to open their
eyes to the fact that what was thought
to be apathy toward the sport was mere
ly rest, and that the season of 1900 prom
ises to be a revival of the boom of ISSS.
The first of these was the immense crowd
of old-time wheelmen at the Bay City
Club's entertainment last Saturday night.
Never in the history of the sport have
so many prominent riders gathered at
INDOOR BASEBALL.
Indoor baseball and basket-ball are
causing the athletes of the Young Men's
Christian Association considerable men
tal trouble at the present time. The con
flict in the two schedules has forced the
basket-ball men to the wall and has
caused a postponement of basket-brill
games.
The reason of the postponement is due
to the fact that many of the basket-ball
men are playing on the Indoor baseball
team. The schedule for this league, which
will comprise the Olympic, Reliance and
Young Men's Christian Association teams,
was settled last night. The first game
will be played next week and the, last some
time in the middle of February; The win
ner of this league will meet Stockton for
the State championship and the prize cup.
The basket-ball league of Oakland, com
prising five teamsâ Athens, Spartans, Mis
sions, Rusers and Apollosâ will recom
mence operations In April. A new basket
ball team has been organized under the
name of the Alerts: C. W. McConncll,
right guard; A. E. Blethner. left guard;
W. S. Graves, center; A. E. Larsen. right
forward; Alex Petersen (captain), left
forward; substitutes, Irvine Holmes and
William Dryer.
C. E. Pomeroy has been made manager
of the indoor baseball team.
AROUNDTHE BOATHOUSES
The five-mile barge race on Oakland
Creek last Sunday between the Alameda
seniors and a crew of the South End
Rowing Club was won easily by the for
mer, who jumped away with the lead and
were never caught. Though Ayers' wrists
became cramped and Greenleaf was row-
Ing extremely short during the latter part
of the race, the South Enders were quite
unable to gain on their rivals, two of
their own men having given out. The
Alamedas rowed about 40 strokes a min
ute all through, and at the finish quick
ened to 42 or 43. This is a fast stroke
for a long course, but the Alameda sen
iors form a clever crew and can sit their
boat, which cannot be said of the South
End representatives. The event served
to show that the Oakland Creek is an
eminently suitable course.
Walter Dupllssea. T. Lynch. John Mit
chell and "Tom" Lynch, who were In the
Third Artillery, have returned from Ma
nila and will take up rov.ing again.
At the last meeting of the South End
Rowing Club the officers elected for the
present half year were Installed and the
following new members were initiated:
J. Magulre, Victor Elfendahl, W. J. De
martini and John HaTineti. At the next
meeting L. Walsh and M. Kilgallon will
be initiated.
The membership list of the Aerial Row
ing Club is growing and, as there is no
limitation to the number of members, the
club bids fair to pass the others. Sev
eral applications for membership are on
file, and at a recent meeting six new
members were initiatedâ E. J. Murphy of
the Southern Pacific law department
John H. Desmond and Aaron H. Brown
of the Southern Pacific freight office, Wal
ter H. Young of the Sun Insurance of
fice and Charles J. McKeon. Robert El
lis, who left this city for Manila several
months ago. has returned and rejoined
the Arlels. The club will have three barge
crews the coming season. The seniors
will be: H. Wilson; bow; W. McKenr.a.

NO STEELHEADS TAKEN.
The sportsmen who went to the Russian
River district last Saturday after steel
heads returned without a single fish. As
such Fklllful anglers as John Siebe, George
Watson, Fred Johnson. Judge Evans,
John Butler. Colonel Kelihor. A. T. Vo
gelsang and Al Wilson were in the party
it was through no lack of ability that they
were unable to show tome evidence of
their fishing expedition.
The stream was clear at Austins and
also below that point. The fish were not
bar-bound and could go up If they so de
sired. It is the opinion of expert fisher
men that there will be little sport this sea
son, the river being so high. This will be
favorable to the fish, which suffered se
verely for the past two years.
John Gallagher secured some fine young
steelheads on Thursday at Point Reyes.
He sent a platterful to John Butler.

ball and General Athletic
Work Interests the Students.
SPRING athletics are already interest
ing the college men. though the sea
son Is winter. Baseball and other
Fport* have supplanted football. The pre
liminary work has begun and before many
Â¦weeks elapse the San Francisco public
Â¦will have an opportunity of witnessing
the Blue and Gold and the Cardinal pitted
ngainst each other on diamond and cin
der-path.
Dr. Murphy, who had charge of the
football team at Stanford last year, will
train and coarh the baseball and track
teams. As a baseball coach Murphy has
a splendid reputation. He has played at
Yale and also coached there after his
craduation. With the material he has to
work on at Palo Alto a strong nine should
be developed. So far the material offered
him consists of Havens. Murphy. Knapp,
liraden, Dutton. Phillips. Traeger, Horn,
Loughead, Edwards, Symonds, Cowden,
Lanni^an and Captain Strohn. In this
group are many veterans, and the new
mon are also promising candidates.
Class games have been in progress at
Berkeley during the past week, and they
have disclosed some good material, though
nothing of the extraordinary kind. Next
week the college team will begin its work
end then Captain Kaarsberg will have his
hands full until the end of spring. The
promising candidates are: McKeown.
Warren. Smith, Wolf. Kaarsberg. Carl,
Jones. Barker. Carter. Hunter. Hamlin
and Mem. Swan and Fuller may return
On the track California will have a team
that may possibly outclass anything ever
developed on this coast. Under Track
Captain Drum the preliminary gymnasium
work has begun and the men will go on
the field shortly. There are as candidates
for the team: Drum. Woolsey. Bakewell.
Squires, Moser. Carpenter. Gustafson.
Powell. Hoffman, Walsh. De Lashmutt.
Allen. Broughton. Hussey and a number
of freshmen. , .
Stanford will not neglect track and field
athletics. Track Captain Hugh Boyd has
already marshaled his men. and they are
by no means light, either in number or in
quality. This is Stanford's list of athletes

AMONG THE YACHTSMEN.
Last Sunday Commodore T. L. Hill of
the San Francisco Yacht Club visited
Larkspur and spent some time on board
his sloop Cygnus, which is laid up in the
creek there. Several Corinthians were at
Tiburon overhauling their craft, scraping
booms and spars. The annual meeting of
the Corinthian Yacht Club will be held
on Wednesday evening, the 31st inst..
when the nominees on the regular ticket
will be elected as officers for the present
year. Preparations for the entertainment
to be given in Native Sons' Hall on the
evening of February 15 are progressing,
a rehearsal having been held a few even
ings ago. Tickets have been distributed
among the members for sale to their
friends and to those who have witnessed
tTie shows given and partaken of the hos
pitality dispensed by the club at Tiburon.
The lagoon behind i.^uron is generally
considered a pretty safe wintering place
for a boat, but even there a yacht occa
sionally drags her moorings. In the re
cent storm the schooner Gladys ran upon
the mud flats, near the railroad, and her
owners had considerable trouble in float
ing her again.

The California Yacht Club members are
looking forward to an active season. The
old wharf being weak, it is intended to
build a new and larger one, reaching far
ther out into the creek; also to improve
the trestle walk leading to the clubhouse
on the side toward Alameda. The trophy
offered last season by Commodore A. M.
Clay to the yacht attending the largest
number of cruises was won by E. N. Wal

DUCKS AVOID
PRESERVES OF
THE GUN MEN
While the Bay Is Full of Splen
did Birds, Sportsmen Report
a Scarcity on the Regular
Shooting Grounds.
THE sportsmen who went in quest of
ducks last Sunday had but little sport
to repay them for their efforts, as
there was no flight of birds. There was
no wind stirring on the marshes and few
birds were seen on any of the preserves.
The bays in this vicinity were covered
with canvasbacks. bluebills and butter
balls, but they would not permit boats
of any description to approach them. The
conditions remain the same this week,
and unless a storm develops, the results
should be tho same.
Al Cumming has lost his famous Irish
setter Sport, which has been his insepar
able companion for fifteen years on his
innumerable fishing and shooting excur
sions. The dog was poisoned at Salmon
Creek, where his owner was enjoying a
brief outing. It is thought some of tho
fishermen, who were using illegal meth
ods, took offense at the presence of Mr.
Cumming, who is a deputy Fish Commis
sioner, and is widely known as one of the
most thorough sportsmen on the coast.
For five years past he has not used a
landing net for trout, salmon or steelhead,
the dog retrieving the fish as he would a
quail or a snipe. Mr. Cumming has in
stituted an inquiry in an effort to.fix the
responsibility for the death of his dog.
Shooting on the Olympic Club preserve
last Sunday was of average quality. \V .
A. Marshall was "high gun" with eight
een birds. A great number of canvas
backs were seen in the vicinity, but were
difficult to get. H. J. Wicker and H. B.
Hosmer spent Wednesday at the preserve,
but there were no ducks to be found.
Bert Patrick shot over a private pre
serve near Reeds Station, Marin County,
last Sunday and killed fifteen "cans,"
five widgeon and two teal. He will try
his fortune at the same place to-day.
L. R. Larzalere, John H. Burfeind and
a friend secured a joint bai? of thirty
birds on the Spooney Gun Club preserve
last week. For some weeks previous they
averaged about a hundred birds each day.
They shot over their Alvarado preserve.
11. E. Rose, W. Ray and Louis Titus
went up the bay to Point Richmond last
Sunday in a launch. They secured forty
five birds, the majority of them "cans."
James G. Chesley and E. W. Briggs
made a similar pilgrimage through Rich
ardson's Bay, getting ten "cans" and ten
bluebills.
J. Homer Fritch and W. D. McCarthy
shot over the preserve of Petaluma
Sportsmen's Club last Sunday and secur
ed two and a half dozen ducks. Mr. Mc-
Carthy contributed the lion's share of the
bag.
J. K. Orr, the veteran field and trap
shot, was out after quail during the past
week.
Drakes Bay, above Point Reyes, is said
to provide great shooting, but the accom
modations for strangers are limited. A
Mr. Howard, of Sacramento secured sixty
ducks in one day's shooting recently.
Captain James Markland is preparing
for a descent upon the ducks and will
close the season in brilliant style.
Al Aull secured some plump ducks near
V.allejo on Thursday.
"The board of governors of the Califor
nia Inanimate Target Association will
meet Monday night in the rooms of the
Olympic Gun Club. Secretary Ad Gunzen
dorfer announces that preliminary ar
rangements will be made for the eighth
annual State tournament, which will be
held at Fresno on April 29 and 30.
MAKES AN ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO ENGLAND TO HUNT WITH FOX HOUNDS.
IT is no uncommon story to hear of well-to-do Englishmen going: far afield in quest of big game shooting. It Is unusual,
on the contrary, to hear of Calif ornians making regular pilgrimages to England to enjoy the delights of riding to
hounds. Henry Wormington, an Englishman by birth, but a Californian by adoption, is among the latter class of
sportsmen. It has been his custom for years, when business interests permit, to visit England and settle down in the
Worcestershire country, where he can hunt six days a week if he so desires. Three packs, the Worcestershire, the Croome
and the Ledbury, are all available. Mr. Wormington keeps his favorite huntress in England and when he leaves for this
country places her in safe hands and disperses the remainder of his stable. He is enthusiastic over the manner in which
the sport is maintained in England. A large number of packs are supported and many of them attract fields of from
100 to* 200 men and women. The men invariably sport the scarlet coat and take the fences as they find them, riding as
hard as the hunting men of old.
on February 1. Mr. Cranston is a thor
ough sportsman and is particularly well
informed on the subject of greyhounds.
Sir. Parkinson has had charge of the con
ditioning of the dogs for some time past
and has met with marked success. How
well he did his work is attested by the
consistent running of the dogs and the
excellent showing they have made. The
kennel will be represented in the John

these will be his promising dog Master

J. P. Thrift's fine collection of puppies

hope they will survive the attack, as they
are a promising lot of youngsters.
T. J. Cronin is being congratulated on
the showing made by his new purchase,

secured from M. C. Delano. They divided
the sapling stake at Union Park last Sun

FOR FREEDOM WILL BE

Â£"^ Rosseter's greyhound For Freedom,
the most sensational performer on the
coursing field, will be seen in competition
to-morrow at Union Coursing Park. After
the noon recess he will be given a public
trial with some good dog. It was intended
to use Mr. Rosseter's Recording Angel for
the trial, but she was entered in the puppy
stake, where she will be tested severely in
meeting the best young dogs on the coast.
The outcome of both trials will be a mat

THE SESSION AND THE SCHEMERS
rOR the purpose of showing the tone of Repub
lican sentiment concerning the extra session of
the Legislature and the Senatorial aspirations of
Barns, The Call has made an elaborate canvass of
leading Republicans of all parts of California, and
publishes their stateir.ents this morning. There are
some who express approval of the session provided
jJv.rns be not elected to the Senate; there are a few
who iavor the session and the candidacy of Burns; but
the overwhelming majority declares the session to be
nothing more than a scheme to elect Burns, declares
I cms to be untit for the place, and denounces the
u'.ioie conspiracy as an outrage upon the taxpayers,
a farce and a fraud, tending to the injury of the State
<v.j the ruin of Republican prospects in the coming
campaign.
Sonic of the Â£re::t!emen interviewed regard the
trickery of the Governor and the railroad as an evi
dence of a certain kind of cleverness, but such are not
r."merous. The shrewd common sense of most per
c ive in the call for an extra session made under such
circumstances a political blunder of the worst kind.
One speaker says the Governor is an idiot: another
declares frankly that he has made an ass of himself.
The-e people are aware that popular sentiment against
I) urns is so strong that it will be an act of besotted
folly on the part of any legislator to vote for him â
an act virtually amounting :o political suicide.
It will be noted there are two points on which al
irost all agree. The first is that the election of Burns
v. 11l be a disgrace to California, and the second is that
it uill well nigh ruin the chances of the Republican
p^rty in this State for years to come. Not a few
Eiacch a::d stalwart Republicans declare they would
rather have no Senator at all than to see the grand
old party subordinated to the service of Burns and
the railroad, while others equally loyal to the best tra
ditions and principles of Republicanism declare they
mould prefer a Democrat to Burns, who is neither
Republican r.or Democrat, but simply a rascally tool
of the Southern Pacific Company.
Such arc the views wkich eminent Republicans in
all ;rirti of the State take of the session and of the
sc!;c::iers who have brought it about. Republican
members of the Legislature will do well to give good
heed to viic views of such men, for they represent the
sentiment of the party as a whole, and with that sen
tinieiit all Republican candidates will have to deal i<:
the corning campaign.
It is not worth while to consider whether the
SCbcVae be ihe trick of cunning knaves or the blunder
of biind fools. It suffices that it is something which
has :.'.ade the enemies of the Republican party rejoice,
ar.il roused the indignation of. Republicans them
5*] vet The taxpayers have not failed to note that
the :rick involves a large expenditure of public
ojorry, and. whether Republicans. Democrats or
Popv.lists, they are r.ot pleased that they have to pay
so It rpe a price 1:1 order to enable the Governor to
"do politics" and repay to Burns and the Southern
Pacific Company thr debt he owes them.
That is the clear meaning of the interviews we pub
lish this morning. The issue is in the hands of the
Republican members of the Legislature. They cannot
redeem the lost honor of Gage, but they can save the
Republican party from the dishonor he would put
upon Â«t. By promptly finishing the business for
which it I'.r.s been called, and by electing an honor
able man to the United States Senate, they can re
lirve the party from the menace that threatens it.
The responsibility is upon them and there is no way
to shirk it.
np HE discovery of one of the buoys be-
I longing to the Andrea expedition has
I been noted by the daily press. Twelve
-*â¢ of these buoys were taJcen with the
expedition, each one consisting of a cork
balloon painted with the Swedish co!or3
(yellow and blue) and covered with a net
work of strong copper wire ending below
in a spike.
In the upper end of the balloon there
was an opening in which was secured a
cylinder, that was closed at the lower end
by mean? of a rubber packing and at the
upper end screwed In the copper plate to
which the netting was secured. On the
plate the inscription, "Andree s Polar Ex
pedition. ISW. Nr. . . ."was l engraved.
The Inscription was dated 1596. the year
for which the expedition was first planned,
and was not altered, although Andree
really started in 1.-tfT. The Iron cylinder
wa.s "designed to carry communications in
writing. From the cylinder, whtch pro
jects beyond the plate, extends a strong
spiral iron wire that terminates In a
Swedish Ba* made of sheet -iron. TTM3
arrangement is very practical, for if tha
buoy i* thrown into the water It will al
ways fall with the copper spike down, and
If It falls on the ground or or. Ice the splice
will bore in so that the flag will always be
upi>#TTr.o3t. The buoy which was founa
Is 12.5 inches long, and has been declared
by several experts who met In Stockholm
oh October 1 to be the so-called north pole
huov, that ts>, the buoy Andree was to
have thrown out after the north pole had
been passed. ' ...
Nansen thinks that the finding of thl3
buoy Is a bad sicn and believes that the
evidence is that It was thrown out as bal
last rather than as a means of commu
nication. He thinks that the buoy was
I thrown out near Franz Josef Land.
THE BIG RAILWAY COMBINES.
AMONG the arguments advanced by the Inter
state Commerce Commission in support of
the recommendation that larger powers be
given to the commission in dealing with railway mat
ters is one drawn from the recent combinations
formed among the railway managers. On that sub
ject the report of the commission says: "It is a
matter of common knowledge that vast schemes of
railway control are now in process of consummation,
and that the competition of rival lines is to be re
strained by these combinations. While this move
ment has not yet found full expression in the actual
consolidation of railroad corporations, enough has
transpired to disclose a unification of financial inter
ests which will dominate the management and har
monize the operations of lines heretofore independent
and competitive. This is to-day the most noticeable
and important feature of the railway situation. If the
plans already foreshadowed are brought to effective
results, and others of similar scope are carried to
execution, there will be a vast centralization of rail
road properties, with all the power involved in such
far-reaching combinations, yet uncontrolled by any
public authority which can be efficiently exerted. The
restraints of competition upon excessive and unjust
rates will in this way be avoided, and whatever evils
may result will be remediless under existing laws."
It is pointed out that coincident with these schemes
of unified control the railways operating through an
extensive territory have recently made very large in
creases in their scale of charges. Numerous article*
have been taken from a class in which they were for
merly placed and put in a higher class. The advances
have been agreed upon by carriers without oppor
tunity for shippers, dealers or consumers to be hearu.
As a result there have been many complaints, and
under the law the complainers have a right to be
heard; but as the commission says: '"So long as
carriers are practically free to make and apply such
rates as they choose, and there is at the same time no
adequate provision for determining whether such
rates are just and reasonable, or for preventing the
exaction of those found unjust and unreasonable, al
though declared by statute to be unlawful, the injus
tice which may result must be without available re
dres?."
The statements of the report are almost matters of
common knowledge. Certainly the public under
stands that railways fix rates at their pleasure and
grant discriminations at pleasure, despite the law.
The report says: "The commission has made earnest
and persistent efforts to secure enforcement of the
penal provisions of the law. but. whatever may be the
reason for failure, the fact is that convictions have
been very few in comparison with the number of
prosecutions instituted."
That is the situation of the time. To defeat the
law and defy the nation the railway managers have or
ganized larger combinations than ever. Now, shall
the nation abandon the fight and surrender to the
corporations, or shall it meet the increased strength
of the corporations by increasing the power of the
commission sufficiently to enable it to enforce the law
and do justice?
COLONEL BRYAN AND THE FATHERS.
IX his pilgrimage in search of an office Colonel
Bryan recently reached Baltimore. The Demo
cratic Legislature had refused to invite him to in
struct it in its duties, and as this snub indicated that
I "My Maryland" was the enemy's country, the colonel
! rushed into it like the unthinking warhorse into battle.
To his Baltimore meeting the members of the regu
iar Democratic State Committee were bid in vain.
The office-holders elected by that party last year upon
a platform that omitted Bryan and his free silver and
its â¢"divinely appointed ratio," also put their willing
hands to the snub. But, unabashed and unappalled,
the colonel appeared in the Monumental City and
spoke 10 a mixed multitude. He put great stress and
strain upon the income tax, and we refer to that part
of his speech as fairly illustrative of his method. He
said: "In what proportion do people pay internal
revenue taxes? Why, largely in proportion to the
liquor and tobacco they use! And so far as you col
lict taxes from liquor and tobacco you make the poor
man pay more than the rich."
As the colonel is a specialist and expert in matters
affecting those whom he calls "the poor," we take it
that the result of his observations is given in that
sentence. But we submit that instead of being an
argument in politics it is a sermon in morals and
economics, and the conclusion is, if you want to get
rich go light on liquor and tobacco. But the able
colonel continues: "The Republican party looked
around for any old thing to put a revenue stamp on.
My friends, you heard men denounce our income tax
in 1896. I want to say it is stronger to-day than it
was then. And if those who have been shirking their
taxes think that they have settled this question for
ever. I want to tell them that the income tax will be
in the next campaign, and it will be in the campaign
until the Constitution of the United States is so
amended as to specifically authorize an income tax, so
that neither one Judge nor nine Judges can build
a bulwark around the fortunes of the great and throw
the burden^ of government on the poor."
The coruscating oratorical career of the colonel has
furnished but few better specimens of the Bryanic
method. He assaults the Supreme Court for build
ing "a bulwark around the fortunes of the great," and
then admits that the constitution will have to be
amended before that aforesaid bulwark can be torn
down! It appears, then, that the "bulwark" was built
by the constitution and not by the Judge?, and that
the colonel confesses thnt all his rant against the Re
publican iÂ«nrty for not enacting an income tax is an
accusation that it refuses to violate the constitution.
If the constitution has to be amended to permit such
tax, its imposition now would violate the constitu
tion.
Colonel Bryan's noble rage is misdirected. His ap
peal to prejudice is misapplied. The Republicans and
the courts are not to blame for the lack of an income
tax. That selfish old plutocrat and monopolist and
enemy of the poor. George Washington, who pre
sided over the convention that made the constitution,
cunningly planned to build a bulwark around the for
ti'.r.es of the great. In this criminal purpose he was
aided by James Madison. Alexander Hamilton and
the whole push, and abetted by JetTersoii and Mon
roe. It is well that these conspirators stand exposed
at last. Mr. Bryan has smoked them out of their
graves and has smudged their fame in history, and
proposes to amend their infamous handiwork out of
the constitution.
But what are '.ye to think of Colonel Bryan when,
immediately *fter proposing to amend into the con
stitution that protection of the poor which these
fathers of that instrument had left out, he took the
audience to the palpitating bosom of his confidence
and whispered into its shell-like ear his cherished am
bition, to this effect: "I want, it 1 can, to restore a
government founded upon the Declaration of Inde
pendence, and administered according to the doc
trines of Jcfierson; a government that will stand is
it did in Jackson's day, between a bank aristocracy
and the people. But, my friends. I cannot tell you
what fate has decreed. I cannot tell you whether it
is to be our lot to triumph, and in our triumph lay
the foundation again in the old places and raise again
the ancient landmarks which the fathers had set up."
What are we to do with this remarkable colonel,
who in the same speech spits upon the "old places"
and the "ancient landmarks" by declaring that he will
have to amend the foundation and move the land
marks because they build "a bulwark around the for
tunes of the great and impose all the burdens of gov
ernment upon the poor." and then asks for a triumph
that will enable him to lay the foundation in the same
old place and raise again the ancient landmarks fixed
by the same old fathers!
We fear the colonel is threatened with paresis, or
thinks that his hearers are paranoiacs.
Some of the worthy gentlemen who are handling
the Burns campaign might find it to advantage to
have the testimony in the case of United States Sena
tor Clark of Montana issued in pamphlet form. The
faithful might discover a trick or two which they did
not know. It appears that a vote for Senator in
Montana is worth any old thing.

THE INVASION OF INDIA.
BY way. perhaps, of distracting the attention of
the British from the war in the Transvaal and
relieving them from ;he strain of an over
amount of thought and emotion on that subject there
has been recently published in Russia by a military
writer, V. T. LcbcdyelT, a work entitled, "To Indin:
A Military, Statistical and Strategical Sketch; A
Plan of Future Invasion." The book has certainly
had the effect of drawing some attention at least, for
the London Chronicle has made it the subject of an
elaborate review.
The work must not be confounded ;yith the general
style of treatises on the invasion of India. It is not
designed lor popular reading, but for the study of
Russian officers. It is technical, and not literary. It
is. made up of complex calculations of the ways and
means and cost of transportation of armies and their
supplies, of intricate geographical and strategical de
tail?, and is intended to serve as a basis for a plan of
campaign in caÂ«e one should be undertaken.
Most works or magazine articles on the problem of
a Russian invasion of India are of little importance.
LebedycfTs treatise, however, appears to be well
worth attention. According to his view the conquest
of India i? now practicable by the Russians, but will
require a series of operations extending over long
periods of time. He divides his plan of advance into
four campaigns, after each of which he thinks Russia
would find herself in an impregnable position, and
could force England to make peace, while retaining
her conquests and holding her hands free to construct
new bases for a further advance. At the conclusion
of the third of the^e campaigns she would find herself
on the Indus with India at her mercy. The fourth
campaign, from the Indus eastward, M. Lebedyeff
thinks, would never need to be fought.
The first step in the forward movement would be
the capture of Herat, and Lebedyeft thinks it would
be better for Russia to risk a war with Great Britain
by seizing the fortress rather than to declare war in
the hope of taking it afterward. After fortifying that
position the next advance would be to Kandahar

A NATIONAL PARK AT TAHOE.
(-- ENATOR STEWART of Nevada has intro
\ duced a bill to set apart certain lands in Cali
*â fornia and Nevada as a public park and forest
reservation, to be known as Lake Tahoe National
Park. The bill provides that townships numbered
11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 16 of range 14 cast, and the simi
larly numbered townships of ranges 15 east. 16 cast,
17 east and 18 east, Mount Diablo meridian, shall be
withdrawn from occupancy or sale under the laws of
the United States and set apart as reserve forest lands
and dedicated as a public park and pleasure-ground
for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.
It is further provided that the surplus waters due
to the annual rainfall in the Lake Tahoe catchment
basin are to be reserved for irrigation purposes, and
the Secretary of the Interior is instructed to estab
lish such regulations with respect to the outflow of
water from the lake as shall best subserve that pur
pose. The United States Geological Survey is re
quired within one year from the passage of the act to
survey and prepare plans showing such tracts of land
as may be necessary for an impounding dam at the
source of the Truckee River, together with estimates
of the cost of constructing and maintaining it.
The passage of- the bill will secure to the people
another great park and add to the permanent attrac
tions of the mountains by preventing the destruction
of the natural beauties of that wonderful region. It
will also be another step toward the attainment of a
comprehensive system of forest protection and water
preservation, two objects of vast importance to every
portion of the country, but particularly so to the
West. Ample provisions are of course made in the
bill to compensate all persons whose property may
be taken from them for the purpose of establishing
the park. Thus there will be no injustice done to any
one, and the bill apparently merits the support of all
who take an intelligent interest in the preservation of
our natural parks, our waning forests and our sur
plus waters.

MARRIAGEâ Constant Reader. City.
If a man and woman agree to live to
gether as husband and wife without a
ceremony being performed according to
law, that Is construed to be a contract
marriage, for a contract may be either
verbal or written. Such a "marriage" is
not now recognized by the law in Cali
fornia. If the parties had so lived prior
to the repeal of the contract marriage
clause and each had acknowledged the
other by the title of husband and wife
such is a marriage to all intents and pur
poses.
A marriage with a minor .without the
consent of parents is voidable, yet In the
case cited in the letter of inquiry if the
parents were cognizant of the marriage
and entered no protest, but allowed the
couple to live together, a court might
construe that to be a tacit consent and
the minor so married could not legally de
sert the other and "be free and independ
ent of the marriage relations." But this
is a matter that would depend upon cir
cumstances and would require a judicial
interpretation.

DANCED UNDER
CROSSED SWORDS
Army and Navy Cotillon
off La Jeuraesse Club.
Each season boasts of one big dance
that establishes the social standing of all
who attend. The season IS9O-1900 will be
remembered by the army and navy co
tillon given last evening by the patron
esses of the La Jeunes.se Club. It was the
dance of the year and stands pre-eminent
in point of fashionable members, lavish
decoration and originality of conception.
La Jeunesse, heretofore, has danced at
Cotillon Hall, but the unusually * large
number of invitations ls>jÂ»uecl for laxt
night's affair found the Polk street hall
too small. Consequently, the patronesses
arranged that the dance be held at Golden
Gate Hall.
The fact that it was an army and navy
cotillon was made evident everywhere.
Flags and trl-colorfd bunting were used
with artistic effects in decorations, and
each of the ladies was gowned in the
national color of her choice.
Lieutenant John T. Haines and Lieuten
ant R. F. Gardner led the cotillon and In
troduced three charming figuresâ a sword
march, in which the ladies moved beneath
the crossed swords of the men: a flag fig
ure, in which the dancers moved around
an outspread flag, and an absolutely new
figure, called the cannon figure. A little
brass mortar mounted on the stage dis
charged a hail of beribboned brass but
tons at the dancers and the gentlemen
charged the canon's mouth to bring back
to their fair partners the favor projectiles.
After the cotillon a spondid supper was
served, after which dancing was resumed.
Those in the first set were Miss Cockrlll
and Fred Poett, Miss Clara Huntington
and Percy King. Miss Elizabeth Hunting
ton and Dupont Coleman. Miss Georglana

extended her railways to that point and. established a
strong base of supplies there. The third campaign
would carry Russia to the Indus, and India would
then be at her mercy.
It is curious that Lebedyeft does not advise the
actual conquest of India. He prefers to leave the
country in the hands of the British after Russia is in
a position to dominate it.
"With the extension of our dominions to the In
dus," he says, "we could prepare new bases for irrup
tion into India; in our hands would be a Damocles
sword, by means of which we could thwart all Eng
lish opposition in Europe, while England would be
compelled to increase her army and live in constant
dread of losing her Indian possessions. In all prob
ability this would lead to a close alliance with Great
Britain, with immense advantage to both powers.
The Eastern question would be settled in Russia's fa
vor, and Russia would have as her neighbors in India
not fanatical Moslems and emasculated Hindus, but
the English â the foremost nation in the world." Â¦
Only military experts can rightly estimate ; the
value of the strategy proposed, but the political
cleverness of the final statement can be appreciated by
aIL To drive the British wholly out of India would
be to release that power to oppose Russia elsewhere,
but to leave her there and then compel her to serve
Russian policies in all other parts of Asia is a stroke
of diplomacy worthy of the best masters of the art.
In the meantime, however, it will be remembered that
the man who sold the lion's skin while the lion was

?
Friends of the late Commander James j
\V. Carlin of the United States navy gath- j
ered around his body yesterday to pay a j
last tribute to his memory before his re
mains should be sent East for interment.
Services were held at the Unitarian j
church and were under the direction of his I
old friends of the Bohemian Club. Yes
terday morning the body, which had re
mained all night on the transport dock,
was escorted to the First Unitarian
Church at Franklin and Geary streets by
a detachment of bluejackets and marines
from the navy yard. The detachment was
headed by the marine band. The casket
was covered with the union jack, but at j
the church a pall of violets was thrown^
over all, hiding every part of the casket.
Following in the train were friends of
the deceased from civil life, officers of the
navy and retired officers, who had known
and loved him, and officers of the army.
Lieutenant E. T. Wilson of the Third Ar
tillery, aid to General Shafter, represented
the general, who could not attend.
Services at the church were brief. There !
was some munic by the choir and a eulogy !
for the dead, delivered by Rev. E. Brad- j
ford Leavitt, pastor of the church. He j
referred to the simple, unassuming char
acter of the man, his kindness ol heart, !
his good fellowship and his great physical i
and mental courage.
"Here was a good man and a true one." ;
he said in concluding his address. "He j
has gone from us. God bless his mem- :
ory." And every one who heard and knew
toe gallant officer re-echoed the words.
The services at the church being con
cluded the procession formed again and
the body was escorted to the ferry, where i
it awaited the afternoon train for the |
East. As the escort disbanded a bugler !
stepped to the head of the casket and !
blew taps.
Commander Carlin was a prominent !
member of the Bohemian Club. After his
return from Samoa, where he had gained \
world-wide fame for his heroism on the '
Vandalia in the great gale, the club gnve ,
him a dinner. Among the guests on that j
occasion was Rudyard Kipling. In rt- '
sponse to the lofty elofjuenee of Ger.cr \l I
Barnes, Stuart M. Taylor. Judge Boait i
and other orators of the club at that p^- i
riod. Carlin made a brief and modest
speech, in which he declared that the !
United States needed more ships. Tne i
modesty and simplicity of Carlin's bearing j
elicited the admiration of Rudyard Kip- :
ling, who was present, and the author's |
estimate of the brave sailor has a place
in English literature.
Commander Carlin was a brave and â¢
genial man, a true type of the American j
sailor. He was modest, or reticent, to a i
fault. He sought no political or personal j
influence to gain favored assignment to j
duty. He was grievously disappointed, i
however, when the Oregon sailed from ;
this bay for Cuba because he was not or- j
dered to duty on the battleship. The op- !
portunity for active service in a great
squadron, which he had for many years
hoped to obtain, vanished when the cre
gon sailed away.
Raphael Wolll. who was very fond of
Carlin, conducted such funeral arrange
ments as were, by the courtesy of the !
navy, allotted to the Bohemian Club. !
Among members of the club and others j
who paid tender homage to the memory

A MAIL CLERK'S EXPERIENCE
And What Came of It.
The occupation of a railivay mail clerk
is peculiarly arduous and unwholesome.
Long hours of Â¦work requiring the closest
Ettention. nearly always standing, con-
fined In a stuffy car. as well as the con-
tinual vibration of rapid motion, make
this occupation an undesirable one from
a health standpoint.
A railway mail clerk on the Michigan
Central running between Detroit and Chi-
cago cays: "In common with many of
my fellow employes, I suffered for some
years from an obstinate attack of piles,
brought on, my physicians told me, by
my occupation, the close confinement in a
car and being obliged to stand on my feet
for hours together: the pain at times was
almost unbearable and I was obliged to
resort to the use of ointments and salves
to give a temporary relief while I got
through with my work. I suffered so long
from piles that I really had little hope of
any such th!ng as a permanent cure, and
although I had very often noticed the ad-
vertisement of the Pyramid Pile Cure, yet
I never thought seriously of trying it un-
til one day after suffering more than
usual I dropped into a drugstore and
bought a 50c package. I tried it that night
and the complete relief from pain and
Itching .was delightful. 1 expected to be
as bad es ever the next day, as this had
been my usual experience with pile reme-
dies, but I was agreeably disappointed. I
used the Pyramid for fcome ten days or
two weeks and for nearly four years have
not had the slightest trouble from piles,
;ind consider my cure as little short of
marvelous."
The Pyramid Pile Cure is the most pop-
ular and successful of any pile cure; it is
the only pile cure that is sold by every
i:rugg:st in the United States and Canada.
Furthermore, the Pyramid Pile Cure has
J.een before the public for nine years and
lias been tested time and again by hun-
dreds of physicians and by thousands of
ji!le sufferers, and its. remarkable . merit
has been demonstrated in every form of
piles, protruding, itching or bleeding.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â Professor Walter Theo Scheele, a chemist, who
played a conspicuous part in the Carlisle Harris, Buchanan and Fleming mur
der trials, to-night made himself the subject of an experiment which may
have a most important bearing upon the Molineux case. In a small hotel on
the east side, In the presence of three witnesses, he drained to the dregs a
glass which apparently contained the precise mixture of bromo-seltzer and
cyanide of mercury which is believed to have killed Mrs. Adams.
Dr. Scheelo had met the three witnesses with the understanding that in
testing experiments which might bear upon the pending poison trial were to
be conducted upon several guinea pigs and rabbits. He had already admlnis -
tered cyanide of mercury in Its pure form to a healthy guinea pig, and it had
died In about an hour. To prove his theory that cyanide of mercury when
combined with bromo-seltzer would not kill, he mixed a dose of the two ingre
dients combined and placed a teaspoonful In half a glass of water, meantime
producing the second guinea pig, to which this preparation was to be admiu
istered. Suddenly the bromo-seltzer began to effervesce, bubbling up toward
the top of the glass. Dr. Scheele took a step backward and said quietly:
"Gentlemen, here's good luck to you all," and before those present
could prevent the act he drained the last drop from the glass. Professor
Scheele at 11:30 o'clock to-night, two hours after having swallowed the mix
ture, showed no apparent 111 effects from his experiment. .

CLOTHING STORE IS
DESTROYED BY FIRE
A BLAZE ON MARKET STREET
CAUSED A BIG LOSS.
Prompt Action of the Department
Prevents Destruction to Ad
joining Buildings.
Fire broke out shortly after 9 o'clock
last night In the clothing establishment of
J. Cohn & Co. at 775 Market street, and
for a short period the frame buildings ad
joining were in danger of total destruc
tion. Only the prompt arrival of Chief
Sullivan and his men prevented its spread.
Before the flames could be subdued the
stock of cloth in the place was completely
ruined. Water was poured into the burn
ing store in great volumes and within a
short space the stock was thoroughly
saturated with water. The liremen work
ed briskly and had the blaze under sub
jection in less than thirty minutes.
One of the proprietors of the establish
ment stated that the store had been
closed five minutes before the nre was
discovered. Ho was unable to account for
the blaze, but gave as his opinion that it
might have been caused by a defective
electric wire. He also stated that he val
ued the destroyed stock at $6000. It was
Insured for $2000.
The Minneapolis saloon, owned by
J. & D. W. McCarthy, which adjoined the
place of fire, was slightly damaged by
smoke and water.

MURDERER LYNCHED
BY A COLORADO MOB
Convict Reynolds, the Slayer of
Captain Rooney, Strung Up
at Canyon City.
CANYON CITT. Colo.. Jan. 27.â Thomas
Reynolds, the convict who. with three
<itherÂ«, escaped from the penitentiary af
ter murdering Night Captain William C.
Rooney, was captured to-night near Flor
ence, ten miles east of Canyon City, and
brought to this place in a wagon. Here
he nrma taken from the officers by a mob
and hanged to a telegraph pole.
Night Captain of Police Connor of Flor
ence. aFsisted by Policeman Powell, made
Â¦.he capture on the bridge of the Flor
ence and Cripple Creek Railroad, near
Florence. When word was sent to this
city of the capture a epecial train with
seven guards and a bloodhound were dis
patched to the scene. In the meantime
Capta'.n Connor had started overland with
Reynolds.
Immediately on receipt of the news at
Car.yon City the fire bells began to ring
and the residents were out en masse.
It was 10:45 when the carriage carrying
the bound form of the murderer crossed
the First street bridge under a guard of
four armed men. As the carriage passed
beneath the electric light at the center of
the bridge, men emerged from the dark
ness at eithe- end, closing in rapidly and
silently. Before the guards comprehended
what was Intended they were overpow
ered and disarmed.
Not a sound broke the stillness. There
*ere several hundred men in the crowd.
but apparently not one had a weapon.
The docmed man was dragged from the
vehicle and had hardly struck the ground
when a noose was slipped around his
neck and he was led to the nearest tele
graph pole. A man climbed the pole and,
throwing the rope over the cross-arm,
ehouted:
"Pull away!"
Immediately the noose tightened ur.der
thÂ« chin of the convict. Defore he was
lifted from his fret an opportunity was
given him to make a statement. He
made no offer to speak. The signal was
given and Reynolds was jerked into
eternity.
He was "game" to the last. He went
Into the air without a murmur. It was
then a shout broke from the mob.
When Reynolds was being bound in
Florence he asked the guard to put a bul
let through him before turning him over
to the citizens of Canyon City. The war
den was helpless. He sent his best men
to Florence, retaining only enough at the
prison to guard it. Expecting Reynolds
to be brought on the special train in
charge of Deputy Warden Sargent, he
had stationed extra guards at the depot
to render aid in case an attempt were
made to take the prisoner. All the guards
he could have mustered, however, would
have been powerless against the mob of
determined men.
It is said that Wagner, another es
caped convict, was with Reynolds when
he was first discovered, but escaped.
Reynolds and Wagner, with Antone
Wood and "Kid" Wallace, made their
escape from the penltentiarv last Monday
night. Elaborate plans had been made for
a general delivery of the prisoners, but It
was frustrated by the action of one of the
guards, who succeeded in giving the
alarm. Night Captain Rooney was
stabbed to death and two other guards
had been overpowered and bound when
the alarm was given and the four convicts
made a hasty escape without liberating
their fellow-prisoners.
On Wednesday night Woods and Wal
lace, who are mere boys, were captured
near Victor. Reynolds is understood to bo
tht? man who stabbed Captain Rooney,
Wagner holding the officer.

FIGHTS WITH ONE HAND.
Game Showing of Harry Forbes After
Injuring His Right Arm.
CHICAGO. Jan. 26.â With his right arm
helpless after the first round Harry
Forbes, by constant left-hand Jabbing,
managed to stand Maurice Rauch off for
six rounds to-night at the Fort Dearborn
Athletic Club, and the referee called It a
draw. In the first round Forbes tried Mc-
Governs style of playing for the stom
ach in the clinches. He had the better of
the fight while using McGovern's tactics,
but In one of the mix-ups his right arm,
which was injured in his fight with Young
Simister in New York two weeks ago. be
came useless and he had to depend on his
left for the rest of the flght.
Rauch tried hard to land a knockout,
tut Korbes was too fast and Jabbed him
Kroggy in the fourth round. Rauch had a
shade the better of Jt in the last two
rounds and landed telling swings to the
head. It was a fast flght from start to
finish. They met at 115 pounds at the
ringside.
In one of the preliminaries Ed Morris of
San Francisco was krrocked out In onÂ©
round by A hern of Chicago. Both are
colored welter-weights.

Hobart Eulogies in the House.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2C.-The greater
portion of the session of the House to-day
was devoted to eulogies of the life and
public services of the late Vice President
Hobart. The tributes paid to his memory
were not the usual perfunctory eulogies,
but breathed the love and admiration and
respect in which he was universally held.
Those who spoke were Gardner, Stewart,
Parker. Fowler and Daly, of New Jersey;
Payne of New York; Dalzell and Brosius
of Pennsylvania; Richardson of Tennes
see, and Griggs of Georgia. Before the
eulogies began the conference report on
the census bill was adopted and an at
tempt was made to pass a bill to pay the
MAJOR GENERAL ARCHIBALD GRAHAM WAVELL.
This officer was appointed to the command of the Fifteenth Brigade, Sev
enth Division (General Kelly-Kenny's) of the South African field force, made
vacant by the death of Major General Prior just as they were about to em
bark for their destination. His selection is considered a very happy onÂ«, as
he has seen much service in South Africa. Ho was born in* 1543 and entered
the army as ensign of the Forty-third Foot, now the Norfolk Regiment,
when he was twenty years of age. He passed through the Staff College In
18S4 and has since filled many Important regular and special appointments.
From IS6B to IS7O he was adjutant of the fort at King "Williams Town, Capo
Colony. In 1878-79 on special staff service in South Africa, In ISSO-81 he com
manded the Cape volunteer forces. In IÂ£3l he was promoted to the command
of the Second Battalion of the Black Watch and later made commander of
the Forty-second Regimental District, Perth, whence ho was transferred to
the staff at General Kelly-Kenny's headquarters. His latest duty has beÂ«n
ajÂ» assistant adjutant general at the recruiting headquarters, which has given
him a valuable knowledge of the material composing his command.

night discussed two bills now before Con
gress which affect the interests of orga
nized labor. One of the bills is intended
to regulate the civil service in the United
States. It provides for medical attend
ance at the expense of the Government for
employes under the civil service injured
or otherwise disabled while in active ser
vice. The bill received the unanimous In
dorsement of the council.
The other bill deals with convict-made
goods and their sale. It was referred to
the law and legislative committee.
.The executive committee, lo which was
referred the cloakmakers' trouble, re
ported that It had waited on Davidson &
Co , Meyer Bros, and M. Slmonoff. who
had locked out their employes because
they belonged to the union. These em
ployers had stated, the committee re
ported, that they intended to conduct
their business to suit themselves, without
regard to unionism. In view of thi3 state
ment it was deemed advisable to take
steps to declare a boycott against the
firms named.
The pavers' delegate reported that Gray
Bros, were employing non-union pavers to
the Injury of the Pavers* Union.
The council elected the following officers

TWO BICYCLISTS INJURED.
Habit of "Making Faces" Almost
Causes a Catastrophe.
A penchant for "making faces" almost
cost two unknown bicyclists â¢ their lives
last evening. While one of them was thus
fooling with John Barnes, grlpman of a
Haight street car, he ran Into another
wheelman and both sustained hard falls.
It was all the gripman could do to stop
the car in time to keep from crushing the
prostrate bicyclists.
The car was east bound and had nearly
reached Market street, when one of the
bicyclists passed in front of it. Barnes
rang his bell warningly, whereupon thÂ»
rider turned and executed a grimace. As
he did so he collided with another wheel
man, and riders and machines came down
in a heap.
A lady who was sitting: near the front
of the car screamed In fright and grabbed
the brake In an endeavor to stop the car.
She was too weak to accomplish the task,
but handicapped Barnes to an extent that
he managed to release her hold and stop
the car just as it touched the men. They
both rose and limped away to a neighbor
ing drug store, where it was afterward
learned that one had sustained a badly
bruised arm and the other several cuts
and bruises on the left side. Both men
were angry over the loss of their wheels,
which were smashed so badly as to bÂ«
rendered useless.

MINERAL LANDS
BILL FIGHT IS
TO BE RENEWED
Miners' Association
Makes Plans.
RAILROAD WILL OPPOSE IT
CALIFORNIA DELEGATION IS
FAVORABLE.
The executive committee of the Miners'
Association decided last night to uphold
the California Congressional delegation in
favor of the passage of the mineral lands
bill. The means adopted will be a letter
to be prepared setting forth all the facts
and also a map showing the necessity for
the bill, one striking exhibit on the map
being the Southern Pacific Company's
strip of land, forty miles wide, extending
clear from Marysville to the Oregon State
line. A copy of the letter and also the
map will be sent to every member of
Congress.
Before action was taken President
Ralston reported what he had learned in
Washington. He said he saw all the Cal
ifornia delegation, individually" and col
lectively, in reference to the bill, with
the exception of Senator Perkins. They
all favored the measure and he under
stood that Senator Perkins favored it.
Congressman de Vries has introduced it.
The Southern Pacific Company alone
was opposing the measure, Mr. Ralston
reported. The railroad had defeated it
before and would flght it this session.
He had been told so by Boyd, the South
ern Pacific lobbyist at Washington, and
he had heard it from an official of the
railroad since his return to this city.
The letter containing all the facts will
also be sent to the newspapers In Cali
fornia to publish. Mr. Ralston said that
public opinion was needed. He did not
think that the Southern Pacific Company
was anxious for any more fights than it
now had on hand. It had several and one
was at Sacramento, which might end in
a way that the railroad would not like.
In addition to the mineral lands bill the
subject of the contest between the min
eral land claimants and the agricultural
land "scrip" claimants In the oil belt
was taken up.- Judge Wright was author
ized to prepare a bill and a resolution was
also ordered favoring the mineral land
claimants. The committee on legislation
will also prepare a bill to be submitted
to the extra session of the Legislature
concerning the location law.

TURF CONGRESS DRAWN
INTO CORRIGAN'S FIGHT
Committee on Appeals Renders a Decision
That May Reopen the Local Race-
Track War.
Special rrlEyatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI. Jan. 26.â A decision ren
dered to-day by the committee on ap
peals of the Turf Congress, which met in
the Covington. Ky., office, has an im
portant bearing upon the fight that is go-
Ing on between President Thomas H. Wil
liam of the Oakland track in California
and Ed Corrigan. the controlling spirit of
the Inglefide and Tanforan tracks, near
San Francisco. Judge Joseph Murphy of
the Oakland track, having !n view the
case of Fred Mulholland. asked that the
appeals committee decide whether or not
rule IS was retroactive. At the last meet
ing of the Turf Congress in Chicago in
lSs'.<9. this rule was made to rea.d as fol
lows:
It i* the Judgment of tbÂ« committee on ap
perJs -that under the rcw" of the Turf Con-
X-â¢? to regulate racing ar.d to determine what
penona and hor*eÂ« shall participate therein
rule l!> applies January 1. I*oo, to all
Arsons ai'c h^reeÂ« ruled off cr expelled for a:i>
cause prior to that date.
Prior to this the rule read the same
way. with the exception that "for fraud"
Â¦was inserted. The rule was passed at
Chicago at the instance of Ed Corrlgan,
who aimed it at Fred Muiholland. at that
time in the employ of the Oakland track
a? natrol Judge. ' ";_ , , .
Back of this action of Corrtean s Is an
Interesting story. Fred Mulholland. In
1898 reported the races In San rraneisco
for the San Franclbco Call, and m the
course of events he severely criticized
the racing and the methods at Corrigan s
Irglcside track. This angered Corrigan.
who had Mulholland ruled off by the
Ir.gleside authorities, the action being
taken in June. IEÂ». President Williams
of the California Jockey Club promptly
took up Mulholland and appointed him
patrol judge at his track. Muiholland. not
having been ruled off for fraud, was eligi
ble to hold such position without the as
sociation employing him conflicting with
the rules of the Turf Congress.
â¢"Â¦"-'
This did not suit Corrigan, who accord
ingly had the new rule IS passed by the
Turf Congress, to be effective from jan
uary l, \'m. Thus, according to the new
rule. Mulholland would not be allowed
on any Turf Congress track or any other
track which was reputable and was recog
nized by the Turf Congress and Jockey
Persons ruled off for- other than fraud
prior to this new rule, however, claimed
it did not affect them, as it was not retro
active. Judge Murphy, to get a decision
upon the rule, asked the appeals commit
tee to interpret It. After deliberating up
on the rule. Messrs. E. F. Clay, George
Long and George Perkins, the appeals
committee, decided that the new rule af
fected all persons ruled off the turf for
any cause whatever, prior to its passage.
The decision of the committee is as fol
lows:
Every person or horse expelled or ruled oft
by any reputable runninsr asroclation or tba
National Trotting Association Â«=hall stand ruled
off the courts of the member* of the Congress
during the continuance of buch expulsion.
According to this decision, Mulholland
would not even be allowed on any Turf
Congress tracks or independent reputable
courses, and, while Oakland Is an inde
pendent organization and races under its
own rules, it has always followed the rul
ings of the Turf Congress and Jockey
Club. The decision of the appeals com
mittee is a victory for Corrigan, but It is
feared It will precipitate a light between
Oakland and the Turf Congress. Thomas
H. Williams is a bitter enemy of Corrigan
and will not even accept his entries at
Oakland, and it is feared he will disregard
the rulings of the appeals committee and
still employ Mulholland. In case Williams
stands by Mulholland. the Turf Congress
will be forced to take action against the
Oakland track. Thus it will be seen that
Corrigan has drawn the Turf Congress
into his fight against Williams, and, as
the latter is a fighter of no mean caliber,
the outcome will be watched with much
interest. There is a possibility of a bit
ter war being waged, the outcome of
Â¦tt-rHrh Is nrohlemnticol.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 27, 1900.
SCHADDE'S FORMER WIFE
PUT DIRECT QUESTIONS
"Bill Schadde," She Demanded, "Who Is
That Woman You Go Out With
Every Day {
FVBN though their quarrels resulted In divorce. William A. Sohadde,
well known in real estate circles, never suffered such an uncomforta
1 ble grilling from his former wife, Mrs. Anticia M. Schadde, as he got
1 7 yesterday in Judge Hebbard's court. Mrs. Schadde had her divorced
spouse in court on an order to show cause why he should not be punished
for contempt of court for failure to pay her each month a certain amount
of alimony. The hearing was in the embryonic stage, when D. S. O'Brien,
who represented Mrs. Schadde, expressed a desire to withdraw from the con
troversy. His wish was granted and, as he was leaving the court, he met
Mr. Schadde, to whom he bowed a greeting. Mrs. Schadde observed the
meeting of her late counsel and her late husband and immediately theorized
that a conspiracy existed. At this moment Judge Hebbard called for
Schadde to take the stajid. Schadde, as directed, mounted the steps to the
seat, and forthwith Mrs. Schadde seized the opportunity.
"I will plead ray own cause," she said; "I don't need an attorney; I will
cross-examine Mr. Schadde," and she squared herself for the effort.
"Bill Schadde. who is that woman you go out with every day?" she said,
addressing the astonished witness. "Isn't it a fact that you just got $400
and work in a bank?"
"It's none of your business who that woman is," answered Schadde-, when
he found his voice.
"Well, I puess it is. I want to know about that $400 and about that wo
man."
Here Judge Hebfcard interrupted counsel and advised her to get a law
yer. Mrs. Schadde insisted that she was thoroughly competent to handle
her own action, but the court, foreseeing the peril if matters were allowed
to run. postponed the case until next Friday. In the interim Mrs. Schadde
will get a lawyer and endeavor to locate Schadde's funds, part of which
the court promised her she should have in event of successful search.
McCONNELL
NO MATCH
FOR SMITH
Californian Knocked Out in
the Twenty-Second Round
by "Mysterious/
NEW YORK. Jan. 28.â At the Broadway
Athletic Club to-night "Mysterious Billy"
Smith of this city knocked out Frank
McConnell of San Francisco with a right
hook on the jaw in the twenty-second
round of what was to have been a twenty
five round bout. McConnell was the fa
vorite in the betting, odds of 100 to 70
being laid on him before the bout began.
Why he should have been made a favorite
over Smith was a puzzle to many, but
the odds were influenced presumably by
the showing the Californian made when
he met and defeated Jimmy Handler of
Newark on his lirst appearance in this
section. To-night from the first round
the Western man was never in it and
the odds on him quickly receded to even
money and then there was a good deal
of scurrying by the McConnell people to
hedge.
The men met at 14S pounds. The West
ern boxer had nearly two inches the bet
ter of his opponent as to height and cer
tainly looked to be in the better con
dition. Smith forced the pace from the
opening, playing for the stomach, but
McConnell sent his left to the wind and
head neatly. Smith countered with a
right on the face, bleeding Mac's nose,
and at close quarters he pounded thÂ»i
Western man over the kidneys. Smith
staggered McConnell in the fifth with a
right swing on the side of the head.
It was Smith's fight from the seventh
on. McConnell occasionally electrified
the spectators with some clever work
with both hands, but none of his blows,
although they landed on the face, neck
and the wind, seemed to hurt Smith.
Billy was always on the aggressive, while
his opponent used his legs to good ad
vantage in getting out of tight places.
Two or three times Smith forced his man
to the ropes, landing .left and right, and
seemed to have McConnell going, but
somehow or other he failed to follow up
his advantage and allowed McConnell to
ekip away and get "set" again before he
renewed his attack.
Toward the end of the fight Smith's
bulldog rushes were too much for tho
Western man. but at the close of the
twenty-first round the odds were on Mc-
Connell staying the limit.
However, the end came In the twenty
second After some sparring Smith forced
McConnell into this lauer's corner. There
Billy felntexl with his left for the body,
drawing McConnell's attention to the
preservation of his lower parts. This was
just what Smith had been "laying for."
The moment the <_alifornian dropped his
guard from the protection of the jaw
Smith, with a half-swinging hook, landed
his right on the mark and McConnell fell.
His head struck the lloor within a few
inches of his anxious handlers, who
threw a towel into the ring and jumped
in to look after their man. McConnell
lay for several minutes flat on his back,
but the club's physician revived him with
in six minutes so that he was able to
walk out of the ring with the assistance
of his seconds. The time of the last
round was thirty-seven seconds.
SENSATIONAL
FINISH IN
THE RING
Johnson Knocks Out Dean at
the End of the Tenth
Round,
The boxing exhibition of the Columbia
Athletic Club last night was appropriate
ly opened and closed with knockout blows.
The end of the last bout, which was be
tween Charles Johnson and Jack Dean,
came in a sensational manner. For eight
rounds the boxing was slow, and the spec
tators took only a passive interest In the
proceedings.
In the ninth round Johnson started at a
fast pace and stirred up the fighting blood
in Dean. The latter soon had a decided
lead over his opponent, landing repeat
edly with right and left on head. It
looked easy for Dean at the end of the
round. When they came up for the las=t
round Dean seemed the stronger. He had
Johnson in trouble, when the latter landed
a right swing unexpectedly, knocking
Dean down. He stood up and groped Ms
way to his corner, where Johnson finished
him just as the bell sounded the end of
the tenth round and the fight. Dean all
not recover for some -time.
Harry Trost opened proceedings by
knocking out Kid Finnerty In the second
round. The youngsters battered each
other around the ring while the bout was
on. Trost was knocked clean off his feet
in the second round. This stirred him to
action and he punched the "Kid" In every
corner of the ring. Finnerty finally fell
before the onslaught and was counted
out.
B. "Wilts and T. Marich boxed four hur
ricane rounds, when Sergeant of Police
Shea ordered Referee McGlnley to stop
hostilities. Both men bled profusely and
presented a gory spectacle. Wilts was
much taller than his adversary? who made
up for this in cleverness and gameness.
Marich tired badly in the third round and
he lost much of his speed. Both scored
clean knockdowns several times. Both
were weak when the bout was stopped
and declared a draw.
Jack Hall refused to keep his engage
ment to meet Henry Lewis and Charles
Thurston took his place. It was agreed
the bout would be declared a draw If both
boxers were on their feet at the end of
eight rounds. They started at high Rpeed,
but the spectators saw at once there was
no steam in the blows. The second round
was the Fame, but in the third and fourth
rounds they livened up matters and some
rtiff blows were exchanged. The bout
went the limit.

8Fairmount Improvements.
The Fairmount Improvement Club de
cided last night to petition the Super
visors to remove "Garnier's monument"
from the center of Palmer street. The
"monument" is a manhole, ten feet above
the street, but which should be ten feet
below the street It is a menace to travel
and of no possible use except to illustrate
past methods of the surveyor's office. The
club also opposed the building of the
new City and County Hospital in the
Almshouse tract, believing it should be
built on the elte where the branch jail
stands. The grading of Chenery street is
now prevented because of an old Spring
Valley main that is above the level In
the center of the street and the club will
take steps to have it removed.
John Magee's Funeral.
The funeral of John Magee, who re
cently died at the Occidental Hotel, has
caused considerable gossip on account
of what Is regarded as the Inexplicable
conduct of his wife. Magee attained
prominence by getting Into trouble with
the Guatemalan republic and receiving
fifty lashes as a reward for his temerity,
Great Britain finally taking cognizance
of the affair and forcing the Central
American republic into making amends
to him in the sum of $50,000. It was sup
posed that Magee was many times a mil
lionaire, but he had a good deal of
trouble in obtaining money enough to
meet current expenses, and several dis
patches were required in order to get his
wife, who lives in Paris, to take any no
tice of his illness. She finally sent word
that 52000 would be found to his credit
In a local bank, but at his death sent
word to bury him with as little expense
as possible. It is not known whether Ma
gee'a great resources had become im
paired, or whether he and his wife had
separated.

STRONG BICYCLER.
His Idea of Tea and Coffee.
"As a traveling representative of the
Cycling Gazette and a good wheelman,
I wish to Â«ay something regarding the
use cf tee anÂ£ soffee.
"Two years ago 1 was almost an in-
valid. To-day I am mgged and strong,
and able to ride a wheel seventy-five
miles a day. Formerly I was addicted
to coffee and tea, but was compelled to
give them up and took to drinking Pos-
tum Food Coffee, for I knew that many
wheel riders used it. The effect on my-
self and family his been very remark-
able.
"The sustaining power of Postum
Food Coffee is wonderful. Many a
time I have gone out early in the morn-
ir-g for a ride, taking only a drink of
Postum before starting and no other
food before noon.
"Much depends on the making. A
Fkillful cook can made good coffee â
i- c. t the better the cook the better the
coffee, but anybody tvho knows enough
to boil water can make good Postum
if they will only use a .large pc Â» that
will not let it boil over and then boil
it lonpr enoujrh. Fou cannot spoil it by
boilir.j? it too long. It won't be muddy,
but always settJes clear in a moment.
"Xo pecuniary inducement one could
offer would temnt me to leave off Pos-
tum Food Coffee and take up ordinary
tea and coffee again, for I esteem my
health and strength too highly.
"With my hearty wishes for your
continued success, which Postum fully
merit?."â C. A. Jackson, 24 Anderson

NICARAGUA CANAL
BILL IS CHANGED
Appropriation Feature
Altered.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â The House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce to-day reconsidered the Nica
ragua canal bill, which had been reported
with an appropriation of $140,000,000, and
changed the appropriation section bo as
to make $10,000,000 available, with author
ity to contract for the entire excavation
and completion of the canal at a total
copt Â»ot exceeding $140,000,000.
Before this action was taken Hepburn,
chairman of the committee, said that as
all the members of the committee were
anxious for the success of the bill It was
well to consider some objections which
had been raised. He had heard several
objections on the ground that the whole
$Uo.Ot>J,ovo was appropriated now and
three or four gentlemen had said they
would not support the bill if the entire
turn were appropriated now, but would
support It only if a portion were made
available at once to begin the work.
Corliss of Michigan thereupon offered
the following new section, which was
adopted:
Section Â«. That the sum of J10.000.000 is
hereby appropriated out of any money in the
Trehfury net otherwise appropriated, toward
the project herein contemplated, and the Secre
tary of War is further hereby authorized to
tnter into a contract or contracts for materials
and work that may be deemed necessary for
the proper excavation, construction, defense
end completion of paid canal, to bÂ« paid for as
appropriations may from time to time be here
after made, not to exceed In the aggregate
J140.000.W0.
Mr. Fletcher of Minnesota aeked
"When you get that canal half built for
$140,000,000 what will you do for the other
half?'
Corliss answered that the highest esti
mate of cost thus far made was $133,000.-
WW. Hepburn added that In the amended
form the bill simply applied the contract
pystem and limited the aggregate to $140,
000.000. In the amended form the bill was
ordered reported.
The Pacific cable bill was taken up and
General Swayne of New York spoke in
favor of private construction and opera
tion of the cable lines, as against Gov
ernment ownership.

SIXTY SAMPLES
FOUND UNFIT TO
BE USED AS TEA
Experts Report to the
Appraiser.
Â»
NEW YORK'S GAME EXPOSED
Â«
MR. DARE SPEAKS HIS MHO)
FREELY.
United States Tea Examiner Cornelius
Toohey and Tea Expert Charles B. Platt
have concluded their examination of the
300 samples of tea forwarded from New
York by the tea expert at that port.
They found that sixty of the samples rep
resented tea of a quality much below the
Government standard and to preclude its
admittance at this port. It should have
been rejected at Xew York.
They will so report to the Secretary of
Â¦the Treasury and will furnish him with
evidence of the existence of a plat on the
Atlantic seaboard to divert all the tea
importations from San Francisco to New
l'ork and make the Eastern seaport the
sole port of entry for the valuable com
modity.
The news caused much commotion yes
terday in local commercial circles. It haa
been suspected all along that such a plot
was in course of development, but the
absolute proof was not obtained until yes
terday.
No blame is attached to the Secretary
of the Treasury for making the order re
quiring that samples of all teas admitted
or rejected at United States ports should
be stnt for revision to the tea expert
at New York, the object of the Treasury
Department being to have the Govern
mental standard interpreted in a uniform
manner. There is no doubt that the reve
lations made will induce the Secretary ta
adopt some other plan of accomplishing
this object and. place the work of re
vision in the hands of disinterested per
sons.
Messrs. Toohey and Platt, the tea ex
aminer and expert, respectively, declined
to make public the result of their investi
gations, but United States Appraiser John
T. Dare consented to make a full state
ment. In order that the business of this
port might be protected against the un
derhanded encroachments of rival ports.
"In August and September, 1599," Mr.
Dare said, "the tea importers of New
York asserted their belief that tea was
being admitted at San Francisco that
would, if examined at New York, be re
jected. They reiterated that statement
and finally induced the Board of Tea Ex
perts at New York to appeal to the Sec
retary of the Treasury. In that appeal
they alleged absolutely that unfair teas
were being admitted at San Francisco.
In October Assistant Secretary Spauld
ing. wholly intent upon securing a uni
form application of the tea act, requested
me to forward to New York triplicate
samples of all teas, both approved and
rejected. This office promptly replied that
we were in full sympathy with the hon
orable Secretary in his efforts to secure
uniformity in the application of the regu
lations, and we at once forwarded from
San Francisco to New York the triplicate
samples requested, suggesting at that
time that, in furtherance of the design
of the Secretary to secuno such uniform
ity, New York should send to us samples
of tea which had been passed upon by
the New York expert.
"Our request was not at once granted,
and we continued to forward our samples
to New York and, so far as we had been
officially informed, there had been no ma
terial changes. Assistant Secretary
Spaulding then yielded to the request that
New York send Borne of her samples to
San Francisco.
"We have received from time to time
about 300 samples. Sixty of those have
been found unfit and Bhould have been
rejected at the port of New York. There
is no bias in this matter whatever, for
Mr. Platt and Mr. Lovell and Mr. Bain
have approved of the findings of Mr.
Toohey." t

A NEW PASTOR
TO PREACH ON
THE SABBATH
REV. F. W. CLAMPETT.
Rev. Frederick W. Clampett, the new
rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, will
preach his initial sermon to-morrow
morning. The reverend gentleman's fame
as an orator has preceded him and a
large congregation will listen to his open
ing sermon.
The members of the vestry of Trinity
Church have received a number of un
solicited letters from fellow ministers and
members of Dr. Clampett's former con
gregations in which they extol his vir
tues and ability. One gentleman, writing
from Springlield, 111., gives the following
as an instance of the doctor's capacity for
work and ability to add members to his
church:
Af> his warden It was my privilege to be In
timately associated with him throughout his
work hire as the first rector of Christ Church.
It was a great work that he did for us. When
he came to us from St. Bartholomew, New
York, he found us a "feeble folk." without or
ganization, with no church building and with
hardly enough vitality to assert our right to
existence. We began our services in rented
quarters, under most discouraging circum
stances. Our effort to found a new parish was
wholly an experiment. It was doubtful if we
would be able to pay him even the Flender
Etlpend of $75 per month, but he did not hesi
tate. He began to preach to not over ten or
a dozen people. In two weeks he had a house
full. In a month we had to teek larger quar
ters. In six months we had the largest con
gregation in the city and in a year we had
a pretty stone church, seating 400 people, cost
ing $3i'i,ooo, built, raid In full, and dedicated,
with a $3500 organ and many lovely memorials.
The congregation was second to none In the
diocese. When he left us, to our great regret,
after three years' most successful ministry,
to accept duty in a laiger field at Columbus,
Ohio, we were established and have ever flnce
had an acknowledged position of usefulness and
power In the work of the Master and In the
affairs of the diocese.

ANNUAL REUNION.
A reunion of Episcopal churchwomen in
commemoration of the twentieth anniver

Woman** Auxiliary took place yesterday
cfurr.txm in the parlors of Trinity
Church. Bush and Cough streets, the at
tendance being 60 large that many were
Obliged to stand.
The ladies, ministers and laymen at
tending tne reunion were welcomed by the
j'Tvsinent, Mrs. James Newlands, who
Ftated that the auxiliary had been orga
nized in ISO 9 by representative women of
eight parishes. There had originally been
cne hundred and sixty charier members,
of whom only sixty nre living.
Bishop Nichols delivered an amusing
end instructive address on the theme
"Our Future." which he declared that it
was the work of noble women that had
contributed largely toward keeping a
rrogreFsive spirit alive in the church. He
called upon thÂ«Â» ladles to crystallize their
energies toward m.iking the great con

Mrs. A. M. Lawyer road a letter fmra
Chaplain Walter Marvin, now at Manila,
in which he expressed the belief that the
Philippines are the gateway through
Â¦which entrance must be made for the
Christianizing of the Orient. He thought,
however, that this would never be accom

limtherly love, by building schools and
establishing hospitals and other agencies
of civilization. Rev. C. S. Linsley fol

XVI. THE CARE AND EDUCA
TION OF CHILDREN.
BY LUCY WHEELOCK.
The Care of Infancy.
We have been slow to learn the lesson
of the Great Teacher, who set a child in
the midst of his disciples as an object ol
reverence and study. Man has taken all
knowledge as his province and left as that
last to be conquered a knowledge of the
human being destined to make the world
that Is to be.
Classical learning has absorbed the at
tention of scholars to the exclusion of the
study wMch really concerns the welfare
of the human race. Spencer lamented in
his time the inadequacy of the school ctii
rlculum, which made elaborate prepara
tion for everything but the highest of rill
functionsâ that of parenthood. He pictures
the amazement of some antiquary of the
future who should unearth text books and
school papers, and finding no reference to
training for such duties should conclude
them to be relics of a race of celibated.
" 'Tis true 'tis pity," and alas! it is still
true. An examination of the curricula of
most of our colleges and seminaries wculrl
reveal the same inadequacy to meet the
real needs of life. The higher education
of women does not ordinarily include any
reference to the possibility of mother
hood. But there are signs of promise. A
few courses of study are offered here and
there based on an enlightened conception
of the high calling of woman, as "the firit
priestess of the human race." Mothers'
clubs and classes for mothers in our kin
dergarten training schools are springing
up all over the land in evidence of an
awakening public sentiment as regards
the responsibility of the care of child
hood.
The overwhelming attendance and the
great enthusiasm shown at the first moth
ers' congress, held three years ago in
Washington, was a surprise, even to its
promoters. It was convincing testimony
of a growing sense of need on the part
of many women. Another promising sign
of the times is the wealth of child study
literature. In the second edition of Tra
cy's "Psychology of Childhood," published
in 1594, he refers to no less than lus pub
lished sources of information. The list
would now be largely Increased. Since
Preyer's notable record of his observa
tions of an individual child there have
been many studies of this sort, the larger
portion of which concern themselves with
the period of infancy. The interest in
child study, largely promoted by Dr. Hall
and his associates, has acted like leaven
throughout the country. T^ie "div:nÂ»
Plato" has never been alone in recognizing
the importance of beginnings,
when a thing is young and tender." lint
practice must always lurk far behind th<_
cry. and there is still need of some apos
tles of childhood to convince motht-rs
everywhere that the foundation of all tu
ture physical and moral well-being must
be laid deep in the soil of infancy.
Food.
."As a man eateth so is he is a philo
sophical statement of a truth which moth
ers and nurses reed often to rehearse to
themselves. Whether the child is to be
well or ill. strong or weak, sluggish or
active, Self-controlled or the unhappy vic
tim of a morbid appetite, depends largely
on kind and amount of food and regular
ity of feeding. These matters are not to
be decided by the advice of fond grand
mothers or the traditions of nurses, but
by the scientific knowledge of the mother
trained to understand the physical needs
of an Infant. One of the most helpful of
recent books, Louise E. Hogan's "Study
of a Child," gives a faithful and impart!*!
record of the life of a normal child. The
points most insisted upon in the manage
ment of the young child were regularity
in matters pertaining to physical care
and non-interference with the developing
mind, that there might be free play of
the Individuality and self-activity.
The care taken to insure right habits of
body and mind on the part of all who
came into any relations with the child
might well serve as a model In other
homes. In his "Christian Nurture."
which has become a classic. Dr. Bushnell
lays emphasis on the fact that injudicious
fee/ling in babyhood and highly seasoned
and rich foods are the prolific sources of
perverted appetite and gross excess. In
temperance is excess or lack of modera
tion, and its seeds are sown whenever
and wherever the senses of the young
child are allowed to become masters
rather than servants. Froebel has devot
ed two of his songs in the "Mutter und
Kose-Lleder" to a consideration of the
senses of taste and smell, showing the
importance of cultivation of these 'min
isters of the mind" through the medium
of the baby plays. He advises that the
child's attention be diverted during eat
ing by a moving bird in a cage which can
be fed, or by the suggestion of sharing
the food with some other pet. This pre
vents the food and Its enjoyment from
becoming an end in itself.
Clothing.
"Our first gifts to our children are fet
ters," writes Rousseau, in condemning
the customary method of clothing Infants.
The traditional long clothes and bands
must impede the freedom of movement
recessary to develop muscular strength.
The emancipated mother discards all elab
orate long skirts and dresses and makes
her baby comfortable In slips. Like
the Froebel mother, she watches the free
play of the limbs and rejoices in the
growing strength of her baby, as she
sings:
In and out! In and out!
Toss the little limbs about.
Toss the little baby feet;
That's the way to grow, my sweet.
Environment.
Environment Is anothtr emphatic word
In the mother's vocabulary. What the
baby is first to see, what he Is first to
hearâ these are matters of prime impor
tance. "Through the senses the child's
soul lies open. Keep the impressions
pure." Who has seen a baby Btretch out
his little hands and coo with delight be
fore some favorite picture without realiz
ing the need of a wise selection of scenes
and subjects for the nursery walls? And
let the picture be hung for the baby's
eyes and not for the adult visitor. Love
of order and habits of neatness, regularity
and punctuality have their genesis in the
orderly surroundings and examples of the
nursery period. The importance of guard
ing the early Influences surrounding the
child is nowhere more clearly set forth
than In Froebel's collection of songs and
plays for mothers and children. In the
arrangement of the songs we discover the
order and time of manifestation of the
various psychic activities of the infant.
The pictures In the first part of the book
portray successive scenes In the great
drama of unfolding consciousness. The
first picture shows the physical moment,
when the infant, "new to earth and sky,"
vaguely begins to feel that "This is I."
The succeeding play songs illustrate such
physical experiences as the first Imitative
act, betokening the birth of will; the cus
ual notion Indicated by the why and what
of the childish questions, the recognition
of change and time, thedevelopmentof the
senses from the lower subjective sensations
of taste and smell to the higher activity
of sight, the gradual grouping of sensa
tions Into ever clearer perceptions and the
formation of Ideas of form, size and num
herâ "three paths to the goal of knowl
edge."
But the mother's Interest in her child Is
not psychologtc, and the chief value of
Froebel's book for her lies in the hints
and suggestions given to guide her In hÂ»r
dally Intercourse with her little one. Its
avowed aim Is to replace the mother in
stinct by Insight, to add to the mother
love "the sweet reasonableness" which
shall Insure true nurture. There is no
need to create artificial experiences as In
Rousseau's "Emlle" to teach the lessons
of life. The experiences come of them-
selves.
The scientific understanding of the in-
fant's bodily needs, the elimination ot all
harmful Influences In the nursery t-n
vlronment, with the selection of tho gocd,
and the loving wisdom which "suffers"
the free play of the spontaneities of ba
byhood, guiding them to the formation ot
right habitsâ these are the essentials
the care of infancy.
The Kindergarten Age,
The ideal of the kindergarten Is Indi
cated in its nameâ the child garden. A
garden is a place for growth under cul
ture. Freedom, space and time are ne
cessary conditions of growth in any gar
den, and cultivation is no less essential
for the fullest flowering and fruitage.
A kindergarten is not "a merry-go
rouiui" for the amusement of children,
neither is it a device for cramming inno
cent children with premature knowledge.
It is a place where living and real chil
dren are treated as growing plants with
respect to all the laws of natural devel
opment. It ia a place where the need of
individual treatment is considered as the
gardener considers the peculiar needs of
the rose and lily and gives to each soil
and sunshine and care as required by tho
nature of the plant.
The forcing process Is foreign to the
true kindergarten, which does not desire
to produce hothouse plants, even if they
bloom earlier. Froebel's method is "pass
ive, observant, following." The keynote
of his system is self-activity. His aim
is "to give men themselves." The agencies
which he employs in the kindergarten are
chiefly songs and games, gifts and occu
pations.
Songs and Games.
In the piays of children Froebel discov
ers "the heart leaves of the future." The
child is most truly himself when he
plays. All hia energies are employed,
frequently his special powers and ten
dencies are expressed in this free mani
festation of self. An English writer on
this subject characterizes neglect in fos
tering such special tastes and capacities
as ruthless waste of national capital. It
is possible that child study in the kinder
garten may prevent some of thi3 waste,
especially when mothers and klnder
gartners have the frequent opportunities
for conference afforded by the mothers'
meetings.
Long before Froebel's time Plato. Quin
tilian and other educational writers had
insisted upon tho value of the plays of
children as a "preparation for the seri
ous business of life," but it was reserved
for "the apostle of childhood" to fathom
"the deep meaning which oft lies hid in
childish play" and to make it the corner
stone of his educational foundation.
The musical setting of the kindergarten
plays makes them "orderly and law
abiding" and through the medium of sonc
we believe with Plato that rhythm and
grace enter into the recesses of the soul
and abide there. The organized play,
when rightly conducted, preserves the
true balance between lawful liberty and
license, and in nowise interferes with the
spontaneity of childhood. Freedom and
law are inseparable terms, and one of tho
Important lessons of the kindergarten
game is that the good of the Individual
is conditioned by the good of the whole.
The only one who isn't happy is the one
who won't play. Consideration of others
and subordination of self are common,
plain virtues to he acquired only by "daily
act and habitude." The kindergarten play
circle is the school for these social vir
tues because all must play together la
order to play at all.
Imitation.
Froebel was the first of ehiM students
to discover the significance of Imitation
in child llfÂ«\ "What man tries to repre
sent, that he begins to understand" is his
motto. Imitation is necessary as a means
of understanding. "Let me do and I shall
know" is the implicit faith of the child.
"I will fly like a bird and run like a pony
and hop like a frop, and so I shall be
come each of them. Let me do what
mamma does and I shall be mamma." So
through varied and constant imitations
children imitate themselves into the com
plexities of the life around them. Froeb^l
would utilize this instinct for imitation
by giving a wide range to play and di
recting it to an educational end. His spe
cial plays include those which represent
movements in the plant and animal worid,
the family and other relationships and
domestic and industrial activities. The
miner, the farmer, the baker, the car
penter are true heroes of toil because
they are necessary to make the wheels
of the great world turn round. The Heal
of service which Mrs. Eliot advocates as
one of the functions of education in a
democracy is embodied in these trade
plays, which illustrate the dependence of
one upon another and the beauty of co
operation.
The Gifts.
No agency of the kindergarten has been
so much questioned and so often pervert
ed as the gifts. Froebel did not Intend
them to become a means of instruction
in geometry and arithmetic, but rather to
furnish an "alphabet of things" by which
the young pupil in nature's school may
begin "to spell out the volume of the
universe." He attaches great importance
to the selection of children's playthings,
which are to serve as mediators between
themselves and the world. A wise giver
bestows the "gift" which helps the child
to realize himself by giving free play to
the fancy and scope to the constructive
powers. "Let me see," "Let me do" are
the constant demands of the normal child.
Through clear seeing the world-chaoa is
gradually to be reduced to order. Defi
nite perceptions in place of confused and
vague notions of things axe to b*. ac
quired through forming the habit of in
terested observation and attention to what
one sees. The kindergarten playthings
are intended to facilitate this process of
observation and comparison by supply
ing standards of form, color, size arid
number.
It is needless to state that the special
"gifts" do not exclude the use of ra
tional objects, but lead to a larger inter
est in seeing and usinjr all other good
gifts of a wise Giver. They are only the
alphabet, not the volume.
The material of the gifts offers noth
ing novel. Balls, blocks and rings tire
common playthings. As used in the kin
dergarten they satisfy the constructive
Instinct which would recreate the world.
The simple and manageable material
lends itself readily to the desires of the
mind. The value over other material lies
in the fact of organization and progres
sion, so that the child grows by what
he does and fines at every stage what 13
suited to his needs.

Saturday, February 3.

Â»
Only three vessels arrived in port yes
terday up to sp. ni. One ot" these was the
new steam schooner \V. H. Kruger, which
came down from Grays Harbor tn tow of
the tug Astoria. She will be engincd here
and will then go into the coasting trade.
The others were the schooner Bculah from
Wlllapa and the steamer Luella from San
I'edro.
For several weeks to come shipping on
the bay will be very quiet, as nearly all
the deep-water fleet expected has put in
an appearance. The A. G. Hopes is now
out lc- days from New Y/crk, but she only
left Montevideo on October SJ. She was
eaufiiiu iv a pampero on: the River l J latta
anu had to put ju there With her rudiier
iiead twisteu. The Musselcrag is now out
il*Â» days from Antwerp, but the was
caught in the October hurricanes off the
Horn, and being disabled hud to turn tail
and n:ake lor eSan Francisco by way of
the Cape of Good Hope. She is now in
Sydney, X. S. \V., into which port she put
in distress on January 12. The Cajirobert
is now out 230 days from Hamburg, but
e he had to put into Valparaiso short of
water, and only sailed from there for San.
Francisco on December 7. The Black
braes is now out 22*s days from Newcastle
On Tyne, but on .November 4 she put into
Port Stanley with her decks damaged.
The EmlUe Galine is now out -03 aays
from Swansea, but on November 2& she
only left Rio de Janeiro, having put in
there several weeks earlier partially dis
masted.
The British ship Reliance is now out
201 days from Hamburg, and at one time
20 per cent reinsurance was paid on her.
On January 21 she was spoken within a
few hundred miles of San Francisco and
should make port any day now. The Lyn
ton is also out 142 days from Newcastle
on Tyne. Outside of these there is not an
other deep-water ship due. Consequently
the arrivals for several weeks to come
will be fuw and far between, and the coal
dealers will have no English or Australian
black diamonds to help them out.
The stranding of the collier Miami in
Oyster Bay will also curtail the coal sup
ply. She carried about 4000 tons and made
about three trips a month. No vessel can
now be secured to take her place, so for
the next four weeks at least the supply of
domestic coal will be reduced by at least
10.<.Â«A> tons. Private dispatches say the
Miami lies in a very dangerous position,
but that if the weather keeps moderate
the coal may be lightered and the ship
paved. There is no insurance on the cargo.
The steamer is valued at $150,000 and there
is Jl&,</Â«) insurance on her in San Fran
cisco offices. $2500 in Victoria, B. C, and
the remainder in England.
The German four-masted ship Potosi.
the largest sailing vessel in the world,
wa? one of the victims of the October
pales off the Horn. A private letter to
parties in this city states that she was
caught in some terrific weather and hail
ail her upper topmasts carried away, be
sides being damaged about the decks. She
was compelled to put back to Port Stanley
for repairs. The Potosi is 2554 tons net
burden, or 1355 tons larger than the Brit
ish ship Kelburn, the largest, sailing yes- ;
eel now In port.
The naval reserve training ship Marlon
will be open to receive visitors to-morrow.

COLLIER MIAMI
A TOTAL WRECK
Broke in Two When the
Tide Went Out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C.J Jan. 26.â The steamer
Miami Is a total loss. She has broken In
two parts and one half this morning slid
down into deep water. Her captain and
crew have abandoned her and were taken
to Chemanlus by the tug Lome. Further
details of the wreck were brought by the
Lome. She reports that the Miami left
Oyster Bay at 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing in charge of Pilot Butler, with 5000
tons of coal for San Francisco.
It seems that she was taking a short cut
between Danger Reef and White Rocks,
where there is a channel half a milÂ© wide,
Instead of going by the generally used
track to the north of Danger Reef, where
a beacon has recently been established.
She was running at full speed and sud
denly brought up with a crash that shiv
ered her from end to end. She was hard
and fast on a reef. The tide was full, and
as It fell the middle of her hull settled
down and either end sagged away, as
there was nothing to support them. The
collier Bristol and tugs Lome and Pilot
endeavored in vain to haul her off. They
could not move her. and as the tide
dropped she fell apart.
This morning the two pieces weTe
wrenched apart Just forward of the
bridge, and the forward end sank out of
sight. The after end was awash and
gradually sliding down into the sea. Ste
vedore i'orke. who went up last night
with scows, is endeavoring to save some
of her cargo. An investigation will be
held here when the captain and crew ar
rive. They are expected by to-morrow's
train.

NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Exceptions to the quiet and even
dullness shown by the many lines of trade and
epeculatlon are found In the active demand for
woolen goods for next fall's delivery and In the
active call for dry goods on spring account.
In the latter direction prices show special
strength and the bulk of the business placed In
woolens has been at an advance of 25 to 40 per
cent. In other linen notable steadiness Is shown
In prices. Weather conditions throughout the
country part of the week have been against
trade In seasonable goods, arid there Is very
general complaint of large stocks of winter
goods In the hands of this branch of trade.
Another effect of the unusually mild weather
ts that shown In the Northwestern lumber
business. The lack of snow will probably In
sure a reduction on the cut of last year and
this, combined with smaller stocks, points to at
least a maintenance of present lumber quota
tions. Woolen manufacturers have constituted
an exception to the general quiet. They
opened their order books this week, and an
unusually heavy volume of business la re
ported to have been recorded.
Cotton goods are reported In good demand in
nearly all markets and the confidence as to
spring business in dry goods and clothing Is a
notable feature. In sharp contrast. In fact,
with the reports received from retailers as to
the present season's business in winter wear
goods. Scarcity of water Is complained of as
limiting the output of New England cotton
mills, which are reported as backward In de
liveries. The unsatisfactory business at retail
In boots and shoes Is reflected In some easing
of leather prices, and hides are actually lower
on the week.
Coffee has remelned strong throughout the
Business was livelier on the morning session
of the Bond Exchange, and fluctuations were
more numerous. The sugar stocks were- slight
ly off. as will be seen by the sales. Contra
Ccsta . Water sold from $74 50 down to $74.
There were sales of Safe Deposit at $97*338.
Sales were free In the afternoon, but varia
tions were narrower. Alaska Packers" ' so!d
down to $117 50.
The Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Com
pany paid a dividend of 50 cents on the 23th.
The Homestake Mining Company paid a divi
dend of 25 cents per share and an extra of
the same amount on the 25th.
At the annual meeting of the Kilauea Sugar
Company on the 2-Jth the old officers were re
elected. The estimate of 5000 tons of sugar
for the last campaign was exceeded by 500
tons. The estimate for the campaign just be
gun has been again placed at SOOO tons.
The Giant Con. Powder has Increased Its
dividend from 60 cents to 73 cents per share,
the first at the latter rate having been de
clared payable on February 10. Tho annual
meeting was held on Wednesday and the old
officers were re-elected.

EASTERN MARKETS.
Neva York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â The record of the day
on Wall street was a repetition of yesterday's
Inertia, but prices went down Instead of up
es *as the case yesterday. The retirement
of the British from Fplon Kop had aÂ« little
Influence as did the previoua day's news of the
success there. The o;*nlng market prices
ehowed eharp declines. International stocks be
ing quoted at about the London parity. The
weakness in London induced co celling here,
however; the local traders were disposed to
buy the stocks offered for London account In
the same way that they sold yesterday to mÂ»et
the Lonflon demand. No attempt was apparent
to bid up prices as the local dealers seemed
content to take the offerings at the London
level cf prices. The salea for London account
were estimated at something over 20,000. very
evenly distributed amocg the various inter
national stocks. This constituted th- bulk of
the day's business In railroad stocks and prices
in that department never got far from the
opening level. Much the greater portion on
the day's ema.ll business was In the speculat
ive industrials and specialties. These were
weak from the start. The weakness In Sugar
â¢u-as attributed to operations by a speculative
clique. Metropolitan made a momentary show
of firmness on the belief of a hitching in
the closing of the contract for the rapi 1
tranfit tunnel. The Rubber stocks, which have
not b*en active recently, were forced down 4
and 3 points respectively, but recovered 2
taints each. On tne curb New Ameterdam Gas
was rather active and strong and Standard Oil
advanced to a new high level. Returns by
tht leading banks of the currency movement
tor the week indicate that the net receipts
for the interior by express have been but
filghtly less than last week, but the gains
on 6ub-tr*aaury operations were little more
than half thoee of la6t week owing to dimin
ished ptr.fion disbursements and continued
h<Â»avy revenue receipts. The total gain In cash
for ttv banke is estimated at near $7,000,000.
It ie evident that ftock exchange operations
have madÂ» no demands on the loan accounts
of the banks. But the placing of time loans
and the buying of mercantile paper may have
further expanded loan accounts. Tbe sale of
New York City bonds during the week may
also be reflects in the loan account.
The btnd market made progress toward dull
neÂ«s and the tone was rather easier. Total
eal**. par value, $1,505,000.

In the country there Is nothing strange about
the outside figure. Tha Butter business needs
overhauling more than any other line of trade
in California, and It will be at sixes and sevens
until an exchange is established. These fights
between dealers serve no other purpose than to
demoralize prices.

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â Bradstreefe Financial
Review of the New York stock market to-
In spite of the increasing supplies of money
and further weakness In Interest rates, the
speculation In securities has this week been
of a decidedly slow, uninteresting kind. There
was an abundance of more or less favorable
developments. Including news that the British
force in Natal had obtained further advan
tages and that the London stock market had
on this Intelligence ehown marked relief from
the recent tension to which It was subjected,
though the effect of this was negatived by the
unfavorably news which came out on Friday.
There was some buying of our stocks for Lon
don on Thursday, but this failed to rouse the
sluggish spirit of the market. The real feat
ure of the week has been the continued Indis
position of the public to enter upon new specu
lative ventures and the subsequent absence Of
commission-house business of that nature. It
may be noted that the demand for bonds Is
quite fair. In some cases higher figures have
been made for favorite issues, and It Is also
noted that the buying power In the bond list
has* extended to the new and low-priced vari
eties, while, in view of the advanced figures
for and Email Income In yield upon gilt-edge
bonds, private Investors show a disposition to
take in their stead some of the safe dividend
paying stocks. Speculative attention was mainly
confined to the traction group of securities,
owing to Incidents which Â«?eem to point to a
combine under one control of the gas and
street railway facilities In Greater Now York,
or at least the boroughs of Manhattan and
Brooklyn.
The railroad share list was neglected. In
spite of good earnings by nearly every road
which has reported for the first three weeks of
January. The Granger stocks were also helped
by favorable opinions from the West about the
grain crop outlook.
In the Industrial group the reports of possible
labor troubles failed to have much effect, and
expectations about good dividends on the com
mon shares of the steel companies were again
current. All of these Incidents, or possible de
velopment*, failed, however, to develop any
buying power calculated to gl\-e the market an
appearance of life, and the, renewed ease of
money reemn simply to render holders of stocks
tenacious as to parting with them at the pres
ent rate of values.
The unexpected news on Friday morning that
the British forces In South Africa had lost the
position they captured from the Boers, with
the sharp break in consols and all classes of
stock at London, resulted in declines of a point
or iess throughout the active share list at New
York. There was. however, no extensive liquid
ation, and foreigners were the chief seller*. At
the decline shorts covered, and the market,
under somewhat discouraging circumstances,
Ehowed an appreciable degree of firmness.

NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â Improvement In the

S^w York Wheat Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 28.â Speculation !n wheat
was unusually active to-day, the. bulls obtain
ing a grip on the market that resulted in lUc
advance. An advance of 34c a bushel in Paris
wheat, attended by confirmation of crop dam
age rumors, brought on heavy covering by
local Interests and considerable Investment
buying likewise. In addition to this strong
news the market was influenced by reports
that Rosarlo. in the Argentine, had been closed
by the plague. May wheat in this market,
after opening strong at 73% c, sold up In the
last hour to 74Tic and closed nervous at 73% c.
It was, In fact, the biggest day that bulls
have seen In months and sentiment was cor
respondingly buoyant.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL AND FINACIAL NEWS
bonic plague caused heavy purchasing by
shorts. The cold weather without snow was
also a consideration. May advanced to 684 c.
at which It closed, 4c over yesterday. During
the last- hours business was animated. -Com-,
mission houses ' bought heavily for foreign In
terests.
Â¦Country offerings of corn became freer, giv
ing the market a tone of easiness bordering
on weakness. May closed a shade under yes
terday at 33V4Â©33Uc
The oats market, quiet early and disposed
to be easy, became more active later and in
fluenced by the strength of wheat turned firm.
May closed at the top, 4c over yesterday.
The provision market was strong and higher
In spite of the liquidation by interests which
until to-day were buyers. May pork closed
74c over yesterday; May lard 24@5c up, and
May ribs 74c better.
The leading futures ranged as follows: -
week, and the same Is true of. sugars, which
are active in Jobbing lines. A fractional ad
vance in refined sugars is to be noted and raws
retain all their old strength. The egg market
has been considerably relieved by large ex
ports of stored sorts. '
The iron trade is in a very Interesting con
dition Just at present. Buyers and â¢ sellers Â¦ are
etlll apart, uncertainty as to the continuance
of present conditions constituting a bar to new
business. Steel is reported by large Interests
as in good demand and some considerable sales
of rails and of structural material are re
ported. Some Improvement in export demand
is also noted, the question of ocean freights
being an important one In this connection.
Other metals remain fairly steady. The hard
ware business is of satisfactory proportions for
this season of the year. The open season is
having some effect upon coal prices, which are
reported easier at Philadelphia. The cereal
markets have shown little decided movement
this week, stronger cables, based partly on
damage to French and Russian crops and partly
on report of plague in the Argentine, furnish
ing a slight strengthening force to wheat prices,
offsetting further Increase in domestic stocks.
Corn has remained In good demand on liberal
export business and prices remain steady.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.551.197 bushels, against 3,061.
126 bushels last week, 4,997,562 bushels In the
corresponding vvt-t-k of 1899 5.026.024 bushels In

Since July 1 this season the exports of wheat
aggregate 117,385,528 bushels, against 144,232,241
bushels last year and 146,694,998 bushels In 1597

NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â R. G. Dun & Co.'Â« Re
view of Trade to-morrow will say:
No news Is always good news. New business
for manufacturers this year has been light In
some branches and much below the production
last month. It Is, perhaps, too often forgotten
that the industries start this year with larger
contracts ahead i than ever before; and when
half the work of the whole year has been or
dered in advance there cannot continue quite
the same activity In new buying. The woolen
manufacturer has Just opened a new season
with the largest transactions ever known In a
single week, it is eald, but In most other lines
contracts previously booked would make simi
lar activity impossible. Tet there is . seen
enough of hesitation caused by advanced prices
to make inactivity trying. Distribution to con
sumers throughout the country is rapid and
large, especially In quarters where It has been
feared that retailers were overbuying, bo that
there ia strong confidence in the future.
. It could not be expected that business would
adjust itself without any embarrassment to
any such a rise of prices as has occurred.
Early in December wool rose too high for prices
then obtainable for woolen goods, and weeks
of dullness followed. The boot and shoe manu
facturers are receiving small orders, as Jobbers
pay the prices asked only for such limited sup
plies as are needed for sorting; but their ur
gency to receive goods heretofore ordered is
mJtrked, and shipments from Boston have been
380,963 cases In four Â¦ weeks, about 4 per cent
more than in 1898 and 16 per cent more than in
IS9S, with greater increase over every other
year. Leather is Inactive and slightly weaker,
in spite of heavy exports, and hides are yield-
Ing at Chicago with accumulation of stock. s
Iron and steel prices have been yielding for
6everal weeks, and are a shade lower for prod
ucts than at any other time since the middle of
September, though Bessemer pig and billets
are still bo scarce and firmly held that only
two sales amounting to 8000 tons are anywhere
reported. Agreements to hold the price of bars
do not prevent sales at Philadelphia for $2,074
of Iron considered by buyers best refined, ac
cording to the Iron Age. Sellers call it com
mon, and plates and sheets are both irregular
there, with narrow plates sold at Plttaburg be
low {2.25. Structural shapes are not quoted
lower, but the New York Central contract for
13,000 tons of bridge material went to Pennsyl
vania, Penyod and Detroit works, and two or
ders for 25,000 tons of rails are taken at Chi
cago. Last year 13,620,703 tons of pig were pro
duced, according to the official record, the con
sumption being 13,374,277 tons. In minor metals
tin only has been active, January options being
quoted at 274 cents.
Wheat has advanced to 75% cents, with no
clear reason for such a sharp advance. Re
ceipts are small, in four weeks only 10.954.92S
bushels, against 17,200,297 last year; but the
Atlantic exports have been only 7,737.474 bush
els, flour included, against 11,037,383 last year.
Pacific exporls show a little gain, amounting
to 3,311,236 bushels for the same four weeks,
against 2.175,243 last year; but this Is of no aid
to Atlantic markets. Exports of corn still show
that American food Is wanted abroad, having
been in four weeks 13,482.792 bushels, against
12,370,564 last year. Nevertheless the price of
cash corn has declined about % of a cent, al
though option prices are about the same as at
the close last week.
Failures for the week have been 231 In the
United States, against 224 last year, and S3 in
Canada, acalnst 33 last yeaj.
New York Grain and Produce.
LONDON. Jan. 86.â The first s*rieÂ« of the
colonial wool sales for this year closed to
day. The offerings to-day numbered 13.154
bales and consisted of rather fair catalogues.
Competition In merinos was good, especially the
Continent. New Zealand crossbreds were In
active demand and were taken by the home
trade at full rates. Good lines of scoured
stock were taken by the American representa
tives. During the series there were many with
drawals. The home trade purchased 47.000
bales, the Continent 36,000 bales and America
4000 bales. There were 57,000 bales carried over.
After the strength of the last series and en
couraging trade conditions and short supplies
another rise was generally expected at the
opening of the present series. But Instead
the sales opened with hesitation on the part
of buyers. Minor crossbreds sold par to 5 per
cent, but s<jpn eased off to 74 to 10 per cent
below the December series. This weakness
was due to the dear money conditions and the
unsettled political conditions In South Africa.
The Continental buyers were rather cautious
at first and the home trade was quiet In their
speculations owing to the healthy trade re
ports. Later operators became more conn
dent, especially the Continental and American
buyers, and as. a result prices advanced consid
erably, particularly for coarse and medium
crossbreds and fine creasy merinos. The clos
ing: tone of the series was steady at about De
cember rates and occasionally 5 per cent
hlÃher. . Cape of Good Hope, and Natal wools
were neglected and largely withdrawn.

CAME TOO LATE WITH
HABEAS CORPUS WRIT
LITTLE LEW LIN GIN GOT OFF
Oil THE CHINA.
Attorney D. K. McKinlay appeared In
the United States District Court yester
day afternoon and asked to have the
passenger agent of the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company cited for contempt
for having disobeyed the writ of habeas
corpus issued by Judge de Haven requir
ing the immediate production of Lew Lin
Gin. a Chinese boy of the nge of four and
a half years, alleged to have been secret
ed on the steamer China.
The boy's parents are Chinese residents
of this city. He arrived from China
about a year ago and was denied a land
ing by the Collector. He was placed in
the Chinese Presbyterian Mission Home
for safe keeping and, all his legal rights
having been exhausted, he was placed on
board the steamship China for deporta
tion. The writ of habeas corpus was
served by a Deputy I'nited States Mar
shal on A. G. D. Kerrell, passenger agent
of the Pacific Mall Company, who made
the following return on the back of the
writ:
'This writ was received by me at the
dock at 12:55 p. m. yesterday, five min
utes before the appointed hour of sailing
of the China, on which vessel this boy
was supposed to be. Upon receiving the
within writ careful and diligent search
was made on the ship by the company's
agent, but no response was made to re
peated calls of his name in the place
where Chinese passengers congregate. In
view of the failure to locate him I am
unable to produce the body of the with
in named.'
Judge de Haven declined to take any
further proceedings in the matter unless
upon affidavit and Mr. McKinlay retired
to obtain the necessary papers.

WORKING FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF OAKLAND.
FOR A WEEK HIS
MEMORY PROVED
A TOTAL BLANK
Thought He Had Been
Vivisected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
For the past five days Frank Finley's
identity has been lost to himself; his
memory has been a blank, and during tha
interim he has been suffering most hor
rifying hallucinations as the result of a
sunstroke on the battle-fields of Cuba.
Finley was arrested for insanity last
Tuesday night. He had wildly rushed inta
a shoestore at Eighth and Clay streets,
and, crouching behind a counter, shouted
that he was being pursued by men with
guns. He was piaced In the Insane ward
at the Receiving Hospital. It is apparent
he did not know even his name. He gave
the names of Frank Rylands and Frank
Kenney, and said he lived in Hoboken.
Had he been examined by the Lunacy
Commissioners yesterday undoubtedly he
would have been sent to a madhouse, but
there was an unusual delay in his case
owing to the difficulty of learning any
thing about his antecedents. To-day he
experienced a lucid period; his reason and
memory returned n> him as suddenly a*
they had temporarily vanished.
"I came over to Oakland last Monday."
said Finley this afternoon, "to go to work
at Pinole. I was walking along a street
when suddenly I realized that I had lost
my blankets and bundle of clothing. I
couldn't remember what I had done with
these, nor could I remember anything
else. I forgot that I was bent on going
to Pinole, but I imagined that I had been
placed In the City Prison and shot
through the head, the bullet coming out
at my chin. An operation was performed
and new skin was grafted on the bullet
wound. Then I thought I was removed to
some other place, where a doctor cut me
In a thousand pieces, even slicing my eye
balls and my heart. Oh. the pain I suf
fered was something terrible. Death
finally relieved me, and I remained dead
for a week. I was surprised when I
awoke this morning to find myself In this
place, without pain and uninjured."
Drs. Buteau anil Blood, who acted as*
Lunacy Commissioners, promptly dis
charged the young man, though marvel-
Ing at his strange experience.
Finley was a cavalryman during the bat
tle near Santiago, over a year and a half
ago, and while fighting for t'nele Sam
suffered a sunstroke, to which he attri
butes his strange experience of this week.
He resides on Howard street, near

THE organization of the citizens' bond committee last
evening Is the most important move that has been
made for the advancement of bondo since that sub
ject was advanced by Mayor Snow in his first mes
sage to the City Council nearly a year ago. That this
should be a voluntary organization lends additional value
to it, for it then becomes an unselfish and a non-political
movement. That there is plenty of earnest intent among
the members is shown by the large attendance at the first
meeting, fully three-quarters of those invited being pres
ent.
The committee accomplished a great deal for Its first
meeting. It not only elected officers but launched Its work
and adopted full plans of procedure. All that is now being
waited for !fs the announcement of the executive commit
tee and the working sub-committees. These appointments
are in the hands of Chairman Warren Olney, who asked
that a little time be given him to study the list of members
of the general committee.
The officers are men of weight in Oikland. Warren
Olney is an attorney and a resident of the Second Ward.
First Vice President John A. Britton Is the general man-
ager of the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Company, and
has long been connected with propositions for the advance
ment cf Oakland. Second Vice President J. S. Wixon lives
in North Oakland, where he is a prominent merchant.
Third Vice President A. Schilling is a San Francisco mer
chant and a resident of the Fifth Ward, in which he has
taken much interest. D. Edward Collins is tho president
of tho California Bank, and has been connected with many
affairs for Oakland's betterment. Secretary H. F. Gordon
is a prominent insurance man.
The plan of campaign that Is to be carried out is a very
practical one. Sub-committees will be appointed to con
sider each separate proposition Â»hat is to be submitted to
the people. These committees will consult with engineers,
architects, contractors and men with Ideas upon their par
ticular branch of the bond issue. They will gather data,
figures and information from all sources, and will then
present their reports to the general committee. When
tliis is done the general committee will present Its recom
mendations to the City Council, and that body will be
asked to pass upon them.
Â¦ The executive committee will pass upon all new mat
ters that may come before the general committee.

. It van on the similarity between the

corks and huzzas.

WRIGHT MAY GO
TO SACRAMENTO
ON A STRETCHER
Assemblyman Struck
by a Car.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 26.
Howard E. Wright, Assemblyman from
the Fifty-flrst Assembly District, was
struck by an electric car near the corner
of Fifteenth street and Broadway this
morning and so badly injured that he
may not be able to go to Sacramento to
attend the extra session of the Legisla
ture. His injuries are very serious and
the extent will not develop for some time.
Mr. Wright rode from his residence on
Linda Vista terrace into Oakland this
morning and dismounted from his car in
front of the Central Bank building. He
started to walk toward the sidewalk,
when he noticed Assemblyman Joseph
Kelly of the Forty-eighth District stand
ing across the street. Kelly shouted to
Wright, who turned around, waved his
hand in reply and started to retrace his
steps across the street to join Kelly.
In so doing Wright did not notice an
other car approaching, and as he passed
behind the car from which ho had just
alighted he stepped in front of the other
car and was knocked down. He was taken
into a neighboring drugstore and after
ward removed to the Receiving Hospital,
where he was treated by Drs. W. S. Por
ter, R. T. Stratton and Charles Rowe.
Mr. Wright's hip was dislocated and
probably fractured, and it Is thought that
ther* Is an injury to his spine.
Assemblyman Kelly notified Mr?.
Wright, who went at once to the hospital
to attend her husband.
While the injuries of Mr. Wright are un
certain, it is very certain that he will not
be able to go to Sacramento unless he is
carried on a stretcher. Such a move Is in
contemplation if it is possible to move Mr.
Wright, because his vote may be very
necessary on the Senatorial situation.
Mr. Wright was the Speaker of the last
Assembly who resigned when the ex-
Eosure came of his relations with Milton
. Greon, the manager of the Grant cam
paign, from whom he secured Jl6OO, after
which he changed his vote from Grant
to Burns.

FLAMERO A
MAIDEN WITH
SOME SPEED
About the Warmest Thing o'
the Day at Oakland.
Cormorant Scores*
Don Cameron carved a large ripe water
melon at Oakland track yester
day with a maiden named Flam
ero. The Calgary turfman has
turned many a coup on different oc
casions with flying May W, and his name
is a synonym for "uncorking." Flamero
is a gelding by Flambeau, and his name
kept the wires to different Eastern pool
rooms broilng hot, it is Bald. When some
of the more Intrepid pencllers chalked up
10 to 1 they were nearly knocked off the
block, until 8 to 5 was about the price
at which most people got aboard. Tim
Tdolin cut out the work for quite a piece,
when Jenkins shook Flamero up and tak
ing the lead won easily. The ring did not
suffer to any great extent, as the maiden
had been too highly touted, and, figura
tively speaking, "the books were on." The
out-of-town poolrooms probably did not
fare so well.
Three favorites, a second choice and two
outsiders captured purses. Perseus, which
won at odds of 30 to 1, was allowed to run
loose by his stable. Jenkins and Bullman
divided the riding honors, each piloting
two winners.
In a hurricane four-head finish on the
winning post Scotch Plaid, Merops, Op
ponent and Wyoming passed the judges
in the order named at the conclusion of
the mile and a sixteenth selling run.
Clem Jenkins sat on the winner, which
closed a 6 to 5 choice, and a furlong from
Â¦the stand his chances were problematical.
The last fifty yards the gelding fairly
flew, just snatching victory in one of the
prettiest drives of the season. Merops
received strong support at odds of 4 to 1,
which long price was probably laid be
cause little Phelan had the mount.
Cormorant, owned by Sam Parker, the
Hawaiian turfman, and ridden by Piggott,
was first over the line in the second event,
at odds of 15 to 1. Getting away last of
his field, he soon showed second, and out
gaming St. Cuthbert, the favorite, got the
verdict by a neck. His owner made quite
a cleanup over the gelding's win.
Leading all the way, Perseus stood a
drive in the mile selling run, and beat
Stuttgart, the favorite, a nose at the fin
ish. The latter would have won but for
being interfered with on one or two oc
casions.
Mldlove enjoyed an easy victory in the
five furlong run. Alto 2 chance, she was
never headed, the place falling to Lady
Heloise, a 40 to 1 shot.
Once more Sly gained a decision over
Afamada, and if she accomplishes the
feat again it will be generally con
ceded that Hanlon's mare has the "Indian
sign" on the Easterner. Afamada enjoyed
first call in the ring, with 4 to 1 against
Sly. Bullman, astride the latter, beat
his field away, and in a long drive, won
by a head in 1:13 flat. Ben Ledi ran third.
CRACK HORSES WILL
SPORT SILK TO-DAY
Bannockburn, the Record Holder,
Among the Starters for the
Rich Lissak Stake.
The rich Lissak handicap, one of the
classic events of the track across the
bay, is down for decision this afternoon.
The distance Is one mile ar.d in caliber the
field quite equals that which lined up for
the Turf Congress stake, on which occa
sion the coast record was shattered.
Geyser will be an absentee, but Ban
nockburn, Tlmemaker, Yellowtail. Dr.
Sheppard, David Tenny, Rosormonde,
Flamora, Formero, F. W. Brode, Dr.
Xembula and Ventoro are an ensemble of
horseflesh which would attract a world
of attention on any track in the country.
In fact, it would be difficult to gather to
gether a greater collection of speed, and
It would not be surprising If the record
should be equaled if not lowered.
Bannockburn is asked to carry 12S
pounds, but he Is a wonderful weight
packer, as shown when he made the coast
record. Yellowtail recently ran a re
markable seven furlongs with big weight
up and to-day with weight off may stay
the route. Timemaker is never beaten
until the wire Is reached, and Dr. Nem
bula looks to have a royal chance with
101 pounds up. The Burns & Waterhouse
pair, David Tenny and Dr. Sheppard,
have both displayed rare form of late
and will have a host of followers. The big
event is fourth on the card.
Frank Doss was again on hand to give
Sly a "boost." Entered to be sold for
$500, Doss made one bid of it, saying $1200.
Dan Hanlon retained the mare with an
additional ?5.
Bullman finished on Mldlove with one
stirrup, the other being broken during
the progress of the race. Bullman is
riding like a demon to maintain his lead
in the riding contest, and now has a host
of followers. The score now stands;

of the city government and is holding
daily meetings with the numerous heads
of departments in order to obtain gen
eral information and details of the work.
The commission proposes also to inspect
the work now being done in the different
offices and will meet each afternoon at S
o'clock for the purpose of general discus
sion.
THE significance of the vote of the commission finding F. L. Esola not guilty of the specific charges
preferred by Fremont Older seems to have been misunderstood. My understanding of the situa
tion is this: By "specific" charges we meant the charges affecting his moral character, to wit, the
charges of robbery and larceny. We did not mean to pass upon the general charges of incompe
tency to fill the position of Chief of Police. We certainly did not mean to decide that Esola was competent
to fill the position. That the public may understand the exact facts I will make this brief statement of
what occurred:
The investigation was completed last Saturday night. We then adjourned till Tuesday last. At that
meeting Commissioner Thomas presented a written decision exonerating Esola from the charges filed by
Older. Commissioner McNutt was willing to agree to it. Commissioner Newhall and I positively refused.
We then adjourned till Wednesday afternoon. All parties remained unchanged. Mr. Newhall had pre
pared a separate decision for himself. I had one of my own. Messrs. Thomas and McNutt adhered to
theirs. We discussed them all without reaching an agreement or even taking a vote. We then adjourned
till yesterday, Thursday, afternoon, with the understanding that if we could not come to an agreement
we would respectively file our decisions and make them public. At our meeting yesterday we finally
reached a compromise. It was clearly understood that if I would join in a verdict of "not guilty" on
the charges affecting Esola's moral character his candidacy for the position was out of the question.
It was on that understanding that the verdict of "not guilty" was signed by me. It would never have
been agreed to otherwise. Ido not think Esola can possibly be elected Chief. I certainly shall never vote
for him. The other Commissioners can speak for themselves. While I was willing \o find Esola not
guilty on the charges of robbery, larceny, etc., because of the doubtful and disreputable character of the
evidence upon that subject, I could not decide that he was competent to fill the position of Chief of Police
and the commission did not so decide. On the contrary, at that meeting we then passed his name and
considered other applications, but found none of the candidates available, and we adjourned with the un
derstanding that we would look for a new man. On account of the wrong inferences that have been
drawn from the action of the commission I deem it necessary to make public my original decision in
this case. I would hav.e refrained from doing so were it not necessary in justice to myself. It was as
follows:
OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF POLICE COMMISSIONERS,
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FIIANCISCO, STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
This lnf-estlsratlon Teas held Â»linpl>- to determine whether or not Frederick L. Eaoln, nlio has
made v. written application for the position of Chief of Police, possesses the qualifications required
for the office.
We are not called upon to decide specifically In detail npon the truth or falsity of all or any of
the charses made by Fremont Older with respect to his conduct as a youth, or as a man, or as a
police officer. In short, this Is not a criminal trial In which we have to render a verdict of guiltj'
or not Kullt>- agralnst the accused.
We are charged with the duty of electing: an able and upright Chief of Police. When we have
satisfied ourselves that any particular applicant for the position docs not come up to that standard
we should dismiss him from consideration.
Wo are not here to decide newspaper controversies nor action of alleged libel. There are
courts where redress can be had by the parties who claim to be Injured. In this view, it is not
necessary for me to say anything further than that Frederick L. Esola docs not, in my opinion, pos
sess the requisite qualifications to I>ll the position of Chief of Police, and I, therefore, do not look
upon hint as an available candidate.
From a consideration of his record as a police oJHcer and of his educational qualifications,
and from my own personal observation of his mental abilities, I am satisfied he docs not come up
to the standard of a competent Chief of Police for this city.
With regard to his character as n boy or as a man before he Joined the force, it is not neces
sary for me to aay anything, and upon thut ground I say nothing. I deem It my duty, however, to
say that his conduct and demeanor npon the stand in this investigation made an unfavorable im
presnlon upon me. When he testified that he could not recollect meeting the members of this com
iniNsion in company with Mr. Lawrence and Mayor Phelan in the Mayor's office at the New City Hall
on January 7, 1000, and repeatedly affirmed his entire loss of memory with regard to that meeting
held only two weeks previously he showed, to put it in the mildest manner possible, that his mem
ory was so very frail that he simply is not competent to be Chief of Police. This testimony was not
an oversight. It was deliberate and repeuted. It either was not the truth under oath or it showed a
memory weak to the extent of mental incompetency.
I desire to be understood as not expressing any opinion on the guilt or innocence of Lieutenant
Esola npon the charge* filed by Fremont Older. I simply decide that I do not deem his qualifica
tions sufficient to entitle him to be considered in the choice of a Chief of Police of New San Fran

Still to Patch* His
Tattered Reputation

ment of His Secre

Sullivan Jr.
Learning these facts, representatives of
this morning newspaper went to Captain

he would be denounced this morning In
the most approved style known to the
newspaper world of which this particular
paper Is a glaring example. Captain

CALLUNDAN RESIGNS
FROM THE FORCE.
One of the most deeply significant Inci
dents of the meeting of the Police Com
missioners last night was the presentation
and Immediate acceptance of the resigna
tion of Jules J. Cullundan, alias Worth
lngton, as a member of the Police Depart
ment. Nothing could have shown more
clearly than this the existence of a gi
gantic conspiracy to make Esola Chief
of Police and Callundan Chief of Detec
tives. As The Call charged, Callundan
was smuggled Into the department for the
single purpose of being elevated to the
post of Chief of Detectives. He was In
eligible and unfit and The Call, in obedi
ence to its responsibility to the public,
exposed him as he is.
His private character and deficiencies
became objects of legitimate criticism
and censure, since he sought to place him
self in a position where he would become
a menace to the moral health of the city.
He was smuggled into the department at
one of the last meetings of the old com
mission, giving up a private income to
accept a smaller public one in order that
his plot with Esola and the men behind
him might succeed. It was never Callun
dan's purpose to become an ordinary pa
trolman, and after being admitted to the
department he asked and received ten
days' time in which to qualify for his new
position, giving as an excuse that he
wished to wind up his private affairs.
The excuse was simply a subterfuge by
which Callundan hoped to delay his ac
ceptance of ordinary police duty until the
election of Frederick L. Esola as Chief of
Police, when the private detective of
Harry N. Morse would become the Chief
of Detectives of this city through the ap
pointment of Esola and the indorsement
of the arch-conspirators of the scheme.
The 4 ten days allowed Callundan by the
commission expired yesterday and he was
ordered to report for duty to one of the
police captains. He saw that the shame
ful conspiracy to seize the Police Depart
ment of this city and make of it an
agency of crime had utterly failed; that
Esola and his unscrupulous backers had
lost their battle to make the Police De
partment of this city a commodity for
purchase and sale to the criminals of San
Francisco. Callundan had therefore no
further use for the Police Deparimcnt
and no desire to serve as a member of it
In the capacity of a patrolman.
The Call's expose of the wretched plans
of his supporters had made him an Impos
sibility as a public official. He strove, un
der the inspiration of a lingering hope, to
secure an additional delay of a week, but
this was emphatically denied to him, and
last night he sent to the Commissioners
his star, pinned to his resignation. Both
were accepted with alacrity, and one epi
sode in an Indecent spectacle was con
cluded. Had not Callundan attempted
without shame to force himself intÂ« a
public position of responsibility and trust
The Call would not have discussed his
odorous character und past history. Since
he has retired with commendable haste to
private life his character ceases to be a
matter of public Interest and Is dis
missed.
This action of Callundan in retiring so

fJJ) be, HE meeting of the Police Com
/*" m mission last rJght was the
Â£j most sensational in the short
/S/jy history of the new governing
\&r body of the Police Department
of this city. The CommiEslon
ers met with the humiliating knowl
edge that their compromise report
In reference to Frederick L. Esola had
been deliberately ar.d maliciously twisted
from its true meaning and mendaciously
misconstrued by the morning newspaper
â¢which Is supporting the absurd claim of
the ambitious lieutenant. The Commis
sioners felt, at least two of them, that
they had been placed In a false position
before the people and that the crafty and
unscrupulous backers of Esola were
trifling with their honor in this matter of
vital Importance.
The meeting was in a way a stormy one,
but the Commissioners were not long In
session before three or four points of Im
portance were firmly established. The
first of these, from which no pettifogging
lawyer or unscrupulous advocate can
escape. Is that Frederick Lawrence Esola
Is unequivocally out of the race for the
position of Chief of Police of this city.
More than that, his sponsor in the com
mission Itself promised that if he were
given a little more time he would secure
Esola's public withdrawal from the race.
The Commissioners to whom he appealed
and who felt the stir.g of an injustice that
reflects upon their personal honor refused
to grant the request and one of them In
sisted upon his absolute right to place
himself upon record before the people of
San Francisco and to explain in detail and
Â¦without equivocation the steps that cul
minated in placing Esola In the position
of being absolutely Ineligible for the po
eition he sought and being altogether out
of the question as a candidate.
Another important poir.t developed and
established at the meetirg last night Is in
the highest degree discreditable to the
Mayor of this city, who still refuses to at
tend to h!s own business and permit the
Police Commissioners to transact those
affairs which they have a right by virtue
of their office to discuss. The Mayor
apain appeared before the commission and
begged from its members another con
cession. He afked themâ and his asking
had almost the arrogance of a demand
that if they could not compromise their
honor so far as to elect Esola Chief of Po
lice, would they appoint his secretary,
Co'.onel William P. Sullivan Jr., to the
position? The Mayor made this request
with an idea that It will perhaps serve.
If it be granted, to patch some of the
holes in his tattered political reputation.
The Commissioners reached no conclu
sion in reference to the Mayor's demand,
but it is understood that they look favor
ably upon it, and Colonel Sullivan now
has the most probable chance of any can
didate to be elected Chief of Police when
the commission meets again next Monday
right. When the commission met last
night the situation was a simple one. The
compromise report had been signed and in
the siprnlng of it the Commissioners had
removed Esola as an aspirant for Chief
of Polic.
Th<> claims of Police Captain George W.
Wittman. Robert Hogan and Charles
Holbrook had been discussed and rejected.
The commission had no candidate before
It. and the understanding was that the
meeting was to open with a discussion of
any man who mipht prove available.
While the meeting was an executive one.
Its incidents were of such a sensational
character that they inevitably became
public property before the night was over.
At the beginning of the meeting Commit-
Â»lor.er Biggy, it is understood, insisted to
the other Commissioners and to Mayor
phelan. who persisted In remaining prey.
Â«rt, that the morning newspaper wh J ch
lias taken upon ltsc'f the burden of foist
ing Esola upon the city had deliberately
misconstrued the meaning of the ccm-
"I want some whiskey, and I want It bad";
they didn't give him JeuÂ« Moor*.

The friends, political and other, of Tax

petitions are being circulated throughout
the city setting forth the litigation which
Mr. Scott's office Is tied up in, and also
the fact that It will take months before
any decision can be had. It carries an
appeal to the Mayor to exercise his right
and quiet the title to the office and end
the expense of legal proceedings by up
pointing Scott regularly to the place. The
petitions are being generally signed, and
Mr. Scott's managers are confident that
the Mayor will do the right thing.

VENTURA, Jan. 26.â Oliver Somers,
aged 30 years, committed suicide this
evening in the Missouri Saloon, owned by
Sam Craig, a brother-in-law. Somers was
the county oil distributor for the Standard
Oil Company. He returned about 5
o'clock from Oxnard, when his team was
slate for United States Senator. Gage,
having invited the help of Herrin and
Jack Wright, ought to, for consistency's
sake, court the favor of Jlmmie Phelanâ
the late Hon. James D. Phelan of Demo
cratic renown. .
The clean, straightforward Republicans
who refuse allegiance to Burns and Her
rin have practically resolved not to com
mit themselves to any caucus scheme
until they have had full conference on
the subject. While the question is pend
ing, suggestions may come from Thomas
R. Bard, John A. Barnham, Irving M.
Scott, General Barnes and U. 8. Grant Jr.
The Southern Pacific has already begun
Its tactics of despicable Intimidation. A
member of the Legislature who supplies
the corporation a certain commodity was
advised yesterday that the business
would be taken from him if he did not
vote for Burns. The legislator replied:
"I may lose the trade you speak of by
voting against Burns, but I would lose a
great deal more than the value of the
business by voting for him. I will not
vote for him."
The facts In this particular case of at
tempted intimidation ought to be obtained
by the Legislature and presented to D. O.
Mills and John W. Mackey, who were re
cently elected directors of the Southern
Pacific. If these gentlemen knew the
naked truth of this incident of despicable
bulldozing they would resign from the
directory or bounce Herrin out of the yel
low building. The company cannot gain
the good will of the California public
while such methods as Herrin counte
nances are tolerated by the management.

GOV. GAGE AGAIN IN TOWN
SECRET CONFERENCE WITH D.M
BURNS AND HERRIN.
Several members of the Legislature
from the Interior arrived In the city yes
terday and many more will come to-day.
Among those In town last evening were:
Senators S. C. Smith of Bakersfield, John
F. Davis of Jackson. W. F. Maggard of
Corning, Thomas Flint of San Juan, As
semblymen F. E. Dunlap of San Joaquin,
A. S. Mllice of Riverside and J. B. San
ford of Ukiah.
Governor Gage also arrived In town yes
terday from Sacramento and registered at
the Palace. It was common talk around
the corridors of the hotel last night that
he was somewhere In conference with
Burns and Herrin. One of Burns' lieu
tenants looked at rooms In the Grand
Hotel yesterday and Inspected the ap
proaches to the bridge connecting the
Palace and Grand. Gage's movements to
conceal his conferences with Burns and
Herrin are ridiculous. He ought to have
common sense sufficient to know that the
people of the State are aware of his
antics and would laugh If the topic was
not one to awaken Just Indignation and
remonstrance.
Questions pertaining to the organiza
tion of the Legislature engage the atten
tion of Senators and Assemblymen. It is
an acknowledged Indisputable fact of rec
ord that the Legislature adjourned sine
die March 19. 1899, yet there are members
who contend that the forthcoming extra
ordinary session will be but a continue.
tion of the thirty-third regular session.
Should that position be maintained the
Controller would be justified In refusing
to sign warrants for the per diem of
members. The constitution, section 2, ar
ticle IV. declares: "No pay shall be al
lowed to members for a longer time than
sixty days, except for the first session
after the adoption of the constitution, for
which they may be allowed pay for 100
days."
Senators and Assemblymen who are
about to assemble In Sacramento will be
in no haste to take a position which will
give the Controller an opportunity to
sever the bond which connects the Legis
lature with the public treasury. To make
assurance of pay doubly sure the legis
lators will organize each house again.
The same old officers may be re-elected,
but the porters, watchmen, pages and
clerks will not be expected to rally around
the desk when the balloting for Senator
begins and render applause when some
misguided or unfortunate member makes
a sorry spectable of himself by voting for
Burns. Last winter the attaches, headed
by "Big" Smith, shouted themselves
hoarse when poor old Simpson betrayed
his constituents and espoused the cause
of the Mexican. Attaches of a higher
grade may be necessary for the extra
session.
There are perceptible signs of weakness
In the Burns camp. The knowledge that
the elements opposed to boss tactics and
railroad methods are bound to come to
gether in support of some good, clean can
didate produces the greatest apprehen
sion in Dan's corral. Herrln's game is
clearly disclosed. In fact, he is so vain
and clumsy that he cannot conceal his
movements. It Is now well known that
his play is to prevent a conference of the
fifty-five Republicans who stood forth in
manly fashion last winter to shield the
State from shame. He expects that these
Republicans will scatter and diffuse their
strength on three or four candidate until
the patience of the people is exhausted.
He says that his personal prestige is at
stake. The inference is that this so
called pestige will be lost when Burns is
beaten.
This kind of talk provokes derision In
the yellow building. Even Stubbs and
Mills are losing respect for the political
end of the law department. Herrin con
tinues to deny that he is a Democrat, as
serting that his last Democratic vote was
cast for Cleveland. The denial is vigor
ously made to shield Governor Gage from
the awkward predicament of consorting
with. Democrats to fix up a Republican
ELECTRICAL WORKS
DESTROYED BY FIRE
San Jose Improvement Company Suf
fers a Loss of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars,
SAN JOSE, Jan. 27.â The works of the
Electric Improvement Company, a few
blocks south of the narrow gauge depot
in this city, were destroyed by fire about
1 o'clock this morning. The blaze started
shortly after midnight from the burning
out of a large dynamo, and soon the build
ings were in flames in a number of places.
The works were entirely consumed.
A gas plant near by was saved. The
loss in buildings and machinery Is esti
mated at $100,00). The property was in
sured for $50,000. The plant has been es
tablished for about ten years. A laige
business was done and a great number
of business houses and residences in this
city are now deprived of electric lighting
facilities. The works will be rebuilt im
mediately. __Â¦
as he feels that in duty to himself and
in justice to the reputation he has won
in public life he cannot afford to place
himself in a false position or permit an
unscrupulous newspaper or a pettifog
ging attorney to place him in such a
position against his will. It was after
Commissioner Biggy declared his inten
tion to publish his report that Mayor Phe
lan asked, half In supplication and half
in demand, that Colonel William P. Sulli
van Jr. be elected Chief of Police if the
Commissioners did not feel that they
could consistently with their sense of de
cency elect Esola.
As already indicated, the Commission
ers seem favorably disposed to the May
or's request, and Colonel Sullivan has
thus taken first place In the list of avail
able candidates. In connection with the
desperate effort to elect Esola there- has
arisen an Interesting episode. A morning
newspaper which is frantically and hys
terically backing the young lieutenant
realized yesterday that all hope was gone
and that certain facts tended to show that
Police Captain Wittman had some chance
in the race. This newspaper had discov
ered that some of the active supporters
of Captain Wittman had held a meeting
a few days ago to suggest a way to secure
his election.
Commissioner McNutt had asked Cap
tain Wittman to take the position, but
the captain declined the honor, notwith
standing the fact he was promised the
votes of Commissioners Newhall and
Thomas. The captain tihied at the four
year term and said also that Commis
sioner Biggy seemed to have the right of
way. Commissioner McNutt assured him
that Mr. Biggy was not In the race, and
with thai assurance Captain Wittman
agreed to take the place
promise report which had been adopted
the night before.
This report. It will be remembered, ex
onerated Esola from the specific charges
preferred against him by an evening
newspaper, but the exoneration, the re
port declared, did not mean that the
board had reached any conclusion upon
the appointment of a Chief of Police.
Commissioner Biggy asked his associates
if. In signing that report, they un
derstood, as he understood, clearly and
without the slightest possible question
that the report was a concession to Fred
erick L. Esola, granted to him with the
distinct understanding that he withdraw
from the race for Chief of Police and that
after the report had been signed Esola
was in no way a subject for discussion by
the board.
Commissioner Xewhall replied that he
agreed thoroughly with Mr. Biggy in his
understanding of the meaning of the re
port and the motives that prompted the
signature. Commissioner Thomas took
the remarkable stand, suggesting, if
nothing else, the sharp practice "of a
pettifogging advocate, that he under
stood that Esola was removed from con
sideration simply because there was a
deadlock in the board in reference to the
lieutenant's competency. Commissioner
McNutt agreed with Mr. Thomas.
Commissioner Biggy was dumfounded.
He declared that if that were the csse he
had signed the report under an absolute
misunderstanding, and he did not intend
to remain longer in a false position, whicn
reflected upon his personal honor, be
fore the people of the city. He demanded
the right to make public his original re
port finding Esola Incompetent and in a
variety of ways ineligible for the position
of Chief of Police, and further than that
to detail the circumstances which attend,
ed the signing of a compromise report.
This report was signed simply as an
agreement between the commission and
Mayor Phelan, who promised that if the
commission would agree to clear Esola's
moral character from the accusation
which had been made against it Esola
would be withdrawn from the race for
the position of Chief of Police.
The compromise report meant this and
nothing more. It referred solely to the
specific charges which reflected upon the
moral character of Esola and said abso
lutely nothing about his incompetency.
At least two of the Commissioners who
signed the report understood positively
that the document certainly did not say
that Esola is competent to be a Chief of
Police, for the simple reason that two of
the Commissioners are thoroughly con
vinced that he is not competent. More
than this, these two Commissioners posi
tively declined to sign the report until
they were assured that it meant the
withdrawal of Esola as a candidate.
With that understanding the report was
signed. All of this Commissioner Blggy
insisted last night he had a right to pre
sent to the public. Commissioner Thomas,
fearful of the consequences, begged for
a little more time and promised if his re
quest were granted he would have Esola
publicly withdraw from the race. Com- !
missioner Biggy declined to grant the re
quest and Mayor Phelan asked him what
he intended to do and he told his Honor
that it was his purpose to publish his
original report and a recital of the in
cidents which led up to the signing of the
compromise report at once.
And Commissioner Biggy kept his word.
