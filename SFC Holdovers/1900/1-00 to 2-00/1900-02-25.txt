"Dot noo oatmeal I tell you for break

A girl entered tho room, nodded mo
rosely to three or four of the women and
stepped directly to the railing. She
watched the bidding for several minutes,
then went out again. I could see her
pale, gloomy face and her look of despair
after the door closed.

"What do you pay the brokers?"
"Ona dollar commislson for buying or

"One woman was telling me that ths
brokers and their friends maks all tha

"She must have been unlucky."
"And another was telling ma that lt'i

"She must stand In with some brokers."

There was a slight ripple around . him.

strutting toward me and giving a snort

now. But things Ml be better next week.
I'm goln' to make plenty more out o" this
before I get through."
. She reached a confidential and itubby
hand out from under her fur. Tha fur
was the nondescript kind that resembles
a stray cat's when dogs are within scent.
"Let me tell you." she said.
I grew mentally and bodily evasive, but
she came closer. Her eye 3 were like all
the eyes I saw In the room, beady and
glittering.
"There's a fortun* fur you. let ma tell
you that. Think of what I done, and I
no older than you when I started. And
just a few dollars was all I had. An' sea

make your fortun' soon. Think o* tha

Well. I'd like to know."
"One of the operators told me that this
Is usually a losing game."
"There! If you haven't been talkin* to
them women about investln'. after all I
warned you. Didn't I tell you soma of
'em 'ould say that? That one was foolish
or slow In buyln'. I s'pose. An' she most
likely was jealous of you for fear you'd
make somethin". That's the way they
are. Don't listen to them an* you' re. all
right."
The melancholy widow waited for me.
"Ol hope ye ain't a-goin' to sink non ay
yer money, ra'dearr," she said.
"I am not going to." I could answer her.
"Oi'm thankful fur that. Ol am. It's a

sorry doy fur you. too. that you gambled.
There's thlm as'll till ye dlfTrent. but
they ain't to be tru3ted. Oi had pllrity ay
good money whin Ol come here, but Oi
wanted more."
"So^vou lost what you had and gained
nothing?"
"Yes." she replied.
She left me and entered a broker's
office. Through the glas3 door I noticed
that some explanation was evidently de
manded of the broker, for his face was
conciliatory and his palms were upward.

"We ain't allowed over there. You could
go once or twice as a visitor an' sit in
the gallery, but after that they'd spot

wouldn't let you in. Wish I could go,

Back in the darkness of the corner and
of her fur collar was to be seen a cau
tious narrowing' of lids over gleaming
eyes. ,
At the other end of the row I talked
with the melancholy widow.
"This is a bad place, m' dear, a bad
place." she said. "It was a sorry day for

She pulled her long, greasy veil around
her and sank, pudgy, Into the. folds of It,
and wiped first one blinking eye and then
the other with , the corner . of the veil's
hem.
"Good-by," said I to the melancholy
widow.
"Good-by, an' don't listen to any ay the
women," Bald the melancholy widow to
roe.
There was some shifting of. position go
ing on. I moved 'to another- row.
A short-haired, ehort-sklrted woman
crossed the room and sat beside me." She
talked softly to her neighbor on the othar
side.
"Mrs. Dade's gettin* ver" scare." she
said.
"She's always gettln' scared," answered
the other. "But. she keeps on Just the
same. I've seen her aroun' -here ever
since I've been comln', and that's forty
four year in March." !
"Ja, but shehaf reason' to be scare dls
time. -She put" all her money* in ' "yon
mine, 'cause em fortune-teller tell her to,
an' now she get scare, 'cause dey say dot
mine ain't coin' to- pan out."
"Too bad, ain't It? She's a servant an'
she has to work awful hard, poor thins,
an* she don't get much pay. Her father
left her a little an' she came here an'
gambled, an' she made for a. while, un
til she had ??000, an' then she lost It alt
at once, an' now she ain't got nothln*.
Poor thing."
"She don't lose ef she puy an' den go
home. Dot's vot I tell her. Buy vot you
vant to puy, den go home an' don't listen
to nopody, I say. Kf you listen you nefer
know how to puy. an' you go bust. Don't
listen to none of de women, I say to her,
but she don't listen to me."
. "Then she done what you told her," put
In the neighbor. She was a putty-colored,
phlegmatic woman.
"No, she don't done vot I tell her. I
tell her, 'Don't listen to none of the
woman," an' she don't listen to me,"
came heatedly. The putty-colored one
smiled lazily and did not argue further.
There was a feeble flurry of excitement
In the pit. One broken shook another,
who was not of his own size.
An operator who had not yet joined the
others stepped to the rail to listen, and
1 folowed her.
"Do you have to keep track of every
thing so closely?" I asked her.
"All the time,'.' she answered. "There's
no use gambl'.n' at all if you don't watch.
.Some of 'em comes an' cots, but it ain't
no good that way. Them that makes a

.my puffy neighbor apologetically. "Some

ventures turned oul "disastrously. ~Tb9 ,
muchee bad." said Lum Chow; "all 11* I
go dead." And dead he. went, making
sure, that he did so by the double assur
ance of hanging and shooting. The de
spondent Celestial climbed a tree, tied a.
rope around the branch, adjusted the
other end about his neck and then shot
himself off his perch. He was as dead as
the proverbial doornail when they found;
him shortly afterward.
Insanity has Its victims., A number of
cases, according to the verdict on the
Coroner's books, were due to "temporary
aberration." One poor fellow, leaving his
â¢work on the city's cobblestones, took with
him a revolver and went out to the park,
where he shot himself through the head,
having' written a note with the words, "I
believe I am going Insane in my head.'*
The wobbling signature gave his name aÂ»
"A. King."
One of the unidentified scrawled on Â¦
rough piece of paper, "I am tired of UvÂ«i
Ing; it is all eft,' and sent a bullet through,
his head.
Some little boys were playing about lH
the park one spring day. In the intrica
cies of "hide-and-seek" two of them
crawled up under some bushes on a hill
side. While breathlessly waiting for a
chance to "run home," all alert for the
approach of the one who was "it." they
chanced to see a roughly shod foot stick-
Ing out of the shrubbery.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
THE" little honse imfier the graft"
was calling to Amy Murphy out
among the green trees In the park.
The dark branches were waving 1
and adding their whispers to the
call, so ehe killed herself.
Within thÂ« peet ten years there has
been over & thousand other* in the city
cf Ean Francisco who have. listened to the;
same oall and added an item to tbe long
I!st of Incidents of record on the Morgue
books. Gome of them have left messages,
others have ventured eflently, taking*
thtir sorrows and troubles with them and
depriving the busy public of a s!gh and
a comment. Some have been identified by
atxlous friends or grieving relatives;'
ethers have silently awaited the lapse of
allotted time upon the cold slabs of the
Morgue, unclaimed and ;mr<i!>coÂ«jnlr.e>l. anÂ«X
added arothei incident to the "unknown*
Hrt.
The tuJdfies of Ban Francisco chooMl
various places and various means of end"
lr.g their lives. Down where the water>
Â¦waahes restlessly around the wharves and
docks they wander about, wavering; then
the tlfi* bears a soulless burden awajj
â¢with the ebb.
Out at the ellS the wires run high anÂ£
the madness of the sea gets Into the)
heart and the brain of the troubled. Then
there is the plodding ferry boatâ a dashi
and a plur.ge end the careless crowd of *
moment ago !s tranflxed with horror, but
the bay is deep and curiosity is futile.
For these whose minds turn to poison* 1
and self-inflicted violence there are the
gloomy rooms of lodging-houses and the.
park.
The park, with its luxury of trees,
shrubbery and green gra*Â». eeems to ap
peal etrongly to the troubled philosopher
â¢who seeks to rid himself of what he
deems a burden. To the tesement-cro'trd
ed. overburdened suicide, it? playhouse
*nrt of world is a painful contrast. Along
the driveways there Is a <".ash of carriages
and the cay hoof-beatir.gr of pleasure
erekir.g eo.uestriars. end drifts of happy
lauphter float in from careless idlers. The
S^eam cf a bit of sunshine turned away
by the cold *teel of a client little weapon
supgesis a way to even up the balance.
Maybe it's an ugly little bottle, with a
ekull and crossbone? pasted upon it that
Is hidden away in the bosom of the brood
er ovÂ«Â»r his troubles: maybe it's a keen,
tharp knife. Â»ith a shining blade. What
ever It is it grows more precious to him
Kith the slant of the sun's rays, and
whfn the shadows hover around him
thick he gets the courage.
Of the eleven hundred and odd suicides
on the San Frcncisco records of the past
ten years. e!phty-seven have occurred in
Golden Gate Parkâ about one out of every
twelve.
Certain Thomson of the Park Police
keeps an official "accident" book and the
memoranda of suicides go down in it with
fiata of runaways, collisions and other
everyday occurrences.
The tragedy of Amy Murphy follows the
record cf other tragedies, and will be fol
lowed by those that are to come. There
are some remarkable cases on the list
vrlthSn the memory of Captain Thomson,
among them that of a poor, friendless
cM woman whose Ingenuity supplied a
rnear.s cf death when she found herself
penniless and unabl* to purchase an ln-
JhoieJrinorpTsrae as the means of ridding*
himself of this world's troubles.
In.ISD3 thefe was a pretty young girl
found lying with her white face turned;
to the skies. Her name was Ida R.iab.
and she had quarreled with the man shÂ»
loved. . She had wandered about the park
all afternoon, and when the hush of night
brought courage for the deed she swal
lowed the drops of poison that stilled thai
weary heart.
The list cf park suicides does not con
tain the names of many women. For
some reason the largest percentage of
women suicides is among the number
drowned in the bay.
Many of the suicides are not discovered
nntll too late for identification. It seem*
to be a common Instinct with them to
seek unfrequented and isolated spots.
Whether they go away into such places
to brood undisturbed over "their troubles
â¢r whether they fear to be interfered with
Is a matter of conjecture, but the fact of
their seeking out lonely and hidden place*
accounts for the large percentage of un
discovered and unrecognizable suicides.
An "unknown" old man was some years
ago found in a clump of shrubbery. The
blade cf a rusty old Jack-knife was stuck
through a rough, warped piece of card
board, on which there was a faint trac
ing of the words. "It ain't no use a l!vtn\*"
Just what trouble or sorrow had 'brought
the poor, despondent old can to that un
happy conclusion no one will ever know,
for he held his own counsel, and the rusty
old revolver beside him helped him to put
his philosophy into practice.
H Death is a thing of dread to the unpre
judiced. To the human contemplation It
Is a mystery and a fear, but there are
those to whom its mystery and its fear
seem less than the scourges that urgo
them on. Ean Francisco has had over a
thousand such within the past ten years.
Individual trouble and individual sorrow
has been ended by some eleven hundred

Among the victims of the popular cya

US and Jewelry In favor of tho undiscov
ered heirs. The suicide was found nea?
the main driveway with a bottle- of ths
poison In his hand, the money In his
pocket, a gold watch and chain and scm*
ring* of value. He was neatly dressed la
a array business suit and had an empty*
envelope In his pocket, which had passed
through the malls and from which a lot
ter had evidently been removed. It was
addressed to "Gustave J. Lamblot. San,
Franlcsco." No Inquiries were ever made,
and the stranger was burled unidentified)
In the city's plot.
? similar case was that of a suicide
found on one of the benches near the mu
sic stand. The name of the unfortunate,
as denoted by papers about his person,
was Ernest Mentzel of Denver. Colo.
When found he was dressed neatly, had
money In his pockets and wore a pold
watch, which was still running. His hands
were delicate and white and the fingers
tapering*. Nothing could be learned of him
And no communication was ever received
from friends or relatives. The reason for
his despondency, or whatever prompted
his death, he evidently preferred to keep
to himself. He left no message.
In the summer of 1597 a despondent dry
goods clerk poisoned himself near the lakÂ«
In Golden Gate Park, having become tired
of poverty and ill luck. His name waÂ«
John Hopkins, and statements previous to
his death disclosed his motives as being
prompted by a feeling of being "down on
his luck." A year after hla self-inflicted
death a relative In Illinois died, leavtnff
to the suicide a fortune of some thousands
of dollars. Inquiry as to the whereabouts
of the heir led to the dicovery of a brief
Item In the Coroner's book and a lunel/
grave In the city's burying ground.
In 1890 an old man was observed wan
dering about In the. park every day.
He would start and walk away guiltily
whenever an officer approached, and
seemed to be brooding over some trouble.
One day they found him dead, the result

done It myself. I am tired of living." ThÂ«

the idea. The breezes could blow and

an annual celebration, 'iruwing thousands
of farmers from the surioundlrig country.
That was only nine years ago,, but even

At. last California is to have a street
fair 'of its own, lasting from April 30
through the following Saturday. It will
differ, a bit frcm ' "ye olde Englishe
Fayre," but there is no doubt about, its
being a Â¦ lineal descendant.. The word
"fair" nowadays means an industrial ex
hibition with added amusement features.
The old fairs cf Europe were Immense
markets where- the products of all .the
world were' exhibited and edd. " Most of
the famous fajrs of medieval England
and Europe were grants from the sov
ereign to, abbots, bishops or other eccles
iastical dignitaries. The-first great Eng
lish fair is, said to have been the outcome
of an idea which popped Into the head
of. Carauseu3e. ' the ' rebel Emperor of
Britain. "This buying, is too troublesome
a business," he remarked one day m the
year 507 A. D. His eyebrows were tied
In a hard knot atop . of his nose, and
there 'were ditches: in his forehead.
"Bring me all the products of the world,'
he thundered. "Let me see them spread
out in * the 'highway that I may ride by
and inspect them. Slice an ear off
the" head of every farmer wno refuses to
bring h!s goods. to the fair."
, Then Carauseuse untied his eyebrows
and smiled- a blase smile at the thought
of what was In store for him.
The ilayor of Sacramento has been do
ing a similar act. "Bring forth your po
tatoes and pumpkins and fat babies." he
has thundered. "Let us see them' gathered
In the highway." Sacramento has several
highways, being a different style of town
from that ot ancient Britain,- and the
final choice is L streetâ that is. for the
merchants' booth. ..The .whole fair and
carnival will be spread over the streets
surrounding the Capitol building. Com
mencing on L street at Tenth the mer
chants' booths will -reach for five blocks
east and west and some will be on N
street. The space from L to. N on.Fif
teenth street will be utilized for band
stands and free exhibitions by vaudeville
performersâ not- the "step-up-ladies-and
senilemen-only-five-cents" . kind. but
really free bowery songs and ragtime
babies.' Whether it co's.ts more to get. out
of these attractive tents than to get *n
is not yet announced;
AtHhe bottom of oil the complex ar
rangements stands the executive commit
tee of the State Fair Club. They, have
been in communication with the Mayors
of Eastern cities where street, fairs have
been held In order to learn the newest
kinks, which are. in truth, nothing but the
oldest, for the greatest novelty , ,tnat a

of come ancient-and forgotten custom. I.

The falls at Folsom furnish Sacramento

are already laid. The first will be devoted
to the reception of visiting Elks.' Odd Fel

The carnival will be a combination of all
the Italian carnivals, the Ntfw Orleans

the Kansas City Priests of Pailas anl tl.o
California fiestas that ever flaunted their
glories and blew their own trumpets
through American streets. .It wil! be mad
and merry, and the prunes and Dtisms
people had better stay '. where they be

of southern festivals have been creeping
into American rejoicings 'for some cinie

cisco h^as felt the intoxication of lavle33
merriment â there was a taste of it last
summer at the volunteers* home-coming,
and the new year was furiously ushered
in. Sacramento will be no more reckless,
but far more splendid.
Confetti throwing will be imitated. You
will have a right to throw all the tardy
you like at anybody you like., and you
will have to be nice about all that i*
thrown back at you. There is a ro?e show

window above, and there Is nothing to be
seen but a flirt of a vanishing sown when
you look up, and nothing to be heard but
a laugh. From the next window you n'.ay
receive a shower of peanut shells, and
there will be only a glimpse and a laugh
behind them likewise.
The parade will be .at nisrnt. and will
carry along tts own daylight in the form
of Greek fire. Domino-clad figures will
march beside the floats, carrying torches
of the colored Greek . fire. Lights will
flame from the floats themselvesâ from
what Cable calls the "tableaux drawn on
cars."

Captain Kellner himself took mo over
the grounds to show just what has bÂ«en
cut. Some crpress have been felled, but I
the cheap one-story cottages on "Allston
way. nearly opposite Stiles Hall, to the
west. This was a mistake. The old cot
tage would not sell for moving, away for
$250. and all four of the cottages must ap
parently go as soon as the improvements
in the grounds begin.
Just back of these cottages there was a
beautiful windirg lane leading In from
Oxford street, lined on both sides with
cypress and pine. It was much admired
by strangers. Within a month or so it
has nearly all disappeared by the ax,
only about a fraction of It remaining and
looking now commonplace â more like a
back (alley in a tenement district. The
dainty little clump of trees, slender and
exquisite as a bamboo grove, is also
doomed, I am told. t _ . .
Better chop down every ungrateful

The trees on the university ground*
should have been thinned out long ago.
As they stand now. in tho struggle for
room and nourishment they are waging
war against each other. "It is necessary to
sacrifice some that others may live. A
number of trees were lately cut to get
a vista for the astronomers. The workcri
in the observatory have requested this for
years, but only recently were- sufficient
trees felled to give them the needed vista.
The trees on the university grounds were
originally planted much too thickly. A
lover of trees Is naturally loth to soe them
cut. but when it Is necessary ho doea not
hesitate. It is certainly urgent that wÂ«
preserve some of our trees by laying low

proper authority. The committee pa

intend the cutting of the trees â it
would be absurd to imagine such a
thing. We have known for a lout*
time that the tree 3 were sadly in
need of thinning. Jlr. McLaren of

called my attention to the neces
sity.
In thinning the trees several may
have been cut which in the opinion
of some should have been left stand

ence of opinion that arises over an
undertaking of this sort in which a
number of people are interested.
There ere people so foolishly fond of
trees that they would have them re
main where they are decided nui
sances.
There may have bsen one or two
mistakes made in the selection of the
trees to be f3lled. I know nothing
of this personally. But I do know
that we have always stood firm for
the preservation of as many of the
trees as Is reasonable and pos

Day in University
Circles.
WOODMAN, spare that tree! is
the Berkeley cry that echoes
up hill and down dale. The
superintendent of the college grounds,
acting under authority, is thinning
out the trees. It is many a day sines
the Berkeleyites have been so ex
cited.
These for and against the cutting
ars busy arguing with each other and
with those who are neutral. It is
generally granted that the trees need
thinning, but the mooted question is
which ones to cut, and further 'tis
asked whether it is wise to cut any
trees until the new buildings are lo
cated. It is claimed that the ax has
been directed chiefly against the pine
End eucalyptus. Cut the cypress, pro
test the pine and eucalyptus lovers,
and straightway give reasons for
their preferences.
It is a "woody"' and wordy war
that is liktly to wage until the re
turn of President Wheeler.
The interest has reached such a
high-water mark that a summary of
the objections to the cutting of the
trees has httn prepared by those who
protest. This summary is given be-

PERHAPS no place on the face of
the earth are tho people less la
touch with the Fplrlt of the nine
teenth century, to Fay nothing of
the twentieth, than in the heart of
the Pyrenees. I do not refer to their ig
norance of electric lights, of steam plows
r.-.itl automobiles, although the Flow-go
ing oxen are yet in favor for transporta
tion and- the sickle hars never been re
piaced by any worthier implement. Prim
itive as these "things may be, they answer
the purpose, for time Is not precious In
the Pyrenees. What renders the country
most extraordinary and unique is the In
fantile naivete, the Â¦ altogether medieval
simplicity of the people. .The two great
periods of the Kenaissance and ' the Ref
ormation have left no trace In the Pyre
nees. Here It is still the , middle ages
Â¦with all of the mysticism, all of the
miraculous intervention, all of the self
abnegation. The most ardent believers In
other pa/ts of the world are quite unani
mous in the decision that the day of mira
cles Is over, that the necessity for them
is part, but a true Pyrenean would look
cghast at such a statement. In his coun
try miracles are performed every day,
Â¦while apparitions of the paints and angels'
visitations occur with surprising fre
quency. The Grotto of Lourdes, though
of course the most famous. Is not by any
means the only place In this favored re
gion -where wonders are performed. Only
two or three years ago a woman of the
Carmelite order, aged 18. died in the odor
of sanctity. Since her death the greatest
marvels have been accomplished with
remnants of her clothes. The clck of every
description are cured by touching; her
garments, and the cell which ehe occu
pied has now become the object of pious
pilgrlrrages from far and near. Strange
to say, although innumerable pieces have
been cut away from the garments to send
to the sick who wer* unable to make the
pilgrimage, they are not in the least di
minished, growing miraculously on each
occasion to their original 6ize and form.
But greatest and most beautiful marvel
cf all. In the cell where she Uvd and died
angels sing perpetually. That this Is true,
I have the testimony of a pious old lady,
wooden spoon and a napkin. I must con
fess that In visiting this department" I
marveled at the presence of the napkins.
Of snowy whiteness, they seemed a trifle ,
luxurious, accompanying the earthen cup â¢
and the wooden spoon, J and when -I â¢
thought of the bread and water diet they
teemed a trifle superfluous. However, let
us hope that a generous and merciful
Divinity will pardon this Indulgence on
the part of the Bernardlnes. Â»
At every few steps In tbo convent hangs
some Inscription In huge black letters
which contains the word "Death." It. ls
Impossible to forget for one moment one's
Inevitable destiny. "Are you prepared?
This hour may. be your last. Reflect on
Death,". ls a sample of the Inscriptions.
Another one that I noticed was to this
effect, ' "That* you may not sin because
you have beautiful hair,* cut If off. Beau
: tlful eyes and fa beautiful face have
caused much sin. Detest them, and think
about '= Death. 'V .
The nuns', cemetery is within the con-
vent liiclosure and is the favorite resort
of the . Bernardines. Here they prom

o'clock every day, each one digs a shovel
ful'of earth from her own grave.- *
As the, Bernardines, are vowed never to
speak a word, the Servants of Mary, at

which I presume are not numerous, re

carrier are the only venders who are wel-,
corned. at the back door of the Bernar-,
dines. J"-\

who heard the angello voices. "Oh, It
was wonderful, superb,'.' she said to me,
her cheeks burning with ecstacy. at the
bare recollection. "I thought that I
should die of .Joy. When I first entered
the c*Â»Il I heard nothing at all," she went
on ardently, "and - a great sorrow pos
sessed me. I thought that I was not good
enough to hear the heavenly voices. Then
I fell on my knees and I prayed our dear
Lord to pardon all ray sins. I was disap
pointed because the angels did not sing:
to mo. but I struck my..'breast and said:
'Lord, thy will tip done. , lam not worthy
of this great happiness. Thy. blessed will
be done.' Then as I prayed and prayed
with all the fervor of my boul I seemed to
fall Into a sort â¢of ecstacy, and air of a
sudden I heard ; the angeilo voices. At
first they were indistinct, as though com
ing from a distance, then- they approached
convents, one a sort of accessory to the
other, but both of more than ordinary. In
terest. They are shut off from the outside
world by a row of purple^ hills the
sun â¢ falls to . rest, . the only suggestion of
the 'hand of man within their -.vista being
the towers ' of > the Bayonne cathedral,
which rear their, crosses aboyethe lowest
hill. One of the convents is the home of
the Bernardines, .the other Â»ls conducted
by the Servants of Mary. The'Bernar
dines, from the time that they; enter till
they die, speak never; a word except, to
their confessor. ' They spend their time in
meditating on death, In ( contemplating
skulls and In digging their own -'graves.
In their midst are many Princesses and

. As an outcome of this medieval disposi
tion which predominates convents
throughout the Pyrenees are very numer
ous; the hills and valleys are. simply full
of them, most of them ' being conducted
not by such orders as the Sisters of Mercy
or the Sisters of Charity, whose work in
co well known and appreciated the -wide
world over, but rather by contemplative
orders like the Carmelites and the Ber
nardines, who are pledged to eternal si
lence, and whose only duties are prayer
and mortification.
Several miles from Bayonne, In a region
Jonely but divinely picturesque, stand Cro
gulshed 'ladies, who, Â¦scorning the world
and 1 all of" its pomps, withdrew to the soil-' 1
tude, of the hills to better give them
selves to God., With their own hands they
built. a few cabins wherein the only fur
nishings were a board and a straw pillow;
for each to sleep on and the only decora
tlons'skulls and crossbones. ; The fame of
these Â¦ holy women spreading throughout
the country, applications to Join them
were numerous;; bo that in time quite 'a
little group of c,abins:was visible on thÂ«
hillside. 1 Each person entering was re
quired" to h,ave enough of a fortune to sup
port herself In this fashion for the rest of
her daysi for/no, bread-winning was al
lowed among the Bernardines. They werÂ«
there to meditate, to pray, to adore and
to glorify God and to atone in some mcas-;
ure by excessive mortification for the sins
of the world. As their only diet wai
bread and water the entrance fee was not
exorbitant.
During the reign of Napoleon 111 he and
the Empress Eugenic often came to Biar
ritz, where they had built a beautiful aura-,
mer palace. The Emperor heard of tha
Bernardlne ' retreat in the loneliness of
the hills and determined to visit It. In
fact, ' It', appears '.that one of the ladled
well known at;hls court had abandoned'
the pleasures of, Imperial favor for this
life of prayer. and mortification. AtithÂ«
command of the > Emperor,- a well-known
abbe"escorted the imperial party to tha-
Bernardino retreat. There was consterna
tion in the cabins when the distinguished
visitors arrived, for It, was one of their
vows that no man should ever, behold the
face of a Bernardlne. But, quickly they
drew their veils and- appeared before the
Emperor enveloped . like mummies.
"I'll bet that they're all old -and ugly,"
the. Emperor remarked, merrily, to the
abbe, "or else they would never cover
themselves "in" that fashion. A pretty
woman always finds some way of reveal
ing her loveliness. It's as natural to her
as It is to breathe." â¢
1 "I do not know,", said the abbe. "They
make their confessions to us, but we
Inever see them."

but not all of them by any means. Un
der the ugly straw hats I saw bright eyes
and rosy cheeks that yet could do their
chare of mischief in the world. VÂ»'e were
silently watching the penitents at their
work, when the convent bell rang for
hourly prayer. Instantly they fell on their
knees, while the beasts stopped without
one word of command, seeming to bow
their heads as if joining in the act of
adoration. It was a Millet picture, yet a
far deeper pathos than the brush of Mil
let has ever suggested.
For women of this description, coming
from the heat and glare of great cities,
from stuffy dens of vice and iniquity,
what a sweet penitence it must be, this
life In the open air, with the .trees and the
plants, .the purple hills and the setting
eun!
During the prayer we noticed one young
penitent who bowed her head lower than
any of tho others, who struck her breast
and in every manner displayed a greater
fervor. Her jet black hair, twisted into
as hard a knot as possible, yet showed It-
relf of rare abundance, while around her
fare played a row of unmanageable curls.
As she ruse from her knees she raised
her eyes and we raw that tney were black
as night] She was a beauty of tltf- Span
ish type, in every respect a perfect Car

When we joined the little nun who had
been detailed to chow us the convent I
ventured to ask her about this penitent.
"Oh, every visitor asks about her." she
answered. "Poor child. She has an un
fortunate beauty that attracts a great
deal cf attention. Spanish people are al
ways very curious about her. At one
time she was a famous character in Mad
rid, a great sinner. I might add. but now
1 think that she is a great saint. For a
long time her name was connected with
that of a well-known Spanish nobleman,
and It appears she tried to kill his wife,

were fought about her and several men
were killed on her account. One day.

Ho Vow was appointed Consul General to the ' \\\*

for San Francisco. This was an honor for any man, a/id \\\' ;

The question arose as to what to do with the little folks. Â» ?\v
This question was not easily answered by their mother. \
It was plain enough that the little girls should be left '
behind, but It was n&t easy to leave them. Mrs. Ho Vow is,
above all things, domestic* Her home and her family are
very dear to her, and the good-by was hard. -But the girls
must be given a Chinese education. It was fitting to let Sul
Fun learn English, as his father had done before him, but for
young ladiesâ that was another matter. The old-fashioned
aristocracy of the houses Ho and Sul rebelled at overadvanced ,
Id* as. Where women are concerned the most radical Chinese
turns conservative. Therefore it was deiclded to leave Sui Sing
and her sister with their mother's mother in China. -
Mrs. Ho Vow tried to be cheerful for the sake of the two
who were with her. This is the way of home-makers the world
over. But for all that she was a very sorry little woman when

<** -Â» ON. HO YOU', our Chinese Con-
I \ sul General, is the youngest of flvs
\] sons. The father of this thrifty
X J family was Rev. Ho Yang.
+/ Rev. no Yang was onÂ© of the
first Chinese ordained ministers In connec
tion vrith the London Missionary Society.
It was by his married name of Ho FooJc
Tong that he was known best to the Chi
nese community at Hongkong. This name
descended upon him according to tha cus
tom of names in China. Upon marrlago
a wife bestows her name upon the hus
band, which is his forever after and de
scends to their children.
This worthy parent. Rev. Ho Yang.
made such progress In his work of en
lightening his countrymen that ha re
ceived distinguished notice In a bio
graphical work Issued by the London
Missionary Society. There was only one
other man thus honored, that other being
an Englishman. So it will be seen that
our Consul is heir to linguistics by tha
clearest kind nf title.
Rev. Ho Yang was a translator. He ia
said to have been the first person to trans
late the Ten Commandments correctly into
the Chinese language. He is. the author of
a commentary on one of the New Testa
ment booksâ l have a copy of It In my
library.
So much for the reverend gentleman as
he appeared before the public eye. At
home he was another man. He- was a
dignified papa.
Seven small people grew to bÂ« bljr peo
ple in his household. The two daughters
did what is rare for Chinese ladies to doâ
thÂ«>y learned English. One of them la now
the wife of hi 3 Excellency Wu Tins
Fang. Minister at Washington. The other
married a Hongkong editor.
Every one of the five sons has a neat
record on his own account and is some
thing more than the son of his father.
The records stand in this wise: 1;,.-^
Ho Chee was the eldest. He was edu
cated in Hongkong and was taken Into
Government service there. So much for
the big brother.
The second was Ho Tim. He, too, was
educated at Hongkong and graduated
L \\l IO^V there from Victoria College. He was appointed official Inter
ll \\\\ X_y 1 preter and translator for the British Government.
R AYWI I) Ho Wy Son came nÂ« xt - * Ie was an English scholar and a
St WWI H lawyer, at the same time being a Chinese graduate, with a
NL \\V\ Zr degree conferred by the Chinese Government.
Â«Â»V \\\\ / Ho Kal was fourth. He was a graduate In medlcino from
~f\ \\\\ * the Edinburgh University and took his degrea at the age of 21.
\\\â * Afterward he studied law and graduated as a barrister at LJn
Â¦Â£t-YA \\ V^u coins Inn. He was first prize man.
>>,j4 \\\ \ Hon. Ho Vow Is tho fifth. He received his English educa-
k yM \\\ A tlon first in Hongkong, completing it in England, where hÂ»
BUM \\\ 7 graduated as solicitor. From England he returned to Hor.s-
MH \\\ ' kont; and went into business with his brother, Ho Wy Son.
jftfflÃ| \\ y !" this work he obtained hi 3 Icpral practice. When the Govern-
HHm \\\ mentin 18P7 chose him to b^ Consul General to the United States
Â¦A \\\ Hon. Ho Vow was an English scholar and a full-fledged Eng-
Bh \\\ Hsb lawyer, as no one holding the office before him had been.
jpP 1 A\\ As soon as he reached San Francisco ho looked about for
fPZZ-^^Z^d^ work to do. The field promised plenty. The Six Companies
were In need of reorganization, being much demoralized. Hon.
-- 'yH. Ho Vow promptly reorganized. To see with him Is to think: to
VJ^>/ think Is to act. He soon broke the back of the boycott that until
=s-^<^s -^<^ then had caused so much bitter feeling among his countrymen
-throughout the United States. He exerted himself to better the feeling
\ between the Chinese in America and the Americansâ the Fourth of July
\ celebration was the mark of his hand. He has improved the trade relations
I between the two countries, paying close attention to whatever concerned thÂ»
/ rights of the Chinese mercantile community.
'Ji All of this work has been possible to him because of his English educa
tion. Given the greatest executive, mind in the world, and a man would still
fumble when he came to dealing with a foreign tongue. Hon. no Vow speaks
purer English than the average of our own nation; he knows It even down to tta
Idioms, and he will serve his regrets with "awfully sorry."
His enterprise at present Is the building of a hospital in San Francisco for his
own people. He wants to have it patterned after the Alice Memorial Hospital la
Hongkong, an institution endowed by his own family of Ho.

be wantin' to say to me," said Shan. "Is it wantin' to'ax
what fortin' I'm a goin' to give me daughter, the gom

"He's not wan to be makin' up to a girl for the sake
o' the money," said Eily proudly. "He'd sooner' be â¢
marryin' me, widout a rag to me backj or a. shoe to me
fut, than be makin' the best match in all the Barony."
"Sakes alive!" exclaimed Shan in mock alarm. Â¦-.-" If
'tis talkin' foolishness the. omadhawn do be,\we must .
get shut o' him as fast as iver we can."
Ei]y skipped behind the old man's chair and pre
tended to box his cars. . .. ; -v'Â«
"Faix! it's yourself 'can talk the . fine foolishness.
Dad! An' to punish ye, I won't be tellin' ye the lad's
name at all, at all." She screwed her lips up as tightly Â¦
as if they were to remain closed for ever and busied
herself about the hearth in preparation f or. the supper, i:
Shan leaning back comfortably in his chair,. watching ;Â¦
her pretty .face with twinkling eyes: " 'Tis a ; mighty on-,
healthy thing for a woman to have somethiri' on her
mind and not -be lettin' of it out." he soliloquized to
the fire. "I've heard tell of wan such as was taken wid
fits. an' died before the mornin'." Â¦ : Â¦
Eily could hold out no longer: her lover's name was
forcing the closed lips apart. "What wud you be think- -
in' now of Larry Sullivan for a son-in-law?" she queried
cxultingly. *? -?.. '"_Â¦.'-:
Larry Sullivan, the son of a well-to-do farmer, was a
much better match than Shan could have expected for .
his daughter, and Eily felt like the beggar-maiden when
King Cophetua stooped to her from his throne.
"'Larry Sullivan? Is it Larry you're wantin' for â¢ a
husband? â¢ Augh thin, wud nobody else serve' your turn
as well?" asked- Shan, who knew the world too .well
(that is, the little world of Kerry, which has its own V
social laws) to be able to share in his" daughter's delight." ;
"There's nary a bhoy an the Barony, savjn'. himself. :
as' I'd be after touchin' wid a ten fut pole," Eily declared
with fine disdain. .
, "Musha thin! what will th'ould father be sayiri'? Shan
asked doubtfully.
"Larry won't heed." '*
"Tis Nancie Shehan. a girl wid forty pouns to her
fortin'. they do be wantin' Larr>' to coort."
"Forty pouns! the saints be above us! 'Tis nayther
forty pouns nor yit forty shillin's as they'll be gettin'
wid a daughter-in-law."
Shan shook his head sadly, and lowered his voice '
as if about to venture on a delicate subject: "Sure, the
saison's: been a bad one, alannah, . . an' moneys
none too plentiful wid the ould people . . . an' 'tis
forty pouns they'll have to be handin' over to thewiddy
Brady's son afdre the villain '11 consint to marry their ;
Lizzie." -
Eilv crew crimson and turned her head aside. It was
money saved up, and ,-Mr. Macclurc's ready and
willin' to . take him back as coachman. An' he's
to have a boat on the -lake, as he can be hirin' out to
the quality;vyhin they come. here for the fishin,' and. wid
: wan thing' an' another, there'll be . lashuns an' lavin's o\
money, an' th'ould Dad <:an quit frettin' over the rint,
an' we'll be.as' happy as the fish in.the say. or the birds
inthe trees,' livin' us three;together in this cottage, as
is- big enough to hold twiste as many." *$$&
Shan passed his hand over", the smooth black head that
had; found its way to his knee and asked with tender
eagerness: "Is it willin' th' pair o' yez wud be to stay
widUh' ould Dad? Arrah! but that's grand news, any
ways. Sure the fear o'losin' me 'birdie has. been clutch
in' at me heartstrings, this many an' many a day, The
- holy ' saints be Â¦Â¦. praised for puttin' the thought of re
mainin'wid me into both your hearts!" â¢
Â¦ "It was of 'The States' an' no lessj that Larry was first
thinkin'," said Eily. "But I ups and tells him as I can't
be Â¦ lavin' th' ould Dad i for the best husband as ivcr
sthepped in shoe leather. Thin he sed as how he'd be
quite willin'. to live; here wid us, an' be a son to yez.
Wid the help o' God an' his holy Mother, it's grand'
times intirely we'll be havin', us three together."
"Begorrah! t 'Twill be a little heaven on earth!" ex
claimed Shan,' who' was catching fire at :the flame of
Eily's enthusiasm.
They were still discussing the. good times in store for
them when the latch avas raised, and a talirbroad-shoul
: dered youth stooped , under ? the ; lintel .. and entered the
kitchen, with- the customary greeting," "God saveV' all
here." - : '
Eily sprang to her feet, but instead of advancing to
greet the ne t w-comer -she retreated behind her â¢ father's
chair. : There's an instinct of modesty or coquetry (call
it, whichever you like) in -Irish girls that tends to make
them coy. and 'reserved in their manner toward a favored
lover. ..-./' ..."'Â¦ ... ' Â¦ .'...,Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢
"Sit ye down, Larry, sit yedown. Sure 'tis kindly/,
welcome ye are." said Shan, "piling up a: plate and push-- 1
ing it toward the'youngman. Larry seated himself, at '
the table, but instead of doing honor to Shan's hospi
. tality he; heaved -a deep sigh and fixed his eyes on his
sweetheart's pretty face.
"There's iomethin' on your mind, Larry, me bhov,"
said Shan, after an uncomfortable pause. "out wid it." ',;â¢
"I'm the most misfort'nit' devil on -God's earth this
night." Larry burst forth. "An\ 'tis not carin' aithra- i
neen for me own pain I'd be, Mr. Cqnhor.sorr, if Eily,/
C-nA oitv thÂ« crather I hadn't to share it wid me." . :
"Arrali now be aisy! mind the fiddle, whativer ye do!'
he exclaimed, laying it gently down in. a comer. "Tare
snd acf^l it's soon hurted, the crather is. as if it had
life in it."
He sat down in the big chair and with one arm still
around his daughter's waist, plunged the other into his
pocket and drew forth a few shillings, which he spread
out on the table with a deep sigh. "A bad week
acushla â on'y five of thim, an' the rint overdue, bad cess
to it!" , /"'Â«'â¢; '~*M : i
Thr fart of having been all but caught at her childish
flay had brought a crimson flush to Eily's cheeks that
made her look as prettily guilty as a seventeenth cen
tury heroine with a. lover hidden behind a screen. . To
escspc from the old man's affectionate scrutiny she
pathered up the shillings, and rising on tip-toe. let them
drop, one by one. into a. crocked teapot that fisrured as
an ornament on the high chimney shelf.
"It might ha' been better. Dad. but thin aei.n it might
ha* been murh worser," she remarked with cheerful
philosophy. "Supposin*. ye had conic strcaling home on
me wid nan- a shilling' at all?" " .'
"Sure, child, 'tis not botherin* I'd be if on'y we'd got
enough for the landlord."
"^n* who's to s*y 9* ye won't be havin* it afore ve're

Mike <God bless him!) been tellin' the 'quality' as there's
riot a fiddler in all the country side to aquil ye! An' sure
they're havin' a 'dance Sunday, an' they've sint him up
to jx you to play for thim." " #
"Musha thin, is it the famtjv that nntsjthe big house
on the other side o' the Bay?" ;
"It is so. Mrbbe 'tis another five shilhn syell be get

Shan shook his head- despondently: Arran Â¦ now!
Eily turned deadly pale and, leaning both elbows on
the table, cried out eagerly, "Don't be kapin a body on
the rack, Larry avic! ... For God's sake. say.
quick what's the matther?" ' â¢ .
"The matther is just this, Eily jewel: I've come th:s
night to give ye back your promise. . . . J ls j
future husband of crooked Nancie Shehan that's dis
coursin' wid vez now."- . ; i;r -
Shan looked his guest full in the face. A fire of hon
est indignation was burning in his eyes when he said:
"Be the God above us, Larry Sullivan! ye're the^ bold
man to tell me to me face as you've .been playin' wicj
me daughter's feelin's! . . . I'm none so ould an'
wake, mind. ye. but I could send ye. into eternity if I
was druv to -it!" . .
Eily sat quite upright, with her lips pressed tieht to
gether.'.: Not 'for worlds would she have given vent to
the grief that was rending her in the j^isence of her
false lover. s*?c;
Larry looked a picture of despair as he made answer:
"Ye couldn't render me a bigger sarvice. .Mr. Connor,
than to be after killin' me. But ye must first listen to
what I've got to say. 'Tis truth I m tellm ye. sorr.
I'd rather a dale be cuttin' the tongue out o me mouth
than be spakin' the words I'm obligated to spake to fei
both this night. . . . Th* ould people must be Â«t
tin' forty pouns for Lizzie's fortm , an they looks to
me for it. I offered to go to Amenky an work nish:
day till I'd got the money saved up '(it wudn t ha'
took long; me married sister could find me a place to
morrow), but they sez 'twould be too late; me sister"}
good name wud be lost." ' Â» . -
Larry blundered through his confession with a burn
ing face and a feeling of overwhelming shame. When
it was over he got up from his stool and looked at Eilv
with imploring eyes. "I'd better be takin' meselt out or
it on you now," he said sorrowfully. "Sure 'twas tie
bad day for you whin first we met. . . . Don't be
thinkin' too hard things of me. alannah! The heart
widin me's broke wid the cruelty ofit.'
"God pity ye, me poor bhoy, exclaimed warm
hearted Shan, taking both the young man's hands
"Tho' it may go nigh to break the colleen's heart, I je;
now as 'tis on'y your bounden duty to act as ye are
actin'!" _ , .....
"God bless you, Mr. Connor, for thim kind words,"
said Larry, passing a rough hand across his dim eye*
Then his mood changed suddenly and he raised the stool
on which he had been sitting high up in the air, as if
about to hurl it at an antagonist's head. "There's more
than one duty afore me," he growled in a voice hoar??
with passion, "I'll do me duty be me sister an* I'll di ii
be that scoundrel Brady! There won't be a bone ur.
broken in his ugly carcass whin I've finished doia' n :e
duty be him!" -; â¢ . -^. : . : " .
Hitherto Eily had remained motionless, her whole
form stiff with repressed emotion. . . . She now ct
tered a cry of alarm and looked up imploringly fa
Larry's face: "Whisht! For God's sake whisht!" she
moanedâ "Sure, it freezes the .very marrow in m- bon?s
to hear ye talk like that! What good wud it do for ?cz
to be destroyin' wan another?"
"IsnVit the wan thing I've gt>t to look forrard to?
Me life's ruinated be the black-hearted villain, an* I've a
right to be payin' him out."
? 'Musha poor lad! Sure the God above knows well aj
he isn't dhramin' of wickedness at all, at all," said Shan
eoothingly. To make assurance doubly sure the old
peasant traced a large cross on the air in case any derr.m
of revenge were hovering poor Larry's soul. Eily
ho longer felt herself that terrible being, "a woman
scorned." She was' now Larry's fellow-sufferer in an
what for wud they be givin' five shillin's to the likes o'
me?"
Eily looked at him with an impatient little frown-
To-night of all nights in the year she wished him to be
hopeful and light-hearted.
"Have a draw o' your pipe, Dad, whilst I'm toastin'
the herrin's," she said. "It s worn out ye are this very

She lit the pipe and placed it between his lips. Then,
stooping down, she proceeded to unlace the heavy
brogues in which he had tramped many a weary mile
that day, and bade him stick out his stockin' feet an'
give thim a toast at the fire.
Presently Shan glanced at the table. "Is it expectin'

roguish, dimpling smile. "There's a young man a com-

X^^jl in its cradle of so:t
*^Â»- brown hills, is a little
* thatched cabin that peeps
â â¢.hj'ly down at you from
behind a hugt boulder.
Shan Connor, formerly one of the best dancing
makers in Kerry, lives in it with his only daughter,
whose love trouble I am about to confide to you.
Rheumatism forced him to retire. from business some
years ago, but, even in his best days, his income, far
from being on a par with his reputation, barely enabled
him to keep the rent paid and the pot boiling. He was
obliged to .vander far and wide in quest of pupils, stop
ping lor a week or two in any village that was willing to
receive him. housed and fed by each family in its turn,
and receiving a fee of I shilling per pupil.
His daughter Ei!y led a loneiy life. A couple of black
cow?, a few goats and hens and a fierce but intelligent
mongrel were her only companions during her father's
absences from home.
Let us peep in upon her as she sits waiting for him,
one chill October evening, some twenty years ago.
Oat of doors the setting sun was still flooding the
western sky with crimson, but within the cottage all
was dark, save for the cheerful light of a turf fire, over
which hung suspended a three-legged pot, rilled with
potatoes for the evening meal. A big arm chair, with
a patchwork cushion, was drawn up to the fire and be
side it ?tood a deal table with three plates, three glasses
and a jugful of buttermilk. The broken saucer, that
figured as a center piece contained a pinch of salt, a bit
of butter and three red herrings waiting to be transferred
to the gridiron as soon as Shan made his appearance.
There was also a wee drop of potheen in the corner cuo
board, but that was only produced when the Dad was
very weary indeed. Eily. dressed in her best Sunday
clothes, the crimson petticoat with its three rows of
black velvet, and the neat shoes and stockings that she
found it irksome to keep on, was sitting on a creepy
Etool drawn clobe to the fire, with her elbows on her
knees and her face in her hands. The roguishâ twinkle
in her eye and the merry smile that played peep-bo with
the dimples in her soft checks, were proof positive that
solitude had not as yet preyed upon her spirits.
Suddenly an idea flashed through her mind and
mace her seize upon the dog that was snoring peacefully
by her side, roll her apron around him and then dangle
him from side to side as if he were a restless child that
the was trying to quiet. The animal submitted with
lazy good-nature; fixing his intelligent eyes on her face
he appeared deeply interested in the cradle song she was
croon in g. ,v â¢*. _^ ./
A man's* heavy tread sounded outside the door and a
hand fumbled with the latch. . Quick as thought the
nursling was dropped to the gToundand Eily flew to
welcome her father.
. "Is it sittin' in the dark ye are, me darlint?" Shan, a
tall white-haired peasant, asked as he stumbled across
the threshold. i-*'
"Sure, wan can think widout a light," said Eily, bc

If the narrative of Shakesppare's his

The task of Mr. Quiller-Couch has cer

corrupt and oppressive acts deliberately
committed, sometimes by persons high in
authority. The injudiciousness of exert
ing .compulsion by methods regarded by
the men as unfair Is Illustrated by Mr.
McManus in the statement that many vet
erans preferred re-enlistment in various
foreign services to rejoining the American
army. Man for man the American regu
lar soldier may lay claim to superiority
over the soldiery of any other country.
Intelligence, independence and an obe
dience to discipline, grounded not on ser
vility, but on loyal devotion, are the se
crets of this superiority. If snich oppres

Charles Keeler's "Bird Notes Afield" Is
a little book Intended to spread the love
and knowledge of .out-of-door nature
among the unscientific. It abounds in
charming passages of description, espe
cially of the life of songbird."* and sea
birds. Among these appreciatively poetic
passages are interspersed bits of Infor
mation intended to make the recognition
of California birds easy to the uninitiated.
The sensibility to outer nature and the
grace of expression which characterize
the descriptions make the expository por
tions of the work ?eem However,
they only Interrupt and do not much mar
the literary part of the book.
The key to the birds which follows the
text exhibits the same combination of
purposes, but the popular and the scien
tific elements are here not mixed, but
fused. The key strives to attain a scien
tific end .without Â¦ employing scientific
means: to enable untrained observers to
classify birds without recourse to techni
cal terms or systematic knowledge. Tho
result of the attempt Is net successful. A
few accurately discriminated â¢ technical
words . and precise marks of discrimina
tion'would be easily learned and far morÂ«
easily applied than such vaeue descrip
tions as "partly black" or "largely yel
low." In pplte of these defects the, book
Is a delightful on". (Elder' & Shepard.

a collection of brief narratives, giving a
view of the earlier events In the struggle
with the Filipinos as seen by the private

sketches have a vivacity and a de/mlte

powers of observation. Among the most
interesting passages are those which de
pict the agreeable and wholesome rela
tions between the American soldiers and
some of the native families. The view of
the sunny home-life of Jose Manuel's
family, kindly, hospitable. Industrious
and self-respecting, is charming In itself
â¢and glvesj^ unconscious and pleasant testi

of Mr. McManus 1 own character. The
magnanimous admiration shown for the
soldierly and gentlemanly qualities of

recognition of the better elements In the
Filipino character are worthy of a soldier.

Ants as Sirategists.
From a military standpoint the methods
employed by ants to provide food for an
ant colony are almost perfect. Their for
aging parties are faultless, both in plan
ning and execution, and are almost uni
formly successful. A resident of this city
who is at present in business in South
Africa has sent home a description of a
foray of an army of ants
The army, which he estimates to hayÂ»
numbered about 15.000 ants, started from
their home. In the mud walls of a hut.
and marched in the direction of a small
-mound of fresh earth but a few yards dis
tant. The head of the column halted on
reaching the foot of the mound and wait
ed for the rest .of the force to arrive at
the place of operations, which evidently
was to be the mound of fresh rarth. When
the remainder had arrived and halted, so
that the entire army was assembled, a
number of ants detached themselves from
the main body and began to ascend to
the top of the mound, while the others
began moving so as to encircle the base
of the mound.
Very soon a number from the detach
ment which had ascended the mound, evi
dently the attacking party, entered thÂ»
loose earth and speedily returned, each
bearing a cricket or a young grasshopper,
dead, which he deposited upon the ground
and then returned for a fresh load. Those
who had remained on the outside of the
mound took up the crickets and grass
hopper? as they were brought out and
bore them down to the base of the hill,
returning for a fresh load. Soon the con
tents of the mound seemed to be ex
bausted. and then the whole force re
turned home, each carrying his burden
of food for the community.
Here. then, was a regular foray, plan
ned and executed with military precision,

The impulse to plant the American flag

quality of universality, the tale becomes
merely a striking example of perverted

The extremely slow movement of the
narrative, which drifts and eddies and
even flows backward, results In Irritating
tediousness. At times the story stops short
while the reader is entertained with the
rtetails of a surgical experiment, written,
with professional accuracy, or with the
gossip of two nurses about pathological
minutiae. The force of the story Is the
force of violence and extravagance, not
of strength which in its utmost intensity

"The History of Canada, for Toung
Readers." by J. N. Mcllwraith. is really
a record of the separate annals of the
Northern British colonies, with a view to
insisting on the grounds for a separate
Canadian patriotism. Respectfully as Mr.
Mcllwraith looks on the British empire,
he feels himself a sharer and equal, not a
eubject. It is really a little unkind of him
to :neist so vigorously on the manifest in
feriority cf the United States Americans
to the United Provinces Americans. Hum
bly acknowledging our inferiority, we
should like to be left alone to enjoy it.
We even prefer to write the Knclish lan
guage after our barbarous fashion, hold
ing to our delusion that such syntax as
Mr. Mcllwraiths is loose and incorrect.
Mr. Mcllwraith's narrative is too an
r.a'ittic Cor its purpose; too Imperfect in
emphasis ar.d perspective. The spirit of
it teems to point to future difficulties.
Canada is now in a position to enjoy the
twetts of sovereignty without its respon
sibilities. The British diplomacy in the
Bering Sta question shows this. Great
Britain was ready to come to terms with
the United States when the peremptory
demands of Canada sent the home Gov
*.i r.ment in a flurry to the right about, and
the United States was called on to offer
a <;'-id pro quo not to the responsible old
mother country but to the exacting child.
This three-cornered diplomatic game will
tome day be impossible. .
Another question of interest is suggested
by Mr. Mcllwraiths prophecyâ is it a dis
loyal prophecy?â of the time when
French and English Canadians will re
member only that they are Canadians. In
that day will the essential divergence be
tween'**^ French and English in every

The inside history of the election of tha
successor to Farleyby the. Legislature of
1885 has never been written.- The Legisla
ture was Republican on joint ballot.
Aaron A. Sargent had been understood
since hiv return as Minister to Germany
to be in line for election to the' United
States Senate. During the campaign of
ISS4 his candidacy entered 'argely into tha
election of members. of tne Legislature,
and It was believed that he had the back
ing of the Huntington wing of the railroa 1
people. George C. Perkins and M. M. Es-
a similar bill and presented a = resolution
calling for an investigation of the recent
election.' This resolution was adopted, b/
the Senate but failed In the, Assembly.
While the Legislature refused to proceed
with the Investigation, the charges did not
die out. . The annoyance their discusdion
occasioned, with the culmination of a;di
rect charge, by the Democratic County
Committee of San Francisco' in the fall of
1573,' caused Casserly to resign his scat,
after having served a little over 'four
years. .
In. the Legislature of, 1871-72 the Demo
crats had a majority in the Senate and
the;Republlcans a majority of over two
to'one in the House. There , was a : de
cided advantage for. the Republicans on
Joint ballot. That Legislature was called
upon to elect the successor of Cole for
the term to commence March 4,1873. This
was the second election that was held
under the Federal law that requires the
ler. chivalry Democrats. TherÂ«
were twenty-two ballots. On tha
first McDougall received 27 votes. TV> I
ler 27, Nugent 9 and T. G. Phelps, the Re
publican caucus nominee, 23. On the la!Â«t
ballot McDougall received 58, Nugent 47
and Weller 6. The president of the con
vention, supposing that McDougall had re
ceived a majority of the votes, announced
his election, but a few days after It was
resolved that there had been no choice.
McDougall relinquished all claim to an
election, and on April 2 a new elect'on
took place and on the first ballot McDou
gall received 57 votes, Nugent 39 and Wel
ler 4, whereupon McDougall was elects!
regularly to serve until March 4, 1867. In
the course of this contest a quarrel oc
curred between Daniel Showalter and
Charles W. Piercy. members of the As

Latham's successor was elected by the
Legislature of ISC3â a Union body. Tha
principal candidates were T. G. Phelps,
Aaron A. Sargent, Trenor W. Park an-1
John Conness. There was a very bitter
contest, and for several weeks little or ria
progress was made. Phelps had the do
clded advantage at the outset, but he
could not secure enough by five or six
votes for the caucus nomination. TowarJ
the end of January rumors of bargain
and sale on the part of Phelps and Con

of Park, became rife. It was reported
that Assemblyman F. M. Smith, a Park
adherent, had been approached by
Charles Watrous, a friend of Phelps, and
offered J3OOO and a political position for
his vote for Phelps. At the same time It
was stated that Cyrus Palmer, a Park
Assemblyman, had been approached by
Zeke Wilson and - offered positions for
himself and friends If he would. procure
clx votes for Phelps. These charges
came up In the Union caucus In the shape
of an inquiry as to their truth' on Janu

son-in-law of Park, rose and stated that
Smith had notified him of the corrupt
proposition of Watrous, . and , had asked
him and R. C. Gaskill to be present; at

houses to meet in Joint convention, and It
required a concurrent resolution to set the
day for the Joint meeting. However. Feb
ruary 17 was agreed en as the time for the
meeting. When the hour of 12 arrived the
Af-sembly was engaged in a call of the
house, and the Senate took a recess for
ten minutes to give time to prepare the
chamber for the reception of the Assem
bly. The Senate chamber was on the
ground floor, and on account of the crowd
U was deemed imprudent to hold the con
tention in the Assembly hall upstairs.
When the session of the Senate was re
pumed it was stated that several Assem
blymen were absent and that there was
c rumor on the ctreet that one member
had b*>en drugged the ni{:ht before to pre
vent his \oting for Senator. While a vote
was being taken In the Senate to postpone
the joint convention the Assembly was it
thÂ«- door. The motion to postpone was
rsrried. and the astonished Assembly was
In a quandaryâ it had a Joint convention
on its hands and no Senate to help to ad
journ it. However, the joint meeting was
held and forty-nine votes were cast on
the first ballot; twenty-five were neces
rary to a choice, and no one had near that
number. The balloting was continued un
til the 2Sth. when the one hundred and
forty-second ballot was taken without re
fu!t. acd then, satisfied that they could
nÂ»ver agree, the convention adjourned
sine d!e.

cratic candidate for Senator, and the

The historical Broderiek-Gwin struggle
r*ran in IÂ£H. Both men were Democrats
enO each a leader of a wing of the party.
Broderick was the head cf the Tammany
or Northern Democracy, and Gwin the
losder cf the Chivalry or Southern wing.
The two were as dissimilar as were the
constituencies they represented. Broder
lck was the pon of a stonecutter, v.lth
only euch education as wan self-acquired.
He had sprang from obscurity Into promi
nence bcrausa cf his natural tact for
leadership. On the ether hand, the path
of Gwin had r.ot had a thorny strewing.
Early in life he had the favor of General
Jaxrkscn, ar.d through It was given the
open sesame to offlce.- He saw at the
close of the Mf-xican War the possibility
for greater political honors in the new
State that must come into being on the
Pacific. Ills strength laid not In the per
sonal following he created In California,
but In the powerful influence he could
command at Washington. The election of
a Senator to succeed Gwin should logical
ly take place Jn 1855, but Broderlck. feel-
Irq that he could not control the Legis
lature of 1554, determined to bring on the
election a year In advance. The Whigs
were In a hopeless minority, but having
nothing to lose by delay united with the
forces of Gwin. At one stage in the ex
citing events that transpired a single vote
v.ould have turned the balance In favor of
Broderick. On January 19. ISM. Ellsha T.
Peck. Senator from Butte County, rose to
. a question of privilege and stated that on
the 7th. while a passenger on the fiteamer
from San Francisco to Benlda, the then
State cajiital, he had been Introduced to
Joseph C. Palmer of the banking house of
Palmer, Cook & Co.. and that later on
that day Palmer had offered him J5OOO If
he would vote to bring on the election at
that session. A committee was appointed
to investigate the bribery charge. Palmer
turned the tables on Peck and explained
that the latter had approached him with
a suggestion that If he was paid the sum
named he would not only vote to bring
on the election but would secure an addi
tional vote.
There were exdtin* meetings of tnÂ«
committee. Tha counsel who appeared
were General Charles H. S. Williams,
Stephen J. Field. Hall McAllister and
Colonel Edward D. Baker, among the
ablest lawyers In the State. But when
tha Senate took tha final vote the result
mi ridiculously absurd. It was In effect
that tha bribery charge against Palmer
had not been sustained, but that the de
cision was not intended In any degree to
reflect upon the honor and dignity of
Peck. At the i>ame session the question of
the removal of the State capital to Sac
ramento was an Important Issue and It

Roach proposed an amendment to the
State constitution that the Governor
should be ineligible to the offlcÂ© of United
States Senator during his gubernatorial
term. While the amendment failed In
proposal by the Legislature It played a
part in the reasons for the calling of the
Constitutional Convention in 1579. A few
days after the Senatorial elections A. D.
Bell, an attache of a San Francisco news
paper, published a statement that the
final vote of Senator S. J.J inney. I hat
had at the last moment been changed
from Shafter to Booth, had been infij;
enced by the receipt of a specific sum
Bell refused to give the authority for
his statement, and the Senate adopted
a resolution to the effect that he_ alone
was responsible for the authorship of
the charge and expelled him frontta
reporters'- desk In tha Senate Cham
ber. Afterward there was a recon
elderatlon by tha Senate and tha In
cident ended by a general smooth-
Ing overN and apologies. A similar
exposure transpired in the . Assembly in
reference to one Converse. Ha had stated
that ha could for money control the Leg
islature The Assembly Issued a warrant
lor bis arrest; a committee to investigate
wu appointed: a conviction of contempt
followed, and he_waÂ» sent to Jail for six
caucus nomination. When the Legislature
m^t those three were the only candidates
and the odds were in favor of Sargent.*
An unknown factor, however, was held in
reserve by Creed Haymond and Senator
Henry Vrooman, and the surprise was not
sprung until the eve of the meetirrg of tha
Republican caucus. Soon after the legis
lative session opened seven members rrvt
at the rooms of Vrooman. In the Clint*
building, and after a discussion a 't>a;<cr
was drawn up to pledge its sis;ne; 3 to
vote on the first ballot their choice for
Senator, but that on the second ba Int.
their votes should be cast In the panv
caucus for Leland Stanford. There was
a further understanding that each of tH*
seven should Interview other members.
and that such as would abide by the un
derstanding expressed In the pledge shou',l
be Invited to attend, a nv-*-tinÂ«
on the following evening. The roll was
thus swelled and within a week It carried
the names of a majority of the Republican
members. The friends of Perkins knew r>;
and Joined In the movement, many of
those who had been pledged to Sargent
fell Into line, but Sargent and those who
were his stalwart supporters did nit
dream of the new departure until a fÂ».r
hours before the final consummation ct
the scheme. According to the programme
Stanford was nominated In the Repubucvi
caucus on the second ballot. Wh<*n :t
came to the balloting In the houses thera
were but two candidates presented. Stan
ford on the part of the Republicans aM
George Hearst on the part of the Demo
crats. In the Joint convention Stanford
had 79 votes, Hearst 27, Nlles Searls 1
and Farley 1.
Governor Stor.eman called this sama
Legislature to meet In extra session In
July. I&S6. After the regular session had
adjourned the year before, Senator Miller
had died and Hearst ha<l be-n appointed
to serve In hla stead. It doubtless had
not occurred to the Governor that a Sen
ator could be elected at an extra session.
but the Federal statute was clear upon
the subject, and on August 3 the houses
proceeded to elect a short-term Senator.
â¢William H. Parks, the Speaker of the As
sembly, occupied the same position in this
contest that Sargent had In the resri'.ar
session. He had the support of the Hunt-
Jngton branch of the railroad. A. P. Wi 1 ,.
liams was the candidate of the Stanford
wing, and In the Republican caucua hÂ»
carried off the prize on the first ballot. In
the Joint convention Williams received
70 votes, to 24 for Hearst, and was de
clared elected for the unexpired term, to
end March 4. 1887.
The Legislature of ISS7 was chosen with
a view to the election of a Senator. It
was apparently a Democratic year, and
the railroad preference was known to ba
George Hearst. As the campaign wen:
on this became apparent by certain com
binations made In Republican districts.
There was opposition to Hearst In his own
party, but his Invincible alliance with tha
railroad made all attempts to defeat him
apparently futile. When Democratic can
didates for the Legislature were nomi
nated Hearst sent them checks for S&'M
each, with the request that they use tha
money in their campaign end vote for him
If elected. These checks were returned by
some, but most of them were kept, cashel
and In many cases more was asked f^r.
It Is said that this use of money in a Sen
atorial fight was the motive of the finest
speech ever made by Stephen M. White.
It was at the Democratic State Conven
tion at San Jose, and began: "I am am
bitious to make it possible for a poor man
to aspire to the Senatorship. He was
never forgiven by Hearst or the Exam
iner. W r hen the Legislature of ISS. m-t
It was suposed that Hearst had a walk
over. His flght was In the hands of M, 11

and Christopher Buckley. It became com
mon rumor, however, that English and
Clunie handled the sack.
English, who was to be appointed Har
bor Commissioner. waÂ« reported to, offer
places on the water front for votes for
Hear3t but as cash was preferred, tha
story got out that Hearst s managers
were holding out the cash and paying In
promises of patronage. Tha feeling be
came so bitter that when the Democratic
caucus met on the 11th day of January
only 45 were present, a number that cou'.d
not elect a Senator In a Joint convention
of 120 legislators. Archibald Tell was
elected chairman of the caucus an.l Lon?
Green" Lawrence secretary. Hearst s
iiipporters made bitter speeches denounc
ing the absentees After muc h wrang
ling the caucus adjourned to the Htn. it
became apparent that some disagreement
existed between English and Clunie on
one side and Buckley on the other.
Hearst was present and took an activw
part in the fight. Thera is a verified
Statement extant that he finally took mat
ters In his own hands. The price to b*
paid for each vote was carried on a Join.,
roll call of the Legislature, which came
afterward to be known as "the wash
list " and on adding these amounts the
sum of $190,000 was paid over, and at th*
next meeting of .the caucus sixty-four
members were prwent. The sing Â«

others and got a place in the Custom

/Governor !n 1871 by the Republicans,. but
Ibecame the leader of the new political
movement, and there was no misunder
standing that he would be urged for tha
fcenatorshlp In the-event of the success
of the Independents, for he had In his
ispeeches during the rarapaign declared
that he had | "burned the bridges behind
him," that would have led back to the
Republican side in the case of a failure.
As stated, Casserly, had resigned and
Booth sought -the -long term that would
commence on March 4, 1875. There was
also to.be considered the election of a
Senator for the short term, to end at the
date mentioned.' The: matter came up in
the:houses on -December 16, .1873. In the
Senate/for the full term. Booth and
; James T.- Farley (D.) and James McM.
Shatter (R.) received each 13 votes; in the
Assembly Booth had 43. to 2S for Farley
: and 9 for Shafter. For the unexplred
term John S.Hager (D.) had in the Senate
IS votes, Jesse O. Goodwin (Ind.) 8. Cor
nelius Cole (R.) 5: while in the Assembly
Hager had 32, Goodwin 10 and. Cole 18.
There. being no joint choice the matter
came up Â¦in ] convention : on . the 20th, when
Booth, was' elected for the full term, to
expire March 4, 1881, by a. vote of 61 to 37
for Farley find 27 for Shatter. Three days
later -Hager. was elected to the unexplred
term by a vote of 65. as against 20 for
Thomas H. Lame and 13 for Shatter. This
had been the second Instance In which a
Governor, had been elected to the Senate.
Booth retained the office of Governor un
til he Was: ready to proceed to Washing
ton to take his seat in Congress. Directly
Assembly would pass the bill to bring
on the Senatorial election as Broderlck
desired, and his opponents confined their
efforts to beat him in the Senate. Tha
Assembly passed the bill on March 6 and
the flght went to the Senate. In that body
the greatest excitement prevailed, mani
fested by an ominous silence. Broderick
wen out by one vote, but on reconsidera
tion the following day the Senate receded
from its position and the project of forc
ing on the election was ruined. The hopes
of Broderlck to obtain the coveted priza
were, for the time at least, hopelessly
crushed.
In the Legislature of 1555 the scenes
shifted. Gwin started in with a Demo
cratic majority, but still with not enough
to control the election. Fifty ballots wera
taken from January 18 to February 16. On
the first ballot Gwin had 42, Broderick 12,
Philip L. Edwards (Whig) 36, Joseph W.
McCorkle 14, James A. McDougall 2. with
4 scattering among other Democratic can
didates. The play of Gwin was to bring
on a caucus; that of Broderick to prevent
that movÂ«Â» and to Ptave off the election
for the session, with the hope that tha
future Legislature would be favorable to
him. There was a reversal of the posi
tions of the factions from those that had
been assumed In 1554. With consummate
skill Broderlck and his adherents fought
off the caucus and when it became appar
ent that the time of the Legislature was
being wasted to no purpose the Joint con
vention adjourned, leaving the term of
Gwin expired with no elected successor.
The "Know-nothing" or American party
carried the election In 1555 and controlled
the Legislature of 1556. At that Eesslon
Henry S. Foote, formerly of Mississippi,
came within one vote of election to the
vacant Senatorshlp. Wilson Flint, a Sen
ator from San Francisco, though a mem
ber of the American p?Â«ty, sturdily re
fused to vote for Foote. believing that he
was a pro-slavery man and a carpet-bag
ger to this State. Without the vote of
Flint no progress could be made. His lifo
was tnreatened. but hi 3 friends guarded
him so well that no harm came to him.
The new party lacked discipline, and vÂ«is
E'j divided that no- candidate could be
agreed on. The Democratic minority,
with a little aid from dissatisfied "Know
nothings," passed a resolution through
the Senate declaring it Inexpedient and
contrary to the wishes of the people to
fill the vacancy, and the election was post
poned until the succeeding Legislature.
In the Legislature of 1857 Broderick was
king of the caucus. There were two Sen
ators to be electedâ one for the full term
and the other for the four years that re
mained on the unexpircd, term of Gwin.
Broderlck was elected lor the full term
on the first ballot. There were many
aspirants for the short term, and all paid
court to Broderick, for the decision lay
with him. The history of the Intrigues
connected with this election and the cun
ning of Gwin in estranging Broderick
from come of his friends is too familiar
to be again recounted. Gwin abjectly
appealed to the magnanimity of his tri
umphant enemy, and while under exas
peration at disclosures that. seemed to
point at treachery of those he had trusted
Broderlck instructed his followers to vote
for Gwin and he was elected. Gwin had
promised In writing to permit Broderick
to dispense all of the Federal patronage,
but no sooner had the new Senators
reached Washington than It was apparent
that Gwin had the ear of President Bu
chanan and the control of the offices on
this coast. The bitter war that had been
waged between the two men : broke out
with added rancor; the Democratic party
In the State was rent in twain, and the
culmination of the storm of battle was in
the gubernatorial election In 1859. Both
Senators stumped tha : State; their
was Interjected Into the Senatorial flgntâ
the friends of Broderlck favoring the ra
moval. The bill to remove to Sacramento Â¦
passed and it was assumed that tba flght
for Broderlck had been won, but tha
movement did not accomplish the result
that was expected. At the session at"
Sacramento It was understood that tht^
speeches were bitterly personal. There
was the bloody termination that seemed
unavoidable, as the custom of that day
was. It was very generally known that
Broderlck would be killedâ in fact, the
newspapers had gone so far as to discuss
the subject during the campaign. After
the election a challenge was passed to
Broderick, and he fell in the famous duel
In September. 1559.
Governor Weller appointed Henry P.
Haun of Marysville to serve out.Brodcr

Latham was elected Governor In 1859 by
the chivalry Democracy, and the second
day after his inauguration the Legislature
adopted a resolution to go Into the election
of a Senator to fill the Broderlck vacancy.
Thera was then no Inhibition to the elec

It was well known that Latham wanted

March 4. 1860.
The election of the successor of McDou- '
gall was tame and uneventful. The Joint
cpnventlon met on; December 16, 1865. The
Union caucus, on account of the difficulty
of agreeing upon a more prominent cand!
d.ate. had nominated Cornelius Cole, and
he was elected by. a , vote of 92 as against
26 complimentary votes thrown for Will

On* December 20. 1867, Eugene Casaerly
was elected to the Senate to succeed Con

the third ballot, .receiving 69 votes'" pÂ«
against 45. Including a majority, of the
Senate, cast for Thomas A. Brown. ThiÂ»

The Determination of
food Standards.
THE'present Board of Health is
organizing its committees with
a view of maintaining a high stand
ard of foods. In order to secure a
pure food supply the interest must
not come alone 'from the Board of
Health, physicians or press, but
must emanate from the household
ers themselves. One of the main ob
jects in the establishment of a food
bureau is to encourage the houss-
holder to submit all doubtful samples
for analysis. This is a striking prin
ciple of the municipal laboratories
of Paris â special attention is paid to
samples offered by the citizens.
One of the greatest difficulties that
confronts us in our efforts to stamp
out adulterated gqods is the lack of
a national standard for pure foods.
There is such a standard for lard and
butter. and possibly one for cheese
and flour, but all other articles are
subject only to local tests. We have
not. even a State standard, therefore
goods driven out of San Francisco le
gally find a market in a neighboring

BOERS REPORT HAVING
DRIVEN GEN. BULLER BACK
PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT
CRONJE HAS SURRENDERED
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1900, by the New York Herald Company.
LONDON, Feb. 25, 4:35 A. M.â Since 2:15 o'clock yesterday afternoon nothing has .
been received from the scene of what the London papers call General Cronje's .
death-struggle, the War Cff ice officials anncuncing at midnight that they had "
. nothing to give out. They stated that they believed it to be impossible for Cronje to es
cape from the grip of Lord Roberts.
The report circulated in Ecrln that Crcnje had succeeded in making his escape
came from Beer headquarters in Brussels, where it was stated details were still lacking.
LOSTDON, Feb. 25.-^-Persistent reports circulated all day yesterday that General Cronjo had surren
dered, but as the War Office would give no definite information the stories were generally dis
missed as untrus. Lats last night, however, tho rumor again got about in clubs that Cronje was a
prisoner. The War Office, when asked about it, depeated what had been stated during ths day: "Nothing

Nevertheless, the story came from such a source as gave room for belief that it was true, and that .
the War Office was holding back information for some nascn. It is thought by sbma ' that Lord Bobsrts'

all the forces sent against it, would surely retire to another position and await Roberts' advance.
Accordingly this was the argument by some in the clubs last night: *"If Cronjo is captured ; we

cations or to breakthrough to Cronje's relief. As to the Natal situation also rumor has been very. busy. , A series of reports have come '.through Xape Town and Durban that Ladysmith is relieved, but no ercuenee li given the stories.
It is now nearly a week since General Buller reported that he was confronted by only a weak rear guard, yet he appears to have made !very little progress since the capture of Hla:*.g\vana: Mountain and the occupation of Fort Wviie,
which placed in his possession a strong point : on each side of the river. â¢ One puzzling of the situation isfound in the report that the^Boers still have, big guns .on Bulvana; Mountain, though 1 it is not clear 1 whether the re^
doubtable "Long Tom" is still in position there. It was stated two days ago that their big guns had been "removed; oh- MondayV inforrnatidn of which morcthan anything else gave rise to the report and convinced everybody that the
siege of Ladysmith was about to be raised without loss. of time. Now it is. apparent how, inaccurate thisiiriformatioh.was." Consequently the intention of i the Boers to siege of Ladysmith has become v matter of doubt, An ex-*
traordinary telegram which has reached London from Boer sources by a roundabout route states that British force- h^ a story for a moment, since in the opinion o| Blili-.
tar>- experts Bullet, with a grip on "Fort Wylie, and Inhlawe iMountain, could not be compelled to retire except by a v seriqus interruption "to hiscommurinicatiohs. -^
LONDON. Feb. 25.â Face
to face in both the Free
State and Natal the oppos
ing armies stand, apparently
without vital change since Fri
day. It was expected and even
very confidently asserted by thosej
who had made careful .study of
the progress of events .that we
should surely hear of 'Crp]ije's
surrender by yesterday,. but from
latest accounts" he 'sccmsTto > be
still holding out. '
There arc rumors,' but nothing
more, through Cape Town and
Durban that Cronje has surren
dered, but they are: not generally
credited. At any rate the War
Office has not received anything
to back up these stories.
There is Â¦ news under Thurs-
day's date from Paardeberg
which, though not official, is con
sidered trustworthy.* On that day
the Boers were still holding but.
Their laager was being shelled
intermittently, but Cronje had
apparently not altered his mind
and was still determined to per
sist in defense to the last. in the
hope, no doubt, that reinforce
ments would succeed in accom
plishing his relief. That reinforce
ments have, been sent to him is
made clear ,by a message already
referred to, which says that two
thousand "Boers are operating
southeast of the British 'positions.
These may be the force of Com
mander De Wett, which is trying
to make a diversion to enable
Gronje to slip through the net
which has been drawn around
him.
Lord Roberts has with him,
however, an army variously esti
n^atcd at 40,000 to 50,000 men of
all: arms. When one bears in
mind the ease with which the
British have invariably defeated
the Boers when permitted by cir
cumstances .to act on. the de
fensive it is difficult .to believe
that any attempt at relief could
be successful. Such at any rate
is the opinion of the best-military
experts here. .

medicine. Â¦â¢ â¢ /. .-
Not only is it a valuable medicine, but it
is applicable to the climatic ailments of
winter and summer. Extremes of heat and
cold In the United States make it a land
of catarrh.
Xearly everybody has catarrh. This Is
more especially true among the mldde
and lower classes. Exposure to the cli-
mate, hard work and unventilated sleeping
rooms are the principal causes. Charitable
institutions have found, by bitter experi-
ence, that catarrhal diseases not only are
tht; most numerous of all other diseases
put together, but they are the hardest to
cure. Â»
Peruna Is a specific for this class of dis-
eases. No other remedy can take Us
place. Thousands of cases of chronic cd-
tarrh are cured by the use of simply a
bottle. People who have spent large sums
to be cured of catarrh have turned to Pe-
runa as a last resort artd been cured by
the use of a single bottle.

SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 24.-The town or
dinances and those of the county regard
ing the time at which bibulous citizens
must be ejected from saloons have clashed
and as a consequence local bonlfaces niay
be able to conduct business without a li
cense and the festive steam foam in long
schooners till the break of day.
Last Wednesday night the townsmen as
sembled at Armory Hall to dance the
hours away. The oxercise induced a oeau
tiful thirst among the masculine terp
slchoreans. and a saloon within an ea-y
walk of the hall did a land office business
At 11 o'clock, say the Town Trustees sa
loong within the rity limits must close
their doors. The county ordinance how
ever, provides that on the payment of a
fee of 12 J} saloon' keepers may obtain a
special license enabling them to keep open
t:ll all hours of the night or day. The
saloon man. anticipating a rushing busl
jiess, had pungled up his %2 50 and laid in
an extra stock of wet goods. All night
a line of thirsty dancers moved between
the saloon and the dance hall, and the
dance hall and the saloon. It was 4 o clock
before the last schooner passed over the
bar.
Yesterday City Attorney T. P. Uoyd was
instructed by the Trustees to bring suit
against the saloon man for violation of
the town ordinance ordering saloons
closed at 11 o'clock. The saloon man, how
ever, will contest the case, an he has paid
his fee to the Sheriff and had his special
license to keep open past the usual hour.

â¢.â¢5â â â¢ .Â¦
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â Senator Clark
and Marcus Daly, the rival millionaires, of
Montana, faced" one another; '.during the
greater part of to-day in the Senate Com
mittee on Elections In the Investigation of
Clark's election "to the Senate~of "the
United States. Clark eat in the rear of
his attorneys and Daly on the opposite
side of the room. Daly wore a pleasant
smile throughout the day and Clark muln
tatned an unruffled countenance. It had
been expected that Daly would be called
to the, : witness stand during the day, feu*
he wag not. The day was given up tÂ»
J.R. Toole, a close friend of Daly. â¢
Toole's testimony covered the Senatorial
congest from. the Daly side of the ques
tion! '.He -related many^ particulars con
cerning'the-capital contest, placing the
total expenditure In behalf of Anaconda
in" that contest at from $350,000 to $4M,00 1 ;.
Hon. W:. G. Conrad .testified during the
day. : He was a, candidate for the Senata
In,, opposition to Clark. , He said that ho
had spent 'no money ,ln tho Senatorial
campaign proper.
- Atthe-beginning of the session Attorney
General Nolan took the witness stand. He
read.a letter he had written to Congress
man Campbell last fall promising immunity,
from prosecution to such as might testify
to bribery as go-betweens during the ses
sion of the Legislature. He said in the
letter. that he had conferred with the Gov
ernor, and that In case of prose^cution and
conviction the v Governor would exercise
the pardoning power. Referring to thu
Whlteside exposure, Nolan said the peo
ple of Montana did not believe there v.aa
any conspiracy. . â¢';
"The air was full of evidence of brib
ery," he said. "You could cut it with a
knife."
ToolÂ© Defends Daly.
John'R. Toole of Anaconda was next
called. He said he was Interested with
Daly In mining and had since the Ist of
June last been under a salary from h:in
in connection with their mining entei
prises. He considered that he had Daly's
confidence In political matters and knew
the latter's plans. Notwithstanding this
fact he had, as a member of the Legisla
ture In 1898. voted for Clark. Indeed, lie
had never known Daly to seek office or
try to influence the course of his friends.
Last winter when he had told Daly that
some members wanted to cast their vott-s
for him for the United States Senate Daly
had replied:
"I authorize you to say that I do not
want my name presented to the Legisla
ture for a vote, either complimentary or
otherwise." â ,
Nor had he ever known of Daly attemp.
ing to influence or control any primary or
other election, or State, county or city
convention. ; ,
.. Toole also paid Daly had no special can
didate for the Senate, being willing to
accent the nominee of the Democratic
caucus," -Daly's friends, however, opposed
Clark, principally because of the charges
of bribery, with which the air was filled
for a month before the meeting of tiit*
L "^Vhen 1 did you first see the $30,000 used
by Mr. Whitoside In his exposure?", he
was asked. , . , ?''Â¦',
' "I lirst^saw it when the legislative In
vestigating committee, of which 1 was a
member, met." ." , â¢ ,':
â¢ VDid you give any ;of that money, or
; know ofc-'any being given by -Mr. Daly, or
any of his friends to defeat Mr. Clark for
the SÂ«n^tÂ«>?U ; ...... . J
; "No: Mr." I '" can't find words strong
enoughiior; a proper denial of the impu
tation. It's an outrage." . â¢ â¢'-:-â¢ .

up, by Mr. Daly or any ofi his friends to
defeat* Mr.'iClark ;JnVany.- other connec
tlonT.', M *v-V '" I
"1 certainly do not.' ' f
Power of Clark's. -Money.
Â¦ Toole related 1 a* conversation he . had
wKh ; Representative -MeLaughlin at- the
beginning, of- the Legislature, in which
McL'augblin told him that' he was going
to vote for' Clark, as It "was a matter
of bread and butter for his family." He
denied that there was any Daly or dls
tlnctlvelv anti-Clark lobby in Helena
during the session of the Legislature.
"The friends of Conrad, Matts and
others were lost." he said "In the Clark
lobby. That Is all a pipe dream."
Daly had not. according to witness,
dreamed when the Legislature met that
Clark could be elected.
"I never saw so strong an opposition
mowed down by money," he said.
Toole was questioned concerning the
contest over the location of the State
capital. He said he had been a member of
the committee having In charge the inter
ests of Anaconda in that contest.
: '.'I- can only approximate the amount
spent." he said, ''and I don't know that
I can come within $100,000 of the total
amount. I should say, however, that from
$250,000 to $450,000 was spent in tho inter
ests of Anaconda. It must be borne in
mind, however, that - that Â¦ contest con
tinued over three or four years."
.He said that perhaps 75 per cent of the
total amount had been spent in thelmst
year of the contest. The money was raised
Hy subscription, many citizens subscrib
ing, including Daly. He had himself given
one-fourth, of his estate to the cause.
Faulknerâ Did you not say after Mr.
Clark's election that If you had had $liw,
000 more you could have defeated him, and
that with $200,000 you could have elected
yOur man? . :;, ,
;."I'dld not. "We 'could have beaten h!m
with, half the sum. .because I believe tint
with that much money It would have been
possible to Â¦ have the Republicans who
Â¦voted' for Clark go on making patriotic
speeches and voting for men In their own
â¢party." â¢'.
Conrad Spent Little Money.
Hon. W. G. Conrad, who was Clark's
principal rival for the Senatorshlp In 1599,
was the next witness.
"Did you spend any money In the State
campaign?" Campbell asked.
"I did: from $:>OOO to $10,000, giving If to
committees, etc."
"Did you spend money in your effort to
secure your election to the Senate?"
"I did not spend to exceed $200 in Helena
beyond the amount of my hotel bill."
Continuing, Conrad said that he had
never been associated in any way with
Daly, and only seven or eight of : his
friends were in Helena during the Sen
atorial campaign. He denied the state
ment of a former witness that he hint
drawn $50,000 from the American National
.Bank of Helena after the Whlteslde ex
posure. He also said he had not con
tributed any part of the $30,000 used by
Whlteslde. He had his bank checks and
stubs for the past thirty-two years, and
was willing the committee should inspect
them. Conrad said there were thirty votes
pledged to him in the Legislature, but he
failed to receive ten of the votes go
pladged. -.-v: .:Cy. y

JAMESON'S RAID

Keeping Chamberlain in

Great Outcry Aroused by the Candl
. dacy of Major McÃride of the

Copyrighted. 1900, by the Associated PresÂ».
LONDON, Feb. 24.â Apart from the dra
matic change that came over the situation
in South Africa, the event of the week
was undoubtedly Joseph .Chamberlain's
vigorous, almqst vicjous self-defense In
the .House of Commons. .The Colonial
Secretary met the accusations and de
mands with-one of-those terrible fighting
speeches for which he is noted. -With
venomous retort and scqrn he once more
denied complicity }n the.' Jameson raid;
denied the so-called revelations of the
independence Belgo'and with" deft phrases
resented the Opposition's agitation as a
personal attack upon his much-persecuted
eelf. In the heat of 'debate and 'with ail
overwhelming majority^ readyÂ».;tp - cheer
c.very bitter phrase, Chamberlain' carried
all before him. But after reflection many
of those- who thoroughly Relieve Chamber,
lain to be absolutely untainted and who
place- no importance on the letters stolen
from Mr. Hawksley, counsel for the Brit
ish South African Company, regretted
that the Colonial Secretary took up the
matter' fn such a personal spirit. . -â¢
â¢ Chamberlain Rebuked. Â¦â¢ â¢Â¦ >
Voicing this feeling, the Saturday Re
view, while strongly, deprecating- another
raid inquiry at the present' juncture, de
plores "CWajrfberlaln's "undignified .attit
ude ..and reminds him that .'the good
faith of a Secretary of State Is hot a per
.sonal but a" public matter. Continuing,
the.paper says It regrets that" ho did not
'court a resumption, but aflds that bbviou3
reasons of state prohibited such a pro
cedure at thepresent crisis. ; . '.';
In the meanwhile Dr. Gavin Brown
Clark, Radical member of Parliament for
Caithness, who was formerly Consul-Gen
eral of the South African Repuhlic. stands
accused by Mr. Hawksley of having
bought stolen property In the shape of
letters In regard to the raid. Thougn Mr.
Clark has denied the allegations printed
in the St. James Gazette, he has not so
far denied Hawksley's charges. Ills fel
low-Commoners are much stirred up irf
regard to the matter, but Clark seems un
likely to take any steps unless ills con
stituents force an issue.

Major McÃride's Candidacy.
The nomination of Major McÃride.of the,
Irish brigade in the service of thV'BoeYs';*
to contest South Mayo, vieev^Michael
Davitt, resigned, has created no iitfrle out
cry. . Another Nationalist. John Â£)'DonJ
nell; opposes Major McÃrlde. Cotysequer.t-J
ly on February 26, when the 'â¢X-rfting is,
done, O"Donnell and the absentee-candi
date will fight it out between them. Tlie
authorities pay so little attention xti Tiis;i
disaffection that no steps have been'tak&it'
to 'prevent Major McÃride contestingHhe
seat. The indulgence of the Government,
of which this is an instance, fosters the
feeling that Irish advocacy of the Boer
cause, and. In fact, the whole Irish move
ment, is of no great Importance. -This, it
Is. claimed, is as the Government desired
it to be.
The condition of the navy and the al
leged inadequacy of the newest estimates
are creating no end of discussion. The
fact that the Government has ordered the
reserve squadron to assemble at Ports
mouth on March 1 has relieved the fears
of those who thought continental interfer
ence was imminent, but they hall with no
pleasure the accompanying announcement
that the squadron will be scattered again
on April 1, after a month's exercise.
Nor is public confidence strengthened
by such statements as arc made editor
ially in the Naval and Military- Record,
which avers that there are eight or nine
modern French battleships capable of
sinking the reserve . fleet, and. though
France has, now only six of such vessels
with her northern squadron, she could
quickly got the two nerded "from the Med
iterranean without attracting suspicion,
while the amalgamation of her northern
squadron with that of Kussia'a Hal tic
fleet would altogether outclass t Great
Britain's reserve, which, this 6ervlce pa
per declared, is a heterogeneous and by no
means a modern conglomeration, lacking
in all the essentials of a trained battle
fleet. As a remedy, it is urged, that new
ships not Included In the reserve be im
mediately commissioned, and that a pow
erful modern licet be assembled In home
waters to await contingencies. The army
â or, rather. Its system and the majority
of its generalsâ has so disappointed the
bulk of British people that It Is almost a
fad to criticize and underestimate every
thing British, and the navy is coming In
for Its share. Events have yet to show
that such criticism is justified.
Amalgamation of Capital.
Earl 'Grey,' who Is a peer and who votes
with the conservative party, but who is
connected with many labor organizations,
especially In labor co-partnership or the
co-operation movement, of which he is
the prime mover, recently, addressing a
co-operative meeting at Glasgow, -referred
at length to the colossal amalgamation of
capital in the UnH*d States, and said the
same tendency was apparent on this side
of the Atlantic. He declared the disad
vantage resulting from 'the consolidation
of Industries consisted In enabling those
in controling the market to force up
prices to the limit the consumer would
bear. He added:
"The co-operative plan restricting the
rate of interest on share capital to o per
cent and prohibiting the transfer of
shares to the open market alone supplies
the method by which construction can be
affected without endangering the inter
ests of the community."
The United States cruiser Albany, pur
chased here Just before the war with
Spain, whose complement of men arrived
on the United States steamship Prairie,
probably will sail In about a fortnight.
Her officers are busy at Newcastle* get
ting their command into shape.
Horrors of Indian Famine.
The plague in India continues virulent.
There were 583 victims in Bombay City
during the week ending February 16.
With over 61,000,000" persons affected, by the
famine' and only about 4,000,000 in receipt
of relief, India seems to be In a bad
plight, though the death rates over the
f.50,000 square miles of the famine area are
decreasing. The Indian Government has is
sued a resolution approving Professor
Haffkin's anti-plague inocculation, and
the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, is advocating
Its use throughout India and is paying
high tribute to the professor.
The Spectator, which â¢ often voices the
Government's views, claims it is to Great
Britain's ' advantage to have the United
States fortify the Nicaragua canal, saying
the idea that Great Is against,
such action Is a .delusion. The Spectator
adds: "If America asks us to give up the

REVIEW OF THE
GAME FIGHT AS
MADE BY CRONJE
LONDON. Feb. 24.â Spencer Wilkinson,
summing the week's events In the war in
South Africa for the Associated Press, to
night says:
"On the night of Thursday, February
15, General Cronje marched out from Ma
gersfontein between General French, who
had just entered Klmberley, and General
Kelly-Kenny, then at Klip Drift, on the
Modder River. The next day General
Kelly-Kenny pursued him, attacked his
rear guard and delayed him until the
Highlands brigade was on Its way to stop
him on the south banks of the Modder
and General French could pass him on the
north bank.
"After a three days' running fight Gen
eral Cronje was stopped at Koodoosrand,
near Paardeberg, where he was surround
ed. His force was between the river
bank, which gave him a defensive posi
tion facing either way, so that attacks on
him involved heavy loss, but he was held
until on Tuesday Lord Roberts arranged
to grip him with a girdle of infantry in
his position, while cannonading him with
fifty guns enfilading the river bed. In the
meantime Lord Roberts, with a spare di
vision or two beyond the three brigades
holding Cronje, set himself to intercept
and drive away any Boer reinforcements.
"This was the situation on Wednesday,
and it offered a reasonable possibility of
the capture of Cronje's force and of the
defeat of any reinforcements. We. have
little news beyond Wednesday. On Thurs
day the shelling of Cronje was continued
at intervals, continuous shelling proba
bly involving a too lavish use of ammuni
tion. The Boers have been giving them
selves up by fifties a day. On Tuesday
Lord Roberts drove off reinforcements
coming from Colesberg and from Natal.
"A Berlin report declares that Cronje
had forced his way through. This Is im
probable, but may refer to a small party
who may have escaped in the night.
"Lord Roberts' advance has * drawn
away some of the Boer forces from Coles
berg, Sterkstroom and Natal, as Is seen
from the diminished resistance to the
British at all those points.
"General Buller. after taking Hlang
wane Hill, has crossed the Tugela River
and, according to the latest telegrams,
has been fighting continuously since
Thursday morning. This looks like a de
cided attempt to relieve Ladysmlth.
wherein I expect General Buller will suc
ceed, if he does not, as before. Interrupt
his advance by stopping to count his
losses and declaring that he has. lost
enough. A general has never lost enough
to justify the giving up of his enterprise
so long as his troops are willing to go on
with him. Ladysmith can probably hold
out for several weeks longer and In that
time the effect of Lord Roberts' advance
will probably be even more marked than
it has yet been."

KIMBERLEY'S

CAPE TOWN. Friday, Feb. 23.âEx

respondent at Kimberley give an Insight
into the trials of the garrison. They are
In brief as follows:
January 12â Scurvy attacks the natives
alarmingly. They are dying fast. The anti
scorbutics are exhausted. Vine cuttings being
tried in lieu of green food.
January 12â Typhoid Is prevalent. Failure
to boll the water the probable cause.
January ISâ Fifty typhoids In the hospital.
January 16â The military authorities have
commandeered all the foodstuffs and other mer
chandise. Leave has been granted to the In
habitants to shoot small birds for food.
January 17â The mules slaughtered are pro
nounced superior to horse flesh.
January 23â Five hundred shells poured Into
the town at haphazard, the hospital, scurvy
compound- and residences receiving the atten
tion, probably due to the earthworks.
January 25â A small family shell-proof shel
ter has been dug in nearly every garden.
February 11 â Twenty-five hundred women and
children were lowered Into the mines through
out the night. The men -are also selecting
places of eafety.
February 15 â All the morning there was a
heavy cross flre of the British occupying
Alexandenfonteln. The hundred-pounder and
shrapnel are bursting; over Klmberley. Every
cne Is lying low. The shops and banks were
closed. At 2 o'clock this afternoon there was
a kaleidoscopic change. Heliograph signals
were discerned announcing General French's
approach. Clouds of dust of the rapid advance
of the advancing cavalry were then seen and
almost simultaneously the enemy was observed
limbering up and fleeing eastward.
The glad tidings spread with marvelous
rapidity. From all directions mounted and
unmounted men hastened to welcome the. re
lief column. Those remaining hoisted flags and
there was a universal feeling of Joy and thank
fulness.-

BRITONS ARE
REPULSED WITH
A HEAVY LOSS
PRETORIA, Friday, Feb. 23.â A special
dispatch from Colesberg, dated Thursday,
February 22, says:
"Commandant Delarey moved out and
decupled a position east and south of
Arundel, where the British were, en
camped. At sunrise the British attacked
the Boers with cannon, Infantry and cav
alryt the Boers replying. Late in the
evening when the Boers were attacked In
their rear by a force presumably- from
Naauwpoort, rendering the Boer 'position
untenable, the British attempted to storm
the Boer cannon, but were repulsed with
heavy loss. The Boer casualties as far as
known were two men wounded."

The Sabine's Seizure.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.-The incident
connected with the seizure by a British
gunboat of the British steamship Sablne,
with a cargo of goods from New York,
is closed. ' A cable message was received
to-day at the State Department from Em
bassador Choate stating that the vessel,
which was at Port Elizabeth, had been re
leased and allowed to proceed on her way.
the least squeamish of Parisian gutter
sheets has found impossible to print. This
man, who claims the throne and should
at least have the manners of a gentleman,
admits having sent his royal congratula
tions to the author of a disgustingly ob
scene caricature of our Queen. This is an
insult which Englishmen will refuse to
forgive."
I am told by an authority on South Af
rica, Mr. Pardy, who has lived all over
that country, that the crushing out of
Cronje means that the war will not last
three weeks. His opinion I find echoed by
those who have had experiences with the
Boers.
The city, which is not often at fault,
takes the same view, backing its opinion
with its money.
The rise which has taken place brought
Rands almost to their former palmy po
sition in the market. This has been done
entirely from the Inside, for the public ap
parently will not come in at any .price.
Berlin, it is true, has helped, fairly heavy
buying orders having come from there.
The Berlin Stock Exchange takes a
strategical view of the situation and Is
buying. Perhaps one of the most eloquent
signs of the times lay in the smiling faces
of the African financiers as we saw them
on Thursday evening at the grand concert
in Covent Garden Opera-house. They have
been in suppressed spirits for some time
past, but on this occasion they were, as
one might say, buzzing about much In evi

If there is one thins the Prince of Wales
Is particularly sensitive about It Is these
caricatures In Le Rire. His Royal High

the damning evidence which the St.
James Gazette brings from Its Paris cor
respondent, Mr. Strong, as to the admis

the Due. Both the Queen and the Prince
of Wales have been particularly kind to
the Due. but he need scarcely look for any
more courtesies from the same quarter
unless he publishes a vindication of the
charges made against him.
The St. James Gazette comes back to
the charge and says:
"We published yesterday a letter from
our Paris correspondent giving some In
formation about the proceedings of the
Due d'Orleans. which should be known in
this country as widely as possible. Like
many another who has found his native

i ence to the sealing of the Hon. M. S.

â¢â¢i desire to notify tho Senate, however,
he saia, -ihat on Mot day \ will call up the
resolution, and if no member representing
the majority report of the Kleciion Com
mittee is ready xo speak the minority will
proceed with the debate."
After the passage of a number of minor
bills consideration of the Hawaiian Gov-
e rnment bill was resumed, the pending
! fjuestiun being the amendment by Platt
> of Connecticut providing that the Presi
dent should appoint the Chief Justice.
Justices of the Supreme ' Court and Jus
tices of thÂ« Circuit Court, and that the
Governor of the territory should appoint
the other officers, the amendment limiting
the tenure of office of appointees to four
years. Platt. in an extended speech, sup
ported l.is amendment, holding that the
provisions of the bill were Inconsistent
with those Incorporated in previous ter
ritorial enabling act.<*.
In a vehement speech Tlllman attacked
the bill as reported to the Senate and ar
raigned Mr. Morgan for alleged lack of
courtesy. , , ,
Referring to an Incident which occurred
the other day. in which Morgan declined
to yield to Tillman to reply to a state
ment made by Wolcott of Colorado con
cerning the "suppressed vote" of South
Carolina, Tillman'sald:
"I have felt Indignant at the treatment
I received from the Senator (Morgan).
Never In my experience in the Senate
have I been treated so discourteously by
any member of the Senate."
Morgan endeavored to interrupt Till
man. but th* latter waived him aside,
"I decline to yield to the Senator. He
has put himself outside the pale of cour
tesy and consideration so far as I am con
cerned.". Â¦ ~ Â¦
. In the course of a criticism of the meas
ure Tillman said: '. â¢ :*Â¦
"I don"t object to a protection of the
whites of Hawaii, but what I do object to
is the hypocrisy of those in this chamber
who maintain that- the people of Hawaii
are to be treated differently from those
Â¦who reside in Louisiana, Mississippi, South
Carolina and other* Southern States. The
whites of the South are patriotic Ameri
cans I want you to. protect; the whites
of Hawaii, but don't try*. to do It, by hy
pocrisy."
Tillman then read a letter, from a per
son .unnamed, who declared that "a man
who dares to oppose the sugar barons in
Hawaii Is In jeopardy of his 1ife." ... . - j
Clark of Wyoming asked for the name
of the writer of the letter.' saying such
a charge ought not to be made lightly In
the Senate. Tillman declined to give the
writer's name... '
After expressing some sympathy with
the argument of Tlllman Clark of Wyom
ing said:
-When the Senator from South Carolina
charges Senators on the Republican side
of the chamber with hypocrisy it comes in
very very poor grace for him to declare
by Almighty God that the negroes of the
South should not vote." .
Tillmanâ Such a construction cannot in
fairness be put upon my remarks.
Clarkâ Will you say to this Senate that
you are not trying, in the South to sup
preÂ«s the negro vote?
Tillman (with grent vehemence)â No; I
will say that In South Carolina we have
done our level best to keep the "nigger"
from voting.
Tillman gave notice of an amendment
substituting the suffrage provisions of the
South Carolina constitution for the suf
frage provisions of tho pending bill. At
4:40 tho Senat" went into executive ses
sion and at 4:45 adiourr.ed.

House Republicans Hold

COMPROMISE IS PROBABLE
? /
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OF
TEN NAMED.
It Is Generally Believed the Bill Will
Be Amended So as to Be Opera
tive for Two Years
Only.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â At the con
clusion to-night of the conference of Re
publican members of the House on the
Porto Rioan , tariff bill Representative
Cannon of Illinois was elected chairman
and was authorized to make a statement
of the general results. He said:
The conference was In good temper, and a real
effort was made to harmonize differences of
opinion concerning the Porto Mean tariff bill.
It looks as though this effort would be success
ful. Alter full dlhcusslon the confereuoe by
unanimous, consent acreed to the selection of
a committee of ten mf-mbers. Jive of whom were
to be appointed by the chairman of the caucus
from among those In favor of the bill, and live
were to be appointed from those who do not
agree to the bill in whole or In part, the ap
pointments to be made by a committee of three
consletinst of Representatives i'owers of Ver
mont, Crum:>acker of Indiana and Lorlmer of
Illinois. This committee Is to report Its con
clusions and recommendations to a Republican
conference to be held in the hall of the House
Monday evening next at S o'clock. In accord
ance with the resolution 1 have named Messrs.
Payne, I.ialzell, Hopkins. Russell and Dolliver,
and the other live are to b* handed to Chairman
Payne to-morrcw.
The conference met at 8 o'clock ia the
hall of the House. About 100 Republican
members were present. The element in
opposition to the bill was weil represented,
McCall, Littlelield, Powers, Lorimer ana
others prominently identified with the op
position being on "hand. Cannon acted as
chairman.
Speaker Henderson took an active part
In the conference and made the iirst
speech of the evening. He spoke in a con
ciliatory spirit, urging that differences be
reconciled by the exercise of toleration on
both sides.
The llrst definite proposition came from
Pearre of Maryland, who suggested a
compromise fixing two years as the limit
for the operation of the proposed tariff.
Pearre supported this in a speech indi
cating no purpose to make an is^ue
against the bill, but rather a disposition
to secure united action by compromise.
Powers of Vermont was the first to give
voice to the opposition sentiment. He said,
however, that he had come into the con
ference in the hope and expectation thac
differences would be adjusted. His ro
marks were regarded as tending toward
a harmonious adjustment.
Chairman Payne of the "Ways and
Means Committee spoke at considerable
length and manifested some feeling at
times. He disavowed any pride of opin
ion In the bill, as he. had not drawn it,
although as chairman of the committee It
had fallen to his lot to present It. Mem
bers gathered from what Payne said that
the Secretary of War and those War De
partment oHTcials most familiar with
Porto Rican affairs had drawn the bill.
Payne conveyed the impression that the
President was not opposed to the bill, cer
tainly on the constitutibn.il questions in
volved, although he carefully refrained
from any. direct statement as to the atti
tude cr- wishes of the President.
Grosvenor of Ohio was expected to make
a statement directly indicating the Presi
dent's desires, but he carefully refrained
from doing so. He said that he had re
cently attended a banquet where he was
expected to "speak from the throne," but
he had' prepared a speech which wholly
omitted any authoritative statement. So
to-nlÃht. he said, he did not Intend to
Vspeak from, the throne.'" He said that the
proposition.. limiting the operation of .the
bill to two 'years was as far as the meas- :
ure should be changed.. -Â¦
The speechmaklng became general â Hill,
Cannon, Sperry, McCall. Brown of Ohio, '
Fletcher. Lacey. Tompklns and Littlefield
succeeding each other. La coy brought for
ward a compromise, giving to the Presi
dent full authority to act. For a time the
discussion turned on this proposition, but
It failed to develop much strength.
The speeches of McCall and Littlefield
attracted much interest because of the
positive attitude they have taken. McCall
spoke calmly, but did not state his oppo
sition to the measure as a whole, and
showed a disposition to accept any of the
compromises suggested. Littlefield was
more vehement, declaring that he had not
surrendered his views against the meas
ure as a whole, although he felt disposed
to turn the subject over to the President,
as had been proposed. Littlefleld sug
gested that free trade be given to Porto
Rico, with a distinct declaration that this
should not operate as a precedent appli
cable to other Insular possessions. This
was met w.ith a counter proposition from
Throop of Pennsylvania that the 25 per
cent, rate, as provided by the original
bill, be retained, with a declaration that
this do not operate as a precedent. Neither
proposition was favorably entertained and
they were not pressed.
Up to midnight none of the propositions
had been voted upon, and members be
gan leavjng the hall. The feeling pre
vailed, however, that the two-year limi
tations would be agreed upon as a basis
of compromise, and that with this change
the hill would receive pretty general al
though not unanimous support. As the
attendance was rapidly diminishing, it be
came apparent that no final action could
be reached to-night, and the plan of a
committee of ten â live from each side â to
go over the subject and report some mid
dle ground was unanimously accepted by
all present.
Chairman. Cannon was authorized to
make public the report that at 12:15
o'clock tho conference aojourned until
Monday night, when the report of the
committee of ten will be received.

BITTER WORDS
IN THE HOUSE
Littlefield of Maine Is
Grilled.
TONGUE-LASHED BY TAWNEY
STYLED A MOUTHPIECE OF THE
LUMBER BARONS.
Minnesota Representative Rebukes
Dingley's Successor for Oppos
ing the Porto Rican Tar
iff Bill.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.â Throughout
the debate on the Porto Rico bill in the
House of Representatives to-day there
was an undercurrent of speculation on
the outcome of the efforts to bring about
united action on the part of the majority
of the House. Frequent conferences were
held between representatives of the vari
ous elements in the hope of bringing about
a common ground of understanding for
consideration at the formal conference.
The debate brought out a speech by Rep
resentative Tawney of Minnesota, scor
ing Littlefield of Maine, for his speech of
yesterday, and also two speeches from the
Republican side by Tompklns of New
York and Powers of Vermont, opposing
the bill. Thayer closed the day with a
defense of the anti-Imperialists. TÂ£e other
speakers were Eddy of Minnesota for the
bill and Clayton of Alabama and Brous
sard of Louisiana against It.
Clayton of Alabama was the first speak
er of the day. presenting a legal argument
against the bill. He maintained that the
United States military forces held Porto
Rico at the time of the treaty and that
the island became as much a part of the
United States as the Territory of Arizona.
Tawney Scores Littlefleld.
Tawney of Minnesota, a member of the
Ways and Means Committee, enlivened
the debate by his severe arraignment of
Littlefield of Maine. Said he:
I have been profoundly impressed with the
great importance of the questions Involved in
this discussion. Until yesterday these questions
had been considered by gentlemen on both sides
of the House with the utmost sincerity, with
earnestness and with that dignity becoming
questions of so great Importance and the dignity
of the forum in which they are to be tried.
I regret that it was left for the gentleman
from Maine to play In this great debate the
part of a buffoon for the benefit of the Demo
cratic party and for the amusement of the
galleries.
The Democratic applause with which that pe
culiar affectation of voice was received yester
day would not have greeted a speech made
upon the pendlns bill by that late peerless
American statesman and always loyal Repub
lican predecessor of the gentleman from Maine.
The hope of notoriety or the existence of legal
technicalities would not have induced that gen
tleman (Dlngley) to have left the ranks of the
Republicans and joined the ranks of the Demo
crats simply because his judgment did not co
incide with the judgment of his associates upon
the Ways and Means Committee or upon the
floor of this House respecting party policy. Nor
could he have been induced to exhibit that
want of decent courtesy toward the members
of that committee or his colleagues upon the
floor of this House which the gentleman (Lit
tlefield) exhibited in the course of his remarks.
What is the excuse which the gentleman has
for his unusual and. I may say, unprecedented
course? What is his justification? He tried to
make the House believe that it is because we
are attempting to Impose a tax upon the peo
ple of Porto Rico, and also because, according
to the peculiar logic of this backwoods lawyer.
H8 he calls himself, this bill is unconstitu
tional.
Spoke for the Lumber Baron.
In the course of his remarks he told this
House that if this bill Is enacted into law the
spruce lumbermen of Maine, carrytne i their
lumber to Porto- Rico, would be obliged to. pay
a duty of ;iiÂ» cents a thousand on all the rough
lumber which they take to that Island. Who Is
it that is complaining of that tax of 50 cents
a thousand? Not the people of Porto Rico, but
the lumber barons of the State of Maine. That
is the reason why the gentleman is here, say
ing that he cannot agree with his party asso
ciates In imposing a duty upon American prod
ucts goina: to Porto Rico, wnen he knows that
every Collar of that duty Is paid over to the
people of that island for their benefit.
And if this theory, which he has always advo
cated, and which the Republicans have always
claimed to be correctâ if the theory that the
man who Imports pays the duty be correct â
then all of this tax upon the products going to
Porto Rico from the United States is paid by the
people of the United States. It is not. there
fore, the tax upon the people of Porto Rico that
constitutes his real objection, but because the
fishermen of New England and the spruce lum
bermen of Maine want to get their products
Into the ports of Porto Rico for 25 per cent of
the existing tariff on goods when Imported Into
the United States from foreign countries.
Powers (R.) of Vermont declared th;U
the acquisition of Porto Rico had brought
to the Island the same rights and privi
leges as arise In Arizona. New Mexico or
any of the other Territories. Brous3ard
(D.) of Louisiana opposed the bill and con
troverted the figures given by Payne par
ticularly In their reference to sugar an-1
rice. As to the latter article, he said,
Porto Rico afforded a large amount of the
American, product, which should bÂ« re
tained.
Defends Anti-Imperialists.
Thayer of Mississippi closed the day'a
speeches with an enerpetic protest agrairm
the attacks made on the anti-imperialists
as copperheads and traitors.
"We are not ashamed of the company
we keep." exclaimed Thayer. "In all mat
ters pertaining to the welfare of the coun
try, the prosperity of our people and- the
perpetuation of American institutions we
prefer the counsel and advice of Bout
well. Hoar. Hale and Fuller to that of
Hanna, Platt. Quay and Beverldge."
At 5 o'clock the House adjourned untlJ
Monday.

the Herds and Many Animals
Are Killed by Authorities. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Feb. 24.â A disease known
as infectious mammitis has become, preva
lent among dairy cattle. and some of the
milch cows of private families in this
county. The disease "Is of â¢ rare occur
rence and is particularly malignant. ThiÂ«
is its first appearance in this pan of the
country. The disease first showed itself
two days. ago In the herds of two dairies
supplying milk in this city. It spread
rapidly and already nearly half a hundred
cows are affected, says Dr.' Eddy.
The disease is a contagious inflamma
tion of the udder. It attacks the gland
duots and follicles,' causing deep-seated
swellings, which are often hard. It usual
ly affects the milch cows and may go
through an entire herd. Even if the cows
recover a portion of their udders are often
left in a diseased 'condition. The disease
is due to a septic germ and Is carried
from one cow to another by the milk
er's hands. â¢ Eruptions are present
upon the skin of the teat and udder and
the swelling Is very pronounced. There
are constitutional disturbances shown by
emaciation, languor and refusal to eat
food.' Â¦-Â¦ ' Â¦ -Â¦. -
Dr. Eddy has visited, two of the. dairies
where the cows are affected. Th<*
milk ffom the diseased cows, he said, had
a most disgusting odor. Several of the
cows had already begun to show signs
of mortification and they were ordered
killed.

Special TJispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â Secretary Pe
ter J. Shields of the State Board of Agri
culture has secured an Important conces
sion for the approaching State Fair. It
has happened for many years past that
the State Fairs of Washington and Ore-
Ron conflicted with the California Expo
sition, and the result was that many who
exhibited their stock and products in the
Northern States found themselves unable
to exhibit, in California at the same time.
Secretary Shields has convinced the pro
moters of the State Fairs of Washington
and Oregon that it is to the mutual inter
ests of tnemselves and California to- have
their fairs at varying dates. As a result
the Oregon society will hold its fair from
September 17 to 22 and the Washington
society, September 24 to 29. The Califor
nia State Fair will be held from Septem
ber 2to 15. Secretary Wisdom of the Ore
gon society writes that some of the choic

DANGER OF A

of Meat Bill.
EMBASSADORWHITE'SOPINION
?
ARMY ABUSES DISCUSSED IN
THE REICHSTAG.
?oraer Friends of the Boers in Ber
lin Are Gradually Drifting Over
to the Side of the
English.
Copyrighted, 1300, by tho Associated Press
BERLIN. Feb. 24.â The rereipt of news
from Washington intimating the cessa
tion of the commercial negotiations with
Germany has created a sensation here.
Andrew D. White, the United States Em-
Lassador. said to the correspondent of the
Associated Press:
"i interpret the reported "Washington
action as due to the most recent shape
of the meat inspection bill. If the bill
us adopted in its present shape, it will
cause a. bitter tariff war between the
United States and Germany, in which
I believe the latter will get. the
worst of it. The United States
could cause the greatest trouble
by opening every bottle of German wine
and investigating every stocking, etc. Of
course it would be a mere pretext, but it
would be no worse than they have done
â¢with our meat, which the world recog
nizes as excellent. The German Govern
ment officials already express satisfaction
with the American inspection and we
have never objected to another stringent
inspection here, if it is done {or sanitary
reasons, and not as a hindrance to trade.
I understand the German Government is
opposed to the present form of the bill."
Xo News of a Hitch.
The correspondent understood from a
member of the embassy that the Foreign
Office did not know the actual status of
the, negotiations in Washington and asked
the embassy a few days since for infor
mation on the subject. A responsible For
eign Office official said to the correspond
ent to-day: "I have no information re-
Eardir.c a hitch in the proceedings in
V ashington. but don't attach importance
to the latest news. The negotiations will
proceed in a conciliatory spirit, as here
tofore. Germany recognizes that some of
the United States agricultural products
are necessary for Germany, like cotton
and others. The American Government
at the commencement of the negotiations
was in favor of secrecy till dennite re
sults were reached. That was the only
reason for preserving silence here."
The Reichstag this week was engrossed
with army aliairs, Herr Bebel, me so
cialist leader, and a few others uncover*
ing a number of abuses which had hith
erto remained in the dark. The War Min
ister. General yon Gossler, replied length
ny and succeeded in explaining satisiac
turiiy most of the cases, though a few
o: trie worst remain. General yon Gossler
even had the courage to defend thfm,
tnough not a single party in tne Reicn
fc.ag sided with nim.
Debate on Army Duels.
Yon Gossler rather defended the army
duei ?fc an institution hallowed by tradi
tions and with ail its shortcomings the
best system to extend and preserve esprit
uÂ« corpse and the high standard of per
sona i honor in the army. He showed that
the number of dueis was steadily dimin
ishing and that th* same Is the case in
the numtK-r of soldiers committing sui
ciae because of cruel trtatment. A num
bei of center speakers strongly pro
nounctd themselves against duelling, Herr
Uestach putting a large part of the blame
upon the Emperor because the latter usu
ally pardons duellists who are sentenced
to short terms in a fortress for killing an
adversary often under peculiarly atro
cious circumstances, to seversfl of which
Herr Deshacn referred. While this de
bate succeeded in showing a reduction
the percentage of such abuses the general
impression nevertheless was that that the
army as a whole is in an enviable condi
tion," the officers being animated by the
best spirit. Nobody even hinted at corrup
tion end nobody showed evidence of favor
itism.
Sentiment Changing.
The German pre^s is now convinced that
the British have really defeated General
Cronje and that the latter's position is
desperate. Sympathies here remain on the
Boer side. Even Herr Eugene Richter,
the Radical leader, in an editorial speaks
admiringly of General Cronje's gallant re
sistance against a four-fold force. The
Nueste Nachrichten and many other pa
pers scold the British generals for the
;ack of chivalry shown to the enemy. It
is quite plain, however, that the current
<f German feeling is gradually butsteadiiy
changing in favor of Great Britain. The
fremi-ofticial press is exerting: itself to that
*-nd. and even the Kreuz Zeitung, the
iirmv and court organ, which until re
cently was Anglophot>e. now strongly
points out that it is to Germany's interest
to remain friendly with Great Britain.
The paper enumerates the reason why it
is impossible for the Germans to love the
British as a nation, especially after th<Â»ir
inimical neutrality in IM"4, 1866 and IS7U,
and the "consistent enmity" the British
Ijave shown Germany's colonial policy
and the rising German commerce. The
paper then says:
"Notwithstandlns; this. England's down
fall would m^an .a distinct disadvantage
to Germany in every part of the globe.
Therefore it is no part of German patriot
ism to uphold the cause of England's ene
mies."
Dr. Leydp. the diplomatic agent of the
Transvaal, writes from Brussels that he
will be unable to come to Berlin in the
middle of March. aÂ« he had promised,
â¢"because the prseent turn of the war" en
grosses him.
The German financial press points out
that the Russian loan to Persia liberates
the province of Farsisten. whose harbor
revenues have hitherto been pledged to
Great Erltain.

MISS OSTERMAN IN
A CLEVER SKETCH
THE few Indifferent acts that have
visited the Orpheum lately were
given short shrift by the manage
ment and the current bill is the bet
ter for the weeding.
Vaudeville has a decidedly ornamental
recruit in Kathryn Osterman, who ap
pears in a comedy sketch entitled "The
Editor," with a long, young man of a
peculiarly comedy sketch kind of clever
ness. His name is Thomas Tuther.
The motive of the sketch is to the fol
lowing effect: A youth who takes to him
self certain aspersions that are cast by a
newspaper upon the moral integrity of
an unnamed club man, provides himself
with pistols, boxing gloves and a rawhide
and starts out to thrash the editor. He
finds a lady in the sanctum, who takes
him for an expected cousin, and the com
plications that arise while she Is finding
out her mistake and he Is discovering
that she is the editor, whom he has
threatened either to shoot, slug, horse
whip or kick into repentance, are amus
ing in themselves and made more so by
Miss Osterman and t'other.
The sketch, however, Is more of wit
than action, and really gives Miss Oster
man no opportunity to do more than act
with a certain facility, Intelligence and a
sense of humor. She makes so much of
so little, however, that it would not sur
prise me to find her developing an artis
tic atmosphere of her own in some other
part. She does not laugh prettily.
Miss Osterman's act brfngs to an end
one of the best olios ever presented at
the Orpheum. De Witt and Burns supply
the acrobatic item and do stunts that
are not only original and grotesquely
comic but technically difficult. The ease
with which one of these agile fellows
promenades on his hands is amazing; he
makes it look so very simple, however,
that he gets less applause for it than
when he turns a twister. Technique lr.
athletics Is as little appreciated by the
average spectator as technique in music
is by the average auditor. A giant
swing and a high note will get an encore
every time when feats that call for much
greater skill are passed over in silence.
Fanny Fields is the other third of the
olio, and she is in a class by herself. She
dancea emphatically, sings humorously
and does what is still more difficult (for
a woman), monologizes cleverly. All this
with a German accent, even the dancing.
The rest of the programme Is standard.

CHEAP LIBRARY POSTAGE.
SOME time ago we directed attention to a
movement in the East having for its object the
enactment of a law providing for cheap postage
on books or pamphlets sent out by libraries for the
use of the reading public. The object is a good one,
and it is gratifying to note that a bill designed to at
tain it has been introduced by Senator Lodge and has
been favorably received.
According to reports from Washington the bill
provides for second class rates of postage on all books
or other printed matter passing to or from public
libraries maintained wholly or in part by taxation,
libraries belonging to educational institutions of all
grades, and society or social libraries enjoying ppurb r
lie privileges and maintained by "religious, literary,
professional, trade, industrial or library associations."
It will be seen the measure is sufficiently compre
hensive to grant the privilege of cheap postage on
books to every library of wide usefulness in the
country. If it be enacted it will largely benefit both
the libraries and the general public. By enabling
such institutions to circulate their books through the
mails, at a very little cost they can increase the num
ber of their patrons and the efficiency of their own
service. It will'be a great boon to readers who live
in small towns or in rural districts where there are
no public libraries, for it will give them almost as
excellent advantages in that respect as the residents
of cities.
There is of course an opposition to the measure.
It is well known the Government loses money on the
transportation of second class mail matter, and it is
argued that any increase in the amount of mail privi
lege to pass at second class rates would increase the
annual deficiency of the postoffice. The argument is
good, but there are better on the other side. In the
first place a very large proportion of the matter now
carried at second class rates should not be permitted
to remain in that class. It has been pointed out over
and over again that the privilege designed by Con
gress for the benefit of newspapers, magazines and
other legitimate periodicals has been taken advantage
of by advertising firms to. send circulars through the

OF CARNIVAL BALL
Promise of Attractive Pageant and
Beautiful Interior Decorations
at the Mark Hopkins
Institute of Art.
The Mardl Gras procession at the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art Tuesday evening
will be one of the most attractive
pageants ever formed by San Francisco
society. , The interior decorations of
the mansion, and notably those of the new
gallery and main hall, promise to render
the carnival event doubly enchanting.
Fifteen hundred palm branches, recently
received from Santa Barbara, enhance the
beauty of the seen*.
The demand for tickets of admission
and reserved places to view the spectacle
is active. All the boxes arranged for in
the original plan have been sold. It is
doubtful if other reservations can be
made. The house is large, however, henco
all the. spectators may be able to get a
fair view of the pageant.
Joseph D. Grant, president of the Art
Association, and . Kobert H. Fletcher,
curator of the Institute, have delegated
the responsibility of floor management to
Edward M. Greenway. After canvassing
several names Mr. Greenway appointed
an artist to represent Prince Carnival.
Half a dozen court Jesters may bo needed
to enliven the occasion with sallies of wit

For good and sufficient reasons Mr. GÂ«een
way deems Its wise to maintain secrecy
concerning certain features of the pro
cession. He has resolved, however, to
make the court and the court scene 3 at
tractive. The fact that he Is holding la
reserve Borne of the contemplated attrac
tions should not Imply that society will be
stunned by innovations. The assurance
given that lines of propriety are not to be
crossed will be respected. The floor man
ager perceives that the Â¦ patrons of the
carnival will not be satisfied with a mero
procession of dominoes and will therefore
offer something apart from the ordinary
fashion.
The names of nearly five hundred ladies

people is noted.
THE FINANCE BILL.
THE conference of the House and Senate has
agreed upon a finance measure, which is prac
tically the House bill, with the exception of the
bimetallic section. That section' reads: "That the
provisions of this act are not intended to preclude the
accomplishment of international bimetallism when
ever conditions shall make it expedient and prac
ticable to secure the same by concurrent action of the
leading commercial nations of the world, and at a
ratio which shall insure permanence of relative value
between gold and silver."
The body of the act is so wise and timely and so
fully responds to the sound money sentiment of the
country, as far as it goes, that this section, unwise as
it is, will but little hamper the satisfaction that will be
felt that a settlement of the whole problem is so
nearly completed.
The contention of this country for international
bimetallism has never met with a hospitable response
abroad, and there is no prospect that it ever will. Nor
is there any fact in scientific finance that affirms the
utility or desirability -of such a system, if its institu
tion were possible. There is no evidence that any
agreement, no matter how general, nor between any
number of nations, can maintain parity between two
such forms of personal property, as gold and silver.
Their value is in their utility as determined by human
desire, which is the sole origin of all value.
However, this small fly in the measure will not ob
scure its other merits. It establishes the. gold stan
dard, the payment in that standard of all national ob
ligations, and plants thereon the credit of the republic.
It provides for cutting the endless chain, anti makes
less possible the depletion of the treasury stock of
gold by the sinister use of the greenbacks in redemp
tion, and it safeguards a gold reserve of $150,000,000,
establishing in law that reserve, which has heretofore
existed in a custom of the treasury. The national
bank issues are permitted to equalthe par value of
the funds deposited to secure them. In other respects
the national banking system is properly left to be the
subject of future legislation, which the sound, money
organizations of the country have in prospect and
preparation.
The returns from the Philippines of late have been
mostly dead bodies of heroes, and it is to be noted
that they were killed, not by Aguinaldo, but by the
climate. We may run Aguinaldo out, but the climate
will stay with us, and its deadly work will go on as
long as we are foolish enough to send brave men
there to die.

CRONJE AT BAY.
RARELY in the annals of war has there c"ver been
a feat of arms so brilliant, and never has there
been one more courageous or more heroic,
than that which the world is now watching as Cronje
with his little band of Boers stands at bay and holds
back the advance of a British army led by the ablest
generals of the empire and flushed with an almost
certain hope of final victory, Â«
The three Romans of the brave days of old who
upon a bridge across the Tiber held back a host of
fees until their countrymen hewed down the supports
of the bridge behind them did not accomplish a
greater marvel of personal bravery and devotion than
that which is now being achieved by the patriots of
South Africa. Neither was the Spartan stand at
Thermopylae more brilliant in its daring or more use
ful to the cause in which the sacrifice was made. It is
not no A" as it was in those days, a hand to hand con
test with swords and battle-axes, but the courage re
quired to meet an overwhelming foe face to face in
the old times was not greater than that which uphok'i
the Boers in maintaining the ground the enemy is
sweeping with the most destructive fire that modern
engir.es of war can pour forth.
A week has passed since Cronje, after a night march
which was itself one of the military marvels of the
time, found himself so pressed by his foes that fur
ther retreat was impossible. Since last Sunday h*
has held his position, and, despite the heavy odds
against him, he has not been shaken in it. His foes
outnumber him five to one, and the ardent Roberts
snd the forceful Kitchener urge them on, but at
every successive charge he beats them back, and then
waits with undiminished fortitude under the bom
bardment of artillery for another attack to come.
The defense is not one of desperation merely. The
heroic Boer is not fighting blindly through a mere
hist of battle and a stubborn resolve to die rather
than to surrender. Every day of delay in the advance
of the British is an immense gain to the cause of the
Afrikanders. It gives an opportunity for the artillery
of their army to be carried to a place of safety and
for reinforcements to hasten from all quarters to the
defense of Orange Free State. In its strategic effect,
therefore, the action of Cronje is much the same as
that of Horatius and his two companions in holding
the bridge at Rome. It checks the onrushing victors
and gives time for the scattered forces of the Boers
to rally and save the campaign.
Out of even' war for liberty there comes some illus
trious deed which serves for all future ages as an in
spiration to patriots. In this war there may be many
such deeds, but it is not likely that any will ever sur
pass this in the magnitude of forces engaged, the emi
nence of the generals in command, or in the impor
tance of its issues. Every feature of the situation
tends to thrill the minds of those who have followed
the news of the unequal straggle day after day.
Cronje has, in fact, already achieved a true victory.
He may be eventually crushed and captured, if not
killed, but his long fight has given his countrymen
cne more chance. Whatever may come hereafter, on
his brow the laurels of honor will not fade, nor will
his deed be forgotten while patriotism and military
valor are esteemed among men.
NO TACIT CONSENT.
ATTORNEY DORN'S statement to the Police
Committee of the Board of .Supervisors that
the silence of the press on the subject of the
proposed reopening of racetrack gambling at Ingle
side gives a tacit consent to the project serves the
public as a timely warning of the danger and recalls
them to action. It is safe to say from this time forth
there will be no lack of protests against the iniquity.
Neither the press, the pulpit, the civic organizations
nor the general mass of citizens will permit it to be
said that while the gamblers pushed forward their
scheme they stood by in silence and thus gave a tacit
consent to it.
The Police Committee has instructed Attorney
Dorn to prepare such an ordinance as he desires for
his clients and submit it for consideration at the next
meeting of the committee. Attorney Drum, who
champions the cause of the proprietors of poolrooms,
was at the same time requested to prepare such an
ordinance as his clients desire. Thus the gamblers
are to have the initiative in preparing legislation for
the city. The Police Committee has given it to
them, and we shall see what they will do with it. In
the meantime the people will make ready to deal with
the results of it as they deserve.
That any considerable number of respectable per
sons in San Francisco should be willing to grant a
new license for the racetrack gamblers is not credible.
The experience of the past has been a sufficient warn
ing. The enticements of the gamblers lured men and
boys and women to ruin. While the gamblers them
selves live at the best hotels, drink the finest of wines
and wear rich garments, the victims of their allure
ments are some of them fugitives from the law, some
are in dire poverty and some are in the grave, for
murder and suicide were a part of the effects of the
racetrack curse.
There is hardly any class of society that was not
more or less affected by the open gambling at the
track or the downtown poolrooms. The blight was
far-reaching. Confidential clerks in high positions
were led to embezzlement, city officials defaulted in
the trust imposed in them, women of good families
gambled away the earnings of their husbands, and
youths who were but little more than boys were
tempted to petty thefts by the gamblers who, driven
cut of Eastern cities, had come to California to carry
on their nefarious trade.
It is in the light of that past experience we con
front the issue a second time. Ample evidence is af
forded that the public is already aroused to renew the
fight for morality and the public welfare, and Attor
ney Dorn will never again have the assurance to de
clare to the Supervisors that the silence of the press
has given the consent of the public to the gambling
scheme.
In the current number of the Forum Senator
Marion Butler advances many facts to prove that the
Populist party is still alive, and had he taken note of
the force with which some of them in Nebraska are
protesting against the way the Bryanites treated them
he could have added evidence that they are still kick
ing.
mails under the pretense that they are newspapers;
and the publishers of cheap novels send thousands of
their comparatively worthless books through the
mails at second class rates 'under the disguise of a
"monthly library." Were these and other abuses
stopped the Government could well afford to extend
to the libraries of the country the privilege now
sought for.
The people of the United States constitute the
greatest reading public in the world. Our cultured
classes are not confined to cities and towns of suffi
cient sUe to maintain a library of high rank. Thou
sands who live in sparsely settled communities are
as eager to read as arc those who live in the centers
of population. That much has been abundantly
proven by the success which has attended the system
of traveling libraries wherever it has been adopted.
It is nothing more than right that the Government
should co-operate with the libraries in furnishing
books to supply the needs of that class of the popu
lation. The bill of Senator Lodge is a move in the
right direction and merits the support of all who have
a due regard for public welfare.

IS THE PARTY BUCKED AND
GAGGED?
THE committee consisting of Republican mem
bers of Congress, which is especially charged
with watchfulness of the Congressional dis
tricts, and of the party nominations therein, mindful
of the mighty interests at stake in the campaign, has
very properly announced its desire for early nomi
nations in all the Congressional districts. The can
didate for Congress in each district becomes at once
the party leader and champion therein. When he is
chosen the plan of campaign appears and the ener
gies of the organization are at once in action and or
ganized for the direction of issues and the education
of the people.
This most proper policy and action of the Con
gressional committee make highly necessary imme
diate action by party authority throughout the Union.
Especially is this the case in California. .All public
men in this State are aware of the peculiar nature of
its politics, which inheres in the independent spirit
of our people. They swing away from repellent per
sonal forces in either party and administer, with a
hard fist, rebukes to bossism and personal dictation.
This being true, now is the time of times when the
Republican party of California should refuse to be
bucked and gagged by its merely ministerial represen
tative, the State Committee. It is believed that
Colonel Burns proposes to exploit his boss control of
party affairs by holding the State Committee subject
to his will, his movements and his personal whim and
convenience. The month of March is upon us. The
boss is said to have locked up the State Committee
and has carried the key in his pocket to Mexico, with
directions that no one shall break the lock and re
lease the energies of the party until his return!
Therefore Republicans are expected to stew in their
own juice until such time as the boss shall dictate.
If such action were freely decided on, as the deliber
ate act of the majority of the committee, it would be
a serious tactical mistake. But when there is ap
parent no recorded judgment of the committee to
that effect, when it has not met and voted upon sus
pension or release of the party activities, the decision
being that of a mere dictatorial boss, the action pro
jects its offensive and disastrous effect into the com
ing campaign to inflame a resentment that will wreak
itself in the ballot box, if it have no other means of
expression.
Republicans who value their party are longing with
especial anxiety for its success in California this year.
Look where you will in the other States and there is a
condition of activity. Organization is being, pushed,
the captains of tens and the captains of hundreds are
rallying their forces, and vitality vibrates throughout
the party. Here it is said, to the humiliation of Re
publican voters, that the party has gone to Mexico
and may return in April and tell them what to do!
It is an insufferable and an intolerable condition.
The State Committee should at once mobilize the
forces of the party. It should project activity and in
fuse life into every Congressional district. Its
purely ministerial functions should be at otice as
sumed, not to intrigue for the nomination of its fa
vorites, but to equip the party for the election of
candidates freely chosen by the people. The election
of Senator Bard elevated the self-respect and height
ened the pride of Republicans throughout the State.
It forced praise from the opposition. It had in it the
trumpet call to action and the impulse and thrill. of
victory. It should be followed up, immediately, by
the setting of every squadron in the field The min
isterial representative of the party, its State Com
mittee, must not take on the appearance of sulking
in its tent. It must not appear to be disgruntled be
cause it nominated a Senatorial candidate that was
rejected by the party. Its hand has no business to
appear at all in the interest of any candidate. Its duty
is simply to furnish the facilities and opportunity of
action by the party. The present position of this"
ministerial agent of the party is not in line with party
interest and success if it be true that it has retired to
its pillow to sleep until it is roused by a boss.
We call upon all Republicans who desire success,
who believe that public and party interests are inter
locked, to call on the committee for action, for organ
ization, for activity in line with the expectations of
the Congressional committee, and tending to that
victory which is more essential now than ever before
since the Republican sentiment of the Union was or
ganized for a great purpose and equipped for the
mighty deeds which have made the history of the
country the history of the party for the last forty
four years."

WANT CONTRACTS INTACT.
Builders' Association Declares Agfinst
the Segregation, of Work.
The Builders' Association of California
has addressed a communication to the
architects throughout the State declaring
against "the evil effects of the segrega
tion of contracts." In part it is as follows:
Segregation of contracts undoubtedly
ia an evil that not only prolongs build
ing operations but makes them more
costly than under a single contractor's
supervision. To allow segregation to go
beyond the limit we have permitted in
the last few years means simply that
we in time will be aaked to furnish
labor and labor alone on your build
ings The demoralisation that â¢ will
surely follow such conditions in the
building business is undoubtedly ap
parent to us all; and though we do not
choose to say we will or will not do
certain thinga. we desire to call your
attention and solicit your considera
tion to possibilities that we believe in
your power to avert. We do this In
view of notices which have been sent
you by master plasterers and concrete
men desiring that their manifestos
may neither discredit us nor coerce
you. In conclusion, we wish to say
that we stand now better prepared
than in the past to enter into and
carry out our contracts as a whole.
The sale still on â we haven't
begun to exhaust our low
prices. New lot this week.

Sixteeeth Street, From Mission to Capp.
THREE ACRES OF SALES SPACE, PRACTICALLY ALL ON TWO IMMENSE FLOORS.
AND OUR WELCOME IS AS BIG AS THE STORE!
The expansion was no experiment, the growth being natural and
logical. Large operations, either in selling or manufacturing, make wise
economy possible, hence the continual growth of this concern.
Large sales and manufacturing nearly all our own furniture help us
sell goods cheaper. To charge high prices, would be a blunder, and we
could not have grown on a blundering policy.
This mammoth business has come to us through deserving it,
because our methods opened a new vista of possibilities in the selling
of housefurnishings.
It is not in boasting that we say we sell more Furniture, Carpets and
Curtains than are sold by any other store conducting business on similar
plans in California. Think it over?
BUYERS OF FURNITURE ARE PROTECTED I
Firstâ ln the responsibility of this house.
Secondâ ln the excellence of the goods sold.
Thirdâ ln the absolute certainty that the prices are lowest.
Our methods of doing business have been a great convenience to
city and country buyers alike.
We have brought manufacturers and buyers closer together, and
for our pains are often accused by our competitors of ruining the
furniture business of San Francisco.
But the furniture business isn't being ruined. It may be finding its
truer level, and it's surely finding its one headquartersâ PATTOSlEN'S.

RANCHER MARSHALL'S
PUMP GUN IN COURT
Thrown Into Jail for Killing Blue
jay and Quail With a Gun
That Couldn't Fall.
Testimony was taken yesterday In the
"United States Circuit Court by Judge Gil
bert in the matter of the habeas corpus
petition on behalf of W. A. Marshall, a
wealthy resident ol Slarin County, con
victed of having used a rep-eating shotgun
Jn kiillr.g quail and bluejaysâ one of tich
â on hl3 own land and with his own
pump gun, contrary to an ordinance of
the Board of Supervisors of that county
prohibiting the use of such weapons.
Mr. Marshall's attorney contended that
the ordinance was in conflict with the
fourteenth amendment to the constitu
tion of the United States and that the
ordinance was unreasonable for many
rf&sons. one of them being that a
"pump" gna was no more destructive to
pame than was a double-barreled shot

VROOMAN ACT
CONSTITUTIONAL
Important Decision by
Judge Torrence.
WILL BEAR ON MANY CASES
?
LITIGANTS ENTITLED TO APPLY
FOR DEEDS.
â ?
Differs From the Ohio Law De
clared Unconstitutional
by the Federal
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 24.â 1n a decision on
a demurrer to-day In the Superior Court
Judge Torrence practically decided the
case of J. Goldtree against John D.
Spreckels in favor of the defendant, leav
ing the plaintiff nothing on which to stand
in court. The suit was brought to re
strain the defendant from applying to the
Treasurer of Coronado for a tax deed to
a lot of the plaintiff previously sold for a
delinquent street assessment tax levied
against the lot for the grading, paving
and sidewalking of Orange avenue. The
principal contention made by plaintiff's
counsel waa that the street Improvement
law of this State commonly known as the
Vrooman act was unconstitutional, and
therefore that all the proceedings under
which the improvement of Orange avenue
was made were void.
Federal Court Quoted.
In support of the claim that the Vroo
man act was unconstitutional tho plaintiff
pleaded that the decision of the Federal
court in the case of Norwood vs. Baker
declares that the street laws, such as the
Vrooman act, are unconstitutional in that
it said that the only principle which jus
tified the levying of special assessments
on private property for street improve
ments was based on the assumption that
the property assessed was specially bene
fited to the extent of the assessment made
upon it, and where a statute prescribed
an arbitrary rule of assessment without
regard to the question whether the prop
erty assessed would be benefited
or not, that such a statute was
invalid as contravening the clause
of the Federal constitution. The
Norwood-Baker decision has practically
stopped street work throughout the State
which had been going on entirely under
the provisions of the Vrooman act. It waa
under the permission of this same Vroo
man act that the defendant was about to
acquire title to the lots in dispute.*
Judge Torrence, however, holds that
the Vrooman act is entirely dissimilar to
the Ohio State law, that the Federal de
cision does not touch it, that the Legis
lature of this State had in view the prin
ciple that special assessments can only be
levied to the extent of special benefits and
that the State Legislature intended thai
the legislative bodies of the different
municipalities of the State should be gov
erned by that principle, and, in ordering
street improvements and levying assess
ments therefor should only do so when
it appeared to them that the special as
sessments would not exceed "the special
benefits accruing to the property assess
ed and therefore that the decision in the
Norwood case did not apply to the Vroo
man act. He also holds that the Vroo
man act elves the lot-holder the oppor
tunity to be heard, which the Ohio law
does not give, and which was one of the
principal reasons why the Ohio law wus
not upheld.
Differs From Ohio Law.
The Judge, asserts that the very de
cision of tne Federal Court knocking out
the Ohio law Is a strong support of the
view that tho Vrooman, or California law
would not be knocked out by the same
tribunal. He therefore holds that the law
is constitutional and that Mr. Spreckels
is entitled under it to apply for the deed
to the property. The opinion delivered
by Judge Torrence practically determines
the merits of the case and also a number
of other casea of like character pending
In his department.
This decision is a very Important one
and if upheld by the higher courts will
sustain the validity of numerous titles to
real estate which depend for their validity
upon the constitutionality of the Vroomaa
act.
Benson took him to his room at 783^

next morning Aldridge had disappeared,
together with Benson's gold -watch, chain
and locket. $3 50 In coin and a pair of tan

day night by Detectives Ryan and ODea
he was wearing the stolen shoes. About
two months ago Aldridge was arrested
for disturbing the peace and made such
a strong talk to Judge Mogan about be

Judge allowed him to go.
BIG TRAINED ANIMAL
SHOW SOON TO ARRIVE
Norris & Rowe'3 Aggregation Â£n
Route to This City With Beasts
of Every Description.
On Saturday afternoon next Norris &
Rowe's big trained animal show will be
gin a sixteen days' engagement in this
city at the Mechanics' Pavilion and will
give performances at 2:30 and S p. m.
throughout the engagement. A grand free
illuminated parade will be held on Friday
night at 8 o'clock. In which the 300 ani
mals connected with the show will parti
cipate. The collection of animals is said
to be the largest In the world. It includes
elephants, dogs, monkeys, zebras, goats,
Shetland ponies and zebus.
"The elephant men have to mind their
charges every hour of the day and night,"
said Professor Norris. "The bull, to use
circus slang, sleeps only about two hours
out of the twenty-four, and often does
that on his feet. Some African elephants
have been known to go weeks without
sleep. The elephant is always fidgeting
about, swaying that ridiculous hulk of his
and always stlrrinK up strife and picking
at sometnlng with his trunk. He must
have something to occupy his mind, and
so bales of hay are always at hand to be
doled out to him. He must be always
scolded and talked to and told to keep out
of that or get back there or come out
where he can be seen. Ordinarily, when
not talked to, most elephant men divert
themselves by rapping the bull on the
proboscis with the elephant hook.
"An elephant has a hide about an inch
thick, a temper that is as uncertain as
the toss of a coin, the cruelty of an
Apache and the destructiveness of a tor
nado. Our Fargo's. small elephant bump
of destructiveness Is fully developed. He
Is continually pulling the bell rope while
we are in transit and stopping the train,
breaking the cages and generally destroy
ing property, but notwithstanding that he
is a particularly good and gentle speci
men.
"It is a well known fact that the ani
mals around our show are ruled by love,
the whip being seldom employed, but tc.
make an elephant mind without the use
of the 'bull hook' would be as futile as
an attempt to stop a Kansas cyclone with
a feather duster. The 'bull hook' Is
shaped like a boat hook. It has a straight
point, which Is used to jab In where the
skin is tenderest. Elephants, like most
animals, are cowards and will only take
advantage of a trainer or keeper when
they are not looking. They will occasion
ally make a 'bluff' as if to strike, but
when prodded gently with the 'bull nook'
they will whine so you can locate the
very spot It comes from, which Is not un
like the last pedal key of a church or
gan. It often sounds like an amateur
trying to blow a cornet for the . first
time. They treasure up grievances
against a trainer ,or keeper and
usually 'get' their man every time. They
are treacherous at their best, and one has
to keep an eagle eye out for them at all
times.'

A loan of J157.000 was made this week
by the estate of A. C. Whltcomb to the
Odd Fellows' Hall Association on the
property on the south corner of Market
and Seventh streets. The association, had
been paying 6M and 6 per cent on the loan,
which Is not only one for a large amount
but Is secured by realty of the first class.
It was enabled, however, by going to pri
vate capital, to borrow for s*^ per cent,
with the privilege of paying off a portion
of the indebtedness every year or the en
tire amount at the end of three years.
These are very advantageous terms for
the borrower, which were rendered pos
sible because private capital is not bound
down to a fixed rate of interest without
regard to the locality, the character of
the security and the size of the sum to be
loaned.
; The savings banks, building associations
and private capitalists of this city loaned
an aggegregate of $455,750 upon local real
estate for the week ending February 17,
against $271,235 for the previous week. The
loans of the savings banks last week
amounted to $419,420, and were as follows:
Hibernia. $286,820; German. $21,750: San
Francisco Savings Union, $15,700; Savings
and Loan. $4700; Humboldt. $61,000; Mutuai.
$18,350, and French. $1100. The building as
sociations loaned $1500 and private capital
ists and others loaned $64,860. Among the
large loans last week was one of $132,903 by
the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society at
6 per cent, which is the rate accepted for
all loans by that bank. The same bank
also made three other large loans of $03,
500, $13,000 and $10,000, respectively. The
Humboldt Savings and Loan made one
loan of $18,500, one of $16,000 and one of
$15,000. The releases of the week were un
precedentedly large, amounting to $3,934
215. Quite a number of releases on tho
Blythe-Hinckley property are included in
the above total. These alone aggregate
$2 654.995. There were also some other laiÂ«e
releases growing out of the same litiga
tion.
Eleven new building contracts aggregat
ing $41,359 were filed for record during tho

If the machine bought of you had proven satisfactory, that you wished me to jrivo
you a slight testimonial in regard to Its merits, etc., which I am more than plea^e-J
to do.
Will state that I purchased one of the Moore Gold Separators with Rotary
Amalgamator attached, and I can truthfully fay that It has proven all that, nm
claimed for It in every respectâ a thorough gold saver for either fine or coarse go!J
and works all kinds of gravel successfully, takes but little water, a one-Inch forca
pump supplying machine, one horse-power to run it. Is strong and durable, with
little wear and no breakage, can- handle three to four tons per hour.
My gravel had some clay In it and runs from $1 50 to <10 per ton, and machira
works if all right and tailings show but a trace of gold, seldom any. and can say
to those thlnklr.g of buying a machine, you can make no mistake, as they are a
positive gold saver, and for fine gold or for a place wh"re water is scarce they are
beyond comparison. Yours faithfully. (Signed) H. G. WHITTLE.
A corporation Is about to be organized for thÂ« purpose of installing a plant at
Cape Nome, which will be called "The Moore Gold Separator Sub-Company No. L"
This company will control a plant to be installed at Cap*> Nome as follows:
A power /ilant consisting of twenty machines, which will have a capacity of
working from 7000 to 10.000 tons of sand or gravel daily. The company will Â«?so
own and control twenty hand-power machines for working the beach sands. ThÂ«Â»
capacity of the twenty "hand machines will be from 800 to 1000 tons dally.
The capital of the sub-company to be immediately organizfd will be IW.COO
shares, par value $1 per share. For the purpose of installing this plant at Capo
Nome we off-er to the public 10,000 shares of the treasury stock at par. $1 per share.
reserving the right to reject any or all subscriptions. Â»r to allot a subscriber a pro
rata cf stock when over-subscribed. No subscription* will be accepted for less
than 100 shares, for $100. Subscriptions to the first installment of treasury stock r.f
10,000 shares will be received at the company's office, room IS, Crocker building, ua
and after Monday, February 26. until otherwise ordered.
The company have the option of several claims at Cape Nome, which will be
carefully prospected in order fo-detTinlrie where best to locate this power plan*,
on the arrival of the plant at Capf: Nome.
Figuring the capacity of the power plant at â¬000 tons daily, it will be seen that
sand or gravel having only Â£> per Â»on value recovered will prove a blg-pavlns
proposition. One day's run on the valuÂ«; of $3 per ton would pay for labor and aÂ»l
operating experses and 25 per cent on the stock at $1 per share.
We have met a large number of nilners and business men from the Cape Nomo
district, and taking a very conservative view of values as stated by these miners
and business men we think we are safe In estimating the values of the beach sand
or the sand or gravel from the bench or creek claims at $10 per ton.
By the use of conveyers to convey the gravel from the ground to the machines
we estimate that the entire cost of handling the gravel and attending to the power
plant would be covered at $1 per ton, and all values above $1 per ton recovered will
be a net profit to the company. It will require no very great mathematician tJ
realize the large profits that may be derived from a plant of this capacity in a run
of 100 days. â¢
One great advantage of installing these machines beyond the saving qualitl*^.
which have been fully demonstrate 1. la the small quantity of water required for
each machine. Less than two mlner'fe inches of flowing water will supply a ma-
chine which will work from 300 to SOU tons of sand or gravel daily, and will Â«aye
at least 40 per cent more fine gold than can be saved in a rocker or a sluice box.
This is conceded by experimental work on sand already put through the machine
at No. 69 Stevenson streetâ that at lÂ»ast 40 per cent of the values which are recov-
ered in this machine cannot be saved in a sluice box or rocker.
We feel justified In making this :;tatement, that this sub-company, controlling
twenty power machines and twenty nand machines, will pay on an Investment of
$100 not less than $1000 for the coming: season, and will leave a large surplus In th*Â»
treasury of the company, which can be applied to increase the plant for another
season to a very much larger earning capacity. This statement can be verified by
hundreds of practical mining men whe nave witnessed the perfect working of Â«r.a
machine and its gold-saving qualities.
Through the investment of this company people who cannot visit Cape Nome
can derive some of the benefits from the vast wealth which certainly exists in
that section of the country. Although the profits are large, the statements whien
are made herein are deducted from a most conservative standpoint, which we will
challenge any disinterested mining man to honestly question.

BRILLIANT WEDDING
OF SOCIETY FAVORITES
With Splendid Ceremony Lilian
Pauncefote Is Made me Wife
of Robert Bromley.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24.â Th^ Honor
able Lillian Pauncefote, dafthter of
Lord Pauncefote, British Embassador to
the United States, was married at noon
to-day to Hon. Robert Bromley of Stoke
Hall. The wedding was one of the most
notable that has occurred in Washington
for many years. Quaint old St. John's
Church, where the ceremony was per
formed, has a capacity for about 800.
standing room included, and this did not
serve to accommodate a tithe of those
who wished to witness the ceremony. â¢
The Interior of the little church was
like the corolla of a huge flower. The
brilliantly lighted altar in the depths
of the darkened auditorium, with its
golden points and snowy candles, formed
the stamens and pistil, while the flower
encrusted walls and pillars, through
which the crimson hangings scarcely
showed, were like the petals of a mon
ster blossom. *
The air was heavy with the scent of
Easter lilies, bride's roses and orange
blossoms, mingling with the odor of lilies
of the valley and carnations. Palms filled
all the available space within the chan
cel, while broad white ribbons stretching
down the aisles were dropped by the ush
ers, link by link, as the pews filled with
the distinguished guests. The ushers
were all attaches of . the embassy.
Colonel Arthur Lee, Gerard Lowther. Sir
Charles Elliott, Max Muller and Hum
phreys Owen.
The bride, to the great uneasiness of
her friends, had been quite sick all week
and leaned heavily on the arm of her
father as the procession moved down
the aisle. Her wedding gown was a full
court costume of white satin, the front a.
gleaming network of lace and pearls,
while masses of laces, caught with
orange blossoms, edged the long court
train from the shoulders to the floor.
A pretty feature of the bride's attend
ants were Master Sidney Kent Leger in
the costume of a page. of Charles 11. He.
bore the heavy train and was followed
by the bridesmaids. These were Miss Es
ther Bromley, sister of the groom; Miss
Curzon, cousin of Lord Curzon. the Vice
roy of India; Miss Hettie Sargent of
Boston. Hon. Sibyl and Hon. Audrey
Pauncefote, sisters of the bride.
After the ceremony a wedding break
fast-was served at the embassy to 400
guests. Mr. and Mrs. Bromley later left
for 'Palm Beach, Fla., and will soon re
turn to England, where the young matron
will be presented at court.
Among the distinguished guests were:
The Secretary of State and Mrs. Hay. the
Misses Hay. Secretary and Mrs. Root.
Secretary and Mrs. Hitchcock, the Misses
Hitchcock. Postmaster General and Mrs.
Smith, Miss Wilson, daughter of the Sec
retary of Agriculture; the German and
Mexican Embassadors, the latter accom
panied by Mrs. Aspiros and Mrs. Perez:
the Count Cassini. Miss Cassinl. the
Guatemalan Minister, the Haytien Minis

with a heart shaped brooch.
Mrs. Oornellus Vanderbilt and Miss
Gladys Vanderbilt gave a handsome gold
repousse paper case and portfolio; Com
mander and Mrs. Cowles, the latter a sis
ter of Governor Roosevelt, a Dutch re
pousse silver box. . .
Mr. Curzon and his daughter. Miss Cur
zon of England, gave the duplicate of the

four years ago to take charge of the den
tal rooms of a department store com
pany. He had been a dentist well known
in Chicago, and when he left there he
placed his ofllce in charge of Dr. Cald
well, who did the shooting to-night. Mrs.
Hayes did not come to the city with her
husband, but remained in Chicago for
some timeâ just how long is not known.
Four, weeks ago, when Hayes opened an
office in the Hotel Endicott, Caldwell
was placed there as assistant. The Hayes
family occupied, with thr; office, a set of
apartments on the ground floor of the
hotel. With them lived Dr. .Caldwell,
Ralph Haves, a nephew of Dr. Hayes,
and a colored maid. Mrs. Hayes was 35
years of age. Dr. Caldwell was the same
age. i
To-night, after dinner. Dr. Hayes and
his nephew went out. Mrs. Hayes direct
ed the servant to attend to her work in
the kitchen, at the same time saying that
she would change her dinner gown for a
house dress. Within a half hour Dr.
Hayes' nephew* returned and, as the ser
vant opened the door to admit him, there
came the sound of two pistol shots. Two
more shots x were fired a moment later.
The young man and several others who
had heard the shots ran Into Mrs. Hayes"
apartments.
On the bed lay Mrs. Hayes. . She had
thrown off the dress she had worn at din
ner. She lay in a natural position. There
were two ragged wounds in her right tem
ple, from which . the blood flowed. The
bullets had entered her brain and she
must have died instantly. Beside the bed
lay Dr. Caldwell. He. too, waa dead
There were two bullet wounds In his
head. His right hand still clutched a re
volver, the finger on the trigger, show
ing how he had died.
Dr. Hayes was found in a drug store
near at hand and hurried to the rooms.
He was quite distracted, talked wildly and
It was feared for a time thathe would
have to be restrained. He- could not of
fer the faintest suggestion of a cause for
the wild act of Caldwell.
The police could learn but little. Dr
Hayes, from being excited and talkative
cooled down and refused to say anything'
The colored maid was so frightened that
not a word could be had from her.
Nothing was found that gave any idea
as to the cause of the shooting, so far as
is known or so far as any one would say.
Everything indicated. that Dr. Caldwell
had followed Mrs. Hayes into the bed
room almost immediately. She had only
partly removed her bodice. Apparently
she had been standing with her back to
the bed when he fired upon her. and she
fell backward upon it. Then there was
an interval of a few seconds. Evidently
Dr. Caldwell paused a few moments to
make sure his shots were fatal. Then
he turned the weapon upon himself

Persons who know the Hayes couple
and Caldwell gay that * Dr. Hayos
had for years befriended- Caldwell and
had given him an opportunity to
advance in his profession: In fact,
had considered him almost as one
of his own family. As a. result of this
treatment Caldwell became enamored of
Mrs. Hayes, and; it seems, after many
repulses, decided if he could not win the

OXYGEN EXTRACTED
FROM LIQUID AIR
NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â At a dinner piven
at the Players' Club to-night 'to Raoul
Pictet, the Swiss scientist, oxygen was
produced from air by a secret process
used for the first time in this country.
The demonstration was made in the pres
ence of M. Bruwaert. the French Consul
General: Edward Sumner, who represent
ed Sir Thomas Upton, and a lawyer con
nected with the General Liquid Air Com
pany. For the experiment a simple ap
paratus consisting mainly of copper tubes,
was used. Atmospheric air was taken In
at one end and at the other oxygen was
shown by the production of a calcium
light from the ignition of the gas. Liquid
air was employed in the process.
Mr. Pictet asserts that with a five hun
dred horsepower plant . he can produce
daily 500.000 cubic feet of oxygen. 1,000.001/
cubic feet of nitrogen and 1000 cubic feet
of carbonic acid gas. The last named
product will, it is said, pay for the cost
of the entire production and the oxygen
and nitrogen will represent the net profits.
As 2000 cubic f^-et of oxygen is estimated
to be' equal in heating power to a ton of
coal, the process is considered to be of
great value from a commercial stand
point.

Cold Wave Strikes Chicago.
CHICAGO. Feb. 24.â The coldest weather
of the year was experienced In Chicag,"o
to-night. Before midnight the mercury,
which began dropping in the afternoon,
after having risen seven degrees since
daylight, fell to 10 degrees below zero, and
this low temperature was accompanied by
a brisk northeast wind. While the force
of the wind was felt keenly even in the
sheltered downtown section, it was in the
suburban districts that the cold wave was
hardest to endure. ......

THE WHOLE SECRET
Cf the Remarkable Success of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
Stomach Trouble.
A new remedy which may revolutionize
the treatment cf stomach troubles has
been placed before the public and bears
the endorsement of many leading physi-
cians and scientific men.
This preparation is not a wonderful dis-
covery nor yet a secret patent medicine,
neither is it claimed to cure anything ex-
cept dyspepsia, indigestion ar.d stomach
troubles, with which nine-tenths of our
nation are more or less affected.
The remedy is in the form of pleasant-
tasting tablets cr lozenges containing
vegeiabJe and fruit essences, pure aseptic
pepsin (free from animal impurities).
Gclden Seal and diastase. They are sold
by dniFÂ£ists under the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Many interesting experiments made
with those tablets show that they possess
remarkable digestive power, one grain of
the active principle In one of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets being sufficient to
thoroughly digest 30<XÂ» grains of lean meat,
eggs, oatmral or similar wholesome food.
Stuart's Tablets do not act upon the
bowels like after-dinner pills and cheap
cathartics, which simply irritate and in-
Same the intestines, without having any
effect whatever in curing Indigestion.
If the stomach can be rested and as-
rifted in the work of digestion it will very
Foon recover Its normal vigor, as no or-
pan is ro much abused and overworked as
the stomach. This is the secret and the
whole secret of the remarkable succesa
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
practically unknown a few years ago
and now the most popular, safest and
most widely sold of any treatment for
ftomach weakness.
This success has been secured entirely
upon its merits as a digestive, pure and
FimpJe; because there can be no stomach
trouble if the food is promptly digested.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entirely
Â¦upon the food eaten, digesting it com-
pletely, so that it can be assimilated into
blood, nerve and tissue.
Every drop of blood, every bone, nerve
er.d tissue in the body can be renewed
In but one way, and that Is from whole-
tome food properly digested. There is no
other way. ar.d the idea that a medicine
in itself can purify the blood or supply
rew tissues and strong nerves Is ridicu-
lous and on a par with the fol-de-rol that
dyspepsia is a germ disease or that other
fallacyâ that a weak stomach which re-
fuses to digest food can be made to do
fo by irritating and inflaming the bowels
by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure dyspep-
ria, water brash, sour stomach, catarrh
of the Ftomach, gas and bloating: after
meals, because they furnish the diges-
live power, which Is the one thing that
Â¦weak stomachs lack, and unless that lack
Is supplied lt is_ useless to attempt to as-
Fift it by the use of "tonic?," "pills" and
cathartics, which haVe absolutely no di-
peftlve power and do not claim to have
any.
The rcg-uiar use of one or two of Stu-
erfs Dyspepsia. Tablets, after meals, will
demonstrate their merit and efficiency-
better than any other argument.
They are sold by drug-grists everywhere.

Beach Supply Entirely
Exhausted.
FOOD PLENTIFUL BUT DEAR
STAMPEDE OF MIITEBS TO CAPE
YORK.
Beach Sand Is Not Very Promising,
but There Is Believed to Be
Plenty of Gold in the
Creeks.
SEATTLE, Feb. 24.â The first news of
the winter from Cape Nome reached here
to-day In Daw'son papers, reporting the
arrival there of Carl yon Knobelsdorff and
Charles D. Campbell, who left Nome De
cember 10 and reached Dawson early in
this month. Knobelsdorff and Campbell
report:
There is plenty of food at Noipe lo last
through the winter and until the first
steamers arrive there next, summer. The
only scarce article is wood, which wa'
selling at $65 a cord when they left. The
supply of wood along the beach was con
sumed for a distance of ten miles up and
down from Nome City, and the prospects
were for a practical famine in this fuol
before spring. The coal price for sal'j wa a
7 cents a pound, though there was little
of it on hand and it was being refused to
buyers. The large transportation compa
nies, however, had enough coal on hand
to last them. There was not considered
much likelihood of suffering from the cola.
Flour was selling at $6 a sack, bacon SO lo
40 cents a pound, ham 45 cents, sugar 2b
cents, dried fruit 25 cents, rice 15, oa'.iriesl
20, beans 15. canned meats ?1 a can, canned
fruit 75 cents a can, fresh meat $1 to $1 25
a pound, baking powder 51. meals $1 to
$1 50 and lodging $1 to $4 a night. Egze,
fresh potatoes and onions were out of the
market by December 1, when eggs sold lor
$3 a dozen and potatoes and onions }15 for
a hundred-pound crate.
Stampedes are reported to have been of
frequent occurrence during the winter.
The latest excitement was above Cape
York and opposite in the interior alonÂ«j
the Anakovik and Linden rivers and theli
branches. The York beach sand was not
believed to be very premising, but the
prospects on the creeks were excellent.
Below and southeast of Nome furnish the
best reports In the bonanza district, there
having been reported a rich strike in
coarse gold. Outside Anvil, Glacier an 1
Dexter creek> and Snow Gulch the pros
pecting was only superficial.
A' party below Discovery, on Anvil
Creek, a tributary of Snake River, shcwr.d
5192.000 as the result of the four months
sluicing. The largest nugget foun.i in
this claim was valued at $418. Men wore
sinking holes through the ice out from the
beach in December- to find if there was
gold In the bottom of the ocean. Â«.um
mings took the biggest pile from the
beach a quarter of a mile from NomÂ°. He
is said to have realized $15,000 for his st-;i
son's rocking. The rich spot on the beach,
the Spit, within a mile of Snake River,
above Nome, was all worked out, and the
best pay of the entire beach for a distance
of fourteen miles was taken out. kittle
development work has been done in tne
Tundra, so its value was unknown.
February 5 fifty-one teams left Dawson
for Nome, and up to noon of the next day
twenty-eight more had. started.

OLD.Prohibition as a Live Issue.
A large, audience was present last night
at Pythian Castle Hall to hear an address
by Colonel Frank J. SJbley of Atlanta,
Georgia, on "Prohibition as a Live IsÂ«ue
of the Day." The speaker contended that
all other questions, Including that of
finance, expansion and the tariff, were
subordinated to that of prohibition, which
would eclipse all the others before many
days had passed. He held that the ques
tion of prohibition involved the happiness
of the home and family. The liquor traf
fic he regarded as a menace to the future
prosperity of the nation and he advocated
radical measures to exterminate It.
GADSKI IN GERMAN OPERA.
Peerless Artiste to B; Heard With
Damrosch and Bispham.
An operatic treat is undoubtedly In
store for the music lovers of this city in
the concerts comprising Wagner operas
to be given at the California Theater,
commencing March 6, with Mme. Gadskl
as the stellar attraction. When the tal
ented artiste was here with the Ellis Opera
Company last year It was the cause of
much regret that she was unable to ap
pear In German operas because the man
agement could find no available tenor. C.
L. Graff, who is directing the transcon
tinental tour of a small but talented com
pany, has evolved a unique plan to bring
out the wonderful power of Gadskl's
voice, which has been specially trained
for German opera. ,He has engaged Wal
ter Damrosch, who will explain and Illus
trate at the piano the words and music
and all the important excerpts from thq
opera selected by Gadskl, who will be
heard in the same arias as though a com
plete performance were given. David
Bispham, who has everywhere won
plaudits for his rendition of the barytone
roles, will be a valuable assistant to
Gadskl.
The operas to be presented include
"Tannhauscr," "The Flying Dutchman,"
"Die Melsterslnger," "Lohengrin" and
others. The programme will be particu
larly attractive ' and has met with un
bounded success In New York. Philadel
phia and Buffalo. , Mr. Damrosch will also
be heard at Sherman-Clay Hall In the
mornings In a recital of his own composi
tions, which are destined to deeply In
terest musical circles.

"I find Grape-Nuts very helpful to a
man troubled with the cares and worri-
ment of business." says Louis Fink Jr..
of 59 S. 4th street, Philadelphia.
"At the time I commenced using the
food I was very weak from want of
prnperly selected food. The help I re-
ceived from the powerful food elements
in Grape-Nuts was indeed wonderful. I
have come to use the food regularly and
do not think a breakfast complete with-
out it.
"I suggest you mention in your ad-
vertisements that Grape-Nuts are noth-
ing like Oatmeal, for many of my friends
express themselves as weary of the
rr.ushee and such will find a delightful
change in taste and results by using

Charges of Discrimination Against
Veterans to Bs Investigated at
Hare Island.
Last Friday night the' Veterans' Civil
War Association held a meeting with
Martin Murray, the president. In : the
chair.
The standing committee announced that
sworn charges had been preferred against
L4eutenant Halliday. Foreman Sargeant,
Foreman. Trebell and others at the navy
yard. at Mare Island of having discrim
inated against veterans of the Civil War
In the matter of appointments, and a let
ter was read from President McKinley
announcing that these charges had been
referred to the Secretary of the.. Navy
Subsequently Secretary Savage read a let
ter from the Secretary of trie Navy an
nouncing, that an investigation into the
charges had been ordered at Mare Island
for the 26th Inst. and that all veterans In
terested forward their names and ad
dresÃes where the Investigation Is to be
held.
i M. T. Sullivan spoke at some length on
the subject of civil service and against
what he declared were "Imported English
customs" and thought that before "a set
of politicians attempted, to foist such cus
toms upon the -country they should first
by popular vote consult the wishes of
70/Wo.OOO Intelligent American citizens."
On the subject of pensions he nald that
the average pension now allowed to those
who served in the war Is $6 a month or
20 cents a day. scarcely enough to. buy
soup meat. for a veteran and'hls family:
yet the cry of thoie who never smelt
powder is that the pensions are too high
and that the soldiers had' been paid for
their services.' The men' enlisted. and. were
to be paid $13 a* month. They were paid
that amount in greenbacks, which, In 1*65,
were worth 35 cents on the dollar, mak
ing the pay of the soldiers equal to U 65;
that's how they were paid for their ser
vices. ;Â«V: .

SUFFRAGEâ V. T.. Santa Rosa. Cal.
The Federal constitution would not have
to be amended to enable women to vote,
for the reason that the right of suffrage
is governed by the Individual States, each
State declaring which of Its citizens, are
entitled to the right to vote. As the cen
sus of the State of California has not been
taken for ten years It is impossible at this
time to tell what the proportion of men
and women is. It is estimated that the
population of the State is 1.410,000. anri
that as to sex it is about equally divided.
An estimate Is that In January, 1599. the
male population of voting age in Califor
nia was 403,000. At the election for Gov
ernor In IS9B (November S) there were 257.
055 votes cast. There is no tabulated rec
ord of the number of qualified voters who
register, nor of those who having reglb
tered fall to vote In this State. There are
no figures to show what percentages of
women in this State make their living
by working outside of their homes.

the Boers and to testify their sympathy
with that' oppressed but plucky people.
Judged M. .Cooney delivered the address
of the evening, .and his scathing arraign

liberate attempt to drive uut thÂ« JJoers
from a land to which they had an abso
lute right was received with unbounded
applause and frfquent cheers.
The appearance of Miss Sannle Kruger,
niece or "Oom Paul" Kruger, was also
the signal for prolonged cneering, and her
singing of the "Transvaal Hyma " worked
her auditors up tv an extraordinary pitch
of excitement.

"It was never intended by Providence that

The British Government has undertaken to

an impossible Job. The question of the right
of the Uoers to govern themselves cannot be
disputed, even by a member of Parliament.
England h&s practiced that doctrine of appro

"The people of this country ought to be ln

Above all the facts of our time Hypnotism
is Just now a theme of curiosity} "Were you

really good for? Ia It true we can be put la
a trance at the hypnotist's will and yet have
consciousness to say and do a host of wonder-
ful thlnjys? Hyv can any one possibly ba

fact that any ons can learn how to hypnotize?".'
Such ar* a few of the questions that people are
everywhere asking. Well. I can give them
llg*it As America's leading Hypnotist I can
tell them even more than they seek to know.
1 am at present sending out a FREE BOOK

one person may cast another by very simple
means. Anybody can learn how to do It aa
well as the most txperienceil hypnotist. The
study is neither deep nor difficult. When you
haw mastered It you will have all humanity
for your profitable us^. Tour power over the
subject's mind is absolute. He will do or say
at your bidding a thousand things he is not
capable of In the waking state. HÂ» thinks,
acts, feels and sp^akn only as you want him
to, and has no memory whatever of it aft^r
the spell Is broken. In fact, when you hypno-
tize a subject you seem to enter into his mln-1
and invest It with new powers and then rula
mind and senses for just as long as you pease.
He Is as clay and you the potter.
Its Wonders and Uses.
All the strange' phenomena of Hypnotism

the victims of pain and disease. In this last
respect I may well call It the "heal'ng of thÂ«
future," for. as my book will prov? to you, it

disorders of the human body or mind.
You Can Learn Hypnotism.
In spite of these noble uses and In spite of
Its my*terlors powers. Hypnotism ia an easy
and' most simple art to learn. It calls for no
special training or education. It Imposes mi
long or perplexing Â«udy. Whoever knows
enough to read can learn it. My free book is
called a "Key to the Jlysterles of Hypnotism."

nense that anybody can unlock Its s?crÂ«ts and

free to the simplest as well as to the most'
scholarly. The humblest can use them as well

ticulars of how this Is done. The phenomena.
of Hypnotism are simply exhaustless as a
source of knowledge, recreation cr side-split-
ting fun.

HER MIND UNBALANCED.
Miss Margaret Cheney Tries to Jump
Into the Bay While Insane.
Miss Margaret Cheney, who has be
come mentally unbalanced through pro
longed illness, escaped from her home at
745 Elizabeth street early yesterday morn
ing and wandered down to the water
front. The unforunate girl walked out
to the end of <he Clay street wharf and
began to disrobe preparatory to jumping
Into the bay. when she was seen by Offi
cers' James Mackey and T. Gibbons, who
took her to the Harbor police station. The
girl's relatives were notified and the girl
was removed to her home.
Probert Was Insane.
'A Coroner's Jury yesterday rendered a
verdief'that* Edward Probert, the capital
ist,-who-committed suicide' last Thursday
by shooting'himself through the head
with a revolver, was fnsane when he
fired- the shot. Autopsy Surgeon Leland
testified that the deceased could not have
lived" more than two weeks longer, as he
was far gone with heart disease.
That he will be greeted with open
arms to-morrow night is a -foregone con
clusion, because he has Â»>?Â«'* {Â£{2 o f
warm place in the hearts of the people ot
this city by reason of. his beautiful play
and his sterling acting. Although ho nas
delayed his visit to this city Mr. Thomp
son has tried to make amends by bring
ing his charming daughter, Annie Thomp
son, who has won high mention for her
interpretation of the role of Rickety
Ann. She will surely win fame with local
audiences, as she is a conscientious act
ress and has made a deep study of the
important role.
Another lady In the company Is Miss
Ethel Ormonde, who has quite a reputa
tion throughout- the Eastern country as
an actress of great ability. Miss Ormonde
has been in retirement for the past few
years, but was induced by Mr. Thompson
to- join his special company on its trans
continental tour. â¢
Both actresses possess splendid singing
voices and are heard to fine effect In the
rendition of. "The Palms" in the Grace

Mysterious Wreckage.
The officers of the transport Hancock
reported to the Merchants' Exchange yes
terday that on February 23, in latitude 37
degrees 59 minutes north, longitude 124
degrees 30 minutes west (off Point Reyes)
the topmast of a vessel with the yards at
tached was passed. There was also con
siderable wreckage about the place where
the topmast was seen. There are none of
the coasting fleet overdue and only one
square-rigger, that is now out eleven days
from the Sound, could possibly have been
in the vicinity. None of the European
or Australian fleet is overdue and the
wreckage reported by the Hancock is
bothering the ship owners somewhat. The
accident will probably turn out to.be the
dismasting of one of the fleet that left
here during last month for Australia and
South Africa with cargoes of lumber

British Ship General Roberts, Which Carries as a Figurehead an Effigy of "Bobs."
!?N the experience of a British tramp bhip which arrived In this port on Wednesday from Newcastle. N. S. "W., the
fupcrstitio'js!y inclined are drawing an aufrury of pending disaster to the British arms in South Africa, and all because
I of a name. During the height of the enthusiasm in England immediately following the news of General Roberts'
I fair.oup march to Kandahar, a firm of ship-builders gave the name of the military hero to a new vessel that was about
to be launched and affixed his effigy to the bow of the craft as an appropriate figure-head. The launching of the Gen
eral Robert* was rr.ade the occasion for a big demonstration and the vessel in the years that have passed has proved
etanch and In every way satisfactory.
The first serious trouble that occurred to the General Roberts came shortly after the beginning of the war between
the Britlr/n and the Boers. The ship had just landed a cargo of lumber at Cape Town and cleared for Australia In bal
last. On the voyage she encountered a severe storm and her beautiful tlgure-head was shorn of Its arms. The ship had
otherwise suffered but little In its battle. with the elements and no particular significance was attached to the loss of
"Bobs" '" arms, which could easily be replaced. But that was before General Roberts was ordered to South Africa to
take supreme command of the British forces there.
Now for the augury. It is generally admitted that Roberts' strategic campaign was remarkably successful up to the
time h< had apparently cornered Cronje, a few days ago. but since that time there has been no definite news of British
Buccessr-fâ rather the reverse. Xow. the augurs who watch the bulletin boards and the water front solemnly call attention
to the fact that since the arrival of the armless effigy of the British general he has made absolutely no headway against
the Hocrs, and they say that the rumors of pending disaster to the British arm? in South Africa is a certain warning and
notification of what is to come. The General Roberts will soon return to England, when the damaged effigy will be re
placed. Will the original "Bobs" be shipped back to England for repairs?

THE resignation cf Charlie Baldwin
from the Burlingame Club because
of the slight put' upon his sister, Mrs.
Edward Parker Deacon, has set all
society by the rars, and now nothing
is heard within the charmed circle
of swelldom but. the buzzing and hum- j
mlng of the butterflies of fashion as they
flit from house to house to compare notes
and speculate on the awful event.
That Mrs. Deacon has left the city and i
that her brother is to follow; that Ho- j
bart has not resigned, as was reported; i
that a thousand and one things that!
might have occurred that were said to
have occurred did not occur makes no
difference. Society is talking and will not
be quiet until it has thoroughly exhausted
every phase of the affair, possible or im
possible.
Society's opportunity for a real inter
national scandal came when Charlie Bald
win attempted to make his sister his"
guest at a Burlingame lunch party, an>.l
the result has been all that could pos
sibly be desired by even the most active
in the work of regenerating the wild and
woolly West.
The scandal that the attempt and the
protest.lt raised has occasioned has not
only srt all the city gossiping but has
been flashed overthe wires to the utter
most parts of the country and is now as
hungrily discussed in the boudoirs of New
York, Boston. Philadelphia and other cen
ters of fashion and frivolity as It is here,
where it originated.
The true story of the occurrence that
has raised such a storm and has divided
all of swelldom into two opposing -camps
is as follows:
Some three months ago Mrs. Deacon,
who, as every one knows, is the unfortu
nate woman who was mixed up In the
affair with Emlle Abeille at Cannes,
France, which resulted in that gentle
man being shot to death by Deacon, who
was afterward tried for murder and ac
quitted by a French court, came out here
to visit her brother.
She spent most of her time In quiet re
tirement at the Baldwin Mountain View
Ranch in Santa Clara County, receiving
no callers and making no attempt to mix
In any way with the righteous of .the local
Four Hundred.
that file the statements. The second rea
son was worse than tlie first, an.l Asses
sor Dodge probably made It because he
knew that the persons who had made the
statements In the cases at issue were
dead. The Assessor had abftalutely no rea
son to give for his extraordinary action.
Taxes that belonged to the city and could
be had for the asking were slipping away
from the treasury. And then Assessor
Dodge pleaded that his bondmen would be
held In responsibility for any error he
might commit. He knew that under a
section of the Political Code he is not re
sponsible for errors and that taxes form
the first and primary claim upon an es
tate and 'are not barred by any time limi
tation which may be made.
But the Assessor was obdurate. He
would not demand the taxes due to the
city and the heritage was lost to this
board, which now has the power .to force
the Assessor to do his duty. It is argued
that litigation may follow* the demand.
This may be so, but the result is not in
the slightest degree changed. If the Su
pervisors have a reasonable certainty of
success a crisis can be postponed until the
next fiscal year, when it can be met. The
fact remains that the present board can
raise the money which is needed by de
manding the taxes due to the city and not
by shutting off the street lights*.

was through the efforts of Ofneer "Jack"

worn by Chinamen and managed to gain
access to Wong Fook's gambling rooms
unnoticed. Watching his opportunity,
Conlan gathered in the necessary evidence

were removed to the police station. Con

Chief Sullivan visited the Nymphia and
inspected the place. He stated he was
opposed to the resort and would in all

The deceased was one of the best known
and best liked men In the hotel business
on the entire coast. He was a native of
Ireland and about 40 years of age. He
came to the United States at the age of
19. and after spending a short time In the
East started out to seek his fortune In
the West." He had pursued the hotel busi
ness In various of the Eastern cities and
upon arriving in this city found little diffi
culty In procuring employment.
He managed the Mercantile Lunch dur
ing its palmiest days and was for many
years connected with the Occidental
Hotel, golns from that house to the Cali
fornia, where he occupied the position of
chief clerk at the time of his death. Mr.
Downing was a single man. The funeral

men. to a unit, are with Baldwin and his
sister;, and, strange to say, the women,
who In such cases are generally as hard
on the erring ones of their own sex as
they are lenient to the black sheep of the
other, are on the same side.
They say that while the publicity that
attended the first scandal In which Mrs.
Deacon was Involved was such as to bar
her forever from being received, yet she
should not be molested, and, as long as
she did not intrude herself on the notice
of those who wished to pass her by. she
should have been allowed to go quietly on
her own way. They say. moreover, that
as the club was a semi-public place Bald
win should have been allowed to invite
his own relatives there, and if there was
any objection to his so doing that objec
tion should have come from the board of
directors ana not from the matron or
any of her supporters.
They say there have boon other Inci
dents which have been passed over, such
as the Gaiety girl affair, in which a well
known clubman was concerned, and they
cannot see why this affair should not
have been passed over in like manner.
There is another rumor which saya
that the matron was less actuated by her
interest to prevent the of
society in general than she was by a de
sire to pay off scores left from an old
feud. But this rumor cannot be substan
tiated.
The report that Walter Hobart haÂ»
also resigned from the club is false.
While he, as a brother-ln-law'x>f Bald
win, -naturally takes the matter very
much to heart, he has not gone to the
lengths of resigning from the club nor Is
he likely to do so.

MARRIED AT ST. JAMES.
William J. . Fleming and Maude
Lockie Now 1/Le.n and Wife.
The marriage of William J. Fleming,
the son of Captain David Fleming, a well
known resident of the Mission, and Miss
Maude Lockle, daughter of Mrs. Ellen
Lqckie of Vacaville, took place at St.
James Church Thursday morning. The
ceremony was performed by Rev. Father
Dempsey of St. Mary's Cathedral at 8:30.
Miss Carrie Lockie was maid of honor.
Daniel Cauley acted as groomsman. The
bride .is an accomplished and attractive
young woman and the groom is prominent
In business circles. The young couple will
spend their honeymoon traveling to points
of interest on the coast.
Some six weeks ago Mr. and Mrs. Bald
win and Mrs.- Deacon drove over-to spend
a few days with. Walter- S. Hobart. the
brother-in-law of. Charlie Baldwin.
Shortly after-they arrived 'at! the Hobart
place a telephone message- was received
at the club from Baldwin ordering lunch
for six. .At. the time the message was re
ceived there was a party on the club
porch, who in some way or other became
aware of what was going on.
In this party was a matron who has ever
been foremost in the good work of regen
eration and who, during a long and ardu
ous career as. a social constructor, has
ever been the foremost to seize on every
thing that could help to promote the as
pirations of those who were toiling up the
steep paths that lead to the gladsome
light of conventional excellence.
This matron heard of the order and saw
her chance for a grand coup. Baldwin
was going to bring his sister, Mrs. Dea
con, to lunch within the sacred portals of
aristocratic^ Burlingame. Society needed
a first-class, good scandal, and here .was
the opportunity to make one and present
to San Francisco's real people the one
thing they needed to "give, them' that
standing for which they had so . long
strived.
She at once protested against the pres
ence of Mrs. Deacon as prejudicial to the
goodgOrder of San Francisco matrons and
as against the discipline of San Francisco
maids. She was backed in her protest by
those of her own set who were with her,
and the matter finally became so warm that
some of the men of the club approached
Dick Tobin, who is Baldwin's most intimate
friend, and requested him to see Baldwin
and tell him of the state of affairs at the
club, so that he might keep his sister
away and prevent her being subjected to
the Insult and humiliation that would sure
ly be hers as soon as she appeared in the
vicinity of the matron and her supporters.
The men who approached Tobln did so
not because of any objections they them
selves'had to the presence of Mrs. Dea
con, but because they wished â¢to have
Baldwin warned . and prevent If possible
pain to a woman who has already suffered
more than her allotted share.
; Tobin at once drove out to the Hobart
place in San Mateo and, seeing Baldwin,
acquainted him with the situation at the
clubhouse.
Baldwin was at first thunderstruck at
the news he received. lie could very well
understand that many women would not
care to receive h!s sister after the scan
dal that; had been attached to her name,
but. he could not understand that there
were any so uncharitable H3 to object to
her presence as a guest in a semi-public
place.
'As soon as the matter had been made
plain to him. however, he at once ac
quiesced in the wishes of the matron and
her following and recalled i his order for
lunch .by the same messenger who took
his. resignation as ;a .member of. the club.
"The^ resignation was riot -accepted nor Is
there any likelihood of its ever 'being.
But. those ' who know the 'character of
Baldwin say that the wound he received
through his love for his sister is too deep
to lightly; heal, and, accepted or not, his
resignation "goes,", "and he, will never
again enter the place where : one' of his
family received such an â¢ insult. This is
the story; â¢ now for the aftermath. .
Mrs.: Deacon has already gone East,
and it is only a matter ot a few days bo
fore the Baldwins \ will f0110w.,. As far
as they are concerned- 'the- incident is
closed. But not so with the' rest of the
grandc â¢ monde. , The matter'means tou
much 'Â¦ Importance ..'to 1 the. aspirations of
our!' budding, society to be' lightly cant
aside. Society has been provided with iv
heart's . desire and^ it is makings the most
of the goods the gods and the' matron
have given it: .On- all sides; the episode
Is the one topic of discussion, and strange
to say Mrs. Deacon lÂ» : not the one who is
getting. the- worst of it! .->â¢Â¦ 'Â¦.'Â¦ Â¦;\ .-. ; : ..
None.- of those whose opinions \ carry
weight is arrayed against her. Popular
sympathy has been aroused by" the hu
miliation to which she has been subjected,
and. while -the scandal Is Â¦ none, the less
potent in the 'effect it^ has oh the prestige
of '. San Francisco's j smart set, , yet" the
matron' is being handled- without gloves

TEACHERS WILL PROTEST.
Substitutes Object to the New Board
Reducing Their Salaries.
Substitute teachers in the local depart
ment will not submit to a reduction of
their pay for working days without a
struggle. Under the old rules substitutes
were paid S3 50 a day for their services
when actually engaged in one of the
schools, and were given $1 a day for hold
ing themselves In readiness for such ser
vice when not engaged with a class.
When the new board went into office it
was manifest that some mode for re
trenchment must be sought out. It was
decided to reduce the salaries for the sub
stitutes to $2 50 for working days, this re
duction materially assisting in the effort
,to- prevent the depletion of the school
funa.
Last Friday evening a meeting of the
substitute teachers was held at the'resi
dence of Rose M. Stack. 703 Shotwell
.street, for the purpose of drawing up res
olutions to be presented to the board, pro
testing against the proposed reduction.
The substitute teachers claim that if sal
aries must be reduced an equal reduction
of all salaries should be made. They say
that it Is unjust for the reduction to fall
solely on the substitutes, and point to
the fact that there will soon be a week's
vacation in all schools and six weeks' va
cation in summer, which will greatly re
duce their income for the year, irrespec
tive of any decrease in salary. Resolu
tions were drawn up and signed by the
substitute teachers present.' and many cit
ixens not connected with the department
signified their willingness to sign the pe
tition. The document will be presented
to the board at the next regular meet
ing.
THE Finar.ee Committee of the Boari
of Supervisors has decided that t'.ie
street lights cf San Francisco sha'.l
be put out at least every alternate
night, ;ir.d probably every nigh*, for
four months beginning with March
L The committee insists that the outrage
upon the people of the city is absolutely
necessary as a measure of economy nr.d
that there is no other way In which to ts
cape from the financial difficulty In which
the municipal government is involved. The
members of the committee, as well as the
rest of the Board of Supervisors, are
frank enough to admit that the refuge of
four months of darkness is a menace to
lives and property of the city and an in
jury of great magnitude to merchants anÂ«l
tradesmen. The Jucal legislators agree
that their proposed remedy will Inevitably
hurt the- city in the opinion of visitors,
but they ask blandly what other remedy
can be offered.
The creditors of the city must be paid,
they argue. Salaries must be met anil a
financial muddle cleared away. They have
tried every conceivable scheme, they ln-
Fist, but without success. They are forced
therefore to throw San Francisco iuM
darkness, leave its citizens at the mercy
of eight marauders, injure its business
men and Invite ridicule from other com
munities.
When the Supervisors declare that tl.ey
have canvassed every possible avenue of
escape from a disagreeable predicament
they are mistaken. They have done noth
ing of the sort, and at their very doors,
within their reach and power, is a remedy
to cure the financial evil, raise over SsO.OOO
and leave the city with its indispensable
night lights.
Blame Bests on Dodge.
This remedy has been entirely over
looked by the Finance Committee of the
Board of Supervisors, but It has but
to consult with Assessor Washington
Dodge, urge him or direct him to perform
his duty under the law and the thing is
done. Residents of the outlying district*,
members of the various improvement
clubs who are most vitally interested In
this matter, have urged no reason for
their protest against the shutting off of the
lights. They have shown what an outrage
the measure would inflict upon the city,
but they have not shown how It is to be
avoided. They are to meet the members
of the Board of Supervisors again, r.Â»l
will have an opportunity to ask questions
which possess at least the virtue of public
interest. *
The Board of SÂ«i>Â«*rrtsor**Â«vhich retired
from office In January attempted to ac
comrlish what the present board has en
tirely overlooked. It will be remembered ;
that the appraisers of many large estates
placed upon the property under their.
Jurisdiction values vastly in excess of;
those plaovi upon the same property by-.
Assessor Dodge. The estate of Lloyd
Tevls. for txamplf. or more strictly
speaking, that part of the estate of Lloyd
Tevis which is assessable in this city and
county, was appraised at $3.003.T>43, while
it was assessed only for $76,213. The
estate of William A. Piper was appraised
for $556,000 while it was assessed for $10,
156. In scores of other cases the same re
markable difference between the assess
ment and the appraisement is shown. The
? state of L. P. Drexler was appraised for :
njMla&Si and assessed for practically noth
ing.
Streets Can Be Lighted.
It Is thus evident that many millions of
dollars, at least eight millions and prob
ably tea millions, escaped taxation under
the lasf assessment made by Assessor
Dodge. The sworn testimony of apprais
ers is proof of the fact. The evidence is
clear and the conclusion is inevitable.
This property should be taxed and the law
provide! the method in which the taxes
can b*> collected. Assessor Dodge, who
made his campaign with the ever repeated
boast that he had reduced the taxes of
poor people can take steps at least to give
the people 'he advantage of the law. If
these many millions in property are forced
to bear their just burden of taxation over
S^Q.WW and probably $100,000 can be col
lected and the serious problem which the
Hoard of Supervisors has been trying to
answer will have been solved. - â¢'
When the gigantic frauds in property
valuations were revealed in the appraise
ment of estates the last Board of Super
visors took steps to induce the Assessor
to place the increased valuation In
Ills taxable roll and demand taxes.
A. CJ. Platt, an expert employed:
by the board. made the sugges
tion after extended investigation ana the
board, calling upon the Assessor to act,
adopted resolutions unanimously. The at
tention of the Assessor was called par
ticularly to the condition of affairs re
vca'.c-d in the appraisements. It was
phown that the city had been cheated out
of thousands of dollars to which it was
entitled, that the rich man and not the
poor man had r scaped taxation. But As
â¢esor Dodge took no action. He who
hat Ixen so eager to search out the hold
ings of capitalists and corporations was
singularly inactive. Time and again the
Supervisors called upon him to take ac
tion, hut he did nothing.
How the Deficit Can Be Met.
The law on the matter seemed to be per
fectly clear even to the unaerstanding of
a layman. It is a point universally con
ceded that the city can lose nothing In
taxation by fraud or error or omission.
The codes barÂ« provided against these
r-nntir.etTicifs, as the lollowlng. section
Â£ESI of the Political Code, will show:
â¢'OmiKslonK. errors or defects in form
In nnv original or duplicate assessment

WHAT RACING GAMBLERS
CAN PLEAD INS DEFENSE
The Evil of Ingleside as It Is Seen in Its
Harvest of Sorrow.
A Petition to Which the Board of Supervisors
Should Give Deep Consideration Before
T how \/flto Â¦
SINCE certain members of tne Board of Supervisors have shown an Inclina
tion, to reopen Ingleside. that field of blood which Is stained with the sin
and sorrow of so many of the people of San Francisco, let Ihe worthy
gentlemen who have been chosen to make our municipal laws seek a
justification for their action. Let them demand from the lawyers who are
paid with money niched from thieving hands to plead a- cause which has left
its trail of crime and shame, distress and disgrace, dishonor and death, a reason
for the revival of the thieves' nest and the re-establishment of the poolrooms,
those nurseries of vice and training schools for the penitentiary.
Â¦ The Supervisors should not deceive themselves nor evade the solemn responsi
bility which Is upon them. The records of the jail, the prison and the peniten
tiary, the silent history of the Morgue, the denunciation of the pulpit and of th<*
press, the protest of men of affairs and of business bear testimony against the
gamblers who would ply again their dreadful trade among . the people of San
Francisco.. The story of .wrecked lives and shattered home,s. the mute evidence
of suicides, the debauchery of men and the ruin of women, which have made
of San Francisco a marked city, are facts which the Supervisors can neither un
derestimate nor Ignore.
Let the men who accepted office as the pioneers and champions of a new and
better San Francisco face the issue squarely. Let them reflect that with the com
ing of Ingleside a wave of crime, traceable directly to the doors of the race
course, swept over this city; that men sacrificed themselves and their families,
giving up the duties that bound them to decent, honorable lives; that young men
robbed their employers, dishonored their families and are paying still their
tribute to gambling thieves by smarting under the stripes of convicts: that busi
ness men were forced to establish a vast system of espionage and had reason to
trust no one in the daily dread of personal injury which the record of crime,
suicide and murder was pointing nearer and nearer to their own doors.
Let the Supervisors reflect upon these facts before they make their decision
and let them be prepared to vindicate themselves before the city which they will
injure. Let them learn from the police that with the passing of Ingleside the
wave of violent deeds passed with It and that as if by ma^lc the social atmos
phere of the city was purified. It was as If a moral pestilence had been removed.
And since the Supervisors have listened with Inclination to the lawyers of
the gamblers let the Supervisors insist that the attorneys state the case plainly
and truthfully, omitting no fact and garbling none. Let the petition of these
men who have been a blight to every community they have infested become a
public record to show those that Indorsed It and be for those that championed
It the badge of their dishonor.
If these lawyers cannot- "frame such a petition, which must be true. The Call
will do so for them and in doing go asks the Supervisors to give to it the'con
sideration they have shown to the thieves of the racecourse. In keeping with
the strict formality which has characterized the affair thus far the petition should
read something like" this:

UNLESS the fortunes of coursing go
strongly against Curtis & Son's
greyhound I-.ux.or, the great son of
Skyrocket-Wave should carry off
ell the honors in the John Grace
cup Ktake at Union Coursing Park
tc-day. The preliminary round of this,
the richest stake of the year, was run
yesterday and the followers of coursing
were enabled to get a line on the condi
tion of the dogs", which have all been
given especial preparation for this event.
.Luxor, with IU-gina. ft. from the McEner
ney kernels" Merced, were the third brace
of dogs Flipped. Although the Merced
representative was fast, the San Jose dog
led her ten lengths across the lield. His
easy, frictionless stride told of his superb
condition. He won by a score of 5 points
to 2. his clever opponent doing some work
on the hare.

kennWf. shared the stake favoritism with
l.uinr when betting commenced, but after
his course with Rock Island lioy he re

running 1 minute and 25 sec-onus. White

one time the score was 9 to If, but the
harÂ«Â» lived long enough for Whitehead
to run up the score to 15 to U in his favor
at the Kill. Tlie white and black dog
showed great speed, and his bulldog cour
age may carry him muf'i farther into the
stake to-day than some of the persons
who saw him run yesterday think possi
ble after his long run.
Of the thirty-six greyhounds still in the
Flake and which will run to-day, only
three have never won a stake. As all
have undergone special preparation lor
this competition, the bettors are all at
fta on nearly every course. In the long

COAST REVOLVER RECORD MADE BY C. M. DAISS.
The fifty-shot revolver match be
tween C. M. Daiss and F. O. Young
at the meeting of the' Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club at Harbor View range
last Sunday is deserving of more
than passing notice, as Mr. Dalss
broke the coast record on both the
Columbia and Creedmoor counts. In
the target the eight-Inch
bullsey'e of the Creedmoor target is
preserved, hence the record made by
the local marksman stands on each.
In the match he defeated Mr. Young
by several point?, * each shooting .44
Russian model target revolvers at
fifty yards. Dalss' individual shots,
Columbia count, were the following:
7â Sâ 7â lâ 2â Sâ 4â 4â &â 3 50
4-11-1-5-2-6-5-9-5-3 51

5â5 â S â 8 â 5 â 9â9 â 5 â 7â7 â 1 â 5â35 â 3 59
Total number of rings 273
The Columbia count gives 273 rings
and the Creedmoor count 246 points
out of a possible 250, only 4 out of the
50 shots being outside the eight-Inch
ring. This Is the best 50-shot record
on the coast, and it was only beaten
by Anderton. the Eastern shot, who
made Â¦ forty-eight bullseyes recently.
In the third score all of Dalss' shots
were 6 or better, which shows the en
tire 10 were inclosed in a ring six
Inches In diameter. This Is a difficult
performance even with a target pistol
of small caliber. Young's score in the
match totaled 309 Columbia target
count and 240 Creedmoor count.

factory. There Is loss in membership, god de

ceased to be a source of revenue. The cost of
maintaining the outside properties for the last
five years has exceeded the receipts from them.
These conditions call for a radical change of
policy and more progressive managements WÂ«
favor a change In the system of election of

FLEET GREYHOUNDS RUN
FOR VALUABLE STAKES
GEYSER NOT
AMONG THE
FIRST THREE
Handicap \at Tanforan Wen
by R W. Brode, With ,
Zoroaster Second.;
The greatness of Corrigan's Geyser Is
fast disappearing like snow - under . the
rays of a tropical sun. , He is .nothing
more nor less than a- fair sprinter, and by
no means a "phenom" at that. His many
victories in soft spots made to order for
him actually caused many to believe the
gelding another Hanover, and with 121
pounds and Spencer' in the saddle Corri
gan's pet was installed favorite for the
mile and afurlong handicap at Tanforan
Park yesterday. Gay Tommy Burns had
the pleasure of riding the winner in F.
W. Brode. .The Schorr three-year-old
shouldered IC3 pounds and In a desperate
duel with Zoroaster, piloted in masterly
fashion, won by a head in the remark
ably fast time of l:52Vi.
The running the first part was shaped
out entirely by Potente. trailed by Geyser.
In the stretch the latter "dogged it badly,
while Potente fought it out gamely, finish
ing a close third. Zoroaster, packing
Henry and 113 pounds, ran a remarkable
race, for he was cut off at the start, losing
half a dozen lengths. Had the distance
been a trifle farther the little fellow
would havo won as it was, for Brode was
a very tired horse. Advance Guard ran
a wretched race.
Everything favored the sport, Â¦ the
weather being warm and balmy and the
track in perfect condition. The crowd,
though, was far below the -customary
Saturday gathering in point of numbers.
Five of six favorites were ruthlessly
slaughtered, the talent having away the
worst of the argument with the books.
.One of the very warmest things un
corked in some time was Pirate J, which
took the second event, a five furlong
scramble, from a big field of platers. The
colt is said to belong to Willie Martin,
and from 8 hjs price was hammered down
to 6 to 5. Piggott had the mount and in
front soon after the start won very han
dily from Formatus. with Isaline third.
The ring, lost heavily to the race.
Barney Schreiber's fi!!y Sofala displayed
her old-time form in the two-year-cM
scramble. Corrigan's youngster W. F.
Tarpey went to the post favorite over her,
and she had the race won from the start,
stepping the four furlongs off in 48 sec
onds flat. Moonbright took the show fiom
Raveling, the only other starter.
Monita, ridden by McKcnna, capture!
the mile and a quarter hurdle handicap
at -odds of" 8 to 1. Corrlgan's jumper
Schreiber made the running and lookec! a
winner up to the last obstacle, where he
fell back. Monita had the most left at the
end. winning cleverly from Durwarc*.
L.omo. the favorite, seemed afflicted wiiii
intermittent bursts of speed, finishing a.
close third. Â¦ -
The fifth race, a six-furlong sprint, was
responsible for many hot tips. Sevens
started for the first time this season, an 1
with Bullman in the saddle had her odds
played down from 2 to 1 to A to 5. Rev
Hooker was. also .well supported. Sewns
showed first into the stretch but couM not
stay. As Duke of York and Gold Baton
were fighting it out Ross, astride the 13 to
1 shot Inverary. came with a rush, beat
ing both hands down.
Beaten In slow time earlier in the week
with Spencer on his back. Formero took
the last number, at six furlongs, in fast
time. Eddie Ross had the leg up oir Willie
Sink's horse, and in a hard drive got the
verdict over Pompino by a nose. Imp.
Clonsilla.'' the even money choice, was
landed in the show by Spencer.

Threw Stones and Her Parents Re
fused to Apologize.
Special DlFpatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 24.â A new step was
taken in the rows that characterize
county schools from time to time here to
day, when J. F. McKee. a farmer in the
Willow Glen school district, applied for a
writ of mandate in the Superior Court to
compel the admission of his daughter to
school. Miss Osee Ashley, principal of
the school, is the one against whom thb
action is directed.
McKee's pretty little daughter Abbie
was suspended on February 15 last. At
that time she, with other pupils, violated
a rule of the school by throwing stones.
Miss Ashley requested an apology from
the girl's mother and also a guarantee
that the rule would not be broken again.
Mrs. McKee refused to make any such
promise and the girl was refused admis
sion to school. The parents of the other
children apologized. Now the matter will
be aired in court. Superintendent Chlpman
advised the Trustees to allow the girl to
attend school, but they refused to do so
and stood back of Miss Ashley's action.
The outcome will be watched with inter
est by the teachers, as the move is a new
one.
PAYS IN ADVANCE.
Southern Pacific Makes a Big Deposit
in Sub-Treasury.
NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â Nearly $3,000,000
was paid Into the sub-treasury here to
day by the Southern Pacific Company for
the Central Pacific Railroad, in liquida
tion of a note of the latter company that
does not fall due until August, 1901. The
actual payment was $2,946,194 79.
Checks for this amount were turned Into
the sub-treasury and their receipt gave
that institution a credit balance of $2,346,
770 at the Clearing-house.
The note which was taken up Is the
fifth of aserles of twenty, bearing inter
est of 3 per cent, given to the Govern
ment when the Central Pacific settlement
was effected. It was secured by $3,000 000
Central Pacific 4 per cent bonds, which
were to-day turned over to the Southern
Pacific Company.
In Wall street It was said that the rea
son for the antlcipationof the payment is
that the Centra! Pacific bonds securing
the note can be handled with more profit
to the Southern Pacific than would be
gained by allowing the obligation to run
along until due.

DR. HATCH EXPLAINS.
Denies Story of Parsimony at ths
Stockton Hospital.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 24.â Dr. F. JV.
Hatch, member of the State .Lunacy Com
mission and general superintendent of tha
State hospitals, said to-day .that the
stories emanating from Stockton respect
ing the alleged parsimonious management
of the asylum there were for the most
part exaggerated.
It is true that the funds at the disposal
of the asylum have been curtailed, hut
this is due to a reduction of the appro
priation by the Legislature and to the
fact that the contingency fund fed by fees
from pay patients has been transferre-1
from the disposal of the local boarJ of
managers to the State treasury, where it
can only be drawn upon by order of. the
Lunacy Commission and Board of Exam
iners, and then only for purposes specilied
by law. Requisitions for small items
not necessary, as has been alleged, ani
the Lunacy Commission allows a sum
each month, in addition to estimated ex
penses, for purchases not contemplated
when the estimates are acted upon by the
Lunacy Commission.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

Baptists all over the State of California
have been encouraged by the announce

PRESIDENT T. A. BROWNSON.
tlon in California raises $10,230 within a
year. President T. A. Brbwnson has de
clared that it is possible to win the gift
of the oil magnate and has just started
on a tour of the State to call attention to
the crisis that now faces the college and
to the means of relief.
In a statement issued by the college
president is the following plain language:
It is not wise to disguise the fact;
it seems wise to emphasize it, that
the college has come to a real crisis
In its history. There must be in the
immediate' future a considerable in
crease of the endowment, or there
must be, for at least a number of
years, a discouraging existence with
out reasonable -progress. Not death
. but stagnation faces the college unless
its endowment shall see a considera
ble increase within three years.
The supreme need now is not more
students, desirable as would be an In
crease in numbers;' lt Is a larger en
dowment. It Is not new buildings, al
though two are really needed; it Is
more Invested funds; it Is a larger In
terest-bearing fund.
While at the head of the college at Mc-
Mlnnville, Or., the only other Â¦ Baptist
seminary In the West. President Brown
son received a similar offer from the
American Baptist Education Society, and
succeeded In meeting the conditions and
securing the gift. He Is confident that
he will be equally successful In this State.
MOST DESPERATE
SORTIE WAS MADE
FROM MAFEKING
LONDON, Feb. 24.-The first detailed
description of the desperate sortie from
Mafeking, made on December 26, comes
from the Reuter correspondent In that
hard pressed little town, as follows:
"The day after Christmas we mado an
attack on the Boer lines. Our seven
pounders, under Major Panzera, had been
emplacci during the night on -our left
front. As dawn broke a flash and a ckuJ
of white smoke showed they were in ac
tion. Shot after shot fell rapidly around
the enemy's position. As It grew lighter
the Maxim joined In. rapping automatical
ly, and to the right the armored train
crept slowly over the plain toward its des
tination.
"After that the attack developed with
marvelous rapidity to the east of Game
Tree (the fort which we were attacking),
and Vernon and Fitzclarence took up ti.elr
positions preparatory to a final rush.
"Away to the right flank Captain Coweii
with seventy men of the BechuanalanJ
Rifles was disposed to Intercept reinforce
ments on the enemy's retreat. The
armored train, under Captain William-!,
with a machine gun and Hotchkiss. ran up
as fast as the broken state of the line
would allow. The whole cf the right flank
was commanded by Major Goodley; to the
left of us were the enemy.
"The guns under Major Panzera were
escorted by a squadron under Li>rd
Charles Bentick. The whole, comrhande.l
by Colonel Hore. were dealing a rapid fire.
"Just before the sun arose the armored
train sounded her whistle. It was the
signal from Captain Vernon that he nas
ready to rush the position and to the guns
to cease firing. As the sun rose we could
see the khaki-clad troopers of the Protec
torate regiment rushing eagerly forward,
hardly stopping to fire, waving their hats
and cheering each other on. It seemed
scarcely seconds before they plunged into
the scrub which surrounds the sandbag
fort, and some one exclaimed: 'They are
swarming over the bags; the position is
ours."
"Meanwhile -the firing was continuing
furiously and we waited for It to cea=c.
expecting that the enemy would surrender
or be bayonetted to a man. Then thero
was an anxious lull. A staff officer said:
â¢Our men are coming back.'
"It was only too true. Slowly, sullen
and sulky, the men fell back, those that
were left of them, turning to fire in des
perate defiance now and again at the
enemy's works.
"An aid-de-camp came galoping up from
Major Goodley. 'Captain Vernon, sir, has
been repulsed,' he said. 'The position is
practically Impregnable to infantrj't and
Major Goodley docs not think it worth
while trying again.'
For a moment the colonel hesitated,
and we could see that the question as to
whether he should or should not again
attempt to carry the enemy's position was
being weighed in his mind. Then he
turned round to the chief staff officer and
said, 'Let the ambulance go out.'
"That was all. The battle of Game Tree
was over. How daring, how desperate,
how gallant the attack had been we were
only to learn later on. when the tale of
dead and wounded came to be told. Out
of the six officers who had led their men
so well three were dead, one wounded and
only two remained unhurt, one of the
two with his sword hilt bent by a bullet.
Of the eighty men who formed the storm
ing party twenty-one were killed and four
have since died from their wounds. Twen
ty-eight lie to-day in hospitalâ fifty-three
out of eighty.
"In the evening we gathered In the cem
etery to bury the dead. A long trench
was dug for the non-commissioned officers
and men, and there, because neither time
nor material permitted, they were burled
wrapped in white calico.
"We had done our best to break the cor
don which surrounded us and raise the
siege to communications with the north,
and we had failed."

TWICE SNATCHED
FROM THE JAWS
OF GRIM DEATH
Undertaker Helper's
Strange Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 24.
George Waters lives to tell how his life
has twice been snatched from the very
jaws of death within the past few days.
Indications in both instances point to
what many regard as attempted suicide.
Waters Is 23 years old and for a long
time has been employed as assistant at
James Taylor's undertaking establish
ment on Thirteenth street, near Clay.
A little over a week ago >.aters created
a mild sensation by drinking a cup of
embalming fluid. On that occasion ' he
was found unconscious by his employer,
who promptly summoned medical aid.
Fortunately his life, after several hours*
hard work on the part or the doctors,
was saved. When he recovered Waters
claimed that he had been suffering from
cramps in his stomach and that In his
eagerness to quaff something that might
temporarily relieve the pain grabbed the
cup of embalming fluid by mistake.
Early this morning Waters was again
found unconscious. â¢ This time he had
substituted illuminating gas. At the Re
ceiving Hospital, where Steward Borchert
after working over him several hours re
suscitated him. he declared:
"Shortly after I retired last night, at 11
o'clock, Mrs. Taylor came to my room
and aroused me. ! She said she noticed
the odor of escaping gas. I looked about
but found everything all right and re
turned to bed. At 2 o'clock this morn-
Ing I was again aroused on the same
pretext. -I looked about again, but found
nothing wrong. How the- gjra-escaped I
do not know and the idea of me trying
to commit suicide is ridiculous."
Mrs. Taylor, wife of the undertaker,
however; tells a different story. She says
that she called at Waters' room, which
Is above the undertaking parlors, twice
during the night because she had de
tected the odor of gas, and that , each
time Waters insisted no gas was escap
ing in his room. Yet when she found '
him unconscious at 7 o'clock this morn
ing both jets were turned on full blast,
when as a matter of fact he never has
been known to make use of but one jet.
Moreover, beneath Waters' pillow Mrs.
Taylor found the razor used in the em
balming department.
closely at him. but I think that I could
Identify him."
These attacks began with one upon Miss
Annie Koenig on Tuesday evening at the
corner of Eighteenth and Castro streets.
In this case the man hid behind a tree
and sprung out suddenly upon Miss Koe
nlg. He threw his arm about her, but so
violent was his attack that she was
thrown to the ground. He then made his
escape.
There was an attack made upon some
young lady on Wednesday evening, but,
while the matter has been reported to the
police, names are being withheld at the
request of the family.
The police are searching for the man.
but he is as Intangible as a shadow until
he finds some unattended young woman.
Then he assumes very material shape in
deed. The police believe that the myste
rious "Jack the Hugger" is a half-crazy
Swede by the name of Johnson, who was
mixed up in a similar affair about six
months ago and v.-as punished with a
charge of bird shot for his pains.

HUGGING JACK
STILL PURSUES
HIS VOCATION
Has Attacked Three
Young Women.
t
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway. Feb. 24.
"Jack the Hugger" is still at work in
Oakland and is making his nightly at
tacks upon young women who rind them
selves upon the streets unattended.
The motives of this individual are cer
tainly not robbery, for in the cases report
ed to the police, and there have been
three in the last week, the mysterious
man attempted each time merely 'to throw
his arm about some young lady and hug
hie victim. There has never been any at
tempt to snatch a purse, or to do more
than hug and frighten the young lady,
and from the reports made to the police
both efforts have been very successful in
tach case. The pecular part of these at
tacKs are that tney are generally early
la i me evening ana that the mysterious
hugger does not attempt to smother the
crlf . s . of I* 1 * one attacked, but depends uy
Â»ii a^ lll >' to make his escape,
.v, w Of the - jmact "s have been between
the hours of 7 and 8 in the evening, be
fore the shades of night have settled
r.eavJy. when young women are making
5\ ur Â£ . ne 'ehborhood calls or making lit
tle Hying trips without escorts. A shaded
ftreet is always choeen, for that affords
opportunity for concealment both before
and after the attack. In each case that
has been reported to the police the man
r.as been In waiting behlna come conven
ient tree, and as the victim w..uld pass he
steps forward, throws his arm about her.
and with a heavy squeeze he makes his
escape into the gathering gloom, leaving a
very frightened but uninjured young
woman behind.
These reports are becoming so frequent
a "i \? attract attention. The first report
m.ght have been some mistake or thÂ»
Imagination of a timid girl. The second
ca Â»? e made things look more serious, but
when a third was reported as having oc
curred last night the police began a de
termined search and every officer on the
force is looking for the "Jack the Hug
ger." who is frightening Oakland young
ladies.
The latest object of his attack is Mrs.
Mary Flaherty, who lives at 140Â« Eighth
street. Mrs. Klaherty is a young woman
and very comely. She was going home
last evening shortly after S o'clock, hav
ing made some small purchases from j
eom<Â» neighboring stores. She had the !
bundles in her arms and was not very j
timid, as it was comparatively early. As !
the passed the corner of Poplar and I
Fourteenth streets the shadowy form of
a. man stepped out from behind a large 1
Tree. He threw his arm about the young
woman.
Mrs. Flaherty was poing to allow noth

FIRE PROTECTION
FOR THEATER PATRONS
Commissioners' Suggestion That a
Fireman Be on Duty at Each
Performance Adopted.
The Fire Commissioners at their meet- !
ing yesterday morning were waited upon
by representatives of the local theaters in
response to the letter sent to them by the
Commissioners suggesting the advisability
of having two firemen in uniform in each
place of amusement during the perform
ance, so as to give a feeling of protection
to the audience.
After some discussion it was arranged
that one fireman should be placed in each
theater, he to be allowed four assistants
from the mechanical staff of the theater
to drill them for service should a fire oc- j
cur. The theaters will pay the salary of j
the firemen till July 1, when the depart- |
ment will be able to detail two men at its ;
own expense.
In view of the stringency in the cor
poration funds the board decided to dis
pense with the services of seven men In
the corporation yard, which will make a
saving of about $700 a month. Accounts
aggregating $7620 accruing prior to Jan

hall will not.be large enough to hold them
all.
Last Wednesday night San Francisco
Camp had a novel entertainment in Hein
man's Hall, at Twentieth and Howard
streets. Consul Commander W. B. Wilson
introduced W. L. Temple, the general or
ganizer for California, who delivered an
eloquent address on Woodcraft, after
which was introduced the pho-stereo com
bination which is being exhibited in the
interest of the organization department by
C. E. Campbell of Denver. Col. A number
of views were thrown upon a screen while
the phonograph reproduced appropriate
songs and addresses by Head Consul FaiK
enberg and other prominent members of
the order. This proved very interesting,
as between speeches and songs there were
many funnyisms. The many who were
present then indulged in dancing to music
by a band composed of members of the
camp, under the leadership of Professor
Shaffner, late of the Twenty-fourth United
States Infantry band. The affair was un
der the direction of J. M. Mallady, C. E.
Justice and H. J. C. Hartley. During the
evening fifteen applications were received.
In Elkdom.
San Francisco Lodge at its last meetir.g
received three applications. It has con
cluded its arrangements for the stag so
cial to be given. on the 9th of March. The
members of the lodge will pay a fraternal
visit to Oakland Lodge on the night of the
Ist of March.
The San Jose Lodge is .arrang
ing for a stag social during March.
The meetings of the lodge in Oak
land are always well attended. Â¦ The
Sacramento lodge has a member
ship of 350, and is receiving new members
at every session. San Diego Lodge reports
initiations and applications at every meet
ing. Los Angeles Lodge has over 4W mem
bers, is still Increasing and has one of the
finest halls in the State. Stockton Lodge
dedicated its new hall last Wednesday,
and it is a very fine one. There were pres
ent Elks from San Francisco, Sacramento,
San Jose, Los Angeles and Fresno. The
new lodge at Vallejo reports good prog
ress, and a lodge is in process of organiza
tion at Redding.
Stationary Engineers.
â¢ The smoker given last Tuesday night by
San Francisco No. 1. National Association
of Stationary Engineers, was one of the
most interesting events ever given by that
association. There were present In the
Association Hall at 20 Eddy street a large
number of the members and many vis
itors, who were delightfully entertained
by the committee, consisting of Thomas
Williams. John Leary and Edward Kelly.
Mr. Henderson of the International Corre
spondence Educational Bureau delivered
an interesting address on the work of that
body. Robert Carr of Chicago gave an in
structive talk on the mechanical indus
tries of the United States, H. K. Moultrop
had something to say about the advance
that had been made in the United States
in the past twenty years in those matters
that most interest the members of the
association, W. T. Bonney entertained
with some valuable information on en
gineering in general and C. C. Elsasser,
the national conductor, spoke of the pro
gress of the association in the United
States. Then followed a collation and
wine, and between "bites" . there were
stories, reminiscences and talks that
helped to makÂ« the evening a most en
joyable one. The association proposes to
have such a gathering once a quarter.
Maccabees.
San Francisco Tent, on the night of the
ICth Inst., had at its review a large num
ber of members and visiting sir knights.
Chief W. B. Greenberg of the Apache
team brought in another scalp and his
team Is still leading the Sioux. A num
ber of the visitor* delivered interesting
addresses and the quartet furnished vocal
selections.
The members of Pacific Tent are feel
ing quite jubilant, "for." as one of the
members remarked at the last held re
view, "things are coming our way." The
entertainment recently plven in Golden
Gate Hall in aid of the team rrgalia fund
was a great success and realized a sum
that will warrant the tent in securing the
necessary regalia and enable the team
to work with all the modern appliances
in about two wreks. on which occasion
a number of candidates will have an op
portunity to see the full ceremony. The
tent Is arranging for a "stag" party to
be given in the near future, possibly in
March.
Golden West Tent, at the close of its
review on last Tuesday night, when eight
strangers were initiated, had an interest
ing programme under "good for sir
knights." There were dramatic recita
tions by Daniel E. Hanlon; instrumental
music by S. K. Patton. and other features
that made that portion of the review very
pleasant.
Knights of Honor.
Last Monday night Union and Keystone
Lodges of the Knights of Honor paid a
fraternal visit to. Yerba Buena Lodge, and
a most enjoyable evening was the result.
There were addresses by the prominent
members of the visiting lodge and by the
grand officers who were present.
The visitors and members were well en
tertained by the sitting lodge. There was
an address by Grand Dictator Archibald,
remarks by Prof. Phil Prior of Polar Star
Lodge and by Joseph A. Moscrop. M. L.
Crowe entertained with a Scotch song. M.
Thomas favored with a select reading,
and a number of others added to the even
ing's pleasure with songs.
There was a large attendance of knights
and gentlemen friends at the smoker
given last Monday night by Liberty Lodge
in the Alcazar' building. Under the direc
tion of the "committee on noise," consist
ing of J. A. Johnston, Ben I. Salomon
and B. E. George, with the first named
as the chief, there was presented a good
programme that kept the audience to
gether till midnight. There were instru
mental selections by Cellarlous. club
swinging by Milton Bean, specialties bY
the little Bennett sisters, vocal solo by
Bonner Wilt, coon songs by Carr and Em
erson, an address on the order by Assist
ant Grand Dictator Salomon n.nd boxing
contests by Thurston and Vlckers of the
San Francisco -Athletic Club and Alex
Greggains and Joe Milton.
Glenwood Park, in the Santa Cruz
mountains, has Â¦ been secured for the
Knights of Honor picnic to be given on
the 30th of next May.
Grand Dictator Archibald has gone on
an official visit to Fresno, and before he
returns he will visit the lodges in Merced
and In Modesto.
Ancient Order Workmen.
Alta Lodge of the Ancient Order of
Workmen at the last held meeting in
creased its membership by the admission
of two stranpers by Initiation. This lodge
has arranged to give an .entertainment
and a dance to its friends in Mangels'
Hall In the Mission on the 27th inst. The

of Pacific last Tuesday three strangers
were admitted . to membership by initia
tion in the presence of Grand Sub-Chief

Mr. George Mayerle. 1071V4 Market st.. San
Franciscoâ Dear Sir: The glasses I ordered from
you by mall, much to my surprise, give me per-
fect satisfaction. When I ordered them I very
much doubted your ability to pult me, but I
must confess that I am delighted with them. I
have just had three sets of glasses made to
order, but since I have been using yours I have
filed the others away on a back shÂ«lf.

FROM REAR ADMIRAL W. T. SAMPSON.
Mr. George Mayerle, San Franciscoâ Dear Sir:
I received your glasses about August 14. Just as
we were sailing from Guantanamo for New
York. The glasses had evidently taken a long
Journey before reaching me, which they did In
good order. They fit beautifully, and I have
been using them constantly since they came.
Yours sincerely, W. T. SAMPSON.
Rear Admiral, U. S. Navy.
CURED DREADFUL PAIN.
Mr. George Mayerleâ Dear Sir: I write to In-
form you that the glasses I received from you

WATERY, PAINFUL AND SORE EYES
CURED.
Mr. Mayerleâ Dear Sir: My ejes have been
watery and were Inflamed and very painful a

when I first put them on, bur caus>d awful
pain after using them awhile; but your glasses
have entirely cured my eyes. I can use them
with comfort. JOHN SETINPFLK

Should not be classed among the many cheap
pretenders who Infest the city and brine dis-
repute to the profession. Madame's parlors are
visited by business men of good repute, anxious
for reliable information as to the outcome of
future Investments, and by ladles of high social
ttandlns.
Her parlors are so arranged that one party
does not see another while waiting their turns
to consult the medium. She Is the only medium
on earth recognized by the profession as their
Brishtoet Star.
Her power approaches the miraculous, and
she might well be termed the Witch of Endor
of the twentieth century.
To the Sick Especially
Her assistance Is priceless. Her "Revealed
Medicines," registered and copyrighted, cure all
diseases on earth, consumption, paralysis, rheu-
matism, all skin diseases, heart and nervous
affections. The wonderful cures which she has
made are the talk of the whole Slope.
If you cannot call, for thousands upon thou-
sands have been made rich, happy and healthy
without ever havlng-come to gee this wonderful
woman. Consultation by mall Is always most
successful and satisfactory, and all correspond-
ence Is kept sacredly confidential.

She never asks a question, but before you ut-
ter a word she tells you In full of all that
you are interested In, all dates, facts, etc. &h>3
tells you who are true to you and who are

stumbling blocks, bad luck and habits and
overcome all evil works, rivals and enemies.

happiness than all other mediums. Others are

Has no rival in her profession and stands with-
out an equal before the public. Thousands
who visited her and tested her wonderful power
are singing her praises throughout the land
and is
Recognized by Press and Public Everywhere.
She tells your complete past, your present
life, your entire future, of all loved ones, what
you should do to avoid trouble or disappoint-
ment, how to recover lost or stolen property:
she changes misfortune Into good luck, tells
you how your business transactions will turn

dicts important events long before they hap-
pen; In fact, there are no hidden mysteries so
deep that she cannot fathom.

From all parts of the world. Involving ques-

reply Is most gratifying. To the troubled and
unhappy her advice Is soothing and beneficial,
giving them that peace of mind that wealth nor
power can produce. Men of the world consult
her upon matters of business and speculation;
sporting men upon games of chance. Even min-
isters of the Gospel send for her wonderful ad-
vice and marvel at her power.

speculators and be advised: come all lovers and
win your idol; come all broken-hearted wives;

TO ARRIVE.
Steamer Movements.
countir's new enterprises began to employ in
creasing volumes of moneys and credits.
Then the inflated securities came to market
in New York In constantly increasing volume
until the panic on the stock exchangÂ« was pre
cipitated in December. It will be remembered
that much was said in financial quarters dur
ing .the latter part of last year when New
York bank deposits were diminishing of the
encroachments upon the banking business made
by the many new trust companies. But the
annual statement of the New York State Super
intendent of Banking has shown that the de
posits of the New York Trust Companies,'.ln
stead oi raining at the expanse, of the banks
were depleted some seventy-one, million dollars
for the last six months In 1599.
During the same,- period the deposits of the
New York Clearing-house banks fell off J165,
0O(i.c<00. The deposit account. of interior banks
showed that a large part of this total Bum of
$226,000,000 had gone into usÂ» in the Interior.
This transfer -of deposits was . without doubt
largely due to obligations incurred by New
York syndicates and bankers through promot
ers for taking up securities and properties of
the constituent companies in the great Indus
trial combinations of last year. Since the first
of this year as a result probably for annual
settlements, takings of account, etc... the de
posits of the New. York Clearing-house banks
have recovered to the extent of $SÂ«.818,700. But
new loans have been made in the same time
to the extent of 371,765,700, and , obviously not
Jcr use in the stock market. The flow of cash
has also turned away from New York again
and toward the interior. The possibilities
shown by last year's experience of the vora
cious absorption of capital by the ! industrial
and commercial expansion and development of
the country is the underlying motive of the
Inactivity of speculation. Here and there stockd
show strength on buying, prompted by good
assurance of an Increase in the dividend re
turn, but aside from this pseudo investment
demand, the market is dull and narrow. At
other points there is weakness and liquidation
on threatened integrity of dividends on account
of financial complications. The â¢ few stocks
which show appreciable movement absorb all
the attention of the professional operators, who
depend on daily trading for. their profits. While
money lenders can get 4Vi per cent or better
on mercantile paper or time loans, they are ln
dlsposied to place call loans at 2to 2 1 ,Â£ per cent.
On the other band, speculators are not dis
posed to avail themselves of a 2 per cent rate
for call loans, with the possibility that dimin
ishing surplus reserve will precipitate calling
of loans and marking up of rates.
Business In bonds has been on a somewhat
diminishing scale in an Irregular market. The
market for Government bonds has been un
usually active at rising prices on account of the
pendency of the refunding measure.

A Bird of Paradise.
Their parrot had died, and younp Mas
ter Tommy, with his little sister Jennie,
had just concluded the funeral services
over the grave of their feathered pet.
"I 'spose Polly Is In heaven now," re
marked Jennie, tearfully. "Yes." returned
Master Tommy, "I '.ipose h*> is." "He â
he's got, wings, but he wouldn't be an
angel up^there. would he?" inquired the
little maid, anxious about his present
status. "Oh!" cried Tommy: "he wouldn't
be an angel; only people Is that." "Then
what do you 'spose he Is now?" persisted
his sister. Tommy thought for a mo
ment. Then the llÃht of inspiration
dawned" on. his beaming countenance. "I
guess Polly is a bird of paradise now,"
he announced joyfully. â Crypt.

Nczc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24â The general specu
lative sentiment as reflected in' the stock mar
ket was a goo-1 deal obscured to-day by the de
moralisation ia Third Avenue. Active trading
resulting In a drop In price of
ever ten points Is bound to have consider
able effect in a narrow market, however pe
culiar end individual may be the reuse which
induces the selling. A rather violent break in
Tenne(isÂ«-e Coal had the same tendency. At a
matter of fact, traders were disposed t<) sell
etocks on the general outlook, especially the
reports from trade authorities that" price* of
materH!?, especially the metals, were yielding.
There ras also the. frar that the cutting of
grain rates on the trunk lines would spread to
classifications and some ratfcfr striking declines
in ti:e volume of bank clearings compared with
th* corresponding- period of last year. Re
ports by telegraph to thÂ» Financial Chronicle
for Cve <lays show a large shrinkage not only
at New York. Boston and Philadelphia, but at
Baltimore amounting to over 63 per cent and
at St. Louis of nearly 4 per cent. New Or
lear.s, bowevfer. expanded Its clearings over
47 per cent, Chicago 30 per cent and other cities
outfi<2e the seven leading cities 5.2 per cent.
Railroad earnings continue to show large ln
er"Bi>e(!, Â«ixty-cne roads, which have already
rf-p<j:t*>d for the twK-ond week in February,
B^O'fcir.g an avoTsgf imrpase of 5n.45 per cent
over th^ corresponding {>Â«riod of last year.
J?tror.g returns were made during the day for
ti)<s third week in February by the Paul,
Hocking VAlLey and Ilio Grande Western.
TherÂ» was good buying of some of Â¦the coal-
Carrying railroad stocks and a rallying ten
dency In the market, which was checked some
what by the renewed weakness in Third avenue
*nd the New Tork utilities in the final dealings.
The decrease in cash ', Fhown by the bank
Ftateir.ent was very near to the estimates. But
the *uppo'tSon that the large rate of loan
coi-paaFicn had been checked proved erroneous.
Chiefly by reason of the additional loans of
111, 035*, 300 the surplus reserves are further de
pJewd to the extent of $4,337.12r.. There can
I*- no doubt that the bankers ere influenced
In their liberality In extending credita by the
possibility of currency inflation authorized by
the pending financial bill. Sufficient attention
hat been called to th* fact that the bill au
thorizes an extension of the bank note circula
tion to the par value of the bonds at present
<}*pÂ«-Â»eit*d to Pf-cure circulation, which would be
a 10 per cent increase. But not bo nrn-h at
ter.tion has be*-n given to the fact that bonds
â¢ mount to t2i."..53fi.17(Â». while national banks'
otpitil amounts to $O<A<KXt.O<JO, which fixes the
limits of the bank note circulation per
mitted. The r^fuiidlng plan provides for the
Us'ja ol new tutide to the amount of the pres
ent premium on outstanding bonds, which will
be svailable for deposit to secure additioual
cin-ulation. The additional profit afforded on
circulation by the new provisions. It Is be
lieved, will Invite bank note expansion to the
limit authorized unless the premium on the new
boniJ? becomes excessive. .
ThÂ« breaking of the Stock Exchange week
by a hoi May had ?oiji' Influence in curtailing

NEW YORK. Feb. 24.â The Financier says
this week: The New York bank statement for
the week ending February 24 is marked by a
continuance of the upward movement in loans,
the expansion since the last previous statement
having been 511.035.9 W. This makes the total
increase since the opening of the year $71,766,
000, as compared with a rise of a little- over
$40,000,000 for the same period last year. Loans
now In fact are within $13,000,000 of the total
report on February IS a year ago, although they
are smaller by $45,000,000 than the maximum
record attained on March 4, 1539. The net de
posits are now $70,000,000 less than at this
time last year. ' The movement of surplus re
serves now is not different from that noted In
February, 1859. ' As the two chief factors In
swelling the available cash In New York banks
have beerc eliminated- In the stoppage of treas
ury deposits and the resumption of Interior de
mands, there seems no likelihood' of statements
of a different character for some time to come.
In other words, with the loan commitments
rising and money going out of the New York
banks as at present the surplus reserve will tin
subjected to a drain that will, reduce it to a
smaller fleure than now reported. But In
spite of this obvious process of liquidation of
excess funds money as yet shows little sign of
responding, rates being only nominally higher.
The heavy loan contracts may. have been made
In anticipation of a harder market later on.
During the week Just elapsed the banks lost
nearly three millions In cash to the treasury
and the interior. No detailed explanation can
be made of the cause of the continued rise in
loans. The stock market conditions hardly war
rant the repeated advances of $10,000,000 and
over per week. Commercial activity doubtless
has had more or less to do with It. A fact that
seemingly escapes attention Is the growing cir
culation of New York national banks. Since
January 1 the Increase here has been almost
two millions and the gain over last summer la
about four millions of dollars.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Feb. 24. âThe wheat market was
email and dull wrttr most of the-buslness In the
hands of scalpers. May opened HSUc o\-er yes
terday, because Liverpool was only slightly
lower In the face of the slump on this Hide yes
terday. From inttl*! figures, 66*Â»@SG4o, May
advanced u> .66y4@6SHe and then slumped to
66V*c, depressed by profit taking and then lack
of demand. Foreigners were sellers and the de
mand . was .mostly from . shorts. After a brief
period of steadiness at the decline some, long
wheat came out, principally because Liverpool
explained that . the I steadiness there was due
to a better demand from the country, and . be
cause bearish etatUtlcs were expected Monday,
and. the markets turned heavy. May closed Â»Â«c
under yesterday at GCc. . ........
Corn was weak with' wheat, but reacted, clos
ing firmer-wlth small country offerings and the
liberal clearances. . May closed firm, ftc over
yesterday, at 35Â®35Hc. ' â¢'.'...

BURIALS IN
CITY LIMITS
MUST CEASE
Joint Committee So
Decides.
WILL RECOMMEND. AN ORDER
TIME LIMIT TO BE FIXED AT
AUGUST 1, 1901.
Representatives of the Cemeteries and
Improvement Clubs Present Argu
ments â Measure Will Now Go
to Supervisors.
At a joint meeting of the Judiciary, Hos
pital and Health Committees of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday afternoon it was
decided to recommend for passage an or
dinance prohibiting burials '; within the
limits of the city and county of San Fran
cisco and . the time for -the ordinance to
go Into full force and effect was fixed
at August 1, 1901. The recommendation
was not unanimous, however, and when
the vote was taken Chairman d'Ancona
and Supervisors Comte and Brandensteln
voted in favor of the measure, while Su
pervisors Boxton and Tobin asked to be
excused until they had debated the mat
ter in their own minds. Tobin stated that
he might afllx his signature when the re
port of the committee had been fully pre
pared.
In moving for the adoption of the order
Comte stated that he was absolutely con
vinced of the unsanitary conditions caused
by the cemeteries and when the charter
of ISSO was framed Dr. Elllnwood had
held that the germs from the burial places
were the direct cause of numerous zymotic
diseases. Brandenstein seconded Comte's
motion. . *
In order to avoid the possibility of the
succeeding board rescinding the commit
tee's action the date when burials shall
ceaso was changed from January 1, 1902,
to August 1, 1901.
The petitions of the Western Addition
Improvement Club, the Federated Mission
Clubs and other organizations to. prohibit
the burials provoked a long discussion. In
which representatives of the clubs and of
the Odd Fellows'. Laurel Hill and Masonic
cemeteries associations took part.
Secretary. Henderson of the Western Ad
dition Club said that it was proposed to
set the date for the closing of the ceme
teries in 'the city limits at January 1,
1902; that the cemetertes occupied sixty
blocks in the geographical center of the
city. He did not think that the proximity
of the cemeteries affected the sanitary in
terests of the people living near, them, but
It was a fact that property values suf
fered. Judge Lannigan asserted that in
no large cities are burials permitted in
side the 'city limits and the attempt to
close the cemeteries was In the light of
modern science.
E. P. E. Troy said the cemetery associa
tions approved the work of public Im
provements and Dr. C. T. Cross argued
that the cemeteries did affect the public
health and they should not be permitted
to remain In populous districts.
G. R. Fletcher, superintendent of the
Odd Fellows' cemeteries, opposed the re
moval of the cemeteries on the ground
that it would be a virtual confiscation of
the property and the question should be
submitted to a vote of the people. He
submitted statistics to show that the
death rate in the ward in which tho cem
eteries are situated is less in proportion
than in any other wards. Mr. Fletcher
concluded by saying that the Supervisors
were about to adjudicate on a proposition
that invalided an investment of $150,000,
000. In answer to a question by Mayor
Phelan Mr. Fletcher said the cemetery
owners would not suffer pecuniarily if the
cemeteries were removed, but the plat
owners would. Fletcher claimed that clos
ing the cemeteries would cause their re
moval, but the Mayor- contended that if
they were the owners of the lots would be
willing to abandon them in a few years.
M. Gray of the Laurel Hill Cemetery
denied that the cemeteries were in the
geographical center of .the city and that
streets could not be opened through them
on account of steep grades. If burials
were stopped it would result In a piece of
waste land. The Richmond district had
improved, notwithstanding the presence
of the cemeteries. ;

The fact that the Supervisors' Finance
Committee has practically decided to
nTomnund that the appropriation of the
Health Department be cut to $20,000 or
J33.000 less than was estimated when the
new board was organized will have the
effect of closing many of the departments

CALIFORNIA PARLOR IS
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD
NATIVE SONS' STXVER ANNI
VERSARY OF THE ORDER.
A Great Gathering at a Banquet and
a Great Deal of Oratory and-
Music.
California Parlor No. 1 of the Native
Sons of the Golden West was twenty
five years old on Tuesday, having been in
stituted on the 20th of February, 1875, by
the < late General A. M. Winn, and the
event. was celebrated by a grand banquet
in one of the prominent rotisseries. The
decorations were simple, there being only
an American flag at the one side of the
head of the banquet hall and the bear flag
at the other side, while In the center was
a silk bimd, on which appeared in letters
of gold the name of the pioneer parlor,
the very foundation of the now great Cal
ifornia Â¦ order. There were around the
festal board about one hundred and fifty
members and invited friends. At the head
of the table sat E. Myron Wolf, the toast
master, and to his right was the Gover
nor and to his left Frank Mattlson, grand
president of the order, while at points of
honor were the following named distin

Successful Jinks at the Press Club
Imbued with a patriotism it could ex
press in no other way the Press Club ar
ranged a jinks for Wednesday evening
that- would fittingly 'demonstrate that
there was something more than a day off
in Washington's birthday for its members.
It was an excellent programme and one
well carried out. albeit under some diffi
culties. Franklin Lane was to have pre
sided, but at tho last moment sickness at
home prevented him from attending: at
all and so Judge Low Jumped into the
breach with the sprightliness of a mem
ber in good standing and ran things to
suit everybody.
The programme was one of song, of
recitation, of quip and quirk and flash of
humor, and there was not a dull moment
from the time the people were called to
riotous order to . the ; time they had to
leave for home.
Mollenhauer brought his violin and
Elayed for the audience as best he knew
ow. Professor Meaney accompanying
him; J. Warren Keane. the magician, toid
as much about the lives and habits of
those before him as they would allow.
Little Phoebe Gibson, a violinist of,
twelve, played and sang and danced, and
Norman de Witt Phillipls of still more
tender years recited Shakespeare and
trailed funny songs until he refused to be
further enccred. Homer Henley sang the
song he has just composed. "A Song of
"War," a piece of martial fervor and dra
matic climaxes and he was accompanied
by James Hamilton Howe, who set the
piece to music and harmonized it. Charles
Parent, the only man in the club whose
voice reaches below the basement, sang
his lowest: Tom Greene of the Tivoli sang
his highest, accompanied by Winfred
Gofl*. who afterward took the stage on
his own behalf; Charles Dillon told hU
funniest stories; so did Captain Leale;
John H. Mansfield played the banjo;
Scully and Maison gave a funny Irish
skit and others disported themselves to
the edification of the willingly pleased.
One of the features of the evening was a
letter from the Chinese Consul. Ho Vow,
regretting that engagements out of town
denied him the pleasure of addressing the
audience on the "Open Door."
Altogether rhe jinks was a great suc
cess; it was an encouragement to more
of the same kind. â¢-." -

$20,00 a appropriation has been definitely
paused upon, which will most likely be
done at to-morrow's meeting of the Board
of Supervisors.
Dr. Williamson says if the department
Is allowed $20,000 only there will be less
than *.0,000 at its disposal because in the
past two'months there has already been
expended $10,500 for Its maintenance. This
will allow less than $2500 per month each
for March, April, May and June, and the
sum is but a little more than is necessary
to carry on *the Central and Harbor
Emergency hospitals. Nearly $2000 is ex
panded monthly for these two institutions
and at least one of them will be abolished
if not both. . â¢ â¢
The bacteiiolopioal and chemist's de
partments will be the first to be done
away with and a saving of several hun
dred dollars a month effected.' The food
n.nd market inspection v.ill also be abol
ished. It Is deemed that the plumbing
inspection is absolutely indispensable be
cause of the number of new houses that
are going up and the erection of which
would be delayed indefinitely if the
plumbing inspectors were dismissed. It
is then within the range of possibility
that they will be retained. This depart
ment costs $325 per month, there being
four inspectors continually occupied.
The vaccination bureau will not be dis
turbed if it can he avoided, but the free
distribution of antltoxlne will have to
be discontinued although it has- ht<
splendid results in preventing diphtheria.
It may become necessary to discharge
every employe In the office at the City
Hall except one clerk to record death and
birth certificates, which are constantly
used !n court proceedings.
"I believe that- the Board of. Super
visors is making a big mistake," said Dr.
Vv'illiamson. "In reducing the appropria
tion for the Health Department. It will
have the effect of tying our hands in
protecting the health Interests of the city.
Th" board organized its departments on
a basis of Â£.0.000 for the six months, and
ft was expected that good work would be
done. The Supervisors cut us down to
l"3.000 and now they propose to slice onT
$13,000. leaving but $20,000. of which over
one-half has been spent for the past two
months. We have decided on nothing as
yet. but a meeting will be called and wo
will certainly be compelled to close up
most of the departments. We have
stopped all work in Chinatown, whicn re
quires extraordinary scrutiny in the face
of tl.e possible entrance of the bubonic
plague. The danger of smallpox Is an
important consideration and the health
interests of the city will suffer irrepar
ably with the reduced appropriation at
our command, but it appears to be the
Intent of the Supervisors to bring about
that unfortunate state of affairs."
