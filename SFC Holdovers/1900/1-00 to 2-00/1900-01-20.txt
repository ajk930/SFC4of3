H. B. Mi Torpedo Boat Destroyer Virago Off Flattery Light.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â A speech
sensational in Its Interest and
international in its importance
Â¦was delivered In the Senate tc
day by Hale of Maine. The
occasion of the utterance was
the simple question whether a resolution
Introduced by Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
calling for Information as to the recogni
tion by this country of diplomatic repre
sentation of the Transvaal republic
should be directed to the President or to
the Secretary of State. Hale made the
question the text of an impassioned
speech, in which he declared that nine
tenths of the American people sympa
thized with the Boera in their gallant
struggle for liberty against one of the
greatest powers In the world. He de
clared that the war which Great Britain
was waging was the most fatal blow at
human liberty that had been struck in
the century. He denied that the Ameri
can people were "in sympathy with Great
Britain in the South African war to
stamp out the liberty of the people," and
when Balfour In the House of Commons
made such a statement "he should be met
with some disclaimer from this side of
the Atlantic." He declared that the Eng
gllsh people themselves were not in favor
of this war, which "had been brought on
by a sharp Cabinet Minister engaged with
gold speculators."
Hale spoke with unusual force, decisive
ness and earnestness, even for him, and
his passionate* eloquence claimed the
closest attention of every auditor. Th*
resolution, which previous to Hales
speech had caused a sharp colloquy be
tween Allen and Spooner (R.) of Wiscon
sin, was passed finally as amended.
When the question was taken up a
debate ensued between Allen. Spooner.
Teller and Hale. The resolution was
finally amended so as to call on the Pres
ident, "If not incompatible with public
Interests," to supply the Information.
Spooner declared It was a piece of gross
Impudence to call upon the Secretary of
State for. confidential information, for
which the President alone was responsi
ble.
In a brief speech In opposition to the
amendment Teller said he would not say
a word that would be offensive co the
Government of Great Britain, yet hÂ« felt
hie sympathy go out to the Transvaal re
public in! its great contest at arms witn
England. Hale of Maine said he could
"not believe any accredited representative
rof the , Transvaal republic had been re
jected-by the President. Said he:
â¢ â¢'I should. deem. that a most unfortunate event
If It occurred.' I have heard that irresponsi
ble,' unaccredited persons perhaps. United
States citizens, have appeared in Washington
claiming to represent the gallant people who
are struggling for liberty, but no such mis
sion could : be recognized. I have* yet to be
made to believe . that any duly accredited rep

Africa has appeared before the President . o(
rf"**Â« PEABMANS CAMP, 11:10 a. m., Jan. 20.â Through the success attending the sortie by the forces of
hT~SI Lord Dundor.ald. the British gained control of an easy entrance to L&dysmith. The enemy's communi
cations with the Free State are cut. The bombardment of the Boer lines continued with great vigor this
(Saturday) morning. The reply was feeble and desultory. Warren is advancing steadily. There have been no
losses. A carriage drawn by sixteen mules was seen to dash into the Boer lines to-day. It is supposed it con
tained Joubert or a French general. The weakness of the Boer reply to the British advance causes surprise. Pre
cautions are taken against a surprise.
LADYSIinH, Jan. 17 (via Spearmans Camp, Jan. 19). â Everything is quiet. The position is un
changed and there is very little bombardment. The welcome sound .of the relief column was heard yesterday
from Colenso and Springfield. The heat is intense, but there is no increase of sickness.

LONDON, Jan. 20.â Up to 4 o'clock
this morning no further dispatches
have been received, but there is
every indication that a big figbt for
the west road will take place to
day, if it did not commerce yeÂ«
<lay, when General Warren was reported
to be advancing steadily at noon. But it
Is hardly possible that all the artillery -if
Warrtn and Lyttelton was across the
drifts yesterday morning. These indica
tions, as well as Warren's long march,
point to serious business to-day (Satur
day). *
According to the latest dispatches the
British have continued their forward
movement and are petting nearer at every
point to the Boer positions, while the
Boers on their part are rapidly adding to
the strength of their intrtnehments and
reinforcing their army from Colenso to
LadyKmith. This fact, which appears, in
almost every dispatch, suggests that per
haps when the Boers have concentrated
in front of Buller and Warren the pvm
r:pal British attack may take place, as
criminally intended, at Colenso. in which
rÂ« :;,-hborhood General Clery with at least
11.000 men is supposed to be and from
Â¦whose camp nothing has been heard for
come five days, but that fact has been
lost sight of in the intensity of the gaze
directed upon the big movement on 'he
left. General Warren has continued his
flank movement. '
Lord Dundonald and his mounted mm,
having done their work at Potgieters
Drift by seizing the hill which gave tne
crossing safely into Lyttelton's nanÂ£s.
have been passed over to Warren, who
used them on his extreme left, to the wr;st
of Acton Homes, where they have seized
some kopjes. This movement has a
double value. Lord Dundonald is now
actually on the direct line of retreat of
the Free Staters, and is edging around
gradually to the rear of the Boer posi
tion, the right of which is at a great hill
called Fpion Kop.
The Boers' position is threatened in
frcnt by General Lyttelton's brigade and
on the right flank by Warren's force,
Â¦which is said to be steadily advancing.
The situation last evening was as fol
lows:
General Warren, having made an ad
vance of five miles and having sent Lord
Dundonald to his left bank, is in posses
sion of some kopjes which command a
ravine behind Spion Kop. The British
troops are in a semicircle round the Boer
position, the northern end of the forma
tion, where Lord Dundonald's command
Is. being slightly bent back. Lyttelton's
brigade advanced two miles toward the
Boers' position at Brakfcntein, which is
about four miles north of Potgieters
Drift. The Boers would not show them
ec-lves, but the howitzers and naval guns
LONDON, Jan. 19.â The
Standard's correspondent at
Ladysmith wires that George
W. Stevens, the war corre
spondent, is dead. He died of
enteric fever at Ladysmith on
Monday night. Mr. Stevens

author of "With Kitchener to

on Mount Alice. South Tugera, directed
by the information secured by a balloon
reconnoissance, were able to do much
damage to the Boer trenches. Under
cover of this fire Lyttelton's men took up
a. strong position behind some ridges fac
ing the Boers.
With the force in this position it seems
Impossible that any great length of time
can elapse before a decisive battle is
fought. From the disposition of Buller's
troops it would seem probable that as
soon as Warren's turning movement is
completed and Lord Dundonald advances,
still in touch with Warren, sealing the
district line retreat to the Free State,
then General Lyttelton. supported prab
ably by General Hildyard's brigade, will
make an attack.
BRITISH CONTROL THE
ROAD TO LADYSMITH
LONDON. Jan. 20.â A dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph from Spearmans Farm,
or Camp, as the correspondents now de
erribo it. dealing with Lord Dundonald's
movement to the west of General War
ren's force, already cabled, says:
"His success gives us control of an easy
entrance to Ladyrmith. Our guns con
tinue to bombard the Boer lines, the Boers
replying but feebly. General Warren is
advancing steadily."
The Standard publishes the following,
dated Thursday, from Spearmans Farm:
"It is reported that the Boers opposite
Colenso. on finding that General Buller
had outmaneuvered them, crossed to the
south of the Tugela on Monday and set
fire to all the houses in the village. As
the force from Chieveley advanced the
Boers retired before them to trenches on
a hill in line with Colenso. Our infantry

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â
It is stated in an au
thoritative quarter that
if Montagu White is equipped
with proper credentials from
the Transvaal Government he
will be received as its repre
sentative by the administra
tion.
General O'Beirne's rejection
was ostensibly due to his
American citizenship, but
there is no doubt that the au
thorities would have preferred
that the matter of the Trans
vaal representation be left un
determined. However, when
Mr. White calls at the State
Department Secretary Hay
will see him and his status
will then be determined.
There is every reason to be
lieve that if his mission is to
secure an expression of sym
pathy from the President in
behalf of his Government, or
the intervention of that offi
cial, it will fail, as it is re
iterated that the administra
tion will not interfere unless
Great Britain should intimate
her willingness to have this
Government act.
Â¦ Allen's resolution, adopted
by the Senate to-day, was not
passed for the purpose of get
ting information upon that
subject, but to force the Presi
dent to receive Montagu
White,
The understanding is that
England objected to any rec
ognition of the Transvaal by
this Government.

the United States and been denied a hearing.
If that be true the sooner we are Informed
about it the better for the American people.
I don't fail to take notice that throughout
the length and breadth of the land the sym
pathies of the great American people are in
favor of the struggle which the Boers are
making to-day to preserve a republican gov
ernment against one of the greatest powers
of the world.
I don't doubt that the American people agree
with me that the war with Great Britain Is
waging is the most fatal blow at human
liberty that has been struck in the last cen
tury. I don't doubt that the administration
representing the people of the United States
feels to-day as I feel on the subject and as
nine-tenths of the American people feel.
Hale quoted from a speech of Balfour
in which the British statesman had de
clared that the Boer war had knit every
branch of the English-speaking race.
Continuing he said:
I deny, sir, that the American section of
that race is in sympathy with Great Britain
In the South African war to stamp out the
liberty of a people.
I deny that the American people are to be
tied to the chariot wheels of war against the
South Â¦ African republics. And when the leader
of the Conservatives In the House of Commons
asserts that he should be met by some dis
claimer from this side of the Atlantic.
I don't wish international complications. 1
don't wish war. I recall that we have not
been so much In love with neutrality In times
past that we could not speak us bodily for
Bulgaria, Poland, Armenia, Cuba and Greece,
and I don't know why It Is now that we most
speak with bated breath In favor of liberty.
I don't believe that the English people are
In favor of this war. I believe that the great
Queen, on bended knees, has prayed that tho
war might be averted; I don't believe that
the . great Premier of England favored the
war. It was the act and movement of a
sharp Cabinet Minister, engaged with, gold
speculators, who favored the war.
LOSSES OF THE BOERS
REMARKABLY SMALL
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â An Idea of thÂ«
high hopes entertained In the Transvanl
republic of 'the outcome of the war wtt^i
Great Britain is given in a letter written,
by E. Houthakker. assistant station mas
ter at Johannesburg, to hi 3 sister In

letter says in part:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C. Jan. 19.â There
was considerable excitement at
EsquimaJt last night and to-day.
To Judge by the bustle and mys
terious preparation, the strict
puard, the more than ordinary precau
tions that were being taken, it seemed as
though those in charge had been Informed
of some hostile de-sign contemplated
egainst the naval station or some of the
vessels in it.
The excitement began to make itself
manifest soon after the receipt of a cipher
dispatch by Captain Fagen, who. now that
the admiral is cruising in southern waters,
â¢s in charge of the station. This message
is said to have come from the Consul at
Ean Francisco. What It contained Cap
tain Fagen of course is not willing to di
vulge, but that he considered the message
of the utmost Importance Is shown by
Ti-hnt traronircfl nft<>r its reeeint.
On deciphering the message he at once
summoned by signal the commanders of
the other warships now in port and they
were closeted with him on the Leander
for some time. After the conference or
ders were sent to the torpedo-boat de-
Ftroyer Virago to prepare at once for a
cruise.
Messengers were sent to find her offi
cers, who were away at the time, in the
city, ordering them to at once Join their
ship. Steam was got up In forty-five min
utes, and shortly afterward she steamed
out down .the straits on patrol duty.
Because of the news received by Cap
tain Fagen there was also excitement at
the' fortifications. A messenger was sent
there, informing the officers of the strange
something and extra precautions were
taken. The guard was doubled and all the
guns were manned. Extra sentries have
been on duty at the fortifications for the
past week, and no one is allowed there.
Should any one be seen by the sentries
after 10 o'clock he is challenged, and ac
cording to orders received by them should
any suspicion attach he would be fired on.
At the dockyard all the guns are in
readiness and a big gun covering the yard
Is manned night and day. Sentries are
doubled, and all persons passing after
dark have to give the countersign. Steam
ers going Into the harbor have been noti
fied that they will have to signal with
their whistles. when passing fortifications.
Last night no vessels were allowed to en
ter Esquimau, and all persons in small
boats In the harbor were challenged by a
fleet of launches which patrolled the har
bor all night.
As to what all the trouble Is about, not
a man can be found to say. Whatever the
cause, the fact remains that there is con
siderable activity and excitement' at Es
qulmalt.

BOER ACCOUNTS OF

LOKDON, Jan. 19. â The Boer accounts
of the passage of the Tugela River are

Commandant Vlljoen's camp on the Upper
Tugela, via Lourenzo Marquez, dated Jan
uary 18:
January 15â Bailer* r second move wan a rec
onnolseance In force with an armored tÂ»-aln
and a large body, supported by cannon, toward
Colenso last night. A heavy bombardment en
sued and thereupon the British retired, having
wounded one of our men. No reply was made.
This movfe was a feint to cover extensive
movements up the river. Kaffirs on this side of
the Tugela have bern warned by the British
to leave their kraals, as the fight will com
mence shortly.
The second dispatch runs thus:
January 17 â The night was unbroken, save for
ellght rifle encounters between outposts, which
led to nothing. At daybreak the enemy was
located as before. He had not brought a sin
gle gun across the river. But from the ridges
of Swartfkop a batten* and a half of siege
guns opened on our position at 5 a. m. The
bombardment was probably the most frightful
ever witnessed on land. Frequently five heavy
naval guns fired simultaneously at one schanze
(entrenchment).

BERLIN. Jan. 19.â 1n the Reichstag
to-day the debate on Herr Moeller's
Joint interpellation of the Govern
ment regarding the seizure of the
German steamers by the British
warships was I opened. Herr Moeller
paid vigorous I expression must be
given to the Indignation felt at the fact
that the subsidized line to which the ves
sels belonged rhould; observe the strictest
neutrality, and expressed the opinion that
the matter should furnish the opportu
nity for denning the rights of mall steam
ers. The unloading of the Bundesrath,
he added, could have been effected within
a few days. The; delay showed want of
consideration for 'international courtesy,
and it should rbe made incumbent upon
the British officials' to announce whether
and to what extent their views in regard
to mall steamers had been changed.
The action, said the speaker, had ap
peared arbitrary, and it was Germany's
duty to demand security for her ships In
the future from all maritime nations. Ger
many was so neutral that even her arms
factories had been â¢ prohibited from sup
plying the belligerents. The present case
afforded a rare spectacle of the unity of
all parties. Great Britain had not always
maintained the neutrality marking Ger
many's present attitude, and Englishmen
should take care not to draw on them
selves, the hatred of the civilized world.
This, statement was greeted with loud
cheers. "
The Mhwter of Foreign Affairs, Count
Bulow, replied. He declared that Herr
Moeller. in . his introductory remarks,
had' Justly pointed out the feeling of an
noyance which the seizure of Â¦ German
steamers by British war vessels had
aroused throughout Germany and con
tinued:
The German Empire will not withhold Its
concurrence and pupoort If. with the co-opera
tion of the other powers. It would appear pos-.
flble by moans of "an International agreement
to get nearer a settlement of the disputed point*
of maritime law. At present the interpolator
Is only too Justified In saying that the maritime
law Is still very flexible and elastic. Is very de
fective and has numerous gaps which. In crit
ical moments, are only too often filled up by
the application of naval force. I would like an
agreement with the other Governments con
cerned to establish the following rules:
First Neutral merchant vessels on the high
seas or in the territorial waters of belligerents
â¢ hall, apart from the right of convoy, which la
not raised In the present case, be subject to the
right of search by the warships of belligerents.
Secondâ The right of search shall be exercised
with as much leniency as possible.
Thirdâ Should a neutral ehlpj when requested
to etor>, refuse to do so. or an examination of,
her pnpers disclose Irregularities, should the
presence of contraband be established, she may
be seized and delivered to a competent prize
court.
Fourthâ The term contraband shall include
only goods or persons suitable for use in war
and Intended for one of the belligerents. What
kind of goods come, under this heading Is a
matter for discussion.
Fifthâ Any contraband discovered to b* liable
to confiscation, whether with or without com
pensation, depends on the particular circum
stances. â¢
Sixth â If the arrest of a ship Is unjustifiable
the belllivrent shall be bound to release both
the ship nnd carco without delay and pay full
indemnity for the damage and injury sustained.
Count yon Bulow proceeded:
We recognize the rights which international
law actually gives to belligerents In respect to
neutral shirs, neutral trade and neutral inter
course. We don't misapprehend the duties
which a state of war imposes on neutral ship
owners and merchants, but we ask that bel
ligerents shall not extend their powers be
yond the limits of absolute necessity and they
shall respect the inalienable rights and legiti
mate trade of neutrals, and above all that they
shall exercise the right of search and the
ultimate capture of neutral vessels and goods
In sucTi a way as to meet the necessity for
the maintenance of neutral trade and the nor
mal relations between friendly, civilized peop
ples.
Taking up this ' standpoint we forthwith
lodged a strong protest in London against the
proceedings of the British naval officers.
We demanded, first, the Immediate release
of the Bundcerath, ' Herzog and General. The
latter two were immediately released on our
request, and the Bundesrath was released yes
terday.
Secondly, compensation for the unjustified
detention and losses therefrom.
The duty of compensation has been admitted
in principle, and Great Britain has declared
her readiness to give all legitimate satisfac
tion.
Thirdlyâ We laid stress on the necessity of
instructing the British naval officials not . to
molest German vessels outside of the vidlnlty
of the neat of war, especially from Aden north
ward, and Great Britain has given instructions
through which the stoppage of vessels and
search of vessels will not be exercised at Aden
or a similar distance from the seat of war.
Fourthlyâ We pointed out the high desira
bility of not stopping German mall steamer*
and Great Britain issued Instructions that such
vessels shall not be stopped or searched on
mere suspicion. These instructions remain In
force until other arrangement* are reached.
Fifthlyâ We have proposed that all conten
tions and questions not otherwise settled shall
be submitted ; to an arbitration tribunal .to
be promptly summoned. Great Britain ex
pressed the hope/ that arbitrators would not: be
required, but declared her .willingness "for ar
bitration in order to assess the ' claims -for'
damages. '<,Â¦"Â¦
Finally the British Government has 'expressed
its regret for the .incidents which have oc
curred. Â¦ â¢ â¢
This last statement caused loud cheers
in the House.
Count yon Bulow in conclusion said Ger
many would maintain friendly relations
with Great Britain, but: the Government
hoped that such Incidents would not re
cur, making it Impossible I for the ' good
relations to continue.

BROKEN BRAKEBEAM
CAUSES FREIGHT WRECK
Cars Piled" Up in Front of the Station,
but Fortunately No One Was
Injured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DIXON. Jan. I!).â A west-bound freight
extra was passing through this city at 7
6"' clock to-night when one of the cars loft
the track, derailing four others, scatter
ing them about the yard. All the* switches
and tracks were blocked by the smashup,
and a wrecking train was sent from Sac
ramento. The ground and track is torn
up for a distance of 200 yards, and the
trucks of some of the wrecked cars' are
buried almost out of sight in the earth.
A broken brakebeam Is supposed to have
been the cause of the wreck, as the car
left the track where there were no
switches to break the line. Passengers
for Sacramento were transferred around
the wreck, but the track will be cleared
and traffic resumed to-morrow.
The wreck occurred In front of the de
pot, and that no lives were lost is con
sidered miraculous, as a number of per
sons were standing on the platform when
the cars began piling over one another.
The local passenger. train is due from San
Francisco at 7:23, and it is exceedingly
fortunate that the accident did not oerur
a few minutes later, when the platform
would have been crowded with people
who usually attend the incoming of

SMOKE ISSUING
FROM TAUQUITZ
Old Volcano May Again
Become Active.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN .DIEGO, Jan. 19.â Reports come to
San Diego by letter from Strawberry Val
ley that smoke and steam are issuing 1
from between the rocks and boulders of
the basin of Mount Tauquitz and that the
people are looking for an eruption of the
big Volcano of many years ago.
Strawberry .Valley is now In Riverside
County, but was formerly a part of San
Diego County. It is a dozen miles from
the Hemet Valley reservoir and the scene
of activity is about ten miles beyond the
valley in tlte San Jacinto Mountains, one
peak of which is old Tauquitz.
The hotel in the valley is now under the
direction of Mrs. Keene. She says that
ever since the big shake on the morning
of December 25 the whole mountain has
been in a state of quiver, and that tho
rumbling Is being heard and the trembling
plainly felt all the time. She says 'that
the tremor is so great at times that water
and other liquids are spilled out of ves
sels that are set on the tables. These
continuous shakings have led to a sur
mise that some big outbreak will take
place in the near future. The place is not
very far from San Jacinto, the- scene of
the greatest damage. on Christmas morn-
Ing, and the people there, have been fig
uring somewhat on the chances of further
damage if the activity of the-old volcano
becomes more pronounced.
The writer pf the letter, Mr. Coveslze,
who seems to be perfectly familiar with
the country around Tauquitz, says that
the volume of steam and smoke issuing
from the ground has been on the* increase
rather than on the decrease, though the
tremors have been less pronounced. He
says that in the event of an eruption,
which he seems to think is quite an un
likely occurrence, there will be no danger
to the inhabited portion, as any lava
which- came from the mountain would
break out on the eastern side and run
toward the great Colorado Desert.
YOUNG MAN KILLED

man labored umler the hallucination that
the woods were full of gorillas, and three
times this week attempted to kill L. R.
Abercrombie. a neighbor. Twice Mr 3.
Hilstrom quieted her crazy spouse, but
this morning he watched for Abercrom

bullet did not miss Abercrombie' s head
by more than an inch. Abercrombie then
came to the city and acquainted the coun
ty authorities with the situation.
Deputy Sheriff Trullinger and Consta
ble Wlckman left for the house. On me
way out they met young Moore, who
agreed to accompany them and point out
HilÃtrom'e abode.
When they reached the place Moore sug
gested that It would be better that he
should go to the door, as he was ac
quained with the crazy man.
Mrs. Hilstrom appeared In response to
the knock at the door. Moore asked
where Hilstrom was and he had no sooner
uttered the words than the report of a
rifle rang out. Moore staggered back
ward and with a groan fell dead. The
body lay only a few feet, from the door
and the officers deemed it folly to at
tempt to recover It, as Hilstrom would
doubtlessly Bhoot them when they ap
peared in sl^ht. Constable Wickman re
mained at the place while Deptuy Trul
linger hurried In the launch ,to the city.
A posse left at once for the scene and
the house is now surrounded. Further
bloodshed Is feared when the effort to get
him from the house is made. ' . â¢.

retirement has been anticipated by the
appointment of General William Lndlow
as brigadier general. The President's ac
tion In filling this vacancy by sending
General Ludlow's name to the Senate in

In addition to his present duties, to take
temporary command of the Department of
the Lakes until a permanent appointment
can be made.
General J. R. Brooke, who was recently

likely to be assigned to relieve General

with a deadly weapon which was Com

cumstances of the assault are very pe
culiar, as. Feally cut Newman's nose off

ing the nose on his face again. Newman
further stated that he had some trouble
with Feally before the assault, j-

MARSHALL RELEASED.
Application for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus Granted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 19.-W. A. Mar
shall, whose frequent attempts to test
Marin County's pumpgun ordinance have
brought him frequently before, the courts,
appeared before Superior Judge Angellotti
this morning on a writ of habeas corpus.
A week aso Marshall, in company with
his attorney. Charles Wheeler, went to
Tomales. Marshall went hunting with
one of the proscribed pumpguns and was
promptly arrested on the instance of
Wheeler and brought before Judge Tur
ner of Tomales. Turner found Marshall
guilty and sentenced him to pay a tine' of
$20 or spend twenty days in jail. \\ r heeler
then, informed Â¦ the,' Judge that . he j was
about to swear out a writ of habeas cor*
pus before the Supreme Court, and asked
that Marshall be released pending the is
suance of the writ. The Judge thereupon
released Marshal on his own recog
nizance. The case excited some attention
at the time, for legal men questioned the
court's power to bring before it on a writ
of habeas corpus a man who was at lib
erty.
This morning Wheeler brought Marshall
over here and surrendered him to Sheriff
W. P. Taylor. The reason for this step
was that the Supreme Court refused to
institute habeas corpus proceedings un
less the writ was first issued by the Su
perior Court. As soon as Marshall was
Incarcerated Wheeler petitioned Superior
Judge Angellotti for a writ of habeas cor
pus, which was Immediately granted.
In his petition Wheeler claims that It Is
not within the powers of the Board of
Supervisors to prohibit the use of a re
peating shotgun.
The case comes before the court next
Friday and will arouse much interest
among the sporting fraternity, as on
Judge AngellotU'B decision hangs the
question of the validity of the cordially
detested pumpgun ordinance.
PLAGUE SPREADING IN
THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Buildings Are Burned Datlu in
Infected Districts and Riflid
Quarantine Continues.
HONOLULU. Jan. 12.-Six cases of
plague have broken out since last advices.
The Board of Health Is still working hard
to suppress the scourge. The Government
has been more than liberal in furnishing
money to clean the city. Fires are of
daily occurrence In Chinatown, the seat
of the trouble. Quarantine measures are
being made more strict every day. Every
suggestion the physicians make Is adopt
ed. No steps are lacking in fighting the
plague.
The island shipping business is in dan
ger of complete suspension if the plague
situation does not mend. The Wilder. and
Inter-Island companies have been talk
ing of laying their vessels off altogether
in view of the great difficulties in the way
of continuing to run them.
The steamer Xoeau arrived from Ha
waii at noon yesterday with startling
news for the island steamship companies.
The big island has established the strict
est quarantine yet heard of. Hiloites have
even decided that they will open and
fumigate mail before allowing it to come
ashore, and all vessels must go into quar
antine for ten days at Hilo before *hey
can land any freight of any description.
Letters will be opened, the envelopes
burned and the contents thoroughly fumi
gated.
The Noeau went to Waipio on Sunday
morning. Captain Wyman was informed
that no vessel could land anything on Ha
waiian soil without a bill of health from
Hilo. He went to Hilo and was fumi
gated and allowed to discharge. As *nÂ«
was leaving the new order was placed in
his hands, to be communicated to Hono
lulu. It stated that hereafter ten days'
quarantine will be insisted upon after
fumigation at Hilo and that mail would
be treated as stated. ;
One very important change in the
island shipping business that may come
if the quarantine lasts much longer is the
removal for the time being of the head
quarters ofi the island steamship com
panies to Hilo. If the vessels had
headquarters at the Hawaiian port it is
thought that they could do a large busi
ness carrying freight from there to
other ports on the \-arious islands that
have now established quarantine against
Honolulu. Deep water vessels headea
for Honolulu with provisions could be
sent to Uilo before they enter the har
bor here, and in this way the supplying
of plantations and other island centers
could be continued.
An average of more than 1700 persona
are being fed dally within the quaran
tined districts. The work both of pur
chase and distribution a3 well as the
work of listing the. applicants and in
vestigating cases of misrepresentation
in the matter of application, is all done
through the miL^ary.
One day's report of the numbers- and
nationalities provided for is a sample and
average of what is done daily. On Mon
day food was distributed to 1300 Hawa
iians, 225 Chinese. 50 Japanese, 13 Portu
guese, 10S South Sea Islanders and 21
whites. Most of the provisions are dis
tributed unprepared, the cooking and
preparation being done by the recipients.
In a few cases prepared food la distrib
uted.
Some Idea of the amount of food re
quired may be gained from the fact
that five wagon load* and seven basket
carriers were received within thÂ© lines
at one time.

REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 19. -The body
of Manuel Fialho lies on a slab in the
morgue at this place, and John Aviles oc
cupies a cell In the County Jail with a
charge of murder pending. against him.
Fialho was a Portuguese and Aviles Is
a Chilean. Both were residents of Span
ishtowa,
Fialho succumbed this morning at the
Poor Farm to injuries Inflicted upon him
In Spanishtown on Saturday night last
by Aviles, who struck him upon the
head with a demijohn. The row occurred
In the house occupied by .Aviles about
8 or 9 o'clock In the evening.
Aviles, Fialho and a man named Man
uel Brown had been drinking heavily.
A demijohn" of wine had been emptied.
In filling the glasses the last time there
was not enough wine to go around, and
so Aviles, who was pouring it, only par
tially filled them. Fialho took exception
to this and demanded a full glass. Be
coming angered at not receiving it, he
threw the giass at Aviles, and, as the lat
ter says, attempted to strike him with a
wine bottle. It was then that he struck
Fialho with the demijohn, knocking him
down.
Aviles made a bed for him on the
floor and made him as comfortable as
possible under the circumstances. Here
he nursed the 'Injured man until Tues
day morning, when the latter was re
moved to the Poor Farm, where he- re
mained until he died, never having re
gained consciousness from the time he
was struck.
On Tuesday Aviles was taken into cus
tody by the Constable and held pending
the result of Fialho's injuries. As soon
as Fialho died the Constable brought his
assailant to Redwood and placed him in
jail. An inquest will be held next week.
CRUSHED BY A
GIANT REDWOOD
Tragic Death of Hugh
Gallagher.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
LAYTONViIIE, Jan. 19.â The tragic
death of Hugh Gallagher, chief logger at
the Ueal Redwood Lumber Company's
mills, yesterday has cast a gloom over
the. community.; Gallagher,* who i 3 well
and favorably known, was superintending
the logging of immense redwood trees
from the mountain side down to the mill
chutes and had just completed the ad
justment of the huge chains on an un
commonly large tree. After instructing
the men to be cautious in liberating this
particular piece of timber Gallagher pro
ceeded to inspect the proposed route the
timber was to roll and shoot over.
He had only gone a short distance when
the huge binding chains that held the tree
snapped and with a roaring crash this im
mense tree, containing some seventy thou
sand feet of lumber, plunged down the
mountain side, gaining frightful mo
mentum with each bound. Gallagher's
effort to escape from the path of the roll
ing tree was pathetic. He appeared con
founded, running frantically about in a
circle. -
The massive trunk of the tree leaped
upon him. passing over his body without
josing a degree of its original momentum.
Ihe body was found ground and encased
into the earth to a perfect level. Its ap
pearance was beyond all semblance to n
human body.
Deceased was a married man and orig
inally came here from Philadelphia. A
widow and two children survive him.

General Burnham.
The family has been living here peace

Burnham has made a grave mistake. Her

She claims that he has been in asyluiu3
before and that it was against advice of

Captain Burnham was on his way to
supper at the Spalding House when ac
costed by a Deputy Sheriff, who, after
walking with him a short distance, told
him he had a warrant. The captain flew

MARTIN BERGEN, LATE OF THE BOSTONS.
NORTH BROOKFIELD. Mass., Jan. I?.â Martin Bergren, the catcher of the
Boston baseball team of thp National League, killed his wife and two
children and committed suicide at hi<= home here to-day. Mrs. Bergen and
one child were killed with an ax, and then Bergen used a razor to cut the
throat of his other child and his own.
It Is thought the action was due to Insanity. It has been suspected for
fome time that Bergen was a victim of mental derangement. In fact, some of
his actions In connection with his baseball manager, Labson, led to the supposi
tion at the time.
The affair was discovered by the neighbors, who found the body of Bergen and
his little girl by tne kitchen door. The bodies of Mrs. Bergen and the little boy
were in the bed.
Berpen was r? years old. his wife about the same agre, his girl eight or nine
years old and the boy a little younger.
KANSAS CITY. Mo., Jan. 19.â Martin Bergen made his debut In fast baseball
company with Manning's Kansas City Blues of 1^95, and he proved to be one of the
local manager's greatest find?. He came to Kansas City from the New Eng
land League and improved steadily while with the Blues. .His chief claim to the
affections of Kansas City enthusiasts was as a thrower. Very few Western
Leag-ue baserunners could steal when Bergen was behind the bat. Bergen was
known a* a melancholy man. He was surly, with his best friends and was a hard
player to handle, as hÂ«> was given to sulky moments and was liable to refuse to
play at any time without giving a reason.
.. . . ...
Bergen was well known on this coast, having been a member of the Boston
team when that famous body of baseball players paid this coast a visit a few
years a^o. He was one of the best known players In the profession.

Only a few people have any conception
of the work done at the local recruiting
station. They see the names of several
recruits published In the papers, but rare
ly think of the aggregate. Almost every
one is familiar with the fact that in tho
war with Spain Kentucky furnished four
regiments. Yet scarcely any know that
in addition to this Kentucky furnished
another army, almost as large, which was
composed exclusively of regulars. During
the war the Louisville recruiting station
alone enlisted 116S recruits, and it i*
usually conceded that the State outside
of Louisville furnished two-thirds of the
recruits enlisted in the State of Kentucky
These figures show that in addition to the
four regiments of volunteers Kentucky
also furnished recruits enough in the reg
ular army to fill three more regiments.
In addition to this many young men from
"Western Kentucky enlisted in Tennessee

SENATE PASSES
PENSION BILL
Occasion for Attacks on
the Commissioner.
WASHINGTON*. Jan. ID.â The pension
appropriation bill, carrying $145,245,250.
was passed by the House to-r*ay. It was
made the vehicle of an attack upon tho
Commissioner of Pensions by Curtis (R.)
of Kansas, who was seconded by Lentz
and Norton of Ohio and Robinson of In
diana, and other Northern Democrats.
All ln\-e!ghed against the lack of liberal
ity In the administration of tho pension
laws.
Tho Commissioner was ably defended]
by a score of members from both sides
of the House. Mahon (R.) of Pennsyl
vania charged that the assault upon him
had been Instigated by tho "pension
sharks" of this city who were robbing
the old soldiers. As a result of the lat
ter's disclosures, a rider was put upon tho
bill by unanimous consent, empowering
the Commissioner, in his discretion, to
withhold the fees of attorneys of record
In pension cases where he was satisfied
that the attorneys had not prepared the
cases under their personal supervision.
Mr. Barney of Wisconsin, who was In
charge of tho pension bill, made a gen
eral statement of Its contents. He said
the Commissioner of Pensions estimated
that the amount for pensions during tho
coming year would largely decrease, but,
owing to the influx of claims on account
of the Spanish war. he did not deem It
wise to reduce the appropriation this year.
There were 25, (KÂ») Spanish war claims
pendJng. The Commissioner thought Ova
or six millions would cover, them.

mRS. M. A. SWIFT, wife of Captain Henry Swift of the Thirteenth
Regiment, now in Manila, was arrested at the Palace Hotel by De
tective Cody yesterday morning and taken to the City Prison, where
she was booked on the charge of obtaining goods and money by fali-e
pr^nses from Mangrum & Otter, hardware merchants. Her bonds were fixed
In JlOO, or $50 cash. She is 40 years of age, and to all appearance is a mental
and physical wreck from her love for morphine. It was pitiable to see her as
she nervously Intertwined her fingers while being spoken to.
When arrested she told Detective Cody that she had no money nor friends
and had been unable to buy her breakfast. She repeated the assertion with
tears in her eyes in the prison. "I have no money," she said, "and haven't
a relative or friend in the world except my husband, and he is In Manila."
She begged to be excused from talking about the case, and said she thought
that General Shatter would get her out of her trouble. In the afternoon two
army surgeons called at the prison to see her, and said they had been sent by
the general. They had a long conversation with her, and it was evident that
they came to the conclusion she wa3 not responsible for her actions. It is
possible that will be the defense. They did not obtain her release from jail.
The offense for which she was arrested was for purchasing goods of the
value of 514 25 from Maogrum & Otter and giving a check on the First Na
tional Bank of Denver, purporting to be signed by her husband, in payment.
She received the difference, $13 75. in cash. The check was sent through a lo
cal bank for collection, and was returned with a note that the signature tvis
a forgery. Other firms were victimized in the same way, but have not taken
any action against her. It was reported that she had money on deposit at the
Palace Hotel, but she denied it. Tha case will be called in Judge Cabanlss'
court this morning.

OSMAN DIGNA
A PRISONER
AT LAST
Capture of the Famous
Dervish Leader.
WAS RECOGNIZED NEAR TOKAH
BIGHT-HAND MAN OF THE LATE
KHALIFA ABDULLAH.
Famous General Only an Arab by
Adoption, as Both His Parents
Were French and He Was
Born in France.
CAIRO, Jan. 19.â News was received
here to-night that Osman Digna, principal
general of the late Khalifa Abdullah, has
been captured.
It has been known that he was once li
the neighborhood of Tokah six days ago.
and several expeditions were organized
from Suakim, under Captain Burgess,
with the result that Osman Dlgna was
taken unhurt In the hills yesterday. He
will arrive at Suakim to-morrow.
Osman Digna, the rebel leader, who dur
ing the last ten years has kept the Eng
lish troops at bay around Suakim, caus
ing an immense expenditure of British
blood and treasure, is a renegade French
man, a native of Rouen. The authenticity
of this strange story is vouched for by the
famous African traveler. Dr. Schwein
furth, by Dr. Felkin and by several, other
equally renowned authorities on questions
relating to the Soudan. Osman Digna was
born on the banks of the Seine in 1836, and
was christened at the cathedral at Rouen
under the name of George. When about
11 years old his father, a certain Joseph
Nesbit, failed in business and betook him
self with his wife and child to EgyDt
where he died a short time afterward '
His widow, who found herself almost
penniless, contracted a few months later
a. marriage with a well-known Mahamme
dan merchant of Alexandria, Osman Dig
na by name. Having no children of his
own he became exceedingly fond of young
George Nisbet Insisted on his becoming
converted to the Mahammedan faith and
entered him under the name of Osman
Dlgna Jr. at the military school at Cairo
where the lad received a careful training
at the hands of the distinguished French
German and British officers attached to
the college as professors. In IS6O the whole
family took up their residence at Suakim
where old Osman Digna soon became
known as the leading merchant and prin
cipal slave dealer of the whole Red Sea
coast.
On his death, five years afterward his
stepson. George Nisbet, Inherited his for
tune and his business, and under the
name of Osman Digna soon acquired even
greater wealth, power and influence.
\\ hen the insurrection broke out at Cairo
in ISS2. he warmly espoused the cause of
Arabl Pacha, the rebel leader, who was
an old classmate and friend of his It
was on this occasion that he was elected
chief of the Sheiks of the Eastern Sou
dan. So great was his power that both
the Mahdl and his successor were forced
to treat the "French Arab" with extreme
consideration and to defer to his wishes
Osman Digna Is of Herculean stature'
with eyes of piercing blackness, shaggy
eyebrows and an immense beard. He has
lost his left arm in battle, and contents
himself with as few as three wives who
however, are daughters of the chiefs of
the most important and powerful Arab
tribes of the Soudan. It is to his train-
Ing at the military school at Cairo that
must be attributed the remarkable skill
displayed by O?man Digna in the con
struction of fortilicatlone and lntrench
ments around Suakim. fully equal In mer
it to those of the British royal engineers.
As the Soudanese have never anywhere
else shown any knowledge of throwing
up earthworks, their skill around Suakim
gave rise to the suspicion that Osman
Digna was but the norn de guerre of a
European, possessed of a very extended
knowledge of military tactics. The sus
picion has now became a certainty
PITIFUL PLIGHT
OF AN AGED
CAPITALIST
Raised Checks On an
Estate.
HIS CONFESSION IN COURT
NOW HE IS IN A PECK OF
TROUBLE.
Special Rlspatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Jan. 19.â Abram King, the
aged capitalist who is charged with loot
ing the estate of Stephen Hobson, an in
competent, while acting as guardian, took
the witness-stand in his own behalf to
day. He admitted he had raised the bill
of John Anthes from $15 90 to $25 ?0 for
work performed for the estate, but said
he had done so merely as a memorandum
and because he had expended $10 addi
tional for the estate. King said Anthes
had done paperhanging to the extent of
$15 90. and afterward plastering had been
done by another party amounting to $10.
He had no voucher for the latter charge
and added the $10 to Anthes' bill in order
to make it a charge against the estate.
IClng also admitted he had raised two
bills from Hobson & Co. for clothing,
from $7 50 to $17 50 and from $3 50 to $4 50
for the same reason.
When ho was questioned in regard to
his past life he broke down and cried. He
said he had been president of the First
National Bank, besides serving the peo
ple as Justice of the Peace, Supervisor,
Councilman and Associate Judge of the
County Court. King had not finished his
testimony when an adjournment was
taken to Monday.
Besides the present case there are five
other indictments of forgery against
King.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 20, 1900.
NEW WITNESSES IN
CLARK BRIBERY CASE
Ex-Chaplain Who Acted as Inter
mediary in the Buying of a
Senator's Vote.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 19.â The hearing
i before the Senate Committee on Pri\i
lr\â¢<F and Elections in the case of Senator
'lark of Montana developed four new
witnesses and continued to finish the tes
timony of the accountant. Rector, who
had been on the stand Wednesday. The
new witnesses were Representative
Cooncy. T. 1\ DutJer. a preacher named
Warren, who was chaplain of the Mon
tana House of Representatives, and a
lawyer named Cason. The last named
two testified to many incidental proceed
ings, which lent exceptional interest :o
their statements.
Rector testified that all he did In secur
(ng rooms was reported to the higher
authorities; and volunteered in this con
nection the statement that "in the case
of every man purchased It was necessary
to report to Mr. Clark." He had not made
fuc!) reports himself, being "only a pri
vate" and not on such terms of familiar
ity with the "big guns" as to justify his
approaching them. He renewed the state
ment, made in his examination-in-chlef.
that apartments in the Warren Hotel had
beÂ«n refused because there was no un
derground passage from that building to
the Legislative hall, contending seriously
that Mr. Clark's managers desired such a
passage. Davidson had. he said. left' the
money with him for Steele in an open r;i
x-elope. Money had been thus brought to
the room by Davidson and left for Stee'.e
en three diflernt occasions just before the
meeting of the Legislature. Rector said
he did not know what sum was brought in
by Davidson at any time.
"I only know." he said, "that we ism]
den!y accumulated a drawer full of
money."
He did not know what was done with
It. He did know, however, that Powell
Black had been sent out to "get" a mem
Iwr of the Legislature who was to have
$5000. and after returning he had said that
he had a hard trip but that "it was all
light." In another Instance Black hud
raid he had "landed his fish inside of an
bour."
Tne Tvltnrs? said he h.irt not told any
cne that if n- was not paid money by the
Clark people he wDuld testify as he had
dene, or that Mr. Hennpssy of Butte was
to pay him yoveral hundred dollars.
Rev. B. E. If. Warren, who was chap
lain of the Montana Hou^e of Represent
atives in the last s?ssion. was called. On
cross-examination Warren said he had
resigned his ministry in the Methoiisi
church after giving his testimony before
the Montana Supreme Court because of
the numerous scandalous reports that
were put into circulation about him. He
said In reply to questions that previous
to pcinp to* Helena he had had a diffi
culty tt SÂ»-Â»ct Grafs.
"A man called me a bad name," he said,
"and 1 knocked him down ar-d gave him
a thrashing."
Mr. Warren related the details of two
conversations he had with Senator Clark
while the Legislature was in session and
just previous to the election of Mr. Clark.
"I told him that 1 heard a Democratic
member (Riving the name of a member of
the House) say he would support Mr.
Clark for a consideration," said the wit
ness.
â¢â¢ 'How much docs he want?' Clark
asked.
" 'About $10,000. I think,' I replied. Clark
studied a moment and said, 'I can't do
anything like that myself, but 1 will have
it fix*-d. He did not, however, cay who
would tlx it."
Z. T. Cason. an attorney at Butte, tes
tified that he had been authorized by Sen
ator Clark to say to Representative Mar
eyes that Clark would pay him $10,000 for
his vote tor the United States Senate.
"He also said to me," the witness added,
"that Mr. Wellcpme was handling his
funds and would supply me with expense
money."
Continuing. Mr. Cason said he had seen
Mr. Wellcome, who had given him $50 for
expenses, and that afterward he had seen
Mr. Marcyes eever.il times, and after sat
isfying himself that Marcyes would vote
for Clark had bo reported to him. He had
not. however, made any suggestion of a
money consideration to Mr. Marcyes.
Afterward Marcyes had voted for Clark,
and on February 4 he had received a let
tor from Mr. Clark inclosing a check for
$500 for "professional services." This let
ter was produced and identified, and Mr.
Cason said that the only services he had
rendered Mr. Clark were in connection
with the Senatorial races.

Curious, Unfathomable Upsets
at Tanforan â Facade
Wins at 30 to J.
A broken-down, weary and dejected
looking crowd returned from Tanforan
yeftorday at the conclusion of the Fix
acts of racing. Empty of pocket and sad
at heart it had witnessed five heavily
flayed favorites led out to the slaughter,
vhlle the bookies fattened and made
merry. It would not have seemed so hard
could Merops have been returned a win
rcr. He was baxrked to a standstill to
land the third event, but the start ruined
hja chances. Facade, a3O to 1 shot, led all
the way, beating Grand Sachem, another
outsider, hands down. The other heavily
played ones in the race also met with the
same sort of hard luck.
Barney Schrelber's filly Sofala had
freshened up wonderfully since his previ
ous run and the opening three furlong
scramble for two-year-olds was only a

t>right for place honors. The winner
tripped off the distance in :35^, now the
track record.
Orion was supposed to b* the real live
one fcr the five furlong sprint following,
liiÂ« price falling from twos to even money.
I'o^s' sprinter showed considerable speed,
but was ur.able to finish closer up than
third. Gold Baron led to within a few
yards of the wire, where he was collared
and beaten out by Tirona, a 12 to 1 shot,
ridden by Henry.

MAnYSVILLK. Jan. I?.â lt is known
here that an < xtra session petition or
caucus pledge has been signed by many
Republican members of the Legislature.
The ajrroement is of this style:
The unxSerrloiied Republican members of the
Ix-frit-latur* asree. in the event of the meeting
of a nxxr.al session of the lyec!s!ature, to go
Into orra"niip and form a Republican caucus
for the nomination of a Republican candidate
for United t-'mtes Senator to succeed Stephen
M. Whit*. F-jch caucus to consist cf not less
than i=!xty-one Republican members. We fur
ther acre* to support and vote for in the rÂ«
tjx-ctive trnuses and In joint assembly the. can
didate who rr.ay be w!Â«*oted by a majority of
euch caucus bo constituted.
All vote* In fuch caucus to be taken viva
WV hereby authorize and rÂ»<juest the re
spective prffi'line officers of the two houses
to announce at the first session of the respect
ive houses at fuch extra wÂ»Â«ir.n that the cau
cus will convene In the Assembly chamber lm
mr-dlatHy after the adjournment on the first
day of such extra session.
W> also authorise and requÂ»?t said presiding
cfflrTs to Invite all Republican members r.i
the LofriyJature to attend and participate In
said rauous. whether they have slcned this
agreement and call cr not-
Th* ftp-nature* to this wrrrement and call
rif^d not all Â»x> appended to the same copy.
but thif< acrfpre^nt and rail *ha!l not fx* opera
tive fcr any purpose unt!! actually sitmed by at
lÂ»as? sixty-one Republican mersbers of the
Legislature.
Inquiries made In this city establish the
fart that the foregoing pledge did not
emanate from the Burns camp. An extra
possion advocate, who is wrll posted, in
clines to the opinion that Senator Cutter,
one of the leaders in the fisht apainst the
election of Burr.s, is taking the initiative.
Cutter proposes that t!:<- Bfty-flve Re
publican members comprising the anti
boss forces shall organize the caucus and
name the United States Senator.
Burr.s' supporters were yesterday ap
prised of the fact that the pledges men
tioned in the Marysville dispatch had been
signed by several members of the Legis
lature. Burns was taken by surprise when
he heard the news, but gave orders that
no counter move Fhould be made until
Governor Gage returned from Los An
gelfs.
Reference Is frequently made to recent
utterances of Senator Cutter. In this city
a few days ago he said with the utmost
frankness that he would never support
Burns. He also euprgrested the immediate
organization of all the forces opposed to
Burr.s.
The Senator from Tuba was annoyed
over the publication of a list which came
from th*Â» Southern Pacific political bu
reau. The railroad agent claimed that
Burrs had gained fifteen recruits since
the adjournment of the regular session
and that this gain would insure forty-five
votes or a sufficient number to absolutely
control the Republican caucus. When
pressed to name the fifteen recruits the
Southern Pacific agents submitted a list
of twer.ty-three members of the Legisla
ture, asserting that the fifteen converts
were embraced in the larger number. Sen
ator Cutter's name was on the railroad
list of twenty-three. The Senator did not
make an effort to conceal his wrath when
he found that his name was on the Mexi
can roll. His first Impulse was to blame
The Call for giving the list publicity, but
after deliberation he came to the conclu
sion that The Call simply exposed a
scheme devised by Herrin to deceive in
dependent members of the Legislature.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â The Press has
the following from Washington:
"You cannot deny. Senator Jones, that
a man who would advocate a modification
of the Chicajo platform would be de
nounced as a traitor to the party."
These words William J. Bryan ad
dressed to the chairman of the Democrat
ic National Committee in more emphatic
tones than he usually employs in conver
sation. They came at the close of an an
imated and at times excited argument be
tween the two men in the Metropolitan
Hotel.
Bryan arrived in Washington this
morning. Jones made his appearance as
soon as the candidate had had his break
fast. The two retired to a room and for
nearly an hour were engaged In conversa
tion. In their excitement they allowed
their voices to rise to such a pitch that
they could be heard by persons passing
In the hall.
Before the conference was half over
thoso outside, waiting to see Mr. Bryan,
knew Jones was Insisting that 16 to 1
should be kept In the background during
porters; J. R. Fraser, chaplain, and J.
Ferrettl. trustee.

tees. A banquet followed the installation.
the Eastern trip. The candidate was not
only opposing this proposition, but hÂ» was
doing it In language which practlca-ly
charged Jones with being a traitor to tho
Democratic party.
When the door was opened th* fluanea
faces and abrupt manner of the two men
testified to tha seriousness of the disa
greement.
That Jones will not be chairman again
Is as certain as it U that Bryan will be
nominated. If the two men can get along
until the national convention without an
open rupture it will surprise those who
know how far the quarrel of to-day pro
ceeded.

Rights Will Probably Be

The new Board of Education 13 not los
ing any time. It is proving quick to take
advantage of the example set by the
Waller board and by the last organization,
and already the introduction of new
teachers into the department is being dis
cussed.
The last board left room for thirty new
pedagogues. That is to say, it cleaned
up the department so that no more teach
ers than were necessary were employed,
leaving thirty that could be placed with
out any question. W. A. Kemp wanted to
fill that list, and Bergerot, Armstrong,
Cole, Gedge, Conlon and Head were said
to be with him; but at the last moment
Bergerot, figuring upon winning an ap
pointment from Phelan. threw the job
down and no appointments were made.
The new board has taken advantage of
the condition created by the old organiza
tion and in several "dark lantern" ses
sions held during the past few days has
given its largest consideration to that
matter. Three at least of the members
are seeking some way of unloading new
teachers on the department without being
censured. While they would like the ap
pointments and the obligations which
would be the natural accompaniment they
do not care to take the chance of the ex
pose that would naturally follow. Besides
they have already delegated the power to
make appointments and to accomplish
necessary reclasslficatlon to Superintend
ent Webster, and although that official
has already been turned down they do not
care to make his reduction a matter of
oiilclal action.
The work of the elementary committee
has been placed in Mr. Webster's hands,
but, already jealous of that privilege,
Director Denman has started among his
confreres a movement to deprive him of
his prerogatives. It is a notorious fuct
In the School Department that Denman
went Into his present position with the
avowed Intent of calling Webster down.
Webster's enmity to Mayor Phelan is also
known, and the combination that has
been worked up against the Superintend
ent is a clever one. Practically he has
been deprived of every arbitrary powtr
which was his; now, under Phelan's direc
tion, he is to be deprived of his routine
duties, and if the School Board follows
out its orders little will be left him save
his ofttee desk and salary.
Casserly, Denman and Mark came tc
getner yesterday morning in secret meet-
Ing. The one subject under discussion
was the appointment of new teacheis.
They also met on the day before and the
topic was the same. New curriculums and
the reorganization of the department ap
parently do not Interest them; it Is soleiv
a case of new teachers, and as many as
can be crowded in.
Another proposition which has lately
been discussed is the closing of the even
ing schools. The plan to abolish some of
those Â¦ institutions was Superintendent
Webster's, but the board has now taken
it up as its own and proposes to carry cut
the original plans of the Superintendent.
The Rlncon and Spring Valley evening
schools are to be closed, and many even
ing teachers are to be let out of the de
partment. The work done in the recent
secret meeting is to be ratified at the open
regular meeting on Wednesday next, and
startling changes are expected.

Special Dispatch to The Call*
TWO boy showmen were arrested
yesterday by Detective Graham
and booked at the City Prison
on a charpe of grand larceny.
They were Edward Patterson, also
known as Frank Baker, 19 years of
age, and Frank O'Nell, alias E. J.
Bacon, I*s years of age. Both claim
that they are connected with Norris
Brothers' dog show now in Oakland.
They are smart youths, particularly
O'Nell. who boasts that with a piece
of wire he can unlock any pair of
handcuffs.
Thursday night they met John M.
Connell, a rancher from Willows, in
the Whale saloon on Third street and
told him such a pitiable story of being
hard up that Connell took pity on
them and after treating them to sev
eral rounds of drinks and giving them
$1 each, took them to his room in the
What Cheer House. He Intended to
keep th^m there till they could get
something to do. Connell fell asleep
on a chair and when he awoke the
boys had disappeared. They had
taken oft Connell's shoes, trousers,
vest and shirt, and O'Nell stripped
himself and donned Connell's clothes,
leaving his own behind. They had
also taken his silver watch, $6 50 in
cash, a check for $60 and a receipt for
a valise, which they obtained at
"Wells-Fargo's yesterday morning.
O'Nell when arrested was wearing
Connell's clothes and he had to take
them off in prison and don his own.
"The old guy grave us the things,"
said O'Nell. "He was drunk when we
met him In the Whale saloon and he
would have given us everything be
longing to him. Tes, he gave us his
clothes, too, before he dropped off to
sleep, as he said they would Just fit
me and he had plenty more. He ask
ed us to take him home. We are
strangers to the city and don't know
where he made us take him. He was
the softest thing I ever struck."

12 60SOUTH ENDERS
AND ALAMEDAS
READY TO ROW
Barge Race Over a Five-Mile Course
Will Take Place To-Morrow
on Oakland Estuary.
The first rowing event of the year will
be the . five-mile barge race between the
Alameda seniors and the representatives
of the South End Rowing Club, which
will take place on Oakland estuary to
morrow. The South End oarsmen rowed
across the bay last Sunday and up the
estuary as far as the quarters of the Al
ameda Boat Club, where they left their
barge. The South End men have conse
quently had no practice together during
the past week, but they are well satisfied
with their performance last Sunday, when
they covered -the distance from the nar
row-gauge mole to the Alameda Boat Club
house in forty-five minutes. Â¦ The Alameda
seniors are also in good trim and feel con
fident that they can hold their own. They
have been going out on the creek for prac
tice during the recent moonlight nights.
The oarsmen will leave this city at 10:15
to-morrow morning and the race will bo
started on the arrival of the 10:45 boat
from San Francisco, or at about 11:05.
People on board the train leaving the
mole will be able to see the start and can
then go up to Chestnut street station,
whence a seven minutes' walk will br!ng
them to the Alameda Boat Club's house
in time to see the finish. The train is
timed to reach Chestnut street at 11:22
and the race will take between thirty-five
and forty minutes. It is said that there
are weak spots in the Alameda crew,
which a long race will test. The officials
are: J. R. Bockman, president of the Pa
cific Association, referee; J. T. Sullivan,
Pioneer Rowing Club, starter; A. P. Roth
kopf. Dolphin Boating Club; C. H. Smith,
f)resldent Alameda Boat Club, and Wil
iam Thomas, captain of the South End
Rowing Club, judges; H. W. Maass, vice
president Alameda Boat Club, and A. H.
Melletz, South End Rowing Club, timers.
The following committee of the Alameda
Boat Club has charge of the arrange
ments for the race and for the reception
cf visitors: W. B. Hinchman (chairman).
C. H. Smith, J. H. Timmens, F. S. Cone
and E. M. Hunter *
The South End crew will be made up as
follows: J. P. Foley, bow; C. C* Dennis,
No. 2; James Pallas, No. 3; Ed Scully,
stroke; Albert Sonnenberg. cockswain.
The Alameda representatives are: J. Lew
is, bow: D. G. Greenleaf, No. 2; W.G.Han
sen. No. 3; F. .W. Ayers, stroke; and E.
Hansen, cockswain. Considering the dis
tance to.be covered the crew rowing the
longest stroke will almost certainly win.
The annual dinner of the Dolphin Swim
ming and Boating Club was held last Sat
urday night at a downtown restaurant
and was a successful and pleasant affair.
The recently elected otticers were In
stalled, J. B. Keenan and J. J. Cronin and
others making speeches. There were
songs by Bush. Fenstemacher and Low
rle and Instrumental music by Mollca and
Lerond. E. H. Coney Issued a challenge
for a swimming match to J. S. Earls and
W. O. Patch for a medal, distance one
quarter of a mile. The Dolphins will begin
to. get a* barge ; crew . into shape soon.
Among the men who will be tried are
Dlxon. Kragnc-ss.. Lerond and Swedlund.
F. P. Waggershauser, who rowed stroke
of the junior barge crew of the University
of California in the regatta held at El
Campo on June 25 of last year, also at the
Fourth of July races and at Astoria, died
recently at Jackson. - He was working In
a mine when a cave-in occurred and
crushed one of his-legs. Amputation was
necessary and the shock caused his death
J. R. Bockman. president of the Pacific
Association; George James, captain of the
Olympic Club, and several other oarsmen
went over to Tiburon" last Sunday and
went for a row on the bay. President
Bockman expresses the opinion that the
new Olympic barge is the least cranky of
all the recently built four-oars, as four
men who had never rowed together before
sat her comfortably.

DUCK SHOOTERS
Weather Conditions Prove Unfavor
able for Sport on Marshesâ Quail

Many gunmen were afield last Sunday
In quest of quail and ducks but did not
meet with the success they anticipated.
The quail shooters were the more for

others who have shot regularly over the
Marln County hills enjoyed fair sport.
Many had their last shoot of the season

the last moment allowed under the coun
ty law. Many of the enthusiastic quail
shooters will now turn their attention to
Livermore and other places in Alameda
County, where the sport may still be en-
Joyed.
The conditions last week were against
duck shooting and the bags fell off no
ticeably from what they had been for
some weeks before. The birds were wide
ly scattered and avoided the preserves
of the clubs. Owing to the opportunities
afforded for shooting by moonlight near
the small towns the birds had been thor
oughly frightened during the week.
The Olympic Gun Club's Cordelia pre
serve was deserted last. Sunday, none of
the members caring to face what seemed
sure disappointment In going there for
birds that were known to have sought
other feeding grounds. A number of
members have signified their Intention of
trying the sport to-morrow. Among
those who will be on the ground are: H.
L. Miller, F. B. Surryhne. L. W. Harp
ham. J. J. Wirtner and R. H. Delatleld.
Bert Patrick and his companions, who
closed the season on the preserve of the
Black Jack Gun Club last Sunday, had
only ordinary sport. The combined bag
was twenty-three birds. Mr. Patrick will
try the sport up near Reeds Station to
morrow.
W. S. Ray. H. E. Rose and S. P. Brown
secured a launch last Sunday and went
on a shooting expedition Into Rlchardsons
Bay. They bagged six dozen ducks. Of
these twenty-seven were "cans' and the
balance bluebills. They enjoyed a great
day's sport, but are silent as to the flavor
of the birds.
Two noted sportsmen of the Northwest
are enjoying the shooting near the city
at the present time. They are W. A. Hll
lis of South Libbey. Mont., and G. E.
Lougee of Spokane. Wash. They shot on
Petalumu Creek, above the Olympic pre
serve, some days since and secured
ninety-four canvasbacks. Mr. Hlllis won
the Globe championship trophy for trap
shooting at Tacoma some months since.
David Thorn, C. A. Haight and W. J.
McLalne had an enjoyable day after quail
near Livermore last Sunday. The same
gentlemen, with James Maynard and
Henry Justins. will shoot over the same
ground to-morrow. They will have the
four well known field doga Nic, Flash,
Tom and VI to assist them in their quest
for the fant-flylng quail. .
George Franzen had a good shoot on the
bay last Sunday.
Ed Eyre shot over the Willow Lodge
preserve, but his returns were not heavy.
John Maynard. James Maynard. Mr.
Hopps and H. Justins shot near Alvarado,
but did not secure the big bags which
were common some weeks since.
F. G. Sanborn, Frank McLennon, John
Crackman. A. W. Wilson and Henry
Skinner spent Tuesday and Wednesday
below Hamlet on Tomales Bay after black
brant. The flight was poor, the sports
men Warning the full moon for the small
number of birds which they saw In ac
tion.
Phil Bekeart. L. R. Larzalere and J. B.
Burfelnd had only fair shooting on the
Spooney Gun Club's preserve near Alva
rado last Sunday. They will be out again
to-morrow, and expect better returns.
C. W. Hibbard and A. B. Truman left
on Wednesday for Bakersfleld. where they
will remain to witness the annual field
trials, which will be held next week.
The members of Lincoln Gun -Club will
open the trap-shooting season on Febru
ary 22 at their Alameda grounds. It is In
tended to offer an attractive programme
for the men who like to smash clay disks.
The California Wing Club will Inaugurate

allowed the weaker teams. The Whitney
brothers, the winners of the first handi
cap doubles tournament, will enter the
struggle to-day. They are on scratchâ
and are the only team that plays without
some- advantage. It has been quite the
order of things for the young lady mem
bers to play specially arranged matches

Yacht Club will be held on Wednesday,
January 31, for the purpose of receiv
ing the annual report of officers and of
electing officers and directors for the
coming year. The regular nominees. A3
selected by the nominating committee,
will almost certainly be elected, as no
signs of an opposition ticket have ap
peared. It 'Is understood that some
amendments to the bylaws will be offer
ed, one of which will relate to the ad
mission of women as members of the
club. It Is not at all likely that the
amendment will be adopted, as the Corin
thians are known to be strongly opposed
to the policy recently adopted by the San
Francisco Yacht Club. The Sausallto

HOUNDS WILL
MEET AT SAN
CARLOS TO-DAY
Frank J. Caro l an to Act for the
First Time as iMaster of San 1
Mateo Hunt.
The members of the San Mateo Hunt
Club will meet at 3 o'clock this afternoon
at San Carlos station. San Mateo County.
Frank J. Carolan, who was elected mas
ter last 'November before the season b">-
gan. will officiate for the first time. He
has just returned to California from the
Eastern States, where he visited all the
principal hunt clubs, picking up new ideas
which he proposes to carry out here.
Mr. Carolan has brought back an expe
rienced kennel man, several good dog 3
and eight hunters, and knows where other
excellent horses can be obtained. He pro
poses that all the members of the Hunt
shall wear the orthodox "pink" coat,
which is characteristic of the fox-hunter
in Great Britain. Now that the master
has returned the club will become more
active. It is expected there will be large
fields from now until the close of the sea
son, which is likely to be a long one. as
the ground will probably be moist and
soft until quite late this year. The con
struction of the new kennels for the per
manent accommodation of the pack will
shortly be begun, and the work of Im
proving the pack will also be taken In
hand.
On Wednesday, the 24th inst., the meet
will be at Byrne's store, on Half moon
Bay road, on the farther side of the
Spring Valley reservoir. On Saturday,
the. 27th. the pack will be laid on at the
old tollgate house on the Crystal Springs
road, near San Mateo. On Wednesday.
January 31. the meet will be at the polo
field at Burllngame.

mer and John Slebe. Alex Vogelsang, Al
Wilson and others of the old guard go
up to-day. The number would be largely
increased but for lack of train facilities,
as persons going up to-day cannot return
until Monday night.
No big fish are being taken at Point
Reyes, although a number of enthusiasts,
including Frank Maskey and John But
ler, have tried their wiles on the fish.
The members of the San Francisco Fly-
Casting Club look forward to a big de
velopment In the gentle pastime during
the coming season. Over 60 per cent of
the club's membership attended the first
gathering of this season. This is taken
as an indication of the interest shown in
the development of fly-casting.
but none of them have lost their love for
the sport.
The invitations to other guests not
members ot the club are few, but each
member is allowed to invite one friend.
The entertainment to be provided by the
house committee will rival all previous
efforts in this direction.
Paul M. Nippert, president of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs, has ad
dressed a communication to the various
clubs which are members of the associa
tion calling their attention to its present
condition and to a special meting to be
held next Wednesday night. lJis desira
ble that a quorum be present to turn over
the control of racing on this coast to the
National Cycling Association. Mr. Nip
pert urges the clubs to send either dele
gates or proxies.
A brief resume from a letter to the
cycling editor from Herbert V. Ready of
the Bay City Club, who is now in Los
Angeles, regarding the new track there
may be of Interest to local racing men,
who are thinking of going down there.
He says: "Track is eight-lap, board and
very fast. Covered on top with canvas,
which has twice blown off. Four thou
sand people present January 14. It is a
paying investment. Freeman and Lacey
are in fine shape. McFarland and Fur
man are not riding. McFarland expects
to get control of the track and run the
races Hardy Downing is riding well,
likewise Lawson, Stevens and Turville.
Lacey says there are several first class
amateurs here, and he predicts great
things for them."

The professional tournament held last
Saturday and Sunday on the Adams Point
course under the management of the Oak
land Golf Club was successful and pro
duced an exceedingly close and interest
ing contest. Though Horace Rawlins
thoroughly deserved his victory, plaj ing
good golf throughout the tournament and
beating the second man by six strokes,
the next four players were so near to
gether that on another occasion any one
of them might beat the other thre-?.
Rawlins- carried off the first prize of- $lO3
with a score of 16S for thirty-six nole*;,
or an average of 42 per round. Alexander
Smith was second with 174, winning $"A>.
while Melville and Stephenson tied for
third prize with 176. W. Anderson wan
fifth with 177. In playing off the tie, over
eighteen holes. Stephenson made 91, beat
ing Melville's score of 54. and won third
prize, $25. T. W. Tetley. though consid
erably behind his nearest competitor on
Saturday, pluckily played the remaining
two rounds on Sunday. On the first day
the professionals were followed around
the course by a large "gallery," includ
ing several ladies, but on Sunday the
spectators were much fewer, and Included
only two or three ladies.
It was at first thought that some of th->
amateurs of Southern California would
enter the tournament, but at the last mo
ment tlit managers of the event declared
it open to professionals only. It has boon
stated that any amateurs who might have
played in the match would have lost their
status as amateur golfers under section
S of the by-laws of the United States Golf
Association, which defines an amateur as
one "who has never within the jurisdic
tion of this association played a mater;
game apa.:nst a professional for a money
bet or stake, nor played in a club cciii
petition for a money prize or swoop
stakes." The wording of the rule Is. how
ever, by no means clear, as no one can
positively say whether the words "com
petition for a money prize" or "played
â¢ â¢ â¢ for a money prize" are to be taken
closely together. The contest at Oakland
might be said to be not a "club compe
tition." but one open to any golfers, or
the amateur mlcht save his status by ac
cepting a trophy in lieu of the "money
prize" or resigning his claim to a prize
<>f any kind. In Great Britain men of the
highest social standing play in the same
cricket team as professionals, and against
ti-ams made up similarly of amateurs
and professionals, skill in the game and
residence being the only things consid
ered. It is also held that a man may b<*
a professional cricket player, footballer
or billiardist and an amateur golfer, if
he plays golf as a recreation, and not as
a means of livelihood. The essential point
is this: If a man livc-s by or makes profit
of his skill in a game he'is a professional,
end is barred from amateur contests be
cause he is likely to introduce profession
al ideas into the sport, and to do what
ever puts most money into his pocket. If
a man gets his living by a profession or
trade, and plays a game as a recreation
and because he likes it, he is an amateur.
Hence a professional runner or pugilist
might be an amateur golfer! But in the
United States the accepted rule Is that a
professional in one sport is a professional
in all.
On the invitation of James Melville, In
structor on the links of the Hotel iM
Monte, the professionals who played m
the Oakland tournament went down to
Del Monte last Monday.
There will be a golf cotillon at the Oak
land clubhouse to-night, at which all
members are requested to appear in golf

bers. Is under the management of Mrs.
P. E. Bowles and Mrs. J. H. T. Watkir.

On Monday there will be a ladies' nar.d

The first game of the home-and-home
match between teams of eight men each

lists of their teams. In which lists the
players will be numbered according to
their strength. No. lof the Oakland team

cisco eight. No. 1 against No. 2. and so on.
The contest will be over eighteen holes,
match play. The second game of the first
match will be played on the Oakland links
on Saturday. February 3. The scores of
the two games will then be added, and
the team which wins the first match will
be entitled to hold the trophy until the
second match takes p!ace in the spring.
The San Francisco representatives will

phcr. R. B. Gaylord, H. B. Goodwin, E.
Conde Jones. L. O. Kellogg. John Law

D. Pillsbury and A. B. Williamson. It is
possible that John Lawson may not be
able to play, as he met with an awkward
accident while playing polo at Burlin
irame. his pony rolling over him and in
juring his knee.
Next Friday and Saturday a tournament
under the management of the Southern
California Golf Association will be held
on the links Â«>f the Pasadena Country
Club, at which the women's champion
ship of Southern California will be de
cided. The qualifying round will be at

Hjgh May. while playing in a foursome
recently on the links of the Los Angeles
Country Club, made "Dinky," the fifth
hole, in one stroke. The length of the
hole is set down as 113 yards, but as the
taring ground Is on the top of a hill over
looking the green the air line is consider
ably less than a hundred yards. This Is
the first time that any hole on the Coun
try < "lub's links has been made in one.
On October 21 of last year C. P. Hubbard
of the Oakland Golf Club made "Gully,"
the second hole of the "short course " in
a Finrle stroke, its length being ICO yards
and only the f-dge of the putting green be-
In* visible- from the teeing ground. Wal

Catalina Island course on the drive.
LUXOR, FLEETEST GREYHOUND NOW IN TRAINING.
Photographed expressly for The Call by C. J. Adams.
OF the dogs seen in competition at the local coursing parks recently, pride of
place is easily held by Curtis & Sons' splendid white and black greyhound
Luxor. By some authorities he is pronounced the most .representative
dog of the breed cunning here. He will be the principal representative of
his owner in tlje rich John Grace challenge cup stake at Union Park next
month and will make a strong bid for the big purse. Luxor is by Skyrocket-
Wave and Is nearly three years old. He defeated Young America in a match
on February 5; won a 44-dog stake April 30; won the special stake on Thanksgiv
ing day; the open stake December 10, and divided with Cavalier, his kennel
mate, December 31. He had the stake at Union Park last Sunday apparently
at his mercy, but was withdrawn as it was thought he showed signs, of weak
ness and afterward the liniment which was used in the rubbing-down process
was blamed for his actions.
San Mateo Coursing Park will reopen
on February 4 under new management
and another bid will be made for the
patronage of coursing men and of the
public. The control of the park has been
placed in the hands of D. J. Tobin, who
will try to score a success where others
failed. He claims the support of a num
ber of coursing men and is sanguine of
success. The draw for the first day's
coursing will be held on Wednesday, the
31st inst. It was intended to -offer the
responsible position of judge to John
Grace Jr.. who scored a marked success
at the last meeting; but his serious illness
would prevent his accepting.
The management of Union Coursing
Park offers an attractive programme for
to-day and to-morrow. An open stake
with eighty-eight high-class dogs and a
sapling stake with twenty-six prospective
champions entered forms the card. Among
the dogs in the open stake are: Sara,
Cash, Sweet Emma, Theron, Warship,
Kid McCoy, Royal Anne, Lucky Dog,
Rock Island Boy, lowa Maid, Beacon,
Royal Flush, Vanity Fair, O'Hara, Bohe,
Flying Fox and Diablo. Coursing will
commence each day upon the arrival of
the 10:15 a. m. train. The 1:25 p. m. train
for Tanforan will stop at the park this
afternoon.
The stake at Ingleside is for beaten
dogs, and an overllowing entry was re
ceived. The stake was nnally limited to
11- dogs, which number will go to the
blips to-day.
Pat Morgan, who was prominently iden
tiru-d with coursing on tnis coast until he
volunteered to light for his country in the
Philippines, is back in the sport again.
He has Lucretia Borgia and Lawton'a
Brigade (.the latter named apparently in
memory of fighting days) entered in the
open stake at Union Park this week. They
are by Van Knapp â Just Eclipsed, being
of the same litter as James Hurley's Pat
Horgan, a most promising young grey
hound.
Eugene Geary will start his young dog
Ireland this week. He is by Emln Pasha â
Bonnie Lass. Of this litter Palo Alto and
Bonnie Pasha have started, and have
shown themselves high-class performers.
Dan Riordan has lost his black dog
puppy by St. Lawrence â Daisy II through
being run over by a train. He was a fine
loolung greyhound and showed much
promise.
J. M. Halton. manager of the Pasha
Kennels, is particularly sweet on a For
Freedomâ Miller's Rabble sapling. He is
solid black, with white points, and al
though only three months old is of splen
did size and great substance. He is one
of the most promising young greyhounds
on the coast.
J. P. Thrift has a lot of highly bred
puppies at his Fruitvale* kennels, which
will soon be ready for competition. His
favorite is a Dakotaâ Lurllne puppy. All
coursing men who have seen it are struck
by its remarkable resemblance to For
Freedom. He has the markings of the
latter down to the smallest detail and is
built on the same lines. "Johnny" Maher
has the remainder of the litter. They
are all promising and will be ready to
run in a puppy stake in April.
Ralph Taylor has a number of For Free
domâBeauty Spot puppies, which are
doing well. They have recovered from dis
temper and are commencing to fill out
into racy lines.
Mr. Thrift also has a Hughle â Grass
hopper puppy of great promise. He is
M.-ic-k. with white markings, and is big
and strong. He will soon be ready for
competition.
John Klein has purchased three puppies
from S. W. Smith, which in breeding and
quality should , develop into stake win
ners. They are' by the great dog Vigilant
out of Sans Souci. She is by Emm Pasha
âVenture. One is a black dog. weighing
sixty pounds, while another is a counter
part of Hugh Lynch's black wonder, Lot
tie M.
Bartels Bros.' Winning Style, which was
imported from Ireland, has whelped thir
teen puppies to the same owner's Hughle,
imp. Eight of the litter are living.
"Billy" Murphy will fill the position of
Judge at Stockton, vice "Jack Sheehan,

last Monday. Frank Brown also tried out
at the same time f-ome Border Ruffian â
Gladys Pasha youngsters.
Will Thompson is giving Flora McDon
ald a special preparation for the John

The San Francisco Call, owned by John
D. Spreckels, a man pecuniarily as well
as morally responsible for the utterances
of his paper, says Mayor Phelan is guilty
of a felonyâ charges him with having en
tered into an ante-election contract to de
liver control of the Police Department to
A. M. Lawrence of the Examiner. The
accusation is made in bold-faced type,
and the paper that makes It asks tlie
Mayor to sue it for libeL The Mayor does
not respond by instituting suit against
the man who deliberately prefers these
charges, but satisfies himself and hi 3 cr
gan, the Examiner, by "scorning the at
tacks of viciously partisan papers." He
alleges that efforts to exact promises
from him before election in the Interest
of The Call proprietor were rebuked: is
free to say that he did advise with the
Examiner In making his appointmenta;
that from the first he was determined to
clean out the "upper office" (that of
Chief) in the Police Department, etc. "I
would not," he says, "think of suing a
paper for libel under such circumstance*,
because the verdict at the polls is the
best vindication a man may have." In>
this the Mayor is mistaken: success at
the polls is not always the best vindica
tion a man may have. Much depends
upon the methods employed In achieving
that success. All this aside, the quarrel
as It stands is one calculated to humiliate
a city so lately pledged to a broader and
better and more progressive life.

It is no ordinary contest that Is being
waged over the appointment of Chief of
Police at San Francisco. At first our
eympathies were with Esolaâ the candi
date of the Examiner and of Mayor Phe
lan. But we have ceased to regard It as
a newspaper battle and are forced to the
conclusion from developments to date
that Esola is an unfit man for the place.
Also, that the supposed immaculate
Mayor of the metropolis and the disrepu
table editor of the Examiner are parties
to a conspiracy to elect him. The charges
against Esola are of serious character.
If they are true they should disqualify
him from the holding of any position of
trust. Evidently the man who has made
these charges believes he can substanti
ate them. Without doubt plans were laid
to whitewash Esola by the Police Com
missioners Monday evening without per
mitting the accuser of the candidate to
produce the evidence In the case. That
scheme miscarried and there is to be a
hearing. In connection with this matter
the Bulletin makes out a good case of
forgery against the Examiner. Also, the
Bulletin declares that Mayor Phelan gave

to the Examiner a list of witnesses that
he had been informed would support the
charges against Esola, and that every in
fluence that disreputable sheet could em

ing testimony In the case. It is a very In
teresting affair throughout and it puts
James D. Phelan. Mayor of San Fran
cisco, in a very close place. At best he
now appears to bÂ» guilty of double deal
ing. While protesting entire Independ
ence In his official acts he appears now
to be under obligations to the editor of
the Examiner In the making of this most
Important appointment. This will go far
to shake the confidence the people, not
only of San Francisco, but of the entire
State, have felt in him. If half that is
charged against Esola is proven true,
Mayor Phelan cannot consent to his ap
pointment as Chief of Police of San Fran

ligations to the candidate's chief backer.

We are willing, and even anxious, to

in such acrimony and big type. While
a great many are ready to acquit him of
penal offenses, and even turpitude, no
body Is likely to be Impressed with his
repeated and heated denial of any under
standing as to Esola. The facts are that
the commission which he selected, as its
initiatory act, proposed to appoint a3
Chief of Police a man whose only call
on the position, so far as the public can
see, is the championship of the Mayor
and his close personal and Journalistic
/riend. Certainly there is no record of
the man to warrant appointment on his
merits. There are even charges against
him of so grave a nature that unless they
are utterly and strikingly disproved
would render his appointment incompat
ible with adequate public service. This
man is so intrenched that notwithstand
ing the storm that has been raised, there
is still a chance of his appointment. The
Mayor's tedious and retaliatory defense,
in the face of these facts, we very much
fear, will not wholly quiet the public ap

CIVIL SERVICE APPOINTEES.
Attorney Squires Says the "Push" Is
in and Cannot Be Dislodged.
Editor of The Call: Your editorial of
this morning in which you deprecate tlio
trend of civil service reform in this city
is a clear and correct statement of the
law and facts as far as you go. There i<*.
however, a word or two which, with your
permission, I should like to add to it.
In my controversy with Henry N. Clem
ent in November last I said: "As article 13
(of the charter) stands it Is manifestly a
farce. It lets 'the push' In on January
S in a body and retains them Indefinitely,
or at least until the officials who appoint
them retire from office. The constitution
limits the terms of all appointees under
the civil service rules to four years, thus
taking the very pith out of thÂ© whole
merit system."
The last sentence of this, as you have
demonstrated, describes the situation ex
actly as It existsat present. The four-yeor
limit applies to all officials in the State of
California, and perpetual tenure during
good behavior can only be established by
constant reappointment or a constitu
tional amendment.
In his last communication to you Mr.
Clement said: "Mr. Squires evident, v
questions the validity of that part of the
civil service law which provides for non
removal of faithful appointees during
good behavior. When that question la
raised it will be time to meet it."
The Supreme Court has raised the ques
tion, as you have pointed out. in Patton
vs. Board of Health. Mr. Clement should
now appear at left center and unload him
self. The curtain is up and the orchestra
has finished the opening overture. In
other words, his "time" is up.
Mr. Clement in one of his "replies" do
clared that "thf> push" would not set in
on January 8. Permit me to call your at
tention to the fact that "the push" is :Â»â
not only "the push" of the various of
ficials elected, but "the push" of Mayor
Phelan himself, and that of the rommls
sions and boards which he has appoint*--!.
Not only this. Notwithstanding th*
Civil Service Commission has generously
forced permission on all .officials to ap
point for sixty days, it is already talkirsr
about passing "the push" in carload lots,
or. what is better, "as a whole." The
foundation of this movement is. I under
stand, a fear that If any other course la
pursued a contest Is certain to be pre
cipitated and the entire system will bÂ«
overthrown.
Under these circumstances, what differ
ence does it make whether "the push"
holds with the permission of the Civil
Service Commission or without it? The
existent fact Is that they are in posses
sion of the works and cannot be dis
lodged. This is what I said would hap
pen under the charter. If Mr. Clement la
the man I take him to be he will no*
come forward and clear up this civil ser
vice mess. He is. in part, responsible for
It. ' GEORGE D. SQUIRES.

A COMMERCIAL MUSEUM MEETING
HAVING been requested by the Board of Trus
tees of the Mechanics' Institute to do so,
President Wheeler of the State University has
issued a call for a conference upon the question of
establishing in this city a commercial museum similar
in scope to that which has been so successful in
Philadelphia. The meeting is to be held on the even
ing of January 23 at the Hopkins Institute of Art,
?nd will doubtless be well attended.
The Call has repeatedly directed attention to the
vast benefits which the Philadelphia Museum has con
ferred upon the merchants and the manufacturers of
the East, and has pointed out that the success at
tained there is a valid guarantee that results equally
beneficial would accrue to the Pacific Coast from the
establishment of such a museum on a comprehensive
scale in San Francisco. The enterprise which the
conference will consider is therefore not to be re
garded in any way as a speculation or an untried ven
ture. We have simply to follow in the footsteps of
the nien-who built up the museum in Philadelphia
to achieve in proportion to our opportunities and our
energies an equally great success.
That the time is propitious to such an undertaking
is well known to all intelligent observers of the condi
tions of our industry and commerce. The expanding
trade of the United States is turning westward, and
with each succeeding year an increasing proportion
of it is going not across the Atlantic to Europe, but
across the, Pacific to China. It becomes not only
the privilege but the duty of the merchants of San
Francisco to advance and promote that westward
flow of trade. There should be provided here a
museum which will exhibit the articles which, are in
demand in various countries, so that American manu-

THE RESCRIPT OF THE CZAR.
ACCORDING to the London Chronicle the
Czar prepared by way of a greeting to the
world on the Russian New Year's day a re
script of an extraordinary nature. The Czar, like the
Pope and the Kaiser, holds that we have now ente-ed
upon the twentieth century, and his address was de
signed as an appeal to the rulers of the nations to
mark the new era by taking steps in the direction of
permanent peace.
It appears the Czar has been not in the least dis
mayed by the seemingly complete failure of the fa
mous conference at The Hague. His new rescript of
peace is said to be even more in its tenor
than the one which brought about that conference.
It even goes so far as to make a direct appeal to the
parliaments of the nations and to declare: "Mon
strous sums are spent on floating fortresses, which
improved methods of ship-building soon render ob
solete. Let the parliaments which are about to de
liberate on naval armaments consider if there be not
a better way to safeguard a country." The rescript is
further quoted as declaring the Transvaal war to be
an evil which is mitigated only by the fact that it is
"for the present prevented from spreading by the
peaceable disposition of disinterested states."
In the absence of any wide announcement of such
a rescript it is evident that either the Chronicle was
misinformed or else that the Czar sent it out through
secret channels of diplomacy to the officials of the
various nations as a confidential message. The
Chronicle is' not addicted to faking news, and there
fore considerable credit attaches to its report, but it
must be admitted that such a document would be cal
culated to stir up strife rather than diminish it.
Consider the situation. Last year the Russian Gov
ernment appropriated a large sum of money for naval
purposes, but during that year the Kaiser was less
fortunate. The Reichstag rejected the -naval bills.
Now the Czar, having provided for the Russian navy
in the nineteenth century, wishes a general agreement
that there shall be no such appropriations in the twen
tieth century. The emotions of the Kaiser* on receiv
ing such a New Year's greeting from his imperial
brother can be imagined. .
It is to be hoped the full text of the document will
soon be made public. The Kaiser gave the world a
good deal of entertainment by his war talk in cele
bration of the dawn of the new century, and it is only
right the Czar should put the cap on the climax by
a rescript of peace that will make the war iord feel
like a back number, a survival of the middle, ages, a
creature out of date in the twentieth century.
Since the Mayor has so vehemently invited people
to come down from high places it might sug
gest itself to him that the time is opportune for him
to come off his perch.
A BRILLIANT ORATION.
SENATOR BEVERIDGE'S speech on the Phil
ippines was described in the dispatches from
Washington as a "brilliant oration." The Con
gressional Record containing it has now been re
ceived, and the accuracy of the description is made
evident. The speech is indeed one of the most
scintillating that illumines any page of the Record
since its publication began, and to the coruscations
of glittering generalities adds the flashing of dazzling
details.
"I have a nugget of pure gold," said the Senator,
"picked up in its present form on the banks of a
Philippine creek. I have gold dust washed out by the
crude processes of careless natives from the sands of
a Philippine stream. Both indicate great deposits at
the source from which they come." That is a sample
of the Senator's argument. To him a nugget is proof
positive of immense riches, and some gold dust from
the sands of a stream confirmation sure that there are
millions in it. Had the Senator found on his travels
one bone of the vertebra of a megalosaurian he
would have returned to swear the woods are full of
them.
His argument concerning the commercial probabili
ties of the islands is a shining specimen of his style.
It runs thus: "Spain's export and import trade with
the islands, undeveloped, was ?u,534,73i annually.
Our trade with the islands developed will be $125,000.
000 annually, for who believes that we cannot do ten
times as well as Spain?" Who, indeed? Some of us
believe that we can do a hundred times better than
Spain, and on that basis might estimate a Philippine
trade ten times bipger than the Senator estimates.
Such commercial calculations are dead easy; all you
have to dÂ«i is to take a grain of gold dust and
prophesy a poM mine.
Another gem of brilliant ray occurs in the Sena
tor's prediction of the future of the islands and of
Manila. 'â¢Consider," he says, "their imperial dimen
sions. Luzon is larger and richer than New York,
Pennsylvania, Illinois or Ohio. Mindanao is larger
and richer than all New England, exclusive of Maine.
Manila as a port of call and exchange will in the time
of men now living far surpass Liverpool." That
jirophecy sparkles like an aurora borealis, and yet, as
human life goes, most men would consider it a prom
ise of a very desirable longevity if they were assured
of living until Manila surpasses Liverpool.
Even of good things there can be a surfeit, and
therefore :t will not be advisable to reproduce' her
a!l of the Senator's arguments of excelling bright
ness. One more, however, may be admitted. By
way of confirming his glowing hopes of our impe
rialism in the Philippines he tells what has been done
by the British, and fays: "On the bare and burning
rock of Hongkong our constructing race has builded
one of the noblest cities of all the world, and made
the harbor it commands the focus of the commerce
of the East. And the glory of that achievement

of gold dust may be undoubted evidence of exhaust-
Jefs gold mines. Manila may. in our time surpass

As The Call believes them to be men who value
their good names as something better than the price
of a political trickster's bargain, it will leave the
answer to them. They have not sought for a man
who would worthily be their representative. They
have stopped where their official creator commanded
them to stop. They have begun and ended then
search with a young man who in private or official
life is not above reproach, who has stained his name
with actions and associations which do him no credit,
who possesses not a single qualification of mind or
morals to entitle him to the position which in pre
posterous presumption he seeks.
If it were not for the secret manipulations of politi
cians whose greed of ambition blinds them to an
honorable public policy, the name of this young as
pirant would never seriously be considered in con
nection with the office of Chief of Police. The in
vestigation which is now in progress should not be to
determine whether or not he is entitled to the honor
of Chief of Police, but whether public policy can be
subserved by permitting him to remain where he is in
a position to which he has brought no dignity, no
ability and no qualification or merit.
Would William" Thomas, if he were seeking a con
fidential associate, consider the application of a man
whose character had to be a subject for investigation
before his employment? Would George A. Newhall
place the responsible interests of his railroad in the
keeping of a man whose skirts are stained by the
suspicion of scores of witnesses and whose reputation
must be bolstered up by the testimony of people
called from many parts of the State? Would Wil
liam J. Biggy intrust his private character to a man
who must prove that he has one before he can plead
the right of assuming a trust? Would Dr. W. F.
McNutt take into his confidence a man at whom the
menacing finger of scandal is pointing?
It is absurd to believe that the Police Commission
ers would for a moment consider the claims of such
a man in connection with their own personal affairs.
Yet they are the custodians of interests vastly more
important than their own. Can they for a moment
fail to see the clear, straight course of their duty to
the people of this city?

AN APPEAL FROM THE YAQUIS.
OWING to the prevailing interest in the fight in
South Africa and the footrace in the Philip
pines the world has given but little attention
of late to the struggle of the Yaquis for freedom and
sovereignty in Sonora. By way of rectifying that in
justice there has been issued a manifesto to the
American people from the Yaqui junta setting forth
reasons why they have taken up arms and giving a
cordial invitation to any and all volunteers who may
choose to go to their aid in the fight. " '
The manifesto declares that the Yaquis have begun
their struggle against Mexico primarily because "it
is not natural a superior race submit to an
inferior." It goes on to add, however, that the war
was precipitated largely by the friendliness of the
Yaquis for the Americans, and in proof thereof says:
"In May, IS9B, when the Americans were fighting the
Spaniards, the Yaqui nation offered for the service
of the United States 2500 soldiers, fresh from the
battle-field, sweet with liberty. The Mexican Govern
ment in its hatred for the United States prevented the
Yaqui soldiers from helping the United States, and
ever since has heaped injury and indignity upon the
Yaquis."
By reason of the wrong of Mexico in not permit
ting the braves sweet with liberty to serve under our
flag in the war against Spain the heroes have re
solved to be free. The proclamation says: "The
Yaqui nation will no longer tolerate the Mexican
army in Sonora. That army is composed of crimi
nals. Mexico, instead of improving her convicts,
places them in the army that is meant to hold the
Yaquis in subjection. Thus' it is that Sonora is the
dumping-ground for the criminals of Mexico. The
Yaquis will not have dishonest men among them,
whether Mexican convict or official."
For the information of all who feel desirous to aid
the good work the information is given in the mani
festo that the Yaqui nation has established a provi
sional government, . the offices of which are at
Babispe. The Yaqui army headquarters are at Opo
sura in winter, and Potam in summer. All Americans
are welcome to enlist. In the event o\ the success of
the Yaqui people over the robber Mexicans no for
eigners, except native-born Americans, will be al
lowed in Sonora for ten years. The property and
persons of Americans in Sonora will be protected by
the Yaquis in every way. All Americans are warned
against Mexicans who commit murders ascribed to
Yaquis.
The manifesto is signed by seven names, and they
are suggestive of a wide variety of nationalities.
Among them are Spanish names like Saavedra, Es
calante, Tenebanto and Villa, but there is also, a
Duryea, a Herbst and a Dwyer. Altogether it is a
bright document and well signed, but what may bz
the object of it is something which must be left to
speculation and guessing matches.
The Board of Public Works has begun its admin
istration with the very commendable purpose of
keeping the City Hall clean. It certainly would not
be unwise to commence the cleansing process in the
Mayor's office.
THE ENIGMA OF THE POLICE COM
MISSION.
XHE Police Commissioners of this city are oc
cupying to-day a position which it is extremely
difficult to understand. They have been chosen
to posts of duty which, in their importance, have no
I parallel in our local government. The Commissionr
j ers have been selected to be the guardians of our
j moral health. It is they who are to protect us from
j the criminal and debasing elements which enter in
j evitably into metropolitan life. They are commis
| sioned, within their legitimate powers, to organize a
; Police' Department that shall be aggressive, vigorous,
j efficient in its control of the forces that militate
I against municipal purity.
In that organization the Police Commissioners find
themselves called upon to appoint a Chief of Police,
in whose hands must be placed the vital duty of
operating the great forces of the department. The
Commissioners know that the Chief of Police must be
a man of experience, education, resources and special
adaptability to the work demanded by police super
vision. That he must be a man of unsullied reputa
tion and unimpeached integrity is his least qualifier
tion, although an absolutely essential one. He must
not only be that, but something more. He must be
able to govern men, possess executive ability of
marked degree, be able to act intelligently and with
dignity as the representative of this city in its com
plicated relations with the other cities of the world.
The Police Commissioners as intelligent men un
derstand all this. As honest men, who wish to ful T
fill their obligations to society and to preserve the
dignity to which they are entitled, they certainly
know that their choice must be a man whose known
integrity, acknowledged ability and special qualifica
tion will inspire the people of the city with confi
dence and respect. And what are the Police Com
missioners doing in their efforts to choose a Chief
of Police? Are they seeking in the roll of honest,
able men, eligible for the high honor and tremendous
responsibility of the position? Are they doing for
the people of San Frarfcisco what they would un
questionably do for themselves if their private, per
sonal interests were at stake? Are they acting hon
estly to themselves or to the people of this city by
faithfully administering the trust which they have ac
cepted?

The .issue has been under consideration for some

WHEELEB LECTURES.
University President Addresses a
Large Gathering in Temple
Emanu-El.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler lec
tured last night before a large and fash
ionable gathering in Temple Emanu-El on
Sutter street, the theme of his discourse
being "The Book of Amos." President
Wheeler prefaced his address by the
statement that the great majority of read
ers of the present time, especially read
ers of religious literature, misinterpreted
what they read. This was because they
read without at the same time making
a study of the history of the periods
treated by the writers.
The book of Amos, he said, contained
many passages of rare beauty and was
acknowledged by scholars to be a voluma
of excellent literary finish. Amos, he said,
preached at the time when GreecÂ« wajÂ»
dotting the shores of the Mediterranean
with her colonies and long before tha
foundation of Constantinople. He was a
poor herdman and made no pretense of
being a prophet, believing simply that he
had been commissioned by God to deliver
a message to the people. Israel at that
time was at the height of Its prosperity
and the nobles dwelt in luxury and ease,
yet Amos appeared before them and fear
lessly preached the doctrine of equality of
man. In which he thoroughly believed. Hu
was the first of the preachers to como
from the people, coming a generation be
fore Hosea. Isaiah and Mlcah. and re
garded by many as the most eloquent and
forceful of them all.

CHAMPIONS FROM
ST, LOUIS WERE
POSSIBLY ANGRY
Did Not Visit Chico
Convention.
ROOMS ENGAGED FOR FOUR
NO ONE APPEARED TO OCCUPY
THE QUAR.TERS.
In the Party Were Van Landingham,
Commissioner of the St. Louis
Traffic Bureau, and Other
Men of Prominence.
?
When the representatives of the Paclric
Coast Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation went to Chlco to explain to the
members of the Pacific Retail Hardware
Dealers' Association the merits of the
contention made by the Jobbers and man
ufacturers of the coast in the suit insti
tuted by the Middle West jobbers before
the Interstate Commerce Commission, It
was with the expectation that they would
mppt a St. Louis delegation at Chlco
which was prepared to attempt to per
suade the retailers that the retailers
would find the Middle ' West people better
friends than the jobbers of the coast.
There was no doubt that the St. Ixjuis
delegation of four members Intended to
be at the Chlco conference. Rooms had
been engaged for four at the Chlco Hotel
by Mr. Flynn, a commercial traveler rep
resenting the Simmons Hardware Com
pany of St. Louis. The Middle West
party consisted of men very prominent
in business and traffic affairs, and tne
idea was to make a strong showing for
the Middle West. To the surprise of the
California representatives of the coast
jobbers and manufacturers, the St. Louis
people did not appear. There was no In
terruption to the proceedings on that ac
count. On Thursday afternoon the entire
matter of the differentials and the exist
ing rate situation was discussed. The re
sult was the unanimous adoption of reso
lutions in favor of upholding the Jobbers
and manufacturers of the coast in the at
titude they have taken in regard to differ
entials.
Where the "St. Louis delegation was is
still a puzzle. The party consisted of A.
J. Van Landingham, the commissioner of
the St. Louis Traffic Bureau; P. N. John
son, traffic manager of the Simmons
Hardware Company, ai\d O. S. Norvell
and Mr. Flynn of the same concern. The
last named stopped at Marysville and the
others are said to have passed through
Chico without stopping and to have gone
on as far as Redding. The reason as
signed for their non-appearance was that
they were not Invited to be "present, al
though they had expected to get an mvi
tation.
The California delegation was ready to
argue the matter with them on all points.
One of the delegation confessed to disap
pointment that they did not come. The
resolutions that were adopted showed
that the retailers understood the situation
perfectly and saw that they had common
interest with the Jobbers and manufac
turers of the coast.
The coast delegation present was
stronger than was reported. President
Waketleld Baker headed the list. The
others were: Traffic Manager Loveland,
W. It. Wheeler. -A-. C. Rulofson. A. L..
Scott. Brace Hayden. LÂ». N. Curtiss, A. A.
Watklns. Mr. Sibley of the John Deere
Implement Company. Mr. Lindsay of the
Oliver Plow Company and Thomas P.
Smith from this city; also from Sacra
mentoâMessrs. Shaw and Batcher, part
ners in the concern of Shaw & Batcher;
T R. Enright of Holbrook, Merrill At
Stetson, Mr. Sage of Baker & Hamilton,
Mr. Llghtner of Waterhouse & Lester,
Mr. Linn of W. P. Fuller & Co. and Mr.
Martin of Stanton & Co. There were also
present about all the commercial travel
ers representing the houses named who
travel In the Sacramento Valley. The
delegates to the retailers' convention fully
represented the retail hardware trade of
the Interior and also the mountain towns
north of Tehachapl.
President Baker said on his return thit
the attitude of the convention showed
clearly that the contention of the Jobbers
and manufacturers conld not be far
wrong. Mr. Loveland expressed satisfac
tion with the outcome of the delibera
tions. Mr. Wheeler said that the effect
would be good, for the retailers had all
phases of the matter under consideration
presented to them, and so decided with
full understanding. The efforts of the
Middle West Jobbers to incite disagree
ment on the coast had apparently failed.

THE PLACE AND VALUE OF WOMEN'S WORK.

XV. WOMEN WORKERS IN THE t
HOME. I
As a factor In social economy woman s 1
work has long now had definite place and r
value. In_thls enlightened age, and es- c
peclally In this favored land, society has '
reached the point where it willingly ac-
cepts and applauds woman for what, at t
any time, she may show herse-lf capable <
of being and doing that Is noble and com- t
manding. \
Much of the normal work of the home
has been taken out of the home by mod
ern scientific Improvements, so that
women of to-day have less to do in that
realm than in our grandmothers' day.
Moreover, though, naturally.* woman is
the homemaker. the homekeeper, and
man the- home-supporter, the home-pro
tector, often to-day a woman must as
sume part of a man's work of protection.
This is a misfortune, not an opportunity.
An effective avenue for homeworkers
has been opened through the women's
exchanges, which are now found in nearly
all our large cities, and virtually all grow
ing out of philanthropic motives. These
exchanges have already had an appreci
able effect on economic 'conditions, and
must in the future play a still more im
portant part. They have a double end in
view, to direct into remunerative chan
nels the work of women suddenly reduced
to penury, with the secondary aim of en
couraging the principle of self-help in the
minds of girls and women who in the
future will be helpful and not helpless
when misfortune comes.
In carrying out its objects the exchange
receives, under specified conditions,
articles of the three general classes of
domestic work, needlework and art work.
Under the domestic department are in
cluded all kinds of food prepared at home
by the consignors and sold through the
exchangeâ articles of many varieties,
every form of bread, pastry, cake, cook
ies, cold meats, salads, soups, desserts,
preserves. Jellies. Jams, pickles, sauces
and delicacies for the sick. In the de
partment of needlework nearly 100 differ
ent articles are enumerated by different
exchanges, and the number is practically |
without limit, since It Includes every form
of plain and fancy sewing. The art de
partment is for the specific encourage
ment of decorative art, and Its possibill- 1
ties as well as actual achievements are j
great. These three departments are found
In all the exchanges, but each adds its
own especial line of work, according to the
locality and the consequent needs of the
community. A few receive scientific end
literary work, others arrange for cleaning
and mending lace, recovering furniture,
writing and copying, the preparation of |
lunches for travelers and picnic parties. |
while a few take orders for shopping. The |
exchanges have pointed out to women a
means of support that can be carried on
within their own homes, and which at the
same time is perfectly compatible with
other work necessarily performed there.
These women are learning that society is
coming more to respect the woman who
supports herself by making good bread,
cakes and preserves than the woman who
teaches school indifferently, gives poor
elocutionary performances or becomes a
mere mechanical contrivance In a shop or
factory. They are finding that the stamp
of approval is ultimately set on the way
work is done rather than on the occupa
tion itself. Thus it is that hundreds of
women from Maine to Texas and Califor
nia are obtaining for themselves and oth
ers partial or entire support.
Not only are such articlesâ as bread,
preserved fruit, salads, desserts and an In
numerable number of special domestic
compounds. In addition to the products of
the needle and decorative art workâ found
In the large cities, but in country villages
many women are engaged In such work
and often find a ready sale In the home
market. In one village of only 500 inhabi
tants one young woman makes and sells
daily thirty loaves of bread. One woman
in another country town earns a good liv
ing by sending chicken salad to be sold In
New York City. Another has cleared $400
each season by making preserves and Jel
lies on private orders. A fourth has built
up a large business, employing four or
five assistants. In making cake. These in
stances, which might be multiplied, are
taken from the class of domestic work
alone. As many more might be cited from
the departments of needlework and deco
rative art work. Surely It Is better for the
Individual and better for society that
women should turn to useful account
their various talents rather than attempt
to enter the overcrowded occupations and
do work for which they have neither tal
ent nor inclination.
No discussion of women borne-workers
Is complete without an inclusion of the
household servant question. Seventy-five
years ago a woman who was obliged to
earn her own living went naturally into
domestic service, hardly asking herself
whether there was any other avallabln
employment. The same woman to-day
might choose from a hundred vocations.
Domestic service pays better than most
other employments In which women are
engaged, yet wherever the workshop
comes Into competition with domestic ser
vice the kitchen is deserted. What supe
rior attractions has the workshop to of
fer? First, regular hours. However weari
some the day. the factory employee looks
forward to an pvpning all her own. Tho
law prohibits Sunday labor in factory and
workshop, but this law does not reach the
kitchen. A second potent attraction to the
workshop is companionship. Woman morÂ«
than man Is a social being. The factory
operative or shopgirl, moreover, lives at
home or among her friends. The house
servant may be better housed and better
fed but she Is not free. Here lies the se
cret of the universal prejudice against
domestic service. In the competition be
tween workshop and kitchen the work
shop will surely triumph un.ess the house
keeper can offer girls tbe same or equiv
alent inducements.
There Is a graver side to the study of
women workers In the home than has
yet been touched upon. An English wrl-
:er calls the home workers "the worst
jaid of our women." That is In some re
spects true of our women. What iÂ»
tnown as the "sweating system" is maln
y carried on in the so-called unprotect
'd tradesâ that is. trades wherein no law
â¢nforcÂ»js proper sanitary arrangements or
limits the hours .of labor. Under thii
"leading come drt-ssmakir.g and tailoring,
york on musiln underwear, upholstering,
jmbrella making, fur .sewing and many
nher isolated industries. 'Inese trades!
Â»re carried on either entirely at home or
partly at home and partly In small fac
tories. The more the horrors of tha
sweating system are ventilated the mora
jrgent seems some remedy. The charges
usually made against those who labor
under the sweating system are lack of
cleanliness in house and person. Intem
perance, thrlftlpssness and immorality.
It would be very strange If thesÂ«j charges
were not true In the main. Some prac
tical remedy Is needed, and until tha
physical cravings of these half-starved,
people are satisfied there can be no real
hope of effecting any vital Improvement
In their morals. What these workers
need Is better food and plenty of it, regu
lar wages, shorter hours of labor, mora
amusements and recreationsâ in short,
more humane treatment.
Wherever the rewards of Industry are
greatest competition is fiercest. In larga
cities no woman's place or stipend is safa
ar fixed, each individual being "but an
other atom flattened by livelier proto
plasm." New York City is such a center.
In the vicinities of Pennsylvania and
Ohio wages for work on clothing and un
derwear come perilously near starvation,
point. In Quaker villages and Bohemian
and Polish colonies partly maintained
homeworkers make a dozen garments for
the price due needy seamstresses for one.
Men's shirts at 4 r J and 37 cents a dozen,
men's drawers at 27 cents a dozen,
thread, machine rent and expressage de
ducted, these rates ofttimes become tha
highest wages that can be obtained by
self-supporting labor excluded from fac
tories because of invalid or infant de
pendÂ£Â«rts. At the South, new occupa
tions, any occupations. Indeed, for wo
men are a boon. Nowhere else in the
world do so many well-bred women,
bankrupt and bereft of male providers,
labor at manual callings as at the South,
pursuing without loss of caste vocation*
which elsewhere involve social ostracism.
The home labor supply being unlimited,
cotton, coal and iron being cheap, and the
cost of living being lessened by a mild
climate, industries grow apace. In Chi
cago and the Northwest natives with
difficulty hold the best places against tha
higher class Immigrants who are tha
backbone of the Northwest's wonderful
development. While wages are better
than In the East, living is dearer. Num
bers of virtuous bread-winners, however,
contribute regularly to the family sup
port, work under just and liberal employ
ment, while living in good homes. But
the same class that suffers In the East
suffers more in the Western cities from
the sharper, unworn wheels of the new
industrial Juggernaut. Chicago has mu
nicipal regulations enforced by Inspectors,
of both sexes. Yet here, as in New York,
are to be found conditions characteristic
of life in all large citiesâ tenement and,
sweatshop abominations, high rent 3 and
importunate rivalry-
Still another side of our subject must bÂ«s
touched upon â namely, that of the pin
money workers. Everywhere manufactur
ers and merchants advertise for woion
workers who "live at home, to learn tha
business"â a device, as students of econ
omics claim, to fill the firm's coffers by
inveigling artisans and small shopkeep
ers Into giving their daughters board that
the daughters may engage for wages
which will barely clothe, them. An Inves
tigation made in Massachusetts recentl/
of seamstresses working in their own
homes on cotton underwear shows that,
under the present State law requiring a
license for such workers, which is given
only to those whose homes are clean, tha
amount of work so distributed has been
greatly reduced. The wages, however, re
main pitifully small, and the pin-mon Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢y
worker aids in lowering wages by her
willingness to accept a pittance. Many
cases are found where women working at
home are paying the rent as their sharo
of work. As a general rule it is very tiii
ficult for a woman to support herself en
tirely by home work.
It Is a wide subjectâ that of women
workers in the home. Like many another
problem confronting us in the closing
days of this century, the surest means tÂ»
the best ends have not yet been reach<=-<!.
Here, there and everywhere wonnn
obliged to work at homp because of in
valid or children dependents are seeking
and not finding sufficient employment.
Women's exchanges are giving substan
tial aid; labor unions, college settlements
and consumers' leagues are studying t.->
meet the needs of workers; both men and
women training schools for servants arÂ«
bringing household service into better re
pute; Legislatures are Investigating tha
evils of the sweating system and the mis
eries of the "submerged tenth." But
much remains* to be done. Trade and
housekeeping schools should be estab
lished to make dependent women self-sup
porting, while, a step further back, man
ual training should be introduced In pub
lic schools to develop faculty and create
power. Domfstic service should be dig
nified and made more attractive by abro
gating the false distinction between sales
women and cooks or maids by raismrr
cooking and housrhoM work Into a tra<le
or profession. Again the wnmrn of leisuf*
should Intprest themselves to know tho
real condition of the tollers of their sex,
and should use their social position to
Influence public sentiment In behalf of re
forms or to shape remedial legislation. It
Is through such measures, by such Influ
ence, that
"Slow and sure comes up the golden
year."

"COMMIS VOYAGEURS" TO
MASQUERADE TO-NIGHT
The committee having In charge the
masquerade ball to be given this evening
In Mechanics' Pavilion by the "Commls
Voyageurs" reported last night that
everything was In readiness for the big
event. An excellent band has been en
gaged to discourse music throughout the
evening and early hours; the floor of the
Immense structure has been properly
waxed for dancing; every decorajtlon is In
Its place and every attendant has been in
structed as to his or her duties.
A feature of the ball will be the ballet.
One hundred shapely young women nave
been engaged for this Important feature
and the entire corps has been drilled by a
master. The commercial travelers will
be out In force and style. Nearly 100,
dressed in evening attire, will act as a re
ception committee. Judging by the num
ber of $5 tickets disposed of there is every
likelihood of a large attendance. The
floor committee has been Instructed not to
allow any one on the floor who is not
properly costumed. Handsome prizes have
been offered for beautiful and original
costumes.
Civil Service and Women.
The Civil Service Commission yesterday
received tho advance copies of the little
pamphlet containing a synopsis of the
charter provisions governing the appoint
ment, promotion and removalln the pub
lic service of this city and county. Ten
thousand copies" of the pamphlet have
been ordered and will soon be ready for
distribution. An important provision in
regard to sex reads as follows:
"Sex shall be disregarded except when
some statute, the rules of the Commis
sioners or the appointing power specifies
sex."
This provision Is of Interest to a number
of women who have signified their lnten-.
tlon of taking the examinations.
FORESTS MUST BE SAVED.
President Jordan Lectures Before the
Camera Club.
Before an audience that packed every
Inch of floor and gallery last night in
Metropolitan Temple, Professor D. S.
Jordan made an impassioned and practi
cal plea for the preservation of the for
psts of the Sierras. The lecture, under
the auspices of the California Camera
Club, was largely a comparison between
the Alps of' Switzerland and the Cali
fornia Sierras, and during his remarks
the speaker said:
"It Is more the duty of the State to
preserve her forests than to foster com
merce. The forests, once gone, can never
be replaced; commerce wilt come natur
ally. It should be the duty of the State
to hold forever the Great Basin forest
and the Calaveras Grove, which are per
haps the two noblest forests in the
world."
During an Intermission Professor Jor
dan was Informed that a lumber firm
had Just concluded the purchase of the
Calaveras Grove giants and he an
nounced it aa the worst piece of news
he had heard in years.

GIRLS DANCED
Members of the Delta lota Chi Have
a Delightful Time at the
Palace.
Pretty young girls attired In handsome
gowns and stalwart young college men
tripped the light fantastic in the maple
room of the Palace Hotel last evening.
The function was the annual cotillon of
the Delta lota Chi, a well-known frater
nity, composed of young ladies who grad
uated and are now attending the local
high school. Invitations were Issued to
250 society people, and nearly half that
number attended. The ballroom present
ed a brilliant spectacle with its myriad
lights and varl-colored gowns amid the
wide expanse of shirt bosoms and somber
dress suits of the sterner sex. Palms and
cut flowers were used in profusion to artl
charm to the seen*. L<ight refreshments
wore served throughout the evening.
There was not a lull in the dancing and
many pretty figures were gone through.
Many of the fair members of the ex

SALARIES OF FIREMEN
INVOLVED IN DOUBT
MORE EMPLOYED THIS MONTH
THAN CHARTER ALLOWS.
Mayor, Auditor and Fire Commis
sioners Will Hold a Conference
to Settle the Difficulty.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
waited yesterday on Auditor Wells In re
gard to paying the demands of firemen
for the month of January. It appears
that the department Is now employing 160
men more than the charter allows, and
about $1200 in Ealarles is involved in the
matter, the payment of which will be ex
tremely doubtful unless some means can
be found to remedy the difficulty.
Upon Chief Sullivan asking the Auditor
whether the demands of the firemen for
this month would be audited Mr. Wells
replied that only the number provided by
the charter, which is 180 less than the
number heretofore employed, could be
passed. Chief Sullivan stated that it had
been found Impracticable to reduce the
force of firemen at such short notice, as
it would tend to demoralize the organiza
tion and cripple the efficiency of the Eire
Department.
Auditor Wells was convinced of the
force of the Chief's remarks and thought
that the matter might be arranged on the
ground of expediency. He suggested that
a conference be held between the Mayor,
Fire Commissioners and himself and a
satisfactory settlement might be arrived
at. The Auditor stated that if he were
backpd by the Mayor and the commis
sion he would pass the demands of all the
firemen now employed for this month
only.

HEALTH BOARD ACTS.
Overlooks Patronage, and Settles
Down to Business.
The subject of patronage did not enter
Into the deliberations of the Health Board
at its regular meeting .last night, and as
a consequence a number oi citizens who
are anxious to serve the municipality In
Improving its sanitary conditions were
visibly disappointed; Much to the disgust
of the office seekers the board settled
down to the consideration of several mat
ters directly affecting the health Interests
of the city.
A communication was read from the
United States quartermaster's department
regarding the shipment of bodies of dead
soldiers from Manila. A transport which
will arrive on January 25 has on board
350 bodies and some of the soldiers died
from contagious or infectious diseases.
On motion of Dr. McCari-.y the health
officer was authorized to confer with the
chief surgeon of the Department of Cali
fornia for the purpose of taking such
means as win be necessary to avoid any
possible spread of contagion. It was the
sense of the board that unless the bodies
had been buried for at least one year
they would be refused landing. â¢
Dr. I. Katsuki, who is -about to leave
for the Hawaiian Islands, was appointed
special correspondent of the board. The
position Is an honorary one and Dr. Kat
suki will keep the board informed as to
the health conditions of the islands.
On the report of Assistant Sanitary In
spector Fitzgibbon that the building at
122 Grove street was in a frightfully un
sanitary condition and absolutely danger
ous to life the building was ordered con
demned forthwith and will be destroyed
after due notice has been given to the
owners and tenants.
The chief sanitary inspector was in
structed to Investigate the rookeries at
M street and Fourth avenue, which are
occupied by Chinese and are in an un
sanitary condition.
Health Officer O'Brien was directed to
Investigate the report of Charles Alpers
regarding condemned food ordered sent
to the fertilizing works and also his rec
ommendation that a market inspector be
stationed at Second street wharf to in
spect meats as they are brought Into the
city on the railroad.
Martin Regensburger, secretary of the
Training School for Nurses. Informed the
board that the course had been increased
from two to three years in order to in
crease the efficiency of the graduates.
in the downtown section known as "Un
derground District No. 1." as the time
limit for so doing will soon expire. The
board decided to investigate the matter.
The residents of Bush street petitioned
that the cum of $40,000 be expended in re-
S airing that thoroughfare. Commissioner
lanson was delegated to investigate and
report to the board.
The board decided that after February
2 its meetings will be held on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays at 10 a. m.

TINPLATE TRUST LOOMS UP
NORTONS MAKE A DICKER OF

Stout Denials Are Hade in This City,
but There Are Parties in Inter
est Here Who Claim to
Have Information.
< New and even more interesting: rumors
than had previously been given publicity
concerning the fruit canneries of the State
were In circulation yesterday and lent
spice to the situation. In the first place,
it was said that the mysterious party
who was reported in The Call yesterday
morning as interested in the establishment
of a new can manufacturing plant In this
city or vicinity would probably be on the
scene within the next week. He is an
Eastern man and has good business con
nections. The next statement that went
the rounds was somewhat sensational,
but it was credited in various places, not
withstanding some vigorous denials. This
was in substance that three can manufac
turing companies doing business in the
State have given options for sixty days
upon their plants, these being the Pacific
Sheet Metal Works, the Union Can Com
pany and the Great Western Can Com
pany. The first two are in this city and
the other is in San Jose.
The rumor extended to particulars and
Included names. It was alleged by a rep
utable merchant, who is connected with
the canning industry, that the parties
who had taken options on the can making
plants were the Nortons of Chicago, a
very large concern, and that they were
acting in connection with the tin plate
trust and had secured options upon 70
per cent of all the can making plants in
the United States. This story was em
phatically denied at both of the local can
manufactories, but that did not necessari
ly prove that it was untrue entirely, while
there might have been some errors in the
story. â¢ â¢
Another story was that the local can
makers have Dooled their interests and
have combined on prices. This was also
denied and also Insisted upon. The par
ticular fact of interest to the public is
that the price of cans has been advanced
to the extent of about $4 per thousand.
The local can makers say that the reason
is the advance in the price of tin plate.
Some of the canners smiled at this ex
planation and would not accept any view
of the phenomenon except that a com
bination had been effected. The Idea was
also entertained by some canners outside
of the combine that they have been
charged a higher price for cans than the
canning companies in the combination.
All this tends to add interest to the
movemens of the mysterious agent who
may represent outside capitalists who are
eager to invtst money In a new can mak
ing plant. The story current is that this
agent has been delayed in making an
appearance by sickness in his family.
Several concerns are keeping a sharp
lookout for him whenever he may arrive.
The wonderment increases concerning
the cannery that Frank S. Johnson has
purchased and all sorts of conjectures are
based Upon the secrecy that Is maintained
in regard to that matter. All the canners
are interested in the â¢ rumors flying
about and eagerly ask questions concern
ing what is going on, but nearly all say
they are entirely in the darÂ«c concerning
the facts.
If the story about the combination of
the great majority of the can manufactur
ing plants of the country shall prove to
be true the deal will mount high into the
millions of dollars.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19â The dullness and
apathy which have prevailed in the stock mar
ket all week pave place In the late dealings
to-day to a considerable show of animation
and ftrength. Business broadened out and em
braceu a greatly extended list of stock and
practically all that were dealt in advanced
briskly to a level substantially above that of
last night. The immediate motive of the buy
ing movement was the preliminary estimates
of the gains in cash by the associated banks
during the week, which has shown with suf
ficient clearness that cash reserves were being
largely replenished, but It is rather a tradi- i
tien with slock operators to defer action to 1
discount the bank BtateniOnt until Friday
alternoon. Thf*re has been a large waiting I
contingent in Wall street watching for some i
positive development in the market before com- j
mining themselves to action. All the larger I
comuiissicin houses have been advising their i
customers to refrain from action and await
the irarket. Apparently a larce proportion of
thest were iniiirws:>ed by the earlier events of
the day in the market and came in with buy
in* orders in force In the last hour. The pro- j
:â¢Â¦>:Â¦: Â¦:.;Â». traders themselves turned In a body j
to the long side of the market after having |
made a bavape dilve in the morning at Third
Avenue, breaking that stf>ck over 10 points.
The an.r-unt of Mocks brought out on the de
cline did DOt prove encouraging and the rest
of the market was not aoutely affected. A
number of positive points of Etrength also de
veloped, notably in Missouri Pacific, in which
there was evidence of o;<erations by a pool.
The whole of the south w* stern group was
affected by rympatny. notwithstanding the de
teriorations in earnings on account of a small
ootton movement- The metfU group was also
strong, led by Steel and Wire, which was
bought in anticipation of dividend action,
fcupar was a prominent figure in the advance
on heavy deulincs, in which the demand from
the shorts was a larpe factor. These special
points of Etrenpth were the vantage points I
lrom which the late general advance in prices
was inaugurated. There were rumors ail day
of the relief of Lad>>mith. but as London sold
wore stocks than she bought in this market the
rumors were wlthi.ut much effect. It is esti
mated that the associated bunks had gained
up to Thursday night nearly $10,000,000 In cash
the estimate being based on figures furnished
by the principal banks of the express move
ment. Of this total operations with the sub
treasury have furnished $4.196.0fÂ»0. There has
been no evidence of any large loan expansion
in the stock market, but the time money mar
ket and that for mercantile paper has been
qutte active. A notable increase In surplus
reserve is. however, oonsldered assured.
The market for railroad bonds continued
broad and active all day and strength was
general throughout the list. Total i-ul-ss, car

NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Money has be
come decidedly easier this week. Call loan
rates are now back to a lower average than
at any time since the early autumn. Sup
plies of funds available for the purposes of
Wall street are Increasing and lenders not only
show a renewed disposition to put out their
money on time at about Â£@5% per cent, but
are also much less critical as to the char
acter and quality of the collateral offered.
The general easing off of rates for money iii
the London and continental markets has also
relieved the situation here by removing the
matter of immediate gold exports. In short
the conditions which were mainly responsible
for the disorganization of the speculative mar
kets in December have undergone a decided
change for the better. Nevertheless the ability
to carry stocks once more on comparatively
easy terms has not had its expected â¢ effect In
reviving speculative interest and activity
Transactiona have dwindled and on several
days this week the dealings were so limited
and the tone of the market so utterly per
functory as to suggest a comparison with the
dullness of midsummer. The public is evi
dently doing little or nothing and commission
houses report a dearth of orders except â¢ j far
as Investors are once more coming into the
market and picking up bonds or dividend-pay
ing railroad stocks and preferred Industrials
This latter movement has naturally assumed
some dimensions as rates for money have de
clined, though there Is no very Intense de
mand from the above source. The profes
sionals in the absence of the public have
found little opportunity to Indulge In any seri
ous manipulative demonstrations, and there
fore activity has been limited to a few stocks
in which the boardroom traders have pro
duced generally extremely moderate fluctua
tions. Speculation, in short, seems to be wait
ing and the general feellnc Is that the factor
in which its course depends Is the outcome of
the military operations In South Africa, or
rather the way in which the London market
will be affected by the next Important develop
ments from that quarter. This is, to all ap
pearances, demonstrated by the degree of
strength which prices here developed on the
news that the British forces had taken a more
advantageous strategic position, although the
slight Improvement which followed in the Lon
don market did not develop any particular for
eign buying of our stocks. It seems, however
that the street and the public have come to
the conclusion that should the Boers inflict
any further serious defeat on the British army
It would be followed by a severe disturbance
In values at London and on the continent
while developments calculated to encourage a
belief in the early termination of the South
African struggle might cause an advance or
at any rate afford a basis on which large in
terests would feel it was safe to work actively
for higher prices.
NEW YORK. Jan. 19.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Whether the new year will surpass or keep
pace with the old is the question which elves
special Interest to every week's returns. Com
paring now with business by far the largest
and most prosperous ever known a year
ago, more than 40 per cent larger than In
January, 1898. i which in its turn had shown
heavier business than in any year preceding,
it cannot be expected that such a gain will
be repeated. But the decrease of 9.6 per cent
in payments through the Clearing-house Is
wholly due to great speculative activity at New
York last year, with sales of 12.031.532 shares,
against 6.515.920 to the same date this year, for
payments outside this city have been 4.3 per
cent greater than a year ago and greater than
in the same part of any other month.
This week one contract of 10.CWO tons for a
Western road and two for bridges requiring
ll.OuO tons are the only big transactions re
ported in Iron products, but heavy business
was secured by concessions, for plates at Pltts
burg colng materially below 2.25, for bars at
Philadelphia below 2.20, the price of the aeso
clatlon. Sheets are also lower at the East,
but $1 higher at Pittsburg. Sales of foundry
pig at reduced prices include two for 10,0<jO tons
and No. 1 Lehich Is quoted at $24, but Besse
mer and gray forte at Plttsburg are held un
changed, though without sales.
The copper output of this country In 1599
was 262.2i.tf tons, greater by 91.000. or 53% per
cent, than in 1X95. while the foreign product
last year, 89,240 tons, gained in the four years
only 3002 tons.
The prices of copper and lead are unchanged,
with tin higher at 27% c. Perhaps the most im
portant Industrial event is the marketlnir of
woolen goods at prices averaging 15.4 per cent
higher than last year, many makes having been
promptly sold up and withdrawn, while others
sell so well as to give great encouragement.
As wool quotations average 34.9 per cent higher
than a year ago the rise In goods Is not ex
cessive. But hopes of wool speculators for a
further rise were dashed by the fall of 6 per
cent In merinos at the London sale, with cross
breds weaker, and considerable sales at conces
sions of l%c to 3c followed here, one of 300.000 '
pounds of Montana at 20c, with numerous or
ders to sell consignments hitherto held oft the
market. Sales In three weeks. 14, 920,800 pound 3,
have been smaller than In the corresponding
weeks of the three previous years.
Business In cotton goods begins to Increase,
though in staples it Is still moderate. The
goods now average 29.7 per cent higher than a
year a*ro and with the rise this week to 7.81 c
cotton is 1.1 per cent higher. Belief In a short
crop has helped the goods market and still
sustains It, though cotton Is a little lower than
it was two months ago. Receipts from planta
tions continued over a third smaller than last
year but exports decreased quite as much.
Shipments of shoes from the East In expecta
tion of old orders continue larger than In any
previous year, 250.25S cases In three weeks, over
20 per cent larger than last year and 3.8 per
cent larser than In IS9S. But business does
not amount to a quarter of the current pro
duction, it Is said, and in every line doubt
about maintenance of prices hinders buying.
The market for breadstuffs Is not active nor
have changes in. prices of elevator wheat been
of any consequence, but the active May option
thows a sharp decline. Atlantic exports con
tinue far below former years. In three weeks
6.003,325 bushels, against 13,224,082 last year,
and Pacific exports in the same weeks were
2 291.775, against 1.853.934 last year. Western
receipts were In three weeks only 8,632,132,
aealnsl 13.005.452 last year.
Corn receiDts are smaller than last year by
5,000,000 bushels for the three weeks, while ex
ports have been 10,355,185 bushels, against 9,510.
499 last year, and this active movement caused
spot quotations to advance.
Failures for the week have been 242 in the
United States, against 24S last year, and 40 in
Canada, against 22 last year.

the extreme of dullness In some lines, and
especially in those branches of speculation
which go to radically affect financial affairs
and therefore the volume of bank clearings.
Close examination of leading lines of industry
falls to show marked unfavorable features. It
Is true that retail 1 traae. in seasonable goods
has been and is being affected by phenomenally
mild winter weather, but wherever spring
trade, particularly. in- dry goods, has been de
veloped, it has been in such volume and ac
companied with such a readiness of accept
ance of advanced prices as to point to un
dlmlnlshed confidence on the part of the trade
world as to the outlook for spring business.
The iron and steel industry, Justly regarded
as a trustworthy Index of general trade. Is
still actively employed on old orders and new
business Is limited for reasons unnecessary to
recapitulate. It Is evident that the few re
action* In prices shown In such an ordinarily
dull period as this have strengthened rather
than lessened confidence In the future. Signs
of preparations for the coming season's needs
are shown in the reported active inquiry ror
steel rails at the West, recent sales at Chicago
aggregating so.ooo, tons, some of which are
for northwestern railroads and some for ex
port. Production Is as evidently hard pushed
as ever and the question of fuel supplies rather
than new orders engrosses manufacturers at
tention. Some concession in foundry iron is
noted, but aside from this price changes are
within very narrow limits. The other metals
are rather stronger, copper and tin being higher
on the weak, the latter In sympathy with ad
vances abroad. Spring trade In hardware is
opening well and advances in prices are gener
ally reported.
Cereals are dull In nearly all directions and
the pressure of enlarged "stocks, particularly
abroad, has been Influential this week in bring
ing about a reaction In prices. Corn and oats,
however, are rather firmer on foreign buying,
though sympathetically affected by the de
cline In the leading, cereals.
Coffee 1b actn-e, speculation being Influenced
by higher European advances and advices of
a large domestic consumption.
Apparently Improved British prospects In
South Africa are assigned as the reason for
the better buying of cotton, resulting In a
fractional advance this week. The crop move
ment still continues much smaller than ex
pected by the bears. Cotton goods are meeting
with good demand on spring demand. Â¦
Rather more Inquiry Is noted for wool, par
ticularly at Boston and men's wear sales for
next fall are meeting with good patronage,
notwithstanding the advances demanded. Fine
wools are at about the highest point reached
in twenty years.
Lumber is strong, particularly white pine
grades, partly because of smaller stocka and
possibly smaller, cut In the Northwest as a
result of lack of snow and partly because
of a hopeful feeling as to the building outlook
for the coming spring.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3,061,026 bushels, against 4,248,
926 bushels last week. 6,198.671 bushels in the
corresponding week of IS9?, 3,720,064 bushels In
IS9S. 2.916,706 bushels In 1597 and 3.549.271
bushels in 1896.
Since July 1, this season, the exports of
wheat aggregate 113,803.831 bushels, against
139,234.719 bushels last year and 141,668,974
bushels in 1897-98.
Business failures in the United States are
fewer in number, they being 205 for the week,
as compared with 295 last week, 262 In this
week a year ago, 309 In IS9S; 424 in 1897. and
341 in 1896.
Canadian business failures for the week
number 35. as compared with 28 last week. 30

Business here was still very dull to-day.
There whs some slight noisy buying, but even
professional dealings were stopped by the
eagerness for the news from the seat of war.
A larc crop of rumors which were current
were entirely Ignored. Consols spurted half a

will lpsue a large loan as soon as the market

Dun's Review of Trade.
Bank Clearings.
CHICAGO. Jan. 19.â With Liverpool firm and
Northwest receipts moderate, wheat opened
firm, a shade over yesterday. May at 65H@63<$c.
Ihe weakness of corn and oats made Itself
felt shortly afterward, and May sold off to 65Â« i
Â«TC5%c. Additional reports of damage, to the
French crop by frost caused exporters to cover
shorts later, and as a slight Improvemert In
the local and in cash demand met with rather
light offerings, the market reacted, carrying
May to 0514 c. Trade was moderately active,
and the advance was steadily maintained, May
closing 'ac over ye6terdny at G3%c,
Corn was easy. Influenced by the assertion
that the GDvernment report, expected lc be
bullish, would be Issued Saturday, this Â¦ being
in contradiction of a previous report that It
would not be published thia month. May
closed '4c under yesterday at SS'/'aC.
The easiness of corn, combined with the ex
pectation of the Issuance on Saturday of a
Government report discouraging. to holders. In
fluenced a decline In the oats market. One
firm let out 500.C00 bushels, the break thereby
occasioned being helped by floor traders. On
the decline the market steadied and regained
some of the early loss on a good demand from
the East. May closed Vn<3V*e depressed at 23%ic.
The provision market was easy and dull the
greater part of the session. May pork closed
6Q7Hc under yesterday ; May lard unchanged

LONDON. Jan. 18. â The wool auction sales
were continued to-day with a good attendance.
The offerings ' numbered 9615 bales. There was
a better tone to the sales, attributed to a
sharp rise In top grades which were eagerly
sought by the continental buyers. The with
drawal of finest greasles stock, though ex
tensive, was less than yesterday. American
buyers secured a fair proportion of the best
combing greasy after keen competition with
the continent. Crossbred greasy In good con
dition was greatly favored by American buy
ers, who secured good lines of bright medium
and deep brown at easier terms.

POSSIBLE CHANGES
IN NATIONAL GUARD
REAL ESTATE ACTIVE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 19.â Captain Wenk of
F Company, Fifth Infantry, N. G. C,
will probably resign from his position
as commander some lime next month.
He will thon have served ten years, and
will be c-ntitleO to a ten-year service
medal.
There are several candidates in the
field f r the prospective vacancy, among
them being Lieutenant Covalt, Lieuten
ant Bennett and Lieutenant Wethern.
Major Hayes of this city, who was re
cently made lieutenant colonel in the
new volunteers, has created another va
cancy in the staff which must soon be
filled. Among the candidates for the po
sition are Captain Simpson of G Com
pany, Alameda. and Captain Poulter of
A Company in this city.
THERE have been numerous rumors
of big deals In real estate circulat
ing on the street during the past
few days, but while they were jus
tified to a certain extent, none of
them have reached the point where the
deeds were passed. One rumor was to
the effect that a $200,000 sale of property
on Geary street had been consummated
by A. M. Speck & Co., but the report
was premature, a member of that firm
stating yesterday afternoon that the ne
gotiations were still In the air. Another
rumor of the sale of a piece of property
on Geary street, between Taylor and
Jones, to A. Aronson for $35,000 also lacks
eontlrmation. The property on the north
west corner of, Jackson and Octavia
streets is reported to have been sold for
$35,000, but tho names of the parties to the
transaction are not given. All things
considered, the condition of the market is
all that could be desired and brokers gen
erally are In high spirits.
Lyon & Hoag report the following re
cent sales, most of which were made dur
ing the last few days: Lot on the north
side of Page street, 111:3 feet west of Cen
tral avenue, 54x137:6, for $5400, on which
the purchaser will soon 'erect two modern
residences. Lot 25x85, on the south side
of Hermann street, 77:6 feet east of Ste
venson, with three-story building con
taining flats; price $5000. Lot on the

build the delicate gray substance found
in the nerve centers throughout the
body.
It is well to remember that perfect
health cannot be maintained when
even a slight portion of this delicate
substance Is destroyed or lacking In the
body. There is a true and scientific
reason for this statement which can be
easily proven by personal test. Many
people have been convinced of the fact
thnt coffee is a poison to them, but
have been unable to leave it off. Such
persons will find that they can make
Xr,t with all people, but with many,
particularly those that are highly or-
ganizedâ brain workers and their kind
âthe subtle alkaloids contained In or-
tiinary coffee have a direct action upon
the delicate nerves of the stomach, and
by a pathological law the nervous sys-

The result will show. ln a variety of
v.ays, such as headaches in some peo-

others, kidney trouble; in others,

One thinp is absolutely sure and In-

Different people will be affected dif-

ease or symptoms or disease you should
endeavor to locate the source and
cause of that disease. It Is not good
reasoning to apply drugs In an effort to

YOUNG WILLIAM NORRIS
this morning and sustained injuries which
will most likely prove fatal.
The shooting was the, termination of a
moonlight duck huntirtgr trip, on which
young Norris had accompanied his uncle.
Richard Beadell. with whom he resides
at Fifth street and Bancroft way, Berke
ley.
The affair, from best accounts, occurred
on what is known as the Berkeley bulk
head. It appears that Beadell had shot
a duck off the bulkhead and handed his
double-barreled breech-loading gun to his
young nephew, while he himself started
to wade through the water to secure the
game. Young Norrls set the gun down
and rested his right arm over the muz
zle. It Is supposed that hÂ© raised his foot
while watching his uncle, and, in some
manner, brushed against the trigger, dis
charging the loaded barrel.
The full charge of No. 8 shot took effect
In the boy's right arm above the elbow.
The report of" the shotgun and the boy's
agonized screams brought Beadell back
to the bulkhead, but before he could lend
any assistance young Norris had started
running toward his home, about two
blocks distant, at great speed. Exhausted
from pain and loss of blood the Injured
lad fell unconscious at the threshold.
Drs. Payne and Meyers were promptly
summoned, the wound was temporarily
dressed, and shortly before 2 o"clock this
morning the boy was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital by his grandmother, Mrs.
Sarah Beadell, and an aunt.
Dra, Porter and Rowe, the hospital
physicians, found that the tissues of the
arm above the elbow were lacerated, all
of the smaller and one of the largo
arteries were severed and the. bone was
exposed about three Inches. The doctors
said the arm would have to be amputated
and they entertained very slight hopes
of the boy being strong enough to under
go the operation successfully. His condi
tion to-day Is very weak and his temper
ature exceedingly high, while the danger
of blood poisoning 13 also Imminent.
The Injured boy's mother died four
years ago. Ilia father, however. Is liv

a handsome legacy. It was to protect his

pleasing event of Its kind since the famous
Dickens and Shakespeare carnivals of
years ago.

have agreed to assist in arranging the
scenes so as to have them conform with
the times which they will represent. In
addition to the tableaus there will prob
ably be a number of dances typical of the
terpsichorean customs of different periods
of ancient times.
"The affair will be unique and Instruc
tive," said Mrs. G. W. Bunnell, president
of the Women's Alliance and. also of the
Oakland Club, "and we all feel confident
that it will be a thorough success In every
way. There will be fully 500 people tak
ing part, and the entertainment will be a
most pleasing one. While the alliance has
charge of the affair it will be assisted by
a great many other prominent ladles, and
the participants will come generally from
the members of Oakland society."

ORGANIZING TO
HELP OAKLAND'S
BIG BOND ISSUE
Citizens Take the Mat
ter in Hand.
Oakland Offloe s^&n Franclpco Call,
!WS Broadway. Jan. 19.
The preliminary steps have been tak^ti j
t.->w;ird a pcncral organization of the cit
izt*r.< of Oakland to advance the interests j
<?T ;h<i propos'-d bond Issue. The tirst i
Eteps wore taken by some of the most I
prominent a*",d wealthy gentlemen in Oak- >
3:ind ar.d had their origin In the very sec
tion that has been said to be opposed to j
taxes â the aristocratic Fifth Ward.
The meeting was hc'.d at the residence j
< f Captain Edwin Goodall on Jackson |
Ftreot. It had been called with the enm
ri'in consent of many of the leading men
ll y .\ the city and invitations were sent to
the following, most' of whom were pres
ent:
John A. Britton. \V. H. Chlckr-ring. j
."John L,. Howard. 11. F. Gordon, F. M. '

wards. Dr. N. K. Foster. S. P. Hall, j
James Moffitt, W. Frank Pierce and A. |

-The meeting was very representative of '
the best interests of Oakland. There were j
p^ntlemen from all sections, even from !
the newly annexed district. There were
mm in political life, lawyers, business
mm and all with large interests In Oak-
Tlio first proposition made was to organ- I
ieÂ»- in the interests of a bond issue for !
public improvements. This was don<Â» by !
â¢ 'â¢ "T!>-.c Senator Frederick S. Stratton as !
rhalrman and H. F. Gordon as secretary, j
I'ut with the understanding that this was i
only .â¢< temporary organization until a j
larger number could br> Interested in the |
movrmpnt. A committee was then ap- '
j'-ir.trd consisting of F. P. Stratton. John '
A. Britton. H. F. Gordon and \V. V. Wit- i
oher to prepare a lift of one hundred j
j;ames of those that will be Invited to I
Tj'.ke part In a public merting to be ho!d t
Mmrtly. when a complete organization will j
be made.
â¢ Th*> evening was spent in an informal
discussion of thf general bond question,
â¢which developed one factâ that every man
In the ror.m was In favor of bonds, though
Ibejr might differ upon the relative im- I
portnnce of the different projects.
The gentleman agreed that a thorough
ly representative organization of citizen*
should be hud and that this should on- '
c>avor to assist the Council in formulat- !
irq a satisfactory bond proposition, and j
that wh.n such a proposition was agreed j
Cpoo thÂ»=y should become a campaign com- j
mittfÂ«- in favor of the proposition before i
trif> prop!^.
This is by far tlif most important move I
that has been made since Mayor Snow I
tirst advoratt-d the bonding proposition. It '
rtioans that a strong organization will I
lake hold of the plan to improve Oakland !
.â¢Â¦r:d that it will sp^nd time and money to i
do somtthing for the city.

BACK UP ESOLA
Commissioners Re
sume Investigation.
>
M'NAB GUILTY OF CONTEMPT
REFUSED TO TELL OF PRE-ELEC
TION COMPACTS.
Lees Testified That the Lieutenant
Was a Disgruntled Officer, In
capable of Properly Hand
ling the Department.
?
Fred L. Ksola, who. desires to be Chief
of Police of this city, learned a great deal
about himself last night during the inves
tigation of the charges filed against him
with the Commissioners. The second day's
session of the sensational hearing lasted
until midnight, with but half the story
told.
The proceedings were punctuated with
many exciting incidents. Gavin McXab
was called upon to testify to the fa
mous meetings held between A. M.
Lawrence, Mayor Phelan. F. L. Esola
and himself, where it is alleged the
bargain was made to elevate Esola
to the position of Chief. He declined to
answer the lawyer's question, denying
the right of Jurisdiction of the commis
sion. He was adjudged guilty of con
tempt, and Chairman Thomas sentenced
him to imprisonment in his own office
during business hours. This in a measure
turned the investigation into a farce, but
it assumed a more serious air as the night
progressed.
Both Esola and Lawrence brazenly ad
mitted that the former had secured his
position on the police force through the
influence of Dan Burns, and that Law
rence had "worked" Burns for the Job.
The most damaging testimony against the
ambitious lieutenant was given by ex-
Chief Lees and was strengthened by
Esola's own demeanor on the witness
stand.
Ben Chambers was recalled when the
commission resumed the investigation.
He stated that the Examiner had attack
ed McComb immediately after Esola was
discharged from his position as guard at
San Quentin and continued its abuse un
til McComb resigned. His reason for
keeping Esola in his position as long as
he nad was to keep Lawrence from at
tacking the administration of the prison.
This was simply his opinion and was not
based upon anything that Lawrence had
said to him.
"Do you know that Esola was retained
at the prison through the influence of
Lawrence?" asked Commissioner New
hall.
"That was my opinion, for I could see
no other reason for keeping him there,"
was the reply,
Ex-Police Commissioner William Al
vord testified that he had never heard of
Esola having any detective or executive
ability and that he is not the kind of
man he would select for Chief. He repu
diated a statement in the Examiner to
the effect that he indorsed Esola's can
didacy. Then came Gavin McNab. The
audience expected much from the well
known politician and it was not disap
pointed.
"I was introduced to Mr. Esola once,"
he said. "I know Andrew M. Lawrence
and I have met Mayor Phelan."
He said that while he was a Democrat
he was not aiiillated with any of the party
organizations and explained his differ
ences with the Rainey-Lawrence branch
of it. While the Democratic convention of
1599 was in Â¦session he visited the Exam
iner office with Mayor Phelan and met
Lawrence there.
The questions were then asked if the
Chief of Police matter was discussed; if
Lawrence did not demand that Esola be
appointed in the event of Phelan's elec
tion; and if Lawrence had not said that
If such an agreement was not entered
into Phelan could not expect the support
of the Examiner. Mr. McNab declined to
answer the questions, claiming that the
Commissioners had no power to compel
him to do so. Finally, when urged, he
replied to the latter In the negative, but
positively refused to answer the others.
lie was adjudged guilty of contempt, witn
the result as stated.
Many of Esola's shortcomings were re
lated by his ex-Chief, I. W. Lees, who
said that he was a disgruntled officer, un
willing to work and had never become
proficient in any of his duties. He also
said that during his brief stay In China
town he had drawn the department into
endless trouble through his inexcusable
blunders.
As a witness called by his prosecutors,
Esola was a decided success. He stated
without a blush that he was the real
thing In police officers and claimed to be
everything that Chief Lees said he was
not. After going through the story of his
early life he reached the point where he
had bloomed out as the messenger boy
for Lawrence during the Hearst Senato
rial fight at Sacramento. From that he
went on to tell how he became a guard
at San Quentln through Lawrence's Influ
ence. He denied that Chris Buckley had
anything to do with his appointment, and
contended that he had resigned from his
position as a guard and that he had not
been discharged, as the record shows. He
admitted that there Is an entry on the
prison books showing that he was dis
charged for violation of prison rules, but
asserted that he did not know it was there
until he read of it in the papers.
Getting down to the Meader affidavit,
he said he knew both Mr. and Mrs.
Meader before their marriage; that he
was present at the ceremony, and that he
gave his name to the Justice of the Peace
as Fred Harrington. His reason for do
ing it, he said, was that it was a runaway
match, and he did not want his folks to
know that he was mixed up In it. He also
admitted that while he was working at
Mayrisch's cigar factory, he was known
by the name of Harrington. He explained
this by saying that he was captured there
by one of the girls, whose name was Josie
Harrington, that in a measure she
claimed him as her particular property,
and from that on he was known by the
name of Harrington.
"I waa appointed on the police force
November 4, 1892 " he continued, "through
the influence of Dan Burns. Andrew Law
rence had requested Mr. Burns to interest
himself in my behalf."
Esola acknowledged having taken many
trips to the springs and one to the East
with Mr. Lawrence, and always drew full
pay, unless the Commissioners objected,
which they did but once.
In an effort to show that Esola had no
educational qualifications for the poslt'.oa
of Chief. Attorney McGowan wanted him
to write a simple composition on any sub
ject, but he was saved by the objections
of the Commissioners, who agreed to look
over his reports and form from them
their conclusions as to the point raised.
A. M. Lawrence testified that he had
sought Burns' assistance in gettin<
Esola on the police force. Some unim
portant testimony was given by ex-f Jeu
tenant William Price, Sergeant H. J.
Wright, Harry .N. Morse and Notary Pub
lic Craig, and the commission adjourne-l
to resume the investigation at 4 o'clock
this afternoon.
HOP SING TONG

Chinese Sleuths Work
With Police.
TERROR REIGNS IN CHINATOWN
.SCARCELY A HIGHBINDER RE
MAINS WITHIN CITY LIMITS. I
Officers Still Guard Jue Bun's Resi
dence, but Interpreters Are at
Variance as to Contents of
"Warnine Letter.
Chinese detectives were active In China
town yesterday. They swarmed into
houses In which highbinders were sup
posed to have been secreted and pointed
out to the" police a number of suspected
hatchctrcen. <Jn the strength of their
statements a few arrests were made and
one Chinaman was landed behind the
bars whom the Chinese sleuths designate
as Wong Shi Shu. the much-wanted pres
ident of the Hop Sing Tong. At present
the officers are in doubt as to whether
the information that the leader of 'the
aggressive tor.g is in the hands of the
law is correct, but they positively assert
thai if the prisoner is not at the head of
the society he is one of its leading trus
tees.
The arrest was made by Sergeant Tom
Ellis and posse, to whom the man was
pointed out by several of the Merchants'
tecrot agents, as he passed along the
street. His name was placed on the sma.l
book at the California-street Station and
the Chinese who caused his arrest have
promised positively to prove his identity.
Among the other Chinese under arrest are
Hong Dong, a merchant at COS Jackson
street, alleged to be a director of the
Suey Sing 'long, and Yee Ly, a merchant
at bio Dupont street, and supposed to be
another cirector of the same tor.g. The
arrests were made by Sergeant Duke and
OSicer Connor, who found twenty-nve
pounds of cartridges, molds for making
bullets, a M-caliber revolver and a large
dirk in Yee Ly's room. Strong evidence
has been produced to prove that both men
are connected with tne tongs, and Hong
Dong :s a areU-knoVB highbinder. Another
suspicious Chinese was arrefcled by Orticer
Callahan and others were taken as be
longing to the warrir.g tongs. None of the
Chinese have been bookeu yet, but it is
possible that an effort will be made to de
port them ail.
In the work of ridding Chinatown of the
highbinder element the police have re
ceived Federal aid. Collector of the Port
Jackson has sworn in the police officers
as United States Marshals and Dr. Gard
ner of the Chinese Bureau accompanies
Captain Wittman in his nightly raids.
Chinamen are required to exhibit their
certificates of residence or they are im
mediately turned over to the Federal au
thorities. The raids have caused terror
among the highbinders ar.d it was stated
last Dlgnt that but few of them remained
in Chinatown. The Hop Sings are Â¦ de
termined to continue the war, but there
may be a lull in the murder end of the
disturbance until after the holidays or
until the police relax their vigilance.
It is a well-known motto among Chinese
that what they cannot accomplish to-day
they may gain to-morrow, and they nrÂ«
alwayc willing to await their opportunity.

that the highbinders were about to blow

ESKRIDGE IN COMMAND.
Reported for Duty as Senior
at the Presidio Yesterday.
The Presidio has passed under the com
mand of Lieutenant Colonel Eskridge of
the Twenty-third Infantry, and Major
Cowles of the Seventeenth, who was In
command, hns charge now of the casual
detachment only. It Is getting to be a
department quite as big In Its way as the
post, and since the further shipment of
recruits from Eastern ports has been or
dered discontinued it will become still
more Important.
Colonel Maus. the Inspector general,
had the squadron of cavalry out on the
parade ground yesterday afternoon. A
full dress parade and review were fol
lowed by some troop maneuvers, and then
the troop quarters and stables were In
spected.
Major Rucker of the Sixth Cavalry,
whom rumor so persistently assigns to
the command of the post, reported for
duty yesterday, but he did not take com
mand of the squadron during the inspec
tion.
COLONEL G. H. MENDELL, U. S. A.
ONE of the few good appointments made by Mayor Phelan was that
of Colonel George H. Mendell. U. S. A., president of the Board of
Public W orks. Colonel Mendell Is an officer of the United States
army, drawing a regular salary from the Government, although on
the retired list. According to the provisions of the new charter he
must resign his/Government office in order to serve the city. The best
lawyers of San Francisco assert that the charter provision in this case is
clear and explicit. Section 4 of article 16 is as follows:
Section 4. Any person holding a salaried office under the city
and county, whether by election or appointment, who shall during
his term of office hold or retain any other salaried office under the
Government of the United States, or of this State, or who shall hold
any other salaried office connected with the government of the city
and county, or who shall become a member of the Legislature, shall
* be deemed to have thereby vacated the office held by him under the
city and county.
A similar question was raised In California when General Stoneman was
elected Governor. The result was the army resignation of the general. It will
be recalled that Governor Stoneman was restored to the retired list after
his term of office as Governor expired, but the restoration was not obtained
without a struggle in Congress.
It is to be regretted that the charter did not make an exception In
favor of eminent engineers on the army retired list, because Colonel Men
dell is an engineer of recognized worth and energy. He can hardly be ex
pected to resign his rank and emoluments in the army to accept service in
civil life for the brief term of three years.
The pay of a retired colonel is $4125 per annum, while the salary of a
commissioner In the department of public works Is only $4000, a year. The
salary of a retired army officer is not a pension. An officer on the retired
list may be called to duty for attack or defense In case of emergency.
"THE IDOL'S EYE"
AT THE TIVOLI
5T is undoubtedly a difficult thing to
write a comic opera libretto of re
spectable cleverness, but there is no
excuse, and should be no pardon, for
some of the stuff that Is handed out by
Harry B. Smith. In "The Idol's Eye" he
is at his worst. The humor of the book,
or what passes for humor, is of a type
unworthy even of reprobation. There Is
not a thing that is said in the entire piece
that can raise a legitimate laugh, and if
the performance Is amusing it Is due more
to the business than to the lines, more to
the actors than to the author.
Victor Herbert's music 16. as good us
anything he has done, which may not he
saying a great deal, but some of It is cer
tainly several degrees better than tiie
frothy stuff of which he has turned aut
such a vast quantity.
There are three life-sized comedy parts
In "The Idol's Eye," Abel Conn. Jamie
McSnuffy and Don Pablo Tobasco, but
there is not enough mirth-making matter
in the whole trio to outfit one good come
dian. Ferris Hartman takes first place,
of course, and does the best he can with
a banal part.
Alf Wneelan is occasionally ludicrous
as the Scot, but he overreaches his intent
to be funny by the most extravagant ex
aggeration, and depends too much on the
variety of disgusting noises he makes to
win a laugh. The comic opportunities of
the Scotch character are so great that it
is a pity he should throw them away. The
chief claim of. Don Pablo Tobasco (which
part is assumed by William Schuster) to
be considered comic Is his whiskers,
which supply one of the most Important
comedy el#ments of the opera, and there
you have a very fair Idea of the kind of
stuff Mr. Smith has to offer.
There is much to commend in the stag
ing of the piece, and Its costuming as
well, and. finally, there is one feature of
the performance that has a value of its
own and is worth all the rest of the show
put together. This is the singing of Miss
Frances Graham, a contralto of unusual
gifts, who makes her first appearance Â»n
this production. She has a truly fine
voice, limited in power, but of a pure and
rich quality. She has temperament ai.d
style, sweetness and good method, and is
a great .acquisition to the Tlvoil forces.

HUBER'S LITTLE TRIP
NIPPED IN THE BUD
DETECTIVES ARREST HIM AT
THE MOLE.
The Bartender Found $500 and Was
Starting on a Journey to
Germany.
George Huber, a German bartender em
ployed at the Oberon, was arrested Thurs
day afternoon at the Oakland mole by
Detectives Wren and Gibson and placed
in the tanks at the City Prison, whence
he was taken last night and charged with
grand larceny.
Huber, who is a rather verdant Ger
man, might have been booked on a more
serious charge had not the detectives ap
prehended him in the nick of time. On
Monday afternoon J. C. Columbus, a
storekeeper at Dyea, Alaska, wandered
Into the Oberon to get a glass of beer.
While the waiter was at the bar procuring
the liquid Columbus Blipped into the lav
atory, where he dropped a money belt
containing $300 in gold and greenbacks.
Columbus, who did not notice his loss,
paid for his drink and left the place.
Immediately after Columbus departed
Huber went into the lavatory, where he
found the money belt lying on the floor.
He threw the belt away and pocketing
the money walked up to the bar and re
signed his position.
"I'm going back to Germany," said Hu
ber to Mr. Fisher, the proprietor of the
place, as he threw a 20-dollar gold piece
on the counter and called for a bottle of
wine. Huber only gets $20 a month and
his sudden display of wealth amazed his
employer.
After enjoying several bottles of. wine
Huber left the place and started out to
paint the tenderloin a' bright crimson hue.
He hunted up a few friends and took
them all to a dinner at a famous restau
rant, where he Insisted that the waiter
should put a bunch of flowers in the cus
pidor alongside the table.
On Wednesday Huber bought a ticket
for New York and from there to Hamburg
and had the ticket agent buy him a draft
for 1000 marks on one of the Hamburg
banks. He was scheduled to leave for
New York on Wednesday night, but he
stopped to have too many drinks along
the line and he arrived at the ferry in
time to see the boat pulling out of the
slip.
Detectives Wren and Gibson went over
to Oakland Thursday night and found
Huber standing on the mole waiting for
the overland to start. Fearing that Hu
ber would make his escape In a handcar
standing near by the detectives placed him
under arrest. He readily admitted hav
ing taken the money. In the three days
Huber was in possession of the cash he
managed to spend $110.

It !s enconraylns to see a genuine inter
est shown by our public in chamber mu
sic. It is not only an evidence of good
taste, but of sincerity. The fourth con
5. crt ,, of .. tne Ml "ettl Quartet drew a prac
tically full house at Sherman & Clay Hall
yesterday afternoon, and the affair as
usual, proved an artistic success. The
programme began with the Grieg cuar
tet. In B-flat major. Op. 27. a compos.
tlon full of fancy and quaintness. The
poetry and pathos of Grieg were well ex
pressed, particularly in the Romanize.
Mr. v elss contributed a 'cello solo-
Hungarian rhapsodic by Popper, and re
sponded to an encore with a berceuse of
Simon, the latter with superior art and
delicacy. Mr. Weiss' tone Is dependable,
but the same cannot always be said of his
execution. He was accompanied by Mr
Ormay.
In the piano trio (G minor. Op. 15) of
Smetana one found much of the same
mysticism which pervades his exquisite
"Aus Meinen Leben." though the trio Is
of sturdier stuff. It was the most inter
esting number of the afternoon ar.d was
played with purpose and finish
Mr. Fleishman at the piano is to be com
plimented for his work. He had admir
able command of the Instrument, and
something more, that is felt rather than
expressed. It is regrettable that we do
not hear him oftener.

DORIC BRINGS
NEWS FROM THE
HAWAIIAN ISLES
Many People Anxious
to Leave.
AUSTRALIA WILL BE CROWDED
BABK AGATE HAD A BOUGH
TRIP TO MOLOKAL
Naval Transport Scindia Will Take
Supplies to Guam â Reinsurance
Paid on Two More
Overdues.
The steamer Doric arrived yesterday
from the Orient via Honolulu and was
placed in quarantine. The cabin passen
gers were afterward allowed to land, but
the vessel will be detained until she has
been thoroughly fumigated. The Doric
beat the China's time from Yokohama to
Honolulu by three hours and came from
Honolulu to San Francisco in five days
seventeen hours. She brought forty-six
cabin, ore second cabin and one Japanese
and eighty-six Chinese in the steerage.
Among those who came over on the Doric
were Rear Admiral Fitzgerald, Captain
S. C. Cowille. Lieutenant Bodan Smith, R.
C. Baker and \V. Hodder. all of the En
glish navy; Captain Loukianoff and Lieu
tenant Kowymini of the Russian army;
Lieutenant Commander C. Thomas, U. S.
N.. and Lieutenant C. E. Crosby of the
English Naval Reserve
The Doric brings the news that heroic
measures are being taken in Honolulu to
combat the plague. One block of build
ings was burned in order to erad
icate the disease. None of the sailing ves
sels are allowed to take away passengers,
so there is a great rush to get away on
the Australia, which sails from Honolulu
next Tuesday. When the Doric was there
more than a hundred and forty people
had taken cabin passage on the vessel.
In order to get away by the mail boat
they had to keep themselves strictly away
from the infected part of the town and
present themselves each day for examina
tion to Dr. Carmichael, United States
Quarantine Officer. If he certifies next
Tuesday that each and all of the appli
cants for passage to San Francisco are in
good health then the agents of the vessel
will sell them tickets and they will come
home. Those who cannot pass the quar
antine officer will have to remain behind.
The barn Agate, which arrived In the
lsiands while the Doric was at Honolulu,
had a terrible passage down from Puget
Sound. When a weeit out she was caught
in a terrllic storm. A big sea broke
aboard and flooded the cabin. Captain
Hanson's wife was sick in her bed at
the time. -She was washed out Into the
main cabin and nearly drowned before
being rescued. One of the water casks
was washed away and the vessel sprang
a leak. All hands were put on a short
allowance of water, but luckily a few
days later a ship came along and supplied
the Agate with 200 gallons of the much
needed fluid. It took the bark forty-eight
days to reach Hawaii and when the an
chor was let go the entire crew was In a
state of collapse.
The wreck of the San Francisco owned
barkentine William Carson was moored
in a safe position when the Doric sailed.
The officers of the Doric say that the
prospects for getting the wreck Into port
were good.
The transport Centennial was returned
to her owners yesterday and the work
of taking the Government supplies out
of her was begun at once. All the stalls
for horses that have been erected forward
will be kept on her, while those aft will
be torn down. As soon as this work is
accomplished the Centennial will begin
loading for Kahulul on her owners' ac
count.
The steamer Pennsylvania has been re
chartered by the Government and Is now
busy loading supplies for the troops In
Manila.
The naval transport Sclndla came down
from Mare Island yesterday and will sail
this afternoon or early to-morrow for
Guam. She has nearly 8000 tons of cargo
aboard, of which over 5000 tons Is coal.
After discharging at Guam the Scindia
will go on to Manila. Captain Miller, late
of the Badger, Is In command of the
Scindia and he Is taking out with him
100 apprentice boys to distribute among
the fleet in the Philippines. The Scindia
has no steam launch, so as a mark of
their appreciation of his courtesies during
their cruise on the Badger the Naval
Battalion placed the Marion's launch at
Captain Miller's disposal.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Colon arrived from Panama and way
ports yesterday.
The underwriters are now paying 10 per
cent to reinsure the British ship Holy
wood, out 175 days from Antwerp for
Honolulu, and 8 per cent to reinsure the
Pass of Killiecrankie, now out 164 days
from Swansea for San Francisco.
The United States cruiser Ranger came
down from Mare Island last night and
will leave at 10 a. m. to-day for Panama.
On the way down the coast she will over
take the Pacific squadron and deliver
some Important dispatches from the Navy
Department to Admiral Kautz.
The Ranger goes to Panama to survey
portions of the bay. and from there will
proceed up the Gulf of California on a
surveying cruise. When this work Is
completed Fhe may possibly go to the
Philippine Islands to survey the spot
whore the Charleston was wrecked, re
turning to San Francisco the latter part
of this year.
The following named officers are at
tached to the Ranger: Commander W. L.
Field, commanding; Lieutenant J. H. L.

credit.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
BUSWmED WOMEN,
We look in amazement at the burdens
tome women carry upon their heads.
Yet how liglit they are compared -with
the burdens some women carry upon
their hearts. There are childless women
Â¦whose hearts ache ceaselessly because of
the childless home. That burden of
childlessness has been lifte^f from the
heart of many a woman by the use of
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. Many
of the obstacles to maternity are remov-
eble. Such obstacles are entirely re-
moved by "Favorite Prescription." It
contains no alcohol nor narcotic
Harried Six Years and Childless.
" I have never written you how prat tf ul I am
to yon fur your help in securing pood health and
cne of the sweetest, dearest, thirteen pound
girls that ever came into a home," writes Mrs. M.
Via* me, of 647 South Ãberty Street. Galcstaorg,
111. â¢ I took six bottles of Dr. Pierces Favorite
Prescription, four of the 'Golden Medical Dis-
covery { and four viaU of Dr. Pierces Pleasant
Pellets. Before I had taken four bottles of the
â¢ Favorite Prescription ' I waa a new woman, I
cannot meke pen describe my heartfelt grati-
tude, to will close by saying If any one disputes
the value of Dr. Pierces medicines I will be
pleased to confirm the truth of all I say if they
will enclose stamped envelope lor reply."
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are a
ladies' laxative. No medicine equals
them lot gentleness and thoroughness.
