Q*i LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
trJA TON. Jan. 4. -it is apparent to the
{djX authorities that Great Britain can-
not continue' interrupting neutral
trad* with a neutral territory without in
volving herself in serious complications.
So far as this Government is concerned, it
Is disposed to deal leniently with the Lon
don Government, while at the same time
safeguarding the Interests of American
citizens; but it is believed, in view of the
present state of feeling in Germany and
other Continental nations of Europe, that
a continuance of the policy of capturing
foreign merchant vessels may be produc
tive of intervention, which England is. de
sirous of avoiding.
It is felt by the authorities here that the
time has cemf- for the British Government
to declare what it considers contraband of
war. This Government has not requested
the London authorities to give an expres
sion on this point, but it is felt that if any
additional American cargoes are seized it
may become necessary to do so. The cap
ture of German mail steamers is naturally
a very different matter from the seizure of
American cargoes in foreign bottoms, for
in the former case there is the added in
jury sustained by the flag.
% Alexander Porter Morse, the well-known
international law expert, thus explained
the law in the case of the detention of the
German steamer General at Aden: Â«" -
"I assume that Germany can and Â£ill
safeguard the neutral rights of German
shippers and shipowners in the latest re
ported case of detention of the German
steamer General at Aden by the British
authorities. I am entirely satisfied that
the neutral rights of American shippers
and shipowners may be safely Intrusted
to the Secretary of State and the Ameri
can Embassador at London, without any
assistance from the outside. There are
?ome general principles, however, which
usually guide civilized states in this re
gard, which may be stated in response to
your inquiries.
"The principles upon which our Govern
ment and public vessels proceeded during
the civil war were embodied In instruc
tions issued by the Navy Department un
der the authority of the President.
"The Bubstance of them was that a ves
sel was not to be seized without a search
carefully made bo far as to render it rea
sonable to believe that she was engaged

band or which has- become so from speciai
circumstances of war is liable to confis

together with a reasonable profit, usually
calculated at 10 per cent on the amount.
This mitigation of extreme privileges i-=
also introduced in the case of products
native of the exporting country, even
when they are affected by an Inseparable
taint of contraband."
WILLIAM GROWS
WRATH Y OVER
THE SEIZURES
BERLIN. Jan. 4.â The imperial mail
steamer General has been detained at
Aden and occupied by British troops with
the object of searching her cargo, which
is to be discharged. The General is owne.l
by the German East African line, the
owners of the Bundesrath. previously
captured by the British cruiser Magicicune
off Delagoa.
The seizure of the imperial steamer Gen
eral has considerably aggravated the sit
uation here, and the indignation against
England is intensified. The Government
Is still earnestly endeavoring to preserve
correct official relations, but England wiH
do well to hasten to make the amende
honorable to Germany.
On absolutely reliable authority the cor
respondent of the Associated Press learns
that Emperor William is now thoroughly
aroused by the repeated seizures of ves
sels, not one of which, he has been as
sured, is guilty of carrying contraband:
He" regards the seizures as high-handÂ»d
proceedings which Engtauu would not
have dared to undertake if the German
navy were more powerful than It is. His
Majesty is s?id to he particularly in
censed because ir. formation has reached
him showing that the seizures were not
dtw( to the blundering' of British naval
officers, but to strict orders from rfiead
q'ia?tÂ»rs. which the officers are , merely
ran?vtnÂ«r out- He h*sthercffwiÂ» instructed
Coitrit yon Bulow, the Foreign Secretary,
to' demand exact and full reparation for
the outrage done to the German flag.
No answer that Is consiuered satisfac
tory has been received from London, and
according to advices here none is to be,
expected for several days longer. 'i
To-day's news, induced *^
German Government to send another 2yv
more strongly worded protest to London*
Significant of the intensity of Germany's
indignation ajainst England in this mat
ter is a declaration published to-day by
the German Colonial Society, among
whose 60.000 members are a number of
reigning German Princes, which says:
"England's recent proceedings against
German vessels are an outrage. The fact
remains that the small respect which the
English people feel for Germany because
of her deficiency In naval power has taken
such deep root that the commanders of
English warships hasten to commit
breaches of International rights so long
as only Germany 13 thereby touch This
lack of fear to touch the German flag
must be thoroughly and speedily cured."
Indignation meetings have been called
by branches of the Colonial Society. The
German press, with hardly an exception,
thunders against England. Even the semi
official Berliner Post says: "It cannot be
denied that the indignation aroused by the
willfulness of the seizures by British com
mar.ders is spreading in wider and wider
circles."
HAMBURG. Jan. 4.â The German East
African Company publishes a statement
in the Hamburger Nachrichten saying
that Immediately upon the declaration of
war the company voluntarily refused to
forward to South Africa two consign
ments of arms already on board their
vessels, simply to avoid trouble and de
lay In connection with the other portions
of the cargoes.
A copy of the manifest of the Bundes
rath has been published, showing that her
cargo did not contain contraband. The
owners declare that there is absolutely
no foundation for the statement that sad
dles and other war material have been
found amid the cargo of the Bundesrath.
VIENNA, Jan. 4. â Diplomats here seem
to consider that Great Britain ought not
to have searched a German steamer In the
Suez canal.
The Welner Allgemelne Zeltung says
"lt looks as if Great Britain cared lsss
for the cargo In question than for demon
strating before the world that, although
most unlucky on the land, she is the ua
chalUrfiged mistress of the sea, a demon
stration which will do more for the Ger
man navy than all the ships of Emperor
William.

RENSBERG. CAPE COLONY, Wednes
day, Jan. 3.â We set fire last flight to the
trucks of the wrecked train and their con
tents, and they are etill blazing. The
New South Wales Lancers performed the
duty under a heavy shell and rifle fire, to
which we replied. This lasted until mid
day, the Boers trying to loot the burning
trucks, but being compelled by our sheV
fire to retire.
Shrapnel burst right among them sev
eral times and must have done consider
able damage, many riderless horses rush
ing aboutthe veldt. Some of the'enemy
took shelter in the station house, but
were shelled out. The survivors galloped
away. -The Boers were seen to gallop a
gun through one of the passes. As they
I did so our artillery opened fire on them.
these recent small engagements
are all . done for the purpose of
keeping down Dutch disaffec

be many more of the same kind
during. the next week or two.
From the important positions
at Modder River and Tugela lit
tle fresh intelligence came. At
Tugela yesterday the Boers'
trenches were subjected to what
seems to have been a very vig
orous bombardment, which did a
good deal of damage and stam
peded some of their horses. The
forces on each side may be
roughly stated as follows,
though from the nature of things
the figures for the Boers cannot
be more than a guess : ' Buller,

2000 artillery- and 7O\guns; Jou-.

quickly converted a drawn battle
into a British victory ,4;he Boers
being driven out of Molteno and
back to their old positions at
Stormberg. It seems as if the
Boers' ruse was to leid Gatacre
into the difficult country which
was the scene of his reverse, but
the device failed. After taking

STERKSTROOM. "Wednesday. Jan. 3.â
Early yesterday morning a large force of
Boers descended from Stormberg. on Mol
teno. which they occupied. They then
proceeded to attack an outpost of fifty men
stationed south of the town, at the same
time cutting the telegraph wire to the
south of them. This maneuver was. how
ever, too late, for authorities at Sterk-
stroom had warning and a reinforcing
force of Kaffrarian Rifles under Captain
Bonnie Me Lain pushed forward from
Bushmans Hock.
Firing quickly commenced and went on
for some hours until the enemy with one
gun withdrew, taking n^> a position on th*
hill ac Cyphergat. to the southeast of Mol
teno. From here they fired on an armored
train with effect.
General Gatacre then moved cp from
Sterkstroom with infantry, the Cape

WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.â ln addltfoa tr>
Indirect suggestions from the Transvaal
Government for the mediation of the
United States to bring an end to the war.
Secretary Hay has been deluged with
requests from foreign and domestic bodies
and American citizens to use the Influence
of the United States to put a stop to fur-
Lboth MmwSferz and, Mol
teno 'WÂ«Dndon receives
more cheering news this morning
than it did yesterday. Whether
General French has really been
reinforced from De Aar or not, it
is at least certain that his force
is holding back the Boers, al
though the town of Colesberg it
self has not yet been occupied,
and the enemy is being gradually
encircled. Moreover, the Boers'
retreat into Orange Free State
by the road to Bothas Drift is
cut off. The only possible route
open to them is that toward
Nojvals Point, whither some of
the Boers are reported to be al
ready making their way.- A pre
vious report has stated that Xor
vals Point bridge is commanded
by British guns.
The attack on Molteno, which
yesterday was only a matter of
report, is to-day confirmed. The
Boers are now in retreat. After
a night's march a force of
burghers of Stormberg seized
Molteno at daybreak on
Wednesday, at the same time
developing attacks upon the
Cape Mounted Rifles on the west
and on the Royal Irish Rifles
and others on the east of the
town. Although the little Brit
ish force at Bushmans Hock did
its best it could not induce the
in carrying, contraband of war for or to
belligerents and to their ports directly or
indirectly by trans-shipment, or otherwise
violating the blockade. As early as ITS 2
the Congress of the confederation de
clared it to be lawful to capture and ob-.
tain condemnation of all contraband
goods, wares and merchandise, to what
ever nations belonging, although found in
a neutral bottom, if destined for the use
of the enemy, and it was neld by the Su
preme Court in 1566 that contraband m-r
chandise is subject to a different rule in
respect to ulterior destination than that
which applies to merchandise not contra
band. The latter is liable to capture only
when a violation of the blockade Is In
tended; the former when destined to a
hostile country or to actual military or
naval use of the enemy, whether block
aded or not. Trade of neutrals with bel
ligerents in articles not contraband Is ab
solutely free unless interrupted by block
ade: conveyance by neutrals to belliger
ent." of contraband articles is always un
lawful and such articles may always be
seized during transit by sea. As there is
no blockade of a neutral port short of an
act of war the question of blockade does
not arise in respect to Lourenzo Marquez.
A well-informed publicist has eaid that
the interests of peace and commerce on
one hand and those of war on the other
have In conflict of forces rested at a prac
tical line of settlement.
"Interests of peace have prevailed so far
as to permit the carrier to transport con
traband goods subject to no other penalty
than loss of his commercial enterprise,
i. c., his freight and expense, while the in
terests of war have prevailed so far as to
permit a belligerent to stop contraband
goods on their passage and convert them
into his own use. The advantage of this
is that the carrying trade of the world
may go on subject to ascertainable risks,
which may be provided for by contract
and guarded against by insurance, and
producers and merchants can, continue
their business and procure transportation
without criminality, taking the risk of
capture and condemnation of noxious ar
ticles. *
"At the same time belligerents have fur

all Interests Involved, whether vessel or
cargo, if there have been fraudulent prac

POLICE JUDGE MORTIMER SMITH OF OAKLAND.
Police Judsre Mortimer Smith of Oak- 1
land indulged in a midnight â¢supper with |
some of those arrested at the now famous j
.â ra Oaklandâ raid of the crat> said*: run- j
ntnginJoe RosehbersTa ciga/ store, and.
this little fact is assuming maj\s than gas- Â¦
tronomic importance.
jt is not that Police Judge Smith should [
fl}jp out, but that he should sup uuJf r j
->ach circumstances and with such com- ;
panions, which has caused the-^neident to
assume unusual proportions.
fThe Police Judge's little midnight sup
per occurred just as December IT Â«ai
merging into December IS. That was just
after the police had raided Joe Rosen
berg's cigar store and captured the crao
game that was there running.
This crap game and the raid upon it have
caused a great deal of trouble in Oakland.
and the incidents following it seem bound
to cause more. In the first place. Joe Ro
senberg is pretty well known in Oakland
and runs a very prominent place. Not
only was the game raided, but afterward
Rosenberg was arrested for permitting a
game to be run on his premises. This
made him very angry, and he has been
threatening all kinds of vengeance against
the police.
The police watched the place for a num
ber of nights, and, finally, just before mid
night, on December 17 they descended In a
body upon th? store, forced an entrance
and arrested half a dozen players and S.
J. Richardson, the banker, and later Joe
Rosenberg was charged with keeping a
place used for gambling purposes.
When the players were arrested they
sent for Harry Pulcifer. as their attorney,
for Joe Rosenburg to bail them out, and
Police Judge Mortimer Smith to fix the
bail. Before Judge Smith arrived the
police had fixed the bail at $30 for each
player and JICO for the banker. Bonds
Â¦were put up in most of the instances and
Joe Rosenberg furnished the money.
It took some time to have these little
preliminaries arranged. Then the play
ers gradually drifted out of the police sta
tion and back to their homes. They did
not like their experience and were pretty
free in their denunciation of the police for
the raid.
Then came Police Judge Smith's mid
night supper that has since made all the
trouble. After the prisoners had been
bailed, the Police Judge went to what Is
known as the "New Postofflce Restau
rant." on Eleventh street, between Broad
way ar.d Washington. This is an all
night enfe. m which there are a lot of

and S. J. Richardson, who was charged
with being the banker of the game.

very long and was decorous in the ex
treme. It is not of record who paid tbÂ»
bill, but that a Police Judge should have
gone out with men upon whom he *Â»J

cause of additional trouble and turmoil
surrounding the crap cases.
It 13 said that Police Judge Smltn was
heard to sympathize with the players o!
the game and to hold that there waÂ»
doubtful cause of action, and that the bait
demanded was excessive. There was
earnest dlacussicn cf these matters in the
little box over the midnight supper.
Police Judge Mortimer Smith admits hl3
visit to the restaurant with the men who
had just been released from prison, and
whom he was expected to try for crime in
his own court. But he denied any wrong

ROLAND REED IS
ON THE VERGE OF DEATH
Forced to Undergo a Second Opera
tion, but Scant Hopes for. His
Rerovery Entertained.
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. I.â The friends
of Roland Reed In this city were advised
to-day that Dr. Bull, the famous surgeon,
had perfomed a second operation upon
the comedian in New York. The first
operation, performed about a week ago,
was supposed to have been made neces
sary' by an attack of appendicitis. When
the wound was explored, however, the
surgeons discovered that Mr. Reed was
suffering from an advanced attack of in
testinal cancer.
Mr. Reed was too weak to stand a radi
cal operation at that time and a delay
was agreed upon. The radical operation
was performed to-day, and from its na
ture little hope is held out for his re
covery. Should he survive the shock of
the operation he will. In all probability,
be an invalid for some time.

of an effective force of about 63.000 men:
The army now in the Philippines aggre-
ther hostilities. As was announced yester
day, the President has no intention of in
terfering in the war unless Great Britain
Indicates that she, too, desires the aid of
the friendly offices of this Government
It Is the present understanding of officials
that there Is no likelihood of the British
Government requesting the President to
interfere, and It is apparent, that she pro
poses to continue the war until the subju
gation of the Boers Is completed. It is to
be expected that as the success of the
British continues appeals from friends of
the Boers and perhaps from the Boers
themselves will grow in volume, but the
administration will turn a deaf ear to
them. . Â¦

monetary system.
The third section makes it the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury as fast as standard
silver dollars are coined as required by law
from the bullion purchased under the act of
July J4. 1896, to retire and cancel an equal
amount of Treasury notes, and provides that
upun the cancellation of the notes eilver certi

The fourth section authorizes and directs the
Secretary of the Treasury to reopen deposits of
gold coin and to issue gold certificates therefor
in denominations of not less than J2Q. The pro
visions of this t-ectinu are !n most respects the
same as those contained In the twelfth section
of the act of July 12, ISS2. The purpose ol the
f-ectlon as a whole Is to give certain and ac
tive monetary use to the large and rapidly in

The fifth section provides that no United

be Issued or reissued in denominations of less
than $10. and all such not*-s of a smaller de
nomination whenever redeemed shall be fan
ceK J and notes of $10 or upward substituted
therefcir. It also provides that no silver cer
tificates cf a higher denomination than JlO
shall be issued.
The olxth section of the substitute gives to
the Secretary of the Treasury authority to
convert * portion of the national debt into
bonds bearing 2 per cent Interest. The propo
sition contemplates a profitable anticipation
of Interest payments and consequent reduction
of the public debt. In order to Induce the
holders of the outstanding bonds to consent
to the conversion proposed and in consideration
<-f the reduction of interest effected thereby
the Secretary of the Treasury !s authorized to
ray them in exchange a sum not greater than
the present worth of surh bonds, computed to
yield an income of t% per cent per annum and
their i>ar value.
The surplus In the Treasury over and above
the amount required for an adequate working
balance and for the reserved fund created by
this bill would allow the Secretary to pay with
out difficulty the $Â£5. 000.000 which would' be re
quired to effect this reduction of Interest. In
fact, under present conditions and with the
necessity confronting us of more promptly
turning current receipts back into the channels
of business the payments suggested would af
ford welcome relief from dangerous congestion.
Aldrich, in discussing the effect of this
transaction on the national debt, said the
committee was of the opinion that it
would not place this portion of the na
tional debt beyond the control of the
Government. Continuing he said:
We trust that our expenditures will soon be
on a peace footing, but we muFi realize that we
shall have large disbursements for some time to
come, which It may not l>e possible to pay
from the current revenues. In conflderlng the
pootbUlUea of the future we cannot overlook
the fact that the national <>bts of the wnrM
have lnrreasfti at an as-tonishint; rate. We be
lieve It is Impossible to overestimate the ad
vantage which would accrue to the I'nifd
Stats from.rlai-ins its national debt upon a 2
per cent basis and keeping its obligations issued
at thia rat* at par in the markets of the world.
" â¢ â¢ One of the principal reasons which led
the committee to recommend this plan of con
version xvas that the bonds suggested would be
much morÂ« desirable as a basis for national
bank note circulation than the outstanding se
curities. It is the duty nf Congreps, In the
rubllc Interest, to so mo.llfy the national bank
ing act as to give to banking affiliations an
opportunity to Issue currency with a reason
able profit. If the provisions of this bill are
enacted, into law, we may expect a considerable
InereaFe in .the national bank note circulation
in the near fjture, and there is no reason, If
thÂ» buiÂ«!nep* of the country demands It. why
In time the outstanding circulation should not
equal the cafKalizntion of the banks!
The seventl* section provides that upon the
fleposit of Ui*\i<Â»d frlat.-* bonds by any national
banning ass.x-iatlin in the manner provided by
law. such a.-psciatlor* shall be entitled to re
ceive cireulaUr.K notes etjual to. the par value
of the bonds deposited. It also provides that
any national banking association now having
bonds on deposit ehall be entitled to the game
privilege.
The .-l&hth section provides that any national
bunking: association having on deposit as se-?
curlty for Its circuiting notes bonds of the*
I nite<J States bearing Interest at 2 per cent per
annum shall pay a tax on such circulating notes
of one-half of one per cent annually Instead of
the tax of one per cent now imposed by law
Vie believe this reduction in taxation is nec
tary to encourage national banks to increase
their circulation, and it will undoubtedly have
the effect of promoting the conversion of bonds
provided for in the sixth section.
Aldrich received the interested attention
or all the Senators present, but he waÂ«
not Interrupted by. any one. At the close
of the speech the Senate went into execu
tive session, adjourning" at- 2:30 o'clock un

sion was brief again to-day, tne only In
cident being the adoption of the Sulzer
resolution introduced: yesterday calling
upon Secretary Gage for information re
garding the deposit of Government funds
in certain New York national banks. The
resolution as adopted was made more gen
eral In its scope, and an -amendment was
added to cover information; respecting
the transactions relating, to the sale of
the New York Custom-house site. Sec
retary Gage's friends had been Informed
that he courted the fullest investigation
and was prepared to submit all the facts
to Congress. Accordingly there was no
friction over the passage -of the resolu
tion. which was unanimously adopted.
Payne, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, presented the Sul
zer resolution, as modified by the commlt
t<Â»e, for Immediate consideration.
The resolution, as modified, is as fol
lows:
nesolv-e<l. That the Secretary of the Treasury

either of them, since the 4th day of March, ISB7,
relating to the depositing of public funds,
bonds or rewnufs In said bank or banks, or
any other relations or business transactions

or revenue deposited with said banks, or either
of them, with any national bank by the Gov
ernment, upon what security, for what length
Â¦of time-, and the reasons therefor; and whether

request was compiled with, and Levy -of
fered an amendment to the resolution
which Included a request for the Secre
tary's reasons for delaying the deposits
in national banks until the panic had oc
currt-d.
Levy said he had warned the Secretary
of the Treasury In September that the
panic was Imminent. Had the Secretary
heeded that warning and deposited Gov
ernment funds in national banks Jn Sep
tember and October, instead' of buying
bonds, the panic would have been averted
The amendment was promptly ruled out
of order and the resolution as offered lÂ»y
Payne was adopted.

til Monday.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 5, 1900.
TRANSPORT VICTORIA
REPORTED MISSING
Freighter in the GoverQment Ser
vice Causes War Officials
Considerable Anxiety.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan.
4.â Considerable apprehension is expressed by officials of the War Depart
ment for the safety of the transport Victoria, which left San Francisco for
Manila during the middle of October. Quartermaster General Ludington has
sent a cablegram to Major General Otis requesting him to take such action
for locating the missing ship or determining what has become of her that
may seem proper. Fortunately the Victoria is not a passenger transport, but
a freighter, which was employed to convey army supplies to the Philip
pines. She has no troops aboard. In making the contract for chartering the
vessel Major O. F. Long, quartermaster at San Francisco, used the regular
form under which the Government is released from liability in case of the
loss of the ship.
The transport Victoria, on which the underwriters are now paying 20 per
cent reinsurance, left this port seventy-eight days ago, and was spoken by
the transport Tartar on November 9. At that time the thrust block of her
main shaft was broken. Assistance was offered, but the captain of the Victo
ria refused it. saying there was no danger. The Victoria was loaded with sup
plies and carried no passengers.
FOUR SHOT BY A
DRUNKEN INDIAN
Tragedy in a Piute Set
lement in Oregon.
PORTLAND, Jan. 4.â A special to the
Oregonlan from Prinevllle, Crook County,
Or., says: A tragedy occurred near here
among a circle of Plute Indians that has
co far resulted in the death of one Indian,
One squaw, and the probably fatal injury
of another man and two w.omen. Whisky
is at the bottom of the trouble. Matthew
Wewa did the Bhootlng with a Winchester
j rifle, which he turned on himself with
j fatal results.
Wewa had a tepee near here, with some
other Piutea and a few . Warm Springs.
On the evening of December 2 Wewa re
turned to his tepee badly Intoxicated, and
his savage temper caused alarm In the
family clrcie, consisting of his brother
] Charley, his wife Happie and two BQUaira
named Tyler and Susie, who were gam
bling. Wewa took offense at something
his wife was doing and commenced beat-
Ing her. His brother Charley interfered
in her behalf. This enraged Wewa and he
seized his Winchester, rushed outside and
i commenced shooting.
liaising the flap of the tepee so he could
point hfe gun In, he shot his brother Char
ley, who fell to the ground seriously
wounded. Then Wewa shot his wife Hap
pie. The two other squaws made wild
rushes for the tepee door to escape. Wewa
was too quick for them, however, shoot-
Ing both of them before they ould get
away. Then he walked some distance
from the scene of his bloody work, turned
the rifle upon himself and ended his lifo
with a single shot. Happie died before
help could arrive. Charley, Tyler and Su
sie were g-iven what medicaJ attention
could be secured, but their cases seem
hopeless.

BEET SUGAR FACTORY
FOR ARKANSAS VALLEY
Location "Was Once Known as Part
of the Great American
Desert.
CHICAGO, Jan. 4.â lt was announced to
day at Santa Fe headquarters that the
American Beet Sugar Company had con
tracted for the establishment of a beet
sugar plant at Rocky Ford, Colo., in tho
Arkansas Valley. The plant will be next
to the largest in, the world, and will have
a capacity greater than the combined
plants in Nebraska. It will cost about
$500,000 and will have an annual capacity
of 18,800 tons of refined sugar, using 100,000
tons of beets. Farmers in the valley ad
jacent to Rocky Ford have arranged to
plant 80,000 acres of beets the coming sea
son, from which It is expected a profit of
$40 an acre will be realized.
The land is almost in tho heart of what
a few years ago appeared on the map as
the "Great American Desert." Irrigation
has made it one of the most fertile places
in that section of the West. It Is said
that the beet sugar plant will distribute
something like $1,500,01)0 annually to farm
ers and employes. It Is said two more
large plants will be established In the Ar
kansas Valley within the next two or
three yeprs.
LITTLE LIFE IN THE

CAMBRIDGE, Jan. 4.â Alexander Agas
slz, director of the Agasslz Museum at
Harvard, has just sent a letter from the
Island of Tahiti, In the Pacific Ocean, to
the United States Fish Commissioner.
Professor Agassiz left San Francisco In
the Albatross, a vessel loaned him by the
Government, to study the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean.
He made seventy-two Mundlngs In the
hitherto unknown basin at the bottom of
the ocean. A large amount of animal
matter was Btudied from the dredging
from the bottom of the ocean, with tho
general conclusion that there Is little life
in the deeper part of the sea fiir away
from land. The last heard from Professor

"WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.â The Senate

of the United States toward the island.
The prevailing opinion seemed to be
favorable to the Teller amendment prom
ising independence to the Cubans as soon
as pacific conditions could be restored.
There was some talk of having the com
mittee make a trip to Cuba for the pur
pose of investigating conditions there, but
no conclusion was reached.

resignation to Senor SHvela, the Premier,
as the result of differences between him

regarding the Government's budgetary
proposals.
M. PAUL DEROULEDE, THE FRENCH AGITATOR.
Paul Deroulede was born i n 1848, and In his time has been perhaps more
active in political intrigue against the Government and attempts at revolu
tion than any other man in France. He was a soldier in the Franco-Prus
sian war and was wounded at Sedan. That proof of his patriotism has
always found him followers, whom he has ever been ready to lead in any
movement looking to disturbing the existing state of affairs. He was one of
General Boulanger's most active supporters, and on the condemnation of
that officer and Minister stood for a seat in the Chamber as a Boulangist and
was elected. He has more than once been a candidate for the presidency of
the Chamber, but without the full support of his own party. He was one
of the most prominent and violent of the opponents of revision in the Drey
fus case and it was when the excitement over the matter was at Its height
that he. with M. Marcel Habut and other members of the "Patriotic League,"
made the attempt to seduce General Roget from his duty and inaugurate a
revolution.
PARIS. Jan. 4.â When the High Court |
opened its public session to-day the Presl- j
dent of that body, M. Fallieres. read the
decisions which had been reached yester- I
day. The prisoners who were acquitted :
thereupon rose and shook hands with MM. |
Deroulede. Buffet and Guerin. Then, rais- j
Ing various shouts, they loft the hall. The j
court afterward entered on a secret ses
sion, during which it decided on the sen
tences of the convicted prisoners.
The court condemned MM. Buffet and j
Deroulede to ten years' banishment. i
M. Guerin was sentenced to ten years' !
confinement in a fortified place.
Marquis de Lur Saluces was sentenced
to ten years' banishment..
The Marquis, who is a well-known roy
alist and who was formerly a member of
the Chamber of Deputies, was convicted
in default of appearance. His whereabouts
is unknown, but it is believed that ho iÂ»
outside of French territory. He repre
sented the Glronde in the National As
sembly of 1871 and at one time he held the
rank of Chief of Battalion in the territo
rial army.
M. Deroulede. still weak from his ill
ness, entered the hall, leaning on M. Bar
illlwes 1 arm. Among the public were M.
Deroulede"s daughter and brother and
quite a number of women friends of the
prisoners.
After the reading of yesterday's decis
ions, M. Fallieres ordered the expulsion
of the men acquitted, and the Public
Prosecutor asked for the application of
sentences agrtinFt the convicted. M. Buf
fet's counsel. M. Normans, followed in
behalf of his client and began to expatiate
on the latter's sentiments, when M. Fal
lieres Btoppod him and told the lawyer
to keep to the question of the sentence.
"Well." said M. Normans, "strike my
client, po that the court may Judge the
extent of the hate and fear which ani
mates you."
M. Fallieres interrupted counsel, saying:
"You are insulting the court."
M. Normans rejoined: "M. Buffet leaves
this court greater than when he entered
it. and he will become greater still in
prison."
M. Buffet then said: "You have dealt
me a blow. Thank you. You have con
demned the Government twelve times and
I thank you twelve times. I do not want
to benefit by the Bcrenger law. If there
were street domonrtrations to-morrow I
would take part thorn. I do not
want pity or indulgence."
M. Deroulede then rose and Bald: "Slnco
you have coupled me with the valiant
royalist Buffet and the courageous antl-
Srmite duerin 1 will share their pain.
Hut. howevor hard may be the sentence,
however distant the exile, which Is even
more cruel for me, a patriot and a sol
dier, I will return. I will return when jus
tice returns. 1 shall be freo when the na
tion liccnmcs free. I am here by Loubet's
orders. Strike me, then. Accomplish the
act which will remain an indelible shame
on the history of the parliament. Vive
l'Armee NationaJe! Vive la Republique
dn Peuple!"
M. LH'roi;]fÂ»de was listened to in pro
found silence, but his passionate utter
anrt-s caused a great sensation.
M. Guerin gaid he did not wish to make
any further defense. He would not utter
a word of rt.'pentenee or appeal for in
dulgence, adding: "However hard my
trials and sufferings, I will say to my
friends 'Courage.' â¢Confidence.' 1 '
M. Deroulede rose again and said: "I
desire for the first time to shake hands
with these men. I met them here and
1 have learned to esteem them."
M. Deroulede then shook hands with
MM. nufff-t and Gu*>rin.
M. Buffet cried: "This is the first and
perhaps the last time."
M. Guerin said: "It is the first time
we are in agreement. "
M. Deroulode shouted, sarcastically:
"Yes, h^re Is the conspiracy."
The Fecret session then began and the
sentences were announced latfr.
There were a few cries of "Vivo Derou
lede:" and "Abas Loubct!" from the au
dience after the sentences were pro
nounced, but the demonstration was quite
insignificant. Although the anti-Somite
press is making a fuss over the outcome
tho tactics of the anti-Semites are shown
by the sensational caption "Murder of
Derouledo" in their afternoon organ. La
Cocarde, which secured a few purchasers
who were disgusted to find it only meant
what the Nationalists affect to consider
the legal murder of Deroulede.
To-day's decision condemns the con
victed men to pay the costs of the prose
cution. The sentences took effect im
mediately. It is asserted M. Deroulede
was hurried to the train and immediately

MONEY DUE FOR
CARE OF INSANE
Â¦
Suits Are Filed in Two
Test Cases.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JOSE, Jan. 4.â John F. Carrere,
secretary of the State Lunacy Com
mission, began probate proceedings in
four cases here to-day, which is but the
Initiatory of similar actions to be com
menced in every county in the State. Tho
proceedings are to force guardians of in
sane persons to pay for the charge of
their wards in the various State insane
asylums. There are thousands of dollars
due the State for the board of Insane pa
tients who have estates nmple to pay for
their care, and the commission has de
cided to collect It in each case.
The first proceedings begun in the Pro
bate Court here charge that Edward
O'Brien Is an incompetent and an inmate
of Agnews Asylum, where he has beeji
since the lGth of March, ISS3. Kate Far
rell was appointed guardian and is now
the qualified and acting guardian. Peti
tioner says that there is now due the
asylum the sum of $2000 for the care of
the Incompetent, and that the guardian
refuses to pay this and has neglected to
file or render an account. Petitioner
asks that Kate Farrell be cited to ap
pear and render an account and show
cause why the claim should not be paid.
Judge Ilyland issued the citation and
made it returnable January 12.
The second is in the case of James Otis
Nye, who has been an inmate of the
Stockton Asylum since June. ISSS. It is
claimed that 32070 Is due that institution
for his care. E. N. Parr Is Nye's guardian,
and he is cited to appear, file an account
and show cause why he should not pay
the claim.
The estate of Mary L. Ryder is another
that is requested to settle with the State.
Mrs. Ryder was committed to Agnews in
August. 1893. and $11S5 is due the State for
her support. John R. Norton is the
guardian, and he Is asked to render an
account for the past two years.
E. M. Ramer. guardian of Gertrude
Duffleld, Is another one cited to appear
and show cause why he should not pro
vide for his ward, whose estate is now in
debted to Agnews Asylum for $2000.
All these guardians are requested to ap
pear on January 12. Attorney General
Ford is the attorney for the petitioner.

Mirri Resigns.
ROME. Jan. 4.â Lieutenant General
Mirri. Minister of War, haa resigned In
consequence of attacks made upon him
bc-ca-JSA of h'.s efforts in IS9I to secure the
liberation of S'.gnor Palizzoto. member of
the Chamber of Deputies for Palermo, ac
cused of murdering Signor Notarbartolo.
former director of the Bank of Sicily, in
connection with the notorious bank frauds
case.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.-Xotwlthstand
ing many reports to the contrary, it can
authoritatively be said that there is no
change at the close of business to-night
in the antagonism existing between ship
pers of citrus fruits and the Initial roads,
the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe.
The determination of shippers to forward
cars, while not predicated upon unanim
ity as to expediency, was reached after
long deliberation based on legal advice.
This has resulted in the forwarding to-day
of less than sixty cars from all points in
Southern California. These cars are those
first loaded and tendered January 1, and
by long standing their contents would
have deteriorated In value by rot and con
finement. They were shipped direct to
such markets as had requested consign
ments.
These shipments were received by the
railroads at the old rate of 90 cents a box,
as they had full control of the routings.
In the face of the acceptance for ship
ments the rpad3 were served with a legal
protest as to a waiver of the right to
route the cars against the demands of the
shippers. While this seems like a victory
for the roads the shippers contend that
these shipments are to relieve a conges
tion and go direct to available markets,
and that the real issue will later be deter
mined.
"We have resumed shipments." said
President Naftzger of the Southern Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange to-nisht, "for the
reason that we have been forced to do so:
but we have made the shipments under
protest, and we do not waive any part of
our objection to the action of the compa
nies." The falling out between the ship
pers and the roads is not over by any
means, the fruit men say, and they de
clare that the trouble will, at an early
date, find Its way into the courts.
Telegrams by scores have been passing
between the railroad officials all day. and
it is stated that the railroads find the sit
uation worse for so doing under the na
ture of the protests that have been filed.
The full force of this Imbroglio will, it Is
asserted, be felt when the consignments
reach their destination and the condition
of the fruit is noted. Should the experi
ment of shipping in any old way. as tho
initial lines wish, prove that rot. freezing
and bad order should result, tho howl that
has been raised in the past few days will
only resemble a faint whistle as compared
to a cyclone roar.

FASTENING GUILT
ON MOLINEUX
Interesting Day in the
Poisoning Case.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â lnterest did not
lag for a moment to-day in the trial of
Roland B. Molineux for the murder of
Mrs. Katherine X Adams. Three of the
witnesses called gave testimony concern
ing the illness of Henry C. Barnet, who
died at the Knickerbocker Athletic Club
in tho fall of IS9S, and who, the prosecu
tion claims, was poisoned by cyanide of
mercury contained in Katnow powder.
Tho prosecution was also enabled to in
troduce the marriage certificate of Roland
B. Molineux and Blanche Cheseborough,
the alleged purpose of offering it being to
fix the age of Molineux. In one of the
letters asking for a patent medicine,
signed "H. C. Barnet," the writer gave
his age. It corresponded with that in the
certificate, but did not answer for Barnet.
A witness testified to-day as to the ef
fort by Molineux to have Cornish disci
plined by the Knickerbocker Athletic
Club, and a bank teller identified the poi
son package address and the "Barnet"
and "Cornish" letters as all written by
Molineux. All the testimony to-day
strengthened the prosecution's case, ex
cept that Barnet's attending physician,
while conceding that there had been mer
cury poisoning, insisted that the cause of
death was heart failure following diph
theria. He was asked:
"You have no doubt that Barnet's death
was due to diphtheria?" and replied: "I
am just as sure as I can be that Barnet's
death was due to diphtheria, with Bymp
toms of mercurial stomatitis."
Guy E. R. Ellison, chemist, testified that
he had reserved some of the mysterious
powder taken from the box in Barnet's
room, and was sent to his office for the
powder and for apparatus to analyze it.
He made a demonstration before the jury.
He placed a part of the powder in a test
tube and poured some muriatic acid on
top of it. The fumes of hydrocyanic acid
then rose in the air and the liquid became
perfectly white. Then the witness took
up a small phial of iodide of potash and
emptied it Into the test tube. The liquid
first turned orange, then gradually turned
darker and darker until it was bright red.
"This," said the wjtness, "la red mer
curic iodide."
Then the Recorder asked for thÂ© tube
and it was passed to him. He held it
aloft and looked through it. As the Re
corder Keld it the liquid changed. It be
came white at the bottom and turned
lighter at the top.
I^ater the white turned red like the rest
of the fluid, showing, tho witness said,
that mercury was present.
Charles C. Hughes, a member of the
Knickerbocker Club, testified that he had
repeated to Molineux a statement made
by Cornish that he (Molineux) had made
money by selling liquor in a disreputable
way.
"What did Molineux say?"
"He said It was an outrage and that an
employe should net bo allowed to mako
such statements."
Witness then told how Molineux com
plained to tho board of governors of the
club of Cornish slandering him and also
complained of the condition of the baths,
which were under Cornish's charge.
\\ hen Hughes left the stand and passed
around behind the jury-box Molineux
turned around in his seat and bowed and
smiled to him with a great show of cor
diality. Hughes returned the bow and
smiled at the defendant as he walked to
his seat among the spectators.
Joseph Farrell, a Newark policeman,
testified to meeting and speaking to
Molineux on December 21. IS9S, in Newark,
near the store of Hartgen & Co., where
the silver bottle-holder that contained the
poison received by Cornish is supposed to
have been purchased. ,
Gilbert B. Sayres, paying teller of the
National Shoo and leather Bank, was
positive in his identification of the poi
son package address, the admitted Moli
neux letters and the "Barnet" and "Cor
nish" letters, as having been written by
the same person. He had studied the
handwriting for two weeks, he said, and
began tho study believing Molineux in
nocent. '"I have to be very careful," said
the witness, "for the paying out of thou
sands of dollars rests on my judgment. I
have examined these writings and am
very sure that my opinion is correct. AH
the writings are very much alike. The
disguises are very transparent."
Court adjourned until to-morrow, when
It is expected that Joseph Koch, the let
ter-box man, will identify Molincux as his
patron.

JUDGMENT BY JUDGE BAHRS
GRAND LODGE BY-LAW HELD
TO BE VOID.
Superior Judge Bahrs handed down yes
terday a decision in the case of Louisa
Richter against the Supreme Lod^e
Knights of Pythias, which. If sustained
by the Supreme Court, establishes a pre
cedent that will bring comfort to the fam
ilies of many soldiers who have died for
their country on the field of battle.
Judge Bahrs has decided that Mrs. Rich
ter is entitled to recover $3090, the face of
an insurance policy on the life of her hus
band. Captain Reinhold Richter, who was
kiiled while in the service of the United
States army during an engagement be
tween the Spanish and American forces
near Manila. August 4, IS9S. The court
also holds that the provision of the by
laws of the order prohibiting service in
the array or navy during time of war was
Illegally enacted by the Knights of
Pythias in excess of its granted corporate
powers, and is absolutely void.
when Mrs. Kichter. after being denied
the insurance on her husband's life, filed
suit to recover, the order set up the sole
defense that in Joining the army Captain
Richter had forfeited his membership.
The plaintiff claimed that the law, which
was passed by the Supreme Lodge at
Cleveland, Ohio, September 1, 1596, was
ambiguous, uncertain and against public
policy, and was in excess of the cor
porate powers of the order.
The court sustained this contention
throughout, and holds that the defend
ant's right td exercise corporate powers
and functions was expressly limited by
Its charter, awarded by Congress, and any
attempted exercise of such powers and
functions beyond such limitation is void.
In rendering the decision the court said:
Prior to JunÂ« 29, 1534. the defendant had
been Incorporated on a number of occa
sions in the District of Columbia under
the general incorporation laws of that dis
trict enacted in mo. On that date, how
ever, to wit. June 23, 1594. the defendant
assumed its present corporate existence un
der a special enactment of the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United
States, which enactment Is tha charter of
the defendant, and It, together with such
general laws as have apntlcatlon. measure
the corporate powers of the defendant as a
corporate body politic.
This charter provides that various per

Who has not poured over the thrill

YOUNG LEON CLAYBURG
PUTS BURGLAR TO ROUT
MIDNIGHT VISITOR MAKES A
HASTY EXIT.
Servant's Carelessness Enables the
Thief to Gain an Entrance, but
He Gets No Plunder.
A burglar gained an entrance to the rÂ»s
idence of Simon Clayburg. 1916 Jackson
street, shortly before 1 o'clock yesterday
morning, but was discovered and put to
rout by young Leon Clayburg before he
had succeeded in securing any valuables.
Leon Clayburg. who is about 19 year 3
old. is a well built little chap, although
somewhat below the average height, and
possessed of the nerve ,of a veteran. He
had removed his clothing and was prepar-
JÂ°., rc Ji re when he heard a none in
the hall. Thinking his uncle had returned
home he stepped out to speak to him and
bumped into an uncouth looking stran*. r
The stranger did not stop to explain "hfs
presence, but made tracks for thÂ» rear
of the house with the boy in hot pursuit.
The burglar had prepared for emergen
cies by leaving the dining-room window
It will be seen that the corporate powers
granted are expressly limited to be exer
cised within the District of Columbia, and
had the National Legislature sought to en
large the powers beyond that such excess
would have been beyond Its powers as lim
ited by the constitution.
The conclusion that thÂ» corporate powers
of the defendant are limited to the District
of Columbia appears to be inevitable, but
as tending to obviate this conclusion the
defendant has cited "An act regulating
fraternal beneficial associations In the Dis
trict of Columbia." passed March J. 1537,
which provides in section 12: "That any
such association organized under the laws
of said district may provide for the meet
ings of lta legislative or (roveming body in
any State, country, province or territory
wherein Â»uch association shall have sub
ordinate bodies, and all business trans
acted at such meetings shall bÂ« valid in all
respects as If such meetings were held
within said district. â¢ â¢ â¢ . " Con
ceding the legality of said enactment as
being within the powers of Congress. It
nevertheless Is a fact that the defendant
was ,not organized under the laws of the
District of Columbia, but by Congressional
enactment, and therefore this provision
would seem to have no applfcation to the
defendant, and furthermore, the provision
being merely a furtHer grant of powers, the
same cannot have any retroactive effect,
and as the prohibitive law was paused be
fore the enactment of this statute, and as
the statute does n'&t even pretend to be
retroactive, no Invalid enactment nf any
law by the defendant beyond the scope of
Its powers previous to said further frrant of
powers has been cured. Therefore the pro
hibitive law of the defendant must be tested
and weighed by the law as it stood at the
time of Its adoption. As has been shown,
on the Ist day of September, 1856. the de
fendant's r!Â«ht to exercise corporate powers
and- functions was expressly limited by its
charter to the District of Columbia, and
any attempted exercise of such powers and
functions beyond such limitation is and was
ultra virea and void.
In conclusion the court ordered Judg
ment entered in favor of the plaintiff as
prayed.
Td keep the skin clean
is to wash the excretions
frcm it off; the skin takes
care of itself inside, if not
blocked outside.
. To wash it often and
clean, without doing any

quires a most gentle soap,
a soap with no free al-
kali in it.
Pears', the soap that

All sorts of stores sell it, especially

Hiller Allen Released.
Hiller Allen of Oakland, who was ar
rested in this city Wednesday on a war
rant sworn out by Arthur Williams, a
San Francisco tailor, charging him wi-h
paying for a stilt of clothes with a worth
less check, is once more free. Frlenda of
the young man came to the front when
they learned of his troubl* an.l squared

Allen claims he expected to have money

presented, but was disappointed.

then proceeded to make a hasty investi
gation to learn thÂ© extent of the burglar s
depredations. The unwelcome visitor niÂ»d
effected an entrance through a window

drawing-room left unfastened by the
Japanese servant. Nothing had been dis

bonds to the company, his sureties being

called upon Hawkins with his sureties
and placed J2OCO in gold on the counter,
asking Hawkins to hold it and give up the
bond, so as not to harass the sureties.
Hawkins retained the money but refused
to give up the bond, on the ground that
Devlin was Indebted to the company on
notes for machines he had sold to the ex

FROM the betting on the boxing bout
between Al Nelll and Jack O'Brien,
which will take place in the arena
at Woodward's Pavilion, to-night,
O'Brien will enter the ring a srror.g fa
vorite. A large volume of money flowed
into the strong box at "Harry" Corbeu's
yesterday, each of the rival middle
weights apparently having a strong fol
lowing. In the paris mutuels Neill made
a decided gain in popular favor yester
day. Where on Wednesday only a quar
ter of the number of tickets sold bore
his name yesterday this was changed
and he led O'Brien by a short margin.
The bettors apparently believe the bout
will last the limit, and that Neill will
get the decision. The least number of
tickets sold on each man -is on the first

THE BIG FIGHT TONIGHT
PULLED HAIR AND
SMASHED DISHES
mRS. FROXA EUNICE WAITE. a literary lady and 'the discoverer
of the California Venus, and Mrs. M. J. Single, a society lady from
the Interior, exchanged compliments at the Wentworth dinner ta
ble Wednesday evening, ar.d the result of this friendly greeting was
a lot of broken crockery and enough loose hair to make a "pompadour roll"
for a fashionable b*lle.
Those who witnessed the event were enthusiastic about the neatness and
dispatch with which the blows were delivered, and declared such great in
fighting ha/1 never before occurred between the soup and the fish.
Mrs. Walte and Mrs. Single raet at the table.
"You have been circulating malicious stories about me," said one of the
lady contestants.
"You lie!" said the other lady. Then the first lady struck out with her
lily white hand and smote the other lady. By this time the first lady haB
pulled out a handful of the other lady's hair, the other lady being en
gaged in the expensive pastime of smashing the boarding house china upon
her opponent's head.
It was at this interesting point that the women seated around the ta
bles began to faint and their male relatives, being forced to carry them from
the room, missed the exciting finish.
Neither Mrs. Wolte nor Mrs. Single were to be seen at the Wentworth
yesterday. Mr. Shaw, their landlord, had not the slightest idea where they
could be found, although he was positive they had left his boarding house.
"I sent Mrs. Waite notice through her gentleman friend that I did not
care to have her any longer as a boardtr and she left as soon as my mes
sage was delivered. Mrs. Single came to me and excitedly declared she
would not .remain under the same roof that sheltered Mrs. Waite and gave
me her keys. I made no protest and she also went her way." 'â¢â¢'?;-
The landlord of the Wentworth is ignorant of the details of the fistic
encounter at his dinner table. "All I know." he said, "is that the women
have for some time been gossiping about one another. There was a man
mixed up in it. I understand that matters came to a climax at the din
ner table. The He passed and then Mrs. Waite and Mrs. Single had a 'spat.'
I was not in the dining room at the time and so missed all the fun. That
is all I know about it."
There is only one unsatisfactory end to the interesting event. No one Is
able to state who came out victor. Popular opinion, though. Is in favor of
Mrs. Walte, who has the reputation of never having known a failure. Mrs.
Waite is a well known authoress and lecturer.. She has traveled through
out the United States delivering lectures, her theme being the California
wine industry. In addition to her other honors, Mrs. Waite occupies now
the responsible position of assistant to Varney Gaskill, secretary ;to the
California. Commission of the Paris Exposition.
personal friends. If it could be Judicially
established that Dr. Gardner is prevent
ing a sane man frnrn leaving the asylum
there would be samething on which tobase
a dismissal of th*Â» superintendent. A
ehort time ago an effort was made to get
Buchanan out of the asylum by means of
habeas corpus in the Superior Court o'
Napa. That court decided that the man
was insane and remanded him to the cus
tody of Dr. Gardner. A few days ago en
other effort was made to secure Buchan

No one need ever expect tnv
relief from an ill-firring truss. A
truss that does not f.t will cot do,
and we never sell a trus3 unless we
are satisfied that it will f.t the wearer.
Expert truss fitters have charge of
our miss room and they f.: evcrv
mtss accurately. Private room ;
men and women attendants.
Elastic Stockings
What we say of trusses holds
equally good about clastic stockings:
they must fit to be effective. Our
skilled fitters know how to measure
the limb to secure a perfect fit.
Experience has taught them exactly
what is necessary in every case. We
guarantee a fit, or money returned.

CLERK LEIGH IS ACCUSED
â¢
TBOUBLE OVEB SELECTION OF
COMMITTEES.
Bepresentative Haswell Charges That
in Selecting Names by Lot
Democrats Were
Favored.
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Jan. 4.â The Joint
legislative committees which sit in the
contests for Governor and Lieutenant
Governor were drawn by lot as pro
vided by law to-day. A lucky star pre
sided over the destinies of the Democrats,
as the drawing resulted in giving them
ten out of the eleven members of the
committee on the Governor's contest and
nine out of eleven on the Lieutenant Gov
ernor's contest. The committee to hear
the Governorship contests is as follows:
Senators Frazier, Allen and Crenshaw
and Representatives Hickman, Berry,
Finn, Rennick, Sledge, Lyon and Barton,
all Democrats, and Yarberry, Republican.
In the Lieutenant Governor's contest
the names drawn were Senators Harrell,
Coleman and Watson and Representa
tives Crawford, Alexander, Balrd, Bell,
Holland and Sharp, Democrats, and Rep
sentatives Reed and Lilly, Republicans.
The House members of these two com
mittees were sworn in to-night, and it is
probable that the joint committees will
organize and get down to work taking
evidence to-morrow.
In the drawing over the formation of
the legislative contested elections com
mittees the result was somewhat more
evenly divided. In the case of the two
Senatorial contests the Republicans got
only one member out of nine on each
committee, but in the House they got
majorities in ten out of the eighteen com
mittees which try contests. The Senate
completed its drawing at the morning ses
sion and the only incident connected with
it was when Senator Howard (.R.) ob
jected to Senator Goebel's name being
placed in the box. Senator Goebel rose
Irom his seat and said:
"Under the law the names of all Sen
ators present must be placed in the box,
but I beg to assure the Senator that if
ray name should be drawn out I of course
will not nerve."
The House was occupied until late in
the evening with the drawing of the legis
lative committees and there was nothing
noteworthy in the proceedings until after
the Governorship committee had been
announced and just before the drawing
for the committee on the Lieutenant
Governor's contest. Representative Has
well, leader of the Republican minority,
charged Chief Clerk Ed O. Leigh with
manipulating the ballots so as to give the
Democrats the advantage. Haswell and
Representative Berry, representing the
Republicans, stood at the clerk's desk as
the names of the members were placed in
the box and when the last name was
placed in it Haswell walked to his seat
and addressed the House, charging that
Leigh had in placing the names in the
box systematically thrown the names of
the Democratic members on the right
side of the box and likewise had thrown
the names of the Republicans to the left.
He said he did not know how It hap
pened that the Democrats got such a
majority on the Governor's contest com
mittee, drawn a few minutes before, but
he did know how the ballots had been put
In the box for the drawing now on and
he asked that the clerk at least be re
quired to shake the box thoroughly so
as to mix the names as contemplated by
law.
. Speaker Trimble Invited Haswell or any
other member to shake the box, but they
declined to do this, saying this was the
duty of the clerk. Mr. BÂ«rry (R.) asked
the Speaker to allow members to inspect
the box in order to verify the charges
made by him and Haswell, mentioning the
alleged manner in which the names had
been placed In the box, but Mr. Cantrill
ID.) said that the charges made by Has
well and Berry were serious and that as
long as they had waited until the draw
ing was practically complete he thought
they should be compelled to file them in
the proper way and not merely verbally
and personally as they were doing.
Speaker Trimble finally ordered the box
thoroughly shaken, and this was done
with the result that six Democrats and
two Republican names were drawn out.

Counterfeiters' Tools Found.
Special Dispatih to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 4.â Constable
George Apnew and Deputy Fish Commis
sioner Alfonso Miller added laurels to
their reputations as Chinese chasers by
the discovery yesterday of a collection
of counterfeiters' tools, which may prove
a very important clew to the source of
the false money which has been Impar
tially distributed over the county of late.
The officers were on their way from
Reeds Station to California City when
the find was made. The molds, six in
number, lay over an overhanging ledge
of rocks and did not show trace of recent
uso. It is surmised that a mysterious
stranger, who attracted some notice in
Tiburon a short time ago. is the man
by whom they were used. No other clew
is obtainable and no satisfactory expla
nation of their location has been pro
posed.

BLOODY COMBAT OF
YOUTHS IN A BARN
Quarreled Over Leadership of the
"Gang" and Settled Difficulties
With Their Fists.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 4.â Stripped to the
waist and covered with blood, Joseph
Reilly of "mascot" notoriety and Harry
Roberts, two tough youths of this place,
fought fifteen rounds yesterday after
noon, which, in point of savagery and
slugging, would have delighted the most
enthusiastic disciple of old-time John L.
pugilism.
The boys have been the terror of peace
able citizens for some time past. They
are the leaders of a collection of toughs
known as the "broad gauge gang," who
are suspected by the authorities of being
engaged In more than one window-break
ing escapade.
Two days ago a dispute arose over the
leadership of the band, and the two boys,
egged on by their followers, determined
to settle the difficulty with revolvers.
These weapons not being obtainable, fists
were selected as being the handiest.
"Greek" Martin, so called from his
Olympian tendencies, acted as referee
and timekeeper, and twenty young raga
muffins filled the barn where the diffi
culty was settled amid yells of delight.
Fifteen rounds were fought. Roberts
being terribly punished, but staggering
plucklly up at each call of time. In the
fifteenth round Reilly struck his oppo
nent a blow that broke his wrist, and
sobbing Roberts was conveyed home. The
boy's parents called in Dr. Wickman, who
soon set the Injured member. Constable
Agnew was notilied and hastened to the
scene, but owing to the tardiness of his
information arrived too late.
The affair has created a good deal of
unfavorable comment, and the parents of
Roberts will probably see k to have the
Reilly boy put under control.

Progress of the Case at
New York. .
Special Dispatch to Tne Call
NEW YORK. Jan. 4.â The examination
of the removal proceeding in the case of
William Green and the three Messrs. Gay
nor. indicted in Savannah, Ga,, for frauds
in connection with the Savannah harbor
and Cumberland Sound lmprovemtnts, in
charge of former Captain O. M. Carter,
was continued to-day before United States
Commissioner Shields. Abram J. Rose of
counsel for the accused contractors first
accepted the amended complaint and then
moved for the discharge of the accused
contractors. He conceded that his clients
were the persons charged in the Savannah
indictment, but he contended that that
paper did not prove probable cause, which
was the only other issue that could here
be raised in behalf of the prisoners. He
also argued that an indictment under the
existing statutes could not be considered
a court proceeding. He further said that
Captain Gillette, who testified yesterday,
had not and could not testify to the il
legal acts alleged to have been committed
by the contractors prior to July 20, IS9T,
when he took charge of the Savannah dis
trict.
Commissioner Shields overruled Mr.
Rose's motion and said that he did not
think that he had the right to certify to
the point raised, so that Mr. Rose could
present them to Judge Brown of the
United States District Court, and an
opinion be obtained. Mr. Rose said that
his witnesses at present were in other
States, and he asKed for a two weeks'
adjournment so as to get his witnesses
and the necessary papers. The Assistant
District Attorney said that Mr. Rose was
simply fighting for time, so that, as far
as the charge of conspiracy is concerned.
It will be outlawed by the statute of limi
tations.
United States District Attorney Irwln
of Savannah also opposed further delay,
because Mr. Rose had not suggested the
line of evidence he proposed to introduce
In behalf of his clients. He further stated
that under the statute of limitations the
conspiracy charge would expire by July
of this year.
Commissioner Shields said the defend
ants were entitled to adjournment and by
agreement of all the counsel interested
the case was continued until January 16.
In the meantime the arguments on the
appeal of former Captain Carter will have
been made by Mr. Rose and Mr. Burnett
in the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals in this city.

MISFORTUNES OF MRS. GROSS.
Loses Her Husband and Son Within
a Month.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 4.â Mrs. C.
Gross, widow of the late Cornelius Gross,
a well-known citizen who died one month
ago to-day, received a telegram this
morning that her son was killed near
Knoxville, Napa County. The young man
worked in the Manhattan quicksilver
mines there. The accident is supposed to
have been caused by an explosion. Gross
was 30 years of age, unmarried and the
main support of his mother. A sister Is
lying critically ill with typhoid fever. The
remains are expected on Saturday even
ing's train.
leprosy presented himself, would not the
House have power to keep him out?"
Mr. Schroeder said Roberts had ad
mitted his relationship with his plural
wives. He had publicly said he would be
' if he would give up his wives." This
was an offense against public morals
as against the law, and Mr. Roberts
should be excluded from a seat.
At this point a recess was taken until
2 o clock.
Tiiu afternoon hearing was enlivened
when Senator Rawlins of Utah was
drawn into a discussion of polygamy. Mr.
Schroeder had continued his argument,
when Mr. Rawlins interrupted to correct
the detail as to when certain statements
were given before a Congressional ecrtn
mittee relative to polygamy. Chairman
Javier thereupon asked Mr. Rawlins, who
was one- a delegate from Utah, if it was
not understood at the time the State was
admittfd that polygamy was at an end.
"It was my understanding," said Mr.
Rawlins. "that the solemnization of
polygamous marriages was interdicted by
the Mormon church, and this would have
a salutary effect in terminating the prac
tice. But I did not hold out to Congress
that family relations already established
would be broken up."
Mr. Tayler asked if it was expected that
the law against polygamy would be vio
lated.
Rawlins answered that it was thought
there might be sporadic cases, but as n
general system polygamous relations
would gradually terminate. "Do you
think," continued Tayler, "that Utah
would have been admitted if it had been
understood that in a few years she would
send to Congress a man maintaining po
lygamous relations?"
Rawlins said he did not think Congress
believed the practice of polygamy would
be continued. The course of events in
recent years had clearly shown that the
practice would end in time.
"Did you not believe and state at the
time," asked Tayler, "that the polyga
mous system was dead and burled?"
Rawlins did not recall such statements.
Tayler read from the speeches of Raw
lins of those days to the effect that while
polygamy had only extEted, the world
was progressing and that the discussion
was becoming "ancient history."
Roberts here asked to- put a question
to Senator Rawlins, and asked: "I will
ask the Senator if he thinks Congress un
derstood at the time Utah was admitted
that the President of the United States
would appoint in Federal offices in the
State of Utah men practicing polygamy?"
There v.-as some question as to whether
Rawlins should answer the question. He
finally proceeded, saying that for years
polygamy had prevniled in Utah. Under
It many people had established strong
conjugal relations and ties. But the
proclamation of the Mormon church for
bidding further polygamous marriages
had given general satisfaction, and it was
commonly accepted that the practice
would come to an end. Schroeder con
cluded his argument as to the historical
aspect of polygamy and the law In the
case.
Mrs. J. Ellen Foster addressed the com
mittee in behalf of the great number of
women Interested In the case and who
were not represented before the commit
tee. She spoke vigorously, dealing with
the Roberts case and the general moral
interests it Involved. This concluded the
day's proceedings and the committee ad
journed until 10:30 o'clock.
ROBERTS CASE
IS REOPENED
Sessions of Committee
Resumed.
ARGUMENTS ARE OFFERED
DEFENDANT WILL CLOSE IN
HIS OWN BEHALF.
I>eclares He Will Show That Wit
nesses Who Appeared Against
Him Are Entirely Un
reliable.
WASHINGTON', Jan. 4.â The Roberts
investigating committee resumed its ses
sions to-day for the purpose of hearing
arguments and bringing the inquiry to an
early conclusion. It was expected that
ex-Secretary John G. Carlisle would be
present to sum up the case against Mr.
Roberts, and that Mr. Roberts personally
would make the argument in his own be
half. Word came from Mr. Carlisle, how
ever, that he had not understood his per
sonal presence was desired, but he was
ready to submit written arguments on any
of the questions Involved.
Chairman Tayler stated that the state
ment of a witness absent in Utah had
been received, but as Mr. Roberts declined
to admit It in an Informal manner the
matter would have to be taken up later.
Mr. Roberts said he wished to present
matter tending to show the untrustwor
thlness of witnesses appearing against
him. It included a published card signed
by Thomas J. Brandon, disclaiming hav
ing given out certain information relative
to Roberta; also court records, in which
Roy Brandon was a party. Mr. Roberts
also offered a telegram from the proprie
tors of the Salt Lake Herald, concerning
the testimony of Mr. McDaniels. Tayler
excluded the telegram, however, saying
there was no color of right or propriety
In receiving a telegram as testimony, in
view of Mr. Roberts' refusal to admit the
statement of the absent I." tab. witnesses.
Mr. Schroeder, head of the Gentile dele
gation here to oppose Roberts, then
opened the argument against Roberts.
The argument \wls largely technical and
was divided under three heads, viz.: First,
whether or not the member-elect has the
constitutional qualifications, including cit
izenship; second, whether or not the con

ASSURANCES OF PROSPERITY.
\ 7 ITU tne rams of the new year come renewed
\A/ asfjranccs of good crops. From all parts of
the State reports are sent in of a sanguine feel
ing notable among all classes of people. It is not the
farmer only who is' animated by it. Bankers and
merchants and manufacturers share the hopes excited
by the prospects of coming good, snd accordingly
there is cheerfulness in even- line of industry.
The rains of the season have now sufficed to satisfy
the absorbing power of the soil, and the streams are
beginning to fill up and flow with strong currents.
In some localities there has been something of a tor
rential flow already noted, but no fear is felt of dan
gerous floods. The swift rushing away of the water
will have the effect of reminding intelligent men once
more of the importance of devising a comprehensive
system of storing flood' waters, and to that extent
will serve a good purpose as a valuable object lesson
in a problem which concerns the welfare of the whole
From Santa Clara the reports announce that the
creeks are booming, but no danger is anticipated, as
precautions against floods have been taken in the
past. The dispatches add: "The ground now is thor
oughly soaked and there is general jubilation among
farmers and business men. The prospects for a pros
perous year were never more encouraging. Tree
planting will be far in excess of last year, the dealers
reporting unusually heavy yales. Many building im
provements are in contemplation, the banks have so
much money that they are refusing savings deposits,
and the merchants are doing a remarkable business
for this time of the year."
Similar reports come from other sections. From
Fresno comes the statement: "Agricultural prospects
have never been more promising. The rain has soake<i
well into the ground and is doing nothing but good."
Statements from San Joaquin are to the effect that th;
gops are expected to be the heaviest in years, while
from Monterey, where the farmers in some sections
have had such bad seasons in the past, comes the
checiing announcement: "In the southern portion of
the county, where it was most essential that rain
should fall within a short time or else do great dam
age to growing crops, there has been nearly an inch.
The early rains in the south induced the farmers there,
to put in a large acreage to grain, further rains caused
the grain to sprout, but for the last two weeks warm
winds retarded the growth considerably and crops
were in danger. The present storm insures the crops
of Monterey County."
Out of these assurances of prosperity there will
come of course a new spirit of enterprise among Â»he
people, and the year will doubtless prove one of the
mo?t notable in our industrial history. In the mean
time the lesson of the season should not be lost. If
we had a good system of storing flood waters which
arc now running to waste the copious rains would
assure us pood crops not for one season only, but for
another, even should it prove to be a dry year.

The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever valuÂ» they may
. have as communications of general Interest.
Editor The Call: The undersigned, with
a heart overflowing with emotion, desires
to return his profound thanks to the Hon.
James Duval Phelan, the Mayor of this
city, for following the suggestions made
by him in The Call's Issue of December
29 last and picking at least fourteen
names from the list of thirty-three sub
mitted to his consideration for appoint
ment on the spur of the moment. The
undersigned fancies and has reason to be
lieve that had he presented the- list to
his Honor In person a still larger selec
tion would have been made from it, how
large the Lord In his Infinite wisdom alone
knows. The undersigned acted In perfect
good faith and with but one Idea, to sub
serve the best interests of the city. He
knew that it would be Impossible for his
Honor to accomplish the task alone, a
task which would have taxed the robust
constitution of a Hercules or Atlas to the
utmost, and the Mayor Is far from pos
sessing the constitution of either, and at
the last moment he jumped In and offered
such humble advice as it was in hie power
to give and is glad to be informed that
his Honor appreciated It and acted upon
many of the suggestions tendered him In
a spirit of profound abnegation.
In order to test the public pulse the un
dersigned on Tuesday last visited the
famous Iconoclast, Gavin McNab, the
great Democratic Douglas, in his den at
the Mills building and found him like
">?iobe, all tears," surrounded by his
crestfallen and lamenting satellites. Con
spicuous among the disconsolate was
Sammy Braunhart, the isinglass ticket
man and famous navigator of the water
front.-,
Wrapped in a buggy robe, such as he
once presented Mr. Clnclnnatus Aristides
Buckley, the Sage of Livermore.as a token
of his affection, he declared that a refusal
on the part of Mayor Phelan to appoint him
Commissioner of Public Works marked
the rock upon which the great party is
bound to split. But we, who are philoso
phers, merely laugh at his pretensions
and believe with the illustrious Junius
that these Idle vaporlngs are but "the
gloomy companions of a disturbed imagi
nation, the melancholy madness" of
poetry without the inspiration. Colonel
Maximilian Parkhurst Popper, the fa
mous street-sweeping contractor, was
there fiercely stroking his mustache,
which he always does when In anger, but
saying as little as an Iroquois chief usu
ally says. Colonel Henry L. Bienfleld, the
celebrated Keyhole Detective of the Re
formers, who used to carry Primaries for
Mr. Buckley by transporting legitimate
voters in vegetable wagons from one dis
trict to another, thought that the end of
the world was near at hand,
Gavin McNab himself, the modern Ma
chlavelli from the land o' cakes, looked
like Napoleon upon the evening of Water
loo; like Rachel he refused to be comfort
ed, because his push was not, an<l all he
condescended to say was that it was a
fight between the people from South of
tile Slot and the great social clubs, such
as the Paciilc-Union, Bohemian and Uni
versity, and the clubs won, which has all
the appearance of thruth, for upon con
sulting our latest Society Blue Book we
find that the
Pacific-Union Club has received seven
appointments.
Bohemian Club has received six appoint
ments.
University Club haa received six ap
pointments.
Burlingame Country Club has received
two appointments.
San Francisco Art Association has re
ceived two appointments.
San Francisco Veretn has received one
appointment.
Century Club has received one appoint
ment.
Laurel Hill Club has received one aD
polntment.
St. Andrew's Society has received one
appointment.
Twenty-seven appointments out of a
possible thirty-three is not a bad begin
ning, and our heartfelt and sincere con
gratulations are due to these clubs for the
bloodless victory. The undersigned, who
Is a Democrat of the most pronounced
type, one who always speaks of the party
of Jefferson and Jackson with the same
affection with which Claude Melnotte
spoko of his beloved Pauline Deschap
pelles, feels in duty bound to congratu
late his Honor, the Mayor, upon three or
four appointments peculiarly appropriate.
Conspicuous among these Is that of
James Penman, familiarly known as
"Golden Jubilee Denman," to the position
of a member of the Board of Education.
Of course, Mr. Denman, like several oth
ers who received appointments, supported
neither Mr. Bryan nor Judge Maguire,
but a little thing like that don't go a long
way with the Mayor.

was but the insignificant Pueblo of Yerba
Bue^na, when Mayors were still Alcaldes,
solid nines nothing but common regi
dores, and when the dark-eyed senorltas
of Castile and Andalusia eagerly listened
from the overhanging balconies of un
couth adobe dwellings to the protesta
tions of eternal devotion falling from the
lips of the gallant cavaliers of old Spain.
James Denman was a constant and never
failing guest at the public banqueting
table, and with slight variations he has
been there ever since. Of him it might be
said that he was like the poor we have him
always with us. In sickness and in health,
in success and adversity, he has been our
steady boarder, and promises to remain
6uch until the end of his appointed time.
Xot less appropriate is the appointment
of John "Barkis" Casserly, a member of
the famous Burllngame Country Club, to
be one of the Board of Education, for the
good people who live south of the slot
have long declared that their children
would never amount to much In this world
unless they could play polo and lawn !
tennis, and Mr. Casserly has kindly.'
promised to introduce both of these ac
complishments into the public schools.
Not a few people find fault with the
appointment of a man who years ago
filled an elective office in this city and
who had come . to regard all duplicate
taxes and taxea paid under protest as the
personal perquisites of his offlce. so much
bo that the Grand Jury was compelled to
convince him of his error. His Honor,
being a very busy man, has probably not
heard of what has long been an "open
secret, and attention Is not called to it. in
the hope that future appointments of this
kind may be averted, but Just to remind
some people that to be a reformer one
need not necessarily be an angel.
The thousands and tens of thousands
of people who live south of the slot de
sire to repudiate the slander circulated
about town by disappointed Job chasers
that his Honor has given them the over
look, for they have received the appoint
ment of one Park Commissioner out of
the thirty-three appointments, and they
are absolutely satisfied and glad to have
received so much.
The malicious suggestion that the slate
presented by his Honor on Sunday morn
ing last has put the kibosh on certain
Senatorial aspirations is one that needs j
no answer at the present, for he has
made it a rule of his life never to cross a
stream until he comes to it.
The undersigned in conclusion desires
once more to thank his Honor for listen
ing so kindly to his suggestions made at
the last moment, and he freely adver
tises the. fact that he Â¦will be ready to
submit another and similar list one year'
hence, when the official life of those "who i
have drawn the short terms in his i
Honor's lottery shall have come to an
end. Respectfully submitted.

THE TELEPHONE ORDINANCE.
f-^vROCEEDINGS of the.Board of Supervisors on
L>/ Wednesday show how well advised was the
* counsel of' The Call urging the Supervisors to
have an amended resolution imposing a tax upon
telephone machines ready to be taken up in case the
Mayor did not fulfill his promise to submit one
The Mayor's resolution was submitted, but proved
B^efe^ive. inasmuch as it did not specify the
amount of the tax to be imposed, and when the defect
was called to his attention he suggested that the mat
ter be referred to the City Attorney. That course
would have entailed a further delay, which is just what
the telephone corporation wishes. What The Call
foresaw came to pass, and it is fortunate that precau
tions had been taken. Supervisor Aigeltinger had a
resolution prepared against which no legal objection
can be found, and it was promptly taken up and
The iÂ«ne of the paÂ«age of the ordinance now rests
with the incoming board. The telephone company
has to th3t extent succeeded in its efforts to defeat the
measure. The present board can do no more than
h: has 'done. The matter, however, is leit in good
shapt for the interests of the city, and it is not likely
the new board will permit any further delay in enact-

the des'red connection will go far toward put
ting an end to one of the grossest abuses which the
companies have practiced upon the public through
their n:ckel-in-the-Â«lot machines. The passage of that
resolution leaves the issue in the hands of the Mayor,
and it needs but his signature to become a law.
Another commendable action of the board was the
turntable ordinance, which was opposed by all the
strength of the Market Street Railway Company. By
this ordinance San Francisco will be rid of what is
worse than a nuisance, for the turntables have been
sources of denger to the public as well as of annoy
ance.
When the board meets to-day to close up its offi
cial business it can look back upon a record of good
work faithfully performed. It has been the best body
of Supervisors San Francisco has known for many a
year, and closes the history of our municipal govern
ment under the consolidation act with a page which
the people can read with satisfaction. In not one m
stance has this board broken the pledges made to the
voters during the campaign. It has set an example
which the incoming board will do well to follow in
the work that lies before them.
TAXATION OF LOCAL BONDS.
BY the vote of the people in favor of issuing
bonds for extensive municipal improvements
a new interest is given to the proposed amend
ment to the constitution providing that "all bonds
hereafter issued "by "the State of California, or by any
county, city and county, municipal corporation or
district, including school, reclamation and irrigation
districts, within said State shall be free and exempt
from taxation."
As the law stands the bonds about to be issued by
the city will be virtually unsalable in California.
They are to bear rates of interest so low that if sub
jected to State and county taxes they would not yield
to the purchaser an interest sufficient to justify buy
ing them at par value. One series of the bonds will
pay three and a half per cent interest, and the other
only three per cent. Even the highest of these will
not net the holder more than two per cent under the
lightest State and county tax levy likely to occur.
Such being the condition of affairs it is well assured
that unless the practice of taxing be stopped all of
our bonds issued for State or local improvements will
have to be sold to capitalists in the East or in Europe.
That will entail the sending of interest money out of
the State every year when it might just as well be re
tained at home. Upon the bonds to be issued by this
city the yearly interest will amount in round numbers
to $183,500. That sura is in itself considerable, and
when to it is added the interest on all other State,
county, city and district bonds sold outside the State
it will be seen that the drain of money from the com
munity will be a serious evil.
There is no way by which a Government can gain
anything by taxing its own bonds. The tax always
rlTect? the market value of the bond, and no bond that
is subject to taxation can be sold as profitably as one
that is untaxed. It is thus impossible for a commun
ity to increase its wealth by such forms of taxation,
since what it gains in revenue in that way it has to
pay out in increased interest rates or sacrifice by sell
it:g bonds below par.
In our case we not only gain nothing but lose
heavily by the folly of such taxation. It is therefore
manifestly to the interest of the State and of all its
citizens to amend the constitution so as to put an end
to the lolly. The vote upon the issue does not take
place until November, but it is none too early for
voters to give the subject earnest consideration.
Later in the year the Presidential campaign will bring
forward a host of excitements to distract attention
from local and non-partisan questions, and for that
reason the people should make up their minds on
this subject now.

THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION AGAIN
Iâ;I â ; ORECASTS of the prospective work of Con-
I gress invariably include in the list of subjects
certain to occupy attention a bill for the im
provement of our immigration laws. It has been so
with each gathering of Congress for many years past.
There have been times when the matter was deemed
of such importance that it was spoken of as "a burn
ing issue." However, nothing ever came of it but
smoke, and so we have the same old question to dis
cuss aeain.
During the years of the industrial depression the
problem came very near solving itself. Compara
tively few immigrants came into the country while
the hard times lasted, and some sanguine folks came
to the conclusion there would never be much of a
rush again. With the return of better times there has
come an increase in the number of Europeans who
wish to share in our prosperity, and consequently the
immigration issue is now as portentous as it was ever
at any period of our history.
The recent report of the Commissioner of Immi
gration at New York, the point at which 86 per cent
of the immigrants land, shows that during the month
of November there were admitted at that port 4133
cabin passengers and 26,460 steerage passengers, a
total of 30,593. In previous Novembers there were
admitted immigrants as follows: 1895, 16,881; 1896,
11.283; 1897, 12,174; 1898. 18.189. It is. said the rate
of immigration in the fall affords a safe basis upon
which to estimate the rate for the coming year, and
the conclusion is therefore drawn that in the year be
fore us a veritable army of immigrants will seek work,
wages and homes in this country.
The immigration from Southern and Eastern Eu
rope, which was so notable just before the panic
years, has begun again on an extensive scale. It is
said that almost the entire increase in the immigra
tion of 1899 over that of the preceding year is from
Austria-Hungary and Italy. The Austrian's coming
are from the southern and eastern parts of that coun
try â from Croatia. Kraine and Dalmatia â and other
immigrants are heading this way from Bosnia, Herze
govina and Montenegro.
These immigrants are of races quite distinct from
that which formed our government and established
our institutions. They are aliens in everything. Their
arrival in such numbers as are likely to come in dur
! ing the year will menace the welfare of the communi
ties where they settle. They will tend to lower the
j wage rate, depress the standard of living, and encour
i age class antagonisms. It is certainly imperative that
some restriction be put upon their coming. The is
sue is therefore revived again in all its force, and this
j time it is to be hoped Congress will do something lo
I check the evil.

THE CHICAGO DRAINAGE CANAL.
r^ HICAGO has accomplished her great enter
l prise of providing a drainage from her sewers
southward through a canal to the Dcs Plaines
River, thence to the Illinois and thence to the Mis
sissippi. The canal has been made of proportions
ample for commerce as soon as the upper rivers can
be prepared to receive and transmit it. The traffic
will have to wait for appropriations for the improve
ment of the rivers. In the meantime the sewage will
flow on and perhaps will raise a stench that will com
pel people living along the streams to make the im
provements at their own expense.
In this undertaking Chicago has had a strong and
determined opposition from the start. The sewage of
the city is to pass through rivers whose waters have
been pure and healthful and is to be dumped into the
Mississippi just above St. Louis. The magnitude of
the work is such that since its completion it ranks
as the largest artificial canal in the world. Credit
must be given to Chicago for devising so vast a
project and carrying it to success in the face of such
antagonism. It remains to be seen, however, whether
it will be. expedient to permit her to make use of it as
a drain for her sewers.
The lands along the Dcs Plaines and the Illinois
rivers are comparatively flat. Water does not flow
rapidly down the streams, and the danger of con
tamination from the sewage is therefore great. In the
long, hot summers of the Mississippi Valley, it will
not take much in the way of sewer stuff lodged along
the banks of the rivers to spread disease over a wide
area of country. It is the fear of that result which
aroused hostility to the project when first mooted,
and it was for the purpose of allaying that hostility
that the promoters of the enterprise changed it from
a mere sewer drain to a great canal fitted for com
mercial uses.
It is said efforts will be made to prevent the use of
the canal as a sewer. If so an interesting question will
be raised and the decision upon it will be of far
reaching importance. In Great Britain the peopl
long ago had to deal with the evil of dumping
sewage into rivers, and the upper courses of rivers in
that country are now protected from such contami
nation. Sooner or later the United States will have
to make similar regulations. As cities increase along
the banks of streams the dangers of permitting the un
restricted emptying of sewers into them will increase.
It will then be in many parts of this country, as in
the manufacturing districts of Great Britain, that the
sewage will be so vast in bulk as to poison the waters
sufficiently to kill the fish and impregnate the air with
germs of disease. A controversy over the Chicago
canal will 'bring that problem up for consideration,
and it is probable no harm would be done to Chi
cago, while an immense benefit would be conferred
on the country at large, if the decision be reached
that she cannot use it for sewer drainage or any pur
pose that will materially injure the waters of the Dcs
Plaines or the Illinois rivers.

ture; Dr. Victor A. Norgaard of the Bureau
of Animal Industry; Mr. F. H. Brandenburg
of the Weather Bureau. The hope of securing Sec
retary James Wilson has not been entirely aban
! doned.
The industry represented by the association is one
of the greatest" in the Union, and, moreover, is one
in which the Western States are particularly inter
ested. The proceedings of the convention will there
fore be watched with close attention throughout a
wide region of the country. The livestock men, like
other producers, are now deeply concerned in ques
tions of markets, and the discussions will undoubt
edly be directed" largely to such considerations.
Notice is given in the preliminary report of the
committee on arrangements that a movement will be
made to get the Department of Agriculture to create
a bureau for giving public information of the produc
tion and shipping of livestock. The argument of the
supporters of the movement is that the agricultural
interests of the country are amply provided for in this
direction, so that the amount of wheat, corn, oats,
etc., is approximately known months before the har
vest. The exports, visible supply and consumption
are reported daily, through agents of the Department
of Agriculture, located in every State. This system
tends to regulate the markets and prevents, for any
length of time, a manipulation of prices. The live
stock industry does not enjoy any advantages of this
character, and it is now impossible to tell with any de
gree of certainty the number of livestock in each
State each year, the weather or sanitary conditions of
the various stock-growing districts, or anything about
the supply, consumption or exportation other than
private individuals or corporations may see fit to give
out. This lack of reliable information is to the dis
advantage of the consumer, and makes it an easy mat
ter for combinations to manipulate prices.
The time of the delegates is not to be devoted
wholly to business. The hospitality of Texas has ar
ranged a round of festivities for the entertainment of
the visitors, and the convention will prove to be both
pleasant and profitable to all who attend it.

6THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 5, 1900.
7
OLD San Francisco's Fire Depart
ment celebrated its finish last night
at a feast given In the Maple Room
of the Palace Hotel. The men who
will fight the flames for new San
Francisco will soon replace the old boys.
The evolution of the city carries with it
reorganization of all Its departments and
many of the firemen of to-day expect to
Etep down and out when the changes
comÂ© about.
Last night's affair was a reunion of the
firemen, a parting celebration and a mark
of appreciation by the citizens of the city
for work well performed, all rolled into
one. It was an occasion that will be
memorable in the city's history Â»nd will
be written on its brightest pages. It was
not alone a feast and a Jollification, but
it was a time for showing the brave men
who have risked their lives for the city
that their work has been appreciated and
that the citizens are not unmindful of
their services.
It was a passing of the old. It was a
welcome to the new.
The incident around which all the minor
details of tho affair revolve was the pres
entation to Chief Sullivan of a beautiful
token of affection from the men who have
fought with him and under his directions.
In a handsome morocco-covered volume,
embossed and trimmed with gold, wera
engrossed the following resolutions:
Whereas. In accordance with thÂ« pro
visions of the new charter the San Fran
cisco Fire Department Is about to t>Â« re
organized and conducted as a permanent
system, and whereas, through such reor
ganization some of our members are likely
to retire from the department, thereby
severing the pleasant relations of comrade
ship which we have po long enjoyed, we,
therefore, as officers and members of the
San Francisco Fire Department, in timely
anticipation of the proposed change In its
system do gladly avail ourselves of the op
portur.lty of formally expressing the es
teem in which we hold our distinguished
chief. Dennis T. Sullivan, who for over
twenty-one yoars, and while advancing suc
cessively according to his merits through
each and every grade of our service, hns
discharged his duties with honor to him
self and to the protection and benefit ot our
municipality, be it therefore
Resolved. That Chief Engineer Dennis T.
Sullivan (as the Immediate successor of that
brave veteran soldier and fireman, the late
David Scannell) by his ability, real and en
ergy has co effectively improved and mod
ernized the San Francisco Fire Department
that It stands to-day unexcelled by any in
stitution of like character in thÂ« united
â¢Â» Resolved, That as the splendid organ**
SAW THEIR FINISH
AT A FEAST
they did so 'he would not attend the af
fair. As a consequence the testimonial
was a secret that the men guarded to the
end.
The banquet began at 8 o'clock. Tables
were eet for two hundred firemen and
their iruests and there was not a vacant
place. All the commercial and Industrial
Interests of the city were represented.
Officials of old San Francisco and the offi
cers of the new municipality were there.
And a hundred firemen â the heads of tho
department, chiefs of battalions, captains
of engine companies, captains of truck
companies and captains of chemical com
paniesâwere the hosts.
After the guests had entered the Maple
Room and had been assigned their places
around the festal board, the heroes of a
hundred hard-fought and desperate bat
tles against the dreaded element marched
In tn single file. Their appearance was the
signal for the first outburst of applause,
so hearty and so warm that the men
could not mistake Its meaning.
When the firemen took thalr places
around the tables and faced Chief Sulll-
Two hours mttea away as though they
were hardly as many minutes In the pleas
ant pastime of entertaining the inner man.
The "small blacks" and the cigars were
the cue for Garret McEnerney, who had
been selected to act as toastnmster, to
prepare for the "feast of reason."
Appreciative of the honor conferred, Mr.
McEnerney took occasion to extend his
thanks to the department to which the
Zens Is that of 'Our Country/ "
Every man arose to his feet, and with
glasses held high above their heads
cheered for the land they love so well
and the flag they honor. The orchestra
played the national hymn and every voice
Joined in the chorus. M. H. de Young
was Introduced to respond to the toast.
Briefly he said:
"This Is a broad subjectâ one upon
which a man of learning could talk for
hours. Our country! Its influence is felt
over the entire civilized world. How great
it has grown! How great it is!"
The speaker referred with considerable
pride to the country's educational su
periority over every nation , on the globe.
He touched briefly on the Maine disaster
and its results, and argued in favor of the
expansion policy of the President.
"Ours is the greatest nation on the face
of the globe," he continued, "and the one
with the best form of government. Now,
as a member of the press and in Its be
half and on behalf of the peo
ple of San Francisco, I de
sire to congratulate the city on its Fire
Department and the magnificent leader It
â¢has in Chief Sullivan."
that he could not say anything too good
about the firemen, their efficiency and
f?Jthfulness.
W. J. Dutton, representing the Fire Un
derwriters, told of the high appreciation
in which the department is held t>y the in
surance companies.
Following this was the presentation to
Chief Sullivan of the souvenir from his
men.
Mayor Phelan, who was unable to at
tend the banquet, sent the following let
ter of regrets:
"D. T. Sullivan, Chief of the Fire De
partment: I regret that domestic affairs
keep me from participating in the ban
quet tendered to the friends of the FirÂ©
Department this evening, but I desire to
take the opportunity of expressing tho
confidence with which I am sure the peo
ple of San Francisco regard you so far as
your office is concerned, and to say that
I share fully their admiration of the in
telligent, tireless and heroic work per
formed by you and your men.
"Under the new order of things I am
satisfied the same high standard of effi
ciency which you have established and
maintained will be preserved. Please ac
cept for yourself and colleagues my cor
dial regards and best wishes for the New
Year. JAMES D. PHELAN."
During the evening the following pro
gramme was renderea by a string orches
tra:
March, "Folles Bergere" (LJncke); se
lection from the opera "Carmen" (Bizet);
"Habana Clgarieres" (Cervaslo); selec

This sentiment was re-echoed with a
will and for a moment the modest Chief
was almost forced to say something in
acknowledgment of the applause that
greeted the mention of his name.
"Dear old California must not be for
gotten," announced the toastmaster at
the conclusion of Mr. de Young's remarks.
"We love our country, but there Is still
something about our own Golden State
that makes her more than dear to us."
Dr. E. E. Taylor responded. He re
viewed the history of the State, spoke
of its great resources and finished his
address by a eulogy on the men who had
run with the old "masheen" in the early
days.
Colin M. Boyd spoke of old San Fran
cisco and M. H. Hecht responded to new
San Francisco. Both agreed that it was
a matter of congratulation not only to
the city but to the State that the metro
polis of the West had taken a step for
ward.
It was the good fortune of F. W. Dohr
mann to throw well-earned and deserved
verbal bouquets at " 'Frisco's tire light
ers." Frequent outbursts of applau.se in
terrupted tho speaker at every passage
In his address that savored of a compli
ment to the Fire Department. He stated
city owed so much. He said that mere
words could not repay the brave men for
the work they had done, but that they
would have to consider themselves poorly
recompensed with the knowledge that
every man, woman and child In San
Francisco appreciated their services.
"I will not take up your time now with
a long talk," said the toastmaster. "My
duty here is to call off the programme.
The most- appropriate toast that can be
proposed where there are congregated
around the banquet table American citl-
van. who occupied the spat of honor, they
saluted their commanding officer, and First
Assistant Dougherty, his voice trembling
with emotion, wished Chief Sullivan suc
cess In whatever his future undertakings
might be, and expressed the hope that
fortune would favor him during 1900.
Cheers that resounded through the big
hotel followed the greeting. There was
more applause for the firemen and then
three cheers and a tiger for their Chief.
For the next hour and a half the gather
ing discussed the menu. Course after
course was disposed of as easily as the
firemen have disposed of many a blaze
that has threatened the city. Old comrades
chatted between dishes, and newly made
friends sipped wine and wished each
other health as they stole time to take a
breath. Here is the list of the good things
that made the crowd feel jolly:
Eaatern Oysters. Half Shell.
Sauterne.
Consomme Princess.
Ollree. Radishes. Caviar on Toast.

tiring effort* of Chief Sullivan, he is there

reposed In him by the community of whose

Appended to thÂ» resolutions were tho
signatures of every member of the San
Francisco Fire Department. The volume
â¢was inclosed In a glass case resting on a
handsome rosewood table. The presenta
tion was made by Charles H. Ackerman
on behalf of the firemen. The Chief was
taken completely by surprise, and th<Â»
tears that rolled down his face were the
only expression of thanks that he could
command, so overcome was he with emo
tion. He had told his men before the
banquet was arranged that he did not be
lieve in those who were earning but a few
dollars a month spending their money for
a present for him. and threatened that IfNezv York Stock Market.
rvEW YORK, Jan. 4.â The mest conspicuous
feature cf the day's trading in stocks was the
continued heavy selling for foreign account,
about which there was considerable mystery.
The orders to sell in New York came from Lon
don, but London attributed them to Ber
lin account. Vienna adso reported sales
on its exchange for Berlin account. In
spite of the explanation that Berlin sell
ing was forced by money stringency, the
Berlin discount rate showed a rise of only %
per cent. In Berlin the der>res*lon was attrlb- !
uted to ths decline in English consols and to
the capture by the British of the German

puts and on a little buying influenced by the
strength of provisions touching 69?i"je;) 7 ic, and
eased off, closing Hfj)'4c under yesterday at
69% c.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Although closing above the worst, there was
general depression In the markets here to-day
on account of the position of the market, due
to the bad showing of the Berlin bank, show-
Ing a decrease of 8,000,000 marks In notes and
1,000,000 marks In cash. The German banks
have notified their customers that they must
reduce their speculative commitments and this
brought about forced sales all day, particularly
In the American department. A rumor from
Canada about a bank failure In Germany ap
pears to have no basis except the difficulties of
a private banker and broker. The depression
was Increased by the local loan Issue, alluded
to yeeterday, but apprehensions were dimin
ished by the publication of the Bank of Eng
land return for the week, showing an Increase
of Â£2.750.000 of bullion and reserve without any
increase in notes. Steady buying by New York
pwrtly counteracted the effect of the Berlin
sales of Americans, but failed to reassure Lon
don, which was also unsettled by manufactured
war rumors, such as that General Buller had
been defeated and that General Gatacre was
surrounded by Boer forces.
Paris was upset by the trouble in Berlin.
The bank bought Â£170,GC0 In .eagles and
Â£25,C00 gold In bars. At the same time Â£50,000
was withdrawn on the India currency account.
All gold arrivals are going to the bank.
Money was eaÃy, call money at 3 per cent be
ing unlendable In the afternoon. All loans from
the bank to thÂ« markets have been liquidated.

TO PRESENT A
NOVEL EXHIBIT
Will Be Given During
This Month.
PATRONS' WELCOME ANSWER
Iyocal art patrons will be afforded an
opportunity of enjoying a novel exhibition
at the Hopkins Institute during the latter
part of the present month. For a week or
longer the general public will be permit
ted to gare on the finest specimens of
bronzes and vases now ornamenting pri
vate residences in the city.
The board of directors of the San Fran
cisco Art Association decided to hold the
exhibition at a meeting yesterday after
noon. Their action was taken sooner than
expected on account of the large number
of prompt responses In the affirmative
made to requests for the loan of fine
pieces of bronzes and vases, insuring a
collection for the exhibit that will stir the
appreciative faculty of a connoisseur.
Nor will the association abate its en
deavor to enliven the populace with the
exhibition. It Is very probable that
toward the end of February the directors
will give a Mardi Gras ball. In accordance
with their annual custom. It was not
definitely decided to take this step at
yesterday s meeting on account of the
large amount of routine business, which
had accumulated so as to call for the im
mediate attention of the board, but a spe
cial meeting will bo held next Tuesday to
consider the Mardi Gras festival
This year"s Mardi Gras will, if anythin
attract more attention than those preced
ing, for the reason that it will occur on
Shrove Tuesday, February 27. As Captain
Robert Howe Fletcher, who has penned
a majority of the "royal proclamations"
for the Mardi Gras in former years Is
now curator of the institute. It is likely
that by his request Mayor Phelan may
on this occasion be requested to play the
part of scribe.

XII. ANDREW JACKSON.
Andrew Jackson Is one of the most con
spicuous and Important characters in
American history. His prominence Is In
large measure due not to the fact that he
was In himself a great constructive
statesman like Hamilton, or a great
orator like Clay, but to the fact that his
election to the Presidency and hi 3 subse
quent career mark out a new era In,
American politics and a new stage in the
development of democracy. The more
carefully one studies his life the more one
is led to look upon him not so much as a
personal force as an exponent of condi
tions, as a center from which can be
seen the United States as it was in IS3O,
and the fresh impulses that were express
ing themselves In the social and political
activities of the people.
He was born In South Carolinaâ at least
so he said himself, but Parton insists that
North Carolina was his birthplace. Such
ANDREW JACKSON.
a dispute Is the strongest proof of a very
humble origin. His boyhood was 6pent in
poverty, in squalor. In the midst of coarso
surroundings, and there is little or no In
dication that he sought to rise above cir
cumstances, or that, like Lincoln, am
bitious and energetic, he studlously
sought either learning or culture. His
early life Is unedifying and uninteresting,
for It gave no promise of a career above
that of his rollicking, careless, ignorant
companions, who reveled in cock fighting.
card playing and In all sorts of mischief
and horseplay.
He began the study of law (1754), but
he was not fitted either by temperament
or Industry to be a lawyer, and never
knew much law; perhaps it is not right
to suggest that he knew even Its funda
mental principles thoroughly. He natur
ally was averse to theoretical principles
of any sort.
Just after he became of age he moved
into Tennessee and entered upon a life In
the frontier community. He fitted well
Into this environment, for rough force,
courage and love of conflict were much
more In demand than culture and book
learning. The man who could succeed at
the bar or at anything else roust be ready
to play his part in a tavern brawl or to
respond promptly to the demands of the
code of honor.
Jackson was naturally quarrelsome and
domineering, and he did not lack oppor
tunity for exercising his native propensi
ties. We read of duels, In one of which he
killed his man, of feuds and fights of one
kind and another as Incidents In his Ten
nessee career, and he carried In his body
for twenty years a bullet from the pistol
of one of the Bentons, with whom he was
engaged In a disgraceful row in a tavern.
This was poor preparation for public ser
vice as a President of the United States,
and we can never go over the details of
this turbulent life without amazement
that this Irritable, pugnacious man should
be lifted out of the society In which he
swaggered and fought to become the chief
magistrate of a great nation. Even stran
ger does It appear that during the years
of which we have been speaking he held a
number of public offices that seem honor
able and dignified. He was Public Prose
cutor, Judge, Representative in Congress,
United States Senator. But the character
of the man and his fitness for responsibil
ity in a position where discretion and
calm judgment were needed are well Indi
cated by the words of Jefferson, who in
1824 said of him: "When I was president
of the Senate he was a Senator, and he
could never speak on account of the rash
ness of his feelings. I have seen him at
tempt It repeatedly, and as often choke
with rage." In 1818 Monroe asked Jefter
con what he thought of the wisdom of
appointing Jackson Minister to Russia,
and the venerable ex-President responded
in what seem to be words of astonishment
at Monroe's temerity: "Why, good Gâ d,
he would breed you a quarrel before he
had been there a month."
I have gone over some of the more Im
portant facts of Jackson's early career in
order to bring out somewhat clearly the
society from which he emerged, as well as
the essential character of the man. Al
though in later years as President of the
United States his manners were usually
dignified and courteous, although he had a
remarkable facility In winning adherents
and holding friends, and gave evidence
also of a strong mental grasp of things In
which he was personally interested, espe
cially of those which aroused his antago
nism, we cannot understand the more im
portant events of his later life nor the sig
nificance of his election to the Presidency
unless we have some appreciation of his
early surroundings and of the society of
which he was a part.
We must pass rapidly over his success
as an Indian fljrhter and the national re
nown he gained in the war of ISI2 by de
feating the Creeks and winning the battle
of New Orleans over the seasoned vet
erans of Pakenham. And we cannot more
than mention his invasion of Florida nnd
the victories of the Semlnole war a*lS).
In all places where there was need cf
forceful, unhesitating action, where diffi
culties were to be overcome by sheer de
termination and unrelenting purpose, he
always showed unusual capacity, as well
as surprising vigor and skill In manajring
or rather commanding his subordinates.
Jackson was put forward as a candidate
for the Presidency in 1524. His opponents
were Henry Clay. John Quincy Adams ar.d
William H. Crawford. That his name
should be mentioned at all may seem
strange enough, but It Is stranger still
that he should have received more elec
toral votes than any one of the others.
Inasmuch as none of the candidates re
ceived a majority of the electoral college
the choice from the highest three de
volved upon the House. Clay's name did
not go to the House, and he threw his in
fluence in favor of Adams, who was fleet
ed. There was at once an outcry from the
Jackson partisans, who Insisted that a
corrupt coalition had been formed and the
purposes and wishes of the people had
been circumvented. Bepton declared th-u
"Demoskrateo" principle, the principle
that the people had a right to govern, had
been disregarded. When Clay became Ad
ams' Secretary of State the denunciation
of corruption and of Interference with
[ popular desires became louder, while thÂ«
air was full of the clamor of those v,-ho
I proclaimed Jackson "a man of the pÂ«-i-

In 18CS Jackson was chosen President,
and hla victory was hailed as the begin

may on occasion

clares that each

and bo Judged by what he has accom

it does not glorify deficiencies in ability
or culture.
I The inauguration of Jackson ushered In
the spoils system. This came because of
the personal peculiarities of Jackson, who
believed that all who were not for him
were against him and who had been bred
' n a school where men rewarded their
friends and did no good to those that de
spitefully u?ed them. It came also be
cause the adherents of Adams and Clay
were lookad upon as supporters of a cor
rupt coalition; because there was a do
mand that the aristocracy of office hold
ers be overthrown; because the spoils
system had for years prevailed in some
of the States, and this election gave the
spoils politician his chance; because the
people resented the idea that training
and experience or that expert knowledge
were needed for the performance of of
ficial duty; because at the time there wa*
a clamorous and strident declaration that
one man was Just as good as another and
Just as much entitled to office.
The causes and significance of the be
ginnings of the spoils system can be seen
by anybody who reads and understands
the descriptions of Jackson's inaugura
tion, where a crowd of people pushed into
the drawing-rooms, elbowing Embassa
dors and other foreign representatives,
standing with muddy shoes on the dam
ask-covered furniture. "China and glass."
said an eye-witness, "to the amount of
several thousands of dollars was broken
in the struggle to get at the ices and
cakes, though punch and other drink
ables had been carried out in tubs and
buckets to the people." No one will deny
that there was something amiss In this
scramble for punch, and if he places im
portant offices in the places of ices and
drinks he will see the beginnings of the
spoils system and realize that there was
something false in that. too.
In spite of these unpropltiousi begin
nings and In spite of the malign Influence
of the back-stair politician during the
"reign of Andrew Jackson." those eight
years had much that was good in them.
Though the President was hot-headed and
Injudicious on occasions, he was thor
oughly honest, thoroughly patriotic, thor
oughly devoted to the good of the country
as he saw It. Historians have been wont
to lament his attack upon the Bank of
the United States, and we certainly can
not Justify his high-handed and imperious
methods in dealing with financial matters.
But, after all, Biddle and his bank are
comparatively unimportant. As the years
go by and we get a more distant view of
those times we see that the frontiersman
from Tennessee represented strong Ameri
can sentiment, that his famous proclama
tion against the nulllflers â whoever may
have written Itâ was a great and influen
tial public document, that by taking a
bold stand against the theories of seces
sion and of dissolution he Impressed his
party with sentiments of union, that we
owe him a very great debt of gratitude
for his famous toast, "Our Federal Union
âIt must be preserved." And If there
were disorder and some lawlessness in
those "vulgar Jackson days" he was mot
the cause. Ills election was the result of
a popular upheaval; his administration
was a time of great Intellectual activity,
a period in which the democratic senti
ment was finding new expression. lie was
himself a conspicuous expression of a
new. alert, energetic, forceful, assertive
spirit which was characteristic of Ameri
can life and was now dominant in Ameri
can politics.

There were two ceremonies performed

very few of those who witnessed the big

that fact. It was because of family de

and agreed to by all Interested. A cere

Mr. Macdonald's family are all Catho

England, and these differences explain
the two ceremones. The bride's family
desired a ceremony In their church and
it was arranged from the very first that
the wedding should be a church affair
and should take place at St. Paul's On
the other hand. the. family of the groom
was anxious that the rites of their

DENIES HE EVER PROPOSED.
Aged Joseph Boardman Takes the
Stand in His Own Defense.
"No, sir. . A thousand times no," said
aged Joseph Boardman yesterday when
his attorney, A. Y. Cotton, asked him
whether or not he had ever proposed mar
riage to Mrs. Elizabeth Gladstone.
"Did you ever say that you were lone
some and wished to live at her home with
her?" continued the attorney.
"No; a thousand times no," again an
swered the old man, as he fixed Tils eyes
on the woman who had taken him into
court to defend his fortune. Boardman's
examination, owing to his extreme age
and weakness, is slow and but little was
drawn from him during his stay on the
stand.
When the session opened In the morn-
Ing Mrs. Gladstone was again placed on
the stand. After denying that she wanted
her granddaughter to marry Boardman
and adding that she would not have him
anyway, Mrs. Gladstone changed the date
of the original proposal from June 6 to
April 6 of a year ago.
Mr. Boardman's young and pretty wife

fying that she was born In Trinity County
and was 18 years of age she left the stand

man her rent after the date on which she
said that she had promised to become his

SANTA CRUZ TO
HAVE ANOTHER
RAILROAD LINE
Supervisors Asked for
a Franchise.
EASTERN MONEY IS INVESTED

This afternoon the Board of Supervisors

I Â¦ M:r.ta Cruz. If the board grants the
franchise the Southern Pacific Railroad
WiU have a lively rival, as the proposed
road will pass through. San Mateo, Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz counties.
The road will be known as the "Bay and
Coast Railroad Company." On June 22 of
last year Â«rtlcles of incorporation were
filed for the construction of a steam or
electric railway in the counties named,
the estimated length to be 100 milea. L.

Hughee Michael T. Corcoran, J. B. Cronin
and H. I>any wore named as stockholders
and they subscribed {110.000 on a capital
stock of $3,000,000.
A franchise was secured in 1K92 by the
"West Shore Railroad Company" to build
a road that would skirt the bay shore,
and th's right was transferred to the new
corporation. The Board of Supervisors
which granted the original franchise only
permitted the road to be built within four
blocks of the county line, and as the Bay
and Coast Rallroaa Company proposes to
continue through to the city by the Eea,
its attorney was instructed to have the
defect remedied, and the new franchise is
requested by him on that ground.
Estimates for the construction of the
road wÂ«>re filed with the Mayor some time
ago. It is figured that it will cost between
$2,000,000 and $2,500,000. Attorney Riordan
yesterday Ktated that the road could be
l.uilt for less than $2,000,000 but for the cost
of steel and steam engines, which have
advanced in price by reason of the trusts.
Riordan stated that franchises had
betn secured In Santa Cruz and San Ma

Santa Clara County. He said the moment
the Board of Supervisors of this city and
county granted the franchise work on the

TWO INCH NEEDLE
IN BABY'S ABDOMEN
HE HELD THEM
AT BAY WITH
HIS SHOTGUN
Dr. Barthilemy Defied
Sheriff's Posse.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 4.
For nearly three hours this afternoon
Dr. Henri Barthllemy, a French physi
cian residing on the county road, held at
bay with his shotgun Deputy. Sheriff
Qulnlan and Constable Cramer.
Qulnlan and Cramer had called at Bar
thilemy's home to arrest him and his
stepson, Eugen? Dautrevaux, on war
rants sworn out by Valentine G. Hush of
Fruitvale, charging them with petit lar
ceny. Hush lost a valuable cocker span
iel about five weeks ago. Some one stole
the dog, and believing that he had lo
cated the animal In Dr. Barthilemy's
yard. Hush swore to a complaint in Jus
tice Larue's court.
Dautrevaux was arrested as he stepped
out of his stepfather's buggy in front of
their home. Although no resistance was
made, handcuffs were placed on his
wrists while he was being taken to the
County' Jail.
The peace officers had no such time
with the doctor, who is close to 70 years
of age and is not conversant with the
English tongue. Seeing his stepson In the
clutches of the law, he secured his shot
gun ard. stationing himself in his door
way, defied the officers to "come sil vous
plait."
Sheriff Rogers was telephoned to for
additional men to execute the warrant,
and he and Deputy Jailer Taylor hurried
to the scene. As the evening shades were
falling Barthilemy's arms became weary
of holding the deadly shotgun and a
truce was declared. Finally a boy who
is versed in the Parisian tongue was se
cured to act as interpreter to inform the
doctor of the object of the officers' visit.
The doctor tried to explain that the
cooker spaniel had been his own for more
than a year, but his protestations proved
futile and he was taken to the County
Jail and placed In a cell with his step
son.
Dautrevaux Insists that Hush Is mis
taken. He threatens to sue for heavy
damages for false arrest and imprison
ment.
The affair created quite a sensation on
the county road and a large crowd wa9
attracted to the scene.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 4.â A 9-months-old baby with a sewing needle embedded
in its abdomen for three days Is the latest freak. The child is Charles
Lincoln, son of Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Hackett, a colored couple residing at
1608 Union street. While dressing him yesterday morning the mother
noticed that the baby screamed whenever she laid it face downward. She ex
amined Its body and discovered a hard substance under the skin covering the
abdomen. Just above the navel. There was considerable inflammation.
Mrs, Hackett grew alarmed and sought medical assistance. A thorough
examination by a physician revealed a bright piece of steel in the Inflamed
part. After some little difficulty a needle was extracted. It proved to be two
inches in length, the kind commonly used to carry heavy black thread. In the
opinion of the physician It must have been embedded at least three days. It
has turned black since it has been exposed to the air.
"The wonder is the baby did not cry all the time the needle was .under its
skin," said Mrs. Hackett. "Charley has been playing right along with the
other children as if nothing had happened. I do not know how the needle got
where it did. The most reasonable explanation is that one of the family had
it pinned In some clothing, and that In caressing the child it was accidentally
thrust into his abdomen. Still It must have been pushed quite hard, because If
it had not some portion would have remained exposed to catch the clothing.
The needle lay an eighth of an inch beneath the skin. It might have gon'j
straight inward and caused the child's death. He is perfectly well again and
EMMONS SAYS HE
DID NOT WRITE
THOSE LETTERS
Denies Any Connec
tion With Them.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 4. â The name of
George W. Emmons is mentioned in con
nection with the Delanoy anonymous let
ters. Emmons refuses to make any state
ment other than to deny emphatically
their authorship. Delanoy will not state
definitely that Emmons Is the man he sus
pects.
This much was learned of the relations
of Delanoy and Emmons: They were as
sociated In the wholesale paper supply
business ten years ago. They had a dis
agreement and have not since been friend
ly. Emmons Is now In the drayage busi
ness and hauls goods for a paper house.
This fact furnishes Delanoy with a con
nection between Emmons and the kind of
stationery used in the letters. *
The publication of the suspect's name as
"George" and hints dropped by Delanoy
that he resided on San Jose avenue and
has lived in Alameda for eight years led
some persons who know of the former re
lations of Delanoy and Emmons to sur
mise that Emmons is the man held re
sponsible by Delanoy for the anonymous
missives. Emmons resides with his fam
ily at 1537 San Jose avenue. He has been
a resident eight years. He is one of the
directors of the Encinal Yacht Club.
Unsigned letters are still coming Dela
noy's way. For an Indefinite time he an
ticipates getting one or more anonymous
communications every â¢ day. The mail
brought him two this mor.nlng. One en
closed a heavy piece of cardboard upon
which was drawn a skull and cross-bones.
The words "Move! Second warning!
Whltecaps!" in large pen and ink letters
were printed beneath the sketch.
The other was a postal card. In pencil
was written: "Committee are on to you.
In twenty-four hours you will be cold in
death. Take time by the forelock and
flee. Alameda Highbinder Societe, Tong
No. 1." Both communications were
mailed in San Francisco.
Delanoy is taking, the letters seriously.
He believes the man he suspects of annoy
ing him Is trying to cover up his tracks
by overwhelming him with facetious let
ters. A deluge of premature valentines
would not astonish him. The fact that the
whole town is amused at the Jibes of his
enemy does not make him the less deter
mined in his intentions. He is going to
"nail his man or bust." He has purchased
a gun, and stands ready to use it. He has
no idea of heeding the admonition to va
cate Alameda.
"This man," said Delanoy, "had a pur
pose in using the name of Tong No. 1 of
the Alameda Highbinders. I don't know
what his. motive was. but I know he had
one. I know he was a candidate for mem
bership in the tong, but was blackballed.
To me he attributes the fact. I had noth
ing to do with it. I've got him where I
want him now. He cannot escape. He
will be*exposed.
Tong No. 1 of the Alemeda Highbinders'
Society is a local organization of citizens
for the promotion of good times and good
fellowship. The members deny responsi
bility for Delanoy's postal card. They
feel chagrined that any one should be so
base as to use the name of their society
for the purpose of covering up a crime.
F. N. Delanoy of Alameda caller! upon
Postal Inspector Munro yesterday for the
purpose of having action taken against
the writer of scurrilous anonymous let
ters addressed to him. He received yes
terday morning a postal card with the
following inscription:
ALAMEDA. Jan. 4.
The eommitte is on. to you and Inside of
twenty-four hours you will be cold in death.
Take time by the forlock and flee.
THE ALEMADA HIGHBINDERS SOCIETIE
TON a NO. 1.
Mr. Delanoy gave Chief Inspector
Munro the name of the man whom lie
suspected to be the writer of ihe postals
and the letters which he had been re
ceiving', but the Inspector declined to
make the name public. Mr. Munro said
that sealed letters containing scurrilous
matter were not within his province as
violations of the postal laws, but that
postal cards bearing abusive, dunning or
threatening matter came within his do
main, and that if Mr. Delanoy would
place him in possession of evidence con
necting the person named with the au
thorship of the postal card he would
prosecute him and endeavor to have him
punished to tire full extent of the law.

BEAR GOES TO
SAN DIEGO TO
DRY HER BONES
Will Lie There Until
Spring.
The revenue cutter Bear Is being got
ready over at Sausallto for her trip to
San Diego. She is to He up at the Lower
California port until the spring and while
there will be thoroughly dried. She has
been so long In the frozen north that her
timbers have become thoroughly soaked
and the vessel's speed has been reduced
fully three knots an hour. It is to dry out
the ship that the trip to San Diego is
being taken.
The Bear yesterday went alongside the
revenue cutter Thetis at Sausallto, and
everything that could be spared from the
Bear was put aboard her. On arriving
at San Diego the Bear will be tied up
alongside the wharf at Coronado and
stripped. All the stores, ballast, furnish
ing equipment, and, In tact, everything
but the engines and boilers will be re
moved and the officers and crew will take
irp their abode ashore. Windsails will
then be put down into the 'tween decks
and lower hold, and in this way Captain
Tuttle expects to dry out his vessel thor
oughly. After the air of San Diego has
done its work the stores and other things
will be put aboard again and the revenue
cutter will come to San Francisco to be
fitted out for another cruise in the Arctic.
The Bear will sail for San Diego to-mor
row and Captain Tuttle expects her to be
at least a three-knot faster ship coming
home than she is now.
The collier Czarina arrived from the
Sound yesterday after a chapter of acci
dents. On November 4 laÂ«t she started
for this port. Ever since she has been
trying to get here. Soon after leaving
Tacoma she broke her shaft and the pro
peller fell into the Sound. Arrangements
were then made with the tug Holyoke to
tow the vessel to this port. Four days
later a start was made. Getting outside
the Straits of Juan de Fuca a southeast
gale came up, and finding that he could
only make a mile an hour with his tow
the captain of the Holyoke put back.
A few days later another start was
made and In two days the tug and her
tow had covered 100 miles. During the
next two days it blew a hurricane from
the southeast and the collier was blown
back fifty miles and a second time the
tug took 'her back into Puget Sound. On
this occasion the services of the tug were
dispensed with and the Czarina went to
Quartermaster Harbor, where she dis
charged her cargo and went on the dry
dock. A new shaft and propeller were
sent up from San Francisco and put In
place on their arrival and the collier, tak
ing another load aboard, made the run
from Neah Bay to San Francisco In five
da vs. Captnln Seaman says the new pro
pefler is the best that has ever been
lined to the steamer and that she now
makes better time and handles better
than ever before.
The bark Santiago will sail for Honolulu
this morning loaded to the gunwales with
freight and with thirty-three head of
cattle on deck. Owing to the rush of
merchandise to Honolulu the Suntiago
was taken off the Hilo run for this trip.
On her return to San Francisco she will
load for Hilo. The big four-masted bark
Falls of Clyde, now due any day, has a
full cargo fbr Hilo awaiting her.
The overdue British ship Musselcrag,
on which 10 per cent reinsurance was
paid, has teen heard from. A dispatch
from London to the Merchants' Exchange
states that she is coming here via Aus
tralia. She signaled Cape Otway (near
Melbourne, Australia), that she had lost
some sails, her bulwarks were stove In
and decks swept. The captain wished to
be reported all well. The Musselcrag is
now out 1~>) days from Antwerp for San
Francisco, and the supposition is that
she was caught in the storm off the Horn
that did so much damage to the Godlva.
The British ship Matterhorn is now out
Ijo days from Antwerp for San Francisco
and 1') per cent is being paid to reinsure
her, while 20 per cent is being paid on
the General Neumayer. now out 135 days
from Swansea. It may be that both of
these vessels are following the Mussel
crag around the Cape of Good Hope.
The steamer Elihu Thomson has been
charterer! by \V. B. King and Walter S.
Soammell and will be put in the Nome
trade in the spring.

DE PACHMANN
UNSATISFYING
MY enjoyment of De Paehmann has
suffered a diminution with each suc
cessive recital, and while In certain
phases he Is sure to please, his de
ficiencies become more marked after
every hearing. I have little sympathy
with the prevalent opinion that among
pianists the latest Is the btst and would
pray of the public and the critics to show
a little more discrimination.
Bloomtield-Feisler, Rosenthal, Carreno
and Saver have successively eclipsed one
another, and on the return of Paderewski,
who has been so berated in his absence,
he is certain to be hailed as the greatest
of all. At present De Paehmann is given
priority over the rest for no better reason
than that he Is here, but as a matter of
fact hU station is below that of the ar
tists I have named. As to his ability as
an interpreter of Chopin, the recital yes
terday.afternoon, which was made up Â«?n
tirt'ly of Chopin numbers, only served to
fortify me in the opinion I expressed after
his last concert, which was that he shines
with true brilliancy only in the dance mu
sic. . .
It was quite generally opined that De
Paehmann had broadpned his scope plnce
his last visit here, but in point of fact I
think he hns none oft materially. "His
playing of the funeral march was not
ajjrh as I remembered it nine years ago.
It was yesterday very blunt and soulless.
The liarcarole Op. 60, F sharp, the Noc
turne Op. 55, No. 1, and the Berceuse
were all deficiently given, particularly the
last, which we have heard recently so well
rendered by Carreno and Saver, and to
which even Rosenthal, a notably cold pi
anist, gave a much more eloquent reading.
De Paehmann played the Ballade Op. 23
brilliantly, two etudes In which he la al
ways Interesting', two waltzes with his pe
culiar finesse and three mazurkas, of
which the second. Op. 67, No." 1, was easily
the gem of the programme. One cannot
auk for more than he gives In these dance
themes and his knack for the etudes is
almost as marked. But In the Nocturnes
and the more serious Preludes De Paeh
mann is temperamentally inadequate.

RAILWAY AGENTS
DISCUSS CUT RATES
Twenty or More Prominent Lines
Represented at a Conference
Held in Boston.
BOSTON, Jan. J.â Twenty or more rail
road lines, East and West, were repre
sented in the conference of passenger
agents in this city to-day- at the office of
the New England Passenger Association.
Included in the gathering were represen
tatives from the Canadian Pacific, Atchi
son, Chicago and Northwestern, Chicago,
Rock Island and I aciflc, Great Northern,
Southern Pacific, Union Pacitic, Central
Pacific and trunk lines.
The long-standing troubles over railroad
rates was the Question which the confer
ence had. been called to discuss. For
months the so-called standard and differ
ential lines have been cutting rates to
the West and points on the Pacific Slope.
The New England Passenger Association
has been the one to cut rates.
The cut rates are via Montreal and are
$25 CO from Boston to Colorado common
points. $26 60 from Boston to California
common points, and $33 TO from Boston to
Pacific Coast points. The contest all day
to-day centered on the refusal of the dif
ferential lines out of Boston to abandon
the authorized schedule. They hold that
if the standard lines had allowed the
other lines the differential to which they
were entitled rates would have been kept
up.
The question of tourist car service was
also taken up during the forenoon session.
The whole afternoon was spent in talk.
An EaFtern and Western committee was
appointed to investigate and report upon
the subject. After it had been given a
full discussion, and at 6 p. m., without
reaching- any practical result, the con
ference adjourned, to meet at 10 a. m.
Monday next at the Hotel Waldorf-
Astoria, New York.
MAY NOT REDEEM
AGRICULTURAL PARK
No Quorum Present at the Meeting
of the Santa Clara Agricultural
Association.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 4.â Lack of a quorum
at a meeting of the life members of the
Santa Clara Agricultural Society called
for to-day gives color to the report that
the association will not be able to re
de-em its racecourse and fair grounds sold
under execution some six months ago.
At that time W. G. Andrews, represent
ing a number of creditors, obtained Judg
ment against the society for about J16.000
and purchased Agricultural Park under
foreclosure proceedings. The time to re
deem the property expires in June, and
from the lack of interest shown to-day it
is not believed it will be redeemed.
The property is worth about $100,000 and
lies within a mile of the center of the
city and contains about 100 acres. Rad
management got the society into legal
and rlnancial complications. About the
only way for the society to get on its feet
again seems to be to borrow money, pay
off the $16,000 debt and then sell part of its
lund. As its credit has been bad many
members object to this increase incurring
new obligations, and refuse to have any
thing to do with the matter. This was
undoubtedly the cau?e of the lack of a
quorum. Another attrmpt will be made
to get the life members together again on
the first Thursday in February.
MONTAGUE ROGERS DEAD.
Was One of the Leading Lawyers of
Cleveland.
Special Bisratch to The Call.
SAX JOSK, Jan. I.â Montague Rogers, a
retinvl lawyer of Cleveland, Ohio, who
has made his home In this city for the
past eight years, died late Wednesday
evening at 279 East San Fernando street.
Rogers was a native of England and G2
ypars old. lie came to California from
Ohio for the benefit of his health, being a
sufferer from asthma. Deceased had a
large law practice in Ohio and had a rep
utation as expfrt counsel in disputed
handwriting- cases. He was possessed of
an estate worth $100,000, consisting chiefly
of Cleveland property He leaves a
daughter in Pittsbur-r and several
brothers In Ohio. He had taken precau
tions that no contest should arise over his
estate, and after his death a bundle of
deeds to property were iound, with' in
structions to forward them to his
daughter.
PREMIER YAMAGATA
IS GRAVELY ACCUSED
Memorial to the Throne of Japan
Makes Charges of Extensive
Corruption.
YOKAHAMA, Dec. 16 (via Victoria. B.
C, Jan. 4).â The memorial to the throne
brought Into the Diet this week by the op
position is practically an impeachment of
Premier Marquis Yamaeata and Home
Minister Marquis Reigo for corrupt prac
tices. Specifications allege undue influence
used by the Government in the recent
elections, and the granting of a charter in
the great muicipai improvement scheme
as a direct bribe for securing the passage
of the Government bill. As the indict
ment Is made by a party which is itself
by no means untainted with corruption,
and Is in a hopeless minority, swift defeat
will be the fate of the measure.

LAWRENCE I DWYER, SUPERVISOR-ELECT.
they would not resist the election of a
good Republican to succeed Senator
Dwyer.
A special election was called in the
Eighth Senatorial District last February
to fill the vacancy in the State Senate
Caused by the death of Hon. John Boggs.
Governor Gage then maintained that it
was not in his power to save to-the coun
ties comprising the district the expense of
a special election, although it was con
ceded that the Senator chosen could not
receive his certificate of election many
days before the expiration of the session.
Having been officially advised that a va
cancy existed, the Governor maintained
that the constitution required that he
should call an election, and the law giving
force and effect to the constitutional pro
vision provided that he should call the
election at once.
The notion that the Governor may de
liberately ignore the constitution Is not
entertained. Certainly he has no con
tempt the constitution, because con
tempt usually springs from familiarity.
All things considered, It is predicted that
Gage will order a special election in the
Nineteenth District to fill the vacancy
caused by Senator Dwyer's resignation.
BAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 6, 1900.
Hon. Jacob H. Neff. Lieutenant Gov
ernor, State of California. President
of the Senate â Sir: Having been elected
as a member of the Board of Super
visors of the City and County of San
Francisco, I most respectfully resign
as a State Senator from the Nineteenth
Senatorial District.
This reslcnatlon is forwarded to you
In compliance with the provisions of
subdivision S of section 995 of the Politi
cal Code for the State of California.
Very respectfully,
LAWRENCE J. DWYER.
THE foregoing resignation was trans
mitted to Lieutenant Governor Neff
last evening and will without delay
be forwarded to Governor Gage as
the law requires.
It is such an unusual occurrence for a
Senator to resign that members of the
Legislature who were consulted yesterday
on this matter could not at first tell to
whom the resignation should be ad
dressed. Some legislators contended that
the letter should be addressed directly to
the Governor, while others fancied that
the Secretary of State was the officer to
address.
Reference to the Political Code cleared
away all doubts and Incidentally directed
attention to the fact that the law re
quires the Governor to call a special elec
tion to fill a vacancy in the Legislature
Immediately upon securing a resignation.
Under the new charter, section 4, article
XVI, a Supervisor of San Francisco can
not hold any other salaried public office,
therefore Senator Dwyer must resign his
State office to qualify as a member of the
Board of Supervisors.
In the event of an extra session of the
Legislature the vacancy caused by Mr.
Dwyer's resignation will have a slight
bearing on the ballot for United States
Senator if the Governor falls to call an
election to fill such vacancy. Only sixty
votes will be required to elect on joint
ballot if Mr. Dwyer's place is not filled.
The Democratic majority in the Nine
teenth Senatorial District is so slight
that it could be easily overcome by an
able and Independent Republican of anti
boss sympathies. The active young men
of the Democratic party are so discour
aged and demoralized over the knifing
they received from Mayor Phelan that
HEALTH BOARD WILL FIGHT.
The Members in Executive Session
Decide to Hold On.
The Board of Health held an informal
session yesterday morning with Drs.
Coffey, Payne and Barbat, Health Officer
Lawlor and Secretary Edgar B. Carroll
present. Though it was given out that
the executive meeting was for the pur
pose of taking steps to prevent the en
trance of bubonic plague to this port by
steamers coming from Honolulu, it is be
lieved that the real purport of the gather-
Ing was to discuss the necessary, ar
rangements to hold office against the ap
pointees of Mayor Phelan. Attorney
Charles Heggerty. associate of George A.
Knight, official attorney of the board, was
also present, and he read several opinions
and decisions to show that the board was
a State body and that the municipality
had no jurisdiction over it.
The present board, however, will make
no active fight to retain office, but will
rely on the fact that the new charter was
procured through p new amendment to
the constitution numbered "8%." which
provided for a board of freeholders who
framed a charter providing for all de
partments except the Health Board. The
matter was postponed until Saturday
morning, when another meeting will take
place to outline the course to be pursued
The board also discussed the bubonic
plague, which is said, to be raging in
Honolulu. It was decided to thoroughly
disinfect each vessel which may come to
this port from the Islands, and if the
Federal quarantine officer allows any ves
sel to dock she will be taken out in the
stream and fumigated to the satisfaction
of the local health authorities.
ELLARD D. SLACK, a deputy In the office of Auditor Wells, closed his New
Year's festivities yesterday afternoon by sending a bullet through his
brain. He had been dissipating for several days and believing that it was
' Impossible for him to extricate himself from financial difficulties that had
been gradually accumulating upon him he determined to end his life. Shortly
after 6 o'clock he left several boon companions and entered a Market street
saloon. He walked to the rear of the establishment and ascended a short
flight of stairs to one of the cardrooms.
A moment later the attendants heard a shot and a fall. They rushed up
stairs and found Slack with the revolver In his hand and the blood streaming 1
from his head. The bullet, which had been fired with deadly accuracy, had passed
through his head. As quickly as possible he was removed to the Receiving Hos
pital, where the physicians declared that death was only a matter of a very few
hours.
Slack was a young man widely and favorably known in the city and his
tragic death is a matter of sincere regret to hundreds of men whose esteem
and good will he won. About two years ago he entered local politics and was
caught In the dangerous whirl that has proved so disastrous to many. He in
terested himself in the political fortunes of Auditor Wells and gave his time and
his money to assist the Auditor in his campaign. After the election of Mr.
WellÃ Slack received In compensation one of the best positions In the Auditor's
office.
For several months he conducted himself with the utmost propriety. Then
he had several lapses, which gradually became more frequent. He began to
neglect his duties and to drink. On one occasion he appeared for work in an
Intoxicated condition and was cautioned not to repeat the offense. Counsel and
admonition seemed to have no effect, however, and at the end of the year the
climax came.
Slack left his desk and started out to close the year with a drinking bout.
With several companions he went to one of the resorts on the ocean beach,
where he remained for two days. Still In an Intoxicated condition, he returned
to town and went to the racecourse at Tanforan Park. The racetrack had al
ready cost him a great deal of money. Time after time he had wagered and
lost, until he had exhausted not only his own money but all that he could bor
row. He had become Involved financially to such a degree that the prospect of
retrieving seemed remote.
Money lenders were harassing him, tradesmen were demanding what he owed
them and proprietors of local resorts were Insisting that he make a settlement.
He determined to make one more effort at the racecourse. He succeeded in
obtaining between $300 and $400, and with this sum went to Tanforan. Luck was
Btill against him. On Tuesday he lost $200 and on Wednesday lost $100 more.
These losses completed what drink and other reverses had already begun.
Slack decided that death was the only solution of his troubles.
He made, however, another effort to recover. He forsook his companions,
stopped drinking and yesterday afternoon reported to Auditor Wells. The Audi
tor was naturally angry and informed Slack that he had been suspended un
til next Monday. With this information Slack left the City Hall and went down
town. He bought a revolver and decided to kill himself. He went to a resort
en Market and Second streets and there. In the presence of a friend, destroyed his
letters and private papers. He then proceeded up the street, entered a saloon
on Market street, near Stockton, and there sent a bullet through his brain.
One of the most remarkable incidents In connection with the tragedy was fur
nished by the suicide's brother. A few minutes after Slack fired the bullet into
his brain his brother entered the saloon. He called for a drink and was told
what had happened just a few moments before. For a moment he staggered
and then with an oath he rushed from the saloon. He excitedly accosted several
people and then boarded a car that carried him to the Receiving Hospital. Here
his conduct was as extraordinary as It had been in the resort where his brother
had ended his life. The physicians in attendance turned over to him the dying
man's effects and he rushed upstairs to police headquarters, constantly reiterat
ing that his dying brother was a fool. In order to quiet and reassure him he
was placed in charge of a detective and taken from the City Hall.
Auditor Wells was deeply shocked last night when he was told what Slack
had done. "I do not believe," he Bald, "that the young man ever committed a dis
honest act. He was one of the most efficient clerks in my service, and until very
recently I had no cause to censure him. His particular duty was to attend to the
records of the license office, and In that work he had no opportunity to handle
money not his own. When he came to me to-day and was told that he was sus
pended until Monday he seemed to be very despondent. I am very* sorry thac he
has made away with himself."
Slack died at 12:10 o'clock this morning. He never regained consciousness.
Site of New Bank Building, Market and Geary Streets.
BY a sale concluded yesterday Mrs. Florence Blythe-MoorÂ» conveyed tÂ©
the Mutual Savings Bank, of which Mayor Phelan is president,, a plat of
land between Market and Geary streets, about forty feet west of the
Junction with Kearny street. The lot Is to be used for a magnificent
fireproof modern building of stone and brick, seven or eight stories high, of
which the ground floor will be arranged for the offices of the bank. The price
paid for the land is in the neighborhood of $300,000. and the deed was made by
Gunnison, Booth & Bartnett, representing Mrs. Moore, the final papers being
signed yesterday noon.
The deal is significant In that the bank expressed its confidence In tnÂ»
Blythe title, and with this precedent it is expected that other sales of Blytha
property will soon be made, and that the old frame buildings will be succeed
ed by modern skvscraDers.
Five one or two-story shacks will have to be pulled down to make room
for the new bank building. On Market street the Komfort shoe store and Liv
ingston's dry goods store must go. The Geary street frontage of these stores,
as well as a shaving parlor, a button factory, a trunk store and an artificial
limb factory, must also be moved from the site acquired by the bank.
The bank will at once have plans prepared for Its new building, and the
work will be pushed as fast as possible. There are no leases in existence to
prevent immediate work, and after the plans are ready the tenants can all be
moved in a month.
At 5 o clock last evening Mayor Phelan. president, and Frank J. Sullivan.
attorney of the Mutual Savings Bank; A. T. Spotts, president of the Cali
fornia Title Insurance and Trust Company; representatives of Slmoson &
Millar, searchers of records; and Attorney Walter J. Bartnett of the firm
of Gunnlson, Booth & Bartnett, who have been conducting the negotiations,
visited the Recorder's office and filed for record the eight deeds necessary
to perfect title In the consummation of the important deal. After the
necessary details had been attended to the party adjourned to the Mayor'Â«
office, where Attorney Bartnett cave the hlstorv ot the negotiations.
"Mrs. Florence Blythe-Moore," he said, "has purchased the Interests of
General W. H. H. Hart. John H. Boalt. John Garber. S. Woolberg, Thomas
B. Bishop, George E. Bates and W. W. Foote in and to the Blythe block, and
she is now vested with the title In fee simple to the entire block. The In
terests were distributed as follows: Attorney Hart, 12Vi per cent (of which hÂ«
surrendered l-175th to Woolberg and 1 per cent to Bates; Boalt, 2 per CÂ«nt;
Garber. 2 per cent: Bishop. 2 per cent: and Foote. 2 per cent.
"Mrs. Moore has also settled the Steele suit of $60,000. This was an action
brought by the executrix of the last will of E. L. G. Steele, deceased. The
Mutual Savings Bank becomes the purchaser of the two most easterly lots
of the Blythe block and all the deeds were recorded this evening. The Title
Insurance and Trust Company has insured the title and given a policy of In
surance for $1,000,000 on a loan for a similar amount, which will bÂ« consum
mated In New York in thirty days. The title company has arranged for the
reinsurance of the title to the extent of $750,000 in one of the leading title
insurance companies in New York. All the necessary papers are now beinj
escrowed to release various hens, claims, mortgages and Judgments against
the property which have been In process of settlement for threÂ« month*
past.
"The McAllister demands set up In the suit brought by Attorney Bergin
on his 3 per cent contract have been adjusted and an amicable settlement ef
fected with nearly all parties holding contracts or demands against Mrs.
Moore. Seven suits have been dismissed, eight Judgments satisfied, and
there now remains on the property only a mortgage of $53,500, loaned to Mr.
and Mrs. Moore by the Mutual Saviners Bank at 6 per cent.
The title to the property is now in merchantable shape, bo that tt can bÂ«
sold. That portion lying east of Brook street will be sold also, and subse
quently the western portion of the block will be improved by Mr. and Mrs.
Moore in a manner that will be an ornament to the city."
Another of the many Blythe estate contests has been passed upon by the
Supreme Court, and the young woman that the courts have tlma and again
decided to be the child and heir of Thomas H. Blythe. deceased, gains Judg
ment. Boswell M. Blythe brought action against Florence Blythe-Hlnckley
(now Mrs. A. A. Moore Jr.) to recover certain lands in this city belonging to
the estate. He set up the claim as heir at law of Thomas H. Blythe. and
contended that the proceedings and Judgments of the Superior and Supreme
courts distributing the estate to the heiress were void on the ground that, at
the time of Blythe's death she was an alien and there is no law permitting
non-resident aliens to Inherit real estate. In the lower court a general de
murrer was entered and sustained, from which an appeal was taken. The
Supreme Court yesterday sustained the defendant's demurrer.

bÂ« the uncle of the young woman, his
niece Is the unfortunate victim of some
miscreant, and, dax^d and stupefied by
tome drug, she wandered into the room
occupied oy Duncan, and the arrest fol
lowed.
Duncan r**Â« further than the diamond
Â¦a** Aivtr , Â«??_Â£ declare* tha^?^ waa tftk>q
out of his pockets. The theory of the po
lice is that the woman had been In Dun
can's room earlier In the evening, and hail
returned to get another $25 she had pre
viously overlooked, when Duncan awoke
and caught her in the act.
"Of course my niece's name Is not Mary
Brown," said Zeilin, "and I consider it
fortunate that she had enough reason left
when arrested to give a fictitious name. 1
dare not think what has happened to the
poor girl. She came over from her home
In Contra Costa on Wednesday afternoon,
and was to have gone with me In the even
ing to dinner and the theater. I waited
for her and she did not come. I grew
alarmed and began to search about town
for her. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock
I received word that 6he was at the City-
Prison. I hastened at once to her, and
found that she had beÂ«n drugged and was
altogether unable to explain how she had
come into the house where she was found
"It Is ridiculous to suppose that she was
there to steal. Her mother, who is a
widow, owns one of the largest ranches in
Contra Costa County, and the young
woman has all the money she can possibly
need."
Mr. Zeilln would not disclose the where
abouts of his nifce yesterday. "There is
no reason to see her," he said. "She is
still under the influence of the drug ad
ministered and is unable to make any ex
planation."
When searched at the prison Mary
Brown had no money about her person
The theory of the police and Duncan ie
that the woman passed her first haul to a
confederate who awaited her in the corri
dor outside Duncan's apartment. Zeilln
declares that instead of having robbed
Duncan his niece has been robbed, and he
reports the loss of a valise containing sil
ver toilet articles and $50 in gold coin.
Mary Brown was arraigned before Judge
Conlan yesterday morning and ordered to
appear for trial on next Tuesday morning.
She waa released from custody on |10W

elevator which had been placed In position

from the first floor. Walsh, who was
painting the Interior of the shaft, had a
plank stretched across it at the first
landing. He did not see the elevator com
ing until it was almost above him. He
screamed, but his warning was not
sounded in time to prevent the heavy tim
bers from crushing him. As soon as pos
sible the man was released and his body
fell off the plank to the bottom of the
shaft. The skull was fractured and hÂ»?
was evidently killed Instantly.

PHELAN SAID TO SECOND HIM
HIS BBWABD FOB SERVICES TO
THE ORGANIZATION.
Charlie Fay, the fifth wheel of the local
Democratic "organization," Is afflicted
with an aspiration. It's no simple politi
cal ambition that has stricken him; it's
a slmonpure aspiration of large and am
ple proportions, and according to Mr. Fay
it is non-partisan In its character. The
fact Is that Mr. Fay wants to get out of
politics and considers the best way out
of It the secretaryship of the Incoming
Park Commission. According to the wise
ones he Is out for that Job with all the
fervor of young ambition, and the Mayor
is behind him with all the force of a keen
desire to unload him upon that body.
Mr. Fay's aspiration to become a secre
tary and a non-partisan all in one bunch
;lÂ°sw e S. ent B ene ratlon; so recent In fact
that it dates back only to Saturday last
when Mayor Phelan In making his ap
pointments declined to honor any of the
suggestions made by Mr. Fay or Gavin
McNab.
Mr. Fay saw the futility of partisan
politics at that minute, and then and
there came to an Irrevocable conclusion
that he could do better and more gen
erously serve the best interests of New
ban Francisco as a modest secretary on
an artistic commission than as the more
or less modest messenger boy of a soul
less and unappreciatlve "organization,"
no matter how close to the throne his
station.
He communicated his conviction to the
Mayor, who, it Is said, warmly commend
ed his perception and promised to do all
In his power to convince the Park Com
mission of Mr. Fay's deserving qualities.
\\ ith this confirmation of his own opin
ions, Mr. Fay. it is said, has started out
to unload himself and his well-known
abilities upon the park people, and noth
ing short of his success is being pre
dicted.

JOHN MOONEY, Lieutenant.
JOE BURNETT. Sergeant.
LIONEL SHAW. Sergeant.
HERBERT WRIGHT. Sergeant.
JOHN T. FITZHENRY. Sergeant.
JULES J. CALLUNDAN. Patrolmar
THE Police Commissioners met
yef=tÂ»Tday afternoon and appointed
a successor to Lieutenant Nash,
deceased, four sergeants and one
patrolman.
Sergeant Mooney. who was advanced
tr. the rank of lieutenact. has been doing
fluty at the North End station and Bur
nett has t>een connected with the O'Far
rell-Mxeet station for some time.
Wright, or "Handsome Al," as he Is
known to his associates. Is now a
clerk in the Chiefs office. He has
t host of friends in the department.
HÂ«* will undoubtedly eueoeed Sergeant
Bethel, retired, in caring for the sick
and wounded members of the force.
Ehaw, who is one of the most popular
members of the force, has been connected
with the harbor station for some time, and
formerly had charge of the police gymna
elum. He was warmly congratulated by
his fellow officers when his appointment
was announced. Fltzhenry, the "sweet
linger of the department," as he is famil
iarly called, has fc*-en doing clerical work
In the Southern Station, and is considered
one of the most careful and conscientious
members cf the force.
The most surprising appointment, how
ever, was that of Jult-s J. Callundan. For
years pa*:. Callundan has been acting at.
captain of Morse's Patrol.
In that capacity he has been earning a
salary of $15<i a month. Why he should
resign his position to accept a place as
an ordinary patrolman fairly mystified
Jiot only his friends, but the heads" of thÂ»Â»
department.
After the meeting, however, it developed
that Callundan f> appointment as a police
man was Intended as a "joker" to pave
the way for him to the oflice <>t Chief of
Detectives under the new hoard of Police
Commissioners. Commissioner Gunst, who
is said to be a party to the deal, pro
posed Callundan's name at the meeting
cf the board and moved that he be ap
pointed a member of the regular force.
For a mlr.ute the other Commissioners.
Including Chief Lees, were nonplussed
Lees has no love for Callundan on ac
count of his association with Harry
Morce, whom he dislikes with the hatred
of a. Dipper Indian. Notwithstanding
Leep' opposition, Gunst won his point, and
Callundan was duly appointed and sworn
In as a full-fledged policeman.
When seen after the meeting 5n refer
ence to Ca.llundan'6 appointment Gunst
Â¦aid:
"I suppose Callundan was appointed
through Dan Burns. The colonel is on
very friendly terms -with Morse, and as
the latter wanted Callundan appointed
Burns went to the front for him."
"Did you not propose his name at the
meeting'?" was aeked.
"I don't care to discuss It," he an
swered. "I have already told you that
Burns is responsible for the appoint
ment."
Asked if It was not slated that Callun
dan should succeed Captain of Detectives
Bohen. Commissioner Gunst said he did
not know.
"I suppose that some day Callundan
will be in the upper office, but in what
capacity I am unable to cay. He has con
siderable detective ability and. no doubt,
would prove a valuable acquisition to the
Police Department. If I were to remain a
Police Commissioner for a few months
longer I would make a number of other
chang-es. However, I am booked to go,
but will always take a great Interest in
the affairs of the Police Department."
Callundan admitted that he was anx
ious to become a member of the "upper
office" force.
"Whether they will make me chief of
detectives or not," he remarked, "I am
at a loss to say. It is true that I have
hopes in that direction, but whether they
will be realized I do not know. However,
I expect that when the new Commission
ers take their seats I will be made a de
tective."
It is authoritatively stated that Callur.
dan's appointment as a policeman is the
first step toward making him chief of the
detective department. He ha 3 a strong
backing and is liable to capture the plum.
Detective Kd Wren, who is one of the
shrewdest and most capable men in the
department, will give Callundan a hard
fight for the place. His many friends are
working In his behalf and are confident
of success. Wren enjoys the distinction of
having arrested more desperate criminals
than any other member of the detective
force.
By a unanimous vote of the Board of
Police Commissioners it was decided to
appoint temporarily Sergeant John T.
Grer-n as property clerk to take the place
of Captain Moran. who was retired on a
pension a few days ago. It is among the
possibilities that Green's appointment will
be made permanent to-day.
Under the impression that more vacan
cies existed in the department the Com
rrlpfioners at their meeting yesterday ap
pointed John M. Lewis and Robert Cock
rill sergeants of police and Thomas
O'Rourke corporal. It wae discovered a
short time after that all the vacancies
had been filled and the three last appoint
ments were withdrawn.
To-day the Commissioners will meet as
a pension board for the last time. It Is
understood that they will retire a num
ber of old officers, among whom are said
to be Sergeants Lindheimer and Brown
of the Central Station and Shields of the
North End Station. .-â¢
