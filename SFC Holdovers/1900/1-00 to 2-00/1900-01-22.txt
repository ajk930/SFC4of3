LONDON. Tan. 22.â Up to j
3 o'clock this morning no
tidings had arrived in Lon
don of the result of the battle 1
which, according to every indi
cation, raged all day yesterday on
Buller's left flank, where General j
Wp.rren in the morning had re
sumed his attempt to turn the!
Boers' right wing. On Saturday
the whole British force was en
gaged in a fierce conflict with the i
Boers ail day, which resulted in
thrusting back the Boers from
ridge after ridge. The fight was!
resumed yesterday and at 9:30)
o'clock General Warren had
forced the Boers from three posi- j
tions. The Lancashire and Irish j
brigades were then advancing. '<
That is as far as the dispatches
go.
The main engagement on Sat
urday took place to the west of
Spion Kop and resulted in the
British securing rough tableland
which is said to constitute the
key to the Boer position. The
Boer right was pushed back
upon the central hill, Spion Kop.
The British assault was delivered
against a ridge of hills six miles
long. The British forces were
marshaled in three brigades un
der Generals Woodgate, Hart
and Hildyard, General Clery di
recting operations.
The British moved forward
and gained position after posi
tion, until the Boer right cave
way. The flanking movement
was evidently entirely successful.
This collapse of the Boers' right
wing would enable the British
commander to swing around and
drive them into an ever narrow
ing circle.
Meanwhile the Boers were

MAFEKING. Jan. 10 (via Gabrones, via Lourenzo Marquez, Jan. 21.).â
The enemy continues the bombardment with field guns and an occasional
100-pound shell. They have again fired at the women's laager, but without
hurting any one.
MAFEKING, Jan. 6 (by runner to Moclendl, Jan. 14, via Lourenzo Mar

Nordonfeld and one little old ship's gun. on January 3. emplacing during
the darkness, so as to bear on the enemy's big siege gun. We carefully
conceals the pruns until the next afternoon, when, after the enemy had fired
a couple of shells, tie let loose all our pieces, firing and loading as fast as
possible.
One of our shots must have thrown the enemy's siege gun out of posi
tion, for it ceased firing. With glasses we could see the Boers rapidly re
inforcing that point.
The next day they moved back their guns 700 yards. They emplaced a
5-poundÂ«r and proceeded to drop shells regularly into Marquet Sqiiare.
We have made up our minds to stick It out, and -aye food for another
three months. The whole garrison is enraged at the enemy for firing upon
the women's laager.
LORENZO MARQUEZ. Jan. 21.â A dispatch from Gabrones. undated, says:

witzers. naval guns and field ar
tillery raked the trenches, keep
ing the Boers in them through
out the entire day.
The British commander and
his lieutenants have evidently
profited by their lessons in war."
There have been no desperate
rushes over open ground, swept
by fire from Boer marksmen.
There has been no marching in
close formation within range of
Boer volleys.
From Ladysmith comes word
that the Boers have placed in po
sition some new guns>and that
the bombardment has been vig
orously conducted during the last
few days. This apparently indi
cates that the Boers do not con
sider their prospects in Natal to
be hopeless.
General Warren seems to have
established himself at Acton
Holmes as an advance point, and,
being fairly behind the Boer po
sition and only twenty miles
from Ladysmith. he ought to be
in a good position to push the
Boers back upon the besieged
city, where General White ought
to have, in spite of the ravages
of disease, 9000 men ready at the
bayonet's point or lance point to
turn the foe off to the north.
This is one of the incidental
disadvantages of General Buller's
movement by the west, that it
throws. the Boers back on the
railway, the line of communica
tion to the Transvaal. This line
is studded with fine positions that
can be turned only from the east.
It may be part of the role as
signed to General White's forces
to prevent such a movement in
the direction of Helpmakaar and
Dundee.

LONDON, Jan. 22.â These advices from
its special correspondent are published in
the Daily Telegraph: ...
SPEARMANS CAMP. Saturday even
ing, Jan. 20.â That portion of General Bul
ler's forces which is under the command
of General Warren has fought a deliber
ately planned and successful battle. This
important engagement took place on the
west of SDlon ivod and has practically
resulted in our securing a rough table
land which constitutes the key to the
Boer position.
After a fierce cannonade had been di
rected against the enemy's lines for some
time, the British troops assembled near
an eminence known as Three Tree Hill,
which forms the center of a semi-circle
of crests, crowned with the enemy's
works, which are some six miles long.
Steadily and with great dash the Brit
ish infantry went forward in the face of
a heavy fusillade from Mauser rifles. Our
troops were disposed as follows: Wood
gate's brigade on the right. Hart's bri
gade in the center and Hildyard's brigade
en the loft.
Soon after midday the battle on the
hills became furious. From 3 o'clock In
the afternoon until 6 o'clock the fire of
both cannon and rifles was extremely
heavy. Point after point of the enemy's
positions was seized by the British troops.
Eventually the Boer right broke and was
forced hack toward Spion Kop. Our force
is bivouacking upon the ground they have
captured.
During the fighting to-day the enemy
brought Into action a few guns, one of
which was a quick-fire.
To-morrow ought to settle the matter.
In to-day's fighting our losses were tri
fling, but the Boers suffered severely.
While General Warren was fighting his
engagement an effectual demonstration
was proceeding at Potgieters Drift, the
enemy's positions near there being shelled
vigorously by the Britisn batteries.
During last night there was occasional
firing and this morning a heavy bombard

same time the guns of Warren's force
were heard.- .. .
Four more Boer prisoners, who are
slightly wounded, have been brought into
camp, making' the total so far captured
twenty-three.
FIGHTING THUS FAR AN
AFFAIR OF OUTPOSTS
LONDON, Jan. 21.â One : account of
Saturday's fighting says that the British
had- few' killed. Little reliance can be
placed upon these reports', and, although
the main position of the Boers has not
been attacked and nothing is known as
to its strength. Saturday's and" Sunday's
lighting, which can hardly be described
as more than outpost affairs, evidently
entailed serious losses.
The Beers are following their old-time
tacticsâ making. a show of resistance and
then retreating in good order to- pre
pared positions, and, as they are working
from the interior of their lines, they may
be able to bring strong forces to defend
the main position.
Nothing is heard regarding any counter
attack by Sir George White from Lady
smith, and General Buller's "I think we
are making substantial progress" re
mains the last word. This shows that
there is still some very hard work in front
of the British forces.
The Times has the following, dated Sun
day evening, from Spearmans Camp.
"All yesterday and to-day General War
ren has been attacking the Boers. Their
position is a long ridge four miles north
west of Richards Drift, ascending from
the river. At dawn on Saturday our
guns occupied a kopje on the east of the
range.
"The enemy's defenses were chiefly
stone sandgars extending forward and
right along the spur, making the posi
tion semi-circular. At 11 o'clock General
Hart's brigade advanced on the left,
along a rocky, uneven spur, into the semi
circle until he could lire from three direc
tions. Taking advantage of all possible
cover the troops advanced to a point
within 500 yards of the enemy's right
wing, but they did not advance beyond
the edge of the cover. There they re
mained until dark and bivouacked.
"In addition to Maxim-Nordenfeldts
the enemy fired shrapnel captured at
Colenso. Their fire was intermittent, and
was always temporarily silenced by our
masked batteries. At night the enemy's
right wing evacuated its position."
A despatch to the Daily News from
Potgieters Drift, dated Friday, January
19, says: ' -:/;;:,'
"The spirits of. the troops are greatly
raised by, the conviction that General Bul
ler now has a thorough grasp on the situ
ation. -As the force has left, the railway
transport difficulties are being experi
enced. The rivers are often flooded, and
what were a short time ago trickling
streams are now deep torrents.
"The scenes at the drift 3 cannot easily
bo forgotten. One sees a perfect pande
monium of ox wagons. Sometimes thirty
oxen are yoked: to a single wagon, and
the drivers make,, a veritable babel of
noise, shouting in Dutch, English and
Zulu. They, brandish their long whips,
and occasionally an upset stops a. whole
train. At another point or time half a
regiment will- drag a cart and Its mules
up the river ' bank by main force. The
traction engines looked promising at first,
but since Chieveley I have seen nothing 1
of them."
The Durban corresuondent of the Stand
ard sends the' following:
"It is reported that ten volunteer
stretcher-bearers, on their arrival at the
front, walked deliberately across into the
Boer lines. The same thing happened at
the battle of Colenso. It is presumed that
they were .spies who had succeeded in en
rolling themselves in the ambulance
corps. It is asserted that the Boers dese
crated the convent church at Newcastle
in an indescribable manner."

on his way to Pretoria, and called upon

courteous reception and requested him to

LONDON, Jan. 21.â The publication of
the fact that President Kruger is sending
a private car to take Webster Davis from
Lourenzo Marquez to Pretoria is causing
considerable speculation here as to wheth
er Mr. Davis, notwithstanding the dental
from Washington, has not some sort of
official mission. It is thought rather sin
gular that a simple traveler, even though
an official at home, should receive so
much attention. The subject is agitating
the Continental papers, which are inquir

whether the British Government has In

believe that one of President McKinl*y'q
assistant secretaries would take a vaca

pointed out that Mr. Davis had "given up

Believing his v.ife had been foully dealt

lowed the funeral to take place without
a murmur from him. Thero was talk
among the neighbors and Mrs. Darling's
father took the matter up. appealing to
Sheriff Gregory and District Attorney

quest was held on November 20, a post
mortem having been held the previous
day by Drs. Endicott and Gall. The jury
found that deceased came to her death as
a result of a criminal operation performed
by parties unknown. Notwithstanding dll
this the husband was not on hand to

CHAPELLE REQUESTED
TO REMOVE THE FRIARS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â A World special
from Manila says:
Monselgnor Chapelle. the papal delegate
to the Philippines. Is receiving many peti
tions from the natives, who. while declar
ing their allegiance to the Catholic church
and their enmity to Protestantism, ask
for a native priesthood and the expulsion
of the friars. A Spanish paper received
here last week contained the statement
that Monseignor Chapelle would support
the Dominicans, that Nozaleda would be
retained as Archbishop and that the
friars would be returned to their parishes
and supported by the United States Gov
ernment in the exercise of the same pow
ers they held under Spain. All this Mie
Spanish paper declared had been ordered
by President McKlnley.
This statement caused a tremendous
sensation, not only among the natives,
but among tho American troops. When
aÂ«ked about the matter Monseignor Cha
pelle said: "The statement is absurd. I
am engaged listening and learning, and
will announce my Intentions and decisions
later. I am convinced, however, that if
we were to leave the islands they would
fall Into a state of anarchy."
General Bates will soon return to the

WORDS OF CHEER FOR
STRUGGLING BURGHERS
Members of the American Congress Address
a Monster Pro-Boer Mass-Meeting
at Washington.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.-The Grand
Opera-house, the largest auditorium in
Washington, was packed to the doors to
night with an enthusiastic audience that
expressed its sympathy with the Boers in
their fight with Great Britain. Tho
speakers included members of both houses
of Congress, and on the ttage were other
public men, who came merely to add their
support. Tho keynote of the speeches
was that the Boers were fighting for their
Independence, as our forefathers had
done in 1776. The gathering assemble!
under the auspices of the United Irish
Societies, and a number of leading Ger
mans In the city joined in the movement.
The meeting was called to order by the
chairman of the executive committee, M.
P. T. Moran. the national treasurer of
the Ancient Order of Hibernians, who.
after a few words of welcome, introduced
Congressman Sulzer as the presiding of
ficer. Mr. Sulzer was greeted enthusias
tically. He said:
Ab an American citizen. I am not ashamed
to have It known that my sympathy is with
the heroic Boers In their determined effort to
maintain their homes and their independence
against the tyranny of the British crown.
In a. tizht between liberty and monarchy I
want to see liberty win.
Their cause is a just one. Encland's at
tempt to t-tenl their country is an outrage, an
act of criminal aggression and should be con
demned by the Christian powers of the world.
KngUnd must not be permitted to crush the
Boers and steal their horne 1 !. Her criminal
march of devastation must and will be
checked.
We must do our duty. This great republic. In
the name of liberty, humanity and free in
stitutions, must demand peace and make that
demand good. We have a right to express our
sympathy for the patriotic Koers. We have a
right to aid the Ked Cross Society In their be
half.
Senator Mason was first Introduced by
Chairman Sulzer. Said he:
I congratulate Washington, the capital of the
netlon, on this sympathetic demonstration in
behalf of a sister republic. The Boers are
right, but unless we can aid them in some
way their cause may not triumph. The bird
of liberty has hitherto always found a rest
ing plate in this country. Lately the American
people, it appears, have taken to eating carrion.
We do not want for the Boers the kind of lib
erty that England would give them. We want
the Boers to have the kind of liberty they
want. If yen have any influence lend your
voice to the cause of the Boers. If you have
no Influence but have convictions, Epeak your
sentiments.
Representative Bailey of Texas deliv
ered a vigorous address that was loudly
applauded. He said in closing:
I qm sick of hearing about our brothers
across the sea. England is brutal. It is not
merely Kngllsh greed of gold or desire /or
wealth that urges England on during this war.
She finds an opportunity to blot a republic
from the man of the world, and she does not
hesitate to do it. I blush to that there are
men under this flag who hope to see this crime
perpetrated, butthey hope in vain.
Senator William V. Allen of Nebraska
said In part:
A republic that will secretly connive and aid
a monarchy to destroy a sister republic and
blot out Its froe Institutions Is a republic rct
ten to the core and will soon fall like a de
cayed tree on the banks of a turbulent stream,
to be swept away forever.
The defeat of the BoerÂ« will be the severest
blow to republican Institutions that ha.s been
("truck in a century and overy lover of liberty
should fervently pray that they may be suc
ceprful.
There is no doubt thÂ» administration is b*
eretly in sympathy with Great Britain and
lending her all the aid it can. Kvery patriotic
citizen of the republic should condemn this.
Representative Champ Clark of Missouri
said:
The Senate cf the United States may laujrh
to scorn Senator Mason's resolution of sym
pathy with the Boers, but the tolling millions
of America will send their sympathy and their
hearty God-sDeed across the sea to the brave
hurchers who are the best marksmen eeen on
earth since Andrew Jackson's imomrtal day
at New Orleans.
A man cannot believe In the Justice of the
cause of the Boers and at the name time up
hold our Government's courne in the Phllln
pine?. The American flag will never wave In
triumph over the prostrate form of liberty.
Other speakers on the same general
lines as their predecessors were Kepre-
Kentatives lie Armond. Cochran, Rhea of
Kentucky and Lentz of Ohio, and Mr Van
Slcklen of New York. A number of letters
and telegrams were received. Including
one from Senator Hale of Maine, express
ing regret at his inability to be present
and entire (sympathy with the movement*
The following resolutions were adopted'

many warm frlonds among the better ele

the serious charge made against him, and
yet the facts as they appear from the
testimony adduced at the Coroner's in

lent himself to a crime that had resulted
in the death of Andrew Darling's young
wife.
Thpp? are circumstances in the case
which place the husband in an unenviable
light and strengthen the friends of Dr.
Giles in thfir belief in his innocence.

WOMEN TREATED
AS WILD BEASTS
Horrors of the Havana
Prison.
Special Difsatch to The CaM
HAVANA. Jan. 21.â The women's prison
here reveals a condition that Is immeas
urably worse than that which prevails
In the men's quarters. The women's
jirison is apart from the men's, bting in
unother part of the city. It has several
hundred inmates.
After Major Huncie and Colonel Dudley
finished their report on the carer 1 and
preKidio, they investigated the women's
prison. The place was utterly tilthy.
Sanitation was disregarded even in the
Havana sense of the word. There were
DO cots or blankets in the prison, and the
wretched inmates were obliged to sleep
on the stone floor. There was not a
woman attendant in the place.
The shamelcEsness of the whole prison
administration was shown by the fact
that women who had been confined for
more than a year had given birth to
childn n. This circumstance was known
10 thos*Â» cognizant of prison conditions,
but arouse*] no Indignation. The present
administration intends to wipe out this
disgrace.

AUTHOR OF "LORNA DOONE"
CALLED TO FINAL REST
RICHARD DODDRIDGE BLACKMORE. ;
LONDON, Jan. 21.â Richard D. Blackmore, the novelist, died to-day.
Richard Doddridge . Blackmore was probably best known as the author
of "Lorna Doone." and the charming book added greatly to his literary
success, which did not come until late in life. Blackmore was born In
Longworth, Berkshire, England, in 1525. He graduated from Exeter Col
lege. Oxford, and afterward studied law in the Middle Temple, practicing
his profession as a conveyancer.
In 1554-5 ha published several volumes of poems under tho norn de plume of
Melanter. These works, however, did not attract a great deal of attention, nor
did "The Bugle of tho Black Sea" and the complete translation of Virgil's
"Gcorglcs," which appeared in 1871. "Ix>rna Doone." his masterpiece, was pub
lished in 1563, but its popularity was of a very slow growth at first, which later
developed with great rapidity, as may bo evidenced by the fact that in IS7S twen
ty-two editions had been published.
NO FREE TRADE WITH

Open Door Policy Will Be Pursued by
This Country for at Least
Ten Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.âRepresenta
tive Payne's bill to extend the customs
and Internal revenue laws of the United
States over the island of Puerto Rico will
be considered by the House Committee on
Ways and Means during the present week.
The bill extending the revenue laws over
Hawaii is also to be advanced as rapidly
as possible. "II
It is not intended by Congress that any
of the Insular possessions of the United
States except Puerto Rico and Hawaii
shall be brought Into the revenue system
of the United States. The present policy
of the administration and of the leaders in
Congress is to have the Philippines per
manently retain their own tariff against
the United States and all other countries,
giving all other nations the same trade
advantages that are enjoyed by the Uni
ted States, in accordance with the "open

Spain the United States is obliged to
maintain this system for ten years at

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THEORIES ABOUT FOOD.
Also a Few Facts on the Same Subject.
We hear much nowadays about health
foods and hygienic living, about vegetari-
anism and many other fads along the
same line.
Restaurants may be found In the larger
cities where no meat, pastry or coffee Is
served and the food crank is in his glory,
and arguments and theories galore ad-
vanced to prove that meat was never in-
tended for human stomachs, and almost
make us believe that our sturdy ancestors
who lived four score years in robust
health on roast beef, pofk and mutton
must have been grossly Ignorant of the
laws of health.
Our forefathers had other things to do
than formulate theories about the food
they ate. A warm welcome was extended
to any kind from bacon to acorns.
A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow In matters
of diet, and a mixed diet of grains, fruits
and meats Is undoubtedly the best.
As compared with grains and vegetables,
meat furnishes the most nutriment in a
highly concentrated form and is digested
and assimilated more quickly than vege-
tables and grains.
Dr. Julius Ttemmeon on this subject says:
"X^rvous persons, people run down in
health and of low vitality should eat meat
an,d plenty of It. If the digestion is too
feeble at first It may be easily corrected
by the regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal. Two of these ex-
cellent tablets taken after dinner will di-
gest several thousand grains of meat, eggs
or other animal food In three hours, and
no matter how weak the stomach may be,
no trouble will be experienced If a regu-
lar practice Is made of using Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets because they supply the
pepsin and diastase necessary to perfect
digestion, and every form of indigestion
will be overcome by their use-
That large class of people who come
under the head of nervous dyspeptics
should eat plenty of meat and Insure its
proper digestion by the dally use of a safe,
harmless digestive medicine like Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets composed of the nat-
ural digestive principles, pepsin, diastase,
fruit acids and salts, which actually per-
form the work of digestion. Cheap ca-
thartic medicines masquerading: under
the name of dyspepsia cures are useless
for indigestion as they have absolutely
no effect upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia In all Its many forms is sim-
ply a failure of the stomach to digest food
and the sensible way to solve the riddle
and cure the dyspepsia is to make dally
use at meal time of a preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which is in-
dorsed by -the medical profession and
known to contain active digestive princi-
ples.
All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at 50c for full treatment.

thowing the imports at the port of

August and September last, being the first
official data relating to Imports during
t-o long a period since American occupa

The total value of merchandise entered

the aggregate of Imports up to $6,443.1)2.
or at the. rate of more than $23,200,000 a
year from Manila alone.
The growing nature of the trade is
shown by a comparison with the amounts
for all Philippine ports for the fifte3n

the average yearly imports of the archi

FINAL WEEK OF
ROBERTS CASE
Action to Be Taken in
the House.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2Lâ The feature
of the proceedings in the House this week
will be the consideration of the case of
Brigham 11. Roberts, the Mormon Repre
sentative-elect from Utah. The case has
attracted intense interest all over the
country. Though both the majority and
minority of the committee which investi
gated the case agree that Mr. Roberts
should not sit as a member of the House
on account of alleged polygamous prac
tices, there will be a royal struggle over
the question of procedure upon which the
committee has split. The case will be
called up on Tuesday and two, possibly
three, days will be devoted to It. The
majority of the committee hold that Mr.
Roberts should be excluded, while the mi
nority contend that he be seated and then
be expelled, basing their argument for
this course upon the ground that Mr.
Roberts possesses all the constitutional
qualities for membership and that any at
tempt to exclude him upon the theory
that Congress has the power to add to
those qualities would establish a danger
ous precedent that might return to plague
Congress in the future. Littletleld of
Maine and De Armond of Missouri, who
presented the minority report, will make
a strong fight, and say they believe they
can convince a majority of the House
that the course they advocate is the only
proper one to pursue. The majority of
the committee on the other hand are con
fident that they will be backed by a ma
jority of the House.
Mr. Roberts is expected to make a plea
in his own defense. Should he be seated
in accordance with the contention of the
minority, a resolution to expel w;ill be
Immediately offered, and this doubtless
will carry by an almost unanimous vote,
although the majority in their report
have insisted that once seated a member
cannot be expelled for acts committed
before he was a member of the House.
To-morrow will be devoted to District
of Columbia matters and Friday to eulo
gies upon the life and public services of
the late Vice President Hobart.
The Senate again this week will devote
tself almost exclusively to speechmak
ing. A variety of subjects will be cover
ed. The two reports on the Quay con
test will be presented Monday or Tues
day, and as this contest is a privileged
question, it is not unlikely to receive early
attention. Senator Penrose, who Is in
charge of Quay's case, says he will ask
that the contest be pressed to an early
decision in the Senate. The Samoa n
treaty also will be take nup again in ex
ecutive session on the motion of Senator
Jones of Arkansas to reconsider tho vote
on which It was ratified. The treaty has
been alrcadv returned to the Senate by
the President to await the presentation
of the Arkansas Senator's motion.

ALMOST STARVED TO
DEATH IN THE HILLS
Terrible Experience of an Italian
Who Lost His Way in Marin
County.
Â»** j â¢
Sp^ia.l Dispatch to The Call.
SAN* RAFAEL. Jan. 21.â Frank Bap
tiste, an Italian who says he came from
Fairfax, was found yesterday on the
Frcitez ranch, about six miles out Â«f
San Rafael, by iwo horsemen almost in
sane from lack of food.
Tom Cordner and Harry Boland. super
intendent and exercise boy of the Alta
stable, were riding over the hills tin
the Freitez ranch in search of stray
stock, when Boland's attention was
drawn to a figure on an -opposite range of
hills. The man was apparently attempt
ing to attract the rider's attention, and
Boland rode toward him.
W'lx i he was within a few feet of Bap
tiste the Italian rushed to his horse's
head. and. seizing the bridle, poured forth
a mingled stream of Italian and English.
HÂ« was t.-rribly emaciated, and his cut
and bleeding feet, torn clothes and gener
ally wild appearance Indicated that he
had been lost in the mountains and sub
fisted for over a week on berries and the
Lark of trees.
AJI Cordites and Boland could elicit
from him was the fact that he came from
Fairfax, was trying to reach San Rafael
and had wandered in the hills many days.
The two men took him to the ranch
house, where he was cared for, and later
brought into San Rafael.
It is thought that this may be the wild
man who has lately startled many who
have had occasion to travel the mountain
roads.

ed him. Vlnccnzo Spinella appeared on
the scone and a number of the Colletti

the cries of neighbors created a perfect
bedlam. When the police partol arrived,
and after the smoke had cleared away,
one dead and two mortally wounded men.

FRANKFORT, Ky.. Jan. 21.â The clergymen of Frankfort have decided that next Tuesday shall he set apart tn
this city as a day of humiliation and prayer. Clergymen of all denominations announced from their pulpits this morn
ing that the events of the last week In Frankfort and the continued talk of the possible repetition of such affairs had
rendered necessary some stress to awaken the public conscience to dangers threatening the commonwealth of Frank
fort. Three services will be held on Tuesday, at which prayers will be offered asking that men of both parties may be
guided to act with wisdom and moderation, and that the danger of further bloodshed may be safely passed by.
. Attorneys of both sides were busy all day preparing evidence to be submitted during the week.
The Republicans have decided not to place William T. Clark of New York on the stand.

THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
JJ â I ROM the conference called by President
I Wheeler to meet at the Hopkins Institute of Art
to-morrow evening to consider the proposed
establishment of a commercial museum in this city,
some definite plan providing for immediate action
may be confidently expected. The issue is not a
new one. It has been discussed by the press of the
I city and by the Merchants' Association, the Me
chanics' Institute and other organizations of a like
nature and is well understood by all who take an in
terest in it. There will be no occasion therefore for
any elaborate campaign of education.. Action may
begin as soon as a plan for undertaking the enterprise
can be formulated. . . - Â¦
â¢ The leadership in the conference which President
Wheeler has undertaken at the request of the trus
tees of the Mechanics' Institute is a good assurance of
success. In his inaugural address at Berkeley the
newly installed president showed his keen interest in
the commercial and industrial affairs of the State and
the city in what was said upon the subject of the
commercial college and the work it would have to
undertake in the development of the Pacific Coast.
Dr. Wheeler's relation to the movement therefore will
be that of a strong and earnest advocate and his
leadership will raise it from the degree of a mere mer
cantile venture to an enterprise of interest to the
I whole nation.
The success attained by the museum in Philadel
phia is an evidence of its value. Merchants and
manufacturers resort to it from all parts of the East
and letters of inquiry are received from every im
portant port or trade center on the globe. If such
an institution has been found beneficial in the East,
where the trade is mainly with European countries,
with whose people and commerce we are fairly
familiar, how much more beneficial will be a museum
specially devoted to the trade of the Orient, which is
as yet hardly understood?
The conference to-morrow evening ought to pro
vide the beginning of the work of establishing the
museum. The meeting was designed to be thor
oughly representative and if those who have been in
vited attend there will be present a body strong
enough to start the movement at once and bring
about its success.
THE STATUS OF TRADE.
I AST week was another good week in trade, as
j shown by the increase of 13.7 per cent in the
country's bank clearings and by the 235 com
mercial failures, against 262 during the corresponding
week in 1899. Thus far this year business has not ex
hibited the enormous gain over its predecessor that
1899 did over 1808. The gap between the failures is
tmalier and the gain in bank clearings less. Still,
when the immense trade of 1899 is considered, any
gain at all over that phenomenal year is gratifying,
es showing continued increase in business.
There is another point in these statistics. The ga:'n
in dearing?. unlike that in 1899. is not general. Dur
irz the whole of last year all the important cities ex
hibited a monotonous gain week after week, the ex
ceptions being few and far between. But this year
these same cities arc running irregularly. Thus last
week New York showed a loss of 22.5 per cent, while
St. Louis, Philadelphia and Baltimore also fell off.
The gain in Pittsburg, too, was comparatively light,
being only 19.5 per cent, against recent gains of 50,
75 and even over 100 per cent. This shows less boom
xn the iron and steel trade. Still, this line continues ac
tive, though chiefly on old orders, new business being
lighter than during the last half of 1899. Production
is as hard pushed as ever, but the fuel question is
giving manufacturers some concern. The West is
sending in heavy orders for steel rails, which points
to railroad activity in Chicago lines.
The other staples are reported strong, with some
increase in the demand. Cotton is quoted fraction
ally higher, with a good inquiry, which is ascribed to
better British prospects in South Africa. Wool is
likewise very strong and fine wools have now touched
the highest point in twenty years. Prospects for a
large domestic consumption, coupled with higher
prices in Europe, have vivified coffee, which is being
bought freely on speculative account. Lumber main
tains its strength, owing to smaller stocks in the
Northwest and indications of a heavy building de
mand during the coming spring. Cereals continue
disappointing, owing to the large supplies here and
abroad and wheat continues to decline slowly, though
corn and oats are showing more or less strength, the
former especially. The boom in boots and shoes
shows some signs of wavering. While shipments
from New England on old 'orders are heavier than
ever before known, it is said that new business does
not amount to a quarter of the production, and doubt
as to the maintenance of prices hinders buying.
Nevertheless, hides have recently awakened into re
newed activity and heavy sales have lately been made
in the East.
General distributive trade is. being affected by the
unusually mild winter in the East, but wherever
fpring trade has developed it has been in such
>o!ume and accompanied with such readiness to ac
cept high prices as to point to undiminished con
fidence in the future. The general demand is large,
but speculation seems to be declining in volume.
Money continues to ease off everywhere. The
Bank of England has again reduced its rate of dis
count, this time to 4 1-2 per cent, the lowest rate for
months. In New York call loans are now back to a
lower average than at any time since early autumn.
Supplies of funds for loaning purposes are steadily
increasing, and while lenders are disposed to put out
their money more freely and at lower rates, they are
also less critical as to the character of the security.
But the whole financial situation at the moment
hinges on the fortunes of the South African war. It
is the opinion, both in Europe and America, that a
serious British reverse would be likely to cause in
equally serious disturbance in the London market,
whi'e a British victory would immediately result in
easier conditions all around. So the financial world
is watching the movements of the opposing armies
with more than ordinary intereÂ«;t-
REFORM IN SACRAMENTO.
\A AYOR CLARKE of Sacramento has ren
/ \ dered an important service to that community
* by suppressing the exhibition of indecent
pictures in kinetescopes. The evil is one which
threatens every considerable city in the country, for
there is always a temptation to the exhibitors of such
shows to include among their pictures many which
will attract the lewd and vicious.
It will be remembered that not long ago The Call
found it necessary to expose the extent to which that
form of vice was carried on in San Francisco and
at the time of the investigation it was found that
many school children were in the habit of resorting
to such places. Something of the same kind, it ap
pears, has been going on at Sacramento, and the
Mayor's action is therefore one of the most important
which can be rendered to any community â that of
preserving youth from the enticements of the corrupt.
The vicious, like the. poor, are always with us.
They are forever aggressive in a sneaking way and
continuous watchfulness is necessary on the part of
public officials to prevent them from spreading their
traps for the unwary at every possible place of van
tsge. The indecent kinetescope is a novelty, but it
has taken its place along with the gambling room>,
the brothels and the dives as a means of affording the
predatory' classes a means of breeding vice and profit
ing by it.
That Sacramento has a Mayor vigilant and resolute
in his efforts to rid the community of such plagues
is a matter upon which the people of that city may
well be congratulated. Mayor Clarke is doing a good
work and it is to be hoped he will find among all
classes of citizens an earnest support in the work of
reform and improvement he has undertaken.

THE meeting of the executive com
mittee of the California Miners'
Association called by President W.
C Ralston for the evening of the
26th inst, at "the Palace Hotel espe
cially to consider miners' interests
in pending Congressional bills and the
conservation of forests and waters will
undoubtedly result in important action on
both lines.
The association has had much expe
rience and has achieved much success in
past years in securing Congressional leg
islation in behalf of the miners, and If
an energetic committee, provided with
what money is needed and having the
great prestige and influence of the asso
ciation behind it. gets the power It repre
sents to bear on Washington it will stir
up interest in pending measures and be a
strong force in pushing them forward
The most important measures pending
are those looking to the creation of either
a Cabinet department or department bu
reau to care for the mining industry, and
the mineral lands bill, which has been
fought for for years and which is still
stuck in the mud. The latter measure 13
the cne of most direct concern to Califor
nia miners, of most pressing, present Â»vn
portance, and the one in which most
active interest is taken.
The mineral lands bill, as all California
miners know, purposes to save from pat
| ent 10 railroad companies some millions of
! acres cf the remaining public lands in
California, which are chiefly mineral in
character though profitable mines are not
yet developed in them, and which are not
valuable for agriculture. To the railroad,
I which is getting patents to such lands by
Â¦ the thousands of acres right along, they
1 are valuable holdings for their timber and
f mineral resources, to be developed in the
j future. It has been the policy of the In
terior Department to regard such lands .-is
I agricultural unless valuable minerals
Â¦ have been actually discovered and proflt
j able cjuantiti^s proved to exist, and to put
; the burden of proof on the miner if pro
j tests happen to be filed. These lands. 61s
tributed ail through the mountainous
mining regions, hold the riches that the
! great mining development of the futUi^
I will reveal. They are the heritage of the
prospector and miner, and should be pre- ',
served for the mining industry to grow ;
on.
It is proposed that these mineral lands
be segregated by a commission and wkh
drawn from patent to the aided railroads,
I a? has been done in Montana and Idaho.
For years railroad influences have been
able to block all the many vigorous at
tempts of the California Miners' Associa
tion to secure justice for the miners, and
now the association will cross swords
with the railroad company once again.
President Ralston practically began the
fight himself many years ago, and he has
vigorously stood by it through all the bat
tles that have occurred since the asso
ciation took up the issue soon after its
organization, nine years ago. It was back
in the 'SO's, when Ralston was not the
general manager of a great mining prop
erty, but when, having energy and am
bition, he naturally decided to start a suc
cessful mining weekly. He started the
paper, and observing the constant land
slides of mineralized sections to the raU
road domain, he turned loose his heaviest
guns and stirred up an issue that lived,
though the valiant paper did not. The
fight troubled the railroad company, and
on one occasion, when C. P. Huntington
and Ralston met, the former said. "You're
a very fresh young man, Mr. Ralston."
Neither Ralston nor the association has
tired of the flght, and another campaign,
worthy of the hearty support of every
California miner and mining interest, will
soon be under way.
President Ralston wishes the advice of
the executive committee In the creation
and direction of the committee on conser
vation of water and forests provided for
at the last State convention, and the
creation of such a committee, which will
represent the association in this field that
has recently assumed bo gTeat importance
and life. This movement for the storage
of surplus mountain waters and the pres-.
crvatlon of the forests is of espectally
vital interest to the miners, and the ' Cal
ifornia Miners' Association will furnish a
powerful reinforcement to the new State
organization which is now seeking
strength, money and plans.
State Senator John F. Davis of Amador
County, who is one of the leading forces
in the California Miners' Association, has
taken much interest in the recent move
ment for better roads begun by the Cala
veras Miners' Association. . In a recent
article In the Calaveras Citizen he" has
written some vigorous suggestions that
apply equally to all the county miners' as
sociations.
"I would say," he observes "that the
two main problems that confront us in
the quartz-mining counties of the Mother
L,ode are: 1. That of obtaining a cheap,
continuous motive power; and 2. That of
good roads." Referring to the county as
sociation, he says: "This association can
be the nucleus of all public effort concern-
Ing anything I even remotely connected
with mining. It can. as part of the reason
for its existence, take up the problem of
continuous motive power, can affiliate it
self with the California Water and Forest
Association, or the California Association
for the Storage of Flood Waters, or the
San Joaquin Valley Commercial Associa
tion, and accredit delegates to those or
ganizations, and thus thoroughly Inform
the central organizations of the local con
ditions, in Calaveras County. The road
question is equally germane to the pur
poses of its organization. What we re
quire is a continuously active, live local
body; not an annual resurrection of a
dead one. Membership should be In
creased, meetings should be frequent and
in different localities, and constant cor
respondence should keep the members in
formed of what is going on in the associa
tion. The impulse should come from the
members to the officers and in that, way
thÂ« programme for public Improvement
developed and spread abroad."
Up in Northern California whole towns
are being swept away by the new flood of
mining enterprise and development that
has struck that region. Through Siskiyou
and Trinity counties are here and therG
little communities which have long been
sleeping In the sun on favorable' river
benches where they naturally grew along
the water courses in a country that Is
nearly all on the slant. After the pioneers
got through shoveling up the gold of the
rich early placers the country quieted
down and struggled along in an absent
minded way, with "occasional digging over
of low-grade gravel left, with a very lit
tle spasmodic quartz mining, with some
hydraulic mining in favored places and
with the vast network of rich quartz
veins under the pines practically unknown
and unsought.
Now, besides the booming development
of quartz mines from the Sacramento to
the sea, there is great activitiy in the
mining of vast deposits, of low-grade
auriferous gravel with hydraulic moni
tors and dredgers. Many river benches
above the present streams are extensive
deposits of ground that will pay to. work
by modern economical methods and with
sufficient capital. A good deal of money
is going into hydraulic propositions In
that big region and where a town is built
on golden sands the town must go. The
people know it and brag about it.
They wash out pans of dirt from the
street and astonish the tenderfoof with
the colors, and they wait eagerly for capi
tal to come in and wipe their towns oft
the face of the earthâ for so much a lot
as other towns want capital to build them
up. Old Trinity Center Is now being
sluiced into the river. Scott Bar In Sis
kiyou County thinks it hears the welcome
summons to oblivion. A French company
has been negotiating for the ground on
which it stands and, it is said, success
fully. When Scott Bar was a bar it was
rich and used to yield nine-pound nug
gets from the old channels, but it will
take a big hydraulic plant to work the
deep ground left unworked. Other town
sites have been similarly sold or negotiat
ed for, and it is even talked that Yreka,
the county seat, may be bought and
sluiced away in spite of the high prices of
property. The . town is built on rich
ground and would make a fine mining
proposition. . ,',;'.,Â»
A highly important point in the law of
mining locations, which has never been
before the Supreme Court of the United
BtateÃ. was recently decided by the
United States Court of Appeals in a
Southern California case. The Federal
mining law requires $100 worth of work
on a claim during the year after that in
which the location is made. The question
whether a State or district can legally im
pose additional assessment within a lim
ited time, has been a disputed one. In
this case the Court of Appeals has upheld
, this right, Judge Ross dlsaentlnr. Thft.
validity of the sixty-day and M require
ment of the lately repealed California,
statute is thus indirectly upheld, with
Judge Ross against It and the Supreme-
Court to be reckoned with in issues that
may arise under it.
The case alluded to is described and
1 commented on in an interesting way by
Attorney A. H. Ricketts as follows:
The United States Circuit Court of Appeals,
sitting at .San Francisco, has recently decided
In the case cf Northmore vs. Simmons, tnat
either a mining district or State has power to
make a regulation requlrins a prescribed
amount of work to be done on a claim witnin
ninety CM) days after its location, and to rnaxe
such claim subject to relocation in default or
such work, notwithstanding the ninety days
may expire before the first of January suc
ceeding the date of location.
Jud"e Ross dissented from the opinion of a
majority of the court, and hoids that not : a
single decision cited and relied upon in the
prevailing opinion, in his juiizme-nt, at an
supports the conclusion therein announce^.
and that the rule laid down by the S-uprerne
Court of this Ptate <in Original Company vs
Winthrop. SO Cai. 3Cl>. which is criticized and
disapproved by Judges Gilbert and Morrow in
the said opinion, is the true one. that suen a
rrtrulation is contrary to the plain meaning or
the statute cf the Cnlted Staf s and to- the
weight of authority. ,
This decision is the prevailing one and make*
it incumbent ui>on the locators of mining
claims within this State to strictly follow any
requirements of the local mining districts in
which the claim may bÂ» situated as to wr>rlc
to be done u;>on that claim, unless it be true
that the last Legislature effectively repealed
the State mining law of 1557. It would neÂ»m
that for safety locators of mining cl^im.*
should observe the Drovlslons o* the State
mining law. whether In fact repealed nr not.
as ultimately a court of la.=t resort may hold
that an a fact the State Legislature did not

AN AMENDMENT NEEDED.
OUT of the disturbance at the masquerade ball at
Mechanics' Pavilion on Saturday night comes
an illustration of one of the defects of the
charter. In the article relating to the Police Depart
ment it is provided in chapter X, section 12: "When a
request is made for regular policemen to be detailed
at any place of amusement or entertainment, ball,
party or picnic, the party or person making such re
quest shall first deposit $2 50 for each man so de
tailed with the property clerk of the department, who
shall give him a receipt for the same and' such sum
shall be at once paid into the treasury to the credit of
the police relief and pension fund."
The delect of the regulation is that it leaves it
optional with those who hold such entertainments
whether police protection be asked or not. The law
should be mandatory and require the managers of
public or semi-public entertainments to have a police
detail io preserve order and; keep the peace.
At the masquerade ball it appears the managers at
first undertook to conduct the affair without police
protection. Before the evening had fairly begun they
found themselves compelled to apply for six police
men. It is easy to perceive that the disturbance
might have grown to serious proportions and one or
more persons might have been dangerously injured
before the police came. In cases of prizefights the
danger of disturbance would be very great and there
is hardly less danger at public picnics.
The issue is not one that requires argument. That
clause in the charter should be supplemented by an
ordinance compelling managers of certain classes of
entertainments to provide police protection for their
patrons. It will be well to learn that lesson from the
experience of Saturday night and not wait for a
tragedy to teach it.

You heard his testimony on the witness stand. You are aware that less than two
weeks ago this man Esola was presented to you in Mayor Phelan's office by A. M. Law
rence as his candidate for Chief of Police. You' remember the meeting, the Mayor re
members it, Lawrence remembers it. On the witness stand, under oath, this candidate
for office at your hands swore he did not recollect anything about the meeting; swore
he had no memory of it; swore he could not recall meeting gentlemen of your official
position within two weeks.
Mr. Xewhall, do you believe that Esola told the truth when he swore he did not
remember meeting you? If you think he told the truth, do you believe a man with so
short a memory- for faces and for facts is fit to be Chief of Police?
Mr. Thomas, do you think a man who cannot rely upon his memory sufficiently
to testify truly concerning a meeting with you less than two weeks ago is a witness
whose word would be worth taking on any point where his interests were at stake? Is
he a fit man in your estimation to put into a position where accuracy of memory is so
essential to the performance of duty as in that of Chief of Police?
Mr. Bigg}-, you remember meeting this candidate for office; can you believe him
when he swears he does not remember meeting you? You heard his testimony on the
stand; did you at that time feel convinced that he was telling the truth? Did you think
him then, or do you deem him now. fit to be at the head of the police force in this city?
Dr. McXutt,' do you have any confidence in Esola's oath that he had no recollec
tion of the occasion when he was presented to you and your colleagues in the Mayor's i
office as Lawrence's candidate for Chief of Police? When you have heard him give cvi- ;
dence of that kind about a matter harmless in itself, can you deem him trustworthy in
anything? Would you ever be able to accept with full trustfulness any report which he
could make as Chief of Police?
These are the questions which the people will put to you, gentlemen of the Po
lice Commission, and they will not be satisfied with evasive replies. You are not called
upon to vindicate the Mayor, or Lawrence, or anybody else. You are to choose a Chief
of Police for San Francisco, and if after such testimony as Esola gave you select him
for that position the people will conclude your memories are shorter than his own, and
that you have forgotten what he swore to and what it meant and means.
j /""^ EXTLEMEX of the Police Commission, you have heard the testimony given in
\/n the hearing concerning, the fitness of Esola to be Â¦ Chief of Police of San Fran
cisco, and incidentally you have learned the truth of the charge made by The Call
that Mayor Phelan bargained that office away before the election in return for votes
and for newspaper support.
It is not for you to pronounce judgment concerning the conduct of the Mayor,
neither need you concern yourselves much about the bargains that were made and which
you were expected to carry out. The one issue before you is the selection of a Chief
of Police, and in meeting that issue you have to determine whether Esola is or is not a
fit man for the place.

TACOMA, Jan. 21.â The French have
won the boundary dispute at Kwong
Chanwan Bay by defeating the Chinese
troops in two more fights and preparing
to bombard Canton. The Pekin govern
ment has been compelled to accept the
French terms of i Â¦â¢ace as follows:
The leasing of Kwong Chanwan Bay
and extensive adjacent territory to
France; the dismissal of the Viceroy of
Kwantug and Kw.ngsi provinces: the be
heading of the Prefect who authorized
the Chinese to first fire on the French
troops and the payment of 200,000 taels in
demnltv to the families of the French sol
diers killed by tbe Chinese. Earl LI Hung
Chang has been sent to" Canton by the
Empress Dowager to succeed the dis
graced Viceroy and conclude the treaty
wtth the French commander. In the
meantime numerous armed bands of Chi
nese are parading through Kwong Chan

French soldiers, under three officers, r ere
sent Into the Interior to prevent further
hostile demonstrations. Several miles in
land they suddenly came face to face with
a large body of fully armed Chinese sol
diers. A sharp engagement followed and
the Chinese were beaten back. The
Frenchmen were then surrounded by an
angry native mob numbering thousands.
They fired Into the front ranks on all
sides and after over a hundred had been
killed and wounded the crowd broke and
ran. The French lost eighteen killed and
wounded and were two days getting back
to the warships. In the last fight three
companies of the French marine Infantry
charged against a large force of Chinese
regulars with' fixed bayonets, killing and
wounding twenty-two. After this defeat
the Chinese troops were willing to make
peace. "Â¦*Â¦"â¢'â¢Â¦-.' '

XI. RICHARD 111.
The English. Chronicle Play
When the first collected edition of
Shakespeare's playa â¢ was published, in
1623, the player-editors divided the dra
mas Into cormdies, histories and tn;e
dies. In so doing they recognized a
species of drama peculiar to their ageand
country. The history, or chronicle play,
wa3 a unique and distinctly English
branch of dramatic literature. As ColÂ»e
ridpe has said, it occupies an intermediate
place between the epic and the drama
proper. For :t was by no means a dra
matization of some episode cf the nation's
history, but rather an attempt to present
upon the stage within the brief compass
of an acting play the whole story of some
monarch's reign. This Is shown in the
very title? of such plays as the "Trouble
some Reign of King John" or the "lAt-z
and Death of Richard II." 'And for the
most part the early histories adhered
with a slavish fidelity to the chronicles
on which they were founded. They were
more careful to tell a true story than to
secure dramatic effect or to evolve dra-
thrse remind us of Marlowe, who, writ-
Ing for a simple ana uncritical audience,
made large drafts on their Imagination
an i cared little for verisimilitude so ha
could but accomplish his effect.
The Character of Bichard 11l-
There are other characteristics of this
play which show very plainly the influence
of Marloweâ the headlong energy of tha
action, the sonorous rhetoric of thÂ«
verse, the absence of rhyme. and
In a large measure of the fanciful
conceit* that disfigure much of Shako
speare's earlier work. But most
characteristic of all is the complete sub
ordination of the minor persons of thi
drama to the central character of Rich
ard. Marlowe loved a one-star play. With
the possible exception of "Edward" II" his
dramas are devoted to the exposition of
one great passion In one almost super
human figure. And not only does Richard
dominate, the other ftsrur^s in tha play
which bears his name: he is himself dom
inated by one master passion. thÂ» lust
of sovereignty. But in the evolution of
this passion Shakespeare works by subtler
menn3 than Marlowe ever dreamed of.
He Rivea it a background of history, ha
explains and humanizes it by heredity.
The passion, of sovereignty was an in
herited characteristic in thÂ» house of
York. Richard's grandfather had per
ished in an attempt
against his kin*;;
before the outbreak,
of the civil wars wo

Nature herself has
done her part to In
tensify and give di
rection to this pas-
TTT fion. She has mts
lil - shaped IFll chard
frnm his mother's
matlc character. That such chronicle
plays were popular among the Kllzaboth
an3 we have abundant proof. Beginning
with Bale's fiery polemic against pnpal
usurpation, the pre-Elizabethan play of
'Kinge Johan," a long line of histories
by Greene. Peele, Marlowe. Shakespeare,
Heywood, Webster, Ford, Dekker. Row
ley and a host of unknown authors cov
ers with hardly a break a period of Eng
lish history from the accession of John in
1100 to the defeat of the Armada in r>s3.
Of varying interest and far apart in the
scale of dramatic art, two characterist'.os
are common to all these plays â an exult
ant pride in the gloricus history of Ens
land and a sincere desire to instruct ar
English audience In the annals of the
past. Even such a reign of shama a?
John's is uplifted and glorined by the fig
ure of the Bastard Faulconbridge, the true
son of Coeur de Lion, whose lofty boast
"This Knelanri never did an<s never shall
Lie st trie i>rou<] Cft of a conqueror
But -ahen It first did help to wound Itselfâ"
Found a ready echo In the hearts of i
generation that had seen a united Eng
land shock into irremediable ruin the
worldwide monarchy of Spain.
The Authorship of This Play
There are nearly as many theories as
to the authorship of this play in both its
forms as there are critics who have inves
tigated the problem. So much, however,
is practically established by the concur
rence of later rritics that the "Thirl
Part of King Henry VI" is the joint work
of Marlowe and Shakespeare. And wheth
er the two great poets wrote in collabora
tion or separately, Shakespeare, as the
younger and less experienced playwright,
worked here In the spirit and under the
influence of Marlowe. What that Influ
ence was can be told in a few words.
Marlowe was the father, almost the cre
ator, of English romantic tragedy. He
adopted the "drumming decasyllabon" of
the would-be classical school of drama
tists, and. by changing it from a quanti
tative to an accentual metw, created the
mighty line which evoked the wonder of
his contemporaries, drove the jigging
rhymed fourteoners forever from the
stage, and, in the hands of Shakespeare
and Milton, became the organ voice of
England. At the same time, since he
wrote for the public of the playhouses and
not for the learned society of the court
or university, he took up the popular
drama of action rather than reflection,
cleared it of clownish conceits and sub
stituted living, breathing men for th<Â»
automatic puppets- that had clattered
about the stage. It is in Marlowe's plays
that we find, for the first time in modern
tragedy, character and character devel
opment. In short, he breathed into the
crude and formless drama of his day his
own fiery self, a rare compound of poetry
and passion. At the feet of such a master
â¢yen the young Shakespeare, with all his
consciousness of coming glories, might be
well content to sit.
That Shakespeare, almost at the begin
ning of his career, came under the influ
ence of Marlowe, is undeniable. His own
natural bent was toward rhyme, and the
linked sweetness of "Venus and Adonis"
shows us how perfectly the young poet
had caught the secret of rhyming meas
ures. Rhyme occurs at frequent intervals
in most of Shakespeare's early plays, and
it was only a long apprenticeship in Mar
lowe's school that led him to exchange It
for blank verse. This apprenticeship ex
tends over a considerable portion of
Shakespeare's early work. "Titus An
dronicus" was perhaps written by Mar
lowe himself, it Is certainly a play of his
school; and this' drama was retouched by
Shakespeare's prentice hand, it is by no
means unlikely that Marlowe was one of
the collaborators In "I King Henry VI."
to which Shakespeare afterward added
the scenes of the quarrel in the Temple
gardens and of Talbofs death, "the last
and loftiest farewell note of rhyming
tragedy." Marlowe's work and Shakes
peare's* appear side by side in the second
and third parts of "King Henry VI," and
Marlowe's' most finished play served as a
model for Shakespeare's "Rivhard II."
"Richard III" a Play of Marlowe's
Vi School.
Nowhere Is Marlowe's Influence over
Shakespeare plainer than in "Richard |
III." So apparent is it. indeed, that Mr. ;
Fleay believes that Shakespeare derived j
not only his plot but a considerable part
of his text from an unfinished play on the
same subject by Marlowe. This is a hy
pothesis that we are by nd means called
on to accept. We may rather say with
Swinburne that "this only of all Shakes
peare's plays belongs absolutely to the
school of Marlowe." Marlowe had blocked
out the character of Richard In the "true
tragedy"; Shakespeare had already added
to and developed it In the "Third Part of
King Henry VI." And then while still
under the master's Influence Shakespeare
undertook a further and independent
treatment of the same theme and execut
ed it with a dash and subtlety that raise
It far above his master's best work. Pro
fessor Wendell has pointed out certain
archaic elements In the play, the Improb
ability of Gloster's wooing Anne in the
open street, the choral lamentations of
the widows In the fourth scene of the
fourth act. and Richard's frank avowal
of his villainy in thjs opening unsa. All
womb, "like to a chaos or an unlicked
bear-whelp." Not that Richard is a vil
lain because he is a monster of deform
ity. The frequently misunderstood lines

Are not ?r>oken in earnest, but in the
spirit of mocking Irony which is so char
acteristic of Richard. It cannot be seri
ously maintained that Richard became a
hypocrite, a perjurer and a murderer be
cause he could not play the lover and
"strut before a wanton ambling nymph."
But the bodily deformity which cut him
off from the delishts of love and tha
friendship of men steeled his heart and
steadied his hand to the accomplishment
of hi 3 Inherited purpose. He is not embit
tered against mankind because of his de
formity: he gladly accepts it as a tlnger
mark of destiny. If he was born with
teeth it plairly signified that he- "should
snarl and bite and play the dog." He rev
els in allusions to his misshaped form,
and exaggerates It with the habitual
jocularity which Lamb points out as a
prime feature of his character. The samÂ»
subtle critic has shewn how in these al
lusions thera mingles a perpetual refer
ence to the powers and capacities by
which Richard is enabled to surmount
his bodily deformity: the Joy of a defect
conquered or turned into an advantas*
is the cause of these very illusions and
of the satisfaction with which his mind
recurs to them.
Nowhere are these powers and capa
cities so magniflclently displayed as in nis
courtship of Anne. The scene Is not un
commonly condemned as a piece of Ellz
bethan extravagance, a reckless defiance
of the possibilities of nature. That such
a monster as Richard could win tho love
of a princess, lately widowed by his dag
ger, take her In her heart's extremest
hate," over the very body of the saintly
king whom he had murderedâ this, say
the critics, 13 a fiat Impossibility. But
such a criticism misses the central point
of the scene. Richard docs not win
Anne's love; he overwhelms her reason,
till she falls Into his arms as the bird,
into the jaws of the serpent. Just be
fore she meets him she has unpacked her
heart of curses, so that she Is disarmed
by the very violence of her emotion.
Richard, on the other hand, comes to her
in the full tide of success. Regarding thÂ«
throne as already attained, he has chosen
Anne as the most fitting partner of the
throne. He realizes fully the obstacles In
his path. anÂ«J to overcome them every
energy Is strained to the utmost, and his
amazing powers of dissimulation and
hypocrisy are brought Into full play. lie
stops the pallbearers with a rude. Imperi
ous gesture, overwhelms Anne with a
flood of flattering terms, and finally pro
claims his desire with a blunt frankness
which the prudery of some editors cuts
out of the text, to the hitter loss cf
Shakespeare's meaning. He calmly con
fesses the murders with which Anne
charges him. and with superb effrontery
lays the guilt at her door.
"I did kill Kins Henry.
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked irsÂ«.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twa* I that killed yotra*
E.lwarrt. \.
Eut 'twas thy heavenly fare that set me on."
If she treasures resentment let her slay
him: here is his sword, and here his
naked breast. Or let her say the won!
and he will ex<Â»rute her vengwinee upon
himself. She hesitates. "I would I knew
thy heart." and Is lost. Not a word of
love falls from her lips, but her resistance
is beaten down and she leaves the seenÂ«
Richard's affianced bride. The whole
scene Is an exhibition of the devilish
power of a tremendous will over a -weak
and emotional nature; to-day we call It
mesmerism, hypnotism, any scientlfto
term you will. To Shakespeare it waa an
Instance of the might and mystery of
evil, the problem over which he wai to
struggle ?o sorely in his later years.
In this scene are embodied all thÂ«
characteristics that carry Richard so tri
umphantly to the throrjp â his fiery en
ergy, his intellectual ascendency, his pro
tean power of assuming whatever shapo
he will, and his biting scorn of the poor
victims of his craft. All these sprlnr
from his own marter-passlon. the lust of
Fovereignty. and are its instruments for
the attainment of the goal.

REV. JAMES C. MacINNES'
withdrawal from the ecclesias
tical ranks for the alleged reason
that to be a minister cf tho gospel
cne must be a hypocrite, has created
a storm of indignation, among the
clergymen cf the State. Ail condemn
the views expressed by the ex
preacher, -with the exception of the
reverend gentlemen with whom ho
associated in Oakland. They take a
more liberal view of the matter and
speak cf Mr. Maclnnes' action in a
spirit cf sympathy and sorrow rather
than anger.
Judging from the expressions cf
the clergymen of this city, they look
upon Judas as an angel in comparison
vrith the ex-divine who holds to the
opinion that it is legitimate for
preachers cf the gospel to tipple if
they feel they need it and strictly
within the psle of propriety for doc
tors of divinity to dance if they are
inclined that way.
The statements which follow, ex
pressing the opinions of some of tlie
mest prominent clergymen of this
section, give a hint cf the fierceness
cf the storm that is hovering over
the head of Rev. Mr. Mclnnes.
JUDAS AN ANGEL

think it betrays a very boyish idea of joy.
The trouble with Brother Maclnnes, how
over consecrated he may have once been,
is that he has pot into the coils and im
agines that everybody is like himself.
Maclnnes' outline of his own life shows
that he. is an extremist and not a stand
ard by which to measure others."
ONE STANDARD
IS SET FOR ALL
Rev. John Hemphill, Calvary Presby
terian Churchâ "Every utterance ascribed
to Mr. Maclnnes is incorrect and has a
false ring of insincerity to it. In my church
there is not one standard for the
minister and another for a member. The
cne standard of a good life governs both.
"Regarding the assertion of Mr. Mac
lnnes that "if a man needs a drink he has
a. right to take it' I must say that I dis
agree with him. I stand with Paul, who
says: Mf by eating and drinking he
caused a weak brother to stumble or fall
he would do neither one nor the other as
long as the world' lasts.' So many are
driven to the devil by the drink habit
that 1 do not drink myself. A minister
should be a man among men. and should
maintain the dignity of the profession to
which he has consecrated the best that is
in him.
"I do rot agree with Mr. Maclnnes that
the church is full of hyprocrites. There
are some, no doubt, but they are rather
the exception than the rule. The fact that
Rev. W. E. r>uffa:i of Stewart Memo- |
rial Church takes no stock in Rev. Mr. |
"a'-Jr.nes' visions of Christian hypocrites, j
He Eaid:
'"Is the church full of hypocrites? No.
The fact that there was a vile Judas ]
among the twelve original apostles did
not prove that the other eleven were hyp
ocrites. The fact that the Rev. Mr. Mac
lnnes ha? found that his own heart is j
r.ot right with God docs not by any man- i
Tier of means prove that all members are j
hypocrites. The fact that Brother Mac- J

of genuine Christians.
"\W do not contend that preachers or

company of anjcls by any means, but
while imperfect, they are for the most
pan siru-^re. The id^a that a minister i

for which he must leave the ministry, I j
there are hyprocrites only goes to show
that on the other hand there are con
scientious Christians, just as a spurious
coin is proof that there are genuine coins
in existence.
"It was Maclnnes' God-given right to
leave the rhurch if he so desired, but his
reasons for leaving are exceptionally
weak. If the churches were all burned and
the Sunday-schools discontinued the coun
try would go back to barbarism in fifty
years or less as a result of the destruction
of the good Influence exorcised by Chris
tianity. It is possible that the churches
fail to do all the good that they might
do. but it is certain that we could not
very -well do without them.
"1 believe tha.t the only reason Mr. Mac-
Innes had for leaving the ministry was
as be expressed it himself, that 'he con
sidered himself better equipped for a busi
ness than a religious career." He ens
piays exceeding bad taste to ascribe his
withdrawal to any other cause than that
of his evident unntnys for the ministry."
GLAD HAND IS
NOT IN FAVOR
Rev. A. J. Well?, Second Unitarian
Churchâ "The Rev. Dr. Maclnnes has
either spoken unadvisedly with his lips
or. If his speech represents his convic
tions, has mistaken his calling.
"There Is need of "personal liberty' In
the pulpit, but no man need mistake
license for liberty, nor question the
'right' of a man to take a drink if he so
desires. If he wants to slap a fellow man
on the back and say 'Hello, Bill,' he is
perhaps at liberty to do it In some quar
ters, but hÂ» must not blame the public
for questioning culture behind the exuber
ance. I do not think It is the province of
EVIDENCE OF BROTHERLY LOVE.
RE\ . T\. S. T_RMY, First M. E. Church: "I consider the former
Rev. J. C. Maclnnes to be in the same class with those 'sinful hypo
crites' which he designates as 'frauds of piety," for he is the biggest
freud of them all. He lies ar.d he knows he lies when he says that it is
necessary for a minister of God to be a hypocrite and overlook hypocrisy
:i others in order to be successful. There was at least one hypocrite in the
Â¦r'.gir.ai twelve apostles 'and we must take it for granted that this propor
tion v. lll be maintained until the end of lime. But this should not make
ithers turn away from Christ and Christianity. The church is dealing with
hese very hypocrfites and endeavoring to instill in them a purity of mind and
in honesty of purpose.
"I take it that the ministry Is well rid of an Individual like Mr. Maclnnes.
R-ho holds such false ideas as are attributed to him. He never should have

IMPRISONED
IN II TUNNEL
Lives of Eleven Work
men Endangered.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21.â Shortly after
11 o'clock this mornlnj the west end of
what is known as the Third street tun
nel, which is under construction between
Hill and Hope streets, a distance of three
blocks, caved in and entombed eleven la
borers and bricklayers, and fatally in
jured, W. T. Lambie. an inspector in the
employ of the dtreet Department.
The entombed men are: John Mohn and
John Eckhart, bricklayers; Frank Pelas
seer, John Mitchell, William Paully,
Kimberley. Max Costello, Baden, John
Bejoe, J. W. Washburn and Bert Garrett,
laborers.
Work on the tunnel is being done by
contract. In order to hasten its construc
tion a force of men is employed Sunday.
The men were engaged this morninig ex
cavating 175 feet from the mouth of the
tunnel, when the entrance, which had
been timbered up for a distance of 2S feet,
was suddenly choked by tons of
earth and broken timbers. The timbers
were defective and insufficient to support
the great, weight, and the accident is thus
accounted for.
Inspector Lamb was in the act of leav
ing the tunnel when the cave-in occurred.
Three feet from the entrance there stood
a nail keg, which at least temporarily
saved his life. He was Â¦ borne to the
ground by the falling earth and timbers,
one of which made a bridge from the
ground to the nail keg. over the upper
part of his body, giving him sufficient
breathing room until the rescuers un
earthed him. His lower extremities,
however, were pinned down, and it was
eight hours before he was extricated, and
then in a dying condition.
Twenty-eight feet from the entrance to
the tunnel, which has been sunk to a
depth of 175 feet, the roof is bricked over
and it is not thought that any of the
entombed men were killed. The tunnel
Is 28 feet high and 26 feet broad and con
tains sufficient air to keep the men alive
for a number of hours. A shaft Is now
being sunk through the roof of the tun
nel for the purpose of admitting more
fresh air, and the entombed men can be
heard digging for liberty b>\ the scores of
shovelers who are working form the ou
side. Barring accidents, it is thought the
imprisoned men will be liberated In the
course of twelve or fifteen hours.
Two deaths have already occurred In
this tunnel by previous cave-ins.

the church company was the best ho ever
trained with. The thing he boasts of be
lieving in. unfortunately, has long been
marked as dangerous by human experi
ences and observations, independent of
church teaching. It seems like a work
of supererogation for a gentleman who
has spent ten years in the ministry, for
which he never had a conviction to turn
from it in a spasm of virtue and denounce
all his brethren as hypocrites. They
might, with some show of reason, inquire
in what light he regarded himself during
that time."
Maclnnes does not think his place Is in
the church he is very wise to leave it."
Rev. Dr. R. F. Coyle. pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church, expresses
sorrow that any man should take the
position of Mr. Maclnnes. "I have only
this to say." remarked Dr. Coyle. "This
young man hasn't left the ministry any
too soon if he holds the opinion reported.
The ministry is no place for a man who
will take that attitude. I really don't
remember much about this affair, but I
am very sorry that any man in or out of
a church should take such a position."
HE FACED SOME
HARD PROBLEMS
Rev. W. W. Scudder, Alnmeda Congre
gational Church: "Mr. Maclnnes must
have had a very unfortunate experience
to make such wild charges. His reasons
are very trivial and based upon a strange
conception of the ministry. His reasons
are two. the principal of which is that
self-repression is hypocrisy. It may and
it may not be. If Mr. Maclnnes, enjoy
ing wines and dances, decided that by giv
ing those up he could serve his God and
his congregation, men would honor him
for hie self-denial and not call him a
hypocrite. Paul did not consider himself
a hypocrite because he gave up the meat
that offended those he was trying to hep.
When Mr. Maclnnes sells his first bill of
goods to an elderly merchant he will re
press that natural feeling to Flap him on
the back and say, 'Hello, Bill.' Will he
/Call himself a hypocrite for his discre
tion? Every noble work in the world calls
for courteous self-repression. 'The church
is full of hypocrites." Mr. Maclnnes must
know a good deal, for 'full' is a large
term and hypocrisy a severe one. Ti:e
church is full of imperfect people, that
MacINNES MADE
TWO MISTAKES
REV. E. A. WOODS, pastor of
the First Baptist Church, re
ferred rather tartly to Rev.
Mr. Maclnnes as follows: "I
never had known of Rev. Mr. Mac
lnnes or his work until my atten
tion was turned to his statement
in The Call. From that statement
I should infer that he made his
first mistake in ever entering the
ministry and his second in not go
ing out of it long before he did.
That he was ordered from his
home when he was but 14 years
of age by a furious father, who
never recognized him again be
cause of his childish choice of a
profession. Is a statement which
should be taken with a grain of
salt. That there may be hypo
crites in the churches and in the
ministry I have no doubt. There
was one Judas among the twelve
disciples."
a minister of God to be a 'hale, fellow well
met," nor do I hold that a minister should
be 'solemn- visaged' always. I do believe,
however, that he should never do a single
act that would abate one jot or tittle of
the dignity becoming his holy office.
"The churches have their faults, but I
have no occasion to arraign them for
hypocrisy. Ministers are human and
fallible, but a long acquaintance with
them in many fields leaves me with a pro
found respect for them as noble and self
devoted men. Mr. Maclnnes is evidently
unsettled a little by the prevailing revo
lutionary spirit of the age. and, therefore,
should be forgiven for the false position
he has assumed."
must be dealt with most patiently. Have
I a right to call a man a hypocrite who
does not use his wealth just as I would
and whose social and political ideas and
course are not just like mine? If he is
wrong I try patiently to help him see it.
Am 1 a hypocrite for seeming to over
look much and for not denouncing him
from the pulpit?
"I think Mr. Maclnnes a sincere, hon
est man who has run up against some of
the hard problems that call for n patient
treatment. That is a good deal like self
crucifixion, and which every minister
must bear; and he has become disheart
ened. The older he grows he will see that
life cannot be cut out into square blocks
by his square of justice.
"Hypocrites? Yes. The church has
these. So has every good thing. Christ
predicted it. He kept silent three years
with a Judas in the camp, nor did he
leave his ministry because Judas was
there. But they are not as thick as Mr.
Maclnnes thinks, and his refuge does not
seem to be a complete one. There are
some hypocrites left /still in the mercan
tile profession."
WAS TARDY IN
HIS DISCOVERY
Rev." John A. B. Wilson, pastor of the
Howard M. E. Church said: "All I can
say In the case of Rev. J. C. Maclnnes,
as he is reported in The Call, is that he is
a man who had mistaken his calling and
has done the right thing in getting out
of a false position. If he expected to find
perfection in church members or in his
brother ministers, that was his misfor
tune. But, with all their faults, he will
look back in after years and admit that
HAS NO MONOPOLY ON SINCERITY.
THE reasons given by Mr. Maclnnes for leaving the ministry are not only
inadequate but a reflection upon the church, and not alone the church
but on Mr. Mclnnes. They are these:
A minister who cannot stand the disclosures of human nature will
never make a great success. Neither will he make a car conductor, a
lawyer, a doctor or a newspaper man. There is a strain of pessimism in
Maclnnes. He has lost faith in humanity, the worst of all mental disasters.
It is a sad sight to see a bright young man like Mr. Maclnnes run away from
life and Jumping out of the frying pan of the ministry into the fire of busi
ness.
The members of the church do not want a long-visaged pastor; they want
a manly man, a gentleman, a man who believes in God and also in propriety,
and above all one who believes in man. If there are hypocrites in the church
the greater the reason for remaining in the church. A man must not be a
hypocrite in order to remain in the ministry. Such a statment slanders the
pulpit. Mr. Maclrnes is not the only honest man in the ministry. He has not
a monopoly of sincerity. WILLIAM RADER..
OAKLAND FILLED
WITH SYMPATHY
Over in Oakland, where Rev. Mr. Mac
lnnes ts most widely known, the clergy
men epeak of his repudiation of their
calling more in sorrow than in anger.
The opinions of some of them are ap
pended:
Rev. C. R. Brownâ l am surprised at
the remarks attributed to Mr. Maclnnes.
He was a warm personal friend of mine,
and it seems strange that he would say
anything of the sort. lam surprised and
sorry.
Rev. Mr. Maclnnes finished a course of
special studies at tbe Ducific Theological
Seminary in Oakland atfout a year and a
hnlf ago, and Dr. J. K. McLean, president
of that Institution. speaks In trio-wing terms
of the young ex-minister. "1 cannot
imagine what has come over Maclnr.es."
said Dr. McLean. "He was always so
gentlemanly and modest, and withal a
most earnest student. He is a college
graduate, widely read, and was selected
as one: of our best- student?. At Benicla.
where he formerly preached, he was well
liked. I am surprised that he should say
anything like those statements accredited
to him. fox he was never a blatherskite.
"I know that he has stated thai he did
not think on the whole that he was fitted
for the ministry.
Rev. Dr. B. R. Dille. pastor of the First
M. E. Church of Oakland, was also very
well acquainted with Maclnnes. "From
what I know of him." said Dr. Diile, "I
would hardly credit those statements as
coming from him. He was very active in
Christian Endeavor work. â¢. He spoke very
effectively in my church during the
Christian Endeavor convention. It is cer
tainly all a great surprise. I thought
Maclnnes was a young man of unusual
spirituality. He surely must have taken
some very strange freak if this is all
true of him. Of course. I would like to
give him every benefit of a doubt; but if
he did say these things he is very wise in
going out of the ministry."
Rev. C. H. Hobart. pastor of the First
Baptist Church. Oakland, takes this view:
"This is a free country, and a man has a
right to change his religious views when
ever he sees tit. The general principle in
this country of a man believing according
to the dictates of his conscience I hold
strenuously as being inviolable. If Mr.

BOHE PROVES
OF WORTH AS
A GREYHOUND
Wins the Open Stake at Union
P^rk Brilliantly From
Royal Flush.
After a day* coursing replete with inci
dents J. 11. Perig-o's Bohc, by St. Law
rcnce-\\>e Lassie 11, won the open stake
yesterday at Union Park. In the lina!
t=hc mci Frank McComb's Koyal Flur>h
and s-hut him out pointless, the Fcore be
ing 6-0. This outcome was expected, as
the big black dos had been throuph some
dosperate running; and in addition had
â¢sustained a bad fall. BohÂ«*, on the other
hand, had been fortunate, the majori:y
of her trials being t=horu She dofeat.-d
Depend On Me, i-0; Flying Fox, 4-0; then
Â«njoyod a bye course; beat Hawker, >>-0;
1-a.dy Clare. C-l. and then met Royal
Plush for the all-important final.
The most sensational course of the day.
and one of tjie most remarkable ever seÂ«n
on the field, was between tho stake fa
vorite. Beacon, and Royal Flush. The
d^gs ran one minute and forty-four sec
onds. Royal Flush winning by a score of
I*^ to 12. The rice* showed equal speeJ to
the hare, whldi for ;i time favored Flush.
Beacon was showing the advantage wlien
he stumbled and buried his long mu/.r.le
In the earth. The blow stunnrd him and
he diii not recover quickly. Flush then
fell, leaving the result in doubt for a
time, but hf finally wÂ«.n. Judge Grace
pronounced Beacons fall one of the se
verest he had ever seen <>n the field. Flush
ran a bye with his kennel mate Mntto in
the next round and won, although Motto
was ir.stalkd favorite.
The coursÂ«> between Lucky Dog ana
lowa Maid resulted in a scene seldom
Â¦witnessed :n the coursing field. The brace
of dogs were not sighted on their game
and overran the hare. The latter hexi
tated a moment and then followed the
Â«3ors at top Bpeed. It presented the odd
ppertacle of running into the very jav.s
or death. When the dog? missed their
prey they slackened their speed, and then
Eighties the haie quickly dispatched it.
Beacun ran a sensational course with
the phenomenally fast Lucky Dog. The
hare favored Lucky Dog ami he had the
pcore t; to a in his favor when he weak
ened, allowing Beacon to score a turn and
tbe kill which gave him the course.
In the sapling stake T. J. Cronin's re
cent purchases. Vandal and Vixen, ran
cur, two. dividing tirM and second money.
The day was cold and cheerless, but the
attendance was large ar.d the quality of

Columbia Club Shoot and
Monthly Medal Conests
at Schuetzen Park,
Three clubp occupied the shooting boxes
at Bchuetzfn Park yesterday and en
joyed excellent sport. Owing to the bad
light on the targets only fair scores were
recorded. A noticeable fact was the man
ner in which the fog lay banked around
the point on which the ranges are situ
ated, but failed to interfere with the
shooters' aim.
The bullseye shoot of the California
Schuetzen Club resulted as follows:
11. Ens*>, M 6; Pliilo Jacoby, 634; A. Hampel,

The Coluumbia Pistol and Rifle Club
members held their regular semi-monthly
meeting yesterday at Harbor View ran^e.
The atendance was good. Several new
shots have joined the ranks of this club,
and there is every prospect that the tar
get accommodations will have to be in
creased. The weather conditions were
not favorable for good scores, but consid
erable shooting was done. It will be re
membered that on the last shoot no rifle
class medal scores were shot on account
of the target pits being flooded oy tne
rains, so those events were shot yester
day. The scores of the day were as fol
low:

READY FOR
THE DOG
CONTESTS
High-Class An'mals to Com
pete in the Bakersfidd
Field Trials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 21.â The seven
teenth annual trial of the Pacific Coast
Field Trial Club will open to-morrow
(Monday) morning. All of the train
ers have completed their work and have
reached Bakers Held with their strings of
dogs. The visitors have not put in their
appearance as yet in great numbers, but
a large delegation Is expected on to
night's train. As the southbound train
does not reacn here until about 10 p. m.,
if on time, the drawing for the members'
stake will take place to-morrow at 8
o'clock.
The weather still remains very disa
greeable, although it was colder to-day
than it has been for the past week. The
kennel men are anxiously waiting for
warmer weather and sunshine, as under
these conditions the birds will work much
better. and t tie trials will be more interest
ing a.s well as comfortable for those in at
tendance. One or two of the members
who visited the trial grounds to-day re
port plenty of birds.
Much credit is due to the president of
the club, W. S. Tevis, for the care taken
of the grounds, both as regards keeping
off stock and preventing poachers trom
destroying the birds. He has a patrol
man constantly in attendance, whose
business it is to see that there is no
shooting, and as the birds have remained
undisturbed throughout the season it la
believed they will be more plentiful than
last year.
The dogs generally are in excellent con
dition, and. it is claimed, are a much
higher class lot both in the derby and all
age than was seen last year, and there is
apparently nothing to prevent a most
successful field trial.

THE live-mile barge race between
the Alameda seniors and the rep
resentatives <>f the South End
Rowing Club touk place yesterday
on Oakland estuary :*nd resulted in
a victory for the Alamrdans in the
good time of '^" mm. 40 tw. The oarsmen
from San Francisco and their friends left
the city by the 10:l"> boat and were met
on the narrow-pane mole by the secre
tary arid others of the Alameda Boat
Club. The senior crew, however, were not
on hand, but came down later. The South
End mÂ»n put on their rowing attire, with
broad alternate stripes of white and red,
ai;.d got i.Uo their four-oared barge, which
had been towed down the creek by a
launch. At 31:30 the crews were started
by J. T. Sullivan, the Alamedaa almost
Immediately paining a length. This ad
vantage they retained and increased grad
ually throughout the race. leading at one
time by half a. dozen lengths. This ad
vantage was somewhat reduced by the
bettor course steered by the South Er.d
cockswain, but at no time <lid less than
two lengths separate the boats. Over a
greater part of the course the Alamedaa
rowed forty strokes to the minute, while
the losers rowed thirty-five. Toward the
end of the long pull bow and No. 1' of the
ln=ing crew showed signs of distress, while
the winners were still keeping up a live-
ly stroke of forty or forty-one. Stroke
Scully of the Souih End crew did good
work all through the race and was well
backed up by James Pallas at No. 3, but
the South End crew lacked swing and did
not sit their boat so well as the winners.
The Alameda senior crew was made up
as follows: J. Lewis, bow; W. G. Hari
sen. No. 2; D. G. Greenleaf. No. 3; F. W.
Ayers. stroke; E. Ha risen, cockswain.
The South End four consisted of J. P.
Foley, bow: Dr. C. C. Dennis. No. 2;
James Pallas, No. 3; Ed Scully stroke;
Albert Sonnenl>cr.ur, cockswain. The offi
cials in charge of the race were J. R.
Bockman. president of the Pacific Asso
ciation, referee; J. T. Sullivan, Pioneer
Rowing Club, starter; A. P. Rothkopf,
Dolphin Boating Club; C, H. Smith, presi
dent of the Alameda Boating Club, and
William Thomas, captain of the South
End Boating Club, judges: H. W. Maass,
vice president of the Alameda Boating
Club, and A. H. Melletz of the South End
Rowing Club, timers. A committee con
sisting of \V. B. Hinchman. C. H. Smith.
J 11. Tlmmon?, F. S. Cone and E. M.
Hunter had charge of the reception of vis
itors at the Alameda boathouse. which
was crowded with members of the club
and their friends. The weather was fa
vorable for boat racing, the sky being
overcast and the water almost perfectly
smooth.

TOLD A THRILLING
NARRATIVE OF SIN
Young Men Listen to Mrs. Edhohn's
Discourse.
OAKLAND, Jan. 21.â Mrs. Charlotte
Edholm, the well-known rescue mission
worker of New York and Chicago, lec
tured before a large audience of men at
the Y. M. C. A. Hall this afternoon. She
took fcr her subject the life work which
she had selected and vividly described the
hard life which fallen women were com
pelled to live and the cunning machina
tions of the totally depraved people who
inveigled them into such an existence.
"There are 300,0)0 of these poor
abandoned females In our country," she
said, "and one-half of them are from
Christian homes or Sunday-schools.
Three-fourths of them are from the coun
try, fresh and pure in their innocence.
They have been enticed Into haunts of
shame through the trickery and wiles of
parties engaged in the traffic in girls.
Their average life is only five years. Over
60.U00 girls are snared every year, an aver
age of one every eight minutes.
â¢â¢The traffic in drink and opium and ac
cursed cigarettes causes this wholesale
traffic in girls. Stop the sale of the nrst
three and you will soon stop the barter
ing in females. 1 have talked to hundreds
of these poor benighted beinga, procurers,
newspaper men and police. Â»uÂ«y also say
that the country is infested by organized
bands of fiends, who induce young girls
to enter upon a life of shame.
"Little children are enticed into immor
ality by them and the average age of the
females in these dens of shame is only
15 years. Every conceivable scheme la
used to trap them. Drugs are brought
into requisition and frequently mock mar
riages are performed. Then when a girl
is landed in one of these immoral houses
she is often kept a prisoner behind locked
doors and barricaded windows."
Mrs. Edholm Implored her hearers In
fervent language to aid in the work uf
rescuing these poor creatures. She ap
pealed to their Christianity and to their
humanity. A large number volunteered
to lend their support in every possible
way. It is the intention to establish
homes in San Francisco and Oakland for
women who are rescued as soon as the
necessary organization Is completed and
funds can bo ruised for that purpose. Co
operative homes, where living is furnish
ed at cost to self-respecting, self-support
ing, small-salaried young women, who,
because of slender Incomes, cannot other
wise provide safe and comfortable homes
for themselves. One such institution has
already been established in San Francisco.
It is located at 645 Folsom street and Is al
ready in a prosperous condition.

"IN PARADISE" IS
HILARIOUSLY FUNNY
"Whew! "In Paradise" Is a corker!
The Frawleys enlivened the Interior of
the California Theater last night with a
hurricane of hilarity. "In Paradise,"
perpetrated by Hennequln. Billhaud and
Carre, is a farce as French as absinthe
and as genuinely humorous as the spec
tacle of a kitten chasing its tall. Th*
combined roguery of the three authors
has produced three acts of wildly ex
travagant comedy that will jiggle laugh
ter out of any one. They are not over
particular morally or artistically how
they do it. but one forgets art and does
not think of morals when being amused
in the mad, whirling way that "In Para
dise" amuses. Neither Is art nor mor
als seriously endangered by such frank
fun as this. The critic must not always
carry a fixed bayonet and the novelist
who doesn't know his place should be
ordered off the grounds. French farces
are too often ruined in adaptation.
When they are warped to fit our cis-
Atlantlc ideas of propriety they lose their
excuse for being and become hopelessly
pilly. "In Paradise" has not been sub
jected to this shearing process, and It i.s
given to us in all the glory of its Parisian
naughtiness. It is not objectionable be
cause it is clever; there Is more wit in
the lines than in the generality of such
plays, and the situations are s"o humor
ously devised that you overlook every
thing but the fact that something is
making you merry. There is In tho sec
ond act of "In Paradise" a moment of
uproariousness that sweeps the theater
with gales of laughter, and time and
time again the mirth is so uncontrolled as
to render the actors Inaudible. I say that
one overlooks all but one's merriment
and this is true I am sure with all those
who do not have to consider the merits
of the people on the stage.
They may be passed over In this casÂ«
with general praise, for with one excep
tion they are adequate to the require
ments. It Is what they do. rather than
how they do it, that is Important, and if
there be no such shining examples or
clever characterization as we are accus
tomed to from native interpreters of
French humor yet Mr. Armory, Mr Ham
ilton and Mr. Shaw do not fall short of
prescribed standards. Francis Byrne Is
sadly unfitted for his part, however I
think It woyld be better taken even' by
Mr. Frawley himself. *

Sunday at the Park.
The park and beach were practically de
serted yesterday. The musical programme
was continued and the chill air made
pleasure almost an impossibility. At the
Chutes a fair crowd gathered. , The first
twelve rounds of tho Jeffrie's-Sharkey
tight were shown on the biograph, and
when the last film had swished past the
projecting light Emil Markeberg conclud
ed the performance by making a balloon
ascension. He landed without accident on
the roof of a dwelling near the Chutes
and his balloon was picked up in the park
half a mile away. Following are the re

WORRIED OVER A NAME
ON A HOTEL REGISTER
LOUNGERS IN THE CORRIDORS
CRITICIZE A SIGNATURE.
The question which is agitating thÂ«
loungers in the corridors of the Palace
Hotel is whether or not pre-emption ol a
name gives the pre-emptor a legal right
to assume it after a certain time has
elapsed without her right having been
challenged.
This is a rather momentous question,
and one involving more than Is usually
attached to the liipcuspions- that one hears
around a hotel desk. It has had Its origin
In a name that has recently appeared on
the hotel register, put there by one
whom the courts of this State have de
clared has no right to it â one to whom
others of the same name have offered
many thousands of dollars if she would
but "forego the enjoyment of dragging it
through the legal mire of a wtil con
test.
The name on the register is "Mr?. N. C.
Fair," and the woman who put It there
is Mrs. Nettie Craven of legal memory.
Mr:Â». Craven returned to this city a. few
days ago to be present at the opening of
the Fatr will contest, which again ap
pears on the calendar for Wednesday
next. She is accompanied by her daugh
ter Mrs. Koehier. formerly of the Co
lumbia, whom she hajj been visiting In
St. Louie.
Mrs. Koeli'.er signs herself Mrs. Koeh
ler. and the loungers find nothing to com
plain of. She has a right to tlie name,
and It goes. But with her mother it is
different. Mrs. Craven has never been
able to establish her right to the cog
nomen of the dead millionaire; In fact
the attempt she made to show that she
was the spouse of the departed Senator
failed most signally.
This fact seems to worry her but little.
She uses the name just the same and
with a freedom and abandon that would
make it appear she had been accustomed
to it for many a long year. It -goes on all
her orders, it is to be found at the bot
tom of every epi3tle she writes and it is
used when she is addressed by her Inti
mates. And all this notwithstanding the
lesson she received when her attorneys
were forced to erase It from the office
door in the Parrott building.
This is what worries the loungers In
the corridors of the big hostlery. Most
of them are moneyed men and theysulver
whenever they consider the possibilities
that may be' ln store for them when nu
merous ladies of their acquaintance get
on to the way the Fair name Is handed
out If this is done for a mere baga
telle of $40,000,000 what will happen to
them with their hoard of wealth? It 13
too much. They protest. Their names,
for the most part, are anything but fair,
but that makes no difference. They are
worried over the visions of future trouble
that the signature on the reeister has
conjured up before their fevered Imagina
tions and they wish to have the matter
sifted to tho bottom.
DEMOCRACY IS
BECOMING MORE
NEARLY PERFECT
So Says Dr. Jordan of
Stanford.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
90S Broadway, Jan. 21.
Dr. David Starr Jordan of Stanford Uni
versity spoke on "American Democracy"
to the socialists of Oakland at Grand
Army Hall to-night. Tl - speaker and his
auditors were evidently In hearty accord
with each other. Fully one-third of those
present were women.
"The United States is a great nation
and is rapidly forging to the forefront of
civilization," said the speaker. "However,
we must progress In a peaceful way, and
not by violent revolutionary methods. It
has taken a long time to attain the pres
ent excellent status which this country
now possesses as a nation, and it will
undoubtedly take another long period be
fore we attain that perfection where all
men will be treated with exact justice.
Education will be the means by which
that will be accomplished, and education
is making rapid strides.
"In the fore part of this or In the last
centuryâ that is, shortly after the Revo
lutionary war â many or the old farmers
of Connecticut decried the prevalence cf
the little red echoolhouaes in their com
munities. They thought the institutions of
learning were bad and taught equality
and sedition. Laborers, they asserted,
should be kept In Ignorance and compelled
to labor for a daily wage of a sheep'a
head and liver, while the wealthy farm
ers lived In luxury oft the hard work of
their hirelings. The schoolhouses re
mained, however, and sedition did not be
come rampant. A forward movement end
vast improvements have been the resu!*.
"Notwithstanding the good that learn
ing has done, there are people even to
day who denounce the higher education
of the masses, and say that If it con
tinues there will soon be nobody to do
the hard manual labor of the country.
We need have no fear, and the people
cannot get too much learning."
Dr. Jordan made no direct allusion to
the war In the. Philippines or the question
of expansion. Nor aid he say anything
about the Justice of the trouble raging
in South Africa. He alluded to both in an
indirect way, however, intimating that
England and the United States were both
In the wrong.
"I hate to see blood shed on the battle
field." he remarked, "and I think the
time Is not far distant when such things
will no longer occur. Whether England
Is right or whether Oom Paul and his
people fall to use soap and water are
questions which I do not Intend to dis
cuss. I will say, however, that one na
tion cannot govern another by force of
arms and do so long. Nor have they the
right to do so. Senator Hoar has been
called a traitor because he allowed his
conscience to control his patriotism. Some
day we will all do the same, and justice
will prevail.
"Our Government Is not perfect, but It
Is our own fault. We sometimes have
drunken Consuls, and most of our offi
cial:* exiuld be beaten for competency by
going to the Intelligence offices for our
supply. That Is our fault. No country is
governed in a bettor manner than the
people demand. Some day wp will get
tired of poor government, and will go to
the polls and remedy !t. That is the
way. We have the cure for bad govern
ment in our own hands, and violent
measures are not necessary."
Dr. Jordan predicted that we would
eventually have a perfect democracy.
He was frequently applauded during his
remarks. Several ouestions were asked by
different people afterward, and were ail
answered with apparent satisfaction.
OVER A DOZEN
COAL CARRIERS
HAVE MADE PORT
Fuel Should Now Be
Plentiful Again.
PILOTS ARE KEPT VERY BUSY
Â»
THE OVERDUE PASS OP KIL
LIECKANXIE ARBIVES.
City of Puebla and Pomona to Get
New Boilers on the Sound â Gov
ernment Kay Purchase
Yacht El Primero.
Another fleet of deep-water ships made
port yesterday, and there will now be a
lull in the list of arrivals for a week or
ten days. With the exception of a few
vessels that have met with accidents,
two or three that are considered overdue
and one that is coming here via the Cape
of Good Hope, all of the looked-for ships
have arrived. The A. G. Ropes from New
York, Samoena from Antwerp and Crom- -
dale from Liverpool may be expected to ,
put In an appearance at any time. Their
arrival will put an end to the rush, and
the rilctJs will have a rest for a few i
days.
Among the fleet that got In yesterday
was the Clan Graham 74 days, Celtic
Monarch 64 days and Arts-tides SO days
from Newcastle, Australia; Inverlochy I
H'J days, inverlyon 14J days and Pass of
Kiiliecrankie 100 days trom Swansea;
Ralasure IZJ days from Antwerp and St.
Francis 146 days from Philadelphia. Be
sides these a rleet of coal-ia.den coasters
made port during the day. The Pass of
Kiiiiecrankie was classed among the
overvlutH, and S per cent was paid by the
underwriters to reinsure vessel and cargo.
The St. Francis is the first of the new
fleet purchased by the California Ship
ping Company fr<un Flint &Â¦ Co. She is
a tine vessel of 1757 ton;- net burden, and
after discharging here will go to Hono
lulu to load sugar for New York. She
was delayed by iight and variable winds.
Her cargo is composed principally of pig
iron, canned goods, okum. paint, creosote,
oil, caustic soda and copper.
During the past three days fourteen
coal-la.den vessels h^ve made port. They
bring in all about 40,0 m) tons of the blacK
diamonds. Uf this quantity 15,000 tons
came from the Sound on the steamers
Willamette, Wellington and Washtenaw
and ships C. F. Sargeant, Highland
Light, Spartan and Gatherer. The re
mainder of the coal came on the General
Gordon, Inverlyon. Pass of Kiiliecrankie,
Celtic Monarch, Aristides, Inverlochy and
Clan Graham from Swansea and New
castle, Australia. All the vessels had un- j
eventful passages. The Celtic Monarch,
which made the best run of the fleet, wa.s
becalmed for two weeks off the coast of
New Zealand. All the other captains re- |
port light and variable winds.
The quarantine officer was over two
hours inspecting the Inverlochy. There
had been two death? during the voyage.
and three of the crew were sick. The
ship's log- showed that on December IS
H. A. Watson, an able seaman, had died
of palsy, and on January IS Alfred
Bowon had died of dropsy. Dr. Kerr de
cided that the sick men had an attack of ;
scurvy, so he allowed the vessel to entei. I
On the Aristides the captain reported I
one hurricane, in which one of t lie life
boats was smashed. On December 14 the
vessel was hove to off Pucalrn Island.
The natives came off In a whaleboat and
gave the crew a bountiful feupply of fruit
and vegetables. Everybody was v.ell on
Pit calm.
It is said that Timothy Hopkins' steam
yacht El Primero is to be purchased by
tlie Government aj> a. tender for the i
transport fleet. The yacht would be all j
right for carrying mail and passengers
to and from the vospels arriving and de
parting for Manila, but when it came to
moving or docking one of the big: steam
ers the Ei Primero would be useless. The
El Primero was built by the Union Iron
Works for Mr. Hopkins several years ago,
but t-lnce she was launched she has not
been six months all told in commission.
She is fast, but in order to obtain speed
her hull was built of very light material, j
and In consequence she is as tender as a
torpedo-boat. Should the Government j
purchase the EI Primero Mr. Hopkins will
nave a larger and more commodious
sieamer built.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
Is getting its f.eet In order for the sum
mer travel. The Pomona is to be with
drawn from the Kureka run and will go
\r> St-attle to have new boilers put in. '
The City of Puebla will also co north for
new boilers, ami the Santa Rosa will be
withdrawn from the southern routo afte^
her next trip and will be overhauled here.
The fact that the Pomona and City of
Puebla are going to Seattle for new boil
ers gave rise to the rumor that all the
repair work on the Pacific Coast Com
pany's steamers was going to be done
on the Sound after this. The fact Is that
tenders for the nÂ»w boilers for the two
steamers were called for and a Seattle
firm, being the lowest bidder, got the con
tract. All the repair work on the Santa
Rosa will be done here.
Dan Higclns was taken to the Harbor
Hospital yesterday morning suffering
from two knife wounds In the breast. He
was drinking with a companion In a
saloon on Kearny street, near Clay, when
They quarreled. Hlgjrins <1M not know
for several minute* that he was stabbed,
and then he made for the hospital. Dr.
ThornÂ©- dressed his wounds ana put h'rn
to bed. Later he was removed to the
Â«*ity and County Hospital. Higplns re
fused to give the name of the man who
stabbed him.
The many arrivals during the past
twenty-four hours has made navisation
very (iancerous between MeigÃs Wharf
and Alcatraz. Over twenty vessels are
anchored there, and some of them wilf
have to be moved to-day or else there will
be a collision.

Tombstone in Wrexham Churchyard
of the Founder of Yale College.
Ellis Lover writes! to the London Times:
"Tho recent visit to this country of a
number of nthletc students from Yale Col
lege, United States of America, Induces
me to senrt you the epitaph upon the
founder of that college, which I copied
from his tombstone in Wrexham Church
yard. North Wales, ponif years ago:
" 'EUugh Yale. Esm., was buried the
twenty-second of July, In the year of our
Lord MDCCXXI. â¢
" 'Born In America, in Europe bred,
In Africa traveled; in Asia wed.
Where long: ho lived and thrived. In Lon
don dead.
Much' good, some ill, he did, so hope all's
even,
And that his soul through mercy's gone
to heaven. .
You that survive and read this tale, take
care.
For the most certain exit to prepare.
Where blest In peace the actions of the
just
Smell sweet and blossom In the silent
dust.'
"The tomb Is on the western side of the
church, within an Iron railing:. At one
time Yale was Governor of Madras. He
was tried in England for hanging his
groom, because he rode his horse two or
tlm-e days for the benefit of his health
without leave of hir. master. Yale escaped
with a heavy penalty. He was the first
man in England to establish and use a
sale by auction. Mis wife and only child
lie in one grave at Uie Cape of Good
Hope. From Yale College, so called after
the founder, hundreds of students have
made pilgrimages t'i Wrexham to view
his grave. The tnmli was? restored in IS2O
by the church wardens, and ngatn in 1574
at the cost <>f Yale College. 1 believe it
has. within Ihe last two years, bten fur
ther renovated."

FREDERICK ESOLA IS
TRAPPED IN PERJURY
Swears Falsely in the Teeth of
the Commissioners. '
He Denies His Participation in a Meeting
at Which They Saw and Talked
With Him of His Candidacy.
<7 tC The Call's account yesterday of the Esola investigation before the Po
lice Commissioners the statement was made that "Esola's cunning
served better than his memory." The Call wishes here and now to sup
!i plenient that statement with another, that Esola has committed perjury.
The Call will produce as its witnesses to this charge Mayor Phelan.
the four Police Commissioners and Esola's chief backer. A. M. Lawrence.
Esola's testimony Saturday night concerning his informal meet
ing with the new Commissioners was limited exactly to thirteen words
â unluckily for him. Each and every one of them was a lie uttered in the
belief that it would have to be swallowed by the Commissioners, whom, he
fancied, would be forced willy nilly to appoint him to the high offir to
which he aspired. He said "no" once; he said "I don't remember" twice;
he said "I don't recollect" once, and he said "I cannot recollect" just be
fore he left the stand. He gave five answers to questions, committing per
jury once with absolute hardihood and four other times by absolute indirec
tion. His whole testimony on that joint was a lie. It was given in response
to questions concerning that famous informal meeting of the new Police
Commissioners held two weeks ago yesterday at the Mayor's office. There
were present the Mayor, Commissioners Xewhall, Thomas. Biggy and Mc-
Nutt. Frederick Esola, alias Harrington, and his backer. A. M. Lawrence.
The Mayor and the Commissioners have had at no time any trouble recall
ing that meeting. It was not thought up till Saturday night that either
Esola or La*rence would, but both were placed on the stand and questioned
about it. Lawrence admitted it. reluctantly, it is true, but admitted it. Esola
denied it at first, committing sheer perjury, then fell back on a useful mem
ory and said he could not recall it. Side by side, here and now. is given the
testimony of Esola in all its perjury, and the testimony of Lawrence bear
ing directly on the meeting in question:
ESOLA'S PERJURY.
LAWRENCE'S ADMISSIONS.
"Was there no* a meeting of the
commisf ion one otinday afternoon at
which you Ttrv presentf"
"No."
"Have you ..ttrnded anr meetings
of the commission other than those
Leld during- this investigationP"
'â¢I don't remember," said Esola.
"Did you not attend a meeting at
Ilayor Phelan'^ office when this com
mission was presentf"
"I don't remember."
"Were you ever present at a meet
ing where the Commissioners were
present, no c as a commlssionP"
"I don't recollect."
"Do you recaJl when you were with
A- M. Lawrence and these Commis
sioners in Mayor Phelan'* office at
any time since January If"
"I 'â¢ann.ot recollect," said .Esola,
MrGowwi-Mr. Lawrence, did you erer attend
Â« mating or this commission oth^r than those
they held (or tbe purpoo? of Investigating: these
charge*?
l>awrenceâ There waÂ» never a mcttlnf ot this
commission.
McGowanâ How do j-ou know thar* wu not?
l^anience â Not when I was present.
McOowanâ Well, of thÂ« four members?
Lawrenceâ You want to know what the real
thine Is. don't you?
McGowanâ l do.
Lawrenceâ The members of this commission
called to [-ay a visit to Mr. Phelaa and I drop
tied In there.
McO>wanâ Was Mr. Esola thersT
I>Â«ivreno* â He came In later.
McGowan â How did you know there waa to
be a meeting?
Lawrenceâ l ru tnformsd. Informed by the
Mayor.
MoGowia- Tea were Informed that there was
r meeting of that commission and you came
out?
Lawrenceâ Tes.
McGowanâ And &13 you Inform Mr. Esol&T
Lawrenceâ Tes.
McGowanâ And to that extent !t was precon
certed that guch a meeting was to be held?
I^awrence â Tes.
McGowan -And for that reason you took Mr.
Esola out there?
Lawrence- -Yes, sir. he was In the room for
only about ten minutes.
Can there be any doubt that Esola perjured himself in jiving that testi
mony.' Can there be any doubt that the Commissioners knew that he was
perjuring himself? Directly, flatly, in answer to the first question, he an
swereu "no." Before taking efuge in a weak memory to evade committing
other direct perjuries, he looked each time appealingly to his attorney. Why
did he do it? Did he not know that the four Commissioners were well
aware that he was at that meeting:? Did lie not know that A. M. Law
rence knew it and that Mayor Hfelan knew it? Did he not know that his
attorney. Garret McEnerney. knew it? Did he not know that he was de
liberately committing perjury? It is almost usdess to ask such questions.
Of course he did. He was at that .neeting two week* ago yesterday. He
was introduced by Lawrence to ekch and every one of the Police Commis
sioners as a candidate for Chief of Police, He was the principal party in
interest; he had the greatest stake to gain. And yet on the stand, know
ing as he did that the four Commissioners, the Mayor and A. M. Lawrence
knew that he was at the meeting, he answered "no" and "I don't remem
ber." He perjured himself.
In perjuring himself Frederick Esola, alias Harringtonâ who gained that
alias, by the way. through no boyish prank-- has tried to jam a lie down
the throats of the Police Commissioners. No matter how well they were
disposed toward him when the investigation began, they know now, by the
evidence of their own senses, that he is a perjurer. They are well disppsed
gentlemen, no doubt â The Call has always so thought and has never inti
mated otherwise, except to state that they were the innocent considerations
in an infamous bargain made by Mayor Phelan in his lust for power. It has
never been doubted that there was honesty enough on the board to prevent
a conspiracy so foul when the evidences of that conspiracy wereforthcoming.
Some of those evidences were forthcoming during the investigation, but the
great confirmation of the unfitness of Esola. alias Harrington, came from
himself. He is a self-convicted oerjurcr. Brazenly he has broken an oath
to further his greed for place. He has lied in the teeth of the men. who.
certainly, at first were disposed to befriend him.
Of all the sins charged against Esola, he has given proof of the worst
His testimony Saturday night took away, as well it might, the breath of
the Commissioners. It made them for the moment doubt the evidence of
their own senses. On reflection they began to think that he must b e an
ignoramus. Even The Call, which has been actuated in this fight only by a
desire for the best government, was inclined to think that Esola was only
exercising the cunning of the low mind it knew him to possess. Now it
knows and submits the proof that he is nothing more nor less than a per
jurer.
Messrs. Newhall. Thomas. Biggy and McNutt. you know, don't you.
that Esola. alias Harrington, perjured himself Saturday night? Are you pr-
pared to elect a perjurer Chief of Police? The Call does not think so
SALOON MAN STIFLED
BY DEADLY FUMES
George Fortman Suffocated in His Sleep During a Fire on Jessie
and Ecker Streets and Died En Route to the Hospital.
The Property Is a Total Loss.
George Fortman. proprietor of a small
grocery an( j saloon on the southwest cor
ner of Ecker and Jessie streets, was suffo
cated in his bedroom early this morn
ing, It Is supposed, by the overturning of
c. lamp.
He lived alone just over his little place
of business. His room was reached by a
ladder, and !t had no ventilation. It is
believed he went to sleep with the lamp
burning, and thÂ«t in some way It either
fell from where It was placed or" ex-
Jjlodr-d.
The building; is a light frame structure
and immediately It blazr-d up with every
promise of a big flro. The policeman on
the beat saw it and sent in an alarm
from box 2CI. and soon after the engines i
responded the fire was out.
Fortman was found by one of the fire- I
men lying on his bed. HÂ« was unconscious I
and apparently had been overcome by tho I
smoke without awakening. With some!

THE MARION IN THE STREAM.
The old sloop of war Marlon has left the
berth at Folsom-street wharf where she
has lain so long, and Is now the sole
occupant of uian-o'-war'a row off Folsom
street.
For a long time attempts have been
made to get the old warship out of her
berth, but the Harbor Commissioners
counted the value of the berth and the
value of the old vessel as a training ship
for the Naval Militia, and let her stay.
The wharf Is to be repaired, however,
and so she had to go out Into the stream
She will be given another berth farther
down the front.
The vessel, under command of Captain
N. T. James, the newly elected com
mander, left the dock under her own
steam and manned by a crew of Naval
Reserves. They worked the engines, stood
watch at the wheel and heaved over the
two-ton anchor In shipshape and without
hitch or accident.
It Is the intention of Captain James to
take the vessel on several cruises around
the bay before he again brings her back
to a berth alongside a wharf.
WARRING TONGS
ARE WEARY OF
THEIR STRIFE
Compact to Be Signed
With Police.
The reign of peace In Chinatown Is
dawning. A treaty between the Hop Sing-
Tong and the Suey Sing Tong has been
drawn up, signed by representatives of
one of the warring factions and only laoks
the signature of Wong Shi Shu, president
of the worsted Hop Sing Tong to make It
a solemn compact. A messenger has gone
to Maxysville. where the delinquent signa
ture may be obtained. Wong Shi Shu
having been In seclusion in the neighbor
hood of Chico since the odor of gun
powder became percept'ble In this" city.
The prospective settlement has been
brought about by the Gee (Sum Tong, a
powerful organization, to which about
two-thirds of tho residents of Chinatown
contribute and are members. The peace
making ton;? handled the warring fac
tions without gloves and made Imperative
demands upon them for a cessation of
hostilities. They realized the extent of
the havoc wrought In the Chinese colony
by the repeated acts of violence, and ar
rived at the conclusion that something
must be done to release Chinatown from
the strong clutches of police rule. Acting
Chief Bogy's action in closing gambling
houses and dens of prostitution has al
ready lightened the purses of their
heathen owners: the stagnation of busi
ness has been felt by tho merchants, and
the determination to drlve^all Chinese
from the United States who were not
possessed of certltlcates of residence
alarmed the better and wealthier class of
Chinamen as veil as the plebeians and
criminals, as many of the former reside
here In defiance of the law.
The Buey Sing tong consented to Fign
articles of peace without argument. Tne
members of the Hop Sing tong were re
luctant, but when pressed reve"alod the
hiding place of their president and re
ferred the matter to him. Before a mes
senger could leave this city with the con
tract however, tts contents were commu
nicated to Wong Shi Shu by wire, and It
was stated last night that with a few al
terations In the terms of peace he would
be willing to affix his signature to the
document.
One of the most important compacts
ever drawn up In the history of local
Chinese affairs will be given Into the
keeping of Acting Chief of Police Bigey
withln a few days. To-day he will meet
the presidents of ten of the tongs now
existing In Chinatown, not incuding tho
two warring organizations, 'and complete
arrangements for Its composition.
The Acting Chiefs first demand will be
for the names of all tong presidents, vice
presidents, secretaries and interpreters
in this city, also their places of meeting
and official residences. This information
has been promised him. The compact will
contain the agreement of the tongs that
forever murder shall cease to b'- the pen
alty for Infractions of tonf law. and that
all differences shall henceforward be set
tled by arbitration. Ho Vow, Chinese
Consul General, will vouch for the con
tract after It Is signed and delivered. Se
vere penalties and promises of lajjal pros
ecution will fellow suould any of the
tongs fail to keep faith.
One of the most Important promises
made by the tonjrs "~'i vouched for by
Consul General 110 Vow Is In relation to
the conduct of witnesses at the trial of
Chinese murderers. Should any China
man apt>ear in bohalf of a Chinese ac
cused of any highbinder* murder, and
swear falsely, the vengeance of tho
Flowery Kingdom will be invoked upon
him through the tongs and Consul. The
matter will be reported by them to China
and his family will suffer the vengeance
of heathen laws. At present It Is almost
impossible to convict a Chinaman on nc
count of the retinue of hired witnesses
who are willing to go on the stand and
swear to anything that the ends of jus
tice may be defeated, but the suggestion
that their families may be mnde to suffer
by diplomatic Interference may succeed in
breaking up the organisation. Â¦ â¢:*

PHF.T.AN WINKS AT RESIDENCE
QUALIFICATIONS.
John Ginty of San Diego, Whose
Home Is Where Jobs Are Soft
est, Gets a Lucrative
Appointment.
All deputies, clerks, assistants and
other employes of the city and county
must be citizens of the United States,
and must, during their respective
terms of office or employment, actu
ally reside in the city and county, and
must have so resided for one year
next preceding their appoint
ment.âArticle XVI, Section 2, char
ter of San Francisco.
San Francisco's netv charter, under ar
ticle 16. section 2, provides that no one Is
eligible to hold a position In any depart
ment of the city government unless he Is
o citizen of the United States and haa
been a bona fide resident of the dty for
at least a year next p-ecedlng the date
of his appointment. The section has been
totally disregarded by those who during
the last campaign did the most talking
In favor of the new organic law of the
new municipality. Some of the most lu
crative deputyshlps and most desirable
positions have been parceled out to those
who by the charter's terms are barred
from feeding at the public crib.
As has been developed In many munici
pal matters of late, these violations of
the law have been made in many in
stances at the Instigation of Mayor Phe
lan. He has winked his eye at the char
ter whenever Its provisions came between
him and his political ambitions. It ap
pears to have been a case of Phelan first
and the law last.
Looking way ahead at a Senatorial
rainbow, he saw that concessions to the
State organization of the Democracy
would be a necessary thing In connection
with the barest possibility of realizing'
his ambition. When he became king of
new San Francisco the party leaders
demanded a share of the spoils. A cer
tain number of positions were given to
them and they were filled without the
least regard to the charter provision as
to residence.
There is evidence that there are many
such now In the city's employ. Prominent
among them is John F. Glnty. chief clerk
In Assessor Dodge's office. Mr. Ginty Itai
not been known as a resident of San
Francisco for a long time before he ap
peared on the political horizon as the
winner of one of the largest plums In
Assessor Dodge's office. He was appoint
ed because the State Democracy wanted
him cared for. Mayor Phelan used Dodge
to carry out the deal In much the same
fashion that Lawrence appears to be
using the Mayor In the Esola disgrace.
Mr. Phelan is aware of the fact that
Glnty has not been a resident of the city
for a sufficient length of time to qualify
him to draw a salary from Â¦ the public
treasury. Mr. Glnty Is better known in
San Diego than he is here, and it is but
a few months ago that he was filling a
position as clerk in the southern city. JfÂ»
has the reputation of being a migratory
character, who has no fixed residence, but
makes his home wherever the political
Jobs are the Boftest.
And there are others.

Secret Session of Democratic Commit

Members of the Democratic County
Committee from the Thirty-sixth District
met In secret conference yesterday after
noon for the purpose of apportioning
among the faithful the offices which .mve
been set apart for the district by the
powers that be. Fire Commissioner John
Grady ts said to have Issued the call for
the meeting, which was held in a vacant
ptore on Mission street, between Twenty
fourth and Twenty-fifth.
It was reported that Grady was weary
of Btandlng off the iob chasers and passed
the buck to the district committeemen,
although it Is whispered that his main
purpose was to shut out a few claimants
for positions under the new city govern
ment whom he dare not antagonize by a
personnl refusal of their requests. Grady
announced when he was appointed F<re
Commissioner that he was out of politics,
but he is believed to still cherish an am
bition to be recognized as dictator of the
district, and it has been given out that
without his indorsement no man In the
Thirty-sixth can hope to secure one of
the coveted appointments.
CIGARETTE SMOKING

George F. Welsh Wins a Prize at the
Exercises in Old St. Peter's
Church.
Packed to the doors was the old St.

choral "The Land of Swallows, rendered
by the Misses McCarthy, Rlordan. Ken
drick Malone, Sullivan and Kane. This
was followed by a solo by Bert Felvey.
after which John Keefe spoke eloquently
on the habit of cigarette smoking. Sand
wiched in between this essay and that of
George Welsh was a vocal solo by James
CjÂ»oVts Keefe and Welsh hurled thun
derbolt after thunderbolt asralnst the
deadly nicotine. They told of the under
mining of physical and mental health that
follows the use of the cigarette, how the
faculties are blurred and dimmed by the
habit of smoking, and especially of the
evils that comes with Its use by young
"onÂ© of the most pleasing numbers on

TOBIN WANTS OLD EMPLOYES
REINSTATED.
To-Day's Meeting of the Board Will
Probably Develop Many Inter
esting Political
Facts.
-<â â ?
This afternoon's meeting of the Super
visors will demonstrate whether or not
Mayor Phelan is to control the patronage
in the office of the clerk of the board. So
far every commission of which Phelan
has the appointment has yielded to him
without question the distribution of the
positions connected with their several of
fices, that he might distribute them where
they would best serve to promote his
political Interests and tend to keep In
his hands the control of the Democratic
organization. At the start It looked a& If
the Supervisors would as meekly follow
eulc
His Honor boasted that fifteen members
of the board would take his orders at any
time he might be pleased to issue them.
He claimed all, in fact, except the throe
members of the Republican minority, and
was contident that he had things his way
in that body as in the others.
Then a caucus came off which opened
the executive eyes. Phelan wanted to
clean out the entire clerking force of the
old board, and Issued his orders to that
effect. .Notwithstanding that most of th"
clerks had been Jn office for years and had
established a reputation for good work
that had never been brought into ques
tion, his Honor wanted to wipe them all
off the list and unload a bunch of depu
ties who had nothing to recommend them
have that they had come out strong lor
him during the campaign. John Russell
was the one exception he made. Such
men as John Ryan. George T. Phelps and
Frank Sllvey, upon whom Mr. Russell had
always relied to attend to the important
work of the department. Mr. Phelan
wanted to displace, and he sent his orders
Into the caucus to that effect. The names
he proposed in their stead were John 13.
Behan, John Lenihan and John Donlan.
It was understood by every member in
attendance at the caucus that these were
Phelan's men, and no opposition to them
was expected.
None developed until Dr. d'Ancona got
up and demanded that when it came to
an open meeting of the board none of the
members should be bound by the caucus
agreement. The reason for his demand,
which developed later, was that a plan
was then forming to hold for the boar.l
itself its own patronage. D'Ancona anJ
the others behind it did not feel strong
enough to bring It out in caucus, but they
were confident that they could make it
go by the time the next regular meeting
came off. Although the Phelan adherents
were in control of the caucus they were
compelled to accede to D'Ancona's de
mands, and a resolution was finally adopt
ed that the caucus agreement should not
be binding.
The matter came up regularly at last
Monday's meeting of the board. Phelan
paw that his original plan would not cni
rv, and attempted from the chair to so
shape things that all of the board s
patronage should be thrown Into the
hands of the Civil Service Commission.
His game was nicely blocked by Reed,
Comte and D'Ancona, to whom Plielaii di
rected his greatest atentlgn. To-day the
matter will come up before the board for
a final settlement, and It Is understood
that Tobin, Hotaling and Reed, with 3
half-dozen others, will take the side of
the old employes and Insist that they be
retained for the best Interests of the of
fice.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 1900.
MRS. GREENAN TO
ANSWER TO SOME
SERIOUS CHARGES
Principal of a School
in Trouble.
CLAIMS IT IS SPITE WORK
ACCUSED OF PLAYING THE
PONIES.
Â»
Suspended From Duty Pending an
Investigation by the Board of
Education Regarding Her
Conduct.
Mrs. Rebecca Greenan, who was sus
pended by the old Board of Education a
short time prior to their retirement from
oftico, has been called upon by the present
board to answer to some ugly charges.
Mrs. Greenan, prior to her suspension,
was principal of the John W. Taylor
School at Sunnyvale.
At the time Mrs. Greenan was suspend
ed charges were filed against her, but for
some reason she was not given a chance
to defend herself. The present board,
however, has taken up the charges and
according to the statement of Director
Mark, president of the board, a thorough
Investigation will be made. The inquiry
has been set for Thursday morning at 10
o'clock, and some interesting testimony is
expected.
The greatest secrecy has been, maintain
ed by the members of the board as to the
nature of, the charges preferred against
Mrs. Greenan. Director Mark declares
that he has not 6cen the charges, but be
lieves they accuse Mrs. Greenan of visit-
Ing the racetrack and neglecting her du
ties as a member of the School Depart
ment. Superintendent of Schools Webster
says that Mrs. Greenan has not been at
tending to business, but whether or not
she was In the habit of visiting the race
track he could not say.
Mrs. Greenan keenly feels her suspen
sion and is anxious for an investigation.
"The charges are ridiculous." she in
dignantly remarked yesterday afternoon
when asked about the matter. "I can
prove by a number of witnesses that I
have not been in the habit of visiting the
racetrack, nor do I know any touts, as
some of my enemies seem to claim. I
have not been officially notified of the
charges, but am ready at any time to de
fend my good name against what seems
to me to be a dastardly plot to ruin an
honorable woman. From an unofficial
source I learned that charges have been
filed against mo accusing me of being
impertinent to the parents of several of
my pupils; being late in reaching the
school and dismissing the class before the
usual hour.
"As to the reported charge that I have
been groing to the racetrack and playing
the races, it Is absolutely false. The whole
trouble Is due to Mrs. Burnett, who Is
lanltress of the Sunnyvale School. We
nave had several wordy disputes and not
long a?'" 1 she called me a liar In the pres
ence of the class. I threatened to report
her to the trustees of the school and she
then said she would pet even with me.
From various sources I learned that she
was endeavoring to have me dismissed
from the department, claiming that I was
incompetent, notwithstanding: that I have
been a. schoolteacher for a number of;
years. I will prove at the Investigation
that the charpes were prompted by mal
ice and that a concerted effort is being
made to deprive me of my position."
Mrs. Greenan is tlie wtfe of Police Offi
cer Greonan of the Southern Station and
is the mother of a lartre family.
