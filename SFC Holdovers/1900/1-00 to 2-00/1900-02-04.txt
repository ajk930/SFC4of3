SUNDAY CALL
CALIFORNIAS
ODDEST
TOURISTtfrar^ed by an aged skate of a horse and
Arlven fey a ewarthy youth of 16 or 17
years. A few words In tha Italian tongue
we exchanged by the youth and boy and
the latter hand over the package of food,
while tha floureack Is replenished with
matches. Tho driver of the wagon does
not fall to collect the money received by
the child, who starts off . up' the . street
ap-aJn to make the fame or a similar plea
to those who will answer the ring of the
doorbell. t\':^'V ~ v -..*?.*.-
A few blocks tway the driver of the
dilapidated rig mentioned is holding an
animated conversation with another lit
tle dark-skinned match ocddler who un-
of the situation, as shown by the furtive
glances be. takes upon turning each cor
ner. . He gives a start' upon seeing a big,
powerful Italian, .evidently from Sicily, or
Corsica, approach. The latter grunts out
an inquiry arid the youth"' hands over the
purse of, dimes and nickels and points to
tha provisions stored in" the wagon. If
the day's work Is satisfactory the man
grunts again and strolls along. If not,
the fact is apparent from tho unhappy
expression on the face of the youth, who
knows what to expect when the day is
over and he. gets back to the place called
home and when the big man takes pos
session of the horsewhip. Woe be to the
little match peddlers when the "father"
is displeased.
Such is the operation of a "padrone"
system carried on every day In the street*
WHEN AND WHY WE LAUGH
Anthropologists say that the ability to
laughi comes to the child as It grows older.
Tho first smile la observed when the child
Is about forty to sixty days, old., but It
does not begin to laugh until some', time
after that. According to Mantegazza and
others the power of laughing has' to be
", acquired, Just as a child learns how to
Ualk or to walk. Laughter at the earliest
'Â¦Is observed in infants only after they are
. I three months old.
'. Children and women laugh more than
jmen, not becjause the cares of life lie less
â¢heavily upon them, but because the
former are more excitable and because
the moderating power 'of the cerebral
though it has its origin from tha -brain ot
a poet.
The envious, wicked and malevolent
rarely laugh- because, phrenologists say,
they, are impregnated with bile and ara
therefore morose. The haughty, the vain,:
and the awkward also laugh very little,
for fear of losing their dignity. The SpanJ
ish people, who are proverbially graver,
are a good example. ;1^
People who have lines extending down-.
ward from the angle at the mouth toward
the chin well marked rarely laugh, and.
moreover, show a tendency to penslveness
in youth and melancholy in after life.'
Thoso who have lines raying outward
hemispheres is leas in them than among
men . generally.
Prqfound- study makes men serious, and
sp > foollsh people are sometimes noted for
laughing immoderately. Yet laughter la
not so, much an index to intelligence as
fcit.ls.'to the pon'dltlon of health. Healthy,
vigorous' people are* proverbially of good
humored, joyous, laughing natures, while
tha "sallow, gloomy-eyed dyspeptic" is a
description scientifically - accurate, al-
from the eyes are, on the, contrary, people
who laugh a good deal, especially when
the upper lip Is framed by two deep fur
rows running down to the mouth.
Lavater, the noted Swiss physiogno
mist, says that frank, easy, copious
laughter indicates "a good soul devoid of
vanity." Such people often have a great
many wrinkles running obliquely outward
and downward from the eyes. They also
have full., ooen Hds and a round, larea
forehead.
Ing on the streets and openly begging. The
authorities at last put down the evil and
now only isolated cases are reported. A
number of years ago a padrone was dis
covered In this' city. He brought from
the East two pretty little girls, whom he
compelled to beg from house to house.
Tha police took tha little ones Into cus
tody, and later tha well-to-do Italians of
another fellow of the same strip* was
starting up In a similar line of business. ".
It is barely possible that the laws of the
State are not broad enough to cover these
cases, especially if the defense should ba
made that the boys sell matches on com
missionâand beg of their own volition.
However, an effort will be made soon to
break up this imported system of child
slavery. \
of San Frandsco under the very eyes of
the police. It was believed that this
shocking: form of child slavery had been
wiped out of every city in the United
Â¦States, but- it is not. Thepadrone system
of making children earn a living for lazy,
'able-bodied- vagrants originated in Italy
among the lower class, where it flourishes
to-day. The "father." or padrone, as he
1 is called.-hlres, borrows or steals such lit
tle children as serve his purpose best, and
'by brUte force and Intimidation compels
his slaves to beg in the streets, or. from
door to door. In many instances he
teaches them to steal, or to play some
musical. lnstrument, whichever they show
the most aptness for. The thieves are
the more profitable, but there Is 1 less dan
ger to himself in having musicians, as
money dropped in a tambourine or cap is
safer than that pilfered from pockets or
houses. A crust of bread and a curse Is
the masters reward to his slaves, or a
lashing ff the day's returns are too small.
Th'o earnings of the children invariably
go to the wine seller and the card table.
A very small portion is offered to the Vir
gin or one of the saints, for good fortune

Judge Hale Rix,: Years after It 'was

goodly sum for revealing '. their .where

Since then there has been no child
slavery of this order known of here until
the present instance was brought to light.
The discovery was made by .E. L. Fitz
gerald, late Labor Commissioner.-. Â¦ FT*
lives in the Western Addition, and was a
witness to the plea of a little match seller
for patronage and the. youngster- s tear*
and request for food for the Imaginary
hungry mother, brothers and sisters. Ha
also witnessed. the chastisement adminis
tered by the youth who drives tj)9 supply
wagon and gathers in the provisions. Tha
punishment was stopped and Mr. |* lt2 "
gerald made an examination of the con
tents of the wagon. In It hÂ» found over
a hundred pounds of all kinds of edibles
from a soda cracker to the breast of a
turkey, to say nothing Of nuts. fruita'and .
other luxuries given by big. kind-j&eajted
patrons to the small match sellers.'
These facts have been presented toitha
California Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and Officer McMurray
has been making an investigation which,
will result in the breaking up of the pa
drone system here. It has proved no easy
task to get at the facts, for among this
Class of people there exists an obligation
of secrecy, and even the parents of the
little peddlers sre no harm In their off-:
spring being utilized in this way so lons
as the work brings in a few dimes. Tha
padrone at the head of the local institu
tion came from New York a few. month*
ago, accompanied by the lad who now
manages the supply, wagon. .â¢ .
Among the poorer class of his coun
trymen the fellow soon found all the ma
terial he wanted for hla purpose. From
what can be learned by the officers of
the humane society the little match ped
dlers are bound over by some sort of con
tract which gives the padrone unlimited
power to dr> with them as he wishes, and
this power is respected and feared by tna
unfortunate urchins. The right to punish
for neglecting to make returns on th*
matches, in money or food, seems, to be
delegated trÂ» the yours fellow who drives

"You have heard of the great singer's
Italian tour? How ehe made tHe round
cf the chief Italian towns, and forced the
dwellers in that land of music to own
their native songsters surpassed by a
denizen of the land of fog and frost?
There was a good deal of prejudice
against the English 'diva' before her ar
rival, and it was thought rather a risky
experiment to Import a singer into Italy
Instead of exporting one from thenceâ
but the firet performance of our company
dispelled all anxiety. The audience might
be patriotic Italians, but they were musi
c'.a:.s first; end the dear sweet notes of
that marvelous voice swept away_ all na
tional Jealousy. The audience went mad
der than our sober English folk had dona
at home, and Madame 's tour became
a veritable ovation. -
"She had traveled from England with
her own complete company â the trip, in
fact, was not organized by. herself, but
by an enterprising manager who took all
risk and' expense, and paid the singer a
handsome sum for each performance. I

resolute to thrust myself into that tour-"
ing company.. For a singer, and a suc
cessful one. Madame had hitherto
"been singularly free from the attacks of
envious rivals. .1 think this partly arose
froia her own sunny sweetness of disposi

leÂ«s fortunate members of her profession,
her rare modesty regarding her own great

Ll p* for a race, j Madame
Vltm * M had her own cook
one of her greatest effects, and always
'brought down the house.' I was waiting
at the side scenes when the curtain drew
up for this last act. I bad no actual busi
ness to.be there at the time; but not for
worlds would I have lost the opportunity
of seeing my angel in her great triumph
hour. Squeezed behind some canvases I
watched and waited. Presently, to my
utter amazement, the Slgnota also came
to the side scenes. Her official appear
ance on the boards had terminated with
the last act; and, although the audience
was sure to call for their old favorite, as
well as for their new. after the curtain
had fallen, I could not understand why a
lady who had a luxurious dressing room
and comfortable private box at her dis
posal, should- be now drifting about at
the side scenes, even supposing that she
was, like myself, desirous of listening to
her rival's great song.
"I looked closely at the Slgnora. She
was deadly pale under her rouge, her eyes
burned with a wild light, and, as the cur
tain drew us and the rapturous plaudits
of the. audience greeted her rival, I saw
that the Italian clutched her slender,
hands convulsively. 'Thatwoman means
mischief," I thought to myself with a sud
den fear. As the song rose, the jailer,
who was to bring in the bowl of poison
(a good natured Italian boy who was em
ployed In 'dumb show* parts), advanced
to the sido scene with the bowl and stood,
awaiting his cue, to step on the stage.
"Now, Madame had considerable faith
In a certain medicated liquid, a few drops
flash, the Ellgnora's hand traveled to her
thick coils of hair, snatched from their re
cesses a tiny bottle., from which she. emp
tied something Into the bowl, and replaced
the phial In Its hiding-place, before Gia
cone rose with the ring. , - -
"To rush forward and denounce the
woman was my first impulse, but I
promptly checked It. I remembered the
scene, the excitement this would create,
also the inevitable spoiling of Madame's
great effect of the evening. Noâ l would
save my darlingâ but she should enjoy her
triumph all the same; my plan might ruin
my'own prospects, suqh as they, were, but
I would carry It out 'pevertheless. With
a word of thanks to Giacone and a piece
of silver feft In his hand the Signora had
moved away â fiend as she was, she doubt
less *,shrank from beholding her work.
And, obedient to : his cue. Giacone now
stepped on the stage bearing the bowl in
his hands. I watched with eager. eyes. : saw
the singer take the bowl from its prof
ferer- and commence the plaintive lay .In
which she bewailed her fata in dying thus
young and . innocent, and attempted to
summon up resolution to drink the fatal
potion. When the first pause ensued In
her song, as she hesitated to lift the bowl
to her lips. I staggered on the stage with
the gait of simulated drunkenness, and
brandishing my halbert contrived to "dash
the fatal bowl from the singer's hands; it
fell on the stage and Its contents flooded
the scene. There was an indignant cry
from the audience, but Madame, an ex
perienced actress, promptly picked up the
empty bowl, feigned to ralsa it to her lips,
disWtly withdrawing. "^ "JL^S

ghastly that I thought she was about to

I am come to ask you to hand me that
little bottle which you have in your back
hairâ unless you prefer to give It up to
the police.'
" "What bottle, fellow? Are you drunk
or mad?' cried the diva furiously.
" 'The bottle of poison,' I went on. cool
ly 'part of which you recently poured

"A horrible, fiendish gleam of triumph
came over the wretched woman's face.
' " 'Ah! she has drunk of It?' she cried.
"â¢No. she has not, 1 I replied; 'I saw
what you did and saved her without her
knowledge. And she sang her great song
like an angel," I went on cruelly, 'and to
night's will be the greatest triumph she

here for the first time did Madame
meet with an actual rlvaL There was a
very popular native singer residing there,
a dark-eyed, dark-browed signora,' whose
voice, for a contralto, was said to be as
fine as our singer's was for a soprano. To
hear the two prima donnas perform to
gether, was, of course; the great wish cf
the local musical world. An opera was
found or written to display both voices to
their best advantage; and the perform
ance was certainly a magnificent one. The
great scene was one akin to the dialogue
between Hermia and Hermolne in the
'Midsummer Night's Dream,', a 'dialogue
between two jealous rivals, and as a piece
of acting, as well as a musical treat, the
effect" was superb. Our dear English
singer looked like the atigel she was, rep

noticed an obsorbed group, of which Ma

The fame of Major NevJl as a tiger
hunter extends from one end of India to
the other. I entered the smoking-room in
stantly.
"We were encamped clx days' journey
from Calcutta." the major was saying.
"The forests were as thick and Etubborn
Â¦s the hair on a boy's head. For hours I
had struggled through the high grass and
over the monstrous roots of trees. At

"Not many yards ahead were a tiger,

The Â«Ã¼bs frisked about like giant klt

When the cubs collided with her in their

templated this domestic scene with the
fascinated intensity of all who behold a
tiger in Its pride of freedom. The mother

Â¦as clean as a lady's muff. The stripes
cavght the eye in vivid wales, like the

motionless mass of loud color. As I stood
gazing the great eyelids lifted. She leaped
to her feet and beat the ground with one
paw. Quick as herself I aimed my gun at
her heart The bullet barely missed. Once
more I let fly. This time I broke a pro
jecting fang from the jaw of the tigress.
The bullet emerged just beneath her eye.
The beast reared mightily upon her hind
legs- There was no time to reload my
gun. She gasped right in my face. In
desperation I rammed the ' steel barrel Â¦
of my weapon between those foaming
jaws of hers. She knocked it aside as if
It were a match.
"I Etood disarmed within reach of her.
I lifted an arm in puny defense of my
head before her onward rush. She lifted
me as a cat might lift a mouse. Up the
torrent's dry bed she swept, and dashed
me, face downward, to the ground. Plant
ing one paw upon my prostrate form she !
shook me until my skeleton rattled. Her '
object was to break my spine. The claws
of this raging tigress dug Into the ex
posed flesh. Another paw tore my hip. I
was bathed in the blood that flowed from
her Jaws. I lay as helpless as a babe. '.
"I feigned death. The effort was easy
in my abject helplessness, and it saved
my. life.
"My men had not been inactive. One
seized a huge stone and let it fly. The mis
sile struck the tigress full in the face.
The others yelled and danced about us.
The great beast forgot me for an Instant
in the fury of this new provocation. Des
peration gave me a moment's strength. I
picked up my gun and loaded It. One of
my men snatched the weapon. I heard
two shots and then I swooned. Upon my
return to consciousness the tiger lay life
less beside me.
'"What a : release from my agony the *
prospect of death held out: I lay there
impatient to breathe my last, j But the
men were .merciless. They insisted uron
contriving a stretcher from the boughs
and carrying me fifty miles. The*flow of
blood seemed to be draining every vein
in my body. I adopted heroic measures.
A spear was heated redhot and applied
to the wounds. There followed two more
days of agony before that Journey, ended.
Then the doctor said I must lose an arm.
â¢The claw of the tigress had swollen it into
a Kreat bag of festering flesh. But I re
fused the operation; I preferred death.
The member was saved, but it cost me blx
months of torture." â¢
There was silence In the smoking-room.
Every cigar and every pipe had gone out.
"That ended my tiger hunts," concluded
the* major. "I had had enough, even
though my experience was less terrible
than that of Sir Arthur, here.','

Fire Guards for the Paris Exposition
Intending . exhibitors . and visitors from
the United States to the Paris Exposition
in 1900 will be interested in knowing what
arrangements and regulations will be '
made by .the French authorities against
fire. The Paris Exposition administration ;
has taken all the measures possible to af
ford ' security to exhibitors and visitors.
Their regulations are rather voluminous,
containing thirty-six articles distributed
in six chapters.
These regulations take up the openings
and exits and the stairways and doors of
all palaces and buildings. They regulate
the width of doors and steps. All exterior â¢
doors will open in and out. -Doors opening
only inward must remain open constantly.
Emergency doors will bear an inscription
stating their purpose, and In all hallways^
and corridors painted arrows will indicate'
the direction of the exit. An emergency
lighting system for night use will consist
of lamps of one-candle power, bearing the
distinctive red color. All wood of the
framework .in the buildinrs' will be "cov
ered",, with an insulating coat of non-in
flammable material.' All stairways will
be of fireproof material. Â¦
' The floors of . all buildings, : palaces,
theaters, halls, cafes, concert- rooms, ex
hibition places and all railing and,balus
trades ;will" also "be of fireproof material,
and before, accepted will be ; thoroughly
tested . at the expense of the contractors.
All . decorative canvas, l awnings and can
vas coverings must be fireproof. AH elec
tric installation of cables, lamps, wires
and' conductors in . the .. interior', of , t the
buildings must be put In under tha super
vision of the director of exploitation. All
motive' power will ' be admitted only, under
rigid conu*Uona. â¢ The use of celluloid la
lamps, globes, balloons and other fancy
apparatus for lighting decorations will be
forbidden. The ,- regulation i for heating
and lighting provide that it can only be
done by gas or electricity. The use of
hydro-carbons, oils and petroleum, acety
lene gas and other gases than coal gas is
positively f erbidden. either â¢ for heating,
lighting or motive power.
The construction of meeting halls, cafes,
concert halls and theaters must be of fire
proof material â¢ and the theater curtains
must be of iron or asbestos cloth. The
lighting of such places will be exclusively
by electricity. A fire service as nearly
perfect as â¢ possible will be established,
with a watej-plping- and -pressure suffi
cient for firemen's service. The i admin
istration assumes the right to enf ores
any measure that may be deemed necea

Men, according to this Sherlock Holmes,
, are divided into four classesâ those who
. wear silk hats or "tilers," those who wear
, soft hats or Fedoras, those who wear stiff
hats or "beaners," and lastly those who
wear caps or "cappers." The man on
6tilts talks about these different classes
as indicated by their headgear with the
same familiarity as we would speak of
negroes, Chinese or Hottentots. Some of

to be taken with a grain or two of salt
Fundamentally there is a conviction
In him that the top of a man's hat is an
Index to his character. It is as the open
hand to the palmist, or as a thumb-mark
to Pudd'nhead Wilson; it tells allâ a
man's virtues, faults and failinga. It is
the open sesame to every man's disposi
tion.
Take as a starter that class of people
who adorn their heads with the -polished
tileâ purseproud; If the top of the hat bo
smooth and the grain of silk all lies in the
came direction In one unfurrowed smooth
ness* the man underneath Is sure to be of
an even, unruffled disposition, particu
lar as to his appearance and neat in his
dress and habits; on the other "hand, if
the hat is ruffled about the edge and the
crown presents a generally mussy appear
ance, the wearer is careless and of ro
steady purpose. A ruffled edge about the
crown with a smooth center denotes a
nervous and Impulsive man, given to
twisting his hat about in his hand while
trying to appear at his ease. Often a silk
hat is seen which has a small disturbed
looking place on the right-hand side mar

A Miniature of Greatest Historical Interest
O wined toy a
Sam- Framciscairsi.
THERE is an old miniature in our
city that could tell tales if it would.
Day in and day 'out It lies silent in
its soft little plush case, but it looks
steadily forth with the blue eye's of
the longr ago Lord Nelson.
The plush case is securely locked away
in the desk of D. Eisner. Mr. Eisner is a
Geary-street furrier, supposed to know
more about the shade of mink 'and the
quality of seal than he does about art
and curios. But the Nelson miniature Is
the apple of his eye, and It's an apple
that a good many professional collectors
would snap up at the first chance. jfkj:
Two years ago Mr. Eisner chanced upon
the painting. It belonsed to an ignorant
man, who was trying to dispose of it.
The beauty of it attracted Mr. Eisner, and
ho at once offered the man $5.
"I guess you can have it," was the an
swer. "I tried to sell It for the gold of
the frame, but a pawnbroker would give
only 50 cents,"
So it changed hands. But to every
query about the picture's history the man
remained dumb.
Its new owner took it home and showed
it to the family, and l it was admired and
discussed, li is in the form of a- large
oval locket, and the back shows a lock of
light brown hair inclosed in glass. The
glass was broken when Mr. Eisner bought
it. ', Around this is a band of dark blue
enamel, and the whole Is clamped with
gold rivets and made to hang by a ring.
As investigation went on curiosity arose.
If It had been only the faceâ but the lock
of hairâ that was too much.* Romance
crept in. ' There was surely a story shut
up In that locket. The eyes were the kind
that go to make stories. Mr. Eisner re
turned to the seller, '.vj
"I've got to know how you came by that
picture,"- he said.
"Got to", didn't count.but jingling gold
did. 'The price of th" history mounted to
$80. At last all thai as known was told.
The man made a written statement that
the miniature had been given to him by
his mother shortly before she died in IS3G.
She was a lodging-house keeper In Lon
donâGolden square, near Regent street.
A poor woman who had once occupied a
room In her house had been unable to pay
rent due and left the picture, saying that
It was a miniature of the great admiral.
Lord Nelson.; The man himself had lost
Its original case and could tell nothing:
more of it than that "he remembered
there was a picture of two animals on itâ
a lion and another thing with one horn In
the front of its head."
Mr. Eisner returned home all excite
ment with newly stimulated curiosity.
That very; day he began a course of In
vestigation, which he has continued for
the past two years, always missing com
plete proof, yet with ever more favorable
evidence.
Letters "and figures appeared on the
face of the locket, but they were indis
tinct. A strong magnifying glass made
them legible.'; "W. Grimaldi. A. R." at
the left and "1791" at the right
This added interest. Letters and queries
brought forth the information that
Grimaldi was miniature painter to the
Duke and Duchess of York. Photographs
were made of the painting and sent to J.
D. Schenhauser. the expert of Berkeley
square. Mr. Schenhauser visits. America
year after year with his collections and
displays his wares in the Waldorf-Asto
ria, where the wealthiest of curio hunters
flock to see and buy.
He took fourteen months to look into
the matter. Then he wrote that there
wa3 no doubt about the- picture being a
genuine Grimaldi. It was done in the
oxygenized paint used upon copper or
ivory at that time. Furthermore, Grimal
di was the only miniature painter of Lon
don at that period.

But to follow the story of the ducks that
escaped from ox hunters.
Up on the wheat fields they had found
a particularly rich, stack bottom whero
wheat could be shbveln! up with their
broad bills. Close. at -hand was a lagoon.
In the water of which they could rinse
the dust and chaff from their mouths,
without which process it Is Impossible for
a dock to eat dry food. There were no
cattle to be seen anywhere here and. -the
ducks felt safe. Suddenly there was a
crack, a swish and something flew over
their heads. On attempting to fly they
found themselves everywhere overspread
, by a fine meshed web of light string and
thread, which had be en -'drawn over them
llko a. flash from wftero It. had been con
cealed in the light straw of the stack
Â¦ bottom.' ; '-. :.Â¦' .-' >:;â¢". - .;. ; - Â¦..-.. :.!-. : .
Such ducks, as had hot been caught
in the net gave Â«p> any attempt at break
fast.for the day. and went out Into the
lagoon to hunt for water .- -grass and wild
rice, which had escaped the amphibious
carp. A large number of ducks speedily
succeeded in finding some very toothsome
bits of "raw potato, which when swallowed
disclosed the fact thÂ»t each piece of
potato contained a hook, to which was
attached a. string tied to a rope at the
bottom of the pond. The merry antics of
the tied ducks speedily brought all of
their fellows, who thought that a lively
game of water tag was Â¦ in ' progress, and
as ducks can or will give no. warning of
danger, all the curious sightseers were
Boon each on a airing themselves and
when the last hook had been swallowe.l

What chance has the duck against the

Among th* art treasures left behind by

Saved by a Cat.
Score one for pussy. A Bristol, En?.,
cat a few days ago proved. the means of
saving a whole family from destruction
by fire. At half past two in the morning
a shopkeeper named Ledo Schnledermann
was aroused by his pet tabby, which was
gently scratching his face.
He tried to drive her away, bat as the
faithful feline persisted, he aroused him
self, to find the room full of smoke. He
alarmed a lodger, Herman Muller, who
was sleeping on the same floor, and also
his sister I and another young woman.
They all rushed to the stairs, where th*
flames were already spreading.
With the exception of the lodger, th*
inmates, taking puss with them, reached
â¢ landing, from which they escaped to
the back yard. Just as the flames shot
light through the spiral staircase Muller,
who had stopped to put on his boots, .was
cut off from escape. The flames reached
hlÂ« room, and then, throwing out some
bedding, he leaped from the second-story
window. He badly sprained his ankle,
and was taken to the infirmary.
so the gentleman took to stilts, and on
stilts he has been ever since, except on
rainy days, when the streets are slippery
and there Is an uncertainty of equilib
rium.
He wears a placard on his back setting
forth the virtues of porous plasters, baby
food or clears, as the fickle public may
desire. In many cities has he stalked the
crowded thoroughfaresâ in bustling New
York, sleepy Philadelphia, prosaic Boston,
malted St. Louis,, and finally casting his
shadow on the cobblestones of San Fran
cisco. His life is not an easy one as he
struts about the streets above the stings
and slurs of those beneath him. Small
boys after school have pelted him with
thÂ« remainder of their noonday meal, and
some, more American .than the rest, have
even essayed to hurl stones prettily done
up in checkered lunch-napkins. Men in
their cups have tottered against his wood
en spindle-shanks and upset him. Funny
men always perpetrate the same old joke,
"How Is the weather up there?" and
many more are the indignities heaped
upon this veritable Ichabod Crane,, but
he goes about his business with a serene
dignityâ a dignity which would do honor
to an Empress of China picking mul
berries. He Is a firm believer in law and

the top; the man. who is found under this
kind of a hat can be immediately set
down as one who does not, as a rule,
wear a tile; the ruffled place is caused by
the wearer's ineffectual endeavor to re
move his hat as he would his every-day
soft one.
Then, of course, there is the good hat
gone wrong, like the owner, and the
shabby genteel "seen-better-days" hat
which is a bad endeavor to go right. Â¦ .

The somber black soft hat, when set
squarely on the head, denotes a ministerâ
if jauntily on the side, a gambler. But
the man with the cap is the greatest
problem of them all; the most irresponsi
ble, the most erratic. There are two
classes of cap, wearersâ the rlÂ£h and the
poorâ the rich of the richest and the poor
of the poorest; The man of the better
class who wcd-i i cap goes swinging
along with his a . In the air. his hands
deep in his pocket*. ' He stops at the cor
ner, turns about, retraces his steps, stops
again, looks in a shop window, lights a
cigarette, goes back to the original cor
ner, looks up anQ down the street, and
then dodges into a saloon. Purely a gen
tleman of leisure, in search of amuse

He of the "other half." the poorer man,
smokes a pipe, black and strong, walks
slowly along, his hands behind his back
and observes nothing in particular; most
likely a retired coal heaver too old to
work. â¢> Â¦
And so this man on stilts goes about
this busy world, calculating his steps and
observing the men who pass below him
like so many ants beneath a tall and
slender sapling. The present, past and
future ia as an open book upon the top of
their heads. - ,
Withal he Is a modest man. "I do not
like newspaper notoriety," said he to me
one day, preparatory to a constitutional
which he was about' to take. "I am an

tive about what I do, and desire that I
lead an upright life."
"So long," answered I, and then I pass

The career of this gentleman of high
life Is Interesting, and when he tells it, it
Is as long and drawn out as himself. His
etllt-walklng propensities were first de
veloped when he found himself somewhat
down la the world In Chicago.. An ordi
nary man and only some 5 feet 1 1nches In
fceight. The pity of it. - .
Chicago was at that time In the throes
of her development and evolution toward
c . purchased culture and . refinement.
Pork packing was at its zenithâ the very
Zocus of refinement . This . movement
toward better things did not affect this
lowly Individual In the least. Something
tad- to be done, end that quickly. And
he bore upon his left arm as a shield.
Through an opening in It there projected
the barrel of a pumpgun.
The ox was driven to the bank and
hitched to a large Bled with a crockery
crate on It: then the ox pulled the sled
out into the shallow pond to where the
ducks lay thickest on the water.
"Pretty. near 400, I guess; most of them
Â¦ small ones, though. Bay, Browning, I veil
you these two-barreled guns ain't in it,
an' they're against the law' besides. Tell
you what:. I'm going to get them to make
- me a twelve-barreled 10-gauge gun, and
have every barrel pointing in a little dif

whole flock and take my pick. -This biz
,of having 10,000 ducks right under your'
nose and only getting a couple of hundred
and half of them smallâ does not suit^
me." The first scatter-wide shotgun was
made to order, with diverging multi
barrels. It has one hammer which fires
the first barrel; that automatically fires
the second, and so the twelve go, seriatim,
making a continuous roar. Then it takes
half a day to pick up the ducks. i
This, mind you, can only be done where
ducks are plentiful. The hunter on the
Alvarado marshes or the Suisun preserves
does not see such sights as the market
hunter of San Joaquin is accustomed to.
The Kern lakes are more properly now* a
marshâ shallow pools, a foot or so In
depth, and lying in groups and chains,
with tules, reeds, cattails and wild rice
growing in and about them. Through
these tul<* patches, which are as dense as
Indian Jjngles. there are always thou
sands of cattle from the great stock
ranches adjoining. The ducks become used
to the cattle, end after a while they pay
no attention to them. The hunters soon
learned this and trained oxen to walk out
and act as stalking horses are used by
deer hunters. The bottoms .of the pools
are fairly firm, and one can wade for
miles through the open water, never find
ing a deep or miry place.
The Idea of the cannon on the ox's back
was an Improvement In all directions, and
so the market hunters had pack saddles
made with stout swivel guns mounted
upon them, and in this way. divided the
labor of hunting. V**v- H â¢ Â¦
Another duck hunter made himself a
lake dwelling after the manner of the pre
historic Swiss. He built a house on piles
in the lake and thatched it from roof
ridge to water's edge with long tules. He
"put a fence of wire netting around the
house at a distance of a hundred feet or
more then got some tame ducks and
turned them loose inside with their wings
clipped.
Sitting comfortably with slippers and
pipe before the fire, he enjoyed some of
the most luxurious and successful duck

if she. will ever be used by the Presidential

sion on the little boat and its seagoing

low decks, which are used as sleeping
apartments for the officers and for the
guests aboard the vessel. These apart
ments are finished In white, and In con
sideration of the comparatively small
amount of sunlight that enters are very
bright and pretty. There Is also a minia
ture dining room and a kitchen as well
as quarters for th* men bÂ«low decks.

The Sylph is essentially warlike In her
construction, and her conversion into a
pleasure yacht In these piping times of
peace has not resulted in the entire re
moval of all the traces of the exciting
times and bellicose purpose for which she
was built. When one goes aboard this
fact is noted in the strong steel gratings
which protect her hatches and the small
business-like portholes fashioned less for
light and air than for protection.

It Is true that the President's yacht Is
%o stanchly built that she could weather
eafely almost any gale which Bhe might
meet m the turbulent waters of the At
lantic, and that she is seaworthy In every
forth In somewhat solitary state aboard
hla craft. â¢ . ' .
To me Lieutenant Maxwell detailed the
history of the Sylph. It seem.* that she
was built by John Roach & Co. of Ches
ter, Pa., and waa originally designed for
use as a pleasure yacht. Â¦ .During the
course of her construction it was deter
mined to fit her up as a vessel of the aux
iliary navy, Pier construction was some- '.
what changed and she waa hurried to
completion. Her builders sold her to the..
United States Government for JoO.OOO, and
on August 19, 1.-DS, the very day of the
signing of the protocol between' this coun
try and Spain, she went Into commission
a.-5 one of the mosquito fleet. Her com
mander was Lieutenant A. Gartley of
Philadelphia, an officer of the volunteer
service, and under him she did duty along
the Atlantic coast for a while as on* of
Â¦tie fleet of small patrol boats then com
snanded by. Captain J. R. Bartiett.
At that time the- President had been
snatching a few hours from his multifar
ious official duties and running down tho
Potomac aboard one of the ordnance tugs
to set a little rest and recreation. It was
thought that some more suitable vessel
pf the navy should be provided for the
Chief Executive. Accordingly the little
fighting yacht was brought around to
Washington. Shortly after Lieutenant
Gartley brought her around he was mus
tered out of the service, and Lieutenant
Maxwell succeeded him. He has remained
In command ever since.
Lieutenant Maxwell has made consider
able changes of a minor nature in the
Sylph. He has had three of the four
Hotchkiss guns with which she was fitted
up removed, leaving only the one on the
forward deck. This gives more ample
room to the White House parties, who
almost invariably spend their time aboard
the yacht aboveboard. on the pretty and
spacious decks. He has also thoroughly
overhauled the boat from stem to stern,
cleaning every nook and cranny and hav
ing the wood and metal work polished
until It shines like a mirror. The condi
tion In which the Sylph Is kept Is cer
tainly a tribute to the lieutenant's genius
for housekeeping. â¢â¢ ''..'Â¦.â¢.â¢'
Mr. McKlnley has scarcely evinced the
fondness for the water that was displayed
by his predecessor In offlce. It may be
that his ardent application to business
and the vast amount of work which has
fallen on him prevents- hts making use
of the Sylph as much as he would other
wise like to do. As it Is, he has taken no
very extended trips aboard her, preferring
rather to run down the river to Mount
Vernon during the course of the after
noon or evening. Occasionally the trips
of the Presidential party are extended
farther down to Indian Head, or even as
far as Quantlco and Broadwater, some
forty miles down, where President Cleve
land used to go In the fall for duck hunt-
Ing and fishing. . ' . â¢ .
Almost Invariably the President Is ac- i
companied on these little excursions by
Mrs. McKlnley, who Is said to be very
fond of the water, and Is aulte a sailor.
Very often thÂ© young people visiting the
White House accompany the party and
sometimes one or more of the members
of the Cabinet. A great many very pleas
ant social gatherings of this nature take
.place aboard the Sylph In the spring, sum
mer and autumn.
It is only occasionally that the Presi
dent makes use of hl3 yacht In winter.
At times, however, he places It at tha
disposal of prominent diplomats or offi
cial visitors to this country. On the 23d
of January. 1599. she took the President
of Costa Rica down to Mount Vernon.
She was also placed at the disposal of the
Joint High Commission, which met In
Washington last year to determine the
Canadian boundary dispute, and they
spent a whole day aboard her oa the
Potomac, From time to time she does a
great deal of work of this kind and proves
herself a moat useful and rateable vessel.

is a historical romance dealing with the
invasion of Wales during the time of
King Henry I of England. It offers an
interesting picture of the times and the
people," showing In an entertaining way
the intense feeling of national pride ex
isting among the Welsh, as well as their
stern determination to resist all encroach
ments on their liberties by the English.
In addition to this national patriotism
there Is, perhaps, a still stronger feeling
of local pride that can induce the humble
tenant to sacrifice his all for the sake of
his priept and' oppose to the utmost of
his ability the attempt to connect the
Church of Wales with that of England.

The Sad Story of the Life of Felix Morris.
ONCE upon a time a runaway young
ster set out for America to revolu
tionize the stase. He was Felix
Morris. He did not consider him
self a youngster, for he had a medical
"ploma to his credlt-a diploma from
parlor one Christmas night and had his
efforts not been applauded |Â»> Cous'n
Mary and Uncle Charles and Susie Harl
ot the father of Felix Morris did not
look with favor upon a stage career. He
was an officer in th 9 British navy and a
.onservative parent. "Felix shall by a
physician." he had said. Then his lips
came together as if they meant business.
,and to a medical school Felix went. Â¦
â¢But his taste of amateur theatricals
Vis the undoing of paternal plans. X
followed that Felix determined upon the
â¢tage for his career. ,Â»,âÂ«_
â¢To the intense disappointment of those
-who had a right to expect better things
of me." he says. "I- started for the United
i States, with very little money In my
pocket but fortified with a supply Â°f de
termination and ambition which I had
never displayed in any previous undertak
. "in ray optimistic eyes my future was
assured, for of worldly wisdom I bad
none, and of practical common sense I re
joiced in the possession of a very short
allowance. Thus equipped. I set out to
revolutionize the stage."
It came about that he chose Albany as
the place to make his start. His first in
terview with an Albany manager was noi
encouraging. Upon calling the manager's
attention to the fact that a future Keane
or Macready might be before him. the
answer made was: "A fellow with such a
xnu* as yours play tragedy? Bosh! No,
sir; if you go Into this business you
may in fourteen or fifteen years be re
ceiving $15 per week, and you'll be pretty
doggoned lucky if you do that."
Then followed the years of world bat
tle. Morris accepted a position as drug
clerk, when the wolf camped before his
door. He worked in a Boston foundry
tintll he fell at his work and was taken
to a hospital for eight weeks. He shipped
with a Pacific whaler, but gave up the
voyage before land was out of reach.
Once during these years he had been
given a chance upon the stage. "Roland
Hetherington, I arrest you," was the
chance.
He came upon the stage and was car
ried off again, having eald not a word,
for sheer terror. This performance did
not put him In the line of promotion.
It was not until long after that Wal
ter Keeble assumed the management of
the Albany Theater and sent for fcJa
friend. Morris, to be head super, at JS
per week. The super work w,i3 success
ful, and a role of policeman folio-wed.
Next he became a "snide lawyer" oa thÂ»
Albany stage. â¢ Â¦ â¢ .
The character work suited audience*,
but It took Morris many a year to learn
that he was not a cominff tragedian. Ills
futile ambition drove him -front pillar to
post, and a desperata season found hlra
traveling with a road company, playtr.s
any left-over part, as well as thÂ« bass
drum. At last cama his San Francisco
engagement.
It was at thÂ» old California Theater.un
der the management of Barton Hill. and
Frank Lawler. During the season, of
IS7B-79 he played there a3 character come
dian, and it was during that season that
he made the San Francisco friends who
remember him best now. He made but
one_ failure, and that went no further
than* a rehearsal.

"The comic opera 'Fatinitza" was to bÂ«
presented, and I was cast for the reporter,
the leading tenor part. I told Barton Hill
that I was not an operatic tenor. 'Never
mind, my boy; it is a good part, a good
part,' said he. 'You'll bÂ«Â» all right.' I
took the liberty of doubting this asser
tion very much, and when my voice was
tried, it was at once discovered that In
stead of being all right. It was all wronff.
The part was given to tin well-known
tenor Harry Gates, after the verdict of
Charlie S^hultz. our musical director.
" 'Ouf you sing like dot. you git hell.' Â¦
Followfng the stock season came barn
storming in "The Octoroon." Morris played
with Maud Adams, who was making her
little-girl appearance as Paul, the Indian
boy. Mr. Gates reminded him of this
fact last season. "Do you know, Felix,
that New York's darling. Lady Babbie,
is the ' Indian boy of your *Octorooa*
days 7" - ; :
"No! You don't say so!", nodded Mor
ris. "How we grow, how we growl"
It was aa Softie in "Aurora Floyd" that
Morris* first real hit was made. After
that, success was easy. Daniel. Frohman
engaged him for the stock company, and
vaudeville circuits brought in good ring
ing coin. But the man who had Â«truirled
for success -was almost aid when it came.

without warning, ejected from his place
as Archprleat and condemned to death
by the unscrupulous Bishop appointed by
Henry I, his wife passed over to* the

By the aid of his friends Pabo escaped

dwelling of an aged hermit. Here he dis
covered a chart directing the way to the
treasure left In the cave of Ogofau by the
ancient Romans. This was treasure to be
used only In defense of Wales, and Pabo
gladly consecrated It to the cause of ex

plot of the book develops in the attempts
made by Pabo's friends to conceal from
the Bishop and his satellites thelrpriest's.

vent the Bishop from putting Into execu

supremacy goes side "by side with the
great struggle for political autonomy and
the defense of Welsh homes against seiz

Is reached -when the plgnal Is given to take
up arms, and the images that follow are
filled with that intense local patriotism
and strong love for clan so characteristic
of the Welsh, the clans of the Scottish

with a stern resolve that atones for these

the great Germanic race." Mrs. Sherratt
must be very amiable, indeed, to endure
such a pun even from herself. (Rand, Mc-
Nally & Co., Chicago.)
Against the fundamental principle ex
pressed In "The School nnd Society."- by
Professor John Dewey of the University
of Chicago, no thoughtful student of edu
cation will be likely to make any protest.
This principle is that the school is a part
of social life and must train its pupils for
social usefulness. As a result, the school
must conform its education more closely
to the social conditions of the age.

"The obvious fact is that our social life
has undergone a thorough and radical
< hanpe. If our education is to have any
meaning for life It must pass through
an equally complete transformation. This
transformation Is not something to ap
pear suddenly, to be executed in a day by
conscious purpose. It is already in prog
ress. The modifications of our school sys
tem which appear often as mere changes
of detail, mere improvements within the
school mechaiilsm, are In reality signs
and evidences of this change. The In
troduction of active occupations, of na
ture study, of elementary science, of art.
of history, the relegation of the merely
symbolic and formal to a secondary po
sition; the change in the moral school
atmosphere. In the relation of pupils and
teachersâ of discipline; the Introduction
of more active, expressive and self-direct
ing factorsâ all these are not mere ac
cidents; they are necessities of the larger
social evolution. It remains but to or
ganize all these factors, to appreciate
them in their fullness of meaning, and
to put the ideas and Ideals Involved In
complete, uncompromising possession of
our school system. To do this means to
make each of our schools an embryonic
community life, active with types of
occupations that reflect the life of so
ciety and permeated throughout with the
spirit of art, history and science. When
the school introduces and trains each
chiid of society into membership within
such a little community, saturating him
with the spirit of service and providing
him with the instruments of effective self
direction, we shall have the deepest and
best guarantee of a laYger society which
is worthy, lovely and harmonious."
When we come to analyze the meaning
The picture of this gently noble man.
modestly unconscious of his worth, is
touching and inspiring. Sirs. Sherratt de
scribes him as saying: "If I could only
go to your country! But I never shall;
60 I must work it out for myself." And
as her party went down the street they
looked back and "saw him standing
thoughtfully in the doorwayâ a grand iig
ure In his Ehabby garmentsâ and I
thought of the many Americans I had
known to whom years of college and for
eign university life had not given that
discipline of the Intellect, that real edu
cation, which had been acquired by this
pnor Indian 'working it out' in his lonely
home on the distant mountain." â¢

The thoroughgoing consistency with
which these conceptions are worked out
In Professor Dewey's little school gives
rise to Eome questions. Is Professor
Dewey not carried away by the Idea of
evolution? Is any such consciousness of
the stone age as he would develop es-
Eential to useful activity in the world of
to-day? It is to-day that a child must
earn his living as a specially trained
workman In some business. As an edu
cational factor almost any manual train
ing will do its work for him, developing
hiÃ sense of form and making him feel
a respect for handiwork. The knowledge
of ancient weaving and of primitive'con
ditions may be usful knowledge, too: but
It will hardly reconcile a man who stands
eight hours a day. tending a clacking,
monotonous mechanism for making tacks
to being obliged to do part of the world's
tedious labor, as Professor Dewey seems
to suggest. There appears to be some
vagueness, also, about the extent to

might fittingly be applied to. the
college whose doors swing wide
welcome for both men and women.
The co-eds are numberless at the
University of . Californiaâ they
â¢warm like bees In this hive of learning.
"How doth the busy bee?" is answered 1n
college records. 'Tis written that not a
Sew co-eds have carried off the gold med
aJ for scholarship, and many have been
graduated with honors -that make their
brothers' records look like the wrong erd
of a 22â0 football score.
Much is known of the co-eds* feats of
scholarship, but outsiders wist little of the
co-ed's life nor wot of her Joys and sor
rows. The co-ed of to-day Is leagues
apart from the co-ed of yesterday. The
pioneer co-ed was the woman with an un
cuenchable thirst for knowledge. She
scorned ribbons and ruffles for 'isms and
'ologies, and became a silver mine for the
penny-a-liners of the comic papers. But
she has been shelved to gather the dust
end cobwebs with the back numbers that
Inked her In verse and cartoon.
The co-ed of to-day Is too complex a
creature for the humorist's pen. There
are as many types of co-eds as there are
years in the college course. Those who
Â«!o not come In under any of these four
types are dubbed "freaks," and are good
naturedly "Joshed" through college an 4
Che Blue and Gold,
;. L*t uÂ» first consider tho co-ed that h&Â»
earned that title of doubtful complimentâ
a "dig." She is of nearest kin to the col
lege girl of yesterday's jests and Jeers. A
"dig" plows through her books early ani
late, never cuts a lecture or trips on an
answer. She Is usually shabby at elbow
and down at heel, for woman's looks are
the only looks for which she has no eyes.
The "dig" reaps a harvest of crowsfeet
and much commendation from the august
faculty; after that an aftermath of re
grets, for the "dig" who has only lived to
learn ofttimes learns to live â with people
as well as books. "Digs" have been heard
to confess that there is such a thing as
being "faultily faultless" in college work.
Another, and the most pleasing of all the
types of college girls, is the girl of splen
did physical and mental poise, who finds
some time for play during her college
work. She is bright and studious, stands
well with the faculty and is popular with
the students. She dresses well, is usually
tailor-made and exact in the niceties of
collars and cuffs, dear to co-eds' hearts;
she goes to all the college dances and ia as
feathery on her feet as the fluffy maiden

who doesn't know a logarithm from a log.

The day was bitterly cold 'and the sun
was partly obscured by a hazy cloud or
miEt which hung ovt-r the city, .when
the writer descended from the end of
the North Capitol street car line and, ac
cording to appointment, found Dr. Calver
and several of the gentlemen interested
in his enterprises. He accompanied the
gentlemen to the laboratory, where Dr.
Calver has labored off and on for the
past twenty yearE. The first of the doc
tor's experiments, it might be remarked,
were carried on in the Territory of Ari
zona.
The party went behind a large mansion
and entered an inclosure of considerable
size. This was surrounded ,by a board
fence so high as to exclude the possibil
ity of any one gaining access except
through permission. Within a Bight was
presented such as cannot be duplicated
on tbe face of the globe. It was novel
and Interesting to a degree and had it
not been somewhat anticipated the mean
ing of the whole thing would have bewil
dered and puzzled any of the greatest sci
entific men.
At the center of the inclosure etood a
rrr.all square house, built roughly of wood
and so elevated on posts as to somewhat
resemble a water tank. From this, as the
most familiar and friendly object, the
eye of the stranger wanders around what
finally appears to be a circular wooden
track. And on this track are located
mirror frames and mirrors. Of the frames
there were, it appeared on count, only
seven or eight. But of the mirrorsâ there
appeared to be thousands of them. They
were not great big burnished glasses with
which 'one would naturally expect to catch
the rays of the sun for fuel; but number
less little fellows, four inches by Fix. Dr.
Calver 6aid they were. These were set In
rows one above another in a frame whose
general structure was slightly convex.
Opposite the entrance to the laboratory.
which ceemed to bs about a half acre in
extent, stood the largest of the mirror
ly sun power.... Ir. the present machine,
there are twenty-seven tows of thirty
mirrors each, or SIO mirrors in all. These!
glasses are common, ordinary flat inir- )
rors, which could be" manufactured for a
few pennits' each, and are perhaps Chs
most expensive par: of the appliance.
They are set in rows, and by means of a
Aimple gearing can all be concentrated
oh one point "'at the same time-that is,
they will all reflect the rays of the sun
upon a single point out there in the yard,
for example.
"Now. as the eanh moves in the course
of the day these mirrors would soon get
out cf focuÃ. The remedy for this is elm-
pie enough. I move my frame around on
the circular trax-k. In practice it moves
easily ai:d ore man can attend to an
acre of glass per .day, keeping it all fo
cused upon the same point.
"You ask how we store the heat and
keep it for use on rainy and cloudy day*.
That is easy enough when you under
stand tbe principle on which the reser
voir works. This etores heat and keeps
It for use jupt as ice 5s stored. The con
centrated rays of the sun are thrown
through two thicknesses of glass upon
a dark inner 6lirÂ£ace. The heat is caught,
so to speak, and retained in the sub
stance at the center, which may be stone,
earth or anything likely to prove the
cheapest and beet non-conductor of neat
in the vicinity where the reservoir is be
ing built- In the small reservoir there I
have stored heat and kept the tempera
ture within high enough to boil water at
the end of a week. A larger reservoir
would prove more efficient and Jess
wasteful of heat than the one I have
here.
"There arÂ© ISO square feet of glass In
this frame. That means the reflection of
130 feet of sunlight. The combined force
of the other htliornotore in the yard about
their commercial possibilities. That these
gentlemen have before them a rle^d for
exploitation that eur^asses the bounds of
the human imagination every one know*
who will contemplate for a. moment the
far-reaching consequences of the unlver
fcal introduction of any power which can
be furnished in unlimited quantities at a
nominal cost. In short, if their schemes
are practicable, th- work of the world as
known to-da* - wHI hereafter be performed
by the giant Sirnpower gratis.
And yet when one visits the laboratory
which Dr. Calver has erected in the out
skirts cf Washington, as the writer has
done within the week, and views there the
methods by which this harnessing of the
pun's ray? Is to be brought about and has
the scientific principlep on which the sun
power machine has been constructed ex

REITZ'S APPEAL TO

lish extracts from a remarkable document
emanating from the offlce of the Secre
tary of State at Pretoria, dated December
16. The document comprises 10,000 words
and is countersigned by Secretary of
State >Reltz. It seems specially written
for the American public. It says:
"We, to a- great -extent, depend on America
and Europe- for our foodstuffs. It will be crim
inal on. the part of the great powers to suffer
this little - nation â¢to perish by famine, t since
the sword has failed. Since IS7O, when the

MODDER , RIVER, Feb. 3.â The Boers
yesterday were busy destroying: the rail
way bridge between here and i Langeburg
from a point 2000 yards from the British
advanced position. - Thirty-three explo
sions were heard, and doubtless the line
and culverts were wrecked for a consider
able distance. Â¦â¢ Â¦ . Â»Â¦
LOXDOX, Feb. 4 .â Has
General Buller again crossed
Â¦ the Tugela? Has he begun
another attempt to pound his
way to Ladysmith? These are
questions which are occupying
the minds of all British subjects.
There is as yet no official confir
mation of the reports which have
t>een published that the Xatal
commander has crossed the Tu
gela and made a simultaneous at
tack on the Boer positions at
three different points. There is
no official confirmation even of
the statement that he has begun
his forward movement, but the
silence for two days is regarded
in military circles as significant.
The St. James Gazette last
night repeated, the statement
from private sources which it
m2de two days ago about Buller
having engaged in battle with the
Boers.
Putting this and that together,
his speech on Monday to War
ren's men when he said he hoped
a week would see them in Lady
smith and the reconnoissance to,
Hongers Poort, it is regarded as
a sign of Buller's intention to try
a turning movement of wider
radius than the one which failed.
All these are considered . indica
tions that. he. is trying his for
tunes in the hazard of battle and
that during the last forty-eight
hours events of tremendous im
portance have been happening in
Xatal.
Thus . the country is waiting
with anxiety, but still with more
hope than during the previous
periods of silence which preceded
other big actions. The reason
for more hope is because it is as
sumed that General Buller would
be little likely to have entered
iipon a venture certain to be very
costly unless there were reason
able prospects of success.
A feeling that great events are
in progress is in the air. People
LONDON. Feb. 4â Spencer ' Wilkinson
writes the following review of the situa
tion in South Africa for the Associated
Press at midnight:
"It is morally impossible for Buller's
army, so long as there is any fight left
in it. to sit 'still while Sir George White
is invested at Ladysmith. Better than
that would.be to lose 10,000 men In an at
tempt at relief. Accordingly,' it Is prob
able that General Buller will try again,
and, indeed, that he is now on the move
and fighting.
"As he has kept General Lyttleton's
brigade north of the river,, the probabil
ity is that his next move will bÂ« an ad
vance on Lyttleton's right. He would
hardly go to Lyttleton's left, because that
would only lead to a fresh attack upon
Splon Kop. and the range of which it is
a part. He would not go to the east of
Colenso, except with his whole force, less
Barton's brigade. The retention of Lyt
tleton's brigade at Potgieters Drift may,
therefore, be taken as proof that the
new move will not be to the east of Co
lenso. <â¢ v*;.
"East of Potgleters there are several
drifts, one or two of which General
Buller's guns command, and he can.
therefore, cross the river, bu; the Boens
have had ample time to prepare positions
beyond the river.
"A frontal attack would, as usual, be
costly, but unless the general is prepared
for a heavy loss he has little chance of
breaking through the Boer defenses.
""The 'right "plan would be that made by
General Sherman when he pushed back
Johnson from Chattanooga to Atlanta.
Sherman Intrenched along. Johnson's front
and then extended his line to one of the
flanks. By the time Sherman was ready
to move a force around behind his en
trenched line to attack Johnson in the
flank and threaten his retreat the Con
federate general withdrew. Such tactics
are practicable with only a force numer
ically superior. We do not know the
strength of the Boers in Natal. Winston
Churchill estimates them at only; 19,000, of
whom 7000 are observing Ladysmith. This
would give Buller 25,000 against 12.000, and
should render possible- something like
Sherman's maneuvers. But there Is rea
son to believe that Butter's own estimate
of the Boer forces is rauch higher.
"Lord Roberts .will certainly not hurry
his move from the Cape. He will first
complete the assembling of his forces,
which will not all have arrived for an
other three weeks. Then _he will have
transports properly organized and in
working order before he will start. After
are waiting at the clubs and in
sloppy and sleety streets and
around newspaper offices for
news which has not yet come, but
whichmay arrive at any moment.
Again come those stories that
the Free Staters are heartily tired
of the war. .There is an addition
to the. story this time that they
have approached British authori
ties with a view of ascertaining
terms of peace if they throw over
their Transvaal allies.

GREAT BRITAIN IN
MOST DESPERATE STRAITS
NEW YORK; Feb. 3.â A special to the
World from London says: To compre
hend the desperate pass to which Great
Britain has been brought by the present
administration of the Government a visit
to Parliament suffices. A nerveless, re
sourceless, discomfited, despondent Cab
inet is confronted in the House of Com
mons by a divided, disorganized, futile
opposition.
Mr. Balfour, the Government leader, is
alternately sunk in a posture of gloomy
collapse or galvanized into a sickening
appearance of Inane cheerfulness, recall-
Ing the vacant gayety of demented
Ophelia.
Mr. Chamberlain's notion of braving the
crisis is to adopt a fixed expression of
contemptuous amusement, which, under
the strain of long continuance, develops
into an Indescribably repellant, corpse
like grin.
For the rest, the treasury bench array
(the Ministers) consists of deadheads, a
mixture of Lord Salisbury's aristocratic
placement and pension hunters, with Mr.
Chamberlains family party of nonentities
âtwo castes physically In contrast, but
alike in intellectual feebleness and vacu
ity."
The only man among them who shows
real courage and unaffected equanimity,
combined with a full comprehension of tho
ghastly gravity of the situation and prac
tical statesmanship In attempting to cope
with it, is young George Wyndham, the
Under Secretary for War, who may prove
the salvation even of the British War De
partment.
In the House of Lords the same melan
choly evidences of palsied grasp of effete
Ministers are observable. Lord Salisbury
is like a man dazed by a staggering blow.
His lapses are not into levity, but his
manner suggests sheer inability to appre
ciate what has happened and what it may
portend. He talks and lboks like one in
a dream or condition of only semi-con
sciousness. It is a painful, pathetic spec
tacle.
Lord Rosebory appeared to hold out a
promise of filling- the. yawning 'gap, .but
his activities are 'spasmodic. He makes
a- speech evincing' power t and .'spirit and'
then dlsaiÂ»j>-ar*; an unlimited time_ his 1
vanky- oÂ«ini,'saeÂ»iisned by momentary
sensation he has' created.' Ho Is a master
In words and pose, but a trifler.'an idler,
without pluck or tenacity, and his, life,
strange as it may appear. Is something
of a mystery. .

posed as an organized imposture. The

him.
Shortly after this Dr. Tallaferro left the
room and. descending the stairs, entered
the ladies' reception room, where, at the
request of several ladiesâ wives of legis
latorsâhe held brief services. Then the
divine again went to. Mr. Goebel's bedside
and about five minutes afterward took
his departure. Shortly after 4 o'clock
the dying man was again given oxygen
and again a slight, rally resulted, but It
was only temporary.
At 6:10 p. m. Dr. Hume left the dying
man's bedside and reported to the throngs
of anxious watchers In the corridors of
the hotel that death was a matter of but
a few momenta time. Tne oxygen treat
ment was used constantly in a desperate
effort to keep Mr. Goebel alive until Jus
tus Goebel's arrival, but no effort was
made to arouse the unconscious man.
As Dr. Hume departed from the room
the afflicted brother and. sister turned to
Dr. McCormack and requested that they
be left entirely alone with their brother,
who was fast sinking. . Â¦'Â¦,'.' J.
The physicians silently withdrew, clos
ing the door softly behind them upon tha
grief-stricken brother and sister. Silently
they knelt at his bedside, their eyes fas
tened upon the half-open eyelids of tha
unconscious man. while the life that had
been battling so valiantly against the as
sassin's bullet since last Tuesday morn
ing Bickered out. Death claimed its vic
tim, and the brother and sister, bowed
by sorrow, whose pangs were Intensified
by the knowledge that a few miles away
hurrying to them was their brother Jus
tus, who would arrive too late, sat down
upon the deathbed alone with their dead.
Not a sound emanated from the room to
apprise the anxious watchers In the ho
tel corridor without that Mr. Goebel had
passed away.
The stricken brother and sister werÂ© left
undisturbed while tho two physicians out
side the door anxiously looked at their
watches as the minutes fled by, fearing
the truth yet wondering at the lons si
lence. Finally, at 7:20 o'clock, thÂ© train
bearing Justus Goebel pulled Into Frank
fort. At the station to meet him were
Samuel J. Shackelford. clerk of the Court
of Appeals, and Mayor Rhinoch of Ccv
ington. They met Air. Goebel at the car
steps.
"Is he deadâ tell me. Is. he dead?" werÂ©
the first words he uttered. "He Is not
dead," was the assurance given him by
the friends, who had no Inkling of tho
truth.
The party entered a carriage, and flve>
minutes later, at 7:23 o'clock, arrived at
the Capitol Hotel. "With tears streaming
from his eyes Mr. Goebel was conducted
to the chamber where lay hl3 brother.
The rap at the door was answered by
Arthur Goebel. who silently drew hla
brother within and again closed the door.
Five minutes later Arthur Goebel again
opened the door and motioned to the two
physicians.
"He died at 6:46 o'clock painlessly," wa3
all he said, and then closed tho door.
There was no excitement in the- corridor.
Those who heard the words of Arthur
Goebel were reverently silent and did not
disseminate the intelligence. Within a few
moments the following announcement had
been prepared and was silently handed
about the hotel and in the streets:
To the PeoDle of Kentuclcj: It Is with thÂ»
most profound sorrow that we announce tfiÂ«
death of. Governor William GoebeL In his last
moments be counseled his friends to keep coot
and bow to the law In all things. We. his
friends and advisers, beg of the people of Ken

FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 3.â The bul
let fired by an unknown assassin
last Tuesday morning ended the
life of William Goebel at 6:45
o'clock this evening. The only
persons present at *the death bed
were Mr. Goebel's sister, Mrs. Braun
acker, and his brother, Arthur Goebel, of
Cincinnati, who have been In constant at
tendance at Mr. Goebel's bedside, and
Dr. McCormack. Justus Goebel, another
brother,, who haÂ» been hurrying from
Arizona as fast as steam would carry
him, In a vain hope of reaching his dying
brother in time for some token of recog
nition, arrived forty minutes too late.
Oxygen was frequently administered the
dying man during the afternoon In an
effort to keep him alive until hla brother's
arrival, but in vain. For, by the cruel
Irony of fate, the train on which Justus
Goebel was traveling to Frankfort was
delayed several hours from various
causes, and when Mr. Goebel finally
reached here It was only to learn that his
brother was dead. Among bitter parti
sans of both parties deep grief Is mani
fested, and already a movement has been
started to erect a fitting monument for
Mr. Gpebel's. memory on the spot In the
State house grounds where he was shot.
No. arrangements have as yet been
made for the funeral. Plunged In grief
and locked In the death chamber of their
brother. Arthur and Justus Goebel and
Mrs. Braunacker have given out no Inti
mation of their wishes and probably no
definite arrangements will be made until
to-morrow. It is understood that a re
quest will be made on behalf of the citi
zens of Frankfort that Mr. Goebel's last
resting place be in the Â¦ cemetery here,
where lie buried Daniel Boone and Vice
President Andrew Johnson. From an
early. hour this morning until. the hour of
his death Mr. Goebel's condition grew
steadily worse. Shortly before noon
after hypodermic injections of strychnine
and whisky and afterward of morphine
had been given htm, Mr. Goebel requested
that Captain L. G. â¢ Wallace of the Ken
tucky penitentiary, an intimate friend,
be sent for, and when, the latter came the
two:had.a short! conversation^.^-. -!_, .;
' "Lew," said Mr. Goebel; ."I wish to an
nounce to the world that I do- not hold
.myself in open violence to the word of
God."
'" The hypodermic injections afforded onÂ©
temporary relief. But the aufferer for the
first time In his long weary struggle for
life had apparently lost his indomitable
courage. "Doctor," said he feebly to Dr.
McCormack. who stood at the bedside,
"I'm afraid now that I'm not going to get
over this."
Dr. McCormack endeavored to cheer the
fast-failing man, but the latter soon re
lapsed into a condition of semi-conscious
ness. About 1 o'clock he aroused himself
again and calling Dr. McCormack to his
side said:
"Doctor, am I going to get well? I want
to know the truth, for I have several
things to attend to."
. "Mr., Goebel, you have but a few hours
to live," replied Dr. McCormack.
Mr. Goebel was silent for a moment,
then calling his brother, Arthur Goebel,
to his ?Ide he asked that the physicians
and nurses retire. Then for twenty min
utes the dying man was left with his
brother and sister, Mrs. Braunacker.
Soon after this he fell Into a stupor, and
at, 2 o'clock his condition was considered
so alarming that as a* last resort oxygen
was given in an endeavor to keep the
dying man alive if possible until the arri
val of his brother, Justus Goebel, from
Arizona, who was due shortly, after 6
o'clock. *'i.*
This' treatment resulted in an Improve
ment, but the rally was so slight and slow
that to the weary watchers' at the bed
side it was apparent that the end was not
far off, and Rev. Dr. Taliaferro of the
Methodist church of Frankfort was sent
for. .He came at once. Softly entering
the death chamber Dr. Tallaferro crossed" To Avoid Great Faults,

LIFE OF WILLIAM GOEBEL,
LAWYER AND STATESMAN
The death of William- Goebel, at the
hand of an assassin, removes from the
political sky of Kentucky one of the most
remarkable personalities that ever rose
above its horizon. He was born in Penn
sylvania, in JS6I. and moved with his pa
rents, when a child of 4 years of age, to*
Covington, Ky., where he ever since re
sided. He gained the substantial founda
tion of an education In the publics schools
of that city, and when yet in his .'teens
began to. study law in the office of ex-
Senator and ex-Governor John W. Steven
son. He .showed such remarkable genius
for the profession, and such ability in Its
practice, that on his admission to the bar,
though, still in his minority. Governor
Stevenson made him his partner/ This
partnership, with the strongest personal
friendship between the .'two, continued
until the death of the ex-Governor, who
made his young friend the executor of his
large estate without bond.
Soon after this he accepted an-invita
tion to a partnership with John G.,Car
lisle, the leading lawyer of the State, who
had become much impressed with the
legal ability displayed by the young man.
. This partnership . lasted a number 'of
years, and. was only terminated when the
gifted , senior member- was made .Secre
tary of the Treasury of the United
States. The departure of Mr. Carlisle to
Washington' left young Goebel with a
prestige that, backed by his own ability,
soon put him in the front rank. of the.le
gal fraternity in his section, and It was
not long before he had a practice of over
$25,000 per wear. He made, as it were, a
specialty of cases against -corporations.
Including railroads, and was so success
ful In this line that he found himself with
more work than he -could do.
Well established in his profession, he
turned, his attention to the political field
and met the same success as in his legal
career. After winning many or the lesser
honors. he was in the middle eighties
elected to the State Senate,: and soon be
came by name one of the best known men
in the State, due to the energy and zeal
with which he acted In behalf of a num
ber of measures concerning the : people ot
the State at large. '
One of these, the passage of the act
making gambling a felony, was. due^ al
most entirely to thÂ© work and will of Sen
ator Goebel. HÂ© also introduced and had
passed a bill fixing the rate of tolls over
Ohio River bridges at 1 cent for foot pas
sengers.' This led to a bitter hostility
tween him -and Colonel John Sandford, a
large stockholder In- one of the t bridge
companies, which ended In Goebel s
Bhooting Sandford, for which he was ac
quitted on trial, on a well-established
ground of. ! self-defense. Senator * Goebel
was the author among other measures of
the free , public library bill and a i strong
supporter of the McCloud railroad ; rate
bill, and the Chlnn school book bill to fur
nish 6chool books to pupils at" cost. His
championship bf the. "Goebel bill" In 18M
to repeal the charter obtained 'by â¢ tho
Southern Pacific Railroad from the Legis
lature of Kentucky in 1884 is yet fresh in
the minds of the readersof The-, Call, in
which fuil accounts of. thÂ© tight were
printed. at the time. , ?-

The prisoner whose release is demanded

making affidavit that he had,- been
prived of his liberty without due proce3s

that a writ of habeas corpus be Issued
against Governor Taylor and Adjutant
General Collier demanding the release of
Walker, and the writ was " placed in the
hands of Sheriff B. F. Sutler/ with direc
tions to s.erve immediately. _
Outside of the capltol grounds the Sher

marshal of the State troops guarding the
State building, and together the two
walked to" the entrance of the grounds
Sheriff Sutter explained the nature of his
mission to Captain Walcutt who at once
went to the executive building to notify
Governor Taylor and Adjutant General
Collier of the matter and learn their
wishes In regard to the matter. . Sheriff
Sutter In the meantime stood without
the gate close to the sentries, whose
crossed bayonets formed a. bar to his ac
cess. In a moment or two Captain Wal
cutt returned. In the meantime an im
mense crowd had gathered around -the
Sheriff without the gate In the apparent
expectation of trouble. No one waa al
lowed to enter the grounds, however, ex
cept a mall carrier with a sackful of let
ters, for whom the bayonets were un
crossed. When In a moment or two Cap
tain Walcutt returned he was also Im
mediately surrounded by a number of^tne
members of the State militia. Captain
Walcutt then informed the Sheriff that he
could not enter. The Sheriff again de
manded admittance and again was re
fused. Throughout the parley both men
were smiling and there was an utter ab
sence of ill feeling. â¢ . â¢
The Sheriff turned away and slowly
walked back to the Capitol Hotel, where
he found Judge Moore and reported his

DEEPLY REGRETTED
BY GOVERNOR TAYLOR
FRANKFORT, < Ky. , Feb. B.â Governor
Taylor while in his office in the executive
building received the news of Mr. Goebel'a
death. When offered the use of the .wires
of the Associated Press. to convey to ...the
people of the United States any statement
! Mr. Beckham was made acting Governor
last night by the medical certificate of
Dr. MrCormack that Mr. Goebel was un
able to 'assume the functions of the office.
Mr. Beckham seemed deeply affected by
the position in which circumstances had
placed him and he did not reveal much
joy over congratulations which those in
the room showered upon him, although he
accepted them gratefully.
"There is one thing that I would have
been greatly pleased to have done by Mr.
Goebel before his death," he said, "and
that is to have signed the certificate of
Senator Blackburn. Of course I am
greatly pleased to have the privilege my
self, but I know that it was a matter
close to th? heart of Mr. Goebel and I
wish that he could have lived longer. â¢ I
1 think I can promise." he said with a
smile, "that it will be one of the first
things that I will do on Monday."
At a later hour Mr. Beckham Issued a
proclamation to the people of Kentucky,
announcing that the work- of the assas
ein had ended in the death of Mr. Goebel
and he (Beckham) had qualified and aa>
pumed the dutie* of the chief executive.
After referring to the high character and
courage of the deceased, who is pro
nounced a martyr In the cause of the
people, the proclamation says:
I enter upon the discharge of the duties of
this hi trh office surrounded by ' conditions and
circumstances which would tax the wisdom of

BLOODSHED TO FOLLOW
THE LEGAL PROCESS
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Feb. 3.â Civil and
military authority in Kentucky have come
face to face at last and unless the minis
ters of one or the other recede from the
positions they occupy to-night, there can
be but one outcome and that is civil war.
Governor Taylor must, within forty
eight hours, surrender to the Circuit
Court of Franklin County the person of
Alonzo Walker, now held In custody by
him In the State executive building. Sher
iff Sutter of Franklin County, with a
a powerful posse at his back, will attempt
his release by force and it is hardly with
in the range of. possibilities that the at
tempt can be made without bloodshed or
loss of life.
If once blood is ehed in an armed con
flict in the streets of Frankfort, it is be
yond the wisdom of any man to tell how
far the flame of strife will spread.
Back in the mountain counties of
Laurel. Knox. Whltely. Pike and Clay
are thousands of mountaineers who bo
lleve that Governor Taylor has suffered
grievous wrongs at the hands of his politi
cal opponents and who are ready to lay
down their lives in his cause. In numer
ous other counties of the State are Demo
cratic partisans apparently more than
willing to shed their blood that the suc
cessor of William Goebel shall hold the
chair to which they believe the dead lead
er was legally elected.
Governor Taylor this afternoon refused
to acknowledge the existence or permit
the service of a writ of habeas corpus is
sued by Judge Moore of the County
Court. , He thus tacitly suspends the writ
of habeas corpus in the courts of Frank
lin County, something under the constitu
tion of the State of Kentucky which can
not be done legally, except in cases or re
bfllion or invasion.
, When Sheriff Sutter returned his writ
unserved to Judge Moore, the latter an
nounced that he would see that the
Sheriff was given power sufficient to en
force the mandate of his court. In so de
claring he used the following words:
. "No attempt will be made to enforce the
writ until Monday. At that time another
demand will be made for the body of
Alonzo Walker and if it is refused a suffi
cient, number of men will, be given to
Sheriff Sutter from Franklin County and
from adjoining counties ac well, to enable
him to take possession of the Capitol
grounds and carry out the purpose of the
writ."
The constitution of the State of Ken
tucky provides as follows:
nection 15. No power to eugpend laws shall
be exercised unless by the General Assembly
or its authority.
Section 16. AH persons shall be bailable by
sufficient security unless for capital offenses
when the proof is evident Or the presumption
treat, and the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended unless in case of
rebellion or invasion the public safety may re
quire it.
The Democratic leaders do not entirely
Indorse the attitude of Judge Moore, and
while they assert that his stand is right
and Just they do not- consider- It- at the
present time advisable. It is possible that
before the time set by Judge, Moore for
the service of the writ he may be induced
to alter his attitude. Unless he does this
or Governor Taylor acknowledges th* ser
vice of the writ and recognizes the exist
ence of the State courts, an armed con-

The children of Diggs by his first wife

the suit the children alleged fraud and
undue influence on the part of the plain
tiff in the procurement of the deed, and,
further, that at the time of making the
deed the grantor was of unsound mind.
Seven special issues were submitted to the
Jury and all were determined in favor of
defendants. The plaintiff therefore must

scribing his arrival at Durban . after es
caping from Pretoria, he continues:
Yesterday I rode out to watch the evening
bombardment which "we make on their en
trenchments with 4.7 guns. From the low hill on
which the battery is established the whole scene
is laid bare. The Boer lines run in a great cres
cent along the hills. Tier above tier of trenches
have been scored along their sides, and the
brown streaks run across the grass of the
open country south of the river. After tea in
the captain's tent. Commander Limpus of the
Terrible Invited me to look through the tele
scope and mark the fall of the shells. The
glass was one of great power and I could
plainly see the figures of the Boers walking
about In twos and threes, slttlnc on the em
bankments or shoveling away to heighten them.
We selected one particular group near, a kraal,
whose range had b<Â»en carefully noted,- anrt tne
great guns were brought to bear on the unsus
pecting tarcets. I looked through the spyhole
at the tiny pictureâ the dirty bÂ«ehiVes .for the
kraal, a long breastwork of newly thrown-up
earth six or seven miniature men gathered into
a little bunch, two others skylarking on the
grass beyond the trench, apparently engaged in
a boxing match. Then J turned to- the guns A
naval officer craned along the seventeen-root
barrel, peering through, the telescopic ...sights.
Another was pencrllnc some calculations as to
wind and llicht and other intricate details. The
crew stood attentively around. At last all was
done. I looked back to the enemy. The group
was still intact. The boxers were stljl playing
âone had jiushVd the other down. "A solitary
horseman iiad Rtt.o come into the picture and
was riding slowly across. The desire of mur
der arose In my heart. Now for a bag. Bang!
I jumped at least a Toot; disarranging the tele
scope, but there was plenty of time to reset It
while the shell was hissing and roaring its
way through nearly five miles of air. I found
the kraal atain: the group still th-re. but all
motionless and alert and like startled rabbits.
Then they beean to bob Into the earth, one
after the other. Suddenly in the middle of the
kraal there appeared a huge flash, a billowy
ball of smoke and clouds of dust. Bang! I
lumped asain. The second gun had fired. But
before this shell could reach the trenches a
dozen little figures scampered away, scattering
In all drrectlons. Evidently tne first had not
been without effect. But 1 turned the glass to
another rart of the defenses. The Boers were
walking away stolidly and only those near the
explosion showed any signs of disturbance.
The bombardment continued for half an hour,
the shells being flung somettmea into the
trenches, sometimes along the houses of Co
lenso and directed with marvelous accuracy.
At last the suns were covered up again In their
tarpaulins, the crowd of military spectators
broke up and dispersed amid the tents and soon
it became nisht. ' â¢

and shouted: -"Help, boys." His two nearest

the other twp belted. But then the English
came up In such numbers that we all lay down
as quiet as mite along the bank. They came
In single file, about SOO, along the footpath,
only about six yards from where we lay. Had
there been more of us, we would have con
tinued firing, but the English would simply
have trampled' us down.
We could, of course, see them well and over
hear all they eaid. One of them said, "Who
knows the way?" Another replied. "Keep to
the, right,",' and as I was sitting a few yards
to tt>e rlcht I felt somewhat uneasy, but they
Just then fortunately found the footpath again
and d!dÂ»not see me. While they were crossing
the ditch one of the English wounded cried
out, "Wounded man, wounded man to the
right; I can't walk." But one of them replied,
"Oh you are only a Dutchman," and another
cried. "Go to hell." When the English had
all passed the day was Just breaking. We
afterward found twenty-two of them killed and
wounded. Captain Paley was still living and
we did for him what we could, but wa had no

there were five or six of them â with a white

One Englishman had been struck by seven

was, I believe, not one who had less than two

only seven In number and only continued firing
for about five minutes you can see that it
must have been warm work. Besides ,the Brit

BECKHAM IS SWORN
IN AS GOVERNOR
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 3.â Exactly
one hour after the death of Mr. Goebel.
J. C. W. Beckham was sworn in as Gov
ernor of the State, the oath being admin
istered by S. J. Shackelford, clerk of the
Court of Appeals.
It had been determined to keep secret
the news of the death of Mr. Goebel until
Mr. Beckham should have been formally
Inducted into office and the delay was
raa.de greater by the inability of Dr. Mc-
Cormack to leave the bedroom of Mr.
Goebel and make the proper certificate of
death. Until this had been done the Dem
ocratic attorneys were unwilling that the
oath of office should be administered. Â¦
The ceremony took place in a small
room on the same floor a* that in which
Governor Goebel died and bait a few doors
to the west of it- In the room at the tima
ot the administration of the oath were
Senator-elect Blackburn, Colonel B. H.
Young. Colonel Philip Thompson, Eph
Lillard, J. H. Llllis. Lieutenant L. E. Mc-
Kay. S. J. Shackelford, clerk of the Court
of Appeals. Dr. P*. \V. Wells, Colonel Har
ry McKay, Colonel Jack Chirm, Kit
cfcinn. Dr. McCormack, Joseph Blackburn
Jr. and three representatives of the press.
Colonel Young, who was one of the lead-
Ing Democratic attorneys throughout the
Goebel-Taylor contest, and Senator-elect
Blackburn sat at a table in the center of
the room. upon which they had drawn up
the papers necessary to the administra
tion of office to Mr. Beckham. After the
papers had been completed there was a
wait of nearly ten minutes for Dr. Mc-
Cormack. The death certificate had al
ready been prepared and Dr. McCormack
quiciLly eigned Â»i;s name and swore to the
contents of the paper.
"Now, Mr. Beckham. It's your turn,"
Bald Colonel Young.
Mr. Becknann, who had been standing
In the far corner of the room, at once ad
vanced to the table with a flush of excite
ment on his youthful face.
"Sign the oath," 6aid Colonel Young,
pushing the paper toward him. Beckham
ZietUaied, and Colonel Young repeated his
request.
"Let me be sworn first," said Mr. Beck
bam.
"You must sign the paper before you
can take the oath." said Colonel Young.
"We want your oath to the signature."
.Mr. Beckbam advanced to the table and
affixed his signature and then stepped
back. He held up his right hand for the
oath, which was read to him by Clerk
fihackelford of the Court of Appeals. The
light was none of the best and the writ
ing? on the paper none of the most legible,
and Mr. Shackelford made slow work or
it- All of the time Mr. Beckham stood
before him with his eyes shining and a
deep flush on his face.
W hen the clerk read the concluding
words of the oatb. "so help you. God,"
Mr. Beckham's reply came:
"I do." and then with greater emphasis
"and may God give me strength to do my
duty."
"I devoutly hope he will." rejoined Col
onel Young.
Â¦ The first official action of Governor
Beckham was the appointment of a new
adjutant general and his last act before
assuming the oath was an order remov
ing Adjutant General Collier and Assist
ant Adjutant General Dickinson.
Â¦ The order was delivered to Captain Ben
nett at the gate of the Capitol grounds.

REPORT FALSE
Investigation of the "Chambers
of Tranquillity" Being
Conducted.
Yesterday the body of Tom Quong
Chong, the Chinese who died in the
chamber of tranquillity connected with
the undertaking establishment of Wing
Sun, at Sl9 Clay street, was examined by
Autopsy Physician Leland at the Morgue.
The result reveals the laxity of the death
certificate system, and also shows that
the city Is at present absolutely without a
correct or reliable record of the causes of
death In Chinese cases.
Malignant and contagious maladies may
have reaped harvests In the Mongolian
quarter, and many unfortunates may
have been the victims of poison, admin
istered either by enemies or, what is more
probable, while in the undertaker's bunks,
to which the footsteps all point in on*
direction; yet the deaths have been each
recorded as "natural cause" eases by a
physician whose investigation is post
mortem and stops with the statement of
a heathen undertaker, and whose com
pensation is a fee.
Dr. Leland said last night that there
was little doubt that the dead Chinese's
complaint was that of the kidneys and
heart, when he entered the "Chamber of
Silence" to die, and that the cause of
death could not have been "acute grastro
enteritis," as the death certificate issued
by Dr. Wilson shows. The stomach, from
observation, was not diseased, and the
only thing that Wilson had to base his
report on was the fact that the Chinese
undertaker had Informed him that Tom
Quong Chong had complained of pains In
his stomach.
Under police directions, the stomach
has been sent to the City Chemist's of
fice for analysis. It Is supposed that
lethal drugs are administered to the ill
when they have been disabled by disease
and given while alive into the keeping of
the undertaker.
It is impossibla for the autopsy physi
cian at present to state whether or not
death had been hastened in this case, as
he did not examine the stomach any fur
ther than to remove It and turn It over
to the chemist, who will probably make
an examination to-day or to-morrow.
Acting Chief Biggy will take decisive
measures to stop the barbarous practice
which was brought to his attention by
Police Officer Butler. He regards It as
disgraceful that such Inhuman treatment
has been permitted in a city like San
Frariciaco, and considers It strange that
it had not been stopped years ago. Should
poison be discovered In the stomach now
at the City Hall several arrests for mur
der may follow.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 3.â The printers, the press
men and the bookbinders in the State
Printing Office have gone out on a strike
and ur.til they receive from the Legisla
ture and the Governor substantial as
surance that their wages will be paid
them for work done and to be done cur
rent legislation will be hung up. There
are before both houses bills, amended
and otherwise, which have been ordered
to print. All of the contingent expense
bills carrying appropriations for the mile
age and per diem of the members and
the salaries of the clerks must again be
printed, and until some settlement is
made with the three unions represented
in the walk-out there will not be a cent
available to pay claims cf any sort.
It is one of these bills in process of
legislation upon which the present strike
hinges. Assembly bill 14 appropriated for
the use of the State Printing Ottice the
sum of JTSOO. It was passed through its
three readings and sent in to the Senate,
where it came up for consideration this
morning, and after some debate was re
turned to the Financa Committee with
the suggestion that the amount be re
duced to $50w. Tne reason given was'
that the original amount was excessive,
notwithstanding that a clause in the
measure provided that such funds as
should not be used should be returned to
the treasury.
The three unions were warned yester
day that there would be a fight on the
bill and wnen it came this morning they
were prepared for it. They had kicks of
several kinds to register and they did not
make them mildly. They called up the
fact that at the regular session Gage
\etoed the whole appropriation and said
they had been warned that he contem
plated similar action in the present case.
They also objected strongly to the
amount proposed, as they considered It
insufficient and they furtner objected to
doing clerical work and complained that
the copy sent to them by the clerks of
both houses was in such bad shape from
every standpoint that they were com
pelled to re-edit it and put it In shape
for the press. The legislators upon whom
they called, however, ignored their state
ments and ordered the bill re-referred.
A meeting of the three unions followed
Immediately with the result that this
afternoon the following correspondence
changed hands:

SENATE OPPOSED TO
THE JAMAICA TREATY
Sr-c'.aJ XJlfrateh to The Call.
CAT-L ..HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
JJEJfTO. Feb. 3. â The Senate this morning
.adopted a resolution urging the represen
tatives in Coiigress to oppose the proposed
treaty, with the British West Indies In
regard to the entry of citrus fruits into
<the .l"n!ted States. The resolution was In
troduced by Jones cf Orange and was
adopted unanimously. The treaty as it
row- .stands- in Congress proposes a reduc
tion of 20 per cent of the tariff. The citrus
fruit growers cf California. Senator Jone?
card, contend that the figure is too low
and would result In seriously crippling
the Industry.. It was ordered that the
resolution be telegraphed to Senator Per
kins and that printed copies be mailed to
the California representatives in Con
gress. The Senate passed the Assembly
bills appropriating J23.3X) for the per diem
of the members and for the contingent
expenses.
Laird introduced a resolution appropri
ating $2G for each of the members for
the contingent expenses. It was referred
to the Committee on Attaches, Mileage
and Contingent Expenses.
The bills providing for the appointment
cf a Commissioner of Public Works and
the creation of an auditing- board to the
Commissioner were passed without a dis
senting vote.
The San Francisco water front bill,
which provides for the transfer of money
in The depot sinking fund to the general
harbor improvement fund, was passed af
ter se%-eral attempts to amend failed.
The Senate took a recess to Monday

ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATION
BILLS NOT YET SIGNED
Social Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 3.-It looks as though the
existent lack of meal tickets is to be pro
longed Indefinitely. Dan Burns has folded i
his tent and, with the moneyed men of !
his camp, '-has went," leaving the faith
ful without his guarantee to back their
credit for bread, and from every indica- ;
tion it will be a week at least before even j
thpjr mileage warrants are drawn by the j
Controller. In accordance with the threat '
made in the Assembly yesterday by Dib- I
ble. Governor Gage has failed to sign the j
four appropriation bills providing for the I
contingent expenses of the House, and It
will take the better part of next week I
anyway, to muster enough votes to over
ride the veto which it is expected the ex
ecutlve will announce.
Nothing is known of Gage's reasons for i
failing to sign the necessary bills save
that he thinks the appropriations proposed !
are too heavy. As they stand now. they i
are figured on a thirty-day basi<= As I
originally presented by ValVntine of the I
i- inance Committee, to whom they were '
dictated by Gage, they were figured on a !
two weeks' basis, and an attempt to pass
them with that limit resulted In a hot j
fight, in which nearly every one on the I
fi ,? or P, artlc JPated on the side fighting for
the thirty-day figure.
Dibble and Valentine were almost the I
sole supporters of the Governor's sched
u e i V T1 2 e J es * of the Burns camp, head
ed by Johnson and Joined by nearly all
of the anti-Burns forces, insisted upon
amendments carrying tne thirty-day pro
vision. They finally won out and Dibble I
lof all factions. In the home of the dele
gation that led the onslaught on the rash
: programme of Dan Burns, destroying
every prospect of his becoming the junior
Californian United States Senator, there
!is great rejoicing. The Union League
Club reception that was held to-night be
i came a jollification. While it was not mi
i tended to celebrate the defeat of any Re
i publican, yet the rank and file breathed
\ easier when reflecting that a great ob
! Ftacle had been removed. Preparations
i are being made to tender Thomas R.
i Bard, whom every one looks upon as the
! next Unifd States Senator, a hearty ro
| crpiion when he shall return to Hueneme
! via Los Angeles. The presidents of the
: various Republican clubs have decided
I that this honor shall be awarded to the
I second Senator from Southern California.
[ It is also probable that the Chamber of
Commerce may tender Mr. Bard an infor-
I mal non-partisan reception.

Whereas, The articles of export enumerated In said pro

Whereas, The citrus product of this State, a nionn t intr to over

Whereas, At the reqnest of this body and the petition of the

to sacrifice the interests of a few for the benefit of a very large
majority; that the 'supposed benefit accruing to this country In
Its added proportion of the eight millions of dollars of trade
with Jamaica will not compensate It for the loss inflicted upon
one item alone of California production; that the California pro

would never receive the Governor's

A shout of disapproval went up at this

difference whether Dibble liked it or not
or whether the Governor did; if the bill
was not signed the veto would be over
ruled and the money demanded anyway,
although it would probably take a week
to do it. From this morning's session It
is evident that the Governor proposes to
find out for himself whether Johnson can
make his threat good. Routine work was
disposed of in short order. Senate bill 10,

PARIS, Feb. 3.â Paris, which is normal
ly In the throes of party strife, is hardly
recognizable thi3 week, so devoid has it
been of political excitement. . This mo
mentary absence of Internal conflict hua
given the press and political world a
chance to concentrate attention upon the
European situation evolved from the cri
sis which the British empire is now trav
ersing. Diplomats are discussing nothing
but the clouds which # are hanging over
Great Britain's horizon*. Beneath the in
subordination of Egyptian troops in Khar

discerned the intriguing hand of an en
emy of England.
Unusual activity among the embassies
here is manifested and there are signs of
a highly strung condition of the nerves
of every European chancellerle. The sus
picious movements of Russia on the Per
sian and Afghan frontiers and. her dis
patch over sea of important reinforce
ments of men and material to- the -Chinese
country, which continued this week, is
interpreted as an. evil omen to the world*
peace.
It can be said almost certainly that no
surprise ; would b< occasioned .In diplo
matic circles if the near future saw some
act of aggression <m the part of Russia
toward the fulfilment of her dream of
reaching the open sea, probably through
Persia. It i 3 universally recognized that
Russia never had a better moment than
the present, when she has the sympathy
of France and when the hands of her
only redoubtable opponentâ Englandâ are
tied to South Africa. : .- .
The Paris press sees this reputed Rus
sian design and does not conceal its
hearty approbation, not. an incoTis.iderab!e
portion of the press even urging the
Government to join hand* with Russia,
despite the fact that it would mean ruin

NEW GOLF STICK.
May Render the Caddy a Thing of
the Past.
Special Dispatch to The Call
PASADENA. Feb. 3.â Franc L. Grannls
of this city, a wealthy devotee of the
game of golf. Is preparing for patent a
new kind of golf club, which he thinks
and Is confident will not only double his
fortune but will revolutionize the royal
game of golf. The caddie will be extinct In
a few years if this invention proves to be
a success. V,'e have the chalnless bicycle,
the horseless carriage, smokeless powder,
etc â¢ and Mr. Grannis Insists that the cad
dlless golfer should now fall In line. The
only use a caddy can be put to when he
Isn't chasing balls Is carrying golf clubs.
So Mr. Grannls has invented and applied
for a patent for a golf club which will re
duce to a minimum of one the number of
sticks which It Is necessary for the scien
tific goltlte to have In his company.
The club is In reality a patent cleak.
which is supplied with a mechanism that
quickly transforms It Into any of the
sticks commpnly usedâ the lofter. the put
ter, the ml/iron and even the driver. It
may be made either left-handed or right
handed and changed to suit the condition
of the player. The desired effect is se
cured by a screw and pivot arrangement
that can be easily operated, sliding the
heel of the club upward or downward and
adjusting it. to the proper angle. Mr.
Grannls says that the weight of the mech
anism Is not sufficient to Interfere with It.

Preliminary Steps Taken to Form a

At the session of the Supreme Grove of
the Ancient Order of Druids held in IS9B
authority was granted to the jurisdiction
of the State of California to organize a
grand circle of the order, which is the
ladies' branch of the organization. In
pursuance. of this authority, Grand Noble
Arch James F. Martinonl some time since
issued an order to the several circles of

to be held for the purpose of taking the
necessary steps to proceed to the organi

PERSONALITIES
AT THE ALCAZAR
Â«jj=SNEACEFUL, Valley" has a value, an
L^intercst, a humor of its own. The
jÂ£ play is simple and homely, and of
ample merit to please any one of
normal appetite. There is no pretense to
literate elegance, but there is good hu
man stuff in the thing, and in one part at
least an opportunity for acting.
A character part Is the best thing that
can happen to Ernest Hastings, for when
he is given, a fair chance to get away
from himself the art that is In him ap
pears. To see him as Hosea Howe is a
gratification. He really makes an effort
to carry out the character, and it is in
teresting to see with what ease he accom
plishes a bit ol downright good work.
Hastings is not an enthusiastic profes
sional; he strikes one as a particularly
easy-going, lazy sort of person, and when
in his lackadaisical way he cleverly hits
off a character he is to be credited with
a ready dramatic facultyâ the gift of na
ture rather than the product of hard
work.
Hastings is simple and stralghtforwarfl
as the loutisn "Hosle," and the little
touches with which he helps the part to
its importance are applied with a senso
of fitness and quite a delicate understand
ing of comedy values. Aa the re6ult is
agreeable it matters little whether nature
or Bkill has the more to do with it and
we should be satisfied if our actor keep
us chuckling, and he does.
There are no guffaws that go v/Ith
"Peaceful Valley." but there is a quiet
6ort of fun sustained throughout the play
that may be readily relished. y
Miss Blayney is not an accomplished
actress, but I like her better than Rome
or more ability and less refinement. She
is more gentle of voice and manner than
any actress I can immediately recall, and
her natural conversational tone, her pret
ty emphasis and gracious well-bred airs
with their touch of inoffensive coquetry
quite takes one away from the stage and
makes one feel that one is in the presence
of a lady. It is not dramatic art, but per
sonal charm and its influence, with no
other Influence than simple and natural
acting, docs not often make itself
felt across the footlights. I am assuming
that Miss Blayney's rare quality of tas
cination is appreciated by every one. If
It is not. my standards and those oÂ£ the
public differ. PORTER GARNETT

BOOK DEALERS TO
FIGHT STUDENTS
Object to the Co-Opera
tive Stores.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 3.â The book dealers
of this city have combined to fight the
co-operative bookstore recently estab
lished by the students of the Normal
School. San Francisco book men will be
asked to co-operate in the campaign with
a view to extending the war into all
schools and colleges of the State where
co-operative stores are maintained."- Just
along what lines this fight is to be con
.ducted is a secret, but undoubtedly an
effort will be made to get the wholesalers
and book ring to refuse to deal with
students.
A couple of weeks ago the trustees of
the Normal School granted the students
permission to open a co-operative book
store. This was immediately done and
the students are now buying their books
at wholesale prices. This - has i been Â¦Â¦&'â¢
severe blow to local dealers, who here
tofore enjoyed the patronage of the 700
students of the institution.- This trade
amounted to many, .thousands of dollars
a year.
The local dealers have now organized
and cut their prices on Normal books
below wholesale rates in the hope of
breaking up the co-operative store. A
circular setting forth the prices has been
sent to each dealer.
The Board of Trustees of the school
will be asked to forbid the students from
maintaining a co-operative store on the
premises on the ground that it deprives
dealers of a legitimate trade.
The dealers have appointed a commit
tee of three to confer with San Fran
cisco book dealers and ask them to take
up arms and fight this "evil," which
threatens to spread to the public schools.
The wholesalers will be expected to help
in the matter. Dealers declare that un
less the thing is checked it will be only
a short time before the pupils of the pub
lic schools will be buying their goods
throug-h the co-operative plan.
Stanford University also maintains a
co-operative bookstore. / If a State move
ment can be inaugurated the dealers pro
pose fighting the co-operative stores at
all schools and colleges. It Is understood
her^ that the Stanford store buys direct
from Eastern wholesalers and that Cali
fornia dealers, if there is any chance to
win. will readily take up the fight started
by local dealers. -.r:r '
CIVIL SERVICE
RULE CHANGED
Ex-Soldiers Get Former
Positions.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. B.â The President
has amended civil service mlÂ© 11 by add
ing to section 4 the proviso: "And. pro
vided further, that nothing contained in
this rule, or in any regulation made In
pursuance thereof, shall be construed so
as to prevent an appointing officer in his
discretion from promoting a person who
served in the military or naval service cf
the United States in the late war of the
rebellion or In the Spanish- American war
and who was honorably discharged there
from, who has been reinstated in the ser
vice to a grade or position below that
from which he was separated to a grad*
Or position nq higher than that from
which he was separated."
The particular case which : brought
about this amendment was that of a JIiVH)
clerk who enlisted in the army during the
war with Spain and upon his discharge
asked for. reinstatement under the rul3
which permits the reinstatement 'of.-sol
diers without limitation as to time he was
separated from the service. It happened
that the 'only vacancy' in his particular,
branch of the service at the time be made
application was that of assistant :m?a
senger at $720 per. annum. Being in great
need, the soldier accepted this place on
the promise that he should receive nro-.
motion to a higher grade as soon as a va
cancy occurred. In the following 1 week hÂ«
was selected for promotion, and the Civil
Service Commission- was not informed of
the fact, w-hen it transpired that under

MANSLAUGHTER IS CHARGED.
John McCarthy Accused of the Death
of Francois Bachow.
In the matter of the inquest on the body
of Francois Rachow yesterday the Coro
ner's Jury returned a verdict to the effect
that death was caused by tetanus and
cerebral congestion due to injuries in
flicted by a stone in the hands of John
McCarthy, and charged McCarthy with,
manslaughter.
Rachow died In the French Hospital on
January 28, after having had a quarrel
with McCarthy in front of Carrerre's sa
loon on Fifth avenue. South San Fran
cisco, and it is alleged that McCarthy
beat Rachow on the head with' a stone.
The deceased was a native of France,
aged 85 years, and had been employed as
a tripehand at 1332 Fifth avenue, South
San Francisco. .
MOHAN WANTS DAMAGES.
Sues Captain and Master at Arms of
the Thomas.
Daniel Moran of 249 Stevenson street,
father, of Dan Moran, alias James Pol
lard, was appointed by United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven yesterday guardian
ad litem of his son, and filed a suit
against Captain John F. Schiller and Mas
ter at Arms William Holmes of the Gov
ernment transport Thomas, demanding
$10,000 damages.
The complaint alleges that young Mo
ran, who was a coalpasser on the
Thomas, was knocked down with a black
jack by Master at Arms Holmes, placed
in irons by order of Captain Schiller and
conilned in a damp, chilly hole, in which
to his great anguish he was obliged to
lunch on bread and water to keep hlm
eelf from starvation.
Captain Schiller, It Is said, will appear
with witnesses before the Federal Grand
Jury en Tuesday to ask for young Mo
ran's indictment on the charge of mutiny
if Judge de Haven should decide in the
meantime that the Federal courts have
Jurisdiction over offenses committed on a
Government vessel. If the decision should
be the other way the captain will have
young Moran court-martialed, in which
event the coalpasser- may get several
years' residence in a military prison.
MOET and CHANDON
CHAMPAGNE
Absolute Facts That Cannot Be Oispufed:
FIRST The house of MOET and GHANDON was
.founded in 174?- ' :;:^ : ' ;i Â£i^Â£i'
SECOND. The house of MOET and CHANDON
owns more vineyards than all of the other houses
combined.
THIRD. The sales of MOET and CHANDON
throughout the world greatly exceed those of any
other brand . .
FOURTH. The wine shipped to the United States at
the present time by the house of MOET and
CHANDON is of the celebrated vintage of 1893, of
which they hold a sufficient reserve to insure its
continuance for a considerable period.
FIFTH. MOET and CHANDON Champagne has been
served exclusively for a great many years at
most of the prominent society functions. Â¦ :
SIXTH. After' repeated sampling and careful compari-
son with all the other Champagnes by the ablest
experts, MOET and CHANDON has been pro-
nounced, without question, far superior in quality
to any of the other brands. âNew York Herald.

With the Boers.
BITTER COMMENT AROUSED
UNITED STATES ACCUSED OF
INGRATITUDE.
Cunningham -Graham Deplores the
Fact That England Lost Spain's
Friendship During the
Late War.
Copyrighted, isoo, by the Associated Presa.
LONDON, Feb. S.â Mr. Cunningham-
Graham, a former member of Parliament,
Inquires in an open letter what Great
Britain has gained "by all our squirmings
and grovelings before the United States,"
as he defines Great Britain's good will,
and he thus answers:
"An open door. Yes. And a booted foot
to kick us through It. It was ever the
sneak's reward to be thus treated."
He assumes that the sympathy of the
United States is with the Boers; that
Great Britain has not only not the sym
pathy, but has almost failed to receive
the neutrality of the United States; and
that is Great Britain's reward for having
thrown over Spain, her ancient ally, and
come magnanimously to the assistance
of the United States.
The Standard, among its death notices
to-day, prints the following:
McLACHLANâ On Christmas day, shot in Mar
ket square, Harrismlth, Orange Free State,
South Africa, for refusins to fljrht against his
own countrymen, John McLachlan Jr.. aged
30, eldest son of John McLachlan of Wands
worth, and grandson of the late John Mc-
I-achlan of I-a.n-.bol.
The Spectator says that if the state
ment contained In the notice Is true the
whole English-speaking world should ring
with denunciations of a crime so detest
able.
"Especially," it adds, "should Ameri
cans speak out on such a matter, for they
showed the true way in their treatment
of technical rebels and set an example
to mankind."
The story that Mrs. Joubert Is with
General Joubert at the front and per
sonally providing for his table does not
surprise those who know something of
that energetic woman. She went with
him often in his campaigns against the
natives. The old times in the laager,
when, with other women, she melted lead
for bullets for the men, have been re
called by Amsterdam acquaintances, who,
taking her through the big Rijka Mu
seum, pointed out an ancient pewter col
lection. Her only remark was:
"Good to make bullets of."
A dispatch has been received from Lady
Randolph Churchill, who is on board the
American hospital ship Maine at Dur
ban, saying the vessel will be stationed
there for the present. The Maine was
tilling with wounded men, including num
bers from the battle of Spion Kop.
A telegram to the Morning Post says:
"The \.aine is of inestimable service to
the authorities and a merciful blessing
to the wounded, who after lying all night
long on the battlefield and weary of jolt
ing in railways at last find peace."
To say that the nation stood appalled
at the tone and substance of the earlier
speeches of the official leaders of both
parties in Parliament does not go
beyond the truth. Since then, how
ever, has come relief from most
unexpected quarters. The situation has
been distinctly cleared and the coun
try has now grounds to hope that the
Cabinet means to act. not talk, and Is
thinking of the;woik ahead rather than
of self-exultation. Thanks first to George
Wyndham, Under Secretary of State for
the. War Office, then to George J. Gos
chen. First Lord of the Admiralty, much
of the gloom has been dispelled and the
nation is able to feel more comfortable on
an essential point., that the deficiencies of
organization have been fully recognized
and that the Government is determined
to remedy them. There is small wonder
the country Is asking why. if a subordi
nate member of the' Government, like
Wyndham, and Goschen, who, though
formerly an Impassioned orator, of recent
years has lost much of his forcefulness,
are able to produce this tranquilizlng ef
fect, statesmen of more conspicuous posi
tion have failed to adopt the same tone
of candor and good feeling. Lord Salis
bury and Balfour distinctly prejudiced
the Cabinet and Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman and James Brlce seriously
damaged the Liberals by their apparent
indifference to the most manifest currents
of public sentiment.
Wyndham and Goschen, however,
proved themselves in touch with national
opinion and as Goschen proceeded almost
directly from a Cabinet meeting to tho
House of Commons, the country believes
it is entitled to accept the resolute tones
in which he spoke as a token that the
Ministers at length appreciate aright the
situation ac it affects the Government
and the country. I
Wyndham's speech immensely enhanced
his parliamentary reputation and his
chances for attaining full ministerial
rank. He has been a soldier and a Jour
nalist and railroad director, fairly rich,
connected by relationship and otherwise
with the best families in the country.
With political training of a high order,
Wyndham will most likely be among the
men leading Great Britain In the twen.
tieth century.
Goschen also arose to the occasion. He
displayed some of his old-time fire and
roused the hearers to strong excitement,
notably when he charged Brice, who de
clared the war was unjust and unneces
sary, with giving "a brief to every enemy
of England."
The whole tone of Goschen's measured
language was reassuring and showed the
admiralty is keeping a good lookout
ahead. There vas no mistaking the sig
nificance of his intimation that the ad
miralty has been assiduously, yet undem
onstratively, engaged In perfecting naval
arrangements to meet all contingencies.
Goschen Indulged In the usual reserva
tions and qualifications, but the country
reads between the lines a. recognition of
possible international dangers, and is im-.
mensely relieved at Goschen's assurances
that the country thus far has only put
out Its left arm, and that its right arm,
with all the muscles hardened, is held In
reserve for possible interference In the
war or an attempt to rob Great Britain
of the fruits of victory.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1900.
GERMANS EAGER
TO HONOR LEYDS
Transvaal Agent Still a
Popular Idol.
CONFERS WITH YON BULOW
SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION
KEPT SECRET.
Berlin Officials Foresee Grave Possi
bilities in the Mutiny Among
the Egyptian Troops at
Khartoum.
Copyrighted, ISOO, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Feb. 3.â Dr. Leyds, diplomatic
agent of the Transvaal, continues to be
the sensation here. The officers of the
British embassy are amazed at the
warmth of his reception and the intepse
interest taken in the war. Dr. Leyds, the
correspondent is reliably Informed, had
another long conference with Count yon
Bulow, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
yesterday at the Foreign Office. Dr. Leyds
refused to make any statement on the
subject. ',
It is said that the Transvaal special
commercial representative, Deward, who
is now in Holland, has been summoned to
Berlin, where he will give authentic in
formation about a number of commercial
details touching upon Transvaal imports
and exports. From a good source it <s
learned that a number of leading German
industries in machinery Â¦ and other
branches met at the Foreign Office during
the week and received inside information
about this subject. The German Govern
ment believes that, no matter which way
the war is finally decided, there will' be a
splendid field for German exports to '.he
Boers, and steps accordingly were taken.
The German press comment during the
week was much more moderate. There
was a remarkable editorial to-day In the
Vorwaerts headed "England at the Turn
of the Road," saying England's prestige
thus far has not suffered by the war de
feats, but the paper advises England's In
boring population to insist on the rapid
conclusion of peace, as their interests
above all would Buffer by a longer war.
The Magdeburg: Zeitune publishes a let
ter from Commandant Albrecht, t!ie
Orange Free State artillery chief, dat>?d
Kronstaadt, December 17. He says Presi
dent Kruger is an unimpeachable charac
ter and the grandest of patriots. The
commandant says:
"The artillery hitherto has proved of lit
tle avail on both sides in spite- of the fact
that the Boer guns are. better than those
of the English and that the Boers' aim is
better than the English aim. The battles
of Magersfontein and Colenso were de
cided by the rifle, and not by the guns."
General Albrecht ridicules the lyddite
bombs, which, he says, caused no dam
age. He concludes with saying that,
Judging from the war, the losses through
the modern weapons are no greater than
before, but rather smaller.
The news from Egypt of mutiny among
the Egyptian troops at Khartoum is re
garded here gravely, especially as pri
vate dispatches confirm the reports pre
viously received. In circles close to the
Government it is considered that a spread
of mutiny and an uprising like Arbi Bey's
is within the possibilities. Here it is also
believed that in such a case France would
be sure to actively intermeddle, probably
backed up by Russia.
An article by Sir Edward J. Reed, chief
constructor of the navy, on the Emperor
in the Deutsche Revue is creating a pleas
ant sensation, the article being extremely
appreciative and sympathetic. Instancing
a number of points from the writer's per
sonal observation as showing the Empe
ror's remarkably close and accurate in
formation about naval and other difficult
matters and hia freedom from prejudice.
The United States Embassy is gratiflftl
at the fact that for months there has
been a perfect lull in the complaints aboit
German official seizures and vexatious de
lays of American meats and fruit. Ex
cepting a few trifling cases, nothing has
been heard of that description, and the
embassy has not been requested for
months" to furnish assistance.
Sidney Odanne. an expelled captain of
the German army, once military instruc
tor of the Emperor and later convicted of
high treason, is now charged here with
having defrauded a number of employe.?.
While in Paris on business thr French
authorities expelled him. Odanne. on
hearing of the charges to-day, returned
here of his own accord to refute them.
Among the Americans married to promi
nent Germans who are now here for the
season's gayeties are Countess yon
Goetze and Baroness yon Schutzbar, nee
Marston of Chicago: Baroness yon Luett
wltz of New York. Countess yon Mul yon
Matuschka, formerly of Detroit: Baroness
yon Clskra, "nee King, of New York,
of the new sfcretarv of the Austrian Em
bassy, and Frau Nimpitsch. formerly of
New York. Mrs. Harp, a niece or Gen
eral Grant, is here for the winter.
Herr Friedlander, a financier, pave a
luncheon today at the Hotel â¢ Bristol to
Dr. Leyds. Mr. White. United States Em
bassador, was invited, but declined, plead
ing a mass of official work.

STORIES OF BRIBERY
Two Men Testify That They
Were Paid for Having Sworn
to False Affidavits.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
Cave almost the entire day to hearing the
testimony of Ben Hill and L. L. Wright
In Us investigation of the charges against
Senator Clark of Montana. Theee wit
nesses wen called by the defense, al
though they had come to Washington at
the. instance of the memorialists.
Both testified that they had bean en
raffed to make affidavits . against Clark;
that they were paid for them, and that
the affidavits were false. Both had been
In Helena during the sitting of the Legis
lature as Clark's friends and both said
their expenses had been paid there. Hill
claimed that Campbell and Whiteside had
assisted him in dictating his affidavit and
that they knew the statements contained
in It to b* false. These two witnesses
agreeo. In a statement that several wit
nesses. Including themselves, had agreed,
after giving their affidavits, not to teeti
fy :n the Wellcome disbarment case until
they should get morÂ« moneyâ slooo
apieceâ but Hill eaid that Campbell had
told him that hÂ« would not dare pay him
before he went upon the stand, because
of the use Clark would make of the fact
If he should become acquainted with it.
Campbell made a statement contradicting
the assertion made by Hill and also the
statements made by Lyons yesterday.
Wright. who is a watchmaker of Mis
ftoula. was the first witness to-day. He had
been summoned by the representatives of
the prosecution, but they declined to put
him on the stand, and he was called by
the defense. It became apparent at the
beginning that he had been called to im
peach the testimony of the witness Rec
tor concerning the alleged efforts to bribe
Representative Jaqueth. Rector had tes
tified that Wright was present when the
money was paid, but Wright denied this.
The witness testified to having agreed
to give an affidavit and to testify in the
Wellcome disbarment trial at the instance
of Ben Hill and Mr. Little, the latter the
secretary of Congressman Campbell. He
'taii be was to receive $150 for the affi
davit ar.d $1000 for his verbal testimony,
to be taken later. He d!d sign and swear
to an affidavit, receiving $200 for this serv
ice.
The affidavit waa read by Senator
Faulkner, and was full of accusations
against members of the Legislature. Â° no
ot which was to the effect that A. J.
tteeie a friend of Senator Clark, had
given an envelope containing SltJ.tWO, to be
â¢ Â¦:ven to Senator Myers for his vote for
Â« lark but that Steele had later come to
him and requested the return of the mon
ey. Baying -Myers preferred that \\ nite
r: :Â¦Â¦ stlOUld hold it.
â¢â¢Now Mr. Wright, is that affidavit true
or false?" asked Faulkner.
â¢It is faise. and they knew it was false
at the time it was made." replied the wit
ness' "I did it for what there was in it.
It was got up to help purify politics. '
"It is the statement you swore to?' sug
c-sted Turley. and the witness assented.
He said he had not intended to make the
same statement he had made in his affi
davit if he had gone on the stand, but he
had refused to testify because the tliw
had not been paid. He testilied further
that he went to Helena to testify in the
Wellcome disbarment case, but that he
and three other witnesses had an agree
ment not to speak until the money waa
paid The prosecution had refused to pay
him 'until after he went on the stand,
"that $1000 in my hands with my
Ftaternent would be worth 529.0U0 to
One of the men in the combination had
broken the agreement and the witness
eaid he had seen Ben Hill offer him $jXÂ».
which, however. Hill had asked to be al
Â°The witness 'said he had received $120
from Datv's friends at Helena, and that
just before starting to Washington he had
received $200 more and $S0 more since his
ai SfricV Hill and himself had been in
Washington they had received an offer of
$2500 from Dr. Minshall on behalf of the
prosecution to get out of the city.
On cross-examination witness said he
had gone to Helena during the sitting of
the; Legislature to work for Clark for
Senator but he had done most of his work
in the "third house." He had received
J243 from Steele for this service.
"Did you not tell me after your arrival
In Washington that you had held $10,000
for Senator Myers?" asked Birney.
"I think probably I did."
"Don't you know you did"
"No. I "don't know: I don't recollect. I
Intended you to understand that I had.
because I wanted to get our business
fixed up."
In reply to another question the wit
ness said that Ben Hill was the only per-
Bonwbo had promised to give him money
When Wright was excused Ben Hill,
also of Missoula, was called. He had
been excluded from the committee room
while Wright, was testifying, because the
two men had been associated in all their
efforts in connection with the Senatorial
race and since the adjournment of the
Legislature. He said on his direct exam
ination that he had been connected with
Congressman Campbell and Mark Hewitt
In working up the case aplr.st Clark for
the paÂ«t eight months. He had just been
down to Bridger. he said, for Clark, for
which he had received $350 from that gen
tleman, when he met Whiteside on the
tircet in Butte and told him "a lot of
dâ d lies." After that he had gone to
Campbell's office and signed 'about 1.00
IÂ»ap*s of stuff In which there was not a
word of truth." This affidavit had been
dictated and written by him. The affida
vit was then read. In it the witness said
that he had entered into a combination
to aÂ«Â«iÂ«t in the election of Clark, and that
he had committed many acts looking to
the bribery of members of the Legisla
ture to vote for Clark for the United
States Senate. Â¦
In response to a question Hill said the
affidavit was false
-When Campbell and Whiteside would
see him talking to a man they would ask
me what the talk was about and I. would
tell them according to what money I
got."
"Did you get more than 5250 for your
work?" was asked.
"Yes, I got several such sums.
The witness stated that in conversations
with Campbell after the affidavit was pre
pared many alterations' were made in the
document and that he had subsequently
given the altered document to Campbell.
Campbell was asked to produce this al
tered document, and said he would try to
find it
After Faulkner had resumed the investi
gation Hoar interrupted him. asking him
to curtail the Inquiry, saying that after
the witness" own admissions no statement
that he could make would be of value to
Hill testified to having paid $3W for affi
davits in Missoula. drawing drafts on
Campbell for the money. Campbell said
he had honored the drafts, and would
explain why when he should take the
stand.
Concerning witnesses called to Helena
to testify in the disbarment trial. Hill
tail there had been an understanding that
only Dr. Minshall should go until $1000
was paid to each of them. Whiteside had
priven the money to a man named Harrity
for him. and the latter had handed him
$510 of this amount, which the witness
said he still had In his possession, having
kept It In order to make the prosecution
pay the remaining amount, which he said
ream promised. He told the messenger who
had brought him a message asking him
to go to the State Supreme Court to tes
tify to "tell the Supreme Court to go to
h â â¢" rnmaafa^ifiTrvÃiHr" i *hiw "mnrr m %
At the afternoon session of the commit-
tee Hill continued his testimony concern
ing the dealings of himself, Wright,
Minshall and Cowen with Congressmen
Campbell and Whiteside. He said they
had paid them various sums of money at
different times. Hill said he had told
Campbell at that time that Cowen's affi
davit was false. Among others who had
given him money, the witness* said, was
Tuohy 'of Butte. That gentleman had
given him $250 and had also given
money to others of his combination.
Hill said that from his conversation with
Campbell and Whiteside he was satisfied
Marcus Daly was putting up the money
for the prosecution. Whitesido had said:
â¢â¢We have no specific amount, but Mar
cus never limits us."
Hill said .that Rector, one of the wit
nesses for the prosecution, had told him
that he was to have $500 for coming to
Washington, and that Rector â¢ had also
told him that his testimony was not true.
When. Hill retired Congressman Camp
bell requested that he be sworn, saying
that If the committee considered Lyons',
Hill's and Wright's statements true he
was unfit to proceed as counsel in the
case. He thought he should have an op
portunity to explain. The committee al-
lowed him to explain, as counsel, but did
not require him to be sworn.
Campbell first took up the statement of
Thomas E. Lyons, and said the lattcr's
statement that he (Campbell) had offered
him money to commit porjury was abso
lutely untrue. He admitted that he had
talked with Lyons and that he had given
him $300 to pay the expenses of the inves
tigation that Lyons was to make. With
reference to Hill's affidavit, he denied
having dictated it. saying that Hill had
spent an entire day with his (Campbell's)
typewriter in a. back, room dictating the
statement, and that he (Campbell) had
not been in the room a half-hour, during
the day. He admitted paying drafts for
$300 made upon himself by his private sec
retary to pay for affidavits by Wright
and Minshall. but said that at the same
time he had- told him that the testimony
of the men could not be Used.
Campbell said he had employed Hill to
get at the truth of a rumor that an effort
was being made to have Whiteside impris
oned through one Folk; that he had es
pecially desired to have a letter intercept
ed and that Hill had opened It. It was
not true that he had paid Hill any money
to do anything that was "crooked."- nor
that Hill had told him his affidavit was
untrue. , . . . .
-Other witnesses of the day were Barney
Shanahan of Butte and John Burns. of
Helena, who were put on by the defense
to contradict the statement of Stato Rep
resentative Normoyle to the effect that
they had approached him with the sugges
tion that he could get 510.000 for a vote for
Clark for the Senate.' The two witnesses
agreed that Normoyle had made advances
to them, indicating that he would like to
get money for his vote. â¢

MUCH RESENTMENT AT
BURLINGTON'S ACTION
Union Pacific Objects to the New
Through Train" Between. Chicago
and San Francisco. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Feb. 3.â The action of the
Burlington in putting on a through train
from. Chicago to San Francisco via Den
ver and the Rio Grande Western into
Salt Lake and Ogden has caused some
resentment at the Union Pacific head
quarters, and that road, it is said, will
try to checkmate the new deal. Such
action it is understood, will involve the
closing of the Ogden gateway, for the
reason that the Union Pacific has about
concluded it should haul all the freight
from the Missouri River to points west
of Â» Ogden, since ; no- plausible reasons
exist why it should help swell the freight
receipts of the Rio Grande Western and
its connections. '^PNSsMsASBsBVBMHVSfI
This feeling has been strengthened re-
cently by reason of certain hostile
actions directed toward the Union Pacific
by the Rio Grande Western.
In Omaha considerable interest is mani
fested in this projected meeting for the
reason that it is believed matters of un
doubted importance to this city may
come up for consideration. It is still
maintained in reliable quarters here that
certain departments of the Oregon Short
L-ine are to be removed from Salt Lake
to Omaha, notably the auditing depart
ment. ,

piece of dramatic art which has at once,
the severe restraint of Sophoclean trag

The Dally Chronicle calls the play a
"live poem and a live drama, a thing of
exquisite poetic form, yet tingling from
first to last with intense dramatic life.
He has chosen a theme of pure passion
and has steeped it In an atmosphere of
purÂ© poetry-" The critic continues:
"I am easily reconciled to saying no
word which shall appear to qualify my
estimate of 'Paolo and Francesca,' as a
thing unique In our day, a new and in
timate blending of poetic sweetness with
dramatic strength. At the lowest and
least, it stands far as the poles apart
from the ordinary blank-verse play of
theatrical commerce. It Is brief, poignant,
rapid, vital, never lingering for a mo
ment over empty rhetoric; and its verse
has a delicate music of its own which will
require almost a new art for its adequate
rendering."
Sydney Colvin. writing !n the Nineteenth
Century, devotes a long article to the
play. He says:
"To my mind the result, as it now lies

and power, free from the shortcomings of
the author's previous work, and testify
ing to his possession of quite unsuspected
gifts. To the rich poetical .production of

that Mr. Phillips has added that which
was hitherto lacking, notwithstanding so
many attempts made by famous men:
namely, a poetical play of the highest
quality, strictly designed for and express
ly suited to the stage."
The Westminster Gazette remarks that
this is "high testimony from a sound

adds:

IRON FOR THE PACIFIC COAST.
PACIFIC COAST interests are given such little
attention in the East that it is something of a
rarity to find anything like a fair notice of
them in the press of that section. It is therefore
gratifying to observe that the New York Tribune, in
commenting recently upon the coal and iron mines
in Southwestern Utah, gives a satisfactory survey of
the prospects which the development of the -mines
will in all probability realize for California and for
the coast.
It is pointed out that while the iron ore of the
district is not so free from phosphorus as that of
the vicinity of Lake Superior, the percentage is
nevertheless small. Coal which can be made into
a good quality of coke, and the limestone needed for
reducing the ores, are near at hand. It is added that
a large tract of the iron district has been leased to a
corporation, with the stipulation that not less than
150,000 tons shall be taken out yearly, and the fur
ther announcement is made that a British syndicate
having large financial backing has also obtained a
footing in the region and contemplates the construc
tion of a railway to the Pacific Coast.
Taking those facts as a basis the Tribune says:
"The construction and. operation of hundreds of fac
tories on or near the coast will certainly follow the
successful production of. iron in Utah. It must not
be forgotten that Montana and Arizona, which al
ready furnish more copper than Michigan, are nearer
to the Pacific seaboard than to the Atlantic, and if
the former be furnished with cheap iron also, im
mense manufacturing results may be expected.
Within half a century the manufacturers of this coun
try â practically all of them here in the East â have
won three distinct victories. First, they almost com
pletely excluded from the domestic market the Euro
pean producer. Next, they successfully invaded
countries whose trade Europe once monopolized â
Egypt, China and Japan, to say nothing of South
America. Finally, they secured a footing in the very
homes of their rivals, England, Germany and France.
The transmontane region of the United States is
likely to repeat at least a part of this programme.
That it will in time achieve complete independence in
the manufacture of metals one can scarcely doubt. It
is hardly less. probable that it will compete with the
East some day in Japan, China and Australia."
In such predictions there may be something of ex
aggeration, but that is a minor matter. The point
of interest is that the East has begun to give heed to
the manufacturing possibilities of California and the
coast generally. It is now perceived that with the
development of the Orient there will come a demand
for manufactured goods which will be a strong stim
ulus to the upbuilding of factories here. The thing

SELECTION OF BARD.
Stockton Independent.
The nomination of Hon. Thomas R.
Bard of Ventura for United States Sena
tor last nipht by the Republican caucus
will be hailed by Republicans generally
throughout the State as a happy relief
from the strained political situation that
has lasted a year. Thomas R. Bard Is
a gentleman who stands high In the Re
publican councils of the State. The only
charge ever made against him to our
knowledge is that of his being rich. In
1592 he headed the list of Electors on the
Harrison ticket, and the people In the
coast counties where he is known were
fo anxious to honor him that he ran
ahead of his ticket and was the only Har
rison Elector chosen in this State. Mr.
Bard is clean, energetic and distinguished
for good Judgment. It is to be hoped that
the legislators will dispose of the Senator
ship on the first "ballot next Tuesday by
indorsing the action of the caucus. Those
who preferred other candidates can well
afford to waive their preferences in the
satisfaction of ending a disagreeable con
test that was injuring the party as well
as the State.

THE DEFEAT OF THE RAILROAD.
Bi the defeat of the Senatorial candidacy of
Burns the Republicans of the Legislature have
saved the State from a menace of discredit
amounting to dishonor. It is something to have
aeaten and baffled the impudent pretensions of a
lotorious defaulter, and to have repudiated his claims
:o leadership in the party. Those things, however,
ire comparatively minor results of the victory. The
feature of most importance, the matter of deepest
significance, is that the battle was gained over the
Southern Pacific Railroad. The defeat of Burns was
.he defeat of the Kentucky corporation, the victory
or the people was an overthrow of those banded
orces of corruption that work the will of Huntingdon
n faiifnrnia nnlitirs
A man of Burns' limited abilities, great offenses
Â£i:d disgraceful public and private record could not
of himself have attained much influence in Califor
nia or in the Republican party. The power that en
abled him to hold a prominent position as a candi
date for the United States Senate and to make a
fight for more than a year against the conscience
and the indignation of decent Republicans was fur
nished to him by the Southern Pacific Railroad. In
rrar.y respects the fight was against Herrin more than
against Burns. It was Herrin that put the disrep
utable candidate in the forefront of the battle, and it
was Herrin and his colleagues of the Southern Pa
cific Company that supported him in every phase of
the contest. With the fall of Burns, therefore, Huh
tington, Herrin and all the banded conspirators fell
dewn, and honesty had a complete triumph over the
forces of corruption.
At no stage of the conflict was there a compromise.
From the time the Southern Pacific Company put
Euros forward aÂ§ a candidate for the Senate the gen
uine Republicans of California never for a moment
wavered in the determination to cru*h the con
spiracy utterly. They came up to attend the extra
session with that determination stronger than ever.
In the selection of Mr. Bard the agents and the offi
cials and the touts and the bosses of the Southern
Pacific Railroad had no voice whatever. They were
not consulted, they were not heeded, they were not
e\cn heard. They were driven out of the counsels of
the party and made to understand they had no right
The result is gratifying to all Californians. but it is
particularly so to stalwart Republicans, who perceive
that this victor}' is another of those which add to the
honor of the party. It is one more proof that when put
to the test the Republican party never fails to uphold
the right and maintain unimpaired the lofty principles
of its illustrious founders. Parasites may attach them
Â¦sclvcs to the party for the sake of living upon it,
predatory men may join it for the sake of preying
Xipan it. hypocrites may enter its rank? for the sake
of getting offices or honors by fraud; but all these
classes combined are powerless to weaken it or cor
rupt it. Whenever there arises any issue between the
rascals and honesty, the party never fails to clean the
camp and put the traitorous rogues to flight. .
That is what has happened in this case. Mr. Bard
is a Straight-out anti-railroad man. He owes nothing
to the Kentucky corporation. That organization did
not give him a single vote. He stands for the stal
wart, independent, honest Republicanism of Califor
nia. He has not only defeated Burns, but he has
triumphed over the Southern Pacific Railroad and
all its* gangs and bosses. , yi
A NEW PLATFORM FOR DEMOCRACY
SINCE there appears no way by which Democ
racy can get rid of Bryan and make the con
test this year under a new leader, some of the
thinkers of the party hope to obtain variety by fur
nishing the party with a new platform. One of these
L c D. Cady Eaton of New Haven, and he has been
kind enough to favor The Call with an outline of his
programme.
He proposes these things: First â Repeal the tax
on State banks, thus restoring to the States the right
of regulating their finances. Second â Limit the
powers, privileges and activities of corporations to
the State creating them and require that all officers
and directors be citizens of those States. Third â
Forbid the acquisition of any territory which by
geographical distance or ethnical difference of popu
lation may not, within the periods and in the man
ner prescribed by the constitution, return Congres
sional representatives who are capable of taking part
in the government of the United States. Fourth-
Require Congress to exercise the constitutional right
of regulating the value of American coins. Fifth â
Limit the grant of pensions by the National Gov
ernment to the veterans of the regular forces of the
army and the navy, relegating the care of volunteers
to their respective States.
The fourth plank, that referring to the regulation
of the value of coin, requires some explanation. The
author of the programme says: "The increasing
and cheapening production of gold and silver and the
consequent changes in the relative values of these
metals should suggest to Congress that a period may
have arrived for the exercise of its constitutional
right to 'regulate' the value of American coins. If,
as some economists assert, the purchasing power of
gold is steadily decreasing, then to preserve the
American dollar as a standard of value there should
from time to time be added to it a sufficiency of
metal to preserve its original value. That the
framers of the constitution anticipated the arrival of
such periods is evident from the power given to Con
gress to 'regulate' the value of coins whenever regu
lation should become necessary."
That plank kills the whole programme. The
mere reading of it will make a silver man shudder.
When a party has been asserting that gold is rising
in value and that the free coinage of unlimited silver
i? necessary for the welfare of the down-trodden
masses, it is something like an insult to suggest to its
leaders that they adopt a platform calling for an in
crease in the amount of gold in the existing standard.
Mr. Eaton, however, appears to be quite free from any
thought of insulting Democracy. He seems to be an
earnest man, indeed, for he closes his paper with the
solemn warning: ,"If the people of the United
States are no longer capable of taking care of them
selves, or are tired <Â«? the effort, then let the forms
and manners of republicanism be given up and those
of imperialism substituted, for the uncertainties of
the present state of affairs are intolerable. The sway
of a modern, hereditary and intelligent despot, suf
ficiently secure in his position to have time to give
car to the complaints of his subjects, is less to be
feared than the tyranny of ephemeral, political and
financial bosses whose only thought 'is to make their
rule of a day most profitable to themselves and fol
lowers. This country cannot be held together much
longer except by establishing an absolute, central
despotism, or by restoring to the States of the Union
their sovereign rights under the constitution. Which
do the people prefer?"
The Boers have at last begun to deal with fire in
finitely more dangerous than that which belches
from British guns. Kruger's agents are offering to
Continental nations the tremendous monopolies that
have brought disaster as concessions to England.
THE ORIENTAL TRADE.
IN the course of an address on Friday before the
Chamber of Commerce of San Diego, John If.
Webb, a gentleman who is now engaged in pro
moting American trade with the Japanese, pointed
out that while it costs the producers of Southern
California from $34 to $.}S a ton to ship their
products to the Chicago market, the same goods
can be delivered at Yokohama for from $6 to $7 per
ton. In that fact alone can be seen the benefit which
California will derive when her products find their
markets in the Orient rather than in the Eastern
States or in Europe.
American trade in Japan and China is increasing
rapidly as it is, but would increase more rapidly if
more attention were paid to it. Our Consuls have
repeatedly pointed out that one of the main reasons
why there is not a larger demand for ' California
fruits in the Orient is the lack of proper packing.
Our goods are put up to suit the American trade,
and we have not yet learned the advantage of packing
it to suit the demand in Asia. It has been stated, for
example, that fruit packed in tin is not suitable for
that climate, and that we shall have to pack it in
glass if we are to have the full benefits of the trade.
Reports of that kind emphasize the need of the
establishment of the Commercial Museum, which will
show to our producers, manufacturers and merchants
exactly the kind of goods and sort of packing that
are demanded in the various Pacific Ocean markets.
The advices of Consuls are helpful, but they fall far
short of what will be done in the way of enlighten
ment by the comprehensive object lessons of the pro
posed museum. In the meantime it is evident we are
expending our energies in the wrong direction when
we pay $3S a ton to ship goods to a -poor market by
rail, while a better market awaits us across the sea,
which we can reach at less than one-sixth the cost.

THE SENATORIAL CAUCUS.
NO one has denied that among the supporters of
Burns there were honest men and good Re
publicans; grievously deceived as to public
sentiment or perhaps unduly led by a sense of po
litical obligation or of personal friendship they may
have been, but they retained personal and partisan in
tegrity. They were led, by the often expressed desire
of Burns to submit to a caucus, to believe in his will
ingness to submit to party usage and take whatever
came of its application.
New a caucus has been organized, its permanent
chairman has been elected, its rules have been fixed
and it has acted. It was a manly caucus, for it voted
openly, and no man in it could hide behind a secret
ballot. It was so organized, its doings were so frank
and public, that no secret machinery could actuate it.
It proves not to be the kind of caucus that Burns
wanted, but it is the kind the Republican party
wanted. In it there was not a shadow of anything
secret or sinister. It was the manly voice of Cali
fornia Republicanism, bravely and openly uttered for
all men to hear. It brought to a close, under party
tries and authority, a most unusual, most extraor
dinary contest. Its decision has upon its luster no
tarnish, no corruption, no stain even of bargain ani
agreement. Its choice goes to the Senate with no
smell of smoke on the clean garments of a reputa
tion that no man has ever attacked. California is
highly honored by the Republican choice. With the
only other Western State that has had a remarkable
contest for a*seat in the present Senate, daily held up
to derision and aversion by the revelations of an in
vestigation, which seem to prove a condition of pub
lic morals that make Sodom a New Jerusalem by
comparison, California may well exalt her horn that
she has plucked the flower safety from the nettle
danger, and is able to go with unsullied name to
take the great oath in the person of Senator Bard.
We have the right to say to the honest men in the
following of Burns that they cannot afford by tech
nical haggling to run the risk of passing out of the
class in which the State and party are still willing to
put them. They have seen their candidate beaten in
a fair fight, in an open field, after a year has gone by
in which he had ample time and tether to make good
his promise to them of ability to get a majority. Let
this content them and let them join the rejoicing
ranks of California Republicans, who are sure that
this result means victory in this Presidential year and
who respond to its raptures and thrill to its coming.
As for the other class of supporters who followed
Colonel Burns, they must consult their prudence for
reasons that will justify them in keeping a promise
made in their name. They wanted a caucus, signed
its call and are perfectly aware of what hap
pens in such cases to those who refuse to abide by
the result. They have seen the whole State rise up
and salute the victor, satisfied that he represents its
honor and will heighten its fame. They don't want
the State to do more. They don't want it to put on
the ermine and the black cap and pronounce a sen
tence that will brand the forehead of every man it
touches. The party has spoken. Its voice is of glad
tidings. Let if be so.

SUGGESTION
Common Sense and Pru-
dence Suggest Buying
Between Seasons.
B!G OFFERINGS THIS WEEK
So long as you have to lose at all
tou better lose first than last, for the
first loss is the best loss.
In a progressive age like this the
merchant who is bound to stand at
the head of the class takes advantage
of early situations and first opportun-
ities to dispose of goods, that while
they may be in season all the time are
sometimes out of season. Parlor
Suits, Chamber Suits, China Closets
and things of that kind are always
in season. But there are times when
there ara more people buying them
than at other times. In other words,
there are seasons for buying and sea-
sons for selling, and the buying and
the selling seasons come together,
like. It is the in-between seasons that
prudent home-makers benefit most by
taking advantage of the extraordin-
nry Bargains which must necessarily
follow on the trail of extensive sell-
ing in season.
S5O CHAMBER SUITS, $39.
It is a fixed rule in Pattosien's
stores â the great three-acre store,
comer Sixteenth and Mission streets.
and the big Branch store in San Jose â
to keep busy in season and out of sea-
son, and it docs not matter if they
have to cut prices, in half to do it â
end hence ths big- bargains in fine
Axminsters at SI 05, \rorth $1 35;

Boland Now Counting.
Under Judge Seawell's ruling permitting
John Farnham to amend his contest to
the office of Public Administrator and ad

giving Farnham a majority, the "buck"
was passed to Patrick Boland.. and yester
day afternoon his attorneys took up the
recount of the ballots left untouched by
Farnham. At the opening of court Bo
land interposed a demurrer to the amend
ments to Karnham's contest, but the court
overruled the demurrer. Registrar WalPh
was railed to testify as to his belief in
the correctness of the returns of the pre
cincts untouched in the recount. Farn

WILL COMMAND THE MISSOURI
Well-Deserved for Major
It. J. Gibson, Surgeon, U. S. A.
On the arrival of the hospital ship Mis
souri, due here in a week. Major R. J.
Gibson, surgreon, U. S. A., who has for
several months past been sanitary inspec
tor of the transport service here, will be
assigned to command her, and her present
commander. Major William H. Arthur,
surgeon, U. S. A., will be assigned to the
position now held by Major Gibson.
The Missouri is the finest hospital ship
in the service. She was the vessel loaned
to the Government in July of ISsSS by the
Atlantic Transport Line to be used during
the Spanish war as a hospital ship. She
was fitted up with all the modern appli
ances and for several months did good
service. At the end of that time she was
put chafed by the Government and was
permanently commissioned as a hospital
fhip. She was sent to Brooklyn to be
remodeled in still better shape and then
she vas sent out to the Philippines. She
Is now coming here with over 300 sick for
the general hospital at the Presidio.
The Missouri Is 320 feet long, 49 feet
beam and 29 feet 6 Inches depth of hold.
She is fitted with triple-expansion engines
and can make eleven knots. In her medi
cal department she carries, besides the
surgeon major in command, four medical
officers, two acting assistant surgeons,
two hospital stewards, seven acting hos
pital stewards, forty-seven privates of the
Hospital Corps, eleven contract male
nurses, one chief cook, four assistants,
one laundryman and three cabin boys.
Major Gibson has proved himself to be
a zealous and efficient officer in the sani
tary inspection of the transports, and his
appointment to the command of the Mis
souri is official recognition of his worth.
It Is probable that the stay of the Mis
souri in this port will not be a long one.
COLONEL THOMAS M. CLUFF, a member of the firm of Cluff Broth
ers, wholesale grocers, died early yesterday morning at his home, 1714
Vallejo street. His death was the result of blood poisoning, superin
duced by erysipelas, the first symptoms of which appeared eleven days
ago.
During the entire course of the disease Mr. Cluff was In an unconscious
condition. Three days ago blood poisoning set in and from that time to his
death his life was in the balance.
Colonel Cluff was 41 years of age and a native of Trellick, Ireland. When
he was 19 he came to this country and net out Immediately for San Francisco.
Upon his arrival in this city he engaged in the grocery business with his
brothers, two of whom have since died. Twelve years ago Mr. Cluff married
Miss Margaret Wethard, who, with two children, survives him. His brother,
William Cluff, his. business partner, is now In Europe.
The announcement of the colonel's death was received with feelings of
regret in all branches of the National Guard in this city. There was no man
connected with the guard who was more respected by the rank and file than
was Colonel Cluff. In the various positions he held he always worked for
the best interests of the soldiery of the State and he did ,all that any one
man could do to place it In the front rank of the National Guards of the
country. His good Judgment in the management of its affairs and his wise
counsel in its deliberations will be missed. He held the position of assistant
adjutant general on the staff of Major General Dickinson.
Lieutenant Colonel D. E. Miles, signal officer on the division staff, was
Instructed by Major General Dickinson to look after the funeral arrange
ments so far as the military was concerned. In this the lieutenant colonel
was assisted by Leo Schmitt of the division staff..
Colonel Cluff was a member of King Solomon Lodge No. 260, Free and
Accepted Masons; a member of San Francisco Chapter No. 1, Royal Arch
Masons; a sir knight of California Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar; a
noble of Islam Temple, Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic Shrine; a member
of San Francisco Lodge No. 3 of the Protective Benevolent Order of Elks,
and a member of California Council No. 530 of the National Union.
Colonel Cluff became connected with the National Guard by being com
missioned first lieutenant and appointed ordnance officer of the First Infan
try. June 22. ISS7. He was then commissary and quartermaster of the regi
ment, and on May 23, 1595, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel and ap
pointed commissary on the division staff. In July of that year he was ap
pointed division inspector of rifle practice and in 1596 he was appointed di
vision commissary. A year later he was appointed paymaster and on the
27th of January, 189S, was commissioned colonel and appointed assistant ad
jutant general on the major general's staff," which position he held at the
time of his death.
The Masonic services for the dead will be conducted by King Solomon
Lodge in King Solomon's Hall in the Masonic Temple at 1 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon. California Commandery, Knights Templar, will act as funeral
escort and there will also be a representation from the Royal Arch Masons.
At a meeting last night in division headquarters in the Mills building
preliminary arrangements were made for the funeral. It was decided that
there should be eight active pallbearers, to bo chosen from sergeants of
the National Guara. and the following honorary pallbearers to represent the
various associations the late colonel was connected with: From the division
staff, Lieutenant Colonel Louis Barrere and Lieutenant Colonel W. A. Hal
stead; the Governor's staff. Lieutenant Colonel W. D. Sanborn and Lieu
tenant Colonel Frank Vail; the brigade staff, Major H. B. Hosmer and Ma
jor C. J. Evtns; the naval militia. Captain N. T. James and Lieutenant
Commander Thomas A. Nerney; the California Commandery, Knights Tem
plar, Thomas Morton and George Donney; the San Francisco Chapter, Royal
Arch Masons, to be selected; the Protective Benevolent Order of Elks, H.
S. Manning and Dr. A- P. O'Brien; the National Union, Thomas J. Harris
and Ernest C. Stock; the friends of the family, to be named, and from
the King Solomon Lodge, F. and A. M., to be named.
It was decided Jast evening that the Oakland companies of the National
Guard, Troop A of the Militia Cavalry, the Signal Corps of the Second Bri
gade and the Naval Reserves from the United States steamship Marion shall
be ordered out as an escort at the funeral. The whole will be under' com
mand of Colonel Whitton of the Fifth Infantry, N. G. C. A guard of honor
has already been placed over the body. Further arrangements for the fu
neral will be made to-day.
ernoon Boland again took up the recount.
It is probable that all the ballots will now
be counted and a correct recapitulation of
the various precincts secured and the
right of the parties litigant to the office
determined without technicality of law.
Yesterday afternoon six precincts were
counted and Boland made a net gain of
ten votes.
ONE OF THE GREAT
INVENTIONS OF THE DAY
Destined to Add Largely to the Gold
Production of- the World.
History teaches us that as a rule when
a great exigency arises, no matter how
difficult it may seem to meet the require
ments, some one comes to the front and
solves the problem.
â¢ '5 Â«Â¦ doubtful if in many years has the
Inventive mind of man been so intensely
focused on a problem as in the past few
months since the discovery of the vast
gold-bearing sand deposits of Cape Xcme
and Cape York. Practical hydraulic min
ers realize what a difficult task it is to re
cover even a small percentage of fine gold
from black or ruby sand in the ordinary
sluice box or flume, for the reason that
the sand packs the riffles and neutralizes
the saving device provided.
In the past few months all sorts of de
vices, some with more or less merit oth
ers thoroughly impracticable, have'beon
on exhibit in this city. But there has re
cently been shown in operation a machine
which seems to receive the indorsement
of the most thorough practical miners
mining engineers and mineralogists with
out exception. Reference is made to what
is known as the Moore Improved Gold
Separator and Rotary Amalgamator,
which Is now on exhibition at G9 Steven
son street, this city, and it is a great sat
isfaction to call . the attention of mlnirg
men to this machineâ not only those con
templating going to the Cape Nome coun
try, but also all who have either gravel
or black sand deposits In this or any other
section.
Tho salient features of this machine ore
first, that It has the same motion in the
panning that a Chinaman, who excels in
that work, has in panning gravel in an
ordinary gold pan, and the agitating fin
gers have a lateral motion and perfo-m
the same service on a large scale that the
man does In stirring up the gravel in a
gold pan in order to give the gold an op
portunity to gravitate to the bottom of
the pan.
The machine which is in operation at 69
Stevenson street seems to have a capacity
far beyond what was claimed by the i:i
ventor. Mr. \V. A. Monroe, one of the
most experienced mill men In the State,
while running the machine stated that it
was simply wonderful in Its capacity ami
efficiency. The owners of this invention
are to build a machine which one man
can furnish the power for that will work
from thirty to forty tons of sand or gravel
dally. Certainly the development of this
invention has come to the front at tho
most opportune time, and its very exten
sive use in the Cape Nome district, as well
as in many other sections, is inevitable.
It requires less than one miner's inch of
water to run the machine to its full ca
pacity and less than one- horse powÂ«r,
and from the indications as to the amount
of gravel paftsed through the rotary cyl
inder, it will handle at least 200 tons of
gravel every twenty-four hours and sive
a very much higher percentage of the gold
than in other devices. It is most simple
in its construction and wonderful in its
results. It has been in practical operation
on gravel intermixed with clay for the
past twelve months, and reports from the
owners of the mine state that the machine
is without comparison in the results fur
nished, seldom a trace of gold being: found
in the tailings of gravel running from
SI 50 to $10 per ton.

Report of the Senate
Committee.
LAWS SHOULD BE REVISED
LOW TARIFF PREFERABLE TO
FREE TRADE.
?
Committee Considers That Congnss
May or May Not Extend thÂ»
Constitution, as It
Sees Fit
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â The Senate
Committee on Porto Rico to-day conclud
ed its consideration of the bill providing
a form o" government for the Island of
Porto Rico. The bill stands in all essen
tial particulars the same as left by the
committee at its meeting last Wednes
day. The rate of duty provided for arti
cles brought to the United States from
Porto Rico and articles taken from the
United States to Porto Rico Is 25 per cent
of the Dingley law rate. Senator Foraker,
chairman of the committee, prepared a
report, which has been adopted by the
committee, and will be submitted by bill
to the Senate next Monday. Tho report
says:
The purpose of the bill Is to provide tempo
rary civil government for Porto Rico to con
tinue until the law and ordinances now In force
in the island can be revised and codified and
a more permanent form of government be
framed by a committee to be appointed by the
President.
The necessity for a committee of this char
acter is manifest because Its laws and Judicial
systems and codes of procedure, as well as the
political conditions generally, now existing In
Porto Rico are co widely different from ours
as to make It Impossible to do such work, in
telligently and comprehensively without that
wider and more, accurate knowledge that can
be obtained only by visiting the island and
studying the whole situation, as it there ex
ists.
Because the legislation now under consider
ation is Intended to stand only temporarily,
the committee has sought to limit It to only
such changes In existing laws and conditions
as appear necessary to quickly accomplish the
purposes that are thought to be essential to
thÂ« peace and prosperity of the island. Gen
erally stated the propositions are:
1. To substitute a civil for a military gov
ernment.
2. To accord to the native Porto Rlcans aa
much participation therein as It may be for
the best Interests, of all concerned to- give them.
3. To avoid as 'far as possible radical changes
In the laws, courts and codes of procedure and
yet make such modifications and alterations aa
are necessary to dispense with the most ob
jectionable features of Spanish government and
Judicial administration.
4. To provide a legislative authority that can
deal with all domestic subjects of legislation.
5. To extend the navigation laws of the
United States to the Island and enact such tar
iff. Internal revenue and other provisions as are
necessary to afford a revenue for the support
of the government and to meet the expenses
of such public instruction and public Improve
ments as should be undertaken and in this be
half authorize, to a limited extent, the raising
of funds by Issuing municipal and Insular
bonds In anticipation of revenues.
6. To retire Porto Rican coins now In cir
culation and substitute coins of the United
States therefor.
7. To authorize and regulate the granting of
public and quasi public franchises..
The report further says that the ques
tions which gave the committee most
concern were, first, as to whether or not
the constitution should be extended to
Porto Rico, and. In the second place,
what provision should be made with re
spect to the tariff duties and internal
revenue taxes.
Attention is called In detail to the legis
lation relating to Territories In the past
to Bhow that there is abundant precedent
for not extending the provisions of the
constitution to territory of the United
States, for which Congress may be called
upon to legislate. That it is within the
constitutional power of Congress to either
extend or withhold the constitution in all
euch cases, as it may deem advisable, will
appear from the authorities hereinafter
cited in support of the proposition that
Congress has constitutional power to
legislate according to the provisions of
this bill with respect to Important duties,
to which provisions attention is now
called.
The bill as Introduced provided for free
trade between the United States and Por
to Rico. This proposition was objected to
on various grounds. It was urged that.
Firstâ lt was in violation of the policy
of protection.
Secondâ lt was Inimical to the Interests
of the United States, with which Porto
Rican products would come into competi
tion.
Thirdâ lt would be a precedent that
would have to be followed In other cases
that might hereafter arise, where the
competition resulting might be still more
Injurious to American Interests.
Vhese were, at least, the principal ob
jections urged before the committee. The
committee carefully considered all of
thorn with the result that they do not re
gard the objections as well taken.
After citing the productions of Porto
Rico the report says:
So far as the objection Is concerned that what
Is done with regard to Porto Rico will be a
precedent that must be followed In dealing with
the PhllirP' nfs an< l other Islands we may ac
quire, the committee thinks It enough to say
that such a result does not necessarily follow.
In the opinion of the committee each casÂ«
stands on its own merits and Congress is not
bound in one by what It may see fit to do
in another. Its power Is plenary and It may
do as It likes.
It was decided, however, to Impose the
duty and provide for a duty on goods en
tering Porto Rico, so as -to provide reve
nue for the island. Further, the report
says:
The committee recognizes that In not extend
ing the constitution and making It apply to
Porto Rico, and especially by the provisions
it reports In this bill with respect to tariff
duties, it raises Important questions as to the
constitutional power of Congress to enact such
legislation. Notwithstanding all* that has been
said to the contrary a majority of the com
mittee is of the opinion that Congress has such
power.
With respect to citizenship the report
states:
It Is within our discretion to make the in
habitants of Porto Kico citizens of the United
States or not, so it is within, the power and
discretion of Congress to make" the Inhabitants
of the Phlllpoines and other islands we may
acquire citizens or withhold that Quality from
them. It is also within the power of Congress
to regulate and restrict and prohibit. If thought
advisable, the passing of the Inhabitants of the
Philippines or other islands from their country
Into ours, or to prevent the products of their
labor from coming Into unjust competition with
the labor of this country. With respect to this
whole matter Congress has now, since annexa
tion, and will continue to have, complete and
unquestioned power to legislate as it may see
flt, and hence continue to afford the same pro
tection aa heretofore given in all this parti
cular. It will be simply a question of policy
hereafter In each case, as it may arise, aa It
Is now and heretofore.
Senators Gallinger and Perkins of the
committee, while assenting to the main
features of. the report, except to some
portions of it, are against any proposition
for free trade with the islands. They as
sert that if Porto Rico was an Integral
part of the United States no tariff differ
ence from that which applies to the
United States could be maintained. They
also believe that some Interests of the
United States would suffer from free
trade with the Island and revert to the
cheap labor and other conditions with
which the United States could not com
pete. __ili-v Â¦'â¢''
DEATH OF THE GENIAL
COLONEL "TOM" CLUFF

PERSONNEL OF
THE COMMISSION
Men Who May Go to the
Philippines.
SCHURMAN WILL DECLINE
.
COLONEL DENBY AND PROFES
SOR WORCESTER SLATED.
Latest Reports From. General Otis
Show That Satisfactory Progress
Is Being Made at
Cebu.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â
Now that the President has received the
report on the Philippines prepared by the
Schurman Commission, active consldera
"tion is being given to the membership of
the proposed commission to establish civil
government in the islands.
It seems certain that Colonel Charles
Dc-nby, if he finds he can go. and Pro
fessor Dean C. Worcester, will be two
members. Judge M. T. Taft of West Vir
ginia Is under consideration and It is
thought he can be induced to accept the
appointment. James B. Angell and Judge
Thayer of Massachusetts have also been
mentioned, but it is not believed the latter
will accept.
While Mr. McKinley would like Presi
dent Schurman to return to Manila, Mr.
Schurman thinks he cannot go back and
his name has not been considered in con
nection with the new commission.
It Is hardly likely that the commission
will be able to leave for Manila for sev
eral weeks, as Professor Worcester is en
gaged in the compilation of one of the
volumes of the Schurman Commission's
reports, which deals with the physical
and sociological conditions of the Philip
pines.
General Otis' latest report of military
operations Jn the Philippines shows that
rapid progress is being made in opening
up the hemp ports in the islands south
of Luzon. Colonel Kobbe, In command of
an expedition into the islands of Samar
and Leyte, adjoining Luzon on the south
east, reports the capture of three of the
most important towns of the islands and
of large quantities of hemp at these
points. General Otis' cablegram, received
at the War Department, is as follows:
MANILA, Feb. 3.â Kobfx* reports from Obu
thÂ» occupation by his troops of Calbayoc and
CatbaloKan, In Pamar, and Tarloban. In Iyyte.
Opposition was made of thes* three points.
The insurgents endeavored to burn Calbayoc
and Catbalosan. without success, except to
cause pllfht destruction to the last town.
Kobbe drove the Insurgents under .General Laik
ban into the mountains, capturing a large ar
renal and powder house, L.ukbanÂ°i> baggage and
money and all his artillery. At Tacloban the
Insurgent loss in. killed was ten. No casualties
to our trooD3. Knbbe captured at all points
thirty pieces of artillery, a good many rifles,
stores and ammunition. I^aree quantities of
hemp at various ports were eeized by Kobbe,
and thirty merchant vessels are engaged in
transporting the same to Cebu and Manila-

self into trouble in Judge Fritz's court
yesterday afternoon. He was the com

till the case was called he saw Attorney

out a complaint charging him with per
jury.
"What's that you are doing?" he an
grily asked, and promptly slapped Har
ding's face. Before he could strike again

liceman Walsh. The Judge, after repri
manding Smith, ordered him into custody

DAYLIGHT ROBBERY.
Sensational Story of a Woman As-
saulted in a Public Street.
Mrs. John C. Spinney, wife of the well
known insurance manager, says she was
beaten and robbed at noon yesterday in
the center of a much-traveled thorough
fare of the Mission. She says the as
sault was committed just as she alighted
from an electric car and as she was step
ping on the sidewalk.
Mrs. Spinney is suffering from a severe
ly bruised eye, but cannot tell whether
she waa hit with a hand or a cane, as she
was stunned by the blow and before she
had recovered the robbers had run away.
"I had Just alighted from a car at Thir
teenth" and Mission streets," said Mrs.
Spinney last night, "when I was hit over
the eye. 1 was about to step on the side
walk when I received the blow. I noticed
two men standing there, when I ap
proached, but being broad daylight I
never dreamed that one of them would
strike me. While looking partly down
ward I was struck and the same instant
mv purse was snatched out of my hand.
I "did not fall, but stood a few seconds
dazed, and when I recovered my senses
the fellows had run off. I never saw
either of them before in my life, but I
could recognize them again if I ever meet
them." My purse contained about $30. My
eye is very seriously hurt but the sight is
not in danger."
Mr. Spinney reported the assault to the
police and a detective was detailed on the
case, but no one had seen anything of the
robbery or the robbers.

MANAUENSE
HAS ARRIVED
FROM MANILA
Investigation Will Be
Held at Once.
The transport Manauense passed In last
evening just too late to catch the doctor,
so she anchored off Harbor View to await
inspection this morning. She will prob
ably follow in the wake of the Australia
through the fumigation process, for she
touched at Honolulu to coal while on her
way here.
The Manauense was the vessel that took
part of the Thirty-iirst Infantry, under
command of lieutenant Colonel ebb
Hayes, to Manila last fall. When she
reached Manila her passengers told sensa
tional stories of breakdowns and leaking
boilers, all of which have appeared in dis
patches.
As a consequence an investigation was.
ordered by army headquarters and pend
ing the result the charter money for the
vessel has been withheld. The investiga
tion in this department is in charge of
Lieutenant Colonel Maus. inspector gen
eral of the department. He will examine
the ship's officers and crew and will make
his report to Washington through these
department headquarters.
When the vessel left here it was con
sidered that she was fit for sea and later
reports from her have led to the infer
ence that her trouble was due to neglect
aboard.

CATARRH OFJHE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Â¦..' Â¦* ". Â¦â Â¦ Â¦.* '-â¢Â¦Â¦.-Â¦ . . '
Catarrh of the stomcch has long bÂ«Â«a
considered the next thins to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
ing sensation after eating, accompanied
sometimes -with sour or â¢watery risings, a
formation of gases, causing pressure an
the heart end lungs and difficult hreattt-
ing headaches, fickle appetite, nervous-
ness and a general played out. languid
feeling.
There Is often a foul taste In the mouth.
coated tongue, and if the interior of tha
stomach could be seen It would show a
slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and obsti-
nate trouble is found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment and
irritate the deltcata mucous surfaces of
the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy digestion is the . one necessary
thing to do and when normal' digestion
is secured the catarrhal condition will
have disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson, the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase.
Aseptic Pepsin, a little Nux. Golden Seal
and fruit acltls. These tablets can now
be found at all drug stores under
the nan? of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and not beir.g a patent medicine can be
used with perfect safety and assurance
that healthy appetite and thorough di-
gestion win follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn atreet.
Chicago. 111., writes: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold
in the head, whereby the lining mem-
brane of the nose becomes Inflamed and
the poisonous discharge therefrom pass-
ing backward into the throat reaches tha
stomach, thus producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities prescribed
for m"* for three years for catarrh of
stomach without cure. but. to-day I am
the happiest of men after using only one
box of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I can-
not find appropriate word 3 to express my
good feeling. I have found fle3h, appetite
and sound rest from their use." ; " '. .
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest
preparation as well as the . simplest and
most convenient remedy for any form of
indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, bil-
iousness, sour stomach, . heartburn and

THE CALL'S HOME STUDY CIRCLE has the co-operation. and support of the leading
literary and college men of the country. The following writers will contribute to the
Spring Term courses: . : ;
We know that active brain work
throws out the phosphate of potash, for
this product is found on the skin after
excessive brain work, therefore, brain
workers, in order to keep well, must
have proper food containing: phosphate
of potash to quickly rebuild the used-up
tissue. That one can obtain such food
has been proven in thousands of cases
among users of Postum Cereal Food
Coffee and Grape-Nuts.
Both contain phosphate of potash in
minute particles, just as it is furnished
by nature in the grains.
This product makes from albumen
the gray matter that builds the brain
and fills the nerve centers.
In no way can this gray matter be
made except by the action of phosphate
of potash upon albumen, and this min-
eral should be introduced to the body
just as it comes from nature's labora-
tory, and not from the drugstore. The
system is more or less fastidious about
taking up the needed elements, and. as
might be suspected, it will favor the
products of Mother Nature rather than
the products of the xlruprshop. however
valuable they may be for certain uses.
Athletes, lawyers, journalists, doc-
tors, ministers, business men arfd others
who earn their living by the use of the
brain, are using both Postum Food Cof-
fee and Grape-Nuts Food. Both pro-
ducts are manufactured for a reason.
They were originated by an expert, arffl
the regenerative value of both the Pos-
tum Coffee and the Food has been dem-
onstrated beyond question. All first-
class grocers tell both Postum and
Grape- Nuts, and the Postum Cereal
Co.. Ltd., manufacture them at the Bat-
tle Creek factories.

SHOT BY A POLICEMAN.
Win. Flynn, a Crazy Man, Wounded
oil the Foot by L J. BeÂ«ly.
Policeman L. J. Deely ; distinguished
himself at an early hour yesterday morn
ing by shooting William Flynn, a crazy
man, in the foot and arresting him on
charges of assault with a deadly weapon
and vagrancy.
About 2 a. m. Deely was searching
freight cars at Center and Kentucky
streets for tramps and on opening the
door of one of the cars a rock was thrown
at him and missed him. Deely shouted
"I'm an ' oflicer," and a voice replied
"You keep away from here." A second
missile struck Deely, who then drew his
revolver and fired into the car and the
voice shouted "Don't shoot; I'll come
out."
Flynn came out of the car limping and
said the bullet had struck him on the
foot. Deely arrested him and took him
in the patrol wagon to the Receiving Hos
pital, whence, after his wounded foot was
attended to, he was taken to. the City
Prison.
Flynn's brother, Patrick, yesterday
mornlnp swore to a complaint charging
him with being insane and he was re
moved to the Insane ward In, the hos
pital for examination by the Commis
sioners. * "' .Vj.'/ii'.U

Hunt were the guests of Frank J. Caro
lan at a hunt breakfast at Burlingame
Club yesterday before the customary
Saturday run with the hounds. â¢ â¢ <
The guests asembled at 1 o'clock at the
clubhouse, where they were received by
Mr. Carolan. The scene on the balcony,
where luncheon was served, was a pictur
esque one. The air was soft" and. balmy
and the majority of the ladies wore the
brightest and daintiest of silken dresses.
The men were dressed for the hunt and
their velvet hunting caps, scarlet coats
and top boots would pass muster at any
fashionable meet in Europe. A string
quartet rendered popular melodies, which
floated softly out on the air above the
hum of conversation. During luncheon
Walter Hobart proposed three cheers for
Mr. Carolan, whose health was then drunk
standing. Later on Mr. Carolan return
ed the compliment,' proposing a toast. to
the first master of the hunt, Mr. Hobart,
to whom, he said, the members were
deeply indebted. The guests at the
luncheon Included:
Mrs. J. B. Crockett, Mr! and Mrs. Os
ffood Hooker, Miss Carolan, Peter D.
Martin, F. H. Bulkeley-Johnson, J.
Downey Harvey, Miss Harvey, Charles
Dunphy, J. J. Moore, Hugh Hume. Mr.
and Mrs. H. H. Hinshaw, Mr.
and Mrs. George Parsons, Mr. and
Mrs. E. D. Beylard, Mr. and
Mrs. W. H. Tubbs, Mrs. George
Howard, Joseph D. Grant, Mrs and Mrs.
J. H. P. Howard, Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Coleman, R. M. Tobin, Thomas -Driscoll.
A. B. McCreary, Mr. and Mrs. Walter. S.
Hobart, Mr. and Mrs. Lester, Colonel
and Mrs. Maus, Major J. L,. Rathbone.
Earl B. Hough, Mr. and Mrs. Hall Mc-
Allister and Duncan Hayne.
Shortly before 3 o'clock there was a
general movement toward the stables and
the horsemen were soon on their way to
the meet in groups of twos and threes.
A number of fine equipages were out,
notably a new bus of graceful design,
which Mr. Carolan placed at the disposal
of his guests. The hounds, in charge of
"Jerry" Keating, the huntsman, were
noon on the scene lending life and color
to the occasion. The drag had been laid
in ,& zigzag manner, which not only test
ed the hound's noses, but, better still, af
forded the spectators In carriages an ex
cellent opportunity to view the hounds
and the horsemanship of the big field.
They skirted about the Carolan place,
back to near the starting point, then into
the foothills and back through the field
in front of the ; clubhouse. They then
struck back into the foothills again and
were lost to view for over an hour until
near the finish.
This was at the polo field, where a
number of spectators had congregated.
The last jump into the road was a bad
one, as in addition to the fence there was
a bad ditch. The horses cleared it in
safety, no one being unseated. There
were a number .of falls during the course
of the run, but owing to the soft nature
of the earth the riders sustained no in-
Jury. Walter Hobart rode his great gray
horse Royalty, while Mr. Carolan had a
mount on one of the hunters he brought
from the East recently. The majority of
the field was splendidly mounted.
Among the well-known people in at the
finish were: Mr. Carolan, Walter Hobart,
Peter D. Martin, J. J. Moore, Thomas
Driscoll, Richard Tobln, Charles Dunphy,
J. Downey Harvey, Harry Howard, Mrs.
Harry Howard, the Misses Brltton and E.
D. Beylard. There was a general ex
change of compliments and the riders
went their several ways, not, however, un
til the ladles had been especially compli
mented for their skill and their courage.
A gentleman present who is in the habit
of hunting elsewhere was greatly sur
prised to find the pack run mute, instead
of making the hills echo and re-echo with
their music. This is one of the chief
charms of hunting, and is at once missed
by persons accustomed to hearing hounds
give tongue.
Some members of the field, in their an
thusiasm, committed the most unpardon
able breach of hunting etiquette â that of
overriding the hounds. Their proper place
is back of the master and the hunt ser
vants, and not ahead of or with the
hounds, where the steaming bodies of
their horses destroy the scent which the
hounds are following. The words of Mr.
Maynell. one of the noted masters of fox
hounds in England, would apply to a por
tion of the field. "First comes the fox,"
he said, "then Mr. Cecil Forrester and
afterward my hounds."

Observation.
VARIOUS INSTALLATIONS.
More Officers Who Have Been Placed
in Fraternal Chairs of Honor.
Commissioners Mendell, Manson and
Mahony of the Board of Public Works
and Civil Engineer Grunsky visited sev
eral of the county roads and other thor
oughfares yesterday afternoon for the
purpoee of acquainting themsenes with
their conditions with a view to ascertain
ing just what improvements are neces
sary.
The first road visited was the Ean Bru
no road, which was found to be drying
up and Improving naturally. It waa found
that the grades were less than the ele
vations should be, particularly beyond
Army to Gavin streets. The work on
the Mission road up to Amazon street was
found to be progressing favorably. For
the Mission and San Bruno roads $4900 is
available and it Is Intended by the board
to use this amount to the best advantage.
Fifteenth avenue waa visited by. the of
ficials and the grades as established found
to be low.
The construction of Nineteenth avenue,
which is to connect the park and Ocean
road, will be a very expensive work in the
opinion of the board. The sum of $10,003
is available for this purpose and in or
der that the amount may suffice it will
be necessary to take up the filling of Tro- ;
C adero Canyon Immediately so the' waste
material of private property surrounding
the gulch may be utilized to advantage.
The board at its next meeting will take
up the consideration of all matters ap
pertaining to the various roads visited by
them. v- Â¦Â¦-

AH SAY, SUSPECTED MURDERER.
There was suppressed excitement In
Judge Conlan's court for a few minutes
yesterday morning when it became known
that officers were guarding both exits and
that a murdeier was to be arrested in
open court. â¢ *
Ah Say, a Chinese, was arrested Thurs
day night by Sergeant Ellis on the charge
of visiting a house of ill repute. He ap
peared Friday morning and was convicted
and ordered to appear for sentence yes
terday morning. He had given $20 cash
bail.
Sergeant Ellis and Detectives McMahon
and Burke, who have been specially de
tailed in Chinatown to suppress the high
binders, had a suspicion that Ah Say was
one of the two men who murdered Wong
Yuen, a carpenter, at 2S'-_ Waverly place
January 6. and yesterday morning when
he came Into court and they heard his
voice their suspicion became a certainty.
They notified acting Chief Blggy and a
guard was placed at the doors of the
courtroom so that Ah Say could not es
cape. Judge' Conlan was Informed that
Ah Say was wanted on the charge of mur
der arid he consented In the ends of Jus
tice to the arrest being made In open
court.
As soon aa Ah Say was placed under ar
rest by McMahon and Burke Attorney
Mack, who represented the Chinese, raised
a vigorous protest. There was no com
plaint against his client and It was an un
heard of. proceeding for a man to be ar
rested In open court. If his client had a
revolver he would have a perfect right to
use It on the officers for unlawfully de
priving him of his liberty.
The Judge said that in ordinary cases if
a 'man was arrested In court he -would
look upon It as contempt, but this man
was accused of committing a murder and
he had no hesitation In permitting his
arrest In court. He instructed the officers
to take the prisoner away.
Ah Say was taken to the City Prison
and locked up In "the tanks" pending fur
ther developments, as the officers declare
that he not only murdered Wong Yuen,
but two others, recently. They want to
be- positive on the point before charging
him directly with the other two 'murders.
Ah Say was childlike and bland when
seen In the prison. He said he -had lived
In Portland for several years and only
came here three days ago. He could not
tell where he had been living here. He, of
course, denied knowing anything about the
murders. The officers say the accused
Chinese is a member of tha Suey Sing
ton*. .
WILY CHINESE SCHEME.
A few nights ago Ah Nlngr, a confiden
tial clerk formerly In the employ of Al
bert, the leading Chinese merchant of
Carson City, Nev., was arrested In China
town of this, city and taken back to the
Nevada capital. He had been accused by
his employer of having embezzled $3000,
but has now turned the tables by making
sensational allegations which have
caused uneasiness among Albert's San
Francisco creditors.
According to Ning's story his employer
owes large sums of money to San Fran
cisco merchants which he is either unable
â¢or, unwilling to pay. After Nlng had left
Carson the wily Albert sought to cloak
his deficiencies by the rumor that he had
been robbed. He thought' that King had
departed for China and could not be cap
tured, hence no one could dispute -his al
legations. Sheriff Kinney and deputies of
Carson acted promptly, however, and the
man was brought back to explain the
charges against him.
It is said that Albert's creditors In this
city will be obliged to suffer to the ex
tent of several thousand dollars. Nlng
claims that $800 Is still due him from the
merchant.

FIRST REGIMENT BACK
IN THE NATIONAL GUARD
SIX COMPANIES HAVE FOR
MALLY BEEN ACCEPTED.
Colonel A. K. Whitton to Command
Second Brigade During Absence
of General Warfield.
At last the First Regiment of Infantry
is seeing its way to get into the National
Guard once more. Advices have been re
ceived from headquarters to the effect
that Companies C, D, G, I, X and M have
been accepted and that they will be recog
nized from the 29th of last November, the
date on which they reported back under
the provisions of the act of the Legisla
ture authorizing volunteers from the Na
tional Guard In the Spanish-American war
to resume their former positions. Advices
have also been received announcing that
other companies have complied with the
technical requirements and that they will
be accepted during the current week.
When these shall have been accepted the
regiment will be in a position to go ahead
with regimental business, the most Im
portant of which will be the selection of
officers for the several companies.

iment. N. G. C, has been by orders placed
in command of the Second Brigade during
the temporary absence of Brigadier Gen
eral Warfield on a visit East, and Major

their long service in the Spanish-American
war, can make the regiment the finest
and most proficient that California has
ever had in the National Guard. Those
men who served during the war and have
signed the muster rolls have acquired suf
ficient military knowledge and pride as
soldiers to make perfect National Guards
men, while those who may come In as re
cruits can easily be brought up to the
standard. In the Empire State there was
the 'Dandy Fifth,' which gained a world
wide reputation. Why cannot San Fran
cisco get up the Dandy First? Tho me.i.
I hope, will be given some Instruction in
the drill known as 'setting-up exercise,'
for without this It Is Impossible to bring
men up to the carriage of regulars. Next
to that the men should be thoroughly in
structed in the school of the company,
for In doing this the captain of a com
pany will note a remancable Improvement
In his command. There has In the past
been too much 'twos right' and 'fours left'
and not enough of that which, simple ap
parently, every soldier should know and
which goes a great way to make a perfect
soldier of the man. The new men must
learn this, and the old men can assist
them. I hope that the First "will act .on
the suggestion and make that command
an organization of which the citizens of
new San Francisco shall feel proud."
ANOTHER TRANSPACIFIC
STEAMER LINE OUTLINED
TREATY TO OPEN TRADE BE
TWEEN JAPAN AND CHILE.
Minister Vicuna Speaks of His Orien
tal Mission and Its Importance
to Commerce.
C. M. Vicuna, Minister from Chile to the
United States and Japan, who arrived In
this city from the Orient two week 3 ago,
leaves to-day to resume . his duties at
Washington. "While here Mr. Vicuna has
been engag-ed in preparing: a report for his
Government on the mission that took him
to Japan. As the report has now been
completed and forwarded to the proper
authorities In Valparaiso, Mr. Vicuna oon
rer.ted last night to remove the veil of
mystery that has hung around his move
ments In the Orient.
The mission v.hich took him to Japan
was to arrange .for a commercial treaty
between that country and Chile. It has
been successfully accomplished. The
treaty has been drawn up and has re
ceived the ratification of the Japanese
Ooverr.ment and It now merely remains
for the Chilean Congress to Indorse the
work of its Minister to make the treaty
at once operative.
The treaty embodies Important ap^ee
ments besides containing the favored na
tion clause It, however, provides that
Chile shall have the right to grant certain
special privileges to its South American
neighbors if it sees fit to do so, and Japan
Fhall have the same right in regard to its
friends on the Asiatic side of the world.
In speaking of the matter yesterday Mr
Vicur.a said that in his opinion the treaty
paved the way for the growth of a mlphty
commerce between the two nations Japan
now uses about 500.000 tons of fert'Mzir.g
matter annually. Of this amount she im
ports about 300.000 tons from China and
Korea. Now Chile hus Immense fields of
nitrate of soda, which is acknowledged to
be the best fertilizer known. This could
be exported to Japan at a cost that would
be not above the price now paid for the
articles brought there from China and
Korea.
Japan Is a heavy exporter of tea. silk
pap^r, bric-a-brac, paper lanterns and
cheap cottons. Every one cf these articles
will find a ready market and quick sale
throughout Chile.
These goods are now bought by Chile In
large quantities from European houses
that Import them from Japan. Japan, in
turn, buys Immense quantities of nitrate
of silver and other Chilean products
through the same channels.
There is no reason why the two coun
tries could not trade directly with each
other to the mutual profit of both and
the treaty looking forward to such an ar
rangement makes special provision for the
establishment of a transpacific steanu>r
line as soon as the expected trade de
mands shall make it a remunerative ne
cesEitv.

COON TRAMP MIXES IN
WITH TIBURON SWELLS
: Personates Himself at a Masked
; Ball and Almost Carries Off
First Prize.
TIBURON society is in retirement Full three weeks before the dictates of
the church or the mandate of fashion has called time for the period of
sackcloth and ashes the Tiburon lady has put on her gown of gray and
refuses to see the world as viewed In a ballroom or over a cup of tea.
No Jolly masked ball, as is fashionable and usual, will bring the season to a
close over in the litOe village; in fact, the mere reference to a bal masque is
apt to make all Tiburon womankind faint, and thereby hangs a . taleâ on
which the little town has been buzzing ever 6ince Thursday evening last.
On that eventful night Foresters' Hall was the scene of a masked ball, for
which invitations were Issued to a select few. John Morby, boatman, was not
among the invited. However, he bore the lady patronesses of the affair no
grudge for their oversight, and when he saw a "coon" tramp hanging around
and observed how graceful he was, he forthwith asked the colored gentleman
If he would not give the ladles a treat and go to the ball. The tramp was not
proud and accepted.
With the aid of some excelsior securely stowed away under his vest and an
ebony mask he made his appearance at the scene of the festivities. He "per
sonated" a "coon." . He sang, he danced and he cakewalked, and his "colored
gentleman" airs were so charmingly natural that all the ladles followed him
around the hall and declared he was the best "character" present. The com
mittee agreed with the ladles and awarded the "coon tramp" the first prize.
Then came the fateful midnight hour. Masks were ordered removed. The fair
ones gathered around the hero of the hour, but at the first glimpse of his
shiny ebony face the floor was strewn with gasping maids and hysterical ma
trons.
One lady who had helped the prize-winner to readjust his shoe, which In the
mad excitement of the dance had slipped from his long flat foot, remained
unconscious for more than an hour.
After quiet was again restored It was decided that the "best lmpersonatod
character" should not be awarded a prize. He escaped uninjured, although
there has been some talk of a coat of tar and feathers for Mr. Morby, his so
cial sponsor.

Sensational End of Angelica Teresa
Antonucci, a Recent Arrival
Prom. Dawson
City.
? Â¦
Angelica Teresa Antonucci, an Italian
woman, 'probably 30 years of age, died
suddenly yesterday afternoon In Golden
Gate Park while riding a bicycle. The
woman was In company with Alfred
Mawry, a Frenchman with Whom she had
conducted a grocery store In Dawson
City.
Tha Coroner was notified and Deputies
Meehan, Brown and Flannigan were sent
for the body. In the presence of the
superintendent and others In the Mount
Zlon Hospital, where she had been
sent after tha accident, tha depu
ties searched the remains and found
a . certificate of deposit from the
Bank of British Columbia In "Van
couver for $8000; a draft for $4000 on
thÂ© First National Bank of Juneau and
currency to the amount of $215, besides
several diamond rings, earrings and a
heavy chain of Klondike gold, valued at
about $2000.
Mawry and the woman arrived in San
Francisco last Tuesday from Alaska.
While in Dawson the couple were in ill
health, the woman especially complain
ing of severe heart pains, and a short
while ago, deeming it necessary to leave
the country, she disposed of their busi
ness and left for this city.
On the journey Mawry claims to have
had a severe attack of illness, and fear
ing that it might result fatally, turned
over to Miss Antonucci half of his wealth,
that Bhe might have possession of it
should he die.
Â¦When the couple' arrived here last Tues
day they repaired at once to the Cooper
Medical College for examination and yes
terday afternoon they visited that place
for further treatment. After leaving the
college Mawry and the woman went to
Golden Gate Park and rented bicycles to
take a short rid*.
"We had ridden as far as Strawberry
Hill," said Mawry, "but when we got to
the bridge Teresa complained of feeling
badly and dismounted, saying she would
rest awhile. In a few minutes she waa
on her wheel again and we resumed our
ride, but only for a short distance, when
Teresa suddenly screamed and fell from
her wheel to the ground.
"With the assistance "of a gentleman
who was driving by I picked her up. She
was unconscious but alive. We hurried
her as fast as possible In the gentleman's
buggy to the Park Hospital, but found it
closed. Then we drove to the Mount Zlon
Hospital on Sutter street, but when we
reached the place poor Teresa was dead.
I feel certain It Is heart disease, because
she had been complaining ever since she
went to Alaska two years ago."
Mawry claims that for the past twelve
years he and Miss Antonucci have trav
eled together and have been all over the
world. Two years ago they came to San
Francisco on their way to the Klondike
country from Paris. While in Dawson
they conducted a grocery store and Miss
Antonucci played an engagement in the
theater at that place as a ballet dancer.
He also says the woman was a celebrated

"You see," said Ewing, "It was this ;
way: Mrs. Mahoney promised <me that
when I wedded her daughter she would i
set me up in business. She has not only I
disregarded this promise, but has retained
possession of jewels and trinkets belong
ing to my wife, the value of which will ap
proximate $2000. We asked her for them, i
and when she refused we filed suit for
their value. A few days ago I went to her
rooms at 222 Powell street with Policeman
Joy and under authority of a search war
rant tried to find the jewels. Hardly any
thing was recovered, but Mrs. Mahoney
Insulted me several times and once tried j
to strike me.
"She there astonished me by telling me
that my wife is not her daughter at all
and that Marie was taken out of a lying- ;
in hospital when she was only a few da>*3 ;
oldl 1 asked her why she did not tell me j
that prior to the marriage and received
no reply."
Mrs. Ewing said she was glad to dis
cover she was not Mrs. Mahoney's daugh
ter. She says the whole trouble had been j
caused by the Jealousy of the woman she
always believed tq be her mother.
"She . used to caress my husband so
often in my presence I got tired of it and !
once told her to quitâ that I didn't like :
it. She has said I may return and have;
a good home whenever I am willing to re- ;
llnquish my husband, and I have said In '
response that where my husband wen:
there I would be found, and that any i
door closed to him would never be passed Â¦
by me." ......
Mrs. Mahoney evidently dearly loves the i
girl she has always called "daughter." j
and she could not keep the tears from '
flowing as she furnished her version of \
the affair.
"Yes," she said. "It Is true that I took |
Marie out of a lying-in hospital when she j
was only five days old. though she wa*
never adopted. I loved her and sent her !
to the best Institutions of learning In ;
San Francisco, giving her more than a
mother's care and more of this world's I
goods than falls to the lot of most girls. I
Senator Mahoney objected to my keeping f
her. and our engagement came near being
broken by my refusal to yield her up.
"When Ewing came to this city last
year Marie fell In love with him and I
tried to make her cease to think of him j
because I discovered that he was not
worthy of her. I knew he thought a mar-
riage with her would result to his pecu
niary benefit, but her heart was bent on
the marriage and I was forced to coa3ent
In writing, as -I then thought she was
only 17 years old. I have gone to the rec
ords of her baptism since then and Und
that she will be 10 years of age on Marcli
24 next, so she was then 13 years old. Tha
marriage occurred on August 22 last.
"My fears were realized shortly after
the union by iraer coming to me and try
ing to borrow J^uO, which he failed to ob
tain. I paid his bill at the Langham Ho
tel when he left there and gave Maria
the receipt. He has since then admitted
to me that Judgment was rendered
against him on a suit In Minneapolis and
that he has had to keep away from that
city. I was further told that he once had
something to do with the saloon business
in Pittsburg. and this he has also ad
mitted.
"Regarding the jewels, their total valua
would not t>e more than $150. and I am
holding them as security for bill 3 pakl
by me for Ewir.g. I care nothing- for thti
Jewels and would like to see them in Ma
rie's possession, but he has pawned or
sold all the jewelry belonging to her h*
could lay hands on and I know he would
do the same with what I now have. Once,
since the marriage I cave Marie $10 and I
afterward learned she gave it all but a
dollar to her husband. She fairly Idolizes
the man. She toid a friend of mine ha
had 'features like a Greek god and a fore
head like the Savior." My poor little girl,
my heart is breaking to think of the way
she is now being treated. Her husband
never works and takes her fram place to
place, leaving bills unpaid everywhere.
"I hope she will one day see her folly
and return to me. where she will be well
provided for. I love her and will protect
her. but that 'thing'â yes. that Is what I
called him when he had the brazen ef
frontery to come here with a search war
rant â shall never receive a cent from me.
I told Marie the facts of her parentaga
at her expressed wish, as she had heard
something previously, but the caliber of
her husband, who has sworn to protect
her. may be gauged from his making it a
matter of public comment. The talk
about jealousy is too absurd to discuss

BARRY POINTS OUT
MISTAKES OF
PHELAN.
Editor Warns the Mayor
That It Is Time .
to Halt.
DENOUNCES THE CONSPIRACY
Â«
Tells ijie Little despot to
Abandon His Policy of
Rule or Ruin and
Redeem Himself,
mATOR PHELAN has yet a
few hours left before he car
ries out his expressed deter
mination to read to hlmse.lt
his own political death war
rant. In other words, he has
from now till Monday to reconsider his
threat that before that date he would
have ousted Police Commissioner Biggy.
The Call suggests that in the few re
maining hours the Mayor put his ear to
the ground to hear the rumblings of pop
ular discontent at his actions; that he use
his eyes to read the published statements
of men, now estranged from him, who
until his shameless association with con
spirators were his stanchest friends; that
he make an effort to balance his' appar
ently disordered brain so that he may
calmly weigh the warnings of Joseph Brit
ton and Henry N. Clement and Stewart
Menzles and Isldor Gutte. all public-spir
ited citizens, who once believed he was a
man and now admit he Is only a sorry
tool.
Their warnings are pointed. He can read
them on the run. They are given In sor
row and they all convey the hope that he
may profit by breaking off with the Esola
plotters; that he may let his appointed
Commissioners act as free agents, as In
tended In the letter and spirit of the char
ter, and that he may take again to good
courses.
Or, if the Mayor be not convinced by
these warnings and by the rumblings of
popular discontent, let him read the sad
story of his. official vagaries, penned by
another and probably closer friend, James
H. Barry, editor of the Star. Throughout
his political career Mayor Phelan has had
no more consistent supporter than Barry.
Even when the Mayor's order went out to
his henchmen to knife James G. Magulre
at the polls, Barry, dyed-ln-the-wool Ma
gulre man though he was and Is. fought
on with voice and pen for Phelan. Through
thick and thin, in'season and out, he was
for the Mayor, first, last and all the time.
Phelan overstepped his prerogatives when
he ousted a Board of Supervisors, but
Barry was with him; he was still with him
when he knew the little plotter was sac
rificing Magulre. and It seemed as If noth
ing could cause him to desert.
And yet. although it is the eleventh
hour, Barry has hoisted the flag of revolt.
The little Mayor's continued wrongdoing
has turned the heart and the stomach of
James H. Barry, and in yesterday's Issue
of the Star the result is apparent. In an
editorial, marked with reluctance and re
gret, the editor of the Star joins the rap
idly increasing ranks of those who cry to
the Mayor, "Hold! You have gone too
far!" He calls upon him to stop, to turn
back and redeem himself in the eyes of
the people. The editorial in its entirety
here follows:
"FALLEX FROM HIS HIGH ESTATE."
We have yielded to none In our admiration
for Mayor Phelan. We have devoted almost
whole Issues of the Star to his cause, and have
spoken from nearly every platform In the cityâ
sometime* at three or four meetings In a single
eveningâ ln his behalf. All this we did without
reward or hope of reward. We did It from
principle.
When, near the close of the last State cam
paign. Mayor Phelan was shamefully attacked
at a Catholic church fair In Oakland by Peter
C. Yorke. we did not hesitate to speak aloud
with voice and pen In his defense, although we
were conscious of the fact that by so doing we
were Jeopardizing. If not ruining, our chances
for Congress, for which (God forgive us!) we
were then a candidate. We knew that Ig
norance and prejudice would visit their wrath
upon us, and they did.
We have known Mr. Phelan since boyhood
days. As boy and man we have always consid
ered him the eoul of. honorâ true to his friends
and faithful to every trust. As a public official
he was to us an Ideality.
Personally, we are still friends;
bat politically we can no longer be,
unless he chanKes his course, for
since his inauguration for his third
term his method* hare not been
those of a high-minded, broad-fcanffe
statesman, bat the methods of a po
litical "boss."
Such methods we have fought for twenty
years. Shall we, can we consistently. Ignore
them now?
These are the first disparaging words we
have ever written or spoken of Mayor Phelan;
they are printed reluctantly and regretfully.
Primarily, they are prompted by Mayor Phe
lan's attitude- in the matter of Chief of Police,
but there are other things deserving censure,
on which we shall not now dw<*ll.
First of all. let us say that we have no syfn
pathy whatever with John D. Spreckels and
M. H de Youngâ proprietors cf The Call and
the Chronicle respectivelyâ ln their diatribes
against Mayor Phelan. for they are prompted
by base motives. Both of them asked favors
from the Mayor, which were not granted.
Spreckels begged to be appointed Police Com
missioner, agreeing to oppose Phelan. If at all,
only In a negative way. as payment for the
"plum." De Young asked to have a friend, or
relative, placed ,on . one of the commissions.
Both requests were denied. They are fighting
Phelan for the same reason that they -are fight
ing Burnsâ they did not get what they wanted.
The cause for regret is that the Mayor, . by
his course, has furnished them with ample
ammunition for their revengeful attacks.
Andy Lawrence, managing editor of the Ex
aminer, wants one Frederick Esola appointed
Chief of Police. , He and Mayor Phelan have
both practically stated In print that the posi
tion was promised him before the appointment
of the new commissioners, and that the ap
pointments were made with that understand
ing.
If such a promise was made. It was In vio
lation of the new charter and against public
morality; also. In obedience to the will of
Andy Lawrence.
The Examiner Rave the whole
"snap" away in its Issue of last Sat
arJaj. whan it said that Ulsrjrv
Poundkeepers Are Balked.
James Hughes and P. Hughes, Deputy
Poundkeepers, attempted to scoop a set
ter and poodle dog Into their net on Van

morning. The setter showed fight and
during the mlxup the poundmen had their

caped but the poodle was captured. The
poundmen went to the Receiving Hospi

Davis on His Muscle.
There was a lively little scrap near the

Fish and Game Commissioner John Davis
punched the nose of Joe Barbettl. who Is
Interested In the fish business. Davis had
arrested A. Frazzinl for violating one of
the State laws which prohibits the tak

Harbor police station. Barbettl was In no
way interested, but he.stuck his nose Into
the .trouble and expressed his opinion of
Davis, who Is one of the best officers on
the commission. Davis paid no attention
to the fellow until the latter applied a

TALKS OF THE PLAGUE.
Arthur M. Sewall Tells How Hono
lulu Handled the Bubonic.
Scourge. â¢
Arthur. M. Sewall, the distinguished
Maine statesman and millionaire ship
builder, 13 a guest at the Palace, to which
hostelry he went yesterday after being
released from the quarantine to which the
passengers of the Australia were sub
jected.
Mr. Sewall left here on the 25th of last
December on a trip which he expected
would extend to the Orient and down to
Manila. He arrived at Honolulu, how
ever. Just in time to meet the plague., and
as no steamer bound out would receive
any passengers from the infected port,
he was cooped up with the rest until the
departure of the Australia. . when he
seized the opportunity to return to the
United States. Owing to the delay he was
forced to undergo at the islands he has
abandoned his trip to Asia and will return
to his home In the East within the next
few days.
Mr. Sewall speaks In the highest praise
of. the manner In which the people of
promised, both BEFORE and AFTER
his appointment to vote for Esola.
for Chief. That statement proves
that there" was n. compact, to make
Esola Chief j and the further remark
that Uigur had betrayed Mayor Phe
lan proves that the Mayor was a
party to that compact. In considera
tion of services not rendered by the
Examiner and Lawrence.
Here are tfce Examiner's own words:
The man (referring to Commissioner Blggy)
who would desert Mayor Phelan and the new
charter would not scruple to desert an honor
ably ambitious young Police Lieutenant whom
he had promised to help secure the office of
Chief. : k""5 â¢i-"'",-f :
Will some one tell us. If any one
can. how niÃjcy has deserted either
Mayor Phelan' or the new charter
by refusing, to vote for the Exam
iner's) Mr. Esolftf -
Even If Esola were the most competent and
the best of men. the position should not have
been pre-empted to him.
That he is incompetent, and worse, was
proven in the recent Investigation of charges
preferred against him, of which, on a com
promise that he would withdraw as a candi
dlate, he was exonerated; but his own testi
mony everlastingly damned him. He stated,
under oath, .that he did not remember having
met tfce Commissioners and the Mayor in the
latter* 8 office, the day after the commission
was appointed, although only ten days had
elapsed; that he did not "recollect" having
discussed the matter of Chief of Police with
them. Robinson Crusoe Lawrence followed his
man Friday, and testified that he accompanied
Esola to the Mayor's office, on the day speci
fied to let the Commissioners see what kind of
a man he was. They saw, and but two of them
still support him. 1
If Esola told the truth, and did not remem
ber, it Is clear that he Is Incompetent. A man
with so treacherous a memory, would bÂ« most
dangerous as Chief of Police. He Is dangerous
even as a lieutenant, and should be dlsml-sed
from the department, which he Is unfit to serve
in any capacity. If he did not tell the truthâ
which is very certainâ he Is a perjurer and
ought to be an inmate of the same prison of
which he was once a guard.
But, says- the Examiner. Esola. was found
guiltless of, the charges preferred against him.
Suppose he was. Does that maTce htm the man
for the responsible office of Chief of Police,
where rare executU'e ability, skill, tact and a
knowledge of human nature are requisites?
Many an honest man (which Esola Is not) lacka
the qualifications to make a Â»ood Chief of Police
âone of the most Important offices In this or
any other great city.
TU* vicious and unjust attack
Honolulu handled the plague. Ho says
that while the authorities did all that was
expected of them, the matter was taken
Into the hands of the people, who went
to work with their precautions to stamp
out the dread disease in a manner worthy
of the highest cornmenr.atior.. Neither
labor nor expense was spared and as a
consequence the scourge has been placed
under control- and Its spread confined
within the limits of its origin.
The fire that destroyed the Chinese
quarter. Mr. Sewall says, was a blessing,
although It was not Intended that the en
tire section should go up In flames. Of
the fifty-six or more cases that have ap
peared in Honolulu only two have recov
ered. Mr. Sewall says that outside of the
plague the affairs in the islands are In
good shape and that all the people living
ther<Â» are anxiously lookins forward to
the territorial government. The only ones
who prefer that the Islands be ruled as
a colony are those who are foreigners by
birth and who have never been natural
ized.
upon Commissioner nisrcj which Is

his course an Police Commissioner
wonld still be commendable. To
prove Blrst tÂ« be a bad man would
not be to prove Lawrence and Esoln
to be cood ones. As Joseph Brltton
has said in a newspaper Interview,
In the Esola business Mr. niircy has
been manly, true and faithful to the
pnblic interests).
It is not yet too late for Mayor Phelr.n to
withdraw the name of Esola and. by steering
clear of false lights, regain the confidence and
esteem of his fellow citizens. The Star cannot
be with him when wrong, but we will ever
be with him when we think he Is right, as he
always was until, unfortunately, he was clothed
by the new charter with absolute power.
No person will doubt the statement of
Editor Barry that that editorial was pub
lished with regret and reluctance. It is
the warning of a friend. Will Mayor Pile
lan heed it?
to kill herself in Eureka, and that her
actions while living there were far from
being above reproach.
The Detectives' Search.
Detective Cody went out to the dead
girl's home to ask the child these ques
tions. Winnie said Amy had a few days
before her death asked whether she
thought a 32 or 3S caliber pistol was bet
ter to kill oneself with. The child said
said she did not know and that she would
be afraid to shoot herself. Amy then
eaid there would be no pain and. that she
was gx>ing to buy a pistol and kill her
self, as she was tired of living.
The ofheers allowed Poulin to go his
way upon his promise that he would re
port to them to-day at noon in order tnat
he might be subpenaed for the inquent.
Mrs. Dart did not seem excited over the
death cf her daughter, but talked of it in
a calm way.
"I am or the opinion that Amy com
mitted suicide," she said. '"But the fact
that the pistol was not found and other
things do make the case mysterious.
"I always thought that my daughter
was working at the telephone office, never
suspecting that she would deceive me.
Sh~ was M years old the 26th of last
October and went to work for the tele
phone company about a year and a half
ago. During all that time she had but
two gentlemen admirers that I know of.
One of these. Jack Plenalp, is a salesman
for Sherman & Clay in Oakland and was
well known to us all. He came often
to see Amy. The other was Poulin, who
was only at the house once. He spent an
hour and a half here one evening. He
used to meet Amy by appointment down
town, so she told me, outside of her work
ing hours. '-',-,
"Amy came home on Friday of last
week and ar.nounced that she had lost
her position with the telephone company
because of some trouble she had had with
one of the girls. She showed me what
purported to be the letter discharging her.
It was written In a hand that I now be
lieve, after seeing some of his writing,
was Poulin's. She sent this document to
her father in Seattle.
"That day Amy went downtown and we
did not pee anything more of her until
Sunday. My husband said he would give
her a scolding when she came back, but
he sailed that morning ar.d when she
came in I upbraided her. She said she
had boen stopping with 'Pete.' the nick
name of a girl with whom she had worked
ar.d who lived with Mrs. Fallon, the wife
of a Market-street saloon-keeper.
Bought a Pistol.
"During the fore part of the week Amy
answered several advertisements for
work, but did not find anything until
Wednesday, when she told me she had
found a position In a phonograph parlor
on Kearny etreet and was going to see
about it. 'It will be Just my luck,' she
said, 'for it to turn out to be night work!'
She went away that day and I. did not
ccc her again alive.
"I Just learned to-day from my son
Freddy that Amy told him she was going
to buy a pistol. She said she had been
reading In the papers about a man who
had killed himself and asked Freddy
many questions about how he thought
people could best kill themselves with a
pistol.
"Amy was a headstrong girl, but neither
myself nor my husband scolded her to
any great extent. We talked to her often
about her willfulness. She never seemed
to take these matters to heart, but passed
them off with a laugh."
Winifred Murphy the little sister of the
dead girl, said the latter accompanied her
on her way to school Wednesday and
epoke to her on the trip about buying a
revolver and committing suicide. x
R. W. .Merino, a Hayes-street car con
ductor, who lives at CO4 Broderick street
paid yesterday at the Morgue that on
Thursday night about 8:30 o'clock a girl
who he believed was Miss Murphyâ his
opinion being formed from seeing her
body at the Morgueâ got on his car at
Powell street and rode to Baker street
There she got off and ran rapidly into the
panhandle. She was eating candy from a
small bag while running. Merino said the
girl acted as If she was going to meet
some one and was in a hurry to fill the
engagement.
Miss Murphy's former chum, "Pete," is
Miss Nellie Peters, formerly in the employ
of the telephone company. She lives at
1157 Market street with Mrs. Patrick Fal
lon, whose husband conducts a saloon un
derneath at that number. Miss Peters
said that for several weeks Amy had com
plained about the> way her mother had
treated her. x
Poulm took a room-on January 30, at
head. In his opinion the shot that caused
death could have been fired by the person
Detectives Cody and Dillon advance the
theory that the girl pawned her gold
wa i < Â£,, t Â£, buy the P! 3^!- The fact that she
nad $12 20 in her purse does not help carry
this cut, though she may have received
this amount above the price of the
weapon. They, say also the revolver may
have been stolen- by some one of the
crowd that gathered around after the
fcedy was found.
In the girls trunk at her home were
found several letters. There was one
from Poulin arranging a meeting and
two from Plenalp. One of these was a
love letter dated January 25 and the
other a request that she accompany him
to the theater on the night of February 3.
Last Letter of Deceased.
One of the last letters the dead girl
wrote was to Plenalp and dated January
30. It is as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO. 3^ "Â£ "So?

Plenalp said he only knew the girl as a
peasantp easant companion, having met her peo
ple in a business way. He had always
thought her a good girl. He had met
Poulin but twice.

Three Persons Who Figure in a Sensational Bit of Gossip.
SCARCELY six months have passed
away since the marriage of the
beautiful and accomplished Marie
Belle Mahoney to W. Baer Ewing
of New York and yet the prophecy of
Mrs. Delia G. Mahoney that discord and
Borrow would be the result of the union
has already been fulfilled. "When the
pressure of circumstances forced the
widow of the late Senator J. H. Mahoney
to sanction the marraige of her daughter
to Ewing she did not swallow the bitter
pill in silence.
Mrs. Mahoney's foresight Is demon
strated by the fact that her supposed
daughter, for the girl's parentage has
never hitherto been questioned, has be
come almost completely estranged from
the woman she called mother and is now
suing: her for the possession of jewelry
and other trinkets valued at $2000. while
Ewing. himself has threatened to bring
suit for slander against Mrs. Mahoney.
Search warrants and "other legal pro
cesses have been resorted to in the suit
and have brought about many dramatic
situations, but the greatest sensation of
all is yet to be sprung.
Mrs. Ewing. according to the statement
of the woman she has always called
mother, is not only not the daughter of
the deceased Senatorâ something which
Intimate friends of the . family have
known and others suspectedâ neither i 3
she the daughter of Mrs. Mahoney by a
former marriage. Mrs. Mahoney declares
that she took her supposed daughter from
a private lying-in hospitalwhen she was
only five days old, and that her refusal
to give up the little waif caused a tem
porary breach between her and the Sen
ator which threatened to cause their en
gagement to be broken. .
In Justice to Mrs. Mahoney it should be
stated that publicity regarding the birth
of her supposed daughter was not given
by her. but by W. Baer Ewing himself.
Mr. and Mrs. Ewing are at present re
siding at 622 Post street and It was there
that the first statements were made re-

TRIO OF BOLD
FOOTPADS HOLD
UP SALOON MEN
Three daring robbers, Frank Burns,
John Allen and George Reed, were arrest
ed early yesterday morning, while- they
were attempting to hold up a bartender
In the saloon of Jimmy Anthony at Ingle
slde. Burns drew a revolver and placing
it at the drink dispenser's head demanded
what money he had In the till. A man
named Donahue, who happened to be In
the place, rushed out and informed Offi
cers Taylor and Dalton. who arrested the
trio, but not until after a sharp struggle
with Burns for the possession ot the
weapon.
Before going out to Ingleslde the three
men made a similar attempt upon Carl
F. Penther. Baloonkeeper. 44 Eighth
street. Penther called at the City Prison
yesterday, accompanied by Detective
Ryan, and the j three men were brought
out with about half a dozen other pris
oners. Penther promptly Identified
them. He afterward swore to a complaint
against the three men in Judge Mogan's
court, charging them with assault to
commit robbery and they were booked on
the charge.
The three men also appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday morning on the
charge of assault to commit robbery on
Anthony's bartender. They were in
structed by the Judge and the cases were
continued until to-morrow. There is also
a charge of having burglars' tocls in his

SHORT ENDS
RUN WELL AT

consequence many of the small bettors

Curtis & Son's Narcissus, a pronounced
favorite, in a well contested course by a

obtained, and the poolsellers wrote quite
a few tickets on the course.
Another Pasha Kennels favorite proved
a disappointment to the wise ones, Re
cording Angel going down before Mc-
Comb's One Spot, which was well played
at 1 to 3.

grounds this afternoon. The ice was In
fine condition and some very fast time
was made. The principal feature of the
races was the lowering of the two-mile
and three-mile professional records, by
John Nielson of Minneapolis. Nlelson
was in splendid form, and had un easy
â¢ time with Baptle, against whom he was
pitted. He lowered the two-mile profes
sional from 5 minutes 61 seconds to 5 min

world's record of 8 minutes 45 seconds for
three miles by going the distance in 8

held by Nlelson, and to-day's performance
was a wonderful one.

route looked too far for Afamada and too

into the stretch. Several degrees' below

BOY WONDER OF
THE TENDERLOIN
GOT A HOT ONE
Jimmie Bulkjey Was
Too New.
DROVE A GIRL TO TEARS
"Jlmmle" Bulkeley, the boy wonder of
the Tenderloin, has been at it again. Sev
eral months ago he Jumped into promi
nence by his unsuccessful attempt to
make a runaway marriage with a girl In
short clothes, whose sister objected. Next
he turned up in Superior Judge Coffey's
court to remark that $250 a month of the
estate left by his father was not euffl
cient allowance for his butterfly exist
ence. Next he appeared to the astonished
pare along the line arrayed in a checker
board suit trimmed with deep bands of
green velvet. A week or so later a young
lady in the- Grand Opera-house chorus
was suddenly afflicted with blindness.
The very next day, out of sympathy.
Bulkeley announced that his eyes had gone
back on him. He donned immediately a
pair of green goggles and hired a young
fellow to lead him about town.
' His latest outbreak occurred Friday
afternoon in the Stanford photographic
parlors, 821 Market street. A few days
before thÂ« boy wonder had discarded his
rocffles and, looking upon himself in the
xnlrror, found the sight to be good. It im
mediately occurred to him that such
youthful beauty should be perpetuated.
Acting on this belief, he had his face
taken at the Stanford gallery. Friday
afternoon he called to see how the work
was progressing. One of the young lady
attendants was so obliging that "Jimmie"
could not resist the temptation 19 get
"new.". He playfully graobed the 'right
hand of the young lady in his and began
to squeeze. The girl began to squirm,
then to squeal asid finally, young Bulkeley
Btill putting on the pressure, to shriek.
Mr. Thomas, the proprietor of the gal
lery, attracted by the cries of the girl,
hastened to her side. With him went Jul
ian R. Brandon, a well-known athlete and
professor of physical culture. Upon their
MTtval Bulkley let go of the girl's crushed
band, and â¢ made some flippant remark
when asked what he meant. Brandon
told- him he had a good notion to spank
him. Bulkeley and the young man with
him swelled up and made a war talk,
which impressed Brandon only by rea
son of the fact he did not want to quarrel
with them.
A few minutes later Bulkeley and his
companion and Brandon went down the
elevator together. Taking Brandon's
Quietness to indicate cowardice. Bulkeley
made some biting remarks. Still Bran
don paid nothing until they reached the
sidewalk. There Bulkeley. emboldened,
said the one thing he Should not have
paid. The next instant a warm palm *fell
hard on his cheek, his heels flew in the
air. his lank, yellow hair raised on his
head and he bumped the sidewalk. Mr.
Brandon moved on. as the crowd gathered
to see the young wonder of the Tender-
Loin crawl "away nursing a ringing ear
and a sore J.iw. '

movement is made and a petition by the
citizens most concerned got up I think
that something may be accomplished.
Certainly the reputation and prosperity of
the town calls for it."
C. Engelbretsen, another prominent
resident, said:
"I have been a resident of Berkeley for
twenty years and have always been in
favor of all improvements. When I first
moved to Berkeley the railroad company
promised to put a passenger station about
half a mile from Its present freight sta
tion. I have been living in anticipation of
that station ever since and have also been
walking my mile regularly every day. The
attitude the railroad has taken toward
the residents of Berkeley and has always
maintained is. an outrage. The prosperity
of the town has been checked and 1U
growth Injured. A relative of mine who
is employed by the Giant Powder Works
has had to move hi 3 family from Berke
ley that he might be nearer his work, a
distance of but a few miles."
George Schmidt, a real estate man. said
"If we can get a competing line into
Berkeley, either electric or otherwise,
things are sure to boom. As it is the
Southern Pacific has everything in its own
hands and dictates matters as it sees
best. That best la very poor. The rail
road has good accommodations as far as
its local trains go, but its main line serv
ice that would benefit Berkeley materially
is very inadequate. By making Berkeley
a stopping place it will be well advertised
and a larger working class will be drawn
hither."
Sam Heywood, who owns considerable
property In West Berkeley, said:
"if- the railroad would make Berkeley
a regular passenger station I think busi
ness here would be greatly benefited. I
know that the value of real estate would
be greatly enhanced. The service as It is
at present is very Inadequate and pre
vents many people from making Berkeley
their home. Those who come here from
the East with their families and look
around for a location pass by this place
just because the railway service is poor.
If the railroad is determined not to stop
its regular main line trains here I wish
it would find other means by which the
workingmen employed north of here may
be accommodated.
D. H. Brans, a prominent grocer, said:
"I believe the Southern Pacific will be
forced before long to make some arrange
ment whereby the citizens of this place
who are employed north of here will bo
accommodated. If their regular passen
ger trains cannot be stopped at Berkeley
some other means should be provided,
think the railroad people have been con
'templatlng for some time the advisability
of running a branch electric line to Berke
ley and north. For its own sake I should
think some new and quick service should
be inaugurated at once."
Otto Nlehaus. who owns one of the
largest planing mills in this vicinity, said:
"I would like to see some arrangement
made that would have Berkeley made a
stopping place. Nothing like that has
ever been satisfactorily done in this com
munity. About five years ago the Mar
tinez local used to stop at Berkeley at
9:30 o'clock in the morning. That was
kept up for only a few months, when it
was discontinued. The hour was too late
for the worklngmen. and consequently
was not a paying proposition to the rail
road. The same matter has been advo
cated so often In Town Trustee meetings
and by clubs that the railroad people be
came antagonized and would not devote
any attention to us. If Berkeley can he
made a stopping place I know that con
ditions in general will be better."
George D. Metcalf aa!d
"I think. Berkeley ought to be treated
by the railroad as well as Its prosperity
and location demands. It certainly is an
Inconvenience to the people of thia place
to have poor train service. Something
should bÂ» done to accommodate the men
who have to go north for* their work.
Some arrangement should be* made and
made immediately to better railway tran
sit and not handicap the town in Its de
velopment." -' â¢ : Â¦Â¦ -'
mISS OLIVE WHITE, a frail
young miss of 16 years, re-
Biding with her mother at
963 Twenty - sixth avenue,
East Oakland, had a desperate en
counter with two masked burglars in
her bedroom, at 2:30 o'clock yesterday
morning. She grappled with one of
them and was creating havoc with
her finger-nails on the skin of hia face
and neck when the other robber came
to the rescue of his pal. The pair
choked the plucky girl into a semi
conscious condition and then wrapped
a coverlet around â¢ her head, stuffing
a portion of it In her mouth to pre
vent her from screaming. They tied
the coverlet Into an intricate knot,
after which they hurriedly escaped
through the window, which afforded
them an entrance. The police were
notified, but all the officers did was to
make an effort to squelch the story.
The young lady, fragile as she is,
did not faint. Instead, as soon as her
assailants fled, she tore the coverlnET
from her head and vociferously
screamed for aid. A young man who
was sleeping in the house at the time
responded, but failed to follow tho
murderous burglars. Miss White Is
now suffering from nervous prostra
tion.
"I noticed two fellows lurking about
the house,-" said Miss White this af
ternoon. "That was Thursday evening
about supper time. A couple of hours
later they were there again, and I be
came alarmed. Papa Is dead and
there arc no men folks in the house,
so we decided to ask a friend of the
family to sleep on the premises. He
did so, but I was still scared and
could not sleep. Finally I got up and,
collecting all my Jewelry and a num
ber of keepsakes which belonged to a
Bister who died a year ago, put
them in a shoe. Then I placed the
things under the bed and retired
again. I lay and shivered until about
1 o'clock, when I fell off Into an un
quiet sleep.
"The next thing I knew I was wide
awake and saw two men moving
about. They rifled the drawers of the
drosser without finding anything, and
then one of them slipped his hand
under my pillow. I was afraid he was
going to chloroform me and I got
so scared that I scarcely breathed.
When he withdrew his hand he ut
tered an almost inaudible oath and
the pair started for the door leading
into the hallway. One of them sud
denly changed his mind and, coming
back, stooped down and started to
grope about with his hands under the
bed.
"This was too much. Mementos of
my dear dead sister were in danger.
I leaped to the floor and grappled
him around the neck. Then I tore the
mask from his face and commenced to
use my flnger-nalls. He started to
fight me and curse. The next instant
his partner had me by the throat and
choked me. Then they shoved a part
of the bed coverlet into my mouth and
twisted the rest around my head and
neck, after which they jumped out of
the window and fled. As soon as I
could free myself from the covering
I screamed. Mamma, grandma and
the gentleman who was staying at the
house came quickly, but he decided
that it was no use to follow.
"The next dayâ that was yesterday
âthe police were notified. An old fel
lov.' who said he was a detective camo
up and said, after hearing my etory,
that I had a nightmare, but I have
pot a piece of the man's tie to show
that It was no dream."
Chief Hodgklns said that he had
heard nothing of the case and did not
know who the wise sleuth was. Be
sides the mask, the young lady se
cured a piece of a red necktie belong
ing to one of the burglars. She also
bears several bruises and scratches as
a result of the encounter.
According to an eminent scientist, the
alkali In asparagus develops form In the
human brain.

ALL BUT RAZORS DRAWN
IN THE LIMEKILN CLUB
JACK DEMPSEY Is a new gentleman of co^pr who blew into town yesterday
and before evening he remarked' in tHe City Prison, on the wrong side of .
the grating, that he felt second-handed and made over after a misfit
pattern. About an hour after his arrival In town he made the acquaint
ance of a member of the Limekiln Club at 23 Stockton street, and after much
assumed coyness consented to be escorted thither and introduced to the
gentlemen who constitute themselves a committee of reception to all new
coons. ;
Mr. Dempsey took a hand In a club game of poker with a party of three,
and played in extraordinarily good luck for a stranger. The club became at :
once suspicious. So the members glued their lamps upon Jack Dempsey, with
the result that they caught him with three aces up his sleeve. The discovery '
was the signal for the "rough house act." They piled in on the stranger Â¦
and he . fought back. Chairs and cuspidors crashed- about the room and '
through the windows and the coal oil heater was upset, setting the place on !
flre. Smoke poured through the windows, while the indomitable Dempsey
lay sprawling on top of the billiard table chewing the black ear of Mr. Julian !
Dennis and the other members were piling down stairs yelling "lire."
An alarm was turned In from box 98 and Chief Sullivan and the '
entire Fire Department were on the- scene. The flames and the squirming <
players were put out simultaneously. Dempsey was hauled off to the City
Prison on a charge of disturbing the peace and the defrauded members of the Â«
poker game have sworn the highbinders' oath against him. 1 ?

it does not undertake to deal with the
future as expressed by the aspect of the
planets, and for that reason cannot give
an opinion of the possible outcome of the
war in the Transvaal as laid down in the
chart by Zadklel in his almanac for the

POLLTAX-A Subscriber. City. The
fact that a man between the ages of II
and 60 Is a Federal employe does not ex
empt him from the payment of State poll
tax. Neither Congress nor the State Leg
islature has the power to pass an act ex
empting such from that taxation. It is a
constitutional provision that "every male
inhabitant of this State over 21 years of
age and under 60 years of age, except
paupers, idiots, insane nersons and â¢ In
dians not taxed, shall pay an annual poll
tax of not less than $2." Such tax Is paid
into the State school, fund.
MINORS AND CONTRACTSâ C. C,
Watsonville, Cal. Tha law of this State
Bays on the subject of minors and con
tracts: "A minor cannot give delegation
of power nor under the age of 13 make a
contract relating to real property or any
interest therein or relating to any person
al property not in his or her Immediate
possession or control."
"A minor may make a contract other
than that specified in the same manner as
an adult, subject only to disafflrmanca
under this title and subject to provisions
of title of this code on 'Marriage and Mas
ter and Servant.' "
THE OCEAN LEVELâ An Old Farmer.
Mount Eden, Cal. There Is no difference
in the mean level of the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans. The Idea that one is higher
than the other has no doubt arisen from
a statement published a number of years
ago to the effect that the ocean level was
higher at Colon, on the Atlantic side of
the proposed Panama canal, than at Pan
ama, on the Pacific side. That statement
was not correct and must have been the
result of insufficient observations or per
haps the party who gave the information
to the writer of that article was misun
derstood. It is probable that the state
ment that was made was in regard to
high and low tides. There Is very little
range of tide at Colon â not more than
eighteen or twenty inches. At Panama
the range of spring tide is from eighteen
to twenty-two feet. The neap tide Is from
six to ten feet.
HIS IDEAâ D. J.. City. Thia corre
spondent presents another phase of the
century question. He writes: "I find in
studying chronology that Chri3t was born
four years before the commencement of
what is called the Christian era or the
year of our Lord; In other words, four
years B. C. Therefore the only question
is not whether this is the beginning of
the twentieth or end of the nineteenth
century, but whether we are three, four
or five years in the twentieth century and
whether this should not be 1904. Whether
the 4 B. C. began or ended at the. begin
ning or end of a year I know not. but
one thing Is clear â the number ought to bo
1904. Refer to chronology in the Encyclo
pedia Britannlca or any Biblical chronol
ogy." If the correspondent feels that he
Is living In an advanced age and ought
to write 1904 this department does not
know of any reason why h* should not
do so. but the majority of people will be
content to writs 1900 until the close of the
year.
INDEBTEDNESS OF THE
CONTRA COSTA COMPANY
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â The certificate of

EVENTS AT THE

OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â The new stock
company at the Macdonough Theater has
closed Its first week successfully. The

and there has been a steady growth of
business. The play for the coming week

such a hit In New York.
The Dewey Theater has done well with
"Uncle Bob." The play for this week will
be "The Wyoming Mail."

RAN AWAY TO MARRY,
NOW WANTS A DIVORCE
OAKLAND. Feb. 3.â The sequel to the
sensational elopement of Belle Haswell
and Percy Bromwell two years ago was
furnished late this afternoon when the
young lady filed an application for divorce
from her dilettante husband. She de
clares that he has failed to provide her
with the necessaries of life for a long
time, and last July brought their marital
woes to a climax by deserting her.
Previous to her marriage the complain
ant was a stenographer for Dr. Mayon,
chief medical examiner for the Ancient
Order of United Workmen on the Pacific,
Coast.
The defendant is a son of L. L. Brom
well and was formerly a member of Oak
land swelldom. The couple were secretly
made husband and wife at San Rafael,
and when the affair became known" it
created gossip which lasted for several
weeks.

whenever and wherever he chooses.
EXPECTANCY OF LIFEâ S., City. By
a very simple rule a person can at any
time ascertain the number of years that
he or she has still to live. The result is
not absolutely correct, but it is what the
actuarial tables give. Let the individual
deduct the present age from 80 and two
thirds of the remainder is the expectancy
of life. -.';/
NO NEED TO SALUTEâ G. N., Mare
Island. If a man is honorably discharged
at a military post at expiration of term
of service and on leaving the post he
should meet an officer and not salute him

ject to military discipline.
DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMYâ G.
N., Mare Island, Cal. An enlisted man
dlshororably discharged from the United

small structures on the site.
FOREIGN POSTMASTERSâ D. C. C. C.
Oakland, Cal. This department is unable
to obtain the names of the postmasters
at Malta, Candia, Virgin and Guam, for
the reason that the postal authorities
here have them not. There is no doubt
that if you should send to each of
these a sum of money to pay for unused
postage stamps of each place that the
stamps will be forwarded, but if you are
in any way suspicious and afraid to take
the risk do net send the money.

FRIENDLESS OLD WOMAN
KILLED BY AN ENGINE
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â The old woman
who was killed by the light engine at 1
o'clock this morning was to-day identified
as Man* Brown, who has been living in
poverty at the foot of Broadway for some
years.
The old woman has been cared for by
those who had none too much of this
world's goods, and seems to have had no
relatives that can be found. She was ut
terly destitute and will be burled by the
county.
Why she was wandering around in the
unfrequented neighborhood where she was
killed is not known. The light engine tvrs
traveling at a high rate of speed, for the
track at this point runs over a marsh

BERKELEY, Feb. Iâ The Southern
Pacific Company has left Berkeley
off the railroad map. The Ken
tucky corporation uses the college
town only as the terminus of Its local
trains and, to the disgust of the merchants
and the Injury of the town, none of the
main line and overland passenger trains
stop here, even though the main line of
the company runs through "West Berkeley.
When a Berkeley man now wishes to go
to any. point on the main lines of the
Southern Pacific Company he is first com
pelled to go to Oakland, for the railroad
map shows Berkeley as a freight station
only. There is a local train to East Berke
ley, which is the college town proper,
and another to West Berkeley; but they
only accommodate those citizens who
have business in San Francisco, Oakland
or- Alameda. Those who are employed
north of Berkeley along the line to Pinole
or who wish to reach interior points must
travel by the Southern Pacific circuitous
local route. A man whose work calls him
to Highland station, a distance of one
mile, from Berkeley, must either walk or
take the local train to the Sixteenth-street
station, Oakland, wait for the northbound
Sacramento local and ride to his destina
tion. That will consume at least an hour
of his time, whereas if the trains stopped
at Berkeley the trip could easily be made
In a few minutes.
The business men of Berkeley have con
tended that although the business and
population of the town have grown. If thÂ«
railroad had done -its share things would
be to-day in vastly better shape. For
years an electric railway connecting East
to West Berkeley has beeii advocated by
the local improvement clubs. Tha only
means of travel between the two places
now Is by a one-track horsecar line, which
requires half an hour for the trip. Had a
stopping place been prdvided by the rail
way monopoly private means would un
doubtedly have been secured to build
a modern street railway and real estate
would have been benefited as well as the
community at large. As it Is, nothing
has been ridne by the railroad that would
make Berkeley more than a sidetrack and
the town has been greatly Injured in con
sequence.
C. D. Maloney, Superintendent of
Streets, a former Trustee and resident of
Berkeley for twenty-two years, has this
to say about the station question:
"Twenty years ago the Southern Pa
cific Company promised to make
Berkeley one of its regular stopping
places. It has continued to promise ever
since, but has done nothing material. It's
a shame to people of this town should be
thus treated. There are stations between
here and Sacramento not as large s a.s a
small waiting-room at which trains stop,
whether there are passengers to get on or
not, but when trains come to Berkeley
they seem to put on more steam to hurry
past, fearing, I believe, some accident
that will compel them to stop.
"There are about ten thousand people
affected by the railroad's miserly treat
ment. In fact, the whole of Berkeley is
more or less concerned in the matter.
Many men would use the train if it
stopped at Berkeley. A large number are
employed by the Giant Powder Company
and other companies north of the town
who must either get up at daybreak or
live near their work. Some have families
living in Berkeley whom they do no see
oftener than once a week. It's a hardship
on them and a handicap to the town. I
know of a young man who is employed
at So Brant, which is about ten or eleven
miles north of this place. In order to get
to his work he must either hire a horse or
take the down train to the mole, catch
the early morning Sacramento local and
ride to So Brant. That means a loss of
time of at least an hour and a half. His
salary as well as his body suffers. I think
it's about time some very radical changes
should be made, and if a concentrated
FIREMAN'S FUND WINS
FROM COLLEGE TEAM
BERKELEY, Feb. 3.â The first regular
game of baseball of the eeason in Berke
ley was played this afternoon on the col
lege campus between the Fireman's Fund
and the University of California. The
game, although not particularly exciting,
was interesting for several reasons. The
Fireman's Fund team lined up against
Stanford last Saturday and defeated them
by a score of S to 2. To-day they defeated
California 7 to 4.
The play of the collegians was ragged
in several places, but on the whole a very
creditable game was played. The game
put up by the insurance men was as it al
ways is â good.
George Van Haltren, who has been en
gaged to coach the college men. umpired
the game and watched the weak spots in
the team. The play of the men, he said,
was fairly good, but there was no team
work. He will take the equad in hand next
Monday and in a couple of weeks should
work out a very good team. He will have
several weeks to coach the men in the
finer points of the game before they go
into the intercollegiate contest with gtan
ford.
The teams lined up as follows:
Fireman's Fund â Sehmeer. shortstop; N. Ham
mond, catcher; Kru?. pitcher and left field:
Follansbe*. first base; Webber, second base;
Bankhead, pitcher and left field; Butler, right

Hunter, shortstop; Hamlln: llrst base; Fuller,

YOUNG GIRL BATTLES WITH
TWO DESPERATE BURGLARS
SHE LIVED ON
CONVERSATION
LONG ENOUGH
Mrs. Lulu Robbins to
Have a Home.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 3.
Leigh H. Robbins has decided to aban
don his life of wedded bliss by wire and
has decided to take his wife, formerly
Miss Lulu Noe, unto himself. The couple
are now looking for a house and will set
tle down to closer family relations than
have existed for the last two years.
This is the little couple who married
fully two years ago so secretly that no
one knew it, not even their parent*, un
til it was announced in The Call last
week. They conducted their honeymoon
over the telephone and Mrs. Robbins was
called Miss Noe and received an occasion
al call from her husband. Just as if they
were the most ordinary acquaintances.
When the wedding became public Cral
gie Sharp, the stepfather of the bride, de T
manded that the young man acknowledge
his bride and take her to a home of his
own. Mr. Sharp intimated that the little
bride had "lived on conversation long
enough" and that kisses by wire, while
they might sound well in a ragtime song,
were not particularly conducive to a hap
py matrimonial existence.
A few remarks about a public divorce
resulting from a secret marriage settled
the question and the young couple will go
to housekeeping.

BETTER WATER
DEMANDED OF
THE MONOPOLY
Monthly Analysis by
the Chemist.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Feb. 3.
Councilman Cuvellier will Introduce a
resolution at to-morrow night's meeting
of the Council directing the city chemist
to make an* analysis of the water supplied
by the Contra Costa Company every
month. He also wants the test to be
made honestly, and for that reason will
ask that the city chemist be notified that
lie is paid by tne city. The Councilman
thir.kE that if a report showing the con
dition of the city's water supply is pub
lished every thirty days the water mo
nopoly will be more vigorous in its en
deavor to keep the dead ends of pipes and
nmins properly flushed. Under existing
circumstances great negligence has been
shown by the company and the condition
of the water has beÂ«n"at times so bad as
to create considerable sickness.
"A month ago the water supplied t&
ratror.s in some parts of the city was fo
'<nd that it nauseated a person to drink
it." said Councilman Cuvellier. "The
Contra Costa people charp** a high enough
rate, and there is no excuse for such a
condition of affairs."
The other Councilmen are mostly in
favor of the scheme and It will undoubt
edly pass.

MITCHELL J. MEYERS, With Fidelity Lodge F. and A. M.
FOR a quarter of a century with
out Interruption, and not absent
more than three or four nights
in that period, Mitchell J. Mey
ers stood guard as tyler at. the outer
portal of Fidelity Lodge No. 120. Free
and Accepted Masons, and so well and
faithfully did he discharge the duties
of that very responsible position that
the membership of his lodge decided
to show its appreciation of his ser
vices. It concluded that its mark of
appreciation should be a testimonial In
the shape of a gold watch, appro
priately Inscribed, to be presented to
him at a meeting of the lodge on the
night of the Ist inst.. to be followed
by a supper, at which he should be
the guest of honor, but the plans c-f
the lodge were upset by the fact that
Mr. Meyers was taken suddenly 111
about two weeks ago and has been
confined to his home, 1911 Bush street,
ever since.
At the last held stated meeting of
the lodge It was decided that there
should be an informal presentation of
the handsome testimonial in the sick
chamber, and for that purpose Rev.
Jacob Voorsanger and Past Masters
H. S. Manheim and Max Goldman
were appointed a committee to make
the presentation. This was done yes
terday afternoon, the committee be
ing accompanied by O. T. Barnett, the
worshipful master, Past Master Rob
ert Day and Dr. H. H. Hart. The
presentation on behalf of the lodge
being by the Rev. Dr. Voorsancer,
who In an eloquent and touching man
ner expressed the lodge's high appre
ciation of the faithful tyler's services,
expressed the regret of the *ntli - e
membership that It could not be pres
ent to give personal congratulations
upon the completion of so long a term
of service, and uttered the hope of
every member of Fidelity Lodge that
He who watched over the sick, as over
the well, will give the patient strengtn
to return to the station he has so hon
orably filled for so many years.
Mr. Meyers, from whom thin move
ment on the part of his lodge had been
kept a profound secret, was surprised
beyond expression, but he was too
weak to make any extended remarks,
such as he felt the occasion called for,
but the expression on his features con
veyed more fully than the choicest
language could express the feeling
that possessed him on receiving the
beautiful and valuable expression of
his f raters' appreciation of his ser-
There Is no man in San Francisco in
the large circle of his acquaintances
who Is .better known and commands
higher respect than Mitchell J. Mey
ers. In the Masonic fraternity he has
the confidence of every one who nn%
had the pleasure of his acquaintance,
for all have admired his falthfulnoss
and his Integrity. He has had the offer
of honors In the lodge, but he declined
all. believing that there is no greater
honor than to stand at the outer door
to guard the secrecy of the lodge and t
see that no one not entitled shall t^o
beyond the anteroom, for the office
Is one of the most responsible below
that of worshipful master. Since 1559
he has been a member of Fidelity
Lodge, which that year he joined by
affiliation, and the long service at the
outer door Is proof that he adopted as
the motto of his life the name of the
lodge. Not only has fidelity been the
motto of his fraternal life, but he has
demonstrated that in all his business
transactions and dealings with men.
He is one of the old-timers In San
Francisco and was In the early days a
volunteer fireman, being a member of
San Francisco Hook and Ladder Com
pany No. 1. of which Charley Scnultz.
the old-time leader of the California,
was the foreman. He was also for
many years a member of the National
Guard of this State, with the rank of
corporal. Like the late Louis R. Town
send, who at the time of his death
was the ranking National Guardsman
of California In point of continuous
service, he declined any higher rank
than corporal, saying that two stripes
suited his ambition. Since the death
of Townsend he has teen the ranking
guardsman In service. While It Is
true that he did not aspire to gold
braid and shoulder straps, he was Â»n
active worker when In the ranks, and
his pride was to bring the several or
ganizations with which he was con
nected to a high standard. It was he
who* started the association known ns
the Veterans of the National Guard,
and he was also interested in the
formation of the Masonic Vet
erans' Association. He also holds
membership in the Veteran Firemen's
Association. In the National Guard
he Is known far and wide as "Corporal
Meyers," In the Masonic fraternity no
one addresses him except as "Papa
Meyers" and in the Firemen's Asso
ciation It is "Old. Pop Meyers," and he
Is proud of each of these names.
Mr. Meyers, who Is now In his e ixty
fifth year, is possessed of a most won
derful memory for faces and names.
He can recall the names of all the
members of his lodge, even though
some, by reason of absence from the
State, for a long time have not vlMted
the lodgeroom, and his power of loca
tion of time and Incidents has won the
admiration of many who have ex
pressed the wish that they had ai
good a memory as "Papa Meyers." In
the ea/ly days he was the leading
merchant tailor In the line of military
uniforms, and he has as his record the
fact that he made more uniforms to
measure for National Guardsmen and
officers than any other man In Cali
fornia.
His many friends outside of the Ma
sonic order which yesterday honored
him will all be pleased when they
learn that he has fully recovered from
his present illness.

. CHICAGO, Feb. B.â The serenity ot the wheat
pit was not disturbed throughout : the session
by any thins startling. Early newsâ Liverpool
and Paris, both lower, and' the export de
mand tameâ was disappointing to the bulls.
"May opening %c under yesterday at 68HÂ®68Jio.
Traders sold and -the price quickly j receded to
6S@6SHc This was followed by a reaction,
which gradually worked May to' 68H0. That
foreigners In the face of lower cables were
buyers here was regarded as significant. Ap
prehension over the extent of the damage done
the French crop was felt and many were un
easy over the condition of domestlo fields after
the cold snap. The visible was exDected to
decrease nearly 1,000,000 bushels. There was
some cash business done and the strength of
corn was Inspiring. The result of this array
of information was that early short sellers
were compelled to buy back . early lines at an
advance In price. The market closed firm.
May only Ho under yesterday at 6SttÂ®6B^c.
From early easiness. Induced by laree re
ceipts and the sympathy with the- opening de
cline In wheat, the corn market turned strong
and held its gains. , Small country > offerings
and a report that the Argentine orop had suf
fered for want of moisture were the chief
factors. May closed Ho to Ma up. at 83&033ttP.

THE GOLDEN BOOT.
It Has Very Nearly Disappeared From
in Front of the Shoemaker's Shop.
Tha familiar sign of the golden boot, by
which generations of tha human rac-j hava
been guided to stores where footwear was
sold and where repairs could ba made. Is
rapidly disappearing. Occasionally we sea
ona on which time has stamped tha FJgn
of age. Its gilt has been dimmed .and it
no longer Invites ua to the shop, unless It
be to have some repair made, and not
then, as a rule, unless tha ownw of the
dilapidated shoa wants the work done for
a trifle. The golden boot once marked
the ?lcj. of the man who caierol lv th >
wealthy customers, w"hile ha who con
ducted a boot and shoe "hospital" waa
an aristocrat if he could hang out a small
gilded shoe. The humbler members of tho
profession had to be content with a paint
ed emblem.
Just when the golden boot waa first
made use of as a sign none can tell, but it
must have been such for hundreds of
years. "The Tipsy Cobbler" of London
early in the seventeenth century nuns his

stocks largely from Western sources persisted
to the end of the week. The larger part of
the offerings were Etlll conducted by profes
sional speculators. Prices have plainly been
subjected to manipulation by operators long of
stocks, with the object of Inviting renewed out
elds buying. The ease with which prices ad
vanced shows how nearly denuded the market
had become of a floating supply of stocks. The
higher level of prices brought out increased
offerings, showing that a considerable volume
of stocks is overhanging the market. Railroad
stocks have moved upward, but not as widely
as the Industrials and the volume of dealings
In them has been much smaller.

be said to mark a distinct Increase of confidence

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. B^-Speculatioo la to-day* i
chort session of the stock market was swayed
by long vestures, encouraged by the statement
of the St. Paul Railroad for the fourth week
!n January a&d a disposition to take profits. A
level of prices had beea early established which
indicated a rise on securities pur
chased earlier In the week. The tendency to
realize was very manifest after the publica
tion of an exceptionally favorable bank state
ment.
Aitaoagb the downward movement assumed
some foroe near the end. owing to a violent
break or 2*-Â» Is Sugar, the early advances gain
ed by the St. Paul's showing and that of minor
reads, was not entirely canceled. Interest was
revived to a marked extent In a number of the
Iron and steel issues. National Steel moving
up 2 points and receding fractionally. Tennes
see Coal fell isto comparative dullness and al
though it covered a rang* of 3 points, ter
minated exchanged. Some comment was ex
cited by a rise of five points in General Elec
tric, trtich was generally attributed to reports
of encouraging earnings. Sugar's plunge
downward was ascribed to gossip concerning
the trade war. Third avenue occupied a more
conspicuous position In the market than of
late a&d moved in somewhat narrow limits.
A tendency to cover in some directions, coupled
with free selling In spots, caused a very ir
regular close to the day's business. Transac
tions were unueually heavy for a short day and
the number of stocks dealt la almost equaled
tnat of yesterday.
Whatever may have been the Incubus that
rested upon the stock market the last
few weeks, it was quite effectively lifted dur
ing the preeent week. Dealings have averaged
nÂ«-ariy half a million shares of stocks a day
and oa one day ran up to three-quarters of a
million chares. The earlier repressive Influ
ence was not the military situation in South
Africa, tor the symptoms of indifference to
that, which were indicated last week, were em
phasized on Monday when the London stock
xnaj-Ket was m a seml-paaic and the local
market, though still dull near to stagnation.
was distinctly strong. As for the money mar
ket outlook, the conditions have been no easier
than during the recent period of neglect, and
ihÂ« course of the foreign exchange market and
operation* with the sub-treasury have given
Intimations of a renewed drain on the New
York money rupply. But whatever the cause
of thÂ« previous .<3u!lnÂ»ea the most Influential
factor In arousing the market from Its lethargy
waa unquestionably the action at the annual
raceti&g of the American Steel and Wire Com
pany. The setting aside of a full year's divi
dends of the common stock at the rate of 7
j>r cent to be paid quarterly, was not more
than had b^en foretold in some of the numer
ous rumors that had been disseminated In vain
attempts to awaken speculative Interest In the
etock. But the publication of a balance sheet,
certified to by chartered accountant, was an
answer to much skepticism that has assailed
this company and from the same causes the
whole group of Industrial stocks. Mystery has
been the main characteristic of the industrial
corporations. The amount and nature cf
*j k< :s cf obligations, or earnings, of expenses
all these were sealed from the knowledge of the
public and of the average operator in the se
curities The statement as published by the
rteÂ«l and wire company did cot answer all the
questions which investors would want to know,
but it Â«rved to dissipate some of the suspi
cions which have hung around the iron and
eteel stocks. The resulting rebound was oor
rrnioadingly resilient, owing to the extreme
depression from which they have suffered. This
o>prt*slon was due to liberal promises regard
ing dividends and very moderate performance
thus far. A legal obstacle developed last year
to the payment of dividends on the common
stork of corporations before the full years
dividends on the preferred had been alsbur6Â«l.
Uut the non-forthcoming of the dUldends had
nevertheless excited tusplcion and distrust.
The pÂ«rÂ«iÂ«tewe of these sentiments made the
beers very bold and when eteel and wire shot
upward early la the week and other metal
stocks followed la ejrmpathy. - a heavyehort
interest was caught. The bears endeavored to
recoup their losses by some reckless plunging
on the bull side. The market. In consequeno^
was feverish and uneven and inclined to > be

NEW YORK. Feb. 8. â The Financier
says: Despite the heavy demands made
upon the cash holding's of the Clearing
house banks of New York City by the
expanding loan and deposit items the re
serve continues to grow. Btandlng at the close
of business Saturday at $30,871,875. The increase
in deposits was $15,391,200, necessitating the set
ting aside of $3.547,500 additional reserve, but
as the cash during the week was $5,441,100 this
extra demand was not only met, but $593,300
was added to the excess reserve. The expan
sion In deposits was larger than the ordinary
operations of the week called for, but as two
thirds of the entire amount was by the Na
tional City Bank, which also reported $5,000,000
increase In loans and about $3,600,000 in specie,
the statement assumes a special character. The
bank has received a great deal of money of late
In connection with Its Increase of capital to
810,000,000.
The revival of Interest in Stock Exchange
circles and a larger volume of commercial paper
offering has also served to swell the loan ac
count. The loans of the Clearing-house bank 3
now stand approximately at $700,000,000 and de
posits have Increased to $794,000,000. The fact
that receipts of cash are more than sufficient
to meet these heavy advances seems to fore
shadow continued easy money conditions, but
as the treasury has given notice that here
after Internal revenue collections are to bo
cared for by the Government the question of
future receipts assumes a new interest. The
banks have received within the past month
very large additions from Interior remittances,
but these found their Inspiration, In cart at
least, in the liberality of the treasury with
reference to depository banks. If the Govern
ment has placed with these banks all the money
that It feels called upon to contribute the in
flow of money - must slacken perceptibly. In
other words, the operations ot the banks from
now on will be the result of natural business
conditions. It Is perhaps true that in this
case the Interior receipts will slacken and that
the New York lnntitutions will not be able to
go on adding heavily to their outstanding com
mitments without infringing upon the present
surplus. Nothing definite can be said on thU
phase of the outlook, but It should be borne In
mind as having an Important bearing on the
market.

Only threo building contracts wero
filed during the week. Wells, Fargo &
Co. contracted with Richardson & Gale
for additions and alterations, to cost
$7150, to stable buildings on the south
east line of Folsom street, 137:6 feet
southwest of Second street; Laura M.
Taylor with L. J. Dwyer, for painting and
graining, to co3t $1750. on buildings on tho
north line of Washington street. 60 feet
east of Polk street; Cora L. Floyd estate
with R. P. Hurlburt. for repairs, etc.. to
cost $1450, to building at 221 Sansome
street. = ; â¢Â¦Â¦?
For the month of January. 1900, seven
ty-four building contracts, Â¦ valued at
$3C9,351, were recorded, against twenty
four contracts, valued at $219,743. for Jan
uary. 1599, and thirty-two contracts, val
ued at $158.423. for January, IS9S. The
Building News and Review says that 1900
has commenced with a good showing as
far as building interests are concerned.
There is more work in prospect at thÂ©
opening of the year than there has been
for any one year since IS9O.
A noticeable change has taken placo
among the wholesale houses whoso dusl-
ness Is principally tha furnishing of sup
frtiea for tho building Interests. Firms
Ike Miller, Sloas & Scott, Mon
tague & Co., Dunham, Carrtgan
& Hayden ! Company, etc., will not
sell goods any more at retail. They
are tired of filing Hens, and In the future
do not Intend to have business with any
one unless the same is entirely consistent
with wholesale trade. This Is no more
than Just to retailers, who for many
years bavej claimed that their trade was
being ruined by wholesalers selling goods
to any one, at prices considerably lower
that retailers could afford. This is di
rectly attributable to tho advent of good
times. When times are dull any firm
feels Justified In selling goods to any one
who comes along. When times are good
sales are only made to legitimate dealers.
The number of mechanics" Hens filed
In this city during January, 1900, was six
ty-eight, of the total value of $11,723.
against thirty-six, valued at $10,932. for
January. 1899. The releases of these liens
in January, 1900, wero five, valued at
$IGSO. against nineteen, valued at $6014,
for January. ISO 9.
But few people want the things that arÂ«
to bo had for tho asking.
