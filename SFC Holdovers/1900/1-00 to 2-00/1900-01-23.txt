"The Boers admit twenty-one casualties
during General Lyttelton's skirmish on

very slow progress, as the Boers are
numerous and strongly Intrenched. Our

VANCOUVER. B. C, Jan. 22.âApplica

MAYOR PHELAN has attempted
to break another of his pre
election promises, and has only
been prevented from doing so by
reason of the fact that his own
Board of Supervisors, disgusted with his
actions, has refused to be a party to his I
double dealing. Recent developments
have proved conclusively that Phelan re- j
celved many votes on creditâ in other
words, on promise of reward in the way
of patronage or favors in the event of
his election. Many of those who were
induced by his seductive speech to trust
in him have given up hope of ever col
lecting the debt; the few left who still
have faith are finding out that the
promises fulfilled by Phelan are few and i
far between.
The most recent case of his duplicity
is his attempt to place a license tax of j
$50 a month on the lkiuor-dealers, in the ,
face of his promise, made voluntarily be- ;
fore election, when he wanted their sup
port and their votes, that he would not
favor any measure that would disturb
the conditions then existing.
At present the license is $21 a quarter.
Phelan attempted at a caucus of the Su
pervisors, held about two weeks ago. to
force that body to place the tax at $600
a year. The Supervisors, having been ad
vised of his guarantee to the saloon men,
refused to accede to his demands. When
they fix the new license the figure will be i
$50 a quarter, which Is said to be satis
factory to the liquor men, although |
they do not thank the Mayor for the fa- j
vor.
The story of the saloon license
promise is on a par with all
of Phelan's methods of securing
political prestige. Shortly after the
late municipal conventions named
their candidates for Mayor a committee
of the San Francisco Protective As
sociation waited on both Phelan
and Horace Davis. The object of
the committee was not to exact any
promises from either Phelan or the gen
tleman who was to be his opponent. They
did not go to ask protection. They only
wanted to ascertain the stand of th;> two
candidates on the liquor queMlon - ami
learn if either was Inclined to be oppres
sive in the event of becoming the execu
tive officer of new San Francisco.
Phelan received the committee with
open arms. It represented an interest
that controlled a great number of votes
and the Mayor saw a chance to buy their
favor and support, with one of his
"phony" promises. The spokesman was
hardly given an opportunity to explain
the purpose of the visit tefore Phelan
volunteered the information that he was
the greatest friend the saloon men ever
had and promised that he would not
favor any measure calculated to Increase
their burdens.
"Why, the saloons are the best things
that ever happened." he is reported to
have said. "The outlying districts of the

LONDON. Jan.* 23, 4:15 a. m.â General
Bulltr has reported nothing of hli
operations on Monday and official
and press Intelligence leaves the
British bivouacked Sunday night on
the ground they had won after two days'
fighting. The War Office turned every
body out of the lobbies at midnight. Ap
parently Lord Lansdowne was as much
without news all yesterday as other per
sons were.
Military men assume that fighting must
have taken place and that it was prob
ably mere severe than on the two preced
ing c"ays. General Buller would not be
likely to give the Boers leisure to add to
th* elaborate 'ntrenchments, to arrange
their artillery and to concentrate their
forces.
The special correspondents Sunday night
were allowed to send the announcement
that tho battle would almost certainly be
resumed the following day and hence of
ficial and popular anxiety is at high ten
riar. The llrilitih military experts all
share the lu>pes of their leaders and as
â¢Spencer Wilkinson points out they "hesi
tate to s-ay a word that might be Inter
preted as unfavorable. Mr. Wilkinson re
fers to the "cooler Judgment of German
and Austrian critics." which means that
some of the best judges look upon Gen
<r;ii Kuller's enterprise as a forlorn hope,
as merely a continual strain of fighting,
which may prove too much for the phy
sical energy of the troops engaged.
The Daily Chronicle's military expert
says:
"Even when a battle is won In a single
day as a rule pursuit is only possible
when fresh troops are available. But in
this Instance it is not a question of mere
pursuit, but of renewing an attack upon
intrenched positions after a day's hard
fighting and a night of lying on the bat
tlefield."
Reinforcements aggregating 5000 or more
have reached Cape Town during the last
three days. It is uncertain how these
have been disposed of, but probably most
of them have bee n sent to Natal, where
It is believed General Buller needs them.

Some fears are expressed that the garri

The War Office has decided not to send
the Seventh Lancers. Eighth Hussars and
Seventh Dragoon Guards to South Africa,
although mobilized. It is understood that
Lord Roberts does not see a way to get
fodder for the English chargers. More
than that the English cavalry are too

Roberts expects to use colonial cavalry
instead.

PRE-ELECTION PROMISE
Deceives Saloon Men in Order

Agrees Not to Disturb License, but
Attempts to Raise It to $600 a Year
as Soon as He Attains Power.
Phelan attempted to carry his l*o.i*
into effect as soon as the new Board of
Supervisors was organized. He called the
members together in caucus about two
weeks ago and made the same suggestion
that he had voiced before the convention
of the League of California Municipalities,
and he argued that it was his wish that
the license In San Francisco should ar
bitrarily â¢bfr fixed -at $600 c. year. The Su
pervisors were not Inclined to any such
proposition. They had some sense of de
cency and fair play, and believed that tne
saloon men should at least be given a
hearing. The matter was referred to th<Â»
License Committee, consisting of Super
visors Comte, McCarthy and Booth. They
held a conference with the same commit
tee that had interviewed Mayor Phelan
before election. The result of the Inter-
Change of ideas was a decision, in de
fiance of the Mayor's protest, to place the
new license at $50 a quarter.
The saloon men do not entertain a very
high regard for the Mayor's Integrity .
and from the action taken by tho Boar.l

bers agree with the views of the liquor

The Mayor's oily eloquence so Im

circulated among the members of the
Protective Association, while not com
mitting Itself in words to the indorse
ment of Phelan. was so arranged that a
blind voter could have understood its In
tent. In big black-face type were the
words: "For Mayor, James D. Phelan,"
followed by "or Horace Davis," in letters
so small and Insignificant that nothing
was left to explain.
Phelan was elected and the votes of the
saloon men went a long way toward
bringing about his success. Presuming
Phelan to be a man of his word, the
liquor dealers did not Interest themselves
further In the license question until, dur
ing 1 the recent convention of the League
of California Municipalities, they were
astounded to learn of the Mayor's public
announcement that he favored taxing the
whisky men to the limit. In an address
before the convention he said in effect:
"New San Francisco will be confronted
with a deficiency In her revenue of near
ly $100,000 annually by reason of the abol
ishment of the business license. This sum
will have to be made up In some way. I
favor placing a tax of $1 on every nlcksl
ln-the-slot machine. This will produce
about $23,000. and I think that the rsat
should be taken out of the profits of tho
saloon men. Our license here Is but a
paltry $21 a quarter, while In Los Angelts
the liquor men are forced to pay J'WO a

signed was that the Great Northern could
not afford to abandon the field to the

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Flans for the Leasing of Grazing
Lands to Western Owners of
Livestock.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â The House
Committee on Public Land has deter
mined that whatever measure pass Con
gress to lease grazing landÃ, the Federal
Government will have charge of the leas
ing and the actual owners of herds will
have , their Interests well guarded. No
subletting and speculation in leaseholds
will be permitted, and syndicates which
own no stock will not be allowed to
squeeze men who do. With the leasing
policy will go that of renewing natural
forage on exhausted ranges, which the
Agricultural Department will aid the
leaseholder in carrying out. It is felt
keenly in Congress that the beef food
supply of the country will soon meet great
disaster if the ranges are not protected
from exhaustion by giving to leaseholders
a motive for their welfare. Whatever the
measure that becomes a law, the Interests
of the homesteaders on agricultural lands
and those of the miner on mineral lands
will be entirely preserved. Colonel. John
P. Iris-h of San Francisco was among
those who appeared before the committeo
and Its action was in thorough accord
with his argument.
The Secretary of the Treasury to-day
submitted to Congress estimates for de
fraying expenses i of the Government for
the fiscal year 1901 in collecting revenues
at Pacific Coast ports as follows:

FRENCH OFFICERS
ACCUSED BY ZOLA
Military Dossier Was
Tampered With.
PARIS, Jan. 22.â Em1l Zola gives In the
Aurore this morning the first installment
of the results of his Inquiry into the
charges made by the Petit. Journal in
May and July, 18PS, against his father, M.
Francois ; Zola. t He declares that he ap
plied successively to . General Billott. M.
Cavaignac and General Zurlinden, Minis
ters of War, to allow him- to see the mili
tary dossier dealing with his father's
case, but he was refused by each. Finally
the present Cabinet authorized General de
Gallifet to communicate the dossier to
him.
M. Zola, however, ascertained that the
dossier had been communicated to the no
torious Colonel Henry in March, IS9S, and
he insinuates that it was tampered with,
because now, while he has found one ot
two letters of Colonel Combes containing
the accusations against his father which
the Petit Journal published, the first let
ter and the eight documents referred to
in the second letter are missing.
SI. Zola says that both he and Maltre
Labor!, who has examined the dossier,
consider It singular that none of the docu
ments giving Francois Zola's explanations
and defense now remain. A choice seems
to have been made, he asserts, so that
the dossier consists purely of the docu
ments containing the accusation.
CARELESS MAN
CAUSES A WRECK
Cars Derailed and One
Life Lost.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
WATSONVILLE. Jan. 22.â A bad
wreck occurred at ah,out 9 o'clock this
morning on the Pajaro Valley narrow
gauge railroad at the Moro Co jo ranch,
about midway between this city and
Spreckels, In which the oldest engineer in
the employ of the company. C. N.
Wyckoff. lost his life. The wreck waa
caused by the carelessness of one. of the
beet-haulers at the ranch, who left a
large chain which had been of assistance
to him In unloading b^ets from the
wagons to the cars tied to the rails.
The derailed train was on its way from
Watsonville to Spreckela and was going
at a fair rate of speed, and the obstruc
tion was not noticed by the engineer or
fireman until they were close to it. The
fireman. Charles Green, escaped with
only a bad shaking up. while Engineer
Wyckoff was buried in the wreck of the
engine and the throw-off lever pierced
his body Just below the heart.
Engineer Wyokoff was a highly re
spected resident of this city, where he
had lived for many years. He was 47
years of age, and leaves a widow, three
sons, a mother, twa sisters and four
brothers to mourn his loss. Among the
latter are Mayor Wyckoit of Watsonville

ANOTHER BAD DAY
FDD MOLIMEUX
Prosecution Is About
Ready to Close.
NEW YORK, Jan. 22.â Assistant Pros
ecuting Attorney Osborne announced at
the close of to-day's session of the trial
of Roland B. Mollneux for the murder of
Mrs. Katherine J. Adams that the pros
ecution would close to-morrow. The only
new testimony introduced to-day was that
of Matthias M. Dodd, a clerk in the sta
tionery department of Tiffany. & Co., who
stated that Molineux had an account with
the firm in ISOS. This evidence is consid
ered important, because a Tiffany en
velope was found in the package of poison
sent to Harry Cornish, and the box in
which the poison was inclosed was a Tif
fany box.
Dr. Henry P. Loomis, the expert chem
ist who performed the autopsy on the I
body of rienry' C. Barnet. testified that I
there was no evidence that Barnet died j
of any disease; tnat if'he had died of
diphtheria evidence of the disease would
have been found in the body. Witness
had no doubt that Barnet died of cyanide
of mercury poisoning.
Dr. James Colwhite. a diphtheria expert
in the employ of the Board of Health, has
seen between 2000 and 3000. cases and sev
eral c> v anide of mercury poisoning cases,
and testified that Barnet could not have
i died from any cause except cyanide of
I mercury poisoning.
Dr. Frank Ferguson, a pathological ex
pert, who made an examination of Mrs.
Adams' body, testified that she died of
cyanide of mercury poison.
Dr. E. S. Potter, who attended Mrs. Ad
ams, testified to the circumstances of her
death. The cross-examination evinced a
desire by Attorney Weeks for the defense
to thow that Harry Cornish, who says he
drank some of the poison, was not really
taken sick, as he claimed to have been.
William Williams, a colored servant,
testified that he was formerly employed
at 152 West Seventy-fifth street, where
Molineux Is alleged to have lived with
Blanche Chesebrough under the name of
Mr. Chesebrough before he married her.
Williams identified Molineux as Mr.
Chesebrough.
The court refused to admit the testi
mony of Molineux at the Coroner's in
quest to be used against him.

M. Derodays, Editor Figaroâ Sir: There has
be*n communicated to me on board shi|) the
calumnies In Parisian papers which originate
In the Flffaro. You will at once print a formal
denial. 1 reserve the right on my return to
tell you what 1 think of your disloyal act.
"Le Figaro." continued the Count, after
he had translated his statement into Eng
lish, "is a paper bought by the highest
bidder. Why this man should have cir
culated such stories I don't know. I know
of no reason why such things should be
published except that we are in opposing
political parties. The editor thought he
would have a chance while I was on the
ocean to Bet some lies in circulation about
me.
"1 never gambled In my life," continued
Count de Castellane warmly. "1 never
played cards for money nor gambled in
any other form. I did not lose money in
speculation, and these stories are all fiUi
ncations and as false as they can be
There is no truth in them at all."
When the question of the relations be
tween himself and his wife was touched
upon. Count de Castellane said:
"Our relations are perfectly harmo
nious."
Then he smiled at his wife as she stood
by his side and she smiled at him. There
was seeming good feeling in the smiles.
With regard to their visit here the
Count and his wife said that they intend
ed to remain in New York for fifteen
days, though their plans might possibly
be changed. They are here to see the rel
atives and friends of the Countess. Count
de Castellane said he did not know if he
would go to Lakewood, where George
Gould has his winter residence. No ar
rangements had been made to go there
and the matter had not been taken up
The Count said that he did not know
whether George Gould would come to New
York City or not. He Bald if he did he
would meet him here.
_ PARIS. Jan. 22.-The Figaro publishes
Count Boni de Castellane's cablegram and
says:
"We disdain his insults, which don't
harm us. We shall be delighted to meet
him in the law court on condition that
the trial be a serious one and that noth
ing be kept back which would throw the
fullest light on the matter. But owing
to the professional secrecy of stock brok
ers there is only one means of clearly es
tablishing the truth, and this means lies
in the hands of De Castellane. Let him
request the Minister of Finance to send
an inspector to inquire of the stock
brokersâ the Minister of Finance can
alone do this at De Castellane's requestâ
and then we shall know positively if De
Castellane has been slandered, if he never
speculated on the Bourse. This is the
only course open to De Castellane. Every
thing else in his cablegrams of threats is
what the Americans call a 'bluff.' "
DE CASTELLANE
MAKES A DENIAL
Says He Has Not Lost
in Speculations.
NEW YORK. Jan. 22.â Count Bonl de
Castellane and the Countess de Castei
lane, nee Gould, arrived in this country
to-day on the French line steamship La
Hretagne from Havre. They went to the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The count, was
willing to talk about the stories of his
lossea by stock speculation and gambling.
He * peaks very good English, with a
slight accent- On the DeroUays matter
he said:
"Derodays! Well, what is Derodays?
Derodayb is a liar. He is a scoundrelâ
bay anything you like about him. He U
aâ what is such a person? He is nothing.
A nonentity. What should I care for him?
Oh, he is a iiar."
Iht Count evidently did not like the
storits that had been printed about him
and his alleged loss>t?s. He was asked it
he wcrjld challenge Derodays.
"Challenge!" he taid with hauteur.
"Certainly 1 shall not challenge such a
man. He is not the kind of man to ac
cept a challenge. No, 1 shall not challenge
him. but when I get back I shall slap his
lace with a stick if he does not retract.
Bee, monsifur, 1 have prepared a state
ment to stnd him."
The statement which Count de Castel
lane gave out in relation to Derodays,
editor of the Figaro, whence come the
stories that Count de Castellane lott sev

follows:
TUNNEL NUMBERS
THREE VICTIMS
?
Cave-In Probably Dueto
Carelessness.
Special Di?ratch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 22.â The cave-In at
the Third-street tunnel has proved fatal
to three of the twelve men who were Im
prisoned. They are:
W. T. LAMBIE, inspector.
WILLIAM PAULEY, night foreman.
JOHN VESENTINL
Lambie was caught by falling earth
near the mouth of the tunnel. He was re
leased at 8 o'clock Sunday night, after
having been imprisoned for nine hours,
and died half an hour later.
The body of William Pauley has not
been recovered. It is supposed to be cov
ered by tons "of earth near the entrance to
the tunnel.
John Vesentinl was caught in the north
drift of the tunnel and pinioned by broken
timbers so he could not move for thirty
hours. He was released at 5:43- to-night
and died fifty minutes later in the Re
ceiving Hospital.
John Mitchell and John Eckert, brick
layers, married, were rescued at mid
night Sunday. Max Costello, Frank Pela
6ler. John Kimberly. John Bprden, Jerry
Mohen, John \V. YVashburn and K. Kera
merle, laborers, were rescued at 5:30 this
morning.
The cave-in came with a crash ana there
was no chance for escape. Work was pro
gressing on the tunnel night and day for
weeks, and while numerous small cave
ins had occurred the men Had become ac
customed to them and consequently were
taken by surprise.
Lambie was near the mouth of the tun
nel, and in running to escape stumbled
over a clod of earth and was caught by
the falling mass. Pauley rushed for tho
entrance, but was also hit with the fall
ing earth and crushed to death. Vesentini
was caught before he could move and pin
1 loned as stated. The others, working un
derneath the brickwork, had 120 feet of
I tunnel in which to move.
The rescuers worked faithfully on the
two drifts and the shaft from the top. It
was risky work on account of the shift
ing earth. Lambie was quickly rescued
and attention was paid to the others.
They were released at midnight.
The accident is attributed to careless
timberin,g of the contractors, who had
been notified by the City Engineer the
work was unsafe and not up to the speci
fications. Inquests will be held to-mor
row, when it is expected censure willbe
pieced on the parties responsible for tha
terrible accident. Â¦:â¢ ?* â¢Â¦:>
Major W. T. Lambie was"C2 years of
age and has lived In I Los Angeles for
many years. He leaves a widow tnd two
daughters. He has had much experience
In tunnel work, having been chief engineer
on the San Fernando tunnel and other im
portant work of that character.
DAY OF ORATORY
IN THE SENATE
Philippine Question to
the Fore.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â This was an
other day of oratory in the Senate, little
beyond routine being transacted. Pritch
ard delivered a long and carefully pre
pared address on the race question in
the South, his remarks being addressed
particularly to the proposed amendment
to the constitution of North Carolina,
which, if enacted, he said, would disfran
chise a large mass of voters, both white
and black. He was followed by Turner
of Washington in a speech on the Philip
pine question, in which he arraigned the
administration's policy as set out In the
President's message and in the speech of
lit'veridge of Indiana.
Depew of New York, from the Commit
tee on International Expositions, favorably
reported a joint resolution authorizing the
President to appoint a member of the
Daughters of the Revolution as a repre-
Fentative of this Government at the un
veiling of the statue of Lafayette at the
Paris Exposition and to iepresent the
Government at the exposition.
Cockrell of Missouri called attention to
the fact that there was an understanding
that no woman should represent this Gov
ernment at the Paris Exposition, the
French Government having objected to
women representatives. Depew replied
that he knew of no such restriction, but
Allison said that such a restriction was
made. The Senate, without acting on the
resolution, went into executive session,
and at 4:4S p. m. adjourned.

ROCKEFELLER IN
ENTIRE CONTROL
Absorbs New York Pub
lic Utilities.
NEW YORK. Jan. 22.â The World to
morrow will say: A general consolidation
of all the gas. electric light and traction
systems of the city under the supreme
control of the Rockefellers is impending.
This is clearly Indicated by the election
of William H. Curtiss, private secretary
of William E. Rockefeller, as treasurer
of the Third-avenue Railroad Company
and by the election to-day of William C
Whitney, Anthony N. Brady and Thomas
P. Ryan as trustees of the Consolidated
Gas.
Mr. Curtiss' election is taken as proof
positive that the mighty influence of Wil
liam Rockefeller is behind Kuhn, Loeb &.
<"o. In the financing of new securities to
lake up the $17,000,000 of floating debt con
tracted by the changes in motive power of
the Third-avenue road, the extension of
its system to the Huckleberry line and the
purchase of the drydock and Forty-sec
ond-street Railroad.
It was said on good authority in Wall
street yesterday that the Rockefellers had
made arrangements to take over the
Henry Hart Interests, amounting 10 about
30,000 shares, valued at considerably more
than $3,000,000.
| Little is known of Mr. Curtiss except
that he Is a business man of tried ability
and has for years enjoyed the closest
confidence of the Rockefellers. In view of
the Intention of the Standard Oil men to
Increase their already large holdings of
Third avenue 6tcck, it was considered nat
ural that a representative should be
placed in the management to guard their
interests.
The Third avenue railroad shares were
active all day, 1700 shares changing hands
The stock made a net change of four
points, closing at 116, a half-point below
the highest quotation of the day. The
buying was of a good character.
The addition of Messrs. Whitney. Brady
and Ryan to the directorate of the Con
solidated Gas is regarded as another man
ifestation of the power of the Rockefeller
interests. It means that they have been
powerful enough to take the Whitn-y
crowd into camp and add them to the list
of their allies. It means that there has
been a general harmonizing of interests
brought about by Rockefeller influences'
which promises gigantic results. Directly
it marks the absorption of the New York
Gas, Electric Light, Heat and Power
Company by the Consolidated, and points
to the probability of an early end of the
gas rate war.

VAN LOBEN SELS
PLEADS FOR THE
GALLANT BOERS
Unitarian Club at a
Banquet.
DODSON DEFENDS ENGLAND
ELOQUENT DEBATE ON THE WAR
IN SOUTH AFRICA.
President Wheeler Declares History
Is All on the Side of Civilization
as Against Squatter
Sovereignty.
Amid the best with which California
can embellish the banquet board, about
two hundred members of the Â§tate Uni
tarian Club discussed last night the al
leged rights of the belligerents now stain
ing South Africa with blood. The ap
plause showed that there were many
sympathizers with both sides, and each
of the three speeches was pregnant with
fact and to its author convincing In Its
logic. Rev. G. R. Dodson opened with an
ardent defense of England; Consul Van
Loben Sels followed on behalf of his
colonial countrymen, , and President
Wheeler kept his opening promise to
speak all around the question and leave
something to the intelligence of his au
dience.
Rev. George R. Dodson of Alameda,
having been requested to open the de
bate, spoke in part as follows:
I wish to say at the beginning that I be
lieve the preponderance of evidence as to
who Is right Is In favor of Great Britain. It
has apparently been forgot that the Boers
were in 1534 a slave-holding people and that
this was originally the cause of trouble be
tween the English and Dutch in South
Africa. After some trouble the Dutch went
north, established a republic and later both
the Transvaal and Orange Free State were
granted independence in â¢ their internal
affairs. In the 70's England saved the Trans
vaal from bankruptcy and President Kru
gcr was glal to have matters thus arranged.
After Majuba Hill. Mr. Gladstone, unwisely,
no doubt, decided that the Boers knew Eng
land could beat them, the world knew It
and he withdrew from the contest. This was
Interpreted by the Boers as cowardice. Since
then the Boers have been ambitious to drive
the British out of South Africa.
When England guaranteed the protection
of- the Transvaal, she guaranteed It to the
outlanders as well as to the Boers. Now the
outlanders outnumber the Boers two to
one; pay nine-tenths of the taxes and own
three-fifths of the property. These outland
ers presented a strong petition to the Volk
rad and it was Jaughed at. Encland Is
fighting to guarantee the rights of 160,000
outlunders. who are merely anxious for
equal rights under the law. Not only on
general principles, but technically, England
is right In her proposition in South Africa
to-day. It Is a struggle of a highly civilized
race against a selfish, non-progressive race
and It will be better for the world that the
English should win.
It Is not a question of a few gold-seekers,
but It 1s a world-wide question. * I think
that the great principles which made this
countryâ which made Canada and Australia
â can well be applied to the development of
South Africa, India is another example of
the practical value of English rule.
P. J. Van Loben Sels, Consul from the
Netherlands, waa the next speaker.
The question we are discussing Is that of
which side the American commonwealth
should take In the present conflict In South
Africa, he said. England cannot claim the
rlKht of conquest, for the Boers bought the
till*? from the original eavaces; It cannot
claim the right of possession because this
territory has been in dispute for fifty years,
nor can It be claimed by treaty. After hav
ing treked and treked north out of the way
of the Enelish, the Boers, only wishing to
be le^t alone, reduced both the Transvaal
and Orance Free State.
In 1553 the Kngllsh promised by treaty to
recoÃnir-c both the soverelÃnty and the in
dependence of both republics. F\ir a time
England was satisfied with the land she
held, and seeing It to be a very expensive
task to pursue the Boers further she de
plsted her persecution for a time. In 1876
the British, seeing the prosperity of the
Transvaal, calmly announced the annexa
tion of the Boer republic. The Boers could
not tnÂ»k further, because England had pen
ned them In, had taken the land north and
west and had also blocked the. seaboard,
and when the Boers realized this It led to
the war of ISSI, which ended In the abso
lute defeat of the British arms at Majuba
Hill.
At that time England had a statesman,
Mr. Gladstone, and he, unlike Mr. Cham
berlain, knew what he was up against when
he tackled the Boers. A treaty was drawn
up at Pretoria, in which the suzerainty of
England was acknowledged, but this waa
never ratified by the Boers. Later Mr. ICru-
Ker. General Joubert and Mr. Schmidt went
to London and a new treaty was drawn up
in which England recognized the absolute
Independence and suzerainty of the Trans
vaal, and the only other feature was that
the Transvaal should not enter Into a
treaty with any other nation except the
Orange Free State without England having
power to veto within six months.
After the defeat of Majuba Hill England
decided to do by the ballot box what she
could not do by force of arms. So she flooded
the country with English and then demanded
the franchise for them. These Englishmen
merely went there to make a fortune. They
did not Intend to stay; they did not assimi
late with the country, they were merely ad
venturers who wanted everything In sight,
and who did not wish even to pay their
chare of the taxes.
Napoleon once said an English army wan
a troop of lions led by asses. Bismarck
paid some years ago that England would
dig her crave In South Africa before the
close of the nineteenth century. If it takes
a hundred years to make a century there Is
time yet for Bismarck's prophecy to be ful
filled.
I deny that English ideals or civilization
are In any way higher or more to be desired
than Dutch ideals or civilization. England
still has the relic of barbarismâ the law of
primogeniture and the House of Lords, the
latter of which will cause her downfall In
Fouth Africa.
Professor Benjamin Tde Wheeler of the
University of California was Introduced
to Vpive a scholar's view of the great
question now being solved In South Af
rica." Mr. Wheeler said:
In- this matter we are dealing not with
this year or the last, but with a time when
things are working themselves out and
when It lfl becoming In us to view things

CHARLES B. GIBSON
CHARGED WITH FORGERY
Milpitas Woman Claims That He
Passed a Worthless Note
on Her.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 22.-Charles B. Gibson,
a well-known real estate dealer, with of
fices In the Porteo block, was arrested
on a charge of forgery. The complaint
was sworn to by Mrs. Refugio de Bernal
of Milpltas. and she charges him with
forging the name of County Auditor
Thomas F. Morrison to a note for $600.
A short time ago Mrs. Bernal's husband
died, leaving her $2000 insurance in the
Workmen. Gibson is financier of Enter
prise Lodge, and according to complain
ant he at once laid plans to secure some
of this money. She says Gibson made
many trips to her home at Milpltas and
made all kinds of Inducements to her for
loaning the money. Finally he told her
that Auditor Morrison wanted to borrow
$600 and would give his note as security.
Mrs. Bernal finally consented and gave
Gibson the money. In return she re
ceived a note purported to be signed by
Morrison, bearing date of December a,
1599, with Interest fixed at 9 per cent. The
note was payable in six months.
A few days ago Morrison's appointment
as auditor of the Postal Department for
the Philippine? was announced. Mrs.
Bernal decided she wanted her $600 be
fore he left and gave the note to Attor
ney Owen D. Richardson to look after.
Then it was that the forgery was discov
ered. , Â¦' '-
Gibson, was arraigned beforo Justice
Wallace. His preliminary examination
was set for February 1, and bail fixed at
$2000. Â¦Â¦Â¦_:...
Until a couple of months ago Gibson
was a great society favorite, and was
engaged to be married to a prominent
young lady of this city. Of late he has
been gamblinlg heavily, and his friends
lay his downfall to the "crap" table.
A number of Gibson's friends are try-
Ing to square the matter, and In all prob
ability the woman will receive her $600.

RUNS AMUCK ON
CROWDED STREET
Negro Slain After Shoot
ing Three Men.
MACON, Ga., Jan. 22.â Two negroes
were shot to death and two white men
desperately wounded, as the result of an
attempt to arrest a negro here to-day.
J. H. Butler (colored) is the man who
did the most of the shooting and who was
himself shot to death. His .victims were
Armstead Bryant (colored), shot through
the heart; B. Hellman (white), shot
through the stomach and probably will
die. and John Reed (white), shot in the
neck and is in a precarious condition.
Butler threatened to kill a negro woman
and when Policeman Pearce attempted to
arrest him began to shoot. The negro
ran up Fourth street, one of the busiest
streets in Macon, pistol In hand, shooting
at everybody In sight. His first victim
was Hellman, then Bryant, and Reed was
the last to fall before his aim. The sound
of the shooting attracted a number of

ing their trials the police have been sub
jected to all kinds of bulldozing and In
sinuations of perjury and prejudice. I
think that this Council owes us some kind
of a vindication. We have no flght against
a saloon, but against a man who runs a
gambling game. We know also that we
heard orders given for drinks In Rosen
befg's saloon after midnight. We are just
as quick to protect a saloon man as If
he engaged in any other business. YV c
have every confidence in this Council giv
ing us a vindication and are thanking
goodness we are not now before a Police
Court."
Peterson also referred to a signal bell
rung at Rosenberg's front gate, and he
declared that besides "craps," stud
horse poker was played at Rosy's, and
he told of wives and mothers who had
complained to him about these gambling
dens.
Sergeant McKinley's testimony was in
the same tenor. He declared in addition
that several times during the past
month he saw persons ring the "signal
bell" as late as 2 and 3 a. m.. and that
the iron gate was opened and the ringer
admitted at Rosenberg's.
Oflicer Pardee, who also took part In
the raid, testified to hearing calls for
drinks on the night of the raid.
Joe Rosenberg was called en his own
behalf. He denied all knowledge of any
game until his attention was called to It
by the police, and said that he discharged
Sig Richardson when complaint was
made to him. He denied positively that
he was in the room where the crap game
was played, as the police had testified.
Councilman Cuvellier wanted to know
why a crap table was kept on the place
if it was not for use, and Rosenberg said
that it was going to be put in the cellar.
Mr. Rosenberg then detailed his story of,
the raid.
The Council said that they did not want
any testimony as to- the former character
of Mr. Rosenberg, which had been good.
A search was made for Slg Richardson,
who was accused of being the banker,
but he had gone home.
Councilman Upton moved that the li
cense be revoked upon the ground that
a crap game wa3 run there, and Coun
cilman Oirard seconded the motion. L.
S. Church, the attorney for JoÂ« Rosen
berg, argued that Rosenberg had always
kept an orderly house and that there was
no law that would permit the revoking
of a license for anything except keeping
a disorderly house.
After the argument the Council re
voked Rosenberg's license by a vote of 8
to 1, as follows: Against the licenseâ

ent cf the world, for under the new condi
tions it is impossible.
There is no doubt that the average Eng
lishman you meet going about the world is
a very unpleasant fellow, but he is hardy,
vigorous and full of fiber. The English are
hard to deal with. You have to hit them
as this country did in the Venezuelan ques
tion, and then they acknowledge that they
are kin with you.
Now, I have said that the Englishman
may be rough, harsh, perhaps brutal, but
the English love fair play. This has made
the British empire stronger than that of old
Rome. This Is due to the fact that every
Englishman knows and has a right to know
that wherever the Union Jack floats all men
are assured fair play.
In our country a certain band of people
held peculiar views. They went west to
the valleys of Utah, but we found them out;
we destroyed their Institutions and inter
fered with their religious Ideas, but it is
all part of the civilization that controls the
organization of our society. History can
always shown that civilization transcends
the law of squatter sovereignty. The man
who makes wealth and commerce and who
helps to build up the cosmopolitan life that
Is more and more in demand must, even by
the sword of tyranny, drive out the peoples
of the valley, even as the steam engine
drove the buffalo from his home on the
plains.

OAKLAND. Jan. 22.â The Council to
night Investigated the saloon of Joe

raided about a month ago. Councilman
Girard called up the resolution ordering
the Investigation saying: "I am opposed
to these gambling dens. I believe in

that games have been played there I will

Captain W. J. Peterson of the police

around a crap table, playing a banking

constantly under restraint. Previous to
her death he showed signs of Insanity,
which subsequent to her demise became
fully developed. His death was hastened
by an attack of paralysis, which came on
suddenly. The general feeling in court
circles Is that It was a merciful release,
though putting the finishing touches on
the gloom now overwhelming society,
and there Is now no prospect of any so

Mr. Bryan, when asked later If he had
any plans lor bringing back gold Demo
crats to the party, replied:
"Yes. I have plans. In the first place
many have already come back. In the
fcecond place there are some who will
never come back, and it is no use to work
on them. In the third place there are
gome who will reiurn on one or two
groundsâ either Unit they now like the
Chicago platform, although they did not
In li'j6, or that they favor the Democratic
pqs-'ition on national questions and are
willing to take the whole platform, while
Hot agreeing Kith every part of it.
"The only way to keej) present Demo
crats In the party and bring gold Dem
ocrats back and induce Republicans to
join us is to advocate measures that are
best for the people, and thus deserve their
Mipport. 1 believe that the Chicago plat
form, with new questions, including
strong planks against trusts and Im
perialism, would give excuse to everybody
to vote the Democratic ticket In 1900.""
Mr. Bryan was a^ked if he regarded
any of the three issues as the dominant
<Â¦: â¢ . but he taiil he did not care to dis
cuss their relative importance. As to
whether he intended to discuss only the
trusts and imperialism while lit the East
to the exclusion of silver, he paid he
would discuss all three whether he was
in Lhe East or in the West. While here.

local politics.

OBJECT TO GIVING A
DINNER TO BRYAN
Members of the New York Demo
cratic' Club Address a Letter
of Protest.
NEW YORK, Jan. 22.â The following
letter, signed by John Fox. a former
president of the Democratic Club and
now a member of the Board of Gov
ernors; Robert B. Roosevelt and John F.
Doyle, was sent to-night to John W. Kel
lar, president of the Democratic Club:
It is with the most kindly greeting, and
certainly with no desire to criticize your acts,
that we take the liberty, as members of the
Democratic Club, to address you. We are cred
ibly Informed that you have Invited William J.
Bryan to become your guest at the Democratic
Club and take dinner with you and a party of
friends. In other words, Mr. Bryan is to be
entertained by you. and the place of such en
tertainment is at the Democratic Club. While
It is your unquestionable right, or the right of
any other member, to invite any gentlemen
who may choose to become his guest at the
club, yet under existing conditions we greatly
fear that your act will become construed by the
public as the act of the club should you give
such a dinner to this distinguished guest with
out affirmatively disclaiming such intention on
the i?art of the club.
We ourselves can fully distinguish between an
official act and "individual opinions." We
want It understood, too, that we have no per
sonal objection to Mr. liry&n, nor do we object
in the slightest degree to your giving him a
dinner at the club in your individual capacity
as one of its members. We should much re
gret, however. If what you propose to do should
be construed throughout the country as a po
litical indorsement by the Democratic Club of
the Presidential candidacy, at this time, of
Mr. Bryan. The Democratic Club is essentially
a Democratic political organization and of Its
SC-00 members none but Democrats belong to It.
You are now its president, and in the absence
of a disclaimer on your part to the contrary
your course In anything that pertains to the
club or its affairs might be construed, and not
unreasonably so, as the act of the club. It
will nut do to say that such a construction
would only be placed upon your acts by the
â¢smurant or misinformed, because Mr. Bryan
himself has established a precedent which Is
applicable to the case now in point. We de
fire to call your attention to a portion of the
correspondence which took place before your
immediate predecessor as president of the club
and the distinguished gentleman whom, you
have invited to be your guest at the club. You
will remember that Mr. Bryan now stands be
fore the nation as an avowed aspirant seek
ing the Democratic Presidential nomination.
Here the letter cites the acrimonious
correspondence between Mr. Bryan and
Perry Belmont, growing out of Mr. Bry
an's declination of the Democratic Club's
invitation to the Jefferson Day banquet
laFt April, In which he condemned â¢â¢politi
cal communion between Jefferson Demo
crats who stood upon the Chicago plat
form and the Republican allies who mas
querade as Democrats between cam
paigns in order to give more potency to
their betrayal of Democratic principles
on election day." The letter continues:
It may be fairly Inferred from all of the
foregoing that if you were rot considered by
Mr. Brian as an avowed believer In his doc
trine of free and unlimited silver coinace at
the ratio of 16 to 1 he would also have declined
jour invitation on the ground that * - no party
advantage is to be derived from political com
munion" with you at the Democratic Club. We
don't believe In the wisdom of free coinage at
that ratio. We do know, however, that we are
Democrats and are interested in the success of
the Democratic party In the city. In the State
and in the nation. This beinc true, we sin
cerely but respectfully urge upon you. occupy
ing as you do the position of president of the
club, not to do anything which would tend to
forestall the action of the next Democratic
National Convention.
As individuals we Insist upon, the right to
express our opinions In regard to the future
policy of our party and the selection of its
nominees. We believe It unwise to permit the
opinion to go broadcast throuchout the land
that the Democratic Club of this city or the
Democratic party of this State, so far In ad
vance of the convention, are irrevocably com
mitted to the indorsement of the principles
of the last national platform or of the views
of the last President lal nominee.
We are painfully aware of the fact that In
ISC'6 we lost the State of New York by 263,463
and the city by more than 20,000. It Is our
desire. If possible, to prevent a repetition of
another euch Democratic political disappoint
ment. In conclusion, let us again repeat that
we take this course In pood feelinc and to pre
vent, if possible, a misconstruction of your In
dividual act as being the act of the Democratic
Club.

"ES^ I other happenings of
>Qffi^ the day. The big
fellow not only
shouldered 123
pounds and defeated
a fashionable field, but equaled the
rcast record of 1:26 for seven furlongs
at the Fame time. There were ter; start
ers, and so adroitly adjusted were the
weights that Dr. Sheppard. the favorite.
vrith 123 pounds up, was 3 to 1 at post
time. Johnny Schorr thought he had an
ace In the holo, the price about F. W.
Brcxie failing from 13 to C. Meanwhile
Fred Foster and the Oakland contingent
were slipping twenties in the books on
Tellowtail. until all the 5 and 6 to 1 in
sight had been thoroughly eradicated. At
the post Dicmed delayed matters for a
time, but Fcrsruson finally sent the bunch
off nicely aligned. For nearly half a mi!Â».
Jones, first ay.ay on St. Cuthbert. showed
in front. His lead was of short duration,
for Jenkins soon headed him with Yel
lowtail. and although F. W. Brodo got up
dangerously close the final sixteenth, the
slashing chestnut won cleverly by a neck.
Spencer on Ventoro took the show, with
Dr. Sheppard back in sixth position.
Superintendent FleJdwlck had the
course in splendid condition as usual,
but the weather was not propitious for
record breaking, being raw and chilling.
Notwithstanding, some very fast time
was made by the different winners. Snul
of Tarsus bore the honor of bcinjj the
one lonely favorite to thrive.
In his morning workouts oaul 'had been
cultivating rjuite a strt ak of speed and he
went ;â¢> thÂ« post a 4 to T> favorite for the
opening scramble. He made all the run
ing, and won from Corolla with Spencer
easing him up. Away none too well,
Gundara; with 117 pounds in the saddle,
finished a good third.
Spencer in the saddle sent the black
horse Faversham out post favorite for
the sevefl furlong selling run. He never
looked a winner. Mike Rice led to within
a furlong of the stand, where Jones on
Tom Cromwell got up. beating the out
sider, with something to spare.
The old favorite David Tenny made hl<Â»
first appearance among the starters for
the mile and a sixteenth run, and waÂ«
at once installed favorite. He appeared
slow In running the bags and was eventu
ally left on third. Scotch P'.ald. the mount

Not many played her. and the mare won
all the way In 1:14 flat. l>ost Girl snatched
the place from Cormorant. Panam'nt,
again made favorite, acted as target bear

Dr. Nc-mbula seems to be a horse born
under on unlucky star. Fast as a bullet,
something is always happening to him.
Sent to the post favorite for the closing
mile run. Tod Walsh fell fast asleep, and
with do grip on the right rein was lr.st

the stretch until The Fretter drew up on

Jark Martin then just kicked Fretter in

the favorite out for third place.
Track Notes.
The meeting l>cgan with fifteen books.
About the hardest knock they received
was the stak^ event, the smart ones
"whip-awing" it.
Fred Foster and tho Oakland contin
gent were credited with taking JIO,OC>O out

prunlng-knifo process.
Charley Fair again backed Merops. al
most evening up thing's for tho Tanforan

Bullman is again riding in good form,
and if he will be careful about rough rid
ing will soon become a public idol again.
The horses in training owned by J.
Naglee Burk will be sold at the track on
Thursday. January 25. In the lot are
some very useful breadwinners, and no
doubt the sale will be a great success.
Coda. Dolore. Espirando. Festoso, Furia,

BAKERSFI ELD, Jan. 22.â The Paci
fic Coast fu-ld trials began to-day at
Bakersfleld. On account of the late
arrival of Judge Johnson the draw
ing did not take place until about
9 o'clock this morning. The members'
stake was scheduled as the first event,
but owing to the fact that several of the
club members who were expected to make
entries did not arrive it was decided to be
gin with the Derby and postpone the
members' stake until to-morrow.
There were fourteen entries in the
Derby, as follows: J. E. Lucas' 1. and w.

down was Stockdale Kennels' Schley.
handled by Fred Coutts, and Ella X,
handled by J. E. Lucas. Neither "of the
dogs seemed In first class form and hunt
ed rather listlessly, owing probably to the
heat, as at this hour the sun was shining
and the weather was warm. The course
was up a dry creek bed, and a half mile
had been covered before birds were found.
It was a scattered bevy and most of them
running ones, and very little work was
done by either of the dogs. They were
taken up at 1:33 p. m.
Tho next pair downâ Dr. Wilson's Sil
ver Star, handled by himself, and Hick
man's Negro Joe, handled by W. B.
Coutts. This brace, like tho preceding
one, seemed unable to handle 1 the birds
and appeared unaccustomed to work in
such thick cover. There was little op
portunity for either speed or range, al
though any advantage was in favor of
the black pointer, Negro Joe. Both dogs
seemed to be disturbed by the specta
tors and had a tendency to return to the
handler much oftener than was neces
sary. The clogs were taken up at 2:22.
At 2:30 Stockdale Kennels' Zen, handled
by B. M. Dodge, and Gardiner & Betten's
, Lorenzo, handled by Betten, were turned
down. This pair showed some of the
prettiest work of the day. The course
was along the edge of the timber and
partly in the open, and the range and
speed of the puppies was considered bet
ter than that of those down before. Birds
were soon found and a point was scored
for Zop. who was steady to wing. Al
most immediately Lorenzo scored a
stanch point and steady to shot and
wing. Zep made the third point and
there was little opportunity after this for
the dogs to score, as the birds by this
time had been lost. They were taken up
at 2:53.
The, next brace was Walter Hobarfs
Chief, Coutts handler, and Dr. Wilson's
Dixie Queen, handled by Wilson. This
was at 3 p. m. and the dogs were turned
down In an open field and showed plenty
of speed and range, especially so in the
case of Chief, who ranged well out and
hunted his ground with gÂ«od Judgment.
The dogs went a half mile through the
open and into a corn field, where a bevy
point was made by. the Chief, who held
it stanchly until the birds flushed. After
the flush neither dog seemed able to lo
cate a Bingle bird and they were taken
up at 3:45. which was the longest heat
of the day.
H. H. Kerckhoff's Blanco, Coutts
handler, and Gardiner & Betten's Wood
craft, Betten handler, were the next pair
down and each did some fairly good
work. They were hunting some time in
the open field, but failed to locate birds,
and were sent back to the timber, where
a small bevy was flushed by the spec
tators. Woodcraft soon located a single
bird, which he pointed, but the bird
flushed before the handler got near. He
followed with a second point and again
the bird flushed, but he was steady to
wing on both occasions. Blanco made
the next point and dropped to wing very
nicely. This ended the work of the pair.
They were taken up at 4:40.
C. Young's Duke. Coutts handler, and
Gardiner & Betten's Bonnie Gem should
have run the next heat, but as Bonnie
Gem was not on the ground the Stock
dale Kennels' Pluto, Dodge handler, and
W. S. Davis' Pride of Ross, Coutts
handler, were called. Both of these dogs
were a bit wild and the handler found it
almost impossible to control them. . They
were both willing enough, but in their
anxiety flushed several birds that should
have been pointed. They were taken up
at 4:43, which closed the running for to
day.
Duke and Bonnie Gem will be the first

HENRT LEWIS, the local colored i
Ufhtvrelffht, who has defeated somÂ«: !
of the best men in his class during j
thÂ» p :st vrar. is to bo pilt;d apainst j
Jack Hull. .1 vtll-iinown fighter, at the j
monthly exhibition of the Columbia Ath- j
Irtic Club, next Friday evening. The men j
have sipnod at 135 pounds and will box i
oipht rounds. Tlu y will certainly put up
a fast and clever exhibition if past bat- j
:;.s in which they participated be a crite
rion.
On thÂ«Â» sam*Â» evening Jack Dean v.-Ul
fight Charles Johnson at the same weight.
As this l>out is looked upon as the event
of thÂ«* evening some good sport is as
purt-d. Both lads have local reputations
and they intend to uphold their standing
by winning. Charles Frost and "Kid"
Finnerty are also to moot in the sara?
ring at the bantam weight, and Phil
BakT and Jack Carr. two h< avy-weights
practically unknown to followers of the
rinjr. but who are higrhly recommended
by thoir respective backers, are to battle
eight rounds for fame and money.
The ahoviÂ» bouts wr-re arranged with tho
sole idea of pleasing the followers of the
boxing game. No fa.khig will be counte
nanced by the club management, as it is
in the boxin;? business to stay. The offi
cers of the Columbia Athletic Club are:
President. Dan Crowley: vice president,
Jamos P. Kanp; secretary. Charles Sum
merlad; treasurer. John EppingÂ«r; press
agent, Gilbert "Fatty" Blades; directors

Tho Hub has secured thÂ«Â» building now
occupi<^d by thr- "B.ittlf> of Manila-Bay"
panorama, and it will shortly be ar
ranged into an arena for boxinij, and It
is expectM to surpass anything: of its
kind in the State for location, comfort
and Matins capacity.
Blpr Joe Kennedy, the south side heavy
weight, who was to have met Jack Stelz
ner before the Monarch Athletic flub on
the last night of the present month, has
thrown up his contract and the fight is
iow but a dream of the past. Kennc-dy
had two excuses to offer for his failure
to abide by his agreement. The first iÂ»
that the Monarch Club would not allow
him to take the entire proceeds, and sec
ondly, that he could not get into condition
in two weeks' training. Some one tamil
iar with Kennedy's character was unkind
enough to say that he- was afraid f o <I<>
battle with Stelzner, having in mind th<*
hard light the latter gave him in Sep.em
ber, IS9S, when Kennedy barely secured
a decision over his much lighter opponent
after twenty rounds of hard righting. It
is regretted by all lovers of the sport that
Kennedy backed out. as they counted on
peeing a good battle. Stelzner 13 greatly
disappointed. He was confident that he
could <We;tt Kennedy and wanted to da
so. as it would remove the stigma of the
decision the latter pot over him.
Al Neil! called on Manager Glbbs of th^

received below the waist from O'Brien at

Neill asked for th^ postponement, as he
is desirous of being In grood fettle the

LYONS A FAST FIGHTER.
NEW YORK. Jan. 22â Henry Lyons of
Chicago knocked out Joe Cain of Brook
lyn in the concluding round of the twen
ty-five round bout at catch weights be
fore the Hercules Athletic Club in Brook
lyn to-night. For an unknown, Lyons
proved a revelation, his cleverness beirtK
beyond the ordinary. Up to and including
the tenth round it proved to be one of the
best 12C-pound battles seen in the East
and gave an insight into what might be
expected to follow. Although Cain was
literally beaten to pieces, he put in many
stiff punches on Lyons' head and body
but the colored boy always had a shade
the better of it. In the thirteenth round
Cain's left eye closed entirely and ren
dered him at a great disadvantage. At

GREGGAINS IN DANGER.
The life of Alec Greggalnsâ refer**,
prizefight promoter, politician ar.d all
around good fellowâ ls in danger, and that
versatile gentleman is not aware of the
fact. Joe Butler, the pugilist, writ** from
sleepy Philadelphia that It would give
him joy to knock Alec's head off and do
other unpleasant things to him. He has
a grievance against Greggains which will
never be satiated until the tatter's gore
bestrews the ground.
A letter was received from the bellig
erent fighter yesterday, in which Rutler
states that he noticed in a local paper
that Greggalns said he did not ask him
(Butler) to let up on him when they
fought before the Ariel Club some year*
ago. He said that Greggains did make
the request, and he can prove it by "Boh"
Deady and John Fogarty. Butler also
pays that hÂ» hopes to cross Gregsrains'
path some day and make him eat his
words. He accuses Alec of calling him a
liar, and as the local man has a good ap
petito he will not have to digest much of
a meal. Still Butler seems in earnest, so
Greggains must beware of storms when
he is in the Philadelphia pugilist's vi
cinity.

Testimony in Case of Mrs. Jacobson
Against Rabbi Myers.
The trial of the suit of Mrs. G. H.
Jacobson against Rabbi Myers for the re
funding of $235. alleged to be due for
money expended for transportation from
Melbourne to San Francisco, was re
sumed yesterday morning In Justice
Groezingers court. Mrs. Myers, wife of
the defendant in the case, testified that
she had never written a letter to the
Jacobsons at Melbourne in which she
had either promised to send them funds
or to reimburse them for '.raveling ex
penses. Mrs. Myers further declared
that Rabbi Myers had never intended
paving for the Jacobsons' transportation
here.
R. D. Rapken, a capitalist, was then
put upon the stand by the defense. He
testified that he had lived in Melbourne
for twenty years; that for fifteen years
he had belonged to the Philanthropic
Society of that place, and that he had
known Mrs. Jacobson to be aided hun
dreds of times. "She was a needy and
worthy woman." said he. "and we aided
her with sums ranging from 30 shillings
to $5 a week."
Attorney Crowley attempted to ques
tion the truthfulness of Rapken's state
ment, but Judge Groezinger said that he
was convinced that Rapken was telling
the truth. Some excitement followed the
Judicial utterance and the case was
finally continued until to-morrow morn
ins.

VALLEY ROAD NEWS.
Construction Proceeding Rapidly and
Completion Near at Hand.
If the present weather continues for a.
few weeks the Valley road will be in a
position to deliver its first consignment
of freight and its first load of passengers
to San Francisco by the Ist of April. All
that is now delaying the construction is
the mud which has resulted from the re
cent heavy rains.
The big viaduct at the end of the Al
hambra valley is now completed am!
trains are running over it. All the bridge*
are likewise in working order and do-.'.ig
the business for which they were cnir
structed. Tracks have been laid through
two of the tunnels and the others are
ready to receive the rails as soon as the
engineers decide to put them in.
The entire length of embankment h<TÂ»
been built, and all that now remains to
complete the line to Point Richmond Is to
lay some twenty miles of track, which
will be an easy and simple task as soon
as the ground becomes dry and hard
enough to permit of the work being re
sumed.
The construction of the Point Richmond
wharf Is being hurried and a couple of
weeks will witness Its completion.
DESIGN OF WINDOW AND CRYPT IN THE COLUMBARIUM.
AN art treasure has Just been added to the beautiful Columbarium in
Odd Fellows* Cemetery- It is a crypt on the ground floor erected by
Mrs. Douglas T. Cone, a wealthy resident of Red Bluff, and was de
signed by Victor de Prosse, a well-known architect and artist of this
city, who personally supervised its construction.
The window represents Clotho spinning the threads of Immortal life.
The crypt Is of the purest selected California onyx, designed in simple
Renaissance style. It is trimmed with a full relief bronze frieze of antique
design. Angel heads of antique bronze with flower design, interwoven at
both sides of the pilasters, carry the onyx and metal frieze. The front is
faced with an antique bronze panel and btVel plate glass. The top has also
been made of glass to allow the reflection of the beautifully soft colored
lights of the window above into the Interior of the crypt.
The crypt holds a bronze urn which is finished In antique green on the
outside. It stands on a block of beautiful reddish onyx and Is mainly
Baroque In design.
Mr. de Prosse has succeeded in his desire to do away with the gloomy
style which characterizes most burial places, and while there Is dignity in
his whole design it Is also bright with hopefulness.
All the bronze work was modeled, cast and chased In this city and the
onyx work was finished here.
M'CALL PLANS FOR
A NEW CAN FACTORY
HE FINALLY SAYS THE STORY
IS CORRECT.
Beyond This No Information Is Ob
tainable, but Canners Are Keenly
Interested.
The condition of local canners of fruit
and makers of fruit cans appears to be
Improving. Yesterday Mr. McCall of Chi
cago, who represents Eastern capitalists,
acknowledged that he was interested In
the establishment of a new can manu
facturing plant In this city. Further
than this he declined to talk, but gave
out the impression that the deal with
which he was connected had not yet been
completed. He did not know when he
would be ready to give out any additional
facts.
An Interesting story, well authenti
cated. Is that Mr. McCall has, since his
arrival in this city, urged upon canners
of fruit who are not in the canners' com
bine that it would not be wise for them
to make any contracts for their cans for
the coming year until they have heard
what he had to offer. The report is also
out that he said to one concern that the
people whom he represents have already
shipped machinery to be used In the new
can plant, irom the East.
This report Is of special interest to
the local canners who are not in the com
bine, for .the local can-makers have been
about to make contracts with the can
neries for the ensuing term. An odd
feature of the case is that Mr. McCall has
failed to call upon several canners. A
rumor was out last night that a dicker
was under way for the lease of the build
ing formerly occupied by the Pacific Sheet
Metal Works, on Townsend street, for a
new can factory. Interesting develop
ments are expected shortly.
EVELINE MATTHEWS HAS
STRANGELY DISAPPEARED
LEFT A NOTE EXPRESSING HER
REGRET.
Did Not Take Her Wardrobe and Her
Friends Pear She Has Com
mitted Suicide.
S. A. Newman of 1311 Greenwich street
called at the Morgue yesterday and re
ported that Miss_ Eveline Matthews, who
resided on the southeast corner of Hyde
and Green streets, disappeared from home
last Friday and had not been heard from
since. Miss Matthews is 20 years old, five
feet tall and weighs about 125 pounds.
Her hair is red. She wore a black Alpine
hat^a navy blue dress and tan Bhoes. Mr.
Newman requested the Coroner's depu
ties to notify Captain John A. Miller at
202 Market street should her body be
found.
It Is believed that the young woman
has 'made away with herself. She was a
homeless girl, with a drunken father
somewhere in this city, and six months
ago she was taken in and given a home
by Captain and Mrs. Miller. The girl's
conduct was exemplary and the Millers
do not know of any reason why she
should seek to kill herself.
Last Saturday morning she rose at the
usual hour and prepared the breakfast
for the family. That was the last seen of
her by her patrons. She left a note, in
which she stated Â¦ that she was going
away, that she regretted being obliged to
do so, and asked them to forgive her.
It was thought at first that the girl had
become involved in a love affair and had
eloped, but when It was discovered that
she had taken away with her only the
clothes she had on and left the remainder
of her wardrobe at home the suspicion
arose that, probably brooding over some
secret trouble, she had committed suicide,
either by drowning herself in the waters
of the bay or by taking poison in some
out of the way place where her body
would not easily be found.
TEN THOUSAND
FOR HIS VOTE
Price Offered a Montana
Legislator.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 22.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
held but a brief session to-day on ac
count of the non-appearance of witnesses.
President Smith of the Montana National
Bank and Representative Murray of the
Montana House of Representatives were
the only witnesses on the stand. Smith's
testimony was immaterial. Murray testi
fied that he was offered JlO.OOO to vote for
Senator Clark by persons whom he con
sidered representatives of that gentle
man.
Evidently the purpose of calling Smith
was to show transactions cf the bank in
volving Senator Clark or members of the
last Montana Legislature. Smith could
recall the names of only a few members
who had accounts at the bank last win
ter, and these had, he said, been deposit
ors at the bank for several year?. Neither
Clark nor Wellcome had transacted any
business in the bank during the last ses
sion of the Legislature, except that Clark
had opened an account just prior to the
close of the session. Clark had then given
him a personal check for J.%0.000, and had
never drawn upon the account since.
Smith said that the bank kept no record
of JI'XK) bills passing through it. and he
did not remember giving any out except
in one or two instances, which cases were
not connected with the Legislature or the
Senatorial contest. His bank anil the
hank of Clark & Brother of Butte ex
changed business.
Patrick W. Murray, a member of the
Montana Legislature from Butte. testi
fied that he had several times been ap
proached and his vote solicited for Clark
for Senator. He detailed the particulars
of two interviews with Gallick. a sup
porter of Clark, who had on both occa
sions held up his hands and spread out
his fingers and thumbs, saying that he
(the witness) could have that for his vote
if cast for Clark for Senator. He also
said that George Casey had come to him
to buy a piece of mining ground which
the witness owned, but that the condition
of the f=ale was that he should vote for
Clark for Senator. He had refused all
the propositions because Clark had op
posed the election of the ticket on which
he made the race for the Legislature.
Murray said he had not been employed
by Marcus Dalv for fourteen years and
was under no obligations to that gentle
man, i
At this point the prosecution announced
that it had no more witnesses on hand,
and the committee adjourned until to
morrow. --'.--â¢ Â¦

EAGLE EVE OF
HEALTH BOARD
ON PATRONAGE
No Position Is to Be
Overlooked.
PLACES IN LEPER HOSPITAL
STEWARD AND DAY WATCHMAN
SLATED TO GO.
Lepers Are Greatly Excited Over a
"Dark Lantern" Decision to Re
appoint a Former Employe
of the Institution.
The lust of patronage is strong with thÂ©
new municipal administration, and espe
cially is this trait manifested in the Board
of Health appointed by Mayor Phelan. In
its extreme anxiety to carry out the ante
election promises made by his Honor it
has even directed Its eagle eye to the
minor positions of steward and day
watchman of the Twenty-sixth street
Leper and Smallpox Hospital, now
held respectively by Thomas Reilly
and Isaac Wallard. The fact that
there are two aggravated cases of
smallpox at the pesthouse, which Is of
course in a state of strict quarantine, does
not deter the new board from making
places whenever it can find them, though
to throw the two employes, Reilly and
Wallard, out npon the community after
having been in close contact with the con
tagion is nothing short of criminal. The
two men also look after the wants of the
lepers now confined in one corner of the
block on which the pesthouse la situated.
The whole place is under strict quaran
tine.
The fiat went forth, however, after a
dark lantern session of the board held in
the othce of Dr. Bazet on Geary street
last Saturday night. The board met to
nx up a slate or a long list of appoint
ments, and Keilly and Wallard, among
others, were selected for official decapita
tion. Their successors are said to be Pat
rick Keating, steward of the hospital dur
ing the Buud administration, ana William
Kuddick, son of Nurse Kuddick, now em
ployed at the institution. At least both ot
these men have been making their open
boasts that they would be appointed to
the places. Keating especially has been
loud in his assertion that he will get his
old place back, and that possibility haÂ»
caused the determined spurt of opposition
on the part of the leper colony.
Keating made himself so unpopular
when he formerly held the position that
the lepers wrote a communication to
Mayor Phelan requesting him not to dis
charge Reilly, who had been careful of
their comforts and was extremely popu
lar on account of his kindness to them.
The Mayor replied that he would take
the matter under advisement, but the
lepers fear that Keating will be appointed
just the same. Keating recently went out
to the leper hospital and after boasting
of his prospective appointment was round
ly abused by George Pablo, a leper, who
accused him of having absented himself
for three or four days at a time when he
held the position of steward. He left tho
watchmen in charge, and the medicines
were locked up during his absence, so
that the unfortunate lepers were obliged
to go without the remedies necessary in
their unfortunate condition. Pablo also
aacused Keating of other things of a more
or less serious nature and told him that
he and his fellows would do Keating bod
ily harm if he were reappolnted. Keating
was obliged to appeal to Steward Reilly
for protection from the irate Pablo.
Keating's prospective appointment has
thrown the lepers in a state of great ex
citement, and should the programme go
through at the special meeting of the
Healtn Board to be held to-morrow night
there may be interesting developments.
It is understood that Night WatZiman
Welch will remain.

while I know that you performed your
duty courageously and directly without
hope of reward, still I trust that you may
be willing to accept the Inclosed check.
If I can be of any service to you it will
afford me the greatest gratification to bo
able to do so at any time. I inclose copy
of a letter just delivered to the Park
Commissioners on your behalf."

fight we are ready to accommodate
them."
"That will do." said the court. "I want
no rough-and-tumble fight In this court
room. There Is a motion for a continu
ance and I will grant it."

NO CHANGE IN
GRAIN BAG LIMIT
Petitions Denied by the
Prison Directors.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Jan. 22.â The
regular meeting of the State Board ot
Prison Directors took place here to-day.
The principal business to occupy the
board's attention was the petition of R.
Llchtenberg. a member of the Southern
Pacific Milling Company. Liehtenbejrg
stated that he represented the Interests of
700 farmers throughout the State and that
he wished, on their behalf, to ask the
fcoard to reconsider its action In resolving
to limit the amount of grain bags supplied
to any one farmer to 2000. As his reason
tor this he pointed to the fact that the
law places the limit at 5000 grain bags
and the further cut of 3000 was made at
the instance of the board. The board re
fused to grant the Southern Pacific Mill-
Ing Company's request and the future
price of grain bags will be 5.65 per bag.
and the amount supplied will be limited
to 2000 or less. This practically means
that the board is rejecting 700.0U0 orders.
The farmers find that owing to the limited
profit of 1 cent per bag placed on the
prison product by law they can buy bags
cheaper there than in the open market,
hence the great demand for the output
of San Quentin's jute mill.
Warden M. G. Agulrre presented the
following statement of the grain bags and
jute at present on hand at the prison:
Grain bags on hand. 822,000; carried over
on orders from last year, 416,000; sold
since January 1. 1900. 261,0o0; total sold
awaiting shipment, 677,000; on hand, 145,
000; raw jute on hand in warehouses, 3357
bales which will be sufficient to run the
mills till June 1, 1500; contracted for to
arrive, per British ship Euphrosyne now
loading at Calcutta, 7000 bales.
In the report appended to this statement
it is stated that the new gun post over
looking the jute mills is completed and
ready for occupation. The cost of com
pletion came well within the estimate of
$650 presented to the board.
Since the accident in November work
in the jute mill has been resumed with
a force of 700 men. The output is said to
be larger than It has been In any pre
vious year. The average in January, 1593.
was H.OiK), while this year the average to
date is 12.525. .j, ".
The board will meet on the 3d of next
month at Folsom Prison.
KIDNAPING A SCHOONER.
Part Owner of the Fanny Adele Does
Not Want Her to Go A-Sailing.
A. E. Slade filed a libel yesterday In the
United States District Court against the
schooner Fanny Adele and her owners to
enjoin them from taking the schooner on
a voyage away from the bay of San Fran
cisco without giving him proper security
for the return of the schooner. Slade al
leges that he is the owner of eleven
thirty-seconds of the schooner, and that
A. R'lotum, master and manager, Is pre
paring to take her on a voyage "unknown
to the libelant." The schooner is valued
at $10,500, and Slade's share is alleged to
be $3609 22.

CAME TO ADJUST MATTERS.
A Committee of Arizona Trainmen
Confer With J, A. Fillmore.
A grievance committee composed of
trainmen employed on the Arizona divis
ion of the Southern Pacific called on J.
A. Fillmore yesterday to lay before him
the troubles that had brought them from
Tucson to this city.
The matters complained of were small
affairs, involving fines and methods of
routine discipline, to which the company's
employes take exception. The committee
was closeted with Mr. Fillmore for the
best part of the day. and when the confer
ence closed most of the differences had
been satisfactorily adjusted.
Epe.e Randolph, division superintendent
of the Southern Pacific in Arizona, came
up with the men to be present at the
meeting and help his company by advis
ing Mr. Fillmore on matters of detail
with which he. as head of the division in
which the trouble arose, was more fa
miliar.
PEACE NOT YET DECLARED.
Chinese Native Sons Resent the State
ments of a Morning Paper.
The contract which is designed to re
store peace in Chinatown is still in
Marysville awaiting the signature of the
president of the Hop Sing Tong. Much
conjecture is expressed as to whether the
reluctant society will consent to any
amicable settlement, and If it should
whether it would be disregarded, as in
the case of the last declaration of truce.
The police are disinclined to believe that
the warring tongs mean to bury the
hatchet, and will still pursue their vigi
lant methods until they are confident that
murdering in Chinatown has become a
thing of the past. Acting Chief of Police
Biggy declares that He proposes to
teach the highbinders a lesson that they
will never forget, and he will not permit
an empty declaration of a truce to
throw him off his guard.
The compact, which will guarantee to
the police that henceforward all tong.Â«
shall become law-abiding organizations,
has not yet been signed. Negotiation
in the matter is progressing and the po
lice expect good results. A slave girl
named Sing Ho was arrested by Dr.
Gardner in a house on Jackson street last
night and turned over to the. United
States Marshal.
The Chinese Society of Native Sons de
nounces an article which appeared In a
morning paper concerning a circular Is
sued by the Chinese Six Companies in
behalf of its organization a3 a deliberate
misrepresentation. The members claim
that the translation was. not correct and
that the proclamation, instead of being
detrimental to the order, was in favor of
it.

Southern Pacific and Other Corpoaa

Attention From Members
of the Board.
By failing to sign the necessary reso
lutions Mayor Phelan yesterday gained
another week in which to wage his fight
for the absolute control of the patronage
of the Board of Supervisors. The resolu
tion creating the necessary clerkships,
which was passed to print last week, was
yesterday finally passed with no vote
aÃainst it. Instead of signing it and
making it operative, however, his Honor
â¢â¢passed it uj>" and In answer to a point
ed question from Supervisor Reed said
he would sign it to-morrow after It had
come to him in the regular way.
"As it now stands," said Mr. Reed,
"there may be some question over the
ffiirlci of the present force of clerks, as
the T.arter abolished their positions.
Some action should be taken at once."
""As it ttands now," retorted the Mayor,
"the present clerks will get a wnole
month's salary no matter what else hap
pens to them. The resolution will be
Eisned to-morrow or the next day, if
tn^re is no objection."
A resolution by Supervisor D'Ancona,
affecting the purchase of supplies for the
Almshouse, City and County Hospital
and other of the city's charitable institu
tions, created considerable discussion, as
it apparently interfered with contracts
for supplies let by the last board. After
tome argument that point was referred
to the city Attorney tor an opinion and
the resolution passed to print. It pro
vides as follows:

The rest of the resolution provides that
the Hospital and Health Committee shall

The same provisions were ordered with
regard to nun-contract goods, and it is in
this clause that exists the apparent con

which were let for one year.

P Supervisor .Tonin offered an ordinance
rohlbiting bookmaking, poolselling or
siting on any contest, and the attend
nce of any person at any place where
â¢ pools are cold or bets made on contests
or contingent issues. The ordinance pro
posed by Mr. Tobin is drawn on the lines
cf the bill proposed at the last session of
the Legislature, which brought a heavy
lobby of professional gamblers to Sacra
mento bent upon its defeat. It is directed
not only against those who sell pools and
â¢â¢ngage in bookmaking. but as well to
those who buy pools or register bets of
money, or any object representing money
or value, upon any contest or event of
tny description. The ordinance provides
es a penalty a fine of not more than $150
or Imprisonment not to exceed ninety
â¢ days, or both such fine and imprisonment
The ordinance was referred to the Judi

document and requested that before any
action be taken it be referred to the Ju

MILITARY RULE IN ALASKA.
BEPORTS from Washington concerning the
creation of a new military department in Alaska
have naturally given rise to a good deal of dis
cussion, both in military and in political circles. The
department is to be placed under command oi
Colonel Randall, who is to be raised to the grade
of brigadier, in order that he may have rank suitable
to the command, and when the plan has been carried
out Alaska wtll be placed under complete military
In some respect? the report is not unexpected.
There is need 01 considerable military force in Alaska,
for the territory Â« vast, the population contains a
considerable number of lawless adventurers and the
civil authorities are hardly adequate to deal with the
situation. Up to this time the conduct of military af
fairs in the district has been excellent.' AH reports
concerning them, no matter from what source the
reports come, have been highly commendatory of the
manner in which Major Ray, who is now in com
mand, has fulfilled his difficult and arduous duties.
He has maintained order in the district, borne all the
burden of organizing the command during the rush of
gold-seekers and the crowds that have followed them,
and merits the promotion which will doubtless conic
with the erection of the Territory into a military de
partment.
The mam interest in the subject, however, is due to
the belief that military government is to be established
in Alaska by way of making a precedent for similar
governments in Porto Rico and the Philippines. The
Baltimore American, which is usually well informed
of what goes on in Washington, asserts that to be the
case. If it shor'd prove true we will have a very
important issue to face. It is well known the people
of Alaska, as a rule, desire the division of the huge
Territory into two parts and the establishment of a
Territorial form of government in each, as has be-n
done heretofore in the organization of new common
wealths. The proposed military regime will therefore
be in opposition to the wish of the people as well a-,
a radical innovation in our system of government.
It is certain Alaskan affairs will occupy consider
able attention from Congress during the present ses
sion and the full meaning of the new movement in its
military administration will soon be made clear. The
report that it is designed as a precedent for future
colonial governments may be no more than guess
work, but the imperialists have been busy for some
time in endeavoring to devise a form of permanent
sdminirtrstion for the islands they propose to annex
and it is not improbable they have determined to try
the experiment of military rule in Alaska by way of a
test.
HATS FOR TRAVELING.
Of the hats represented the boating hat
Is trimmed with drab taffetas; the other
is of soft velvet, tr'rr.med with a tuft of
black feathers.
Why? Is it because he and his capabilities are well known and approved? No.
The Call ventures to say that. not one of you gentlemen ever knew of his existence be
fore your appointments to the Police Commission were under consideration. He is ut
terly unknown to the vast majority of our citizens. He is young in years and expe
perience. Has any reason been shown why he should be pitchforked into place over the
heads of abler and more experienced men? Let us concede that he has been a fairly
efficient lieutenant. Has he been more than this? Or has he ever, anywhere, under
any circumstances, shown the capabilities which would justify you in placing him in a
position of such vast power for good or evil? We will not even ask you to consider the
pitiful spectacle which he made as a witness before you, but we will ask: What are the
admitted facts in his public career? Two at least:
First â He was dismissed from his position as a guard at San Quentin prison for
insubordination. Does this show a qualification. for discipline and command?
Second â He has been acting as the personal body-guard of A. M. Lawrence,
manager of the Examiner, herein occupying the exalted position left vacant by the mal
odorous Wyatt Earp.
In the light of this last fact we begin to approach the core of the matter. Upon
the appointment of Esola A. M. Lawrence has set his heart. We say A. M. Lawrence,
for the tepid interest ofc. the Examiner's absentee proprietor in things Californian is
scarcely worth noticing. A. M. Lawrence, then, wants Esola for Chief of Police. The
Call has openly charged Mayor Phelan with having been a party to an ante-election con
tract with Lawrence having this end in view. It has declared its willingness to prove
this when called upon, and has invited Mr. Phelan to punish it for libel, if libel it be.
He has shuffled, evaded and taken refuge in cowardly subterfuge, but the fact stands out,
the more clearly disclosed by his conduct, that the gift of the Police Department of San
Francisco to A. M. Lawrence is to be Mr. Phelan'? payment for the Examiner's sup
port. Do you for n moment doubt the truth of this? Ask yourselves why the Examiner
devotes page after page to the espousal of Esola's cause. Is it, think you, a disinterested
support? Consider but for a moment the testimony of Mr. Lawrence given before
you. Ask yourselves why Mr. McEnerney, the regularly retained attorney for the Ex
amirrer, appears as Esola's counsel. Think you. that -Mr. Esola can afford to employ
and pay such talent to advocate his cause?
What, then, does it all mean? Just this: That Esola, an obscure and unproved
man, is to be made Chief of Police of San Francisco by the influence of the Examiner,
manipulated by A. M. Lawrence. Can you face tl\ese facts and blink the conclusion
that the scheme is hot afoot to make the Police Department of San Francisco the tool
and instrument of a designing man, "by merit raised to the bad eminence" of manager
{ of the Examiner?
It seems cruel to*chide Dan Burns for seeking to
control the Police Department. He certainly ought
to know from which direction he may expect the
greatest menace to his interesting operations.
The new Duke of Westminster, now in South
Africa, is undoubtedly, a brave man. He is going to
Lendon to get married.

CONGRESS AND THE CANAL.
GRATIFYING indeed is the report from Wash
ington that a poll of Congress shows a strong
majority in each House in favor of taking im
mediate action upon the Nicaraguan canal bill with
i out waiting for the Walker Commission to make fur
i ther investigations of the various routes. Our dis
' patches state that in the Senate there are sixty-two in
j favor of acting at once, twenty-three who were non
1 committal, or not canvassed, and only one who de
clared for a waiting policy. In the House there ar<?
I 254 for action, twenty-nine for delay and sixty-seven
j non-committal or not canvassed. Thus there is dis
closed in each House an overwhelming majority m
favor of the bill, and it would appear that at last we
I are about to sec the great enterprise undertaken.
The situation is far brighter than was expected
The appointment of the Walker Commission to in
vestigate not only the Nicaragua but the Panama
route, taken in connection with the extraor
dinary activity of the Panama people 4 in mak
ing a campaign of education in favor of that
route, gave ample reason for fearing that noth
ing would be done at this session. In fact, when
Hepburn in the House and Morgan in the Senate
announced that' they would make strenuous efforts to
{ bring about the enactment of the canal bill at once, it
was believed they were but leaders, of a forlorn hope,
and that the utmost they could do would be to force
Congressmen to go on record either for delay or
against it, and thus enable voters to see who were the
true friends of the measure.
The Hepburn bill provides for a canal to be con
structed by the Government and controlled by the
Government. It appropriates money for the work
and clothes the administration with ample power to
go forward as soon as the necessary diplomatic ar
rangements can be effecteU Of course there will not
6e clear sailing even after the bill is enacted, for much
negotiation will be needed to procure from Costa Rica
and Nicaragua the required rights of way for the
canal and points of vantage for its defense. Still the
passage of the act will be a long step toward the ful
fillment of the project, and for that reason the whoie
country will be gratified when it has been accom
plished.

Can you for a moment doubt but that Esola, owing his official existence to that
man, will in all things do his behest? And have you stopped to consider what that
means? If a guilty man is to be acquitted, at a hint the police force is supine, the wit
nesses are scattered, the evidence lost. More horrible still: Is an innocent man to be
convicted â the tremendous pressure of the police is brought to bear, intimidation, coer
cion and falsification are freely employed, until the harassed victim is worn out in the
struggle against overwhelming odds. Nor are these pictures fanciful. You cannot be
ignorant of the venal part which the Examiner played in the prosecution of Richard
Heath for the murder of McWhirter, and, if by chance you are, ask the first citizen you
meet upon the street and he will tell you the black and infamous' tale. Nor is this all. In
.turning the Police Department over to a newspaper â and such a newspaper â you make
it an engine of oppression to the private citizen. You Frenchify our police system^ not
for the Government, but for a private individual, and the pigeonholes of , the Examiner
will be stuffed with secret dossiers such as cursed France in the Dreyfus case, and these
w ill be used as the interest of A. M. Lawrence may dictate. Can you doubt the use
which will be made of them?
Finally: Is it not apparent to you, as it is to the community at large, that an un
known man like Esola under these circumstances will destroy all confidence in your
department, and excite only fear and distrust? Is it not your plain duty to. ap
point a man of independence, integrity and tried capability, who will owe his place to no
newspaper, politician or schemer, but to you, the appointing power alone?
Bear in mind that The Call advocates the claims of no particular man, but it
speaks for the reputable citizens of San Francisco, and, so speaking, urges with all sol
emnity that 3-911 justify your reputations by naming for this all-important office a man
whose selection will restore the confidence of the people, sadly shattered by the happen
ings of the last few days. Surely in all San Francisco such a man may be found, and
surely he is not to be found in the person of F. L. Esola.
A DEFENSE OF ENGLAND.
The Call does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Editor of The Call: Viewing the Eng
lish position in South Africa from the
light the twaddle of "an American Ameri
can" (.save the mark!) sheds upon it in
such sentences as, "England enacts this
wicked tragedy, a crime so appalling, so
reprehensible that words are inadequate
to express the horror and detestation felt
by onlookers, and all for the sake of the
blind and insatiable greed which sur
rounds, permeates and envelops Eng
land like a loathsome malady," one wouU
Imagine that the name of England stood
for everything that is unholy and cor
rupt, whereas, as every fair-minded
man and woman knows, it Is and has
ever been the synonym for liberty, dvMi
zatlon and progress wherever her bright
flag waves. It has been her mission
through the ages to spread the light of
Christianity ana tolerance, and God help
the world should indeed England fall!
The idea of Great Britain, as a nation,
deliberately and In cold blood making war
upon "innocent, puny republics." com
posed of "farmers and shepherds." actu
ated only by motives of avarice and
greed, is so absurd as to be beneath con
tempt.
Further, these same "innocent, puny re
publics" are supposed to "honestly pos
sess that which the greed of the giant
covets." If by an endeavor to annihilate
and enslave the aborigines and seize their
lands the Boer has fulfilled the ideas of
honesty held by "an American Ameri
can." it is regrettable.
These selfsame "innocent farmers and
shepherds" have attempted to do noth
ing toward vindicating their actions in
this respect by helping onward the tri
umphant march of civilization; therefore
the law of "the survival of the fittest"
obtains, and they must make room for
those who will.
It is evident that -Great Britain was far
from anticipating actual warfare with
the so-called South African "republic."
as witnessed by her utter lack of pre
paredness, whereas, on the other hand,
it 1Â» aleo very evident that the "innocent
farmers and shepherds" have been slowly
but surely making tremendous prepara
tions for years to prevent by armed force
the spread of tolerance and enlighten
ment. In other words, they have been
preparing to drive the British from their
colonies, aided and abetted by Russians.
French, Germans and other individuals
whose sympathies seem to lean toward
ignorance and Intolerance.
As for a certain man (whoso name sug
gests "the other side") in comparing Eng
land to Spain he has either a, sneaking
yearning for sensationalism in his com
position or else decided asinine tendencies
Never were two nations more diametrical
ly opposite in their alms. In their meth
ods. In their motives. What has Spain
done for the world other than foater
bigotry and superstition? What has Eng
land done? Everything that tends to
spiead the light of liberty, and reason,
and. please God, so she will continue to
do till the end of time, pedagogues to the
contrary. It is her destiny, and
that of English-speaking peoples the
world over. Why England Is but doing
to-day in South Africa for her own people
what the United States did in Cuba For
an alien race.
Again, the idea advanced by the man
with the liquid name that the British em
pire Is to fall because her "best and brav
est" go forth to vindicate her honor at
this particular time Is ridiculous on the
face of it. Have they not gone forth
through the centuries? Have they not
fallen by thousands on the plains of In
dla, the deserts of Egypt, amid the hor
rors of the Crimea? And dare anyone
say that England has retrograded one lot
or tittle because of this generous out
pouring of the blood of her sons"
Whether this present war be right or
wrong. England can but blindly do her
part toward working out the destiny of
the English-speaking race. She has al
ways done it well.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
CONTROVERSY
Gco. D. Squires' Reply to H- NÂ»
Clement.
The Call do** not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them tor wnatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Editor of The Call: I beg to apologize
for reviving . the discussion concerning
rivil service reform which raged in your
columns two months ago. While It Is
quite true that the subject is an Impor
tant oneâ the new charter provisions be
ing an attempt to permanently reform
our politics by withdrawing the public
patronage of the city from the control of
the practical politiciansâ l am convinced
that no good can come from discussing
Its legal phases In the public press nor
by presenting Its authors with an oppor
tunity to do some ground and lofty tum
bling* explanatory of the lamentable spec
tacle they have made of it.
But being a civil service reformer who
neither seeks an office nor a legal fee, I
am naturally resentful that our tlrst at
tempt to Introduce the merit system into
California should result in bringing the
whole thing Into contempt. Therefore I
have charged Mr. Clement, the avowed
author of the civil service provisions of
the new charter, with Inexcusable negli
gence, and have endeavored to illustrate
to him the inevitable results of his care
lessness. Instead of meeting me with the
humility which becometh a public servant
who has got his constituents into a bad
scrape, he. accuses me. of being a,rrlend
of the "push," and positively declines to
"educate" me in the operation of char
ter civil service reform. I am always
anxious to learn, but 1 fear that I can ob
tain little education from one who re
gards abuse and insinuation as argument,
or who. according to his own averments,
has framed the charter civil service
provisions on the theory that they will
not be resisted by the political machines
and their adherents. m _
My communication of Saturday was in
tended to modestly call your attention to
tne fact that up to date this attempt at
civil service reform has resulted just as
I predicted it would. Mr. Clement said
the "push" would not get in. I told him
they would get in. They are in. I said
the rule prescribing tenure during good
behavior would have to. be abandoned.
Mr. Clement now says he never Intended
to establish any such absurd rule.
Let us see about that. Speaking or the
Supreme Court decisions regarding om
clal tenure, to which I have directed his
attention, he asks: "Do you suppose for
an instant mat the author of the civil
service law was Ignorant of those decis
ions of our Supreme Court?
That is exactly what I suppose, and the
best proof of it is the fact that no pro
vision is made for continuing em
ployes appointed under the. merit system
after the expiration of the term of four
years prescribed by section 16, article XX.
of the constitution. How easy it would
have been to have neutralized this secUon
by requiring the reappointment of ofli
cers who had served faithfully for four
'^YVhen Mr. Clement says that tho force
and value* of civil service reform does not
depend upon life tenure, or tenure dur
ing good behavior, he takes a position
that will be antagonized by every intelli
gent person who has studied the subject.
If the practical politicians aro to be al
lowed to struggle for the places every
four, years instead of every two, of what
avail will merit examinations be? So far
as the new charter system goes, what is
to prevent the "push" combining at an
election and securing the selection of a
Mayor who will appoint a commission
which, through its rules, will let out
every faithful nnd competent employe
and let them in? In other wojds. how la
the local civil service going to be kept
out of politics by the new charter?
The case of Kennedy vs. the Board of
Education, quoted by Mr. Clement, only
affects school teachers. A majority of
the Supremo Court in that case decided
that a person who tenches school does
not hold an "ofllce" within the meaning
of the constitution, but' two Justices dis
sented in opinions in which this doctrine
was vigorously attacked. Indeed. Jus
tice Fox. one of the dissentients, says the
Idea that any person In California can
have a life estate in any public employ
ment is "contrary to the entire spirit and
intent of the constitution and of all the
legislation of the State."
"With all due respect to Mr. Clement I
am of opinion that he never heard of
section 16/ article XX, of the constitu
tion and the court decisions giving it
effect until I called his attention to
them." Had he heard of them it is In
credible that he should have - framed
article XIII of the charter so that the
"push" may' drive a coach and four
through it.
Events having proved that a portion of
my prediction as to the operation of the
merit system under the , charter is true,
and Mr. Clement having : confessed that
the remainder will prove . true, there
seems to be nothing for mo to do except
to hereafter hold my peace. Very re

AN APPEAL TO THE POLICE COMMISSIONERS.
UPON you, Police Commissioners of San Francisco, devolves the extremely im
portant duty of selecting a fitting Chief of the Police Department of our city. You
are men of intelligence, character and standing, and it may be assumed that you
are fully alive to the gravity of your positions.
In this matter, either the full responsibility of selection is yours, or you have con
sented to act as mere puppets at the dictation of the power which appointed you. ' If
the latter is the fact, then you have sacrificed your independence, done violence to your
oaths and outraged your fellow citizens, who have the right to demand that in making
your choice you exercise for them your independent and unbiased judgment',. In this
event words of remonstrance and reason would be utterly wasted.
But. knowing your standing in the community, The Call prefers to believe that
you are independent in fact and upright in intent, and that you would not occupy pub
lic office to serve the ends of any man, nor undertake the performance of a public trust
without the solemn purpose of executing it conscientiously and well.
So believing. The Call invites your attention to certain considerations touching
the proposed appointment of F. L. Esola as Chief of Police of the city and county of
San Francisco. The Call asks you to consider its suggestions in the same dispassionate
spirit in which they are offered, and begs you to remember that in this matter you are
charged with grave judicial powers, and are to a great extent the arbiters of the future
destiny of our city. It will limit its statements to proved or admitted facts, and ask you
to make your determination upon them, and upon them alone.
First, then, who is F. L. Esola? He is a lieutenant of the police force, whom it
is proposed to raise to the head of the department.
SAN FRANCISCO'S POLICE DEAL IS
THE WORST SCANDAL IN HER HISTORY
Scathing Comments Made by the Interior Press on the
Conspirators Who Would Sell the
Department.
Cordelia fS. Ray.
Mayor Phelan of San Francisco seems to be "up rffcalnst It.**' The Call of
last Tuesday devoted a full page in exposing him to having bargained to s?ell the
Police Department to the criminal elements of that city. If the statements made
by The Call are untrue Mayor Phelan has an excellent chance to bring suit for
libel. If he does not do so he is guilty and stands disgraced, which should result
in the forfeiture of his high office. â¢
'V.';'. " * * *
Stockton Independent.
The Esola incident is a fine opportunity for such Democratic organs as have
been "off" to square themselves with Mr. Phelan and the Examiner. No doubt
longer exists that I'helan is the Democratic warhorse of the State and that the
Examiner is his monitor. Mr. Phelan has run up against an exposure of his
method of trading off the Police Department to Lawrence. It is a body blow for
one who is posing as a political purist. He needs loyal support and valiant de
fenders. It is the first opening for the faction in the Democratic oarty that has
been slurring him to atone for past misdeeds, and consequently the Democratic
press of the State Is crawling up behind leader Phelan. Esola will be selected
as Chief because he was slated and It will be made a party question, a test of
Democratic fidelity.

St. Helena Sentinel.
A fierce war Is going on In San Francisco over the appointment of Chief of
Police. The Call Tuesday made some very serious charges against the Mayor,
which will cause some bitter feelings in the metropolis. The charges if not true
should be refuted In the courts, as recent laws passed by the Legislature give a
person attacked by a newspaper all the advantage that could be desired. We are
sorry that such a stale of affairs should exist In San Francisco, where the peo
ple have recently adopted a new charter by which it was thought that corrupt
methods would "be Impossible. The Call's charges if true would indicate that
the political methods of San Francisco have not been improved upon.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Santa Barbara Press.
San Francisco is beginning her career under the new charter, from which so
much was expected, anything but auspiciously. In that city of political infamy
the moat disgraceful scandal in her history is now tearing the metropolis asun
der and exposing a wretched and disgusting condition of municipal affairs. The
leading candidate for Chief of Police is openly accused of Incompetency and dis
honorable discharge from a position of trust formerly held at the San Quentln
prison. Mayor Phelan is publicly branded a felon. In violating the statutes and
selling the position of Chief of Police to the Examiner for political support. The
Call boldly makes the charge, and invites the Mayor to bring suit for libel.
Whether or not one-half of the charges are true, it is evident that the thorough
housecleanlng In progress In San Francisco's City Hall 13 needed; though It
may be inconvenient and uncomfortable for all concerned.

Sonoma Index-Tribune.
Mayor Phelan of San Francisco has evidently had his head turned since as
suming office under the new charter. At a recent banquet, in which he was the
central figure, he defied and reviled the press and said he would lead and the
newspapers could follow. The metropolitan newspapers, if we except the Exam
iner, are up in arms against him. and not without good cause, and we pre
dict that it will not be long before It Joins forces with The Call. Bulletin and
Chronicle In taking some of the conceit out of his Highness. Mayor Phelan
will discover when it Is too late that he has "got his foot in it' in antagonizing
the press of the metropolis, and before the newspapers get through with him
he will realize to his sorrow that he has made the biggest mistake of hU life
in reviling the press, which has made him what he Is to-day.
The San Francisco Call has made and reiterated the charge that Mayor Phe
lan of that city entered Into a corrupt contract prior to the last election with the
purpose of securing support for Ma candidacy, and that under the law ho Is
guilty of a felony. If this accusation be true the Mayor should serve a term in
prison; if it be untrue, Mr. Phelan certainly owes it to himself and to the city
whose executive he is to vindicate his character. Moreover, If he be falsely ac
cused the very nature of 'the case gives him as adequate a remedy as he coutd
desire. If innocent, he has an ample opportunity to obtain the most complete
vindication, and incidentally to punish his accuser. It is simply a question of
fact, and should Mr. Phelan seek to vindicate himself by a libel suitâ as The Call
has repeatedly challenged him to doâ tne burden would be upon the paper to
prove its charges, not upon Mr. Phelan to show his Innocence.
But Mr. Phelan firmly declines the test. He has issued a partial denial, drag
ging In various extraneous matters, but he refuses to meet his accuser in court
and place upon him the alternative of convicting the Mayor of felony or belr.g
mulcted in damages. It may be said that men are not bound to sue for libel to
defend their reputations. As a general proposition this is true. But when a man
occupying so high an official position as the Mayor of the city of San Francisto
is daily accused of felony, decent regarrl for the people and for the good name of
the city certainly demands that he takf* every possible step to vindicate himself.
Mr Phelan has long posed as a political puristâ a man whom the office sought,
the friend and champion of the plain people. He may be all that still. But unleas
he clears himself of these charges th? average citizen will be very apt to regard
him as a thoroughly corrupt politician who has been finally unmasked.

is no rule that requires that one should
pay for the other. It is common cour

happens that the two offer the fare at

should try to force the fare on the con

JEAN LOUIS ERNEST MEIPSONIER.
tion not held since the days of the old
masters of history, and not excelled even
by them. A stocky man. exceeding short
of stature, an enormous head, full of
wavy, curling hair, a great beard that
reached half-way down to his feet, a
splendid, resolute face â these were the
striking characteristics of the famous
draughtsman, master of detail and com
position, analytical worker and altogether
remarkable maker of pictures. He was a
well-known figure in the streets of Paris,
a potent personality in the art world, and
all in all one of the most wonderful men
of the century.
Meissonier was born at Lyons in ISl.">,
on the 20th of February, but his family
went to Paris when he was 3 years of
age. At the time of his birth his father
was a successful merchant in drugs, but
he shortly met with reverses and was
obliged to practice great economy. The
mother was an artistic woman, said to
have had, in an amateur way, considera.
ble talent, dying, however, when the boy
was but 11 years of age. Thereafter he
went to live with relatives at GrenoMo.
His yearnings for art naturally manifest
ed themselves very early. There Is a
school report In existence, made by ot:e
of the masters of the Lycee Charlemagi>\
where Ernest was a seventh-form boy in
IS21 â he was then 9 years oldâ wherein
the following observation occurs: "Er
nest has a very marked taste for iraw-
Ins; the very sight of a picture will ofttn
make him neglect his appointed studies.'
But his father had little desire to encour
age the boy. for. like some more modern
parents, the profession of the fine arts
seemed to him to be but trifling at the
best, and he was desirous of bringing
up his son in the drug business, at which
the boy's heart rebelled. In 1532 he was.
In point of fact, apprenticed to a chem
ist. Discontent, if not open rebellion, en
sued, and the boy's father so far relentod
as to give him eight days In which to find
a master who would vouch for his having
ability enough to warrant his parent
starting him on an art career.
Taking such drawings as he had made
in his odd moments, he started In on the
important question to. meet with most
disheartening rebuffs, for the first men
whom he encountered were embittered
souls, of only mediocre i talent, who
cursed the fate that had drawn them Into
art. Finally he found one Jules Potler.
tb whom he showed a drawing and who
immediately consented to take him as a
pupil. For a whole winter he worked
with him. He had an allowance of 10
cents a day for his meals, and he dined
with his father every Wednesday, when
the members of his family met. After a
time Potler, for whom he had done some
drawings that had sold, took him to
Leon Cognlet. who had a class*, and paid
his fees in advance for five months. But
Meissonier had no use for Cogniet. He
saw him twice only and then left the
place. In the salon of 1534 he exhibited
his first picture. It was called "A Visit
to the Burgomaster," and was bought by
the "Societe dcs Amis dcs Arts" for 100
francs, a respectable price in those days.
He had sent one other picture, however,
called "A Little Messenger," which was
rejected and subsequently purchased by
his own father, who now began to have
a fair amount of respect for his son's
talent.
In short, Meissonier's father was now
so impressed that he made him an allow
ance of 100 francs a month with which he
was to go to Rome to study. It wrs ar
ranged that he should stop at Grenoble
on the way to paint two portraits for. his
father. When these were finished the
cholera had broken out and he got no
farther than Lyons, where he stayed a
year. On his return to Paris, although
his father furnished him with a studio,
he had to look about to make a liveli
hood, and so it was he went in for Illus
trative work, wherein he made a remark
able success, his two most important
works being "Paul et Vlrginle" and "La
Chaumiere Indlenne." It will, of course,
be understood that he drew on the block,
and his work created a sensation Imme
diately, since It was quite superior to the
dry, hard and unsympathetic material
that was then being- turned out. These
were In IS3S. He illustrated many other
books, and. having gotten on fairly well,
the same year he married. ;-â¢..-Â¦Â«=
From the beginning of his career Meis
sonler developed" that great attention to
detail that has always been one of hi*
most remarkable characteristics. No prep
aration or study was too severe to enable
him to attain the desired end. He made
the most exhaustive research, pored over
documents in the libraries until his data
Â¦were lncontestably authentic. One may
see this all through his career. Later,
when he came to paint Napoleon, there
was no detail of the time or the costume

In 1555 he painted a famous picture of
a brawl nmonp: snm? cavaliers, called "La

by the Queen of England. It in remark
able for its action, its detail and the real
ism of the composition. A list of his pic
tures, however, would fill more than a col
umn of this paper. They are always small
and generally of men in interiors. Occa
sionally he painted out of doors, and hi 3
studies of horses are among the best ever
done, for he made himself complete mas
ter of the animal, familiarizing himself
with the drawing and anatomy until no
one excelled him. During h!3 life h!s pic
tures brought him enormous prices, and
since he has died their value has in
creased. It is no exaggeration to say
that his panels are worth more than their
weight !n gold, though this signifies lit
tle, since they are so small, as a rule.
Little panels on wood, six inches square,
have sold for many thousand dollars at
public auction, and whenever there is
anything by the man announced for sale
there Is always a scramble to obtain pos
session of the picture.
A great German art writer once said of
him:
Precious without originality. Intellljt^nt with
out lmacination. 'lexterrus without verve, tle-
Kant without charm, refined anil subtle without
delicacy, Meissonier ha* all the qualities that
lntore?t and none of thos* that lay hold of
one. He was a painter of a distinctness which
causes astonishment, but' not admiration; not
an artist for epicures, but for those of the sec
ond order, who pay the more highly for works
of art In proportion as they value their artl
flct.
This to a certain extent Is all true. Yet
the man will be accorded a high place
when the perspective of time will permit
an unbiased opinion of his talents. His
drawing was remarkable; his color was
just and attractive: his compositions were
of astonishing completeness, and hia
choice of subject was always interesting.
Surely these are many qualities to en
compass, in one's work, and a man who
possesses so many of them can only be
regarded as a great artist, despite cer
tain lackinffs. for it is given to only a
few to be absolutely perfect in their art.

FIRE MARSHAL
INVESTIGATES A
PECULIAR FIRE
Mission Street Saloon
in Flames.
DISCOVERED BY A PASSER-BY
Â»
IT WAS UNDER THE CHARGE
OF A DEPUTY SHERIFF.
Suspicious Circumstances Connected
With Its Insurance and Sale of
a Half Interest â Believed
to Be Incendiary.
An Incendiary tire j n j Re sa j O on and
lodging house at 527 Mission street short
ly aftvr midnight yesterday morning is
being investigated by Fire Marshal Towe.
A still alarm was turned In to Chemical
Kngine No. 1 and the flames were soon
extinguished. An investigation showed
that a hole had been cut. in the floor of
the saloon close to a partition and the
fire started there. A passer-by hap
pened to see the flames and at once gave
the alarm.
' The saloon and lodging house were oc
! cupied by L. W. Seliner and his son-in-
I law, J. Kohrer. Seliner came from
j Stockton about three months ago. J. J.
j Griffiths, a recent arrival from Sacra-
J memo, wa* induced to give J^X) to Rohrer
j for his half interest in the business, and
j now claims tluit false representations
were made to him to the effect that the
business was paying and there were no
j debts. He says he learned that Seliner
' had been giving men money to spend in
I the saloon so as to carry out the Idea
j that the business was paying. Frank
Martin, a cook, told him he had Been
given money for that purpose, and later
Martin repeated the statement to the
Fire Marshal. The sale to Griffiths was
made through M. Less; a real estate
dealer, and Attorney Nagle. Seliner also
offered to seii his interest to Griffiths for
j:j<)o and Griffiths went to Sacramento to
get the money, but fortunately for him
the transaction was not consummated.
On Saturday the furniture in the lodg
ing-house and in the roar rooms of the
j saloon was attached by the Sheriff to
i satisfy the claims of creditors, and re-
I moved. A Deputy Sheriff was placed in
charge of the premises. On Sunday night
about 8 o'clock he closed the place with a
Sheriff's lock and went away. No one had
access to the premises, and who started
the fire is a mystery.
The Fire Marshal learned that Sellner
had an insurance of $100") on stock and fix
tures in the saloon and on the furniture in
the lodging;-hous<\ which was far in ex
cess of their value. He was also informed
by the Deputy Sheriff that he paw Seliner
sro down to the basement before he left
the place on Sunday nigrht. The Fire Mar
shal sent for Seliner. but he denied the
assertion of the deputy and said he was in
his house at 3CS Sixth street from T p. m.
Sunday nlpht till 8 o'clock yesterday
morning:. He also claimed that he had
spent considerable money in refitting the
saloon and that the transaction with Grif
fiths was legitimate.
"I am satisfied." said the Fire Marshal
yesterday. "that Griffiths hai? been the
victim ot a bunko game, and he oupht to
be thankful that he did not pay the other
S3X*. You could not get a cent from the
insuranoe company, as the policy became
invalid when the property was taken pos
session of by the Sheriff. If I had another
witness who would swear that he saw
you po ilown to the basement Sunday
nieht I would at once arrost you."
Sellner was told to go. but the Investi
gation is not yet concluded. The Fire
Marshal will interview Rohrer. Seliner's
pon-in-la\v. Tho loss was about $25 on the
buildinc an<l about $50 on stock. The stock
was not worth $10rt.

CHARITY WILL GET
HIS VAST ESTATE
Captain Friedman Bequeathed a Large
Sum to the Hebrew
Home.
WHEN the will of Captain J. Friedman, who. died in the Palace Hotel
Sunday morning. Is opene.i It will be found that of an estate valued
at JTTiO.OOO three-quarters has been bequeathed to charity. After be
quests which will, reach an aggregate of $500,000 are paid, the residue
is bequeathed to the Hebrew Home for Aged Disabled. This is a legacy of at
least $200,000. and speaks for the charity and munificence of the dead capi
talist.
Very few conditions are attached to this bequest. Captain' Friedman re
quests that the directors of the Hebrew Home for the Aged Disabled, now
situated at 507 Lombard street, be sold and a handsome home and hospital be
erected, either in San Francisco or San Mateo county. This will no doubt
be done. The testator asks for no special remembrance other than a place t-r
rest his ashes somewhere on the grounds of the new home, with an inscrip
tion as simple and plain as can mark a grave. He also desires to be burled
without formal religious ceremony. -
The will names as executors William Alvord of the California Bank," Ed
ward Lande, attorney, and I. M. FrÂ«edberg. ' It is a remarkable testament, in
that every eleemosynary Institution of San Francisco Is remembered, and
many In foreign' countries. No .distinction ia made as to race, color or relig
ion. Negro benevolent societies and Chinese charitable organizations are men
tioned as well as the orphan asylums and homes for the aged poor of the
wnite race. /
Ab far as known. Captain Friedman left no relatives, of near or remote
degree. His friends, some of whom have been Intimately associated with
the deceased for the last fifteen years, declare that the captain had not a
relative on earth. The story of a wife by contract marriage Is likewise de
nied, no .mention of this Incident ever having been heard before. To several,
of his close friends Captain Friedman has left legacies of varying amounts.
The big bequest oX $250,000 to the Hebrew Home will make it one of the
wealthiest in the country. Inserted In this part of the will Is a clause of re
quest by the donor, who does not wish the name of the Institution changed
nor any building to be named after him. He says that the Institution Itself
Is a sufficient monument to attest the spirit of charity in which the gift was
made. The will will be filed to-daly. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢

Forecaster at the Washington Weath
er Bureau Thrown From His
:i- Bicycle.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.-Henry A.
Hazen, professor of meteorology and a
forecaster at the Weather Bureau in this
city, was probably fatally injured to-nignt
by being thrown from his bicycle. Ti:c
accident occurred while the professor was
on his way to the bureau. At the corner
of Sixteenth and M streets he ran into a
colored man, the force of the contact
throwing him from the wheel and pitch
ing him forward on his head. The blow
was a terrific one, the skull being cracke.i
from over the nose to the back of the
head, and causing also a hemorrhage of
the brain. Physicians afterward trephined
the skull and removed a large ciot of
blood from the right side. They say the
injuryis one of the most severe on record
and the chances for, recovery are very n>
mote. vi
Professor Hazen was for some time an

TEACHERS WIN A SUIT.
Injunction Issued at the Instancs of

Wells is at liberty to favorably pass upon

solved the preliminary injunction issued
against Auditor Wells at the Instance of

holds that certain provisions of the agree

may audit the demands of the teachers

await the arrival of new funds or appeal
from Judge Murasky's judgment and try
to force a -compromise with the opposing

JULS BANDMANN
DROPS DEAD IN
HIS BATHROOM
A Well-Known Mer
chant Is Stricken.
Juls Bandmann, the well-known pionf-er
and merchant, dropped dead at his home,
25C0 Van Ness avenue, at 8:45 o'clock last
night. Mr. Bandmann was unusually ro
bust in appearance and enjoyed the bÂ«st
of health, with the exception of an occa
sional attack of dizziness, which he ct
tfibuted to a torpid liver but by no means
regarded seriously. He was in the best of
spirits at dinner time and ate a hearty
meal. It was his custom to take a bnth
before retiring, and he had gone to the
bathroom on the second floor for that pur
pose when the maid servant heard a
heavy fall, and rushing to the room foun'l
Mr. Bandmann gasping on the floor. Mrs.
Bandmann was walking up and down the
sidewalk in front of the house when tne
screams of the servant told her that
something was amiss. Her husband
breathed his last a few seconds after she
reached the scene, not having epoker; a
word after he fell to the floor. Dr. Myers,
the family physician, had been summoned,
but all "was over when he arrived.
Juls Bandmann w.as born in Hamburg,
Germany, July. 24, 1829, his father being
a wealthy merchant in that city. In 1549,
when the rush to the California fields be
gan, young Bandmann was about to start
for the Pacific Coast on a hunting trip.
His-brother suggested that he take along
a shipload of merchandise to pay ex
penses, which he did. The profits on the
first cargo were so enormous that he de
cided to remain in San Francisco for a
year or so. He sent for another ship
load of goods and settled down to busi
ness in earnest. In 1566 he sold all hia
real entate in San Francisco and was
making his final preparations to return
to his native country when he received
a letter from his brother In Hamburg re
questing him to .remain here and take
out patents in this country for the manu
facture of dynamite, then a new dis
covery, in which he was interested. Mr.
Bandmann became the first manufac
turer of high explosives on the coast, and
gradually gave up the idea of returning
to Germany. He continued in business in
this city for nearly half a century, being
senior member of the firm of Bandmann,
Nielsen & Co. until about three or four
years ago, when he retired from active
business, although at the time of his
death he was interested in mines In
Mexico, British Columbia and Nevada
County, this State. Mr. Bandmann was
a member of San Francisco's first Fire
Department and one of the founders of
the original Olympic Club. He was an
athlete and a magnificent specimen of
manhood.
Mr. Bandmann was married in 1563 to
Miss Antonla Pollard, by whom he had
two children. His daughter died several
years ago and Charles J. Bandmann of
this city is the only surviving child. Mrs.
Bandmann has recently recovered from a
protracted illness and the shock of her
husband's death has prostrated her.

town Merchants.
Joseph H. Morrison, an old and well
known resident of this city, died suddenly
yesterday afternoon while walking down
the stairs of his daughter's residence at
1437 Jackson street. Mr. Morrison was

claimed by death and his birthday was to

place some lifteen years ago and received
severe injuries, from which, however, he
rapidly recovered. He had been in the
best of health up to the time of his taking

children to be watchful of him, as old age
was causing a rapid weakening of his con
stitution.

Mass.. and came to this city in 1849. He
immediately engaged in the draying busi
ness, which he extended until it had as
sumed large proportions. He acquired
quite a competency and retired from busi
ness ten years ago. He was well and fa
vorably known in the downtown whole
sale district and his death will occasion
much regret among the merchants
who knew him in the old days when the
water came up to Montgomery street.
Among his familiars he was known by the
sobriquet of "Honest Joe."
Mr. Morrison's wife died fifteen years
ago. but he leaves several children. His
eldest son, Joseph ,R. Morrison, is secre
tary of the California Glue Works. Sam
uel L. is another son, and his daughters
are Mcs. J. J. Byron, Mrs. Charles Bauer,
Mrs. J. J. Solomon and Miss Fannie Mor
rison. The funeral will take place to
morrow from 1137 Jackson street.

where he died yesterday morning in his
berth. When the overland reached this
city the remains were removed to an un
dci taking establishment to await orders
from Bridgeport. Mr. Mills had intended

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Jan. 22â The clock market
ehoâ -ed continued indifference on the part of
th* puW'c and even of professtona! speculators
to-day. Net changes in prices are without any
ri*~SflcanoÂ«Â» as bearing on the condition of
fouÂ«SnÂ«"*s or affairs. There was some show
of Mrenirth In the local traction group which
may be attributed to a covering demand from
the short interest. Notwithstanding the better
feeling reported In London on account of pro
k Â¦Â¦ â raid to be making in the accotnpllÃh
tnent of the British plan of campaign the
nr.jrliKh financial public showed no disposition
to pay her i>ricÂ»Â»s for American securities. As
fioon i.c prlc^a were lifted in this market sell-
Ing orders for London account were executed
In the leading international stocks. This
â¢^emed to discourage any further operations
for a rise and prices drifted back near Satur
day's ckaing lÂ»-vel and oscillated very feebly
from that level for the rest of the day. What
ever Â«p*culativf> disposition was current seemed
to be divided between the cotton and wheat
markets where there was some show of ani
mation and considerable strength reflected from
foretjâ , markets. While the market was thus
listless the undertone we* firm and whatever
l Â¦.. * >-' There was was attributed to covering
t>>- a latrpe outstanding short interest. There
â aa n<Â» further marked change in the rates
Tor money to-day. A further drop In sterling
exchange rates marked the continued relaxa
tion In the money situation abroad as well
_s here. The factors making toward greater
Â«.r* liable to seem interrupted
et no vÂ»ry distant |>eriod. The money coming
fror- the rub-treasury Is due In part to heavy
disbursements for pension payments, which are
now about completed for the present period.
The deposit of internal revenue collections In
depository banks cannot be Indefinitely pro
longed for lark of government bonds at se
curity. If the drain from the banka Into the
Â¦Ã¼b-treasury by reason of the taking up of
purplus revenues in resumed the present rate
cf return from the Interior will scarcely be
rufneient to offset it. ThU Is a remote con
tingency at present, but It plays some part in
the eluirgishneta of the money market.
The bond market was not so active as during
the latter imrt of last week, but etlll over
shadowed the market for stocks. The forced
liquidation last fall <!ld not at any time affect
the hlch-rrade Investment bonds and they are
not affected by the present upward movement.
Such middle, lower-grade bonds which were
bought to realize on are now in large demand
and art- steadily advancing in price on a large
at*orpt!on. Total sales, par value. $3,180,000.

The New York Commercial say.:
"The prune situation Is unchanged. There
is plenty of small buying, but the large orders
exp*>ctf<s at this season have not Appeared,
and there are no present Indications leading j
one to think they will come Jor some time yet. 1
Holders en the Coast are firm, and refuse to
consider anything but a 3Â»Â»c basis In bags
lor the four sires, or 3c if they are permitted ]
to put in a <juatit!ty Of Â«J-Â£0Â». It is expected (
that sales will be large later. It would only
take email concessions on both sides to liven 1
ui> trade and brUig big orders.
â¢'I'eaehee appear to be quiet again, after a
tew days of brisk buying, chiefly for Phila
delphia and Western markets. It Is prob
able that a considerable proportion of those
left in first hands passed to jobbers or specu
lators last uÂ«*?k, but this is unconfirmed and
may possibly be only a rumor.
â¢'Raisins are LnciiÂ£.r.ged. Trade is email
and price* barely nominal. Seeders are taking j
a few. but the quantity is too email to exert '
any influence on the market. Foreign goods ;
are dull and buying limited to small consump- |
tive orders. Holders are firm in their views |
and reius*? to make concessions, though a
Blight reduction in price would cause heavy
buying."

wheat would have to be Imported to relieve
the famine In India. Whtat opened %@%c

the principal buyers. On free realizing of
profits by traders the advance was lost. May
sinking to 66% c. May closed firm, %c over
Saturday at 66% c.

occasioned by the strength" of wheat, the

NEW YORK, Jan. 22.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here are Idly waiting news of a
decisive victory In South Africa. There was
to-day a continued advance In consols, which
touched 102>i. They are apparently being
worked for purposes of the forthcoming war
loan. Home rails were notably flat on dls
apjxiinting dividend announcements, due to the
high price of coal and dear materials gener
ally. One speculative favorite fell several
points. American securities were absolutely
listless, but brokers complain that they cannot
fill New York orders for good business, for
European markets have been swept bare of
them. The Bank of England bought Â£36,000
rold in German coin. Foreign exchange rates
are as follows: Paris cheque, 25.19; Berlin,
20.49. It Is expected that the Berlin bank rate
will soon be reduced. Silver was strong on
the closing bear commitments and the Indian
demand. '

Buried Opium Found.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN QUENTTN PRISON, Jan. 22.â The
first "dope" planted here since Warden
Aguirre's regime was found yesterday
afternoon. The Warden was inspecting
the work of the convicts along the Tlbu
ron boulevard, and near the end of the
San Quentin section his attention was at
tracted by a piece of board with a stone
on top. On investigation this proved to
be a dope cache. Snugly fitted Into the
ground beneath the board were several
pounds of the deadly stuff packed in a
Hat wrapping of heavy tinfoil to enab'e
the convicts to carry them easily in their
mouths.
The opium must have been planted sev
eral months ago, as no men have worked
on this section of the road since last
August. The improvement in the ap
pearance of the fiends, since Aguirre took
the reins of the prison is remarkable, and
yesterday's find probably removes the
last of the plants.

VANDAL JAMES
OFFERS INSULT
TO SHERIDAN
Mile. Trebelli Heard in
Concert.
â¢THE QUEEN'S LACE EANDKEE
CHIEF'' AT THE GRAND.
*
Ihe Alcazar Changes to "Lord Chum
ley" â New Attractions at the
Orpheum â "Idol's Eye*' Up
for a Run.
â¢The School for Scandal" is interesting
under ar.y circumstances, even when we
i>eÂ« it after a year performed by practical
ly the same company that appeared
in :t at its last presentation.
Warde is abÂ«=ent and he is missed,
for while his Joseph Surface was
a certain intelligence which is lacking in
the dull and colorless acting of Mr. Han
ford, the incumbent. He is without the
address and subtlety that the part de
mands, and the flatness of his perform
ance is so utterly unrelieved by even a
suggestion of intelligent purpose that no
or.c seeing Sheridan's classic comedy for
the lirst time with Mr. Ilanford in the
part of Joseph Surface could be blamed
for not realizing its possibilities in the
hands of a capable actor.
The Importance 01 "The School for
Scandal" lies chief.y in its brilliancy, the
adroitness of its linvs and the force of its
â¢satire; but it possesses another character
which renders it important, and that is
its character as a comedy of manners. It
introduces us into the atmosphere of the
last century and frcm It we may Â»;lean
knowledge of the manners and customs
of the time.
When the play was produced here a
y^ar ago, with Mr. Jamt-s in the part of
Charies Surface. I commented similarly on
the production and indicted Mr. James In
es direct a manner as possible for pervert
ing the play in an inoxcusable degree. He
has undoubtedly been accused of the same
thing by many others, yet he persists in
:.:s rmaulina and makes of Charles Sur
face not the seventeenth century blade
that he was. but a sort of Peter Daly type
cl r.asty Americanism.
If the public be better pleased by these
i:p-to-date mannerisms it is not the less
a crime against art to cater to its bad
taste. As Sheridan would not have said,
"Mr. James is "off his trolley.' "
Miss Kidder has not altered as La.dy
Tf azie. She is not a success in comedy,
for her flippancy of voice and action does
rot carry with it charm and fascination.
She has the Ellen Terry skip in an aggra
vated form, but however lithe and grace
ful ehe may be the true spirit of gayety
iÂ« not there and her affected coyness is
not r>-al. The arraignment of Joseph by
Lady T"ea*lÂ« calls for the qualities in
which Mi?s Kidder excels, asd therem she
c.i: plays the only touch of true art In her
whole performance. It Is a touch that is
felt; a touch that tells and shows the
Eirt-sgth that is In her.
Miss Kidder's promise of jrreatness lies
all toward serious work, and it is only a
question of time I think before both ehe
Jajid the rubiie will realize that fact.
The company has much merit, and but
for the intrusion of Mr. James' modern
]e*-r find EwairFT the performance has a
deUcbtfsl atmosphere of verity. Mr.
I^r.gdon is particularly good as Sir
l'Â«nÂ«-r. whirh is a part that might easily
be made stupid. PORTER GARNETT. "
Grand Opera-House.
The company at ihf Grand Opera-houso
found ample opportunity to display its
talents last evening in Strauss' ever popu
lar comic opera. "The Queen's Lace
Handkerchief." The opera was ha.id
t-ome.ly costumed and splendidly staged.
Krfith ilÂ«Â«>f! waÂ» a frtrhlnjr Don Prene
and Hattic Belle Ladd a stunning King of
Portugal. Pers=s=<> took splendid care of
Cervantei and William Wolff was excel
lent as the Prime Minister.
An addition to the cast was Miss Etta
<"u!hreth. promoted from the chorus to
assume the responsibilities of the Queen
of Portugal. Barring a painful nervous
next the debutante did some very good
work, and It is probable that the chorus
will know her no more.
Excellent as the principals were, the
preatost praise is due to the chorus. Their
last number in the second act won for
them Jive encores and necessitated Ibm
raising of the final curtain three times.
Tivoli.
Or.c of the largest audiences ever seen
in the Tivcli Opera-house was present last
night to enjoy the spirited performance
cf the comic optra "The Idol's Eye," and
the second wetrk of the euccess promises
to be as large as the first. Ferris Hart
rr.an. Alf C. Wheelan and William Schu*
t*>r again created much laughter in the
funny scenes in the play, while the de
lightful singing of Anna Llchter. Tom
Greene, Annie Meyers and Frances Gra
ham and th*> effective work of the chorus
won frequent applause from the audience
fend demands lor many encores.
Alcazar.
The programme called it "a character
comedy in three acts," and it was in
three acts, but there may be a difference
cf opinion as to "Lord Chumley" being a
comedy, or of any character at all, even
if David Bela-sco and Henry C. De Mllle
wrote it. The lir.st act is a melodramaâ a
complete one, all but the wind-up; the
second act is a farce, and the third is a
disappointment and a pain. The play
drlbbies, and dribbles away, until there
is nothing left for the drop curtain to do
but to ke<Â»p the audience from dislocating
their javrj with a sleepy yawn.
The character and drollery of the piece
are furnished by Ernest Hastings, who
displays a Ftaccato horselaugh that is in
fectious. Mr. Walton's "Butterworth" is
a fair piece of character, and Howard
Scott portrays the villain well as Ga?pard
L* Sage. &larie f Howe and Juliet Crosby
make the most of the too obviously
studied humor in their roles. But the
actors should not be blamed, for the dia
log-ue of the play is as flat and insipid
as any two men could write if they tried
to do "their best at being inane.
Orpheum.
Admirers of vaudeville will find one of
the best performances ever presented at
the Orpheum in this week's bill. The dra
rr.atic comedy, "Tactics," in which James
O, Harrows plays a former colonel of tha
<'ivil War, was greeted with loud ap
plause, and his narrative of the reminis
cent battle scene at Gettysburg, assisted
by his old-time antagonist. General Drum
mond (Brandon Mitchel), a retired vet
eran of the Union army, was thrilling as
well as amusing. The representation of
the various general* who participated, to
eether with their divisions, by means of
:./::;Â¦- and other bric-a-brac was ludicrous
In the extreme. Joseph Newman. In his
eriglnal humorous songs, caught the audf
Â«-nce at once, and without trying very

GENTLEMANLY
HIGHWAYMEN
IN OAKLAND
Aristocratic Footpads
Abroad.
ACCOST VICTIMS POLITELY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Jan. 22.
Two gentlemanly highwaymen have
made their appearance in Oakland. They
obey the curfew law and frequent the
aristocratic portion of the city. Both
knights of the mask are appareled in the
latest London styles, have Chesterfieldian
manners and use the most elegant lan
guage when holding up their victims.
Floyd Brock, a prominent young mem
ber of the Reliance Club, who resides at
145S Broadway, is the first individual to
report a meeting with them. The stop
page occurred at 7:30 o'clock last night on
Twentieth street, between Telegraph av
enue and Broadway. The young man was
just going to dinner, when the two swell
bandits stepped forth from the dark
shadow of a large tree. Each one of the
highwaymen wore a black mask and dis
played a large revolver.
"Kindly hold up your hands," said one
of the robbers, as he thrust his weapon
close to the head of young Brock.
"Yes, please do," remarked the other
social highwayman, "for I do hate blood
shed, and my friend here is a most san
guinary person and is liable to shoot on
the slightest provocation. I have repeat
edly tried to wean him from this un
natural thir-st for blood, but my endeavors
have been futile."
Brock has quite a reputation as an
amateur boxer, but he refused to spar
with a pair of guns. His hands went into
the air to the uppermost limit of his
reach. Then a revolver was placed
against each of his ears and the holders
of the weapons dexterously went through
the pockets of their vicUm. They secured
EJ and a cheap watch.
"It would ruin our standing in society
if we wore such a poor timepiece as
that," said one of the aristocratic thieves.
"It would ruin us irretrievably," re
sponded his companion.
Then they handed the watch back to the
affrighted owner. He was told to put it
in his pocket and go, with an admonition
not to turn aroundl Brock complied with
the order and speedily sprinted for home.
A few minutes later he reported the oc
currence to the police.
. "They were dressed nut of sight." he
told Captain Peterson, "and were quiet
and polite in their commands. Both were
young fellows and were masked. Beyond
that I can't tell much about them, for I
was pretty badly scared. They were cool
and acted as though they were used to the
business of holding pe<Tple up."
The police kept the affair quiet until to
day, because they wore at tirst doubtful
of the authenticity of the story. They
are now convinced of its correctness and
are working strenuously for some clew to
the robbers. As yet they have nothing on
which to work. Several of the officers,
however, are of the opinion that the job
was a practical JokÂ« perpetuated by a
couple of friends of Brock.
MRS. GLEASON
NOW IN FAVOR
OF FEDERATION
Elected an Officer
Temporarily.
?
SHE EXPLAINS HER POSITION
OAKLAND. Jan. 22.â Mrs. Roland P.
Gleason, president of Ebell and a dele
gate to the convention of Woman's Clubs
in Los Angeles, has returned from the
south enthusiastic over the great meet
ing r.nd the reception accorded the ladies
from this part of the State. Mrs. Gleason
also returns converted from the indiffer
ence she formerly felt in federation to the
btlief that under the constitution adopted
by the convention no club that is eligible
to jcir. should stay out.
Mrs. Gleason, to the surprise of many
who knew of her former mild opposition
to federation, has become an officer of the
federation just formed, and when inter
viewed said that she was pleased to have
the opportunity of explaining how her
election took place and its terms, realiz
ing that having been sent from an organ
ization that for the most part is inimical
to federation she realized that she had
been put in an awkward position by being
put on the general ticket.
"In the lirst place," said Mrs. Gleason,
"we were delighted with the very courte
ous and womanly way in which delegates
from the north were received. Anci the
lodies of Los Angeles were in turn de
lighted to have the Ebell send delegates
along with the other clubs, for the Ebeli
of Los Angeles wad organized with the
assistance of ladies who formerly be
longed to Oakland's Ebell. At the opening
of the convention we were pleased at tlii
attitude taken toward representatives like
ourselves from clubs not decided as to
whether they would join or not. It was
decided that such delegates should be
Raked to report back to their "-esp::ctive
clubt, that thirty days would be given for
i.nal cec.'sion as to joining and that at the
expiration of the thirty days all cluds
Joining should be considered chart.r un-m
berr.
"Mrs. Ginn and I did not occupy a
unique position there. We found repre
sentatives from thirteen other clubs, who
had been also asked to go to Los An
geles, to abstain from voting In the name
of their clubs' federation and to rrep o t
back on the question. Representatives
from twenty-live clubs came prepared to
pledge their organizations to a State
union of clubs. We who voted reservedly,
it was understood, would leave the mat
ter of decision with the bodies sending us.
"In the making of the ticket the nom
inating committee was anxious that the
Oakland Kbell be represented, if only
temporarily. With that understanding
my name was proposed for a vice presi
dency, and this action must receive the
approval of the Ebell here before it can
be final. I was extremely loth to accr.pt
the honor, since it placed me in the posi
tion of being a delegate from a club un
willing to federate and an officer, if pro
tern., of the federation. However, Mrs.
Ginn agreed that the fine womanly cour
tesy that had characterized our reception
required a graceful acceptance of the
temporary and much-urged office. The
Kbell Society, you understand, was to bÂ«>
committed in no way by my being a vice
president.
"We were especially delighted with the
conciliatory and conservative constitution
adopted. Its pfecond article, which gives
the object of federation, reads:
Its object shall be to unite the influence and
enterprise of California women to promote
measures which all can lndorsp. whether these
be educational, moral or social, and to com
pare methods of study and work. The conintl
tutlon of clubs applying for membership must
show that they have no sectarian or political
bias and that while distinctly humanitarian
movements may be recogniied the chief purpose
is not philanthropic or technical, but social,
literary, artistic or scientific culture.
"A number of organizations are not eli
gible. These are the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, College Alumnae as
sociations. Young Woman's Christian
Association, civic leagues, suffrage clubs
and college settlements. These send
out " propaganda and are therefore
barred. The by-laws provide that no
club In the federation devoted to one
specific purpose can bring its subject
before the biennial convention except
by the unanimous consent of the board.
The board will work along educational
lines altogether, but differe-nt districts
may take up local work. Forestry, the
saving of the old missions and traveling
libraries in mining regions are some of
the subjects to be handled.
"I do not see how any club eligible to
federate can hesitate to do so in view
of the constitution, for the work planned
is on broad lines that have no elements
liable to cause any division of the mem
bers. Mrs. Burdette will herself visit
Oakland soon, perhaps before Mrs. Ginn,
and I make our reports, and will explain
more fully the object of fedration to the
ladles of Oakland."
Mrs. Ginn, who though a member of
the Century Club of San Francisco, did
not represent any club but the Kbell, has
gone to Coronado for a few days, accom
panied by Mrs. John ISakewell.

SHOT BY HER BROTHER.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN JOSE, Jan. 22.â The mystery sur T
rounding the injury to little Lou Cornu
in the foothills near West Side has been
cleared up. The shooting was at first
laid to a tramp who had been refused
something to eat, and Sheriff Langford
arrested no less than a dozen suspects.
Saturday evening Sheriff Langford ar
rested John Cornu. father of the girl. To
day he broke down and confessed his 14
year-old son, Louis Cornu, had shot his
sister accidentally. Being afraid the boy
would be prosecuted they concocted the
tramp story. His wife was not home at
the time. He said the boy shot the girl
on Saturday night, but he knew nothing
about It till the following Monday night.
The boy had put the little girl to t>ed and
claimed she was sick. It was not until
the wound took a serious turn nearly a
week after that they reported to the au
thorities. The wound is now nearly
healed.

WHEELER FORBIDS THE
FACULTY TO MEDDLE
SCHOOL POSITIONS NOT FOR
FAVOBITES.
Students Must Not Obtain University
Influence in Seeking Appoint
ment as Teachers.
BERKELEY, Jan. 22.â President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler has Just issued a cir
cular to faculty members of the uni
versity calculated to do away with the
charges of undue Influence used by-pro
fessors in procuring positions for favored
graduates and to relieve the Instructors
of the annoyance to which applicants
for such positions have subjected them.
The circular is as follows:
To the Officers of Instruction of the Univer
sity: As it seems desirable that the university
should adoct and follow a definite policy in
all of it- relations to the schools the members
of the faculty are requested to observe the
following rules In connection with the recom
mendation of teachers:
1. Advice Is not to be offered to school au
thorities unasked, or at the request of appli
cants for positions.
2. Members of the faculty are at liberty to
answer requests from school officers for an In
dividual opinion about tartioular persons, or
about matters of school administration; but
Â¦where a nomination Is asked for tha matter
muat be resorted to the president's office. In
crdpr that all possible candidates may be con
sidered and the best person available for the
position be selected.
3. No written recommendations, to be used
at their own discretion, are to be given to
candidates for either appointment or promo
tion. Reports on the work of students must
be Hied with the appointment secretary, who
will mall copies to school officers at their re
quest or at the request of the students con
cerned. No special recommendations are to be
sent to school officers. exceDt in answer to a
request for such information from the authori
ties.
4. Members of the faculty will please refrain
frcm mentioning to students probable vacancies
In school positions, especially where such In
formation Is gained by examiners while offi
cially engaged in the inspection of schools ap
plying for accrediting.
Very respectfully,
BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER.
President of the University.
The evil at which the orders are aimed
Is one of long standing, both at the uni
versity and throughout the State. Dis
appointed-candidates who were not uni
versity graduates have complained that
the university was cornering the teach
ers' positions as fa3t as they became
vacant, and on the other hand the pro
fessors are continually besieged by im
portunate students whose demands for
recommendations It is impossible to es
cape. The order is. therefore, for vari
ous reasons a welcome one to the faculty
members.

RULED OFF
TWO MEN FOR
MISCONDUCT
California Coursing Committee
Took Action â Notes of
the Meeting.
At a meetir.g of the California coursing
committee held last night J. Douglas and
J. H. Ryan of Sacramer.io were ruled off
the sword for conduct unbecoming gen
tlemen and coursing men. The action of
the committee was as swift as it was se
vera. Both men were members of tho
Capital City Coursing Club and were sum
marily dealt with by that orgasization for
their offenses and the matter was referred
to the board for action. The punishment
is extremely severe, as the erring ones
will be unable to participate in the sport
in any park under the jurisdiction of the
committee.
Among the other business transacted by
the board was the following: Sam's Folly,
by Hover-Queen, was accepted for regis
tration. 6am Mount is the owner of the
bitch. Daniel Delury was elected a mem
ber of the board as a representative of
the Ingleside Coursing Park. Any get of
Nig. by Phil Shcndan-Nora, will be re
ceived 'for registration. William O'Neil
and Dr. Weidon wtre elected as repre
sentatives of the Sacramento Coursing
Club. Secretary Malcom was notified by
the committee to notify the lng'.esida
Coursing Club and other clubs not to ac
cept the entry of American Eagle.
In tho discussion over the latter decision
it developed that American Kagle was
ruled off by the Interstate Coursing Club
two years ago and afterward reinstated
by the Ingleside Coursing Club. The mem
bers of the committee concluded that It
was not just to allow the dog to run at
one park to the exclusion of the other, and
therefore notified its secretary to inform
the clubs to refuse its entry. A litter by
American Eagle-Airship, however, will
be accepted for registration. Charles
Ueisler. owner of Lily of the Valley, will
be notified by the secretary to change the
name of his bitch to avoid future tangle.
The next meeting of the board will be held
on February 5. The following coursing
men compose the committee:
Interstate Coursing Clubâ J. F. Halton,
J. R. Dickson. P. Moran, J. A- Kline, R.
K. MaJcom; Ingleside Coursing Clubâ D.
Dillon, H. A. Deckelman, Dan Delury,
Captain Claxkson and W, E. Thompson;
unattached members â Judge John Grace,
Judge P. J. Reilly, Dr. Q. V. Hummel of

FLING AT THE
GOVERNOR'S ACT
County Clerk Jordan's
Notice.
ALL OVER REGISTRATION
IMPORTANT.
Notice to
VOTERS
REGISTRATION.
Office of the County Clerk, Alameda
County, Cal.
Notice is hereby given that in accord
ance with the provisions of chapter 53,
Statutes of 1899, a^ voters of Alameda
County must apply for reregistration in
order to be able to vote at the general
election in November.
Owing to the failure of the Gov
ernor to approve the Act providing
assistance for Clerk passed in both
branches of the last Legislature with
but one dissenting vote, it is impor
tant that voters should apply for regis
tration at once in order to expedite the
work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Jan. 22.
This la a portion of the Alameda County
notice fox reregistration that the Alameda
County Board of Supervisors rescinded to
day as reflecting upon Governor Gage.
Under the new registration law it is
necessary for every voter to reregister,
and County Clerk Frank C. Jordan has
been struggling for several weeks to se
cure additional help from the Board of
Supervisors to do this work. His strug
gles for this help went back to the last
session of the Legislature, when a bill al
lowing him this help was passed, but was
vetoed by Governor Gage, throwing the
l/urden of this work upon his shoulders.
On top of this the Alameda County Super
visors refused to allow him any additional
assistance for the work, ana Jordan is
now behind the proposed extra session
in the hope of securing assistance from
the Legislature.
One week ago the Supervisors author
ized County Clerk Jordan to issue a no
tice to voters, the preparation of the no
tice being left to him. The notice was
prepared and printed for the Ilrst time
on Friday evening.
In that notice the County Clerk told
some of the story of his failure to secure
help through the Governor's veto, and the
Supervisors objected to this to-day as a
reflection upon the Governor from an of
ficial source.
Supervisor Church called the attention
of the beard to what was considered a
reflection upon the Governor In an official
document. Several of the Supervisors ex
pressed the opinion that while the reflec
tion was probably not intentional that' it
did not look well in a statement issued
under authority of their board. The au
thority to issue and publish the call for
reregistration was then rescinded, and the
matter will come up at another meeting
of the board when County Clerk Jordan
can be present in person.
County Clerk Jordan was called last
night out of the city and the board could
secure no statement from him.

LARGE FAMILY
ALLOWANCE IS
IN JEOPARDY
Executrix Steeie Is
Again Cited.
HENRY MORSE'S BIG CLAIM
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan 22.
Emma S. McPherson Steeie, widow of
the late E. L. G. t-teele. has been cited to
appear before Superior Judge Greene next
Monday to show cause why her $1<XÂ«)
monthly family allowance should not be
discontinued.
The citation was issued to-day on pe
tition of Henry N. Morse, who ask 3
that Mrs. Steeie also show cause why
she should not pay into court out of mon
eys in her hands as executrix of the es
tate of her husband the sum of $20,2^0.
there to be paid over to Morse in the
event that he should establish his claim
now In litigation in a suit against the
executrix, pending on appeal in the Su
preme Court.
E. L. G. Steeie died In 1594. and his es
tate was appraised at J156.(0. Within the
statutory time Morse presented a claim
for $'J f ),2<i<) against the estate, which claim
was based on a contract between Steels
and Morso, dited September 20, 1592.
whereby the former 'undertook to care
for a hundred Jacks, jennies, mares, etc..
belonging to Morse anil placed on Steele's
Ranciio "Felicfdad." near Salmon Falls,
for breeding purposes; and at the end of
four years the colts were to be sold for
the mutual benefit of both parties and
the proceeds were to be equally divided,
Morse alleges that Steeie during his life
time neglected to properly care for the
animals; that now the ranch is in charge
of Frank V. Terry, and there are but
twenty-seven of the animals and their In
crease remaining from the original herd.
When Morse presented his claim to the
widow executrix she ignored the same,
and the former, deeming this a rejection,
brought suit, which terminated last
March In Judgment for the widow. Morse,
however, appealed the case to the Su
preme Court, where It Is still pending, lie
sets up that numerous claims were filed
against the estate, and because of the de
preciation In values of property and the
accumulation of the family allowance the
estate will be unable to pay its indebt
edness together with costs of administra-.
tion dollar for dollar: but that recently
the executrix received $37,500 in settlement
of a claim against Florence Blvthe
Ilinckley for moneys advanced by E. L.
G. Steeie to enable the latter to prose
cute her contest over the late Thomas
Blythft's millions. Now Morse asks that
Mrs. Steeie pay into court the amount he
hopes to recover through a possible re
versal of the decision of the Superior
Court.

Olympia.
There Is a pood bill at the Olympia this
week. Will H. Hill's performance on the
hl^h wire was well received last night,
and the pictures thrown on the form of a
young woman who calls herself Mile.
Ihelma were thoroughly appreciated. The
other attractions are acceptable.
Chutes.
The moving pictures of the Jeffrles-
Eharkey fight at Coney Island are prov
ing a groat card at the Chutes Theater.
Last night the numerous exciting round 3
were wildly applauded by a large audi
ence. Robert Smilax and company and
their comedy bulldogs give a novel act
in which a brindle pug plays the star
role. Major Mite appears this week in
a Hebrew impersonation, singing "Oh,
Such a Business." and makes a quick
change to an Irishman. Matt Keefe. a
sweet-voiced tenor, received three en
cores, and the three D'Estelle sisters gave
pome pretty fancy and grotesque dances.
The Leandor brothers, gladiatorial acro
bats, and the Columbian Four, musical
artists, completed an interesting pro
gramme.
Trebelli's First Concert.
The first of the Trebelll concerts was
piven last nipht at Sherman & Clay Hall,
which w.is comfortably filled, for the most
part with well-known musical people.
There wap promise in the programme of
a delightful evening of song, and the re
peated bursts of applause were hardly
necessary to testify that the prima donna
was soul-satisfying. It is three years now
since Mile. Trebellis voice has been heard
in this city, ami last night at the conclu
sion of the concert the verdict was freely
expressed on all sides that it was absolute
perfection.
The lengthy programme was introduced
with Dvorak's very difficult "O. Virgin
Mother" ("Specter Bride"), in which the
singer showed the great sustaining power
of her voice. In the balatella from "I
Pagliaeci" and in Mascagni's "Pera
d'Amore" and '"La Tua Stella" the purest
method wits shown. Undoubtedly, how
fVfr, the most pleasing number on the
programme was the "Carnival of Venice,"
replete with opportunity to display the
wonderful riches of the "singer's voice. At
the close sh*> was encored repeatedly.
The possibilities revealed in the first
part of the programme were more than
achieved in the second. Great power of
expr*Â»ssion was shown in the familiar
songs. "Away, Away!" "Cherry Ripe"
and Haydn's "My Mother Bids Me
Bind My Hair." In Bemburg's
musical setting of Theodore de Ban
dille's "l'Amour de ma Mie" and
Chaminade's "Si J'etais Jardinier" Mile.
Trebelll was as clear and as sparkling as
champagne. She closed with Tosti's
"Spring" and was so loudly applauded
that she responded with the famous
"Laughing Song."
Robert Clarence Newell, the accompan
ist, showed remarkable technique in
Schutt soli in the Interlude.
Mile. Trebelll will give two more con
certs this week at Sherman & Clay Hall,
one Thursday evening and the other Sat
urday afternoon.

NEW YOEK, Jan. 22.â Dr. John T. Thelberg, a wealthy blind
physician, who lives at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, was ar
rested to-day for whipping a 14-year-old boy named Arthur Mag
net. The boy declares that the physician beat him on the head with
a gold-headed cane with such force that the cane was broken. The
doctor says that as the boy's guardian he has the right to punish
him. Young Magnet asserts that he doesn't know where he was
born, but that he used to live with a Mrs. Frazee at 8 Hopeton ter
race, off Washington street, in San Francisco, and that when he
was four years old Dr. Thelberg came and took him away. At
the time he was taken away Mrs. Froze*, the boy says, informed
him that Dr. Thelberg was his father. As a reason for the beating
the boy declares that for some time the physician has been trying
to force him to go to sea, and that when he flatly refused to go the
cane was broken on his head. The magistrate has postponed exami
nation of the case until to-morrow.

Mr. Spreckels called attention to the
success which has greeted the bonds
which have been issued for the construc
tion of new ships. These ships, he report
ed, will increase the number of round
trips during the year from eight or nine
to seventeen. The ships in speed, equip
ment and comfort will be without peers
in the Pacific Ocean and will, contribute
materially to the upbuilding of the com
merce of the coast. There is, the presi
dent reported, every reason to expect sub
stantial mail subsidies from the Govern
ment of New Zealand. As a whole tho
aftairs of the company could not be In a
better condition and the future could not
promise a brighter outlook.
The total net earnings for 1899 were
$374,747 45. an increase of J49.190 05 over
those of 189 S. In the net earnings of ISU9
the steamship Zealandia contributed J90,
569 35 for her services asia Government
transport. Deducting this amount from
the total of net earnings leaves as net
earnings in the regular trade J279,1iS 40,
which is an increase of $101,401 64, or about
63 per cent, over the regular trade earn
ings of IS9S. There Is now in the treasury
the sum of $296,547 60, as against $222,901 32
in IS9SÂ», making an increase of $73,646 28.
This sum does not include the money
which has been received from the sale of
bonds. These bonds are now very highly
considered by investors, as the premium
upon them demonstrates. The entire au
thorized amount of $2,5U0,000 has been sub
scribed for at par. Bonds to the extent
of $1,250,000 have been issued and partial
payments to the amount of $725,534 have
been made on account of steamship con
struction and further payments will soon
become due.
One of the most important parts of the
president's report deals with the construc
tion of these new ships and the enormous
increase of the service which will be oi
vital interest to the commerce of the
coast. The president reports that the re
quirements of the trade are beyond the
present capacity of the company, but it is
fortunate that the new ships, the con
struction of which was authorized at the
last annual meeting, will be sufficient to
meet the increasing demands of trade.
The first of these three ships will be
launched in a few days and will be able
to take up the running on June 13. It will
be followed two months later by the sec
ond vessel and four months later by the
third. As already Indicated, they will be
without peer on the Pacific Ocean and
could not be duplicated now at an In
creased cost of 25 per cent. When they
are put In commission the Alameda and
Mariposa will be withdrawn in turn to
receive new boilers, machinery and other
improvements, which will Increase their
speed and capacity.
The president reported also that he had
visited Washington in connection w:th
securing mail subsidies, and confidently
expects increased revenue from this
source when the new steamships are
ready for service. Proposals have been
made also to the Government of New Zea
land with a view to the establishment of
Dr. Parker's Cough Cure. One dose will stop

Commercial Museum Delegates.
In accordance with the request of Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the Uni
versity of California, the Merchants* As
sociation has appointed the following: com
mittee of five to attend the conference
to be held this. evening at the Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art upon the proposed
establishment of a commercial museum in
San Francisco: Isaac Upham, S. Suss
man. James Hogg, Everett N. Bee and
Adolph Mack. The Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association has appointed as
delegates to the same meeting as follows:

a complete new service. These proposals
.specify that the New Zealand Govern
ment shall pay annually to the Oceanic
Steamship Company the sum of Â£30,000 in
consideration for seventeen trips a year
with the new steamships, instead of thir
teen trips now given with two Amerlc.in
ships and one British vessel. *;:'i
The offer to the Oceanic Company is to
perform the new service exclusively with
American ships, as it must do if it avails
itself of the terms of the United States
law governing postal contracts. Under
the proposed conditions the ships would
sail every three weeks instead of four,
with the time of the voyage greatly re
duced. No definite arrangement has yef
been reached with the colonies, but the
president of the company believes that
when, the colonial Parliament meets in
June a satisfactory agreement will be
made. â¢ . :.; â¢
With these plans the president . looks
forward confidently to an extremely
bright future. The company, instead of
furnishing eight or nine trips a year, will
give seventeen, and make the time In
transit between Australia and London as
good as the best the Suez canal route can
offer. It will at the same time handle the
New Zealand malls in four days' less
time.
The report of the secretary, to ; which
the president referred, is important, and
Is in full as follows:

and were delighted when Panama was
reached.
The ship Cyrus "Wakefleld, now on her
way to Honolulu, is likely to have trou
ble with her crew in the islands. She has
over 4000 tons of general cargo aboard,
and there will be some hard work in dis
charging it. Then she is to load sugar for
New York, and ther^^lll be more labor
getting it aboard. '.Tliat being the case,
there is likely to be a few desertions be
fore the vessel is ready to sail for New
York.
The transport Pennsylvania will get
away with a full cargo of supplies for
General Otis. She will carry $1,500,000 in
specie for the payment of the soMiers.
An officer and ten men will go along to
guard the treasure. Besides these men
the Pennsylvania will take down four doc
tors, four officers and two Government
employes.

Arthur Frazee, Central Figure of a Strange Tale.
From a photo taken at the age of 11 years.
THE brief telegraphic message wh!ch
heads this article has dragged the
family Ekeleton from the closet of
a man who formerly moved in the
swellest social circles of San Fran
cisco, and has caused immeasura
ble mental torture to the woman out of
whose life the boy she loved was torn
seven long years ago.
When Mrs. V. Frazee. who lives at R
Hopeton terrace, which extends south
from Washington street, between Powoll
and Stockton, was informed that Dr.
Thelberg had been arrested in New York
for maltreatir.gthelad who formerly mnde
his home with her, she came near faint
ing and had to be carried to an open
window. Her anguish was something
pitiable, and as soon as she had re-cov
ered sufficiently to be able to speak co
herently the old lady told a tale which
â¢will interest residents of both this city
and New York. It is the tale of a wronced
â¢woman, of a man's effort to hide his child
away from the eyes of the world, of an
other woman's love for the little one that
had been brought into her life to supply
the place of others that had passed away,
of the marriage of the father in a far
away cJty, of the latent affection for his
offspring which finally developed to the
point where he tore it rudely from the
protecting arms which held it, and then
of physical misfortune and brutality,
which ended in the Police Courtâ a
etrange, cad tale. Into which at various
places creeps the dramatic clement.
Dr. John Thelberg was formerly a phy-
Eiclan well known fn this city, who for
months lived at the Palace and then at
the Baldwin Hotel. Here he moved in the
higtiest circles of society and attracted
considerable attention from the fair sex
on account of his handsome face and
agreeable personality. While living here
he did not practice his chosen profession
on account of holding a lucrative position
as chemist for the American Sugar Re
finery. Ten months after the birth of tha
child whose parentage was unknown until
stven years ago he was blinded by the
explosion of some chemicals while experi
menting Jn a drugstore on Clay street,
and shortly afterward went to the Belle
vue Hospital in New York to see if any
thing could be done to restore his sight.
The skill of medical scientists availed him
not and to-day he is as blind as when the
accident occurred.
"Dr. Thelberg came to live with my hus
band and me in 1S80," said Mrs. Frazee,
"and stayed here only a few months,
when mv husband, r.ho had taken a vio
lent dislike to him for some reason or
other, asked me to inform him that we
desired to live alone. Then he went away
and I <sid not sco him again until two or
throe days after my husband's death,
which occurred on July 16, ISSL
"At that time he returned and en
deavored to console me for my loss, and
now and then he would visit me. He was
always \*ery pleasant, and until I learned
of Ills wickedness I thought him a good
man. indeed. A year later he called to
see me again and told me that the wife
of a dear friend of his had died shortly
after giving birth to a child and that he
Intended to adopt It. He wanted me to
take the child and give it the best of
care, saying he would pay me well for
my trouble. I was astonished to hear
this, as he was only 2S years old then,
and said people would think it strange
for him to adopt a baby. I asked Its sex
and age. and he became confused and
said he had forgotten to Inquire. He finally
won my consent to take care of the child,
for I thought it would take the place of
ray own dear ones who had passed away.
"In the latter part of July he came
and told me to prepare for a short jour
oe y r did so and went aboard a vessel
on a Monday and did not get home until
the following Saturday. The place I was
taken to was Santa Barbara. \o a hotel
there on West street. The next day Dr.
Thelberg came for me in a carriage and
took me to a cottage on West street, a
short distance from the hotel. I was
ushered into the parlor, and in a short
time he returned with a bundle which he
placed in my arms. It was the baby.
"I brought it home and learned to love
it as a mother would her own child.
When the boy was 9 years old I took
him to old St. Mary's Church, on Du
pont and California streets, and had him
uaptized by Father Sullivan and chris
tened Arthur Frazee. His father had told
me his surname was Magnet, but 1 chose
that he should btar my name. He was
Etnt to the Le Conte School, on Powell
street, between V.'ashinpton and Jackson,
until the day he was torn from my arms,
and grew Into a fine, large boy.
"Aoout ten months after the child was
born his father met with an accident
which caused his blindness. The boy was
born on June 28, I&>2, and the reason why
his father was confused when I asked
him the sex of the child he wanted me
to take care of was that it had not yet
been born. Dr. Thelberg was asked to
investigate a chemical in a Clay street
drug store as he was passing in his buggy
and the chemical exploded and made him
blind.
"He stayed at the Baldwin Hotel for six
months and then went to Bellevue Hos
pital, Xew York, where he had graduated
as a physician, to see if anything could be
done for him. It could not, and I after
ward learned from an old English gentle
man named Webb, who used to live at
South Park, but is now dead, that Dr.
Thelberg had married a woman who had
graduated in the same year he did. Five
years after he had departed he pent a
lawyer here for the boy, and I refused to
give him up.
"It was In August. 1593, that he returned
here himself and asked for the boy. I
said nobody could have him, that I loved
him and he wanted to stay with me. Then
the doctor went before the courts and
swore that Arthur was his own child, and
I had to yield him up. The boy was 11
years old when taken away, and the night
before he went he cried dreadfully and
paid: 'Mamma, that man is going to take
me away. I want to die. I don't want to
go with him. Who Is he?" I said the
doctor declared he was Arthur's father,
and then the child became strangely still.
I wonder what he thinks now, when he Is
nearly 18 years old?
"The boy was taken to the Mount
Pleasant Primary School at Amherst,
Mass. All my letters to him were inter
cepted by Principal Nash in accordance
with orders I learned had been given by
Mrs. Thelberg. The physician showed me
Mrs. Thelberg's picture when he came
after Arthur and she looked like a kind
woman.
"Mr. Webb told me he had learned that
the mother of the boy was not dead at all
and that she had followed the father to
New York and had been permitted to visit
him while he was at the hospital and
bring him delicacies and flowers. She did
not live in Santa Barbara, but in San
Francisco, and went there a few months
before the boy was born.
"I love the boy and want him back
and believe he would like to return to
me. Where his mother is I don't know.
I should think from his still going by the
name of Magnet that Mrs. Thelberg does
not know that her husband is the boy's
father, but this brutality may end the
sorrow in his young life."
As an evidence of the love Mrs. Frazee,
who is a very old lady, bears for "her
Arthur." it may be mentioned that she
has made him the sole legatee to her
property by the terms of her will, includ
ing money In bank and valuable Jewels
in the safe deposit, besides considerable
real efttate.
The dispatch would seem to bear out her
impression that Mrs. Thelberg is unaware
that the boy is her husband's, as in it is
mentioned the fact that he claimed the
right to punish him on account of befn?
his guardian. The substance of the dis
patch is at variance with the facts in two
particulars. The boy, according to Mrs.
Frazee. Is now nearly IS years of age and
was eleven years old when taken away
by the father. - Â«
Threatened to Kill.

PLANS FOR THE
RECEPTION OF
LAWTON'S BODY
So Far They Are Very
Indefinite.
INCREASING INTEREST SHOWN
"Within a week the transport Thomas,
bearing the body of General Lawton, will
arrive. Interest In the probable action
of the army authorities is being shown
in various ways, but even the army
authorities are not sure as to what will
be done. The only definite arrangement
so far made is .that the body will be es
corted across the continent by General
Shatter and his aid. Colonel Wilson. It
may be that a guard of honor will be de
tailed from the garrison at the Presidio
to take charge of the body on the train,
but that has not been settled finally.
The reception given the body of the gen
eral will depend upon the wishes of Mrs.
Lawton. who is coming home on the
Thomas, and on the wishes of those in
charge of the funeral arrangements to be
held in Washington. The army people
here are ready to parade or supply guards
at any time, but it will take come day*
to arrange for any celebration in which
the city will take any active part.
Mayor Phelan has asked to be allowed
to participate in any public demonstration
as representing the city, and the Odd Fel
lows, of which order Lawton was a mem
ber, have Informed the headquarters that
if there should be a p?rade 1000 Odd Fel
lows will follow their dead comrade. Rtv.
Dr. Foute, rector of Grace Episcopal
Church, has also communicated with
headquarters with an offer of his church
as a place in which the body of the gen
eral may lie while awaiting shipment
East.
It cannot be known, however, whether
or not the body will be delayed here until
Mrs. Lawton has been seen. She rray
consent to remain over in San Francisco
for a day or two, or it may be that those
in charge in Washington will make such
a request in order to perfect their plans.
In that caso there will probably be a civil
and military demonstration. In case this
is not desired the body will be taken from
the transport at the Folsom-street wharf
and will be immediately removed to the
train under suitable guard.
It 19 not now Intended that there shall
be any saluting as the transport enter?
the harbor. At the time of the funeral
in Manila minute guns, in accordance
with the rank of General Lawton, were
fired from all posts, and it is probable,
that a similar salute will be given on the
date of the ceremonies in Washington. In
consequence there will not be any salute
fired except under orders from Washing
ton.
The body of Major John A. Logan will
also arrive on 'the Thomas. Major TucK
er. Major Logan's brother-in-law, Is now
here to receive and to escort the body
East. It will probably be put under the
guard of honor for General Lawton. and
will be accorded almost similar honors on
the way over.
With the change of commanders at the
Presidio has come a change in the office
of adjutant. First Lieutenant Le Roy
Eltinge giving place to Lieutenant J. B.
Parker of the same regiment, the Sixth
Cavalry. Major Cowles, who has Just re
signed command, has been made execu
tive officer of the post, a place that seems
to have been borrowed from the naval
system. On board a warship the execu
tive officer Is the working captain, exer
cising all his authority as the representa
tive of the captain, and with nearly as
much power. The office is a new one to
the Presidio.
Major William H. Comegya, paymaster
has been ordered to proceed by the trans
port Pennsylvania to Manila. He will be :
accompanied by his clerk and will hrve
in his charge several millions of dollars
to be used in the payment of troops no>v
in the field. First Lieutenant Thaddeus
B. Selgle. Thirty-eighth Infantry, with
three non-commissioned officers and six
privates selected from the recruits md
casuals, will go as a guard over the treas
ure.
Major Alfred G. Markley, Twenty-fourth
Infantry, has been ordered to proceed to
Manila on the Pennsylvania.
Acting Assistant Surgeon John H. Ma
cready has been assigned to duty at the
general hospital at the Presidio.
Major William Ennls. Sixth Artillery,
has been ordered to proceed to Honolulu
to take command of Camp McKinley. no*
in charge of Major Mills, also of the Sixth
Artillery. Major Mills upon being relieved
will proceed as soon as possible to Minlic.
where he will join his regiment. Major
Ennls will go down to Honolulu on the
next mall steamer, as transports are still
giving the island capital a wide berth.
HOFF MURDER CASE.
The Appeal Was Beargned Before tiia
Supreme Court.
The appeal case of Albert Frederick
George Verensenekockockhoff. commenty
called Albert Hoff. convicted of tha
murder of Mrs. Mary Clute in Judsa
Cook's court and sentenced to be hanged.
came up for reargument in the Supreme
Court yesterday. Last August the Su
preme Court reversed the judgment of
the lower court. Justice Temple, who
wrote the opinion, contended that the
Judge of the lower court had In instruct
ing the jury allowed himself to become
argumentative upon the fact 3 and the
circumstantial evidence introduced in the
trial. Justice McFarland and Justire
Garoutte dissented from the prevailing
opinion and the Attorney General asked
for a reargument.
Hoff was represented yesterday by
William H. Schooler and R. L. Simpson
and the prosecution by Attorney General
Tlrey L. Ford. Attorney Schooler's argu
ment was alone the lines of Justice
Temple's opinion. Mr. Ford showed that
over twenty States In the United States
have constitutions which are worded liko
that of California on the instructions to
juries, which had been upheld by the
highest courts and where the instruc
tions were similar to those in the Hoff
case. The same line of instructions, ha
contended, had been given here in the
cases of Durrant, Brandes and Botkln.
which had not been assailed, although
the parties had been convicted upon cir
cumstantial evidence. The court took
the matter under advisement.

HEAVY WEATHER
MADE HARD WORK
ON TRANSPORTS
Leelanaw in a Gale for
Two Weeks.
MANY SHIPS DUE FROM MANILA
GENERAL LAWTON'S BODY COM
ING ON THE THOMAS. W"
Mail Company's Steamer Barracouta
Damaged in a Hurricaneâ Moana
Will Not Sail Until
Thursday.
The transports arriving from Manila all
report*- exceedingly heavy weather dur
ing the latter part of the trip. The ship
Tacoma found it hard work to â¢ make
headway, and in consequence she was a
long time making the run. The Cone
maugh "caught it" on the great circle,
the captain reporting that the waves
ran mountains high, threatening at times
to engulf the ship. Captain Storrs of the
Leelanaw thought it would be very rough
on the great circle, bo he took the south
ern route. The Leelanaw arrived yester
day, and from all accounts she had a
worse trip than either the Conemaugh or
Tacoma.
The Leelanaw left Manila on December
20 and made the run to Nagasaki in a.
little over eight days. From Nagasaki
she went to ivobe, and after leaving the
latter port her troubles began. Captain
Storrs in his report says that from Janu
ary 1 to 16. nothing but a succession of
southeast and southwest gales: were en
countered. No sooner would one storm
blow itself out than another would come
up. The captain says he often saw the
crest of the "following" wave showing
clean over the topmast head of the Lee
lanaw. Captain Roberts of the Cone
maugh says he measured the waves and
that they were Co feet high, but Captain
Storrs is of the opinion that in the gales
he had to fight against the waves were
at least 100 feet high.
The Government has not yet decided
what to do with the Tacoma, Conemaugh
and Leclanaw. The chances are that the
.ship will be re-leased and that the two
steamers will go back to the Philippines
with a load of horses.
Quite a number of transports should
arrive here this week. The Manauense
is now out fourteen days from Yoko
hama; the Lennox, twenty-six days from
Manila: City of Peking, twenty-five days
from Manila; Senator, twelve days from
Nagasaki; Thomas, with General Law
ton's remains aboard, eleven days from
Nagasaki; Missouri and Benmohr,
twenty-two days from Manila, and the
Ohio ten days from Nagasaki. Several
others are from eight to fourteen days
out from Manila, and the Warren that
left here with the last of the colored
troops, is to sail to-day. All of these
vessels, with the exception of the
Thomas, Missouri and Warren, which
are owned by the Government, will be
returned to their owners as soon as they
reach port.
The British ship Clan Graham, ifter
trying for three days to make port, finally
arrived yesterday morning. Pilot Wallace
boarded the ship three days ago, and It
was a weary vigil for him. Half the time
the Graham was lost in the fog. and two
tugs that went out to look for her failed
to connect. Finally, when the fog lifted
yesterday morning, a tug picked her up
and brought her in. The bark Gatherer
also got in after being all night on the
bar. She made the run from Clallam liny
to ihe heads in a little over three days
steamboat time.
The mail steamer Moana will not get
sway for the colonies until Thursday
night. She was to have sailed Wednes
day, but the English mails are twenty
four" hours late.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Barracouta arrived at Panama yesterday
after a rery stormy passage from Cham
perico. She was caupnt in a similar stor'n
to the one in which the Colima went. down
and whs only raved by clever seaman
ship. The cargo shifted, the decks were
swept, bulwarks stove In, cabin flooded
and sails that were put on the vessel to
steady it were blown into ribbons. Cap
tain and crew had a very hard time of it
