interests of the city. While pos
ing as an officer of independent
action, free to choose whom he
pleased for public office and
guided only by his judgment of
what was best for San Francisco,
he waited until he received the
names of the men who are now
Police Commissioners. To the
general public, believing in his in
tegrity of purpose and freedom of
action, he was a high-minded,
public-spirited executive; to the
scheming blacklegs who had
bought the Police Department of
this city as the price of their in
fluence he was a fellow of their
own kind, ready to make a bar
gain and smear his hands in the
noisome pool of politics.
To the waiting public the
Mayor was saying that only the
best men would be chosen. ' To
the blackmailers who had pur
chased the Police Department as
an instrument for the better ma
nipulation of their plans he was
pleading for the, names he had
promised to announce as those of
his own choosing. He was
helpless in the coil of his
own making. He pleaded the
privilege of appointing R. H.
Lloyd as a member of the com
mission. His pleadings were met
with sneers. "We want Dr. Mc-
Nutt/' he was told, "and we will
have him. We know what he
will do and we do not know what
Lloyd may do."
And the Mayor's pleading
ceased. He had given the Police
Department and all its vast pow
ers to the men who had chosen
Frederick L. Esola, alias Fred
erick Harrington, for Chief of
bound to elect a man with an alias
to a post of the greatest trust and
responsibility.
With each day new evidence of
the desperate plot to turn the Po
lice Department over to criminal
influences is coming to light. It
has already been shown that
Esola selected J. J. Callundan,
alias Worthington, to be Chief of
Detectives. Callundan was not
even then in the Police Depart
ment: More than that, he was
ineligible to become a member.
But the plot had been formed to
convert the entire department
into a corrupt and corrupting
machine. It mattered little what
the record of Callundan was and
his ability was not a question for
discussion.
The first step was taken when
on January 4 he was smuggled
into the department as a patrol
man under the old commission,
which was then on the eve of
leaving office. The records of
Callundan's petition, examina
tion and election reveal a remark
able series of discrepancies which,
however, are not the most serious
elements of the fraud. Under a
law of the old commission no one
who was not between the ages of
2i- and 30 could be elected a
member of the department. This
rule was established by the old
commission and had the full ef
fect of law. When Callundan
filed his petition he declared that
he was born in July, 1865, mak
ing him over 34 years of age and
ineligible. But the charter pro
vides that any man between the
ages of 21 and 35 years of age is
eligible, so Callundan was still
within the limit. .
Police. And now Mayor Phelan
squirms at the consequences of
his corrupt , bargain, but squirm
as he may, he must give his
pound of flesh. It is not that he
feels new moral scruples at the
dishonesty of his compact, but
that he smarts under the sting of
publicity. He knew when he an
nounced the names of the Com
missioners that he was in the po
sition of a stuffed jury rendering
a verdict in which it took no part.
If Mayor Phelan had an
nounced in his campaign
speeches that he intended to
make Frederick L ; Esola Chief
of Police, does he believe that he
would have won the votes of rep
utable . men who value their
homes and prize the good name
of their city? Does he believe
that if he announced that his
Chief of Police would appoint J;
J. Callundan, alias Worthington,
Chief of Detectives that he would
have secured the votes and the
active support of the Hallidies
and the Brittans? Does he think
that the votes would have been
the same if decent men knew that
he was bartering away their
rights, driving bargains with
criminals and making capital out
of the institutions for which he
professed such ostentatious care ?
He did not dare to come into
the open then and his Police
Commissioners should not permit
him to make them his catspaws
now. On Saturday night Mayor
Phelan looked upon this grave
matter as an occasion for amuse
ment. A sober second thought
may convince him that it is an
affair without parallel perhaps in
serious import in the history,' of
1 HE Police Commissioners
I have now their plain duty
before them. They have
the power to saddle a criminal po
lice administration upon San
Francisco or they can justify the
hope of the city and endow it
with honest police officials, guid
ed by a clean, upright policy and
governed by healthy public influ
ences. The power is in the hands
of the Commissioners and they
should show that no campaign
pledge of an ambitious office
seeker can force them into the
mire of public disgrace. They are
something more than playthings
of a Mayor who does not know
the meaning of a pledge unless
he njads in it some personal prop
erty or gain.
Perhaps an injustice has inad
vertently been done to Mayor
Phelan. It has been said, and he
has denied the assertion, that he
pledged the Police Commission
ers before their appointment to
vote for F. L. Esola for Chief of
Police. Mayor Phelan did not
force this pledge from them, be
cause he had no power to do so.
He did not choose the Commis
sioners, because he did not dare
to do so. He had sold the Po
lice Department for certain
newspaper support and he was
compelled to accept the conse
quences of his corrupt bargain.
Knowing to what tremendous
evil pun)oscs the Police Depart
ment may be put, he silenced his
scruples in the cries of his ambi
tion and bartered away the best
that are behind him in encourage
ment and support. Charges have
been preferred against him and
an attempt has been made to re
fute them. What his past may
have been is not a matter of mo
ment to the people of this city.
What boyish pranks or what
more serious may have clung in
memory to his name form no
part of the issue. The Esola of
to-day is the figure-head of influ
ences that will mean disaster and
death to some of the best inter
ests of San Francisco. Esola is
the creature of a corrupt bargain
and will be the tool of a worse
policy in public affairs.
He represents* the elements
that are kept in check only by
unremitting vigilance. He is
schooled to the principles of men
who would throw the city open
to the raid of gamblers and their
rout of criminals of both sexes.
It might be no exaggeration, un
der a police administration such
as he would give, to see nickel
in-the-slot machines on every
post in City Hall Park.
It seems strange that at the be
ginning of a new era for San
Francisco, when the trumpets of
reform are blaring forth their
promises, when schemes of civic
improvement are shouted at ev
ery turn, that the most important
and practically the only candidate
for one of the vitally important
offices of the city government
must clear his skirts of the mire
of scandal before he may be
chosen for the high office he
seeks. It is a sad commentary
upon the pledges that were given
and the promises that were made
to find ostensibly honorable men
San Francisco. The interests of
ever}'' reputable class in the city
are at stake, but the Mayor is mis
taken when he thinks that he can
gamble them against the hazard
of his personal ambition. Since
he looks so lightly upon the issue
perhaps he is ready to dine Fred
erick Lawrence Esola, alias Har
rington, and Jules J. Callundan,
alias Worthington, at his home in
honor of the dignities with which
he intends to clothe them.
Perhaps the Police Commis
sioners are ready to do the same.
They cannot honestly or consist
ently decline a social equality
with men with whom they intend
to establish an honorable official
relation. They cannot refuse an
association of their own choos
ing. In common justice they can
not force upon their equals some
thing-which they, are not ready
to accept themselves.
An. effort , has been made to
prove Â¦â¢ that the. solemn protest
which has been voiced against
the plot of Mayor Phelan has its
origin in a newspaper contro
versy, and is inspired by some
personal objection to Esola.
Nothing could be further from
the truth. The only interest
which The Call has in exposing
the * crooked compact of the
Mayor is to prevent if possible
the accomplishment of a social
crime, the betrayal of the city and
its people into the clutches of its
criminal classes. , .
As for the personality of Fred
erick L. Esola, it is practically a
matter of no concern. . It is not
what he is or was that makes the
evil; it is what he represents the
gambling .and^.criminal classes
NEW SAN FRANCISCO BOWED BY THE SHAME OF SCANDAL
DESPERATE PLAN TO CONVERT THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT INTO A GIANT AGENCY OF CRIME
To carry the fraud still -fur
ther, the physician's report of ex
amination shows that Callundan
is 29 years of age. The report of
the clerk of the board shows that
he is 33 years of age. So one
may take his choice and then
turn to the register of voters of
the Third Precinct of the Forty
first District and find that in reg
istering in 1898 Jules J. Callun
dan swore that he was 35 years
of age. The conclusion is inevit
able that somewhere he has lied.
Do the Police Commissioners
need this new evidence to dem
onstrate to them that they should
not make this man a Chief of De
tectives? Do they need more to
open their eyes to the scandalous
plot that has been hatched to
make a thieves' den of the police
office?
Callundan is Esola's choice.
Callundan represents and typifies
to Esola his ideal of detective ad
ministration and both Callundan
and Esola represent what the
Mayor of San Francisco plotted
in secret and now forces upon
San Francisco with an insolent
command that it must be ac
cepted. The Mayor called upon
newspaper critics to come from
their towers, so that he might
talk to them. They are now talk
ing to him and telling him that
he cannot smear the mire of his
political compacts upon the insti
tutions of this city; that he can
not force the people of this city
to pay the price of his dishonora
ble bond to blacklegs and to reap
the dread harvest of evil, the seed
of which he sowed in the dark
places of a disreputable cam
paign.

war between the factions of the
American Turf Congress and are likely
to wield a big influence in the delibera
tions of the body which will assemble in
spocial session at Covlngton, Ky., Janu

ment of circuit racing property by . the
Applegate-Corrlgan-Schulte combination.
Their argument Is that it will Injure the
interests of the men who sell the horses
that make the runners. The claim is thai
the more competitive Is racing and the
higher the purses the better is the de
mand for good horses. On this proposi
tion breeders dislike the plan of arranging
fixed dates for each of the big running
tracks and thus removing competition.

CONTRADICTORY ADVICES
COME FROM COLOMBIA
KINGSTON. Jamaica, Jan. 14.â Advices
Just received from Colombia reiterate the
statement that the main body of the Co
lombian revolutionists, after occupying
Bucaramanga on January' 6 and securing
large quantities of stores, proceeded to
ward Kocorro, to which otht-r bodies were
converging, with a view of forming a
Junction and making a concerted attack
upon Bogota. In this attempt, according
to the tame advices, the Colombians ex
pected the assistance of a. considerable
body of Venezuelans, understood to be
advancing from the frontier by way of
Culta.
On the other hand, the Government dis
patches reaffirm the reports of a com
plete rout of the main body of the insur
gents in two heavy battles near Bucara
manga and Ctrrita. entirely frustrating
the Insurgents' plan.
As against these advices from yet an
other quarter declare that the Govern
ment Is completely disorganized afld that
the Government troops are retreating to
ward Bogota, avoiding conflicts. In this
connection it is pointeJout that the draft
ing of Antioquin troops into the capital
is a significant indication of the Govern
ment's condition. i -

MYSTERY OF THE
WRECK UNSOLVED
Gale Prevents Launch
ing of Boats.
ST. JOHNS. Iff. F., Jan. 14.-The gale
has not yet blown itself out and the sea
is sUll too rouKh to allow boats to gel
near the wreck in St. Marys Bay. As yet
there is nothing to show the name of
the vessel. Ten bodies have been located
among the rocks and others can be seen
floating about. Plans have b*>en made for
the recovery of theee as soon as the
weather permits, and It may then be pos
sible to get at the name of the steamer
from pk-cts of boats wedged in the clefts
of rocks.
The Roman Catholic prieet of this dis
trict was given by. a villager a photo
graph, which had been washed ashore,
apparently from the wreck. This repre
sents a seaman wearing a cap, upon
which are the letters "S. M. 8. Falke.
The priest was also told that the ship
had dipped oft the rocks into deep water,
and had disappeared except for the top of
one mast and that a guernsey with the
letter* â¢â¢S. M. 6." had also been picked
up near the wreck.
It appears that the ship's funnel waa
banded red white and black, with a white
diamond. This funnel could not ~>e that
of the Falke, as she, being a North Ger
man Lloyd liner, would have a yellow
funnel. It is also thought that the pho
tograph might be one ot a waman on the
Gtrman warship Falke, or one taken
Â¦while itÂ» owner was on the FaJke. The
funnels most resembling that of the
wreck are those of the American Petro
leum Company, and the vessel certainly
had a lot of petroleum on board, as the
ocean is covered with It. causing hun
dreds of birds to perish. The Warren
line of Boston U known &s the "White
Diamond line." although the funnels of
its vessels are black; the wreck may have
been a chartered steamer with a white
diamond painted over the regular signal
to chow her as a Warren liner.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â The Times to
morrow will cay: It is believed here that
the wrecked vessel is one of three steam
ers chartered by the Standard Oil Ccm
pany. very likely the Helgoland, which
left Philadelphia January o for Bergen,
Norway.
The Helgoland, Captain Rltter, Is a steel
vessel, IS! feet long, with a tonnage of
2297 tons. She carried a crew of about
ttf ty men.

DIED WHILE NURSING
HER INDIAN LOVER
Miss Ella Richards a Victim of
Smallpox on the Ponca.
Reservation.
special Dispatch to The Call
WICHITA, Jan. 14.â Ella Richards, a
white woman, died yesterday on the
Ponca Indian reservation of smallpox.
Hers is the first fatality reported from
the reservation, although many are
stricken. Miss Richards went to the
Ponca reservation several weeks ago to
nurse an Indian lover, lack Fllnthouse,
who was stricken with smallpox. Her
friends at MlHvane attempted to dissuade
her; from groins when the news reached
her that Fllnthouse was 111, but she de
fled her parents by escaping from home
at night and bravely, alone, went to the
reservation, a distance of 100 miles.
â¢ The officers around the -Indian's tepee
refused her admittance, but she waited
her chance and slipped by them. Loyal

STUDENTS OF THE NEVADA
STATE UNIVERSITY IN REVOLT
Usual Rule of Seniority for Advancement
Is Ignored and Classes Threaten
to Resign in a Body.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
RENO, Ntv.. Jan. 14.â The Nevada State
TTnivensity has "troubles of Its own" Just
jiow. On iaet Wednesday R. D. Jackson,
professor of the schoo! of mints, tendered
2;is resignation as a result of his dissatis
faction with the recent action of the prts-
Jderst and Board of Regents In refusing to
prant him ar.y more leaves of absence.
Â«nd later In appointing Professor Thur
tell acting president during Dr. ."tubbs*
iibaence, instead of a senior professor, as
has been th* invariable custom. *.: >:n
Jackson and lYofessor J. Warne Phillies
tire seniors to Thurtell. Yesterday ttie
senior clars in mines and mining resigned
In a body as a mark of protect against the
action taken In Jackson's case. Last night
the students held an Indignation meeting,
til which the tenor of the speeches be
cfcine almon Incendiary against PrÂ»>sidÂ»nt
Fuibbs and the Board of Regents. After
tl:e meeting the tÂ»oys formed in line and
Â¦with a bra^s band and banners started for
the business part of town. Professor
Jackson heard of their Intention, headed
them off and begged them to quietly dis
j>oree. After three cheers for the pro
fessor they complied.
To-day Dr. J. warae Phillip* made pub
lic a iettcr to the acting president, in
v.-hich he calls attention to the Tact that
r.o laculty meeting has been called nnd
That the faculty has received no oOclal
Information regarding the Jackson mat
ter, and concluded as follows:
'i r*>gTet that I am Impelled to ea.y that
3 car.not meet with my students to give
them instruction until the faculty receives
n ?tntem*>nt from the president or the
Board cf Regents vindicating their recent
tction taken In regard to Professor Jack-
son, and removing the cloud under whiih
be Is leaving us."
Dr. Phillips has been professor of
physics, and both he and Jackson are ex
tremely popular with. the people and the
students. It is stated to-night that If Dr.
Phillips Is relieved the seniors of his class
wl!l also resign In a body.
President Â§tubbÂ« is at Fort Worth,
Tex., and acting President Thurtell is In
San Francisco to-day, so little can be as
certained as to the next step In the
squabble.
It is Â«tated by a member of the Board
of Repents that Jackson has taken many
more vacations than he was entitled to.
thai he has sacrificed his duties at the
university to outside business Interests,
and that they appointed Thurtell as act
ing president because they considered him
the best man. without prejudice or favor
itism.
The people of this part of the State are
preatly excited over the events, and it is
feared the outcome will rreatly Impair
the usefulness of the Institution.
Acting President Thurtell. when seen
last night at the Grand Hotel, said that
he had just received a telegram from
Reno Informing him that Professor
Phillips had also resigned from the
faculty of the Nevada State University.
Professor Thurtell left Reno on Friday
night, and at that time knew of no dis
position on the part of the students to
break out in opposition to faculty laws.
He claims that the forced resignation
of Professor Jackson was due to the fact
that the latter was preoccupied with his
own affair* and could not devote suffi
cient and Just time to the work of the
student* i:nr!Â«Â»r him

DARING CRIME
OF A ROBBER
Despoils Two Places in
the Daytime.
KANSAS CITT. Mo., Jan. 14.â A lone
robber, masked and armed, cleaned out
two restaurants In the center of the city
at 6 o'clock this morning under the Â£lare
of an electric light. In Lewis' restaurant
at 1210 Walnut street he pointed a pistol
at Stanley Brushwood, the cashier, and
then tapped the register while he kept
his revolver In plain view of two custo
mers eating near by. The contents of the
register had been transferred to the safe
but a few minutes before and the robber
secured only a handful-of chance.' -
When he had satisfied himself that there
was nothing more In sight he gave the
waiter and the two customers a parting
word of warning and skipped across the
6treet to the restaurant of Robert Mc-
Clintock. Here the robber covered Cash
ier Joseph Drysdale and commanded two
waiters and three customers to hold up
their hands. They complied promptly ana
the. robber emptied the register In a
twinkling. He pocketed the entire con
tents, $146, and backing out of the door
encountered a grocery solicitor. He
poked his revolver Into the solicitor's face,
wit a the command not to make an alarm
and forced him Into the restaurant, where
all the others still stood with arms up
fetretched. At this the robber darted down
a near-by alley and disappeared. Hardly
more than five minutes was consumed at
both Jobs, and the robber had plenty of
time to get away before the scared vic
tims had recovered composure.

rations of critical importance are going
on. The mystery is further deepened by
a dispatch from Boer headquarters,
which, although Issued on Thursday last,
makes no mention of General Buller's
flanking movement in the direction of
Potgleters Drift. It Is impossible that
this movement could not have been known
to the Boers, because It must havo been
in progress for two or three days, and
General Buller himself states . that the
Boers were intrenched four and a half
miles north of his advanced posts.
The Boers also are probably "playing
'possum." There is a delightfully naive
affectation of perplexity In the conclud
ing statement of tho dispatch, that the
object of the British Is conjectured, but
Is by no means clear.
Tho statement that Ladysmith has been
firing rockets during the two. nights pre
ceding Buller's advance is also puzzling.
General French appears to have work
ed around the Boer flank. He is said to
have 4000 Boers surrounded. ,but unless ho
has been very much strengthened this
must be a risky game. ' . ,
FIGHTING RENEWED ON
LADYSMITH OUTPOSTS
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
NEW YORK. 'Jan. 15.â The Journal
prints the following, which it asserts Is"
the first news of a hitherto Unrecorded
fight:
LADYSMITH. Jan. 11.â No further Boer
movements to attack us havo been made
since Saturday, when they evidently had
enough. â¢ -
There was a slight brush' early, this
morning on the outposts. The attack on
tho hill was a close call and resulted In
a severe addition to the Caesar Camp
losses. Relief is evidently expected soon,
as the garrison rations have been In
creased.
FRENCH'S ATTEMPT TO
FLANK THE BOERS
Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â The Journal has
the following from Rensberg, dated Jan
uary 12: General French has succeeded In
temporarily getting behind the Boers,
cutting off the possibilities of retreat. A
small detachment of carbineers recon
noitered the enemy's flank and discovered
the enemy 800 strong In a. laager five
miles to the southeast of Stormberg. The
British scouts retired and are safe. Col
onel Porter followed In a reconnoissance
with a force of the Household Cavalry
and a New Zealand contingent with four
guns and succeeded In occupying Slingers
fontein, ilvo miles to the east or the
enemy's position, and five miles from
NorvaJs Pont. The Boers discovered the
movement and made a vigorous attack,
but the British guns forced them to re
tire.
Simultaneously another British battery
advanced to the plain to a point near the
railroad connecting Colesberg and Rens
berg. The Boer guns, however, proved an
overmatch for tho British, both In range
and accuracy, the latter being forced to
retire, having several horses killed.

LONDON. Jan. 13.â Although there I3
every reason to suppose that fight
ing is proceeding: upon the line of
the Tuge'.a River, no report has
been allowed to come through since
General Ruller's statement of his
arrival at Potgieters Drift.
In connection with this general move
ment General Sir Charles Warren, either
on Thursday or Friday, moved with about
11.000 men In the direction of Weenen,
which would give color to the view that
both flanks of the. Boer army are being
threatened as a preliminary to a deter
mined advance on Mount Inhlawe, to the
east.
Colenso. upon the southern bank of the
Tugela, must be cleared of the Boer force
which has been holding It, since other
wise this force might be able to threaten
the British line of communications.
It is quite possible that Warren will co
operate in the attack on this mountain.
Now that the Tugela is running at flood
the time Is favorable, as it will be difficult
for the Boers to reinforce their position
south of the river except by a pontoon
bridge, which is believed to have been
constructed. In the absence of any official
news the War Office Is remaining ob
durately silent.
London yesterday was full of rumors.
It was freely reported that engagements
had taken place at three different points
along the extended Boer lines. As a mat
ter of conjecture this may be correct, for
there is reason to . suppose ' that Borne
movement was made against Colenso sim
ultaneously with the seizure of Potgietcrs
Drift.
It is quite possible also that an attempt
to flank the Boers may be mado on both
the east and west, but the ground on fhe
east is more difficult than that toward
Springfield, and to make a wide detour in
the direction of Wecnen would necessarily
require a large amount of transport.
If fighting really occurred at three
points yesterday or Saturday they would
most likely be Mount Hlangwana, Colenso
and some spot north of Potgleters Drift,
marking a step In that process of envel
oping the Boers, to which General Buller
is obviously committed.
In this connection a dispatch to the
Daily Telegraph from Frcre, dated
Wednesday, the day before active opera
tions began, in which the correspondent
looks forward to some decisive event and
was making preparations to take up a
wagon load of luxuries for the troops at
Ladysmlth, clearly indicates that at Frcre
It was unOerstood that the British at
tempt to relieve Ladysmith was about to
be made.
A brief dispatch from Lord Roberts, the
first the new commander-In-chlef has
sent, which the War Office issued at mid
night, tends to puzzle the public still fur
ther. It was dated Sunday, and simply
says: "No change in the situation to
day," but does not state since when there
has been no change, and there is no in
formation as to what tho situation really
has been since Tuesday.
The whole position of affairs on tho Tu
gela is enveloped In mystery, which can
onjy be understood a3 Implying that ope-
-' Correspondence of the Associated Press.
LONDON. Jan. 6.â Letters from the
soldiers fighting against the Boers
are published in largo numbers,
and in many cases are just as Inter
esting as the accounts by trained
war correspondents. A medical of
ficer under Lord Methuen, describing the
battle of Modder River, writes:
A lot of Xorth Lancashire men were hor
ribly wounded. I turned over a sergeant, black
In the face, dead. One man was brought to me
who had been struck by a shell fragmentâ face
mutilated, throat cut and chest lacerated. Oh.
God! The night was slckenlnsâ blood every
where! Very lew of our men belns wounded.
1 went out near sunset to^id the Highland
ers. They had beÂ«n lying a\l day under the
frightful sun and their wounded were still
there. No stretcher bearers could advance, as
they were all shot at. They shouted to me to
crawl on the cround, as, though most of, the
firing was over, there were still three or four
Boers with express rlflea and explosive bul
lets, who were under cover and who kept pick
ing off our men. Some men utterly collapsed,
and all I could do was to put a. pad to their
wounds and my whisky flask to their Upa. I
then crawled back to my horse and made my
way to some ambulances two miles distant to
get their aid. I was under fire all the time,
bullets dancing around me. I felt a kind of
solemn disregard, as 1 had been exposed to dan
ger before.
In a letter written to his father from
Mooi River on November 23. an officer in
the Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment
says:
Against an enemy like the Boers Infantry iÂ»
useless. The Boers have spies everywhere, and
as they are well mounted they can move away
hours before our infantry can get within strik
ing distance. On the other hand, they will
never attack, and when we advance toward
Pretoria commandos will be left all over the
country-, looting and burning farms. The only
people who have a. chance with them are the
local volunteers. If the Government would only
raise about 2000 volunteers and send out a lot
of mounted Infantry who could work with the
local volunteers these Isolated Boer forces
would soon be wired out. At present we are
helpless. , as they make rings around us.
The special correspondent of the Czse
Argus thus describes a bombardment of
Kimberley:
What will probably be handed down In the
annals of history to Boer posterity as the
bombardment of Klmberely probably occurred
on Thursday. November 7. and It ever the
farcical element were introduced Into such a
serious business as war the puerile attempts
to raze Kimberley can surely claim It. The
Boers had two guns mounted, one on Scholz
Nek. trained on the Premier mine at Wesselton.
at a range of something like S5OO yards, and the
other at Spytfontein, quite 7000 yards distant.
A couple of shots were fired between 5 and 6
o'clock In the morning, but then the Boers de
sisted until 10 o'clock, when the gun at Scholz
Nek, apparently a nlne-pounder. firing a
French shell, opened fire on Wesselton. The
fire, however, proved quite harmless, nearly all
thÂ« shots falling in the debris heaps. Our guns
at Wesselton replying, and quickly getting the
range. Induced the enemy to cease firing acJ
they cleared off about noon.
So little was thought of the Boer fire that
tho alarm was not even sounded and business
was carried on Just the same. Thus ended
tho bombardment of Klmberely. So little
alarm did it cause that the men In tha redoubts
were actually playing cricket and quoits while
It was going on.
The following is from a letter from a
reservist sergeant in the Coldstream
Guards, who is with Methuen's column.
He was at the battle of Modder River and
says:
During the afternoon some one seemed to
have si>otted me from the trenches. First a
shot struck the side of my boot and then one
struck my rifle Just In front of my face,
filling my eyes with drit and xpllnters. I rose
up a little, when another bullet struck the
middle linger of my left hand. I had got en
my Knees when a bullet struck me fair in
the chest, on the buckle of my haversack,
breaking through, and causing a slight puncture
of the skin and bruising my chest. 1 hayÂ» been
congratulated as being the luckiest beggar la
my battalion.
From the Boer sides come reports Just
as interesting. A lad of 17 wrote to his
mother after the battle of Elands Laagte,
and the letter is published in the Journal
de Geneve, as follows:
We were on a kopje. Our horses were behind
It In a hollow. As the infantry advanced
against us we began shooting. When It looked
as If we were going to be eurrounded a certain
number of our men fell back to another posi
tion. About a hundred of us remained on the
kopje. But the fire of the Maxima and ether
puns became so violent that we withdrew a lit
tle to find cover. The general and Command
ant VHJoen rallied us and brought us back to
the top of the hill and advised us to get under
shelter there aa much aÂ» possible. I followed
the general with a dozen others to the right
and Vlljoen led the rest to the left. The Eng
lish were still advancing and they were now
within COO yards of us. It was easy to recog
nize the kilts they were wearing. We fired
at them Incessantly. All our bullets seemed to
strike. I had not time to be afraid. I ptayed
God and fired on. aiming each time at one
of thetr men. Tou know lam not a bad shot.
Their Maxima gave us back what we sent
them without a moment's etop. A few of us.
find our position to risky, ran back to
where the horses were and rode off. I waa close
to the general and remained.
ROBERTS REPORTS NO
CHANGE AT THE FRONT
LONDON, Jan. 15.â The War Office issued at mid
night a dispatch from Field Marshal Roberts, dated Cape
Town, January 14, 8:30 p. m., saying:
"There is no change in the situation to-day."
The War Office simultaneously published the follow
ing from Lord Roberts, dated Cape Town, January 13,
3:30 p. m:
"Methuen's cavalry reconnoissance returned on January
11. It went twenty-three miles into the Free State. The
country was clear of the enemy, except patrols. All is
quiet at Modder River.
"French reconnoitered around the enemy's left flank
on January 10. He advanced from Slimungers Farm on
January 11 with cavalry and horse artillery to bombard
the Boer laager east of Colesberg Junction, but was un
able to outflank the enemy. Reconnoissance of cavalry
and mounted infantry pushed north of Bustards Nek and
examined the country north of the ridge.
"Gatacre reports no change. All was well on Decem

FRENCH NOT TO BLAME
FOR ROUT OF SUFFOLKS
LONDON. Jan. 15.â A dispatch to the
Daily News from Naauwpoort. dated
January 9. describing the unfortunate
march of the Suffolk?, says:
"General French permitted the attempt
at the urgent desire of Lieutenant Colo
nel Watson. The march began at mid
r.iglu. The men wore canvas shoes, or.
failing in thesp. marched in their socks.
The ground was difficult ar.d many halts
were necessary to verify the position.
"On reaching the summit of the hill the
officers advanced over the crest to recon
nolter. The Boers, who evidently had
been warned of the movement, opened a
terrible fusillade. Captain Brctfs com
pany charged into a Boer trench, when
came an order to retire. It came In a
shout from the Boer lines and the two
rear companies, complc-tley deceived, car
ried It out.
"Of the two advance companies ninety
two were killed or wounded. Captain
Brt-tt grot his men under cover and sent a
sergeant with five men to cut his way
out and to ask the British artillery to di
rect the fire to the right, fearing that the
guns might open on him. Three men got
through with the message, but Captain
Brett was forced to surrender with his
remaining fifty-two men.
"The redoubt behind which the Boers
were lying was very high and doubly
loopholed. but absolutely unGiscoverable
exct-pt by balloon and too high to be
ttormed with, scaling ladders."

ITe fired on. he as well as I. and tried tÂ»
get cover behind three great blocks of rock,
when, a lyddite shell burst close to us and
covered us with earth and stones. The gen
eral withdrew us a little back. At this mo
ment one of my neighbors was hit In the side.
But he had strength enough to get to his horse
and galloped off. â¢
We were now fighting on the kopje with only
the general, and the kiltltea were still advanc
ing and crushing us in a clrcl*. At fifty yards'
distance we were still firing on them. Just
then the general fell. The group around; mt
was reduced to eight, of whom three werÂ»
wounded. My friend. Van Niekerke. had been
wounded In the wrist, but he kept en flrins
with his left hand, resting his gun on h!s right
arm. We could neither carry away th<Â» gen
eral nor defend him anj our cartridges were ex
hausted.
"What now?" asked Coghlll. while wÂ« looked
at each ether.
One of the wounded said: "We must raise
the white flag."
Coghlll answered with a curse. The balls
whistled all around us. Something had to be
done.
"Well" gald one of the woundedâ CoghlM com
pleted the phrase. "We must run for It."
"Good luck." cried the general, who was
seated on the ground, and pale as death. TV*
threw down our guns and everythins: that might
delay us and rushed down the kopie. for It was
a case of savins our own skins. Two bodies
of the advancing English troops were within "CO
yards of each other. I ran down between them
without turning my head to right or left. ThÂ«
bullet* gave me wings. I don't think that I
ever ran so quick. I was lucky enough to pÂ»t
in the horse 3 without being hit. I could
not find mine, but I got hold of another. Then
off I went on him and managed to get clear
of the Lancers, who were pursuing us. I
passed the night In an abandoned Kaffir kaarl
and the next morning managed t-> Join the com
mando of VHJoen. I don't know what became
of my comrades, but I hope that they were as
lucky as I was.
The Standard and Digger News glws
this picturesque account of the departure
of a commando from Pretoria:
The parade of 400 sturdy warriors of the po

which U once asaln contested. Tou are not

One of the soldiers rescued from tha
wrecked transport Ismore writes:
The most satisfactory part of the wholÂ»
business baa been the splendid behavior of aM
the troops. They were as steady and quiet a*
If we were raradlnsc in the barrack square.
Every man stood In his proprr place. There
was not the slightest confusion or hurry, and
they did exactly as they were told.
Th<?re Is not the least Joubt that It Ist owlns
to thetr splendid discipline that all were saved.
Had there been the sllshtest panic a dreadful
loss of life must have occurred, as getting thÂ»
boats off was a most difficult business, owlna
to the heavy swell, ami when they yere launch
ed they leaked, so that half an hour's bailing
had to be done before we dared let them start.
Everythlns had to bÂ« done by the soldiers, as
the ship's crew were all employed In trying to
put the water tight door to keep the st*a
out of the engine room. If It hod sot In thers
before the tires wÂ»re put out a dreadful ex
plosion would have occurred, and the ship
would have been blown in half.
The Modder River battle, with its many
dramatic incidents. Its heavy losses, its
long duration, proves a never failing topic
of the war correspondent lucky enough
to have witnessed it. Julian Ralph. In
the Daily Mail, gives a lengthy and vivid
account of this engagement.
"A common reliance of the Boer." he
writes, "was upon empty gin bottles. Bot
tles still containing gin and one full bot
tle of that liquor were to be seen stuck
in the loose dirt of the trenches."
Speaking of the Boer losses, this cor
respondent declares:
First In the mind of the Boer !a the destro
to hide his dead and to lie about their num
ber It la from their own that they most de
sire* to hide the truth. The prisoners we took
all said only eizhteen had been killed, but de
serters said the loss of life was very great an.l
that In the river alone 100 were sunk with
weights For my part. I shall not be surprised
If we learn seme day that In killed alone tbÂ»
Bders lost quite 330.
After every battle the veldt has been dotted}
with Boer horses In consequence of the custom
of bringlns two horses for each well-to-do
man and in consequence of the loss of riders
by death and wounded. But both previous
battlefield* combined showed no such number
of riderless horses aÂ» Modder River There
were literally hundred* of them. I had lost
mine In the fl*ht. but In the flrst half hour
of the next mornln* I took my choice of four
and mlcht have- made my pick from a hundred,
saddled and bridled, before I had son* hair
over the field. _,

NOT SATISFIED
WITH THE REPLY
OF SALISBURY
England Dodging the Issue in
Respect to the Seizures of
American Flour.
Returns an Evasive Answer to Secretary Hay
and Holds to Her Position Regarding the
Right of Search.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 14. -This
Government Is not nearly so
well satisfied with Great Eri- ]
tair.'s answer in respect to the
flour celsnres as earlier dis
ratchep indicated. The concessions are
far from being what was represented on
the day Embassador Ohoaie was pivrn the
IJrStish reply. The statement of the char
acter of the reply was made public In ]
London. This statement was cabled to \
the United States and printed before Em- j
basrador Choate could reach the Emba c - ;
:y and put in cipher the purport oftlic
communication ma-ie to him by Lord Sal- i
isbury.
According to the Inspired nexn Great. !
Brttaia had. with pieax-lns promptness,
peceded to the American contention that
food supplies v.-ere not contraband and
bad released the flour. Su~h information
was calculated to stimulate cordiality in j
the United States toward Great Britain,
e?-;.eoially In view <-f the fact that no such
concessions had been made in response
to the representations of the German Gov
t rnment. When Knibassador Ohoste's dis
patches came along and were translated,
however, the President and Secretary Hay
were surprised to learn the British an
*wer did not at all justify dispatches
which had been sent out from London and
which had been accepted as reliable by
the United State? Government as well as
by the people. The British answer was
not conclusive. It was rather evasive. It
was satisfactory only to the extent that
It did not directly deny the position taken
by this Government and left the way open
for further diplomatic negotiations.
ltÂ«is a question of no small concern to
the administration that the public has
been so misled by the London dispatches,
which were evidently given unwarranted
coloring by British authority and appar
ently intended for effect upon public opin
ion in this country. The situation. is ag
gravated, too, by the fact that a resolu
tion was offered in the Senate calling for
information regarding the flour seizures
on the very day the misleading report was
sent out from London. The statement
that Great Britain had acknowledged the
justice of claims of this Government was
accepted by everybody as the end of the
affair.
From Embassader Choate's official dis
patches the incident is r.ot closed by any
means. The truth is that Great Britain
holds to a position regarding the right of
search and seizure as unsatisfactory to
the United States as to Germany. The
latest instructions to Embassador Choate
show this Government is not pleased with
the answer of Great Britain.

? MAJOR GENERAL SIR JOHN CHARLES ARDAGH. f
T"pon this officer, v.-ho Is director of the military Intelligences department,
headquarters of the British army, is falling the brunt of the blamo for the
lack of information as to the numbers, equipment, etc., of the Boers, which
ft Is claimed has been the main cause of the several disasters that the
British forces in the field have met with. General Ardagh is in his sixtieth
year and has had forty-one years of experience in the service, having entered
as lit-utenant of the Royal Kngineers in 1559. lie was in the Intelligence
branch of the headquarters staff from 3STC to 18S1. and then sent on special
service of much importance to Turkey. As major he went through the cam
paign of ISE2. including the battle of Tel-El-Ivebir. and won mention in the
dispatches and brevet of lieutenant colonel, with the Egyptian medal and
the Khedive's Star. Again with Sir Gerald Graham in the Soudan campaign
as commanding engineer and D. A. Q. 11. G. in the intelligence department
h<Â» twice won mention in the dispatches and the C. B. with two additional
clasps to his Egyptian medal. In the Khartoum relief expedition he com
manded the base at Cairo, and again won mention, with the brevet of
colonel. In lfcSs he again won mention for the sixth time in the action at
GirJss on the Upper Nile. In JBS7 he was colonel on the start in Egypt,
then pri\'&te secretary to the Viceroy of India and later aid de camp to the
commander in chief. In 1525 he was made commandant of the Military
School of Engineering, one of the most honorable and best prizes that one
of hi 3 service can reach.
Binre April, litfG, he has been in the all-important office that he now holds,
and it is a matter of no small surprise and regret to his friends and the
public generally that anything should have been allowed by him to occur
tending to cast a shadow on the close of hla long and brilliant career.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Work was formally begun on the new
Admiralty harbor works at Dover on De
cember 15, when the first block of con
crete, weighing forty tons, was laid.
The German navy estimates provide
$750,000 for reseive ammunition and money
to bepin the construction of two drydocks
at Wilhelmshafen and one dock at
Danzig.
The British torpedo-boat destroyer
Earnest recently grounded at Tangier,
and after having got off managed to do
21 knots easily, with one engine and two
after-boilers.
The Deutche Flottenverein, which cor
responds to the British Navy League, has
Just issued its first annual. The book
contains matters relating to the navy and
merchant marine of all countries and has
plans of naval vessels drawn to a scale
of 1.1000. The apparent chief object of Its
publication is to show the necessity for
a larger increase of the German navy.
The Nljo, torpedo-boat destroyer built
for Japan, was launched, with steam up,
from the Yarrow yards December 16 last.
Two days later the boat had a prelimi
nary trial and made 31.206 knots, and on
the 21st the official three hours 1 trial at
sea came off, during which she averaged
31.15 knots, with an air pressure of les3
than one Inch. The boat carried a load
of thirty-five tons.
The Italian navy will be augmented dur
ing the present year by the commissioning
of the battleship Ammiraglio di St. Bon,
the armored cruisers Varesa, Vettor
Plsani. Garibaldi and torpedo cruisers
Agordat and Coatlt, besides six torpedo
boat destroyers and several torpedo-boats.
Work will be hurried on the battleships
Reglna Margherita and Ammiraglio Brin,
now in course of construction, and plans
are nearly completed for six cruisers of
one type.
A trial of the 5-lnch armor for the Rus
sian battleship Retvlzan. building at Phil
adelphia, gave very satisfactory results.
The plate was backed by twelve inches of
oak, behind which were two flve-elghths
inch skin plates, and the projectile used
was a 5-lnch shell weighing fifty pounds.
Five shots were fired with velocities rang
ing from 2057 to 2099 foot seconds, giving
blows varying from 1466 to 1327 foot tons,
and none of the shells penetrated the
plate more than two inches and the heav
iest blow dishing it not to exceed one
quarter inch. The plate was made by the
new Krupp process.
The British Admiralty has discontinued
the use of training ships fitted with sails,
and substituted modern cruisers without
sail power. This action has, of course,
aroused naval officers to give vent to their
feelings and opinions regarding the merits
of the training system under the old and
the new plan. The London Times of last
month contained columns of views ex
pressed, the older officers generally disap
proving of the new system, but Admirals
Hopkins and Erskin evidently realize that
with the departure from old fighting
methods, steam having supplanted sail,
etc.. a different system of training Is
needed. Admiral Hopkins thus expresses
himself: "Seamanship as understood by
the handling of a ship under sail has gone
by the boards, and the training of a few
officers and men for short periods In a
Townsend's Cal. giaca fruits, 50c R>, at
735 Market St.. will move tack In Febru-
ary to Palace Hotel, 633 Marke-c st. â¢

ripped steamer will never restore the lost
art." In the United States navy opinions
differ amons officers as to the merits of
sailing-ship training and practical ex
perience to be gained in a modern vessel.
A sailing training ship, the Chesapeake,
has just been built, and the Navy Depart
ment has recommended the construction
of two vessels with auxiliary sail and
steam power for training purposes.
Fourteen torpedo-boat destroyers were
added to the British navy last year. They
were all of the 30-knot class and ranged
from 300 to 224 tons. Their trials were a
continuous run of three hours under full
power to establish their speed, and a run
also under full power to ascertain their
coal consumption. The names of the
boats, with average horsepower, speed
and coal consumption, are as follows:

AUCTION SALES
LABOR IN HAWAII.
pi^OLLOWIXG close upon introduction of the
j bill to erect a territory in Hawaii comes a labor
report submitted by Harold Sewall, ,the spe
cial agent of the United States at Hawaii.
We have no light on Mr. Sewall's functions, nor
what is expected of a special agent of this country in
Hawaii, but this report is of the deepest interest to
American labor and to American employers. His
conclusions are in favor of contract labor. He says
that the ordinary manual labor there is performed
by unskilled workmen, contract and free, divided by
nationalities among the Japanese, Chinese, Portu
guese, Italians, Hungarians and Hawaiians. He de
nounces free labor as fluctuating and uncertain; be
ing free to work or not, the free laborer may be here
to-day and there to-morrow, always shifting about.
He reports that while free men receive more
per day than contract men, they are always liable to
be discharged at a moment's notice, and their posi
tion is precarious because distrust between employer
and employed is mutual. The naivete of this state
ment is amusing. Very naturally a free laborer dis
charged at a moment's notice when his employer
can replace him by bond labor is likely to be shifty,
here to-day and there to-morrow. Very naturally,
too, he may distrust an employer who hires him only
under necessity, to discharge him and take a bondman
in his place as soon as he can get one.
Any American sees at a glance that the purpose
and tendency of uncertain employment of free men
are to force them to become bondmen. Mr. Sewall
then proceeds to portray the happier condition of
the bondmen. They get 50 cents a day and
arc bound for three years. Women get 25 cents
a / day, and only time actually spent in labor
is paid for. Xo pay is given during disability
by sickness or other cause. The plantation time
keeper registers each one's time accurately and
all are paid by his roll. An overseer leads them out
in gangs in the morning and gives the signal to be
gin and to cease work. Mr. Sewall says his busi
ness is to "stimulate the lazy"; whether this is done
by a club or by persuasion is not specified.
The special agent says these contract laborers are
happy. The mother takes her baby to the field with
her, which is surely a privilege to be prized. Some
times, he admits, there are outbreaks when thump
ing on a tin pan calls the noisy crowd together. The
cause is usually the beating of some laborer by the
overseer. These difficulties, however, are usually
settled by a little tact and work is resumed. He
admits that these bondmen sometimes desert. To
use his own language: "Accumulated debt is a pro
lific cause for desertion and pure laziness is another.
These and the prospect of better wages entice many
away from their contract master."
Mr. Sewall (rives- in detail the process of getting

i contract laborers. The principal importations are
I from Japan. All who present themselves as bond
men undergo a rigid physical examination, as the
planters desire no weaklings. If sound and heaithy
the laborer is received by the immigration company
and is sent to Hawaii, "in better style than he could
command if he were free." On landing, his photo
graph is taken to identify him if he run away. This
is doubtless also set down as a luxury. If single men
| they are quartered in barracks with from six to forty
in a room. A Japanese family is furnished "with a
! small rcom."
The report is fall of great interest. It is plainly in
spired by what is intended as the settled policy of
employers in Hawaii. Having already 61,000 coolies
I imported since annexation, they seem indifferent to
I the impression made in the United States by use of
) the terms "free labor," "bond labor" and "master."
It is evident that besides the master's preference
j for bond labor, which makes the employment of free
' labor precarious, the physical conditions, the vertical
] sun, the tropical climate, indispose men to work when
I they are free to refuse, and they are reliable at labor
I only when under some form of compulsion. This
i report is made and published in Washington at this
time to aid the contention of the masters in Hawaii
that they must have coolie bond labor or they can
â¢ have none. They have perfect confidence that Mr.
i Sewal] represents the intentions of the United States,
! fo.- is he not special agent!
But what have American laborers and employers
!to say about it? Taking the case of employers who i
; are producing beet sugar in competition with cane
I sugar, how can they compete with employers in the
'i tropics who paj- 50 cents a day to men and 25 cents
I to women and dock for storms and sickness or other
i causes of idleness? As labor cost enters vitally into
j the production of beet sugar and cane sugar, how
can the American employer hope to pay the difler
; ence in wages between the American and Hawaiian
i scsle and make a profit?
Turning to the laborer's side of it, every pound
of product of Hawaiian bond labor displaces a pound
i of product of American free labor, and therefore dis
j places free labor. As far as employer and laborer
j are both concerned there are two remedies. One is
the extension of American iabor laws, anti-contract,
eipht-hour day and all, to Hawaii. The other is 50
cents a day for the American laborer and 25 cents for
his wife, with the privilege of taking her baby into
the field with her.
The Call had a most intimate knowledge of Ha
waiian conditions, and knew the effect of a vertical
sun and tropical conditions upon white men and pub
lished them before annexation. We warned the peo
ple of just what appears in Special Agent Sewall's
j official report. But certain American newspapers
were then dilating on the "Paradise of the Pacific"
and pointing American laborers to vineclad cottages,
in eternal summer, under the palm groves of Maui.
i They had their way. The annexationists prevailed,
and the cottage and American labor and wages have
become a dissolving picture, and in their place is the
j hard reality of bond libor sen-ing a "master." com
t pellcd by an overseer, and getting 50 cents a day when
j not docked for leaving a stint unfinished.
We now desire to say that as Special Agent Sexvall
i reports the labor situation in Hawaii, so it will be
j in the Philippines. Porto Rico, Cuba and even' square
inch of tropical territory we buy or steal. Nature
is not fickle and her laws are fixed. There has never
j been any highly productive labor in the tropics cx
j cept bond labor; none work there except on com
pulsion, and we enter the tropics with the employer
as a master and labor as a bondman, to be urged by
the whip and killed on revolt.

war, however, that is puzzling to the veterans of our
Civil War, and they are continually asking explana
tions of it. .
The cause of surprise is that the advance on either
side should be stopped by such a comparatively small
loss as is reported in the dispatches from the British
or such as come from Pretoria. Why should Buller
abandon an attack upon the Boer positions when his
loss in killed, wounded and missing all told did not
exceed 1000? Why should the Boers after a victory
in which their loss was comparatively trifling remain
in their intrenchments instead of profiting by the
British demoralization, and by an advance in force
all along the line turn the repulse into a decisive vic
tory?
By way of illustrating the difference between the
method of fighting during our Civil War and that
which now prevails on both sides in South Africa
statistics have been compiled and published in con
siderable numbers. They shdw that Americans
stormed heights fully, as formidable as those which
confront Buller or Methuen, and did not deem them
selves whipped on either side until the losses were
really so heavy as to make further effort useless.
Some of these statistics, compiled by a correspondent
of the New York Sun, are particularly instructive on
the point.
The writer, who quotes his figures from the records
of the War Department, says:
In one action one Union regiment lost S2 per cent.
Three Union regiments lost between 70 and 80 per
cent.
Seventeen Union regiments lost between 60 and 70
per cent.
Forty-one Union regiments lost between B0 and 60
per cent.
These numbers are all taken from the muster rolls
on file in the War Department, where each man is ac
counted for by name.
The severest loss was by a Confederate regiment at
Gettysburg, 720 out of 800 men, or 90 per cent.
Another lost in one battle 82 per cent.
Three lost in one battle between 60 ai\A 70 per cent.
Nine lost in one battle between B0 and 60 per cent.
Twenty-nine lost In one battle over 50 per cent
That was fighting. It was war in earnest. It is
never safe to charge whole armies with cowardice,
and both the British and the Boers have long since
established a reputation for valor. It is safe to say,
however, that if Grant and his men had undertaken
to relieve Ladysmith they would never have turned
back from Tugela River after a loss of less than one
man out of twenty, and that if Lee and his army had
been in the place of the Boers on that day they would
never have permitted a retreating foe to get away
without a countercharge to hurry them in their going.
By effecting an organization for co-operative pur
poses, the fruit growers may not devise a means for
owning the earth, but they will at least keep them
selves from being crowded off it
A PUZZLER TO AMERICANS
OWING to the distance from us of the war in
South Africa and the rigid censorship exer
cised over- all reports sent out from the front
it has been impossible to form a clear idea of the dif
ficulties with which each side has had to contend. It
is known that the British have not been able to ad
vance to the relief of the beleaguered garrisons, and
that the Boers when victorious in repulsing the Brit
ish have never ventured to follow up the victory.
There may be good and sufficient reasons for this
hesitation on each side, and judicious critics, in the
absence of fuller information, will not undertake to
condemn the inaction. There is one feature of the

A SLIGHT LULL IN TRADE
EASIER monetary conditions prevailed last
week. The Bank of England reduced its rate
of discount from 6 to 5 per cent and the Bank of
France reduced its rate to 4 per cent, these reductions
showing a relaxing money market in both countries.
In JCew York more disposition to put out funds was
shown, but borrowers were indifferent and inclined to
hold ofl for better rules. The cause of the relaxation
:n New York was the return of $4,000,000 from the
tnteric r, further deposits by the Treasury and more
liquidation in speculative stocks, while the banks re
p :ui zr. --crease in commercial loans.
There was another marked feature last week. The
: ::?':: :o buy goods, which characterized trade through
1 ct the whole calendar year of 1599, with the excep
tion of one brief lull, seemed to have subsided. The
:'ac: is. prices are so high that merchants are becom
ing cautious about ordering ahead. This is especially
the case in woolens, cottons and boots and shoes. The
raw material is so dear that the manufacturers arc
arable to corr.e out even on their product without
further advancing quotations, and the opinion is
growing that the public cannot stand much more ad
vance without a corresponding increase in wages, etc.
This condition resulted in quieter markets for wool,
cotton, hides and leather end a number of ininor lines.
But while clothing goods are quieter and less firm
there has been a radical improvement in many food
stuffs. Provisions have gone up freely at Western
markets in consequence of a growing scarcity in hogs,
cofTee has alfo advanced, oxring to the outbreak
of the bubonic plague in Brsril. But the general ten
dency of the week was toward quieter markets all
around. This is shown by the country's bank clear
ings, which decreased 3.5 per cent from the corre
sponding week last year. P.ut the failures decreased,
: umbering 274. against 318 last year. The cereal
markets continue disappointing. Wheat still declines,
though slowly, and the shipments of wheat and flour
from Atlantic ports are the lightest for several years.
In fact, corn is the only cereal to exhibit any strength.
As for wheat, the prospects are so good and stocks
so larpe that even an occasional rumor of the fall of
Ladysrr.ith or some disaster to the British arms else
where has thus :ar produced no effect on the "market
other than a dry smile on the faces of operators
On this coast the situation is featureless. A week of
dry weather, accompanied with north winds here and
there, has fr:ven the ground a chance to dry out some
Â¦vhat, and farming operations have been renewed in
light soils en hieh land. All reports from the interior
point to large crops of fruit and grain this year, bar
ring the spring setbacks, which do not always occur.
*!or.ey is in abundant supply and the tendency in in
terest rates is downward, while solvent borrowers can
get ioar.s anywhere. Collections are as good as they
ever fret, and 3ocal merchant* report a large business
in most lines. Provisions are leading st the moment,
:r. sympathy with the Western markets, and cereals
are frzll. as in other parts of the world. There is 3
very fair demand for spring goods of various descrip
tions, and no complaints are heard from any quarter.
The demand for fruit trees is reported very large by
the nurseries, ard prices for most varieties have been
nnteriafly advanced. This does not look as if Cali
fornia orchards were losing money, and, indeed, the
fruit grower probably made more raonev last year
than any other producer in the State.
THE HEPBURN CANAL BILL.
S~^ RATIFYING indeed is the report from Wash
( I ingcon that the House Committee on Inter
â* state and Foreign Commerce has ordered a
favorable report on the Hepburn bill for the construc
tion of the Nicaragua canal. From the strength of
the lobby which opposed any action on the measure
at this session of Congress it was feared that the bill
would not even come up for consideration, and that
the whole issue would be postponed until the report
of the Isthmian Canal Commission, which will not be
for a year at least. The action of the committee ren
ders it certain that the friends of the measure will
make an* earnest contest in its favor and by forcing
a debate will put Congressmen on record. Thus, if
the bill be not passed, people will at least know the
reason why.
It is well known that for some time past the
Panama Canal Company of France has been trying
to induce the United States Government to take up
that scheme instead of constructing a canal across
Nicaragua. A "campaign of education" has been
vigorously conducted in the interest of the scheme.
Some of the most influential papers in the country
have either given it a direct support or have opposed
the undertaking of the Nicaragua canal until the
Panama route should have been considered. The
recent organization of the Panama Canal Company of
America was an important step in the direction of
carrying that scheme to success. The prestige which
it had already acquired is vast, and should the pro
moters of it succeed in getting the Commissioners of
the Isthmian Canal Commission to show any kind of
favor whatever toward the Panama route we should
probably have a controversy that would divide the
advocates of the canal enterprise into two camps, one
favoring the Panama route and one the Nicaragua
route." That antagonism would of course entail long
delay and might defeat the measure for years to
come.
The bill as reported provides for a canal which shall
be wholly under the control of the United States Gov
ernment. Section I authorizes the President of the
United States to acquire from Costa Rica and Nicar
agua the control of such portions of their territory as
may be desirable "on which to excavate, construct
and defend a canal of such depth and capacity as will
be sufficient for the movement of ships of the great
est tonnage and draft now in use from a point near
Greytown, on the Caribbean Sea, via Lake Nicar
agua to Brito, on the Pacific Coast." Section 2 pro
vides that when the President has obtained control
over the territory he shall direct the Secretary of War
to excavate and construct the canal, and the final sec
tion provides that the sum of one hundred and forty
millions of dollars, or so much thereof as may be
necessary, be appropriated for the completion of the
It will be seen that the provisions secure about
all that has been contended for. They provide for a
canal owned by our Government, constructed by it,
and wholly under its control. The bill eliminates all
fear that the canal might be under the control of cor
porations or that the enterprise might be used for
the purpose of obtaining subsidies for a syndicate
of promoters.
Of course approval by the committee is far from
being approval by the House. The battle has not
been won. All that has been attained is success in
the preliminary skirmish.
The opponents of the measure are numerous and
strong, nor do they lack for specious arguments to de
fend their cause. It is always easy to find good rea
sons for delay. In this case it will be urged that since
an Isthmian Canal Commission has been appointed to
examine all the routes and make a report, it would
be best to delay action until they have completed
their investigations of the comparative merits of the
different routes. The one answer to that is that the
routes have been investigated again and again by
commission after commission, and it is not at all
likely the present one can add anything of importance
to what is already known to Congress. Nothing is to
be lost, therefore, by taking the measure up at once,
but much will be gained, for the need of the canal is
pressing and the sooner we get it the greater will the
benefits be.

AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS
FROM THIS COUNTRY
About Sixty Per Cent Find a Market
in the United Kingdom and
Its Dependencies.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â Frank H.
Hitchcock, chief of the foreign markets
division of the Agricultural Department,
has prepared an Interesting collation of
figures showing for the first time the re
spective amounts of our agricultural ex
ports which go to the several countries of
Europe and of the other continents. The
period covered is 1594 to IS9S. The state
ment shows that the agricultural products
exported from the United States duting
the five years had an average annual
value of $6tJ3,535,201. Of these enormous
.exports about 60 per cent found a markot
in the United Kingdom and its various
dependencies. The sum paid by the Brit
ish people for American farm products
purchased during the period mentioned
reached as high as $403,953,854 a year.
Great Britain alone took more than one
half of all our agricultural exports, the
consignments credited to that country
forming about 55 per cent 'of the total
shipments and having an average annual
value of $362,407,701.
Germany, which ranks next to the
United Kingdom as a market for the
products of American agriculture, re
ceived about 16 per cent of the exports
for 1594-98, the average yearly value
amounting to $56,320,264.
France, with purchases that averaged
J43,958,791 a year, or about 6.6 per cent of
the total, was the third country In im
portance. These three countriesâ the
United Kingdom. Germany and France â
received together nearly 75 per cent of the
total agricultural exports.
After the three countries Just men
tioned The Netherlands, Belgium. Cana
da. Italy and Spain afforded the most im

DIFFICULTIES AT ALVISO.
Rumor That McCann Will Surrender
His Contract.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 14.â Contractor Mc-
Cann, who has the contract for deepen
ing and widening Alviso Slough, Is meet-
Ing with all kinds of difficulties and It is
reported that he has abandoned his con
tract. The dredger, a patent of Capitalist
Jordan of Oakland, has not been made to
work since Its arrival at Alviso, a couple
of weeks ago. A large force of carpenters
have been at work since then making
changes and repairing. It is said that
Jordan and McCann have concluded It Is '

lose more on the work. Word has also
reached here from San Francisco in a let

SHAKESPEARE'S EARLIEST PRINTED WORK. "VENUS AND ADONIS."
WAS INTRODUCED TO THE PUBLIC BY THE ABOVE MOST INTEREST
ING DEDICATION.
rewarded, Injustice overcome, truth tri
umphant or Jealousy self-condemned. To
the reader of literature as distinguished
from the student of literature the simpler
Interest of the matter or underlying Idea
of a play will appeal more strongly than
a historical or analytical or critical study
of the book picked up for recreation or
amusement. It might, of course, be urged
that the great writers have composed
their works primarily for readers of this
type. As readers, then, with some leisure,
willing to be Interested or amused or di
verted from the ordinary affairs of lifeâ
as readers we should begin our acquaint
ance with such a play as "Coriolanus."
Fortunately for us, the difficulties In the
way of reading a play of Shakespeare's
a hundred years ago have been practically
cleared away. The text, at that time
more or less uncertain, ha 3 been fairly
well fixed; not that the text of to-day Is
the same as that printed in Shakespeare's
timeâ absolute faithfulness In this respect
would be Intolerable to the average read
erâbut that the reading of the lines has
been generally decided upon. The text of
"Coriolanus" Is perhaps less satisfactory
than that of other plays originally In the
quarto editions; "Coriolanus" was not
printed until 1623 in the first folio, while
we may fairly assume that the play was
written some fourteen years earlier. The
unsatisfactory character of the text Is
doubtless due to Imperfect copy from
which the play was printed In the first
folio. The editor of the second folio (1632)
made many changes in the textâ double
negatives and double comparatives, com
mon In Elizabeth's time, were changed to
fit the more logical If less historical gram
mar of modern English. Words that
seemed obsolescent to the editor of th*
second folio were changed to commoner
forms. The fifteen plays, moreover, that
had already appeared in quarto form had
been so altered In various editions as to
add to the confusion of the text.
It Is not surprising that Malone, one of
the greatest editors of Shakespeare, In
his variorum edition aimed to do little
more than establish the text. In his
preface Malone says that the two great
duties of an editor are to exhibit the
genuine text of his author and to explain
his obscurities. To Malone and his Inde
fatigable followers we are Indebted for the
clear text that may now be had almost
for the asking.
On opening "Coriolanus" one see 3 that
the characters are Roman; one recalls
other Roman characters In "Julius
Caesar" and in "Antony and Cleopatra."
These three plays naturally fall together
In the character of the matter involved.
Moreover, they are all three tragedies.
After reading the Roman historical plays
the student will find it interesting to com
pare the motives of the three, and in do-
Ing so the marked individuality of "Corio
lanus" comes out even more strongly than
in the first reading.
It is well in taking up a play to notice
the first impression given us of the chief
character. If it is of such a nature as to
excite in us opposition, the impression
may be so strong as to prevent that sym
pathy with the leading characters which
is so necessary to the force of tragedy.
In "Coriolanus," unless the reader Is
forewarned, such an Impression might be
madeâ ln this country, at any rate. In
the beginning of the first scene Calus
Marcius, later Coriolanus, is spoken of
by discontented citizens as a "chief
enemy to the people," "he's a very dog to
the commonalty, "let's kill him and
we'll have corn at any price." Maxclus,
when he appears before the citizens in the
same scene ([line 167) leaves no doubt In
our minds regarding his opinion of the
peopleâ not as individuals, it should be
observed, but as a crowd, as a mob.
Read also carefully lines 172-184. From
these and the rest of the scene it is evi
dent that Marclus is not on the side of
the gossips or the demagogues. His op
position to the people as a crowd, a mob.
Is quite evident In his invectives. Yet the
very intensity of his opposition chal
lenges our Interest: we wnnder what his
point of view can be and the reasons for
It.
In striking contrast to the relations be
tween Marcius and the people appear the
relations between Marcius and the Sen
ate. When war with the Volselans is an
nounced almost the first inquiry is for
Marcius. "We are made better friends with
Marcius by his answer to Comlnius, who
is to lead the Roman forces against the
Volsclans.
Com.â "lt Is your former promise."
Mar.â "Sir. It in; and I am constant."
As they bo off Coriolanus adds: "Noble Mar
cius!"
By faithfulness to his friends and In
spite of his opposition to the people Mar
cius now starts our sympathy and the
play is fairly begun. Upon the return of
Coriolanus to Rome his name is men-
HOAR'S SPEECH WAS
READ BY FILIPINOS
Massachusetts Senator Named as the
Man Whose Words Gave Hope
to Aguinaldo.
CHICAGO, Jan. 14.â John Barrett, ex-
Minister to Slam, for the first time pub
licly named Senator Hoar last night at
Lake Forest University as the Senator
whose anti-expansion speech was cabled
to Hongkong and subsequently put in tho
hands of the Filipino soldiers, causing, as
Mr. Barrett believed, the open insurrec
tion. Frequently this speech and its pre
sumed effect have been mentioned, and
the reading public has connected the name
of Senator Hoar with it, and it is prob
able that Mr. Barrett would not have used
the lawmaker's name on this occasion had
he not been facing an audience known to
be largely hostile to the administration's
policy in the Oriental islands. It appears
further from the ex-Mlnlster's speech that
the Government has discovered privately
the stages by which the anti-expansion
address reached Luzon.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.-Senator Hoar
to-night declined to take any notice of
the statements attributed to Mr. Barrett,
ex-Minister to Siam, in an address on the
Philippine question. The Senator said
that General Otis' reports gave the full
est account of the events that led to
hostilities, and that he expects, as he has
already given notice, to deal with the
whole matter In the Senate.
PROFESSORS TO FIGHT
PRESIDENT AYERS
Faculty of University of Cincinnati
Detetnnined to Oust the Execu
tive if Possible.
CINCINNATI, Jan. 14.-Thls has been a
day of anxiety among those connected
either directly or indirectly with the Uni
versity of Cincinnati. Following the
declaration of President Ayers that ihe
members of the faculty should all resign
and whereupon he would acept such res
ignations as he might select, comes a
movement on the part of the professors
to stand together, and not only refuse to
resign, but for all to quit if the trustees
at their special meeting to-morrow sus
tain the recent decree of President Ayer^.
The trustees last year before electing
President Ayers adopted a resolution giv
ing the president power to appoint mem
bers of the faculty and declare vacancies
With this power to discharge any mem
bers of the faculty no such coup d'etat
was anticipated as that of discharging all
members of the faculty at once. The pro
fessors are holding conferences, and have
not only decided to stand or fall together,
but also to imht I>r. Ayers to the lust.
One of them announced to-day:
"Every bridge has been burned. Even
if the trustees should refuse to sanction
what. has been done we would decline Â»o
be longer associated with Dr. Ayers. One
or the other must go."
President Ayers refused to say anything
In advance of the meeting of the board
to-morrow. The students, members of the
alumni and others have been industriously
conferring to-day with the trustees re
garding the crisis.
PONIATOWSKI'S PURCHASE.
Secures the San Mateo Electric Light
Plant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN MATEO, Jan. 14.â Prince Ponla
towski has purchased the San Mateo elec
tric light plant In Its entirety from the
stockholders of the company and will op
erate it until such time as his gigantic
power transmission line from the Blue
Lakes is completed, after which it will be
discontinued and supplanted by the new
line.
The increasing demand for light and
power for motors in San Mateo and vicin
ity has taxed the present works to their
extreme capacity and additional machin
ery would have been required in the near
future to supply the growing needs of the
consumers in this county not alone for
lights, but also pumps for Irrigating pur
poses, driven by motors.
The acquisition of these works is good
evidence that the great power scheme is
not a mythical undertaking, but a reality
and fast approaching completion.
From a reliable source of Information it
appears that the electric light plant at
Redwood City has also passed into the
possession or Prince Ponlatowski The
price paid for each of the plants, as also
any contemplated changes In operating
them has for the present been withheld
from the public.

Somewhere in his "Table Talk" Hazlttt

In the midst of authorities the student

the subject matter of which is his chief
concern. When a new novel comes out
it is more likely to hold our attention by
the action of the story, by the play of

the underlying Idea of the book: Virtue

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WALLA WALLA. Jan. 14.â William Lee of Ontario, In Northeastern Ore
gon, is preparing to develop a novel project by which he will almost attain
perpetual motion. He Intends to make use of a great head of steam gener
ated In the Interior of the earth for running pumps, which shall pump water
on a large scale for Irrigation purposes.
The steam now reaches the surface through a large artesian well between
Ontario and Vale. He has secured the water rights to this well, and will
pierce a subterranean steam chamber beneath by putting large steel pipes
down the well. The steam will then be piped to big steam boilers, whence It
can be drawn off as needed to operate the engines and pumps. To begin with,
several hundred horsepower will be generated. The pumps will elevate water
from the Malheur River, near by, for use in irrigating a large tract of rich
volcanic ash land, which needs only water to make it as productive as Walla
Walla or Yaklma valleys.
MUST KEEP PACE
WITH THE KAISER
Increase of American
Navy Urged.
Sreclal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â
In view of the purpose of the German
Emperor to force the passage of a bill
through the Reichstag practically doub
ling the German navy, officers of the navy
are hoping that action will be taken un
der which Congress, at the present ses
sion, will add three more battleships to
the naval programme.
"All information we have," sa.d an offi
cer, "point to the fact that the German
Emperor is urging the creation of such a
formidable fleet, not alone because of
European questions, but because of the
position the United States has assumed in
international affairs, in consequence of
the war with Spain. While our informa
tion respecting the proposed German In
crease is not entirely accurate, we under
stand that the programme to be proposed
will require the fleet to be increased dur
ing the next sixteen years by ten battle
ships and eight large cruisers, besides
twenty-seven substitutes and three new
ships authorized by the programme of
IS9S. with additional provision that sub
stitutes for the eight coast defense ships
of the Siegfried class shall be battleships.
This will practically result in doubling
the German naval strength. The new law
will provide lor a gradual increase, so
that in each year three ships will be laid
down. In each year there will also be laid
down three small cruisers and one tor
pedo boats divisions. Germany is apt
to be a nation with which many vex
atious quesi.ons will arise and the best
way to prevent war with her or any
other nation is by having a strong fleet.
In addition to the programme already
submitted, therefore, I hope that Con
gress will add three battleships, which
will give us an available baules^p lleet
of eighteen modern vessels."
Secretary Long is not in favor of any
further Increase in the programme he has
recommended contemplating the authori
zation of three armored cruisers, three
protected cruisers and twelve gunboats.
He bases his objection upon the fact that
Congress has not yet authorized armor
for the New Jersey class of battleships
and their construction cannot begin until
such authority is obtained, and to add
throe battleships to the pending pro
gramme would overtax the shipbuilding
resources of the country. The Secretary
does not believe that Congress would
authorize three additional battleships,
though he has been Informed that his rec
ommendations will be adopted.
Secretary Long has selected Captain J.
E. Craig, chief hydrographer, as com
mander of the cruiser Albany, which has
Just undergone successfully her official
trial in English waters. A crew is being
formed for the Albany, which Captain
Craig will take to England in the auxili
ary cruiser Prairie. A crew Is also being
formed for the battleship Kearsarge.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING-
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Jan. 14.â
Beet sugar Interests East and West are
organizing to prevent Congress following
the President's recommendations to abol
ish all tariff between Puerto Rico and the
United States.
H. T. Oxnard, president of the Ameri
can Beet Sugar Association, has been
here for some time, trying to make the
protest fe!t in the House and Senate.
"If President McKinley," said Mr. Ox
nard. "is going to drop protection to our
people, who are entitled to it, in order
to give it to carpet-baggers and specula
tors, we want to. know what has caused
the change of front. We purpose to make
as hard a fight as we know how against
the enactment of the President's recom
mendation regarding free trade with
Puerto Rico. We are coming to Wash
ington to carry this fight to the end, and
we purpose to call the attention of the
country to the injustice offered to a
worthy and extensive American Industry
by the President's recommendation.
"Tobacco growers will have representa
tives here h\ a few days representing not
only New England, but Wisconsin, Ohio,
Kentucky and tho Southern States. They
will make common cause with the beet
sugar men, who come from several States
of the far West, and join hands with the
fruit growers of California, and perhaps
some representatives of special agricul
tural interests and the Southern Atlantic
seaboard."
Whether the combination will make any
trouble for the administration managers
who are endeavoring to put the Presi
dent's suggestion into effect remains to
be seen. Representatives of similar coali
tion of other interests are vigorously
fighting the reciprocity treaties now pend
ing In the Senate. The opposition which
developed last week was so strong as to
discourage Special Commissioner Kasson
who negotiated the treaties, and he has
abandoned further effort in their behalf
and gone to Florida to recuperate his
health.

INDIGESTION ATTACKS
THE "HUMAN OSTRICH"
Surgeons Perform an Operation and Re

Special Dispatch to The Can.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.â John Sasel, 22 years old. is recovering rapidly In
St. John's Hospital. Brooklyn, from the effects of a surgical operation which
was performed to relieve a severe attack of indigestion. Sasel had swal
lowed rnar.y things which do not agree with the human system, and on Fri
day afternoon the doctors in the hospital removed from his stomach two
r.ickel watches, one brass watch, chains, two latch keys, six hairpins, 128
common pins, ten 2^-inch iron nall3 and one metal ring with a stone in it
There are some other pieces of metal still in his system, physicians say,
but It is impossible to find them and they do not believe they will do much
harm. It is a theory that even the articles which were removed would not
have caused trouble had not tho chains tangled them.
Ten days ago Sasel went to the dispensary connected with St- John's
Hospital, said that he had been a professional pin swallower for fourteen
weeks and asked for a cure for Indigestion.
On Wednesday last Dr. Hopkins made an X-ray examination. The plates
showed some small detached articles and one big black spot where the chains
had tangled up the pieces of metal. An operation was determined upon, and
on Friday afternoon Sasel, In whom the hospital physicians had become
very much interested, was laid on the table and an Incision made in the wall
of his stomach. After the cause of the trouble had been removed the wound
was sewed up and the patient put to bed.

ir.g of evidence in the contests for Gov- j
crnor and Lieutenant Governor will be
gin to-morrow. Under the rules already ;
adopted by the committee contestants are !
given four days in which to introduce j
their proof. The eontestees then are given j
live days in which to present their side, I
itnd one day Is allowed the contestants :
to bring in rebuttal evidence. Both sides j
are to .be given a reasonable time for ar- j
pument by their respective counsel. In ;
addition to the general counsel Mr. Goebel \
will have a special counsel, who will lock j
after his case when certain counts are j
being considered. Former Governor Brad
ley and Judge Yost of Lexington and i
Judge Humphrey will be among those |
who will look after Governor Taylor's
Senator Blackburn, who has been in
Washington for several days, will return
to-n!ght. It is stated he will assist Goebel
until the fight is ended.
The Republican leaders claim to have
encouraging news from the lawyers who
are representing the Republican con
ti-stees. They claim to have assurances
from that quarter that even should Gov- |
<-mor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor |
Marshall be unseated by the Legislature !
they will institute proceedings before I
Federal Judge Evans at Louisville to re- !
strain the Democratic contestants from !
taking the offices, and that a year or more j
will elapse before the case can be finally I
decided, as it will be carried up to the i
Haprcme Court, no matter how it mignt
Le decided in the inferior courts. Mean
while, they cay. the Republicans will hold
the offices.
Senator Goebel's attorneys and the Goe
bel leaders generally do not think there !
Is anything in this claim, as they insist
that no Federal question is involved, and I
the case, if filed, would have no standing
la the Federal courts.
Ex-Governor Bradley gave out an inter
view to-night In response to the charge
that he was in conference with the Re
publicans and the antl-Goebel Democrats ;
in Louisville prior to the election. He j
taid:
â¢'The statement that I wasÂ» the agent of i
a plan to confuse or terrorize the votars I
< f Louisville or to carry the election by !
fnrcf of arms or money is a malicious
falsehood. The statement that I was ln
<hioÂ«--d to take part in the campaign by
;>romise of the Senatorship lsÂ» also a delib- [
â¢ rate lie. I went into the campaign be
rausp I ff-lt it my duty to the party aaid
to the country, especially after the oppo
sition speeches and platform were leveled j
at my administration." 1
WILL SEARCH FOR
LOST TREASURE
An Expedition to Queen
Charlotte Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call
VAXCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 14.â An ex
j pedltlon is being- fitted out in Vancouver
j to hunt for gold in the bottom of a bay
jin the Queen Charlotte islands. Divers
i and a full set of diving- appurtenances
Â¦will be taken along by the party. Their
plan is to recover about $60,000 worth of
practically pure gold from the bottom of
what has come to bo known as Gold Bay
j on the western or Pacific Ocean side of
j the Queen Charlotte islands. Since July
i 2T, 1b57, Gold Bay has had a mysterious
name as the holder of a large amount of
i treasure. On that afternoon it is esti
j mated that $60,000 worth of gold was taken
I by three men from the shelf in the cliff
on tho flanking side of the rock-bound
! bay. The gold was scarcely in the hands
iof the men before it was lost again.
They had it partly lowered into their
boat, when a break occurred in their
tackle and the gold sank in over thirty
I feet of water. These particulars, together
j with other details of the expeditions that
! have vainly gone there in search of the
missing gold, can be found in almost any
pilotage record of the North Pacific.
The three men who found the gold were
in tho employ of the Hudson Bay Com
pany. They had been working over the
islands for weeks, but up to that time
had found nothing but some veins of
copper, some of which are now being de
veloped. Then on the day mentioned they
let themselves down over the cliff that
overlooked the landlocked bay. and in the
face of the rock they found" a pocket of
gold. The decomposed mineral which
they throw out with their picks was prac
tically pure gold. They were experienced
miners, and they estimated when they
had the pocket cleared out that therÂ«
was between MO. OOO and $70,000 in solid
cash beneath their feet. One story says
that they lost the gold In carrying it
down the cliff, while another statement
says that the yellow metal was thrown
off In a blast. But at any rate they lost
most of the glistening metal and ever
since then it has been resting in the !
bottom of the bay.
Several parties have gone north to
find it at intervals during the past few
years. The principal difficulty has been
to find where the gold was taken from,
and so far none of the parties have suc
ceeded in bringing but a small amount
back with them. The Vancouver firm
taking it up is Messrs. Armstrong &
Llewellyn. They depend on their diving
apparatus to make the work of finding
the gold easy. B

gTHE TIMELY USE OF%^
5SODA WATER MAN GETS IT IN THE PLEXUS.
/^j OLONEL" BRADT, the well-known eport. has at last won a fight. He
If has a record of fifty battles, forty-nine of which he lost. The
other was declared a draw on account of police Interference.
The first man to fall a victim to his terrible right or "a booze de
stroyer." as lie is wont to term it, Is Emile Somps, who is a familiar figure
on the "line."
Friday night Brady and Somps had a dispute which culminated in the
colonel challenging his adversary to put on the gloves with him. Somps,
who is over six feet tall and who has acquired considerable muscle through
handling bottles at his father's soda works, thinking the colonel was a
"puddin'," as he expressed it. readily accepted the defl. In order to mako
the bout more Interesting Somps offered to bet $20 that he would put Brady
to sleep in two rounds. The colonel promptly covered the bet, and accom
panied by several friends, they repaired to the Olympic Club, where they
completed arrangements for the "scrap." After considerable wrangling
"Billy" Kennedy was selected as referee. Eight-ounce gloves were used; as
Brady did not want to take a chance of having his face disfigured. At the
tap of the bell Somps, who knows something about the game through his
associations with the Alameda terror, and other prize fighters of equal
prominence, started to annihilate Â¦ Brady. The colonel cleverly dodged
several wicked swings by falling to the floor and staying down the allotted
ten seconds. Somps tried to land a knock-out blow, but the colonel either
hugged the floor or clinched to save himself.
At the end of the second round Brady â¢was still on his feet, demanding
another round. As Samps had no objection the colonel was given a "bracer"
and time was again called. Somps landed a hard right on the jaw, which
sent Brady to the floor in a dazed condition. He recovered before the ten
seconds were up and started in to do his opponent A hot mix-up followed,
in which the colonel was again Bent to the floor. After recovering from the
effects of the blow, Brady complained that one of his gloves had been dam
aged In the fracas. He walked over to Somps and placing the glove under his
nose asked Somps to examine it. Somps promptly dropped his arms. Intend
ing to look at the glove, when the foxy colonel landed his right . flush on
the big fellow's solar plexus, and he fell as though he had been struck by a
club in the hands of a south-of-Market-street policeman.
For a time it was thought he was fatally Injured. He recovered, how
ever. In a short time, much to the relief of Brady, who was momentarily
expecting to be arrested for murder. The colonel was awarded the fight and
stakes, against the protest of Somps and his seconds.
Brady's friends on account of the great victory are seriously thinking
of matching him with the Sausalito toothpick for a side bet of $1000.

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW ORLEANS. Jan. 14.-Jockey Pete
Clay is insane and has been removed by
friends to a private sanitarium in this
city. Clay's affection Is due to a fracture
of the skull which, with other serious
bodily injuries, he received in a fall from
a horse in Montreal in July, 189 S. His
life was despaired of at the time, but he
pulled through after four months in the
hospital and last year turned up at the
Chicago tracks, where he put in the
spring and early summer, riding as well
as he ever did. Going East in July he
joined Harness & Brossman's stable and
was given the mount on Imp in all her
Important races. It was noticed at Wash
ington he was slightly unbalanced, but
as he was a hard lad to understand at
any time nothing was thought of It until
after coming here he showed unmistak
able signs of insanity. His hallucination
Is that he is still riding Imp. and he Is
constantly raving about the mare.

RAWLINS IS
VICTOR ON
THE LINKS
Wins the Professional Golf
Tournament Handily After
a Close Contest.
Under a gray sky, not alluring to merÂ«
spectators, but pleasant to tha eyes of
golfers and favorable to good play, the
professional tournament on the Oakland
links was brought to a conclusion yester
day. The rlrst place and with It the
prize money of $100 went to Horace Raw
lins, whose score for the second eighteen
holes was exactly the same as for the
rlrst two roundsâ S4. His total for thirty
six holes was thus 16S, giving him a lead
of' 6 over Alexander Smith, whose score
was 44 for each of the two last rounds
and 174 for the thlrty-slx holes. J. Mel
ville and David Stephenson were close on
the heels of Alexander Smith, having lib
each. \V. Anderson was but one stroke
behind these two, his score being 177- T.
W. Tetley played a better game than on
the tlrst day of the tournament, making
some pretty drives, but his Ftrokes lacked
vim; though his score of 43 for the Jast
nine holes was but two behind Rawlins'
score of 47 for the second nine holes. The
winner's score of 37 for the llrst nine and
40 for the last nine were the best two
rounds of the tournament. Rawlins
drove brilliantly, played well through the
green and made nome excellent approach
shots, but was a little off In his short
game, missing some easy putts. The
competitors were paired off as follows:
Alexander Smith and \V. Anderson. D.
Stephenson and J. Melville, H. Rawlins
and T. W. Tetley. The Jlrst pair started
â¢soon after 10:30 o'clock in the morning,
being followed at short Intervals by the
others. The thirty-six holes were finished
shortly after 1 o'clock, D. Stephenson and
J. Melville starting almost immediately
on another elghteen-hole trip to decide
the tie. Stephenson did the first nine
holes In 44 and Melville In 45, so that it
was still anybody's game. Stephenson,
however, made the second nine holes in
47, while Melville's score was 40. The
young San Francisco Club professional
accordingly won third money by three
strokes. The total scores for all the four
rounds (two played on Saturday and two
yesterday) were as follows:

REV. J. A. B. WILSON MAKES
APPEAL TO CITY OFFICIALS
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson of the
Howard-street Methodist Church In his
discourse on "Things to Como" last even-
Ing made an appeal to the Supervisors
and Police Commissioners to make and
enforce a law by which the saloons of
this city may be controlled. He advo
cated the closing at midnight of all places
where liquor Is sold and the abolishing of
all side and private entrances; also to
have all saloons closed on the Sabbath.
"Side rooms and private apartments
should be abolished," said he. "It is in
these places where the evils of the com
munity are hatched and matured. Inno
cent young women are led into these
pitfalls of the devil to be ruined for life.
Three-fourths of all evils that are per
petrated In the community take place in
the saloons after midnight. It is in these
places where robberies, bloodshed and
other crimes are conceived, when respec
table and God-fearing people are at tneir
homes and in their beds. The new Board
of Supervisors will have to re-enact all of
the ordinances and the Police Commis
sioners have full and complete control
over the Issuance of liquor licenses. Then,
It Is not asking too much to have these
two boards properly regulate the sale of
intoxicants within the city limits."
A CLEAR CONSCIENCE BRINGS
GREAT JOY AND CONTENTMENT
Rev. F. B. Cherlnffton delivered a ser
mon on "The Authority of Conscience" to
the congregation of Plymouth Congrega
tional Church yesterday morning. Tie
said:
Conscience 1Â» the most mysterious yet most
vividly real and potent thing in man's nature.
Round up inseparably with the deepest and
best things in our constitution 1b a recognition
of the authority of the little word "oueht."
To obediently regrard it brings a sense of peace
and Â«atlsfafctlon to the Inner life. To disre
gard it is to Illnu sand Into all the delicate
bearings of the moral machinery of our being
and destroy its finest working, and ultimately
bring ruin to It all. This conscience la an un
welcomÂ© companion with the man who has
settled It with himself that he will stick at
nothing: which would hinder him In money
gettlnff. plaee-seeklns or pleasure-hunting;. He
Â¦who socks to silence It by searing in with a
hot iron or by smothering: it or killing It out
right has already sold himself to Ratan. ThÂ»
beat In him Is dead and the worst Is In power.
The putting out of one'o own eyes or cutting
off one's own hands or feet is slight Â«elf-malm
lnc compared with that of killing one's con
science.* The only terms of peace with It are
unconditional surrender of heart and life to
its olain dictates. The thing nearest like
Eden on this earth Is a clear conscience. He
who Is driven out of Eden cornea back to It
only through a Gethsemane.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 14.-Rev. W. B.
Andorson. pastor of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church of this
city, figures in an Interesting epi
sode which. It is announc*yj, will
form the subject of Inquiry by the
presiding elder of this district. It ap-
I ear* thru iho clergyman's wife and
daujrht^r are visiting in the South and
p'.nco their departure he has made Xre
queni clerical calls at the homes of his
parishioners.
Tho Btory poos that \*ion he telephoned
to the homo of W. P. Thompson, a
plumber, a request for a ham and eggs
lir^jikfast. which he intended to eat with
ihA plumber'a wife, the husband became
|ratÂ« ar.il determined to put a stop to thÂ»
\>;- -mns of the preacher. That night
Thompson repaired to the locality of the
church and made a warlike demonstra-
Mnn ;^r:iins=t the elorpryman. exhibiting a
revolver of robust dimensions, which one
of the deacons had much difficulty In re
li rising from his irrlp. The story goes
that the clerp-yman made a bee line for
a harbor of safety, and that no prayer
trifling was held in the church that
night.
Thompson has since declared that the
Town is not big enough to hold himself
and the Rev. Mr. Anderson. The latter
came here from San FrandÃco come
months apo and created such a favora
ble impression that the congregation In
creased his salary. He is defended by
many of tho church people, among whom
Mrs. Thompson Is held in high esteem.

Suey Sings "Will Pay Â§200 for Each
Man They Killed, but Their
Rivals Ask Much
More.
The arbitration committee which has
been appointed to adjust the differences
that caused the tong war between the
Hop Sings and the Suey Sings met yes
terday afternoon and evening in the head
quarters of the See Yup Society at the
corner of Clay street and "Waverly place.
It consisted of three members of other
tongs and representatives of the warrine
factions were present. Until a late hour
last night nothing in tho nature of a
peaceful adjustment had been made and
the concensus of opinion among the
Chinamen Is that bullets will fly in the
Chinese quarter shortly after the holi
days, or before if tho police protection Is
The attitude of the Hop Sing Society
before and even after the treaty was
signed has been extremely warlike. They
lost four men on account of their mi
nority of forces, and just as the armis
tice wfre declared they were preparing
to take their revenge. A temporary ces
sation of hostilities was forced upon them
by the merchants on account of holiday
trade, and they consented to It with much
reluctance. On the day the treaty was
made an attempt was made to murder
one of their men in Marysvllle, and this
action enraged them so that for the past
few days they have endeavored to secure
possession of the compact they signed In
order to destroy it. In the event that they
were unsuccessful they intended to again
plungre into hostilities regardless of their
pledge.
When the committee met yesterday the
Suey Sings were ready with an offer to
pay the Hop Singrs $200 for each of four
men who were killed by them. This prop
osition the Hop Sings refused to listen
to. and after much threatening on the
part of the merchants in case they de
cided to continue hostilities, placed the
price at $500 per man, which is consid
ered exorbitant in tong wars, and which.
It is believed, they knew their rivals
would never consent to pay. The high
figure not being accepted, the Hop Sings
now have an excuse to continue the war.
INSTALLED US
THE SUCCESSOR
OF DR. STEBBINS
Rev. Dr. Leavitt Takes
Charge.
CHANGE IN FIRST UNITARIAN
>
THE FORMER PASTOR'S WORDS
OF FAEEWELL.
Exhorts the Young Minister to Gain
the Love and Confidence of His
Congregation So as to
Succeed.
The Installation services of the r.ew
minister, tho Rev. Bradford Leavltt. at
the First Unitarian Church yesterday
morning were sadly Impressive.
Rev. Dr. Stebbins, who for th,e . past
thirty-five years has presided -as- minister
of the church, retired formally from his
post and was succeeded by a ypung man,
who by his quiet yet earnest manner
made a deep Impression on the large con
gregation that had gathered to wit
ness the ceremony. In one part of thÂ«
service, when Dr. Stebbins and' the Rev.
Mr. Leavitt stood side by side on the
dais, Dr. Stebbins making hi 9 charge to
his successor, the contrast of the tw6 men
was very touching. Dr. Stebbins "with a
firm voice making his final farewell to tha
people whom he had loved, consoled and
advised for so many years i the Rev. Mr.
Leavltt, young in experience yet full of
Christian zeal, and with a face lit up full
of enthusiasm.
Dr. Stebbins said in part
â¢ "I do not wish to formally charge your
next minister with his duties. I do not
wish to mak any suggestions. All I wish
to tell him is that I know the success that
has met me In my work came because I
received the love and confidence of all the
congregation. I have never wanted my
parishioners to- be more than they really
are, and have only asked them to do their
duty the best they knew how. When f
have made mistakes I have recognized
the fact, and if I have Â¦wronged any one
I have always gone afterward and told
him I was wrong and asked him to for
give me. A minister can have no dissen
sions in his church if he has the love of
his people."
The programme of the service was as
follows:
Orsran prelude, "Offertolre" (Field). H. Bre
therick; anthem. "The Lord Is My Light"
(Parker), quartet and chorus; hymn 162. choir
and DeoDle; reading of Scriptures. Rev. Dr.

JAPAN PREPARING FOR
WAR WITH RUSSIA
Aggressiveness of the Czar's Minions
at Korea Given as the
Casus Belli.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
KOBE. Japan, Jan. 14.â That war be
tween Japan and Russia is Inevitable
hourly becomes more apparent. The casus
belli is, of course, the aggressiveness of
the Czar's minions In Korea. Russian
warships are wintering at Masampo,
Korea where Russian subjects succeeded
last fall In effecting a surreptitious pur
chase of 170 acres on the beach and where
Russia Intends building fortiilcations
which will control the harbor.
War materials are now being- gathered
and an attempt to erect forts will be the
signal for an outbreak. Tho Japanese
press, which is more or less under the
control of the Government at all tirm-s
denies there is any trouble brewing, but
every man of intelligence in the empire
knows the denials are diplomatic and in
tended for Russian consumption.
The Japanese army is being quietly
placed upon a war footing, and no navy
of any power ever was more ready tor
active operation than that now sailing
under the Japanese flag. And further
Russian demonstrations at Masampo will
be a signal for an outbreak.
So far as the army is concerned, it is
equipped with the most improved pattern
of rifles and plenty of ammunition.

I-adypmith Fays:
"The British made no attempt to hold
the first line of breastworks, but made
an exceedingly stubborn resistance at the
next row. Every inch was Ftubbornly
contested and conspicuous bravery was
displayed on both sides.
'â¢After 10 o'clock the British artlllerv
fire slackened, and a terrible individual
contest ensued emons: the riflemen for the
possession of Platt-Rand ridge. At noon
a heavy thunder storm interrupted the
battle, lasting two hours.
"Althnujrh the burghers succeeded in ul
timately gaining possession of most of the
British positions on the western side of
the Platt-Rand, they were finally obliged
to retire from most of the ground they
occupied. The British were the more
Ftrongly entrenched, th^ir redoubts hemg
still fully loopholed, and the combat was
fo close that rifles wore frequently fired
at arm's U-r.gih. It was a hand-to-hand
er.cmir.ter. with the m<>n on both sides
<*.(rhtinjf like demons, and the horror and
I'fwll^nnent of the scene could scarcely

THOUSAND DOLLAR DEFICIT.
The University Glee Club Played in
Hard Luck on Its Northern
Tour.
BERKELEY, Jan. 14.â The University
of California Glee Club came In from the
north to-night after what proved to be
one of the most successful tours, musi
cally, and most disastrous, financially,
that the club has ever taken.
The tour Included concerts at Marj-s
vllle, Red Bluff, Redding, Yreka, Ashland,
Albany, Salem. Grants Pass. Cnico. Port
land, Tacoma. Everett. New Whatcom.
Seattle and Eugene. The net loss on the
tour will amount. to a thousand dollars.
As the last year's management handed
down a deficit of some nine hundred dol
lars the organization seems to be threat
ened with serious difficulties. The boys
are not discouraged, however. Perfect
harmony prevails and the members ex
press a determination to go to worftrand
wipe out the debt before the cummer
comes.
pated to-day, the preliminary examina
tion before the magistrate will be held
later, and the trial probably will be con
ducted by the Supreme Court.
The colonial Dutch point out that these
prosecutions will serve to make more
rebels, as they consider the treatment of
the prisoners designed to terrify them.
Some Britons regard the prosecutions as
Impolitic, in view of the fact that the
Boers are able to retaliate upon the 100
British officers nnd the 2500 prisoners in
their hands and might do so unless all
who fipht in the Boer ranks are treated
as prisoners of wnr.
The Boers keep up a continuous sniping
near Dordrecht. Five colonial scouts
were captured on Monday.
Yesterday tho American residents gave
a dinner to Webster Davis. I'nited States

BOERS WILL AGAIN
ATTACK LADYSMITH
LO.VDOX, Jan. 15â A dispatch to the
Times from Lourenzo Marques says:
"The British Consul has issued a notice
warning British subjects against enlist
ing for service with the Boers, trading
with the republics or treasonable conduct
in the Transvaal. Herr Pott has protest
ed apainst this notice as constituting an
interference with the sovereign rights of
Portugal.
"Five thousand Boers werÂ« sent from
Xatal last week to defend the Free State
border and to resist the attacks of Gen
erals Gatacre and French, which are caus
ing some alarm. A leading- Transvaaler
fays that the Pâs will make another
desperate attempt to reduce Ladysmith."
The Standard publishes the following
from Ladysmlth. Thursday, January 11,
by heliograph, via Weenen:
"The Boers aro fortifying positions
north and west of 'Ladysmith. doubtless
with a view of securing a uafe line or re
treat should their opposition to General
Buller*s advance fall. Th"y still surround
Ladysmith in large numbers and may be
contemplating another attack. It Is
known, however that they are greatly de
pressed by their heavy losses. Prior to
Saturday they were perfectly confident of
their ability to defeat the parrison and to
take possession of the town."

WEBSTER PLANS
REORGANIZATION
OF THE SCHOOLS
Evening Teachers to
Be Discharged.
>
REGULARS WILL DO THE WORK
SALARY CONTROVERSY NOT YET
QUIETED.
?
All Elementary Committee "Work
Placed in the Superintendent's
Hands and Great Improve
ment Is Expected.
If the plans of Superintendent Webster
are permitted to mature, a thorough over
hauling of the local School Department
will Boon be begun, and as a result of it
a few short of half a hundred evening
school teachers will be given an oppor
tunity to look for someother employment
in which to spend their late hours. The
work, which under previous administra
tions has been done by the Elementary
Committee, was turned over to Mr. Web
ster by the last Board of Education and
the new board has given him practically
as much power. The reclassincation of
Echools and the readjustment of educa
tional facilities are now all planned by
him and laid before the board Â¦with his
recommendations for ratification.
Mr. Webster proposes to begin with the
evening schools. Two of them at least
will be closed. The Rincon and the Spring
Valley Evening schools are in bad condi
tion, and it is probable that they will
be abolished and the classes merged with
those in other districts. The abolition of
schools, however, is not the chief feature
of the Superintendent's plan; it is the
abolition of evening school teachers in
which he is interested, and in which is
centered the greatest interest of the regu
lar teachers of the department.
Nearly all of the evening school in
structors are regularly employed at some
other occupation during the day and take
the school work solely to augment their
Income. A number of them now in the
employ of the department are the recipi
ents of salaries of $150 per month. A num
ber of others are getting from $100. to $125.
They are working as clerks or.bookkeep
ers for downtown business houses and
some of them are practicing, lawyers. In
the opinion of Superintendent Webster
they are not fit for educational purposes
after they have had their minds wrapped
up all day in matters of business and he
thinks the money they are drawing would
b better placed if it were distributed
among the regular day teachers who draw
less salary. According to Mr. Webster,
education is their business and sole con
cern and he is planning to replace those
who are let out with day teachers, whose
salaries will be increased accordingly.
It is upon this plan of reorganization
that really hinges the fight that Mr. Web-
Bter is making to appoint his own depu
ties. He does not propose to let the Board
of education dictate his appointments in
order to pay political debts to the "or
ganization." If any dictating is done It
will be by the teachers themselves. Mr.
Webster is highly elated at the interest
and pride the pedagogues are taking in
his plans for improvement, and he con
siders that they know best who could ac
complish the larsest results In acting as
his assistants. Accordingly he proposes
that all of his deputies shall be chosen
from the practical working force. He has
already proffered appointment to three or
four of them, but they have declined to
give up profitable prlncipalshlps for the
puny salary which the board is attempt-
Ing to force upon them.
Mr. Webster, however, Is confident of a
satisfactory agreement. He has the sup
port, of President Cecil Mark, ex-Presi
dent P, A. Bergerot and Professor L. A.
Jordan, the present Assistant Superinten
dent, and at the meeting on Wednes
day he proposes to go before the board
and make a formal demand, unless it is
settled beforehand at another "dark lan
tern caucus."

Barkentine Planter From Honolulu
Quarantinedâ Made a Gooc. Run
Despite Damage -deceived
in a Storm.
The American ship Shenandoah is tack
here again from Sydney. N. S. W.. after
an absence of nearly a year. The big ves
sel has been in hard luck for a long time.
and this last voyage has been anything
but a profitable one for her owners. Kirst
of all she was on tire and that little affair
cost her a grain charter. Then she was
delayed on the Sound in getting a load
of lumber; delayed again in discharging
at Port Pirie, Australia; delayed again
in loading at Sydney. N. S. W.. owing to
a strike in the collieries, until now she has
been a year making a voyage that la gen
erally covered in from, seven to eight
months.
The Shenandoah arrived here from Bal
timore In command of Captain Starkey
about fifteen months ago. She was docked
at Mission street wharf, and soon after
the wi-rk of discharging her cargo of coal
began. After a few hours' work the ves
sel was found to be on tire in the fora
hold. It smoldered along for two or three
days and was finally put out. When the
coal was discharged It was found that the
Inside skin was badly charred and that
in one place the hull rvaa nearly burned
through.
After the S.henandoah was repaired she
went from here to loed lumber for Aus
tralia on the Sound. In order to complete
her cargo she had to go to several mills'.
and was in consequence a long" time in
setting away. She made a good run
across, but was detained at Port Ptrie
and then again at Sydney. From the lat
ter port she made the run to San Fran
cisco in the good time of sixty-two days.
When the Shenandoah was here last
the son of Captain Murphy of the Arthur
Sewall was chief officer of her. On her
arrival at Puget Sound Captain Starkey
went home and young Murphy was mads
captain. At that time he was very little
over his majority, and is now, as he waa
then, the youngest master In the Amerl-
The barkentlne Planter arrived from

BIBLE RISES SUPERIOR
TO ALL OF ITS CRITICS
"The Bible and Its Critics" was the title
of an eloquent Â¦ sermon preached at the
First Baptist Church last evening by Rev.
Dr. E. A. Wood. He upheld the authen
ticity of the Scriptures by stating that it
was easily susceptible of proof that tho
Old Testament, as we now have It, is
identical with the Bible of the Jews in the
time of Christ. Julian, Claus and Por
phyry he regarded as the first critics of
any note, and -he. said other strong-ly hos
tile critics did not arise until after the
Reformation. During the last half-cen
tury the chief method of attack has been
through the so-called higher criticism.
After a general review of the subject he
declared that the Bible had successfully
run the gauntlet of criticism for centuries
and was a more potent force for good to
day than ever before^
TWELVE APOSTLES DISCUSSED
BY THE REV. DR. MELANDER
Rev. E. Nelnnder of the First English
Lutheran Church last night preached on
"The Apostolic Duodecomvirate." He
said in part:
The apostles wrre plain men who had not
been perverted by the false philosophies, tra
ditions and morals of the day. They were
men of "the third estate," neither aristocrats
nor beggars. All were unlettered men. yet
men of ability. They were all townsmen, men
of affairs, accustomed to buoy, practical lire.
They were men of passions and Infirmities ralm
dtamonds. They were far from faultless, but
the faults were flaws in a Jewel, not the
crudenesÃ of charcoal. In a brood ami blessed
sense Christ has made all hla followers
apostle*.
FATHER SARDI DISCOURSES
ON THE MERITS OF LABOR
Tho Rev. Father Sardl preached last
evening at St. Ignatius Church on the
subject of "Labor." "Our blessed Lord
undertook," ho said, "to show that labor
was noble and lofty. He, the fountainhead
of all that Is beautiful, became a carpen
ter's apprentice. He was accomplishing
the will of God In this net, and no grander
one can be conceived. This is an act wa
can all doâ fulnlllng the will of God. The
street sweeper or the bootblack, if he Is
self-respecting, is as much worthy of your
esteem as the capitalist. Labor Is Indis
pensable. In the . Book of Genesis*. God
tells Adam that he shall earn his bread by
the sweat of his brow. What we should
do Is not work for this world, for this Is
only a short life, but look 'orward fo
the world to come. God is no r*-xi>ecter of
men, and the humble worker or laborer
In the world to como will bÂ«Â» welcomed by
our Father, who Judges his children by
their lives on earth."

ONE of the recent features of desert
mining progress in Southern Cali
fornia is the establishment of a
custom mill at Borax Lake, forty
miles from Johannesburg. It is a
rotary mill of about thirty tons' daily ca
pacity, and is nearly ready for operation.
The result of its operation, as of all such
new mining facilities where none existed,
will be the development of small â¢ mines
from which ore could not be Bhlpped so
far over a costly route to custom mill or
smelter. It is being put up by San Fran
dsco men, who have developed a supply
of well water. Miners of small means
within a few miles can now work small
quantities of ore and so be enabled to de
velop their claims if they have valuable
ore near the surface.
The - mineral resources of the Mojave
Desert are being rapidly brought nearer
to successful development and operation,
both possible and actual. The Randsburg
railroad thrust a new boom to the east
clear to the Panamint Mountains, custom
mills at Randsburg, Johannesburg and
Garlack set miners to digging as far on
ward as hauling ore was practicable, and
the development of subterranean water
supplies has recently given a new promise
to the region. The successful development
of new mines by capitalists in Southern
Inyo County has further drawn attention
and money across the desert and now a
continuation of the Randsburg Railroad
into Inyo County seems certain. That will
stimulate mining operations over a big
belt of untouched mineral riches. The
day of that desert's greatness Is nearing.
New York boulevards and the Mojave
Desert are two of the early patrons of the
automobile. The latter offers -a "big
field" for the beastless vehicle and needs
it. It already has a prospecting wagon,
driven by gasoline, and planned to carry
water, provisions, shelter, assaying out
fit, etc. The idea of gayly dashing over
the vast arid wastes, stopping anywhere
to hop out for samples which may be as
sayed en route, and feeling indepenent of
the next far away well, has charmed a
good many imaginative desert miners, and
it may be partially carried out. The im
aginative, however, might dwell on what
would happen if the thing broke down
sixty miles from anywhere.
Eig steam traction engines have been
successfully substituted for the pic
turesque twenty-muie outfits which have
so long nauled borax across the sandy
wastes, and their use is rapidly increasing
in this State and Arizona. It is hardly to
be doubted that oil, electric and other mo
tors will soon be adapted to the long des
ert roads and help solve the transporta
tion problem.
The Julian district In Ban Diego County
wants automobile freighters, and the mer
chants of Julian are agitating the subject
of putting several trucks in operation be
tween that place and San Diego to carry
both freight and passengers. It is said
that trips now requiring a day could be
made in olx hours, and several little towns
on the route are being canvassed in be
half of the project. Tnere, as elsewhere,
freighters, hay dealers and others inter
ested in established methods of transpor
tation are in active opposition. That is
the case up in Shasta County, where a
franchise for a steam traction line out of
Redding to a lumber camp is a burning
local question. Other automobile projects
have been started in California mining re
gions, and the probabilities are that the
automobile as an ore carrier will soon
figure in technical mining literature.
A good deal of current transportation
progress In California Is closely related
to the mining industry, as it needs to be.
The richest part of the mother lode, that
in Amador County, about and between
Jackson and Sutter Creek, is likely to be
reached by a railroad soon. David Gut
mann and some Eastern associates have
organized the Jackson, Sutter and Ama
dor Railroad Company and propose to
build a 35-mlle standard gauge road from
lone to the towns mentioned. The many
men interested in stages and freighting
outfits are presenting much opposition.
What a railroad would mean to these min
ing interests is indicated by the following
from the Amador Ledger:
"The Impassable condition of the wagon
roads and the congestion of freight at the
lone depot, all destined for points along
the mother lode, are most convincing
proofs that the present mode of transpor
tation of freightâ namely, by wagon â Is
deplorably inadequate for the volume of
business to be handled. Three hundred
thousand feet of lumber is to-day and
has been for some time exposed to the
weather in the railroad yards and the
freight sheds are so full that, after wagon
trarllc openÃ. it will take months to get
the merchandise and mining materials to
their destinations, even If every available
team and wagon Is pressed Into service."
The extension of the Sierra Railway up
the mother lode from Jamestown to An
gela Camp is progressing, but Is delayed
by wet weather. The roadbed is graded
to the cut through Table Mountain and
the steel bridge over the Stanislaus at
Robinsons Ferry is being erected.
The oil boom will give Kern County a
short branch road from Bakersfleld to one
of the new nelds :
Oil Is engrossing the attention of an In
creasing number of people In the State.
Stocks in oil companies are being sold in
the northern part of the State and up In
the mountains. The legal tangle war San
Joaquin Valley oil lands promises to ap
proach in extent the past one over Mexi
can land grants.
In Kern County over a hundred drilling
rigs are operating day and night and more
are planned. Land values have risen in
the oil districts. There is a great demand
for experienced drillers and they are be
ing drawn by higher prices from the
southern fields. The demand for drillers'
riffs and well supplies exceeds the sup
ply. At Summerland wells are multiply
ing in the ocean. Last month eighty-four
carloads of oil were shipped.
The Union Oil Company has recently
completed a second tank steamer to run
between Ventura and the refinery on San
San Francisco Bay. Extensive additions
are being made to the storage capacity of
the Southern California fields and miles
of pipe lines are being laid.
The Bakerafleld CalU'ornian reports that
a trial run made by the Santa Fe Railway
Company of oil from Bakersfleld wells gave
satisfactory results and that Master Me
chanic Rutherford has recommended the
use of that oil on all the engines of. the
Valley system. The same paper states that
oil tanks will be built at Point Richmond,
Stockton and Fresno, which, with tho one
at Bakersfleld, will furnish a supply at the
principal points on the line.
When the Onelda, In Amador County,
gets into full operation it will be one of
the great mines of the State, as It was
a generation ago. The finest hoist on the
coast has long been in operation over
the new vertical shaft which London cap
italists have sunk nearly 2000 feet, reach
ing large bodies of valuable ore and, a
sixty-stamp mill Is in process of erection.
The plant and new development will rep
resent an Investment of several hundred
thousand dollars before a ton of ore is
milled. Of its present status the Ama
dor Ledger says:
"The work of mill building at the Onei
da mine has been delayed seriously on
account of the impossibility of hauling
the lumber to be used in its construction
from the depot at lone to the mine. There
is now at the lone depot about 200,000 feet
of lumber for that mill, which cannot
possibly be hauled in a manner that will
be proritable to either the owner or the
teamster for some weeks to come. The
delay already caused by bad roads will
probably place the completion of the mill
as late in the coming year as July. The
development of the mine in the new shaft
and on the levels therefrom continue un
der the efficient management of John
Xruscott, and whenever the sixty-stamp
mill is completed the property will be so
well opened that it can be kept running
indefinitely."
W. C. Ralston, president of the Califor
nia Miners' Association, was In Washing
ton last week on his way home and while
there he did his best with Congressmen
and Interior Department officials to aid
the passage of the mineral lands bill and
other mining measures. One of his efforts
was a delightful and winning dinner at
the Arlington to the California delega
tion, several other Western Senators and
Representatives and Land Commissioner
Hermann.
Stephen Bowers of Governor Gage's
mining bureau has been studying Randa
burg mines and ores,* notes on which will
make part of a forthcoming report on
Southern California mining fields. W. H.
Storms reached Jackson early In the week
and began his studies of mother lode
mines in Amador County. It is expected
that a bulletin by him will be published
In July.
We learn that some fifteen new quartz
mills are to be shipped into Slskiyou
County next spring and summer, or as
soon as the wagon roads are in good con
dition for hauling the heavy machinery
from the railroad depot, says the Yreka
Journal. At present it is hard work to
haul even an empty wagon. This winter
so far is one of the best ever known in
Siskiyou County for successful mlnln B .
There has been a great amount of rain
and snow, though more of the latter would
be very desirable. In connection with this
favorable condition the weather has been
mild, to prevent any freezing of ditches
or stopping the continuous use of giants
in hydraulic mining, with temperature
not lower than 24 at coldest and 50 to 60
most of the time. In the dry diggings
ground-sluicing has been carried on with
great success, and the ground is so well
Â¦soaked thnt the water supply even in the
dry or high gulch and bar diggings will
last longer in the hot season than gen
eral.
The mill at the Arbona mine Is running
night and day on very rich ore, according
to the Tuolumne Independent. After each
round of holes In the ledge the superin
tendent and foreman precede the miners
in order to gather the specimen rock
thrown out by the blast. The work of
stoping from the 500-foot level la in pro
gress. On this property is a case of a
mill being erected before tho true worth
of the mine Is known.
Much activity la now going on around
Tuttletown, Tuolumne County, in the way
of mmmg 1 , and many recent strikes are
reported from there. - ; -.

JOHN C. KIItKPATRICK.

OXE of the very swellest things
that ever happened in local ton
sorial circles was the ball given
last night at Native Sons' Hall
by the Barbers' Protective Union of
San Francisco. Every leading hair
clipper and shaver in the town waa
there with his best girl, and if they
all did not have the greatest time of
their lives they had a mighty close
shave from reaching that realm of the
ideal. In perfect harmony with the
occasion the ladies wore their dresses
cut pompadour, while the gents were
attired In lather-colored shirts and
dress suits.
The affair was in celebration of the
twenty-second anniversary of tHe
union, and no effort was spared to
make It surpass In every detail any
of the organization's previous social
functions. Razors were not allowed

PREPARING FOR DRILLS.
Changes in the Assignments of Offl-
cers at the Presidio.
Drills have been at somewhat of a dis
count at the Presidio during the coming
and going of the volunteers, but now that
affairs have quieted down they will be
taken up again. As a preliminary the of
ficers on special duty are being relieved
and their duties are being distributed
among the post staff.
Orders were Issued yesterday relieving
First Lieutenant Rogers F. Gardner,
Third Artillery, as post treasurer and
signal officer, and assigning the duties of
both positions to First Lieutenant Le Roy
Ettinge, Sixth Cavalry, post adjutant.
Second Lieutenant H. C. Evans, Third
Artillery, was relieved as police officer,
and the duties of police officer will here
after be 'ooked out for by the officer of
the day, who Is also officer of the guard.
The question of clearing the camps will
be settled soon by the report, of Inspector
General Maus, who is now inspecting the
Presidio. He will inspect the camps ami
will probably recommend the condemna
tion of all tents and camp property unfit
for storage. The remainder will be stored.
policemen will not arrest "drunks" after
midnight, as they are compelled to be in
court at 10 o'clock in the morning to give
their testimony.
HORRIBLE DEATH OF AN UNFORTUNATE YOUNG WOMAN.
the engine struck her. At the time its
speed had been greatly slackened, for it
was stopped within twenty feet of the
spot where the woman was hurled be
neath the wheels. She was dragged for
that distance. The entire top of'her head
was crushed, .-pieces of skull and bits of
brain being scattered along the rails. The
wheels passed over her body, severed both
her lower limbs and crushed her right arm
below the elbow. There was still a faint
spark of life when the limp form was
lifted from beneath the engine. The by
standers shuddered as the victim uttered
one or two pitiful groans, which marked
the end of her earthly sufferings.
Miss Lawler was extremely near
sighted and had relied entirely on the
signal bell to apprise her of the approach
of trains at the crossing. Her relatives
state that they did not know that the
BEBKELEY WAS BALKY.
Passengers on the Ferry Boat Had an
Extra Long Trip.
Thanks to the inability of the captain
of the ferry-boat Berkeley to bring the
clumsy bay steamer into its slip on the
7:45 p. m. trip last evening, the passengers
of the Oregon express and the crowded
local trains enjoyed a half-hour's wait
against the piles in front of the ferry
building, while the propeller of this mod
ern craft of the Southern Pacific churned
the waters of the bay In impotent efforts
to effect a landing.
The bell to stop the engines was rung
when the boat was at considerable dis
tance from the head of the pier, a^i'J,
caught by the strong tide the Berkeley
swung round broadside to the piles, drift
ing toward the Mission-street wharf. The
crowds of passengers, congratulating
themselves that a bright moonlight would
afford them some opportunity to save
themselves, watched with considerable in
terest the efforts of the captain to swing
the Berkeley around so she could enter
the slip, by butting the head of the ferry
boat against the piles and then turning
on full steam. After a dozen fruitless ef
forts, in which it seemed that the pro
peller would shake the craft to pieces, the
captain was able to bring his boat Into
the slip and to get the tired and dis
gusted passengers ashore, fully twenty
five minutes late, and after spending
about an hour in crossing the bay.
\/| ISS ROSE LAWLER. a young wo-
II man who resided at 2545 York
I street, and was a relative of ex-
Sheriff McDade. met a frightful
death yesterday morning beneath the
wheels of the San Jose local train at the
crossing of Harrison and Seventeenth
streets. The criininal negligence of the
Southern Pacific Company is directly re
sponsible for the terrible tragedy. The
signal bell at the corner, placed there to
give warning of approaching trains, got
out of order more than two weeks ago
and no effort has been made to repair it.
Trains have passed the place contlnually
since then, but no warning sound has is
sued from the bell.
As the local train from San Jose was
passing down th.? grade toward Seven
teenth street about S:3O o'clock yesterday
morning. Miss I.awler, who was on her
way home from St. Charles Church,
where she had attended early services,
started to cross the track. She waa be
tween the rails before the engineer blew
the customary crossing whistle. She
looked Ui> as the whistle sounded and
was apparently so overcome by fright
that she became completely bewildered.
At first she attempted to retrace her
steps, but changed her mind and started
to run down the track in front of the
engine.
Engineer R. M. Watson, who was in the
cab, saw the danger of the unfortunate
woman, and, shutting off steam, applied
the air brakes with all force. His action
was prompt, but the train was not
brought to a stop until Miss Lawler had
been literally ground to a pulp. She had
run but a few steps along the track when

BADLY BURNED
BY USING OIL
IN A FURNACE
Carelessness Results
in an Accident.
A. Larsen, an employe of the Rlsdon
Iron Works, was the victim of a peculiar
accident yesterday, which came near cost
ing him his life. A3 It was he suffered
severe and painful Injuries, the marks of
which he will always carry with him as
a reminder that in dealing successfully
with fire, caution is an essential factor.
In the furnaces of tne department where
Larsen works oil is frequently used in
making a fire. When this ignitable ma
terial Is employed the common practice is
to open the dampers so as to permit a
free draught and let the darting flames
pass harmlessly up the chimney. It was
a neglect of this precaution that almost
cost the workman his life.
As the match was applied the flames, In
stead of passing up the chimney, shot out
of the furnace door in a solid sheet and
enveloped the careless employe before he
could jump back out of danger. The force
was such that his hat was blown to the
opposite side of the room and his coat and
vest were badly singed.
Larsen was severely burned on the face,
neck and hands and suffered intense pain
on account of a partial inhalation of the
flames. He was treated at the Harbor
Hospital by Dr. Davis, who informed his
patient that he had had a very narrow
escape.

hall were a striking feature of the
affair. Streamers of blue, white and
pink material, bespangled with multi
colored stars, were arranged in grace
ful festoons around the gallery. The
stage was transformed into a dream
of loveliness by the liberal use of cut
flowers and evergreens.
Dancing commenced promptly at 8:30
o'clock and lasted Into the small
hours of the morning, when the floor
became sticky with the pomade that
had melted and dripped from the bar
bers' bangs.
A., L. Hartman was floor manager.
He was ably assisted by I. Abraham
and the floor committee, composed of
the following: F. Abraham, J. Klitsch,
J. Gaxiola. Charles Ivanoff, Charles
Becker and O. Smith. Much of the
success of the ball was due to the
work performed by the committee of
arrangements, which consisted of the
following well-known tonsorialists:
C. It. Zlmmer, F. Kerner, Ad Nitschke,
Valentine Ritschy, A. L. Hartman.
The comfort, of the guests -was at
tended to by an alert reception com
mittee made up of E. P. Roche, L.

W. J. Breckinridge, an engineer, whose
wife lives at 64S Howard street, has mys
teriously disappeared. He left his home at
523 Kearny street, where he and his wife
then lived, last Monday morning, and
since then she has not seen him. She
made inquiries and discovered that he
was seen by a friend either last Wednes
day or Thursday, but all trace of him
has been lost since. His wife reported
the matter at police headquarters yester
day, and said she could give no reason
for his absence from home and she was
afraid something serious had happened
him. He Is 59 years of ago, dark hair and

AM OBJECT LESSON
In a Restaurant
A physician puts the query: Have you
lievfr noticed in any large restaurant at
lunch or dinner time the large number of
hearty, vigorous old men at the tables;
men whose run from CO to SO years;
tr.auy of them bald and all perhaps gray,
but none of them feoble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle Is so common as
to have escaped your observation or com-
ment, but nevertheless It is an object les-
son which means something.
If you will notice whiit these hearty old
fellows are eating you will observe that
they are not munching bran crackers nor
gingerly picking their way through a
menu card of new fangled health foods;
on the contrary they seem to prefer a
juicy roast of beef, a properly turned loin
of mutton, and even the deadly broiled
lobster is not altogether Ignored.
The point of all this Is that a vigorous
old age depends upon good digestion and
plenty of wholesome food and not upon
dieting anA an endeavor to livÂ© upon
bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food cranks
â¢who seem to believe that meat, coffee and
many other good things are rank poisons,
but these cadaverous, sickly looking in-
dividuals are a walking condemnation of
their own theories.
The matter in a nutshell is that If the
stomach secretes the natural digestive
Juices in sufficient quantity any whole-
some food will be promptly digested; if
the stomach does not do s;o. and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal will
remove all difficulty, because they supply
just what every weak atomach lacks,
pepsin, hydrochloric acid, diastase an"d
MX.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and In fact are not
strictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting It
thoroughly and thus gives v much needed
rest and giving an appetite for the next
meal.
Of people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing
them to be perfectly safe to use at any
time, and also having found out by ex-
perience that they are a safeguard
against indigestion in any form, and eat-
ing as they have to, at all hours and ail
kinds of food, the traveling public for
years have pinned their faith to Stuart's
Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for
full sized packages and any druggist from
Maine to California, if his opinion were
asked, Â¦will say that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets Is the most popular and success-
ful remedy for any stomach trouble.

SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
The 3>ay Passed Without Accident or
Special Incident.
The threatening weather kept most of
the people indoor? yesterday, and in con
sequence the park and beach were prac
tically deserted. Those who visited the
beach, however, were repaid for theif
trouble. All day long the breakers rolled
to unusual heights and told the story of
a storm raging far out below the horizon.
No accidents occurred at the park worthy
of mention and not a driver manifested
a desire to ride across to the Farallor.es.
A big crowd gathered at the Chutes and
enjoyed the day in the various sheltered
places of amusement. Emil Markeburg
made a successful balloon ascension.
When the big gas bag was re-leased it
rapidly soared toward the heavens, and
when "about 8000 feet high it was caught
in a breeze and started to drift south. A
thousand feet higher and a returning cur
rent carried the balloon back over the
grounds and Markeberg cut loose his par
achute. The descent was made without
accident in the midst of a crowd of 5000
people.

GRAIN SHEDS ON
SEAWALL HAD A
NARROW ESCAPE
Electric Wire Fires
Section One.
The grain sheds on the seawall narrow
ly escaped destruction by tire early yes
terday morning. Had there been a breeze
at the time the immense Ftructure could
not have been saved, thousands of tons
of grain would have been ruined, all the
valuable cargo discharged from the big
tramp steamer Algoa would have gone up
in the flames and the safety of the ship
herself would have been endangered. As
it is the roof of the building is destroyed
for over 300 feet, over 1000 sacks of grain
are ruined and the wharfinger's office is
gutted.
The building was set on fire by an elec
tric light wire. The sheds are lighted by
means of arc lights and the wire enters
the west end of the shed on section 1, near
the wharfinger's office. About midnight
Watchnran Sullivan discovered a small
fire which had been caused by the elec
tric light wire and put it out. He kept
watch on the spot during his rounds, but
at 5:45 a. m., while he was at the easterly
end of the shed, the flames broke out
again.
When Sullivan discovered the second
fire the names were running along the
shingles almost as fast as a man could
walk. He at'once turned in an alarm to
the State fire tugs, and in a very short
time the Governor Markham was on the
scene and was pouring four streams on
the blaze. The tire brigade was also
quickly in action, and when Assistant
Chief Shaughnessy saw the nature of the
fire he at once turned iti a second alarm.
Even with the reinforcement the firemen
had all they could do to conquer the blaze.
Whenever they would tear off the roof to
get at the fire a blinding cloud of smoke
would drive thenTback. Under the sheds
it was impossible to move about, as the
dense black smoke made it as dark as
midnight. After two hours' hard work,
however, the fire was drowned out and the
danger averted.
Chief AVharfinger Percy Henderson and
Colonel Tom Burgoyne were early on the
scene. They drove in under the sheds to
ascertain the progress that was being
made in subduing the fire and got lost in
the- smoke. When the horse finally found
its way out through the gateway on sec
tion 1 both men were nearly dead from
suffocation. Captain Phil Brown, super
intendent of the State tugs and dredgers,
was also early on the scene and did valu
able service In directing the operations
of the fireboats Markham and Irwin.
It was very fortunate that there was
so little grain on section 1. At the be
ginning of last week the place was piled
high with wheat and barley. Chief Wharf
inger Henderson ordered it all removed,
however, and there were only a few thou
sand sacks left when the fire broke out.
Nearly all the damaged grain belongs to
George "W. McNear, Splivalo & Co. and
Epplnger & Co.
At section 2 of the seawall the big
tramp steamer Algoa is moored. A lot of
her cargo now under the sheds la com
posed or Chinese nut oil, gunnies and
pitch. Had the flames Ignited that, noth
ing could have saved the immense struc
ture.
Broadway -wharf 2 also had a narrow
escape during Sunday morning:. An elec
tric light wire set the building on fire,
but after about fifteen minutes' work the
watchman and one of the crew of the
steamer Pomona succeeded In putting the
blaze out. The Harbor Commissioners
will to-day Inspect the electric light sys
tem on the front.

ONE DAY'S TRAGIC DEATHS AND DISASTERS.

DEATH IN THE
HOLD OF TIE

Stevedore Is Instantly
Killed.
STRUCK BY A FALLING SLING
TWO OTHERS HURT, PROBABLY
FATALLY.
Â«
Heavy Bale of Grain Bags Slips From
Its Heist and Crashes to the
Bottom of the Big
Steamer.
A frightful accident on the steamship
Alpoa, unloading at the seawall, last
evening ended a day of more than usual
disaster. A sling full of goods being
hoisted from the capacious hold of the
ocean monster became loose and nearly
half a ton of freight plunged down
among the isea handling her cargo.
A force of mÂ»>n in the employ of Cap
tain Henry ]ii::cham has been employed
unloading a portion of the immense car
go of the big steamer at the seawall, and
work has l>een kept up day and night.
Shortly after 9 o'clock last night, while
a files load or jute bags was being hoist
ed from the hold, the sling in some man
ner became loose and the hea% - y load of
bags, weighing over 700 pounds, slipped
a.!id went tumbling down the hold of the
vessel.
In its descent the big bale struck three
of the longshoremen who were working
'tween decks, throwing them in a heap.
As soon as possible the comrades of the
unfortunate men hurried to their assist
ance. One of the poor fellows, who was
known only as Johnson and who is sup
posed to have lived on Kearny street,
near' Broadway, was beyond human aid.
as tie heavy load struck him on the head,
evidently crushing his skull and killing
him Instantly. __
Michael Mahoney. who resides at .^2
Harrison street, was found In a helpless
condition close to the dead man. He
could give no idea of how the accident
baspeaed except to say that when the
bale struck hi:n It knocked him down
with such force that he was unable to
jnove.
From his shoulders down his left side
appears to be paralyzed, and it is feared
that he may be injured internally.
The poor fellow, though suffering excru
â¢ ng ; uin. lay In his cot in the hospital
;Â¦.:.â¢; never cmco uttered a muan. His sis
:. rs were notified and they came to the
hospital at once and were assured by their
l-r>.il.* r that he was resting easily, and he
! a.!<- ti'oni to go home, though it could
be -Â¦Â¦â¢!. :!;at nis agony was terrible.
On the cut next to Alahoney was the un
consdous form <<f the third victim, whose
heavy meanings speak poorly of hlÂ»
chance* of recovery. When picked up the
amn was unconscious, and all efforts on
the j>:;rt of the hospital doctors have
Jailed to restore him. The doctors believe
that thf man has sustained Internal in
