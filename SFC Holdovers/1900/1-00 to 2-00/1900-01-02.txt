announcement to-morrow at the quarterly
convocation of the university in Stude
baker Hall. The president hoped to an
nounce that the university would be $4.-
OOOffIOQ richer, but he has not been able to
raise the $:U5.000 which, duplicated by John
D. Rockefeller, would make up that
amount. However. Mr. Rockefeller has
wired that he will extend the limit three
months, and in that time Dr. Harper
thinks he is reasonably sure of getting the
rest of the money, as he has several large,
donations in prospect.
Four years ago Mr. Rockefeller gave thÂ«
university a $1,000,000 present and promised
to duplicate every amount donated before
January 1. 1900. up to J2.000.000. One year
ago Mr. Harper had secured $1,135,000 from
various sources to apply on the $2.00Oj)O0.
Since then this amount has been raised
$550,000.
It Is understood that much of thA money
has come from business men of this city.

REXSBURG. Cape Colony, Jan. i. â -By a brilliant strate
gical movement General French has driven the Boers put of
Colesberg. to which they had fallen back on Saturday from this
place. We had occupied Rcnsburg siding in strength "Saturday
and had come into touch with the enemy, who fired on our
skirmishers from what appeared to be an intrenched position.
We had, however, only one man slightly wounded, but the
proximity of the Boers made every one eager: to advance.
Yesterday afternoon a force of cavalry and infantry with
ten guns, the whole under the command of General French him
self, left here, and after. a detour occupied some hills three miles
from Colesberg, where the Boers lay in strength, confident be
cause of the natural aid afforded them by the hills around. The
enemy's position extended for six miles round the entire vil
lage. At daybreak to-day our artillery opened the battle. The
Boers, though taken a little by surprise, replied with their
guns. The duel went on for two hours without cessation. Our
gunners showed marvelous accuracy and it soon told. The first
enemy's Hotchkiss collapsed and then the Boers' big gun was
silenced early in the action, but the other pieces of artillery held
out until they gradually fell back. The Hotchkiss was aban
doned and we captured it, but the other guns were removed to
the north, as our cavalry closed in. As the guns were withdrawn
they shelled our cavalry, but caused no damage. Our advanc
ing guns speedily silenced them.
The Boers appear to be retreating north, but we are har
assing them and our shells are doing much damage. I can
plainly see horses galloping madly away in all directions after
our shells burst. ' 'Â¦ .â¢ â¢ . .-' â¢ Â¦ '
Colesberg is now in our hands. "The few loyalists who re
main there are jubilant. ., We. have captured many of the en
emy's wagons and a considerable' quantity of stores. Our losses
are quite slight, but the Boers ; must have suffered heavily.
The enemy may. stop at Achtertang or cross the river alto
gether at Â¦Noryais Port, where the bridge is yet intact.
LONDON. Jan. 2.â General French's
success In Cape. Colony ngaln em
phasizes what has been pointed
out. In these dispatches time and
time againâ the absolute necessity
of a strong force nf irregular cavalry and
mounted infantry if the British^are to be
able successfully to cope with the. Boors.
French is one general who has been for
tunate enough to command a force as mo
bile or more mobile than the Boers. Hav
ing this advantage and being a born cav
alry leader, he is the one British general
who has not received a check. He has
beaten the Boers at their own game by
outflanking them continually.
His success, though It may not be a very
important feat of arms, is immensely sig
nificant, as showing what is possible when
the British can move as quickly as the
Boers. This is the first occasion in the
present, war in which the Boers have been
dislodged by a turning movement.
General French is operating In a country
which is fairly favorable to the action of
cavalry, and his force is â¢ mainly com
posed of mounted men. if the other Brit
ish columns had been as well provided
with mounted men we should unquestion
ably have heard less of frontal attacks.
General French has been constantly har
assing the Boers, finding out their strong
positions and then working round on then
flank and ever and anon threatening their
communications. He has advanced, re
tired, maneuvered and fought until by
"successive steps he has driven the Boers
eastward or northward, and Colesberg is
once more in British hands.
General French's successful action is not
the only piece of news from this region.
Further toward the east, near Dordrecht,
which was recently occupied by the Brit
ish, there has been some fighting, with
abundant promise of more. Captain do
Montmorehcy with a reronnoitering party
fell in on Saturday with a largo body of
Boers eight miles north of Dordrecht. For
six hours he managed to keep the Boera
in check, until the arrival of reinforce
ments for the enemy with two guns mado
him retire. The Boers advanced upon
Dordrecht, and when last heard of were
threatening the town. No news has yet
come In whether they made* an attack. on
the -town.
That Qeneral Buller will -once mprÂ© at-
tempt at an early date to force a passage
of the Tugela River seems to be the. fixed
opinion In Frere camp. He has been con
siderably 1 strengthened by the troops of
the. Fifth Division, under Warren, ard
fresh artillery, including several five-inch
and six-inch howitzers from the siege
train. He must now muster not far short
of 30.0T0 men and sixty guns; without
counting; the naval complement. He is
not strong in cavalry, though with the. ir
regulars he should have about 4000 men.
The problem before him is ono of the. most
difficult that war can offer. He has to
cross a river of considerable volume, all
the fords of which are commanded by
earthworks mounting powerful guns and
lined with expert marksmen. The Boers
are superior to him In mobility, and can
follow his movements with such rapidity
that they will probably be able to frus
trate all attempts to turn their positions.
They are not greatly Inferior in number,
having 20.000 or 25,000 men on the Tugela
River. Â¦"?- i
A Free State commando is on the Tu
gela west of Colenso. and guns have been
mounted at Potgleters Drift, evidently to
defeat a turning movement from the
west. Intrenching by both armies at
Modder River still proceeds, but .ouside
of desultory artillery duels and skirmishes
between outposts there is nothing to dis
turb the condition of masterly inactivity.

BULLER'S DIFFICULTIES
HAVE BEEN INCREASED
LONDON. Jan. 2.â The Standard's cor
respondent at Frere Camp, telegraphing
on January 1, says:
"Sir Charles Warren's division Is now
nearly complete. Its headquarters will be
at Estcourt. It Is rumored here that the
guns which- were captured from General
Buller at Colensb have been mounted in
the hills commanding, the drift over the
Tugela River at ; Springfield?.' The-Uoers.

Port Elizabeth, Where British Reinforcements Are Now Landing.
Port Elizabeth lies on Algoa Bay, 428 miles east of Cape Town and 354 miles south of Durban. It is the ocean ter
minus of the Midland Railroad system, which runs to Bloemfontein and Pretoria, and is the nearest port to General
French's base of operations at Naauwpoort. General Cleary's division was destined for this port on sailing from Eng
land, but was later ordered on up to Natal. A larger part of the Fifth and Sixth divisions will probably disembark at
this port.
STARTLING RUMORS
OF A DUTCH RISING
CAPE TOWN. Jan. I.â Ugly rumors are
in circulation of a Dutch rising with the
object of seizing Capo Town and the docks
and capturing the Governor of Cape Col
onyâSir Alfred Mllner. The center of the
movement is said to be Pearl, a village
about thirty miles from Cape Town,
where a meeting of the Afrikanderbund
was held yesterday. A similar meeting
was held at. Richmond on December 2S.
and it la reported that 'the members of the
bund in these two towns are acting In
concert.
The members of the bund in Willlngton
and the Dutch In Clan William District
are said to be armed with Mausers and to
be anxious to use them in behalf of the
Boers.

FRANKFORT. Ky.. Jan. Lâ A war

John H. Whalen. charging him with hav
ing attempted to bribe Senator Harrold.
Senator Goebel, chairman of the Demo
cratic joint caucus. Issued a call for a
caucus to-morrow night. He states that
the caucus is for the sole purpose of nom
inating a candidate for United States Sen
ator. Of course Blackburn will be the
only name presented and he will be nom
inated by acclamation.
The calling of a caucus for Senator at
this early date was a movÂ© on the part
of Goebel leaders to put an end to the
stories, that, in the event that Goebel
should fall In his contest, he might at
tempt to wrest thÂ© Senatt>rshJn from
Blackburn.
erable disappointment has been caused
throughout this province by the failure of
the Dominion Government to include In
the second Canadian regiment for South
Africa n company from British Columbia.
Prominent citizens of Vancouver have de
cided to raise a corps of 100 mounted in
fantry, providing horses and defraying all
expenses.
At a -meeting called by Mayor Garden
It was decided to try to induce the Gov
ernment to accept this corps. Three hun
dred applications have been received from
young men of this city and district. All
are skilled horsemen and good ritle shots,
and many offer to provide their own

TO BREAK THE CORNER

This instruction is due to prGtesy<B"-niade
by prominent cordage manufacturers and
by farmers, calling attention to' the. -fact
That the opening of ports In .Northern
Luzon to-day would afford no relief to the
r.em;. situation and fearnestly requesting
that the southern ports be garrisoned and
Â«P>-nr<i to trade. During the discussion of
the matter I understand there was
brought to the President's attention â¢ a
copy of an instruction given by General
Otis to General Bates, commanding the
military district. Including the Island of
Mindanao and the Sulii group, directing
him to open all ports except those at
which hemp was stored. The explanation
of General Otis" action In this particular
is not fully known here, though it is
gathered from fcis dispatches that in
maintaining the r-mbargo of the hemp
port? he believes Ik- hÂ«s prevented and Is
preventing th* insurgents from obtaining
money with which to continue the insur
rection.
The protests presented to the President
and members 'if his Cabinet assert, on the
other hand, that the "hemp stored (at the
variouh port?) dots not belong to the in
surgents. It belongs to Knglish and
American firms. Money received for pur
chase will go to them and not to the In
surgents."
The Important hemp ports of the Philip

Surigao, Barugo, Taelobam. Baybay, I>>

Malitbog. Cordage manufacturers are
nnxlous that some of these ports shall be
opened. In a letter written by Mr. Meikle-
John. R-?iÂ«=tant Secretary of "War, Mr.
Root stated that if the hemp now

I try by the last of February It will not be

'Â¦Â¦ ington. Secretary Root has directed the
establishment of a government lin*v. of
Â¦ steamers connecting San FranclFeo. Hono
lulu and Manila, similar to that running
between New York and Cuban and Porto
Rlcan ports*. Vessels which will be at
tached to Pacific lines are those trans'
i ports, the property nf the Government
i now in the Pacific ocean. All steamers
! charters! by the quartermaster's depart
ment will be released immediately upon
their arrival at San Francisco, and Blip

j enlisted men and officers ordered home
j will return in these vessel*. It Is stated
by officers ofthe'eaartmnister's depart
ment that the establishment of this line
will be in the direction of an economical
j administration. If thÂ« Government were
j compelled to rely upon private vessels It
would have to pay high freight and pas
page money and vessels would not be- al
ways at its disposal. Very frequently the
naval service deems it in the Interest of
economy to send enlisted men to the
Asiatic station in an auxiliary cruiser, and
In th*e past it has often been found eco
nomical to detach a ship from the far
j eastern squadron and order it home rather
I than to direct men whose terms of enlist

States by passenger steamer.

Because of the rejection by the Senate

I jhat ihey will result successfully. I am
I told that Captain W. Yon Christmas Dir

j Captain Yon Christmas dfd not represent
the Danish Government officially, having
no connection with the Danish legation
here, and while he had no credentials
from the Copenhagen Government, he sat
j lsfied officials that he would be able to ar

"The writer desires to present here the
question of 'the future status and use of
our fleet in the Atlantic. Our ships can
barely cross the ocean without coaling,
not to speak of their return. Some of
them cannut do even this. Under these
circumstances what influence can our

A high administration official said tt> The
Call correspondent: "We must either buy
the island* or brush a&irfe the- MonroÂ«
doctrine and let Denmark dispose of them
to some other nation. To refuse to do.
cither will be pursuing a dog in the
mar.ger policy. Denmark has to pay every
year a deficit in the budget of the islands,
and she is too poor to stand it lrniger. Un
derstanding the situation and appreciat
ing Denmark's desire to sell, the President
has taken the matter under very serious
consideration."
The. proposition to buy the Danish West
Indies will meet with the approval of
naval experts. Secretary Long said to
night that he knew of no recent action on
the part of this Government to acquire
the islands. "I have not asked Captain
Mahan to make any report on the strate
gic value of the islands." he said, "and I
know of none that he has made. I recall
that during the war with Spain there was
some agitation regarding the purchase of
the islands, but there is nothing recent
that I know of."
It is a matter of official record that dur
ing the war with Spain Rear Admiral
Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equip
ment, made a strong recommendation that
the Islands be purchased by the United
States, pointing out the valuable base for
operations against Porto Rico that St.
Thomas- would make. In an article writ

the Korum he makes these statements re
garding the advisability of establishing
coaling stations in the Atlantic Ocean,

/.There have been larger crowds In the
past at the White House New Year gath
erings, but few functions of the sort have
been more brilliant and In none have the
crowds been " better handled, with less
confusion or iess of feminine heartaches
and resentment for dainty toilets dis
arranged .in the crush. Beginning
.promptly at ila. m.. the ceremony waa
concluded at 1:15, at w*ilch time S3si
guests hqd passed down the line.
Mrs. McKinley waa present in spite of
her feeble health. She remained in the
Blue parlor only through the official sec
tion, of the programme, retiring then, aa
had been previously arranged. With the
flush of excitement on her usually pale
face ehe looked bright and happy as 6he,
with the President, led the Cabinet pro
cession down the corridor to the Blue
room. The brilliant lights reflected from
the crystal chandeliers overhead, the
twinkle of tiny electric globes through the
heavy draperies of Bmilax and the Jungle
of palms and foliage plants that walled
the red-carpeted corridor made an excel
lent etage setting for the official proces
sion as.lt moved down the stairs and
through to the Blue parlor, where the
receiving; party waÂ» about to take its
stand. Mis. McKinley bowed and smiled
to the little. crowd of favored spectators
who flliedihe end Of ; the corridor to wit
ness-the opening act of the day's cere
monies. As sEe turned into, the Blue room
she klesed the- -tips of. her white-gloved
fingers to some of the children who waved
their .hands to her : f rorri a point of vantage
near the door;
. The troublesome question of precedence
between the army and navy was settled in

Th& diplomatic corpsj- which headed the.
list of guests, was as always the show featr
ure of the reception.: Lord Pauncefote,
the British EmbaÃsador and dean :of the
corps, led the way. The display of . uni?
forms was brilliant, the Turkish fez, the
gilded orders of Continental â¢ powers,, the
lur-trlmmed tunics and high polished
boots of the Russians, the queers sage
green, gold encrusted uniforms of the Jap
anese and the Â¦ ermine-trimmed silken

A review of the whole winter calendar
up to date could hardly have found a day
br-:tc-r fltte-d for. the New. Year functions. 1
The snow that has grown a trifle grimy
during the past week was covered over
with -a fresh fall, scarcely, ah inch thick;
The broad swwp of the- White House
drive had been quickly cleared of this,
but the lawns w*re covered, with the
fresh, white mantle, and the bare' black
limbs of the trees were outlined In silver,
dust. The sun was bright, but the air
was crisp and frosty. At an early hour
the streets beyond the White House
grounds began to fill with the crowd that
surged back and forth, eager for a place
in the public line that was to follow the
reception of the various eections of the
day's pageant.
The decorations of the Executive Man-
Bicn were not so elaborate as they have
been on some former occasions, still there
was a profusion of palms, ferns, smllax,
holly and other greens everywhere
throughout the state dining-room, the
blue, red and green parlors and the east
room. The mantels were banked high
with foliage plants and the window re
cesses were .filled with tall, graceful palms
and plants. The green of the foliage was
relieved by scarlet poineettia and other
flowering plants. The light of the bril
liant winter day' was excluded, and the
rooms were flooded with electric lights
from thousands of tiny bulbs in the ceil
ings and the sparkling chandeliers add
ing to the brilliancy of the decorations.
The glittering gold- and silver trappings
of the members of the diplomatic corps
and the full-dress uniforms of. the army
and navy contrasted strongly with th*
modest black of the Jurists, statesmen
and civilian officials of the Government aa
they moved, through the mazy throng.
The President and Mrs. McKinley re
ceived in the Blue parlor,. assisted by the
members of the Cabinet and their wives,
and "behind the line" were about fifty of
the wives and daughters of Senators,
Representatives, prominent army and
r.:ivy officers and others high in the social
and official circle*.
The members of the Marine band. In
their red uniforms, were stationed at the
head of the* corridor opposite the state
dining-room, and throughout thÂ« recep
tion played patriotic airs.

NEWPORT NEWS. Va., Jan. Lâ The
stories sent out from Washington Inti
mating that negotiations were on foot
looking to the sale of the shipyard hers
to the Government were wholly without
foundation. :G. 'E.. Miles, the magnate's
private secretary, speaking for Mr. Hunt
ington, to-day denied the report, branding
it as ridiculous. This rumor, Which haa
been started bafore, was doubtless colored
by the visit of a Congressional party, four
members of which are on the Naval Com
mittees of the Senate and House. Some
time ago when it was reported that Mr.
Huntlngton contemplated disposing of his
plant to an English tfrm he said that if ne
ever saw fit "to sell his yard the Lnlttd
States Government ought to be the pur-
It can be stated that there 1Â» nothing
whatever in the rumors. This will bÂ« wel
come news to the local public, as everr
one realizes that should the shipyard pass
into the bands of the Government only
warships would be built here, and the
main support of the city would not be the
important plant that it is to-day, owned
by Collls P. Huntington.
Mr. Huntington declined to talS on
trusts when the subject was broached to
day. This afternoon he addressed tne stu
dent* at Hampton Normal Institute,
where many colored young men and wom
en and a number of Indians arÂ» being
educated- It is expected that the Hunt-
Ington party will remain here until
Wednesday or Thursday. Mrs. Hunting
ton and H. E. Huntington, besides Mr.
Miles, are with the magnate.

found by the United.; States Immigration
Bureau to be. contract' laborers, occurred
here to-day- : " About two weeks ago Im
migration Inspector .Levy brought fifteen
Slavonians here from Mississippi, charged
with having been brought--. here on a
German L.loyd ship in violation of immi
gration laws. To-day he tendered them to
the captain of the steamship Roland of
that line and they were refused. War
rants were Issued for S. G. Spencer, agent
of the company, and for the captain. The
ship sailed without service of the warrant
on the captain, but Spencer was arrested.
Spencer .claimed the men bad not been
tendered to him. and If they were tend

office, the purser, waa obliged to decline
to receive them. â¢ Â¦: ..: ; .. .-:
Inspector Levy says the men were tend
ered to the oompany on December 13 by the
collector of customs and the company ac

for their board.
It is understood that the immigration
bureau has information of some 1500 al
leged contract laborers, which it purposes
Xo deport and that the steamship com
panies intend to resist the orders. Most
of these Immigrants came through Balti

turning contract laborers ls a fine of not
less than $300 in each case, and the clear

WILL STRIKE A BLOW
AT THE TRUST EVIL
Chairman Lockwood Outlines the
Aims of the Conference to Be
Held in Chicago.
CHICAGO, Jan. I.â Members of the ex
ecutive committee of the National Anti-
Trust Conference, to be held in Central
Music Hall on February 12, held a short
conference, to-day at the Sherman House.
M. L. Lockwood of Pennsylvania, chair
man of the committee, afterward issued
a statement in which he said:
Every day the anti-trust sentiment through
out the country ls becoming intensified and
everywhera the cry iÂ» going up: "What can
be done to save the country from the oppres-
sion of the trusts T' The mission of thÂ» con
ference is to answer this cry. To thÂ» political
economists and statesmen of the conference,
rather than to the politicians, will the people
look for utterance which lead to their deliver
ance. Â¦ 'â¢â¢Â¦Â¦â¢â¢ . Â¦'
Â¦ The: ax should be laid to the root of the treÂ«
of special privlleees. The plan is to treat the
causes. Â¦ rather than the effect, to strike at
special ' privileges hardest and first. In gov
ernment ownership, only can railway favoritism
be rrevented. Government control under cor
porate, ownership has proved a failure. In or.
der to destroy the trusts we must take from
them the special advantages which have created
them and they will wither of their own weight
as they meet the energetic competitive capacity
of the. American people. Â¦ ' â¢'.. . :
It Is the plan. to organize all who are op
. posed to. trusts, with the view of uniting the
friends of- freedom in every State, county and
school district, until that concentrated action
Is reached which alone can prove effective.
FAMOUS INDIAN
CHIEF PASSES AWAY
TAGOMA, Jan. I.â The most famous In
dian:', chief of Washington passed away
Saturday night! when "Old" Slgo died at
Port Washington. He was 105 years of
age, having been a contemporary of Chief
Seattle. '. During the Indian wars in. the
'50's he led a large body of Indians againat
the whites and took command aiter
Leschi, his. colleague, was captured and
hanged; He was a large powerful man
and ruled, with an iron hand until the
authority of the Indian agents superseded
his. For several' years, he has been blind
and unable to stand, finally dying of
senility. To his sagacity is largely due
the fact that the Western Washington
Indian reservations comprise the choicest
land; in the- State. Slgo was buried ; to

child. Jumped from a window to one of
the lower floors. He was seriously in
jured and was taken to Believua Hos

rushed into the building: before the arrival
of the firemen. He rescued Lillle Powers,
a child, carrying her through the flre and
smoke. He was burned about the hands
and face and was taken to Bellevue Hos

HIGHBINDERS ARRESTED.
Warring Tongs Decide to Have No
Pitched Battles While Hostil
ities Continue. : ;
Yesterday morning the Chinese squad
arrested three Chinese highbinders^ Louie
Poy, Louie Sing and Tom Sir.g, on Clay
street, and placed them in the tanks at
the City Prison. The Chinamen are sus
pected of having bnen accomplices to the
murder of How Teong last Thursday
night. . .
The information which led to the arrest
of the highbinders was given by an in
terpreter for the Hip Sing Tong. The in
terpreter has bt^en engaged In pointing out
members of the Suey Sing Tong to the
Chinatown srjuad for the past few days
and yesterday morning designated the
three men who kre now In the tanks as
being the parties who followed How Teong
and pointed him out to the nratorious Ng
Ah Foy and his accomplice. Chin Wing.
Affairs assumec! an air of disquietude In
Chinatown last night and thp officers
feared for a repetition of Thursday's
tragedy. Serious trouble Is in the air
but just when it will break out is a matter
of conjecture. An edict was Issued from
the headquarters of the warring tongs
which will prevent any pitched battles in
this city. The line of operation to be
pursued will be to pick off objectionable
Chinamen individually by one or two high
binders selected to do the jobs. In Marys
ville and in Chico, where the present
trouble originated, banils of Chinamen
clashed together and hundreds of shota
were fired In each battle. This information
was given to the police yesterday morning

WET POST HOLIDAY.
Presidio Practically Under Water
While the Men Feast in
Barracks.
If yesterday had no other distinction it
had as least that of being as wet a day
as has ever been experienced at the Pre
sidio. It rained steadily all day, and be
fore night there were pools of water
wherever there was a depression, and the
lower part of the post by the beach had
become a lake.
The day was observed as a holiday by
all the garrison. Several of the officers"
wives received callers during the after
noon, among them being Mrs. Colonel
Freeman, who. was at home to her friends
In and out of the army. In the barracks
the men observed the day in about the
only- way soldiers can, that is, by an
extra dinner and an extra bill of fare.
The holiday turkey was strongly in : evi
dence, and the usual accompaniments
were on the barracks tables in full and
plenty. Â¦ . â¢â¢ '
At the General Hospital there was more
celebration. . The corps men had added
to- their menu arid the patients were also
given extra dishes of a 'distinctly holiday
character. The. tables In thÂ» big dining
room' Were decorated, to suit the occa
sion, and: every, one, both patients and
c'orp* men, enjoyed. 'to the fullest the
opening of the new year. The rain kept
away many visitors to the hospital, but
there .were some who braved the down
pour and .came out' to see and cheer thÂ»
tinfortiinatp' lnhabitants: of the wards. .

J. C. Wilson and Martin Lyman Cap-
tured After a Desperate
Struggle.
J. C. Wilson and Martin Lyman were ar
rested at an early hour yesterday morning
on Twenty-fourth street by Policeman
Thompson after a desperate struggle, and
were booked on a charge of burglary. An
additional charge of carrying a concealed
weapon was registered against Wilson.
Thompson saw the two men standing In
the doorway of Mossford's hardware
store, 2^2C Twenty-fourth street, and asked
them what they were doing there at such
an unseemly hour. They told him to mind
his own business, and Thompson pro
ceeded to do so by placing the handcuffs
over Wilson's wrists.
Lyman showed fight, but a blow from
the policeman's club sent him to sleep.
Wilson attempted to strike the officer with
his .â¢ handcuff r-d hands and during the
struggle a revolver and cartridges were
disclosed stuck in a belt around his waist.
After handcuffing the two men Thomp
son made an investigation and discovered
that they had broken a window In the
hardware store and had stolen several
carving knives and other articles. When
pearched several pieces of strong cord
were found in their pockets and It is sup
posed they were out to hold up belated
pedestrians. â¢ Â¦.Â«.,:.

HUMANE EDUCATION.
THE Zoophile,. a Trio nth ly periodical published In
San Jose: as the official . organ of the Humane
Education Association, has reached the third
number and promises to become one of the most suc
cessful papers of its class in the country. It is con
ducted under the management of a strong board of
directors/ among whom are included David Starr Jor
dan, Dr.Dille,. Hon. Thomas J. Kirk, Mrs. Nellie
Blessing Eyster and Miss -E. M. Gay.
The; Importaiice of humane education i 3 . much
greater than, is; generally supposed. In a' recent ad
dress on the : subject Miss Gay cited some striking
facts showing the results of such education in various
European countries. It appears from these statements
that France long ago discovered that teaching chil
dren kindness to animals not only made them more
kind to animals, but also more kind to each other,
hence it was introduced into the French schools and
the Minister cf Public Instruction ordered publica
tions to be circulated free of cost in order that this
important branch of instruction. might not be neglect
ed. In England generalattention was called to one
public school in London . where in the course of
twenty, years 7000 pupils were carefully trained in
kindness to animals, and during this time, which
would make, some of these boys men of 25 and 35, not
one of them was even arrested for a criminal offense,
proving this teaching to prevent crime as well as cru
elty. Russia, Germany, Norway and almost every
other European nation has Experimented with this in
struction until it ha& become a matter of statistics that
humane education lowers the criminal record. '.
The Zoophile will do. rhuch ,to spread such educa
tion in California and throughout the Pacific Coast,
and it is therefore gratifying to note jt has a bright
prospect of success. Â»If merits a liberal support, for
it is well conducted and is 'interesting and instructive

BEATITUDES AND THINGS.
/T OMMENTING upon the Hoar ; resolutions,
I which set forth what the Senator regards as
:V""^->"tbc "principles upon which our : Government
ought to deal with Cuba and the Philippines; the Bos
con Herald says they are regarded; by: his fellow Sen
ators as moderate, and it adds most of them will sup
port the resolutions provided they have; the liberty
of interpreting them as they understand them.. 'Â¦â¢.
That being, the situation,: it will be interesting to
consider what interpretations can be put upon them.
The Senators are : not talking just now, ;but the jingo
papers are, and xve can learn from their utterances
enough to enable us to form some idea of what is
likely; to be said by the ; imperialists in the Senate
when the resolutions come up for discussion. â¢
The 1 Herald itself does not. think there will be much;
of a debate, and quotes apprbvingly a prediction of
its Washington correspondent that: those parts, of the
resolutions which have any bearing .on thic Philippine:
question ..will be referred to the Committee on ..Phil
ippine Affairs and;will be. "smothered there."'
The Baltimore American says the j resojutibni
"might be called insidious were hot the.tohe and
| purpose rriade clear by a careful reading of the sev
j eral part?." It then goes" on. to s?.y: . "As a new
j declaration of independence it is rather flat." Fur
| thermore it adds: "The Philippine insurrection . is
rot a case for a new declaration of independence^ It
calls for greater activity on the part of the army."
Taken as a whole the commentary of the American
differs from the resolutions inasmuch as the tone and
purpose of it are not made clear by a careful reading
of the parti?, but; its interpretation seems to.be that
Senator Hoar wrote a declaration, of independence
which is not a declaration of independence, and,
moreover, even if it be a declaration of independence
it is flat and untimely. . ;"â¢Â¦. .;
The New York Post says the resolutions '"have, a
somewhat disconcerting air of proposing to enact the
moraj law over again and to give the Beatitudes the
force of a public statute," but it expresses the hope
i that the Senator's speech on the subject 'will' be .more
j explicit. and to t Tie point. So it is evident the Post
did not jrive to the various parts that careful reading
j which, Â¦ according to the American, would have
cleared up the tone of thr whole.
The New York Times says the "resolutions will be
, read with varied emotions, but .the 'general judgment
From the present outlook it appears the Presidential
election this year will hardly be more than a. ratifica
tion of Republican prosperity, and a three, months'
season of marching and hurrahing in celebration. of it!

WELSH CITIZENS
IN NUMBERERS AT
PYTHIAN CASTLE
Festival of Song and
Story.
COMPETITION FOR PRIZES
MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IN SPIBITED CONTEST.
"Blyddyn Newydd Dda 1 chwi." That's
not a typographical error; it's Welsh. It
means, "A happy New Year to you," or
words to that effect, and the air of Pyth
ian Castle was full of It yesterday after
noon and last night on the occasion of
the competitive festival under the aus
pices of the Welsh Sabbath schools of this
city and Oakland. A steady downpour
interfered to some extent with the attend
ance, but not sufficiently to mar any part
of the excellent programme or detract
from the pleasures of the gathering. Both
afternoon and evening tha big hall was
comfortably filled.
The festival was planned as a sort of
literary and . musical accompaniment to
the infant 1900, excellence in either de
partment of culture to be rewarded with
gifts intended to stimulate further energy
on the same lines in preparation for the
festival in 1901, which, tha Rev. J. S.
Thomas took occasion to announce, was
the flrst year of the twentieth century,
the Tope and the German Emperor to the
contrary. Puplisof the various Welsh Sab
bath Bchools on this and the other
Bide of the bay, and their elders, had
been invited to compete In essay, recita
tion and song, in Welsh and English, and
the responses were so numerous that ail
the time from 3 in the afternoon till 10:30
at -night, .'with a brief intermission for
tea, was taken up In the delivery and the
adjudication of prizes. The tea was a
dainty meal served in the hall by the
ladies aim was not the : least attractive
oif the. features of the festival.
During the afternoon festival, at which
Rev. R. R. Lloyd of Oakland presided,
the- efforts of the women and children
were put forward for the prizes. The
children were heard in recitation, while
their elders' riot i only wrote essays on the
life of Either, offered evidences of
their skill with the needle. Edwin Morgan
carried off Â¦ two. : flrst prizes, one for ex
cellence in' reciting Longfellow's . "Psalm
of Life"' and the: other for "The Orphan
Boy." Little Emma Philipps gained the
award for children under eight years for
her rendering of "A Message." Mother
and: daughter carried off first and second
prizes among the women for essays on
the life of Esther. Mrs. Edwards and
Miss Annie Edwards were the lucky ones.
Miss. Flossie DaVis and Mrs. Bowen got
first prizes for their skill In needlework.
David Lewis was. first with a barytone
solo, "The Village BlackÃmith," and
David and Richard Hughes divided flrst
prize for the tenor solo.
Rev. J. S. Thomas of Howard Pres
byterian ; Church presided during the
evening, when the men were straining
their efforts for laurels. There were
many competitors, and the applause until
the close showed- how heartily their ef
forts- Were appreciated. . The Judges, in
spite of the dampness without,, fairly
exuded humor, and their comments on the
performances of the various aspirants for
the bays were decidedly entertaining.
One of the most striking competitions
was that between H. J. Lloyd. T. Philipps
and R. J. Hughes in the recitation in
Welsh. "V Caetwas" (The Slave). Pro
fessor Lloyd, one of the Judges, in mak-.
ing the decision confessed the difficulty he
and his associates had in classing the
candidates. . They had decided, however,
that first honors were evenly divided be
tween Messrs. Lloyd and Philipps, with
R. J. Hughe3 a close second. Mr. Lloyd
had no such close competitor, however,
in his effort, under the norn de plume of
"Student," to capture the first prize for
his essay on character. David Hnghes
was awarded second and Timothy Ed
wards a close third.
David Jones, Henry Griffiths. Pierce
Oven and David Lewis were the con
testants for the. prize .for impromptu
speakinir. The subject was the "Needle."
and most of the gentlemen got stuck al
most Immediately when they handled the
subject. Mr. Lewis was awardM the
prize.
Other prize winners were: Competitive
slnglnjr, first -prize divided between Mrs.
Humphreys and Miss Flossie Davis;
mixed . quartet, Mr. and . Mrs. David
Hughes, Mrs. Humphreys and Ellis
Jones. An . unknown won first priae for
an original poÂ«m on the "Ferryboat."
After the announcement of the last
award. Rev. J. S. Thomas made a short
address in "which he predicted that next
year there' Â¦would be dozens of competi
tors where there was only one this year.
He said it was mental discipline that was
needed; Incidentally he took occasion to
say that he was surprised to read of the
lnslsmlflcant reasons given by Presidents
Wheeler of. Bexkelev and Jordan of Stan
ford for football pfayinj? in the colleges.
He denied that the younsr men played
football for the sake of physical develop
ment, and .'averred that it was played
solely and merely for the sake of the
pame. The festival closed with the slnp-
Inp of the Welsh national hymn. "Land
of My Fathers."

NOW. FOR OAKLAND.
THE success of the panhandle proposition in
this city has stimulated public spirit in Oak
land. The victory of the Ebeil ladies in raising
the means to buy and present to the city a site for
the public library has had its effect upon that city
favorable to a larger eri'ort for public enterprise.
Looking upon Oakland in the light of its natu-al
advantages it would seem that the people of that city
owe to themselves the duty of immediate acquisition
and progressive improvement of a park system. A

A PROPOSED FRUIT-GROWERS' UNION
AT the recent convention in San Jose of the fruit
growers of the State one of the subjects dis
. cussed with most interest was that of forming
some sort of an association by. means of which the
growers could market their crops to better advantage
than at present- It was determined to call a larger
gathering of the fruit growers of the State for the
purpose of devising means toward accomplishing the
object, and a committee was appointed to make the
necessary arrangements and issue the call. The com
mittee has acted and a convention has been called to
meet in San Jose on the 15th of this month, at which
time plans for the desired association will be submit
ted for consideration.
In the call for the convention It Is 6tated that the
trend of thought at present is toward. an association
with a membership without capital stock, under the
co-operative law. of 1855. It has been . further sug
gested by the president of the Raisin Growers' Asso
ciation that the deciduous fruit men should form two
associations, one of the producers of prunes and dried
truits and the other of green fruit growers. These
suggestions, of course, will be subjected to the con
sideration of the convention and possibly may be set
aside for -other plans that will appear more satisfac
tory to the majority.
Upon the expediency of the main issue of forming
an association sufficiently strong to assure the grow
ers a fair price for their crops there is seemingly no
difference of opinion. The success which has attend
ed the Raisin Growers' Association, while not all that
is desired, is still sufficient to encourage the orchard
men to follow the example of the vineyardists.
The circumstances of the time are propitious to the
undertaking and some form of association ought
not to be long delayed. In his address at the recent
convention upon what has been achieved for the rai
sin growers by co-operation President Kearney, after
pointing out the success of Jthe movement, said:
''This year the crop is estimated at 2700 carloads of
ten tons each, and with organization we have raised
the price of unpacked raisins from last year's figure
of 3 cents to within a fraction of 5 cents a pound, or
in two years from I cent to nearly 5 cents. At this
price there have already been shipped out and paid
for 2200 carloads; 150 cars of the remainder are sold
on time orders and the remaining 350 cars are under
contract of sale and will be paid for by January 15
next, thus closing up the growers' business on a cash
basis within four months from the beginning of har
vest, and for the first time.in the history of the indus
try; Mainly as a result of this success the savings
banks report that the growers are rapidly paying off
their mortgages; traveling men say that Fresno, the
center of the raisin district,. is. one of the most active
business places in the State, and real estate agents say
that "the value of Fresno town property has increased
50 per cent within two years, with free sales, and that
vineyards! which two years ago could not be sold for
$100 to $150 per acre now find willing purchasers at
$250 to $375. per acre,'!-." . . ; Â¦ Â¦"Â¦'.
There is no apparent reason. why 4ruit growers may
nbt achieve as much for themselves as has been done
by the raisin men. The coming convention, there-.'
fore, ought to be largely attended and animated by a
sanguine spirit of : hopeful and helpful co-operation.
It vvotild.be of vast advantage indeed if the work of
uniting and organizing could be carried on with suffi
cient vigor to form an association . in time to handle
and market the: crop of the coming season.
Several times during : the Christmas holidays the
Boers have : been dropping shells stuffed with plum
pudding into beleaguered Ladysmith. Next thing we
kuow they will be dropping oysters on the half-shell.

FUTILE BRYANISM.
IT is announced by a member of the Bryan national
committee that during a recent tour in the. South
he found a general sentiment in favor of dropping
free silver in the next national convention and rais
ing other issues. He reported the party to be weary
of thrumming on the same old single string and de
sirous of more varied music. This feeling was dis
closed in the Gulf States and up the Atlantic Coast,
even to North Carolina. As to the candidate, how
ever, he reported the feeling universal that it must be
Bryan. The plan illustrates the futility of the present
plans of the party management. The large indepen
dent and thinking Democratic vote of the country is
left out of the new calculation, and there seems to be
no appreciation of the fact that the voters are divided
into several classes. There are thos,e who follow the
party any way and look to its politicians for reward.
Others look more to political principles than to mere
expedient declarations made by the party. Still others
are moved by consideration of principle and weigh
carefully the character of party leadership. The two
latter classes control elections in this country. .They
are the voters who elected Mr. Cleveland and who
turned and elected President McKinley, and will elect
him again regardless of what platform declarations
may be made by Mr. Bryan's party.
They will do this because of the profound distrust
of the leadership of Mr. Bryan's party. Even this
last proposition proves those leaders to be either
without convictions or to lack the courage to carry
them out. There Is a total lack of what is called char
acter in the Bryan leadership. The politicians who
have charge of Mr. Bryan's party, go up and down
the country jauntily remarking that white is black,
prophesying and predicting, jumping from issue to
issue, out of the frying, pan mt o the fire and back
again, and telling the public that frying pan and fire
are both cold when they are both hot. The great
dividing line of principle between the two parties is
lost sight of by these men. They fail to understand
that the views held by men on either side of that line
meet always at one point, are focused upon one place
and are patriotically intended to accomplish the same
purpose, though by widely different methods. From
the beginning of our party divisions these two schools
of political principles have for the most part sought
the welfare, happiness and prosperity of all the people,
and the issue between them has been upon methods,
not upon the result desired.
The Bryan cult has taught a blind and deaf opposi
tion to everything that is. It began in a platform
attack on the constitution itself. It threatened to
break down judicial protection to life and property.
It menaced the civil service and declared its purpose
to return to that sum of all diseases in government,
the Epoils system in the public service. It shook a
portentous fist at every interest, grudged the success
of the prosperous and called the unthrifty to prey
upon the thrifty. The leaders who made 6uch a fight
and lost it, and have kept on and lost in every elec
tion since, until their party has not a Governor nor
a Senator in the North, are men who do not enjoy
the confidence of the best men in their own party, and
whose ways and purposes are scoffed at and repudi
ated by the independent and thoughtful voter.
Mr. Bryan never had any but a spectacular value
in politics. He paid himself out for all this value
that Aas in him in 1896, and got value received, in
defeat. He put nothing on the political market and
got nothing in return. But he personally enjoyed it
as a boy enjoys playing circus, and being so self
sufneient that he cannot be flattered, has kept him
self before the public, and has only impressed i few
of his part}' to take him at his own estimate of him
self. His oratorical displays are gilded platitudes.
They rank with those articles of household ornamen
tation which are constructed by gilding flour barrels
and pasting lithographs on them, or illuminating soap
boxes and wheelbarrows, "to make home beautiful."
The commonplace among phrases are uttered by
him, with uplifted hand and eye, in tremolo, but. after
all, they are commonplace and non-impressive to any
thinker.
He will no doubt again lead his party through an
eruption of the parts of speech, armed with mullein
stalks, to worse defeat than before, and will then take
his place in the limbo of the forgotten, a speaker who
never gave plain utterance to any great principle, a
leader who never won a victory, a prophet as uncer
tain as a nickel-in-theTslot: machine, and a politician
who was merely a curiosity by reason of;his eyes be
ing set in the back of his head. : - ; ] .''Â¦Â¦'

with "mixing his political philosophy with socialistic
mush," and wishes to know why the Senator deems it
necessary to "put all this flimsy wrapping around the
anti-imperialistic kernel .of his resolutions."
The Commercial Advertiser says: "The general
principles of the omnibus resolution cover as much
ground as the Decalogue and are no more to be dis
puted than the multiplication table." It adds, how
ever, that if it were needful for the American people
to put forth a new declaration of principles no Con
gress would be empowered to do it without a special
mandate,, From that argument it draws the conclu
sion if there be any new principle of government in

Bo little has the Frenchman In common
with Great Britain ln the matter of art
it seems strange that an Englishman was
more or less responsible for the' great
change that came over the French land
scape work early In this century -and made
possible the "Barbizon painters," as Is
called the great school of landscape men
who started Into life about the year IS3O
and which completely revolutionized the
manner of work and of looking at nature
then prevalent in France; but It is safe to
say that had It not been for John Con
stable we should have waited some time
for such men as Rousseau, Corot. Dau
bigny, Dupre and the coterie of brilliant
Frenchmen who to-day are so popular and
who are referred to as the "men of
thirty."
John Constable, who was born June 11.
1778, ln East Bergholt, Suffolk County,
England, was the son of a well-to-do
miller, a man with plenty of Intelligence
and common sense, but with little notion
of the fine arts. He had hoped to have
his son enter the church; falling ln that
he desired him to succeed him ln the man
agement of the mill, and so conscientious
was -his child that for a year he tried to
content himself at the trade of the father.
It was not to be, however, for the boy
spent more time watching the heavens
and studying cloud forms than he did ln
looking after the business; though his
knowledge of wind and storm, of weather
possibilities and the like served him in a
way, it was all rather with a view of put
ting his observations down on canvas than
of utilizing them for the turning of the
great sails to produce power for the grind
ing of grain. After awhile he received a
half-hearted permission to follow hla
artistic Inclinations and he filled many
sketch books. Through the assistance of
some friends who were Interested ln him
he secured some paintings to copy, for in
those days most of the students spent
considerable time in making careful tran-

Ing also the figure, he made a. number of
portraits, but his work In this direction
was not destined to. make him famous and
that which remains is only of the moat
mediocre character, not for a moment
comparable with his landscapes. It was,
however, the only sort of work that paid
him anything and his people urged him
to continue. .. ","" : . â¢ " â¢
Overcoming all. home obstacles, how
ever, he finally went to London just at
the close of the last century, when he was
23 years of age, and he began a serious
course of study in the life classes at the
Royal Academy, of which' the American.
Benjamin West, was president. Con
stable continued meanwhile at his land
scape work, and from the first saw na
ture in a larger, grander- way t*ian the
men about him. He had no patience with
the prevailing manner of. painting, for
most of the men were working ln a
nlggly, highly finished manner, giving
little impression of nature and securing
almost none of her great truths. Theirs
was the manner of Claude and Poussln,
securing all of the faults of these masters
with few of their virtues, and tha pic
tures were composed on conventional
lines, worked out as it were by.' recipe,
according to certain laws. Toe : public
liked this, or at least had been so accus
tomed to It that it resented any de
partures, but It is needless to say that
great art is pot so evolved.
Early in his career Constable bad had
his pictures rejected by the hanging com
mittee of the Royal Academy. He felt
the Injustice bitterly and on one occasion
he took a despised canvas "to '-the presi
dent of the institution; asking him frank-"
\y If he could tell the reason of the re
fueal and to give him. advice as to- what
to. do. West received 'hlih, cordially and
examined the Work carefully; at length he
said: "Don't be discourak.ed, young man;
we shall hear of you again;, you must
have loved nature very much you
could have painted this.". Constable, was
much encouraged by this,' naturally, but
for many years, although, he had: better
luck with the hanging committees, ...his

for : and with justice; they.- thought such
â¢a match at that time quite imprudent.. It
was the occasion of many a heartburn^
and Constable's mother was most inter
ested in herison'B love affairs. Many let

formal, dignified epistles, written ln state-
Jv language; as was the/, manner then.
.They seem, >lt must be confessed as we
look at things to-day, hopelessly stiff and

writer. These continued.- however, many
years, and finally love triumphed, for the
pair eloped. : AH was soon forgiven, even
the rich unfcje relentlng".*nd leaving them
at his death a substantial sum.
Constable presently lost his father snd
mother, and receiving- " from the estate
an ample sum of money,, which put him
work, howeverâ that Is, a certain portion
of the public, for there were many discus
sions regarding the remarkable departure 1
in the landscapes of this daring English
man. The contentions had little effect oa
him, however, and he continued on his
way, undisturbed either by praise or
blame. He was prolific and was constant
ly at work, making studies out of doors,
for he had discovered how much the
beauty of the landscape depended on light.
While the other men of hi 3 time were.
working in their studios almost entirely
and getting pictures in low keys, far away
from the real thing ln the open air. ha
secured the scintillation of atmosphere,
the light and shade of nature, with the re
sult that his pictures fairly shone. Hla
greens were not the dirty, opaque tones
that were then the fashion; they had tha
sparkle of summer, the light of dew and
the reflection of the sky. All this seems
obvious and easy now; but then it was a
different matter, and it took the public a
long while to accept it. Constable i-alcl

details of nature- He believed in giving
the big aspects of the picture. Sometime!
a trifle brutal, there was nevertheless al

gathered around their standards, - kneeling.be-.
lore the Lord, of Hosts': and, verily,. X any one
haa especial reason: this day for bowing 'down
before God it : is :oilr ; army. A glance at pur
standards *uf flees .as' an explanation, for. they
ara the embodiment ot our. history.
In -what- condition did the past century at. Us
dawn find- our army? Â¦ The glorious army :of
Frederick th* Great had slept upoh Its laurels,
fossilized amid all the petty detail of plpn clay;
led by superannuated and insufficient generalp,
with officers unaccustomed to useful work, and
lost la debauch, luxury and foolish arrogance.
Our army. In a word, was not e<iual to its
mission, which, indeed. It had forgotten. Heavy
was the chastisement of heaven which over
took It and -fell on our peoplft. . It was cast
Into the dust, the Klory of Frederick VfM ex
tinguished and our standards were broken. In
many lorur years of servitude God taueht our
people to look to themselves, and. under the
pressure of the foot of the proud conqueror,
our people engendered in itself the most sublime
thought that It is the highest honnf to dedi
cate one's blood and purse to the Fatherland
In her army service. Form and life were given
It by my great grandfather; new laurels
crowned the newly created army and its youth
ful banners, but universal military service only
attained Its true significance through our great
departed Bmperor. In his quiet work he evolved
the reorganization of our army in spite of op
position and lsnorance.
Glorious campaigns crowned his work in a
way never expected. His spirit filled the ranks
of our army, even as his own trust In God
bore our troops to astonishing victories. With
this, his own creation, he brought the German
races together and gayÂ« us back long-desired
German unity. It is to him that cur thanks
we due. and. by the help of that army, the
German empire-, commanding respect, haa again
assumed the position assigned to It in the
council of nations. "Â¦'Â¦' y; Â¦'Â¦:Â¦Â¦
It Is for you, gentlemen, to preserve and em
ploy in the new century the old qualities by
which our forefathers made the army creat.
namely, simplicity and modesty In daily life,
unconditional devotion to the royal service, the
employment of one's whole strength of body
and mind in the ceaseless work of training and
developing our troops, and, even as my grand
father labored for his army, bo will I, In like
manner, unerringly carry on and carry through
the work of reorganizing my navy in order that
It may \>Â«- Justified in standing by the side of
my land force*, and that by It thÂ» German
empire may also be in a position to win the
place which It haÂ« not yet attained. With the
two united I hope to be enabled, with a firm
trunt in the guidance of God, to prove the
truth of the saying of Frederick William I:
."When one in this world wants to decide
Bomethlng with the pen he does not do It un
less supported by the strength of the sword."
Emperor William has issued an order
to the army announcing that, In accord
ance with the unanimous decision of the
German sovereigns, a badge coramemo,
rative of the last century and as a fresh
pledge to the unity and indissolubility of
the empire, has been established for the
colors of the whole army. . : . " .
REORGANIZATION
OF CUBAN FORCES
Commands to Be Greatly
Â¦..Â¦';Â¦ "Reduced.
Special . Plspatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. Lâ lt is probable
that the month will be marked by a com
plete reorganization of the military com
mands In Cuba*. The Impression prevails
that there, is to be a heavy reduction in
the. forces/ and it is intimated that the
outcome will be the creation of two de
partments. Instead of the six which orig
inally comprised Cuba, and. the four into
which, the island ig now divided. General
Wilson, who commands the combined de
partments of MatanZas and Santa Clara,
has been ordered to Washington, and it Is
not the present intention .that he shall re
turn to Cuba. It Is said that while here
he-,-, with General Davis, who Is coming
from Porto Rico and is due on the 6th at
New York, will confer with the commit
tees of Congress having to do with the
creation of a new form of government lor
Porto Rico and with legislation for Cuba
during the time It shall remain under
American control.
The combined department of Santiago
and Puerto Principe is without a com
mander, although the duties of the post,
vacated by General Wood upon his pro
motion to the Governor Generalship, ere
being temporarily discharged by the se
nior colonel. Thus the entire Orient, as
the eastern half of the Island is called,
is without a permanent commander. It
is understood that the four departments
in the Orient will be consolidated into one
and that a brigadier general will be
named by Secretary Root, upon the rec
ommendation of General Wood, to take
command, with headquarters at Santiago.

shot this morning In three separate places

the men resumed their quarrel. Finally
Burris started to -drive away. Hughe3
drew a revolver and began firing. Imme

up to City Marshal Rueck and was taken
to Kings County Jail.
A singular fact In connection with the
affair is that Hughes had been drawn on

THE SA:N t FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 2, 1900.
MURDER OF
MINING MAN
A Mountain Grave Re
veals Horrible Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BISBEE, Arizona, Jan. Lâ Evidence has
been discovered leading to the conclusion
that E. W, Derry, a mining man who long
had been missing, was deliberately mur
dered. L. C Brown, the dead miner's for
mer partner, is in Jail at Tucson charged
with the crime. Derry's body was discov
ered in a shallow grave In a canyon In
the Sierra- Jeriquipe mountains of Sonora,
Mexico. The corpse was clad only In un
dergarments and in the skull were two
indentations :as though made by the blow
of: a pickax. Circumstantial evidence
points strongly toward Brown as the
perpetrator of the crime.
Last September when. Derry disappeared
Brown stated that ho had bought his
partner out and that Derry had left for
other parts. Within ten days Brown dis
posed of the entire outfit of prospecting
equipment and took his departure. Be
coming suspicious a party of men made
a thorough investigation of the ground on
Christmas- day where the â¢ partners had
pitched their tent. The search resulted In
the finding of the body of Derry.
After Brown left the Mexican side he
ne*t made his appearance in Blsbee, Ari
zona, with plenty of money. From Bis
bee he went to Tucson, wher6 be posed as
F/erry and. was successful in securing
iIOOO from: the Bank of California, which
sum, had been deposited there by Derry.
An acquaintance who knew Brown by his
right namÂ£' became suspicious and com
municated his fears to the police that
something was wrong. Investigation of
Brown's apartments revealed a lot of pa
per upon which he had practiced writing
the name of E. :W.- Derry, a significant
point that forgery of the name was in
tended. Â¦ He was arrested and is now in
jail at Tucson' awaiting trial. '...'Â¦*

DEFEATED BY
MULTNOMAH
Oregon Eleven Wins Very-
Fast Game by Score
of I V to 6.
PORTLAND, Jan. I.â The football team
of the Multnomah Athletic Club of Port
land this afternoon, defeated Stanford'
University by a score of 11 to 6, in one of
the fastest football games ever played on
Multnomah field. All morning a drizzling
rain fell and puddles of water stood on
the field, but just before the game was
cabled the sun came out and the day.
turned out to be an ideal one for football.
Nearly sow people witnessed the game,
and during the lirst half the enthusiasm
knew no bounds, so fast was the playing.
Although the university team averaged
up seven pounds more than the Mult
nomahs, the athletic club's team found
no difficulty in going through center and
McMillan, Multnomah's big right half,
was forced through again and again for
thrte and five yard gains.
Murphy kicked off for Stanford and
Kerrigan, Multnomah's fast quarterback,
caught the ball, lie skooted around left
end for a gain of twenty yards. Mult
nomah then etarted In to buck Stanford's
line, and inside of nine minutes they had
guinea eighty yurds and scored a touch
down without losing the bail. Multnomah
then kicked a goal.
In the second kick-off Kerrigan again
caught the ball and made a gain of seven
yarcis. Davey, ilultnomah's fullback,
punted and Stanford got the bull for the
Ursa time. Fisher carried It around left
end for again of ten yards and Murphy
immediately thereafter made a gain of
seven yards around right end. When the
ball was put in play again the Stanford
team massed on the right end and Fisher
broke through Multnomah's guard and
made a touchdown. Stanford kicked a.
goal which made the score 6 to 6.
McMillan kicked off for Multnomah a.nd
Murphy made .a. beautiful . run, gaining
fifteen yards before he was tackled by.
McMillan. Murphy punted and . Mult:-:
notnah pot tnt-ball and worked. It down
to Stanford's flve-yard line, .when they;
lost it on a fumble. llurphy : punted from
behind the goal line, but the play .was 1
blocked by Fi&her, and .Rusk, Multno-;:
niah's right tackle, fell on. the ball behind
the line. The referee awarded ; .a touch
down to Multnomah, and time vr&s. called
for the first half .without Multnomah
kicking a froal. . . ..-.â¢.â¢ -V Â¦:.

Four r ; Winning ; Choices ;' at
Tariforanâ^Potente Won
New Year's Handicap. .
.It was' real -VTa.nfo.ran-' weather" yes
terday down at the Western Turf Asso
ciation's track in San Mateo County/ The
rain fell in torrents, drenching the jock
eys to the skin, and causing the holiday
crowd to huddle together in the betting
ring and under the protecting roof of the
grand stand like Indians at a great medi
cine powwow. : Four favorites splashed
In lirst, while Potente and Cyril aroused
some show of enthusiasm by winning at'
quite remunerative odds..- Fifteen book
makers cut in, and as their prices savored
strongly of syndicate uuotations must
have laid aside some coin.
The New Year's handicap, at one mile
and a sixteenth, was all shot to pieces.
When owners had done with the scratch
ing blank, but five remained, and it
strongly resembled a Brltfsh redoubt after
having been shelled by the Boers. Car
roll's handy mare, Daisy. F, was plunged
on at odds of even money and nnlsned
absolutely last. Potente, an 8 to 1 shot,
with Tod Walsh in the saddle, went to the
front and simply galloped in the easiest
sort of a winner . from Imperious. Top
mast lout the show to Morinel by a neck.
Oorrigan's Geyser met with more suc
cess In the six furlong handicap. Ruling
a 6 to 5 choice, he' picked up 119 pounds
and was never extended.. Four lengths
back at the wire Ben Ledi took the place
from Frank Bell by a length.
The opening live furlong Â¦ scramble
proved an. easy thing for the 4 to. 5 favor
ite, Loving Cup, which. won all the way.
After running in second place almost to
the wire Nora Ives was collared and
beaten out for the place by Juva, a 12 to 1
shct. well ridden by Henry. Â¦ Â¦ â¢..
Old Meadowthorpe came out chipper and
spry as a two-year-old, placing the purse
for' the mile and a .furlong selling -event
to the credit of.-.the Schorr stable without
half trying. Jones had theileg up and .Mid
his mount- In front from the start/winning

The reserve stake was won by R. E. de

was won there were, long lines of men be
hind each pool box with, tickets to cash
on Minnie Wa Wa, Forest Queen led
from the slips by a number of lengths
and it seemed she must w'.n handily. She
scored five points and then the Lopez
representative was placed. The hare
proved a strong one and she scored five
points. Forest Queen scored again and
then Minnie Wa Wa killed, scoring the
two points necessary to win, the score be
ing seven to six. â¢ .

Rev. Pet*r C. Yorke. pastor of St.
Peter's, preached the sermon, and in part
he paid:
"Th*" priest represents not himself alone,
but the person of Christ. He stands as
the medium between God and man. This
is the foundation for the respect and hon
or that Is gi\>?n to the priest, and that ie
why his people call him by that most ten
der name. 'Father.' It is well to think of
thepe things on an occasion like this,
when we are colled together to listen to
the firet mas^ from one who went out
from this parish as a student and now re
turns to you as n priest."
Rev. Father O'Malley said mass at St.
Patrick's. The edifice was also crowded,

pleasure .thtit Mrs. A. A. Moore had in in
troducing; tTiie, wife of her eldest 6on was
equaled by.; that of society In meeting: her.
:> The .reception: was'held at the handsome
house of the.' Moores, Sixth avenue and
East Twentieth, street, and proved a suc
cess, for the .steady downpour did not
greatly 'deter visitors - from calling, and
;tbose: :who.. called found that the gloomy'
skies -without only made the scene within
a more brilliant one by contrast. The re
ception might be said to have therefore
two very pleasant purposes to the large
circle of acquaintances of the Moore fam
ily. It was ttie welcome means of ex
changing New .: Year's greetings with the
host and hostess and their charming
daughters. And more Important still, it

. Mrs. Hall .'was one of the most promi

Society; Â«. As a member of the two former
organizations she was most intimately
connected with the arrangements for' the
day at the -"at home" of Mrs, F. M.
Smith. She was one of those who was to
dance the minuet in the colonial costume.
She was one of those who was to assist
Mrs. Smith in receiving for the day and
was a part of the dinner party and the
evening reception party at Arbor Villa.
She was also a member of St.. Paul's
Church. wa& greatly interested ' in its
enoir, and.haa arranged to entertain the
singers at ; . her home immediately at the
close of tho midnight services last even
ing. ...
All of these events had been too much
of a tax upon her strength and she col
lapsed on her way to the church.
Death came before, the dawn, ami when
Mrs. F. M. Smith received the sad news
sac at once canceled all of her engage
ments for the day, postponed her elabor
ately prepared receptions and did every
thing in her power to show her keen re
gret at the death of her friend and asso
ciate. The pretty dance with the wonder
ful costumes that had been prepared, the
elaborate dinner, the evening reception,
all were postponed, and Mr. and Mrs.
Smith received but very few friends and
those in the most Informal manner. And
so death laid its.heaw hand alike upon
a happy family and the pulse of Oakland
society, at the same time. .:

HEW YEAR OPENS
WITH "FINNIGAN'S
BALL," A FARCE
Fougere Is. Packing
the Orpheum.
"THE CHRISTIAN" STILL ON
"CHDIMIE FADDEN" AT THE
AIiCAZAIU
The Christmas Spectacles "Sinbad"
' and "80-Peep" at the Grand
and Tivoli â Usual Vari
ety at tho Chutes.
"Flnnlgan'a Ball" is not a' comedy nor
a farce nor a farce-comedy, but it amuses,
which Is the main thing. A sense of
humor Is not lacking In Messrs. Murray
and Mack, the vaudeville graduates who
are' most of the show, and It crops out
occasionally In spite of thelF efforts .to
disguise it in horseplay of the most mons
trous kind. I could not help thinking
after every turn and encore that the.per
formers would give way to a horizontal
bar act, a ventriloquist or a band of
trained cats, so much does the show
t mack of variety. But. no, it went on and
on and on, a veritable continuous per
formance, and Murray and Mack were In
It all the time.
They are a versatile pair at all events,
combining singing and dancing, acroba
tics, knock about stunts and just plain
dialogue that }s Intended .to be funny and
does not always miss the mark. I did
not find the temptation to laugh at their
antics very strong, but the audience
seemed to think differently, which is more
important to the management. There is
one irresistibly ludicrous shot in the first
act when the two stars of comedy give a
burlesque boxing match. It is an old, old
turn, but Mr. Slurray and Mr. Mack suc
ceed in making it decidedly comic. There
is another laughable moment in act 11,
when a certain Charles Barry imperson
ates John Phillip Sousa and indulges, in
some paroxysms over the bass drum.
Barry's work throughout as the tramp Is
not bad as such things go. A feature
that succeeds to the extent of a- half
doien encores is the male quintet, which
purveys a popular kind of music. For
mine own part, however. I know of noth
ing more irritating than those uncouth
songs and minor harmonics that always
have taken and I- suppose always will
take the crowd. â¢Â¦*Â¦:-'
There is an animated doll In the cast
whose name is Kittle Beck. She can open
and close her eyes and say papa and
mama. She is more prominent than -any
cf the other girls, who are very .sugges
tive of the Standard's hosiery pictures
and sports as many costumes as she gets
dollars a weekâ perhaps. Â¦ Â¦
PORTER GARNETT
Orpheum.
ThÂ» Orpheum "management has com
menced the new. year with a surpassingly
attractive programme, and- a -more thor
oughly satisfied audience never gathered
within its walls. There are more than ono
turn that of itself would prove a sufficient
attraction for one evening, and first
amjng them is Dorothy Drew, the singing
comedienne. She has already completely
captivated the patrons of thi3 popular ro
eort. not alone ry her sweet. 53-mpatnetlc
voice, but by her charming personality.
She is possessed of an exquisite form and
a quiet, refined manner that is refreshing.
Her singing of "Arrah, go on" was a
gem. but It was surpassed by "I'd leave
my happy home for you," which literally
"brought down the house," particularly
when she knelt in front of the leader of
the orchestra and whispered, "Are you
nervous?" Her cake-walking is Immense,
and for high kicking she can rival La
Sylphe. - > ;. -
Billy Rice and H. W. Frlllman, the old
time- minstrels, appeared in a skit, "A De
serted Mansion," and created no end of
laughter. They will make a decided hit
on the vaudeville stage. Frillman's deep
bass voice was given full scope in an in
troductory song. Billy's age haa not
dimmed his sense of the grotesque, aud
the way he rolls his eyes is something
worth going to see. Douglass and Ford,
einglng and terpsichorean artists, and Joe
and Wally Rozino are European novelty
eccentriques. The other newcomers made
a favorable impression. Of the hold-overs
Fougere, the Parisian chanteuse. seemed
to be In particularly good form last night
and was loudly applauded. John J. Thome
and Grace Carleton In their comedy "The
Substitute." the Avervs, La Sylphe and
the American blograph complete the at
tractive bill. '
TivolL ;Â¦;Â¦:Â¦,
"Little 80-Peep." at the Tlvoll, was a
success last evening. . The special and
particular success was the butterfly scene,
at the end of the last act, which was one
mass of glittering effects with flowers of
such sheen and brilliancy as are never
seen off the stage and never on the stage,
outside of the spectacular drama. There
were changing lights and young women
who developed wings unexpectedly, one
of whom went soaring away toward the
ceiling. This was the triumph of Oscar
L. Fest and the scene was so good that
the audience complimented it by remain-
Ing to the end; although the hour was
late. Musically, "Little 80-Peep". is not
so pleasing, although there were "several
good numbers and one song,- sung. by Wllir
lam. Schuster, was very catchy. . There
are a lot of lecal gags and horseplay and
also enough assorted fun to make the
evening pass very pleasantly. The prin
ciji.il fun makers were Ferris -Hartman,
\\ lUlam Schuster. Phil Branson and Caro
line Knowles. Annie Meyers .was Little
Boy Blue and Anna Lichter, Little Eso-
Peep. The house was .large, notwlthv
standing the weather. - . Â¦.â¢/.:Â¦.
Grand Opera-House.
"Binbad" filled the Grand. Opera-house
to the doors lest '.night notwithstanding
the rain, and the bl.g audience gave pro
fuse evidence of its appreciation, of the
many splendid features of the production
by applauding frequently and vigorously^
William Wolff as. the pirate, smuggler and
all-round bad man held the center <jf the
stage most of the time, but after all he
was only an incident. Edith Mason and
her two pickaninnies made the hit. From
a spectacular point of view there was very
little left to wish for. The evolutions of
the band of amazons and the coryphee
dances, with Senorita Matildita as the
central figure, were finely executed, while
the transformation scene at the close of
the performance was brilliant.
Alcazar. â¢
The second week of "Chimmle Fadden"
opened -with standing room only, and
with one of the most enthusiastic of audi
ences. The play, or rather the sketch, so
abounds in contrasts of light and shade,
with flashes of humor, that i: will not
soon become stale. Marie Howe's Mrs.
Murphy kept tho house bubbling with
merriment. -Davenport and Seabury dir
vided the honors with her. Chimmle
should draw "crowded houses all the week.
California.
.Â¦ "With Flying Colors," with Its many
thrilling situations and rampant villainy,
played to a large holiday audience last
evening. The Adelphl melodrama 19
splendidly staged and gives the leading
members of the frawley company many
opportunities. It will hold the boards
until Tuesday next, when Plnero's "Prin
cess and the Butterfly" will be produced
on an elaborate scale. . :-\: -\- ,Â¦ Â¦c.
Chutes.
"It wra & damp, wet New ' Tear at the-
ChtiteÂ«, but thÂ« entertainment provided
In the theater proved ail .-worth tho while
of the hundreds who braved the elements
to attend. Harry de Lain, a. high bary
tone from New York, proved a vocal sur
prise and won three recalls; Mo'ulton and
Vldella, triple horizontal bar performers,
cave a thrilling- arid agile act; Claude
Thardo, an eccentric story-teller and
singer, kept the house In a roar of laugh
ter for half an hour, and Major Mite sang
"The Georgia Camp Meeting" , in addi
tion to .other numbers. The rest uf the
bill was good. __Â¦ â¢

the newly appointed Coramlsslonere have
nothing at all- to do with It. They .must,
be contented with their offices, and expect

or .nearly all of Â¦ the- appointive positions'
of ' the different- departments.- He will
have the naming. of the secretaries of the
Board of Public Works, the- Civil Service

to- tjnxe and has been- told that many of
his claims to-, patronage were out of pro
portion, .to his services, it is a three
coriiered fight which is on . between the
three corners of the "organization" and

known that he. is of the opinion that If

CiSV yesterday afternoon, the girl, who
t __i7 is but 14 years of age. stole away
.-Â¦. from borne and jumped from the
, Â¦.;";Â¦ -ifieck of tb<? Creek routÂ© ferry boat
when off the Alameda Point ferry landing.
Ghe was rescued by Al Ropers and taken
to the revenue cutter McArthur, and af
terward to her home.
The prl. who, is large for her ag^. waa
the only passene'er on the 4 o'clock Creek
route boat Oarden City. It was a time
Df day when there are very few passen
gers bound toward this city by this line,
and she was noticed by various members
of the crew because she was alone. "She
flid not go on the upper deck, but re
mained below, and on the outside after
3eck: but even under these circumstances
she did not make any movement toward
jumping overboard until the boat was op
posite the old Alameda Point landins.
Without the least warning the girl sud
denly threw a little cape that she -wore
on the deck, and removed her jacket. An
umbrella was dropped with the other
things, and â¢ without the least hesitation
the plrl plunged over the rear end of the
boat and dropped Into the wake of the
ferry boat.
She made no cry and there were no wit
nesses to the plunce from the ferryboat,
there being no other passengrers and the
Kirl having chosen a time when the deck
hands were all forward. Fortune favored
her. however, for A I Rojrers. a builder of
boats, who lives at Alameda Point, save
her Jump from the passing steamer. He
was In hif boat at the time and he deter
mined to pave the frirl. particularly as he
saw that her act was not noticed from
the ferryboat. He made desperate efforts
to reach her In time, and did so just as
she was going out of sight for the last
time.
Captain 'Westenphal sfnt a boat from
the McArthur. but Ropers saved the girl.
She was then taken to the revenue cutter,
where p.hÂ«Â» was made comfortable, and hpr
