Kitchener Be
lieved to Have
Cut Off the
Retreat of the
Fleeing Com
mander-in-
Chief of the
Orange Free
State Forces.
LONDON, Feb. 20, 3:45
a. m. â A member of the
Cabinet told H. W. Lucy
to-night that the War Office had
received a telegram announcing
that General Cronje was hope
lessly surrounded.
Mr. Wyndham was beset by
anxious members of the House,
but would only reply that the
Government's news was ex
tremely satisfactory. The sole
explanation of the Government's
withholding good news is that
confirmation and more details
are awaited.
The situation as described by
correspondents over the Free
State border is tantalizing to the
public. The elementary facts are
the Boers are trekking eastward
toward Bloemfontein, with slow
lnoving baggage-trains, and that
they are pursued by Lord
Kitchener, with General Kelly-
Kenny's division. General Mac-
Donald, with the Highlanders,
made a forced march to Koo
doosrand ford, and on Sunday
pushed twenty miles eastward.
General French left Kimberley
Saturday, going east along the
Modder River.
Lord Kitchener is trying to
outmarch and outflank the
Boers, thus checking their re
treat, if possible, and driving
them back into the hands of
Mac Donald ar.d French.
The War Office message com
municated to Mr. Lucy seems to
indicate that Lord Kitchener has
either got ahead of the Boers or
is about to realize his plan, and
the War Office waits to an
nounce a decisive result.
Meanwhile Commandant De
larey, with the Boers from Coles
berg, is hanging on the right
flank of the British pursuing
columns, seeking to delay their
movement and so to assist the
Boer wagon-trains to escape.
Students of topography think
the Boers will hardly risk a fight
until they get into the rough
A Daily Mail correspondent,
who was with the British convoy
attacked by the Boers at Riet
River ford, wires:
"Ultimately the British aban
doned the convoy, in order not
to check the advance. Thus 200
wagons and 600 tons of stores
fell into the hands of the Boers,
though it is doubtful if they will
be able to carry them away."
General Buller has achieved a
real success seemingly in captur
ing the range of hills south of the
Tugela. It makes more feasible
another attempt to relieve Lady
smith.
The Queen has sent a direct
message to Lord Roberts con
gratulating him and his troops.
General French and Colonel
Kekewich have been acquainted
with their promotions.
Dr. Leyds, at Brussels, says
the Free State troops who were
besieging Ladysmith have with
drawn in order to defend their
homes. In this way he ac
counts for General Buller's suc
cess against the weakened forces.
He will forego his projected trip
to Rome, he says, because of
"decisive events now taking
place in the theater of war."
from Honey Nest Kloof arrived to-day. It
appears that the captured supplies are a
white elephant to the Boers, since they
are unable! to clear them away. There is
considerable probability that they will be
recovered. '

LONDON. Feb. 19.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day during the discussion of
the report of the Committee on Supply
on the vote for the addition of 120,000 men

BULLER'S MODEST
REPORT OF SUCCESS
LONDON, Feb. 19.â The War Office has
received the following dispatch from Gen
eral Buller:
"CHIEVELEY CAMP. Feb. 19.â 1 yes
terday moved around the enemy's flank.
The Queen's, who had bivouacked on the
northern slope of Cingrolo. crossed the
Nek and, supported, by the rest of the
Second Brigade, under Hlldyard, assault
ed and took the southern end of Monte
Christo.
"The Fourth Brigade, on the left or
western slope, and the Welsh Fusileers.
supported by the rest of the Sixth Bri
gade, assaulted the eastern flank of the
enemy's position, while the Second Bri
gade cavalry, on the extreme right,
watched the eastern slopes of Monte
Christo, and drove back those of the en
emy attempting to escape there from our
artillery fire. Assaulted by the heavy ar
tillery fire on their front and flank, and
attacked on their flank and rear, the en
emy made but slight resistance, and
abandoning their strong position were
driven across the Turela. I have taken
several camps, a wagon load of ammuni
tion, several wagons of stores and sup
plies and a few prisoners.
. "The weather has been Intensely hot
and the ground traversed was exceedingly
difficult, but the energy and dash of the
troops have been very pleasant to see.
They have all done splendidly. The work
of the irregular cavalry, the Queen's, the
Scots Fusileers and the Rifle BrlgayC. was
perhaps most noticeable, while the excel
lent practice of the artillery and naval
guns and the. steadiness of the gunners,
under at times very accurate fire, was re
markable. The accurate fire of the naval
guns from Chieveley was of great assist
ance.
"Our casualties are not, I think, many."
GENERAL BULLER NOW
HAS A GREAT CHANCE
LONDON. Feb. 20.â Spencer "Wilkinson,
reviewing the military situation in tha
Morning Post, dwells upon the importance
of the operations of Sir Redvers Buller
and says:
"Now Is General Butter's great chance.
Now is the time to throw himself with all
his might Into the task before him and tÂ«Â»
hit hard without counting losses too
closely. He will then probably defeat the
Boers and relieve Ladysmith this week.
Failing that, he will at any rate prevent
them from sending reinforcements to tha
Free State.
"From the comparative ease of the ope
rations so far. however. It looks as though
the Natal Boers had sent reinforcements
to General Cronje, who may be delaying
a fight by retreating until those reinforce
ments shall have had lime to reach him."
In conclusion Mr. Wilkinson reiterates
his statement that victories are more Im
portant than positions, adding: "No doubt
Lord Roberts has done the best that was
possible, but the essential thing still U to
destroy the Boer army."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â Senator Han
na to-day had a conference with tho Re
publican members of the House Mer

conference the whole aspect of the case
has been changed and the passage of the
bill is practically agreed upon. Another

The objection heretofore had to tho
original bill has been partly overcome,
and certain features will be eliminated
when It Is reported to the House. Ona
great objection to the Hanna-Payne
measure was it would allow a subsidy to
many old hulks and tank steamers, and
this will be avoided in some manner, pre
sumably by providing that ships applying
for a subsidy shall be examined by an
inspector and only first-class vessels al

BIG BATTLE ON
THE TUGELA EXPECTED
LONDON. Feb. 20.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mail from Lourenzo Marquez, dated
Monday, says:
"According to advices from Pretoria,
the Boers are expecting a. big battle on
the Tugela. They claim that seventy of
the Wiltshires were killed at Colesberg
and that thirty wagons with forage and
provisions were captured, but no ammu
nition. They thus describe the fighting
at Kimberley:
" 'The British came through Blaunbank
and attacked In two columns. While the
Boers were busily engaged with Lord
Roberts. General French, with 2000 caval
ry and six guns, succeeded In breaking
through the Boer lines. The Boers did
not seriously oppose General French's ad
vance, but confined their efforts to pre
venting the provisions getting, through. In
this they : succeeded, capturing 2000 head
of cattle. 100' wagons of provisions and
100 men.' "
The Chieveley correspondent of the
Daily News, telegraphing yesterday, sa>'s:
"We now : occupy all . the hills to the
right of Colenso.-on this side of the Tu
gela, including Hlangwane, which the
Boers evacuated last (Sunday) night. This
capture of Hlangwane hill is of great
strategical importance, as -the hill com
mands the flank of the Boer defenses at
Colenso'. A successful advance and the
recapture of the railway may be ex
pected."
The Daily Mall has the following dis
patch, dated Monday, from Pietermaritz
burg:
"It Is reported that Sir Redvers Buller
has captured Hlangwane hill. Large
numbers of Free Staters have left to meet
Lord Roberts' force. It Is believed that
a number of the/ Boers' big guns have
been taken back across the border."

ROBERTS' SUCCESS.
LONDON, Feb. 20.â The Standard's cor
respondent at Modder River, under date
of Sunday, Feb. 18, wires as follows:
"The magnificent success of the plan of
campaign of Lord Roberts must be
ascribed in great part, after full consider
ation has been given for careful and bril
liant strategy, to the extreme mobility of
the newly organized forces employed, but
this mobility has to be paid for. It In
volves a great " expenditure in horses.
Those of the Boers, for instance, are
nearly finished.
/'lt we are to retain our advantage there
must be an unstinted drawing upon every
possible source of supply throughout the
empire. Otherwise we shall be without
enough horses of the suitable kind to fur
nish the necessary remounts.
"The Infantry under Lord Roberts has
done some marvelous marching, mostly
at night. Its pluck and endurance have
gone very far toward iripuring the safety
and success of the cavalry operations."

tlon that Congress enters upon the government
of Torto Rico unrestrained by the provisions of
the constitution. This we deny. Those of us
who oppose this measure, I believe, without
exception, maintain that the bill cannot be
enacted into law without a total disregard and
violation of not simply the spirit but the ex
prees letter of the constitution. The Louisiana
Territory, Florida, Texas. California, New
Mexico, Oregon and Alaska have all been ac
quired under our constitution without a Jar or
strain to any of Its wise and beneficent provi
sions and without any debate for 1U amend
ment. Every foot of this vast domain was ac
quired and annexed under Democratic Presi
dents.
The Democratic party has always " favored
proper expansion. Those of us opposing this
measure are not basing our opposition to it on
the ground that It is a measure for expansion.
This is not a measure of expansion. Whether
the constitution of the United States is ex
tended to the Island of Porto Rico ex proprio
vleore or not.' It must be admitted .that when
we enter upon legislation for the Â¦ Island, as
Congress will do If it passes this bill, that
question will be put at rest and the territory
will then be a part of us.
The control of the President and military will
have ceased and the expansion as to the island
will have been completed. Legislation by Con
gress for the Island also makes It a part of the
United States. If this bill passes it must fol
low that It Is then a part of the United States.
This being true, the proposition which this bill
carries for unequal taxation of the island as a
portion of the United States is the boldest form
of Imperialism. The opposition to this bill
plants ltMlf upon this ground. The measure Is
Imperialism Itself. In the former acquisitions
to which I have referred no such measure as
the pending one was ever proposed or deemed
necessary- This effort, therefore, clearly mama
the dividing line between all former acquisi
tions and that of Porto Rico. t-\ ,
Richardson proceeded with an exhaust
ive legal argument to prove that the con
stitution extended over our new posses
sions, quoting numerous decisions of the
Supreme Court. He continued:
But nven If It be conceded that Con
gress has the power to legislate in accord
ance with the provisions of the pending bill,
then the exercise of such power would be un
wise. If we pfcss ithls ;.bJH it, will bean act of
Â¦bad faith toward the people .of Porto -Rico. T\>
are told that, the Inhabitants of that island
welcomed General 'Mile* unfl'.the armies of the
â¢United -States lrt July. .189$,- whan; they Invaded
their territory and struck down the power of
Spain. This they did because they were as
mired and confidently believed that as the tyr
annous shackles of Spain; were stricken from
them, they were to be admitted to the Immu
nities and blessings of our liberal institutions,
as welj .a*, our enlightened^ civilisation. Our
soldiers were hailed as 'redeemers. ' Why? It'
was because of the alluring promises held out
to the Inhabitants of the island by the United
States. ,
Shall we not, then, do our plain fluty ? Let
us vote down this moet dangerous . bill. I am
proud to be able to say that. In my opinion.

BREWERS' BILL PASSED.
Calls Up a House Discussion on the
War Tax.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â 1n the House
to-day Dollivar of lowa, from the Com
mittee on Ways and Means, moved the
passage, under suspension of the rule, of
the bill reported from the committee to
amend sections 5333 and 3341 of the Re
vised Statutes, relating to internal reve
nue tax on fermented liquors. The pur
pose of the bill, Doljivar said, was to
abolish the smaller packages of beer, one
sixth and one-eighth barrels. The bill,
he said, was asked for by the brewing
interests of the country. It would In no
wise affect the revenue. Fletcher (R.) of
Minnesota offered an amendment provid
ing that the bill shall not go into effect
until July 1. 1900. The amendment was
agreed to.
Sulzer (D.) of New York said he favored
the bill, but that it was merely a sop to
the brewers. What they really wanted
was the abolition of the war tax. He
thought the war revenue law should be
repealed. The Republicans, he said, had
promised to do that when the war was
over, but they had made no move in that
direction. He challenged . the leaders on
the other side to pay when they proposed
to repeal that law. which was used to pile
up money in the Treasury to be loaned
without interest to national banks.
Terry <D.) of Arkansas declared that the
Republicans were using the war taxes to
eke out the deficiencies .caused by the
Dingley law, which, he said, had proved
a most lamentable failure. The Republi
cans Jeered this remark, and continued to
Jeer when Terry said that the Republicans
dare not abolish their policy of criminal
aggression In the Philippines because of
the secret understanding with Great Brit
ain, and for the same reason dare not
offer a word of sympathy for the two re
publics straggling for liberty in South
Africa.
Otjen of Wisconsin, Rartholdt of Mis
souri and Bsbcock of Wisconsin urged the
passage of the bill In Justice to the brew
ers. The latter said that the brewers were
carrying the greatest tax burden In this
country (paying $72,000,000 of taxes) ani
were entitled to consideration. Bartlctt
of Georgia said the humble were asking
relief from the war taxes, and they shouH
be listened to as well as the rich associa
tion of brewers, who paid heavy cam
paign contributions.
The bill was passed without division.

a hundred years. ' â¢ .
â¢ Dalzell of Pennsylvania, 'thÂ« , ranking
member of the Ways and Means Commit
tee, followed In a legal and constitutional
argument in support of the contention of
the majority thdt the constitution did not
extend over- our new possessions. The
constitution, he said, 1 - was established by
the people of the United States for the
United States. It provided for the future
â¢admission of countries into the Union. and
expressly conferred upon Congress the
power to govern them as Territories until
they were admitted as States. -Â¦Â¦Â¦'. .
Dalzell expressed his opposition to free
trade with Porto Rico at this time. '. We
must be generous to Porto Rico, but Just
to ourselves. If; we must have- free trade
with Porto Rico, we must with the Philip
pines. The result might be the planting 1
of immense areas of sugar and tobacco.
The low wages paid would be a menace to
labor-in this country* . <
Turning to. the question of the consent
of th.c governed, Dalzell asserted that lit a
representative republic the right to gov
ern, did not depend upon the consent of
the governed. The methods of govern
ment prescribed by the principles of an
glican liberty as "practiced in the UnltiM
States would be. grotesque In the Philip
pine Islands and would bring to their peo
ple no advantage. They would be, in point
of fact, impossible of exercise.
"The guarantees of liberty," he conclud
ed, "do not exist alone in the constitu
tion of the United States. They do not de
pend upon the great instrument for their
strength and perpetuity. They would con
tinue to live and flourish if that constitu
tion were annihilated. They are the In
destructible heritage of humanity."

leagues to-day, introduced in the House
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â A simple res
olution of Inquiry introduced In the Sen
ate to-day by Hale of Maine precipitated
an hour's constitutional debate by some
of the ablest constitutional lawyers In the
body on the authority of Congress at its
pleasure to extend or withhold the con
stitution to â¢ territory \ acquired by the
United States. The bill providing a gov
ernment for the Territory of ' Hawaii was
under' consideration most of the after
noon, Cullom, In charge of the measure,
explaining in'detail its provisions.
On convening the Senate passed a bill
{or: the relief- of claimants having cases
pending against the United States In the
Circuit .and District Courts affected by
an act of IS9S.
Hale offered a resolution which, after a
long debate, was adopted, calling, upon
the commissioners of tne District-of Co
lumbia for information as to why i the
law of Congress relating to telephone
charges had riot been enforced and prac
tically was inoperative.
; Gallinger, Foraker and Platt of Con
uectlcut.called attention to the fact that
the. telephone charges r flxed by Congress
had been decided by a Judge of the Su
preme Court of the District of Columbia
to amount to a practical confiscation of
telephone property and In violation of
the constitutional provision against taking
property., without due process of law.
Each rather deprecated Congressional
action in the questioning of court de
cisions, whether satisfactory to Senators
or -not. Hale insisted- that the rights ot
the telephone monopoly In .the premises
should be passed upon by: the United
States Supreme Court.
Tillman at this point, having in mind
the extension of the constitution over the
insular possessions of the United State*,
precipitated a legal debate by inquiring
now the constitution extended over the
District of Columbia, if, as had been
maintained. Congress had plenary power
In the district.
Foraker replied that the constitution
extended over the district when It wan a
part of Virginia and Maryland and was
never withdrawn. He maintained that
Congress had ample authority. In his
judgment, to extend the constitution over
such territory as the United States might
acquire, or withhold it at will. Once ex
tended over territory Congress was bound
by its limitations.

two resolution aiming at the sugar trust.
The first is as follows:
Whereas, The prices of sugars have recently
several times been advanced, manufacturers
In each instance having agreed upon the named
price per pound, which is prima facie evidence
that a trust or combination exists for the pur
pose of destroying competition in order that
enormous profits may be realized;- that the
American Sugar Refining Company of New
Jersey having for many years paid 12 per cent
annually In dividends upon $36,968,000 of com
mon stock ; therefore. Â¦be It Â¦ . Â¦
â¢ Resolved. That sugars manufactured by the
said American Sugar Refining Company of New
Jon-ey and all other manufacturers in this
country shall, after six months from the pas
sage of this act. be prohibited by the Inter
state Commerce Commission from being trans
ported, in .any .manner whatsoever from one
fctate to another until the said commission are
satisfied' that sugars offered for Interstate
transportation have not yielded a profit to the
manufacturer thereof of more than 4 per cent
in excess of the. cost. of the same, which shall
be ascertained in such manner as the said com
mission in its discretion may determine. *
The second provides that:
Whereas, A monopoly exists among sugar
manufacturers and In consequence enormous
profits are being realized: therefore be it
Resolved. From and after the passage of
this resolution all kinds of sugars, molasses
and everything entering Into the manufacture
of sugars! shall be admitted free of duty from
Porto Rico. Cuba and the Hawaiian Islands.
â¢ Richardson, speaking of these resolu
tions, said: â¢â¢':-Â¦Â»;'-*: )>
The Interstate Commerce Commission, under
the constitution as interpreted by the Supreme
Court In the Addlston Pipe and Steel Com
pany and the-F. C. Knight Company case*,
has the power to : refuse Interstate transpor
tation to sugars and other manufactured ar
ticles which produce enormous profits through
monopolistic Control until' the profits on such
goods have been â¢ brought within fair and rea
sonable limits, and when .the necessities: of
life are Involved, as in sugars, if not In any
â¢other manufactured articles controlled by mo
nopolies, public sentiment will sustain- the
commission In the exercise of. such cower. In
order, however, through a specific govern
mental enactment .to make it mandatory for
the said commission to exercise that Dower I
have offered ,this non-partisan resolution. -
THE SITUATION IN KENTUCKY.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 18.â A political argument between ex-State Senator Charles J. Bronston of Lexington and
Claude Desna, chief clerk of the Senate, came near precipitating a shooting affray on a Chesapeake and. Ohio train crowded
with returning Democratic legislators to-ntght. Bronston Is said to have denounced the Goebel men as revolutionists, and
Desna, to whom the remarks were addressed, denominated Bronston as sy bolter. Angry words passed and Senator Bronston
drew a pistol. Several legislators stood between them and prevented trouble, y : â¢/ ,"
oveT a territory by Congress, could be
withdrawn by Congress.
Foraker replied that that question had
never arisen and probably never would
arise. Ho was inclined to the belief that
there might be difficulty In withdrawing
the constitution when once extended over
a territory.
The discussion of the constitutional
questions Involved took a wide range.
Lindsay of Kentucky was inclined to the
opinion, he said, that the constitution
could be extended or withheld from ac
quired territory. Vest of Missouri in
quired whether Chief Justice Marshall had
not decided that wherever the authority
and jurisdiction of the United States ex
tended the constitution also extended.
Lindsay did not think that- the entire
constitutional interpretation of. all the fu
ture ought to be based on* Chief Justice
Marshall's decision in that case. In re
sponse to Hoar, Lindsay said the appli
cation of the constitution had been ex
panded. Jefferson, he said, did not believe
a State could be created out of territory
not included within the original limits of
the United States, but nevertheless we
had advanced far beyond that point.
The bill providing for a government for
Hawaii was then taken up. Culloxn of
Illinois, in charge of the measure, ex
plained its provisions section by- section*
elaborating the necessarily condensed lan
guage of the bill. ' ' : . :
Tillman was disposed to criticise tho
bill, as indicated by his interruptions of
Cullom, because property and educational
qualifications for voters and office holders
were required. Inasmuch as objections
were raised In. this country to Southern
States demanding similar qualifications of
their voters.
Cullom said the matter had been con
sidered most carefully by the Foreign Re
lations Committee, and, as a means of
protecting the Interests of the Islands and
their citizens from disorder and confu
sion, the restricted suffrage qualifications
had been adoped.- No discrimination was
shown against any race or class of people
in Hawaii. Under the bill all were treat
ed with absolute equality.
Cullom explained as a particular reason
for earlier action upon the pending -bill
that the bubonic plague had created a
serious situation in Honolulu. Thirty
acres of the city were burned by i the
authorities to prevent | the spread â¢of the
plague. â¢ Eight thousand persons, home
less and nearly naked, were in quarantine
and were being supported by the other
citizens of Honolulu. The Hawaiian peo
ple had made a strong appeal for the en
actment .'of legislation . that would give
them the authority of .permanent govern
ment, and he hoped the measure might
be given speedy but thorough considera
tion.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 19.â Senator Clark
of Montana was again to-day the star
witness before the Senate Committee on
Privileges and Elections, notwithstanding
Dr. Treacey also was heard. Treacey,
Justice Hunt's physician, occupied the
entire forenoon sitting and a part of the
afternoon session. His statement con
cerning his Interviews with Justice Hunt
corroborated the testimony of the Justice
in all essential details except that his
recollection was that $50,000 and nut $IW.
Â©OO was the amount mentioned by him as
the price which the Justice should get
Cor having the Wellcome disbarment case
thrown out of the State Supreme Court.
He raid that Justice Hunt was an inti
mate friend and he asserted his motive in
taking the course he did to be to test
the Justice's ability to withstand the cor
rupting influence of money. He had re-
ceived no funds from any source to pay
the bribe suggested and had been prom
ised none for that purpose.
Clark necessarily went over much of
the ground covered by him In his testi
mony Saturday. He was cross-examined
by Campbell and insisted that he had
spent no money for corrupt purposes dur
ing the Montana Senatorial campaign.-- He
gave a detailed statement of expenditures
for political purposes during the legisla
tive and Senatorial contests, which footed
up. as Senator Turley announced, $139,000.
He declared that his only purpose in en
tering upon the campaign was the over
throw of Daly's rule in the State, which,
he Paid, was so tyrannical that he would
not desire to continue his residence in
the State If It were to continue.
It was eald to-day that Daly would go
on the stand in rebuttal. He is expected
any day.

Major General Joseph Wheeler. Lieuten
ant Fiscus, who is a son of former Sheriff

Wheeler when he was a cadet in West
Point, where General Wheeler's two sons
were hi* classmates. Miss Wheeler fre
quently visited her brothers there. When
the Spanish war broke out, young Fiscus
was among the first of West Point cadets
to receive a commission. He served with
distinction all through the Santiago cam
paign.
Soon after the surrender of Santiago.
Lieutenant Flscus was stricken with ty
phoid fever. He was brought north and
taken to Fort Wadsworth, where his life
was despaired of for a long time. When
he recovered. Lieutenant Flscus was aa
signed to duty in Porto Rico and later
in Â¦ the Philippines. The same transport
which carried Lieutenant Flseu*- to Ma

and Miss Annie Wheeler who was going
out as an army nurse. On the long voy

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The debate

bill, although 1 It applies only to Porto
Rico, involving as it does tha question oft
the power to govern ' our new possessions
outside the limitations " of the island, is
the moat Important measure which will
come before this Congress. Interest In

both sides, and there is urgent demand'
for time. The Democrats are solidly ar-j

have powerful support from .the; Repub-;

The debate to-day lacked exciting fea

material side of the situation which the
bill is designed to relieve. Richardson,
the Democratic leader, joined issue upon
the power of Congress to enact the pro
posed legislation, and Daizell of Pennsyl
vania backed up Payne with a constitu

listened to with close attention. Richard

nority, made the opening argument in op
position tÂ« the measure. Said he: ; .:Â¦. \

LONDON. Feb. 20.â The Daily Chronicle, In a rather alarming editorial to-day
regarding the Russian designs on the Afghan frontier, after reciting what Is
known of the position of affairs there, says:
"Both parties in Parliament have repeatedly assevented that the very next
stepâ that of Herat, means war. There Is no doubt that Russia could take
Herat to-morrow If slio liked. England would net-d a month to reach the
same objective. The only barrier between Russia and her prey Is a moral
one."
The Dally Chronicle then pictures India's means of defense, concluding
that Russia would probably not attempt to seize India,
NO MONOPOLY
ON THE NEWS
Â¦ Â¦ Â»
Decision Against Asso
ciated Press.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Feb. 19.â 1n the ap
peal of the Inter Ocean Publishing Com
pany against the Associated Press the
Supreme Court to-day rendered an opinion
reversing the decree entered by the* Cook
County Circuit Court and the Appellate
Court of the First District and remanding
the cause to the Circuit Court, with di
rections to enter a decree as prayed for
in tho original bill filed by the Inter Ocean
Publishing Company to restrain the Asso
ciated Press from suspending or expelling
the petitioner from Its membership and
from refusing to furnish It news, accord-
Ing to Its contract.
This bill set up the fact that the Asso
ciated Press haa been able to control the
business of buying and accumulating news
In Chicago and selling the same and had
thus created for itself an exclusive mo
nopoly, and to preserve such monopoly
had declared the Sun Printing and Pub
lishing Association a rival or competitor
in business and antagonistic to It, and
sought to prohibit its members from buy
ing news therefrom, under penalty of sus
pension or expulsion. It was also alleged
that the appellee had compelled some of
its members by threats to cease buying
the special news of the Sun Printing and
Publishing Association under Its contracts
with Its members, including the appell
lant. The appellee filed an answer to the
bill, and a hearing was had, the Circuit
Court dismissing the bill for want of
equity, and on appeal to the Appellate
Court this decree was affirmed. The Su
preme Court now reverses this decree and
remands the cause.
The opinion, written by Justice Phillips,
holds that the manner In which the cor
poration has used its franchise has
charged its business with a public inter
est: i
It has devoted Its property to a public usr
and has. In effect, granted to the puNlc inch
an Interest In Its use that it must submit to
be controlled by the public for the common
rood to the extent of the Interest it has thus
created la- the public in Its private property.
The sole purpose for which news was frathered
was that the same should be sold, and all
newspaper publishers destriny: to purchase such
news for publication are entitled to purchase
ttv same without discrimination against them.
The clause of the contract which sought to
restrict the appellant from obtaining- new* from
other sources than from appellee Is an attempt
at restriction upon trade and business among
the citizens of a common country. Competition
can never be held hostile to public Interests,
and efforts to prevent competition by contract
or otherwise can never be looked upon with
favor by the courts.
The court finds that the by-law of the
appellee corporation, which seeks to pre
vent its members publishing special or
other news or receiving such news from
any person declared by it hostile, 1? not
required for corporate purposes, nor In
cluded within the purposes of the creation
of the corporation. To enforce this by
law and contracts made under It -would

PREMIER SILVELA
RAISES A STORM
Says England Offered
Aid to Spain.
LONDON, Feb. 19.â A dispatch from
Madrid saying that Premier Siivela re
cently declared In the Senate that pre
vious to the war with the United States
the British Government consented to let
Spain have 8200 shells which were beln;
manufactured for her at the Maxims fac
tory at Placentia meets with vigorous de
nial In London. Albert Vickers, head oÂ£
the Vickers Maxim firm, said:
"Senor Sllvela lied. There is not a word
of truth in this allegation that England,
helped Spain to fight the United States.
In the first place, the factory at Placentia
is a branch of our concern, built at tha
request of Spain, because that country
wanted ammunition of home manufacture.
It Is under the Spanish Government's con
trol, and there ne%'er was a shell manu
factured there for sale In England or la
any country except Spain, where a law
against the export of ammunition exists."
Senor Sllvela is further quoted as say-
Ing that Spain, not having used the shells,
allowed them to be returned to the Britlsti
Government and that he did not consider
the latter step a violation of neutrality.
This transactioa also Vickers denied. In
quiries made at the Foreign Office show
that no papers exist dealing with any
such transaction: but Lord Salisbury took
the matter up personally, instituting: In
quiries in *he various departments with
the view of issnilng a denial should It bÂ«
proved that Senor Siivela has been cor
rectly quoted. The3e inquiries of tho
Premier resulted In an official statement
being made to the effect that the British.
Government never entered into any such
transaction, and if the Vickers Maxim
Company undertook It the concern did so
without the knowledge of the Govern
ment.

BOLT OF THE
ANTI-FUSION
POPULISTS
?
Walk Out of the National
Committee Meeting
at Lincoln.
BRYAN'S FRIENDS
IN THE SADDLE
Presidential Coareation to BÂ» Held in Con
junction With That of the
Democrats
* <
LINCOLN. Neb. Feb. 19.â A split and a
walkout followed a turbulent meeting of
the Populist National Committee to-night.
the anti-fusion leaders, after having a
cumber of their followers turned down by
the credentials committee, organizing a
bolt and forming a new committee. The
members favorable to fUÃlon. after adopt
ing the report of the credentials commit
tee, adjourned until to-morrow, when in
all likelihood they will empower the chair
man or a committee to call the national
convention for the same city and at the
tame time the Democratic convention ie
held.
Caucnsea and conferences this morning
among the contending factions betokened
an Inharmonious meeting of tfte full com
mittee, which began at 3 p. m. in the Kep
resentaUve hall of the State Capitol, and
the Indications that breakers were ahead
were emphasized ten minute* after Chair
man Butler called the committee to order
and announced that It would at once go
into executive Eesslon. The differences of
the members, of whom there were about
eighty present, but holding proxies for
nearly the full committee, hinged pri
marily on the old question of fusion. The
element led by Senator Allen, with appar
ently the etrongeet following. Insisted on
fusion, anfl, to that end. that a committee
be appointed with power to call the con
vention for the same day and place as the
Democrats. Senator Allen said:
"I am not In favor of admitting to the
committee meeting this afternoon or
recognizing as members of the commit
tee any man who participated In the Cin
cinnati convention that nominated Bar
ker and Donnelly for .President and Vice
President. I am not in favor of recogniz
ing proxies from such men, neither am I
In favor of recognizing any such man
who sends a proxy. I do not believe the
committee should admit any member who
Is supporting a ticket other than the one
to be nominated In the convention this
committee shall call. The committee
ehould throw over the transom every
member who has no right to participate
in these deliberations, and I believe It
will do it.'
J. A. Parker of Kentucky replied on be
half of the middle-of-the-roadâ or anti
fusion â men.
The calling of the list of commttteemen
proceeded without Incident to the end.
when Parker asked why the proxy of
Committeeman A. W. Files of Arkansas
and Robert McÃeynolds of Lincoln had
been omitted. Robert Schilling of Wis
consin said he challenged the right of
any man to sit in the meeting, regardless
of his credentials, who had taken part In
the Cincinnati convention which nom
inated Barker and Donnelly.
Chairman Butler ruled that the whole
matter must go to the committee on cre
dentials, and he thereupon appointed as
such committee Allen of Nebraska.
Weaver of lowa and Tracey of Texas, all
of the fusion faction, and declared the
meeting adjourned, amid the protests of
the middle-of-the-roadsters, who de
nounced his action as partisan. When
the committee reassembled at 8:45 the
anti-fusionists presented the following
proposition:
That the commute* recorniied only leral
proxies. *:arr.x>ed with reveDU* stamps, ac
corfiin* to law.
That the roll of the meeting at Omaha In
ISGS be accepted with the roll of this commit
tee, except where subsequent State conven
tions have elected new members, excert that
cases of contests ehail to before a committee
composed of fire members, two to be selected
by the friends of Butler two by friends of
Parker, these four to select a fifth member,
and tÂ»<Â»t. in Fettlinu these contests, no votes
are to be cast on these cases by either con
â¢-Â¦Â«> or contestants until all contests are
6-tlled.
This proposition represents fifty-seven votes
in this convention, which is a rood majority
of the members in attendance here and we
demand these propositions in the name of the
honert Populists of this nation who are op
posed to rascality in politics.
This was signed by Jo A. Parker of Ken
tucky. R. H. H. Wheeler of Ohio. Newt
<iresham of Texas, J. B. Osborne of Geor
gia. J. L. Knott of Maine, Robert Mc-
Keynolds of Arkansas and D. Clem De
ver of Nebraska, together with a number
of others not committeemen. The propo
sition was ignored by the full committee.
The committee on credentials reported,
excluding all but five of the anti-fusion
members, and in tne midst of an uproar
the middle-of-the-roadsters, led by Par
ker of Kentucky and Welles of lowa, left
the hail, engaged a room downtown and
organized a bolting meeting.
The main convention shortly before mid
night, without deciding on a date or place
for the national convention, adjourned un
til to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
The bolters secured a room at the Grand
Hotel, prepared an address and called a
rational convention for Cincinnati, Ohio,
en Wednesday, May 9.

SAUSALITO, Feb. 19.â A1l day long
the town of Sausalito has been
waiting In vain for news from the
search party that has been dragging
the lake where Joseph Tsheida, Jo
seph Fernandez and Sydney Sylvey. three
of the town's most popular boys, are
supposed to have met their deaths by
their boat capsizing last night.
The boys had organized a duck hunt
and selected a little lake near Point Bo
nlta as the scene of their operations.
Yesterday Charles Martin, who had been
sent by Tsheida's mother with a lunch to
the boys, whose continued absence had
aroused her fears, made the discovery
which filled the town with apprehension.
The sight which greeted his eyes was an
upturned boat tossing on. the center of the
little lake, while on the shore, almost at
his feet, the soft hat worn by Sylvey was
washed up. Martin, after endeavoring to
obtain some clew to the bo3 - s' where
abouts, left for town. On his arrival the
news of the boys' loss spread. A search
party, headed by J. and A. Susavilla, left
for the lake. Up to late this evening the
dragnets had brought to light no trace of
the missing boys. A curious feature of
the catastrophe is the fact that Tsheida
was born within a stone's throw of the
lake where he may have met his death.
All kinds of theories are afloat as to the
maner In which the craft occupied by the
boys capsized, the most plausible -one
seeming to be that one of them stood up in
the boat for some purpose and a sudden
lurch overbalancing him the others met
their death in an effort to save their
drowning comrade's life. Sylvey was
known to be tho only one of the party
who could swim.
L. Gioll, a farmer living near the scene,
tells of hearing a wild cry from the di
rection of the lake at about 4 o'clock on
the morning when the accident occurred.
John Ferguson, the stepfather of Syl
vey, was over to-day and offered the
searchers a reward for the recovery of his
stepson's body.
The loss of the three has plunged the
town in gloom, as all entertained a sin
cere feeling of good will for the boys
whose bodies may now be lying at the
bottom of the little lake on whose surface
they were to have spent their holiday.
LECTURES TO
FRUIT GROWERS
Opening of the Course
at Stanford.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 19.-
The special course of lectures to be given
by Stanford University to the fruit grow
ers of California commenced to-day.
Fully a hundred of the most prominent
horticulturists of the State are in attend
ance, many of them being accompanied
by their families, who will spend the
Â¦week visiting the university and attend
ing the lectures that have been specially
prepared for them.
The course will extend through five
days, closing on Friday next. Among the
lecturers are the leading members of the
faculty, besides men prominent in com
merce and agriculture and fruit growing.
The first lecture of the series wa* de
livered by President Jordan en "The Uni
versity and the Fruit Grower." In his
talk ho showed the many different -ways
in which the university can benefit the
farmers and horticulturists, not so much
by hints bearing upon the routine side of
their trade as by work which required ln
etruments and laboratories. The univer
sity does not intend to drill the fruit
growers or to inspire them or to teach
them to investigate, but it ought to be of
some practical help to them in a different
way. Continuing, he said:
We *re all of us engaged Jn the bloodless
battle of civilization. The enemy Is right upon
you and you have no time to consider. You
must fight your Insect pests as best you can
without stopping to investigate. But we of the
university have both the leisure and instru
ments of precision which enable us to find out
the difference between one insect and another.
So the university lias the advantage of time.
Instruments and method.
In come respects the vision of you practical
men in matters pertainlnK to your work Is
clearer than ourÂ«, but you are bound to lack
perspective. In the very nature of things you
mutt be at the mercy of quarks In various
lines simply became you have not time to In
vestigate. We have tested some of these diffi
culties and Invite you here that wÂ« may ac
quaint you with our results and In a measure
lessen the Injury that you receive through wen
sources. tVe have tested the solid, of your
State, we hare studied how plants grow, we
have delved into the laws of heredity and the
reasons for like producing like that we might
e.%al>le the world to live and Improve. If: we
ha\e found out what it Is that hurts you and
can enable you to destroy your enemies and
pr^erve your fnends our meeting with you
will not be without oractlcal value.
Professor Frank A. Fetter of the de
partment of economics next spoke upon
"The Growth of Markets." saying In part:
Every improvement in the means of commu
nication and transportation tends to widen
markets. The group of men, buyers and sellÂ«rn.
who are acquainted with each other in close
business relations fix the boundaries of a mar
ket Until every spot on earth knows exactly
what every other spot is doing we cannot have
the ideal market. Early In the neventeenth
century the leading nation? of the world began
the colonization of. foreign lands In order to
provide markets for their home products. When
the American colonies rebelled It wan because
they objected to being exploited 'or commercial
reasons.
There ! are three economic principles tp bear
in mind when studying the subject of markets:
First, that the values exchanged In foreign
trade are not all profits. Probably not over
10 per cent of the gum is profit, even to , the
producer, while the gain to the nation is not
nearly equal to the Individual gain. The best
trade for a nation is that which comes of Its
own accord, without the expense of. armies and
navies. ' Many nations pay more than a dollar
to do m dollar's worth of business.
Second, the largest customers come from the
most civilized nations. As a source of demand,
England's non-tropical colonies are worth
twenty times as much as her tropical depen
dencies, while as producers they are thirty-five
times as valuable.
Third, the elementary fundamental principle
of commerce, that exports must eventually pay
for Imports, should be thoroughly understood.
The Increase of our exports of merchandise and
manufacturers must be paid for by equal val
ues of lmpcrts. These naturally would be to a
large decree tropical products, but our refusal
to accept the Imports of Europe puts a greater
premium on tropical rroductf>.
If the troMcal countries like the Philippines
are to absorb laree amounts of our manufac
tures they must pay In what they can produce.
We cannot expect it to be In manufactures
or In raw food products. It will be In the trop
ical Droducts of a kind produced In the balmy
climate of California more than in any other
part of the United States. We shall find It
useless to attempt to force goods Into a coun
try without taking a return of goods. The
only way to avoid this principle is to send a
large standing army abroad, pay out millions
for Its support, then send goods abroad for It
to buy. with the money we have furnished.
In the regular commercial methods of widen
ing the home market lies tne nope of the Cali
fornia fruit industry. But In this new mad
ness for world markets that has been raised by
the victories of the navy there appears to be a
polite Invitation by the manufacturers for the
fruit men to Join in the fascinating sport of
hunting snipe with the hope of a reward that
has no existence.
Professor John H. Comstock of the
local faculty, who Is the most celebrated
entomologist of the country, was the last
of the speakers, taking as his subject "In
sect Life." He said In part:
Economic entomology has reached its highest
development in the United States, and Cali
fornia fruit trowers have made more extended
use of the applications of this science than has
been done by the agriculturists of any other
section. Economic , entomology, however. Is
merely the application of a science. And the
hortlcultlst who alms to apply the results of
this science intelligently needs something more
than thumb rules. To be able to meet the new
conditions that are constantly arising one must
know something of the fundamental principles
of the science to be applied. We, therefore,
have begun this series of entomological lectures
with a study of the structure and development
of Insects, and approach it from the stand
point of the university and by a use of Its
methods. Â¦ .
He then took up the structure and de
velopment of Insects, after tho lecture
giving an exhibition of specimens illus
trating their structure and metamor
phosis. .-, Â¦",''; .

SANTA ROSA, Feb. 19.â There is a man
who deliberately stole and ran away with
a locomotive, was caught and is sorry.
Shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon Wil
liam Thompson, a young man who for
merly resided here, climbed into the
empty cab of one of the California North
western Railway Company's engines
standing on a track at Sebastopol, pulled
open the throttle and took a straight
snoot for this city, where he arrived at
half-past 1. breaking: all records and
startling yardmen by his sudden and un
expected appearance after dashing
through the yard.
Thompson stopped the engine at the out
skirts of the city and tried to make him
self scarce. He had been recognized,
however, by yardmen and was arrested
shortly afterward and lodged in jail
When asked what he meant by his action
ho replied that he was in Sebastopol and
wanted to come to Santa Rosa and did
not know of any easier or quicker way
than the one he adopted to get here.
Thompson was formerly a fireman for tho
Southern Pacific Company.
SANTA ROSA. Feb. 19.â Later in the
day . Thompson was placed in a padded
cell as a precautionary measure. He
claims that the engine belonged to him,
having purchased it from President A. W.
Foster several years ago. It is thought
the prisoner Is suffering from a fit of In
sanity brought on by excessive use of

them all. He augurs even greater suc
cess for to-morrow night's entertainment,
basing his Judgment on the excellence of
the numbers to be presented.
The programme will open with an ex
hibition drill by the military department
of the Columbia Park Boys r Club. Two
companies, comprising twenty boys, each
not over twelve years of age, will drill. In
battalion movements. The boys will also
give a competitive drill. The maneuvers
of the youngsters are highly interesting
and the military precision with which
they, execute difficult movements will
surely arouse wonder and applause.
A "home-trainer" bicycle race will be
the next event and will create great ex
citement. The leading amateur cyclists
of the coast, members of the club, will
participate. George P.* Fuller will be
pitted against E. F. Rtiss, Ed O. Krag
ness and H. D. Bean will compete, and H.
Anthony and M. Davis will try to out
speed each other. Great speed can be at
tained on these machines and large dials
will inform the spectators the distance
traveled 'by each contestant. The riders
will be started on their journey by pistol
fire and official timers will hold watches
on each event. Indoor records will prob
ably be broken, as the men have trained
for the races.
Charles Stanley will give a slack-wire
performance in Irish costume. He Is an
artist In his line and will give a funny
performance. Harry Irwin, a clever ama
teur pole-vaulter, will try to break the
record In that event. Miss Beatrice Car
ma's sweet soprano voice will be heard
in popular melodies; Slgnor Abramoff
will favor with a. few operatic selections
and William No rden will render a tenor
solo.'
One of the startling events on the pro
gramme will be an exhibition of a new
mode of self-defense by J J. O'Briene and
K. Inoue. Both men have just come from
Japan, where the art of placing an oppo
nent hors.de combat by sudden holds Is
practiced. O'Briene was connected i with
the Police Department at Nagasaki and
Inoue, a magnificently built Japanese, Is
an expert at the game. The exhibition is
said to be more exciting than wrestling.
Chief Sullivan and commissioners of the
Police Department have been invited to
see the men work and it is not at' all Im
probable that O'Briene will be employed
to instruct the, local department on the
fine points of the game. The London po
lice nave been instructed in the art and
are now able to handle violent prisoners
with ease.
Medals won by victors' in the swim
ming and w.restllng tournaments will, be
distributed. Singer and Hanlon will per
form on the Roman rings; Junior ; mem
bers will box <and the programme will
close with â¢a 1a 1 tug of war between teams
from the Lowell and Polytechnic High
Schools. An orchestra will discourse music
during the evening. * .
NEW SMELTING WORKS
SOON TO BE BUILT
Another big smelting plant will soon be
constructed at Bull Point, a small prom
ontory situated a few miles above Mar
tinez. An agent of Frank Gardner, for
merly of this city, but now. of London and
Paris, has acquired title to the land, and
is now In consultation with some contrac
tors, who have submitted plans for the
gigantic plant. The building of the plant,
which will include a modern refinery for
the handling of all base ores, will, it Is
said, cost over a million and a half of dol
lars. . ,
The funds. It Is understood," will be fur
nished mostly by French capitalists. Bull
Point has been selected as the most suit
able site for the smelting works because-
It can be reached by deep water vessels
and has close communication with the
Southern Pacific Company's northern line.

EASY FOR
SHARKEY
Knocked Out in the Second
' Round and Referee Says
"Fake/
DETROIT. Feb. IP.â Tom Sharkey to
fcigfct knocked out Jim Jeffords, the Cali
fornia aspirant for heavyweight honors.
In the second round of what was to have
been a ten-round bout. 'The' men ' had
fought two minutes ajid six seconds In the
second round when the knockout was de
livered. 1 hey were â¢ breaking from i a
clinch. Sharkey whipped his right over
to ihe Californlan's head and Jeffords
want down. Referee Hogan counted him
out. and it was several minutes before
be recovered sufficiently to talk. Then
he claimed a foul, saying Sharkey hit him
in liie breakaway, although they had
agreed to break clean. The referee, how
over, refuted to entertain his "kick" and
awarded the fight to Sharkey.
There was no preliminary llddling in the
first round. The men met in the cen
ter of The rirc and mixed It from
the start. As they came to a clinch,
both clipped and fell to the floor. Sharkey
kept rushing Jt-ffords. and Just before the
end of the round sent him to the floor.
Jeffords was tired and stayed on his
kn^es for several secor.dÃ.
When they came up for the second
round the Californian seemed in good
Fh&pe. Sharkey went right after him
from the start. He cut Jeffords' left eye
open and then kept it bleeding with right
iiand punches. The men were in Jeffords'
corner when thÂ«? knockout occurred.
Sharkey broke from a clinch and pent his
right over on the tall man's head. 'Jet
fords lurched forward, went to his Knees
and then turned over on his breast. He
was completely out, but Referee Hogan
knelt down and shouted the seconds into
thÂ« prostrate man's ear.
At the count of ten Hoeran declared
Eharkey the winner, amid cries of
"Foul" from the spectators, who thought
the sailor had hit Jeffords in the clinch.
This was not true, ac the men had both
arms free when the blow was delivered.
About SjOO persons witnessed the bout,
which was pulled off in the Light Guard
Armory under the auspices of the Cadil
lac Athletic Club. After the men had
p<vr.e to their dressing rooms Referee Ho
iraji expressed th<? opinion that Jeffords
"laid down." Some of the sporting men

respects similar to the one now. standing.
This mode of procedure was necessary, as

THE Columbia Athletic Club haÂ»

featherweight, is scheduled to box
twenty rounds with "Billy" DÂ« Cour

bouts between amateurs of lesser note
are arranged for the same evening. Â¦
Cole has trained hard for the bout
at Blanken's Six Mile House and Is
anxious to prove to the public that he
can make a better showing than he
did when he fought Clarence Rltchey.
At that time he was unfit to enter the
ring, but did so, so as not to disap
point the management. When he steps
beneath the ropes on Wednesday night
he will be in fine fettle, and will put
up a slashing battle. He has no easy
"mark" in De Coursey, Judging by the
latter's record. De Coursey began
fighting in 1897. His first ring fight
HARD KNOT
BECOMES A
CRACKAJACK
Finishes Ahead of Potente,
Daisy F and Scotch Plaid.
Tanforan Results.
Jun a little rain on the track, hardly
enough to Boil a pair of patent leathers,
Played some queer pranks with the
"dope," as the form book is affectionately
termed, down at Tanforan yesterday.
How and why Hard Knot won the mile
galloping, with Potente, thÂ«< favorite, an
indecent third, and Daisy F., second
choice, a bad fourth, the good book falls
to give up. After hie recent clever vic
tory over Zoroaster, which latter horse
on Saturday ran Gtoyser to a head,
Potente looked a cherry ripe 4 to 5 chance.
The books were pleased to lay 6 to 5 about
him at post time, and peddled out a large
collection of Daisy P. tickets at 3 to 1.
When Harry Thoburn, a horse with no
liking for a mile, had tired In the stretch
I after cutting out the pace, Vittltoe let out
a wrap, and Hard Knot fairly bounced in
first, over a length in front of the out
sider in 1:42 VÂ». The favorite, never better
than third, was four lenghts further be
hind, followed by Daisy F., six lengths
away, then ' Scotch Plaid. Topmast and
the quarter pole. The winner was well
played by a certain few at odds of 7 to L
un Saturday last this same horse was
backed for a "killing," on which occasion
Mooorito. a 1 to 3 favorite, obligingly ran
a miserable race. Such a thing as Hard
Knot beating Potente Is possible, but can
his disgraceful' defeat by Harry Thoburn
be accounted for? The judges are.alto
gether too lenient, and If a reform Is not
inaugurated the public, already In an un
certain condition, will cease to patronize
the track.
Three favorite* were slaughtered, while
three others took purses. The attendance
was light.
Walter Jennings sent Vesuvlan to the
post for the first time, In the opening six
furlong dash, and the colt had an easy
time dr It. A 4 to 5 favorite. Spencer got
him away flying, and he won galloping
from Mountebank and Bandera.
Corrigan's two-year-old, M. F. Tarpey,
fell heir to another purse in the next num
ber. Mustered in with a bunch of bad
ones, he ruled a 1 to 6 choice, winning at
leisure from Scotch Belle. Girly Ducat
lost the show to On Time.
Nearly all the "wise" money went In on
Captive to win the fourth event. Loading
almost from the Jump, the old fellow lea
Espirando over the mark three lengths.
Phelan rode Mortgage, the favorite, so
well that he finished third.
T. Walsh, the pilot of Potente, also had
the leg up on Wyoming, favorite for the
mile selling run. Notwithstanding the
stanch support accorded the horse, his
odds went from 2 to 3 to 1, and Walsh got
left at the post. In a driving finish, Es
pionage, with "Joe" Martin up, downed
Perseus a scant head.
Sybaris took the last race In clever
fashion. Dr. Rowell's sprinter closed a
6 to a favorite, and was first at the wire,
more than a length before Montallade.
Track Notes.
Sixteen superbly bred thoroughbreds,
the property of Marcus Daly, and now in
training under the supervision of Dan
Dennlson. will be sold at Occidental
Horse Exchange this evening.
Fifteen books cut In yesterday. Among
the number was Joe Rose, but recently
warned off Oakland track for alleged
complicity in the peculiar running of the
horse Red Pirate. It is said that no
sooner was the ruling rendered than Mr.
Rose wa%_notified by the Tariforan Asso
ciation that he was welcome to book on
its track.
Jockey Willie Martin was a good win
ner by the victory of Hard Knot, cash-
Ing tickets calling for about $1100. He
also backed the horse on Saturday last.
It was thought Ed. Lanigan bought a
gold brick when he got Hard Knot, but
under Denny Lynch's clever handling he
will probably come out winner over the
deal.

LADY EXEMPT.
Made an Honorary Member of the Old
Volunteer Fire Association.
Mrs. Jessup, the wife, of A. J. Jessup,
who for nearly a quarter of a century
was the vice president of the Exempt Fire
Association, was last evening made an
honorary member of v that association, be
ing the first lady In the history of the
old veterans, upon whom such an honor
has been conferred. The reason for this
distinction is that Mrs. Jessup discovered
that the old men who were the firemen in

Beginning.
Â»
COMMISSIONERS GIVE NOTICE
?
PRIZE IS THE COMMERCE OF
THE PACIFIC STATES.
Â»
Battle Will Commence in Los Angeles
in March and Conflict Will Then
Extend From South to
Puget Sound.
At last the long expected communica
tion has been received in this city fixing
definitely a date for the beginning of the
bearing before the Interstate Commerce
Commission of the witnesses and counsel
for the Pacific Coast Jobbers and Manu
facturers' Association. The Commission
ers will be In Los Angeles March 27 and
In San Francisco. April 2. At Los Angeles
the matter of routing freight will be taken
up, and then a part of the testimony In
behalf of tho Jobbers and manufacturers
may be heard. If so, that will do away
with the necessity for the coming of wit
nesses from the southern part of the State
to this city..
It is now thought probable that the-
Commlssloners will also go to Portland,
where the Portland, Seattle and Tacoma
manufacturers and Jobbers may testify.
Possibly only the San Francisco and Sac
ramento witnesses will be heard In this
city and the proceedings thereby be short
ened. Still, the Jobbers think the session
in San Francisco will last about a fort
night, for the details are many and there
are representatives of all the leading lines
of coast business to be heard and also
cross-examined by the lawyers from St.
Louis.
A vast amount of work has been per
formed to get the case ready for hearing.
The testimony, will deal with several In
teresting phases of the question of differ
entials. An Investigation has shown that
the differentials amount to only about one
per cent on the value of the goods shipped
from the East to Ban Francisco, bo the
plea of St. Louis Jobbers that the differ
entials prevent them from doing business
on the Pacific Coast is without basis in
fact.
Another fact of great Importance has
been developed. The distance from New
York to St. Louis is about one-third of
the distance to' San Francisco. Conse
quently the differentials to San Francisco
and all other Pacific Coast points ought
to be three times as large as the St. Louis
differential, upon a mileage basis, or
much larger than the Pacific Coast differ
ential now existing. There will probably
be between -fifty and sixty witnesses to
testify in this city, and quite a number
In Portland and Los Angeles.
No hearing in late years has such ma
terial interest for the people of the coast.
If the -graded rates that the St. Louis
Jobbers ask for are put Into effect, and the
differential based on water competition is
abolished, as they wish, they will come
pretty near taking away all the territory
for business purposes that the Pacific
Coast Jobbers and manufacturers now
have.
PROHIBITS THE SALE
OF CONDEMNED MEAT
Board of Health to Stop Auction of
Quartermaster's Supplies â Dis
ease Breeding Pools South,
of Holly Park.
At a meeting of the Board of . Health
last night there was considerable discus
sion over the possible danger to the health
of the community that might result from
the proposed sale of condemned quarter
master's supplies by the military author
ities, advertised to take place Tuesday
and Thursday of this week. The first
batch of supplies consists of a number of
thousand pounds, of condemned pork, ba
con and canned beef. The other lot con
sists of tents, bedding and general camp
equippage.
Dr. McCarthy ' declared that it was the
duty of the board to prohibit the sale of
the condemned meat and to compel the
thorough disinfection of thp tents and
bidding before allowing the auction to
take place. Health Olhcer O'Brien was
instructed to see that this was done if
after an investigation ha should deem
such measures necessary-
The health olficer was Instructed to call
the attention of the Board of Public
Wcrks to the unsanitary condition of the
district south of Holly Park, bounded by
Cortland avenue, Andover street. East
avenue and Bennington street. According
to the report of Sanitary' Inspector Green
the place Is deficient in sewers and those
constructed are not provided with outlets,
and a pool of stagnant, filthy water, with
no drainage, occupies the center of a va
cant lot adjoining the Bernal School,
where over 500 pupils attend. . . â¢ '
Chairman d'Ancona;of the Supervisors'
Hospital Committee notified the board
that unless it could find some way to cut
down the expenses of the City and County
Hospital about $300 a month the institu
tion would have to be closed during the
last two months of the fiscal year.
The resolution recently passed relating
to the fumigation of lodging houses was
rescinded owing to lack of funds.
Secretary Brown reported that the ex
penses of the City and County and the
Twenty-sixth street hospitals. Including
salaries, for the month of February footed
up $2649 40. and the expenses of the health
office and Emergency Hospital for the
same period $7300 76.

placing that branch In charge of the sec
ond vice president, who shall call to his
aid twenty members of the order from
this city, and that In those places outslda
of the city where such auxiliary lodges
exist there shall be a special organizer in
each place, who may call upon members

SCHOONER METHA NELSON ESCAPES A MONSTER WATERSPOUT
THE schooner Meiha Nelson arrived In port from Makawell yesterday. Sunday afternoon the vessel had a narrow Q
escape from a waterspout. She was off Point Reyes and Captain Rice and his men were congratulating them- !?
selves on the near ending of the voyage. Suddenly the sky became overcast, the wind began to come In puffs and ?
tne water began to bolL In the distance the sailors saw a waterspout headed toward them, and for a few mo- Â«S
ments Jt looked as though their last hour had come. Luckily the spout changed Its course and sailed away In another ?
direction. . * SÂ£
The sudden changes In the wind and the pitching and tossing of the Metha Nelson caused the spanker boom to ?
snap, and that was all the damage sustained. The schooner brings a large cargo of sugar from Makaweli, and after V

MUSEUM PROMOTERS
HAVE PLANS READY
Lacking a Quorum Last Evening All
Action Was Postponed Until .
Next Tuesday.
Fifteen members of the promotion com
mittee of the Commercial Museum met at
the rooms of tho Board of Trade last
ever.lr.gr for the purpose of' considering
and adopting the plan of organization
suggested by the committee of ten who
were appointed at the first meeting. As
there are forty members of the promotion
committee, and Jifty-flve. by reason of
augmentation subfftqufnt to the â¢ first
meeting, will be entitled to be promoters,
no action was taken to adopt the plan.
All the time was passed 'in deciding
what would be the best time to meet to
get a full attÂ»ndance at another meeting
and In discussing how to persuade the ab
sentee? to come. There were so many days
proposed for the meeting that finally the
roll \ras called, and each gentleman ex
pressed his choice of days. That method
brought out a majority for Tuesday, Feb
ruary 77. Some one suggested that the
meeting be held in the evening, but then
it was remembered that the Mardi Gras
ball would take place that evening, 'and so
the afternoon was selected Instead. W. R.
Wheeler paid that every one of those
present should consider himself a . com
mittee of one to bring in another mem
ber. Lipman Sachs wanted to have all
the notices sent out, registered to attract
more attention on the part of those who re
relved them. Craiple Sharp said that they
ought all to be notified by telephone -on
the morning of the meeting. Some way
will be devised to get a quorum. A. A.

M'DONALD'S AFFIDAVIT
SAID TO BE INSPIRED
Effort to Show That the Manauense
, Was Owned by an American
Company Ruled Out.
There was a short session yesterday
forenoon at the British Consul's office In
the Investigation into the condition of the
transport . Manauense. Chief Engineer
McDonald completed his testimony.
He was asked as to the circumstances
under which he had' signed an affidavit
before Notary James M. Ellis on Febru
ary 5. His answer was that- he had be
come bo much attached to the ship that he
thought she" was doing all right. One of
the owners had requested him; he said, to
put the matter In as good a light as he
could, but what he had stated in the af
fidavit was what he believed at the time.
Attorney H. W. Hutton offered to prove
that the vessel was owned by the Western
Commercial Company, which, he contend
ed, was a California corporation, but ob
jection was made, and the Consul declined
to go Into that matter. The record would
be the best evidence on that point, he
said. Mr. Hutton. then introduced tho
purser's record to show that during the
period in which it was charged that Mc-
Donald was drunk ho had bought no liquor
for the period of six days except one pint
of beer. Â¦
The further hearing was continued un
til to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock.

EXCITING CHASE AFTER
A WOULD-BE MURDERER
CHARLES SHAW TRIES TO KTLL
NOBA BIRCH.
Attempts to Stab Her With a KnlfeÂ»
but the Landlady In
terferes. .
ThÂ« rolice and a posse of south-of-
Market -street citizens had an exciting
chase after a would-be woman slayer last
evening, which terminated In the capture
of Charles Shaw, a waiter, who was
charged at the City Prison with an as
sault with a deadly weapon . and va
pxancy. Shaw attacked Xora Birch with
a knife in her rooms in a lodging house
at 316 Third street, and had it not been
for the timely interference of the land
lady he raicht have succeeded In ending
her life.
The Birch woman has been living with
Shaw for some time, but on Saturday last
Ehe had him arrested and booked on a
charge of "drunk."
Shaw was released yesterday morning
and he made several attempts during the
afternoon to see the woman. She took
refuge In the landlady's room, but Bhaw
forced the door open and drew a knife.
The landlady got between the cowardly
assailant and nls Intended victim, and
after making several ineffectual attempts
to stab her Shaw left the room and ran
down stairs. The landlady, who refused
to give her name, gave chase and fol
lowed the fleeing waiter to the corner of
Fourth and Harrison streets, where he
was knocked down by two citizens. A
tremendous throng gathered quickly, and
In the excitement Shaw escaped. lie ran
up Fourth street, closely pursued by sev
eral policemen and the crowd of citizens,
and turned down Folsom street toward
Third.
Half way down the block P. A. Parrish
stepped out and knocked Shaw down. Be
fore he could get up reinforcements ar
rived and Shaw was bundled Into an ex
press wagon and driven back to the scene
of his attempted crime, where he was
turned over to Policemen Drlscoll and Re
gan.
SOCIETY STAMPS
THE BAL MASQUE
US "ALL RIGHT"
?
An Active Request for
Invitations.
The demand for tickets clearly indicates
that the forthcoming Mardi Gras ball, un
der the. auspices of the San Francisco Art
Association, will be highly successful. Let
ters received at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art yesterday contained many ap
plications for tickets of admission. When
a ticket is Issued the name of the lady or
gentleman to whom it Is given Is entered
on a book. Reference to the book shows
that prominent leaders of local society
arc already largely represented in the field
of application. The officers of the asso
ciation frankly assert that society has
given its unqualified approval of the b*l
masque, and the names appearing on the
register of 150 Issued tickets corroborates
the assertion of the management.
The experience of the Art Association
of San Francisco In the field of ball-giving
has been varied, if not vast. The first
dancing function of the association was
given at the old rooms on Pine street dur
ing the adminlstnatlpn of Daniel Cook.
This initial entertainment was not a
Mardl Gras event, but simply an artistic
ball to which society was invited. The
management, however, resolved that beau
tiful decoration should be one of the fea
tures to delfght the assembled dancers,
and accordingly Virgil Williams, Jules
Tavernier and M". Garibaldi, artists of re
nown, were appointed to devise and exe
cute the scheme of decoration. The Dall
was appointed to take place on a Tuesday
evening. It came to the knowledge of the
decorating committee on the Sunday oven
ing immediately preceding the event that
not a single stroke of work had been done
in the decorating line, and not the semb
lance of a scheme of adornment for the
occasion had been suggested. When the
committee was sought it was found that
Virgil Williams had gone to his ranch on
Mount St. Helena, Tavernier was too bus
ily engaged in his work to be disturbed
and Garibaldi had- vanished. The whole
responsibility at once devolved on J. R.
Martin, assistant secretary of the assocJa
tion. Dan Cook, president of the associa
tion, an energetic and liberal man, toM
Martin to go ahead and decorate. Sign
painters, scenic artists and carpenters
were employed. Martin had authority
from Dan Cook to buy anything needed.
The work began Monday morning and was
not completed a minute before the lir^t
carriage arrived Tuesday night. The ball
was a great success from an artistic point
of view, but the receipts fell $400 short of
the expenses. A check to cover the de
ficiency was promptly given by President
Cook, hence the association emerged tri
umphant from the ordeal.
The Mardl Gras ball to be given on the
27th inst. will be the seventh in the his
tory of the association. The first was
given at the old rooms on Pine street.
Joseph D. Redding was then president.
The function was a pronounced success.
Society bestowed its sweetest smile on the
scheme. The decorations were beautiful
to behold and the company was delight
ful to entertain. Dowagers resplendent in
diamonds added splendor to the occasion.
The association gained money and fame
by the function. 'Â¦ "-
The second Mardl Gras ball was given
at the Grand Opera House, but the dow
agers were Bhy of the publicity and did
not give the affair the open commenda
tion which was bestowed on tho ball at
the rooms of the association. Tickets
were placed at $10 each. In a financial
sense the event was successful, but soci
ety was not charmed or captivated. The
next function of the kind was given at
Odd Fellows' Hall, and the result con
vinced the managers of the association
that the plan "of hiring outside halls
should be abandoned. Three successful
Mardi Gras events have taken place at
the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. The
forthcoming ball will be the second under
the administration of President Joseph D.
The work of decoration and equipment
for the next event is going forward speed
ily at the mansion of the association on
the hill. Captain Robert Howe Fletcher,
the curator of the institute, is giving to
the scheme of light and adornment per
sonal supervision. t
The new gallery will be used as a
throne room on the occasion of
the ball. There Prince Carnival and
his court will assemble. The decorations
will convey an Idea of court grandeur In
the display of heraldic devices, shields,
banners and standards. Palms In great
profusion from Santa Barbara are ex
pected to-day. All the boxes arranged for
have been*eold and there Is demand for
more spaces to view the carnival scenes.
To-day or to-morrow the managers of the
association will select some one to. fill
the responsible office of Prince Carnival.
There are several candidates for the
honor of leading the carnival.

MEDICINE DISPENSED
FREE AMONG CHINESE
SANITARIUM TO BE STARTED
FOR SICK HEATHEN.
Consul General Ho Vow Fathers a
1 Movement Which Will IÂ«essen
Suffering Among His
People.
For the first time in the history of San
Francisco a free medical dispensary will
be opened In Chinatown. The movement
to aid the sick and poor Chinese was
started by Consul General Ho Vow and
that gentleman contributed $1500 of his
own money to defray the initial expenses
of the Institution.
The necessity of a place where poor
Chinese might receive humane treatment
after disease had begun to gnaw at their
vitals became obvious when the horrible
and revolting exposure of tho "Chambers
of Tranquillity" was made by the police.
It was discovered that when the friend
less Chinese became infirm or unable to
work he was treated as an outcast and a
burden upon his people and promptly con
signed to an undertaker's bunk, where he
passed away from earth a short time
afterward and was quickly buried. No
iredlcal treatment whatever was accord
ed him and it was strongly suspected that
foreign agents were often employed to
assist disease in Its destruction of life.
Eight prominent physicians of the, city
have promised their assistance in con
ducting the new hospital, which will open
on Sacramonto street next week, and
prominent Chinese merchants will sub
scribe medicines, which will be given to
the needy free of charge. The idea is a
new one among the Chinese, but they have
welcomed it gladly and believe that it will
lessen a great deal of the misery and suf
fering which have heretofore existed in
the Chinese quarter.

JAMES B. STETSON AND
MRS. DOE ARE MARRIED
Ceremony Quietly Performed in the Presby
terian Church at Pasadena by Dr.
Mackenzie of This City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA. Feb. 19.â James B. Stet
son and Mrs. Eleanor H. Doe, who have
been sojourning In Los Angeles for some
time, were -quietly married at noon to
day In the Presbyterian Church by Rev.
Dr. Robert Mackenzie of San Francisco.
James B. Stetson is president of the
North Pacific Railway and the California
Street Cable Car Company, and a mem
ber of the big firm of Holbrook, Merrill
& Stetson. '-Â¦ ,v*-
Mrs. Eleanor H. Doe is the widow of
the millionaire lumberman John S. Doe.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie of the First Presby
terian Church accompanied the couple to
the charming southern town and there
made ' them man and. wife. -Â¦ None of the
members of Mr. Stetson's family wit
nessed the ceremony. The bride was ac
companied by her only child, a daughter,
ten years old. '
Although the announcement of the wed
ding of the millionaire and. the charming
widow came somewhat as a surprise, it
was not altogether unexpected. For more
than two years rumors of the engagement
have been current, and with Just the same
persistency as they regularly cropped up
were they regularly denied by Air. Stet
sons-- family.- Â¦ â¢
Announcement of the marriage yester
day was made by Mrs. Robert Oxnard, a
daughter of Mr. Stetson. "We knew that
my father was to be married to-day," she
said. "He and his bride will return here
to their home. 1801 Van Ness avenue, to
live. . Before they do, however, they will
visit New Orleans, make a tour of Flor-i
Ida and spend a short time In New
York." |
Mr. Stetson has three children, two
daughters, Mrs. Robert Oxnard and Mrs.
Chauncey "Winslow, and one eon, Harry
Stetson.
The lady who yesterday became Mrs.
Stetson, although well and prominently
known here, has lived a very retired life.
She is extremely wealthy and quite a
number of years younger than Mr. Stet
son. Since the death of Mr. Doe she spent
several years abroad, and after her return
and up to the present time she has made
h.er home at 2489 Jackson street.
The bride of J. B. Stetson is fully twen
ty-flve years his Junior. She is slender,
below medium stature and decidedly en
gaging In her looks, manners and conver-
cation. She Is about 37 years of age. The
estate of J. S. Doe. of which she and her
daughter are the heirs. Is quite extensive.
The St. Nicholas Hotel, land and struc
ture, the property nearly opposite occu
pied by Plum, the fine building and lots
at the corner of Taylor and Market
streets, and many other pieces of valuable
property, belong to the estate. The Doe
brothers, Bartlett and J. S.. were largely
Interested In prosperous corporations out
side of the lumber trade. It Is common
gossip that the bride of Mr. J. B. Stetson
Fs much richer in this world's goods than
he Is. Her holdings, however, so exten
sive and valuable, may require the per
sonal supervision of a trained and meth
odical man of business affairs. The bride
Is a lady of sufficient attraction, personal
and Intellectual, to win the comradeship
of a good man even If she did not possess
the prestige of wealth.
J. B. Stetson, while advanced in years,
has not attained the allotted span of three
score and ten. but is not many laps short
of it. . He rendered the city of San Fran
cisco most excÂ«llent service as chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors from 1579 until ISSI. If public
honors had possessed fcr him special at
traction he could easily have secured the
position of Mayor of San Francisco. Had i
he permitted the use of his name as a
candidate for higher honors than Mayor
he might have secured from the Republi
can State Convention that nominated H.
H. Markham the nomination for Gover
nor of California. Mr. Stetson Is a mem
mer of the Pacific Union Club, and at a
little dinner party three weeks ago made
the announcement of his' intended mar
riage to Mrs. Doe. Mr. Stetson is not a
club man in the common acceptation of
the term. On the contrary, he is ex
tremely fond of the comforts of a home.
Once at the Bohemian Club he loitered
until 3 o'clock, enjoying the mild revels
of a jinks. It was an unusually late hour
for him. "When he was about to get Into
bed a few minutes after 3 o'clock there
came a sharp shock of earthquake. This
tremor of the earth was accepted in the
household as a protest of nature against
late hours and high Jinks for Mr. Stet
son. The earth dirt not quake on the oc
casion of the wedding at Pasadena.
In business life Mr. Stetson is a hard,
earnest worker. He inherited character
istics of economy from his New England
ancestry and environment, and these
traits have not departed from him.
Judge said that he waa satisfied the shot
had been flred In the heat of passion, and
as the men had been strangers to each
other there was not that premeditation
which would constitute murder.

SHARK PREVENTS THE
RESCUE OF A SAILOR
The Bark Snow <5c Burgess Has an Eventful
Voyage From Australia to
This Port, friei ;.
THE American Bark Snow & Bur
gess arrived from Australia yee
terday morning after a fair pas
sage of seventy-three days. It
is many a day since a sailing
vessel came Into port In as perfect order
alow and aloft as is the Snow & Burgess.
On January 9 she passed the long-looked -
for A. G. Ropes in latitude 32 degrees IS
minutes north, longitude 127 degrees 2
minutes west. This vessel left New York
for San Francisco 206 days ago and the
underwriters were beginning to wonder
what had become of her. It waa known
that she put Into the Falkland Islands
with her rudder post twisted, and that
she sailed again on October 80, but noth
ing was heard from her after that until
the Snow & Burgess -brought the news of
her whereabouts.
Captain Olsen of the Snow & Burgess
reports that the A. O. Ropes came by the
way of the Cape of Good Hope and Aus
tralia. The two vessels were In company
for three days, and when the bark bore
down to within hailing distance the first
thing Captain Rivers asked was "Who
won the yacht race?" When the answer
"Columbia" went back across the waters,
the men on the Ropes gave three cheers
and a tiger. As near as Captain Olsen
could gather tho Ropes was caught off
the Horn in the October weather that
damaged so many vessels. Captain Riv
ers stated, that when he got into Port
Stanley he found twelve disabled vessels
there. It was impossible to get any re
pairs made in a hurry, so he fixed up the
rudder as well as he could and came on to
across the Pacific. The sailing- of both
vessels was cabled on the same day, but
the American did not sail until two days
after the Britisher, so in' reality the Snow
& Burgess beats the Calthness-shlre
twenty-four hours. The Snow & Burgess
has been away from the coast for nearly
a year. She loaded lumber, on Puget
Sound for South Africa and met with a"
number of mishaps before reaching Aus
tralia. While In the tropics a sailor named
O. Hansen fell overboard. He was a good
swimmer and had no trouble in keeping
himself afloat. A boat was lowered, but
when It was within ten yards of the sailor
a shark's fin appeared on the surface and
a few seconds later Hansen was dragged
under. A moment , later Â¦â¢ the water
showed red and the men in the boat knew
that all was over with their comrade. -
While entering Delagoa Bay the Snow
& Burgess struck heavily on the bar.
She was deeply laden and the captain of
the tug that had her in tow made a mis
calculation. In consequence nearly all the
copper on the vessel's bottom was sera pwl
off and she was strained a good. deal.
After discharging she went to Sydney, N.
S. W., in ballast, and on arriving there
went on the- drydock for repairs. After
receiving a thorough overhauling she weat
to Newcastle, N. S. . W., and loaded coal
for San Francisco.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Peru arrived from Panama and way ports
yesterday. She brought seven cabin,
twenty-one steerage and â¢ three Chinese
passengers.
The City of Para sailed for Mexican and
Central American ports yesterday." Among
the passengers were Dan M: Burns, wife
and daughter. . Â¦IDENTIFYING THE BOOKS.

The path of the millionaire seems not always to be

not fitted for tropical habitation any more than are

THE COST OF TROPICAL COLONIES.
ONLY a short time ago The Call had occasion to
direct attention to reports issued by the Statis
tical Bureau at Berlin, showing the unprofitable
nature of Germany's commercial relations" with her
imperial system of colonies. By the figures given it
appears that during the past year Germany imported
from her colonies goods to the value of 4,617,000
marks and exported goods and silver to the value of
10,149,000 marks, making a total trade for the year of
14,766,000 marks. To attain that trade, however, the
Government paid out of the imperial treasury in sub
sidie.s and bounties to the colonies and protectorates
during the same year the sum of 14,788,000 marks,
making a net loss of 22,000 marks for the operations
of the year.
Later reports on the same subject show the cost of
the German colonies in the tropics to be far greater
than appears in that commercial statement. In a
debate on the subject in the Reichstag last week it
was shown on official reports that famine and sick
ness in German East Africa had devastated that col
ony. In the district of Tanga, for example, within
the year 1890 the population has been diminished
from 123,308 to 61,328, owing to famine, leprosy,
smallpox and typhoid fever. The condition of the
whole colony appears appalling. The trade of this
colony, which is thrice the size of Germany, is mag
nificent, but mostly with British India, while the cost
to Germany is fivefold the whole trade. The reports
from the other colonies are not much better.
It is not surprising to learn the publication of such
statistics has set the Germans to reflecting upon the
profit and toss of tropical colonies. It is pointed out
by the Cologne Yolks Zeitung that the imperial rail
way projects for the colonies now adopted amount
t0 '200,000.000 marks, while, on the other hand, Ger
man trade with the British colonies amounts to 500,
000,000 marks, without entailing a cent of expense.

The Call has a long article on party re
organization to the general effect that the
only reorganization the party needs Is to
oust the old leaders and select new ones,
whose character and record shall Â¦be t a

bosses. Very good, but not quite enough.
What the party needs, above all things. Is
less centralization of organization. Let the
party committees of the several counties
run their own affairs, and let the State
committee be the product of these county
organizations, and it will not make much
difference what sort of leaders San 'Fran

GRAND JURY AND THE PERJURERS
GRAND JURIES have not in recent years per
formed a very notable or vigorous part in the
administration of law in San Francisco. Their
investigations have never been sufficient to do more
than alarm the more timid of wrongdoers, and their
reports, instead of being statements of actions taken,
have been explanations and apologies for the lack of
Over and over again juries have submitted reports
declaring a moral conviction of the existence of va
rious forms of crime and wrongdoing in the com
munity, but alleging an impossibility to obtain evi
dence that would lead to conviction in a court of law.
The present Grand Jury has better luck than its pre
deccisors. It has an opportunity to take steps toward
the prosecution of perjurers, and the evidence to con
vict is ready at hand. Simpton's affidavit that he,
while Justice of the Peace, married James G. Fair
and Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, on the one side, and his
counter affidavit that the first is false, make a clear
case so far as he it concerned. It appears the Grand
Jury has nothing to do but to indict in order to
bring about the conviction of that offender on his
own testimony.
In prosecutions of this kind it is inevitable that one
step sliaJl lead to another. The investigation of Simp
ton's offense will entail the investigation of other
offenses. Simpton claims he made his affidavit con
cerning the marriage for the purpose of trapping
Mrs. Craven, and asserts he was acting at the time
under the advice of his counsel, Sylva. Now Sylva
is an attorney indeed, but one who has been de
barred from the higher courts and forced to confine
his practice to Justice and Police courts. The fact
that tuch a man has been the counsel of Simpton does
not in any way add credibility or respectability to the
client. It serves no other purpose than that of show
ing the Grand Jury in what direction to push further
investigations.
Simpton lias stated that the Fair lawyers promise. 1
him protection from a prosecution for perjury, and
Sylva has stated that Mrs. Craven entered into a con
tract to pay him $30,000 to procure perjured testi
mony. Here are two other matters to which the
Grand Jury must give attention. By what privilege of
the bar do the attorneys in a case before the courts
assure perjurers of immunity from punishment for
the crime? How is it that an attorney, disbarred, it
is true, but still an attorney, has in his possession
written evidence of an attempt to obtain perjured tes
timony to be used in a suit before the courts, and yet
makes no effort to bring the guilty person to jus
tice?
To the general public it matters little which of the
contending parties in this case obtains possession of
the Fair millions. It is a matter, however, of grave
public concern that the subornation of perjury shall
be punished so thoroughly and so drastically that the
practice of it in our courts will be shunned by even
the boldest villains. To that end the prosecutions of
the admitted perjuries in this case should be carried
so far as to bring within the net of the law all the of
fenders who contrived, connived at, aided, abetted
or promised to protect the perjurer in the crime. Be
they rich or be they poor, they should be brought to
.answer in the courts they have attempted to degrad;,
and be judged by the justice they have sought to vio
late.
SETTLERS AND LEASES.
A MOVEMENT against the leasing of grazing
lands on the public domain has been started at
Prineville, Or. At a meeting held there a pro
test was framed, of which a copy has been sent
to The Call
We are entirely in sympathy with the declarations
and avowed purpose of the protest, and would de
cline to give any support to a measure which antag
onized them. The action of the meeting recites: "It
is apparent that under the provisions of the proposed
law leased public lands would be withdrawn from set
tlement, and the existing public land laws of the
United States would be nullified."
An examination of the Foster bill does not support
this statement. The first section of the bill says:
"That such of the vacant public lands, west of the
ninety-ninth meridian of longitude, west from
Greenwich, as, in the judgment of the Secretary' of
Agriculture, are more valuable for grazing than for
other uses, shall be subject to lease for grazing pur
poses." To enact that will not nullify any existing
law, for there is no law under which the arid grazing
lands may be acquired by the actual settler for farm
ing purposes, nor is there any under which such lands
can pass to private ownership in grazing "tracts. A
homesteader on arid lands is compelled by law to.
irrigate and reduce to tillage his tract within a fixed
time. Upon lands in the arid districts that are more
valuable for grazing than other purposes the home
steader cannot do this, for lack of water so placed
that it can be used for irrigation. The grazing lands,
therefore, are not valuable for any other purpose than
grazing, and as that is their sole value they are sub
ject to selection by the Secretary of Agriculture.
The people in the part of Oregon from which this pro
test comes have an object lesson before them. The river
Dcs Chutes country was once the most valuable graz
ing ground in the West. The bunch grass grew there
so luxuriantly that it was cut for hay. But the land
was commons. It was overstocked with cattle. The
forage was exhausted below the point of support for
cattle, and sheep followed, as they do everywhere
upon the appearance of such conditions.
An officer of the Agricultural Department, who has
personally inspected the Western ranges, says: "Ever
since the homestead act was passed in 1862 the agri
cultural settlement of the public lands has extended
rapidly westward, and as a result there now remains
scarcely any public land east of the one hundredth
meridian. West of that line, in the arid and sub
arid regions, the homestead act has proved only a
limited success, the extent of its success coinciding
with the extent of well-watered land in the vicinity
of springs, streams and lakes'. The settler could not
support himself on 160 acres of arid land, and in con
sequence these lands have remained unsettled. Under
the common law, and in the absence of special enact
ments to the contrary, public lands are commons, and
the settlers at once availed themselves of their com
mons rights by turning their stock out to graze on
the lands in question. So profitable was the result,
particularly with cattle, that it was not long before
large companies were formed and millions of cattle
occupied the vacant lands of the arid regions. The
natural grass crop that had previously gone to waste
was now transformed into national wealth. Finally,
however, the cattle became so numerous that there
was not grass enough to support them properly, and
the overgrazing of the arid region began. Then fol
lowed a pushing and crowding for grazing lands. The
sheep-owners crowded the cattle-owners by running
their sheep on the best range, and grazing an area so
closely that cattle had to be removed from the coun
try or starve. .The result of all this has. been bad
feeling, lawlessness and the destruction of life and
property."
We are sure that the people of the Prineville re
gion in Oregon will recognize the correctness of this
description. That part of Oregon is now being eaten
out by sheep, following the decline of the ranges by
overstocking with cattle. The sheep will soon finish
what is left, and will follow up the retreating cattle
upon other ranges, until the destruction of the forage
on the arid grazing lands will be complete. If the Print
ville protest is sincere, if it is really in the interest of
the actual settler, it raises an issue that cannot be
properly made against the Foster bill. If it uses the
settler merely as a pretext for continuing things as
they have been on the ranges, it is not worthy of
attention.
The number of cattle in Wyoming declined 50 per
cent and in value $15,632,204 in twelve years, under
the existing system, and the same record applies to
the whole arid grazing region.
If these lands that cannot be homesteaded, that are
not susceptible of agricultural settlement and are of no
value for other purpose than grazing, are not pro
tected and recuperated by a leasehold policy now, in
a short time they will have no value for anything,' and
the beef supply of the country will injuriously and ir
reparably decline.
To these considerations we. invite the attention of
the protesting people of Prinevillc, and of all interests
in the arid grazing regions.

THE CANAL TREATIES
THE ratifications of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
were exchanged on July 4, 1850. The acquisi
tion of California and the extension of our Pa
cific Coast line had brought into prominence the
necessity of a ship canal across the isthmus. John
M. Clayton, Secretary of State, was named by the
Taylor administration to negotiate with Grtat Britain
"a convention relative to a ship canal by way uf
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito coast or any
part of Central America." In the negotiation Great
Britain was represented by Sir Henry Lytton-Bulwer.'
The ratifications were exchanged six days before Mil
lard Fillmore became President by the death of Tay
lor. The- treaty provides that: "The Governments of
the United States and Great Britain hereby declare
that neither the one nor the other will ever obtain or
maintain for itself any exclusive control over the said
ship canal, agreeing that neither will ever erect or
maintain any fortification commanding the same, or
in the vicinity thereof, or occupy, or fortify, or colo
nize, or assume or exercise any dominion over
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito coast or any
part of Central America."
It was further agreed that when such ship canal is
constructed the United States and Great Britain "will
guarantee the neutrality thereof." We believe there is
no evidence that that treaty has ever been abrogated,
either affirmatively or by implication. It was desired
by the United States, because Great Britain was at
that time the only nation that could expect to succeed
in constructing a canal across the isthmus. Not long
after it was made some steps were taken by our Gov
ernment preliminary to construction. Lieutenant
Strain was sent to make a survey, and accomplished
an exploration, with many interesting adventures.
At the close of President Arthur's administration a
treaty was made by Secretary Frelinghuysen between
the United States and the Governments of Costa
Rica and Nicaragua, which gave to us sovereignty
and dominion of the canal line. Such abandonment
of their own sovereignty, however, was not made by
those Governments without a price. They exacted
that the United States should at all times defend and
maintain their territorial integrity!
This treaty of course violated the Clayton -Bulwer
convention, for it assumed dominion. President
Cleveland withdrew it from the Senate immediately
after his inauguration in 1885, and in his first regular
message referred to it in these terms: "I am unable
to recommend propositions involving paramount
privileges of ownership or right outside of our own
territory, when coupled with absolute and unlimited
engagements to defend the territorial integrity of the
state where such interests lie. * * * The lapse of
years has abundantly confirmed the wisdom and fore
sight of those earlier administrations which, long be
fore the conditions of maritime intercourse were
changed and enlarged by the progress of the age, pro
claimed the vital need of interoceanic transit across
the American isthmus and consecrated it in advance
to the common use of mankind by their positive
declarations, and through the formal obligations of
treaties." In this he undoubtedly recognized the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty as in force, and the Freling
huysen treaty as in violation of it. In his message,
arguing the necessity of a neutral canal, he quotes
Cass in 1858: "What the United States want in Cen
tral America, next to the happiness of its people, is
the security and neutrality of the interoceanic routes
which lead through it."
The whole record of the subject reveals this desire
for a neutrality which cannot exist over a fortified
waterway.
The nation must regard honorably its treaty obli
gations, and that those assumed in the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty still exist seems indisputable. But sup
pose they do not. Even then we cannot fortify the
canal, and establish over it a garrison police, and a
military patrol of Lake Nicaragua or Managua, .with
out the consent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. They
are in the family of nations, and, being jealous of
their sovereignty, will not surrender it without an
equivalent.
Are the opponents of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
prepared to support such a convention as the Freling
huysen treaty, by which we assume the responsibility
of their military defense against all comers, and re
serve no ripht to limit or control the cause of quar
rels in' which they may engage? It is readily seen
that, assured of defense by the United States, they
have nothing to lose by truculence and recklessness,
and their broils would never end, nor would the ex
pense of their defense in every quarrel, furnished at
our cost.
This Government can abrogate the treaty with
England, and it is probable, as has been said in Lon
don, that England would not object, but the dangers,
difficulties and cost come after such action. Who is
willing to take the responsibility of assuming them?
SERPENTINE BOAT TO
BREAK OCEAN RECORD
Craft to Run JLike a Screw, and Is Expected
to Go a Mile a Minute and Cross the
Atlantic in Three Days.
JAMES GRESHAM of Brooklyn Is preparing: to build the first of his serpentine
boats for the syndicate headed by W. J. ArkelL
Â¦It Is expected that this type of boat will cross the ocean In less than three
days, drlvlnjj Itself like a screw through the water at the rate of sixty miles
an hour, and It Is the Intention of the syndicate to try to procure the contract
for carrying the trans-AtlantJc malls. Mr. Gresham Believes his boat, which Is to
be built at Newport News, will be ready for her trial spin In about six months.
The Gresham boat will probably be the strangest looking craft that ever sailed
the seas. It will look more like a sea serpent than anything else, with a body
like an elongated Rugby football and a prow and stern curving up Into the air
like the ends of an ancient galley. Around the body will be the big spiral fianga
which Is to give to It Its forward motion as the outer shell of the ship revolves
rapidly.
HOW THE QUEER CRAFT WILL BE BUILT.
The boat will consist of two sections, one within the other. The "Inner shell
will be shaped like a cigar, round in the middle and tapering to a point at each
end. A round tube will extend from It fore and aft, turning upwartt and outward
like a swan's neck. It will terminate in an open mouth, which wlll.be the venti
lator of the ship. Around the neck will be a gallery. This will be the deck of
tho ship, the only open place in the whole vessel. The after gallery will be used
for the wheelhouse and the forward balcony for the bridge.
This inner hull will be swung like a hammock In the outer shell, which com
pletely envelops It, letting only the bow and stern protrude. It rests on ball
bearings, which, Mr. Gresham says, reduce the friction to almost nothing.
All the machinery is stowed In the bottom of the inner hull, so as to balance
It and keep it stationary. Penetrating the lower section of the hull is a revolv
ing shaft, which Is geared to the outer hull. By revolving this shaft the outer
ehell is spun around the inner hull.
Around the outer hull is wound the great steel flange, which Is thÂ© main prin
ciple of the device.
HOW IT WILL GET ITS GREAT SPEED.
"This Is the great Archimedean screw," said Mr. Gresham to me yesterday.
"Archimedes said that If he had room for a fulcrum he could lift the earth.
Well, in this case we make the water our fulcrum. The hull of the boat, oper
ated from within, revolves, and the. flange drives the vessel forward. I should
say that the speed of such a boat is limited only by the strength of the material
used In Its construction.
. "The boat we Intend to build will be BO feet long, 11 feet in diameter in the
middle, will weight about 11V& tons, and have a displacement of less than four
tons. It will be built of fine steel, and the flange will be 11 Inches wide at Its
widest part.
"Three revolutions would drive the boat Its own length. We would probably
run her at one hundred revolutions a minute, although I believe we could make
four hundred turns. But at one hundred she would be making a speed of sixty
miles an hour and would cross the Atlantic In less than three days."
Mr. Gresham will not disclose the nature of the power he win use in turning;
the vessel. He says It is a secret power of his own discovery.â New York Herald.

KEPNER IDENTIFIES
ADAMS IN THE HOSPITAL
Arrested Man Says He Was Attacked
and Shooting Was Entirely
Accidental.
Gilbert Adams, the barber who shot his
employer, E. S. Kepner, at 44 O'Farrell
street Sunday afternoon and was arrest
ed at Santa Clara that night, was brought
bacK by Detective P. Sullivan yesterday
afternoon. He was at once taken to thÂ©
Receiving Hospital by Sullivan and De
tective Reynolds, and when Kepner saw
him h<Â» paid: "That's the man that shot
me."
Adams was then taken before Chief
Sullivan and made practically the same
statement as was published yesterday
morning. He claimed that Kepner struck
him first and was on top of him when he
pulled tho revolver out of his pocket and
It accidentally exploded. He denied em
phatically that Kepner's wife had any
thing to do with their quarrel, and said
that he had only spoken to her four times
all the time he lived in the house. He was
locked up in "the tanks" pending the re
sult of Kepner's injuries:
Kepner was resting easily yesterday,
and the doctors think there Is a good
chance for his recovery. The Internal
hemorrhage seems to. have stopped.
CHIEF SULLIVAN
STRIKES IT THE
"UPPER OFFICE"
Announces Several
Changes.
HEAD CLERK IS APPOINTED
SERGEANT FRANK H. NORMAN
THE LUCKY MAN.
Sergeant Colby Made Register Clerk
in the Property Clerk's Office
and Sergeant Fitzhenry
Complaint Clerk.
Chief of Police Sullivan Is rapidly
familiarizing himself with the duties of
his office and his quiet investigations with
in the past few days have led him to make
certain changes which he announced yes
terday afternoon. The moot prominent
is the appointment of Sergeant Frank H.
Norman, to be clerk to the Chief, which
entitles him to a salary of $200 per month.
Norman has been in the "upper" offlce for
some years and is a most capable and
courteous officer. VThen Clerk Wright re
tired on a pension, prior to the new year,
Norman was temporarily placed in the
position, but later was transferred to the
general offlce as complaint clerk, a posi
tion occupied by Sergeant H. 11. Colby
for a number of years. .Colby became
clerk to the Chief.
The position of complaint clerk In the
"upper office has been given to Sergeant
John T. Fltzhenry, the "sweet singer" of
the department, and an efficient officer,
and Colby has been assigned to the posi
tion of register clerk In tha property
clerk's offlce.
Sergeant Reuben "Wolf, who has for two
or three years been assigned to duty In
the City Prison, has been ordered to re
port to Captain Splllane for duty as pa
trol sergeant, and Policeman C. Donohoe,
RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.

Xoteâ These papers on Practical Science have been prepared for The Call's Home Study
Circle by Professor William J. Hopkins of Drexel Institute.
Army Inspector Tests the Workings of the Disappearing Carriages.
weighs more than thirty, tons, and
when it is discharged the carriage
should be so well balanced that the re
coil will bring the gun down gently to
the loading position without damaging
the mechanism and always Just far
enough to allow It to be locked In place
until another charge has been driven
home and the gun is ready for another
shot. It Is evident that a great deal
of the efficiency of the carriage de
pends upon the way the gun is bal
anced and the manner in which the re
coil mechanism performs its duties.
The best results can only be obtained
after the theoretical calculations , are
supplemented by actual firing. The
guns tested yesterday fulfilled every
expectation.
With the mortars the problem is not
so difficult. The mortar is not mount
ed on a disappearing carriage, and the
only duty the carriage has to perform
is to stand the shock of the discharge
and absorb the recoil. The backward
kick of the gun is taken up by hy-
draullc cylinders, and when the gun
has reached the limit of Its backward
travel it is returned to its place by
hydraulic pressure. There is no neces
sity for balancing it, and its loading:
position is also its firing position. "With
the disappearing: mechanism the grun Is
loaded down on the carriage; It Is
raised above the parapet by hydraulic
pressure, and the shock of the recoil,
when the carriage works properly,
brings it down on the carriage just far
enough to allow it to lock itself until
it can be loaded again.
There are guns enough now In the
works on the Presidio hills to stop
anything that may try to float into
the harbor. All of the ten-Inchâ and
there are fifteen or sixteen of themâ
and two of the twelve-inch guns are on
disappearing carriages. There are
more twelve-inchers mounted above
the parapet, and in addition are sixty
four mortars and three of the largest
dynamite guns made.

THE puns In the works above
Fort Point were tested yester
day by Captain C. H. Clark of
the Benicla Arsenal. There are
emplaced a number of. the new ten
inch rifles mounted on disappearing
carriages that have never been given
an actual trial, and It was the desire of
the department that ali of these should
be tried under a service charge. The
mortar batteries also have not been
thoroughly tested, nor were they thor
oughly tested yesterday morning, but a
shot from one mortar in each pit was
taken. There are four pits with six
teen mortars in each.
The test was not 6o much a trial of
the guns as it was of the carriages.
The guns have all been thoroughly
tested at the proving grounds and
there is no doubt of their ability to
stand any strain the service may put
upon them, but with the carriages it
is another matter. A "disappearing"
carriage is almost as delicately bal
anced as a gold scale. Each gun

Trustees Sell Smiths' Cash Store.
A long meeting of the trustees for the
creditors of Smiths' Cash Store was held
yesterday in the rooms of the Board of
Trade. The outcome of the deliberations
was announced later by Trustee T. J. Par
sons. He said that the trustees had sold
the store to Harvey H. Dana, the presi
dent of the Dana power plant. He would
not say what sum was paid nor give any
statement concerning the future of the
business, saying that Mr. Dana might be
prepared to | make a statement on that
point to-morrow. The committee of nine
appointed at the recent meeting of the
creditors of Smiths' Cash Store will meet
to-day and . the trustees will then report
to them what has been done. This news
will surprise the creditors, for the meet-
Ing was concluded only late in the after
noon. Mr. Dana will take charge of the
business to-day. The trustees , wero in
charge yesterday. They are T.J. Par
sons, S. Nickelsberg and M. Schweitzer.
1. UQUID AIR.
The "Permanent Oases."
But a short generation ago, as genera
tions are usually reckoned, men still spoke
with some confidence of the "permanent
gases." This term, when it was Intro
duced, meant those substances which oc
curred only in the stage of gas. such as
oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, and which
it was originally thought could not possi
bly be made to become liquid or solid.
As interest In the matter grew and suc
cessive experiments, scattered, perhaps,
over long intervals of years, accomplished
the change for one gas after another, the
list of the so-called "permanent gases
grew smaller and smaller, until there re
mained but the three. These successfully
resisted all efforts to liquefy them, al
though It was generally recognised by the
most advanced scientific men that there
was needed only a greater perfection in
method to change them also, and that
every substance, under appropriate condi
tions, would assume the solid or the liquid
or the gaseous state. "Permanent" gas
had then come to mean only a gas which
was very difficult to liquery. The term,
however, has now no 'meaning, for ther*
is no known gas which has not been con
verted into liquid.
Early Experiments.
The first important step in thi3 line of
work may be said to be marked by Fara
day's liquefaction of chlorine gas. Some
few experiments before this seemed to
have some measure of success, but they
were isolated and in most cases doubtful.
In 1823, however, Faraday, who was then
Sir Humphry Davy's assistant In tha
Royal Institution, tried an experiment, at
Davy's suggestion, which had important
and unexpected results. In a closed tube
of thick glass he heated a substance
which produced chlorine gas. Davy was
not present, but Dr. Parts, a friend mt
Davy, happened to be. The anecdote has
been often told, but it is worth repeating
here.
Both Davy and Dr. Paris were to dine
out. and the doctor, . finding himself
dressed, with time to spare, dropped In at
the laboratory of the Royal Institution,
where Faraday, the assistant, had been
left to work. He found Faraday heating
something in a tube, and glancing at it
he rallied the experimenter on using un
clean vessels, calling his attention to an
oily substance in the tube. Faraday
looked, acknowledged the Justice of the
remarks and' Immediately proceeded to
file off the end of the tube. Immediately,
to the surprise of both, there was a vio
lent explosion and the oil vanished.
Dr. Paris went off to his dinner and
Faraday went on with his work, and on
the following day the doctor, was sur
prised to receive this note: "Dear Sin
The oil you noticed yesterday turns out
to be liquid chlorine. Yours faithfully.
M. Faraday."
This was the beginning, and It was not
lone before Faraday and Davy had suc
ceeded in converting to the liquid form
several gases. Including ammonia, nitrous
oxideâ the "laughing gas" of to-day-'-and
carbon dioxide, or "carbonic add gas."
This carbon dioxide is a gas of tha most
common occurrence. It is produced by
respiration and by combustion of any
kindâ respiration is but one form of com
bustion â and la a constituent of atmos
pheric air in pretty definite and constant
Eroportioris. The balance Is maintained
y the action of plants, which break It
up. digest the carbon and set free the
oxygen again. Carbon dioxide proved to
be comparatively easy to liquefy and even
to solidify, and was for many years Im
portant in work of this kind, being used
in the liquid or the solid form to produce
low temperatures.
There came now a break of many years
in Faraday's work upon gases, and In this
interval the name tbat stands out most
prominently is probably that of Thllorier.
He succeeded. in producing liquid carbon
dioxide in large quantities and in solidi
fying it at 100 degrees below zero centi
grade without compression. This solid
moistened with ordinary ether is known
as "Thllorler's mixture," and will pro-
duce a temperature of 110 degrees below
zero centigrade, or 166 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit. Some unsuccessful attempts
were made to liquefy hydrogen and oxy
gen by pressure alone. We should know
now that such attempts could not possi
bly succeed.
In 1545 Faraday, stimulated by the work
of Thllorier, began again to experiment
upon gases. He succeeded in liquefying
manyâ their names would be familiar
only to the chemistâ and In solidifying
some of them. The liquids were, as a
rule, transparent and colorless and the
solids crystalline, transparent or trans
lucent. He was not. successful In lique
fying the "permanent" gases, bat he pre
dicted that if a low enough temperature
could be produced they would pass Into
the liquid or the solid state, and he hoped
to see oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen,
"either as liquid or solid bodies, and tho
latter probably as a metal." This last
has proved not to be the case, for tha
solid hydrogen Is distinctly non-metallic,
according to the statements of the exper
imenters who have obtained it.
Others were working at the same prob
lem, but none of them succeeded in solv
ing it, although Natterer produced In his
apparatus the enormous pressure of 3COO
atmospheresâ about 54,000 pounds to tha
square inch.
The Passing of the "Permanent Gas."
At the meeting of the French Academy
on December 24, 1877. two communications
were read. One was from Cailletet. and
had been In the care of a member of tha
academy for three weeks. In It Cailletet
wrote, under the date of December 2,
1877: "I have to tell you first, without
losing a moment, tbat 1 have to-day lique
fied oxygen. â¢ â¢ â¢" He seemed to feel
some hesitation In making so broad a
statement, for he had produced only "a 
mist so dense" that he "inferred the pres
ence of a vapor very near its point of
liquefaction;" and he was anxious to bÂ«
able to "see oxygen flow."
The other communication was a tele
gram from Plctet. at Geneva, dated De
cember 22, 1377: "To-day I liquefied oxy
gen at a pressure of 320 atmospheres and
a temperature of 140 degrees (centigrade)
â¢ â¢ â¢ At higher pressures Plctet suc
ceeded In obtaining an actual Jet of un
mistakably liquid oxygen, the liquid jet
surrounded by a mist of particles, prob
ably solid oxygen.
Greater successes followed quickly.
Cailletet soon produced liquid nitrogen â
only a - few drops, which remained but
three seconds; then liquid air, and finally
hydrogen In the form of a mist. Plctet
obtained hydrogen partially liquid and
probably partly solid. The "permanent"
gases were no more. All known gases
had at last been liquefied, although the
liquid obtained from the most refractory
had cost much more than its weight In
diamonds. More than half a century had
been spent In the slow evolution of effi
cient apparatus and much effort wasted
In futile methods of attack. The result
would probably have been reached some
years earlier If one property of gases,
which was not clearly set forth until late
In the '60s. had been understood at the
beginning. This Is the "critical tempera
ture" â a particular temperature for each
gas above which *no pressure, however
great, can convert the gas to liquid. That
some such condition must be fulfilled was
vaguely appreciated by the greater minds,
but It remained for Andrews to elucidate
the whole matter.
One more thing was to be dona before
the process of liquefaction of gases was
established on a satisfactory basis. Some
method must be perfected by which lique
fied gas could be produced in quantity at
a reasonable cost. This was accomplished
In the so-called "regenerative method," or
method of cumulative effect, in which no
cooling substance Is used except the gas
Itself. The principle Involved was al
ready thoroughly understood and had
formed a part of the process employed
by nearly everr successful experimenter,
but Its possibilities, aa applied to this
purpose, had not been appreciated.

PAY ON LEAVE
FOR CONTRACT
ARMY SURGEONS
One Result of Their
Organization.
BIG CONCESSION . SECURED
CONTRACTS BEING ANNTTLLED
AND NEW ONES ISSUED. '
?
Clause Placing Hired Doctors Nearly
on the Plane of Army Sur
geonsâChaplain Pierce
VV;-^; fo? the Presidio.
The organization of the acting assistant
surgeons of the army has borne fruit. Un
der a recent order from the 'surgeon gen
eral contracts are being annulled and new
ones are being Issued, and In the new ones
is Incorporated one of the things the act
ing assistant surgeons organized to se
cure. The new contracts allow contract
surgeons' pay during authorized absences.
When the acting assistant surgeons or
ganized in New York some months ago,
one of the grievances they set out to right
was the withholding of pay from contract
surgeons whenever, for any reason, they
were absent from duty. When a contract
surgeon became sick he was sent to the
military hospital, where he received good
care, but was charged a dollar a day for
his board. An officer Is not allowed
rations. He must keep himself. Acting
assistant surgeons are not commissioned,
but to the extent of paying board they
were considered officers. In the mean
time, while they were paying their dollar
a day,- their pay 'was stopped.
In the new contracts it is provided that
during leaves a contract surgeon shall re
ceive full pay. Contract surgeons are not
given vacations. They are hired at a time
when vacations for military men are at a
discount, and the only leave probable for
them is a uick leave.
Colonel Forwood, chief surgeon of the
department, is. calling in all the acting as
sistant surgeons In charge of transports,
and Is canceling their old contracts and
issuing new ones to them. It is a distinct
step forward in the position of the con
tract surgeons.
It is evident that some arrangement has
been arrived at between the surgeon gen
eral and the Auditor of the Treasury. Ha
It was who first refused to pay acting as
sistant surgeons when they were sick, on
the ground that their contracts called for
pay only for the time they were at work.
As to the legality/ of altering the contract
he was directly. silent, and it Is probable
the matter has been fixed up in some
shape that will* meet the scruples of the
.treasury auditor. and help the acting as
sistant surgeon out of the financial di
lemma that was vexing him.
Â¦ It is understood 1 at the Presidio that
Chaplain Pierce, the army chaplain who
came liom Manila with the body of Gen
eral Lawton and accompanied It East
will , be assigned to duty at the Presidio
to take the place made vacant by thÂ« re
tirement of Chaplain Macomber. Chaplain
Pierce is well known In army circles on
this coast. -
Acting Assistant Surgeon Aubray F
Higgins has been assigned to duty at the
General Hospital. Major George "W.
Ruthers, commissary of subsistence, has
received a telegram from Senator Talia
ferro of ; Florida, which exonerates him'
from all blame charged against him as
the i outgrowth of the condemnation of a
lot of bad bacon while the troops were at
Tampa in the spring of 189 S. It can be
shown that Major Ruthers . was not In
Jacksonville, where the condemnation
took place, at the ' tima it was said he
made a corrupt contract for the sale of
the condemned bacon. ? Tho charges werÂ«
made by a service , detective .named Hoi- i
land. Hq is now being prosecuted for libels
who has for a few days been one of the
bailiffs in Judge Cabaniss* court, will re
port for duty to Captain Seymour in tho
prison. Policeman John Fleming, who
was through a misunderstanding removed
from the position of bailiff in Judge Ca
baniss' court, will report again for the
same duty. Policeman Arthur McQualde
has been transferred from the property
clerk's office to Captain Spillane's division
for patrol duty. Sergeant John Duncan
has been relieved from night duty In the
ofllce of the Chief, and will report to
Lieutenant Esola for duty as desk ser
geant.
The Chief intimated yesterday that
other changes would be made whenever
he considers that the department would
be benefited by them.
The Chief met the men of Company A
In the assembly room at the Central sta
tion at 5 o'clock in the afternoon with the
object of making himself known to them.
He briefly addressed them, urging them
to see that the rules and laws were en
forced, and he would always be their
friend. He praised them for their effi
ciency, and said that he intended to make
the department the most efficient on the
continent.
TWENTY LESSONS IN FRENCH CONVERSATION.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
Note â These lessons have been prepared for T*e Call's Home Study Circle by Professor
Benno Kirschbaum of Philadelphia. They are intended primarily for Americans who pur
pose attending the Paris Exposition. The lessens win lncluds (1). common French words
and phrases, (2) easy conversation and (3) simple readinr lessons.
PREMIERE !LECON. PRTJH-MYAIR
LE-SONG.
LESSON NO. 1.
Hints on Pronunciation.
1. The student will note at the outset
that there are sounds in the French Inn
guage for which there are no equivalents
in English. These can be represented by
means of English sounds, but very unsat
isfactorily.
2. The following are essentially French
sounds. They are nasalâ that Is, they
sound through the nose: am, an, em and
en are pronounced like aun in aunt; aim.
eln, lm, in and ym are pronounced very
much like an in anxious; lan and len
sound like e-yon, viz., nance>; om and on
when not followed by another m are
sounded like on in long; eun, urn and un
have the sound of un in lung. â¢ i
3. The above sounds may be Imitated i
more strongly by saying ang. ohng. ong
and ung. if the final derinite sound of g
is omitted and the nasal given. The nn?:\l
may be considered as a vowel with a
strangulated n after it, sounded at the
"top" of the nose.
4. Final consonants are generally miUe
In French.
5. The c (accented from right to left) has
the sound of ay In hay. and the c (accent
ed from the left to the right) the sound of
c in where. The final o (unaccented) his
no sound at all, while the c in the middle
of a word or syllable has the sound of v
in but.
6. Note well that all final consonants
are mute, except when followed by a word
commencing with a vowel, then the sound
of that consonant is usually blended with
that vowel. For Instance, vousâ avezâ ecrit
Is pronounced voo-za-vay zay-kree (you
have written). Such blending will be
marked throughout the lessons with a
small arch (.-) to connect the two
words.
7. Additional hints will be given In intro
ducing subsequent lessons.

The beginner is advised to learn theso
phrases tnoroughly. A small French-Eng
lish dictionary will help In interpreting 1
the literal meanings. Oo your best with
the pronunciation. You cannot get it per
fect. If you lived In Paris twenty years
your trench pronunciation would . still
stamp you as either English or American.
But you can make yourself understood
just as a Frenchman makes himself un
derstood in talking Kngltsh.
Easy Reading Exercise.
The reading lessons will supplement UiÂ«
conversational exercises. They will aid in.
making- students familiar with French
words in printed form and will also afford
excellent practice in pronunciation. The
student is expected to translate the exer
cise into English. A great many of the
words and phrases have already been
used In the conversational phrase 9.

New York Stock Market.
NEVT YORK. Feb. 19.â The outside public
Â¦till refused to manifest any Interest in the
stock market to-day and operations continued
wholly In the hands of professional traders.
This element made an attempt to force a con
tinuance of last week's reaction, using as their
mÂ«ln argument the drain being made upon the
rash resources of the banks. To-day's state
ment of sub-treasury operations showed a loss
already hlnce Friday to that institution of
J1. 421.000. This showing helped the bears In
an .early raid on the market which wiped out
the opening gains and carried prices generally
below Saturday's closing level. One or two
stocks suffered from individual causes and
helped on the reaction. Pacific Mall, Peo
ple's Gas and Third Avenue showed continued
weakness and Pennsylvania was depressed on
rejxirts of a new car trust involving many
million dollars. The bears did not succeed in
) iringing out any large offerings and were
driven to cover on the development of aggres
sive strength la several stocks. Including
Â£ugar. Kuhber. Chicago. Indianapolis and
Louisville. Tobareo. General Electric, Lacka
trar.na and Third Avenue. The most potent
factor in the rally was the large Increase In
earnings for the second week In February
ehown by a number of railroads. Norfolk and
Western made the most rtriklng exhibit with
an increase over the corresponding period of
last >Â¦â¢Â¦*!Â¦ of 3133.538, which is nearly 96 per
cent. This resulted in a large absorption of
etock at an extreme advance of 2% and had
m. sympathetic effect on all the bituminous
coal carrying roa<?s contributing to the rally
In Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio. To
ledo and Ohio Central showed an Increase in
earnings of 73 per cent over the second week In
February. The evidences of the large demand
for bituminous coal were coupled with reports
of Increasing use of anthracite In steam pro
duction because of dlSculty In obtaining soft
coal. The anthraolte group shewed the effect
of this influence and of published forecasts of
the anr.ual statement of Lackawanna which
Is to be issued to-morrow. Intimating a
high percentage of earning* lor the year. In
addition Ontario and Western showed an In
crease of 44 per cent in earnings for the week.
In the Southern croup Louisville and Nashville
made a showing for the week â¢which was 54
per cent better than that of last year, the in
crease in gross amounting to $18C.!45. All the
returns received show striking gains, though
those enumerated are the largest. The cotton
carrying roads especially Ehowed recovery from
the recent low level of -earnings And were ad
vanced in price in consequence. The tonic
effect of these extraordinary earnings proved
too much for the bears and they were forced
to cover. The continued ease of call money,
which ranged from 2 to 2% per cent, neutral
ized the alarmist view of the money market
outlook. Borne slight effect was produced also
*Â¦>Â¦ the reports of further British successes In
South Africa. Erie Telephone rose buoyantly
some 8 point*. Dealings were not on a large
neale and the market fell dull before the close
but held quite firm near the top.
Business in bonds showed aome falling off
In volume and price changes were mixed. Total
eales, par value, J1.t55.000.
United States old 4s and 6s advanced M and

salted hides continue dull and stocks are accu
mulating. Few sales are reported, although
dealers are willing to make concessions to move
Hides. This condition can be expected until the
tanners have reduced the number of hides they
have now on hand.
"Dry Hides and Calf Skins are In better de
mand than salted stock, being free from grubs
and in good condition. They sell readily at
prices quoted.
"There is a fair demand and a steady market
for Horse Hides.
"Large quantities of Deerskins come to the
market from the North and Northwest and
Mexico. . The demand Is active, with prospects
for a well sustained tnnrket.

CHICAGO. Feb. 19.â Corn sold to a standstill
without weakening, reacted on change by
shorts to-day and closed strong, May %o over
Saturday. May corn opened a shade under
Saturday at 34 V t i 3<Sf , attributable to j the
easiness of wheat. There waa no great de
mand, but offerings were absorbed readily and
May clung for hours around 34% c. Near the
close offerings became very scarce under heavy
buying to cover, and May Hhot up from 34% c
to 35%Â©-35% c, at which the market closed â %c
over Saturday. The strength developed by
wheat late in the session was attributable to
the bulge In the coarse cereal. The opening
was easy and Liverpool decltned on the In
creaÂ«; In wheat and flour on passage. May
'ift'Hc under Saturday at 67% c. The advance
In Paris and the unfavorable weather reported
In France created a diversion In favor of the
bulls which pulled tne price up to fiS'nc. Trade
was dull, however, and a little profit-taking
sent May back to Initial figures. Shbrts cov
ered and May advanced to 6S%@6S%c, at which
It closed, He over Saturday.
A long line of oats was let out to-day which
was largely influential in holding that market
easy. The trade was not large. May closed a
shade up at 23%<@'23%e.
Provisions held their own the greater part
of the day because hog receipts were under
the estimate and turned firm with corn at the
close. Trade was not large and fluctuations
were narrow. May pork closed "V><s?lOc over

HeirS Object to Payment
;Â¦ of a Note.
Special Dispatch to The -Call.
WOODLAND, Feb. 19. â There is a pros
pect of a big legal battle over the estate
of George Washington Johns. He died in
May of last year, leaving quite an estate,
the bulk of which consisted of property
in Colusa County. ; , Â¦ '
When the will was published it was dis
covered that it made no provision for
George W. or Mary Gregory, two grand
children. Later a claim was presented to
the executors for $10,000, based upon a
promissory note dated July 7, IS9B. pur
porting to be executed by the deceased
and made payable jointly, to George W.
and Mary Gregory.
For a time there were many rumors of a
contest, and some of the relatives openly
charged that the note was a forgery. The
executors, however, allowed the claim
and the court confirmed their action.
The hearing of their account came up In
the Superior Court this morning, and
Tardy Allen, a grandson, and Polly Ann
Friel, a daughter of the deceased, filed an
objection. While It does not declare that
the note Is a forgery. It alleges that it Is
not a claim against the estate, and inti
mates that It was never executed by the
defendant. The matter will be heard next
Monday.
NIUSTGET TITLE
FROM STATE OR
PRIVATE OWNERS
Legal Opinio^pn West
Oakland Uock.
\ Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Feb. 19.
The city of Oakland cannot build
wharves on the west side of its water
frontage without recognizing the title of
either the State or private holders. Such
Is the obstacle in the way of any Immedl
: ate realization of the project to construct
a dock, contemplated In the proposed
bond Issue. '
. City Attorney Dnw has furnished to the
Board of Public Works a report concern-
Ing the titles to the lands necessary to be
taken. He finds that the decision of the
Supreme - Court In the water front case
vests the ownership to lands between
bulkhead and pierhead lines south of
Twenty-second street In the State. North
to the city line the lands are not Included
In the decision, but Attorney Dow says:
"It Is generally conceded that these lands
are held In private ownership by grantees
of the State."
Oakland cannot acquire the use of the
State' 9 holdings except by an act of tha
Legislature, nor of the private posses
sions unless by- purchase or condemna
tion.
The report was made upon a request by
the City Council, which had under con
sideration the wharf proposition. City
Attorney Dow shows only the method of
procedure which must be followed in case
the wharf plan shall be Included In the
bond issue. This question Is among those
which have been submitted to the dti
tens' committee of one hundred for con
sideration.
ARMY'S DEFECTS

V/ASHINGTON. Feb. 19â The Secretary
<.Â¦* War. has .sent to the chairman of' .the

Tne bill" -\* as introduced in the House
to-day by Chairman Hull. A chief feat
i.:e of., tne legislation .asked for provides
! t one third of the promotions to be made
;. selection. This is to enable the Presl
dextt u> reward especially gallant and mÂ«r
itorloua services. It recognizes both length

ihors dsjm that its provisions are so
, .'.(Hd that only the most deserving
tuuil receive fcpeCuU recognition, and in
..Â¦j cunt be "the creatures ol personal or

llitr.liill gives the President control of
the ttr.iire of office of heads of staft" de
. Lrtmenf . and he may, by and with the
fcdvtca and consent of the Senate, mak? a
:.ct* head of & department at any time
v. hen, in his Judgment, the efficiency of
I â¢ service would be increased therebyâ
Urn oltleer relieved being transferred to
liie retired list. This places tue army staff
â¢ n about the same tooting as heads of
the navy staff departments. The only
;.nTnÂ«"Â«iia.te result -under this provision
Â¦nx&ld be the probable retirement of Gen
erjfcl Cgan, commissary general, now un
c rgoing suspension. In the adjutant
{-â¢i.eiitl and inspector general's depaxt
urent there will be- no further appolnt
ments but by detail from the -next lower
trade of the line for a term of four j'ears.
Â«..'fl;c:a]s say this will give a large num
ber of experienced etaff offlcers to meet

ore to be made on recommendations of
boards of ofHcers appointed to ascertain
i lie records and fitness of officers for these

i.re also to be filled in like manner. None
< { these provisions for details in any way
interfere with the tenure of officers now
iri the regular staff departments or with
rLeir. promotions as now provided by law.
They, will, however, serve one year in five
%\lth such branch of the line as the 'Sec
retary of War may designate.
Â¦Tfc* .reorganization of the artillery, the
cÂ»ly change proposed in the line of the
army, is based on advanced ideas that
iÂ»rÂ«i larpely in use in other countries, and
is called for by the present system ofsea
coast defense. It Insures the care of the
heavy ordnance and the training ot offi
cers and men to handle -these guns in
active service:
Th^ office of post chaplain Is abolished,
i.nd "a chaplain provided for each regi
r.ent of the line of the army, regular and
volunteer. The chaplain's rank and pay
tro made those of a captain mounted.
The proposed Increase . of the artillery

FATHER AND SON
ABE ACCUSED OF
BRUTAL ASSAULT
Grave Charges in a
Divorce Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 19.
In a bill for divorce filed by Mary Ann
Hart to-day against John Hart, a wealthy
citizen of Berkeley, the woman accuses her
husband and his grown-up son by a forroT
marriage with the .most violent kind of
cruelty. She claims that she was beaten
by one and battered by the other on bo
many different occasions and with such
great severity that she finally was, com
pelled to leave her home through fear of
her life.
The complainant was married to the se
nior Hart at San Francisco on May 27.
1894, and according to her narration of
grievances she has lived unhappily almost
ever since the ceremony was performed.
She asserts that her husband has a most
violent-temper and that a similar one was
evidently inherited by his son. v .
"Oftentimes my husband has urged his
son by his first wife to beat me," she al
leged, "and when the young man obeyed
the father would look on and make ap
proving remarks while the young fellow
rained Dlow after blow upon my head and
body with his big fists."
At other times the old man Is accused
of creating a diversion In his household
imbroglios by allowing his brawny son to
act -as spectator while he pummeled his
much abused spouse. Another method,
which lent novelty to these fisticuff af
fairs, was for both sire and son to make
a simultaneous attack upon the" woman.
Her troubles culminated, she declared,
on the Bth of this month. At the beating
she received then, she says, she was ren
dered unconscious and afterward had to
flee to the house of a neighbor to avoid be
injr murdered. The couple have two small
children. Hart is said to be individually
worth' upward of $15,000, besides which
there Is a large amount of community
property. She wants a divorce, a division
of the estate and alimony.
OAKLAND'S BOND
ELECTION MUST
BE POSTPONED
Lack of Money and
Time the Cause.
OAKLAND, 'Feb. 19. -^-Councilman Bar
stow introduced a resolution In the Coun
cil to-night ordering the revocation of the
appointment of M. K. Miller as consulting
engineer at {200 a month to aid In the pro
posed bond issue. As a reason for doing
so the sponsor of the measure stated that,
owing to a deficit In the city's finances,
the inability to have voters registered in
time and other obstacles, it will be im
possible to have the bond election held
during the present fiscal year. For that
reason he thought the retention of Mr.
Miller would entail an unnecessary ex
pense. The resolution was referred to the
committee of the whole without comment.
Mayor Snow sent a veto of the ordinance
calling for bids for a new City Hall site. As
a reason his Honor stated that before pass-
Ing such a measure It should first be
learned whether the people wanted a new
City Hall. He also thought that the spe
cial citizens' committee should be con
sulted before taking any final action.
Â¦ "We do not need any advice from special
committees of citizens," declared Council
man Mott. "and I move that the veto be
overruled. It was. done without any
more dlscuwion. .;.

are believed to be preliminary to the
foundation of such a church as Mr. Mills
had in Boston should he decide to leave
Oakland and begin his work across . the
bay. Â¦ . . â¢ - .
Colonel John P. Irish has been appoint
ed a committee of one by the trustees of
the First Unitarian Church to confer with
Mr. Mills as to his plans for the future.
Colonel Irish has not yet seen Mr. Mills,
but he will do so In time to report to the
annual meeting of the church on Friday
evening next.
With regard to his plans Mr. Mills-made
the following statement this morning:
I have 'made no decision yet concerning my
plans for the immediate future. I came to this
coast to rest and had not the slightest Inten
tion of preaching In San Francisco. 1 did
not even Intend to preach In Oakland, and have
consented to do so thus far only on condition
that I have nÂ« pastoral obligations. I am
deeply Interested In the Oakland church and
regard it as one of the most promising organi
zations In the country. It. la also true that
there are a number of San Franciscans who
wish me to speak there.
I have not conferred with the Oakland trus
tees yet and no one on earth knows whether I
will preach in San Francisco or Oakland, oi In
I will carry out my original plan and spend a
year In retirement. I speak next Sunday morn-
Ing in the Oakland church and In the after
noon In the Metropolitan Temple In San Fran
cisco, but have made no further engagements
anywhere.
COEUR D'ALENE INQUIRY.
House Committee Spends a Day Dis- '
cussing Procedure.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The investiga
tion, of charges as to the conduct of the
I'nited States military forces under Brig
adier-General Merriam during the Idaho
mining troubles last summer began to
r.uy before the House Committee on Mili
:;>.ryAffairs. Governor Steuner.berg of Ida
ho. State Auditor Sinclair. General Al'sr
r;am, ex-General Master Workman-Sover
Â«lgp of :he Knights of Labor, E. J. Flani-
Ki:i of the Idaho Legislature, a migistrite
Â¦ : Mullan. Idaho, and a considerable dclo
f^.itioii of miners from the Coeur d'Alene
ti.?trict were present.
The entire time was consumed in dis
cussing the manner of procedure. Several
r.<Â»inbers wanted Representative Lentz,
who started the inquiry 1 , to act as com
] !air,ant and prosecutor, but he declined
to accept this position, and urged that
lhere should be a free and full investiga
tion. He said there was no partisanship
In the lnveptigatÂ«oÂ»,jandjie merely wished
to gÂ£t at the charges, which labor organi
zations regarded aa serious and which
wÂ«re wisely made in the press.
Representative Marsh of Illinois also
urged that as Lentz had formulated the
charges he ehould proceed in his own way.
There should be the fullest investigation,
"so that It couid not be. said anything was
'smothered.' "
Chairman Hull did not think the com
mittee could abdicate its functions to
la?mz. Marsh resented this remark as a
misinterpretation of his position, and Hull
disavowed any such purpose.
A resolution by Hay of Virginia that the
complaining witness be first examined
was df-bated at length and without r..*
pult. The committee adjourned until to
ruorrow morning, when it is expected the
line of procedure will be adopted and the !
txamination of witnesses begun.

Literal prizes have been offered by the
manaKemoiit of the association for the
most artistic displays, hence the rivalry
along that line.
An excursion rate of one fare for the
round trip has been arranged from San
Francisco, going and returning during the
fair. Sonoma county day, which will be
en .thÂ« 22d, will undoubtedly be the big

OAKLAND, Feb. 19.â Two pretty chorus girls from Morosco'a opera company sang a plaintive duetto an obdurate cop
last night In vain endeavor to melt his heart and secure their freedom. They were scorching across the Twelfth
street dam when Policeman Turner gathered them In for violating tho bicycle ordinance In riding on the sidewalk.
At the station they gave the names of Miss Jennie Ennls and Mrs. Addie Arnold, and they warbled "Mr. Johnson,
Turn Me Loose," in the ear of Pollcollce Captain Wilson.
"You'll have to get somebody to go your ball first," chirped the captain in his choicest basso profundo notes. â¢
Neither the ladles of the chorus nor several other members of the company who appeared atthe City Prison later had
the requisite $10. Landers Stevens of the Dewey Theater was finally appealed to, and he got the'young women out of their
predicament by advancing the cash. First there were tears and then there was a whirlwind of anger. They were goingto
make Oakland and its ungallant police department return Mr. Stevens' money, and they were going to fight the case and
the police in every court in the land. . .
But the fair maids from the dramatic world across the bay evidently changed their minds to-day. When their names
were called there was never a sound, and then Mr. Stevens' $10 went to make up the deficit that is facing the city of Oak
land.
AGAINST FORTIFICATION
OF NICARAGUA CANAL
Senator Perkins Favors the Hay- "
Pauncefote Treaty.
Mayor Phelan yesterday received a com- .
munication from Senator Perkins. In
which he outlines bla position on the pro- .
posed Nicaragua Canal as follows:
Â¦WASHINGTON. D. C. Feb. 13. 1300.
Hon. James D. Phelan. Mayor. San Francisco.
Caiâ My Dear Sir: I am In receipt of your tele- -
gram of the 10th Inst. relative to the necessity
(or fortifying thÂ« Nicaragua, canal. That is a
question on which there Is a diversity of opin
ion. lam Inclined to think that the best naval
and military opinion Is against fortification. It
is urged, and, I think, urged forcibly, that the
only effective protection for the canal will be
from our fleet with suitable banes In the i';inh
bean Sea. no one of which should be Greytown.
It Is pointed out that an enemy In front could
blockade the canal In spite of all fortiacation.
while in the rear a single man with ten pounds
of dynamite could destroy the waterway. There
fore it Is deemed that it would bÂ« a waste of
money to build defenses; that an equal amount
of money expended on battleships and bases
of supply would be far more effective.
It Is thought to have been made clear from
the late war that the nation which commands
the Caribbean Sea will control the canal, and
that there could be no defense of the canal .
against a power that controlled the sea. That
seems to be the military Judgment, aa far a3
It has yet been given, but the discussion Is not
yet over; Indeed. It has Just begun. I give the
above argument for what it is worth. As for
myself, desiring the best for the canal. I am
listening to all the arguments and hope to de
cide right when the time comes.
The recently proposed Hay-Pauncefote treaty
has a bearing upon the canal which Is beln*
made use- of by the enemies of that enterprise.
The opposition to the treaty seems to be in all
respects the same that has always opposed thÂ»
canal. It seems to come from the game quarter
and to be actuated by the same spirit. It Is
therefore In my opinion an opposition to the
canal Itself. Th's confirms me in my confidence
in the* Justness and advisability of the meaa
ure and I shall votÂ» for It unless I find that
the people of California are opposed. I remain,
yours verr truly. QEOROE c _ p^^g.

Root has turned over to General Ludlow
his plan to secure the creation of a re
serve list of persons in civil life who are

Torres and the Mexican forces, who are
now Bupposed to be some fifty miles or
more in the Immediate center of the Yaqul

soldiers.

ONCE MORE THE
BOSTONIANS IN
FLIMSY OPERA
Frpthingham Saves

HERBERT'S TUNES ARE STICKY
DEGENERATION OF THE ONCE
FAMOTTS > COMPANY.
The Alcazar Company in "A Prodigal
Father"â Faroe at the Calif or
'; v niaâ No Change at the
Other Houses.
One Bong: will not: make ah opera any
more than the proverbial swallow makes
a summer, but thanks to George Froth
ingham "The Serenade" Is quite an ac
ceptable -entertainment. Frothlngham is
funny without the assistance of the libret
tist, and I- do not think any one ever
yawns when he is on the stage. It Is not
so with the other members of the com
pany, who do little to relieve the cloying
tedioushess of ,th opera, â¢/
"The Serenade" makes me feel like a
fly in molasses. It Is so sicky sweet and
progressive, though It is so wearisome
and slow. Then, too, there- is that erer
lasting "I love thee. I adore thee" war
bled ad nauseum and fastening itself on
one with all the pernicious escapeleasness
of the cigarette habit. It would not be
so bad if the insidious thing were musi
cally less vulgar, but it is a piece with the
rest of Victor Herbert's compositions
which are in every grade of musical merit
from the worst up to the third class.
There are one or two songs In The
Serenade" that are much better than the
serenade itself, and some of the music
shows a decided Ingenuity, but there is a
yellow streak in all of it and in the or
chestration Mr. Herbert's obvious efforts
to be different, which he mistakes for
originality, frequently are productive of
the most distracting sounds. I say dis
tracting because they distract ones at
tention from the stage in a most imperti
nent manner.
Herbert's airs are jingles and his ac
companiments Jingle, and yet he is tne
foremost composer- of comic opera In
America to-day. Verily the Bostonians
have degenerated. Time was when they
sang in "Mlgnon" and "Don Pasquale"
and even "Faust," and "Fra Diavolo ' wa3
a staple with them, but now It is "Robin
Hood," "The Serenade" and "The Vice
roy." Their excursion Into Mlnkowsky s
"Smugglers of. Badayez" was a step up
ward, for in spite of Its faults this first
attempt of a young composer has an un
questionable musical importance. But In
order to make it fit the decrescent stand
ards of the organization and the public
taste, Minkowsky's work was vulgarized
and distorted and three or four insuffer
ably cheap,' nasty and catchy "tunes'
were grafted on it by Mr. Stadley, the
conductor of the orchestra.
Before leaving Victor Herbert in peace
or pieces; I hold It my solemn duty to
state that "The Viceroy," two acts of
which I thought were tolerable, pulls
down so hard in the third that It might
even be heard in New York. Mr.' Smith
must stand his share of responsibility, for
the last chapter^ of n ia book Is hopelessly
flat. There is a difference between flat
ness' and dullness. In "The Viceroy." af
ter two acts quite decently spangled with
wit, comes one wherein Smith tries and
tries, but fails to land. This is flat. In
"The Serenade" there are no spangles
and no particular effort, Just a lot of stu
pid drivel to carry out a plot that it Is
acknowledged was taken from some one
else. Â¦ ' â¢ â¢
Aside from Frothlngham there is no one
in the cast that may be mentioned with
praise unless it be Mr. Fitzgerald, in a
small part. Miss Cameron shrilled a
waltz song and brought down the house
for three . encores with a few. "Lucia
cadenzas, although' the average audience
is "easy ' when it comes Â¦- to cadenzas.
Miss Cameron did her little, nourish and
took her top note very neatly. The beau
tiful van Dresser cannot sing, but the
scenery was admirable. . â¢
? -.. PORTER GARNETT.
OTpneum.
Kathryn Osterman, pretty, graceful and
sweet-voiced, faced a critical audience
last night In the Orpheum as a stranger
seeking to win laurels on the vaudeville
stage, to supplant the ones she has won
on the legitimate as a comedienne. She
had to rub out the slate of her past vic
tories and begin all over again so far as
San Francisco audiences are concerned,
and she succeeded in winning, as her
friends told her she would, the approba
tion of the proverbially cold and hard-to
please San Franciscans. "The Editor" la
a sketch that, although clever, does not
afford her the opportunity of doing her
best; but in. spite of this drawback she
proved her merit. When she first ap
peared before the footlights last night not
a hand clap greeted her. There were no
Claquers in the house, and it was an in
timation to her that She would have to
ride with spurs to win, and she did It in a
canter. She has a magnetic presence, a
genuine laugh and the poetry of motion.
No wonder that the house rose up at her
and applauded and laughed until the tears
came.
The bill this week is a fine one. DÂ«
Witt and Burns do a grotesque and diffi
cult acrobatic act: Fanny Fields "caught
on" with the boys as a Jolly Dutch girl,
and Harris and Fields are irresistibly
funny in the pool gams. The last week's
holdovers are better than ever, Monroe
and Mack, Deets and Don. and Cushman,
Holcombe and Curtis being the bright,
particular stars.
Alcazar. â¢
The rain last night did not prevent a
large audience from gathering at the Al
cazar Theater, ' when the farce-comedy,
"The Prodigal Father," was presented.
It is full of funny situations, which kept
the audience laughing almost from the
rise to the fall of the, curtain. Stanley
Dodge, president of the Geographical So
ciety, starts with his servant to make an
exploration in Africa for the benefit of
the society, but while In New York, prior
to embarking on the steamer, he falls In
love with Dollie Bonde. a vaudeville art
ist, and pursues her. when he gets home
he-concocts the story of being In Africa,
which gets him into no end of .amusing
complications. The cast is composed oi
Jeffrey Williams as Stanley Dodge; May
Blayney and Laura Crews, his daughters;
Stanley Ross,- his sOn: Mary Hampton,
Dollie Bonde; little Edith Cooper, Blrdi
â¢kins, her child; Ernest Hastings. Tom
Breeze; Howard: Scott, Rev. Mlldway
Smiles; f George P.- Webster, Cateeby
Duff.vtragedian and' journalist; Carlyle
Moore, Dodge's valet; and Georgia Wood
thorpe, the waiting-maid.
California. '
Considering the weather and other, draw
backs there was a fair attendance at the
California Theater last evening to witness
the farce comedy "Who is Who," by Her
bert Hall Winslow._ Most of the fun was
provided hy Charles A. Pusey and Bert
St.' John, while Metta Miller furnlshel the
good looks of the show. Those who enjoy
plenty of stage life and exercise may find
r 'WTio is Who" father attractive. The
scenery and furnishings are good. The
next attraction at the California will be
Maggie Moore and her Australian com
pany, which will present "The Silence of
Dean Maltland.V commencing with Sun
day matinee. Â¦ . . . .
â¢. Tlvoli.
The rain did not diminish the attendance
at the Tlyoll last night. "The Idol's Eye"
has had an unprecedented run and bids
fair to crowd the popular playhouse
throughout.- the week.- New songs and
"gags nave been introduced, and theater
goers who have â¢ already seen the opera,
can *go again and d*rlve aa much pleasure
as on the first occasion. "Teddy '- Hart
man like old wine, loses none of hia
sparkle, and continues to keep. his audi
ence in good spirits. 'He is Â¦. ably abetted
by Alf C. Wheelun, the "Hoot Mon." Tom
Green nang in good voice last night, and
Miss Graham had to repeat her beautiful
waltz song; and the other members of the
company received warm applause for their
efforts, r... i. . ; -'. ' .Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦> Â¦Â¦?.â¢Â¦- .:'Â¦. >

dent. The nature of her evidence would
tend to show that she has a few facts up
her sleeve that will knock the props fxcm
beneath the Sylva-Simpton statements.
She claims to be able to show that she
had not visited Sausallto unless accompa
nied by some of her attorneys or their
representatives, who never left her side,
and that as a consequence she could not
have entered into the conspiracy with
Sylva and Simpton without the knowledge
of her counsel. They protest with em
phasis that their client had no occasion
to buy either the Sausalito attorney or the
Marin County Justice of the Peace.
A so called "fishing expedition" by thfl
Craven-Fair forces to locate the account
books and diaries of the dead Senator
failed, but the attorneys still eritertnin
hopes of getting a bite on their hooks.
The Fair aggregation of legal talent, with
out admitting the books existed, contend
ed that Mrs. Craven-Fair wanted them to
fix dates that would dovetail with her
story of the marriage contract and subse
quent developments In her alleged matri
monial alliance with Fair.
Lafe Pence of her counsel denied this
flatly, and as evidence of good faith aske.i
that the documents be sealed and left In
the hands of the court until Mrs. Craven-
Fair had completed her testimony. The
opposition would not entertain the propo
sition, preferring that Pence should pro
ceed with his "fishing.'.'

the District Attorney,

to the Attention of

Dead Senator's Silken
Nightgown the Only
Sensation Devel
oped Yesterday Dur
ing the Progress of
the Celebrated Trial.
During the. progress of the case yester
day Lafe Pence for Mrs. Craven-Fair and
Garret McEnerney and William A. Pier
son, representing the Fair Interests, were
the principals In most of the Jawbone ex
ercise. Attorney Knight was in evidence
at the start, but as. soon as the Simpton
part of the play was disposed of he left
the courtroom. Â¦ â¢
Mrs. Craven-Fair was accompanied by
her daughter and a mutual .friend, Mrs.
Hilbert. The latter was an Interesting
figure In the courtroom during the morn
ing' session. Rumors were rife that she
was another â¢of the Important witnesses
to be introduced into" the case; but Mrs.
Craven-Fair asserts that she is only a
friend whose husband handles that par
ticular branch of beer manufactured by
Son-in-law Koehler. . ".'
As soon as the Fair case was called At
torney Lafe Pence, in a tone that gave an
Indication that he was about to call the
court's attention to the sensational Inci
dents of the past week, said that certain
things had. transpired during the adjourn
ment that he deemed it his duty to call
to the court's attention.
Judge Troutt knew all about -It, and he
said so. His Honor stated that he had
read the newspapers, and basing his ac
tion upon the information gleaned from
their columns he had conferred with the
District Attorney.
"With the powers he has," said the
Judge, "he will be able to speedily In
vestigate all of these matters, and I pre
fer to avoid a discussion of them. now."
Pence replied that there had been some
talk of a special session of the Grand
Jury to take up the charges and counter
charges which have become a feature of
the case.
"Pending that, however," said Pence,
"I would suggest that this court reach
out the strong arm of the law for the
guilty, as some court will have to do some
day. It should reach even across the bay,
as it will have to point in the same direc
tion when it gets through with the crim
inals in this case."
Mr. Knight made himself heard at this
point, and In his most dramatic attitude
strove to set his side of the controversy
right. .
"What is before the court that Is so
serious?" he Inquired. "Has any one
charged perjury here? Is there any testi
mony before this court that perjury has
been committed? Mr. Pence will not be
allowed to create the impression 'that he
and his client are taking the initiative in
this matter. Why has not the District
Attorney called both sides Into consulta
tion In this affair?
"I contend that there Is nothing to In
vestigate. No perjury has been commit
ted; even a Justice of the Peace lawyer
should know that much. Let them bring
on their charges. We are ready to meet
them." ~ < -
To Â¦ this Mr. Pence retorted: "If the
other side does not think that swearlnjr to
an affidavit one way one day and another
way the day after is not perjury I give
them the advice I did beforeâ go hire a
lawyer."
And there the Simpton matter ended,
without once mentioning by name the
principals in the Sausalito conspiracy.
Mr. Pence then attempted to get the
court to order the stenographer to fur
nish him with copies of the testimony at
the expense of the estate. McEnerney
objected, on the ground that it might be
construed as an acknowledgment that
Mrs. Craven-Fair had some legal claim
against the estate, which contention was
sustained by Judge Troutt.
"Well, then, we'll call Attorney Plerson
to see if we can get those memorandum
books we are after," said Pence.
Plerson, while not admitting that he
had any such books, took refuge behind
Dr. .Parker's Couth.Cun. One done will stop

Lack of Stenographers Causes Delay
in Criminal Trials and Attor-

The practice of trying all misdemeanor
cases In | two pf the four Police Courts
and felony cases In the other two courts
is not working well. It was started oe
cause of a lack of stenographers, but the
Police Judges say it Is worse than before.
There are so many felony cases In Judge
Mogan's court that it will be a consid

and as a result the attorneys of defend

to apply for writs of habeas corpus In the

This proposed ordinance was referred to
the license committee and without delay
will take the customary course of legis
lation through the board. On Monday
next Supervisor McCarthy will introduce
his order providing for an amendment to
the charter- by which the telephone mo
nopoly will be forced to submit to super
visorial regulation and restriction. This
will strike at the very root of the evil;
and it goes without saying that it will re
ceive popular as well as official approval.
Lawyers thoroughly Informed In consti
tutional law are preparing the proposed
order, and the City Attorney will be asked
to. give his opinion upon, points in which
there may be the slightest question. It
seems probable now that fifteen per cent
of the electors who voted at the last
municipal election must sign a petition' if
a special election is to be held. As " the
matter is of such vital importance, it is
very likely that prominent citizens will
confer wth Supervisor McCarthy and oth
ers relative to the best means of circulat
ing the petition. -
CITY'S FINANCIAL WOE.
Supervisors Still Struggle With
Perplexing Questions.
The recommendation of the Finance
Committee to shut off the lights of the
city from March 1 to July 1 met with such
a storm of opposition from citizens gen
erally at yesterday'B meeting of the Board
of Supervisors that it was decided to post
pone consideration until the next meet
ing. Many protests had been received
from Improvement clubs aryl private cltl
aens against placing the city in darkness
for four months, and . the board was ad
dressed by A. S. Llllle, president of the
Mission Federated Clubs, who acte-.l as
spokesman for all the protestants. Mr.
Lillie thought that it would be a poor
measure of economy to save $80,000 by
turning off the lights which would cause
a much greater loss to property owners
by driving people away from the city.
"It is a sad commentary on a munici
pality," said Mr. Lillie, "that is about to
issue $11,000,000 in bonds and yet is unable
to keep its streets lighted. There are
other means to meet the deficiency if
the Finance Committee will only look for
them. The Board of Health and other
departments should be inquired into for
raising salaries and creating positions,
and the St. Mary's Park fund might be
utilized."
"Suppose the Finance. Committee." sai<]
Reed, "has found it impossible to find
a- way- out of the difficulty?" Â¦
"Well," said Llllle, "we ye elected you
gentlemen and I suppose we've got to
stand the ; consequences." which remark
met with a general laugh. â¢
Supervisor Tobln stated that very little
could be gained by scaling down salaries,
as they were . provided for In most cases
by the. charter. He .was of .the. opinion
that It was absolutely necessary to shut
THE Supervisors are fixed in their
determination to force the local
telephone monopoly down to the
same equality before the law as
other quasi public corporations of
this city occupy. The telephone people
are now absolutely above the law. Time
after time efforts have vainly been made
to compel them to act^ln Justice toward
their patrons. The charter makers were
deceived and cheated out of a provision
that an overwhelming majority would
have ' adopted. Every ! attempt at local
legislation has met with failure because
of inaccuracies, ambiguities or illegali
ties, but the new board is not discouraged
and with Supervisor McCarthy taking
the Initiative will try again. The first
step was taken yesterday in the Introduc
tion of a new. ordinance and another and
tar more . important one will mark the
proceedings of the board next Monday.
It will be remembered that the Board
Gaopted an ordinance providing for the
licensing of nickel-in-the-slot telephones.
The measure was presented to Mayor
Phelan and has been returned by him as
inadequate and in various respects ille
gral. The Mayor decides that he cannot
approve the ordinance, as It was ambig
uous In several- respects and was ob
viously illegal in discriminating against
certain classes. The Mayor returned it
therefore without his signature, but with
the recommendation that another ordi
nance, meeting the objections and con
forming to the law, be adopted by the
board. ,'Â¦
The necessity for immediate action in
thie matter Is universally recognized. The
telephone company has made its monop
oly the vehicle for enormous profits. So
secure has the corporation felt its posi
tion to be that it has acted toward the
public with unexampled arrogance and
insolence. It has forced people in thou
sands of Instances to pay for what they
Â«lld not receive and no endeavor, threat
or entreaty has succeeded in making the
company change or modify its policy.
The immediate need of doing something
therefore has been felt on all sides. So
when Mayor Phelan presented his veto
and his recommendation yesterday Su
pervisor McCarthy was ready with an
other ordinance which it is expected will
meet all objections and prove adequate
as the remedy for the nickel-in-the-slot
telephone evil. The new proposed ordi
nance is modeled very closely upon one
which is now in successful operation In
the city of Ogden. The Dgden ordinance
Â¦was attacked as vigorously as have been
the proposed ones for this city. The tele
phone people of Ogden fought the legis
lation, and after *>eing defeated carried
the matter into the courts, winning a
victory in the trial court.
The authorities of Ogden were not dis
couraged, however, and carried the fight
to the appellate court of Utah. This
tribunal Bustalned the ordinance which is
now In operation in the town of Ogden.
The ordinance which Supervisor Mc-
Carthy presented yesterday Is modeled
upon that of. Ogden, but adapted to the
local restrictions of the charter. It is as
follows:
Requiring a licence to be paid for operating
and maintaining telephone in the city and
county of Ban Francisco.
Be It ordered by the people of the city and
county of San Francisco a* follows:
Section L It shall be unlawful for any per

taining a license for each i<*lephoaÂ». Instru

Sec 2. Every person, company or corpora

aad county of San Francisco any telephone In

off the lights to help meet the deficiency.
He suggested that the City Attorney bo
requested for his opinion as to whether
salaries for June could be carried over
under the charter until the next fiscal
year, thus creating an artificial surplus
of J150.000. If a favorable decision la ren
dered the alleged necessity of throwing
the streets In darkness may be avoided.
The appropriation of $35,000 allowed by
the board to the Board of Health until
June 30 is evidently in danger of being r<=
duced, for when the resolutions on that
point came up for final passage Reed
moved that It be cut to $20,000. Tobin
amended by postponing consideration until
the next meeting, when it Is expected the
financial tangle may be unraveled.
The opening of bids for official advertis
ing was also laid over until the opinion
of the City Attorney may be obtained re
garding the validity of the specifications
inviting proposals that the newspaper bid
ding must bear the label of the Allied
Printing Trades Council.
It was resolved to suspend temporarily
the payment of all bills incurred by the
: city during the preceding regime until
such time as a means may be afforded
to pay creditors; and, further, that all
moneys now In the general fund and avail
able for this purpose, be used for the pay
ment of any Indebtedness incurred by this
administration during the balance of this
fiscal year.
The city undertaker was directedito fur
nish, the board with a monthly statement,
giving the name and date of death of all
persons buried by him as indigents, and
also of all persons whose bodies are de
livered by him to medical colleges and
institutions where the remains of indigent
dead are used for scientific investigations.
The demands of Janitors for October
and December, 1899, aggregating $1514 &5,
were ordered approved, subject to a uni
form reduction to meet the money on
hand available to liquidate them, amount
ing to $1235.
An ordinance consenting to the aban
donment by the San Francisco and "San
Mateo Electric Railway Company of a
portion of its franchise on Steuart street
was re-referred to the street committee
to insert a clause requiring the company
to tear up the tracks and put the street in
its original condition.
The Board of Public Works was re
quested to examine into and report upon
the petition of the Hospital Lot-Park Im
provement Club, requesting the clearing
away of rubbish and the planting' with
trees and grass of a lot bounded by Wal
ler. Ridley, Steiner and Scott streets.
The City Attorney was requested to
render an opinion as to the validity of
the order requiring property owners to
place at all street crossings signs bearing
the names of cross streets.'
The request of South San Francisco.lm
provement Club for a slxteen-room brick
Bchoolhouse In that district was referred
to the Board of Education for examina
tion.
The superintendents of the Whittier Re
form School, Boys and Girls' Aid Society,
Preston School of Industry and Magda
len Asylum were requested to file with
each demand on the treasury for the care
of inmates, such Information as will al
low the board to certify to the correct
ness of the demands; also to Inform the
board when the city will be relieved from
maintaining the Inmates.
. -The bill authorizing the Auditor to em
ploy four extra clerks at $100 per month
to hÂ«^d at the pleasure of the board was
laid over for one week. Reed objected to
assuming any new obligations in the face
of the;citv's financial troubles, and It de
veloped that the clerks are already em
ployed.
The ordinance fixing the wages of la
borers in the street department at $2 50
per day for eight hours was passed to
print.
The street committee recommended that
Gray Brothers abate all nuisances com
plained of in connection with their blast
ing and rock crushing, within ninety
days, or its permit be revoked; also that
the tracks of the Southern â¢ Pacific : Com
pany in the Mission district be declared a
public nuisance and abated. /
The Police Committee recommended
that the "following bills be reduced:
. C.." .TVeÃtphal, . stabling: . and feeding: - eipht
horses and hospital exsenses for the month : of
blast on block 14, as per map A of the Castro
street addition; accepting the surrender by the
San Mateo Electric Railway Company of that
portion of Its franchise to operate a street
railway on Steuart street from the south line
of Market to the. north line of Howard.
The application of the I}ay and Coast Rail
way Company for a franchise to operate a
steam railroad across certain public streets
of San Francisco was refused.
A resolution was passed to print that the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company be notified
to forthwith remove the tracks of its road
in the Mission district, which is operated with
out a franchise.

FELL DEAD ON THE
STEPS OF A CHURCH
Miss Mary Ford Expires on Her Way
Home After a Visit to the
Confessional.
Miss Mary J. Ford, who conducted a
variety store at 2572 Market street, died
of heart disease on the steps of St. Igna-
tlus Church yesterday afternoon. The
woman, who was very pious, had just
been to confession and was passing out
of the church on her way to her home
when death overtook her.
Miss Ford has been under the treatment
of Dr. C. C. Mohun for some time. Her
ailment was heart disease, aad she wus
about to have an operation performed.
Yesterday she went to confession, and
after saying a few prayers in the church
passed out of the door. She was about
half-way down the long flight of stone
stairs when she was seen to topple over
and fall. "When help was at the side of
the unfortunate woman she was dead.
Miss Ford was 44 years of age and haa
relatives in this city.
THE most interesting testimony
brought out yesterday at the re
sumption of the hearing before
Judge Troutt of Mrs. Craven-Fair's
petition for a family allowance
from the Fair estate was the state
ment by the petitioner that the late Sen
ator Fair owned a silk nightshirt. The
airing of the dead millionaire's silken
"niphtie" on Judge Troutt's clothesline
created quite a stir among the crowd that
occupied every bit of standing room in
the court.
Contrary to expectations, the promised
tilt between the opposing attorneys over
the Simpton affair did not occur. There
might have been something exciting in
connection with it had not the Judge shut
off the attorneys' wind by announcing
that he had assisted in passing the mat
ter up to District Attorney Byington and
the Grand Jury.
In fome of her testimony the petitioner
got dangerously near the Sausallto lncl-

the assertion that if he had them they
were given him by the executors as their
attorney and were consequently confi
dential communications in the eyes of the
law. Judge Troutt agreed with him, ana
held that the petitioner must first lay a
foundation for the line of questioning by
the testimony of one of the executors.
W. S Goodfellow was sworn, but knew
absolutely nothing about the books In
question. The other executors are be
yond the Jurisdiction of the court, and
until they are located Mr. Pence will
cease to "fish."
Mrs. Craven-Fair was then called and
occupied the attention of the court and
the attorneys during the remainder of
the session. Her demeanor was extreme
ly cool. She was deliberate in all her
testimony, took care that she thoroughly
understood overy question asked her and
was extremely particular as to detail.
Her cross-examination was conducted by
Attorney Pierson. He questioned her as
to her different abodes and trips about
the country from 1893 up to the beginning
of 1900. Then he went back further and
delved Into the alleged billing and cooing
between her and Senator Fair.
Slight reference was made to the mar
riage contract, but there was a searching
examination of the events that immedi
ately followed the consummation of the
alleged matrimonial alliance.
It was during this line of examination
that Attorney Pierson asked if the Sen
ator kept his wardrobe at the Craven
residence. 523 Sutter street.
"Only a silk night robe." was the reply,
and an audible titter arose from the
lobby. 'â¢ â¢."Â¦â¢
Pence objected to inquiring Into the
places and persons Mrs. Craven-Fair had
visited, claiming it would disclose. the
names and residences of some of her wit
nesses. The court overruled the objec
tion.
Referring to her career as a pedagogue
Plerson asked Mrs. Craven-Fair If It was
not a fact that she started as a second
grade teacher. â¢ .--Â¦>'
"Oh. no," was the quick reply; "I was
a first-class teacher of a second grade.
She repeated the old story of how Fair
had taken her one evening to the home of
a minister to get married, and when they
reached the front door she happened to
think that he had no license She ran
away like a coy little girl, going down
hill because she could make better speed
that way, and the Senator went running
after her something after the style of
Jack and Jill.

she told of several trips to San Rafael
and three visits to Sausallto. The latter
occurred during July or August. She tes
tified:
"I went the first time with Louis Du
nand, an attorney of this city. The sec
ond trip was made with Mr. Dunand and
John Lerman, clerk for W. W. Foote,
and the last was in company with Charles
Pence. These gentlemen were with me all
the time I was In Sausallto."
Her cross-examination had not been
completed when court adjourned until XX
o'clock this morning.
