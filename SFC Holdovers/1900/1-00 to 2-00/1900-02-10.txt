BOER REPORTS OF
THE BRITISH REVERSES
BOER HEAD LAAGER, LADYSMITII.
Feb. B.â The British who were in posses
sion of the kopje at Molens Drift aban
doned it after a bombardment by the Boer
cannon this' moi-ning. and retired across
the Tugela River to their former position.
A desultory cannonade Is proceeding at
the Tugela this morning, but otherwise
everything is quiet.
HEAD LAAGER, LADYSMITH, Feb. 7.
An armored train yesterday made a sortie
from Chievely toward Colenso and landed
2000 British troops on the right of the Boer
position. The Boers immediately crowed
the river and made an attack with Â¦rifles
and artillery, forcing the withdrawal of
both the train and the troops to Chievely. 7
The fighting on. the upper Tugela River
lasted until 8:30 o'clock yesterday (Tues
day) evening. Particulars are lacking-]
Firing at Colenso and along the uppei;
Tugela has been proceeding since 5 o'clock
this morning. .

he started early enough in the day to en
able him to get here early this afternoon!
This morning General Methuen ordered
that the combined force should retire
upon the Modder River,' which movement
is now proceeding. The British losses in
the fighting on Wednesday were fifty men
killed or wounded.
LONDON. Feb. 10. 4:20 a. m.â London
accepts as true the Boer statement
that General Buller has failed again.
These statements were passed by
the British censor at Aden and are
read in the light cf Mr. Balfour's an
nouncement in the Commons that Bul
ler is not pressing his advance. Winston
Churchill wires that Vaal Krantz was
impracticable for the guns which were
needed to, support a further advance. Ills
cablegram leaves General Buller on Tues
day night sending a fresh brigade to re
lieve the tired holders of Vaal Krantz.
The descriptive writers with General
Buller were allowed a rather free hand
again in explaining the ugly position
which the British held and the natural
obstacles which had to be overcome. So
it is easy to Infer that with Boer riflemen
and artillery defending them these hills.

ravines and Jungles have not been over

Heliograms from Ladysmith dated Mon

Hope ran high that the long period of in

tinuous for ' ten hours, and at times it

ROBERTS ABOUT TO
BEGIN HIS CAMPAIGN
LONDON, Feb. 10.â In the Morning Post
to-day Mr. Spencer Wilkinson, reviewing
the military situation, says:
"Lord Roberts is evidently about to be
gin his campaign and there are signs that
General Methuen's force will make the
first important move. It is probable that
the Seventh Division will soon be heard of
as co-operating with Methuen.
"The latest news regarding General Bul
ler's operation is puzzling. It looks now as
if he never seriously contemplated an at
tempt to 'relieve Ladysmith, but only a'
demonstration to prevent the Boers from
diverting reinforcements to Magersfon
tein.
"Looking to the distance from Lady
smith to Kimberley. a Journey in which
the Boers would get little help for the
transport of their forces. Lord Roberts
has a clear week for the first blow, which
will put a new face upon the situation.
This hypothesis would account for the
present state of things in both the thea
ters of war and the peculiarities of the
attacks on Monday and Tuesday would
become intelligible, for, if they had been
intended as a serious movement. General
Buller would have been largely reinforced
and would have pushed the attack with
greater energy."

LONDON, Feb. 10.âGen
m eral Buller's third attempt
to reach Ladysmith ap
pears to have failed, like the two
previous ones. This morning's
news, while containing nothing
from British sources, includes a
definite and apparently trust
worthy dispatch from the Boer
head laager, outside of Lady
smith, to the effect that the Brit
ish at 9 o'clock on Thursday
inorninar abandoned the cap
tured position (\ aal Krantz) ai
ler sustaining a heavy bomoard
inent, and retired across the
Tugela River and Molen Spruit.-
The War Office has received no
confirmation of this. In fact it
was explicitly and officially
stated last night that it had re
ceived no news at all relating to
General Buller's movements.
There is, however, apparently
little reason to question the ac
curacy of the Boer dispatches or
to doubt the general statement of
facts. The Boer telegrams have
been generally correct hitherto.
Mr. Balfour said this morning
in the Commons, in answer to a
question, that the information re
ceived by the Government mdi
cated that Buller was not press
ing his advantage from the posi
tion which he still occupied on
Wednesday. There are other
statements from various sources
which would seem to indicate
that Buller had found the Boers
very strong at this point of Tues
day's fighting, and that the Boer
guns were so placed as to ab
solutely command the low ridge
called Vaal Krantz, and also the
valley between that kopje and
Doornkloof.
An agency telegram stated
that at the close of Tuesday's
fighting, after General Hild
yard's brigade had relieved Lyt
telton's, the Boers were on both
sides of the British, and the po-
sition was a difficult one to hold.
The concentration of a heavy
fire from the long range guns
such as the Boers had mounted
probably rendered the position
absolutely untenable. This is
the story of the latest defeat.
This second retirement of Bul
ler across the Tugela seems to
prove that he has a task beyond
his power, unless large reinforce
ments are sent to him, and this
is not likely now that an army is
being organized to invade the
Free State.
There is little or no prospect
of the relief of Ladysmith being
effected by the Natal field force
until the advance of Lord Rob
erts compels the Boers to
weaken their strength on the
line of the Tugela. This may
not be for some weeks, and in the
meantime can Ladysmith hold
but against another attack,
which the Boers are likely to â¢
make immediately? The be
sieged town is likely, then, to
have the fiercest fighting yet.
This new repulse of the Brit
ish will further raise the morale
of the Boer army in Natal,
which has already numerous
successes to its credit, and will
correspondingly depress the spir
its of the British soldiers. The
Boers already realize the sig
nificance of Lord Roberts' prep
arations to advance on Bloem
fontein, pf which they are, no
doubt, well informed.
The report that General Mac-
Donald has been ordered to re
tire from Kood6<^berg- to Mod
der River seems to be open to
doubt. Lord Roberts, in his of
ficial dispatch; says that "Fight
ing Mac" had driven the Boers
back. The Daily Mail's corre
spondent in a dispatch dated
Koodoosberg Thursday evening
makes no mention of any retire
ment, although the agency dis
patch which announced the
backward movement says it took
place on Thursday morning. The
censor's oversharp knife may
have been responsible for mud
dling the first message.
The Daily News correspond
ent says: "The Boers returned
to the laagers on Thursday and
the British are coming back to
camp." Whether it means the
camp at Modder River or that at
Koodoosberg is uncertain. In
any event if Mac Donald retired
it was because his purpose was
effected, as all the dispatches
state that the Boers were beaten
off.
London took the news of the
retirement of Buller philosophi
cally. All last evening an air
of gloomy expectation hung over
the House of Commons. When
the report came that the British
forces had retired across the Tu
gela the news was accepted as
true, and Balfour's discouraging
announcement produced a som
ber effect which was painfully
evident during the night- ses
sion.
The gloom was not confined
to the House. It spread to the
clubs and theaters. Everywhere
men fliscussed the latest reverses,
for it is a strange thing that no
one seemed to doubt the ac
curacy of the Boer dispatches.
A parliamentary paper issued
last evening stated the increased
number of men and the large
amount of money needed by the
War Office for the year ending
March 31 next, in consequence of
the war, serves to bring home
with renewed force the tremen
dous drain upon the empire's re
sources.
According to this statement
120,000 more men and an addi
ditional grant of Â£13,000,000
will be required. The original
estimate for men for the year.
thÂ© unobserved approach of the enemy.
A series of British mines, laid for tho
Boers, exploded accidentally, shaking and
alarming the city and camp.
General Mac Donalds retirement puzzles
the- military commenters. The theory
that finds acceptance la that it was or
dered by Lord Roberts and that both
General Buller's and General MacDonald'a
operations were by direction of the com
mander in chief, in order to occupy the
Boers at widely separated points, so they
would be unable to transfer any portion
of their forces to oppose the projected
central advance.
Charles Williams, a military writer, who
is understood to be in confidential relations
Â¦with Lord Wolseley. say 3 that beyond
doubt the most authoritative opinion in
London regards as probable that an en
deavor will be made to force the line of
the Orange River before "Wednesday next,
possibly by Monday.
Henry W. Lucy says the health of Sir
Alfred Milner, Governor of Cape Colony,
is suffering from the prolonged strain and
hi? friends fear he will break down.
Lord Salisbury's son. Lord Edwartl
Cecil, is responsible for Mafeking beins
so well provisioned. At the outbreak of
the war be learned the amount of army
stores about to be sent to Mafeking. ami
on his own initiative pledged his privats
means and had the stores quadrupled. He
is now In Mafeking and one of its boldest
defenders.
A dispatch to the Times from Koodoos
berg, dated Thursday. February S. says:
"It is reported that Boer reinforcements
are arriving from Magersfontein. Our
position is easily tenable, but the entire
force has been ordered to return to ilovl
der River to-morrow."
The Times has the following from Klm
berley, dated February 8:
"The Boer big guns shelled us all day
yesterday, but nobody was killed."
The correspondent of the Times at
Lourenzo Marques under data of Febru
ary 8 says:
"Recent visitors to Inhambane report
that the Portuguese customs authorities
there seized a quantity of arms and am
munition consigned under a false de
scription."
- The First Lord of the Admiralty, Georga
J. Goscben, is preparing- estimates for a
large increase in the navy. It is thought
probable that Parliament will be asked,

The War Office has reduced the mini

Dr. Leyds has issued in Brussels a state

ported as predicting the intervention of
th* powers in the event that the British,
invade the Free State. He says he is con
vinced that the war will continue as long
a3 the two republics have arms and am

BEATEN AND ROBBED
J. C Molgaard Found Lying on tne
Floor of His Boom in a Pool
of Blood.'
SALINAS, Feb. Â».â J. C. Molgaard, a
prominent grocer of this city, was found
to-day on the floor of his apartment, ap
parently dead. An overturned lamp, sev
eral pools of blood and the charred re
mains of books, papers, etc., as well as the
finding of small coin on the floor, tended
to snow that robbery and attempted mur
der had been committed.
After restoratives Â¦ had been adminis
tered he revived somewhat, but was de
lirious. Incoherently he muttered that he
had been beaten and robbed. He was
known to have taken considerable money
to his apartment last night from the store
and. according to the cashbook, is short
about $160. No trace of the robber has
been found. ,
The affair is causing much comment
here, and a thorough investigation will be
made; but until the injured man can talk
no clew can be established.
It is rumored that Molgaard was short
in his accounts, and that he burned the
record book himself and then attempted
to commit suicide, but there is nothing
beyond the charred remains of the book
to substantiate this theory.

GEORGE W. MARSTON, President of the Young: Men's
Christian Association Convention.
REDLANDS. Feb. 9.â Delegates to the
Btate Young Men's Christian Association
Convention continued to arrive to-day,
end great enthusiasm pervades all the
proceedings. This morning a Bible study
from the one hundred and nineteenth
Psalm was conducted by Rev. W. C.
Sherman of Sacramento.
Upon recommendation of the committee
Â©n nominations the following officers were
chosen for the ensuing year: George W.
Marston of San Diego, president; Charles
A. Maydwell of San Francisco, first vice
president; Professor C. D. Keyes of Riv
erside, second vice president; Alber John
eon of Los Angeles, third vice president;
Clifford N. Hand of Pomona College, sec
retary; John W. Berger of Occidental Col
lege, assistant secretary: J. A. Putnam
of . Redlands, press secretary. - '
â¢ W. N. Parsons. State secretary, read the
report of the State executive committee,
which was in substance as follows: Re
viewing the record of the associations of
California for the year your committee
feels that there are many things for which
ell should be profoundly thankful. It has
been a year of progress in every depart
ment or our work. Though there nave
been few events which could be termed
striking there has been a marked gain in
come respect in every association. In the
educational and physical department the
quality and breadth of the work accom
plished has been the best in the history
of California's work for young men. Con-
Eidering the fact that the State work had
been for two years without the pupervi.
don of a secretary, the lung distances be
tween associations, depression resulting
from reaction from boomed cities and
years of drought, we should be profoundly
thankful the status of the association's
work is as good as it is and with cour
age set about the task of its betterment.
There are twenty-six associations on our
listsâ fourteen city and twelve college.
The total membership is 5535. of whom
300>) are associate, 633 are in colleges, and
there are 500 Juniors. One college and
eeven city associations ocupy their own
buildings, the total value of which is
$300,000, with an indebtedness of nearly
$225,Â«Â»." leaving a total net value of $575.
000. Substantial reductions have been
made on the building indebtedness at Red
lands, Riverside and Oakland. . A lower
rate of interest has been secured on the
balance, which materially lessens the an
nual expenditures. The Sacramento as
sociation has a new home valued at $35,000.
Changes In Los Angeles give much added
.room. Santa Barbara has secured two
floors Jn a very desirable building, well
located. The current expenses and in
debtedness at Stockton have been reduced
11500. A debt of long standing at Pasa-
dena has been wiped out. Oakland's debt
has been reduced over $3500. Frank Jack
son has been supported by the State com
mittee. He has been at work with the
soldiers' committee, doing exceptionally
good work. For the use of the soldiers
returned from the Philippines camped at
the Presidio the officials In command
erected a frame building 40x80 feet and
turned it over to the State committee.
This work continued until December,
when the volunteers had gone to their
homes. Lectures, concerts, entertain
ments, etc., with frequent evangelistic
services, occupied the evenings, resulting
in the public profession of more than
three hundred. Six new regimental asso
ciations were organized at the Presidio in
regiments going to Manila. during the fall.
The committee made the following rec
ommendations: A change in the constitu
tion providing for the election of mem
bers of the State committee for a term of
three j-ears, ten being chosen each yeat :
that S4OOO at least be raised for State work
for the year, Sl5OO to be devoted to ' the
support of the society in the Philippines:
that at least 30 cents per member be: *et
aside by each association for State and in
ternational work; that in the future each
association shall before the annual con
vention nominate one member of the com
mittee for each 350 of membership; that
a greater effort be exerted to secure con
versions, and each association develop.Bi

STATE PRINTING
OFFICE INQUIRY
Committee of Senators Ap

Special Dispatch to lie CalL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Feb. 9.-The State
printing office is to be investigated
and if the present plans are carried
out the office of State Printer will
be made appointive Instead of elect
ive. The strike threatened by the
printers during the first week of
the extra session is responsible for
the trouble that is about to be pre
cipitated on Printer Johnston's
head.
Just before the Senate adjourned
this afternoon Senator Leavitt
stated there were many things in
the State printing office that needed
investigation and requested that a
committee of three hold-overs be
selected to give a thorough over
hauling to the management of the
institution and report at the next
session. Senators Leavitt, Short
ridge and Ashe were named.
It is understood in inner circles
that the move means that the State
printing office will be closed perma
nently within two .years, except
during sessions of the Legislature,
and that State work will be let out
by contract to the lowest bidder. It
Is figured that this will result in a
saving of. nearly 50 per cent in the
State's printing bills. "
The. idea of making the office of
State Printer appointive is to place
that official in a position where he
will not dare hold up the Legisla
ture by instigating a strike among
his men. Governor Gage has a lit
tle hammer out for Mr. Johnston
and is stated to be behind the pro
posed Investigation."'*â¢^*'' jy-yr*

MENTO, Feb. 9.â Senator Davis, Ama
dor*s representative In the Senate and
one of the leaders of the upper house,
sums up the work of the extra session as
follows:
The programme on the election of
United States Senator was smashed to
flinders and a man without a string to
him from any quarter has been elected
Senator. This result has infused new life
Into the Republican party and set the
pace for the coming campaign. All of the
arbitrary power of removal legislation
has been hiaten, forced to be withdrawn
in the Assembly and smothered to death
in the Senate after the lightning stroke
of Senator Ro well's motion to strike out
the enacting clause of the hospital bill.
The flagrant abuse arising out of section
19 of the lunacy bill of 1597. making cer
tain officials practically hold for life, un
der a late decision of the Supreme Court,
has been corrected by the repeal of that
section and the Governor is thereby given
the power in a legitimate way to correct
the evils that had arisen under that sec-
Certain other legislation, including that
for the benefit of San Francisco harbor,
was passed without objection. Vhe chief
object of the sessionâ the election of a
second United States Senatorâ was con
sidered on a plane so high and was so
successful in the outcome that the people
will cheerfully pay the $30,000 that the
session has cost. The splendid record of
this extra session is a complete reversal
of ajl former extra session experiences in
this State.
INDIAN GIRL SOLD FOR
THREE HUNDRED PONIES
Auctioned Off for the Third Time and
Offers a Reward to Any One Who
Special Dispatch to Tha Call
WICHITA. Kans.. Feb. i.-M!ss Mary Corndropper. an Osage Indian girl,
was sold at auction at her. home on the Osage Reservation last week ror tne
sum of 800 ponies. She was led off by an old buck, who will make her nis
slave and wife. The girl sends an appeal to American people to rescue ncr
from her fate and says she has 1200 acres of land, which she will give to tnÂ«
person who saves her.
This makes the third time Miss Corndropper has been sold, and she says
her heart is nearly broken. Her mother, a white woman, died while the girl
was only 16 years of age. and since then the full-blood father has treated her
with no mercy. In all the girl has brought him 600 ponies by her various
sales. The father each time acted as auctioneer and advertised the sale far
and wide among the Indians. ,
Such customs are not against the Indian laws, and the United States
officers offer no objections to such practice. The Indian girl is now 23 years
old and has sent word to white persons living on the border that she will
give her land right in the Osage country to any one who will take her away
from the clutches of her cruel father. - f
SPEAKER ANGERS
THE DEMOCRATS
Radical Application of
Reed Rules.
WASHINGTON, Feb. Â».â There was a
scene at the night session of the House to
night which momentarily recalled the
stirring and exciting days of the Fifty
first Congress. An irate member rushed
down the main aisle, brandishing his arms
and shouting for recognition, -while half
the Democratic members were on their
feet, execrating the occupant of the chair
for what they termed his arbitrary course,
and from several places in the hall came
loud hisses.
Last Friday night Tajbert (D.) of South.
Carolina blocked private pension legisla
tion necause- there was no quorum present
and threatened to . continue to do so at
every subsequent Friday night session un
less a quorum were present. His warn
ing had Its effect. There was an unusu
ally large attendance when the House was
called to order at 8 o'clock to-night.
Speaker Henderson himself was In the
chair, and the galleries, usually empty at
night sessions, were crowded in anticipa
tion ot a lively time.
Talbfert maintained his threat as soon as
the motion was made to go into commltfe
of the whole, but the roll-call showed the
presence of a score or more cf members in
excess of a quorum. The friends of pri
vate pension biils were jubilant. Hep
burn (R.) of lowa was called to preside
over Ihe committee of the whole, and the
clerk read the first bill. Talbert arose
leisurely while the bill was being put
through the legislative stages, the adop
tion of committee amendments, engross
ment, third reading and final passage, and
addressed the chair. He was completely
ignored. Another bill was read, engrossed,
read a third time and passed, all In the
bpace of a minute, with Talbert still clam
oring for recognition. A third bill was
passed in the same way.
By this time the whole Democratic side
was aroused. A dozen members were on
their feet. Talbert, thoroughly angered.

approached. He reached the area In front
of the Speaker's rostrum, all the while
roaring cut his denunciation of the chair
man's arbitrary course, before the chair
man condescended to recognize him. The
Democrats all about were ' also asserting
their disapproval. The Republicans
seemed to enjoy the storm which the
chairman's course had raised.
Talbert rapidly cooled down after he
had been recognized and explained in a
brief speech that the presence of a quorum
had completely vindicated his position.
He had no feeling against the men who
served on the Federal side in the civil
war, but he was opposed to loose, reckless
unconstitutional methods. He suggested
that the House set aside a day each month
for pension legislation and discontinue the
night sessions.
. Sins ID.) of Tennessee, who is Inter
ested in Southern war claims, made some
caustic remarks in criticism of the Repub
lican leaders for sidetracking those "just
obligat'ons" of the Government in favor
of pension bills.
The committee then proceeded with the
consideration of pension bills, and thirty
five were favorably acted upon. At 10:30
the House adjourned. â¢

the unanimous consent to vote on the bill
next Thursday to secure a vote at an

Hoar disclaimed any such effort, calling
attention to the fact that the pending

on Privileges and Elections, said:
. "If the Senator from Tennessee. Mr.

refrained from pressing the case, as I
was informed that all the time would be
taken by the financial bill: but If the Sen

pending bill I will ask the Senator (Mr.

Resistance was offered. The robber fired
twice at his victims, one of the bullets
taking effect in Sommerfeldt's arm.

Secretary Hay has openly stated that it
would be better to leave the' British
treaty as it stands than to have it amend
ed. President McKinley entirely agrees
with him, and Senator Davis, chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations, at
the conference at the White House to
day was told that no amendments would
be acceptable to the administration. Sen
ator Davis assured the President that he
was convinced that the treaty would be
passed as it had left Secretary Hay's
hands.
Senator Morgan also assured the Presi
dent that the treaty is in no danger. He
said it was a matter of great importance
that the treaty should be ratified and
provision made for beginning work on the
canal. ' .
"There U always a lot of mouthing
about anything Great Britain has a hand
In." Senator Morgan said, "but there is
not suflicient reason for it this time. I
see that one of the main grounds against
the treaty is that in case of war ships of
the enemy could go through the canal and
attack the Pacific Coast. Where would
our ships be all this time? Running away
or fighting? Why. they could pick their
ground for a fight anywhere, and for that
matter could stay in the canal itself and
do their fighting."
Many of the diplomats stationed in
Washington have called on Secretary Hay
and have assured htm that the passage
of the treaty would be most acceptal-le
to their home Governments.
It is understood that President McKln
ley is so deeply impressed with the deplor
able condition of Hawaii that he is con
templating a special message to Congress,
in which he will review the situation as it
exists In the islands and will earnestly

2MINERS DISCHARGED.
Hundreds Thrown Out of Employ-
ment in British Colombia.
ROSSLAND. B. C. Feb. S.-The mining
community is in a condition of genuine
consternation, owing to the discharge to
day of 100 men by the Le Roi Mining
Company, and the announcement from
Nelson that the Hall mines and smelter
had also shut down to-day on account of
the enforcement of the eight-hour law for
underground mining.
Following so quickly after the partial
shutdown of the War Eagle and the Cen
ter Star, these further cases of cessation
Â«f mining operations has created dismay
in both mining and business circles. Un
fortunately, too, there is said to be a
probability of still further Instances of
wholesale discharges and shutting down
before the middle of the present month. :

Dr." Stryker eulogized General Lawton's
military career and went on to say:
This better Plantasenet. this latest Bayard,
"without fear and without reproach." this
modern Phllio Sidney, whose life was also
"poetry put into action," has shown once more
of what etuff ts Incorrigible manhoodâ ln what
substinc* root the memories that last.

Here was cne whom Raleigh. Gustavus Adol

was of that time-enduring breed which haÂ«

Duty is in the imperative and unconditional
mood. When, In the 'name of mankind. , and.
that peace might be real, we undertook in 189s
to cleanse the eeas we affirmed a principle, and
made a precedent that I, for one, hold to have
written the most honorable leaf in all our his
tory. But all that has been since was corrolary
to that. No special pleading of professional
malcontents with whom wisdom will not die. no
a priori abstraction, can unsay what this dead
soldier's teal did for America, Rather does
such a death enjoin upon our purpose and per
formance such ends as ehall vindicate uÂ« from
cowardly indifferentlsm and evasion in r the

pected or complex, enjoin us to regard and to
teach liberty's authority.

A dozen troopers, as the doctor closed,
lifted the flower-laden coffin and bore it

wheels and clash of trace chains, came
the guns, field batteries and siege trains.
Ahead of the scores of carriages was the
flag-draped, flower-laden caisson, the ideal
soldier's bier, and behind it was led the
officer's charger in a shroud of black,
with the boots reversed in the stirrups, a
picturesque remnant of superstition in
this materialistic day of machine guns

EVIDENCE REGARDING
GOEBEL'S ASSASSINATION
FRANKFORT. Ky., Feb. ?.â The
authorities expect to obtain important
evidence regarding the assassination of
Governor Goebel, from Silas Jones, who
v.as arrested this morning. Jones has al
ready made a partial confession. He de
clares that he personally knows nothing
OX the crime, but gays that ilarlan Y\"hlt
taxer, who *as arrestei Â¦ immediately
after the shooting while running from the
executive building, from v/liich the shots
were fired, knows a great deal about the
crime. It is believed that Jones gave more
information than that regarding Whit
tiker. and that what he told tne police
may leaa to further arrests in the neigh
borhood of Richmond, Madison County,
Kentucky.
John Gottschalk of Nelson County, who
V.&S arrested with Jones, was released
from custody to-mpht.
Gottschalk and J-jr.es an* cousins. The
latter says he came with ihe mountaineer
excursion. Both are said to have slept
in the executive building the n:Â«nt belorc
G'lebt.l was assas.-lnated. Jones pays he
applied to Taylor and F'.nley for pay lor
coming here. He says this was promised
him by others in advance, but they would
rot settle and he could not get out of
town. He sayp he did not know what he
was brought here for. Although the de
tective? have been examining and cross
examining Jones all afternoon and even
ing, outsiders have not fc^eri permitted to
see or talk to him. The detective? believe
this to be the mo<=t complete arrest yet
made. Jor.es is said to have been sleeping
in a vacant house, only coming our at
night, and had b*en here for a week prior
to the assassination.

BUCK PLAGUE
STUMPED OUT
No New Cases Develop
at Honolulu.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Can.
HONOLULU. Feb. 2.â Seven d*ays have
elapsed since we. have had a case of the
plague or even a suspicious case, so that
even our very cautious and conservative
medical men enteraln ho^Â°s that the dan
ger Is at an end. This Is due to the dras
tic measures that have been taken In de
stroying by fire nearly half of the busi
ness portion of the cityâ that is. China
townâand removing no less than seven
eights of the total Asiatic population and
all the Hawaiians who were In touch with
the infected districts into well ordered
camps of detention.
So far not a single suspicious case has
been reported from any of the plantations
or from any of the other Islands. The
epidemic confined itself almost entirely to
the Asiatic- quarters, and they are no
more.
The Government feels much relieved at
President McKinley*s approval of the
Council of State appropriating money to
combat the plague, and now that the au
thorization Is complete the work of sani
tation In the destroyed districts will . bo
carried to a completion, and from the
ruins and ashes of Chinatown will arise
a new city more worthy of the flag under
which Hawaii now nestles.
It la the intention of the Board of
Health to be on the safe side, and to that
end a strict quarantine will be kept up for
some time to come. If no other cases ap
pear in a week there may be a relaxation
of the rules as they affect travel and pub
lic gatherings. There will hardly be a
disposition to raise the quarantine under
fourteen days or more, though this may
be declared a clean port before that time.
President C. B. Wood reports that the
total number of deaths from bubonic

BEGGED TO BE
SENT TO PRISON
Burglar Wished to Break
the Drug Habit.
?
Special Dispatch to The Call
BAN JOSE. Feb. S.-Walter Kellogg, a
cocaine fiend, stood before Judge Lorigan
of the Superior Court to-day and begged
to be committed to Folsom prison that he
might free himself from the enslaving
drug. It was the time set down for the
sentencing of Kellogg on a charge of
burglary, to which he had pleaded guilty.
He had robbed five different houses, and
in each case his loot consisted of lead
pipe, which he tore out from under sinks.
The pipe was disposed of to Junk men
through two small boys, Willie Fernandez
and Albert Donovan, and the proceeds
were used to purchase cocaine.
Since his arrest, Kellogg has asked to
be sent to State prison, and to-day he
made his appeal to the Judge. He stated
he was S3 years of age, and a native of
California. This was his first arrest for
crime. Six years ago he became addicted
to opium, then morphine arid now cocaine.
Kellogg has a wife and two children. At
one time his wife secured a divorce from
him. but through, desire to reform him
Ehe had remarried him. He told Judge
Lorigan he had secured a hundred-day
sentence in the County Jail at Stockton to
cure himself of morphine and had broken
off the drug, but taking to drinking the
desire for a stronger stimulant returned to
him. Kellogg asked that he be given a
year in Folsom. In that time he would
be thoroughly cured of the habit, and af
ter he was discharged he would devote the
balance of his life to rescuing fellow suf
ferer* from the opium, morphine and
cocaine habits.
Judge Lorigan looked at the unfortun
ate man's plight in a kindlier way. He
said he did not believe In sending a man
to State prison to cure him of such a
habit, as the stigma of being a convict
would always be attached to him. He
continued the sentencing of Kellogg for
one week, and It ia probable he will only
be given a six months' term In the County
Jail.
Willie Fernandez and Albert Donovan,
aj?ed 14 and 16. who disposed of Kellogg's
loot, were arraigned before Justice Rosen
thai to-day on a charge of burglary. Their
examination was set for February 12. The
boys will probably be sent to the Whittler
Reform School.

the lowering winter day for a glimpse
of the flag-draped caisson with Its mili
tary escort as it passed through the
streets. Hundreds more made the toll-
Borne pilgrimage to Arlington to hear the
last words pronounced above the open
grave, where President, Cabinet and the
general commanding the army stood with
bowed heads until the last volley had
been fired and the bugle sounded "taps."
It was the home-coming of a hero. For
seven weeks, ever since the : sad news
from San Mateo had been flashed around
the width of the world, the country had
waited to pay its best tribute to the dead.
Lawton. to the great bulk of Ameri
cans, had been the incarnation of the
American soldier. He had made his mark
in the Civil War from the Mississippi to
the sea, and in the interval of potential
peace it was he who had beaten at his
own game Geronimo, the greatest master
of desert craft j and mountain fighting
that the West had ever known; it was h
who, in the new problems of a tropic war,
had proved the most daring and re
sourceful of all the generals in the field.
It was in tribute to these qualities that
the Lawton fund had in a few weeks
been swelled past all the expectations of
its originators, for America knew that
Lawton, having been a soldier first and
only, had left to those who loved him no
heritage save his fame and a spotless
name.
For a day and night the body of the
soldier lay in state in the Church of the
Covenant. So it lay this morning when
the doors were opened, troopers from his
old command, with sabers drawn, keep
ing vigil at the head and foot. Beneath
the soft lights of the altar arose a tropi
cal Jungle of palms, and higher
than the flag-draped cofOn arose
banks of flowers, tributes from every
quarter of the land. At his head hung
In dim folds the dingy battle flag from
San Mateo, still on its bamboo staff and
supported by one of the men who was
near him when he fell. From the ceiling
hung the red-centered flag of the Eighth
Corps, under which he had won perpet
ual fame in two island wars. About him.
as the shrill pipes of the organ trembled
with the opening anthem, stood grouped
his superiors, and his brother officer;*,
with whom and for whom his life work
Bad been done.
i Close to the coffin sat President Me-
Klnley and on his right the Secretary of
State. With them were the Secretary of
War, the Attorney General, the Secre
tary of the Navy, 'the Postmaster Gen
eral, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of the Interior and the Secre
tary of Agriculture. Close by were Mrs.
Lawton. little Manley and the others of
the family, and to the left General Miles,
General Merritt. General Brooke. General
Shatter and their staff oGlcers, all In uni
form, and all Lawton's comrades who at
one time or another had camped and
fought with him. In the body of the
church was a scarcely less notable gath
ering â assistant secretaries and heads of
bureaus; the military committees of the
House and Senate; diplomats, the Ori
entals In their flowing robes of somber
color and the Europeans resplendent in
decorations, among them the Spanish
Minister. There were delegations from
the Loyal Legion, the Grand Army and
other patriotic societies.
Chaplain Pierce of Lawton's old com
mand read the Presbyterian burial ser
vice, that epistle to the Corinthians,
whose words of comfort seem freshly
pruned for each occasion of bereavement.
Then President Stryker of Hamilton Col
lege, New York, clad In his divinity robes,
arose to deliver the oration. He had been
selected personally by the Secretary of
War, who knew his titness for the task.
The choice was amply Justified. Seldom
has any ceremony called forth a tribute
more scholarly and eloquent, more sim
ple and direct and more appropriate and
ritting to the occasion. Dr. Stryker said
in part:
Over the width of the earth a. soldier's house
bold'has broueht its warrior home. The du?t
that the nation gathers to its euardlne is that
of no common man. We are met to celebrate
and mourn him. Bat while we recall the record
co compact with manliness and which the white
blossom of ' modesty crowns withal, while we
recite the story of one who personified the
best American traditions, first this day do we
regard her sorrow who treads that "solemn
aisle of pain" the sanctity of whose shadows
are accessible only to her God. ,
Hither have we comeâ the people's chosen
head and all authorities else from their high
several sessionsâ to pay our poor but tender
alms of love -to an unblemished memory, to
thank him who is our dwellin* place in all

yields such manner of fruitage and to pledge
ourselves, considerior the issue of lives of our
renowned dead, to Â¦ imitate their - unblemished
and unblirhted Â¦ faith. -Â»"4fiRWHWniBO3KWa

.
LOS ANGELES. F*h. ?.â A committee
from the Southern â¢â¢aiifornia Forest ar.d
Water Association called on I'nited States
Senator Bard at h!s home this morning
ar.d explained the outlines of the proposed
measure for protecting the Southern Cali
fornia forest reserves from fire and the
reforestnzation of t*e districts that have
been burned, computed at 15 square miles.
The difficulty for restoration was shown
in the fact that ihc Department of Agri
culture has the custody of the forest re
serves. wh.il*: the Department of the Inte
rior supervises the lands remaining un
sold, making it incumbent to deal with
two departments, with the result that har
mony never prevails. Senator Bard ex
pressed himself as being fuiiy impressed
with the importance of this vexed quea
tron. and when Informed that the work of
planting 57.000 ptne seeds by private par
ties was just completed in the Sierra
Madre Mountains, he said he would ask
the co-operation of the departments and
obtain an annual appropriation of at least
$3>'*X> for reforestrizaticn.
Senator Bard has consented to become
the guest of honor at the annual banquet
of the Chamber of Commerce on Wash
ington's Birthday. It is expected that at
that time he will speak upon a subject of
national importance.
Senator Bard left for San Francisco on

Sixteen Deaths Aboard the Hos
pital Ship on.tlie Vopge From
Manila to Honolulu.
HONOLULU. Feb. 2.â The conditions on i
board the hospital ship Missouri show
that the soldier who Is struck by a Fill
pino bullet Is luckier than the man whose
system becomes inoculated with thÂ« dis- j
ease germs of the Philippine cumate. i
Nearly all of the 272 soldiers on board
the vessel are sick and the most of them
are suffering with dysentery- The sixteen
who died between here and Manila are
not the only ones of the lot that left i
the scene of war who will never see home j
again. Three or four others are almost j
certain to succumb before San Francisco j
Is reached.
"The wounded at Manila generally do j
very well." said Captain William L.
Kneedler. executive officer of the ship, t
"and most of them recover sufficiently to j
be sent home on the transports. For that i
reason most of our passengers are sick J
men. Dysentery and consumption are the j
two diseases that are making the great
est ravages. Consumption Is very bad in !
Manila. When it gets hold of the system j
it makes most extraordinary progress.
Some of those we cave lost would have
recovered if they could have been moved ,
away from the Islands. ,
"The victims of dysentery are more nu
merous than consumptives, and the dl - j
ease is almost equally incurable. It has
a bacillus, like the plague here, and no
treatment, diet or climatic change seems
to affect many of the cases. It is abso
lutely as necessarily fatai as a malignant ;
case of car.cer. We have held post-mor- i
tens on some of the victims that died on j
the vessel and found that the membranes,
of the stomach were r.:ne-tenth3 eaten '
away."
On the deck of the Missouri are many
m"n whose face? show the ravages of j
consumption or dysentery. Sine? reaching i
the vicinity of Honolulu and having fine j
weather they are able to sit on th* deck. !
but sorce of them cannot recover an>l a I
large number will never be fit for active j
service again. Men who onljÂ» about a .
year ago were able to pa?s the rigid mcdi- j
cal examinations for enlistment are now
certain Invalids for life. They will be fit
candidates for places on Lncle Sams
pension list. Quarantine prevents the peo
ple of Honolulu from snowing the sym
pathy and attention they would like to
display, but Mrs. S. M. Damon has sent
a large quantity of fruits and flowers, for
which Caotain Kneedler expresses the
warmest thanks.
Just before leaving the Philippines Cap
tain Kneedler made a tour of Southern
Luzon with General Young. The condi
tions there show a complete cessation of
war's activities.
"I found the people perfectly contented
and engaged in their agricultural pur
suits." said the captain, "and they arÂ»
very prosperous. Splendid crops are- being
raised and many cattle and there were*
no signs that the Filipinos were not sat
isfied with the new order of affairs. Aa
far as this whole district is concerned
the trouble seems to be at an end. la
Northern Luzon there Is still some, rebel
lion, but an active campaign is begun
and the whole war Is very likely to bÂ«
dore with in short order.
"Manila itself is quiet and prosperous.
There is absolutely no sign of disturbance
there. I was amazrt at the amount of
work that has been done toward making
the place sanitary. The town ia in a re
markably clean condition."
The Missouri has teen called thÂ© flr.est
hospital ship in the world and is really
splendidly fitted up for the care of the
sick and wounded. She has her own.
plants for the making cf ice. sada. for
disinfection, etc.. and operating room*
that are in every way up to modern re
quirement?. When she was purchased by
the Government during the Spanish war
gifts of all sorts of apparatus and other
r.eeds were sÂ«nt to her by various Amer
ican societies. She was originally loaned
to the Government for a year, free of
ail charge and with all expenses paid, by
the Atlantic Transportation Company.
and was afterward bought for JISO.COO.
The Missouri will pr^bablv not get away
till Friday morr.lr.g. Work is kept up 111

robbed on the evening of October 31. Three were impli
cated in this robberyâ Downing, Scott and Lynch.
The next case was that of the Alameda power-house.
On the afternoon of November 4, the day of the robbery.
Downing and Scott went to Alameda and spent a consid
erable period of time reccnnoiterlng. They asked so many
questions about the number of men on duty at night that
they attracted some attention and the power-house em
ployes have 6ince identified Downing and the picture of
Scott as those of the men who asked the questions.
Downing admits this in his confession and says that
Lynch and Foute were implicated in the robbery.
The crooks then stole a boat on the Alameda water
front and rowed across the estuary to the Market-street
wharf, where they landed, going to Coyne's saloon at
Fifth and Peralta streets, where they held up the pro
prietor and secured $SO. The Alameda power-house at
tempt accurred at 10:30 o'clock and the Coyne robbery at
11:15 of the same night. Downing, in his confession, ad
mits each case. . , .
They only rested four days after the Coyne robbery and
then came the fatal Thomas shooting. The gang tried
to hold up John Thomas in the saloon of Thomas & Bap
tlste, at the corner of Campbell and Pacific streets. In
stead of holding- up his hands Thomas made for the men,
one of whom opened fire.
Downing admitted that he was connected with this rob
bery, but denied that he fired the shot that killed the
faloon keeper. Chief Hodgkins believes that the missing
Lynch was the actual murderer of Thomas and there is
a suspicion that the chief has something in the confession
of Downing to back his belief. At any rate Lynch left
the country five days after the Thomas shooting and has
not been seen since.
Scott was found in a boxcar on the night of the
Thomas shooting. He had thrown his revolver away and
after being held for two days, was Â¦ released, having
convinced the police he was only a hobo. Scott then went
to Bakersfield, where he was arrested for robbing a saloon
He is now serving seven years in San:Quentln for the
crime. That left two vacancies In the gang and they
were filled by Charles McCoy and Fred Dannaker. Mc-
Coy came from Montana, where he has a reputation of
being a hard man. He was to have been the new captain
of the gang. They tried several smaller Jobs and were
captured In the gunstore robbery. Downing* confessed and
in the hone of getting Lynch and Foute, McCoy, Down
ing and Dannaker were permitted to plead guilty to at
tempted burglary. Foute was arrested at his house in
East Oakland. He takes his arrest coolly and refuses to
talk to tho police or any one else.
This Is the story told by Chief of Police Hodgkins of
one of the hardest gangs ever got together.
Members of the other gang that operated in Oakland
and shot Butcher Robert Vincent, though they may never
suffer for that crime, have been sentenced to suffer for
another. A dispatch from Sacramento Is to the effect that
Superior Judge Hart has sentenced Henry Spellman to
thirty-five . years in the penitentiary at Folsom and A B
Spellman to thirty years' imprisonment at the same place
for having, with one R. M. Gordon, held up and robbed
a citizen named John A. Mills near Capitol Park last
Sunday night.
The evidence gathered by the police was of such defi
nite character that the men deemed.lt expedient to con
fess their crime. Gordon has turned out to be an escaped
life termer from Illinois, and he will be returned to the
Jollet prison to serve out his sentence.
The two Spellmans, who are not brothers, by the
way, and who have aliases, were held to answer in the
lower court this morning. This afternoon they conceived
the idea that they would get off more lightly if they
went before Judge Hart. . owned . up to their crime, and
asked for immediate sentence.
Judge Hart informed the prisoners that their' act
strongly appealed to his magnanimity, and, therefore in
stead of giving them life imprisonment, which he said they
â¢ deserved, he sentenced Henry Spellman to thirty-five
years' imprisonment and A. B. Spellman to thirty. In
passing judgment. Judge Hart remarked that any man
who used a slungshtot on -'a pedestrian in order to rob
him of his valuables would not stop at murder to accom
plish his purpose, or to overcome resistance, and It had'
been and would continue to be his policy to regard rob
bery as only slightly less serious a crime than murder.

In conversation yesterday Mr. Morton
said that he has every reason to congrat
ulate his company on the business It has
done during the last year. Everything
has increased, particularly in the passen

more thoroughly every day the superior
claims possessed by California as a win
te"r resort and as a State that has many
attractions to offer to the health seeker
and the Eiphts^elnj? tourist." This realiza
lon has manifested Itself during the past
year in an increase of travel that has run
almost a quarter above the volume done in
previous years, and, from the looks of
things it is almost certain that the people
carried over the different "Western roads
this year will outnumber those of the
year just past as greatly as these have
outnumbered their predecessors.
Mr. Morton and his party will leave
here during the early part of the week for
Los Angeles, where they will meet J. C.

OAKLAND, Feb. 9.â T^ie mystery of the killing of
John Thomas, the saloon keeper who was shot
at West Oakland by the men who tried to hold
him up, has been solved, out solved in such a way
that the men who did the killing will never be brought
to Justice for their crime. Some of them are already suf
fering for other crimes. One has escaped, probably gone
from the State, and one is held by the police in the Oak
land City Prison in the hope that something may be fas
tened upon him that will give him some measure of the
punishment he deserves.
While, however, the men may never be punished for the
murder of Thomas, one of the hardest gangs of criminals
that ever got together in the State of California has been
broken up.
It was this gang that did most of the shooting and rob
bing that ha* occurred in the city of Oakland for the
past six monthsâ all of the work, in fact, except tho
shooting of Butcher Robert Vincent. * That was probably
done by the men sentenced yesterday at Sacramento. One
â W. J. Downingâ is now doing five years from this coun
ty for attempted burglary; anotherâ Ed Scottâ ls doing
seven years for burglary from Kern County; stUI an
otherâFred Fouteâ !* at present in the Oakland City
Prison. The worst one of the gang, "Brick" Lynch, has
escaped. Two other members of the pang, Henry McCoy
and Fred Daunakcr, who are not parties to the killing of
Thomas, but who helped In other work, are serving five
years and three years, respectively, from this county on
pleas of guilty to charges of attempted burglary.
Chief of Police St. Clair Hodpklns handled the case In
all its details. The investigation consumed fully three
months' hard work. Unfortunately there were no wit
nesses to the killing of Thomas except; the men implicat
ed and no conviction could ever have been had, so much
of this work has gone for nothing.
Ever since the killing- of Thomas, November 12 of last
y*ar. and the preceding robberies Chief of Police HodÃ
kins has been at work. Not until the capture of Down
ing, McCoy and Dannaker last month for thÂ»Â» attempted
robbery of Orsars gun store on Seventh street was any
thing made sure. Chief Hodgklns knew that he had part
of the gang, but wanted to get the remainder. He final
ly exacted a confession from Downing, which confession
was the basis for the arrest of Foute, It aJso implicated
Lynch. Downing confirmed much that before was only
suspected. He admitted complicity in the Thomas killing
but eaJd that he did not fire the shot. Lynch Is believed
to be the man who pulled the trigger. Dawning also told
the story of other hold-ups and robberies. To get tho
men not already in Jail wai the next move. Foute was
arrested, but Lynch escaped and is now probably beyond
fear of capture.
The formation of this gang begran far back In Nebraska,
when Ed Scott, an Eastern crook, met Fred Foute, an
Oakland boy. who had pone wrong. Foute had been sent
to the Whittier Reform School, escaped and went to
Texas. From there he went to Garfield County. Colorado,
Â¦where he cracked the safe of the County Treasurer, se
cured $600. was convicted and served five years in the Col
orado State Prison under the name of Thomas Williams.
He was discharged August 27, IK<3, and joined Scott in
Nebraf-ka.
The two went to Trinidad, Col., where they did several
pieces of work. Scott was arrested, but escaped prosecu
tion, and the two separated to meet In Sacramento in Oc
tober. There they met Lynch and it is known that Lynch
was implicated in several jobs there. Lynch had only
just been released from the County Jail, where he had
Â¦erred six months for robbing a saloon at the corner of
Second and O Btreete. He escaped a sentence of ten
years, which had been Imposed for this crime, by a rever
sal of his case by the Supreme Court.
They all went to San Fianciseo, where they were joined
by Downing, who came from Montana, where he had
served time. Foute and Downing both came from Oakland
oiipinally and thf>y turned the attention of the gang
apair.st their former home.
The first job they undertook here was that of Chrlsten

CONTRACT GOES
TO THE HIGHEST
OF TWO BIDDERS
Colonel Long Makes a
Peculiar Ruling.
Â¦There is trouble) In- store for Colonel Os
car Long of the- United States quarter
master department In this city unless the
Chicago Great Western people recede
from their present intention or he is able
to explain why he favors the highest bid
der on a transportation contract.
Some time ago the Government decided
to send East seventy-four men belonging
to the transport Thomas, and the quarter
master's department in this city was or
dered to call for bids for their transpor
tation from the different railroad com
panies. Only two companies respondedâ
the Southern Pacific and the Chicago
Great Western. Mr. Donaldson presented
the bids on behalf of the Southern Pacific,
while C. O. Johnson offered the figures
for the Chicago Great Western people.
The regular fare from here to New York
is $66 40. The Southern Pacific ofTered to
convey the men to their -destination for
$62 03 and the Chicago Great Western of
fered to undertake the same job for $58 20.
The Southern Pacific was awarded the
contract, notwithstanding- the difference
in favor of the other road.
No one has attempted to explain the in
fluence that decided Colonel Long to place
the contract where he did; no one accuses
him of anything that is not just right:
but as the proceeding Is certainly out of
the ordinary the Chicago Great Western
people think they have r grievance which
should be rectified. They are mad clear
through, and unless Colonel Long sees fit
to make some explanation which shall
prove satisfactory it is not unlikely that
he will have charges preferred against
him with the department at Washington.
The amount involved in the transporta
tion of ' this particular batch of men Is
not in itself very great nor is It large
enough, taken alone, to make any great
fuss about. Such a sum. when taken In
connection with the volume of business
done by either of the roads interested. Is
comparatively trivial. But the Govern
ment will have other men to transfer
across the continent in the days to come,
and If this first affair is allowed to pass
without question there Is no telling where
the matter will stop or to what extent the
United States will be forced to unjustly
enrich the already overflowing coffers of
Collis P. Huntlr.gton.
REMEMBERED A
FACE AND GOT
BACK HIS COIN
+
Episode at California-
Street Station.
, Whpn.John White, a, resident. of Colu
sa County, departed from the California
street police station last night he consid
ered that he had been born under a
lucky star." A check for $500, which rep
resented his accumulations of wealth for
ten years; had been recovered for him
by. Officer Kramer after he had given up
all hope of ever possessing it again.
White's story is a strange one and re
lates an instance in which his memory
for faces served him to good advantage.
He claims that he came to San Francisco
about a week ago with nearly $1000 in his
possession. Four hundred dollars of this
amount was coin and the balance was in
the form of a check. He started out to
see the sights and while making a tour
over Barbary Coast spent much money
and consumed a large amount of liquor.
Late Wednesday night he was still cele
brating and the $400 in coin had nearly
all been spent. He finally drifted into
the Cascade saloon on Sacramento street,
near Kearny, where he finished his
night s dissipation. Before departing he
gave the check for the $600 into the keep
ing of the bartender of the place and was
put to bed in a stupid condition by some
friends, who afterward met him.
When he awoke next morning he felt for
his check, but it had disappeared. Ha
finally remembered that he had given it to
some one to keep for him, but all recol
lection of the location of that person w.-ia
dimmed. He gave the piece of valuable
paper up for lost and telegraphed to the
president of the Colusa bank, on which
it had been drawn, to stop its payment.
Last night White entered the Cascade
saloon for the purpose of getting a <lrJnk.
He did not remember that he had ever
been in the place 'before, and when the
drink had been served to him he called
for a piece of papor on which to write a
note. While engaged in doing this he
studied the face of the bartender, and sud
denly a vague recollection came to him
that he was the party with whom the
check had been deposited. A few minutes
later, in company with Police Officer J.
H. Kramer of the California-street police
station, he returned to the place and his
wealth was turned over to the officer.
Sergeant Christianson will keep the
check until. White sobers up and calls for
it in the morning.

NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â Joe Gans, the
Baltimore lightweight pugilist, gained a
well earned decision over "Spike" Sullivan
of Boston in the fourteenth round of a
bout at the lightweight limit before the
Broadway Athletic Club to-night. From
the start the fight was a hard one, and
Sullivan at times looked like a winner, but
the negro outpointed him in leading and

Gans was equal to the occasion. Buili

DALY'S FINE SHOWING.
Keeps Champion Frank Erne Busy
During Their Bout
CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â A decision on points
at the end of the sixth round was the
best Frank Erne, the lightweight cham
pion, could do with "Chicago" Jack Daly
in the fight at the Fort Dearborn Ath
letic Club to-night. Daly realized in the
first round that he had no show with his
opponent at long-range fighting and made
a hurry-up affair of it, trusting to luck
more than to science to land a knockout
blow. '
These tactics seemed to worry Erne for
the first three rounds. Daly was the
stronger of the two and in the clinches
managed to land some heavy Jolts on the
stomach. There were three or four mlxups
in each round. Daly Bent as good as ne
got, until the fourth, when Erne caught
him on the Jaw with a heavy left swing
that staggered him and brought blood.
After that until the end of the fight Erno
was able to jab Daly as often as he
pleased, but the latter continued to bore
In and mix It at every opportunity.
In the fifth Daly closed Erne's left eye
with a right swing. Erne had orders in
the last round to finish Daly If possible.
The champion tried with all his might,
but Daly would not give an Inch. Erne
would Jab Daly's head back with the left
and then cross the right over for the jaw,
but Daly was game and stood up to the
punishment. Is ear the end of the round
he Just missed Erne's Jaw with a left
swing that would have put the latter out
of business.. Daly Bllpped from* the .'lm
petus of his own blow and Erne caught
him squarely on the Jaw with a right up
percut that came near putting Daly out.
Both men were on their feet at the finish,
in a fierce exchange, with Erne having a
slight advantage.
Daly's showing surprised his most
ardent admirers and the decision was very
unsatisfactory to the majority of the spec
tators, who thought it should have been
calledÂ»a draw.
In the preliminaries Â¦ Maurice .Rauch
knocked out George Brown (colored) in
the fifth round, and George Stead, better
known as Ole Olesen, was given the de
cision over Charlie Mason at the end of
the sixth round.
McFADDEN THE WINNER.
His Fight With Murray Develops
Into a Wrestling Matchl
BALTIMORE, Feb. 9. â The return
match between George McFadden of New
York and Jimmy Murray of Cincinnati
to-night was awarded to the former In the
middle of the ninth round. As on the for
mer occasion when these boxers met in
this city, the bout ; degenerated Into a
wrestling match, and at times resembled
a rough-and-tumble fight. The referee
was compelled to use force repeatedly to
get tlie men apart, and in the fifth roun J
the police stopped the fight; but, on a
promise to break clean and cease wrest
ling, the men were allowed to go on. Dur
inj? the .remainder of the bout Murray
was floored a half-dozen times by McFad
don, but after taking the count came up
each time.

mJll, Olen Park, the racetrack, the Velo

Â¦ It was ' the wish of the Eastern men to
have the fight take place between April
10 and 15. but as this was Holy Week the
local managers notified their correspond
ents and the latter settled upon the 25th
lnstas the most suitable for the contest.
Manager. Gibbs. stated last evening, that
the fight would in all probability, be held
on that date. Personally he thought the
Ist of May would be most suitable for the
conflict, as it was a semi-holiday. 'It was
pointed out to him by a friend that it was
Dewey. day, and the patriotic , people
might object to the fight on the anniver
sary of the battle of Manila Bay, as did
the Irish societies when the Corbett-Fitz
eimmons fight wan held In Carson on St.-
Patrick's day. Manager Gibbs thought
that Dewey day would be the most suita

battle fought on that day.

4MANAGERS ARE
PREPARING FOR
LEAGUE GAMES
Four Clubs Will Play Profes
sional Baseball on This
Coast This Season.
During the coming week the California
Baseball League will organize for the
forthcoming season. Last year there were
six clubs in the league at the outset, but
in the middle of the season the cut came
and from that time to the end there wer.e
but four. San Jose and Watsonville were
dropped for financial reasons, the best
players of these teams finding places in
the four that remained.
When the games begin this spring four
teams will comprise the league. At pres
ent San Francisco and Oakland are the
clubs that have organized and will surely
play. Sacramento and Stockton have the
best chances for representation so far.
Krlpp of the capital city will not manage
the club this season, but as there are
three or four men anxious to secure the
franchise he will have no difficulty In dis
posing of his interest.
On Thursday Harry Harris and Cal
Ewing visited Sacramento for the purpose
of a conference with the prospective man
agers of the Sacramento nine. They came
away satisfied that all would be well with
the champions of last season. The choice
of the fourth club lies among Santa Cruz,
Vallejo and Stockton. The Stockton peo
ple are enthusiastic over the prospect of
entering the league and will use every
effort to place a nine in the fleld. The
only hitch possible depends upon the ques
tion of grounds. At present the manager
of the Stockton team is at work with the
street railroad companies of that city in
order to Induce them to prepare grounds
for baseball purposes. This has been
promised. If consummated Stockton will
be the fourth club of the league.
Cal Ewing has organized his nine, but
there may be one or two changes before
the season begins. Harris is canvassing
the field. After the meeting in this city
early in the week all the managers will be
reaching for material and by the first of
next month the nines will be out for prac
tice.

AS SWIMMERS
Scott Leary of the Polytechnic
Wins the Quarter and Half
Mile Championships.
Scott Leary, a student at the Polytech
nic High . School, carried off the honors
last night in the second annual swimming
championship of the Academic Athletic
Lea-*rue. He won both the quarter and the
half mile races in the Olympic Club's big
tank, showing great staying powers in the
trying contests. Carl Wigholm, also of
the Polytechnic, won the 10Q-yjÂ»rd race,
while Stafford Hamm of the Lowell High
School carried off the honors in the "220."-
The school championship was won by
the Polytechnic, with 21 points. Lowell
had 9, St. Matthew's 3, Oakland 2 and Ala
meda 1.
, Every point of vantage from which the
contests could be viewed was occupied
by spectators. Many of them were stu
dents at schools represented by the young
swimmers and made the big building re
echo with their class yells and with good,
hearty cheers for the successful competi
tors. A number of the Olympians, Includ
ing Champion Sid Cavill, Wallace Taylor,
Lester Hammersmith, Alex Pape, Fen
ton, Carl and others, gave a briiilant ex
hibition of diving. The competitive events
resulted as follows:

At a meeting of the board of governors
of the Pacific Association, Amateur Ath
letic Union, last night the proposed in
door athletic tournament was abandoned.
The college men would not competi im
mediately before their field day nor im
mediately after. This was the only avail
able time, hence the meeting was declared
oft.
E. P. Peterson and Otto Heinz, with two
friends, killed 112 ducks at Mount Eden
last Sunday. The bag was made up of
spooneys and bluebills. with a few "cans"
and teal.

BENCH SHOW PROSPECTS.
. The members of San Francisco Kennel
Club are already hard at work preparing
for the coming spring bench show. It is
conceded that the prospects for a record
breaking show have never been as bright
as they are this year. The purchases of
thoroughbred dogs already exceed in
number those of .ill previous seasons.
The rivalry, among the different specialty
clubs Is of the keenest character and the
special prizes. will be both numerous and
Co6tly. J. L. Langenderfer has been en
raged to act as superintendent of the
Ehow and Dave Sinclair as clerk. .
Richard H. Rountree has sold his well
known bull terrier dog Tabasco to A. C.
Luck of Austin and has replaced Tabasco
with an Eastern importation. Mr. Roun
tree has also bought from Tom Collins
a six-month-old bull terrier dog puppy,
by Admiral, out. of Woodcote Baroness.
E. S. Heller, who lately purchased
from the Redwood Kennels a cocker
spaniel dog puppy, has been compelled to
place the latter In the hands of Dr.-
Steers for treatment.
R. M. Palmer of Seattle has bought
from TV P. Mallorie of . Crozet. Va., a
young Airedale dog puppy named Rus
tic Jerry, by the English champion
Broodland Brushwood, out of Rustic
Peggy.
William 'Gerstle. who recently bought 'a
Boston terrier dog. has had the misfor
tune to lose him within three days of his
arrival. The dog seemed to have taken
a chill on the journey out and - died of
pneumonia. *
James L. Flood has purchased the mas
tiff Myra, by Major, out of Queen Bess
11. for the. purpose of breeding to his
mastiff dog Caesar F, by Roderick Dhu
out of Baby Ruth.
;W. -C. Brown, the noted fancier, has
acquired a Llewellyn puppy by Merrfr
Monarch, out of Hazel C, and has de
clared ; his intention . of winning ; the first
puppy prize in the bench show -with her.

At the last meeting of the San Fran-
cisco Kennel Ciub directors Byron Er-

ON THE TENNIS COURTS.
The. crowning event of winter tennis at
the California club courts, Scott and Bush
streets, will be the ' class tournament
which Is scheduled for Washington's
birthday. It will be a club affair, with a
distinctive social aspect.
At a meeting of the board of directors
during the week It was decided to have a
class tournament, and all contestants will
be classified by "Joe" Daily. George
Whitney will have entire charge of the
tournament. This is an Innovation In the
working of tournaments as pursued by
the California club management. Hitherto
a tournament committee assumed the di
rectorship of all affairs, but more or less
friction resulted. As it is now, Whitney
will be solely responsible for the success
or failure of the tournament.
In order to relntroduce the social ele
ment, luncheon will bo served at the
courts. Invitations will be sent to the
members and a large attendance is ex
pected. The entries will be numerous and
as the tournament is a classified one the
competition will be keen. Besides classi
fying the players. Dally will fix the ad
vantage handicaps between classes.
At present the lady players are showing
great activity, organizing tournaments
and special matches. All the courts were
well patronized durinsr the week.
WHEELMEN'S MOVEMENTS.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen have Is
sued Invitations for a "wheelmen's at
home," to be held In the big Post-street
Club on Tuesday evening, the 13th in*Â»t..
at 8:30 o'clock. All the "has beens" will
be there, and a jolly evening la promised
all who attend.
The wheeling clubs in and about Loa
Angeles have organized an association
and will conduct an annual GO-mlle relay
race similar to the great event held by the
clubs here each spring. The date Is the
22d Inst.. and there will be at least four
teams entered In the initial event..
George H. Stratton. the most efficient
road racing chairman the Associated
Clubs ever had. dropped Into town quite
unexpectedly the other day after an ab
sence of two years spent in Chicago.
George hopes to renew many old ac
quaintances at the Olympic Club's smoker
next Tuesday nifjht. He will remain herÂ©
a week or ten days.
Robert L. Long, who was one of the
most popular racing men on the coast in
the "good old days." has. come down from
his Tuolumne County mine for a brief
visit.
The captains of the various clubs are
already planning their outinsr tor the
spring months and the club members are
brushing up their rusty spokes for the
opening of the season on Washington's
birthday.
AMONG YACHT-OWNERS.
The annual meeting of the members of
the San Francisco Yacht Club will be
held at the Merchants' Exchange on
Wednesday evening, the 14th inst.. at S
o'clock promptly, for the election of offi
cers to serve during the coming twelve
months. The following have been noml
r.ated for the offices: Commodore. W. N.
McCarthy of the schooner Rauiona; vice
commodore, H. R. Simpkins of the yawl
Traraontar.a; port captain. James Kitter
iran of the launch America; recording
secretary. E. C. Bartlett of the yawl
Frolic; financial secretary. W. G. Morrow Â¦
measurer, R. B. Hogue; treasurer J R.
Â£avoy of the sloop Juanlta. An opposi
tion ticket has been prepared, on which
appears the following names: Commo
dore. Isidor Outtc of the schooner Chispa
and H. R. Simpkins of the yawl Tramon
tana; vice commodore. Robert Bridgeman
of the sloop Thetis, the rest of the nomi
nees being the same as on the regular
ticket. It Is practically certain that the
regular nominees will be elected, as It Is
most unusual to elect as commodore one
who, Lke the owner of the Tramontana,
Ras been a member of the club for less
than a year, is new to the sport of yacht-
Jng and has never before held any of the
offices of the club. With regard to the
cwner of the Â«.his=pa, it may be said that
one who has b*Â«-n commodore for many
years and has been displaced by a
younger man with a different and more
popular policy, is quite unlikely to be
elected. It is understood that the addi
tional nominations were sent in to give
a. little life to the proceeding and insure
a large attendance of members
Last Sunday morning the owners of the
California Yacht Club held a meeting at
the clubhouse on Oakland Creek to dls
cuss matters of interest. The newly
elected commodore. E. N. Walter of the
eloop Embla, presided, and among those
present were ex-Commodore A M Clay
ex-Secretary R. L. Earms. L. S. Sherman'
George Miller. W. G. White. C. E Clark'
C. A. Tornberg. T. J. Turnbull. J. J. Han
ifln Jr. and Eugene Flanders. a sail-
Ing programme for the coming season had
been prepared and was presented to the
owners, by whom it was adopted. The
season will open April 28, and there will
be about one fixed event in every month
thereafter, in addition to the annual class
flag regatta, the race for the Wallace
trophy and the summer cruise up the Sac
ramento River.
T. Carrier, owner of the sloop Jessie E
has built a handsome yawl boat for his
yacht, much after the model of that
owned by ex-Commodore A. M. Clay. She
will go in at the companion way and can
be put into the yacht's cabin. Eugene
Flanders' new launch Alert is the hand
somest craft of her size on the bay, hay
ing a great deal of freeboard.
WILL BANQUET
THE MASTER OF
THEHUNTCLUB
Many Well-Mounted Sports
men Enjoy a Fast Run
After the Hounds.
Last Saturday the members of the San
Mateo Hunt lunched with the master at
the Burlingame Country Club at 1 p. m.,
and afterward met at the Crossways,
Burlingame, at 3 p. m. The run was suc
cessful and well attended.
Last Wednesday the meet wa3 at How
ard Woods, on. the Crystal Springs road,
at 3 o'clock In ths alternoon. and the run
ended at the meadow beyond if. J. Caro
lan's home. In addition to the master of
the hunt and the Huntsmen Keating and
Johnston the following took part in the
chase: J. H. P. Howard, E. J. Tobin, R.
M. Tobin, C. Dunphy, K. D. Beylard, J.
J. Moore and Thomas Driscoll.
This afternoon the rendezvous will be
the Southern Pacific station at Belmont,
and the run will finish near the Burlin
game Country Club house. A large field
is expected. This evening the memb'rs
of the Hunt will give a dinner at the Bur
lingame Country Club tc the master. t\
J. Carolan, at which it is likely there will
be much informal discussion of plans for
the improvement of the Hunt and of the
general interests of the sport. Next
Wednesday the pack will be laid on at
C'rjsial Spring dam, on the north side.
There are already a dozen puppies sired
by the fox hound Ranger, whicn will be
ready to go out next year. It has been
said that the San Mateo pack is almost
mute, but this is not so. At the start they
give plenty of tongue, and also when
checks occur. They should give tongue
throughout the run. however. The drag
hound Is really a harrier, and while he
gives some tongue does not give so much
&'. the fox hound, the American variety
of which 13 lighter an<l faster than the
British fox hound and n:akes much more
music. F. J. Carolan brought back with
him from the Eastern States two fine
dogs, from which several half-breed pup
pies will be bred. Next >eason there will
be a score of puppies ready for work.
Including the huntsmen Keating and
Johnston and the men who take down the
top rails of the fences and replace them
there are five men in the service of the
San Mateo Hunt Club. On Wednesday
all the men rode hunters and took nearly
all the fences at their full height without
utilizing the gaps which are made for the
benefit of ladles and of those who ride
ponies or horses untrained to high Jump
ing.
From a Photograph taken by Taber at Burlingame Crossways last Saturday.
Francis J. Carolan, master of San Mateo County Hunt. Is leaving nothing undone which would
tend to create Interest In the hunting which is held twice a week in the vicinity of Burlingame.
Drag hunting at its best Is not to be compared with fox hunting, but when the latter Is an Im
possibility the "drag" is a splendid substitute. The Californian hunting men are quick to grasp new
ideas and they want the best mounts to be had. sparing no expense in this regard. Hunting strings
both on the coast and in the East are eagerly scanned with a view to obtaining good material. Both
the men and the women who follow the hounds display splendid horsemanship and their growing en
thusiasm speaks -well for the future of the sport on this coast.
ATHLETES ON
THE DIAMOND
AND THE PATH
College Men Preparing for
Their Spring Meet With
Great Vigor.
The Stanford and the California Uni
versity baseball nines have been tried out
In games with the Fireman's Fund team.
Two weeks ago to-day at Palo Alto Stan
ford succumbed to the Firemen, and last
Saturday California met the same fate at
Berkeley. To-day at Recreation Park.
Eighth and Harrison streets, Stanford will
meet the Firemen again.
The California men have been cut every'
night working" with a will to develop a
team that will retain the championship
handed down from last year. There are
a number of new men playing in tha in
and out fields. Warren Smith of football
fame will receive Kaarsberg's delivery.
Kaarsberg is a r.teady pitcher with much
experience, and he is not easy to find.
With the goo<i material brought into the
college by the present freshman clars a
team of fair ability should be developed.
George Van Haltren perhaps the oldest
player in California who is still In the big
Eastern league, is coaching the blue and
gold and will be at Berkeley until the
nnal games with Stanford.
For several days Palo Alto has been
struggling to develop a pitcher. Last
season Lanagan gave promise of being *
strong occupant of the cardinal box, and
his first performance this season ha.i al
most fulfilled expectations. Against 3uch
an experienced iot of stick wlelders us are
on the Fireman's Fund team he pitched
with success, striking out ten men. eomo
of whom have batting records in the Cali
fornia professional league.
Under the guidance of Dr. Murphy.
Stanford's baseball men are advancing
day by day to a degree of proficiency that
augurs well for a strong team this sea
son. â
The line-up for to-day's game at Recre
ation Park is as follows:
Firem's Fund. Positions. Stanford.
Hammond Catcher Strohn.

STANFORD'S ATHLETES.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 9â The
work of the past week on the diamond
has been given over to interclass games
with a hope of bringing out material oth
erwise tco modest to. try for baseball
honors. The result was encouraging to all
concerned. If Coach Murphy could keep
all the men on the field that donned r<ults
for these conte&ts h$ would have plenty of
material with which to build up a strong
nine. It was shewn that talent to relieve
Lanagan in the pitcher's box is not en
tirely lacking. Bennett did well In the
senior-Junior game, as did Lowenthal in
the contest between freshmen and. sopho
mores. Coffin, Parkin and -Murphy *vere
added to the, list of eligible outfielders,
while Dutton and Treager held down the
initial bag creditably. Captain Strohn will
continue behind the bat for the present nt
least. He seems to be the only man com
petent to stop Lanagan since j Swindells
retired. Stanford should make a much
better showing to-morrow against the
Fireman's Fund team than it did two
weeks ago, as every day has seen hard
practice under the leadership of Conch
Murphy. As a team they are still weak
at stick work, but should Improve steadily
with practice.
On the track work is still progressing
slowly. A few men are training faithful ly.
but alone they cannot make a winning
team. What is needed most is men for
the distances and weights. For the latter
events Treager. P. Parker and Wardell
are showing good form and may develop
into point winners. Trainer "Billy" Jk-
Leod returned from Portland early. Â«n tlie
Â¦week, and from now on the men will have
no cause to complain of sore muscles.
TRAP SHOOTERS
PLAN A BIG
SEASON'S WORK
Will Commence Operations
Upon the Close of the Field
Shooting Season.
With the rapidly approaching-, close ot
field shooting on marsh and upland the
trap shooters give evidence of awakening
from their season of inactivity. They are
already outlining plans for what promises
to be the most notable season for this
pastime in the history, of shooting on this
coast. The most notable advance in this
direction was the incorporation yesterday
of the San Francisco Trap Shooting Asso
ciation. This association has taken over
the Ingleside grounds formerly controlled
by the Olympic Gun Club, and will con
duct them on a high plane.
The grounds, which have more natural
advantages than any other grounds In
America, will be made still more attract
ive. An underground system of traps will
be put in and all the conveniences re
quired by the exacting sportsman will be
supplied. In this manner. It is expected
the majority of the gun clubs in the me
tropolitan district will be induced to
avail of the opportunity offered and de
cide their contests on the Ingleside
grounds.
The officers of the new association are:
President, Herbert Kullman; vice presi
dent. Dr. S. E. Knowles; secretary-treas
urer, A. M. Shields; directors, R. I. I).
Grubb, C. A. Haight, Achllle Roos, Kd
ward Donohue and three more yet to be
named. The officers of a number of clubs
have signified their Intention to use the
grounds. All will be accorded the same
consideration, no one club being favored
above another.
The initial bluerock shoot of the year
will be promoted by the Lincoln Gun Club
on the grounds at Alameda Point on
Washington's Birthday, the 22d inst. Nine
events are on the card with more prom
ised if time will permit. In two of the
events amateurs and professionals will be
drawn separately, giving each an oppor
tunity of meeting men In their class. Prep
arations are being made for a large at
tendance of shooters.
From appearances the closing fortnight
of the open season for ducks will provide
good sport. The birds which went south
when the season opened are returning to
their northern haunts. This is the mating
season and the birds are not 'so wild ;'S
they have been, thus affording the gun
men better opportunities to bring them
down. An unusual number of these birds,
chiefly canvasbacks, are in Rlchar-Isons
Bay. They have not been there long
enough to absorb the fishy taste which
makes them unpalatable. A good strong
wind, which would drive the ducks from
their feeding grounds, would greatly im
prove the shooting.
Bert Patrick and Tom Deffenbach Killed
eighteen canvasbacks in Richardsons Bay
last Sunday. Bert Wyman, Lloyd Eaton.
Billy Swain and Charley Dletz were al*o
on the bay in a launch and secured four
teen birds. Contrary to the expectations
of the gunmen, the birds were all* edible,
not having been on the bay a sufficient
length of time to get a fishy flavor. Mr.
Patrick and Fred Johnson will try the
shooting at Reeds, In Marin County, to
morrow.
A. W; Wilson. F. G. Sanborn and Frank
McLennon secured twenty-seven black
brant on their last pilgrimage to Tomalos
Bay. This is the best bag Becured on
any one trip this season.
George Morse, clerk of the United
States Circuit Court in this city, recently
enjoyed a day's shooting on Lake Michi
gan with President McKlnley. In com
pany with another gentleman they se
cured a joint bag of 150 ducks. Mr. Morse
married the President's niece.
McDonald brothers secured fifty birds
at Mount Eden last Sunday, while the
Hightmeir brothers secured a Joint bag of
thirty, principally bluebills and cans. The
Pastime Club men are credited with a bag
of 200 ducks to eight guns.
Russell Crowell, at one time closely
identified with fishing and shooting or
ganizations in this city, is here on a visit.
He is interested In copper- mines In the
southern country, but still finds time to
indulge In his favorite sports of the field.
The Empire Club members expect some
good sport this week at their Black Point
preserves. A large number of birds have
been seen in the vicinity recently.
George Franzen killed sixty-three ducks
near Alvarado last Sunday. This was the
largest individual bag. .J. H. Burfelnd
was the only member of the Spooney Gun
Club; on, lts preserve. He secured flfteeen
ducks in a shoot extending over a couple
of hours.
GREYHOUNDS IN
TRAINING FOR
RICH STAKES
Best Dogs in the Country
Will Start
Handlers Now Giving Them
Special Training in Antici
pation of Sensational
Coursing.
Before the closing days of this month
the most valuable stakes on the coursing
calendar will have been decided. The
John Grace Challenge cup stake, to be
run at Union Coursing Park on the 24th
and 25th of this month. Is easily the most
Important event of the year for grey
hounds. The first prize will be $750, second
$400 and third CjO, with others in propor
tion. The owner* and trainers have been
careful In the running of their dogs for
weeks in anticipation of this big stake.
Some of the best dogs have been held in
reserve, being entered every other week.
so that they would be fresh and anxious
for work.
For Freedom, under the skillful hand
ling of J. M. Halton. is taking on a de
cidedly racy look from the work given
him on the road. On form his most dan
gerous opponent seems to be Curtis &
Bon's great dog Luxor. It is a question
whether the important uogs Overture and
Temple will start, as both are suffering
from the effects of a change of climate.
There are a host of dogs to take their
places. The fortunes of coursing will en
ter strongly into the decision of the stake,
as a tricky hare might put the favorite
out of the running at any time.
The management of Ingleside Park has
announced a champion stake for Wash
ington's birthday. la addition to thÂ«
money offered a valuable silver trophy
goes to the winner.
The stake at Union Park this week at
tracted an entry of ninety-six dogs. The
sport will commence this morning upon
the arrival of the 10:15 train. A special
train will leave Third and Townsend
streets at Ip. m. An unusually high cla^s
lot of dogs are competing and the ulti
mate winner is hard to pick.
At Ingleside the sport will commenca
to-day at 1 p. m., the card being a puppy
stake, which will be entirely disposed of.
A 43-dog open stake will be run through
to-morrow, commencing at 11:30 a. m.
The San Mate) Park management will
run its entire stake of forty-eight dogs
to-morrow, the park not being open this
afternoon. The dogs were well matched
in the drawing and good sport should be
shown.
J. H. Rosseter's Emm Pasha, whose
progeny are among the best dogs running
in California, will be retired after the
John Grace cup stake, for which he is
entered. He has been in the competition
since he was eight months old, winning;
innumerable stakes. He divided th: Amer
ican Waterloo last year with his kennel
mate. Metallic.
The question of dropping coursing on.
Saturdays and running one complete
stake during midweek and another on
Sunday while horse racing is in progress
is being discussed just now. President
Shannon of Ingleside Park favors the
idea and will endeavor to convince other
parties at interest of the benefits to be
derived from It. The Saturday patronage
falls off noticeably each winter so soon as
racing commences on the big tracks, as
the patrons of one sport are also inter
ested in the other. If it be decided to
drop the Saturday coursing It will reduce
the number of dogs which may compete,
eliminating the poorer ones, thus Improv
ing the class.
H. F. Anderson has disposed of hi 3 best
four sreyhounds. Crawford Lad has been
sold to Lopez & Son. while Crawford Braes.
Crawford Lass and Ben Lomond will run
hereafter in the name of C. B. Charles
worth, secretary of Pleasanton Training
Track Assseciatlon.
Pasha Kennels' Miller's Rabble has been
mated with the kennels owners' great dog
Emm Pasha. The former union of Emm
Pasha and Wave proved so great a suc
cess that they have been mated again. D.

As had been expected. Miss Alice Colden
Hoffman won the first competition for the
Council's cup for ladies, the final round
belr:g played on Wednesday, but Miss
Maud Muilins made a good contest, and
â¢were ir not that she plays somewhat wild

better. Miss Alice Hoffman was 3 down
en the first nine holes, and took 65 stroke*
to Miss Maud Muilins' 59. but on the sec
ond nine holes Miss Mulllres was 5 down,
leaving Miss Hoffman 2 up on eighteen

Â¦with IS points, the Pasadena Country Club
was eecor.d with 15. the Santa Catallna
team took third place with 6 and the
Riverside Polo and Golf Club was fourth
Â¦with 2. In the second day's play C. E. Orr
of Pasadena met C. E. Maud of Rlver
eide. but both were playing a poor game,
being especially weak in putting. E. B.
Tufts of Los Angeles was matched
against J. H. Nichol of Santa Catallna
end was 5 down and 6 to play, but Tufts
took the remaining six holes by ftne golf
ing and won the match. J. F. Sartori of

beaten 5 down by E. D. Silent of Santa
Catallr.a. In the final round for the wo
man's championship of Southern Califor

Foster both putted with remarkable ac
curacy, bin Mrs. Bowers drove a some
what longer ball.
John Duncan Dunn, the well-known golf
professional, son of Tom Dunn and
nephew of Willie Dunn, was out on the
Pasudtna links two weeks ago and gave
an exhibition of driving, the balls hav
ing a low "ipht. and tsome of them be
ing 2S yards. Playing with Walter Cosby
in a foursome against C. E. Orr and C. E.
Maud, the. score was all even on eighteen
holes.
The amateur championship of Southern
California, open to members of associate
or allied clubs of the Southern California
Golf Association, will be played for on
the links of the Los Angeles Country

A golfer named Franc L. Grannis of
Pasadena has invented a golf club the
head of which Is supplied with a mechan
ical device that enables It to be used as
a putter, lofter. midiron or cleek. The
club may be constructed for either right
handed or left-handed players. The heel
of the club is made to slide up or down
and is adjusted the proper angle by a
fcrew and pivot. The object of the* in
vention, of course. Is to reduce the num
ber of clubs which it is necessary for a
golfer to possess and to have carried for
him. It is. however, highly Improbable
that golfers will take kindly to the new
ciub or to the absence of caddies
Miss Carroll and Miss Frances Car
roll of San Francisco are spending the
winter at Hotel del Coronado and re
cently gave a ladies* golf tournament to
the links there. Miss Wagner of San

PAPER DRESS
Ellinwood Ball and Morgan
Lunch to Take Place on
Valentine's Day.
Society will have a busy time trying to
keep up with all. the functions arranged
for St. Valentine's day by the swell set.
The most important affairs planned fpr
that day are the Morgan lunch, the Ellin
wood "fancy paper dress" party and the
O'Kane tea.
Miss Thereae Morgan is a delightful
hostess, and all the affairs she presides
at are usually characterized by some new
and charming features. That her luncheon
will be a success goes without, saying.
The "fancy paper dress" - party for
which Miss Charlotte Ellinwood has sent

discover what the commission is dolns-
INVADING THE CHARTER.
IT may seem a small matter to set aside the express
provisions of the new charter in the matter of re
ceipts for fees. Mayor Phelan has obsolete!
those provisions alreauy, and justifies himself by say
ing that the spirit of the charter is satisfied by the
substitution of his will for its letter. Addressing the
Mayor as the self-elected custodian of the spirit of the
charter, we wish to remark that in the case of all
written fundamental laws the whole spirit is reflected
in the whole letter. Every part of the charter is as
sacred and inviolable as any part or the whole of it.
If its letter may be set aside in the least of its details,
the whole text of its entire body may be set aside.
The whole is no stronger than any one line or
phrase. The present Mayor rnav cancel a minor pro
vjrion. but nc sets an example in which one of his
successors may nullify any part of the instrument
... . Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ :
with impunity.
During his campaign Mr. Phelan dwelt with fervor
: :: 1 unction upon the necessity of putting the charter
in the hands of its friends. He was its friends, all and
singular: none 'others need apply. Now he appar
ently assumes that its friends may subject the charter
to amicable mutilation whenever its enforcement^ in
any special particular disturbs that repose which is
the privilege of the elect!
Unfortunately for the city the Mayor has suspended
the charter znd has abolished altogether its carefully
framed provisions relating to a matter of first impor
tance. Past experience with the treasury admonished
the Freeholders of the danger of a leakage in the
matter of fees. The subject was turned over to John
P. Dunn, whose long experience as a fiscal officer
qualified him to safeguard the public interests. He
provided &\ impregnable system of checks on the
treasury. The Mayor has set this aside on the ground
that it is too much trouble and overworks the clerks!
The Mayor has before this set the law aside be
cause it was too much trouble to enforce it. The
law and his oath required him to actually count ths
money in the treasury vault 1 ;. This was too much
trouble, and he repealed the law by his own act and
substituted "hefting" the sacks for actual count of
their contents. In this way he hefted sacks of silver
dollars for gold coin, and the treasury lost over
Sioo.ooo. It is sinister, significant and worthy of no
tice that the Mayor now repeals the charter itself in
a particular in which it was intended to safeguard the
s=!iie treasury. He hefted the sacks to save trouble.
Now he Â«cts aside checks deviled by John P. Dunn
sr ?j\ expert because their use is too much trouble.
Others may follow in his footsteps, and because
the administration of other parts of the charter is
too much trouble it may soon be as tattered as a
tramp's trousers. We suppose there is no remedy for
M*yor Phclan's habit of considering himself su
perior to the law. All that he seems to lack is an
enacting clause and a calf binding to be a whole code.
TROPICAL LABOR.
IT does no harm to look facts in the face. The
Call advised this when the annexation of Hawaii
was proposed, but the newspaper supporters of
that measure in this country and Hawaii were averse
to the consideration of facts, and preferred to sub
stitute fancy and airy speculation for the cold and
sober reality. We proved then that the commercial
prosperity of the islands depended upon the use of
Asiatic coolie labor there. But to this was opposed
a fairy tale about the wide opportunity offered to
American white labor. So far there is not the record
of a single American white laborer migrating to the
islands and taking up the plantation labor which is
the sole producer of the wealth of the country.
At the beginning of this year there were 61,000
Asiatic coolie laborers in the islands, and still they
come. The opening of new sugar lands calls for a
greater supply, and it is at hand, under contract and
with a penal obligation.
The Honolulu Independent of January 20 publishes
the arrivals up to that date in the current year as fol
lows: "January 8, per S.S. China, 667 coolies; Janu
ary 9, per S. S. Lady Joicey, 707; January 12, per S. S.
Doric, 700; January 15, per S. S. Doyo Maru, 726;
January 17, per S. S. Yorohime, 700."
This is a total importation between the Bth and
17th of last month of 3500 coolies, raising the total
in the islands to 64,500 Asiatics of that class. There
are in all the islands a total of only 3000 Americans,
and these are of the land-owning, professional, cap
italist and higher business class.
We think no further evidence is needed to prove the
kind of labor that must be used and depended upon
for productive labor in the tropics. Of all our tropi
cal possessions Hawaii has the most clement climate.
It has neither the heat nor the moisture of the West
Indies and the Philippines. Yet its physical condi
tions effectually bar out white labor, and therefore
make white wages impossible. These coolies get the
maximum of 50 cents a day while they work, and
nothing when they are idle through illness or other
causes. They" are worked in gangs under overseers,
and with all the incidents that follow the employment
of the taskmaster.
The planters who use this coolie labor ask for free
access to our markets for its produce. That produce
comes into direct competition in our markets with the
product of free American labor, which in the same
occupations receives on the average an excess of $2
per day. Every pound of coolie product admitted to
our market free displaces a pound of the
product of free labor and yields to the Gov
ernment no revenue. When the product of
labor is displaced, the labor itself is dis
placed. Therefore the admission of the product of
coolie labor is practically the displacement of Ameri
can by Asiatic labor. If we continue to admit the
product of coolie labor free we are losing wages for
our own. labor and at the same time are losing rev
enue to the Government. This Government has .a
long candle, but the longest is finally used up by burn
ing it at both ends. The employer of American labor
is put at a disadvantage, which he must make good
by reducing the wages of his white labor or by put
ing the product of coolie labor on a revenue equality.
It is easily seen that the employer of coolie labor
at coolie wages in the tropics, and under physical
conditions which bring him greater profit -through
the greater productiveness of the tropical soil, enjoys
a great advantage, which does not need to be in
creased by giving him also free entry to our mar
kets. The home employer, producer and laborer are
entitled to an equalization of advantages, and there
are only two ways to secure it. Either our labor
laws and Asiatic exclusion policy must be extended
to Hawaii and the Spanish islands, making the em
ployment of coolie and other contract labor impos
sible there as here, or the product of such labor must
pay a tariff for the privilege of coming into our mar
ket. In cither case American labor and American
employers will be protected, and the coolie labor and
its employers will be compelled to accept equality
with' us: If there be any other way in which to main
tain our scale of wages and standard of life against
tropical production and servile labor we will be
pleased to hear of it. We know of no reasonable
objection that the Hawaiian employer can make to
this proposition. If he pay American wages to free
labor let him have free access to our markets, for
that equalizes his condition with ours. If he employ
coolie labor at Asiatic wages, let him pay duty on its
product coming here for a market. The principles of
our constitution are fixed in the requirement of equal
ity under the government created by that instrument.
It was the principle of equality that -abolished slavery
here. The existence of free and chattel labor under
the same constitution and Government was incom
pat:t lc with equality. When Seward and Lincoln dc
claret' the irrepressible conflict between free and slave
labor, and said that the whole Union must become
all free or all slave, for a house divided agains* itself
cc.uid not stand, they were demanding just what we
demand now. If it be wrong now it was wrong
when the founders of the Republican. party inscribed
it on their banners. We wait for some one to show
that it is wrong, for until that is done we shall not
cease to insist that it is right, in the faith that only
what is right will survive.
A FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE.
SECRETARY FRED W. EATON of the Sun
set Telephone and Telegraph Company is re
ported in the Examiner of Thursday to have
given that paper a statement concerning certain finan
cial plans of the company. In the course of the state
ment he is quoted as saying: "There are other con
tingencies to be met, for which we must be prepared,
among them the tax of fifty cents a quarter just im
posed by the San Francisco Supervisors. We have
20.000 telephones in operation in San Francisco,
which means an additional burden to us of $40,000 a
year, a sum we cannot afford to pay and maintain our
present rate?. Our assessment has been raised to the
limit and we are paying a heavy license besides. We
are convinced the tax is illegal and intend to fight it
in the courts. If beaten we shall be compelled to do
like other corporations and put it in the bill. How
our patrons will relish an increase of fifteen cents a
month on their bills we cannot foretell, but I suppose
there will be some lively kicking."
Assuming that report to be true, the people have
a fight before them, and The Call conies forward at
once to take it up. It is to be determined whether
the Telephone Company is a creature of the law of
California or a master of the law. If it be a creature
of the law and subject to statutes, it will have to pay
taxes. If it can shirk the burden of taxation, then it
will be something above the law, and the only way
to deal with it then will be to revoke its charter and
establish telephones as a public utility, as has been
done elsewhere.
By the cunning of the astute Mr. Pillsbury, attor
ney for the corporation, the new charter was drawn
in such a way as to exempt the telephone company
from the supervision of the municipal authorities. It
is the consciousness of that exemption which em
boldens the corporation to announce an intention to
shift its taxes upon the public by increasing the al
ready exorbitant charges for service. It is also that
which leads the secretary to Â¦ remark merrily and
mockingly that the shifting may result in some lively
kicking.
The recourse of the people is the State Legislature.
That body has a right to supervise corporations. It
therefore becomes the duty of all citizens to prepare
at once for the coming contest. In every district all
candidates this fall for the Senate or for the Assem
bly should be required to give specific pledges to vote
at the next meeting of the Legislature for a bill pro
viding an efficient and comprehensive system of tele
phone regulation. Such a measure will not be a nov
elty in legislation. The Massachusetts" Legislature
has been discussing this winter a system of State
regulation of telephones, and in other States the same
problem is under consideration.
The issue that has been raised by the telephone
company is one that cannot be compromised. Either
corporations are to be permitted to shirk taxes or
they are to be required to pay them. If the telephone
company be permitted to make a mockery of the
law, other corporations will soon follow the example.
The fight is on. The Call enters upon it with a de
termination to win. If a victory for the people can
not be gained at the coming Legislature, then the
fight will go on until another is elected. It may take
a year, or two years, or even more, but in the end
the law will triumph. That triumph, moreover, will
not be long delayed if the people be resolute in en
forcing their rights. The question should be made
one of the vital State issues of the campaign this fall,
and if that be done the "lively kicking" that no.v
makes Mr. Eaton smile will be on the side of the
tax-shirking telephone company.
themselves, yet they take no interest in it as a pleas
ure resort, and almost invariably go somewhere else
when they wish amusement.
Perhaps the Parisians may make something more
out. of their enterprise than the English or the
Scotch. They are more sociable people and have
more delight in music and art. The outlook, how
ever, is not bright for the movement. When people
go out in search of recreation they are hardly likely
to resort to a place whose primary object is not that
of amusing but of enlightening and elevating them.

A "PEOPLE'S PALACE" IN PARIS.
ââ â â â â â â
A MOVEMENT has been started in Paris to es
tablish a "People's Palace" or university on a
scale far in excess of anything yet attempted.
According to the announcement there arc to be or
ganized under one roof libraries, reading and class
rooms, museums, gymnasiums, swimming baths, lec
ture halls, chemical laboratories, a temperance res
taurant, consultation rooms where advice and counsel
will be given by competent authorities on legal, med
ical and commercial questions, and a theater, where
there will be presented a drama free from all objec
tionable features.
. The promoters of the project are not millionaires
like Lady Hurdctt Coutts, who founded the People's
Palace in East London, neither is it to be a munici
pal enterprise like the People's "Palace in. Glasgow.
It is to be established by a co-operative society known
as the "Union pour Â»Taction morale." In their
prospectus they say: "We want truth, beauty, mor
ality for all. We would fain see the people partici
pate in that higher good which may be regarded as
the patrimony of the human race. Our society asso
ciates itself with no especial creed, religious, political
or philosophic. We do not wish to make partisans;
on the contrary, to unite, bringing different minds to
gether in the quest of truth and beauty."
While the Parisians are thus entering with hope
upon this movement for opening a palace of beauty
and truth to the people, it is noted in Great Britain
that similar enterprises Undertaken there have failed,
fhe great institution in London has been gradually
forced away from the original intention of the
founder. A recent report says it has never become a
social center in the East End of London. There are
flower shows, art collections and industrial exhibi
tions, but the People's Palace invariably impresses
visitors as a dull place where there is little entertain
ment for the masses. The children of tradespeople
are drawn into the class-rooms, and there is a con
stant development of the educational work, but the
exhibitions and concerts have not attracted the char
acteristic workers and idlers of the East End.
Even more complete appears to be the failure of
the famous People's Palace established by the mu
nicipality of Glasgow. That institution contained a
ivrtseum, a picture pallery, a promenade concert hall.
a conservatory, a library and a lecture-room. It
forms a warm, brilliantly lighted place of resort to
which the public is admitted without charge, but
while the class-rooms have been well patronized, it
has never been popular as a place of recreation.
When it was first opened large crowds attended the
concert"*, but as soon as the novelty wore off the
crowd diminished, and it is now said that while the
Palace belongs to the people of Glasgow and they are
duly proud of it as something they have done for.
The .real seriousness of the British situation in
South Africa has never been more apparent than now.
It is clearly shown by the promptness with which the
Government has acceded to the request of its South
African Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner, for the as
sistance of a lawyer.

A difference of opinion exists between

Judge Cabaniss as to tho Issuance of war

court yesterday rcorning to argue the
matter with the Judge. His contention
is that under the charter all complaints

accordance with that contention he had
instructed the warrant clerks not to "O

The Alameda left the well-advertised
yacht Norna and her master. "Commo

vessel has been In trouble in China, Japan
and Hawaii, but everything seemed to be
working smoothly when the Alameda was
in port. "Prince" Peterson of Honolulu
was "Commodore" Weaver's traveling
companion, and they both seemed to be
enjoying themselves. A regatta was held
while the Alameda was at Auckland and
the Norna was the flagship. While in
Yokohama Weaver had to give a bot
tomry bond in order to get his yacht out
of the clutches of the law officers.

perior Court, and Donald Y. Campbell of
the San Francisco bar. Some fifteen min
utes of deliberation were necessary for the
Judges to reach their decision, which was
announced by Judge Hunt. "We, the
judges," he said, "regret that there are
not three medals to award Instead of one,
but as we are limited to a single selection
of the debater who shows the greatest
merit In the mastery of the subject, man
ner of address and In his argument, we
are of the opinion that Wilisie M. Martin
should be awarded the Carnot medal."
The six debaters who took part in the
sixth annual intercollegiate contest of ar
gument and oratory were: Willsle M.
Martin. California, affirmative; J. F. Eng
lish, Stanford, negative; Cecil M. Mar
rack, Stanford, affirmative: John E.
Springer, Stanford, affirmative: Willlans
B. Greely, California, affirmative, and
Fred Boston, California, negative.
Hearst Hall was taxed to its capacity
with students and friends an hour before
the debate began. Both sides were well
represented and an incessant shouting of
college yells of every character and de
scription filled in the time before the de
bate was called and during the interim
while the Judges were counting points on
the youns wielders of the logical sword.
It was half- past 8 when Professor Clapp
of the University of California introduced
Mr. Martin, â¢ the opener of the debate.
Each speaker was allowed fifteen minutes
in his opening argument and five minutes
to close.
Martin started the ball of argument
rolling. He claimed that it was not only
necessary that a change should be in
stituted in the present system of minis
terial responsibility to the Chamber? in
the French Government, but that it was
immediately imperative to preserve that
Government. The responsibility to the
President would do away with Presiden
tial crises and give a stability to the
French Government which it does not now.
possess, bringing with It a series of checks
and balances. Martin's argument was
logical, impressively stated and clear-cut.
But it was his rebuttal that won him the
medal. In a rapid, quick delivery he
lloored his opponents point by point.
Tho arguments of the affirmative hinged
upon the resultant instability of the pres
ent system of government by which the
legislative body controlled the actions of
the executive, making a figurehead of
that body. , _
â¢ The negative declared that tyranny
would result from an Increase of the
power of the executive and a destruction
of the parliamentary system of govern
ment ns in use in France. Many sue
geÃtlons were offered as remedies, which
it was alleged would bÂ« consonant with
the spirit and genius of the French peo
ple, but the one remedy of ministerial re
sponsibility was pronounced the worst.
The judges thought otherwise.

ADVERTISEMENTS.^ Â£
DANGEROUS TO LIFE.
Surgical Operations for Piles Danger-
ous and Unnecessary.
The failure of ointments, salves ar.d pills
to permanently cure piles has led many to
bellevA the only cure to be a surgical op-
eration.
But surgical operations are dangerous
to life, and moreover are often unsuccess-
ful, and &t this time are no longer used by
the best physicians nor recommended by
them.
The safest and surest way to cure any
case of piles, whether Itchlrss. bleedin? or
protruding, is to use the Pyramid Pile
Cure, composed of vegetable oils and
acl<23. healing and soothing to the In-
flamed parts, and containing no opium cr
other narcotic.
Dr Williams, a prominent oriflcial sur-
geon, says: "It is the duty of every sur-
geon to avoid an operation if possible to
cure in any other way. and after many
trials with the Pyramid Pile Cure I un-
hesitatingly recommend it in preference to
an operation. ' *. â
"The harmless acids and oils contained
in it cause the blood vessels to contract
to a natural condition and the tumors are
absorbed and the cure is made without
pain. Inconvenience or detention from
business. .^
"In bleeding and Itching piles the Pyra-
mid is equally valuable."
In some cases a single package of the
Pyramid has cured long standing cases:
being in suppository form it is always
ready for use, can be carried In the
pocket when traveling: It is applied at
night and does not interfere with the daily
occupation.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is not only the
safest and surest remedy for piles, but is
the best known and most popular from
Maine to California. Every physician and
druggist knows it and what It will do.
The Pyramid Pile Cure can be found at
all drug stores at 50c for full sUed
treatment.

ANOTHER ADDITION TO THE SUGAR FLEET.
The human system in old age must have a large
store of nervous energy and rich, nourishing blood.
Paine's Celery Compound keeps the liver and kidneys
active, and the body strong.
â¢â¢My wife and I hav^ used two bottles of Paine's Celery Compound with
2reat advantage to our general health. It cured her rheumatism and proved
a sood regulator of the system in general and a tonic for the nerves. In my
own case 1 have found it a cur^ for kidney trouble arising: from old age, as 1 am
row in my 75th year. In this trouble it has given me almost instant relief."

NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â There seemed to be
a complete withdrawal to-day of the general
Interest Jn the etock market which was so
conspicuous a factor In the active trading of
the early days of the week. Two days' reaction
in prices served to discourage the outside de
mand and orders to commission houses fell
to practically nothing. There was a continual
iribble of realizing sales nil day and the bears
Industriously pecked at the market here and
th<>re wherever they detected evidences cf
realizing or long etock offered for sale. The
most notable price movements were the specu
lative industrials and specialties. Late In the
-ay on the report of a new British reverse
at LadjÃinith the hears made a determined
raid on Sugar and Third Avenue, forcing them
off an extreme 3% and 6"4 respectively. The

was listless and heavy for the greater part
of the day and it was not greatly affected
either by the attack of the bears or the final
rally. Losses reached a point in only a few
stocks. American Tobacco was a conspicuous
exception to the general weakness during the
day, and after an early decline rallied strongly
3W. closing at about the best. There was a
good demand for Erie first preferred, which
carried it up at one time 1%, most of the gain
being lost. Much doubt exists as to the prob
able effect on this market of further British
reverses in the South African war. and the
confusion of the morning was clearly reflected
in the movements. The forthcoming bank
statement had much to do with the dis
inclination to extend speculative commitments.
The recent movement of funds from the sub
treasury to the banks has been reversed and
the latter institutions have lost on that ac
count J(tfs.ooo. The snipments of money to the
interior have increased over last week and
the receipts have diminished so that the net
gain on that account has been cut down to
a little over $l.OCO.Â«H). Allowing for the sub
treasury absorptions the week's gain in cash
will therefore be Insignificant. The liquidation
of speculative prolits in the Stock Exchange
during' the week may have relieved somewhat
the pressure on the banks for credits. The
call money market has not shown any in
creased pressure for funds, but the rates for
time money were distinctly firmer in tone.
Loans on exceptional collateral were made
early In the week at 3^- per cent for short
periods, but the minimum rate to-day was
advo-'-ed to 4 per cent. Sterling exchange
also hardened in sympathy with the discount
rates in London. The ratner violent break in
the prices of cotton ><n s-p?rulative liquidation
probably had some sympathetic effect in the
stock market.
Business In the bond market fell off con
siderably and price changes were Irregular.
Total Bales, par value. $1,805,000.
United States bonds were unchanged In bid

tirement, it being apprehended that his re
inforcements had bÂ»-;n intercepted. Paris was
disturbed by the report from Boer sources that
General Buller had again been driven across
thÂ«-- Tugela. The continued talk of mutiny of
the Egyptian forces also caused an uneasy
feeling, and wild hints were current to-day
that the eighth army division had been sent

rumors was confirmed. Americans were steady

midst of the general unrest. New York took

only Email application. Silver closed at 274 d
on Eastern buying.

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row, will say: The strength of staples, and
particularly those of agricultural origin, is the
leading feature this week at least. In gen
eral trade weather conditions have not favored
a large distribution, but comparisons with a
year ago are still quite favorable. Enlarged
speculation is reflected in increased clearings
and comparisons with last year are again en
couraging, while gains over years previous to
1599 are very marked. In strength of demand
and size of advance cottons are still easily
first. Although the crop movement has no
ticeably enlarged so active has been the de
mand from foreign spinners that fully three
eighths of a cent advance Is shown.
Provisions have been quite strong through
out the week and active demand is responsible
for higher prices of pork and lard In the face
of larger receipts of hogs at primary markets.
The strength of the raw sugar position has
been further increased this week by bullish
reports from European beet markets and the
expectation that receipts of cane sugar are
apt to be light In the future. Refined grades
have been strong, partly owing to the strength
of raw and partly to the shutting down of
a number of refineries. Coffee steadily ad
vanced, the result of continued small crop re
ports from Brazil and of good consumptive de
mand here. Hides and leather are firmly main
tained, though reports from the boot and shoe
trade of current business are not very good.
Fine grades of wool are quiet, but there is
still an urgent demand for medium grades
and quarter bloods sell better, considerable Im
ported wools having changed hands in East
ern markets. Reports from the wool trade
continue favorable to a hlph degree and firm
or higher prices are regarded as a certainty
Unfavorable weather has affected distribu
tion in most sections this week, but mail orders
have been of fair size and the spring trade
outlook continues unimpaired.
Iron prices vary with the market reporting,
but no widespread weakness is yet noted.
Some concessions, notably by a prominent
Southern furnace, are reported at Birmingham.
Some export business is reported done at a
shading by an Eastern furnace. Strength of
quotations. In fact, grows as the interior is
approached, the most firmness being noted at
Chicago. Any further reaction In Southern
pig prices Is expected to. develop a good ex
port demand, the margin of price differences
now being very small. A further gain in blast
furnace capacity Is noted. Current production
is now little below 18,000.000 tons yearly and
some increase of stocks is shown. Corisider
able business could be done at the West In
rails at a concession of $l-per ton, but the
active buying of old rails Is taken to mean
that no weakening will occur. Steel plates
have again lost the strength displayed some
weeks since. Copper is steady and tin is
again higher on a speculative advance in
London.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregated 2,092.3'J bushels, against 2,
724,937 bushels last weelt. 5,550,500 bushels in the
corresponding week of 1899, 3,419.504 bushels
in 1898, 2 051.345 bushels in 1897 and 2,718,291
bushels in 1566. Since July 1, this season, the
exports of wheat aggregate 123,012.322 bushels,
against 156.599.1E9 bushels last year and 153,
649.C97 bushels in 1597-SS.

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1900.
by the volume of offerings of funds than by
any further relaxation in actual rates. Many
tenders consider r that with the large demands
for accommodation by merchants and manu
facturers and with the April disbursements yet
to be encountered no further declines in rates
are Justified. The money market, however, had
offered no obstacle to the resumption of activ
ity in speculation, and the fact that industrial
securities of good quality â¢ are accepted with
freedom where they form a reasonable propor
tion of the collateral for loans has had con
slderablÂ« Influence in stimulating an improve
ment in that Dortion of the general list. The
market has been decidedly more active. At
the same time the trading' continues to be in
the main of a professional kind. Pools and
large operators have made their presence felt
by takine various portions of the list in hand
and in some Instances have from time to time
taken profits in stocks which were put up when
the movement began a fortnight or so back.
This was particularly shown in the steel and
other Industrials. The tendency toward the
close of the week was decidedly heavy on ex
tensive realizing sales. Commission houses
have been more active, but the public appetite
for Fpeculation, though decidedly better than
it was, has by no means reached" the proportion
which it presented before the December break
in the market. On the other hand, London
shows a disposition to buy American stocks.
Money is easier in all the European markets
and the readiness of the foreign public to
speculate seems to be finding an outlet In our
stocks, with a result that on several days of
the week the foreign purchases here ranged
from 15.000. t0 20,000 shares.
The feet that there was no news of fur
ther British reverses and that London even
entertained expectations of better results In
connection with the war in South Africa re
moved for the moment much feeling of un
certainty that prevailed as to the course of the
foreign markets in that connection and has
enabled Wall street to give its undivided atten
tion to the favorable features of the home
situation.
CHICAGO, Feb. 9.â The trade In Wheat was
dull. Parie was lower, and Liverpool also de
pressed, and although May Wheat opened a
shade up at 6Â£4<365%c a reaction quickly fol

NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The Industries are still surpassing in actual
output the work of any previous year. The
new business is not correspondingly large nor
could such orders be accepted by most in
dustries if offered, but enough are coming to
prevent stoppage of works or much decline in
prices. . In woolen goods new business of re
markable volume sustains a marked advance
in prices and In other lines of Importance as
In machinery orders indicate a surprising for
eign demand. Meanwhile, though encouraged
by the abundance and ease of money, specu
lation does not in any direction as yet go
without check far enough to do mischief.
There is much of the speculative spirit abroad,
but also more caution than is usually shown
after a year of exceptional prosperity. Per
haps the war in Africa, with its possibilities
of daily surprise, is in that respect productive
of good.
No change of consequence yet appears in
prices of wool though the demand from spin
ners is limited and It is .perceived that they
had previously supplied themselves quite fully
for the heavy weight season, for which they
have taken very la^ge orders. It 13 thought
by some that enforced sales of foreign wool,
which was withdrawn from the London sale
in January In order to prevent a greater de
cline, may hereafter affect this market.
The weekly output of pig iron February 1
was 293,014 -tons, but stocks unsold rosj 20,330
tons in January, indicating a consumption
slightly smaller than the output when the
month began. As the consuming works were
naturally stopped about the holidays more
than the furnaces the figures prove little, but
bessemer and grey forge at Plttsburg have
not changed in price during the paÂ»t week
and slightly lower offerings of pig by Southern
and other new furnaces at Chicago and East
ern markets have had little effect. It is more
significant than the decline of prices for some
weeks in Â¦ bars, plates and sheets has been
checked. Large orders have been taken for
these and -other products. Indicating that the
works in need of business may have obtained
enough for a time.
Though prices of hemlock sole have been
reduced half a cent and of split and upper
leathers the boot end shoe manufacturers are
not yet inclined to buy largely, as they are
getting but a small part of the contracts they
need at this season. The Jobbers still hold
back as far as they can and the slow yielding
In hides at Chicago Increased expectation that
leather may further decline. But though buy
ing is very small the works are producing and
delivering more than ever before. Last year
the deliveries from Boston were 34 per cent
larger than in IS9O, but this year thus far they
have, been 19 per cent larger than last year.
Failures for the week were 245 in the United
States, agalnet 217 last year, and 33 in Canada,
against 35 last year.

REMOVAL OF THE
MISSION TRACKS
STRONGLY URGED
Supervisors Listen to
Protests.
The proposed ordinance declaring the
tracks of the Southern Pacific Company
in the Mission district public nuisances,
and providing for the abatement of the
same, came up for consideration yester
day before the Supervisors' Street Com
mittee and after hearing a number of ar
guments' for and against the proposition
it was decided to take the matter under
advisement. It is understood that the
committee will make no recommendation
to the board at its next meeting and it
may be several weeks before any action
ls taken. i
J. E. Foulds, attorney for the railroad
company, spoke against the ordinance.
He contended that the franchise under
which the tracks are maintained ls a
question of State law.
"The policy of the State," said he, "is
to admit a transcontinental road into this
city, for which permission was given by
statute framed In 1861. When the con
sent of the board Is once given, no mat
ter In what form, such action bars the
present board from revoking the same.
Complaints against the operation of the
franchise must be made- to the Attorney
General, who may remedy the evil by an
action at court.
"The Southern Pacific Company Is now
constructing a bay shore road and dig
ging a tunnel through the San Bruno
Mountains, which will take some time to
complete. The company will submit to
any regulation, but asks that it be not
destroyed."
Superviaor Curtis asked if the company
could Bhow that a franchise had been
granted under the statute of 1861, and Mr.
Foulds replied that the grant was given
by order of the Board of Supervisors In
1596. To a question propounded by George
Center, Mr. Foulds denied that the emoke
and dirt from the trains were a nuisance.
"The original plan,' said Mr. Center,
"was to have the road go by. way of the
bay shore, but the route was changed to
please some of the directors. The South
ern Pacific Company has no franchise for
the road from Sixteenth to Twenty-fifth
Btreet," and Randall street, Sunnyside and
Ocean View crossings are dangerous. The
speed of the trains is too great, property
has depreciated and many lives have been
sac ri ficed. " ijflfiÃl
T. McKenney spoke against" the board
placing much credence in thÂ« statements
and promises of Mr. Foulds and the com
Â§any he represents. He said that the
outhern Pacific Company had broken
every promise It bad -made to the people
and claimed that the board possessed the
power to abate the nuisance by destroy,
ing property, if necessary* to do so. â¢ He
referred to the Selby Smelting Works and
others that had been done away, with by
the board.

Schnee of the Federation of Improvement
Clubs, Mrs. Hanson and Mrs. Holton of
Sunnyside and F. Gamier of the Fair
mount Improvement Club, all spoke in
favor of the ordinance Â«nd made earnest
appeals to the board to put an end to
the frequent slaughter of lives by the
trains. Street cars, they said, have been
trapped between gates and many lives
placed In Jeopardy from approaching
trains. :M. Rooney told of the passage
of ordinances, similar to the one. under
discussion, in New York, wnere the ope
ration of steam roads had been changed
four different times to meet the growth
of that city.
The committee decided to reconsider Its
action denying a franchise to the Bay
and Coast Railway. In order to give the
fietltloners and protestants another hear

Hill and Gray Bros.' quarries went over
for onÂ© week. A batch of laborers' de

the non-arrival of the necessary slides.
Professor S. Brown of Stanford Univer
sity was to have lectured on the Kings

CLARK LIBERAL
WITH HIS COIN
Gave Thousands to One
of His Lieutenants.
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â A. J. Steele
was cross-examined in the Clark case to
day. He said he had participated in the
fall campaign of IS9S with Clark's friends.
He had made a trip to Great Falls before
the Legislative election and another after
the election. On the first trip he had
taken $700, which Davidson had given him,
and on the second 5300. Davidson had
given him money for expenses Incurred in
other trips made throughout the State.
Witness said that at ihat time he was a
bankrupt, having failed in business. He
had kept no account of expenditures, but
whenever he wunted money he went to
either Davidson or to Wellcome. During
the sitting of the Legislature he had re
ceived $1000 from Davidson and $5000 or
$GWO from Wellcome. The largest sum ob
tained from Wellcome at any one time
was $1000, which had been given him after
the Senatorial election, when Wellcome
had handed him a roll of bills, telling him
to pay his debts and keep the rest. He
had received $2000 from Wellcome after
the Investigation of the Grand Jury.
Steele gave a partial list of persons to
whom he had paid money in sums of $100,
they being persona working in the interest
of Clark for the Senate.
Referring to the visit he received at
Helena from Representative Garr prior
to the meeting of the Legislature, Steele
Bald in reply to Senator Turley that his
representation to Garr that he wanted to
see him about bounty scalps was all a pre
text, that In reality he had desired to sew
him In Clark's Interest as a Senatorial
candidate. He had, however, not urged
the matter when he found that Garr was
Inclined to support Conrad. In reply to
questions from Senator Burrows, Steele
paid that during the campaign and the
sitting of the Legislature he had received
$10,000 or $12,000 for use in politics, and
that he had spent all this sum except $700
or $SOn. which he had kept.
While Steele was on the stand the pro
priety of the use of a report made br
Attorney General Nolan of the proceed
ings of the Lewis and Clark County Grand
Jury In the Montana Supreme Court was
raised. Foster of Senator Clark's counsel
expressed himself as strongly In opposi

the Grand Jury room. Attorney General
Nolan was present and volunteered to
LAWYER ASSAILS
MRS, MOLINEUX
*
Sensation in the Murder
Trial.
NEW YORK. Feb. 9.â Assistant District
Attorney Osborne to-night completed his
argument in the trial of Roland B. Mol
ineux for the murder of Mrs. Katherine
J. Adams. Recorder Goff will charge tho
jury to-morrow morning and the twelve
men are expected to take up at once the
question of the guilt or the innocence of
the prisoner.
On account of the illness of Juror Man
heim Brown, despite, the immense cost of
this celebrated case, reaching as it does
Into the hundreds of thousands of dol
lars, it is not expected the Recorder will
insist upon severe measures or require
that the Jury be locked up for any con
siderable length of time, even though it
should fall to reach an agreement.
Undoubtedly the most dramatic event
of the day was the attack which Assist
ant District Attorney Osborne made upon
Mrs. Molineux, the wife of the prisoner.
This attack was somewhat unexpected,
since Barlow S. Weeks, the attorney for
the prisoner, had already characterized
the mere Introduction of the evidence con
cerning the fact that Molineux lived with
his wife before marriage under the as
sumed name of "Mr. Chesebrough" as
"low and mean and vile." But Osborne
elected to pick up the gauge of battle
thrown down before him by the counsel
for the defendant. The war was on in an
Instant when Battle, who is associated
with Weeks in the defense of Molineux,
objected to Osborne saying that Mrs.
Molineux was the sole motive in the case,
that Molineux had been trying to marry
her and that she had consented to marry
him suddenly only after Barnet, who had
been a devoted admirer, was cold in his
grave. Osborne had just finished reading
the note signed "Blanche," sent by Miss
Chesebrough to Barnet during his last
illness, and when Battle interposed his
objections Osborne turned quick as a flash
toward Mrs. Molineux.
"There ls the woman, there is the mo
tive!" exclalmeu he in tones dramatic be
cause of their nerce intensity.
Battle, still continuing to object upon
the ground that the statements had not
been supported by the evidence, Osborne's
voice rang out:
"Let the galled jade wince! I do not
blame counsel for objecting; but that
woman is the living motive in tho Barnet

poison to Cornish. I hate to have to

is shameful that Mr. Weeks brought these
ladles to this court when he knew tho

continuation of the cowardly crime and
shows the nature of the man who would

General Molineux left his seat at the
conclusion of this attack, leaned over the
back of his wife's chair and patted his
daughter-in-law reassuringly on the
shoulder. Molineux himself never moved.
In closing Osborne said:

the matter was not material.
State Senator W, E. Tierney of Broad
water County was questioned especially
concerning his financial condition prior to
and since his election to the Senate, to
meet the testimony of Dolenty, a banker
of Townsend. Mont., to the effect that
Tierney had paid off a large indebtedness
to his bank since the adjournment of tile
Legislature and had shown many other
evidences of Improved financial condition.
Tierney said that he had been Instru
mental in organizing the State Bank of
Townsend and that he had paid his in
debtedness to Dolenty's bank by transfer
ring to the other bank. He had also sold
more or less property. The witness 3aid
that he had considered himself worth
about $50,000 before tho meeting of the
Legislature, and that there had been no
material Increase since. He also' said that
Clark had not been instrumental in the
organization of the new bank at Town

not his individual notes, but were stven
by firms in which he was interested.

business. I am 33 years of age and Mr.
Woodbridge is 66, so you see we are both
of age. ft was not an elopement. We
eimply wanted secrecy to avoid unpleas
ant publicity. His folks are becoming
reconciled and they had no strings at
tached to him anyway."
Just then Mr. Woodbridge made his
appearance at his new residence. He
marched up the hill leading to the house
with head thrown back and steps that
were Intended to be elastic.
"Here's papa now. He'll tell you all
about it," remarked the bride, coyly.
"It's nobody's business about my getting
married," declared Mr. Woodbridge. "It
wa_s not an elopement and we just went
to Sacramento to be married so the news
papers would not get into it and write it
up like they did the Boardman case. A
man can love even though he is old. My
wife loves me, too, and we are both
happy."
Mr. Woodbridge is one of the pioneers of
Oakland. He has been in the real estate
business here for many years and is very
wealthy. His wife's maiden name was
Salina Ogden. Before becoming a lady
barber she was married to a man named
Butler, who died several years ago. The
bride refused to say where she resided
' or worked in San Francisco, dismissing
the. matter with the statement that she
was employed and lived at various places.
OAKLAND, Feb. 9.â Arthur S. Wood
bridge, the well known real estate
dealer, has been wedded to Mrs.
Salina Butler, a female barber of
San Francisco. He is 66 years of age and
a grandfather. The bride acknowledges
33 yeara and a previous marital experi
ence. In order to make his tonsorial cap
tivator his wife the aged Lothario braved
the anger of his old mother and his
daughters. The happy couple are now
ensconsed in a little dove cote sort of a
cottage on Palmetto avenue In Fruitvale.
Mr. Woodbridge first met his present
wife in a female barber shop of San
Francisco several months ago. She re
moved the hirsute stubble from his chin
so deftly that the old gentleman called
again. As she bathed his face with bay
rum and manipulated his physiognomy
with her soft, white hands he went into
rhapsodies. Then he commenced to haunt
the place where razors were wielded by
ladies, and no matter how often the other
female barbers told him that he was next
the Infatuated real estate dealer from
Oakland always ignored them and waited
for Mrs. Butler to Jab the lather into his
nose and eyes.
Then moonlight rambles ensued. The
venerable gentleman with grandchildren ;
made love with all the ardor of a youth I
in springtime. About six months ago he
had his lady love abandon barbering and
domiciled her in Fruitvale. Two weeks
ago the pair quietly went to Sacramento
and during the hurly-burly of the legis
lative session they were secretly married.
"I didn't object for the simple reason
that I didn't know that my father was
going to marry that woman," declared
Mrs. Clara White, the daughter of the
ancient lover when seen at her residence,
101 Fifth street, this city. "They sneaked
out of town and were married on the
quiet. I have not seen the woman and
don't want to. I don't know anything
about her and do not care to discuss the
matter. He is certainly of age and so is
the from what I have heard, so I guess
they had a right to get married If they
wanted to." .
Mrs. Woodbridge, the mother of the en
amored old groom, is S5 years of age,
but is still vigorous enough to condemn
her son's act. Her loquacity was
squelched by her daughter, however, and
she was not permitted to give her opinion
of tha affair.
"We went to Sacramento to get married
to avoid any such notoriety as old man

Government purveys placed Angel Island
in Marin County.
BAN RAFAEL, Feb. 9.â ls Angel Island
in Marin or San Francisco Coumy? This
is the question that Is agitating the minds
of Coroners Cole of San Francisco and
Eden of Marin. So sure Is Eden that the
oodles washed ashore on the island are
nis that he has decided to cue Coroner
Cole and Deputies Flynn and Flanigan
for the expenses incurred, amounting to
530, in his expedition in search of Burton
>\ . Hardiman's remains this morning. In
this view of the question he is backed up
by the opinion of County Surveyor Rich
ardson. The Surveyor says that the
county survey maps show the island to
be, with the exception of a few feet of
beach, in Marin County. On the other
hand. Us residents vote in the Forty-fifth
District of San Francisco. Eden, who had
been notified of the discovery of Hardi
man's remains last night. left for Angel
Island In a launch this morning only to
find the body gone. Deputies Flynn and
Flanipan were discovered to be the body
snatchers and Eden, boiling with rage,
went to San Francisco to have an ex
planation. After a heated controversy,
Thomas Walsh, secretary of the Election
Commissioners, was telegraphed to in re
gard to which county could claim the isl
and. He replied it was in San Francisco
County.
Eden, when seen to-night, stated that
this was not the first time that corpses
had been lifted from under his very nose,
ac it were. He declared emphatically that
he will be reimbursed for expenses of
his fruitless expedition. District Attor
ney Mclsaac and the Coroner had a con
sultation to-night, and as a result a suit
will be filed in a few days to compel Cole
and his deputies to reimburse the county
for Its expenses in the matter.

They were taken before Judge Gardner

gone to the San Francisco intelligent

there was a job at Ukiah, for which sev

them from custody with good advice and

VERDICT FOB DEFENDANTS.
POSTUM CEEEAL.
BISHOP M C CABE.
T_Â« Famous Minister's Experience
Â¦ With Coffee.
The well-known Bishop said to one of
his friends, tonic years ago: "I was a
eireat sufferer from severe headaches,
and at times after traveling many miles
to dedicate a church or perform some
other important duty, found myself con-
fined to a bed when the time came, and
was unable to carry out my work. I
finally discovered that when I left off
coffee for a few days the headaches dis-
appeared, and by further experiment
discovered that the coffee was undoubt-
edly the cause of the difficulty, which
finally entirely disappeared when I left
off coffee altogether."
The person to whom this remark was
made is Mrs. Amy K. Glass, wife of a
Methodist minister at Kolf, la. She
says: "My own experience with coffee
was very convincing. I was grown up
before I ever drank coffee, but was ad-
vised by a friend (who meant it kindly)
to use weak tea and coffee, because a
warm drink aided digestion. I soon
thereafter commenced to have nervous
and sick headaches; could not believe it
was the coffee.
"My husband, who had suffered from
dyspepsia while a young man in college
and found relief by leaving off coffee,'
often told me he was satisfied my head- j
aches were caused by coffee, so I gave j
up the coffee and took up Postum Cereal
Food Coffee. The change taught me in I
a most convincing manner that coffee
was the cause of the headaches, but now
I have an equally good coffee in Pos-
tum, and its health-giving properties
are simply undeniable. Our little chil-
dren use Postum regularly and go off to I
school as healthy and happy as children i
should. If ever husband or myself take j
a drink of weak coffee at an evening i
gathering or church social we are kept I
awake until past the middle of the night. I
Yours for health." |

POLICE AVERT
WELL PLANNED
JAIL DELIVER!
Saws and Opium in
Prison Yard.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 9.
A well matured plot to effect a whole-
Bale Jail delivery at the City Prison was
frustrated to-day by the discovery of a
full -complement of sawa and necessary
tools that .were to have been smuggled
into the prison.
It was a chance discovery made by Po
lice Captain Wilson. The captain was at
tending a trial in the Police Court on the
second floor of the City Hall, when hta
attention was attracted by a peculiar
noise in the jail yard at the rpar of the
building. Opening a window off thÂ« jury
room, he saw a package that had b*en
thrown over the nigh fence by unknown
parties and which had alighted on one
of the ledges running along the walls of
the building juet above the prison.
With the assistance of Officer Curtis,
the day jailer, the package was secured.
It contained two fine steel Â«aw 9 and a
considerable quantity of opium.
It is supposed that the package was to
be secured: by certain prisoners during
their exercise hour in the yard.
Some of the toughest crooks that ever
infested this city are at present lodged
in tho City Prison. . ;
WEAVER WORKING
IN A NEW FIELD
Notorious "Commodore"
Now at Samoa.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
APIA, Samoa. Jan. 10.â The Eliza Miller,
laden with lumber and a general cargo, is
now lying here discharging. It is rumored
that Captain Tllley and Mr. Chambers,
one of the engineer officers stationed at
Tutuila, have assumed direction of affairs
up. there. If they have done so they have
probably exceeded their authority, as no
transfer has yet taken place nor has any
public notice been given out that political
changes have been made or how they are
to operate. The prospects for a good trade
next season are excellent, and most per-
Bons look hopefully forward and fully ex
pect that the new officials will do all trey
can to make this part of the Emperor s
territories prosperous and peaceful.
The notorious "Commodore" N. J.

the high seas was recently published in
The Sunday Call, has made his appear
ance at Apia. With his usual facility for
impressing strangers he appears to nave

the letter of a correspondent will prove

vessel is certainly the finest craft of her size

Commodore Weaver, after investigating the
cacao business here and after interviewing tne
different authorities, many whites and numer
ous natives of importance, decided to start
here probably the largest and most complet*
cacao rlantatlon In the whole world. About
SOOO acres of land, situated ten miles east or
Apia, haa been secured, and contracts for the
preliminary clearing of the place will be imme
diately let, and no doubt other lands up to 10.000
or 12.000 acres In all will be secured. The prop
erty ie traversed by numerous ninnlng streams,
and several fine falls supply unlimited power.
The valley which has been secured is composed
of a rich alluvial Â¦ soil, and Is almost level.

Yellowtail, Advance Guard

To-Day.
Nothing was talked about at Oakland

demerit of this or that one. Under the
changed conditions, with F. "W. Brode
picking up 3 pounds additional and Tel
lowtail being conceded 7 pounds, the re
sult looks quite as doubtful as It did on
Thursday previous to the race. It is ar
gued that carrying 110 pounds Yellowtall
will cover the distance (one mile) In 1:39
flat. If he does the big fellow will win.
However, he came out of Thursday's race
badly distressed and may not be as sharp
as on that occasion. Alex Shields says
Advance Guard will be a better horse to
day and admirers of Brode look wise and
Bay, "His number was hung out the other
day, wasn't it?" It will assuredly result
in another superb test of speed and endur
ance. With the exception of onÂ© or two
throwdowns the talent fared very well.
Three favorites were turned down, but as
In each instance the winner was well
backed the books did not profit to any
great extent.
Lady Britannic, a 5 to 1 chance, backed
down to 3H. captured the opening mile
selling run. The black mare was ridden
by Jack Martin and after making all the
running won hard ridden from the 4 to S
choice, Tempo. Los Prletos finished In the
show.
Jenkins, astride the 7 to 10 favorite. Es
sence, played in rare good luck in the
mile selling affair next decided. Getting
away absolutely last, he trailed his field
to the stretch turn. Skirting the rail Bull
man, on Stuttgart, failed to Impede his
progress, and In a hard drive downed
Glengaber a neck, Stuttgart being only a
head further away.
Another warm choice was served up in
Florablrd for the seven furlong number,
with a bunch of seven starting. The Flor
ist colt stood plenty of urging, finally win
ning handily from Mont Eagle. Mission
tired badly, losing third place to Slsquoc.
For the first six furlong sprint Good
Hope received such steady support at 11
to 5 that the odds against Jingle Jingle,
the favorite, receded to the same figure.
It proved a false scare, for Bullman took
the latter away in the lead and, never
headed, downed Montallade half a length.

State o? Cal Portland Feb. 13rendered and canceled said notes, and that
thereupon said Scheld secreted or disposed of
paid money, except the sum of about $300, in
some manner unknown to Bald creditors.
One of the saddest things in connection
with the whole affair Is that, after the
death of his father, v.hich he witnessed,
Glueck's little boy died, the physicians
declaring that his death was due to the
nervous shock resulting from seeing his
father shot.
FAiMILY WRECKED BY DEATH
A sensational suit was filed yesterday
in the United States District Court by
Mrs. Johanna Glueck, who accuses Adolph
Scheld, son of the millionaire brewer, of
fraud, to escape paying for the life of her
husband, whom Scheld killed. Ine de
fendant seeks to be declared an insolvent,
and Mrs. Glueck swears he has hidden
his property. One of the saddest incidents
in this, the sequel of a tragedy, was the
death of Glueck's eldest son, who died
from the shock of witnessing his father's
death. --Â¦Â¦- : - --'Â¦-
ANniE FSSHER
A MOTHER seated at the win

in death, a daughter in bed in
the same room almost insane
with drink and a son huddled up in
a corner of another room in a drunk
en stupor was the sight that greeted
the eyes of Policemen Tyrrell and
McCormack Thursday night when
they entered the three-roomed house
at 11 Sherwood place. The house was
occupied by Mrs. Catharine Fisher
and her son and daughter, Ferdinand
and Annie, the son being about 44
years of age and the daughter 38.
Mrs. Fisher was about 70 years of age
and had been for years a sufferer
from asthma.

and a large fuse lying on the floor along
side it. v
The thieves effected an entrance to thÂ«Â»
place by prying open the back door with a
Jimmy. The safe was situated in one cor
ner of the store, so far from the street
that It would be almost impossible to hear
the noise of the drill from the outside.
Falling in their efforts to break into the
safe, which contained a large amount of
money, the burglars turned their atten
tion to the cash register, relieving it of
$12 in silver. In their hurry to get away
from the place the thieves did not neglect
to cart off about 200 choice cigars and a
bag containing 100 cent pieces.
The proprietors of the store are Inclined
to believe that the would-be safe-crackers
were well acquainted with the premises,
as the cent pieces were in a canvas bag
behind the counter, where nobody would
be liable to find them. They also believe
the burglars thought they were carrying
off a bag of $5 pieces. â¢ ' â¢

BIGGY USED A GUN ON A
VICIOUS CHINESE DOG
While Exploring the Dark Alleys in
Chinatown Many Discoveries
Were Made.
Last night Acting Chief of Police Biggy,
in company with Captain Wittman. ex
plored many alleys and places in China
town which are seldom viewed by the pub
lic. Their purpose was to locate "es
capes" to many of the buildings in which
are situated houses of ill fame and gam
bling dens. They were successful in most
instances and good work was accom
plished during the evening.
While in a dark yard inclosed by a fence
at the extreme end of Church alley the
officers were attacked by a vicious uog,
the property of one of the Mongolians.
Biggy's presence of mind saved some of
the party from injury, for when the act
ing Chief saw that the dog was almost
upon them he fired a shot from his re
volver for the purpose of frightening !t
away. The flash and report of the weapon
had the desired effect, and henceforwaid
the owner of the animal will keep it tied
up when officers are around.
One thing was strikingly demonstrated
to the acting Chief and police captain,
and revealed to them- how crime can be
committed and covered up in the Chinese
quarter. While the report of the pistol
was loud, still it was not heard on any of
the streets and created no commot'.on
which would lead any of the squads to
know that it had ever been fired.

the treaties being considered by this

ciprocity treaty he writes: "The French
opposition to the treaty is more apparent
than real. French politicians opposed to
the present Government of France are
against the treaty, as they are against
other administration measures, but I do
not think, from all that I can learn, that
the treaty will lack carrying strength
here. If the Americans injuriously affect
ed by the treaty were to leave its defeat
to the French they would make a serious
and probably fatal mistake."

STORY OF A TRAGEDY
TO BE TOLD IN COURT
Adolph Scheid Accused of Fraud to Escape
Paying for a Man's Life.
Sensational Action Instituted Against the Son of
the Millionaire Brewer in the Federal
District Court.
FrVT: years ago Axsc4ph P. Scheld.
the only son of Philip Scheld. a
millionaire brewer of Sacra^nento,
while eng-aged Jn target practice
sccldrnuUly shot and killed Frederick C.
Glueck. The anxiety and worry caused
by the legal entanglement that followed
LaÂ» clung to him even into the dawn of a
new century, as his opponents have now
renewed a battle in thÂ© United States
courts which will cause all former pro
ceedings to appear in the light of prelim
inary skirmishes.
lii a document filed yesterday At
torney I^aac Joseph of this city sets forth
allegations that in order to prevent the
payment of damages awarded by a Jury
Aaolph P. Scheid has resorted to prac
tices frowned upon by the law. Accord
ingly Attorney Joseph petition* Judge de
Haven not to grant Scheld a release from
insolvency proceedings, and the matter
will probably be referred to a referee in
bankruptcy.
In Mtu-ch, XS3S. Adolph P. Scheld was
engaged in target practice with a revol
ver in company with a friend named
Xicolaus on the* county road, about a half
mile distant from Sacramento, near a
t>ma.U roadside resort conducted by Fred
erick C. Oiueck. The saloon-keeper and
bis smiUl sou. Charles, ttood close by
watchlr.g the practice. While Beheld was
shcountf hie levolvtr got out of order,
fcjid a* is shown oy the transcript or tes
timony, lie snappea it several times with
the barrel pointed fat the ground and kept
snapping tlie naroaier as he lifted me
weapon to a horizontal position. As he
Cid so a cartridge exploded, the bullet en
tering the breast oi Giueck and killing
him almost instantly.
On June fc, lti'C, Johanna Oiueck, the
widow ot the unfortunate man, brought
suit for damages in the sum of J2S.WJ
against Schela in h<r own name and as
guardian for her husband's four minor
children. The case- wa& tried before a
jury, which finally oor eluded that the
charge of negligence haÂ«i beeu proved, and
on January I, I^7, rendered a verdict in
la.vor of trie plaintiff iv the sum of &i3ou.
Jt is asserted that several times during
the progress of the case Scbeld tried to
compromise mattcis. at one time offering
S2Â£K/ in settlement of the claim, but that
sis negotiations v/ere about to b* closed he
withdrew his offer in each instance.
From the decision cf the jury Scheld
took an appeal to the Supreme Court,
v.hich handed down in July last a de
cision affirming ike verdict of the jury-
After the vordict was affirmed by the Su
preme Court Sch^ld filed a petition in m
tolvency. According to the statement of
Attorney Josepn, the defendant, through
his lawyers, offered to compromise me
case for JT-Oi, a cay or two before he filed
the petition in bankruptcy, stating at the
time the offer was made that, if it were
not accepted, he intended "going tnrougn
Insolvency.? The offer was refused and
the threat was mruie good.
When the petition was tiled there were
ni> liabilities besides the JoOuO damages
awarded the widow, and the only asset
named subject to execution was an un
divided half intfrest in mining stock val
ued at $20<i.
The original petition was filed in Octo
ber cf last year, ar.d on January 19 of
the present year ScheiS filed another peti
tion for his final release from further
proceedings. February 1 Â¦was named as
the day tor a hearing-, and at that time
Attorney Joseph procured an extension
of time until to-<iay. in which to file a
written objection, technically called an
opposition. This opposition, with the sig
nature of Mrs. G'.ueck appended, was Sled
s'e^terday.
The first allegation In th<> opposition is
that Scheld made false oath? in the veri
fication of his petition in Issolvencyj par
ticularly with regard to schedule* B, in
Â¦which he nrore that he had made a cor
rect statement of all his ival and personal
property. Jt is further alleged that at th-Â»
Time of filmg 1 the petition he was pof
eeFse-d of pictures valued at $50, not ex
empt from execution, ard $500 in cash
which he did not include in schedule B
The second allegation is that. In antici- ;
pation of insolvency proceedings. Scheld
failed to keep books of account frr-rn
whioh Ms true financial status might be
escertair!Â«d. By far tl.e most sensational
allegation, boweverj is the third and la<t,
the language of which is as follows:
That saM crwlitor* are informed and be
lieve at.d therefore all^ir* that about the month
of Septf-mb<Â»r. IS9S. said Schcld was pntwsEed

others or.c \V. \V. Chaplnâ without considera
tion, a numlx?r of promissory notes, the dates
and amounts nt whifh are unknown to said
creditors, with the i.-tent and the purpose and
with an had with said friends,
and rartioularly with said Chai>ln. that false
and fraudulent claims based thoreon phouM
be presented in the bankruptcy proceeUin(?ii
about to be instituted by Â«ald Beheld Jn the
United States rÂ»iBtrict Court, and that, there
by, the said creditors opposing the ea'd dis
charge should be defrauded of their Just pro
rata of caid sum of $2000, after the payment
at all proper allowances made out of said
funds in said bankruptcy proceedings; that
raid friends, after reeciving Raid notes., realiz

Beheld proposed that they should commit, rur-
and Tuesday afternoons for. the purpose
of ascertaining which classes are to be
consolidated, and as a- result at least
sixty teachers will lose their positions.
Classes in the primary schools having
less than fifty in the grammar classes are
to be consolidated in accordance with the
rules of the board.
. Chairman Mark denies that any whole
sale removal is contemplated, while ad
mitting that the policy of the board is to
reduce the number of teachers in the in
terest of economy. The board, he says,
has visited several schools, and where It
was : found necessary the classes were
consolidated and several teachers have
already been placed on ' the unasslgned
list. Others are to follow.
Superintendent Webster is not in favor
of consolidating the classes out. He is
rather of the opinion that the depart
ment is in urgent need of extra teachers.
He believes that by increasing the num.
ber of pupils in the classes or placing
more than one grade in the one class im
pairs the efficiency thereof.
"It is a difficult matter," said Mr. Web
ster, "to apply a mathematical rule to
the number of pupils in a class. While it

requisite number, I question the advisa-
