ing the public into its confidence.
As Is only natural, countless rumors
have been circulated In the absence of
trustworthy intelligence. Tales of Brit
ish victory and a decisive Boer defeat
were coupled in the same breath almost
with stories of Buller having been re
pulsed by Boers and the British being In
retreat London newspapers, be it said
to their credit, took no notice of these
wild rumors, not one of them appearing
in print.
No day in . London during the whole
progress of the war has been quite like
yesterday. The news contained in Bul
ler's messaee that the intended assaulf
upon Spion Kop on Tuesday night was
enough of itself to keep all minds on the
rack of anxiety and feverish excitement.
Toward evening vague rumors were
abroad, such", as are usually the fruit of
a period cf suspense, when a chance ut
terance is magnified Into an authorita
tive statement and a surmise is mistaken
for a certainty. Among other things said
were that the attack had failed; that
Buller's statement was intended as a
blind and his real Intention was wholly
different, and that he would never have
?aid so much unless he was practically
sure of success. .
From early morning until midnight the
War Oftlce was thronged by visitors. To
make matters worse there is not a single
item of official intelligence from the front
to appease the widespread and breathless
anxiety. At midnight the announcement
was made at the War Office that the au
thorities had nothing to communicate to
the public, which at once suggested the
Idea that they had received something in
tended only for private information.
The attack upon Spion Kop would prob
ably be simultaneously delivered from two
sides, from Trlchards Drift and from Pot
gieters Drift by Warren'a division and
Lyttelton's brigade. During the last few
days there has been an almost continuous
bombardment of the Boer position as a
preliminary- to the advance.
The British force available for an as
sault would be about 20,000 men. All these
LONDON, Jan. 25.â The War Office has just issued the follow
lo wing dispatch from Speannans Camp, dated January 25, 12:10
a. m. :
"General Warren's troops last night occupied Spion Kop, sur
prising the small garrison which fled. It has been held by us all day
though vrt -were heavily attacked, especially by a very annoying
shell fire.
"I fear our ca-ualties are considerable and I have to inform
you with regret that General Woodgate was dangerously wounded.
"General Warren is of the opinion that he has rendered the
enemy's position untenable. The men are splendid."
SPEARMANS CAMP, Tuesday, Jan. 23. 9:30 p. m.â The
British field artillery and howitzer shelled the enemy on
the crest of the ridge this morning. The infantry, under
excellent cover, kept up an effective rifle fire. The Boers re
signed a kopje, of which the British infantry took posses
sion. When retiring, the enemy sheltered themselves behind a
?tone wall on the slope of the konie. which they held for hours.
This afternoon they ran across the ravine. The British ar
tillery poured shrapnel and lyddite into them and the infantry
took the stone wall. The British casualty list was small.
LONDON; Jan. 24. â A dispatch to the Times from Spear
mans Camp, dated Tuesday, 9:30 p. m., says:
"The Boers to-day had more guns and are preparing to
fight almost interminably, having intrenched the ridges, which
stretch in an almost unbroken line from the Drakensberg many
miles eastward.
"Firing continued throughout the day. We have not ad
vanced any farther, but we threw up intrenchments during the
night, from behind which the musketry duel continued from
exactly the same position as yesterday."
The Daily Telegraph publishes the following dispatch from
Spearmans Farm, dated Tuesday. January 23, 9:30 p. m:
"On Monday Sir Charles Warren's force cannonaded and
fusilladed the Boer positions west of Spion Kop. near the Acton
Homes road. A lyddite battery co-operated with the Other bat
teries and Maxims. Certainly the fire was effective, causing the
enemy serious losses. The Boers, however, clung desperately
to their works, from which they are being- slowly driven. To
day the enemy fired their guns oftener, using also the captured
15-pounders with shrapnel. Our casualties were less to-day
than those of yesterday.
"Fighting began about 6 in the morning and continued
until dark, but there has been nothing like a general engage
ment. The big naval gxins assisted from Potgieters Drift in
shelling- the Boer positions."

GAGE BOWED BENEATH
THE RAILROAD ROD
The Extra Session Was Hatched
in a Conspiracy,
Southern Pacific Dictators Insist That
Balloting for Senator Must Begin
Next Tuesday.
X M approaching extra session of the Legislature is engag-
Jl â¢g general attention from men of affairs and the question
is naturally asked why and under what influences Governor
Gage issued the call. That the Governor of this State is a crea
ture of Dan Bunts and the exclusive political property of the Mexi
can is a fact admitted with the deepest humiliation, but nevertheless
without question. That Governor Gage will obey the will of Burns
is acknozclcdgcd, and that the extra session teas called at the com
mand of Burns no one doubts. But until yesterday the secret ma
nipulations of the conspirators were mysterious. Now they are pub
lic property and this morning they are presented.
The extra session of the State Legislature was born last zveck
in room 962 â the room of Jack Wright â at the Palace Hotel. In
this room Governor Gage, William F. Hcrrin, Dan Burns and Jack
Wright met to prepare the call for the extra session, outline their pol
icy and plan their campaign for the election of a United States Sen
ator. In that room the Governor of this State conspired with the
head of the laze department of the Southern Pacific Company, who
is a Democrat when he is not doing the politics of his employer. The
chief executive of California counseled in secret with the Sacra
mento division superintendent of the Southern Pacific Company,
who is also a Democrat.
The Governor called into the conference a man who has been
a defaulter in every public position of trust he ncr held except one,
and zvith these precious advisers Governor Gage determined to sad
dle the State zvith great expense, make the people of California the
spectators of an indecent spectacle at Sacramento and seek again to
lift a rascal into a position of honor. It zvas in this disgraceful way
that the Gcrvcrnor of California decided to call the extra session.
He became the tool and instrument of the men zvho constitute his
unofficial cabinet and dictate his Policy.
More than that, he submitted to the plan of campaign as they
outlined it for him. They determined that on Tuesday next bal
loting shall begin for United States Senator. They decided to cheat
the Federal lazy ivhich governs the election of United States Sena
tors and instead of waiting until the second Tuesday after reor
ganization to begin on the first Tuesday, assuming for their pur
poses that the election is not to be for an unexpired term, but for a
full term.
This is their scheme, and they are determined that it shall not
be defeated. They also discussed the chances of electing Burns as
Senator. As a matter of course, he is their first choice, and noth
ing, discreditable or otherwise, zvill be left undone to elect him. But
if he Cannot be elected, then ihe forces of the conspirators zi-ill be
turned to Van R. Patcrson, the second choice of the railroad. If
again failure rezvards the scheme, then Irving M. Scott will be
thrown into the fight, and after him M. H. de Young. In this way
a cheap executive, scheming railroad manipulators and a rascal
have laid out the work for the extraordinary session of the Legisla
ture.
IN the camp of D. 11 Burns there \s a
scheme under consideration to begin
the balloting for United States Sena
tor as soon as the Legislature con
venes. The point la raised that the
Legislature is already organized and
The claim that the Legislature Is al
ready organized and ready for work will
place on the payroll the entire array of
attaches engaged for service at the reg
ular session. Members have already re
ceived notice that the clerks, porters,
watchmen and attendants from Slsklyou
to San Diego will be at the Capitol next
Monday and demand mileage for their at
tendance. Under the Belshaw law tha
number of clerks and attaches which each
house may employ is designated, hence
the contention that the attaches engaged
at the regular session are statutory offi
cers and therefore entitled to mileage.
When the Legislature convenes steps will
be immediately taken to diminish the
number of clerks and other attaches.
therefore the Federal statute relating to
the election of United States Senators will
not be violated If the voting should begin
immediately. Until recently it was. ac
knowledged by all factions that a ballot
could not be taken until the second Tues
day 1 after the organization. Under the
proclamation issued by Governor Cfage
convening the Legislature on January 29.
and assuming that organization will be
effected on, the day that the Legislature
convenes, the first ballot may be taken
on Tuesday, February 6. The railroad
scheme is to begin the voting for Senator
before members .from certain remote dis
tricts can reach Sacramento.
Men prominent In the Burns faction will
not. admit that such a scheme Is In con
templation, but they will not authorize a
* .
Assemblyman Owen Wade of Napa, who
came down from the valley last evening
to see M. M. Estee on law business, be
lieves that the old army of attaches will
rally at Sacramento next Monday and
that steps must be taken early In the ses
sion to lessen the number. He entertains
the view that committees as established
statement to the contrary. It was ascer
tained yesterday that the Burns men
propose to meet in this city next Saturday
and consider the subject. If precedents
can be found for immediate action they
will advocate balloting on the first day of
the session. Judge Dibble. In looking up
the precedents, has found how the Fed
eral statute was construed in the Stone
man extra session, when A. P. "Williams
was elected Senator to succeed George
Hearst. Governor Stoneman convened
the Legislature in extra session on Wed
nesday, and therefore nearly three weeks
elapsed before the balloting for Senator
began.
In the Faulkner case of "West Virginia,
wherein the right to elect a'Senator at a
special session of the Legislature was dis
puted, the fact was established In the pro
ceedings that the Legislature did not bal
lot until the second Tuesday after the
Legislature convened. Precedents or no
precedents, the anti-boss forces of tha
California Legislature are strong enough
to prevent any snap Judgment by the fol
lowers of Burns and Herrln. The impres
sion, that Democrats â¢will Join the Re
publican bosses to carry out a scheme in
opposition to the spirit of the Federal law
Is not well founded.
The Federal statute relating to special
sessions of the Legislature requires that
balloting for United States Senator to fill
un unexplred term must begin on the sec
ond Tuesday after the organization of the
Legislature. The Burns men lay stress on
che words "unexpired term." holding that
che election now in view is not to flll an
unexpired term, but a full term of six
years, and that the successful candidate
will draw pay for the term of six years
from March 4. ISOT. Burns is ready to
spring a point of this kind. He may
change his mind when he ascertains tha
sentiment of the people regarding sharp
dodges.

SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 24.â The local firm
of Groajean & Co., grrocerymen, seems to
exist largely for the benefit of clever
confidence operators. About a year ago
one Harrigran who claimed to be a rela
tive of the President, ran up a large
account there and skipped, and now Eric
Erlckson, a woodchopper, has pone back
to Sweden with $200 which he obtained
from the firm by a forged check. A
month ago Eric presented a check for $200
to Salvador - Pacheco, a member of the
firm. The check was indorsed by John
Enos, Erlckson's employer, a wealthy
â¢wood hauler, who became notorious in
connection with the "French Pete" mys
tery. Pacheco smilingly handed over the
coin and Erlckson walked away. Noth
ing more was thought of the matter till
yesterday, when Enos came to town and
Pacheco mentioned the transaction to
him. Then, too late, it was learned that
the wily Eric had forged his employer's
name.. A warrant was issued for Erick
eons' arrest, but with no result up to late
to-night.

what we all know In these black, gloomy
daysâ there would have been no war. It
Is dreadful but true that a want of fore
sight and decent Information led the Gov
ernment to stumble, lnto war in the dark.
Lord Salisbury's menacing speech of July
2S if applied to a great power, could only
have meant war. It was absurd, If the
Government really believed in a Dutch
conspiracy, to spend time in negotiations
regarding the franchise. The conspiracy
was an afterthought of the Government,
conjured up to make a hideous and ghast
ly blunder."
In conclusion, Mr. Morley declined to
commit himself as to what would happen
in the future, but he warned his hearers
not to be duped by the idea that the
Boers after defeat would settle -down
quietly. With reference to the point at
which the conflict would come to an end,
Mr. Morley observed: '
"Something depends on a chance, which
I hope is remote but ls certainly not in
visible, of our being called off to meet
dangers in other quarters."

NEW YORK, Jan. 25.â The Tribune haÃ
tho following from London: Nothinff is
yet known as to the result of General
Culler's night attack on Splon Kop. The
latest news from the scene of operations
in Natal is contained in a brief exchange
message dispatched from Hpearmans
iVan'.p at 9:30 o'clock on Tuesday night.
which says that General Warren was BUU
attacking and the Boer position was being
Eearched by a tei rifle fire from the Britisli
howitzers. A party of* British stretcher
bearers were fired upon, several being
.wounded.
Reuters correspondent dispatched a
telegram at the same time from spear
mans Camp showing Tuesday's operations
resulted in distinct advantage to General
Warren's forces. The British Held guns
had been reinforced by howitzers, which
quickly made effects of tho lyddite felt.
The Boers retired from the crest of their,
kopje and it was at once occupied by the
British troops. Later they wcro also
driven from a stone wall, which they had
held for hours and had to cross a ravine
under lyddite and shrapnel tire from the
British "artillery.
The statement was issued In Brussels
yesterday that General Warren's advance
had proved abortive, but so far as known
at present there was no need to attach
any importance to the pessimistic report.
General Mcthuen made a reconnoisaance
on Monday toward the Boer position at
Magersfonteln. The infantry retired at
dusk, but the British big guns during the
night and in the early morning Tuesday
fired a number of shells against the Boer
position, blowing up. 11 Is believed, a
magazne or black powder.
Reuters dispatches from Klmberley
give some interesting details of, the ser
vices rendered the garrison and town by
Cecil Rhodes and the DC Beers Company
and describe the bombardment as carried
on by Boers last Tuesday with great per
tinacity, but with no casualties on tho
British side. The thirty-pounder gun cast
by the De Beers Company is reported to
be shooting capitally and Mr. Rhodes
himself has fired several shots.

MABINI'S PLEA
IS LAID ASIDE
Cannot Be Heard Until
Aguinaldo Surrenders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 24.â The proposi
tion made through the New York Herald
by the Filipino leader, Senor Mablni, for
a civil commission to treat with the Fil
ipinos, will not be considered by the ad
ministration until Aguinaldo surrenders,
and In official circles the general disposi
tion is to regard Mablnl's request aa
another play for delay.
It Is the purpose of President McKlnley
tO Inaugurate a Civil government to super
sede military rule In the Philippines at
the earliest possible moment, and he is fa
vorably Inclined toward a commission In
lieu of a Governor General, and is dis
cussing the question of available men for
such a commission.
In addition to a commission for the
government of the islands it is not un
likely that Congress will appoint a joint
commission to investigate the islands
next summer and report to the next ses
sion as a guide for future legislation.
A great deal of interest was manifested
in Congressional circles in the communi
cation from Senor Mabinl. There is some
diversity of opinion over the proposition
and its feasibility. Senator Hoar, leader
of the anti-administration forces in this
fight, was deeply Interested in the propo
sition.
"That Bounds fair and Just." said he
"and I do not see how such a proposition
can. be declined. As I understand all the
Filipinos ask is that Congress listen to
them before deciding their fate-."

POLYGAMY ASSAILED BY
CONGRESSMAN LANDIS
Argument on the Roberts Case a Bit
ter Denunciation of Mormon
Methods.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASH
INGTON, Jan. 24. â Brigham H. Roberts is to be turned out of the
House of Representatives to-morrow, without being allowed tO take
the oath of office. No definite agreement has yet been reached for a
vote to-morrow, but it is the general understanding that before the
House adjourns the vote will be taken, and all indications point to
the defeat of the minority resolution providing for the adminis
tration of the oath as a preliminary to expulsion and the adoption
of the majority resolution with, possibly, some modifications. Mr.
Roberts has persistently declared that he would continue the fight
if the action of the House should be adverse to him and will en
deavor to carry the case to the courts in some way. As the time for
final action by the House approaches he becomes less combative.
When I saw him to-night he said he had no idea of what he would
do, as he had not been able to make up his mind as to what course
was open to him.
:'*â¢Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦:'Â¦'
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24. â The second
day's debate in the Hou?c upon the Rob
erts case was leps dramatic than that of
yesterday. The galleries were almost
a? crowded, but the ladies nere less de
rrioiÂ»fctra.tive. The President's pastor,
liev. Dr. Bristol, was in the executive
ealiery the greater portion of the after
noon listening to the arguments. Mr. lt..b
erts was not present during the day. Had
he bet* he would have heard the most
scathing excoriation of the Mormons ever
delivered upon the floor of the House.
Mr. Landis of lndia.na. the young ora
idt who distinguished himself during the
last Congress in an oratorical duel with
Mr. Johnson of his State, won new lau
reis to-day. He charged that Utaii had
been admitted to the Union as a result
of a Mormon conspiracy, and reviewed
the history of the apostles of the church,
Â¦whom he charged with living in open and
flagrant violation of the law of the State
against polygamy, to show that they had
basely broken their solemn pledge to the
Government. The other speakers to-day
were IfessnL Powers (H.) of Vermont and
Miers <LÂ». Â» of Indiana, for the majority
resolution; Messrs. Snodgrass (D.) of
Tennessee and Wilson (Silver R.) of
Idaho for the minority resolution. Mr. La
cey (R.) Of lowa for his proposition to ex
pel without swearing in. and Mr. Crum
packer <R.) of Indiana for exclusion by a
iwo-thirds majority. The speeches to
day greatly strengthened the majority
resolutions, which seemed In danger of
failing after Mr. Littlefields speech yes
terday, and Chairman Tayler was confi
dent to-night that they would be adopted
when the House votes to-morrow after
noon.
Powers of Vermont was the first
Fpeaker. He argued in behalf of the ex
clusion of Roberts. The contention of the
minority for expulsion, he said, ran up
against tho very precedents cited in Ks
Mipport. It was the universal rule that a
member could not be expelled for an of
fense committed prior to election. \\ rule
it might be argued in Roberts' case that
polygamy K*a* a continuing status, the
crime ilsdf. the initial act, took place
long before Mr. Roberts was ejected.
"We are not separating wife from hus
band." *aid Powers, commenting on Rob
erts' epeech of yesterday. "Polygamy has
never been legal in Utah, eitner before
cr after her admission into the L'nlon. Po
lygamy was Illegal under the common law
of England. Trie moment he took wife
Ko. 2 the marriage whs void.
"Roberts knew the law. He cannot
row plead the "baby act' against the law
*tnd stern justice."
Snodgrajss of Tennessee followed Pow
ers, supporting the views of the minority
in favor of seating and then expelling
"If we were not to become the expo
rents of the French system of justice,"
he said, "which presumed guilt until in
nocence was proved, Roberts must be ac
corded his prlma facia right to his beat
lÂ»efore being -ousted."
Lanflis of Indiana, a member of the
Roberts committee, who signr-d the nu
{orttv report, argued that Ctah had vio
tled. her compact with the Unifnl States.
JLandis saJd he believed, and Roberts
had not denied, that Margaret C. Shipp
had become Roberts' plural wife since
I'tah was admitted, in 1 5 56. He paid a
high tribute to the Christian misÃionartoÃ
who had workt-d among the people of
Vtah. Roberts he said, had boasted that
he had received the votes of the Gentiles
in his district. That. Landis said, was be
cause he ran as a Democrat as well as a
Mormon, and because his opponent "f.ad
been a Danite who had killed his man."
Ijandih rv^errted as unworthy of belief
the rharee made. rwÂ» fcaid. by Senator
Â¦Kawlins that the President had appoin'.
c-d notorious polygamists to office. The
ppnator might as well accuse the Hou*e
of fnflorsing pplypamy. Plnce it had
passed a bill appropriating $40,000 for trie
agricultural college at l^ogan, Utah.
Continuing, Mr. L.andis sai<3:
The president of that college is a poiygamist,
livir.g in oi>en and notorious polygamy with
three wives. One of his leading professors is
a polygamlFt, living with two wives. The trus
tee Is a polyKamlst. livirp In op*-n and noto
riou* polygamy with *3VPn wives (laughter) and
they have blessed him with thirtx-nine children.
Tfcf President is innocent and we are Innocent,
because we jiut faith in the pledge and promifce
Ot the pious covenant breakers. (Applause and
lauthter.)
Paces must be written of the violation Of
the compact by wMch I'iah was tlven a rtar.
Ah, Mr. S;>eaker. that i=tar lt> a fallen star; it
CJrÂ»es not F.hlne with the brilliancy and luster
of her sister stars It chine? by cunning and
deceit, by treachery", by fraud. It speaks of
critte and of* violation of the moi-t solemn
covenant ever made between Territory and the
Union. (Arrlause.)
We have as a Representative from Utah a
man with three wives, the last one taken, the
report says, a* near as we can ascertain, be
fore 1*5(0. It Is In evidence that he did not
. hold her out a* his wife, nor Ehe him c* her
husband until 1R97. l*p to 1595 she lived under
the name of Shlpp and under the roof of Shipp.
I don't believe If any marriage ceremony wu
ever â¢olemnized that It was solemnized prior
to 183Â«. I believe, and he did not deny, that
that woman became his plural wife after Utah
was taken Into the American Union. And 1
eharre here that Utah came In as the result of
a deliberate conspiracy to free that people from
the hea\-y hand of the Federal authority and
then enable them to live their religion un
hindered. In ISJS Mr. Roberts was a candidate
for Congress and the church disciplined and de
feated him, because the time wag not then ripe
, for a poiycamist to come to the American Con
greys. He became a candidate In ISSB and the
man who placed him before the convention said
j that he ran by tK-rminsion of the church. In

I attention to the polyKamist, has stood in his
j path, has scattered thor&J along his way, and

Lacey of lowa argued in behalf of his
proposition for the expulsion of Roberts
without swearing him In. - Miers of Indi
ana supported the. majority resolution.
Clark of Missouri interrupted to say
â¢that if he had been Roberts* legal ad
viser he would have had him on the first
day of the session object to every member
whose name was on the roll. He would
have had the whole concern "In the hole."
Raid Clark; "but," he added, "i was
neither his legal nor spiritual adviser."
Lacey combatted this statement, argu
ing: that the members on the roll could
have passed upon each objection. MierÂ»
of Indiana, a member of the special com
mittee, supported the majority resolu-
tlon. He denied vigorously that the peo
ple of UtaK were to be charged with dis
loyalty to their compact with the Union.
So far as the State was concerned polyg
amy, he fald. was dead.
Mcl'herson of lowa, another member of
the committee, also advocated the adop
tion of the majority report. He said the
minority could not sneer down the objec
tion to Roberts' admission on the ground
that Utah had violated her compact with
the United States, and quoted a decision
of the late Justice Chase to the effect that
a State could violate her compact to 6uch
an extent that Congress could deny her
representation. McPherson declared that
once seated Roberts could never be ex
pelled. He devoted much of his time to
answering the argument of Littlefleld. At
times he was exceedingly caustic.
Crumpacker of Indiana was unable to
agree with the resolutions of either
branch of the committee. He wanted the
majority report amended so as to require
a two-thirds vote to adopt it.
Wilson of Idaho challenged some of tho
statements made against the Mormon peo
ple. He eaid he represented 30,000 Mor
mons and that In all that made good citi
senshlp they were the equal of any con
stituency in the country. He affirmed
that the Mormon church abandoned polyg
amy as a doctrine In 1890 In good faith,
and he believed the' people had lived up
to their promise. Upon his responsibil
ity as a member he stated that polygamy
was not being entered into in Idaho, and
the church had recently Issued a procla
mation against it, which he had read. He
was opposed to polypamy as much as any
member and he repudiated the statement
that the church was teaching, advocating
or advising Its practice. At 6:15 p. m. the
House adjourned.

2by The Call correspondent to-day if he
had heard that an extra session of the
California Legislature had been called.
Judge Barham said: "yes, I have been
informed that Governor Gage has called
an extra session. I sinceroly hope that
among others the duties which they will
perform will be to elect a United States
Senator. I am a candidate for Senator,
and if the people, through their Legis
lature, shall see fit to elect me, I shall
discharge the duties of tho ofilce accord
ing to the best of my ability. I hope my
course in Congress warrants the belief
that I have, and If elected to the Senate
I will, without fear, favor or discrimina
tion,, advocate and defend proper legisla
tion, and disapprove and do what lies In
my power to defeat bad legislation.
"How do I stand with the railroad? I
do not know; but because I have done
right I feel that that interest should ap
provo my course. I have no prejudice
against any interest in this country nor
have 1 ever opposed or advocated any
measure for that reason. I opposed, from
a conscientious belief that it was wrong,
the Powers funding bill, a measure to
fund said road's Indebtedness. I took an
active position against that bill and made
four speeches. The bill was defeated by
a large vote. In the succeeding Congress
the question of how to settle that indebt
edness again can\e before Congress. A
bill was introduced by Senator Morgan
and received the consent and approval
of Senators White and Perkins. It pass
ed the Senate and came to the House. I
did not think the bill met the require
ments of the situation and I framed an
amendment, which, with the bill, passed.
The whole question was settled thereby,
the Government received its money and
the question no longer exists. In my op
position to the Powers funding bill
I Incurred the disfavor of the railroad
people. In advocating the amendment to
the Morgan bill I also met their disap
proval; b.ut I feel satisfied with my course
on both measures and received the ap
proval of the people each time by an in
creased vote. My position on these meas
ures was not because of any feeling I had
against the railroad or to any one con
nected with It. The course taken was
dictated by my best judgment. My ad
vocacy of the Nicaragua canal has not
been because of any prejudice against the
railroad Interest, because, while I believe
the whole people demand the canal, I
also believe that it is for the best Inter
ests of the railroad that it should be con
structed. I am glad to say that In my
Judgment the canal will be built and that
the bill now pending wilj pass at this ses
sion. I want it distinctly understood that
at all times during my ofllcial life I shall
be governed in my action by my best
judgment. Unless the people desire my
election 1 certainly do not want to be
elected. I submit my candidacy to the
consideration of the Legislature and I
ehall be entirely satisfied with their
choice." %. -
REPUBLICAN RANKS WILL

BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 24.â The Mnmfntr
Echo, Senator C. Smith's paper, touching
the question as to a caucus, relative io
choosing a United States Senator by tho
Legislature, will say in the morning:
"A question very frequently asked is.
Will there be a party caucus on the Sen
atorial question when the Legislature
meets? This question no member of the
Legislature should undertake to answer
until he has conferred with other mem
bers and learned the probable result of
such a meeting. In some of the Eastern
States the holding of a caucus has been
so long the practice that it has become
well nigh a party rule. But such is not the
case in the West. It Is recalled that In
1895 the very men who are now clamoring
for a caucus refused to attend one or al
low their political followers to attend.
Colonel Burns, for Instance, was opposing
Senator Perkins and none of his "Burns"
followers attended the caucus because

WASHINGTON, Jan. 34.â The members |
of the Xational Board of Trade called at '
the White House to-day and paid their re- ;
specta to the President. Governor Stan
nnrtl, the chairman pro tempore, speaking
on behalf of the board, delivered an ex
tended address to the President, in which
he outlined the desires and purposes of
the board, concluding In these words:
We congratulate you. Mr. President, upon the
prosperity of the country and the success of
yuur administration.
In replying the President said:
I cannot conceal the pleasure It grlves me and
the honor I feel in this call on the part of the
National Board of Trade, representing as it |
doea great and varied and important interests |
of our country. I rejoice with you all upon our j
universal prosperity and I trust that that pros
perity may be long continued to the American
peopfe. Its continuance will very much depend
on the Wisdom and conservatism of the business
men of the United States. We shall rely upon
them to help us solve the great and momentous
problems to which your chairman has referred,
In the hope that their settlement may not only
be to the highest interest of the American peo- i
pie. but for the highest good of those who by ,
the fortune of war have come within our Juris
diction and care. :
At a business meeting- held subsequent
to the visit the fellowing resolution re
spectinp our merchant marine wa3
adopted:
Whereas, United States vessels In 1826 carried
32 per cent of the nation's Imports and exports.
SI per cent in 1545, 75 per cent in ISS6 and only 8
per cent in 1533. showing a lamentable decline
in our merchant marine in the foreign trade, j
owing to the fact that It Is conducted on a free I
trade basis; and
Whereas. The tonnage of vessels In the coagt
injc trade In which foreign competition la an-
Bolutely forbidden increased from 722.230 In 1826
to 1 223,218 in 1545, and to 2,247,663 in ISS6. and
to 3.953.513 In 1599. thUB demonstrating the abll
tty of this country to meet all Its needs in the
matter of shipping when properly protected;
Whereas. The United States Is now paying to
forelsn eh!p owners nearly J200.000.000 annually
to do our Mean carrying trade, which sum In
creases yearly; and
Whereas, . The enormous decline in our ocean
merchant marine Is due to the lower wages
paid abroad and to the subsidies paid by foreign
Governments, Great Britain alone, according to
Document N"o. 4TO. Miscellaneous Series, tesued
by the British Government, paying last
year 53.266.350 In "postal subsidies" and $:33.<305
additional to tHe game steamship lines In
"naval subventions," whil* for wages alone
the cost of operating* an American 9hip Is aj
most exactly one and a half times tne cost of
operating a similar British ship, and the differ
ence in wages Rives s>*eat!y Increased advan
tajres to foreigners in every way. Including
lower ccst in ttie. construction of shlpsi fuid
Whereas. The protective clause should be ex
tended to our shipping In the foreign trade
that It may be bu!it up, aa has been done In
the case of other industries, including our
coastwise shipping; and
Whereas. The profitable employment of the
surplus productive rower of the farms, fac
tories, mines, forests and fisheries of the United
States imperatively demands the Increase of its
foreigrn commerce; and
Whereas. The merchant vessels, officers, en-
Ktneers. machinists, electricians and seamen
necessary to the Increase of the commerce of
the United States are also essential as auxiliary
to the forces of the United States In time of
war and otherwise tend to the better security
of the nation and to the protection of its pos
sessions: and
Whereas, It Is deemed especially expedient
to make Immediate provision to th?se ends.
Therefore, This memorial of the National
Boanl of Trade. assembled In Washington,
January 23, ISUQ. respectfully presents to the
of the United States \hat the delegates now
here, rc-presentng all sections of our country,
find it to be a matter of supreme interest that
our foreign exports have now reached the
larerest figures ever known and offer further
opportunities for Increase in still other fields.
To give force and emphasla to these opportu
nities, and to Rive some permanency to the
exceptional advantages of th>? past year, this
country needs a revival of Its merchant ma
rine.
Your memorialists, the N'atlonal Board of
Senate bill or the Payne House bill will be
effective to this end. The principles embodied
in these bills have met the approval of the
President of the United States, the Secretary
of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Nay-
Iftation. and they have be*n Indorsed by near
ly every trade and commercial organization in
the country and by the press to an extent
which fhows an overwhelming sentiment in
their favor.
The argument for an American merchant ma
rine has had the further distinct recommenda
tion of foreign delegates to the recent export
convention as essential for the further cement-

during the regular session will not be re
organized for the special session. It Is
obvious that the first big struggle of the
special session will be in the direction of
cutting down the immense force of at
taches.
In the proclamation convening the Leg
islature In Fpecial session the Governor
made no mention of appropriation meas
ures to pay the contingent expenses of
the Senate and Assembly. Members hold
that the allowances in the general appro
priation bill for the two fiscal years be
ginning July 1, ISM. may he used to de
fray incidental expenses of the extra ses
sion, and therefore it will not be nÂ»c3
sary to send to the Governor a series of
contingent expense bills. When the
plungers now preparing to visit S.iera
mento get through with the work outlined
there will be very little money left of the
amount set apart to meet the expenses
of the regular session, which begins In
January. 1901.
Advices received by wire from Wash
ington, D. C. confirm the story that John
A. Barham. member of Congress repre
senting the First District. Is an aspircnt
for the office of United States Senator.
His interePtÃ at Sacramento have been
entrusted to the care of Postmaster L#em
mon of Santa Rosa. Senator Gillette of
Humboldt and Assemblyman Le Haron
of Sonoma. Under the protecting wing
of rx-Asscmblyman Price, Mr. Le Baron
managed to pass through the trials of thÂ«Â«
last regular session. It was Robinson's
special duty to pee that Le Baron was
rot temfctod to Irave the camp of 11. S.
Grant, and he fulfilled his mission to the
satisfaction of Grant's managers. If he
received any other reward than that of
his own conscience Milton Green has not
mentioned it publicly.
The current rumor that the fifty-five
resolute Republican members of the Leg
islature who could not be- persuaded or
coerced to vote for Dan Burns during: the
regular session last winter have resolved
to meet and confer regarding a candidate
to be supported at the extra session has
excited Indignation in the corral of Burns.
The friends of the colonel designate the
proposed conference as a "bobtailed cau
cus." In the vernacular of politics a
"bobtailed caucus" means a conference
from which tho minority is excluded. One
of the followers of the colonel made this
remark yesterday: "If the opponents of
Colonel Burns Ret topether and attempt
to select a candidate for the regular cau
cus without consulting the minority, I for
one will go in to smash the whole caucus
proposition. Then we will flpht it out on
the iloor of the joint convention. Admit
for example that tho anti-Burns men can
get forty-three members to so into a bob
tailed caucus, admit that they agree on
a plan to drop the lowest candidate on
each ballot, and what is the result? Why,
a majority of 43â twenty-two members of
the Legislatureâ name the Senator. The
forty-three members bound by a confer
ence in which the minority was not al
lowed to participate could enter the reg
ular caucus and name the candidate for
Senator. The friends of Colonel Burns
will never submit to such a proceeding.
There must be a caucus in which every
Republican member is allowed to enter
or no caucus at all."
While the supportrrs of Burns nr<? cry-
Ing out against a conference of the Inde
pendent anti-boss members of the Legis
lature they are planning for a secret con
ference In this city to be held before the
members committed to the cause of the
Mexican go to Sacramento. At this secret
gathering they will resolve to stand by
Burns until he throws up his hands. The
hint is already given that the colonel
will not keep them long In suspense. They
are advised that the colonel will give the
signal, to go to Barnes, Pillsbury, Scott or
Paterson whenever he finds his own cause
hopeless.

FRUIT SHIPPERS PLEASED.
Switzerland's Open Door Promises a
Large Benefit to California,
So They Think.
Morris Marks of England, who has paid
much attention to the means employed to
increase the sale of California products
in Europe, said yesterday that the free
admission Â¦of California dried fruits by
Switzerland, as reported by wire, would
mean a great extension of the markets for
California. There had been a great in
crease in the consumption of the Califor
nia goods in Germany during the past few
years. Notwithstanding the nearness of
Italy and France to Switzerland, the Cali
fornia goods would be able to make sharp
competition and hold/ their own if the
news should prove to be correct. Mr.
Marks has just started for England and
this Interview was had on the eve of
his departure.
The views expressed by Mr. Marks are
largely shared by local dealers In dried
fruits. Perhaps Switzerland might be
counted upon to take half as many goods
as Germany. Some reference to figures
throws cheerful light on the proposition.
B. N. Rowley, compiling the statistics
that he has received from seventeen ship
pers of cured fruits direct from Califor
nia to England and the Continent during
the season of 1899, ending December 31,
reports that there went directly abroad
in that period 11,012 cars, or a total of
26,642,805 pounds, the carloads being esti
mated on the basis of twelve tons each.
The value of the goods at current rates
would be $1,149,536. Germany on that es
timate purchased directly half a million
dollars' worth of dried fruits. Mr. Marks
thinks that the amount can be safely mul
tiplied by twenty, to make the showing
that will be realized within a very few
years. Switzerland might easily become
worth millions of dollars annually to Cali
fornia. The dried fruit men are eagerly
waiting for the particulars concerning
the reported move of Switzerland.

TITLE AND GUARANTY
COMPANIES MUST PAY
ALLEGATION THAT THE WAB
TAX IS BEING EVADED.
Collector Ljoich Investigating the
Matter by Order of Internal
Be venue Commissioner
Wilson.
Internal Revenue Collector John C.
Lynch has been ordered by Interval Rev
enue Commissioner Wilson at "Washington
to investigate alleged failures of title and
guaranty insurance companies to pay
their share of the war revenue by affix
ing to their documents the requisite
stamps representing the tax accruing on
the premium charge for such insurance or
guarantyship.
In his letter to Mr. Lynch, Commission
er Wilson says: "You are therefore re
quired to cause an investigation to be
made In your district looking to the deter
mination of whether or not such corpora
tions are complying with the provisions of
the act."
For the benefit of all parties concerned
the Commissioner calls attention to the
law requiring every person, firm, associa
tion, company, etc., transacting the busi
ness of insuring titles of real estate is
required to affix to each policy of insur
ance, bond or obligation stamps in the
amount of one-half of one per cent for
each dollar or fractional part thereof on
premium charged. Each contract or ap
plication executed by any such person,
association, company or corporation in
black shoes with large yellow eyeholes,
is subject to the same tax.
Struck the Wrong Woman.
Joseph Brothers, who lives on Brady

tending to chastise her, when he struck
Mrs. Katie Kennedy, who happened along
at the time. He was arrested for battery,
and in his defense told Judge Mogan
yesterday that he was waving his arms
to attract his wife's attention when he
accidentally struck Mrs. Kennedy. The
Judge convicted him and ordered him to
appear for sentence this morning.
VANITY FAIR
WINS FROM
PAT REILLY
Latter Proves a Surprise in
the Midweek Stake at
Union Park.
M. J. O'Neil's Trhite and brindlc grey
hound Pat Reilly furnished the surprise
yesterday at I'nion Coursing Park. He
defeated Ballroom Belle, Mountain Belle,
Bad Boy, who was a 12 to 1 favorite:
Ather.ia, a 3 to 1 favorite, and Narcissus,
who, it was thought, would win the stake
handily.
ll J at liellly met Vanity Fair In the final
and for a time it seemed he would be
beaten pointless. The representative of
the Curtis Kennels led him an indefinite
number of lengths. After a time rat
Rcilly gained possession of the hare and
when the <nd of the course came Judge
<Jrace declared Vanity Fair the winner
by a score of 12 to 9. The friends of Judge
P. J. Keilly played his namesake as a
matter of. sentiment and secured big re
turns for the money they Invested on
him. He was generally fortunate in his
various trials and was not run to a.
standstill as were some of the other com
petitors:. The hares were generally strong
and a number of long courses resulted.
J. H. Bosseter'fl Recording Angel was
given an oponing-up course after a long
rest, with Curtis & Son's Cavalier. The
later led up by two lengths. Recording
Angel will be "tried again Sunday after
noon with the celebrated For Freedom.

FIELD TRIALS
OF DOGS AT
BAKERSFIELD
All-Age Contest Not Finished
Owing to Disappearance .
of One Animal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKFHISFIELD, Jan. 24.â The all-age
run was begun this morning, but was not
finished, owing partially to the fact that
one of the dogs disappeared for almost an
hour, during which time the trials were
delayed. The work was done along tho
river bottom where the first day's Derby
was held, and birds were not found as
plentiful as yesterday near Stockdale. A
groat number of birds were found in the
timber, and not as good an exhibition of
range and speed was given as would have
been seen had the trials been held in more
open country.
The lirst brace cast off this morning -was
W. W. Van Arsdale's pointer Lucerne P,
H. S. Peach handler, and C. O'Neil's set
ter GJad Star, handled by Coutts. The
course was diagonally back and forward
across the river bottom until finally a few
birds were forced into the open, where
Lucerne made a nice, stanch point in a
bunch of cage. He dropped to flush, and
the dogs being ordered on both pointed a
short distance away, but no bird was
found. Gladstar. a short distance ahead,
made ajiother point, which was backed
by the pointer, but again no bird vras
Hushed. The dogs were then taken back
into the timber, where Gladstar secured
a point, which was honored by Lucerne,
and ttu: bird was flushed and killed by
Coutts, both dogs being steady to the shot.
A short distance ahead Gladstar pointed
again and the bird was flushed and the
dog was ordered on by his handler, but
he came to a point a few feet away,
which Coutts evidently did not see, and
on being ordered on again he broke the
point and the birds were flushed, a fact
which probably did not count against the
dogs.
After being down forty-five minutes this
brace was taken up and Seep of the
Stockdale kennels and Van Arsd.ile's
Peachmark were cast off. This was an
interesting heat, as most of it was run in
the open. The first point was made by
Peachmark in a bunch of willows, from
which several birds were flushed by the
handler. From this point the course wa
across the open llelds where both dogs
showed plenty of range and speed. The
next two points were claimed by the
handlers at almost the same moment.
Pearhmnrk pointed in a bunch of willows
and Seep on the- top of a little knell in
plain sight of the spectators. Both dogs
were steady to wing. The next point was
made by Peachmark in a ploughed field
at the edge of a ditch down which the
bird evidently ran, and was flushed by
the handkr some thirty feet away from
the dog. This brace was ordered up at
9:45.
Yosemite kennels' pointer. Buck of
Kent, and W. B. Coutts' setter Dick
Stamboul. wer^ next. They were cast off
in an open field, and loss than one hun
dred yarda away Stamboul dropped to a
point which was held stanchly enough
until the handlers moving up caused the
birds to run. when he became unsteady,
but was finally dropped at the command
of Coutts. Stamboul made a second point
across the creek bed at the edge of the
field, and the dogs were ordered back to
the wagons at 10:40.
Stockdale kennels' pointer Cuba of Ken
wood and C. B. Dwyer's setter Tacoma
were the next brace down, and although
they ran a very pretty race, neither did
the high-class work that was expected
from them. But one point each wa9
made during their heat, which lasted one
hour. At this time an adjournment was
taken for lunch.
After luncheon Stockdale kennels
pointer Kellle Wilson and Betten nnd
Truman's King of Blithe were cast off in
the most favorable ground for work dur
ing the day. The course was over rolling
hills, through short sage brush and corn
fields, and about half a mile distant a
bevy of birds were flushed, and scattered
in short cover. Here King secured a
point, which was honored by Nellie Wil
pon. The second point was secured a
short distance by Nellie, but in this case
King did not honor the point, and flushed
The two next points were secured by
Nellie, but on tne last of these she was
unsteady, and her handler could not pre
vent her breaking in on the bird.
A. Decourtieux's setter, Verona Cash,
that had drawn the bye. was then put
down for half an hour, which ended the
first series.
The first brace called for the second se
ries was Gladstar and Peachmark, who
went down at 3:07. The dogs were cast
off in the edge of the timber, and within
a few moments Star had pointed a single
bird in good style. Being ordered on
again, he disappeared, and repeated
whistling failed to bring him back. After
a few moments Peachmark was ordered
back to the wagon, and all the available
horsemen started in search of the dog,
but without result. It was almost an hour
before Gladstar saw fit to return. On his
coming back to the wagon the dogs were
ordered on again, and, as if endeavoring
to atone for his fault, Gladstar did some
excellent work in the next few minutes,
pointing several singles. The last brace
down were Stamboul and Tacoma: In
this heat but few birds were found. Ta
coma scored two points and Stamboul one.
They wore ordered up at 5:05. and the
running closed for the day.
The all-age stake will be continued to
morrow afternoon, after which a drawing
will be made for the champion stake. This
drawing in all probability will be made
in the field, and the running, or a part of
it, at least, will no doubt take place in
the afternoon, providing the all-age is
finished in tho morning.
The members' stake will be the last
event on the card and will from present
indications be held on Friday.
The annual meeting of the Field Trials
Club Â«cs held at 8:30 p. m. at the South
ern Hotel, and the following officers were
elected: W. S. Tovis, president: J. E.
Terry, first vice president; \V. W. Van

ROSINANTE
IS NEARLY
A MARVEL
one .Lowers a Coast Record in
Defeating PotenteâOak
land Results*
Nearly nine years ago Tristan, a turf
hero of the past, covered one mile 'and a
furlong over tho Morris Park course in
1:51^. It still stands as the American rec
ord and seems a difficult mark to shoot
at. Yesterday at Oakland track. Rosi
nante, the sunshine of Jimmy Coffey's
stable, ran the distance in 1:52 flat, creat
ing a new record for coast horses to
lower. Briar Sweet and Cromwell had
formerly traveled the route in I:s2ft. In
executing this feat, the white-faced chest
nut mare came from the trenches, after
looking hopelessly out of it, and nosed the
purse away from Potente, the warmest
thine of the afternoon's exercises. Tod
Walsh rode Potente, which was bung
started down from 9 to 5 to 6 to 5, and
after cutting out a fierce clip, the young
ster flattened out the last few yards on
his mount like a frog on a hot griddle,
while Phelan, astride Coffey's mare,, gain
ed the verdict by the narrowest of mar
gins. The winner carried ninety-six
pounds and laid so far out of it during
the early stages of the running that a
dollar Invested on her chances looked like
a dollar donated to charity. David Tenny
had many friends, but found the pace a
trifle warm, still he managed to finish a
close third.
Favorites were out on dress parade, tak
ing all but two numbers. Bullman con
tinues riding In superb form, again carry
ing away the saddle honors by putting
three winners over the plate.
â¢ Tim Toolln, an unknown quantity, work
ed the defeat of Vioris, favorite for the
opening six furlong scramble. The
"stranger" raced out in the lead with the
choice and when it came to the pinch,
Piggott brought Pongo, a 6 to 1 shot, up,
beating Sam Parker's mare a length in
1:14U- Toolin stayed long enough to get
the show.
Bullman added to his points in the
jockey contest by taking the seven fur
long selling run with Pat Morrissey. The
Burns & Waterhouse entry was held at
prohibitive odds in the books, and after
shaking off Croker, won easily from Mon
tanus. Owyhee performed poorly, never
showing much speed.
Tips on starters in the third event, a
five furlong sprint, were flying thick and
fast, TomaTe, St. Anthony, Harry Thatch
er. Almendral and Matt Hogan all being
touted as possible winner. Harry
Thatcher beat the barrier, but was out
footed the last part by both Almendral
and Bagdad, the trio finishing heads on
the post. Bagdad, which took the place,
was a 100 to 1 shot in the ring.
The Schorr colt F. W. Brode spread
eagled his field in the dash over the Fu
turity course. Four to five was laid about
him in the ring, and he won with Bull
man taking him up at the end. Alice
Dougherty came along from the rear,
leading Bee Bee out for the place.
"Iceman" Spencer landed the closing
mile run with Del Paso 11. The Darebin
horse closed a pronounced choice, coming
from behind and downing Tirade with ap
parent ease. Schreiber's Stuttgart led
Yaruba over the line more than half a
dozen lengths for third money.
Track Notes.
The eale of J. Naglee Burk's horses
will take place In the paddock at Oak

Frank' Eckert, the well-known book
maker, was a new face at the track
yesterday. Mr. Eckert looks hale and
hearty after his country sojourn, and re
ceived, a hearty welcome from his many
friends, both Eastern and Western.

LOTTEEY DKAWINQ.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 1900. L
ON HIS WAY TO
SECURE PEACE
WHEN ARRESTED
Story of a Hop Sing
: Highbinder.
SETTLEMENT NOT EFFECTED
MTJRDEB RfnHrp.-nnT.-p.-n TO OCCUR
IN THEATER.
Arrest of the Wives of Tong Men
' Said to Block All Attempts
at Pacific Nego
tiation.
Every possible effort to settle tho
trouble now existing between the Hop
Sing Tong and the Suey Sing Tong was
made yesterday. Meetings of tongmen
were held in this city, Oakland and
Marysvllle, but at the conclusion of each
the clarions of war sounded as loudly as
on the day hostilities commenced.
The Hop Sing Tong refuses to come to
terms and its members still thirst for
blood, that the killing of their fellow
members may be avenged. The arrest of
women, most of whom prove to be wives
of prominent Hop Sing men, has angered
the tong, and this is given as one reason
why the highbinders have decided to per
sist In defying the mandates of the police.
Another event which served to block
any attempt at securing the signature of
the Hop Sing president to the peace proc
lamation was the arrest of Ng Dong, In
vestigator of membership for that organ
ization. The Hop Sings claim that when
Dong was arrested Tuesday afternoon he
was on his way out of the city to meet
Wong Shi Shu, president of his tong, and
Induce him to arrange for a settlement.
Dong was placed In the "tanks," and In
his room at 20 Ross alley were found doc
uments which prove him to be a high
binder. This latter fact he does not dis
pute, but he claims that when arrested
he was on an errand of peace, which was
authorized by the Chinese Consul. It 1?
said that the Consul will make an effort
to secure his release.

Hall of Justice Report.
The Supervisors* Building Committee
yesterday considered the petition of the
North Central Improvement Club to take
steps to hasten the occupancy of the Hall
of Justice. Architect Shea was directed
to file a report immediately regarding the
condition of the building and to state
when it would be ready for use.
The resolution passed by the old board
authorizing the payment of $4237 to the
San Francisco Novelty and Plating
Works for work done on the Hall of
Justice was recommended for indefinite
postponement because of the orUnion of
the City Attorney that the boara has no
right to take fln.il action on resolutions
passed to print by the retiring board.
THIS CITY'S TEA
TRADE MENACED
BY FALSE TESTS
New York Experts Are
Discriminating.
When Tea Examiner Cornslius Toohey
and Charles B. Platt, tea expert, file their
report with the Secretary of the Treasury
next week there will be a great commo
tion in mercantile circles.
The gentlemen named are engaged In
examining samples of tea admitted at the
port of New York by the United States
tea expert at that place as being up to
the Government standard and entitled to
admission. It is understood that the re
sult of their Investigations thus far has
been the discovery that certain brands
passed upon by the New York expert as
up with the requirements of the Govern
ment standard are far short of the mark
In quality and only equal to tea that has
been rejected at this port.
Sixty per cent of all the tea Imported In
to the United States enters through the
port of New York. . If It Is admitted at
that port of an Inferior grade to that ad
mitted at San Francisco the inevitable re
sult will be that the remaining 40 per cent
of this trade will go to New York also.
The merchants of this city Interested in
this traffic have taken steps to prevent
this calamity. .In order that the non-tech
nical part of the public may understand
the case a historical reminiscence is nec
essary.
Up to a few years ago tea was admitted
to this country without reference to qual
ity and duty tree. Then a tax of 10 cents
a pound was levied, irrespective of qual
ity, but under the regulation that all of
the commodity falling to reach a certain
standard should be denied admission and
should be destroyed or sent out of the
country. Tea examiners were appointed
under civil service regulations at San
Kranclsco, Tacoma, Seattle, New York
and others ports of entry.
After the new regulation had been in
effect a few months it was found that tea
of a quality inferior to that prescribed by
the Government, standard was being ad
mitted at Tacoma and Seattle, while tea
Just as good was refused at San Fran
cisco. Home importers protested loudly
against this discrimination threatening an
important element of the commerce of
California, and sent their protest to
Washington. They advised that a disin
terested person should be appointed by
the Secretary of the Treasury to examine
and pass upon all samples submitted from
ports of entry in the United States, so
that uniformity might be assured and im
proper discrimination avoided.
Among the requests submitted to the
Secretary of the Treasury was one from
the expert at New York volunteering to
examine all samples sent from other
ports. He was thereupon authorized to
do so' This arrangement was deemed to
be one-sided and in favor of the Eastern ;
seaport, and a cry of disapproval went
up from San Francisco. If New York
was to pass upon San Francisco's Oolong
and English Breakfast why should not
San Francisco pass upon New York s im
portation of the same goods?
The protest seemed reasonable to the
department and the tea officials at this
port were vested with the power to ex
amine and pass upon the goods admitted
to the Eastern port. The examination
of the first batch of Eastern samples is
nearly completed and enough has been
found to show that the Eastern tea ex
pert was more lenient toward the East
than toward the West.
The discovery has created somewhat of
a sensation In commercial circles here
and when the report in all its fullness is
made public the wires between this city
and Washington will be hot for a while.
Tea Expert Platt and Examiner Toohey
declined yesterday to say anything for
publication with regard to the matter,
explaining their reticence by saying that
their work was not yet completed and
that their first report would be made to
the Treasury Department-
Duplicates of the tea samples sent from
New York to the expert and the examiner
here were forwarded to certain business
men in this city who caused examinations
to be made with the result, as already
stated that tea that would not be accept
Â°d at this port Is admitted at New York.
FIRi>T AWAY FOR CAPE NOME.
Captain Cogan of the bark Alaska expects to get away from here the first
week in April, or about six weeks ahead of the regular fleet. The Alaska will
take a full cargo for Nome, and after discharging it will probably go on a
whaling cruise. Captain Lew Williams will accompany Captain Cogan on the
Alaska. As whalemen they make a team hard to beat, and what they do not
know about the frozen north is not worth learning. Captain Cogan says the
Alaska will make Cape York, 100 miles north of Cape Nome, at least a fort*
night before the Ice will have left the latter place. He will then be able to
make his way down the coast as the ice breaks up and expects to reach the gold
fields a fortnight ahead of anything afloat.

San Francisco's Attractions Too Much
for the Assistant Army Surgeon.
The contract of Acting Assistant Army
Surgeon Frank J. O'Hare has been fen
nulled, and Dr. O'Hara has been ordered
to return to his home In New York. He

pending his transportation to the Philip
pines. He reported at department head
quarters and then proceeded to celebrate
his arrival in San Francisco. Then hÂ»
went in search of the general hospital at
the Presidio, but being unable to find it
he finally landed at the post headquarters
and reported to Major Cowles, who was
then in command. Major Cowles could
not receive the report, so he sent the doc
tor over to the general hospital In charge
of the headquarters orderly.
The doctor did not remain long at the
hospital, however, but proceeded down
town again and picked up the ends of the
celebration with such success that he for
got about his experience with Major
Cowles, and started out again to find
some one to report to. He lost track of
the hospital a second time and once more
he wound up at post headquarters, where
a second time he gravely proceeded to
report for duty to Major Cowles. Once
was bad, but twice was not bearable, so
after again sending the surgeon to the
general hospital in charge of the orderly.
Major Cowles reported the matter to
headquarters, and the result was the im
mediate annullment of the doctor's con
tract.

Notable Deaths
of the Day.
DEATH OF AN ARGONAUT
WHO WAS A MILLIONAIRE
Francis S. Wensinger, a pioneer of 1849
and a man who has been Identified with
the commercial progress of this city from
Its very Infancy, died In his apartments
at the Occidental Hotel at 8:30 o'clock
yesterday morning. Deceased had been,
sick for pome time past, but the direct
cause of his death was paralysis of the
heart, superinduced by rheumatism, from
which disease he had been a sufferer for
a long time.
Mr. Wensinger was a very wealthy man,
his fortune being estimated at from one
million upward. As far back as the early
fifties good luck came to him. He com
menced amassing money then, and every
thing he touched from that time to the
day of his death turned out well and paid
him a golden return for the energy and
business acumen he put Into it. He was
for a long time one of the heaviest stock
holders in the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, but eventually sold out his in
terests to Goodall & Perkins.
Mr. Wensinger was also one of the
founders of "the First National Bank of
this city and a director in numerous other
large business concerns. He owns many
valuable pieces of city real estate, and
was silent partner In the real estate firm
of J. J. O'Farrell & Co. O'Farrell was
his nephew, and repaid his uncle's kind
ness in setting him up in business by
skipping out of the city with all the
money ne could lay his hands on. Mr.
Wensinger settled all of his nephew's
shortages dollar for dollar.
The dead man was one of the leading
Catholics of the city and enjoyed the full
contldence of the prelates and priests of
that church. He was very devout and
charitable, and the different Catholic
churches of this city are indebted to him
for many generous gifts.
Deceased was about 75 years of age. He
left a widow, but no children. As yet no
arrangements have been made for the
funeral, but in all likelihood it -will take
place from one of the prominent Catholic
churches of the city.
Mr. Wensinger's home was at Freestone
Sonoma County, where he had a magnifi
cent country place, which was his pride.
Attached to the place was a dairy, the
perfecting of which was the hobby of the
dead millionaire and which he succeeded
in making the finest institution of its kind
in the State. About a month ago he came
down to the city, accompanied by his wife.
They took apartments at the Occidental,
where Mr. Wenslnger was stricken with
the illness which resulted in. his death.

at the battle of Vlgan about two months

PEKING ARRIVES
WITH BODIES OF
DEAD SOLDIERS
First of Melancholy
Procession.
SIX TRANSPORTS EN ROUTE
â¢
SAD BEMINDEHS OF WAB IN
PHILIPPINES.
The transport City of Peking, which ar
rived yesterday with 156 soldier dead, was
the first of a melancholy procession that
!s now crossing the ocean. It represents
ihe other side of the war and is made up
of the dead, the wounded, the diseased
and the insax.e of the Philippine army of
occupation.
The Peking left Manila on December 29
tnd made the trip to this city In twenty
seven days, stopping only two days at
Nagasaki. In addition to the bodies of
the soldiers who died in the Philippines
6he brings the remains of Commander
Carlin. U. S. X.. who died of peritonitis
two days out from Manila.
It had been reported that many of the
dead soldiers on the Peking had suc
cumbed to smaHlpox and other conta
gious diseases, ar.d it was feared that
permission to land them would be refused
oy the local he.Uth officials. The report
however, proved to be unfounded. Dr
Klnyoun, the Federal quarantine officer,
after an <>xamii:ation of the death certi
ficates and the f-hip's papers, certified to
Health Officer O'Brien that none of the
dead wore victims of contagious diseases,
and Dr. O'Brieu at once issued a genera'
permit to Cclonoi Long- of the quarter
master's der'arimpr.t to land the bodies
at the Presidio. Special permits in each
case mi;?; be floured before the bodies
can be shipped East.
The Peking *as released from quaran
tine by Dr. KJnyoun late yesterday af
terr.con, but remained at anchor off
Meipgs Whaif during the night. The
bodies, which are in hermetically sealed
caskets, will ho taken off this morning
and the traifport docked, unless con
trary orders are issued to-day by Dr.
Kinyoun. a rfmote contingency, in view
of the fact that there is no sickness
aboard.
ThÂ»re were thirty cabin passengers ar.d
375 frtcerap-e passengers en the transport.
The latter w?re mostly invalided soldiers
and the forrier chiefly army ar.d naval

INCOMING SHIPS
SIGHT WRECKAGE
OFF THE COAST
Some Vessel Has Lost
Her Deckload.
DEEPWATER CRAFT ARRIVE
?
INVERSBTAID MAKES VALPA
RAISO IN DISTRESS.
Another fleet of coasters and deep
water ships made port yesterday. Two
of them report passing .wreckage, and
shipping men are wondering if any of the
locally owned vessels has met with dis
aster. On January 13, when about 1300
miles east of the Japanese coast, the
transport City of Peking passed what
looked like the mainmast of a fore and
aft schooner. This was in latitude 33 43
north, longitude 165 4S east, at 5:20 p. m.
The wreckage was new, and as It was
blowing hard at the time some vessel
bound this way has evidently met with a
mishap.
On January 22, when about thirty miles
west-southwest of the Farallones, the
British ship Samoena passed what looked
like the deckload of a lumber vessel and
a considerable quantity of wreckage. Sev
eral of the lumber fleet are making long
trips from the Sound, and it may be one
of them that has met with a mishap.
Among the fleet that got in yesterday
were the British ships Merioneth, Sa
moena and Cromdale and the transport
City of Peking. The Merioneth was 132
days from Swansea, the Samoena 133 days
from Antwerp and the Cromdale '147 days
from Liverpool. This about clears up tne
list of vessels about due, so the pilots
will have a rest for a week or so. Owing
to the heavy weather that has prevailed
for the past fortnight all of them have
had a particularly trying time of it, so
the prospect of a calm alter the rush is
hailed with delight.
The British bark Invcrsnaid, which left
here on November 11 last with 52,757 cent
als of wheat, valued at $54,100, is playing
in hard luck. A dispatch to the Mer
chants' Exchange yesterday states that
sh3 has put into Valparaiso with her cargo
shifted, bulwarks stove and decks dam
aged. Captain Ross and his officers are
well known in San Francisco, and their
friends will be sorry to hear of the mis
hap to the ship.
Ihe overdue British ship Reliance has
been heard from again. On January 21, in
latitude 36 06 north, longitude 133 24 west,
she was spoken, and Captain Robinson
signaled "All well."
The Harbor Commissioners held their
usual weekly meeting yesterday. The
Fire Commissioners sent a communication
stating that there were not enough fresh
water ttre plugs on the front. It was
pointed out that it was impossible to
reach the end of many of the wharves,
and the city's apparatus was endangered
by having to go under the sheds. The
fire at section 1 of the seawall was quoted
as an Instance in point. The matter was
referred to the chief engineer, and the
extra fire plugs will be put in as speedily
as possible.
George A. Knight, on behalf of the
State Board of Health, wrote the com
mission offering it the State quarantine
tug Governor Perkins. Since the Federal
authorities have assumed control of quar
antine matters there is no more use for
a State quarantine launch and for several
months there has been nothing for the
Governor Perkins to do. Captain Brown,
superintendent of the State tugs and
dredgers, and Captain McGowan of the
quarantine launch, will hold a conference
and If the boat can be used on the front
the Harbor Commissioners will accept
her.
G. Francoeur was appointed "Wharfinger
at Washington street wharf, vice R. Staf
ford, time expired. Mr. Stafford has made
a most careful and conscientious Wharf
inger and the patrons of the wharf will
be sorry to hear of his removal.
The buckets on two of the dredgers re
quire repairing and bids were called for
the work. P. F. Dundon offered to do the
Job for $540 and secured the contract. The
Golden State and Miners' Iron Works
asked $996 on the same specifications.
The officers and men of the State fire
tug took possession of their new quarters
yesterday. Owing to the changes in the
approaches to the ferry slips the old
building has to bo removed, so new quar
ters were provided for Captain Brown and
his men over the Harbor Commissioners'
store. There is a commodious sleeping
room for the men on watch and a loung
lng-room that has no equal on the front.
Captain Brown, superintendent of the
tugs and dredgers, has a splendid room
which commands a view of East street
north and south. Mission street and al
most the entire bay. The old building,
which the fire boat men have vacated, will
be erected at the Folsom street landing
as a boathouse for Henry Peterson. At
that point it will be of the greatest bene
fit to the general public, as Peterson's
present quarters are always overtaxed by
people awaiting the coming and going of
the men-of-war and revenue cutter
launches and boats from the transports
and other vessels In the stream.
The mall steamer China sailed yester
day for the Orient. She took away a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 1900.
PIONEER GIBBS
ALONE SURVIVES
A DEVOUT BAND
Episcopal Celebration
of First Service.
TRIBUTE TO THE ARGONAUTS
a
HYMNS STJNG THAT WEEE STJNG
FIFTY YEARS AGO.
The second day's session of the Epis
copal Convention at Trinity Church
opened yesterday with a service com
memorative of the fiftieth anniversary* of
the first Episcopal service on the Pa
cific Coast. The chancel of the sacred
edifice was decorated tastefully with
pine boughs, symbolic of the virgin wil
derness in which half a century ago the
little band of churchmen gathered to
worship the Christ whose gospel tidings
they carried to the pioneers. The choir
sang "From Greenland's Icy Mountains"
and "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah,"
two hymns sung at that first historic
gathering. In addition an offertory solo
was rendered by Mrs. J. E. Bermingham.
In Introducing Cornelius V. S. Gibbs,
who delivered an address dealing main
ly with these early scenes. Bishop Nich
ols paid an eloquent tribute to the pa
triarch of the church in the following
words:
"With love and reverence we turn to
day to him who. of all those present, is
able to raise his voice even as he did at
that service fifty years ago. It gives
me great pleasure to Introduce to you
a pioneer whose signature is appended
to the first document of this church, one
who can truly say, 'In it I have had a
large share' â C. V. S. Gibbs."
Mr. Gibbs' address was largely a re
sume of the work of the Episcopal church
in California in the early days and a de
scription of the country in which the lit
tle bands of earnest workers found them
selves scattered. He told of the estab
lishment of Trinity Church in a little
wooden shed and of the n'rst Thanksgiv
ing and Christmas services held by the
few of whom he now is tb,e sole survivor.
Mr. Gibbs protested against the prevail
ing opinion that the forty-niners were a
horde of rough adventurers, and depre
cated the statement of a belief which he
had once heard pronounced from the pul
pit of a church in this city, "that it would
be well when the last pioneer was in his
coffin." In language trembling with emo
tion, the venerable speaker declared that
whether search should be made in the
annals of Yerba Buena or of the foot
hills, where glistened the golden nuggets
in the streams, one could not fail to find
abundant and incontrovertible evidence
that religious worship was a pronounced
feature of social life.
The afternoon session of the convention
was largely taken up with a discussion
of the salary of the archdeacon and the
election of officers. After lengthy con
sideration of the salary problem. It was
decided by a large majority that the
archdeacon be paid $1500 annually, which
sum should be set aside by the board
of missions, and be met by voluntary con
tribution. The following were selected to
serve for the ensuing year:
Delegates to missionary council*â Clerical
member. Rev. John A. Emery; lay member.
Colonel J. V. D. Mlddleton; registrar. Rev.
Standing committee: Clerical membersâ Rev.
J. Bake well, D.D.. Rev. R. C. Foute. Rev. W,
I. Kip Jr.. Rev. E. J. Lton. Rev. William M.
Rellly. Rev. Robert Ritchie. A mistake in
the count of the ballots cast for lay members
caused their election to be postponed until to
day.
Board of directors â Walter E. Dean, A. N.
Drown, Rev. D. O. Kelley. Rlpht Rev. W. F.
N'lchols. D.D., A. H. Fhelps. W. A. M. Van

Board of missions: Clerical members â Rev.
D. C. Garrett. Rev. T. J. Lacey, Ph. D., Rev.
G. E. Swan. Lay members â Dr. H. C. DaviÂ».
G. H. Kellogg, Colonel J. V. D. Mlddleton,
Vincent JJeale.
Professor J. O. Lincoln of the Episcopal
Church Divinity School at San Mateo
stated that the Institution was steadily
progressing and asked his brethren to
make necessary contributions of books.
By unanimous vote It Â¦was decided to have
Bishop Nichols' sermon of Tuesday print
ed for distribution on account of its his
torical value. A. N. Drown was reap
pointed chancellor of the diocese by the
Bishop and thanked for his labors in the
past.
Bishop Nichols was empowered to ap
point a committee to make necessary ar
rangements for the appointment of com
mittees to handle intelligently arrange
ments for the big convention to be held
in October, 1901, three members of which
will be the Bishops of San Franclscp. Los
Aneeles and Sacramento. It was decided
to hold the next annual convention in
Grace Episcopal Church, after which an
adjournment was taken to 9:30 o'clock
this morning 1 .
In the evening the visiting delegates
were tendered a reception by Bishop and
Mrs. Nichols at the Occidental Hotel. The
parlors had been beautifully decorated
and a string orchestra lent the soft
charms of sweet music to the occasion.
Among the guests were to be seen near
ly every prominent Episcopal divine In the
State and while there were any number of
the cloth present to do honor to their
superior, the laity was well represented
by more than 100 of California's most
prominent men and most beautiful wo

Santa Clara Xews.
Mayor Phelan's catering- to the Exam
iner â his attempt to foist Esola upon the
people of San Francisco is not compatible
with his past record. It is'in pronounced
discord to his past actions, and varies
widely from the other appointments
that he has made within the last month.
Glancing over the list of appointees who
will direct the administration of govern
ment in San Francisco we see, in the
main, good men â citizens whose probity
and honor do not have to be made ap
parent by tribunalâ and their worthi
ness is conceded by a people that accepts
them. These men are not "goods" deliv
ered in accordance with previously made
newspaper contracts, but able citizens se
lected from both partiesâ appointed be
cause of their fitness.' In the case of
Esola there seems to be no doubt that
the appointment was dictated by another
than the Mayor. Mr.. .Phelan's standard
of taste proves this to be a truth. The

easily corrupted Supervisors. It is natural he. should turn to Burns, for Burns has been
a known defaulter in even* office he ever held except that of Police Commissioner, and
there his record is not known. Such a "Democrat" and such a "Republican" have a wide
ground for mutual understanding, but there is no portion of that ground they dare dis
close to the people; and therefore the need of secret conspiracy in planning and a swift
ness of action in carrying out the plans.
There is little time left for Republican protest, but every day and hour of that

â¢ yet baftle and defeat the scheme, if it prompt to resolute action.
The voice of the rank and file of the party must make itself heard. Every Repub-.

i State in this issue. By protests against the bosses, by memorials settmg forth the right,
I by letter and by word of mouth, the genuine Republicans of the State should assert them

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â Frank A.

tend the annual convention of engineers.
He Is at the Willard. Dr. F. T. McLean
of Alameda is in Washington.
THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM PROJECT.
I j ROM the tone of the discussion at the confer
ence held on Tuesday evening it is evident that
among the business men of San Francisco there
ire trmny who believe the establishment of a com
mercial museum in this city to be a feasible enterprise
md are willing to devote no small part of their time,
alent, energies and wealth to its attainment. The
irst step in the movement was taken by the organiza
ion of a promotion committee, with President
A'hecler of the State University at its head, and by
iroyiding for a subcommittee to investigate the whole
Ã¼bject and make a report upon ways and means at a
neeting to be called later on.
That the work is to be one of great magnitude W3S
made clear at the start. "We must conceive of the
museum as a great thing," said Mr. Wheeler, "for if
we conceive it small we shall conceive it wrong." It
is one of the enterprises which cannot be carried out
by individual enterprise, nor by a single interest or
industry of the community. To achieve it there must
be union of all the forces at our command. It there
fore furnishes a test of the degree to which our people
are capable of sinking the individual struggle for su
premacy and subordinating it to a co-operative effort
for the general good.
The very fact that a body of men of such influence
and leadership in the city has entered upon a serious
consideration of a project so vast and far-reaching
may be taken as 1 a proof that a new spirit of enter
prise has been awakened in the community. It is a
spirit that is in accord with the time. It is an out
come of an intelligent recognition of the wonderful
opportunities that recent developments in the Orient
have opened for us, and a determination to profit by
them.
The inducements are certainly strong enough to
arouse the emulation of all. The trade of the Pacific
Ocean countries is not only of vast magnitude, but is
rapidly expanding. It amounts in its entirety to more
than $2,140,000,000 annually, but of that sum the
United States has at present less than,? per cent. The
British Islands, far away in the remote northern
seas on the other side of the globe, have by sheer
energy obtained upward of one-half of the whole,
and now Germany, by intelligent direction and a
careful study of trade conditions, is pushing her way
forward to rival the British. The people of the
United States have in the competition of such rivals
the highest incentives to action. We must have the
commercial enterprise of the British and apply it
with the scientific skill of the Germans. If that be
done the bulk of thi* immense Pacific Ocean trade
will come to the United States and pass into the
country through the Golden Gate, to the enrichment
o ( every class in the community. , .
It is fortunate that the movement has the leader
ship of such a man as President Wheeler. As The
Call has already pointed out, that leadership lifts the
enterprise above suspicion of being a movement for
the advantage of special interests and gives it a na
tional prestige. The outlook is therefore promising.
The cost of the museum will be great, but not greater
than, we can afford, and, moreover, we have a just
right to expect aid from the Federal Government in
establishing and in maintaining it. Definite plans
and estimates will probably be submitted at the next
meeting of the committee, and in the meantime the
public may prepare itself for the enterprise. It is
bound to be undertaken, and when started every one
in proportion to his means and influence will be ex
pected to support it as a movement of national as
well as civic patriotism. '
OUR SPRING STUDIES.
AFTER a career of marked success, in which
public favor has been fully won and retained,
the Home Study Circle of The Call is about
to complete the fall and winter course. It is therefore
timely to announce that with the issue of Monday,
February 15, the spring series of studies will begin,
and will present to the readers and students new fields
of interest and instruction.
The spring course has been devised to fit the time
and the season. This being the year of a Presiden
tial election, a series of studies will be given on
American Political Parties; as the Paris Exposition
will attract many visitors from this country and,
moreover, lead to the use of a large number of French
terms and phrases in reports of news from the great
fair, there will be a timely interest in the Twenty Les
sons in French Conversation which will be given in
the course; the outing season comes with the spring,
and accordingly the host of those who delight in
photography as a holiday amusement will be pleased
and instructed by the papers on Photography for
Amateurs; all classes will be gratified by the striking
course of articles on Recent Scientific Discoveries,
and there will.be hardly less interest in the series of
papers on Golden Ages of Literature and that con
taining Biographical Studies for girls.
The studies of American politics will begin with
an account of the Federalist party and its opponents
in the early days of the republic, and will be brought
down to the campaign of iB6O, closing with a de
scription of the fully organized political machine o:
our time. The scientific papers will include articles
on Wireless Telegraphy, High Speed Telegraph Sys
tems, Photography in Colors, Liquid Air, Dark
Lightning, Moving Pictures, Process Engraving,
Submarine Boats, the New Gases.
The studies on the Golden Age of Literature will
cover literary history from the time of Zoroaster and
the sacred literature of Persia down to the present
time, and will close with papers on Tennyson and
Browning and the golden age of American literature.
Among the biographical studies for girls will be
sketches of eminent women of all ranks and of nearly
al! ages, including such diverse types as Joan of Arc,
Mrs. Siddons, Harriet Martineau, Rosa Bonheur and
Florence Nightingale.
The contributors to the series will include sr.ch
eminent writers and educators as Edward Everett
Hale, D.D., Boston: Jesse Macy, LL. D., lowa Col
lege; Paul ..Elmer; Moore, Harvard University;
Thomas Marc Parrott, Ph. D., Princeton University;
Charles Forster Smith, Ph. D., University of Wiscon
sin; Isaac N. Demmon, A. M., LL. D., University
oi Michigan; Arthur Hi Palmer, M. "A., Yale Univer
sity; Maurice Francis Egan, LL. D., Catholic Uni
versity of America; Charles Horswell, Ph. D., North
western University; Miss Vida D. Scudder, Wellesley
College; Charlotte Brewster Jordan, Philadelphia;
John Leverett Moore, Ph. D., Vassar College;
Joseph Villiers Denney, A. M., Ohio State Univer
sity; L. A. Sherman, University of Nebraska; Charles
W. Benton, .M. A., Litt. D., University of Minnesota;
William J. Hopkins, S. 8.. Drexel Institute; Pro
fessor Benno Kirschbaum, Philadelphia; George W.
Gilson, Buffalo, N. Y.
From this prospectus ft will be seen that in many
respects the spring course will be even superior to
that which is about to close. At any rate it will be
fully equal to the demands of the wide diversity of
readers which American culture has developed.

AN EXTRA SESSION CONSPIRACY.
LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE.
GOVERNOR GAGE has called an extra session of the Legislature under circum
stances and upon terms fitted to arouse the indignation of the State. The sum
mons issued on Tuesday for a session to meet on Monday gives but six days'
notice to the public and to the legislators. , That fact in itself is suspicious and suggests
that some plot has been prepared which can be carried to success only by being sprung
as a surprise and hurried to a swift conclusion before the people have time to oppose or
even to denounce it.
Such suspicions are well founded. The Call has evidence that Governor Gage
came to this city and had a secret conference with three men, at which time the pro
gramme for the session was arranged and agreed upon. The three persons whom the chief
executive of the State called into council on the subject were W. F. Herrin of the law de
partment of the Southern Pacific Railroad; J. B. Wright, division superintendent of the

Southern Pacific road, and Daniel M. Burns. Those are the men who' determined that
the session should begin on the sixth day after the call, and they decided, further, that the
balloting for Senator shall begin on next Tuesday, the day after the session begins.
A meeting of that kind for that purpose may be rightly termed a conspiracy. The
Republicans of the State have to confront the issue it raises. Herrin is a Democrat,
Wright is a Democrat. Neither of these men has any regard for the interests of the Repub
lican party. Burns has no interest in it other than the i office he hopes to gain from it
through the Governor and the Southern Pacific Railroad. It is with these two railroad
Democrats that the Governor has bargained away the Senatorship to Burns or to some
one like him, if it be found that his election is impossible. .
The issue, however, rises above partisan considerations. It is not Republicans
only whose indignation will be aroused by it. In a broad sense it concerns every citizen
of California.^Here is a railroad corporation, through two of its agents, conniving with the
Governor of the State to take snap judgment on the Legislature and elect its candidate
to the Senate regardless of the popular will. There is in that fact a wrong, an insult
and a menace to every citizen, no matter what his party may .be.
Herrin, who has been the arch plotter in the conspiracy to elect Burns to the
Senate, attained his eminence in the Southern Pacific Company by methods better known
to members of former Boards of Supervisors than to the general public. He would like
to have in the United States Senate a man whom he could use as he was wont to use the

XI. RICHARD 111.
Noteâ The first installment of Dr. Par
rott's paper was published on Monday
last.
The Fall of Richard.
Richard's fal! H not brought about by
external agencies. Like his rise to power,
it Is due to his own inner self. So long
as the goal lay before his eyes he was
master of himself and all his faculties.
The crown once attained, his passion is
sated and a decay of his powers set? in
that hurries him to his doom. His head
long energy of mind gives way. he loses
his self-command and power of dissimu
lation; he Is no longer the deceiver, but
the deceived. And this inner change
takes place at the very moment that he
has reached the goal and steps beyond
it to tho perpetration of his blackest
crime â the murder of his innocent
nephews. When he discloses his purpose
to Buckingham and that hitherto willing
accomplice of his villainy falters, Rich
ard cannot conceal his anger. He at once
Insults his strongest supporter and lets
him ge untouched to head a rebellion.
This Is not the Richard who at the first
sign of opposition swept Hastings to the
block. Later en, although he suspects
Stanley of being secretly in league with
Richmond, and openly charges him with
treachery, he actually sends the suspect
to levy forces to repel the invasionâ the
very forces that at Bosworth turned the
tide of victory for Richmond.
The fourth scene of the fourth act
seems especially designed to show the de
cay of Richards powers. Externally It is
an almost perfect parallel to the wooing
of Anne. Jlut a careful comparison of
the two scenes convinces us that we. have
here not a repetition, hut a contrast. In
the first we can soe Anne yioldinj; step
by step; In the second Elizabeth is un
moved to the very end and meets all
Richard's pleas with the simple answer.
"You slew my children." Only when he
stoops to a scarcely veiled threat against
the life of the Princess does she give way.
But in the very next scene we find he*
pledging her daughter's hand to Richard's
juxirs rmrTrs booth as rh-hard in
rival. And even if the poet had not given I
us this plain hintâ which, by the way,
Colley Cibber turned into a stage aside
at the end of the wooing seene â it is quiU: j
incredible that at this staKv of the drama j
Shakespeare would have presented to us
in a weaker form a repetition of the woo
ing of Anne. It is the peripetia of the
play. Richard is marching to his doom,
his old powers of mastery and insight
into the mind are lost, and Elizabeth's |
feigned yielding deceives him as he had r
once deceived co many others. '
Richard Is a born soldier; in the so!iln
quy that opens the play we seem to hear
the very god of war breathing forth con
tempt for the weak piping time of peace.
But on the eve of his last battle Rich
ard's soul is overshadowed by gloomy
forebodings.
I have not that alacrity cf spirit.
Nor cheÂ«r nf mind, that I was wont to have.
His last sleep on earth is broken by
visions of his murdered victims. WÂ« may
pass over the apparition of the ghosts, a
scene bo crude and archaic that here. If
anywhere, we might suspect the presence
of a less skillful hand than ShakPa
peare's.^But in the soliloquy that follow*,
the poePdisplays his full power. Here we
see most clearly the utter ruin of tho old
self-mastery of Richard. He starts from
a dream of death "in the lost battle, i
borne down by the flying," and turns sav
agely upon himself:
0 coward conscience, how thou didst affright
me."
In the period of his success it was Rich
ard's mastery of his conscience that hal {
made him so irresistible, but now he i:- a [
houfe divided r.painst himself, and while
there is no word of penitence there Is a
fearful recognition of his lonely state.
1 shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I liie, no soul shall pity me.
Even In himself he finds no pity, and tho
ghostly voices of his .victims ringing in
his ears from the realm of sleep foretell
his doom. Yet Richard is not doomed be
cause Â»he has such dreams; rather he
dreams thus because he Is already |
doomed.
Only when the trumpets blow the onser
does the old heroic spirit of him who was !
once the champion of the house of York [
awake. His self-confidence returns and
he charges with the cry of victory upoa
his Hps. In the battle he enacts more i
wonders than a man. and when he is over
powered by numbers he falls with the I
battered emblem of royalty about his
temples. Even in death he holds the
crown: [
A Dream of Historic Nemesis.
"Richard III." as we have shown. !Â«
the drama of a single character dominat
ed by a single, master passion. But it is
something more than this. It is the
drama of Nemesis in history. Evil us
Richard is. he is the instrument of divine
wrath the scourge of God upon a su'lty
generation. With but one exception, Rich
ard's Â¦ victims are guilty souls, and evr n
the princes pay the penalty of their fath
er's sin Queen Margaret, whose appear- ;
ance at the courts of Edward and Rich- I
ard is of course utterly unhistorical, is !
the embodiment and mouthpiece of this I
spirit of Nemesis. She appears in but two
S c ene sâ in the first to invoke a curse upon
the guilty house of York and its sup-
Dorters- in the second to triumph in tUe
complete fulfillment of her nrayer for
vengeance. Her words to the Duchess of j
York sum up the historic moral of the i
play:
Bear with me; I am hungry tor revenge.
And now I cloy me r.-ith beholJlnff it.
Never had England fallen so low as
during the Wars of the Roses. Simple j
bloodshed and deceit were the slightest
of men's crimes. A shock was needed
to clean the air, and Richard, the incar
nation of the sins of his age. came like a
thunder-storm upon an atmosphere over
charged with guilt. But when his violence I
was passed the Judgment of God was ac- j
complished and a better day dawned for I
England.- In the marriage of Richard and j
Elizabeth the houses of York and Lan- J
caster were united, and during the reign i
of -their descendants England rose from |
the anarchy of civil war to the pitch of
pride she held in Shakespeare's day. And
we may well believe that the poet pouted
out his own heart in the fervent prayer
of Richmond, with which the play close*.
that GoJ would abate the edge of traitors
and enrich the time to come with smooth
faced peace.
The Text of -Richard III."
Into the vexed question of the text of
"Richard III" this is not the place to
enter, but so much may be stated, th*
play was first printed as a quarto In 1597.
and reappeared in this form five tlmea
before the -publication of the first folio.
All the quartos are based, with a few
slight changes, upon the first, which pre
sents a text much superior to that of the
usual . pirated editions of Shakespeare's
plays. But. on the other hand, the text
of this drama in the first folio varies so
widely from that of the quartos as to sug
gest that it was based upon a wholly dif
ferent manuscript. The question which of
these represents the authentic work of
Shakespeare has received varying an
s>w*rs. The Cambridge editors see the
hand -of an unknown reviser In both, but.
on the whole, prefer the quarto text. On
the other hand, the acute Shakespeare
scholar, SpeilrlinEr. came, after a most
careful examination of the problem, to
the conclusion that the folio text repre->
sented the result of Shakespeare's own
latest revision. Students wishing to pur
sue this matter further are referred to
Spedding's paper in the "Transactions of
the N?w Sh-ikfspeare Society" (1375-78). to
Pickergiirs reply to Spedding in the same
volume, to the Introduction to the p!ay In
tho Cambridge edition, and to Fleay's
"Life and Work of Shakespeare." The
introductions to the reprints of the quar
tos published by the New Shakespeaxs
Society .may alao be consulted.
Princeton T'nlversli
Dr. Drandcs' Estimate of "Richard
The Richard of the tragedy 13 deforrn
=d; he is undersized and crooked, has a
nump on nia DaCK
and a withered arm.
He is not. like so
many other hunch
backs, under any il
lusion as to his ap
pearance. He doe*
not think himself
handsome, nor ia he
loved by the daugh
ters of Eve, irf
whom deformity is
so apt to awaken
that instinct of pity
â¢which is akin to
love. No, Richard
feels himself mal
treated by nature;
from his birth up
ward he has suf
fered wrong at her
hands, and in apite
of his high and
strenuous spirit he
has grown up an
outcast. He has
from the first had to
do without hla
mother's love and to
listen to the gibes ot
his enemies. Men
have pointed at his
shadow and laughed.
Tiie dogs have bark
ed at him as ha
halted by. But in
this luckless frame
dwells an ambitious
soul. Other people's
paths to happiness
and enjoyment are
closed to him. But
he will rule; for that
he was born. Power
is everything to him
âhis fixed idea.
Power alone can
give him his revenge
upon the people
around him. whom
he hates or despises, or both. The glory
of the -diadem shall rest upon the nead
that crowns his misshapen body. He sees
its golden splendor afar off. Many lives
stand between him and his goal, but he
will shrink from no falsehood, no treach
ery, no bloodshed if only he can reach it.
Into this character Shakespeare trans
forms himself in imagination. It is the
mark of the dramatic poet to be always
able to get out of his own skin and into
another's.
Questions for Research and Re-riew.
1. Do the incidents of this play seem to
be presented for the sake of the plot, or
in order to exhibit an extraordinary char-
2. Ia Richard's character represented as
developing, or is it fixed when the play
opens? Does Richard's character, as
seen in this play, fulfill the delineation
given in the closing portion of "King
Henry VI." part 3?
3. What is the keynote of Richard's
character? What his chic' characteris
tic? Is it ambition, dissimulation, love
of wickedness for its own sake, artistic
villainy, executive ability misdirected? â¢
4. Has Richard any excuse, true or false,
for his crimes? Has he reason to hate
his victims? What is his supreme crime?
5. Humor is usually a sign of soul
henlth. How is it with Richard's humor?
What effect does his humor produce on
the reader?
6. Does Richard at any time show fear,
sensibility, conscience?
7. Does the wooing and winning of Lad-
Anne seem plausible or probable? Do you
find it revolting? What doe 9 Richard's
success in the wooing of Anne imply?
Granted that act I. scene 2, does help thÂ«
play. Is act IV. scene 4. necessary?
S. What supernatural element is there
in this play? What does this element add
to the force of the play? Did Shakespeare
believe in ghosts? *"'
9. Does anything come of Queen Mar
garet's curses? Supposing this curse
scene omitted, would the subsequent
course of the play have been different?
10. Does sufficient calamity overtake the
wrongdoers of the. play? Does Richard
pay full penalty?
11. Are all of the Instrumentalities by
which Richard's downfall Is brought
about good in themselves?
12. How does womanhood appear In this
play. How does motherhood appear?
13 Consider the minor charactersâ the
murderers, the Princesâ are they carefully
individualized?
14 Do you find any scenes of quiet and
relief from intense action?

Band of Mercy Badges.
More than 14.000 school children will be
made happy soon by the receipt of badge,
and certillcates showing that they are
members of the Bands of Mercy connected
with the San Francisco Society tor tho
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Sev
eral months ago the ladies of the organi
zation decided to form children Into bands
for the purpose of educating them to be
kind to all dumb beasts and they were
encouraged by the members of the Board
of Education to the extent that more than
14.0C0 little ones are now enrolled in tho
cause. Of course some credential was
necessary and the ladles gave an enter
tainment which netted sufficient to war
rant the purchase of 23.000 badges and
cards and these will be distribuated to
day.
Mizpah Club Officers.
The ilizpah Charity Club at a recent
meeting elected the following officers to
serve for the coming year: President.
Mrs. A. C. Rulofson: vice president. Mrs.
H. Newell; recording secretary, Mrs. R.
H. Countryman: corresponding secretary,
Mrs. E. M. Reading; treasurer, Mrs. J. J.
Spleker. All but Mrs. Reading were re
elections. The reports of the officers
showed the club to be In food financial
condition.
Commission Investigates
Messrs. McCarthy, Everett and Freud
of the Civil Service Commission, accom
panied by Chief Examiner Moran. made
the rounds of the County Clerk"s office
yesterday. The members of the commis
sion gained considerable information
from County Clerk Deane and his depu
ties, which "will- be again asked the depu
ties when they come up for examination
in the near future. As the business of thÂ»
County Clerk is very complicated, It Is
probable that several more visits will bo
made by the commission before the ex
amination day arrives.
ROGERS DEAD IN LAW.
His Widow Given Judgment on a
.!; ;K ;v Â¦; Policy on His Life.
A Jury In Judge Hunt's court yesterday
decided that Hiram Rogers, who myste
riously disappeared while on a voyage
from this city to Port Harford on the
steamer Santa Rosa, is legally dead, and
that the Manhattan Life Insurance Com
pany must pay his widow Maria T. Rog
ers, the sum of a policy held by the do
ceased,. $5000 and $108 30 interest thereon.
The Insurance company claimed that
Rogers van not dead, but in hiding, and
it resisted payment. Mrs. Rogers' proofs
established Rogers' death to the satis
faction of the Jury, however, and Judg
ment' was rendered accordingly.
WANTS SCOTT APPOINTED.
Friends of Tax Collector Petition the
Mayor to That End.
A petition has been prepared for presen
tation to Mayor Phelan by the friends of
Tax Collector Scott requesting that he be
appointed to the office to which he was
elected in the event of the Supreme Court
upholding the decision of Judge Seawell
declaring that Scotf3 election was iflesil
because he was not qualified under the
charter by a five years' residence in the
city. Several thousand names have pi
ready been secured to the petition, which
reads as followB:
Hon. James IX Phelan. Mayor of San
Franciscoâ Sir: Whereas, the voters of
this city, by a preponderating majority,
did at the last election express their con
fidence in, and preference for. Joseph H.
Scott for the ofilee of Tax Collector,' and
whereas the election of said Scott to said
office has been net aside in the Superior
Court on account of a purely -technical
inrllÃlblUty, and whereas" further, neither
Mr. Scott's ability. Integrity or competency
has at all been called into question, and
the InellÃiblllty complained of now exists
no longer; -"',' : r .'.'
Therefore we, the undersigned," electors
and taxpayers of San Francisco, respect
fully petition and unce you to appoint said
Scott to the office of Tax Collector, in com
pliance â¢ with the expressed wishes of tho
majority of our fellow citizens, to the end
that no further doubt may exist as to the
legality ' of hln tenure of office, and that
all litigation concerning the same may be
brought to an immediate termination.
PERSONATED AN OFFICER.
George Neustadt, a Dishonorably Dis
charged Marine, Arrested for
. Intimidating Women.
George Neustadt, a dishonorably dis
charged marine, appeared in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday on the charge of
personating an officer. He asked for a
continuance till to-day and it was
granted.
Neustadt has been wearing a bogus star
and representing himself as "detective
No. 2" to women, with the object, it is
supposed, of extorting money from them.
Tuesday he called upon Addle Reitz in the
Carlton House and told her that her
brother was going to send her a box of
poisoned candy. Ho took the girl to the
Larkin street corridor of the City Hall
and kept her there for two or three hours.
He returned to the Carlton House that
night and was chased by a male friend
of the girl along Turk street, where he
was captured by Policeman W. Coleman.
About ten days ago Acting Chief Blggy
received a letter from Colonel Maus of
the Marine Corps at Mare Island stating
that Neustadt was representing himself
as a naval officer and that he was "a
scoundrel and unmitigated liar." He
was arrested in Oakland about a year
ago -for defrauding people. He deserted
twice and served two sentences of six
months each and was dishonorably dis
charged last month.

CLASSIFICATION REPORT
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO
THE SCHOOL BOABD.
Pressure in Osrtain Districts Should
Be Believed â Petition for Be
znoval of Sunnysida School
Considered.
At the regular meeting of the Board
of Kducatlon yesterday Superintendent
Webster presented his final report on
classification,' in which he also made cer
tain recommendations. He. stated that
there was a class of more than forty reÂ»
cejving pupils in charge of a substitute
at the Starr King Primary School. The
last board had not authorized the per
manent establishment of the class until
it could be ascertained whether the pu
pils should not be assigned to the Whit
tier Primary. This Introduces the mat
ter of district lines of the Lincoln, Jef
ferson. Longfellow, Whittler, Starr King
and Stanford schools. The report con
cludes:
A consolidation of classes could be effected
at the Lincoln School so that Miss Hill
could be transferred to some other school
at her own request. Additional accommo
dations are needed In the Golden. Gate Pri
mary, where there are over seventy pupils
in the fourth grade. The district lines for
the Richmond School should be considered.
There are twenty-seven pupils awaiting ad
mission In the class which now numbers
eighty-one. The Park I'rlmary should be
utilized to relieve the pressure at the Rich
mond.
The ilfth grade of the Le Conte School
Is without a regular teacher. Miss M. H.
Slavan was transferred from the Cleveland
Primary to the Hawthorne Primary and
secured a leave of absence until she can
be assigned to a second grade. Miss Amelia
Ka'.lsher. whose leave of absence had ex
pired. Is entitled to reinstatement in the
evening schools.
A petition was received from the Sunny
side DlPtrict Progressive Improvement
Club and referred to the Hoard of Public
Works, for the removal of the Sunnyside
School to Flood and Circular avenues.
Gustave Schnoe said that the children are
menaced by fire In the present school and
that the seating accommodations are in
sufficient.
The application of Mr?. Irene M. Reeves
for reinstatement as teacher in the High
School, from which she wn.Â« removed
April 28. 1599. was placed on file. Chair
man Mark stated that Mrs. Keovea riatl
wal\"ed her rights and was not now In the
department. Â¦ . ; '
Madison Babcock filed an application for
appointment to the prlnclpalship of th*
Edison School, made vacant by the death
of Mlsb Chalmers.
ResoUitlons were adopted thanking
Mayor Phelan for his donation of $1000 for
a library in the Girls' High School; also
abolishing the title of principal in the fol
lowing one-room schools: Hunters Point,
J. W. Taylor, Ocean House and Cliff
House. ' Also electing J. J. Gallagher as
a regular teacher In the Mission High
School from January 1, 1900, and request
ing the Mayor to extend an Invitation to

Court Reporters' Demands.
The City Attorney has advised Treas
urer Brooks to continue in his course of
rejecting demands of court stenographers,
which have not bepn approved by
the Auditor and which do not otherwise
conform to the provisions of the charter.
The City Attorney in his opinion says:
"The charter has made provision for a
salary of $200 per month to be paid to each
of such stenographers engaged in criminal
departments of the Superior Courts of this
city and county. This salary is by express
language declared to be in full compensa
tion for services as a stenographic report
er and for transcription."

POLITICS AND PATRONAGE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 1900.
PHELAN WANTS TO
NAME ALL THE
EXTRA DEPUTIES
Organization Must Be
Cared For.
?
POLITICAL DEBTS UNPAID
' .
POLICE JUDGES AND COUNTY
CLERK HOLD OUT.
The Auditor, the Recorder, the Treas
urer, the County Clerk Â¦ and the Police
Judges will not be allowed to appoint the
extra clerks they need unleES his Honor
Mayor Phelan has the naming of them.
The Mayor needs that handy bunch cf
extra positions to make good his prom
ises of four places each to the eighteen
Assembly districts of the city, and he
proposes to have them, or there will be
no appointments.
In other words. Mayor Phelan Is ar
rogating to himself a power which the
charter does not give him. That instru
ment provides that, when additional
clerks are required in any department,
the head of that department shall sc no
tify the Mayor, who shall investigate the
case and report to the Supervisors, who,
if they pee fit. shall authorize the ap
pointments prayed for. which leaves the
appointing power solely in the hands of
the .head of the needy office.
Mayor Pholan announced to the Super
visors on Monday last that the depart
ments mentioned had called upon him for
extra help, but that he had not- had. time
to look into the matter. His Honor did
not pay, however, that he had been In
formed of the need of *Â¦ xtni clerical force
fully two weeks beforehand and had been
put in possession of facts Â¦ and figures
proving the necessity. Neither did he
vouchsafe the Information that, to thr.se
who came to him to discuss the matter,
he gave scant courtesy unless they came
bearing gifts of all, or a major portion, of
the patronage they asked for.
Every depart ment official who has dis
cussed the proposition with the Mayor
has been Riven to understand that the
"organization" should have a hand..An4
a FtronÃ oneâ in the naming or th 6 clerks
to be so employed, if the Mayor should
pee fit to recommend them to the Su
pervisors. Vpon that point the Police
Judges and County Clerk Deane stood
out. They were willing to accord the "or
ganization" something handeome if it
should be demanded, but they wanted the
selection of most of their own deputies.
They needed clerks of Ability and did not
car? to trust the so-called "organization"
to make the selections. The case is the
same at the present time as it was on
Monday, when his Honor had not had
time to consider." Deane and the Pojlce
Judpes. and. It 1? said. Auditor Wells, are
holding 1 out for their own appointments,
and there is likelihood that'there will not
be any clerks hired until they see the
error of their way and hand out the par
col the "organization" demands.

Stocking Superstitions.
On the Welsh border It used to be con
sidered that the surest precaution against
witchcraft was to wear the left stocking
wrong-side out. This leada us to another
kind of. superstition connected with the
harmless, necessary hoseâ their value,
when properly worn or arranged, as
charms or as protections against sickness
or pain. If you will only take the trouble
when you go to bed to cross your stock
ings and shoes, you will be quite safe
from the grip of cramp. Again, If you
hang your stockings crosswise at the root
of the bed, with a pin stuck In them, you
need have no fear of nightmare: the hag
has a holy horror of cross and pin. Wise
acres have also been heard to declare that
if you will always put your left stocking
and shoe on first you will enjoy Immunity
from toothache. This, however, the most
superstitious of mortals will likely take
leave to doubt. Toothache, that "hell of
a' diseases," as Burns calls It. is no re
specter of persons, nor, assuredly, of
stockings or legs.â Notes and Queries.

Wheat and Other Grains.
..WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris were both
higher and this market also advanced slightly.
Chicago showed little change. The opening
exhibited a reactionary tendency owing to the
elimination of the short Interest and the weak
ness in the coarse grains. Subsequently the
feeling became firmer, a Paris private cable
reporting the damage In the north of France
at 20 per cent. Local dealers fought the ad
vance in tho face of war rumors, and the mar
ket remalnr-d about the same.

Harrison's circular says:
"Since the Marlposa left there have been the
following cargoes of Colonial Coal delivered
here, viz.: Noeml 2963 tons, Schwarzenbek 3137
tons, Norfolk Island 2165 tons, Shenandoah 5129
tons. General Gordon 2401 tons, Arlstldes 2150
tons, Celtic Monarch 3394 tons. Clan Graham
5333 tons; total. 24,672 tons. These have been
the most generous arrivals we have had from
that section for some time and they came to
hand most opportunely, as the yards are abso
ly bare of fuel of all grades. Never before in
the experience of the writer has the present
situation existed; the quantity of fuel con-
Rumed and the sources of supply approximate
too closely for comfort, besides our usual re
serve In yard has been burnt up. Deliveries
are all being made from ship's slde-^none goes
Into yard. If any accident should occur at any
one of our principal coast collieries its effect
here would be serious and immediate. We
cannot expect much relief from outside sources
until coal freights decline from Great Britain
and Australia or there is a shrinkage In the
demand for Honolulu, > which cannot develop
itself before next year.
"The present list of engaged vessels from
Sydney and Newcastle only number eighteen,
of a carrying capacity of 64,000 tons; at this
time last year there were thirty-one vessels
chartered for San Francisco. The last cabled
freight rate for coal from Newcastle was 20s
per ton for early loading and 19s for several
months hence."

LOCAL MARKETS.
NEW TORK, Jan. 24.â Prices on the New
Tork Stock Exchange seemed entirely eub
eervlent to the movement of prices on the
London Exchange. The first sales of the In
ternational Â»tocks showed sharp gains in re
rpor.se tr> the rise achieved earlier on the Lon
don Exchange. These opening rains conform
closely to the net gains for the day. It
peemed Impossible to achieve any movement
of prices after the opening and the almost
ptagr.ant market drifted along at about the
opening level for the rest of the day. The
fralnn were closely proportioned to the previous
day's loi*es and probably measure the rectifi
cation of the ehort contracts put out yester
day on thÂ« exaggerated rumors of British re
verses !n South Africa. The whole movement
cannot be Raid to be more than sentimental,
as the actual news of the day failed to throw
any light on the Br>er war situation. In the
list of industrials and Fpedaltles. where the
properties concerned would feel no effect either
from success or defea.t In South Africa, the I
movement of prices followed sympathetically 1
that of the railroads. Di-alings In this de- I
liartment continued much larger than those in
the railroad department, but were strictly pro
fessional. The only reason discernible for for
the advance la prices was that there were de
clines yesterday. A considerable demand de
veloped later In the day for American Steel
find Wire, which carried it up an extreme
2%. and liÃted other iron and steel atocka In
sympathy. The stocks of properties operating
In New Yrrk public utilities also made a con
tinued phow cf Ftrength. News bearing on the
Industrial outlock was all favorable. Ft. Paul's
third weekly Ftatement. leading the returns
Jor that period, showed an Increase of over
$S?.000 over last year's unprecedented level of
earnings. TIK-re were pood third wtek state
ments also from the Wabash. Denver and Rio
Grande and Rio Grande Western. Less as
euranfe was felt with regard to the financial '
outlook. Money rates hardened a fraction In
London and Berlin and there wan a sharp free- I
tlonal rise In sterling exchange. Quotable
rates for money were not changed in New
York as funds continue to accumulate in new
banks. Hut the rate or accumulation shows
a considerable falling off from that of last
week. A further reduction of the Bank of
England rate of discount has been anticipated.
t>ut whether to-day's hardening money will
result in disappointing the expectation remains
to be Been.
The absorption, of railroad bonds continues
on a moderate scale, but to a lessened extent,
owinar to tne smaller Inflow of money. There

In the absence of news from- the seat of war
to-day there was a complete stagnation In the
markets here. The settlement was easy. Bank
ers charged I<4 I*"r cent for money and brokers
were oversupplled. The American Contango
opened at 4 per cent, but soon eased to 3\i, the
rate on St. Paul being only 3 per cent.
Americans advanced % point on an authen
tic rumor of a victory at Splon Kop. but re
lapsed on sales fmm New York. The bank
bought Â£21.0Ci0 gold In bars and lost Â£80,000
to India. The latter shipment was considered
light. Cable transfers commanded much lower
rates than last week, indicating that the India
gold demand has been exasperated. The week's
r.et outflow of specie was Â£59,000. It Is regard
ed as eertaln that the bank rate will be re
duced to 4 per cent to-morrow If news of a
victory In Africa should be received. Money

BOSTON, Jan. 24.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
A very active demand developed In the week
past for medium and low-grade wools, of
which the American Woolen Company and
other large mills have been free purchasers.
They have taken on some good-sized lines of
quarter and three-eighths blood fleecesâ notably
quartersâ the sales of such wools amounting to
something like two million pounds.
These purchases combined with those of one
or two good lines of territory, have brought
the total of the week's business up to slightly
over 5,000.000 pounds. Otherwise the demand
Is not p.t all active, and for fine wools It Is
practically nothing. There Is no Improvement
In prices, however, which may be quoted as
steady, and for most lines nominally un
changed. The sales of the week In Boston
amounted to 4,505,0 ! X> pounds domestic and
315,000 pounds foreign, making a total of 5.120,
000 pounds, against a total of 2.965,000 pounds
for the previous week and a total of 3.154. 000
for the corresponding week last year. The
sales since Jannarv 1 amount to 13,155,500
pounds, against 13,216.000 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year.

Prosperity of the South.
Henry Clews" New Ycrk circular says:
â¢"The granger roads continue to show large
earnings; likewise the trunk lines and several
roads running to the Atlantic ports. The Pa
cific roads are also making good returns. Some
of the Southern jropertles have not yet re
ceived the attention they deserve. The Siuth,
It Â«hould be remembered. Is Just now exper
iencing an exceptional period of prosperity.
The cotton crop has afforded a reasonable profit
to growers, for the reas >ns that prices have
ruled hiptx^r than last year, the cost of raising
if l^ss than formerly, and the utilization of
the peed for oil and cake has added materially
to Bootbera resources Tho most striking fea
ture of th<? South, however, Is Its marvelous
Industrial growth: not only In Iron, hut es
pecially In cotton manufacturing. During 1599
ptana were made for Investing not less than
SJO.unO.fifiO in cotton manufacturing, and al
ready It is stated on pood authority that the
Fmithern States contain f. "00.000 spindles
asainst 13.00u.000 In the New England States.
As yet there Is no fear of overproduction, for
the * South expects to largely produce the
cheaper class of fabrics a-.iltaMe for export.
China will prove a large buyer of these pro
ductw. end no section of the United States
liaÂ» a more vitnl Interest la the open door
Dollcv than the South."

HELPS ELECTRICITY.
Grape-Huts Build the Brain That
Does the Planning.
A famous electrical engineer, Foote,
who constructed the 3.000 horsepower
electric plant which supplies Battle
Creek, Kalamazoo and other Michigan
cities, says there is no food known that
will supply him with the vitality and
mental vigor from breakfast to noon
that Grape- Nuts will.
Mr. Foote, in conversation, said:
"There is no doubt left in my mind of
these facts. I have tried all sorts of
food, and kept track of the results. I
gain steadily^ in reserve force when I
use Grape-Nuts, notwithstanding my
occupation requires long continued and
concentrated brain work." There is no
artificial stimulant in Grape-Nuts. Noth-
ing but the stimulus of good food that
is scientifically prepared for immediate
assimilation into blood and tissu*.
especially brain tissue.
Brain workers can Ret sure and
understandable results by using Grapc-
fcutt.

SCORES McKINLEY
FOR SULU TREATY
Pettigrew Talks of the
Slavery Clause.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24.â When the
Senate convened to-day Halo reported
from the Appropriations Committee the
urgent deficiency bill and gave notice that
he would call It up to-morrow.
Allen offered a resolution calling upon
the Secretary of War i"<>r all information
and correspondence relatir.g to the admin
istration of customs iiffairs in Porto Rico,
Cuba and the Philippines, Eince the war
with Spain. Objection being made, it
Pettigrew of South Dakota offered a
resolution declaring that the United
r^iiir-s Government could not recognize
the right of any nation to declare as con
traband and seize food products as such,
and that any euch seizure would be an
act unfriendly to the United States. The
resolution went over under the rule.
The resolution offered yesterday by
Pettlgrew calling upon the President fur
the n-port of General Johu C. Bates con
cerning the treaty made with the Sultan
of Sulu was considered. Tho resolution
rccltod the salaries i>uid to ihe Sultan and
his officials, and inquired what fund they
were paid from and what services the otli
<Â¦....- rendered. Peuigrew supported the
resolution in a speech. He said that glav
ery i-> It* worst form existed in the Sulu
group Â«.f iflands. and tho treaty itself pro
videu that every slave could purchase his
freedom at the regular market price. He
paid th<? amount of the salaries paid to
the Sultan and his officials under the
treaty was K*l2o, yet the Spanish Govern
ment paid to them only $0300. A transla
tion ot the treaty, he said, was withheld
from the people until after the Ohio elec
tion?. Th;s was merely a part of the pol
icy of comialmcnt and censoring adopted
by the adniiiiistration.
Spooner of Wisconsin asked Pettigrew
if he meant to hold the President respon
etble for the slavery clause In the Sulu
treaty.
"I do," Pettlgrew replied.
"Then." said Spooner, "I read from the
n^^-ici 1 of the President to Congress.
The President says: 'I have coniirmed
said agreement subject to the action of
Congress, and with the reservation which
I have directed pliall be communicated to
the Sultan of J'-la that this agreement is
not to be deemed in any way to authorize
or five the consent of the United States
to thÂ«> existence ot slavery in the Sulu
MTChipclago.' *'
Pettigrew replied that there was no
assurance that the President's statement
would ever reach the Sultan. He declared
It was simply a case of double-dealing
and nothing' elpe.
At the conclusion of the address of
Petti^rew. Ijorise- of Massachusetts Fa!d
that, while the resolution was covered by
one previously adopted, there was no ob
jection to its passage. It was then
adopted.

ion g-iven yesterday by Attorney General
Mrey L. Ford.

Knauor in 1537. After trial he was sen
tenced to be hanged on March 3, 1533. A
short time prior to the date set for his
execution Knott showed unmistakable
signs of insanity and W. E. Hale, then
Warden at San yuentin, had the Superior
Judge of Marin County summon a Jury
to pa.^s on his mental condition. The Jury
found him insane and the prisoner has
since been confined in the hospital at the
penitentiary. The new Warden, not wish
ing tn have Knntt on his hands, asked of
the Attorney General what should be
done with him. Mr. Ford stated In reply
that Knott should be sent to one of the
asylums for insane until his sanity was
restored, when he would be sent back to
the prison and the Governor notified. The
duty of the chief executive then would
be to Issue a warrant for his execution.

Jacobson against Rabbi Isadore Myers for
the refund of moneys expended for trans
portation was finally submitted yesterday

charitable people. Mrs. Jacobson became
hysterial when Attorney Crowley told

decision.
MURDERER KNOTT'S CASE.
Warden Agulrre of tho State prison at
Fan Quontin will probably send Murderer
A. L. Knott to one of the State asylums
STRONG BILL
AT ORPHEUM
It Is the old story at the Orpheum.
There are all kinds of a good show there
this week, and not an item on the bill
that does not catch the house for a hermy
round of applause. Kdna Baesett Mar
shall has a novel act, or rather her com
pany of juvenile dancers have It, for
they do most of the work and deserve
moat of the credit. The clever trio of
youngsters give what is supposed to be
a curbstone frolic, and .do some very
lively acrobatics and dancing to the music
of a hurdy-ffurdy. The name of the girl
in the group does not appear on the pro
gramme, but, judging from her vivacity
and her clever variations on the time
honored cakewalk, she will certainly
achieve prominence in the course of ttnie.
Mile. Emmy has as good a company in
her trained fox-terriers as one could wish
to see and makes them do all manner of
wonderful things. Another worthy feat
ure Is the humorous songs of Joseph New
man. They are absolutely new and far
funnier than any similar cluster of ditties
that we have lately been asked to listen
to, moreover he sings them with a clever
ness that cannot fail to make a hit.
James O. Barrows and company con
tribute a comedy entitled "Tactics," In
which incidents of the civil war are re
cited by a veteran of the Confederacy and
an ex-Federal. There is a love story
woven into the plot and the strategy of
the 'young people, who make use of the
enmity that exists between their respec
tive parents to further their own ends, is
adroitly handled and results in cementing
in friendship the warlike representatives
of the North and South. Tho description
of the battle of Gettysburg, as Illustrated
by the two old soldiers, is full of humor
and the moral that lies In the skit seems
to make a genuine appeal to the audience.
Â¦ Papinta cannot fall to give pleasure
with her luminous dancing. The effects
produced by the aid of many-hued lights
and the background, of mirrors are as
beautiful as they are varied. I can im
agine nothing more astounding to the un
sophisticated in Papinta s art than tha
Bpectacle of this marvelous combination
of light and color. It is worth any one's
time to see her performance and It bears
peeing a second time better than most of
the acts that go to compose that remark
able development of modern times called
vaudeville. PORTER GARNETT.
FAILED TO SECURE
CONVICTION OF HARRIS
DRUMMER IS PROMPTLY AC
QUITTED BY A JURY.
Was Arrested Because He Protested
Against Not Being Allowed to
Carry Parcels Across
the Bay.
After nearly nine months' delay the case
of Henry Harris, a drummer for (Jold
stone & Co., 109 Battery street, charged
with disturbing the peace at the ferry
depot, was tried before a Jury in Judge

after three minutes' deliberation the Jury
acquitted the defendant.
Harris lives In East Oakland, and on
the evening of June 9 went to the ferry
carrying two parcels under his arm,
which he was to deliver, to customers of
the firm. The gatekeeper, C. P. Stod
dard, refused to allow him to pass, as
the company has a rule that no packages
of merchandise can be carried by a pas
senger on the ferries. Harris protested
and Stoddard called Policeman Callinan
and instructed him to arrest Harris for
disturbing the peace.
The case was prosecuted by Attorney
Kelly for the Southern Pacific and Attor
ney Davis represented Harris. Stoddard
testified that Harris had created a dis
turbance and Policeman Callinan testi
fied that Harris was speaking in an angry
tone of voice, but not sufficient to cause
a disturbance.
Harris and four witnessesâ E. Lee. W.
Dameron. H. Moore and J. Royi â all testi
fied that he did not make any disturb
ance, but conducted himself in a gentle
manly manner, and the Jury believed
them. The Jury v/as composed of J.
Hardiman, I* O. Adams. G. B. Levagei,
E Ryan. C. K. Howe, F. Hanak. C. H.
Wadsworth. Louis Argner. H. Brune, C.
A. Marshall, L. M. Boukofsky and T. B.

SAN ANDREAS, Jan. 24.â Yesterday afternoon George A. Stewart and
John Sefford of this place discovered a trail leading into an old abandoned
tunnel at Yacqule Camp, about two miles from here, and further examination
disclosed the den of a human being at the bottom of a chute 100 feet from
the entrance. The tunnel is all caved in and ingress in many places can only
be gained by crawling on the hands and knees. In the darkness a man could
be seen lying on a bed of rough boards. By the time a light was secured the
man got out and retreated to a drift In the further end of the tunnel. By tns
bed was found clothes, coal oil lamps, plenty of provisions and giant powder
and caps. The place was damp, the air foul and the odor from drying table
refuse nauseating. At first It was believed to be occupied by an insane man,
as it seemed impossible for any human to exist there, or possibly by a des
perate criminal, as a number of miners' cabins in the neighborhood had been
robbed of late.
The man would not come out and made no reply to questions. No one
dared go In after him. His bedding was set on fire, giant powder exploded in
the tunnel, a fire built at the entrance to smoke him out and a guard placed
at the opening. This morning, unable to stand the smoke longer, he came
out and was captured by Joe Marshall and turned over to Constable Oneto.
He gave the name of Joe Bush, and said he had lived In that hole for three,
months He is believed to be wanted for a serious crime, as he hides his
face from everybody. . Evidence of many burglaries was found in his posses
sion.
CHRISTIAN DAILY IS
ASSURED OF SUCCESS
Much Interest Taken Throughout
Kansas in the Special Church
Edition of the Capital.
TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 24.â The immedi
ate and extraordinary response of the
public to the announcement in the As
sociated Press Monday morning of the
Sheldon edition of the Topeka Capital Is
indicated by the fact that Mr. Sheldon
and the Dally Capital have been deluged
with telegrams and letters from all parts
of the country asking for information re
garding the proposed plans for a Christian
dally newspaper.
Among the dispatches received to-day
was one from New York containing an
order for 10,000 of each Issue during the
week. Another order by telegraph asked
for 5000 lines of advertising space.
The first subscription order, which came
within twelve hours of the announcement
of the plan, was from Nebraska, for 100
copies of each issue.
Requests have come to the Capital from
over a hundred newspapers in Kansas for
cuts of Mr. Sheldon to be used In their
columns. Mr. Sheldon said to-day that
while he would receive no compensation
for his services. It had been stipulated in
the original understanding with the Capi
tal Publishing Company that should the
receipts exceed the expenses of his edi
tion a large part of the proceeds would
be devoted to missionary and philan
thropic work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway. Jan. 21.
Thomas B. Freeman refuses to pay his
divorced wife alimony, and, according to
an affidavit filed in the Superior Court
this afternoon, boasts of his success In
defying the authority of the court.
In January. IW. Sarah Freeman was
granted a divorce by Judge Greene from
Thomas B. Freeman on the ground of in
fidelity. The defendant was directed to
pay $20 on the first of each month there
after for his wife's maintenance and
support, and there is now due $C 4 back
alimony*.
On the strength of Mrs. Freeman's affi
davit Superior Judge KUsworth issued a
citation directing the recalcitrant ali
mony debtor to appear before him on
February 5 and show causa why he
should not be punished for contempt of
court.
*lrs. Freeman's affidavit rerites that
she has been 111 and unable to arise from
her bed for the past several weeks; that
she has no means with which to pur
chase medicine and obtain medical assist
ance. She avers "that she has frequent
ly made demands on her ex-husband for
even small amounts, pleading with him to
do her Justice and have sympathy with
her deep affliction, and to contributn to
her anything he might feel able to gi\'e.
f>o that she might recover her health and
obtain employment, but defendant is deaf
to the voice of duty, and sneers at tho
majesty of the law; that he openly and
maliciously defies the court to punish
him for his refusal to obey Its orders.
"Defendant Is a hearty, able-bodied
man." continues the affidavit, "a first
class carriage-maker, capable of earning
the highest wages paid to his craft. He
resides at the Golden Eagle Hotel; that
he provides himself with every luxury,
dressing himself In the height of fash
lon, attends theaters and other places of
amusement, spends money freely and
flagrantly, and contemptuously refuses to
obey the court's order, boasting of his
success in defying the court's authority."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 24.â Mrs. Lucy Crao'ley, a youns woman traveling
from her home in St. Louis to San Diego, saw her little child struggling in
the agonies of death on the overland train this morning and firmly refused
offers of medical assistance. "The Lord will take care of the child." she
said when the railway doctor offered his services^ Passengers traveling on
the same Pullman pleaded with her. but all to no avail. The woman's faith
in her particular brand of fanaticism was absolute and unwavering. The
child died at Barstow at 3 o'clock this morning.
There was much indignation among the passengers and criminal proceed
ings were threatened. Deputy Sheriff Werdln of Los Angeles County
boarded the train at Barstow and took the names of the train officials and
passengers, who expressed a willingness to give testimony if charges were
brought.
Mrs. Crawley. who Is an attractive woman of about 30 year?, boarded
the train at St. Louis with her three-year-old son. bound to San Diego. On
the road the child developed a violent case of pneumonia. Some motherly
women on the train took great interest in the sufferings of the little bairn
and offered suggestions and. a steady flow of good advice about household
remedies. Mrs. Crawley gave them to understand that she was placing her
faith on a higher power than hot mustard applications and foot bath*. When
the train got to Needles last night It was plain to be seen that the child was
much worse, and two womenâ Mrs. C. P. Masters, bound for Anaheim, and
Mrs. T. F. Simpson of Inglewoodâ could stand it no long.-r. They simply
took the law into their own hands and Conductor Arthur Wild summoned the
railroad physician. The medical man was promptly snubbed. The mother
drew the curtains and refused to allow him to see the child. After the train
drew out the child's sufferings became worse, and when near Harstow his
gasping in the agonies of death caused the porter to look for a doctor on the
train. None could be found. Finally as the train rolled into Barstow death
came. The mother resented Deputy Sheriff Werdin's question?, but finally
told him her nameâ Mrs. Lucy Crawleyâ and that her home is in St. Louis.
The body of the child was taken from the train in Los Angeles and Is now
In charge of an undertaker.
Mrs. Crawley Said the Lord Would Take
Care of the Boy and Snubbed a
Physician.

CHICAGO. Jan. 24.â Government officers
to-day arrested Harry J. King and James
Prince, managers of the Chicago Em
broidery Exchange, on the charge of hav
ing swindled a number of women In all
parts of the country by advertising ex
tensively that women were wanted to sew
at home at a salary of J8 a week.
The correspondents were required to
make a deposit of $2 for supplies, and
when they sent this money they were
given a small lot of material to em
broider. This work having been done and
returned to Chicago, word was Bent that
everything was satisfactory, and that
further supplies would be sent on receipt
of $10.
Many of the alleged victims became
suspicious at this point and complaints
began to pour in on the postal officials.
The Inspectors say the mall of King and
Prince contained about 1000 letters a week.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 1900.
RAISING NORMAL
SCHOOL STANDARD
Thirty-Sfx. Pupils Dis
missed by Faculty.
. ?
6peclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan- 24.â Thirty-six pupils
were yesterday dismissed from the State
Normal School here by the faculty, each
being told they were not fitted for teach
ers and that they had not qualified In
their studies. This is the first time In
three years that such a cleaning out has
occurred, and it is evidently the first step
taken to raise the standard of students,
as decided on by the Board of Trustees
at the last meeting. Twenty-five of these
belonged to the first-year class and had
completed twenty weeks at the 6chool.
The other eleven belonged to the second
year class. Tills wholesale dismissal of
embryo teachers has caused a flurry
among the remaining 600 students, many
of whom fear the exodus will not stop
wherb It is. The last similar action of this
kind occurred four years ago, when less
than a dozen were dismissed. = Â¦Â¦Â¦- :,&Â¦
The action was taken by the faculty
upon recommendation of the teachera of
the general classes.
Coming as it does upon two charges of
favoritism that have been preferred
against Mrs. Place, head of the training
school, by Mrs. M. P. Kelly and H. A.
Miller, the action of turning away these
throe dozen pupils will have a bad effect
upon tho school. Some of these pupils
liKewise complain of unjust criticism of
their examinations.
The annual graduation of the spring
class will be held at the Normal Friday
morning. At that time thirty young la
dies and one young gentleman will be
given diplomas. Gfcorge C. Pardee of Oak
land will deliver an address to the claas.
Tho graduates are as follows: J. Dora
C. Andreason, Cora Helk Dam, Eliza May

BITTER FAMILY
FEUD OVER THE
LERRI SISTERS
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 24.
"I never want to go back to my mother.
She called me a dirty black thing and
paid she would throw me into the street."
These words, uttered by Cerenia
Lerri. aged 16 years, were virtually the
cause of aeicatine her mother's petition
to have two daughters, Cerenia and Ho
nora. aged 15 years, committed to Whit
tier Reform School.
Mrs. Honora Lerri is the widow of the
late Deputy Sheriff J. J. Lerri, who was
killed In the Mclrose powder explosion
about eighteen months ago. She alleged
that her two little daughters had become
incorrigible, so phe had them taken into
custody. She complained that they stay
out late of nights and run about. In
cidentally, the hearing of Mrs. Lerri's pc
tlon before Judge Ogden revealed a bitter
family feud between Mrs. Lerri. on one
side, her tv> half-sisters. Mrs. Alice Slat
tery and JtxTs. Lulu Phillips, and her
mother-in-law, Mrs. John Miller, on the
other.
All of the other women were opposed
to sertng the girls go to a reformatory,
Mrs. Miller, mother of the late J. J. Lerri,
being -particularly bitter. "I did not won
der the children are going wrong, for they
are simply following their mother's exam
ple." she exclaimed once during her tes
timony. "1 believe that when my son
went out to the powder works he did not
intend ever to come back. He wanted to
get rid of his life and miserable surround
ings. If Mrs. I*erri will pay me what
money I loaned to my son before ho was
killed I will gladly furnish a home for
the girls."
Mrc Lerri admitted that sho had been
left $5000 by her late husband. She owns
a grocery and carpet-beating works and
has 11000 in bank, but said she did not
feel able to pay anything toward the sup-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 24.
FOUR boys were arrested on tho
Oakland water front last night,
claiming that they were on their
way from San Jose to Alaska. They
were well dres.Â«e<J, and when searched at
the Oakland City Prison were found to
have revolvers, knives, playing cards and
crap dice on their persons. The boys gave
their names as Charles Moore, Steve de
Costa. Richard Howard and Robert Hol
man. and claimed that they had run away
from different homes in the neighborhood
of San Jose in order to make fortunes in
the Cape Xome country. They ranged in
age from 12 to 15 years, and the arrest
was caused by the fact that the boys got
into a quarrel over a dollar and attracted
the attention of Policeman Powers, who
arrested them upon general principles.
Young Moore claimed to be the son of
the chief of the San Jose Fire Depart
ment.
In preparing for their Alaskan voyage
the boys sreured a 22-callber pistol, a lot
of cartridges, a deck of playing cards
and a new pockftknife witii a long blade.
The pistol was dropped behind a table in
a Japanese restaurant on lower Broad
way, where they were arrested, but the
other articles were found In their posses
sion. Later the pistol was recovered.
De Costa is a bright little chap, rather
small for his age. but he was easily the
leader of the quintet. He told rather a
pathetic story to the police, but he
seemed fully able to take care of himself
wherever he might be placed.
"I lived with my mother and sister at
San Jose," he said, "and about two years
port of her children in any institution to
which they might be sent.
Judge Ogden stated that the county
owed something to the father of the girls
for his brave act at the Mcl rose explo
sion and it would not be right to tax the
widow for their support in a reforma.
tory.
At the conclusion of tho hearing Mr*.
Slattery agreed to take care of the
younger girl and Mrs. Phillips agreed to
pay for the support of the other if the
grandmother would provide a home. To
this. Judge Ogden consented and so or
dered.
DE CASTELLANE AGAIN
ATTACKED BY FIGARO
Editor Says That the Count Is Prov
ing by His Actions the Truth
of the Charges.
PARIS. Jan. 25.â The Figaro publishes
this morning a fresh cablegram from
Count Bonl do CastellanÂ© to M. de
Rodays, its editor, to which It appends
the following:
"Spurning with our feet the insults, we
find but one thing in this documentâ that
De Castellane energetically refuses any
intervention of the Inspector of Finances
in his adventure. We are now enlight
ened respecting his desire for light.
"He seems, moreover, to reproach us
for the outlay of the 200 francs which his
dispatch cost him. This is already the
commencement of a confession.
"There cannot fail to be surprise that
Gould's son-in-law should become so
careful In money matters. It needs but
little to Induce nim to demand that we
reimburse to him his 200 francs. Decid
edly he cannot have grown richer Jrst
recently."
The Figaro also prints a cartoon by Her
man Poul. entitled "The Arrival at New
York." This represents a customs official
searching a passenger. The official says:
"What Is In your satchel, M. le Comte?"
The passenger replies: "This is money
I am taking to my brothers-in-law."
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â Count de Cas
tellane to-day sent another long and abu
sive dispatch to M. de Rodays In response
to a shorter ' dispatch received by him
from the editor earlier in the day.
It is probably the excessivo liabilities
that make marriage a failure.
apo I found I would have to do some
thing to assist them. As I could sing and
dance, I went to San Francisco and did
a turn at the Chutes. Then I went to
Seattle, where I worked as a vaudeville
artist for several months. Hearing- there
was a chance for a boy in my line in
Alaska. I went to Skaguay and cleared
up $400. Then I came home, gave the
money to my mother and in a few months
made another trip to Alaska with similar
success. In one night on the steamer be
tween Seattle and Skaguay I made $70
singing and dancing. I left home this last
time with my mother's consent, but I
suppose the other boys ran away from
home. I intend to continue on my Jour
ney as soon as I am released."
Chief Hodgklns has notified the author
ities at San Jose, and it is probable that
all except De Costa will be returned to
their parents.

BIBULOUS BURGLAR
CAPTURED BY POLICE
OAKLAND. Jan. 24.â An appetite for
steam beer, coupled with a disposition to
steal, has landed John Shaw of 318 Sixth
street in the County Jail on a charge of.
burKlary. The young man broke into the
saloon of John Murphy, on Seventh street,
last night and, after imbibing a large
amount of the beverage the place con
tained, staggered out with a box of cigars
under each arm.
He insisted on giving a bunch of the
smokera to Peter Peterson, an employe
in the livery stable next door, and Peter
son reported the matter to the police.
Shaw was arrested and confined. He was
intoxicated at the time.

Cycling Clubs, the first that has been
held In three months, owing to lack of a
quorum, was held last evening In the

ciation Into an organization for the con
trol of road racing, the encouragement of
good roads and the general welfare of cy
clers, and transferring the control of
track racing to the National Cycling As
sociation. W. L. Loos of this city was
recommended as the representative of the
latter body on the Pacific Coast.
T/he amendments presented will be
acted upon at a meeting to be held Marc?.

11THOMAS U. SWfcENY.
DEATH yesterday morning claimed Thomas U. Sweeny, one of the first
settlers In what la now known as Sunset Valley, after a lingering Illness
of several months. The .deceased had been a sufferer from palsy for a
number of years, and had not attended to business, of any conse
quence of late.
The collecting of his rents and the management of his affairs he
entrusted to his brother-in-law, William E. Lane of 603 California street, to
whom he was much devoted. Unlike the great majority of wealthy pio
neers. Mr. Sweeny did not wait until after his death to distribute his means
to philanthropic purposes or the rearing of monuments to his memory. He
left one that will be a. reminder of his generosity as long as Golden Gate
Park exists. This monument Is known as "Sweeny's Observatory." It is
situated on the summit of Strawberry Hill, overlooking the broad Pacific
Ocean, the hills of Marin County, and the skirting southwest slopes of the
peninsula >n which he lived and died an honored member of society. In
addition to this monument, the forest of pine trees that stands on the lands
of the late Adolph Sutro on the wÂ«.st slope of the Twin Peaks were planted
by him years ago, and at a time when this Â¦ place was regarded an outside
settlement and too remote to be considered a portion of San Francisco. His
gift of tbo observatory to the people of this city and coast cost him about
120,000. "<:' k
The deceased was In his seventy-first year. He first saw the light of day
in Ihe State of New York, which he left in ISSI on board of a sailing vessel
destined for Chagres. Walking across the Isthmus of Panama, he sailed on
a ship for San Franciscb, where he landed after forty-nine days on March i,
1552, with but $15. After looking around San Francisco he went to Sacra
mento. On the night of his arrival the levee broke and the city was flooded.
For six days young Sweeny lived on bread and cheese. He next went to the
Diamond Springs mine, having by this time the sum of $150. in his pocket.
Fifty cents went for a pick and the same amount for a pan, and the last 50
cents for something to eat. After a year he returned to San Francisco.
Since the death of his wife ne resided at his home. 1401 Seventh avenue.
Being without Immediate heirs his estate, which is estimated at over $100,000,
will b<Â» divided between the relative* of his wife and some distant relatives In

HONORED LINCOLN'S MEMORY
ADVOCATES A MONUMENT ON
THE PANHANDLE.
Hon. M. M. Estee's proposed lecture at
Metropolitan Temple last evening: on
"Problems of Free Governmentâ Trusts,
Monopolies and Expansion" for the bene
fit of the Lincoln Monument League was
not delivered, the reason being the small
ness of the audience. But an entertain
ment varied In detail was promptly sub
stituted and thereby patriotism was stim
ulated. Mr. Estee spoke In a conversa
tional way, giving anecdotes of Lincoln
and urging all those present to be mis
sionaries to help the league to erect a
Lincoln monument in this city.
Judge M. Cooney presided. Mr. Orr
played a cornet solo. Miss P. E. Ryan
sang, accompanied by Miss Beatrice
Tojetti. Brief remarks were made by
Lieutenant Governor Neff, Judge Cooney,
Chief Justice Beatty, State School Super
intendent Kirk and General N. P. Chip
man as a prelude to the speech by Mr.
Estee. Judge Cooney announcea that
Lieutenant Governor Neff had when pars
ing the box office deposited $20 in aid ot
the cause, which fact was hailed with
applause.
Mr. Estee then told about Lincoln's pax
don of the sentry who slept on his post In.
the Wilderness and of the man who shout
ed "Louder!" when Mr. Lincoln was lec
turing, only to be told by that humorist
that he was not losing near as much as
he fancied if he did not hear. Then he
came to the work of the league. He sala
that between $2uUO and $3(XX> was In bank
to the credit of the fund. Five men had
to sign an order to get any of it out. One
of these was likely to die and then no one
could get it out. The fund was safe. What
was needed was to have it increased so
that a tine monument might be erectea
In memory of the great emancipator at
the lower end of the park panhandle at
Van Ness avenue when the park should
be extended. There it might stand to re
mind the coming generations that this
was the land of Lincoln and of Washing
ton; that this was the land of the free;
that one stroke of the pen made free four
million slaveÃ.
In his opinion any man who was born
in the United States and was not proud
of that fact ought to be shot. Nowhere
else on earth were there 75,000,000
of people so happy and prosperous, and
their happiness and prosperity were due
to the republican form of government.
Recently a rich New Yorker had gone out
of the country to live because It was
more aristocratic to spend his money
abroad. The country lost little in logins
him. Manhood was the Mrength of a free
country and not money. There weie no
imperialists among Americans. There
were expansionists, but expansion and im
perialism' were not synonomous. There
were no imperialists nearer than South
Africa, and they were getting pretty
badly licked. He hoped that every on*
present would go out to work for the
Lincoln monument..
After the address the audience sang
"America, being led by Cornetist Orr.
Then there were cheers for the memory
of Lincoln and brief rerrarks by MrÂ« F
S. Bowley, president of the Ladies' Auxil
iary of the league, which brought the ex
ercises to a close.
NO CRIMINAL INTENT SHOWN
Case of Felony Embezzlement Against
C. A. Hawkins Dismissed by
Judge Conlan.
The case of C. A. Hawkins, manager for
the White Sewing Machine Company,
charged with felony embezzlement by 11.
J. Devlin, ex-local agent for the company,
was dismissed by Judt;e Conlan yester
day. The Judge remarked that no crimi
nal intent had been shown, and the case
was one for the civil courts to decide.
Devlin had been under J2OOO bonds while
local asent, and after his discharge he
went with his bondsmen to Hawkins and
put up $2000 so that they could be released
from any liability. Hawkins retained the
money and declined to deliver up the bond,
as he alleged that Devlin was indebted to
the company in outstanding notes for ma
chines to an amount In excess of $2000.

Minerva Lyons Secures Judgment
Against Hotel Savoy Owners.
Minerva Lyons, who was seriously in
jured In an elevator accident in the Hotel
Savoy on October 11, 1898, was awarded
judgment yesterday against the owners
of the hotel. A. Aronson and V. Mene3i,
and the lessee, Mrs. Addle Hesthal, by a
jury In Judge Cook's court for the sum
of $7000. The plaintiff was hurled out of
the elevator and fell two stories Into the
basement. The testimony proved the
plaintiff's contention that the careless
ness of the defendant's employes waÂ« re
sponsible for the accident, and the ?ury
gave judgment In accordance with their
views.

NEWHOUSE ILLEGALLY
HELD FOR FORGERY
JUDGE DUNNE DISMISSES THE
CHARGE AGAINST HIM.
TJhpolds Defendant's Contention That
He Did Not Commit a Public
Offense and That It Was
Not Alleeed.
The charge of forgery against Oscar
Newhouse. made by his mining associate,
E. A. Wiltsee, has fallen, and Judge
Dunne has ordered the dismissal of the
defendant.
Newhouse was charged with having
forged a receipt purporting to have been
given him by the Fulton Engineering and
Shipbuilding Works on the payment of
$632 10 for machinery. Wiltsee claimed
that the receipt was not genuine, as it
had been raised. The defendant was held
to answer to the Superior Court on the
charge named. A writ of habeas corpus
was sworn out on behalf of Newhouse
and argued before Judge Dunne.
It was contended by counsel represent
ing the accused that the complaint -lid
not charge a public offense; that thv?re
was no evidence to show that the instru
ment alleged to be forged Is in fact a
forged Instrument or that it is not gen
uine; that there was no evidence to chow
that the instrument was ever uttered,
published or passed as true or genuine
to E. A. Wiltsee. or to any other person.
The court found that the contentions of
the petitioner were well based, and said
that, . after reviewing the testimony, it
appeared that the committing magistrate
held the petitioner to answer, not because
he was guilty of a forgery, "but because
he was guilty of some offense."
The writ was granted and the prisoner
was discharged.
PIONEER HALL was filled last night with argo
nauts and their children and grandchildren, gathered
to celebrate the anniversary of the discovery of gold
In California. The Society of Pioneers gave a recep
tion and ball, and not less than half a thousand guests ac
cepted the Invitations and enjoyed the lavish hospitality
of the men who crossed the plains In the forties.
Prior to the reception John S. Hittell gave a short ad
dress, recounting briefly the history of the pioneers. "To
day we celebrate the gold discovery in this, our State," he
said. "That discovery gave an Impulse to the industry of
the civilized world, increased the wealth and power of the
United States, lifted California from insignificance to
great Importance and changed the course of life for the
members of this, society. It threw them into a tumult of
business wonderful in magnitude and variety, bringing
them Into an environment most favorable to mental and
physical exertion.
"Those who came to California before 1850 and they
only are recognized by us as pioneers. They numbered,
excluding those of Spanish blood, about 100,000, of whom
one-half came overland in 1549. Some walked the whole
distance of 2000 miles, and thus became accustomed to
hardships. They were of necessity an independent class
of men, and any man might be proud to be one of them.
After 1852 the pioneers were a minority, and after 1557
they did not constitute more than one-tenth of the popu
lation of the State, while the total number who joined
the society did not exceed 3500."
The speaker referred to the achievements of those pio
neers whose names will be forever woven into the history
of the State, and leld of the evidences of State-buildingleft
by Lick, Hager, Adolphus Russ. Parrott, Flood, O'Brien.
Fair. Hawes, Halleck, Peachy. Billings, Tevls. Wll
merdlng, Field, Sherman, Dwindle, Randolph, Coleman,
Burnett, Larkln, Bidwell and Friable, most of whom are
no longer among the living membership of the society. Mr.
Hittell said that the State had been very generous to her
pioneers and had liberally rewarded their labors, as Is
evidenced by the large proportion who are, or who have
been, rated as millionaires.
After the address the floor was cleared for the ball and
for several hours the silver-headed pioneers had the satis
faction of proving that they are still as light of foot and
gay of heart as the generation that call them father and
grandfather. During the dreamy waltz the pioneers per
haps did not take the honors of the floor, but to the music of
the polka, the quadrille or the lancers, the men who
sought gold dust with pick and shovel half a century ago
were decidedly in their element, and but for the natural
evidences *hat years leave they might be thought to be
as young as when they watched dark-eyed senoritas
dance the cachuca at old Monterey or Yerba Buena.
Among the pioneers whose heads are white none entered
more thoroughly into the spirit of the occasion than ex-
Chlef Lees, who appeared to have taken on new life since
relieved of the task of catching crooks.
A banquet was served In the lower hall and on the
upper floor the dancers were served with pink lemonade
and "pioneer punch." The officers of the evening were:

"Trovatore" and other operas. After her
performance the hat was passed and
many nickels and dimes were collected
from the applauding crowd.
The young woman was Marie Storl of
the "Gay Coney Island" Company, now
at the Alhambra. A few minutes before
she had approached a professional street
violinist and asked him to lend her his
instrument for a few" minutes in order
to earn a few dollars for him. He readily
consented. The crowd caught on to the
idea, and in very little time the street
was blocked with people.
Some say that the performance of Miss
Stori was on a wager, others that it was
a press agent's scheme. The violinist
didn't care which, seeing that he got the
returns.
Elected Director of the
New York Central.
SUCCESSOR TO H. J. HAYDEN
WALL STKEET BELIEVES THE
ROAD IS STRENGTHENED.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â D. O. Mills has
been elected a director of the New York
Central Railroad to succeed H. J. Hay
den, resigned. In consideration of long
and valuable services, Mr. Hayden Is to
be retained as vice-president, although
the duties of that officer are now merely
perfunctory. Speaking of the election of
Mr. Mills as a director, President Callo
way said:
"This Is significant only as marking the
carrying out of Mr. Vanderbllt's policy
to have the very best men In the New
York Central board. '
D. O. Mills Is one of the largest stock
holders in the Erie Railroad and a direc
tor in the Lake Shore. He has large
financial interests with J. Pierpont Mor
gan and with the Rockefellers, and the
railroad financiers of Wall street regard
his entry into the New York Central as
strengthening the Vanderbllt-Morgan-
Rockefeller combination.
Another matter of Importance deter
mined by the New York Ceneral direc
tors to-day was the taking over of all of
the dining and lunch rooms along the
lines of the system. Hereafter the pas
senger department of the New York Cen
tral will control and operate all of the
station dining rooms, as well as the din-
ing cars.
Senator Chauncey M. Depew attended
the Vanderbllt meeting to-day, and as he
was leaving the board room he was asked
If there was any truth in the stories that
the Chicago and Northwestern Railway
Company was to lease the Union Pacific.
Without hesitation he replied: "There is
not a word of truth In the stories. The
Chicago and Northwestern will not lease
the Union Pacific.
President C. P. Huntlngton of the
Southern Pacific Railway Company said
to-day that Darius O. Mills had been' a
director of the company for two months
and that It was likely that John W.
Mackay would become a director soon.
In what measure these new directors
could be considered the direct or personal
representatives of the interests which
bought the Crocker or the Stanford
stock he did not say. â¢
! ers of a healthy public policy or a de
cent manhood.
His hearers were dumfounded. This
was a depth of political dishonor to which
they did not think he would descend.
And then they returned to their own
meeting-room. Mayor Phelan had an
gered them, insulted them and disgusted
them. He had attempted to place upon
them the consequences of his own politi
cal mistakes and they resented his lnpu
dence. In the last analysis it Is they who
will be responsible In lost dignity and
stained honor and they still Insist that
they are something more than playthings
of the Mayor.
After they had left the Mayor's office
Esola entered into the presence of his
Honor to confer and counsel with him.
But the ambitious lieutenant did not seem
to receive much encouragement. He has
discovered through his sponsor that it Is
not easy to buy men of honor. The Police
Commissioners discussed the matter in
secret session for two hours and then ad
journed until to-day at 4 o'clock.
At this time It is expected that three
reports will be filed in reference to the
investigation of Esola. These reports
will be submitted by Commissioners New
hall, Thomas and Blggy. Commissioner
Newhall will find that Esola is incom
petent for the position he seeks. Com
missioner Biggy will decide that Esola is
Incompetent and that there are other rea
sons why he should not be Chief of
Police. Commissioner Thomas will also
file a judgment of incompetency against
the lieutenant, but will clear him of the
charges preferred by an evening news
paper.
Shameful Tactics of the Mayor in His
Desperate Effort to Carry Out His
Disgraceful Compact. '
THE Police Commissioners hara not
yet named a Chief of Police. They
met yesterday afternoon and for
nearly two hours in secret session
discussed the momentous problem
before them, but reached no Â«-on
clusion, There is a deadlock in the com
mission, two members standing ready to
deliver themselves, their personal honor
and political future as the chattel pledges
ct Mayor Phelan'a debts, and the other
two members insisting that they cannot
be cold to satltfy any man's obligations
cr.d will rot be stamped with the shr.ms
ful mark that will make them another
man's property.
Mayor Phelan !s striving with the des
peration of a losing gambler to make
grood his ante-election bond. His impu
dence in striving with every effort of offi
cial power to hell four honorable men to
blacklegs has stung two of the Commis
doners. They rightly consider themselves
as worthy as he in the scales of mental
or moral worth. They have as much and
more to lose in the estimation of the peo
ple of San Francisco as he, and they have
a future which they do not care to jeop
ardize or stain by a dishonorable act.
The Mayor, however, seems to forget
this, and he attempted again yesterday to
force the Commissioners, who will not
bare themselves to his brand, to appoint
Esola Chief of Police. Mayor Phelan has
now utterly discarded the mtisk which he
attempted to hold to his face. He no
longer pretends to occupy a position
either of honor or dignity. He is almost
a s^lf-a vowed scheming, greedy, unscru
pulous politician, using his office to ad
vance his political fortunes at whatever
cost may follow to the people of San
Francisco.
He is not blind to the consequences,
which have followed the expose of his
base motives and selfish schemes. He has
winced under the excoriation of the news
papers of the State as well as of the city.
Even in his blind egotism he can see that
his plot to turn the Police Department of
this city into a huge aÃency of evil has
brought upon him the contempt and the
condemnation of the people of California.
And now he lusts for the poor vindica
tion that he thinks will come with the
eucce^s of his unworthy compact.
He made yesterday a piteous appeal to
two of the Commissioners to elect Esola
at least acting Chief in order that he.
the Mayor of the city, may rind some Jus
tification for his unworthy conduct in a
partial success. He had already used his
tactics of threat and insinuation, but to
no purpose. He then begged for a com
promise, so that he may crawl from out
of the bargain which is playing such
havoc with his political hopes. He asked
those Commissioners to appoint Esola at
least in a temporary capacity and then
at their pleasure to remove him.
The Mayor cares nothing now for the
ambitious lieutenant and his absurd pre
tentious. The storm of public indignation
is about the ears of his Honor and it is
he who must endure its ravage. But the
Commissioners would not compromise.
They hold their honor not so lightly as
does his Honor.
Ho thinks that by making Esola Chief
of Police he will, in a wretched victory,
save himself from the confusion of utter
failure. He never can restore himself to
<he position from which he has fallen, but
he thinks that it is better to be a success
ful manipulator than a thoroughly routed
and unmasked schemer. So he sent yes
terday for certain members of the com
mission and begged them to give their
votes to Esola. He acted in precisely the
capacity of a man who attempts to bribe
a jury. He used his high office as a club
and a menace, prostituting its power to
as base uses as ever it was put.
The Mayor told these Commissioners
that he must van and that his victory is
Involved in the election of Esola as Chief
of Police. The good name of the Mayor of
this city has become dependent upon the
success of a man with an alias, upon the
victory of a perjurer, upon the triumph
of a petty official, who was once dismissed
from a place of responsibility for lncom
petency. This Is the disgraceful position
now held by the Mayor of San Francisco.
He Insisted yesterday that Esola be
elected. That was his single thought,
Â¦which had driven from his brain all oth-
