CRONJE FIGHTS DESPERATELY
AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS
While the Free Staters Have Inflicted, Fearful Slaughter Among the British Troops,
It May Be Impossible for Them to Hold Out Until Reinforcements Arrive.
Kitchener Refuses an Ajrmistiee, and the Boer General Will Battle to the Death.
T ONDON, Feb. 23, 5 a. m.â London enthusiasm over Lord Roberts' operations fo the Orange Free State was
Jjstruck all of a shiver last night by rumors that ran about the public places. ?Men in the service and in political
clubs and the big hotels were informed that the War Office had edited Lord Roberts' reports in regard to his
engagement with General Cronje.
It was said that the Highland brigade had met another disaster in attack upon the Boers in strong position.
The reports could not be traced to any definite source, but well-informed men declare the War Office knew the
Highland brigade had been again trapped, and the Black Watch and another regiment had been nearly wiped out.
The war critics and experts placed considerable credence in the report of the disaster because of the long
list of killed and wounded officers, including General Mac Donald and other Highlanders. These experts declare the
censor was evidently hard at work oh all newspaper reports.
No detailed account of the fight has yet been received in London, but one agency managed to get through and
publish in the afternoon papers a statement that the battle about General Cronje's laager was "a replica of Ma
gersfontein." fiiX Magersfontein the Highland brigade marched up against a barbed wire fence under deadly rifle
fire and^General Wauchope was killed, while a great number of other officers and men were either killed or wounded.
FREE STATERS SEEMINGLY
MAKING THEIR LAST STAND
*Â»- ONDON. Feb. 23, 4a. m.â General Cronje Is seemingly making his last stand. He is dying hard, hemmed in by
f British Infantry and with shells from sixty guns falling into his camp.-
LOn the third day of the fight the Boer chief asked for an armistice to bury his dead. "Fight to a finish or
surrender unconditionally," was Lord Kitchener's reply. General Cronje Immediately sent back word that his re
quest for a truce had been misunderstood and -that his determination then, as before, was to fight to the death.
The battle went on. This was the situation of General Cronje Tuesday evening, as sketched In' the scanty telegrams
that have emerged from the semi-silence of South Africa.
Officially Lord Roberts wires that he has scattered the advance commandoes of the reinforcements that were striv
ing to reach General Cronje. It is regarded as singular that Lord Roberts wiring Wednesday should not mention the
appeal for an armistice on the previous day and also that the War Office should withhold good news, if it has any.
Without trying to reconcile even the scanty materials at hand it seems plain that General Cronje Is in a bad and
even a desperate situation and that the British are pressing their advantage.
While the attack on General Cronje proceeds there is a race for concentration, between the British and the Boers.
The engagement with General Cronje's five to eight thousand Intrenched men Is likely to become an incident in a battle
between the masses. The separate factions of the Boer power are rapidly drawing together to. attack Lord Roberts.
Will General Cronje be able to hold out until, the Boer masses appear, or if he does, will they; then be abie to'
euocor him? The British are facing the Boers on ground where the arms, tactics and training- of f the British are ex
pected to give them the advantage. . . ? ,
General Buller. according to a dispatch from Chieveley, dated Wednesday, finds the Boers in position north of the
Tugela largely reinforced. This seems strange. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
The War Office, for the first time, has given out an official compilation of the British loeses. ' The total Is 11,280 to
February 17. This does not include, therefore, Lord Roberts' recent losses, nor the Wiltshire prisoners.
The press association learns that the British losses at Koodosrand were 700.
Three thousand fresh troops will embark for South Africa to-day.
The relative position of the combatants is likened to chess players, one of whom from time to time adds pieces to
the board, while any loss to the adversary is irreplacable. Mfss

LONDON, Feb. 23.â The Dally News

The Boer forces under General
Cronje are estimated at 8000 men: At 12
o'clock Cronje asked, an , armistice of
twenty-four hours, which was 'refused.
Later he sent a messenger; to . say . that
he would surrender. The British general
sent a reply telling him to come into
camp. Cronje refused, saying there 'had
been a " misunderstanding and r -that , ' he
would fight to. the death.
The bombardment was . then; reopened,
and the British lyddite shells set fire to
the Boer wagons. The British continued
shelling the laager through the night, and
in the morning it was/resumed with 'Max

ENGAGE IN FURIOUS BATTLE
CRONJE'S BEST CHANCE
LIES IN NIGHT ATTACK
LONDON, Feb. 23.â Spencer Wilkinson,
reviewing the military situation In the
Morning Post, says:
"Lord Roberts, who was once an- ar
tillery officer, will take care that the ar
tillery fire Is properly concentrated. Pro
longed shelling will compel the Boers
either to hurl themselves at the British
Infantry In the hope of forcing their way
out or to surrender.
"The best rhance for General Cronje
would bÂ« to make a nigbt attack, but the
bayonet will serve the British at night as
well as by day. There are, of course, in
war all sorts of chances. A party of
Boers from the north or .south . might
conceivably fall by surprise on some point
of the investing ring and thus gain a
chance to escape from the beleaguered
Boers, but the probabilities are that Gen-
eral Cronje will be compelled to surren
der, and thus at Paardeberg will be ef
fected the destruction of the first frac
tion of the Boer army."

PAARDEBERG DRIFT. Orange Free State, Tuesday,
Feb. 20 (via Modder River, Wednesday. Feb. 21).â One
of the costliest actions of the war occurred at Paarde
berg Drift Sunday, February: 18. General Kelly-Kenny,
In his pursuit of General Crouje. caught his rear guard
at Klip Drift and followed the burghers to . the Boers' laager
at.Koodoosrand. The drift action began ,at daybreak, the
mounted infantry driving the Boer, rear guard up the river
toward the main body,, while another body of mounted infan
try, maneuvered on the right fronk and flank ' of the Boers.
The British main body advanced to outflank tUe Boers'
laager on the north bank of the river. General Kelly-Kenny
having 'seized two drifts, found the Boers strongly inclosed
and'ordered an attack with -, the Highland brigade on the left
and # Gene.ral Knox's brigade on, the center, and . right, while
General Smith Dorrlen's . brigade crossed' the river and ad
vanced along the north bajik. ."lfi&SjKSSS . .. â¢ /'
On. both the north and south banks the ground is level
and. the advance across this was deadly and the British losses
were heavy. The battle was an exact replica of the Modder
River. .The 'soldiers; were under fire all day and all the fight
ing, had no definite result, as the Boers' laager was well bar
ricaded and ; they /remained therein. The British guns shelled
the laager .vigorously, and the Boers confessed to a loss of

General .Cronje's magnificent night , march, from Magers
fontein now. appears likely to end . in disaster. The main
body, of. the; Boers is. inclosed in a terrible death trap. The
enemy Is hiding In 'the. bed of the Modder, commanded by the
British artillery and Inclosed on the ' east and west by the
British Infantry. Sunday witnessed "a gallant stand on the
part 'of the retreating foe.
.TJred,. harassed,, they still maintained a. bold front. It is
somewhat -.difficult ; to explain the Sunday action In which all
the Â¦ British ; force was engaged. In which General Cronje. un
der difficult conditions, -managed to hold his own. On Satur
day night -the < British mounted infantry came In touch, with
'Cronje's rear. guara, 'driving. them ;back upon the main body.
On' Sunday' morning- the action was renewed.' but the Boers,
who had Intrenched -the river bed during the night, prevented
a further advance of the mounted infantry In this direction.
Meanwhile the Highland brigade, consisting of the Seaforths,
the Black "Watch and the Argylls. advanced from the south
bank, and the Essex, Welsh and Yorkshires formed a long
line on the left, which rested on the river, the extreme right
being the Welsh. The whole line was ordered to envelop thÂ«
Boers, who lined both banks of the river.
The firing soon became heavy. The Boers, holding a splen
did position, covered the left of the Highland brigade, which
advanced partly up the river bed and partly In the open, while
the rest of the brigade, with the other regiments, swung
around the front of the Highland Brigade on the level, cover
less ground, exposed to a terrible fire, which obliged the men
to He upon the. ground as they did for the remainder of the
day. This began at 7:30 in the morning. Through the dread
ful heat and a terrible thunderstorm the British hung to th<
position, answering the Boer fire and shooting steadily.
In the. meanwhile the rest of the infantry completed the
enveloping movement, the Welsh regiment having succeeded
In seizing the drift, thus closing in the Boers, who had fought
throughout with splendid. courage.
General Cronje"s laager, full of carts, ammunition and
stores, could be plainly seen near the north bank.
General Smlth-Dorrlen collected a large body of men. In
cluding the Canadians, and crossed the river by Paardeberg
Drift, advancing toward the laager, which was being vigor
ously shelled. This force made a gallant attempt to charge
into the laager, but failed. Before seizing the western drifts,
the Boers occupied a kopje on the south bank, running dowr,
the river. Therefore, their force is cut in two. The Boers
hold the kopje and have one Vlckers-Maxlm and probably on*
or two other guns. Toward evening the battery on the south
side opened, co-operating with the battery on the north side
A. wonderful sight followed. The shells fell with amazing
precision along the river bed, opposite the laager, which was
shelled thoroughly, galling everything it contained. One shel
set on fire a small ammunition wagon, which burned nearlj
all day.
Many other wagons, were set on fire and the glare was
visible at a considerable distance far into the night. The in
fantry also, maintained a terrible fire, which was answere<
vigorously.
The scene toward nightfall was terribly picture* iue wit!

. A special dispatch from Pamrdeberj,
Continued on Second Pag*.French papers, is published to-day. The
colonel says that. two of the Creusots' rep
resentatives rendered the Boers valuable
aid. One . named Greundberg; he, adds, is
the head of their artillery, and the other,
Leon, is the head of their engineers. They
directed the hoisting of "Long Tom" to
the dizzy heights around Ladysmith, and
also arranged for the victualing of the
camps, which he himself located.
The writer expresses admiration of the
organization -and commissariat arrange
ments of thp Boer camps. These, burgh
ers, he says, get excellent meat, bread or
biscuits, coffee, rice, potatoes and other
condiments with surprising liberality. He
pays a high tribute to the unsuspected
military capabilities of the Boer leaders,
and declared every detail of the Boer
organization works like clockwork.
LORD ROBERTS' REGRETS.
OTTAWA, Feb. 22.â Lord Mlnto, Gover
nor General, has received the following
from Lord Roberts:
"PAARDEBERG, Orange Free State.
Feb. 22.â The Canadian regiment has done
admirable service since its arrival In
South Africa, I deeply regret the heavy
loss it suffered during the fight on the
18th lnst., and beg you will assure the
people how much we all here admire the
conspicuous gallantry displayed by our
Canadian comrades on that occasion."
MRS. KRUGER VERY ILL.
BRUSSELS, Feb. 22,â Private letters
from 1 Pretoria received here announce
that Mrs. Kruger, the wife of the Presi
dent, is very ill. The war has grievously
impressed her, and her health Is also im
paired by her anxiety for her numerous
sons and grandsons fighting for their
country, one of whom was killed at
Deerdepoort.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22.â The
next national Democratic con
ventlon will be held at Kansas
City July 4. This was the de
cision of the Democratic Na
tional Committee, which met at the Hotel
Raleigh to-day to fix the time and place
of holding the convention. . Milwaukee
was the only city which competed for
the honor of entertaining the convention,
and the poor showing she made when the
vote was taken (the result being Kansas
City 40, Milwaukee 9) caused general sur
prise.
The claims of the rival cities as to hotel
accommodations, railroad and telegraphic
facilities were presented in open session
by representatives of each city and sub
sequently in executive session. Governor
W. J. Stone, on behalf of Kansas City,
and National Committeeman E. C. Wall,
on behalf of Milwaukee, explained the
financial inducements which the cities
they represented were willing to make.
Each offered the committee $50,000, but in
addition Kansas City was willing to fur
nish hotel accommodations for tne mem
bers of the committee and the hall with
decorations and music free of expense to
the commltitee. One of Milwaukee's
strongest arguments was the political ef
fect which the holding of the convention
in that city would have upon the Ger
man-American voters, who were repre
sented to the committee as wavering in
their allegiance to the Republican party.
Bryan to Be Benoxninated.
It seemed to be taken Â¦ for" granted by
at least two speakers that Bryan would
be renominated, and that the Chicago
platform in substance would be reaf
firmed. Opposition to trusts, expansion
and imperialism, together with every
mention of Bryan and the Chicago plat
form, aroused enthusiasm, but during the
open session of the committee there was
no allusion to the issue of free silver.
Three dates for holding the convention
were proposedâ May 9, by Mr. Townsend
-of Oregon; June 14, by Senator Tillman of
South Carolina, - and July 4, by Mr. Mc-
Graw of West "Virginia. A speech by ex-
Senator Gorman In favor of holding to
precedent and naming a late later than

After tho committee had selected the

CAPE TOWN, Feb. 22.â 1n reply to Gen
eral Cronje's request for' an armistice of
twenty- four hours to allow him to bury
his dead, Lord Kitchener told the Boer
commander that he must fight to a- finish
or surrender unconditionally. General
Cronje's position is reported hopeless.
TIMES URGES ROBERTS
TO PRESS THE BATTLE
LONDON, Feb. 23.â The Times says ed
itorially: "The fact that the Boers started
to reinforce General Cronje from Natal
days ago Is an additional reason why
Lord Roberts should finish with him as
promptly as possible. Lord Roberts at
present has the advantage of being nearer
his base than the Boers are to theirs,
but this advantage will be reduced as his
forces progress and it Is important that
bodies of the enemy should not hover on
his right flank."
Commenting upon Lord Salisbury's re
ply to Lord Teynham's question regard
ins the assertion that Great Britain was
bound by a secret treaty with Germany
which would secure some measure of in
dependence for the Boers the Times says:
"There would be no precedent for any
Interference unless the Boers were
crushed, even if anybody felt bold enough
or strong enough to try to rob the victors
under unctuous pretexts of humanity and
mercy to the vanquished. Nobody we
Imagine does feel strong or bold enough
to try who Is at the same time hostile
enough to England to wish to try."
The Times then proceeds to argue that
the British navy was stronger than Â¦at
present, adding:
"This war has given an Immense ex
perience, which will tend to make Great
Britain stronger than ever before in a>
military 6ense, while the Indian troops
and the colonists have evidenced their
loyalty In a time of adversity which gives
additional strength. What Germany has
achieved in the Reichsland we shall ac
complish in the Boer republics. It is not
enough for us to conquer the Boers. We
shall not rest satisfied until they are loyal
and patriotic British citizens." \

The vote on fixing the date of the con
vention was as follows: In favor of July
4, 27; June 14, 21 votes; May 9, 1 vote.
Gorman Carried the Day.
A speech which had a great deal of in
fluence in fixing the date was made by ex-
Senator Gorman. He said that four years
ago it might have been well to have the
convention early, as the party then took
a new position, one which drove many of
the leaders out of the pary or Into tem
porary retirement. The organization then
went into new hands, into the hands of
able men, but many of whom had not beffn
active in control of party affairs. It took
them some time to organize.' Now there
was a good organization. The party was
ready and equipped to enter upon the
campaign. The party in power should be
allowed to hold its convention first and
the indictment of that party could be
made as it has been in times past.
Mr. McLean of Ohio also favored the
latter date.
The committee decided the District of
Columbia contest for national committee
man in favor of James L. Noyes. A sub
committee was named to audit the ac
counts of the committee. Chairman Jones
was authorized to appoint a sub-commit
tee of seven to make arrangements for
the convention. It is probable that Messrs.
Stone of Missouri and Jbhnson of Kansas
will be members of this committee. The
National Committee issued the following
call:

Joy at Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, * Feb. 23.-Genuine satis
faction was expressed on all sides this
afternoon on receipt of the news that the
National Democratic Convention is to be
held here. Kansas Cityans, Irrespective
of party, have for months past worked
diligently to secure the convention, and
now that their efforts have proven suc
cessful have already begun seriously to
plan to entertain their guests.
Telegrams by the score are coming in
to the hotels engaging accommodations.
These were fewer than would have been
expected from the fact that the managers
of the leading hotels were with the Kan
sas City delegation in Washington, and
numerous engagements for quarters were
doubtless made with them. As early as
ten days ago suites were engaged at the
leading hotels conditional on the conven

It Is a Great Hall.
Convention Hall, where the National
Democratic Convention will be held In
June, is Bltuated at Thirteenth and Cen
tral streets, four blocks from â¢ the retail
district of the city. It has been classed
by travelers as one of the largest and
most perfectly constructed auditoriums in
existence. The building was erected at a
cost of $225,000, which was raised entirtly
by public subscriptions. It occupies a
piece of ground 314 by 200 feet in extent,
Is two stories high and Is built of native
stone, cream brick and terra cotta. Tht
first story is Renaissance style of archi
tecture, and the second story Is in peri
style form, with groups and columns. The
building Is of bridge construction, without
a column, the roof being supported by
great steel girders that span Its 200 feet
of breadth. Its general seating arrange
ment is modeled somewhat on the plan of
the Metropolitan Opera-house, New York.
The floor space is divided into arena,
arena balcony, balcony and roof garden,
.boxes skirting the arena and the arena
balcony. The stage Is Bltuated ln-the cen

more than 22,000 people. The arena alone
seats 4000. To each side of the arena and

street entrances. The building has no
stairways, the upper ' seatlngs being
reached by means of inclined planes. Sep

KANSAS CITY'S NEW CONVENTION HALL.
WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION WILL BE HELD,
HONOLL'LU, Feb. 15.â Black plague has
broken out at both Kahului. on Maui, and
Hilo, on Hawaii. The latest advices re
port Beven cases. at Kahulul and one
Hilo. */~ *Â¦'<â¢:;> '-n
The news of the plague waa received
here on the afternoon of the 10th, coming
by Eteamer Kaual from Lahalna, that
four sudden deaths had occurred at Kah
ului within a week. The letter was from
Sheriff Baldwin and was sent by Horse
from Wailuku to catch the steamer at
Lahsina. The Sheriff stated in it that he
had registered specimens taken from the
body of one of the patients for bacteriol
ogical examination by the board.
About an hour later the postofflce au
thorities telephoned that there was a-reg
istered package in the office fom-Lahaina.
It was immediately sent for and was
found to be the glands from the body of
a plague victim. The very first "smears"
developed the bacilli In unmistakable
form. The President of the Board of
Health left the same night for Kahului
to make a personal investigation. He
found that seven Chinese had died with
the plague, the bodies afterward being
cremated.
The conditions In Chinatown of Kahului
were found to be worse than In Honolulu.
It was Immediately apparent that the
only remedy was fire, and this has been
applied.
A census showed a little tinder 200 peo
ple. There had been nearly 300 In the
Mock. As far as possible all those who
have left have been located and will be
*ent back. Of the seven deaths, five
bodies were buried. They will be dug up
and cremated.
Lahaina and Hsna had both established
quarantines against other portions of
Maui. Lahaina had established the Hono
lulu system of house-to-houso inspection,
end Dr. Wood had advised all of the com
munities to follow the same example.
An unfortunate feature of the case is
the proximity to Kahului of several large
jilantatlons. "with thousands of laborers
uron them. In sight of the town are vast
estates of the Hawaiian Commercial.
Tula Sugar Company. Kihel, Hamakua
j.oko mill and the Wailuku Sugar Com
j.sny. The Board of Health realizes the
of the disease petting a foot
hold at these point*, and Dr. Wood will
take- extraordinary precautions to prevent
tuch.
Disinfectants Plentiful.
Maui 1s fortunate Just now in having
n bountiful supply of disinfectants. All
the plantations are equipped. By the last
vrspel, the Claudine, 1300 pounds of sul
phuric acid were shipped to Kahului for
the Hawaiian Commercial Company. This
invaluable material at this juncture was
probably still on the wharf at Kahului on
Saturday. Georpe Hons. a prominent at
torney at Wailuku, Maui, was sent to this
<ity to make a verbal report on health
affairs. In an interview he said that he
Â¦was- certain that there was no infection
Â«n Maui outside of Kahului and stated
thrit the plapue there was confined to a
very small space in the town. "All of
the cases that have occurred as well as
? very case that we mipht now be inclined
to think was suspicious came from the
Ftores that are now in strict quarantine."
faid Mr. Hons. "I do not think the dis
ease is likely now to spread beyond that
Faction. There have been no reports of
sickness that can be called dangerous
from any other part' of the island. It is
true that there have been rumors from
other places, but they had no other foun
dation than a number of cases of fever."
â¢which are not of a serious kind.
"The shipment of Chinese poods for the
new year is thought to have been the
means by which the plague reached us.
Some stuff that has been at Kahului for
two months was opened at New Year's
time and then began the suspicious illâ
ness. Not a case has occurred that has
rot been traced to contact with these
poods in some way."
The Maui authorities think they have
hit upon the cause of infection. They
rÂ«-late that over two months ago a ship
ment of poods arrived from China via
Honolulu to be used on Chinese New
Year. These boxes were tiot opened until
on or about January 31. It is related that
most if not all of the people affected
*ithor ate or came in contact with this
particular shipment of poods.
Before leaving Dr. Wood looked upon
this theory as most Important as it may
unravel the mystery of the introduction
<>f the plague into Honolulu. It is most
lfkrly that the plapue was brought here
in the same shipment of merchandise
from the Orient.
The information that the plague had
broken out at Hilo reached here on the
13th. The case was that of a Portuguese
Â¦woman, the wife of A. G. Serrao. Glands
from the bofly were pent to this city. Dr.
Hoffman began an examination at once.
Temporary slides were made for the
microscope. Dr. Hoffman. Dr. Wood and
1 Â»r. Carmichael agreed that the specimen
contained the bacilli of the plague or
something very closely resembling it.
"I consider the case one of plague." raid
Dr. Wnnd. "In connection with the symp
toms of the patient prior to death I think
Jt is pronounced. Yes, the bacilli are very
.-ipparent in the slides made by Dr. Hoff
man."
Accompanying the specimens submitted
â¢was c. letter from Dr. W. L. Moore giving
the history of the case.
Consular Agent Furneaux is at present
unable to give clean bills of health to ves
?=<is departing from Hilo. After consulta
tion' with local physicians he find 3 it
necessary to qualify the documents with
the statement that there has been one
death under very suspicious circum
f-'tances. This will probably necessitate
quarantine at foreign ports.
DrÂ«. Wood and Carmichael and United
Ctatef Consul General Hay wood have gon<*
to Hilo and will stop at Kahului on their
return. Mr. Haywood goes to look after
EUgar shipments.
Disease in Merchandise.
The Board of Health has adopted the
following resolution:
"Whereas. There is reason to believe

PLAGUE SPREADS TO
THE ISLAND OF MAUI
Honolulu Considered Free From
the Disease, but a Few Cases
Have Appeared at Hilo.
HONOLULU. Feb. 15.â The health situation in this city to-day is better ,
than it has been at any time since the outbreak of the plague. Not a case '
has developed in ten days. The members of the Board of Health are conn
dent that the trouble is about over, as far as Honolulu Is concerned, but vig
ilance will not be relaxed; certain districts will be keptJn quarantine and the. .
work of cleaning the city will.be kept up. The health of Chinese and Jap
anese in the detention camps Is good, and there Is apparently no danger from
this source. Several plague patients, now In the pesthouse, are Improving. ,
Among them Is J. H. Hartxnan, a white man. Up to February 6, the date of
the last case, there have been fifty deaths from plagilo in this city.
Honolulu -in merchandise from â¢ China or
Japan; therefore, be it
"Resolved, That pending further inves
tigation Into the .matter the landing of
any merchandise from countries where
bubonic plague exists into any ports, of
the Hawaiian Islands Is prohibited."
Dr. Wood agreed with the resolution
pending further investigation. There \caÂ«
no question that plague was carried
to Kahului in freight, and not by persons;
the same applied here. The plague un
doubtedly came to Honolulu in freight.
The president agreed that the resolution
should be passed.
The first vessel to have her freight re
fused a landing was the British steamer
Strathgyle of the San Diego line.; She ar
rived on the 13th, with 323 immigrants and
about seventy tons of freight. The pas
sengers were landed and the vessel pro
ceeded on her way.
Saturday, the 17th, has been Bet apart
for "rat killing" day. Citizens will be pro
videdÂ» with poison secreted in paste in a
small bowl, on a piece of wood, in place
of meat, as first suggested. Small blocks
of wood will be used. The bowl in tho
tops of these blocks will be quite small
and the -quantity of paste enough for a
few rats only. It will take 30,000 of these
blocks to fill the bill.
At noon on the 12th Minister Mott-Smith
issued an order recalling the military from
Kalihi camp. As soon as possible the
companies will be mustered out of active
service. Extra guards supplied by Mar
shal Brown will in future take care of af
fairs at the camp.
On the 12th inst. it was reported that
Armstrong Smith, the manager of the
pesthouse. had contracted the plague. The
report, however, turned out to be untrue.
Smith contracted a fever, but is in no
danger. He will soon be on his feet again.
The merchants have subscribed $5000 for
Smith as a reward for his good work dur
ing the past two months.
Homes for Sufferers.
The Council of State has appropriated
an additional $10,000 for the completion of
camps for the Japanese and Chinese who
lost their homes In the recent large fire
in Chinatown. " :?"
The necessity of providing accommoda
tions temporarily for the people released
from quarantine has repeatedly been
urged by the papers. Now the community
is face to face with the contingency. The
finding of a half starved Chinaman in the
street yesterday was the forerunner of
what is in sight.
Arrangements have been made at Kalihl
to take the 400 people left at the kerosene
camp. It Is then proposed to thoroughly
clean the latter and open It to the home
less. Nearly 1000 souls can be provided for
comfortably there. With Honuakaha, the
drill shed and the new camp on Vineyard
6treet, about 3000 people can be housed
until they can shift for themselves.
It is stated that the laboring classes of
Chinese and Japanese are without funds.
and some provision in the matter of food
will probably have to be made for then*.
The Government expects to receive in
structions by the next mall In regard to
the Legislature. The importance of an
early session was laid before President
McKinley some time ago. Will he direct
that the session be held at the regular
constitutional time, or be postponed until
the enabling act has been passed? There
is an impression In the Cabinet that the
former will be the case.
legislative Problem.
Just how the Legislature would be as
sembled it a conundrum: Of the out-of
town members only two. Senator Nor
throp and Representative Achl of Hawaii,
are here. _ . ,-'Â»
The opinion of the Attdrney General in
regard to appropriations really makes the
Eituation serious, though not so bad as it
will be after March 31, when the appro
priations under the loan act will run out.
At present even the Customs Bureau,
Board of Health, Department of Educa
tion, Public Works Bureau and Postofflce
hardly know where they stand In several
important particulars. The Police | De
partment Is no better off. In the mean
time, or until March 1, Minister Damon
will advance his personal funds to carry
cut the work in the Postofflce and Cus
toms Bureau, relying on the Legislature
to reimburse him.
When the doctors try to finally make up
their minds about how the plague got into
Honolulu they will encounter some
strange contradictions In the evidence. It
is the general opinion that rats brought
the pest here, or at least that it came in
freipht from the Orient and was scattered
by the rodente. Much of the evidence to
be collected about the freight and the rats
is against this theory .-
All along the water front it is the uni
versal testimony that rats have disap
peared. Many n*ere found dead. At the
Pacific Mail wharf they were seen almost
in swarms up to a couple of months ago.
Now there arc none, but not a case of
plapue has occurred among the people
who worked on the wharf and handled the
freight in which the rats were.

ARRIVAL OF THE
AMERICA MARU
The steamer America Maru arrived
from the Orient late last evening.
The Maru brought fifty-two cabin pas
sengers, three European and 107 Chinese
and Japanese steerage passengers. Health
prevailed during the trip and the cabin
passengers were all landed last night at
the Pacific Mail dock. The vessel Itself
went to Angel Island, where it will re
main until to-day. On the voyage nothing
of any moment occurred.
The America Maru sailed from Hong
kong on January 27, and Honolulu was
reached on February 16. The vessel re
mained about twelve hours at the plague
port and started for this city. At Hono
lulu the passengers taken aboard were:
John Marsden. R. Moss. C. L. Ramsey,
M. Brasch. Mrs. M. Holden, J. Bostus,

Among the passengers were J. L. Spit
zer and M. Brasch. two merchants of Hon
olulu, who state that for eleven days be
fore they left there werelno new cases of
plague, and It was the general opinion
that the dread disease had been effectu
ally stamped out. A suspicious case had
developed in Hilo. that of a Portuguese
woman, but it was thought that it was
only a case of blood poisoning on super
ficial examination. The doctors, however,
had not diagnosed the case before the
steamer left.

number of months she made a living by
box rustling and singing in concert halls
attached to saloons. Her brother, Joseph
Maloney, lives at Kern, Cal. He was

Beatrice, aged 13, works for her board at
SlO Filbert street, Oakland. One eon
lives elsewhere in Oakland, another In
San Francisco, while the youngest child
is cared for at the Sisters' Home at Ana
heim.
Since Mrs. Paige's death a pitiful letter
has been received from her daughter
Beatrice, who wrote that her little
brother John had practically no clothes
to wear. She thought her mother should
send them money. Mrs. Paige did not al

the indications all point to an early con

From all that I am able to learn I see
no reason why the bill will not pass the

EPIDEMIC OF MURDER
IN YOKOHAMA, JAPAN
Native Runs Amuck, Killing Four
High Priests Worshiping at the
Shrine of Miogi.
YOKOHAMA, Japan, Feb. 7.â Since the
execution of the American murderer Mil
ler an epidemic of multiple murder seems
to have broken out among the Japanese.
The infusion of Malay blood in the natives
has given evidence of itself in a disposi
tion to run amuck. Last week a mad
man, snatching a sword from a police
box, entered the famous shrine at Miogi
and slew the chief priest with three of his
attendants. On the alarm being given the
crowd that 'came to the rescue was
fiercely attacked, and not until three other
victims had fallen before the murderer's
sword was he finally dispatched.
On Sunday evening last Yokohama was
the scene of a brutal murder, the result
of a family quarrel. Crazed by fancied
cruel treatment, one of the members slew
the entire household, consisting of the
murderer's nephew, the wife and daugh
ter of the latter and a boy servant. The
criminal then repaired to the police sta
tion and gave himself up.

Capitol to-night Is guarded by fewer sol
diers than It has been at any time slnco
the assassination of the late Governor
Goebel. Adjutant General Collier to-day,
acting under directions Jrom Governor
Taylor, summoned all soldiers before him
and told them that such of them as did
not desire to remain in the service longer
might return to their homes. About 150
went home, leaving probably 100 still here.
The weather during the greater part of
the time the soldiers have been here has
been of the most trying character, but the
percentage of Illness has not been large.
The Legislature was not in session, hav
ing adjourned on account of Washington's
birthday, and it is doubtful if either
house will have a working attendance to
morrow.

VALUABLE ADVICE
TO FRUIT RAISERS
Another Day of Lectures
at Stanford.
Epeclal Dispatch to Th* Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 22.â
"With all but the fruit-growers and those
who are working In their interest to-day
has been a holiday at Stanford. With
them it waa a day of earnest endeavor
and of practical value. Every one of the
lecturers had ideas which cannot help
but be of value to the horticulturist in
some phase of his work.
Judge S. F. LJeb of San Jose was the
first lecturer of the day, speaking upon
"The Preparation and Marketing of Cured
Fruits." He covered in detail the work
of the fruit-grower, drawing his illustra
tions from prune growing. In this regard
he said that the tree should never be
shaken. To insure cleanliness he advised
the frequent change of the lye solution.
Edward Berwick of Monterey next
spoke upon "The Nicaragua Canal."
"Every mile that you are farther from
the market than your competitor," he
said, "Is a mile to your disadvantage. If
you start In a race SOOO miles behind your
strongest rival you bid fair to be badly
worsted. The Argentine farmer has this
advantage over us here in California If
we ship our goods by water to England.
"Our competitors in wheat raising are
quite naturally the farmers of the Ar
gentine republic. Though they now pro
duce two million tons of wheat annually
this Is but one-sixth of their capacity.
Without the canal they are SOOO miles
closer to the world's market than we are."
Dr. Edward A. Ross opened the after
noon session with a lecture upon "The
Laws of Transportation." This subject
has long been his hobby and he entered
into a discussion of the fundamental
principles with a zest. He traced the
growth of transportation from its earli
est grades to the present day, showing
that technical superiority comes only
with the density of traffic.
Professor J. H. Comstock closed the
lectures with a talk on scale insects

GROWING SENTIMENT IN CONGRESS IN FAVOR OF OPEN CANAL
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1900.
CANAL BILL SURE TO
PASS THIS SESSION
Opinions of Representatives From
the Pacific Coast. Â¦
Importance of the Measure, It Is Thought,
Will Overcome Ohjectlon Due to the
Hau-Pauncefote Treats.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
PALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELL
INGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON, Feb. 22.-In spite of the fact
I that the leaders of the Republican
V^r party In both the House arid
Senate agree that the present pes
flon of Congress shall end before the date
eet for the Republican convention at
Philadelphia, the prospects for the Nica
ragua canal legislation are excellent- It
Is recognized that there Is much work
still to be done before the date of ad
journment can be, even approximately,
fixed, but there is an evident disposition
In both houses to waste no more ' time.
Tha lower house is having night sessions
on the Porto Rlcan bill and it was an
nounced in the Senate to-day that the
Alaskan bill will be debated at night ses
sions In that body.
REPRESENTATIVE LOCT> eald: "I
favor the passage of the Nicaragua^ bill
at this session aad I see no reason why
there Bhould not be time for Its considera
tion. The House can limit the debate on
any bill when the members of the ma
jority are ready to vote and there is
therefore no opportunity for a possible
campaign or filibustering against the bill.
I believe that Chairman Cannon will not
oppose the Nicaraguan bill after the ap
propriation bills are out of the way and
as the representative from the Pacific
Coast I believe the bill should pass. I
will co-operate in expediting all other
legislation so that there will be ample
time for consideration."
REPRESENTATIVE DE VRIES said:
"The only apparent Impediment to the
passage of the Nicaragua canal bill at
this session Is the present status of the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty. The strong sen
timent of the country that this should be
purely an American enterprise, under ab
solute control of the United States in
times of r>eare as well as In war. is re-
fleeted In Congress, exciting opposition to
the construction of the canal in the pres
ence of the recent treaty stipulations. The
paramount importance of the waterway
has been so much emphasized by recent
events a"Vid possibilities of future trade
that opposition upon account of the prob
able expense Involved has almost. If not
entirely, disappeared. This Is one of the
favorable Indications of an early under
taking of the project and measures to an
extent the rapidly Increasing demand for
the passage of the bill. In my Judgment
these temporary objections will soon be
overcome and the close of the present ses
sion of Congress will have witnessed the
consummation of the great project."
REPRESENTATIVE NEEDHAM. who
has been confined to his home for the past
week on account of illness, said that while
his enforced absence from the House
made It impossible for him to speak ac
curately of the present status of the bill,
hÂ© believed that there vat a strong ma
jority in favor of the canal bill and that it
would become a law at this session.
JUDGE BARHAM said: "I have talked
with Chairman Hepburn, who Is in charge
of the bill. He told me that the Commit
tee on Rules will bring In a special rule
fixing March 6 as the aate for considera
tion and that he (Hepburn) was now as
certaining from members of the Inter
state Commerce Committee, which re
ported the bill, how much time was de
sired by them for debate. The matter has
been bo thoroughly discussed by news
papers and at conventions all over the
country that he believes comparatively
little time will be asked for debating the
bill. Apparently the bill will pass the
House with very few votes against it and
unless the recent Hay-Pauncefote treaty
should hold it up in the Senate it should
be a law before Congress adjourns."
REPRESENTATIVE METCALF said
that while he had not talked with the
members of the Commerce Committee he
has conferred with many members of.
both parties in the House. He thinks that
the bill will certainly pass during the
present session. He is heartily In favor
cf building the canal provided It is built,

CLUB WOMEN ENTERTAIN.
Quite the most delightful club affair of
the season was the "gentlemen's night"
of the Forum Club last evening at Sher
man & Clay's Hall. Several hundred peo
ple were the guests of the lady members
of the popular club, and enjoyed to the
full the excellent evening's entertainment
they provided.
After an interesting programme the hall
was cleared and the guests of the evening
greeted the ladles who proved such de
lightful hostesses and partook with them
of an elaborate supper.
The musical part of the programme was
of a high order of excellence and was In
the hands of Slgnor Cadenasso and Mme.
de Seminario. .George Hammersmith had
a fifteen minutes' interview with the au
dience, who persisted in demanding more
and more of -the clever amateur's songs,
recitations and imitations.
The tableau portion of the entertain
ment was a picturesque feature. Ray
mond Dean read scenes Â¦ from the "Mer
chant of Venice," "Romeo and Juliet "
"Twelfth Night" and "The Winter's
Tale." and .while he read the curtain was
parted and the tableau appropriate to the
lines was disclosed to view. About 300
guests enjoyed the hospitality of the Fo

TRACK GAMBLING AND POOLROOMS.
rROM the tone of the proceedings before the
Police Committee of thÂ« Board of Supervisors
on Wednesday it appears the people of San
Francisco wiil have to prepare for another contest
against the gamblers of the racetrack and the pool
rooms. Ir seems clear the committee will not recom
mend the passage of an ordinance forbidding pool
telling and making it unlawful for persons to fre
quent places where pools are sold, and it is even
probable an attempt wili be made to permit the re
opening of Ir.gleside racetrack for unlimited racing
Â£nd track gambling.
In Qi-cussing the proposition to grant a license for
the reoperar.g of Ingleside track Attorney Dorn, who
appeared for the men who desire to resume racing
there, made the curious argument that the silence of
the press on the subject should be accepted as a tacit
consent to the project. The attorney has evidently
forgotten that the press of the city was well nigh
unanimous in making the fight against track gam
bling when public indignation started the crusade
that resulted in closing the downtown poolrooms and
Â£uppress:r.Â£ the evil at Ingleside racetrack. It is safe to
say that an equal agreement will be found among the
influential papers of the city to-day should a per
sistent effort be made by the gamblers to revive the
i.^ue.
The press of San Francisco has had to record too
nuinj follies and crimes resulting from track gam
bling to be indifferent upon the subject. In the for
mer controversy on the issue the press recalled to
public attention the fearful array of defalcations,
breaches of trust, thefts, robberies, divorces, assaults,
rr.urders and suicides caused by track gamblers either
Â£t Ingleside or at the downtown poolrooms, and it
v ill do so again if necessary. Certainly The Call will
not be stient on this issue, which so vitally affects the
welfare of the community, . nor indeed will the
churches and other organizations charged with the
refponfibility of promoting and sustaining public
morality.
Attorney Drum, who appeared for the proprietors
of the downtown poolrooms, stated that his clients
rre willing to pay a license for the privilege of run
ring the business. Such willingness is not surprising.
The profits of the trade are large. It is worth
s<-n:ctl!:ng to be permitted to keep open gam
h!:r!g rooms in this city and to spread the
enticements of betting before men and boys
snd even women. It is only a few days ago
that a pn:ire raid upon a suspected illicit poolroom
resulted in the discovery of twenty-seven women m
the room at the moment the police entered. More
over, they were well dressed women, representing the
average society of the city, and yet they were there
gambling away the earnings that are needed in their
The Supervisors are well aware that Attorney Dorn
and Attorney Drum were speaking for their clients
and not for the publicâ for a fee, and not for morality.
It is therefore surprising that after listening to the
specious arguments of these men in favor of pool
rooms and track gambling the committee should have
agreed to permit the two attorneys to prepare ordi
nances to be submitted to them at their next meet
ir.g. By what authority are the gamblers or their
lawyers clothed with the privilege of drafting laws
for San Francisco?
The forces which won the fight for morality in the
first instance must rally for the new contest. The
crnrr.Wers cbim that silence gives consent to their
fchemrs. Therefore the press, the pulpit and the
civic orgnrirntinns must speak out promptly and
fpeak resolutely against the wrong.
The worthy members of the House of Representa
tives appear to have discovered at last thÂ« qualifica
tion necessary to entitle one to a pension. Anybody
who smelt gunpowder during the war is fit for the

FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
It is not strange the lie should be passed over in
the Fair trial without a ruffle, for there has been so
much and such gross perjury in the affair that a lie
hardly counts even as a breach of etiquette.
I house Into silence during the entire first
act. It is a remarkable fact that not a
hand-clap was flushed until after the firs:
curtain. Later on the audience made up
tot Its introductory coolness by encoring
all the familiar ditties, without regard to
how they were rendered.
Miss Van Dresserâ who I think more
and more should be seen and not heardâ
sang the time-cheapened "O Promise Me "
the spurious gem of the opera, with no
style and a bad voice. She was encored.
The 'Tailor Song" was mangled by Mr
Dunsmure. and he was encoredâ three
times. The tinkers' chorus waa encored
of courseâ four times. I thinkâ and the
fact that it met with the greatest success
when given in dumb show indicates how
much the audience cared for the singers'
share In it.
The madrigal la the second act. which is
onÂ© of the best bits in the opera, went ex
ceedingly well, and In a subsequent quar
tet lit Dunsmure retrieved himself by
singing his subordinate muslo with a wel
come, truth and firmness of tone. Rush
worth sings as a schoolboy recites, and
the similarity would be more marked if the
boy's voice were changing. M 133 Cameron
had a wire in her throat and Helen Ber
tram was as sprightly as usual and aa
usual her voice was keen and white.
Barnabee Is funny in spots as the Sher
iff of Xottineham. which Mr. Smith ac
cents diligently on the last syllable, and
Frothingham (also accented on the last
Bvllable. I suppose) Is more than any one
else could be as Friar Tuck. Mac Donald
was not missed from the cast, although
Mr. Hawley, who substituted. Is decidedly
mediocre. He Is better than Mac Donald
however, for he has at least some good
notes in his voice.

THE YUKON MAIL SERVICE.
r~j ROM the Dawson Board of Trade there has
I been forwarded to Washington a memorial in
viting the attention of the Postmaster General
to certain ill effects resulting from existing postoffice
rules and regulations affecting the Yukon service.
One of these is the order that the mails between
Dyea and Dawson shall contain only letters and pos
tal cards, to the exclusion of all other articles. .The
other is the rule that when notice is given of mail mat
ter held for insufficient postage but two weeks' time
is allowed to the notified party to forward the amount
rcauired.
The latter issue is one about which there- can be no
differences of opinion. Two weeks is ample time for
postal remittances anywhere within reach of a rail
way, but it is manifestly absurd to enforce that rule
upon the people of Dawson. As the memorial says:
"Replies to such notice sent to Skaguay from this
place to be replied to require at least four weeks, and
from Seattle six weeks. It will therefore be seen
that this works great hardship and loss." The rea
sonable request is made that postmasters be instructed
to retain mail matter on which insufficient postage
has been paid for at least two months, so as to give
those interested an opportunity to make good the de
ficiency.
The other request is not so self-evidently just, but
nevertheless good reason is given for it. The Cana
dian Development Company has a contract for de
livering 700 pounds of mail each week. For a long
time past, so the memorial states, the average weight
of mail from "the outside" has been less than 350
pounds a week. It thus appears the weight of letters
and postal cards is not sufficient to make up the
amount the contract calls for. That being so, it
would be wise to permit other kinds of mail matter to
be forwarded. At least all on which first class post
age has been paid might be carried to make up the
weekly average of 700 pounds' weight.
The memorialists say: "We are reliably informed
that under the instructions of the department limiting
the carrying to letters only much matter on which
first class postage has been paid has been withheld
and will not be delivered until the approaching sum
mer. This works a great hardship to those depend
ing on the mails for the transportation of documents
and papers absolutely essential to the proper carrying
on of business. Many of us are also subscribers to
periodicals, which are now withheld, although first
class rates have been paid thereon."
The enforcement of the two weeks' rule for replies
to notices of deficient postage upon the people of
Dawson or any part of Alaska is red tape of the
worst kind. It would seem also to be full time for
better arrangements to be made for the whole sys
tem of mail service with the Yukon country. It is no
longer the impenetrable wilderness it was. There are
now good trails from Skaguay over the mountains
and down the river to Dawson and the principal
mining camps, with lodging places convenient for
every part of the journey. Mining in that country
has ceased to be an affair of adventure only. It is
now an established industry, and Dawson has become
a center of no inconsiderable business. It is time,
therefore, the rules made during the rush of 1897
should be abrogated and a better service provided.
As a meeting of the committee charged with pro
moting the establishment of a commercial museum
resulted in an attendance too small to constitute a
quorum, it is evident the enthusiasm in the movement
of some of the members evaporated in talk and left
none for action.
"BUT KEN HE TRINK DER SHOP OUD?"
âNew York World.
FORESTS AND FLOODS.
THIS country is still a long way from a proper
system of forestry, which will preserve the tim
ber tracts that have escaped ax and fire and
make their product a permanent source of wealth, di
rectly through proper harvesting for economic use,
and indirectly through the effect of permanent forest
upon climate and moisture. It is cheering, however,
that a start toward such a system is being made by
collecting the physical facts which demonstrate its
necessity. There has been much opposition to for
estry because to the uninformed it has seemed to be
an organized opposition to the use of timber and an
attempt to preserve the forests for scenic purposes, or
for purely sentimental reasons. Knowledge to cor
rect this is being gradually spread abroad and lum
bermen are learning that they may so treat timber
tracts as to make their crop permanent, to be har
vested from time to time, with reproduction uninter
rupted. In this way they are beginning to see their
business may be permanent and the land kept amply
covered with forest as a protection of moisture and to
conserve the flow of streams.
The Agricultural Department is about to enter
upon an investigation of the relation of forest to the
run-off of watercourses. The Division of Forestry
has chosen for that purpose the watershed of the
Mohave River, in this State, which has its water
shed in the San Bernardino Mountains. That water
shed exhibits three distinct characteristics. Part of
it is a brush-covered district, part has been deforested
and made bare and blear by lumbering, and part is
still covered by "primeval forest. The soil is uniform,
and the rainfall over all is practically the same. It
is expected that this investigation will prove that the
flood extreme of a watercourse is in proportion to
the lack of forest covering.
It will be seen that the rainfall on a watershed being
known, and acclivity ascertained, and the run-off of
the stream measured, the effect of vegetable covering
of the soil upon the flow of the water to the channel
of the stream is demonstrated. When one watershed
has been investigated, the data secured is ready for

State is known, and the run-off through streams is
measured, we may get at the volume of storm water
that may be stored and can then estimate the duty it
can do on lands that need irrigation.
For these reasons the work of the Agricultural De-
application to like areas and conditions. The infor
mation to be obtained has a variety of useful applica
tions. It illuminates the subject of forest preservation
and is instructive in the steps toward a proper ad
ministration of forest land. It exposes also the waste
of water that follows the destruction of forests, raus
ing the streams to become muddy torrents, carrying
away the water and the fertile surface of the soil nt
the same time. When the forest cover is maintained
the rainfall is conserved and delivered slowly to the
drainage channels, and these do not alternate between
excessive floods and entire dryness. When the rain
fall runs off by reason of excessive saturation of the
forest soil it appears in the streams as storm water,
carrying with it but little silt, because the vegetable
cover protects the soil surface from wash, and such
water may he stored for irrigation and to reinforce
the normal flow of the stream in the dry season.
DE KOVEN' S OPERA
STILL ENJOYABLE
,It !Â» not Improbable that the encyclo
pedias a century hence will contain tho
name of Reginald de Koven, composer of
"Robin Hood," though such a distinction
will hardly be accorded to Harry B.
Smith, the book-maker, nor to Victor
Herbert. Jinglesmith. De Koven has cer
tainly succeeded in producing one epoch
making opera, and whether, as it la al
leged, he bought his tunes from im
pecunious musicians or not. It really makes
no difference to any one but the record-
Ing angel.
He may be a plagiarist and deserving of
appropriate condemnation, but he has all
the credit for "Robin Hood," and that Is
a grreat deal in Itself. Herbert is perhan*

PROTESTS AGAINST TARIFF CHANGES
A GRATIFYING feature of the contest against
the proposed reciprocity treaties is the part
taken in it by certain important manufacturing
associations in the East. It appeared for a time as if
California would have no other aid in defending her
industries than that given by the beet sugar producing
States, but now there is a prospect that all who be
lieve in the principle of protection will unite in
opposing the ill devised reciprocity arrangements.
A large manufacturing company of New York has
protested against the treaties on the ground that "the
I-recedent which would be established by their con
firmation would be a standing menace to all manufac
turing industries." The protest further declares:
"By making tariff rates a matter of bargain between
countries such a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity
would be aroused that no conservative' manufacturer
would dare invest capital in enterprises which might
be ruined by reciprocity treaties."
Representatives of Philadelphia manufacturers as
sert that if the treaty with France be carried out "the
harm that would be inflicted on many industries, but
especially upon the manufacturing of braids and trim
mings, would be far-reaching." From firms engaged
in the jewelry industry in New England there has
been sent to the Senators from that section a protest
declaring that a ratification of the French treaty
would be disastrous to the 50,000 people who are now
dependent for support upon that industry; they there
fore appeal to those Senators to use their utmost en
deavors to have the treaty rejected.
It is clear the manufacturers of the East begin to
see the full' extent of the danger ahead. Their inter
ests will suffer as well as those of the people of Cali
fornia, and, moreover, they perceive that if we once
set about breaking down the protection given to
American industry by the tariff, there is no telling
where the process will stop. After a reciprocity treaty
with France there will be demanded one with Ger
many, with Italy and with Russia. The whole sys
tem will be. disordered, and the industries' of the
country thrown into confusion. This is one of the
cases where it is best to let well enough alone! Let
us not tinker with a tariff that is satisfactory as it
stands. :v .

FIGHTING BOB
APPEARS AS A
FIGUREHEAD
He Adorns the Ship
General Roberts.
WAS INJURED IN A HURRICANE
General Roberts, commander In chief of
the British forces in South Africa, has
visited nearly every port of any size on
the face of the globe as the figurehead of
the British ship General Roberts, which
arrived from Newcastle, N. 3. W., last
Wednesday. When the vessel was ready
for launching the warrior's famous march
to Kandahar was the one topic of conver
sation in England, so a figurehead of the
general as he then appeared was put on
the ship and she was christened "Gen
eral Roberta."
Since that time the figurehead has been
In all kinds of weather, and had Its name
sake been there the famous general would
have come to the conclusion that the bat
tles with the elements were sometimes as
hard as encounters with the Afghans and
Boers. When the General Rooerts left
England two years ago the figurehead was
beautiful in its new coat ot paint. The
ship came here and after discharging went
to Puget Sound and loaded lumber for
Cape Town. On arriving there the war
had Just begun, and the General Roberts
cleared for Australia in ballast. On the
way a terrific storm was encountered and
both the general's arms were washed off.
From Australia the General Roberts came
here and the figurehead is still minus the
arms. The vessel loads here for Liver
pool, and on her arrival there the General
will be rehabilitated. Should he have de
feated the Boers by that time the owners
of the vessel will probably put on a new
figurehead showing the hero of the South
African campaign without his side whisk
ers. .
Captain T. C. Fearon. master of the
General Roberts, Is a great admirer of the
"Pocket Wellington and arder" (a half),

COLONIAL TARIFFS.
THE "Examiner is greatly excited over the propo
sition to put a tariff barrier between American la
bor and tropical cheap wages. It is worth whileto
note the history of the Examiner as an expansionist.
It first announced the doctrine that Congress was not
bound by the constitution in making a form of gov
ernment for the tropical islands, but could rule tthem
as it pleased. Next it demanded that we hold Porto
Rico and "nail the flag to the Philippines."
Now it is appalled because Republicans propose to
govern these islands according to its theory and is
frantic for free trade between them and the United
States. This is understood to be the Democratic pro
gramme, which changes with every month.
If this programme of the Examiner be carried out
and the Republican plan for governing the various
places to which the Examiner desired the flag to be
nailed is defeated it means the displacement of Amer
ican labor by cheap tropical and coolie slave labor.
We welcome the issue. The Call opposed the vari
ous flag-nailing propositions and it now opposes the
Democratic sequence which reopens the coolie labor
question and inflicts damage irreparable upon Ameri
can labor.
We insist that the Republican doctrine of protec
tion shall be maintained. .The party has never been
unmindful of the interests of American labor. Since
its organization the wage schedule and the standard
of life for that labor have risen and advanced steadily
and uniformly. We desire no assault upon that con
dition of things and propose to defend the American
system against all comers.
The plan of the Examiner and its party not only
opens all our ports to the free influx of the products of
cheap labor, but brings the coolie slave here, bodily,
to take from American labor the little bread that will
be left after the products are displaced. The risk is
great, the crisis imminent, the call to duty is plain and
unmistakable. The rights of American labor are chal
lenged by the Examiner and we stand for them, now
and always.
The chief objection to free trade with Porto Rico
is the Democratic intention to use it as a precedent
and an entering wedge to influence a like policy for
the Philippines. We know of no profit that can arise
from such a policy that will offset the degradation of
American wage-earners. If the flag-nailing organ
know of any it would better cease its appeals to
prejudice and its purulent partisanship, and say what
that offset is.
The Republican party should take immediate warn
ing. It should refuse to swerve a hair's breadth from
the policy that has caused its return to power after
the reverses of iSoo and 1592.
Above all, it should refuse to accept the advice or
follow the policy of an enemy that is willing that Re
publicanism and the welfare of American labor shall
be whelmed in a common ruin for the sake of making
Mr. Bryan President, and turning the country over
to Tillman and Altgeld. All Republicans, no matter
what their views on expansion, must see the need of
standing together against the success of a policy
which proposes to raise the gates and let in upon our
kbor a flood of coolie slave labor or its products.
The theory of non-constitutional government of our
new possessions is strictly Democratic. It was orig
inated to influence the country in favor of expansion.
Let its authors be compelled to abide by it, especially
when the American wage scale is at stake and the
American standard of life is threatened.

IROQUOIS BRAVES FEAST.
The Iroquois Club gave its sixteenth an
nual banquet last night at the Occidental
Hotel as a fitting conclusion to the con
vention during the day. The feast, like
those of the past, was a success in every
detail, and 200 guests, Including the dele
gates from Interior counties, were delight
fully entertained with an elaborate menu.
When the black coffee was distributed,
the speech-making began with an address
of welcome by William McMann, who
of Independence and especially to that funda
mental principle "That governments derive
their Just powers from the consent of the gov
erned." We believe this doctrine to be as cor
rect in principle to-day as it was one hundred
and twenty-flve years ago, when penned by
Jefferson, and to establish and maintain which
the signers of the Declaration of Independence
pledged "their lives, their fortunes and their
sacred honor." We believe this principleâ the
right to govern themselves in their own way
should continue to apply, not alone to the peo
ple of the United States, but to the people of
every land all over the world who have the
courage and manhood to battle for human lib
erty.
Resolved, That to deny to the ten million
people who reside In the Philippine Islands
the right to establish and maintain Buch a
government as to them seems best suited for
their own protection and future advancement,
or to attempt to establish and maintain by force
and military usurpation a government in these
islands against the will of the people, is a vio
lation of the fundamental principles upon
which our own Government was established
and a dangerous menace to the principles of
human liberty, not only here, but throughout
the world.
Resolved, That wo heartily condemn the at
titude assumed by the administration In its
proposed agreement with other nations relative
to the Nicaragua canal, by which this country
surrenders many advantages that should be
ours from the bulldinr of such canal. The
United States proposes to construct said canal
at a coat of millions of dollars and then retain
no control over it, allowing. In time of war,
the warships of an enemy the same rights and
privilege* In and upon the canal as enjoyed
by ourselves. We condemn this action in sur
rendering to England and other countries privi
leges which they have no right to ask ami
which may be granted to our own ultimate
undoing, and are therefore unalterably opposed
to -the Hay-Pauncefote treaty.
ReÃOlved, That as all governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed
wÂ» are unalterably opposed to imperialism in
all forms and to any permanent form of gov
ernment for the newly acquired possessions of
the United BtateÃ which will' have the effect
of transferring the governing .power of such
possessions from the. inhabitants thereof to the
Government at Washington: and we are fur
ther opposed to any discrimination in the way
of tariff charges against those countries, and
believe that so long as they continue a part
of thp territory of the United States their in
habitants should have all the rights and privi
leges accorded by law to the citizens of the
territorial possessions of our country.
Resolved, That we most strenuously oppose
all criminal and oppressive monopolistic com
binations and trusts whoso tendency is to de
stroy competition and foster combination by
raising the â¢ price of all articles consumed by
the people and reducing the price of all com
modities produced by the people, and that we
favor such legislation as will effectively de
stroy all such oppressive and Illegitimate com
bines.
We condemn the Republican party as being
the creator and protector of trusts and the
enejny of the great common people and believe
that one of the surest ways to consummate the
downfall of the trusts Is to defeat the Repub
lican party, which Is owned and controlled by
the money power, the greatest of all trust*.
Resolved. That we reaffirm and fully lndors*
the national Democratic platform as adopted
at Chicago In 189Â« in its entirety, and that
we recornlze as a champion of the people in
th<Mr combat against trusts. Imperialism and
the moneyed powers that tried, able and in
trepid leader. William Jennings Bryan, and In
dorse him as the leader of the Democracy in
1S0O. : Â¦'-'Â¦. "Â¦?'
Resolved, That we express our heartfelt sym
pathy with the two little republics in South
Africaâ the Boers of the veldtâ who are fight
ins to maintain the right of eelf-government
and the principle* of liberty against such over
whelming odd*. So far they have astonished
the world by the skill, bravery and courage
with which they have not only resisted but
repeatedly defeated their foes, who on most
occasions outnumbered them three to one. We
hope and constantly pray for their continued

CHICAGO PLATFORM OF 1896
AND BRYAN INDORSED.
The Bryan Democrats of California,
through the agency of tho State League
of Iroquois Clubs, opened the political
campaign of the season yesterday at
Pythian Castle. Resolutions were adopt
ed extolling Bryan and indorsing the Chi
cago platform of 1396. There was a good
attendance of braves from the interior.
Among the city delegates there were sev
eral office-holders and many more who
hope to hold office. Of the office-holding
guild Joseph Gorman, secretary of the
Fire Commission^ and Frank Gould,
Building and Loan Commissioner, were
eloquent in their denunciation of trusts
and combinations.
The annual conference was called to
order by Grand Sachem George H. Ca
baniss. During lulls In the storm of ora
tory some business was transacted. For
example, committees on credentials and
resolutions were appointed.
Among the braves from the interior in
attendance were Fred C. Law, J. C. Rud
dock and J. B. Sanford of Mendocino
County; Judge M. Johnson. J. W. Hughes,
E. W. Woodman, Charles T. Hughes,
Lewis Green, Louis Vogel and P. A.
Byrne of Sacramento County; J. D. Bren
nan, Lawrence McGulre, T. E. Murphy
and D. Corrlgan of Contra Costa; George
Roe, Solano; ex-Senator D. A. Ostrom,
Yuba: Judge W. M. Gibson, Santa Clara,
Grand Sachem Cabaniss in calling the
convention to order said that never be
fore had so many momentous questions
affecting the foreign policy of the nation
confronted the people of the United
States. He referred to the Philippine
problem and the Nicaragua canal, the lat
ter the most stupendous enterprise ever
undertaken. Such grave matters called
for careful consideration and a thorough
organization by the Democratic party for
the campaign soon to open.
A committee on resolutions was ap
pointed, consisting of Charles Gildea,
Charles Edelman. Judge Johnson, \V. -M.
Gibson, A. A. Bailey, T. J. Crowley. Hugo
Hornlein, Hull McClaughrey, J, B. San
ford and \V. B. Cannon. Subsequently
the committee reported the. following res
olutions, which were unanimously adopt
ed as the battle-cry of the assembled
braves:
Resolved, by the members of the State Leagua
of Iroquois Clubs, That on thla anniversary
of the birth of George Washington we pro

MORE REPAIRS TO BE
MADE ON THE MISSOURI
B.EPOBT OF THE OFFICEBS OF
THE BOABD OF STJRVET.
Vessel Has Cost Over Half a Million
and May Cost Another Hun
dred Thousand.
The board of survey which has beÂ«n in
specting the hospital ship Missouri has
made its report. It has found that the
vessel requires "only such repairs as are
to be expected" en a vessel coming in
from a long trip at sea, but these repairs
rr.ay entail an expense close to $100,000
and a delay of frora five to six. weeks.
Despite this report all does not seem
right -with the Missouri. On her trip here
ehe started from Manila with 252 sick. To
care for these there were five surgeons,
seven hospital stewards, fifty privates
cf the hospital corps and ten contract
nurses, a force well abl* to cape for
double the number of patients, but in '
spite of this fact nineteen patients died
on the way over and three more died i
while the ship was in the harbor. Whether ;
this was due to the motion of the vessel Â¦
or her cond'.ti'tn has not been proved; it
la certain it was not for lack of care and :
6ttÂ«*ntinn. yÂ»*t the deaths among the men I
who were sent from the Missouri to the !
general hospital at the Presidio have been j
very few.
As to the repairs necessary it is difficult
to see how there should be much to be j
done. The vessel was purchased, presum- ;
ah!y in good condition, a little over a i
year ago. She was first fitted up by the ,
line that owned her and was assigned to !
the use cf the Government free. She was ;
runlng under th<se circumstances for I
three or four months and then the Gov
ernment bought her. She had been well
!:tted up ar.d was considered a first-class j
ship, yet the first thing the Government i
did was to spend $450,000 in refitting her. j
Her purchase price was $250,000. All this
money has been spent upon her within
two years and now there is more coming.
The only probable result of the survey,
however, seems to be- another bill for re
pairs and a reprimand for her captain and
her commanding medical officer for talk-
Ing too much and being too free with
their criticisms. The complaints made
against the vessel were that while she
had been fitted up to make a fine hospi
tal ehe had been so altered as to spoil
her as a sea-going ship.

INTERESTS of vital moment to the
Republican party of California are
now at stake, and events of the last
few days show that these interests
are in danger of being jeopardized or
injured to a degree past recovery. The
Republican party has Just passed through
a campaign at Sacramento in which it
demonstrated to the people of the Slate
that it can rise superior to the dictate of
unwelcome bosses or the commands of the
Southern Pacific Company. The legisla
tive representatives of the party have
been true to a high trust and have st-nt
to the United States Senate a man worthy
of the honor and free from boss or rail
road entanglements. The election of this
man was a proof of wholesome politics,
a pledge of honesty and decency in public
life, a plea for the support and encour
agement of the honest citizens of Cali
fornia, irrespective of their political af
filiations.
With this splendid incident of a worthy
purpose the Republican party enters the
national campaign which will end on No
vember C with the election of a President
and a Vice President of the United States.
And at the very threshold of the cam
paign the party is threatened by the dis
aster of dishonest, dirty politics and the
participation nnd absolute control of men
who were whipped out at Sacramento In
i disgrace from the party councils.
Burns Boasts of His Power.
Dan Burns left this city a few days ago
for Mexico. Before he left he told some
of those who sacrifice their self-respect in
their political friendship for him that he
had made ironclad arrangements to keep
the Republican State Central Committee
absolutely inactive until he returned in
April, when he would permit the commit
tee to meet and prepare for. the national
: campaign. The outrageous audacity of
this announcement is almost beyond be
lief, but it was made, and Burns expects
that it was the avowal of a condition that
will not be disturbed until he gives the
word. He has dared to say and to plan
that the national Interests of the Repub
lican party in this State shall remain
neglected and abused, that Republican
success In California shall be jeopardized
and the State sold to the Democracy un
less he dictates what these interests shall
be and how they shall be subserved.
The matter is of vital interest to Repub
licans throughout the State. The issue
must be determined, and determined at
once, by the State Central Committee.
This committee is or is not the property
of the Mexican political outlaw and of
William F. Herrin, Democratic head of
the law department of the Southern Pa
cific Company. There is an immediate de
mand for this committee to meet and di
rect the policy of the national campaign
in this State at once or risk the disaster
of having California enrolled In the Demo
cratic column.
Facts Easily Proved.
The facts In the matter are capable of
proof. When Burns departed for Mexico
one of the men who accompanied him
to the boat had been one of the Mexi
can's leaders in the State Legislature. To
this man Burns announced that the State
Central Committee of the Republican
party would not be permitted to meet un
til he returned from Mexico In April. In
answer to a suggestion, he said he did
not care how necessary it might be for
the committee to meet to make sugges
tions or recommendations to county com
mittees or Congressional committees be
fore his return. He was determined, he
declared, to show that his defeat at Sac
ramento had not destroyed his influence
in the party which had repudiated him In
disgust.
"Yes," added his friend, "but can you
do this? Do you possess influence enough
to tie the committee down to Inaction
when the necessity for immediate action
is apparent everywhere; when the party
must commence the tremendous work of
the national campaign under the direc- i
tion of the supreme power in the State,
the State Central Committee?"
"I can do what I please," was the reply
of Burns. "Those members of the Repub
lican State Central Committee that I do
not own are owned by William F. Herrin
of the Southern Pacific Company, and he
has promised me In accord with an agree-
ment which I have made with him that
the State Central Committee shall not be
called together In my absence. Herrin
has guaranteed to me that he will not
allow the committee to meet until I get
luck ana dictate what shall be done."
Herrin in Control.
With this astounding display of arro
gance. Burns left for Mexico, and Herrln
is now endowed with authority to pre
vent the State Central Committee from
holding a session until the Mexican re
turns. There has hardly been an emerg
ency of such serious importance in the
history of the Republican party in this
State. At the beginning of a national
campaign, which may affect the interests
of Republicanism In the nation, the ma
chinery of the party in this State is para
lyzed by command of -a man who has been
kicked out of the organization because
he represents everything disreputable, dis
honest and disgraceful in public and po
litical life.
This man claims the ownership of cer
tain members of the Republican State
Central Committee and assigns those he
does not own to the proprietorship of Wil
liam F. Herriri.
Are the members of the Republican
State Central Committee willing to sign
and indorse the bill of sale? Are they
ready to obey the command of William
F. Herrin and of the Mexican to remain
Idle, and criminally neglectful of the in
terests of their party? Are they going to
remain in shameful submission to a man
who claims thorn as his personal prop
erty? Do they intend to permit the na
tional campaign to suffer until Dan Burns
returns from that Mexican mine of his
and gives them the right to act?
Up to McLaughlin.
The Call does not believe that they will
do so. They cannot In justice to their
own manhood or to the great party they
represent permit defeat to be written on
their banners. They cannot sacrifice and
discredit the splendid victory won at Sac
ramento. Will Major McLaughlin, chair
man of the Republican State Central
Committee, refuse to call the committee
into session when the moral force of its
activity Is so necessary now for Republi
can success in this State? Major Mc-
Laughlin has been insulted and humiliated
by Herrin and by Burns. Both of these
worthies have taken pains publicly to de
ride McLaughlin and sneer at his place
and his pretensions In the party councils.
Will McLaughlin stamp their sneers and
derision with approval by obeying the
command which has gone forth?
The Call thinks not, but if Major Me-
Laughlin has been rightly judged by Her
rin and by Burns then the members of
the Republican State Central Committee
should insist upon the meeting which is
so necessary at this time. They have the
power to do so, and unless they wish the
responsibility of a poorly managed cam
paign to rest upon their shoulders and
are willing to accept the odium of pos
sible defeat they should call the meeting
without delay.
Much Work to 80.
There is much to do and time is already
pressing. The executive committee of the
County Committee of San San Francisco
is already in the Held. Communication
must be had by the State Central Com
mittee with the county and Congressional
committees throughout the State. Pri
maries must be. held, delegates must be
elected to a State convention, and these
In turn must elect delegates to the na
tional convention, which meets on .Tues
day, June 19, at Philadelphia.
Under the rule of the National Com
mittee these delegates to the national
convention must be elected at least thirty
days before the national convention is
called to order. Notice of at least thirty
days must be given before the State dele
gates are elected. Two months, there
fore, by the closest calculation, must be
provided for absolutely, without a
thought of the necessary preparatory
work of the campaign. Some idea of the
outrage involved in the command of
Burns may thus be gained. The Mexican
is deliberately sacrificing the party which
he does not represent and he is using the
State Central Committee as his club of
destruction. The Issue is one of the great
est moment. The Republican State Cen
tral Committee must act or be branded as
the property of William F. Herrin and
Dan Burns.

EDWARD PROBERT, the well-known capitalist and mining man, com
mitted suicide yesterday morinj by shooting himself through the brain
with a revolver! The lnrosxls of age and two strokes of paralysis had
affected his mind to such a degree that be was not responsible for the
act thÃt terminated his life.
The deceased lived with his wife in their residence at 940 Grovo
rtreÂ«t *vcr since it was built for them, about five years ago.
3>aFt year he was stricken with paralysis and since that time his health
appeared to be falMrg. and recently he has been a victim of insomnia. It waa
his hab!t to arise between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning and walk around the
boas* from room tÂ» room until he had quieted his nerves sufficiently to go to
bed again. Yesterday morning a little after 3 o'clock his wife, occupying an
adjoining room to the one In which he slept, heard him get up and go into tho
etric She thought that he had gone for the purpose of shutting down the
wir.dows. \chsch were usually kept open at night, and she called to him that
rbe trould shut them for him. but he made no answer. Â«
A fc-rr taoments later she heard the report of a firearm, and hastened up
stairs and found her husband lying oa the floor with the blood oozing from a
bullet wound In the right temple.
"It's all over now; I'm going," l.c said, and then became unconscious. The
distracted -wife summoned John and Kalpn Brennan of 931 Grove street, and
one of them called Dr. Lee O. Rodgers, but the wound was mortal and Mr.
Probert died !n about an hour and a half after shooting himself.
The deceased capitalist had an eventful and honorable history. He was a
rrrcduate of Cambridge University, England, and was a thorough classical
F'/iiolar. At one time he. was chaplain to the Duke of Northumberland. Mr.
I'robert caice to this State about twenty-five years ago and engaged In min
ing enterprises. He was superintendent of the Albion and Richmond mines In
Eureka. Nev. Up to the time of his death he continued as manager of the lat
ter mine. He bought the Venetia mine In Trinity County for $60,000 some yeara
ago. and discovered when too lat<9 that It had been salted.
The dead capitalist was a native of Wales and was 76 years old. Mrs. Pro
bert before her marriage taught school In Mills Seminar}', and Is twenty-flvo
years younger than her husband. Â«
The sick In the hospitals were often visited by the deceased and given
flowers and books. He vis a great bookworm, and of recent years had se
cluded himself from society for comiriunlon with the printed thoughts of great
men who d!ed long ago.

FAMOUS CAREER
General McNulta Goes
to His Rest.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 22â General John

out the West because of his Identifica
tion with the receivership of railroads and
other great corporations, died suddenly
here shortly after 6 o'clock to-night.
Death occurred in his apartments at the
Hamilton House, a:id was due to angina
pectoris. General McNulta was aged
about CO years.
He had beon apparently In the best of
health during the day and had returned
to the hotel only a short time before he
was stricken. Medical aid was hastily
summoned, but It was evident to the phy
sician that his case was a hopeless one
and he died within an hour after the at
tack.

who for a long time was associated with
Mr. McNulta in the practice of law at
Bloomlngton. 111.; Major Nally of the
army, a guest at the house, and a physi
cian were with him when death came.
The deceased leaves a widow and two
children in Chicago, a son in Montana and
another son who is a lieutenant In the
regular army in the Philippines.
Because of the great success he had at
tained in managing the affairs, of the va
rious organizations to which he was ap
pointed. General McNulta became known
as the "great American receiver." He
waa at various times receiver of the Wa
bash Railroad, the Clover Leaf road and
for the whisky trust, and at the time of
his death was acting In a similar capadtv
for the National Bank of Illinois, which
failed several years ago. He had been in

at onÂ© time a member of Congress and
waa a lawyer of distinguished ability. He
waa a close friend of General Grant and

THEODORE KIEFER had so great love for his dear old mother that hÂ©
could not endure his loss of her and within a month of the time she
died he poisoned himself, hoping to meet her In the dark beyond, and
his life went out with the word "mother" trembling on his lips.
Kiefer was found at 9 o'clock yesterday morning moaning and
writhing with pain In his room at 9^ Oak Grovo avenue. James J. Mc-
Keown a lodger, and Mrs. Addle Lyons, the landlady, heard his groans and
went Into his room to Inquire what was the matter. They found him writh
ing on thÂ© bed and now and then a moan came from his foam-flecked lips.
"What Is the matter with you?" asked McKeown. "Have you been
drinking?"
"No," replied Kiefer. "Go and bring my sister here.
Then he writhed in a severe convulsion and as his lips moved Mr. Mc-
Keown bent down to hear what he was trying to say. He caught the word
"mother," then a gasp and Kiefer lay dead, his glazing eyes staring at the
ceiling
A water tumbler at the bottom of which were whitish crystals partly dis
solved stood on a small table In the room. Kiefer had taken off his hat and
coat, dissolved nearly an eighth of an ounce of strychnine In the glass of
water and swallowed the contents. When the Morgue deputies searched his
clothing they found the vial containing a small quantity of crystals of
strychnine. . . . . . .
Kiefer was 43 years old. a native of New Orleans and a barber by trade.
Up to a month ago he lived with his mother and Mrs. Henry Ives, his
Bister, at 1913 Harrison street. When the undertaker placed his mother s
body In the coffin Kiefer took the unconscious clay In his arms and bore it
from the room. He was demented in his sorrow and It was only by means
of coaxing and some little force that the body was taken away from him
and put into thÂ© coffin. After the funeral he visited his mother's grave
every day and rrew more and more despondent, until finally his reason gave
way and he was Impelled to die the suicide's death.

Bpoclal Dispatch to Th* Call.
SAUSAX.ITO, Feb. 22.â The ray of hope
cherished as to the fate of Joseph Fer
nandez, Vincent Machado and Sydney SII
vey, the boys drowned In Lake Bonlta on
Saturday, was dispelled at 7 o'clock this
morning when thÂ© search party which has
been dragging thÂ© lakÂ© for thÂ© last four
days brought to the surface the body of
the former. The discovery of Fernandez's
remains was followed shortly after by
that of Sllvey's and Machado's.
All last night grappling irons raked the
bod of the lakÂ© In the endeavor to locate
the bodies. The search party was under
the direction of R. D. Noble. John Suea
vllla, Clinton Mason and Fred Cohen, and
was composed of over fifty men and boys.
After the bank of the lagoon had been cut
and the water lowered about five feet,
the irons encountered the body of Fernan
dez near the south end of the lake. The
others lay within a few feet of Fernan
dez. The shotguns used by the unfortun
ate boys were also brought to the surface,
being found close to the bodies of their
late owners.
A messenger was dispatched to Sausa
llto with the news of the discovery, and
Coroner Eden of San Rafael held an in
quest in the Town Hall this afternoon.
Dr. Mays heJd an autopsy and stated that
no marks of violence were visible and that
death was due to drowning. The Jury re
turned a verdict accordingly. The bodies
of Fernandez and Machado will be burled
in Sausallto to-morrow, eight of their late
schoolmates acting as pallbearers. John
Ferguson, the stepfather of Silvey, had
the boy's remains conveyed to San Fran
cisco, where they will be burled.
As a token of respect the school desks
formerly occupied by the boys will
be draped in mourning and the school
will remain closed until the funerals arÂ©
over.

The simplest form of photographic lens
is a single convex lens. A convex lens
will cause the rays of light coming from
an object or group of objects to converge
until at a fixed distance they form a
sharp, clear image. This distance is called
the focal length of the lens, and Is greater
or less according to the curvature of the
surfaces of the lens, being shorter in a
lens having strong curves and longer
when the curves are weak. If we were

NEW NATIVE SONS' PARLOR.
The organization of a parlor of Native
Sons of the Golden "West, to be composed
of former members of the First California
Volunteers, is now an assured fact, as
was demonstrated at an enthusiastic meet
ing Wednesday night at Native Sons' Hall.
Over fifty prospective members of the new
parlor were present when Grand Organ
izer John A. Steinbach called the meeting
to order. Mr. Steinbach announced that
it v/ould be necessary to secure the sig
natures of 100 applicants to obtain the re
quired charter, and Temporary Secretary
P. L. Badt stated that ninety-four ex
volunteers had signified their intention
to Join the order. H. F. McGurren one
of the committee on organization who
was absent, had a list of forty more
An informal discussion was had as to
a proper name for the new parlor and
"Manna." "Philippine," "Army ' and
Navy" and others were suggested "Army
and Navy" sjeemed to meet with the most
favor. It was the sense of the raeetimr
that the members should include reiru
lars as well as volunteers who had en
listed for service in the late war but
if any such are now members of any n a r
lor they will not be permitted to trans

Dunphy, who was with Dewey's fleet and

prisms with their bases or their edges
together, as the case may be. If the bases
are placed together rays of light passing
through each prism would cross at some
formed by such a single lens It would be
round that while the circular image is
quite large, only a small portion in the
ce i n o cr woul d appear sharply denneil.
while an ever-increasing amount of dis
tortion would appear from the center out
ward. W hile no photographic lens haa
ever yet been made which would give ab
solute sharpness over its entire image cir
cle the modern anastigmata designed by
Professor Abbe of Jena very nearly do so.
It will thus be seen that one of the most
valuable features of a lens is the ability
to produce a sharp, non-distorted imasjo
over the whole image circle, and the tnora
nearly a lens will do this the more valu
able It Is. Coupled with "covering power."
as It Is called, there should be rapidity.
The speed of a lens depends upon tha
number of rays of light which It will con
verge upon a given area. LJght proceed*
from every luminous object, equally In all
directions, hence all lenses having th*
same diameter will receive an equal
amount of light. It i.i the manner in
wbich the lens converges the light which
determines the speed. The photographic*
plate is affected more or less quickly us
the light which falls, upon it ?3 more or
less Intense. The Intensity of light varlea
Inversely with the square of the distance
from Its source. For practical purposes
wo may consider the source of light fall-
Ing upon the photographic plate to be %t
the lens. Then, supposing two lensea of
the same diameter and having the tame
size image circles to differ in focal length,
by one-half, according to the law of in
tensity the image formed by the lena hav
ing the shorter focus will be four times
as bright as the other, the illumination
will be four times as Intense and the lena
will secure a. picture in one-fourth tha
time required by the other.
For rapid photography, and this Includes
the greater part of amateur photography,
it is obvious that the lens should have tha
shortest possible focus and at the same
time bo able to produce a perfectly sharp
image over the whole plate. The difficul
ties of the optician begin when he at
tempts to combine these desirable fea
tures.
To return to our single convex lensi, a
portion of Its Indistinctness can bÂ« dono
away with by placing an opaque stop,
with a small circular opening In It, in
front of the lens. The smaller the open-
Ing the larger the area of sharpness will
be. at the same time the volume of light
will be correspondingly reduced and the
lens made slower. The practical solution
Is the use of a stop of moderate size anl
a lens having an Image circle much larger
than the diagonal of the plate of the cam
era, thus allowing the indistinct portion
of the Image circle to fall outside the lim
its of the picture to be used. Under these
immutable conditions It will be seen that
only a lens of very limited speed can bo
had when the double convex form Is em
ployed. This Is the cheapest form of lena
made. The simple meniscus lena Is an Im
provement on the double convex form,
which it resembles, with the exceptioa
that the surface toward tho object 1*
curved Inward Instead of outward. This
Increases the area of sharpness In tho
Image circle and permits the use of a lena
at shorter focus and greater aperture.
The rays of light which fall upon the
portions of a lena farthest from the cen
ter and at the most oblique angles are th^
ones which are most acted upon by tha
lens, and which, unless some special pro
vision is made for them in the construc
tion of the lens, cause Indistinctness in
the image and make it necessary to shut
them out by means of stops; therefore tha
lens which can bring the greatest number
of these marginal rays to aid in the for
mation of a sharp image will be the most
rapid and give the least distorted Image
The next step in this process is the em
ployment of two lenses of different shapa
cemented together to form one lens. One
lens Is of crown glass with comparative
ly low refracting power and the other of
flint glass of great refractive action. Tha
resulting lens Is called an achromatic len*.
and is superior to either the double con
vex or meniscus, as Its image circle has m
larger sharply denned area and a much
shorter focus may be employed on the
same plate, thus giving greater speed.
These single achromatic lenses are alsn
made double convex and meniscus, of
which the meniscus is tho better. Havin<r
proceeded so far. It Is easy to see that
still further results can be obtained by
the proper combination of two achromatic
FIGURE 7.
lenses, constructed for the purpose. Into
one compound lens. The simplest form
Is that known as "rectilinear." In which
two meniscus achromatic lenses called
"systems" are mounted In a tube with
their concave surfaces facing each other.
The rectilinear len3 Is vastly superior
to the single lens, excelling In all the pro
perties which we have mentioned In con
nection with lenses. If all objects couM
be photographed at a distance of 100 feet
or more from the camera, single lenses
might do quite well, but when It is de
sired to make at one time sharp picture*
of all objects from immediately in front of
the lens to the greatest distance, it is im
portant to have a lens which will do so
without unduly reducing Its speed. Depth
of focus, as this property Is called. vari<?3
directly with the focus of the lens, being
greatest In the short-focus lenses. Tho
aepth of focus can be Increased In any
lens by "stopping It .down"â that is, cut
ting off the marginal rays and reducing
the speed. Rectilinear lenses have only
half the focal length of single lenses hav
ing the same image circle, hence are'
much more rapid, will make a much
larger picture and have greater depth of
focus. They also possess one other fea
ture- of greater importanceâ the ability to
reproduce straight lines correctly. In th*
single lenses the distortion of the imago
is such that when photographing a build
ing or other objects having parallel lines,
the lines appear crowded together at tha
margin of the picture, while in the rectili
near lena no such distortion occurs. Tho
rectilinear lens has Its defects, being
unable to reproduce lines at different
angles with equal distinctness.
In the manufacture of lenses a varia
tion of 1.000.000 th of an Inch is aa readily
detectable as a hand's breadth difference
In ordmary measurement. All defective
lenses are rejected. Herein ll*Â»s the snare
for the unwary purchaser. The unscru
pulous manufacturer may use lenses with
slight defects such as laymen could not
himself detect, with the result that the
purchaser of such a lens would find him
self with an Instrument from which It is
impossible to obtain the best results, al
though It may be apparently perfect. It
Is for this reason that only lenses by
makers of established Integrity should
ever bÂ« considered.

MANY BEAUTIES OF
PARIS EXPOSITION
VABNEY GASKILL WRITES OF
PREVAILING CONDITIONS.
Says That Hotel Bates Will Be Only
Slightly Advanced and Parisians
Will Not Overcharge.
A communication has been addressed to
The Call by V. W. Gaskill, secretary of
the Paris Exposition Commission of 1900,
in which he writes about conditions as he
has found them to exist in Paris since his
residence In the French capital. He says:
"The exposition and palaces and pavil
ions and the adornments of the grounds
will present to visitors an ensemble ex
quisitely beautiful and commensurate
with the genius of artistic Paris and of
the worldâ all co-laborers in this majestic
apotheosis of the nineteenth century's
close.
"Regarding the alleged overcharge
by the Parisians for all the necessities of
life, I desire to state that there will be an
increase of present hotel rates of only 25
per cent on and after April 1. Prices will
range from $2 per day in the third-class
boarding houses; $3 per day in second
class hotels; $4 to $5 BO per day in small
first-class hotels; and $3 to $10 per day in
the larger first-class hotels in Waldorf-
Astoria style.
"The recently constructed hotels in the
Pasay district, which is contiguous to the
northwestern portion of the exposition
grounds, advertise the cost of sojourn
after April 15 for one person, $4 57 per
day; two persons, $4 30 per day, and three
persons, $4 per day, if all occupy the same
room. Rooms may also be had at a hotel
at an average of $1 50 per day, while nu
merous restaurants serve noon and even
ing meals at prices averaging 52 cents per
meal. The underground Metropolitan
Railway will be in operation soon and will
add greater locomotion facilities."
FIGURE 3.
would have apparently been bent more;
thus It Is that the greater the difference
between the density of the air and that
of the refracting substance the greater
the amount of refraction. Skillful opti
cians take advantage of this fact in the
construction of lenses, combining dense
and light glasses to give the greatest
amount of refraction with the least dis
persion of the light Into Its primary col
ors. The subject of dispersion is one of
great Interest to the photographer, but
one which would require a treatise In
itself to explain thoroughly, hence we
shall content ourselves with the statement
that If objects are viewed through a
prism they appear fringed with colors.
The same is true to a less extent If an
ordinary strong magnifying lens Is substi
tuted for the prism. "Were these color
fringes present, even In the smallest de
gree, in the Image formed by the photo
graphic lens they would cause Indistinct
ness and render the lens useless.
If a ray of light be allowed to pass
through a prism it will be found to pave

Inion Coursing Park to-morrow and Sun
day. The drawing was watched with that
intense interest which characterizes the
big coursing events each year.
In the Belle Brandon cup etake, twenty
"ight puppies whelped In the past year
will compete for high stakes. The win
ner of the stake will receive $SO, the. run
ner up $50. the next two $30 each, the
next three $15 each, the next seven $5
each, the deg beaten by the winner in the
r.rst round $10 and the dog bÂ«aten by the
runner up in the first round $10, making a
total of $290.
The winner of the John Grace cup stake
w:ll receive $750. the runner up $400, the
next three $200 each, the next two $100
each, the next four $70 each and the next
nine $35 each, making a total of $2145.
Added to this big sum le $110, to be de
voted to Fptcia.l prizes as follows: The
<lor beaten by the winner In the first
round $25, in the second round $25; dog
beaten by runner up in first round $20. in
the second round $20; dog beaten in first
round by winner of third prize $10, and
dog beaten in second round $10, making a
prand total of $2205.
The prizes were apportioned by the fol
lowing committee appointed by President
Robert Malcolm: H. H. Gray. R. E. de
I Lopez, Frank McOomb, Harry Perigo
and J H. Harrison. The money and the
list of entries in both events is larger
than at any time since the inauguration
nf the important annual stakes. The Un
ion Coursing Park management added
JICKS to the cum to be devoted as prizes.
Among the entries In the two Etakes are
roes from Ireland, England. Australia,
Minnesota. Texas and the cream of the
<r.ast kennels, thus making the meet the
most important In the history of the sport
in this country. It will be held under the

I H.â THE PHOTO GBAPHIC ILENS.
BY L* B. ELLIOTT.
(Rochester. N. V.)
Every one is more or less familiar with
the action of a lens, yet an air of misti
ness always seems to surround this most
essential part of the photographer's out
fit. The fundamental principles on which
lenses are constructed and which govern
their use are. not at all difficult to under
stand. The action of a lens in forming
a picture depends upon. the fact that light
travels In straight lines until it meet?
.with an obstruction, and if the obstruction
Is one through' which light can passâ i. c..
transparentâ the ray will be bent out of
Its course while passing through the svb-
' stance and again-diverted when it emerges
into the air. This phenomenon constitutes
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1900.
CONTROLLER
CAPTURED A
GOOD STAKE
J. H. Perigo's Dog Showed
Great Specd â Betting Was
Very Lively*
An ideal day and an excellent card drew
a large crowd to Union Coursing Park
yesterday. The midwinter stake of sixty
four entries proved a strong inducement
to the sporting men to wager and
throughout the day four boxes were kept
busy handling money. The stake was re
markable for the evenness of the betting.
Not more than twice during the afternoon
did the betting go over 5 to 1.
The showing of J. H. Perigo's Control
ler, the stake winner, was a revelation.
On two occasions he gladdened the hearts
of short-enders by landing flags. Random
Aim showed great speed and but for his
heavy fall he woulu not have been put
out by Blacklock. Hummer also showed
to advantage and at one stage looked a
stoke winner. The backers of Soft Goods
thi> imported Australian dog. were disap
pointed at his showing. Although the dog
has cleverness it only displayed an aver
age amount of speed.
Following is the way the dogs ran and
the number of points scored in each
course:

ZOROASTER
BEAT GEYSER
IN A RUSH
Corrigan's Pet Lost the Ver
dict by a Scant Head. *
Tanforan Results.
A big crowd of holiday sport seekers
found Its way down to Tanforan Park
yesterday, and many must have thought
they were at one of the coursing parks,
for the fields comprised the cheapest lot
of "dogs" that have sported colors this
season. The one redeeming feature of the
exercises was the defeat of Geyser, the
pet and pride of the Corrigan stables, by
Zoroaster, nearly causing the crowd to go
frantic, as the game little son of Rayon
dOr reached the wire first by the scant
est of heads. It was a "special" over one
and a sixteenth miles. Geyser with
Spencer up, and carrying 116 pounds, being
installed a 1 to 2 favorite, while 2& to 1
was laid about Zoroaster, with Milt Henry
and 111 pounds in the saddle. The track,
which was cuppy and slow, did not suit
F. \V. Brode, the useful colt acting in the
capacity of an "Havana filler." Geyser
showed to be many pounds below a won
der, for when Zoroaster collared him in
the stretch be howled so loud that all the
rest of the dogs on the trade followed suit,
and was eventually beaten out. Spencer
claimed a foul â on the ground that Henry
and his mount bore in, and for nearly five
minutes the judges actually deliberated
as to whether or not the people who
backed the winner were entitled to their
money. On no other track in America
would the absurd claim have received
any consideration and Spencer, according
to racing rules, would have been punished
for his piece of frivolity. Had a repeti
tion of the gross and shameful outrage
occurred when Pat Morrissey was dis
qualified and the race given to Corrigan' s
Adolph Spreckels one day last spring, It
is safe to predict a bloody riot would
have taken place, for the limit has about
been reached. Hundreds of pale-faced
men stood about the judges' stand, and
trouble would certainly have been precipi
tated had Corrigan's horse been given
the race.
As usual the first choices fared badly, four
of them being swept away. Barney Schrei
ber's jockey Henry carried off the saddle
honors by piloting three of the winners.
He is destined to become one of the crack
light weights.
There was nothing to the two-year-old
dash but Corrigan's filly Artena. With
Spencer in the saddle, she ruled. an even
money favorite, winning with the great
est ease from Countess Clara, the rank
outsider of the company. On Time, the
second choice, made a very poor showing.
The track looked just about to the lik
ing of Wyoming, and the unlucky bay
horse went to the post favorite for the
first mile selling affair. Getting anxious
before half the routÂ© had been covered,
T. Walsh, who had the mount on the first
choice, passed Ping, and struck the
stretch Just swinging. Near the paddock,
J. Walsh on Espionage, a 7 to 1 shot, came
with a rush, beating the leader out a neck.
The heavily backed Tappan finished third.
Tempo enjoyed a cake-walk in the mile
and a quarter run, fourth on the card.
Backed from 2 to 1 down to 7 to 6, Henry
early assumed the lead with him, winning
handily from Don Quixote, the Corrigan
entry. Tom Cromwell hobbled in third.
Mat Storn took the fifth number with
Sunello. Four to one was obtainable
against the colt, which won ridden out
from Red Cherry. The favorite. Katie
Gibbons, finished third.
Dr. Marks, the 3 to 5 choice for the final
race, made a miserable showing, landing
outside of the money. Rapido, with Henry
up, enjoyed an easy victory over Inverary
Track Notes.
Listening no doubt In part to the wall of
the "knockers," the judges suspended Vlt
titoe for 30 days, hto ride on Castake not
meeting with their approval. The horsa
was a 30 to 1 shot In the opening betting.
The stand also requested Gaylon Brown
to In future put up a stronger rider on
Wyoming. Turf history would recite that
It is weaker ones that are required.
Following are the weights for the mile
and a furlong handicap to be decided to
morrow:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22.â The eleventh
annual banquet of the Chamber of Com
merce was celebrated to-night In the new
clubhouse erected by the 'women of Los
Angeles. When President M*. J. Newmark
called the assemblage to attention, 225
guests were seated at the six tables, fash
ioned in the form of a horseshoe. In point
of attendance, elegance or servlde and
character of addresess. this function has
never In the history of the Chamber been
excelled. The Menu embraced every viand
from Blue Points to coffee, nearly all
wines being California vintage. The
head of the table was graced by
United States Senator Thomas R. Bard
a*; the guest of honor, who sat between
President Newmark and Toastmaster
John F. Frances.
To the toast, "President of the United
States, Rev. Hugh K. Walker responded.
Rev. S. Hecht, rabbi of the Jewish Syna
gogue, responded to the toast, "George
Washington." "The Oil Industry" was
handled by W. L. Hardlson, president of
the Los Angeles Oil Exchange; "Califor
nia of the Future" was treated by Judge
W. A. Cheney; "Our Friend the Tourist"
fell to the Rev. Robert J. Burdette; "The
Chamber of Commerce" was responded to
by C. D. Wlllard. "The Aim of the Re
public" was assigned to Irving M. Scott,
the San Francisco shipbuilder.
The entrance of former United States
Senator Stephen M. White at a late hour
caused a demonstration that went beyond
the confines of an ovation. He came into
the presence of his fellow townsmen, who
showed their appreciation in his restora
ton to health. His presence caused a
break In the order or spt-eches. By de
mand the. late Senator became the firat
speaker. In his remarks he paid high
tribute to Senator Bard.
"I believe my successor will be as loyal
to the interests of California," White said,
"as I hope I proved myself to have been.
Although politically opposed, we are
neighbors and friends."
As ex-Senator White took his seat. Sen
ator Bard was loudly called. In response.
Senator Bard said that his experience as
a Senator so far had been filled with
pleasure in acknowledging the many
courtesies extended, but he hoped he
would ever be found battling for the in
terests of California, and when he re
turned from Washington might ask the
plaudits of his constiuents.
In an Interview to-night Mr. Scott said:
"The South could have had the Senator
ship last year had the members of the
Legislature from this end of the State j
been united upon one candidate. Will Ij
be a candidate for the Senatorshlp at the
expiration of Mr. Perkins' term of office?
I certainly expect to be, and I expect also

at the gate post and was sent staggering
back. Through Mr. Hobart's skill, neither

than a flutter of excitement among the
onlookers on the, clubhouse veranda. , â¢
The hunt proved a desperate one 'for

Young Men's Institute Celebrates
Birthday of Washington.
The celebration of Washington's birth
cay under the auspices of the board of
management, San Francisco councils.
Your.g Men's Institute, which was held
last evening at Metropolitan Temple, was
en a parallel with the usual high class of
the entertainments arranged by that or
ganization. A programme of exceptional
Interest was rendered, a feature of which
wiis an eloquent and patriotic address by
Krar.k T. Shea.
The programme opened with an over
ture by the League of the Cross Cadets
Band, under. he direction of M. P. Wal
ten. The music was excellent and was
heartily applauded.
Robert Tobln, chairman of the board of
management, called the gathering to or
der and introduced Judge William P.
Lawlor as the presiding officer of the
evening. Judge Lawlor said briefly that
the purpose of the celebration was to do
honor to the memory of the father of
this great land and expressed the belief
that every one in the vast audience wa.s
imbued with patriotic principles and fired
with the love of liberty.
Among the musical numbers were a
contralto solo by Miss Florence Xagei:
cornet solo, George Pacheco; selections
from "The Bohemian Girl." League of the
Cross Cadets Band; soprano solo, Mrs.
Eva Tenney; barytone solo, Oscar S.
Frank; vocal solo, Harry Brown. All
were encored.
There were some clever recitations by
Thomas W. Hickey, who made a decided
hit and was called to the platform re
peatedly. â¢
The address of Mr. Shea was listened to
with the most profound interest. Speak
ing of the Young Men's Institute he said
if it followed its determination to spread
the truth and uphold liberty It would
leave its "footprints on the sands of
time." He said that man dies but hi?
memory lives on according to the mag
nitude and character of his earthly deeds
that the memory of Washington would
never die. but would continue to ring on
through centuries until the end of time.
In closing the celebration Judge Lawlor
on behalf of the Young Men's Institute
expressed his grateful thanks to the au
dience. Â¦-:,..-Â¦' v Â«-]
SUPERB HORSEMANSHIP
SAVES HOBART'S LIFE
Kls Horse Dashes Into a Gatepost.
Burlingame Sports.
Walter 8. Hobarfs superb horseman
eh!p saved his life yesterday, according
to persons who witnessed him take the
last jump in the run of the San Mateo
County hunt in the' twenty-mile run of
the hounds by a circuitous route from
Fair Oaks. The top rail had been re
moved from a stiff fence near Burlingame
Clubhouse. Mr. Hobart ecorned this pre
cautionary measure and sent his gray
horse Royalty at the fence at its highest
point. The horse would have taken -It
without hesitation under ordinary condi-
leave of absence expires he will return to
his duties here."
Regent Arthur Rodgers does not believe
that President McKinley has made Pro
fessor Wheeler an offer of a place on the
commission mentioned, or if such has b<*e\
made that Professor Wheeler will accepr.
"Professor Wheeler la an honorable maT
and certainly would not consider such an
offer without consulting with the Board
of Regents." said Mr. Rodgers. "Thesis
rumors are not to be taken seriously. In
his visits to the President he certainly
had other matters of business to discuss.
No. Professor Wheeler would certainly
have notified the Regents if he had ever
entertained a thought of accepting a po
litical office."
PRESIDENT BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER.
It is not at all likely that President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University
of California would accept an offer of a
place on the Philippine which
President McKlnley is now forming. This
Is the opinion of a number of \he members
of the Board of Regents of the University.
They are morally certain that the recent
meetings between President McKlnley and
Professor Wheeler have been misunder
stood and that these conferences related
to altogether different matters than tht
letter's appointment to a political position,
which at best would be only for a short
term.
"I am sure that these stories about Pro
fessor Wheeler being selected as one of
the Philippine Commissioners are without
foundation." said Regent . Charles W.
Slack. "If he is Interested in that com
mission at all it Is In behalf of Professor
Bernard Mose3, now holding the position
of professor of political srience at Berke
ley. A day or so ago a friend asked me
if I would indorse the candidacy of Pro
fessor Moses for a place on the commis
sion, and from that conversation I In
ferred that Professor Moses* claims were
being advanced by his friend Prof>Â«sor
Wheeler. I believe that Professor Moses
Is eminently fitted for. such an office, be
cause of his familiarity with Spanish his
tory and his knowledge of the islands of
the Pacific, and I would be very willing to
grunt him a leave of absence to accept
such an offer if it should be made him.
"As for Professor Wheeler, there is no
probability that he would consider such
an offer, especially as he has never dis
cussed the subject with any of the Re
gents. The connection of his name with
the Philippine Commission is all a mis
take, and â¢ I am certain that it has no
foundation in fact."
Regent J. B. Relnstein had never even
heard that Professor Wheeler had been
named for the position, nor does he be
lieve that he would accept such commis
sion if it were made.
"The visits of Professor Wheeler to the
President," said Mr. Retnstein. "were for
the purpose of discussing the matters of
a Pacific commercial museum and the
preservation of thÂ» big trees of the Pacific
slope. President McKlnley and Profossor
Wheeler are old friends and although the
President might like to have the professor
on the commission, the latter knows that
he has more than he can attend to at the
univcisity." . Â¦ â
"If the President? Jias offered such an
appointment to Pro. issor Wheeler an<l
the latter accepts." said Regent I. Vf.
Hellman. "it certainly means that both
believe that the professor can in that ca
pacity be of more service to his country
than In his present position. If such he
the case, while I should greatly regret to
lose the services of Profepor Wheeler. 1
would accept the appointment as a wise
one Professor Wheeler went East t-> at
tend the convention of presidents of State
universities, and I believe that when hla
triotic exercises were held at the opera
house in the evening under the auspices
of the Young Men's Institute. The liter
ary programme was of a patriotic nature.
Rev J B. Orr, pastor of the Congrega
tional church, presided. Rev. Father Mc-
Namee of" the Catholic church delivered a
lecture on the divinity of Christ.
