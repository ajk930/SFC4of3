TERS, SACRAMENTO,
Feb. 5. â Thomas R.
Bard will be elected United
States Senator to-morrow by
the Assembly and Senate voting
separately. The splendid victory
which was won last Friday night
will receive the stamp of formal
ity at noon, and if Bard does not
receive the vote of every Repub
lican in the Legislature it will be
because one or two still feel that
they must give a complimentary
vote to a friend. The great fight
is at last pyerjand .in
sion every well-meaning elector
of California can share with Re
publicans the congratulations
which are being made from one
end of the State to the other over
a superb triumph of good gov
ernment, decency and integrity
in public life and the vindication
o f the Republican party from the
severest test that could be made
to men.
The men who stood pledged
to D. M. Burns were authorita
tively released from their obliga
tions to-day, and with that re
lease they hastened to pledge
themselves to vote for Bard to
morrow. They knew that ob
struction to the will of the ma
jority could result only in creat
ing a short delay, at the same
time working their own undoing.
The obstructionists recognized
therefore the wisdom of pre
serving their party fences, and
with this recognition closes one
of the most remarkable if not the
most extraordinary political bat
tles .ever fought in California.
In many respects the election
of Bard is without parallel in the
political history of the State. At
the regular session he was an as
pirant, but not such a one as to
create any interest. He played
no part in the stern struggle of
last winter, and at the opening
of the extra session his name did
not prompt a second thought in
his mind, or in the mind of any
body else. He had given up any
hope of attaining the ambition
for the realization of which he
yearned a year ago. When the
summons came for him to go to
Sacramento he was in his Ven
tura orchard, garbed in the rough
garments of a farmer â in over*
alls and jumper â performing tho
duties of the field.
Then came the call, and Bard
answered it. He hastened to
Sacramento to meet forces that
had been in battle array for over
a year. These forces were sup
plemented by the corrupt power
of the Southern Pacific Company
and of the Governor of the State.
But Bard came to meet them.
He had no organization and no
friends to do for him the mission
ary work which seems always to
be so vital an element in a con-

TREATY SIGNED BY
HAY AND PAUNCEFOTE
It Is Said No Concessions Were Made
to England in Return for
Her Action.
WASHINGTON, Feb. s.â The Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, amendatory of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty relative to the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal, was
signed at the State Department to-day by
Secretary Hay for the United States and
Lord Pauncefote for Great Britain.
Though the consummation of the treaty
occupied some time, owing to the neces
sity of comparing the two drafts, there
was little formality about the ceremony
and the convention that is expected to be,
for the United States at least, of the
most far-reaching Importance and value,
came into being without any theatrical
surroundings. There were present be-
Eides Secretary Hay and Lord Pauncefote
only Mr. Bromley, honorary attache of
the British embassy and prospective son
in-law of Lord Pauncefote: Sidney Smith,
chief of the Diplomatic Bureau, and Wil
liam Gwynn. the faithful and discreet
messenger to the Department of State,
who placed the seals upon this convention
as he has on nearly every treaty of im
portance to which the United States has
been a party for the past thirty years.
The first thing in order was to compare
the two drafts of the treaty carefully, to
insure their Identity, which work was
performed by Smith and Bromley. Then
the signing took place. Secretary Hay at
taching his signature first to the copy of
the treaty which is to be retained by the
United States Government. As the final
ratifications the seals were attached and
then there were congratulations and the
ceremony was over.
Smith and Bromley retired and Secre
tary Hay and Lord Pauncefote had a long
private chat.
Smith carried the freshly signed treaty
to the White House, where the letter of
transmittal was signed by the President
so that the treaty could be dispatched at
once to the United States Senate for rati
ficaion. The letter of transmittal was
purely formal, simply commending the
treaty to the Senate without entering
upon any argument to demonstrate Its
great value.
Secretary Hay declined to make public
the text of the treaty or even to make
any statement as to Its details, holding
that courtesy to the Senate obliged him
to remain silent until the Senate Itself
removed the seal of confidence from the
treaty. All that Is now known of thi3
convention is that It amends the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty of ISSO in such manner that
Great Britain yields to the United States
the right to construct the Nicaragua
canal or a canal at any other point on the
Isthmus without British participation.'
Most of the other features In the Cla>-tan-
BARD RECEIVING CONGRATULATIONS AT HIS HEADQUARTERS.
fact that the first news of the success
of the^ attempt to reach an agreement on
this important subject came from London
was the ground for the belief In some
quarters that the negotiations were all
conducted there. As soon as the treaty
is ratified and 'the ratifications have been
exchanged the United States will be at
liberty to proceed at once with the con
struction of the Isthmian canal unfettered
by any obligations toward Great Britain
save that of allowing to British citizens
and to the citizens of other nations the
â¢use of the canal on the same terms with
American citizens. . . Â¦
Possibly this might have been done
with6ut to-day's treaty, for the question
as to whether or not the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty "were still alive has 'been a subject
of controversy for. many years and many
able minds have taken opposite sides. But
the present, administration is convinced
that the Clayton-Bulwer' treaty is still in
force, and it felt itself bound by the most
sacred obligations to live up to the treaty
as long as It stood unchanged; and desir
ing to amend it resorted to the only
honorable means in Its judgment to realize
Its desires. .Hence the treaty signed to
day.
There is absolutely no quid pro quo of
fered to-Great Britain in this treaty in
return for the valuable concession to the
United States. . Whatever return the
United States may choose to make for
this concession is a thing of the future.

CLAYTON-BULWER PACT
CONSIDERED OBSOLETE
British Cabinet Begarded the Agree
ment as Out of Date and Im
practicable.
LONDON, Feb. s.â While the publica
tion of the dispatch from Washington re
garding the annulling of the Clayton-
Bulwer Nlcaraguan treaty and the sub
stitution for it of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty caused considerable surprise, it
was fully confirmed at the Foreign. Of
fice. The apparent celerity In reaching an
agreement is explained by the fact that
the whole matter was practically settled
between Secretary Hay and Lord Paunce
fote in IS9S. About a fortnight ago. in
consequence of the attitude of the Senate.
Mr. Choate here received Instructions to
press the conclusions of the negotiations.
The British Cabinet considered the ques
tion and received the Dominion of Can
ada's sanction to grant the United States'
request.
The attitude of the Cabinet consisted In
the belief that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
was made when the conditions governing
the nations was so utterly different that
it was now out of date and impracticable.
Believing the present a most inopportune
time for bargaining and haggling, the
British Ministers decided to give the
United States a free hand.
The Westminster Gazette this afternoon
alone comments on the Nicaragua agree
ment. It welcomes the announcement, but
says it is surprised that Great Britain
does not get compensation for "relin
quishing her undoubted rights." The pa
per realizes that Lord Salisbury may have
good reasons for assenting- to this, but
hopes Great Britain's friendly action will
count In the settlement of the Alaskan
dispute.
It can be definitely said, however, that
this decision is based in no little degree
on -the principle of "I'll do you a good
turn, but. remember it when .you have
the chance to do me one." though this
scarcely merits being called even a ver-

HOTEL, WASHING
TON, Feb. 5. â A trans-isthmian
canal under American control is
now assured. The amendment
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty re
moves what might have been a
diplomatic obstacle to Govern
ment construction of the water
way. Both the Senate and
House committees have voted
without a dissenting voice to re
port practically identical bills.
Senator Morgan of Alabama,
chairman of the Senate Commit
tee, said ro-day he expected the
bill to pass the Senate this
month. Representative Hep
burn, chairman of the House
Committee, said he expected it
to pass the House during this
month. A poll of both houses
recentl}' published in The Call
shows that when it comes to a
vote the bill will pass both houses
by overwhelming majorities.
Both bills, while differing in
language Bomewhat, authorize
the President to secure from
Nicaragua and Costa Rica con
trol of such territory as may be
r.ecessarv to construct and de-
fend the proposed canal and
make an indefinite appropriation
to be used in securing' such con
trol. Citizens of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica are to have the same
advantage in the use of the ca
nal as citizens of the United
States. An appropriation of Sio,
000,000 is made for the com
mencement of the work, and the
Secretary of War is authorized to
enter into contracts for its com
pletion to the amount of $140,
000,000, the money to be pro
vided in regular annual appro
priation bills as it shall be
needed.
There is no reason to expect
any serious efforts to delay the
bill in either house of Congress.
Its opponents are so few as to
make such efforts hopeless, and
the prospects are that votes will
be reached in both houses after
short debates. When Mr. Reed
was Speaker he was able to pre
vent consideration of the bill in
the House, but Speaker Header
son is heartily in favor of it and
will aid in expediting action.
Chairman Hepburn's present
plan is to try to secure the con
sideration of the bill by unani
mous consent. Speaker Hender
son has intimated to him that
this can probably be secured. If
there is objection to considera
tion by any of the opponents of
the measure, Mr. Hepburn will
then apply to the Committee on
Rules for a special order, and he
has no doubt of its being granted,
as all the members of that com
mittee are in favor of the bill.
In the Senate the financial bill
will have the right of way until
Bulwer treaty are retained. This -is
notably true of article V, which guaran
tees the absolute neutrality of any. canal
and the security of the capital invested.
It is understood that the United States
continues upon itself the obligation to
maintain the neutralization of the canal,
which shall be open and free. It is also
believed that the treaty looks to an inter
national undertaking on this point. Be
cause the requirements of international
courtesy would not otherwise be observed
it is believed that the Senate will not
make the convention public , before X to
morrow at the earliest, and on this. point
there has been some understanding -be
tween Secretary Hay and the British GoyÂ«
eminent. Â¦'.
The treaty was arranged between Sec
retary Hay and Lord Pauncefote, who
are the principals and who manifest ; that'
fact by signing the treaty. Possibly the

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. s.â The Democrats met in
caucus to-night In the Supreme Court
demonstrated that their ideal in
politics is purity, not corruption;
that they honor and wish to re
ward men of ability and probity.
In past elections the trail of the
Southern Pacific Companyâ
sometimes covered, sometimes
open â has inevitably" and almost
universally been traced. If the
giant corporation could not elect
a man of its own price and choos
ing, it would at least fall- on the
winning side by the contribution
of some strength, its polluting
taint would be found somewhere,
but in the election of Thomas R.
Bard the Southern Pacific Com
pany has taken no part. It is
thrust out of the councils of the
Republican leaders of California,
and it should be kept out. This
alone ought to be a theme for
congratulation to the whole peo
ple of California.
During this entire contest,
which began shortly before the
regular session and which has
raged with more or less fury ever
since, The Call has preserved an
unalterable, unswerving policy
to oppose any and all attempts
to place in the United States
Senate any man who was un
worthy of the honor he sought.
It is a matter of the greatest mo-
also obtained by the exercise of tact and
Judgment permission to destroy the incor
rect version which had been presented to
him for approval.
.When Mr. Bard was asked if he
had entered into any arrangements
, with Burns so far as patronage was
concerned he, replied: "None what
ever. The subject was not mentioned
at our meeting."
When Mr. Bard was asked con
cerning Burns' visit he said: "Colonel
Burns called to see me about 3 o'clock
this .afternoon, after his followers
had unanimously resolved to support
me. I was not in when he called,
but learning of his call I returned
the visit and we talked for about ten
minutes. The subject of patronage
was not mentioned."
Mr. Bard was asked if he did not
feel under obligations to the South
ern Pacific Railroad for his election
and to this he replied: "None what
ever." , ,
When asked if he had ever met Herrin,
Mr. Bard at first replied in the negative,
hut. reflecting, called to mind that he met
Herrin three years ago in connection with
the sale of a piece of land to the railroad.
Mr. Bard was asked if he did not expect
the support of the members of the Legis
lature who had been voting for Colonel
Burns. TC this inquiry he replied that he
expected the support of all Republicans
after he had been chosen as the nominee
of the Republican caucus. w.' :
On topics of national character Mr.
Bard pronounced himself an earnest sup
porter of the administration of President
McKinley.l He also declared In favor of
maintaining our new possessions and up
holding the flag wherever it floated. He
also pronounced himself in favejr of the
Republican doctrine of protection. Speak
ing further of national questions, he said
he was in favor of an istttmian canal to
be controlled by the United States alone.
He declared himself opposed to the aggre
gation of capital for the purpose qf^ mo
nopolizing or restraining trade. His posi
tion touching harbor construction at San
Pedro was very clearly defined.' He re
gards the Santa Monica proposition as a
dead issue. :Â¦. . Â¦'Â¦' Â¦ '
Mr. Bard was asked If he agreed with
Senatdr' Perkins 1 In asking- Instructions
from the Legislature, and to this Inquiry
he replied that In matters of -conscience
he would exercise his own Judgment, but
on questions affecting, the public welfare
he would respect the judgment of the peo
ple expressed through the Legislature.. ,

eager to extend their congratulations to

Daniel M. Burns. The winner and loser
exchanged cordial greetings and gave as

BRITISH PEOPLE
EXPECT SOME RETURN
.LONDON, Feb. 6.â ln commenting upon
the amendment to -the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty the Dally Chronicle says: "Ther*
can be ~ no" question that this agreement
regarding the. canal between two friendly
nations Is a matter for congratulation, not
merely to themselves but the world at
large, which will materially benefit by the
construction of this great waterway."
The Chronicle Is "unwilling to believe
that British rights under the treaty have
been abandoned without reciprocal con
sideration.*"
. The Times says: "We can see no serioua
objection on our part to the completion,
under exclusively American auspices, of
a work which may have aa great an Influ
ence on the trade of the civilized world as
the Suez canal. It is to be regretted that
other outstanding difficulties have not
been settled, as had been hoped, at the
same time; but as the Idea of joint Anglo-
American construction was long ago
abandoned we have no Interest In resist
ing a project beneficial to the world's
trade,"
The Daily News says: "Secretary Hay
has won a great diplomatic triumph. He
has procured the formal abrogation of the
treaty without giving anything In return.
The American victory Is remarkably com
plete. It would cave been churlish and
ungracious to prevent the construction of
the canal, but something might have been
expected In return, either for Canada or
ourselves."
TREATY WITH ENGLAND
READ IN THE SENATE
WASHINGTON. Feb. 5.-The treaty
with Great Britain relative to the build
ing of. the Nicaragua canal Â«v received
by the Senate to-day and was read in
executive session. Senator Davis, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions, moved, to make the treaty public,
as it waa a subject In which all were
greatly Interested, but after some discus
sion It was decided to refer the matter
to the Committee on Foreign Relations
before taking that step.
The comments of Senators upon the
treaty, after hearing It read, were favor
able. It was to allow the United State*
all the authority that waa needed and
the neutrality of the canal was guaran
teed as was the neutrality of the Suez
canal. *>Â¦.;..;** â...,,..
ment to the State, therefore; that
a man in every way qualified to
the high post. of Federal Sena
torship has been chosen. Time
after time The Gall urged that
the Senatorial problem should
be removed from the next cam
paign, or the success of the Re
publican party might' be jeopar
dized. This urging has borne
splendid fruit, and to-day the
Republican party of California
stands encouraged and strength
ened within itself, cleansed from
polluting influences and . ready
for the great battle that will so
soon be fought. To attain such
a welcome result has been the
sole inspiration of the uncompro
mising policy of The Call.
It is a matter of deeply signifi
cant interest to know that D. M.
Burns did not retire from, the
contest in which he had no legiti
mate place until he - had been
whipped out by the votes of hon
est men. When he' ceased to be
a factor, he* announced his . \\4th
drawaV gainuig.neither.credit ,iior
recognition for the announce
ment. , To-day his . follpwers
pledged themselves \tq'WQte for
Thomas R. : Bard f of v United
States Senator. Burns addressed
them and said a few wonls that
he believes will, preserve some
thing from the wreck .of his po
litical fortunes. .----.--
. But he seems not to know- that
the men who, followed him are
now the only . ories 'who . feel in
bitterness towarcf him:" > They re
sent the selfishness that has left
them stranded and which, from
trickery and bluster, won rioth-
Their quarrel, however, is with
the man they followed. The peo
ple of California are concerned
solely with the great victory
which has rehabilitated the Re
publican party and restored to it
the confidence which it deserves
from .the people of the State arid
which it has so often won in many
a good cause.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. s.â ln the choice of Thomas
R. â¢ Bard for the high office of United
States Senator the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company was not consulted. D. M.
Burns was not consulted. Mr. Herrln's
consent was not solicited. The selection
was made by members of the Legislature
who recognized no allegiance to the power
of the railroad corporation. Democratic
journals deriving subsidies from the rail
road and doing the railroad's work in the
Legislature had no voice in bringing the
name of Thomas R. Bard to the notice of
the members. Mr. Bard came to Sacra

at the request of members of the Senate
and Assembly who. had, faith in his ability
to win and confidence in the belief that he
would worthily serve the people of the

Special efforts are being made in
certain Democratic circles to create
the impression that Mr. Bard made
arrangements withHerrln and Burns
for the division of Federal patronage.
An attempt was made to-night to get
Mr. Bard to approve of a statement
that he expected the support of the
men who were voting for Burns. The
trap spread for the distinguished Re

The statement purported to be the es

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. s.â Senate constitutional
amendment No.- 2, which proposes to
amend section 5. article 11. of the con
stitution, may encounter vigorous oppo
sition before the Legislature adjourns. If
the constJtutldn.be amended In the man
ner, proposed the power'iWill be conferred
upon T Ãoards "of Supervisors .to designate
the number, of clerks and deputies to-be"
employed" in thÂ« offices of Sheriff, County

The power of Supervisors to fix the com

"The compensation of such officer* and
the number and compensation of their

were ready to do anything to
score success.
And when he arrived here he
found that he had been chosen
United States Senator by a ma
jority of the Republicans. He
had been asked to make no con
cession or compromise. He had
been compelled to make no deal.
He was absolutely free to exer
cise the great power of his new
office as his judgment dictated.
His position is without parallel,
with the exception of that of ex-
United States Senator Stephen
M. White, whom he succeeds in
the history of California.
The Republican party had
risen to the tremendous emerg
ency it had been called upon to
meet. It had justified its exist

CaLL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. s.â This aXternoon the erst
while supporters of Daniel M. Burns as
sembled In caucus and after two hours
of close discussion decided to cast their
votes for Thomas R. Bard for Senator to
morrow noon when the ballot Is ordered In
both houses. Although the vote taken
upon the question was unanimous, consid
erable opposition was developed during
the axg-uments which preceded It. Colonel
Uurns himself was present throughout th*
meeting, and it was due to a speech made
l>y him that the two factions created by
the proposition to go over to the Vcn
turan'e side were united. Colonel Burn*
assured his followers that when he Issued
Ms notice of withdrawal he did co in all
sincerity, ar.d that the only duty they
had before them was the election of a
Benator to succeed Stephen M. \VhÂ«to. "I
have no commands to give you," Burns Is
reported to have said. "You are free to do
as you please, but my advice as a friend
is that you cast your votes for Mr. Bard
for Senator. Mr. Bard is an excellent
man. ar.d I am satisfied will make a good
representative for California." Mr. Burns
closed with hearty thanks to the men v.ho
ttood with him through more than a year
of hard fighting. He pave way to others,
uho followed his lead and advised their
fellows to vote for Bard upon the first
Assemblyman H. W. Miller -of San Fran
cisco said that no matter what cours*
others pursued, he proposed to vote for
Bard to-morrow noon, and that he knew
trough more who had like intention to as-
Fure Mr Bard's election. Assemblyman
Cobb took a elmilar position, but Jonnson
cf Sacramento. Lundquist of San tran
cisco and two or three others were in
clined to stand out and attempt to force
concessions from the other side.
Further declarations of intentions, how
ever soon convinced him that they would
onlv'lose by fighting, and they finally ac
ouiescd in the general scheme, and so
cast their votes. To-night some of them
who had builded high hopes on Burns
election are Â«=ttll dissatisfied, but are re
tolved to abide by Burns' advice ana the
caucus agreement. .
After the result of the meeting naa hctn
circulated generally a committee, consist
ing of Charles M. Shortridge. Grove L.
Johnson and H. C. Dibble, prepared along
statement of the position taken by I>urns
nnd his followers since the calling of the
present session. It reads as follows:
This extra fusion of the Thirty-third L^sris
la'ure was convened for the purpose, among
other thing*, of electing a United States Sen
ator to nueeeed the Hon. Stephen M. White,
and In order to put that purpose into effect
Â« rail for a Republican caucus was circulated
and elgned by all of the Republican members
of the Legislature; *aid call contained an
ftgreemect that forty-three votes should be
necessary to nominate a United States Sena
tor and contained a further agreement (which
was added after the call had been signed by
c larre number of the members of the Legis
lature) providing In express terms that the
right to votÂ» for the candidate of his choice
Fhould not be abridged or denied any mem-
Yter of the caucus. Such caucus met Thursday,
February U lSiÂ». and after takinsr six ballots
adjourned without naming a candidate. Sub
sequently a meeting was called by a number
of members of the caucus for Friday. Feb
ruary 2. at 4:39 o'clock, to which meeting thÂ«?
injpporterf of Colonel D. M. Burns were not
Invited, and in which they did not participate,
and which meeting was attended by only forty
one Republican members of the Legislature.
At this meeting thus attended by a minority
or.ly of the Republican members of the Legis
lature, it was decided to ballot for a United
States Senator and further decided that two
thirds of the members present and voting â
to-wit: twenty-eightâ should be sufficient to
bind those present to vote in the general cau
cus for the candidate receiving the twenty
eight votes and that all other candidates be
dropped thus violating both the spirit and the
letter of the agreement entered Into by all
the Republican members when they signed tne
call for the caucus, which agreement was
never set aside nor abrogated at any meeting
of said general caucus in this.
First, by reducing the number of votet necei
eary to nominate, to wit., from 43 to 28; and
Second, by denying the right of member* to
vote for the candidate of their choice;
Third, by proceeding without a majority or
the caucus: and â¢ ? .
Fourth, by holding a secret caucus to which
thirty-two of the Republican members were
not invited. .
Upon hearing of this breach of good faith
and violation of said solemn agreement the
supporters of Colonel D. M. Burns appointed a
committee of three of their number consisting
of Assemblymen Grove L. Johnson and Henry
C. Dibble and Senator Charles M. Shortridge
to wait upon the members assembled In the
Assembly chamber on the evening of February
2, 1900, the time and place for reassembling
of said Republican caucus, to aek them to
rescind the agreement so made In violation of
the general caucus agreement and permit each
member to vote for the candidate of his choice.
Said committee was refused recognition or a
hearing and thereupon withdrew. Thereafter,
while we who had been supporters of Colonel
L>. M. Burns were listening to the report of
said committee, and notwithstanding the fur
ther fact that there were lees than sixty mem
bers present at the meeting so held as afore
said, that number- being absolutely requisite to
constitute a quorum, said members present
did there and then vote for and declare Hon.
Thomas R. Bard the candidate of the Republi
can party for the office of United States Sen
ator. These actions thus objected to by us we
feel assured were not dona with the knowledge
or consent of the Hon. Thomas R. Bard.
We fetrl that we have been most unfairly
dealt with and that the solemn agreement
entered into by all the Republican members
of the Legislature has been violated and set
aside, but we know that a situation confronts
us of most Berlous Import to the welfare of
the Republican party and the State of Cali
fornia. We recog-nire the fact that our refusal
to vote for the Hon. Thomas R. Bard for
United Ftates Senator, although Justified by
the farts, *ould probably result In the failure
to select a United States Senator at this ses-
Flon. thus depriving the State of Ca'tfomia of
Us proper quota of representation Jn tte United
States Senate: that It would mean one vote
less to uphold the arms of the Federal ad
ministration and to support our worthy Presi
dent, his Excellency William McKlnley, to say
nothing In regard to th<> expense to the peo
ple of the State of California that might be
entailed by the continuance of this extra ses
sion.
Under these circumstances our esteemed can
didate. Colonel . D. M. Burns, having only at
heart the Interest of the Republican party and
the welfare of this State, has withdrawn his
name from further consideration for the office
of United State? Senator In order that his
personality may not be !n the way of the
selection of a United States Senator.-
We have the utmost confidence in the In
tegrity, ability, purity of purpose and Ftanch
Republicanism of our personal friend and can
didate, the Hon. D. M. Burns; wÂ« still recog
nize and believe that he was well fitted to
represent the State of California in the United
State* Senate. We know, however, that we
owe a duty to the Republican party that we
represent in general and to our constituent*
in particular, that demands of us the sacrifice
of our personal feelings and preferences in
order that a United States Senator may be
elected at this extraordinary session, therefore
we. the friends and supporters of Colonel D.
M. Burns unanimouFly agree to cast our bal
lots for the Hon. Thomas R. Bard for the office
of United States Senator.
In this statement and resolution our candi
date concurs.

the English people has been the calm, im
movable and impassive manner with
which they have received much bad and
very little good news. At no time have
they lost their self-control, or allowed
themselves to approach anything like a
frenzied condition, such as has been stat
ed in some continental journals. Almost
every one approves General Buller's pol-
Jcy of silence, all understanding that he
may be keeping the Boers busy, and at
the Fame time preventing their paying too
much attention to Ladysmith. The possi
bility of another repulse is already dis
counted here, and would not cause any
remarkable etlvct now.
All eyes are directed toward Lord Rob
erts and Kitchener now. rather than to
ward Buller. They are looked upon as
having a force which will be used to di
vert the attention of the Boers, both at
Ladysmith and in the Free State. Mr.
Chamberlain in his speech in the House
of Commons yesterday confirmed this
when he stated that Lord Roberts would
soon be strong enough to begin the exe
cution of the original plan of campaign
through the Free State,, independent of
Buller and White.
General French is already In motion and
has pushed forward a strong force of in
fantry to seize NorvrJs Pont. According
to dispatches the British forces are con
verging on that place from the Hanover
road and the De Aar-Naauwpoort line
from Naauwpoort. and from RenEburg on
the line from Colesberg. General Gatacre
ought to be making a conforming move
ment toward Burghersdorp and the
Bethulle bridge. General Kelly-Kenny; is
between them with at least a brigade,
and may cut in at the back of the Boer
position to help French's division to se
cure Norvals Pont. It Is at Norvals Pont
that the railway from Naauwpoort and
Rosmead Junction enters the Orange I< rce
State, and this route is the one that th-Â«
Boers at Colesberg must follow if lh?y
should be able to retreat.
LARGE FORCE SENT TO
SEIZE NORVALS PONT
LONDON. Feb., 6.â Military opinion In
London continues to assume from very
slender materials that General Buller is
again throwing his army against the Boer
forces. A retired" general. Sir William
Henry Green, whose distinguished career
gives weight to his opinion, thinks that
General Buller, with 25,000 men. is making
a wide detour to tho west and north in or
der to avoid the roughest parts of , the
country. As General Buller must have
It is from the western field the most
definite statements come. Large opera
tions are apparently about to begin. Gen
eral French, who has now returned to
Rensburg from his conference with Lord
Roberts, has sent what is described as^ an
overwhelming force of Infantry to seize
Norvals Pont. That is- where the railway,
before It was destroyed, crossed the Or
ange River and connected with the Free
State trunk line at Bloemfontein. Nor
vals Pont is nineteen miles north of Coles
berg 1 and twenty-five miles from General
French's'headquarters at Rensburg. The
Boers at Colesberg have been in danger
of being surrounded by the largely rein
forced and extending lines of the British.
An occupation of Norvals' Pont in force
would presumably render . Colesberg un
tenable. 4
The Boers are showing great activity in
the Naauwpoort and Colesberg districts
Many of the guns hitherto facing Lord
Methuen are believed to have gone to
Norvals Pont. The British, therefore,
may find formidable bodies of Boers
there.
The War Office announces that fifteen
transports will be dispatched between to
day and Monday, with 13,000 troops.
Sir Alfred Milner, in a letter written
three weeks ago to the former Lord Mayor
of Belfast, said the war would last three
or four months longer.
The censorship seems to have complete
ly shut out the correspondents at Spear
man's Camp. No dispatch from that point
appeals in this morning's papers" and
nothing has been allowed to issue since
Sunday evening.
A dispatch to the Times from Queens
town. Cape Colony, dated Monday, says:
"General Brabant, while addressing one
of the regiments of the colonial division
on parade yesterday, said they were leav
ing the next morning for the front, not to
return, he hoped, until the task entrusted
to him by Lord Roberts had been success
fully accomplished. He could not disclose
the plan of operations, but if his inten
tions were carried out the greatest glut
ton for fighting among them would have
his fill."
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle says:
"The South African League has passed
a resolution declaring that it regards with
regret, and almost with despair, the prob
ability of the authorities trying colonial
rebels before a Jury. .The resolution urges
a court-martial. Mr. Schrelner, the Pre
mier, replying to a letter inclosing a copy
of the resolutions, , pays : the Government
has taken steps to present the cases to
Juries !n order to prevent undue detention
of persons charged with sedition."

he be permitted to go to his home In East
Liverpool, Ohio, for a few days to attend

Mr. Macruin .promised to be back here
soon, perhaps before the end of the pres

a formal report to the State Department.
Leaving Dr. Hill Mr. Macrum went to the
â¢Consular Bureau and secured the assent
of acting Chief Carr to a postponement of

CHAMBERLAIN ADMITS
MISTAKES WERE MADE
LONDON,- Feb. s.â ln the House of

the Secretary "of State for the Colonies,
Joseph Chamberlain, admitted that a crit
ical stage of the war had been reached
and that the situation was. undoubtedly
serious, though he added he did not.be
lieve the country was in danger. If the
preparation for war, had been insufficient,
he said, it was wholly due to the fact that
the Government was determined to do
everything to secure peace and to do
nothing" to endanger it. Chamberlain fur
ther, declared that the war was Just, nec
essary and rigiiteous. He regretted the
proposed amendment to the address, be

PARIS. Feb. s.â As a result of Inquiries
! made in proper quarters, it Is ascertained
that the stories of the Echo de Paris that
the British Embassador to France. Sir
Edmund J. Monson. and the British Em
bassador to Italy, Sir Philip Currie. con
ferred here recently on Italian affairs,
and that Sir Edmund had gone to Roma
to support Sir Philip in representations to
Italy regarding the landing of Italian
troops "in Africa, are quite unfounded.
What is true is that Sir Edmund Monson
has gone to the Italian Riviera, not be
cause he Is unwell or requires a rest, but
because he finds his position very un
pleasant at the present moment, owing to
the strong feeling against Great Britain
in the press and society, which, perforce,
is reflected to some extent in the attituda
of the French Government. A diplomatic
official said:
"The French Government is undoubted
ly friendly to Great Britain, but it Is un
able to make a display of its real senti
ments just now. because a demonstration
of friendliness to Great Britain, would be
an act of suicide. The bestowal of th>
cross of the Legion of Honor on the artist
Leandre. author of the outrageous cari
catures of Queen Victoria, furnished an
example of the Government's fear of
offending popular feeling. Leandre had,
been promised the decoration before ha
caricatured Queen Victoria, and the Gov
ernment felt it would be safer to offend.
the English people than the sentiments
of its own countrymen. In view of this
situation. Sir Edmund thought his tem
porary absence from the Anglophobic air
of Paris would have a salutary effect."
M. Firmln Faure. one of the Algerian
Deputies, member from Gran, has given
notice of a question to the French For
eign Minister, M. Delcasse. with refer
ence to the reports that Italy Intends to
assist Great Britain by replacing the
British troops withdrawn from Egypt.
This may elicit an interesting statement
on the part of the French Government
as to the attitude the European powers
would assume in view of such movement
The view of the French Government is that
Italy will not entangle herself in a situa
tion which would certainly call for a pro
test from the powers, and that Marquis
Viscount Venosti, the Italian Minister of?
Foreign Affairs, is too prudent and skill
ful, a diplomatist to run the risk of burn

DESTRUCTION OF FARMHOUSES
CAPE TOWN. Feb. 6.â President Steyn
and President Kruger have communicated
with Field Marshal Lord Roberts, the
British commander in chief, protesting
against the destruction of farmhouses
and the devastation of property. Lord
Rdberts, in replying, declared the charges
were not sustained, adding that wanton
destruction of property was contrary to
British practices. .
Following is the text of the protest,
which is dated Bloemfontein, February 3:
"WÂ« learn front many sides that the British
troops, - contrary to the recognized usages of
war. dally destroy property by burning or
dynamiting farmhouses and devastating farms
and the goods therein, by means of which un
protected women and children are often de
prived of food and cover. This happens not
only in places where barbarians are en
couraged by British officers, but even In Cape
Colony md the Free State, where white brig
ands come out from the theater of war with
the evident Intention of carrying on general
devastation, without any reason recognized by
the customs of war and without in any way
furthering the operations. We wish earnestly
to protest against such acts.
9>rd Roberts, replying to-day, said:
I beg to acknowledge the honor of your tele
gram charging the- British troops with the
destruction cf property, contrary to the recog
nized usages of war. and brigandage and de
vastation. These charges are made in vague
and general terms. No specific case is men
tioned. No evidence Is given. I have seen
such charges made before now In the press,
but In no case which has come under my no
tice have they been substantiated. The most
stringent Instructions hare b?pn issued to the
British troops to respect private property. Â«o
far as It Is compatible with the conduct of
military operations. AH wanton destruction to
peaceful Inhabitants Is contrary to British
practice and traditions, and will. If necessary,
be rigorously repressed by me. Â¦ I regret that
your honors have seen fit to repeat this untrue
statement that barbarians have been encour
aged by British officers to commit depreda
tions. In the onty case In which a raid has
been perpetrated by native subjects â¢ of the
Queen the act was contrary to the Instructions
of the British officer nearest the spot, and en
tirely disconcerted his operations. The women
and children taken prisoners by the natives
were restored to their homes by the agency of
the British officer In question. I regret to say
that it Is :th? republican forves which are In
some cases sullty of carrying on the war In a
manner not â¢ in accordance with ctvllized
urages. I refer especially to the expulsion of
loyal subjects of her Majesty 'rom ihetr homes
In the Invaded districts of this colony because
they have refused to be commanded by the
invader. It is barbarous to attempt to force
men to take sides against their o-wn sovereign
and country by threats of spoliation and ex
pulsion. Men. women and children have had
to leave thelc homes owing to such compulsion.
Many of those who were formerly in comfort
able circumstances are now maintained by
charity. That war should Inflict harshlps and
injury upon peaceful inhabitants is inevitable.
but It Is the desire of her Majesty's Government
and my Intention to conduct this war with as |
little injury as possible to peaceable inhabit
ants and private property. ( hope your hon
ors will exercise your authority to Insura It be
ing conducted In a similar spirit on your
side.

end those administering it. In the mean
time blame us.
"What is now urgent is to redress those
checks and to repair mistakes. You w.y
we have' sent too few troops; but we are
pouring them into South Africa. In a
few weeks we will have 200.000 men there.
We will have as many mounted men as
there are mounted Boers.
"Meanwhile the spirit of the nation is
unbroken. There is no sacrifice which we
are unwilling to make. There is.no sacri
fice we are unwilling to ask of the col
onies, if we think it necessary to success.
I must go further than this and admit
that this war, under new conditions, in
a new country, with new arms, against a
people whose tenacity and courage are
admirable as the courage and tenacity of
our own soldiers, has required a larger
scheme than any the Government has yet
been called upon to meet.
"It would be premature," continued the
Colonial Secretary, "to talk of terms of
settlement. Speaking for the Govern
ment,'there .will be no second Majuba
Hill. Never again shall, the Boers erect
in .the heart: of South Africa a citadel
whence to proceed to disaffection and race
animosity. Never again shall they be
able -to endanger the paramountcy of
Great Britain. | Never again shall they be
able to treat an Englishman as though he
belonged to an inferior race."
Sir William Vernon Harcourt. Liberal,
declared the war was due to a reversal of
the policy laid down by the Government
in 1881 and 1895. -Reviewing the negotia
tions. Sir William said the great misfor
tune was that the men consulted in. regard
to the situation in South Africa were the
authors of the raid and the "helots of
Park Lane."
Here Chamberlain interjected: "Does
the right - honorable gentleman mean to
assert that the persons to whom he refers
were consulted by the Colonial Office and
that no others were consulted?"
The Liberal statesman parried the ques
tion. 4
John Dillon said that the Nationalists,
believing the war- to be an "unjust and
iniquitous war of aggression, entirely un
provoked," were unable to support an
amendment declaring that the war should
be prosecuted with vigor. Dillon, con
tinuing, said that the military reputation
of England was irreparably ruined; that
the Boers had established a claim to be
free, and that no amount of brute force
could ever diminish their claim.
Leonard Courtney. Unionist, said he did
not wonder that Chamberlain displayed
such energy and debating power, as he
had to vindicate not only the nation and
the Government, but himself. â¢
"This is Mr. Chamberlain's war." said
Courtney, "and if anybody else had been
at the Colonial Office there would have
been no war."
At this point Chamberlain interposed,
reiterating that since the Jameson raid
he had had no communication with
Rhodes on political affairs in South Af
rica, either direct or indirect.
Courtney explained that he had noT
meant to Imply this. . '
After further discussion the debate was
adjourned.
ATTENTION OF POWERS

PARIS, Feb. 6.â The Matin says this

the time has not come to enforce the

Suez canal. If England is incapable of
keeping order, they will be obliged to in

Detailing possible operations of Gen
erals French, Gatacre and Kelly-Kenny,
Mr. Wilkinson says:
"There is now a prospect that in two or
three weeks the British forces will be
holding the passes of the Orange River,
repairing the bridges and collecting all
the requisites for the advance northward,
to begin as soon as Lord Roberts sees his
way to order the movement.
VThere are now more than enough
troops between the coast and -Orange
River to form three infantry divisions
and a cavalry division, without counting
either the colonial mounted troops or live
militia battalions, which can be used to
relieve regular battalions on the lines of
communication. Lord Methuen's three
brigades make a further addition that
might ultimately be utilized."
Mr. Wilkinson then proceeds to urge
the Government to make every prepara
tion against emergencies at home, and
particularly to put the volunteers and all
available forces in the most complete con
dition for service if needed. He recom
mends rearming the volunteers, supplying
batteries of position with the best modern
guns and. in short, the organization and
equipment of the available forces, ratlier
than hasty endeavors to recruit untrained

MACRUM SILENT
AS TO HIS MOTIVES
WASHINGTON. Feb. s.â Mr. Macrum
has come and gone and the reason for his
leaving Pretoria when duty seemed to de
mand his presence at the capital remains
as deep a mystery as ever and must so
remain, probably for another week. The
ex-Consul's appearance was awaited at
the State Department with interest. Just
before noon Representative Taylor, of
whose Congressional district Mr. Macrum
Is a resident, called at the department
and spent some time In conference with
Assistant Secretary Hill and was fol
lowed about half-past 3 o'clock by Mr.
Macrum, who came alone. Secretary Hay,
vrho had had an exhautslng day. had gone,
so the ex-Consul was obliged to pay
his respects to Dr. Hill. His stay was
shortâ about twenty minutes, perhapsâ
and he left Dr. Hill as much in the dark
as he had been before as to Mr. Macrum's
motive for leaving Pretoria. Nor did it
develop whether or not Mr. Macrum was
the bearer of any message from Kruger.

DULL YEAR IN THE

VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. s.â Advices
from Dawson to-day state that up to the
end of the year business In the Yukon
capital had been dlscouraglngly dull, al
though work oh the claims was progress
ing well. Up to December 20 the weather
had been so mild that but little gravel
had been got out, although after that date
this Impediment of temperature was re
moved, the thermometer dropping to 40
degrees below zero and ranging as low as
67. There is now a good showing on the
dumps. - Â¦ . > .-â¢Â¦-.
The Dawson banks estimate $21,000,000*
will be taken out this- season. From 2008
to 3000 Dawsonltes are arranging to leave
on the first boats down the river In the
spring for the Nome fields. At White
Horse the â¢ police have under arrest two
men suspected of the murder of Clayton,
Relfe and Olson on the trail.
The Dawson fire destroyed only eight
buildings, occupying half a block. As the
buildings were all flimsy structures, lined
with cotton. It is considered surprising
that the fire was confined to so few build
ings. Dawson has a well-equipped Fire
Department with a. force of thirty paid
men. The fire engines are housed on the
Ice of the river, where the water can most
readily be obtained.
YOUNG LADY'S NARROW ESCAPE

William A. Brady his former 25 per cent
Interest in the Coney Island organization
It cannot have the coming championsliip
heavy-weight battle between James J.
Corbett and James J. Jeffries. Brady, wh>
Is Jeffries* manager. Is responsible for
this statement.
Brady's declaration was made subse
quent to a statement by George Considine,
Corbett's manager, in which Considine
accused Brady of being Interested In the
offer of the National Athletic Club of San
Francisco, and declared that Brady's de
sire to have Jeffries fight In California
was because the climate of the Golden
State favored the champion. Jeffries'
manager admitted to me that he had an
Interest In the National Athletic Club,
but said Consldlne's other statement was
absurd. â¢ â¢ .
"My position in the National Athletic
Club," said Brady, "is precisely the same
as Consldlne's toward the Broadway
Athletic Club. It is a business proposition
with me. Corbett would be sure of fatr
treatment In tho National Club's- areua,
and Tom O'Rourke, who Is a stockholder
In the Broadway Athletic Club, has
coached his own men in its arena."
Brady Intimated that If Corbett insisted
on Coney Island as the battle ground he

STROMO IS
LANDED AT
LONG ODDS
One of the Surprises of the
Day at Oaklandâ Choices
Do Well.
Those racegoers who take an occa
sional shot, at the moon brought down a
big bird at Oakland track yesterday, when
Stromo .tiptoed in at odds ranging arw
where from 50 to 100 to L The lumbering
gelding had been taking kindly to his
morning work, and as he was meeting a
hunch of cheap ones the books sold quite
a number of pasteboards on the outsider.
Fauntleroy, the colored boy, had the
mount, and blessed with all kinds of luck
paesed Coda In the stretch, winning
easily. The form players backed Mary
Kinsella, and had Vittitoe not been cut
off on a half dozen occasions they would
undoubtedly have experienced the pleas
ure of getting in line.
Three favoritesâ Vioris, Matt Hogan and
Scotch Plaidâ took purses, the ring laying
good prices against each. The track was
"dead," the time In most of the events
being slow.
The white with purple cap of Bam Par
ker, the Hawaiian turfman, was borne to
the front by Vioris in the opening sprint.
The mare closed favorite over Espirando
and nine other ordinary platers, and with
Jenkins up scored in clever fashion. The
second choice disposed of Senora Caesar
quite as handily for the place.
"Boots" Durnell annexed another purse
with Matt Hogan, the willowy Wagner
pelding:. in- the five and one-half furlong
dash which followed. An 11 to 5 choice,
he showed first in the stretch, and won
nodding from Xance O'Xeil, with Mission
a close third.
Rollick, the chestnut youngster from
the Burns & Waterhouse stable was
bowled out at odds of 9 to 20 In the two
year-old spin. Scotch Belle, al2 to 1 shot,
with Henry In the saddle, outfooted the
favorite without apparent effort. Gaylon
Brown, which this time broke away In
front, ran third.
Magrane's sprinter Montgomery made
short work of Midlove in the six furlong
number. The smart filly was installed a
pronounced favorite, and after leading to
the stretch quit badly. Montgomery,
which had been trailing, won galloping
from Monrovia. The other staters were
out of their latitude.
Another ridiculously easy win was that
of Scotch Plaid in the last event of the
day, a mile selling run. Nine to five was
laid against Billy Cahill's useful horse,
and he finished at the wire slowed down
to a Jog. over two lengths before Wyom
ing. Henry finished third on Los Me
danos, a 12 to 1 shot. 2:â '.,'..
Track Notes.
The stewards of the California Jockey
Club will meet this evening, when the
case of Tommy Burns will be taken up.
Martin Xathanson of Chicago mingled
with the crowd at the track yesterday.
Mr. Xathanson Is secretary of the Har
lem Racing Association and will receive
entries for the 'stake events at that track
as well as those at Lakeside.
Al Martin is the latest recruit to the
ranks of gold seekers heading for Nome.
His string, consisting of Lost Girl, P A
Finnegan and a half brother to the
tirst-named mare, will be sold at auction
next Saturday.
Frank McMahon, who has not met
with the best of luck lately, had a fairly
good bet down on his horse Stromo.
Vittitoe seems timid ever since his ac
cident last summer, and the youngster
would 'save himself a world of adverse
comment If he would confine his riding
to small fields. Then perhaps his nerve
and confidence might return.

jack McDonald.
SOLDIER" Phil Green and Jack Mc-
Donald are In splendid condition
for their twenty-round go to-mor
row night before the Columbia Ath
letic Club. For the pa.-a two weeks both
pugilists have trained faithfully for the
contest, and when they step into the ring
they will be fit to go the distance without
iistretsing themselves. Kach man is so
:onndcnt of his ability to win that he has
!>acked himself to the extent of a $uW side
set. tt
Great interest is being manifested in the
natch, and this bespeaks a large at
[Â¦endance on Wednesday night. The Co
.umbia Club .nuuiagcment has completed
Â»rrar.Â£ements to comfortably seat a large
:rowd. There will' be no. delay 'in bring
ng off the fight. Unless serious objection
,s made J. ilcGinley, the club's official
referee, will officiate in the ring. The
atter nas given entire satisfaction to the
followers of the sport by reason of his
square decisions and his discountenanc
:iÃ fake fighting.
The men will weigh in at 154 pounds,
md it is stated on the authority of the
?!ub directors that both are within the
tveipht limit and in fine fettle. Green will
irobably* be the favorite by reason of hi&
;iatt experience in the ring. He has pre
pared for his fight at Blanken's Six-mile
(louse and has had such clever boxers as
lack O'Brien, "Crockey" Boyle and
Jimmy Lawler to contend against. He is
;aid to have improved immensely and was
jever in better condition for a contest.
Dn the other hand, McDonald may lack
Green's experience, but he has always
Â¦>rcved a dangerous man In the ring. He
lit* like a heavy-weight, can take a good
>eatlr.g and is dangerous at any stage of
:he game. He will be heavily backed by
'ellow employes of the Union Iron Work 3,
Â»ho believe they have a world-beater in
he young man. Their betting may switch
the odds and McDonald may be on the
long end. The young shipbuilder has
trained near Harbor View and looks lik<Â»
a two-year-o'd, anxious for the starting
=ipnal.
Joe Bf-11 ar,<3 "Kid" Johnson will meet
n a preliminary contest fit 130 pounds, as
will also "Hilly" Sprinsrfiv-ld and Charles
rhurFtrin at 14"> pounds. The latter boxes
are clever amateurs, who have local 'rep
utations, and there is every Indication
that they will furnish good appetizers for
he dessert which follows. They will each
hattle ten rounds for a decision, money

Coursing Park has such a high class mid
winter stake been offered to the public as
that drawn in Pythian Castle last night,

difficult for the talent to pick the winner
of the stake. Queen Kilp, owned by S. V.
O'Neil. has never been seen at the local
parks, but has won a number of stakes in
Los Angeles and has shown well in Kan
sas. The running of T.J. Cronin's Dai3y
Dale and Thorndale will be watched -with
interest, as they belong to the same litter
as Vendel . and Vlken, who divided each
stake they have been in. Daisy Maid is
also a promising youngster. She is a Ut
ter sister of Whltehead, a stake- winner.
The prizes offered are as follows: "Win
ner, $o0: runner up. $20; third. $20; next
three, $12 50 each; next seven. $3 each and
next fourteen, |$2 50 each. The probable

ceived a few days ago by a particular
friend of McGrath, the pair will reach the
city by the 9th inst In his letter the
famous little trainer gives some inside
information as to what led to the defeat
of McConnell at the hands of Smith, the
mysterious. In his characteristic way
McGrath tays:
*I arrived here with Dave Sullivan. He fights
with Jack Hamilton to-night. I have been
around with Mike Lucy all day and we have
Just come in from a sleieh ride.
There is no end to my hard luck. ThÂ« very
first minute of the opening round Smith butted
Frank and broke his nose and the blood choked
him all through the fight. He was so handi
capped that he could not do anything but
"Mall" all through the fight, and when he was
knocked out he was standing still as a mill
pond. His footwork gave out. Now you know
that If he could stay there that long what
would be have done if the accident had not
happened. You know a referee never sees any
thluff when a fellow from our town gets fouled.
Smith did everything to Frank but bite him
and I think had he done that It would have
beÂ«n all right.
We will start for the coast Â«o that we will
arrive about the 9th Inst. to challenge the win
ner of the Neil-O'Brien fight.
When McConnell arrives he- will be
gratified to learn that his fathar ha*

STANFORD'S
NINE TO PLAY
ON SATURDAY
BASEBALL enthusiasts, especially
those of both sexes who are Inter
ested In the forthcoming serle3 of
games between the University of
California and Stanford, will have an op
portunity of securing a line on the car
dinal aggregation on Saturday next, when
they will meet the- Fireman's Fund team
at Recreation Park.
On that day C. B. Strohn, captain of
Stanford's nine, will line up his strongest
players and prove their worth to defend
the cardinal colors on the diamond. It is
probable that Strohn will occupy his old
position at second, as in Horn Coach Mur
phy has found a good man to act as back
stop. Lanagan has even greater speed
than last year and better control of the
ball. He will in all probability occupy
the pitcher's box.
Strohn, this year's captain, haa been
playing baseball for many years. He
comes from Los Angeles, where he played
first base for the Tufts-Lyons team the
year it won the Examiner tournament.
He prepared for Stanford at the Univer
sity of California. He is a student In
history and philosophy of the class of 'V).
"Pete" Kaarsberg, who will captain the
blue and gold nine, is so well known In
college athletics that he . hardly needs
mention. It Is sufficient to pay that he
has pitched for his team during the pabt
two seasons and has also played fullback
on the victorious 'Varsity eleven. H<t was
elected to his position by reason of his
ability on the diamond and his great pip
ularitv. With "Peter, Peter. Stanford
eater, in the box the members of his co"
lege are confident that their team will do
its utmost to bring tho pennant over to
the classic shades of Berkeley.

Discovery. This remedy is remarkable
for its power to purify the blood. It
absolutely eliminates the corrupting ele-

rich. It increases the action of the
blood-making, glands, and so increases
the quantity of pure blood supplied to
the body.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
However accurately the Republican conferees represent Governor Taylor, or how necessary the latter's acquiescence is
necessary to the carrying out of the plans agreed upon to-night can only be determined by the events of the next twenty
four hours. It Is probable that the Republican policy was materially Influenced by the following telegram:
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 4. 1900.â Hon. W. S. Taylor: The unanimous sentiment here is that you are wrong in pre
venting the Legislature from meeting, and that you should submit the disputed questions to the civil courts. Federal assist
ance cannot be given you on your requisition so long as the Legislature is in session or can be convened. There is no
doubt but it can be convened if you will permit. The Democrats Intend that if any violence occurs you shall be the ag
gTessor. You will by forcible resistance alienate all who formerly sympathized with your case. No assistance. An
swer. W. J. DEBOE."
] issued revoking the meeting at London,
| and that it would proceed as originally
| intended by him. He denied in the most
emphatic manner that there had been any
intention on the part of the Republican
party to abandon the London session. This
j was a bombshell to many of the Dcmo
j cratic members of the Legislature, who,
j acting on the advice of their attorneys,
had left the city Saturday night and o:i
Sunday morning in order to be away from
the capital in case it was decided by Gov
ernor Taylor to convey them to London
for the purpose of helping out a quorum.
They had left the city as directed, and
early this morning a large number of
them were told to return, as everything
had been settled and an agreement
reached which would allow the Legisla
ture to occupy the chambers In the Capi
tol. They came in from all directions
and on every train, and by noon fully
thirty of them had arrived. They knew
nothing of the situation except what had
been contained in messages received by
them, and these were found to be mis
leading when they were confronted on
their arrival in Frankfort by the state
ment of Governor Taylor. They imme
diately began preparations to leave the
city, and at nightfall Democratic mem
bers were as scarce as they were in the
morning before the first train arrived.
Late in the evening word came that an
adjustment favorable to the Democrats
might be made at the Louisville confer
ence, which was expected, however, to
last through the greater part of the night.
By this time the Democratic members
were pinning their faith once more to
legal advice and were beyond the reach
of reassuring telegrams.
To-day in Frankfort was county court
day, which comes on the first Monday of
every month, and brings to the city any
where from 2000 to oOuO outsiders. The
niftnber to-day was smaller than usual,
for many assurances had gone forth from
here that there was a strong possibility
of trouble, and nobody without special
business should take it upon himself to
come to town. The crowd, however, was
sufficiently large to throng the streets
and this, coupled with the fact that the
Democrats were returning to the city In
numbers, and that during the morning
at least political excitement ran high.
Induced Adjutant General Collier to make
more ample preparations foV the suppres
sion of possible trouble than he had done
at any previous time. A three-Inch rifled
cannon was brought from the armory on
the hillside and placed in â¢ the Capitol
grounds, pointing directly down St. Clair
street. Ammunition was placed beside it
and beside the Gatllng guns which were
on both sides of it, comman^.ng the ap
proaches to the Capitol building from the
southwest and southeast.
The State Board of Election Commis
sioners met to-day in the Capitol Hotel
for a short session and then decided to
make an attempt to visit the office of
the commission In the Capitol building.
They reached there after considerable
trouble with the sentries and promptly
adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning to meet in the Capitol Hotel.
Although every leader of the Democratic
party is away from Frankfort, it is un
derstood and believed by such of those
who remain here that the Democratic
party, in case of a failure to agree with
the Republicans in Louisville, will at once
proceed to- organize a State government.
In order to do this with the least possible
delay. It is necessary that t7ie contests
for the minor positions on the State
ticket shall be determined immediately.
Governor Beckham has at the present
time no Secretary of State, no Treasurer
and no Auditor. It will not be possible
of course, for him to transact State busi
ness until these officers have been seateo.
and it is with the object of facilitating
matters In this respect that the Election
Commissioners are now at work. All
these contests are little more than mat
ters of form, every one of them resting
upon the same evidence which caused the
Legislature to -decide the Goebel-Taylor
contest in favor of the former. The con
tests will be decided by the Election Com
missioners, and their decision is already a
foregone conclusion.
Among the arrivals to-day was Colonel
Thomas C. Campbell of â¢ New York, and
formerly of Cincinnati. It Is stated that
he had previously been working on the
contest as counsel for the dead contest
ant. He was in conference to-day and
to-night with the friends of Governor
Goebel. including the brothers, Arthur
and Justus. It is stated that Colonel
Campbell is assisting in working up vig
orous prosecution, and that there has al
ready been much information gathered
by detectives on which arrests are ex
pected soon.
LOUISVILLE,' Feb. s.â Acting on the 1
understanding reached last night in
Frankfort by the representatives of
the rival Governors, the Democratic
managers succeeded In reaching most
of the Democratic members of the
Legislature who were expected to at
tend a session of the General Assembly
in this city to-day and got them headed
for Frankfort. No session of the Legis
lature was held here, but an informal
meeting was held at Frankfort by the
Democratic members, who, without
transacting any business, adjourned un
til to-morrow. Meanwhile Speaker Trim
ble. President of tho Senate L. H. Carter,
Clerks Cromwell and Leigh and Sergeant
at Arms Haley remained in this city
awaiting the result of the conference,
which was expected to bring some order
out of the present condition of affairs.
They remained here over night, but can
easily reach Frankfort to-morrow morn-
Ing In time for a session if that course is
thought wise.
The day was a busy one for Governor
Beckham. Arising early at his headquar
ters at Selbach's Hotel, he spent the first
hours of the day with close personal
friends In his apartments at the hotel.
At 10:30 o'clock he started for the resi
dence of Colonel James Fetter, to see' his
mother, Mrs. Julia Beckham who camo
down from Chicago this morning. It was
the first meeting between mother and son
since the latter had become Governor
Each was greatly affected. After return
ing to his hotel numerous conferences oc
cupied the remainder of the day. A large
number of telegrams and letters of con
gratulation were received by the Governor
to-day. Among them was the following:
CULPEPPER. Va.. Feb. s.â Governor Beck
ham: We deplore the death of Governor Goebel.
Offer 900 men to see Justice meted out. Answer
C. E. SMITH.
Colonel Virginia State Guard.
A good deal of interest centered about
Adjutant General Castleman and his new
National Guard. The general was not at
all well and was confined to his bed all
day. Recruiting for the battalion of the
First Regiment, which it had been decided
to raise, was actively carried on, but be
yond this there was not much doing in
this branch of the Democratic State gov
ernment, the more peaceful trend of
events having checked preparations of
this kind. The Governor, however, ex
pressed a . purpose to avail himself, in
case it should become necessary, of the
services of separate companies which have
been or are being organized In a number
of Kentucky towns to support the Demo
cratic State officers. In addition arrange
ments have been made to utilize city po
lice and deputy sheriffs If they should be
needed.
LONDON, Ky., Feb. 6.â There was no
display of animosity among the citizens of
London when it became a certainty to-day
that the Legislature was to convene here.
There is but one Democratic member
here. Senator Hayes, from Jefferson
County, and he Is of the anti-Goebel fol
lowing. Altogether twenty-seven Repre
sentatives and nine Senators have arrived
There is one more train to arrive before
to-morrow noon and possibly the number
may be increased before the time for con
vening. When the citizens learned this
afternoon that no Democratic members
were aboard the train disappointment was
freely expressed.
The company of militia from Barbours
ville stood at attention before the Laurel
County Seminary building, the London
home of the Legislature, when the mem
bers walked past from the railroad sta
tion to the hotels. The presence of the sol
diers did not provoke any comment, but
was placidly accepted as a part of the
regular legislative programme. The town
has been tilled with mountaineers all day
partly owing to the fact that the Laurel
County Circuit Court began its winter
term to-day, but more especially that
"court day" is the regular day for the
mountaineers to come to town to swap
horses and make purchases.
The Republican members of the Senate
and House held separate and secret cau
cuses to-night In the Circuit Court room
the Senators occupying one side of the
room and the Representatives the other
The caucuses occupied but short time'
Both caucuses appointed committees to
draft resolutions of respect upon the deith
of Governor Goebel. -.... }
The following resolutions of respect will
be submitted by both houses at the open
ing session of the Legislature to-morrow:
Whereas, Senator Goebel, an honored mem
ber of the Senate of Kentucky, died on the third
day of February, 1900, his death belne caused
by assassination; therefore be It
Resolved by the Senate of Kentucky, That we
deprecate and deplore the serious crime which
caused his death, believing that assassination
Is an utterly Indefensible and cowardly and
heinous offense against the laws of God and
man. That in honor of our late colleague the
Senate shall stand adjourned until Thursday
February S. 1900. '
As far as can be learned the two houses
"T* OUISVILLE, Ky.. Feb. 6.â lf the a greement drawn up last night at the conference of the representatives of the
I Republican and Democratic administrations, held at the Gait House in this city, is accepted and carried out the
I Etrife which has rent Kentucky from end to end for the past two weeks will be ended. The agreement was reached
J .shortly after midnight and arrangements were Immediately made to have it drawn up and signed. This was slow
work, however, and it was after 2 o'clock when the conferees separated.
The Democrats gained nearly every point they contended for, and the Republican representatives, Lieutenant
Governor John Marshall, General Dan Lindsey and Attorney David Farleigh, gave assurances that the agreement would
be accepted by Governor Taylor to-morrow.
The agreement provides that In order to leave no question as to the title of William Goebel and J. C. "W. Beckham
to the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, respectively, the General Assembly shall pass a resolution In Joint
assembly validating the acts on that subject since the Legislature has been prevented by troops from holding Its regular
sessions at Frankfort. As soon as the Legislature does this Beckham's title to the office of Governor is not to be ques
tioned. The Democrats grant immunity to Governor Taylor and his associates from prosecution for treason, usurpation
of office or contempt of court for what has been done since the shooting of Goebel. These matters are to be held in
Rbeyance until next Monday. The Republican Legislature Is to be withdrawn from London immediately and no filibus
tering or other attempt of this character is to be resorted to by the Republicans to obstruct the carrying out of this
agreement in the Legislature.
The Democrats suggest that in view of the great crowds expected in Frankfort during the Goebel funeral ceremonies
the soldiers should be withdrawn. The Republicans ask that an adequate guard be left to protect Governor Taylor and bis
associates. It was finally agreed to leave to General Daniel Lindsay, one of tho Republican conferees, the decision as to
how many troops should be left to prevent a clash as a result at the Goebel funeral, the Republicans to begin at once the
withdrawal of the troops from Frankfort. It was agreed that the Board of Election Commissioners, sitting as a contest
board, should be allowed to meet at Frankfort without molestation, the Democrats agreeing that no summary action be
taken on these contests and that nothing be done without due hearing of evidence and argument.
The Republicans asked that some provision for the repeal or modification of the Goebel law be included in the agree
ment. The Democrats agreed that to two leading Republicans and two leading Democrats should be left the matter of sug
gesting changes in the Goebel law believed to be wise.
The acceptance of this agreement by the principals is the only element of uncertainty now remaining in the situation.
Naturally there was no objection from the Democrats and the attitude of Governor Taylor will certainly be known to-mor
row.
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. s.â Governor
Taylor to-night made a distinct and
positive offer to submit the merits,
of his claim to the gubernatorial
chair Qf Kentucky to any three
fair minded men in the world, these
three men to be selected by the United
States Supreme Court. He will allow them
to arbitrate the case and will abide by
their decision. This announcement h-s
made to a correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press nt 6 o'clock to-night in his
cfSce Â«n the executive building. The dec
laration made by Governor Taylor regard-
Ing arbitration was at once wired by the
Associated Press correspondent to Lttu
ter.ant Governor John Marshall and At
torney David W. Fairlelgh, Republican
members of the political conference held
to-night at Louisville.
Chaotic !s the only word that will de
scribe the political situation as it existed
to-day at Frankfort. This condition atoso
not bo much from anything that was done
by either side as from the countless
ctortes and rumors that were spread
broadcast during the day.
Early In the morning it was positively
asserted by the Democrats and confirmed
by a few Republicans that the legislative
session in London was about to be called
oil. The Democrats claimed to hffxj hal
the highest possible assurance that Gov
ernor Taylor would take such action, and
that the next session of the Legislature
â¢would be held In Frankfort In the Capitol
building to-morrow morning. Governor
Taylor late in the morning, however, al
tered the situation entirely by declaring
to a correspondent that no order had been

MANILA. Feb. s.â Brigadier General
Kobbe's expedition in the islands of Lu
zon, Ley te and Saraar has occupied per
manently and garrisoned nine towns with
the Forty-third and Forty-seventh regi
ments. This has placed on the market
170,000 bales of hemp. A thousand insur
gents armed with rifles and over 5000
armed with wooden swords, bows and'ar
rows were encountered during the entire
trip. The troops , killed seventy-five na
tives, eleven of whom had rifles. The
others were villagers armed with wooden
swords. The American loss was one man
killed and nine men wounded. The Ameri
cans captured $9000 in gold, the enemy's
money, and forty mu2zle-loading brass
cannon. At Calbagog and Samar the en
emy evacuated the towns, the Americans
chasing and scattering them to the moun
tains.
At Catbalogan, Lukban. the Tagalog
general fired the place with kerosene Just
before the Americans landed and then
fought for - two hours with cannon and
rifles from the hills encircling the town.
When the Filipinos were driven out the
Americans did. their best to save the town,
fighting the fire for several hours. Thirty
stone and seventy other houses, half the
business portion of the place, were con
sumed. The soldiers prevented the fire
from spreading. The next day Major Al
len, with three companies of the Forty
third Regiment, pursued Lukban to the
mountain fastnesses and thence to the
coast town, whither Lukban was heading
in hopes of escape. Lukban, by taxing
the natives, has accumulated $100,000 in
gold. His capture is probable.
At Takloban, island of Ley te, the enemy
evacuated the town and the Americans
pursued them to the hills. Several fleeing
non-combatants were killed, including
three women.
At Palo, seven miles distant, the enemy
was found entrenched and resisted. . Lieu
tenant Johnston, with twelve scouts of
the Forty-third Regiment, drove out 13tÂ»
of the enemy and captured the town.
The insurgents in these towns were
mostly Visayans, who had been impressed
into the service of the Tagalog leaders
from Luzon. The Visayans appear indif
ferent or sullenly antagonistic to th*
American occupation. The Tagalog chiefs
Influenced them against us. but when they
perceive we are much more powerful than
the Tagalogs and Intended to maintain
garrisons in order to open the islands to
commerce, it is believed, the rebel party
will lose Its popularity. The Americans
are gladly accepted by the inhabitants,
who are daily returning to the towns.
There is a rush of commercial vessels
from Manila to these new ports.

TAYLOR'S PLAN TO
SETTLE THE TROUBLE
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 5.â "1 will
leave the settlement of this controversy
to any three fair-minded men on earth,"
said Governor Taylor in an interview
this afternoon. "Let three men In whom
the people have confidence be selected by
the United States Supreme Court, and I
will, with all confidence, submit the case
to their arbitration, and will cheerfully
abide by their decision in the matter. I
was elected Governor of the State of
Kentucky, not by a majority of 2200 but
by a majority of 40,0u0, and on that de
cision of the people I propose to stand.
"No acts ot the Legislature in regard
to my case have been legal because no
meeting of the Legislature has been held
according to law. The constitution pro
vides that the Legislature shall consist
of two bodies, the Senate and the lower
House, and shall sit at the seat of gov
ernment. That seat of government Is at
Frankfort, unless the Governor convenes
the Legislature at some other point. I
have convened the Legislature at Lon
don, where It will continue to sit for the
present at least, and no action by the
Democratic members of the Legislature
can therefore have any legal standing.
"Another thing, I have never been
given formal notice that I had been de
posed by act of Legislature. When such
notice of the act of the Democratic
members of the Legislature is given me
I will either Ignore It or veto it.
Governor Taylor then stated that he
was willing "to leave the settlement 'of
the controversy to three men selected by
the United States Supreme Court.
"The case of the election board Is dif
ferent from - that of the Legislature,"
continued Governor Taylor. "The law
specially provides a room for them In
the Stato building, where they shall hold
their sessions. Of course, I was declared
elected by the former board, so the pres
ent board has nothing to do with my
case. The courts enjoined tho gentlemen
appointed by me to fill the vacancies
caused by the resignations of Commis
sioners Pryor and Ellis from taking their
seats on the board, and it is useless to
submit arguments to the present board
when at least two members of that board
have already committed themselves in
regard to the contests before them. It
is simply a farce to bring the cases of
the other State officers before the
board."

CONUNDRUMSâ A. E., City. This de

answer asked, but it draws the line at
answering conundrums.
IRRIGATION INTERESTS.
THE interests of irrigation will be advanced by
the settlement of other questions which have
caused delay in adopting a definite storage
policy for the saving of flood waters. There is a halt
all along the line to wait for the settlement of the
range leases in the semi-arid region for the use of
stockmen. The proceeds of such leases are to be di
vided with the States, to be by them applied to irri
gation purposes. It is very desirable that the lease
hold policy be at once applied in order that there
may be an accurate measure of the amount it will
produce for irrigation. When such measure is taken
the people will know how much capital they must
seek elsewhere for the storage of storm waters, and
will determine where it is to be sought, and how.
Until the leasehold question is brought down out of
the air it is a real obstruction to progress in irriga
tion.
The leasing of ranges for cattle on the public do
main is a big enough question to stand alone and
win on its merits. Since the stock increased and the
forage has been decreasing there has been a lawless
condition on the ranges for which any kind of law
would be an agreeable substitute. The cattlemen
have been arrayed against the sheepmen, and there
has been between them a condition of actual war,
involving the destruction of much property and a loss
of life. There have been scores of sub-feuds, sheep
men against sheepmen and cattlemen against cattle
men, contesting for a season's use of rapidly disap
pearing forage. As a result there has been not only
a condition of lawlessness, while the gentle shepherd
has gone armed like a marauder, but the total value
of that part of the public domain adapted to grazing
has dwindled year by year, through overstocking and
destruction of its natural grasses.
The fault was with Congress and a disposition is
now shown to correct it. If a law be passed which
properly regulates the leases, is respectful of actual
stockowners and of the small rancher's privilege to
control enough abutting commons for his domestic
stock or small herd, and which prevents speculation
in leaseholds, a most grateful change will appear.
Then the leaseholder will be interested in renewing
the exhausted grasses of his range and the agrostolo
gists of the Agricultural Department will find their
most useful occupation in protecting the country's
beef food supply, by assisting in re-seeding to the
plants which supply forage.
It is proposed to make the tenure of the leaseholds
ten years, with the privilege of two renewals, a total
of thirty years. It is safe to say that at the end of
that period the Government will own grazing lands
more valuable than they were when ranged only by
the buffalo, elk, deer and antelope, and the beef food
supply of the country will be in better condition than
now.
Our Western members should see the importance
of united action "to secure such legislation, and all

it, to clear the ground for the specific interest which
they represent.

ANOTHER CO-OPERATION PROBLEM.
ONCE more the rapidly expanding practice of
co-operation has given rise to a problem
which confuses business and perplexes busi
ness men. The new issue has arisen in San Jose, the
home of the co-operative fruit unions, but this time
the intent of the movement is not to eliminate from
traffic middlemen who live at a distance, but mer
chants who live in San Jose itself; hence the com
plexity of the problem.
It appears the students of the State Normal School
in that city have combined to form a co-operative
book store, with the object of obtaining their books
at something like wholesale rates. The success of
the undertaking will mean a considerable loss to the
booksellers of the city, who have in the past had the
patronage of the 700 students of the institution. So
large a trade, of course, is not to be surrendered
without a struggle to retain it, and consequently the
book dealers are striving as best they can to defeat
the project.
The issue, as it is reported to have presented itself
to the merchants, is more important than shows at
first thought. The movement toward co-operation
is so far reaching in its influence that each new suc
cess attained by it leads to movements in similar di
rections elsewhere. Thus it is feared that if the stu
dents of the Normal make a profitable venture of their
undertaking it will not be .long before the entire
school population will, in the various larger centers,
combine to obtain books and other school require
ments on the co-operative plan. That will mean a
very heavy loss, indeed, to" many booksellers, and the
San Jose merchants are said to be engaged in an ef
fort to arouse the trade throughout the State, and
particularly in this city, to assist in the opposition to
the movement.
It is not worth while to inquire into the merits of
the controversy so far as it affects San Jose alone.
It is reasonable to assume that the book dealers of the
city have not made unjust charges for books supplied
to the students. In fact, it would be impossible for
them to do so even if they formed a combination
among themselves to fix school prices, for San Jose
is so near to San Francisco and Oakland that the out
side competition would soon bring prices down to
the rightful level. It is, therefore, probable the un
dertaking of the students is simply a part of that wide
sweeping movement toward co-operation which is
going on all over the civilized world. It is in that
light it will have to be considered; and when con
sidered so, it is not easy to see how any antagonism
can defeat it if it be properly managed. â¢
It is easy to denounce such combinations; easy to
speak of them as trusts, and declare them to be in
jurious to the general welfare; but the fact remains
that co-operationÂ»is the most potent of the new eco
nomic forces of our time. It shows itself in a thou
sand forms, some good and some bad, some wise and
some foolish. Blunders are committed in its name,
and many unscrupulous things have been done by
avaricious or aggressive persons in carrying out some
of its enterprises, but it grows in spite of all. The
merchants are, of course, justified in fighting the
Normal movement by selling books cheaper than the
students' store can sell them, but anything like a
banded combination against that particular venture

BALLOTING MACHINES IN NEW YORK.
SO satisfactory have been the results of voting
by balloting machines in various cities in New
York, it is now proposed to use the machines
in the metropolis itself for the elections of the coming
fall, and the Police Commissioners have the subject
under consideration. The State constitution provides
that "all elections by the citizens shall be by ballot,
or by such other method as may be prescribed by
law, provided that secrecy in voting be preserved."
That renders it legally possible for local option zo
be exercised in the matter, and hence the movement
toward machine voting goes on in New York by de
grees, one city or county following another, instead
of waiting for action by the State government.
In a review of the experiments with the machines
in that State, the New York Sun says: "A practical
test of a voting machine was made in April, 1898, at
a local election* in Lockport. At the general State
election of November, 1898, 7$ voting machines were
used, 73 in the city of Rochester and 2 in Utica. The
experiment was encouraging, for in November, 1899,
225 machines were used, 108 in Buffalo, 73 in Roch
ester, 26 in Utica, 10 in Ithaca, 5 in Albion, 2 in
Canisteo and 1 in Winfield. The test in Buffalo, a
large city of 60,000 electors, was trying, but it appears
to have been very satisfactory, judging from the de
termination of the public authorities there to adhere
to machines."
It would appear from the record that the tests have
been sufficiently numerous and sufficiently varied to
justify the conclusion that the machines are a large
improvement over the old system. Those used in
the different cities in New York are said to be some
what similar in the principle of construction to the
cash registers and railway annunciators with which
the public is familiar. The advantages resulting are
said to be: First, celerity of voting and counting;
second, the elimination of fraud from the count; third,
the freedom from ambiguous or defective ballots;
fourth, the reduction in the number of election offi
cers, required and a consequent diminution of ex
pense; and, finally, a greater convenience for voters.
According to the reports, the duties of election
officers where the. machines are used are merely per
functory, as the machines register the votes and count
them automatically. The speed attained by them is
remarkable. It is said that in Rochester, at the first
trial of the system, the returns from all the voting
districts in the city were at headquarters in thirty
nine minutes. In Buffalo, at the last election, they
were in within seventy-seven minutes after the polls
were closed, and rapid tabulation of the results was
secured by the use of eighteen adding machines â a
further extension of the system. of substituting me
chanical methods for those of canvassers.
Such being the reports from the smaller cities, a
good deal of interest will be felt throughout the coun
try in the investigations now being made in the city
of New York. It requires something like $500,000 to
defray the expenses of an election in that city, and if
a trial be made with the machines this fall and the re
sults are as good as they are said to have been else
where, it will not be long before the machines will
be in general use in all progressive States.
WAR AND JINGOISM.
DXE of the lessons we may learn to our profit
from the British at this time is the rapidity
with which the jingo spirit develops in time of
war even among a people whose natural instincts are
more commercial than military. At the time of the
Hague conference the British people as a rule were
loud in proclaiming their devotion to peace, but some
of the very men who were foremost in professing
such devotion have taken the stump for war and are
talking as vehemently as Roosevelt himself of the
blessings of the strenuous life.
Dr. Conan Doyle, for example, in a speech at the
Authors' Club in London a few days ago, is reported
to have declared himself a convert to the jingo creed
that wars are beneficial. He is quoted as having said:
''Some eight months ago I took the chair at a peace
meeting, but I wish now to abjure that error. I have
Eecn more positive virtue in this country during the
last few months than I saw during the previous forty
Another illustration of the same jingo tendency is
to be seen in the quotations which the advocates of
war are bringing from the books of the great writers
â¢whose genius has conferred luster upon the Victorian
age. Thus from Ruskin's '"Crown of Wild Olive"
there is quoted a passage which runs thus:
'"When I tell you that war is the foundation of all
the arts I mean also that it is the foundation of all
tlie high virtues and faculties of men. It is very
Etrange to me. to discover this, and very dreadful â
but I saw it to be quite an undeniable fact." Further
on the idea is amplified: "I found, in brief, that all
great nations learnt their truth of word and strength
of thought in war; that they were nourished in war
and wasted by peace; taught by war and deceived by
peace; trained by war and betrayed by peace; in a
word, that they were born in war and expired in
So loud have become these voices shouting for war
that the Westminster Gazette recently argued that a
conscription in Great Britain would be a desirable
thing, because it would result in putting into the fir
ing line a good many men who will be inveterate
jingoes so long as they can stay at home and let some
one else do the fighting. The Gazette points out that
in Germany and France, where conscription is <in
force, there are by no means so many clamorous war
advocates as in Great Britain and the United States,
and from that fact it concludes that a conscription
which brings all classes of citizens into the army in
clines them to be more conservative than they would
be otherwise.
The lesson for us lies in the demonstration that
jingoism grows by what it feeds on. When we once
enter upon the path of imperialism we shall develop
a belief that the wars to which imperialism leads are
in the nature of benefits." There will be an increased
tendency toxard militarism, and things which we now
regard with abhorrence will become subjects of a
boastful pride.

LOS ANGELES TIMES.
The action of the Republican caucus at Sacramento last night in nominat
ing the Hon. Thomas R. Bard of Ventura County for the high and honorable
office of United States Senator is a delightful outcome to what has heretofore
been a most distressing state of affairs in this State. Mr. Bard is a man of high
character of splendid standing In the community and of excellent attainments.
In the entire list of candidates that have been balloted for in the caucus at the
present session, and that were voted for in the regular session last year, none
comes more nearly being the ideal Senatorial candidate than Is the distinguished
gentleman who was, on yesterday, so handsomely honored by the representatives
of his party and by the people of this glorious commonwealth.
FRESNO REPUBLICAN.
As the original Bard paper the Republican may be pardoned for a little feel
ing of especial satisfaction at the selection of Thomas R. Bard by the Republi
can Senatorial caucus last night and the practical guarantee of his election
when the formal ballot is taken next Tuesday. However, the gratification of the
respectable people of the entire State will be unbounded. From a trembling hope,
that it might escape disgrace California has changed to a trfnmphant proclama
tion that it has won honor; that the combined efforts of every element of cor
ruption and degradation in politics, have come to nothing, and that instead the
State Is about tÂ» select to represent it in the highest legislative council in the
world a man whose election will confer as much honor on the State as on hlm

By all means let It be Thomas R. Bard, and it is not strange that we should
have advocated his election during the regular session, and the Republicans of
this town entirely ignoring the really clean candidate of Ventura. Again, last
Monday in connection with the Republican mass meeting, we stated that Santa
Barbara Republicans did not want Burns because he is deemed too' unprincl
nled and neither wanted Thomas R. Bard because he is a man of sterling prin
ciple's We have been acquainted with Mr. Bard for thirty years and know him
to be a strictly honorable man, and hence in every sense a fit man for the high
est position ln f the State.
Being liberal-minded In politics, it must not be charged against us that we
desire the election of Burns to the detriment of the Republican party of this
State; but we do desire a gentleman as Senatorial representative, and such is
Thomas R. Bard. . . ,

methods Is significant, and it is one which Republican leaders are bound to he:d.

The decision of the Republican caucus to support the Hon. Thomas R. Bard
for Senator is an agreeable solution of a very vexed question. So far there has
been nobody to object to Mr. Bard. This may have been owing in some degree
to the fact that he was not prominent in the contest until immediately before his
election but there could not have been much against him when the widely sun
dered factions opposing Colonel Burns so readily flocked â¢to his standard. Mr.
Bard is in public life in the best sense of the term. He is broadly and creditably

Hon. Thomas R. Bard, the party choice for United States Senator, we believe,

cient experience with co-operation to know what
limitations if any, should be placed upon the adoption
of it by any class of people. The Normal students,
however, are quite within their rights in following the
example of the fruit men, and the merchants must
submit to the inevitable.
CONGRESS should be impressed with the pol
icy of a pause in legislating as to the Spanish
islands.
An examination of the treaty of Paris demonstrates
the impolicy of haste in concluding very new and very
grave questions. The administration of Cuba and
Porto Rico has proved that conditions are certainly
made no worse by omitting statutory regulation,
while it is undeniable that a mass of information is
being gathered that will enable enlightened legisla
tion when it must be had. If this be true of a situa
tion that has been maintained since the 14th of Aug
ust, 1898, how much more must it be true of a situa
tion yet undeveloped in the Philippines?
In regard to the latter, Congress may easily make
a mistake that will have fatal results at home within
the next few months. So far no full and satisfactory
panorama of all the conditions in the Philippines has
been exhibited to the American people. Superficial
observers, who have not been in the islands' long
enough to get tanned by the vertical sun, have made
rhapsodical reports which are an unsubstantial basis
for legislation. Professional philanthropists have ex
ploited plans for applying a sentimental emulsion to
the situation. Religious enthusiasts have entered the
field with the olive branch in one hand and the plan
of salvation in the other. In this confusion of ideas
there is absolutely not a single square foot of bed
jeek upon which to plant legislation. Therefore Con
gress should let the matter alone. It should not com
mit the country to a policy which may soon have to
be changed in detail or entirely swept away.
The Republican party has interests at stake which
must not be imperiled, for they are the interests of
the country. The Administration must not be bur
dened with the execution of a Congressional plan
which will probably be a misfit, while fighting for its
life in a Presidential campaign. Issues are not arti
ficially manufactured. They grow out of the ever
changing conditions that ebb and flow.
The Bryanites are trying to make an issue on ex
pansion. No one who entertains sincere convictions
on that subject trusts them. It is patent that they
were ready to assault the Administration if it had
taken the side they now pretend to support. They
stand upon expediency and not upon principle. Their
position is unimportant unless it is made weighty by
a premature conclusion reached by Congress, with
out full knowledge of the situation upon which it at
tempts to legislate.
The Republican party has not spoken on the sub
ject through a national convention. The issue is not
formulated. It need not be until it is digested by pub
lic sentiment. There is no certainty that Senator
Foraker's bill is wise, or that it can be amended into
wisdom. The Republican party does not want to en
ter a Presidential campaign defending a legislative
interpretation of the constitution which the courts
may not sustain. Indeed, the party need not be put
in the position of defending anything. Its record for
four years, as written in revived industry, resusci
tated trade, wide-spreading prosperity, increased
wages, and the transfer of millions of workingmen
from the soup house to the factory, from the pauper
list to the payroll, requires no defense, and on that
record it should stand. It need not be compelled to
defend experimental and imperfect legislation. It
need not be forced into a position that will divert pub
lic attention and popular approval from the mighty
things it has done to what it may. be accused of in
tending to do. Â¦
Congress should pause. It should refrain from
experimental legislation. It should show the same
confidence in the President that the country has'
shown, and should not obscure the domestic issues
raised by its successful policy at home by the shadow
of issues raised abroad.

XH. SCHOOLS OF SHAKESPEARE
CRITICISM.
(Concluded.)
Shakespeare and the Romantic School
of Criticism.
The great literary revival of the latter
half of the eighteenth century produced
a school of criticism so sharply In con
trast with the classical school that It may
most fitly be characterized by the anti
thetical term romantic.
The movement had its origin in Ger
many, where such critics as Lesslng.
Goethe and Schlegel revolted against the
literary domination of the Franco-classic
principles of criticism. Against the
authority of Corneille and Voltaire they
Invoked the name of Shakespeare and set
themselves resolutely to establish the fact
that his plays were not only delightful in
themselves, but admirable as the products
of a master mind working along definite
principles of dramatic construction.
This note of revolt was soon caught up
in England, primarily by Coleridge, whose
blended poetic and philosophic powers
eminently fitted him to be the profoundest
and most sympathetic of Shakespearean
critics. He and his followers gave voice
to the romantic reaction against the cool,
common-sense criticism of an earlier gen
eration, and if at times they ran into ex
travagance, as when Coleridge preached
the doctrine of Shakespeare's infallibility
and upheld even his puns as the "emani
tions of genius," they nevertheless played
a most Important part In raising Shakes
peare's fame above the critical balance
scales wherein Pope and Johnson had
weighed It. Since Coleridge wrote and
spoke no Englishman at least has dared,
to sit In judgment on Shakespeare. The
task of later criticism has been a reverent
attempt to penetrate the poet's meaning,
illustrate his thought and discover If pos
sible the personality hidden behind his
work.
' Tet the eulogy of Coleridge was no
blind rhapsody of praise. We may say of
him, as Hazlitt did of Schlegel, that no
previous critic had shown either "the
same enthusiastic admiration of Shakes
peare's genius or the same philosophical
acuteness In pointing out his character
istic excellencies." And of these excel
lencies the greatest In Coleridge's mind
was Shakespeare's Judgment. "The con
summate Judgment of Shakespeare." he
says in his "Table Talk," "not only in the
general construction, but in all the detail
of his dramas. Impressed me with even
greater wonder than the might of his
genius or the depth of his philosophy."
And again, "Shakespeare waa a great poet
acting upon laws arising out of his own
nature, and not without law." Here Is a
change, indeed, from the earlier concep
tion of Shakespeare as a wild, irregular
and lawless genius. And It is just this
profound conviction of the organic order
and unity of Shakespeare's work, and the
Princeton I niversity
known facts and its complete avoidance
of conjecture. It gives us what is known
of the poet's outer life, but makes no at
tempt to realize his personality. The
pendulum has swung to the other ex
treme.
Conclusion.
At the close of the nineteenth century
Shakespeare's fame stands higher than It
ever did before; its Influence reaches fur
ther. One hundred and llfty years ago
he was hardly known outside of hla
island. Toward the close of the last cen
tury he conquered our Teutonic kinsmen.
The nineteenth has seen his triumphant
entrance into Latin and Slav lands. Hla
plays hold the boards in Paris, Rome,
Budapest and St. Petersburg as In tha
capitals of the English-speaking race.
Complete translations of his works exist
in German. French. Italian. Dutch, Rus
sian, Magyar. Czechish, Swedish, Danish
and Finnish. In Spain and Armenia trans
lations are now under way. and separate
plays have appeared in such widely scat
tered tongues as Welsh. Croatian. He
brew. Japanese and various dialects of
Hindostan. His Influence upon the life
and thought of the civilized world it 13
simply Impossible to estimate. Nor is this
Influence likely to grow less. Even if our
civilization should perish like that of
Greece and Rome the works of Shakes
peare would remain, an everlasting me
morial of the greatest mind of tha strong
est race of modern times.
own feelings in his own person. ThÂ»
story of the poet's life lies buried there,
but at present it seems as If the cloud of
mystery that hangs around it were not
soon to be dispelled.
Probably the sanest and rcost satisfac
tory attempt to discover something of tha
personality of Shakespeare in his plays
has been made by Professor Dowilen. His
division of the poet's work into four peri
ods, which he respectively christened "In
the Workshop," 'In the World," "Out of
the Depths" and "On the Heights," ia
well known. These periods, he holds, are
distinguished not merely by differences in
the poet's power of expression but also
by tbe subjects with which they deal, and
by the widely varying tone and temper
which inform them. The whole purpose
of Professor Dowden's "Mind and Art of
Shakebpeare" is to trace the evolution of
the poet's genius and the changes of the
poet's mind from the earliest stage of gay
apprenticeship to the final closing of the
drama, when the master broke his staff
and buried his book and went back to die
in quiet Stratford. The result of the
critic's study is summed up In the words:
"The Shakespeare Invariably bright, gen
tle and genial is the Shakespeare of a
myth. The man actually discoverable be
hind the plays was a man tempted to pas
sionate extremes, but of strenuous will,
and whose highest self pronounced in
favor of sanity."
More pretentious but hardly so reliable
is the elaborate work. "William Shake
speare." by Dr. Brandes. the greatest liv
ing critic of Northern Europe. This is a
splendid effort to reconstruct the man
from his work, and to interpret that work
by the known facts of Shakespeare's Ufa
and the influence of his environment. ThÂ»
purpose of the book, he declares, is "to
prove that Shakespeare is not thirty-six
plays and a few poems jumbled together,
but a man who has felt and thought, re
joiced and suffered, brooded, dreamed and
created." Unfortunately Dr. Brandes.
with all his wealth of learning and un
doubted keenness of critical perception,
has given far too free a rein to his fancy.
He often mistakes theory for fact and
builds elaborate structures upon shifting
foundations. The book as a whole la
rather an exercise of Imaginative criti
cism than a genuine biography. Yet it
is always Interesting, always stimulating.
and a distinct addition to thÂ» great li
brary of Shakespeare literature.
The principles of this school have been
pushed to an unconscious reductlo ad ab
surdum by Mr. Harris, the late editor of
the Saturday Review. In a series of es
says on the true Shakespeare which ap
peared In that periodical during the year
IS3B he asserts that the work of Shakes
peare Is of so subjective a character that
ft is easier to realize his personality than
that of any other writer. By the simple
process of Identifying Shakespeare with
various characters of his ptays. a process
by no means devoid of Ingenuity and sug
gestiveness, hÂ© arrives at the conclusion
that the poet was a "combination of
physical delicacy and extreme sensitive
ness." too weak to endure the rough
man's life of Elizabethan London, a vic
tim of Insomnia and the slave of sensual
passion â In short, a modern neuropath. It
were better to leave Shakespeare wrappM
In the cloud than to present tho world
with such a figure.
And In fact a reaction against this
school is already, visible. The latest lifÂ»
of Shakespeare (Sidney Lee's) Is remark
able for Its dogged insistence upon the

Many Ships Released
After Inspection.
THREE VESSELS PRATIQUED
?
FIVE SUGAR BOATS ALLOWED
TO LAND CARGO.
The United States quarantine officer was
kept busy yesterday. Before noon he
released three transports, early in the aft
ernoon he allowed two schooners to go
about their business and before sundown
he gave the brig W. G. Irwin and barka
Mohican and Diamond Head pratique.
This leaves the transport Ben Mohr alone
in the quarantine grounds, and shs will
probably be released to-day.
The transport Manauense was the first
of the fleet to get away from Angel Isl
and. She steamed slowly down the bay
and came to anchor off Folsom street
wharf. Representatives of the transport
eervice went out to the vessel on Sunday
and the testimony of the entire crew was
taken in the matter of the alleged unsea
worthiness of the vessel. As far as can
be gathered the evidence is all against
the army officers who sent the sensa
tional reports, of the vessel's condition
over the wires.-' Captain Barneson." master
of the transport, says that no repairs save
to her donkey boiler have been made to
the Manauense since she left San Fran
cisco, and that if she is unseaworthy now
she is the most remarkable steamer he
ever set foot on. Since leaving Manila
the transport has ridden out two storms
and the tall end of a typhoon. When,
asked the cause of all the trouble the
genial old master mariner whispered "Bad
whisky." The Government authorities
will not allow a soul aboard until all the
evidence has been taken, and when that
job is accomplished the Manauense will
dock.
The Meade followed the Manauense out
of quarantine about 11 a m. She came to
anchor oft* Alcatraz and 139 military pris
oners were landed on the island. Some
of the men were most desperate, and In
consequence Lieutenant Wilson and flfty
flve men were on duty as a guard. The
prisoners were put in the new Jail erected
on the parade ground at Alcatraz. and
there they will be kept, some for six
months and others for varying terms up
to twenty-flve years. The guard was not
taken off until afternoon. The McDowell
then went alongside and took the men to
the Presidio.
Captain Wilson of the Meade Is well
known in San Francisco. He was for
merly a port warden and left here" sev
eral years ago as master of the ship
Alexander Gibson. The latter vessel left
here several weeks ago for New York in
command of Captain Holmes, under whom
Captain Wilson at one time served as
chief offlcer.
" Before coming over and anchoring off
Folsom street wharf, the Ohio put the
remains of 138 soldiers aboard the steamer
Caroline and the latter landed the cof
fins at the Presidio. As soon as the Ohio
has been docked and examined by the
transport officials she will be turned over
to her owners. I
The schooners Ruby A. Cousins and Vine,
both from Honolulu, were released early
in the day. Both vessels were thoroughly
fumigated, and when Dr. Kinyoun was
satisiied that all the rats aboard were
dead he allowed them to dock. There Is
no fear of contagion except from the ver
mln on these vessels, and the quarantine
offlcer 1b determined to see that no bu
bonic plague shall enter San Francisco if
he can help it.
During the afternoon the bark Alden
Bessie arrived from Honolulu and sho
was sent into quarantine to keep the Ben
Mohr company. It will probably be next
Wednesday before the bark is released.
The transport Senator has been re
turned to her owners. She will be Â¦ thor
oughly overhauled and will go Into the
Cape Nome trade in the spring. â¢
Another lot of coasters made port yes
terday. Among them was the ship Glory
of the Seas, bark Harvester and schoon
ers Wing and Wing, Gotama, Una, Chal
lenger and Confronlza.
The Santa Fe's freight steamer Lady
Joicey arrived from the Orient via Hono
lulu and San Diego yesterday. She brings
a very large cargo of general mcrchan
disc for this port and, after discharg
ing, she will go to Portland to load flour
and then to San Diego to complete load
ing.
Captain Gielow goes out on the Corona,
vice Debney, who remains ashore on ac
count of ill health. Captain Stark goes
out on the Laguna, vice Captain Hansen.
The Laguna has been sold by Pollard &
Dodge to parties who will outfit her foÂ»
Cape Nome. The purchase price was $25,
000.
The schooner Robert R. Hind has ar
rived at Port Townsend, having made the
run from Hawaii in the fast time of 15
days.
The bark Abby Palmer, which left Pu
get Sound for Australia with a load of
lumber a month ago, put into San Pedro
yesterday. She was caught in a south
easter off the coast of Mendocino and lost
her deckload. Reports from San Pedro
received by the Merchants' Exchange
yesterday state that she landed one of
the crew, who had both legs broken.

exposition, at once learaea ana Â«""Â»'â¢
astic, of the grounds of his belief that
raises Coleridge above all preceding
Shakesperean critics.
Of Coleridge's contemporaries and dis
ciples, Hazlitt and Lamb, we need not
speak at length. Hazlitt's work is mark
ed by unbounded enthusiasm and keen
critical insight, but marred on the other
hand by the intrusion of personalities ana
political reflections, and quite wanting in
moral depth. He devoted himself espe
cially to the exposition of the characters
of Shakespeare's plays, and his work is
one of the most valuable contributions In
English to pure esthetic criticism.
Charles Lamb, more than any of his
contemporaries, devoted himself to the re
vivification of the age in which Shake
speare lived. His "Specimens of English
Dramatic Poets Contemporary with
Shakespeare" may be said to have re
stored Marlowe. Heywood. Webster and
a host of forgotten worthies to English
literature. But his peculiar love for these
victims of unjust oblivion did not blind
him to the surpassing merits of their mas
ter. His design in the "Specimens" was.
he declares, at once "to show how much
of Shakespeare shines in his contempo
raries and how far in his divine mind
and manners he surpassed them and all
mankind." His "Tales from Shake
speare" thraw open to childhood the
doors of an enchanted world, and his
letters and essays are starred with subtle
and sympathetic criticism of Shake
speare's plays and their interpreters upon
the stage. And if at times the note of
whimsicality and paradox that marks all
the work of Elia appears, it only adds
charm and suggestiveness to the real
value of his flashes of criticism.
Shakespeare and the Personal School
of Criticism.
The latest development in Shakespear
ean criticism has been that of a school
which has sought to reconstruct the per
sonality of the poet from his work. Even
In the last century Capell lamented the
lack of a critical life of Shakespeare
which would trace the development of
his genius. Such a work, however, was
Impossible so long as the chronological
succession of his plays was unknown.
But the labor of a score of editors has
practically established this, and the evi
dence as to the poet's development which
may be drawn from the order of his plays
has been supplemented by the autobio
graphical element In the Sonnets. The
story contained in these was curiously
disregarded by the older critics and even
by the romantic school. But since the
early years of this century a vast amount
of ink has been shed thereover, with, we
must confess, amazingly little result. It
was long ago recognized that the greater
part of the Sonnets was addressed to a
youthful friend of Shakespeare, a smaller
number to a woman, commonly known
as the Dark Lady. Drake in ISI7 pro
posed to Identify the friend as Southamp
ton: Bright in 1819 was the first to sug
gest the name of "William Herbert. The
apparent allusion in the Sonnets to an
intrigue between the poet's friend and
his sweetheart has lately been taken up
and developed with great detail by Mr.
Tvler who professes to have discovered
the identity of-the Dark Lady with Mary
Fitton, a maid of honor to Elizabeth.
Upon this basis he has constructed a
plausible and undoubtedly attractive the
ory of the tragedy of Shakespeare a life,
a story of love, betrayal, suffering and
forgiveness. But Mr. Tyler's theory has
been so rudely challeneged by Sidney Lee
and Lady Newdigate that even the faith
of those who were readiest to give It cre
dence has been shaken.
. Mr. Lee. in fact, asserts there la no
story at all in the Sonnets: but this is to
go, one feels, a step too far. The per
sonal note rings plain enough In them for
him who has ears to hear, and we may
still hold with Wordsworth, Hugo, Kreys
sig. Swinburne, Furnivall and Dowden
that Shakespeare's Sonnets express his

LOCAL SHIPPERS AROUSED
DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOR OF
LOS ANGELES.
Three of the largest and most Influen
tial commercial and industrial organiza
tions of Northern California have entered
an earnest protest against the proposed
tariffs between Los Angeles and San Joa
quln Valley points. The protest was in
the form of the following dispatch:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 5, 1900.
William Sproule, Freight and Trafflo
Manager Southern Pacific Company, W. A. .
Blssell, Assistant Trafflo Manager Santa FÂ«
System, Los Angeles, Cal.: The under
signed commercial organizations of San
Francisco earnestly protest against your
proposed tariffs between Los Angeles and
San Joaquln Valley points, inasmuch as
same are inequitable and do not give due
consideration to relative topography and
density of population as compared with tar
iffs in force between San Francisco and said
points. We ask that you at least postpone
making same operative until we have been
given a hearing. Answer to Eugene Good
win. Mills build.ng. AAWATKixgi
President Board of Trade.
A. SBARBORO,
President Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association of California.
CHARLES NELSON,
President Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Goodman, manager of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association, In
discussing the matter at Issue said:
The cause of the sending of this telegram
by the commercial bodies of San Francisco
was as follows: Following the action of the
Southern Pacific Company and the Kant a
Fe denying the right of fruit shippers of
Southern California to route their goods, the
Chamber of Commerce and other commer
cial bodies of Los Angeles took up the fight
with the railroad companies on behalf of the
fruit shippers to compel them to rescind the
order. It Is now believed that the railroad
people, finding the pressure hard to bear,
represented to the commercial bodies at Los
Angeles that the fruit shippers' light was
not theirs, probably saying to them if
you will drop this light against us we will
make concessions to the merchants of Loa
Angeles by lowering freight rates so as to
permit Los 'Angeles merchants to ship into
the territory adjacent to Bakersfleld and as
far north as Tulare.
We say that we believe this Is the case,
Â¦for the new freight tariff effective February
10 from Los Angeles to the territory named
Is reduced so that Los Angelos shippers have
an advantage of from 10 to 18 cents per hun
dred pounds over San Francisco shippers.'
In fixing freight rates to points' ln the inte
rior, not subject to water competition,
transportation companies have been and are
largely influenced by the topography of the
country and the density of population trib
utary to the points to which freight rates are
to be made. Heretofore the railroad traffic
officials have recognized these factors In de
termining the freight rates out ol San
Francisco and Los Angeles, so that Te
hachapi has been the dividing line to which
Los Angeles and San Francisco were on an
equal basis In transportation matters.
Under the new tariff, if It should become
effective, the territory from Tehachapl to
Tulare would be taken from the San Fran
cisco merchants and the business turned
over to Los Angeles by reason or this change
in the freight rates.,
If these two factors, topography and densi
ty of population, be considered, there can
be no question as to the fairness of the old
transportation rates as between Los Angeles
and San Francisco. From San Francisco to -
Bakersfleld the country is level and with a
number of Important towns along the line:
from Los Angeles to Bakersfleld. two moun
tain ranges must be passed over and with no
towns of importance to be supplied.
COAL IMPORTERS
MOST PAY DUTY
ON ANTHRACITE
Judge Hawley Deliv
ers the Opinion.
CONGRESS MEANT TO TAX IT
BLACK DIAMONDS NOT OF THE
FIRST WATER DUTIABLE.
Judge Hawley in the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals yesterday handed
down a decision in the celebrated anthra
cite coal case of Charles P. Coles against
the Collector of Customs at the port of
San Francisco. The decision will settle
several hundred cases of like character
hung up in the Federal courts awaiting
the action of the Circuit Court of Ap
peals in this matter.
Coal Importers are vitally Interested
because the Judgment of the court will
oblige them to pay many tens of thou
eands of dollars as duties upon anthra
cite coal of a certain quality, which du
ties will go to enrich the treasury of the
United States.
The opinion of Judge Hawley sustains
the decision of the Board of United States
Appraisers at New York and of the
United States Circuit Court in this city.
So that the case of Charles P, Coles
against the Collector is Bettled for all
time, as well as several hundred similar
cases dependent upon its fate.
The appeal was taken from the Judg
ment of the Circuit Court sustaining the
decision of the Board of General Apprais
ers that a cargo of anthracite coal im
ported from Wales into the port of San
Francisco, which contained less than 92
per centum of fixed carbon, was subject
to duty at the rate of 67 cents per ton, as
provided by paragraph 415 of the act of
July 24, 1897. The appellant contended
that anthracite coal is admitted free un
der paragraph 523, which names as free
of duty "coal, anthracite not specially
provided for In this act." Paragraph 415
reads: "Coal, bituminous and all coal
containing less than 92 per centum of fixed
carbon, and shale, 67 cents per ton of &S
bushels, SO pounds to the bushel."
Judge Hawley's opinion states that
there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in
the language used. "It 13 a cardinal rule
of construction," says the court, "that if
the language used is so clear as to admit
of but one meaning there is no room for
any other construction. It is never allow
able to interpret a paragraph or section
which has no need of interpretation. It
is always easy to pick flaws and catch at
straws and make suggestions that if the
statute meant what is claimed for it by
the opposing side It is reasonable to be
lieve that different language would have
been used.
"We are unwilling to give appellant's
construction of the act, because it would
necessarily imply that Congress did not
understand the plain meaning of the
words 'all coal,' contained in the para
graph in question."
The court next took up the intention of
the lawmakers. Anthracite coal, the de
cision went on to say, had been on the
free list prior to the passage of the Ding
ley act. A quotation was made from the
debate on the question in the Congres
sional Globe of June 30, 1897. "from which
It clearly appears." says Judge Hawley,
"that the Imposition of the duty of 67
cents per ton on all coals containing less
than Â»2 per centum of fixed carbon was
expressly intended by the lawmakers to
cover anthracite as well as bituminous
coals."
The Judgment of the United States Cir
cuit Court is affirmed with costs. The
brief in the case on behalf of the Collec
tor was written by Assistant United
States Attorney Woodworth. and was a
clear and concise exposition of the law.

that on January J. 1901. we may be able to
look back with unalloyed satisfaction on the
year 1900.
A discussion as , to the advisability of
entering Into an agreement with the Los
Angeles Board of Trade by which recov
eries could be made in the southern part
of the State through the Los Angeles
board followed the reading of the report.
In the past the commissions charged by
the southern board were said to be exces
sive. Los Angeles has proposed to do the
southern business of the San Francisco
board if the local board will attend to the
recoveries due southern merchants. The
matter was finally referred to the board
of directors, with power to act.
S. Xickelsburg, S. Feuchtwanger and
Isaac Upham were elected to serve on the
directorate for three years.
After adjournment the board of direc
tors organized for the ensuing year by
the election of the following officers: A.
A. Watkins, president: T. G. Parsons,
first vice president; S. Feuchtwanger, sec
ond vice president; Sanford Bennett,
treasurer; 11. LÂ» Smith, secretary; Joseph
Kirk, attorney. This is President Wat
kins' seventh term.

Another phase of the trouble developed
when Jacob Rosen, one of the cloakmak

secured a warrant In Judge Mogan's court
for the arrest of Jacob Aupenbllck on the
charge of threats to kill. He alleges that
on January 24 Augenblick threatened to

BOARD OF TRADE
REPORTS A YEAR
OF BIG PROFITS
Directors Elected at
Annual Meeting.
?
PROSPERITY IS PERMANENT
â¢
PRESIDENT WATKINS STARTS
HIS SEVENTH TERM.
Not In the history of commerce in this
city has such a favorable report been re
corded as that made yesterday by Presi
dent A. A. Watkins at the annual meet
ing of the Board of Trade of San Fran
cisco.
During the past year there- waa a do
crease of 36 per cent In the business fail
ures in California and Â«,121,00S in the lia
bilities from the previous year. The value
of the methods pursued by the board is
attested by the following facts contained
in the report:
During the twenty-three years of Its exist
ence the number of failures recorded were
10.192; amount of liabilities, (68.564.5Ct; average
liabilities per firm, J6SSO; amount of recoveries,
;:;,HC. 4:i; average percentage of recoveries,
Â£3 9-10.
it Is a matter of record that the dividend
receive! through the medium of the courts In
insolvency cases averages less than 25 per cent.
After reviewing the business transacted
by the beard of directors during the past
year the report concluded as follows:
The commencement of a new year Is a suit
able and proper timo for us to review the
year that has passed away, mark Its successes,
profit by Its failures and formulate our plans
for the year that Is before us.
With regard to the past year It will go down
In history as the beet for trade ever known,
both In volume of business and in profits. It
was a busy year all aroundâ a year of broad
expansion in commerce, a year of high prices,
well paid labor, good profits, and a "record
breaker" In nearly every branch of trade.
While we can look back and rejolc* we can
also look forward with confidence. There Is
every Indication on the business horizon that
we have entered upon an era of prosperity'
which will b<Â» without precedent in our history.
The Increase of the exports of America on
manufactured articles is one of the great signs
of the times. This is due largely, no doubt,
to improved machinery and in this respect we
stand easily first. The inventiveness and
adaptability of American machinists has given
to us the markets of the world.
The prevailing; sentiment among business men
Is one of confidence In what Is to be developed.
It Is a very conservative view of the situa
tion as It la to-day, to quote a commercial
agency, that "the business community looks
forward to ISOO with at least equally mixed
feellnjrs of hope and confidence." These are
the two prime factors in all commercial re
cult?, and as they are so closely allied In the
minds of business men it Is a safe conclusion
that with the conservatism which marks suc
cessful enterprise there need be but little fear

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. I.â The stock market to
day wii Bubjecf-d to a notable process of
digestion and came through the ordeal re
markably well. Stocks which were leaders in
activity and btrength during the movement of
last week were heavily sold to take profits.
The profit-taking was met by a strong demand
and offerings were absorbed with little difficulty
and without any material concession in price
being made necessary. Indeed any approach
In prices to Saturday's level resulted in a
notable hardening market, the surface becom
ing practically unyielding at Saturday's level.
Offerings cf etock fell to a minimum and
buyers in order to secure stocks were obliged
to raise bids to a point to yield profits to the
eellers on their last week's purchases. While
professional operators were thus taking profits
at come points in the list they were replacing
their funds in other stocks which had not
moved last week or In which the movement
had beer, only Inaugurated. Thus, with trad-
Ing proceeding on an active scale and the
movement of prices taking on a considerable
degree of irregularity, the market presented
all the characteristics of a true bull move
ment. Upward movements In prices were eas
ily achieved and the speculative Bentiment
ehowed itself quick to respond to any news
developmerts regarding special stocks. Thus
a number of railroad stocks responded quickly
and emi'haticaliy to returns of earnings for
the fourth week in January, showing targe
Increases over the high level of last vesr.
The leaders of the railroad list were the "Nor
folk acd Western Etock?, the fourth week state
ir.er.t showing an increase of $122,354 over last
year. As this Is or.c of the roads which by
reason of previous heavy outlays Is able to
deduce the current rate of operating expenses,
the showing waÂ» doubly effective. The com
mon stock advanced 3-% and the preferred IVi.
Louisville. Ht. Louis and San Francisco, Den
ver and Rio Grande and a number of other
railroads responded to good Ftatements of earn
ings. St. Paul and Burlington ehowed re
nev.-ed strength on reports of an Improvement
tn the movement at gTain on the Western lines
In addition to the extraordinary movement of
general merchandise. The iron and steel stocks
continued very prominent and .the leadership
here was shifted also under the influence of
realizing in American Steel and Wire and
come others. The new leader of the group was
National Bteel. which was very heavily bought
en floating reports of enormous earnings for
the past year to be shown by the forthcoming
report. Reports of a similar kind have been
unheeded lor most part on Wall street, but
to-day the etock market shot up under the in
fluence an extreme 2%. Other members of
the metal group cl&Â«ely allied by Identity of
ownership moved in close sympathy. Amer
ican Houp and Tin Plate are in this class.
Republic Steel, the smelting stocks and Ana
conda were also etrong. Speculators are in
clined to discount to some extent the increase
in the circulation provided for in the finan
cial bill In Congress and in consequence ignore
come of the indications of encroachment on
the money supply on other accounts. The
market closed active and strong at best prices
for mar:y clocks.
The bond market was irregular and not so
active us cf late. Total sales, par value, $2.

Fate of Two Wealthy
Brothers.
Â¦ " ?
PORTLAND, Ind., Feb. s.â William and
John Newton, bachelor brothers, were
burned to death on the home of the
former, one mile west of here, this morn
ing. One body, supposed to be that of
John was found in the cellar. Only a
few bones of the other were found. In
the rear of the ruins were some chairs
and a bundle of papers, which had evi
dently been carried out. No actual evi
dence of foul play has been discovered.
William Newton was 75 years of age

EVIDENCE FOR RODLEY.
Witnesses for the Prosecution Are
Flatly Contradicted.-
OROVILLE, Feb. s.â The Rodley case Is
rapidly drawing to a close. Many wit
nesses were placed on the stand to-day.
Eight of these testified to the character
of the defendant, Dr. Rodley, for truth,
honesty and integrity. All said It was
good. A strong point was made for the
prosecution when It waa shown that the
woman, Mrs. C. Hogan, whom Dr. Rod
ley swore he went to see when he visited
Biggs on February 15, 1898, had been
away from that town for a long time
prior to that date. Her sister and a
friend testified to these facts. She comes
here to-night from Southern California to
swear to the same fact.
A Mrs. L. M. Dunn of Chlco testified
that she was in Dr. Rodley's ofllce when
Colonel Batchelder and his wife were
there, on February IS. ISS3. The colonel
and his wife both testified positively after
her testimony that Mrs. Batchelder did
not go to Chlco on that date, and no
one said the colonel was in the office at
the time of his visit. Mrs. Dunn testi
fied that she had never told a living soul
what her testimony would be; had never
talked It over with her husband. Dr. Rod
ley, his wife.hls attorneys or any one
else. Sheriff Wilson swore that Dr. Rod
ley told him he went to Biggs with a
copy of the Fuller will In his pocket; that
he saw Colonel Batchelder and the latter
advised him to have nothing to do with
it, and then on his way home he tore
it up. -

company made the stipulation when it
sold the land that no liquor should be
vended thereon. J. H. Mclnness opened
a saloon on a lot purchased from the com
pany, which immediately filed a com
plaint asking that the land be decreed
back to them, as Mclnness had broken the

of liquor. The coming summer will see

SHOT HIMSELF TO DEATH.
Suicide Used Same Kind of Weapon
as Amy Murphy and It Pro
duced a Similar Wound. v
N. Schmidt, a laborer, residing at 634
Pacific street, cpmmltted suicide by
shooting himself in the head in the door
way of J. R. Lafontalne's printing estab
lishment, at 603 Merchant street, last
night. Despondency Is supposed to have
been the cause of his act.
The pistol used by Schmidt was the ex
act' counterpart of the one which Is sup
posed to have been purchased and used
by Amy Murphy. It was a 38-caliber
American double action of a cheap make.
Dr. Lealand examined the suicide's
wound and pronounced it similar to the
one inflicted in Miss Murphy's head.
Three deep gaahes opened near where the
bullet entered. The similarity of pistols
and wounds will be called to the attention
of the jury in the Murphy case.

DESERTING SPOUSES
WHO FAIL TO APPEAR
OAKLAND, Feb. s.â Defaults were en
tered to-day In the divorce suits of Marie
Rosebro against Walter E. Rosebro and
Amy Wilson against Anton W T ilson, both
brought on the ground of desertion. The
Rosebros were married In 1595. The hus
band "is described,as an able-bodied con
ductor in San Francisco, earning $75
monthly wages; and In June, IS9B. he de
serted his wife. He has never* appeared
or filed answer In the suit. The Wilsons
were married January 4, 18S9, and in 1897
the husband deserted his wife and four
children. Both cases were referred to
Court Commissioner Babcock to take tes

EXPANSION OPPOSED
IN SENATE AND HOUSE
WASHINGTON, Feb. s.â Senator Caf
fery of Louisiana, In a discussion of the
Philippine question In the Senate to-day,
broke new ground in developing his posi
tion as an anti-expanslonlst. In response
to a question as to what, in the present
circumstances, he would do with the Fili
pinos, he said with characteristic cour
age of conviction:
"Turn them loose as soon as we can
get rid of them. That would be better
for them and infinitely better for us."
Caffery's argument was mainly a dis
cussion of the constitutional question. He
maintained that the constitution extended
absolutely over the Filipinos, and that
they were entitled to all the rights and
privileges of citizens of the United States
guaranteed by the constitution.
The Democrats of the House continued
their assaults upon. the Philippine policy
of the administration diirlng the general
debate upon the diplomatic and consular
appropriation bill to-day. Two speeches
were made by Democratic members of
the Foreign Affairs Committeeâ Dinsmore
of Arkansas and Champ Clark of Mis
souriâopposing the retention of the isl
ands. The speech of Clark, which lasted
almost two hours, was a notable effort,
replete with unique epigrams, and at
tracted much attention. No Republican
spoke In defense of the administration to
day. â¢ Â¦
Slbley of Pennsylvania, who was elected
as a Democrat but who made a speech
last week defending expansion, was goad
ed to-day into the announcement that the
Democrats could consider his seat con
structively on the Republican side.

DEATH OF R. S. DUNCAN,
SCOTTISH-AMERICAN
AL-AMEDA, Feb. 6.â Robert S. Duncan,
who was prominently identified with all
the Scottish-American societies of Cali
fornia, died this morning at the residence
of his father-in-law, J. C. Bates, 2165 Cen
tral avenue. Death was due to appendi
citis.
Mr. Duncan was born In Scotland
thirty-five years ago. He came to Cali
fornia when quite young. He was inter
ested in the firm of J. M. Duncan & Son
of San Francisco, was a member of the
Caledonian Club and a leader In its af
fairs. He also belonged to Clan Fraser,
Order of Scottish Clans, and was district
deputy of the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, with which he had long been
connected. He was married a little over
a year ago to Miss Caroline Bates, daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Bates.
The funeral will take place Wednesday
from Alcazar Hall. San Francisco, at 2
o'clock, and will be conducted by the
United Workmen. A short service will
be held at the residence at 11 o'clock.
INCENDIARY AT
WORK IN NAPA
Second Attempt Made to
Burn a School.
Special Dispatch to The Call
NAPA, F^eb. s.â Another attempt was
made Sunday night by a fire fiend to burn
down the Central public school building
here, but the plans miscarried. This is
the second time that the torch has been
applied to this handsome structure, the
first being In the early part of last De
cember. The public schools opened to
day after a six weeks' vacation, and
Janitor Hoover went to the building at
about 7 o'clock to get things in readiness
for the day's work. As the Janitor was
entering the building on the north tide
he noticed a piece of paper sticking out
of a ventilator leading to the basement on
the north side.
Hoover investigated and soon found that
the paper and wood had been saturated
with coaloll over a space of five feet. On
the ground were also found many bunches
of burned matches. Hoover investigated
further and found more evidence of the
attempted crime on the south side of tbe
building. Here a ventilator had been
broken and more coaloil had been throv/n
on the building. Beneath this an empty
bottle that had contained coaloil was
found. The matter has caused ffrcÂ«it
alarm, and if the guilty party Is caught
he will be severely dealt with.
There always has been a suspicion that
the first attempt was the work of a fire
bug, and the local detectives have been
at work on the case quietly, for the last
two months, but have been unable to pet
any clew of the criminal. It is thought
that local parties are the guilty ones, and
a sharp lookout is being kept now for the
fiend. A high north wind was blcwir^g
last night and if the fire had started noth
ing could have saved the building.

. Â£ â¢
The Bostonians had their, annual picnic
at the Columbia last night. All smartdom
wan there and the audience was friendly
to its favorites In the same old way. Sea
son after season they have sung at us In
old operas and new with new singers and
old, and the latter at least are always sure
of our approbation. Barnabee, Mac Donald
and Frothingham all came in for a good
natured greeting and warbled and acted
in the same familiar way. It is not a very
good way surely, but it seems to please
as much as It ever did, and the faith of
the public Is undiminlshed.
I should per-aps exempt Frpthlngham,
for in his way he is clever and amusing,
but Mac Donald. who never could sing, is
now absurd when he makes the attempt,
and Barnabee, ripe In years, but still
fresh in favor, peems to depend entirely
upon his reputation which he earned a
very long time ago and has since spent.
The Bostonians have never had but one
real singer in the male department, Tom
Karl, and aside from him they have ever
been notorious for their bad tenors, of
whom the present treble trespasser Is
probably the "weakest. His name is Frank
Rushworth.
Helen Bertram has a good carrying
voice that from its hard quality ought to
Â¦withstand a great deal of hard usage. She
has grace and spirit, however, and acts
with a whiff that is delightful. Mlsa
Marcia Van Dresser was beautiful and
hoarse, and the management craved the
indulgence of the audience for her mis
chance. She seems to have a fair con
tralto voice, which she produces badly
from the roof of her mouth, but she Is
exceedingly good to look upon and wears
some stunning costumes well.
The opera last night was important lo
cally and generally. "The Smugglers of
Badayez," by Glacomo Minkowsky, some
time a San Franciscan, has a great deal
of musical merit in It. There are some
flaws in the composition, but they He for
the most part in the plot and libretto. The
music is admirable. The overture was de
cidedly encouraging and the orchestration
throughout is of a surprisingly high order
of art. Its tone is decidedly superior to
the book of which it is the setting, and
belongs properly to a more elevated plane
than that of a comic opera. Mr. Mln
kowsky's intention. I understand, was to
compose a romantic opera and his music
has been made to fit a rather trashy sub
stitute for the original. This has Involved
an alteration of the tempi in many places
and a general distortion of the serious
musical purpose of the work.
There is a flavor of the young Italian
school about "The Smugglers," and the
treatment of the vocal and instrumental
elements is decidedly modern In certain
passages. This is notably so In the two
duets between tenor and soprano, which
are strongly suggestive of Puccini's "La
Boheme." In sharp contrast to this well
made music there are a number of cheap
songs that hark back to the worst comio
opera traditions. A stupid trio and a
senseless quartet that smack of burlesque
and an occasional gag song thrown in for
good measure and bad taste. Some of the
music lingers with one by reason of Its
swing and melody. A march In the first
act and a waltz song In the second have
all the elements of popularity, and tho
finale of this act Is, although rather com
monplace, decidedly meritorious.
Mr. Mlnkowsky's opera Is musically In
genious and familiarity with It would dis
cover much to admire. The performance
by the Bostonlans is a secondary consid
eration. It Is not good, but it does not
seriously offend.
PORTER GARNETT.
Alcazar.
Mary Hampton made her first appear
ance as leading lady last night at the Al
cazar Theater in Edwin' Milton Royle's
comedy-drama, "Friends," and the en
thusiastic manner in which she was re
ceived by the large audience must have
been exceedingly gratifying to her. At
the close of each act the curtain had to
be raised several times, and friends and
admirers showered her with floral trib
utes. She scored a genuine success in
the part of Marguerite Otto, which gave
full scope to her clear and sympathetic
voice and graceful diction. #
Ernest Hastings and Charles Bryant as
the two "friends" did full justice to their
parts and came In for a proportionate
measure of the applause. Howard Scott
made a hit in. the character part of Hans
Otto, the drunken old man, and received
a special call before the curtain after the
close of the third act. Jeffrey Williams
was good as John Paden Sr., a business
man, and George P. Webster was at home
as the villain. Laura Crews. Marie Howe,
Miss Vaughan and Emily Wakeman com
pleted the excellent cast.
Alhambra.
"The opening night of "London Life" on
Sunday evening at the Alhambra Theater
brought with It a full house, and the repe
tition of the performance last evening was
satisfactory to the management. The
play, a melodrama. Is new and comes to
this city at a time when this class of pro
ductions is most It is full of
touching scenes, interspersed with laugh
able situations.
As the name implies, "London Life" la
laid in the big city and illustrates life in
the upper, middle and lower strata of
society. The attractive feature lies in the
fact that the play Is clean, and while
there Is a moral to It, the moral does not
depend for its strength upon the downfall
of a woman.
The cast is all new to this city, recently
arriving from New York via Portland and
the northern circuit. The members of the
company have their lines well In hand.
Next week the Alhambra will produce the
original pictures of the Jeffreys-Sharkey
championship fight.
Orpheum.
The usual "standing room only" sign
was hung out at the Orpheum last night,
and the big audience appeared to thor
oughly enjoy every feature of the bill,
Judging from the applause, Michell, the
colored acrobatic comedian, started the
laughter, and there waa no cessation of
the merriment from that time until the
flnal drop of the curtain, except of course
when Paplnta and the acrobatic gym
nasts held the boards. Paplnta, as usual,
was enthusiastically applauded. The
Sohlkes, In their novelty dances, assisted
by their five little so-called "archipela
gbans." made a decided hit, while Irene
Franklin, the singing soubrette: Bruett
and Riviere, tho French duetlsts and
mimics, and Mr. and Mrs. Perkins
Fisher, the comedy artists, came In for
their full share of applause. The bio
graph will show an entire new series of
pictures, beginning to-night. .
Grand Opera-House.
"Aladdin Jr." opened the week with a
big house and the encores kept the show
going until a late hour. The extravaganza
is replete with song and dance specialties,
the Hawaiian quintet and little Maud Sar
enson being the favorites. Bella Hart
made her first appearance and Justified
the predictions of hor friends that she
will make a good soubrette with a little
more study and experience. Edith Mason
never appeared to better advantage than
in the songs, "The Sweetest Story Ever
Told" and "Love's Sorrow." Hattie Belle
Ladd's "Message of the Rose" and "I
Wants Ma Honey Back Again"as well as
Bessie Fairbalrn's "Arrah Go- On." were
deservedly encored. The piece closes with
a gorgeous transformation scene. It ought
to be good for a two weeks' run.
Chutes.
At the Chutes Theater last night Doug
lass and Ford, a' neat and eccentric sons
And dance team, occupied the stage for
and Electric Company for lighting and repair-
Ing lamp posts and lamps for January, and
$8374 20 for lighting electric arc lamps; res

pher for the Investigation of water and

Crying Need of a Matron in the In
terest of Morality Depicted by
Mrs. Olney of Oakland
Club. â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. '
90S Broadway. Feb. 6. â¢
A startling condition of affairs about
the conduct of the County Jail developed
before the Board of Supervisors to-day.
It was shown that female offenders when
brought to the prison are not usually
searched, and it would be an easy matter
for female accomplices of male prisoners
to smuggle opium, whisky and even tools
with which to accomplish a jail delivery
into the Institution without detection.
The need of a matron at the County Jail
had just been called to the attention of
the board by a communication from the
Oakland Club, an organization represent
ing some 200 of Oakland's most prominent
and influential women. The communica
tion waa signed by President Mrs. Alice
Bunnell, Secretary Miss L. Barker and
Katherine E. Felton, Mrs. Mary Tracy
Mott, Mrs. C. M. Olney, Mrs. L. TV. Cur
tis and Susan J. Fenton, M. D. They rec
ommended the appointment of Mrs Dr.
Rice to the position of matron.
Mrs. C. M. Olney said: "There ought to
be a matron at the Jail in the interest of
morality." There are now four girl pris
oners under the age of 20 years, with no
one to urge them to lead better lives.
"Female prisoners," continued Mrs. Ol
ney, "are really at the mercy of the
'trusties.' " She declared she knew that
"trusties" frequently go into the women's
ward.
"If the Sheriff permits this," responded
Supervisor Church, "he is certainly not
doing what is proper."
Sheriff Rogers and Chief Jailer Schoenau
were sent for. In answer to questions
they stated that it was not customary for
"men trusties" to visit the women's ward,
"but," remarked Schoneau. "at times I
have allowed the head 'trusty* to take
coal and wood to the women's cell. At
other times the 'trusty* is usually accom
panied by a Deputy Sheriff." As to
whether it Is customary to search female
prisoners when they first arrive at the
jail. Jailer Schoenau said: "It is not cus
tomary to search the women: only when
I have any suspicion I call in Mrs. Taylor,
the wife of Deputy Jailer Taylor, who re
sides at the jail, and I ask her to search
the woman."
Sheriff Rogers was not adverse to hav
ing a matron appointed, but assumed that
if such an appointment is to be made he
should be consulted, aa he considered it
his province to make the appointment. It
is intimated that if the Sheriff is to make
the appointment his choice will be Mrs.
Taylor, who has resided at the County
Jail building ever since her husband's ap
pointment as deputy Jailer.
The matter was temporarily disposed of
by referring to the District Attorney for
an opinion the question of the board's
right to grant the Oakland Club's petition
for a matron and order the claims for
such service paid. On these points the
Attorney will report at the next meeting.

WITH BOERS ADOPTED.
*
Protest Filed by Gabriel Printing
Company Against Awarding
Contract to a Finn Other
Than Lowest Bidder.
The ordor imposing a tax of ">fl cents per
quarter on each nickel-in-the-slot tele
phone wa? finally passed by a unanimous
vote at yesterday's meeting of th<? Board
of Supervisor*. The. order now needs but
the signature of the Mayor to become a
law, and as he has expressed himself in
favor of licensing the telephones It Is a
forepone conclusion that he will affix his
name to a measure which in the opinion
of all right minded cltixens is a just one.
As the order now stands the city will be
enriched annually in the sum of $36,000.
there being abcut IR.OOO 'phones with
nickel bozea in actual use. Before the
vote was taken en the adoption Supervisor
Reed, chairman of the Public Utilities
Committee, desired that the order be re
committed to the License Committee, In
order that Investigation regarding th* In
come of the con>pany could be made and
a tax commensurate with it imposed.
"It Feems to me," paid Reed, "that 50
cents a quarter is rather low. I under
stand that the former order, which his
Honor vetoed, carried with it a tax of fl
per quarter."
The Mayor explained that the 536..XK1 to
he derived by the order would amount to
3 per cent on an Investment of $I^o,ooo.
Comte desiretl the immediate pass&fe of
the order, on the ground that any delay
would cause the city to lose so much rev
enue. On moticn to recommit Brandcn
stfln end P.eed voted aye. but joined their
colleagues In vctlr.g for the flnal passage
of the order.
The following resolutions were intrc
duced by Reed for the purpose of frus
trating any attempt to divert the appro
priation for 6t. Mary's Park to liquidat
ing the deficit with which the city is con
fronted:
Whereas. On the first flay of January, j
lK<o. the funds of the city and county pro
vided by the tax levy of the fiscal year vrere |
overdrawn to the amount of $135,230 f2; and
Whf-reas. It has been r.<urposed to remedy
such deficiency by applying the $115,000 in
the treasury levied for the ac<ruisition of
l^t. Mary's Tark to the payment of current
â¢ xpenses, notwithstanding the act <Statr
uteÂ« oÂ£ 1559. p. 361) under which the said
$123. < VÂ») xias levied provides that the revenue
so obtained "shall be applied to no other use
or pazpOMTTi and
Whereas. The act of ISS9 is the same act
under which the park b^nd election of De
eexober 2*. ISSS. wes held, and the impalr
tnest ft it? provisions in relation to St.
Utrfi Park will necessarily constitute an
Â»â¢â¢ Â¦ >â¢. ujic.n the park bonds as well; and
Whereas, It is reasonable to suppose, and
members of the board have been informed
that l^al proceedings will be commenced
turainn the city by interested citizens en
1 ining the app^iyriation of the said $125,000
lor any other purpose than for the acquisi
tion of Pt. Mary's Park, thus withdrawing
the raid fund from- the control of the munci
pality pending a decielon by the Supreme.
Court; therefore be it
Uenolved. That It is the sense of the Board
of ?cj*nif=ors that the money now in the
tr^acurj' tat the purpose of acquiring St.
:.:..-:.- Park should not be used for any
other rurfow, and the Finance Committee
. is directed to devise ways and means to cur
tail the expenses of the government and pre
; vent a deficit at the end of the fiscal year
Dtber than by an appropriation of the funds
devoted to the purchase of St. Marv"s Park.
During the discussion of Reed's resolu
tion, which was referred to the Judiciary
Committee, the Mayor took occasion to
deny an article published In a morning
pap^r to the effect that he and the last-i
iinard of Supervisors had pledged them- I
polvrs in writinp to the appropriation for
the purchase of St. Mary's Park. He
stated that he had never so pledged him- 1
pelf and also denied that he had recom- j
mended that the license on liquor saloons '
he Increased to $600 a year, which state- I
merit had also been attributed to him. He !
concluded by a gentle admonition to the
reporters to be more careful In the future.
The following resolutions of sympathy
with the Boers were presented by Super
visor Curtis and adopted; Brandensteln,
Hotaling, Jennings, McCarthy. Reed and
Â£anderfcon voting no:
Whereas. The flag under which we live
proclaims and the constitution, wlfich is the
Inundation of our Government, guarantees
to every citizen of this commonwealth the
fullest and highest measure of political and '
moral liberty; and
Whereas, We, ar citizens of this great re
public, knowing and appreciating the price
less value of liberty, should and do desire
thct all peoples and all nations should be
partaken! with v* of its benefits: and
Whereas, A sturdy race of liberty loving
. peo;.le ts at present engaged in a magnificent
an.! unconquerable struggle for ; freedom
apainst the most colossal and avaricious
empire in the world; therefore be it
liesolved. That we, the Board of Supervi
sors of the City and County of San Fran
cisco, in regular meeting assembled, do
hereby extend our heartiest sympathy and
good wishes to- the Boers of the Transvaal
and Orange Tr^e Ptate in their present glo
rious strurgle for freedom:
Resolved. That w* condemn as subversive
of all true liberty the unjust and cruel war
fare now being waged by the British em
pire against a people vastly inferior to her
in magnitude and resources. And that we
heartily admire and commend the brave
I*oers on the brilliant stand they have thus
far marie against an overwhelming foe, and
we earnestly hope for a speedy termination
cf their gallant struggle and the establish
ment of their status, as the free and lnde- j
I<endent United states of South Africa.
Considerable discussion was precipitated j
when the resolutions awarding certain I
printing fcr the Assessor's office came up j
for a vote. A protest had been filed by !
the Gabriel Printing Company, in which it i
showed that it was the lowest bidder and <
was therefore entitled to the contract. It
further contended that the resolution re
cently adopted by the board requiring that
all city printing shall bear the label of
the "Allied Printing Trades Council" is
not consistent with the charter, Is inoper
ative and is legislation repugnant to the
Federal and State constitutions. The com
pany's attorney was present to advance
its claim*, while F. Drake, representative
of the Typographical Union, spoke in
favor of the resolution which barred the
Gabriel Company from successfully com
peting for the contract.
Supervisor Tobin took sides with the
proi*Â»*tant and held that the board wa-s
bound by that provision of the charter
which says that contracts must be award
ed to the lowest bidder. There is another
provision that eight hours a day only shall
be exacted on all city work, and It de
veloped that the union shops work nine
hours, while the Typothetae work their
men ten hours and longer. Comte saw a
reconciliation In the order and the charter
provision by stating that while the char
ter contemplated granting the contract to
the lowest bidder the order simply con
ferred on the board the power of fixing
the quality of the printing. The contract
was awarded to Phillips & Smythe never
theless. Tobln withdrew his objection,
stating that it would be a matter for ad
judication by the courts In any event.
The board will have to look elsewhere
for an ordinance intended to 'suppress
nickel-in-the-6lot card machines. Resolu
tions were passed at the last meeting re
rjuesting the City Attorney to prepare
such an ordinance, and the latter yester
day replied in the following curt com
munication:
Gentlemen: I am In receipt of ' Resolution
No. 2S, In which you request the City Attor
ney to prepare an ordinance respecting
r.ickrl-in-ihe-slot machines. In reply
thereto I b*g to refer you to the provisions
of the charter touching the duties of the
City Attorney, which do not require euch
service.
The following resolutions and ordi
nances were passed to print:
An order granting an extension of time to
any corporation, copartnership or Individual
maintaining pole* or overhead wires In un
derground district Xo. 1; resolutions pro/
vid lnÂ« fcr numerous awards of contracts for
printing and stationery for use in the va

MORE MONEY FOR TEACHERS.
Latest Agreement Between Them and
Merchant Creditors.
As a result of a consultation of the
merchant creditors of the School Depart
ment, Attorneys Heller and Powers and
a committee of teachers, an agreement
was reached yesterday whereby the lat
ter will receive about 15 per cent more
of their salaries for the month of No
vember. 1898. It was mainly owing to
the efforts of Auditor Wells that the
teachers recently received 61 per cent of
their unpaid salaries out of $59,000 made
available from money collected as col
lateral inheritance taxes. Besides this
amount there Is now $27,000 now In
escrow in the Union Trust Company's
vault to be distributed under a former
agreement. At the time the $1 compro
mise was made between the teachers
and merchants, whereby the $59,000 was
devoted to unpaid salaries, $8000, also
received from Inheritance taxes, was to
have been turned over to the merchants.
The latter, however, have never made a
demand for this money, and it appears
that by the terms of the latest agree
ment between the interested parties the
teachers will receive $15,000, while the
merchants are to get $20,000, thus apply
ing the $27,000 now In escrow and the
$SOOO apportioned to the merchants to the
partial settlement of their claims. This
will give the teachers about 80 per cent
of their salaries for November, IS3B.
The agreement also provides that as
more moneys are received from Inheri
tance taxes they will be applied to liqui
date the 25 per cent of the salaries re
maining unpaid for November. IS9S, after
which, if there la any left over, the mer
chants' claims will be satisfied. In this
way the entire November salaries will
probably be paid and money may. also
be made available to pay at least a por
tion of the salaries ' for December, IS9S,
still remaining unpaid.

THE suicide theory In the case of
Amy Murphy, the girl whose body
was found In the park on Friday,
was, in the opinion of the law offi
cers, who have held to it all along,
almost completely confirmed yesterday,
when Detectives Ed Wren and Jerry
Dinan found where Miss Murphy had last
Wednesday bought a revolver and car
tridges. These two officers have been
searching for two days for this evidence
and their final success clears up much of
the mystery surrounding Â¦ the death.
On Wednesday afternoon Miss Murphy
entered the sporting goods store of George
W. Shreve at 739 Market street and told
the salesman who waited on her, George
Barber, that she wanted a 3S-caliber pistol
and some cartridges. Barber sold her an
American double-acting bulldog of that
caliber for $1 75 and fifteen cartridges for
25 cents. These cartridges were of two
sizes, but all of them would fit the pistol.
"The young woman came into the store
between 4 and 5 o'clock," said Mr. Barber.
"She did not seem in the least excited
and there was no more trace of agitation
about her than if she had asked for a
tennis racket. She wore a black veil, but
it was not heavy enough to hide her
features. She paid for the pistol and
then asked if I would sell her a few car
tridges. I told her I would sell her any
number she wished, and she agreed to
take fifteen for 25 cents. There were two
kinds of these cartridges, because some
time ago burglars got Into the store and
broke open some boxes of cartridges of
different makes. I threw these all Into a
box together and sold them loose.
"The girl took three of- the cartridges
and put them into the pistol herself in my
presence. She tried to put in a fourth,
but the cylinder would not revolve fur
ther because she had not half-cocked the
hammer. She went out with the other
cartridges in the box. Perhaps she got a
fourth one into the pistol later."
Barber said he had not reported the sell
ing of the pistol sooner because he had
not paid much attention to the case. He
did not realize to whom he had sold the
pistol until the officers questioned him
about it.
The detectives took Barber to McAvoy's
undertaking parlors and there he positive
ly identified the remains as those of .the
person to whom he had sold the pistol.
When Detectives Dinan and Wren
brought the news of the purchase of the
pistol and the subsequent identification of
the remains by Barber as those of the
person who had made the purchase Acting
Chief Biggy said it had been established
to his complete satisfaction that the girl
had shot herself. Â»
"The person who stole the pistol from
beside the body took the watch, too," said
the acting Chief. "The timepiece was not
pawned, because Miss Murphy had plenty
of money without pawning it. She had as
much m 53 of her own and Poulin gave
her $20 more. After giving $10 to her
mother she had at least $15 left. I am of
the opinion that a mushroom hunter,
many of whom go into the park each
morning, according to Officer Dow, com
mitted the theft."
Edmund Cook, who lives at the corner
of Hayes and Devisadero streets, has
probably cleared away the mystery of
the pistol's disappearance. The gist of
Mr. Cook's statement was published in
yesterday morning's Call. He is a man
of means and has been well known here
for years. Mr. Cook was seen yesterday
and said:
"Thursday afternoon I took a stroll to
the park, as I frequently do. and some
time between 4 and 5 o'clock sat down
on the piazza at Tom Klink's place, cor
ner of Fell and Stanyan streets. While
sluing there I heard the repnrt of a pis
tol shot. There was only one report. I
said to myself, 'There's a suicide,' and
started to go over that way. Just then
two small boys came running out of the
park, near Klink's, seemingly excited.
Each appeared about 9 years old. When
they saw me they stopped. Following
them came a boy about 14 years old. He
had his right hand under his left coat
breast and seemed to be holding some
thing there. I thought he had stolen
something. He, too, stopped when he
saw me and looked as if he wanted to
turn back.
"The boys hesitated only for a second.
Then the older one dashed on and the
others followed. They ran as fast as
they could up beyond Hayes street and
out of sight. Of course, I think now that
the oldest one had the pistol with which
Miss Murphy was killed."
Detectives Dillon and Cody, who were
given charge of the main end of the case,
have, through believing from the start in
the suicide theory, worked out every clew
there was in order to leave nothing un
done toward determining whether a mur
der had been committed. They found
nothing to connect Poulin with any sus
picion of having murdered the girl. He
led them at once to the room in the Car
rolton where he said Miss Murphy had
turned on the gas on Saturday week. He
says it was 5:30 o'clock before he reached
that house in response to the summons
of his friend Maile, and found the gas
partly on. The detectives discovered that
Dan Doyle, employed by the United Car
riage Company, is the hackman who took
I Miss Murphy from the Carrolton on that
Saturday evening to 833* Bush street, from
which place the despicable Poulin sent her
from him forever. Doyle was summoned
by a call ring In from the Carrolton. He
said Miss Murphy looked pale and weak
when she left the place, but was able to
walk, supported by her false lover.
Proprietor Maurer of the Carrolton does
not remember the incident of Miss Mur
phy taking a room at his place. Plenty
of people came and went each day, ho
said, and he would remember few of
them.
Dr. Brigham and Dr. Mlddleton viewei
the remains yesterday. Dr. Brigham Bald
he believed there was only one wound and
that it had been Inflicted by a pistol
pressed against the head. Colonel Mid
dleton was of ] the same opinion. Botn
physicians will testify at the Inquest on
Thursday.
One of the questions that still puzzles
Is whether Miss Murphy met any person
In the park the evening of her death. Ac
cording to Park Policeman Dow she did
not. He says he saw the girl, whose re-
mains he has since identified, sitting on a
bench on the Hayes street walk Thurs
day evening. She got up two or three
times, he says, wrung her hands anxious
ly and looked toward the entrance, as If
expecting some one. Finally she took up
a small box lying beside her and disap
peared down a trail. . 'Â¦
In contradiction to this is the statement
of Fred Charles Hergen, a contractor,
who after looking at Miss Murphy's re
mains said they were those of a girl he
had seen last Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday evenings In the park near
where the death occurred.
George C. Malle, the man who was with
Miss Murphy at the Carrolton before
Poulin went there, was taken to head
quarters yesterday by the detectives to
make a statement. Though he Is Poulln's
friend, what he told make 3 that individ
ual appear as a still more cruel and de
testable character.
Maile said that Miss Murphy telephoned
him Saturday forenoon at the Eisen Com
pany's office asking him to meet her at
12:30 near The Call building. He did so.
She was much agitated and looked as If
she had been â¢weeping. She said she
wanted him to deliver a letter and some
money to Horace Poulin and asked him
to accompany her to the Carrolton. She
went up first and secured a room â No. 54 â
there. She complained of Illness and Malle
got her some brandy, after drinking which
she revived and . told him that Horace
Poulin had promised>he would marry her
on her eighteenth birthday, which was
drawing near, but that.he had heard she
had been confined in a^Magdalen asylum
and had declared to her; that he would
have nothing more to do with her. She
told him of 'her living with Poulin and
said she did not want to go home, as her
mother hated her and set her stepfather
against her. Finally, Maile says, she gave
him a letter and $20 05 to give to Poulin,
whom she asked him to befriend.
Maile declared that the girl had been
drinking, and that after crying some more
and declaring she would kill herself fell
asleep on the sofa. Maile then went and
told Poulin, who left the office about 4:20
or 5 o'clock, and telephoned three-quar
ters of an hour later to learn the num
ber of the girl's room. <
At Amy's former home yesterday her
sister Winnie found three pages of senti
mental poetry written by the girl
Just before she died. It spoke of her "lost
love" and the coldness of writing com
pared with words.
On the afternoon of the day on which
Miss Murphy's death occurred Poulin
worked at he Eisner Company's office, ac
cording to his statement. He left there
about 5 o'clock, got his dinner and was
then at the White House saloon, 114 Sut
ter street, up to nearly 11 o'clock, when
he went to his room.
RUMOR IS BUSY
WITH THE HEW
POLICE BOARD
It Will Meet This
Evening.
NOTHING EXCITING EXPECTED
SULLIVAN IS WILLING TO BE
THE NEW CHIEF.
It Is Reported That Mayor Phelan
Has Accepted Thomas' Resigna
tion and Will Name His
Successor.
%
The Police Commission meets to-night,
and despite the belief based on the ex
citing termination of the last session of
the board, iae chances are that nothing
out of the ordinary will occur. Commis
sioner Thomas, who produced most of the
fireworks on that occasion. Is out of town
and will not be present.
It is quite possible that the Mayor may
notify the board that he has accepted the
resignation of Commissioner Thomas,
which has been in his hands for ten days.
It is also possiule that he may name that
gentleman's successor. In fact, rumor
wa6 buey yesterday with this bit of gos-
Kip. it being stated as a certainty that
the Mayor had gone so far as to confide
to several intimates that he had accepted
the resignation and decided on Mr. Thom
as' successor.
Rumor was also busy with the name of
Colonel W. P. Sullivan Jr.. the jlayor's
secretary, as the probable successful can
didate for Chief of Police, the Esola, alias
Harrington, person being conceded to be
utterly out of the question. Colonel Sul
livan, although never an avowed candi
date, does not deny that the position
would be grateful to him..
"I am not what you might call a
etraight-out candidate for the position."
he 6aid yesterday when Informed of the
rumor, "but I will say I would gladly ac
cept It if it were offered to me."
This statement of Colonel Sullivan's gives
some color to the belief that there will be
"somethin" doin" " to-night. It is known
that a week ago last night Mayor Phelan.
absolutely flabbergasted and disgusted at
the public exposure of Esola's unntness for
the place, announced that Colonel Sulli
van was his candidate. The Esolaites,
discouraged by the previous exposure,
were dumfounded when they heard of this
etep. They elept on their arms during
the night and. refreshed by morning and
spurred on by desperation, they made a
last attack on the Mayor, threatening, ca
joling, persuading him to stay bought.
Their logic, even if enforced with a club,
had the desired effect and Sullivan was
withdrawn from the fight.
Since that time matters. Instead of
mending, have grown worse for the plot
ter*, until the burden has become unbear
able. The modestly announced candidacy
of Colonel Sullivan, "I would gladly ac
cept if It were offered to mo," is taken
as the first indication that an effort will
be made to shift the burden.
The Mayor's intentions regarding Police
Commissioner Biggy are shrouded in
more mystery than ever. Commissioner
Thomas' announcement at last Tuesday's
meeting that Mr. Phelan had authorized
him to say that Biggy would be ousted
oefore yesterday has not been borne out
Dy the results. The day after it was made
by the lawyer Commissioner. Mayor Phe
lan took occasion to say practically that
Mr. Thomas had exceeded his powers.
It may be that the Mayor may. even In
the face of strong public opinion, remove
Mr. Biggy It he does he will do so to
night. To all questioners yesterday con
cerning matters pertaining to the Police
Commission he said it would meet to-night
and whatever would be done would be
known.

PHELAN'S WILL
IS SUPERIOR TO
A CHARTER LAW
Financial System Has
Been Changed.
SAFEGUARDS THROWN ASIDE
MAYOE'S CZAB-LIKE POLICY
AGAIN MANIFEST.
Freeholder Clement Declares That No
Executive Officer Should Pre
sume to Override a Fun
damental Law.
THIS matter was fully
discussed in the Charter
Convention by such men
as ex- Auditor Colin M. Boyd,
ex-Auditor and ex-State Con
trrller John P. Dunn, ex-Su
pervisor Stewart Menzies, ex-
Supervisor Denman and ex-
Mayors Pond and Ellert, all of
whom had had long experience
in the affairs of the city, and
all of whom had more or less
to do with the discussion
which led to the financial
scheme adopted by the Char
ter Convention and subse
quently carried into the char
ter with very little, if any,
alteration by those of us who
were elected Freeholders. I
would not assume in the least
degree the prerogative of
changing the requirements of
the charter, for that is our '
fundamental law, and no ex
ecutive officer would certainly
take the responsibility of set
ting aside the fundamental
law of the city. â Attorney
Henry N. Clement in an in
terview.
Mayor Phelan has set up a new fee sys
tem. The charter law has been super
seded by the Phelan will. According to
the charter provisions an officer receiving
a fee has to make out a receipt for the
person who pays it, a duplicate for the
dally settlement with the Treasurer and
a triplicate to be given the Auditor at the
end of the month, when the stubs are
turned in. The Treasurer has been obliged
to make out a receipt for each fee paid
in to him, which he turns over to the
Auditor, and at the end of the month the
Auditor compares the stub books with
the receipts he has received from the
Treasurer.
Treasurer Brooks decided that this was
too much trouble and complained to the
Mayor, who concluded that it would fully
satisfy the "spirit of the charter require
ments" for the Treasurer to send the
Auditor a list of receipts turned over to
him, instead of making a duplicate for
each slip of paper. He further author
ized the giving of a single receipt for sev
eral items by any official who sftould take
a number of fees at oue time from the
same person.
While the charter is very exacting as
regards the routine of fee handling.
Mayor Phelan has decided that his solu
tion satisfies the "spirit of charter re
quirements" and therefore should be
adopted. The absurdity and presumption
displayed by an executive official in not
only interpreting but changing charter
requirements is shown in the following
interview with Attorney Henry N. Cle
ment, a member of the Board of Free
holders:
"Section 35, article 16 of the new charter
provides that when any officer, board or
department finds it necessary in order
properly to conduct official business to
have more assistance, he should so inform
the Mayor. Upon investigation, if the
Mayor decides such to be so, he may rec
ommend that the Supervisors permit the
employment of such additional clerks or
assistants, and by an affirmative vote of
not less than fourteen members it may be
authorized."
"This provision comes under the head
of that portion of the charter marked
'Miscellaneous Business,' and provides
for certain contingencies which might
arise when the charter should be put into
operation. One of the first contingencies
we thought might arise was that in the
reorganizing of the various departments
more work might be imposed upon the
various officers or boards than had been
calculated upon. Therefore section 5 was
inserted to meet just such a contingency
Now, I have recently found by going to
the Treasurer's office he was complaining
that the charter caused his clerks to be
overworked by imposing so much detail
in the matter of small receipts. He want
ed to know of me what should be done.
1 immediately referred him to section 35,
article XVI, and told him to call the mat
ter to the attention of the Mayor. Mr
Brooks said he could not see the necessity
of so much detail in email matters, the
importance of which was not commensu
rate with the trouble Imposed. I told him
I did not see how he could fall to comply
with the provisions of the charter with
out setting it aside entirely, which of
course no one would be authorized to do.
I then said to him: 'General Grant once
said the best way to make a law obnox
ious is to enforce It in its entirety.'
Therefore, said I, carry out the provisions
of the charter precisely as they are writ
ten and the blame will not rest upon you.
If your force of employes is not large
enough to do it, then fall back upon sec
tion 35 of article XVI and get additional
deputies from the Supervisors.
"The financial system embodied In the
charter was originally drafted by a com
mittee In the Charter Convention of One
Hundred, headed by ex-Auditor John P.
Dunn, .who is also ex-State Controller, a
man we all thought to be thoroughly con
versant with the subject. He was a man
in whom we all had great faith, and I
know that this very system of checks
upon the Treasurer, involving the entry
of all the receipts of which the Treas
urer now complains, was a part of the
system devised by Mr. Dunn and his com
mittee to keep the Treasurer's office un
der such checks as were thought neces
sary for so important an office.
"The matter was fully discussed in the
Charter Convention by such men as ex-
Auditor Colin M. Boyd, ex-Supervisor
Stewart Menzies, ex-Supervisor Denman
and ex-Mayors Pond and Ellert, all of
whom had had long experience In the af
fairs of the city and all of whom had
more or less to do with the discussion
which led to the financial scheme adopted
by the Charter Convention, and subse
quently carried Into the charter with
very little if any alteration by those of
us who were elected Freeholders.
"I would not assume the prerogative of
changing in the least degree the require
ments of the charter, for that Is our
fundamental law, and no executive officer
would certainly take the responsibility of
setting aside the fundamental law of the
city."
