VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. 12.â The Cans,
dlan Government has accepted British Co>
lumbla's offer of a company of mounted
scouts for South African service.
It is probable that Clery had [
orders to begin his attack as soon
as the Springfield position had !
been turned and Buller had se
cured the drift. Everything
looks as if a decisive movement
and determined effort to clear!
the way to Ladysmith had been i
begun, an effort on which the Â¦
whole issue of the Natal cam
paign depends. Perhaps a se
ries of engagements may take
place on both the right and left j
of the Boer lines.
The list of casualties at Lidy
smith issued by the War Officer
totals 420. The proportion killed j
to wounded is unusually heavy, i
nearly a third. Among the of
ficers who lost their lives were
two of the most popular â Lord
Ava, son of the Marquis of Duf
ferin, and Colonel Dick-Cunyng
ham, the gallant Gordon High
lander.
The death list from enteric
fever and dysentery at Lady
smith, averaging from eight to
ten daily, is considered more
serious than the 420 casualties of
Saturday's fight, as they indi
cate the frightful sanitary condi
tion of the beleaguered town. A
letter from Ladysmith, dated De
cember 7, says that even then 90
out of 540 men in the battalion
of which the writer is a member
were sick with dysentery or en

KITCHENER THE REAL
CHIEF IN SOUTH AFRICA
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted. ISOO, by James Gordon
Bennett.
LOXDOX. Jan. 13.â 1t now leaks out
that Lord Kitchener Is really the chief
In South Africa at the head of the Brit
ish troops, and Lord Roberts a figure
head. It happened thus: The national
defense committee met and decided that
Lord kitchener was the man for the
place. He was Lord Salisbury's nomina
tion. The Premier had made a study of
Lord Kitchener on the occasion of the
Sirdar's visit to Hatfield. but endless dif
ficulties were In the wayl Â¦ ;_â¢ â¢
Two months ago I told you the rumor
that Lord Kitchener would go out. and
the Herald and The Call were absolutely
the first papers to forecast the possibility,
which has now become a fact. The mat
ter Was then under discussion, but the
trouble was that Lord Kitchener was the
junior of Generals Buller, Warren and
others.
But Lord Salisbury Is never beaten upon
a technicality, and his solution of the
problem was to send Lord Roberts. He
will restore the confidence of the men
by his presence as field marshal, while
Lord Kitchener, being his aid, will en
able the latter under cover of his supe
rior in authority to conduct the cam
paign. The general opinion is that the
Idea Is not bad.
IMPERIAL VOLUNTEERS
RECEIVE THEIR KITS
LONDON*. Jan. 12.â There was a unique
and interesting ceremony at ths Guildhall
v ONDON, Jan. 12.â The War Office this morning received the following dis
| patch from General Buller, dated Springfield, Thursday, January 11, at
"^Â¦"^ 9:20 o'clock, evening:
4t l occupied the south bank of the Tugela River at Potgieters Drift this
morning and seized Pont. The river is in flood. The enemy is strongly en
trenched about Tour and a haif miles to the north."
Apart from the definite news that General Buller has attempted a second
time to cross the Tugela River the only news is the list of casualties among
the British officers in the fight at Ladysmith Saturday, January 6, showing
thirteen killed and twenty-seven wounded. Among the latter was Lieutenant
Colonel William Henry Dick-Cunyngham, V. C. f commander of the Second Bat
talion of the Gordon Highlanders since 1897. who. has since succumbed to his
wounds. The War Office announces the British casualties at Ladysmith, Janu
ary 6, among the rank and file, were 135 killed and 242 wounded.
It is officially announced that the Earl of Ava has died of his wounds.
The Earl died without recovering consciousness.
night among society people and
in military circles close to the
War Office that General Buller
was in motion. No confirmation
could then be obtained, and the
War Office was silent up to noon
yesterday, when the official dis
patch was given out showing
that on Thursday the British
forces moved westward to Pot
gieters Drift, seized the -point
and located the Boers four and a
half miles to the north. Pot
gieters Drift is not .marked on
any known map, but it is known
to be about fifteen miles west of
Colenso and is due north of
Springfield, from which Gen
eral Buller's telegram was sent.
General Buller must refer to
the great â not the little â Tu
gela when he says he has occu
pied the south bank.
The Boers are believed to hold
the junction of the two rivers
and to have a strong position at
Mount Tabanyama, east south
east of Ladysmith, which com
mands the approach to Potgiet
ers Drift.
A glance at the map will show
the significance of the British
move. General Buller was said
a short time ago to be construct
ing a railway toward Springfield.
It was also reported that the bulk
of his forces had retired to Frere,
the available troops sent to make
a demonstration under General
Clery, when Ladysmith was at
tacked, being only 10,000, or
munication with the besieged
garrison, for White's advanced
posts are two or three miles from
camp on either side of the road.
Although nothing has been .al
lowed to come through from Co
lenso or Frere since Tuesday,
and then dispatches all bore signs
of being severely censored, it is
probable that General Clery or
General Hiklyard has been left to
attack or "menace Hlangwane
Hill, while this turning move
ment has been in progress, or,
perhaps, make a strong demon
stration toward Colenso.
If the Boers there can be pre
vented from coming to the help
of their right flank by the imme
diate peril in front of them, the
British troops at Potgieters
Drift will find their work easier.
There is one point, however, that
must be considered. Unless the
Boers evacuated Springfield
General Buller has that force
threatening his rear, as well as
commandos south of Dewdrop
before him. A movement upon
the Boer right threatens the en
emy's line of communication
with the Orange Free State and
should bring on a battle imme
diately.
General Buller means to fight;
that is certain. The chief ob
stacle in his path for the moment
is the Tugela 'River, but the
floods go down as rapidly as
they rise.
Important information bearing
on this point is contained in a
dispatch from the Daily Tele
graph's war correspondent, who
reports in a message dated Tues
day that a heavy storm, with
rain, had filled the rivers and
spruits full of water. This ac
cords with . what Buller says of
the state of the Tugela at Pot
gieters Drift on Thursday.
The correspondent also states
that the Boers who were holding
Mount Hlangwane were now
quite isolated, as their bridge
over the Tugela must have been
carried away. If this is the case
an ... assault .on this mountain
is extremely likely. Should the
British be successful they will
have established themselves on
both flanks of the Boers, with a
chance of inflicting heavy loss.
about one-third of his army.
It now appears probable that
15,000 men have either utilized
the branch railway line or have
marched from Frere by the road
which ieaves Doornkop on the
right, and after running eighteen
miles in a northwesterly direction
crosses the Little Tugela and
reaches Springfield. Thence a
march of eight miles due north
would bring them to Potgieters
Drift, on the Tugela proper,
where they have established
themselves on the southern bank.
If, as it was reported, the Boers
were strongly intrenched at
Springfield, where they had
mounted one or two long guns,
it would seem that their position
was evaded by a night march.
At Potgieters Drift General
Buller has the main Boer in
trenchments away on the right.
If he can maintain himself there
he seriously threatens the safety
of Joubert's right 'flank. The
river before him, he reports, is in
flood, but as he probably has his
Royal Engineers with their pon
toon trains this will not seriously
retard him. His immediate op
ponents are four and a half miles
north, guarding, no doubt, the
road which leads to Roodespoort
and Dewdrop. From the . drift
to the latter place, is about ten
miles, and Ladysmith itself is
only' eight miles further off.
Once at -Dewdrop the reliev
ing force would be in close com-

eleven general and minor engagements, and several important expeditions,
twice winning special mention in the dispatches, besides a medal with two
clasps and a bronze star and the Victoria cross. He served with distinction in
the Transvaal war cf 1881, when a part of his battalion were so badly defeated
and cut up at Majuba Hill. From ISS3 to ISSS he served as adjutant of the
auxiliary forces in India. In ISO 3-94 he was staff officer (first class) in Bengal
and later D. A. A. General of Bengal. He came with contingent from In

that could be obtained up to mid

Th*Â» ship is a two-masted steamer c.f
nearly 30n0 tons and probably carried a

on Thursday, striking a ledg? at the foot
of the cliff, where e.Â«caj>e was hopeless.

he made his way back to the rigging,
Â¦where he died of exposure during the

from Ncah Bay, stating that the steamer
Eiihu Thomson had just passed out after
Fighting the steamer Elm Branch, dis

the Elm Branch a hawser, but soon after

A dispatch was received during- the

POLICE DECLARE MRS.
CORSE WAS TO BLAME
Disposed to Cast Doubt Upon the San
Francisco Elocutionist's Story
of Robbery.
sr*<:lal Dlspatca U The- Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â The police deny that
Mrs. John Corse, the San Francisco elocu
tionist.* was robbed of money and dia
monds, as phe alleges. They admit ghe
lost her rings snd other Jewels and prob
ably her pur?e, but say the fault was her
own, and the man arrtsteti for taking
them will not be prosecuted.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Corse, who. while attending a Chicago
school of dramatic expression, is living
with friends at 233 Dearborn avenue, she
took dinner with friends on Wednesday
and remained with them until 11 o'clock,
when she called a cab to go home. -Arriv
ing at the Dearborn-avenue residence, she
dismissed the cabman and went to her
apartments, to discover that she had for
gotten to have a prescription tilled. Think
ing to catch the cabman, rushed
downstairs, but the vehicle was a block
away.
As Butts' drugstore, at Clark and Chest
nut street, was only a block from her
home, and the street was well lighted, she
thought she could walk the few steps In
safety. On her return, when in the middle
of the block, three men sprang from thg
shadow of a building and commanded her
to give them hrr diamonds and pecket
book. She hesitated a moment and then,
recovering herself, screamed. One of the
men grabbed her and placed a nar.d over
her mouth, drew her into the shadow, of
the building to get her out of sight cf
passing pedertrians on Clark strrtt. and
told one of his companions to call a cab
which was standing around the corner on
Clark street.
This is the last Mrs. Corse remembers.
She cays that while the cab was being
driven around a handkerchief on which
was something with a nauseating odor
was placed to hr-r nose and she became
uncenhciojs. When she regained her
senses sbe was in a back room in a ealcon
on Division street, near Clark. The set
tings '.n the rings and the brooch she
wore at her threat had been cut cut and
her pocketbook was missing. IIÂ«t face,
ri^ck and hands were badly bruised.
The police refuse to discuss the case
further than here outlined, and Mrs.
Corse will not see newspaper men. So far
as the police are concerned the incident is
closed.
MOB THREATENS
ST. LOUIS DELEGATES
Failure to Pass the Electric Light
Contract Causes a Small
Riot.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. 12.â The agitation
caused by the failure of the St. Louis
HOOK of Delegates to contract for elec
tric lighting- for the alleys, parks and
city institutions culminated to-day in a
demonstration by citfzens at the doors
leading to the Delegate floor such as has
never fee-en witnessed before in the City
Hall. A crowd numbering several hun
dred completely filled the corridors lead
ing to the Delegates' chamber. They
howled? hooted and hissed and at times
threatened to break in the doors lead
ing to the Delegates' floor. Alfred Llfo,
a page of the House, was. assaulted. At
one time a revolver -was drawn by the
sergeant at arms of the House, Henry L.
Weeks, who guarded the door loading to
the Delegates' floor, and several times,
before the arrival of the police, it looked
as though bloodshed could not be averted.
ThÂ» ai rival of the police sergeant and
a sfjuad. together with a speech to th-e
crowd from ex-Governor Stannard, cau
tioning them to commit no overt act. had
the effect of quelling | the disturbance.
To-n:e;ht the situation in the different in

These men were the remainder of the
party of twenty-one persons who had
started from Edmonton for the Klondike
over that death trap in the fall of 1537. A
portion of the party which became sepa

they were journeying, having taken diver

and ultimately all had arrived or been ac-

VIEWS IN NORTHERN CAPE COLONY.
This Is the section in which Generals French and Gatacre are operating.
The former on the Midland railroad lino had "ten days ago advanced as far
as Colesberg, from which the Boers retired and he reported its capture. The
appearance of the enemy on the hill overlooking the town deterred him
from entering it, however; and the two forces have since been maneuvering
In Its vicinity, with frequent skirmishes, and the loss to the British a few
days ago of over a hundred officers and men of the Suffolk Regiment, includ
ing its commander. Lieutenant Colonel Watson, who was mortally wounded
In a surprise attack which he had planned.
Queenstown, General Gatacre's base, lies on the Eastern railroad line,
running from East London to the Orange River. To the northwest of the
town lies Stormberg Pass and near it Stormberg Junction, where the British
made the disastrous attempt 'to surprise the Boers on December 10 last which
resulted in the loss of nearly 700 men.
the position to be taken they, uncon
sciously found themselves closed in and
lit^ihat formation attempted the ascent,
fne fire directed upon them was terrible,
distinguished by their swords, the
ofljeers were first to fall. Colonel Ethel
stan was mortally wounded fifty yards
from the first slope, and one by one the
rest fell as they advanced, many with
two or three bullet wounds. The slaugh
ter was appalling to watch; the gal
lantry displayed was useless under the
pitiless Iron hail that was but slightly
checked by the redoubled shelling of the
reinforced battery. With a cheer the
Yorkshire menâ by a curious coincidence
they had been convoyed from Mauritius
by the very men to whose, help they now
came â advanced under a tremendous
fusillade toward the crest of the Sangar.
Of course they lost heavily, but their
open formation and the Impossibility of
distinguishing officers, saved them from
the concentrated fire that had deprived
the naval detachment of their leaders,
and little by little the thin line of khaki
crawled up to the top.
"The storming line was now so near
the crest that the guns could only be
directed upon the Boers enfilading the
position from the Bpurs of the kopje on
the left. Lieutenant S. C. Taylor, closely
followed by Lieutenant Jones of the Ma
rines, reached the outer works of the
Sangar and made their way over.
"In tho next half-minute fifty men
tumbled over and Immediately rushed
over to clear the position In the rear.
This was, however, held for a quarter of
an hour more, perhaps as a screen more
than anything else to cover the retreat
of the Boers. Above, the hilltop was al
most dripping with blood; not a bowlder
escaped its splash of crimson, and the
innumerable splinters and chips of iron
stone blocks indicated the terrific nature
of our fire. Most of the dead or wound
ed Boers were carried offâ the more se
verely injured were found in their hos
pital, a quarter of a mile awayâ but here
and there a dead man proved that here
the Transvaal had sent its men down for
the first time to meet the oncoming col
umn."

DENOUNCES THE GREED
AND RAPACITY OF BRITONS
HARTFORD, Conn.. Jan. 12.â Professor
Arthur M. Wheeler of Yale University
spoke In denunciation of the attitude of
the British in South Africa toward tho
Boers in a lecture given' to-night In the
South School Hall. His subject was
"England and the Transvaal." He said
that whatever be the result of the pres
ent contest, the British must lose in the
end. Living on the islands .' and sur
rounded by an . almost impassable
wall, the English go through the
world as If there was nobody else In
existence. The Dutch element was pre
dominant when the English took posses
sion of what Is now Cape Colony, The
Boers were forced back Into the Interior.
The Boers cultivated the soil and estab
lished institutions, but the English came
in and took the fruits of their labor. One
of the grievances of the English against
the Boers Is that the. latter will "not live
under British rule, which Is an unpardon
able sin in England. He sharply criti
cl7ed the manner In which the English ob
tained possession of the Kimberley dia
mond fields, and attributed all her inter
ference in the Transvaal and Orange Free
State affairs to greed and rapacity. Other
claims made by the English were only
excuses.
DISSATISFIED WITH
ENGLAND'S LONG DELAY
BERLIN, Jan. 12.â There is stiH great
dissatisfaction in Germany at Great Brit
ain's long delay in releasing the Bundes
rath and in sending a formal answer to
Germany's protest.
A high official at' the Foreign Office
latest pamphlet, issued to-day, deals with
"American Naval Regeneration," praising
the energy shown and admiring the man
ner in which "this joyous, vigorous and
lively nation plants the star-spangled
banner In every nook of the globe."
The war In South Africa continues to be
a subject of elaborate comment In the
German press. The Mllltair Wochenblatt,
the military organ, declares its expecta
tion that Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchen
er, having arrived at the Cape, things will
henceforth "mend for the British."
The German diamond industry is being
seriously injured by the war. In Hanau
four large diamond-cutting establishments
have been closed.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â Mail advices
just received from London state
that the British war correspond
ents are pouring In through the
mails columns of descriptions of
operations In South Africa. Those recent
ly printed refer chiefly to the battles of
Gras Pan and Modder River, for It is yet
too early for the publication of fuller ac
counts of Buller's defent at Colonso. The
Times' correspondent at Modder River
has written a graphic account of the
long, fierce battle that takes Its name
from that river. "For the whole of the
day." he writes, "the Guards brigade lay
on the open veldt In a heat that was act
ually 110 degrees in the shade at midday.
While the left flank had not been Idle and
after the general had personally led them
to the summit of a slljrht rise that com
manded the only possible means of cross
ing the riverâ the dam that had been built
f turn the Modder River into an orna
mental water for the picnics of Kimberley
excursionistsâ they moved in echelon to
ward the edge of the river bank on the
enemy's extreme left.
"That it Jeould even be attempted to
cross the river sliding sideways through
the rush of water over the paddles of a
rickety iron bar, one by one clinging to the
short supports in full view of the opposite
shores, was an act of reckless heroism
against which even the wary Cronje ha<t
not provided. Thla, however, is what was
actually done, and it would be difficult
to find a parallel of the stubborn pluck of
the men who accompanied Colonel Barter
across the* 300 yards of dam and weir. One
by one some 400 of them crossed. Then a
detachment of the Royal Engineers, show
ing how well they could take thcic part in
the forefront of the fighting line, followed
them; after that some more of the York
shire Infantry. Little by little tho force
was collected which cleared several of
the nearest houses or. the right and ef
fected an occupation of an Irrigation path
from which they were ne ( ver dislodged.
To fight for thirteen hours Is an ordeal
that In ordinary warfare would be a
terrible strain, but on the treeless, shade
less veldt, with the thermometer at the
degree above mentioned, the exhaustion
suffered by our men was so great that
in hundreds of cases men and officers
alike slept as they lay in the scrub, care-,
less of the shell and rifle fire that surged
over them. To provide them food was
Impossible; to bring a water-cart on the
field, as the Coldstream Guards found by
bitter experience, was only tempting men
to expose themselves to death, rushing
for the water at all hazards and leaving
the cover, such as it was, afforded by
the nine or ten inch growth of mimosa
scrub.
"Early in the afternoon the general was
shot through the thigh, and for some time
the two brigades, in the absence of orders,
were compelled to act Independently of
each other, the only communication holm?
a warning to the Ninth Brigade not to
fire upon the First, of which there was
some danger.
"The magnificent manner In which the
Boors had realized and augmented the
strength of the position, the success with
which they had kept their works and dis
position secret until the crucial moment,
the feint by which they drew
off the entire artillery strength of
our force from their main position, and
the astonishing accuracy of their picked
shots at the longest ranges should all be
remembered to the credit of their gener
als. But it was in the material which
formed the commando that they failed.
They could do no more than they actually
did with the men under their command.
Already jealousies had sprung up between
the generals, the men accused each other
of cowardice and the threat of physical
force had, if rumors were true, to be held
over them more than once.
"The one-pounder' Maxim gun was the
most effective weapon used by the Boers.
The five and six pound shots fired in one
Becond while the gun was traversed had
more moral effect than the steady dis
charge of shrapnel of the ordinary fifteen
pounder at half-minute Intervals. One
man not far from me had both thighs
blown off as he -sat by one of these little
shells landing on tho ground between
them, but there ia no question that the
moral effect was, as a rule, greater than
the practical results. No gun was more
cordially disliked by our men than, this
new weapon, that was usually christened
'Bong-bong-bong,' the patent of which in
1802 was offered to and declined by our
Government." . .. v^.'vv ,V
Of the lessons to be learned from Mod
der River this correspondent says: â¢ ',
"It would be impossible in any future war
for the officers to retain their swords, and
It will be worth while for the War Ofllce
to construct some light carbine that may
be carried by them. Instead of the weighty
rifle served out to the men."
The scene after the battle is thus de
scribed by the same writer:
"Most people who have stayed at Klm
berley know of Modder River as a crea
tion, only thinking of it, in fact, much as
London regards Maidenhead. Never has
it been anything but a frivolous little
patch in the heart of the veldt. The pun.
ishment for its giddiness has been sudden
and extraordinary. The place Is deserted,
the walls and roofs are perforated like a
colander;; the ."water, churned and be
fouled by 10,300 animals, rolls over and
o_ver the dead that were hurriedly thrown
ihto its eddying hollows with a weight at
tached; that has in many cases proved in
sufficient. Tho bridge lies on Its ruined
piers a twisted length, of scraplron, and
the dead horses fill every nook in the riv
erside woods.
"The. chapel, with Us little wooden
cross, near the river, stood in the thick
of the fight, and now Hc3 a crumbling
mass of adobe walls, with its shattered
earthen a. or and most of its seats.
NOT THE VICTIM
OF A NIGHTMARE
Alfred Morrison Charged
With Murder.
NEW YORK. Jan. 12.â Alfred Morrison,
who shot and killed one of his wives, with
whom he was living in Mount Vernon. is
under arrest. Crowds waited around his
house all day in anticipation of the ar
rest, and they followed Morrison, who
was in charge of two detectives, to the
Courthouse, where he was arraigned and
held to the Grand Jury on the charge of
murder in the tirst^degree.
Morrison on the night of December 28
shot his wife Alida and she died the fol
lowing day. He appeared to be grief
stricken over the attnir and told a pitiful
tale of how the shooting was the result
of fright occasioned by a dream of burg
lars. The woman herself, knowing that
death was certain, said that the shooting
was accidental and attributed it to the
same cause as Morrison did. The Coro
ner's jury exonerated him.
Some days later Morrison's original
wife,- whom he married many years ago
under the name of Gordon, gave out the
information that the man was a bigamist
and had practically abandoned her, and
since then facts tending to place Morri
son in a bad light have been developed.
The police have been watching Morrison
ever since, and It was rumored that Mor
rison was acting like a crazy man. When
he was placed under arrest to-day, how
ever, he was very Quiet and perfectly
composed.
Judgre Appell aaid that the depositions
and ether papers in the case did not show
that any crime had been committed; or.
if any crime had been committed, that
the prisoner at the bar had committed
one. He then moved that the case be dis
missed and the prisoner discharged.
Judge Schatz denied this motion, and
Judge Appell said he would waive ex
amination and that the prisoner would
stand committed to await the action of
the Grand Jury. Morrison was committed
to jail without bail. The next Grand Jury
will assemble in White Plains on the first
Monday In February.
District Attorney Andrews to-day
claimed that he had sufficient evidence to
prove that Morrison, in shooting his wife,
committed a deliberate and premeditated
murder. - 1

AGED MAN

Threatened With Evic

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUBALITO. Jan. 12.-The alleged vic
tim of schemers and deserted by husband
and children, Mrs. Campbell, an aged
woman of this town, is vainly seeking for
aid and counsel.
The property which was hers she claims
has vanlehed and now her divorced hus
band threatens her with eviction from

homestead, but owing to a mistake In
making out the deed. John was named

the children. Mrs. Campbell claims that
during his guardianship he, unknown to
her sold the property to Dorcas Camp
bell, her divorced husband's sister. The
old woman says that she knew nothing
of this until a short time ago when, on
going to pay her taxes, she learned that
her few acres had vanished. When she
heard the truth she almost went out of
her mind. Her enemies claim that since
then she has not been right and that her
statements are irresponsible.

Bhe is reduced is proven by her raceed

The thieves were two brothers named

DEPUTIES SEARCHING
FOR MURDEROUS TRAMP
No Talk of Lynching in the Neigh
borhood of Stevens
v Creek.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 12.â Sheriff Langford
and some deputies are in the hills on
Stevens Creek to-day investigating the
shooting of little Louisa Cornu, which !3
said to have been done by a tramp Mon
day, when he was attacked by the 14
year-old brother of the child, after the
tramp had attempted to assault her.
Whatever may be the facts of the shoot-
Ing there 13 no excitement in the neigh
borhood nor threats of lynching. The
officers all agree to this. The Sheriff
and his deputies have been busy in the
chase, running down tramps ever since
the matter was reported. None of these
has been identified by the boy. While
the officers are reticent, it is a fact that
they are not entirely witlsfled with the
story that a tramp did the shooting.
Late last night the police arrested a
tramp who gives his name as Sullivan
and he Is held pending an Investigation.
The Cornu boy will be brought here to
face Sullivan. A conveyance has been
sent to the hills for this purpose. Sulli
van has been rather conflicting in his
statements.

COLONEL MAZUMA'S
MONTANA OPERATIONS
Sack Used in the Clark Senatorial
Contest Appears to Have Been
Bottomless.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12.â There were
again four or five witnesses before the
Benate Committee on Privileges and Elec
â¢tlons to-day in connection with the at
tack upon the right of Senator Clark of
Montana to his beat in the Senate. One
of the witnesses. State Senator Myers,
produced a letter from C. W. Clark, son
of the Senator, telling him (Meyers) he
had forwarded $100 as a retainer for him
es attorney in connection with the coal
Interests of the Clarks. A dentist named
Ector also displayed letters from Senator
Clark himself referring to W. M, Bick
fcrd as a representative of his and stating
that while he (.Clark) knew nothing of
Ector's claims for services his policy was
to remunerate all that served him.
Probably the most important witness of
the <Jay was H. H. Garr, a member of
the Legislature, who had voted for Clark
for the Senate. He is one cf the men in
whose name money was turned over to
the State. Garr said while this moneyâ
Ijo^D in $1000 billsâ had been shown to him
by Whiteside and he had marked the en
velope containing It Whitesido had not
raid anything to him about voting for
Clark.
The committee began its session to-day
Â«:th a request from the prosecution to
have the books of the Thomas Cruse Sav
ings Bank at Helena, Mont., showing the
deposits of A. J. Davidson and a man
named Toole, brought befoii the commit
tee. The original subpena had only called
lor the deposit slips. The point was not
i.Â«"ciued.
ii. L. P. Ector. a dentist at Mlssoula.
\Â»as the first witness. He had participated
in the campaign In Havalii County In the
Interest of t. P. Wood, who was the Dem
ocratic candidate for the Legislature 'n
the last campaign, and a friend of Clark,
fcetor said he had acted at the instance of
Bickford, one of Clark's managers. Let
ters rrom Bickford were exhibited. In one
of these, written after the legislative elec
tion. Kickford referred to the presence of
"our friend" in Hamilton and asked Ector
to ascertain his tinar.ciai condition. Kctor
eaid "our friend" was Wood a.nd that he
replied to this letter sayins that his in
debtedness was JGSOU. ami that $7000 woulJ
probably be necessary to fettle all his
debts. Afterward Bickford had given him
J7'.Â«.i3 to give to Wood. He had then refused
to accept the money, teJling Bickford It
was "all off," us Wood had told him that
he could not afford to sell himself.
ThÂ« witness said that liickford had
promised to pay him for his services, but
that no specific sum had been mentioned.
"He asked me how much I expected,"
ha;d the witness, "and I tuld him I wanted
all I could get out of It. X continued by
paying: 'So doubt you will make a stake
out ot it.' He asked me how 10 per cent
would rio. I said: 'That would be satis
lactory. as I have no doubt vuu will get
f^-t.OoO or $25.00u out of it.' "
It appeared that no settlement was
rnaSe ulth him by Bickford and that
bCtor wrote to Senator Clark about
the matter. There was a correspondence
*vith that gentleman, beginning December
10. IKfc, and closing November 8, ISSJ.
These loners were read to j-how that
Bkkford had been the agent of Clark ill
the Senatorial race. In the lirst letter
Clark said that the matter concerning
which Bctor had written him had Lee'i
It ft entirely in the hands of Bickford, and
that he would confer with that gentleman
concerning It.
In the second letter, dated January >S.
KG, Clark spoke of the fact that he had
Just, been ejected, sayinjr Bickford was
wild with joy. adding that, while he had
no personal knowledge as to what he had
done, he "never disappointed any one who
had ht-Sped him."
The !aÂ«t statement was practically re
peated from Paris In April last, and In an
other Utter, written from New York on
November * last. In the New York letter
Clark taid he would refer Ector's matter
t" Bickford. ai;d in the Paris letter he
traid It was his desire "that ar.y one who
served him should be amply remuner
ated." One of the letters of the scri-s
was signed in typewriter, and the defense
objected to its admission. This objection
brought out the first division in the com
mittee. Senators McComas and Caffety
casting the only votes against admission.
Cross-examination was postponed until
the defense should look up the letters n.
co'.ved from Kctor.
Representative P. G. Sullivan, a mem
ber of the last Montana Legislature from
Granite County, testified that he had bern
approached by Bickford when he wen:
to Helena, previous to the meeting of the
Lf-riflature, and asked to vote for Clark.
"I eai-V' the witness testified, "thai I
might do so if there was enough in it. He
askÂ«-d how much. I said $2<j.000. He then
i - r Â¦ Â¦: me if half that amount would net
be enough. I replied 'No,' and we sepa
rated."
Sullivan caJd that afterward he acain
met Bickford an<i the latter Fuggesied
515.000. He told Bickford then that he
would not vote for Clark under any cir
cumstances, and saw no more of him.
Sullivan sa'.d his purpose had been to
lead Bickford on, and that he had not
expected to vote for Clark, even if the
, offer of $20,000 had been accepted. The
| witness said that he was now the pro
prietor of the Florence Hotel at Butte.
and the cross-examination was devoted
to showing that this hotel is owned large
ly by Marcus Daly. The witness said M
paid his rent to Mr. Hennessey, and did
not know whether or not Daly was the
owr.tr. He admitted that his patronage
was largely from among the miners of
the Anaconda mine, and counsel brought
I out the fact that, whereas, before the
| Legislature met the witness had been the
' proprietor of a saloon, paying $30 a month,
! he now pays $2000 a month for the Flor-
Anthony Dougherty of Helena proved to
be the llrst witness who was apparently
unwilling to testify. He was called with
the view of showing that he had allowed
a friend named Gallagher to occupy for
several days a room In the Brown block,
rented by himself, and that he had re
mained in the closet of the room and
ovocheard a conversation between A. J.
Steele and Representatives Gillette and
Flynn concerning the Senatorial election.
Dougherty declared that he had not re
mained in the closet and had heard no
such conversation, answering only "yes"
or "no" In reply to questions. He said he
had let Gallagher take the room and had
lived elsewhere while Gallagher occupied
it, but that he had seen or heard no one
there.
State Auditor Polndexter testified that
A. J. Steele had promised to give him
JoO.OOO to recure the vote of the three
members of the Legislature from IJeaver
head County for Clark, he (Polndexter) to
have $-5000 for his services, but that he
had never approached the members, be
cause he was opposed to Clark's election
and had agreed to see them for him only
to prevent others acting In the capacity
of go-between.
State Senator Myers was the next wit
ness. He was one of the members who
turned $10,000 over to the legislative com
mittee, stating that It had been put Into
Whiioside's hands for him on the condi
tion that he vote for Clark for Senator.
Myers detailed not only the place of his
takir.g the money, but also other circum
stances leading up to this episode. He
said that he had first been approached
after his election as Senator by Dr. S. W.
Minchall and W. M. Bickford, and his
vote for Clark requested. He had been
told by those men that if he would agree
to vote for Clark the latter would appoint
him attorney in connection with his coal
interests at Bridger. He said he had de
clined this offer, but, notwithstanding
this, he had received a letter from C. W.
Clark, son of the Senator, written from
Butte on December H, IS3S. This letter
was put Into evidence. In it Clark stated
that he had forwarded to Dr. Minchall
SoCQ as a "retainer for his services in the
Bridger coal mine."
Clark, Myers said, had afterward asked
him not to rt-ad the letter before the joint
Legislative Assembly.
Myers said that he had agreed to White
side's proposition to accept $10,000 from
Wellcome only for the purpose of expos-
Ing what he believed were efforts at brib
ery. He said he had received the money
from Whiteside. the latter saying Well
cnnie could not see him then. The witness
said that after the exposure in the Legis
lature be had been persuaded to go to see
A. J. Steele, when the latter, he saJd. had
tried to persuade him iirst to vote for
Clark, next to leave the State until after
the excitement over the Senatorial race
had subsided and, lastly, to sign a state
ment denying his connection with the ex
posure and contradicting his own testi
mony before the legislative committee
In each case Steele had asked him if there
were any inducement or consideration
which would secure his assent, and he
had replied that there was not.
Myers said that Mark Hewitt had of
fered him $10,000 to vote for Clark, saying
Charley Clark had authorized him to
make the proposition. The latter had told
htm. he said, that he could put up $10,000
with Whiteside. to be paid to him In case
he voted lor Clark.
i dp last witness of the day was Henry
E. Garr. a member of the Legislature
from Flathead County, Montana. He is
one of the members of the Legislature in
who-je name money was turned over to
the legislative investigating committee by
Whireside and the only or.o of them who
afte/ward voted for Clark for the Senate.
Inferring to his transactions with
Whiteslde, the witness said Whlteslde had
betn a warm supporter of his and he had
listened respectfully when Whlteside had
asked him to go to his room and had com
plied with his request, when Whlteslde
had apked him to mark for Identification
an envelope containing $5000 In JlOOO bills
which "Whiteside had brought to him at
the Hotel Helena during the session of the
Legislature last winter. He had no rea
son for doing this except his confidence
In W hiteside and the additional fact that
he himself was an "egregious ass." He
had, however, put his initials on the en
velope exhibited yesterday to the com
mittee as the one so marked. He declared
that Whiteside had never said anything
to him about voting for Clark and that
he had kept his promise to Conrad's
friends to vote for Conrad as long' as he
had a chance of election. He pronounced
Judge D. F Smith that he was to vote
for Clark and receive $COOO for so doing
FAVORABLE REPORT ON

visability of delaying action, on the bill
until the Isthmian Canal Commission had
reported, but this was finally regarded as
unnecessary, and all the members except
Fletcher of Mississippi voted to report the
bill favorably. Fletcher Bald his silence
should not be construed as opposition to
the measure, but merely as a reservation
of his right to support or oppose it after
further consideration. The committee
made some changes in the original bill,
inserting a new section 3 and making ver
bal alterations. As finally agreed to the
bill Is as follows:

2POLICE TRACKING
A COUNTERFEITER
Believed to Be Ex-Con
vict Reeves.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 12.â The Identity of
the mysterious stranger who entered a
store here about a week ago and passed
off several counterfeit dollars is at last
established almost beyond all shadow of a
doubt. The man is supposed to be Rich
ard Reeves, a convict, who was dis
charged from San Quentln on January 4.
Reeves had served a three-year sentence
for passing counterfeit money in Los
Angeles. So sure are the authorities that
he is the man that a warrant has been is
sued for his arrest.
On the Bth of January a man entered
the butcher store kept by Otto Smith and
bought a chicken, for which he tendered
a dollar and left the store. Half an hour
later the dollar was found to be a falsa
one. The next day the stranger made his
appearance In Martin's grocery store and
called for a dozen oranges. He was about
to give a dollar to the clerk when Otto
Smith, who happened to be in the store at
the time, recognized ih him the customer
of the night before and warned the clerk
to beware of him. Accordingly the dollar
was "rung" by the clerk and was prompt
ly found to be false. Smith Immediately
taxed the man with passing bad money
the preceding night. The man seemed
confused, and although the jingle of sil
ver was heard in his pockets he told the
two clerks to wait and after a short time
reappeared with a ten-dollar gold piece.
Martin's clerk changed it and the man
paid Smith a dollar out of the change.
That evening the rumor got about that
Guard Machado was the man who had.
tendered the counterfeits, but later devel
opments point to his double, Reeves, as
the man.
Reeves is a heavily built man of about
45. His face is remarkable for its heavy
eyebrows, in which he resembles tho
guard. His extraordinary likeness to
Machado was a matter of comment at the
prison, and the officials there are all con
vinced he Is tho man. The explanation
tendered by him of the way he came to
get the money shows he was familiar with
the prison. When Otto Smith charged
him with passing the bad money he said
he was a guard and professed to have
borrowed the money of one of his col
leagues.
WHY THE SHIPPING
BILL SHOULD PASS
Senate Committee Hears
Arguments.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â The Senate
Committee on Commerce to-day began
hearings on Senator Frye's bill to pro
mote the commerce and increase the for
eign trado of the United States and to
provide auxiliary cruisers, transports and
seamen for Government uhe when neces
sary â the measure popularly known as the
subsidy bill.
Senator Frye, chairman of the Com
merce Committee, presided and made a
general statement of the efforts which
have been made during the past few years
to advance the interests of the American
merchant marine.
Former Senator G. E. Edmunds, attor
ney or the committee of those interested
in the shipping interests of the country,
made an explanation of the pending bill.
Edmunds said one of the objects of the
measure was to place vessels of American
register upon an equal footing with for
eign-built vessels in the trade with Cuba.
Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines.
The compensation to be paid American
vessels amounted to no more, as Ameri
cans never asked for anything more than
fair play. In referring to the Philippines,
he said that, as an antl-expanslonist, he
was bound to recognize the facts as they
existed. The United States had expanded
and it was necessary to regulate our busi
ness affairs accordingly.
Another object was to provide for fast
vessels of large capacity, not only that
they should be able to carry great car
goes to ports of destination quickly, but
that they should be capable of being
changed quickly into defenders of the
country and its interests. This, too, as an
anti-expansionist, he recognized as neces
sary for the protection not only of our
commerce, but. also of our dominions, and
he would not hesitate, he said, to put
$20,000,000 or $25,000,000 into a plan to ac
complish the end 3 the bill had in view.
A long discussion was precipitated by
an inquiry of Senator Martin as to why
it was provided by the bill that SO per cent
of a ship applying for register and the
subsidy should be owned by Americans.
Edmunds regarded the provision as neces
sary to insure practical American owner
ship and control.
Cnalrman Frye said it was the principle
of the bill to bring under the United
States flag American-owned ships, manned
by Americans, which had been compelled
by tinanclal considerations to sail under a
foreign flag. The vessels under the Amer
ican flag would be able to successfully
compete with foreign ships only because
of tile subsidy provided for In the pending
Louis Nixon, a ship builder of Eliza
bethport, N. J., said that American ship
owners had a monopoly of the coastwise
trade, but the pending bill had little to do
with that. It was the trade on the ocean
with foreign ports which it was proposed
to get. The cost of vessels and their oper
ation under the American flag were much
greater than they were in Europe. They
could be built here as cheaply as any na
tion could build them. There were reasons
for thi3 which did not apply to merchant
vessels.
Nixon said that If he were given abso
lutely free materials and free laborâ the
contract law being repealedâ he would be
able to compete successfully with foreign
ship builders; but he hoped this would not
be done.
Nixon thought it particularly desirable
to encourage and build up the American
tramp steamersâ those vessels which are
so essential to the building up of the car
rying trade of the nation.
W. D. Munson of New York, president
of the Munson Steamship line, believed
that if the bill passed the American ship
builders would rise to the occasion and
soon establish a great merchant marine.
He declared it would be impossible for his
company to use American vessels under
present conditions.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad. Jan. 12.â 1t
is announced here upon apparently good
authority that notwithstanding the offi

active.
It is declared that two days after the
Government had announced the revolu

says the rebels took many prisoners and
captured 562 Mauser rilles, sixty-eleht
cases of cartridges, many flags, seven
cannon and three Maxims, while the Gov
ernment loss in killed was heavy.
Reports yesterday from the east coast
of Venezuela say that the revolutionists
under Generals Antonio Neci and Jose
Diaz have successfully attacked the Gov
ernment forces, which retired. Seven of
the Government troops were killed and
ten were wounded.
Among those killed was Domingo Ned
brother of the revolutionary leader. *

AS HE LEFT PRISON
Must Return vto China Without the
Highly Prized Pig-
Tail.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN QUENTTN PRISON. Jan. 12.â A
new idiosyncrasy of the Oriental charac
ter revealed Itself here to-day when Ah
Hong, who was leaving the prison after
serving a fourth term of ninety days for
grand larceny, flung himself weeping on
the neck of the United States Marshal and
blubbered out in mingled Chinese and
English his grief at leaving and gratitude
for several little kindnesses shown him
by his guards. 4 . . t
Ah Hong has four times seen the Inte
rior of San Quentln, and the thought that
he would never again gaze on its gray
walls or watch the busy workers in verti
cal stripes raising vegetables and weav
ing sacks while a uniformed guard paced
close by proved too much for his Oriental
feelings and he wept.
Ah Hong is to be deported, and nere, say
the flinty hearted prison authorities, lies
the cause of his grief. Ah Hong has no
queue. Like little 80-Peep's muttons, he
will re-enter the Flowery Kingdom minus
his caudal appendage. What fate will be
fall him on his return without the yard of
silk and hair is veiled In mystery. He

WITTHAUS POSITIVE
BARNET WAS POISONED
Very Little Evidence of Importance
Given at the Molineux
Trial.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â The proceedings
to-day In the trial of Roland B. Mollneux
for the murder of Mrs. Katherlne J. Ad
ams were comparatively uninteresting.
Harry S. Cornish and Mrs. Florence E.
Rogers were recalled for the purpose of
identifying the glass from which Mrs.
Adams drank the poisoned bromo-seltzer
and for the purpose of testifying in detail
regarding the incidents which caused the
death of the victim. Herman J. Witte, a
Cincinnati lawyer and a former assistant
to the Chief of Detectives In the Ohio me
tropolis, was called to Identify a letter
which he obtained from the Vannohl Com
pany in Cincinnati. The letter is what Is
known as a bogus Cornish letter and con
tained a request for a "five-day trial rem
edy."
The witness also identified other bogus
letters obtained from the VannohL Com
pany, also for the "five-day trial remedy,"
and signed "H. C. Barnet." r â
Professor Witthaus again made his ap
pearance on the witness stand and testi
fied In great detail concerning the amount
of poison which he found In the body of
Mrs. Adams. Being asked the cause of
the death of Mr 3. Adams, he replied, "Poi
sonâhydrocyanic poison."
Professor Witthaus in conclusion said
that the cause of Barnet's death was poi
son, In tho absence of violence, and when
asked if he would place his Judgment
against the Judgment of the attending
phvslcian If the latter testified that the
palient died of diphtheria, replied in the
affirmative.

and is living the life of a wild man in th*Â»
mountains. It was last Friday that Con
Bledebach and another Pasadenan travel
ing in the mountains saw a man about 30
years of age. with a sandy complexion
hnd wearing a cap, roaming about a lone
ly canyon near Swltzer's Camp, a sum
mer resort now deserted for the season.
Bledebach says the man stared at them
like a maniac, and when they approached
him ran away. They found where he had
stamped a small area In the grass and
had laid down rags to sleep on. Strewn
about the place were bits of orange peel
and seeds of dried prunes, suggesting
what the wild man had been trying to
subsist on. ' When officers went In search
of the man they found the signs of his
having been In the place, but could not
locate him. Mrs. Halla, the wife, says
that Bledebach's description of the nnm
he saw tallies very well with that of her
husband. Though the Hallas had b^en
very comfortable, since the disappsar

and four young children are destitute. Thp
oldest girl. Minna, is 6 years, Aur'ist is 4.
Henry 1^ years and Ralph a 2-months-olil

The family cannot speak much English
and has been temporarily residing with
Mrs. Charles Perry, who Is also German.
Mrs. Perry says they must leave her, as
she does not feel she should support them,
and Is afraid that the wild man may re
turn from the mountains at any time and
murder them all.

MALIETOA TANU
TO THE POWERS
Denounces the Partition
LONDON, Jan. 12.â Malietoa Tanu. In a
letter to the London Times, published to
day, inclosing copies of the protest he
addressed to the United States. Great
Britain and Germany against the Samoan
treaties, characterizes the partition of Sa
moa as a gross violation of the treaties
and as a crime against the law of na
tions only equal to the dismemberment
of Poland, Denmark and France. He
thinks that if it is for the great powers
to promote wars and annexations to dis
tract the minds of the peoples then The
Hague conference was the greatest farce
of the century.
The writer also asserts that the civil
ization introduced by the great powers in
their annexations in the South Seas, Af
rica and elsewhere is inferior to the prim
itive state of the countries stolen, leading
to war through breach of faith on the
part of the government officials and to
the decimating of the peoples by conta
gious diseases and spirituous liquors. Ho
continues: #
The missionaries who graced our country
with their holy and unholy presences introduced
the same rclicious differences and hatreds
against each other as pertained at the hour in
civilized states. The missionaries live In pala
tial concrete houses, with all the luxuries their
countries can afford, and charge us for Bibles
and prayer books, which, we understand, are
6ent as free offerings.
Malietoa Tanu further charges the mls T
sionarles with extracting all the money
possible from them, in return for which
they received only a Bible, a prayer book
or a "Pilgrim's Progress." He charges
the Wesleyan missionaries with having
collected Â£27,000 at a single meeting at
Tonga, adding:
The missionaries aroused a great spirit of em
ulation, telling the natives that the largest giv
ers would bo the most acceptable In the sight
of God, thus reversing the eplrlt of the "wid
ow's mite."
The Samoan chief concludes:
"These be thy gods, O Israel."

HAVANA OFFICIAL
OUSTED BY WOOD
Supreme Court Fiscal in
Disgrace.
HAVANA. Jan. 12.â "Federlco Mora,
Fiscal of the Supreme Court. 13 hereby
removed from office for the good of the
public service. This removal 13 the re
sult of an investigation into the condi
tions existing in the administration of
justice under his supervision."
The foregoing official order was handed
to Senor Mora this morning by Governor
General Wood. Senor Mora's fall has
been predicted ever since the first case
was brought against the customs officials,
and the disgraceful condition of the
prisons, especially as affecting those
awaiting trial, has been generally charged
against him. For some time it has been
said that Mora ha 3 been devoting too
much attention to social affairs and too
little to his duties. General Wood's in
vestigation has shown that the office of
the Supreme Court Fiscal is largely re
sponsible for a number of the untried
cases, and that not only Mora but others
In the Department of Justice have been
persistently trying to block the charges
against customs officials whom Collector
Bliss is anxious to prove guilty of whole
sale bribery and corruption.
Every possible influence has been exert
ed to protect the Incriminated men Irom
the punishment which is their due. But
the public has scarcely been willing to
believe that high officials of the rank of
Mora have been implicated.
Senor Andrade and Senor Pierra are
prominently mentioned as possible suc
cessors in the fiscalship. General Wood
is particularly desirous of securing the
services of an able and honest lawyer, an
Indefatigable worker and a man whose
loyalty to the Cuban cause Is unquestion
able Senor Andrade has a strong politi
cal backing, but by many he is consid
ered too vigorously anti-American, benor
Pierra was formerly the editor ot the In
dependencla. His loyalty to the Cuban
cause Is unquestioned, and, as he lived
many years in the United States, he is
friendly to the Americans. Either ap
pointment probably would be popular
with the people.

decorations. A center piece of pink roses
was placed on each of the supper ta

The cotillon was danced after supper.
Several couples participated, led by
Worthington Whitehouse and Miss
Crocker. The favors represented a num

SCHWARTZ NOT
THE DEFAULTER
Rosenbaum's Ex-Book
keeper Exonerated.
Special Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON, Jan. -12.â There Is a myste
rious shortage in the accounts of D. S.
Rosenbaum & Son. A sensational rumor
was started to-day Involving the name
of Edward D. Schwartz, until recently the
bookkeeper for Rosenbaum & Son, but
there was more sensation than fact in it,
as shown from an interview with Mr.
Rosenbaum himself. Mr. Schwartz is well
connected, is a popular young man and
has been the trusted office employe of the
company for nine years, during all of
which period he enjoyed the esteem anl
confidence of his employers and handled
the firm's financial acounts to their sat
isfaction.
Schwartz Is no longer In the firm's em
ploy, having been discharged recently for
an altogether different cause, and It Is
supposed the rumor started from that
fact.
"I discharged him because he was ir
regular," said Mr. Rosenbaum to-day.
"Sometimes he would not show up for
work, and as he continued in his irregu
larity after being spoken to a number cf
times, he was dismissed from his position.
We have no proof Implicating Air.
Schwartz, and don't intend to have the
books experted. Mr. Schwartz denies em
phatically any knowledge of the shortage,
and we do not know exactly how much
money has disappeared. As far as I have
looked into the matter there is a shortage
of $2300 but 1 guess there is between $3000
and $40u0 all told." â¢
Speaking of Mr. Schwartz's irregularity
In showing- up for work. Mr. Rosenbaum
stated that since the bookkeeper's retire
ment he had heard that Schwartz was in
the habit of keeping fast company, the
company being of the feminine sort.
BUCKLES ROASTS
DEBTORS LAW
Releases Defendant on
a Technicality.
SUISUX, Jan. 12.â John Steiner of Val
lejo recently sued John Plageman to re
cover $424 due him in accordance with a
decision In the Justices' Court of Val
lejo. Plaintiff alleged that he was un
able to obtain the same by reason of the
defendant's fraudulent acts. Plageman
was arrested and released on a writ of
habeas corpus. Steiner then filed an affi
davit on second application for the arrest
of Plageman. Defendant's attorney made
a motion to set aside the order for the
arrest on the following grounds:
First â Want of jurisuiction, because a
second arrest cannot be made of a de
fendant in a civil action before a judg
ment.
Secondâ Want of jurisdiction, because
the name of John Plageman is not set
out in the body of the aifldavit for order
of arrest.
Thirdâ Want of jurisdiction, because
where an affidavit for an arrest in a
civil action is made on information and
belief it must state the facts on which
the information is founded and the reason
for not producing the affidavits of the In
formants.
Judge Buckles has rendered a decision
discharging defendant from custody In
which he says:
"The arrest of a defendant In a civil
action, although authorized by the laws
of this State, is but the scabby, miser
able, lecherous lineal descendant of that
villainous law of barbarous times which
allowed a man to be imprisoned for debt.
In my opinion every step required by the
statute to be taken in order to land tho
defendant in jail must be strictly followed
and no single requirement of the statute
omitted.
"So far as I am able to learn from the
authorities cited this question has only
been before our Supreme Court oneÂ«, and
that the very early case of McCilvey vs.
Moorhead, 2 Cal. eO7. The court there
said: 'When a party is once arrested and
discharged he cannot be arrested again
in the same action. It Is always pre
sumed that the plaintiff In his affidavit
for arrest has stated his case as fully
as ho can to effect his object.' Counsel
for plaintiff maintains, however, that
from the wording of section 481, Code of
Civil Procedure, the order of arrest may
be made as many times as a proper show
ing Is made to the court. The section
reads: 'The order may be made whenever
it appears to the Judge,' etc., but the all
sufficient answer to this is that when the
case of McCilvey vs. Moorhead was de
cided the statute, as far as the point in
volved is concerned, read exactly as it
does now. Of course the order of arrest
could not be made until the affidavit was
first made, and under the ruling In the
case cited the word whenever as used in
the said section simply means that the
order of arrest cannot be made until there
Is an affidavit of arrest."

Mrs. Kelly Alleges That the Teacher
Refused Her Daughter a Diploma

Grounds.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 12.â The board of trus
tees of the State Normal School met in
regular quarterly session herÂ«
to-day. There were present Trus
tees H. C. Brown (chairman). G.
\\\ Pif-rce, George A. Sweigert and V.
\V. Leavitt. State Superintendent Kirk.
Principal McNaughton and Miss Elizabeth
Blaisdel. secretary.
The features of the meeting werÂ»
charges of prejudice made against MrÂ«.
C. L. Place of the training school by Mrs.
SI. P. Kelly, and the adoption of a resolu
tion which givts the faculty power to
Increase the standard demanded of stu
dents for admission.
Miss Maud Mariner, president of the
Ftudem body, ctked that the basket-ball
court be enlarged. This was refened to
the executive committee.
Trustee Pierce stated that George
Schultzberg, a student, asked that he be
granted a room in which a co-operative
book exchange could be carried on. This
was granted and the details left with the
president.
Principal McNaujrhtcn read his remi
annual report. It showed the enrollment
of the Normal School on December 22,
IS>9. to be 702. and that of the training
department Z5. It stated the discipline
of the school was thorough and whole-
Foine, and that as a whole the spirit cf
the student body in regard to decorum
and order was highly satisfactory. Pro
ff-ssor McNaughton suggested that more
time ehould be given to professional work
than arademii ftudies. Crowding of pro
fessional work was a necessity to accom
plish the academic course. This condition
cnuld be remedied by raising the require
ments for admission to the first year
class. The classes of the training school
have been too small to allow student
teachers opportunity to properly cultivate
their power and skill or to give adequate
test of pedagogical ability. There should
be double the number of pupils In the
training school. Over 100 teachers are
graduated at the Normal each year.
Dr. McNaughton suggested that the at
tendance of the training school can be In
creased by giving pupils better opportun
ities than are afforded by the public
pchools and making advantages known to
tht people. The corps of teachers o' thÂ«
training school can be Increased by mak
ing arrangements with the Board of Trus
tees of the public Rchools of the city
whereby the training school becomes a
part of the city school system for the
purpose and enumeration and distribution
of the public school fund and for articu
lation with the high school and a part
of the normal school for the purpose of
supervision and arrangement of curricu
lum. The rest of the report referred to
the school and â¢vras of little importance.
All the trustees favored the raising of
the standard of admission. Superintendent
Kirk said there were 3000 more teachers
than positions now.
Professor Benjamin Ide 'Wheeler was
introduced at the afternoon session and
spoke in regard to the place of the nor
mal school in educational affairs. Ha <lid
not thlr.k normal schools should attempt
the work of high schools, but should be
distinct professional schools. There is no
doubt of a superfluity of teachers and
when there 2s the standard of admission
should be raised. His greatest surprise
In. .California was me hign standing of
the hipn schools, which is brought about
br the accrediting system of the State
University. The work of the normal
school should be between the high school
and university. It will be only a short
time when a nigh school graduation will
he necessary for admission to the normal.
The normal should graduate teachers for
all grades below the high school. The
pedagogical department of the university
is for hljrh school work. He favored a
system by which normal graduates who
Â¦were also high school graduates wishing
to take a university course could receive
some credit at the university for work
done 5n the normal.
State Superintendent Kirk Introduced
the following resolution, which was unan
imously adopted:
Rf-Fol\-M. Thnt !t !s the *Â»r.se of this Board
cf Normal School Trurtees that hÂ»r*after pupils
to b* admitted to th* prof^sional course In

flon at the ecr'.l^^t pcr^ible date.
Mrs. M T\ TveTlv nf finiMiM t>io<n *A-
dressed the board. She stated that her
daughter. Lizzie Kelly, had attended the
Normal School for six and a half years
and had been kept from graduating by a
prejudice of Mrs. C. L. Place, the prin
cipal of the training department. She had
called on Chairman Brown of the Board
of Trustees and asked that justice be
given her daughter, but that official had
treated her coldly and given her no satis
faction. The same coldness had been ex
perienced from members of the faculty.
Finally In desperation she wrote to Gov
ernor Gage and he had referred the mat
ter to Superintendent Kirk. Mrs. Kelly
stated Mrs. Place took a great dislike to
her daughter because M!ss Felker. an
other teacher, had interested herself in
Miss Kelly. She declared a conspiracy ex
isted between Mrs. Place and Miss Dan
iels, a teacher, to keep her daughter from
graduation. Mrs. Kelly's sharpness was
shown when she told how Mips Daniels
had conditioned her daughter at one ex
j amiration on a paper and at a later cx
i amination the same paper was rung in
i and Miss Daniels had marked it "much
better." She said Miss Balis, a teacher in
East San Jose, where her daughter taught
a few weeks, said Miss Kelly was a good
teacher. She intended to see that her
daughter got a diploma.
The board refused to take any cogni
zance of the matter until the charges had
been put in writing.
Mrs. Kelly admitted she had consulted
a lawyer and most likely she will take the
matter to the courts. The case is similar
to that of Henry Miller, now in the courts,
who was also refused graduation by Mrs.
Place. Both these students had com
pleted all their other work but that In
the training department. They character
ize Mrs. Place as a sort of a czarina,
whose every whim must be obeyed.
The absence of Miss Elizabeth McKin
non. who has been preceptress of the Nor
mal for many years, was brought up.
She has been away on account of sick
ness for about four months, her place be
ing filled by Miss Mary George. She has
not written to the trustees in regard to
her absence and they considered this a
Flight. She is now in Pasadena. A lele
pram was ordt-red sent her informing her
that "the welfare of the Normal demand
ed her resignation." It Is said that if
Miss McKinnon returns at once she may
be allowed to resume her position.

HOTEL AT SANTA MARIA
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Conflagration Which Threatened to
Wipe Out the Entire Business
Portion of the Town.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. Jan. 12.â Santa
Maria was visited by the most disastrous
fire in years early this morning. The fire
started In the kitchen of the Santa Maria
Hotel, supposedly from the range. It
broke into a fury shortly after midnight
and spread rapidly to all parts of the
building. The guests and employes were
aroused in time to escape, but many lost
personal effects.
The fire then spread to the brick store
adjoining, owned and occupied by Ilas
low & Co.. dealers in general merchandise.
The store and warehouse at the rear were
badiy damaged. A vacant building on the
opposite side was also burned. The
losses aggregate $12,000 or $15,000, partly
covered by insurance.
The Santa Maria Hotel was not the
leading hotel of the town, but was an old
structure, a two-story frame building,
fronting about lifty feet on Main street.
It was owned by J. R. McCarley. The
citizens turned out and fought the fire
with chemical engines. It threatened to
wipe out the entire business portion of
the town and it was after daylight before
it was fully under control.

sand people saw Paddy Purtell and "Par

to-night at Gavin's athletic arena. It
was a battle for the middleweight cham

Bean was so shifty that Paddy could not
do him any serious damage. Bean broke

APOLOGY OF
TANFORAN
ACCEPTED
The President of the California
Jockey Club Acknowledges
the Written Note.
The disgraceful Incident at Tanforan in
which Edward Corrigan disgraced his as-
Eociat&s by his unseemly behavior ap
pears to be closed, at least for the present.
The letter of apology voted by the stew
ards of the Western Turf Association
was mailed with becoming haste to the
president cf the California Jockey Club,
Thomas H. Williams Jr., and was re
ceived by him yesterday. Mr. Williams
at once acknowledged the receipt of tho
written apology in the following note:
OAKLAND, Jan. 12, ISOO.
P. H. Green. Secretary and Manager
Western Turf Associationâ Dear Sir:
Yours of e\-en date received. The
apology of the Western Turf Associa
tion for the disgraceful scene created
by Edward Corrigan at your track
last Saturday afternoon Is accepted
by the California Jockey Club In the
fame kindly spirit in which I know
It was sent. Yours very respectfully.
THOMAS H. WILLIAMS JR..
President
This exchange of courtesies, which
carry no doubt as deep a sincerity as they
Indicate, having passed, there appears to
be nothing left to the Incident. The offi
cers and members of both associations
will probably continue that courteous in
tercourse which was so rudely Interrupted
by the characteristic outburst of Mr.
Corrlgan- There is a suspicion, however,
that Mr. Corrigan. having admitted him
self the uncouth and therefore Irrespon
sible, may provoke another clash by a
repetition of that demeanor which proved
so very disagreeable to Mr. Mllroy.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 12.â "Kid" McCoy
get tbe decision over Joe Choynskl in a
bout which lasted three rounds at the
Broadway Athletic Club to-night. Cboyn
ski would have had the fight in the sec
ond round were it not for an accident as
to timekeeping. He had floored the Kid
four times, but the timekeeper pulled the
bell as McCoy was counted for the limit
cf ten seconds and this saved the Kid
from absolute defeat. Choynskl's seconds
protested vigorously, but Referee Johnny
White, while knowing that the round was
short by many eeeorids, stood by the of
ficial timekeeper and ordered the men to
continue when the gong rang again for
the opening of the third round. Choyn
eki's cleverness outpointed and outsbad
owed all of McCoy's clever ring work.
McCoy having escaped defeat In the
second round was again lucky in the third.
as the blow with which he sent Choynski
down and out was delivered almost two
seconds after the bell had rung for the
completion of the third round. There was
a great deal of noise in the building at the
t!me the gong sounded and undoubtedly
neither man heard the clang of the bell.
In the northeastern portion of the build
ing there was a tumult caused by one of
the spectators dropping dead. The man
was much excited during the bout and
expressed himself freely as to McCoy be
ing out before the bell rang. He 6lld from
his Peat dead as the bell sounded for the
beginning of the third round.
Colonel Mike Padden, timekeeper for
McCoy, said afterward that the round
was clipped by forty seconds and that Mc-
Coy was groggy and practically out when
the gong rang.
Choynski, while feeling rather cha
grined, eaid that he had no fault to nnd
with the referee, ar.d in a conversation,
with the latter exonerated White from
all blame.
"I had him licked good and sure," said
Choynski, "and had the timekeeper acted
right I had McCoy out. However, I am
satisfied that nothing was done by either
the referee or official timekeeper with an
intention of doing me a wrong. It was an
unfortunate thing that the time should
have been miscalculated, as I bad won
ar.4 won cleverly."
After the bout Choynski and McCoy
elgned articles to meet again under the
same conditions, the bout to take place
at the Broadway Athletic Club on Feb
ruary 20.
Following is a technical account of the
fight by tounds;
First roundâ McCcy was first to land with a
left hook on the Jaw. Joe broke away and Mc-
Coy forced him to his corner, where Choynski
slipped to the floor. The Californian Jumped
up quickly and placed a left swing en McCoy's
iaw, but the Kid sent back a couple of hard
lefts en the face and a etlff right over the
heart. McCoy had all the better of the round.
Second round â Choynsk! sent the Kid to the
floor with a rljrht en the Jaw. McCoy took
nine seconds of the count and when he got up
("hoynskl gt-nt Mm down again with a left on
thÂ« neck. Twice more McCoy was floored and

FALLS DEAD AT
THE RINGSIDE
NEW TORK, Jan. 12.â The spec
tator who fell dead during the llc-
Coy-Choynski fight to-night is be
lieved to have been Byron S. Sabin
of this city. He appeared to the
spectators who sat near him to be
very highly excited over the fight
and at the end of the second round
expressed the opinion that McCoy
had been counted out by the ref
eree. The man next to whom Sabln
sat noticed that at the sound
of the gong for the third round
Sabin leaned heavily against him,
and at the conclusion of the fight,
when he arose to leave the building,
Sabin fell to the floor.
he wer.t to his corner bleeding badly from the
nose and memth.
Third roundâ McCoy fought like a crazy man
when he rushed out of his corner and Joe was
equally erratic. They set all ring rules at de
f:a.nc-Â». but McCoy got the better of the West
Â«-rn man at close quarters. Choynski rushed
McCoy, but the Kid was too spry on hiÂ» feet
and Joe slici*""! to the floor In a vain attempt
to land a ewlng. When Joe got up he ran into
a clinch, from which the referee had to separ
ate the men. Then Choynpki landed a right
Ewing on the Jaw and McCoy went down, tak
ing nearly seven eeconds of the count. When
McCoy got up Choynski rushed at him. but his
lesrs gave way and hÂ» fell to the floor, regain
ing his feet in an instant. McCoy was queer
In his leg movement hut went in and mixed
It up. In a hot rally McCoy hooked his right
to the Jaw, Choynski landing his left at the
Fame moment, ard both men went down. Juet
as tljpy got up the men* rushed at earh other
and the bell rang while they were mixing
things up in a lively fashion. Neither man,
evidently, heard the gong, and McCoy whipped
his right over the jaw and Choynski fell.
There were wild cries of "Foul, foul" as
Choynrkl was carried to his corner and the
Californian was unable to rerpond when the
bell cÂ»J!ed him far the fourth. Choynskl's
seconds threw up the sponge E s McCoy rushed
from his corner for the opening of th? fourth
round, and McCoy waus declared the winner.
McCoy was a positive favorite in the
betting. A few wagers were made at odds
of 100 to 30, but there were many offers at
100 to 25. Even money that Choynskl
would not last ten rounds was plentiful.
McCoy's backers made a number of bets
at 100 to 90 that McCoy would knock his
man out ins=ide of ten rounds.
Danny Duane and George Jansen, both
of this city, met in the preliminary and
Duane stopped Jansen in less than two
minutes in the first round. Duane was
then pitted against Jim McKeever for a
six-round go at catchweights. This bout
resulted In a draw.
EXTRA-SESSION topics were freely
discussed In Governor Gage'a rooms
at the Palace Hotel last Thursday.
All reports of the meeting agree
that the Senatorial vacancy wad
not introduced, but arguments pertaining
to proposed water front legislation were
presented with considerable force.
Intimate friends of the Governor assert
that he did not invite the leading signers
of the extra-session petition to meet him.
It is further asserted that H. P. Sonntag
of the North End Improvement Club took
it upon himself to bring the petitioners
to the Governor's apartments. Sonntag
fancied that the Governor would be im
pressed favorably if the petitioners In
person presented their views to the chief
magistrate. When Gage saw so many
uninvited citizens present he could hardly
conceal his impatience. He made the re
mark several times that he had received
the petition and was greatly impressed by
the statements it contained and would, as
he had promised In his letter to Mr. Sonn
tag, give the Question full consideratlon.
As the general conversation progressed
Gage regained his composure, and sought
by Inquiries jrddressed generally to elicit
information regarding water front facili
ties.
Before the conference dissolved the Gov
ernor spoke in a confidential strain. A
well-known citizen who attended the con
ference asserts that the Governor stated
that an extra session would be called, but
did not Indicate when the proclamation
would be issued, and neither did he utter
the name of a Senatorial candidate nor In
the slightest manner refer to the Sena
torial vacancy. He simply spoke of the
necessity of an extra session to legislate
on water front measures and said that the
statement which he had just listened to
convinced him that an extra session was
demanded In order to provide San Fran
cisco harbor Improvements. He cautioned
his hearers against leaving in a body. He
mentioned the activity of the dally news
papers- and Intimated that remarks had
furlong was only a canter for Oorngan s

Track Notes.
Conley was given thirty dajw on the
ground for rough riding in the two-year
old race. He had the mount on Sig Levy
and did nothing but bump into Rathgar
the last eighth of a mile.
There is considerable complaint among
owners at not being able to start at Tan
foran, while race after race is put on for
Corrigan's horses.
Jockey Mattler, who was so badly In
jured In Wednesday's hurdle etvent, was
on Thursday removed to St. Luke's Hos
pital. It is feared the young rider is suf
fering from concussion of the brain, and
his recovery is doubtful.

GIFT TO MRS. TOWNSEND.
Members of the First California Vol
unteers Remember Their
Benefactress.
Colonel Victor D. Duboce, on behalf of
the First California Volunteer Regiment,
presented Mrs. A. S. Townsend yesterday
with a handsome souvenir.
The members of the regiment have long
desired to show their appreciation of the
many favors and acts of kindness be
stowed by Mrs. Townsend, and finally de
cided to present their benefactress with a
book containing their photographs as a
token of their esteem. The book em
bodies a unique idea and in design is a
novel piece of workmanship.
To say that the gift is highly appreci
ated conveys but a faint idea of the feel
ings of the recipient.
Mrs. Townsend through The Call desires
to thank- each and every member of the
regiment for their kind remembrance, and
acknowledges the gift, coming as it did
from the soldier boys, as more acceptable
than anything money could buy.

follows: "At the request of Mr. Charles

to prepare and forward to the Tea Ex

INVITED TO BE OUR GUEST
HAD PI^ANNED TO TVTATCE THIS
STATE HIS HOME.
gpeclal Dispatch to The Call
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON" HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â
Members of the California delegation
called upon Admiral Dewey at his home
in this city by appointment at 10 o'clock
this morning to present an Invitation ex
tended by the Natire Sons to the hero of
Manila Bay, to be the guest of the people
of California on the 9th of September
next. Representative Kahn in a few words
expressed the admiration of the people of
California for the admiral and said that
while it would give them pleasure to ex
tend California's hospitality to him at any
time, the celebration of the fiftieth anni
versary of the admission of California
into the Union would be an occasion emi
nently fit to show him how deep an affec
tion the people of the Golden- State have
for him.
Senator Perkins followed and assured
the admiral that California's greeting to
him would be most hearty, that the peo
ple of San Francisco breathed a sigh of
relief when they learned that he had so
completely vanquished the Spanish fleet
on tnat memorable first day of May, and
thereby saved San Francisco from the
danger of bombardment from its guns.
He referred to the fact that Admiral
Dewey's fiagship Olympla was built in San
Francisco, and that the inhabitants of
that city would esteem it an unprece
dented honor to entertain the hero who
had so proudly sailed her to victory.
Admiral Dewey replied In a few well
chosen sentences. He said that he intend
ed to visit California at some time in the
near future and that he would try to ar
range his engagements so as to be able
to be there during the golden celebration
of her admission, but that he could not
make any positive promises at the pres
ent time. He spoke of his great love for
the State and said that if the events of the
Spanish war had not in a measure
changed the current of his life, he would
have made his home at Santa Barbara.
Referring to the fact that the Olympla,
his flagship, was the product of the skill
of California's mechanics, and that the
Oregon and the Monterey, which had also
Joined his fleet before he left Manila, were
also built in California, he stated that he
would be proud to meet the mechanics and
artisans who had turned out such magnifi
cent warships. He said that the presence
of the Monterey was partly responsible
for the capitulation of Manila without the
firing of a single gun from the fleet. Some
ot the more hot-beaded of the Spanish
commanders were determined upon firing
on the American ships, but the cooler
headed commanders said that It would be
useless, because a nation that would send
such a vessel as the Monterey across the
Pacific Ocean was capable of doing: any
thing. There was a hearty laugh at this
remark, and after an informal conversa
tion and a hearty handshake the delega
tion withdrew. Admiral Dewey promised
to write a formal letter to Representative
Kahn in acknowledgment of the beautiful
Invitation forwarded from San Francisco.

THE CALL'S RACING CHART.
(Copyright, 1900. by H. H. Egbert.)
TANTOBJLN PARK, Friday, January 12, 19OO.â Thirty-sixth day
of the Winter Meeting of the Western Turf Association. Weather fine.
Track fast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEW TORK. Jan. 12.â McCoy to-night gave the following signed statement
to The Call:
I don't know anything about the timekeeper's watch showing that I had
been down twelve seconds, but I do know that I was on.rfly feet when the
referee counted nine seconds.
I purposely waited to hear the referee count nine before I got on my
feet. If I had been declared out on the timekeeper's count it would have been
an Injustice to me. as I was listening to the referee.
About the blow delivered by mo after the bell rang. I want to Bay that I
did cot hear the bell ring. I delivered the blow In good faith, and do not think
I should have been disqualified on that account. I ' think I beat Choynski
fairly. CHARLES (KID) McCOY.
Choynskl made the following statement:
"I was the victim of the most unjust ruling ever rendered against a boxer
In competition. I beat McCoy fairly and squarely and should have been de
clared the winner. According to the statement of the official timekeeper of the
club McCoy was down twelve second? in the second round, and was therefore
out. After knocking McCoy out according to the rules, the Kid later dealt me
a foul blow and prevented m* fighting further. I should then have been named
ts wiener. I was robbed of victory twice. JOE CHOYNSKI."
been ascribed to him which he never utÂ»
tered. He feared that the departure of
the petitioners in a throng would causa
the newspapers to spread the report that
an extra session demonstration had been
held in his rooms. Therefore he wanted
nothing said of the conference or his de
termination to convene the Legislature.
A story apparently authentic comra
from Sacramento that Secretary of Stata
Curry is so positive of the extra session
that he has made arrangements to opeu
the "well" in the basement of the Capitol
building.
Merchants who attended the conference
day before yesterday, together with oth
ers who have had good opportunity to as
certain what took place there, were con
fident last night that the proclamation
would soon be Issued.
A few weeks ago the Governor told an
Associated Press agent that the procla
mation. If one were issued, would be pre
pared In the executive office at Sacra
mento and Issued directly from that de
partment. This remark was doubtless
made to dispel the impression that Herrln
and Dibble were preparing tho proclama
tion In the law office of the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Delay in calMng the members together
Is accounted for by Gage's intimates by
an apprehension on his part that he may
not be able to handle the Legislature In
the matter of adjournment. The member*
are eager to get on the pay roll again,
but are not quite willing to bledge them
selves In writing to come off at the com
mand of the executive. A seeming indif
ference on the part of the Governor ma/
tend to increase the anxiety of the legis
lators and compel them to accept such
conditions as the Governor may dictate.
Gage Is Non-Committal.
L.OS ANGELES, Jan. 12.â Governor
Gage arrived here this morning and la at
the Van Nuys Hotel, lie refused to b<%
interviewed regarding an extra session oC
tho Legislature. It has been stated that
he will call the extra session while In th' 3
city, but leading Republicans here sar
that this Is improbable and that ho will
wait until his return to the capital.
TOPMAST IS
BEATEN OUT
BY OPPONENT
Phelan Rode the Winner
With Excellent Judgment.
Results at Tanforan.
Finishing three heads on the post with
Opponent and Scotch Plaid. Topmast
again* gave his admirers a feeling of en
nui at Tanforan yesterday. Tho chestnut
horso "answered bugle call an 11 to 5
favorite for the mile and a furlong racing
recital, only to be downed a head by Op
ponent; with' Scotch Plaid a "snoot" far
ther away. Little Phelan piloted the win
ner and fairly outrode Jack Martin, much
to the Jatter's astonishment and chagrin.
Einstein, the outsider of the party, set a
withering clip to the stretch, when he be
gan backing up. The timeâ l:s3*4â marked
a new track record.
The card was not an enticing onÂ© and
the result was plainly shown In the at
tendance, which was smaller than usual.
Long shots were not Quite so conspicuous
as during the earlier days of the week,
although Sugden strolled In at 12 to 1.
Favorites attached themselves to four of
the purses.
Corrlgan captured tho two-year-old
purse with Rathgar, a youngster by imp.
Masseto. A7to 6 favorite, he fought it
out through the stretch with Sig Levy.
The last few yards the pair were Joined
by Dunfree, all finishing heads on the
wire, with the Corrigan entry in front.
Sig Levy was third, but the judges set
him back for foul riding on the part of
Conley.
Corrigan's three-year-old St. Casimir
enjoyed a Cakewalk in the six furlong
dash following. He had nothing to beat,
and ruling a 1 to 4 favorite won in rag
time. Mountebank easily took the place
from Diomed.
Sugden, at odds of 12 to 1. took the third
race, a five furlong scramble for "crabs."
Vittitoe'had the mount, and the chestnut
horse won galloping from Espirando, a
12 to 1 shot. Croker, the favorite, ran
unplaced.
Of the" bad assortment of racing timber
starting in the mile selling run Duke of
York enjoyed a slight call over Hohenlohe
and Credo. Thorpe managed to get him
away first, and leading throughout won
by a head in a hard drive from Charles
Le Bel. The show went to Credo.

EFFORTS TO STAMP OUT THE
DREAD DISEASE.
A Report to the Board of Health to
Be Beferred to the School
Board and May Be
Adopted.
OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â "N0 per
son affected with pulmonary
tuberculosis shall be employed or re
tained in the service of the Public
School Department of the city of
Oakland; and no pupil affected with
pulmonary tuberculosis shall be per
mitted to attend any public school
in said city. Any employe in the ser
vice of the Public School Department
or any pupil in attendance upon any
public school of said city suspected
of being affected with pulmonary tu
berculosis shall, within one week
after having been notified by the City
Superintendent ; of Schools, either
withdraw from the service of the
School Department or attendance
upon school or submit to a bacterio
logical examination by the city bac
teriologist, who shall, upon the com
pletion of such examination, file with
the City Superintendent of Schools a
certificate setting forth the result of
such examination. The examination
shall be without cost to the applicant,
and the certificate of the city bac
teriologist shall be the only evidence
required by the Board of Education."
This report was presented to the Board
of Health this evening by a committee
composed of Drs. A. L. Cunningham, J.
B. Wood and J. Maher. It Is the result
of their investigations upon the proposi
tions submitted to the Board of Health
a month ago by Health Officer Todd and
Dr. Maher. The report was not finally
acted upon, though If it came to adop
tion it would be carried, for It is signed
by a majority of tho board.
This rule will be referred to the Board
of Education, and that body will be asked
to make It a part of their rules. Health
Officer Todd says that he has consulted
with the members of. the Board of Edu
cation, and that they are willing and anx
ious to support the Board of Health in
this move, and that this will be adopted
by that body.
If the Oakland Board of Education and
the Board of Health each adopt this rule
Oakland will be the first city In the State
which will place a tuberculosis test over
the teachers and pupils of the schools.
This proposed rule is as sweeping as the
suggestion made by Dr. Maher at the last
meeting, when he proposed a tuberculosis
test for scholars, for it includes the pu
pils as well as the teachers.
This Is onÂ© of the most advanced moves
along the line of consumption tests that
has been made anywhere in the State.

WILL SOON END
Open Season for Quail and
Ducks Will Terminate
Shortly.
The members of the gun clubs which
have preserves in this district are pre
paring for their final shoots of the sea
son. Both ducks and quail will soon be
secure from the shotgun brigade which
has been so persistently after them for
some months past.
Country Club men are making efforts to
have the quail season, which ends on the
15th inst., extended another fortnight.
Owing to adverse weather conditions the
shooting has not been as good as ex
pected. The Marin County hills are still
full of birds, hence the desire for an ex
tension of the season. This has been a
splendid year for the birds, which have
had an opportunity to thrive and multi
ply, and promises well for the sport next
year. The wet weather has kept many
sportmen at home while the moist ground
has sent the birds into the impenetrable
underbrush, where they were safe from
their worst enemies, the trappers.
The 'heavy storm of ten days ago not
only scattered the ducks, but obliterated
all traces of ponds on the various pre
serves. The birds are again gathering in
great numbers on the snores of the Day
down about Mount Eden and good shoot
ing is expected there to-morrow.
The members of the Olympic Gun Club
did not go near their preserves last week,
as all indications pointed to there being
no shooting. The overflow has subsided
in a degree, however, and some of the
members will test the sport to-morrow.
Among those who have already signified
their Intention of being present are L.
Titus. F. F. Titus and M. E. Unger.
None of- the Black Jack Club members
ventured up to Sherman Island last Sun
day. They will probably close the season
to-morrow. Bert Patrick and Bert Wy
man, with Andy Buckley and Billy San
derson as their guests, will form the prin
cipal shooting party. Mr. Sanderson, who
is said to be art expert field shot, is ex
pected to bring down a big string of birds.
Sam Hughes has gone into Idaho and
Dakota to hunt big game. He will meet
a party of gentlemen from the East at
Ogden and will be their guest for some
time. They anticipate fine sport, as game
of all kinds la to be found there in abund
ance.
George Jackson, the well-known sports
man, has gone to Los Banos to enjoy the
great sport with the ducks now seen there.
Friends sent tor him post haste, saying
they were securing 150 birds to the gun
each day.
The best shooting last week was secur
ed along the bay shore. Down at Alvar
ado L. R. Larzalere, John H. Burfeind
and George Wolf made a Joint bag of
seventy ducks.
Al Wilson had a try at black brant In
Tomales Bay some days since, but condi
tions were not favorable for a good *shoot.
He secured a dozen birds. He will have
another day with them shortly. Tomales
Bay is fairly swarming with the birds, but
they are hard to get. They fly high and
It requires a big gun, heavily loaded, to
bring them down.
The friends of George Morse, clerk of
the United States District Court, are
much interested In a shoot he enjoyed last
Sunday on the Sonoma marsh as a guest
of the Alameda Gun Club men. Mr.
Morse tells an interesting story of his
success, but his friends are anxious to
learn where he disposed of the eighty
canvasbacks which he claims to have
killed. According to his own story he
never missed a shot, dropping two and
three birds at a time. None of these
ducks are in evidence, hence the general
demand for an explanation from the man
v/lth a gun.
George Dennis was high gun of the Pas
time Club members at Alvarado last Sun
day, securing sixteen birds. Mr. Maynard
and a friend secured a good Joint bag on
the Willow Lodge grounds.
David Thorn and Clarence Haight will
be in the field after quail at Llvermore
to-morrow.
Al. Cummlng, the all-round sportsman.
Is suffering from a cold, which prevents
his enjoying the closing days of the sea
son.
Frank Maskey. wJio has had a lot of
sport after quail in the Point Reyes
country this season, went up on Tuesday
to spend several days. He wanted to en-
Joy the fine shooting while it lasted. He
will leave for Bakersfleld shortly, where
he will handle his setter, Lady Rodschaff.
In the members* stake.
DOWN near Bakersfield are quartered the finest setters and pointers in the State, all being pre
pared for the annual field trials, which will commence on the 22d inst. The entries are in excels
of those of last year, and some brilliant work is expected when the crack dogs meet. Birds are
becoming plentiful, many having been driven down from mountain fastnesses by recent storms.
The cover is thicker than in previous years, and it is expected the birds will not run, as has been
their habit under other conditions. The illustration shows the master of Stockdale, W. S. Tevis, and
the noted dogs Sam's Bow and Cuba of Kenwood. The former won the all-age stake last year,
with his kennel mate in third place. Merry. Heart, which Is handled by R. M. Dodge, was second in
the Derby last year. Glad Star, which is owned by Judge McKenna. is a prominent factor In the all
age stake competition. Cuba is again interested in the all-age and championship stakes, while Sam's
Bow will be seen In the champion stake. Many sportsmen of note will attend the trials and will han
dle their own dogs in the members' stake, that being one cf the requirements.

ASSOCIATION ATHLETICS.
Basket and Indoor ball are the two fa-
vorlte sports at the Young Men's Chris
tian Association at the present time. On
Tuesday night the Apollos of the Oakland
branch met the Missions of this city In
Oakland and played a closely contested
game, the finally triumphing by
a narrow margin.
The Apollos met the Rushers last night
In the gymnasium of the association In
this city and another close battle was
fought. The schedule of basket ball games
between the two local teams and the
Apollos of Oakland has aroused consider
able Interest In j the game and both
branches of the association are training
hard for future matches.
In regard to Indoor baseball the associa
tion Is In a quandary. The Olympic. Re
liance and Stockton clubs, along with the
Young Men's Christian Association, were
to . form a league early last week, but
there was a miscalculation in time and
nothing" eventuated. The time fixed for
the meeting of the. four clubs to arrange
a winter schedule Is next Tuesday even-
Ing. It seems as If Stockton would with
draw from the prospective league. The
Young Men's Christian Association and
the Reliance Club are waiting for the
Olympic Club to signify a fleslre to' enter
a triplicate league and arrange a schedule.
This will be done next week, the two local
teams and the Reliance forming the
league. Stockton has arranged for a series
of games, with the.winners of tho series.

ing to the by-laws of the association.
SAN MATEO HUNT CLUB.
The place selected for the meet *of thÂ»
San Mateo Hunt Club last Saturday was
the Ten-mile House, beyond Mlllbrae, on
the San Bruno road. The place of ren
dezvous, however, was so far away and
the Intervening road In so bad a condi
tion that few attended. On Wednesday
last the meet took place at the Home
stead. San Mateo, at 3 In the afternoon.
To-day the hounds will hunt the Spring
Valley country, near the Crystal Springs
Lake; and next Wednesday the meet will
be at Burns station, on the farther side

of the hunt will rendezvous at San Car
los station.

The master will be here about the mid
dle of next week and after his return there
will be much activity among the men who
follow the hounds.

victories on the path during the season
easily proclaim it the leading cycling club
on the coast.
W. P. Crary, president of the Twentieth
Century Manufacturing Company of New
York and well known to the trade. Is ex
pected here In a few days, en route to
China and Japan on a pleasure trip

OLYMPIC CLUB BOXING.
The officials of the Olympic Athletic
Club are more than pleased with the out
look for their proposed boxing tournament
between the crack amateurs of the East
and of this coast. J. E. Sullivan, secre
tary of the Amateur Athletic Union, has
taken a personal interest in the affair and
will send only the best men. He has sug
gested that the club defer its tournament
until after the national championships.
These will be held early in February and
the pick of the boxers will then be sent
on here. "This, will do away with the
chance of any men of mediocre ability
coming here. The bouts will be held In
the club's gymnasium and will be free to
members. They will extend over several
days. *
A gentlemen's night will be held next
Thursday, when a varied programme will
be presented by Leader John A. Hammer
smith. A wrestling bout, best two out of
three, will be one of the features. H.

ing 175 pounds, will meet Chris Plersen,
185 pounds, of the Reliance Club. The Rev.
H. W. L-O'Rourke of the Seamen's Insti
tute will have some of the apprentices
from the English ships present. They will
box and will also take part In a tug of
war with the strudy Olympians.

ON THE RANGE
Have Already Prepared for a
Season of Activity at the
Targets.
The Germanla Schuetzon Club and the
Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club hold
their Initial shoots for this year to-mor
row ou the Shell Mound range. The list
of the Germania's events is similar to the
one of last season, which proved so" suc
cessful. The main re-entry match will

and $20, three shot tickets, best ten score 3

The Golden Gates have made a radical
departure in tiie makeup of their list of

Mass., range. In this personal competi
tion is abolished, the marksmen shooting
until they have reached the requisite per
centage in the ten ten-shot scores of tnelr
respective classes. In this system the

WINTER BOOM
ON THE COURTS
California Tennis Club Alive
With Old and New
Players.
Winter tennis Is booming at the Califor
nia Club this month. The members are
out in numbers every afternoon, and even
the ladles are passing up golf for their old
favored net and court sport.
Saturday tournaments are the thing at
the presnt time. Some of them are im
promptu, with the drawings just befo.e
the tourney begins, other prearranged.
To-day a double tournament will be held
on the courts of the Bush and Pierce
street club, which will bring out all the
regulars. A general drawing will take
place, both for the placing of matches
and the selection of teams. There will be
prizes awarded the winners, the exact na
ture of which is not yet determined.
Many of the old players have returned
to . the club, among them being Robert
Ayres. He was formerly a devotee of the
game and earned quite a reputation
among the best the club could produce.
Some of the noteworthy matches of the
week are as follows: Miss Edna Hopkins
and Joseph Daily were defeated by Miss
Georgie Hopkins and Robert Eyre, Iâ6,
6â2, 6â3 and 6â2. In a three-set match
Dr. Root and Ralph Bliven played n tie
match, the score being 6â4,6 â 4, 4â6 and 4â4,
darkness preventing the conclusion of the
third set. Joe Daily defeated B. H. John
son, 6â2 and 6âl. H. W. Crowell won an
easy match from Homer Parker. 6 â i and
4âl. L. Rosenberg took the measure of
Duval Moore In a single-set match by
9-7.
The longest and most hotly contested
match of the week was between Miss Ber
nlce Drown and Miss Elslet Clark. The
score of the first set was 18 â 16, the second
6âl,6 â I, Miss Clark proving the victor in
both.
George Whitney has played regularly cf
late, defeating the best the club could of
fer.
Fr.id that his private business would re
quire all his attention during the present
year. Ex-Commodore W. N. McCarthy
is the favorite candidate and will almost
certainly accept the nomination, though
he has not yet formally done so. For vice
commodore H. R. Simpklns of the yawl
Tramontana is the probable nominee. R.
B. Hogue will receive the nomination for
treasurer, E. C. Bartlett for recording
secretary and W. G. Morrow for financial
secretary. For the offices of port captain
and measurer J. R. Savory of the sloop
Juanita. R; S. Bridgeman of the sloop
Thetis and J. S. Cockerill are likely nom
inees. All three were In the crew of the
Gadder when she won the perpetual chal
lenge cup.
Alter considerable discussion and oppo-.
sit ion on the part of some of the members
the Corinthians have decided to give an
entertainment in this city to raise funda
to enlarge their Tiburon clubhouse. Tho
accommodation has long been inadequate
to receive the many guests who attend
all Corinthian shows. The intention is to
enlarge the clubhouse on the western side,
adding a permanent stage and dressing
rooms for the performers. So many
yachtsmen and others have enjoyed the
club's hospitality that the members feel
sure the entertainment will be largely at
tended by people willing to help the good
work. The entertainment is in charge of
the board of directors and of J. V.
O'Brien, T. T. Williams and F. E. Har
mon. It will be given in Native Sons*
Hall on February 15. The annual, elec
tion of officers will be held on the 31st
inst., when those already nominated will
be formally elected. The Corinthians will
not let the approaching yachting season,
go by without challenging for the per
petual cup. The general opinion is in fa
vor of challenging in the Gadder's class,
as many of the Corinthians believe that
J. W. Pew's Truant, in thorough order
and sailing trim, can beat last year's win
ner. The Truant had a twisted rudder In
the race of September 23, ,1899, and puzzled
her helmsman a good deal by the strange
manner in which she behaved. Of course
the blame for this attaches to those who
prepared her for the race, for, as Sir
Thomas Lipton and the New York yachts
men agreed in saying, a yacht race is a
test not merely of speed but also of con
struction and seaworthiness.
At the annual meeting of the California
Yacht Club the following were elected to
hold office for one year: E. N. Walter,
commodore; H. L. Martin, vice commo
dore; G. L. Wakeman. recording secre
tary; A. .C. Glbbs. treasurer; J. J. Sherry,
port captain; A. M. Clay and L. S. Sher
man, directors; J. Carrier, measurer; R.
L. E&mes, 11. L. Clapp and J. H. Clay,
members of the regatta committee; A.
M. Clay, R. . R. THommedieu and E. N.
Walter, delegates to the Pacific Interclub
Yncht Association. The annual report of
the secretary showed that 1899 opened
with forty-one active and four honorary
members on the list, and that during the
year two members who had been granted
leave of absence were restored and fifty
six new members elected, raising the to
tal to 103. The list has been reduced by
death, resignation and leave of absence,
and now stands at eighty. J. Llghtfoot,
secretary of the .Healani Yacht Club of
Honolulu, while on a visit to San Fran
cisco last year was elected an honorary
member of the Callfornlas. .
Notices have been sent out to the mem
bers of the Oakland Canoe Club that the
annual meeting for the election of offi
cers will be held at the clubhouse on Ses
sions Bay, East Oakland, on Saturday,
the 20th, at 8 o'clock in the evening. The
officers to be chosen are the following:

Alameda Oarsmen Make Ar

Race on Oakland Creek.
The newly elected officers and the mem
bers of the Dolphin Swimming and Boat
ing Club will hold their annual dinner to
night at a downtown restaurant. The of
ficers will be installed, there will be
speeches and an all-round jollification.
Efforts will shortly be made to get to
gether a junior barge crew to represent
the club In the first regatta of the season.
The members of the South End barge
crew that is to race against the Alame.ia
seniors on the 21st Inst. rowed to Hunters
Point and back to the boathouse last Sun
day. They were well satisfied with the
way in which their bout traveled. They
will row their barge over to Oakland
Creek to-morrow and will leave it there
In readiness for the race. If the weather
should prove unfavorable for the row, the
boat will be taken over on the ferry. The
race Is intended to show the public how
well suited Oakland Creek is for such an
event, and it is hoped that arrangements
may be made later for the erection of a
grand stand for spectators and of dress
ing-rooms for oarsmen on the narrow
gauge moie, which has ben filled in and is
now solid ground for its whole length with
the exception of a hundred yards. Oak
land Creek is advantageous for boat-rac
ing for various reasons â an accurate
three-quarters of a mile course can be laid
out by measuring along the railroad
track; spectators can see the start and
finish, or any part of a race, and with the
dressing-rooms and judges' stand, if
erected on the mole, the various events
on the programme could be brought Jff
without tedious waits. The judges will
watch the Alameda-South End race from
a launch, which will start about fifteen
minutes before the barges, as the latter
are considerably faster than a launch. The
race will be started just as the train be
gins to pull away from the mole, so that
persons on board may see the beginning
of the long struggle; by riding on to
Chestnut street and getting off there it
will be possible to reach the Alameda
boathouse In time to see the finish nud

I'unn would be in California In time to
take part in the contest, but his engage
ments in Omaha and Denver render it lm
j>Â»!-sible for him to reach San Francisco
until next week. On the 2Cth inst. Willie

the following fortnight it is proposed to
hold several matches for the profes

Walter Cosby, champion of the Los
Angeles Country Club, who recently won
the Hotel GreÂ«n championship at Pasa
dena, came up to this city Intending to
enter the tournament at Oakland, which
he believed to be an "open" one. He was
disappointed to learn that only profes
sionals are admitted to the contest. W.
Cosby is considered by some to be the
Ftronkest player In California; at any
rale, he. with C. E. Maud of Riverside.
C. E. Orr of Pasadena and John Law
pon of the Burllngame Country Club, form
a class by themselves. Mr. Cosby went
around the Presidio course on Wednes
day.
James Melville of Monterey Is visiting

Of the professionals who will take part
In to-day's tournament Alexander Smith
Is perhaps least kr.own locally, though he
bears a high reputation among golfers
throughout the United States. He was
born at Carnoustle, in Scotland, and. like
most natives of that place, began to swing
c club almost as soon as the could toddle.
He devoted great pains to the rudiments
of the game and in 1835 was among the
scratch players of the Carnoustle and
Taymouth club. In I*? 7 he had to concede
pn allowance evon to the scratch men.
He won the gold cross, the silver ketUe
presented by the Caledonia Club and the
Ptevenson cup. He made the fine score of
79 on the full medal course and later low
ered the record of the Carnoustle links,
Â¦which had stood at 75 for some years to
74. Alec (or "Sandy" > Smith is said to be
a thorough sportsman and a splendid
coach, especially. for beglnmrs. He was
for nine years In the employ of the cele
brated Carnoustie clubmaker. Robert
Simpson, who had the highest opinion of
his skill. He came to the United States
in the spring of 183S ami wan engaged by
the Washington Park Golf Club. Chicago
In 383S he was second to Fred Herd for the
open championship of the United States
en the links of the Myopia Hunt Club
and last year was seventh in the open
championship contest held at Baltimore
Â¦when his brother Will became champion"
It Is said that he has played In more pro
fessional tournaments and has won more
money than any golfer In the United
States. He has been engaged by the Coro
n.ado Golf Club for the winter, but In the
summer will return to the Washington
Park Club. He Is a member of the firm
of Hord. Smith & Yeoman, who manufac
ture some of the best clubs In this coun
try. A fine and interesting exhibition of
polf Is expected when Alec Smith, Willie
Anderson. Horace Rawlins and David
Stephenson meet. The prize money will
Hlmost certainly go to three of the four
Ji.'^t named.
The first open tournament of the Casa
TÂ»ma Golf Club at Redlands recently
played was successful. The men's el*ht
cn-hol<> handicap was won by A. E. Stir
ling- with a score of 192 1, ss 28 â 164; W

STARTS FOR GRACE TROFHT
Will Meet Overture, Temple,
Plough Boy, Luxo; and
Other Crack Dogs.
\ LTHOI'GH it has not been announeeil
A authoritatively It Is generally under
stood that For Freedom, the most
remarkable greyhound that ever
went to .slips in California, will be a con
tender for the John Grace challenge cup
next month at Union Park. The great
representative of Pasha Kennels won this
classic stake last year and J. H. Rosseter.
his owner, is anxious to place another win
to his credit. The coming of Overture,
the Irish dog which beat For Freedom
in their puppyhood days, it is claimed by
a fluke, has much to do with the deter
mination to send him to slips again. For
Freedom started some twelve times since
his coming to this coast and none of the
dogs ho met In the various rounds of
these stakes could extend him. So much
has been said and written about this dog
that an immense attendance is expected
when he makes his reappearance on the
coursing field.
Curtis & Sons of San Jose have nomin
ated eight dogs for the rich stake. Ad
these will probably include Luxor. Cava
lier. Cash, Vanity Fair and Beacon, it 13
evident they will make a big bid for the
stake.
Luxor will perform to-day at Union
Park, as will Judge P. J. Reilly's Plough
Boy, which has been on the retired list
for some time. The open stake attracted,
an entry of eighty-eight dogs, and ac
cording to the draw, some great coursin?
should result. At Inglestde a sixty-four
dog open stake is supplemented by a
puppy stake.
A total 01 $60,543 was disbursed among
the coursing men In prize money at Union
Park last year. The park will have been
in operation two yeara next month. Up
to the present time the total prize money
has been Â»104.285. An equal amount ha.-*
been paiJ In salaries. Eight hundred and
twenty-nine different dogs ran last year
in a total of 6430 coursesâ an average of
I^s a week. Frank Cushlng has compiled
a wonderful table for the park manage
ment. It shows the time or each course
and the distance by which each dog led
to the hare. Referenco to this will quick
ly settle any question as to a dog' 3 re
versal of form.
T. J. Cronln's Rosie B has been mated
with J. Seggersons Candelaria.
Frank Baker, who trains for D. J.
Healey of Petaluma, will leave for Aus
tralia Immediately after the John Graco
cup stake. He expects to return with
a string of good dogs.
J. L. Ross, formerly of Petaluma, has
brought his string of dogs to this city
and will go In strongly for coursing.
M. B. Kavanaugh's Swedish has been
mated with N. P. Whiting's Rochester.
J. O'Shea's Golden Shore has whelped
a litter of puppies to Frank Moran's Falso
Flatterer. Golden Shore is by Rusty Gold
out of Wave, one of the most noted lit
ters, whelped on this coast.
Joseph Mazztnl's Pearl Fullerton has
* helped a litter of six puppies to John
Kerrigan's St. Lawrence. Three of them
are dogs.
J. 11. Rosseter. master of Pasha Ken
nels, has sent instructions from England
that Firm Friend be retired from the*
field and allowed to end his days In peace.
The old dog is one of the truest winning
greyhounds ever seen here, being a splen

5ELECTION FORECASTS.
WITH the opening of each year of a Presidential
election political experts begin to make fore
casts of the probable results of the campaign.
This year is no exception to the rule. Although to
the general public it seems as well assured as any
thing in the future can be that McKinley will be re
nominated and re-elected, there are not lacking
political calculators who believe, or at least profess
to believe, that the result is by no means so certain
a c . it appears.
The New York Post is one of the authorities that
sees danger ahead for the Republican party unless the
leaders in Congress this^winter act with marked dis
cretion in dealing with issues upon which the peo
ple have not yet made up their minds. It points out
that -while McKinley obtained 271 out of 447 votes in
the Electoral College in 1896, and polled over 600.000
more ballots than Bryan, yet it would have taken a
comparatively small change of votes in a few States
to have made Bryan President. The Post says:
In the first place, while McKlnley's victory in IS%
was. in one sense overwhelming:, analysis shows that
the change of less than 34.000 votes In four Southern
and two Northern States would have put his opponent
ln the White House. Bryan secured one of the electors
from Kentucky, and McKinley j obtnined tho other
twelve* by pluralities not exceeding 2SI; the other three
States of the formerly "solid South" which went for
McKinley were carried by 3537 votos In Delaware, I\.-.
457 in West Virginia and 32.2.'J2 in Maryland. Bryan se
cured one of the nine electors from California, and lost
the other eight by pluralities rising no higher than 1922.
Indiana wont for McKinley by a plurality of IS.ISI. In
other Words, if the hesitating voters In these half dozen
States, who made up their minds at the last moment,
had gone the other way to the number of 141 In Ken
tucky. 902 ln California, 1019 In Delaware, 5744 In Wrst
Virginia. 0001 ln Indiana and 16.117 in Maryland. Bryan
would have had 22S electoral votes and tho Presidency!
despite tho fact that even then McKlnley's plurality
over him at the polls would have been much more than
half a million. .
The New York Times, on the other hand, sees no
leason whatever to doubt the result. It claims that
the Middle Western States â Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Illinois. lowa. Michigan, Indiana and Ohio â are sure
for McKinley in case Bryan be nominated. It then
goes on to say: \
Nobody pretends that Bryan has the least chance
to carry any Now England State. The New England
States have together 39 electoral votes. New York, with
25 Votes; Now Jersey, with 10, and Pennsylvania, with
22 votes, can never be carried by W. J. Bryan or any
other candidate Btanding on the Chicago platform.
Thf.se three groups of absolutely sure anti-Bryan
States, therefore, make this showing:
. Electoral
Votes.
New England Â» 39
Lllddle States 7S
Middle Western States 115
Total ...."]..... 232
There arc ln all 447 electoral votes. It requires 224
to elect. The Republican candidate's . election is as
sured, with 8 votes to spare, by the sixteen States" in
cluded In these croups. We may leave Delaware, Mary
land, West Virginia, Oregon, Kentucky; and Ca'ffornia
altogether out of the account. They, were MdClnley
States In ISftG. They would not be Bryan States
year. But the demonstration Is complete in the little
table wo have given. , , r -
In the wide difference between those two forecasts
there is room for almost every person to have an
opinion of his own. It. seems as certain that the
Democrats will renominate Bryan as that the Re
publicans will nominate McKinley ' and the Â¦ con
test, therefore, will be virtually along the old lines.
Nothing has occurred since 1896 to give reason why
any voter who opposed Bryan then should favor him
mow, while in the widespread prosperity of the coun
try under the McKinley administration 'there arc a
multitude of reasons why large numbers of men who
were misled by the silver movement" in 1896 should
vote for sound money this year. ...
Of course speculations concerning the fnture'are
always interesting, and therefore election forecasts
will take their place among, the subjects of conver
sation and news of the year, but it is not at all likely
The Prison Commissioners of Idaho must have
taken a contract for a' life interest in the welfare of
their State convicts. The Commissioners insist thnt
all pardoned criminals must abstain for life from
drinking and gambling. This may be an insinuating
way of suggesting that the convicts should remove
themselves from the earth.
In an address recently at the Academy of Sciences
G. B. Benhaxn quoted history to show that great
municipalities decay under the influence of com::icr
ciaHim. The moral to be deduced, no doubt, is that
San Francisco, with her booming interests, is rush
ing headlong in thr.t direction. What a glorious death
to die!
While the public apology of the Western Turf As
sociation to the California Jockey Club may be an
object lesson in humiliation, it serves better to show
the effects of evil company. . It will take nuorc than
an apology to make Corrigan a fit associate for any
body other thar. his kind.
Russbn railway and steamship agents give us the
assurance that within a very few years San Francisco
will be the third city in importance in the United
States. These complimentary critics must have been
reading one of the ante-election, rainbow speeches of
Mayor Phelan.
An Alamcda Judge has come to the conclusion that
philosophically considered there is not much justifi
cation in punishing people on this earth by the hand
of the law. This may be a polite way in which the
Judge wants to hint that he is looking for anoth-i
job.
Governor Gage seems to be greatly concerned over
the quarantine system for San Francisco. If he has
any personal fears on the subject his absence from
the city will rot be made a theme for regret.
It is reported now that General Methuen is suffer
ing from spinal trouble Tlie Boers show no signs of
anything of the icind.
that the issue will be involved in any doubt when
once the nominations have been made. The Bryan
platform promises to be even more radical.aiid revo
lutionary than before, but it is safe to say that many
Democrats who were swept off their feet by the agi
tation growing out of the bad times have now re
covered their balance and will cast their votes' for
the party of prosperity, leaving Mr. Bryan in such a
hopeless minority that the faction of discontent which
he represents will no longer be a factor in American
politics.

BESTED HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER.
Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce. U. S. N..
retired, has always been noted for his
ready wit,' and a great many stories are
told among naval men of his bright say
ings. But of all of them perhaps the fol
lowing best Illustrates his quick repartee:
When Admiral Luce was a young man,
an ensign or- a lieutenantâ lt matters not
here â it so happened ono summer that his
ship for some days lay at anchor -6ff a
well-known seashoro resort. Of course, the
ofilccrs, young and old, were much fei^d
and were often ashore. One night, after
some function or other, a party of th*
voting ofllcers. among whom " was Mr.
Luce, set out for the ship. They had had
an excellent time and were feeling very
lolly, laughing nnd talking perhaps rather
hilariously. They drow up to tho ship,
and leaving the boat clambered up thq
gangway. Mr. Luco in tho lead. Tho of
llcer of the deck, hearing so much noise
of mirth, met them with a severe glance
as they stepped on deck. .He looked them
over one by one. and then turning to Mr.
Luce, who was the life of the party, he

LORD ROBERTS ON THE FIELD
p^IELD MARSHAL LORD ROBERTS has ar
| rived in South Africa with General Kitchener as
chief of staff, and the British public is now hold
ing its breath waiting to see what will happen. The
waiters will probably wait a long time. Roberts- is
too old a man to act hastily in a. field to which he
is unaccustomed, and General Kitchener, it is known,
is one of those soldiers who believe in organizing for
victory rather than in undertaking to seize it by a
sudden dash. Even when pitted against the Dervishes
in the Soudan Kitchener toak two years to prepare
himself for the conflict, made every movement slowly
and deliberately, and advanced no faster than he could
build his railroad. The general who displays so much
of prudence in an attack upon poorly armed barba
rians is hardly likely to be guilty of rashness in a war
against a foe which has proven itself to be so-dan
gerous as the Boers.
The favor with which Roberts is regarded by Brit
ish soldiers is something extraordinary. An ex
chaplain of the British army in a recent sketch of him
contributed to the New York Sun says: -"Field Mar
shal Lord Roberts is a remarkable personality. In
the first place he is, like the great Wellington, an
Irishman, and never fails to awaken, the enthusiasm
of the sons of Erin. Then his name is one to charm
with throughout the whole of India, where he is
feared and dreaded on the one hand and beloved and
honored on the other from Cape Comorin to the
Oxus River. 'Bobs' never knows when he is de
feated. I remember when lie achieved his victory in
the Kuram Valley; his officers declared that he was
defeated, but Roberts never knew it. and awoke next
morning as a victorious general ready for the fray."
The same correspondent approves of the report
that General Roberts, before leaving London, ad
vised that a large force of. native Indian cavalry be
sent to South Afrjca for service, and says: "And
why not? The Sikhs and Goorkhas for the last fifty
years have been the most loyal troops in the British
army, and a few regiments' of Punjab cavalry would
have saved General Buller from defeat. Ordinary!
folk have- the impression that the native army of,
India cannot be trusted. But there never has been.;
during the most trying periods of British rule in
India, the least doubt as to the loyalty of the Sikhs
and Goorkhas. and they are as much a part of the
forces of the empire as the loyal legions of Canada
and Australia." -
Whether the general will undertake an advance. at
once or try waiting tactics remains to be seen.
Political reasons exist for an immediate advance. It
is estimated that the war is costing Great Britain up
ward of two hundred million dollars a month, and the
Ministry needs at this time, a victory in order to re
tain its hold upon the Commons. Therefore both for
the sake of saving expense by shortening the war and
for the purpose of achieving a victory .wliicii will
strengthen the- Government, the , field; marshal j may
be inclined to make an immediate advance in force/
On- the- other hand, military reasons incline in favor
of delay. ;He has everything to gain by xvniting for
reinforcements and artillery, while the Boers, oh the
other hand, likq all irregular armies, will suffer- from
every month-of inaction.

THE SITUATION IN KENTUCKY.
LATE reports from Kentucky are to the effect
that the Republican leaders, while not aban
doning the right against Goebel in the Legis
lature, arc expecting assistance from Washington to
cid them in seating Taylor in the event that Gocbcl
should be counted in by the Legislature. It is not
clear what sort of aid the Republican* expect the
Federal Government to give. If, under the law of
Kentucky, the Legislature has the right to count
the vote and decide who has been elected Governor,
the Federal Government has no right to interfere.
One of the Republican leaders, Major A. T. Wood,
IS quoted as saying: "Taylor has been elected, and
if he is turned out by an arbitrary board we could not
countenance its action. We should fight if it be neces
sary." Worse advice than that it will be impossible
for the Republicans to receive from any source. The
belief that Taylor was elected is founded on ample
evidence. The returns of the election on their face
show a majority in his favor, and the State Election
Commission, although a Democratic body, Rave a
certificate of election to the Republican candidate. If
rcw the Democratic Legislature should reverse the
action of the Election Commission and#?eat Goebel,
the action would be an outrage, but there would be
no recourse left except to submit an appeal to the
people or to the courts, in case the law of Kentucky
provides any appeal to them from the Legislature.
Under any circumstances an attempt to rc?ist by
force would be ruinous to the Republican prospects
in Kentucky for the reÂ«t of this generation. Such
tactics would not have the support of the Republicans
elsewhere md would be certain to fail. It is to be
hoped the Republican leaders in Kentucky will be
too '.veil advised to make a movement which would
injure the chances of the party to earn' the State this
fall. There -.va? a strong popular protest in'th; last
election against Goebel's tactics, and it was led by
some of the ablest Democrats in the State. It is
therefore safe to say that if his partisans in the Legis
lature count him in unjustly the public indignation in
the State would make the State Republican for years
to come. > -,-,.

FROM the developments which have been made in the affairs of the Police Commis
sion it has become evident that a part of the programme arranged is the appoint
ment of Jules J. Callundan to the office of Chief of Detectives. The mere sugges
tion of such a man â¢'or so important a position is sufficient to arouse the indignation of
all who know anything. about the career of Callundan and the power which will be placed
in his hands by appointment to that office.
Up to the present time The Call has taken no part " in the reorganization of the
Police Department, but has contented itself with the presentation of the news. Now,
however, since it has become evident that it is the intention to turn the department over
to men who are in favor of allowing the largest license for gambling and blackmail, The
Call enters a protest on behalf of the people and gives warning that if the programme
be carried out this paper will not cease its efforts on behalf of decency and morality un
til the entire plot has been exposed and defeated by arousing public indig-
It appears that Mayor Phelan, for the purpose of obtaining support during his cam
paign, agreed to turn the Police Department over -to men who design to use it for their
own advantage. Callundan was put on the police force at the request of Dan Burns by
the manipulation of Mose Gunst. The people will, remember that not long ago Gunst,
who was then a Police Commissioner, declared himself in favor of making San Francisco
a "wide open town." By that phrase was meant that this city should be a place in which
gamblers and all the toughs and touts that follow the gambling fraternity should have
unlimited license to ply their nefarious trades. The desire of Gunst was defeated for the
time. It now appears that through the eagerness of Mayor Phelan to obtain a. re-election
Gunst and those who act with him have obtained a virtual control of the department, and
their tools are to be placed in positions where, instead of enforcing the laws of the city,
they can give protection to the blackleg's. .:;Â£>:
In this situation the public looks to the newly appointed Commissioners for protec
tion. These /nen have borne good reputations in the community and have had the es
teem of the people, not only in the professions which they follow, but in social life. They
will lose all that esteem if they consent to carry out the programme to which they have
been pledged. There are some promises which, like those customs of which Shakespeare
spoke, "are more honored in the breach than in the observance," and this is one of
them. No pledge that could have been given will justify the Police Commissioners 'in
appointing as Chief of Police a man who will make such a man as Callundan chief of the
detective force. It would be a virtual surrender on their part to the basest elements of the
city, and something like an actual association with the gamblers and thugs who expect to
profit by the programme.
The Call has no fear of any favoritism the Police Department may show to other
papers in the matter of news. It has ample facilities for obtaining information and can
take care of itseif in that respect. It makes this protest solely in the interest of public
morality. If the proposed police programme be carried out no office nor home nor class
of society will be safe from the corrupting and degrading enticements of gambling., If
Callundan be appointed chief of detectives San Francisco will be wide open to all the
avenues that lead to corruption, degradation, vice, villainy, prostitution and crime. â¢
The Call has proof that Mayor Phelan, by reason of his campaign entanglements,
had no option in the appointing of Police Commissioners. He named men whom the
gang in favor of a wide-open town forced upon him. It is. for these Commissioners, se
lected in that way, to determine whether they will remain pliant tools of the" gang now
that they know for what purpose they are to be used. Their promise was obtained under
false pretenses, for they were not informed of the full extent of the programme. /Since
they have learned that the appointment of the Chief of Police to whom they are. pledged
will entail the further appointment to the office of chief of the detective force of a manJirfi
competent, corrupt, vicious and utterly unworthy hi any respect, they will', be not only
duped, but dishonored, if they perpetrate that offense against the community.

ECCENTRIC LADY
LIVINGSTONE DIES
American Woman's Ca
reer in Paris.
PARIS, Jan. 12.â An eccentric old Amer
ican woman, known at the United States
legation and consulate for the last twenty
years under the name of Lady Living
stone, has died here under extraordinary
conditions, leaving a large fortune for un
known heirs. Her eccentricities and tem
per made constant trouble for her. and it
was chiefly to make complaint of the ac
tions of her neighbors that she called con
tinually on the American officials. Sho
always dressed fantastically, but lived tho
life of a recluse. She had two rooms at
NeuiUy. her only companion being a par
rot, and she always pleaded she was in
reduced circumstances. Not being seen
from Friday last her rooms were broken
Into on Monday, when Lady Livings ton a
was found lying on the floor unconscious
and was taken to a hospital, where sho
died without regaining the power of con
versation. There were Indications that
she had lain on the floor from Friday un
til discovered.
The room was In great disorder. Her
papers and books, coal, wood and scraps
of food were scattered about the place.
Her rooms were taken in charge by the
oinclals of the consulate and were
searched without avail. No will or any
thing designating her heirs was discov
ered. The sum of 1400 francs was found
In the room and the consulate officers also
have in their possession a deposit book on
a prominent bank for a large sum, the
exact amount of which tho officials prefer
not to mention.
The letters found Indicate that the cor
rect name of the deceased was Maria L.
Livingstone and she was 80 years of age.
There was no evidence of foul play. The
body has been embalmed and placed In a
mortuary chapel, and the Consul General
is making efforts to locate her heirs.

SHOT HIMSELF WHILE
HE WAS LYING IN BED
SHOCKING SUICIDE OF CARL H.
BOWERS.
He Had Injured His Spine and the
Accident Caused Him to Become
a Prey to Melancholy.
Carl H. Bowers, enfeebled In mind from
the effects of an accident, committed bul
cide yesterday at his residence at 1005
McAllister street by shooting himself
through the head with a pistol.
Eight weeks ago Bowers was working In
tho car house of the Turk and Flllmore
line and slipped into a pit under onÂ© of the
cars, receiving a severe injury to his spine.
Owing to the Injury he became demented
and was afflicted with melancholia. It was
not suspected that his mania was of a
suicidal tendency and his relatives there
fore did not maintain a close watch upon
him.
Yesterday mornlngf at half-past 7
o'clock his wife was In the kitchen pre
paring breakfast and his son was in an
other part of the house, when they were
horrified on hearing the report of a fire
arm proceeding from the direction of Bow
ers' bedroom. They hastened to the Bcene
only to find the husband and father dead,
with a smoking revolver In his hand. He
had got out of bed, procured his pistol, re
turned to bed and. placing the muzzle of
the weapon to his right temple, fired a
bullet into his brain, killing himself In
stantly.
The deceased was a native of Germany,
48 years old. He was a memoer of King
Solomon's Lodge. F. and A. M.. Yerba
Buena Lodge, A. O. U. W., and the Wood
men of the World. Police Captain Witt
man, master of King Solomon's Lodge, has
assumed charge of the funeral arrange
ments.
Coroner Cole allowed the body to re
main at the house.

he did he has displayed more nerve than
most people give him credit for. As an
evidence that something has been doing
since the raid It was noticeable yesterday
that every "social club" on Sullivan alley
was out of business excepting that oc
cupying the building owned by the May
or's right hand man.
The halo of purity with which Mr. Phe
lan has been trying to surround himself
and his administration Is getting some
pretty hard knocks when the inquisitive
undertakes to get beneath the surface.
Mr. Blggy, as one of Mr. Phelan's ap
pointees, is, presumably, acting under the
Mayor's instructions in the sham battle
with vice in Chinatown. The Mayor In
sists that all his other men must follow
his orders and it Is reasonable to suppose
that Biggy is in the same category.
It would seem then that sincerity Is
lacking when the greatest dens of Infamy
In Chinatown are located In buildings
owned by a member of the Mayor's fam
ily. It is possible that Mr. Phelan's In
fluence does not extend very forcibly to
his own fireside, or perhaps the adminis
tration Is working on the theory that the'
people should be pure and that the coterie
of favored ones that revolve around the
Mayor can be whatever pleases their
fancy.
All of this may be explained to Mr.
Blggy soon enough. He has probably
learned already that his little hatchet
was not made to slash into the doors of
the Sullivan shacks.
The gambling den Is not the only build
ing In Chinatown owned by Mr. Sullivan.
The property on the four corners of Sulli
van alley and Baker court Btands In his
name. None of the buildings are occu
pied for legitimate purposes. Opium
joints, gambling dens and resorts of Ill
fame fill every nook and corner of the
four brick structures. And all of them
have felt the ax and the sledge of Mr.
Phelan's acting Chief of Police. Mr. Sul
livan may not know of the use to which
his buildings are being put. and when he
learns of It he may take a hand himself
at purifying Chinatown. No doubt the
Mayor will request him to do so. At all
events It Is safe to predict that Mr. Biggy
will not repeat the blunder of raiding
premises the ownership of which Is so
close to his political creator.
Up to the present time It seems to be
a "horse" on the acting Chief.

Attorney Ach strorgly asserts that Big

A c.rpy of the complaint was served on
George A. Newhall. president of the com.

in the document to appear before the
board on Tuesday evening nc-xt at 8

of the complaint be served on each of
them.
J-'oiire Commissioner Thomas had not
received a. copy of the complaint, but was
aware of Acting Chief 1 1! spy's campaig-i
in the districts r.arr.ed. He said the latter
was not instructed what to do. tut was
acting en his own judgment.
"The Police Commissioners never pre
tended that Mr. Bifrgy had any power."
he said. "In ny opinion he does not neel
any. He was slmcly appointed to fill a
pap and look out for the interests of the
commission until an appointment was
made. Mis actions are those of a citizen.
lie knew that these evils existed, and he
Jr structed the senior captain and the lat
ter is t.ikir.ff action. The charter does
cot give us the power to appoint tempor

called on Commissioner Blggy to act in
the capacity of Chief of Police. The so
cial evil is a hard thinp to settle. I be
lieve that the women should be kept off
the streetF and should be confined to a
district. The Board of Police CommlÂ«
rior.ers Is not expected to cope witn the
evil. If they were I am sure they would
resign."

MARY PETERMAN
SAYS SIEBE IS
A CONSPIRATOR
Charges Him With a
Grave Offense.
TO CANCEL INSTRUMENTS
CLAIMS HE TRIED TO 808 AND
LOOT HER ESTATE.
He Files a General Denial and in a
Cross-Complaint Asks Leave
to Foreclose on Her
Property.
"In the management of her property the
defendant did not advise her fairly, prop
erly and honestly, but advised her falsely,
fraudulently, wickedly and dishonestly, so
he might obtain and maintain the control
of the property and so handle the prop
erty of this plaintiff that he could loot,
plunder and rob this plaintiff of her estate
and property."
This is the strongest allegation In the
complaint filed by Mrs. Mary Peterman,
widow of the late Henry Peterman, a
capitalist of Mount Eden, near Haywards,
Alameda County, against Frederick C.
Siebe of the firm of Siebe Brothers &
Plagemann, liquor dealers, 322 Sansome
street, in which she seeks to set aside
notes and mortgages for $34,000 alleged to
have been procured from her through a
fraudulent conspiracy. Slebe filed his an
swer and cross-complaint In the County
Clerk's office yesterday; Joined the Issues
and the suit will now go on trial on ita
merits.
In her complaint Mrs. Peterman alleges
that her husband died in 1891, leaving her
his entire estate, which was valued at
SIuO.OOO. As Mr. Slebe was a firm friend
and associate of the deceased she decided
to seek his advice, which he readily gave.
Her son. Henry Peterman Jr. conceived
the idea of cornering the hay crop of the
State, she avers, and Mr. Slebe readily
assisted him to realize his ambition, loan-
Ing him $15,000. Subsequently. Mrs. Peter
man continues, Siebe secured her signa
ture to notes to secure those given by
her son until the amount of her obligation
reached the figure of $34,000. Then he im
portuned her to give him deeds to a por
tion of her property and mortgages for
another. His threat to foreclose these
mortgages, she says, prompted her to file
suit to declare them fraudulent, null and
void. Mrs. Peterman further alleges that
Siebe, while acting as her adviser, falsely
and dishonestly charged her with various
sums of money, which sums she never
received.
In conclusion she prays that an account
ing be had between her and the defend
ant of all matters and things connected
with her property and for Judgment of
the court canceling all of the notes, mort
gages and the deed on the ground that
they were obtained through fraud and
were Issued by her without consideration.
In his answer Slebe denies her allega
tions, sets up the notes, deed and mort
gages in his cross-complaint and asks for
judgment thereon.

REMARKABLE SUCCESS
Of a New Pile Cure.
People who have suffered for months or
years from the pain and inconvenience of
that common disorder, piles, will look
with skepticism upon the claims of the
makers of the new discovery for cure of
all forms of piles, known under the name
of Pyramid Pile Cure; nevertheless the
extraordinary cure's performed by this
remedy are such as to warrant the inves-
tigation of any sufferer. As a case in
point the following letter speaks for
Itself:
Mr. Henry Thomas of sub-station No. 3.
Hosack Aye., Columbus, Ohio, writes as
follows:
Pyramid Drug Co.:
Gentlemen: I want you to use my name
If it will be of any use to you. I was so
bad with the piles that I lost work on that
account. Nothing did me any good. I
read in Cincinnati of the many cures of
piles by the Pyramid Pile Cure and I went
to a drug store and asked for it. The drug
clerk told me that he had something else
that he thought was better, but I told him
that I wanted to try the Pyramid flrst.
The flrst box helped me so much that I
tried another and then to complete the
cure UBed two more boxes, making four in
all. I am now completely cured. Have
not a trace of piles and I had suffered for
four years with the worst form of pro-
truding piles.
I suffered death from piles, but I have
found the Pyramid Pile Cure to be Just as
represented. I have recommended it to
several of my friends and I am thankful
to be able to write you what good the
remedy has done for me.

The new Board of Education held yes
terday morning another of its "dark lan

hour in the privacy of the star chamber
came out Into the open and in a perfunc
tory way ratified as much of the business
transacted as It cared to make public
The executive meeting was called by
President Mark at the suggestion of Mr.
Denman, and it was thought by those
around the board rooms that probably
Mr. Denman and Mrs. Kincald hail agreed
to settle the amount of salary to be paid
the deputies to be appointed by Superin
tendent Webster. Nothing of the sort
happened, however, and it was learned
later that that question was as far from
a satisfactory settlement as ever. It will
be given serious consideration at next
Wednesday's meeting, however, and Su
perintendent Webster is confident of an
amicable arrangement.
In the open meeting yesterday L. A.
Jordan, Assistant t Superintendent of
Schools, was continued in his present po
sition until further order of the board.
The bonds of Secretary Hansen and
Storekeeper McAuliffe were fixed at $3000,
and those of Assistant Secretary Howe
and Assistant Storekeeper Weaver at
$2000. Anit La Faille was appointed team
ster of the department at a salary of $75
per month.
The following appointments of teachers
made by Superintendent Webster were
confirmed: Miss J. Hocheimer, Miss Edna
Cadwalader, Miss Lou Smlthson. Louis

principal of the Hamilton Evening
School, vice Dr. T. B. W. Leland, on leave.
The leaves of absence of Miss F. P.

DOCTOR MAHE'S
SUICIDE RENEWS
AN OLD SCANDAL
Prophecy of Friend
Fulfilled.
NO DIVORCE EVER SECURED
WIFE IS A SISTER OF ATTORNEY
EDWARD LANDE.
The suicide of Dr. Gustave Mahe at
Sioux City, lowa, exclusive particulars of
which were published in yesterday's Call,
has caused a flutter In local circles and
much sympathy Is being expressed for hla
wife on account of a revival of the scan
dal attending the elopement of her hus
band with another woman.
A peculiar fact In connection with the
affair is that the suicide was not unex
pected by several of the former friends
of the physician, one of whom stated that
he had long ago prophesied that Dr. Mahe
would blow out his brains as did his fa
ther before him.
It is now learned that, unknown to all
but two or three persons, Dr. Mahe re
turned here a few months after he had
deserted his wife and remained for two
days. During this brief period he visited
Frank Koenig, a Kearny street shoe mer
chant, who was one of his moat intimate
friends. It is asserted that the reason
he came back was to try to induce his
wife to grant him a divorce. This she de
nies.
Mrs. Mahe is the sister of Edward
Lande of the law firm of Rlordan & Landa
and lives at 1027 Golden Gate avenue. She
is a pretty woman, rather under the av
erage height. Her maiden name was Jo
sephine E. Lande.
"My husband was always a lover," she
said, "and when he returned from France,
after securing the fortune left him by a
relative, brought me a number of costly
presents. There was nothing In his de
meanor to show that his affections had
been transferred elsewhere and the knowl
edge that he had deserted me was a se
vere blow.
"Dr. Mahe and I were married In 18S0.
He disappeared on June 6, 1897. During
this period of seventeen years nothing oc
curred that could possibly have been con
strued as a quarrel. The statement that
we were divorced is untrue, as I do not be
lieve In divorces.
"I was visiting the family of ex-Con
gressman Phelps, near Redwood City,
when my husband went away. He and
Mr. Phelps were the best of friends and I

at his death may be, she Is not his wife,
as we have never been divorced. That
woman has brought ruin first to me and
then to him. It could not have been finan
cial difficulties that caused him to take his
life, as ho had plenty of money. He took
$25,000 In cash out of the bank when he
departed and left me penniless. If he
ever returned here I did not know it, and
I have never heard a word from him since
he departed."

TEACHERS FIGHTING
FOR THE TAX FUNDS
THOMAS' SUIT STILL OCCUPIES
JUDGE MURASKY.
Motion to Dissolve the Order Enjoin
ing the Auditor From Paying
Claims Taken Under
Advisement.
The attempt of the teachers to have
Judge Murasky dissolve the restraining
order in the case of J. M. Thomas, tho
State blackboard man, against the teach
ers and Janitors came up for hearing yes
terday. Warren Olney Jr. argued on be
halr of the teachers that the merchants
would not be injured even if the teachers
did break their agreement, because the
merchants could break the agreement aloo
and pay themselves out of the money al
ready drawn on their claims; also that
each teacher could do as she saw flt with
reference to her warrant.
Mr. Brownstnne, attorney for plaintiff,
maintained that the teachers had agreed
to pro-rate their claims with the mer
chants and that they should not be al
lowed to break the agreement until the
court of equity was certain they were go
ing to carry it out. He hinted that there
was some sinister motive on the part of
the teachers.
Mr. Roblson, also attorney for plaintiff
claimed that if the court dissolved the in
junction two hundred teachers could col
lect all their money and then turn around
and say they had never signed the agree
ment, and the other thousand teachers
and Janitors would go to the Union Trust
Company and demand their share of the
$350,000 that company would have collect
ed, and thus the merchants would have
to give up $$000 because the teachers broke
their agreement. .
The matter was taken under advise
ment.
MILLS GIRLS
HEAP NEVADA
Mme. Emma Nevada's third concert
was somewhat delayed yesterday after
noon to await the arrival of a throng of
girls from Mills College, who attended in
a body one hundred and twenty strong,
the guests of their distinguished co-ed.
Such an outpouring of femininity has sel
dom been seen and the girls brought with
them a store of enthusiasm, which must
have resulted in innumerable 6plit
gloves. Women do not usually succeed in
making much noise when they applaud
but on this occasion the intention was
very earnest and the result very satis
factory indeed.
There were baskets and baskets of
flowers handed over the footlights and
a huge wreath, the tribute of the student
body, which Mme. Nevada, whose hands
were quite laden down with roses, put
around her neck to the evident and clam
orous satisfaction of her young friends
Her first number was the mad scene
from "Lucia," with flute accompaniment
by air. Newbauer. She sang subsequently
"A Tale of Two Apples," a new song by
I>a.ura Hedgwick Collins, in which the
humor and pathos of the words are curi
ously and quaintly inconsistent with their
very serious musical setting.
"You and I." by Liza Lehman, followed
and Jaubert's "Vogel im Walrie." For an
?Â¦ncore fÂ»he sang ''Laissez moi, bergere "
in which her voice. and style showed to
the best advantage. Her last number
waÂ« the Hondo from "Somnambula." in
which opera bhe made her greatest tri
umphs here some years ago.
Mr. S^lden Pratt improves on acquaint
ance, his playing of "Wldmung" (Schu
mann-Llfzt) being very creditable. He is
very satisfactory Indeed as an accompan
ist. Mr. Blumenberg played with his ac
customed skill. He was encored after
the "Serenade Badine," by Gabriel Marie
and gave Popper's amazing "Spinning
Wheel" with rare facility. Two other
numbers by Popperâ "Begegnung" and a
"Spanish Dance âdisplayed his versatil
ity, as well as his faultless technique.
Mme. Nevada, It is eald, will be heard
in one more concert, which, if the ar
rangements are made, will occur at the
California Theater on Monday evening
January 23. To-morrow she is to sine at
Mills College In Oakland.

LAUNDRY GIRLS DEFIED
ACTING CHIEF BIGGY
STROKE OF DIPLOMACY AVERTS
A BIG STRIKE.
Foreman Discharged a Girl for a
Trivial Mistake and Is Forced
to. Take Her Back.
Police Commissioner and Acting Chief
W. J. Biggy has troubles of his own at
home as well as in Chinatown. Ten young
women who Etarch and press wrinkles out
of shirts In the United States Laundry,
over which the Commissioner holds even
greater sway than he does in police cir
cles, indignantly refused to work yester
day, and for a time the wheels In the
cleaning establishment refused to revolve.
It was a calamity that was only overcome
by masterly diplomacy. At first the act
ing Chief bethought himself of the power
thrust Â«i>on him by the Mayor, and he
was about to telephone for a posse of
bluecoats. but he feared it would be neces
sary to remove a squad from the Celestial
quarter. He theretore valiantly sallied
forth among his angry but still defiant
wic'.ders of flatirons and appeased their
wrath by promising to remove the cause
of their complaint.
The Chief then learned that one of his
foremen had roughly rebuked one of the
"laundry ladies" for washing the stripes
out of a yari-eolored shirt, and as she was
not used to such treatment she replied In
kind. Tho fortman remembered that his
superior was h'.ph in office and was Fend
ing people to Jail without discrimination
as to age. parcntag-e, past condition of
servitude or where they had thrjr shirts
laundered. Â£o fee promptly "fired"' the
lady. Other ladios in the establishment
took umbrae* M his cruel treatment and
they combined against him. They an
nounced their determination to leave soap
suds and flatirons to grrow cold if "lizzie"
was not taken back into the fold. The
foreman was obdurate, and the laun
dresses completed their threat. Chief
lilggy hoisted a flag of truce, sued for
pf-ace at any price, and finally agreed to
take the offending girl back.
It was then that the wheels of the laun
dry turned aÂ«ain, and the acting Chief
left for Chinatown to oversee the work of
his minions who were demolishing doors
and ether property.
Thus it was that a lone girl and a plucky
eet of companions defied the head of the
local Police Department.

ENGLISH POLICY
NOT SUPPORTED
BY AUSTRALIANS
Thousands in Sympa
thy With Boers.
THINK THE CAUSE UNJUST
?
VOLUNTEERS COMPOSED OF
ADVENTUEEBS.
According to J. F. Archibald, editor and
proprietor of the Sydney, N. S. W., Bul
letin, one of the leading newspapers of
the antipodes, Australia on the Boer
question Is a house divided against itself.
Krom what has heretofore been published
in this country it looked as though the
British colonies were in hearty sympathy
with the mother country In the present
trouble and were standing shoulder to
shoulder to protect the glory of the Eng
lish flag and to spread the dominion of
Anglo-Saxon power.
A short talk with Mr. Archibald, who
is one of the leading thinkers and writers
in the Australian field of journalism, will
convince any one that such is not alto
gether the case. Mr. Archibald is, him
self, In hearty sympathy with the follow
ers of "Oom" Paul and strongly opposed
to what he calls the oppression and injus
tice of English greed. As his paper is the
strong advocate of its owner's views and
voices them on every opportunity, it is
fair to presume that, as its circulation is
not only large, but has since the outbreak
ot the present trouble in Africa, been
steadily increasing in the number of its
subscribers, Mr. Archibald Is correct when
he says his sentiments and views are
echoed by many thousands of his fellow
countrymen.
"While there are many people in Aus
tralia who are war-mad and anxious for
trouble, and while there is a majority of
the population whose sympathies are with
the mother country, right or wrong," said
Mr. Archibald yesterday, "yet there are
many thousand Australians who are bit
terly opposed to the prosecution of a
cause which they consider is founded on
greed and injustice and the prosecution
of which has no other excuse than that
offered by the might of the power insti
tuting It.
"The Boers are In exactly the same situ
ation that the thirteen colonies were at
the outbreak of the American revolution.
Kruger is to his country what William
Tell was to Switzerland, Kosciusko to
Poland and Washington to this country.
He la fighting for the very existence of
his people against rapacity and tyranny
and he deserves the sympathy of every
fair-minded man.
"I am strongly in favor of the Boers
because of the righteousness of their
cause and there are thousands of my
people who think as I do. We very much
resemble the different members of a large
family, the husband and father of which
has done wrong. While we feel like pun
ishing the old man ourselves, yet we hate
to see him humiliated by outsiders,
though when he Is humiliated, we are
forced to acknowledge among ourselves
that he has received only his just de
serts.
"England should not look for any help
from her colonies. There is no reason
why they should give it to her. They
have no voice in making war. ! She does
that herself. Consequently when she
gets into a war, particularly one so un
just as the present, she should not ex
pect her colonies to take part In fighting,
the preliminaries of which they had no
hand in arranging.
"It is true that a number of volunteers
have gone to the Transvaal, and there are
any number more that arc filled with the
enthusiasm of military glory and anxious
to get to the front. These are not actu
ated, however, by patriotism or any other
high motive. All men are sports, and in
none Is the sporting trait more strongly
developed than in the native Australian.
The war has given them a new field for
sport and adventure. They are wild to
have a try at this new game, and volun
teer for the pure love of adventure and
danger. Many of thorn say that they
will have good sport while the war lasts,
and Africa will be a good place' ln which
to settle permanently after hostilities are
over. From the way things have been
going it would appear to tho casual look
er-on that the Boers, themselves, might
get a little fun' out of the scrimmage, and
that some of these adventurous gentle
men will be enabled to take up a per
manent residence in the country without
waiting for the cessation of hostilities.
"Australia has nothing to be grateful
for to the old country. She was treated
in the beginning very much as was the,
Colony of Virginia â made a dumping
ground for the offscourings, a place to
put the refuse of the parent land. Finally
England saw there was something to.be
made out of Australia, and acted accord
ingly. Nothing was done that did not,
in the end, bring In something In the
way of Interest as a return. We need
no protection .for ourselves from Eng
land. You see the trouble she has had
with a handful of Dutchmen. Well, what
sort of a chance do you think another
power would have with Australia and her
millions of population? If Australia
could not take care of herself under the
existing conditions tfien she would de
serve #o be conquered.
"I suppose the sentiment- In this coun
try Is very much divided. It naturally
would be with thÂ«Â» cosmopolitan popula
tion you have. But the administration,
as I look at It. la doing for England what
England recently did for the United
States In Its little steal of the world's
tobacco crop. She gave this nation her
moral support In that bit of pillage and
now this country la holding off while
England Is trying to get away with the
pold of the Transvaal."
This is. the second visit of Mr. Archi
bald to California. His trio this time Is
purely one of pleasure and he will return
to Sydney on the next Australian steamer.
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â President
David Starr Jordan of Stanford
University made an address to
r.ight at the First Unitarian
Church to a large audience on the
situation In South Africa. He said thnt
his h-ympathies were with England, be
cause this war was forced upon the na
tion by politicians for political and com
merdal reasons, while the Boers are
right.
"My sympathies are most decidedly
with the Englieh people." he said, "for
I believe that ihey are the victims of a
gigantic political bunko game, I have
had pome very painful letters from
friends of mine In Englandâ not from
Radicals, but from members of the mure
conservative Tory parly. 1 know the
general feeling among them is that this
war is something they were brought into
vutirely unawares. You see. it usually
happen* tha.t monarchies bring about eon-
Uicti between the conscience of the people
and certain acts carried on in the name
Ot the people. We sometimes flnd mon
arcliies In republics. We had such a con
flict in the United State*. I refer to
Flavery. It was to the interest of the
South "to have slaves. It was to the in
terest of the North to keep still about
them, but the conscience of the people
was finally aroused and the conflict was
inevitable.
"The trouble with England is the temp
tation to develop the rabble. We have an
example of this !n making the good
Queen the Empress of India and in the
Vuttai's jubilee to impress the world with
England's greatness. This was done to
divert the minds of the oeople. When
the English people demand a reform they
g< t the tjueen's jubilee or the Queen is
piven another title, 1 pay it is possible to
debauch the people with noise.
"The ancient roots of the present bluster
were gown by James I. It has been car
3i''d on by Disraeli, Chamberlain and Ce
cil Rhodes, who Is a sort of Boss Tweed
of Bouth Africa, A Russian writer has
said that "he who has drunk will drink.'
England has drunk of power over her en
Â«mies and Phe probably can't help her-
Fclf. To keep the British satisfied you
must lire the British heart, so all along
her frontier they have wars. When there
is serious trouble at home they must stir
up one Â«>f those distant wars.
"As a rule England never stirs up ac
tual fighting if the people on the other
tide have clothes on.
"It Is not Er.cland but Chamberlain,
who has England in his power. His policy
is to keep sore places along the borders
<f her possessions. That is why there is
trouble between Canada and the United
States. That Is why there was trouble In
Venezuela. She Is always willing to arbi
trate, because, in nearly every case, arbi
tration with her means splitting the dif
ference. England pats on the back the
nation she can use, but never removes
the cause of complaint. The basis of her
policy is Inequality among men. It has
always been and that is why our forefath
ers left England.
"The Englishman feels that he Is a little
better than anybody else. England's idea
tit a vigorous foreign policy is never to
Ftrike except when the enemy is down
and has no powerful neighbor; and never
to strike below the belt when the vulner
able points are above.
"Chamberlain says there must be Eng-
lish supremacy in South Africa. We could
say the same thing about North America.
Why hasn't a little people aa many rights
as a mighty people? The great thing that
crushes a nation, or causes it to degener
ate, is war. In our trouble with Canada
over the fur seals the Premier said to me
that he didn't care a snap of his finger
for the whole fur question, but the ques
tion would be kept open. Now they want
a port on the Lynn Canal in Alaska. The
tribunal in Paris that decided the seal
question was no more worthy of respect
than the most contemptible police court
It was the same policy of overreach and
then split the difference. The people who
are talking to us now about brotherhood
and cousinship are the same 6table boy
aristocrats that flouted at Abraham Lin
coln. Is it surprising that they don't
ccc why we won t join Canada and come
in under the flag?
"Let me tell you that no country can
be stable that is held by force; no land
can be annexed permanently so long as it
is necessary to wield the sword to hold
it. South Africa was settled by the
Dutch. When the Dutch moved over into
the Transvaal the English claimed that
they were still British subjects. This
claim was admitted by the Dutch and
then abandoned by the British. The claim
of suzerainty has been revived by Cecil
Rhodes and his ilk for certain purposes.
"This war has caused one side to cay
the Boers are corrupt, another side that
the English are to blame, but I say it
makes not a particle of difference which
is right. There is no Justification for a
mighty nation to gro to war with a weak
one. All claims of British suzerainty were
given up by Gladstone and I say he did
the square thing by a little nation. I say
the outsiders had no right to vote in the
Transvaal. One of the causes of this
war, it is said, was the cry "Remember
Majuba Hill.'
"That cry and our 'Remember the
Maine' were born of the passions of war
and are therefore wrong. Other causes
are that the Boers are liars, that they
don't bathe once in a week, that they ping
psalms through their noses and that they
are not Dutch, anyway, but French Hu
guenots. A better reason is that Rhodes
demands the money In their mountains
and Rhodes Is a part of Chamberlain's
scheme, or Chamberlain is a part of
Rhodes' scheme, I can't say which.
"This war started with Dr. Jameson's
raid, and although Jameson was punished
the English would have followed and
taken in the whole country If he had been
?ucce?sful. Chamberlain says they want
racial equality. What about the great in
disma-Uon over the arrival of Russian
Jews in Englfind?
"No doubt England will go to pieces be
fore the end of the century, Just as the
great Spanish empire went to pieces in
the last century- KJpling- has said 'Send
forth the best ye breed' in a cynical mood,
but that is what England is doing. The
empire is sending forth to war the best
it breeds year after year, and as time
goes on it can breed only the second best.
That is the eau?e of the downfall of
Rome. The best blood was sent forth to
fall on the battlefield, while the stable
boys and the scullions remained at home,
and it was from them that the present
Italians descended.
"Every nation that has . gro\m in
strength has grown in peace, and every
nation has gone down in arms. The policy
of oppression must (rfve way to sobriety,
industry and lustice."

THE cargo of the Algoa. the largest freight steamer that ever arrhea

remarkable things are being learned about her capacity for carrying
freight. For Instance. In one odd comer of her hold the Â« J" c u^

Physicians recommend the Pyramid Pile
Cure because It contains no opium, co-
caine, or mineral poison of any kind, and
because It Is so safe and pleasant to use,
being painless and applied at night. The
patient Is cured in a surprisingly short
time with no Inconvenience whatever.
The Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold by drug-
gists at 50 cents per package, and if there
is any constipation it is well to use the
Pyramid Pills at the same time with the
Pile Cure, as constipation is very often
the cause of piles and the pills effectually
remove the costive condition. Price of pills
is 25 cents per package.

DR. GUSTAVE MAHE, WHO DIED BY HIS OWN HAND.WHILE there have been no large
sales of real estate reported dur
ing the past week, brokers are
In a very pleasant frame of
mind. It has been a long time
since the demand for good Investment
properties was as active as now, and a
number of big deals are practically closed,
the facts being withheld until the deeds
are passed, for obvious reasons.
The two notable events of the week were
the recording of the deed to the Baldwin
Hotel site and the mortgaging of the
Blythe block to the United States Mort
gage and Trust Company of New York
for $1,000,000. Mrs. Blythe-Moore intends
to use a large fraction of this million dol
lars in erecting one or more buildings on
that portion of the property between
Brooks alley and O'Farrell street.
It is alsp stated that Mr. Flood will
shortly begin the erection of a splendid
store and office building on the Baldwin
Hotel site. With these contemplated im
provements on the main thoroughfare of
the city property in that vicinity Is bound
to command attention and naturally In
crease In value very perceptibly.
Baldwin & Howell report the following
recent sales: Lot on Twenty-first street,
east of York, $1050; Eleventh avenue
.south of M street, 50x120 feet in size, $500;
entire block (No. 13) in Castro-street Ad
dition, $5000; lot on north side of Dorland
street, west of Guerrero, 50x115, $2500; two
lots on Folsom street, between Thirteenth
and Fourteenth, $1850 each; lot on the
north side of Fourteenth street, east of
Folsom, $1600; two lots on Nineteenth
avenue, south of H street. $750 apiece; lot
on the west side of Eighteenth avenue,
south of H street. $600.
The purchaser of the Leon Kauffman
property on the corner of Ellis street and
Carlos place, Just east of Mason street,
was Mrs. Minnie P. Shotwell. She will
complete the five-story building now in
course of construction on the site, which
will bring her total investment up to
$130,000.
W. H. Thornley of Gardner & Thornley,
Custom-house brokers, has bought a lot
50x120 feet on the east line of Nineteenth
avenue boulevard, 150 feet south of H
street, for $1450, and has started to build
the first house In the block.
The lot 40x87:6 feet and improvements
on the southwest corner of Golden Gate
avenue and Webster street has been sold
by Emlle C. Quenel to G. A. Wangen for
$19,000.

for $10,000.
The loans upon city real estate of the
local savings banks, building associations
and private capitalists for the week end
ing January 6 amounted to $355,275, against
$104,225 for the previous week. The sav
ings banks loaned a total of $364,300, as
follows: Hlbernia, $117,650; German, $7900;

were $185,255, showing that much new
money found lodgment last week.
Twelve new building contracts, aggre
gating in value $73,749, were filed during
the week ending January 11. The largest

XIV. FOOD FOR INVALIDS AND
CHILDREN.
Owing to differences of temperament
and constitution every case of feeding
needs individuallzation, and where there
is doubt on the subject, even In conditions
of health, the advice of an authority on
the subject should be sought. Fortu
nately for both invalids and children, sci
entists and physicians are inclined to pay
special attention to this important phase
of preventive medicine, and it Is possible
for mother, nurse and physician to co
operate on food questions with some hope
of achieving desirable results.
The study of dietetics as applied to the
nursery and the period of childhood, as
well as In its relation to invalids, requires
practical application of theory to indi
vidual needs, no matter what system of
feeding Is decided upon. Parents must
understand that what is provided for the
average table in the way of food may not
always be given with impunity to children.
Well-trained nurses and expert physicians
appreciate more fully than parents the
benefit in disease that comes from well-se
lected, properly prepared and thoroughly
assimilated food. Parents as a rule and
many untrained nurses forget, althou^n
they may acknowledge the importance of
the fact, that the food an adult can re
ceive and assimilate does harm to the
tender organs of a childâ organs that de
pend very largely for their development
upon a proper selection and administra
tion of assimilable" food. Carelessness and
ignorance at this period of life are quick
ly followed by pernicious results.
The treatment of almost all diseases re
quires the special application of food prin
ciples, and many of them, especially In
children, may be avoided by care in tbi3
direction. Any one who will study the
nature of food products, whether nitro
genous, carbonaceous or mineral, their
proportion of waste and water, those
needed to build tissue, furnish heat,
purify the blood, etc., will comprehend at
once the value of dietetic knowledge in
the selection and preparation of the food
required under special conditions. Dr.
Burnet of London says this knowledge is
the foundation of sound practical diet
etics, and the subject is one of the great
est importance. Dr. Rotch. professor of
diseases of children at Harvard, says in
"Pediatrics": "Just as the highest aim in
medical art should be directed to the
province of preventive medicine, so the
highest and most practical branch of pre
ventive medicine should consist of the
study of the best means for starting
young human beings in life. â¢ â¢ â¢ It is
a proper or an Improper nutriment which
makes or mars the perfection of the com
ing beings in life. â¢ â¢ â¢ We should be
guided by what nature hag taught "is
throughout many ages in studying the
form of nutriment suitable for an especial
period of life." ? . ,
A nourishing diet must be supplied dur
ing the entire season of a child's youth,
and at the same time be supplemented by
favorable hygienic surroundings and by
plenty of exercise of various kinds to call
every set of muscles into play, lack of
sufficient exercise diminishing tissue
change. During this early period of life
larger supplies of certain food elements
are required than in adult life, when
physical growth has ceased and bodily
activity has grown less. It must also bfc
understood that under various conditions
in the life of the same child different
foods and quantities will be required. The
diet must be adapted to the power of the
constitution at the time, and it must be
of the highest nutritive value possible for
present digestive power. If the child's
digestion is normal and its life an active
and out-of-door one it can assimilate
more and stronger food than if, from vari
ations in climate and other causes, it
leads a more quiet life, and if for any
reason its digestion is not up to the nor
mal standard, consideration must be given
Particularly to quantity and assimilation,
t must always be remembered that eat
ing, through repair, is intended to bal
ance, not to increase, the waste caused
by the constant action and Changs going
on In the organs. This waste, if not fully
counterbalanced, will soon cause suffer
ing and illness, but the mistake so con
fetuntly met with of overfeeding must be
absolutely avoided. The amount of nutri
tion in the cases of delicate children and
of invalids must be even more carefully
considered. One of the most important
reasons for this is that energy must not
be wasted in getting rid of superfluous
material, as organic disease may result.
A little food thoroughly digested is far
better than much that is half digested. It
is necessary to understand how to supply,
as nearly as possible, the same materials
that the body is regularly losing, as, for
Instance, when we give heat-forming food
in cold weather and liquid in hot weather.
Drink constitutes food as well as what
we eat.
As each nutritive Ingredient serves its
owi. peculiar purpose, it can readily be
seen why it is necessary for a mother,
nurse or physician to understand some
thing of the elements of food and their
action. A mother or nurse should be able
to detect immediate needs in Individual
cases, as on account of proximity they
are generally the only ones who notice
the dally variations in conditions requir
ing dally modifications of diet. While
they need not actually cook the food re
quired, they should know just what to se
lect under certain conditions and exactly
how to have It prepared. They should not

THE NATIONAL UNION.
Entertainment by a Fraternal Order
That Was Enjoyed by a Large
Audience.
The entertainment and dance given in
Golden Gate Hall last Thursday night by
the National Union Social and Literary
Club under the patronage of the San
Francisco Cabinet of the union was at
tended by an audience .that not only filled
every seat In the hall, but forced'many to
stand during the performance. Tho pro
gramme was high class In every particu
lar and each number was a gem. After
selections by the Slchel orchestra Miss
Cecil Haas entertained with "To-morrow
at Tea." a monologue; the Sisters Porsh
presented "La Dance de Tarentella"; Miss
Abelle Healy gave "The Window Curtain,"
a monologue; Signor Abramoff sang the
invocation from "Robert le Dlable"; Miss
Laura E. Person grave as a recitation
"The High-backed Chair and the Blue
Woolen Dog"; Miss P. Sandolin rendered
"The Island of Dreams," a mezzo-soprano
solo; Leo Cooper gave an entertaining
and well rendered monologue; Miss Aman
da d'Australle Corcoran gave as a so
prano solo "The Holy City." The last
number was "Drifted Apart." a sketch in
one act. by George A. Dennleon and Miss
May Sullivan, assuming two roles. A pro
gramme of up to date dances followed,
keeping the lovers of the whirls together
until midnight. The club proposes to give
a similar entertainment several times a.
year.
only be able to note by results whether
directions have been carried out but also
be willing, if necessary, to see to it per
sonally that this ia done. A little super
vision judiciously applied will frequently
prevent difficulties that are likely to oc
cur as a result of carelessness upon tho
part of servants.
One should seek to know the changes
needed in health, illness and intermediary
stages. In illness this knowledge would
enable one to ably supplement the effort:*
of physicians and in cases of slight indis
position one might frequently be able to
seize the opportunity through careful diet
of overcoming ailments which, uncared
for, might prove serious. For Instance,
If one recognized the fact that the elim-
Inative processes were hampered ona
would cut down albuminoids, as, for in
stance, in cases of constipation, the supply
of fruit, vegetables, cereals, etc., should
be relatively greater in menus than milk,
eggs, meat. etc. Again, as the preparation,
intervals and amounts in feeding children
and invalids are of equal importance, with
such knowledge as is indicated one would
be likely to feed less at a time and maka
the occasion more frequent, and the food
would be more daintily prepared, in order
to make it more easily assimilated than ia
required for conditions of health. In casea
of illness one would fully realize that suc
cess in treatment depends very largely
upon the trouble taken in the combina
tions and preparation of the foods that
are allowable and one would endeavor to
give as varied a diet as the necessary lim
itations would allow. In such considera
tion temperaments must always be studied
and taste 3 and likings consulted, which
questions are of the greatest importance
through the Influence they exert on the
digestion of food.
Naturally following as a result of such
study, the fact would be discovered that
more liquid fo<id should be used than is
common and less of solid. The giving of
water is one of the most important fea
tures of invalid and infant feeding. Many
conditions require it and it la healthful
at all times unless in rare stages of ill
ness when it would be forbidden by the at
tending physician. It is not unusual to
deprive infants almost entirely of water
because they drink milk. The fact is
overlooked that milk, though a liquid out
of the body, becomes in the stomach a
solid food, containing all the nutriment
for an infant's normal growth. Irregular
action of natural laws of the body is not
infrequently the result of such depriva
tions and can easily be corrected by the
use of what may appear to many to be an
excess of water.
Among the uneducated, strong in the old
theory of teething being the necessary
cause, it Is a very common custom to look
tolerantly upon serious infantile ailments.
"Errors in diet and consequent disorders
of digestion, which frequently give rise
to violent convulsions in infancy, would
occur less frequently if," as has been
aptly said by a physician, "for 'teething'
we would read 'stomach and feeding'; and
if we would always consider whether
these are at fault we might, although
proving disagreeable and troublesome at
times to the mothers and nurses, do mar a
good to the suffering Infants."
If food Is not such as the digestion can
master it Is useless and can only do harm.
Not being turned to proper account, the
blood receives no new supply and la im
poverished; there Is no nourishment given
for development of body, and inherited
tendencies to various diseases are encour
aged by those whose duty it is to provide
food of a nutritious quality and to <Â»te
that it is carefully administered. Many
of the diseases to which children are liable
would disappear entirely under strict su
pervision ot hygiene and diet, especially
the various intestinal disorders, including;
many resultant throat, catarrhal ana
nervous troubles. Nature resents care
lessness and Is relentless In her punish
ment. What the doctor calls cholera ln
fantum, rickets or marasmus, etc.. and
the mother is often Inclined to consider a
dispensation of Providence, Is only too
frequently the direct result of violations
of the most common laws of home science.
The whole study of feeding children and
Invalids may appear to be a vast one, yet
it resolves itself into a few simple and
generally acknowledged facts. The evil
conditions that arise from improper feed
ing are not always the result of lack of
knowledge, but very frequently because
what we know we do not do. when en
deavoring to apply the principles of food
and nutrition we must both know and do.
Knowledge and action must be combined
for good results. The few underlying
principles to remember when studyln?
now to individualize each case of feeding,
whether it be Invalid or child, are these:
1. What is given to an Infant as a sub
stitute food must resemble Its natural
food as closely as possible. This can ba
done with the aid of a physician, upon
whom every child's health should depend
if possible during at least the first twelve
months of its precarious existence.
2. Following infancy comes the more dif
ficult period of childhood, although not
usually considered so, when necessary
supplies of nutriment must be furnished
to repair the constant waste caused by the.
active growth of the child. It is at this
time that the constituents of various foods
should be thoroughly understood and the
amounts necessary for various periods,
the methods of preparation and adminis
tration required, etc. General knowledga
will not be of service at thl3 period un
less directed toward specific study, sucn
specific study taking up the laws of heat
and Its effect on foods during cooking,
the proper balancing of dietaries, the re
lation of fat to food, the use of cereals
and sweets, when and how to uae meats,
eggs. fish, etc., what are the reasons for
the use of inorganic salts, contained more
particularly In green vegetables and fruit,
what foods are laxative in their influence.
which are suitable for winter and which
for summer use, which foods are supple
mentary in certain conditions of rapid
growth and which are basic needs for all
times, as for instance during the school
period, when children so quickly develop
anaemic conditions from overstudy and
lack of hygienic care. These and kindred
subjects come up under this special phase
of the study of foods for children.
3. Following the period of childhood
comes the time for the study of estimat
ing correct quantities and proper selec
tions of food to be used In regulating the
diet suited to the Individual needs of girls
and boys approaching maturity, the ex
cesses to be avoided by those of seden
tary habits and questions of similar im
port.
4. A simple presentation of the physiol
ogy of digestion would undoubtedly serve
to show why there Is need for care In
diet during illness. Inasmuch as every
alimentary organ has its specific work to
do. It Is plain that certain conditions call
for certain foods. When digestion is
faulty or disordered from illness it is nec
essary to know which class of foods is
to be withheld and which should be given,
as, for Instance, In typhoid fever there
must be no tax upon the intestines, and
foods must therefore be given that are
easily absorbed and digested In the stom
ach, such as peptonized milk or beef,
white of egg in water, koumiss, etc. It
Is also necessary to know that In case*
of doubt In illness total abstinence from
food is the safest plan until a physician
can be called, as this Is sometimes the
only way by which absolute rest can be
obtained for the diseased parts. Foussa
grivea of Paris says: -The number of
cases cf disease which can be arrested
In children by Instituting a preventive
diet is almost Incredible." The late Pro
fessor Gross of Philadelphia once said:
"The diet of the sickroom has slain its
thousands and tens of thousands. The
ordinary preparations for the sick are. In
general, not only not nutritious but In
sipid and flatulent. Animal soups are>
among the most efficient supporters of
the exhausted system, and every medical
man should know how to give directions
for their preparation. The life of a man
Is his food." Foussagrlves maintains that
the feeding in Illness Is a question of the
very greatest delicacy, which embarrasses
educated physicians themselves, and that
it Is a subject of Important research.
With opinions like these and many oth
ers not noted to encourage us in our
effort, we may well study further a sub
ject which is of vital Interest in its In
fluence on the happiness of our homes.

POSTUM CEBEAL.
LOST THE TASTE
For Ordinary Coffee.
"It is strar.ge how people will try to
invent some cause for their feeling bad,
rather than to charge the trouble to
some habit they may have that they
have good reason to believe is the real
cause. For instance, all the time that
we were using coffee on our table I was
subject to occasional terrible head-
aches, and my husband was half sick
with nervous troubles.
"We felt satisfied that coffee was the
cause, but were afraid we wouldn't like
Postum Cereal Coffee, and therefore
tried in every way to think that some-
thing in the food, or some other reason,
was the real cause of our troubles.
After reading several articles in regard
to the evil effects of coffee drinking
and the merits of Postum Food Coffee
I became convinced of the truth of the
statements, and called my husband's
attention to them.
"He was skeptical on the subject, but
to please me said we wo-uld give Pos-
tum a trial, co he procured a package
and I made It. but the milk we were
using was of the kind that produced
little cream, and that did not give us
as good a beverage as we found after-
ward could be secured with cream.
However, in spite of the drawback, wÂ»
grew to like the Postum Food Coffee,
and both of us found ourselves greatly
benefited by the change. My head
ceased to trouble me entirely, and my
husband was practically made over.
"We were out of the Postum for a
time, and having coffee in the house
and feeling bo much better we conclud-
ed to try tho coffee again, but in a few
days my headaches came back, so that
we became satisfied where the real
trouble existed. We used Postum for
quite a long time, and still having some
coffee in the house, tried coffee again.
Imagine our surprise In discovering
that we no longer cared for the taste
of the ordinary coffee, so the next
morning we had a rare treat in a cup
of piping hot, delicious Postum.
"Coffee is no longer kept in our
house. Our children are very fond of
the new kind of 'toffee,' as they call It.
and we give them as much as they
want to drink, without fearing to in-
jure their health. I find that it enables

ant supply of milk than I could other-
wise do. Postum Cereal Food Coffee

LEATHER MEN TRYING
TO MAKE HIDES FREE
MEETING CALLED TO OPPOSE
THE TARIFF.
Local Tanners, Leather Dealers, Shoe
Manufacturers and Others Are
Taking Part in the
Movement.
The local dealers In leather and hides,
the tanners and also the manufacturers of
shoes and others who use large quantities
of leather have signed a call for a meet-
Ing to be held In the rooms of the Board
of Trade of San Francisco next Wednes
day afternoon. The purpose is, according
to the language of the call, "to discuss the
hide duty and adopt resolutions favoring
Its repeal, to be forwarded to the Cali
fornia delegation In Congress, and to take
such other action as the best Interests of
the tradÂ© demand." All persons are in
vited to attend who may be interested in
the repeal of that section of the tariff
law which Imposes a duty on foreign
hides.
A. J. Marcus of the S. H. Frank Tanning
Company, who was one of the signers of
the call, explained yesterday the reason
for the meeting. He said that similar
meetings had been held by the leather and
hides men in the Eastern States. Prior to
the enaction of the McKlnley tariff law
there had been no duty on foreign hides.
A bill had recently been introduced by a
Congressman from Massachusetts, which
Is the center of the shoe and leather In
dustry of the United States. The hides
and leather men protested when the sec
tion of the McKlnley bill placing a duty
upon foreign hides was under considera
tion, but their protest was not heeded.
Now the struggle for free hides was about
to be renewed.

CLAIMS TOR DAMAGES.
Sequel to Destruction, of Maclean Hos
pital by Health Officials.
The destruction of the Maclean Hospi
tal and Sanitarium on July 8 last had its
sequel yesterday in the filing of a de
mand for $3027 50 by Dr. H. T. Webster,
representing the value of property belong
ing to him which wasstored in the annex
when the building was destroyed by tho
health officials.
"Inasmuch as the destruction of tho
property was owing to the failure of the
city to provide a suitable pesthouse,"
concludes the petition, "and as the loss
is directly due to this cause, it seems to
be a just and proper charge against the
city."
The property enumerated as destroyed
consists of 934 stereotype plates, 800 copies
of unbound books, 500 pounds of type and
certain printing material.
GOOD MARKET
FOR REALTY
rials. At present cost of large buildings
owners are arguing the fact whether or
not they will receive a fair interest on
their money. A building that will cost
now $100,000 in case of a forced sale in a
few years would not probably command
much more than one-half that amount.
This is a serious point to consider, and is
much used by owners before making up
their minds just what to do in the future.
It is almost self-evident that the present
high prices of certain materials cannot
be maintained for a period of years.
This is the fact which is preventing many
contracts from being closed. It is also
the reason why buildings on Ellis, Mason,
Market and other streets will for the
present be only two or three stories high.
The least fall in the prices of materials,
with a greater prospective decline in thÂ©
near future, will be the signal for a gen
eral increase of building activities all over
the coast."
Four hundred and five mechanics'
liens aggregating in value $127,256
were filed in this city and county
in 1800, against 339, valued at $85,636, in 1593.
Ihe releases of liens for 1599 were 183, val
ued at 554.195. The Building News and Re
view says that the increase in the Hens
during 1839 is partly accounted for by al
lowing a percentage extra owing to the
fact that the building summary showed
an increase of one and a quarter million
of dollars; but that this does not explain
all of the large increase in the amount of
liens. During the year a great many pro
ratas were settled.

THE oldest Fsilor in the world went to sea Thursday on the whaling
bark Gayhead. The articles on Me In the Custom-house read, "Sam
Mlsti, cook, native of China, aged 100 year?." Captain Foley, however,
asserts that the cook must be older than that, because he can remember
things distinctly that took place In the China Seas a century ago.
Sam Mlsti says he went to sea In a man-of-war before the days of steam.
In those days the Yellow Sea was infested with pirates and it was the duty
of the little warship on which he was at work to hunt the sea robbers. The
Chinaman tells with great glee how his ship used to be fixed up to deceive the
pirates. The topmasts would be struck and the yards lowered. Tattered
sails would be shown and the man-of-war made to look as much like a wreck
as possible. Then, when the pirates swarmed alongside boiling water and
boiling tar were poured down on them by some of the jackies, while the
remainder of the crew would not be idle with their guns and cutlasses.
Sam Misti is a little bit of a shriveled-up Chinese, but is still as active as
a kitten. His eyes have no whites to them, so that his face presents a very
peculiar expression. He said Thursday before he sailed that he had been
going to tha Arctic for thirty years and expects to go north again on at least
fix more voyages. He made nearly a <lozen voyages with Captain Lew Wil
liams In the Hidalgo, and is now a protege of that gentleman. Captain Wil
liams says that no one knows Sara'f ageâ not even the Chinese himself.
"The man is a hundred if he is a day." said Captain Williams Thursday,
"and judging from the present state of his health he will live to be at least
150. A better or more faithful cook never went to sea in a vessel, and I'll
guarantee the men on the Gayhead will be well taken care of during her
cruise In the Arctic"
HELD THE NOTE
WHILE IT GREW
OVER TEH FOLD
Allen Howard's Suit Is
Contested.
HERMAN BISHOP HAS A STORY
LOST HIS FURNITURE AND NOW
IS A DEFENDANT.
Pledged His Chattels to Secure a
Small Loan, Paid It Back and
More, but More Is De
manded.
A suit of peculiar Interest, In which the
assignor of the plaintiff, if the defend
ant's allegations are based on fact, has
gracefully ascended the throne deserted
some years ago by Shylock, was up for
hearing before Judge Hunt yesterday, but
owing to the filing of a demurrer went
over for a week. W. F. Sayers, as as
signee of Allen Howard, is the plaintiff
and Herman Bishop, late of 223 A Leaven
worth street, occupies the unenviable role
of defendant. The action is brought to
recover $230 principal and Interest on a
promissory note for $50, secured by a
chattel mortgage, all of which chattels
have long sir.cc passed, it is alleged, into
the hands of the holder of the note.
In his complaint the plaintiff simply
asks judgment on the note with interest,
but the Eton' Is told in the answer which
will be f.l*e by Attorney Albert M. Arm
fctrong, who represents the defendant. In
his answer Bishop admits that he gave
the note for $50, as alleged, on December
3. 1R94, and agreed to pay 10 per cent a
month thereon, in default of which he
agreed to surrender all of his personal
effects, including his English and German
library, student s lamp, desk and acces
sories. He paid the interest for a year
â S00 â and then, finding himself hard press
ed, surrendered his chattels. Howard
took them and Bishop considered the
deal closed. In December of IS9S, how
ever, Howard filed suit to recover the
sum named, but waited a year, the de
fendant alleges, before issuing summons.
Bishop is now preparing to resist the
claim, ap he says $60 interest on a $50
note, coupled with the surrender of his
chattels, which he valued at $303 90. is
sufficient compensation for his benefactor
in his days of need, without the $230,
which would raise the note, principal and
interest to the snug sum of $583 90.
BRITISH SHIP
MUSSELCRAG IS
NOW IN SAFETY
Reaches Sydney in
Distress.
BOUND HERE FROM ANTWERP
RECORD RUN OF THE BARK
NORFOLK ISLAND.
Came Here From Newcastle, Austra
lia, in Forty-Eight DaysâTrain
ing-Ship Adams to Start
on. Another Cruise.
Among the vessels that suffered severe
ly in the October gales oft the Horn was
the British ship Musselcrag. She is now
out 178 days from Antwerp for San Fran
cisco and, as she has put into Sydney,
N. S. W., in distress, it will probably be
another hundred days before she gets
here. According to the reports received
by the Merchants' Exchange yesterday
the vessel is badly strained and the cargo
will have to be discharged and a survey
held before she can come on to this port.
The Musselcrag left Antwerp on July 18
last. On September 10 she was spoken
in latitude 33 south, longitude 51 west.
All through the heavy weather In Octo
ber she was not heard from, nor was
anything seen of her in November and
December. Then the underwriters began
to get uneasy and 10 per cent reinsur
ance was offered on vessel and cargo
When the overdue fleet began .to arrive
and tales of heavy weather and disasters
were told the rate on the Musselcraa
went up to 25 per cent.
At last on January 4 the overdue vessel
was heard from. Captain Johnson had
tired of his battle with the elements off
tape Horn and was coming to San Fran*
Cisco via the Cape of Good Hope. During
the struggle the ship's decks had been
swept clean, the bulwarks were stove in,
nearly a whole suit of sails had been
blown from the bolt ropes, the cabin had
been gutted, the forecastle washed out
and several of the crew had been hurt
When Cape Otway, the most southerly
point in Australia, was sighted, Captain
Johnson stood in and signaled the light
house keeper that his vessel was badly
damaged, but that all hands were well.
At that time it was evidently his inten
tion to come on to San Francisco but
as the hull must have been very foul
and the crew worn out. Captain Johnson
must have considered it the wisest course
to put into Sydney, N. S. W.
The Musselcrag was built in 1896 and is
owned by W. Corsar of Liverpool. She is
1871 tons net burden, 266 feet 6 inches long,
40 feet beam and 23 feet 7 inches deep.
The British bark Norfolk Island arrived
In port yesterday unexpectedly from New
castle, N. S. W. She was listed for Ho
nolulu, but Captain Thomas says this was
a mistake, as his cargo of coal is con
signed to San Francisco parties. The Nor
folk Island made the run across in forty
eight days. This is the banner run of the
season and has only been beaten twice in
ten years. In 1894 the British ship Os
borne made it in forty-seven and in 1897
the Loch Toredon made it in forty-six
days. Strange to say, the Norfolk Island
was exactly twenty-four days from New
castle to the equator and twenty-four
days more from the equator to San Fran
cisco. Both captain and crew -of the bark
are very proud of the showing made by
their vessel, and are confident she will
make an equally good run from here' to
Europe with a load of wheat.
The workings of the new charter made
a number of changes at the Harbor Hos
pital yesterday. Dr. Thompson has gone
to the new City Hall. Drs. Frank B.
Robinson and 11. Morrison will not be â¢Â¦
duty again until February 1, and Drs.
Dorr, Starr and Thome will take waten
and-watch during the remainder of the
month.
The United States training ship Adams
will get away for another cruise early
this morning. The apprentice boys have
been anxious to make a start for quite a
while, but the powers that be ruled oth
erwise. Yesterday all the officers wore
ordered to be aboard at 11:30 p. m., and
with the morning tide the training ship
will put to sea. It was originally the in
tention to go from here to San Diego aÂ«;d
then to Magdalena Bay for target prac
tice, and then for a cruise among th<?
Hawaiian Islands. Since plague news lms
been coming from Honolulu, however, the
Government thought it best to drop the
trip to the Paradise of the Pacific. The
Adams will accordingly come back here
after the target practice in Magdalena
Bay and will then go north for a cruise
in Puget Sound waters. IJeutenant Com
mander Henry Minnett did not go out on
the Adams. At the last moment he was
detached from the training ship and or
dered to the navy yard.
The transport City of Puebla is to sail
from Nagasaki for San Francisco to-day
and in that event should reach here abouf
January 31.
Nicholas George and Peter Black, fire
men on the steamer Ban Juan, had a fight
a few days ago on board the vessel, and
honors were about even. Yesterday morn-
Ing Black wan found on the Mall dock
with an ugly wound In his abdomen. Po
liceman Winzler was notified, and Black
told him that he and George had renewed
the fight and George had stabbed him In
the abdomen. George was arrested and
taken to the City Prison, where he was
booked on a charge of assault to murder
Black was taken to the Receiving Hospial
and later to St. Mary's Hospital. Th<3
wound is a dangerous one and may prove
fatal. The police could not find an eye
witness to the stabbing, and have only
Black's word for it.

New York Money Market.
I NEW YORK, Jan. U.â Money on call, steady
CHICAGO. Jan. 12.â The provision market
was strong all day. Receipts at the yard were
under the estimate and prices up. At ad
vanced figures the demand was excellent from
all sources. At no time was there any pressure
to sell. Offerings were nearly all from profit
takers. May pork closed 10c over yesterday.
May lard 2%Â®5c up and May ribs 5c improved
over yesterday's final price.
. .The liberal Argentine shipments . and crop
conditions In that country were the main fac
tors In depressing wheat, that market barely
holding Its own. though It had strong corn and
provisions markets for near neighbors. The
decline at Liverpool In the face of the advance
here yesterday was a disappointment to . the
bulls and- encouraged selling. At one time a
little buying by shorts was caused by storlaa
Bradstreet' s on Trade.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â Bradstreet' s to-mor
row will ray: Quietness as to demand, but
marked steadiness as to prices, is still the
leading feature In trade lines, a condition, it
might be remarked, not uncommon â¢at this
stage of the year, which is a sort of middle
ground between stock- taking and Inventory
time and the actual opening of the spring sea
son.
Aggressive strength in . prices is confined to
a few staples, such as pork products, which are
firmly held on a rather tardy recognition of
Chicago Grain Market.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â The opening sales of
sugar afford convincing evidence that its
friends had rallied to its support and were
prepared to contest the progress which the
b^ars have made in cutting down its price.
Very heavy blocks were thrown upon the mar
ket at the opening, but the quotation was
lifted from 113 to 114 on running eales in the
first transactions of the day. The opening
price was the lowest. After the Etock got
above last night's level the bears renewed their
effort* to depress it again, but without suc
e*Â»s. The resistance shown by the etock caused
uneasiness in the ranks of the unwieldy sup
port and they started to cover. They carried
the 6tock up to 118. near which it closed.
There were no further signs of the acute weak
ness which was shown yesterday by the local
traction stocks and Tobacco, which was eaid
to be due to the closing out of an embarrassed
account. Those stocks were under pressure
during the morning, but they responded to
the recovery in Sugar and late general strength
in the market and rose vigorously above last
night's level. The pressure on Sugar played
no small part in the general strength of the
market. Railroads advanced at the opening
in sympathy with strength abroad, but they
were nut embarrassed by demoralization in
Â»;.â¢â¢Â¦â¢Â¦.:. '.: k-8 and so grained strength as the day
prosreits^d. All the principal stocks rose from
1 to 2 points over last nlght'c level and closed
â¢trong at the top. Some very heavy blocks
of Baltimore and Ohio were taken on in the
late dealings by the circulating of rumors of
Â«.j)proaclilng dividend declarations. The mar
ket broadened out notably In the late dealings
on the improvement sentiment in foreign finan
cial fird'-s, and in expectation of a strong
barJc statement. The Bank of Germany fol
lowed the other European government banks
to-day by reducing its minimum discount rste
from 7 to 6 per cent and the rapid downward
course of private discount rates in London
pave confidence in etlll further reductions in
the bank rates. London also took a sanguine
view of the advantages of General Butter's
new position on the Tugela River. The buying
lor London account was euflicient to cause a
eharp brealc in sterling exchange rates all
around. Money was in abundant rupply and
rates for time loans shaded to 6 per cent on
railroad collateral. Call loans fell to 3 per
cent. Sub-treasury operations had yielded to
the banks $3,443,000 up to Thursday night. The
net gain of the banks on the regular export
movement with the Interior is ostlinated at
about tbe came amount. This dors not take
account of receipts by reirlstered mall, which
are reported to have been on a large scale.
From these amounts must be deducted last
Saturday"* gold exports as well as $1,000,000
in sold, which went to South America to-day.
The net gain on banks on all accounts is
floured at about $4,000,000.
The bond market continued dull, but was
â¢ iron*. Total sales, par value, $2,195,000.
Untied States Ss (registered) declined %, but
the 6s advanced % in the bid price.

NEW YORK. Jan. 12.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say:
Dullness characterized the stock market in
the early days of the week. There was a mani
fest lack of buying power, and commission
houses are relatively idle, the general tone of
the market being Indifferent and somewhat re
eembling what might be looked for in midsum
mer.
Prices, however, held well for a time, al
though the operations of the room traders wern
confined to a few specialties and revolved
largely around the question of dividends to be
declared last Tuesday on Louisville and Nash
ville and Federal Steel, though the market took
a favorable view of the, trunk line deals and
the acquisition of the Big Four and Lake Erie
and Western by the Vanderbllts. The relief of
the money market from the strain of prepara
tions for the January disbursements and the
large amount of money unlocked at that time,
of which a considerable portion is presumably
coming back into Wall street for investment,
neem to have failed to produce the expected ef
fect upon quotations. Money on call ruled easy,
a 6 per cent rate being generally quoted, while
bankers' balances declined on Friday to as low
as 3%Â®4 per cent. Time money is, however,
firmly held at 6 per cent, though some lenders
Fhow a disposition to relax their attitude to
the extent of putting out funds at the rate for
Blxty days, while borrowers are Indifferent and
inclined to wait for easier rates. The fall In
the fort-Ign money market, discount in London
being down to 4 per cent, and the reduction of
the Bank of England and Bank of France min
imum figures to 5 and 4 per cent, respectively,
had a good effect, excepting in New York,
showing a tendency to decline, which negatived
the earlier assumption that some further
amounts of gold would be shipped.

London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The ma.rk.eta here were exceedingly quiet to
day. There was no pronounced buying any
where, but a cheerful tone pervaded all quar
ters. Induced by the reduction of the German
Bank rate from 7 to 6 per cent and the official
announcement that General Buller had seized
Potgieters Drift on the Tugela. A rise In con
eols of V 4 point was sympathetic of the Gen
eral feeling.
Americans were assisted here by a rumor
that a large Dutch operator who had been
an active buyer in mines and Americans had
closed his commitments and turned bull, pre
sumably on information from Boer 6ources.
New York Bales somewhat spoiled the effect
of this, but Baltimore and Ohio securities and
Louisville and Nashville remained In demand.
The Paris market wai firm in tone. The
Bank of England bought Â£65,000 in German
coin and another Â£100,000 was "ear-marked"
for the Indian currency. The Indian council
again raised the rate on telegraph transfers,
but there is no demand yet In India for bul-
SSoney remained easy at yesterday's rates,
but bills were hard. Foreign exchange rates
were quoted as follows: Paris, 22.22; Berlin.
24.4914.

AUCTION SALES
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 13, 1900.
the fact that supplier both of live bogs and
dead meats are far from burdensome. Tallow,
cottonseed oil and similar products are sym
pathetically strong. Raw and refined sugars
have both been avanced this week, not ap
parently because of the war between the re
finers being settled, but really because sup
plies of raw are limited. Quite a flurry in
coffee occurred as a result of reports of an
outbreak of the plague In Rio de Janeiro. The
bearish pressure in cotton has not been re
laxed this week, but the disproportion between
the decline in spots and options would seem
to point to the bear campaign having been
less profitable than hoi>ed lor.
What few lines of next season's woolen goods
have been reported are at advances ranging
from 25 to 35 per cent, and much interest at
taches to the reception that will be given these
Increased quotations. Pending the settlement
of this, raw wool In dull but firm, and specu
lation is naturally light.
â¢ Iron and steel are extremely quiet, but signs
of weakness are not numerous, the shading in
pigiron being confined to a few grades and
markets. Production in December was below
expectations, being affected by holiday shut
downs, but there Is little doubt that the aggre
gate production for 1899 will not be much be
low 13,700,000 tons, a production surpassing all
previous records, and having a counterpart in
the unexarooled output of coke also reported
for last year. Stocks of ore on Lake Erie are
reported little In excess of a year ago, notwith
standing the greatest production on record.
The quiet in pigiron extends practically to all
the finished branches of the trade, and hard
ware Is also quiet but none the less firm, as
evidenced by the reports of further advances
by Western Jobbers. Tin Is epeculatlyely
higher this week, but copper has sagged off.
The limited demand for lumber Is naturally
light, but the length of supplies Is notable.
as evidenced by the fact that white pine
stocks are 22 per cent smaller than a year ago.
The mild weather and lack of snow In the
Northwest If long continued Is thought likely
to effect the cut this winter. The large yellow
pins order for 10,000.000 feet for the Pan-Ameri
can Exposition at Buffalo, erroneously printed
10.000.000,000 feet last week, is still unplaced.
Cereals have been almost hopelessly dull this
week on the "hand to mouth" demand. Stocks
are- large and crop reports are In the main fa
vorable, but short sellers are nervous In view
of the possible foreign complications. Price
changes, not only in wheat but In corn and
other trains, are the smallest noted for many
weeks past. Hides are dull at the East, but
considerable buying Is reported West and quo
tations are fairly firm.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,248,926 bushels, against 2.609.
682 bushels last week. 6.647,081 bushels in the
corresponding week of 1899. 6.234,617 bushels in
IS9B, 3,948.154 bushels In 1597 and 3.202,124 bush
els In 189Â«.
Since Jnly 1 this season the exports of wheat
aggregate 110.742.805 bushels, against 134.036.048
bushels last year and 137.842.910 bushels In
1597-98.
The current week's failure returns reflect the
annual clearing out of delinquent traders In a
total for the week of 205, as compared with
229 last week, 304 In this week a year ago,
322 in IS9B, 478 in 1897 and 412 In IS9Â«.

NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â R. G. Dun & Co. 'a
Weekly Review of Trade will say In to-mor
row's Issue:
The business of the new year begins well,
though there Is still much of the usual hesita
tion. I In branches where last year's business
was extraordinary and prices have risen great
ly some pause Is natural, though nothing In
dicates decrease of consuming disposition or
purchasing power, but there Is a continuing
rise In wages to promote Increase. Monetary
conditions have grown easier with the return
of $4,000,000 from the interior during the week
and further deposits by the treasury and more
liquidation In some speculative stocks has also
helped. Banks report an Increase In their per
cent of commercial loans and rates were gen
erally more easy after the decline announced
by European banks.
The furnaces In blast January 1 were pro
ducing weekly 294,186 tons of pig Iron, against
296,959 December 1, but as several had stopped
only for the holidays and others had started
the optput now is probably larger than at
either date. It exceeds consumption at least,
as the Iron Age shows an Increase of 9256 tons
in unsold stocks, but the manufactures ap
parently consumed during the year 13,131.626
tons, less small net exports In December. The
increase since 1892 Is about 4,225,000 tons, or
46.5 per cent. Prices change scarcely any, nor
Is new business significant. The minor metals
are strong in tone, but as yet without much
change In prices.
Textile manufacturers are more fully em
ployed than for a long time, though scarcity
of water has troubled some cotton mills. Trad-
Ing Is embarrassed by uncertainty about prices.
Wool la not active, nor are speculators or
manufacturers In haste to buy at present
prices, though the goods market shows some
advances for the next season with excellent
trade thus far. The effect upon the season's
sales cannot yet be Judged. Cotton goods have
been quiet and no longer advance In prices as
the market for the material Is uncertain In
tone. The boot and shoe manufacturers have
a similar difficulty, for while shipments are
heavier, than ever before at this season. In
two weeks 173.376 cases, against 148,174 last
year, and 171,751 In 1898, as the rapid dis
tribution to consumers causes most urgent calls
for goods previously ordered, yet dealers are
slow to order more In the fear that prlceÂ»
will not hold. Manufacturers Insist that still
further advances are needed to cover the cost
of leather. The Chicago market for hides Is
weaker, with a lower average than at any
time since November 1. m
Cotton moves so slowly that belief in a very
Bhort crop Is' constantly strengthened, but for
eign demands are much reduced also. On
January 6 only 6,000.031 bale* had come Into
sight against 8.001.916 last year, but exports
had decreased 1,725,000 balea and European
stocks were far below last year. For the pres
ent foreigners are using up old stocks Instead
of buying more and the prlco hesitates.
Wheat has been slow to move also, Atlantic
exports In two weeks having been only 4.376,
614 bushels, flour included, against 9.45J.106 last
year and Pacific Coast exports 1.312,993, against
1.524.'051 last year. The prices close a fraction
1 Failures for the week have been 274 in the
United States, against 31S last year, and 25
In Canada, against 24 last year.
New York Grain and Produce.
BOSTON, Jan. 12.â The Commercial Bulletin
to-morrow will say of the wool market: The
market 1* flat and uninteresting. Not a sale
of washed Ohio wool or Australian has been
made this week. Cablegrams from Melbourne
note- a slight decline In cross-bred wools there.
The goods trade Is booming. Some overcoating
mills are Bold to September. Utah correspond
ents of Boston wool houses say that they have
received personal assurances from William
Jennings Bryan that If elected President he
will retain a protective duty on wool, having
changed his mind on free wool.
The sales for the week were 2,117,000 pounds
domestic and 130,000 foreign, a total of 2,247.000
for this week, against a total of 2,472.000 last
week and a total of 3,770,000 for the correspond
ing week last year. The receipts to date show
an increase of 6395 pounds domestic and a de
crease of 2417 foreign ajralnst last year.

STERLING STUCK
IN AN OIL TANK
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â Leland J. Ster
ling, a machinist employed at the West
Oakland railroad yards, underwent the
novel sensation yesterday afternoon of
being imprisoned in an oil tank for over
half an hour..
The tank was on a truck and Sterling,
who weighs 236 pounds, found that he was
comptlkd to lower himself into it in or
der to repair a leak in the bottom. By
n little squeezing he managed to get
through the manhole at the top, but it
vas more difficult to get out. He eetm^d
to have grown several inches while in
the tiink and. try as he would, he could
not reach the fresh air. After being in
side the tank for half an hour, his calls
for h*-'.T> attracted Oscar Lubbock. who
w^r.t to his aid. and. after much exer
llon, managed to extract his fellow em

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 12.
The Ebell Society handled two import
ant subjects at its meeting this after
noon when it first chose two delegates to
represent the organization at Los Angeles
on Tuesday of next week at the conven
tion for the discussion" of State federation
of women's clubs, and then took up the
subject of "Trusts."
After an ofllcial expression of regret
on the death of Mrs. Frederick Hall, Mrs.
George Bunnell moved that the Ebell So
ciety federate. This was seconded, and
after some little discussion of federation.
In which the majority of speakers declar
ed their ignorance of the subject and oth
ers were mildly for or against. Mrs. Fred
erick B. Ginn moved that Ebell, being
the. oldest woman's club in the State and
having been asked to have a representa
tive at Tuesday's convention, a delegate
be sent to Los Angeles to report on the
meeting there and that that delegate be
the presldent'of Ebell.
This motion was adopted, but most of
these voting for it said that they were not
yet ready for federation. It was then
decided to send two delegates. Mrs. F. B.
Gmn being chosen as the second.
In the general meeting that followed
"Trusts" was the subject. The living is
sue section, of which Mrs. Henry Vroo
man is chairman and Miss C. A. Whitney
is curator, had the programme in charge.
Mrs. Vrooman presided.
There were nine papers, each taking up
a different phase of the question, all to
the point and interesting. The speakers
were Mrs. Vrooman, Miss Whitney, Mrs.
Fred Allardt, Mrs. Chadbourne, Mrs.
Bunnell, Mrs. A. W. Bishop, Mrs. Milton
Bulkeley, Mrs. Louis Cockroft and Mrs.
Hndley.
Mrs. Cockroft's talk, which was a his
tory of the Standard Oil Company, was
one of the very uuccessful addresses of the
afternoon, and was roundly applauded. It
arraigned the trusts of the United States
as the great garnerers of gold to the detri
ment of the masses.
"No wonder, said Mrs. Cockroft. "that
the multi-milllonalrea at the head of the
great trusts are so concerned about the
souls of th:s unnumbered that they give
chapels and evangelist cars and universi
ties andâ .Â»brarles."
Mrs. Vrooman introduced the pro
gramme in a few general wonls on
"Trusts," after which Miss Whitney spoke
on the causes that led to the formation of
trupts, stating thei to be the changes in
the Industrial world through the invention
of machinery; the extension of railway
systems; the recognition of certain eco
nomic laws and the introduction of scien
tific methods in business.
Mrs. Allardt spoke on i..c present de
velopment of trusts. She showed their
increase and said that their promotion
had come to be a new Industry. The rail
roads, she declared, were the nestors of
all trusts. Mrs. Bunnell read a paper on
the convention on trusts held at Chicago.
Mrs. Bishop gave a practical talk on the
way trusts had affected commercial trav
elers. Mrs. Chadbourne's paper was
strongly anti-trust and In It she asserted
that the trust means the crushing of the
middleman In trade and that corruption
follows In the wake of great combina
tions.
Mrs. Bulkeley gave a historical sketch
of trusts from the Venetian consolidation
on salt five hundred years ago to the
present time. Her paper was not opposed
to trusts. She said that the trust was
the natural evolution, the centralization
of business. Mrs. Hadley gave her re
searches on trusts handled from a Eu
ropean standpoint.

*tll political clubs of Alameda requesting
each to select three delegates to a <-om
niittee conference to be held next Mon

Trustees to request them to defer the
iretholcers' election instead of fixing it
by ordinance for February 27.
The matter will bp considered by both
thÂ« Merchants' Exchange and the Board

bodies.
"I object," shouted Hopkins (Rep.) of
Illinois and several other Republicans.

lution be laid on the table.

Hopkins. "The able rer-ort of the Secre
tary of the Treasury has met all the
charges It contains."
Richardson (Dem.), the minority leader,
as a matter of privilege called attention
to what he claimed was an infraction ot
the rules of the House in the printing of
the sh'pplng bill. Appended to it was i
partisan argument by ex-Senator Ed
munds, which had no business here and
which made It a non-frankable docu
ment. He thought the whole document
should ' be suppressed.
Payne of New York explained that the
Edmunds argument had been printed by
inadvertence. After some discussion it
was agreed by unanimous consent that
the bill should be reprinted without the
argument attached in the. present print.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway. Jan. 12.
- Boring through the side of a house U
the latest method of operation adopted
by the burglars of Oakland. Last evening
they tried to effect an entrance into the
gun store of J. W. Orear at 517 Seventh
street by going through the side of the
house, but- It is believed that they were
frlghtf-ncd away by a setter dog that
sleeps in the store.
That the would-be burglars were ac
quainted with the premises is evident,
a.s they selected as their point of entrance
the only place where it would have been
possible to enter In that way. At every
other point there are rows of selves stored
with ammunition, which would have ef
fectually stopped their approach. The
place where they made the attempt is
protected only by the clapboard wall and
the recess in the shelving is occupied at
night by the dog that last night did
such effective work.
Next door to the gun store is a yard
used as a nursery and It is full of shrubs.
a fact which enabled the burglars to oper
ate unobserved. They used, in their oper
ations, a brace and bit, a chisel and a
saw and had cut out a hole about a foot
square before they were frightened away.
They left their tools and a sack, evi
dently to be used in carrying away their
plunder, beside the hole, when they took,
their hurried departure. Orear says he
never kept money In the store and It la
his opinion that the burglars were after
guns, ammunition and cutlery.
The attempted burglary was not dis
covered till daylight, but at-4 o'clock: this
morning Patrolmen Sherry and McSorley,
assisted by Deputy Constable Moffatt.
made the arreai of three suspects, who
are supposed to be not only responsible
for the attempted burglary, but for other
depredations which have been committed
recently in this city.
Â¦ Officer McSorley, In accordance with a
new plan of. patrol inaugurated by Chief
of Police Hodgkins, wad walking down
Clay street when he observed three men
at the corner of Sixth. When he waa ob
served the men walked hurriedly away
and broke into a run as he followed them.
He telephoned to Sergeant Clark for aid
and Sherry and Moffatt were sent to
assist him.
The three policemen overhauled the sus
pects at the free market on Clay street,
between Fourth and Fifth, where they
had taken refuge in a stall, and placed
them under arrest only after having
drawn their revolver's.
At the City Prison the men gave their
names as "\Villiam Dannaker, "William
Dowllng and James McCoy. The first two
have been through the reform school and
have served time for petty offenses. Mc-
Coy, while not known to the police. Is
thought to be an ex-convict. An effort
Is now being made by Chief Hodgklns
and his detectives to connect the men
with the recent burglaries and It Is said
that their description tallies exactly with
the "men who wounded "William Vincent
at Sixth and Clay streets, because he
refused to give them his cash.

FRUITVALE HOME
DESTROYED BY FIRE
OAKLAND, Jan. 12.â The home of Mrs.
James H. Harrold, at 1307 Monroe street,
between Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth
avenues, 'Fruitvale, was consumed by
flames at 6 o'clock this morning. The

been a defective flue.
The fire was discovered in time for the
family to save most of the furniture, but
the house is now in ashes. The damage
will amount to $2500, fully covered by in
surance. The Oakland Fire Department
was summoned to the flre and although
the house was outside the city limits sev

Doctors Disagree in
Mulder's Case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 12.
Harry Mulder, a Kentucky darky, has
thrown into a quandary two lunacy com
missioners. Insanity Warden James Page,
Superior Judge ,Ogden and District At
torney Allen. He was arrested for In
sanity at a very early hour this morning
and his examination this afternoon creat
ed a queer complication such as has never
before occurred in the history of Alameda
County's lunacy "commission.
Mulder is aged 21 years. He was found
roaming about on the mudflats at the
foot of Thirteenth street. He had di
vested himself of every stitch of clothing
and appeared in primitive undress. To
the arresting officers he said that he came
from Kentucky, that he had been wicked
and that, according to the Bible, the Lord
had told him to throw away all his earth
iy possessions. All he owned waa his
clothes and to do penance ho had thrown
his raiment into the bay. He was placed
in the insane ward at the Receiving Hos
pital and to-day Drs. J. C. S. Akerly and
E. T. Barber were selected as lunacy
commissioners to examine him.
To the commissioners Mulder said that
his actions were prompted by a desire to
be a good Christian and that he based
his beliefs on the Bible. He declared he
had a religion of his own which dictated
to him that nothing should come between
himself and the Lord.
"I thought I would sacrifice my
clothes," he said, "depending upon God to
reclothe me. But he has not yet done
so."
Then came the hitch. Dr. Akerly
promptly signed the recommendation for
the man's commitment to an asylum.
stating that the colored man was afflicted
with religious mania.
Dr. Barber, however, refused to so
recommend, declaring that Mulder was
not insane, but that he simply "misin
terpreted the Bible."
When Mulder was taken before Judge
Ogden his Honor declared he had no
jurisdiction and that he was powerless in
View of the doctors' failure 'to agree.
Insanity Warden Page next appealed to
the District Attorney for advice am 1 , was
informed that there exists no law cover
ing this kind of an emergency, but that
the matter rests with the warden, who
may keep the patient five days and have
him re-examined by other doctors.
Warden Page has concluded to hold
Mulder for a few days and then have him
re-examined. When asked this afternoon
whether he desired anything Mulder
asked only for the Bible.

PROPERTY GOBBLED
ON LAKE MERRITT
OAKLAND; Jan. 32.â The records of
the City Engineer's office in this
city are. not very complete as re
gards surveys of Lake Merritt, but
Incomplete as they are they show that
many acres of the most valuable land
have beon quietly appropriated by land
owners about the lake. Not alone is this
so, but Councilman Felton Taylor, who
made the original assertion that $75,000
worth of city land had been pre-empted
around the lake, says that houses now
stand where once rippled the waters of
Lake Merritt.
Lake Merritt was originally tidewater,'
and the time was when small schooners
used to sail up Into the arms where now
a rowboat can scarcely go. In order to
construct the main lake sewer, a very im
portant artery of Oakland's sanitary sys
tem, it wns necessary to make a lake out
of this arm of the bay for use as a flush
ing ba^in, and Congress ceded to the city
of Oakland all of its interest in Lake Mer
ritt. and it now ranks on the city records
as a water park.
The city of Oakland therefore holds
whatever title was held by the United
States, and that title is said to be from
the old Peralta grant line out. This Pe
ralta grant line was fixed by the United
States engineers and was intended to fol
low approximately the shore line. Shortl7
after Lake Merritt was created City En
gineer Arnold ran the official line of the
lake, which was Fubstantlally that of the
old Peralta grant line, and these two lines
constitute the official surveys of Lake
Merritt. In this investigation, as proposed
by Councilman Taylor, it will be neces
sary to re-establish these lines "and apply
them to the property surrounding the
lake, and this will show what land Is
claimed by the city find where there are
encroachments. It v.ill then be necessary
to establish title by search and probably
by suit.
l*y the most casual examination of the
rr.cp accompanying this article It will be
seen that on every side and corner of the
hike there have been encroachments,
statements to the contrary notwithstand
ing. The legality of these encroachments
will have to l>t- tested In some way or the
surface of Lake Merritt will be Rreutly
rtduced, and land that might be used by
the city for parks and a boulevard will be
diverted to private ownership.
These encroachments have mostly come
where small bays or bights have indented
the shores of the lake. These have been
filled either by the action of the elements
or by artificial means, and those owning
the adjacent property have taken posses
sion. There Is a considerable piece of
marsh land in the southwestern corner
of the lake, next the Twelfth street dam,
that is: outelde of the Peralta grant line
and the title to which Is in the Adams es
tate. This land is outside of the present
controversy, as it was submerged by the
creation of the lake, though this properly
Â¦would be very nice for the city to own.
When the boulevard was constructed
around the lake two arms were cut off
and filled. One of these has been taken
possession of by the Alameda Land Com
pany, which is owned by the Adams heirs
This contained fully half a square block
of land. The other has been taken pos
session of by Dr. E. H. Woolsey. and waÂ«?
much smaller.
The first step that will have to be taken
will be to make a complete survey of the
lake boundaries and then have a search
made to the title to the land Inside of the
line thus established. The settlement of
the title will then become a matter of law
and the courts. This is the plan advo
cated and initiated by Councilman Felton
Taylor, who rtrst sprung this question.
"I have not gone into this matter blind
ly." said Mr. Taylor to-night, "but gave
it a most thorough investigation before
making a move. Since IS7O I have lived
adjacent to the lake and know most all
the land that has been filled In and then
taken possession of by outsiders. A few
years ago the water extended up to
Franklin street. Now for several blocks
below that thoroughfare there is filled In
land, occupied by fine residences. I am
convinced that every foot of that real
estate belongs to the city and the pres
ent possessors are usurpers. It is the
same all arqynd the lake. Those people
who claim It nave no more right to it
than I would have to an island which I
might create by filling in a spot in the
middle of the lake. Every authority
which I have consulted Is of that opinion
and I think it Is about time thÂ« city
assorted its rights and instituted proceed
ings to recover D^ssess'nn of Its property."
ANGLUS' BULLET
MAY RECONCILE
SHARES FAMILY
Wounded Man Will
Recover.
OAKLAND. Jan. 12.â The f hooting of
Joseph liopor glares by Joseph Anglus
yesterday nt CectefTlUa has caused great
excitement In and about the town. A
great difference of opinion exists as to
whether the act was Justifiable or the mur
dennui <3tod of a madman. The wounded
man is not in a dar^erous; condition. The
bullet v.hich struck him entered the
breast, plarscod along one of the right tii>s
and lodged In the muscles of the back.
Soares will recover unless blood-poisoning
follows his injury-.
One of the results of the 'shooting Is the
probablo reunion of Soares and his wile.
<vho have been living apart for several
tears. As soon as she heard of the aJT-iir
tie harried to his bedside, and when she
â¢va* told that he would probably die she
Â¦went Into hysterics, and is now In a more
cr A, tlcaJ co:i<Jlti Â°n than her husband.
The Elsters of young Anglus seem to
Gioryin the murderous act of their broth
*T" .. ey ma<l e inmost Inhuman demon
strations in front of the Soares premise*.
.nduigir.g in indecent tirades against the
wounded man, tshoutlng so loudly that
their voices reached the sickroom and
creatly ar.noyed Soares.
"I never had anything to do with those
girls, he declared. "Never did I taunt
the boy about his sisters and he tells an
untruth when he says so."
Soares is contradicted by Ills daughter
Josie. who says thut her father"s relations
-.:t!i Minnie Anglus were the cause of
trie estrangement between him and his
wife.
"Papa seemed to be enraptured with
that girl." eald Miss Soares. referring to
Mir.r.ie Anglus.
"They went together in a clandestine
â¢way for a long ilme and when mamma
learned of It she left him. . Then he and
the woman quarreled and they have
fallen out and made up with each other
frequently during the past year. They
flr.ally became estranged about three
xaumhs ago and since then have not
Bpoken. He has frequently endeavored to
ofiect a reconciliation, but did not succeed
and Minnie has oftentimes warned him
to keep away from the Anglus residence "
"I'm sorry brother Joe didn't kill that
c.ld duffer." said Minnie Anglua this morn
ing, "and if 1 got half a chance Id kill
him myself. He's no good and ought to
be dead."
"Did you ever go with Mr. Soares?"
was asked.
"None of your business." was the reply
"What I do is nobody's affair." "
According to the statement of J M
Joeepn of CentervtHe. this is not the first
trouble of a similar nature in which the
Ang!u!= t-!s::ors have been involved. Jo- i
bepl! claims that he has been a victim of i
th>:r vengeance.
"They got a grudge apalnst me when !
we wt re all kids." he declared, "and long
after I h~<) grown up and had almost for- I
gotten thr-m they remembered it. One ',
night about three yours ago they sent â¢
word that they wanted to see me. When !
I called Minnie tackled me with the 1
sharpened prong of a pitchfork, while 1
Annie, pounced on me with an Icepick I 1
managed to make mv escape, but I've :
get a scar over my left eye yet."
Miss Anglus admits the" encounter with I
Joseph; and tells of It with considerable i
Batlsfactlon. I
The youthful assassin is still In Jail
and maintains his air of bravado. He i
declared that Soares slandered his sister j
nnd justifies his act on that ground He
waj visited this evening by a sister re- I
tiding in Sacramento. She claims to be
wealthy and will arrange for her brother's
defense.

Joubert's Huguenot Ancestors.
The occurrence of French names like
Joubert on the Boer side of the Transvaal

prominent. The descendants of many of
these Huguenots are found in the Trans-

their ways as the other Boers. vagsiasM

FEAR DROVE HER TO DEATH.
Mrs. Anderson, Wife of a Sea Cap
tain, Drank Carbolic Acid.
Mental anguish at the thought that her
husband might never return from a trip
to sea' caused Mrs. A. Anderson, resid
ing at 316 Twenty-eighth street, to take
her life yesterday by drinking carbolic
acid.
Captain John E. Anderson, the woman's
husband, is In command of the barken
tlne John Smith. Some time before Christ
mas he sailed for northern ports and his
return was long delayed. The hours of
suspense deranged the woman mentally,
but she recovered when her husband's
vessel sailed Into port Just before Christ
mas. Recently, however, Anderson Â¦ de
parted for another voyage to Ballard,
Wash., and anxiety for his safety again
preyed upon her reason.
Early yesterday morning the woman
arose and left . the house. ' Her absence
was not discovered until some time later,
when one Of her children awakened. A
search was instituted and she was found
on the top of the Noe street hill, writh
ing in pain. She had taken carbolic ncid.
Everything possible was done to save her
life, but she expired last evening about
7 o'clock. She was the mother of four
small children. Her husband was noti
fied of the sad case by wire.

FIRE COMMISSIONERS
PREPARING THEIR AX
Dougherty Re-elected Assistant Chief and

of the Department.
AT a special meeting of the new
Board of Fire Commissioners, hi'.J
yesterday afternoon at their apart

The programme, as arranged by Mayor
Phelan and his favorites, was carried out
without a hltcn. and the unanimity of ac
tion on the part of the Commissioners i
proved pretty clearly the charge preferred j
against the Mayor that every man he has j
placed on a commission was given the pÂ«j- i
Eitlon with the clear understanding that
he "stand in" on any old thing the heart
of the city executive might desire. â¢
The meeting was called to order by
President Watt at 5 o'clock, a full board
being present. Chief Sullivan was the only
person present except the secretary and a

William Waters, E. F. McKlttrirk. T. M.

The battalion chiefs were elected in the
order of their entering the department
and on recommendation of Chief Sullivan
were assigned for duty In the districts
over which they have recently had
charge. The districts of the fire wardens
were aW> arranged in deference to the
will of Chief Sullivan.
President Watt inquired the present
status of the department and was frank
ly Informed by the Chief that It was in a
most "d<-mora'.lzed condition" for various
reasons, the most important being the un
certainty of wbere the ax is to fall. That
the force Is to be largely depleted was
evidenced by the action of the Commis
sioners In preparing a number of blanks
to be sent the different foremen which the
firemen must fill out voluntarily. These
blanks are expected to furnish the data
required in relegating a number of the
force to the "waiting list."
Answers are required to the following:
Name ar.d residence; nativity; date of
naturalization, if foreign born; age; mar
ried or single; number of children; date
of entering the department; position in

U Chief Sullivan's interpretation of the
row charter regarding the salaries of
drivers of engines, wagons and trucks Is
causing a deal of "kicking" In i the de
l artmtnt, but will save the city thou
sands of dollars. The charter provides
â¢Lbst drivers shaJl b* nald Â£S0 for the nÂ»t
year. $90 for the second and $100 for tbe
third and succeeding years. The Chief
construes the charter as providing that
the service of the men begir.s with it 3
adoption and accordingly $10 has been
slashed off the salaries of all drivers.
It is contended that if the term of ser
vice begins with the adoption of the char
ter then this interpretation must also hold
good in the case of pensions, but Chief
Sullivan says such is not the case.
"Men are now drawing pensions who, if
such a construction were put upon the
charter, would cease to get any more
money," he said. "A man can be pen
sioned after he reaches the age of 65 and
the adoption of the new charter make 3

DONOVAN APPOINTED.
He Is Now Chief Deputy in Charge of
Street Bureau.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
appointed A. J. Donovan chief deputy in
charge of the Bureau of Streets at a sal
ary of $2400 a year. Donovan reported
that William H. Lame, a bricklayer in the
employ of the .Street Department, had
been discharged at the request of a com
mittee headed by M. Brandon, president
of the Bricklayers' Union, who eald that
Lame was objectionable to the union and
that all members employed on city work
would be ordered to quit If Lame were not
dismissed. Lame filed a communication
stating that he attributed his discharge
to the fact that he owed two members of
the union. $100 and was willing to pay It
back at the rate of $1 a day if ne were re
instated. Action will be taken to-day.
The board decided that under the char
ter whenever a side sewer is to be con
structed the work of tearing up the street
and replacing it in its original condition
will be done under the supervision of an
Inspector appointed by tho board and by
laborers in the city's employ. Whenever
such work is to be done it will be neces
sary for the applicant to deposit a sum
equal to the estimated cost as ascertained
by the board.
Colonel Mendell called attention to tho
Dr. Heintz to Dr. McGettigan.
Dr. C. D. McGettigan, who has been re

COMPLAINT BEING PREPARED
WILLIAMSON AND GAGE CLOSE
THEIR CONTROVERSY.
Notwithstanding the "cold feet" of Dr.
Barbat and those of Dr. Payne, ex-Health
Officer William P. Lawlor has determined
to contest In the courts the right of the
new Board of Health to its office. Dr.
Lawlor has been assisted in arriving at
this conclusion by Dr. W. B. Coffey, ex-
Secretary Edgar Carroll and former Quar
antine Officer Cohen. Just what are the
grounds upon which he will base his ac
tion he declines to state,' but It is likely
that he will seek to compel the board to
re-establish the local quarantine service
which it abolished at its last meeting.
Dr.- Lawlor holds, as does Mr. Carroll,
that the quarantine service Is essentially
a State institution and that the charter
and present board have .no Jurisdiction
over it, and it is said he will set forth
that contention in his complaint, relying
upon It to bring out sufficient legal lore
to determine whether or not the Health
Board Itself is a State organization.
On Thursday afternoon Mr. â¢ Carroll
called upon Health Officer A. P. O'Brien
at the City Hall and informed him that
the old board denied the right of the new
to interfere in quarantine matters, and
since that time the new officials have been
in a quandary as to what to do with the
quarantine tug and the handsome office
furniture with which the harbor head
quarters was fitted up. They had intend
ed moving everything except the boat to
the City Hall for their own use, but upon
Carroll s notification they changed their
minds.
Governor Gage has been In conference
during the past few days with Dr. J. M.
Williamson as to what disposition to
make of the quarantine tug. Half a dozen
propositions were made, among them to
provide the craft with a. permanent berth
at the seawall, beach ' her somewhere
along Oakland Creek and take her up the
river to Sacramento, but none of the sug
gestions made proved satisfactory. The
doctor and the Governor got together
again yesterday, and Gage finally referred
the whole matter to Attorney George A.
Knight, who suggested that the tug be
turned over to the Harbor. Commission to
be used and cared for by that organiza
tion: That suited Dr. Williamson, and to
day Mr. Knight will confer with the Har
bor Commissioners to see if they will ac
cent the charge.
Â¦The twelve 'newly appointed .. assistant
police surgeons arrived at the health
rooms early, yesterday morning and' were
presented with their official appointments.
They then' proceeded to draw lots to sec
which slx> of them should serve the first
six months and which the next. Owing to
a shortage of funds only six may. serve
at a time, so that the $100 Balary attached
to the position means in reality but $50.
As there are to be a number of changes
made In the drawing it was impossible to
g.et an accurate list of those who will
serve. The names will, however, be an
nounced at the next regular meeting of
the board.
the project. The following dispatch re
futes the statement:
MILWAUKEE, Wls., Jan. 12.â Gustav
G. Pabst, first vice president of the Pabst
Brewing Company of this city, when
shown the dispatch from San Francisco
announcing the formation of a syndicate
of Eastern brewers in opposition to the
local field in that city, said that there was
absolutely not a word of truth in the re
port as far as the Pabst Brewing Com
pany was concerned. Mr. Pabst added
further that he had not heard nor did
he believe that any such combination was
projected. ." Â¦-;
SUPERVISORS DIVIDE
LOAVES AND FISHES
At a Dark Lantern Caucus They Follow
Phelan's Dictation and Hand Out Their
Office Patronage as He Directs.
UNDER lock and key, with th*
double protection of a cordon of
. special police and office deputies,
the Board of Supervisors last night
held another of its "dark lantern"
sessions. The Inquisitive public,
and It was largely represented, was com
pelled to cool its heels for two hours on
the flags of the City Hall corridors, and
after it was all over it transpired that
nothing really serious had happened â
nothing, in fact, that the board had any
reason to keep from those interested. â¢:"
The principal business of the caucus
was the distribution of the few loaves, and
fishes which were in the board's keeping,
and that proved a very simple matter, as
Mayor Phelan had already indicated to
whom they were to go. Any action
taken by the board was merely perfunc
tory and simply a ratification of thÂ«
Mayor's previous decision.
Upon the recommendation of the Fin
ance and Judiciary Committees, it was
decided to create four clerkships at a sal
ary of $150. and two others with a month
ly stipend of $125. One of the clerkships
existing under the old board was abol
ished. When it came to filling the place?
thus created the programme went through
with little in the way of opposition. There
were a few who declined to accept the
Mayor's dictation, and they kicked to such
effect that they finally forced an agree
ment that when Jt came to ratification In
open meeting no member should be bounj
by the caucus agreement.
As The Call stated would be the case.
John A. Russell was retained as chief
clerk and John A. Ryan as his assistant.
Mr. Russell's salary was fixed at $300 per
month and that of Mr. Ryan at $150.
Cyril Williams, formerly expert of the Fi
nance Committee, was made expert to tha
board at a salary of $175. The three were
placed In nomination by Supervisor Reed.
On motion of Supervisor Tobin. A. W.
Thompson was retained as a clerk at a
salary of $150. Then three of Mayor Phe
lan's bunch were put through for clerk
ships. They were John E. Behan. John
Lenihan and T. Donlan. Lenihan and
Donlan fell in for the two $125 salaries;
Behan won the higher figure. C. W. Me-
Kenna. one of the old force, was retained
as a clerk at a salary of $130. Captain
Anderson, another Phelan nominee, was
made sergeant at arms and awarded a
salary of $100 per month.
Supervisor Helms proposed the name of
Fred Elliott, the present assistant clerk,
but his â¢ nomination received no second.
The same fate awaited Harry Farquhar
son, who resigned from the office soma
months ago. Farquharson had a number
of friends on the board, but they wera
promptly turned down at the mention of
his name. Supervisor Curtis raised a
question as to the eligibility of Thomp
son to hold a clerkship. He said he had
been Informed that Mr. Thompson lived
in Alameda. and upon his suggestion tha
matter was referred to the Judiciary
Committee for Investigation.
Supervisor Reed wanted the board to
start right In buying public utilities, and
he had a resolution with him providing
that the Spring Valley Water Company
should be the first to be brought up. His
fellow members, however, considered tha
matter premature and consideration was
postponed Indefinitely.
dsco their nest. The Mayor of San Fran
cisco has bo decided, and the members of
the Police Commission have promised to
obey his orders. These are serious alle
gations, but they are called forth by what
is perhaps the most serious emergency in
the history of San Francisco. They are
grave charges, but The Call, recognizing
Its responsibility, Is prepared to prove
them. *
The Call Is prepared to prove that three
of the men upon the Police Commission
were forced to* pledge their votes for
Frederick L. Esola, alias Frederick Har
rington, for Chief of Police before they
received a guarantee of their own ap
pointment. The Call is prepared to prove
that Mayor Phelan's ltch'.ng ambition to
be United States Senator prompted him
to turn the Police Deportment . entirely
into the hands of certain influences in ex
change for the support of a certain news
paper in his Senatorial candidacy. The
Call is prepared to prove that the Mayor
himself, bound and helpless by this com
pact, did not know the names of the pres
ent Police Commission until they were
handed to him by the men who command
that Esola shall be Chief of Police.
The Call is prepared to prove that thl3
gigantic conspiracy to subvert the city's
most powerful engine of order and good
nor a suspicion of reproach against his
private character. He has labored In this
city to advance Its welfare, but he is
pledged to vote for. Frederick Lawren,ce
Esola, alias Frederick Harrington, for
Chief of Police and knows that Esola will
appoint Jules J. Callundan, alias Worth
ington, 'Chief of Detectives.
In obeying this pledge Mr. Thomas will
make himself the patron of gamblers,
thieves, criminals and social outcasts.
Does he wish to accept the responsibility?
In electing Esola Chief of Police Mr.
Thomas will place his official and approv
ing seal upon bribery and blackmail. He
will give dreaded legality to dives and
dens of gross vice. He will establish
gambling dens upon a plane of recognized
Industry. He will bring to the doors of
his own home and to thousands of other
homes the contaminating breath of evil.
Does he think that his pledge Is worth
the price?
When he Is asked for whom he has
voted for Chief of Police and Chief of De
tectives Is he willing to admit the truth
and say two men with aliases? In de
scribing the virtues of the Chief of De
tectives will Mr. Thomas be ready to say
that the Chief of Detectives of San Fran
cisco is a man who robbed his employer,
attempted to place his guilt upon an in-
have been Police Commissioners. Both
know the tremendous powers for evil of
the Chief of Police. Both are interested
in ventures that bring moral 111 health,
crime, misery, dishonor and death to the
city. Both, therefore," are vitally Inter
ested to advance their own fortunes, to
protect the operations of those that prey
upon society and to Insure what Gunst
attempted when he was a Commissioner
of Police â a wider open town.
This Is the conspiracy that menaces the
people of San Francisco. It is the plot
that will not only place the law-abiding
citizens of San Francisco at the mercy of
criminal elements, but It will ramify until
Its influences are at the doors of every
decent home. Instead of blotting out the
moral plague spots of the town. It will
breed new one?. Instead of killing the
agencies of gross vice that smear the
public thoroughfares, It will place them
under police protection. Instead of guard
ing the young and inexperienced from the
snares of gamblers, It will plant gamb
ling.devices at every turn. This is Mayor
Phelan's first gift to new San Francisco.
And the donating agents are the mem
bers of the new Police Commission. Wil
liam Thomas, Police Commissioner, Is a
lawyer of reputation In this city. There
is not a stain upon his professional honor
government Into a machine of blackmail
and crime and disorder goes even still fur
ther. This paper is ready to prove that
Frederick L. Esola, alias Harrington, Is
boasting upon the streets that his elec
tion as Chief of Police was assured when
the ballots had been counted for Mayor
Phelan. Esola Is boasting that the elec
tion of a Chief of Police will be a mere
formality to give legality to his commis
sion.
This paper Is prepared to prove that
Frederick L. Esola, alias Harrington, has
already chosen his chief of detectives and
that his choice Is Jules J. Callundan, alias
Worthington, thief, defaulter and once a
fugitive from the justice of the employer
he had robbed. This paper is prepared
to prove that as an incident to the con
spiracy Callundan was smuggled into the
department and awaits now only the cul
mination of the plot that shall raise him
from the position of a peculating employe
to the tremendous control of an engine
that may be one of unlimited blackmail
and crime.
Conspiracies of such magnitude neces
sarily bring about strange associations.
Leagued In the effort to secure Esola's
election are Mose Gunst, gambler,
and Dan Burns, embezzler, discredited of
ficial and fugitive. Both of these men

nocent man and then "fled under an as
sumed name to escape Justice? If Mr.
Thomas is willing to do all this and more
that will shame an honorable man then
he will keep his, pledge.
Wllllam J. Biggy. Police Commissioner,
Is prominently in the public eye at pres
ent. He has nothing in his public life to
regret. As State Senator and as Registrar
of Voters he Justified a tribute for his
honesty of purpose and action. As acting
Chief of Police he is stirring the foul
spots of the town until the stench afflicts
the nostrils of decent men. He Is pledged
by his promise to vote for Frederick Law
rence Esola, alias Harrington, not only
to undo what he has begun, but to cover
the blight with the mantle of police pro
tection. Does Mr. Biggy enjoy the pros
pect?
Does he wish to establish a chain that
can be held together only by bribery?
When Mr. Biggy was In the State Senate
he startled the State by publicly denounc
ing an officer on a charge of corruption.
Does Mr. Biggy wish now to Inaugurate
a system of corruption that will feed upon
crime? He Is thoroughly informed of the
situation. Does he consider his pledge
more sacred than his honor? Is he. willing
to permit another to pledge away what
he has striven, through a long public ca-

to legalize vice and corruption, to throw
the town open to gamblers, thieves,

The compact was made before election; It
Is to be carried into effect now. It v.lll
b<? concluded when Police Lieutenant
I'rederick L. Esola is elected Chief of Po

established In the City Hall to prey upon
the people of the city, good and evil alike.
The very center of government will be a

thievery, to protect blacklegs and to In

The Police Department of this city, by
Â¦LBlborlty of the Mayor and the Police
Commission, is to be transformed Into a
gigantic thieves' fence. Its tremendous
powers are to be used not to suppress vices
and corruption, but to encourage, protect
and nurse them, that blackmail may be
levied upon them. The dens of Chinatown
and the lawless gambling of Chinese are
not to be wiped out, but are to be agencies

The dives that insolently flaunt their
pruriency and Indecency before the senses

MAXWELL'S PETITION DENIED.
May Proceed Against Fire Commis
sioners in the Superior Court.
The application of George Maxwell to
the Supreme Court for a writ of man
date to compel the Board of Fire" Com
missioners to reinstate him as secretary
of that commission has tailed. Maxwell
was ousted by the new officials of that
department to make room for Joseph C.
Gorman, whom Mayor Phelan had prom
ised to seat In the oClce held by Maxwell.
The latter decided to contest the appoint
ment, feeling particularly aggrieved at
the Mayor, for whom he had worked In
the recent campaign and from whom he
expected to receive a reappointment to
his old. position. When Maxwell tooktha
case to the Supreme Court ne did not re
cite that there were any political ob.iga
ttons that had not tyen fulfilled to nls
benefit, but dealt with legal points alone
His contention was that under the new
charter the Commissioners had the power
to elevate or derate members of the de
partment, or to remove officers and mem
bers from one position to one of a similar
grade, but to "fire bodily" never without
cause or trial. Hence the petition to man
damus the board to reseat him. His rea
son for applying to the Supreme Court
so he stated, was that the urgency of
the case demanded Immediate and final
action. Chief Justice Beatty called his
associates together yesterday morning
and they concluded that Maxwell had
made a mistake In filing the original pro
ceeding in the higher court, and the order
of the court was. "Petition denied with
