victory over the British troops at Modder

that he Is holding all his positions and
that the Boer cordon Is around Klmberlay

that an attempt is likely to be made by

soon, by holding out a threat of a Dutch
rising in the colony.

No Agreement Entered Into
With Germany as to War
in South Africa.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â 1n view of the persistent circulation of the
rumor that the Government of the United States has reached an agree
ment with the German Government, through Its representative. Baron
yon Holleben. to intervene between the combatants in South Africa,
the Associated- Press has secured from the highest authority a state
ment of the present position of the Government in this matter. This is to the
effect that there has been- absolutely no agreement reached between Secretary
Hay and Baron yon Holleben on the subject, nor has there been any discus
sion of the propriety of Joint mediation between the British and the Boers. Nor
has the United States Government undertaken or contemplated any Interven
tion on its own account. There has been no time, before or since thÂ« outbreak
of the present war. that the President would not have, with the greatest
readiness, exercised his good offices in favor of peace if that could have been ac
complished without what he regarded as an unwarrantable breach of interna
tional law and the proprieties. Hl* present position is said to be precisely as
stated in the following sentence, extracted from his annual message to Con
gress:
"We have remained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliance*
as to affairs not of our concern. Had circumstances suggested that the parties
to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression of the hope of the
American people that war might be averted, good offices would have been
gladly tendered."
It will be noted that the keynote of the President's statement may be found
in the plural, form he uses; the invitation to mediate must come from botli
parties; a single invitation is not a sufficient warrant for Interference In bis
' view. - * . . â¢
Belief Even in London That
Cronje Has Been More Suc
cessful Than Pursuers.
LONDON. Feb. 22. 4a. m.â Lord Roberts' list of forty-nine killed and wound
ed officers, including two generals, in the engagements up to Sunday even
ing causes anxiety, especially as in the officers' list neither the losses of the
Welsh and Essex' regiments nor those of the Mounted Infantry are includ
ed. This is about the number that fell at Colenso, where the non-commis
eio&ed officers and men brought the total losses to SOO.
It is considered strange that when tending his casualties Lord Roberts gives
no information as to the result of the fighting. If he cent such a report the War
Office is withholding it. Moreover, nothing Is known as to what took place on
Monday. Tuesday and yesterday. The absence of details from Lord Roberts 1 dis
patch, contrasted with his rather full narratives during the first part of his op
erations, produces uneasiness among military observers.
All the comment In the morning newspapers, both editorial and critical, is
threaded with the disturbing suggestion that despite hard fighting General
Cronje has been able to beat off his pursuers, has escaped and is being reinforced
by rail from Ladysmith and by forces on foot and horseback from Northern Cape
Colony as well as the late beleaguered of Klmberley.
As the correspondents with Lord Roberta are silent the telegrams from Boer
sources receive some countenance. The latter aver that Cronje, while the British
were endeavoring to surround him between Paardeberg and Koodosrand. re
ceived reinforcements under De Wet and that together the Boer commanders
fought the British to a standstill. .
However all this may be, public opinion here will not be reassured until the
War Office issues' explicit statements of successes, which, of course, would clear
away the gathering doubts respecting the uninterrupted success of Lord Roberta*
forward movement.
No one doubts his ultimate success, but there is a fear of temporary disap
pointment and that a lot of hard fighting is yet ahead of the British.
The latest report regarding General Buller circulated in the House of Com
mons last evening was that an agent of the De Beers Company had received a
cablegram from Cape Town, which must have passed the censor, to the effect
that General Barton's Fusilier Brigade had reached the hills commanding Lady
emith. Quite apart from this, however, and from every other rumor, the early
relief of the beleaguered garrison Is thought inevitable.

"My former husband was arrested, and

MRS. NEWHALL SUED
FOR COSTLY JEWELRY
Special Dispatch to Tbe CalL
SAN JOSE, Feb. ' 21.â There appears to
be no end to the troubles among the vari
ous members of the family of the late
Sylvester Newhall, which commenced
with the death of the latter several years
ago. To-day another action was com
menced by Mrs. Beesle Hawley. a daugh
ter, against her stepmother. Mrs. Mary
E. NewhalL
This suit, with the suit filed against J.
Nathan and wife, shows that Mrs. Haw
ley, who until a few years ago was a so
ciety belle of San Jose, made many per
sonal sacrifices of valuable Jewelry and
wearing apparel while with the other
children she waged a contest with her
stepmother for a share of the several
hundred thousand dollars left by her
father. At the death of Sylvester New
hall the children discovered that Mrs.
Newhall held deeds to most all the prop
erty. A contest to have the deeds set
aside on the ground of unsoundness of
mind and . undue Influence was com
menced, and was only a few months ago
compromised.
Now trouble has again arisen and to
day Mrs.- Hawley sued Mrs. Mary E. New
hall for a lot of Jewelry valued at $247;.
and for $1000 damage for tb^ detention of
the same. The complaint recites that
plaintiff was in possession of the articles
on October 21, 1&93, but since then her
stepmother has refused to give them to
her, thus greatly annoying and harassing
plaintiff. The Jewelry in question is a
gold watch, a cluster diamond ring, a sollr
talre diamond ring, a nine-stone diamond
ring, a cluster ruby and diamond ring, a
largeemerald ring and a white stone dia
mond ring. . . . .-
In the suit brought against J. Nathan
and wife, also filed to-day. Mrs.' Hawley
seeks possession of a promissory note
valued at $4SO. executed by her brother.

the return of the following wearing ap
parel: A silk mohair dress skirt, a black

the value of the wearing apparel at $350.
and. declares defendants have refused to
surrender the same and appropriated the
fame to their own use. In all Mrs. Haw
ley wants $S2O, or the surrender of. the
note and wearing apparel.

PROPOSED CHANGES
IN SHIPPING BILL
Number of Amendments Made In
a Substitute Submitted to
tbe House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. TLâTvot of thÂ«
Republican members of the House Ccra
> mlttee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries,
who have differed from their associates on
the terms of the shipping bill, to-day com
pleted a sub-bill, which was Introduced by
Representative Minor of Wisconsin, those
acquiescing with him in the measure be
ing Stevens of Minnesota. Jones of Wash
ington and Fordney of Michigan. The
bill follows the general plan of the orig
inal, but makes a number of amendments.
The most important or these, summed up
by Stevens and Minor, are:
The period of the subsidy is limited so
that vessels built since January 1. 1900,
shall have subsidy for twenty years, with
full rate for the first ten years and a '
slight decrease for the remaining ten I
years. Vessels built before January 1. WO. !
have the full subsidy for ten years. The I
original bill fixes twenty years as the pc- I
riod of subsidy.
The sub-bill provides that vessels oat
ward bound shall carry a cargo agprejrat- j
ing one-half of the tonnage for
which they draw compensation, cxaking
allowance of space for tonnage, bo. that
perishable goods and li^ht manufactured
goods shall be regulated by space. Instead I
of weight. Reductions for passenger and
mail space on passencer steamers are
made, in order to ascertain cargo ca
pacity.
Another change places all vessels built 1
abroad on the same basis In respect to ]
compensation. Instead of classifying them. :
In determining compensation the test for
speed Is Increased from four to six hours
with average speed for that time. There
is a prohibition against payment of com
pensation to any vessel peculiarly con
structed for transportation of mineral oils
only.
As a means of eliminating old and un
serviceable vessels, provision Is made that i
all vessels receiving compensation shall Â¦
receive and maintain the highest classl- j
fication in the Lloyds or some standard :
register. There Is a provision for the ad- ',
mission to American reprlstry of all ships i
purchased abroad by the United States :
during the war with Spain, and now under Â¦
the American flag. It Is provided that '
there shall be an Inspection and classifica
tion of vessels needed for Government
purposes, and an approval of naval offi
cers. Such vessels shall not be sold out
side of the United States without consent
from the Government.
HE LATE DR LESLIE E. KEELEY OF GOLD CURE FAME
LOS ANGELES. Feb. 2Lâ Dr. Leslie
E. Keeley, the Inventor of the Kee
ley cure- for the liquor habit, died
at his home on Adams street, in this
city at 7 o'clock this morning of
heart disease. He had been 111 with
a severe cold for two days, but nothing
serious was feared from it. Early this
morning, while going to his bathroom,
he had an attack of heart failure, but re
covered and later said there was nothing
Berious the matter with him. Dr. West
Hughes, a specialist In heart diseases,
was called, but,before he reached the resi
dence Mr. Keeley had had a second at
tack, and he died at 7 o'clock. There were
with him his wife and Judge Ewing, the
noted Christian Scientist of Chicago, who
has been stopping at the Keeley home for
several days.
The body will ultimately be taken to
Dwlght for interment, but as yet no ar
rangements for the funeral nave been
made. Mr. Keeley has been in Southern
California two winters.
Mr.- Keeley was 63 years of age. HÂ»
leaves a widow, but no children. Â¦ ThÂ»
only heir to his estate, besides his widow.
Is his sister, who lives at Dwight,' 111.,
Mr. Keeley's former home. The estate
is valued at $1,000,000.
Dr. Leslie E. Keeley's early years were
spent in St. Lawrence County, New York.
He went through the civil war as an
army surgeon and then settled down to
the practice of medicine In the .little
town of Dwight, 111. Thereby he rescued
it from obscurity.
It has been said of Dwight that more
drunkards have entered it and fewer have
departed from It than any other place
on the globe.
For many years he was as little known
to the outside world as the village Itself.
According to his own story, he devoted
all his energies to the study of drunken
ness as a disease â he said he was the first
man to so regard it, and even In Dwlght
found no lack of material.
I After many experiments he reached. In
ISTB, the conclusion that gold as a chloride
is a positive cure for alcoholism and that
the same base, with a change of men
struum, is also a cure for the opium habit.
Two years later he started an institute In
Dwlght for the cure of inebriates that has
since become world-famous as the mecca
of dipsomaniacs. The results he ob
tained by his treatment did not entirely
satisfy him. In ISS6 he shut up his insti
tute that he might devote his entire time
to experimenting for better results.
After eighteen months he again opened
its doors, at which time he added the hy
podermic treatment, which haa since be
come a distinctive feature of the cure.
Patients began to flock to him. Contro
versies raged about his cure. Many physl
i clans scoffed at It. But the remarkable
faith -In him shown by large majority of
those - who had taken his cure soon
brought about a change in public opin
ion concerning him, and he became an
object of respectful professional consider
ation, notwithstanding that his treatment
was In part secret, in violation of the code
of medical ethics.
â¢ "Graduates" of hla institute formed a
Keeley Association and held reunions pub
licly, proclaiming to the world their vic
tories over the demon .of intemperance
through the gold cure. Some famous men
were among them. Branch Institutions
were established and the member* In
creased rapidly over the country. It long
since became apparent that in the gold
cure Dr. Keeley had struck a gold mine.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â
War between Costa Rica and Nicaragua
Is regarded as Inevitable as a result of
the dispatch of a revolutionary expedition
of invasion from the latter country Into
the territory of the former republic. Con
cerning the situation Minister Merry, ac
credited to the two governments as dip
lomatic representative of the United
States, haa wired to Secretary Hay to this
effect:
"Revolutionary Invasion expected from
Nicaragua. Martial law declared. Troops
moving to the frontier."
No request was made by Minister Merry j
for a man-of-war and the State Depart- j
menf consequently has not requested the I
Navy Department to cable Instructions to '
Rear Admiral Farquahar directing him I
to proceed or Bend a vessel to Nicaragua. 1
It Is likely that the Ranger, which la at j
Panama, will be ordered to proceed to \
Brito or to some point in close comaiuni- Â¦
cation with the capitals of Nicaragua and j
Costa Rica, so as to take such measures
for the protection of American interests
as may seem desirable.
Would Preserve Peace.
The efforts of this Government, which
is peculiarly interested in preserving the
peace of the two republics, will be di
rected toward averting hostilities. In this
connection it is recalled that just before
the war with Spain there was grave dan
ger of war between Nicaragua and Costa
Rica and revolutionary expeditions were j
fitting out in Nicaragua to invade the j
neighboring republic, but by diplomatic I
negotiations Minister Merry and Captain j
L*"Utz, who then commanded the Alert,
eucceeded in inducing representatives of !
the two republics to sisrn an agreement ]
on board ship which brouzht a close to '
the controversy. It is hoped by the offl- i
clals that Minister Merry will take such
steps as may seem necessary to preserve
the peace.
The authorities are particularly Inter
ested at this time in the maintenance of
the present government in Costa Rica.
President Iglesias has expressed his ap
proval of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty and
in order to prevent complications In tha
construction of the canal has declined to
make any concessions respecting tha
canal to private corporation.

KANSAS CITY HAY
GET THE CONVENTION
6pÂ«clsJ Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2Lâ On the eve of
the meeting of the National Democratic
Committee, which assembles here to-mor
row to fix the time and place for holding
the Democratic National Convention.
Kansas City and Milwaukee are strug
gling earnestly for the honor of entertain
ing the convention. Although there ia
some desultory talk of Cincinnati as a
compromise, the fight is between Milwau
kee and the metropolis of the Southwest,
with the chances to-night seemingly in
favor of the latter place. Milwaukee has
raised a fund of $100,000 for the entertain
ment of the convention. The amount
which Kansas City is expected to expend
has not been disclosed.
Senator Jones, chairman of the commit
tee, is holding aloof from the fight and not
throwing the weight of his influence either
way. The Milwaukee boomers are mak
ing much of the political effect of holding
the convention In Wisconsin for Its effect
upon the Germans, who, they assert are
disposed to be hostile to the administra
tion's expansion policy.
After counting noses to-night. Kansas
City claims a clear majority of the votes,
but the Milwaukee contingent was equally
certain that it had a majority. The con
sensus of opinion Is that the convention
will be held before the Republican con
vention, early In June or the latter part of
May.

LONDON. Feb. 22.â A great battle' has
been raging along the line .of Modder

Roberts has been pitted against the
strategy of Cronje. No official details of

but official messages published In Pre

and Kitchener and correspondents who

MAIL NOT OPENED
AND NO SECRET TREATY
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â The answer
of the State Department to the House
resolution calling for information regard
ing certain charges made by the late Con
sul Macrum was transmitted to the Hocea
to-day by the President. It is signed by
Secretary Hay and, after reciting the res
olution, say*:
Answering the first part of the resolution:
The Department of State haa been In reffirtar
communication by mail and telegraph with
Cbarles E. Macrum. late Consul of the United
States at Pretoria. South African P^pab'.lc
t'.noa hla entrance opon the duties of the office.
Comssanleatlona made to him have been an
awered and the ezeootioa of instructions aent
has beea reported by him. Bla dispatches to
the department were forwarded through the
CoE*nlate at LoOrenxo Martjnea. and bare, dur
ing- that time, been regnlarty Â¦ received. The
only Instance 'of complaint In respect to the
tranalt of malls for Licurenzo* Marques and
Pretoria was In Kovesaber la*t, when a tÂ«m
'poray stoppage of the mails occurred at Cape
Town, against which Mr. Macrum and thÂ«
Ccr.su! at Lourenzo Marsues protested. Ar
rangements wens made for the prompt delivery
of the Consular mails to the United States
Consul al Caoe Colony, by whom the mail for
Mr. HouJa and. Mr. Macrum was forwarded to
Lourenso Marauas. Tee delay lasted but a
few days asd baa not recurred, so far aa the
department Is advised. After that time the de
partment's mall for Lourenzo Marques and
Pretoria was sect by a neutral route, which it
appears was. known and open to Mr. Macrum
and Mr. Hollls as early as November 6 last.
No obstacle, therefore. Is known to have ex
isted alnoa then to Mr. Mac rum's unhampered
correspondence with the Department of State.
At no time while at his post did Mr. Macrum
report to the department any violation by open-
Ine or otherwise of his official mail by the
British censor at Durban or by any persons
or persons whatsoever, there or elsewhere.
Neither has he so reported since he left Pre
toria, although fcavlngr ample opportunity to do
; so by mall while on the way home or In per
i eon when be reaahed the department upon his
return home.
Answering the eeeond part of the aforesaid
resolution, tha undersigned, the Secretary of
.State, has the' honor to say. that there Is no
truth in the charge that a tecret alliance exists
between the republic of the United States and
the empire of Great Britain; that no form of
secret alliance is possible under the constitu
tion of the United States, inasmuch as treaties
require the adrice and consent of the Senate.
and. finally, that no secret alliance, convention,
arransement or understanding exists between
' the United Â£tatea and any other nation.

information received at the "War Depart

ent expedition of General Bates into tha
two provinces at the extreme Â¦outhÂ«nv
part of the Island of Luzon, military opÂ«-'
rations In the Philippines will close. JLf
terward, it is stated, there is nothing to
do but to undertake to maintain order
through a police system. Attention is
now being given to that subject and Btepsv
are being taken to form a thoroughly
mobile, lightly armed gendarmerie,
something on the order of the Canadian
mounted police, to cover the island at all
points and conserve the energies of the
regular troops.
The arrest of a Tagal on the chargra of,
being a guerrilla, as reported from Ma
nila yesterday. It is .said at the depart
ment, marked the initiation of another
policy toward the insurgents who still re
main under arms. As the summary pun
ishment of guerrillas cannot be had until
some action has been taken to declare the*
termination of th<Â» application of the rules
of war. it is assunVd at the War Depart
ment that General Otis has already Issued
some kind of a proclamation or notice to>
the natives, warning them that if they
defy the rules of war and pursue preda
tory warfare they will be treated as guer
rillas when captured.
Why Denby T>eclined.
The- President is devoting special atten
tion to the formation of the new Philip
pine commission, acting on the advlco
that the army has reached the end of its
functions in the islands and that the time
is ripe for the establishment of civil gov
ernment throughout the archipelago. It
is hoped that the personnel may be com
pleted before the end of next week. It
appears that Mr. Denby was obliged to>
decline reappointment as a commissioner
on account of physical Inability to stand
the hard work that will be involved
throughout the visit to all the islands and

Farmer?' Urged- to Study the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 21.â
The completion of the third day's lectures
to the fruit growers has proved that the
results accomplished will far exceed the
most sanguine hopes of those who
planned the convention. The morning
trains brought to Palo Alto a large num
ber of persons who are Interested In ques
tions pertaining to horticulture, and each
of the four lecturers was greeted by a
roomful of attentive and enthusiastic lis
teners.
The first speaker of the morning session
Â¦rt'as Vice President John C. Branner of
the geology department, who spoke upon
"The Soils of California." His remarks,
while technical in their nature, embodied
many ideas of practical value to the
fruit grower and gave* a general Idea a3
to what soils are best adapted to certain
kinds of fruits.
Nature Study.
The second speaker was Mrs. Anna B.
Comstock of Cornell University, who
spoke upon "The Relation of Nature
Study to Agriculture." â¢ .
â¢ "ffhe object of nature study," she said.
"is not to teach sciences to children, but
to keep awake the powers of observation
âthe ability to use their brains. The rea
son that the child tires you with questions
Is because he sees more things to ask
about than you do to answer. Their ques
tions axe often more to the point than
those cf their teachers."
Mrs. Comstock then traced the growth
of nature study from its rise In Cornell
during lSy2-W to its importance during the
present day, when it is taught In practi
cally all the schools In the state of New
York. It was found that in order to teach
agriculture to the children it was neces
sary that the child's training should be on
all eldes If It was to be of any service to
him.
"What we wish to accomplish In rela
tion to agriculture and horticulture," she
said, "is to teach the children that things
on the farm are a thousand times more
interesting than those found in the city,
and thereoy keep the brains on the farm.
The country child does not particularly
want to go to the city, and so soon as you
show him his opportunities on the farm
he will etay there. So recently as forty
years ago the farmer was the conserva
tive force that helped us In every national
emergency. To-day we Â«nd the untrained
and almost unentranchised foreigner on
the farm. We want to bring back the
farmer boyâ to so train him that every
furrow he turns, every bud he sees, will
tell its story to him. If we can keep our
best blood on the farm we need have no
fear. ,
The Old Farmer.
Prof. E. A. Ross, head of the dsoart
ment of economics and sociology, was thÂ»
first speaker at the afternoon session
taking as his theme "The Old Farmer and
the -New." He said that his recollections
of the old farmer dated back twenty-jlve
years to the time when he was a boy on
a farm. At that day the farmer practi
cally produced all those things which he
consumed. By means of exchanging with
his neighbors and practicing strict econ
omy he needed to buy but little. To-day
the condition of the farmer has changed.
He is now engaged in a commercial en
terprise, the raising of crops, all of which
he sells. So we hear nothing more of the
"surplus," for all Is surplus, so far as his
personal consumption is concerned.
"The farmer is now quite as much on a
cash basis as is the merchant. What he
produces he sells, and what he consumes
is bought in the market. The farmer who
buys 'patent flour' Instead of grinding hie
own grist Is no longer, scoffed at. It is
safe to say that every Industry that can
be carried on in the city is destined to
leave the farm. The prime factor of this
is. cheap transportation. This makes it
cheaper to send the raw product to the
city and have the work done there and
bring It back to the farm than to do the
work on the farm. The second factor la
cheap machinery, which every farmer
must buy if he Is to keep up with his
many competitors.
"The third reason is the rise of the
cities. This means the extension of mar
kets to the farm.
. "The old-time farmer had the Impres
sion that he was not competing with any
once. If he raised a short crop of sorghum
through carelessness the only result was
that he used less on his bread. To-day
the less he produces the less is his in
come. It is a universal law that when a
thing becomes customary it then becomes
necessary. . He must therefore keep pace
with his neighbors in Improving both his
machinery and methods. Certain fixed
costs must be met, and the margin above
this represents his net income. If he lags
far behind the standard set for him, lie
cannot live. In addition to all the ene
mies which the old farmer met, he has
also the new enemies which the advance
of civilization has forced upon him. The
men who stand between the farmer and
the consumer quite often are able to pick
his pocket. The price that the farmer will
get for his product depends upon the
ratio between the money and produce. If
he has Incurred a debt supposing that the
supply of dollars, will keep pace with the
demand for them, he places the money
lender in a place to pick his pocket. He
slakes his crop,s against the railroad, the
trust and the middleman, since he is
forced to play the game with them, and
his only salvation is to learn the rules of
the game. In other words, the farmer of
to-day must be a business man In addi
tion to being a scientist. If he cannot
keep up with the procession his ilnal
status must be that of a renter or day
laborer. There are no economic reasons
why the small farmer cannot succeed, but
he must thoroughly understand his busi
ness, else he will be swallowed up by the
large farmer.
"With the disappearance of free land
during the eighties an economic influence
that rad been with us ever since our
country was settled was eliminated. The
farmers have looked with some favor
toward the Philippines for the reason that
It would afford free land for their sons.
Could they realize the true economic and
climatic conditions of those Islands the
expansion movement would receive its
death blow. (Applause.) With the open
ing up of the Orient, the damming up of
population and the completion of the
Trans-Siberian railway the farmers of
California will have to bec,ome~ prodigal
with their labor and economical with
their land.
Professor O. P. Jenkins of the depart
ment of physiology was the last speaker
of the day. taking as his subject "Bees
and Fruit Growing."

IN A POLICE COURT
Actress Accused of Offending Pub
lic Morals in the Presentation
NE"W YORK. Feb. 21.-O!ga Ncther
sole, the actress, was a prisoner
in the Tooaabs Police Court this
afternoon, where she was ar
raigned on a charge of violating
the peaal code, which relates to matters
oJTer.Clng public morals.
The actress' latest play, "Sapho," now
running et Wallack's, was the cause cf
her arrest. With her were arraigned
Marcus Mayer, her manager, and Hamil
ton Revelle, leading man of her com
pany. Miss Nethersole was arrested at
the Hoffman House this afternoon by In
spector Thompson en a warrant Issued
this morning by Magistrate Mott. Mayer
and Revelle were taken into custody by
Detectives Cuff and McNaught. who
found them at the theater. Theodore
Moss, proprietor of the .theater, ; who is
included in the complaint, was 111 In bed.
The three prisoners were taken at
once to the Toombs Court. There they
â¢wpre met by their counsel. Abe Hummel.
They were at once arraigned before Mag
istrate Mott on a complaint made by the
District Attorney, who was represented
by his assistant. Daniel O'Reilly.
Mr. Hummel asked that the examina
tion be postponed until Friday morning
at 11 o'clock. Mr. O'Reilly consented. The
defendants were paroled in custody of
their counsel.
District Attorney Gardiner appeared
before Magistrate Mo\t in the Center
street Police Court this morning and ap
plied for warrants for the arrest of the
j>ersons responsible for the production of
"Sapho." Colonel Gardiner said that he
had Information which warranted him in
the belief that the play of "Sapho" waa
an immoral play and an offense against
public decency. Magistrate Mott told the
District Attorney that he would have to
draw up a formal complaint before he
would issue any warrants.
Offense Against Decency.
Colonel Gardiner then, with the assist
ance of Forbes Hennessy, drew up a
formal complaint, in which he said that
from the information furnished he was
led to believe that Olga Nethersole's pro
duction of "Sapho" was an offense
ag-alnst public decency and therefore
should be stopped. The complaint said
that a newspaper reporter informed the
District Attorney that on Tuesday night.
February 20, he visited Wallack's Theater
and witnessed a performance of "Sapho;"
that the theme of the play was the por
trayal of the life of a dissolute woman
"in a way to offend and shock the morals
and decency of the people of the city."
After half an hour's labor Colonel Gar
diner and his assistant finished the formal
wording of the complaint and presented it
to Magistrate Mott. 3
"That is strange." said Colonel Gar
diner, "I understood that one of the
grand jurymen had been to see 'Sapho*
and he was deeply shocked and had called
the matter to the attention of his fellow-
Jurymen yesterday morning. I thought
that they asked for a written report from
Police Inspector Thompson, who had gone
to see the play at the instigation of. his
chief. How about that. Mr. O'Reilly?"
Mr. O'Reilly Bald that there had been
some talk about the immorality of
"Sapho" in the grand jury room, but that
the matter had been dropped. Assistant
District Attorney O'Reilly said:
"I don't know about the Criminal Code,
but it was awful."

Loss Reported at the
Morgue.
Last evening three women from Oak
land'called at the Morgue and endeavored
to ascertain the whereabouts of James
Wald, the son of one of the most wealthy
woolen goods manufacturers in London,
EnglandT According to their story the
man had been in San Francisco for six
weeks, during which time he had only
been heard or once. Before leaving Oak
land young Wald made frequent threats
that he would commit suicide and inti
mated that he would Jump Into the bay.
His friends, learning that the body of a
man had been found neai%the Cliff House,
thought that it might possibly be that of
Wald and viewed the remains last night,
but found themselves in error.
Wald comes from one of the best fami
lies in England. He is an accomplished
musician, but Is unfortunately afflicted
with epilepsy. During his stay on the
coast his health has not been benefited
and he made up his mind to end his life.
BOXER COLE
WINS FROM
DE COURSEY
Latter Lands a Foul Blow Ac
cidentally in the Fourth
Round.
The boxing' bout between William Cole
and William de Coursey last night In the
arena' of the Columbia Athltjtio. Club
ended unexpectedly in the fourth round.
DeCoursey landed a left swing on Cole's
head. Cole then staggered De Coursey,
who came back at once and knocked Cole
to his knees. De Coursey followed up
his advantage and In â his Impetuosity
struck Cole a light blow in the face be
fore he removed his knee from. the floor.
As this is a foul under tho rules Referee
McGinley awarded the bout to Cole. He
was fortunate in this ending as had the
fight gone on it semed he must lose.
The trail of the sharpers who flx flghts
in order that they may rob the betting
public was again laid bare by Referee
McGinley when the boxers entered the
ring. He declared all bets off because
of the bad look of the fight. It was an
nounced that McGinley had been ap
proached repeatedly by men who offered
him money to decide the fight against
De Coursey, who, on form, figured a
strong favorite.
The death trap of a building In which
the fights of the Columbia Club are held
wsls as usual overcrowded. Many more
spectators were admitted than the place
should properly hold and the usual scenes
of confusion ensued when those in attend
ance all tried to make their way out by
the one small stairway whioh the build
ing supports.
The first bout, between William Condon
and William Perry, started quietly and
for three rounds there was hardly a blow
struck. In the fourth Condon woke up
first and landed two left swings on the
head, the most effective blows up to that
time. The remainder of the bout waa
all the most ardent follower of the ring
could desire. Condon resorted to jabbing
and before the end of the round had Perry
In trouble. Condon was the stronger in
the next round, but Perry evened the score
in the seventh. It was whirlwind fighting
in the last round, each man being In dif
ficulty at times. Condon was the stronger
throughout and was awarded the bout
on points by Referee McGinley. The de
cision was a' popular one. â¢Â¦
William Martin was given the decision
over "Jack" Dennis In their 10-round'
bout. Martin was the aggressor through
out the fight. Real fighting did not com
mence until the sixth roufta, in which
Dennis showed to good advantage. Mar
tin seemed to have fought himself out.
He went to his knees once
of a foul blow. It was palpably faked,' and
he was soon on- his feet. He then went
at Dennis viciously. In the midst of a
scrimmage Dennis landed a- hard left
hook, knocking Martin down. He took the
limit allowed and easily lasted the round
out. The seventh was a' fast round, Mar
tin knocking Dennis down. He followed
Dennis all over the ring, landing a shower
of blows, none of which proved effective.
The gong saved Dennis. Â» The eighth was
a repetition of the previous round. Mar
tin dazed Dennis with right and left early
In the round. He landed at will through
out the round, but none of the blows
proved effective. The ninth round was
slower, but the pace quickened In the last
round. DenniÃ lasted it out, but the de
cision properly went to Martin.

his "piece de resistance." It waa in the
nature of an exhibition of the art of self
defense as practiced by the Japanese and
K. Inoue and J. J. O'Brien of the Police
Department of Nagasaki exemplified the
art. Both men were evenly matched as
to size and weight and both appeared In
the arena minus shoes or stockings; the
upper portion of their bodies being pro
tected by stout canvas. Instead of the
wrestlers' mat they used woven matting.
Their work was as marvelous as it was
thrilling. They threw each other, choked
and wrestled and in a half-hour's work
proved what a weak man with a knowl
edge of the "game" could do with a
burly antagonist.
Medals won in the swimming and wrest

President Harrison and pinned on the
breasts of the victors by fair hands.

MAHONY'S SUCCESSOR
ON BOARD OF WORKS
The vacancy In the Board of Public
Works caused by the resignation of Jere
mlaii Mahony will be filled by the ap
pointment of Thomas R- Bannerman. The
Call ascertain* that Mayor Phelan. after
canvasfing the names suggested for his
considfei-auoa. has - resolvtad to offet the
commission to -Mr. Bannerman,'- The fchar
ter requires a commiEsipner on this board
to devote a grÂ«?at deal of time to the work
of the city. In fact, more time was re
quired than Mr. Mahcny could give.
When he accepted the appointment he did
fo reluctantly, as he had grave doubts
then whether he could give to the office
as much time &Â» the duties pertaining to
It would demand, but at the suggestion of
the Mayor he consented to fcerve for
awhile.
Thomas Bannerman Is regarded as a
capab'e and energetic man. He has a
practical knowledge of affairs cuch as the
commission Is bound to conduct. Mr. Ban
nerman la a well-known Irish Republican
and a prominent memlw of the Knights
of the feed Branch, lie has been associat
ed with large dry goods houses of the city
as bookkeeper and manager. His practical
knowledge of business affairs was so well
recognized that he was called In to resus
citate the declining: house of J. J. O'Brien
& Co. The call for his assistance came,
however, too late for any one to re-estab
lish the Institution on a prosperous basis
without large investment of new capital.

HORSEMAN OF
NOTE HERE
ON A VISIT
Henry Titer, Celebrated as a
Reinsmaiy Has a High
Opinion of Califor
' : nia Horses.^ V
Henry Titer, head trainer and race
driver for J. Malcom Forbes, the Boston
millionaire, who is deeply interested in
the breeding and development of trotters,
Is In this city. His trip is solely for pleas
ure, but his natural inclinations have led
him to visit the noted breeding farms and
training tracks on the coast. He spent
some days at Palo Alto and also at Aptos
Btock farm, the home of A- B. Spreckels'
trotting horses. Mr. Titer also saw the
Keating string, headed by Anaconda and
Klatawah, at Pleasanton track. He ad
mired greatly Mr. Griffiths' pacer Fitz
simmons, by Direct.
"Trotting horse Interests were never so
prosperous looking as they are at present,"
said Mr. Titeryesterday. "There will be big
money on the national circuit this year,
over $650,000 being hung up in prizes.
There are at least five stakes in which
$10,000 is hung up. These races will be In
variably of the three In five order, but
the purse races will be decided in best
two out of three heats. There is a great
deal of speedway driving in ' New York
and other cities, and this has stimulated
the demand for fast horses in a marked
manner. The New York speedway is
kept in as good condition as a first-class
track for trotters. That of Boston Is too
hard for the fastest work, and I should
say the speedway in Golden Gate Park
Is also kept a trifle too hard.
"The two-minute trotter? I can't see it
in sight yet; but I think some of the
pacers, especially Searchlight, will reach
that mark. I believe the greatest speed
should be attained by horses trained and
raced in California, because of the excep
tional opportunities offered for training
and racing throughout the year.
"Mr. Forbes' best horses on the circuit
last year were Binger 2:O6Vi and Peter the
Great 2:07^4. They will be campaigned
again this year, and each of them should
get a mark of 2:03. They are sound and
have good legs, as all horses must have
to stand the terrific strain to which they
are subjected in training and racing.
"Of the youngsters I have seen here
there are a number which will be heard
from. At Palo Alto there is a three-year
old mare called Gussuro, by Wildnut-
Sweetwater, she by Stamboul, which
shows herself to be of the highest class.
Mr. Spreckels Is particularly happy in the
results of his efforts at breeding the best.
A two-year-old colt by Cupld-Hulda Is
one of the best I have ever seen, and It
will be difficult to produce his equal Jn
looks and promise. I like him better than
any colt I ever saw at that age. The
suckling by Searchllght-Hulda should be
good, on blood lines, but all foals look
alike at that age and it Is all guesswork
to figure out what he will develop. Mr.
Spreckels also has two fillies three and
four years old â¢which show themselves to
be great Individuals. .All the Aptos horses
are sound, which is greatly In their
favor."
has dignified Itself with the cognomen of
a club. Nothing could be more erroneous
than such an Idea. The Walters' Club Is
a club In all that the word Implies, and
one of the most comfortable and best pro
vided for In the entire city at that.
Its present home is a large commodious
building, admirably suited for the use to
which It Is* put It contains about forty
rooms, â¢ which have been converted Into
apartments suitable for lounging rooms,
card rooms, billiard rooms, lunch and
reading rooms and, In fact, all the differ
ent divisions that are generally considered
Indispensable to the comfort of the man
who wishes to pass an afternoon or even
ing away from the discomfort of a family
circle.
. The club started about two years and a
half ago and hired one small room on
Third. street for Its first meeting. There
was then only enough money In the treas
ury to pay the rent of the room for a oou
ple of hours. The membership at that
time consisted of about twenty. To-day
the same organization has a membership
of over 800, a splendid home that is com
pletely furnished and appointed and which
is under no debt and a good healthy, bal
ance In the bank. This has all been done
on an initiation fee of $2 50 for each mem
ber and monthly dues of 50 cents.
The officers of the club who have pilot
ed It to Its present Buccess are: George
Williams, president; R. Engle, vice-presi
dent; 'Charles Stickler, treasurer; James
Hughes, manager; Louis Fry, recording
secretary; and George Rowe, financial sec
retary. The directors are: Charles Mc-
Kenzle, E. W. Collins, Louis Richter,
Louis de Vassey, Bruce McNutt, William
Harvey and Joseph CottrelL
STOCKTON street, near Bush, was
aglow with light last night, and
the pavement echoed back the
ceaseless patter of lrandreas of
daintily shod feet that tripped toward a
multitude of gayly colored Chinese lan
terna that brightened the pathway lead-
Ing Into the new and luxurious home of
the Walters' Club. ,
The club has leased the tratldingr on
Stockton street, near Bush, that was for
merly the old Manhattan Club, and be
fore that the home of Chrta Buckley, one
time known In local politics. The house
has been refurnished and refitted from
top to bottom, and last night; was thrown
open for the first time for the Inspection
of the relatives. and guests of the waiters,
Â¦who will henceforth make It their home.
Muslo and refreshments were served,
and Impromptu entertainment was volun
teered by those of the hosts who could
spare enough time "from their own per
sonal friends to lend their talents to the
enjoyment of all. Altogether it was a
delightful evening, and as pleasant a
house-warming as has ever attended the
opening of any similar organization In
the city. . '
To those who know nothing of the wait
ers' organization or of the club which Is Its
home the matter may appear In the light
of some half way political affair that has
rented a hall or a couple of rooms and
DEMANDS OF
GAS COMPANY
UPON THE CITY
Supervisors Discuss
the Problem.
EXPERTS UNDER EXAMINATION
?
TALE OF LOSSES AUT> FAILING
BUSINESS.
*
The San Francisco Company Insists
That It Costs More Than One
Dollar for Manufacture
and Distribution.
Gae, â¢leotrlo, beat and power companies
were under Investigation last night by the
Board of Supervisors sitting as a commit
tee of the whole. The only corporation
under consideration was the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company and the
only part of Its business Investigated
was Its manufacture and distribu
tion of gas in this city. Representatives
of the company declared' that the reduc
tion In rates for consumers has already
cost the company at least $100,000. It costs
the company, according to the testimony
of Its engineer, JLC2G6 a thousand cubic
feet to manufacture and distribute gas.
The corporation asks therefore that the
Supervisors In fixing rates make provision
for this amount and for interest on bonds
and stocks and for taxss.
The first witness at the Inquiry *"as Ed
ward C. Jones, engineer of the San Fran
cisoo Gas and lilectrie Company. The
Mayor acted ac chief examiner, but with
this witness at least drew forth nothing
cf marked Importance. A great deal of
the examination was confined to a tech
nical discussion of the cost of coal and
oil used in the manufacture . of gaa. The
purpose of the Mayor In the examination
wa* first to ascertain and criticize the
cost of the manufacture of gas and then
to learn the value of the gaÂ» and electric
plant.
The witress had at hiÂ» ton^ue'e end the
facts and figures to Eupport his claim
that the company which employe him buys
the materiiii which supplies gas as cheap
ly as possible; that the materials are of
the beet and the results fully up to ex
pected etandards.
Descending to more specific detail* En
gineer Jones declared that gas may be
manufactured at a less price if materials
can be purchased more cheaply and wages
be reduced. During the year ISay he said
that gus was manufactured by the com
pany in the holder for 47 cents and 476
thousandths of a cent a thousand feet.
Water gas was manufactured at one sta
tion for 46 cents a thousand feet and at
another for W cents. When combined with
the coal gas an average price of 45 cents
a thousand was obtained. Mr. Jones was
very 6ure that gas cannot be manufac
tured this year as cheaply, &s materials
are dearer this year than they were last
year.
The witness volunteered the Information
that an actual test shows that the gas of
the company Is over 23 candle-power.
When Mayor Phelan suggested that no
hardship would follow to the company if
the city contracted for eueh candle-power
the witness voiced an emphatic protest,
declaring that it will be a gross injustice
upon the company to confine it to such a
hard and ia.su stipulation.
In discussing tbe capacity of the com
pany the witness declared- that in 3i99
the company rntamta^cturftJ -Â£7*,5&3 ,0u0 feet
. of -gas. cf which" â¬9G.C42,40i) teet were cold
to consumers., The difference beween the
.total uiinufacture and the ule to con
sumer* represents the gas used in street
t lighting Ly the company. In its own of
fices and la leakage.
Having discussed th* cost of manu
facture -of eaa. the witness then consid
. ered the cost of distribution. The total
cost of manufacture and of distribution,
the witness declared, .was. $!â¢<-Â£<; a thpu
' sand cubic feet In 1593. This information
Â¦ having been given, the Mayor indulged
in a. discussion w hich added nothing to
the Inquiry. A brief history of the af
fairs of the company from 1*33 to. 1899, in
clusive, Â¦was also given, and it was shown
tiiat while there was a general fluctuation
the business of the corporation had grad
ually Increased. With a blandness that
would have done credit to a lawyer Mr.
Â¦ Jones eought to boom the merits of a
Â¦ patent burner, with the evident purpose
" cf dc-cryir.g- the advantages of lncandes
' cent electric lights. The effort was pal
pable enough to fail of its purpose. â¢
In an effort to learn the complete cost
-' the Mayor asked if $1.0266 represented the
. total coEt to the corporation, including
â¢ dividends and interest. "It does not.
-was the reply of J. B. Crockett. "We do
â¢ not eend out dividends through the
pipe*." Crockett also declared that the
company had lost $100,000 since the rates
'to the dry and private consumers had
been reduced. The inquiry was then
' continued until next Monday night.

when the bailiff informed him thai he
was wanted by the court.
"What is your name?" said Judge Law
lor. Hurley answered, and then, in re
sponse to the court's question, said that
ho was not a witness in the case at the
bar. but was a friend of the accused.
"Is it not a fact," continued Judge Law
lor, " that you have been convicted of a
felonyâ an attempt at Jury briberyâ and
tliat you were the defendant In case No.
10,443 and was convicted of the crime
charged by a Jury in Department Six cf
this court and served the sentence im
posed by the court for the offense?"
"Yes," answered Hurley, "but the
charge against me was that of attempting
to influence a jury."
"Did you not in this court endeavor to
Influence Miss Abble Richardson, a wit
ness in the case?"
"I only spoke to her and asked her,
'Do you want to speak to your father?'
The officer told me not to speak to the
witnesses in the case and I left her. Even
if I have been/ in San Quentin my word
is as gdod as' though I had never been
there."
"Your word has very little weight with
the court," â¢ continued Judge Lawlor,
"and I bring you here to let you know
that you must keep out of this court and
away from its vicinity. If you fall to
obey the admonition of the court, tho
court .will believe that your presence is
inimical to the Interests of truth and the
due administration of Justice. If you
come again the court will misapprehend
the reasons for your - coming, and you
will be made to feel the weight of official
displeasure."
"I .will not come again, I warrant you
that I will not," quickly answered Hur
ley, and speedily left the courtroom.

MINING MEN CHARGED
WITH RANK PERJURY
Alleged Attempt to Grab Mineral
Land â Shasta Residents Com-
plain of Mountain Cop
per Company.
A. H. Eprague, representing an asso
ciation of miners in Shasta County, called
at the office of United States District At
torney Coombs . â¢ yesterday and charged
that perjury had been committed by Wil
lard M. Cole,. an employe of Louis T.
Wright of the Mountain Copper Com
pany. Limited," at Keswick, in that
county. â¢ â¢â¢ ; .
Mr. Sprague said that Mr.. Wright had
made application for the purchase j with
scrip 0f. 4550. acres, of.,land. in the vicinity
of the smelting works of the company,
the land being described In Mr. Cole's af
fidavit as agricultural and not fit for any
other purpose.*... It _ was said also that
there are at' the present' time 'about one
thousand. legal mineral locations upon
the land sought to be purchased and that
Cole and Wright knew at the time the af
fidavit was made that the land was of a
mineral character.-
There is now i a suit pending in the
United- States Court in this city to re
strain the Mountain Copper Company
from continuing smelting, the applicants
for the injunction setting forth that the
fumes arising from the smelter were de
stroying the Government timber, and all
other vegetation in the vicinity of the
works. Mr. Sprague and bis friends say
that the land is sought so that the injunc
tion suit may be thrown out of court, the
land in controversy comprising the whole
of the area affected by the smoke.
United States Attorney Coombs, after
hearing Mr. Sprague's statement, au
thorized J. P. Pryor, a land agent, to
visit the premises and report upon the
character of the land. Mr. Coombs said
that if Mr. Sprague's statement should be
found to be correct he will prosecute the
makers of the affidavit for perjury.

Beport of the Voyage.
Captain' Rivers' report of the voyage of
the A. G. Ropes Is as follows:
'Sailed July 29, IS3D. . "When two days out
Oeorge Xoorstrom, boatswain, a native of
Sweden, disappeared. He had i been drinking
heavily and it is believed that he Jumped over
board while- suffering from delirium tremens.
Had moderate winds until AURuat 5, when we
encountered a gale'frora south to southwest,
in which wV lost and split several Balls. Thence
to August 22. lat. 26:17 north, lon. 33 west, light
variable wjnds and calms. In- latter position
took NES trades, which were light and variable,
carrying them to 10 north. lon. 32 west. Thence
to September 6. lat. S north. lon. 30 west. light
to strong southerly winds. . In this position
we took the SE trades, . crossing: the equator
September 8, 16n. 32 west, â¢41 days out. The
SE trades were so far south we could not fetch
along the Brazilian coast, bein? obliged to beat
for a week. .Carried the SK trades to 28 south,
46 went. In lat. 46 south. lon. Â£5 west, had a
very heavy Kale from the south with hlsrh seas,
which continued five days, during which we
sustained Â¦ sllirht damage to rudder. Passed
through the Straits of Le Malre October 16, 79
days out. October 17, In a heavy southwest
Bale with tremendous sea, twisted rudder head
so badly that It was entirely useless. Con
nected tackles to monkey tiller, which In a
few hours became badly damaged. Kept away
for , the Falkland.* Islands, where we arrived
October 19, anchoring In Port William, it be
ing impossible for us to get into I'ort Stanley
SHIP A. G. ROPES AFTER HER EVENTFUL VOYAGE.
This stanch craft has just arrived in port from Xew York, after being at
sea seven months and sailing nearly 26,000 miles, half of which was made with
the ship in a partially disabled condition. .
All the assistance Captain Rivers got
from Port Stanley was the loan of six
saws, and with these he and his men fixed
up the ship In such a manner as to fcrce
the inspectors of Lloyds and the Bureau
Verltas to give her a clearance certificate
after they had said they would not do so
unless the vessel was repaired and thor
oughly overhauled at Port Stanley.
The first thing to be done In order to
make the rudder of use was to Ret a band
around the stock. A staging was rigged
up and for five days Captain Rivers and
the carpenter worked on the Job. It was
away below the freezing point and the
waves were washing over the staging
half the time. On several occasions both
master and carpenter had to be hauled
on board, and thawpd out before a fire.
Finally a mortise was made in the rud
der stock and the Iron band was pot on
and clamped. Then the main topgallant
mast was sawed In two and made Into
booms. These were ripped out over the
port and starboard quarter and bolted to
the deck. Sheaves were placed in the
end of each and through these a rope
Tan from the drum of the wheel to the
prongs on the rudder band. In this way
the vessel was steered 16,000 miles.
L. WÂ« Ropes, a brother of the owner
of the vessel, was a passenger on the
ship. He made the trip for pleasure, but
says that the next time he wants a holi
day he will go to South Africa and do
some work in the Boer army. Mr. Ropes
will remain a few days In San Francisco
globe. The distance covered during the
voyage was 25.&.X) nautical miles, and of
this over ICOOJ knots was made under
jury steering gear.
All kinds of accidents befell the stout
merchantman. Two days out from New
York the boatswain disappeared and the
crew swore the ship was "hoodooed."
Captain Rivers, however, "logged" It as
a case of "delirium tremens." The man
had been drinking heavily before he came
aboard at New York, and when deprived
of liquor he jumped overboard in his
frenzy. Some of the forecastle hands as
sert, however, that on a calm night they
con fee Bosun Xoorstrom in the waist of
the Fhlp cutting up all kinds of antics.
Off the Azores the Ropes was caught in
a pouthwester. which blew a number of
tails out cf the boltrones and made the
men Jump around lively to get the ship
under snug canvas. Off the Horn the
ruddrr-head was twisted in a terrific gale,
and when the monkey-tiller was put Into
use it also broke down. Captain Rivers
attempted to make port Stanley in order
to repair damages. It was almost Impos
sible to steer the vessel, and during the
five days the crew was fighting with the
elements the Ropes nearly went ashore
twice. FinaJly Captain Rivers put into
I'ort William, and there the repairs to the
damaged tiller were made.
Away for Caps of Good Hope.
With his steering gear in bad shape.
Captain Rivers decided that it would be
suicidal to again attempt the rounding of
Cape Horn. The vessel was accordingly
squared away for the Cape of Good Hope.
V>"hile running south and making twelve
krote an hour, the Ropes nearly ran Into
a field of ice. The ha!f-frozen"crew had
to work until the blood was coursing
through their bodies in order to get the
'anvap off the ship. No damage resulted.
lÂ»ut for several days thereafter nearly all
The running rijrtring was frozen and the
forecastle hands Insisted that "Bosun
Noomrnm and his hoodoo were still fol
lowing the ship.
That was the last of the hoodoo, hew
over, as the remainder of the voyage was
uneventful. Tfcp ship passed to the eoulh
of Xpw Zealand, was off the coast of
Queensland. Australia, some weeks later,
passed Bounty Island In December and
?topped off Pitcairn Island in January.
There the vessel received a bountiful sup
ply of vegetable?, fruit and chicken*,

BURNS' TRIAL
Defect in Indictment
Is Found.
?
Rules Governing the Building and

A variance between the language of the
contract through which it Is alleged ex-
School Director Burns, J. J. O'Brien, in

& Co., lumber merchants, defrauded the
School Department out of $30u0 an^i the

When the hearing of the cas-Â» was re

continued his argument on his. contention
that the defendants should be dismissed
by reason of the variance between the
language in the contract and tha: in the
Indictment. He argued that all leading
cases held that the language should be
exactly similar and that an exception to
the rule could not be taken in the case

POLICE COMMITTEE ON
THE POOLROOM ORDER
Not Inclined to Prohibit Downtown
Gambling: on Prizefights and
/ Horse Races.
The Supervisors' Police Committee
practically decided yesterday not to rec
ommend for passage the proposed ordi
nance prohibiting: pool-selling on any kind
of contests and also prohibiting the pub-
He from visiting such places. Supervisors
Reed and Tobin locked- horns on the
proposition of permitting racing at Ingle
side and betting on prizefights. Tobin Is in
favor Â¦of permitting horse racing for a
period of forty days, while Reed thinks
prizefights should be regulated. Super
visor Helms Is agreeable to both pastimes
which are directly affected by the sweep
ing order under consideration.
Attorney Dorn and F. H. Greene, sec
retary of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club,
expressed themselves in favor of paying
a license, should racing be permitted at
Ingleslde, but upon Reed asking if they
would pay $100 a day they replied in the
negative. Reed claimed that the only
argument advanced by the racing people
In favor of opening Ingleslde was that
they had Invested $600,000 in the scheme
and they wanted a return on that Invest
ment. He stated that there was no evi
dence that there was any demand on the
part of the people that racing be per
mitted at Ingleside.
Attorney Drum addressed the committee
for the downtown poolroom proprietors,
who. he siUd. were willing to pay a
license and to have their business put
under certain restrictions. The commit
tee decided to segregate the two matters
and Attorneys Dorn and Drum promised
to 9ubmlt two ordinances intended to
cover them at the meeting of the com
mittee next Wednesday alternoon.

5THE OLD OPPOSITION.
SENATOR PERKINS in a recent letter d^cuss
ing the outlook for the Nicaragua canal bill
says: "The recently proposed Hay-Pauncefote
treaty has a bearing upon the canal which is being
made use of by the enemies of that enterprise. The
opposition to the treaty seems to be in all respects
the same that has always opposed the' canal. It seems
to come from the same quarter and to be actuated by
the same spirit. It is ; therefore, in my opinion, an
opposition to the canal itself."
Were any confirmation needed for that statement it
could be found in a pamphlet just issued and widely
circulated, giving the views of Joseph Nimmo Jr. on
the treaty. That gentleman has long been prominent
among the opponents of the canal, and has furnished
more statistics compiled with a design to prove the
folly of constructing it than any other man in
America. The new pamphlet repeats much of the old
argument and maintains that the canal will be far
more beneficial to Great Britain than to ourselves,
and therefore should not be constructed except un
der terms that would exclude Great Britain and other
foreign nations from the use of it equally with our
selves.
Statistics of the Treasury Department are quoted
to the effect that during the year ending June 30, 1808,
the tonnage entered at ports of the United States from
foreign countries was: British, 14,583,383 tons;
other foreign ships, 5.755,970 tons; American, 5,240,
046 tons. So that of the foreign trade carried. on at
our ports the British had-57 per cent, and the Ameri-
AMUSETYTRNTa.

WASHING TON'S EXAMPLE.
WASHINGTON was born one hundred and
sixty-eight years ago. To study the world
into which he was born is to go back to a
period that in many important respects still bore the
impress of the middle ages. Washington was the
leader of the third great English, revolution. The
English struggle toward the light began with the de
nial of the prerogatives of the First Charles, and
ended with the. extinction of the divine right of kings
in the revolution of 1688. Eighty-eight years later
the last step was taken in our Declaration of Indepen
dence, which was the logical conclusion of the pre
mise laid down in the revolt against King Charles.
Washington appeared as the leader and champion of
the rights of man, and his task was the establishment
cf a government which derived its just powers from
the consent of the governed. History lays much
stress upon his military leadership, but should lay
more upon his ability, as the founder of civil govern
ment. He had a singularly clear comprehension of
the functions and limitations of government, and an
abiding faith in the principles for which he had
cleared standing-place by the sword.
A view of the masses of his countrymen at the
revolutionary period reveals them as still much at
tached to the English monarchy. More than that,
they were under the spell which the divine right of
kings had put upon men. The human mind cannot
be purged at once of teachings that have been upon
many successive generations. In his own family
Washington had been subject to the spirit of loyalty
to the King, and his mother is believed never to have
given up her devotion to the monarchy which her
great son smote with a hand and will so strong that
it bowed to his power and surrendered its possessions
to his keeping.
His faith in the institutions necessary to the ad
ministration of a government by consent was the re
sult of study of the advantages presented by our iso
lation. We were not in close contact with European
life and institutions. We must depend greatly upon
our capacity to- develop our own resources, for those
material things upon which physical life depends.
This struggle would develop and strengthen that
spirit of independence and self-reliance which must be
the foundation of free government
The first step taken in the Declaration of Indepen
dence was the most extreme radicalism the world had
ever seen. The most advanced students of civil gov
ernment in Europe, and the most hopeful believers in
the capacity of the people to govern themselves, were
almost entirely without faith in the doctrines of the
Declaration. France was with us for reasons of state
solely, and maintained toward the doctrine of our
revolution an attitude of tolerant skepticism.
As that first step was the most radical ever taken,
we must acknowledge now that its success was due
almost entirely to the conservatism of Washington.
He was content to do one thing at a time. We had
declared our purpose, had alarmed the world by its
novelty, and only the greatest wisdom, patience and
conservatism could justify our position in the insti
tutions of government which would convert novel
radicalism into a stable system without abating a
jot of its principles.
Before he. passed off the stage Washington saw his
part of the work so well established that he had no
doubt of the permanence of the system. He had a
clear conception of all future policy, and in his fare
well address made an unanswerable statement^ of
policy, which is as wise to-day and as necessary to
our peace and prosperity as it was a hundred years
apo. As it is now so will his counsel be a hundred
and a thousand years hence. Superficial thinkers mis
take change in conditions for change in principles.
Principles arc the expression of truth, which is al
ways the same. Steam and electricity, that have ef
fected a dynamic transformation of the world, have
not nullified or obsoleted a single phrase in the
Declaration nor in Washington's farewell address.
Those who mistake the material progress of these
modern days for a change in principles in effect say
that if we had had these applications of science in
1776 the Revolution would have been without ex
cuse.
Let these pseudo philosophers reverse their state
ment. The principles of the Revolution were the
matrix of all the progress that has followed. Eng
land herself has had to move forward and occupy
part of the position we stated in 1776. We have by
example enlightened man everywhere, and may say,
without boasting, that modern progress had its im
pulse in the patient conservatism with which Wash
ingtpn built upon the radical foundation of the
Declaration of Independence. His countrymen will
do well to study his ways and be wise. They will do
well to turn the inattentive ear to all who teach dis
regard of his last advice to his country.
The time has come when he should have more
monuments to remind the people of his principles and
recall to them his advice. The sublime shaft dedi
cated to his memory in the national capital might be
usefully imitated in even' State of the Union as an
expression of devotion to his principles and a pledge
that the people will abide in his counsel.

GEORGE WASHINGTONâ L. H. E.,
Sugar "Pine, Tuolumne Co., Cal. George
Washington was born In 1732, which was
when the old style calendar prevailed and
according to that the date of his birth
was February H. out when the new cal
endar was adopted In 1732. It was discov
ered that the date of his birth if it had
been under that method of computing
time, his birthday would have been the
22d and by common consent that day was
fixed as the anniversary of his birth.
SEQUENCE IN CRIBBAGEâ A. O. 8.,
Oakland, Cal. The law of sequence in
cribbage is that It "consists of three or
more cards following in successive num
bers, whether of the same suit or other
wise." He who holds them scores one
point for every card In the combination,
whether It takes place In playing or
counting the hand or crib. But there can
not be a sequence under three cards. To
form a sequence In play It makes no dif
ference which of the cards Is played first
or last, provided the sequence can be pro
duced by a transposition of the order In
which they fell. The court cards (king,
queen and knave) rank In sequence after
their usual classification as to rank, and
not alike as tenth cards. If In a play
there is played 3, 4, 5, the one who played
5 made a run of three; If the next player
plays 2 he Is entitled to a run of four,
and the next player placing a 6 on the
table is entitled to a run of five, and if the
next player plays a 3 he Is entitled to a
run of five, as he can count flve from his
last card.
FILIPINO BANDITS.
NEWS comes from Manila that a Filipino pris
oner, taken by a body of our military forces in
Luzon, after an action at arms in which a cor
poral was killed, is to be tried by court-martial for
murder.
This will be read by Americans with keen regret.
It is the adoption of the methods of Spain in Cuba
and the Philippines which we deprecated and within
two years were denouncing everywhere. The Cubans
and Filipinos were in revolution against Spain, as the
latter are against the United States. Spain treated
them as bandits and guerrillas, and shot them by
hundreds when they were taken prisoner. References
to all the speeches made in Congress before the Span
ish war discloses constant and unvaried denunciation
of Spain for this policy. In the public meetings held
all over this country r from San Francisco to Boston,
impressive pictures were drawn in many speeches
showing the slaughter of helpless prisoners, con
demned by court-martial for the offense of engaging
in revolution against Spanish sovereignty.
Yet Spain had for centuries been the master of
those people. In one way or another, affirmatively or
negatively, they had acknowledged Spanish jurisdic
tion. In the strict view of international law Spain had
a greater right to treat those people harshly than we
have. If viewed from a moral standpoint our right
can scarcely be discerned at all.
From all the information at hand from the Philip
pines it is established that practically all the people are
in sympathy with the revolt against our sovereignty.
What we have done in assertion of our jurisdiction
has naturally inflamed further the feeling that caused
the original outbreak. But behind it all lie certain
long-cherished aspirations of those people, to which
we have shown no hospitality. There is no instance
in history proving that such aspirations can be eradi
cated by any slaughter or cruelty that stops short of
universal extermination. Spain tried it in the Philip
pines, committing the most appalling and sickening
butcheries, but without avail. It is worth while to re
member that she began with moderation and finally
was compelled to do wholesale murder. The shooting
of one poor devil at Calamba, for the crime of resist
ing our armed forces, may seem a small matter. He
is not our friend or neighbor; we don't know his
name even, and he dies far away. But that does not
end it. There may be a black-eyed wife, a father or a
son, and vengeance will be patiently cherished until
opportunity offers, and then there will arise the ne
cessity for more slaughter.
We implore those who have authority to prevent
our entry upon 6uch a bloody path, upon such a pol
icy of butchery. Rather let us ascertain the aspirations
of those distant people; let us study their ambitions
and capacities and lead them elsewhere than to the
slaughter-pen.

"Kxcuse me. Brother Sogback." said an
Arkansas matron, who was one of the
High Pirates at the church festival, ad
dressing a determined-looking gentleman
who was gastronomizing at one of the
tables, "but are youâ ah!â going to stop
eating pretty soon? You have your fiftn
bowl of oyster stew now, and â ah! "
"The case." replied Brother Sogback.
with his mouth full, ."stands like this.
Sister Hooks: You made me pay in ad
vance. I forked over a five-dollar bill,
and you sweetly told me that, as it was
for the benefit of the church. It was
against the rules to give any change back.
So. now, sister, I'm goln' to keep right on

till the rules are amended for my benefit,
or I git my moneys worth, or bust.
That's the kind of a man I am. Sister

UP THE SAME OLD PATH.
RACETRACK GAMBLING AGAIN.
ON Tuesday the police raided a place on Market
street where it was suspected that illegal pool
selling was carried on, and when the officers
entered they found twenty-seven women and two men
in the room. The incident serves to recall the extent
to which pool-selling and racetrack gambling were
carried on in this city before public indignation
roused the municipal authorities to the duty of sup
pressing the evil. The crusade that ended in closing
Ingleside racetrack to the track gamblers and putting
a stop to their nefarious trade in San Francisco took
place only a short tjme ago, and yet already some of
the worst features of the evil have been revived.
It is hardly worth while to point out again the dis
tinction between legitimate and illegitimate racing.
Rightly conducted the practice of testing the speed
and the endurance of horses by means of racing is by
no means an idle sport. It tends to the improvement
of the breed of horses and results in widespread bene
fits. It has been called "the sport of kings," and has
engaged a considerable part of the energies of some
of the foremost men of all civilized countries. That
sport, however, like all others, is liable to degrada
tion, and the degradation comes when it passes from
the control of gentlemen to those of gamblers with
their following of touts and toughs. " *
It can be safely said that whenever racing is con
ducted primarily for the purpose of testing the. com
parative speed of horses.it is a legitimate and com
mendable practice, but whenever it is conducted
mainly for the purpose of gambling it becomes cor
rupting and degrading, enriching the professionals
who direct it, indeed, but doing so at the expense of
the community, and ruining hundreds of those who
become the victims of its enticements.
Racetrack gambling has been a plant of rapid and
portentous growth in this country. In the East it
became some years ago an evil of such magnitude
that drastic measures were adopted to" suppress it.
Since then a strong and unscrupulous contingent of
the Eastern gambling fraternity has come to Califor
nia to ply their trade. These persons live at the best
hotels, wear the finest of garments, dine sump
tuously every day and indulge in the costliest wines
and cigars. To support such a mode of life there is
needed a large revenue. Have .the people of San
Francisco ever stopped to consider where the revenue
comes from, where the gamblers obtain the money
they are so lavish in spending?
Racing upon gambling tracks is in its way as big a
fake and as much of a fraud as most of the so-called
"ring contests" which other gamblers carry on by the
aid of prize-fighters. The managers of the tracks fix
the conditions for entries to each event in such a way
they know fr.om the beginning which horse will win.
In betting against their combinations the public has
no more chance than in betting against a brace game
in a gambling room. The blacklegs have "a sure
thing." They win as a matter of arrangement, and
live in luxury upon the spoils of fools.
Men, boys, and even women, as the record shows,
are enticed to make bets upon the races. They lose,
and then they seek to recover the loss. In a short
time the losses mount up so high that the victims be
come involved in disaster, and exposure Is imminent.
In desperation they resort first to petty frauds to ob
tain money to make further bets in a mad hope of re
trieving themselves, and from that degree of wrong
doing proceed to downright crime. Embezzlement,
theft, robbery, murder and suicide have in this city
been within a few years traced to the effects of losses
on the racetrack or in the poolrooms. These things
were fully exploited at the time of the closing of the
gambling at Ingleside, and it should not be necessary
to go over them again to show the importance of
preventing the resumption of the practice of selling
pools upon the races at the gambling tracks.
In this connection it is to be noted the gamblers
have several times asserted that the Supervisors
would grant a new license for racing at Ingleside
racetrack. It is not likely the Supervisors .will do any
such thing. If, however, such a license .should :be
voted, the public will look to Mayor Phelan to veto
it. He signed the ordinance closing .tfae track, and
can hardly be so inconsistent as to consent to .. per
mit its opening. On that issue at least he has gone
on record unequivocally, and has surely too. much
self-respect to stultify himself upon it. > '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1900.
cans only 20 per cent. Further statistics show that
of the shipping which passed through the Suez canal
in that year the British vessels had a tonnage of 6,297,
743 tons, other foreign nations 2,939,329 tons, while
American vessels had but 153 1 tons.
Upon the showing thus made Mr. Nimmo says:
"From this and other data of similar import it is
certain that under the existing conditions controlling
our merchant marine engaged in foreign commerce,
fully 95 per cent of the tonnage which would pass
through the Nicaragua canal would be British and
other foreign, and not over 5 per cent American. So
the permission granted by Great Britain that the
United States may construct, maintain and operate
the canal at its own expense simply amounts to a
consent that this country may. construct, maintain and
operate a highway of commerce for the special bene
fit of British shipping."
The statements and conclusions of this opponent of
the canal are true so far as they go. If our merchant
marine continue under "existing conditions" the
benefits we derive from the canal will be mainly those
which result to our domestic trade between the ports
of our Pacific and our Atlantic coast. Such benefits
will be great, but they will not be enough. The force
of the argument, however, does not tend against the
construction of the canal, but against the existing
conditions, which so hamper our merchant vessels
that of those engaged in our own foreign trade we
had but 20 per cent of the tonnage in the fiscal year
of 1898, according to Mr. Nimmo's figures. Such
conditions should be changed. When we have given
to American ships the governmental support which
will enable them to compete on equal terms with the
subsidized lines of European . nations, we shall have
a full share in the trade of the ocean. The true moral
of the statistics cited is that the passage of the ship
ping bill is imperatively needed in connection with
the canal bill.

fore the time of Botta and Layard, from
certain inscriptions on stone, but which
defied interpretation until greater re
sources were at our commanu. These
cuneiform writings are in several ditlerf'r.t
styles and languages. Those of oldest
date are not strictly wedge-shaped, but
are made of short, straight lines and are
the simplified outlines of ideographs, or
picture words, that had been employed
for stone inscriptions. When they came
into use a wedge-shaped instrument was
handy for pressing the marks on the ir.olst
earth and we have genuine cuneiform
writing. This writing was now idej
graphic and syllable-that is. some cnar
acters stood for a word, while others were
phonetic and recorded a syllable. When,
later on the Persians conquered Assyria,
they adopted the same method of writing,
but in a much simplified form, using only
forty-two characters as a phonetic alpna-

Notably the most interesting and Im
portant part of Assyrian literature is com
prised in certain mythical poems and in
the great epic of Gilgamesh. Were space
at command It would be profitable to
study in detail come of these minor
poems, and especially the famous lines
which tell of the descent of Ishtar. god
dess of love and fertility, into hades, and
of the blight which her absence caused to
the upper world of light. The description
here given of the realm of the dead, on
whose portals the dust lies ever undis
turbed, is one of the most graphic pic
tures ever portrayed with the pen. But
we must pass on to the longer poem, of
which the descent of Ishtar was formerly
supposed to be an episode.
The great epic of Assyrian literature is
contained on twelve tablets, each tablet
holding a book, and extends through some
30,000 lines; but, unfortunately, the ut
most diligence hitherto has failed to dla
cover more than half the whole poem,
and much that has been discovered Is in,
so fragmentary a state as to make inter
pretation extremely doubtful. An Ameri-

goddess. t>leadlng i for the love of Gilga
mesh. There Is a note of curious mys
tery in the words with which the hero
rejects her advances. Too many lovers
have suffered a strange ill at her hands â
Tamuz, a lion, a shepherd, a bird of the
forest. Of thfr bird he says:
Thou didst crush htm and break his pinions.
In the woods he stands and laments. "O. my
pinions."
In revenge for this refusal Ishtar'a
father sends upon him a savage bull, but
the hero and his friend destroy the beast
and Gilgamesh' offers up his horns as a
sacrifice.
Then the gods snatch away Eabani. and
send sickness upen Gilgamesh; and the
hero In his grief and pain travels afar
off by a road beset with fantastical dan
gers to Parnaplshtim. who alone of man
kind is immortal. He climbs a fearful
mountain. Is ferried across the boisterous
sea and at last meets the undying hero
face to face, only to hear that death is in
evitable and that he. too. must die. "But
how then hast thou escaped death?" asks
Gilgamesh; and in reply Parnaplshtim
tells him the story of the floodâ how for
its sirs his city was burled under the
water, and only he and his wife, being
warned by a god. saved themselves In a
"six-storied" boat. "When the flood sub
sides the gods are repentant for the evil
they have wrought and grant him Immor

tween this episode and the story of the>
flood in the Bible, and unquestionably the
two accounts are different versions of
some ancient tradition. When the waters
have diminished the Assyrian Noah sends
out birds just as the Hebrew Noah:
When the seventh day approached

The dove flew about.

Then I m?nt forth a swallow.
The swallow flew about.
But, flndtiur no resting place, returned;
Then I sent forth a raven.

GUgamesh is healed of his sickness and
sent by the undying hero to seek the
plant of immortality. He finds the plant.
but a demon snatches It from his hand
and he Is forced to return, healed but
still mortal, to Uruk.
Last of all we see him wandering from
temple to temple lamenting his departed
friend Eabani. He even strives to learn
of the state of his friend in hades, and
we fee Eabani "rise up like a wind" and
stand before him. Gilgamesh cries to
him:
Tell me. my companion, tell me. my companion.

Warner's Safe Cure is a specific for kidney disease
when taken in time and according to directions. It Will not work
miracles, but it will do all that human agency can accomplish. .
time is a warning that the kidneys are not doing the work nature intended
them to do and that the body through that failure is surely becoming
poisoned by the deadly acids which ought to be eliminated.

breath, chills, fever, scanty, high colored fluids, etc. A person may not
have all of the symptoms, but one of them continued for any length of
scopical examination of the fluids of the body. Prominent among the
symptoms are fickle appetite, failure of eyesight, nervousness, frequent
desire to pass fluids, constipation, chronic rheumatic pains, gradual fail-

Bright's disease and consumption do not kill at once.
There are first, second and third stages. The time to treat these terrible
diseases is at their inception. Bright's disease is consumption of the
kidneys, and no man or woman can live without kidneys, any more than
they can without lungs.
Dropsy, heart failure, convulsions, etc., are but
symptoms of Bright's disease, a disease before which physicians stand
aghast.
etc., instead of Bright's disease.
nineteenth century none stand out more prominent than that of Warner's
Safe Cure, a vegetable preparation for the cure of that terribly insidious
disease â Bright's disease of the kidneys. The disease was first named by
Dr. Bright of England. It had been known previous to his time as
dropsy, and death certificates were given, and are given to-day, by repu-
table physicians, for dropsy, heart disease, heart failure, convulsions,
THE LITERATURE OF NINEVEH AND BABYLON.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton-
GOLDEN /\GES OF* LITERATURE.
HI. ASSYRIAN" I/ITERATTJBE.
There is something of a dispute betwean
students of things Egyptian and Assyrian
as to which records reach further Into the
past. If we could credit the imagination
of certain scholars the history of Assyria
goes back to the fabulous period that
sounds almost geological. At ( any rate,
there is age enough here to lend the mys
tery of antiquity to this study; and the
discovery and deciphering of these records
form another chapter In the romance of
modern scholarship.
In 1842 a French Consul, P. E. Botta, be
gan to make excavations near Nineveh,
where he found ruins of great extent. The
objects sent by him to the Louvre were
sufficient to awaken the curiosity of schol
ars. A few years later the work of exca
vation was taken up by Layard, and the
ruins unearthed by him in Nineveh and
Babylon from 1545 to ISSO are described by
him in volumes that have become classics
of English literature. Here for centuries
had lain, under mounds of earth blown up
by the wind, the remains of a mighty civ
ilization that long ago had aroused the in-
A Red Letter Day
THE illustrious nobles of the ancient
Arabic Order of the Mystic Shrine
who belong to Islam Temple of this
city were the exclusive possessors
last night of the Alcazar Theater
for a theater party to the members
and their wives, lady relatives and their
friends. It was a ladies' night par excel
lence, for they outnumbered the nobles
who occupied seats all over the house.
each wearing a fez and a magnificent
jewel of the ordex.
The vestibule of the theater was deco
rated with carmine silk drapings, red lan
terns and a bower of ferns, the whole pro
ducing a beautiful effect. As each lady
entered the theater she was presented
with a small silk American flag and a
souvenir programme In the shape of a
red feÂ» with black silk tassel. Shortly be
fore the curtain rose the orchestra struck
that familiar air, "We "Won't Qo Home
Till Morning," and then followed the soul
inspiring strains of the "Star-spangled
Banner," when the entire audience, num
bering: nearly twelve hundred, arose, the
ladies waving the little flags and all Join-
Ing In the chorus with a hearty good will.
It was a sight the like of which has
never before been seen In this or any other
theater in San Francisco.
The play 'was the "Prodigal Father,"
and It was interspersed with many hits
at the Shriners which were Greek to the
ladles but well understood by the members
and highly appreciated. When Miss Bla
ney, the leading lady, appeared in the
first act wearing a fez she was greeted
with a round of applause.
Preceding the third act, Reuben P. Hurl
but, the Illustrious potentate of Islam
Temple, appeared behind the footlights
and delivered a short address, telling the
audience how to form after the perform
ance and march to the hostelry on Mason
street. He stated that It had been ar
ranged to have five hundred there, but
when it was announced that there would
be 750, the landlord's hair turned gray In
a minute, and when subsequently told
that he should provide for 1200 he sur
rendered the house to the Shriners and
they were forced to engage another ca
terer. While he was talking little Miss
Edith Cooper, who took part In the per
formance, rushed up to the speaker and
called him "Uncle Hurlbut." when he took
her In his arms and kissed her. He then
on one bended knee crowned her with a
fez of the Shriners, and while he was do
ing this the curtain was raised and he
found himself in the midst of the actors
and for a few moments one of them. To
escape, he opened a bottle of sparkling
wine and the Shriners with one accord
eang "Oh, We Are Awful Dry," but there
was no response from behind the foot
lights.
Tne members and guests marched to the
hostelry, where they divided into throe
parties, occupying the three floors of the
building, and were served with a colla-'
tlon, and on the lower floor the Illustri
ous potentate who conceived the idea of
the entertainment acted as toastmaster.
and at midnight called on W. E. Smith to
responded to the toast, "Washington, the
Father of His Country." He was followed
by Charles L. Patton, who responded to
the toast of "The Ladles," and "Uncle
George" Bromley gave one of his charac
teristic talks, full of sparkling humor. The
Temple Quartette rendered several excel
lent vocal selections, and there was danc
ing on the first and third floors after the
formalities of the night, and at 4 o'clock
this morning the party sang "Auld Lang
Syne."
The illustrious potentate was assisted
by Nobles Thomas L. Hill. C. S. Benedict,
William E. Lutz. Thomas Morton, Rob
ert Moore and Hiram T. Graves.

call money remaining easy. But in spite of
these depressing factors the undertone In the
general list was rather notable for firmness
and in the railroad department net losses are
the exception rather than the rule. The grang
ers and Missouri Pacific suffered most from
celling. The undertone of firmness was due
to aggressive strength In a number of Indl

ferred, Erie Telephone and the Chicago, Illi

liberal buyer, the buying being estimated at
35 000 shares of various International stocks.
A disregard by the speculative public of the

by the United States treasury is accounted for
to some extent by the fact that sufficient
gold Is being received from Canada and from
California to partly offset the' drain to the
treasury. There was a sharp recovery In New

day. Indicating a cessation of pressure from
that source. Speculators argue that with the

will take out oil the circulation to which they
are entitled, which would Involve an expansion
of currency of about 100 per cent of the pres

Prunes and Raisins in New York.
Mall advices from JCpw York say: "A few
rpeculatlvely Inclined dealers have been try
ing to buy all the California loose muscatel
rsJslr.B. but It Is said that they have not suc
ceeded as yet. The supply Is 6mall and hoM
*rs are not anxious to dlspoce of what few
they have. On the coast thÂ« situation is re
ported unchanged, but prices are steady and
the prospect of continued firmness promising.
There Is no change In foreign goods and buy-
Ing is largely of a hand-to-mouth character.
"Prunes are steady and the prospect of an
early advance Is Indicated In the advices from
the coast to the effect that the proposed con
tract between growers and packers put out
by the Cured Fruit Association will bÂ« quite
generally signed. There has been considerable
call for 100-110 prunes, but the supply of that
eiie Is not large and holders are not par
ticularly unxious to dispos* of what they
have."
A Nezv York View.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢â¢General condltljjjis affecting the market con
tinue favorable. Tbe railroad situation is emi
nently satisfactory- According to the Chronicle
Z l^) roads reportrd earnings of t00.7C0.000 in Jan
uary, an increase of 15 per cent over the pre
ceding January, v.hich, considering the gains ]
<.f previous year*, was remarkable. The even
distribution of these gains proves the improve
ment In business to be general and not local.
The South is now sharing In this tmprove
ment more largely, the advance in cotton be
ing a great Imc-h to that section. It is calcu
lated that If the present crop <11d not exceed
j.000.n00 baies and the average jirtee in Sou th
orn market* van only 7c, it would net the
houth $4C\Â«.>oo.oo<( more than last year's crop.
The ?outh 1r also profiting from the phe
nomenal development in the cotton Industry;
not only fÂ»Â»ruring a larger profit for growing
cotton, trot an entirely new profit from man
ufacturing the staple, besides finding additional
fmjiloymT.t for a large population. The revo
lution now going quietly on In the South can
Â«mly be appreciated by those who have gone
o\f-r the ground ar.d made comparison with a
de-ade ag". I
"The call money market continues easy and
thÂ«re is no immediate prospect of change. A
sharp Â«-Â».; :.. r .pi-'?i 11. loans during the last two
or three weeks has attracted much comment.
Jn ra<M quarters it was attributed to com
mercial demands arising from business activ
ity, but this does not satisfactorily explain
1 :Â¦: Â¦ !- a large and sudden increase In loans,
end Is probably accounted for by deals or
negotiations that have not yet come to the
Furnace. The treasury Is now absorbing funds
iT'iia the banks: money Is going South for
the movement of cotton and appearances in
dicate a more active demand from Stock Ex
chfinge borrowers, so easier rates need not be
expected and less favorable bank statements
hereafter will not be a *urprt*e.
"The January Ftatement of foreign com
merce Is another remarkable and encouraging
feature. The exports of merchandise for the
month were $117.C20.000. which was $2,100,000 In
excess of the same time last year and J5.200.000
Jr. excess of January. JV'V There was naturally
a large Increase of imports due to the en
larged buying powers of the country: the total
Imports of merchandise were $75,826,000. This
Â¦was an Increase of $17.CO0.O(fl over IS5<9 and 125.
000.000 over 3SSS. The exre^s of exports over Im
ports was. however, reduced from about $31.
000,000 In the two previous Januarys to 541.753.
000 last January. The returns for the expired
portion of the flsral year continue to run on
rÂ»<*ora- breaking lines. During the last seven
months our exports have amounted to J456,
402.000. against 5386.M3.000 the same time last
year. A very considerable portion of this In
crease, It is gratifying to note, consists of
American manufactures, which are competing
more and more successfully with other nations.
Our imports In this period were JSOO, 100,000,
against I749.&O0.O00 tbe year before."

London Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were cheerful most of the
day on persistent rumors of the relief of Lady
smith, but toward the close African mining
fhares broke on pessimistic reports that Colenso
had been reoccupied by the Boers, that Colonel
Plumer's relief column had been broken up and
that General Mac Donald was severely wounded.
There was no authority for these stories except
as to Mac Donald's wounding, but -the mar
kets were depressed by them. In the street
there was a rally on a circumstantial statement
that General Cronje was surrounded. Business
was at no time large, and the settlement was
easy, exchange money being difficult to place.
Americans were the most active market on
London buying, but they sagged on New York
sales. The contango was 4VÂ«(g4Â«i. The bank
bought Â£SOOO gold In bars. The week's outflow
was Â£134,000. Call money was easy this
morning and a little was repaid to the bank,
but in the afternoon there was considerable
fresh borrowlnc Hills were scarce.
Silver was heavy on an Influx of Mexican
dollars. Paris cheque was 25.20-4; Berlin, 20.51.

NEW TOniC. Feb. 21.â Interest In the stock

the vmk. The dullness was In part due to
to-n-.orroWs holldsy, the traders hesitating to
put out new contracts on account of doubt ex
isting over the speculative outlook. Even the
closing up cf contracts incident to the eve
of a holiday waa on a small scale. Indicating
that outstanding commitments on either side
are email. The mere fact of dullness and
npathy on the buying eld* is likely to Invite
aggression by the bear party and they had
the a<ldlti-.r.al rncourazement of positive weak
ness In a handful of rtocks. of which People's

CHICAGO. Feb. i 21.â May wheat. Influenced
by easier cables, opened a shade lower at 67%@
68c. The strength of corn caused some buying,
which lifted the price to CSHc. There was a
good deal of . selling on foreign account up to
the last minute, but there was a fair com

hour further depressed the market. â¢ May
touched 67% c and closed steady at U'a'.ic under

Corn opened' firm on the wet. weather, and
higher Liverpool cables,' May ,%@%c improved
at 33?;Â®35%c. Heavy selling by strong local
Interests, however, caused.a ..reaction, which
was helped along by lesser people. The close
wan easy. May He und#r yesterday at 35c. â¢
The business In the oats pit was very small.
Elevators, were reported full, and the country
districts long on the cereal. May closed 44@Vic
lower at 23Â«4Â®23%c, -. â¢ . -,
Provisions were weak, . depressed by Â¦ the ex
ceptionally heavy hog ' receipts. The price was
gradually forced down by liquidation and the

Gripmen and Motormen Asked to
Make "Way for the City Am
bulances.
Owlnpr to the fact that grlpmen and
motormen on the Market-street and Sut
ter-street railways decline to give the
Receiving Hospital ambulances the right
of way on emergency calls, which has
led to several narrow escapes from col
lisions. Dr. Edwin Bunnell, the chief sur
geon, sent the following letter yesterday
to the superintendents of the roads:
I would call rour attention to th* way In
which your emplos'es, gripmÂ«?n or raoiormen,
full to pay any attention whatever to the. am
bulance* of the emergency hospitals, never
giving them the right of way, thereby causing
a great dpul'of loss of time, and also endan
gering the lives not only ot the patients hauled,
but also of the drivers of the ambulances, as
these driver* have Instructions to make the
beet i>osÃifcle time on their runs, and every
one, with the exception of the men on your
line?, tlvei them the right of way. It seems
to me, tn a matter of this kind, instruction*
should be sent to your men that they should
give way to these ambulances even more than
to the apparatus of the fire department, as our
department saves lives and theirs only prop
erty. - I hope that you will give this matter
your Immediate attention.

MONTEREY. Feb. 21.-The rainstorm
that began in this section on Sunday night
last still continues, with no indications ot
clearing as yet. Throughout the storm
the rain has come down gently, with that
gradual soaking effect that is so bene
ficial to. crops, and news comes from the
outlying farm sections that vegetables
and grain have received incalculable ben
efit from the- gentle and copious showers
of , the past few days. The cattle in this
section have not suffered from the lonÂ«$
drought that has just ended, because the
grass is still in excellent condition, but
grain and vegetables were greatly in need
of rain. The precipitation of the storm
has been slightly less than^two inches.
SALINAS Feb. 21.â The rain in this
section of Monterey County still con
tinues, and It was indeed essential to the

choosing such a place was that he might

with it was the following epistle:
To you, Mrs. Thompson of Pine street, Oak

don"t know. You had no right to remove the
household goods unless by order of the court.
There are articles In that house which have
been in possession of my family for over forty

Jail Stockton or Napa. During nine years of
married life I have never harmed you or your
boy You are the cause of my death an<i also
of your second husband. His words a heart as
cold as stone.
Borgwardt was 39 years of age and has
resided here for some time. The report
of the weapon that killed him was heard

come, Senator Clark's manager in his Sen

fore the Senate committee in the Clark
case to-day. His testimony was at no time
startling. Wellcome placed his expen

committee produced his bank book and
old checks to substantiate this stateme'ir.
These documents were taken in hand by
a sub-committee and were not made pub
lic.
Wellcome said he suspected Daly of
supplying the money usea in the White
side exposure. He had concluded that
the Montana Supreme Court was preju

in his disbarment trial.

FIGHT OVER FRENCH TREATY.
Two Committees of the Senate Claim
Jurisdiction.
'WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â T0-day's ex
ecutive session of the Senate developed a
sharp difference of opinion between the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
and the Committee on Finance of that
body on the French reciprocity treaty.
Davis, chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, reported the action of his
committee favorable to the treaty and
had no sooner done so that Aldrich, chair
man of the Finance Committee, represent
ing elements opposed to the treaty, moved
the reference of the treaty to his commit
tee. Davis met this motion with a point
of order agrainst present consideration and
the matter went over until the next ex
ecutive, session., .
Aldrich takes the position that as the
treaty directly affects the tariff It should
be considered by the Finance Committee,
while members of the Foreign Relations
Committee contend for its jurisdiction
over all treaties. Cullom has taken an
advanced position on this point and he
and others are prepared for a bitter con
test of Aldrlch's motion.

MINISTRY DEFEATED
IN THE REICHSTAG
Repeal of the "Dictatorial Para
graph" Enforced in Alsace-
Lorraine.
BERLIN. Feb. 21.â The Reichstag Com
mittee to-day adopted the amended bill
for the inspection of cattle for slaughter
and the Inspection of meat, Including the
more stringent penal provisions advised
by the sub-committee. -
During the day's proceedings the Reich
stag discussed ihe motion of Herr Win
terer,' an Alsatian member, to repeal tha
so-called "dictatorial paragraph" now en
forced In Alsace-Lorraine. He likened
the situation there during the last twen
ty-eight years to a state of siege. ,
The Imperial "Chancellor. Prince yon
Hohenlohe, said he could not hold "out
any hope of the repeal of the paragraph.
It must remain in rorce "as a warning to
the French minority, whose feelings are
reflected the resistance of the -clergy
of Als-ace-Lorraine to the offered estab
lishment of a theological faculty at
Strasburg, although the Holy See has
agreed to it." .
"It is true," added Prince Hohenlohe,
"that our relations with the French Gov
ernment are the best conceivable, and in
France also a friendly feeling prevails;
but there is no guarantee for the dura
tion of this feeling. For this reason we
must not relinquish our weapons. We
have acquired Alsace-Lorraine not by
popular vote but by force of arnra, and
we shall retain the reconquered land. This
is our right."
These remarks were Â¦ greeted with
cheers. The Reichstag eventually adopted
Herr Winterer's motion by a large ma
jority, thus defeating the Government. :
The Reichstag committee finished the
second reading of the meat inspection bill
to-day and the measure in its new shape
was adopted by all the members of the
commission. Generally speaking the
amended form is quite as severe in Its
application to American meats as was
the original form, but the Bundesrath is
allowed a. certain discretion which is con
sidered favorable. The main provisions
touching American interests are the fol
lowing:
The importations of canned, corned and
pickled meats, as well as sausages, is pro
hibited. The importation of hams and
bacon Is permitted. Fresh meats will be
admitted only In whole carcasses. Pre
served and prepared meats will be allowed
1 only when concededly harmless. These
provisions are to remain in force -until
1904, after which there will be greater re
striction.
All foreign meats must pass a few pre
scribed frontier stations, where they will
be subject to inspection. The penalties for
a violation of the law are more severe
than ever before.
The Agrarian press to-night declares It
self substantially satisfied with these
amendments.

.It was resolved that an additional eight
per cent of the unpaid teachers' and Janl â¢
tors' demands for November, 1898, be or
dered paid. -Â»
The outside class of the Spring Valley
School afICTO Pacific avenue was ordere-i
transferred to Union street, near Leaven
worth, on March 1. 1900.
A petition from the pupils of the Ham
ilton School to give an entertainment an 4
dance in the auditorium of the Girls' Hig'a
School was denied.
The application of Miss Jane B. Gorman
to be retired on a pension was referred
to Director Casserly for investigation.
The Board of Public Works was nske-l
to make a monthly allowance of from W
to $S per month to the principals of ilia
department, to be used for making neces
sary repairs in their school building, In
accordance with a resolution adopted by
the Board of Education.
The following transfers were ordered:

Principals and Directors Confer.
The principals of the School Department
met yesterday afternoon at the invitation
of the Board of Education in the assembly
room at the City Hall for the purpose of
discussing important matters pertaining
to the department. The meeting was
called to order by Chairman Mark, who
read an address in which he stated that
the board believed that the principals
should be consulted and occasional meet
ings should be called' to discuss future
plans for the improvement of schools."
"I desire to state," said Mr. Mark,
"that the Board of Education does not
contemplate the wholesale reduqtion of
salaries, but we hope by economy, the
consolidation of unnecessary teachers and
the discontinuance of rented rooms, to
keep within the income provided by the
cUarter. The board will report to the
Auditor in April that the average daily
attendance for the 'last'' fiscal year' was
36,M>, arid allowing *$2S-tÂ«j the pupil, as
allowed by ~ the' "charter, the amount of
reveriue : 'ior the' next fiscal year for all
salaries will be $1,034,320, making the
monthly allowance $86,193. The monthly ;
pay roll must therefore be reduced by
*5214.
"While we believe that some home work
of a definite character should be given,
we urge upon you the importance of in
teresting your teachers in assisting their
pupils to select books fit for them to
read." Â¦
Mr. .-Mark said It was the intention to
recall all substitutes on "long call", and
place all teachers consolidated out in their
positions. â¢
Principal Albert Lyser said the object
ors to the home study plan failed to real
ize an important argument in its favor,
that of making the pupil more self-reliant.
Principal. CallBghan, on the other hand,
argued In favor of giving the pupil no
home work whatever. She favored two
divisions in the class room, one of which
could study while the other- recited.
The litigation committee met after the
meeting adjourned for the purpose of tak
ing some action In having the teachers
sign a release to the Union Trust Com
pany In connection with the latest
compromise between the merchants and
teachers, by which $7000 is to be applied
to the payment of their salary demands
for November, 1898.

PASADENA WILL SHORTLY
HOLD A CHARTER ELECTION
City Council Resolves to Present the
Matter to the Electors In thÂ©
Near Future.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, FEB. 21.â The City Coun
cil took a very important and popular
step yesterday when it resolved that lt is
the Intention of the Board of Trustees
of the. city of Pasadena to take such pro
ceedings as shall result. in submitting to
the electors of the city of Pasadena at
an early date the matter of electing Free
holders for the purpose of framing a
proposed charter for the city.
The matter has been urgently pre
sented to the Council and to the indi
vidual members for a long time by the
Board of Trade and by all other organi
zations of the city. The present charter,
which is of the sixth class, is wholly
inadequate to the requirements of a city
of this size.
The Council also decided that the ac
quisition and operation of a municipal
water plant was a public necessity and
declared its intention of submitting a
bond issue to a vote in thÂ© near fu
ture. The City Engineer was instructed
to prepare plans and estimate of the cost
of establishing such a system.

ACROBATIC
POTENTE IS
FIRST AGAIN
Laughs at Harry Thoburn
This Tripâ Favorites Lose
at Tanforan.
On Monday lajt when Hard Knot was
played by a chosen few for a good thing
Potente, ridden by "Tardy" WalÃh. had
not the speed of a belated jelly doughnut,
being badly beaten for the place by Harry
Thoburh. Yesterday at Tanforan, over
the same sort of a track, he made Tho
burn seek his corner long before the gong
sounded. Â¦ They . came together again in
the six furlong handicap, for which Cor
ligan's St. Caaimir went to the post
favorite. The latter showed to be a
"dog" ot the flrat water, for, with W
pounds up he never looked dangerous.
Potente,' which, coupled with Dr. Shep
pard, receded in the betting from 2 to
16 to 5, actually rolled in first with his
stable mate second, a neck before Harry
Thoburn. This startling reversal caused
little comment as . they have become of
such frequent occurrence at the San
Mateo course.
The track was in a slushy, condition and
but two choices reached the wire in front.
Tuesday's card was such a disgustingly
bad one that it had a tendency to 4;eop
the attendance down. The betting was
also sluggish.
Willie Sink's filly, Isaline, a lukewarm
choice, met defeat by a nose in the ODen
ing five and a half furlong run. In a
long, hard drive witn the third choice,
Beautiful Bill, Plggott outrode little
Ranch the last part, earning the verdiot.
Red Cherry finished a good third.
In the mile purse run, Sam Parker's
Cormorant showed to be a mud- horse of
the most pronounced type. Equal favor
ite-in the betting with Sly, the Eastern
horse headed the Hanlon entry before half
Ihe distance had been traversed, winning
in a romp. Ben Ledi was led out a head
for the show by Charles Le Bel.
An awful ragged looking batch of
"canines" contested for the third purse
at a mile, decided under selling condition*.
Orion looked to be about the woVst. So
the looks made him an 8 to 5 favorite.
Doss* horse led to the stretch, where Nona
Such, a 6 to 1 outsider, took the first po
sition, beating the favorite in a walk. Joe
Mussle, a well backed one, made no show
ing whatever. - "
Lavator, always a good horse in the
mud, captured the seven furlong run, like
a real good one. His odds floated back
from 8 to 5 to 13 to 5, but it was not a case
of the "reverse English." for he won
hands down from Montallade. Mary Kin
sella, played to 11 to 5 favoritism, seemed
pleased to get the show.
There actually seemed nothing to the
last race but Loving Cup. and outclassing
her field shoes to plate, the mare won as
she liked. Two to 5 was the best obtain
able about her at post time, and Henry
had her in his lap at the finish, a length
in front of Katie Gibbons.

E. Roes 15 joâ¢ A long Inquiry In reference to Mrs. Cos
sack followed, but nothing of interest de
veloped. â¢ The - witness then resumed to
tell the names of others to whom she had
shown the marriage contract or had told
of Its existence. Several of these persons
have the misfortune to be dead. Daniel
O'Connell' and J. H. Culver were among
the number. . A Mrs. Purcell. who made
many dresses for Mrs. Craven had
the good fortune to see j the â¢ contract of
marriage. When O'Connell saw the doc
ument he became greatly â¢ agitated \ and
wished, immediately to give' if. publicity.
Mrs. Craven had positively refused to per
mit him,' however. '
Until ,the hour of recess the witness was
led. lnto, the intricacies of a minute inves
tigation which contributed nothing to th*
substantial results of the case.
: At the opening of the afternoon session
the opposing attorneys agreed to postpone
their argument, arid the clash of wits was
happily averted for a time. But the. res
pite was short. The lawyers opposed to
JULn. Craven-Fair Insisted upon asking
"questions of the same Import. There was
an objection, and then Attorney McEner
ney demanded and received permission to
argue his right to ask the questions. He
declared that It was vitally Important to
show that Senator Fair had made no pro
vision -for Mrs. 'Craven in his lifetime,
either in a dally or occasional support or
by will..
The attorney Insisted that the questions
which will throw light upon Fair's finan
cial treatment of the witness are there
fore vitally pertinent to the issue as
showing- by. indirection that the relation
ship- between Fair and Mrs. Craven had

T. V. Powderly, National Immigration
Commissioner, has notified United States
Immigration Commissioner North at this

that the crews of foreign vessels are sub
ject to the â¢ Immigration laws, and the in
spection provided and required, as in the
case of immigrants, so long as they re
main on the ship's articles.
This ruling indorses the action hereto
fore taken by Mr. North in the matter of
crews of foreign vessels arriving at this
port. "Whenever a member of such a crew
â¢leaves his employment on his vessel he
at once becomes an alien immigrant, and
must submit to all the requirements of

nearly everything else but the Craven-
Fair case and the mystery was not cleared
until Attorney Sylva, the exposer of con

revealed the secrets supposed to have

as much as $1 75 knocked elbows In Judge
Troutt's court yesterday and -hung with
breathless Interest on all the trifling de
tails of the Fair-Craven case, a hearing
that Involves millions. Taken altogether
It was a repelling crowd, with enough
weak chins, receding foreheads and low
ering brows to stock a good-sized Jail.
And It was shabby, with not a dozen
"blled shirts" In the lot.
It was a bad day for Mrs. Craven-Fair.
The fetid atmosphere of the crowded
courtroom oppressed her. She gasped for
air, confided to the Judge that she feared
she might swoon away and more than
once lost the even temper that has been
with her all through the trial.
Has a Fink Tea Voice.
She had a new gown on. A combina
tion of silk and velvet and lace. All
black, relieved with just a softening dash
of white at the throat. It fit her to per
fection and showed favorably the lines
of the new fashionable French figure. Her
manner was in keeping with her dress
fashionable. Her poses were the poses
of the woman of fashion. Her answers
were all In a muffled, pink-tea voice, de
livered with the proper bored expression
of the woman of the world.
Her "society tone" was most marked
when with a faint uplifting of brow and
air of surprise she met Pierson's questions
and volubly offered more information
than bis cross-examination called for.
None of the Schoolmarm Left.
There Is none of the characteristic man
ner of the educator left In Mrs. Craven-
Fair. The directness of the schoolmarm
is gone. She winds herself all up in her
answers. She has no memory for dates,
and persistently cannot "recollect." She
admitted on the stand that she was past
53 and lowered her lids when she ex
plained that Senator Fair was "attentive"
to her, and told how she feared his "at
tentions" might "cause comment."
A Pajama Episode.
There was not much chance during the
day for the lady to show how very
clever she Is until she came to the
pajama episode. Then she skated round
It with a skill worthy of a French farce
builder bringing modestly out the brazen
accompaniment of folding-doors and silk
underwear. She did not say the Sena
tor was jealous of her. She left the
court to Infer that he was.
Mrs. Margaret Koehler, the pretty
daughter of Mrsl Craven-Fair, was not
an over-interested spectator. She di
vided her time between yawns in leaning
over and smiling Into Pence's eyes and
carefully scrutinizing the fit of her
gloves. She ate candy, moistened her
lips with I-wish-I-had-a-soda smack, and
generally had an unlovely time till Judge
Troutt adjourned court and ahÂ©, wrapped
a lacey trifle round her mother's shoul
ders.
As to the attorneys, there was a lot of
brow-knitting done, and an alert watch
kept on Pierson. who was conducting the
cross-examination. Now and then Char
ley Pence and McEnerney addressed each
other and the Judge. The tobacco in
their respective mouths, however, did not
tend to purity of enunciation. The Judge
probably understood them, and they ap
peared to understand each other.'

avoided everything that might cause scan

nation commenced with a 'discussion in"
reference to the famous marriage con
tract. The witness declared that she had
shown the contract to a Mrs. Cossack, her
nurse. This alleged exhibition; took place
in 1894 at the Mission Grammar School,
where Fair was present at' the time, and,

the Secret to Constable
Creed Before the Simp

Days After It Had Been De

Which Do Not Cor

AFTER the fire of July. 1894. that de
stroyed the office of Justice of the
Peace Slmpton of Sausalito, the
Martn County Magistrate, who has
been made famous by his flopping
In the Craven-Fair UtJgation, he was
greatly perturbed over the loss of a red
pocketbook. Two days after the confla
gration hd eaid that the book contained
records o-f the utmost importance that
some day would mean much to several
people of State prominence.
Kecord of the Marriage.
Many weeks before the first Slmpton af
fidavit was made public, In which he as
serted that he had performed a marriage
ceremony uniting Nettie R. Craven and
James G. Fair, Attorney Sylva of Sausa
lito made Inquiries about the red pocket
book and !n a burst of confidence said
that !t had contained a record of that mo
mentous event.
Simpton's statement was made years
before It Is claimed Mrs.. Craven-Fair
went across the bay and offered a sum of
money to the Sausalito Simpton to testify
to the etory which he subsequently re
pudiated. Sylva's burst of confidence oc
curred, several weeks before Simpton
swore to his original affidavit and some
time before the attorney frave the public
to believe that he had thrown aside his
mask and appeared as an alleged purist,
bent upon exposing crime and unearthing
con:- pi racy.
The red pecketbook contained the record
of every nuptial knot that had been tied
by :he Sausalito Justice, who makes oath
from the middle In opposite directions,
and asserts without blushing that he Is
a mail cf whom every honest person
fchould be proud.
Less cf the Bed Pocketbook.
Constable Creed of Sausalito Township,
forrrerly Harshsl of the little town across
thf- bay. was the first man to reach Simp
t'.n's office th*Â» right that the f.ames were
claiming !t. He rushed in and saved the
records. He secured every docket and
every document that he thought was val
uable. In his haste he did not notice the
little red pocketbook and it Is presumed
That It and the tale It might tell went up
in smoke.
Two days after the conflagration, ac
cording to Constable Creed's story, Simp
ton in his presence went over the rescued
records and was visibly pained at the loss ,
cf the little red pocketbook.
"I would gladly have lost everything in
my office." Simpton Is reported to have
said, "if that little red pocketbook could
have be^n saved. It was the marriage
record of my office and in It was written
something that in the future would have
fceen of the grea-pst Importance to some
of the most prominent people of the State
and might have meant a great dead for
At that time Constable Creed did not
associate Simpton's statements with the
affairs of Xettie R. Craven and James
G. Fair. It was not until a few weeks
apo that the story of the little red pocket
book was recalled to his mlrd and he
began to wonder at Simpton's solicitude.
The Justice interviewed him then and
asked If he remembered having mentioned
the less of the book "after the fire of IÂ£S4.
Creed's recollection was vivid. Slmpton
edded that the time had arrived when
celved from Senator Fair. The Inquiry
turned quickly to the marriage contract
and the circumstances under which It was
shown to various persons. Nothing new
or Interesting: was developed. Mrs.
Craven- Fair told the same old story that
is familiar to every reader of a news
paper.. She recited the incidents in a me
chanical, uninterested way. She has told
it so^ often that it has even for her a cer
tain monotony.
An effort wm then made to discover
where and when Mrs. Craven-Fair had
met Fair out of San Francisco. The wit
ness was very clear upon two Incidents
and â¢ then tha difficulty began. Mrs. Cra
ven-Fair refused ! to understand. Sha
could not determine whether the ques
tioner wanted to know if she had met
Fair out of town or had gone out of town
with him. iTx'Sti Â¦
"We want to know,"' said Pierson, "if
you went with him out of San Francisco
anywhere in the wide, wide world."
"And before his death," facetiously
added Attorney McEnemey.
The witness recalled an incident In Chi
cago .and then was brought back in her
recital to this city. Her every movement
in 1892 and 1893 was traced. Her relations
with Fair were analyzed and a series of
critical questions were asked. The Sena
tor's nightgown kept scampering through
the recital like a specter, but at no stage
of the proceedings did It become serious.
The results of this phase of the Inquiry
