the letter was seized on the strength, of
Information given through Dr. Leyds,
whereupon M. Phillpp absconded. The
Nationalist journals insinuate that he re
ceived timely warning- from the French
Government and was thus enabled to es

Dr. Leyds, however, denies the part at

According to the Journel dcs Debats,
Philipp has gone to the United States,
where he formerly lived,' and where, it la
said, he became a bankrupt as the result
of his unfortunate management of his
business as a picture dealer.
The method by which he was trapped
recalls the Dreyfus affair. He received a
letter Inviting him to meet a veiled lady,
as In the notorious case of Lieutenant
Colonel da Paty de Clam, at a well known
cafe. Here, according to this story, he
Indiscreetly revealed his designs to the

KINDNESS OF BOERS TO
WOUNDED AUSTRALIANS
ARUNDEL, Saturday. Feb. 17 (received
by dispatch - rider) .â^Captain Longhu rst of
the British medical corps spent a night at
Hobklrk's farm attending the wounded
Australians. He says that the enemy
were: remarkably^ kind to the wounded,
providing them with mattresses and civ-
Ing them all the eggs they had. The
Boer commander and Captain Longhurst
found that they had mutual friends in
London, and were soon on the best . of
terms. The Boers and the British wound
ed fraternized. Noticing that the bando
liers of the enemy were filled with soft
nosed bullets, one of our men said: "You
ought not to. bring, such/ things to fire at
us." The Boer replied: "We must use
whatever we, can get."
This particular Boer contingent: had
come from . the northern district of the
Transvaal, where the Boers are used to
hunting big game along the Limpopo. The
men had . obtained their, ammunition for
that purpose. ;One Briton, whose thigh
had. been shattered, replied to this ex
planation: "Well,, I wish you had been
kind enough to shoot me, lower down.". ,
After the retirement of the British
forces the â¢ Boers Â¦ held â¢ a prayer-meeting
and thanked heaven for their success.
They separated ; into small parties and
moved to their various outposts, chanting
hymns as they went.
Captain Longhurst says that he - was
much Impressed 'by their considerate
treatment of the ' British ; wounded.

HEAVY FIGHTING
AHEAD OF THE
BRITISH FORCES
For the F'rst Time Since the
War Began the S tuation
Favors Them.
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted. 1900. by the New York
Herald Company.
LONDON. Feb. 19.â With General Buller
about to attempt, if he has not already
begun, for the fourth time to advance on
Ladvsmith and General Kelly-Kenny pur
suing the Boer forces toward Bloemfon
tein. there is likely to be a week of heavy
fighting.
While there is no confirmation at hand,
persistent reports Indicate that Buller in
tends this time to move by way of Co
lenso. On Wednesday he began his pre
parations by seizing Huzzar Hill, but the
censor has again become active, and no
dispatches of a later date have been
received.
Ladysmith reports that the Boers are
moving from the neighborhood of Colenso
and that the investing force Is di
minished.
Lord Roberts' strategy up to the pres
ent has been remarkably successful. At
present the situation seems to be that
General Methuen is at Magersfontein.
General Tucker at Jacobsdal and Generals
Kitchener and Kelly-Kenny, aided by the
Highland Brigade, holding the Boer army
on Its flight toward Emmaus and Patrus
berg. General French has come south
ward to Join In this movement.
There are still many obscure points in
this military operation. It is not known
whether the Boers from Spytfontein
has gone, what kind of â¢ a force French
found north of Kimberley before he turned
to Join Kelly-Kenny, nor whether Cronje.
with his force, has been arrested in his
retreat on Bloemfontein or has retired
northeastward. The Boer commander
was undoubtedly aware several days be
fore Roberts' move of the meaning of the
mobilization below Modder. and.it is be
lieved that one of his chief occupations
was to remove the heavy guns which had
been mounted around Kimberley and
Magersfontein, holding Jacobsdal with a
few men and keeping a sparse body to
line the Magersfontein trenches. Ho
probably sent . off the Creusots and Long
Toms to the north. .
The difficulties of transportation, which
have gone, what kind of a force French
against British mobility, appear to a
larffo extent to have been overcome by
JACOBSDAL, Orange Free State, Friday, Feb. 16.â Lord
Roberts' combinations for the movements of the corps
dovetailed with precision, although obstacles that had riot
been foreseen had to be overcome. The execution of his
design began at 3a. m. on Sunday. General French rode
Into Kimberley on Thursday afternoon, just when he was due,
according to the field marshal's timetable, having in four and
a half days marched ninety miles with artillery and fought
two small engagements. â¢ -
The relief of Kimberley was accomplished with the loss of
only fifty men. Twenty thousand infantry made a splendid
march under a sub-tropical sun and through a dust storm to
hold the positions which General French took.
Lord Kitchener was with General Tucker's division. In
consequence of his transport arrangement- the four divisions
moving over the sandy veldt are fed and watered. It is hardly
possible to appreciate adequately the mathematical precision
with which every part of the transport department has
worked, marching through the day, toiling almost sleeplessly
through the night, victualing the army and evolving every
hour results from seeming, chaos. Everybody did what was
expected of him cheerfully, though enduring frightful fatigues.
Few slept more than three hours. The battalions hour after
hour tolled through the heavy sand uncomplainingly, and
when now and then a man fell out of the ranks exhausted he
would rejoin his company later -after he had rested. .Some
fifty or sixty were overcome by the heat and had to be sent to
the rear In the r backward defile of empty wagons. -; Â¦*Â«.;Â¦'
The rapidity of Lord Roberts' movement away from his
base has solved one eÂ»f- the problems, perhaps the chief prob
lem of the war. He and Lord Kitchener have created a mobile
force, able to move In exterior lines and to outflank the Boers,
themselves so wonderfully mobile.
The position of the Boer army at Spytfonteln being un
tenable, General Cronje ordered a retreat. At the moment
this dispatch Is written It Is uncertain whether his whole force
or only a portion has gone toward Bloemfontein. It Is possible
that a part Is going north of Kimberley. It is supposed that a
29-ton gun Is still In the neighborhood of Kimberley. The
road from Jacobsdal to Modder Station is now open.
the genius of Kitchener.
As to the reports of Boers from ColesÂ«
berg capturing a British convoy of 200
wagons, the Daily Mall's correspondent
says that the Boers were held at bay
until reinforcements arrived.
For the first time since Ladysmith was
invested the situation Is regarded In Lon
don as distinctly favorable to the British.
In the west the British right wing la act
ing on the defensive south of Orange
River, holding Its own. while the British
left wing, beyond the Orange, has raised
the siege of Kimberley, compelling tea
retreat of the Boer right, and undertaken
Its pursuit. The primary objective of
Roberts Is still to cripple that force as the
best preparation for his principal task.
His movement eastward Into Orange
Free State will also have for its object
to disturb the Boer army in Natal by
causing the Free State troops to wish to
defend their own country. So longr as
Cronje could hold his own against the
British and while the Boer Invasion of
Cape Colony was making progress, there
was no urgent reason for uneasiness In
the head laager before Ladysmith, but
with an army which Cronje cannot resist
pushing through the Free State the Boer
commander must foresee a time when. If
he remains in Natal, he will be between
the armies of Roberts and Buller.
That Is the situation which, while the
two British armies are several marches
apart, may enable the Boers to throw
the bulk of their force against one of
their opponents, while acting on the de
fensive with a smaller body against the
other. But every day's march brings the
British forces nearer together and in
creases the prospect of danger to the
Boer army.
There is a message from Ladysmith re
porting that the Boers have some move
ment in preparation, and they may b*
sending oft a contingent to reinforce
Cronje or to make a new assault on the
town. Buller'a demonstration at Hussar
Hill and his possible advance may have
the effect of preventing either move,
While the mobilization of the reserve
squadron by the Admiralty Is meeting:
with unqualified approval. It has also
served to direct attention to the fact that
the British navy is not so strong actually
as on paper. The fact that the Admiralty
has ordered such vessels as the Nelson,
the Hercules and the Sultan to coal, that
they may be ready for commissioning. Is
a striking Illustration of this. ThesÂ«
battle-ships are out of date. They are all
armed with obsolete muzzle-loaders and
the Nelson Is so slow and cumbersome
that her name has long been a byword
In every wardroom afloat. Pitted against
modern ships, they would only prove
death traps for the men in them.
It la significant that the departure of
the channel fleet to Gibraltar has been
delayed until the reserve fleet U ready.
Lord Roberts Well-Laid Plans for the Relief of
the Besieged Town Executed Without
GENERAL CRONJE
HAS ESCAPED
HIS PURSUERS
May Lose Some of His Bag
gage, bu: His Army Is
Safe From Capture.
LONDON. Feb. 19.â 1t is now amply con
firmed that General Cronje escaped. Every
<setall received, however, proves how ad
mirably Lord Roberts' plans were con
ceived and were succeeding. But for the
unexpected delay at Dekiels Drift, which
was almost impassable for wagons, the
â¢whole Boer force would have been sur
rounded. The delay of one day there gave
them their chance for a hasty retreat. All
the other movements of Lord Roberts
were executed exactly as to time. Appar
ently General Cronje is retreating with
the main army, and even if he escapes al
together he probably will lose all his bar
rage.
There is still something doubtful about
the capture of the British convoy. Ac
cording to a Daily Mail correspondent
with the convoy, which consisted of 200
wagons, each loaded with 6000 pounds of
rations and of forage and each drawn by
sixteen oxen, it was quite unexpectedly
attacked by a. commando supposed to
come from Colefberg. The escort, consist-
Ing of eighty of the Gordon Highlanders,
forty men of the army service corps ard
& few of Kitchener's Horse, maintained a
defense until the arrival of reinforce
ments, sustaining insignificant casualties.
The Standard's correspondent at JacoL*.
dal. telegraphing Thursday, February 15,
cays:
"An attack was made yesterday upon
the rear guard of our main body by a
force of 1400 Boers, who were hurried up
from Colesberg. They succeeded In cap
turing some of our wagons, but Lord
Roberts did not delay his march to retake
these. There were few casualties on our
elde. The last of our supply columns Â«r
rived from Honey Nest Kloof to-day, hav
ing met with no opposition on the way."
The Dally News publishes the following
dispatch, dated Sunday morning, Febru
ary IS. from Modder River:
"Our sudden appearance seems to have
astounded the enemy and thrown them
Into a panic. All their positions were hur
riedly evacuated and the big guns at Ma.
gprsfonteln and Kimberley were left be
hind.
"General Cronje moved his transport,
consisting of many hundreds of wigons.
along a tank of kopjes north of the Mod
der. toward Koffyfontein. It got past our
mounted infantry, but owing to weariness
bad to ptop. Thereupon our artillery
opened upon it. The main body of the
Boer forces kept up a running: fight the
whole day, mainly trying to escape.
"Each time their advance guard sought
to move off our mounted infantry gal
loped around and checked them. We
never attempted to stop their main move
ment, contenting ourselves with trying to
check them.
"Their position at Koffyfontein is said
to be very strong. They entertain a

THE MARCH TO KIMBERLEY
wholesome dread of 10,000 cavalry, moving
more quickly than they do themselves.
We hope to be in Bloemfontein shortly."
The Daily Mall has another dispatch
from the Modder River military camp,
dated Sunday morning, which says:
"At dawn on Friday the Boers were
observed moving wagons along the kopjes
toward Koffyfohteln. Our mounted in
fantry was sent out from Klip Drift, but
was driven back, and the enemy's wagons
passed. General Knox's Twelfth Brigade,
however, quickly attacked the enemy's
main body, and severe fighting went on
all day over a line which was very ex
tended. The enemy, making a desperate
attempt, finally escaped, owing to the ser
pentine bend of the river. The mounted
Infantry Buffered from the trying flank
movement. Our force has now been re
inforced."
The correspondent of the Times at Mod
der River, wiring yesterday, says:
"General Cronje's army of 10,000 men,
with 1000 wagons, is in full retreat toward
Bloemfontein, hotly pursued by General
Kelly-Kenny. It will probably be a rear
guard fight all the way to Bloemfontein.
Our cavalry has already returned from
Kimberley to Join In the pursuit."
A dispatch to the Times from Naauw
poort, describing the retirement from
Arundel, draws attention to the devotion
of twenty men of the Victoria Mounted
Rifles, who were caught in a trap and
died to a man, fighting to the last.
ROBERTS' PROCLAMATION
TO THE FREE STATERS
CAPE TOWN, Feb. 18.â Lord Roberts
has issued a proclamation to the burghers
of the Orange Free State saying that he
feels it his duty to make known to all the
burghers the cause of the coming of the
British as well as to do all in his power
to terminate the devastation caused by
the war, and that he Issues the proclama
tion In order that if the burghers should
continue fighting they may not do so ig
norantly, but with a full knowledge of
their responsibility before God for th*
lives lost in the campaign. The procla
mation goes on to say:
The British Government believes that the
wanton and unjustifiable Invasion of British
territory was not committed with the general
approval of the people of the Free State, with
whom the British Government has lived In
complete amity for so many years. It be
lieves the responsibility rests wholly with the
Government of the Free State, acting not In
the Interests or the country, but under mis
chievous Influences from without.
Great Britain, therefore, wishes the people
of the Free State to understand that It bears
them no HI will and that, 80 far as is compati
ble with the successful conduct of (he war
and the re-eatabllshment of peace. It Is
anxious to preserve them from the evils brought
upon them by the wrongful action of their
Government. .

"Rlmington's Tigers," so called from the broad band of leopard 'skin worn around their hats, were a picked body
of colonial horsemen serving with Lord- Methuen's column. They were raised by Major M. F. Rimington, Sixth Inniskil
lins, from among the residents of the country, and their fine work in the earlier part, of the campaign earned for them the
title of the "Eyes and Ears of the Army." Later, however, their' good-fellowship with the people of the locality in which ;
they operated, many of whom were of Boer blood and sympathies, coupled with the; fact of. a .continual leakage, as to his
own movements through to the enemy, raised strong suspicion as to their fidelity, and caused General Methuen some three
weeks ago to order their disbandment. Â¦ ' - ' ,

JACOBS DAL. February 17.â General Kelly-Kenny is still
pursuing the Boers. He has now captured more than 100
wagons laden with supplies. The Highland Brigade re
inforced him after a forced march. General French has left
Kimberley to join in the pursuit of the Boer army. The guards
have occupied the Boer position at Magerslontein.
Further details of the Boer retreat show that the enemy
has been fighting a good rear guard action and occupying
successive kopjes in order to allow the moving of the convoy,
which, however, has been going at a very slow pace, the ani
mals apparently being dead beat. The latest reports show that
the Boers in the neighborhood of Klip Kraals drift are un-
General French's magnificent march is still the subject of
admiration, especially in view of the duststorms and thunder
storms that all experienced.
The work of shelling the Boers proceeds vigorously.
Owing to the style of the action, the Boers are bound to show
in the open whenever they are obliged to leave the kopjes.
BIRDS RIVER. Saturday, Feb. 17. â The position near
Dordrecht now is that the Boers occupy a strong hill north of
the town, and that the British under Gatacre hold a commanding
post to the south. Both are maintaining a brisk exchange of
shells over Dordrecht.
General Brabant's horse, 2000 strong, commenced the
march from Penhook on Thursday morning over a trackless
veldt and through a mountainous and difficult country. Early
on Friday they were fired upon, and the firing continued all day
and weli into the night, the British clearing the Boers out of
successive positions under a terrific rifle fire lasting eight hours.
Toward midnight on Friday the British forced the Boers
at the point of the bayonet out of their last position, an impor
tant one overlooking Dordrecht. The artillery duel was con-
The British casualties were eight killed, including Captain
Crallan and Lieutenant Chandler, and eight wounded. The
British captured some prisoners and a quantity of forage and

cended Monte Christo Hill.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â The Sun has the following
from Loursnzo Marquez : Commandant Lucas Meyer
wires to-day from Colenso that very heavy fighting is
going on in the Blaavv Krantz Valley. The British arc
in overwhelming numbers, but all the Federal posi*
tions were maintained when the dispatch was sent.
S~\ HIEVELEY, Sunday, Feb. 18. â General Buller has es
l# tablished his headquarters on Hussar Hill. Heavy artil
lery firing was maintained at intervals by both sides from
Wednesday until Friday. The British slowly pushed the ad
vance, and their infantry occupied new intrenched positions in
front of Hussar Hill, with slight loss. It is believed the lyddite
worked havoc in the Boer trenches.
The Boers are supposed to have moved their big guns back
over the Tugela on Friday afternoon. The rifle fire has been
heavy at times. The whole country is thickly wooded.
The British operations are directed to the capture of Hlang
wane Hill, where the Boers are strongly fortified, and from which
they are shelling the British with great accuracy.
The British infantry is now deployed along a line extending
for seven miles to the small kopjes at the foot of Monte Cristo
Hill. From 6 o'clock Friday morning the British incessantly
shelled Monte Cristo, with the nek separating it from Blaauw
Krantz Hill, on the right. The British infantry is making slow
progress up the nek in the endeavor to occupy Monte Cristo,
which will enable it to enfilade the Boers on Hlangwane.
CHIEVÂ£LEY, Wednesday, Feb. 14 (delayed by censor).
â The movement northeastward began this (Wednesday) morn
ing. Lord Dundonald, with cavalry, infantry and artillery, oc
cupied Hussar Hill, five miles north of Chieveley. The infantry
intrenched the hill. General Lyttelton worked around to the
right and Sir Charles Warren in the front and to the left.
The Boers were heavily intrenched on Hlangwane and
Monte Cristo hills. A steady, independent fire, with occasional
volleys, was maintained for hours, and the enemys' trenches were
vigorously shelled. The Boers had one gun in action during the
early part of the day, but when we began shelling they moved
it across the river. They used one Nordenfeldt in the afternoon.
Our casualties were few.
FRERE CAMP, Feb. 16.â The Boers have abandoned
several laagers. General Buller renewed the bombardment of
the Boer position without eliciting a response. Another forward
movement is regarded as imminent.

BERLIN, Feb. IS.â According to the
Taugliche Rundechau the Kaiser, in spite
of his confident language in the speech
from the throne, has, for the time being
at leaet. made up his mind that the canal

BOON TO UNEMPLOYED
Thousands Given Work Clearing New
York Streets of Their Mantle
of White.
NEW YORK, Feb. IS.-Yesterday-s
snowstorm caused little Inconvenience In
this city. Indeed, the snowstorm, which
amounted to seven inches In depth, was
a blessing to the unemployed, giving work
to thousands of men in clearing the
streets and sidewalks. The temperature
was 20 above zero. Trains were forty
minutes to one and a half hours late.
All of the vessels which came in early
this morning had been at or just off the
coast during the snowstorm. Amoug
those which came up were the American
liner St. Louis. French liner La Touraine
and the Phoenicia. The St. Louis was
sighted off Fire Island through the snow
and groped about in the vicinity of thn
Hook until this morning. Early in the
morning she lost an anchor. She was
near the Hook and riding with her port
anchor out. A swell lifted the vessel and
the cable parted near the hawser hole.
Twice while outside she passed in the
Hook, but went back again. The snow
storm let up early in the morning and
she came up to quarantine. The Phoeni
cia and La Touraine also had to strop*
around in the storm, and it took con
siderable time to dock La Touraine, ow
ing to trouble with her anchors.

GENERAL WOOD'S DECREE
CREATES A SENSATION
Cuban Press Comments Favorably
With the Exception of One Par
tisan Paper.
SAXTTAGO DE CT'BA, Feb. is.âGov
ernor-General Wood's general orders
specifying the prerogatives of military
commanders and civil governors are cre
ating a sensation here. The press, with
the exception of the violently partisan
local Cuban orpan, comments favorably
upon them, saying that they indicate an
honest Intention on the part of the inter
vening government to fulfill the pledge to
establish the Independence of Cuba.
The provision transferring public works
to. the civil department on April 1 caused
alarm among many American employes,
as they expect dismissal when the trans
fer is made. The managers of the Ameri
can and foreign business enterprises are
also somewhat concerned, as they have no
confidence in the coming Cuban adminis
tration of public afTairs. Thousands of
Cuban politicians confidently expect
recognition when the transfer is made.

MARSHALL SAYS
HE WILL PRESIDE
Kentucky Legislature to
Reconvene.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. IS.-A num
ber of the Democratic legislators returned
here to-night and numerous conferences
were in progress during the evening re
lating to the political programme to-mor
row, when the Democratic and Republi
can branches of the Legislature will meet
together for the first time since the assas
sination of Governor' Goebel. The qucsÂ»
tlun of whether Lieutenant Governor Mar
shall (Republican) or President pro tern.
Carter (Democrat) will preside in the
Senate is as wide open to-night as It has
been. The Democratic leaders Bay Sen
ator Carter will preside. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Marshall is not here, but before
leaving the city last night be stated posi
tively that he would return Monday and
Insist on his right to preside, and the Re
publican leaders assert positively to-night
that he will preside. Neither side goes
farther than these bare statements, and
what steps they will take if any to carry
out these cross-purposes respectively can
only be determined by events to-morrow.
Governor Taylor went to church to-day
without a military escort and spent the
remainder of the day at the mansion with
his family. Governor Beckham returned
to the city to-night with the Democratic
legislators and will have h!s headquarters
at the Caritol Hotel. Justus and Arthur
Go*bel also returned and will remain un
til the body of their dÂ«-ad brother Is finally
consigned to earth. The body still lies In
the little chapel In the cemetery, the rel
atives having been slow to determine the
exact spot of burial.
The question of reopening the contest
over the Governorship by presenting res
olutions In both houses ratifying the ac
tion taken fay the Democratic legislators
on two occasions declaring Senator Goebel
Governor was discussed by some of the
Democratic members to-night who favor
it. They say this would not be a conces
sion that the former proceedings were il
legal, but would probably put an end to
the controversy sooner. The matter has
not been decided on officially, but a ma
jority of the members, who are outspoken
on the matter, expressed themselves as
opposed to reopening the matter in any
form. They will abide by the decision of
the party managers, however, and there
may be some reference to it in the session
of the. Legislature to-morrow.

ANOTHER TRAGEDY
NARROWLY AVERTED
FRANKFORT, Feb. IS.â A political ar
gument between ex-State Senator Charles
J. Bronston of Lexington and Claude
Desna, chief clerk of the Senate, came
near precipitating a shooting affray on a
Chesapeake and Ohio train crowded with
returring Democratic legislators to
night. Bronston is said to have denounced
the Goebel men as revolutionists, and
Desha. to whom the remarks were ad
dresffd, denominated Bronston as a
boltfr. Angry words passed and Senator
Bronston drew a pistol. Several legisla
tor? stood between them and Â¦ prevented
trouble. Desha's friend*, say he was not
armed. Later both men agreed to drop
the matter.
DISINHERITED
HIS DAUGHTER
Klinkerfuhc Will May Be
Contested.
Special Dispatch to Tfce Call
SAN JOSE. Feb. IS.â A lively contest
over the estate of Frederick Kllnkerfuhc,
a pioneer resident of Santa Clara. Is
promised. This ill feeling has been en
gendered by the filing of a will, in which
the testator discriminated against a
daughter because of her marriage. Klink
erfuhc died last week, leaving an estate
valued at about $15,000. This is to be di
vided equally among three childrenâ Gus,
Tillie and Fred Kllnkerfuhc with the ex
ception of J5O. which was left to Mrs.
Dora Knoth, another daughter.
The will in question is dated October 22,
1.53. Arter providing for his burial and
the erection of a monument over the
graves of his Â¦wife and himself, to cost
between $300 and $500, he gives to his son,
Gus, forty acres of land and a one-third
interest in the residue of the estate.
The balance of property, consisting of a
house in Santa Clara and a vmeyard and
winery, is divided in three equal parts,
but the estate is not to be divided for
three years. Since the will was made the
disinherited daughter, Dora Knoth, has
died.
The deceased daughter was the wife of
David Knoth, and it la said she was dls
innerited because of her father's dislike
for her husband. She left three small
childrenâ Gertrude, David and Frederick
Knothâ and in their Interest the father
will wage a contest unless the other heirs
compromise by giving them a full fourth
interest.
HOUSE DEBATE
ON PORTO RICO
Tariff Bill Will Come Up
To- Day.
IMPORTANT POINT INVOLVED
FTJTTJBE STATUS OF INSTJLAB
POSSESSIONS.
Republicans Take the Stand That the
Constitution Does Not Extend
Over Newly Acquired
Territory.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18.â The House
to-morrow will enter upon the considera
tion of. the Porto Rlcan tariff bill, and the
debate upon it promises to be memorial.
The vital question at issue is whether
that clause of the constitution providing
for equality of import and excise taxes
throughout United States territory ex
tends over the island of Porto Rico, and
in this is Involved, perhaps, the oetermi
nation of the future status and govern
ment of our new possessions.
The Republicans In framing the pUI
have proceeded upon the theory that the
constitution and its immunities do not ex
tend over Porto Rico. The Democrat 3
are solidly arrayed upon the othersifie.
and In committee they were Joined by
one Republican. Call of Massachusetts.
Among the other Republicans who take
the same view 13 nittleneld of Maine, who
succeeded the late Mr. Ding-ley. The sup
port of these two prominent Republicans
has raised some hope among the opposi
tion that they may be able to defeat the
bill, although this hardly seems probable
at this writing. Both sides are preparing
for a royal struggle. Payne, the floor
leader of the majority, will open In sup
port of the bill. He will be followed by
Richardson, the minority leader. Bailey
of Texas will close for the minority. Tee
debate will continue throughout the week.
The vote will be taken on the following
Monday.
BEFORE THE SENATE.
Hawaiian Bill Will Be Discussed at
Length.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â The attention
of the Senate this week will be given
largely to the relations of the United â¢
States to ita Insular possessions. The bill f
providing a form of grovernment for the [
Hawaiian Island 3 has right of way. and
If It should be so fortunate as to be
finally acted upon before the close of the
week the Porto Rlcan bill will be Imme
diately taken up.
The probabilities are that the Hawaiian
bill will be debated at considerable
length, and that many amendments will j
be offered to It, and it may be made the
basil of more or les3 general talk on the j
question of the policy to be pursued to- I
ward the new possessions. Considerable
time will probably be necessary to the
final disposal of the bill.
All admit the urgency of legislation ;
giving the Hawalians a. government, but
there are some points on which there are i
radical differences of opinion. The most '
important of these Is the question as to
whether the commercial Intercourse be- !
tween the United States and the Elands 1
shall be under a tariff or under the free j
trade system allowed between the States j
of the Union. The bill provides for free '
trade, but several of the -Senators, under
the leadership of Senator Platt of Con- j
necticut, are making an effort to secure j
radical amendment in this respect. Sena
tor Cullom. In charge of the bill, will rÂ»- |
slst, and he will be supported by some !
Republicans and nearly all the Demo- !
cratic members. Practically the tarns i
neht will be made on the Porto Rlcan
bill.
On Wednesday Senator Lodge will de
liver a prepared speech on the Philippine
situation, and Senator Kenney will de
liver a set speech on that Question on
Tuesday.
The conference report on the currency ;
bill will likely be brought in during the j
week, and If so everything else will be
laid aside for Its consideration, A very
short debate Is expected ovÂ»r this report
when made. The diplomatic appropria
tion bill may be considered during the
week.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE WHOLE SECRET
Of the Iternarkable Success of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
Stomach Trouble.
A r.ew remedy which may revolutionize
the treatment of stomach troubles has
been placed before the public and bears
the endorsement of many leading physi-
cians and scientific men.
This preparation Is r.ot a wonderful dis-
covery nor yet a secret patent medicine.
neither is it claimed to cure anything ex-
cept dyspepsia, indigestion and stomach
troubles, with which n'.r.e-tenths of our
cation are more or le?s affected-
The remedy is ln the form of pleasant-
tanlr.p tablets or lozer.pes containing
vegetable and fruit essences, pure aseptic
prpsin <free from ar.Jmal Impurities).
Golden Sral and diastase. They are sold
by druggists under the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Many interesting experiments made
with these tablets show that they possess
remarkable digestive power, one grain of
the active principle ln ouÂ© of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets being sufficient to
thoroughly ulsest ZOOO grains of lean meat,
eggs, oatmeal or similar wholesome food.
Stuart's Tablets do not act upon the
bowels like after-dinner pills and cheap
cathartics, which simply Irritate and ln-
Kame the intestines, without havlngr any
effect whate\-er in curing indigestion.
If the Etomach can be rested and as-
sisted In the work of digestion it will very
goon recover Its normal vigor, as no or-
gan Is so much abused and overworked as
the stomach. This Is the secret and the
â¢whole 6ecret cf the remarkable success
cf Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
practically unknown a few years ago
and now the most popular, safest and
most widely sold of any treatment for
stomach weakness.
This success has been secured entirely
upon Its merits as a discstive. pure_and
pimple; because there can be no stomach
trouble if the food Is promptly digested.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entirely
upon the food eaten, digesting- it com-
pletely, so that It can be us^lmllated Into
blood, nerve ar.d tissue.
Every drop of blood, every bone, nerve
and tissue ln the body can be renewed
In but one way. and that la from whole-
some food properly digested. There Is no
other way, and tho Idea that a medicine
la Itself can purify the blood or supply
new tissues and strong nerves Is ridicu-
lous and on a. par with the fol-de-rol that
dyepepsia Is a. germ disease or that other
fallacy â that a weak stomach which re-
fuses to digest food can be made to do
so by irritating and inflaming the bowels
by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure dyspep-
eia, water brash, sour stomach, catarrh
of the stomach, gas and bloating after
meals, because they furnish the diges-
tive power, which is the one thing that
*eak stomachs lack, and unless that lack
Is supplied It Is useless to attempt to uj?-
clst It by the use of "tonics." "pills" end
cathartics. Tihich have absolutely no dl-
eeFtive power and do cot claim to have
tcy.
The regular use of one or two of Stu-
ert's Dyspepsia Tablet?, after meals, will
demonstrate their merit and efficiency
better than any other argument.
They are Fold by drug-gist* everywhere,
and a little booklet on cause and cure of
stomach troubles will be mailed free by
addressing P. A. Stuart Co.. Marshall.

GERMAN PROTECTORATE
FOR BOER REPUBLIC
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â A special to the Herald from Washington says:
A report is current in diplomatic circles in this city that Dr. Leyds had
for his sole purpose in going to Germany the establishment of a German
protectorate over the Boer republic.
The German Emperor." it is believed, has been approached and asked to
take charge of the Boer: republic. The Boers, it is said, seem to realize
their defeat at the hands of England will be the ultimate result of the present
war.
Rather than submit to subjection to Great Britain they will voluntarily come
under the sovereignty of the German Empire, under certain stipulations, which
will guarantee their local self government.
It is stated here that President Kruger, realizing that the liberties of .his
people are In danger, and that the continuance of the republic is threatened, pre
fors a German Emperor rather than an English ruler. The overture to the Ger
man Emperor was made in the first place, it was reported, with a view to creat
ing a rupture between England and Germany. This, however, was avoided, as it
is understood that Emperor William declined to consider the propositionâ at least
for the present. According to the report. Dr. Leyds, before leaving Berlin, pre
pared a secret treaty with Germany in which that country was guaranteed cer
tain rights. Al. hough tho text of the treaty is not known, it is said to give the
German Empire the greatest possible privileges, amounting almost to ownership,
ln the Transvaal republic.

AT the meeting of the San Joaquin Valley Com
mercial Association on Saturday a strong re
port v.as made on the need of better highways
in that valley and throughout the State. Indorsement
was given to the plan of constructing a State system
of highways, recommended by the State bureau, the
early construction of that portion of the system ex
tending from Redding to Bakersfield was urged, and
finally it was recommended that the construction of
good roads be made a political issue in the coming
campaign.
It is gratifying to perceive this revival of popular
interest in the good-roads movement. The subject is
one of the most important with which our rural com
munities have to deal Bad roads are about the most
expensive forms of folly in which communities can
indulge. They arc not only irritating and frequently
dangerous, but they cost about four times as much as
good roads. Statistics gathered by the Public Road,
Bureau of the Department of Agriculture at Washinz
tcn show that in the United States it costs a farmer
an average of 25 cents to haul a ton of produce for
the distance of one mi!e, while in France and in Ger
many the farmer, with clumsier vehicles and a lower
grade of horses, manages to do his hauling at an aver
age cost of but little over 6 cents a mile. The differ
ence between the cost here and the cost there is due
solely to the difference between good roads and bad

CLOVERDALE'S citrus fair has now become
one of the features of cur midwinter life. It
combines in a happy way the double good of
business and pleasure. It serves the orchardists, the
naerchanti, the real estate dealers aa/i the capitalists
cf the county as an opporturuty to make known the
excellent industrial and commercial conditions of all
the country around Cloverdale. and it also gives to
fair women and gallant men an occasion for a festival
week of such delight as to make February as joyous
From the beginning the fair and the festival have
improved with each succeeding year, and it is not
surprising to learn that arrangements have been made
this season to eclipse all previous efforts. At each
exposition there is some novelty in the way of artistic
display that attracts attention and excites emulation,
and as a consequence the taste and the talent of the ex
hibitors for that kind of accomplishment have been
developed to a point where they achieve results that
merit to be ranked 2s works of genuine art. Clover
dale's show is therefore a thing of beauty as well as
a fruit f2:r, and is well worth all the money and the
trouble it costs to go to see it.
In a certain way all California profits by the enter
prise and the skill of the Cloverdale people in mak
ing their midwinter fair one of such notable excel
lence. When, in the midst of the blizzards and snow
storms that rage around them at this season of the
year, the Eastern people read even short dispatches
announcing the fair, they get new ideas of California
and new longings to spend a winter in the land where
the orange is ripe and the rose in bloom and people
can frolic in the open air in February. As this and
ether similar fairs and festivals are thui of a general
benefit, there should be a general liberality in sup
porting them. During this week there will be a wel
come for everybody at Cloverdale and throughout
Sonoma County, and it is safe to say that none who
accepts it in the right spirit will come away without a
resolve to return again when the fair of next year is
arranged to surpass the glory of this.

PROFESSOR PLEHN of the University of Cali
fornia has received from the assistant director
ci the Philadelphia Commercial iiuseuna a let
ter which virtually assures the co-operstion o-Â£ that ia
stitiiiica ia the enterprise now twicer consideration of
establishing a commercial mn\>euni in ban rraa
clsco. The letter opens with tie declarsiion: "The
value of co-operation between the two institntroas is
certzin, considering the fact that we have expended
over $1,000,000 in reaching the point we have now at
tained; and. viewing the further fact that by means
of our correspondents, and through czr own otncials,
sent out to various parts of the world, we have built
up a chain of communication whose links cover prac
tically every country, the value to you cf free access
to this fount of information need not be dwelt upon."
In all that there is nothing to dispute or object to.
Co-operation should certainly be the policy of the
promoters of the Pacific Commercial Museum, but
I it should be co-operation oa equal terras, aad care
should be taken not to let it carry our enterprise into
a position that would make an institution oa this
; coast appear as a branch of the Eastern institution,
: and not an independent and comprehensive museum
; of itself.
There is danger that the Philade!phia directors
irotxld like to place the Pacific nnxsemn in that de
pendent position. For example, the letter under con
sideration says: "Our experience teaches us that
there is work enough to be done in the Orient alone
to engage to its fullest the activities of any institution
working zlong similar lines. Considering the geo
graphical position of San Francisco, the compara
tively easy communication between it and the Orient,
srd the natural commercial opportunities which could
be expected to arise if not -already existing between
the Pacific Coast and the Orient, it would seem that
the establishment of a commercial museum in San
Francisco which should have for its sole task the de
velopment of our trade with the Orient would be par
ticularly fitting and valuable. Our merchants, who
now enjoy 7 per cent of the rapidly increasing and
enormously valuable Chinese trade, are greatly in need
of accurate and frequent information regarding the
opportunities and changing commercial conditions of
China and the Orient generally. A commercial mv-
seurn in San Francisco in providing this information
could perform a work the value of which could not
be reckoned in dollars and cents, and in comparison
i with which any sums contributed for its support by
S citizens of city or State would be insignificant, no
j matter how great."
The point to be noted in that statement is the sug
{ gestion that the Pacific Coast museum should have
! for its "sole task" the development of our trade with
the Orient. In the very nature of things the museum
on this coast would devote its energies mainly to
i the expanding trade of China and other Asiatic
countries, but it is certain if it undertake nothing
more it will be an incomplete museum, one with a
limited scope of activity, and therefore dependent
J upon the all-comprehending museum at Philadelphia
1 for a large portion of its usefulness.
Clearly it would be a serious mistake if the pro
moters of the enterprise on this coast accept the sug
gestion of the Philadelphians. In the first place the
oriental trade, however large it may be, will fall far
short of being the whole of our commerce. We have
a large and increasing trade with Australia and with
South America. We have no inconsiderable trade
with Europe, and when the Nicaragua canal is
opened that trade, will rapidly advance, extend and
increase. A Pacific Coast museum must be planned
on a scale commensurate with the needs of Pacific
Coast commerce, and will therefore have to take the
whole world for its field, even as does the museum
in Philadelphia.
What we wish of Philadelphia is co-operation, and
for the sake of that we should concede much and
show a willingness to work in harmony with the mu
seum there, but, valuable as that co-operation may
be, it will not pay us to sacrifice independence for it.
It will be better in the long run to begin by stand
ing alone than to compromise ourselves by setting
out as a branch of another institution. By and by we
shall have a just right to ask and expect Federal aid
similar to that given to Philadelphia, and when that
time comes "we should be able to go before Con-
gress with claims based upon our own merits. To
put the matter in a single phrase: Co-operation we
wish, but independence we must have.

4EIGHT DAYS AT SEA
IN A LITTLE CANOE
STORY OF A NEW CURIOSITY AT
THE PARK MUSL'UM.
Large Crowds Enjoy a Variety of
Sport at the Chutes and
Sutro Baths.
Several thousand people who believed
they were weather prophets and risked a
day in the open In search of enjoyment
were drenched yesterday afternoon.
The shower vas of short duration, how
ever, and did more good to the flowers In
the park than harm to those on tha
millii:ory ot the pleasure seekers.
A large number of people visited tho
museum during the day. Interest cen
tered on a China Sea canoe peculiarly
fashioned out of the toughest woods. This
canoe was donated to the museum by
Captain John Williams of the British
ship Matterhcrn. who resides at No. S
Ger'myn Grove. Princess Park. Liverpool,
England. Tht canoe, in which a native,
tveak frcm hunger and perishing for wa
ter, was lying, was picked up by Cap
tain Williams 240 miles off shore south
ward of the Island of Fulo-Di-Majle of
the Anamba grpup In the China Sea. Af
ter he had regained consciousness the na
tive bald that he had been blown off
shore and had been eight days at se<*
without Icoil or drink. Three times bis
frail bark had capsized, he said, but the
exertion of righting it the third time had
left him lulpless and he expected to die
before another day bad passed.
Captain Williams took the native to
Shanghai, whence he was sent home
by the L'litish Consul. Ills canoe was
brcugÂ«ht to this city and is now the prcp
erty of the Park Museum. During the
last wrek Y. C. Lawson of this city do
nated eight pieces of paper currency !s
nued In N< rtr- Carolina during 1 the civil
war, and James AY. Moore contributed
some Kr.glish notes of ancient date.
Many new and handsome Indian baskets
have also been obtained and more are on
the way to this city at the present time.
Notwithstanding the rain a large crowd
of people remained at the Chutes during
the t-fternocn. Instead of Thursday the
amateur night this week at the Chutes
will be held on Wednesday evening.
Thuistlay will be given over to the cele
bration of Washington's Birthday. Fire
works and the electrical fountain will
illuminate the grounds. Folio wing are the
results of the contests at Sutro Baths:
Fifty-yard dash. Juvenileâ P. gund&urx ant.

CLAIMS OF THE
LIBERALIST UPON
MODERN SOCIETY
â¢
Rev. B. Fay Mills'
Able Address.
SUBSTITUTE FOR OLD FORMS
IT IS THE OUTGROWTH OF
CHRISTIANITY.
>
Catholicism Succeeded Judaism and
Protestantism Followed Catholic
ism.. He Reasons; Now
for Liberalism.
Despite rain and cold weather Metro
politan Temple was well crowded yester
day afternoon when the Rev. Benjamin
Fay Mills opened his splendid discourse
upon the "Claims of Liberal Religion
Upon the Modern World." Mr. Mills' ex
position of his chosen doctrine was most
eloquent; In his delivery he was not sen
sational, but was convincing to a degree,
and that he deeply stirred his hearers
was evident from the beginning.
The speaker opened with the declara
tion that he had no fight with orthodoxy
or the dogmas of any sect. If he had, he
said, he could not lay claim to liberalism.
He did say, however, that modern ortho
doxy was neither more nor less than old
liberalism, and that the modern liberal
ism was merely the up-to-date form of
both.
"As a Unitarian," said he, " I deny that
we deny the divinity of Christ; instead
we affirm the divinity of all men. This
divinity Is in all men and religion merely
6tirs us to dig down in our own souls and
find that of God which is in us. We can
find it as 'well out of church as in It. If
being a Catholic is good for a person, I
say then by all means continue a Cath
olic; If Protestantism is good for a man,
then let him remain a Protestant. If you
would go a little farther and seek more
modern application, then adopt liberal
ism. At one time I took a census of
those who attended one of my meetings
and found that the largest percentage of
those present were members of no church
whatever; they were liberals.-
"The Roman Catholics will tell you
that when Judaism became old and worn
out they rose up and protested against it
and offered Catholicism as the modern
form of religion; the Protestants will tell
you that when Catholicism became worn
out they rose up and offered Protestant
ism. Now if Protestantism has lost Its
vigor, Its Inspiration, its love and joy,
then Isn't it time for some one to rise up
and a^ain protest? Liberalism is the
modern form and we offer it as the latest
substitute."
Mr. Mtlljs was heartily applauded at the
end of his discourse, as was also the an
nouncement that he would again lecture
in the near future.
MERCHANTS AND
TEACHERS REACH
AN AGREEMENT
Work of Committees
Ended.
IT ALL SEEMS AMICABLE
? .. â¢-â¢ Â¦Â¦:'. | V.;
CIRCULARS TO BE SENT OUT
TO-DAY.
Â» â Â¦
School Fund Will Get More Than
$15,000 at Once and I^angÂ«r
of I/itigation Will Be
Past.
The teachers' committee appointed to
attend to the compromise or litigation of
the differences between the teachers and
the merchant creditors of the city has
reached an agreement with the merchants
which It considers a settlement of the
whole question. In a circular to be sent
to each teacher to-day the terms of thÂ«
plan of compromise are thus set forth:
The teachers' committee, consisting of C. H.
Murphy, W. D. Kingsbury, L.. de F. Bartlett.
Lizzie K. Burke and Emma E. Stincen, hereby
directs the attention of the school teachers and
Janitors to the fact that, as a result of nego
tiations carried on between said teachers' com
mittee and the committee representing the mer
chant creditors, a plan satisfactory to both
committees has been formulated, by which the
distribution of the fund of 127.524 94 now held
by the Union Trust Company, can be effected
in such manner that the teachers will get over
13 per cent of a month's salary at once, with
out giving or making any assignment or in
cumbrance of any salary warrants. In other
words, the teachers and Janitors will receive
$7000 in cash as their share of the J27.524 94
now In the hands of the Union Trust Company,
and also $$000 now in the school fund, which
will be paid to th< teachers and Janitors Instead
of the merchants; thus making $15,000, which
will be paid at once to the teachers and Jani
tors.
In addition to this, the merchant creditors
will agree that the $$000 worth of uncollected
claims, which now have priority over the
teachers' and Janitors' salary demands, shall
be subordinated to the salary demands of No
vember, and shall not be audited until those
salary demands have been audited.
This plan can be carried out If each teacher
and Janitor will sign and deliver to the Union
Trust Company a conditional release of all
claims against said fund of |27,524 94; the form
of this release is shown by the copy inclosed
herewith.
The teachers' committee Is fully convinced
that the plan above outlined affords a most
satisfactory mode of escaping from the diffi
culties and complications which have, from
the beginning, surrounded the matter of. the
distribution of the fund In question.
Attention Is called to the following ad
vantages of the proposed plan:
All that the teachers and Janitors are re
quired to do Is merely to sign a release, and
no salaries or salary warrants are to be at all
affected.
The teachers and Janitors will receive, at
once, the sum of $7000 and the additional sum
of J.SOOO. making in all an Immediate payment
of $15,000.
All of the pending litigation will be brought
to an end and the danger of future litigation
will be avoided.
As the November salaries will be given
pricrlty over the $SOOO worth of merchants'
warrants, which, as matters now stand, have
priority over the salaries, the teachers and
Janitors will have the first chance at any ad
ditional money which may. In the future,
come Into the school fund of IS9B.
The teachers who advanced their money for
the protection of all the teachers will be re
paid the amounts advanced, and no further
assessments will be necessary.
Every teacher and Janitor is therefore earn
estly requested to sign the above-mentioned
release. In this way all further litigation can
be avoided. Tho teachers cannot keep out of
litigation by remaining Inactive. Unless they
take the proper steps to effect a compromise,
they will be brought Into court by the merchant
creditors.
Arrangements will be made by which the
teachers and Janitors will be enabled to sign
the conditional releaaa. and notification will be
given of these arrangements. :
The plan above outlined has been submitted
to the Auditor and Is satisfactory to him.

Accompanying the circular containins
the plan of compromise is the following
agreement:

Trust Company of San Francisco from any
claim that he or she may have in or to the
fund of 127.524 S4. collected and held by said
Union Trust Company In pursuance of an
agreement executed In May, 1599, by said Union
Trust Company, ratifying an agreement entered
Into on, April 13. 1899. by and between a com
mittee representing certain merchant creditors
and a committee representing teachers anil
Janitors having claims against the school fund
of San Francisco for the fiscal year 1398-99, and
from any and all Obligations arising out of said
agreements of April and May, 1893â upon com
pliance with the following conditions:

against said school fund, which said Union
TruÂ«t Company bolds as their asslirnee (or the
agent of said creditors) and said Union Trust

to the teachers' committee, consisting of C. H.
Murphy, U. de F. Bartlett. W. D. Ktngsbury,
Lizzie K. Burke and Emma B. Stincen, a writ
ten agreement to the effect that said Union
Trust Company and said merchant creditors
consent and agree that none of the unpaid de
mands of said merchant creditors held by the
Union Trust Company as assignee shall be au
dited or paid until all of the salary demands
of teachers and Janitors for the month of No
vember, 1898, shall have been audited and there
shall have come into said school fund for the
fiscal year 1898-99 a sufficient sum to pay all
of said salary demands for November, 1898,
and the demands of said merchant creditors.
2. That the Union Trust Company pay to
said Asa R. Wells the sum of $7000, to be dis
tributed by him am&ng the teachers and Jani
tors an follows:
(a) $404 to be paid to the teachers' commit
tee, consisting of C. H. Murphy, L. de F. Bart
lett W. D. Klngsbury, Lizzie K. Burke- and
Emma EX Btlncen, to be used by it in defray
ing actual and necessary expenses.
(b) The amount that each teacher has paid
on account of the assessments levied for the
purposes of litigation to be repaid.
(c) The remainder to bÂ« divided among thÂ»
holders of unpaid teachers' and Janitors' claims
for November and December, 1898, in propor
tion to the amount of said claims.
It is understood and agreed by the under
signed that said Union Trust Company ehall
not be responsible for the proper distribution
of said sum of $7000, but said Trust Company
shall be deemed to have futly complied with
the above condition upon paying eaid sum of
$7000 to said Asa R. Wells.
This agreement It is expected the teich
ers will sign and return, and then the
committee will proceed to settle all differ
ences on the plan set forth in the circu
lar.

The Ascent of Man.
Rev. E. Neelander. pastor of the First
English Lutheran Church, last night dis
cussed "The Ascent of Man." In part ho
said:
To agree to the proposition that man is de
scended from an anthropoid ape Is impossible
if we believe that we are made " a little
lower than the angels." But if that doctrina
could be substantiated, then I should look
all my grim and grinning and stupid ante-
Adamic ancestors In' the face and shout at
them all "Whatever ye were, ye monaJi, yÂ»
monkeys and ye monsters, as for me and
these my brethren, now we are the sons of
God 1 " This lays the origin of man In God.
We can think of God's thoughts. We can
Imitate the character of God. We are permit
ted to do the work of God. We are still la a
world of fieids and shops and stores, and
â¢tudlcs but may be sons of God in the dis
charge of filial duties In tolling with the tools

M'DONALD'S THROAT INJURED.
The Loss of a Tooth Brings Serious
Consequences.
"William McDonald, the well-known
barytone of the Bostonlans, Is the v'ctim
of a painful misfortune, which may put
him out of business for a few daya if
nothing worse happens. Some time ngo
he commenced to experience considerable
trouble with an aching tooth. He applied
various household, remedies, but as they
afforded no relief he concluded to see a
dentist. This he did last week.
The dentist examined the tooth and told
McDonald the best thing for him was to
have the molar out. assuring him at the
same time that the operation would In
no wise affect his singing. McDonald con
sented, had the tooth out and has been
ever since laid up in bed with a swollen
mouth and jaw which hardly permit of
his speaking, let alone singing.
Mr. McDonald does not know exactly
what the trouble is. but it is thought to be
a partial paralysis of the cords of the
throat resulting from the shock of the od.
eration and the effects of the drugs used
In its accomplishment. Possibly a few
more days will see a relaxation of thÂ«
injured cords and the popular barytone
once more back on the boards.

IMPROVEMENT CLUBS
WILL DEMAND LIGHT
Supervisors "Will Hear Protests
Against Proposed Shutting Off
of City's Gas Supply.
To-day representatives from nearly
every Improvement club In the city will
appear before the Board of Supervisors to
protest against the turning off of the
street lights for the balance of the fiscal
year. The clubs are of the Opinion that
economy might be practiced with better
results in other branches of the munici
pal government and their best speakers
will be on hand to-day to say so. George
11. Fletcher, whose activity In behalf at
better- government has made him a prime
factor in matters of that sort, and presi
dent of the Federated Clubs as well, does
not agree with a number of Supervisors
that the city can afford to go without
light and to-day it Is likely he will come
to the front to make his protest.
The Supervisors themselves are wait-
Ing only for the protests of the clubs.
They acknowledge them as the represent
atives of the public and are ready to
abide by the majority of their opinions.
In case no protest is made the lights will
be shut off. If protest is made economy
will have to find its victims in other
quarters. The resolution cutting Â¦ the
Board of Health allowance to $35,000 will
come up to-day on its second reading ana
the board will also have to consider the
appointment of additional clerks to the
offices of Auditor, County Clerk, Recorder
and a half dozen other offices at the City
Hall. Mayor Phelan, It Is understood,
has made his dicker and is now prepared
to recommend the clerks of whom he will
subsequently have the appointment.
Precita Valley Wants Light.
The Preclta Valley Improvement Club
Joins with the other outside district clubs
In their protest to the Supervisors against
shutting off the street lights. The club at
its last meeting discussed the question,
and came to the conclusion that not one
Supervisor dare go before the people as
supporting the policy of shutting off the
lights. The club called the attention of
the Board of Health to the perpetual
nuisance of the sewers In the valley.

THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN POLITICS.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
A/VIERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
BT JESSE MACY, LL.D.
I. THE FEDERAUST PARTY. I
A political party may be defined briefly
as "an organ for the expression of public
opinion." Such organs have come into
existence along with the transition in gov
ernment from privilege to democracy.
They exist wherever men are striving to
realize government of, by and for the
people. In all countries where a demo
cratic ideal prevails each political party
professes to set forth and to strive to
realize that policy which will best pro
mote the Interests of the whole people.
Because men are not agreed as to what
will best promote those interests, political
parties exist. In respect to each positive;
aggressive measure there are always op
posing views; one body of men advocat
ing a change In the existing policy as
likely to serve better the welfare of the
people; others resisting the proposed
change and striving to show that it will
endanger the Interests of the people.
It Is to be continually borne in mind
trusted the financial policy of Alexander
Hamilton the rew Secretary of the Treas
ury and the real head of his party. Amontr
these were found the masses of the rural
population and the dwellers in the fcat
tered towns and hamlets throughout the
country. Many of those also who had la
bored with the federalists to secure the
adoption of the constitution found them
selves, under the readjustment arising
from the new issues, allied with the re
publicans. Madison himself was one of
the number.
On the other hand, the commercial
classes and in general the dwellers In
those parts where the population waa con
centrated, realizing better than the others
the imperative need of a stable and
straightforward financial policy and the
importance of that well ordered society
and security of life and property upon
which progress in civilization depends,
gave their adherence to the federalist*
and upheld Hamilton's propositions for
funding the debt of the Vnfon along wltS
the debts of the various States.
Personal interest doubtless entered Into
the motives actuating many of the mem
bers of both parties. Those States having
large debts to provide for â like South
CELEBRATING THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION.
that the party, properly so called. Is al
ways to be distinguished from the fac
tion or from the clas3 contending for its
own privileges. Centuries of selfish fac
tional strife preceded in England the rise
of true political parties.
Federalists and Anti-Federalists.
The study of American political parties
may properly begin with the struggle for
the adoption of the constitution. liSi-9.
American whigs and tories there had in
deed been previous to the Revolution,
who corresponded in their views to the
parties of the same names In Great
Britain. The whigs opposed the policy of
King George and his ministers, while the
tories supported it. After the close of the
war, for obvious reasons, no tory party
remained upon this side of the Atlantic,
while what had been the whig party now
included practically the whole people.
That has hence been called the first
American political party. But it is per
haps more strictly accurate to say that
the advent of r*eace and Independence
found the new nation without parties and
in a state of political fluidity ready to
crystallize into opposing forces the mo
ment the divisive element should appear.
This was supplied by the work of the
constitutional convention, which set be
fore the people a frame of government
for their adoption or rejection. During
the great debate which followed â prob
ably the most thorough, the most influ
ential debate known to our political his
tory, reaching down to the fundamental
principles of all government and familiar
izing the people throughout the land with
those ideas which underlie free govern
ment everywhere â arose the two parties
known in history as federalists and anti
federalists.
The whole subject of party names in
our early history is somewhat confused,
and the variety of terms used by differ
ent writers, with their diverse applica
tions, tends to. perpetuate this confusion.
It is, however, clear that a form of con
stitution having been adopted by the
convention which met in 1787 and placed
before the States for adoption or re
jection, the party favtrring the adoption
called themselves federalists, while the
name anti-federallat waa applied to those
who opposed the adoption of the consti
tution, declaring that the centralization
of governmental power involved would
be dangerous to individual freedom and
to the cherished rights of the several
States.
Federalists and Republicans.
Two years 'of discussion of the ques
tion, "Shall the constitution be adopted?"
led to the triumph of the federalist and
placed Washington in the Presidential of
fice. The constitution having been made
the law of the land and accepted by the
nation, and the man who was the unani
mous choice of all the people placed at
the head of the new Government, fresh
divisions must at once begin. Hence
forth political debate concerned matters
of immediately practical consequence â
the interpretation of the constitution,
which all parties now accepted and pro
fessed to venerate, the adjustment of the
difficult financial problems of the new
State and questions of foreign policy.
Naturally the leaders of thought and
opinion were gathered In the Cabinet and
the houses of Congress. While Washing
ton could be persuaded to remain In office
they could not differ as to the Presi
dency, but they could and did differ as
to the Vice Presidency, and they differed
in respect to the use to be made of the
new federal powers of the Government.
The towering Intellect of Alexander Ham
ilton could not but draw to Itself a fol
lowing of thinkers of like Inclination. The
pressing problems of state came before
them as they conferred together. Their
discussions of men and measures led them
to agree In their Judgment as to the in
dividuals best fitted for certain positions
of responsibility. The names of such per
sons were then suggested to others, to
men of prominence in their several
States. In effect those men were thus
"nominated" for office, and this coterie
of public men led by Hamilton was the
nucleus of a "party." It became the
"federal party" of the period succeeding
the adoption of the constitution. In a
precisely similar manner arose the first
republican party headed by Thomas Jef
ferson. This Is the way political parties
are made. - > - ? 'v'"-'.''''
The party In power during Washington's
two administrations and of that of John
Adams retained the name federalist, but
the opposing party now called Itself Re
publican, while its adherents, in reproach,
were sometimes called democrats by their
enemies. Sometimes we find the hyphen
ated noun "democratic-republicans"
given to the same party.
New terms and new Issues did not, how
ever, destroy the underlying basis of di
vision, which in the beginning separated
federalist and anti-federalist. The fear
of centralized power tended to persist in
the minds of those classes who had fought
against the adoption of the constitution,
and. though it has not always come to the
Burface. the came fear has beeen through
out all our after history one of the divisive
elements in our national politics. Di
vergent tendencies remained and spread
among the people after the great struggle
was apparently ended and the new admin
istration had entered upon the herculean
task of welding into a united nation the
reluctant factions which had given Â»hetr
unwilling and tardy consent to the under
' Some of those who as anti-federalists
had opposed the constitution did no doubt
give, after its adoption, their loyal adhe
sion to the administration of Washington
âthat is. to the federalist party: but the
major part cast in their lots with the new
republican party, of which Jefferson was
the acknowledged leader. Some of ;bem
believed that they saw in the new forms

federal leaders monarchical tendencies

Carolina and Massachusetts â naturally
apreed in desiring the assumption of their
obligations by the National Government,
while Pennsylvania and New Hampshire,
having less to gain by that mea-sure.
strongly opposed it. Religious motives
may have had their influence. The de
scendants of the Pilgrims and Puritans
feared the Infidelity which seemed to
mingle with Jefferson's liberal political
views.
It was at this period also that the lines
separating the agricultural and commer
cial classes were more sharply drawn and
sectional strife was intensified. Differ
ences in political thought due to differ
ences In economic conditions and supposed
interests led to diverse views of the con
stitution and to cnntradlctory applications
of theories of government, though the
fundamental principles no longer entered
Into discussion.

TO THftQR who have passed the me-
1 U 1 IiUsJE ridian of life the thought
of growing old and be-
coming helpless is not a pleasant one. There
is little to fear, however, providing one looks
carefully after one's health. With this con-
served, age comes on like a kindly winter and
life's allotted span is lived out with pleasure.
To those 60 and 70 years of age and more,
and who require a tonic to aid nature, there
is nothing can equal Warner's Safe Cure. It
is a purely vegetable preparation and keeps
the kidneys and liver in good order, aiding the
circulation of the blood, especially necessary
at this season of the year, and stopping the
cause which compels the arising at night and
which to many is a source of great discomfort.
Hundreds of testimonials can be given from
men and women who bless the day their at-
tention was first called to Warner's Safe Cure.
A single unsolicited testimonial is herewith
appended.
I take pleasure in testifying to the
merits of Warner's Safe Cure. I am'now
76 years of age and have been a great
sufferer from kidney and liver 'com-
plaint for a good many years. Tried a
great many things, but received no ben-
efit until I was advised by an old ac-
quaintance of mine who had been tak-
ing Safe Cure for the same complaint
to try it, which I did, and after using
two bottles felt better and have taken
altogether one half dozen bottles and
feel like a new man.

COAST SEAMEN TO CELEBRATE
ANNIVEBSABY OF THE UNION
IS NEAR AT HAND.
Â«
Sugar Boats From Honolulu Are
Placed in Quarantine â Overdue
Ships Causing Much TJn- .
easiness.
There was a strong westerly breeze
blowing at the heads and on the bay all
yesterday morning, and in consequence
quite a fleet of vessels that have been
outside for a couple of days came in.
There was a strong tide running when
the brig John D. Spreckels arrived, and
when the captain attempted to anchor off
Melggs Wharf the current carried her
down on the brig Galilee, 'which had ar
rived a short time previously and was ly
ing at anchor. The Galilee lost her Jib
boom and some of her headgear, while
the Spreckels lost her Jlbboom and fore
topmast and had her standing gear dam
aged. The two brigs were soon separated
and then the John D. Spreckels was taken
to quarantine, as she is from Honolulu.
About noon, when It was blowing
thirty-two miles an hour at Point Lobos,
the revenue marine receiving ship Thetis
dragged her anchors and went on a
cruise on her own account. She nearly
collided with the pilot boat Bonlta,
bumped up against Powell-street wharf
and finally docked herself In the berth
usually occupied by the quarantine tug
George M. Sternberg. When the latter
vessel came back from inspecting one of
the sugar fleet she had to move the The
tls out into the stream again before she
could dock.
The deep water arrivals yesterday were
the brig: Galilee, S6u days from Tahiti;
barkentine S. G. Wilder, 19 days from
Honolulu; schooner Amy Turner, 21 days
from Hilo; brig John D. Spreckels 14>A
days from Honolulu; bark S. C. Allen, 19
days from Honolulu; brig Lurline, 15 days
from Kahulul, and British bark Caith
ness-shlre. 74 days from Newcastle, Aus
tralia.
The Galilee brings a carjjo of cocoanuts,
fungi, pearl shell, copra and vanilla
beans. She left Papeete on January 12
and crossed the equator ten days later.
On January 23 it blew hard and there was
a nasty cross sea. During the gale the
foretopgallant mast was sprung and from
that time on Captain Densmore was able
to set nothing above a reefed fore top
gallant sail. After losing the northeast
trades the brig ran into a heavy south
easter, during which some of the sails
were blown out of the bolt ropes, while
others were split and rendered useless.
The Galilee brought no passengers and
Captain Densmore reports everything
quiet in the French possessions.
ThÂ» S. G. Wilder, John D. Spreckels and
S. C. Alleni all from Honolulu, were
placed in quarantine. The brig made a
splendid run up, beating the bark and
barkentine by four and a half days. All
three vessels will be fumigated and re-
leased some time during the week. The
Caithness-shlre made a fairly good run.
beating the American ship Snow and
Burgess, which left Newcastle with her
the same day. On January 19, in latitude
3 degrees 40 minutes south, longitude 120
degrees wpst, the Caithness-shlre passed
the barkentine Omega, which was at that
time thirty-five days out from Astoria
for Valparaiso with a cargo of lumber.
Captain Harrington of the Omega asked
to be "reported all well."
The members of the Seamen's TTnlon of
the Paoillc in San Francisco exptct to
have a big celebration on the evening of
March 6 next. It will be the fifteenth an
niversary of the organization, which came
Into existence that day as the Coast Sea
men's Union. It gradually spread itself
all over the coast, until there were
branches in every port from San Pedro
to Victoria, B. C.. and then the name
was changed to the Seamen's Union of
the Pacific.
The anniversary celebration is to take
the form of a parade to be followed by a
mass meeting and a banquet. It is ex
pected that fully 350 members of the
union will be In port on the occasion and
a splendid showing will be made in con
sequence. The parade will leave the
headquarters of the union on the corner
of East and Mission streets promptly at
7:30 p. m. March 6. It will be headed by
twelve picked men in uniform, who will
form an advance guard. Following will
be a band of twelve pieces. Then will
come Grand Marshal Edward Anderson
at the head of 150 men, forming Company
A, under Captain Frank Johnson; a band
of ten pieces, followed by flags and
transparencies, after which will come
Company B, 150 strong, under Captain
Thomas Finnerty.
At the conclusion of the parade the men
and their friends will meet in the main
hall of the union, where some of the best
speakers in the city will give addresses.
The whole proceedings will then wind up
with a banquet.
The underwriters are wondering what
has become of the British ship Annie
Thomas, now out 201 days from Cardiff
for Acapulco. She was last spoken in
latitude 57 degrees south, longitude 70 de
grees west, on October 11 last, and in con
sequence 25 per cent reinsurance is being
paid on her. The American ship May
Flint, now out 97 days from Hongkong for
Tacoma, is also a subject for uneasiness,
and 12 per cent reinsurance is being paid
on her. The May Flint is one of the
ships recently purchased from Flint &
Co. of the California Ship Company. On
the British ship Englehorn, 55 days from
Yokohama for Tacoma, 30 per cent rein
surance was paid, but the vessel reached
Port Townsend in safety a few days ago.

SHOOTING AT HAILSTORMS.
This Means of Preventing' Damage
Said to Be a Success in Europe.
The idea of destroying storm clouds In
cluding tornadoes, by firing cannon at
Them, has been laughed at In this coun
try, and experiments in this line have
not been successful, but the scheme is
taken more seriously in some parts of
Europe, and even some of the scientific
journals apsort that it Is practicable, and
cite impressive instances to prove it. The
following statements, for example, are
taken from Globus. one of the best known
tjengraphical publications of Germany:
"(Jn May GO last the Minister of Agri
culture in Italy suggested that the ex
periment be tried of destroying hail clouds
i>y means of cannon discharges. He forti
lied his pupg-estion by copious quotations
from Professor Eduard Ottavi's book on
'Destroying Hailstorms in Styria by
Means of Cannon Discharges,' the third
edition of v/hlch had just appeared. The
Italian Government thereupon placed at
the disposal of land owners the powder
in one of the Government magazines at
a. low price, until the end of October, this
year. The result was that many firing
stations were established In regions
whore vineyards were peculiarly liable to
(iaraace and the" results have been most
gratifying."
This seems to prove the theory that
destroying hailstorms by means of cannon
Is not a humbug. Furthermore, the theory
find the demonstration of its value are by
no means new. Arago tells of a fleet an
chored. In the seventeenth century, in
<:artag-ena, South America, which by bom
barding ftorms repeatedly prevented
them. In the eighteenth century a French
sailor also destroyed storm clouds in this
manner at his country place in the neigh
borhood of Macon. In Germany experi
ments were made in 18C5. In Italy the
theory has been tested on a. much larger
scale and the experiments there extend
as far back as the sixteenth century.
Professor Bombiccl of Bologna was. one
of the first to discuss the matter scien
tifically. In recent times, however, the
decisive tests have unquestionably been
made in Sryria. Austria.
The Burgomaster of Windlsch-Feistritz,
in Styria, has a very large and fine vine
yard on the south slope of the Bachen
Mountains. He sustained enormous losses
Â«-very year from hailstorms. In 1596 he
erected twelve shooting stations on the
property, distributed over about two
square kilometers. They were placed on
the highest elevations. Each station had
ten heavy cannon, handled by b\x men.
Each charge consisted of 120 grams of
powder.
As soon as a hall cloud approached
shots were heard from all the stations.
The Vienna Imperial Meteorological So
ciety thus described the procedure:
"Heavy, black clouds move forward from
above the Bachen Mountains. At a sig
nal shooting begins at all the stations,
and after a few minutes the forward
movement of the clouds ceases. . Then the
clouds open as If a canal divided them,
and gradually disappear. Not one stone
falls. The experiment was tried six times
in 1836. always with the same result. Since
then fifty-six stations have been erected
around Windiseh-Felstrltz. and it has
paid well to support them."
The question Is of great Importance to
Italy, where certain districts are regular
ly visited by hailstorms. This summer 70
stations were erected in the province of
Treviso. 30 in Padua, 2GO In Vlcenza, 20
In Verona, 133 In Bergamo and In other
provinces stations* are constructing under
the supervision of Professor Ottavl. The
cannon used wore brought from Styria
Â¦nhÂ«re a special industry In the manu
facture of this article has developed. In
Italy, also, some firms have begun to
make the so-called "Hungarian cannon."

RIDE OVER
SAN BRUNO
FOOTHILLS
Members of San Mateo County
Hunt Have an Enjoyable
Day With Hounds. J I
The San Mateo County Hunt's meet
at Uncle Tom's Cabin on Saturday
was one of the most successful In the his
tory of the club. The members were again
the guests of Francis J. Carolan, master
of the hunt, who had arranged for lunch
eon at the cabin. This was partaken of in
the open air, the weather conditions be
ing suitable for the enjoyment of life out
of doors.
The members arrived In their private
conveyances, their riding clothes con
cealed in top coats, while a procession of
grooms moved into the stable yard with
blanketed horses which were to be ridden
In the hunt. Luncheon was an entirely
Informal affair, jollity and good-natured
badinage sending- it along with a delight
ful swing which placed all those so fortu
nate as to bey present on good terms both
with themselves and the world at large.
Many ladies graced the occasion with
their presence, lending color and gayety
to the animated scene. w'
The line of the hunt was first to the
northward, passing Tanforan on the west.
A wide detour was then made into the
foothills toward the ocean, thence back
toward Burllngame. The hounds and the
field were visible for nearly an hour to
spectators, who saw the pack laid on near
San Bruno. This was due to the open na
ture of the country, thera being few trees
to obscure the vision. The reverse of this
condition obtained In the immediate neigh
borhood of San Mateo, where much of the
hunting Is done and where but little ex
cept the start and finish may be viewed
from the roadside. .
Peter Martin has broken the ice In the
matter of following the example of
Messrs. Carolan and Hobart In donning
the scarlet coat of the fox-hunting gentle
men. He appeared In the conventional at
tire of the hunting field on Saturday, and
others are expected to do likewise while
the present brilliant season is still at its
height.
Before the hounds were laid on "Char
ley" Dunphy, who Is pronounced a splen
did horseman, put the well-mannered
hunter upon which he had a mount over
the first jump several times, displaying
both his own and the horse's cleverness
at the game.
Among the regulars who followed the
hounds were: Francis J. Carolan, M. F.

RUSH FOR THE BORDER STATE
â¢
BOTH PARTIES WELL KNOWN IN
THIS CITY.
Attended by a Lady Friend, the
Bride Leaves With the Groom
on the Morning Over
land.
J. S. Hanson, the well-known furrier of
this city, was married last night In Reno
to Mlfs Lrfiura Hlckok. formerly of Oak
land but latterly of San Francisco. Miss
Jllckok is the daughter of W. B. Hickok.
the insurance man. The gToom is a man
of conFid^raMe wealth, and is known as
the "Lord of LÂ»oundes." that title vesting
In him upon tne death of his brother in
Scotland.
Behind this simple announcement is a
romantic story. With the Judicial sanc
tion of a Reparation from his llrst wife
Etlll ringing !n his ears, Hanson began his
courting of Miss Hickok just three weeks
ftfo. He prrpst'd his suit and was accept
td. the marriKÃ-e taking place at. the Riv
erside Hotel, in Reno, Rev. B. F. Hudles
ton of the Hnptist church officiating.
Mlfs Hickok did not give her ttnal word
until Saturday afternoon. A dinner party
was then arranprd. at which the prospect
ive troom, bride and a few chosen friends
tittendfd, and then the party disbanded
to meet the following day on the over
land train. Promptly upon the hour Han- ;
ton, Mks Hickok and Mrs. E. L. Atkin- '
son of this city appeared at the foot of
Market street. There was flurry and ex
citement as the trio left for the Bister
State in which the marriage ceremony
was to be celebrated. Hanson's divorce
was not absolute, the restriction upon
pubsequent marriage within a year being
enured In the decree. That was the rea
son for the hasty pilgTimag-e to Reno, the '
n+orcFX city outside the limits in which
California law holds good.
Once in Reno the couple lost no time In
securing a minister to seal the bonds of
matrimony. The witnesses to the marriage
were Mrs. K. !â. Atkinson and George \\\
Cheek, who is connected with the R'.ver
side Hotel. The marriace over, the trio
looked around for a west-bound train.
Fate, rur.ning: with an equally fast pace,
favored the party. With its usual con
sistent irregularity the overland from Ojj
<3en to San Francisco was delayed. It
was booked to pass through Reno at 4
o'clock this morning, and the intention of
the bridal party last night was to return!
to this city on it.
Both the bride, the groom and Mrs. At
kinson are very well known in San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Hanson, nee Hickok. is a
<i<-mUblonde. plump of stature and pretty
of face. The young couple -will take up
ihoir residence in this city, a home having
l>pcn fitted up in the last few days by Mr.
Hanson.

The executive committee and the general
committee composed of delegates of the
various Irish societies of San Francisco
met yesterday afternoon at 1133 Mission

ciety of the Boer army.
The executive committee convened ear'.y
in the afternoon and went Into executive
session. The particular work on haM
was the selection of the orator of tiia
day. After an hour's discussion on tiia
merits of various candidates. Thomas W.
Hickey was chesen to voice the senti
ments of the day. Hickey Is a youns
lawyer of much promise. In IS9B he grad
uated from the Hastings Law School, and
since that time he has been practicing
law. Last year he entered the field or
politics, and so rapid was his success that
he was elected secretary of- the Demo
cratic municipal convention last fall.
The executive committee also announced
the selection of Woodward's Pavilion for
both the afternoon and evening exercises.
Not much other business was transact
ed. Thomas F. Barry opened the meeting,
but relinquished the chair to J. J. O'Con
nor while he attended a meeting of the
literary committee, which deliberated
upon the selection of a poet for the day.
No choice was reached for this running
mate of the orator.
Several stirring speeches were marla
during the afternoon at the meeting of tha
general convention, the general subject
being the Boer war and what it meant fi
the Irish people. Jeremiah Deasy, J. I*.
Dignan, Theodore Pinther, the correspoi.fl
ing secretary of the Transvaal Society,
and J. A. Emery spoke long and fluently
on the heroic struggle of the weaker na
tion against the imperialistic forces cf
Kngland. Much enthusiasm was displayed
at all times, and every word of condemn i
tion against the English was greeted witti
prolonged applause.
The following new committees were ap
pointed by the executive committee:

A Leaping Sword.
"Of all the cities I have visited in
Europe." paid R. A. Stinson of Boston
recently, "I found Madrid one of the most
interesting. It has a number of out-of
the-way features that appeal to one.
"While I was in Madrid I tried to pur
chase one of the famous Toledo blades
The old-fashioned two-handled sword was
what I wanted to get, one of tho?e that
were built to cut through armor and
which fulfilled their mission completely
as many a bloody battlefield Jn ye ancient
days bore testimony. 1 had to give it up
on account of the expense. They cost
from $150 up, but while I was looking for
one a shopkeeper showed me a most sci
entific trick. His store was very lofty,
running up two or three etories, and he
was descanting on the beauties of this
particular sword, when, in order to prove
the perfect temper of the metal, he drove
the point Into the floor and bent the blade
up till hilt and point met. He then sud
denly released the hilt, and that six feet
of gleaming sword sprang up into the air
like a thing alive. Lp and up it went, al
most to Â«the loftly celling itself, when It
lost its Impetus and began its descent hilt
first. It returned almost to the place
whence it started, the shopkeeper catch
ing It by the hilt with practiced ease and
returning it to its case. 1 was crazy to
try It myself, but the owner refused to
Jillow me. as he said I would probably not
only wreck the store but perhaps injure
myself as well. He told me that If I want
ed to learn the trick I had better practice
It in a large open lot, and that a suit of
armor wouldn't be a bad thing to wear
until I got the hang of it."â New York

DIAMONDS IN RUSSIA'S CROWNS
There Were 2264 Gems Used in Mak
ing Three" of Them.
The crown of Russia is at present pre
sumably the richest in diamonds. Besides
several valuable collections in thelmperlal
treasury there are three crowns entirely
composed of these stones. That of Ivan
Alexiowitch contains 881, that of Peter the
Great 847 and that of. Catherine 11 2536
O w ne Pk \ h l ,moBt, mo8t remarkable diamonds is
the Orloff, now set In the top of *he
Imperial scepter, and on this account is
sometimes called the "Scepter" diamond
The history of this stone has been much
mixed up with that of the "Moon of the
Mountain," another great diamond in the
possession of the Czar. The most authentic
account appears to be that it formed one
of the eyes of the Hindu god Srl-Ranea
to whom was dedicated a magnificent
temple situated on a fortified island In
Mysore.
A French deserter from the Indian ser
vice, who had been at work in the neigh
borhood of this temple, hearing of the
idol's "beaux yeux" determined to be
come their possessor. As no Christians
were permitted .within the precincts of the
pagoda, he In order to gain the confi
dence of the priests, became a devotee
and so ingratiated himself with the
Brahmins that- they confided to him the
guardianship of â¢ the inner, shrine, which
contained the idol. Watching his opportu
nity one stormy night, he succeeded In
forcing one of the eyes out of its socket
and fled with it to Madras, where he sold
UISJ^" I*.1 *. to . an En >?lish sea captain for
Â£2000. who in turn disposed of it to a Je-v
for Â£12,000. From him it was purchased
by Kojeh. a Persian merchant, who at
Amsterdam, when on his way from Eng^
land to Russia, met Prince Orloff. This
Prince, In -order to regain the favor of
Catherine 11, under whose displeasure he
had fallen, bought the gem from the mer
chant for the sum of Â£30,000 and an an
nuity of Â£4000 and presented it to his im
perial mistress, who had previously de
clined the purchase as too costly, but now
accepted this truly royal gift from her
illustrious subject.
The "Orloff" diamond weighs 194 carats
and its estimated value is Â£369,800. In
size it ranks first among European gems
and in beauty yields the palm to the "Re
gent" only. It is said that Wilkie Collins"
novel "The Moonstone" was suggested < by
this stone. â Chambers' Journal.

THREE JOKES IN
A FARCE COMEDY
We have had a great deal of theatri
cal trash in San Francisco from time to
time. For example, "We, Us & C 0.,"
"Fizz, Bang, Boom," "Palntln" 'Er Red"
and "The Sign of the Cross." but nothing
more trashy than "Who Is Who," which
had Its first presentation at the Califor
nia Theater yesterday afternoon. The au
thor Is not ashamed of his handiwork, it
seems, for his name appears on the
programme: " 'Who Is Who, 1 by Herbert
Hall Winslow."
There are two comedians, Messrs. Pusey
and St. John, an auburn soubrette, a man
with a sandpaper voice, two female cor
netists, who make noises that would dis
grace the worst circus band in existence,
and a bunch of beauties of the type one
sees a great deal of (principally legs) in
the leg show paper.
The music, which, by the way, was ar
ranged by the conductor, Mr. Prince,
once of San Francisco, is sufficiently well
adapted to this rag-time age, but the
singers of the company are all in need
of pads on their voices.
Miss Eva Tanguay has a trim figure
and appears in the first act in an auburn
costume with hair to match. She changes
the former several times during the even
ing. Pusey and St. John are really funny
when left alone to their specialties and
have at least three jokes that I think
are worth repeating. The audience was
large and seemed to be amused, but, for
my part, if this is the "third edition" of
"Who Is Who" and if it is, as the adver
tisements say, "better than ever," I am
glad I did not go against It when It was
newer and worse.

For a time at Union Coursinp Park yes
terday it 6cemed that either the dogs of
the Curtis Kennel or those of the Lopez
Kennel must divide the stake, as each of
the owners had three dogs which ran well
down toward the final. Eugene Geary's '
great young greyhoud Palo Alto broke
the spell, however, defeating a representa
tive from each kennel in the third and
fourth rounds. When it came to the final
the deciding course was between Curtis'
Flying Fox and Lopez's Pepita. The for
mer was installed favorite and won by a
score of 16 to 7. The hare was one of Su
perintendent Griswold's best, and led the
dogs a merry chase across the Held. After
hard running he made his way to the es
cape, but was caught before he could get
through.
The surprise of the day was the re
markable form shown by Palo Alto, the
youngest dog in the stake, lie defeated
Merciful, ilandom Aim, "Wonder and
Cash, finally going out to Pepita in the
next to the last round. According to
Judge Grace this was hard luck, as the
young dog showed all the speed, but the
hare favored his opponent. Palo Alto
teems the best of the Kmin Pasha-Bonnie
Lass litter, of which Mr. Geary also owns
America, Bonnie Pasha and Ireland, all
promising puppies.
Hawker, the ftake favorite, was retired
by Minneola in the second round by a
score of 3 to 2. Minneola put out Royal
Union in the succeeding round, both dogs
sustaining heavy falls during the trial, it
was a day for favorites, the majority of
them being successful in the various
rounds. Tne first notable upset was the
defeat of Grafter, which sola a 4 to 1 fa
vorite over Rock Island King. Grafter
showed lameness in going to the slips and
Judge Grace issued a notice to that ef
fect to protect the bettors. There were
several undecided courses, the hares be
ing a tricky lot. It rained hard in the
rooming and again about 4 o'clock. The
sport went on, however, without inter
ruption, the field officials donning their
storm coats and continuing at their re
spective duties. The detailed results, with

TRIBUTE TO THE
MEMORY OF A
NOBLE WOMAN
Honors to the Late
Frances E. Willard.
A. M. DEWEY'S ABLE EULOGY
â . ?
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF HER
DEMISE.
Her Work in the Cause of Temperance
and Uplifting of Humanity Re
viewed at Howard-Street
M. E. Church.
The second anniversary of the death
of Miss Frances E. Willard, the great
leader in the reform temperance move
ment, who In her lifetime was the na
tional president of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, was observed last
night at Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church. While no special services
were held, A. M. Dewey, cousin of the ad
miral, who delivered an address on
"Christian Citizenship and Its Obliga
tions," took the occasion to pronounce a
panegyric upon the woman who had done
so much in the cause to which she was de
voted. Mr. Dewey was a close friend of
the deceased temperance advocate and
treated the subject of his discourse with
special rererenco to her extraordinary
lite work.
"We are gathered here to-night," said
Mr. Dewey, "to honor the memory of a
woman whom I knew well and to whom
I have often talked on the very subject
we have been considering. She studied
the industrial problem along the lines of
the temperanco movement, which she
served so well. In discussing the labor
question I am not prepared to say that
she was the greatest woman In the world,
but she was one of God's noblest crea
tures. She had few equals and no supe
riors. Miss AVillard was a new woman
of the higher type In all that represented
purity of womanhood. Like Wendell Phil
lips and Abraham Lincoln, she put for
ward the best efforts of her life to the
uplifting of humanityâ to protesting
against every wrong or injustice and In
being true to the truth at all times. It
becomes, then, the duty of her followers
to take up the work of her hands and
carry it forward to ultimate victory. To
know Miss Willard was to love her, and
who knew her best loved her most, and
were better men and women for having
known her."
In his address Mr. Dewey spoke of the
industrial conditions which prevail at the
present time, the competitive system of
which, he contended, will one day prove
the nation's undoing, unless radical meas
ures are taken to remedy them. He ar
gued that the best citizenship possessed
duties and obligations as well &a privi
leges, and had to do with public welfare
and not wiu private matters. He exhorted
his hearers to bring the Influence of
Christianity upon all their dealings with
political affairs.
"The liquor traffic," concluded Mr.
Dewey. "Is a great peril which must be
controlled, or it will control the State.
â¢>...e average politician Is a coward, who
sacrifices principle to gain votes and re
tain power. The industrial system that
arrays man against his fellow-man is not
the best system In the world, and the In
dustrial injustice, to womanhood is one of
the greatest curses of the century. With
the Christian church lies the responsi
bility to settle the question of the great
reform movement looking- to the better
ment of manhood, and for that reason
political activity is a Christian duty."

No Tips to Friends.
"A tip to a friend! Not on your life!**
said a veteran New Orleans broker, chat
ting over cigars and coffee in a reÃtau
rant last night. "I've responded on hard
luck stories as often as the next fellow,"
he continued earnestly, "and I'll do it
again, but a tip on the marketâ no! I
wouldn't give it if I knew it was a lead
pipe cinch and the other chap needed the
money to buy bread. That sounds hard,
and it's the result of hard experience.
When I was young and green I used to
put folks next to T good tilings' now and
then, and there was never a caseâ not
oneâ in which I didn't have reason to
curse my folly. In the first place, nobody
who gets a secret of that kind Is going
to keep it. One day years agoâ Just to
givo you an illustrationâ a man who was
an old friend of my father and who was
badly down on his luck, came to ask my
private advice on a Tittle speculative in
vestment. I took him into my back of
fice, swore him to secrecy, ana gave him
a piece of Information of considerable
value. I instructed him exactly what to i
do and impressed upon him that the least '
leak would ruin the whole thing, and in- j
cidentally destroy his own chances of \
making some money. I was so earnest j
that he got Indignant and asked me if I
meant to Insult him by doubting his word.
Well, inside of an hour he had told the
secret, in strict confidence,' of course, to
two particular friends, each of whom
proceeded to tell it In strict confidence to
other particular friends, giving me as the
authority all along the line, and before
night it was public property. You may
Imagine in what sort of position I wa3
placed. Men who had lost thousands of >
dollars through my indiscretion didn't
feel inclined to listen to explanations, and
some of them are my enemies to this day
I don't blame them.. When I took my man
to task he was dumfounded. He swore

PAID FOR WHEAT
AND GOT CHAFF
OAKLAND, Feb. 18.â Albert Boschan.
an East Oakland peddler, was arrested by
Captain Wilson to-day on the charge of
perpetrating one of the most unique swin
dles that has ever occurred in Oakland.
His victim, Mrs. M. Haymaker, says he
managed to sell her thirty bushels of
chaff under the plea that it was wheat.
The prisoner went to her yesterday and
represented that he had a bargain in
cereals. She was shown a handful of gen
uine wheat, and upon the representation
that his wagon contained a load of similar
goods she paid Boschan for thirty bush
els and he unloaded that amount of chaff
in the barn in the rear of the houpe.
As soon as the fraud was discovered the
police were notified and the Bwlndler was
arrested.
LABOR AND INDUSTRY.
Wisconsin's tobacco crop will yield $5,
000,000.
About $50,000,000 worth of rubber was ex
ported from Brazil last year.
During the present year over $20,000,000
has been invested in the zinc and lead
mines of Missouri.
It is said that labor will be represented
in the next Ohio Legislature by twenty
three farmers, a puddler, molder, engi
neer, metal polisher, miner and a carpen
ter.
Co-operative factories in Great Britain
last year made profits aggregating over
$1,00u,000 on a capital of a little over $11.
000,000. This is more than 10 per cent on
the investment.
Large quantities of Alabama coal are
still being shipped down the Mississippi
River for points in Louisiana and lower
Mississippi, more especially to New Or
leans. The traffic bids fair to be main
tained through the winter.
The annual report of Factory Inspector
James Campbell of Pennsylvania for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 1539, shows
that there were 152.270 more persons em
ployed in the manufacturing establish
ments under the supervision of the fac
tory Inspector In 1599 than IS9B. Mr.
Campbell says that If the demand for
skilled workmen and laborers could be
supplied the increase would be greater.

MOTHER DESERTS
HER THIRTEEH
YEAR-OLD CHILD
Little One Was Foot
sore and Weary.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 18.
Deserted by her mother and footsore
from walking. 13-year-old Maggie Bas
quez wearily walked into Oakland last
Wednesday evening and told a pitiful
story to the police officers. The forlorn
child was later placed in the custody of
Mrs. Lydia Prescott, the local agent of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, and that lady is now en
deavoring to locate the parent and have
her look after the child.
The mother lives somewhere in San
Jose. She is a widow, and several days
ago Fhe took her daughter to some insti
tution in San Francisco. The manage
ment of that place sent the girl to some
family in the country. The child be
came homesick last Wednesday morning
and ran away. After walking all day she
reached this city and attracted the atten
tion of a policeman by her pitiful crying.
"I don't know where I was in the city
and do not know who I was with In the
country." she said. "I want to go back
to my ma in San Jose. She lives at 92
Vine street."
Should the mother refuse to take charge
of the girl she will be looked after by
ENGLAND HAS NO BIRTHDAY.
The Only Country in the World
Without a National Holiday.
There Is one country In the world,
and one only, which has no birthday or
national holiday. Nor is that country in
some remote corner of the mapâ it is Eng
land. Although the Queen's birthdayâ
May 24 â Is annually celebrated in royal
fashion, it is not a national holiday, and
Englishmen and women have at last
aroused themselves to the fact that they
are quite alone In this respect.
"What day shall we choose for our na
tion's birthday?" they are now asking.
"Shall it be the Queen's birthday or the
day of her ascending the throne, or any
day which she herself shall name?"
There was a movement not long ago to
bring forward St, George's day as tho na
tion's birthday, St. George being Eng
land's patron saint. The birthdays of dif
ferent countries all have very good and
substantial reasons for being.

Glass Buttons.
Among the lesser things fashionable but
mighty in importance are the buttons
which are now in evidence upon whatever
manner of gown. The new glass bottons
are eingularly beautiful. They are plain
or cut, and appear in every possible shade,
light or richly toned, in blues and violets,
pink and greens, so much liked. They
are used even on muslin, organdies or lace
frocks, especially for the long polonaises,
and are used all the way down the frontâ
or the back, as the case may be. The
heart shape is much liked at present, and
comes in pearl or glass. For lace coata
and redingotes the buttons are a decided
feature. Frequently for such use they are
of glass overlaid with gold filagree or of
very handsome pearl.
Speaking of colored glassâ lt will be seen

MODERN COATS OF MAIL.
Curious Story of the Way British
Officers Protect Themselves.
To the uninitiated the days of armor
have long since gone, but a visit to a
certain firm situated In the "West End of
London will reveal the fact that hundreds
of vests of mail are sold annually to offi
cers In the British army. The maker is
a well-known gunsmith, and a large por
tion of his income Is derived not from
manufacturing guns, but through the sale
of armor to officers.
As a general rule the mall la Inclosed
in a leather casing, which is sewn inside
the tunic, so as to be invisible unless the
garment is picked to pieces. And the
same with helmets â a similar device Is
fixed as lining bo as to give additional
protection in case of need. Some officers
are not above wearing mall vests under
neath their tunics and perfectly obvious
to their comrades, who, although they
may scoff In time of peace, would be only
too glad to don one themselves when in
the middle of hostilities.
The majority of the maker's customers
are officers, because the suits are very ex
pensive, costing about Jol each. Neverthe
less some "Tommies" are prepared to
spend that amount in order to insure
themselves to a certain extent against the
enemy's spent bullets. Against a modern
bullet, fired at short distance, of course,
these suits of armor are next to useless,
although they may be instrumental In
turning its course or stopping its pene
trating power.
During the Chinese-Japanese war of
1593 the maker in question sent out sev
eral hundred suits of armor, which were
eagerly bought up by the combatants at
a heavy price. During the American war
of last year he did the same thing; It was
not so successful, for he found he had
been forestalled by Yankee firms, and
such officers in the American army as had
intended going in for suits of mail had al
ready obtained them- He then offered his
goods to the Spaniards, who proved to be
good customers and were prepared to pay
a good price for the luxury.
A notable instance of the value of mall
occurred during the battle of Omdurrr.an,
last September. One officer, who Is well
known, got into the thick of the fight and
was slashed on all sides by the dervishes.
His men were surprised to see that he had
escaped all the force of the blows, expect
ing to see him fall from his horse every
minute, a mass of wounds. After the bat
tie was over, however, he appeared per
fectly unscathed, except for a few slight
wounds on the chest. Then he revealed
the suit of mail which covered him and to
which he owed his life. â London Globe.

111S Broadway. Feb. IS.
Charle* S. Johnson, the well-known at

TO BE CHOSEN FOR HIGH OFFICE
IN THE ORDER OF B'NAI B'RITH
was Invited to address the convention. It
recommended that an appeal be made to
Jewish parents stating the aim and ob
jects of the order and of the auxiliary
lodges, and requesting such Jewish
parents to have the members of their
families become members of the order.
In the evening the convention took up
the consideration of -the reports of the
finance and library committees, which
were made a special order of business.
The finance committeeâ H. P. Bush, chair
man; I* Llppman and Philip Flatowâre
ported that for the first time in many
years there was a net balance In the
Grand Lodge fund, which amounts to
$249 16, arising from excess of per capita
tax and unexpended appropriations. This
announcement was received with great
applause.
In its report the library committee â H.
Enkle, chairman; Max Goldberg and Wal
lace A. Wise â gaid: "We are pleased to be
able to state that the library is constant
ly widening its sphere of usefulness, and
that its patronage is steadily on the In
crease. The committee has purchased all
books on Jewish subjects obtainable. Dur
ing the year many valuable additions
have been made to the reference depart
ment. A set of works on the natural sci
ences has been added, and these, taken
with the encyclopedic and educational
volumes on hand, constitute a working li
brary sufficient for the requirements of
advanced students."
The treasurer of the library committee
showed receipts of $2005 83 and disburse
ments of $1997 74. There are 10.572 vol
umes In the library and the circulation
during eleven months was 22,321.
The officers for the ensuing year will
be elected to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock. Lucius L. Solomons will un
doubtedly be chosen grand president and
George Samuels first vice president. There
is considerable friendly rivalry for the
position of second vice president, which

ganized.
The thirty-seventh annual convention of
District Grand Lodge No. 4, I. O. B. 8.,
met yesterday morning at B'nal B'rith
Hall on Eddy street. More than one hun
dred and twenty-live delegates, represent
ing subordinate lodges from all parts of
the Pacific Coast, were present when Grand
President Sig Sichel called the meeting to
order. After roll call and the presenta
tion of acceptance of credentials the fol
lowing appointments of special commit

In his annual address Grand President
Slchel reviewed the year's history of the
district, which shows a net gain in the
membership both beneficiary' and non
beneflclary.
"This increase," said the president, "Is
due to the accession of three new lodges
and the rehabilitating of another at Spo
kane. The pioneer lodge in Idaho was
organized at Boise City on November 28,
1899. Two lodges were also instituted at
Baker City, Or., and at Los Angeles."
The afternoon session was principally
devoted to the reading of official reports,
all of which, proved the order to be in a
flourishing condition. Grand Secretary
Aschheim's report showed the net present
beneficiary membership 'of District No. 4
to be 2073; non-beneficiary, 353. The three
Youths" Auxiliary Lodges have 121 names
enrolled. There is the sum of $120,630 03 to
the credit of the widow and orphan bene
ficiary fund, against which there are un
paid benefits amounting to $16,000.
Following is the recapitulation of re
ceipts and disbursements of the subordi
nate lodges for the .year 1599:
Balance of assets. December 31, IS9S, J90.598 21;
receipts during 18S9, $111,644 Â»2; total. $202,243 13.

and $$8,013 3S expended during last year,
leaving a balance of $404 69.
The report of Grand Trustees Simon'
Hochstadter, Max Marcuse and Julius

has the sum of $IS,4.'U 02 to its credit in
various banks, besides real estate on
Twenty-eighth and Noe streets and a iot
on Natoma street,- on which the trustees
believe it is now an inopportune time to

claring 4 per cent dividends besides mak
ing many improvements:

NEARLY three hundred fair
members of the League . of the
Sacred Heart crowded the La
dies' Sodality chapel attached to
St. Ignatius Church yesterday and
participated In the solemn consecra
tion of the statue of the Sacred
Heart. The occasion was an impor
tant one and was marked with fervent
prayer, beautiful music and an elo
quent sermon.
Services were conducted by Rev.
H. A.oods, S. J., the zealous . and
learned spiritual director of the league
in San Francisco. An appropriate
song by the choir opened the cere
monies, after which prayers were of
fered. Father Woods then ascended
the pulpit and delivered an earnest
talk on the significance of the statue
and"the~reasons why It should be rev
erenced by members. He called atten
tion to the manner In which the
hands were uplifted to heaven In
supplication, and used this point to
emphasize that Christ pleaded for
their knowledge of his divine heart
and the love In which he holds man
kind.
At the conclusion of his strong ad
dress Father Woods read a number of
prayers and blessed the statue with
holy water. The services were con
cluded with the singing of a hymn.
The statue is a rare work of art by
Delen Freres, the celebrated Parisian
sculptor. It stands five feet high' and
represents Christ pleading to human
ity for their love. It Is Tlch In color
ing and Is a striking work of its kind.
It has been placed Immediately over
the tabernacle and adds beauty to the
handsome anDointments of the altar.SAX FRANCISCO CALL.

stone, the various fire clays, asphaltum
and all kindred Interests of the mineral
and metallic classes: to secure better
recognition of the mining industry in the
national Government ana to bring about
needed changes in the Federal mining
laws."
Now Shasta County has a "scrip" war
in which miners alone are contending.
The Mountain Copper Company has for a
good while been steadily acquiring mining
claims all about Its big Iron Mountain
copper mine, looking well to the future
and planning to greatly extend its mining
operations. But recently it began an ef
fort to secure 7900 acres as agricultural
land. It bought forest reserve rights and
located them on selected tracts to the ex
tent stated In the name of General Man
ager Louis T. Wright. Miners of the
whole region fiercely protested that the
lands were In a mineral belt, were min
eral and should be kept in the mineral
domain. One hundred and fifty men
gathered at a meeting In Shasta a week
ago and effected an organization to fight
the company's proceeding, which they
vigorously denounced. Whatever be the
merits of the controversy it Is a small
thing compared with the enormous
amounts of mineral land in that'northern
region which the railroad company has
secured patents to and which it is still
selecting for patent.
A special correspondent of the Mining
and Scientific Press has rediscovered
Mark Twain's original of "Truthful
James" up among the rich pocket mine*
of Jackass Hill, that classic old camp near
the Stanislaus, in Tuolumne County.
James Gillis of Sonora Is the said original
and he Is the principal proprietor of
things about Jackass Hill. Tne hill Is
honej'combed with old and new "coyote
hole' r shafts, and it is reported
that "thirty men are ai work on
this historic eminence. In one of the
Gillis mines the persistent searchers for
wealth are down ISO feet, which is about
as deep as any shaft was ever sunk on
the hill. The slate formation is traversed
with narrow ledges of quartz and these
ledges expand in spots to heavily mineral
ized chunks, from which quantities of free
gold are taken. One pocket thrown out
by a blast a few years ago yielded $45,000.
Within the past two weeks two pockets
containing $2000 have been extracted."
The mining regions are beginning to
worry about lack of rain and snow again.
The-two preceding dry years dealt a very
hard blow to the mining industry, and
when the heavy rains and snows of last
fall and early winter came all looked for
ward to a full water supply and an excep
tioiiully prosperous season. It has not
kept on snowing and the snows are pretty
well gone In tho Sierras, which means
low streams for the summer if the supply
is not replenished. The mining industry
needs heavy spring storms.
Alpine County has long- had a "lost
arrastre" mystery and a lost mine that
goes with It, and with the other lost mines
of the Pegleg sort and recent mining
activity near has revived
speculation about it again. It was away
oft* in the mountains somewhere and has
been seen by cattlemen In the past. It is
supposed to have been burled by detritus
brought down by a cloudburst.
The remarkable quartz crystals of great
size and clear quality which have been
taken from the Green Mountain mine In
Calaveras Countyhave netted the ownei
$17,000 so far. They are found in the
gravel along the rim of the burled ancient
channel which this drift mine penetrates.
Tiffany of New York has taken the prod
uct and cut the crystals into precious
balls, in which form they meet readiest
sale as ornaments, the value of such a
ball being sometimes thousands of dol
lars. These California crystals will form
a leading feature of Tiffany's display at
the Paris Exposition. The mine is now
being worked for gold, but the deposit of
crystals will be worked in the future as
the opportunities of the market allow.
A Fish Commisisoner in Tuolumne
County has caused contemptuous snorts
and surprised opposition by serving no
tice on mill owners to keep out of the
streams tailings, which do not agree with
fish, the said fish being protected by
statute from any lime, gas, tar, coccu
lus indicus, sawdust, mill refuse, etc.,
deleterious to fish. The Calaveraa Citi
zen vigorously opposes closing down the
mother lode mines or ccoking mill tall
ings for the benefit of "a few fish."
Another big low-grade mining enterprise
will be that orf the Royal Consolidated
mines at Hodson, in Western Calaveras
County. There is a great amount of low
grade ore which is cheaply mined, and for
a good while forty stamps have been
steadily and profitably dropping In the
present mill. It has been decided to add
a new 120-stamp mill, giving 160 stamps.
A new oil company having 640 acres
of land has placed its capital stock at
$640,000.
More rich strikes of water are being
made in the desert region and especially
about Randsburg, where a good deal of
boring is going on. One large flow was
struck at 150 feet, and near Goler the
Yellow Aster Company has just struck
a supply which was not affected by pump
ing 200,000 gallons in a day.
The number of oil derricks in Los An
geles City is steadily increasing. For the
last quarter of 1899 municipal license was
paid on 661 derricks.
. Secretary Strasburg of the Oil Storage
and Transportation Company of Los An
geles places the Btock of oil on hand in
the Los Angeles district at 12,000 barrels,
and estimates the present production of
Southern California as follows: "I do
not think the present production of oil
south of Tehachapi will reach 200,000 bar
rels a month. A liberal estimate would
be: Los Angeles, 3500 barrels a day. or
105,000 barrels a month; Fullerton, 15.000
barrels a month: Whittier. 15,000; Puente,
10,000, and Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties, 60,000."
Mining progress is steadily bringing the
low-grade and base ores of the Mohave
desert region into availability. At Victor,
San Bernardino County, the Rose Gold
Mining Company is now mining, milling
and cyaniding ore at a total cost of
$2 24 per ton, the cost of mining being
$1 19 per ton.
At the Oneida mine, Amador County,
the new shaft has reached a depth of
2000 feet,' where a station has been cut
and drifting on the rich ore body begun.
Six hundred feet of water has been
pumped from the old shaft, which Is being
unwatered.
An El Dorado County exchange says:
"From the monthly clean-up made at the
Union mine yesterday 200 pounds of gold
at a value of $40,000 were secured. The
expenses of running this mine are from
$30(30 to $4000 a month, so the net profit
i<* considerable. The value of the ore from
this mine averages from $200 to $700 per
ton Tlaere Is any quantity of ore valued
at $14 per ton, but no attention is being
paid to that now." Â¦ -
The mining regions of the State will
send a good many mining men to try
their luck at Cape Nome this spring.
The company which has been operating
two big gold dredgers on the banks of
the American River, above Folsom. will
remove them to the Mokelumne River,
near Clements, in Calaveras County,
where large tracts of placer ground have
been bought. ,
The eighty stamps at the Gwin mine are
crushing 10,000 tons of ore per month.
J > v?< I .' r\*_N IV i .
DURING the week John M. Wright,
chajpnan of the mineral lands com
mittee of the California Miners'
Association, has received from
many quarters much indorsement
and encouragement for the pro
posed new law protecting oil miners in
prospecting on public lands by applying
the principle of the tunnel location law
to the oil Industry.
As under existing laws and decisions no
mining claim is a valid one and no land
mineral land until a "discovery" of min
eral has been made, and as petroleum can
seldom be discovered without the expendi
ture of time and money for boring, tbe
proposed law is obviously Just from every
point of view, and would interfere with
no rights except the technical and unjust
right of a "scripper" or other agricultural
claimant to get mineral land for mining
purposes by calling it agricultural an.l de
nying, for purposes of acquirement, the
existence of the mineral he seeks. Under
the proposed law one may locate a placer
claim in a supposed oil belt and may hold
the land pending discovery if he proceeds
with proper diligence.- The law, which
was framed by a joint committee com
posed of the mineral lands committee of
the California Miners' Association and a
committee of leading oil men, and which
included John M. Wright, Surveyor Gen
eral Gleaves, Curtis H. Lindley, W. H. H.
Hart. W. S. Keyes, A. S. Cooper, Messrs.
Canfleld, Jones and others, is as follows:
An act to amend the petroleum act, approved
by the President February 11, 1597, so that the
same shall read as follows:
Section 1. That any person or association
of persons authorized to enter lands under the
mining laws of the United States, may enter
and obtain patent to lands containing petroleum
or other mineral oils or other hydrocarbons,
and. chiefly valuable therefor, under the pro
visions of the laws relating to placer mineral
claims; provided, the locaters of placer mineral
claims believed to contain petroleum or other
mineral oils or other valuable hydrocarbons,
shall have three months from and after the
marking of their claims on the ground within
which to begin work for the purpose of com
pleting discovery, and such discovery when
made while working the claim with reasonable
diligence, Ehall relate back and have effect
nunc pro tune as though made before or at the
time of marking the claim on the ground. No
adverse rights to any part of the claim can be
acquired by other parties within said period
of three months, nor thereafter while work
thereon Is being prosecuted with reasonable
diligence: but failure to prosecute work for
clx months shall be considered as an abandon
ment of the claim and failure to begin work
within said ierlod of threa months ehall work
a forfeiture of the claim.
When any location is made on surveyed
land the filing of a verified copy of the notice
of the location in the local land office within
twenty days after the marking of the claim
on the ground, shall operate to withdraw the
claim from entry, and failure to bo file such
notice shall work a forfeiture of the claim.
Provided lands containing such petroleum,
or other mineral oils, or other hydrocarbons,
which have heretofore been filed- upon, claimed
or improved as mineral, but not yet patented,
may be held and patented under the provisions
ot this act the same as If such filing:, claim
or improvement were subsequent to the date
of the passage hereof; and provided, the cwn
ers of such locations made before the passage
of this Ret ehall have three months from and
after the approval thereof, within which to
file verified copies of the notices of their loca
tions in the local land office, and failure to so
file such notices shall work a forfeiture of their
Sec. 2. This act shall not apply to the Dis
trict of Alaska.
A typical response received by Mr.
Wright during the week is that of C. C.
Wright of Los Angeles, who says: "I
have given the bill a careful reading and
it has my very warm indorsement. If such
a bill can be enacted it will put at rest all
the questions which are now vexing those
who are seeking honestly to develop oil
lands. We ought to make a strong pull
and a pull all together for the enactment
of this bill, riease let me know if there
is anything I can do to further the cause. '
The bill will be sent to Washingt*. 1 for
Introduction by some member of the Cali
fornia delegation this week, and it will be
backed by strong influences. A somewhat
similar but less valuable bill has been in
troduced by a Wyoming representative.
As the measure is of interest only where
portions of the remaining public domain
are oil-bearing it will arouse no class or
sectional opposition, and any opposing ar
guments by those interested in acquiring
public oil lands in deserts as agricultural
lands will necessarily be weak.
The outlook for mining legislation in
Congress has wonderfully brightened dur
ing the present session. When California
proposed a governmental department de
voted to mining. several years ago. there
were few answering echoes. Proposed
mining legislation of all sorts received lit
tle attention or favor. The Land Office
was hostile until Hermann succeeded
Lameroux. The industry was not an or
ganized force and was not heard and felt
as a unified interest. It was not of enough
consequence to command great prestige.
Now it has awakened to a wonderful
new development. It is rapidly approach
ing an output of an annual billion in raw
material. Its stupendous future possibil
ities are being clearly seen and Its enor
mous significance in the industrial and
commercial life of the nation is being ap
preciated. It is cutting a large figure in
the foreground of the nation's great
Western advance which is stirring the in
terests of the world. So it ia not co
strange that one of the bills creating a
Cabinet department of mines and min
ine has Just won the victory of a favor
able report from a House committee. The
chances of its passage by this Congress
are uncertain. When it becomes the pres
ent issue in House and Senate it will meet
opposition and its outlook may be seen
to need two or three more .years pf
brightening, but Uncle, Sam will surely
have a Secretary of Mining before very
long. Probably the people after a Secre
tary of. Commerce and Industry will have
to be dickered with. But the scheme will
receive far more favor than even a year
af Thls condition gives encouragement for
the mineral lands bill, for the petroleum
bill, for the revision of mining laws and
other measures for the benefit of the
m The"' report of the Federal engineers
composing the California Debris Commis
sion at last formulating an Impounding
scheme calls for $800,000 for proposed re
straining barriers in the Yuba River and
as but $500,000 has been appropriated by
nation and State for the work California
has a $300,000 appropriation to go to work
for.
Very active preparations for the third
annual meeting of the International Min
ing Congress in Milwaukee, June 19-23, are
being made by the executive committee,
and the meeting promises to be the larg
est and most important convention of
mining interests yet held. Over 1000 del
egates will be named by Governors and
organizations Invited to send representa
tives and over 100 technical and scientific
experts have already signified their in
tention to be present. California should
be and probably will be well represented.
Organized effort to do something for the
great mining industry began with the
California Miners' Association in 1892, and
and its work and example have been the
chief factors in getting the mining Inter
ests to work together for the industry.
The mining men of the West and the
Congressional delegations from the West
have up to now accomplished what has
been done without the co-operation of the
coal iron copper -and other mining, inter
ests'of the East. Holding the congress at
Milwaukee will awaken Interest in the
East and draw those forces into active
co-operation. The influence of this con
gress will be a big force in aid of the
mining legislation asked of Congress, and
which chiefly originated in California. It
is good to see newly permeating the in
dustry the spirit, hope and confidence re
flected in a recent address .by the ex
ecutive committee as follows:
"A new commerce, a new policy, a new
destiny and a new purpose for being and
living confronts 75,000,000 of people, and
the greatest factor in promoting the
wealth and the power of this country is
the mining industry that is the power of
this country. It is the mining Industry
that is the power that will most easily,
naturally .'and permanently build up our
foreign trade, restore prosperity among
the people and lay a firm financial
foundation for the present and future
generations. It la therefore urged that all
earnest scientists, metallurgists and prac
tical mining and mill men, manufac
turers of mining machinery and all others
interested in advancing the welfare of
this nation attend and participate In the
deliberations of this coming session of the
International Mining Congress, and by
their presence, Â¦ instruction and advice
make the proceedings of this assembly so
interesting and so educational in their
character as to command favorable con
sideration throughout the civilized world.
It is not the object of -this congress to
confine Its considerations alone to that of
mining for gold and silver and their, by
.jprod.uc.ts, but that of Jrpn, coal^ marble^

ADAMS FLED HASTILY
TOWARD SANTA CLARA
The following details regarding the
flight of Adams after the tragedy, and his
account of the shooting, were received
last evening In a dispatch from San Jose:
Gilbert Adams was arrested at Santa
Clara at 7 o'clock this evening by Deputy
Sheriff Louis Dosse as he was leaving the
train that had Just arrived from San
Francisco. He was placed in Jail here,
and to-night appears in good spirits. The
following is his account of the shooting:
"The death of Kepner was an accident,
as I had no Intention of killing him. The
whole trouble was caused by the porter,
who has been lying about me' for some
time.
"A short time ago the shop was reduced
from a 15-cent to a 10-cent place, and It
seems that the porter had been trying to
'knock' me by telling the proprietor that
I had been injuring the shop by such
practices as using dirty towels and a
cheap quality of perfume. Last Friday I
had some trouble with the porter, and ex
pected to be fired at once, but Kepner said
nothing to me until to-day at noon. We
walked home togetner last nig~t. as I
boarded with him, but he said nothing
then. To-day at noon he told me I had
better look for another job.
"I said all right, and went for the valise
in which I kept my tools. In this valise
was a 32-callber revolver, and I took It
out and put it in my pocket. Then I went
to Harry Knowles" cigar stand, near the
shop, and left a couple of coats there md
went back to the shop- to talk the affair
over with Kepner. I told him the stories
about my running the shop down were not
so. and Kepner said he believed them be
cause he had been told so by two custom
ers. We got into a heated argument over
the tales, and I finally told him they were
a pack of lies.
Kepner advanced toward me In a
threatening manner and said: 'Don't you
dare to call me a dâ d liar, Gâ d dâ d you!"
I pulled out the revolver to run a bluff on
him and told him to keep away from me.
He told me I couldn't run any bluff on
him, and kept advancing. I retreated and
fell backward on account of getting my
feet caught in a stool. As I fell he Jumped
on me and the revolver went off whllo he
was striking at me, killing him. When
the shooting occurred two or three per
sons rushed In and Harry Knowles took
the revolver.
"I was bareheaded and went to Kep
ner's.house to get my hat. At first I In
tended to give myself up to the police, but
finally concluded to go to Santa Clara to
see my brother George. I walked to Valen
cia street and found there was no car
there. Then I walked to MUlbrae and
caught a car. I was arrested as I was
leaving the train."
While Dosse was taking Adams to his
brother's house the horse became fright
ened and ran away throwing both men
from the buggy and bruising them both
slightly. . Adams received several super
ficial wounds on the scalp, and now claims
that they were inflicted by Kepner In f .hrlr
struggle before the revolver was dis
charged.

"JIM" QUINN
WITH A FORK
Well-Known Turf Followers
Do Battle in an Ellis-
Street Saloon.
QUARREL BEGAN OVER A BET
Principals and Friends Vainly En
deavor to Keep the Affair Prom
Knowledge of the Police.
During a row In Peln Bros.' saloon at
Ellis and Powell streets Saturday night
"Jim" Quinn, the well T known horseman,
was stabbed in the back and leg by "Ed"
Carey, also a horseman. The- weapon used
was a two-pronged fork, which Carey
picked off the lunch counter. For somo
reason the proprietors of the saloon did
all in their power to keep the news of the
cutting from the police.
The Peins, as well as the bartenders,
professed Ignorance of the affair, even de
nying that Qjilnn had been in the saloon.
From an eye-witness, however, the police
learned that Quinn and Willie Shields, the
Jockey, were in the saloon when Carey en
tered. Quinn Immediately started a row
with Carey, declaring that Carey had
given him the "double cross" on a certain
race, and, losing his temper. Qulnn picked
up a bottle of whisky that was standing
on the counter and .brought It down on
Carey's head. Although stunned from
the effects of the blow, Catey grabbed his
assailant and forced him over to the lunch
counter. Picking up the fork, he Jabbed
Qulnn In the leg and also in the back.
The wounded man at once released his
hold on Carey and fell into the arms of
one of his friends. Several bystanders
then Interfered, and after disarming Carey
led him from the saloon. Qulnn was im
mediately hustled Into a hack and driven
to his home. Several hours after the cut
ting Police Officer Keyes found him in
his room, attended by a physician. Qulnn
admitted that he had been stabbed, but
refused to give the name of his assailant.
He claimed he did not know the man, and
informed the officer that he would not
prosecute the stabber, even if the police
succeeded In establishing his Identity.
Carey was on the streets as usual yes
terday, but refused to discuss the affair.
He, however, confided to a friend that he
was forced to stab Quinn, as he feared
that the latter was about to kill him.
Just what the trouble was that precipi
tated the row Is not known except by the
two men. A friend of Carey's says that
Qulnn was angered at the'fork wielder on
account of some bet which ho Influenced
Quinn to make, and threatened to get even
with him. To-day an effort will be made
by the police to induce Quinn to swear to
a complaint against Carey.

The funeral services over the body of
the late A. P. Ilotallng were held at 10
o'clock yesterday morning in the Ma

hall of the Masons was crowded to the
doors, not only by the relatives and asso

presence to the grief they felt in the loss
of one who had always proved himself a

been left behind by the man; over whose
body it became : his sad fraternal duty.
Washington Eulogized.
Taking his text from Acts, vli:3s. "The
same did God send to be a ruler and de
liverer," Rev. Dr. E. A. Woods preached
an eloquent sermon last evening at the
First Baptist Church "on "A Tribute to
the Character of Washington." He slated
that the great American laid the founda
tion of our national distinction and that
in his addresses are to be foun.i the
germs of our institutions. In regard to
Washington's military prowess. Dr.
Woods declared that Frederick the Great
showed his acumen when he asserted that
one of the American general's campaigns
was the most brilliant of the century.
"His dignity and courtesy were shown,"
nald the preacher, "when on. receiving a
letter from Sir Henry Clinton addressed
to Mr. Washington he remarked that Mr.
Washington meant a Virginia planter and
that the letter should be given him after
the war. Bowing the knee to no man, he
was a devout Christian and always knelt
reverently in the house of God. We can
not revere the memory of such a man too
strongly." . ;,. ::'[Â¦Â¦.

the saloon at the time were a number of

arose between a man named Fred Flynn
and Martin Vanderow over the Bper war.
Flynn's sympathies were with the farm

fight in which Flynn used a beer glass
with such good effect as to send Vanderow
to the City and County Hospital, where

were watching for some chicken thieves

Scene of the Shooting and Sketches of the Principals.
Adams was the under man. As they lay
there In each other's embrace Kepner
hissed between his teeth that Adams had
attempted to break up his home and that
he was glad to get rid of him. Adams
struggled to get his revolver from his hip
pocket and finally succeeded In drawing
the weapon. As soon as Kepner saw the
gun he jumped away from his ex-employe,
shouting to the porter to take the pistol
away from him. Patterson made an at
tempt to do so, but was brushed aside by
Adams, who renewed the assault.
The two men grappled again, and Tvhat
immediately followed is not quite clear.
The shooting was witnessed by a man
named Dan Brooks, who was standing In
the doorway "of the shop, when his atten
tion was attracted by loud talking inside.
As he entered he saw Kepner and Adams
struggling. He noticed that Adams had a
revolver In his hand and attempted to
take it from his. Adams turned on
Brooks and threatened to "fill him full of
lead" if he did not mind his own business.
Brooks made a rush for the door, and as
he ran he heard a pistol shot and turn
ing saw Kepner fall to the floor. Adams,
minus his hat, hurried from the shop in
the excitement and disappeared up Stock
ton street before any one thought to de
tain him. He went direct to the home of
Kepner, 591 Geary street, where he had,
been residing. He passed Mrs. Kepner as
he entered the house, but did not Intimate
to her what had hapoened. After chang
ing his clothing and drinking the contents
a flask of whisky he departed.
Mrs. Kepner said that as soon as she
saw Adams enter the house withouC his
hat she had a presentiment that some
thing had happened to her husband. Ad
ams got a hat and left the house, but
after walking about half a block returned
and changed his clothes. She asked him
what had happened, but he evaded her
question and hurried away. As soon as
he left she went to his room In search of
his revolver. â¢ .
"When 1 saw that it was gone," she
8a1d,. "1 knew at once that Gil had shot
my husband." While admitting that her
husband was very jealous of her, sho as
serted that nothing had occurred between
her and Adams to Justify Kepner's sus
picions.
Kepner's porter admitted with much
reluctance that Adams had been dis
charged for attempting to ruin Kep
ner's business, ana that a row im
mediately ensued, during which Adams
drew his revolver and shot his for
mer boss. He also Intimated that
tne men had indulged In words over
Adams' attentions to Kepner's wjfe. the
latter accusing his ex-employe of having
attempted to break up his home.
When the detectives pressed the wound
ed man for a statement at the Receiving
Hospital he replied that his wife knew
all about it and could explain the affair
if she saw fit to do so. She was pres
ent, but refused to make a statement and
would not allow her husband to open his
lips.
Kepner was shot through the left lung,
Just above the heart, and the attending
physicians say that' his chances of recov
ery are but one In a thousand. The po
lice believed that Adams would make his
way to San Jose, where he has relatives,
and notified the authorities of that city
ES. KEPNER, proprietor of a bar
ber shop at 44 O'Farrell street,
was shot and probably fatally
â¢ Injured yesterday afternoon by
Gllbert Adams, one of his em
ployes. Although the shooting occurred
In broad daylight, at the barber shop, In
one of the busiest sections of the city,
Adams managed to make his escape and
was not caught until late last evening,
when he was arrested at San Jose.
There are two versions as to the cause of
the trouble. One Is that Adams sought
revenge for having been discharged ear
lier In the day, and the other Is that the
assailant's undue attentions to Kepner's
wife led to the discussion that culminated
In bloodshed.
From the: evidence at hand It Is more
than likely that Kepner discharged Ad
ams because he had learned that the lat
ter had made proposals to Mrs. Kepner
which might have resulted In the break-
Ing up of the Kepner household. Kepner s
friends, however, assert that Adams had
been endeavoring to Injure his employer's
business with the Intention of getting him
to sell it out at a figure far beneath its
real value.
Both men were at work as usual yester
day, and there was apparently no friction
until after the noon hour, when the por
ter, John Patterson, complained to Kep
ner of something Adams had done. Kep
ner at once told Adams that he had had
enough of him and that he could pack his
things and go. One word led to another,
and the two men grappled. As they
struggled around the shop they fell over
one of the chairs and rolled on the floor.
VERY, VERY FUNNY.

Fair Representatives Hint at

Expected.
If Mrs. Nettie R. Craven row on the
witness stand this morning when the Cra
ven-Fair case Is called In Judge Troutt's
department of the Superior Court Bhe will
be given a warm reception by the attor
neys lor the Fair end of the litigation. It
Is their Intention, as outlined by one of
their representatives last evening, to
probe the Sausulito marriage ceremony
to the bottom. Unless they make radical
changes in their plane before court opens
the arrest of the piaintiS for perjury and
attempted bribery will be demanded..
The cross-examination will follow the
line of tne Sausalllo incident, and if Mrs.
Cravbn- reiterates in the lace ot ail that
&as transpired what she has already tes
tified to concerning the marriage cerc
znony alleged to have been performed by
: Justice of the .Peace SiaijJton it is the in
tention of the Fair interests to place het
In a position where er.c will be lorced to
defend herself on a charge of perjury-
That is the plan, aJUiough it may be
changed. Such action it> invited by the
Craven Hide of the controversy. Attornej
Lafe Pence has said it was the duty of
the Fair attorney & to hand Mrs. Craven
ever to the authorities if they thought for
*.r. instant that the last bimpton amdavit
bore the earmarks of the truth.
"Instead of takir.g that man Simpton In
a, hack to Judge Hunt's home to swear to
that affidavit. " said Mr. Pence, "It was
their sworn duty to take him to the Dis
trict Attorney and demand Mrs. Craven's
arrest for perjury and bribery on the
strength or his statement. That would
ihave been the proper thing to do If they
fc&d faith in their man."
Another Item which may prove sensa
tional Is the Intention of the Fair attor
neys to delve into every detail of Mrs.
-Craven's past life. Their detectives nave
been working on those lines for some v'me,
*nd they claim they have unearthed many
Interesting incidents In Mrs. Craven'r- ca
reer and that it will annoy her somewhat
to explain them away. They assert they

Fiand under close Investigation. A nixr.s
er-on of the Craven camp evolved a sei.s?i
tiunal yarn concerning an attempt to put
the woman out of the way by the carbon
monoxide route, which caused even the
Craven attorneys much merriment.
Sylva. the Sausalito attorney, wli > is
now looked upon with suspicion by every
one directly connected with the case, is to
the fore with a statement that he holds
Mrs. Craven's contract. Indorsed by her
fron-in-iaw, Henry Koehler Jr.. agreeing to
pay him $30,000 for engineering the Sirup
ton conspiracy. Attorney Knight, repre
senting the Fair interests, admits that
Kooh'.er'e signature to the agreement Is
not genuine. No one has been found who
has seen the contract except Sylva, and
he refuses to expose it to the gaze of
curious eyes.
Sylva is also reported to have said that
he had two men hidden In a room adjoin
ing that In which Mrs. Craven Is sad to
have made her $10,000 offer to Justice
Bimpton who overheard the whole conver
sation, and that he will testify to what
occurred there when the proper time
arrives. The pair who were to be trotted
out for this purpose are said to be Consvi
ble Creed and his brother of Sausalitu.
The men have "bucked over the traces,"
however, within the last day or two ani
are giving Sylva considerable uneasiness
by intimating that if he did not treat them
properly they would tell something that
would make things lively for him.
