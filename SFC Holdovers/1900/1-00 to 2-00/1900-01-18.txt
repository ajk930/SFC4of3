scouts had, it was stated, some days pre

Potgieters Drift and.it was ascertained
that. General Joubert. was making a for

When Buller- had gained the drift his
first' step was to inform himself as to the
locality, and strength of this position. It
was, he said, about four and a half miles

a Btrong character. Five days have

received the following dispatch from Lord
Roberts, dated . Cape ;Town, January 16,
evening: . , ; ,â¢ ... .
"On the: 15th the Boers, made a deter
mined attack, on French's advance post,
held by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles

Otherwise the situation Is unchanged."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.â The amendments made yesterday by the Senate
Committee on Interoceanic Canals to the House Nlcaraguan canal bill have
been printed and circulated in the Senate. The amendments prove to be
more radical than at first announced by the members of the committee. The
language of the measure Is practically changed throughout and several of
the House provisions are entirely omitted.
The most important omissions are the provisions which are made In the
House bill for the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and for the pur
chase of existing concessions with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the latter pro
vision In the House measure carrying an appropriation of J0.000,000. The
Senate bill also removes many of the limitations of the House bill as to the
persons to be employed in the proposed work. The provision for a commis
sion to act with the Secretary of War is eliminated.
The Senate committee also makes specific provision that the canal shall be
of sufficient size to accommodate vessels of the largest tonnage, and it in
creases the appropriation from $130,000,000 to 1140,000,000.
PALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Jan.
17. â The Call correspondent is Informed to-night by a member of the
L Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate that an understanding exists be
tween the United States and Great Britain under which this Government
may proceed with the construction of the Nlcaraguan canal without ref
erence to the provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. This statement cannot
be confirmed from an administration sodYce, but the probability of its correctness
is Indicated by the determination of Congress to press the bill authorizing the
building of the waterway and of the failure of the administration to push, nego
tiations for the abrogation of the Qlaytsn-Bulwer treaty, or to make any effort
to discountenance the activity of canal advocates.
There Is no doubt that since the negotiations for the abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer treaty failed some months ago, and since the agitation for the con
struction of the canal has been taken up by Congress, a discussion, either offi
cial or unofficial, has occurred between the two governments respecting American
construction of the canal, and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee as
serted that he was satisfied Great Erltaln had given this country assurance that
it need not let the convention of 1850 stand In the way of action. It has been
known by the authorities for a year past that Great Britain was willing to abro
gate the convention on the condition that she received concessions in the Alaskan
boundary controversy. And It Is possible that if she has made the statement
credited to her she has coupled it with the understanding that her rights else
where *will receive consideration in return for her concession.
Under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty the United. States and Great Britain both
declared that they would not assume or exercise dominion over any part of Cen
tral America in connection with the construction of a canal or maintain exclusive
control over the waterway.
Representative Sulzer has prepared an amendment which he will offer to the
Nlcaraguan canal bill when it comes up in the House, requiring that American
labor be employed in connection with the construction of the canal. In explana
tion Sulzer said to-night:
"I favor digging, building and owning absolutely the Nacaragua canal by this
Government, and I want to see the United States go ahead at once without wait
ing for the consent of any other nation on earth. But the work should be done
by American workmen, and no laborer should receive less than $3 per day for
eight hours' â¢work.- There should be no padrone Â»ystem resorted to. It should be
work of American brain, brawn and genius, and every sanitary and healthful pre
caution should be taken in order to protect the health of the workingmen."
acting in co-operation with Buller's ad
vance guard by moving his division In
parallel line on the west.
While Buller's plan of operations has
been maturing General Buller, it may be
presumed, has been hurrying his com
mandoes from the center of his defensive
line of the Tugela to the extreme west.
Some' checks may have been caused by
the knowledge, that the British com
mander might at any moment make a
serious move from Colenso or farther
to the east at Pietermaritzburg or Wee
nan road to Ladysmith.
WARSHIPS TO ESCORT
THE MULE TRANSPORTS
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 17.â 1t is stated
here that there are British warships with
in easy reach of the Mississippi, assigned
to the duty of escorting the mule trans
ports when they. shall have been loaded
with animals from New Orleans for South
Africa. The presence of the warships in
the Gulf waters is said to have been
brought about by advices received at the
British War Office in London to the effect
that. two old hulks had been fitted out by
American sympathizers with the Boers
with the avowed Intention of capturing
and sinking the mule transports as soon
as they left the mouth of the river on
their voyage across the Atlantic. These
advices, it is said, were cabled from Lon
don to Captain Marsham, In charge of the
buying of mules in this country for thÂ©
British army. Captain Marsham to-day
admitted that there were British war
ships within easy call of the river's
mouth, and while not absolutely denying
ALL THREE MEN SLAIN
BY COLONEL COLSON
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 17.â At the
Coroner's inquest all the eye-wltnesse3
of the tragedy yesterday in which three
men were killed testified that Demaree
was killed by Colson. Several witnesses
swore positively that Scott was not the
man who shot first, and described the
man who began the shooting as a tall,
handsome man. who used a long pistol.
This tallied with the description of Col
son and his revolver. â¢
The Coroner s Jury returned a verdict
to the effect that Scott. Julian and De
maree came to their deaths by pistol
shots fired by David G. Colson.
Captain B. B. Golden, who also was
shot by Colson, is very much improved
to-day and the physicians entertain a
hope of his recovery. Golden says that
he was hit by Colson's first shot and that
Demaree was killed by Colson's reckless
ness. Colson passed the night in Jail.
It ib regarded as fortunate that the af
fair had no relation to politics and that
both the principals and two of the dead
belonged to the same political party, so
that the trouble could not be traced to
politics by any sort of reasoning.- it is
believed the affair will have a terrorizing
and yet tranqullizing effect on everybody
The crowds in the city are smaller than
they were any day this week.

General \ Buller's movements to attack
on the west may lead to a counter attack
by the Boers on the east.
Nothing is moie probable than. that. any
Boers there may have been to the east
ward will by this time have been recalled
to Colenso as a center, or possibly fur
ther west, but however deserted Colenso
and Groblers Kloof may have appeared it
Is. absurd to suppose that it has been
evacuated. That their numbers have been
decreased to meet General Buller's ad
vance Is true, and it may -be- part of the
British plan for General Clery's division
to make a second attempt" to cross the
Tugela at this point simultaneously with
Buller's attack on the left.
From the time that the official dispatch
was published last Friday stating that
General Buller had that day seized a port
at Potgieters Drift on the Tugela .River
the censorship has been so strictly main
tained that nothing but mere conjecture
was possible on the course of events. Now
the first real glimpse is afforded of the
week's campaign for the relief of Lady
smith.
When Sir George "White heliographed
that he was "hard pressed" during, the
desperate assault of the Boers on Caesar's
camp last Saturday week, January 5, Bul
ler promptly sent Clery's division down to
the river front at Colenso. His dispatch
said he had sent forward "every available
man," from which it could be inferred
that the bulk of his troops were behind
Chieveley, at Frere, and again behind
that camp at Estcourt. Clery reported
that ho found the trenches full of Boers
in a fortified position, doubly strengthened
since Buller's disastrous repulse of De
cember 14. He did not attempt anything
further than a reconnoissance, his orders
probably being to content himself with a
feint in order to occupy the attention of
the Boers at that point.
Buller himself was hardly prepared for
the advance, which he was contemplating
on an elaborate scale and a strategical
scheme of outflanking his opponent. The
reinforcements he had received since.'he
fell back from Colenso must have' placed
him In command of more than 30,000 men.
General Sir Charles Warren had Joined
him. an officer whose Griqual and expedi
tion years ago earned for him a reputation
of being able to outmaneuver the Boers
in their own peculiar style of fighting and
on their own ground. From Estcourt War

WHY WHEELER
HAS RESIGNED
Given No Active Service
by Otis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.â
No doubt exists In the minds of friends of
Brigadier General Joseph E. Wheeler that
his return from the Philippines in com
pliance with his own request Is due to the
failure St General Otis to give him active
service in the field.
In certain quarters an effort is made to
attribute General Wheeler's return to In
ability to stand the climate and to his
age. In refutation of the former his
friends point to a statement he made after
visiting the American lines:
"The impression that the country is un
healthy Is wrong."
Regarding his age it Is pointed out that
he is only about a year older than General
Otis.
Friends of General Wheeler assert that
politics Is responsible for his failure to re
ceive proper recognition In the Philip
pines. They believe the politics originated
in Washington. Orders to General
Wheeler to return were cabled about a
week ago. War Department officials will
not admit that the general has resigned
and say they expect if he contemplates
tendering his resignation he will do so in
person.
Under the decision of the Judiciary Com
mittee of the House, submitted at the
last session. General Wheeler will have
to stand for a new election in case he de
sires to resume his Congressional career.
He has not resigned his seat, but it Is con
sidered vacant.
The following cablegrams were received
by the War Department from General
Otis to-day:

SPURNANS FARM, NA
TAL, Wednesday, Tan. 17, 9:20
p. m. â I am permitted to wire
that General Lyttelton yester
day afternoon ferried and forded
Fotgieters Drift and seized with
little opposition a line of low
ridges a mile therefrom.
During the night a howitzer
battery was carried across, and
to-day from Mount Alice, near
Swartz Kop. naval guns and
howitzers shelled effectively the
Boer position, which is a strong
one.
General Sir Charles Warren
also to-day crossed the Tugela,
six miles farther to the west,
near Wagon Drift, with a force
of all arms, in the face of a hot
and heavy fire from the Boer
cannon and rifles. He has ef
fected a most satisfactory lodg

Irq a special cable to the Dally !
Telegraph from its war correspond
ent. Mr. Benr.et Burleigh. with the Lady
pmith relief force, was received In Lon
don, giving the important news that both
Buller and Warren have crossed the
Tugela. between Potgieters Drift and
Wagon Drift and have seized a strong po
rition from a mile to two miles to the
north of the river bank. General War
ren. It appears, fought his way across
against a heavy fire.
This is the news that all Great Britain
has been waiting for since last Thursday.
Last night there was evident expectation
That news of importance would come to
relieve the suspense. A great crowd gath
ered at the war office. The Duke of Nor
folk was among those who at half-past
eleven awaited the issuing of a final bulle
tin for the night. At twenty-five minutes
to twelve it was announced that there
was no news for publication, with which
unsatisfactory announcement the anxious
r.ation was forced to go to bed.
This Important news bears out what I
cabled resterday as to the probable plan
of General Butter's campaign. He is
pushing ahead on his left, where he has
Ftrength. It dots not follow that he will
entangle his cavalry and light artlllery
among the upper foothills of the Drakens
btxrg range, in which he will operate.
Thej=e forces may be, and probably are
far away on the right. In fact, it was
stated Tuesday morning that a large col
umn had been pent down to Durban and
were going thence into Zululand for the
purpose of working around on the ex
treme eastern flank and heading for the
Utrecht and Vryheld districts. Unless
they ran cut lrÂ« on the Transvaal com
munications they will find themselves at
or near the Ladysmith and Newcastle
railway. '.
From the Telegraph's dispatch It is evi
dent that General Buller has a strong
force of Boers in front of him. As Gen
eral Littleton's brigade crossed on Tues
day and General Warren's column yester
day, and the shelling of the Boer posi

ble that a great battle will be fought to
day, or perhaps has already started, for
General Culler Is not the man, after the
lesson learned at Colenso, to give the
Boers any more time than he Is com
pelled to do, by reason of the condition of
n!Â« own men, to hurry reinforcements
across the country to the threatened posi
tion. We may therefore hear before many
hours of the result of this battle, In which
not less than 40,000 men will be engaged.

THE EARL'OF AVA, eon of trie
Marquis of Dufferin and Ava,
lately acting on General Sir George
Black Watch charged and the Gortons and
the Seaforths with a yell that stirred the
British camp below rushed onwardâonward to
death or disaster. These accursed wires caught
them round the legs until they floundered ltke
trapped wolves and all the time -the rifles of
the foe sang the song of death In their ears.
Then they fell- back, broken ' and bleeding,
leaving , nearly 1300 *. dead and wounded Just
where thÂ«" broad breast of the grassy veldt
melts Into the embrace of the rugged African
hills, and an hour later the dawn came of the
dreariest' day that Scotland has known for a
generation past. Of her offioers, the flower of
her chivalry, the pride of her breeding, but
few remained to tell the tolaâ a sad tale, truly,
but . one, untainted, with dishonor or smirched
with. disgrace, for up those heights under sim
ilar circumstances even â¢ a brigade of devils
could scarce have hoped to. pass. All that mor
tal man could do the Scots did. They tried,
they failed; they. fell and there Is nothing left
us now but to move In and avenge.
All that.fateful day our men lay closa to tha
Boer, lines' under a biasing, sun. Over their
heads the shots of friends and foes passed with
out ceasing. All day .long the battle raged.
Scarcely could we see the foeâ all that met our
pyey was ' the rocky heights that spoke with
tongue of flame whenever our troops drew near.
Once, our guards made a brilliant dash at the
trenches' and like a torrent their resistless
valor bore all before them . and for a" few brief
moments they got within hitting distance of
the foe. Veil did th'ey, avenge the slaughter
of . the Scots, â¢ the ' bayonets, like tongues jof
flame, passed above or below the rifles' guard
and swept' through brisket and .breast bone.
Out. of -their trenches the guardsmen tossed
the Boerfi, ' as men â¢In English harvest fields
toss the hay ,when the reapers' Â»cythes have
whitened the corn ', fields, and the human
streams were plentiful where the British
guardsmen stood, j Then they fell back, for "the
fire from the heights above them fell thick
as the spume on the surf on ths Australian
rock-ribbed coast.. The Guards bad proved to
the Boers that, man to man, the Briton was
bis master. .".;â¢'
In vain all that day Methuen tried by every
rule he knew, to draw thÂ» enemy; vainly the
Lancers rode recklessly to induce those human
rock limpets to i come out and cut them off.
Cronje knew the mettle of our men and an
ironic laugh played around 'his Iron mouth,
and still he stayed within his native fastnesses;
but death ; sat Â¦ ever at his elbow, for our gun
ners dropped the' lyddite shells and the howl-
Ing shrapnel all along his lines, until the
trenches ran blood, and many of his guns were
silenced. In the valley : behind his outer line
of hills his dead lay piled in hundreds and the
slope of the hill was a charnel house where
the wounded all writhed amid the masses of
the dead, a ghastly tribute to British gun
nery. "When, at 1:20 p. m. on Tuesday, we drew
off to Modder River to report, we left nearly
3000 dead and wounded of grim old Cronje' s
men as a token that the lion of Briton had
bared his teeth In earnest.
The last mails from the Cape brought
numerous accounts of -Magersfontein> but
none bo vivid as this. Julian Ralph, in
the Daily Mail, very bluntly writes of
the Highlanders after the first volley from
the hidden trenches:
They turned and' ran. literally colliding and
climbing over one another in their confusion.
A chaplain forward In the ranks was knocked
down and trampled, as brave a man as any,
yet one who declared that there lived no. man
who would have behaved differently. It Has
been as if the earth had opened; and from a
cleft that ran as far as our men reached, fire
had belched and shot swept the veldt. The
fever of fright lasted only while the men ran
200 yards, and they regained some measure
of order.

JOE PETE SURRENDERS
Willing to Stand Trial for the Murder
. of William Dangberg.
Special Dipjjatch to The Call.
CARSON, Nev., Jan. 17.â Early this
morning Joe Pete, the Indian who mur
dered William Dangberg last September
at Gardnerville, surrendered to William
Johnson and Is confined In the County
Jail In this city. Rewards amounting $llw>
were offered for his capture.
The Indian surrendered under the stipu
lation that part of the reward money be
used for his defense. After the murder of
young Dangberg Pete took to the
mountains, where he has received assist
ance from tribesmen. Last week a posse
of thirty men attempted to capture him
but failed. Attorney Woodburn made ar
rangements for Pete's surrender, as the
Indian could have killed many men In
the attempt to capture him. Pete had
abandoned his rifle and had only, a re
volver. He was tired out and had been
hounded nearly to death. Since the shoot-
Ing Pete has been, he says, ranging be
tween Marklerllle and Antelope. Con
stable Crawford of the latter place has
been looKing for him for several months
and Pete says Crawford nearly overtook
him three or four times. He says they
were very close together anfl while Craw
ford did not see him Pete had the Con
stable covered through the sights of his
rifle and would probably have shot him
had he been discovered.
SENATE TAKES UP
FLOOR SEIZURES
Requests the President
for Information.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â An agreement
was easily reached in the Senate to-day
to take the final vote on the pending bill
fixing gold as the standard of value in
the United States on February 15.
After several days of debate the drag
net resolution regarding the conduct of
the Philippine war was adopted. It was
introduced by Hoar of Massachusetts and
practically adopted as a substitute for
resolutions offered by Pettigrew and
Lodge. Beyond a vigorous speech by
Pettigrew, the resolution aroused no de
biite. as it is within the discretion of the
President to send or not send any of the
information required.
The resolution offered by Hale of Maine
as to the seizure of flour by the British
authorities was adopted, but only after a
spirited debate a:;< 3 after the resolution
had tÂ«Â»en materially amended. Davis.
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Rolatir.ns, made a sharp attack upon the
resolution, but withdrew his objections

Eulzer of New York Refuses to Be

WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.-The House

of the New York Custom-house by Sec
rotary Gage. Sulztr of New York, the
author of the resolution for the investi
gation of Socrr-tary Gage's transaction
with the New York bar.ks. started the ball
rolling by charging that the mandate had
alrr-ady gone forth to suppress it. Sibley,
a Pennsylvania Df-mocrat, formerly .a
radical advocate of free silver, who Is now
out of sympathy with the Democrats in
the Housr-, warmly- commended Gage's
course. These two speeches precipitated
a dflwte which lasted almost three hours.

resolution had gone, had not acted be

SAW CLARK'S MAN
DISTRIBUTE COIN
Sensational Story of a
Witness.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â William C.
Cook and William F. Rector were before
the Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections in the Clark investigation to
day. Cook is an official connected with
the Thomas Cruse Savings Bank of
Helena, and his testimony related solely
to the deposit of money in the bank by
persons who were regarded as representa
tives of Clark in his contest for the Sen
ate.
Rector proved to be a somewhat irre
pressible witness, volunteering more in
formation than he was asked for. He thus
brought the Lt-wis and Clark County
Grand Jury investigation into the com
mittee Inquiry, contrary to the intentions
of the committee, which was not to take
it up at all. The intrusion of the matter
caused the defense, to raise the point as
to whether the charges in connection with
the Grand Jury should be entered .upon,
ana the committee axljounied until Friday
next without deciding it. To take up that
phase of the question would materially
extend the inquiry.
At the outset henator Fauikner said in
behalf of Clark tbaj. the letters written to
him during und since the session of the
L-egislutuie by Dr. Ector had been found
in liutte and were on their way to Wash
ington. Â¦
The iirst witness to-day was Cook, who
was questioned concerning the accounts
of A. J. Davidson and Hon. J. K. Toole
with the Thomas Cruse Savings Bank.
Davidson's account was opened on Sep
tember b, 1S&, and closed on February D,
lÂ£&i<. Davidson was considered a repre
sentative of Clark in the Senatorial cam
paign, and the effort was to show that
Clark's money was being used. Cook said
that from firet to last $21,800 was deposited
in Davidson'E name, and $13,000 of this
amount came into the bank in the shape
of a draft from the bank of Clark &
Brother, Butte, and $3800 on a telegraphic
order of transfer from that bank. He said
the money was all checked out, but he
could not remember to whom any of the
checks were made payable, in the case of
Toole there was an effort to connect hla
withdrawal from the Senatorial contest
with Clark's name, but Cook said he knew
nothing about politics.
Cook had no recollection of any unusual
number of $1000 bills in circulation in
Helena during the winter of IS9B-99. when
the Senatorial contest was on. The der
posit slips in Toole's name showed de
posits in currency amounting to $8763 from
November 3. 18!>S, to July 31, 1599. Darid
scn had been in the commission business,
but had made an assignment.
William A. Rector, who said he was an
expert accountant, was the next witness.
He testified that he had secured rooms in
Helena, to be used during the Senatoriul
contest at the instance of A. J. Stecle,
getting three rooms in the Power block,
which met Steele's requirements, of a
vault and a number of entrances. The?e
rooms the witness described as a "trap"
and said they were used for consulti
tion with members of the Legislature. He
stated that he had seen several members
in the rooms and had heard Steele, David
son and other supporters of Clark discuss
the ways and means of securing votes. He
had seen a sum of money which he
thought was $10,000 paid to one of the
members.
Referring on crogs-examlnatlon to his
relations with Steele, the witness contend
ed that the latter was no especial friend
of hi.s. - . â¢
"The only sign of friendship I ever re
ceived." he said, "was that after he had
bought the Grand Jury he gave me $D 0 to
watch them."
This assertion raised a laugh and also
a point of order, which gave the commit
tee considerable trouble. The committee,
in order to keep the investigation within
reasonable scope, had decided not to en
ter into the Grand Jury investigation. The
information had been volunteered, and
Mr. Faulkner insisted that if it was to
Ftand he should have an opportunity to re
fute it. The committee took the matter
under advisement.-
The witness gave the amounts which
were, according to his information, paid
to the different members of the Grand
Jury.
During the cross-examination a sharp
tilt occurred between ex-Senator Ed
munds and Faulkner, of counsel on the
respective sides of the controversy.
"Don't try to take care of the witness, *
said the West Virginia ex-Senator.
"I will take care of you If you don r t k*ep
within the rules," responded the Vcr
monter.
Chandler, interfered at this point and the
investigation proceeded.
Rector said he was positive that the
member of the Legislature who was pnld
for his vote In the presence of the witness
had put the money In his pocket. He said
this man was one of a number of Repub
lican members who were not to vote im
mediately for Clark â not until "the but
ton was touched."
Replying to Faulkner's efforts to show
Inconsistency between the statements
made to-day and those made in Montana,
Rector explained by saying:
"I have made no study of it, becatise
there was no money in it for me."
"Are Sou certain of that?" asked Faulk
ner.
"Not a dollar," was the reply.
The committee adjourned until PrldÂ«.y
before Rector concluded his testimony.
Correspondence of tha Associated Press.,
LONDON, Jan. 10.â Some of the most
brilliant work In the way of de
scriptive writing ever done by
British correspondents has been
appearing In the British papers in
123456 the last few days. Bennett Bur
lelgh's splendid description of the battle
of Colenso. which was cabled in part by
the Associated Press, is not one bit finer
than the account of Magersfontein by the
correspondent of the Daily News. After
tracing the terrible, loss suffered by the
Highlander brigade at Magrersfontc-in. the
Daily News' correspondent thus writes of
the burial of General Wauehope: Â¦
Three hundred yards to the rear of the little
township of Modder River. Just as the sun was
sinking in a biaze of African eplendor on the
evening of Tuesday, the 12th of December, a
long, shallow grave lay exposed In the breast
of the veldt. In the west the broad river,
fringed with trees, ran murmurinely; to the
eastward the heights Ftlll held by the enemy
ocowled menacingly; north and south the veldt
undulated peacefully. A few pac*s to the north
ward of that grave fifty dead Highlanders lny,
dressed as they had fallen on the field of battle.
They had followed their chief to th* field and
they were to follow him to the grave. How
grim and stern thope men looked as they lay
face upward to the sky. with great handb
clenched in the last death agony and brows
still knitted with stern lust of the strife in
which they had fallen. The- plaids dear, to
every Highland c.an were represented there,
and as I looked out of the distance came the
sound of the piper.. It was the general coming
to Join his men. There, right under the eyes
of the enemy, moved with flow and solemn
tread all that remained of the Highland b^lsade.
In front of them walked the chaplain, with
bared head, dressed in his robes of office; thon
came the pipers with their pipes. Klxteen In all.
and behind tlifm, with arms reversed, moved
the Highlanders, dressed in all of the regalia
of their regiments, and In the midst the dead
senoral, 'borne by four of hw comrades.. â_..',
Out swelled the rit>es to the -strain of. the
"Flowers of the Forest." until the soldiers'
heads went back in hauchty defiance and eyes
flashed through fears like sunlight on steel;
now singing to a moaning wall like- a woman
wailing her first born, until the proud heads
dropped forward till they rested on the heaving
chests and tears rolled down the wan and
scarred faces, and the choking sobs broke
through the solemn rhythm of the march /of
death. Right up to the grave they marched,
then broke away in companies, until the gen
eral lay In the shallow grave, with a Scottish
square of armed men around him. Only the
dead man's son and a small remnant of his
officers stood with the chaplain and the pipers
while the solemn services of the church were
spoken.
Then once again the piper pealed out "Loch
aver No More." It cut through the stillness
like a cry of pain until one could almost hear
the widow In her Highland home moaning for
the soldier she would welcome back no morÂ».
Then as If touched 'by the magic of one thought
the soldiers turned their tear-damp eyes from
the still form in the shallow grrave Â¦ toward
the heights where Cronje, the lion of Africa,
and his soldiers stood. Then every cheek'
flushed crimson and the strong Jaws set. llk*
steel and the veins on the hands that clasped
the rifle handles swelled almost to burstipg
with the fervor of the grip and that - ; look
from tho?e silent, armed men spoke more elo
quently than ever fi>oke the tongues of ora
tors. For on each frowning face the spirit
of vengeance sat and each sparkling eye, asked
silently for blood. God help the Boers when
the. next Highlander pibroch sounds. God rest
the Boers' souls when the Highland bayonets
charge, for neither death nor hell, nor things,
above nor things below will hold the Scots
tack from their blood feud.
At the head of the grave, at the point, near
est the enemy, the general was laid to -sleep,;
his officers grouped around him, while in-line'
behind him his soldiers were laid in a double
row wrapped in their blankets. ' No.
shots were ' fired -over -the â¢ dead ; - men
resting so peacefully. Only the .. sa
lute was given, and then the men marched
campward as the darkness of an African nfght !
rolled over the far-stretching breadth of veldt.
To the centlewoman who bears the general's
name the Highland brigade send their deepest
sympathy. To the members and the wives,
the sisters and the sweethearts in the cottage
homes by hillside and glen they send love and
good wishesâ sad will be their ChriÃtmaa. sad
der the New Tear. Yet. enshrined In every
womanly heart from Queen, Empress to cot
tage girl, let their memory be the memory of
the Highland brigade who died at Magersfon
tetn.
The same writer thus depicts the way
in which the disaster overtook the High
landers: - ; - t
During the night it was considered expedient
that the b!Â« Highland brigade, about 1000
strong, under General "Wauchope, should get
close enough to the lines of the foe to make it
possible to charge the heights. At midnight the
gallant general moved cautiously through the
darkness toward the kopje where the Boen.
were most strongly intrenched. They were led
by a guide who was supposed to know every
inch of the country, out into the darkness of
an African iilght. The brigade marched In line
of quarter column, each man stepping cautious
ly and slowly, for they knew that any sound
meant death. Every order was given in a
hoaroe whisper, and In whispers It was passed
along the ranka from man to man. Nothing
was heard as they moved toward the gloomy,
steel-fronted heights but the brushing of their
feet In tha veldt grass and the deep drawn
breaths of the marching men.
Bo onward until 2 o'clock on the morning of
Monday.- Then out of the darkness a rifle rang
sharp and clear, a herald of disaster. A soldier
had tripped In the dark over the hidden wires
laid down by the enemy. In a secondâ ln the
twinkling of an eyeâ the searchlights of the
Boers fell broad and clear as the noonday sun
on the ranks of the doomed Highlanders, though
It left the enemy concealed in the shadows of
the frowning mass of hills behind them. For
one brief moment thÂ» Scots seemed paralyzed by
the suddenness of their discovery, for they
knew that - : they were huddled together Jlkt
sheep within fifty yards of the trenches of- thÂ«
enemy. Then clear above" the confusion rolled
the voice of the' general, "Steady,' men, steady,"
and like .an echo' to* the veterans out came thÂ«
crash of nearly a thousand -rifles not' fifty paces
from them. The Highlanders reeled before the
spooklike trees before them. The best, their
bravest, fell in that wild hall of lead. . General
Wauehope was down, riddled with bullets, yet,
gasping, dying, bleeding from every vein, the
Hlghfand chieftain raised hlms>lf'bn" his handi
and kneen and cheered his men forward.

PATRICK BOYLE
HELD FOR ARSON
Damaging Testimony of
Two Witnesses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 17.â The prelimin
ary hearing of Patrick Boyle, charged
with arson, took place here to-day before
Judge Rodden, District Attorney Mc-
Isaacs conducted the case for the people,
while Attorney James Cochrane appeared
for Boyle. The trial, which was replete
with sensation, resulted in Boyle being
held on bonds of $4000, which up to late
this evening had not been furnished.
The whole of the morning session was
taken up by the examination of Mrs.
Sheppard, who proved an excellent wit
ness until subjected to a grilling cross
examination by Attorney Cochrane, which
left the testimony of the prosecution's
star witness In a very dubious light. Mrs.
Sheppard was the woman who lived over
Boyle's saloon and who was Instrumental
in righting the llames. She told of her ex
perience on the night of the fire and
seemed to be extremely vindictive toward
Boyle. Other witnesses called by the
prosecution were George Shearer, C. T.
Shader, John McLaugnlin and John J.
O'Brien. Next to Mrs. Sheppard, John
O'Brien, Boyle's bartender, gave the most
damaging evidence. He told of having
seen the large can of oil delivered which
Mrs. Sheppard claimed to have carried
out of the tiames. He stated that he had
never seen so much oil delivered at the
saloon and that Boyle seemed much ex
cited on the night of the fire.
The testimony of other witnesses cor
roborated In the main Mrs. Sheppard's
statement.
Attorney Cochrane sprung a sensation,
when at the close of the testimony he
asked for dismissal on the ground that no
evidence had been offered but Mrs. Shep
pard's, which pointed directly to Boyle as
the firebug. The testimony offered by
Mrs. Sheppard was so vague, said Coch
rane, that it could hardly be admitted as
evidence. Judge Rodden refused to dis
miss the prisoner and held Boyle to an
swer In $4000 bonds.
A dramatic scene occurred after the
decision was rendered. Mrs. Wagner, the
prisoner's stepmother, fell on her knees
before the Judge and the District Attor
ney and prayed them with tears In her
eyes to lower Boyle's bond to $2000. "Let
me take my boy home," she begged.
Another sensation was occasioned when
Mrs. Sheppard, her eyes blazing with
rage, attacked Cochrane. "You dare call
me a liar?" she cried. The courtroom had
emptied at the time and for a few sec
onds it looked as if the infuriated woman
would give Cochrane a bad quarter of an
hour. Luckily for Cochrane, however,
Mrs. Sheppard's' friends led her away be
fore trouble resulted.
Up to late to-night no one had been se
cured to go on Boyle's bond, but Coch
rane is confident of having his client at
liberty to-morrow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1900.
UNANIMOUS AGAINST
POLYGAMIST ROBERTS
Special Committee Divided Only
as to the Method of Excluding
Him From the House.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 17.â The ppecial
oorsmittee of the House of Representa
tives, appointed to investigate the case
Of Brigham li. Roberts of l.'tah, to-day
reached a final conclusion. On the polyg
amous status of Roberts the committee
"was unanimous and agreed upon a formal
Fiatement of facts. On the question of
the procedure to be adopted, the commit
tee was divided.
The majority, consisting of all the mem
bers, except Littlefirld of Maine and De
Artsond of Missouri, favored exclusion at
the outset. .Littlefield and De Armond
will make a minority report favorable
to seating Roberts on his prima facie
"Tights and then expelling him.
The statement of facts found bjv the
committee is as follows:
We flrd that It. 11. Huberts was elected as
c Represent*!!*! ti> the Fifty-fclxth Congress
from the State of I'tah and was. at the date
Of his election, above the age of 25 years; that
ht- had bÂ«*>n f>>r more than seven years a
naturalized citizen of the United States and
wns an inhabitant of the State of L'tah.
We further firnl that about IÂ«7S he married
Ix>uiFa Smith. hi* first and lawful wife, with
whom he has ever since lived as such, and
Tn-h.j, since their marriage, has borne him six
children.
About IÂ«S3 he married, as his plural wife,
Cclia Dibble, with whom he has ever since
jivfd uf such and who. since such marriage,
ha* borne him six children, of which the last
were twins, born August It, l'-ST.
That * one years after hi? *ai<i marrlase to
Cc-lia Dibble he contra 'ted another plural rr.ar
r!ap>- Â¦Riih Margaret C. t=hipp. with whom he
hsi* ever since lived In the habit and repute
Your cor-.mittee If unable to fix the exact
fiate of this marriage. It does not appear
that he held her out a* his wife before Janu
ary 1. 1Â£97. or that before that date she held
him out as her hus=hand. or that before that
date they were reputed to be husband and
â¢wife.
That these facts were generally known In
Vluh and publicly charged against him during
his campaign for election and were not denied
by him; that the testimony bearing on those
facts was. taken In the presence of Mr. Roberts,
and that he fully cross-examined the witnesses,
but declined to place .himself on the witness
ftlilid.
The culminating session of the commit
tee to-day followed many prolonged ex
ecutive sessions which left no doubt as
to the attitude cf the, several members
with the exception of Miers of Indiana,
who had been out of the city. He reÂ»
turned to-day and it was determined to
bring the matter to a direct issue. Ac
cordingly, when the cpmmlttee met, Mc-
Pberflon; of lowa offered a resolution for
the exclusion of Roberts.
De Armond immediately proposed a sub
stitute recognizing the constitutional
ripht of Roberts to take his seat on. his
credentials and providing for his expul
sion.
There was no discussion beyond infor
mal remarks. A vote was first taken on
I>e Arnmnd's substitute. Llttlefleld Join
ing: him in the affirmative, and the others
voting: in opposition. The vote was then
taken on McPherson's motion to exclude,
resulting as follows:
Ayesâ Tayler of Ohio, Frear, Morris and Me
rherson <RÂ«pd.), Lanham and Mlers (Dems.).
Xopbâ Llttiefleld <Uep.). De Armond (Dem.)
Chairman Tayler was authorized to pre
pare the majority report. It will be ready
in a few day?, and the prospects are that
the subject will be broujrnt before th*
House early next week. De Armond will
submit the view of the minority. lie
will include th<* exhaustive review of the
law. covering about seventy type-written
pagrop, prepared by Littlefield. The main
point of this Is that the House cannot add
to the requirements provided by the con
stitution providing for admission to the
House, and that the only constitutional
remedy is to admit and then expel on the
finding of facts.

streperous packing and drying houses will
be erected and the association will handle
the entire output.
The salaried officers are: President, 5500
per month, and three members of the ex
ecutive committee at $3UO per month each.
These are not high, tut yet sufficient to
secure good men.
The convention has been one of the
greatest everÂ«held by any of the fruit In
terests. Over a thousand people nave been
present at each day's session, and repre
sentative growers from all the coast
have participated in the discussions. All
through it the guiding hand of M. Theo
Kearney, the president of the Raisin
Growers' Association, has directed things,
and the success of the convention is due
in a great measure to him.
Over 3t>" growers have already joined
the association, representing about 10,000
acres of prunes.
The meeting to-day was very interest
ing. The election of directors was the
only thing to be done, and the list selected
shows this was done wisely.
At no time has there boon any marring
scenes in the proceedings. But one man
left the convention, and that was Judge
l^ewis, one of the hardest workers among
the growers. His pet hobby was to keep
the credit of the association down to
$25,000, and when it was increased to $200,
l>oo he withdrew. It is said that he now
is ready to come back to the association.
Chairman Bond called the convention
to order at 9 o'clock this morning. The
committee, consisting of Messrs. Sprague,
Hersey and Childs. which was appointed
to draft an answer to the dispatch re
ceived from Herbert Mybrlck. chairman,
of the League of Domestic Producers',
asking that a protest be adopted against
the making of the recent reciprocity
trpaties. reported having forwarded the
following answer:
To Herbert Myrick. chairman of the League
of IVimestic Producers: It is the unanimous
judgment of the California Fruit Growers' A6
t=oc:."itlon. to-day in convention assembled, fhat
th-? pending reciprocity treaties now before Con
gress are Inimical to ihe best interests of Cali
fornia's great horticultural Industry. aj>d we
therefore most earnestly protest agalnet a rati
fication cf said treaties.
H. O. BOND.
â¢ Chairman of Convection.
San Jose, January IS. l-'OO,
M. Theo Kearney thought this was not
sweeping. He thought all reciprocity
treaties should be condemned. While
protecting our own interests we should
also work for the interests of growers
all over the country- An injury to one
class of growers would ultimately be felt
by all.
Colonel Philo Hersey thought that the
message contained all that was neces
sary, and the convention sanctioned the
action of the committee.
L. F. Graham s-tated that Oregon and
Washington, which States had large
prune interests, had* apparently been
overlooked. He thought provision should
be made for subsequent representation of
those States, and offered the following
resolution:
Resolved. That grower* of prunes and other
deciduous fruits of Oregon and Washington be
(ordia-lly invited to co-operate and join with this
association, and that one director be selected
with the understanding that he will resign In
favor of one selected from those States.
This resolution carried unanimously.
The following resolution introduced by
A. R. Sprague received the united sup
port of the growers:
Resolved. That this convention requests the
boatd of directors of this association to arrange
for the organization of subordinate associations
of crowers. in order that such organizations
may promote the work of this association In
districts remote from headquarters by helping
to extend all influences favoring co-operation
and by providing for all needs ot the member
ship of this association which are distinctly
local anj to afford means through which any
protests or complaints or recommendations may
be presented to this association.
Chairman Bond said three hundred
growers had signed membership cards.
The election of directors was next in or
der. It was decided to hear the report
of the nominating committee, and other
nominations that might be made, and
take up the voting as soon as the conven
tion reconvened in the afternoon.
The nominating committee of 21,
through its chairman. W. H. Aiken, re
ported the following for directors: H. G.
Bond. Santa Clara; L. F. Graham San
Jose; F. N. Wood, West Side; H. W.
Meek, San Lorenzo; W. P. Cragln. San
Jose; A. B. Fletcher, Campbell; M. Theo
Kearney. Fresno; J. B. de Jarnette, Co
lusa; Charles Forman, Los Angeles;
Thomas Jacobs, Visalia; TV. E. Woolsey,
Fulton.
W. P. Cragln withdrew and E. T. Pet
titt was named by T. R. Johns for the
directorate. L. F. Graham nominated J.
H. Henry and Senator Thomas Flint of
San Benito County was championed by
W. S. Shelly. Other nominations were R.
W. Hersey, S. R. Johnson, S. P. Sanders,
Jacob Miller. W. S. Griffin.
On reconvening at 1 o'clock several
other nominations were made, among
which were C. W. Childs, A. C. Kuhn and
A. R. Sprague. Mr. Cragin's name was
again presented. Mr. Sprague withdrew
his name and asked that his support be
given to Charles Forman of Los Angeles.
The representation that Santa Clara
County be entitled to In the directorate
was brought up. After some discussion
the following resolution introduced by J.
H. Henry was adopted:
Resolved, That it Is the sense of the
convention that Santa Clara County be
entitled to five directors.
Mr. Kearney deplored the fact that sec
tionalism had entered into the organiza
tion. He thought the directors should be
fleeted at large and no special representa
tion given to any one locality.
W. S. Shelly wanted the selection of di
rectors referred back to the 'nominating
committee and then the directors elected
who were named by the committee.
Kearney seconded the motion. Judge
Bond declared the matter out of order and
the convention decided to elect the five
directors to represent Santa Clara County
tlrst.
While the ballots were being counted
Vice President Akin moved that the sec
retary cast the ballots for the directors
recommended by the committee to repre
sent other sections. This elected the fol
lowing: H. W. Meek, San Lorenzo; M.
Theo Kearney. Fresno; J. B. de Jarnette.
Colusa; Charles Forman, Los Angeles;
Thomas Jacobs, Visalia; TV. E. Woolsey,
Fulton, Solano County.
U. M. Delmas addressed the convention.
HÂ»Â» urged the growers to stand firm to

The ballot for the Santa ClarA County
directors was announced as follows 241
votes being cast: H. G. Bond,- 238; L. F.
Graham. 195; F. N. Woods, 146; J. H
H^nry. 173; A. B. Fletcher. 119. Eight
other candidates received less' than 70
votes each.
W. A. Coulter nominated Judge Bond
for president of. the board of directors.
Mr. Kearney seconded the nomination.
Judge Bond wanted to decline, but the
convention refused to allow him.
J. H. Henry was elected vice-president,
and also made a member of the executive
committee.
The directors were called before the
meeting and introduced. .
M. Theo Kearney was called upon for a
short speech> He urged all the fruit men
to take oft their coats now and go to work
to secure 73 per cent of the growers for
the organization.
After three cheers for the California
Fruit Growers' Association the conven
tion adjourned.

This afternoon was devoted to business
and the reading of a paper entitled "The
Unsolved Problem," by Mrs. I. Lowen
burg of San Francisco. In part she said:
Peoples and religions have come and gone,
empires and nations have risen to civilization
and sunk Into barbarism, the sages or antiquity
and the Roman and Grecian orators with their
word? of gold have passed Into the ares and
their lives would have been naught had they
not left their "footprints on the Bands of time."
Thought is Immortal and can never die, and
the thought of having national and private
workshops for the unemployed will gather
strength as a ball rolling down hill Increases
In velocity, gaining force by its own momentum.
Bo let the approaching twentieth century, with
Its rich heritage of discoveries, inventions, in
tellectual development and liberty of thought,
press forward and practically demand the in
stitution of a well-defined method of obtaining
work for the-tinemployed as the only salvation
cf man and the only solution of the unsolved
problem.
One of the most interesting features of
the convention was the address of Mrs.
Burdette. After bidding the delegates
welcome, she went on to speak of the
importance of unity of action, which
could only be had through federation.
With federation would come a reciproc
ity that women are now suffering from
lack of without realizing it. The develop
ment of isolated clubs would no longer be
limited to the intellectual scope of their
community, but, brought in contact with
clubs of higher purpose and broader work,
the humblest club may find definite Ideals
above and beyond Itself. The city club
would catch from the country club the
originality and freshness of thought that
comes from intimacy with nature in her
unspoiled "mothering" moods. The coun
try club. In communllon with Its city sis
ter, would feel the thrill of Inspiration
SOON TO HOIST THE
FLAG ON TUTUILA
All That Is Lacking Is an Exchange
of Ratification of the Samoan
Treaty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â 1t was stated
at the State Department to-day that the
British and German Governments had al
ready ratified tho treaty for the partition
of Samoa and that exchange of ratifica
tions was the only remaining ceremony to
accomplish the extinction of the trl
dominfon. Secretary Hay will make Im
mediate arrangements for an exchange of
ratifications, which will occur as soon as
possible, probably in Washington.
In anticipation of this ceremony the au
thorities will formulate a proclamation
which will be sent to Commander B. F.
Tilley, commanding the Abarenda, which
he will publish immediately upon receipt.
He will be directed to hoist, the American
flag over Tutuila, Ofoo and Manna and
will perform the functions oft Governor.
Commander Tilley. with the Abarenda,
is now in New Zealand obtaining piling
for the pier under construction in the har
bor of Pago Pago. It will, therefore, bo
an easy matter for the department to
communicate with him. I understand he
will be governor for only a few months.
When he was sent to Pago Pago he re
quested the department to relieve him
during the coming summer. It Is possible
that another ship may be ordered to Pago
Pago to relieve the Abarenda, her com
manding officer to succeed Commander
Tilley as governor. It Is apparent to the
authorities that It will be necessary In
the interest of health and for the diver
sion of the crew to relieve the vessels or
dered to Samoa at short intervals and this
policy will probably be adopted.

that comes from the wondrous planning
and mighty achievements of the busy
world of menâ the glamour and glitter of
social life. The literary, club, with its
calm, cold, intellectual pulse, would
gather warmth and throbbing life from
the philanthropic club, bending all its
womanly energies to lifting burdens from
the souls and bodies of humanity.
Continuing on this line. Airs. Burdette
said:
Our public schools call for women other than
teachers who shall see that physicians are
provided to examine the sight, hearing: and
physical conditions of children with a view to
preventing overstrain â to sec that school sani
tation keeps pace with hygienic progressâ that
should protest against the "study-out-of
school" evilâ to oversee the school luncheon
matter, that is so serious a question In Intel
lectual development of growing children â and
to jealously watch every opportunity for taking
the public school system out of politics and
committing it to the keeping of intelligent men
and women who love home and education first
and personal power and eelf-aggrandizement
last. ,
The preservation of the forests of this State
is a matter that should appeal to the women,
while the women of New Jersey are saving the
Palisades of the Hudson from utter destruction

OF WOMEN'S CLUBS.
structlon, the word comes to ' the women of
California that men whose souls are gangsaws
are meditating the turning of our world-famed
sequoias into planks and fencing worth so
many dollars. Not only for their beauty, their
matchlees grandeur, must our forests be saved,
but for the stronger reason that under their
shadows live the springs of water that give
vitality to seed time and glory to the harvest,
life to ourselves and little, ones, wealth to the
Stute. Our forests are the great natural reser
voirs of the water supply that has made pos
sible our homes, our health and our prosperity.
Lose them and we are In dancer of seeing
again the alkali wastes of the desert. Better
one living tree in California than fifty acres of
lumber yard. Preserve and replant them and
the State of California will be blessed a thou
sand fold in the development of Its natural
resources, which far outvalue those of any
other State over which floats the flag which
keeps us free.
Preformation is better than reformation. It
is easier and better to prevent good people
from going wrong than it Is to make good peo
ple out of bad ones. California is not yet
cursed with slum life, as are the older States.
Let the- women see to it, that these moral
plague spots In the life of the State are not
permitted to rather.
Added to these must be those of our own club
needs, which are by no means leastâ such as
traveling libraries, club extension, reciprocity
bureaus.
ThÂ»se are but glimpses of our possibilities
conditions which are at once our opportunities
and our responsibilities. Woman holds In her
hand no agency of force by which she can ac
complish these objects, but she can attain the
ends by the exercise of her womanly powers if
she remain mistress of her spiritual graces and
refinements. Just In proportion as nations and
peoples have substituted the law of love for
the law of force and have sought to do each
other srood instead of evil. Just In that pro
portion they have come to a higher and bet
ter civilization. As woman becomes distin
guished along the higher lines of progress,
carrying with her greater refinement and cul
ture and bringing a. beneficent Influence on
every Interest with which she comes in con
tact, ruling by the. law of love and not force,
her progress will signify not the degradation
of man but the elevation of womanâ and of
man. And if she by her weakness led him
opt of Eden, she by the strength of her gen
tleness will lead him back again.
To-morrow officers will be elected and
Mrs. Burdette seems to lead in the race
for the first president to be chosen by
the State Federation. The convention ad
journs to-morrow afternoon.
One of the Crew Is
Drowned.
While on her last trip to Sausalito at
about 7 o'clock last night the steamer
San Rafael ran down the fishing smack
Stella, in which were Jimmy Olivero and
Andrea Castagnola, two Italian fishermen
returning home after a day's fishing. As
a result one of the fishermen was
drowned.
The accident occurred off Lombard
street wharf, not far from the end of
the pier. ' When the fishermen saw the
steamer bearing down on them and, real
izing that to stay on board meant that
they would be crushed to death, they
jumped from their frail craft into the
cold waters of the bay and attempted to
swim from the death-dealing paddle
wheel. The steamer was stopped as soon
as the boat was made out in the dark
ness and a boat was lowered to search
for the men.
Castagnola was picked up, but noth
ing could be seen of his unfortunate com
panion, though the search was kept up
for quite a while.
Jimmy Olivero, the drowned man, was
a native of Italy and about 55 years of
age. He leaves a son about 19 years or
age in this city and a widow in Italy.
Andrea Castagnola, the owner of the
boat, lives on Prescott street, a small
alley off Vallejo street, near Sansome.
where he now lies in a very precarious
condition, raving like a maniac.
It is the opinion of many fishermen at
Vallejo street wharf that the fishing
smack was sailing home without showing
any lights and that the San Rafael,
changing her course suddenly, swept
down on the Stella before the fishermen
could avoid her.
Olivero. no doubt, was struck by the
wheel of the San Rafael or was drawn
under the waves by the immense suction
caused by the steamer's speed.
Young Lewis Bulkeley
'" Blind as a Bat."
Lewis E. Bulkley, whose recent
attempt to elope with a factory girl was
frustrated, was suddenly stricken with
blindness last Tuesday morning, and since
then has been under the care of a physi
cian. According to the dictum of the
medico the loss of sight was due prim
arily to the excessive use of cigarette*
and secondarily to the habit of reading
by lamplight after retiring for the night.
Bulkeley came into local fame recently
by his originality in the style of his ap
parel. Appearing on Market street with
broad baruls of purple velvet around the
bottoms of his trousers, the tips of his
coat sleeves and the collar of his coat,
he was the cynosure of all eyes and unan
imously voted the "warmest of them all."
It seems that â¢ Bulk Hey was standing
near the entrance of Dan P. Carter's ciÂ«ar
store when a film came over h.ls eyes, an i
In a short while his sight entirely disap
peared. He summoned a friend and Â«;u
taken home. He has. according to his own
statement, been stone blind for over twen
ty-four hours. This morning the light
began to affect his eyes and he Is now
wearing a pair of goggles.
"I am as blind as a bat." he said last
evening at his rooms in the Wentworth
Hotel, on Bush, near Stockton street. "I
moved from where I was formerly located
on the sth of this month in order to keep
my whereabouts a secret. The physicians
say cigarettes and reading at night are
the cause of my trouble, but I don't think
cigarettes had much to do with It. I can't
see anything now. but the light is begin
ning to hurt my eyes and I am hopeful
that I will soon be all right. See th it
looking-glass there. I cracked It last
night by running my head In the wrong
direction."

VICIOUS ATTACK
ON AN ATTORNEY
Exciting Scene in a
Courtroom.
INSULT PRECIPITATES . ROW
DR. DANZIGER BELABORS OTTO
WISE WITH HIS CANE. ,
Lawyer Goes to the Receiving Hos
pital While the Dentist Is Ax
rested for Battery, but
Released on Bail.
A vicious attack was made upon Attor
ney Otto Irving Wise by Dr. D. G. Dan
zlger in Justice Groezinger'B courtroom
yesterday morning. The assault was the
direct outcome of a fancied Insult offered
by the attorney to Dr. Danziger, who
was a witness in the suit of Mrs. G. H.
Jacobson against Rabbi Isador Myers for
$235, alleged to be due her. Wise was re
moved to the Receiving Hospital immedi
ately after the occurrence, and Danziger
was later arrested for battery and re
leased on $20 bail.
When the trial of the case commenced
yesterday Dr. Danziger was placed on
the witness stand by Attorney D. J. Crow
ley to testify as to the treatment Mis.
Jacobson and her daughter had received
at the hands of Rabbi Myers and his wife,
to whom Mrs. Jacobson Is related. Attor
ney Wise for the defense questioned the
witness closely, and after completing the
cross-examination addressed Judge Groez
inger, saying:
"That is all I care to ask this person."
Dr. Danziger took this as a direct re
flection, and in angry tones the irritated
withess advanced toward Wise and sa'.d:
"I will settle with you for this out
side."
Wise appealed to the court for protec
tion and Judge Groezinger rapping for or
der, said:
"I do not care what takes place outside
of the courtroom, but I will have no quar
reling here."
Bot't parties then subsided and after the
case had been continued until Monday and
court adjourned Danzlger approached
Wise and demanded an apology. Wise re
plied that he had no apology to make, and
Danzlger immediately hit the attorney a
terrific blow in the face and followed It
up by striking him on the head with a
stout cane. Wise fell over several chairs,
became hysterical and * pandemonium
reigned for some time. Some ladles threw
water in Wise's face and he soon revived.
Dr. Myers rushed into the corridor shriek
ing for the police, who soon responded.
As soon as Wise left the Receiving Hos
pital, to which he was taken for treat
ment, he Becured a warrant for the ar
rest of Danziger, "which was served by

BENDORAN
NO MATCH
FOR GEYSER
Coast Record Equaled by Win
ner â Books Getting the
Coin at Tanforan*
Raocpocrs to Tanforan yesterday were
disappointed In the meeting between Gey
eer with 109 pounds up and Bendoran car
rying Jl2 pounds. A battle royal was
looked for, but It proved only a skirmish.
Bfndoran closed favorite over the Corrl
pan entry, and after running out In the
had for something over half a mile, began
looking for a vacant seat in the rear of
the house. Spencer then let Geyser out
and he won easily, covering the seven fur
longs in I:2*3 â coast record time. Advance
Guard finished second, four lengths beiore
the favorite.
Not unlike the other days of the meet
ing, the books gathered most of the coin
in sight. Upsets there were in profusion,
with First Shot and M. F. Tarpey the
only first choices to land.
In the first number, a six-furlong selling
run, the favorite, First Shot, was given
a lively brush by Coming Event, a 15 to 1
shot. The latter made the running, at th*
end losing by only half a length. Tekla.
from the Shulte stable, commanded a
strong play, but failed to make any sort
of a showing. . , ,
The mile hurdle event was a farcical
affair. Ualista. second choice, bolted at
the start and was loft. Oraibee refused
at the first obstacle, and Meddler, the fa
vorite, dumped his rider at the second
leap. McKenna finally landed Credo, alj
to 1 shot, winner from Una Colorado by a
length. Major S. which balked taking the
lirst jump, finished third.
Del Paso 11. the Jennings entry, closed
favorite for the mile selling run. with
Spencer up. The brown horse made a
good stretch run. but was beaten easily
at the end by the 12 to 1 shot Toribio,
ridden by Jenkins. Storm King and Sil
ver Tail cut out the pace to the bend for
home.
After getting away from the post last
Charles Le Bel, second choice for the
seven furlong affair, plainly developed the
ract that he Was best. Thorpe persevered
with him. and overhauling the favorite,
Owyhee. forty yards from the wire won
by half a length. Jenkins on Owyhee
took matters- too easy, which cost him
the race. More ill luck was in store for
the favorite, the Judges disqualifying him
for swerving slightly. This gave Pongo
the place and Tom Smith third money.
Caldwell presented Corrigan's two
year-old M. F. Tarpey with the final
purse. Heavily played at short odds, the
younpster was sent away flying, with
CJavlon Brown, the second choice, almost
left. Ullaeon took the place from Briton.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1900.
CALLED GHOSTS
AND FORCED HER
TO MARRY RIM
Mrs. Reddan's Weird
Allegations.
SHE ASKS FOR AN ANNULMENT
SAYS HEB HUSBAND AND HIS
MOTHER STOLE HER.
Claims They Invited Her to Their
Home, Imprisoned Her and Com
pelled Her to Become a
Wife.
A dark room In which Augustus Reddan
reclined In his home at 511 Jones street
and called up shadows from the spirit
world, threats to maim, to kill and to Im
prison are the reasons which prompted
Mrs. Grace M. Reddan to marry, she al
leg"es In a complaint filed yesterday. In
which she prays for a decree annulling
the ties that bind her. Mrs. Reddan was
Miss Grace M. Lynch ur.til she married
Augustus Reddan on the nipht of Novem
ber 8 last. A few days following the mar
riage the neighbors were furnished with
food for gossip when the story et>t out
that the young bride had deserted her
husband while he was sleeping, a few
hours alter the ceremony was per
formed. In a complaint liU'd yesterday
Mrs. Reddan sets up various alleged reas
ons for her peculiar actions.
Mrs. Reddan says ehe vi^ted the home
of her husband's mother on the sth of
November, IWS. at 511 Jones street, and
was induced to remain over night ana was
promised that she could return to her par
ents' home the next day. She did as re
quested, but when Fhe awoke the next
morning she discovered that her wearing
apparel had disappeared, and on Investi
gation found that Reddan and his mother
had secreted it in a closet, but on de
mand the oid lady refused to deliver it
to her. but pave her an old wrapper to
weal" around the home. For three days,
Fhe says, they thus kept her prisoner. On
the following day, November 6, they took
her Into a dark room, her complaint con
tinues, and there Reddan entered into a
pretended trance and said he could see
her father with a revolver in his hand,
and that, he would either send her to
VVhittier Reform School or shoot her. All
3ay long Mrs. Reddan. the younger, says
phe was in constant dread and fear oâ¬
Reddan and his mother, and was .for
biddrn, under penalty of death, to leave
the house, unless she married the defend
ant. The following Monday she demand
ed to be let out of the bouse, but was
refused her liberty. Tuesday she was
again denied her liberty and on Wednes
day the defendant and his mother told
her that she would be shot unless she
consented to marry, and backed up their
threat by language too vulgar to mention,
the same evening, about S o'clock, she
Ras told that a marriage license was pro
rurrrd and at the same time \V. EL Red
dan, defendant's father, entered the home
In company of a minister of the gospel,
and she was forced to marry young Rtd
dan. The next morning at 2 o'clock, while
the defendant and his mother were aslee p,
Mrs. Itc ddan says, she escaped from the
house and has since remained away, and
at no time has entered into the mar
riage relation with him. In conclusion.
she prays for a decree annulling the mar
riage on the grounds named.
Mr. Reddan denied each and every alle
gation made by his wife. He pays that
on the day of the marriage hiÂ«" wife's
father came to the house, and that she
then said that she loved Mr. Reddan and
would marry him in spite of any opposi
tion. Friends Wf-.re present at the .cere
mony, he also states, r_nd -as- his wife
was not less anxious to marry than he,
he looked forward to a happy future. He
Is unable to explain his wife's desertion
of him, but says that he believes her
eister is largely responsible. When the
rase goes to trial he promises to disprove
nil her allocutions, and hones fn.rfiscnvoi-

Powers of the Fire Committee.
The Supervisors' Fire Committee de
cided yesterday to request the City At
torney for an opinion as to the powers
of the committee to grant privileges for
alterations of buildings. The Board of
Public Works Is vested with the- author
ity heretofore held by the Supervisors.
An opinion will be also received as to
the committees power to let contracts
for supplies for the Fire Department.
The Judiciary Committee will be asked to
define the duties of the standing com
mittees of the board. The San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company was granted
an extension of time to remove 100 poles
in what is known as "Underground Dis
trict No. 1," In the business section of
tho city. The company is unable to take
â¢down the poles, because the city uses
them for Fire Department wires and no
money is available to place the city's
wires underground.

WEBSTER LOSES
HIS FIGHT FOR
HIGH SALARIES
Turned Down by the
School Board.
CASSERLY WOULD NOT STAND
Superintendent of Schools Webster was
turned down cold yesterday by the Board
of Education. For' three weeks past he
has been fighting to have that body fix
tho salaries of his deputies at a figure
which would make it worth the while of
a competent educator to take up the
work. He considered $250 per month as
none too much and held out for that
amount. ' There was no member of the
School Board, however, who agreed with
him. President Mark was willing to make
tho monthly stipend $200 per month and
Webster at one time agreed to accept that
figure. When it came to a vote, however,
Denman, Casserly and Mrs. Kincald ob
jected. Casserly wanted to make it $2100
per year: Denman and Mrs. Kincald
wanted to allow but $150 per month and it
was known that they had candidates of
their own for two of the positions which
Webster proposed to fill.
When tne meeting came off yesterday
Webster made a formal application for
the amount which he first mentioned. He
figured on Casserly and Mark to back him
up, but Casserly went over to Denman
and Kincaid and Mark supported him
only in a negative manner. The result
was that a resolution presented by Cas
serly, but prepared by Denman, was
adopted (MarK not voting;, fixing the
monthly salary at $150. Webster entered
a formal protest anu left the room. The
reason given by the board for fixing the
salary at so low an amount was that in
tho opinion of the members a deputy
superintendent should receive no more
than a grammar school principal, but as
four grammar school principals now In
the department are receiving $200 per
month, Mr. Webster considers the excuse
inconsistent.
"This action by the board has disar
ranged all my plains and I do not know
now just what 1 shall do." said Mr. Web
ster, shortly after the meeting. "I had
intended to employ in the work I have
mapped out the most competent educators
in the department, but all of them have
told me that they would work for no such
amount as has been set aside for them.
I do not doubt but that I can find plenty
of people willing to become deputies for
$150 per month, and capable people at
that, but they will not be those who are
familiar with the reforms I have had in
view or as competent as those I had
selected to carry those reforms into effect.
There will be no appointments made for
some time to come."
A petition 'was received from the. West
of Castro Street Improvement Ciub re
questing the board to provide a school
house in the vicinity west of Diamond
street, between Twenty-second and
Twenty-fourth. It stated that the locality
in question was quite thickly populated,
and that the schoolhouse is an impera
tive necessity. The petition was referred
to a committee.
The board decided to adopt the rules of
189(5 without any of the subsequent amend
ments.
Ex-Inspector of Repairs Walker was di
rected to turn over all the property un
der his control to the Board of Public
Works, except a horse and buggy, which
will be retained for use in the depart
ment.
Secretary Hanson, who was authorized
at the last meeting of the board to adver
tise for bids for the removal of garbage,
requested that specifications be furnished
and it was so ordered.
Mrs. Orennan. a teacher In the Sunny
vale School, who has been under suspen
sion for two months, petitioned for re
instatement to her old position. As she
was never accorded a trial by the old
board, she will be given a hearing on
Thursday morning, January 25.
Miss M. D. Patrick sent in her resig
nation as a day teacher and it was ac
cepted. Miss Ida Roberts was transferred
from tho Grant to the John Swett School
at her own request, vice Miss B. Dworza
zek, resigned. Miss K. B. Childs of the
Denham School was granted a leave of
absence for six months.

Mrs. Delia Blum Gets Ten Days in
the County Jail.
Mrs. Delia Blum, a middle aged woman
living on Third street, between Howard
and Folsom, gave a minor a drink of
whisky, and now she must serve ten days
in the County Jail in consequence.
Tho minor was Ernest Fields, a boy 9
years of age, whose parents live at 2G4
Third street. He called upon Mrs. Blum
Monday and afterward was found in an
intoxicated condition by a policeman.
Mrs. Blum stated in court yesterday that
the boy's parents were in the habit of
giving him a little whisky, and she
thought there was nothing wrong in treat
ing him to a tablespoonful. The boy testi
fied that he drank a glassful and the offi
cer said the boy was drunk.
Judge Cabaniss thought there were mit
igating circumstances and sentenced the
woman to pay a fine of $100, with the al
ternative of ten days in Jail.

Fight of Western Jobbers Against
Unjust Discrimination in Favor
of Their Eastern Bivals.
For several years past the local com
mercial bodies have endeavored to secure
from the Federal authorities a chance
for the Western manufacturers to com
pete In the bidding for supplies for the
Government, but with poor success. It
has been generally believed that a "pull"
was being exercised by Eastern jobbers,
with the result that the West was shut
out of the competition. Shoes, clothing
and rations for the several army head
quarters along the Pacific have been sent
from the East, and even the supplies of
provisions, blankets, etc., for the In
dians, although the Western dealers have
stood ready and anxious to sell materials
of equal quality and at figures as low as
any given, minus the cost of transporta
tion.
The local commercial and Industrial
bodies some time ago joined in an urgent
appeal to the officials at Washington to
give the local manufacturers a chance
and. although some little headway was
made, the most encouraging response was
received yesterday at the Chamber of
Commerce.
Edward S. Rothchild of the firm of Hoff
man, Rothchild & Co., who was appointed
a special commissioner to visit Washing
ton and work among the representatives
of the West in an effort to secure a share
of Federal business, yesterday sent the
following encouraging report:
"I have met all the California delega
tion and took the matter up with them
fully. The Hon. Senator Perkins, E. F.
Loud and Julius Kahn, the latter especi
ally, are particularly solicitous. We
called upon the Quartermaster General
and are sure that San Francisco will have
a larger quota of business than she has
latterly had. I am in hopes that my ef
forts may be fraught with some good and
am sure that our Congressmen and Sena
tors, as also those of Oregon and Wash
ington, will co-operate in our at least hav
ing the opportunity for bidding on the
requirements for Government supplies as
they arise.
PASSED WORTHLESS CHECKS.
Mrs. M. A. Swift, Wife of an Army
Chaplain, Forges His Signature.
A. S. Mangrum of the firm of Mangrum
& Otter, hardware merchants, secured a
warrant from Judge Cabaniss yesterday
afternoon for the arrest of Mrs. M. A.
Swift, wife of the chaplain of the Thir
teenth Regiment, now in Manila, on the
charge of obtaining goods and money by
false pretenses. It is alleged that Janu
ary 8 she called at the store and pur
chased $14 25 worth of articles, giving in
payment a check for $30 on the First Na
tional Bank of Denver, purporting to be
signed by her husband. The check was
returned marked "Forged signature."
Detective Cody was detailed on the case
by Captain Bohen and he induced Man
grum to swear to the warrant. The ar
ticles were sent to Angel Island, where
they were found, Mrs. Swirt not having
called for the parcel. It is also said that
she obtained goods from Smith's Cash
Store and paid for them with a check on
the Denver bank. Her husband has funds
in the bank, and it is thought that she
was under the impression she could draw
on them. The police learned yesterday
from army sources that she Is not respon
sible for her actions.

JUDGE SEAWELL, has sustained
those provisions of the charter fixing
the qualifications necessary for suc
cessful candidacy for public office,
ar.d Joseph H. Scott, who received
the highest number of votes for Tax
Collector at the late election, has been
declared ineligible. His certificate of
election has been ordered annulled, and
In event the Supreme Court finds that
the ruling of the lower tribunal is prop
erty based Scott will be down and out.
without right, the lawyers say. of further
appeal.
The decision was handed down early
yesterday, and aJthoush it came as a mes
sage of Joy to Sheehan. the incumbent,
who Instituted the contest, it left Scott
and his followers worried and wondering.
Although victorious in the war of oppos
ing factions when the office was taken
by force on the fcth inst., it is very proba
ble that Scott and his deputies will be
lorcod to stand a siege until such time
a:t the Supreme Court passes final judg
r.wr.t. Sheehan's deputies whispered yes-
terday that there was a movement on
foot to again take the office by storm to
day. Whether or not they will see fit to
lay themselves liable to the law and the
risk of bullets fired by the other side
in defense of the premises is a matter of
some speculation. In any event, the po
lice will be in evidence and better pre
pared to handle a mob than on the day
of the notorious battle.
For a time yesterday Mayor Phelan
also threatened to create new complica
tions by declaring the office of Tax Col
lector vacant and filling it by appoint
ment. Counsel advised him. however, that
before he could exercise his authority he
must be backed by a decision of the Su
preme Court, and acting on this advice
he refrained from creating another riot.
It may be several months before the final
decision in the controversy is placed on
record. In the Interim a spirit of unrest
will prevail in the Tax Collector's office
and any minute the sound of falling blud
geons and the crack of revolvers may
herald the beginning of another brawl.
In his decision annulling Scott's certifi
cate of election Judge Seawell In part
says:
The ground upon which the present con
test is made is that respondent was not an
elector of the city and county of San Fran
cisco for the five years next preceding the
time of said election. In order to be an
elector, it Is necestary that the citizen
should have been a resident of the State one
year next preceding an election and of the
county in which he claims his vote ninety
days.
It is an undisputed fact that from Jan
uary 1, 1533, until the latter part of July,
IS?4. the respondent was a resident and
elector of the county of Santa Clara. It is
claimed by respondent that In the latter
part of July. 1594. he changed his resi
dence to the city and county of San Fran
cisco. If the evidence shows that Â»uch was
the fact, the respondent is entitled to Judg
ment.
I have been unable to resist the conclu
sion that the respondent was. during the
entire year IjSI, a resident of Santa Clara
county. In the removal of Mrs. Scott to
San Francisco in May of 1594 there was, at
the time, no FUggestlun or thought of
changing the domicile of respondent. As an
independent proposition, the idea of chang
ing hla own residence at that particular
time does not a;>[>ear to have entered re-
Fpondent's mind. He certainly did not con
trmplate the contingency that a charter
would be adopted by the electors of San
Francisco by the provisions of which a
j.revlou* residence of five years and ninety
days was a necessary qualification for the
office of Tax Collector and that he would
become a candidate for that ofHce In No
vember. IS?9.
The respondent says In his testimony,
"When I sent Mrs. t^cott to fc'an Francisco
my intention was to come to Pan Francisco
to reside as soon as I could. permanently" â
not that It was his Intention to reside here
then. He does not even remember whether
he came here with her. which he certainly
would have done if In brlnpinK his wife to
,Â«an Francisco he was performinÃ an act in
tended to operate as a change of domicile.
A residence can be changed only by the
union of act and intent. In the case of re
spondent. I find that there was in the year
ISS4. neither the act of removal by him to
San Francisco nor the Intent to make his
domicile there. He continued during all that
year, as before, living and carrying on busi
ness in San Jose. He did undoubtedly in
tend, after he had disposed of his business
in lhÂ» latter place, to return here to reside
permanently, but the existence of such an
intention did not affect his status aa a resi-
dent and elector of Santa Clara County. aÂ»
long as he continued to reside at San Jose.
It is not my province, even were I so
Inclined, to question the wisdom of the pro
version of the charter under consideration.
That It is constitutional I have not the
MlÃhtent doubt: and while I sympathize
with the respondent. In h!Â« disappointment
at the result of this contest, my views as
to the law and the evidence compel me to
declare that he was not on the 7th day of
November, ISS9. eligible to the office of Tax
Collector of the city and county of San
Francisco.
After the reading of the decision, A.
Rucf, representing Mr. Scott, asked the
court for a ten days" stay of execution.
The court granted the motion. Late in
the afternoon Mr. Tuska, who is asso
ciated with Mr. Ruef, filed notice of ap
peal, and within the next few days the
Supreme Court will have the points of
the controversy before it for adjudica
tion.
Although Sheehan was the contestant
and presumably brought the contest for
the purpose of remaining in office, it has
been intimated that he was only acting
in conjunction with R. P. Dooian, with
the understanding that the latter was to
be appointed to the vacancy, if one were
created, and would in turn take care of
Sheehan. The court, however, failed to
pass on his status in the litigation, but
thÂ«* fight is not yet ended. This led Mayor
Phelan to believe that the right to exer
cise his prerogative had arrived, but, as
before stated, he was for once wisely ad
vised and a further tangle was obviated.
To-day, If the counsel of the wiser heads
prevails and the assault upon the office
is not made by the Sheehan contingent,
a calm attempt to wrest the office from
Scott will be made by Attorney Garret
McEnerney, who represents Sheehan. A
motion to dissolve the Injunction issued
by Presiding Judge Bahrs during the riot
of January 8. restraining Sheehan from
further defending his claim to the office
except in the courts of law and equity,
will be made before Judge Cook and the
legality of the injunction determined.
-The Judgment rendered by Judge Sea
well decreeing that Mr. Scott Is Ineligible
to fill the position does not become final
until passed upon by the Supreme Court,
to which an appeal is required to betaken
within ten days after Judgment. said
Mry McEnerney yesterday. So that if
Mr. Sheehan's sole reliance were in his
contest commenced before Judge Seawell
neither he nor anybody else would be en
titled to the place until Judge Seawell's
decision was affirmed by the Supreme
Court. But In addition to commencing the
contest relating to Mr. Scott's ineligibillty
Mr Sheehan Insisted upon holding the of
fice. This he had the right to do. as we
understand the law. unless a successor
â¢was chosen who is eligible under the law.
"We understand the law to be that
when an officer is in the possession of an
office the only way to dispossess him is
through the courts. It is expressly pro
vided that a usurper may be fined, and
that If his usurpation is maintained In
bad faith the fine can be made to fit the
case, but we think that Mr. Sheehan's
dispossession of the office of Tax Collec
tor is altogether unwarranted both by the
force used by Mr. Scott in his endeavor to
take possession and in the issuance of the
injunction. . â¢ ? -.
"We have delayed making a motion re
instating Mr. Sheehan pending Judge Sea
well's decision, which is now rendered and
clears the matter up."
MAXWELL STATES
HIS CASE IN A
POWERFUL BRIEF
History and Law for
Supreme Judges.
CHARTER LAW WAS VIOLATED
?
FIRE COMMISSION EXCEEDED
ITS PRIVILEGES.
Decision in a Case Parallel With That
of the DÂ«posed Secretary in New
York City Results in Judg
ment for Plaintiff.
A strong brief, setting forth in full the
exact position taken by George Maxwell
in his fight for reinstatement as secretary
of the Fire Commission, will be filed to
day with the Supreme Court by Garret
"W. McEnerney. Mr. Maxwell's attorney.
Late last week Mr. McEnerney filed a
petition for a writ of mandate to compel
the Commissioners to abide by the provi
sions of the charter and reappoint Max
well, who had served faithfully for years,
as an employe of the Fire Department,
and the brief to be filed to-day is designed
to support the petition.
In his brief Mr. McEnerney recites the
law under which Maxwell was appointed
to the Fire Department in April, IS7B, and
follows him through many promotions to
the position of secretary, which he held at
the time the charter went into effect. ! He
also quotes the sections of the charter
which he claims were deliberately violated
by. the Fire Commissioners in ousting
Maxwell and seating J. C. Gorman in his
place. The law quoted reads as follows:
"The Board of Fire Commissioners shall
immediately after their appointment and
qualification proceed to reorganize tho
Fire Department in conformity with the
provisions of this charter. In so doing
the board shall make its appointment of
officers ;*nd members from the persons
constituting the force in the service of
the Fire Department at the time the char
ter goes into effect. Such persons shall
not be required to pass any civil service
examinations. If any reduction is made
in the force of the department the Com
missioners may temporarily discharge
those persons whose discharge shall be
most conducive to the efficient reorganiza
tion of the department, but In case of a
subsequent Increase of the force those
temporarily discharged . shall be reap
pointed without civil service examination
and assigned to the same rank in which
they were at the time of their discharge."
A second section quoted provides that
no officer, member or employe of the de
partment shall be transferred or dis
missed except for cause and after a trial.
Mr. McEnerney's brief is based princi
pally upon the first section. He contends
that Maxwell held under the old govern
ment precisely the same position created
by the charter. He points out that not
withstanding that no charges were ever
made against him and no trial had, the
Commissioners summarily dismissed him.
That they did not do so in order to "re
duce the department" Is evident, he ar
gues, in the fact that the Commissioners
appointed J. C. Gorman as his successor
immediately upon his dismissal.
A case which parallels that of Mr. Max
well has Just r>een terminated in New
York City by a judgment for heavy dam
ages and reinstatement for the plaintiff.
The same provisions are made in the
New York charter as In the local law
for the guidance of the Fire Department,
and Colonel Carl Jussen, secretary of the
New York board, was discharged from
his position as secretary immediately
upon the appointment of a new commis
sion. Jussen at once brought suit against
Commissioner Scannel for reinstatement
and damages, and the action terminated
on the 6th inst. In a judgment in his fa
vor handed down by Justice Nash of the
Supreme Court. Jussen's allegations were
practically the same as those pet forth
by Mr. Maxwell, and Mr. McEnerney is
known to be building high hope of suc
cess on the New York decision.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 18, 1900.
BOLD SCHEME
TO INCREASE
LOCAL TAXES
Chief Burden to Fall
on Realty.
IMMUNITY FOR CORPORATIONS
?
VALUATION TO BE INCREASED
ONE HUNDRED MILLION.
Assessor Dodge's Startling Proposi
tion to Board of equalization in
Direct Contradiction to Ante-
Election Promises.
>
Before the election beautiful visions of
municipal prosperity under the new char
ter were unfolded to the public by Mayor
Phelan and Assessor Washington Dodge.
The Assessor's refrain on the stump was
low taxes for homesteaders. He prom
ised that the reduction would be brought
about by placing a Just share of the tax
burdens on the rich corporations. The
only thing needed to bring a sunburst
of prosperity was the election of Phelan
and Dodge to administer affairs of gov
ernment under the new charter.
Since the election another vision has
been unfolded. Assessor Washington
Dodge has discovered that municipal ex
penses will be increased rather than di
minished by the operation of the new
charter. He found that more money than
was formerly provided had to be raised.
In casting about for ways and means to
raise the sum required he appealed to the
State Board of .Equalization. He said to
the board:
Mayor Phelan and I have rone over the
matter carefully and we find that the dollar
tax on San Francisco's valuation of $450,000,
000 will not produce sufficient money to '
meet the expenses of the municipal govern
ment under the new charter, and we pro
pose to increase the valuation one hundred
million dollars. We want this increase for
local purposes, and therefore we ask that
the State Board of Equalization, in fixing
the San Francisco -valuation for State pur
poses, shall make a reduction of one hun
dred million dollars, so that the Increase
may only have local effect.
The State Board of Equalization In
quired if Assessor Dodge proposed to in
crease the assessment of corporations In
order to add one hundred millions to the
roll. The Assessor replied:
"No, the corporations are assessed up to
the limit. We propose to place the In
crease on realty."
The plain propoFltlon of Phelan and
Dodge is to make a tax raid on the small
rial estate owners. The increased burden
is to be placed on the realty. The cor
porations so viciously assailed by the As
sessor when he was out vote-getting are
to have special immunity.
It is hardly possible that the State Board
of Equalization will ever consent to per
perpetrate such an outrage as Assessor
Dodge suggested. Dodge before the elec
tion posed as a reformer, the champion of
the people and the advocate of good gov
ernment, but the overtures made to the
State Board of Equalization show that he
Is only a common, every-day politician
and pledge-breaker.

5IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION.
1 \EPORTS from Washington are to the effect
VâS that there are abundant indications in both house*
of Congress that there wilfbe strong opposition
to the Lodge immigration restriction bill, which has
Leen reintroduced into the Senate by the author with
out alteration. In that there is nothing surprising,
for there has always been a strong lobby to oppose
any kind of restriction upon immigration, but it is
surprising to learn, upon the authority of the P.hila
delphia Record, that it appears Speaker Henderson
has so organized the Committee on Immigration of
the House that the Lodge bill or any like measure
will have slight prospect of success in this Congress.
The advocates of unrestricted immigration have in
vented a new argument. It is now asserted that the
movement to check undesirable immigration is due to
the spirit of Know Nothingism, Nativism and
A. P. A. influences. The assertion is absolutely with
out foundation. The movement was the logical out
come of the protective tariff system. It was recog
nized that if we are to afford adequate protection to
American labor as well as to American manufactures
it would be necessary to put some restraint upon the
importation of cheap labor from Europe. In addi
tion to that fact, there was the further incentive to
restriction caused by the difficulty of assimilating the
hordes of ignorant and often vicious immigrants who
were pouring in. from Southeastern Europe.
Of course the object of the advocates of the free
importation of cheap labor in asserting an A. P. A.
origin of the restriction movement is to discredit it.
Accordingly they go further and argue that restriction
would shut out desirable immigrants from British

THE LAW AND THE SECRETARY.
AMONG the bills before Congress is one declar
ing: "That the failure of the Secretary of the
Treasury to prescribe regulations for the use
of alcohol in the arts and in medicinal and other like
compounds, as required by section 61 of the act of
August 28, 1894, shall not operate as a defense on the
part of the United States to any suit of a manufac
turer under said act brought in any court of the
United States, and a new trial may be granted here
under in any such suit heretofore dismissed."
Back of the bill there is not only an interesting
story but an, important question of governmental
authority. The act referred to is the tariff act of 1894,
and the section in question declares: "Any manu
facturer finding it necessary to use alcohol in the
arts, or in any medicinal or other like compound,
may use the same under regulations to be prescribed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, and on satisfying
the Collector of Internal Revenue for the' district
\vherein he- resides or carries on business that he. has
complied with such' regulations and has used such
alcohol therein, and exhibiting and delivering up the
stamps which show that a tax has been paid thereon,
shall be entitled to receive from the treasury of the
United States a rebate or repayment of said tax so
paid."
The Secretary of the Treasury made no regulations
under which the rebate could be obtained. A suit
was brought by certain manufacturers to recover
. from the Government the amount of money to which
j they would have been entitled under the act had the
J Secretary carried out that requirement of the law.
j The Supreme Court 'decided that the law gave the
j Secretary discretionary powers either to provide for
i the rebate or riot, as he thought best, and since he
! made no provision for it the manufacturers have no
rigjit to it. Â¦ I
The object of the bill before Congress is to pro
vide a means by which the rebate money can be re
j covered despite the failure of the Secretary of the
Treasury to make the regulations required. The jus
tice of the bill will hardly be disputed. It was clearly
the intention of Congress to grant rebates of the tax
on alcohol used in manufacturing, and, that intent
should not be defeated by the failure of the Secretary
to carry out the duty the law imposed upon him.
Mayor Phelan has probably come to the conclusion
that he is a member of that very interesting class
which can't be libeled. Is it possible that he does
not fear what is said in criticism of him, but dreads
what may be said?
THE VOICE OF THE PEE-WEE.
COLONEL BRYAN. has decreed that Jackson
day shall become a movable feast. Under all
former Democratic leaders the anniversary of
the battle of New Orleans, the Bth of January, was
celebrated in banquets in which the national thirst
was well and variously quenched, and that for party
power and victory was distressingly increased by
lar^'e doses of the salty principles supposed to be ad
vocated by Old Hickory. But Colonel Bryan desires
to have charge of the feast, and so makes one-night
ttands of it, on a circuit that takes in Chicago,
Omaha, Lincoln, Kansas City. Minneapolis, St.
Paul and a number of other populous places. âHi-?
new Tackson day extends from the 6th of January to
the middle of the month, and he appears at all the
stands as the star performer. If any city will set a
table and get a crowd to hear him he will prolong th?
circuit to the Ist of February.
The colonel, who formerly clothed his neck with
thunder and stamped like a warhorse in battle, is
showing signs of deterioration and decay. The
nionotor.ous task of making the same speech for four
years begins to teil on him. His lines are not hard
to remember, and he always carries a prompter to
give him the cue. But it is said that even in music,
that high manifestation and utterance of refinement
too tenuous for speech, prolonged and constant repe
tition palls. The most popular classical music con
stantly repeated wearies, and the hearer turns away,
with that tired feeling, to recruit himself on some rag
time melody that rises from the very gutter of har
mony
Colonel Bryan's range was never very great, and
his art has consisted in saying shallow things in a
ccep way. But the number of his prominent ad
nnrers is rapidly decreasing, as may be seen by read
ing the li^t of the chorus which appears with him at
every stand on hi? Jackson day circuit. This fallinsr
away is cue to the discovery that he is not a seer,
rtvelator nor prophet, but that his little song is that
of the political pec-wee.
After his usual fashion he attempted to make him
6eÂ»f the beneficiary of the ami-impcrhl sentiment of
the country, forgetting that it was originated as a
national policy by his own supporters. His discussion
of it was like his discussion of all ether public issues,
en attempt to bore an auger-hole with a gimlet.
Now, however, he has seen . a new light. The
original Democratic imperialists of the South are as
serttng themselves. They even threaten to find a
market for raw cotton via the next Democratic pla*
farm. The movement is portentous; it threatens
Colonel Bryan's primacy of his party. It threatens
even to overwhelm "the divine ratio" of 16 to i. It
betrays impatience with Colonel Bryan's solo, which
has turned rank and rancid in the wearied ear of the
country.
Therefore Colonel Bryan finds it necessary to
hedge, and his hedging presents him to the country
2s a political pee-v.ee.
At his onc-siight Jackson day stand in Minneapolis
lie annouTiccd himself as a sort of expansionist and
submitted a new ground pl an an j f ron t elevation of
himself in that capacity. In the words and phrases
following he sar.g his new and small song: "I am a
firm believer in the enlargement and extension of the
I-rrits of the republic. I don't mean by that the ex
tension by the addition of contiguous territory, nor
to limit myself to that. Wherever there is a people
intelligent enough to form a part of this republic it
is my belief that they should be taken in. Wherever
there is a people capable of having a voice and a rep
resentation in this Government there the limits of the
republic may be extended." And that is the sort of
; t n expansionist Colonel Bryan is! Wherever a peo
ple advances in intelligence to the standard of self
government they are to pay the penalty by being
"taken in." Nothing is said about their desire to
come; nothing about the dangers and difficulties of
a republic consisting of non-tiguous Stntes widely
feparated and utterly lacking in that homogeneity
which can exist only by contiguity, and which h the
first condition of republican government. The voice
of common sense is never permitted to whisper in
Colonel Aryan's ear. which is plugged tight with
self-conceit. But that voice uttered to the average
American citizen will say that wherever may exist
the capacity for self-government described by Colonel
Bryan its proof is the establishment of an indepen
dent republic that does not r.eed to be "taken in" by
ms. It was the dream of the political philosophers
vho created this republic that the nations and races,
moved upon by our example, would rise into the at
moÂ«phere of self-government and clothe them
with independence, under such forms as were adapted
to their special genius and habit. None of those
philosophers contemplated the possibility or the de
sirability of a world-wide trust in civil government,
which would incorporate with itself the varying peo
ples who desired to govern themselves. It has re
mained for Colonel Bryan to conceive it to be the
('â¢uty of this republic to throw homogeneity and con
tinuity to the winds and fpeck the globe with its
States until the planet is pockmarked with the rotten
boroughs, peopled by all colors, speaking in more
tongues than stopped hod-carrying on the tower of
Pabcl. and without any spirit of assimilation to bring
them into that community of tastes, aspirations and
sympathy which alone makes it possible for men to
live under a common constitution of government.
The .American imperialists arc not wise, but com
pared with Bryan they loom up like Solomon con
tested with the idiot of a Scotch parish.
CONGRESSMEN ON DEATH.
WHEN a Congressman dies his colleagues set
apart a day upon which to pronounce eulo
giums upon him. It is then that they lift their
minds above the low levels of tariff and finance and
discuss the higher themes of life and immortality.
Of such occasions it may be said they are times that
try men's eloquence, and it is frequently fortunate that
the orations are with due decorum regarded as
solemn utterances, for otherwise they might fre
quently move to smiles.
A recent number of the Congressional Record
comes to us filled with eulogiums upon departed
statesmen. One orator reminded his fellow Senators:
"The life of the busy, active, public man, who has
dealt with the affairs of his time with care and skill
and good judgment, finds its close just as certainly
as that of the humblest person who has wrought out
his own salvation while on earth." Doubtless that re
minder to the Senators that they cannot escape the
end that comes to the humble who work out their own
salvation was needed; but why did the speaker deem
it worth while to add: "The approach qi death,
whether it appears in the silence and quiet of the
peaceful home or in the midst of the thunder of bat
tle, with the attendant struggle of warfare and
carnage, always reaches the same result â ultimate
rest; the rest and quiet of the grave"? Did any Sen
ator suppose it ended elsewhere?
In a review of this kind of things, so impersonal
and solemn, it would be an impropriety to make use
of names. Even if reference were made to a speech
commending one of the illustrious dead because he
"had the good fortune to belong to that mixed
Dutch-English ancestry which has the inspiration of
glorious traditions' of civil and religious literature,
of arts and arms," it would be an impertinence to add
that it was Chauncey Depew who spoke it. There
fore it matters not who told the Senate: "The great
mystery of death in all ages has challenged the wis
dom of men for its solution, and to-day, after count
less efforts in consideration of the* problem, man
kind is quite as helpless and unsettled as it was six
thousand years ago."
In the House the orators are bolder than the Sen
ators, and at times do not hesitate to advance explana
tions of that profound mystery â the death of a Con
gressman. Thus in this same number of the Record
a Representative in eulogizing a departed colleague
said of him: "He loved discussion and took ,tÂ»art in
the running debates at every opportunity. His tongue
was full of words, and it tossed them right and left
at the slightest provocation." Another orator, doubt
less recalling that trait of the great man. said: "Re
flection only mystifies, and the field of vision and re
search will not reveal; yet it must be that the God
of all, in the interminable conflict with Satan, needed
less advocates here or a more skilled one in the per
fectly developed world where acoustic properties arc
unlimited and human effort becomes divine."
After that nothing more need be said. The con
ception that Congressmen are summoned to the other
world to make speeches in a realm Where acoustic
properties are unlimited must be consoling to all of
those dignitaries. They may have to die like the
humblest who work out their own salvation, but be
yond the grave they may still hope to be golden
mouthed orators with an eternity for utterance.
NATIVES TELEGRAPH WITH RUDE DRUMS.
AFRICANS' MEANS OF
SENDING NEWS.
outpost and found that it would be impossible for him
to reach home until late at night. As he looked forward
to a hearty dinner, he requested a head man, who was with
him and who was an expert drummer, to send word to the
station, several miles away, that dinner was- not to be
served until he returned.. The head man drummed;
straightway another drummer repeated his message, and
so the news was flashed from point to point until it
reached the distant station. When Five reached home at
night he found the table laid- and the dinner ready to be
served. This was the meysage his servants had received:
"The Bvila Matori (Governor or Inspector) will be at home
late in the evening. Don't eat everything up."
Mistakes are sometimes made in telegraphing and tel
ephoning, and Peter de Deken's second story shows that
one may blunder also in using the drum language. In
spector Five took several photographs during his stay at
Basolco and on the day of his departure the thought
struck him that It would be well to take a photograph of
all those natives who from time to time had acted as his
domestic servants. Accordingly, he ordered a drummer to
notify them that they were to appear before him at a cer
tain hour In their holiday clothes. The drummer at uncs
sent a message, but what was Five 1 * surprise to find at
the appointed hour not hJa servants, but a!! the
police of the station, drawn up in front of_his residence
The drummer. It seems, had either misunderstood Five or
had blundered in sending the message. Instead of sum
moning domestic servants he had summoned state ser
vants.

A DAILY HINT FROM PARIS
PHELAN THE PURIST.
(Stockton Independent.)
The San Francisco Call yesterday made
the specific charge that Mayor James D.
Phelan has committed a felony by enter-
Ing into a contract before election with
the object of securing support in his can
didacy to turn the police over to
Andy LawYence. for Esola, his creature.
It invites and dares Phelan to begin a
suit for libel because of this charge. The
Chronicle makes substantially the same
charge editorially. The Bulletin has inti
mated the same thing in every recent Is
sue, but few had any sympathy or confi
dence in the Bulletin's agitation, because
it was an adherent of Phelan in the re
cent election and was repeatedly Warned
by this paper and others that it was fol
lowing a course that would lead to its own
undoing.
It is now undeniable that In electing
Phelan Mayor of the city the Republicans
of San Francisco not only helped to boom
him as candidate for the Senate and
helped him to fasten a Democratic ma
chine on the city, but hoisted a man. dis
guised as a purist in politics, who delib
erately defied and violated the laws' of the
State in making the most venal contracts
for the sake of getting votes. It is a sor
ry outlook for the metropolis.
LATE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Commended
By Rt. Rev. father Prendergast.
San Francisco, Jan. 13, 1900.
Dear Father Wyman: It was with in
expressible satisfaction that the Moat
Rev. Archbishop, all the clergy and all
Catholicsâ l might add, all respectable
citizensâ heard, some months ago, of the
success of the efforts of the Paulist
Fathers and their friends for the effectual
and permanent purification of the vicinity
of your church. The late Board of Super-
visors are entitled to an honorable place in
the history of San Francisco for the prac
tical measures they adopted toward that
end; and, no doubt, the Board of Public
Works will now be authorized to act and
will proceed at once to give effect to the
design so universally applauded. Thoee
who, like myself, were connected with the
old cathedral for years, will have especial
cause to rejoice when that old plague spot
Is converted Into a beautiful, pleasant park
and the whole district from California
street to Market street Is as free from
noxious exhalation as any other part of
the city. This accomplished, it will be
your duty to enlarge the area reconquered
by your energy and zeal to the pure hgnt
of heaven, very sincerely,

LEAP YEARâ M. B. A.. Sacramento.
Cal. It Is not every year that is divisible
by four that is a leap year. If a year was
exactly S65Vi days we would have a leap
year every four years regularly, but as
there is an excess of eleven minute
10.3 seconds every year this excess
Is compensated by dropping the leap year
at the beginning: of three out of four cen
turies, thus equalizing the time gained
through the century. The length of time
thus established makes an error of only
one day in 332> years. The Gregorian cal
endar, established kn 1552. was so arrangjd
that of the hundredth years to come only
four hundredth years were to be blsextllp
years, having 366 days, whereof the year
1600 was the first. Such one hundredth
years as are divisible by 400 are Istip
years; 1900 is not a leap year becauso
It cannot be divided by 400 without a re

For Making Opium Illicitly.
Charley Ilingr, Chinese, was held to an-

tured opium illicitly and for having re-
filled Imported opium cans without having
destroyed the customs stamps on them.

1 7\ If UCH surprise has been expressed at the quick-"
I \/\ ness with which the natives of South Africa
I V I have learned the results of the recent battles be-
I tween . the Boers and British. These natives
A know nothing of our method of telegraphing,
and yet, when victory has been declared for either of the
contending parties, the news has been flashed with amazing
celerity to remote parts of the country. The manner in
which the news is carried Is novel and most interesting.
Throughout Africa the natives are expert in the use of
what Is known as the drum language, and they use it as
we use the telegraph and the telephone, namely, for the
purpose of sending a message from one place to another.
The most Important events, as well as the dally oc
currences in every village, are transmitted in this way. In
the Congo region, near, St&nlej* Falls, some of the natives
are so skilled in the use of the drums that they can carry
on a conversation with one another at a great distance
just as easily as though they were standing side by side.
The chiefs or head men of the various tribes converse
daily in this fashion, and thus each quickly learns what
has occurred in the surrounding districts during the past
twenty-four hours. The drum used for this purpose is
fashioned, as a rule, out of a hollow tree trunk, which is
covered with the skin of an antelope.
In regard to the quickness with which news Is trans
mitted in Africa Peter de Deken, the famous traveler,
tells two good stories. While Inspector Five was in con
trol of the station at Basoko, he visited one day a distant
Islands and from Northern and Western Europe.
That is done for the purpose of arraying against the
restriction bill all the foreign-born population of the
country. Such assertions are utterly unfair, but they
will have to be met, for unless contradicted and re
futed they may have weight in determining the action
of not a few members of Congress representing dis
tricts in which there are a large number of foreign-.,
born voters.
The people of the United States are hospitable in
their welcome to deserving immigrants from all na
tions who are fitted to assimilate with the popula
tion of the country and become fitted for citizenship.
They are not willing, however, to leave the doors
open to all comers, many of whom enter for no
other purpose than that of underbidding^ American
workingmen in the labor market and earning money
to take out of the country as soon as they can get
enough to return home arid establish themselves
there.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY IS, 1900.
MAYOR PHELAN'S REPLY
\/l AYOR PHELAN yesterday made his reply to
I \ the charge of The Call that he had committed
a felony by making, prior to the recent elec
tion, a bargain to turn the Police Department of the
city over to A. M. Lawrence. The reply was an
evasion. It wis not an answer. With a multiplicity
of words and with many a devious turning to irrele
vant issues the Mayor sought to confound the public
and conceal the truth. Out of the mass of words,
however, something of the truth can be brought to
light, and when that is done.it will be seen the long
and tortuous manifesto is a virtual confession of guilt-
When publishing the charge against the Mayor The
Call challenged him to bring the issue before the
courts by a libel suit. That challenge was made be
cause as the time allowed under the purity of elec
tion law for making protests against any candidate
who violated it in the last election has now expired
there is no other way by which the issue can be
brought into the courts to be investigated and judged.
The Mayor declares he will not sue The Call for
libel. He asserts that the votes cast in his favor last
November acquit him of a charge of felony made on
Tuesday, and made again to-day. He makes use of
very brave words in reference to men who live in high
towers, who prostitute their profession and are black
guards, but he does not show Â«ny courage in sum
moning into court men who in good, honest, straight
forward English charge him with felony and chal
lenge him to the only form of contest where the truth
can be established on sworn testimony and be fully
made known.
There are some corrupt men who are astute enough
to be able to use many words without betraying
themselves, but Mayor Phelan is not one of them. He
has the cunning to resort to a wilderness of words for
hiding, but not the skill to conceal his tracks through
them. Thus his defense itself affords evidence to jus
tify his conviction. He admits that he frequently re
sorted to the Examiner office and held conferences
concerning the Police Department, that Esola was
present at several of the conferences, that his name
was mentioned in connection with the office of Chief
of Police; and he adds: "I was not unaware of the
fact that his' friends expected for him some recogni
tion in the line of promotion in case I was elected to
office."
That much the Mayor betrays through sheer
fluency of words, and from that can be estimated what
he would be forced to admit further were he subject
to cross-examination in the courts.
From that point the Mayor goes on to fling asper
sions upon all around him. According to his state
ments the Police Department under the former board
was controlled by a corrupt "upper office"; only
Esola was good; all journalists are blackguards and
prostitutes except the Examiner, which, to quote his
own words, "never, like others, truckled to those
evil influences I have described and which beset our
city."
There is much more of that kind in the Mayor's re
ply, but it is not worth while going over it. From the
specimen quoted the public can judge the whole. The
Mayor avows the / Examiner to be his type of re
former and declares his intention to run the city along
the lines of the practices of that paper. If that be
not a confession of the truth of the charge made by
The Call, what is it?
The Call repeats the charge that in order to en
compass his election Mayor Phelan bargained away
to a predatory gang the Police Department of the
city, and asserts again that it has sufficient evidence
to sustain the charge in a court of justice.
It is no answer to that charge to say that Esola is
the only incorruptible officer on the police force and
Andrew Lawrence the only honorable journalist in
California. Neither was the charge refuted by the
votes cast in his favor last November, when the peo
ple were .ignorant of the conspiracy that had been ar
ranged between Phelan and the advocates of a "wide
open town."
There is but one way to refute the charge, and that
way is provided by law. The courts are open to the
Mayor. The Call is amply responsible. Its pro
prietor and editor does not live in hiding outside the
jurisdiction of California courts. There will'be no
difficulty in finding some one to hold responsible for
The Call charges. There will be no evasion, no flying
from justice, no equivocation and no lying to avoid
responsibility on the part of The Call. The Mayor
is charged with felony and with conspiring to betray
the city into the hands of rascals by giving them con
trol of the police force. That is the issue. Mayor
Phelan dare not meet it.

HARBOR BOARD PERPLEXED.
Wharf Repairs Nccsssitate aÃemoval
of the Marion.
The Harbor Commissioners are in a
state of perplexity as to what to do with
the training ship Marion, the removal of
which from Howard street wharf No. 3
is necessitated by the repairs to be com
menced there In two weeks. Captain Nat
James and General Dickinson held a con
ference with President Kilburn and Com
missioner llarney yesterday In regard to
a permanent slip for the vessel, the re
sult being that the matter was referred to
Commissioner Harney a^id Chief Wharfin
ger Henderson for further consideration.
The docks are crowded, owing to the brisk
condition of trade, but the otticials assert
their intention of providing the Marion
with as good a slip as can possibly be ob
tained.
The contract for rebuilding Spear street
wharf was awarded by the Commission
ers to James A. McMann for J1799 15, and
the contract for removing the tugboat
wharf to the Dundon Bridge & Construc
tion Company for $253 -JO. Healy & Teb
bltts were the lowest bidders for recon
structing Spear street wharf, but their
bid was rejected as irregular. The ac
ceptance of an oral proposition, while
legal, in the opinion of ex-Governor Budd.
was decided to be a bad precedent.
The balance due to the estatÂ« of A. Page
Brown, the architect, of $3710 79 for plans
In connection with the Union Depot and
Ferry House was allowed and ordered
paid.
Chief Engineer Holmes reported that
the damage by fire to the grain sheds at
section 1 of the peawall was $i2<>o. An ex
amination of the books In the secretary's
office by an expert showed the accounts to
be in perfect condition. A petition of the
Custom-house for more room at Main

SUGAR BOATS
CANNOT LOAD
AT HONOLULU
? â
Will Go to Outside
Ports for Cargoes.
The strict quarantine at Honolulu is
driving a lot of vessels away from that
port. Quite a fleet has been lying there
for some time awaiting a sugar cargo, but
as there is no communication with the
plantations on the island they have been
unable to get a load. Many of the vessels,
according to advices by the steamer
China, are going to Makawell and other
open rcadsteds. They will anchor off shore
and the sugar will be brought off to them
In small steamers. In this way a cargo
will be secured and the fleet will be able
to reach this port without any more de
lay.
There are only three sugar boats in San
Francisco at the present time, and the
bark Albert Is the only one of the three
loading for Honolulu. Of the others the
Kails of Clyde will go to Hllo and the
Planter to Lahnla. Of the entire sugar
llect there are only four on the way here,
all the others being tied up by the quar
antine. The four are the ship Centennial
and the barks Alden Besse, Martha Da
vis and Diamond Head, all of which are
now out ten days.
The Alaska Commercial Company's
steamer Bertha sailed for Unalaska yes
terday. She took away a large quantity
of merchandise for Cape Nome, but It will
not reach the diggings before spring. The
goods will be landed and stored In the
company's warehouse at Unalaska and
then when the lee opens In the spring It
will be carried on up to Nome In the side
wheel, steamer Sadie. By this means tho
Commercial Company will probably land
its goods two weeks ahead of anybody else
at tlie diggings.
The Bertha took away quite a number
of miners and cannery men. The miners
are going to the Apollo mine on Unga
Island and the cannery men are like the
Cape Nome merchandise. They are going
north now so as to be first on the fishing
grounds In the spring.
The British ship Annie Thomas is now
out 166 days from Cardiff for Acapulco,
and the underwriters are paying 3o per
cent to reinsure vessel and cargo. The
Thomas Is commanded by Captain Mere
dith, who Is. well known In San Francisco.
He was here about three years ago In the
Dominion, but left that vessel to take ui3
present command. After he left ihe Do
minion that vessel was sent to Hawaii,
and from Honolulu she started for Puget
Sound in ballast. That Was a year ago.
and neither vessel nor crew has ever been
heard from since.
The underwriters are also afraid for tlio
British ship Reliance. She is now out
185 days from Hamburg for San Fran
cisco, and 1.5 per cent reinsurance is bein?
paid on her.
The British ship Godiva Is now under
going repairs at Mission street wharf. She
got a terrible battering off the Horn in
October laet. and now her bulwarks have
to be repaired, new stanchions put In. a
new poop stairway erected, a 'new sky
light put over the cabin and sundry oth<--r
repairs that will take a couple of weeks
to make. The repairs are being made by
Hhc Risdcn Iron works, and they will l>e
completed OS soon as the ship Is ready for
stiffening. ThÂ« Godiva Is under charter
to lond wheat for Europe.
The Mall steamer Newport .will sail for
Panama and way ports loaded to the
guards with merchandise. The Mail Com
pany has bÂ«*?n /slashing rates right and

freight that was being held for the Kos
mos steamer Volumnla was secured. The

the present tariff Is supposed to be a protective tariff, but
Is one that does not protect, and therefore should be re

Important Suit Over
Street Railroads.
11. G. Walker, by his attorney, H. A.
Aldrich, to-day filed a suit for $200 dam
ages against the Oakland Transit Com
pany for failure upon the part of the com
pany to carry him through to his destina
tion at night.
Walker says that he got on a car of the
Transit Company's system, intending to
transfer to the Piedmont division. The
last car on the Piedmont division did not
wait for his car or the cars on that line
did not run as late as the cars on the
other line, and he had to go home in a
hack. He holds that railroads are com
pelled to carry their passengers to their
destination when they once accept fare
from them.
This raises an Interesting question, be
cause street railroads frequently stop the
service on their branch lines before they
do that on their main lines. Mr. Walker's
suit will settle whether this can be done
or not.
In view of this suit It is of Interest to
know that the Supreme Court will render
a decision on February 5 upon the famous
cults of "Stop-over Robinson" against th 1 ;
Southern Pacific Company. When the
Southern Pacific Company put the gates
on their local trains Robinson and his
family claimed that they had the right
to get stop-over privileges at each station
on the local system. They were of course
refused the privilege, and for weeks they
pursued the policy of demanding and hav
ing refused this privilege. For every re
fusal they filed a damage suit for $200.
and as they had Â£500 cases their claims
lor damages amounted to $560,000.
These suits were brought, some In Oak
land, some in Alameda and some in San
Francisco. Judge Sanderson forced all
of the cases Into one, so that all of the
claims will stand or fall upon the decision
of the Supreme Court next month.
acid. Morgue Chemist Green finished his
analysis of the contents of the stomach
yesterday at noon and reported to Coro
ner Cole that he had found carbolic acid
in the stomach. The Coroner was loth
to believe that a member of a religious
order, and one who had lived a self-sac
rifielng life, would make way with her
self, and in order that mere might not be
any mistake requested Morgue Surgeon
Leland to make an autopsy of the wo
man's brain.
Dr. Leland completed the autopsy short
ly before a o'clock and reported that the
brain was normal, and that there were
no traces of apoplexy. Dr. Leland will
testify at the inquest that carbolic acid
poisoning was the cause of Sister Cora's
death. The inquest will be held at 10
o'clock this morning and all the facts will
be brought out.
It has since been learned that Sister
Cora called on a friend last Sunday even
ing at the Bella Vista Hotel and was very
much depressed over the prospect that
her work at St. Alban's Episcopal Mission
would cease at the end of the month,
and that she would then be without ac
tive employment. She had received an
offer to assist Bishop Rowe In Alaska,
but feared that at her advanced age she
would not be able to stand the severity
of the climate.
The deceased was a noble hearted wo
man, as an incident which has Just come
to light will Illustrate. A young man
named Cameron, about 20 years old, and
said to be a relative of Police Captain
Dirdsall, was studying for the ministry.
Ho was poor and had barely enough
means to pull him through. Sister Cora
was well acquainted with him and his
family, and with that unselfish generos
ity characteristic of the devout Christian,
assisted him out of her slender means
from time to time. She often wore broken
shoes and patched dresses because of her
desire to help worthy persona In whom
she took an interest. . .

STORY OF WRONG TOLD
BY A RUSSIAN SAILOR
ACCUSES CAPTAIN WESTON OF
THE LYDEBHOBN.
Alleges That He Was Assaulted by
the Mate and Defrauded Out.
of His Wages.
Oscar Haak visited the office of United
States District Attorney Coombs yester
day and poured into the attentive ear of
Assistant District Attorney Banning a
doleful tale of "sailor men" being abused
and robbed by pirates of the sea.
Haak is a Russian with a German
twist and is as patient as a lamb. His
story is that five months ago he shipped
at Hamburg for a three years' cruise a?
"bo's'n" on the then good ship Lyder
horn, flying the British flag. His articles
called for four pounds sterling per month.
On arriving at this port two weeks ngj
ho received four pounds wages and was
run off the vessel by the mate, who was
armed with a cutlass and a belaying pin.
Haak is a timid man. He is not the
type of Russians of which Nihilists are
made, and the mate scared him so much
that he fled from the vessel, leaving his
cap behind. He says the mate swore
that he would brain him with the belay
ing pin and slice him into ham sar.vl
wiches with the cutlass If he ever dared
to come on board the ship again.
Haak says further that he went to the
British Consul and -told hitÂ» story, but
that he received no relief or hope of any.
He Fays other members of the <jrew wÂ»-rÂ«Â»
partially paid off and dismissed from the
vessel, their places being filled with a
fresh crew.
Bert Schlesinger has taken up the sail
or's case and brought suit yesterday af
ternoon to recover damages from Cop
tain Weston, mate of the Lyderhorn. for
breach of contract and the amount of
three years' wagea less the four pounds
which Haak admits having received.
Police Judge Fritz yesterday Issued a
John Doe warrant for the arrest of the
mate on a charge of battery.
rHE hide and leather men of San Francisco do not al
low the grass to grow under their feet when they are
called upon to take action to protect their interests.
An illustration of their promptitude in this regard wad
given yesterday afternoon, when they were called together
in the rooms of the Board of Trade for the purpose of
taking steps to secure the abrogation by Congress of the
duty on hides.
There were only about a dozen present at the meeting,
but they were all representatives of big tanneries and
leather firms and they knew what they were the^re for.
Before they had fairly taken their seats Herbert Kullman,
secretary of Kullman. Salz & Co.. had been elected tem
porary chairman, and had taken the floor to state the ob
ject of the gathering. W. 11. Purtelle, editor of the Pa
cific shoe and Leather Journal, was elected temporary sec
retary after Mr. Kullman had finished his remarks, which
were brief and to the point.
The chairman xas authorized to appoint a committee

OPINIONS DIFFER AS TO WHETHER
IT WILL IMPROVE OR NOT.
Henry Clews* New York circular says:
"While the rtock market Is In an intrinsically
Bovni condition the long desired advance has
been deferred for reasons that are somewhat
perplexing to the average operator. The beet
explanation that can be offered is the wide
divergence of opinion respecting the future
course of prices. ' Those who believe In a higher
market argue that liquidation has been Bevere;
that Mocks have largely passed from weaker
Into etronger hands; that prices are consid
erably below the t*>st of 1559; that prosperity
continues throughout the country without signs
of abating; that the great railroad systems
and Industrial concerns are enjoying good
â¢Â¦amities; that there is a good demand for
labor; that wages In the lower departments of
labor have riwn; that money Is easier; that
the Bank of England rate has been reduced
from * to I per cent and the Bank of France
from 4% to 4 per cent; that funds are coming
"to New York; that there is little to fear from
Congress pending a Presidential election; In
ehort, that a laree majority of the Influences
which control prices are In favor of an ad
vance.
"On the other hand there are many, and
their number is Increasing, who believe recent
liquidation was necessary and beneficial: that
a great number of buyers were crippled by
the December panic, and now have neither
the ar>illty nor disposition to re-enter the mar
ket; that some of the big cliques which con
trol the situation are not ready for an ad
vance; that the Trantsvaal war. with the pros
pect of long continuance and a large Issue
of consols, is an effectual hindrance to any
bull campaign; that the old rates for money
will not be renewed; that the higher level, of
Interest rates is against maintaining fancy
prices for securities paying small returns; that
the present activity in business cannot continue
much longer without receiving set-backs; In
ehort. that present and prospective prosperity
has been amply discounted, and that a period
of reet is required for recuperation of force
and readjustment of values.
"Of the two positions we have no hesitation
about expressing our belief In the former, or
Jn an ultimately higher market. There Is,
however, sufficient force In the argument of
the other eide to command attention and In
duce caution. At the moment there Is little
disposition to buy etocks, and some fresh stim
ulus is needed to attract the outside public.
Among. the big leaders there Is no appearance
of concerted action, such as is neceÂ«sary to
any bull campaign: on the contrary, there are
etro/jg evidences that some of them are work-

eeeure a larger line of long stocks. The Boer
war has become an.important indirect Influence
upon the American markets, inasmuch as an
issue of consols, which seems inevitable and
which would be considered desirable invest
ments by a certain class of buyers abroad,
would certainly cause more or less selling of
high grade securities, American as well as
others. Little concern Is felt about any pros
pective drain upon our gold supplies, for the
reason that they are ample to meet all prob
able requirements. A decisive British victory
might cause a sharp rally In the stock market,
but it should not be overlooked thfir the British
have an exceedingly difficult task before them
in capturing Pretoria, involving as it must
the cost of much life and treasure."
NEW YORK. Jan. 17.â The stock market con
tinued dull and without much life, but there
was an unmistakable undertone of strength
and the character of the small buying demand
showed a substantial improvement. Dealings
in the highly speculative industrials still pre
dominated, but the proportions of the dealings
in them were not so excessive. There was
a notable movement In the Leather stocks
early in the day. but it was not well sus
tained. Third Avenue suffered a violent de
cline of 6U points, but recovered 314. Other
wise the group manifested strength under the
influence of covering by the outstanding short
interest, who were Influenced by the general
strength of the market. Reports of a military
success for the British made the London mar
ket strong and was reflected here. The up
ward course of sterling exchange and exchange
on Paris served somewhat to neutralize this
influence in spite of the continued fall in the
English discount rate. The decided improve
ment In the buying of railroads was con
spicuous In the Grangers. Southern Pacific and
Baltimore and Ohio, though the latter stock
met free offerings to realize. The railroad list
generally was benefited sympathetically by this
strength. The St. Paul statement for the
second week in January encouraged buying in
view of the increase of $311,555 over last year's
earnings, which in turn had been greater than
the year before by $144,355. The supplementary
report of the Baltimore and Ohio for the six
months ending December 31, IS&9. was an In
fluence of strength, with a surplus of interests
and rentals for that period of $1,201,513. State
ments on authority of the account of the
Southern Pacific stock by Union Pacific in
terests helped the market for railroads. The
increased grain movement, a good export de
mand for wheat and the continued increase in
the money supply were all factors of strength.
So also was the statement of the country's
foreign trade for December. The preliminary
statement of agricultural exports had shown
a decrease from last December of $26.212.36S
and as the total exports for the month showed
a decrease for December of IS9B of only $14,505.
431 the difference is attributed to increase in
the exports of manufactured products, to the
amount of $11,646,937. Taking the calendar year
as a whole the decline in the excess of mer
chandise exports is about offset by the decline
in excess of gold imports, leaving the favor
able balance of trade about the same as the
year before.
Business in bonds was not heavy, but prices
were firm. Total sales, par value, $1,225,000.
United States 4s advanced U In the bid price.

NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here to-day were strong on the
closing of bear commitments. Consols spurted
1 1-16, influenced by cheap money and the as
sumption that news from the Transvaal In the
Immediate future will be favorable. Other
wise the markets were Idle and of hard tone.
London bought Americans on a small scale.
As anticipated yesterday gold was engaged to
day for India. Â£256.000 being taken, while
Â£100,000 was ear-marked for currency commis
rion. For an unannounced destination Â£10,000
was engaged. The Bank of England got Â£5000
in eagles. The week's influx of gold was
Â£5000. More shipments to India are certain.
The country is trying to secure the gold It
requlreo from Australia, but the exchange mar
ket indicates that London must bear the whole
burden. Â¦ â¢
Money continues superabundant at the rates
prevailing during the last few days and bills
are still easy.
Continental exchange was as follows: Paris,
25.25; Berlin, 20.5014. There was some profit
taking in the silver market, but prices are
not expected to go lower.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â After the deluge of
liquidation which marked the two preceding
sessions of the Board of Trade the opening
to-day found a crowd of shorts ready to cover
on slight provocation. There was a general
feeling, too, that, a decline of 214 c would in
the natural course of things be partly re
gained. The relatively small loss at Liverpool
compared with 1%@114e loss here yesterday
combined with light Northwest receipts, coa
stltuted a sufficient excuse for buylnr by
shorts. May opened %c over yesterday with
trade active. The outside demand was small
but the local buying pressure wast sufficient
to Influence an advance. May ascending to 66c
At this point the market met free sellinr
against calls. This, together with a rumor of
a British victory in South Africa caused a re
action. May selling off to 65%@6514c. The mar
ket steadied on buying against puts and again
advanced, a fresh demand having arisen, car
rylnsr May to 6C@66!4c. The close was firm
May WKc over yesterday at 65% c. Though
quiet at times trade was active generally

BOSTON. Jan. 17.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrrow:
The wool market Is quiet, although the vol
ume of business transacted during the last
week hxs slightly exceeded that of the pre
vious week, and during the past two or three
days especially some of the- manufacturers
have manifested a little more Interest in the
market. But they are not free purchasers of
wool by any means, and the entire week's busi
ness foots up a total of less than 3.000,000
pounds. As a result of the dullness experienced
since the beginning of last December there has
been mere pressure to sell, and as a matter
of fact it has been possible to purchase wool in
several Instances at terms slightly below what
It had been previously selling' for. In other
cases, however, wool has sold at as high prices
as were obtained durins the recent boom. The
London tales which opened on Thursday were
a disappointment, as merinos experienced a
decline of 5 per cent and crossbreeds were
Flishtly weaker. The sales of the week in
Boston amounted to 2.570.000 pounds domestic
and 335,000 foreign, making a total of 2,965.000
against a total of 2.565.000 for the previous week
and a total of 2,65f>,500 for the corresponding
week last year. The sales since January 1
amount to 8,363,600 pounds, -against 9.692,000
pounds for the corresponding time last year.

2054nltely provided for by Shakespeare in
which 240 people took part as vestals, llc
tors, swordbearers, standard-bearers, etc.,
besides the reg-ular dramatis personae of
thirty-five members, and besides also
crowds to represent citizens, spectators,
etc.
It is evident, then, that the full meas
ure of enjoyment which "Cortolanus" af
fords as a play can rarely be obtained
from seelig It acted. In reading "Cori
olanus" scarcely a line seems possible to
be spared, and yet, as we have seen, two
fifths of It at least has to be cut out in
acting. On the other hand, the greatness
of the two principal characters of the
play. Coriolanus and Volumnia. can only
be "guessed at by a reader who has never
seen them Impersonated by genius.
The honors of "Coriolanus" as an act-
Ing play belong to John Philip Kemble
and his sister, the great Mrs. Siddons. It
Is doubtful if ever an actor has appeared
upon the stage whose impersonation of
the Roman character has been so com
plete as were the Roman impersonations
of John Kemble. And of all of Kemble s
Roman charactersâ Brut us. Cato, Corlo
lanus, etc.â his Coriolanus was chief. Co
riolanus was indeed Kemble's greatest,
grandest part. His tall and Imposing fig
ure his countenance, noble and dignified :
his solemn and grave demeanor, his easy
yet commanding gestures, his stately and
impressive elocution,, were the complete
realization of all the external requisite^*
of the part. But, In addition, he evinced,
by his development of the all-absorbing
passion dominant In Corlolanus' charac
ter, such energy and force as made his
Impersonation Irresistible.
Mrs Siddons' Volumnia was second only
to her Constance and her Lady Macbeth.
The great tragedienne was notably strong
in pantomime, and the part of Volumnia,
especially as John Kemble provided for it
in his version of "Coriolanus," allowed
the display of very considerable panto
mimic power. Let us listen for a mo
ment to what an eyewitness, the trage
dian. Charles Mayne Young, wrote of her
as she appeared in the triumphal proces
sion in "Coriolanus" above referred to:
I remember her coming down the stage. In
1789. in the triumphal entry of her son. Oorto
lanuÂ« when her dumb show drew plaudits that
shook the building (Drury Lane). She came
alone, marching and beating time to the music,
rolling (If that be not too strong a term to de
scribe her motion) from side to side, swelling
with the triumph of her son. Such was the
Intoxication of Joy which flashed from her eyes
and lit up her whole face that the effect waa
Irresistible. She seemed to me to reap all the
glory of that proceoslon to herself. I could not
take my eyes frcm her. Corlolanus. banner and
pageant, all went for nothing after she had
walked to her place.
The following Is another account of the
same event:
Vow In this procession, and one of the cen
tral figures In It. Mrs. Siddons had to walk.
Had ahe been content to follow In the beaten
track of those who had gone before her she
would have marched across the stage, from
right to left, with the solemn, stttely. almost
funereal step conventional. But at the time, as
she often did. rhe forgot her own Identity. ShÂ«
was no longer Sarah Siddons, tied down to the
directions of the prompter's book. She broke
through all traditions. She recollected that, for
the nonce she was Volumnia, the proud mother
of a proud and conquering hero. So that, when
It was time for her to come on, instead of drop
ping each foot at equl-dlstance in its place,
with mechanical exactitude and in cadence sub-
Bersient to the orchestra, deaf to the guidance
of her woman's ear, but sensitive to the throb
bings of her haughty mother's heart, with
flashing eye and proudest smile, and head
erect and hands pressed firmly on her bosom, as
If to repress by manual force Its triumphant
Bweillngs â she towered above all around, and
rolled, and almost reeled, across the stage, her
very soul, as It were, dilating and rtotlng In Us
exultation, until her action lost all grace, and
yet became Â»o true to nature, so picturesque
and so descriptive that pit and gallery sprang
to their feet, electrified by the transcendent
execution of the conception.
The above descriptions refer to a time
when Mrs. Siddons was only 33 years old,
and her brother (who took the part of Co
rlolanus) 33. Some critics thought that
the Volumnia of the occasion looked more
like the sister than the mother of Co
riolanus. But this fault was easily over
looked in the excellence of the Impersona
tion as a whole. *
As to Kemble's Coriolanua, the testi
mony as to its greatness is equally strong.
Macready, who saw it many times, speaks
of it in his "Reminiscences as "peerless."
Genest, the well-known historian of the
British stage, calls' it "his greatest part."
Sir Walter Scott, who was not only an
admirer of Kemble's but also an intimate
friend of his. spoke of his Brutus, his
Cato and his Coriolanus as being "his
best parts," but placed his Corlolanus
first. "You know what a complete model
of the Roman he is," he wrote to a friend
on the occasion of Kemble's retirement.
The Kemblesâ John, Charles and Mrs.
Siddonsâ were frequently called "The
Three Graces." Both the brothers pos
sessed much of the classical beauty of
their greater sister. When John Kemble
first appeared on the London stage the
general remark was. "How- very like his
sister!" But Charles Kemble was hand
somer even than his brother. Leigh Hunt
said of him mat "his face and figure were
ideal" and that "he was the nearest ap
proach to Shakespeare's gentlemen and
heroes of romance ' he had ever seen. The
three constituted a trio such as no other
family has ever given to the stage.
"Coriolanus" was first brought out by
John Kemble In Drury Lane in 1759. It
was again brought out by him in Covent
Garden in ISO 6. It was also the great play
THEATER ROYAL, DRURY LANE.
character In which he took hl3 leava of thÂ»
stage, waa one of the first In which we remem
ber to have seen him. and It waa one in which
wÂ« were not sorry to part with him. for wfc
wished to see htm appear like himself to thÂ»
last. Nor waa he wanting to himself on this
occasion. He played the part as well as ho
ever did â with as much freshness and vigtir.
There was no abatement of spirit and energy,
none of grace and dignity. His look, h'.a actions,
his expression of the character were the smrw
as they ever were. They could not be finer.
John Kemble was then in his sixty-rtrst
year. His career, taken all in all (with
the possible exception of Macreaily's>, was
the most honorable and successful la thd
history of the British stage.
Of great players In the part of Corio
lanus since John Kemble there have been
a number, though not many. Kean playej
the part in 1820, on the occasion when for
the first time the text of Shakespeare waa
wholly used, but Coriolanus waa oot one
of Kean's successes. It was much leas
meritorious than his Brutus. For one
thing, Kean's inferior figure was not suit
ed to the part. Macready also played
Coriolanus, and played it Â¦well. Barry
Cornwall. the poet, declared of It. Quot
ing Shakespeare: "This is the noblest

SALTY WATERS
Mrs. Mary Schutter
Was Despondent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 17.
While in a fit of despondency Mrs. Mary
Schutter. aged 3S years and of respectable
appearance, attempted to jump off the
ferry boat Berkeley on its last trip from
San Francisco last night, but her attempt
at suicide was frustrated by the deck
hands.
She was given into the custody of the
Oakland police and was detained all day
at the Cliy Prison in the hope that some
friend or relative could be located. To
night she was removed to the Receiving
Hospital. She will be examined for in
sanity to-morrow.
To the police Mrs. Schutter stated that
she was confined in Agnews Insane Asy
lum about a year ago and wishes to be
sent back there. She complains that her
head troubles her a great deal; that she
had become too weak to work any longer
and that she had therefore concluded to
end her misery by jumping off opposite
Goat Island. Mrs. SchUtcer admltteu tnai
she once before, prior to her commitment
to Agnews, made an attempt to end her
life.
The prison officials at first were doubt
ful as to her dementia and suggested that
If she so desired she could leave the
prison. The woman, however, broke down
in tears, declaring that she did not know
where to go if released: but she was will-
Ing to be recommitted to Agnews, where
she would resume work In the laundry of
the hospital for the Insane.
The woman's husband is said to be a
barber in San Francisco, but she claims
she was compelled to leave him because
he refused to contribute to her suvport.

X. CORIOLAUTJS.
The Play as an Acting Drama.
The play of "Coriolanus" is never acted
as Shakespeare wrote it. To begin with,
it is much too long for the exigencies of
the modern stage. At least two-fifths
must be omitted in any modern repre
sentation of the play. Again, for nearly
150 years theatrical managers did not have
confidence in Shakespeare's work In ".Cor
iolanus" and conjoined with his work the
work of other playwrights. During the
whole period, say from the time of the
reformation (1660, and, for all we know,
even from Shakespeare's own time) down
to the year IS2O, "Coriolanus" was not
brought out once even nominally, as
Shakespeare's play. In 17-19 a play on the
same subject was produced In Covent
Garden, written by James Thomson, the
poet, the author of "The Seasons" and
"The Castle of Indolence." It is a sort
of combination of Shakespeare's play and
Thomson's play, compiled in the main by
Thomas Sheridan (the father of Sheridan
the dramatist), and improved and amend
ed by John Philip Kemble, that has had
most vogue upon the stage.
"Coriolanus" Is likewise too complex In
its construction, too indirect in Us dra
matic movement, to be a very effective
play for acting, except under conditions
that admit of great spectacular and scenic
display. As an illustration of this it may
be mentioned that when Kemble produced
it he introduced a procession not defl-
In his repertoire in his last year upon the
stage (1SIT). when, however, the part of
Volumnia iMrs. Siddons having retired
from the stage) was taken by Mrs. Fau
clt. the mother of Helen Faueit. Also It
was the play he chose for his farewell
appearance In Edinburgh, where he was
a great favorite. Finally. It was the play
he chose for his last appearance In Covent
Garden, in his "ever-memorable farewell
to the stage." June 23. 1817.
Of that last appearance John Howard
Payne, the dramatist and player (author
of "Home, Sweet Home"), wrote:
I can never forget Kemble's Coriolanus. His
entree wÂ»Â» t*e> most brilliant I ever wltnÂ»sÂ»ed.
His person derived a majesty from a scarlet
robe, which hÂ« managed with Inimitable dignity.
Tha Roman energy of his deportment, the se
raphic grace of his gesture an d the movements
of his perfect self-possession displayed the
great mind, daring to command, and tii?dain
in* to sotlclt. admiration. His form derived an
additional elevation of perhaps two tnchea from
his sandals. In even' part of th<* house the
audience roee. waved their hatÂ» and huzzaed,
and the oheerlnK must have lasted more- than
five minutes.
Hazlitt, thf critic, gives a mere detailed
account of that memorable evening:
Mr. Ktrable took his leave of the stags on
Monday night, in the character of Ctirlnlanu?.
On his' Srrt coming forward to pronounce his
farewell he was received with a shcut Uk*
thunder. Cm his retiring after it, th# applaus*
was lonÂ«r before it subsided entirely away.

we first saw Mr. Kemhl-? In thp same rh.iracter;
yet how Rhort thÂ» interval seema. The Impres
sion seerrs as distinct as if it were yestenlay.
â¢ â¢ â¢ we forget numberless thinus. but
not the first time we saw Mr. Kemb'.e. nor
shall we easily forget the last. Coriolanus. the
Luck Is blamed with a lot of misfor-
tunes of which it Is ignorant.

Hurt by a Gas Explosion.
Joseph K.'ihn, who resides at 28 Landers
street and is employed by the IndependS
ent Electric Light Company, was severe
ly burned about the face last night by
an explosion of gas. He was in the act
of lifting the Cover oft a manhole at the
corner of Sacramento and Montgomery
streets, when the gas which had gener
ated within the enclosure became ignited
from the lantern he carried, and a ter
rific explosion resulted. The unfortunate
man- was knocked off his feet by the
shock. He was taken to a near-by drug
store, where his injuries were treated. He
then left for his home.
ANOTHER VERSION
OF "DON CAESAR"
DON CAESAR OF IRUN" suffers in
comparison with that good old tuney
household opera, "Maritana," which
It resembles as much as a twenty
five-cent piece resembles a shilling. The
story is the same and th.c dialogue so like
that were it not for the musical interrup
tions one might think that one were hear
ing Wallace's composition. It Is the music
that is disappointing.
Dellinger does not display a melodic in
vention that grabs the fancy, and in spite
of some well-made ensembles the opera is
musically monotonous. It is not to bo
wondered that with such uninspiring ma
terial the chorus at the Grand is at a
disadvantage and sings with a raggednesa
that is as painful as it is unusual.
Persse ac Don Caesar is quite at home,
though as spiritless as ever. There is lit
tle to say of the other principals, except
that Wolff is given another chance to take
himself seriously in the part of Don Fer
nandez, which is a condition of thlng3
that is always fatal to him, unless the
opportunity for serious work be positively
important.
There is a crying need of new principals
at the Grand Opera-house. Not a whole-
Bale change, but at least the introduction
of one new face. Some one who can take
a leading part, some one who can attract
and please. This would mean a much
needed rest for some one, too, and there
is not a singer in the bunch that woulu
not profit by it.
Stage Manager Jones has been indus
triously praised for his work with South-,
well and Morosco, and he is undoubtedly
clever within the scope of his ideals, but
verily he should give us pause in the mat
ter of marches and the like. He carries
the American idea of drilling the chorus
to excess and his girls are forever going
through intricate evolutions and marking
time with their graceful extremities. Thi3
sort of thing becomes ridiculous, for ex
ample, when "Don Caesar" sings a fare
well to his sword, which by the way is a
poor substitute for "Farewell, My Gallant
Captain" of "Maritana," and is encom
passed on all sides by a marching mass of
misses brilliantly bedight. Mr. Jones also
revels in impossible tableaux. It is a pity
his talent should be so perverted.

ORDINANCE AGAINST
TURNTABLES SIGNED
Mayor Phelan yesterday signed the or
der prohibiting the use of turntables at
crossings, and in order to appease the
wrath of the Market Street Railway Com
pany, which is directly Interested In the
matter, sent along letter of explanation
to that corporation. In it he stated that
he had carefully considered the objections
made to the adoption of the order. He
said that turntables were confessedly a
nuisance and a danger. He called special
attention to the Geary street turntable
and answered the railway's plea that to
change the construction of its roadbed
would be an additional expense, which it
did not wish to incur at this time, as its
franchise would fall due In two and a .half
years, by saying he had come to the con
clusion that the people who use the
streets, whose number at the junction of
Market and Geary streets is immeasur
ably greater than those that use the cars,
should first be considered. In conclusion
he said:
"In consultation with the City Engineer
I find what is possibly a temporary rem
edy in turning the cars at the V tracks
at Grant avenue and Geary street. Or
perhaps your engineer's department can
find some way of shifting the grip so that
It will fit on the return trip and then
adopt the means employed by the Sutter
street and California street companies to
meet the difficulties arising: out of the po
sition of the slot. For the mere conven
ience of the operation of the road econ
omically I do not desire to take the re
sponsibility of standing in the way of so
important a public improvement as is in
volved in the removal of the objection
able turntables."

until 1898, when the husband, who is a

wife that his business would call him to
Australia. She made no objections and
he Backed his clothes and left: Shortly
afterward Mrs. Foye learned to her aston
ishment'that the husband had not left the
city, but had taken up a residence with
his sister. When Mrs. Foye wrote him
demanding an explanation she received
the curt reply that she could sue for a
divorce on any old grounds. She prompt
ly chose desertion as her grievance, and
there was no contest offered. Judge Ells
worth, who granted the decree, has or
dered Foye to pay $35 monthly alimony.

POLICE SECURE
WARRANTS FOR
THREE CHINESE
Stabbed a Suey Sing
Highbinder.
No mur*?r marked the passing of yes
terday in Chinatown. There were hired
murderers, nevertheless, prowling about
in search of their victims, but before
three of them could earn the heathen's
reward for the taking, of life they were
taken by the police and lodged behind the
bars. Chinatown was in a state of unrest
such as has never been experienced before
and it is admitted by leading Chinese au
thorities that the merchants have under
taken too great a task in attempting to
prevent further hostilities. The startling
admission was made to the acting chief of
police last night that all of the men killed
thus far in the trouble have been Hop
Sing men and that the Suey Sings have
scarcely suffered in return. The only man
of the latter tong who has been injured
was Lee Wong, who was cut in the hand
by three men Sunday night on "Waverly
place. Last night the police secured war
rants for the three Hop Sing men who
did the cutting. They are Yee Me, Yee
Quong Hing and Ah Jew. All have been
located, and their arrests will follow soon.
A special reward of $00 for each man has
been offered by the merchants.
The Hop Sing Toiur has positively re
fused to abandon the struggle. At the
meetings called for the purpose of adjust
ing a peaceful settlement they have re
fused to attend or to consent to even an
other truce. Whether they can be forced
into submission remains in the prospec
tive, but the chances are that they can
not until they have taken as many of
their rivals' lives as have been sacrificed
from their own ranks.
Last night acting Chief of Police Biggy
was invited to attend a meeting of the Six
Companies. He had refused on other oc
casions to be present until the Chinese
should grant him certain concessions, and
it was only upon the promise that his re
quests would be granted that he listened
to any of their propositions last night.
Another meeting has been arranged for
to-day, and the acting Chief stated that
if things materialize as he expects them
to the war will be declared oil before 12
o'clock Friday night. It is understood
that the Six Companies' have agreed to
appoint six Chinese detectives to gather
and furnish evidence against the murder
ers and to turn them over to the law. The
detectives will be paid by the companies
and will receive $35 per month. An effort
will also be made to capture the presi
dents of the leading tongs.
There are but twenty men in this city
who have been committing any crime.
Some of them are now serving terms for
carrying concealed weapons, and if the
merchants keep their faith with the police
and turn the others over to the law
trouble may be quelled. This is regarded
as the only solution for the criminal prob
lem, and the influence of the merchants
will have but little weight with the en
raged Hop Sings.
Last night squads of officers under act-
Ing Chief Biggy and Captain Wittman
visited the highbinder resorts and arrest
ed a number of Chinamen who could pro
duce no certificate provided for by the
exclusion act. In this matter the police
have the assistance of the Federal au
thorities and if the highbinder war con
tinues about one-fourth of the inhabitants
of Chinatown will be deported. The
women who were: arrested in bouses of
ill-repute were allowed to return to their
resorts as they have no other home, but
they were required to keep their doors
open and no other persons were allowed
admittance.
Detective George McMahon and Officer
Burke were detailed by the acting: Chief
to watch for highbinders, who now come
from the suburbs of the town to commit
their crimes. They succeeded in. captur

Now comes all the complications, which
hinge upon the money which the Widow
Spiars is supposed to have had, and which
she says she has not got. . But whether
she had or had not the money, the sus
picion that she had seems to have caused
all kinds of trouble. Mrs. Lane says
that her husband has deserted her for
the -wealth of Mrs. Spiars, and she wants
some of Mrs. Spiars' wealth in return
for damaged affections. Edward Lane,
the husband, says that it was because
his brother, William Lane, wanted to get
Mrs. Spiars' wealth that all this hap
pened, and Mrs. Spiars says that it is an
effort upon the part of William Lane
and Mrs. Edward Lane to get some of
the wealth that she has not got. Then
she charges blackmail.
"This is nothing but a blackmailing
suit," said Mrs. Spiars. "They think
that . I have some money, when I
have not, and they are trying to get it.
I am old and alone, and they think I am
an easy prey. Some time ago Mrs. Lane,
who is now sumg 1 me, asked me to loan
her $400. which I did. This is the reward
I get. William Lane tried to rent a room
in my house Home time ago. and I re
fused to let him. Then he put up Mrs.
Edward Lane against me. I believe that
he wants to get my money. Some few
weeks ago Edward Lone came to my
house and rented a room for a short time.
They were very crowded at his house,
his mother being sick. Since that time
Mrs. Lane has quarreled with me. and
advantage was taken of that to get her
to bring this suit."
"I am sorry to say that I believe that
my brother is at the bottom of this," said
Edward Lane. "Some time ago our house
became crowded because my mother was
received information that a shooting had
been booked to take place at the exact
place where the men were taken. Both
carried large revolvers. Another high
binder was discovered by Officer Gill,
turning into Commercial street from
Kearny. Before he could be captured he
cast the weapon away and it was not re
covered by the police.

â Â»
THE UNIVERSITY'S NEW ERA
A Promise Extended That the New
Buildings Will Be Begun This
Year and Speedily Brought
to Completion.
?
BERKELEY, Jan. 17.â "The New Era,"
that was the burden of the student dem
onstrations and the faculty addresses and
the congratulations and exhortations of
the regents at the big student reception to
Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst in Hearst Hall to
r.ight. It was to a new and larger order
of things architecturally, intellectually
and patriotically to which the speakers
referred and for nrhich thtir enthusiastic
auditors cheered, and ail of it centered
around Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst, to whom
this student reception was given and who
has dune so much to create this "new
era."
It was a welcome to Berkeley for Mrs.
Hearst, who lias taken up her residence
in this city, where she can be near the
work she has chosenâ the advancement of
the State University. The students and
the faculty and all connected with the
university and its surroundings, wanted
to pay their respects to the woman who
began their "new era," and so the wel
come was extended en masse in the form
of a gigantic reception participated in by
the faculty of the university and the stu
dents of both sexes.
It was most lining- that it should have
heÂ«n given in Hearst Hall, the new au
2itorium erected by Mrs. Hearst and dedi
cated to the students' use. This was the
only place in town of sufficient size to ac
c-ommodate those who wished to pay their
respects to the only woman regent.
It was a tremendous crowd that filled
the seating capacity of the hall and over
flowed into the aisles and lined up ten
deep in the rear of the room.
As Mrs. Hearst's party entered from the
covered passageway a ringing shout an
nounced the fact and the yell-leadei
railod for three cheers from the students,
and followed it up with an "oskey wow
wow" that shook the roof.
The cheers had hardly died away when
Fred Dorety. the president of the asso
ciated students, toolt the center of the
room and introduced the speakers, the
tirst of whom was Professor E. B. Clapp,
head of the Greek department.
Professor Clapp spoke of the happy dif
ference between the present outlook and
that of five years since, remarking that
the great difference lay In the fact that
the university, including students, grad
aates, faculty and regents, are united un
der a leadtr who commands confidence
iind under the influence of the kindliness
and beneficence of a benefactress whom
ill are proud to welcome also as a friend.
Professor Clapp's address was followed
by a selection by the Ladles' Glee ClubÂ»
which the boys gallantly encored, render
ing thanks in unison. Then followed
*hort speeches by Clinton R. Miller, Ralph
Fisher, L. Dupont Syle and Ezra de Cato,
in which the football team, the track ath
letes and the basebaJl enthusiasts all
came in for commendation and applause.
Regent J. B. Reinstein spoke at length
on tfiÂ» Hearst architectural plans, giving
a history of their inception and growth
and present status. "The first impetus
to the movement." he said, "that resulted
in the architectural competition was given
by the students themselves. The specta
cle presented by these loyal 6ons of Cali
fornia as they seized th,e pick and shovel
and took the first step toward the beau
tifying of the campus moved the friends
of the university everywhere to plan for
the adequate equipment of the university
and finally led to the suggestion of a
general plan of buildings.
"Mrs. Hearst had rc-peatedly been Im
portuned for gifts of buildings, but wit*i
a wisdom commensurate with her gener
osity she steadily refused until a differ
ent s*>t of conditions should prevail. When
the idea of a general plan had matured
Mrs. Hearst sent that memorable letter
that crystallized the movement into defin
ite form and made possible the acquis:
tion of our present eplendid set or de
signs.
'These designs will be altered by M.
Benard to euit the conditions as observed
by him on his recent visit to Berkeley and
a provisional final set will be presented
by the 1st of April. Â¦ These will be ex
amined by the regents and returned to
Parts. By the 1st of October the com
pleted plans will be in the hands of the
repents.
"I want to say to any who are disposed
to complain of the delay In putting the
plans into execution that the first of these
buildings will be begun before the end
of the present year. The entire scheme
of building will be erected, and that soon.
Nor will the cost be disproportionate to
the expense of the training carried on
within those walls."
This announcement of the plans of Mrs.
Ht>arst was greeted with generous ap
plause.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler fol
lowed and said in part:
"Berkeley is delighted. We wanted Mrs.
Hearst to come and live with us here.
We needed this building. . We needed the
other generous projects which Mrs.
Hearst, unlike those who can merely
ptand at a distance and contemplate, was
and is able to grandly accomplish. It la a
great thing to be a student in the Uni
versity of California. Be proud of her.
Cheer for her. Live for her."
Mrs. Hearst did not make any address,
but quietly received the congratulations
and welcomes of those who met her.
The student committee of arrangements
consisted of Miss Gertrude Jewett, Miss
Ruth Wilder. Miss Eva Powell, Fred G.
Dorety, W. A. Shuey and Eccleston B.
Marsh.

Lkind." retorted McEnerney. "plans and
specifications? Do you want tha name
of every man in the department? What
are you going to do?" '
"Nothing," said the Mayor, and that
was the way he bought and sold the Flra
Department of this city for votes. And
he dare not deny it In a court of Jus
tice.
These are facts and charges that ought
to cover Mayor Phelan In humillatioa
and shame. But what has he done to de
fend himself? He complains in pleading
that The Call threatens to expose his
private character. The Call has attempt
ed to do nothing <?f the sort. It knows
nothing of his private character and
does not want to know. But what i 3
there in it that will not bear the light of
inquiry? â¢
Seeking to cloud the serious Issue that
he has forced upon the people of the city
Mayor Phelan says that he has been at
tacked because he would not appoint tho
proprietor of this paper a memoer of tho
Police Commission. In this he tells a de
liberate, malicious lie that possesses no
more signincance than its cheap cunning.
He declares that had it not been for the
objection of M. H. de Young he would
have appointed the proprietor of The Call
to the commission. Again he lies, as M.
H. de Young declares that he voiced no
objection to any appointment.
Frantic in his desire to escape the con
sequences of his official crime, he raises
the smoke of religious controversy that
he may escape in it from the castigatioa
of honest men. He says that The Call
threatened him with tne libelous publi
cation of the words of a Catholic priest.
That priest is one who has earned a po
sition of respect In this community. The
words he said were in righteous indigna
tion of the Mayor's duplicity. They wera
not published because The Call did not
then wish to introduce a religious bit
terness into a political campaign. They
are published now to prove to the Mayor
that they were not. libelous. He dare not
attempt to prove them otherwise.
And thus he stands, his character
smeared by dishonorable actions, his pub
lic life exposed as a cheap and dangerous
sham, masking a selfish ambition and a
criminal conspiracy to make those that
have elevated him to office the victims of
his future. He has sold away the peopled
rights. He has delivered them bound to
blackmailing schemers. He has set on
foot the machinery of bribery, corruption
and official crime. Will the Police Com
mlssloifFrs of San Francisco consummate
the conspiracy that will drag them down
to the low level of dishonor In which th*
Mayor reposes?
MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN has convicted him
self over his own signature of the crime of which
The Call accuses him. He has revealed himself
as a political trickster, playing fast and loose with the
scoundrels that have infested local politics and have made
our institutions a shame and a menace. The Call accuses
him of a crime that cuts deeper than his convenient official
ism. This charge attacks him as a man and a citizen; it re
flects upon and stains his personal honor, yet he dare not
enter a court of justice to defend his good name.
He dare not deny that as a cunning political huckster
he bartered away a great institution as the price for votes.
He pleads that he has the vindication of votes to sustain
him. He perhaps remembers that a Durrant pleaded once
a previous goofl character to save his neck, but the plead
ing was in vain. That Mayor Phelan was- not caught be
fore in criminal political manipulation is no sufficient rea
son why he should not be held up now to public scorn as a
man who sacrificed his decency and manhood to satisfy an
ambition by dishonorable means. The Call again charges
him with the commission of a felony that may injure the
people of the whole city, and defies him to come from the
nest of his pals to defend his good name.

Before election Mayor Phelan made a criminal contract to deliver control of the Police
Department to A. M. Lawrence. After election the Mayor sought to evade the payment of
the price that had been exacted In his dishonorable bargain. Lawrence had several confer
ences with him and came to the conclusion that the Mayor Intended to give him the "double
cross." He then sought Garret W. McEnerney, and with him went to the Mayor to demand
that which his Honor had criminally promised and what he sought as a trickster to with
hold. At that conference McEnerney used the quoted words and Mayor Phelan kept hia ante
? election, felonious bond.
Bartlett Spring?, when the Mayor, Esola
and A. M. Lawrenceâ a precious trium
virateâsought the health resort. At a
conference, to which, another was ad
mitted, the scheme was perfected to make
the sleepy guard with an alias Chief of
Police of San Francisco. The public
know the men and these men know the
fourth conspirator, who seven months
ago told of the conspiracy that now
threatens some of tho most sacred inter
ests of this city with disaster.
That was the origin of the plot. Mayor
Phelan, in his letter to the Examiner, has
related some of the other incidents which
happened in the office of the Examiner.
He has suppressed others that are inter
esting. The election^ was held and Law
rence demanded the satisfaction of his
bond. Phelan squirmed and Lawrence
threatened and stormed. -The Mayor had
sold his manhood and he had not reached
the: stage where he thought that the
price was sufficient. Lawrence sought
counsel. He consulted with Garret W.
McEnerney, who is now defending Esola
against tho accusations of indignant
citizens.
"I believe that Phelan intends to give
me - the 'double cross,' " declared Law
rence to McEnerney. "I don't believe that
he will keep his promise to force the elec
tion of Esola."
"You leave him to me," was McEner
ney's reply. "Give me your proxy and
I'll make him yield." And together they
PHELAN DISHONORED HIS OWN PROMISES AND PANDERED TO HIS VOTE
GETTING DESIRES BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN.
"1 consider that Mayor Phelan has broken his faith with me and my people. He pledged
himself upon his honor not only to lend his interest, but to give his best endeavors to the further
ance of the St. Mary's Park project. That St. Mary's got to-day the $125,000 is due solely to
the fact that the Supervisors kept their faith zvith the churches and tlie good citizens who have
fought for the removal of this plague spot. Mayor Phelan, in my opinion, has pandered to his
vote-getting desires, and let me say that I do not think that his profits will be as large as he antici
pates." â Excerpt from an interview with Rev. Fatjier Otis at the conclusion of a meeting
of the Board of Supervisors on September 18, 1899. Mayor Phelan considers this inter
view libelousi He knows where to seek redress.
knows, too, that the way to expose a
recreant, dishonest official is to reveal
him in the nakedness of his rascality and.
whip him through the streets though the
exhibition be an indecent exposure and a
menace to the morals of the city.
He cannot befog the single issue before
the people. He has made the Police De
partment of this city the commodity for a
corrupt political bargain. He has con
tracted to sell that department to in
fluences that will make it a dangerous
menace. He has done that to satisfy his
ambition. This is the issue and the only
issue, and he dare not refute before any
of the Superior Courts of this city that
before election he made a criminal con
tract that makes him a subject for the
Grand Jury and liable to the forfeiture of
the office upon which he has brought, con
tempt.
He admits that before election he felt
obliged in the event of his election as
Mayor to make Frederick L. Esola, alias
Frederick Harrington. Chief of Police.
About this there can be no controversy;
It is his own shameless confession. The
bond was given, the transaction was un
derstood, but the Mayor has not taken the
public altogether Into his confidence. He
has not told the public where and when
the compact was made and what stress
of mind and base humiliation accom
panied its progress and its consumma
tion.
The plot, the success of which will de
liver San Francisco to its thieves, was
hatched over a year and a half ago at
went to Mayor Phelan and demanded that
he appoint the men who had been chosen
for Police Commissionershlps. The Mayor

Enerney shouted. "We have stuffed you.
Now give us our verdict."
And the verdict was given. It was the
Police Commission of San Francisco and
Frederick Lawrence Esola. alias Harring
ton. Chief of Police. And the Mayor dare
not deny it in a way that will make the
denial worth the utterance. He can find
space in the columns of the newspaper of
his fellow conspirators, but why not? As
a purchased official he would be worthless
if exposed.
The Commissioners whom he has en
trapped would rebel against him and re
pudiate the pledge that makes them the
petty automatons used to work out a
dishonest deal. The public would be
warned against him and on their guard
against his pernicious, blighting influence
in other fields of municipal power. And
he has been at work in other directions,
buying, selling, promising. Fraternizing
with political scum, associating in fellow
ship with blacklegs, selling the cherished
Institutions of this city to endow new San
Francisco with shame and clothe himself
in the garb of a satisfied ambition.

city and has sold the Fire. Department to
two different cliques of politicians. He
wanted votes, and blinded to every obli

cared not what they cost to the people of
San Francisco. When the vote of the pri-
is such that all honest citizens who cher

And Mayor Phelan cannot evade the
rod of castigatlon by leaping upon the
backs of the very men who are to profit
by his degradation as a public officer. He
cannot plead a hitherto unsullied reputa
tion as an excuse for gross malfeasance
now. Instead of defending his name be
fore a court of Justice he has fled to the
arms of the man with whom he made his
criminal deal and from that embrace of
security exclaims that he has received
hiÂ» vindication at the polls. What sort
cf a vindication does he think he would
receive if he went to the polls to-morrow?
What s-tand would be taken by the people
who know now. but did not know in No

blacklegs? What indorsement would the
honorable Mayor bave received had the
people known in November that he had
been to a newspaper office and had bar
tered away the Police Department to the
criminals of the city; that he had sold it
to those that thrive by crime; that he
had betrayed the homes of San Fran

"What vindication would have been given
to him had citizens known that he had
sold the Fire Department to two sets of
political manipulators and only by
threats could be forced to be true to

It is not what he has received, but what
he would receive in the light of the start

from his face and revealed him the per
petrator of outrages that make his name
a by-word among honest men. Does he
think to deceive by referring to the ballot
box? That contains too many of his pur
chased votes and the people of this city
will not pay the price of his dishonor. His
Place for the vindication of his character
is in the courts. The method is the insti
tution of a suit. Is he sunk so low that
he cannot be slandered? Is he proof
against the shafts of contempt that he
cannot be stung?
Or docs he know that the proof is worse
than the charge and the poor consolation
of silence Is ueitcr than none? He says
that the -way to expose a newspaper Is
to show it In Its nakedness. And he
learn of the friendly attitude of the Mayor toward him, but impressed upon me that he did not seek the position, and would not exert himself in any manner to obtain it. I endeavored
to show him the necessity for an honest Board of Commissioners, what reforms would be inaugurated by a reorganized department, and that the duties of his office would be congenial.
Upon leaving him he said if the office were tendered to him he might accept, provided the other members of the commission, or a majority of them, were equally independent and res
olute in their purpose to do right as he. . . .'Â¦'â¢_ ';. .

Mr. Phelan was seen by me about a week later and acquainted with the above interview. Be offered no objection to my statements. He said he looked upon Mr. Spreckels as
the. head of the Republican party in this State, and he would naturally consult him and confer with him regarding the appointments the charter required him to make from the Re
publican ranks. His final words were "Tell Mr. Spreckels he will have to rely upon me to do what is right."
I left him with the impression that, if matters remained unchanged, when the time came the appointment would be made, or Mr. Spreckels conferred with as to Republican
appointees. . :.â¢ V
In the early part of December I sent Mr. Phelan a note reminding him of our conversations, but received an evasive reply. I have not seen .nor heard from him. since.

ness of candidates, not deferring to its judgment, but
seeking information. * * * In the Examiner on such
occasions I discussed with the proprietor, the managing
editor, the city editor and others the corruption in the po
lice Department and the best means of circumventing it.
F. L. Esola.. a young lieutenant of police, was present on
several of these occasions. He was and is a friend of the
proprietor and managing editor of the paper.
Prior to the election of 1898 his friends desired him to
run for Sheriff, and it was then that I first heard his name
mentioned in connection with the office of Chief of Police;
it was said that if he were elected Sheriff he could intro
duce himself to the public and qualify himself as Chief of
Police.
At no time, however, was I asked to procure his pro
motion, but lam not unaware of the fact that his friends
expected for him some recognition in the line of promotion
in case I was elected to office. â Extract from the Mayor's re

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 17, 1900.
To the Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: Although a supporter of Mr. Phelan in" his last campaign,
still, in justice to Mr. John D. Spr eckels, I wish to submit this statement, presuming I am the personal
friend referred to in Mr. Phelan' s letter printed in this morning's Examiner.
On the day the California Regiment arrived from Manila I dined with Mr. Phelan, and, as his
friend, as well as a friend of Mr. Spreckels, expressed a desire to bring about a harmony of feeling be
tween them, as well as a unity of purpose in municipal affairs. I had previously ascertained from Mr.
Spreckels that he bore no ill will toward Mr. Phelan; that he regarded him as a capable and energetic
official. H' :â¢
Mr. Phelan expressed sentiments of esteem for Mr. Spreckels, saying he had been somewhat an
noyed at the lampooning of The Call in the last campaign, but he had been successful and bore no resent
ment. I explained, then, that the proposition I had to offer -was entirely of my own volition; that in
making it I wanted neither money, patronage, office or preferment of any kind, and that Mr. Spreckels
knew nothing of my purpose, and might repudiate my action when made known to him. I represented
that both Mr. Spreckels and himself were actuated by a common desire for a better city government, rea
sonable taxation and honest administration' of the city's affairs and finances, as well as the prosecution of
the many badly needed improvements looking to the cleaning and beautifying of the city. Both were men
of large means and affairs, vitally interested in the prosp2rity of the city, and I knew of no reason why
they should not pull together for the welfare of the community. I stated that Mr. Spreckels and I had had
many talks bearing on the inadequacy ft .the Police Department; that I knew he was interested in its re
habilitation, and as the Mayor was obliged to appoint two Republicans on the commission, I knew of no
better man for one of the positions than Mr. Spreckels, and trusted he could see his way clear to tender an
appointment to him. I contended that Mr. Spreckels was bold, aggressive and fearless, independent, and
not to be influenced, intimidated. or cajoled into doing anything he did not believe to be right. Mr. Phelan
understood that I did not expect nor desire him to promise he would make the appointment, as that
would be in violation of the spirit of the new charter. He said he could not and would not make promises
of any kind â that he wished to state from the platform from which he was to speak during the campaign
that he was unpledged, untrammeled and without patronage obligations of any nature.
On the other hand, I made it equally clear to him that Mr. Spreckels was not requesting an ap
pointment nor expressing a desire for it.
When we parted it was mutually understood that I was to ask Mr. Spreckels if he would . favor
ably consider an appointment on the Police Commission if it were offered to him. A few days later I
unfolded to Mr. Spreckels my idea and the result of my conversation with the Mayor. He was pleased to

Ulted before the people cf San Fran
cisco. He is dishonored before the
men who pave hira their suffrages
and he is disgraced before those
from whom he asked the respect and the
esteem due to an honorable man. James
D. Phelan is revealed by authority of his
own statements as a political trickster
who did not hesitate to bargain away the
Police Department of this city to black
mailing schemers that they might use a
irreat institution as a vehicle for the pro
tection and eorrmission of crime. Mayor
Phelan has sought the protecting wing of
his pals and from its shadow he shouts
an admission, shameless and audacious,
that before election he knew that he was
expected to promote Frederick L. Esola
and that the promotion meant the high
honor of Chief of Police.
Mayor Phelan, with a mend>dty that
seems almost incredible, acknowledges
that before election he conferred with a
sleepy ex-guard of San Quentln, who
possesses no qualification except an alias
and the record of his dismissal. Mayor
Phelan declares that with this man he
Fought counsel and advice as to the
means best designed to reform the local
Department of Police.
The confession is astounding. It re
veals to what depth of degradation the
chief executive of this city has gone. It
uncovers the dirty pool of politics in
which he has waded. It shows the
mire of broke- promises, criminal
pledpes, dishonest compacts and political
dishonor with which he is plastered. The
Call has accused Mayor Phelan of of
fenses that an honorable man would re
sent. This paper has charged him with a
crime that would stir.g a decent man, yet
the Mayor does not deny the accusations
nor seek the redress that the poorest
citizen mro' claim.
It is idle for him to cloud the issue by
crying partisanship. The only partisan
ship that enters into this ffrave matter is
that which will not tolerate the barter
and sale of institutions, the corruption of
civic bodies, the prostitution of public de
partments, to the criminal uses of a dis
honest Mayor. If this be partisanship it

maries bad been taken he found that Sam
Rainey controlled between sixty and
eightly votes in the convention. Those
votes represented a formidable opposition
in the convention and a powerful Influ
ence in the districts. Mayor Phelan wished
to kill the first and command the second.
He planned therefore to do both. But
the manipulators of the Fire Department
would not deal with him. They knew him
If the public did not. They knew his
treachery, his broken promises and un
kept pledges. They had dealt with him
when that mask of the reformer had been
lifted and the face of the politician
grinned beneath. And these crafty man
ipulators would have no more to do with
Lawrence than they would with Phelan.
So again the aervlces of Garret WÂ« Mc-
Enerney were In requisition. He was
called because he was the attorney of the
department and could be trusted.
It seemed an outrage to make of the
distinguished lawyer a messenger boy to
travel from the Mayor to the manipula
tors of the Fire Department, but that is
what somebody cruelly called him. and
he bottled his wrath with the thought
that he was the mediator in great inter
ests. To Garret W. McEnerney, Mayor
Phelan promised to keep his greedy hands
off the Fire Department in exchange for
the support of the department. And that
support was given. The chattels of the
Fire Department became the chattels of
the Mayor to do with as he pleased. Ha
voted them at his whim and on election
day they won for him what he never
could win before â their own districts.
And there was peace and contentment
in the department, and then came the
crash. The Mayor refused to remain
bought. He drove a usurer's bargain
with the men who had been members of
his conspiracy and had been party to hla
criminal deal. He dismissed George Max
well as secretary of the department, and
the storm burst. McEnerney was In a
rage. He demanded to know the mean-
Ing of the Mayor's perfidy.

blandly, "there was no mention of the
name of Maxwell."
