a second attack on the kop was useless;
that the Boer right was too strong to bÂ«

withdraw. Accordingly General Warren's
division was moved back over Trlcbard.i

before. The retirement occupied fifty
hours and General Buller takes pains to
point out that it was effected without tho

LONDON, Jan. 29.â General Buller'i
dispatch stating that he had with
drawn his forces to the south bank
of the Tugela and accounts of the
fighting at Spion Kop on Wednes
day, which reached here through Boer
sources, show the British reverse in all
Its serious aspect. Ladysmlth's relief is
as far removed now as when General Bul
ler first started to General White's assist
ance, and it may yet be necessary for the
garrison, abandoning sick and wounded, to
make a last sortie and try to fight Its way
through the Boer cordons.
General Buller has signally failed In his
attempt to turn the Boers' position, and
with the force at his command cannot
hope to outflank them in another direc
tion, as the mobility of the Boers enables
them to change front at any moment. If,
then, the only chance is a frontal attack,
he is no better off than he was at Co
lenso. Should he decide on a total aban
donment of the Potgieters Drift move
ment, it would be a confession that the
relief of Ladysmith is impossible. This Is
one of the many points which is left ob
scure in General Buller's dispatch.
It is now known that Spion Kop was, as
first reported, the key to the Boer posi
tion. When the British attacked on the
night of Tuesday they secured one kop,
but- in the morning discovered two others
commanding tue one which they held.
These positions the Boers reinforced and
then began an attack and counter-attack,
the British trying to capture the other
kops and the Boers defending them, while
at the same time trying to retake the one
which they had lost. What had a great
effect on the result was the fact that the
hill on the British side was very steep and
difficult of approach, whereas on the Boer
side it sloped gently. This hampered the
British In reinforcing the detachment
which had seized it.
The British appear at once to have In
trenched themselves strongly and fighting
of a moot desperate description continued
all of .Wednesday. The battle seems to
have oscillated along: the northern slope,
now the . British and now the Boers at
tacking.

west to the southeast across the plateau from Acton Homes, through Spion Kop to the left bank
of the Tugela. The actual position held was perfectly tenable, but did not lend itself to an ad

fought with great gallantry. I would especially mention the conduct of the Second Cameron
Indians and the Third King's Rifles, who supported the attack on the mountain from the steepest

BULLER'S EXPLANATION
REGARDED AS WEAK
LONDON. Jan. 2Sâ During the morr.lng

p!a.rard tearing the words "no news"
i.ur.g: on the iron railing in front of the
War OfflCBÂ« and the shivering sentries who
f-tor><! rJard on PalJ Mall In the rain and
tleet had the district ail to themselves.
About 3 p. m., however, the placard was
taken In. and en '.he bulletin boards In-
Flfi'S General Bullcr's long dispatch was
tiipplayod.
The Btinday papers issued extras, hnt
nr.ly the faintest interest was manifested
in the streets. At the service clubs the
p!tuat!on a* revealed by General Buller
Â»Â£s considered very unpleasant. His ex
rv.fi-s. <>r explanations, were character -
izert as very weak. The absence of wa'er,
which S!r Charles Warren was "led to be
lieve" existed, and the facts that Spicn
Kop wrs "indeed a mountain" and that
Its "pe rlraeter was too large" are all mat
ters which even General Buller's warm
est admirers hold should have been us
certalred before he cttacked.
One comforting feature of the situation,
however, is the fact that General Buller's
retirement across the Tugela River was
accomplished without loss, which puts an
to the unpleasant rumors that were
In circulation here and on the continent.
The splendid gallantry of the men In cap
turing Spion Kop is rea.i with great pride
and satisfaction. It is taken as an as
surance cf the ultimate success of British
arms.
The War Office does not give any Idea
of the ( asua!t!es In taking and holding
Bpioa Kop, but a report from the Brer
headquarter* near Ladysmith. via Lou
r^r.zo Marquez, s that IKK) British dead
wrre left on the battlefield. This number
1* thought to inciude the wounded. The
report also stated that General Buller had
I ><â¢*:-. down with fever, but had recovered.
If the Boer reports are to be accepted,
"the abandonment of Spion Kop was due
to the inability of the British to resist
the Boer attacks, the Boers carrying the
first trenches and taking 150 prisoners."
MINNEAPOLIS SENDS
CHEER TO THE BOERS
MINNEAPOLIS. Jan. 28.â A pro-Boer
mars-meeting of citizens was held at the
exposition this afternoon, which was at
tended by about 4000 people, despite the
fact that the thermometer stood below
zero. Krank Larabee. a Minneapolis law
yer, presided and addresses were deliv
ered by Governor John Lind. Mayor
James Gray, Rev. J. M. Cleary. pastor
of St. Charles Church, and Judge Wil
liam Prentice of Chicago.
The most significant feature of the oc
eas=Son was the absence of Republicans.
During the past week forty-two promi
nent citizens of that political faith were
invited to act as chairmen, but declined.
This, however, was not from lack of sym
pathy with the cause of the Boers, but
rather the fear that the meeting would
develop pronounced anti-expansion senti
ments. These fears, however, as it prov
ed, were groundless, only in two or three
instances references being made to the
administration's policy in the Philippines.
Resolutions were adopted exprorsing
hearty sympathy with the Boers of South
Africa, denouncing the efforts of Great
Britain to annihilate their republic and
to crush the spirit of freedom, commend
ing the mar.ner in which Com Paul and
his people have conducted the war, con
demning the British for using demdum
bullets and lyddite shells, protesting
egainst the seizure of American flour and
beseeching the President of the United
States to act as mediator between the
Boers and the British, to the end that
the var may. be speedily terminated.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 2S.â The Fourteenth-
Btrtet Theater was packed with enthu
siastic sympathizers of the Boers' cause
this afternoon. Dr. Emll Pretorious. ed
itor of the Westliehe Post, acted as chair
man snd opened the meetir.sr with a brief
and interesting speech. A<Mre?ses were
made, by ex-Governor W. J. Stone, Judpos
Rombau and Estef, J. W. Taylor and
Hon. O'Neill Ryan. Resolutions strong
end sympathetic were adopted. After de
claring In Caror of freedom as defined
by the Immortal ar.d illustrious Abraham
Lincoln they ca.ll upon the President cf
the United States to use his good of
fices to bring about a quick ending of the
t-trupgle now on between the republic and
Oread Britain and if later events tend
to forecast the ultimate victory of Gr-at
Britain to step in and "d^rr.and" that

graphing Thureday, January 25, says:
"Over thirty Frenchmen who arrived
here by the French steamer Glrondo and
were prohibited from proceeding tp the
Transvaal, appealed to the French Con
sul, who protested that they had pass
ports by the Transvaal Consul and who
declared he would hold the Portuguese
Government liable In damages for a
breach In international law in the event
of continued refusal to allow them to go
forward. As the Portuguese Governor
General had previously signed the pass
ports he was compelled to admit the va
lidity of the French Consul's contention
The result was that the Frenchmen were
allowed to proceed; Eighty more foreign

next week."

STORY OF THE BRITISH
ASCENT OF SPION KOP
LONDON, Jan. 29.-The Dally News
publishes a dispatch dated Spearmans
Camp. Wednesday afternoon, but held
hack, prerumably by the censor, until Fri
day, January 26, 6:40 p. m. The corre
spondent says:
"Having gallantly taken a portion of
Tebanyama Mountain during last night.
General Warren's troops are finding con
siderable difficulty in holding It. There has
been heavy fighting to-day. The Boer
shells are eplendidly directed, and In the
face of the enemy's heavy fire the further
advance of our forces has been checked.
"Again and apain attempts had been
made to dislodge the enemy, and things
had begnn to look serious. Determined
as had been their attacks, however, the
Boers had not succeeded In dislodging
them. Meanwhile the King's Royal Rifles,
approaching from the Potgleters Drift Ride
of the mountain range, began the arduous
ascent of Spion Kop. The heights at the
place where they advanced were precipit
ous and their task was no light one. They
advanced, however, and i apparently at 1
first without the knowledge of the Boers,
but before reaching the top they became
exposed to a flank fire from the enemy.
"The last part of the hill was even more
precipitous than the road along which
they had come, but the brave fellows
scrambled up little by little, sometimes on
stream. Dawson miners have great hopes
of reaching their mecca first, and to ac
complish this are even prepared to leave
the steamers below Nulato and make a
portage of 200 miles across the Tundra.

from 300 to 1000 passengers, are now ach-d

all steamers sailing this early will be com
pelled to wait at Dutch Harbor two or
three weeks tor the Ice to move out of

REMARKABLE RISE OF
STANDARD OIL DIVIDENDS
Have Varied Between 6 1-4 Per Cent
in 1882 and 33 Per Cent Per
Annum in 1897.
Special Dispatch to The Call. ~iY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2S.â Standard Oil
Company dividends have varied between
5^4. per cent per annum In 18S2 and 33 per
cent In 1897. This was brought out In a
statement made by S. C. T. Dodd, solicitor
of the Standard Oil Company, In reply to
inquiries prepared by Professor Jenks,
trust expert of the Industrial Commission.
Dodd says the quarterly dividends of the
company aggregated 614 per cent in ISS2;
6 per cent in 1883 and 1884; 10% per cent in
18S5; 10 per cent in 18S6 and 1&S7; UVs per
ce/it In 188S; ]2 per cent In 18S9, IS9O and
1891; 12.21 per cent in 1892; 12 per cent in
1&93 and ISM; 17 per cent in 1895; 31 per cent
in ISD6; 33 per cent In 1597, and 30 per cent
in ISDS, and that a stock dividend of 20 per
cent was made In May, ISB7.
In reply to a general question as to the
work of organization and its effects Dodd
reviews the history of the Standard com
bination and summarizes the results ac
complished by cheapening transportation
by pipe lines and tank cars, by purchas
ing terminal facilities, acquiring steamers
and other vessels, and by employing in
foreign countries the same special meth
ods of storing and transporting oil in
bulk, by which the markets of Europe
are held for American oil against Russian
competition.
Dodd says the manufacture of oil has
been much cheapened and improved by
uniting capital, skill and acts and pro
cesses and patents of several persons, by
building up Improved manufactories on
a more extensive and perfect scale In
centers of trade, and by Improved busi
ness methods generally.
CAPTAIN MURDERED
AND SHIP SCUTTLED
Mutiny Aboard the Briguntine Ethel,
Which Results in Seven Deaths
and Arrest of Mutineers.
VICTORIA. B. C, Jan. 28.â Mall advices
received here tell of a wholesale tragedy
on the New Zealand brigantlne Ethel In
the Straits Settlement. She sailed from
Broome, Western Australia, about the
end of November with a cargo of lumber,
and has been posted as massing. A tele
gram was received by the Governor of the
Straits Settlement from the British Con
sul at Batavia to the effect that the ves
sel had been scuttled by part of her crew,
who had mutinied and murdered the cap
tain and owner, John Alfred Riddle, to
gether wun his eon, the mate, the carpen
ter and three of the crew.
The mutineers, who numbered thir
teen, after they had landed at Adult, had
a quarrel among themselves, as a result
of which, when they reached Maccassar,
one of them Informed the Dutch authori
ties, who, arrested the mutineers and
seized the valuables and other property
they had stolen.
News has also reached here of the cap
ture of five officers of a Dutch mail
steamer who Imprudently went ' ashore
and were attacked by the savages of New
Guinea. A relief party next day found
ashes of bonfires and traces which led
them to believe that all five had been
killed and eaten by the savages. The New
Guinea authorities have sent for a war
ship.

that even now the Government has any
adequate comprehension of the situation.
The utterances of responsible Ministers
have done nothing to reassure the country
on this point.
"Heavy or light, the thing has to be
done, and the Government ought to pro
pare for the immediate dispatch of 50,000
men and take steps to send yet another
50,000 if these should be needed. The hope
less atempts to carry on the campaign
with four widely separated columns, each
unequal to its task, must be abandoned
for a concentration of force and of pur
pose."
All the editorials this morning breathe
the spirit of calm determination. Not one
will allow that any reverse could deter
the country from the object It has set
itself to attain, whatever the sacrifice
which may bo involved.
Very frank criticism of the Government,
however, is beginning to be heard, even
in quarters that have hitherto refrained.
The Dally Mail boldly throws all the
blame upon Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
Lord Lansdowne and Lord Wolseley. It
points to President Lincoln's dismissal of
Simon Cameron from the post of Secre
tary of War as a precedent for "getting
rid of incompetent Ministers."
The Morning Post dwells upon the dan
ger of further rebellion at the Cape and
of possible European complications. It
urges that the navy be prepared for
"any emergency." ,
The Standard and other papers reflect
the anxiety of the public to learn how
much truth there is in the Boer accounts
of the fighting at Spion Kop. General
Buller's obscurity in his dispatch Israther
bitterly criticized, as well as the evident
.fact that the censor Is not only heavily
delaying, but is striking all Important
matters from the newspaper dispatches.
To Judge with any accuracy of the ex
tent of the disaster is virtually impos
sible.
It appears Uiat General Buller had al
together five brigades wholly or partly
engagedâ General Cooke's, General Hlld
yard's. General Hart's, General Wood
gate's and General Lyttelton's â and the
270 casualties already announced in Lyt
telton's brigade are thus explained. Much
mystery still surrounds the retreat. It is
possible that General Buller has with
drawn his whole forces, but it is generally
assumed that Lyttelton's" brigade and
Lord Dundonald's cavalry and "other
troops are still on the north side of the
Tugela.
General Buller's confidence that the
Boers did not molest his retreat because
they had been taught to respect the fight
ing powers of the British soldier is not
shared in London. It is thought, rather,
that the Boers had some other plan in
6tore or did not wish to waste their men.
Large arrivals of troops are due at Cape,
Town during the week. Thero has been
great activity in military quarters In all
parts of England since Saturday morning.
The War Otlice. anticipating a great crush
at the opening of Parliament, has placed
new restrictions upon . visitors during the
session.
The situation at other points is un
changed, but Indications that Lord
Roberts Is preparing plans for an advance
across the Orange River come in a dis
patch to .the Daily Chronicle from Sterk
stroom, dated January 25, which says
that Thibets, an important position near
Steelberg, on the Stormberg-Rosemead
line, is now occupied by the British, who
are repairing the railway and bridges.
The correspondent observes that this
will facilitate communication between
General Gatacra and General Kelly-
Kenny.
LONDON, Jan. Â£9.â London received
the bad news of Buller's defeat
early. Club members who had
frk-nds in the War Office brought
the news first. It gave a shock,
such as has not been felt since the
commencement of the war. Specials,
loudly cried, began to come out, and then
the Dally Telegraph boards started telling
the tale.
The truth was out. General Buller had
been forced to retire to his old position
south of in? Tugela. It Is quite impossi
ble in words to convey the Impression
tnaiie. Military men who usually talk
with the tones of those who have com
manded battalions spoke of the news and
made comments in subdued voices.
The impression, let me tell you, has been
simply awful, awful. Since the com
mencement of the war there has been no
such scene in the War Office. You sim
ply could not get in at the doors. Lines
of cabs stood outside and there were black
masses of surging, anxious people. They
all tried to pass inside at .once and, once
inside, having got to the boards, they
found a long telegram which told the
tale that General Buller had had to re
tire; that weeks of hard work, of fight
ing, of loss of life and prestige had merely
resulted In, to use the general's own
words, "in spite of our cumbersome trans
ports, we retired without loss, which
shows the respect held for British arms."
Naturally, opinions by the thousands
are forthcoming, but while the impres
sion made here is beyond measure pain
ful, no opinions that I have heard are
other than for a further continuation of
the campaign. That reflects most abso
lutely the British sentiment to-day.
Parliament meets on Tuesday. There
will be ail kinds of questions asked, per
tinent, and perhaps impertinent, but the
events of to-day fortify the position of the
Ministry. That Ministry will say, "This
is not the moment at which we can an
swer any questions as to details. Either
you have or you don't have confidence in
us. Take a vote and the Government will
have an overwhelming majority."
What is more striking is that not a
voice Is heard against Buller or his gen
erals. Open talk is heard of the absolute
necessity of abandoning Ladysmith to its
fate, while Lord Roberts returns to the
original plan of an advance over the
Orange River upon Bloemfonteln.
To Ladysmith the disappointment must
be very bitter. A dispatch from the Boer
laager near the town, dated January 24,
describes the garrison as "very evidently
preparing a desperate coup In order to
effect a junction with General Buller's
advancing army." It may be regarded as
a certanlty that, In the confident hope of
early relief. Sir George White has lately
tten Issuing" eiTtra rations, end this fact
has given rise to an exaggerated idea as
to the length of time the provisions would
last. Even should it be decided to send
General Buller reinforcements and to at
tempt to reach Ladysmith by a movement
through the still more difficult country
east of Colenso, it is extremely doubtful
whether the garrison could hold out long
enough, as such a movement would oc
cupy at least a month.
The Times says: "The most carefully
planned and executed movement of the
whole campaign has entirely failed, and it
can hardly be necessary to dwell upon
the extreme probability that we shall
learn, a little sooner or a little later, of
a catastrophe almost without precedent
in our military history, a catastrophe, in
deed, without a parallel except in the sur
render at Yorktown.
"We are checked at every point of the
campaign. In fact, the campaign is still
to begin. We wish we had clearer proofs
Special Dispatch to The Call,
i SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 28.â The tide of modern ideas has swept away almost
every ghost that once flourished in this State, but up to yesterday there
was one that managed to keep his head above the flood of progress and cast

what it }s, an exceptionally fine cat, its owner hopes it may flourish to a green
old age.
Kappemann's cat is one of the best-known felines in the county. It Is a
cat with a character of its own, and among its most favored haunts is the
County Jail: Some years since, when it was Just emerging from ki.ttenhood
into a rat-catching maturity, it became the pet of a Chinese prisoner, who
had noticed the animal's frequent expeditions to the prison in search of the
large rats with which It abounds. The Chinaman was found one morning
dead by his own hand, drowned in a large tank of water which stands at one
end of the corridor.
Two months later a hobo spending a night in the county's free lodging
house was scared nearly to death by the apparition of a shapeles3 shadow
which glided along the wall and disapperaed, apparently, into the tank with
hideous clanking of chains and blood-curdling screams. The same sepulchral
experience being undergone by many other prisoners, the community began to
think there was "something in it," and even the most skeptical shunned the
thought of a night In the haunted corridor. A week ago Antone Jason, a boy
of 15, sentenced to sixty days, was found by the Jailer half dead with fright
and declaring he had seen a spirit. The boy, so Bincere did he seem in his
fear, was removed to another cell.
Then an investigation was made by two newspaper men, and the watchers
were rewarded by the sight of the shadow and all sound of all the other
ghostly properties. When the shadow dived Into the ta.nk one of the Investi
gators ran round behind it and sure enough it was Kappemann's cat. The
gas jets in the corridor are so placed that any object moving on the op
posite wall W the one on which the shadow was seen is magnified to gigantic
proportions and assumes a fantastic aspect, which to a credulous mind cer
tainly looks uncommonly like' a ghost. When the feline dived behind the
tank the shadow appeared to enter the water, and a large chain which is
connected with the side of the tank for some forgotten purpose accounts for
the spectral clanking. . A cat's voice when on the hunt is ghostly enough for
any spook. And so the last lingering spirit has been swept from San Ra
fael, and citizens can no more point with pride to the Jail and tell the
summer visitor blood-curdling tales of the dead Chinaman's ghostly esca
pades. The cat which is responsible for the spiritual manifestations Is one of
the "lions" of the place, and only two weeks ago saved the life of Miss Ber
tha Kappemann by attracting her attention to a fire which had Ignited her
dress and threatened to envelop her In flames while she slept.
NATIONALISTS ROUTED
IN FRENCH ELECTIONS
Of Their Thirty Candidates in the City
of Paris Only Three Are Chosen
for the Senate.
PARIS, Jan. 28.â The election of ninety
nine Senators yesterday resulted In a
practical rout for the Nationalists, only
three out of thirty of their city candi
dates being elected.
The Nationalists made a great show of
military men, Including Generals Mercier,
Lambert, Prex. Reblllot, Prothar, Cler
soet and Laveuve and Colonels Ravant
and Montell. Admiral Gallibert was also
a Nationalist candidate. Of these Gener
als iuercier and Lambert alone succeed
ed, boia commanding large majorities.
General Mercier was the principal Nation
alist candidate.
The defeat of their whole list. Includ
ing Generals Prex and Laveuve, In the
department of Sarthe, is tantamount to
a rebuff to M. Cavaignae, Minister of
War, who had backed the list. M. Ca
vaignae Immediately resigned the presi
dency of the general council of the de
partment, which had opposed his nomi
nees.
On the first balloting the elections were
decisive in eighty-seven cases, the results
being divided as follow: Republicans 64,
Liberal Republicans 6, Radicals 15, Social
ists 6, Nationalists 3, Monarchists 4.
In twelve cases second balloting? were
necessary. The final result modified ths
figures of the first balloting, so that the
Senacors elected yesterday show '.he fol
lowing party divisions: Republicans â¢>!,
Liberal Republicans 6, Radicals 18, Social
ists 7, Monarchists 4, Nationalises 3. The
general result leaves the composition of
the Senate virtually unchanged.
The Figaro cays: "We have gained noth
ing and lost nothing. If to-morrow a Min
istry came before the Senaw tending
toward either unintelligent reaction or
Socialist adventure the S-nate would re
peat It-, treatment of the Ministry of M
Bourgeois end would force a resiiriation."
The National press Is elated at the suc
cess of General Mercier and the defeat of
the Dreyfusard publicist. M. Ranc The
Dreyfusard organs express their regret at
the tatter's rejection, because he took a
leading part throughout the Dreyfusard
campaign.
There was a Bcene of excitement outrfde
the Hotel de Ville when M Ranc'a defeat
and General Mercier*s election were an
nounced, almost simultaneously, the news
being greeted with cries and counter-cries
of 'vlve Mercier, vive la republlque"
and 'Conspuez Ranc," but there were no
disorders. j
Among those elected arÂ« M. de Freyd
net. Baron Tie Courcel and M. Duiwy.

SHACKLES WON
HIM FREEDOM
Criminal Escapes From
His Guard.
Special Dlepatob to Tbe Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 28.â Andrew Ma
son, who was recently con\icted In Sun
Francisco of petty larceny, second of
fense, and who was sentenced to five
years' Imprisonment in Folsom, to-night
escaped from Deputy Sheriff Whelan,
who was taking him to the penitentiary.
After alighting from the train Mason, who
is said to be one of the most desperate
criminals in the country, begged the dep
uty sheriff to relieve him of the handcuffs,
claiming that they were hurting him.
Whelan examined the handcuffs, and find
ing that they were not doing any Injury
to Mason's wrists started with him to the
County Jail.
While walking along I street Mason
tripped up Whelan, and as he was about
to fall to the sidewalk the desperate man
struck him on the head with the hand
cuffs, rendering him insensible. Mason
then ran down I street and entering a
house occupied by Japanese ordered one
of the occupants to get a hammer and
break the handcuffs which stil adorned
his wrists. The Japanese, realizing that
Mason was an escaped criminal, tied in
terror, and meeting a policeman hurriedly
informed him of what had happened. The
officer lost no time in reaching the scene,
and with Whelan, who had just recovered
from the effects of the blow delivered by
Mason, started in pursuit of the fleeing
criminal. They visited a number of houses
in the vicinity, but were unable to get a
trace of him. ;â¢
According to a citizen who witnessed
the assault on the deputy sheriff, Mason,
after rendering his keeper hors de com
bat, attempted to unfasten the handcuffs
by striking them against a lamp post.
After leaving the house tenanted by the
Japanese he ran down I street and disap
peared along -Front street.
As soon as his escape was reported to
Chief Sullivan he detailed several of hia
best men to round him up. At 1 o'clock
this morning they had not succeeded in
getting a clew to his whereabouts. Mason
is well knawn to the police of San Fran
cisco as a desperate crook. He has al
ready served one term in San Quentin.
and frequently boasted that If caught
again in the act of taking other people's
property he would resort to murder rather
than spend another term within the walls
of a penitentiary. *.

RESPONSE TO THE

that they had not voted for him when he

Burnett to persevere In the course he had

LEGISLATORS ARE
OFF TO THE FRONT
Political "Warriors Depart for the
Scene of Senatorial Con
flict.
There was an exodus yesterday after
noon of the political contingent that has
gathered in this city ever since the news
of the extra session was first published.
Tho men with sacks, the men who fol
low the men with sacks and the men
who follow the men who follow the men
with sacks all struck the trail for the
Mecca of senatorial ambitions â Sacra
mento. .
All the old-timers were on hand when
the 6:30 boat started across the bay, and
besides the well-known faces of the men
of many fights in the past were seen the
features of others more or less new in
the business, and to whom the proceed
ings of the next thirty days at the capi
tol will be a liberal education of the fine
art of Western politics.
The boat was crammed to the edges
with politicians, artists, scribes. Sena
tors. Assemblymen and the motley rlf
raff that the promise of "somethin* do
in' " always attracts to the scene Trf op
erations. Luckily no accident happened
on the way across the bay. If anything
had occurred there was material enough
in that one load to provide dissension
in hades for the rest . of eternity.
Among the representative men who
carry with them the wishes of the best
part of the community were seen Sen
ators Cutter, Smith and Flint, Assem-

the former adherents of the southern can

or authorization. They are simply carry
ing out the plan laid down by Burns tc
keep Grant and every other candidate he
can coax into the fight in the field until
the legislators get tired of the balloting
and come over to him In a bunch. Despite
the protestations of his supporters that
he would retire gracefully as soon as he
found he could not win. It is known that
the Mexican has come into the fight again
to stay and that he proposes to pursue
his same old tacticsâ delay and intimi
dation to prolong the game until his op
ponents may be worn out. This particu
lar end of his campaign he has turned
over to Kelley, the "sad-eyed," and his
cohorts, and still claiming the authoriza
tion of Grant the gang has got well to
work. Assisted by Jake Steppacher they
have been working for the past three days
upon Assemblyman Crowder, one of
Grant's closest friend 3 and adherents.
Every inducement has been held out to
him to come over and bring his follow
ing with him, but the doughty representa
tive from the southland has turned the
whole game clown and is standing with
the forces in opposition. He will caucus
with them to-morrow.
CANDIDATES FOR SENATOR
EARLY ON BATTLEGROUND
All Have Established Headquarters
at the Golden Eagle
Hotel.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 2S.â All of the men who
have ambitions to represent the State in
the United States Senate have established
their headquarters at the Golden Eagle.
Colonel Dan Burns has a suite of three
rooms, and all of his lieutenants are there
making their boldest front. His quarters
are rooms 8, 9 and 10. Among those who
hover around the place and extend the
"glad hand" are Hervey and Al Lindley
Ed Conroy M. R Higgins, manager of
the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany; Guy Barham, Jake Steppacher nnd
Walter Parker.
Irving M Scott was also early on the
field of battle, and intimated to his friends
that he was here to make the fight of his
life. Senator Davis Is taking a hand in
his campaign, and he is being assisted
by Assemblyman Dunlap, Milton Green
and Jim Brown of the Grant camp. Their
headquarters are at rooms 5, 4 and 5

Herrln's satellites are whispering of a
mysterious compact made in the East
which will place U. S. Grant by the favor
of Huntington into a comfortable posi
tion. It is intimated that the San Diegan
statesman will also be reimbursed for the
expenses of the last Senatorial campaign.
Hints are thrown out that Grant's sup
porters will show their appreciation by
lending their support to the Mexican. The
story is ahsnrd on its face. Grant is not
seeking the favor of Huntingdon or asking
reimbursements. His supporters know
that he will never give countenance to
such a bargain as the touts describe. At
the proper time he will advise his follow
ers that he is not in the field as a candi
date. His prolonged silence, however,
complicates the situation and to pome de
gree embarrasses the friends who gave
him loyal support.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â T0-morrow's pro
gramme Is the reorganization of both
houses of the Legislature and the redis
tribution of the patronage. Also these
are the things against which Dan Burns
and his same old crew have to-night made
their chiefest fight. It is the plan of the
Mexican to begin the balloting for Sen
ator on Tuesday of the present week. He
wants as little time as possible allowed
his opposition to arrange their forces and
prove the falsity of the claims he has
been making to a substantial increase in
his voting strength. The anti-Burns
forces have lined up solidly against him
and propose to carry the reorganization
scheme through to-morrow after caucuses
of both houses. They have come up here
to the capital well stocked with law and
legal precedents and are prepared to
prove that the scheme proposed by the
Mexican would invalidate all subsequent
proceedings. It is also probable that
those who are opposed to the Alcalde and
his aspirations will hold an informal cau
cus on the main proposition some time
during the afternoon. Grant's adherents
got together to-night and discussed the
general political proposition, but did not
decide upon any set plan oi procedure.
They all stand ready, however, to go

PHELAN, IN DESPERATION,
SEEKS COMPLIMENTARY VOTE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2S.â ln the bustle and
confusion which are attending the manipulations of Republican politicians to
night most observers have lost sight of what promises to be one of the most
amusing and perhaps dramatic incidents of the extra session.
James D. Phelan. Mayor of San Francisco, is working every political com
bination he ever made to receive from the Democratic members of the Leg
islature the complimentary vote for Vnlted States Senator. The honor may or
may not be an empty one, but the chief magistrate of San Francisco is begging
for it with more vehement pleading than he ever used in asking for political
honors from the people of the metropolis.
It Is perhaps strange that Democratic politics have interjected themselves
so aggressively Into a situation so distinctively Republican, but the fact re
mains that almost as much Interest attaches to-night to Phelan's effort as
ding's to the rival aspirations of Senatorial claimants in the Republican camp.
The Mayor of San Francisco has a aouble motive in seeking the indorsement
of tho Democratic members of the Legislature. Within the last three weeks
he has destroyed a political future which years of success promised.
Within his own political organization he has alienated every powerful in
fluence. He has violated nearly every promise he made before election to
men of standing within his party. He has Ignored the politicians who ac
complished his election, organized his campaign and labored for his success.
In the distribution of the Democratic patronage of the metropolis Mayor
Phelan has showered his favors upon the drones and left the workers to
the poor consolation of drifting in the outer darkness.
In consequence there is a determined and powerful revolt against the
Mayor of San Francisco within his own party. The men who manipulate
primaries, control conventions and dictate pledges that mean the success or
fail -re to Senatorial candidates are determined that James D. Phelan shall
r.ot receive the prize for which he has been seeking and which at some turn
of political fortunes he expects to win. A complimentary vote for United
States Senator means now. therefore, a great deal. Phelan realizes that he
is absolutely discredited within his own party. Democratic leaders insist
that his outrageous disregard of party obligations has not only destroyed all
hope of success in San Francisco at the next election but has jeopardized the
Democracy In the next State campaign.
The Mayor of San Francisco realizes all of his and that is why he Is rep
resented here to-night by a powerful lobby working laboriously in his behalf
for the complimentary vote of the Democratic, members of the Legislature.
But there is a still deeper and more important reason why the chief execu
tive of San Francisco wants this vote, which under ordinary conditions would
mean an empty honor. There is not the slightest doubt that the political
future of Mayor Phelan of San Francisco in the State depends upon his vic
ory or defeat in the contest In which he has entered. Within the last three
weeks Mayor Phelan has seen his political standing before the people of Cali
fornia cliange as if by magic from one of the best to one of the 'worst.
The startling expose in connection with the Police Department of San
Francisco, which revealed him as a cunning, unscrupulous political trickster,
thoughtful of his own selfish Interests and of nothing else, has created a
revulsion }f feeling throughout the State. Newspapers Independent of party
politics are denouncing the Mayor of San Francisco as a greedy politician,
who only worked his discreditable schemes the better because h?. owned a
mask of respectability and wealth. Three weeks ago. Phelan was esteemed
i man of honor â now he is a political huckster who will barter any public
right, however sacred, to advance his own ambition.
Mayor Phelan is not blind to the seriousness of his situation, and this Is
another reason why the complimentary vote of the Democrats at this session
possesses a deep significance in the politics of California. The faithful in the
Democratic organization, those who have met the coldness of rebuke and the
sting of unkent promises, are determined that Mayor Phelan shall not receive
the complimentary vote of the Democratic members of the Legislature. These
rebellious leaders of the flock have decided that the treachery and political
dishonor of the Mayor of the metropolis shall receive the stamp and seal of
repudiation, and that his name shall be presented only to be scoffed at and
spurned under the feet of indignant Democrats.
To one who does not care the spectacle is amusing; to Mayor Phelan it
means the turning balance that will thrust him into oblivion or leave him
as a factor in Democratic politics. The bitterness of Democratic factions is
proverbial, and the present fight violates no tradition. The opponents of
Phelan have thrown into the field as his opponent a man In whose political
history there is no taint of heresy, who has followed party principles and
party commands wherever they led.
This man is Major P. J. Harney, State Harbor Commissioner, and the wise
ones are saying to-night that when the complimentary vote of the Demo
crats is registered the name of Phelan will sound hollow as a mocking voice
In the. Legislative chsvmbers. The Mayor of San Francisco will probably dis
cover that unkept pledges sometimes are expensive and that the prostitution
of public institutions does not always mean the reward of a Senatorial toga.
CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the Ftomnch has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or bloat-
Ir.g sensation after eating, accompanied
F.ometlraes with sour or watery risings, a
formation or gases, causing pressure on
the heart and lungs and difficult breath-
ing, headaches, fickle appetite, nervous-
ness and a greneral played out, languid
feeling.
There Is often a foul taste In the mouth,
coated tongue, and If the interior of the
stomach could be seen it would show a
Ellmy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and obsti-
r.ate trouble Is found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment and
Irritate the delicate mucous surfaces of
the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy digestion Is the one necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion
Is secured the catarrhal condition will
have disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson. the safest
and best treatment Is .to use after each
meaJ a tablet, composed of Diastase,
Aseptic Pepsin, a little NoxJ Golden Seal
and fruit acids. These tablets can now
b^ found at all drug stores under
thÂ«Â« name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and not being a patent medicine can be
r.sd- with perfect safety anÂ«l assurance
that healthy appetite and thorough di-
gesTlcn will follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn street.
Chicago. 111., writes: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold

i he had not authorized the statement that
j he would vote for Burns, but admitted
that he woula rather have Burns than no
Senator.
In the break away from the Burns camp
George Knight. Irving M. Scott and Gen-
eral Barnes will derive strength.
The Call, desirous of obtaining news and
I having no candidate for Senator, has
j elicited many expressions of preference,
and it may surprise some of the knowing
j politicians to ascertain that George A.
i Knight is acceptable to many Republi-
j can members of the Legislature. For ex-
| ample. Senator Luchslnger and Speaker
i Anderson of Solano County, who cham-
pioned the cause of General Barnes at the :
last session, and who are still loyal to
their gifted leader, have no hesitation in
j asserting that Knight would be accepta-
ble to them.
Irving M. Scott has been assured of cer-
tain strength from the Burns column
when the break from the Mexican comes,
but his candidacy does not inspire enthu-
siasm. The attitude of the Solano delev
gation may be ascribed to local feeling at
Vallejo on the subject of ship building.
I Many of Barnes" supporters maintain
that Mr. Scott did not render to the gen-
eral in the last contest such support as
the attainments of the orator Justified.
Whatever may be the cause, the Barnes I
men are not enthusiastic for Scott. '
When it is perfectly obvious to disinter- I
ested spectators that Burns Is not as I
strong as he was one year ago, the touts j
exclaim: "It was fixed, or Gage would
not have called the extra session. Do you
mink the Governor, knowing that Burns'
election was doubtful, would have called I
a special session?"
Tne question so freely and frequently
asked by the touts can be readily an-
swered, and the logical answer is this:
Burns had only one chance left, and that
was the remote chance of winning In ex-
tra session.
He knew that he could not carry a dis-
trict In the State when the people had
the opportunity to vote on the question of
his candidacy. Therefore the proposition
to go before the next Legislature was dis-
missed at once. He knew that appoint-
ment by executive favor would not give
him the right to sit in the Senate beyond
the meeting of the next Legislature even
if the Senate admitted him on his cre-
dentials from the Governor's office.
This was the dilemma presented to the
Mexican. He had no chanca whatever
other than that which the extra session
offered. He accepted It as the gambler's
last desperate throw, and he will lose

BURNETT COMMENDED FOR
HIS DESERTION OF BURNS
The Senator Becsives the Earnest
Congratulations of Many Con
stituents.
The desertion of D. M. Burns' cause by
Senator Frank W. Burnett has excited
the universal commendation of his friends
and acquaintances, all of whom say that
the Senator has acted in a manly way by
withdrawing his allegiance to one who is
manifestly unworthy of the high office to
which he has the presumption to aspire.
All day yesterday from early morn until
Senator Burnett took his departure for
the capital in the evening congratulatory
messages were received by him at his
residence, 4H Valencia street, where he
has maintained a lucrative photographic
business during the past fifteen years.
Several of the messages were brought by
messenger boys, while a number of resi
dents in the district represened by Mr.
Burnett called in person to testify their
approbation of his action in leaving the
unworthy Burns standard before it had
contaminated him by association.
Among the callers at the Burnett domi-
I had only been taken after ' mature con
sideration and an earnest desire on hla
part to conform to the wishes of his con
stituents, who were almost a unit in their
opposition to Burns.
The publication in yesterday's Call of
Burnett's decision to renounce allegiance
to Burns created a small sized sensation
in the Mission district, part of which Bur
nett represents in the State Stnate. All
day little knots of men were gathered on
the street" corners discussing the incident,
and in the main words of praise were
freely uttered. One enthusiastic friend of
Burnett was loud in his approval of tha
latter's determination to pull away from
an alliance which would only engulf him
in political oblivion at no distant day.
"Burnett Is too honest a man to be tied
up with such a man as Burns," he said.
"Now that he has renounced him he has
earned the respect of all decent citizens.
In leaving the Burns contingent he has
but manifested his Independence of spirit
which stamps him as a man of good sensÂ©
and probity."
BURNS DENOUNCED
FROM THE PULPIT
In a pr*;ude to his regular sermon last
evening Rev. TV. E. Dugan. pastor of tha
Stewart Memorial Presbyterian Church,
paid his respects to Dan Burns, the can
didate for Senatorial honors. In part ha
said:
I am not personally acquainted with Candi
date Dan Hums, but !f we ran believe reports
he U notoriously unfit for the o'flce to which
he aspires. It is certain that If Burr.a was
all rieht that the preps would not dare to de
nounce him as it does. There la something
very radically wrong with the man and he is
no more fit to represent our paocle than an
Imp of perdition is fit to represent celestial
glory.
We do not Trar.t a r*presentat!vÂ» who has
the whole-hearted support of the racetrack
element and has the support of the worst
classes. If we expect God's blessing to rest
upon our nation we will neÂ» ( V tr> see to It that
we put decent men in our United States Senate.
I think It was said In the House when Roberta
was expelled that manly men were wante*!.
Should we. .in the face of this, foist upon our
Senate a man of notoriously bad principles?

A "DEGRADATION" CLUB.
OF all the forms of folly to which the spirit of
perversity has prompted erratic men and
women in these days, the maddest and the
worst is that outlined in a recent report that the
death of a girl in Ohio has been traced to a "Degra
dation Club," in which a member drawing a certain
lot bound herself to leave home and live as degraded
a life as she could.
That such a thing could happen in any part of the
United States is inexplicable to human reason, but
the Baltimore American undertakes something in the
way of explanation by saying the incident "shows
that there is undeniably a morbid taint in the up-to
date atmosphere which is doing incalculable harm in
the perversion of minds, especially young ones. It
is not altogether impossible that it is due partly, if
not wholly, to the present much exploited idea of
showing up vice in all its hideousness on the stage
and in literature, in order to increase the charms of
virtue by contrast"
That theory is ingenious, but it will not satisfy the
common sense of men. If the Degradation Club had
been the outcome of conditions that prevai. in the
crowded cities of Europe it might be attributed to
some such cause as that the American suggests, the ef
fect produced upon a degenerate intellect by morbid
imaginations. But who can believe there is any de
generation of that kind among the people of the
United States?
It is not at all likely that either the stage, the yel
low press, the literature of the time, or all of them
combined, are responsible for so mad a craze as that.
The thing is one of the freaks^of vice that appear to
result from a direct inspiration of the devil and
neither the world nor the flesh should be accused of
complicity in it It ia a case of eccentricirv gone
stark, staring mad, and it cannot be accounted for
any more than the butcheries of "J ac^ the Ripper."

ANOTHER LEASE BILL.
WE have already commented upon the virtues
and infirmities of the Foster bill, to provide
for leasing grazing lands west of the ninety
ninth meridian. Its infirmity is the provision for ex
change of lands and lackof protection for the actual
owners of stock against syndicates and speculators in
leases. Its virtues are in putting the whole adminis
tration of the law in the hands of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Secretary, of the Interior, and this
administrative part is admirably provided for and well
safeguarded.
There is another bill, introduced into the House by
Mr. Mondell of Wyoming, which consists principally
of infirmities. It provides that the Federal Govern
ment shall abdicate its control of the public domain
and create therein a State trusteeship for the purpose
of selecting, delimiting and determining the grazing
lands and leasing them in tracts not exceeding 3200
acres to any one individual or company. The whole
process is to be in the hands of the States where the
land is located. We regret to have to say of Mr.
Mondell's bill that it is pernicious in the extreme,
and will result in producing exactly what it ostenta
tiously pretends to prevent. Under the pretense of
preventing monopoly of these leaseholders, by fixing
the maximum at five Eections, it contains no prohibi
tion of assignment of the leases. One sees at a glance
the fell purpose of the bill. No grazing business can
be carried on on 3200 acres of land. If the ranges
were fresh and unexhausted the average that they
would carry is one steer to forty acres, or sixteen
cattle to the section, and on the five-section limit of
the Mondell bill the number would be eighty cattle!
No herdsman would pretend to live on that number
of cattle, and if the bill prohibited assignment of the
leases it would effectually destroy the grazing busi
ness.
But the purpose of the bill is to lease the lands in
these impossible tracts, too small for use, and, by not
prohibiting, permit the assignment of these leases,
so that a syndicate owning no stock at all, but repre
senting the meat-packers, could take the leases on
assignment and crowd the cattle-owners to the wall.
The Mondell bill should be killed, and under
such circumstances as to deter any one from pre
senting its counterpart.
Wyoming has been intriguing for years to get the
public domain turned over to the States, and now
seeks the nearest possible approach to that policy by
creating a State trusteeship in the grazing lands.
It is a grievous thing that a policy so necessary
as the preservation of the grazing lands by division
into leaseholds should at once invite the grabber and
the speculator into the field to control legislation for
their benefit. The beef food supply of this country is
at stake as well as an important and increasing part
of our export trade. When the ranges are exhausted
of their natural forage the range stock, which is the
great source of supply, will disappear. It Is an eco
nomic and commercial emergency which must be
promptly met by Federal legislation that retains Fed
eral control of the whole subject. The. lands should
be accurately examined and leased in varying tracts,
according to their varying capacity for carrying stock.
The leases should run for ten or twenty years and

DECLINE IN WINTER TRADE
I AST week attention was called to the irregu
larity in trade as exhibited by the bank dear
ings. It was shown that whereas all prominent
cities made a regular weekly gain in 1899, the same
uniformity no longer exists, and that some of the
larger cities are now showing a loss. This new
condition was emphasized last week, the clearings of
the country falling 24.8 per cent behind those for the
same week in 1899, while of the eleven principal
cities all exhibited a loss except Pittsburg, San Fran
cisco, Gncinnati, Kansas City and New Orleans.
The largest five cities fell behind.
These figures show a decrease in the volume .of
business, which is variously explained by commer
cial theorists. The general opinion is that the mild
winter in the East has diminished the inquiry for
seasonal goods. A few think that the accumulation
of orders in 1899, running far into 1900, act as a dam
against new business. Perhaps this latter view may
be correct, but the former has the most supporters.
It is undeniable that the warm weather has greatly
reduced the call for winter necessaries, and dealers all
over the country are complaining of large stocks still
on hand, with spring not far off. Another effect of
the mild winter is shown in the lumber cut, which bids
fair to fail short of the average, owing to the lack of
tnow. The New England cotton mills, too, are com
plaining that deficiency in water is keeping back their
deliveries. Boots and shoes are in less demand and
hides and leather are quoted quieter and weaker in
consequence. From these reports it would seem that
the mildness of the winter is alone responsible for the
falling oft in trade. The iron trade is less active, as
uncertainty as to the maintenance of the present high
prices tends to check new orders. But e\'en if the
demand for iron and steel should show a serious
falling off, there are old orders enough on the market
to keep the works running for six months, so no stag
nation in this important industry is feared at the
moment. Coal, however, is easier, the warm weather
having lessened the consumption.
Certain !:ncs, however, continue active, notably dry
goods, which are meeting with a good spring inquiry.
Winter clothing is duil, but spring garments are en
joying a brisk trade. Cotton goods are selling well
in almost all markets. Thus it will be seen that what
ever decrease in business exists is almost exclusively
in winter goods and that there are no signs of any
diminution in the spring and summer trade.
The feeling in Wall street continues to reflect the
varying aspects of the South African war. On the
day after the capture of Spion Kop by General War
ren the money markets everywhere were easier,
stocks and consols were strong and the Bank of Eng
land promptly reduced its rate of discount from 41-2
to 4 per cent. On the following day depression en
sued upon the news of the British abandonment of the
kop. and so it goes, day after day. He who is a good
enough guesser to forecast the day's results on the Tu
gela may turn a fortune in Wall street. It is the wand of
Oom Paul that sways the money and stock markets of
the world to-day. In last week's selling of stocks,
however, it was the foreigners, not the Americans,
who sold. Bonds have met with increased favor dur
ing the past week and the gilt-edged, high-priced
issues, yielding low rates, have been neglected for the
less reliable but larger interest-paying classes.
Where these are not obtainable the public are taking
dividen d-paying stocks. The dividend Beems to be
the attractive bait just now, which indicates invest
ment rather than speculative buying by the public
The industrial situation in California has cleared
during the past three weeks. A fortnight of dry
weather has enabled the farmers to resume opera
tions and much plowing, sowing, planting and prun
ing have been done. With a higher and wanner sun
in February and rot too much rain the crops will be
planted in good shape, with fine prospects for an
immense yield. There are no signs now to indicate
that 1900 will be less prosperous than 1899, which was
i great year.

A NATIONAL NEED.
1 ; ROM the convention of the National Board of
j Trade, in session at Washington, comes one of
* the strongest memorials in support of the mer
chant marine bill which has yet been submitted to
Congress. The memorial is the more important be
cause it emanates from a body which is not only non
partisan, but is representative of the commercial in
terests of every section of the Union. No similar
body of men is better entitled to speak on this sub
ject, or is more worthy an attentive hearing.
The memorial sets forth that in 1826 vessels of th-
United States carried 02 per cent of the nation's im
ports and exports, while in 1899 they carried but S
per cent. That the extraordinary decline in the rela
tive proportions of our foreign shipping is not due
to any lack of energy on the part of our ship
builders or merchants is made evident by the fact that
the tonnage of vessels in the coasting trade, in which
foreign competition is forbidden, increased from
722,330 tons in 1826 to ; 3,965,313 tons in 1895. It is
evident, therefore, that the failure to maintain our
shipping in the foreign trade has been due solely to
the lack of an adequate system of protection.
After pointing out that the people of the United
States are now paying to foreign ship-owners nearly
$200,000,000 annually to do our ocean carrying trade,
the memorial goes on to say: "The enormous decline
in our ocean merchant marine is due to the lower
wages paid abroad and to the subsidies paid by foreign
Governments, Great Britain alone, according to
Document No. 470, Miscellaneous Series, issued by
the British Government, paying last year $3,266,380 in
'posta.l subsidies' and $233,005 additional to the same
steamship lines in 'naval subventions/ while for wages
alone the cost of operating an American ship is al
most exactly one and a half times the cost of operat
ing a similar British ship, and the difference in wages
gives gfeatly increased advantages to foreigners in
every way, including lower cost in the construction of
By saving to the United States the money paid out
for the service of foreign ship-owners many benefits
would be derived in addition to that of upbuilding our
merchant marine. It would afford a means of giving
employment to thousands of American workingmen
in shipyards or in the merchant service; it would
train officers, engineers, machinists and seamen for
an auxiliary force to the navy in time of need; it
would stimulate our commerce and provide a better
means for the export of the products of our forests,
farms, mines and factories, and thus tend to the more
profitable employment of men in those industries.
For all of these reasons it is certainly desirable that
the protective principle should be extended to ship
building as well as to other American industries.
That is the conclusion of the memorialists, and it is
to be noted they do not stop with a vague affirmation
of the subject, but give indorsement expressly to ship
ping bills now before Congress.
It can hardly be possible there will be longer delay
in dealing with a subject of such pressing importance
as this. The prospect is the Nicaragua canal bill will
be passed at this session of Congress, and a liberal
shipping bill should accompany it, for it will, be of
little profit to us to construct the canal and leave to
other nations the ships that are to pass through it.
As a matter of fact the upbuilding of our merchant
marine is now of pressing urgency, and the sentiment
of the people is overwhelmingly in its favor.
THE SESSION EXTRAORDINARY
WITH the assembly of the Legislate to-day
the representative* of the Republican party in
that body join the issue with the Southern
Pacific Railroad upon a question of momentous im
portanceânone other than that of determining
whether the political affairs of California are to be
directed by the will of the people or by the Kentucky
corporation.
It is indeed a session extraordinary. It has been
called by the Governor for the purpose of giving the
Southern Pacific Railroad another chance to elect to
the United States Senate the man whom the Repub
licans rejected at the regular session. It has been esti
mated that the session can be conducted at a cost not
exceeding $1500 a day, but it may exceed $2000 a day.
Certainly if the railroad managers have their way they
will place upon the payrolls in one position or an
other a host of greedy taxeaters, carried to the State
capital to shout for the railroad candidate. Even if
the estimate of $1500 a day be not exceeded the cost
will be great if the session be prolonged. That cost
is to be saddled upon the taxpayers of California for
no other object than that of giving Herrin another
chance to elect Burns to the Senate to satisfy the de
mands of Huntington. Truly in politics as in busi
ness the Kentucky corporation is imposing upon
California every dollar the traffic will bear.
No Republican in the Legislature can be ignorant
of the sentiment of his constituents and of the whole
State on the issue. It is a sentiment of disgust at
the trickery and fraud practiced by the conspirators
in arranging their programme and of indignation
that such a echeme should be attempted to disgrace
Republicanism and to dishonor California. That
sentiment was not lightly formed, nor will it quickly
pass. It will hold the Republicans in the Legisla
ture to a strict responsibility and pronounce judg
ment upon them in the elections of the coming fall.
When Governor Gage was a candidate for office
he deceived the public, which had no means of esti
mating the full* extent of his duplicity. The circum
stances of the time tended to confirm confidence in
his words. The funding bill has been passed and
the long controversy over that subject has been defi
nitely settled. The railroad managers one and all
vowed they had no further political schemes to ad
vance. Gage over and over again asserted, affirmed,
declared and swore he had no affiliations with the
railroad, would never be in any way a party to rail
road encroachments upon public rights or servile to
j railroad bosses.
On that showing he was elected. Now the people
; perceive him coming forth as "worker" for the rail
! road's disreputable candidate for the Senate; .they
see him sneaking secretly into San Francisco and
: holding conferences with the railroad bosses, Herrin
I and Wright, for the purpose of arranging with them
i the means by which Burns or some one of his stripe is
! to be elected to the Senate, and from these facts they
! learn something of the extent of his dishonesty, both
I in words and in action.
The Republican party has been betrayed by the
man whom it elected to the office of Governor and
the taxpayers look to the representatives of Repub
licanism in the Legislature to resent the betrayal.
I That is the extraordinary issue of this session. That
I is the one feature of it which holds public attention.
i By his vote for Senator will every Republican le'gis
| lator be judged and there will be a day of bitter
! reckoning for those who prove recreant to honor and
; to duty.
be made absolutely- non-transferable. The law
should provide the co-operation of the Department of
Agriculture with the leaseholder in restoring the
natural forage of the rangeâ first, by understocking;
second, by reseeding the land with gramma, bunch or
buffalo grass and qther annuals which once grew
upon it.
It is somewhat painful to reflect that the people of
California were diverted from their purpose to help
themselves in the matter of storing storm waters to
this policy of leasing the grazing lands and devoting
the proceeds to such storage, only to find the first at
tempts at legislation apparently in the interest of syn
dicates and speculators, and ignoring entirely the wel
fare of the ranges and the actual stock-owners. Is it
possible that the evidences of organization and money
that were apparent in the subtle and sinister influence
that wrenched the Vater storage convention from its
purpose originated with the few monopolists who by
such a bill as Mondell's desire to feed fat at the
expense of the honest stock-owners and the Govern
ment?
Whatever the facts may be, the duty of the Waters
and Forests Society is plain. It should at once and
powerfully promote proper and well-guarded legisla
tion that will result in a proper leasehold policy that
will at once measure the help to water storage that
may be expected from that source, to the end of se
curing not only the benefit to follow preservation and
restoration of the ranges, but a full exploitation of the
policy of defending the revenues of the leases for irri
gation.
IN the present agitation and discussion
of water front matters the wonder Is
that so much is said and written by
persons who should be better informed.
The general charge that the port
charges of San Francisco are excessive,
and greatly exceed the charges of the
great seaports of the world, is simply un
founded and untrue. By reason of the
great destructiveness of marine pests, this
port has been one of the most expensive
to keep in repair of any of the harbors
of the world. This is now being overcome
by building recently designed structures
that are comparatively marine-pest proof.
After the construction of more permanent
structures, expenses for repairs will be
less, tolls may be abolished and port
charges reduced, but in no place in the
United States is there such a thing as a
free port.
For keeping in repair the wharves and
their approaches, there is used, monthly,
between two and three hundred thousand
feet of lumber. Will some gentleman tell
us how this can be had without cost? This
corn-mission, since its organization a few
months ago, notwithstanding constantly
Increasing Business, have reduced the pay
roll $2600 per month, $31,200 per a^ 11 " 1 ";
have increased the rents of ferry slips $s&0
per month. $10,5C0 per annum, making a
yearly gain of $41,760 from these two
items, and have advised the Chamber or
Commerce as follows:

In your investigations this Commission will
afford your committee every facility, and will
meet and confer with It as often as may be
desired.
As the investigation progresses any sugges

for the improvement and betterment of th.s
service will receive careful consideration.
Radical changes have been recently made.
The Commission stands ready to make such
other changes or reforms as circumstances may
warrant and sound business methods Justify.
Very respectfully- WM. D. ENGLISH.
Secretary Board State Harbor Commissioners.
The report of the committee from the
Chamber of Commerce (referred to in the
above communication;, after an examina
tion of water front matters, says:
"That owing to the urgent need of
funds, not only to maintain the efficiency
of the present structures but to provide
means to extend the seawall and for
builldlng new wharves, we do not suggest
any reduction in the charges now made
for wharfage and tolls.'
This committee was comprised moetly
of shipowners and seafaring men. The re
sults of their deliberations should be ac
cepted as sound and conclusive.
In a communication recently received
by the writer of this article, in reply to
the following question, "What is the max
imum charge on a 2000-ton general mer
chandise ship discharging at the port of
New York?" the secretary bf the Depart
ment of Docks and Ferries of the city of
New York answers as follows:
"In reply to your communication, I beg
to state that the maximum charge on a
2000-ton general merchandise ship dis
charging at the port of New York is $13
for every twenty-four hours. The cost
while loading a similar vessel is at the
same rate: vessels whether discharging,
loading, lying idle or being repaired, are
charged at the same rate. There is no
charge made for merchandise passing !
over the wharves, either inward or out- :
v.-ard; but all merchandise left on the
wharf or pier twenty-four hours after dis
charging is subject to a charge of sc per
ton.
The charges for a similar vessel at San I
Francisco are $17 50 per day while dis- j
charging, one-half of this amount, or $S 75
per day, while loading, arid one-quarter,
or $4 40 per day, while lying at the wharf
repairing. In addition to the foregoing
there is*a toll charge of 5 cents per ton
for merchandise passing over the
wharves. [No tolls are charged on grain,
flour or miilstuffs. our principal articles
of export.] To offset the toll charge of
this port I quote from a high authority on
dues and charges on shipping in foreign
ports, as follows: .-.t* "
'â¢Forty days in New York is only equal
to ten days at San Francisco. A ship at
San Francisco has half the width of the
dock and her entire length, and can and
does discharge in ten or twelve days as
much cargo as she can in New York in
forty days."
This is conclusive that the port charges
of the port of New York and the port
charges of San Francisco can vary but
As to the port charges In foreign ports,
I quote from the most exhaustive and
comprehensive report on docks and ter
minal facilities that has ever been pub
lished, as follows: fs"<A
"Referring to Liverpool, in addition to
the tonnage charges on vesseis there are
dock rates and town dues on goods, the
enumeration of which occupies thirty
rages, on which rates are levieo. per pack
age, per hundredweight and per ton,
ranging from three and one-half pence
per ton on coal to five shillings per lon
on various high cost manufactured arti
cles with differential rates on certain
bulky goods In transit from foreign ports,
and those arriving coastwise and after
ward exported and a few others.
"The foregoing is a sample of the tolls
and charges customarily levied in foreign
ports subject to local variations in
amounts. Aside from these at some ports
other charges, such as anchorage, light
house and harbor dues, are levied, all of
which appear not only complicated but
burdensome as compared with the few
simple charges this side of the Atlantic."
Since the organization of the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners there has
been expended in seawall construction
$2 645 C7l 06. The construction of the ferry
hulldinK over and above the $600,000 in
bonds, exceeded $400,000. The modern
wharf in San Francisco is equal to the
best on the Atlantic seaboard. The ferry
building, second to , none in the United
States built for the same purpose, not
fully appreciated by our own people, is
spoken of In the most complimentary
terms by tourists and travelers. The re
cent notable visiting architects were en
thusiastic in its praise, and of which the
world's greatest architect, Mr. Benard,
fiavs- "I Â»ke the ferry building; it ia
symmetrical and very fine." This build
ing was constructed over the heads of a
million people per -month passing to and
So and not the slightest accident oc
curred, nor were the public inconvenienced
by so much as the detention of a ferry
boat On the completion and occupancy
of this magnificent structure, a credit to
any State in the Union, not one of the
leading Journals of this great city has
been gracious enough to say, "Well done."
If gentlemen so profuse in their abuse
of the State administration would take
a walk on the line separating the State's
control from that of the city they will
find an object lesson that may be to them
a revelation. Only a short time since the
Harbor Commission had to defend Itself
against a suit brought by a man who had
fallen Into one of the numerous manholes
that disgrace the Btreets of the city bor
dering on the water front.
In the administration of any public trust
Just criticism should not be feared but
Rlways Invited. In a recent denunciation
of water front matters a gentleman is
reported to have Bald: "To handle the
State's water front In San Francisco we
have had hayseeda and politicians." If
the gentleman is correctly reported his
gratuitous insult to the producers of this
State was uncalled for and in bad taste.
I would most courteously remind my
young friend that when "hayseeds" have
been called to the front their administra
tions of public affairs compare most fa
vorably with that of those gentlemen
whose only occupation in life has been
the devising of more approved methods
for "doing' the "hayseeds" out of the
product of their honorable toll. I would
kindly remind my young friend that in
the City Hall scandals and Tweed ring
ecandals no "hayseeds" have been found.
I would further remind the gentleman
that the two officers of this board, its
secretary and one of its Commissioners,
who were formerly convicted of high
crimes In office" and sentenced to San
Quentin, were neither of them "hay
seeds." '
And then comes a clergyman, with no
respect for the dignity of his profession,
who, in a neighboring city a few months
since. Is reported to nave indulged In the
following unpardonable harangue:
"Look at some of . the pitiable thing*
about California. Not a vessel come In
yonder Golden Gate Â¦ but it is taxed for
ANOTHER VIEW OF THE
STATE HARBOR QUESTION
the sake of the politicians. Thi3 !s one
of the finest harbors on the globe and
requires the least expenditure on the part
of man to make it safe and ample, yet
the harbor rates are the highest known
among civilized peoples. And why? tor
the improvement of the harbor, for the
building, of, seawalls, for dredging and
blasting or any other improvement? >o.
Simply to maintain a horde of idle, use
less parasites. If this were all it would
be bad enough, but these men come in an
organized body of robbers." etc.
If the reverend gentleman is correctly
reported and hi 3 religious teachings are
as false and. senseless a3 his water front
tirade I greatly fear that his pastoral
flock Is In danger of perdition.
And to the gentleman who in the past
few months has accepted so many cour
tesies from the Harbor Commission I
wish to say that he also displayed pad
taste when, on the eve of the recent elec
tion, in making a grandstar.d-gallery
play for the suffrages of the people of this
city, he indulged in the following:
"The only thing of ours which the
charter does not restore is the harbor, ana
in time we hope to get that also bacK
from the State, given at a time when the
people had no confidence in the city gov
ernment. Let this port be a haven of se
curity, not a robbers' roost."
And what has occurred to so suddenly
remove that admitted lack of confidence.
How long is it since the treasury of this
city was looted under the very eyes of Its
most honorable, efficient and hefty
Mayor? "Robbers' roost," forsooth, is
not the gentleman a little previous to
overlook hi 3 own roost and throw stones
at the State administration? And, might
it not be well for him to remember his
own glass house before boasting of supe
rior wisdom and purity and propose to
make a swoop to gobble the State s prop
erty, when one of his own roost has been
in San Quentin hardly long enough to
warm his perch?
For the gentleman's Instruction and con
sideration I quote the following from the
very able report made by a commission
appointed by the Legislature of Massa
chusetts to report on docks and terminal
facilities, to prove to him that to not one
foot of the ground or water of the Bay
of San Francisco, or any of the navigable
waters of the State, has title ever been
given, nor can it ever be given to Indi
vidual, corporation or municipality:
Concerning the reasons for public ownership:
A harbor Is essentially public. The right to
embark and disembark again to the land should
be free, as free as the people whose property it
Is. â¢ â¢ â¢
In a democratic republic like the United
States the harbors are held by the State gov
ernment as a sacred public trust, which even
the Legislatures have no right permanently to
Impair.
In Martin vs. Waddell, 18 Pet. RÂ«p-. 410, the
United States Supreme Court says:
"When the Revolution took place the people
of each State became themselves sovereign,
and In that character held the absolute right
to all their navigable water* and the soil un
der them for their own common use, subject
only to the rights surrendered by the constl
tlon."
This Is not a new doctrine, but it is oeca
eionallv well to restate It, and It Is found re
affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United
States in what is known as the "LakÂ» Front"
case of Chicago, where. In delivering the opin
ion of the court, Mr. Justice Brtwer says:
"The position advanced by the railroad com
pany ia support of Its claim to the ownership
of the submerged lands and the rirht to the
erection of wharves, piers and docks at Its
pleasure, or for* its business. In the har
bor of Chicago would place every har
bor In the country at the mercy cf a
majority of the Legislature of the State
In -which the harbor is situated. â¢ â¢ â¢ But the
decisions are numerous which declare that such
property Is held by the State, by virtue of Its
sovereignty, in trust for the public. The own
ership of the navigable waters of the harbor
and the lands under them is a subject of publla
concern to the whole people of the State.
â¢ â¢ â¢ This follows necessarily from the
public character of the property, belngr held by
the whole people for purposes In which the
v.hole people are interested." â¢
Section 1. article 15, of the State consti
tution reads: v â¢
"The right of eminent domain is hereby
declared to exist to the State to all front
ages on the navigable waters of this
State."
Section 3 of the same article reads:
"All tide lands within two miles of any
incorporated city or town of this State
anil fronting on the waters of any harbor,
estuary, bay or inlet, used for the pur
poses of navigation, shall be withheld
from grant or sale to private persons,
partnerships or corporations."
An article on the failure of Municipal
Control of Public Utilities in the Literary
Digest of January 6, lf*Â», says:
â¢ â¢ â¢ One if the failures seems to be
the New Torit City Dock Dppartment. A
correspondent of the New York Sun calls
attention to the department's official re
port and the deplorable record that It re
veals, and from this correspondent's let
ter the Chicago Evening Post arsrues that
municipal control is a failure. It says:
" 'The dock department has been in ex
istence for twenty-eight year?. It was
created by a law which providpd that all
docks, wharves, piers, water fronts an.l
their appurtenances and easements then
possessed by. the municipality of New
York, or to be hereafter acquired by it,
should be under the full control of the
Commissioners, who were to execute only
temporary leases for their use. and to de
velop, improve and extend the wharfage
system for the public benefit. Much was
expected from the adoption of this plan.
The department was made independent
and given the use of the city's credit for
the issuance of bonds under certain gen
eral restrictions. The department has
made its own collections and disburse
ments. Its total revenues for the period
of its existence have amounted to $34 .CA
000, while its expenses have been $37,800.
000. not including the cost of new prop
erty acquired or any allowance for ex
penses saved through the facilities afford
ed by the city In numerous Important
ways. The total loss to the city up to
date on its ownership of the docks has
been about $18,000,000. In point of fact,
the business men of New York regard the
dock department as a wretched failure,
and at the various conventions and gath
erings of the commercial societies the
view uniformly taken is that the present
condition of the department is the inevit
able result of the principle of municipal
ownership and control.* "
With this experience in New York be
fore us, do we wish to fall Into the same
error?
Since the appointment and organization
of the Harbor Commission of the State
of California, with the exception of a few
months, the City members have been Iff
control; there is no contention, however,
that the superior qualifications of the
Mayor would not enable him to make bet
ter "appointments than could or would be
made by the Governor of the State.
Not a pound of produce reaches this
city by water, with the exception of grain,
but that pays tribute for the maintenance
of wharves and bulkheads.
The producer* of the State are builders
of this city, and to them is the city large
ly indebted for its progress and prosper
ity. Then. pray, why should they not
have a voice in the State's affairs, of so
much concern to them?
No heed need be taken of ambitious
echemers. They are found in all cities.
But the honest and sensible men of San
Francisco will never Insult and outrage
the farmers and producers â the brains,
brawn and muscle that constitute the
safety and bulwark of the Stateâ by say-
Ing to them. You do not t'^ppss th*> cour
age to do battle against ihe teredo and
limnoria that infest the State's harbor;
you have not the skill and genius neces
sary to fashion wood and stone Into the
necessary harbor improvements, and you
lack the honesty and lntpenrlty necessary
to collect, guard and disburse the reve
nues of the State's harbor, a large propor
tion being by yourselves contributed.

young Princes, Buckingham, Lord Riv
ers, Hastings, etc., all enlist our sympa
thies more or less. But when we see
"King Richard III" played our whole in
terest is centered upon the king himself.
He then becomesâ what he really isâ one
of the greatest, most marvelous most
astonishing creations in the whole Shake
spearean universe. Our interest in him
dominates and transcends our Interest in
everything else. It follows, therefore,
that King Richard is a difficult role to
play. As In the cases of King Lear, Ham
let. Shylock and Othello, only the great
est actors can do justice to it.
In one respect King Richard 111 is the
most difficult of all the Shakesperean
roles. There is not merely the charac
ter of the man himself to sustain but
the characters of all the different aliases
he assumes. We must remember that
Richard does really obtain the consent
of people to acts and courses of conduct
which, if he were not so consummate a
dissembler, they would never consent to.
If then, the part be not so well sustained
that it appears real and natural the ac
tion of the play becomes nonsensical and
ri Th?play was popular In Shakespeare's
time: As far as we can learn, the most
popular of Its day. So often and so well
was the play presented that Burbage, the
King Richard of Shakespeare's age be
came in people's conceptions almost the
real King Richard. That famous line-
A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!
Was quite as much associated In the pop
ular mind with Burbage and g 03 â¢^
Field as with King Richard and Bosworth
FltdisF It d is somewhat remarkable, however,
that subsequent to Shakespeare s time the
play as Shakespeare wrote it fell Into dis
favor. This was perhaps partly because
of its inordinate length. It was neces
sary to revise and condense it. and the
?evlspr and condenser irreverently (as we
should say) substituted his own concep
tion and treatment. It thus happened
that the play. "King Richard 111. * Wch
the world has seen most of and heard
most of is not Shakespeare's play at all.

ber, the actor, dramatist and poet laure.
can scarcely todâ¢*
â¢strong enough to condemn what the> call
fhe "deformation" which Clbber made of
Shakespeare's noble Production. Never
theless, we must remember that for about
150 yearsâ indeed, quite down to jer> re
cent timesâ Gibber's version of *he play,
or some version or other of Clbber s ver
sion, was the only "King Richard 111
th II G t wÂ°a2 d Sir n Henry ming who. on Janu
ary 29 1577. gave to the stage a King
Richard III" arranged wholly from Shakes
peare's text. Shakespeare s play was too
long to be resorted to In toto. Irving a
version is not more than a half or at
most three-fifths, of the Play as Shakes
peare left It.
Almost all great actors who have es
sayed Shakesperean parts at all have cj
â¢laved the cart of King Richard 111. It
was in the part of King Richard 111 that
Garrick made "his first appearance en
any stage" in the little theater of Good
man's Fields. The stage-infatuated young
wine merchant appeared incognito, but
the success he won, though it scandalized
his family, determined his career. His
Richard 111 soon became the wonder and
talk of the town. And King Richard ever
remained one of Garrick's greatest parts.
John Philip Kemble included Richard
111 In his magnificent reportolre of
Shakespearean characterizations. But the
part was too versatile for Kemble s state
ly talents. The great King Richard 111
of Kemble's era was that unfortunate, er
ratic jrenlus George Frederick Cooke. of
whom Byron once laid, having heard that
a biography of Cooke had been written,
that two things were marvelous about
himâ first, that a man so contlnuou.ily
drunk should live long enough to have a
bloeranhy; and. second, that a man so
much in his cups as Cooke was should
ever have known any one sober enough
to write his biography. Cooke's frequent
disappointments of the patrons who
thronged his house to hear him In his
trreat part became at last too annoying
to be endured. Once, when he had vainly
endeavored to remember his lines, he put
hla hands to his breast, and, simulating
crossing the mountain range and Thomp
son Pass, 2600 feet high, thence down the
Teithell River Valley through the
swampy pass at the head of the Knata,
thence down the Tonsina Into the Copper
River Valley. Captain Abercrombie be
lieves that the future tor a. railroad
through this section of Alaska is very
promising, owing to the presence of large
zones of heavily mineralized copper de
posits, the development of which, he says,
undoubtedly will yield a local tonnage of
great volume. He states that the prox-
Imlty of tie and bridge timber and the
absence of any great engineering features
would render railroad construction a
comparatively easy problem.
Edward Gillette, a member of the expe
dition, contributes an important chapter
to the report on the feasibility of estab
lishing a practical railroad route up the
Copper River Valley. He draws a com
parison between the route from Seattle to
Skaguay with the Valdes route to the ad
vantage of the latter.
The report says the soil Is productive,
that vegetables and hay can be raised,
that there Is plenty of timber and that
hardy farmers from Norway and Sweden
would farm as successfully in the Copper
River Valley as in their own country. The
country also contains coal of good quality
and marble of various colors.
DISPOSITION OF
CHURCH PROPERTY
Left to New Philippine
Commission.
Special IMspatch to The Call
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. Jan. 2S.â
President McKinley has determined to
leave to the new Philippine Commission
the question of disposition of church
property in the far Eastern archipelago.
The commission will consult with the
municipalities relative to the action to be
taken, as will also be done in connection
with the status of the friars who remain
in the islands. At the same time the ad
ministration will have to determine what
shall be done with the church property
in the island of Puerto Rico and the
claims of the Catholic clergy both here
and in the Philippines for the continuation
of the support they received from the Gov
ernment of Spain and which they claim js
guaranteed them by the treaty of Paris.
These questions Â¦ are very embarrassing
to the administration, especially as It is
on the eve of the Presidential campaign,
and there is no desire on the part of
officials to take any action which may be
offensive to the Catholic voters of the
country. No Instructions have been given
to either General Otis or General Davis
relative to the disposition to be made of
the property claimed by the church, and
none will be for the present at least. In
the insular budgets of the Philippines and
Puerto Rico expenditures for the support
of the Catholic clergy have been carried
for some years prior to the American
acquisition.

NOT IN HARMONY WITH
THE ADMINISTRATION
Republican Leaders Oppose the Presi
dent's Idea of Free Trade With
Porto Bico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2S.â There are
prospects of friction between the admin
istration and the Republican leaders in
the Senate over the Porto Rican tariff.
President McKlnley adheres to his recom
mendation for free trade between Porto
Rico and the United States, and the bill
introduced by Representative Payne, pro
viding for the extension of the revenue
laws over the island and its establish
ment as a customs district, has the sup
port of the administration.
Several of the most influential Repub
lican Senators, including Messrs. Platt of
Connecticut, Aldrich and Allison, are dis
posed to support Senator Foraker's plan
to impose a Email duty on goods shipped
between this country and Porto Rico.
The House Committee on Ways and
Means has not yet acted on Payne's bill,
but it is believed it will be reported as it
was introduced. This disagreement over
the Porto Rican tariff and the determi
nation of the Republicans In the Senate
to kill the reciprocity treaties show there
is a decided lack of harmony between Mc-
Klnley and some of the leaders of his
party. ,
WRECKAGE AT SEA.
Indications That the British Ship
Merrimac Has Been Lost.
LONDON, Jan. 28.â 1t has been learned
that the British steamer Mallnhead, Cap
tain McKee, which sailed from Ardrossan
for St John, N. 8.. on January 23, picked
up a piece of wood marked "Merriâ ."
The board is supposed to be a part of one
of the boats belonging to the missing Brit
ish steamer Merrimac, which sailed from
Quebec October 27 for Belfast in command
of Captain Shallis. Nothing has been
heard of her since she left Canada.
Trade With China Growing.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â A report pre
pared by Frank H. Hitchcock of the
Agricultural Department shows there has
been a great development of our trade
with China and Japan during the past dec
ade. In the fiscal year 1899 the value of
the merchandise exchanged with these
two countries, including the port of Hong
kong, reached $57,305,655, against only J46,
294,167 In 1889. Â¦ <i.-." .. .
Figures given show that In the decade
there was a gain of $28,393,156. or 256 per
cent In exports, while the increase in im
ports amounted to $21,618,365. or 36 per
cent. v

GEORGE FREDERICK COOKE AS RICHARD 111.
Kean's death scene, too. In "King Richard
III" (death scenes, it may be said, were
Kean's fortes) was a marvel of appro
priate representation.
In the estimation of personal friend*
Junlus Brutus Booth waa Kean's great
rival. Opinions differ very much as to the
quality of Booth's genius as compared
with that of Kean's In many
parts. But there la no difference
of opinion as to the merit of
Booth's Richard 111. Almost the only
adverse opinion ever pronounced upon It
was that- it was an exact Imitation of
Kean's. This was in England, however.
When In 1825 Booth came to America he
fcund himself supreme, not only In Kin?
Richard 111. but in every other tragic
part. When he died (In 1852) It seemed
for the moment as If the grandeur of the
stage had ended.
It will always be a regret to the lovers
of Edwin Forrest's name and genius that
he had not in youth the advantage of fa
miliarity with good stage examples and
noble stage ideals. Had this been so, had
he not for years been doomed to act amid
the demoralizing influences of rough, un
cultured audiences, there is little doubt
that Forrest would have ranked with the
world's greatest players â with Oarrlck,
with Mrs. Slddons, with Edmund Kean â
for his natural histrionic powers were of
the highest. As it was. his Richard 111
was a noble production, though far Infe
rior to his Lear, his Othello and hfa Co
riolanus. and especially to his Vlrginlua,
his William Tell and hi 3 Metamora.
King Richard 111 waa tho elder Booth*
most famous part, and it is an interesting
Illustration of the descent of genius that
it was In "King Richard III" that Booth's
greatest son. Edwin Booth, first ma<JÂ»
fame. The elder Booth wa3 given to
moods. One night in New York. In ISSI,
being billed for Richard lIT. he> announced
to his son, who was attending him. that
he was ill and unable to perform. Then
the son pleaded that the people would be
disappointed. "What can they do with
out you. father?" he cried. The only re
ply that he received waa: "Go act it
yourself." And this at last he did Of
course he knew the part, for every word
and tone and gesture of hlr father's act-
Ing had long before been absorbed In his
very being, so loyal and dutiful a son waa
he. But it was an anxious night for him.
His father's clothes that he had to wear
were far too big for him. and he could
plainly see that the managers of the
house were on tenterhooks. But his
genius carried him through. At the end
of the play he knew that he had found
his vocation.
ICoteâ Th<Â» study of "Kingr Richard TO"
will be concluded on Thursday. The two
concluding papers In the Shakespeare
course will be of unusual Interest. Dr.
Parrott of Princeton will present a paper
on "The Schools of Shakespearean Criti
cism," and Hamilton W. Mabie will pre
sent a paper on "How to Study Shakes
peare." _______________

DID NOT KNOW HE
WAS A TIPPECANOE
Senator Mason Replies to the State
ment That He Was Ejected
From the Club.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â Senator Mason
of Illinois in a signed statement concern
ing the published reports that he had
been requested to withdraw from the Old
Tippecanoe Club of Chicago, said to
night:
"I notice by the papers that I was ex
pelled from the Tippecanoe Republican
Club in Chicago. I never applied for mem
bership. I heard through the press that
charges against me had been preferred
by Colonel McWhorter that I did not
agree with the President on the Philip
pine and Boer questions."
The Senator then made a personal at
tach upon the integrity of Colonel Ale-
Whorter. and adds:
"This (the reference being to a personal
and not a political matter) is the only
communication as to any charges against
my Republicanism directly or indirectly I
have had with Colonel McWhorter. chair
man of the committee on political action
of the Old Tippecanoe Club of Chicago.
Had I known that I was a member of the
club and that McWhorter was chairman
of any important committee I should have
resigned. Meantime, I am for liberty and
self-government in Cuba, the Philippine
islands, South Africa and Chicago, ilc-
Whorter or no McWhorter."

RAILWAY MAY BE
BUILT IN ALASKA
Route Surveyed by Cap
tain Abercrombie.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2S.â The War De
partment has made public an important
report from Captain W. R. Abercrombie,
Becond Infantry, who commanded the
Copper River expedition In Alaska last
season. The chief topic treated in the
report is the laying out of the great
Trans-Alaskan military route from Port
Valdes. Alaska, to Port Egbert, on tho
Yukon. While engaged on this work the
officer was charged to take note of the
mineral resources of the country, of its
adaptability for agriculture and stock
raising and the fuel and food products for
man and animal.
Captain Abercrombie arrived at Valdes
on the 21st of April. The harbor at Val
des. owing to the proximity of the Japa
nese current. Is accessible at all seasons
of the year to ships of any size, except
about a mile and a half at its head. The
only feasible site for a railroad terminal
Is a narrow strip of land three-quarters
of a mile broad, extending up the Lowe
River some five miles and south of a
small stream flowing from Robe Lake.
There is practically a nominal grade up
the valley, passing through Keystone
Canyon with ordinary canyon work, and
emerging on the foot of the plain of the
Inner canyon basin. From that point
there are two feasible routes: one east of
Marshall Pass at the elevation of 1700
feet and down the Tasnuna to the Cop
per River Valley: the other turning north.
SUES TO ENFORCE
ITS COMMANDS
New Tactics of Com
merce Commission.
ST. PAUL, Jan. 28.â The Interstate
Commerce Commission, in an action
brought in the United States Circuit
Court against the Northern Pacific Rail
road Company, shows a desire to make
effective by appeal to the Federal courts
those orders of the commission which for
months have been to a large extent disre
garded by railroad companies. The Com
missioners are said to have now adopted a
procedure that will revolutionize their re
lations with transportation companies. If
tho courts grant the assistance that the
new procedure demands, the Interstate
Commerce Commission will hereafter be a
tribunal that can punish instead of a
friend that can advise. The bill is a pe
tition that the court compel the Northern
Pacific Company to answer the commis
sion's charge that the company has con
tinued to ignore an order issued by the
commission last November relative to the
adjustment of rates on certain commodi
ties from the Twin Cities, and other Min
nesota and Wisconsin points and Eastern
cities.
In June, 1899 the George Tilston Milling
Company of St. Cloud and the City of St.
Cloud filed separate complaints with, the
commission, alleging that the Northern
Pacific Company was charging the milling
company, and various St. Cloud concerns
more for transporting property for a
shorter distance than for transporting the
same property a longer distance along the
same line and in the same direction. Such
discrimination is a violation of the inter
state commerce act. It was charged that
the rate from St. Cloud to Superior and
Eastern points was higher than from the
Twin Cities. Anoka and Elk River to Su
perior and the same Eastern points.
The matter was heard by the commis
sion in this city last August. After con-
Eideration an order was issued last No
vember, which, it is said, the railway
company has continuously disregarded.
Pending the decision of the case the
court is petitioned to restrain the railway
company from continuing to violate the
commission's order. The defendant is to
appear in court March 5.

ZL RICHARD HI.
The Play as an Acting Drama.
It must never be forgotten that Shake
speare as a dramatist was a professional
playwright. His plays were written for
Immediate use upon the stage. If we
would think of men as Shakespeare
thought of them we must think of them
as acting dramas.
Shakespeare is usually credited with
giving to the world the world's concep
tions of English history so far as the
historical characters ri his plays are con
cerned. If this is true of any historical
character of Shakespeare's it is especially
true of his King Richard 111. The world
in general knows little" and cares less for
any Richard 111 other_ than _him whom
Shakespeare drew.
When reading "King Richard III" we
take some Interest In the subordinate
characters of the play. The Lady Anne,
Queen Elizabeth, Queen Margaret, tho
Â¦iekness. hiccoughed out the words. "Mr
old complaint." The aptness of his Â¦elf
description was too ridiculous to remain
unrebuked. He was hissed off the sta?e.
And yet it Is doubtful if a greater Rich
ard 111 than Cooke has ever been known.
Cooke. it may be said, was the first
great actor that ever crossed the Atlantic
to play in the United States. This he did
in 1310. His principal play, of course, was
"King Richard III." His success was
enormous. But his "old complaint" snon
proved too much for him. He died In
New York, untimely. In ISI2.
King Richard 111 was one of the princi
pal roles of that greatest of Shakesperean
actors. Edmund Kean. Critics differ as to
thf< relative excellence of Kean's King
Richard and some other of his Shakes
perean parts. Hazlltt, however, who no
doubt was the greatest dramatic critic of
Kean's day, says that Kean's impersona
tion of the character was the most re
fined and the most appropriately versatile
of any the stage had known. In the scene
with Anne, he said, no one could have
equaled Kean but "the first tempter."
SAFE BREAKERS .
SHOT BY POLICE
Two Are Killed and One Wounded
While Resisting Arrest in a
Quincy Hotel.
QUINCY, 111., Jan. 28.â Quincy police of
ficers last night killed two expert safe
blowers supposed to be from Chicago, and
wounded another badly. The tragedy In
cluded a running fight through a hotel.
In which the armed burglars were pur
sued by the officers. The men are be
lieved to be those who recently operated
In Illinois cities, making a speciaJty of
cracking safes In building and loan of
fices.
On January 6 the safe of the Adams
County Building and Loan Association
was blown open at the noon hour and
cash and securities amounting to $20,000
taken. Saturday three men came to
Moecker's Hotel and registered from Kan
sas City. The proprietor recognized their
handwriting as being the same as that
of the men who came here January 5
and whom he afterward suspected as be
ing crooks. He warned the police, and
when one went out he was shadowed by
Detective Koch. The stranger acted
Queerly and the officer finally appeared,
showing his star, and asked the suspect
to go to the station and explain himself.
The man drew a pistol and pointed it at
the officer's heart, but as he did so Koch
flashed his own and fired four shots.
Three took effect and the man fell dead.
This happened at 11 o'clock Saturday
night. Meanwhile the officers had exam
ined the baggage of the suspects and
found that it included burglar tools, skele
ton keys, dynamite sticks and nitroglyc
erin. When the other two men returned
to the hotel at 2 o'clock they learned of
the tragedy and found the hotel sur
rounded by officers. They ran into the
hotel saloon and loaded their revolvers.
Then there was a running fight in the
hotel corridors. One man reached the
street, pursued by Chief of. Police John
Ahearn. lie turned to flre and as he did
so Ahearn sent a bullet through hs skull.
He died in a few minutes. The third man
was shot by Officer Charnhorst as he was
running upstairs and sank to the floor
with a broken hip. He was captured,
but refused to say who his accomplices

monds and Jewelry and plenty of money.
Skeleton keys were found on all of them.
When the two men came here January
5 they registered as J. M. Burt and H. * .
Crow'ley. Saturday Burt was registered
as C. H. Rogers. From letters found on
him it appears that he also has the name
of C. H. Prince of Chicago. The wounded
man refused to give his name. The men
are believed to have been three or tne
best workers in the country
OMAHA, Jan. 25.-The Quincy -safe

WAHNEH'S REMEDIES.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 29, 1900.
BRYAN TO LEAD
THE POPULISTS
Nominated by That Party, He Will
Force the Democrats to
Indorse Him.
AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 28.â The Populists
of Texas publicly announce that Hon.
William Jennlngrs Bryan will accept the
nomination of that party for President if
It be tendered him. The following circu
lar letter, outlining the plan of action for
the coming campaign, was to-day issued
by Chairman J. H. Foster of the Twelfth
Congressional District, I who claims to
have obtained his information and the
propositions outlined direct from the na
tional headquarters. The circular letter
Is addressed to all county chairmen:
Dear Sir: You are no doubt aware of the
fact that if the Bryan Democracy, when they
meet in national convention, reaffirm the Chi
cago platform of 1596 with a direct legislation
plan as an issue, and It seems probable that
they will nominate W. J. Bryan and some irre
proachable Southern man. that -such action will
be the death of our party. Should the Democ
racy do this it will be only a repetition of their
policy and plans, and, like their advocacy of
16 to 1. be shortlived. In view of such ac
tion on the cart of this new-born Democracy
it is the duty of every Populist who loves the
principles he advocates to lend his aid to
thwart the destruction of his party.
A plan has been suggested and Is being dis
cussed all over the nation. The details of this
plan are In part:
That when our national convention assembles
it reaffirm the Omaha platform, with direct
legislation as the paramount issue, nominate
William J. Bryan (and the assurance has been
given by Mr. Bryan's friends that he will ac
cept the nomination) and some Southern Popu
list: that the free silver Republicans will In
dorse the platform and its candidates; that Mr.
Bryan"s friends will go before the National De
mocratic convention with a demand for the
Indorsement of the Populist convention, and. It
is anmed. they will not refuse. In the event
that they do Mr. Bryan may refuse the nomina
tion at the hands of the Democracy. This ac
tion of Itself will by the Democrats, stsrnal
their utter defeat and also that of the Popu
lists, but defeat, will lay at the door of the
Democrats. Â¦Â¦'.â¢â¢.Â¦ â â .
We want discussion, open, fair and full, of
these propositions, and when you send dele
gates to the Congressional convention at San
Antonio on February 17 let them be Instructed
as to the sentiments of the Populists In their
respective counties.

The contest between the Jockeys now
riding at the Oakland track for the tro
phy offered by the California Jockey
Club la apt to become a decidedly Inter
esting affair before the close of the meet-
Ing. Bullman still holds the lead in the
number of points earned, but Jenkins Is
loomfng ifp as a dangerous second, while
Spencer, the "Iceman," Is by no means out
of the race. The latter is handicapped
somewhat by not being able to ride as
light as the two leaders. The score to date
Is as follows:

MASON TIES
THE COAST
RIFLE RECORD
Scores 229 and 232 in Twenty
Shots on the German
Ring Target.
The coast record of 461 points with rifle
on the German ring target, held by Dr.
Leo O. Rodgers, was tied yesterday by
F. E. Mason of the Golden Gate Rifle Club
at Shell Mound Park. In shooting for tha
Bushnell trophy he scored 229 and 232 in
twenty shots. D. W. McLaughlln was a
close second in the contest for the valu
able prize, with 229 and 21S. In another
ten-shot he made 216. For the gold medal
offered by the club Mason scored 225, 229
and 223 on the same target, while C. M.
Henderson reeled off 230 points for a silver
medal.
These fine scores were made in the face
of a poor light and other unfavorable
weather conditions, and are considered
phenomenal under the circumstances.

by sheer weight and strength, and the ball was in the cen
ter of the field.
The next scrimmage brought on a small sized riot that
nearly ended the game. A member of Company H landed a
right swing on Kavanaugh's jaw. and within a minute
players and spectators were mixed up in a pitched battle.
Ten minutes* intermission was then taken to settle differ
ences and stanch wounds. The ball seesawed back and
forth, and when the half closed it was practically in the
center of the field.
Toward the close of the half I^ee had his forehead
split open and Ahem had his ankle severely wrenched.
Ahem had to retire and Monroe went in at center, Rodg
ers going to left end. The Snowballs kicked off to Ewing.
who was tackled and dropped the hall. Kavanaugh picked
it up and ran to within ten yards of his goal, when Mc-
Stocker landed on his wishbone and prevented a touch
down. The local* glued their line and got the ball on
downs. They were then given ten yards on an offside
play, and Dlnstnore made the star run of the day, one of
forty yards through a scattered field. On the next lineup
Dinsmore tried fora field goal, but failed. The ball was
brought out to the twenty-flve-yard line and again put in
play, and after a number of attempts had been made to
advance the ball time was called.- V-:
Credit is due McStocker for saving the day for Com
pany 11. Atkinson and Monroe played hard for the local
eleven, and Lee. Kavanaugh and Soanes put up the best
work for the Snowballs. The teams lined up as follows:

Exciting Game of Football on the Folsom-Street Grounds.
ON a 60jrery field and in a pelting: rain, two elevens,
one flying: the banner of Company H. league of
the Cross Cadets, and the other widely known tis
the Snowballs of Vallejo. pushed, filuegedand dragged
each other for an hour at Sixteenth and Folsom street*
yesterday afternoon, and at the end of that time neither
side had scored. A "Donnybrook fair" was mild In com
parison to the contest that waged on the slippery grid
iron.
Duringr the height of th<? excitement the sympathiz
ers of both teams engaged in combat, and to-day many en
thusiasts will display blackened eyes and other marks of
battle as signs of the lively part they took in what was in
have been the concluding game of a series. Throughout
the game two special policemen labored to keep the crowd
off the field, but their efforts were futile. The crowd would
not respect the whitewashed sidelines, but occupied points
of vantage In the center of the field, bo that when a full
back kicked to pain distance the pigskin would alight
among the spectators, who overran the field like an army
of ants. Withal, it was a tremedously exciting game,
even if it was gory. Both teams played with a vengeance,
and the fact or neither team scoring a touchdown attests
the fierceness of the play.
The game was delayed at the start by a dispute over
various players. Differences having been adjusted. Com
pany H won the toss, and Atkinson put the ball Into play
with a long punt to the Snowballs' fifteen-yard line. Mc-
Donough essayed to catch It. but It passed
over his head and was picked up by a
fellow player, who was downed in his tracks by Kr
by a fellow player, who was downed in his tracks by Er
lenheim. The latter tackled so hard that he was knocked
Insensible and had to be carried off the field, McStocker
taking his place at left half. The Snowballs secured the
ball on downs, and finding that they could not make their
distance Soanes kicked for twenty-five yards. Ewing fum-i
bled and a Snowball fell on the ball. The visitors soon lost
the ball on downs and the local team did the same. The
Vallejo boys then made a straight plunge of fifteen yards

<w=3XERCISES commemorative of
â Q the forty-seventh anniversary
of the Young Men's Christian
, ' o Association on this coast were
held yesterday afternoon In
the auditorium of the Young Men's
Christian Association building, on tho
corner of Mason and Ellis streets.
President Rolla V. Watt presided and
opened the meeting with a few re
marks appropriate to the occasion, in
which he took the opportunity of call-
Ing the attention of the audience to
the fact that the members of the New
York branch of the association wera
also holding their forty-seventh anni
versary exercises. The San Francisco
and New York divisions of the asso
ciation are the oldest ones on the
American continent, with the excep
tion of the division In Montreal, Can
ada.
Following President Watt's address a
hymn was sung by the entire congre
gation. Then a scripture lesson waÂ«i
read, which was followed by a prayer
by Rev. John Carrlngton of Siam.
After that General Secretary H. J. Mc-
Coy made a statement of the condition
of {he association. In his statement
Mr. McCoy called attention to the
splendid showing made by the associa
tion. He showed that the member
ship had reached the satisfactory num
ber of 1426, which was an increase of
300 over the number of members re
ported for 189 S. He also spoke of the
advantages enjoyed by those belonging
to the association and of the facilities
offered them for moral. Intellectual and
physical improvement by the reading
rooms, gymnasium, night school, salt
-water baths and the literary and de
bating societies, as well as by the nu
merous. Other adjuncts. ,
He spoke of the debt on the building,
which he said amounted to $107,000, and
stated that it was the Intention of the
board of directors to reduce that debt

BARK FERRIS
THOMPSON HAS
A CLOSE CULL
Nearly Turns Turtle in
the Creek.
A Rush to Purchase Vessels for the
Cape Nome Trade â Brig Harriet
Q. Sails for Honolulu
With Fodder.
The old bark Ferris S. Thompson is
again In trouble. For over three months
she has been playing in hard luck and last
Saturday it looked at one time as though
the'end of the old craft had come.
While making port from Puget Sound
the Thompson drifted on to the "potato
patch" and after considerable trouble was
towed off by the eteamer Homer. As soon
as the cargo of lumber was discharged
the vessel was put on the drydock and
examined. It was found necessary to re
calk her and make some minor repairs.
Saturday a full force of calkers were at
work on the bark. Suddenly the Thomp
son began to list over and before the
workmen could escape the port rail was
under water and about a dozen calkers
were swimming for their lives. Those who
were working on the starboard side of tne
vessel slid down to the keel, which came
up out of the water as the port rail went
down, and walking along It made their
escape ashore. After some hard work
the bark was got on an eveii keel again
and to-day the work of. calking her will
be completed. Many of the workmen lost
their tools, but nearly all of them were
recovered at low water. The Thompson
will go north with the cannery fleet.
The Alviso steamer F. M. Smith had a
narrow escape from going down in her
berth at Clay street wharf yesterday.
Coming down the slough she struck a
snag and sprang a leak. It was not a
very serious affair and the steam
er made her landing in due time.
While getting alongside she bumped hard
and that opened'up the seams started by
the snag and soon the water was pouring
Into the hull. She began to settle by the
head and Captain Smith at once tele
phoned for one of the red-stack tugs. The
Sea Queen was soon alongside the sink
ing steamer and In half an hour the F.
M. Smith was pumped out. The Queen
then took her in tow and beached her on
the Mission mud flats. To-day the Smith
will be put on the ways and overhauled,
after which she will resume her run on
the Alviso route.
Four of the coasting fleet are making
long passages and the lumber, men and
ship owners are wondering If one of them
has not met with a' mishap. On January
22 the British ship Samoena, when thirty
miles west-southwest of the Farallones,
passed a small raft of lumber that looked
like the deckload of a schooner and also
a quantity of wreckage. The schooners
Abble and Western Home arrived yester
day from Coos Bay after a seven days'
run, while the Lizzie Prien took eight days
to come from Coqullle River. None of
these vessels report heavy weather. The
schooner Melancthon Is 1 now out Mxteen

days from Willapa Harbor, the schooner
Sailor Boy eighteen days from Tacoma

WINS SILVER MEDAL
IN ESSAY CONTEST
Robert McCarthy.
EOBERT MCCARTHY'S ability as
an essayist and a declaimer won
him a silver medal yesterday aft
ernoon and the right to represent
his district in the forthcoming essay con
test of the League of the Cross. Young
McCarthy was pitted against Sergeant
George C. Walsh and Sergeant Chris
Buckley in the annual essay contest of
the First District, League of the Cross,
comprising St. Paul's. St. Peter's, St.
James' and St. John's branches, held yes
terday afternoon in St. Paul's Hall,
Twenty-ninth and Church streets.
The "subject of the essay was, "The
Moral and Physical Effect of Cigarette
Smoking on the Youth of America?' The
young essayists did justice to their theme
and interested the large attendance by
the masterly way they handled it. Their
strong points against the habit aroused
grt-at applause. So close was the com
petition that it took Miss Julia Coffey,
Brother George and Richard O'Connor,
the judges, a long time to decide the win
ner. . ,
Rev. Philip O'Ryan, spiritual advisor of
the organization, pinned the trophy on
the breast of young McCarthy amid the
loud plaudits of those present. He also
delivered Knme appropriate words suitable
to the occasion. Judge Frank J. Murasky
delivered a special address, in which he
gave his young auditors some stronp ad
vice. He told them to persevere In their
efforts to down the noxious weed and to
abjure li<iuor, to study hard and make
every effort to become pood citizens.
Captain J. 11. Reilly acted as chairman
and under his direction the following
numbers were rendered: Song, "Noel," by

A GOOD OTHELLO;
A HORRIBLE IAGO
"Othello" without music did not prove
as attractive at the Columbia last night
ns did the operatic version so recently
a success at the Tivoli. Between the rain
and the degenerate taste of the public
which likes not Shakespeare for Shake
speare's sake, the audience was positively
puny.
James' Othello Is too well known to
need more than passing comment. It lies
In his best vein and is perhaps his best
part. There are iiiequalitk-s in his act
ing, however, and he does not appear to
advantage in 'the more tender passages
with Depdimona. Although at times the
turbulence of his passion is excessive, he
never quite loses the curb of artistic pru
rfrnce and rants with a free rein. His im
portance in this role, coupled with his
acting of Hamlet and Macbeth and con
trasted with his essays in comedy, only
serves to emphasise the fact that the
habit of Beriousness becomes him best.
In criticizing Mirs Kldder there Is over
the temptation to compare her various
t-fforts one with another. Either she is
not so good as in some other part or she
Is better than she was in this or that.
If, however, fhe were to be judged as
one would Judge an actress whom one
sees for the first time, she would be ac
cepted in anything she has done as a
charming and Intelligent artist. Such she
is as Desdemona, but no more. Should
we see her, however, for the first time as
Lady Macbeth, for example. I think the
verdict would he that she is potentially
great. There is the same, fault to be
found with her Desdemona as with her
Ophelia: she Is not sincerely girlish and
her naivete is mere play acting. I know
Just how badly she would do- Juliet, and
i w^-'iid like to 'see how well she could do

REV. DR. HEMPHILL DELIVERS THE ADDRESS.
Ing year. As the object of the associa
tion is so well known and so praise
worthy, he said he felt sure that there
would not be found lacking outside
help to relieve the association from at
least part of the heavy burden it is
now carrying.
He also called the atention of the
audience to the splendid work being
done by the ntght school, which 13
practically self-supporting. The num
ber of men now In attendance is 253,
and ten teachers instruct them in sev
enteen different branches of learning.
It will also be the endeavor of the
board of directors to enlarge the scope
of this school as much as possible In
order to extend the sphere of the good
it is dolnir.
Mr. McCoy concluded by referring to
the excellent work that has been done
by members of the associatoin among
the soldiers in camp and on the trans
ports, which work has been so appre
ciated by the Government that It has
asked that others be sent to reinforce
the two secretaries now in the Philip
pines.
Following Mr. McCoy a selection was
rendered by the association male chor
us, after which Rev. John Hemphill,
the speaker of the day, arose and de
livered a splendid address, in which he
pleaded with his hearers to do each hlÂ»
or her part in helping out the glorious
promise of national and religious
greatness that has dawned with the
new century-
me speaker began by comparing the
association of to-day with the condi
tion of the same society thirty years
ago, when he first came to San Fran
cisco, and when the great Moody took
It in hand and started it on the path
to success. He told of the struggles
and hopes, of the setbacks and fears
that had surrounded the path at the
beginning, and how it was built up by
Moody, who overcame everything that
stood In his way.
Then Mr. Hemphill proceeded to
trace the history of the last two cen
turies and of the progress that had
been made by humanity during that
period. He spoke of the progress of
America in particular. He showed
how the United States had led the on
ward march, and then, getting down to
the West In particular, he demon
strated to his hearers the great future
that was in store for the inhabitants
of this coast, which, he said, would
before the close of the twentieth cen
tury lead the world in richness and
population, as he hoped it would l^nd
the world in righteousness and good
works.
The address of Mr. Hemphill closed
the exercises, save the hymn and bene
diction, which immediately followed
his utterances.

The claims of Roman Catholicism on
thÂ« modern world wore presented in a
lecture by Father Wyman of San Fran
dseo before the Congress of Religions at
the First Unitarian Church to-night. He
t-aia in part:
"If some one should ask me what I
considered the highest act of which the
mind of man is capable I should say it
must be an act of the mind in reference
to' God, because God is the highest be
ing that we can possibly conceive of or
imaplne. But the knowledge we liave
ul <Jud and divine things by the light
Â«.>i reason alone is very imperfect,
i-aith Is necessary in oruer that man

*'jutb is the sunlight ot the soul.
Christ commissioned his apostles to
So -into all the world and preach the
Â£ospel. and lie promised to be with
LHem ail days, even to the consumma
tion of the world. How is Christ with
them to-day V That Christians to-day
m*y hayÂ« the same faith that they
hue In the apostolic age. we hold it to
be n^Â¦tâ¢es^a^)â¢ that tije same living au
thority s-hould exist now as in those
<Ju>>. The rule or faith, then 1 con
clude, must be the living authority
which Christ has established on earth,
via., His noly Catholic church.
"The Bible taken by itself alone can
not be a sufficient rule of faith, be
cause && ixncrijreted by private indi
viduals it fails to produce either cer
tainty or unity of faith. The Bible,
moreover, is the product of the church.
It Â»'&Â» written bjr different men at dif
ferent per.'ods ol time and in different
languages, and, as history shows, was
not compiled, until the church had
:.Â¦â¢_â¢â¢- 1; ;:j existence about Suo years.
"The Catholic Church has condemned
the doctrine of total depravity. It is
the teaciilag of the Catholic Church
i::;it Jesui Christ was a divine person,
li.at he was both God and man. He
says. '1 and the Father are one.' The
perpetuity of the doctrines of apostles
itad the fcacrainents instituted by
Christ shows the necessity of the per
jMjtulty of the visible church. None
Â»:il deny that this church alone has
rtldbto unity as its essential mark.
On the whole, we have reason to say
that it there be a form of Christianity

such v form of religion is not unlike
the Christianity of the nicene era. A
church which leaches false doctrine
cannot have such a harmonious creed

olic church.
"And how *t- me conclude by sum

In thanking Father Wyman. Rev. B
Fay Mills, pastor of the Unitarian Church,
"We must all realize that we have come
â¢arough the Catholic church. If I were
not a Unitarian I would be a Catholic. It
is but a difference of frf-*Â»dom of beV.ef

done much for the enlightenment of tt*a

QUAKERS COME
TOGETHER IN A
GRAND REUNION
Big Rally of the Soci
ety of Friends.
CHASM BETWEEN CHRISTIAN
DENOMINATIONS.
Silent Workers Accomplish Much
Good Among the Needy and De
serving â Maintains Free â¢
School for Children.
Several hundred members of the Society
of Friends held a reunion at Swarthmore
Hall on Harrison street yesterday. It was
one of the largest gatherings of Friends
held in this city for many years, and the
meeting house was crowded to such an
extent that it became .necessary to re
move the temporary partition by which
the interior of the building is divided.
Rev. 'Isaac Wilson of Ontario, Canada,
was the leader of the rally, and It was the
fame of this well-known Quaker orator
that brought together the large gathering.
Swarthmore Hall is a duplicate of the
meeting-houses of the Friends- in New
England and Eastern Canada, and caused
Brother AVllson to remark that it almost
seemed like being at home. Its windows
are of many small panes, the roof la very
low, and the celling is of weather-stained
cheese-cloth. The platform contained no
seat 3 that were more comfortable than
those in the body of the hall. Some of the
women wore the Quaker bonnet, such as
has been seen in prints of a century past.
Altogether, the scene was quite unique in
the religious life of San Francisco.
Rev Joel Bean of San Jose presided, and
in a brief speech referred to the visitors
who had come three thousand miles to
conduct a Friends revival. ,
After a brief period of silence. Rev.
Isaac Wilson commenced a forceful ad
dress which lasted nearly an hour. ->
"It is the custom of the - boclety of
Friends," he said, -to subordinate the hu
man intelligence to the divine will, and
I think that such a practice needs no
apology or justlncation. Certainly no
mind or soul in touch with God ever waits
long for an inspiration in an age where
there is so much of Gods work to do. I
have long thought that the various de
nominations of Christians are closer to
gether than they think. They appear to
agree on the great essentials of Chrlsti
anitv but are contented to diner regard
ing the important details. I think that if
all Christians would take the broadest
possible view of my text for to-day the
story of the Prodigal Son, that there
would be much more unity and a better
understanding regarding Gods purposes
for mankind. No story has ever been writ
ten that is so truly human and so su
perbly illustrates the plan of God so well
as that of the prodigal.. It is alike an ex
ample for the Quaker and Christian of
every denomination. It destroys the
foundation of the doctrine that man is
not a free agent and shows positively that
man carves out his own destiny, and is
Kiven every opportunity to exercise his
will. The 'lesson of the prodigal is the
lesson for thee and me." 'â v , -
In the afternoon there was a Sunday
school rally at Sunshine Hall. 036 Harrison
.street Rev. Mr. Wilson addressed the
children and told of the benefits to be de
rived from inculcating in the mind, while
it is yet young, the principles of true and
useful religion.
The distinguished visitors also inspected
the work of the "Silent Workers," whose
headquarters are at Sunshins Hall.
This worthy organization was estab
lished about a year and a half ago by the
Society of Friends, but in ita mission it
recognizes no creed. Its aim is to make
good men and women of the children of
the needy who come within its sphere of
influence, which covers four blocks of the
city's most densely populated district.
Sunshine Hall Is a free training school for
little ones whose parents are pecuniarily
or intellectually unable to equip their
minds and bodies with the health essen
tial to success in the grim life-battle be
fore them.
Â¦ More than 400 children are now receiv
ing the benefits bestowed by the Silent
Workers. A superintendent and three as
sistants comprise the kindergarten tute
lary, devote all their time to the work.
Then there are about forty other women
who give as much time to the cause as
they can spare. Their names are never
given for publication.
The Silent Workers are helped by phi
lanthropists who are equally silent. They
receive clothing and books- from donors
throughout this State and the East, and
doubtless these donations will bo materi
ally incrensed after the amount of pood
accomplished by the efforts of the Silent
Workers become better known. â¢ ,

CALIFORNIA WARS OVER
MINERAL AND OIL LANDS
AS a result of the meeting of the ex
ecutive committee of thÂ© Califor
nia Miners' Association, held Fri
day evening in accordance with thÂ©
call of President W. C. Ralston,
the association is again actively engaged
In an effort to get thÂ© mineral lands bill
through Congress.
After a discussion of how bÂ«Â»t to uae thÂ©
Influence of the association in behalf of
thÂ© measure the matter was left with
the mineral lands . committee, of which
John M. Wright, chairman, and which,
on motion of J. H. Neff, was instructed
to prepare a letter presenting tho reasons
In favor of thÂ© bill to be forwarded to
each member of Congress. President
Ralston reported that on his recent visit
to Washington he found the California
delegation united in favor of thÂ© bill, the
Interests of which are in thÂ© hand* of
Congressman dÂ© Vries, who Introduced it
and who is a member of the House com
mittee with which It rests. The -chair
maji of the committee favors the bill, De
Vries is active in its behalf and the pros
pects are that it will be favorably re
ported at this session. Most of the West
ern members are ready to support It and
it may get through after all tnese years
of fighting to save to the mining industry
millions of acres of public mineral land
which the railroad company has been
steadily and illegally patenting' and with
drawing from the prospector and miner
for whom they were reserved.
The association will not make thÂ© vig
orous and expensive campaign it made in
1594 and at other times, when several
thousand dollars were spent in preparing
maps and data and sending men to Wash
ington to lead thÂ© fight. . The aKeumenta
tlve circular ordered is about the measure
of the work now in sight. Congressman
de Vries is regarded as able to manage
the Washington campaign and he prob
ably' Is. Â«s
The solÂ© opposition comes, of course,
from thÂ© Southern Pacific Company,
which has been able to prevent the pas
sage of any such law in two former Con
gresses and whose lawyers and lobbyists
here and in Washington now declare that
they will oppose the measure in every
way they can, which is to be expected.
The railroad people give no Just reasons
for opposing it and can glvÂ© none. They
simply want the land and fight for what
they want with political pulls, misrepre
sentation, legislative tricks to secure de
lay and opposition with all the arts of the
lobbyist.
Just here, by the way, is wherÂ© the
miners of the State have an Interest In
tho pending Senatorial election at Sacra
mento. If the mineral lands bill should
be passed by the House of Representa
tives there is yet the Senate in which a
grave may be due for it. Senator Per
kins is understood to be ready to vote
for It, but what will be the fortunes of
tho bill if a Southern Pacific Senator
takes his seat and assumes to represent
the miners of California? That the South
ern Pacific Company Is deeply concerned
to prevent any interference with its ap
propriation of public land, and that any
Senatorial friend of the railroad will try
to defeat the bill are too plain to need as
sertion.
The mineral lands issue is a familiar
one to the miners, but its chief features
may be briefly recalled as It again comes
to the front. The railroad grants involv
ed are those made in the sixties to the
Central Paclflo. California and. Oregon,
Western Pacific and Southern Pacific
companies. They were first given alter
nate sections within twenty-mile limits
each side of their right of way, but oc
cupied and mineral lands were withheld.
So much of -the grants were thus lost to
them that they later secured lieu land
grants of ten miles on each side of their
original grants, in which they might se
lect lands in place of those reserved in
the original, grants, but mineral lands
were again specifically reserved from se
lection and patent, the declared purpose
of Congress being to keep the mineral
lands in the public domain for the bene
fit of the miner.
The best object lesson on thÂ© situation
is a map of California Bhowing thesÂ©
sixty-mile belts sweeping from the Ore
gon line dow.n through the State to the
desert and across the great Sierra Ne
vada mining region. The railroad has se
cured patent to some millions of acres,
and the patenting process goes busily on.
In the mountains it was the mineral as
well as the timber lands that were wanted
for their future value, and tho company
has always been able to take what it
wanted, regardless of the exception of
mineral lands. For years-it was aided by
former Land Commissioner Lameroux,
who held land to be agricultural unless
mineral was shown not only to exist but
to exist in paying quantities. A protea
tant had little show unless he could prove
that a paying mine was in actual opera
tion on the subdivision at issue. The min
eral regions had been but little prospected,
and the way the law was carried out was
a monstrous wrong. A section would be
patented to the railroad, though it showed
mineral and though mines had been
opened all around, it. The whole Coffee
Creek region in Trinity County, where so
many discoveries have recently been
made, is checkered by the alternate rail
road sections as is that whole northern
region. In the early eighties, when the
company went to gobbling up Placer
County lands, leading miners there Mcd
protests, but in vain, and in every ngnt
the railroad has won wnat it wanted.
The railroad company has been hustling
the patenting process in recent years. It
secured some hundreds of thousands of
acres about 1594, and lists embracing over
100 000 acres are now awaiting approval.
I>urlng these years the company has won
the cream of what it wanted, and im
mense areas of land full of mineral stores
are lost to the prospector. Thousands of
acres of railroad land are ribbed with
quartz veins which are hidden by soil and
Only a beginning in the discovery and
development of the State's mineral re
sources has been accomplished. Tho pros
pector is the pioneer of development
and he goes where free opportunity is
open to him. He does not often prospect
on farms or other land privately used. If
he prospects railroad sections he may
make a deal with the railroad if he wants
to but railroad ownership practically pre
cludes prospecting of mineral land. The

are lessened by this construction of the
mining area. Millions of acres have thus
been withdrawn from exploitation. It is
not too late to save "what is left and
every Interest In the State, except that of
the railroad company, demands the pass
age of the mineral lands bill.
The bill now pending Is similar to the.
Montana-Idaho act. passed a few years
ago under exactly similar circumstances
and which successfully accomplished its
purpose in those States.
The De Vrles bill directs thÂ© Secretary
of the Interior to classify, through com
missioners, the - unpatented lands within
the railroad land grants In California,
segregating the mineral and non-mineral
lands by legal subdivisions.
Pour districts are created out of the
existing land districts. One Includes the
Redding and Susanville districts, one the
Marysville and Sacramento, one the Stock
ton and Ban Vrancisco and one the Visa
lla, Independence and Los Angeles .dis
tricts. Each classification district is given
a separate board of three commissioners,
at least one of whom shall be a practical
miner resident In California. The pay is
$10 a day of service. The classification
must be completed in four years. The
commissioners shall take and file testi
mony, may summon witnesses, etc. The
chief feature is the manner of classifica
tion, and this Is given In section 3 as fol
lows:
That all said lands shall be classified as min
eral which by reason of valuable mineral de
posits aro open to exploration, occupation and
purchase under the provisions of the United
States mining laws, and the Commissioners
in making the classification hereinafter provided
for shall take into consideration the mineral
discovered or developed on or adjacent to such
land and the geological formation of all lantla
to be examined and classified, or the lands ad
jacent thereto, and the reasonable probabilities
of such land containing- valuable mineral de
posits because of Its said formation, location
or character. The classification herein, provided
for shall be by each legal subdivision where
thÂ« lands have been surveyed. If the lands
examined aro not surveyed classification shall
bÂ« mads by tracts of such extent and desig
nated by such natural or artificial boundaries
to identify them as the Commissioners may
determine. Where patents have issued for min
ing around In any section of land this shall
be taken as r-rlrna facie evidence that the
forty-acre- subdivision within which it is lo
cated Is mineral land; provided that the word
"mineral," where it occurs in this act. shall
not be held to include Iron or coal; and pro
vided further, that the examination and classi
fication of lands hereby authorised shall be
made without reference or regard to any pre
vious examination or report or classification
thereof.
Classifications must be filed monthly In
the District Land Office and at Washing
ton be advertised, go Into the official
maps, be approved by the Secretary of the
Interior, and when classifications are pro
tested the United States IMstrict Attorney
shall represent the United States.
It is supposed that the cost will be about
one and a third cents per acre for the
13.000,000 acres. No further patents would
be granted pending classification.
The railroad has been and la taking
what does not and should not belong to
it. It was told in the start that It should
not hate mineral lands, and it has neither
a legal nor a moral right to them. It gets
them by calling them agricultural because
no thundering stamp batteries are making
their towering pines and burled sulphu
rets tremble just now and by beating tho
miner who may try to prove a negative.
The proposed law intends to simply de
termine what the railroad and the public
are entitled to, and to do it by a fair and
efficient method. As President Ralston
has pointed out, no member of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association will be per
sonally benefited. The interests conserved
are purely public ones. The railroad will
not t>e wronged In the slightest because
there will be withheld from it only what
was never given to it. It will make up
its quota from what lieu lands are classed
as non-mineral. The measure ts of vital
importance to the State and deserves uni
versal support.
This same mineral lands bill ought to
make the oil men prick up their ears con
siderably in these days of woe for publio
oil lands. That oil lands would be class
ed as mineral under this bill is not here
declared, but that would seem to follow,
and if so, scrippers, homesteaders and
railroad companies would soon be at a
disadvantage where oil lands of the. pub
lic domain are concerned. ThÂ© languaja
of section 3 of the bill would allow the
Commissioners to class as mineral land
bearing no oil indications, if oil wells on
adjacent lands and geological formations
observed showed the presence of under
lying oil-bearing strata. Lands so class
ed would necessarily be reserved for min
eral location alone.
At the meeting the other night the Cali
fornia Miners' Association definitely as
sumed the cause of the oil industry by
directing the mineral lands committee to
prepare a bill for Introduction in Con
gress giving to the oil prospector rights
similar to those enjoyed by tunnel locat
ors. By the tunnel right law the locator
of a tunnel who prosecutes the same with
prescribed diligence is given 1500 feet of
any blind mineral veins he may discover
and he is protected from surface locators
for a time. By the proposed law the lo
cator of an oil claim would be protected
against all comers during a time sufficient
for him to determine by boring whether
oil existed below or not.
As the laws and decisions stand, this Is
the only remedy apparent for Uie oil pros
pector. A mineral location is not valid
unless a "discovery" of mineral has been
accomplished. As It is now there may be
eight quarter sections surrounding a cen
tral one with flowing oil wells on each,
proving conclusively that the oil-bearing
stratum underlies the central one, but if
no oil has actually been discovered on
that central one tt remains agricultural
land, open to the homesteader and scrip
per. The pending mineral lands bill would
make "mineral land" of that central tract
probably, and the other proposed law
would give an oil man a chance to dis
cover oil.
That central quarter asctlon may be
used to illustrate the case of Alexander
vs. Canfleld and Chanslor, now before
United States Circuit Judge Ross in Los
Angeles. Productive oil wells are on three
sides of the land in issue. Canfleld and
Chanslor drilled 150 feet or so toward the
oil formation when C. W. Clarke located
forest reserve scrip on It and sued for an
Injunction to restrain the oil men from
discovering oil on their land. If Canfleld
and Chanalor could get deep enough they
would surely make a "discovery" and
make the land "mineral," ousting the
scripper. They assert, by the way. that
they nave done so already, but the plain
tiff has been restrained by "mob violence"
from investigating the defendants' wells.
Last weÂ«k Judge Ross ordered commis
sioners to investigate the alleged dlpcov
ery. They ware empowered to sink new
wells adjoining to the exact depth of de
fendants' wells, but not an inch deeper,
the Idea being to Inform the court if a
discovery has yet been made. This clearly
indicates the court's attitude, ilf the oil
men after qostly operations have not
really struck oil It will be handed over
to the scripper, who will get land worth
$1000 an acre for $1 25 scrip. The oil man
has no Bhow. - ."â¢'.: . "
These developments Indicate the com
munity of interest between the California
Miners' Association and the oil industry.
The proposed law for the benefit of thÂ©
oil men was suggested at the laat State
Mining Convention by A. H. Ricketts and
State Mineralogist Cooper. The former
offered a resolution presenting it, but It
was not heeded. Now on presentation by
J. M. Wright the executive committee has
ordered a. bill drawn and presented to
Congress. There does not seem to the
writer any good reason why the oil. men.
r.ow organizing for the protection of their
interests, should not Join and strengthen
further this great association with 9COO
members, or why the association, broad
ening its scope, should not seek and wel
come the co-operation of those interested
in this branch of the mining industry. The
association, with Its prestige and Influence,
would be a far greater power than county
protective associations of oil men. ThÂ©
way seems open and easy for this affilia
tion. J. O. DENNY.

SORRY PLIGHT FOR
CHINESE NEW YEAR
Police Vigilance Relaxed Only to the
Extent of Granting a Few
Concessions.
The preparations for the Chinese New
Year In the Mongolian quarter are some
what limited this year owing to the de
termination of the acting Chief of Police
to force the highbinders to become par
ties to a declaration of perpetual peace',
and the concessions granted thus far have
been few.
On the principal streets stands have
been erected by police permission, where
the wily Chinese may dispose of his holi
day, wares. A number of houses have
commenced the work of decorating and
last evening numbers of Chinese appeared
on the streets. The theaters have been
closed In accordance with custom, and
they will not open again until Tuesday
morning or the first day of festivities.
The use of fireworks has been strictly
forbidden by the police, who still fear that
the compact signed by the Hop Sing Tong
and Suey Sing Tong was not made in
good faith. It is an old practice among
criminal Chinese to explode a number of
firecrackers near a victim and then shoot
htm. The noise of the, fireworks deadens
the report of the pistol, and officers have
much difficulty in apprehending the
shooters.
Yesterday the Suey Sing Tons; rJosted a
notice that they were at peace with the
Hop Sings. The latter organization will
reciprocate in a couple of days.

cf arsenic, is in a critical condition at the
Receiving Hospital. Her chance of re
covery is considered doubtful.
Captain Bohen yesterday detailed De
tective Cody to investigate the case, and
he saw the girl in the hospital. She said
her only reason for taking the poison was
despondency. She denied having been
engaged to Harry de Vol. a young farmer
near Bangor, Butte County, where her
father lives. She also declared the was
not the cause of De VoJ being shot by
S. Binriey, another young farmer. She
paid she had been engaged to Michael
Nieberiing for the past six months and
to no one else. She denied she had twice
before attempted suicide.
Nieberiing, who was arrested Saturday
r.ight on a charge of drunkenness*, was
seen in the city prison by Cody. He ad
mitted that he had been engaged to the
girl and said they came to the city with
htr sister to g<n work before being mar
ried. He worked in Klempp's brewery,
Yuba City, and through Ida's sister. Kate,
who was a servant in Klempp's house, he
became acquainted with Ida, who was
then working in the cannery. She had left
hume in June to go to work in the can
nery. Saturday morning after Kate left
for Marysvil.e Ida told him she also want
ed to go back to Yuba City, and he said
if she would pack up her trunks he would
call In the atternoon sn<l s<re her off. He
returned about 3 o'clock and saw some
thing was wrong with her. She finally
confessed that fhe had takon the poison.
Detective Cody sent a dispatch yester
day afternoon to the girl's brother-in-law.
Edward Dickhouse. Banger, notifying
him of her serious condition. Nieberiing
will probably be released this morning.
He says he will do everything possible for
the girl should she live, and should she
die he will take care of her remains until
her relatives arrive.
DIES OF HIS INJURY.
Francois Bachow Succumbs to What
Was Thought to Be a Slight
Wound.
What was considered but a slight wound
on the head of Francois Bachow, an em
ploye in a tripe factory at Butchertown,
led to his death at the French Hospital
yesterday. Bachow, with some others of
his acquaintance, were celebrating New
Year's night in Butchertown, when two
men got into a fight over some trifling
matter. He attempted to separate them,
when he was hit on the head with a rock,
receiving a slight lacerated wound of the
scalp, which was dressed by a physician.
So slight was the injury that Bachow
attended to his daily work until ten days
ago when he complained of pains in the
back of his Head. He was sent to the
French Hospital for treatment. While
there he had frequent attacks of spasms,
which eventually resulted in his death.
The body was removed to the Morgue,
where an autopsy was held by Dr. Le
land, who found the brain badly contused.
Bachow was unmarried and resided at
1332 Fifth avenue south. He was about 45
years of age and of a quiet disposition.
The police are looking for the man who
threw the rock.
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
he was soon brought out of danger. He
was drunk when he engaged the room and
had accidentally turned on the gas when
retiring.
PACIFIC UNION
MEMBERS WILL
BE SURPRISED
An Unexpected Notice
to Greet Them.
HORACE G. PLATT, DIPLOMAT
LEVIES AN ASSESSMENT AND
THEN ESCAPES THE STORM-
Every Member of the Aristocratic
Organization Must Come Up
With Forty-Five Dollars
for Luxuries.
To-day there will be posted in the Paci
fic Union Club a pleasant little notice tell
ing the members that each one, separate
ly and individually, must come up with
$45 in order to comply with an assessment
that has lately been decided upon so that
the club may pay off some of the $17,000
Indebtedness that it now staggers along
under.
The liability consists of outstanding
debts contracted for a variety of causes,
and the assessment is due to the influ
ence of Horace G. Platt, president of the
club, who ordered the ante, and then real
izing what he had done, escaped on last
night's overland for New York, where he
will remain until the storm his action will
arouse has had time to subside.
It is peculiar, but none the less a fact,
that the willingness of a man to part
with his shekels cannot be measured by
the number of shekels he Is possessed or.
It might be reasonably supposed that the
very wealthy would be more ready to part
with a few dollars than those to whom a
few dollars are a great many. But the
howl that will arise to-day when the no
tice shall have been read will demon
strate that such is not the case. The rich
man loves the long green as fondly as
his less fortunate neighbor, and to no one
is this better known than to Mr. Platt.
He realized that something had to be
done to square the outstanding accounts
of the club, and he also realized that,
while all were in favor of the good things
of life, all were not so ready to "cough
up" for the luxuries they enjoyed. There
was but one course, then, open to him.
Using his Influence for all It was worth
with the board of directors, he got the
order through in proper shape and then
levanted to wait until the clouds should
roll by.
The order will come in the nature of a
surprise to most of the members of the
aristocrauc organization, and when they
congregate around the bulletin board to
night there will be opinions expressed of
the oruer and their absent president
which will be a liberal education in invec
tive for those who have not as yet mas
tered the English language in all its beau
tiiul and expressive flexibility of detail.
LOUIS WINTERS.
57v? FTER years of grieving for his dead wife, Louis Winters, a clerk 31
// \\ years of age, committed suicide Saturday night by shooting himself In
h \ the breast with a 3S-caliber revolver. The cause of the tragedy was the
death of Mrs. Winters shortly after their first child was born. The child
is still alive, and but for its influence Winters left word he would have killed
himself four years ago.
About five years ago Winters married. At the end of a year his wife passed
away and since that time he has found solace only in the life of his baby
daughter which was spared him. He has been subject to spells of despondency,
but never gave any strong intimation that he was tired of his existence and
would seek to destroy it.
For the past three years he has been residing at the home of his father,
Charles Winters, a deputy in the Assessor's office. Yesterday afternoon the
father heard a shot and rushing to his son's room saw the young man stretch
ed upon the bed with a stream of blood flowing from his left breast. The pistol
with which the deed had been committed was still in his hand. When his
father entered he said. "Father. I should not have done this," and then lapsed
into unconsciousness, from which he never recovered. Dr. H. F. Wilson of 3765
Seventeenth street and Dr. J. H. Soper of 347 Xoe street were called, but they
could administer no relief, and the unfortunate man passed away at 6 o'clock
yesterday morning. The Morgue deputies were notified and an inquest will be
held.

to betray the people. Admitting them

man whose knowledge of police matters

scrupulous as the backers of Lieutenant

The plan to elect the Mayor's secretary.
Colonel William P. Sullivan Jr.. Chief of
Poiice will be part of such a plan. It is
not thought for a moment that Colonel
Sullivan would knowingly lend himself to
such a nefarious conspiracy. In fact, it
may be said that it was only after his
name was mentioned that the Esola plot
ters devised their plan to make the man
with the alias Chief of Detectives. Colonel
Sullivan is a stranger to police duty. He
knows nothing about It. and he knows he
knows nothing about it. So do Esola's
backers, and with this knowledge they
plan to unload on the department their
willing: creature, a man with a memory
po defective as to be absolutely painful.
They plan to use Colonel Sullivan as a
figurehead for the most piratical craft
that ever flew the black flag at the mast
head. They propose to put in Esola to so
manipulate the department that they, und
not the Chief of Police, will control the
criminal elements of the city, and every
body nan imagine, in the light of recent
desperate sorties and unblushing per
juries, what that means.
Will they make it? Not while two Com
missioners remain steadfast for a clean
Police Department; not while one voice
is left to cry out against the shameless
attempt. They will try it, however, and
it is the duty of those Commissioners to
be on the alert.
The Board of Police Commissioners will
meet this evening at 7:30 o'clock to con
sider candidates for head of the depart
ment. Until they have elected a man to
that office the conspirators will keep
Esola and their plans under cover.
SEPARATED BY DEATH;
JOINED BY SUICIDE
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 29, 1900.
ROW OVER A
WOMAN COSTS
ONE MAN'S LIFE
James Gleeson Shot
in the Heart.
TRYING TO STOP A FIGHT
SHOOTOTG OCCTTRRED IN STAN
LEY'S GROTTO, TURK STREET.
The Woman Was Quarreling With a
Companion, When Another Man
Interfered to Help
Her.
James O'Nell Gleeson, a bartender, was
shot and killed about midnight last night
In Stanley's Grotto, a resort located at
the corner of Market and Turk streets.
The murderer escaped and the detectives
are scouring the city in an effort to ap
prehend him. His identity is known, and
it Is believed that it will be only a ques
tion of a short time until he will be placed
behind the bars, as It is almost impossible
for him to leave the city.
Last night shortly before 12 o'clock a
woman named Minnie Hamilton, well
known in the tenderloin district, and a
companion entered box 7 of the gTOtto,
which is located in the basement of the
building. The woman's companion is sup
posed to be a friend of the proprietor of
the house. The couple remained in the
box for a few moments, during which
they ordered refreshments. A dispute
arose and the woman was heard to apply
vile epithets to her companion. She final
ly commenced to scream and rushed from
the room pursued by the man who had
entered with her.
The two passed through several hall
ways and ran into a parlor In the place in
which several persons were seated. The
woman begged for assistance, and a man
who is known as her constant companion
and protector jumped from his seat and
turned upon the newcomer in the room.
A struggle ensued and lasted for a few
seconds, when the bartender of the place,
James Gleeson, better known as "Nealy,"
attempted to separate the combatants.
The affair then became three-handed, and
after a few moments more the Hamilton
woman's friend, who had interfered in her
behalf, darted out of the door into a hall
way. He was followed by the two men
and turning short on them, at the same
time drawing a revolver, said:
"Stand back or I'll shoot."
Almost simultaneously with the warning
a shot rang out and the bartender dropped
to the floor. A bullet had struck him di
rectly in the center of the breast and had
reached his heart.
The murderer then made a daring and
successful attempt to escape. He dashed
hatless up a winding stairs which leads
to th Turk-street entrance of the place
while bystanders and witnesses to the
tragedy were too surprised and dum
founded to interfere. When they reached
the street a short time afterward no trace
could be found of the man.
Among those who were present In the
room were two musicians. Both agree
upon the particulars of the affray, but
claim they did not see the actual shoot
ing.
After the murderer had become a fugi
tive the woman who caused the trouble
and her companion who occupied the box
with her left the place before the police,
who were attracted by the shot, could ap
pear on the scene. The ambulance was
hastily summoned and the Injured man
was started on a journey to the Receiving
Hospital. Before the wagon had reached
Its destination, however, he was dead, and
his body waa later removed to the
Morpue.
Officers Joy, Ring and Harrigan and
Sergeant Sha" were detailed on the case.
The Hamilton woman resides somewhere
on Mission street, and the first step
taken was to locate her. A description of
the man who committed the crime was
furnished the officers, and they expect to
effect his capture in a short time. Glee
eon, the murdered man, was about 26
years of age and was a brother-in-law of
Stanley, the proprietor of the resort.
