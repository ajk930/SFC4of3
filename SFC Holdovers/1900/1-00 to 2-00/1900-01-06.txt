THE BATTLE OF BELMONT
deemed necessary or advisable to
make an attack. That a general
battle, raging over some twenty
miles of country, should take
place is not likely. A series of
engagements should follow, one
after another, the British doing
their best to seize upon Ihnlawe
and Springfield/ so as to cover
further maneuvering against se
lected spots in the Boer line of
intrenchments.
It is difficult to follow the
fighting around Colesberg. As
General French's forces are al
most surrounding Colesberg, his
right and left are different, ac
cording as they are looked at
from north or south. It may be
assumed the Boers would be like
ly to make a movement to clear
this communication with the
Free State to the north and east,
and would send a force north
ward. Without a definite â¢ de
scription of the positions of the
units of French's forces it is im
possible to ascertain exactly the
various moves in this contest be
tween forces of equal mobility.
The arrival of the household
cavalry, field artillery and a bat
talion of the Essex regiment,
which have been sent to General
French, should be sufficient to
force the Boers to evacuate
Colesberg.
The fighting at Moiteno is in
structive in several respects. The
Boers can obviously cling to their
positions with obstinate tenacity
and are not to be driven out ex
cept by patient and scientific gen
eralship, but when they attempt
ed a counter attack they failed.
This has been the case through
the war. Had the British force
possessed cavalry the Boers
might have suffered. As it is,
cavalry or more mounted infan- ;
try are needed at every point by
Methuen, Gatacre and Buller.

TON. Jan. sâ lf the French Gov

likely to become an object of concern to
two or three powers, including the United
States. The syndicate whlcn finances the

the*e several Governments will anxiously

formally recognized the Jimines Govern

sured that the new Government would
assume the obUgaOcmi of the Heureaux

mentioned aa coming within this assur

mean protection of the syndicate's rights
as welJ as payment of the remainder of
the Ozaraa bridge claim, which was de

The authorities understand that a
Frcr.ch man-of-war is at Santo Domingo.
The gunboat Machias has also been in the

thize with France, having had experience
In the collection of claims from South
American Governments.
I was told at the State Department to
day that M. Thiebault. French charge
d'affaires, had made no representations in
this matter to the State Department. The
Jimints Government, according to official
information received here, has repudiated
j-aper money issued by former President
Heureaux and the National Bank. Natu
rally foreign interests have been seriously
Injured by this proceeding, especially
American citizens, who are the principal
holders cf the money.
Representatives of several powers in
Santo Domingo have made protests
against this action, but they have been
unavailing. In view of thlÂ« fact and the
further failure of the Jimines Government
to continue to r^>* Installments of the
Boisemare-Caecavelll claim France has
probably come to the conclusion that In

the report that she has sent instructions

In view of the reeling in Santo Domingo
acainet the action of the French Consul in
preEFlngtheÃoisemare-Caccavelli claim of
TSO.OOO irancs. the following statement of
the French position is given from a source
whose accuracy of Information is unde
niable:
"In accordance with the treaty conclud
ed in ISSS between President Heureaux
ar.d the French Minister to Haytl the
Government of Santo Domingo agreed to
turn ever to the French Consul a monthly
indemnity in reparation for services ren
dered and damages sustained by families
of French citizens who had been assassi
nated. In default of payment the treaty
stipulated that action might be taken
against the improvement company having
the concession to collect the revenues of
the island. Since the assassination of
Presid'-nt Heureaux the Indemnity has
been withheld, but on account of the dis
turbances following his death France
made no immediate demand for payment.
As more than Fix months has passed
without action, and Santo Domingo show
ing bad faith in the execution of the obli
gations, the French Consul, in conformity
with the tfeatyj received an order to place
an embargo on the revenues of the im
provement company. The execution of
this ordt-r provoked disturbances which
the Government of Santo Domingo has
r.ot attempted to suppress and serious in

"At, dawn to-day Colonel Baden-Powell
organized an unsuccessful attack upon a
strong position of the enemy at Gametree,
two miles from, Mafeking, from which the
Boers have been maintaining a desultory
but annoying: shell and rifle fire for sev
eral weeks. The railway has recently
been reconstructed between the town and
Gametree, where the Boers had de-
cember 26 shows that Colonel
Baden-Powell suffered consider

seems to have been pushed right
up to the earthworks, and then
to have been of necessity aban

APPEAL FOR AID TO
EQUIP A HOSPITAL
LONDON. Jan. 6.â The Duchess of
Marlborough, the Countess of Essex.
I^ady Georgiana Curzon. Madame Van
Ar.dree and the members of the Impe
rial Yeomanry hospital furd appeal
through the Associated Press to the
people of the United States and Canada
In behalf of their efforts to equip and
maintain a hospital with a base at Cape
Town. The Duchess of Marlborough eaid
to-day:
"The Duke of Marlborough Is certainly
going to South Africa at the earliest op
portunity, although his appointment Is
r.ot yet announced. We are all naturally
much interested In the war and especially
in the success of the Imperial Yeomanry.
Th* hospital scheme has the sanction of
Lord Lar.sdowne and Lord Wantage. We
have already secured Â£10,000 and need
Â£30,000 to provide ISO beds for the dura
tion of the war. It has occurred to the
ladies of the committee that we may
properly count on the assistance of the
American and Canadian people In our ef
forts to establish a hospital at Cape
Town, and as the matter has not been
presented to them we believe they only
need to know our wants to grant us gen
erous aid."
Lady Essex (formerly Miss Adele Beech
Grant of New York) said to-night:
"It only needs Â£5 to equip and maintain
a bed In the hospital. Each individual,
city or corporation sending such amount
will have a bed named in his honor. This
forms a definite, tangible object for con
tributions and we can assure the people of
America that every dollar contrbuted will
reach the object the donor desires. Cer
tainly, then, scores of American and Ca
nadian citizens will be clad to have a
hospital bed named for them by contrib
uting such a sum. We trust this appeal
will meet with the hearty approval of the
American people."
The Duke of Marlborough Is In town ar
ranging for his departure for South Afri
ca. He takes with him four horses, four
raules ar.d a N'oval cart.
RETURNS WITH FUGITIVES.
BELMONT, Cape Colony, Jan. s.âColo
nel Pilcher's column, with the Douglass
refugees, returned to camp this morning.
LONDON, Jan. 6.â The ap
parent breaking of the
calm on the Tugela River,
where Buller faces Joubert, the
immobility at Modeler River,
where Cronje blocks Methuen's
advance, the activity at other
centers of war is the general as
pect this morning of the situation
in South" Africa. Those who con
trol the transmission of news
from the Cape have allowed al
most minute knowledge of Colo
nel Pilcher's raid up to Douglas,
General French's engagement
around Colesberg and General
Gatacre's repulsion of the attack
on Moiteno, to reach London.
These engagements all resulted
more or less favorably to the
British arms, which explains their
prompt transmission.
From the Tugela River, how
ever, come dispatches which give
evidence of having been rigidly
censored. Of course, it is a
measure of prudence that no ink
ling of the movements which
General Buller intends to make
against the foe should reach the
ears of General Joubert, but as
the Boers have hitherto been ex
ceptionally well served by their
intelligence department, it seems
doubtful whether the dispatches
couli tell them anything which
they do not know already.
Within a few days 7000 addi
tional troops will be landed in
Natal, but whether it is possible
to wait for them or whether Gen
eral Buller's hands may be forced
by increasing the difficulties un
der which Ladysmith labors, it is
impossible to say. Meanwhile
extended reconnoissances are the
order of the day on the Tugela,
to discover the presence and posi
tion of Boer batteries. Wherever
there are indications of the ene
my's strength the naval guns are
brought into play.
General Buller is now strong
enough to advance should it be

BRITONS WERE
DRIVEN BACK
Baden-Powell's Force Sustained
'Heavy .Loss in th>e AttacK
on a Boer Fort.
LONDON, Jan. s.â The War Office has received . through General
Forestier- Walker at Cape Town the following dispatch from Colonel
Baden-Powell, dated Mafeking, December 26:
"We attacked one of the enemy's works this morning, endeavor
ing to push back the cordon northward. Our force consisted of three
guns, two squadrons of the Protectorate Begiment,' one of the Bechun
naland â¢Rifles', armored train, etc. The enemy had strengthened their
works during the night and doubled the garrison since yesterday's re
connaissance.
â¢'Nevertheless, our attack was carried out and pressed home with
the greatest possible gallantry and steadiness under a very heavy fire.
But all efforts to gain the interior by escalade failed, the fort, being
practically impregnable.
"Our attack only withdrew after six of our officers and a large
number of men had bean hit. Nothing could have exceeded the courage
,and dash displayed. \^> Â¦
"The general situation remains unchanged and the health and
spirits of the garrison are very satisfactory.
"I regret to report the following casualties:
I KILLED.
"Captain J. R. Vernon, Captain H. C. Sanfreid, Lieutenant H. C.
Paton, eighteen non-commissioned officers and troopers.
Â¦ WOUNDED.
"Captain Charles Fitzclarence, twenty-three non-commissioned
officers and troopers.
' PRISONERS.
"Three troopers."
General Forestier- Walker points out that while the dispatch gives
all the names, it fails to show that six officers were hit.
LONDON, Jan. 6, 5 a. m. â Rumors are current here this morning that General Buller has assumed the
offensive and has already started fighting on the Tugela and that he has been heavily shelling the
Boer intrenchments.
The reports are not confirmed. It is known that this shelling is a necessary preliminary to an at
tack, but it seems doubtful if a general movement by British forces has begun. That this reported fight
ing may be an attack on commandos which are on the south bank of the river is by no means unlikely.
These must be dislodged before the real attempt to force the passage of the river can be commenced.

CHICAGO, Jan. s.â Robert T. Lincoln and Norman B. Ream, executors of
the estate of George M. Pullman, were to-day alloted as compensation for
their services the sum of $425,000. The order was entered by Judge Batten
in the Probate Court.
This is said to be the largest amount In fees ever allowed executors of
any estate handled by the Probate Court here. The compeneatlon was agreed
upon with the approval of Mrs. Harriet Sanger Pullman, the widow, Mrs.
Frank O. Lowden and the other residuary legatees before the order of the
court wns asked.
Another order was made fixing the widow's award at CO.OOO. Under ordi
nary circumstances this award probably would not have been over half this
sum. but Mrs. Pullman, through her counsel, moved the court for the as
eignnaent named and was Joined in the request by her daughters, Mrs. Flor
ence Pullman Lowden and Mrs. Harriet Pullman Carolan, who represented
that It was the purpose of their mother to apply the whole amount of the
widow's award in the erection of a monument in Graceland Cemetery to the
memory of her late husband. It was declared in the petition that the two
daughters desired to participate In the erection of the monument and there
fore joined In the motion that the award be fixed at the amount named.
The final accounting of the executors in the Pullman estate is expected
to be made next week. It is said that the estate, which was listed at about
J5.000,000 when the will was probated, will now figure up to nearly $14,000,003.

"During the night the armored train,
with Maxim and Hotchkiss guns, under
Captain Williams and troops, took up po
sitions for attack from two sides. Cap
tain Lord Charles Bentinck and a squad
ron were in reserve upon the left, while
the extreme left wing was occupied by
artillery under Major Panzera and a gal
loping Maxim of the Cape Police, the
Â¦wricle being under Colonel Hore.
"Emplacements were thrown up during

rapidly drew the reply from the enemy,

eign Office, who was Interviewed this
evening, said that Great Britain had not
yet answered Germany's request for an
explanation of the seizure, but that the
reply was expected In the course of a few
days. The Foreign Office, according to
this official, has not yet concluded that
Great Britain Is trying to ride roughshod
over Germany.
The correspondent asked what position
Germany takes regarding England's right
to search German ships on the high seas.
The official answered that nothing could
be divulged at this stage of the negotia
tions, but he pointed out that the Bundes
rath was sailing for a Portuguese port.
On being asked what Germany would do
should it turn out that the Bundesrath
was carrying contraband he gave a non
committal reply, but conveyed the Im
pression that such a discovery would se
riously damage Germany's case.
The correspondent then asKed whether
Germany had taken steps to be represent
ed at Durban during the Investigation of
the cargo. To this inquiry an evasive an
swer was given, but the official Implied
that Ger: '.any would undoubtedly take
this course If the British report should be
adverse.

Â¦who saw him ar.d h-s brother officers
killed. Bctog without commanders they
were driven off at one point, but they
endeavored to scale the fort at others.
They found the pt>sition of the Boers,
however, almost Impregnable.
"When we retired under cover of the
armored train bo many men had been
wounded that a S'^spmsion of hostilities
occurred under the auspices of the Red
Cross. The veldt axousd the Boer posi
tion was at once dotted with flag* of
mercy and it was seen that our wounded
were featured within but a short radius
of the fort. We had almost completely
eurrour.ded it and had it not been bo ex
traordinarily we!', protected we should
have Ix-en in possession.
*"I wei:t w:ti> an ambulance to Game
tree. The fort Itself is circular, with a
wide Interior and a narrow frontage, be
tween six and seven feet high, pierced
with triple tiers of loopholes and sur
rounded by a ditch."
"I was permitted to assist in dressing
the wounds, a majority of which appear
ed to have been caused by explopive bul
lets, the point of entry being small, but
the area of injury covering a wide re
gion. While the wounded were being at
tended, number* of Boers left their \n
trenchments atd gathered around us. At
the conclusion of the dressing I spoke to
several tattrred and dirty but physically
fine wen. Many of them were undersized
and all wore beards. Ttiey referred me
to the field oornot. who denied the u*e
of explosive bullets. On being shown the
horrible wounds, he admitted that at one
time explosive bullets had been served
out, but he said he was certain they had
all been previously expended, and that
none could have been used on this occa
sion. He then produced a bandolier filled
with dumdums, and I pointed out that as
far as Mafcking was concerned these had
been recalled.
LAier on I called the attention of the
field comet to four of his own men who
were rifling dead bodies. He expressed
his regret to a British officer that, despite
his Instructions to respect the dead, the
younger Boers were unruly and beyond
his control, and he accused the British
eoldleT3 of stripping General Kock and
leaving him naked and wounded on the
field, thus indirectly causing his death."
The correspondent then describes a
pcene of angry recrimination between the
field comet and the Boers regarding the
existence of orders about robbing the
dead ar.d also about the facts themselves,
some of the Boers asserting that they
only took arms, dwpite the arrival at that
\ery moment of the bodies of five British,
under Boer escort, with the pockets of
their uniforms turned Inside out. He goes
on to say:
"Some of the British wounded flatly ac
cused the Boers of stealing their money,
rings and other valuables. We had great
difficulty In getting permission to use the
armored train to remove our wounded.
"We believe that spies carried the news of
our contemplated sortie to the Boers. The
field cornet admitted that he was rein
forced during the night by 100 mounted
men and acknowledged withdrawing his
guns."
ANTI-BRITISH FEELING
GROWS AMONG GERMANS
Referring to the rumor that the Swiss
Commission had decided to award dam
ages to Great Britain in the Delagoa Bay
arbitration, the Foreign official intimated
that such a decision might not mean that
England would secure Delagoa Bay, inas
much as France might advance to Portu
gal the money to pay the award and thus
England might be Phut off with no choice
but to acceDt the situation.
The Hanover Courier, confirming earlier
reports regarding the shipments of arms
and ammunition from Germany, asserts
that German rifles have been sent to the
Transva-l since the outbreak of the war.
It says: "We know from a trustworthy
source that 60,000 German rifles of the
newest and best construction have arrived
at Pretoria In good condition. They
reached Lourenzo Marquez by way of
China, having been deceptively packed
and declared as furniture, In which pianos
played the chief role."
The Lelpslc Neuste Nachrlchten asserts
upon what It calls reliable Information
that Hcrr Krupp Is making steel shells
for Great Britain at Essen. Another news
paper makes a similar statement, alleg
ing that 45,000 shrapnel shells are in prep
aration for lyddite filling.
The Berliner Tageblatt has a dispatch
from Papenburg, Hanover, the home of
Captain Muhlmann of the German bark
Hans Wagner of Hamburg, which was
seized by the British on Delagoa Bay on
December 21, saying that the bark had
powder and dynamite in her cargo.
The central committee of the German
Red Cross Society publishes a statement
that the second expedition for the Trans
vaal was not on the Bundesrath, but la
on the. Herzog, which should have arrived
at Lourenzo Marquez on January 2. Prom
inent members of the Colonial Society dis
claim having authorized the calls printed
in the Colonial Zeitung for Indignation
meetings to protest against Great Brit
ain's course. The Berlin and Charlotten

APPEAL OF
ROBERTS TO
THE HOUSE
Begins His Closing State
ment Before the Special
Committee.*
WASHINGTON. Jan. B.â The Roberts
investigating committee continued Its ses
sion to-day. Miss Roberts, the daughter
cf the Utah member-elect, sat near him.
Chairman Tayler said at the outset that
he had received from ex-Secretary John
G. Carlisle a letter giving his views on
the case. Carlisle eald he was suffering
from a cold and was unable to make an
oral argument at this time. As to the
case he said:
It seems to me that the question of dtizen
shlp has been abandoned, or at least nothing
Is *ald about It In the testimony. The record
of Roberts' application and admission to cltl
zennhlp does not comply with the law as I
understand it, and I do not think he will be
allowed to vote in any State upon a certificate
based on that record. The resolution under
which the commission is proceeding directs it
to ascertain and report not only upon Roberts'
prlma facie right, but upon his general right.
This Carlisle discussed on the evidence
and concluded:
He is at this very moment a polygamist, not
having at any time abandoned or renounced
the relation assumed by the plural marriages,
and cohabitation with the alleged wives is not
at all necessary. The question, therefore, Is
whether the committee will decide on the
question of final right that an undoubted
polygamist who Justifies the doctrine and prac
tices of polygamy shall be allowed to hold a
seat In the House.
It was determined by the committee to
ask Carlisle for his views more at length
on the general right of Congress to ex
clude a member.
Roberts then began his argument. He
read a typewritten statement reviewing
In detail the proceedings of his case up
to date. It said in part:
The questions to be considered are the prlma
facie and nnal right of B. H. Roberts, Rep
resentative-elect from > Utah, to a seat In the
House of Representatives, to which he was
elected in the month of November. IS9B, by the
people of Utah; the electorate of said State
gave him a plurality vote of 5665. It Is a case
In which there is no contest and where It ap
pears, so far as the proceeding* before the
committee are concerned, the Representative
elect possesses all of the qualifications pre
scribed by the constitution of the United States
and where there Is no statute, bo far as made
to appear before the committee, either In the
State of Utah or the United States, applicable
to the case, which disqualifies the Represen
tative-elect from the ofHce of Congressman In
the lower house of the American Congress.
Roberts dwelt with especial emphasis on
the right of a constituency to determine
upon the moral character of a member.
He Bald:
It Is left to .those constituents to determln*
what shall be the moral status of the man
they wish to send to Congref* as their repre
sentative and not to the House of Congress.
In support of this he read with emphatic
and approving comment a Congressional
report signed Dy B. F. Butler, Daniel W.
Voorhees and others, in the course of
which it is said that the House of Rep
resentatives bball be composed of mem
bers chosen by the people of the States
and not by the Representatives of other
States "according to the notion of the
necessities of 'self-preservation and self
puriflcation' which might BUggest them
selves to the reason or caprice of mem
bers from other States In any process of
'purgation or purification.' "
Roberts declared that Utah, one of the
great silver-producing States, had been
denied representation of late,, while the
Important financial bill, vitally involving
Utah's silver mining and silver Industry,
was considered and passed.
' Roberts took up the evidence of the wit
nesses who appeared against him and was
questioning some of the statements when
Chairman Tayler interrupted:
"Mr. Roberts, if you want to testify you
ought to go on the witness stand."
This developed some difference of opin
ion among the members of the committee.
DeArmond and Littlefleld said the state
ments were in the line of legitimate argu
ment. Tayler insisted that Roberts should
not be permitted to make statements of
fact while not under oath and not Bubject
to the rule of perjury. DeArmond an
swered that the hearing had wide latitude
and he was sure the committee could dis
criminate between Roberts' arguments
and his statements of fact.
"I am not in such a state of mental dis
turbance," remarked DeArmond, "as to be
able to foresee what Roberts is going to
say."
He added that he did not see that the
interruption of the chairman was at all
called- for in view of the latitude hereto
fore allowed.
The incident took an amusing turn when
Roberts, being allowed to proceed, said
he was through on that subject and there
was a hearty laugh all around. He went
on, however, analyzing the evidence of
other witnesses and in general question-
Ing the directness and conclusiveness of
the testimony. Said he:
It has not even been established that B. H.
Roberts was ever married to Margaret C.
Bhlpp-Roberts. It had been shown that he was
neen near the horse and once In , the houaa,
but there was no testimony of marriage, noth
ing as to their maintaining marital relations,
nothing as to their having been seen at the
theater or at the church or otherwise associat
ing as man and wife.
Taylerâ How do you account for your picture
being- found In her house?
Robertsâ l don't know how to account for It.
As to the testimony that he had attend
ed the funeral of a child of Celia Dibble
Roberts, that was. Roberts said, not re
markable. There was nothing extraordi
nary in his attending a funeral and the
inferences drawn could not be viewed as
proof As to any direct marital relations
with Celia Dibble Roberts, he said, there
was no direct testimony. In the main the
evidence was as to general repute, he con
tended, which was short of that conclu
sive proof required. He challenged the
charge that he had contracted three po
lygamous marriages.
Tayler said he had never heard of such
a charge, as three polygamous marriages
would mean four marriages in all.
"I challenge this," said Roberta, "be
cause it is one of the charges on which
excitement has been worked up."
When Roberts sought to read published
comment tending to show the motive of
the "crusade" and "cause" against him
Chairman Tayler stopped him. The com
mittee had nothing to do with nny cru
sade, Tayler said, but was trying to as
certain one fact, namely, whether Roberts
was a polygamist. The chairman eald
Roberts' line of procedure was irregular.
There was some difference of opinion in
the committee as to the course to pursue.
"Let us settle It here and now." said
Mr. Llttlefield. "As far as I am con
cerned, I am ready to hear anything he
wants to say."
Tayler said he wished to enter his pro
test against bringing questions of fact
Into the argument aÂ« both improper and
ridiculous.
Roberts vehemently exclaimed against
those who had "hounded" him. . They
were not the bankers, merchants, lawyers
and other substantial citizens of Utah,
but they were In the main Eastern mis
sionaries who had gone to Utah to oppose
Mormonism.
At one point Representative McPherson
of the committee asked: "Under l your
faith, was the taking of plural wives
merely allowable or was it required."
"It was mandatory," replied Roberts,
"according to the view of leading Mormon
authorities." ? .-., Â¦..--
Roberts continued until 4:30 p. m., when
he asked that the hearing go over, having
spoken almost five hours. The committee
thereupon adjourned until 10 a. m. to-mor
row, when Mr. Roberts will conclude.
Mexico Grants a Request.

State Department at the instance of the

at some length and then, taking up tho
subject of imperialism, said:

eminently successful as a persuader. He will

BRYAN ADDRESSES
TRAVELING MEN
Speaks on Coinage and
Expansion.
LINCOLN, Jan. s.â The fourth annual
banquet of the Nebraska Traveling Men's
Bryan Club was held to-night at the Lin- ,
coin Hotel, following the meeting of the
Stato central committees of the Demo
crats, Populists and Free Silver Republi
cans. Nearly two hundred traveling 1 men
and their guests were seated at the tables.
Colonel Bryan's address was the feature.
He complimented the club on the Increas
ing importance of its banquets and praised
the members for their political seal.
Touching on national topics, he said In
part: j
We are now near enough to the national con
vention'to feel assured that there will, be no
considerable opposition to the reafflrmatlon of
the Chicago platform. The late elections de
stroyed the last hope of those who sought to
modify or subtract from the creed enunciated
at Chicago In 1596. The Republican party has
been driven under the lash of the financiers to
the open espousal of the gold standard, and,
spurred on by the national bank corporations,
it has avowed Its purpose to drive the green
backs out of circulation and substitute a bank
note Issued and controlled by the national
banks. The Democratic party still contends
for the restoration of bimetallism at the ratio
of 16 to 1, the only ratio advocated by those
who believe In the double standard. It also
contends for the greenback as against the bank
note.
â¢ The members of this club were opposed to the
money trust in 1896, and they are not surprised
that the vicious trust principle has been ex
tended to IndUÃtrlal combinations, which have
in three years thrown out of employment largo

Santa Clara County Refuses to Pay
for Duplicate John Doe
Warrants.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. s.â The rich harvest en-
Joyed for years by Justices of the Peice
and Constables in this city and county for
the issuance of John Doe warrants was
abruptly ended to-day by the Board of
Supervisors, which passed a motion de
claring that no more fees for this clnsa
of warrants would be allowed. During the
past couple of years the work of township
officials has become notorious, and the
last Grand Jury considered the matter
and recommended that it be stopped.
This is mostly practiced in Chinese
cases. On some days thirty or forty John
Doe warrants would be issued In the
courts of Justices ' Wallace and Rosenthal
of this city, and the same identical
charges made in the courts of Justices
Hirsh and Herrington of Santa Clara. In
this way hundreds of dollars were ex
tracted from the county treasury. The
Constables shared equally as well. Now
the Supervisors have concluded this Is too
good a thing, and have shut It off.
WILL DECLARE A DIVIDEND.
Directors of the Defunct Union Sav
ings Bank Meet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. s.â At a meeting of the
directors of the defunct Union Savings
Bank to-day an attempt was made by the
depositors to have a dividend of S per
cent declared on accounts. The directors
declined to act, however, but stated that
a 10 per cent dividend on deposits would
probably be declared next month.
The bank building will probably be sold
to the Commercial Savings Bank for $83
toO, and President Rea declares that if
this is done an additional dividend of o per
cent wllj be paid. Of J55.000 received for
the sale 160,000 will go to Mrs. Myra E
Wright, who holds a mortgage for that
amount on the building. To-morrow a big
meeting of depositors who have not yet
sued will be held to receive a report of
how many of the stockholders are willing
to pay up the $70 per share assessment
levied, and to decide on future action.

BURNS ENLISTS CITRUS GROWERS.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5.â A letter that has been Issued by the Citrus Growers*
tariff executive committee Is construed by local politicians to mean the capture
of that committee by the friends of Dan Burns, and that the committee Is being
used as a catspaw In his Interests. While this Is denied by the committee, the
fact Is established that at this Juncture no cause for the Issuance of the letter
exists. Aside from this political aspect, those who have been battling for the
defeat of the Jamaican treaty that proposes a reduction of 20 per cent In the
tariff on citrus fruit from the British West Indies are firmly of the opinion that
the tenor of the letter weakens their cause and gives strength to the opposition.
An authentic copy of the letter, which Is dated December 29, is in the following
language:
-To His Excellency. Henry T. Gose, Sacramento. Cal. : The ratification of the reciprocity
treaty between this country and the British "West Indies, which la now pending Jn the
United States Senate, is a serious menace to the Industries of California, and more par
ticularly to the citrus Industry, In which we. your petitioners, have large Investments of
capital and In many Instances our all. The gentlemen composing the Citrus Tariff Com
mttt** of California are doing all In their power to protect our Interests, but are disheart
ened by the report of their representative In Washington that his efforts and those of our
Senator and Representatives In Congress are In a great measure negatived by the absence
of our legal representation In the United States Senate, the friends of the measure Insist
ing that If our Interests were In peril so Important an office, and one that would
have such weight Jn deciding the fate of the treaty, should be at one* filled. Serious ques
tions are sometimes settled by one vote and no risk should be taken that a treaty so
Inimical to the Interests of this State may be ratified by so slender a majority. We, there
fore, as citrus fruit mowers, petition your Excellency to convene an extra session' of the
Legislature of this State at the earliest practicable date for the purpose of electing a United
States Senator.
SENATE COMMITTEE
DECIDES AGAINST QUAY
Resolution Declaring Him Entitled to a
Seat Is Defeated by a Vote of
Five to Four.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL,
WASHINGTON, Jan. s.â As anticipated in The Call's
dispatches the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions has decided against Quay by a vote of 5. t0 4.
While this does not settle the contest, which is yet to be
fought out on the floor of the Senate, it is regarded as a black
eye for Quay and his friends are greatly discouraged. Senator
Penrose and the henchmen of the Pennsylvania Senator, are
bitter against John Wanamaker and charge that he has made
an underhanded fight against Quay by dragging in the name
of Burns of California. A Pennsylvania Congressman said to
The Call correspondent to-night:
"The Burns and Quay cases are separate and distinct. Mr.
Quay should not be made to suffer merely because California's
Governor has announced his intention to appoint an unworthy
man as Senator from that State. The two cases are not on the
same plane. Mr. Quay has a clean record and is highly re
spected by Senators. -
"Each case should be considered on its individual merits.
If the Senators do this I am confident Quay will be seated, but
if Burns' name is allowed to drag Mr. Quay to defeat it will be
an outrage for which John Wanamaker will be held responsible
by Mr. Quay's friends and supporters."
, Those voting against Mr. Quay to-day were Messrs. Bur
rows, Caffery, Pettus and Harris. Those voting in favor of the
resolution for seating were Messrs. Chandler, Hoar and Mc-
Comas. Of the absentees Senator Turley was paired against Mr.
Quay and Mr. Pritchard for him.
The moral effect of an adverse report from the commit
tee, Mr. Quay's opponents believe, will be felt among new Sen
ators, who have been waiting to hear the views of their older
colleagues before committing themselves. With this adverse re
port from the committee, apathy among Republican leaders and
the anti-Quay organs increasing in bitterness and numbers, Mr.
Quay undoubtedly has a hard fight before him. That neither side
is yet confident is shown by the tendency of both to delay press
ing the case to a vote. A few days ago Mr. Quay's friends
were planning to secure a test vote by pressing the case for
consideration in lieu of the financial bill. To-day it is announced
that Senator Penrose will not antagonize the financial bill, but
will allow the Quay case to drift along until those in charge of
the financial bill are willing to let it come up. The opposition
also is pursuing a drifting policy.
Although the committee decided upon adverse action to
day there will be no hurry in submitting the report. Senator
Burrows, who will prepare a majority report, says that probably
two or three weeks will elapse before he will have time to com
plete it, and Senator Hoar, who is preparing the minority re
port, will, of course, have to wait until the majority report is
submitted to the full committee. All of this means that neither
side is confident at the present time and that the case will not
be brought up in the Senate until it is definitely known before
hand what the result will be.
CONTESTS FOR THREE SEATS IN CONGRESS.

THE CASE
OF CLARK
Senate Committee on Eleo

Arguments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. s.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Election* to
day began Its Investigation of the
charges of bribery made in connection
with the election of Senator Clark of
Montana. The proceedings were begun
by arguments from counsel on both sides.
Clark himself was present with his coun
sel, former Senator Faulkner.
Ex-Senator Edmunds appeared as lead
ing counsel for the complainants, making
the first statement in support of the me
morial presented against Clark. Ho said
the complainants expected to be able to
prove all the charges made and to show
that Clark's election was obtained by tho
liberal use of money, and that large sums
of money were furnished to this end by
Clark. He believed that the expenditures
could be traced to Clark with due effort
on tho part of the committee. He said ie
and his associates would ask to have a
good many witnesses summoned. Ed
munds said that the complainants expect
ed to prove all the charges made, and In
doing so would enter thoroughly into the
Whlteslde libel case, showing that when
Senator Clark had an opportunity to ap
pear in court he refused to answer any
material questions.
While Edmunds was making his state
ment a question arose concerning the ad
missibllity of testimony taken by the
Grand Jury of Lewis and Clark County.
McComas took occasion to Intimate that
he would hesitate to admit statements
purporting to violate the secrecy of a
Grand Jury room. Replying, Edmunds
said the notes on the Grand Jury proceed
ing had been made by Attorney General
Nolan and had been presented and read
by the Montana court in the disbarment
proceedings against John B. Wellcom*.
Hoar suggested that the testimony
should be admitted for the time and its
relevancy determined upon the final de
cision of the case. This brought out a
spirited protest by Rogers Foster of New
"iork, who appeared as one of the counsel
for Clark. He urged that such a course
was contrary to the precedents of the
committee; that Nolan was personally an
tagonistic to Clark, and at best the testi
mony was ex parte. Such a document was
no more evidence than an indictment
would be. Clark was not expected to de
fend his character but his right to a seat
in the Senate. Referring to the Montana
Supreme Court, he said there was politics
there as well as elsewhere in the State.
He insisted that Clark should have a
right to face and cross-examine all wit
nesses.
Ex-Senator Faulkner made the formal
statement on behalf of Clark. lie re
viewed the politics of Montana referring
to the "Daiy gang and the Clark fac
tion" In the Democratic po.Â»tics of the
State. It was, he said, an acknowledged
fact that the opponents of Clark In the
State had determined to prevent his po
litical preferment regardless of all the
proprieties. It would be shown that not
withstanding that charges of bribery
were made against some fifty persons, in
cluding thirty-eight members of the Leg
islature, there had been no proceedings
in any of the Montana courts against the
men thus involved. There was evidence,
that the present proceeding 1 was not sus
tained by public sentiment. â¢ Â¦
"The prosecution," said he. "was con
ceived In the -womb of personal malice,
rocked In the cradle of personal hate and
nourished upon corruption and jeal
ousy."
All the members of tho legislative
committee were opposed to Clark, he de
clared.
Outlining the defense, Faulkner said It
would show that the proceedings against
Clark had really had their origin In the
Senatorial contest In 1533, when the Idea
of springing a pretended exposure *.i
Clark upon the Legislature was conceived
by the Daly faction, and that the leader
of the faction had turned prophet In De
cember. IS3S, and declared that If Clark
had showed his head something would
have been heard to drop, and that he
would have driven Clark out of the State.
Other points of the defense were out
lined and the statement was made that.
If necessary, each charge against the
Senator would be met "by direct and pos
itive proof of Its falsity."
After hearing these preliminary state
ments, the committee held an executive
session to decide upon the status of the
papers before It, but after considerable
discussion on the points adjourned with
out action. The hearing of testimony will
begin to-morrow.

MYSTERIOUS MEANS.
Numerous Witnesses Give Testimony
Connecting the Prisoner With
the Poisoning of Mrs.
Adams.
NEW YORK. Jan- s.â First on the wit
ness stand to-day at the trial of Roland
B. Mollneux was Paying Teller Gilbert
D. Sayres of the Shoe and Leather Bank,
Â¦who was being cross-examined by Mr.
Weeks when court adjourned last even-
Ing. He was. however, excused until this
afternoon on account of a pressure of
business at the bank.
Frank S. Hunt of Newark. N. J.. tailor,
who made the suit of clothes for Moll
neux. testified that the cheat measurement
of the defendant was 37 Inches and that
bis waist measurement was S3 inches. The
evidence la considered significant because
of the fact that these measurements in
directly connect Mollneux with the writ
ing on the diagnosis black furnished by
the Marston Remedy Company, which
was signed "H. C. Burnett"
â¢ One of the most interesting witnesses
of the day was William W. Schaffier, a
manufacturer of cosmetics. He identlflea
the letter sent by Mollneux to Mrs. Schaf
fler informing her that he was to bemar
rled the next day. but that the marriage
was suddenâ that it was quite a romance,
in fact. This particular letter was ad
dressed "My dear Sadie " and on account
of the high social standing of Mrs. Schaf
fier and the fact that the District Attor
ney's office obtained possession of the cor
respondence in a fashion most mysterious
the Incident has attracted considerable
a M e Â£ t Sc r haffler said that he and his wife
had known Mollneux for four or five
years; that Mollneux had taken tea at his
house and that he was friendly with the
defendant. Nothing was elicited that
would have a tendency toth.ow any light
upon the manner In which the D lst zJct
Attorney obtained possession of the let
ters belonging to the wife of the witness.
Letters From* Molineux to Schaffler were
placed in evidence and identified by the
witness. Mr. Schaffler explained the sen
tence. "Cornish is in and lam out. which
appears in one of the letters, as meaning
that the defendant had resigned from the
Knickerbocker Athletic CluV while Cor
nish still remained there In an official
"Boward A. Adams, son of the late Mrs.
Adams, testified in detail concerning tho
incidents which occurred at the Adams
home on the day of the murder. He as
sened emphatically that his â¢ther did
not drink and explained that he had been
?n Connecticut during 1838. recovering
f?om injuries sustained by being caught
in a flywheel. He did not return to the
, Adams y lpartments until the day of the
murder, and consequent y knew nothing
concerning the incidents leading up to the
"one'of the most important witnesses
was Charles D. Allen. Mollneux's private
Secretary "it was Allen who signed let
tlrltol^Mollneux "per C. D. A." He had
studied chemistry and had served in the
laboratory of Molineux. Asked if there
were (many poisons in the laboratory he
replied: â . â
"Yes; barrels of them. _
Among the poisons which he mentioned
specifically were parts green, chrome yel
low English vermillion. dry arsenic m
ketts and Quantities of mercury. Allen
identified a letter w-hlch he wrote to the
Studio Publishing Company. 1620 Broad
way New York City, signed "Roland B.
Mdllneux per C. D. A.," as one that -he
wrote personally. He claimed that Moli
neux was looking for the names of con
sumers of dry colors. The letter was
wrutel according to Instructions to the
ordinary course of business, but the sig
nificance of the incident lies in the fact
that 1620 Broadway is the address of the
Koch Letter Box Agency, and it 13
Maimed that it was from this letter that
i Koch learned the address of Mollneux anil
' sent the defendant a circular offering to
I lease a private letter boxâ an offer which
it is claimed Molineux afterward accept
ed The witness would not swear, how
ever that Molineux ever saw the letter to
the Studio Publishing Company, but he
did testify that he saw a copy of the mag
azine sent for on the desk of Mollneux
subsequent to the opening of the corre-
SP Herbert e "K. Twitchell. loan clerk at the
Chase National Bank and a practical
handwriting expert, in response to ques
tions testified that in hi 9 opinion the ad
dress on the poison package was written
by Molineux. David C. Decker, paying
teller of the Union Square Bank, enter
tained a similar opinion. The handwriting
expert testimony of the day was conclud
ed when Paying Teller Sayers of the Shoe
and Leather National Bank again ap
peared on the stand and was cross-exam
ined by Mr. Weeks, a cross-examination
which, however, failed to shake his belief
in the guilt of Molineux. The last witness
of the day was Lewis H. Cornish, a cousin
of Harry S. Cornish, also a cousin of
Mrs. Florence Rogers, the daughter of the
dead woman. He testified that Harry
Cornish was ill when he called upon the
witness to inform him of the death of
Mrs. Adams, and upon cross-examination
by Mr. Weeks the witness admitted that
Mrs. Adams became ill while he was pay
ing a visit to her house about two weeks
before her death. The witness had cor
cluded his testimony upon this point when
court adjourned until Monday. â¢: : , ,-\,

THE LATE DAVID E. KNIGHT.
MARYSVILLE, Jan. 5.â David E. Knight, a well known pioneer and capi
talist of this city, expired euddenly at his home on B street at 4:10
o'clock this morning. Heart disease, for which he was under treatment
of the family physician for about two years, was the cause of his death.
The final illness was of about twenty minutes' duration. A servant
was attracted to Mr. Knight's sleeping apartments by strang# sounds emanat
ing therefrrm, and when admission was gained there were symptoms of choking
and smothering. A physician was Fummoned, but before aid arrived the life
p;->ark v.as gone. Before he passed away Mr. Knight gave his wife and others
in the room to understand that he realized the end had come.
David Edgar Knight was born In Tunbridge. Orange County, Vermont, Octo

NAVAL TESTS OF
MARCONI SYSTEM
Experiment Stations Are
Asked for.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, "WELLING-
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â
Rear Admiral Bradford, chief of the Bu
reau of Equipment, has again called .the
attention of Secretary Long to the desira
bility of conducting naval experiments
with wireless telegraphy. There Is a dis
position in the Secretary's office to await
the conclusion of the investigation now
being made by the Lighthouse Board. Ad
miral Bradford upon investigation learned
that the board had submitted an estimate
to Congress for $25,000 for erecting sta
tions at points on the coast and outlying
lighthouses, but the estimate contained no
provision for experiments. In view of this
fact he has asked the department to again
take the matter of naval experimentation
with the system under consideration.
The importance of the system to the
navy is very great, naval officers declare,
and It is hoped by them that the Secre
tary will deem it advisable to transmit an
estimate for J20.000 to Congress with a
view to Its Insertion in the naval bill.
Reports from South Africa Indicate that
on account of iron ore in the mountains
considerable difficulty Is being experienced
in communicating with the Marconi sys
tem. It Is thought by naval officers that
there will be no difficulty at sea, but army
authorities deeply deplore the effect of
iron in the earth on the system, and they
hope that something will be developed to
abolish this interference to successful
communication.

WANDY REFUSES
TO STAY AWAY
Marin Authorities Can
not Get Rid of Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. s.â Wesson Wandy.
the "hoodoo" of San Ra*aÂ«l Jail, is evi
dently of the opinion that stone walls do
not make a prison. This morning he was
given a pass out of the county, his lat
Â«st term having expired. To-nlpht the
authorities received word that he is mak
ing his way back to Ban Rafa?! with all
speed. This is the second tlrr.e he has
been %>hipped out of the county and re
turned. Two weeks before Thanksgiving
day Wandy was held for vagrancy. Dur
ing his term he tore up the steam plpei in
the bathroom and was nearly suffocated.
At the expiration of his sentence the
Constable escorted him to Sausallto and
gave him a pass to San Francisco? The
next heard of him was on Thanksgiving
dai- when he went into a restaurant here
and started to make a "rough house" be
cause he was asked to pay in advance
He was then sentenced to sixty days
During his last Incarceration he nearly
killed his cellmate. Twice he tore out
the steampipes, nearly cooking himself
and attempted to fire the Jail by burning
hiw blankets. To-day h* was turned loose
and a deputation of officers accompanied
him to the train.
Two hours later their joy was turned to
w*>epin>r by the news that Wandy had
been seen on the home trail. To-nlÃht
Constable Agnew is on the lookout for
him and the authorities wear a harried
look. They fear he will cause fresh
trouble if not recaptured. If he returns
an effort will be made to have him com
mitted to an insane asylum, as he is
either mad or too mischievous to be at
large.

Hammond, former surgeon general of the
army, died here to-night. Dr. Hammond
conducted a sanitarium here for some
years. He had a notable and somewhat
checkered career. He was on the retired
list at the time of his death. He at one
time -lost his position In the army, but
was restored after a hard fight.
William Alexander Hammond was born
at Annapolis. Md., on August 28, 182S;
graduated as M. D. at the New York Uni
versity in 1843 and entered the United
States army as assistant surgeon In 1849.
He remained in the army until October.
1860, when' he resigned and accepted the
appointment of professor of anatomy and
physiology in the University of Maryland
at Baltimore, where he also obtained a
large practice.
At the outbreak of the Civil War he
offered his services to the Government
and was reappolnted assistant surgeon in
May, 1861. On the reorganization of the
medical department in 1562 he was ap
pointed surgeon general of the army, in
which capacity he displayed great energy
and ability.
After two years of eminent service he
was accused of irregularities In awarding
contracts, tried by court-martial and dis
missed from office in 1864. He was
.subsequently vindicated and received
-ofneiar assurance that "a great wrong
Jiad been done" him.. Bearing this
unjust stigma, but undismayed, he
entered upon the . practice of his
profession in New York. For a time
lie was in pecuniary straits and compelled
to. eke out an income with his pen. In
1878 a special bill authorized the President
to review the court-martial proceedings
resulting in his honorable restoration to
rank, and he was placed on the retired
list.
Dr. Hammond was professor of diseases
of the mind and nervous system in New
York City and Baltimore medical colleges
and was the author of many valuable
works on these subjects. Of late years
Dr. Hammond conducted the Hammond
Sanitarium in Washington. His daughter,
well known as the Marquise Clara
Lanza and as an author and Journalist,
was married to an Italian nobleman. His
son, Graeme M. Hammond. Is a practicing
physician in New York City.

BELIEVE BASSENDORFF
WAS MURDERED
Coroner Hoskell Says That There Is
Nothing to Support the The
ory of Foul Play.
TACOMA, Jan. 6.â Frank Bassendorff,
the returned Klondiker, who was found
lying In a small pool of water below the
bluff near the headquarters building last
Monday morning, was prominent in Gen
esee County, New York, and his friends
there are not ready to accept the accident
theory to account for his death. Local
attorneys have been retained to look after
the Interests of the family and friends.
Coroner Hoskell does not believe a mur
der theory possible. An autopsy was con
ducted on the body of Bassendorff and
the report of the physicians was that his
ribs had been broken in and one of his
legs dislocated. The Injury to his head
was not enough to cause death, and as no
water was found on his lungs the physi
cians and Coroner believe he could not
have been drowned.
The Coroner says the man appeared to
have been drinking and reports came to
the effect that he had been about the city
in various saloons. This, though, the
Coroner cannot confirm. He cannot find
that he was seen anywhere in Tacoma.
The two empty gold sacks, the Coroner
says, were found In his bundle of blankets
and not on his person.
Bassendorff had just returned from
Alaska and his memorandum books indi
cated he at one time had $1000, but there
was nothing on his person save an empty
pocketbook.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, Jan. 5. â A remarkable story develops from an attempted
murder in the mining camp of Chemung, a backwoods section that Is prac
tically isolated at this time of the year. News of the affair reached her*
to-day. The day before Christmas Ernest Carheart shot and probably fa
tally wounded Chris Manning. Manning is a mining operator and has been
developing some properties for a rouple of years. Last summer he sold out
for $30,000, received a large payment down and returned to tne camp late In
the fall to make some additional locations. The day before Christmas he
went into Chemung and entered a barber shop to have his heavy beard re
moved, it being his intention to go East. â¢ The barber. Carheart, who had
only been in the camp a short time, removed part of the beard. He then
went to the back of the shop, procured a revolver and. returning, shot the
man In his chair. Carheart tells his story as follows:
A number of years ago the two lived In Dresden. Me. Carheart married
and Manning alienated the affections of the wife and eloped with her. The
two men had not met since until the day of the tragedy.
Both had changed in appearance, and neither had heard of the other
being in that locality. As Carheart removed the beard he recognized the man
as Manning and remembered the voice. Without saying at word, he se
cured his revolver. "Chris Manning:. I'm going to kill you!" he shouted,
firing almost instantly. Manning rolled out of the chair and Carheart was
prevented from shooting him again.
When Manning was told Carheart's story, he denied he had run away
with Carheart's wife, saying she was Carheart's sweetheart. He said he
married the woman, who had died several years before In Nevada,
BURGLAR FOILED
BY GOOD LIQUOR
Lost His Way in His
Victim's House.
Special Dispatch to TnÂ» Call.
PASADENA, Jan. s.â Frank Carter en
tered the home of William Kilbourn. in
South Pasadena, on New Year's day while
the family was enjoying the Tournament
of Roses. Carter had intended to make
a haul of household effects and any loose
cash which he might find, but on arriv
ing inside the house he found that Mr.
Kilbourn kept a wine cellar. Here were
stored all the choice wines of years' sav
ing and they proved too much of a temp
tation to be resisted. It is improbable
that Carter even tried to resist. He fell
to with a will, and when he had got his
fill of wine he began to look about him
in a dazed sort of way for a means of ea-
cape.
The family might be returning home
from the floral carnival at any moment,
he knew. When he looked about him he
could not recall how he had got Into the
house. A queer swimming of the head,
which often follows the imbibing of liquor,
it is said, had taken hold of him. Some
how he tacked his way Into the pantry,
but there was no means of exit to the
street from here. When he looked at a
door the drunken burglar saw two doors,
and when he reached for a knob there
was no knob there. It was a strange sit
uation to be in â one which many a man
has found unpleasant even though he was
Inside his own house.
The burglar saw a butcher knife, and
quickly seizing it began cutting: at the
panel of a near-by door. It was this grat
ing sound that met the ear of Mr. and
Mrs. Kllbourn when they arrived home
from the tournament. Mr. Kilbourn re
marked that .his wife had left the window
of the pantry open. "No. I didn t. re
plied Mrs. Kllbourn. Then they opened
the door and found the burglar there, cut
ting away for freedom. He had broken
two knives and was beginning on another.
They pounced on him. Mrs. Kllbourn be
ing all the more savage in her pounding
because the drunken burglar had upset a
pan of milk in his contortions and had
also trod a pie into the mesa.
At the preliminary hearing he pleaded
guilty, saying morosely, "Yes. I was there,
and that's all there Is to it." He was
found guilty of burglary and remanded
for trial before the Superior Court In Los
Angeles. '

SAX QUENTIN PRISON. Jan. s.â Go
See, the murderer of Qung Chung of Por
terville, to-day expiated his crime on the
scaffold.
The condemned man passed a restless
night, muttering what seemed to be pray
ers which his spiritual adviser, Father
Sullivan,' had taught him. At times he
would break out into railery and again
would seem to be transported back to the
days of his childhood and talk of his
mother and his life in the Flowery King
dom. The crucifix which Father Sullivan
had presented him with seemed to prove
a source of much consolation to him, and
early this morning he knelt In prayer be
fore the symnol of hope.
Before the final scene Father Egan vis
ited the cell and baptized the doomed con
vert. At 10:30 o'clock, the reading of the
death warrant being omitted. Execu
tioner Arbogast and Guard Beagly led the
condemned man forth and supported him
up the steps of the scaffold, for at the
last moment the sense of his doom over
came him, his knees gave way and he
broke Into loud sobs, calling again and
again on his mother. At 10:32 o'clock the
trap fell. Dr. Casey, the prison physi
cian, pronounced life extinct in eleven
minutes. There was no respiration after
the trap fell, v .
This* was the first hanging under War
den Agulrre's regime. Executioner Arbo
gast was visibly affected, but managed to
control his nerves until the end.
The crime for which Go See paid the
penalty was the murder of Qung Chung
at Porterville. The remains of the mur
dered man were found In the ruins after
a conflagration in the Chinese quarter
there, with a knife in the back. The
crime was traced to Go See and the guilt
being unmistakably brought home to him
he was condemned to death.
Go See had been in this country fifteen
years and conducted a laundry. He was
formerly a bookkeeper In China,

WHAT CARTOONIST WARREN SAW AT THE RINGSIDE.
MUDLARKS IN
DEMAND AT
TANFORAN
Three of the Choices Beaten.
Odd Run of Sto*m
King.
The threatening weather and a ragged
looking card attracted only a fair crowd
to Tanforan yesterday. There was noth
ing connected with the sport worthy of
especial mention, unless It were the defeat
of three favorites and another juicy plum,
handed to Corrigan's horse Geyser. The
public got fooled, thinking to see a great
contest between Bannockburn and Gey
eer, when, as a matter of fact, it Is said
the owner of the latter horse never had
an idea of starting him.
Storm King opened a 6 to 5 favorite for
the Introductory five and a half furlong
scramble, but for some unknown reason,
although the track was to his liking, his
price went back to 13 to 5. Several books
took great pleasure In laying against the
black horse, and he ran unplaced. Genua,
the post favorite, made all the running,
winning ridden out from Monda.
Barney Schreiber"s fast mare Miss
Marion ruled favorite over Loving Cup
for the live-furlong dash following, but
was beaten through an ill-judged ride.
Bullman, who had the mount, raced out
in front with the rank quitter Lady He
loise, besides losing fully four lengths by
a wide turn into the stretch. Jonea
brought Loving Cup up on the inside, ana,
catching the favorite all out, won by a
half-length in a mild drive. Juva secured
the show. '
The once mighty Vassal, from' Corri
gan's stable, started favorite for the milÂ©
selling run, finishing unplaced In a field
of "crabs." White Fern, with Jones up,
made all the running, and In the last few
yards won handily. Ping snatched tho
place from Racivan by a head. Faver
eham was also a starter.
With Bannockburn declining tho Issue,
the mile purse run went to Geyser. Cor
rigan's horse was a 1 to 6 favorite and
never had to be extended. Afamada
downed Bathos for place honors.
Jenkins seems to have no luck riding
Silver Tone. Tho Larzelere entry again
ruled favorite, but getting away poorly
could not finish better than third in the
run which followed. Maud Ferguson got
away first to a straggling start, leading
nearly to the wire, where Good Hope col
lared her and beat her out with ease. The
favorite, after ' being badly Interfered
with, ran into the show.
Starting a 4 to 5 favorite, Alico Dough
erty ran circles around her field in the
closing event, Vittitoe easing , the good
fiUv up at the end. Limerick led Choteau

PROMOTED ON
TWO FIELDS
D. R. McNeill Secures a Lease
of the Sixteenth-Street
Grounds.
The devotees of baseball will have their
choice of two leagues next year and the
old struggle of the survival of the fittest
will again be enacted. The directorate
of Mechanics' Institute yesterday leased
their fine grounds at Sixteenth and Fol
som streets to D. R. McNelll for a term
of years. Mr. McNeill has In the past
been the most successful promoter in this
city of big athletic events. He is a good
Judge of what the public will patronize
and always gives the best to be had.
The grounds will be available for all
manner of shows requiring big space in
their presentation. Under a new transfer
system they can be reached by all lines
crossing Sixteenth street and also Fill
more street. This makes them readily
accessible to all persons In the Western
Addition and also from the center of the
city. This was demonstrated by the ease
with which the crowds were carried to
the circus and to the big football games.
The threatened baseball war has not as
yet developed large proportions. The of
ficials of the league-promoting games at
Eighth and Harrison streets are prepar
ing for the season to come regardless of
the men who will use the Sixteenth street
grounds. Mr. McNeill haa not matured
his plans as yet. but his grounds will be
available for more than baseball.
MISS MORRISON ON
THE WITNESS STAND
Actress Declares She Was Goaded by
Continued Insults Into Killing
Leidenheimer.
CHATTANOOGA, Jan. 6.â The trial of
Julia' Morrison James for the murder of
Frank Leidenheimer, leading man in the
"Mr. Plaster of Paris" company, was re
sumed in the Circuit Court to-day. Jos
ephs, the electrician of the opera-house,
testified that Miss Morrison shot Leiden
heimer before he spoke and that Leiden
heimer made no effort to strike her.
This afternoon the defense began the
examination of witnesses and Mlsa Mor
rison was placed on the stand in her own
behalf. Her testimony was exceedingly
sensational and she frequently requested
the court to permit her to put some of
Leldenhelmer's language into writing
rather than utter the words.
While admitting the killing of Leiden
heimer, she asserted that it was because
of his repeated overbearing conduct to
ward her and numerous insults she had
received from him.
She testified that after she Joined the
"Plaster of Paris" company, Leidenheim
er was very friendly until he found that
she was married and that her husband
would accompany her on the road. From
that time, she said, he began. a systema
tic persecution; he made improper pro
posals to her and insulted her frequently;
he often called her foul namea and per
sisted in his course of abusing her until
she lost all control of herself.
On the evening of the shooting, she
said, Leidenheimer offered her an indig
nity. When he did this she lost control of
herself, and when she went to the stage
by the rear stairway. Just as she reached
the top of the steps Leidenheimer ap
proached her and called her a foul name.
From that moment she had no memory
of what happened. The time between
that moment and when she found herself
in the station house was a blank in her
mind. Explaining why she had the pistol
on this particular evening she said that
she always carried a pistol.
On cross-examination she said that she
had borne Leidenhelmer's Insults until she
had learned that she was to be supplanted
in Atlanta by another woman, and that
she then became desperate.
At this point court adjourned until to
morrow, when Miss Morrison will be
cross-examined further.

POLICE STOP THE
NEILL-O'BRIEN FIGHT
The Californian Is Fouled and Is Helpless
After Maintaining a Decided Lead for
Twelve Rounds â Green Knocks Out Ast.
â¢Â£=3 ftJPTAIN OF POLICE GILrLIN
ff stopped the fight between Al Neill
U and "Jack' O'Brien last night in
\Zz-J Woodward's Pavilion- in the fif
teenth round. At the moment
Neill'e hands were at his side and O'Brien
was showering blows on his head and
body. The onslaught electrified the crowd,
as but an instant before the order was re
versed, Nelll being the aggressor and
O'Brien the man severely punished. This
had practically been the ordÂ».-r for all the
rounds from the second, except when
Neill stood and allowed O'Brien to hit
him, that the latter might fight himself
out.
After Captain Glllin had stopped the
bout the men showed an inclination to
continue, and Referee Cook seemed favor
able to allowing them to do so.
The police cleared the ring before hostil
ities could be renewed, and the supporters
of each boxer can, and undoubtedly will,
claim for all time that their man would
have won ;f the fight had been allowed to
continue.
Nelll was hurried to his dressing
room and was at once examined by
Dr. Luetig. An abrasion on the groin I
about an Inch lor.jj was found and the
claim was made that this blow below the
belt was the cause of the Californian's
sudden collapse. It rendered him helpless !
for the next moment and changed his at- !
titude from that of a man winning easily I
to one of abject helplessness. Nelll \
claimed that a left uppercut aimed at him j
by O'Brien landed below the belt and did '
the damage.
O'Brien affirms that the blow was land- ;
ed fairly on the pit of the stomach, and |
that none of the rules of boxing were I
transgressed when it was delivered. The
Philadelphia^ was much distressed men
tally, claiming- that he was entitled to the i
decision. The majority of the spectators
did not agree with him in this, as he was
& hepeiessly beaten man for many rounds, i
O'Brien practically lost the use of his left ;
arm alter the second round, and at i:m*s I
Neiil stood up and let him hit with both â¢Â¦
hands without trying to defend himself.
He said afterward that he found O'Brien I
could not sting him and he was letting
the Philadelphian light himself to a stand- !
still.
Neill devoted much of his attention to
O'Brien's body, and after a time the blows
plainly had their effect.
O'Brien was quick to fee them coming
and doubled up to avoid them. Those that
lande-d shook him up badly, and there was j
a look of p;Jn in his face each time which j
spoke volumes for the effect they had on !
him. Neill showed marked improvement Â¦
over his former fights and Is easily the j
premier middle-weight of the West. He !
blocked many blows which the spectators i
thought reused his guard, and apparently |
has the hitting powers of a heavy-weight.
O'Brien showed marvelous cleverness j
as a boxer until he emerged from a terri
fic engagement in the second round. This '.
took the steam out of his blows, and from '
that point to the end he did but little i
damage.
When the grrvng sent the men together
for the first time they feinted for a mo
ment. O'Brien was the first to lead, but
Neill smothered the blow. O'Brien
rushed in and landed a left on the body,
following it with a left uppercut. He kept
ot Nelll and in a clinch peppered him,
beating a cuick tattoo on head and body
with itoth hands. He rushed Neill. The
latu-r ducked and O'Brien was thrown
over his shoulder, landing on his feet. In
a clinch he jolted Neill and the latter
came back with right and left on body,
his Srst effort at attack.
The second and third rounds provide*!
the most sensational boxing ever sÂ»en In
the Woodward's arena. O'Brien was the
first to cut loose and tried an uppercut.
This warn r.ot effective, and he rushed
Nelll around the ring. He was landing re
peatedly but without damage. Neill
etopped his gallop â¢with a left fao and fol
lowed it with another, which turned
O'Brien around. ThiÂ« started the mix-up,
which lasted until the end of the round.
The men cast caution and the rules of
boxing to the winds and stood u;i ex
changing a perfect fusillade of blows. The
Fpertators leaped to their feet and The big
building was in an uproar. It seemed llesh
itnd blood could not stand the strain to
which the young athletes were subject-
ing themselves and that one or the other
must drop from exhaustion. When tho
gong sounded the spectators had worked
themselves into a perfect frenzy.
This was the effort from which O Brien
did not recuperate. In the third round
Nelll saw his advantage and was the ag
gressor. There was some more slugging
in which each took some punishment.
Neiil then landed a right and left which
stac-gered O'Brien. Neill was vicious ana
landed several times, dazing O'Brien.
Both men tired rapidly toward the end
and could hardly etand.
Neill recuperated more rapidly and
looked the fresher, but O'Brien was the
first on his feet at the gong. Neill Jolted
him with his left on the face and then
missed a left swing which would have
ended proceedings then and there had It
landed. O'Brien responded with a right
on the body and took a stiff one In re
turn. By this time the Phlladelphlan had
lost his jaunty air and his fancy boxing
and settled down to a hard eiege of fight
ing. He landed often, but without dam
age to Neill.
The fifth round was a resting spell for
both men, there being much feinting, and
finally a mix-up in O'Brien's corner. Nelll
had the best of a quick exchange and
jabbed with his left just before the bell.
Neiil was the aggressor In the next round
and plainly worried O'Brien with- his
feinting. O'Brien commenced to complain
to Referee Cook about some of Neill's
blows. He tried for a right and missed,
getting one In return. In a mix-up It was
all Neill's. At the end of this round
O'Brien's seconds paid much attention to
his left arm. He used it very carefully
after that. O'Brien appealed to the ref
eree again in the next round. â¢
He received some stinging blows on head
and body which staggered him. Nelll
missed one right and ducked into an vp r
percut.
In the eighth round O'Brien caught Neill
with a right that Bhook him up. He tried
again, but Neill blocked the blow and
landed In return. Neill landed again and
O'Brien's legs bent under him. He pulled
himself together and landed several right
swinsrs. In this round O'Brien showed a
kangaroo-like spring at his opponent
which was a new one on the crowd.
From the ninth round on Nelll paid
much attention to the body. He seemed
quite fresh, while O'Brien had a some
what bedraggled look. Neill led In the
tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and
fourteenth rounds. In the latter he land
ed just after the bell signaled the end of
the round. O'Brien claimed a foul, but
the referee would not allow it.
In thÂ«Â» fifteenth and last round Nelll
started quickly, as though to end proceed
ings then and there. He landed his right
several times, and the men were wrestling
ar,d Ftruggling around the ring. O'Brien
was getting the worst of it. and the crowd
was cheering Neill. urging him to finish
his opponent. Suddenly Neill's hands
dropped to hip side and O'Brien turned on
him like a flash. He landed as he please i
and Neill's head began to rock. Just as
tbe latter seemed to recover his strength
Captain Gillln entered the ring and
stopped the men. Referee Cook declared
it a draw.
The preliminary between Ast and Green
was slow when compared with the brisk
ness which characterized the main event.
Green had the advantage of Ast In rlngr
experience and put him out in the eighth
round. A right and left on the head
started Ast on the down grade, and a
right Jolt on the head finished him. Ast
fell toward his opponent and hung limp
on his ehoulder for a moment. Green
Ftepped back and Ast fell to the floor on
his face. The crowd was not sure that
Ast had received a blow sufficiently hard
to put him out of business and there was
some hissing.
From the start Green was the aggressor
and reached Ast repeatedly. Ast came
back with some jabs on the face, but he
was slow and the blows did little dam
ape. Green developed a lons reach In the
second round and landed several times on
the body when he seemed out of range.
Ho tried repeatedly for a right swing-, but
missed.
Ast was knocked down twice In the
third round. He was down again in the
fifth and was nearly counted out. Green
showed himself a seasoned campaigner
and vras always busy. He had a decided
l^ad up to the end when he put Ast out.
The latter was up and able to walk to
his corner almost as soon as the time
keepers tolled off the fateful ten seconds.

FOOTBALL GAME
EAST VS. WEST
EVERY SEASON
PLANS FOR BIG CONTESTS
Faculty Interference in College Ath
letics Not Likely to Result
in Many Changes.
WINTER football on the Pacific
Coast seems an assured sport,
lt has previously been the cus
tom for one or both the college
teams to take trips either north or south
during" the winter vacation, meeting rep
resentative Pacltic Coast elevens, usually
from" the athletic clubs. But this season
a precedent has been established which
will, in all- probability, set a custom for
one big San Francisco game on Christ
mas'day, in which the winner of the In
tercollegiate contest and some famous
Eastern team will figure. The loser will
then "take to the tall timber" and meet
the brawn of the north or south.
California's game with Carlisle proved
conclusively that bringing an Eastern
team out to San Francisco 13 no such
hazardous venture as was- at first sup
posed. The Indians traveled In a special
car, stayed at the Palace Hotel for four
days and- there were twenty men In the
party at that. With all this expense Cal
ifornia came out $luoo ahead of the game.
Then, again, it Is Imagined that the tacul
tles of the Eastern colleges are averse to
such. trips. It was a mere accident that
prevented the University of Chicago
eleven from visiting the coast this win
ter. -Princeton at one time was scheduled
to come and but a single vote in a faculty
meeting- turned the tide and put the ban
upon a continental journey by the Tigers.
â¢ Long before the football season opens
this year plans will be laid by both col
lege managers to secure pledges of games
from some ot the big Eastern elevens.
Now. that- it has been demonstrated that
California can vie with the East on the
gridiron the local men will go Into the
battle with more assurance and less fear
of: defeat. The crowd that was In attend
ance at the Christmas day game will be
enlarged next year, for the reason that
a close contest might well be expected.
As indicated shortly after the intercol
legiate game the faculty athletic commit
tees of the two universities expressed a
desire to take the helm of the athletic
ship and steer lt where they willed. No
imported coaches, a shorter season and
garm-son the college campus was the cry
of the professors.
Â¦ But there is one man In Berkeley who
Is pretty much the whole thing and that
is- President Wheeler. He has said au
thoritatively that he will not interfere
with the students' affairs, especially In
athletics, so long as there Is no trend
toward professionalism. President Wheel
er, who Is a whole-souled man of the
world, believes the student can work out
his own salvation on the athletic field
and the least interference with his plans
by those In higher authority the purer
and more harmonious will be the result.
There Is not likely to be a change made
this year. Instead of one big game in
San Francisco there will probably be two
each year and coaches will be Imported
just as of old. In fact lt Is agreed upon
by all â¢ the college men that the Eastern
coach Is still essential to Western foot
ball. How long. he will be necessary is
another question, which time alone can
answer. ; . â¢>Â¦â¢â¢-â¢-Â¦

Witness Disappears.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. s.â Henry Bram
merman. the only eye-witness to the
shooting of Frank Bowman by "Doc"
Crandall. now on trial for the third time,
has disappeared. The prosecution depend
ed upon his testimony to a large extent.
He Is supposed to be in hiding.
Nobody to Blame.
The Coroner's jury yesterday In the ease
of Edward Walsh, the painter who was
killed last Thursday afternoon by being:
jammed In an elevator In the building at
ZIS Beale street, rendered a verdict of ic
ddental death. Walsh anil his companions
had rigged a ladder across the elevator
shaft and were engaged In palntlns? the
walls, Â¦when the elevator descended and
knocked Walsh Into the pit.

FLY-CASTERS IN SESSION.
The first dinner of the San Francisco
Flycastlntr Club In 13W will be held on tha
9th lnst. The contests for next year will
commence In February at Stow Lake.
Alex Vogelsang, who has lust returned
from Washington, will sneak at the din
ner on the subject. "What McKinley
Thinks of the Flyca?tlng C:ub "
MAY HUNT A COYOTE.
It has been suggested that the master
of the San Mateo Hunt replace for one
day the aniseed bag with a coyote, which
would be a novelty and would surely pro
vide exciting sport. Coyotes can be hnd
from the rabbit catchers In the San Joa
quin Valley for the mere freight charges
The . coyote could be released where
there is the least fencing to mar the sport
and . would provide a fast run and an
exciting kill. A little oil of aniseed ap
plied to his "pads would give the required
scent for the hounds.
YACHS 1 MEN ARE PLANNING.
' On the 10th lnst. a meeting of the mem
bers of San Francisco Yacht Club will be
held, at which a nominating committee
of' three will be appointed. The election
will take place on February 14 at the an
nual meeting. .Dr. T. L. Hill, having
served as commodore for two years, dur
ing which he has done much good work
for the club, will not be v candidate for
renotninatlon. W. N. McCarthy, ex-com
modore and owner of the schooner Ka
mona. Is spoken of as likely to succeed
him He would make an excellent com
modore, as he is a good sailor, an active
yachtsman and the owner of 'a handsome
boat. James Kitterman, owner of "the
fine launch America, is also named for.
the onice of commodore. For^ vice com
modore H. R. Simpkins of the yawl Tra
montana and J. R. Savory of the sloop
Juanita are mentioned. . The former has
belonged to the club for too short a time
to be well known to the members, while
the latter has on several occasions done
good service. E. C. Bartlett will probably
be. the next recording secretary, succeed
ing himself, while W. G. Morrow will be
re-elected financial secretary and R. B.
Hogue treasurer. A new measurer will
probably be chosen, and ex-Vice Commo
doro G. T. S., White, formerly owner of
the sloop Will o' the Wisp, is likely to be
nominated.
The annual dinner of the Corinthian*
at .their Tlburon clubhouse was a most
successful affair. It served well to close
the season of 1599 and open that of 1900.
H. -D. Hawks, the nominee for commo
dore, made a good speech. I To be nom
inated for an cilice in the Corinthian
Yacht Club is almost equivalent to being
elected, for the nominating committee en
deavors to reconcile all parties and to
secure candidates who -will -be accepta
ble to the members. Thus it may be re
garded as certain that the following will
be elected at the annual meeting as offi
cers and directors for the coming year:
H..D. Hawks of the sloop May. commo
dore; K. F. Sagar of the sloop Edna, vice
commodore: Charles L. Barrett, treas
urer; John H. Keefe, port captain; T. L.
Miller of the yawl Guinevere and the
sloop Idler, secretary; W. S. Grover of the
yawl Arcturus and J. V. O'Brien, direc
tors.
The Enclnals seem to have almost given
course Is found to be really practicable
It Is probable that shell rowing will be
come general among the clubs, as smooth
water for regatta days will then be as
sured.
â¢ The Alameda Boat Club, which was or
ganized in February, 1890, will celebrate
its tenth anniversary next month.
OARSMEN AWAIT
THE FIVE-MILE
BARGE CONTEST
SOUTH ENDS. ARE HOPEFUL
Representatives "of Both . Crews
Have Agreed. to Refrain From
Regular. Training.
ON Sunday last the . Foley-Dennis
barge crew of the South End Row-
Ing Club went out for practice, mak
ing a trip to the Dolphin. boathouse
and back. On the way out they made fast
time and feel confident that they .will give
a good account of themselves In the race
against the Alameda seniors. ' It Is under
stood between the challengers and the
acceptors that there shall be.no regular
night practice for the race, but that the
crews shall race without systematic
training. The South Ends will drop out
If they find that the challengers are un
dergoing a course of training. Â¦ It is likely
that If both crews are untrained .the South.
Ends can stand the long pull better than
the . Alamedans, for they, are wiry, ath
letic men, whereas two. of the Alameda
crew, while strong men enough, will prob
ably ttnd four and a half miles a hard
strain. The Alameda crew will be made
up as follows: J. Lewis, bow; D.G. Green
leaf, No. 2; W. G. Hansen, No. 3; F. W.
Ayers, stroke; E. Hansen, cockswain.
The crew. is rowing. well. It has been said
that it is. foolish and even dangerous for
men accustomed to mile and a quarter
races to row a flve-mllo content; but any
man In sound condition and accustomed to
rowing ought to Hnd no difficulty In last-
Ing for the distance, though, of cburse,
he -could not keep, up a fa.it stroke. As
both crews will" be untrained they will bo
on equal' terms and the race will probably
resolve Itself into a steady, pull for- the
greater part'of the distance, wlth'a spurt
at the end. ... ...
The newly elected officers 'of the South
End Rowing Club will be initiated at the

The editor of Los Angeles Wheeling:
does not take kindly to Lennle'a auto
cratic ways in cycling, but It is neverthe
less the fact that if there were more men
of "Bob's" stamp active In the sport cy
cling would never know a dull minute,
particularly in the racing line.
"Trilby" Fowler, the clever local trie*
rider who went south with Lennle and
Osten'dorf. was badly Injured whi!Â» riding
on the street at Los Angeles Christmas

Indisposition and will take the chair, at
the meeting. \
Don H. Donnelly of Burlingame has had
the misfortune to lose the prize-wlnniig
collie Floss, which was killed by the trnun

Philip C. Meyers' dog Minstrel Boy. died
<m Tuesday of pleuro-pneumonla. In spite
of the bost effort* of the veterinary sur

of San Francisco Golf Club;-T. W. Tetley
of San Rafael Golf Club; James Melville
of Del Monte; Alexander Smith of Coro
nado Golf Club, and John Dunn. The last
named will reach Oakland on the 11th to
secure some practice before the tourna
ment. R. Foulls and Way have cot been
heard from, but William Watson of Pasa
dena writes that his time is so fully occu
pied In giving Instruction that he has de
cided not to enter his name as a competi

Alexander Smith Is a brother of Will
Smith of the Midlothian Country Club of
I Chicago, the present open champion; he
learned golf on the links at Canioustie,
Scotland, and is considered one of the
cleanest of professionals. He is one of the

There was no regular tournament on the
links of the San Rafael Golf Club on New
Year's day, though several members went
around the course. No schedule of events
will be prepared until the eighteen-hole
course Is ready for play. There will, how
ever, probably be an opening and recep
tion day during February, to which mem
bers of all the clubs near San Francisco
will be Invited. Instructor T. W. Tetley
has been down with la grippe and acute
tonsllltls for more than a week.
The greens committee of the Edison

The flrst meeting of the golf club re-
up - ya-ht!ng. Commodore J. â¢S. Hanley
has sold his schooner Frances, and so will
not be eligible for re-election. The an
chorage oft the Alameda shore Is bad. be
ing shoal and exposed. There Is appar
ently not room for two prosperous yacht
clubs on. that side of the bay. Men who
want to yacht would do well to join the
Callfoxnlas, while those who wish bowls,
billiards, whist and other social diversions
can find them In the Enclnal Club, the
finances of which have always been In a
tatlsfactory condition. The Interest of
the Enclnals In yachting almost wholly
depended on the enthusiasm of Commo
dore Leonard, and when he departed for
Alaska, taking his yacht El Sueno with
him. little more- was done by the mem
bers In that direction. The club will give
a dance on Washington's birthday.
RAIN COMES TO
SPOIL THE SPORT
OF THE GUNMEN
DUCKS AGAIN SCATTERED
The Legal Season for Duck and
Cuail Shooting Is Drawing
Rapidly to a Close.
JUST as the sportsmen were settling
down to the enjoyment of lUgh-clas.-*
shooting the recent threatening
weather broke and a deluge of water
ensued. The club men who were on tho
marshes last Saturday had the best of tho
shooting. On Sunday moderate bags were
the rule, while on Monday the returns
were generally small, the storm having
scattered the birds by that time. The
marshes are completely overflowed now
and the birds scattered over a wide area.
The preserves are one sheet of water, all
marks of ponds being obliterated. Until
the water subsides the returns to the gun
men will be small. During the storm im
mense flocks of sprig were seen wending
their way southward.
Secretary W. E. Robertson of the Marln
County Fish and Game Protective Associ
ation is sending out notices to gun men.
calling their attention to the fact that tho
season for quail shooting closes oa tho
15th inst.
H. L. Miller was "high gun" at tho
Olympic Gun Club preserve during tha
New I' ear's shootlnsr. He secured 20 birds.
\V. D. McArthur and J. Homer Fritch, had
a joint bag of 23. L. H. Harpham killed

liam Bay, R. H. Delafleld, J C. Jenaon.
H. L. Rose and L. Titus. t> each.
The officers of the Olympic Gun Club
are sanguine of being able to concentrata
the trap shooting done in the metropoli
tan district during the forthcoming season
at their grounds. The idea is pronounced
an excellent one by the gun men. It will
centralize the sport, meaning large field:*
and more valuable prizes. This will help
the clubs, as the shooters will all bo
brought together. It will also mean
greater rivalry and better shooting. There
is but little money invested In other
grounds, so that to abandon them will nuC
entail a loss.
President John Lemmer of the Black
Jack Club enjoyed the cream of the shoot
ing over the club's Sherman Island pre
serve on Saturday. The heavy wind pre
ceding the storm which broke on Monday,
had the effect of sending down a greac
flight of ducks. Mr. Lemmer baersed rifty
slx fine canvasbacks during the day and
retired satisfied. Newton Hickman, Bert
Patrick. Fred Johnson and Billy Swain
did their shooting on Monday and had to
be content with a total bag of thirty
eight birds. There will be no shooting on
the preserve this week, as the island ta
completely overflowed. Bert Patrick will
try the sport on Richardson Bay to-day
in a launch with Charles Arnold of Sac
ramento. The bay ts fairly alive with
canvasbacks; but they are not ttt to eat.
They live on fish and the fishy taste de
stroys the flavor of the meat.
The sport at ML Eden and along the
shores of the bay was excellent. At Mt.
Eden the Hightmeyer brothers and a
guest secured a total bag of ninety ducks.
These included canvasbacks, spoonbills
and bluebills.
McDonald brothers, shooting at the
same place, secured 100 birds between
At the preserve of the Pastime Club
a total of 200 birds fell to six guns during
a shoot extending over two days.
L. R. Larzalere and J. H. Burfeind had
the Spoony Club preserve near Alvar
ado to themselves and enjoyed good sport.
At Willow Lodge Dr. Lane. W. K. Shaw
and a third party secured ninety _ birds.
Dan Ross. Plummer and McPnllllps had
a good shoot at Newark, securing nearly
100 duck* of various varieties.
Big bags have been secured at Jersey,
nenr Antloch. on the overflowed land?.
One sportsman secured ninety-six "cans'
in the cmarse of a day's shooting.
Hart Williams and Dr. Marsh shot over
the Cordelia Gun Club's preserve The
former killed forty ducks, of which si x
t*>pn were "cans, while his companion
killed seventy-six, of which thirty-ona
were the muchly sought "cans. /
Otto Feudner. Achille Roos and A. M.

United States. Mr. Meyers' loss Is prac
tically Irreparable, but he has already
commenced negotiations with Mrs. Lee of

Mr. Muenter of Lathrop has sent his
St. Bernard, Queen of the San Joaquin,
to Oakland to be bred to Mr. White's

AN ORGAN OUT OF GEAR.
I ; ROM the Evening Post, the organ which the
j railroad company has placed at the diÂ«poÂ«al of
Burns, the surprising statement was put forth
yesterday: "Whatever conclusion Governor Gage
may reach in the matter of the extra session, no time
should be lost by the authorities of this city in calling
his attention to the fact that if it is contemplated it is
important that repealing the tax on municipal bonds
should becoaie a part of its object."
If the Post had given any intelligent attention to
the course of legislation last winter it would have
knbwn that the Legislature has achieved all it can
toward bringing about the repeal of the tax. The
Post, however, was so busily engaged during the ses
sion in urging the candidacy of Burns for the United
States Senate that it neglected to pay attention to
anything that was done except in the Senatorial con
test. It can find a good deal of information valuable
to itself, therefore, if it will consult the records and
learn what was done.
Chapter XXXIII, page 500, of Statutes and
Amendments to the Codes. 1899, is as follows: "Re
solved by the Senate (the Assembly concurring),
That the Legislature of the State of California, at its
regular session, commencing on the second day of
January, 1899, two-thirds of all members elected to
each House concurring, hereby proposes that article
XIII of the constitution of said State be. amended
by adding thereto a new section, number one and
three-fourths, which shall read as follows: Section
1 $i â All bonds hereafter issued by the State of Cali
fornia or by any county, city and county, municipal
corporation or district (including school, reclamation
or irrrgation districts) within said State shall be free
End Exempt from taxation."
The resolution Was adopted March 17, 1899. It is
numbered Senate constitutional amendment No. 14,
and will be submitted to the people for adoption at
the election next November.
It will be seen that the Legislature has nothing
â¢whatever to do with the matter, and that in urging
an extra session to repeal the tax the Post exposes
rot only the eagerness of the Burns and railroad
combination to bring about extra session, but its
own ignorance of the law of the State and the current
issues before the people.
The Burns forces are, in fact, grasping at straws
and at shadows. Anything that shows an outward
feemihg of an excuse for calling an extra session is
eagerly seized and used for more than it is worth.
This late attempt to deceive the public into the belief
that an extra session will be required to repeal the
foolish tax on local bonds is but one of the many
codges and subterfuges resorted to by the combine.
The Post should post itself and not permit its edi
torial columns to be monkeyed with in such a crude
way.
ANOTHER ISLAND FOR US.
OUT in the Far East, among the Asiatic islands
that lie remote beyond the melancholy main,
the expansion of our colonial empire goes on
apace. Dispatches just received at Washington from
Cavite announce that on December 21 the commander
of the gunboat Albany hoisted our flag on the island
of Sibulu. The dispatch, adds: "The chief Dato
provided and raised the pole. The natives and North
Borneo authorities are pleased."
The reports from Washington add to the dispatch
the information that the island lies at the southwest
ern angle of the boundary line of the quadrangle in
closing the Philippine group. It is probably, but not
positively, outside the line, and lies very near the
cotst of Borneo, commanding the principal channel,
but is not one of the islands of the Philippines. The
Sultan of Jolo, whose group is close to this island, is
believed to claim jurisdiction over it,' and -as his
authority is recognized by the native tribes on the
north coast of Borneo and vicinity, it is believed that
his claim is well founded. It was probably at his in
stance the naval officer commanding the gunboat
moved.
The suggested probability that we have taken the
island at the request of the Sultan of Jolo is. not
wholly pleasing. The Sultan is our good friend, and
we are of course willing to do almost anything for
him within the limits of reason. We give him the
protection of our fleets, pay him a liberal subsidy
so that he may maintain his harem well stocked and
well dressed without taxing his slaves too much, and
provide him with a large amount of free advertising.
We can hardly be expected, however, to give him an
island every time he wishes one, for though islands in
those seas are plentiful, it costs something to send a
gunboat out to pick them up.
Under the circumstances it is gratifying that the
chief of the captured island^is willing to come in un
der the flag, and was even kind enough to furnish and
raise the pole on which the flag was hoisted. He may
have been influenced by reports of the kind treatment
we have accorded the. Sultan, and, at the time
he raised the pole, raised also a hope that he in his
turn would get a pension, but that does not alter the
fact that his action relieves us from the charge of
conquesting his country. He has come willingly;un
der .the sway of our sovereignty and that of our great
and good friend the Sultan. If after this he take to
wayward courses and chop down the pole we may
with justice shoot him on the spot.
The most pleasing feature of the whole report,
however, is the announcement that the natives and
North Borneo authorities are content with our ac
tion. It would have been a sad beginning of the cen
tury for us had we offended the dignitaries of those
parts and had an embassy from Borneo hastening to
Washington to protest in the name of their idol gods
against the aggressions of Christianity. We suffered
enough from the wild man from Borneo when we
heard him only through the medium of a music-hall
song, and saw him only in the safe confinement of a
sideshow. What, then, might have been our well
nigh intolerable woe had we been compelled to hear
him chant his own song in all the freedom due to a
distinguished Embassador who comes to plead for
liberty and a pension, or statehood and an appropria
tion?
Weighing the evil with the good, and taking the
thing as a whole, even as we have taken the people
along with the land, we may be sufficiently satisfied
with the affair to thank the Sultan for his kindness
in giving us the island. It is an opening for one or
two new office-seekers, and may prove profitable to
some deserving man who will leave his country for.
his country's good. It is to be hoped, however, that
our enterprising officials in the East will not be too
prompt in taking islands at the Sultan's suggestion.
The genial old slave-holding polygamist may take
a notion some day that it would be a good thing to
annex and bring under our flag every island where
slavery and polygamy prevail, and that would be too
much for our good.
A CHANGE OF HEART.
BRIGADIER GENERALjOTIS of the Los
Angeles Times has broken out with a perfect
eczema of sympathy for Great Britain and her
attempt to destroy the two South African republics.
He denounces American sympathy with the Boers
as demagogy, and has discovered that nothing is bet
ter for mankind than "the protection and prestige" of
Great Britain. He denounces Kruger as a drspot, an
oligarch, an absolutist, a' promoter of real ruin and
anarchy, a Dutch autocrat, and his American sympa
thizers as "yawpers who would better cease their
yawpings." General Otis even permits his paper, like
Silas Wegg, to drop into poetry and apostrophize
"Old Eneland" in such rhymes as this:
"The well beloved of the sea.â
The birthplaceâ home of libertyâ
The hope of ages yet to beâ
Old England stands.
The mighty mother of the freeâ
The land of lands.
"Her peerlesc glory ne'er cap fade-
No, not until this globe decayedâ
Unoceaned and unarrayed â
Of pulsing air.
A drear, dead world of shade â
No life shall boar."
From which we infer that if the Boers whip the Eng
lish the whole blooming thing will be at once un
oceaned and unarrayed, and even Southern California
will be a drear-dead world of shade. The brigadier
further refers to England as omnipotent, "holding"
the constellations high," and in wisdom knocking the
spots off Solomon, Solon, Lycurgus and Demos
thenes, leaving no great man standing unexcelled ex
cept the brigadier himself, spared probably to tell
about it
I\ot only this, but the general declares that Rome's
valor prevails in England's sons, arifl â
"Her daughters fair
No breath attainful e'er assails.
Sweet, past compare."
Tut, tut. general, and at your age and girth, too!
Only a few years ago, before he crossed the Rubi
con, General Otis had quite a different opinion of
England. He was one of the concocters of the cele
brated "Murchison letter" written to the British
Minister at Washington, asking his advice how to
vote in the Presidential election of ISBB. The British
Minister was fool enough to answer the decoy letter
and was sent howling home by Mr. Bayard for in
terfering in American politics.
At that time General Otis insisted that this incident
proved that we were about to be subjected again to
British tyranny and that Englishmen were being
naturalized here solely for the purpose of voting us
back to slavery under the lion and the unicorn.
In fine, he then accused England of just the same
intentions toward us as she is now attempting to en
force upon the South African republics.

THE WEST INDIAN PROBLEM.
DENMARK has long desired to sell her island
possessions in the West Indies, and since the
success of Spain in selling the Carolines to
Germany for a good round sum the desire has become
keener than ever. It is said efforts are now being
made by her statesmen to dispose of St. Thomas to
the United States or to Germany, # and by the jinco
press the argument is made that we must buy them or
the Kaiser will, and we shall then have the aggres
sive German empire strongly fortified within easy
reach of our shores.

fairs another problem. Porto Rico is ours, and a

BANK CIRCULATION.
THE report of the Government finances shows
an increase in the issue of national bank notes
amounting to more than two millions last
month.
During that month there were two acute periods of
panic in the money market. The withdrawal of money
from the centers caused by the usual autumn move
ment of the crops had pinched the speculative oper
ators. Money was hard to get to put up on margins.
The speculative stocks were being crowded on the
market, and sound non-speculative securities were
shrinking also. There has been no better opportunity
for many years for the banks to act the vampire and
suck the blood of the people by contracting the cur
rency to reduce prices and then take their pick of the
good things going in the market at a price far below
their real value. The sordid and selfish purpose
ascribed to them by the Chronicle could easily have
added half a billion to their wealth. The mere out
flow of money from the center to the circumference of
the country's commerce, the direction and not the
volume of the stream being changed, caused condi
tions which produced' in one day a shrinkage of one
hundred millions in the market value of property
represented by stocks. That is just the sort of emer
gency of which the sinister and selfish banking sys
tem is supposed to take advantage. According to the
Chronicle's idea the banks should have immediately
refused to pay out their own notes on checks and to
avoid doing so should have even destroyed them. In'
this. way the downward plunge of prices could have
been accelerated and the banks would have fattened
on the general ruin. Xo doubt the Chronicle itself is
surprised that they did not do it. Instead the national
banks increased their emission of currency, and the
banks in the Clearing-house Association in New York
in two days released and threw into circulation
twenty millions of dollars. This access to the volume
of currency brought money on call down from a
panic premium of 140 per cent to 5 per cent. It ar
rested the fall in prices. It brought sound investment
stocks, like sugar, gas and railroads, back to value
par. In other words, ot did everything to the market
which the Chronicle insists the banks don't want.
But the banks did it. Nothing else could have done
it. Even the United States treasury cannot undertake
such a task with safety to its own solvency and to the
public credit. From the standpoint of its own im
peachment of the banks we cannot conceive what
answer the Chronicle can make to this object lesson.
The action of the banks in increasing the volume .of
currency to prevent further fall in prices and stop a
panic that had gained dangerous headway proves The
Call's contention that banks prosper in the solvency
and prosperity of the community, and not in its
bankruptcy, ruin and distress. Therefore their policy
is always to maintain prices if they influence them at
all, and to protect their debtors rather than betray
them.

being at bat if given his base on balls
or is hit by the pitcher, as he haa been
deprived of a proper opportunity of In
creasing his batting average. The bat
ting average is governed by the number
of hits made with times at bat, and it
would be manifestly unfair to charge him
with a "time at bat" when he had no op
portunity to strike at a fair ball.

Ing. The trouble will arise over the action
of John li. Robinson, who when he was
East last year Invited the National Con
gress of the Sons of the American Revo
lution, then in session at Detroit, to hold
their next annual session in this city. Mr.
Robinson was the delegate sent East by
the California society. He says that he
expressly said before he went East that
he would Invite the National Congress to
come here in 1900. Having extended the in
vitation, he issued a circular, dated at
Charlestown, Mass., announcing that an
excursion to California would take place
upon the occasion of the meeting of the
National Congress In this city under the
auspices of the California society and the
National Congress. This circular was sent
out broadcast and copies were received by
the members of the California society.
.Then there began a spicy correspond
ence'that has led up to the expectation
that the annual meeting of the California
society will be a very lively affair. Hor
ace Davis, president of the California so
ciety, wrote to Mr. Robinson that the
board of managers had read his circular
announcing a California excursion with
amazement, and also that, obeying the
Instructions of the board of managers of
the California society, he had written to
the board of general managers disavow
ing all connection with and all responsi
bility for.Mr. Robinson's circular. To this
Mr. Robinson replied that he was even
more amazed than Mr. Davis had been,
because he had read the letter written by
Mr. Davis to the National. Congress, in
which had occurred the words: "We are
hoping that some day the National Con
gress of the Sons may meet in San Fran
cisco."
Edwin Bonnell, secretary of the Cali
fornia society, wrote to Mr. Robinson as
follows: " "I beg to Inform you that at
the last meeting of the board of managers
of the California Society of the American
Revolution a resolution was adopted dis
avowing and repudiating your action in
extending an invitation to the national
society to hold its annual meeting in San
Francisco next year, "and also discounten
ancing all arrangements for an excursion
on your part to that end. The national
board of managers have been notified."
A few days ago Mr. Robinson returned
from the East. He at once had a circular
letter prepared, in which all the corre
spondence was published. Copies of this
he has sent to all the members of the
California society. When the society
comes together next Tuesday night for an
annual election he will probably bring the
matter up for a hearing.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1900.
strong movement is going on to annex Cuba. We
are therefore fairly involved with the West Indies as
a whole,' and must determine what course we arc
to pursue in regard to them. It is not likely that any
considerable number of American psople would like
to see St. Thomas pass from the hands of a weak to
that of a strong European power, and yet grave rea
sons exist why we should not purchase them our
selves.
It is as sure as anything in the future can be that if
we once acquire large possessions in the West Indies
there will arise a demand first for free trade between
the islands and our home markets, and next for ad
mission to the Union. The powerful commercial in
terests that will grow up between us and the island
ers will demand the first, and the politicians will advo
cate the second. Thus the possession of these tropic
islands will bring to us the double danger of an in
dustrial competition which will injure many of our
rural industries, and, second, a political problem
which will complicate every election.
It has been suggested that if we give the Cubans
training in self-government for twenty years they
would then be fitted to manage not only their own
affairs but that of the. other islands alsoi so that a
well ordered West Indian republic would be possible.
That is the most iridescent vision that, ever delighted
the mind of a dreaming statesman. In the first place
a people can never be instructed in self-government.
The more we compel them t6 submit to our instruc
tion the less fitted they will be for independence, for
no people ever learn the lesson of. liberty from the
rule of foreigners. The only thing taught by such
rule is servitude or rebellion. In the second place, if
we ever'fit the Cubans for self-government according
to our ideas they will have become so firmly attached
to the United States they will not be willingly cast
out of our rich markets to share the fate of Hayti
and Sari Domingo.
The issue is one upon which we ought soon to
make up our minds. In many respects it is more im
portant than that of the Philippines, for those
islands are far away and it is not likely that stats
hood will ever be demanded for them, but the West
Indies are close to our shores, and when once the
process of annexation begins it will be hard to draw
a line that will keep them as possessions without'ad
mitting them as parts of the Union.

Chairman Ewald Offers Suggestions
for Permanent Improvements
South of the Park.
The property owners represented by the
improvement club of the Sunset District
are determined to take passage in the van
of progress in so far as their section of
the city is concerned. At a meeting of the
club last night, with President Charles W.
Pope in the chair, Edward Ewald, chair
man of the executive committee, embodied
in his report the following suggestions:
While your committee Is doing Its utmost to
prevent the drifting sand from destroying
Nineteenth-avenue boulevard by planting burr^i
grass as far west In some places as IuOO fCt
from Nineteenth avenue, we hope that *j fit
plan will bÂ« formulated to reclaim all the u'W*
Inhabitable sand dunes south of Golden Gate
Park and west of Nineteenth avenue, which
will make this property one of the most sought
for residence portions In Ban Francisco on ac
count of its proximity to Golden Gate
Park, beautiful marine view and acknowledged
bealthfulness.
The present waste of drifting 1 sand which Is
ever moving east and a menace to the clean
liness of this city can bÂ« made the finest resi
dence district of this city and county at a com
paratively small cost. No epidemic of disease
will ever live In this section of the city, called
Sunset District, on account of the pure air
and salt-laden breezes from the Pacific Ocean.
The transformation of this desert of drift
ing sand Into the most sought after residence
sites In San Francisco must be done by the
combined effort of all the property owners.
For owners of lots or blocks within the area
south of Golden Gate Park and west of Nine
teenth avenue In Sunset district to (Trade or
Improve the same In Its present condition
would be an act of Insanity and a waste of
money.
This whole area must be planted with bunch
crass during one rainy season to make the
ean<s stationary, that permanent rrades may be
established, that owners of lots or blocks there
in may crade and Improve their property and
rrade and pave the streets fronting the same
with safety.
The report was unanimously adopted,
and it was also resolved that only prop
erty owners or their representatives
should be eligible to membership In this
organization.
The president. Charles W. Pope, stated
that he would give any person a building
lot on Nineteenth avenue who would build
a J2500 house.
He was ordered to advertise in The Call
for bids for planting grass.
On motion of Edward Ewald, a vote of
thanks was extended to The Call for the
interest it has taken in the progress of
the Sunset District.

THE people of San Pablo can con
nect no one of the name of Mary
Brown with the young woman
burglar arrested In this city a few
days aÂ«ro and have concluded that
In her dazed condition ebe mispronounced
her name. The police are not certain
whether *hÂ« rave the name of Brown or
Bowen.
There will be no trial of "Mary Brcrwn*
for the alleged crime, if W. S. Zeilin, who
la eald to be her guardian, can prevent it.
Mr. Zeilin declares the young woman Is
Innocent and has offered to make good
thÂ« amount of money of which Drummer
Duncan says he was robbed early yester
day morning at the Burlington HoteL
The disclosures of yesterday add to the
depth of the mystery surrounding the
case, and It is now said that the young
woman arrested for burglar}' was at
tacked by a fit of dizziness, to which she
Is subject, and that while in a dated state
of mind the was drugged and decoyed into
the Burlington, where Duncan says she
stole his money and attempted to take
his $S!W diamond ring out of his room after
pulling It off his finger while ho was
asleep.
Mary points in Duncan"s story are not
clear to the police. He told the officers
that he heard a disturbance in his room,
which he lxafl only rented for the night,
iutfaough he is staying in town, and that
be saw the young woman about to pass
out. He Jumped up aiid grabbed her and
forced her to return a diamond ring
v.nich be says she had taken trora him.
Duncan al*<j claims that he was robbed
of money, but although the woman was
turned over at once to Officers O'Keete
laid Ward not a dollar was fuursd upon
her. nor had she any opportunity to make
hw&y with It. Duncan has not explained
why his door was left open or why he was
sleeping there on that particular night
when he had quarters elsewhere.
The etory told by W. S. Zeilin to Judge
Conlan when the ralr alleged burglar was
fcxroigrned reads like romance.
"The young lady is so w t-;i supplied with
money by her wealthy relatives that she
certainly would not steal, and as to her
committing a burglary It is preposterous,"
eald M-. Zeilin. 'I have known the young
lady for some years and am her guardian.
She is subject to fainting spells and she
carried In her satchel some medicine
Â¦which ehe had to take regularly to pre
vent these tits, which were caused by
acute neuralgia in the head. Before leav
ing my office on Wednesday afternoon I
cautioned her to be careful about the
raedlci&e aad reminded her that while an
attack of unconsciousness might not be
caj.geroua in the quiet of her San Pablo
iiomÂ». !t would be very dangerous on the
crowded streets of the city with its many
street cars and vehicles.
"When I left here I made an appoint
ment to meet her at 7 o'clock, and after
dinner we were to go to the theater. She
did not keep the appointment and I was
at a lofs to understand where she could
have guna I made all possible inquiry
and not till Thursday morning did I learn
that she was in the City Prison booked
for burglary. I was astonished and at
once prepared to put up the necessary
bond. The young woman is very well con
nected, SloA the story told the officers by
the hotel clerk that she was a frequent
visitor to the Burlington Is absolutely
false. I know that ehe has never been
there, and when the clerk was questioned
he could not tell how she got In the hotel,
when Ehe got In, whether she went alone
or with a lady or gentleman friend. She
must certainly have been drugged and
taken there, not knowing where she was
going, or else she was found by some

DANGEROUS MAN CAPTURED
CLEVER BX7SE PRACTICED BY A
â¢ FAID ASSASSIN.
The Chinese Merchants' Association at
723 Commercial street has declared
against the continuance of the highbinder
war which has been In progress for the
past three weeks In this city. Their edict
was Issued at a meeting last night, which
was attended by the leaders of the war
ring tongs, and Is direct and to the point.
It declares for the immediate cessation of
hostilities and threatens serious Inter
ference on the part of the Merchants'
Association if the mandate- is disregarded.
The action taken' by the association is
because of the injurious effects the trouble
has had upon the Chinese trade in this
city.
The trouble between the Hop Sing tong
and the Suey Sing tong started in the in
terior of the State and eventually drifted
to this city. Already several murders
have been committed and more have been
planned. The condition in Chinatown at
the present time is such that members of
the various tongs are afraid to venture on
the highways at night without a body
guard, lest they should be made the tar
get for a highbinder bullet. Large prcea
have been placed on the heads or certain
Chinamen and the fact that they have not
yet been killed is simply because the as
sassins have not found an opportunity to
earn their reward owing to extra police
precautions which have been taken.
The Merchants' Association has a stand
ing reward for the apprehension of crim
inals, in an effort to suppress crime. The
state of affairs is such at present that
they feel the inefficiency of rewards and
they have Issued a strong warning to the
parties at war.
One of the highbinders captured on
Thursday night Is supposed to be a hired
assassin who is wanted for several mur
ders throughout California. ' His name, as
given at the police station, is Hong Fook,
and he halls from Chico. He has beon
posing In the llerht <~t a peacemaker and
recently accompanied the police officers,
pointing out the Suey Sing warriors,
claiming that he was the Interpreter for
the Hop Sing tong. He had three men
arrested last week on the complaint that
they were implicated in the murder of
Horn Teong, and on the strength of his
statements the men were placed In the
tanks. On Thursday morning he informed
the officers that he would depart for Chico
to be gone for a week, but instead of
going he disguised himself and, securing a
large gun, promenaded the streets of
Chinatown that evening in search of a
victim. When he was taken by- the police
a number of Chinamen identified him as
a well-known slayer. A thorough inves
tigation will be made of his case by the
police.
The excitement had not subsided laÂ«t
night, and while the police captured no
htfrhblnders with guns, still. Sergeant of
Police Anderson received information that
a highbinder had been seen on the street
with one in his possession.

Labor Unions at Outs.
-There is not peace and harmony exist
ing between the Ship and Steamboat'Joln
ers' Protective associations and the house
carpenters. The cause that has led to
this unpleasantness dates back to the
time when there was a demand for ship
Joiners to work on the Government ves
sels. At that time the house carpenters
were sought to work on the vessels. Since
then work has become somewhat dull at
the water front and the services of the
carpenters are not required, yet they in
sist upon applying for work on the ships,
much to the displeasure of the Joiners.
Complaint has been made to unions 453
and 22 of the carpenters to call off some
of their men from the ships.
For some reason those unions have
acted dllatorfly In the matter and as a
consequence the grievance was taken Into
the Labor Council for adjustment. This
body referred the whole matter to Its ex
ecutive committee with full power to act.
At the meeting of the council last night
It was decided to submit the matter au
thoritatively to the linlons mentioned for
definite action before the council locks
horns with the so-called offenders. A
similar action was taken with reference
to some offending members of the 'mu
sicians' union.

enough to be a thief or to put up a clever
Job. She gives evidence of her refinement
and education, and after hearing Mr. Zeil
in'* story I made the bail as low as possi
ble. I talked with the girl and she said
she has no knowledge of how she got Into
the Burlington.
"When ene went out early in the even-
Ing. Mr. Zeilin tells me, she had a hand
satchel and valuable umbrella, as well as
$50 In coin. On the satchel was a silver
tag with her name and these must have
bf>en stolen from her, for they have not
been found in the Burlington, and if they
could be located they would throw some
light on what Is now very mysterious.
There Is nothing about the girl to Buggest
that she is a criminal, certainly she is not
a burglar. It will be useless for anybody
to try to square the case out of court, for
I shall permit no such thing. It will come
up for trial next Tuesday morning."
Martin Quinlan, the attorney engaged
by Mr. Zeilin to defend the young woman,
says she has no explanation to give be
cause ehe can remember but little of the
eventful night. "She told me that ehe
must have been overtaken In a fit or have
been drugged early in the evening, said
h*>r attorney, "for otherwise she would
certainiy have kept her appointment with
her guardian. After that she must have
been taken to the Burlington, but she has
no recollection of going to Duncan s room
or of handling his diamond ring. She aid
not regain her 6enses till next morning at
the City Prison, and then she at once sent
for Mr. Zeilin. She Is as Innocent as a
baby, and I do not think she will ever be
tried, for Duncan certainly can have no
hope of making out a case. His conduct
is almost as mysterious as that of the
young woman."

last night he was pronounced out of

"If she had stolen $53 from the man Dun

certainly could not have swallowed it If
she ever touched Duncan's diamond, it
was done while she was not in a state of
mind to know what she was doing. I am
quite willing to pay Duncan all he says he
was robbed of, and more if necessary, to
end those proceedings. The young woman
Is an earnest church member, and there is
not a criminal desire In her nature."
Judge Conlan was present when Zetlln
offered to pay Duncan the money he said
he had lost, but he advised against any
such .proceeding.
"This case must now be tried," said
Judge Conlan. "I will permit .no compro

and he will have ample opportunity to
prove It. The case Is one of the most mys

ThÂ« entire coast seems to be participat

at San'Franclsco. From all over the State
come reports of a heavy rainfall and the
Sacramento River Is still up at the dan

height at 24.5 feet, with an upward ten

Taking the different sections of Califor

the localities of the places mentioned:
Red Bluff.- .04; San Francisco, .02; San
Luis Oblspo, .06; and Los Angeles, .0L
From Northern California, Washington
and Oregon come reports of storms of
wind ana -rain. Storm signals are being
displayed all tlong the coast from Neah
Bay. to Port Harford and, as the bad
weather In the north seems to be travel-

section of the coast may expect another
drenching before they have done with tho

TRIED TO BUNKO
A VISITOR FROM

Scott of Sydney Has

POKER WITH STRANGERS HAD
NO ATTRACTIONS FOR HIM.
Raw Work of a Gang of Confidence
Men Who Came Down
Here on the Walla
Walla.
Some people are farmers, some look like
farmers and others are sized up as hay
seeds, though, as a matter of fact, their
pursuits are far removed from that of the
verdant individual whose pride is centered
in the size of the succulent cucumber and
the sleekness of the maternally inclined
cow.
N. Scott.. a recent arrival at the Occi
dental, is one of the latter class. In private
life he is a large shoe merchant of Syd
ney, N. S. W., but ever since he left his
home to travel abroad he has been made
the object of bo many gold-brick schemes
that he is seriously thinking of setting
himself up as a sure-thing expert and in
structing prospective globe trotters on the
dajigers that will beset their paths while
in America and the manner in which the
snares may be avoided.
Mr. Scott arrived in Victoria from the
land of the kangaroo a few days ago.
From there he took the steamer Walla
Walla for this city. With him was travel-
Ing Mr. Davis, who is likewise an antipo
dean aborigine.
On the steamer was a crowd of confi
dence men who were putting in their
spare time working any of the other
passengers who were gullible enough to
be caught In their web. One individual
lost $250, but upon complaining: to the cap
tain succeeded in recovering $120 of his
losses.
Several attempts were made on the Scott
and Davis sacks, but the two travelers
were wary and could not be caught.
Thursday morning as Mr. Scott waa
slowly walking up Sutter street be was
accosted by a smooth-looking stranger
who gave his name as E. C. Samy and
who claimed to have made Scitt's ac
quaintance on the steamer. Scott remem
bered having had him as a fellow passen
ger, but did not place him with the sharp
ers with whom ha had traveled down the
coast.
Samy invited the Australian in to have
a drink and over a social glass confided
to him the reason that had brought him
to San Francisco. According to the plaua
ible Samy. he was interested in the man
ufacture of stoves, and was soon to intro
duce some of his really superior wares
into the colonies. He had been negotiat
ing for a mine "up country" which was
rich with a peculiar metal particularly
adapted to the manufacture or stoves and
ranges. The mine also contained gold in
large quantities but this was a secondary
consideration. Samy was after the stove
metal and did not care a cuss for the gold.

A SAILOR'S FISHY STORY.
Charles Ackerman of the Bark Oak
land Became Infatuated With
a Girl in a Dance Hall.
Charles Arkerman, a sailor on the bark
Oakland, lying off the Harrison street
wharf, told a romantic story at the
Southern police station early yesterday
morning of his experience with a woman
he met in the Columbia dance hall on
Montgomery avenue. He became infat
uated with the woman and took her to
the Winchester House. 44 Third street,
where he registered as "Captain Mogan
and wife." He gave her $475 to keep for
him and she walked out of the place. Ho
ran after h^r and asked Special Police
man Con Kelly to arrest her, but he de
clined, and Bupgested he should get a reg
ular officer. He did so, and he says that
when he returned the woman and the
special officer had disappeared.
Special Officer Kelly tells a different
story. He says he was approached by
Ackcrman. who asked him to arrest the
woman. He did so and took her to the
patrol box at Third and Mission streets
to ring for the "patrol wagon. Arkerman
followed t!nm and told Kelly that he
would not prosecute.- the woman and In
f=!fted that she be> released. Kelly took
her l;ack to the Winchester House, and
aft^r questioning the clerk and hearing
thi- woman's story, which showed that
instead of Ackerman having $475, he Oid
not have enough to meet his obligations,
K<-lly allowed her to go. He got her
rwmc ard address and she can he found
et any time. Detective George McMahon
has been detailed on the case.

FOUR BOXES DID IT.
Bemarkable Success of a New Pile
Cure.
People who have suffered for months or
years from the pain and Inconvenience of
that common disorder, piles, will look
with skepticism upon the claims of the
makers of the new discovery for the cure
of all forms of piles, known as the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure; nevertheless the extraord-
inary cures performed by this remedy are
such as to warrant the investigation of
any sufferer. As a case in point the fol-
lowing letter speaks for itself:
Mr. Henry Thomas of sub-station No. 3.
Hosack avenue, Columbus, Ohio, writes
as follows:
"Gentlemen: I want you to use my
name If it will be of any use to you. I
was so bad with the plies that I lost
work on that account. Nothing did me
any good. I read in Cincinnati of the
many cures of piles by the Pyramid Pile
Cure and I went to a drugstore and asked
for it. The druggist told me that he had
something else that he thought was bet-
ter, but I told him that I wanted to try
the Pyramid first.
"The first box helped me so much that
I tried another and then to complete the
cure used two more boxes, making four
in all. I am now completely cured. Have
not a trace of piles and I had suffered for
years with the worst form of protruding
piles.
"I suffered death from piles, but I found
the Pyramid Pile Cure to be Just as rep-
resented. I have recommended it to sev-
eral of my friends and am thankful to be
able to write and tell you what good the
remedy haa done for me."
Physicians recommend the Pyramid Pile
Cure because it contains no opium, co-
caine or mineral poison of any kind, and
because it is so safe and pleasant to use,
being painless and applied at night. The
patient Is cured in a surprisingly short
time with no Inconvenience whatever.
Pyramid Pile Cure Is sold by druggists
at 50 cents per package, and if there is
any constipation It is well to use the
Pyramid Pills at the same time with the
Pile Cure, aa constipation Is very often
the cause of piles and the pills effectually
remove the costive condition. Price of
pills is 25 cents per package.

Mich., for the little book on cause and
cure of piles; sent by mail free.

VILLIERE'S LOVE TRAGEDY.
Betrayer of Miss Edith Hovrland Ad
mitted His Guilt at the Inquest.
The inquest en the body of Miss
Edith Howland was resumed by Coroner
Hill yesterday. Miss Howland resided
with her father and Filters and brothers
at 3ytÂ» Munich street and earned her living
by working in Brunt's printing establish
ment. Between two and three years ago
she made the acquaintance of Albert J.
Yilliere of 1724 Pine street, and their ac
quaintance ripened Into an illicit intimacy.
The young woman died on December 20
of last year in St. Luke's Hospital from
the effects of a criminal operation per
formed by some unknown person before
she had been taken to the hospital.
At the former hearing of the matter
Mr?. Mary Howland. sister-in-law of the
deceased, testified that Yilliere was re
sponsible for her condition and that he
supplled the money and directed her
where to go.
Yilliere appeared at the Inquest yester
day and 6 wore that he never supplied the
deceased with money for the purpose in
dicated and knew nothing of her Inten
tions. He had paid for her care at St.
Luke's Hospital and had Intended to
marry her as soon as she recovered. He
admitted that he waa the author of her
trouble.
Mr?. Ilowland was recalled, and Insisted
that her testimony on the former occasion
was the truth. She croduced two clip
pings which rhe had found in a purse of
the deceased. They were advertisements
of two women doctors. The deceased had
told her that Villiere had advised her to
go to them for advice and treatment.
The Jury returned a verdict that death
had bec-n caused by a criminal operation
at the hands of persons unknown to the'
jury. Miss Howland was a native of
California anil 22 years old.

FLOGGING IN BRITISH NAVY.
It Is Still a Practice, as the Follow
, ing Account Shows.
On September 23 Thomas McGeehan,
late second class leading stoker on her
Majesty's ship Doris, was flogged at Si
mons Town for the offense of malinger
ing. The report of the circumstances,
which appeared in the Western Morning
News of October 24, is not very lucid, but
1 gather from it that the malingering took
place while the man was undergoing a
sentence of imprisonment on the Penelope
for striking a chief stoker. A "medical
survey" was first held on the accused,
which presumably resulted in a finding
that he had been shamming sickness. On
this a board of three officers sentenced
the man to eighteen lashes. "After re
ceiving eleven lashes," said the report,
"the prisoner became insensible, and the
medical officer present (the staff surgeon,
of the Monarch) stopped the cruel pro
ceeding, and the wretched man was borne
bleeding and senseless to his cell." There
does not appear, therefore, to be any sug
gestion that he was malingering this time.
The Western Morning News, in chron
icling this Incident, expresses the hope
that it may lead to a renewed agitation
for the abolition of flogging in the navy.
I can hardly conceive it possible that any
one possessed of ordlnarv human feeling
will fall to Join in this hope. As to the
desirability of corporal punishment,
whether In the navy or elsewhere, for
certain peculiarly brutal classes of crime,
opinion may differ. But the idea of flog
ging a man senseless for such a trumpery
offense as that of pretended sickness In
order to evade prison discipline is revolt-
Ing to the most elementary feelings of Jus
tice and humanity. The reader will note
that this poor wretch was sentenced (by
three officers commanding her Majesty's
ships and with the approval of the com
mander in chief on the station) to receive
eighteen lashes, and what that punish
ment would have meant had it been car
ried out may be judged from the fact that
the man had become senseless from pain
and a medical officer had to interfere be
fore two-thirds of the sentence had been
executed. Such a result,- considered in
conjunction with the paltry character of
the "crime" for which this murderous
penalty was imposed, should convince
every one of the utter unfltness of many
of our naval officers to be intrusted with
such powers over their subordinates.â-

REALTY MARKET IS ACTIVE.
THE purchase by the Mutual Savings
Bank of a large slice of the Blythe
block on Market street Is the all
absorbing topic in real estate cir
cles. The transaction Is regarded
as second In Importance only to the recent
sale of the Baldwin hotel site and the fact
that splendid modern buildings are to be
erected on both sites will have an imme
diate effect on the value of neighboring
property along the street. Mrs. Florence
Blythe-Moore will also erect a fine large
building on her Market street property.
It will not probably go up alongside the
proposed bank building, as it Is under
stood that she Intends to dispose of the
remainder of her interest on that side of
BrookÃ street. She wil retain, however,
the valuable piece of property on the
northeast side of Brooks and Market
| streets, extending through to Geary
I street and nearly up to O'Farrell. The
j comparatively small piece of property
i that forms the gore at the end of the block
Is held $150,000, and it is not Improbable
! that sooner or later It may become a
j part of the Blythe estate. It waa this
' piece of property on the northeast corner
of Market street and the alley (Brooks
street) which was first desired by the
Mutual Savings Bank. Mayor Phelan. as
president of that Institution, offered $300.
l 000 for It, but his offer was not accepted,
> the price at which It was held being $341,
j 000. The property which was finally se
i cured by the bank consists of the two
| most easterly lota extending to within 37
Â¦ feet of Kearny street, having a frontage
'of &3 3-S feet on Market, 73:10Â» 4 feet on
Geary, 50.0CU feet on the east line (depth;
and il feet on the west and southwesterly
side, which is elbow shaped.
The exact price paid for this property
was 52&0.U00 and the sale, which was nego
tiated by Thomas Magee & Sons, occupied
eleven months in perfecting. It was an
extremely tedious and trying proceeding,
because of the great number of conflicting
interests and claims against the property,
I to say nothing of the clouds on the title
i which had to be cleared away. To quote '
! Thomas Magee: "Job. himself, with all
i his patience, would have given up the
Job. But, although this Is said to be an
! Impatient age, real estate brokers are not
I prone to give up anything that gives the
i faintest promise of success, and the deal
1 went through. The success of the nego
i tiations, however, was largely due to the
! energy and ability of Attorney Walter J.
j Bartnett. who cleared away all the legal
! entanglements, brought the wrangling
! lawyers with claims against the estate in
to line and paved the way for the passing
of the deed. The lawyers made the most
trouble. They wanted at first to dispose
of 90 per cent of the title, but were finally
forced to recede from this position. Mr.
MageÂ« declared yesterday that there
never was a sale made where there were
so many things to nx up. "Â¦
I Mrs. Blythe-Moore was practically
I forced to sell the property to satisfy the
demands of the lawyers, and because of
this fact the price is less than the prop
erty would have brounght under more
favorable circumstances. Thomas Ma
cee & Sons appraised the same prop
! erty on December 11, 1596, at $303,500. But
! the remaining portion of the Blythe
i block is now practically clear of debt,
! and an Eastern title and trust company
! has agreed to loan $1,000,000 on it at 5
i per cent Interest net. This money, or a
! portion of it, will be used to pay off the
i mortgages, and the remainder will go
I into the new buildings that are to be
j erected on the site.
Thomas Magee & Sons have also sold
for L. Kauffman tha property on the
southwest corner of O'Farrell and Car
los streets, between Powell and Mason
streets. The buyer, whose name is not
disclosed, pays $90,000 in cash, and will
finish the fine building that is in course
of construction on the site. This work
will entail an additional expenditure Of
about $40,000, so that his investment will
approximate $130,000.
The old observatory building on Tele
graph Hill and the lot, which Is but
thirty-four feet less than fifty varas In
size, has been sold by Charles Sutro to
Gray Bros. The property Is on the north
fast corner of Kearny and Greenwich
I streets. The building, which -originally
cost $27,000, will be remodeled and fitted
i up as an apartment house for the ftc
< commodation of the employes of its new
1 owners. The price paid is said to be In
the neighborhood of $6000.
Lyon & Hoag have purchased from the
San Francisco Savings Union a tract of
land in Berkeley containing about 200
I lots, which they will immediately im
i prove and place on the market In subdi
i visions. The improvements contemplated
i Include the grading of the land and the
opening of new streets. The land faces
jon University avenue and Sacramento
i street, on both of which streets is a car
I line. The price paid was about $15,000.
Eastern; Eldrtdge & Co. will hold a reg-
I ular auction sale of city property on

PACIFIC UNION
CLUB LOSES A
LEADING MEMBER
Death of Capitalist
Joseph Clark.
WAS A PIONEER MINING MAN
HE HELPED TO MATTE BONANZA
DAYS FAMOUS.
Had BÂ«Â«n Suffering Several Weeks
From a Complication of Troubles
Which He Was Unable to
\ Shake Off.
The Pacific Union Club lost one of Its
bent known, oldest and most popular
members this morning through the death
of Joseph Clark, the pioneer mining man.
who expired in his apartments at the club
at 12:20 a. m. at the ripe age of 72.
Mr. Clark was one of the State's old
timers who with men, many of whose
names have now become historical, de
veloped the mineral resources of the coun
try and made ."bonanza days" the golden
era of California's prosperity and the
theme for future generations to dwell
upon with wonder and delight.
Many years ago Mr. Clark retired from
active business and occupied his time in
resting from the effects of the hard labor
of his early youth and attending to the
property which that labor had brought
him. He was a member of the Pacific
Union Club almost from its very forma
tion, and his home was within Its "portals.
There he spent most of his leisure, read
ing, receiving friends and recalling events
of early dayÃ with cronies who had passed
through them with him.
Some four or five weeks ago the old gen
tleman was taken 11] with a complication
of troubles which, at his advanced age,
he waa unable to shake off, not having
the vitality of a younger man to bring to
the aid of the physician. Notwithstand
ing this his death was not expected,
though he was known to be a very sick
man, and the utmost vigilance was exer
cised in procuring for him all that science
could suggest or money buy. He waa
thought. to be Improving under the care
that was bestowed on him, and hla sud
den death this morning will consequently
come in the nature of a surprise to the
many friends who were looking forward
to his recovery in the near future.
The deceased was a near relative of Mrs.
Phebe Hearst and an uncle of Edward
H. Clark, manager of the Hearst estate.
As yet no arrangements have been made
for the funeral, as the hour of death pre
cluded any but the most necessary for
malities being arranged for.
Mr. Clark was a very wealthy man, and
leaves a fortune which consists of various
mining, real estate and other valuable
holding^ He was a great friend of the
late R. S. McMurray, the millionaire min
ing man and banker, who died a short
time ago at his residence on Pacific ave
nue. â¢
The owner of the mine had brought some
specimens down to this city to show
Saray. who was now onhls way to in
spect them. Would not Mr.^ Scott like to
accompany him and also look at them?
Mr. Scott was rather curious to see
Btove metal which was of more value than
gold. He said he would.
The stranger took Scott to a building in
the 300 block on Sutter street, w here they
climbed a flight of stairs and entered la
room on the second floor. In the 'room
were seated two other men who were in
troduced to Scott by names he does not
now remember.
Samy Inquired If the specimen man had
vet put In an appearance and was in
formed that he had not yet â¢ cÂ° me - t b "^!J a ?
expected any minute. The four sat around
quietly conversing for a few minxes,
when one of the two Â° ri e lna ' s Â®{!; 1 !â¢
pulled a paper off the table, uncovering a
pack of cards and some poker chip? that
had been hidden underneath. He explained
that he and his friend had been whiling
away the time with a quiet game i or
poker and, fearing that Samy and Scott
might have been accompanied by ladles,
they had hurriedly hidden the instruments
of their iniquity. As no ladies had ap
peared they would continue the game.
They started to play, while Samy and
Scott sat looking on. Finally Samy asked
to be allowed to sit In and. after some
hesitancy, the others made a place for
him. He was soon winning everything In
sight and. wishing Scott to participate In
his good fortune, urged that gentleman to
either take a hand or back his play.
But by this time the Australian had
come out of his trance. Holding his purse
in one hand and his watch In the other,
he Informed the trio he was on to their
game and then hurriedly fled without
waiting to argue the matter any further.
That was the last of the matter so far
as Scott was concerned. The sharpers,
however, were still looking for a good
thing. The next morning Davis, while
standing at the door of the Occidental,
was approached by one of the same gang,
who tried to get him to go up the street
and Inspect a machine for the manufac
ture of artificial feathers. Davis declined
the tempting offer, whereupon the cheer
ful worker departed.
For some reason or other the Occidental
seems to be the Mecca of these fellows.
This Is only one of a number of such cases
that have occurred In which' Its guests
have been the central figure, and all of
them have not come off as cheaply as did
Scott.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1900.
SEEKING TO CREATE
A MURDER MYSTERY
COEONEK HILL INVESTIGATES
SLACK'S SUICIDE.
Witnesses Add No New Evidence to
the Facts of the Young Man's
Self-Destruction as Al
ready Published.
Coroner Hill attempted yesterday to
make a murder mystery out of the suicld*
of Ellard D. Slack, the youngr man who in
a fit of despondency shot a bullet into hla
brain. The Coroner insisted that the trag
edy was not clearly explained, and he or
dered an Investigation, which was begun
yesterday morning and will probably bÂ»
concluded thta afternoon. The Inquiry de
veloped nothing new. The witnesses w^o
were summoned and testified related th^
facts as they have already been published.
Slack entered the ealoon where he com
mitted his tragic act. and going to the
card room fired a bullet into his brain.
He was apparently sober and spoke
pleasantly to one or two men that he
knew and recognized in the place. The
witnesses who testified yesterday knew
nothing more than this. Drs. Dray and
Zabala gave- formal evidence In regard to
the character of thÂ» wounds, and testified
particularly that It was perfectly possible
for the young man to have innictea tnem
upon himself. Â¦â¢ , _,
Subpenas had bÂ«en Issued for J. Slmor.3
and Harry de Oreayer two Intimate
friends of the suicide. Neither of thesa
men appeared, and by the Coroner's order
an attachment was issued. A request was
also made upon the police authorities to
make an Investigation Neither D^
Greayer nor Slmona will be able to shed
any new light upon the tragedy. They
know that Black had been living beyond
his means and In a fit of despondency tocic
his own life. By what process of reason
ing the Coroner has arrived at the sus
picion cf murder nobody has been ablo to
ascertain. He has called the resumption
of the inquest for 2 o'clock this afternoon.

City Attorney Explains Certain Pro
visions of the Charter.
City and County Attorney Lane yes
terday addressed a communication to
Sheriff-elect Lackmann, in which he ex
plains certain Bpeclfied Incongruities in
the new charter respecting the paying of
all fees Into the city treasury. After
enumerating the several sections referring
to the subject, Mr. "L-ane advises as fol
lows:
It will be MÂ«n by close reading of these pro
visions that they wer* drafted with one pur
pose, to aecure to the city treasury all the fees
or compensation for official service which may
be recelvÂ«d by any publlo officer other than his
Mt-Isry.
The conclusion reached Is this: Whenever
any officer, deputy, assistant, clerk or em
ploye receives compensation tor any official
service the same must fro Into the treasury and
become & r> art ot the unapportloned fee fund.
Whenever any such person receives money
which, according to law, hÂ« must expend in the
course -of his duty and which does not consti
tute any part of any fee or compensation for
sen-ice rendered, said money does not go into
the treasury and become part of euch fond.

"To my surprise, I discovered that
the coffee habit was fixed upon me. and
I looked forward to the beverage at

fact that my free, independent man-

"My heart gradually became weaker

that my feet and hands were always
cold, except immediately after drinking
coffee; and after the effect of the cof-

"When I awakened to ray condition
I quit the coffee and took up Postum

palatable and perfect beverage. My
heart has recovered Its normal
Ftrecgrth and I am again a young and
healthy man. It is very plain to me
now that coffee was robbing me of my
strength and vigor. Postum helped me
yuit and buiJt up my nervous system.

PHELAN HARRIED BY A
CLAN OF JOB CHASERS
Adroit Plans of the Mayor to
Elude His Angry Pursuers,
In Secret Conference District Leaders of
the Democratic Organization Appoint
a Chasing Committee of Five.
IT was a conference sub rosa to talk
about the distribution of patronage to
the districts and to appoint a com
mittee of five to wait on Mayor
Phelan."
The foregoing sentence was spoken by
one of the district leaders of the Reform
Democracy, with a reference to a secret
meeting of patronage-loving statesmen at
Native Sons' Hall last Wednesday even-
Ing.
In describing the character and scope
of the conference the Democratic district
leader remarked:
"There was no actual outburst of In
dignation, but the anxiety was so pro
found that angry protests were feared.
Jasper McDonald was present and told
the district committeemen that Mayor
Phelan intended that the Democratic or
ganization'should be recognized."
Jasper McDonald, tho chairman of the
Reform Democrat', was asked last even-
Ing if it were true that the Mayor had
promised to look out for the organization
In the award of patronage. Mr. McDon
ald said he could not spealt for the Mayor,
but he ventured the presumption that the
Assembly districts would be considered
in the distribution of official favors.
Park Commissioner McDonald failed to
convey to The Call desired Information
regarding the proceedings of the sub rosa
conference. It was his recollection that
a committee was appointed to see the
Mayor,, but he was not advised whether
the committee had seen Mr. Phelan.
From modern and enlightened sources
within the domain of regenerated Democ
racy The Call ascertains definitely that
a committee was appointed to wait on the
Mayor. Moreover, M. C. Hassett of thÂ»
Fortieth Assembly District was desig
nated chairman of the committee.
"Among those present" at the conference
were: R. V. Whiting, M. C. Hassett, John
H. Grady, John F. Tyler, Jasper McDon

XIH. THE DINING-ROOM.
BY MISS ANNE BARROWS.
The dining-room should stand for social
life for the family as well as Its guests,
since there are many households where
the Individual members rarely meet ex
cept at meal time. The end and aim of
our table service, therefore, should be to
further the social life rather than to cater
to epicures or display costly furnishings
or make a display of the latest fads In
table service. The fashion of the furni
ture of the dining-room and the style of
service are of less importance than the
ease and comfort of every individual con
cerned. A meal may be eaten In the
kitchen when necessary and yet all the
laws of good breeding be observed, while
even in elegant dining-rooms meals are
not always served decently and in order.
Few of us can build our houses and de
cide upon the location of the dining-room,
the number of windows it shall have and
the point of compass that they shall far*.
Probably fewer yet can follow the sun
and serve each meal In a different room.
Light Is essential, but If either room must
be in a dark corner of the house let it be
the dining-room rather than the kitchen.
Artificial light will make the dining-room
cheerful, but the commonest processes of
the kitchen need the full sunlight to in
sure perfect cleanness. If the outlook
from the dining-room Is not pleasant, col
ored glass windows are a possible remedy.
The separation of dining-room and
kitchen Is supposed to have been a con
cession to the esthetic nature of the hu
man being and to Indicate an advance In
civilization. But succeeding generations
may find it possible to reunite the kitchen
and dining-room under different conditions
from those of the past. Straws that show
which way the current sets are the favor
Bhown the chafing dish and the gradual
Introduction of the gas stove, the Alad
din oven and electrical appliances for
cookery. Any of these means of cooking
food might properly be installed in an al
cove of the dining-room.
The modern Idea of higher civilization is
not to move away from unsightly sur
roundings, but to Improve them, removing
the disagreeable features. Much is said
about co-operative housekeeping, and con
servative men and women object to the
plan, forgetting how many processes have
been put outside the individual home since
the days of our grandmothers. Many
would be ready to give up the Individual
kitchen, but would wish to retain the fam
ily dining-room. This might be done In
many households to-day were we willing
to simplify our manner of living and do a
little more work with our own hands.
The first requisite for comfort at meal
time Is that the dining-room shall be well
aired. Air Is as essential as food, and In
deed should be considered one of our
most important foods. We are afraid of
odors from the kitchen, and yet even a
fresh smell of frying Is less disagreeable
than the stale, close odor of an unalred
room. It is not wise to shut up a dining
room after a meal without first airing
It. The removal of bad air should be at
tended to as regularly as thÂ© gathering
up of crumbs.
Excessive heat Is a common fault In the
dining room. When hot foods and drinks
form the main part of a meal the temper
ature of the room should be lower than
that of the usual living rooms. Therefore
let the windows be open for a few min
utes Just before the meal to change the
air thoroughly and then close them that
there shall be no draft. An open fireplace
Is an excellent means of ventilation and
may be depended upon for heating a din
ing room except In the coldest weather.
The location, size and shape of the dining
room should be carefully considered when
deciding upon its furnishings. In general,
light colors, the softer yellows and
browns, are satisfactory for the paper
and woodwork. Corner closets, with glass
doors above, should be put In wherever it
is possible. They afford a safe resting
place for tha choicer pieces of tableware
and add greatly to the decoration of the
room. A hardwood floor with a large rug
that is not too difflcult to keep clean, sim
ple draperies. If any, at the windows, and
furniture that Is graceful, strong and not
ornate are the essentials for the dining
room. Decorations should be few: a bay
window full of plants and the corner clos
ets or sideboard with some pieces of hand
some china are usually sufficient. Uphol
stery is not desirable for dining-room fur
niture, though leather covers may be ad
missible. Hardwood without elaborate
carving Is the best for table and chairs;
the latter should be well shaped and those
without arms are usually preferred. Cane
seats are not as durable, but rather easier
than hardwood.
The round and square table each have
their admirers; something depends on the
shape of the room. Where the room Is
email, with a bay window at one end,
space may be saved by choosing a table
with oval ends. A narrow table Is never
satisfactory, nor should one be so broad
that the center is not easily reached from
the side. The relative height of chairs
and table should be adjusted carefully.
Footstools provided for the shorter per
sons will add much to their comfort.
Where there Is a chandelier in the dining
room the center of the table should come
under that. The table should be large
enough to give a space of at least two
feet to each person. Where there Is a
hardwood floor rubber tips on the chairs
are essential, and there should be strong
enough casters on the table, wherever It
Is, to admit of moving it easily. Every
article of furniture In the dlntnsr room
may come In contact with foods, and
hence In shape and substance should be
such as can easily be kept clean.
This should also be kept in mind when
choosing the tableware, be It china, glass
or silver. Perfect cleanness Is the first
essential, and It Is almost Impossible to
attain this with the intricate folds In the
china, the filigree of the silver and the
deep cuts In glass. That dishes are clean
should - be apparent to sight as well as
touch. Pood shows to better advantage
in most cases on plain dishes. China with
high-colored patterns becomes monoton
ous unless we have a variety of sets. In
the average household It is more satis
factory to have a set of dishes plain white
and gain variety through the usa of odd
pieces. It is not wise to buy all the
novelties, for no sooner do we become
accustomed to the use of a new article
than it goes out of fashion. This Is il
lustrated by the ups and downs in salt
cellars and salt shakers, bone dishes, in
dividual vegetable dishes, water carafes
and the like.
The table linen likewise should be of
white for general use and should be se
lected from standard patterns, with nap
kins to match. There should be an abun
dant supply of tablecloths of different
sizes, that it may not be necessary to
fold one under or to use two as the table
Is made smaller or larger. Center pieces,
carving cloths and dollies are more satis
factory In the end where the ornamenta
tion is drawn work or plain white em
broidery rather than high colors; the lat
ter are sure to Interfere with the flowers
or other table decorations which we want
to use. The omission of the tablecloth al
together and the usÂ» of dollies on the
polished table is a fashion which holds in
favor. Where the table pad la used,
whether It be felt, quilting or of the knit
ted variety. It should not be so thick that
the impression of each dish remains after
It Is taken up. Tablecloth ami napkins
should be Ironed with as few folds as pos
sible, and the elaborate arrangement of
napkins la not considered in the be3t taste,
as it sugerests too much handling. Many
dinner napkins are absurdly large and the
use of them seems to Imply a doubt as to
the table habits of our guests.
Ribbons, if used at alt. should be care
fully placed, for nothing is mor%,dlsturb
ing than to see a grease spot appear on
an elegant ribbon In the midst of dinner.
Style of Service.
What Mrs. A. may do with six servants
Mrs. B. cannot do with one. and Mrs. C.
who keeps no maid, should not try to Imi
tate either of her neighbors. To serve a
meal of several courses requires the whole
attention of one maid, and she cannot
well be cook also. Whatever our style of
living, everything should be carefully
planned In advance, that the machinery of
service may be Invisible and noiseless.
Children should be taught to serve well
and to wait upon the table In place of a
maid when It Is necessary. With a side
board and a two-story table on casters
the hostess may remove one course and
substitute another with little effort.
Where the service la elaborate It Is
often cumbersome to have all the silver
for individual use put in place at the be
ginning. In such cases it Is desirable to
serve the hostess first, that by her own
use she may Indicate the proper fork or
spoon to be used for each course. A safe
general rule for table service Is to place
everything ready for use Pasg at the ieft
the dishes to which the person helps him
self, but place individual portions, such
as the plate of soup or cup of coffee, at
the right hand. Before serving another
course everything relating to the one pre
ceding should be rejnoved; ordinarily tha
soiled dishes before each individual are
removed at the left hand.
A simple dinner consists of three
courses â soup, roast and dessert. The
same foundation is retained for more
elaborate menus, but other courses aro
placed between these principal ones:
Relish.
Soup.
Fish.
Roast.
Salad.
Dessert.
Coffee.
Some housekeepers seem to care movÂ«
for the form and ceremony of a meal than
they do for the quality of the food? which,
are served. To save the trouble of carv
ing and apportioning the different courses
service a la Russe Is very popular, and to
this perhaps we owe the popularity of
small molds and individual portions, even
when a dish Is served at the table. Gar
nishes should be simple and edible; there
is a tendency toward excessive garnlsa
sometimes seen which Is really tawdry
and interferes with tha best appearance
of the food itself.
Courses should offer a contrast both In,
appearance and flavor; brown and white
effects should alternate. In family life,
where the meat is especially substantial,
like roast goose or pork, the vegetables
and dessert should be carefully selected
to balance this. On the other hand, if
fish takes the place of meat the dessert
may be more substantial.
The housekeeper who would preserve a
well balanced style of life for herself, her
maids, her family and guests should oc
casionally ask herself such questions as
these:
Is the furniture In the dining room
placed with reference to the saving of
steps?
Are dishes and their contents selected
with reference to fashion, or to tha real
needs and comfort of the household?
What is the standard of table service,
comfort or fashion?
Is there danger that the method of
serving food is absorbing more of your
attention than the Quality of tho food It
self?

AFTER DR. GARDNER'S SCALP.
Gage Wants to Make Dr. Dozier Su
perintendent at Napa.
The habeas corpus case of Hugh
Buchanan still occupies the attention of
the Justices of the Supreme Court. It also
Is bringing to the front the apparent fact
that Governor Gage Is Interested In oust
ing Dr. A. M. Gardner, superintendent of
the Napa Asylum for the Insajie. In order
to give his friend Dr. L.. F. Dozler the
place. It will be remembered that Buchan
an killed a man in Marysville four years
ago, and during hi 3 trial It developed that
he was insane, for so a number of the
beat medical experts of the State testified
at the time. He was sent to Napa. from
which asylum his friends and other in
terested parties seek to have him released,
claiming that he is sane and that Dr.
Gardner is illegally restraining him of hJs
liberty. If this could be proved tr> thÂ©
satisfaction of the Justices Dr. Gardner's
tenure of office would be short.
At the examination yesterday Dr. J. W.
Robertson testified that the man is in
sane, and he was substantiated by other
eminent experts on mental diseases. Dr.
Dozier, the first assistant superintendent
at the asylum, claiming to be an expert
on such matters, declared that Buchanan
is sane. Dr. Dozler and his superior, so it
Is well understood, are "at outs." not even
consulting about the cases In their charge.
It is also conceded that Dr. Dozier Is very
friendly with Governor Gage, and that if
Dr. Gardner could be ousted Dozier would
be promoted to the first position. Hence
the difference of "opinions" between tha
two doctors at the asylum as to Buchan
an's sanity. The case goes on again Tues
day, when Dr. Gardner will give his views
on the petitioner's sanity.

WEBSTER DOES
NOT AGREE WITH
NEW OFFICIALS
Deputies' Salaries in
Controversy.
DENMAN BEHIND TROUBLE
The economical plans of School Dlrec
tor-to-be James Denman have set the In
coming Board of Education up against
Superintendent Webster, and the row that
Is on between the two branches of the
city's educational department is a merry
one. Denman has publicly announced
that he considers $150 per month enough
salary for any of the deputies Webster
proposes to appoint. About all they will
have to do, according to Mr. Denman, Is
visit the schools daily and make monthly
or bi-monthly reports, and he does not
see why they should command higher pay
than the average principal of a grammar
school.
Superintendent Webster, to use the par
lance of the day, says Mr. Denman is a
"lobster" and ought to have been out of
the school business the day he entered it.
Also he says he will not demean himself
by asking any one to work as his deputy
for a paltry hundred and a half, ana he
is demanding of the new board that It fix
the monthly stipend at Just $100 more.
Webster Borne time ago proffered three of
his four deputyships to L. A. Jordan, his
present assistant; W. A. Kingsbury and
C. L. Walker. At that time it was fig
ured that the salary would be $250 a
month, and all of the three promptly ac
cepted. k
Then Denman made known his economi
cal tendency and Kingsbury and Walker
promptly declined to serve for any such
amount. Jordan as promptly accepted.
Webster took up the fight and has an
nounced that unless the salaries are fixed
at at least $200 a month he will not make
an appointment and the School Depart
ment will have to do without deputies and
shoulder the responsibility. The board
will, hold a quiet little caucus this after
noon, and it is the intention of Webster
to appear before it and make formal de
mand for $250 a month, with an alterna
tive compromise of $200. If he fails on
both figures he will give official notice
that he will make no appointments and
will leave that matter solely with the
board.
Director Cecil Mark Is already at
swords' points with two of the new mem
bers. When they met the other day to
draw lots for the long and short terms
Mark got the two-year term and Mrs.
Mary Klncald got the one-year slip. Mark
did some quick figuring and after a painful
few minutes gallantly offered to exchange
with Mrs. Klncald. That lady at first re
fused to accept, but upon pressure by
Mark finally succumbed and exchanged!
Now Mrs. Klncaid's friends are sore for
the reason that they are of the opinion
that Mark wanted the short term because
Mayor Phelan will have the appointment
of his successor, and he figures upon get
ting the appointment. At the end of the
first year the short term Director will be
succeeded by himself, or another, for a
term of four years. The first year will
end under Mayor Phelan's administration,
and Mark figures that he Is strong enough
to pick the plum, and his confreres say he
was figuring on five years in office when
he urged Mrs. Kincaid to exchange. The
Mayor Is hoping, however, that to-day's
little caucus will heal all dissensions and
Sut the new board on a smooth running
asls.
The new Fire Commission has had sev
eral quiet meetings during the past few
days, and it is practically settled that
George Maxwell, v the present secretary,
shall succeed himself. Mr. Maxwell has
been an excellent and efficient officer, and
notwithstanding that the "organization"
is said to have promised his place to F. B.
Perkins, the deputy County Treasurer,
three of the commission are with Max
well, and that is enough to elect him.
Mayor Phelan. accompanied by his at
torney, Daniel Murphy, visited the health
office at noon yesterday and expressed a
desire to see one of the members of the
Health Board. Health Officer Lawlor told
the Mayor that none of the members were
present, and the latter remarked that he
presumed that the published stories to the
effect that the Health Board would refuse
to surrender their offices were untrue.
Dr. Lawlor replied that the intention of
the board which he served was simply tÂ«
retain possession until a grave question
of law had been decided by the courts.
Upon the Mayor asking for information
on this point Bookkeeper Edward Niles,
who has studied up the matter, answered:
"Section 19 of the constitution of the
State holds that the Legislature must pro
vide sanitary protection in all cities and
counties."
Attorney Murphy claimed that the char
ter repealed all Legislative enactments,
but Kilos answered that the charter was
in direct conflict with the constitution,
and the proposition would have to be set
tled on these lines.
Later the Mayor stated that he would
meet the Board of Health at Its session
to-day at noon and ascertain If some set
tlement could not be made.
ference with the Indignant committÂ«emen
from the districts. It is further told that
the committeemen who attended the secret
meeting became hysterical In their anx
iety. They refused to accept the general
statement of Jasper McDonald that Mayor
Phejan intended to recognize the organiza
tion, but resolved that a committee should
see the Mayor and demand such recogni
tion. The committee was directed to make
a report to the district leaders at some
time not later than Saturday, January
6, 1900.
As the Reform Democrats, with the as
sistance of weak-ln-the-splne Republi
cans, carried every Assembly district In
San Francisco for Mayor Phelan, every
district is entitled to recognition. States
men of Democratic faith will not listen to
the Phelan plaint that there is no pie in
the new charter. They hold that the pie
is big enough to go round if the cor
morants north of Market street are
clubbed away from the counter.
Before the election many of the Demo
cratic statesmen who assembled last
"Wednesday night at Native Sons' Hall
were spoken of derisively as Job-chasers.
They went into the fight for progressive
government and fat offices, with Mayor
Phelan on the pie wagon at the head of
the column, and now they propose that
their young and brilliant leader shall ap
portion the spoils of conquest. Whatever
the followers of Phelan were In theory
before election, it is plain now that they
are job-chasers In practice. The Mayor
cannot dodge Hassett's committee by re
treating to the Pacific-Union Club or tak
ing shelter under the wings of the owl at
the Bohemian. Tho members of the com
mittee are out for the promised Jobs, and
are prepared to pursue the Mayor to the
platform of the proposed pro-Boer meet-
Ing. Phelan, indeed, is hard pressed. His
people at home are clamoring for office,
and from far away South Africa comes
the cry from Hearst, "Esola must be ap
pointed Chief of Police."
In yesterday's Call Charles Fay was
given credit for having an ambition to be
appointed secretary of the new Park Com
mission. This was an error. It is Phil
Fay, Charlie's brother, who aspires for
the plum. Charles will remain as he isâ
Mayor Phelan's confidential secretary and
right-hand man.
Securities and Interest Money Driven Away
by Bad System.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1900.
QUESTIONS OF OUR CITY'S GOVERNMENT
TAXING ITS OWN BONDS
ROBS STATE OF WEALTH
Millions Are Wasted Every Decade to Enrich Bond
Bayers of the East on Whom Golden
Showers Descend.
"tT JS T iit.fi the bonds recently authorized by the city and
Â»i\ I county of San Francisco are issued there -will be upward
of $15,000,000 of the bonds â State, county and munic
ipal â representing the people of the State of California, which will,
as the Btate constitution now stands, pay interest principally to
the Eastern buyers of bonds, tho tax upon them crowding them out
of this State and preventing the savings banks from holding
them. This condition compels the taxpayers to raise more money
In taxes to pay interest on the bonds than would be the case if the
bonds were not taxable; also a steady drain on the resources of the
Btate goes on, and, in addition, the purpose of the tax is largely de
feated by persons who, taking the bonds out of the State, are able
to conceal them and so evade taxation. San Francisco is interested
to the extent of over $11,000,000.
'TN many quarters there are indications
! I that a strong movement will be made
I in support of the proposed constitu
r tional amendment in this State which
?JÂ«rovKse* that all bonds hereafter issued
fby the State of California, or by any
â¢county, municipal corporation or district,
"including school, reclamation and irriga
|tlon districts, within the commonwealth,
f hall be free and exempt from taxation.
This is proposed as a new section of ar
licle XIII of the constitution. It will be
Voted upon at the November election.
Tne Merchants Association of San
Francisco, the Bank Commissioners, the
officers and directors of savings banks in
this city and In other parts of the State
end ilaj or Phelan are among those who
are earnestly urging the doing away with
taxation upon all State, county and muni
cipal bonds. The general argument ad
vanced in favor of the exemption from
taxation of the classes of bonds enumer
ated is that the tax drives the securities
cut of the State, and that, as a conse
quence, there is a continual and wholly
Unnecessary drain upon tha State to pay
Interest money to the foreign holders of
the bonds.
The followlns argument has also been
tiscd: California bonds, being sold abroad,
have their value determined by the esti
mation in which they axe held where they
tre best known. 1 here being no large
home market for California bonds, they
Co not enjoy as good credit as the bonda
cf Eastern Statts. To make bonds at
tractive to purchasers in this State, and
fco keej> them at home, there must be
&dded to a. fair rats of Interest at least
the average rate of taxation. Conse
quently the rate upon all State, county
und municipal bones Issued in this State
eince 157S>. for interest, has been at least 1
l>er cent higher than it would have been
had not the bonds been subject to taxa
tion.
it has bepn treed tli.it tho tar hns An-
it nas Deen urgea uiat tne tax has de
feated itself. "Not one-fourth of this
extra 1 per cent in interest," said Lovell
White, in an address to bankers some
time ago, "has been recovered in taxes
jÂ«Ud on the bonds, and the small amount
*>r> realized, or at least I*7 per cent of It.
Instead of finding its way to the counties
and municipalities ihat paid the extra in
lerest, goes Into the treasury of the city
fend county of San Francisco, thereby
l-obbing Peter, who is supposed to be rela
tively poor, of a very large sum to pay
& very email amount to Paul, who is com
iiaratively in eaay circumstances."
A circular letter has been addressed by
lhe editor of The Call to the appropriate
officers of the several counties and muni
cipalities of the State to ascertain the
tanount. &s nearly as possible, that an
r.ually goes out of the State in payment
>cf the interest on the State, county and
tnunlcipal bonds. The general conclusion
Its that, counting In ,the bonds that this
city and county has Just voted, which
amount to over $11,0'Â»,000, the Interest on
Il6.twO.VjO is about to -low out of the State
on account of the bonds described before.
The large bond issues of this city and
county *ust voted have awakened much
Sresttjer attention In regard to this matter
than had previously been manifested.
The community next to San Francisco
most interested in the payment of Interest
on municipal bonds is Ivos Angeles. Ac
cording tv the latest official returns the
net bonded debt of Los Angeles is about
$1,572,000. The bonds represented In this
total were 4 p*r cents, 4Vfc per cents and 5
per cents, with the exception of a small
old lspue amounting to $SOOO on which the
interest rate is 7 per cent. Practically all
this interest money goes out of the State.
There is no doubt that all the interest
en the new bond issues of San Franclrco
â¢will also go out of the State under the
existing conditions. The rates of interest
on the San Francisco issues of latest
authorization are: On the improvement
bonds, 3 per cent; on the park extension
bonds, 34 per cent. The lowest State and
county tax would not fall under V-/Â» per
cent. This would not let the California
holder of the bonds get over 2 per cent
net on the higher interest bonds and lty
per cent on the lower interest bearing
ones. No savings bank would hold them,
because the banks are compelled to make
several reports per annum to the Bank
Commissioners showing up all their assets
and other items of material concern, and
the bonds could not escape taxation while
in the hands of the banks.
The responses to the circular letter sent
out by the editor of The Call were qu'tÂ«
general. The answers In several instances
illustrated the fact that It is very difficult
to locate the bonds after they have been
sold. The holders, wherever they are,
dodge the payment of the tax. If they
are In the East they find evasion easy.
Some time ago a plan was proposed by
Professor Plehn of the State Lniverslty
to deduct the tax from the Interest be
fore the interest was paid to the bond
holder, and he had an idea that this would
reach the foreign holder as well as the
owner of bonds at home. This plan has
never been adopted. Where many of the
bonds of the State, counties and munici
palities are no one is able to say. This
has made it difflcult for the county and
municipal officials, when answering the
queries of The Call, to give definite in
formation.
Some of the larger amounts of bonds
of the classes referred to that are held
outside of the State and draw Interest out
of the State are as follows: Kern County,
$225.00}, purchased In Chicago, interest
rate *\i per cent; city of Alameda, $51,000,
held in New York; Hanford, Kings Coun
ty, $2^,000, held in New York; Santa Rosa,
$240, w0, held in New York; Santa Barbara,
$45,O>>\ held in Chicago and Denver, draw-
Ing 5 per cent interest: Woodland, $78,000,
sold to Rollins & Co.; Watsonvllle, $40,000;
Marysvllle, $25,000; Lakeport, $15,400; Napa
City, $17,500, at 5 per cent:" Nevada City,
$60,u00; Pasadena, $7a,676; Qulncy. Plumas
County, $35,100: Redlands, 165,000; Redwood
City. Ktf.GOu ; Salinas, $C 8,000; San Bernar
dino, $$0,000; San Diego, $2b3,000; San Luis
Obispo, $116,000.
There are other communltiea in the
State having quite large sums outstand
ing in bonds, but from these no Informa
tion has been definitely received as to
where the interest is paid. The State has
$400,000 of the ferry bonds, issued to raise
the money for the ferry building, that are
held abroad. Concerning these Controller
Colgan writes: "All State bonds, with
the exception of San Francisco depot
bonds, amounting to $400,000, are held by
the State Treasurer In trust for the
schools and the university. These are as
follows: In trust for the school fund,
funded debt bonds of 1573, $1,626,500; San
Francisco depot bonds, $200,000. In trust
for the university, funded debt bonds of
1573, $751,000. The remaining depot bonds,
amounting to $400,000, were originally held
by Farson, Leech & Co. of Chicago, but
by whom they are held now I cannot cay.
They bear Interest at 4 per cent. The
funded debt bonds bear 6 per cent Inter
est. The county of Sacramento has a
bonded indebtedness of $429,000, of which
the State holds $323,000 In the school fund
The Bond Commissioners of the city of
Sacramento hold $77,000, and the balance
of $Â£< 500 is held in San Francisco."
Redlands is paying annually to New
York parties the sum of $2900 for interest
on its bonds; Riverside Is paying 5 per
cent on $117,000. The annual interest paid
by San Diego outside of the State is $13,
207. Ban Luis Obispo sends away 5 per
cent on $116,000 annually. The municipal
bonds of Stockton amount to $192,250.
Where the interest is paid does not appear
by the answers received. Uklah sends
$2400 out of the State for interest annu
ally; WatÃonvllle sends 5 per cent on $40,
000 to New Jersey; Woodland sends 6 per
cent of $78,000 to Boston. The largest
amount to be paid out annually to foreign
holders of bonds issued in California will
be- paid by San Francisco. This will
amount to *156,M3, of which $86,000 will go
annually for the park bonds and $99,000
annually for the Improvement bonds.
There are some places in the State
where bonds have not been taxed, accord-
Ing to the returns of the officers. One of
theee places is Ventura, where neither
State, county nor municipal bonds have
been assessed in eighteen years. Mayor
Burke of Santa Barbara writes that nei
ther State, county nor municipal bonds
are assessed in the city or county of San
ta Barbara. A Santa Barbara bank holds
111,000 of sewer bonds which are never as
sessed for taxes. Auditor Schauer of San
ta Barbara County takes the same view,
that neither the bonds of county, school
nor municipalities are taxable In this
State.
The total of State, county and municipal
bonds that will soon pay interest abroad
is rather over than under J15.000.000. Aa
has been shown, there Is no way to reach
the exact amount for the reason that the
authorities cay theydo not know where
the bonds are held. But, allowing that the
average interest payment on this sum is
2H per cent per annum, it appears that
the amount of $525,000 will be diverted an
nually to outsiders in interest money, and
the outsiders are able to evade the taxes
by taking the bonds away. At the same
time the California taxpayers are com
pelled to pay a higher rate of tax to meet
the higher rate of interest on the bonds
made necessary by the tax Imposed upon
the bonds.

NEW YORK. Jan. S.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will cay:
Easier conditions In the money market, to
gether with the effective support from leading
Interests in the industrial and railroad share
lists, Dartlcularly the Vanderbllt trunk lines,
gave a good tone to the market at the begin
ning of the year. The transactions of last
Saturday were of the usual limited kind in ad
vance of two days' holiday, but prices were
firm, and the feeling of the market Indicated a
belief that the financial situation had Improved.
This Impression was not negatived by the
weekly bank statement, although the changes
In the averaces for the week were not of very
signal character. On Tuesday, when the Ex
change reopened, professional buying was In
evidence, while, money, apart from come tern
temporary Irregularity, ruled at about 6 per
cent; and the foreign markets were generally
calm, with some slight indications of bullish
ness. Quotations thereupon advanced through
out the list, attention being given to special
securities, of which the Pacific railroads, the
Vanderbllt trunk line stocks and the steel and
tobacco Industrials were the most prominent. A
declining tendency in Brooklyn Rapid Transit
bad no effect on the rest of the list, and that
stocTc re<Â»vered later, mainly upon the cover-
Ing by the short Interest In it. It was notice
able, however, that the market. In spite of Us
relatively fair degree of activity, was extremely
professional, and that the public's part in the
movement, as indicated by the transactions
carried out by the commission houses, was, on
the whole, small. London purchased a few
stocks, but Its chief influence on the market
came from the easing oft of discount rates In
the open market, and the more cheerful specu
lative sentiment which developed with the news
that some. success had attended the maneuvers
of the British forces In South Africa. On
Wednesday afternoon, however, there was a
change In the attitude of our snarket, which
had its origin abroad. It would seem that the
money market conditions at Berlin have not
improved, and that the seizure of a German
vessel carrying supplies to the Transvaal was
regarded as likely to put a strain upon the al
ready difficult relations between Germany and
Great Britain. At all events, heavy sales of
German holdings of American stocks were
noted In both London and New York, and the
market lost a considerable part of Its previous
Improvements. Vague report* of British re
verses In the South African war added to the
uncertainty, while the fact that in spite of
easier rates for money In London exchange ad
vanced more or less also had its effect On
Thursday the market presented further Indica
tions of an incipient break, owing to further
decline* In price* for. Americans in London, but
before the day ended a decided rally set In
under the lead of the trunk lines stocks. This
was due largely to reports that some Important
arrangements had been effected which are cal
culated to improve the already harmonious re
lations of the leading trunk line properties.
It Is also thought- that, the announcement of
the transfer of the electric light organization
created by the leading interests in Metropolitan
Traction, to the Consolidated Gas, will teed to
bring about an early settlement of the New
York gaa war.
Bank Clearings.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â Bradstreet's review of
bank clearings for 1599 shows that the totalof
the United States was $93,504,332,656, an Increase
of $25.004,&96,426 over the total of 1898. New York
ranks first among the cities, with a total for
the year of $60,761,791,900; Boston is second, with
$7,086,293,271, and Chicago Is third, with $6 si?
313.611. The clearings for 1599 were more than"
double those for 1594. Boston in 1599 moved
ahead of Chicago, the latter city dropping to
third place. Philadelphia. St. Louis. PittsbW

Â«r?=ed a considerable range to-day, moving
forward in the early dealings and- then pur
ruing a retrograde course to about last night's
level. The deduction to be drawn is that
professional trader* are disinclined to under
take extensive speculative commitments. The
most effective influence toward this disposition
is the conviction that the mor.ey markets of
the world are not yet in condition to afford
abundant fund* for Fpeculation on credit. The
Incident which pointed this moral was the un
expected proportions of the gold engagements
for to-morrow's eteamer, mounting up to $3.
6fo.w*3. as compared with preliminary estimates
of R.0W.000. Large engagements were made in
tplte of F.-ip-jring interest rates in lyondon and
a rharp decline in the discount rate at Ber
lin. It if evident, therefore, that the British
Government designs abundant uÂ»e for large
additional funds and that available gold sup
plies will be drawn to London as far as r>oÂ«
eihle. Fuch a prospect makes definitely arainst
the probability of an easy money market
In New York !n rpite of the replenishment
which various factors are now bringing to this
cer.t*r. The cause of the morning's strength
In the Â»tock market was the cessation of the

eorption of NVw York <"VntrÃl stocks in the

Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Failures In 1899 were 9393 In number, with
liabilities of $123,132,689. The last 'days of the
year added a few to the number and some
millions to the known liabilities of firms and
banks which failed close to the end. so that
commercial defaults reached $50,979,889, of
which $30,792,164 were in manufacturing, $48.
924,771 In trading and $11,162,934 in brokerage,
promoting and other commercial liabilities.
Most people in business have been s3s 3 occu
pied with their accounts and the settlements
of the past year that little new business has
yet been done. No new tendency In manu
facture or In trading appears and lesÃ change
than was anticipated In money markets.
There Is nothing unsound In the business of
the great Industries, but an extensive revision
of prices may disappoint extreme expectations.
Two ways of stimulating business are adopted.
The Iron Age notices "transactions of magni
tude in foundry iron, which indicate that some
sellers are willing to make concessions to
secure the trade of good customers."
Hut the steel and wire company has ad
vanced prices of wire nails, barbed and smooth
wire 25 cents. Bessemer pig Is not higher than
it was six months ago and steel plates have
declined from $3 10 to $2 25 at Philadelphia,
bars at Plttsburg from $2 23 to $2 13 and sheets
from ?3 15 to $2 80, while the structural and
rail producers have refused to advance
prices. Some new business is reported,
but not enough as yet to indicate the tendency.
In tin. after a fall from 33c to 25c, the price
rises to J25 23, with Ix>ndon, and In copper
Jl6 50.1s quoted Instead of $18 50 a month ago.
The' disposition to ask higher prices is seen
In boot 3 and shoes, 20c advance being asked on
some tor which 17%e was asked and paid In
November. The yielding In hides at Chicago,
In spite of short receipts because warm weather
has checked killing by farmers, has reached
6 per cent In the past month. Cotton goods
are at the highest Â¦ quotations of last year,
with good demand, though cotton has declined
a little. But the goods were at no time ad
vanced quite In proportion to the material and
are in that sense cheaper now than a year
ago. Woolen goods are also much lower with
respect to wool than a year ago and some
further advance has been expected. Wool Is
strongly held, though pricea of a month ago
cannot be obtained. Cotton does not rise
further because receipts from plantations have
somewhat increased and accounts of large
stocks at many small towns have attracted
attention. At Southern mills which can easily
supply themselves with large stocks from the
surrounding country without passing the cot
ton through any market or drawing it ifhtll
it Is wanted many have done so far their pro
tection against the publicly announced com
bination last fall to raise prices. These mills
consumed laat year 1.400,000 bales, but are
reckoned as having taken for this year's crop
only 491.000 bales.
Wheat still moved very sluggishly, with small
change in prices. In six months of the crop
year about 99,000.000 bushels, flour Included,
have been exported, against 123,000,1)00 last year.
Atlantic exports have now fallen to only 2.050,
926 bushels for the week, against 6.214,420 last
year, and Pacific exports were 531,225, against
614.833 last year. The price is practically un
changed, as also for corn, of which 3,923.195
bushels have been exported for the week,
against 3,572,412 last year.
Failures for the week have been 273 In the
United States, against 243 laat year, and 25
In Canada, against 24 last year.

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 6,^1900.
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
CHICAGO, Jan. s.â The wheat market opened
easy on the absence of any stimulating news,
May a shade under yesterday at 69Vi@69%c
This was the high notch for the day, for there
after the price went under puts and stayed
there, buying against those privileges causing
only, the feeblest upward motions. The poor
export business was one reason for selling; good
crop news from Argentine and elsewhere an
other. The weakness of Northwest markets-
Minneapolis showing a greater failing off than
Chicagoâ and selling orders from that section
were also a factor In the weakness. On the
decline considerable long wheat was let out.
With this array of gloomy news the fact that
receipts were more liberal and clearances small
added but little to the discouragement of the
bulls. Ten thousand bushels of cash wheat
was sold for the seaboard, but In view of the
large stocks the transaction was contemptu
ously labeled "retail business" and forgotten.
May slumped as far as possible, then closed
weak, %c under yesterday, at 6S%c
The strength exhibited early by the provision
market was overcome later by heavy realizing,
prosecuted throughout the session with great
animation. May pork closed 10Â®_%c under
yesterday. May lard 7%Â®10c under and May
ribs 6g>7%c down.
Corn, steadied by provisions for a time, later
succumbed to the Influence of wheat and thÂ«
reaction of provisions and closed rather easy.
May >4o down.
The trade in oais was srsall and price* a
shade lower In sympathy with the other grain
markets. May. closed easy %c under yester
day.

NEW YORK. Jan. S.-Bradstreef* will cay
to-morrow: The business world' has 'â¢marked
time", this week pending the results of annual
stock-takings and the passing away of the
holiday Influences which usually make for
quietness at thla period. Aside from the
strengthening of values of a number of staples,
such; as the- cereals, provisions and cotton,
which are Â¦peculatlvely dealt In, there has been
no decided movement forward, but on the other
hand the strength of all other stable values
points to there having been no backward step
taken. Perhaps the most notable movement
among leading staples is that developed In
nogs and hog products, a better realization be
ing had of the features making for strength
in those products, notable among which being
the reduction In the supply of hogs, which. Ilka
the similar falling off in number of cattle. haÂ«
gone on for a number of years past. That the
advance in hog products is beginning to at
tract more attention seems evident from the
extent to^ which the advance has had sympa
thetic reflection In the prices of wheat and
other cereals, which really trace some of the
strength which has been shown this week to
that quarter.
While stocks of wheat have fallen off In
Europe and shipments there to December were
the lightest recorded for many years, still
stocks have Increased In this country to nearly
as great an extent.
_Owlng to the continued light movement and
the confidence with which holders maintain
prices cotton has advanced slightly during the
week. It la evident that the new plan of
warehousing cotton Is having a measureable
Influence upon the movement In sight.
in iron and steel quiet strength has. as for
many, weeks past, been the notable feature.
A rather more aggressive feeling is noted at
Chicago, where wire and nails have been con
siderably, advanced and bar steel, angles and
channels have also moved upward. With the
country's production sold ahead as heavily as
It Is there Is naturally little or no immediate
new offering. No sign of weakness
In the steel market Is perceptible and there
has been in fact a marking up of the nominal
rates. The hardware trade has completed a
year < remarkable in many respects,, and . the
report comes from the West that a number
of salesmen did not leave the road at all dur
ing- the holidays, but kept steadily at work.
Light hardware of some sorts has been marked
up this week. . .
Lumber. ls seasonably quiet, but all prepara
tions for an. active spring business are per
ceptible. A point of much interest to the lum
ber trade is the- possible placing of an im
mediate order for a billion feet of pine for the
Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. Prices
show no weakness.
Textiles display notable strength. Next sea
son cotton goods will all open higher and in
finished products particularly there Is a chance
for expansion, as. quotations in those lines have
not. moved up to a- parity, with gray goods.
The short supply of water is beginning to
affect the output of New England cotton mills,
and this promises to introduce still another
element of strength â¢ into holders' positions.
Wool, though quiet, Is strong and manu
factured goods will certainly open at good ad
vances.. The bulk of the old crop is claimed
to have already been marketed. Export trade
for our fine wool is good, as evidenced by some
shipments this week to England. Some buy
ers are said to have bought wool that Is yet
on the sheep's back In the West. â¢

concern is for ray work among your peo
lile.' I told him' not to worry, that 'his
sons and his friends were caring for thnt
work, for I did not want him to worry,
thinking that to ease his mind would re
store his health. We all feel his loss, and
we feel as if we had lost our right hands "
Mong Chung, another convert, uald:
"We have lost our great friend in Dr.
Masters. He brought me to the true re
ligion, and I will carry on his work as far
as I can for him."
The interment was at Mountain View
Cemetery.
DELANOY AND
EMONS MEET
FACE TO FACE
The Clash Was One
of Words Only.
ALAMEDA, Jap. 5â Fred N. Delanoy,
famous victim of a letter-writer negligent
as to his signature, and George W. Em
mons, accused by inference of being re
sponsible for the missives, met by chance
on a San Francisco-bound train this mom
ing.
Emmons accosted Delanoy. A crash of
words followed, but fists, arms and kicks
were held in abeyance. A crowd gathered
about the two men. expectant of an en
counter, but there was a disappointment.
There was a demand from Emmons why
Delanoy should even Intimate that he was
the author of the letters. Delanoy said he
did not care to talk unless in the pres
ence of his attorney. Emmons got mad.
Delanoy got "cold feet." He shifted to
another car, and Emmons shifted after
him, determined to get some satisfaction.
Finally Emmons ascertained that Senator
E. K. Taylor was Delanoy's attorney. He
demanded that they should return to Ala
meda. talk the difficulty over with the at
torney and try to reach an understand
ing. This plan Delanoy agreed to. They
went to Senator Taylor's office, remain
ing closeted for two hours.
The parties to the conference refuse to
parade any of the details. It is under
stood that there were accusations from
Delanoy. but that they were bowled over
by the direct refutations of Emmons.
The story of the cause of the enmity ex
isting between Emmons and Delanoy, as
told in yesterday's Call, is substantially
correct. They were partners in business
in San Francisco ten years ago. They
had a difficulty and separated. Shortly
afterward Delanoy's first wife received an
unsigned letter reflecting on her husband.
Delanoy imagined it then to be the spite
work of Emmons. This is the probable
explanation why Delanoy lays the blame
for the recent letters at Emmons' door.
In the conference before Senator Tayior
he reiterated this belief, but said that if
he was wrong there was no reparation he
would not be willing to make for his mis
take.' He would even get down on his
knees to riKht the wrong.
No one seriously believes that George
W. Emmons has any knowledge of the let
ters. He Is a genial and impulsive man.
but not one who would stoop to sending
anonymous letters. He Is as anxious as
anyl>ody to clear up the mystery. He
thinks there is evidence of a conspiracy
to fasten the offense on him.
Delanoy failed to receive any letters to
day.

ROME ANTEDATES ROMULUS.
The Eternal City Existed Before Its
Beputed Founder.
It Is all very well to demolish William
Tell, Shakespeare and Beatrice Cencl, but
when it comes to denying the existence of
Romulus and Remus it is another ques
tion altogetherâ for the Romans, says the
Pall Mall Gazette.
Although opinions have always dif
fered about the exact date of the founda
tion of Rome, the calculations of the his
torian Varrone have been considered the
most reliable, : who put it at the eighth
century B. C. The people, however, who
desire a definite date have ever declared
that the Eternal City was founded by
Romulus 753 years B. C, and that the au
dacious shepherd laid the first stone on
the Palatine, on April 12 exactly, bo that
the city is now 2602 years old. Now, to
the general indignation, the archaeologist
O. Montelius comes forward with docu
ments to prove that the ancient mistress
of the world arose much earlier than eight
centuries 8.C., there being remains- of
the ninth, tenth,. eleventh and twelfth cen
turies before the Christian era. The con
clusion to be. drawn is that Rome has at
least the respectable age of 3100 years,
that Romulus and his brother have never
existed and that the wolf, kept in the cage
on. the top of the Capltollne Hill, as con
firmation of'the legend, Is nothing but an I
impostor,' - j

CURSE ON A
HORSE CAUSES
MUCH TROUBLE
Hurdle Jumper Tor
toni Haunted.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan.' 5. "
The old hurdle-racer Tortoni has again
got several people into trouble, and
many of the. people conversant with the
history of the animal declare that" It is
suffering from the maledictions of a dis
gruntled jockey. .Not only' that, but sev
eral of them declare that the curse which
attached to the equine sprinter Is bo far
reaching in its effects as to embrace every
person who has anything to do with the
brute. â¢
The animal was first tracked by Dan
Miller. Although It was one- of the most
promising racers on the coast; bad luck
attended all of Its entries and the horse
invariably lost to inferior bang-tails, and
generally with no apparent- reason. Mil
ler lost $150,000 and went broke before giv
ing up Tortonl; and every man who has
handled him since has been a pecuniary
loser by the transaction.
J. H. Burrls got , hold of the animal
about two years ago on an execution. He
gave the'horse" to" Mike Kenny to Â¦ train
and race, but the venture was a losing
one and Burris soon owed the trainer $300
for feed. To liquidate the claim he gave
Tortonl to Kenny and took a chattel
mortgage back for $200.
Kenny then transferred the horse to Al
Smith. The latter won several races at
Ingleside with the animal and then Kenny
sought to have the transfer set aside. The
matter became complicated and Kenny
claimed fraud. Burrls stepped in in the
meantime and . seized the r horse on his
chattel mortgage., The Grand Jury is now
attempting to straighten out the matter.

CONTEST OVER
THE BACON WILL
BEING HEARD
Alleged Big Mistake
of "Two" for "Ten."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 5.
The contest over the already probated
will of the late Henry Bacon, brought by
Professor Frank Soule and Mrs. Mamie
C. Bacon against F. Page Bacon and the
oCher trustees of the estate, was begun
In real earnest to-day, when the demurrer
of defendants to the bill in equity came
up for argument.
The matter was heard In Judge Ells
worth's department, he and Judges Hall
and Ogden sitting in bank, and tnere was
an array of legal talent and legal lore
seldom witnessed outside of a bupreme
Court room. The long tables were Btacked
with books for citation, around which sat
Attorneys Guy C. Earl, Bishop & Wheeler
and W. W. Deainer, representing "plain
tiffs, and Attorneys R. B. Mitchell, Camp
bell & Fowler, for the trustees.
The contests or suits are over a very
material discovery made by Attorney F.
A. Berlin long after the will had been pro
bated and the estate distributed. It ap
pears that the contestants had received
a copy of the will in which they were be
queathed but "two" thousand dollars, and
this amount they each accepted and gave
receipts for the same. Attorney Berlin
one day. on consulting the original will,
discovered that the latter instrument reaa
"ten" thousand instead of "two" thu
sand in regard to the contestants' lega
cies. A demand for the balance, $16,000,
had been made on the executors, but they
refused.
The demurrer was to the complaint and
supplemental complaint, and during the
argument Attorney Earl stated that it
appeared F. Page Bacon had misled his
wife, now divorced, ns to the amount of
the legacy and that he had congratulated
her upon receiving $2000.
Attorney Mitchetl argued that the court
of equity had no Jurisdiction to set the
decree of distribution aside, and the mat
ter was continued until February 12, to
be submitted on briefs.

are a preat many young ladies who come
here from other localities and are fear
ful lest they pet into places that are not
respectable. I am well acquainted every
where end think that I can find homes
for this class of young women which will
prove satisfactory to them. Of course I
ehall deal in real estate generally, but
this cla^s- of work will be the general
feature of my business and everything
else will be subordinate to It."
Death of a Female Pioneer.
LIVERMORE. Jan. s.â Mrs. M. O'Brien,
widow of the late Captain O'Brien, died
yesterday after a protracted illness. Tho
deceased came to California with her hus
band, in the early sixties. He was at one
time one of the largest sheep owners in
the State, possessing ranches comprising
thousands of acres. In addition to that
he was largely engaged in the coal min
ing inaustry. The funeral has not yet
been arranged.
OAKLAND, Jan. s.â Five hundred
Chinamen occupied the center of
the First Methodist Church this
afternoon. Some wore the garb of
their native land, some were dressed in
the latest American fashion, while some
wore a hybrid costume that savored of
both America and China, but all came to
pay their respects to the memory of Rev.
F. J. Masters, for more than fifteen years
superintendent of the Methodist Chinese
mission In San Francisco. They were a
portion of the converts that had been
made by Dr. Masters during his work in
San Francisco, and there were no more
sorrowful mourners in the great church
than these Chinese.
The Chinese, among whom Dr. Masters
had worked all his life, made special re
quest that they be permitted to take an
active part in the funeral, and this re
quest was granted, even to the giving of
two Chinese addresses, which were trans
lated into English by Dr. Gardner, the ,
Chinese interpreter of the Custom-house
in San Francisco. Each Chinese who par
ticipated actively in the services wore a
small knot of white ribbon in his coat,
this being the Oriental mourning color,
and these little strips of white ribbon
were a strong contrast to the somber
black of the white mourners in the
church.
All of the prominent Methodist divines
and workers in this section of the State
attended the funeral to show th^'r respect
for the departed one. the following being
present:
Rev. A. T. Needham, East Oakland;

HUNTER NEARLY DROWNED
BY OVERTURNING OF A SKIFF.
ALAMEDA Jan. s.â The capsizing of a
skiff nearly cost Hervey Darneal Jr. of
903 Grand street his life Wednesday night.
Young Darneal was hunting on the bay
until after dark, and while attempting to
shoot some ducks that were flying over
him capsized his boat, lie wore heavy
clothing, which weighted him so mucn
that he was unable to swim ashore â a
good half-mile distant. He had to con
tent himself with calling lustily for
assistance and hoping that it would coma
to him before he became too exhausted
to reta'n his hold on tne keel of the up
turned iklff.
Darneai was in the water for over an
hour and he felt himself growing be
numbed and weaker. Finally his snouts
were heard by John Havens, keeper of the
Encinal Yacht Club, and Thomas O'Con
nor, who nves near the bay shore. They
hastily put off in Â« boat and just reached
Darneal in time to save him.
DR. MASTER'S CONVERTS
MOURNED HIS DEATH
TO IMPROVE THE
LAKE FRONTAGE
ALONG JACKSON
Residents Plan Public
Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 5.
The property owners of Jackson street
have decided to erect a handsome balus
trade at the foot of that thoroughfare to
prevent horses and people from acciden
tally walking into the lake at that point.
Several weeks ago the city made arrange
ments to place a fence there at a cost of
$25. but when the residents of this neigh
borhood learned of this they declared that
the thing must be a more ornate affair.
A. Schilling, who owns the land con
tiguous to the lake, has agreed to stand
half the cost of the matter, and the bal
ance will be subscribed by other property
owners in the vicinity. ThÂ« balustrade
will cost in the- neighborhood of JlOOO.
THE MATRON
AND YOUTH HAVE
DISAPPEARED
Two Vacancies in Two
Oakland Homes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Jan. 5.
The people of East Oakland are all agog
over the supposed elopement of a seven
teen-year-old youth of that locality with
a matron who has passed thirty-five sum
mers and winters before getting into the
twentieth century. The lady who is said
to possess migratory affections is Mrs.
J. Davis, the wife of a railroad man re
siding at 1181 East Twenty-second street.
The youngster who is accused of being
her paramour Is William Crowhurst Jr.,
an awkward, freckle-faced, tow-haired
boy who but recently emerged from
school and has not yet fully embarked
upon a career of self-support. Gossiping
neighbors say that the infatuation was
mutual. As a result the couple are now
gone from Oakland and are supposed to
be enjoying the honeymoon of a whilom
love somewhere in the north.
Crowhurst. pere, who is an evangelist
and temperance lecturer, with no perma
nent lecturing place, has repudiated his
son and has called down the wrath from
above upon the head of his child and the
female who is said to have alienated the
affections of the susceptible youth. The
husband of the woman, however. takes
the matter complacently and declares that
the scandal has been caused by the un
necessary frothings of the erstwhile de
nouncer of the demon rum.
"It is true that my wife left Oakland,"
said Mr. Davis, "but I know where she
is and am confident that she will soon re
turn. Several weeks ago I received an
anonymous letter in which her relations
with young Crowhurst were denounced.
Although I did not believe the accusa
tions she got hold of the epistle and be
came sick in consequence. Then she went
away. Young Crowhurst also left town,
but I do not know whether they went to
gether."
Davis said that he had not placed the
letter In the hands of the postal authori
ties and that he had no Intention of doing
so. He Intimated that he knew who the
author was, but* would pay no attention to
it, although he admitted that it had vili
fied his wife in a most scathing manner.
His twelve-year-old -daughter cried bit
terly when asked the whereabouts of her
mother, and declared that she did not
know.
The father of young Crowhurst was out
of the city. His mother was seen, how
ever, and when asked where her boy was
she contemptuously declared that 11 would
be necessary to locate Mrs. Davis In order
to find him.
IT ENJOYED A
"GOOD THING"
IN THE ENCINAL
Â» Â«.
Sunset Company May
Forfeit Franchise.
ALAMEDA. Jan. s.â Thus reads section
four of the franchise granted the Sunset
Telephone and Telegraph Company by the
city of Alameda. March 12. ISSS. In the
face of this positive agreement to furni3h
the municipality with free telephone ser
vice the Sunset Company seeks to mulct
the city of 5579 25. at the same time charg
ing the people of Alameda extortionate
rates for service and disfiguring the
â¢treets with hideous skyscraplng poles
and multitudinous wires.
The Sunset Company has presented to
the Board of Trustees a bill for JCT9 23 for
twelve months' telephonic service ren
dered the city officials. The company has
entirely ignored the free telephone pro
viso embodied in the franchise. For eleven
years the Sunset monopoly presented
monthly its little bills, and they were paid
promptly. The city unburdened itself of
*om*> $2300 during the eleven years, which
Jt rcipht just as well have retained had
the existence of the free service section
be^n known to the officials.
The city officials seem to have been in
Utter Ignorance that there was such a
section. Bills might have been honored
until doomsday had not The Call made the
discovery that there was one. The atten
tion of the Board of Trustees was directed
to it by a story published in The Call on
January 4. IS?9. The City Attorney was
requested to examine the franchise and
to pass upon the legal status of the bills
presented with such regularity for pay
ment. In his written opinion to the Trus
tees he stated that- the telephone company
could not collect for rental of telephones
placed in public offices or the transmission
of messages relative to public business.
The disclosure that money was illegally
paid out did not fease the Sunset people
in the least. They cheerfully continued to
present bill? to the city until to date the
accrued amount is $679 25. They have
waited patiently enough now for payment,
and are ready to go to any length to man
ufacture trouble for the city. Th*> City
Trustees anticipate a legal battle with the
telephone monopolists, and will fight to
the end.
The first move In the controversy was
made several days apo, when Manacvr
Fleming of the Oakland office of the Sun
pet Company notified City Clerk Lamborn
that he had betn instructed to take all
telephones out of the City Hall. If the
company persists In its intention it Trill
be met Â¦with an injunction suit, and the.
City Trustees may declare a franchise for
feited and order wires and poles ren.a.ed.

HORSEFLESH IN SAUSAGES.
The case of Charles Haag, sausage man
ufacturer. Valencia street, convicted â¢by
Judge Conlan of using horseflesh in the
manufacture of his sausages, was finally
disposed of yesterday by the Judge im
posing a fine of $50 with the usual alter
native. Â¦
Attorney Dlnkelsplel, on behalf of Haag,
made a motion for arrest of Judgment and
a new trial,' which was refused, and he
astonished the court by maintaining that
every butcher In the city was ten times
worse than Haag, as in their bologna
sausages they put pork and led puchasers
to believe it was all beef. The only effect
lt had upon the Judge was to first excite
wonder and then laughter. Dlnkelsplel

TEACHINGS OF HIPPOCRATES.
Dr. Lane Opens His Course of Lect
ures in Cooper Medical College.
The eighteenth annual course of LanÂ©
lectures was begun last night in Cooper
Medical by Dr. C. L. Lane, his
subject being. "Hippocrates and Some
Things Which He Has Taught." Dr. Lane
characterized Hippocrates as the most
learned doctor of ancient times and one
of the most remarkable figures In history,
and the titles of "Father of Medicine"
and "Divine Old Man" had been most
aptly applied to him. After tracing tho
career and relating some of the wonderful
cures of Hippocrates, Dr. Lane said:
"No doubt the science of medicine
greatly advanced during the tlmo of Hip
pocrates, who assigned a high place to a
careful selection of food In the treatment
of diseases. He kept a record of the
symptoms of various diseases and pre
scribed what his experience had shown to
be good. He framed his observations into
a system of medicine, and although he
could never separate himself from the
ancient belief that the four elements were
fire, water, earth and air, his researches
have formed the groundwork upon which
the wonderful progress of medicine has
been founded."

NO STREET RAILWAY COMBINE.
Prominent Men In Three Roads Put a
Quietus Upon a Somewhat
Sensational Story.
A story was published in an evening
paper that Robert P. Morrow was making
a deal with the California and Union
street roads to go into a combine with
the Market-street Railway, with the Sut
ter-street and Sutro lines. The names of
J. B. Stetson, Charles- Holbrook and R. P.
Morrow were mentioned to give an ap
pearance of reality to the story. Those
gentlemen were seen by a reporter for The
Call last evening.
"I never heard of any deal until I saw
the story in the evening paper," said R. F.
Morrow. "If there is such a deal going on
and I am taking part in it that is very
queer, for I do not know anything
about it."
"The first that I have heard about it
was when a reporter called on me this
evening and asked me If the California
street road had been aproached by Mr.
Morrow with a view to making the ru
mored deal," said Mr. Stetson. I am the
president of the California-street road and
If there was any deal pending I would be
pretty apt to hear about it. You are au
thorized to say for me that I do not know
and never have heard, except in the way
that I have already mentioned, that there
was any talk of a deal of the eort men
tioned."
f "My opinion is that It is a canard," said
Charles Holbrook, who is a director of, the
Market-street Railway. "I have never
heard that Mr. Morrow was trying to
make a deal for the consolidation of the
lines mentioned. There is nothing to it
My reason for thinking so is that the In
terests are too antagonistic. '*

QUARREL AT CARDS
DOES DUTY FOR HOLD-UP
Charles Wenneberg Was Only Bat
tered Bya Friend and Not by-
Mission Footpads.
Charles Wenneberg, who resides at 637
Elizabeth street, was not held up Wednes
day night by footpads, robbed of $400 and
beaten into insensibility at Twenty-second
and Castro streets. He merely got the
worst of a quarrel at his own residence
over a presumably friendly game of cards.
Gus Edberg was his assailant.
Edberg called at Wenneberg's home and
was soon engaged in a card game, which
progressed till host and guest quarreled
over the stakes. The dispute was settled
by Edberg hitting Wenneberg on the
head with a cuspidor. At this stage of the
proceedings Officers E. J. Thomson and
George Farrell took a hand in the gamÂ©.
Edberg was. locked up on the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon and Wenne
berg was taken to the County Hospital to
have his head stitched.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, 1900.
THREE CHINESE LAND
WITHOUT LEGAL AID
Escaped From the Detention Shed.
Their Applications for Admis
sion Had Been Denied. ,
Some time during last Thursday night
threo of 'the ninety-six Chinese Immi
grants In the detention shed at the Mall
dock escaped, and there was much per
turbation In consequence at the Chinese
bureau and the steamship company's of
fice yesterday.
Chinese in the detention shed are by a
legal fiction supposed to be on board the
steamer on which they arrived, awaiting
the decision of thÂ© Collector of the Port,
the Secretary of the Treasury and the
Federal courts as to their right to land,
and they are fed at the expense of the
steamship company, which is held by the
Chinese bureau responsible for their safe
keeping.
The Collector of Customs has provided
three watchmen, each of whom does an
eight-hour turn, his station being at the
osily door of exit and entrance. All of the
Chinese in the shed had beeen denied a
landing and were awaiting deportation,
habeas corpus writs, etc. The three who
escaped broke a back window overlooking
the shed roof of the Mail dock, broke the
wire netting which the steamship com
pany had attached to It, got on tne roof
and slid to the ground on a lead pipe,
thereby getting a lead pipe cinch on lib
erty.
A special corps of customs inspectors
was at once dispatched on the chase.

"CRAP" GAMESTERS ENTERTAINING JUDGE SMITH.
f iÂ» \ HERE were eight persons arrested late at night for engng-
Ji ing in an alleged unlawful gambling game, and upon re
quest of one of the attorneys of the persons so charged I
left my residence in order to accept bail and bonds for their re
lease. Thin I considered my duty, and it is not exceptional, but
has often been done by me before. After the ofllcial duty of releas
ing the defendants had been accomplished, I was invited by Attor
ney Harry Pulcifer, a personal friend of mine, to partake of some
slicht refreshment at the restaurant on Eleventh street.
While there nome of the persons charged with Rambling- came
in, without my knowledge or connivance, and, it being a public
place, had as much rtelit there an I had.
There nan no conversation held of the least impropriety.

TWO COMMERCIAL
BODIES WORKING
ON WATER FRONT
Asking Harbor Board
Questions.
LOOKING INTO THE EXPENSE
DISCUSSING ALSO ADEQUACY OF
WHARVES.
Two commercial organizations of the
city are taking a lively interest In the ad
ministration of the water front, these be
ing the Chamber of Commerce and the
Merchants' Association. The Chamber
of Commerce has been Investigating the
cost of the administration for some time.
An annual meeting of the chamber will bo
held upon the lGth inst. At that time a
report and possibly two reports will be
made, a majority and a minority report.
While these reports are guarded with
care it is known to be the fact that rec
ommendations will be made looking to the
reduction of the Harbor Board's expenses
by the dismissal of some of those now
employed. R. G. Sneath, one of the com
mittee, will recommend the dismissal of
all or nearly all of the collectors, of whom
there are .fifteen. This rumor wad about
the water front yesterday and it was ac
knowledged to be a fact last night by
Mr. Sneath.
"I went down and had a long talk with
the Commissioners Thursday afternoon,"
said Mr. Sneath, "and inquired particu
larly about the number of collectors era
ployed. I was told that the collectors do
not all collect, but that they do other duty
and were rated as collectors oenau&o they
could be hired cheaper as collectors. Ido
not think that more than one man is
needed as a collector, for a large share
of the money that comes In la on the
credit list and is collected only once a
month. What the committee w'll report
I cannot say."
A committee from the Merchants' As
sociation passed some time yesterday aft
ernoon in consultation with the Harbor
Board concerning the necessity for more
wharf accommodation and also concern
ing the expectations of the board about
the immediate increase of wharves in the
near future. The committee consisted of
Directors Sims, Sherwood and E. B. Pond.
Mr. Sims opened the proceedings by ex
plaining the purpose of the committee. He
said that the Merchants' Association had
no captious criticism to offer. The com
mittee did not come before the board with
a chip on Its shoulder. He hoped that
the board would understand that all th^t
was sought was Information concerning
the facilities existing or needed for the
use of the shipping of the port. There
were 1100 members of the Merchants' As
sociation. They were of the opinion that
everything should bo done that could be
done for the commercial welfare of San
Francisco. The city had relied alone upon
Providence too long. Now that the expan
sion of trade Is predicted, and generally
expected, it was time to be on the move.
Director Sherwood said that he had
heard that there had been times lately
when there was not sufficient' wharf ac
commodation. How was that?
A general discussion followed that last
ed an hour. The Commissioners furnished
information from records.
Major Harney made a showing of the
finances of the board, and also told about
the new wharves which the board expect
ed to have under way during the coming
year. The most material facts shown
were that the board expected to have
money enough, and a balance of about
$3000 over, If the Income was according ro
the outlook for the year, to build
Howard-street wharf No. 3, to build a new
postofnee for Station D at the ferry, to
construct two wharves between Union
and Lombard streets, to rebuild the fish
ermen's wharf at the foot of Taylor street,
to complete the Santa Fe freight slip and
to widen, lengthen and cover the Main
street wharf, all out of the revenues of
the board. Engineer Holmes explained to
the committee the work planned to be
done during the year, using a water front
map for the purpose.
There was some talk concerning the ex
tension of the pier line. The most of the
facts developed have been previously pub
lished In The Call. The committee will
report to the association.
VICTORIA TOWED
BY THE BRUTUS
REACHES GUAM
Overdue Transport Is
Now in Safety.
OPPOSITION LINE TO SOUND
Â»
RELEASED TRANSPORTS TO BE
PUT ON THE ROUTE.
Tho overdue transport Victoria, on
which 20 per cent reinsurance was paid
by the underwriters, is safe. A dispatch
to the Merchants' Exchange from Manila
states that on December 25 she started
from Guam for the Philippines in tow of
the naval transport Brutus. The latter
vessel towed the coast defense steamer
Monterey from San Francisco to Manila,
so there is no doubt but what she will
get the Victoria to her destination in
safety.
Tho Victoria left here on October 12
with a general cargo of supplies for the
soldiers in the Philippines. On November
9 she was spoken by the transport Tartar
with the thrust block of her main shaft
broken. Assistance was offered the dis
abled vessel, but the captain refused a
tow on the ground that he could reach a
port of safety without a tow.
The steamers Brutus and Yosemito
have, for the last few months, been sur
veying a cable route between Guam and
the Philippines. The supposition is that
tho Brutus, while engaged in this work,
picked up the Victoria and towed her into
Guam. After fitting out she then took the
disabled transport in tow again and start
ed for Manila. The transport Wyefield ar
rived at Manila yesterday and as she was
to call at Honolulu and Guam after leav
ing here, the chances are that she took
the news of thu Victoria's safety along
with her.
The chances are that in another two
months there will be a competing line of
steamers between San Francisco and
Puget Sound ports. The owners of the
transports Glenogle, Victoria, Tacoma
and Columbia aro said to have secured an
American registry for their British bot
toms by a special act of Congress and are
going to run the veseels on the coast.
When the Dowdells of Seattle chartered
tho vessels to the Government they
thought the war would be long continued
and that the Glenogle, Victoria, Tacoma
and Columbia would continue carrying
troops and supplies for many moons to
come. On the strength ot this they char
tered other vessels to fill the places of
their own ships in the Oriental trade by
the year. Now comes the news from
Washington that all chartered vessels are
to be returned to their owners as soon
as they again reach San Francisco. This
will leave Dowdell & Co. with four or five
surplus vessels on their hands.
The concern has not been idle in the In
terim, however, and on the strength of
their vessels' services as transports it is
said they have induced Uncle Sam to
grant them an American registry. As the
Dowden s chartered steamers have to be
kept going there Is nothing left for the
Glenogle, Victoria, Tacoma and Columbia
to do but enter into the coast trade in op
position- to tho Pacific Coast Steamship
Company. This will mean a rate war that
will end In tho absorption of one Une by
the other.
The four barges which have of late
been carrying rock from the Columbia
River to Grays Harbor for the improve
ment of the latter plnce are now to carry
lumber from Grays Harbor to San Fran
cisco. The appropriation for the Improve
ment of Grays Harbor has given out. and
In consequence there is nothing for the
barges to do. They are fine large ves
sels and will be fitted with a schooner
rig, so thaf In the event of their break
ing away from the tug they could take
care of themselves. They are named
Washongal, Washtucua, Wahkiakum and
Wallacut and will carry- nearly a million
feet of lumber each. Their advent in the
coast trade means that no more pile or
lumber rafts will be towed down the coast
this year.
Captain John Metcalf, Lloyd's surveyor
for California, has been appointed super
intendent of the Pacific Improvement
Company's steamers. The Southern Pa
cific has long been looking for a thor
oughly capable man to fill. this position,
and in Captain Metcalf they havo found
one who will fill the bill. A more com
petent or conscientious man than Cap
tain Metcalf could not be found on the
Pacific Coast. !
The United States transport - Sheridan
sailed for Seattle yesterday afternoon. At
that point she will load supplies for Ma
nila. Viut may call here on her way down
in order to take aboard some recruits for
General Otis.
The mail steamer Australia docked at
Pacific street wharf yesterday. She was
released from quarantine Wednesday and
went to the sugar refinery, where she dis
charged her cargo of sugar. She then
docked at Pacific street and at once be
gan receiving freight. She will sail again
Wednesday for Honolulu.

"Bob" Hogan Anxious to Be Appointed Lees
Successorâ Formally Announces His
Candidacy-New Appointments,*
DETECTIVE "BOB" HOGAN, WHO ASPIRES TO BE CHIEF
OF POLICE.
"All promotions in the de
partment shall be made from
the next lower rank, seniority
of service and meritorious ser
vice to be considered."
THAT is the language of section 1.
chapter VII of the charter. Upon
it those opposed to the candidacy
of Lieutenant Esola for the office
of Chief of Police base their hopes
that he will not be named as the succes
sor of Isaiah W. Lees. They hold that
the provision precludes the possibility of
his appointment over the present cap
tains, not to speak of the other lieuten
ants, his seniors on the force. Some stand
will undoubtedly be made upon this point,
although, in all likelihood, it will not aval]
to denrive Esola of the coveted prize.
It is stated that this provision of the
charter has been carefully considered by
the advisers of Esola and has been put
under the notice of the Mayor. In addi
tion, it is also said, his Honor and several
prominent attorneys consulted have given
It as their opinion that it is not necessary,
for a person to be eligible for the office of
Chief of Police, to be a member of the de
partment. This Interpretation of the pro
vision may be somewhat In the nature of
a hint concerning the plan of Esola to
overcome any objection to. his promotion
that may be raised by section 1. chapter
VII of the charter. It is as much as to
say there Is nothing to prevent him, when
the time comes, resigning his lieutenancy
and becoming a private citizen. The
transformation, then, from private citizen
to Chief of Police could be easily made as
indicated.
AVhether or not Lieutenant Esola con
templates such action is not announced.
It is plain, however. . that his so doing
might prove a staggerer for those who
pin their faith in his defeat on the word
ing of section 1, chapter VII.
Detective Robert Hogan has declared
himself a candidate for Chief of Police in
opposition to Esola. He is being warmly
supported by a number of lawyers and
business men, and is hopeful of victory.
When seen at his home last night Hogan
said: "Yes, it Is true that I have entered
the race for Chief of Police. I consider
that I am as much entitled to the office as
any of the candidates whose names have
been mentioned. My record as a detective
conclusively shows that I have the neces
sary abiiity to conduct the affairs of the
DEATH OF GEORGE BONNY.
Expired in Bordentown, N. J., After
an Active Life, at the Age of
Seventy-Three.
News was received in this city yester
day of the death of George Bonny, which

Bonny was connected. After awhile he
went East to get a rest and to visit his
relatives. Since then he has not been on
the coast. Death came from pneumonia.
Mr. Bonny was never Inclined to public
life. He was n member of the Paclflc-
Unlon Club and also a member of the So
ciety of California Pioneers. He never
married. Personally Mr. Bonny was
known as a genial, charitable man. He
was a favorite In the business estab
ment with which ho was con

all in their power to have me succeed
Lees, and unless I am very much mis
taken.l will capture t>r coveted plum."
Hogan nas been connected with the de
partment for a long number of years and
is considered one of the shrewdest detec
tives in the country. While engaged in
gathering evidence in the Benhayon mur
der case about ten years ago. Hogan ac
cidentally stumbled on Lees' corns and was
Immediately "shelved." Since then he has
been working- in the office of the Dis
trict Attorney, handling important crim
inal eases, and rendering meritorious ser
vice in convicting desperate criminal. A
number of the most prominent lawyers in
the city are exerting themselves to have
him appointed successor to ex-Chief Lees.

Deacon a new trial, though I doubt not
we could get a new trial by appealing to
the Superior Court on the ground of in
sufficiency of evidence. Deacon could have
been granted a new trial and nothing
would have been said except by the police
who made out a bad technical case and
feel disgruntled accordingly."
The pulse of public opinion, as felt on
the street shows things in a slightly dif
ferent light as regards the Deacon affair.
Judge Smith himself points to his action
in this case with pride, but fails to men
tion that the $100 fine Imposed was the
minimum under the statute. Nor is the
statement of Attorney Pulcifer that Dea
can could have been granted a new trial
without causing other than police objec
tion accepted without questionâ lt being
maintained that the granting of a new
trial in view of the evidence, introduced
would have caused a storm of protest and
criticism. Judge Smith also contradicts
Pulcifer by declaring that Rosenberg ate
at another table, the partition being re
moved between two rooms.
To say that the article In The Call
created a sensation in the city of Oakland
would be to put it very mildly. Nothing
else of any consequence was talked of
in the street, the opinion expressed being
generally unfavorable to the little party
whose gastronomic qualities were so
markedly developed Just before the time
for the herald of a new day to mount the
rear fence and sound his clarion note.
The feeling is not strongly censorious, but
rather of a deprecatory nature, a feeling
that Judge Smith's act was improper and
tended to lower the dignity of the er
mine.
Joe Rosenberg simply keeps still and
"saws wood." All efforts to get his ver
sion of the affair resulted in failure.
It Is likely that developments may arise
In a short time which will give the affair
a new aspect and everybody is on the
alert to gee what phase the case will next
assume.
POLICE JUDGE MORTIMER
SMITH of Oakland evidently
looks upon the publication of his
act In supping with two "crap"
players as a huge Joke. Not tak
ing Into consideration his Honor's choice
of associates, the impropriety of pander-
Ing to the whims of the gustatory nerve
in the company of men upon whose al
leged crimes he was arterward supposed
to tit In judgment hardly stems to have
struck him with the force of the prover
bial ton of brick.
True, as soon as he had read the article
In The Call In reference to his midnight
meal with Joe Rosenberg, the proprietor
of the house in which the gambling oc
curred, and S. J. Richardson, banker of
the came so dear to heart of the street
comin, Judge Smith developed an aggra
vated cape of Weyl*r fever and pummeled
an explanation out of his typewriting
machine, rinding a market for his output
n the local evening papers. Having fin
ished the work of pulling himself on rec
ord in nn-<le-siecle style, Gls Honor looked
upon the finished product and decided that
It was eood. Then he was ready l"-jr a
"JoFh." .
"What bothers me most, he said, was
The Call putting a bunch of poppies be
side my picture. I am undecided whether
they were meant to convey something un
favorable to me or were Inserted as a sort
af vague explanation that the whole arti
cle was a "pipe dream.'
This assertion, taken In conjunction
with the Judge's remarks about a "steer"
In taking him to the restaurant, and his
versatility In commenting on the "crap"
fame, rhows that as a josher he Is un
3oubtedly a heavy-weight. "If Deacon
Had tone on the stand and testified that i
there were no 'bones' thrown," he de- !
ilared, "I would have caused his arrest
for perjury."
Harry I J ulcifer, the attorney in the case.
Is inclined to look upon the situation as
nerious. He was so exceedingly cautious
about being quoted that as he gave forth
each sentence for publication he Jotted It
iown in shorthand upon a sheet of paper
placed before him, though freely admit
ting that all had dined at the same table.
â¢'The Judge and I are good friends," he
said, "and 1 have been out to supper with
Mm mar.y times before. The night of the
arrest, December 17, Joe Rosenberg and
Max Koenig, one of the bondsmen, went
out with me to gee him. Cash bail had
oeen given for all of the men arrested but
two, and our idea was to get Judge Smith
io approve the bonds of these two.
"We all went to the courthouse, where
the bor.ds were approved and filed. The
other two then departed and the Judge
went with me to the restaurant at my
suggestion. We did not expect to see
?ither Rosenberg or Sig Richardson there
and the case had been dismissed from ray
mind. It seems that the same idea oc
curred to the other two and we found
them at the restaurant when we got
there.
'The subject cf the arrests did come up
Â«t the restaurant, I believe, but the Judge
raid nothing of a compromising nature.
It is natural for a defendant's lawyer to
make out as strong a case for his client
tr. possible, and I suppose I did so to the
Judge. For this reason it was proper for
aim to say that If I represented things
:<irrect!y no case rested and the men
prould escape conviction. It was a mere
innocent remark on his part, and his fair
ness is Fhown by his conviction of Dea

SHIELDS CASE IS WITH
HIS BROTHER OFFICERS
CLOSING OF THE TRIAL BY
COURT -MARTIAL.
Lieutenant Eltinge, Counsel for the
Accused, and Major Groesbeck,
Judge Advocate, Sum
Up the Evidence.
The case against Chaplain Shields was
closed yesterday afternoon and It is now
in the hands of the officers composing the
court-martial. The session of yesterday
was taken up with the arguments of coun
sel for and against the accused, and when
the case was finished It looked a little
brighter for the preacher.
Lieutenant Eltlnge summed up the case
for the accused briefly but very much to
the point. He commented upon the fact
that but one of the witnesses for the pros
ecution had testified that he believed the
chaplain was drunk, and even he after
ward qualified bis statement. He called
to the minds of the officers of the court
that the other witnesses had all testified
that Shields was evidently suffering from
some ailment, but that none of them was
willing to say positively that he had been
drinking.
Regarding the charge of absence with
out leave. Lieutenant Eltinge called atten
tion to the fact that it amounted to that
only because Captain Bartlett, command
ant of the post at Alcatraz, could not give
verbal leave for more than twenty-tour
hours at a time, and that the accused,
having been taken sick during his leave,
was unable to return within the time al
lowed. He spoke of the present condition
of the chaplain and of the illness of his
family and he asked that in any event the
court deal leniently with him.
Major Groesbeck, judge advocate, then
summed up the case for the prosecution.
He declared that he believed every word
of the charges and specifications had been
fully proved, and he asked that the court
do justice accordingly. He said the fact
that tho accused was a minister but em
phasized the magnitude of his guilt, and
that he was ill and perhaps near the
grave the judge advocate thought was no
reason for a plea for mercy. There are
thousands, he said, who are In the same
condition, and they do not give way to
their vices; and it was doubly necessary
that a man whose duty it was to repre
sent the Master should himself show a
little of the example of self restraint
which he was supposed to teach. Major
Groesbeck also called attention to the fact
that the weakness of the chaplain had
shown itself before he entered the army,
and that when he accepted his commis
sion he did so with the knowledge of his
own infirmities.
This closed the case and the court room
was cleared to allow the members of the
court to deliberate. They will render a
decision in the case and this will be sent
on to Washington, from where It will
come out in orders, unless the finding be
one of acquittal. In that case it will
come out in orders from this department.
Acting Assistant Surgeon William W.
