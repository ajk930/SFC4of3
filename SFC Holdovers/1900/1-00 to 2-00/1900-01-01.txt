FATHER WYMAN AT
ST. MARY'S CHURCH
The Paullst -Fathers at St. Mary's
Church made a special feature of their
usual vesper service last night. At thÂ»
close of the benediction the German
choral "Te Deum" was sung by the choir,
composed of sopranos. Miss Paula, Miss
Higgins and Miss Johnson; contraltos.

by the Rev. Father Wyman. He said in
part: â¢
"This is a special year in the Catholic
church. The holy Father in Rome has
ordered that the opening of the new cen
tury shall be recognized by a midnight
niass or the day is to be marked with
some special form of praise. The ser
vices to-night will be followed by the
singing of the '-'Te Deum" as a sign of
our thankfulness "to God for his kindly
guardianship over us in the past. God
has given great blessings to the Christian
people in the past and the great blessings
that we may hope God will send will be
ours if we are only faithful.
ood works, as we know, in hidden yet
most effective ways, for the benefit of hla
people. The benefits of God are known
and most deeply appreciated by those who
think serously and most desire those
things which are of lasting value. The
superficial mind does not always see what
is most real and substantial and as a rule
has little appreciation of what it receives.
On the other hand, those who are guid
ed by divine wisdom find in the act 3 of
providence infinitely more blessings than
it is possible to suppose God would give
to such weak creatures as we are."
IMPRESSIVE MUSIC
AT ST. IGNATIUS
Services in St. Ignatius Crrireh last
night were solemn and beautiful. Th>
sacred edifice was brilllantlv ll S hteri anrl
was crowded with worshipers who offered
up thanks for blessings received during
the past year, and prayed for a con
tinuance of them during the next
twelve months. Rev. Father Prelato.
S. J., recited the Rosary and Litany
and then vespers, the responses being
made by Rev. Angelo Cptelll. S. J. The
choir augmented for the occasion by the
ladies' sodality choir rendered sweet
music durins the services. Rev. Father
Frieden, S. J., delivered the sermon. It
was an eloQuent.jelTort and. touched the
auditors In part he said:
"We have assembler! before God's altar
to-night to thank the Almighty for ths
good things that have come to us in the
course of the year which is now drawing
to its close.' Yes, the year is well nigh
passedâ out a few hours to remain. It is
for the last time in the year '90 that the
preacher speaks to you from this pulpit;
the last time you adore our Lord in the
Blessed Sacrament and receive his bene
diction. And what has become of 'the
year? The days which it wa<Â» made of
are no more â they have passed to eter
nity. And with the passing time, we our
selves have passed; and at the close of
the year we are one year nearer to eter
nltv - vi-v^ ?
"God grant to the members of this reli
gious community and to all those who
have recourse to our ministrations a sea
son of virtue and holiness; a time of such
happiness as can be had here below. May
we 'share in that sweet contentment of
soul, in that precious peace, which in
deed the world cannot give, but which is
the heavenly heritage of men of good will.
May the divine blessing descend upon your
household and may it ever dweii there.
May the great God bless those
whose descending years remind them
that eternity i 3 not far off; and
may he blesa the young, lest the health
and strength of body that God has be
stowed prove the. ruin of their virtue;
may the Almighty guide and bless the
rich, that they may prize the wealth of a
holy life and cling to the treasures of
heavenly merit: and may the same sweet
Lord graciously bless and console the
needy, that their poverty may help them
to lay up to themselves treasures in fieav
en. May he, who is so truly the Father
of all, bless you and yours when you
are in health, and may he blesa you
more abundantly when sickness
visits your houses: may the blessings of
God be upon you in the day of joy and
prosperity, and may it not depart from
you when in the unsearchable ways cf
Providence thÂ«> hand of the Lord has
touched you.
"That these blessings may come to you

wish you. from the bottom of our hearts,

SOLEMN SERVICES
AT THE CATHEDRAL
V The /closing > of > the . century * was . com
memorated iby_ the most, solemn arid .im?
-S the Catholic churches of this
fJT ( city last night services of a
most interesting and remarka
ble character were celebrated.
Never before in the lives of
.. the thousands that thronged
â¢ the sanctuaries was the theme
-ILi that cf l;st night, and never
again will any of those tnat
bowed the r heads in prayer do
co again f r the same purpose.
In obe4!ence to the Tope's decree Catho
lics soajrht their chirches to unite .in
praise and thanksgiv ng fcr the century
cf 'ife and progress 0 at was closing with
the r.lght. and to knctl In hope and plead
ing for the good that may come with the
century that would d. wn before the day.
At 7 o'clock the s.icred edifices were
crowded to the door;. The sanctuaries
were adorned as only for the great fes
tivals of the ecclesiastical year. The
splendid altars Mazec with a wealth of
lights and glistening ornament* that re
turned and reflected their dazzling beauty
c thousand fold. Borers of ferns and
palms and choicest flovers made a strik
ing forepround to the pirgeou? altars. Tne
rcene, beautiful in itself, won new sig
nificance from thn purpose for which it
Â¦was created. Here and there superbly
robed priests moved t" and fro In the va
rious phases of the sol^ mn service that in
its dignity and Impress veness was chant
ed as the last tribute of Catholic Chris
tians to the dying century.
Psalm? and soncs of praise floated from
organs and choirs In answer to the
chants of the vespor^ service. Then
&11 the vast congregations, assembled
In mai y churches, were on their
knees to receive the solemn benedic
tion which closed a . passing century
and welcomed a coming era. Splendid In
their ritualism, enhanced by the attending
n&gr.lflrence of lipht ar.d color and sound,
the eÂ«r\ices charmed the senses and held
the imagination. And the words spoken
from thÂ» pulpits were those of the tri
umphs and trials, the good and evil, of
the hundred years that had been counted
Into history..
In many of the sanctuaries the imposing
cererccr.ies of the night ended by the
singing of the Te Deum by the congrega
tions. The time and the occasion, the vast
throngs that flocked to so many places
cf worship, the splendor of decoration and
gorpreousness of ceremonial made the
went one that will be Jong remembered in
San Francisco.
By authority of the Pope's decree the
Catholics of this city could have partici
pated in the tacrilice of a midnight mass
In their churches. Suoh a spectacle is
unknown to the generation and it was
feared*^ that the churcl _s would be over
taxed And that some accident might hap
pen. VT^ar General Prendergast decided
therefore' tkat 10 mass would be cele
brated In"! any of the large local sanctu
aries. In chapels, however, there
was no restriction, and In them at the
hour cf mlrtrJght. at the very meeting of
in* oÂ«*t;;rieÂ».'fcvnSreÂ£s -f <lttle conrnvni
tles met 'at convent shrines to offer tnelr
praiwÂ» slt6 worship.
In connection with these remarkable
ceremonies the controversy regarding the
close of tfce century has received a local
Interest. RÂ«v. Father Peter C. Yorke.
â¢whose optnirn naturally is entitled to
great consideration, says that the cen
tury unquestionably closed last, nisht at
rrJdright and will :icf continue until mid
night of December Zl of this year, as
most of his disputants insist. The rev
erend gentleman argues that the Chris
tian era began with the birth of Christ
and not when the Savior was 1 year of
age; that In our calculations we must
begin with tte year naught and not with
the year on*. If this calculation be ob
served we will not count our years until
we have passed them and when we
register tha year 10W we have recorded
the passage of nineteen centuries.
THE GLORY OF A
CENTURY NOW DEAD
In no other Catholic church In the city
'perhaps were the services In honor of thÂ«
closing century more imposing than they
Â¦were at St. Peter's Church. The sacred
*aiflcÂ« was splendidly adorned as if for
the greatest festival of the ecclesiastical
year. Myriads of lights glistened and
flashed upon the altars. Palms and rare
plknte shed their fragrance &e4 gave new
; beauty to the sanctuary- The service was
as imposing and as dignified as a splendid
ritual could endow it. Solemn vespers,
the benediction and the -Te Deum were
chanted in honor of the century that was
dying. =â¢. 'is
The pas=u>r. Rev. Father Peter C. Torke,
was eloquent In his sermon. of the night.
His theme was the century that was dying.
In part he spoke as follows :
â¢â¢At the behest of the Holy Father, my
brethren, we celebrate this the last day of
the old year with solemn prayer and
t!iankspivir.Â£. Not only -do we close the
year, but we close the century. Therefore
there is a special reason why we should
look bark on the past hundred years and
glorify God, who has done such great
things fcr his church and people.
"A hundred" years aco the moral world
looked &h the physic*!' world may have
looked after the great deluge. The foun
dations of the rreat deep had been broken
up and th<- French revolution had swept
away the ancient landmarks in church
and state. Never had things looked so
black. Infidelity^ brutal and brutalizing,
â¢was rampant In the countries that had
remained faithful during rtse reformation.
In Protestant lands Catholics were the
eurvivcrs of three centuries of persecu
tion â co*ve<J., timid, without irioney. with
out volet-, without influenceâ the pebbles,
Â¦ sNewm'ar. saysâ thfd< tritus of the great
deluge. In America the Latin countries
wre tainted with the same disease as the
5101 norlands. In the United States we
â¢v-ere but a handful, deprived in most of
the Stairs of our rights as citizens or
but. n^wly enfranchised. Never had the
Papacy Â«unk s,o low. If it were possible
for the church to fail the beginning of
the century saw her failure.
"The darkest hour was bffore the dawn.
When the ctorra was at its height God
was ewcetly disposing all things
'for his own good purposes. â¢ The
early years of the century saw
'Â¦'.he restoration . of morality and
religion to Frange. Napoleon recognized
that there could" be r.o state unless God
was recognized and he brought back the
church, not for love of the church, but
because he thought he could use her.
\Yh<n he tried to bend her to his ambi
tion he found himself face to face with a
, power he could not conquer. The Pope
' went Into prison" rather than betray the
trust committed to him by Christ. Na
poleon fell as fall all those who make war
on God, but the Papacy remained. His
dynasty has gbne forever, but the church
! is Kill there.
"Not elnce the time when the prophet
seemed to be ended -forever. To-day her
walls are lifted up in beauty. . She re
sounds with the voice of gladness.' Her
children throng round the. altar and the
sacrifice is offered up from the rising- of
the sun to the going down' of theisame,
for the Lord hath promised the ; gates of
hell shall not* prevail.
"If the resurrection of the church In the
old world has been wondrous, not' less
wondrous has been Its planting* and- its
growth here ) In this new republic. A
hundred years . ago we were .nothing in

and be glad, not for selfish or personal
reasons, but because we. believe that God
has established his church for the bene
fit of mankind, and that it. Is to the ad
vantage of. all men to, belong to that
church. 'I would to God," said the
apostle, 'that , botii in a little and., in
much, not only thou but also all that
hear me . this Â¦ day should become
such as I also am, except these bands.'
That is our prayer for our fellow citizens.
pressive services at St. Mary's Cathedral,
Van Ness avenue and O'Farrell street,
last night. There were vespers and the
benediction, with the special feature of
the "Te Deum." Rev. Father Prendergast
preached a sermon appropriate Â¦to the oc
casion.^ fcr'r^ . .
Nearly every pew In the big cathedral
was occupied. The music was superb, es
pecially the solos. Father Prendergast
dwelt in his sermon upon the perishability
of time, and. sought to impress upon the
congregation the Importance and the duty
cf -taking advantage of. the precious gflt
of God. He said in part: â¢/,;â¢Â¦
from him -who controls 'all things. God Is
the source of life and the whole creation.
Timeâ so perishable and yet so precious
is the gift of our Lord and Father. The
good that it is to us can be measured by
its duration, the spiritual benefit we take
from it and the moral exultation we re
ceive. It partakes of the Immensity of
eternity.
"Why do men rejoice and exchange con
gratulations on New Year's day? Is It be
cause another year has rolled by and that
their allotted portion â¢ of - time has been
shortened to that extent?- Do those who
cheer and congratulate stop to think? No

correspondent:
FRERE CAMP. Dec. 31.-It Is stated
the Boer bridge below Mount Hlangwana
has been washed away, leaving some of
the Boers isolated on this side. The In
tended night bombardment of the Colenso
lines miscarried yesterday. Thorny
croft's Horse and a force of mounted in
fantry advanced toward Tugela River.
The Boers discovered them, as it was in
tended, turning their searchlight on the
men, and opened a heavy Mauser fire.
Our naval guns, which Were to have
seized an opportunity to cannonade the
enemy's trenches, did not fire. They
waited to hear musketry, but that was in
audible five miles away on a wet and
stormy night. So, after undergoing much
discomfort and floundering about'lnmud
and water, the troops returned to Ghieve
lev.
Much the same fate befell a recon
nolterlng force sent in the direction of
Mount Hlangwana. Our squadrons of
volunteers atttr much difficulty located
a force of Boers, who are now isolated
south of the Tugela ranges. Byings*
South African Light Horse, with two
guns, proceeded to their assistance, but
were unable in the darkness to find the
way or effect a junction for an attack.
Men and horses stumbled and fell into the
water. They were out all night and got
drenched, but returned to camp in the
morning.
Firing continues at Ladysmith' and aIBO
now at Chleveley. General Buller, with
Harts and Lytteton's brigades, is at
Frere. The Tugela River is still high.
Last night our 4.7-lnch naval guns decid
edly worried the Boers. * Two rounds of
lyddite which were fired at 3 o'clock in
the morning caused them to leave their
shelter The place is now honeycombed
with trenches. The Boers' guns are splen
didly protected and screened. Kraals,
d.-MiKa.s and trenches have all received at
tenrion from the sailors' guns, which
alone have flred since December 15. To
day, while firing, the enemy were engaged
from their works facing Colenso practi
cing in getting ranees and apparently us
ing ciyinon and Mausers. The natives
state tho enemy have mounted ten cap
tured field guns against us.
The Boers use the heliograph. They
watch and warn their men to take cover
when our big guns are ready to fire.
Thirty-one Boer wagons ha v been seen
at the Junction of Little and Blc'Tugcla
Rivers. An attempt will be made to de
stroy them. Saas*

Modder River, Dec. 26.â Christmas over,
we broke our rest by two reconnoissances
this morhlngr. One was three miles to
the right, where we destroyed two farm
houses, from which there had been occa
casional sniping. The other was on the
left. A squadron cf the Twelfth Lancers
and a company of mounted infantry ad
vanced to within 2500 yards of the Boer
position, when the enemy opened fire, dis
closing tho fact that they had advanced
their trenches. There were no casualties
except a few horses hit, yet for an hour
lively firing took place, In which even
the redoubtable "putt-putt," as the Vick

use by the Boers, and one of the 4.7-lnch
guns by our men.

No such hopeful view can be

Is by no mrans echoed here.
The latest I^adyÂ«=mlth advices show that
the Boers' Fhelling is becoming deadly,
*rhile sickness and *>nnui must be telling
Ftronjrly upon the garrison. The n*ws of
the spread of a rebellion among ,the Dutch
colonists and of the attempts of Boers to
cut the railway at widely different points
Is very disquieting as bearing upon the
safety of the extended lines of communi
cation.
All the correspondents are beginning to
hint of a forward movement on the part of
Oenerul Buller, the <?ar.jrer of which Is in
dicated in a dispatch to the Daily Tele
praph from Fr^ro recording the unfortu
nate failure of two reconnoissances. In
one case the Boer lines at Colenso were
to have be?n bombarded at night. Mount
ed men drew the Boer fire, and it was in
tended that the naval guns should bom
tiard. This, however, the latter failed to
co, owing to fome misunderstanding, and
the reconnoitering party was compelled to
flounder brck.to camp through the wet

According to the fame correspondent a

GERMANS ENRAGED BY
THE BUNDESRATH AFFAIR
BERLIN, Dec. 31.â Regarding the seiz
ure by the British cruiser Magicienne of
the Imperial mail steamer Bundesrath of
the German East African line, a high of
ficial of the German Foreign Office to
day, said:
"Silence must be preserved aX present
ebneerning the actual status of the ne
gotiations which have been begun with
Groat Britain about the' matter. Appro
priate steps have been taken, of which
Germany must await the result. The
matter is regarded by Germany as of the
utmost importance, because seriously In
volving the rights of neutrals."
This afternoon the Foreign Secretary
Count yon Bulow, conferred at the For
eign Office with his official advisers and
then reported to the Emperor. A Cabinet
meeting will consider the seizure.
,J l \ a , a ,*! s t rt^ d J n Government circles that
the British right to search is questioned,
and that In any event the British right to
stop passengers, whether they intend to
fight for the Boers or not, is strenuonely
disputed, as the vessel up6n which they
were 1b neutral and the territory to which
they were proceeding, namely, Delacoa
Bay, also is neutral. Redress, it Is as
eerted, will be insisted upon by Germany.
The German press to-day unanimously
condemns British action In the Bundee
rath seizure, which is characterized as
'an instance of gross insolence" and as
"calculated Â«gain to Illustrate the need of
a powerful Germany navy to render such
overbearance on the part of England im
possible in the future."
The .National Zeltung strongly argues
that England had no right to interfere
with the Bundesrath, and expresses the
hope that she has not adopted a flexible
theory regarding contraband.
The Lokal Anzeiger surmises that there
must have been a serious quarrel between
the commanders of the Bundesrath and
the Magiclenne before the latter officer
"overstepped his prerogative In carrying
off the steamer," and expresses the hope
that Germany will "speedily enforce the
release of the vessel."
Even the moderate Vosslsche Zeitunn;
calls the proceeding "characteristic Eng
lish Insolence," and adds that "the whole
attitude of the English before Delagoa
Bay provokes a general protest.".
It Is announced that the German pro
tected cruisers Condor and Schwulbe are
now on their way to Delagoa Bay.
BRITISH COLONISTS ARM
TO FACE INSURRECTION
CAPE TOWN,- Dec. 28.â The colonial
authorities are using every precaution to
prevent an Insurrection on the part of the
disloyal Dutch in Cape Colony and to
suppress a rising if one should occur.
Everywhere the British colonists are be
ing organised into home guards, drilled,
armed and ready to act in their respective
localities should armed Dutch colonials
rather. The theory is that the British
home-staying colonials should be fully
prepared to cope with the Dutch colonials
without the aid of regulars.
The alertness of the British makes uni
ted action on the part of the pro-Boer
residents difficult. Unable to act openly,
they slip away singly or in small groups
to Join the enemy's forces. The authorities
have been informed of many centers of
agitation, which it is considered undesir
able to particularize, but there is noth
ing like concerted action apparent over
the wide districts.
The case of Mr. Michan, solicitor to the
De Beors Company, who is accused of
treason, acquires Increased importance,
as he has been transferred from the cus
tody of the civil authorities here to the
military authorities at De Aar. His high
position causes the Dutch to watch his
case keenly.
Parties of Boers have been operating
some seventy miles south of Lord Meth
uen'B position. Boers appeared on Christ
mas day near the railway, about twenty
nine miles south of De Aar. A British
force appeared to engage. them, but the
enemy retired.

trol camp during the night of Wednesday,
LADYSMITH BOMBARDED
WITH PLUM PUDDING
NEW CENTURY
A YEAR HENCE
Thus Declares Camille
Flammarion.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyright, 1899, by James Oordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Dec. 31.â The Herald's Euro
pean edition publishes the following letter
from Camille Flammarion, the eminent
astronomer and chronologist:
Every hundred years, toward the end of each,
century, this question of th 4 date of the change
of century Is discussed. I have before me docu
ments of 1799. 1Â«99 and 1599, which pose the
pi-oblem and turn It over and over. Again, a
hundred years hence, In the year of grace IPU9â
which, by the way, tvlll be favored by a very
fine eclipse of the sun, total In the neighborhood
of Paris on August 11, at twenty-eight minutes
past 10 o'clock In the morningâ our great grand
children will put the s?me question. Again, in
fin de slecle newspapers of the period, there
will etill be distinguished rnlnds to repeat the
centuries' old confusion. .
Christ was born in the year at Rome 749, not
in T52, and died at the ag? Of 87, not 11, and the
whole Christian era la fcur year* too young. â¢
But It would certainly bÂ« inconvenient to
change it, although thiÂ« mistake has been
known for some centuries. It is sufficient If
people are agreed. It is clearly a matter of
convention.
There have also been variations in the date
of the beginning of the year, which has been
placed sometimes at January 1 and sometimes
at Deccrhberv 21. The year was shortened by
ten days in 1582 to bring the calendar Into
agreement with astronomy; but all this does
not prevent the last day of 1900 being the last of
the nineteenth century.
It may be seen by reading newspapers that
there are still dissenters in Paris, In the prov
inces and abroad. These simply complain that
the flirt year is called the year 1 Instead of the
year 0. but It was thus that the calendar was
drawn Up.
It la, therefore, on December SI. 19C0, at mlA
nlght. precisely, that the century will end, and
fall in its turn into an abyss* of the past to
t. ike room for the new century.

DIFFERENCES IN
CHINA SETTLED
Valuable Concessions to
Three Powers.
fepeclal Dispatch to The Call.
. WASHINGTON, Dec. Sl.â The announce
ment that the extension of the foreign
concessions at Shanghai, China, has been
finally approved brings to a close a dip
lomatic controversy between Great Brit
ain and the United States and France
wh'ch at times became rather acute,
France taking the position at one staga
of the negotiations that the co-oporation
v."ith the British in opposing the French
plan of extension was an unfrlendl/ act
toward France. =This and other Â«llflet
envÂ«is' have been happily adjusted, ac
cording to announcements from China,
which arc borne out by the information
of otlicialn here.
The controversy assumed an Interna
tional scope when the three colonies at
Shanghaiâ British, French and American
-âsought to extend their limits. Tne con
cessions are just outride of the old na
tive city and lie^along the rker Chang 1
Poo, near the point where It Join* the
Tang-tse-klang. They are chiefly impor
tant because Shanghai is the foremost
port of entry for foreign trade In the Chi
nese empire. The French settlement is
nearest the city and fronts on the river.
Next comes the British settlement and
then the American. ThÂ» French desir*
was to extend its settlement so as to
take In a large area back of the old city,
including five American missionary Insti
tutions. The British Government opposed
this extension .-quite vigorously.
. The British .-plan of extension was for
an "international settlement," running
from the rear of the British concession
up to the native city. France in turn
protested apainst it on the ground that
she would be entirely surrounded, with
out exit, except by the river, the native
city or over British territory. The Unitrd
States approved the plan of an interna
tional settlement, as the American inter
ests were substantially similar to those
of the British, but the American attitude
did not include an indorsement of all the
contentions made by the Jritish. It was
to this course of the American Govern
ment that France took exception, on the
ground that it was an unfriendly act to
France. The negotiations, while assuming
no outward show of warmth, were car
.ried on with some briskness, Embassa
tlbr Cambon of France presenting the
French side up to a few' months ago.
The adjustment finally reached is satis
isfactory to all parties concerned. The
French concession is extended, without
Including the American missions. The
British and American settlements are ex
tended and to some extent merged in the
international settlement, but the British-
American extension does not so envelop
the French colouy as to place It in a
pocket.
. The vnlup'a of the several concessions is
considerable, as the population of Shang
hai Is about COO.OOO. of which the greater
part Is in the foreign settlement. Here the
foreigners have- the right to carry on
trade and control property, and also have
their own courts, police and an organized
military establishment.

PLANNED TO MURDER
THE FOREIGN CONSULS
Filipino Plot for a Rising in Manila
on the Day of Lawton's Funeral
Frustrated.
MANILA,- Dec 31.â Four â¢ explosive
bombs, a few stands .of- arms and, 500
rounds of animunition'were discovered in
a house in the center of Manila this morn-
Ing while the' police were seeking Recarte,
the insurgent leader, who was said to
have come to. Manila in the hope of effect-
Ing an outbreak yesterday by taking ad
vantage of the mobilization of the Ameri
can troops at General Lawton's funeral^
To-day it developed that the plot In
cluded the throwing of bombs among the
foreign consuls attending the ceremonies,
in order to bring about international com
plications. These, it seems., were to have
been thrown from the Escolta's high
buildings, but the avoidance of the Es
colta by the funeral procession spoiled the
plan.
The populace. It is thought, had been
prepared for the attempt by a rumor cir
culated widely among the natives yester
day that Aguinaldo was in Manila and
would possibly lead the outbreak.
The American authorities, .having been
advised of what was brewing, prepared
for all contingencies. Captain Morrison,
who commands the troops in the most
turbulent district of this city, says he
does not believe an actual uprising will
ever occur, as the natives lack the reso
lution to take the. first steps In a move
ment that would entail fighting at close
Quarters with the American troops.
An American advance In Cavite
Province, south of Manila, Is expected
shortly. Reliable reports from native
spies show that there are upward of 2000
organized insurgents under arms within
a mile of Imus. They are strengthening
their entrenchments and possess artillery.
. At Novaleta the Filipino entrenchments
have been much strengthened since Gen
eral Schwan's advance. A thousand of
the enemy are in that vicinity and there
are 600 at San Francisco de Malabon.
From twelve to a hundred men will gar
rison each of the towns "in the southern
part of Cavite Province, and the same
may be said of the towns in Batangas
Province. N . 'â¢'.â¢-;â¢Â¦-
The provinces of North Camarines and
South Camarines hold quantities of hemp,
which the people cannot market. As a
consequence, the population in that part
of Luzon is suffering from lack of food.
lUce now costs four times . itÂ« normal
price.
â¢ It is estimated that 1000 insurgents an*
centered at Calarnba. Reports have been
received that 2000 insurgents are massed
at Mount Ayrat, having a strong- position
which commands steep and narrow trail?,
and that they are prepared to roll
bowlders down upon advancing troops.
Life along the roasts of the provinces of
Cagayan and North and South Ilocoa is
resuming normal conditions. The Ameri
can troops occupy the important towns
and patrol the country roads. The natives
implore the Americans to continue the
occupation, to establish a settled govern
ment and to terminate the uncertainty,
abuses and confiscations that have char
acterized the rule of the Tapallo revolu
tionists during the last eighteen month?.
. Incoming Spanish prisoners declare that
Apuinaldo has ordered the release of all
Spenish prisoners now in possession of the
rebels. V
The transport Zaflro has arrived at Ma
nila, bringing General Tinano. who is
much grieved at being supplanted by
Colonel Hood as military Governor of
Capayan Province. He hesitates to land,
because he looks upon Manila as a nest
of insurgents who may assassinate him
because he surrendered Caprayan. He
says that when Colonel Hood arrived the
presidents of all the towns in the province
repaired to Aparrl and begged him to
continue them In their positions*, saying
also that the natives desired to be rid
of the presence of the Macabebes, the
friars and the colored American sol-Hera,
toward whom they entertained a violent
antipathy..
Sixty-eight nick men out of Major
Bachelor's command of 120 are coming to
Manila.
Bringing Lawton's Body.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31.â The departure
of the transport Thomas from Manila
with the remains of Major General Henry
W. Lawton aboard was announced In a
dispatch received- at the War Department
from .General Otis to-day. The vessel
comes to the United States via Nagasaki.
She also has aboard the remains of the
late Major John A. Logan.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 81.â In a rage of
jealousy Mrs. Walter S. Moore to-day
publicly chastised her husband, who,' as
Chief of the Los Angeles Fire De
partment, is the best known individual In
this city. For some time Mrs. Moore has
questioned the fidelity of her spouse. To
obtain direct evidence the Fire Chief has
for weeks been under the surveillance of
private detectives.
For his known relations with other wom
en Mrs. Moore last spring administered to
her recreant husband his first public whip
ping. The object of Mrs. Moore's pres
ent concern is Mrs. J. Jones, who with
her husband, resides at 1975 East Second
street; Boyle Heights, and whom she di
rectly charges with undue intimacy with
the Chief.
On Friday Mrs. Moore appeared at the
Jones' house and demanded admittance,
but this was refused by the handsome
blonde, who had the place barricaded. So
great "was the- disturbance between the
two women that Mrs. Marx, a neighbor,
was made ill and fainted from fright.
At 8 o'clock this morning MrÃ. Moore
went to the Jones cottage and broke in a
window, through which she gained access.
In the. bedroom Mrs. Moore found a skirt
that belonged to her own wardrobe. The
scene in the cottage can be imagined
when the women met.
Mrs. Moore, afterward drove down the
streets of Los Angeles In a buggy and saw
her husband opposite thÂ« Nadeau Hotel
In conversation with Detective Steele.
When their eyes met Moore boarded a
car and Mrs.- Moore frantically whipped
up her team and kept pace with the car.
At Broadway and Second street Moore
Jumped from the car. Mrs. Moore also
took a'runnlng leap from her buggy, and
proved a better sprinter than her hus
band. On a vacant lot facing Hill street
they met. After the melee both were
covered with blood, Moore's face being
lacerated by the finger nails of the irate
woman. Flushed with victory, Mrs. Moore
forced the Chief to accompany her to the
Jonos cottage. Here a domestic upheav
al followed that is worthy of it Byronlc
pen.
Mrs. Moore, before her marriage, was a
Miss Lanfranco, the family being re
spected and wealthy. She also Is the
sister of Walter S. Maxwell, an applicant
for office under Governor Gage. A long
determined desire to apply for a divorce
on the part of Mrs. Moore will- shortly be
realized.
December 27. This was near Victoria road.
An attempt was made not far from that
point to damage the railway. One man
was caught In the act and shot.
A similar attempt was made between
Multlersoletl and Klapmuts, but the
would-be wreckers escaped. Like attempts
are reported from several other points.
Evidently small parties of Boers or Dutch
colonials have been trying to intferrupt
the movement of trains, but thus Tar they
have been baffled by the elaborate Brit
ish patrolling.
In one case a patrol of regulars fired on
a patrol of colonials. The latter were
wearing broad-brimmed hats, and were
mistaken by the British for Boers. No
casualties occurred, but in consequence
of the incident an order has been issued
requiring Â«dl classes of troops to wear

REAL SCOPR OF THE
TREATY WITH PORTUGAL
BERLIN, Dec. 31.â Despite the semi-of

German papers believe in the existence of
a secret treaty concerning Delagoa Bay,
but they discredit thei statements of the

Hamburgcscner Corresponclenz says:
"The treaty has no definite form, and It
wouUt come into force only In case Portu
gal Fhpuld consent to sell a portion of her
colonize. It is confined solely to her
African possessions. Russia has seen the
treaty, and has offered- no objections."
The Vosslscho Zeltung also asserts that
the treaty does not mention Portugal's
Asiatic possessions. -

They have managed to get large orders
sent for shipment here by French and
German steamers. Prices have advanced
50 per cent In consequence and the stocks
are very short. Something like a famine
is threatened, as the British Government
is stopping all goods consigned to this
place â¢ from s coast ports.
"Several members of the Volksraad
meet every steamer, doubtless to give lur
ther. orders. Portugal is doing her best
to maintain neutrality, but, following
opinion In Louronzo Marquez, i s generally
in favor of actively assisting the Boers
to produce food supplies.
"Herr Pott, the Transvaal Consul Gen
eral, here. Is losing Lloyds' agency and
the agencies for the Castle, Union and
Bucknall steamship lines in consequence
of the position he holds."

excitement to-day among members of the
Irish Volunteers and Clan-Na-Gael -over
news of the capture of a German, ship
by a British man-of-war and the seizure
of alleged recruits for <he Boer army.
Within the last few da^ys recruiting for
South Africa has greatly agitated the
Irish Volunteers, the New York repre
sentatives of the large military organiza
tion which the Clan-Na-Gael estaollshed
throughout the country a few years ago.
It is known that a number of Clan-Na-
Gael men are now in South Africa, pre
paring to receive all the recruits that the
order can send there:
Although every movement of the volun
teers is guarded with the greatest secrecy
a^nd the highest offltlals deny know
ing anything about it, there is a perfect
understanding between official representa
tives of the South African republics and
the heads of the Irish physical force
party, by which the members of the first
regiment, Irish Volunteers, will be trans
ported to the Boer country.
. The Irish Volunteers were organized in
December, 1895. by Colonel James Moran,
acting under authority of the Clan-Na-
Toledo, hn3 instituted a movement to as
sist the Boers. This club in ISOS organized
the Emmet Guards and offered their serv
ices for the war with Spain. At a secret
meeting last night resolutions were
adopted pledging iinancial and moral sup
port to the Boers and offering assistance
of men if required. Fifty-five volunteers
offered their services, "in any emergency
In which England is involved.'*
non-combatants . a result which .the British
arms have failed to accomplish.
Resolved. That we deprecate the action of the
Dominion of Canada In sending troops to de
feat the lioers and protest against any part of
this continent being used as a base of opera
tions for the tonquf-st of a free nation in any
part "of the world as a menarÂ« to the peace
afad happlnecs of the American people.
Ilesolved, That we appeal to the heart and
conscience of the liberty-loving people, de
scendants of the founders of this republic and
lnheriters of Washington's fame, and all
lovers of liberty throughout the world, to cast
aside all personal and selfish consideration un
worthy of free mm and extend the hand of fel
lowship to the patriots and heroes now s^
bravely fighting to maintain their liberty and
to drive the Invader from the soil of the Boer
republic, and we haJl the victories as the happy
augury of the establishment of the United
States of South Africa.
IRISH RECRUITS FOR
THE TRANSVAAL ARMY
NEW YORK. Dec. 3Lâ There was much
republics in Soutk Africa one of justice and
right, as against the encroachment of the
avaricious British intruder, we heartily rejoice
in the splendid success thus far attained by the
brave defenders of these two republics In their
sewral encounters with the British hireling
army, sincerely hoping that complete success
may crown the truly patriotic efforts of the
Boers and that the oppressor may be deservedly
humiliated and driven from the soil of South
Africa In disgrace.
Resolved, further. That we acknowledge with
unbounded satisfaction and delight the course
Senator Mason of Illinois has pursued and hlÂ»
eloquent pleading In a speech before the Senate
of the United States in favor of the righteous
cause of the Boers; and we urge him to con
tinue the good work and thus assist in develop
ing an intelligent and healthy public sentiment
In regard to this important question of public
policy and the attitude the United States Gov
ernment ought to pursue in the premises.
IRISHMEN OF TOLEDO
VOLUNTEER TO FIGHT
TOLEDO, Ohio. Dec. 31.â The Robert
Emmet Club, a leading Irish society, of
Gael. No man may* be a member, of the
volunteers before becoming an out-and
out Clan man and having his antecedents
'thoroughly investigated. The purpose of
this military organization was announced
at. the time to be to take advantage of
any crisis fn English affairs, caused either
by home' -Insurrection or a foreign war.
A prominent member, of the Clan-Na-Gael
said to-day: .
"This is the precise occasion that was
in my mind when wo organized the volun
teer movement. If they can be of no
service now it Is doubtful whether they
ever could,* and if they do not figure In
this war It Is likely the movement will be
abandoned."
"What is the estimated strength of the
Volunteers In America?" he was asked.
"Prom the latest returns I should say It
is about 22,000, most of whom are in the
larger cities."
Colonel Lynch, commander of the Irish
Volunteers, was very non-oommunlcatlve
when asked about the connection of the
Volunteers with the -Boer war.
"I cannot speak of the private affairs or
the organization." he said, "and as for
the report that we have an understanding
with the Transvaal. I know nothing about
It. I know nothing about an Invasion of
England or Canada, either."
"Will the seizure of the German ship
prevent further *Boer recruiting among
the Volunteers?" he was asked.
"I have not "admitted that we have been
so recruiting." he said.
Further than this the colonel would not
speak. '

Epeciai Dispatch to The CsJ
BOSTON. Dec. SI.â A morning paper has
thÂ» following: The Fenlar.s aro engaged
in storing vast quantities of dynajnite.
lyddite ammunition and supplies in a few
selected repositories in remote rural dis
tricts of Vermont and Maine, rear thÂ«
Car.adian boundary. This is the most
active move yet taken in the plans for the
Invasion of Canada. Dynamite has been
6tored underground In a number of
masked excavations ar.d caves on the
Vermont border, while great quantities
of canned meats have been hidden in
barns owned by sympathizing fanners on
the Maine line near New Hampshire.
A large and efficient ambulance corps
Is being organized under the supervision
of a few loyal Irish women and surgeons
â¢who were iii the Red Cross work in Cuba.
They are preparing a large number of
rirst-aid packages for the invading force.
One phase of the campaign plans which
has entirely escaped notice heretofore is
that effecting the farming districts of
New England. The general supposition.
cf course, is that the movement is the
work of the Irish element of the larger
cities of the country, but it is a fact that
work is being done among the farmers,
who can furnls-h wagons and horses and
oxen for transportation purposes, as this
Is regarded as a most important detail.
A careful study is beir.p made of the
fmall road branches in Northern New
Knjrland and places are being located
where the roads could be captured by a
very small force.
GOTHAM MASS-MEETING

Senator Mason of Illinois, Congressman

The proscenium, the boxea and the balco

of American flags, the green Irish em

two South African republics. Justice Fitz
gerald, aiter calling the meeting to order,
said:
It it a er**X honor to be asked to speak to
this great au4lence to-night i.nd to Join in ex

I aia not ashamed to have It known that my
fympathy is witii the heroic Boers in their
resolute endeavor and determined effort 'to
n.aintain their homes anfl their Independence
â¢ (ra'.nst the piracy and tyranny of the Biitlsh
crown. 1 want to see them v.in In this con
tent because they are right and deserve to win.
la my judgment nine-tenths cf the American
j>eopie are against England in this matter and
la sympathy with the South Alrlcan patriots.
The courage of the iso*Â»rs in the face of tre
mendous odds has challenged the admiration
of mankind, and their heroism asainst almost
insurmountable obstacles has won the respect
of the civilized world. They ire entitled to our
sympathy, and we would be false to ourselves
and to ail ou.r history M we did nat give it to
thÂ«-m.
The South African patriots are white rnÂ«>n.
They are a good deal like the patriots of our
own revolution. They love their homes, their
freedom and their liberty. They' come from
gooi old Saxon ancestors from th* north of
Europe. They are fWh of our flÂ«-Â«h and bone,
of our b^mo. They love free institutions the
*ame as we do for the sake of personal liberty.
It comes to ti'in naturally and by inheritance.
Tli^ir love of liberty is not of a day nor of a
year, but of centuries. They have never be*>n
conquered, and. in my opinion, no matter what
cthTte may think, they never will be.
The story of the struggles and hardships of
those brave men in South Africa is one of the
tx-\ lint page* !n a '" history â an rmpertshab'.e

tal neglect, the metal mining interests
of the State will receive some measure of
valuable service from the Mining Bureau
will gratify the miners. It is one encour
aging feature of the Mining Bureau mess.
Mr. Storms Is a man of excellent scien
tific and technical attainments. After
some years of mining experience In Da
kota and Colorado ho came to California
and from ISI>2 to ISD6 was connected with
the Mining Bureau as field assistant dur
ing portions of the Nolan and Crawford
administrations. His bulletin on Meth
ods of Mine Timbering has had wider de
mand and circulation than any other bul
letin issued by the bureau. His field work
was mainly In the mother lode region
during those years and some of the most
valuable chapters in three of the reports
are by him. This work and a later ex
perience of his own In mine operation
nave made him especially familiar with
the mother lode and the scientific and
practical features and problems of Its
mining industry- He is also well ac
quainted with the rest of the mining field
in California. For some months he has
had editorial charge of the Mining and
Scientific Press. The leading' mining men
will undoubtedly approve his appoint
ment, whatever they may think of the
discouraging state of the administration
of the Mining Bureau.
Now Storms will range through the
mother lode region and north of it, "doing
scientific, descriptive and statistical work
not yet definitely planned. Bowers will
work somehow according to counties, and
Watts will stick to the oil fields and bos 3
the work in the Governor's name. All
will get up a lot of matter for publication.
How much of it and when will depend
on the money available. Gage started In
by setting aside $2000 of his $20,000 for the
two years for this purpose, but it Is not
very far that will go with illustrated re
ports and bulletins. He wanted some of
the $7500 allowed extra for printing by the
Legislature, but the State Mineralogist
happened to have a grip on that and
wouldn't yield a cent. During the hot
disagreement between Gage and State
Mineralogist Cooper the latter threatened
to close the laboratory for lack of funds,
and the Governor conceded $2500 of hi 9
$20,000 for its support. This leaves him
$14,600 to divide as he pleases between ex
perts and publications before July 1, 1901.
In fact, there are no strings In his meth
od of disbursing it in the mining field.
The other mining bureau is already put
ting forth matter from the State Printing
Office. Bulletins Nos. 13 and 14. giving In
tabulated form the mineral production of
the State by counties for 1597 and 1533
have been received from Sacramento and
are ready for distribution. They are sin
gle wall sheets, 24 by 33 inches in size and
uniform in style with others of recent
years.
In a few days a map of the Oil City oil
field will be out. It is a geographical and
topographical map, 18 Dy 20 inches, of
twelve sections, of outline nature, giving
no claim boundaries or geological fea
tures, showing about twenty unidentified
wells, and is valuable and convenient as
a map on which claims can be easily de
lineated.
Mr. Cooper's extensive and valuable bul
letin on the genesis of petroleum and as
phaltum in California is being printed and
will be issiied before long. He proposes to
follow this with the county mining maps
and registers, which have been walling
for publication so long, probably starting
with Siskiyou County.
It looks as though the dual State Min
ing Bureau would run along this way for
some time. Gage's illegal private bureau
promises to swing and flourish because no
one will legally question ft and because
Gage is able to muster political, moral
and immoral support. Cooper is not dis
posed to contest it, contenting himself
with refusing to know anything about it
and confining himself to the ferry build
ing quarters. The five trustees are keep
ing mum. A majority stand by the Gov
ernor and the minority attends to its own
business. So Cooper stands by himself
and doesn't kick a stone wall. The trus
tees agreed to sign' the bills of the Gov
ernor's bureau as a matter of form, but
decided that he must sign them first aa
he was running the outside department.
So the salary and expense bills of Messrs.
"Watts, Storms and Bowers will go first
to the Governor's office for his O K.
Then in San Francisco Secretary Durden
will chase around for the signatures of
the busy trustees and then Gage will pass
on them again as a member of the Board
of Examiners. The November and De
cember bills will probably go through the
Board of Examiners like greased eels at
the January meeting.
Uncle Sam is doing a good deal for the
mining industry which the State is not
doing for itself. Comparatively few are
familiar with the monographs, reports
and maps issued by the Geographical
Survey. George H. Eldridge, U. S. G. 5.,
is making an exhaustive study of the
bituminous resources of California. He
began In Santa Cruz County a month
ago, is now in Santa Barbara County and
will probably spend some months on his
studies. His resulting report should be
of great value.
Last week two of the big gold dredges

ROBERTS AND KITCHENER.
POPULAR sentiment in Great Britain gives un
qualified approval to the action of the Ministry
ia sending General Roberts as commander in
chief to South Africa, with General Kitchener as chief
of staff. These two men are for this generation the
military heroes of the empire, and the conclusion in
the British mind is that when they take command
there will be an end to blundering and a straight
march to certain victory.
Military experts, however, are not so sanguine as
the people. They recall that neither Roberts nor
Kitchener has ever fought a foe led by skillful gen
erals, trained in the tactics of modern war and armed
with the weapons of civilization. The experience Rob
erts had in fighting the wild tribes of India and that of
Kitchener in destroying the fanatics of the Soudan
has hardly furnished them with lessons of any great
value in the war they are now about to undertake,
and for that reason the military critics claim their
ability to grapple with the problems of the conflict
before them cannot be taken for granted by reason of
their successes in the past.
It has also been noted by some of these critics that
Roberts is a comparatively old man and has lived his
life in the exhausting climate of India, so that he
will hardly at the age of 67 have much vigor for
active campaigning. On the other hand, Kitchener
if not only a young man, but is one of the young men
who have a contempt for old men in war. He took
none but young men with him to the Soudan and he
has been quoted as saying if he had his way he would
retire from the army every officer over 50 years of
age. From that difference between the two some
critics predict there is likely to be friction between
the commander in chief and the chief of staff and that
the result will be the retirement of one or the other
before the war is over.
One thing is certain, Roberts and Kitchener will
have a much better chance to win fame than Buller
has had. In the first place they will have the benefit
of his disastrous experience in making direct attacks
upon entrenched Boers and they will not make blun
ders of that kind. Moreover, they are to have better
artillery and a larger force of cavalry. They will thus
have many advantages over the unsuccessful general
who started so boldly to march to 'Pretoria before
Christmas, but who up to this time has not succeeded
even in relieving Ladysmith.
Another great advantage will be derived from the
increased confidence which will be given to the Brit
ish troops by the knowledge that Roberts is to com
mand them. According to all reports that come to
us Roberts is one of those rare men who have the
magnetic power of rousing their followers to the
highest levels of courage and endurance. He is the
idol of the army and it is a foregone conclusion that
whatever British pluck can do to win laurels for him
will be done.
TO BE DONE FORTHWITH.
\\ AYOR PHELAN'S reason for vetoing the
/ \ order of the Supervisors imposing a license
tax upon nickel-in-the-slot telephone machines
is sufficiently valid to justify him in his action, pro
vided he keep the promise made in the veto to submit
to the Supervisors "forthwith" a new resolution to
the same purpose. The reason, however, will not be
deemed good by the people if it turn out to be no
more than another means of delaying the issue and
taking it out of the hands of this board.
The Mayor's words are worth noting. He says:
"The only reason for my objection is that City and
County Attorney Lane advised the board before the
passage of the order that it was illegal and would not
stand in the courts. If this is true it would be of no
value bnt only expense to the city to enact the order,
and if it is not true it could only be determined after
i suit in which the City and County Attorney himself
would have to defend the action, and having given an
opinion against the validity of the order he would be
jn no position to defend it. In conterence with him
we have agreed to submit an order which will answer
the Jejral objections. It will be forthwith submitted
f tc your honorable board for enactment.
Lndcr the circumstances, as the term of the present
board is about to close, the Mayor s promise to sub
mit Ins revised order forthwith will have no value to
anybody except the telephone corporations, unless it
mean the order shall be submitted to the board at its
meeting on Tuesday. If it be not so submitted the
Supervisors should pass the former order over the
The reasons for prompt action in this matter are
imperative. The present Board of Supervisors has
undertaken the legislation embodied in the order and
is entitled to the credit and the honor of carrying
it to success. It is well known that the telephone
corporations are fighting for delay. They have Â«ousrht
to obtain it upon one excuse or another ever since
the ort.cr was introduced. They are. urging it now
and the Mayor will play into their hands if he make
delay. The new board might pass the order if sub
mitted to them, but their, action is uncertain, while
that of the present board is certain. It is not exne
a:ent to take chances with a monopoly so wily and 50
prafpmg as that which controls our telephone system.
Let the order be submitted and enacted forthwith.
have a limit of 2300 yards. The new
ones are of the continuous bucket t>pe
30 by SO feet in size, and designed to
reach thirty feet below water and to
stack tailings thirty-five feet high. There
will then be in the Feather Riven near
Oroville, five dredges of the Postle
thwalte type, two of the scoop type and
a continuous bucket dredge of Eastern
design.
The Feather presents exceptional op
portunities for successful dredging en
terprises In the neighborhood of Oroville,
and they will multiply in the future.
Thousands of acres of that river bottom
will average 15 cents per cubic yard from
grass to bedrock, and the bedrock Is
within reach and soft enough to be prac
tically dug up by the scoops. The iuba
has not proved as good a dredging field as
was anticipated, partly on account of the
deep deposits of comparatively barren
detritus and partly because the stream
shifts its bed so frequently.
The dredging people are generally close
mouthed about their affairs, and no relia
ble statement of the gold prtoduct by
dredging can be given. R. H. Postle
thwaite, who is in an exceptional position
for Judging, estimates the total product
for 1839 at between $150,000 and $200.0<j0.
Some of the present dredges have worked
but a few months. New dredges now
building and the continuous operation of
all should greatly enlarge the output dur
ing 1900. The one operating at Mississip
pi Bar, 150 feet above the American, haa
been making money for eight months,
and the one at Lowden's ranch, up on the
Trinity, has been running successfully for
eighteen months. ..-Â¦:Â¦Â¦ -
On the Feather dredges have handled
gravel during the year at an average total
cost of less than 5 cents per cubic yard.
There are several new dredging enter
prises in process of negotiation and a
number of dredges will undoubtedly be
built during the year. When there are
considered the successes now established,
the hundreds of square miles of aurifer
ous ground that can be worked in no
other way and the Increasing interest in
this safe field, it can be confidently pre
dicted that gold dredging in California
will soon yield upward of $1.000 000 annu
ally and add more to the gold product
than hydraulic mining does now.

THE OLD YEAR AND ITS RECORD.
NOW and then expectations are realized in this
uncertain world, and the :Commercial year of
! 1899 was one of these pleasant exceptions. In
volume of business and magnitude of profits it broke
all previous records. Indeed, it exceeded the most
sanguine anticipations in the upward movement of
values. Taking the bank clearings of the country
as an index the volume of business was 74 per cent
larger than in 1897 and 51' per cent larger than in 1892,
the year preceding the panic. The failures, too, were
the smallest in seventeen years, but the collapse of
speculation in copper and the consequent failures in
Boston a week or two ago added over $18,000,000 to
the year's liabilities. ' Including this serious amount
the liabilities in 1899 were $120,000,000, of which $89,
260,000 were commercial and the balance banking,
most of the latter being charged up to Boston, and
within a fortnight. The average of liabilities to fail
ures was $9500, the smallest average in twenty-five
years. The best showing of the year was made by the
Southern and Pacific States, where the decrease in
failures from 1898 was 33 per cent. The railroads
added their share to the general prosperity, their. gross
and net receipts exceeding all records' Railroad
building was the heaviest since 1890, double the aver
age of the preceding four years and 50 per cent more
? 1 :â ,o^,o
The* export trade of the country made an equally
fine showing. It footed up almost $1,280,000,000, or
about 3 per cent over 1898, which was the largest pre
vious year. Manufactured goods are credited with
most of the gain in 1899, as breadstuffs and cotton
fell off 15 per cent each, the latter in consequence
of a decreased crop, and cattle and hogs 12 per cent.
The imports from foreign countries during the year
amounted to about $800,000,000, which gives us a
total foreign trade of about $2,000,000,000, which, it
is unnecessary to say, has never been equaled. It was
a manufacturers' rather than a producers' year, as
manufactured products advanced in price all around,
with a greatly increased output, while cereals declined
about 6 per cent, with diminished shipments abroad.
Metals advanced about 50 per cent over 1898. The
other advances are in raw cotton and wool, coal, hides
and leather, provisions of all kinds and live stock,
not to mention hundreds of lesser products. The ap
preciation in wool was 35 per cent and in cotton 29.5
per cent. The heavy increase in imports of raw ma
terial during the year shows the intense activity of
our manufacturing plants. The balance of trade in
favor of the United States, while not as large as in
1898, owing to the increase in imports, still aggre
gated an enormous amount.
The prospects for the coming year are fully as flat
tering as on January I, 1809. Most manufacturing
lines have entered the new year with order books
filled from three to six months ahead. The. iron out
put is contracted for far into the year, say from six to
nine months. The tremendous activity in iron and
steel was the great feature of the year.
Columns would be required to enumerate the in
crease in business in the different lines, hence only the
important ones are mentioned. The only cloud dur
ing the whole year was- the, reckless formation-^f,

THE NEW YEAR.
WHETHER we count it the last" year of a fad
ing century or the first of a new. one, igoo will
still have a particular, significance to the world.
It has been marked at its beginning by the most sol
emn services of the church, is' to be commemorated
in the most splendid capital of the world by an expo
sition of unsurpassed magnificence and beauty, and
promises to be for the world at large, despite the por
tentous war in South Africa, a period of unexampled
prosperity. ' â
Carlyle has told us:. "There are ten thousand times
ten thousand clocks in the world to sound with
clangor the alarm as the day passes on from hour to
hour, but there is no sound heard from the great horo
logue of eternity to warn the soul as the ages svveep
on from eon to eon." Man of his own volition must
stop and count and make note, if he would mark the
procession of centuries and measure how far he has
mounted upward to higher levels of life in the course
of any one of them.
0 That meditation will to-day, to some extent at least,
occupy every reflecting mind throughout the Chris
tian world. Men will compare and contrast so far as
they can the condition of mankind with what it was
in iSoo. The tremendous advance which has be^n
made in every form of material good, will occur to
all. The vast increase in man's power over the forces
of nature will engage serious attention; nor will any
one overlook the thousand evidences of a moral im
provement in the general. mass of men attending the
improvement in their physical comforts and in all the
complex materialities of their environment.
The proofs of ennoblement resulting from the work
and the thought of the century will be noted with
gratification. They are to be found everywhere,
even in the war in South Africa. Battles are no
longer so bloody as they were, the contending forces
are gentler toward the prisoners who fall into their
power, and a thousand tender ministrations of skillful
hands and kind hearts await to relieve the pain of
the wounded and as far as possible nurse them back
to health.
From the great advance which has been made since
the beginning of the century, it is certainly reasonable
to draw auguries of a still greater advance in the cen
tury to come. Science and mechanical ingenuity have
accomplished marvels in drawing men . into closer
communication and relationship to one another, and
with that has come a diminution of racial enmities.
The industrial forces that, make for peace increase
with the years, and the enlightened body of men and
women who oppose wars grows in numbers and m
prestige. It is still a military world. The nations
were never before so universally armed, nor did they
ever watch one another with more of jealousy. Never
theless it was never before so peaceful a world, nor
did the nations ever before have so many alliances
that tend to the maintenance of peace.
Considered from every point of view, therefore, the
century has given good reason' for the highest hopes
of humanity. In all the tides of time never was there
such progress made in any other century, and never
did a New Year's day dawn that brought to the world
so bright a prospect and so strong a promise of com
ing good.
We sleep and wake and sleep, but all things move,
The sun flies onward to his brother sun;
The dark earth follows wheeled in her eclipse.
And human things, returning on themselves.
Move onward, leading up the golden year.
THE NEW COMMISSIONS
OF the Mayor's selections of Commissioners to
administer the various branches of the munici
pal government under the new charter, it may
be said as was said of the ten virgins in the parable,
some are wise and some are foolish. It is to be re
gretted that the Mayor has shown the worst judgment
in the very appointments where he should have exer
cised his best.
Taking the list in the order given out and published
yesterday, and reviewing it as a whole, the first com
mission, that of the Board of Public Works, will meet
with general approval. It is excellent in every re
spect. Following it is the Civil Service Commission,
which has been very inadequately filled. The ap
pointees are not strong men and as a body the com
mission is likely to fall below the level of the respon
sibilities imposed upon it. The 'appointees to the
Board of Education are also unsatisfactory. The Po
lice Commission is fairly well made up. On the Fire
Commission two good men have been named and
they may perhaps control the board and make it an
efficient body. The Election Commission will pass
as good. The Park Commission is excellent and the
same commendation can be given to the Board of
Health. " VÂ° : v ",
It will be seen that the two commissions to which
the weakest appointments have been made are the
Civil Service and the Board of Education. Now it is
upon these two commissions that the most important
reforms and administrative work under the new char
ter are to be carried out. The foundation of the whole
new charter system of government rests upon the
regulation of the civil service. That commission will
have to resist and to overcome all the push and the
pull of the job chasers and the .bosses; it will have ro
put aside even* temptation toward partiality or favor
itisrrr, no matter upon what consideration they b~
urged. Bad men or weak; men who are intense, par
tisans or who are inclined to use official power for
their own advantage can readily find means to evade
the civil service regulations and' advance unworthy
favorites to office. The Call does not charge that the
Commissioners appointed by the Mayor will misuse
their authority and turn their office into a patronage
bureau, but it does say the importance of the civil ser
vice to the municipality under the new charter is so
great that the men chosen to administer it should
have been among the strongest and most eminent in
the city. The public will not have full confidence in
the Commissioners until they win it by the merit of
their service and it is to be hoped that merit will be
shown.
The Board of Education has charge of a work
whose importance it would be difficult to overesti
mate. It will have to undertake something like a rad
ical reform of the schools, for it is well known that
for years past every successive School Board has fur
nished the city with scandalous jobs or frauds of some
kind. The variety, the extent and the degree of evils
caused to public education by corrupt or inefficient
school boards have long been the subject of indignant
comment and formed the theme of the main discus
sion at the recent con% r ention of the Teachers' Asso
ciation. It is therefore with deep concern the public
will note the weakness of the Mayor's appointments
to that board.
Protest apairst the appointments is of course un
availing. The people, however, will note the weak
places in the administration that is to direct municipal
affairs in the inauguration of the new charter, and will
be prompt to note any sign of inefficiency or evidence
of bad intent. The sanguine spirit that now animates
nearly all classes of citizens will incline them to ex
pect the best results, but it will not blind them to
faults or frauds; and while honor will be given where
hooor is due, there will be swift and sharp condem
nation of any official or any commission that betrays
the popular confidence that with the new charter and
the new era, there are to be, along with prosperity
and improvement, a marked degree of efficiency, hon
esty and civic patriotism in every department of the
municipal administration.
YELLOW GOLD
AND NEWS OF
ITS DIGGERS
The Year's Yieid, the Mining Bu
reau, Golden Mud" and
Location Problems.
It Is too early for more than approxlm
ate estimates of the State's mineral prod
uct for ISW. and the best of these ma:
prove very, erroneous when reliable sta
tlstics have been compiled three months
or so hence by tho Mint- and Mining Bu
reau.
The. gold product Is not likely to vary
more than $500,000 from that of IS9B, and
may be nearly the same. Selbys, who re
ceive at first bond and refine two-thirds
or more of the gold product, expect little
change. The Director of the Mint has
just proclaimed a preliminary estimate
crediting California with $14,952,332, as
compared with $15,637,900 last year. His
figures are doubtless too low, as they gen
erally are. Good authorities. In close
touch with the Industry, expect, an in
crease of nearly a half million.
Under normal conditions there would
have been an increase reaching into the
millions. The enlargements in the scale
of operations of many of the biggest pro
ducing mines, the bringing into produc
tion of many new and rehabilitated prop
erties and the enormous increase of ac
tivity in every department of the mining
Held make this certain.
Of course, it was the drought that les
sened the golden stream. In 18'JS it was
estimated that the lack of water that
year cut short the gold product by $4,000,
uOO. In 1899 the industry suffered an un
precedented second year of drought, and
as the stored waters were everywhere al
ready abnormally low, the effect was
more severe than in the year before. Late
in the season production was nearly sus
pended along the mother lode. Many of
the heaviest producers again ran on half
time or hung up all their stamps for
weeks. Late in September there was
hardly a mill running In Tuolumne Coun
ty; in hydraulic mines, monitors were
silent; drift miners could not wash their
gravel. The shortage thus occasioned
again reached millions.
But the mining industry looks up now
with the remainder of the State as buoy
ant and as certain of a great future as
and other Industry. The liberal rains
have supplied already all lack of water
and there will be an abundance during the
coming year; which will send the product
to figures not reached before in a genera
tion, 'Â¦'Â¦m -
Copper, petroleum, quicksilver, borax,
silver, asphalt and other products will
show gains and a grÂ«U increase of de
velopment and prospects for the near fu
ture. There will likely be an increase of a
million barrels of petroleum and copper
will show a great advance. The quick
silver boom has only fairly begun.

X OtJUROMT:, Drc. 21.â 1t Is asserted that the PopÂ© after the recent ceremony of
opening the holy door at St. Peter's Cathedral addressed his intimate ln
tourage and eaid:
"I thank Divine Providence for granting me the gTace of being able to
celebrate this great function, and I wish for my successor grandeur and a
long reign, to the gTeater glory of God. My successor will be young as
compared with my own age, and will have time to see many glories of the papacy
and the church."
Later Leo clearly designated Cardinal Girolamo Maria Gotti, prefect of the con
groiratlon of indulgences and sacred relics, as his successor.
It Is hard to tell how the candidature of Cardinal Gotti sprang Into existence.
He is a monk of the barefooted Carmelite order, and is as Ligurian as Pope
Julius 11. But he holds himself apart from the miseries of the world like Sextus
V before h<Â» throw away his crutches. He displayed diplomatic qualities of tho
highest order in the mission to Brazil confided to him by Leo XIII.
In that country, in addition to the conflict going on between the civil and re
llfrious authorities, the church was In considerable danger on account of the lack
of discipline which prevailed among the clergy and the episcopate. To the great
astonishment of every one the Pope selected the superior of the barefooted Car
mclitos, who happened to he Father Gotti, to put an end to disorder and re-es
tablish harmony between the religious and civil powers.
Father Gotti In two or three years triumphed over all difficulties and his
sucooss was so complete that on his return the holy father decreed him a
Can'.inal's hat. Greatness appears to have no temptations for Cardinal Gotti, for,
though clothed in purple, he occupies a very modest room at the Forum of Tra
jan and sleeps on a monk's bed. His political tendencies are unknown and he
may be either a conciliatory Pope or a fighting Pope, according to his personal
Inclination and to the character of the majority which places him In St. Peter's
chair.
NEW SHIPS BUILT
DURING THE YEAR
Total Tonnage More
Than in 1898.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 31.â The total
number of vessels built and officially
numbered by the Bureau of Navigation
during the calendar year Just ended was
954, aggregating 267,642 gross tons, com
pared with "955, aggregating 237,600 gross
tons, for the year 189 S. Steam vessels
built during 1899 numbered 421. of 160,132
gross tons, compared with 550 of 169,602
gross tons for IS9B. Sail vessels numbered
533 of 107,510 gross tons, compared with
405 of 67,998 gross tons for 1898. The In
crease Is almost wholly on the Atlantic
and Gulf coasts, where 658 vessels of 163,
519 gross tons were built, compared With
538 vessels of 86,005 gross tons for 1898. On
the Paclnc Coast only 114 vessels of 20,5(/7
gross tons were built, compared with 240
of 61,923 gross tons for the previous year.
This failing off In construction on the
Pacific Coast, In spite of the fact that the
Alaskan trade next year will be very large,
Is due partly to the belief that American
merchant vessels hitherto employed as
transports to Manila will be released and
enter the coasting trade in the spring.
Construction on the lakes comprised 70
vessels of 72,094 gross tons, compared with
66 of 75,067 gross tons for 1898; on the Mis
sissippi and Western rivers 112 of 11,942
gross tons, compared with 111 of 14,605
gross tons for IS9S. he total output for
the United Kingdom for the year has not
been ascertained, but it will exceed 744
steamships of 1,363,319 gross tons, all of
which were steel, built during 1898. The
returns for the first six months of the fis
cal year show the construction in the
United States of 627 vessels of 133,487 gross
tons, compared with 511 vessels of 130,154
gross tons for the corresponding six
months of the previous fiscal year. None
of the foregoing figures Include unrigged
barges and canal boats. Including these
the total documented tonnage built in the
United States during the current fiscal
year bids fair to be somewhat over 300,000
gross tons.

IX. OTHELLLO.
Introductory Study.
The tragedy of "Othello" is everywhere
acknowledged to be one of the greatest
triumphs of human genius. In both con
ception and execution it stands unsur
passed In the literature of ancient or mod
ern times. It fulfills all the conditions
of high tragedy. Here if anywhere in art
we stand face to face with the solemn
mystery of evil, the possibilities of human
wickedness, the heights of human devo
tion. In lago on the one hand and in the
Moor and his gentle lady on the other
tho extremes of human character meet In
mortal conflict, and there is no hand to
save. The evil prevails so far as evil can
ever prevail. We pity and tremble and
are chastened. |
Can anything new be said about this
stupendous work? For 100 years now
learned critics and lovers of Shakespeare,
from Schlegel and Coleridge to George
Brandes and Sidney Lee, have given us
the results of their studies upon the sub
ject in all its phases. As we turn from
the survey of the mass of writings' that
have gathered about the play we are apt
to feel as though there were nothing
more, either wise or foolish, left to be
said. The better we know the piece the
more we are likely to feel with Dr. John
son that "the beauties of this play im
press themselves so strongly upon the
attention of the reader that they can
draw no aid from critical Illustration";
and perhaps the most helpful advice one
THE RIALTO, VENICE.
can give Is, to read, and to reread, and to
read again. For one to attempt to sum
marize, abridge or interpret piecemeal for
another, seems almost an impertinence.
In plot structure "Othello" shares with
"Coriolanus" the distinction of being the
moat symmetrical and evenly sustained of
the author's works. The explanation of
this in the case In hand may be seen in
the nature of the theme and in the form
of the original story. In Cinthlo's tale
the plot is simple and the characters are
few. Only one of bis persons bears a
name ("Dlsdemona," the ill-starred).
Shakespeare selects names for the others,
and in place of the wife's "relatives"
puts Brabantio. To this small group he
adds the dupe Roderigo, a creature of
his own lnventfon; and to what Important
use he puts him in bringing out the real
nature of lago is speedily apparent. In
their first words together we early discov
er the "eternal villain." "the busy and In
sinuating rogue." as he acts out his das
tardly plans. Not less clearly appears the
noble, unsuspecting, free and open nature
of hl3 victim, the Moor. The lines of at
tack are worked out with precision, and
the nature of the struggle is plainly fore
shadowed. In spite of all hl3 efforts to
escape the hero is gradually but securely
entolled. and the plot PÂ«> ceed Â» w 'â¢
steady and relentless movement to the
tragic close. The climax or height of
entanglement is reached in the third act,
and the curtain quickly falls upon the

te i r n al character development this play Is
m^hlracter, but merely to the rousing of
Lesions already dormant in his breast.
The unfolding of character, however,
seen "n all the principal persons of the
nlot has nowhere been surpassed.
As a Itage Play "Othello" has always
betn a favorite with the public and with
thl profession. All the great actors of
modern times, from Burbage to the elder
Salvini, have appeared In It. Â»e\eral of
them with world-renowned success Of
tho last it was common to say that he did
not play Othello; that he was Othello. A
like Judgment was passed upon Edmund
Kean by his contemporaries.
In studying any work of Shakespeare's
we do well to remember that he wrote for
a London audience and that he was thor
oughly English. Especially do we need
toteep this in mind when confronted with
the mass of antiquarian and other matter
that has been .literally piled upon his
plays in recent years, much of whicn
serves to darken rather than to elucidate
their meaning. We are not to suppose,
for example that in writing Hamlet
he cared much for Danish customs as
such; or in writing "Coriolanus for the
life of prehistoric Rome. *or romantic
purposes his scenes were generally laid
In remote places or distant times, or both,
and he preserves in varying degree the lo
cal coloring of his sources. This, however,
is often little more than a matter of
names. In his Italian and Scotch scenes
he has preserved more fully than else
where the local atmosphere, and from this
it has been claimed that he must have
visited those countries in person. How
ever that may be. as he wrote for an Eng
lish audience and in the English tongue
he naturally made his characters men and
women not too foreign to English blood.
Accordingly Theseus becomes an English
nobleman. Hamlet an English prince,
Desdemona an English wife. Even his
supernatural characters are English. En
glish fairies dwell in Athenian groves
and English witches on the blasted heath
of Scotland.
Does this rule hold for Othello? Not a
few critics, following the lead of A. W.
Schlegel, have maintained that Othello
can only be understood in the light of his
racial peculiarities. "We recognize in
Othello," says Schlegel. "the wild nature
of that glowing zone which generates the
most raging beasts of prey and the mo3t
deadly polaons, tamed only in appearance
by the desire of fame, by foreign laws of
honor and by nobler and milder manners.
His jealousy is not the Jealousy of the
heart, which is compatible with the tcn
derest feeling and adoration of the be
loved object; it is of that sensual kind,"
etc. No doubt difference in blood appears
to serve a purpose in bringing on the
catastrophe of the play, as in the original
tale; but is this difference essential or ac
cidental with Shakespeare? Commentators
who seek to rationalize the poet's methods
and to find a cause for every effect will,
of course, make this difference the main
spring of the tragedy. But is this the
real truth of the matter? May not the
mad Jealousy of Othello be met with un
der every sun? Did Shakespeare's audi
ence need to go to Italy for examples of
innocence misled, betrayed, destroyed?
Was the noble, credulous, passionate man
a stranger to their observation? Othello's
African blood is a mere accident and must
not blind us to the real significance of this
marvelous presentation of a universal
fact, as mysterious as it is universal, the
presence in the world of malignant and
deadly forces in human shape, and the
consequent danger that threatens, we may
almost. say is inherent In, the possession
of the noblest virtues.
Does the wickedness of lago pass belief?
.We should be glad to think so; and yet
our desire to think so may blind us to thÂ«
real truth about wicked men, as the sim
plicity of Desdemona and Othello closed
their eyes to the r*>al naturo of their ad
versary. That cold, calculating, serpent
like Intellectuality, which consider* truth
fulness folly and virtue a fig. is still pres
ent in the world Jr. which we live. St.
Paul found It in his day: Shakespeare na<l
evidently encountered It: the scriptu.*
paradox. "Be ye wise as serpents and
harmless as doves." points to Its exist
ence. Vet. bad as lago is, true to human
nature even In Its most villainous forjn.
he goes seeking for motives to Justify hii
diabolical schemes. "The Moor hail passed
him by unjustly.'". ln this connection Coi*'
ridge'a well-worn phrase, "the motive
hunting of a motiveless malignity," muit
do duty orfco more.
Was Othello a blackamoor? WÂ« have
no means of knowing how Burbage pre
sentPd the character; but from thÂ»Â» elegy
written upon him â¢n the time of hl.-Â»
death we may infer that this was his
'Hut l?t me not forget one chiefeÂ»t Dart
Wherein, beyond the rÂ»Â»st. he moved thÂ» heart.
The grieved Moor, rmirlf Jealous by a slave.
Who sent his wife to fill a timeless xravp.
Then slew himself upÂ«n the bloody NÂ»<l.'
The language of the piiy seems to make
Othello black, not tawny. One passage
especially leaves room for little doubt on
this point:
"Her namÂ», that was n* fresh
An Plan's visage. Is now bÂ»>j;rlm'>i and black
As mine own face." (111., 3, tS*-ISJL)
Throughout thfÂ» eighteenth century. from-
Beterton to KembU\ he was uniformly so
represented upon the English stage and
generally in the scarlet uniform of a Brit
ish officer. Garrlck so played the part.
The elder Kean (ISU) was the first to
break the tradition
In this case, as in
the case of Shylock.
and acted the part
as a tawny iloor.
His example has
been generally fol
lowed from that day
to this.
The question of
color divides itself
into two partsâ
what was Shake
peare's Intention?
and what is most
effective on tho
modern stage? On
the second point we
may safely assume
that the lighter col
or is the only one
acceptable to tho
audience of to-day.
Did Shakespeare
himself consider the
matter important? In Clnthlo'a tale the
wicked ensign urges the blackness (ne
iÂ» zzaj of the Aioor as a reason for Des
demona's alleged aversion to her hus
band. Did the poet take this literally and
think it not worth while to modify It, or
did he deliberately choose to startle us
by another of those daring contrasts
which approach the very limits of proba
bility, such as the wooing of Anne la
"Kichard III," or the opening scene
of "Lear," or Hamlet's cruelty to
Ophelia? Christopher North held to
the latter opinion, and argued it with
no little persuasiveness, "mack Is tho
utter antithesis." "Pity for the contrast
and the thought of the immense love that
has overcome it." "Every Jot of soot you
take from his complexion you take an
iota from the stgnitied power of love."
Such are his words; but he tempers them
with the reflection that "on the stage
some consciousness that everything is not
as literally meant as It seemsâ that sym
bols of humanity, and not actual men
and women, are before youâ saves the
piay." Wllson"s view (lsso> had been
anticipated by Charles Lamb (lSllj In his
delightfully semi-quizzical essay "On the
Tragedies of Shakespeare." The love of
Desaemona for Othello is there cited as
an illustration of "the perfect triumph of
virtue over accidents, of the imagination
over the senses." But while he justilles
this In a reading play, he objects to Its
visual presentation upon the stage.
Was Othello jealous? Coleridge argued,
with his usual subtlety, that he was not.
The answer to the question depends upon
our definition of the term. Othello Is cer
tainly not such a Jealous man as was
Leontes. We commonly associate with
the word the element of morbid distrust.
Othello was clearly not jealous In this
baser sense. He Is wholly unsuspecting
at first. lago's insinuations surprise and
trighten him.
"Therefore these stops of thine fright me tlÂ»Â«
more."
He does not welcome distrust; he fights
against it. Yet his suspicions are finally
aroused and confirmed by the satanlc In
genuity of lago and the co-operation of
late, and his great heart is fired and torn
by trie pains of jealousy. Thl3 he himself
realized when it was too late; and per
haps the best answer to our question,
after al'., la that given in his own wordsâ
"One not easily Jealous, but, being wrought.
Perplexed la the extreme."
True, a few moments before, when con
fronted with his deed, he exclaimed:
"For nought did I In hate, but all In honor";
yet, when the full sense of his rashness
comes over him, he falls Into setf
reproaches of the bitterest tone:
"When we shall meet, at compt.
This look of thine will hurl my soul from
heaven,
And fiends will snatch at It*;
and a little later;
Â¦"O fool! fool: fool!"
But these reproaches are not Shakes
peare's, nor shall they be ours. We pre
ter Cassio'js final word.
For he was great of heart."
Indeed, we miss the true import of tho
play entirely If we do not see and dwell
upon the wrong done to Othello rather
thar* the wrong done by him. The ap
palling calamity that falls upon him is the
central theme of the whole. The fate of,
Desdcmona, pitiful as it is â and it could
not be more so â is secondary to the other.
Ccleridge has rightly urged that we must
perseveringly put ourselves In Othello's
place and remember his entire confidence
in lago's honesty, a confidence we find it
difficult to comprehend from the point of
view of a mere spectator. Unless Othello
wins our deepest sympathy for his un
happy and unmerited fate the tragedy
falls for us. Such compassion can arise
only from a sense of kinship with his no
bility of nature.
The theater-goer of ancient Athens sat
at the foot of the Acropolis, with thÂ© blue
vault of heaven above him and all the
glories of mountain and sea around him

CHINESE JUNK
Illicit Shrimp Fishers
Resist Arrest.
THREATEN THE CONSTABLE
DISPLAY OF WEAPONS BRINGS
THEM 'TO TIME.
Twenty Members of the King Ow
Yong Company Arrested and
Their Junks Held as
Evidence. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 31.â A hand-to
hand fight in a plunging, rolling Junk be
tween desperate shrimp fishers and San
Rafael officers took "place to-day. The
men were caught red-handed with the
holds of their craft filled up with small
fish and shrimps caught with the aid of
the forbidden "set net."
Late last night Constable George Agnew
received word from Point San Pedro that
the fishermen of King Ow Yong's combine
were using the proscribed nets and also
mingling a plentiful sprinkling o' "small
fry" along with their lawful prey of
shrimps. At dawn this morning Agnew,
accompanied by Deputy Fish Commis
sioner Alfonso Miller and several depu
ties, left for the scene. On their arrival
they found the junks were out at sea,
and surmising that the fishermen were at
their work the officials embarked In a
swift sloop to effect their capture. All
the junks but one yielded quietly to the
representatives of the law and took their
way shoreward to await a launch to tow
thorn back to San Rafael. The exception
ran up her sail and stood out across the
bay toward San Pablo. Taking In the sit
uation the oflicers gave chase and for
about half an hour the two craft tore
through the water with their lee rails
submerged. The boat occupied by the of
ficers, however, soon shortened the dis
tance between pursuer and pursued. A
heavy sea was running at the time and to
board the Orientals' craft was a task
of the utmost difficulty. After some
trouble Agnew managed to spring aboard
and was instantly surrounded by Chinese
with their arms raised In a threatening
manner and armed with boat hooks. In
the meantime the craft which Miller and
the deputies occupied had been compelled
to sheer off, as the heavy sea made the
two craft roll against each other and the
clumsy junk with her ponderous steering
sweep threatened to smash the smaller
boat to pieces. Agnew drew a pistol on
his assailants, but even with this auxil
iary it is doubtful if he would have been
able to keep them off had not Miller seen
his plight and sent three bullets crashing
in uncomfortable proximity to the Ori
entals' heads.
This brought them to time and no fur
ther difficulty was experienced with them.
The arrested men, twenty in all, belong
to the King Ow Yong Company and are
among those who have been most per
sistent in the persecution of the Yung Wo
fishermen, who, by refusing to Join the
Yong combine, brought the hatred of the
wholo fishing community on their heads.
Nets, fish and Junks will be brought to
San Rafael to be usod as evidence against
the prisoners. The various factions of tho
camp at Point San Pedro have for a long
time been at outs and the frequent ar
rests which have occurred of late will
add fuel to the fire and a general war
of the tongs Is feared to be imminent.

The great historic panorama of the Bat

exhibition at Central Park for several
months, is soon to be removed for ship

ASSERTS THAT DEWEY
KEPT OUT OF RANGE
Montejo Attributes His Defeat at
Manila to the Weakness of
His Guns.
CHICAGO. Dec. 31.â The Tribune to-day
prints the text of Admiral Montejo's de
fense under court-martial proceedings for
his defeat at Manila. The bulk of the
blame is charged by the admiral, not to
himself or his fleet, but to the Spanish
Government for unprepared conditions.
He claims that Admiral Dewey kept out
of range of Spanish gunsâ a proceeding
which Montejo refers to as a "retreat.
Admiral Montejo says:
* The only preparation that had been made for
war was made by the Americans. The initial
velocity of our cannon was 510 metres; that
of the smallest cannon of our enemy was 7DO
metres. Admiral Dewey, with pencil In hand,
noted the thickness of his mantles and his
casements and knew wbat energy was required
to penetrate them. He also knew exactly the
weight of the most powerful projectile of our
ships and by a simple mathematical calcula
tion he arrived at the distance at which he
could fight without himself receiving any harm,
lie says he ascertained that he could fight at
a distance of 2000 or 3000 metres wjth absolute
Impunity. The situation, therefore, was Just
thi?: We were vulnerable to all the projectiles
of the enemy, and this the enemy well knew,
while he isot out of reach of our cannon and
remained tut of range all the while.
In order to give an idea of our miserable
situation I may mention that we had only four
teen torpedoon for the defense of 2000 metres of
space, and that the cable which we obtained
In Hongkong was only long enough for five tor
pedos, and therefore only five torpedoes could
be "laced.

ALDRICH TO CALL UP
THE FINANCIAL BILL
Arguments in the Quay Case Will Oc
cupy Much of the Time in
the Senate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31.â With the re
sumption of Its sittings Wednesday the
Senate will practically begin the roal
work of the session. Senator Aldrlch has
given notice that he will call the financial
measure up on Thursday, and It Is gener
ally believed he will then or on the fol
lowing day make a statement In support
of It.
It is the purpose of the supporters of
the bill to make very few speeches, leav
ing the opposition to do the greater share
of the talking, while Its opponents, on the
other hand, will use every endeavor to
draw the friends of the bill into running
debate.
At present there is but one matter which
threatens to Interfere with the continuity
of the proceedings on the financial bill.
That Is the right of Senator Quay to a
seat in the Senate. Senator Chandler,
chairman of the Committee on Privileges
and Elections, has stated that a report
will be made In the Quay case soon after
the beginning of business. It now seems
probable that there will be more debate
over the Quay contest than over the fin
ancial measure. Up to date not more
than a half-dozen Senators have an
nounced a purpose to make set financial
speeches, while the probabilities are that
the Quay case will call out much animated
discussion.
It will be difficult to hold the discussion
of foreign questions, especially the Phil
ippine subject, in check during the finan
cial discussion. Many Southern Senators
are anxious to bring the Philippine ques
tion to the front, and it may be safely
predicted that there will be more or less
reference to it from the beginning, as
there will be an early effort to get up
the Samoan treaty, and it may furnish a
basis for discussion on the foreign policy
if one is not found before the treaty is
considered.
The week in the House does not give
promise of much business. -:.-.*

his death by disease the irony of fate is

of a runaway accident. Later amputa

operation was performed, with a similar
result. As a last resort a few months ago
the entire leg was removed, the patient
recovering epeedily and regaining his old
time strength and vigor, only to be cut
down by disease just when a new lease
of life seemed vouchsafed. He was 63
years of age and a resident of Ventura

BURNS WORKING

Treaty Proposition Re
garded as a Blind.'
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAN DIEGO. Dec. 31.â Chairman Sam
uel P. Smith of the Republican County
Committee says there will be no call for
the committee to get together until the
friends of .Mr. Grant, as candidate for
Senator, request It.
"The fact 1?," he said, "that since Mr.
Grant became a candidate for Senator
this committee has taken no action In po
litical matters, save in the furtherance
of his candidacy. Mr. Grant has not
withdrawn from the race and that will
still be the governing principle of the ac
tion of the committee. There has been
no intimation from the growers of citrus
fruits or othrrs that they would have a
special session called. To my mind, that
in ample proof of the assertion that
Burns is behind this agitation of the cit
rus fruit men. His workers knew that
it would be useless to ask us to help the
Burns light and therefore they have now
thought to deceive us by asking us to
take action on the Jamaica treaty propo
sition."
When Senator N'utt was approached on
the extra session subject he declared that
his position could hardly be more plainly
stated by himsHf than if it had been by
Assemblyman Works, who was denning
his own feelings In the matter.
"If Governor (Jage calls a special ses
sion," he said, "I shall attend, but I will
not be one to tie myself to an agreement
to adjourn at the Governor's behest.
Neither will I be one to go Into a caucus
unless it is understood that the result of
its deliberations shall not bind me and if,
as some seem to believe, there are many
on what Is Known as the Miller petition
who have fftjnpd with the intention of
not having their names counted until the
other eighth-lour Republicans are on the
list. It will be a long time before they are
counted. My vote will still be cast for
Mr. Grant until ho has withdrawn from
the race. That, I understand, will not
be until Mr. Burns is also out of the
field."
Assemblyman Crowder is at present In
Spokane, Wash., and his view* could not
be had, but it is understood that they are
of the same color as those or the other
legislators from here.
FEAR GROWTH OF
AMERICAN TRADE
French Economists Grow
Apprehensive.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 31.â A stiff campaign
apainst the Franco-American commercial
treaty is about to be opened by the Par
liamentary opposition to the Government
and by the agriculturists. Despite the
favorable report of the citizens' commit
tee a hostile current has become manifest
among the Deputies who represent the
agricultural constituencies, as well as
those who sit for certain industrial cen
ters, against several clauses of the
treaty. A majority of the agricultural or
ganizations have protested against grant
ing the United States the minimum tariff
mÂ»U? manufacturers of farming Imple
ment , s> and machine wools are
deeply disturbed over the advantages ac
corded to their American competitors by
1n c tr ?^ t: Â£ Tnis anxiety is shared by the
oilseed industry.
The outcome of this feeling Is a motion
to be submitted to the Chamber of Depu
ties by members specially interested for
the postponement of ratification until *he
alleged objectionable clauses have been
eliminated or modified. M. Emile Cheval
lier, Deputy for Beauvais. one of the sup
porters of the motion, said in the course of
an interview to-day that by consenting to
a reduction of the duties on vegetable
oils the advocates of the treaty were se
riously' Injuring the whole body of agri
culturists, particularly those in Picardy
and Normandy, where colza is an import
ant product. The Deputy declared that a
reduction of protective duties by 75 pr
cent meant a hard blow to thousands of
1Â« rench farmers. M. Destournelles, one of
whose hobbies it Is to point out the Amer
can "peril," said:

attention to the various needs of the so
ciety. .These reports give 2549 as the
number of cases relieved during the year,
in which number is to be found represent
atives of nearly. every country under the
sun. The causes of : distress were, aa a
general thing, old age. want of employ
ment. slcknesÃ and insufficient earnings.
There were twenty-three cases that

society has a house of its own from which
to dispense its charities.

GRIGGS' RULING
LARGELY HELPS
COAST JOBBERS
Making Differentials
Not Illegal.
PRECEDENT IS ESTABLISHED
?
LOCAL BUSINESS MEN/ HIGHLY
GRATIFIED.
Decision Will Have an Important
Bearing on the Suit of the Mid
dle West Before Interstate
Commission..
The Jobbers and manufacturers of the
Pacific Coast have indirectly won a great
point in their controversy with the St.
Louis and other Middle West jobbers by
the decision of Attorney General Griggs
that railways may classify rates without
any violation of the anti-trust law.
Yesterday the jobbers of this city were
found to be very much pleased at the out
come of recent . proceedings at the na
tional capital. The point submitted to the
Attorney General of the United States
has a direct bearing on the question of
differentials. The history of the matter
was learned yesterday from W. K.
Wheeler, who has been a close student of
the entire rate question for years.
Mr. Wheeler taid that the jobbers on
the Pacific Coast had reason to be pleased
as the decision of the Attorney General
had weakened the case that tne Middle
West jobbers have been preparing as a
means ot taking the Paciric Coast terri
tory away from the business men of the
coast, toome time ago notice was given,
that the railroads using the oiricial
classification whicri was in eftect east of
the Mississippi Klver would to-day put
Into eitect a new classification. The eftect
of the change would be to widen the dif
ferentials between the carload and the
less than carload in the territory affected.
Another effect would be to make a pre
cedent in favor of the contention of the
manufacturers and Jobbers of this coast.
The carload rates had not been touched
by the Eastern official classification com
mittee, except in one or two instances,
but the less than carload rates have been
increased by the reclassiflcatlon from 50
to 114 per cent. The differentials were
therefore much greater than those exist
ing in favor of the Pacific Coast jobber, of
which the Middle West jobbers com
plained in the action against the trans
continental railroads now pending.
. The Middle West jobbers had pointed to
the official classification in defense of
their position. The railroads upon whose
action they had largely relied had justi
fied the idea upheld by the jobbers of the
Pacific Coast in reference to the differen
tial, namely, that transportation is like a
commodity, in that larger lots are sold at
less rates than are smaller ones. The
manner in which the matter came before
the Attorney General of the United
States was as follows:
The Ohio people, who were affected,
threatened to bring an injunction to pre
vent putting into effect the new classifica
tion to-day, and asked the Interstate
Commerce Commission to submit the
question to Attorney General Grigga
whether the changes proposed were in the
nature of violation of the anti-trust law.
While there had not been ostensibly a
raise in rates, the changes In the classi
fication, by moving up the less than car
load rates from one to two notches had
really raised the less than carload lots an
average of about 73 per cent. The differ
ential in favor of the Pacific Const of
which the Middle 'West jobbers had com
plained was lrps than 50 per cent. The
decision will have an important bearing
when the hparing before the Interstate
Commerce Commissioners brought on by
the St. Louis-. jobbers is resumed in this
city. Attorney General Griggs advised
that "if there be- a remedy for the com
plaining shippers' it lies In an appeal to
your (interstate) commission under the
interstate commerce law."
Charged With Robbery.
Larry Powers, a laborer, and John
Flinn, a sailor, were arrested at an early

DWIGHT MOODY
Memorial Services for
the Evangelist.
ASSOCIATION HALL CROWDED
LOVING TRIBUTES TO THE
DEAD PREACHER.
His Sterling Worth and Prodigious
Work in the Cause of Christian
ity Attested by Several
Eulogies.
Impressive memorial services to com
memorate the death of Dwight LÂ»." Moody
were held yesterday afternoon under the
auspices of the Young Men's Christian
Association in the Auditorium on Mason
street. A laree audience was present to
testify its reverence for the dead evangel
ist and his prodigious work in the cause
of Christianity was attested by eulogies
pronounced by prominent divines, some of
whom were personally acquainted with
him in life.
Henry J. McCoy, secretary of the asso
ciation, presided at the services. The
opening hymn, "Coronation," which was
sung by the congregation, was followed
by the "Rock of Ages," sung by the
Knickerbocker Quartet, after which
prayer was said by Rev. H. H. Bell, D. D.
The quartet sang the response, "The
Lord's Prayer," and Mr. McCoy then gave
a lew personal reminiscences of the de
ceased. The speaker spoke of the asso
ciation's debt of $84,000, which some ye;Â£rs
ago had been lifted entirely through the
efforts of ,ur. Moody.
Rev. K. K. Dille, I). D., then delivered
a beautiful eulogy of the evangelist.
"God raises special men for special pur
poses." saJd he, "and he raised Moody
at a critical Juncture after the Civil War
to counteract the resulting demoraliza
tion by a revival of religion. Moody's
power to convert lost souls was marvel
ous, and his judgment and sympathy were
wonderfully well balanced. He was
strong in hard common sense, and in sim
plicity sublime. He was a safe counsel
or and leader, and in his great cam
paigns on two continents he mustered his
forces with all the genius of a Grant. The
monuments of his life's work are the
great school at Northfield, where 3,000 stu
dents have been educated; the Chicago
Avenue Church,- with a membership of
2,000, and the Bible Institute in Chicago.
He took his stand on the impregnable
rock of the Holy Bible, and burned out
his great life upon the altar of God."
The quartet sang "Crossing the Bar,"
and A. B. Forbes, chairman of the Board
of Trustees of the San Francisco Young
Men's Christian Association, referred to
Moody's sterling work and characterized
him as a general who never lost a light.
A tenor solo, "He Knows, My Jesus
Knows," was sung by Charles M. Elliott
v.nd Rev. George C Adams paid the final
tribute to Mr. Moody, whom, he said,
was a peculiar product of Christian civil
ization.
"Moody was what he was'," said Dr.
Adame. "because the Bible got hold of
him and he used it magnificently in tlie
good mission of saving lost souls. The
proper study of the good book brought
out the best and richest in him. and
though not an ordained minister, he was
specially called by God to do a mighty
work in this generation. He has shown
that the Bible has not lost its power, and
never will, so long as God will raise up
Moodys to interpret its wonderful
The quartet sang "Good Night, I Am
Going Home." and the "Sweet Bye and
Bye was sung by the congregation. Ben
ediction concluded the services.

"It le ai! off with Cheong." remarked

Dead Whale Taken for a Derelict â A
Big Fleet of Deep-Water Ships
Reported Outside â Trouble
on the Gaelic.
The overdue fleet kept the pilots busy
yetterday. Early in the day about a
dozen deep water vessels showed up on
the horizon, and half that number made
port before sundown. The remainder
Jlnding the weather unfavorable stood off
shore and will probably set in to-day. In
order to be ready for them the pilot boats
were kept outside and the tug Fearless
took out half & dozen pilots to iill the va
cancies caused by the incoming fleet.
Five of the arrivals are coal laden and
their advent will tend to relieve the strin
gency In the fuel market. The sixth ves
sel is nearly us welcome, as she is loaded
with nitrate. The powder company has
been anxiously looking for her during the
past week.
The banner run of the season has been
mudÂ« by the French barK Marguerite
Â«*ounos. Both she and tlie Britlsn bark
Invermay arrived from Swansea yester
day, but the Britisher was IoJ uayi mail
ing the run while the Frenchman made it
m 113, the best passage ot the year. The
other vessels that tne iiolinos nau beaten
irom bw&nsea are the Invcrlyon, now out
120; Inverlochy, i^?: t'aas of jvllllecrankle,
J-Â»6; citssarti J4S; Normanaie. vi. ..m,
Cialline, K7, and General Neumayer, ISO
days. The owners of the Cass-aru, Xor
mandie ajid .Ncumayor have reinsured
their risks on tne vessels, la per cent be
ing piUd on Â».ie Neumayer.
'J.he British ship Godiva, on which 7 per
cent was paid, also arrived. She left KiiÂ£
land wlti. tne itajore and had an experi
ence similar to that vessel. She was off
port a couple of uays ago, but owtuj to
a change or wind ha<! to stana oft shore.
On tne British ship Australian 2i) per
cent reinsurance was paid and the gamb
lers were pleased when she came sailing
into port. The vessel was *l<j4 days out
from Cardiff and it was feared that her
cargo ol coal nad taken iire. The .Lvder
liorn was one of the arrivals on which no
reinsurance was paid. <sh<Â» was HO days
making the run irom Hamburg and has
beaten the Reliance, now out 175. and the
Canrobert, 803 days. The latter vessel got
Into trouble off tne Horn, and had to put
Into Valparaiso for water.
The lit-rman ship Schwarzenbek and
German bark Birma were the other ar
rivals. The Schwarzenbek made the run
from Newcastle. Australia, in 74 days,
and the Birma came from Iquique In 08
days. Both vessels had uneventful pas
sages.
The schooner Lena Sweasy arrived from
Manzanillo yesterday with a cargo of
cedar logs, and Captain Johnson reports
that there is a tleet of at h-ast twenty
deep wan r ships off ?hore. In that event
the list of arrivals should be very large
to-day. When fifty miles west southwest
of Point Keycs the lookout on the schoon
er reported a derelict on the starboard
bow. It was petting dusk at the time and
ail hands made sure it was the remains of
a schooner bottom up. Captain Johnson
altered his course ana stood down toward
the de-relict, but before h* got within a
quarter of a mile of It the odor and the
Hock of sea fowl that arose from it told
him it WiLÂ» a dead whale. This is prob
ably the same derelict that has been
sighted by passing vessels several times
during the past week. The whale has
probably been killed by the hunters who
make their headquarters at Monterey and
getting away from them in heavy weather
ha^ been drifting around ever since.
The stevedores working on the Gaelic
got a touch of quarantine yesterday that
they did not like. The vessel had been
thoroughly fumigated at the quarantine
elation In order to kill the rats. When
she Â¦was berthed at th*Â» mall dock there
were no windfalls to carry off the fumes
of the drugs us'?d In fumigating. In con
eequence when the longshoremen got Into
the 'tween decks they were nearly suf
focated, and after regaining the wharf
half of them could not be persuaded to go
back aboard the vessel again. The steve
dores thought it was a good Joke, but
the longshoremen could not see It in that
lipht and refused to work.
ITnited States Quarantine Officer Kln
youn is determined that no bubonic plague
ehall come into San Francisco from Hono
lulu. He Is on watch night and day, and
any packet that comes from the islands
will be rigidly Inspected before she Is al
lowed to dock. In the case of vessels ar
riving from Honolulu direct, the Captain
â¢will have to show an extra clean bill of
health or his vessel will be quarantined.

HUMAN HEART

Revelation at Eliza
Reeves' Autopsy.
DEATH CAME VERY SUDDENLY
PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON
IN AN AGED WOMAN.
Her Heart Measured Fourteen Inches
in Circumference and the Walls
Were. Over an Inch in
-; '/â¢: :' Thickness. â¢Â¦ .. v- ; ;
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 90S Broadway. Dec. 31.
An autopsy held this afternoon on the
remains of Mrs. Eliza T. Reeves, who
died very suddenly at her home. 837 Jack
son street, shortly after midnight last
night, revealed an enlargement of ; the
heart that Is a physiological phenomenon.
Mrs. Reeves, who is the wife of Thomas
Reeves, the well-known gardener, had
Just passed her sixty-second year and
ncr health In the past had been what
might be called perfect. She had been
married forty years and reared four chil
dren, two of whom are married, and on
the occasion of Christmas at the family
reunion she appeared in 'Â¦ the., best '..of
health and spirits. . Â¦ : -...-..' ...- â¢"â¢ :: -C-\- '+.
At midnight she complained of a' pain
in her chest. Â¦ Dr. Andrew .Fine waa
promptly summoned, but before- the phy
sician could arrive she passed away..-Cor
oner Mehrmann was notified to-day and
an inquest will be held next Tuesday. ?
Notwithstanding the ' husband's . objec
tions, an autopsy was held this after
noon by Dr. Fine, when it was found
that death^was caused by enlargement of
the heart. This propeller of life force,
however, proved to be the largest ever
seen by Dr. Fine in his many years' ex
perience aa an autopsy physician. Though
in her prime, Mrs. Reeves had tipped the
scales at .200 pounds, she was not a large
woman; at the time of her death. Her
heart weighed about nineteen ounces,
whereas'.'tne normal heart of an. adult
weighs between eight and ten ounces.
Mrs. Reeves'' heart measured eleven and
one-half Inches in circumference and
fourteen inches in the other measure
ment.: The walls of her heart were over
an Inch in thickness. :...-:..'.. . Â¦
"The heart is the largest that I have
ever, seen, " said Dr. Fine to-night, "and
Iguess It is the largest any one has ever
seen in: a human body. It is marvelous
that. Mrs. Reeves lived as long as she did
without complaint as to tnat organ.
Aside, from the unusual size, the only de
fects 1 found were in some of the valves,
and it is probable that the valvular de
fects were the cause of the enlargement."
. Mrs.; Reeves was a native of Kngland,
aged 62 years, and had long resided in
this city; She was a member of the local
lodge of the order of Daughters of St.
George.: The funeral will take place next
Tuesday afternoon from the late resi
dence and the Interment will be in Moun
tain View Cemetery. . .- : Â¦ ..
PROMOTION MAY
BRING WITH IT
A REDUCTION
Gossip of Shatter's
Prospects.
TWO EQUAL COMMISSIONS
Â»
SAID TO BE NO PRECEDENT
FOR IT.
Raised to a Retired Major General of
Regulars, He May Have to
Resign as a Vol
unteer.
The proposed appointment" of Major
General Shafter of the volunteers as a
major general of regulars may have mon
significance than at first appears, for
there is a well-denned opinion among
army folk that the appointment can only
mean the immediate retirement of the
General in both ranks.
The plan to promote General Shafter,
at present a retired brigadier of the reg
ular army as well as a major general of
volunteers, to be a major general of regu
lars, comes from the President and the
Secretary of War. The rank will be given
by Congress by the passage of a bill
framed by the Secretary of War, but it
will carry no active duty with it. Shafter
has already passed the age limit and wad
retired as a regular officer last October,
so all Congress can do is to place him on
the retired list as a major general instead
of a b.ig;idier.
Ther*\ are those well versed in army
lore, however, who say such a thins a^
an officer holding two commissions of the
same rank,- one in the regular army and
one In the volunteers, is not according tn
military precedent. .The regulations are
silent on the matter, and if It be out of or
der at all it. Is because of some ruling of
the War Department. v :
Should it be found to be a military im
possibility- to confer the dual rank upon
General Shafter. it is probable he will re
sign his volunteer commission at once, for
to be a major general upon the rrtire<l
list for the remainder of a man's life ia
better than to be a major general of vol
unteers with at most no worse than eight
een months' service ahead.
The theory of. the position, according
to those who say the Â¦ two commissions
cannot exist. Is this: An officer may leave,
the regular army to become a voluntet-r
officer only when such transfer iÂ° a pro
motion as well. If he be not promoted his
services are considered of more use In th<Â»
regular establishment than In the volun
teers. If he be not raised in rank there
can be no reason for his transfer.
Like the Question of precedence between
Deweyand Miles, the matter of two ma

by Washington. Bnt in what way it will
be settled is a question causing considera

MAHER AND

TRAINING
Both Men Say They Are in
Good Shape for the
Mul >
;. ,-. f-reclat Dispatch 'to The Call.
NEW YORK. Dec. Sl.â For their battle
at Coney Island to-morrow afternoon
Kid McCoy and Peter Maher of Ireland
are in perfect physical condition, the re
sult of six weeks of conscientious train
ing, iioth men to-day concluded their
preparation for the battle by taking but
mild exercise. McCoy's work consisted
of a five-mile horseback ride and tossing
the medicine ball, followed by a cold
shower bath and a hard rub down. At
the conclusion of his exercise the "Kid"
said that never in his life had he felt
better prepared for a fight. Bunches of
muscle .stood out proihinently on his
arms, chest and back. Every muscle ap
peared to have been trained to the highest
point of perfection. He looked a picture
of. perfect physical manhood. There is
no doubt that McCoy's physique has
undergone wonderful improvement. So
far as strength and weight is concerned
he is a better man to-day than ever. In
former battles McCoy has been reluctant
to make a knock-out prediction for him
self, but for lus fight with Maher he
states that he will surely knock the
Irishman out inside the limit of twenty
live rounds.
McCoy has selected as his place during
the battle the southwest corner. It is the
same that tiharkey occupied in his fight
with Jeilries. Mahtr will have the north
east corner, in which Jeffries rested in
his. lights with Fii? and Sharkey. Mc-
Coy's advisers wilTbe William Muldoon,

FRAWLEY WINS "WITH
FLYING COULORS"
<rt:Â«^ tflTH FLYING COLOURS- 1 comes
' wvxiT: : w l*-^ : a - r<Â¥COr d of success at- the
\T\yf ' : Adclf)lii Theater, London, where
. Â¦ .Â¦ â¢ ' ' Jt rah .tor 'â¢Â¦'.- a twelvemonth . or
more.. It is the inpst pretentioiiu effort
the Frawliey. co'mjTany' has made, yet it
does not differ, greatly in ijuality. froni its
predecessors.' To analyze one melodrama
is to' atralyze all im-lodramns", rxctpt'r.g,
perhaps, u fc\y- thathcre.and.thorc make,
for originalityâ originality of the higher
sort I; mean, the kind that -.throws tradi
tion to the winds and bespeaks something
of the creative faculty In It* auilior.
"W ith Flying Colours" is not ' one of
these. It is built on the same old lines,
the' various impossible, popular- expres
sions of virtue and vice are all there, with
little or' no relief of n sound literary or
dramatic sort. People of intelligence do
not read stories, of this kind, mou^n thuu
sahds of them are published In paper-back
editions, and if they ure to bo made ac
ceptable on the stage it must bo by vir
tue of plcturesqutness and vitality. Thus
the setting nnrl acting are all important,
and the play Is notthe thing. .
In. point of scenery the production ut the
California is commendable. ; There are
fourteen scenes, which for the most part
are well contrived, and with but a few
forglveable concessions to expediency.
The usual contrasts prevail, ami one Is
taken" from the atmosphere of IoW life to
scenes . wherein gentlefolk pnjoy tho
amenities of wealth. All very phasing to
the. gallery anil sufficiently well carried
out to interest most people. The scene in
the wood In the second act, with its pic
nic and hunting party, is quite real in Its
tone, despite the contrast between the
English and the American members of tile
company.
The Americans are very -artificially Eng
lish and .Mr. Harrington Reynolds is very
"Englishly" artificial. It was in "The
Sporting Duchess" that he did his best
work; anu Judging him by that- standard
ho Is not up to the mark In the present
production. A more perpetually conscious
actor were, hard to Imagine or one more
absorbed In his attitude and accent, j-'rari
cis Byrne has, I think, at last found his
milieu. As a lover ho was always im
possible, thouerh I thought nt flrÂ«?i i"at his
rather j>ofr appfÂ«rnnce cUv him out for
such parts. As 'he vil'Vn trt "Wl'b
ing -Colours" he acts earnestly and effeo
tl\ely.. Miss Van Buren is given the part
of an hnglish slavey, which I woul.l have
considered out of her line had I not seen
her in It.- She does some very cleve
character work with her small opportuni
ties. The rest of the cast is by far too
numerous to mention. .

SANDBAGGED BY
TWO THUGS AND
ROBBED BY THEM
Ohling Was Attacked
Close to His
â¢ Home.
Oakland .Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 31.
. Erick O. Ohling, a ship joiner residing
at 1014 Pine street. West Oakland, was
attacked by two desperate footpads near
his home after midnight this morning and
sandbagged and relieved of his watch
and chain, besides about Sl2 in coin. Mr.
Ohling had spent the evening with friends
iii San Francisco and returned from the
metropolis on the late boat. Before he
left the other side, however, Ohling
stopped In several water front saloons to
quaff a nightcap or two. It is supposed
that during an Interval of frivolity he
flashed some gold coin, which glittered In
the eyes of two unknown thugs, who sup
posedly followed' him acress the bay to
within a few steps of his home on Pine
street. .
Ohling noticed two pedestrians behind
him, but regarded them- a? nlso belated
Oaklanders. Suddenly he was struck on
the head with a sandbag ami felled to the
sidewalk unconscious. , The footpads
promptly searchi-d him and relieved him
of his valuables; The thugs then made
good their escape, -.leaving their x'ictlm
to care for himself. After regaining con
sciousness Ohling hurried to his home
and to-day reported the robbery to the
police. . . ;â¢' ' 'â¢ Â¦ .'â¢ ? Â¦:
Chief Hodgkins has been investigating
the matter,', but thus far. has found no
clew. -It !s his opinion that the thugs
followed Qhltng over from San Francisco
on the last . boat. The injury Ohling re
ceived froni being struck on the head la
not serious. . .':-'-::' â¢Â¦ .'-. .-Â¦ .-V.- 1 Â¦â¢. >
NO HOLIDAY FOR FOOTPADS
DEAF AND DUMB
WOMAN HELD UP
BY A FOOTPAD
Mrs. Cronin Robbed
on a Lonely
Road.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Dec. 31.
Footpads make no distinction in the se
lection of their victims, but the height of
the footpads' lowliness and cowardice was
illustrated last night when one of these
marauding gentry attacked a deaf mute
woman, named Mrs. Anna Cronln, who
resides with her aged husband near Rock
ridge Park. Mrs. Cronln returned from
San Francisco late with her basket load
ed down with Christmas goodies, and as
she was walking along the road between
Thermal Vale nursery and the Rookrldge
Park a man stepped out from behind a
bush and halted her. Being deaf and
dumb she could make no outcry and the
footpad quickly searched the woman, re
lieving her of about 70 cents In change
she carried In her pocket. He also took
with him her basket of purchases and
disappeared In the darkness.
A i r . s- Â£. ronln we Â°ded her way homeward
and In the language of the silent explained
everything to her husband, who is also
a deaf mute. To-day he reported the
robbery to Sheriff Rogers.

OWL'S CHRISTMAS.
The Christmas dinner at the Bohemian
Club Saturday night was a pronounced
success In general and creditable in every
detail of service, decoration and cere
mony. It was the third notable achieve
ment of Vanderlynn Stow's administration
bs president of the club. The other two
successful functions were the midsum
mer high jinks and the Christmas jinks.
Two hundred and fifty members Joined
in the feasting Saturday evening. The
table was spread in the new Jinks room.
The ceremonial programme was of this
fashion: '.- ;',; ',
Procession of robed censer boys and choristers,
followed by Chorus Master 11. -J. Stewart,
leading the club members, headed by Presi
dent Vanderlyr.n Ftow. High Priest GÂ«orge T.
Bromley and the Directory. Choristers sing
carolâ "Good Christian Men Rejoice."
Soup is served. J
Steward (followed by servant bearing flsh.
chef accompanying).
The swan, borne aloft by servants, follows the
choristers, who sing:
"God rest you. merry gentlemen."
Choristers enter." Carolineâ
"Caput aprl defero
, Redens laudes Domino!"
and the cooks bring In the hoar's head.
Hearers bring In the baron of beef; choristers
sing carolâ "Cradle Seng."
Plum pudding, garnished with holly and mis
tletoe, ablaze, borne on the shoulders of the
cooks; orchestra playing.
The steward ushers in the wassail bowl, lights
It, and eerves the members.
WASSAIL!
Carolâ "Here we come a-wassalllng."
No programme was ever executed to
the letter In the club. The main departure
on this occasion was insistence by the
feasters that the chef should make a
speech. The fact that he responded in
French did not diminish the volume of
enthusiasm. Â¦'Â¦';.'Â¦
Frederick Warde, the chief after-dlrftiT
speaker, was followed by Uncle George T.
Bromley, who spiced his eloquence with
song. Â¦>;Â¦:.;

PRODUCTION OF GOLD.
Frank A. Leach, superintendent, and
Charles G. Yale, statistician of the United
States Mint, have prepared a preliminary
statement, based on receipts at the Mint
and other bullion depositories on this
coast, which shows that California pro
duced in 1899 gold to.tho amount of $15.
000,000 and silver to $036,000. The increase
over last year Is $561,406 in pold and- J?20,
606 in silver. This Is somewhat unexpected
in view of the record "dry year" through
which the State has just passed. A num
ber of new mining enterprises have been
inaugurated nnd these, with the increase
from the south, have more than made up
the deficiency caused by the lack of water
in the older mining regions. Meantime
advantage has been taken of the low
stage of water to repair and extend
ditches and reservoirs, all of which j will
have an influence in an increased supply
of water and consequently a larger output
of Rold and silver for 1900.
Messrs. Leach and Yale have also pre
pared a corresponding- estimate of the
output of Alaska mines during 1599, which
shows that the territory has doubled its
gold product over the previous year. The
record for 1599 is: Gold, J4.917.521, and sil
ver %S2 Â«<so, as compared with an output
of gold of- $2,517,121 and of silver of $49,
152 In IS9S. This shows an increase for
the year of $2,400,700 in gold' and $33,728
tilver, or a total of $2,434,428. It should
be stated that the returns of the United
States Assay Office at Seattle are includ
ed in this statement as well as those of
the United States Mint and private de
positories.
An attempt has been made In connection
with the Alaska output to. segregate the
amounts of gold received so as to approx
imately determine the yield of the new
gold fields at Cape Nome, about which
many conflicting- ' statements have been
made. It is found that of the total output
of Alaska $2,405,&30 gold and $3335 . silver
came from the beach and placers. of Cape
Nome and vicinity.
In IS9B out of a total gold product of
$11,038,478. from the Klondike $414,295 Was
taken to Eastern mints and assay offices
and not deposited on this coast. A pro
portionate amount has doubtless been
taken East this year, which may be add
ed to the estimate Â»iven. When all the
statements of mints, refineries, assay
offices, etc., are received from all over
the United States, the figures of the out
put of the year -will no doubt be somewhat
larger than those given. . . . â¢

LIEUTENANT FRED L. ESOLA.
county of San Francisco. It has been
known for some time that Mr. Esola was
in high favor with the Mayor and The
Call has been informed by responsible
people, who were either directly or indi
rectly Interested, that in the formation
of the Police Commission his appointment
was a large consideration. In fact, so
firmly convinced was Mayor Phelan that
Mr. Esola would be the right man for the
place that he made his appointment the
test of eligibility and those who expressed
themselves as antagonistic failed to find
their names among the lucky ones wfien
the announcements were made.
Almost at the eleventh hour one of
San Francisco's prominent legal lights
was called In and proffered a commission
ership by the Mayor and apparently only
the formality of his acceptance stood be^
tween him and his appointment. At the
last moment he was asked if he had any
objection to Mr. Esola as Chief of Police
and replied that he had. "Why," asked
Mayor Phelan. "He is a better man than
Lees, is he not?
"I do not think he is," was the reply-
Lees has had long experience and is still
capable and I do not see why he should
be displaced." Mayor Phelan then ex
plained his Interest in his candidate by
saying: '
When Mr. Hearst was out here the last
time he expressed great admiration for
Lieutenant jEsoia and asked me as a per
sonal request to make him Chief of Police
if the opportunity should arise. The op
portunity Is here and I am strongly In
clined to accede to Mr. Hearst's request."
The Mayor's explanation, however, did
not serve to convince Lee's champion and
he left the ottlce. His name also failed
to appear among subsequent announce
ments.
The newly appointed Commissioners are
non-committal when asked as. to their
preference tor the Chief's ofllce, but to
friends all but one of them has expressed
himself as favorable to Lieutenant
Esola's appointment. Mr. Biggy has made
no secret of his loyalty to the Mayor's
choice, William Thomas has said nothing,
but is understood to be of the same mind
and George W. Newhall is known as a
warm friend of Mayor Phelan ana ready
to lend his vote to Esola's case when the
commission shall come together to consid
er the matter. Dr. W. F. McNutt has
said that he would not vote for Esola,
but despite the doctor's denial It is posi
tively known that he will be on hand
when the can comes.
Of the four candidates who at first as
serted their claims to the office only
Esola remains. .Captain Wlttman retired
early in the nght; Colonel W. P. Sullivan
declares that he never was a candidate
and Chief Lees gave up the fight on Sat
urday. Early in the day the Chief was
made aware of the personnel of the new
commission .and calling an expressman he
loaded all of his personal. effects and pri
vate records Into a dray and had them
taken to his home. Lees Is as confident
as are others as wise In politics that
Esola Is to be his. successor.
As stated above, The Call unhesitating
ly predicts that Lieutenant Fred Esola
will be the next Chief of Police. If the
prediction be true The Call hopes that he
will prove a good man In the place. It
will support him In his efforts to do right,
and will not hesitate to crltcize him if he
be ever at fault.^BÃS -. -;c

"On this last day of the year if we

gone, but the present is ours. Shall wÂ«

been? Let us commence to-day."

Â¦ What blessings untold would to us be givenâ Â¦

Rev. Philip Coombe, pastor of the
Richmond Â¦ Congregational Church,
preached yesterday morning on "What
Has the Nineteenth Century Bequeathed
to the Twentieth?" In part he said:. :
The nineteenth century has led us out of thÂ«
dark regions, of atheism aJongr the cold road of
scientific investigation into the pleasant places
of intelligent faith in God, and enterprising: en
deavor for bringing . alt ; the nations of the
earth into the s&ir.e ropdly heritage. How,
then, can we best undertake twentieth century
responsibilities? .
For generations the unborn did with few ad

did In poverty, unappreciated, almost unknown,
their worth unrecognized, until they w*nt to
heaven and heard God say to them each, "Well

to the joy ot thy IxÂ»rd." We must undertake
thÂ» wr>rk that la nearest to our hand and do
It as well and bravely as if God and the whole
world were looklnsr on. Â¦' ' .

All the available police officers In the
city were on duty on Market street from
il:30 o'clock last night until after the new
year was ushered in. Captain Spillane no
tified the men who usually report off duty
at midnight to remain on their beats until
32:30 o'clock, and the relief watch was
ordered out half an hour earlier than
usual. All the officers on the side streets
were also Instructed to patrol Market
street and assist in keeping the crowd In
check.
ARCHDEACON WEBER TO

Make Denial, The Call Is in Pos

CUT HIS BROTHER.
Trouble' in the Italian Colony Over
the Possession of a Oirl.
Two brothers in the Italian colony
quarreled over the possession of a young
girl yesterday, and one cut the other with
a knife. Officers G. W. Haggatt and John
Fleming, who were on duty In the neigh
borhood, responded to a call, and on go
ing to Grant place, which is off Filbert
street, they met Dominick Navarro, who
Informed them that he had been cut by his
brother Salvador. The two brothers wpre
taken to the California-street station. At
the station Dominick exhibited a four-
Inch gash on the inside of his left thigh.
Salvador, the offending brother, was
looked up on the charge of assault with a
deadly. weapon, while the injured man was
taken to the Receiving Hospital for treat
ment.
The cause of the trouble between the
brothers is the possession of the 15-year
old daughter of Dominick, with whom
Salvador is madly in love. The girl's
father objected to the intimacy and, re
fused to give his daughter in marriage to
his brother, not so much, however, on ac
count of relationship as because his broth
er is a bad man. according to his state
ment. Both men are engaged In the ilsh
peddling business and are fairly well to
do.

Died From Lockjaw.
Loula Peterson, the young electrician,
who resided- at lIS Sixth street, died yes
terday afternoon at the County Hospital
from lockjaw. About a week ago he in
jured his foot with a rusty nail. After be

experimented upon him with anti-toxin,
but without success.
THE old year wept mm. a little as It
pase<yl on to join : the has-beens of
the calendar. It was not much of

and it dimmed no enthusiasm and

over the i!ight,of time. There wae a sug
gestion of. the noise, to come even as early
as the afternoon. There w*re no steam
â¢whirtJes to speak, of . except those of the
fiabbath-breaking steamships and locomo
tives., but there were horns and cowbells
'tuning up to swell the chorus due after

jin the faces oi the women and in those
'd the men, too. whenever a too eo
.licitous escort sought to protect the lady
â¢ lie hod rashly i*--ci into the crowd, tine
â¢ had to siand it and so did he, or else go
on the other siae of the street. As tlie
.jiipht wore on, however, tnere was no
'Â«lac of the street to choose from, and
'those who were out at all were caught
Â¦tip t>y the crowd. To save themselves
xr.any stood along the buildings and in the
doorways and looked on, lor it is a
pleasure to watch people who think they
aire enjoying themselves, but even this
refuge ot the non-combatants was linally
raided and every one was hurried along
Jn the living stream that had captured
the city.
Jt was a wild, delirious crowd and one
that stretched to its fullest the license
lent it â or perhaps the license it had
taken upon itself. ; It grew and grew, and
the strokes of the clock multiplied until
when the hour of midnight arrived it was
l. howling, hooting, concourse of lunatics;
a. ri\f-r of noise; a New Year's pande
monium. And then, as the horns rasped
the air to greet the bells that rang out
the last <>f the year, some one with music
in his soul and a sense of the fitness of
things stepped out into Market street and
blow taps upon his bugle. The old year
<Ud well. Jt had much to Its credit and
not much to blajne. and it must have had
the satisfaction when it left the crowds
upon vlk- streets that if the people it had
served wore not really happy at least they
thought they were.
All tho timo the people Â¦ were raising
riot in the streets, the churches were
crowded with others who had a different
Â¦way of spoinp the old year out. At every
houf.e of worship thore were services, and
at nearly cli the services held were pe

"The B*-IJs of l!Â«0O" -was the subject of
