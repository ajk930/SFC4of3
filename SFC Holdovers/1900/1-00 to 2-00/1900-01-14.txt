into her hands and glared savagely at the boy playing
Eand pies outside.
"Your auntie was just showing me this picture of
you when you were a little girl," I remarked casually
from the depths of the family album. Â¦ "It must have
been takls ages ago."
"H'm. That's awful old. Taken when I lived at the
lighthouse."
"Lighthouse? What lighthouse?"
".'Point Conception." '
"Was it fun there?"
"You bet it was fun. That's where I learned 'to
shoot.. Papa Young gave me a rifle and ..we used *o
climb over the rocks and hunt all day. We'd fish, too.
I was only 8 years old when we left there. Sometimes
I guess I'd like to be back an' have some more fun
with him. He's dead now."
"An' that's his picture, lookin' as if he was talkin'
to you," put in Mrs. Young.
I wriggled secretly and sought relief by asking if the
shooting was good thereabouts.
"Bad. The ducks don't fly, an' I don't shoot unless
they do. Sometimes it's pretty good over to Lake
Merced, but not now. Lake^ Merced's back here just
a little way, you know. That's the only place I go to
shoot."
"Lillie won't shoot a duck except on the wing,
That's why we ain't havin' so many duck dinners just
now. But she's a good shot Go get your rifle and
show the lady, Lillie."
"Aw-r." She glared into the outdoors once more.
We left the rifle subject drop.
', "What do you find to do around here in the place of
fishing?" ;
"Aw,- there's ridin'.' I ride bareback a lot."
"She can jump a horse that's runnin' in the field an'
ride off bareback on it."
' "SJbx'a knna'.ivhjw.^o. lasso, any thins from pigs to
runnin' loose outdoors."
"Don't see why they" should yell at me just becanj*
I do." â¢ ' - x
"Do they, really?"
"Yes, they yell 'tomboy,' and they run" after me com
in' home." â¢ %>% >
"Then what do you do?"
"I give 'em what they need when they get too fresh.
See this hat? It looks bad to-day, but it had. some
trimmin' on yesterday. A boy swiped it off and
climbed up on the house with it. Then he yelled."
"What did you do?"
"What did I do? H'm. I made him come down.
What did you think I'd do?"
"There, don't speak so rough. How you do talk,
Lillir
"Aw, get out."
"There, hear that. But I hate to put any restraint
upon her," Mrs. Young ventured timidly.
"Aw," said Lillie. "I ain't rough. They say a tot
o' things about me that ain't so. I'll lick 'em if they
say I'm rough."
As I snapped the album shut a loose picture fell to
the floor. I picked it up. It was a half-tone- cut from
some magazine, a copy of one of Sir Joshua's ladies of
long ago.
"A man sent that in a letter to auntie. He said that
was how I'm goin' to look some day when I grow up."
I looked at the majesty, the calm, the commanding
gentleness. I looked at the lanky, jersey-clad figure
opposite, the rude hat jerked forward out of shape. It
was absurd. But when I looked at the real eyes and
the picture eyes I was startled. They were so alike
that the one's might have served as models for the
other's.
. "Do you think you will grow to look like her?"
"I don't know. She's a lot prettier'n I am. She'i
awful pretty. Don't you think so?"
It was so wistful, pathetic. She will 'Hick 'em" be
cause they call her rough and so lead them on to call
her rougher. And all the time she will steal into the
coH 'little straight-lined parlor when nobody is around
and peep at the beautiful, dainty lady in the album and
wonder if she will ever grow to be like that
And I wondered what kind of a man he was that sent
the picture and what he thought when he sent it? Did -
he mean it for a cruel, taunting joke? Or' did he really'
notice the eyes? SARAH COMSTOCK. '
"Sh-sh! Never mind. Come into the parlor."
"I won't never mind, an' I won't 'sh-sh.' Who is it,
I say?"
There was some whispering, some grunting, then
louder remonstrance. "I don't want to see the com
p'ny. I tell you I haven't got time. After I get
through hangin' by my heels I've got to go and dig
that^ posthole. Who'll do it, I'd like to know, if I
don't? You can't get your new gate hung till the post
holes are dug.'can you?"
In the midst of all which Lillie entered and gave
me a cloudy reception.
Fifteen, they say. Taller already by a half head than
the timid, toddling little foster mother, and there is^
time to grow more. She is long and spare and sinuous,
firm footed and clear eyed and ruddy checked with
Saxon ruddiness. She wore a close, short skirt, heavy
shoes, clinging sweater and soft hat pulled low.
She stood 'before me in a mood of lurking mutiny
and said, "Yes. ma'am," in the voice of-.an angry con
vict. But I did not ask her how old she was nor
whether she had any little brothers and sisters nor
even what she got for Christmas." If conditions had
been a little more favorable I think she and I might
have got along in time. Â¦>;; : ,
"Sit down and talk to the lady, Lillie dear," said
Mrs. Young.
"Aw-r," said Lillie. It might have been the word o(
a dog whose bone is in danger. But she did sit down
and leaned her elbows on the sill and , s un k her chin
horses ever since she was born," said Mrs. Young. '
i "Aw."
"Well, you can." -
"That's nothin'."
"Well, I guess it's a good deal. Don't you say so?"
i Yes, I said so.
, "An' she can box, too. Papa Young taught her to
box. He thought a lot of her, an' she did of him â
didn't you? She's never had any regular lessons, but*
she'd like to have. Wouldn't you?"
"Aw."
"She" hasn't got any gloves, but she can use 'em a
little. She boxes with the knuckles bare, though."
"Look here, now, I ain't goin' to have people think
I'm a fighter. I ain't. I don't hit anybody that don't
hit me first. They yell at me an' I have to hit 'em."
"Why do they yell at you?"
"Aw, I don't know. 'Cause they're mean. 'Cause
I wear this sweater, maybe."
"Now, Lillie, there's nothing the matter ;with that
sweater. It's a bicycle sweater, isn't it?"
f I was sure it was a bicycle sweater. Did she ride a
wheel? W, '
"She can, but she hasn't got one. She'd like to,
though. You'd ride a wheel if you had one, wouldn't
you, Lillie?" ' . ' â¢â¢'. v
"What do you s'pose I'd do? Stand it up in the
corner of the parlor to look at?"
"Well, there, of course not."
A feeble little dog whimpered at the door. "Aw. it's
Dicksoh," Lillie. said. '"Come in,, poor little Dick.
He's sick." she explained: .
She picked him up in her lanky arms and soothed
his' sorry feelings. "He'll be all right pretty soon â
soon's I nurse him up," she said. "He's got a pretty
bad foot, but I know how to take care of it. Don't I,
Dickie? Poor little Dick! Did it hurt him so bad?"
"It's time for you to set the table. Lillie."
"I don't want to set the table. Didn't I tell you I
have to dig that post hole? I can't bother about tables."
"She does hate to work in the house. She used to
like school, pretty well, though. She was smart in
school, but when she, got through the sixth grade she
quit. She likes ;to run outdoors, an' I hate to check
her. I say there's worse things she might be doin'.
There's Lola, Mr.jTempleford's only child, mind you;
she went clear through the eighth grade an' now she's
slingin' beer in a dive. So there's worse things than
* TO, I don't want to fight," says Lillie Young,
/\ I "but I can hold a glove with any boy, that's
1 y what." You must go a long way to hear her
\^ szy it. Away from hubbub, out to where green
sweeps flank the Ocean View road. Pass the gardens
where fat little lettuces are huddling these days and
where spindlc-slianked onions are striding. Go far
ther yet, until you hear the ruthless guffaw that an
engine blurts upon the heart-healing air and see its
daub of smoke that smears a clean sky. Then in a
minute you are at Ocean View and you must walk three
or four long drawn out Ocean View blocks, and just
as Capitol street begins to climb the hill beyond the
eand path you will come to a mite of a clean white
house and that is where Lillie Young, the tomboy of
tomboys, lives.
Mrs. Young took me into the parlor. It is a parlor
of marble-topped center table and family portaits on
the installment plan and shells drawn up in line around
the hearth. Mrs. Young approached the room def
erentially.
"Lillie is very busy," she said doubtfully, "and I
don't know whether she'll see you. She's tryin' to see
how long she can hang by her heels to the north limb
of the live oak tree."
Then I heard her calls of "Lillie" diminish kitchen
trard and at last a big hoarse voice responded, "WhatF'
"There's a lady to Eec you, Lillie dear."
"Who?"

WHAT IS COSTS TO DRESS WELL
2
THE Etace*StrocX tfrl nas Known
from time immemorial all about the
necessity of beauty, brains and tal
ent. Equipped with enough of all
these to throw to the birds, she en
?<=rs the world of calcium lishtcd gowna.
Ene looks for the gowns to descend upon
her from the heavenly files above, and
the wearing of them will be worth work
ins for.
It fo happens that when once she has
entered .-he finds that the way the gowns
descend is something like this. Suppose
her to bo assigned the place of Juvenile in
a stock company. She draws a satary of
J* Â¦ to JTS per week and is told to make'
that cover VJ<> worth of costume?. She
may eat ar.d lodge, provided she saves
money on the transaction.
Probably pbe prows "tearful when the
facts dawn niwn her. She flees to moth
erly arms ar.d listens to motherly coun
sel, which runs in this wise:
"That old white batiste will be Just a'
p<x>d as new after I've pressed it. And
you can wear turquoise velvet with It this
week arid pink ribbons r,e*r. and it will
be just the sam** as two gowns."
A UttJeof which advice may be followed
T\i:h negative results. But let her push
c-eonorr.y further ar.d try the batiste with
a yellow sash the third w<*ek, and the Ju
venile has word from her manager.
Miss Juliet Crosby opened a box couch
bs she talked ar.d let loose the scent of
rr.ar.y moth balls In the little sitting-room.
It is a dapper Bitting roorn.ihis one. where
r friend can chat with herâ as dapper as
En Alcazar stage setting. Inside the box
touch lay the 4ear departed.
They are her gowns. "An average of
four a play, ar.d forty plays In the year.
Here are the remains, and what is to bo
finne with them?"
She lifted a pearl-gray silk, through tht
Flashes of which pleated taffeta caught
Fhlfsing opal lights. "Forty dollars for
that,*! she eald. "Thirteen yards of taf
feta went into it. and the pleating cost a
reat little sum. As for the making â of
course, the profession get special ratct
trcm resruiariy employed dreÂ«sniakcrs.
Miss Crosby let the silk drop lingeringly
into the easy chair. "It was such a dear
dress," she fighed. "And what is it good
for, now that it has been worn?"
"Wear it again."
"That can't be done In less than a yo^r,
or it will be recognized. And by that time
the styles will have changed, and you
know that It's easier In theory" than Jn
practice to rehash small sleeves into bis
ones qr tight skirts into full. Cloth that
isn't there can't be created."
Ye gods, don't we know? More's the
pity.
"This little white sailor suit w!th the 'red
trimming was a temptation that was just
too much for me. I might have been rafo
if the suit had cnlv remained on thÂ» Â«vioif
vat I can't get an i laborate gown like that
made for less than $10."
Fhe turned the smart little bodice over
and showed the wrong (ride. Whalebone
were neatly cased and seams all overcast.
"We don't fake," she said.
"People talk about faking en the etage.
They are the people who know only tenth
rate actresses. Suppose I had used some
Fhoddy material in the place cf this taf
feta; it would never have had any crisp
r.C!=s ar.d style. Faking does not pay, and
will not be tolerated by any kind of a
manager. Th* money fpent In stage cos
tumes is not the indulgence of luxurious
tastes; it is the investment of capital."
but it had the audacity to flaunt itself in
the ftore window, and I gave in helplessly.
It cost? twice as much to buy ready made,
but I had been thinking and thinking
what to wear for a certain part, and I
couldn't decide until I s-aw this. It'an
swered all my question."
The snappy little suit fell upon the pearl
Bl'.k. "Next." she said, and dived again..
Up came a black lace over yellow petti
coat. "Now here is ono of the few real
economies that one can practice. This
lace Is of good nujility and car. be made
to do duty over black or a light color. an|i.
will bear xnany changes without growlrfe
tire.-c.mc to playgoers."
It v was a heavy flowered net that swung
out in great creeping folds over the sun
colored satin. It was a gown to respond
to nothing less than *'madame," and
might have laid claim to "Your ladyship."
A fluffy Hi tie organdie fluttered down on
the lace. 'These simple dresses can be
'iad for JlO, making and all. They help
us save for larger expenses. But they
don't last. We drag them over rough
stairs and scramble in them be-twc#i
â¢ragged-edged scenes and past lumber. :jee
this miserable little darnâ lucky it came
in a figure- and didn't Dhow so much as
it might have. That darn is here because
a lawn party tree came into collision with
me one night in its hurry to make way for
a flight of stairs. I paid 'Dear, dear,' but
that didn't mend the gown.
"It makes me weary when I recall thfr
time and labor spent on this red poplin.
The shopping for it took all one Tuesday
afternoon, and it was so elaborate that it
had to have four fittings Instead of the
customary two."
The gorgeous moire skirt colored w'.th
tho lights of old wine stood majestically
of itself. White silk made the bodice
yoke, and Intricate precessions of .little
bows, every one choked by a steel buckle,
formed countermarching lines.
"Thofce buckles are all to be ripped off
to-day to. trim a black cloth." That ia a
tiny shiftâ but as lor the gown itselfâ it
Js &o striking thp.t I shduld- never daro
wear U on tho same stage again, and
there is no possibility except In having It
dyed.
"Isn't it disgusting to think of all the
money wo arc obliged to spend, when a
man can make ten suits last for a whole
season? A few hats, two or three over
coats, and he is supplied for all his
straight parts in .society plays. Now and
then a costume play is produced, and
then the expense la heavy for men find
women alike. When we put on 'The- Mus
keteers' I did not attempt to buy my
queen costumes, but rented both of them
at a cost of 525 apiece for two weeks." .
The sweeping white albatross that
trained through "Under Two Flags" for
the Princess Corona appeared further
down. Dashing frogs of white military
braid adorned the front of the Jacket.
"When I read the play I seemed to see
exactly how the Princess would dress.
There Is the dignity to be expressed, and
that little military touch suggests a fad.
"Now think of what the making of all
these i clothes Involves. On Tuesday
comes the first rehearsal for the play that
Is to have its first presentation the fol
lowing Monday night. We don't plan our
costumes until that rehearsal is over at
2 o'clock. We can't tell until then ex
actly what we are going to need. Then,
after a hurried lunch, the shopping be
gins.
"I usually get two gowns started on
Tuesday, the other two on Wednesday.
Friday cornea the first fitting and Monday
the other, then I do not see tho gowns
again until I go to the theater. My dress
maker has never failed me, for she know*
the necessity of being prompt.
"Once in a while I fail myself, though,"
she added with a reminiscent little laugh.
"The other night I found I had forgotten
my stock collar, and one of the girls sug
gested that I use a shirred garter. And I
didâ wasn't It ridiculous? But I'm sura
nobody knew."
She let a rose pink matinee drift slowly
npon thÂ© heap. "There's several dollars*
worth of nothing." she said. "The little
things count up dreadfully, don't they?
After the gowns, which range from ?5 to
?4Q, have been bought, we have to con
sider hats. I average two a week. Moat
of them arc made on wire frames so that
they can be bent Into new shapes, and I
have several sets of plumes that can ba
used over and over. My milliner chargea
I! or J5 for making over a hat.
"Gloves must be taken into account.
They average two pairs for each play,
and they last half through the week.
That means four pa'.rs, an expense of il
a week. I don't clean mine often. Don/t
you hate, cleaned gloves?
"Slippers and hosiery must match. Six
dollars a week pays, for slippers. And
every woman knows what the accessories
mean. Collars and ribbons and bits of
chiffon nonsense. Three dollars a weeli
is a moderate estimate for the?e things.
"So you see what the outlay is for an
actress in a stock company. Star 3 ppen.l
larger sums, of course, but they do not
keep changing. For Instance. Mrs. Les
lie Carter went to Paris and spent about
JSOOO on tho eight costumes for Zaza. but
they were the only ones she needed. I*
must be so satisfactory to spend the timÂ»
needed to study every costume out and
the artistic expression of each one. Do
you remember where she is called 'Poor,

'bedazzled' was her clew, and from i* she

WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR BEST GIRL SAY "YES"
THERE are man/ times in a man's life when he
precipitates himself into a situation which suddenly
brings him face to face with a crisis which, in the
choice English of the day, --'keeps him guessing."
It is saic to assume that the real crisis of a man's life
comes when he contemplates matrimony seriously
enough to dwell upon the price of fried potatoes for
two. and to become absorbed in and with the installment
furniture" advertisements, which offer things at rates suf
ficiently low as to almott be an inducement to man to
niarry. But when the best girl replies in the affirmative
and her "yes"' doesn't mean "no," as her "no" might
mean "ye.-."' is the time that he must act "and act quick.
It is impossible to say what a man should do in thiÂ»
try:ng situation by reference to the acts of others similar
ly situated, because no man has ever told what he di-i.
â¢perhaps for the reason that he was so overcome by joy
st the supreme moment of his triumph that he cannot
remember any of the particulars. It is fair to assume
that no two men act alike Â« hen she says "yes** at the
t:rr.e pi the proposition to pay for her hats and other
luxuries. Men being of tiirTercnt temperaments, it is.
not likely that tiieir actions are the same.
If a phlegmatic man should act precisely as a nerv
ous nan does, or if a man 45 years old with yellow hair
sho-jM act in a manner not unlike that of a man 65 yeirs
old, with a wen on his neck, it would go to prove that
the business of proposal and acceptance^ a very pro=>aic
and unpoctic proceeding after all. Then the surround
ings might exert a certain influence. A plumber in the
moonlight by the bobbing sea might be surcharged with
halcyon dreams that would cause him to be a different
sort of being from that which he might be if he were
accepted in a thunder storm while awaiting a flash of
lightning to satisfy him that he is really on the earth.
It js not en easy thing by a long shot" to say what 2
rr.an ought to do v.hen his best girl says "yes" in re
sponse to the very important and momentous question.
It would be ?.s easy, perhaps, to say what the girl
should do when the question is put to her.
It might be well to ascertain from marricl women
how their husbands acted when they replied in the af
firmative. Possibly they remember, and if such data
could be obtained ;t; t would not only make fine reading,
but supply a solid baiis. for such in article as this.
Nov.-. how does a woman act. and what docs she 'lo
when s-J-.c proposes to a man and the latter says "yes?"
Does she jump to sec if her hat is on straight, or'does
she say she has forgotten her gloves in the excitement
that causes her to forget that she Iras them on? And
suppose a Mormon proposes to three women at the
the same time and in sporting parlance "takes three
straight."' Whatever he docs, doesn't be do three time-.
z* m;:oh of it as he would if the trio had refused hini r
Would he embrace them all at once, or one at a time'
If one at a time Xo. .3 would be madder than No. 2. Xo
2 would be madder than Xo. 1 and gladder than Xo. V,
while Xo. 1 would be h?ppier than Xo 2 and Xo. 3 com
bined^ And if he embraced and kissed them all at once
and all together, there would be no proof of favoritism
and consequently no cause for jealouiy. vhich would be
unsatisfactory, as it would prove the existence of a man
v.ho could love with equal desperation and intensity
three women rt one and the same time.
Let t:s imagine the following conversation after the
above purely imaginary scene:
"Why did you embrace us all ?.t once?"
"Because," replies the thrice happy man, "you are
'.-.vice as much numerically this way."
"But we don't understand you."
"Of course you don't, but I understand my business.
1 consider in the arithmetical light of' one. t .vo.
hrce. which added together makes six. Yet shall I
)e. happiest on that happy day that shall see us made
Th3t would be the way a man should act in the event
â¢f nich a cm is.
Once upon a tinir I was wandering along the sea
hor<- in the bright silvery spray of a full moon. a.nd at
my vide was a languid, high-strung gazelle, who was
usually gloomy a/id pensive as if lost in the tangles
f some kind of a divine despair that defied dyspepsia
:ablets. Finally we paused, and she, wringing her
lainty jeweled fingers, looked at me in a way that
aroused n] y sympathy and said:
v hy was I ever put -into this weary, weary world?"
' In order." I replied quickly, "to be a reason and an
r.c\i*e for my existence."
The crisis was safely paÂ«sed a moment later. Now
vhst d:d I do? Did I say: "What kind of an engage-
ment ring do you want, and how soon do you want it;
or shall we board with your mother or take a flat? I
did not say any of one of these things. I took out a
memorandum book and began to write.
"What arc you doing-?" she asked.
"Nothing," I replied.
With a woman's chain-lightning intuition she said:
"Are you making a memorandum of the fact that we
are engaged; do you think that otherwise you would
forget it,' and do you think I could forget to remind you
of it if you should?"
A month later, when we were back in town, I said
to her:
"Do you remember how I made a memorandum that
moonlight night on the Wellfleet sands?"'
"I do." she said.
"Well, it was simply a memorandum of the fact that
when you asked me why you were put into this weary
world. I told you it was to be a reason and an excuse
for my existence, which question and answer I this day
Â«old to a comic paper for $J to print under a Bar Har
bor society cut. Thus may you see. my dear, how the
high-handed poet turns everything into gold when h:
has the hard horse sense of the man that sells hams on
commission-"
It will thus be seen that what you should do in the
crisis that ensues when your best girl says ''yes" de
pends largely upon the nature and conditions of the
crisis. It might be unwise to say just what you should
do. because you would probably forget it and do some
thing else and thus upset all calculations. It is a time
when you will do something and you will always do
something that will fill the bill, even if you do make a
fool and a goose of yourself. But if the best girl shall
only prove to be the right girl, no matter what you do
in the crisis of her acceptance you will always say that,
although you did make a fool and goose of yourself.
you can still always congratulate yourself on the fact
that you proved yourself a level-headed philosopher of
the highest type in the long run in winning the object
of your quest.knows how to gret it. Aside from the 6>
sire of making a fortune I want to live
again In the hum of a mining town. When
all is said against a'mining camp mining
Is still the cleanest business that a man
can engage in. For everything else you
must barter and dissemble, but mining is
a first principle propositionâ lf you strike
it, there's your gold ready to use without
even a middleman between you and the
market.
There isn't any other occupation In
which hope dies bo hard as in mining

havoc with his millions, and when

the hotel was destroyed rumor
whispered that Baldwin s luck had
gone to rcost elsewhere. Gossip in
sists that when "Lucky" Baldwin
pays the mortgage on his Santa
Anita ranch with the money real

"Lucky" Baldwin believes that
he can retrieve his vanished mil
liens. Although he has passed the
allotted "threescore crui ten" he is
going to try his luck in the gold
fields of Cape Nome. ,!h the days

From the day I landed in San Francisco
in the winter of 1553 I began to work for
big money. The water came up to Mont
gomery street then, which was filled with
old hulks. I rented the Pacific Temper
ance house, turned it Into a hotel, work
ed day and night and In a few days it
was the best paying house in town. I ran
the hotel just two weeks and then sold
out, making J7OOO on the deal.
The next thing I went into was the
brickmakirg business. I saw that la *
very short time the Government would
need bricks for Fort Point and Fort Al
catraz. Now, I didn't know a brick from
a stone, but I kept that to myself. I
went Into partnership with a man who
had a small brickyard and learned all I
could watching the men. At night I used
to read up anything that I could find oa
the subject of bricks. I was afraid to
ask questions, for fear It would be found
out that I didn't know bricks from cobbles.
At the end of two months I dissolved
co constructed that it will be the work
of but a few hours to put it together.
At present I have not decided to what
use I Fhall put the lror. building. A man
has to be on the spot to declds that. 11l

theaterâ lnto the one thins that Nome

The papers have stated that I am going
to t&ka a movable theater to Nome and

sult my ollicfi Is snowed under with appli
cations frcin people all over the Union. I
believe I'vo heard from aimost every act
ress in the country who is out of a posi
tion. I wish to state positively that I am
not hunting for theatrical stars. Song and
dance artists, tragedy queens, contortion
ists and ballet girls will have to look else
where for an employer.
When I decide to use? the building as a
theater it will be time enough to engage a
company. As 1 said before, it will be a
building suitable i'or any or every purpose,
but to what particular use it will be put
can only be positively stated when we
have landed at Nome.
There are several reasons why I am go
ing to Nome. One is that I think there is
plenty of money there for the man who
all luck is, and therefore I believe I'll be
as lucky in the future as I have been In
the past. Every man makes his own luck.
The lucky man is a rustler and his luck
is in himself, not in his stars. The man
who rustles is the man who succeeds.
They call me "Lucky" Baldwin, but I
know of but one time in my life that I
won out on pure luck. When I was In
Japan in the seventies I lent a foreign
Consul there a large sum of money. He
returned it with a very valuable and pe
culiar ring, which he piaced on my finger
for good luck. The ring was greatly ad
mired In San Francisco, but I never
thought of its bringing me any luck. At
that time Canton and Evcretts were deal
ing in stocks. Everett took a particular
fancy to the ring and wanted to buy, beg
or borrow It; but I would not part' with
the gift. One day he offered to carry 500
shares of Crown Point for me if I would
let him wear the ring for six months.
Crown Point was worth about $3 a share
at that tinie. I told Everetta he was
childish, but agreed to let him wear the
ring.
I forgot all about my five hundred shares
until Crown Point began to boom. I sold
out at the right time V:th a clear profit
of $101.1,000. Now. that was luck, pure and

ent directions. I had brought alone Â»
wagon load of teas and tobacco, which I
sold to Walker Brothers at a good profit.
Two other wagons were stocked with fine
brandies and wines. Brlgham Young gent
hia brother out to our camp to negotiate
for these and I finally sold them to him
at my own price.
Brlgham Young's brother came to the
camp dally and gave us much friendly ad
vice about the route to take on the rest
of the journey. He urged me to depart
from the road usually chosen by travelers,
insisting that the other was easier, safer,
and that we could find better feed for the
horses, .We took his advice.
It was Just after the famous Mountain
Meadow massacre by the. Utah Indiana
and we were naturally fearful of meeting
the same fate. But Brlgham Young's
brother assured us that by traveling over
the road he had mapped out we would es
cape all danger.

ing breakfast, when suddenly a shot from
the rocks above pierced the coffee pot,
spilling the coffee over the coals. Wo

of wild Indian yells. Mrs. Baldwin put
our 2-year-old baby in the safest spot In
the wagon and. bravely stood out of cover
and loaded guns for me. One of my shots
laid low their chief, and the Indians, wild
with 1 rage, came closer to the wagons.
An Indian laid hands on a young girl
crouched in the back of the wagon and
would have escaped with her had not one
of our party shot him Just in time.
War-whoops, were now heard In the
distance and the Indians retreated, evi
dently to join another band. They left
nine of their party dead behind
them, but we ourselves had several
wounded. I have always believed and
still think that Brlgham Young's brother
was the causa of the Indian attack, and
while I have no positive proof, I am In
clined to think that he was with them
disguised aa an Indian, for the road that

long as I live, but I have too much energj
to hibernate and am really best contented
when working. So I am going to have
another bout with fortune.
I shall trust no more to "luck" In the
future than I ever did. I'll watch for good
opportunities and seize them. The Ophir
deal was my big opportunity in the* past.
On the day that the directors of ths Ophir
met to freeze me out I knew that one
member would be absent, but heard that
the president intended voting both as
president and member, which would give
the Ralston faction three votes against
my two. I went to my lawyer, Reuben
H. Lloyd, and told him to get out an In
junction. There was twenty minute*
'lacking in which to get out that injunc
tion, but I said go ahead anyway. Then I
went to the meeting, broke up the furni
ture, knocked one man under the table,
covered another with a pistol and kept
things lively until Lloyd got there with
the injunction. It was fighting, not luck,
that saved me.
Some day I may write a book and tell
the inside facts of that and other bis
deals. It will read more like fiction than
fact, and would easily furnish material
for a dozen plays more exciting than the
"Henrietta."
Just now it looks astfa syllable ought
to be added to my titleâ "unlucky" would
sound more appropriate. But give me
three years' time and I'll make good my
ancient right to "Lucky."
It is said that I trusted so much In my
luck that I never Injured any of my prop
erty. It wasn't that I had faith in my
luck, but it is a fact that I never cared
to insure my property. I kept an insur
ance account and up to the time of the
hotel fire I v.as $500,000 ahead. When I
built the Baldwin Hotel I first leased the
ground on which it stood and afterward
bought it. The hotel cost, when it,wa3
finished. $2,000,000, and $200,000 was after
ward put into it for improvements. The
hotel paid an Interest of $150,000 a year, so
It wasn't a bad investment. The house
stood for years without an insurance and
only the year before it was burned did I
take out a policy for $3),000. I had been
warned that a certain party had threat
ened to burn my hotel and that was tha
parmcrsnip ana went mio outincss oy
myself. My yard couldn't turn out the
bricks fast enough to supply the demand
for them. Some of the first bricks I sold
were to the central in command of the
fort. He said they were the finest bricks
ever made i:i San Francisco, and in a few
weeks 1 x\ as turning out bricks for the
Goverr.mrnt at a handsome salary. Not
a man in the yard but thought I was a
reaFtrr brickmaker. ar.d I was before I
got through.
That"* what people call luck, but It was
nothing but hard work. It just shows that
a man can do anything if he makes up
his mind to it ar.d works. Without know
ing a thing about it I went into brkk
nafcir.g ar.d made a bigger success of it
than any other man in the business at
that r:me.

up and shake a foot of snow off my blan

"plucky."
A man named Howard and ; another
whose name I have forgotten were with
me on that trip to Nevada in IS^9. After
a great many hardships we reached
Strawberry, a place near the divide In
the high Sierras. We were determined to
push on. though the people warned U3
that a big snowstorm was in the air." We
pooh-poohed their warnings, for we'd
gone through any number of snowfalls.
But they were all babies compared to this
fellow. The snow came down in chunks
the snow-covered mountains as was
"Snowshoe."
We got to Nevada just in time for the
Ormsby massacre. Our tents were pitched
back of the Ormsby house, and we saw
the boys brought in dead, the victims of
Indian arrows. About a week after that
we had a little Indian affair of our own.
We had taken our pack mules and were
out prospecting at some new diggings.
At night we built a big bonfire and were
just settling down to pipes and stories
when we noticed a crawling line of thin
blue smoke on an opposite hillside. In-
caught hold of the mule's tail, and swam
back'of.him, the others following my ex
ample. The Indians fired a shot or two,
but missed us. Once across the river. we
were soon In Carson City, and a detach
ment of soldiers was sent out from the
city to give chase to the Indians. '
* Even after such experiences In Nevada
I went back again in time for the Corn
stock excitement. It was in those days
that I went into stocks and big deals.
The Ophir deal was the one that won me
the title "Lucky." There was no luck
about it. I came out about five million
they could.
Because I was supposed. to be naturally
"lucky" people would dog my footsteps
and hang around ray office begging
for a tip on the market. The women
stock dabblers were the most persistent

than the men, because you couldn't throw
them downstairs.

MEXICAN DOLLARS AND A PHONOGRAPH CONQUERED SUTU
To- an officer in General Bates' command
in the Philippines is attributed the follow
ing story of our new "fellow citizen," the
Sultan of Sulu:
The Charleston, It seems, was sent to
take possession of the Sulu Islands, but
the commander of that ship, preferring
peaceable means to warlike measures,
sent a cordial invitation to the ruler of the
group asking him to come aboard for
tlffln. The royal personage readily accept
ed, and on his arrival alongside the ship
was saluted with seventeen guns, which
so flattered his self-esteem -that he
stepped on deck swelling with pride and
puffed up with importance. With much
empressement the distinguished guest was
conducted to the captain's cabin and seat
ed where the breeze of an electric fan fell
full upon him. Wonderingly he peered
around to see where the mysterious
breeze came frcra, and finally his inter
preter asked the cause for the refreshing
wind when the air was quite still outside.
The fan was brought and placed In front
cf the Sultan. Delighted beyond measure,
he watched Its revolving and questioned
the officers about this wonderful machine
which could create breezes that should
come only, from heayenY "Would It stop
some time, or would It go. on forever?"
"Blow en it." he was instructed. "The
machine is entirely under your control
and will do your bidding."
The Sultan blew his royal breath, when
lo! the fan stopped. Aghast at his power,
he asked the officers eagerly what should
be done to start it again. "Blow once
more," he was told, and at his breath its
whirring began. Carried away by â¢ this
new experience his Royal Highness played
with the toy until the engineer, concealed
from view, must have become weary with
turning the current on * and off at the
whim of the astoni.shed padlshah.
Before he had tired of the fan the elcc-
trie lights were shown to him, and he was
permitted to turn -them on and off by
blowing against the glass bulbs. Already,
It is said, he began to think it would be a
good idea to swear allegiance to the Gov
ernment of a. country whence such things
emanated, but his subjugation was com
pleted by the phonograph and the <jhink

he had ever seen before. The box con
taining the imprisoned human soul was
brought out. It spoke to him. it sang for
him, but it was a trick, a joke; it was in
a strange language;, he, would see. His
interpreter, was instructed to talk to it.
Here, was a wonder indeed; the thing
talked back. It repeated the exact words
of his secretary, in the same tone of voice
even. Would they give this wonderful box
and some of the Mexican dollars, of which
they seemed to have so many, if he would
s.!gn the treaty? The conquest was com
plete, if bloodless, and when the seven
teen guns boomed over the water as lie
left the ship his chest could hardly con
tain his swelling heart.

and so fast we could not follow our tracks
for twenty paces back and could not see
ahead at all.
There was a fallen tree lodged against
a standing one and into this crevice the
three of us crept. We had lost our
matches, and a search through all our
pockets brought forth just three matches.
We picked twigs and limbs from the
fallen tree, shook off the snow, and shel
tering the blaze from the wind with our
blankets we finally got a weak little flame
that was kept alive by small twigs, and
sheltered from the wind by the blankets
at last blazed into a small fire.
Then we snuggled into the crevice,
wrapped the blankets around us, thinking
that in spite of all we would freeze to
death. But as soon as the storm abated
somewhat the people of Strawberry sent
out "Snow-shoe" Thompson, the mountain
mall carrier, to rescue us.
We were half frozen when "Snowshoe"
found us. We drew straws with chatter-
Ing teeth to see who should go back first.
I think it was Howard who made the first
trip. He put his feet on the back of
Thompson's snowshoes, his arms around
Thompson's r.eok and away they slid
down the eight mountain miles to Straw
berry.
It was all right going down, but it was
slow work for Snowshoe Thompson
climbing up hill again. We thought he
would never get back, and our hopes
were down to zero again when- we heard
his cheery "Hello!" I've covered ground
in a good many waysâ from an elephant's
back in India and a Jlnriklsha in Japan
to the fastest coach and eight in Califor
niaâbut that ride on the back of those

property on Commercial street and
turned it into a livery stable, which I ran
for pome months and then sold out at a
\>'.g profit. To be a success you've got to
keep an eye on two endsâ when to go into
a deal and when to get outâ and don't
waste ar.y time doing cither.
After I sold out the livery stable I
flatted on a trip around the world, with
a couple of Englishmen and two Scotch
men. We hunted big game In India and
had tome experiences and narrow es
capes there that make me shiver now
when I think of them. There's life for
youâ on an elephant's back in the jungle.
It was on this trip that I got my "lucky"
ring in Japan. I also brought back with
me a company of Japanese and Chinese
actors. I played them in every big min
ing camp in California, making gold dust
by the sackful out of them. Then I took
the company East, finally playing them in
New York at the Academy of Music for
eight Â¦weeks to the biggest business .that
theater had tver had.

pood common sense. I knew that Orien

other piece of property Insured.
For years I ran both the hotel and the
theater personally. The Baldwin Theater
opened with Barry Sullivan as thÂ«
attraction. I have one of the pro
grammes of the first performance and the
day after the fire we found In the ruins
a programme of the last performance ever
held In the theater. It 13 charred and
burned around the edges, but I Intend
framing these two programmes, one dated
1575 and the other 1599.
I thoroughly believe that the burning of
the Baldwin Hotel will prove a piece of
good fortune. On my ranches In Southern
California, besides stock and fruit, we
raised a large-sized mortgage. I Intend
paying that oft with the money realized
from the sale of the Baldwin Hotel prop

or stone that belongs to me.
For the last ten years I hare wanted to
go back to mining. I don't mean that I
wanted to get gold out with a pick, a
shovel and rocker. But I like to prospect
and always do my own expertln*. If I
get hold of anything good I'll know tt and
I'll put men to work getting It out In the
quickest and best way. Now that the
hotel Is oft my hands I can carry out my
wishes. Having had the- place so long,
although I had not run It personally of
late years, I naturally did not want to
part with It. If It hadn't burned down I
would never have been footloose to go
to Nome. I haven't a doubt that five
years from now I will think It was a
stroke of good fortune that the hotel
burned.

have ruined a number of people, but for
reasons of my own did not do so.
Those were the days of gigantic manipu
lations In stocks, and a man that had a
finser in the pic didn't need to look else
where for excitement. I pulled out scan
pretty juicy plums, though Mackay and
the rest of thorn were gobbling as fast as
quickly on my advice. The man who
deals In stocks has got to have confidence
and nerve. I've lost a million dollars anJ

made five times that much without losing
my head. As to all my dealings In stocks
I can say that if I had It to do all over
again, knowing what was ahead. I could
not Improve on my stock Investments.
After the big Ophir deal I wanted some
thing to Invest my - money In that I
thought would be safer than banks. I had
spent my boyhood on a farm; had been
In very nearly every kind of . business
since, and I longed to get back to farm

Southern California and called it Santa

It's' right there.
I have invested In all about two million
dollars in Southern California. Some of
the finest horses in the State were raised
on my ranch down there. Next to min

According to the Mayor of Saratoga, Ind.,
I'm the oldest racing man In America.
"When I was in Indiana a year or two ago
he greeted me as such, and,' on my asking
for an explanation, said that fifty years
ago he had been to a race ten miles from
South Bend, at which a horse of mine
won $200.
I recall the race distinctly and believe it
does entitle me to the distinction of beint;
the oldest racing man in America. I was
a lad of about IS at the time and had a
horse that -wasn't much to look at but

No seaport of the United

is at the present moment,
and yet the work is still go

are preparing to mount more
of the disappearing guns,
with their own range-find

the three dynamite guns
concrete foundations are be
ing laid for the first of a se
ries that will constitute a

The old fort at the Point
may be removed and a pow
erful water battery placed
there. Rapid-fire guns will
be mounted on Lime Point,
below and to the west of the
large disappearing rifles on
the top of the cliff.
Angel Island is being for

delivered there will soon be
mounted.
HOW GREAT GUN PROTECT US.
fy AY FRANCISCO is bÂ«ing strongly
foriiSc-d for the reason that it Is
rapidly taking on an importance
L^^ that few other American cities are
4^ likely to assume, vn the Atlantic
coast are innumerable ports of
easy Â«itry connected with all parts of the
country by many lines of railroad. The
loss of any one Eastern city would not
be fatal, but the loss of San Francisco
Â¦would close the Pacific to the United
States On the whole California coast
there Is not another port qualified for the
mobilization and cmbarkment of expedi
tionary forces; added to this the large
miratiT of Government Interests, the
Mint, Subtreaeury. Custom-house, army
headquarters, navy yard, dry docks,
arsenal. quartermasters' warehouse,
femokeless powder works, nitro-glycerin
works end the Union Iron Works' ship
yards, which are largely occupied with
naval construction, make it essential that
Fan Francisco should be protected beyond
th*> possibility of a doubt.
For this reason the iar.d defense* of San
Francisco take on an interest that per
tains to no other port.
The manly art of ep'f -defense is in Its
broader forms one of the first that should
be instilled In the individual. The life
that is not â¢worth protecting is not worth
living, and the life that feels itself but
feebly protected is not half lived.
The national art of eelf-defense is
*-hown and exemplified In its most per
fect type by the new fortifications of San
Franclfro, which lack nothing but com
pletion as planned to make them the equal
Â¦ : any - â¢ ' ai â¢. â¢. Ht^tsl
In the early days of smoky powder and
ehort ra^ge low-power guns it was neces
sary to place thr-m as close as possible
to the narrow passageway between Fort
Point and U.me Point, and even then their
'Â¦fficiency was so small that they fired all
Centennial day at a hulk moored in the
bay and finally had to have It demolished
by a boatman with a giant powder car
tridge to get It out of the way.
The fort as then situated had only an
end-on view of any vessel approaching the
Golden Gate and could only fire upon her
during the very few minute* that she
would occupy in passing It.
The present batferies arÂ« placed outside
of the Golden Gate, where they command
the whole Etretch of baylike indentation
between the Cliff House and Point Bonita,
and an incoming vessel of good epeed is
broadside on to them for half an hour and
In good range.
The location of these runs which con
stitute San Francisco's prlncplal sea coast
defense is In the- midst of scenery more
wild and ruggou than one who is used to
only the gentle slopes of the eastern Â»nd
cf the city can conceive.
Commencing with the three great dyna
mite guns on the crest of the Pr-sidio
range, there is a long line of modern
high-class disappearing cannon, placed
Fide by side as closely as such compli
cated and tremendous engines can be
arranged, and reaching down to where
the cliffs overhang the old brick fort
that sets like a hinge on the southerly
poet of the Golden Gate. Xearly a mile
of Funs couchant, like panthers, resting
on their pedestals and are ready at a
touch to eprinjr yards Into the air. They
overlook the parapet and discharge their
roaring shell. th*n fly back Into conceal
ment to be reloaded In safety by the gun
ners.
In the very brow of the cliff and at the
head of the long line of runs are those
wonderful machines which are the me
chanical eyes and brains of the ci-ouch
lng monsters below. The ran&e finders
are the latest addition of science to the
wisdom of machinery. Eyes they have
that sweep the eea with a keenness out
rivaling that of the eagle. A massive
mechanical brain they have that works
logarithms with the turn of a wheel and
does spherical trigonometry with a lever
and ratchet that merely clicks a few times
and tells you the declination and right
ascension proper for the gun In order to
hit the ship on which the glassy eye of
the monster is fixed. Three tons is the
weight of this silent and Industrious cal
culator. It is mounted on a heavy con
crete base three feet in diameter and con
sists of a giant theodolite, the telescope
of which Is directed toward and kept fixed
upon the vessel whose position it Is de
sired to note. Attached to the. telescope,
and moving not In unison but In syn
chronism with It, Is a duplex panto
srapblc arrangement of levers which mdl
cate exactly the distance and direction of
the object at which the observer Is look
ing. From the range finder there run,
like nerves in underground channels, bun
dles of telegraph, telephone and indicator
wires, and also speaking tubes, to the
gunner at each of the big guns below.
The ranger- finder Is situated in a room
which has its floor about five feet below
the level of the ground. The walls are
of three-foot concrete, with a slit cut out
of one corner which faces kp award and
commands a sweep of 180 degrees. Over
all is a roof of two teei or ooncrete, and
on top of that Is about six feet of earth,
making a sort of bomb-proof mound with
no vulnerable opening but the eyellke
slit that seems as though hidden by Its
drooping concrete lids.
In the fortress of the Presidio of San
Francisco there are on the heights trim,
long, neat looking -guns, so Bllm and
dainty in their Hne3 that they remind you
of the neatly rolled umbrella of a club
man., â¢
la all there are slxteea of these appa-
rently slight and elegant weapons of de
fense fin de slecle located upon their lone
eminence.
There is something; .lonely and dreary
about the long guns up on the cliff that
poke their lean muzzles out over the sea
until their tips are lost in the fog that
rises from. the warm water of the Japan
current, washing the foot of the cliffs be
neath them. They are distant and exclu-
Bive, and each of them occupies as much
room as two dozen guns of similar bore In
the fort oa the water's edge, for dowa
there they are socially lined up ff*e &g%
at a trough, and in the cozy corner* at
the bastions a half dozen of them snuxrl*
together. .
There are already sixteen of the first
class disappearing guns mounted, all of
them over eight Inches In diameter and
capable of throwing projectiles of from
600 to 1000 pounds' weight a distance of
ten miles with a muzzle velocity of 2000
feet per second, and each pun can be load
ed and discharged once every two min
utes, giving from the battery a shot
nearly every ten seconds. In addition to
this is a deck-piercing battery of thirty
or more large mortars of the new breech
loadir.g type and In every way the equal
of the guns for accuracy and rapidity of
fire, except for the rrason that thei
necessartly high trajectory causes their
accuracy to be more affected by wlr.dajro
and elusive travel of the objective target.
On a sixty-acre tract of land lying in
the rear of the Sutro Baths and which
was recently deeded by the city and
county of San Francisco to the Govern
ment of the United States there Is being
erected a new and separate battery which
Is to prevent a hostile vessel from lying
off south of the Cliff House and dropping
fireworks on the roofs of quiet dwellings
and busy stores, as would have been pos
sible at the time that the Spanish war
broke out.
Across the narrows on -J>e top of Lime
Point bluff is a battery of six high-power
modern guns placed at an elevation of
â¢ver 400 feet, which makes it th^ highest
sea coast fcrt in the world and far above
the angle at which any vessel could ele
vate her heavy gur.s. Below, this \nd to
the westward there Is now being em
placed a defensive armament that is a
novelty In shore defense, being entirely
composed of light rapid-fire guns for thÂ»
purpose of sweeping the decks of In
coming hostlles and clearing off any
sharpshooters who ' might attempt to
pick off the gunners and range-finder*
among the cllfftops on shore.
All about the mortar batteries oa the
Presidio heights and around soire of t â¢
rifles there are planted masses of ever
green trees for the purpose of masking
the defenses and preventing gunners on,
the sea from obtaining any definite point
for a target.
The position of a vessel having been
fixed by the range-Cnden, she Is lo
cated as being In a certain one of the
small squared Into which the harbor's
mouth Is arbitrarily divided on the gun
ner's chart. The horizontal anglo to
which the .gun must be turned oa Its
vertical axis and the elevation In degrees
to he given its muzzle in order to gtvÂ«
the projectile the proper trajectory to
land It within that square have already
been figured by the engineer. When the
gunner receives from the range-finder
the number of the square, he turns to his
table, reads off the number of degrees
to which each axi3 of the gun must bÂ»
turned, moves the gun by its .-ydraolic
machinery until each of the Indicators
on the degree circles are at the points
called for in the table, then raises and
fires the gun without having even scea

"Without citing further instances, these
are sufficient to show that the demand for
timber now exceeds the capacity o. t.i^
forest to reproduce it, and danger grows
imminent as each tree is felled without

"Tho passing of the forest means not

far-reaching and Important; it means t^e
destruction of the State through the lo.^

just as tho rain 3 are forest producers, so
the forests are rain producers. An arid

ver, a key-winder of course, and his name
and company were graven within. So
when; in the scramble of retreat, this
watch fell from his pocket, the loss cost
him a pang that for, the moment threw
the battle's loss into shadow.
When it fell to the brown, tramped '
ground he hesitated for a second as to
whether he should stop and look for It
or run t>n with his comrades. The ques
tion was decided for him by those behind,
and he was soon' hustled far from the
spot where he had lost the silver watch.
All that night as Dietz slept orokeuly,
disturbed ever and again by the crack of
a rifle, the thought of his treasure re
curred to his mind. "My, but it seemed
queer to turn in to-night without winding
that faithful old watch," he said to him
self. "Bless it. it never ran down in all
its life before, but I guess It's asleep for

stepped In. While Mr. Dietz was trying
different crystals In my watch, another
customer appeared upon the scene. A
soldier boy he was, short of money, and
desirous to pawn an old sliver key-wind
watch which he carried.
The courteous jeweler explained that
key-wind watches were of no value ex
cept as old silver. He could advance
nothing upon it, he said.
The soldier was urgent. He begged
Dietz to examine the watch more clbstly.
"It is in good condition, even though old
fashioned." he said. "And It's the purest
of silver."
Dietz looked closely, merely out of po
liteness. Suddenly hl 3 expression changed
to one of real Interest. His Hp 3 twitched
in excitement. With the old self-posses
sion he calmed himself and spoke deliber
ately.
"There are several reasons why I should
not advance money on this watch. For
one, I am not a pawnbroker. For an
other, it has no value except as old sli

sell or pawn.' That Is my watch!"

struction of the railroad. The land wVid
then unsalable and money was raided hn
mortgage bonds secured by' it. Afc the
bonds and their interest coupons come due

"Broadly speaking, the forests of the
East are exhausted. The demands upon
them are still increasing and their inaile-
bo dangerous on account of the difficulty
In securing ventilation. To. suppfy this
division of tho Southern Pacific alone it
takes all the wood from 40u0 acres of
timber land each year for locomotive
fuel.
"The railroads are not the only drains
on tho timber, for the mines swallow it
as fast as big gangs of men can place it
in the shafts and drifts; but the homes

expensive tastes and a constant desire
to enlarge and change their houses, really
cause the principal demand on the for

Somehow ihÂ« Hopkins Art Institute
found hire out. The people up there have
a. way of f.r.ding out subjects for picture*.
Their books contain the names of all the
professional models in town, and sketch
clubs and artists apply to them for eub

"We want Manuel." they said.
Po they brought him up before the class,
and the artistic souls fluttered, for he is
the real thing. He did not know how to
stand still rind be looked at for two
hours steadily, but he learned. The 10

for their ecstasy piled up neatly and
helped teach him.
He went to pose dressed in his Sunday
coat, which is long and was black before
tt faded on somebody's else back. But the
class, much to his surprise, scorned thÂ«
coat.
"We want the old blue Jean blouse yon
wore as a stevedore," they said.
So in the blouse h<? posed, his fine old
head bowed with eighty heavy years, his
white hair reaching to the shoulders, his
tiny gold earring naming his race. There

tramps wearily through the streets look

Fays Manuel.

heard these remarks and kept up a very

Then all of a sudden the Petzoldt papa

young lady gone." She had betaken her
self to San Francisco, and from thers
she sent them pretty little filial letters,
faying that she was at work in her chosen

frage was made it was the fashion for
the well-meaning agitators to picture man
as the enemy and oppressor of woman.

that men are not only ready to give
women the privileges they covet but that
men are glad to show women how to use
those privileges. j Â¦.
"From the point of view of the 'prac

satisfactory as lawmakers because they
refuse to be whipped Into line for party

Cheo and Tuo went away together and
Cheo did not weep any more, for Tuo
loved her so well that he could never

THE RESCUE OF CHEO
They took Cheo with them, and into a
strange clean place with odd little white
beds; Cheo fell asleep and felt almost se-
cure, although she was afraid of the
whole world.
After that Cheo brightened up, and was
almost hanny. The ladies of the mission

Then Cheo grew to laugh and was the
first to run and erect the new little
women that were brought Wjeeping to the
mission. The ladies made her pretty.
strange clothes and called her their little
sunbeam. Cheo was happy, but she
thought often of poor Tuo.
One day she told the good lady about
him and the lady asked all about where
he lived. She wrote a long letter and
Cheo went herself with the lady to mall it.
Then she wafted.

By Ernestine Coughran
THIS rice fields of Japan were grow

from her window and the fields were
all around, but Cheo's eyes were full
of tears, and she could see nothing but a
blur. Her lover had been made to go

more; besides they were going to send her
out to America, into a strange land with
pood friend Kaya Han. where she would
tt'.l toy dragons and odd little dolls In
Kaya Han's shop. It was all very
dreamy, and she did not like to think of
Itâ but worst of all they had sent her dear
Tuo Cha away, and he was gone out of
her life forever. True enough he had
-wnlspered to her that he would come some
time where she would be and would take
her away and keep her always, but It
could not be true. They would send her
to San Francisco where there were no rice

ca close and roared all the time, and how
would dear Tuo ever find her?
Po little Cheo cried and cried until her

Fhe would soon forget Tuo and that good
friend Kaya Han would sure'.y take good
care, of her out in San Francisco, and

Cheo did not cease to grieve, though her

were all packed up and tt was time to say
rood -by.
"I shall never, never come back again,"

Cheo's country crawled away Into a blue

ARE TEARFUL WOMEN TYRANTS?
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that
there were two powers that operated both
physical and social affairsâ wind power
and water power. Men. I suppose, may
be said to use the former when they
swear, and women the latter when they
cry. Tears are a confession of weakness,
and yet women are never fo strong a3
when they use them. A woman's tears are
generally an evidence that she. has tho
wrong side of the argument, and yet they
are invariably the sign of her triumph.
Tears are a last resort when everything
else fails, like a cavalry reserve In time,
of battle. A man may boast as much as
he pleases about his steadfastness and
iron will, but when he faces a tearful
woman he yields as readily as did Corio.
lanus. His innate chivalry makes his
submission a sure thing.
There is no remedy for it. Man might
as well yield gracefully first as 'last. Tho
defiant weakness which a woman Â«howa
by crying is irresistible, and she knows it.
It is the water power that grinds a man
down to her conception of what a good
husband ought to be.
Now crying is the prerogative of a wo
mun, and she will never relinquish it. She
is a Lorn strategist, and knows how to
gain her ends. Napoleon said that ho
ruled France, his wife ruled him, and
that the baby ruled his wife.

The general editor is Dr. William T. Har
ris, who has written an Introduction, pre
fixed to every one of the series.
The general preface is a piece of solemn
nonsense and error, which prejudices the
reader against the bonks to which it is in

it is a matter of more importance to gtt
the right kind of a book than to gi;t a

work in his offii Lai position has been use

of Prance, when t lie whole strength of the
republic was turned to the protection of
the country from invasion. M. Gras' fer
tility in the invention of incident is so
grent a:* to make applicable the old pro
vt-rb which Dryden quotes about Chaucer,
"Here is God's plenty." His unfailing ex
uberance produces the. impression that he
stops because he feels like it, and thinks
It proper, and that he could go on for
ever. The narrative is written with a
genial appcarunce of artlessnesa, moving

Holden's "Children cf the Sun" are nota

in them. Dr. Weed's "The Insect World"
consist* of a lar^e number of short
selected articles t*y American entomolo

generalization or exposition of the broad
facts Â«.f Insect life, the bulk of the book
consisting of liCe histories of various In
sects. Th result is not satisfactory, for
the extrcm* condensation of the Intro

STATUS OF SCHOOL FUNDS.
Auditor Advises Board of Education
as to Its Powers.
A communication was recently sent to
Auditor "Wells by C. W. Mark, president
of the Board of Education, asking for cer
tain information regarding the school
funds under the regime of the old board.
The Auditor replied yesterday through
his chief deputy, "W. W. WeHd. as fol
lows:
"The amount of school funds available
from January 1 to June 30, 1300. is $600,000.
as per the appropriation of the tax levy
of the present year. There is a surplus
of $10,90 l i*S left over from the appropria
tion for the first six months of the hscal
year, making a total of $Â»J10.951 OS available
for the next six months. This shows con
clusively that the last Board of Educa
tion held strictly within the limits of its
apportionment.
â¢"The present Board of Education ha 3
control of the entire city apportionment
of the State school funds recently sent to
the City Treasurer, which amounted to
$300,000. but as the settlements with the
State are made only semi-annually it Is
customary for the Treasurer to borrow
from the sinking fund and the rebata
funa, and part of the tiOO.wO so borrowed
has been returned to those funds. Ac
cording to the balances in the various
funds at 12 o'clock noon. January 8. 1900,
shows the School Department balance to
be $72.007 95.
"Under this showing "the present Board

quences of delivering San Francisco
over to the claws of. its Burns and
Gunst and all they represent.
The Commissioners know the serious
import of their actions. When Gunst
was a Police Commissioner he wanted
more power than he then possessed.
He wanted a wide-open town, with its
influx of preying human harpies. He
wanted gambling dens in full blast, for
it meanta money to him and the dread
ful harvest of shame, disgrace, misery
and death which the people of the city
would inevitably reap was no concern
of his. Will the Police Commissioners
now place his protege at the head of
the Police Department, clothe him with
the tremendous powers of his office
and give to his master that evil sway
for which he has sought so persistently?
The answer will be given in the vote of
the I commission on Tuesday night.
Charges have been preferred against
the appointment of Frederick L. Esola
to the position of Chief of Police and
will be read at that time.
MORSE WAS ROBBED BY
JULES J. CALLUNDAN
FORCED NOW TO COME TO HIS
ASSISTANCE.
In a Letter to the Police Commission
the Detective Denies The
Call's Charges.
The following communication was filed
yesterday with the Police Commission:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 13, 1900.
To the Honorable Board of Police
Commissionersâ Gentlemen: I respect
fully call your attention to an article
â¢ published In The Call of this date, det
rimental to the good name of Jules J.
Callundan, late In my employ and now
Â¦ a member of .the;San*l?rancisco Police
Department, wherein Mr. Callundan 13
charged with being "a thief, defaulter
and once a fugitive from Justice." Mr.
J. J. Callundan has never been in the
-employ of any person for the last
eighteen years except mine. During all
that time he has been an honest, faith
ful employe. He never at any time em
bezzled from me; on the contrary, he
has honestly and faithfully cared for
my Interests.
If Mr. Callundan Is as The Call des
ignates him "a thief, defaulter and one
time fugitive from justice," then Mr.
Callundan is an unlit person to be In
the position of policeman In the de-
Eartment of the city and county of
an Francisco. Therefore, as I was
one of the signers of Mr. Callundan's
petition asking for his appointment on
the police force, I most respectfully
request your honorable body to cause
an Investigation to be made of The
Call's charges that the truth or falsity
of said charges may be ascertained.
Yours respectfully.
HARRY N. MORSE.
As abova Â«et forth The Call did state
yesterday that Jules J. Callundan. for
merly la ftae employ of Mr. Morse, now a
member of the San Francisco Police De
partment, was "a thief, a defaulter and
a fugutlve from Justice."
The Call takes advantage of to-day's
issue to reiterate that charge and to add
for the benefit of Mr. Morse and the many
others directly Interested, that the man
whom Jules J. Callundan robbed was
Harry N. Morse.
The people "of Sari Francisco " have
been patient with their police adminis
istration. They have endured its evils
and submitted without protest to the
daily illustration of its inadequacies.
They hoped for a change that would
be for the better â not for the worse.
They expected that. with the operation
of the charter government would come
a reorganization of the Police Depart
ment upon a plane of honesty and ef
ficiency. The people. did not expect
that instead of cleansing the city of its
plague spots the new Commissioners
would fasten upon San Francisco for
years a horde of human parasites.
The people of San Francisco hoped
to see the new administration destroy
the lawlessness of Chinatown and not
make it a vehicle for blackmail profit
and bribery. It was hoped that the
blatant sounds, insulting signs, gross
snares and revolting vice of dives would
be removed from our public thor
oughfares and not be legalized
for official gain. It was hoped that the
petty criminals and social outcasts that
infest the'. great streets,* the gamblers,
touts, thieves, bunko steerers and crim
inals would be driven into their holes
or but of the city, and not given police
protection to ply their trade.
But the Commissioners are pledged
to do otherwise. In the election of
Esola, alias Harrington, as Chief of Po
lice/ and the appointment of Callun
dan, alias Worthington, as chief of dc^
tectives, the Police Commissioners have
pledged themselves to betray the city
and: leave its citizens at the mercy of
the lawless. The personality of Esola
and of Callundan is a matter of small
concern in 1 an affair of this magnitude..
It is not what they are or were; it is
what they represent. f
It -is certainly not a matter for con
gratulation that a Police Commission,
asking the respect of the people of. this
city, should award the two greatest gifts
in its power to. two men with aliases.
It" would seem that men who have not
found it convenient to change their
names' might be. chosen. It certainly
is not â¢ pleasant to look forward to . a
chief of 'detectives .who has been a de
faulter and a fugitive, but whatever
these men arc they play only the part
of tools in the outrageous scheme which
involves their election.
They represent all that is vicious in
the community and all the dangerous
elements 'that may be imported to it.
They represent the impurities of the so
cial body, the gamblers, thieves, dive
keepers and outcasts. In order to de
stroy the effect of the just arraignment
which has been made of this proposed
reorganization it is said that Esola will
sacrifice Callundan and appoint some
one else. The Police Commissioners
know "Callundan. Have they any as
surance or can they give any that Eso
la's.second choice will not be v worse
than the first? He has indicated his
policy and shown his methods. Both
are in the highest degree detrimental
to the interests of San Francisco.
The ' Commissioners certainly cannot
misunderstand their position. Their
duty to themselves and to the public,
which they, represent in a vitally im
portant -relation, is perfectly -plain.
Â¦They cannot, without inflictinjr the
most serious injury upon' San Francis-
the p'eople- : - : -wf cannot tf?dnti*~that
paper too much.
"No nezvspaper can hurt a man
badly except by telling something to
his personal discredit and furnish
ing the proof.
"Everybody knows, and especial
ly every man sitting at this table,
that no man was committed to any
thing when he was appointed. The
Fire Department and the Police
Cojnmission were asked to give only
a zngorous and an honest adminis
tration. Â¦ The Police Department
was asked to renovate the depart
ment thoroughly, because for the
last forty years it has been a place
zvhere you and I could not get per
fect justice. The commission zvas
asked to renovate it because for the
last forty years it has been filled
with certain zvell-known scandals.
That- zvas all.
"This is really a revolution and
I merely asked all â¢ these " men to
stand up to their zvork and thereby
subject themselves to abuse. For
my part I dm willing to take my
share of it.
"The Mayor enjoys this great
privilege under the charter â that if.
anything goes wrong he can rem
edy it. He can remove a Chief of.
Police for cause, so I am afraid of
nothing that can happen.
"Nozv I call upon a gentleman
who knows zvhereof he speaks to
respond to 'The Police,' but I don't
know that he has anything to say.
I have the honor to introduce- Mr:
George A. Nczvhall."â(Mr. Nczv
hall's speech at the banquet zvill be
found on Page- if.)
The people of San Francisco are now
thoroughly aroused to a sense of the
danger that threatens them in the pro
posed reorganization of the Police De
partment with F. L. Esola, alias Har
rington, as Chief of Police, and J. J.
Callundan, alias Worthington, as chief
of detectives. The contemplated' out
rage, planned and perfected by Mayor
Phelan, was the topic yesterday of uni
versal comment and discussion. Men
could not fairly realize that four citi
zens occupying the standing and enjoy
ing the reputations of the members of
the Police Commission could be in
duced to barter away their honor, sink
themselves to the level of fellowship
with criminal elements and sacrifice the
people of the city to a predatory popu
lation. Reputable citizens, who see in
the proposed plot a tremendous scheme
to harass them and irreparably injure
the city,, could not how any
pledge to, a politician could force, the
Commissioners into an act that they
know perfectly would stamp them with
shame. : >
may feel as the consequences of
his outrageous bargain. He has
felt the sting of rebuke, but the
contract was made and he was
forced to submit. With his pri
vate character or ideals The Call
is not concerned, but when he
assumes as he did last night to
say that in this community he
shall be the sole and supreme ar
biter of right and wrong, that he,
in his wisdom, shall appoint
whom he pleases and force the
people of this city to endure the
consequences of his act until he
changes his mind, then the time
has come to voice a protest that
must be heard.
What is there in the life of
Mayor Phelan that gives him the
right to dictate the morals, guide
the homes or judge the protec
tion that shall be given to the
families of this city? Men of rep
utation, men of affairs, of busi
ness and of family are protesting
against the outrage that will
make of the Police Department
a machine of immorality and a
They are fighting for the sanc
tity of their homes. They are
guarding the children who bear
their names. Does Mayor Phe
lan understand their position?
Cannot he see that there is some
thing more sacred, more vital
than the giving of a political job
in the prostitution of an institu
tion that may become appalling
in its influence for evil?
If he cannot, then his. Police
Commissioners should. do so for
him. They owe a solemn duty to
the people of San Francisco not
to place th^m at the mercy of the
horde that Mayor Phelan by
contract has commanded shall
invade the City Hall. These
Commissioners owe it to them
selves, to their families and to
the people they represent to
break the dishonest bond which
will give San Francisco over to
its social scum. They have as
much moral right to invite to
their firesides a libertine, a thief
and a defaulter as they have to
give a libertine or a defaulter the
official power to enter any ether
home in this city.
It is a serious issue and must
have serious consequences. If
POLICE COMMISSIONERS AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS.
Mayor Phelan be" convinced still
that a newspaper can hurt a man
badly by telling the truth, he
ought to feel the sting of injury
and the shame of unworthy con
duct.
His remarkable address was
delivered last night at the ban
quet given to the new officials of
the charter government, and was
as follows:
"Gentlemen, the Police Depart
ment seems to be exciting a good
deal of interest of late in the
public mind, and for that reason I
intend nozv' to call upon a member
of the commission to give you a fezv
facts, if he cares to express himself,
that you may like to hear.
"The newspapers have under
taken to think for the Police Com
mission and tell it what to do, as
zvcll as to think for the Mayor and
dictate his policy. In view of the
fact that for the last two or three
weeks they have spent the time fight
ing one another and saying all the
unpleasant things about their con
temporaries they could think ofâ
not to mention the zvay they have of
exposing their inside methods in
these fights â th-ey have furnished a
good deal of amusement by this at
tempted dictation.
"The power of the press is insig
nificant, so far as anything politi
cal is concerned, and their, impor
tance is high only in. billingsgate.
In that line they exceed all others:
1 "There zvas a man actually
placed, in a position under the new
charter the other day zvho was a
newspaper man, and that is the only
good augury for the profession I
have seen. . \
"The newspapers are more im
portant than zve only in libel. I
would like to have the blackguardly
gentlemen who preside over the
nezvspapers here where zve could
speak to them personally, but they
skulk azvay and sit in high towers,
where zve cannot get at them.
"There is only one paper in the
city that has been the' friend of the
charter. It has furnished support
in every instance and has given us
the freedom of its columns to make
this fight, and while zve have been
obliged to supplement the support
thus, given by hiring public halls
and delivering speeches â which is
really the best zvay of getting at

district last evening. Throughout the
alleys In Chinatown the doors of the
gambling houses were wide open and tha
wily lookout made himself conspicuous
by hla absence. Extra policemen In citi
zens' attlro were scattered throughout
the district, but their work became mon
otonous to them, so quiet has the Chinese
quarters become as a result of the re
cent raids of Acting Chief of Police Biggy.
Late yesterday afternoon the acting
Chief was served with an injunction Is
sued by Circuit Judsa Morrow, restrain
ing him from interfering with the Inmates
of Bacon place and ordering him to with
draw the blockade on tho street.
The injunction was served after court
had adjourned and had the effect of tying
the hands of Chief Blggy until the con
vening of court on Monday morning. Of
ficers were left at the head of the
thoroughfare, however, to preserve tho
peace.
About 10 o'clock last night Mr. Blsrgy.
accompanied by Police Captain Wittman,
went to the Nymphia Hotel, where a
squad of police officers were stationed
warning people not to enter the' premises
as a raid might be made at any moment.
As the acting chief and the captain were
about to enter from the street Attorney
Plstolesi served Mr. Biggy with an in
junction similar to the one served in the
Bacon place case and signed by Judge
Murasky.
Immediately after service Mr. Biggy
had Captain Wittman send for more otti
cers to be placed on the sidewalk near
the hotel.
Wittman's orders to his men were very
plain and to the point. Instructing them
to preserve the peace of the public street,
not to enter the private property nor to
Interfere with any one going in or out.
or to Intimidate any one entering the
premises, but to act only as peace omcer3.
The men were lined up near the entrance,
far enough apart to leave sufficient pas
sageway for traffic.
Acting Chief Biggy has declared himself
against the sure-thing men and bunko
steerers. and will give them ten days to
leave the city under penalty of being ar
rested for vagrancy. The parasites who
are living on the earnings of fallen
women will be looked after during the
coming week, and Mr. Blggy will try to
rid the city of their unwelcome presence.
MAYOR PHELAN DETERMINED TO HONOR HIS DISHONEST BOND
He Announces at a Pub
lic Banquet That He
Will Conduct Police
Affairs toSuitHimself.
Criticism Defied, and the
People of the City Com
manded to Accept Without
Protest the Absolute Dicta
tion of the Mayor in Affairs
That Affect Them ' Most
Deeply.
JAMES D. PHELAN,
Mayor of this city, seized
last night the first oppor
tunity which he considered pro
pitious to attempt a justification
of his betrayal of San Francisco
into the hands of its criminals.
He sought in the genial warmth
of wine to palliate his offense in
bartering the Police Department
and all it represents for the in
fluences which will advance his
political ambition. He pleaded
with subterfuge, misrepresenta
tion and deliberate falsehood to
cover his trail among designing
politicians in a corrupt cam
paign. He denied that he had
pledged the Police Commission
to vote for any one for Chief of
Police and he sneered at the au
dacity of any newspaper to criti
cize or dictate his policy. He
declared that the newspapers
have power only to libel and he
dared their "presiding black
guards" to come from their high
towers where he can get at them.
*'Xo newspaper can hurt a
man badly," he said, "except by
idling something to his personal
discredit and fumishinsr the
proof.*' Assuming- that Mayor
Phelan understands the meaning
of personal discredit and a proof
The Call deals with his remark.
The Call has said and now re
peats that during the recent cam
paign and before election Mayor
Phelan made a corrupt bargain
to deliver the Police Department
of this city into corrupt hands.
This compact between an ambi
tious officeseeker and corrup
tionists, The Call repeats, in
volved the election of F. L. Esola,
alias Harrington, as Chief of Po
lice.
The Call charges that Mayor
Phelan deliberately placed the
tremendous police power of this
city in the hands of men who
would be, he thought, valuable
to him in aiding his private, per
sonal and selfish ends. The Call
charges that he prostituted his
high office and his power, placed
the families and the homes of this
city at the mercy of blacklegs,
blackmailers and social pariahs
that he might gain an influence
that meant votes.
These are serious allegations.
If Mayor Phelan believes that
they reflect any personal dis
credit upon him he knows the re
course open to every citizen. He
knows where he may obtain re
dress and The Call defies him to
attempt to seek it. If a news
paper have power only to libel he
knows the penalty and if he seeks
a proof of the charges he knows
where it can be brought forth.
The Call charges that in obedi
ence to his dishonest compact to
make of the Police Department
an engine of vice and oppression
and blackmail, he did not dare
name any but the men selected
for him as Police Commission
ers. He had no choice after he
had sealed his own dishonor and
betrayed the people of this city
to a horde of outcasts that with
official station and official pro
tection will take upon themselves
dreaded power to harm. This is
neither abuse nor libel. It is the

NAME O F THE
WRECKED SHIP
YET UNKNOWN
Bodies of Lost Seamen
Strewn Along the Beach
of St. Marys Bay.
VESSEL BREAKING UP
All Hope That Any of Those
Aboard Survived the Disaster
Has Been Abandoned.
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. Jan. 11â The name
of the wrecked vessel In St. Marys
Bay Is atlll unknown. The weather
continues rough to-day, and the
fisher folk were unable to board her.
She Is almost wholly submerged and her
hull is badly battered. At present the
seas are breaking over the ship and run
ning mountain high against the rocks.
Much wreckage Is strewn along the strand
and many bodies, some of them dismem
bered, are visible. Portions of the boats
remain hooked to the blocks, and this is
believed to indicate that the boats were
swamped in lowering and that their crews
perished. Most of the bodies are only half
clothed.
The wind Is now oft the land and the
wreckage is not coming ashore. Therefore
no further knowledge can be gained re
garding the ship's cargo or her passengers
if she carried any.
A watch has been maintained along the
cliff ever since the people got there, and
fire 3 are kept burning at night and flags
waving by day as a signal to any boat's
crew which may have escaped. It Is not
considered likely, however, that any suc
ceeded in getting away from the wreck.
Derricks were erected to-day at likely
points to lower men to-morrow to recover
bodies' washed up. and if possible to dis
cover the name of the vessel from the
wreckage. Divers will be sent from here
If it be found impossible to obtain the
steamer's name by other means.
The racovery and burial of the bodies of
the ship's company have been ordered by
the Marine Department. The cruiser Fio
nana. from Fortune Bay. should reach the
scene of the wreck to-morrow. No re
ports have been received from any local
ity whither wreckage or boats might be
expected to drift.
The French company's repairing steam
er Francois Arogo, which it was fearci
might prove to be the vessel wrecked and
burning in St. Marys Bay. has arrived
here, fourteen days from Havre, via
Cherbourg. She met stormy weather and
is short cf coal. She will remain here un
til tine weather sets in, when she will go
to repair the cable fifty miles southeast of
St. Johns.
Another steamer In distress is Just en
tering the port.
As the result of interviews by the cor
respondent of the Associated Press with
a number of shipmasters, the conclusion
is reached that the wreck is a freight or
passenger vessel from some port in thÂ«Â»
United States, which had been trying to
make Cape Race^ in order to get a depart
ure point for the voyage across the At
lantic. - fst'

PARIS. Jan. 13.â Dr. Springer recently
read a paper before the Academy of Medi
cine about his Investigations to promote
the growth of children, youths or even
persons who are apparently fully grown.
He has found electricity valuable. Treat
ment by electricity of the cartilage of
the knees Increased functional activity so
materially that in every case, save where
ossification of the cartilages was com
plete, a marked Increase of growth had
been the result.
One instance was that of a Toung con
script, who within a few weeks attained
the neight limit requisite to secure his en
rollment, although Dr. Springer had little
hope of success when he began his experi
ments.

SITUATION SERIOUS,
Blood May Be Shed Should Taylor Be
Unseated..
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 13.â The situa
tion In the contests for Governor and the
State offices and the question of what la
Â£oir.g to happen when the final result is
declared ars to-night fruitful of the most
extravagant speculation. If the adherents
of the contestees. the Republican incum
bents of the State offices, carry out the
line of procedure they now threaten by
refusing tt wcat*. even in case the Leg
islature decides in favor of the Demo
cratic contestants, the situation will be
serious: and if the statements of some cf
the men h'.eh !n the councils of the State
are to be credited, this is what they pro
pose to do.
K. J. Hampton, secretary of the Repub
lican State Central Committee, predicted
to-n!jrht that several thousand anti-Goeb*!
men from all parts cf the State would be
here to protest by their cresence aguinst
unseating Taylor and Marshall, and to
sustain them If the Legislature votes to
turn them out. He denied that any of
those here now were soldiers in citizens'
clothing, as charged by the Goebel Demo
crats.

DENVER POST SHOT
Result of a Quarrel
With a Lawyer.;
BONFILS' CONDITION CRITICAL
Attorney Anderson, Who Did the
Shooting, Claims He Was At
tacked and Fired in
Self-Defense.
DENVER, Jan. 13.â 8. H. Tammen and I
Frederick G. Bonflls. proprietors of the
Denver Post, were shot In the office of j
that newspaper at noon to-day by W. W. j
Anderson, an attorney. Both are severely
wounded.
Anderson fired five shots. Two of them
are said to have wounded Bonflls, one in
the side and the other in the arm. Tam
men was shot in the shoulder, the bullet
going into his breast.
Both were able to walk to carriages
that carried them home. After the
shooting Anderson walked out of the
office unmolested, but was later arrested.
He refused to talk when seen at the
police station, but the bruises on his face
showed that he had received rough
handling. It Is understood that Tammen
and Bonflla were attempting to eject him
from their office, when he began shoot
ing. As he was leaving the PostoÃlce
the lawyer said that Bonflls and Tammci
both attacked him and that he used hla
revolver in self-defense.
Tammen and Bonflls say that Anderson
walked into their office and began shcol
lng without more ado.
"He shot Bonflls and then came after
me" saici Tammen. "He followed me up
and hemmed me in In one of the corners.
Polly Pry jumped in front of me and tried
to shield me. She saved me from being
killed, ajthough she could not protect me
from being shot."
It is learned that the publishers and the
lawyer quarreled in regard to a fee which
Anderson had received from Packer,
known as "The Cannibal." who is serving
a term in prison for murder, and for
whom the Post has been endeavoring to
obtain a pardon.
B. H. Tammen has been associated with
Frederick Bonfils. formerly of Kansas
City, in the publication of the Post since
lsSo. Mr. Tammen was the founder of
the Great Divide, a monthly magazine,
the publication of whicn was begun in
this city but which was subsequently re
moved to Chicago. He Is the proprietor
of one of the leading curio stores of the
West.
John F. Carroll, managing editor of the
Post, made the following statement in
regard to the causes leading up to the
affray:
"The Packer case was at the bottom of
the difficulty. Anderson, who was Pack
er's attorney, believed that he could
open the case again on the grounds that
Packer had been convicted in a State
court, whereas his crime had been com
mitted on a Government reservation, and
that, consequently, he should have been
held for trial by the United States author
ities. The Post agreed to help him to re
open the case on these grounds If he
would consent to let I. N. Stevens, the
Post's attorney, direct the case. To this
Anderson agreed.
"Polly Pry visited Packer and discov
ered that Anderson had secured $25 from
him to be used in the prosecution of the
case. Anderson represented that he was
one of the directors of the Post, and as
the Post has championed his cause.
Packer turned over the money.
"Later Packer revoked Anderson's au
thority to act as attorney for him. An
derson's actions naturally Incensed Mr.
Tammen and Mr. Bonflls and they sent
for Anderson. They charged him with
the false representations he had made
and a quarrel ensued."
Both the wounded publishers are rest-
Ing comfortably to-day. Mr. Tammen'a
injuries, though painful, are not danger
ous. Mr. Bonflls' condition is critical, one
bullet having lodged in the neck in the
region of the great blood vessels and
nerves.

BALFOURS WORDS
VERY OFFENSIVE
Freely Criticized by Ail
Parties. ...
MAY DISRUPT ;THE CABINET
Flan of Creating a Large Volunteer
Army Sufficient for Home De
fense Advocated by the
British Press.
Copyrighted, 1500, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Jan. 13.â The frivolity dis
played In his recent speeches by Mr. Bal
four. the Government leader in the House
of Commons, has landed what has been
known as the strongest Government of
modern times In the slough, from which
extrication Is difficult, if not doubtful.
Kls light-hearted remarks, which were
pleasantly accepted by the nation when
times were good and ail was well, are of
fensive to a people mourning for lost sons
and deeply angered by the unprecedented
reverses. Mr. Balfour. if he had tried,
could not have more successfully put his
countrymen on edge, and when Lord
Salisbury speaks he will have much to
atone for. The memory of Mr. Chamber
lain's "alliance" speech was dying away
before Mr. Balfour put his foot still deep
er In the mire.
The Conservatives hope that Mr. Bal
four will follow Mr. Chamberlain's exam
ple and keep a discreet silence. As the
Saturday Review, one of the Govern
ment's star.chest supporters puts it:
"The administration is now face to face,
not with the opposition, but with the no
tion." It is a crisis out of which several
must come with reputations smirched, and
may possibly result in the wreck of the
Government. In any case a reconstruc
tion cf the Cabinet seems inevitable.
The Spectator protests against making
Mr. Balfour the scapegoat, and declares
that though Lord Salisbury is still the
wisest mind in the empire, it is Impossible
for him to continue much longer both as
Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. It
advocates his retention at the head of the
Foreign Office and the appointment cf Mr.
Balfour as Premier, the Marquis of Lans
dowr.e being succeeded at the- War Office
by H. Arnold Forester. The same paper,
gravely reviewing the serious military
condltion of the country, advocates an
elaborate plan for home defense, includ
ing a volunteer army recruited from civil
ians and former soldiers, which would not
actually be called out except in case at In
vasion." but which would form a nucleus
to enable the standing army to be sent
abroad without qualms.
"If we are to escape conscription, says
the Outlook, "the public mu?t be edu
cated to take a more serious discrimina
tion and self-sacrificing interest in the
army."
In the meanwhile, so the Associated
Press learns. Lord Salisbury does not
mean to be inactive. He believes the
salvation cf Great Britain"? military sys
tem depends upon General Lord Kitchen
er, la whom he has long had implicit faith.
It has already been planned that if Lords
Roberts and Kitchener bring the cam
paign to a successful termination the lat
ter will be brought home to honors al
most equal to those of the Duke of Wel
lington. He will be put into the War Of
fice and will be given a free hand to brush
away the cobwebs which clog the Brit
ish army. Lord Roberts of course will
not be neglected; but then he would be
too old for such work as is outlined for
Lord Kitchener. Perhaps before this can
be accomplished Lord Salisbury will be
out of power and Lord Kitchener will be
discredited, but upon such rehabilitation
by means- of a young and brilliant agent
has the heart of the British Premier been
set. It remains to be seen whether fate
will enable him to carry it out. â¢
The extremist view is well voiced in a
public letter written by Henry Broad
hurst (Liberal Labor*, member of Parlia
ment for Leicester, formerly secretary of
the Parliamentary Committee of the
Trades Union Congress, in which he says:
â¢"The amazing confession of ignorance.
Incapacity and almost indifference made
by Mr. Balfour makes the stoutest hearts
feel that in the hands of the present Gov
ernment the safety of the empire is not
worth six months' purchase.
'"Mr Ba'.four's statement that threearmy
corps were placed in the field without a
hitch has given the critics arf excellent
and not wasted opportunity of pointing
out that though enough individuals to
make up three corps are on their way to
South Africa they only have the artillery
requisite, according to the British regu
lations, for one corps, while In cavalry
and army service components they are al
most equally deficient, proving the very
lack of organization so frequently laid
at the door of the War Office."
Advices to tlie Associated Press from
Liberia Indicate that Germany is emulat
ing France in her endeavor to g Tab ter
ritory and Is working strenuously to per
suade or coerce Liberia into accepting: a
German protectorate. The latest attempt
has taken the form of a demand by Herr
Humplemeyer, the German Consul at
Monrovia, who has Just returned from a
visit to Berlin for immediate reparation
for the alleged maltreatment of a German
subject in IS??. The case is that of a Ger
man planter named Koch, who, refusing
to obey a civil summons waa taken to
the court by force. He claimed damages,
the matter waÂ«" taken up in Berlin, has
since been pending between the two Gov
ernments, and though not settled by the
Liberian courts Herr Humplemeyer
threatens to take severe measures unless
Heir Koch's claims are paid. The Libe
rian officials fully believe that both
France and Germany wish to take advan
tage of Great Britain's war to force them
to accept a protectorate. The little re
public is shut off from cable communica
tion from th<? rest of the world and is
anxious to learn the feeling existing at
Washington toward it, as there is a grow
ing sentiment toward requesting an
American or British protectorate in or
der to put an end to the harassing de
mands. Such is the Koch case, and the
French encroachments has been referred
to In previous dispatches.
Edward Blake, Nationalist member of
Parliament for South Langford, formerly
Chancellor of Upper Canada, has been
epeakinff very plainly on the subject of
the rumors that members of certain Irish
societies contemplated an Invasion of
Canada. He eald to the people of Lang
ford that if he believed It was true he
would have borrowed a Mauser, have
learned the new rifle practice and have
taken naÃÃase to Canada to "help defend
my wire, children and grandchildren from
my brother home rulers."
The former Canadian leader has no
sympathy with thÂ« more advanced Bection
of his party.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ADVEBTISEMENTS.Louis Rosenkranz, who Is employed with "W. "W. Montague & Co.,
â¢was interviewed by â¢ a reporter at his residence. SB7 Harriet street,
and he could not say enough In praise of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
His constant bending over in his work brought on a serious condition of
the kidneys, besides rheumatic attacks, which incapacitated him from
work. He had lost so many days and consequent wages that his wife, after
much persuasion, induced him to take Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, which
she had occasionally used with satisfactory results. The story of his ex-
perience is best told in his own words:
"I was beginning to feel very much discouraged," said Mr. Rosenkranz.
"The pains in my back were terrific, and I began to feel the symptoms of
that dread disease, rheumatism. It became very monotonous to be obliged
to go to bed every once in a while for a few days and then only get a tem-
porary relief from the doctors I called in. My wife began to lose patience
with me because debts began to pile up against my little household, and she
finally persuaded me to give Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root a trial at least. I
did so, and I have used four bottles, with surprisingly good results. The
pains have entirely left me, and I can safely say that I have now not a
particle of kidney trouble, all on account of using the Swamp-Root, which
I was at first Inclined to deride. It has proved a godsend to my family and
myself." ,>Vt ,
Mrs. Rosenkranz was an attentive listener to her husband's favorable
opinions of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, and when he had finished his com-
plimentary observations she added her meed of praise to the curative prop-
erties of the Swamp Root."
"I have always kept a bottle of the Swamp-Root In the house," she said,
"and It has never failed me In the hour of necessity. I must relate one par-
ticular Instance of Its beneficial effects among a great many others. A
few days ago I was taken with frightful pains in the stomach after eat-
ing some radishes. The pains became most excruciating, and they presently
commenced to shoot through every member of my body, and I thought I
would go crazy. In my agony I completely forgot the presence of a bottle
of Swamp-Root in the house, and my husband was "about to go for a doc-
tor when I happened to think of it. I made known that I wanted my favor-
ite medicine, and my husband gave me a double dose. After an hour, dur-
ing which the pains gradually subsided, I passed off into peaceful slumber,
and in the morning, when the medicine had acted. I was able to go about
my household duties, though naturally I felt very weak from the terrible
experience of the night before. I took the Swamp-Root for several days,
and since then I have felt perfectly well. I can safely recommend the
Swamp-Root for the .maladies to which everybody is subject, and I am
a witness to the wonderful results obtained In the case' of my husband."

Louis Rosenkfanz Gives High Praise to Dr. Kilmer's
World-Famous Swamp-Root.

Special Dispatch to The Call
OMAHA. Jan. 13.â Omaha's new wo
man has asserted her divine right to pose
as the head of a family. While she was
not mannish in any particular. It was ap
parent that she was full of business and
had a mind of her own. This was the
opinion formed by the lawyers and spec
tators when they observed Miss Llla A.
Clark of South Omaha walk into the of
fice of the County Judge this morning
and ask for the clerk whose duty it is
to Issue marriage licenses. Being directed
to his desk. Miss Clark, with as much
unconcern as though she was about to
buy a dress pattern, requested the issu
ance of a marriage license, authorizing
her marriage with Gustave A. Johnson
of South Omaha. She answered all the
questions, subscribed to the required
oath, paid over the fee and with the doc
ument giving her permission to wed tuck
ed away In a handbag, swept out of the
office as Indifferent as when she entered.
The young woman who transacted this
bit of business, usually looked after by
the man In the case, explained that it
was not convenient for the groom to visit
the County Judge's clerk, and that In or
der to have the wedding come off accord
ing to programme she had decided to look
after the business herself. She was
garbed in a neat fitting tailor-made suit
and on her head sat a light colored Fe
dora, Under this hat there was a smiling
face that caused a number of the bache
lors about the room to envy Mr. Johnson.
Blaney Is 77 years of age, and his eye
is as clear and his hand as steady as a
man twenty years younger, and he as-
cribes his present good condition to
the use of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root.
Here is what he says about his ex-
perience in the use of the medicine:
"Some years ago I w,as taken with a
weakness of the bladder and pains in
the back, which ran down my right leg
and were excruciating in their Inten-
sity. I consulted doctor after doctor
and took prescription after prescrip-
tion, but I kept getting worse instead
of better. In a moment of disgust one
Tried It as a Last Resort-
Better Than He Has Been
for a Decade.
John Blaney, a retired capitalist, re-
siding at 2721 Sacramento street, was
averse to having his name in print, but
when asked what Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root had done for him he became en-
thusiastic in his praises of the medi-
cine and launched forth In a torrent of
favorable comment regarding it. Mr.
How to Find Out if You Have
Kidney Trouble and Need
Swamp-Root.
It used to be considered that
only urinary and bladder troubles
were to be traced to the kidneys,
but now modern science proves
that nearly all diseases have .their
beginning in' the disorder of
these most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify
the blood â that is their work.
So when your kidneys are sick
you can understand how quickly
your entire body is affected and
how every organ seems to fail to
do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly,"
begin taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, because as soon as
your kidneys are well they will
help all the other organs to health.
Kidney trouble is responsible
for more different kinds of trou-
ble and suffering than any other
disease. Kidney trouble irritates
the nerves, makes you dizzy, rest-
less, sleepless and irritable.
Causes rheumatism and neural-
gia; pain or dull ache in the back,
joints and muscles, makes your
head ache and back ache, causes
indigestion, stomach and liver
trouble; you get a sallow, yellow
complexion; makes you feel as
though you had heart trouble;
you have plenty of ambition, but
no strength, get weak and waste
away.
The cure for these troubles is
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the
world-famous kidney remedy.
In taking Swamp-Root you af-
ford natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect
healer and gentle aid to the kid-
neys that is known to medical
science.
If: there is any doubt in your
mind as to your condition, take
from your urine on rising about
two ounces, place it in a glass or
bottle and let it stand twenty-
four hours. If, on examination,
it is milky or cloudy, if there is
brick dust settling, or if small par-
ticles float about in it, your kid-
neys are in need of immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root should at once be
taken upon the least sign of ill
health. It will make you well, and
is for sale the world over in bot-
tles of two sizes and two prices,
fifty-cent and one dollar.
Swamp-Root is used in the
leading hospitals, recommended
by skillful physicians in their pri-
vate practice, and is taken by doc-
tors themselves who have kidney
ailments, because they recognize
in it' the greatest and most suc-
cessful remedy for kidney, liver
and bladder troubles.
To prove its wonderful effi-
cacy, send your name and address
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bingham-
ton, N. V., mentioning that you
read this generous offer in the
San Francisco Call, when you
will receive immediately, free of

C. \V. Clark was next called. He was
questioned concerning letters from Dr.
Ector to himself, his father and Bickford,
which were referred to In Ector's testi
mony yesterday and to which the letters
from Senator Clark produced yesterday
were said to be replies. He raid he had
last seen them during the Wellcome dis
barment trial, and was sure that he had
put them in his trunk to bring East. He
could not flnd them, however, and thought
they must be in New York. He was sure
he had not destroyed them and said he
would go to New York and get them.
The next witness was Charles W. Jack
eon, a newspaper man. residing in Salt
Lake. Utah, and a member of the Legisla
ture of that State. He testified that hÂ«
had met Clark at the Knutsford Hotel. In
Salt Lake, during the Senatorial deadlock
in that State last February, and that
Clark had tried to influence him to vote
for McCune for United States Senator
from Utah. Intimating that In case he
would do so he would be paid for the act.
Relating to the conversation, Jackson
said that Clark had said that McCune
was a liberal man who never forgot his
friends. Clark f=aid that if the witness
could see his way clear to voting for Mc-
Cune he had no doubt McCune would do
something handsome for him.
Jackson said he had declined, and that
Clark had then proceeded to argue the
point, saying that all the scandals of that
character soon died out: that it was thiÂ»
custom of men of wealth to epend money
to secure election to the Senate. Jackson
paid Clark cited the case of Senator Han
na of Ohio as In point. Continuing, he
said that Clark stated that in his own
case he had used money to secure his own
flection, which had then but recently oc
curred. His election caused some talk,
and some members had foolishly exhibited
â¢ome bills In a careless way, but he had
no doubt that the talk would die out and
he would hear little of It. Clark had
asked him to regard the conversation as
confidential.
When Jackson concluded his testimony
it was announced that no more witnesses
would be examined before "Wednesday
next, and after an executive session the
court adjourned.

nounced It a case of ptomaine poison-
Ing. I kept getting worse and worse
and was obliged to call In another
doctor. Between the two, I was enabled
to get out of bed and go to my labors
at the end of three weeks. I worked
for a day or two and felt that it woulc!
be necessary for me to go back to bed.
This would have proved a great hard-
ship to me, as I had already lost three
weeks' wages and did not know how
long I would be obliged to remain in
bed.
"My wife had a sample bottle of Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root in the house,
and she urged me to try It. I refused
at first, saying that It would not help
me, but at her earnest solicitations I
took a dose as a last resort. Wonder-
ful to relate, I felt better after the
medicine had performed its functions,
and I kept on taking It. I continued to
improve, and after the sample bottle
was exhausted I bought a large bottle.
I must tell you that I did not take to
my bed during all this time, but went
to my daily work without any interrup-
tion, and I assure you I felt grateful to
Dr. Kilmer for his discovery of the
astonishing properties of Swamp-
Root.
"Before my attack of ptomaine
poisoning, I suffered a great deal from
malaria' and stomach trouble. My sys-
tem became so run down that I was
unable to withstand the effects of the
ptomaine poisoning, and so was obliged
to take to my bed. I struck the root of
my trouble, however, when I began
taking Swamp-Root for my kidneys,
which caused the pains in my back.
Thanks to the persistence of my wife,
I tried it, and its effects have been al-
most magical. It took effect at once,
and I think it has been a mental stim-
ulus as well as a physical restorative.
In a few days I have gained in strength,
and no longer feel that tired sensation
after a day's work which I felt hither-
to. All praise to Dr. Kilmer for the
good he is doing, has done, and will do
for suffering humanity with* his
Swamp- Root, for he has indeed been a
life saver to me,'

Two San Francisco Hunters Arrested
in San Rafael.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO. Jan. 13.â L. Caslne, a
liquor merchant of Fifth and Howard
streets, and O. Possio of 191 Fourth street,
San Francisco, to-day occupied the unique
position of being prosecuted by the son
of the man who invited them to shoot
over his preserves.
John Mclsaac is the father of Hugh Me-
Isaac, the District Attorney of San Ra
fael, and It was while hunting on the Mc-
Isa.ic estate that the two sportsmen were
arrested. They were brought before Judge
Itodden and fined $20 each.
Bright and early this morning the hunt
ers left San Francisco, confident of re
turning with loads of Juicy canvasbacks
before night. As the day went on and no
game fell before their guns their hopes
sank. At noon to-day they sat down to
eat their lunch and while engaged in this
operation a confident meadow lark, secure
in the protection Marin's game laws afford
his tnbe. drew near. He saw crumbs
and ate them. Seeing him unharmed,
other birds gathered round, and it was
then that Casine saw a chance to retrieve
his reputation. Communicating his plan
to Posslo, the two, after plentifully dis
tributing the debris of their meal around,
withdrew to a fence.
The larks bore down on the crumbs and
were eating peacefully when Casine's gun
let loose and a stout bird fell . Posslo
followed suit, and soon a dozen birds lay
dead. Then, proudly displaying the prools
of their prowess, the happy hunters came
to Sausalito. Their ostentation led to their
downfall. Constable Agnew saw the birds
and after questioning the men arrested
them. They were brought to San Rafael,
where the son of their host conducted the
case against them. After producing $20
the two caught the first train for the city,
not stopping to exchange greetings wltb
the Mclsaacs.

SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 13.â William Davia.
the wealthy saddler of San Francisco, was
married here to-day to Mac Merrill of
Portland, Or. The ceremony was per
formed by Judge Gardner. â¢ If they are
happy under the matrimonial yoke, the
old saw that "crabbed ago and youth can
not live together" will be contradicted, for
Davis is on the wrong side of 60 and rheu
matic, while Miss Merrill blushlngly owns
up to 33.
Davis will be remembered In connection
with the sensational divorce cult which
he figured in about a year ago as a "star
actor." To-day's union was the sequence
of a contract marriage which was signed
before Attorney Frank Colton of San
Francisco two months ago.
Aft^r the knot was tied Davis left his

they departed for San Francisco.

day. when I felt unusually weak and
thought that death was not far away
from me. I picked up an advertisement
which happened to be lying close by.
and read about the qualities of Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root and what it would
do for human ills that flesh is heir to.
I threw the paper away, but 'Swamp-
Root' kept dancing before my ey?9
until I determined to try it. I sent one
of the members of my family after two
bottles at a nearby drug store, and
immediately took the directed dose.
After I had consumed the two bottles
I was able to go downtown after It
myself, and I brought home two more
bottles. By this time the weakness in
the bladder had disappeared entirely
and the pains in my back and legs had
been sensibly diminished. I kept on
taking it. however, until now I have
consumed eleven bottles, and as a re-
sult I feel better to-day than I have in
ten years. The Swamp-Root seemed to
take hold of the trouble at once, jÂ».nd
now all the pains have disappeared. X
propose to continue Its use, however,
until I have taken a half dozen morÂ»
bottles, as I do not want a return of
the trouble.
"I can say positively that I was cured
of a weak and irritable bladder by tha
use of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp Root, and
I am deeply appreciative of my releasa
from what was often an embarrassing
and distressing ailment. A man may
enjoy the most perfect health in every
other respect and yet be In continual
misery because of weak bladder. I
now feel bright as a twenty-dollar gold
piece, and consider that my cure has
been effected at a surprisingly low
rate, considering what I have paid to
the doctors for negative results."
GONVINGEO OF THE
CURATIVE PROPERTIES
OF SWAMP-ROOT
Kidney Complaint of Years'
Standing Yields to This
Great Vegetable Compound,
Samuel B. Swan Is at present en-
gineer of the Hayes-street power-
house, a position he has occupied for
the past twelve years. Mr. Swan be-
gan firing on engines when he was
only 14 years of age, and was a loco-
motive engineer at the early age of ID.
He saw the last spike driven on the-
Central Pacific Railroad, and he is an
enthusiastic advocate of the excellent
curative properties of Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root. When a Call reporter in-
terviewed him regarding the subject.
and requested him to give an honest
expression of opinion of the medicine,
he quickly replied:
"You cannot quote me too strongly
as being In favor of Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root. Everybody knows that
the position of locomotive engineer
acts harmfully on the kidneys, on ac-
count of the constant jar one is sub-
jected to. That was my case. For
years I suffered with pains in the
back, superinduced by bad action of
my kidneys. Constipation, long con-
tinued, made me a very sick man. and
I consulted a dozen physicans. none of.
whom afforded me any relief. I re-
member a brother locomotive en-
gineer, who knew something of medi-
cine, who used to put me up some cap-
sules filled with something or other.
They did me some good, but It was not
lasting.
"Thing 3 with me kept getting from
bad to worse, and the pains In my back
became unbearable, when my attention
was attracted to the advertisements of
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root. I made up
my mind that I would give it a fair
test, and when I undertake to do any-
thing I generally carry it through. I
therefore resolved to take ten bottles,
and if no good effects resulted I would
discontinue using It. My faith In it
may be understood when I tell you that
I have used fourteen bottles, and I can
truthfully say that it has done me a
world of good, and I am a better man
to-day than I ever was in my life. I
feel fresh and vigorous, and ascribe it
entirely to my use of Dr. Kilmer'9
Swamp-Root. I began by taking It
three times a day, and now I take it
twice a day. I will reduce the dose to
one spoonful a day, and feel that it will
put me in such a condition that I may
soon stop the use of it altogether. I
will say, however, that I will alway3
have a bottle handy In case of neces-
sity, as I consider it to be better than a
hundred doctors all rolled into one.
"Put me down as indorsing the vir-
tues of Dr. Kilmer's Swamp- Root In a
most emphatic manner, because It does
everything and more than claimed by
Its manufacturers."

WITNESSES TALK OF COIN
HOW THE SENATOR JUSTIFIED
HIS COURSE.
Hemarked to a Salt Lake Legislator
That It Was Customary for
Rich Men to Buy Seats
in the Senate.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.-When the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions bÂ«-pan its session to-day in the case
of Senator Clark of Montana the defense
frtated that they had been unable to find
the letters written to Senator Clark and
liickford by the dentist, Ector, who yes
trrday produced their letters to him. It
was then decided to have C. W. Clark,
eon cf the Senator, make a statement as
to tho disposition of the documents, but
Clark being temporarily absent Gaxr was
recalled to afford Senator Turley an op
portunity to question him concerning his
visit to He'er.a prior to the meeting of the
Legislature last winter. Garr caM the
principal object of his visit was to see
about his resignation aa United States
Commissioner.
The rim regular witness of the day was
M. L. Hewitt, a miner, who was In Helena
curing the session of the legislature in
1KÂ«. He said that "Charley" Clark had
oked him to pee Senator Myers and offer
him $1000 for his vote for Clark for Sena
ter. He had accordingly talked with My
ers and he testified that that gentleman
had told him. after first declining: the
proposition, to say to Clark that if he
were disposed to do so he could put $10,003
1:: the hands of Whiteside to be paid to
him (Myers) In case he should vote for
Ciark. Hewitt said that Clark's son said
that, this arrangement was satisfactory
and had afterward told him that the
money for Myers had been given to White
tide and that his vote was assured.
Hewitt said that during the Senatorial
c r.-est he had talked frequently with
Senator Clark. Or.cc he had remonstrated
with the Senator concerning Whiteside as
a well-known supporter of Daly, but the
Srr.ator had, he said, assured him that
Whiteside's fidelity was assured because
of the fact that he (.Whiteside). was in
trouble with the Clark opponents over a
building he was constructing inÃutte. The
witness also said that he had seen the
Senator at his rooms at the Helena Hotel
a short time after the Whiteside exposure
and had asked him what he proposed to
do, when the Senator had replied:
"There is only one thing to do, and that
is to make the people believe that the
Daly pang has furnished the money and
I>ut up a conspiracy against Senator
Clark."
"I asked him." continued the witness,
â¢â¢if he could make that stick, to which he
replied:
"There is no trouble about the deal,
because if we put up a good excuse the
people will believe us. and we can again
S<t the members together." "
The witness detailed a conversation
â¢which he said he had with Senator Clark
on the eve of the Investigation by the
Supreme Court, in which he told the Sen
ator that Tom Lyons, one of the Sena
tor's workers, had threatened to go to
court and testify against Clark, because
the latter's friends had not kept their
promise* to him. According to the wit
jif-p.v, tho Senator had then replied:
"I don't owe these (using an offen
sive phrase) anything. I have paid them
a!l they asked. I am under no obliga
tion to them, and I expect them to do as
they agreed to do by me."
Hewitt said, however, that Clark added
that he would have his son see Lyons,
lie said that Clark had often spoken to
him of his son and Wellcome. Blckford
Stecle and others as his friends in the
Senatorial fight. Wellcome and "Char
ley" Clark were regarded as the Senator's
special representatives.
On crocs-examination, Hewitt said he
v.-as a Republican and not especially in
terested In any of the Senatorial candi
dates. He had "just drifted Into the con
test." He pronounced as incorrect the

CZAR THANKS HIS
FOREIGN MINISTER
Speaks of the Progress
of Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 13.â The Czar
has addressed a rescript to Count Mura
vieff, the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
highly eulogistic of the eminent qualities
displayed by the Mnister in bringing about
a happy eoluton in conformity with the
CxarÂ» instructions of the disquieting po
litical events arising from the Cretan in
surrection and the Turko-Grecian war.
thus showing true appreciation of the his
toric mission which has fallen to the lot
of Russia. After remarking that the in
troduction of an autonomous administra
tion In Crete ended the agitation which
had so long troubled the repose of thÂ«
Turkish East, while the maintenance of
the most friendly relations with all the
powers shows the fruitful influence of
Russia's peaceful and continuous policy,
the rescript proceeds:
Appointed ruirdian of the most Important
IntÂ«re3ts cf the State, you have co-operated,
while conforming exactly with the Indications
I gave you. in the realization of the traditional
tendency of Russia to obtain in the Far East
an lcÂ«-free outlet to the sea. An agreement
arrived at with the Government If China rela
tive to the cession in L'sufrlet of the Hwang
Lung Peninsula, with Ports Arthur and Italmy,
while testifying to the reciprocal friendship
Â«nd confidence wiich exists between the two
great neighboring; empires, fulfills the evident
necessities of Russia, as a maritime power, and
will create in the Pacific a new center for the
commercial and industrial enterprise* of the
entire world. The negotiation* vubzequently
undertaken under my direction with the British
and Jai>Â»ne*e Governments led to the conclu
sion of partial understandings, which, by re
moving any reason for mteunderstanclings In
the rolltical domain, enable Russia to devote
her strength to the progressive development
of the prosperity of her possessions In the Far
East.
I feel r*rtlcnlar satisfaction in recording
among the eervlces you have rendered the ef
forts and care you have consecrated to the ful
fillment Of tny inmost desire to assure to all
peoples the benefits of real and durable peace.
The results of the late conference at The Hague
give me steadfast confidence that the solid
bases have been eÂ«tablishd for the realisation
of alms fo dear to my heart. AH the powers

HADDON HALL'S
UNLUCKY CRUISE
Lost Five Men Since
Leaving Home.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
ASTORIA. Or.. Jan. 13.â The British
bark Haddon Hall, which arrived in port
last evening from Panama, reports the
loss of five of her men since leaving her
home port. The death of the men is par
ticularly sad. because of the fact that all
came from the same town and shipped at
the same time. The Haddon Hall is what
is known as a "family ship." the captain
and crew all coming in from Carnavon.
Wales
The vessel left home two years ago and
the first death among her men occurred
while she was passing through the small
Inlands north of Australia. These islands
are inhabited by some of the most fero
cious cannibals and the rumor was cur
rent that several vessels had been at
tacked by the natives, who were said to
have captured the entire crew of one ship.
Captain Pritchard of the Haddon Hall de
termined to prepare for any attack which
might be made and all the men were pro
vided with firearms. The expected attack
did not take place, however, but one of
the apprentices, while handling a revol
ver, shot another through the head, kill
ing him instantly. The shooting was ac
cidental and the young man who killed
his friend was almost crazed with grief.
Then the Haddon Hall went to Panama.
At the isthmian port yellow fever broke
out among the crew, and soon three of
the apprentices succumbed to the scourge.
Others were taken ill. but recovered.
The last death occurred off the mouth
of the Columbia yesterday. During a
heavy fog. the vessel got in too close to
shore, and for a while It was feared she
would be wrecked. The wind was blow
ing a gale, and it became necessary to
shorten sail. While aloft. Robert Grif
fiths, another apprentice, fell frora the
foretopsail yard. Lines were thrown to

GOLF CRACKS
COMPETE AT
ADAMS POINT
Rawlins Gains a Slight Lead
on tin First Eighteen
Holes.
The first professional golf tournament
ever held in California began yesterday
on the Oakland Club's links. The six con
testants were drawn In pairs as follows:
David Stephenson, San Francisco Golf
Club, and T. W. Tetley, San Rafael Golf
Club; James Melville of Del Monte and
Alexander Smith of Coronado; Willie An
derson and H. Rawlins, both of the Oak
land Golf Club. Though hole play would
have been more Interesting and a fairer
test of the merits of the competitors, it
would have required longer time, so it
was decided the tournament should be
over 36 holes, stroke play.
All the contestants, except T. W. Tet
ley had been around the course several
times previously, Rawllns and Anderson
being the regular instructors of the Oak
land Club, and Melville having been a
professional on- those links. Stephenson
has puld several visits to Adams Point
and "Sandy" Smith came up from the
south two or three days ago, so as to
familiarize himself to some extent with
the course. Tetley was also handicapped
by the fact that he has just recovered
from a serious spell of illness, and played
more from a sporting desire not to with
draw from a contest he had entered than
for any other reason. A gallery of forty
or flfty people followed Rawlins and An
derson around the course, and several ac
companied Melville and Alec Smith. The
course was heavy and in places extremely
muddy, as the chocs and white skirts of
many fair enthusiasts who went around
from green to green testified. Almost all
the competitors were plainly nervous at
being called on to perform in the pres
ence of so many spectators, but Stephen
son was particularly so.
Rawllns made the best round of the
dayâ the first nine holes in 87; and though
in the second round he fell off consider
ably, taking 47 strokes for the nine holes,
his total of 84 was the lowest. Next came
Smith with S6. Melville with SS. Ander
son with S9. Stephenson with 91 and Tet
ley with 115. Tetley got badly bunkered
at the eighth hole, taking twelve strokes
for it. H. Rawllns played the best all
around game, and Stephenson did well in
all respects except In putting. Anderson
was not in his best form, though his sec
ond round was somewhat better tnan his
first. Melville drove, approached and
putted in good style. Had Alec Smith's
llrst round been as good as his second
the total would have placed him at the
head of the list.
In front of the eighth green was a lit
tle lake, about 30 feet long by 10 feet wide,
of what golfers call "casual water," the
result of the recent heavy rains. Raw
lins' ball on the second round fell right
into this, so that he had to wade in and
play it as it floated, succeeding in reach
ing the green in two. Smith made the
last hele of the second round in two
strokes. The number of strokes for each
hole Is shown below:
D. Stephenson â
Out 5 5 5 7 6 4 5 5 4-45
In 5 5 8 5 4 4 5 6 6 â 4Sâ 91

In 4 5 5 6 4 4 6 5 6â43â89
The second eighteen holes will be
played to-day, beginning at 10:30. The
tournament Is In charge of a greens com
mlttee, consisting of P. E. Bowles, W. P.
Johnson and F. S. Stratton. The official
scorers are as follows: G. S. Wheaton for
\V. Anderson. E. J. McCutchen for Al
exander Smith, G. D. Greenwood for J.
Melville. H. H. Smith for D. Stephenson.
H. H. Sherwood for T. W. Tetley and G.
P. Gow for H. Rawllns. As only seven
strokes separate the five leaders, it is
anybody's match yef. with the odds
slightly on Horace Rawllns and Alec
Smith. The course has a distance of 2943
yards, or a little more than three and
one-third miies for the eighteen holes.
The golf played to-day may fairly be ex
pected to surpass that of yesterday, as
the competitors will have gained a knowl
edge of each other and of the course, and
all will be on their mettle.

16WHILE riding a bicycle on
Kolsom street yesterday
morning, Joel C. Booth, a
medical student, was run
ovor by a milk wagon. His head was
crushed beneath the horses' hoofs and
the wagon wheels, and it is believed
his injuries will prove fatal. The ac
cident cccured at Nineteenth and Fol-
Eoni streets, and Dr. Covey, the com
paniori of Joel Booth, is inclined to
place the blame on J. A. Schmidt, the
driver of the wagon. Schmidt was ur-
rested and detained at the City
Prison, pending the result of Booth's
Injuries- 1
Booth and Dr. Covey were riding
en their "bikes" out Folsom street
toward the City and County Hos
pital. At Nineteenth street they were
approached by a milk wagon from
the Schwerin dairy. The cyclists
were in the middle of the track and
the wagon on the right side.
When on the crossing the driver
drove across the car tracks at right
angles to the wheelmen. ,- . .

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS.
P. M. Wellin Appointed Superinten
dent of Hepairfe and School
Buildings.
The Board of l'ublic Works yesterday
appointed P. M. Wellin superintendent of
repair* anil school buildings at a salary
of Zlh't per month.
Sheriff Uickmann's request that new
Jocks be provided for the County Jails was
granted.
Commissioner Manson wa3 empowered
to confer with tin- Auditor regarding the
condition of the funds which will come
under the board's jurisdiction.
it was decided to prepare a system of
checking In the matter of school supplies
and repairs, and the individual responsi
bility of employes will be rigidly enforced.
Commissioner, Manson filed a report
showing the area of floors and corridors
in the City Hull thai the janitors will bo
compelled to keep clean.
The appointment of assistant janitors
will be.taJien up to-morrow, morning.
there was danger of a collision, he
f=ays he put on the brakes and check
ed the horses, but it was too late.
Schmidt asserts that the wheelmen
were going at a rapid pace, and that
this prevented Booth from turning
out of the track in time to avoid be
ins struck.
Booth is a student, just completing
his term at the College of Physicians
and Surgeons. His home is in Ore
gon, amj.hc came to San Francisco
to renew his study of medicine at the
close of the Spanish war. He spent
six months in Manila as a hospital
steward and was honorably discharg
ed on his ifrturn in the hospital ship.
He is in his last year at the college
and is very popular with both faculty
and students. His brother is. now on
the way to this city from the family
home at Lebanon, Or.
Owing to the effect of the new char
ter in regard to releases on one's own
recognizance, J. A. Schmidt cannot
secure his , release from prison. He
cannot now | be charged with any
crime, and consequently the amount
of his bail or bond cannot be deter
mined.' â¢ '^-V^;'v -. â¢ -Â¦--^Â»,- t Â¦":Â¦

GRAPE-NUTS
Sensible Hint
oq pood
Rom a
California Woman
"If you could hear all the experiences
I have been at some pains to investi-
gate you would put a warning in the"
largest type on the boxes of Grape-
Nuts and beg (?) consumers to limit
themselves to the amount mentioned in
the directions."
True you do say "Grape-Nuts food is
condensed; oat but throe or four heap-
ing teaspoons at a meal." But the food
seemed to fill such a long-felt want
or.d every one found it so delicious,
cither clone or in combination with
some other material, that, overlooking
the Email type announcement of its bc-
'â¢ng condensed, they have, eaten too
much, and when the body is repeatedly,
p:vÂ«n more food thau it can use. even
if that food be most delicious, there is
D natural revulsion, and the long look-
ed for and valuable food is laid aside.
I advise persons who have had this
experience to put Grape-Nuts on their
nu-nu again and eat never more than
four teaspoonsful at a time. Then one
g^ts the powerful rebuilding: strength
of the food and looks forward with zest
to eai-h coming meal. It has been a
crent blessing to our family."â Mrs. W.
P. Bakflr. Los Angeles, CaL
mood, and if tho language he used was
not strong enough to show how his tender
hide has been seared by the expose in the
newspapers of his methods, his flushed
face and emphatic gestures alone carried
out in graphic style an idea of how keenly
he has felt the lash. He announced the
toast to which Commissioner Newhall
was to reply as "Police."
In replying: to the toast Mr. Newhall
introduced his subject by paying that if
he had been invited to discourse on the
subject of street railroa:is. or some, oth-.r
topic with which he was perfectly fa
miliar, he might do it justice ami ray
something interesting, but that as it was
he would do his best. He said:
I take it that there Is only one question you
want me to answer, and that it? who is going
to L-e the next Chief of Police. You also want
to know from me what we are tsoinp to do p*?n
erally. As th* hour is late, I will say that
acting Chief Ilipgy. who you have I'orhaps
noticed has disappeared, is niakins another raid
to-niEht. and so you see that Use Police t'e
parttnent is active, notwithstanding you have
no chief.
Whether we will elect ,\ chief or not I am
not prepared to say, because i don't know th.U
we nevd one. It is a very import;mt comniis
sion. and it Is very important that we give
the people the vÂ»ry best service we possibly
can. Such is the intention of the Police Com
mission. On behalf of the street railroads and
ethers I would now ask all to drink to the
health of the Mayor.
A striking feature of Mr. Newhall's
speech was his utter failure to back the
â¢ Mayor up in his statement that no mem
, ber ttf the commission had been pledged.
He could have thus appeared in a star
role, but !t is probable that Mr. Newhall's
conscience would not permit such a per
formance. However, his toast to the
Mayor was really an attempt to gloss over
hi? failure in this respect by an appear
ance of personal regard and sociability.
His utterance concerning acting Chief
Biggy was greeted with tremendous
cheering.
Franklin K. Lane closed the evop.ing's
festivity. It devolved upon him to hand
out the floral tributes to the Mayor, and
he w;is lavish in his bestowal.
"We have a leader." suid he. "who will
always lead us in the right if we follow
him. I'pon this mighty crusade for mu
nicipal reform he has bestowed his time,
his brains and his millions. To it he has
given his d:iys, ana to him they are ex
pensive days.
"What he has done with his nights, of
courso we cannot say." added Mr. Lane
facetiously, and after the general laugh
ter had died down he closed with trib
utes to the officials of both creeds and to
the Commissioner? lately appointed.
The different toasts of the evening and
those who replied to them were as fol
lows:
"Public Works," George H. Mendell:
"Freeholders." Joseph Brittan: "Police."
George A. Newhall; "Schools." C. W.

THE GOLDEN JUBILEE
OF OUR STATEHOOD
NATIVE SONS ARE PREPARING
FOR THE EVENT.
James D. Phelan Chosen as President
of the Committee on Celebration.
Others in Charge.
Last night there was a meeting of the
Ninth of September celebration commit
tee of Native Sons of the Golden West in
Balboa Hall of the Native Sons' building,
for the purpose of perfecting a permanent
organization. There was present a large
number of those delegated to represent
the several parlors. The meeting was
called to order by H. G. W. Dinkelspiel
of Bay City Parlor. The tlrst business
was tlie. election of officers. E. M. Wolf
placed in nomination Will D. Shea of Call
lornia Parlor; J. E. O'Donnell nominated
James D. Phelan of Pacific Parlor. Mr.
Shea declined in favor of Mr. Phelan, and
on motion he was elected by acclamation.
John T. Graney of Pacific Parlor nom
inated for vice president frank H. Dunne
of that parlor, and he, too, was elected by
acclamation, there being no other candi
date. James L. Gallagner of Alcatraz
nominated for second vice president H. G.
W. Dinkelspiel of Bay City Parlor. There
being no other nominee, he, too, was
elected by acclamation.
Stephen V. Costello of Pacific Parlor
nominated Will D. Shea of California,
and he was unanimously elected secre
tary.
Daniel A. Ryan of Pacific Parlor nom
inated P. dv Py of National Parlor, and
being the only nominee he was elected by
acclamation.
On motion of J. L. Gallagher, a com
mittee of five will be appointed by Presi
dent Phelan to prepare an order of busi
ness and determine how the committees
that are to manage the celebration shall
be appointed. ;
Will D. Shea, Lewis F. Byington and
J. J. Jamison were appointed a permanent
committee on credentials.
R. W. Neil suggested that as a means
to obtain funds a baseball tournament
should be inaugurated in March next
under the auspices of the Native Sons. A
committee of three was appointed to con
sider the suggestion. Messrs. Abbott.
Dinkelspiel and Shea were appointed as
such committee.
W. P. Johnson of Sequoia Parlor was
appointed sergeant at arms.
The committee adjourned to the call of
the chair.

TAX REBATE SWINDLER.
More Pirms Notify Assessor That
They Have Been Victimized.
fceverai more complaints were received
yesterday fey Assessor Doilge from firms
who have been victimized by an impostor
who represented himself as a Deputy As
sessor and secured assignments or rebates
<iue them on personal property taxes. The
first complaint was from Cluett. Peabody
& Co., who assigned their claim to the
Â¦windier for $17 22, when the amount of
rebnte coming to th r 'm wa..s actually J.?O 40.
Steps w< re immediately taken by Chief
Deputy Ginty to stop the payment of the
claiirjjin the Treasurer's office and also
tn <Â°. j^chend the guilty party.
The Sierra Nevada Mining Company was
nlso mulcted to the extent of SIS 10. Other
rtrms who have been victimized are C. A.
Murdock & Co.. Bosqui Engraving and
Printing Company. Carrau & Green.
The mannr-r in which the payment of
rebates is effected appears to make fraud
possible in this connection. It has been
customary for the convenience of the tax
payer to irsue to him a certificate coun
tersigned by Chief Deputy Assessor flin
ty showing that he has paid his taxes for
i he fiscal year. The fact that the rate
was fixed at $1 63 after collection had been
made at the old rate of $1 SI entitles him
to collect the rebate on presentation of
the certificate to the City Treasurer.
These certificates bear the name of Wash
ington Dodge in printed letters and it was
an easy matter to print an exact copy of
the certificate and for the imnostor to
pursue his operations.
The swindler. Who is said to be a tall
man with a <lark ffoaiee; is believed to be
a man who was an employe of the AsspsÂ«-
or*a office Inst spring. Ginty will not dis
closf his name, however, until a search
ing investigation has been made.

The appointed as well as the elect at
tended the fÂ«?aÂ£t given at the Palace Hotel
Last evening by thÂ« Lord Mayor of New
San Francisco. The tables were spread
10 accommodate one hundred, and very
nearly all ol the invited participated in
the fui.ction.
The pregrt-.-sive young men selected by
the Mayor for the various commissions
under the new charter made a brave dis
play at the banquet board. Conspicuous
in the galaxy of youth and energy were
Colom-1 George H. Mendell, U. S. A. (re
tirirdi. Ja.-pt-r McDonald, Reuben H.
L-lcvd. Dr. McNutt and Joseph H. Brit
ton. The last mentioned was neither elect
ed nor appointed to office, but was invited
faf a iriend of the court and a father of
>.>tv San Kraucfsco.
The Mayor in the double role of host
itnd toustmaster had frequent opportunity
to tjit^ik. and thcrtforc it. .-.Â¦-â¢ several
clever little speeches. He was hardly
ju."t:nÂ»Mj as the host in correcting at the
table juajct Bahrs of the judiciary, ii was
not the time and place to appeal from the
juogrnent of the Superior Court-
Judge Bahrs, be it mir.ded. was- accord
ed the privilege of speaking the senti
ments oi the judiciary. Mellowed by the
genial atmosphere ot the banquet * hail,
and Inspired by the generous wine, he
likened the .r-ast to the famous banquets
of the Lot'J Mayor of London, and ex
pressed the hope that the Â«.-ustom to ha;>
hUy e>tab!i.-hed in San Francisco by
ilayor Phelan would be perpetuated. The
cheerful sentiment was applauded to the
echo.
Hm guests were surely surprised when
tlie Mayor asserted that his dinner did
not in any sense resemble a banquet by
the Lord Mayor of London. Perhaps if
the Maynr had permittel Judgre liahrs'
remarks to pass unchallenged some un
gracious critic might have accused htm
of entertaining British sympathies. Any
way the Mayor reproved one of his guests
at the table and did not administer the
reproof with grace or tact.
The interchange of bouquets at the ban
quet was a feature. Joseph Britton tossed
a bunch of flowers to the Mayor, and tho
latter sent pome sw^-ct-sccnted violets to
the Board <t Public Woiks. Colonel Men
dell lingered awhile over .the fragrance
ar.d ga\"<* bffl associates a sniff. Supervisors
Â£ar.r:< rs-'n. Hotaling and Dwyer passed
up comti'.iments to other members of the
board, and received In return taffy with
interest. As th<> banquet progressed th*>
Ebouta < f enthusiasm at the mention of
New San Francisco grew louder and more
prolong- .-d. At midnight the new govern
irrr.t was fully inaugurated.

ternational interest. Prisoners crowded in so fast that
an addition had to be made to the town for their ac
commodation. There was a touch of sardonic humor
in naming the streets after the towns the British want
to capture.
The kindliness and charity of some people are al
most beyond comprehension. The Chattanooga
actress who sent a gentleman to his eternal rest with
a bullet says she would restore him to life if she
could.
Local firemen have taken many a tumble in.their
rough experience, but it was not until the Mayor
touched the match of his political ambition that they
knew what an explosion was. ,'

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
AAYOR PHELAN in the course of his mes
sage submitted to the Board of Supervisors
on January 8 said: "The Police Department
will be reorganized and will be more accountable to
the people than in the past." He then went on to
refer to the demoralizing effect of the corruption in
Chinatown upon the department and said: "It ex
ercises as malign an influence over the police as did
the quasi-public corporations over the Supervisors in
the past, but as the city found men to withstand the
blandishments of the corporations, so must we find
men who will do their duty in Chinatown. Public
gambling is a great evil, leading to poverty, disgrac-,
defalcation and death, which the records of this city
abundantly prove, and its practice should be dis
countenanced and suppressed.
With those words the Mayor gave encouragement
to the hope of those who believed that under the new
charter we were to have reform in police methods.
The disclosures that have followed the appointment of
the new commission have gone far to dissipate that
hope. The Call has proof that the Mayor had no
option in the appointment of the Police Commission.
The Commissioners whom he named were appointed
at the dictation of a gang whose interests are with
the white gamblers, if not with those in Chinatown.
The commission was pledged to choose for the Chief
of Police a man who in turn is pledged to appoint as
chief of the detective force a corrupt rascal known
as a thief and a defaulter and once a fugitive from the
justice of the employer he had robbed.
The appointment of such men to positions which
give them complete control of the police affairs
means a "wide open" town for gamblers, blackmail
ers and all other vicious persons who prey upon the
weakness or the corruption of the community. It
may be possible they will draw the line at Chinatown
and purify that quarter of the city while leaving the
rest "wide open," but it is not likely. Between the
corruption of white gamblers and the corruption of
the yellow gamblers there is an affinity of purpose
which will lead them to act together in evading ths
law and corrupting the police.
The Mayor's statement that the police .force will
be more accountable to the people under the new ad
ministration than under the old appears in the light
of these revelations to be the grossest hypocrisy.
The Mayor is aware that he named the Commission
ers ?.t the dictation of a gang of gamblers; that he
knew they would appoint as Chief of Police a man
who would connive at all forms of vice that could be
made profitable to the gang. With what conscious
ness of honesty, then, could he assert that the police
force would be more accountable to the people than
it had been?
The Commissioners who have been chosen to carry
out this conspiracy are men of whom the people have
a right to expect better things. They have been
known as men of high standing in the business world
and c.l good repute in social life. They are not ig
norant of the corrupt influences of public gam
bling and of the menace which exists to the com
munity in that form of vice. As the Mayor stated
in his message, the records of the Police Department
itself show that poverty, disgrace, defalcation and
death result from it. Many of the worst and black
est cases in our criminal calendar can be traced di
rectly to the effects of gambling. Such being the
case, it is not too much to hope that men having a
stake in the community, interested in the welfare of
society and desirous of retaining their respect and
the esteem of their fellow-citizens, will refuse to go
further in this conspiracy. It is no fault of theirs that
they have been duped thus far, but if they now carry
out the plot knowing what the end will be, their fault
will be grievous indeed, amounting to absolute dis
honor.

JURY TRIAL FOR CONTEMPT.
THE Chicago platform, which offered everything
from a splinter to a whole plank as a standing
place for all the financial discontent and eco
nomic diseases of the country, declared in favor of
taking the punishment of contempt of court out of
the hands of Judges and making it the subject of a
jury trial. No one, not even the motley clad support
ers of Mr. Bryan, was supposed to intend such a
preposterous proposition seriously. In California
some effort was made to get up a political furor on
the cry, "No government by injunction," but it
ceased after the election of 1898. The issue was de
vised originally to flatter mobs that had been judi
cially enjoined from entering upon or destroying the
property of others or by violence preventing its
legitimate and lawful use by its owner. Here seemed
a chance to get votes by breaking down the main
safeguard of the rights of property. The injunction
is to property exactly what the habeas corpus is to
the person. It is one of the most necessary writs in
any condition of society that implies respect for the
rights of property.
But these considerations do not seem to impress
the demagogues who are out for office at no matter
what sacrifice of the rights of property and the in
terests of the people.
The issue is made fresh by the introduction into
the House by Mr. Jett of Illinois of a bill which pro
vides that all acts which are contempt of court not
committed in the presence of the court shall be triable
by a jury of the vicinity in which the act is committed.
The author of this pernicious measure says that it
will pass, and that Republican members of the Judi
ciary Committee have assured him of their support,
declaring that the bill is beyond criticism.
It is difficult to believe that this is to be taken se
riously. Of necessity every violation of a permanent
injunction is contempt of court, though such viola
tion can never be in the presence of the court.
Therefore the injunction as a means of protecting
property rights is practically abolished by Mr. Jett's
Take an illustration that is near at hand. After
long and costly litigation the Federal court in this
city issued a permanent injunction against all hy
draulic mining which imperiled navigation or which
by overflow of debris or water from an obstructed
channel destroyed agricultural land. We need not
remind the farmers of Sutter and Yuba counties of
the agony and bloody sweat they underwent in pro
curing that injunction, nor of the cost they endured
in enforcing it. Many times its violators were caught
in the act by their patrols and were punished by the
Federal court for contempt of its writ. There is no
other writ, no other process known to jurisprudence,
by which those valley farmers can be protected
against the entire destruction of their property.
Without that injunction they will be compelled to
retire before the floods that will sweep away or bury
all they have.
Now let us suppose that the Jett bill become? the
law and the long toms are turned on again in the
mountains, as they would be, and the slickens again
slimed its way to destroy the valley lands. The im
peri'ed farmers would of course invoke the injunc
tion. Its violators would be airested, but the court's
hands would be tied. The guilty men would have to
be tried before "a jury of the vicinity where the con
tempt was committed." Does any one doubt the re
sult? Does any one believe that under such a system
that injunction would be worth the paper it is written
on? Does any one believe that the acts it enjoins
and forbids would ever cease under the Jett bill un
til the mountains were washed into the valleys? Mr.
Jett is pursuing the Bryan method with his bill. He
calls judicial punishment of contempt "the use of ar
bitrary power," and says that his bill is opposed only
by the corporation press. But we cannot believe it
possible that the people are to be fooled by such
chatter.
The bill is an infamous attack upon a safeguard of
property of which the poor, not the rich, stand in
need. The principle it proposes to establish opens the
way for robbery of those who cannot defend them
selves. We do not go too far in saying that when it
is the law the ;veak or peacable property-owner can
be entirely deprived of his property by the powerful
and unscrupulous. It is a good bill to kill, and any
party that supports it should die with it.
THE STATUS OF HAWAII.
A BILL is before Congress to erect a territory in
Hawaii. Under our system of government,
and by unbroken precedent, when the terri
torial status is reached the further advance to state
hood is made possible. Only California and Texas
of the States admitted into the Union were exempted
from a territorial novitiate.
The modern school of expansionists holds, backed
by some judicial decisions, that the constitution does
not apply to Territories, and that they may be ruled
by Congress as it chooses, suspending the bill of
rights and all the constitutional guarantees within
them, if it so elect.
The first issue presented is, Do the American peo
ple want Hawaii as a Territory and therefore a pros
pective State? The revolution occurred seven years
ago. Since then there has surely been uninterrupted
access to the islands for all Americans who chose to
go and preferred to stay. The latest official state
ment of the present population gives returns of the
nationalities in Hawaii:
Japanese coolies 40,000
Chinese coollea 21,600
Hawallans 8,400
Hawaiian part castes â
Portuguese 15,100
Americans 3,000
British 2,200
German 1,400
French and Norwegian 479
All others 1,055
Total 124,234
It is safe to assume that if the islands were suited
to Americans they would be there. The foundation
of the population of the United States is our Ameri
can laboring people. No American State can be
built and perpetuated without them. As The Call
warned the annexationists, American labor cannot
live and work in Hawaii. If there is to be commer
cial prosperity there Us foundation is fixed by the cli
mate and its Asiatic coolie labor. It will be seen
that already 61,000 coolies are domesticated there.
More than ever before in the history of the country.
Of the three thousand Americans none are laborers.
The exceeding prosperity existing there during the
last year has its sole cause in the productive power
of 61,000 servile Asiatic coolie laborers. The next
largest class is the Portuguese, themselves resistant
to the climate to a less degree than the coolies, and
most of them there on contract like the coolies. The
British and Germans are there on business, picking
such crumbs as fall from the tables of the 3000 Amer
icans. We submit that there is not the material for
an American State, nor for an American Territory.
New Mexico. has been held out of the Union because
a majority of her people are of Mexican blood and
do not speak English, rendering the use of Spanish
necessary in judicial proceedings. Thomas H. Ben
ton, the great Missouri Senator, could write as good
English as a professor, but his extempore speeches
were full of grammatical lapses. One day he and
Pierre Soule of Louisiana and a group of Senators
were discussing the French republic of '48. Bcnton
declared that it would live but briefly, for only people
speaking the English language could exist under re
publican government. Soule replied: "It is fortu
nate for you that your theory is false." The joke was
on Bcnton, but his theory has been applied to New
Mexico.
In Hawaii it is a question of race and adaptation to
the climate. American workingmen want to know
whether Congress proposes to erect there an indefi
nitely continuing Territory, governed by its will, and
excluded from the operation of the labor laws of this
country. â¢ They want to know whether the erection
of a Territory is to cloak a continuation there of
labor under a penal contract. They want to know
whether the products of coolie servile labor are to
have free access to this market in competition with
the products of American labor paid on the white
scale of wages.
They are not to be deceived, for they know that
just in proportion as such products displace theirs
their labor is displaced and left without wages. As
we have said, we repeat, that if Hawaii is brought
under the economic as well as the political jurisdiction
of the United States its coolie labor must go, and all
of its contract labor, coolie or Portuguese or native,
must cease. Like the former prosperity of Hayti
and Jamaica, that of Hawaii is based on servile
labor. It is that form of involuntary servitude which
h forbidden by the constitution of the United States.
When it ceases the prosperity of Hawaii ceases, like
that of Jamaica and Hayti. Its economic history and
fate will be that of all tropical possessions held by
temperate zone nations, for never anywhere have they
produced a significant commercial surplus except by
forced and servile labor. We advise the representa
tives of California to consider these things well when
they act upon the status of Hawaii. The organic act
creating there a Territory should be American. It
can be so only by immediately banishing all coolie
labor and permanently excluding it, and by making a
labor contract a felony. It will be less trouble to
recognize this now than to suffer for refusal later on.
The Call has warned the people from the begin
ning. Our warning to the annexationists in Hawaii
was not lacking. Coolie labor was the contract goose
that laid their golden eggs. Their hope was to in
fluence this Government to erect in the islands an un-
American American jurisdiction.. To prove this let
some one offer a coolie excluding amendment to the
territorial bill, and the Hawaiian opposition will dis
close the direction of the trade wind in the islands.

Friendship of America

ONLY ONE STUMBLING BLOCK
MEAT INSPECTION QUESTION IS
YET UNSOLVED.
Emtassador White Hopeful That Me
Kinley's Proposition for a Joint
Commission Will Be
Accepted.
?
Copyrlghted, 1900, by the Associated Press
BERLIN, Jan. 13.â The correspondent of
the Associated Press interviewed United
States Embassador White to-day about
the present status of the relations be
tween Germany and the United States.
White said:
The Samoan question between the United
States and Germany, the Insurance question
and sundry minor matters have been happily
settled. The main questions which remain are
the commercial treaty and the proper Inspec
tion of American meats. The former will bo
mainly considered at Washington. The latter
must depend upon the action of the Relchs-
U(f. Though the Agrarian party shows bitter
hostility to the alleviation of the present ar
rangements, so oppressive to American Inter
ests, it Is hoped that the proposal made In
President McKlnley's message for the appolnt-
merit of a special commission may be accepted.
There Is no doubt that the Government, apart
from the Agrarians, would b* heartily glad to
see some such fair settlement. This was fore
shadowed when the Emperor expressed at con
siderable length to mo on New Year's day not
only hla own personal satisfaction but that of
the German people at the part of the message
referring to Ormany. It Is also an open secret
that Prince Hohenlohe and Count yon Hulow
were especially anxious to see some such Just
solution of this most troublesome of all the
questions now pending between the two Gov
ernments.
Politically the week was interesting In
several respects. The Reichstag was
dull, but In the coming week foreign af
fairs will be thoroughly discussed. Count
yon Bulow. Minister of Foreign Affairs,
the Associated Press correspondent is in
formed, will review recent events and fur
nish some inside information.
In the Diet the Government's complete
moral defeat during the debate on the dis
missal of political officials for voting
against the canal bill is considered to be
of great importance in Internal politics,
as it shows that the Conservatives still
intend to bitterly oppose the Emperor,
especially on the new canal bill, which
does not please the Agrarians, in spite of
the fact that It contains enormous im
provement projects for the eastern prov
inces of Prussia.
The seizures of German steamers by
British ships have had the effect of in
tensifying and generalizing anti-British
sentiment in Germany. It would be diffi
cult to-day to find a German, here or any
where, who dares to profess Anglophlllsm.
All the anti-German utterances in the
British press are circulated here. One
which causes great embitterment 13 a
Punch poem starting. "Little Germany
talks," which is reprinted everywhere.
In reference to this the semi-official Post
says to-day:
"It must be said that this is an unusu
ally impudent piece of impudence, ~oy the
same English who did not know how tÂ«
flatter our Emperor enough when the
question was to prevent his abandoning
the idea of his visit to England."

THE FRUIT-GROWERS' CONVENTION.
rROM the convention of fruit-growers which is
to assemble in San Jose this week much is to
be expected. The delegates are to meet for a
specific and well-defined purpose, that of providing
a system of co-operation in marketing deciduous and
dried fruits, and the results arc therefore likely to be
more important than those which follow conventions
whose discussions cover the whole field of horticul
ture and its products,
The circumstances of the time are propitious to the
efforts of those who are seeking to bring about the
formation of some system of union among the grow
ers. The controversy now going on in the south
between the growers of citrus fruits and the railroads
has a significance which the producers of deciduous
fruits can hardly overlook. In the situation which
confronts the orange-growers there is a warning for
all California orchardists too plain to be mistaken,
and that warning, added to the lessons the fresh fruit
and dried fruit producers have learned from their own
experience in the past, will do much to induce the
most conservative among them to undertake the es
tablishment of some system of mutual protection and
advantage.
Fortunately there are circumstances of encourage
ment as well as of warning in the environment. The
success which has been attained by the Raisin-
Growers' Union is sufficient to give something of
hope to even the least sanguine. It is well known
that shortly before the organization of the raisin
growers for co-operative purposes the industry was
rendered almost unprofitable by reason of the com
petition among the growers and the ill-regulated
method of marketing the crops. Since the beginning
of co-operation the situation has been changed for
the better in every respect, and the prospects justify
the expectation of greater good to come.
All the economic forces of our time and country
tend to the development ofi the spirit and the prac
tice of co-operation. There may be some industries
that can be maintained profitably along the old lines
in spite of those forces; but it has now become evi
dent that fruit-growing in California is not one of
them. Owing to the distance of our growers from
the great markets of the East and of Europe, the pro
ducer is exposed to the rapacity of the transportation
companies, and afterward to the mismanagement or
worse of the commission men.-
The double evil cannotSbe successfully combated
by individual fruit-grower*. It will require the
united efforts of all to accomplish the full measure

perative urgency. The task of organizing a union
among so many persons is difficult, but it is not im
possible. Fortunately fruit-growing in California is
in the hands of men of wide experience and a high
degree of intelligence. Many of them have been suc
cessful managers of other lines of business before
they became fruit-growers. They are therefore fully
equal to the work before them, and it will be their,
own fault if something be not done at this convention

Golden will have a fund of new laugh

On the theory "that seeing Is believing."
John A. Smith of Milwaukee wsnta everyone
to try his remedy for the cure of rheumatism
at his expense. For that reason he proposes
to distribute 25,000 free sample packages among
all persons sending him their address. Mr.
Smith had suffered all the agony and torture
from rheumatism, tried all tha remedies known
and yet utterly failed to find relief.
At times he was so helpless that he had to
take to morphine and after considerable doctor-
ing he gave up in despair. He began studying
into the dunes of rheumatism and after much
experimenting he finally hit upon a combina-
tion of drugs which completely cured him.
The result was so beneficial to his entire sys-
tem that he called hiÂ« new found remedy
"Gloria Tonic." Those of his friends and
relatives and neighbors suffering from rheu-
matism were next cured and Mr. Smith con-
cluded to offer hla remedy to the world. But
he found the task a difficult one, as nearly
everybody had tried a hundred or more reme-
dies and they couldn't be made to believe that
there "was such a thing as a cure for rheu-
matism. But an old gentleman from Segutn.
Texas, wrote him saying if Mr. Smith would
send him a sample he would try it. but as
he had suffered forty-one years and wasted a
fortune with doctors and advertised remedies
he wouldn't buy anything more until he knew
it was worth something. The sample was
sent, he purchased more and the result was
astonishing. He was completely cured. ThlÂ«

Mignon is 13 years old, a blgr, romp

their voices when they speak of her
and call down a blessing on her sun

A prodigy Is a youthful , con

for a brief moment and then splutters
out. Emma Nevada's daughter is a
wonderfully gifted creature, healthy
both in mind and body, who sings be
cause melody is in her and writes be
cause her soul is overflowing with
poetry. She is as unconscious of her
rare gifts as is a flower of its beauty.
She is full of vigorous life; she Is a
genius.
Little Mignon does all things well.
Her mind knows no mediocrity. She
paints, she models, she writes and she
sings. Those who have heard her sing

artist as the world has never known.
Those who have read her stories stand
in wonderment before the output of the
child's mind.
Mme. Nevada says: "My child shall
be a singer and the world will stand
still to listen to her." Dr. Palmer, the
child's happy father, says: "Our
daughter Is a genius." Little Mignon
herself says: "I love to sing and oh,
I love to write â sad tales that make
you creep and want to cryâ and I lovÂ«
to typewrite."

9SO Broadway, Jan. 13.
Mills College welcomed back to-day un
ostentatiously but heartily one of its
greatest alumnae, Mme. Emma Nevada,
the prima donna. It was the homecoming
of the great singer, who, with the memory
of great ovations still with her, felt, as
she said, the keenest delight in viewing
again the scer.es of those happy school
yt-ars and in meeting once more the old
est and truest friends of her life. The sim
plicity of the reception made the return
doubly delightful. Mme. Nevada, ac
companied by her little daughter, Mignon,
her husband. Dr. Palmer, Miss Mignon's
governess and a faithful servant of many
years, was driven up the avenue to the
college doors. And when Mme. Nevada
alighted it was to be greeted by Just such
a bevy of girls in cap and gown as she
had once known there, by the old white
a.r.d gold of the college colors, by a pro
fusion of marguerites, the college flower,
and lastly by her old friend who has
watched with so much pride the school
girl grow to the renowned songstress-
Mrs. Mills herself.
The college, doors swung open to the
ring of the familiar yell and the diva as
she entered the reception rooms could
scarcely see the decorations put there for
her eye for the tears that her emotions
called forth. Then for an hour, standing
beside Mrs. Mills, she met the girl stu
dents who crowded around to greet her
and for each she had some little thought
prettily expressed.
The assembly hall was the scene of the
reception, which was followed by a brief
address by Mme. Nevada. It was an Im
promptu speech, the singer not having
planned to cay or sing anything. Bhe re
viewed, by request, her visit to Victoria,
to the Queen of Spain and the scene when
because she was an American ehe was
hissed in a Spanish theater. In closing
she pointed out to her hearers the value
of making the most of their present op
portunities and of keeping always in after
life to the high standard set by the college
and its honored head. She sang for the
girls, too. First a bit from some, opera,
and then "Listen to the Mocking Bird,"
the song that she had sung in the Fame
room when she was a student and the
stage was a dream of the future. Her
voice was not new to her audience, for.
with the exception of eight girls, all had
heard hrr the day before, when over 150
young ladies went from the college to San
Francisco as her guests at the Friday
afternoon concert. After an enthusiastic
round of applause Miss Mignon was al
lowed to sing, choosing the "Swaneo
River." the college girls Joining In the
chorus,
Mme. Nevada recited some verses and
read a little original story, "Sweet Vio
lets," which she had dedicated to Mrs.
Mills. All sang "America" then aud
"Home. Sweet Home."
Luncheon followed and was partaken of
In a dining-room bright with college
pendants. Luncheon ilnlshed, Madame
Nevada, tired with her trip and the ex
citement of the morning, retired to Mis.
Mills' private Bittfng-room, where she
ratted and talked with her old friend.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the students
lined the hallways as Madame Nevada en
terea a carriage and gave the college yell
as a farewell. There were flowers in
abundance, and the pendants were brave
ly swung. At the little station the se
r.iors, in their mortar boards and flowing
robes, gathered and gave the final good

view with her former class and room
mate, Mr?. W. E. Sharon.

At One Dollar per share stock in either the California Standard
Oil Company or Giant Oil Company can now be secured. Control-
ling, as they do. 1300 acres patented land in the heart of the McKit-
trick district, and their first well producing 150 barrels per day, with
a record of over 250 barrels under increased pumping pressure with-
out apparent dimir.ishment of the supply, the directors will now
oner a limited number of shares at the above price, the money thus
received to be expended in further development. The California
Standard and Giant Companies are fully equipped with all necessary
machinery, having three Standard rigs of their own, oil and water
pipes, and immense storage tanks directly at the depot. Twenty-two
men are employed on the three new wells, which are now down close
to the Oil Sand, and, with others being drilled, it is safe to say the
production will soon rival that of the largest companies in the State.
WE MEAN WHAT WE SAYâ only a limited amount of stock will
be sold at $1.00 per share. Permits to inspect the wells and prop-
erty of the company can be had at any time. Daily trains commence

GENERAL JOUBERT A
SKILLED TACTICIAN
Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted. 1900, by James Gordon

LONDON, Jan. 13,â A German officer,
talking to me to-day on Boer tactics
especially those conducted by General
Joubert, said: "Joubert Is a skilled mod
ern tactician, deriving the best of his
schemes from Yon Moltke, of whom he
Is an ardent admirer and with all of
whose writings he Is thoroughly conver
sant.
The attacking forces," he said, "around
Ladysmith, Mafeklng and Klmberley aro
placed according to Yon Moltke"s most ap
proved ideas, on three sides, which is. to
day reckoned the best method and surest
means of investing with the smallest num
ber of troops. Those were the means
adopted both at Koniggrapz and Sedan.
As to German officers they have done
nothing In a technical way, their efforts
being entirely confined to the artillery,
which has practically taken no hand In
tactics. .
"Joubert could give points almost to
any member of the Krieg Academle. "Were
he in the German army to-day he would
stand In point of knowledge in the high
est position."

Ambulance Corps Under Fire at the Battle of Willow
20
LOXDOX, Jan. 14.â The
excitement here has again
reached the boiling point.
What is going on in the neigh
borhood of the Tugela? How is
Buller faring? Has another bat
tle been fought, or is it going
on? These are questions that
are being asked.
We know nothing more than
was reported in the official dis
patch of yesterday, that the pont
at Potgieters Drift had been
seized by Buller's men. While
that little bit of news has had a
very cheering effect here, every
body is terribly anxious. All
know very well that if a big fight
is not going on the combatants
must be on the eve of what * will
surely be a much more stubborn
battle than the last. But the
press censor is keeping every
thing back, whatever that may
be, not a line from any source
having come through.
Meanwhile, of course, military
men are talking and examining
maps in clubs and discussing
what General Buller may be do
ing, or what he ought to do, and
so forth. The military expert of
the Westminister Gazette, who
viding his forces more than is
absolutely necessary. When the
news comes, therefore, it will
surely be of an attack either at
the Drift or Colenso."
From Cape Colcmy comes an
interesting little bit of news re

FRIED ONIONS
Indirectly Caused the Death of the
World's Greatest GreneraL
Jt ib a matter or history that Napoleon
Â¦was a gourmand, an Inordinate lover of
tho pood thlnps of the table, and history
further records that his favorite dish was
fried onions: his death from cancer of
stomach, it Is claimed also, was probably
caused from his excessive Indulgence of
this fondness for the odorous vegetable.
The onion Is undoubtedly a whole-
rome article of food. In fact has many
medicinal qualities of value, but It would
be difficult to find a more Indigestible ar-
ticle than fried onions, and to many peo-
ple they are simply poison; but the onion
does not stand alone In this respect. Any
article of food that is not thoroughly di-
tested becomes a source of disease and
discomfort whether It be fried onions or
beefsteak.
The reason why any wholesome food Is
not promptly digested is because the
ftomach lacks some Important element of
digestion, some stomachs lack peptone,
others are deficient in gastric Juice. Btlll
others lack hydrochloric acid.
The one thing necessary to do In any
ease of poor dlgestlcn Is to supply those
elements of digestion which the stomach
lacks, and nothing does this co thorough-
ly and safely as Stuart'g I>yspepsla. Tab-
lets.
Dr. Richardson In writing a thesis on
treatment of dyspepsia and Indigestion
closes his remarks by saying: "For those
suffering from acid dyspepsia, shown by
pour, watery risings, or for flatulent dys-
pepsia shown by gas on stomach, causing
heart trouble and difficult breathing, as
â¢well as for all other forms of stomach
trouble, the safest treatment Is to take
cne or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each meal. I advise them because
they contain no harmful drugs, but are
composed of valuable digestives, which
act promptly cpon the food eaten. I never
knew a case of Indigestion or even chronic
dyspepsia which Stuart 1 * Tablet* would
rot reach."
Cheap cathartic medicines claiming to
cure dyspepsia and Indigestion can have no
*ffect whatever In actively digesting tho
Xood and to call any cathartic medicine a
cure for Indigestion Is a misnomer
Every druggist In the Unted States and
Canada sells Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and they are not only the safest and most
successful but the most scientific of any
treatment for Indigestion and stomach

is considered among military
readers as one of the shrewdest
now writing for the press, re
marks: "The distance from Co-
Lenso to Potgieters Drift is about
twenty miles. The country is
rough and intricate, and conse
quently the Boers, with all their
mobility, will find difficulty in
rapidly transferring their forces
to meet the British attack, as not
till the last minute will they be
able to know whether Buller is
counting on crossing at Potgiet
ers Drift or at Colenso itself.
"It will be remembered how,
at the battle of Colenso, after
Hart was repulsed, Boers were
seen galloping to westward to
make up a party for fighting
against Hilyard's brigade. Noth
ing of the sort can happen here.
Should the British attack at
either Potgieters Drift or Colen
so fail those who have resisted it
will have little chance of inter
vening on their flank, as surely
Buller is connected with General
Clery at Chieveley by means of
field telepraph, and both attacks
will synchronize.
"It is remarked in some quar
ters that Buller can be only mak
ing a feint of Potgieters Drift
and that the real attack may be
to the eastward. But this is most
unlikely. .It would mean subdi-
ported that the Boers tried to
drive French's men off, but were
beaten off.
The great event here yester
day was the departure of Lon
don's first contingent of volun
teers for the war. London went
mad over her citizen soldiers on
Friday night, but yesterday
morning the excitement reached
a tremendous pitch. Compara
tively early as was the hour
of march of the gallant
was destroyed and ranks were
broken up. Comrades lost each
other in the bustle. Belts broke
adrift and khaki coats were torn.
Men had to make the best of
their way individually or suffer
themselves to be carried on the
shoulders of their admirers right
to the station, where in the
course of time â one, two and
nearly three hours lateâ they ar
rived in detachments.
It was only the band of the
Queen's Westminsters which
contrived to keep together, and
when they got to the station,
playing selections from "The
Belle of New York," they found
they had played to a contingent
of one man only. The rest were
in the hands of the crowd or
coming to the station inside or
on top of hansoms. London has
never known such a morning. ;

TOD SLOAN IN
TOWN AGAIN ON
PLEASURE BENT
Here With "Skeets"
Martin.
NEITHER EXPECTS TO RIDE
Two of the bright particular stars of the
racing firmament dawned on the local
horizon last night, when Jockeys J. Tod
Sloan and J. 11. ("Skeets") Martin arrived
on the evening overland from New York.
Mr. Martin is accompanied by his wife,
and the whole party is here merely on a
pleasure trip.
When seen last night Sloan had consid
erable to say concerning things in general
but little concerning his own plans beyond
stating that he had come out here for rest
and recreation and would in all proba
bility do no riding while on the coast
"I may take a mount or two," he said
but it's a hundred to one I won't. I am
going back to England in a couple of
months or so, and will ride as 1 did be
foreâattached to no particular stable
They have treated me well abroad, and I
like the game there so well that I want
some more of it."
Sloan was asked his opinion about start-
Ing in England as compared with starting
in America, and gave it most emphatically
It was neither complimentary to American
starters nor to American starting gates
He said that the English starter was a
gentleman in every sense of the word and
perfectly honest. In his opinion, the
American starter was neither polite nor
square, as a rule.
"When an English starter tells you a
thing you can depend upon it," said he
"He is perfectly honest. Neither does he
THREATENED RISING

for the Transvaal.
MONTREAL. Quebec. Jan. IXâ There Is
fear of the Canadian Indians in tho north
west rising owing to the withdrawal of
some of the mounted police for the Trans
vaal. The condition is considered serious.
Clifford Sifton. Minister of the Interior,
and the Commissioner have telegTapheii
to the Indian agents to warn the Indiana
that misconduct on their part will mean a
stoppage of the Government bounty and
any outbreak will be suppressed by force.
The white men and halfbreeda who havo
been doing their best to foment troubla
will be made to leave the country-
The Department of the Interior was In
formed by cipher telesram that a serious
state of affairs exists in the northern por
tions of Assinaboine and Alberta, afons
the Saskatchewan. The Indians of tha
northern districts, principally the Cree3.
it appears, have been taking great Interest
in the South African war and have been
most anxious to get every scrap of news
concerning it.
At first their anxiety to pet news seemed
to be merely that cf members of a fight
ing race who took an interest in any
trouble anywhere, but within a fortnight
affairs have taken on a dangerous aspect.
White men. adventurers of a most unde
sirable type, have been tellinjr the Crees
that the British Government Is dolnsr ex
actly what the Indians believe the Cana
dian Government did in ISSSâ that is. at
tempting to steal from the Boers the lands
upon which their fathers lived ar.d which
belong to them just as much as in the
belief of the Cree braves of a decade and
a half ago the whole Northwest belonged
to the red men. The Indian agents and
the mounted police have found the Crees
to be excited by these tales and in some
cases the agents have gone to the trouble
of tryinar to counteract the reports by
getting the aborigines together.

Compromise Is Promised on a Basis
of Two Hundred Dollars
Per Month for
Deputies.
School Director Denman says that tha
controversy over deputies' salaries be
tween the Board of Education and Su
perintendent Webster has been compro
mised. Superintendent Webster says tt
has not, and there the matter stands.
The proposition was discussed at a "dark
lantern meeting" held on Friday, but no
agreement was reached. In fact, noth
ing resulted save a merry little row,
which brought on a premature adjourn
ment.
None of the Directors present at thÂ«
meeting was inclined to allow the depu
ties J2OO a month, the sum demanded by
Webster. Each had a figure of his own.
and his reason for having it and every
reason was emphatically set forth beforÂ©
the meeting was over. Director Casserly
said that no deputy should receive over
J2IQO per year. He declared that a de
mand for $2000 was preposterous, as that
was as large a salary as the Directors
themselves receive. Denman wanted to
allow but SIM per month, and Mrs. Kln
caid held out for the same figure. Presi
dent Mark was willing to allow SC4OO per
year, and after some argument Casaerly
agreed with him.
Superintendent Webster said he was
willing to compromise on that fisrure if
he could do no better, but that he pro
posed to keep up tho fight. Mr. Web
ster's ideas are indorsed by ex-President
Bergerot and moat of the teachers in thÂ»
department, and jr.st now the matter la
being givtn more discussion among tha
teachers than anything that ha 3 cropped
ud for some months.
CLOSE CULL FOR
A BARK 0N THE
POTATO PITCH
The Ferris Thompson
Nearly Wrecked.
ANCHORED IN THE BREAKERS
*
TOWI2) INTO SAFETY BY THE
STEAMZB, HOMER.
Old Barkentine Jane A. Falkenburg
"Will Again Be Put in Commis
sion â Percy Baker At
tempts Suicide.
The old bark Ferris R. Thompson
xrourd up the unluckiest voyaga she has
ever made since she was built, in 1574,
by going on the "potato patch" while
making port early yesterday morning.
Luckily the steamer Homer, bound in
from San Pedro, saw her predicament and
went to her assistance. The big hawser
that was put aboard the Thompson part
ed twice before she was finally got away
Irom her dangerous position. As it was
Ehe was considerably strained and lost
en anchor ar.d chain.
The Ferris S. Thompson left here on Oc
tober 8 in. company with the schooner
American GirL It took the bark sixty-one
days to get to Port Blakeley, while the
American Girl has never been heard from.
Both vessels were caught !n the terrible
southeaster that raged aJong the ccast
for nearly two months and it was only
t^tcr enduring great hardships that the
crew of the Thompson got their vessel
into Puget Sound. When the Thompson
left here she was under charter to go
to Port Discovery and bring back a con
signment of telegraph poles for the West
ern Union Company. The number of poies
â¢was not stated, but a lump sum was to be
paid tor the freignt. When Captain Murk
got to Port Discovery he found enough
poles awaiting him to load the Thomy
eon three times over. He told the Western
Union Company's agent that he could not
carry all the timbers and the agent an
ewered, "All right, take what you can
ar.d come back icr the remainder."
This arrangement did not suit the cap
tain, as the charter money would bareiy
pay for the round trip. He accordingly
r<r{usifd to take any of the telegraph poies
end went to Port Blakeley to load lum
ber. The Western Union Company is now
trying to charter another vessel to bring
tiown the poles and the chances are tho
old bark will be libeled for any loss the
telegraph company may sustain over and
above the charter price. After getting her
load aboard at Port Blakeley tne Thomp
son tailed for San Francisco on Christ
mas cay. She had over oOO.t/.'y feet of lum
ber aboard and, meeting with contrary
â¢winds, made a siow passage. Friday night
ehe was off the heads and Captain Murk
etood on and off wailing for daylight.
Durir.s the pre\"alence of the heavy fog
In the morr.ir.g the fc-ark got too close in
and was on the "potato patch" before the
captala and crew were aware cf it. The
anchor was dropped, but the bark was in
a very dangerous position, as the bar was
exceedingly rough and the rollers were
breaking all over the "patch." Finally
the Homer, from San Pedro, came along
and at the third attempt got the Thomp
ton on* and brought htr into port. Alter
discharging her cargo the Thompson will
go on the clrydock for an overhauling.
The old bark took exaclly three months
ii.'.vi live days to make the run to the
{sound and home again.

Oliver Smith Graphically Describes
How He Was Held Up.
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.â Oliver Smith - of
COt Twelfth street was held up by a lone
highwayman, who was masked and
armed, to-night. Tho crime was com
mitted within two blocks ot Washington
street, and at a time when there were
many people abroad.
The victim was on his way home when
the robber stenped out from a doorway
and thrust the weapon under his nose.
"Throw up your hands," commanded
the highwayman. Smith quickly com
piled and was relieved of $3. He was then
told to walk on and not look back. Tho
footpad then disappeared.
Smith notified the police shortly after

to work. Chief Hodgkins-is inclined to
discredit the story, and thinks that

and widow No. 2 Is here. Mahe is well

Ihe woman who has lived in this city
with Dr. Mahe, posing as his wife, and
who has been prostrated with grief at his
death, to-day admitted to City Clerk Sel
zer that fhe was not a lawful wife. At
first she was very indignant, but when
shown a telegram from the San Francisco
widow demanding the body she broke
down and confessed. She refused to tell
her true name, but admite that she ran
away from San Francisco with the doctor
and had been living with him for several
months.

Sloan speaks in highest terms of the
treatment that was accorded him in the
old country. He is deeply Interested tn
the outcome of the war in the Transvaal,
and says his sympathy is with England
and that he hopes the British will win.
"I know nothing of the merits of the con
troversy," said he, "but the English peo
ple treated me right and I hope they will
win. There was a great deal of gloom
In England when I left. Music hnlls,
theaters and all places of amusement
were practically closed, and the mourn

THERE was a. head-on collision last
evening at the siding a little beyond
Colma between the southbound San
Jose local passenger train and a
light engine, which seems to have come
from nowhere and gone to the same place,
according to the railroad version of the
smash-up. The passenger engine was
wrecked and the tender telescoped with
the baggage car. The light locomotive
was not damaged, and after mixing things
with the local train backed away from
the wreck on its own account and started
in the direction of San Jose without wait
ing for its crew. That the accident did
not result in an appalling list of casual
ties appears to be marvelous. Passengers
were severely shaken up and thrown from
their seats, but aside from a few slight
bruises no one was seriously injured. The
engineers and firemen of the engines
caved themselves by Jumping as soon as
they caw that a collision was inevitable.
The accident occurred near Cypress
Lawn Cemetery, at a point where a sharp
curve in the road obstructs a clear view
of the track. The passenger train had
left Colma and had gained considerable
headway when tho light engine appeared
around the curve scarcely fifty yards
ahead, rushing along as though it was In
a hurry. Both engineers reversed their
engines, but the man at the throttle of
the light engine forgot to shut off steam
or apply the air brake in his haste to
lump from the cab to a place of safety.
A moment later the two engines went
together with a crash. The light engine
seemed to rebound and at once started
off down the track In the direction of San
ENGINES WRECKED IN A COLLISION NEAR COLMA.
Jose without either engineer or fireman.
So far as the railroad officials are In
formed the engine Is still going.
The passenger engine was badly
smashed, although it did not leave the
rails. Its tender telescoped with the bag
gage car. The shock was so severe that
passengers were thrown from their seats
and subjected to a severe shaking up. As
near as can be learned no one was seri
ously hurt. It is stated that as soon as
the accident occurred the crew of the light
engine started across the fields on a run,
fearing rough handling by the passengers.
The San Jose train had the right of way.
and no explanation is gi\en for the other
engine being on the line.
A wrecking train was sent to the scene
of the disaster and the track was cleared
in time to prevent any great delay in the
later trains. The smashed engine and bag
gage car were hauled to the siding near
the cemetery. The passengers on the dis
abled train were transferred to the Mon
terey express, on which they continued
their Journey.
Inquiry at the railroad offices elicited no
Information as to the cause of the colli
sion. The officials stated that they did
not know where the light engine had come
from, where it had gone or who had
charge of It.

SOCIETYPETER C. ALLEN.
-
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.â The engage
ment of Miss Florence Sharon,
the beautiful daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. W. E. Sharon of Pied
mont, to Peter C. Allen, the
young composer, was announced to
night by Madame Emma Nevada at a
dinner given in honor of the talented
opera singer at the Sharon residence.
The engagement, like the dinner, is
one of the most important social
events of the year in Oakland. No
young lady In local society is, morÂ«
prominent or more popular than Miss
Sharon, and Mr. Allen, since his re
turn to this city, has won many
friends for himself, as well as an en
viable reputation among musical peo
ple for his compositions .and orches
trations. The news, therefore, of the
betrothal will be read with much in
terest by society here and in San
Francisco, where Miss Sharon Is
prominent, by society in Washington,
where the dainty Californlan made
hundreds of admiring friends, and by
musical people all over the West, who
know of the splendid voice of the
bride-to-be and of the art which Mr.
Allen has well mastered.
To those seated about the dinner
table to-night the engagement was
not a surprise, for Miss Sharon's
nearest friends have long rightly
guessed that the announcement would
soon be forthcoming. Madame Neva
da, as an old friend of Mrs. Sharon
and as the guest of honor at the din
ner, was chosen by the hostess to tell
the pleasant news, and the guests de
lightfully added their congratulations.
The table, in compliment to the tal
ented singer, was decorated in white
and gold, the Mills College colors,
roses being used.

TWO ACRES OF LAND
SUDDENLY ELEVATED
Remarkable Phenomenon at Pesca
dero Probably Caused by Explo
sion of Subterranean Gases.
SANTA CRUZ. Jan. 13.â A remarkable
phenomenon occurred on Pescadero Creek
at 11 o'clock last night, when nearly two
acres of ground covered thickly with red
wood trees and including a section of the
creek raised up bodily from ten to fifteen
feet above the surrounding surface. The
upheaval was accompanied by a heavy
rumbling sound and is supposed to be an
earthquake. A long section of the wagon
road was elevated in the air and de
stroyed. The elevation of a portion of the
creek bottom changed the course of the
stream, which had cut a wide now chan
nel around the upraised ground. Much
of the timber had been prostrated, while
all that is left standing leans heavily to
ward tho higher ground. Many dead fish
were found. As there are oil indications
in the vicinity the upheaval may have
been caused by a gas explosion in the
depths below.
RICH PLATINUM DEPOSIT.
Frank Launtz Discovers a Valuable
Mine in the North.
Sr*cla.l Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY. Jan. 13.â Frank R. Launtz,
a Monterey man, who has spent the past
three years prospecting in the Canada and
Alaska mining regions in the Interest of
the St. Louis Mining and Development
Company of St. Louis, Mo., has Just re
turned home with news of a most re
markable as well as extremely valuable
find. While in the Copper River district
of Alaska, near Mount Drumm, he cama
upon an exceedingly rich platinum de
posit, which at the surface yields $13 to the
ton, at three and a half feet the yield is
$18,000 to the ton and at six feet it is $30.
000 to the ton.
The manner of the find was peculiar.
Launtz noticed a serpentine rock forma
tion about fifteen miles from the base of a
glacier, and following it up to the glacier
he there found water and black sand
coursing from under the ice and falling
into a canyon, down which it flowed for
about fourteen miles, and then emptied
into the Copper River. The black sand
was spread over the floor of the canyon,
and varied in width from 600 to 700 feet.
This sand Launtz found to be very rich
in metal deposits, containing besides the
larger percentage of platinum, iridium,
rhodium, palladium and osmium, metals
usually found with platinum. He thor
oughly prospected the sand, sinking a
sixty-foot shaft and finding no sign of
bedrock, and the deeper he went the
greater percentage of platinum he found.
Forty claims were staked out and located
by Launtz and those with him, fourteen
of which Launtz took up for the St. Louis
Mining and Development Company, of
which he is a member. The forty claims
cover the whole deposit, it is stated.
Launtz then went to St. Louis to make
his report and to arrange for sending ap
paratus and supplies for working the
mine. He will leave here about the mid
dle of February for his return to Alaska,
and will at 'once begin the work of devel
oping his valuable discovery. As the
world's supply of platinum at present i 3
comparatively small and as 90 per cent of
that comes from the Ural Mountain's of
Russia, a mine as rich as Launtz reports
this to be will certainly make the for
tunes of those who own It.

WEAVING A WEB
AROUND THREE
MEN SUSPECTED
Police Believe They
Have the Hold-Ups.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 13.
The police feel confident that in the cap
ture of the three suspects at an early hour
yesterday morning tney secured the trio
of desperadoes wno have been terorizinn
the people of Oakland for the past four or
five months. Chief of Police HodgKins
stated to-night that the officers are grad
ually forging a chain of circumstantial
evidence around the prisoners which will
soon be complete enough to warrant a
charge of highway robbery being pre
ferred against the men.
William Dannaker, William Dowling
and James McCoy, the fellows who are
now in the tanks, were again put through
a searching cross-examination to-day, but
they still maintain their stolid reticencts
and no damaging admissions were eltcite<l
from them. The investigation on the out
side was more prolific of results, however,
and the police now have in their custody
three masks, two revolvers and a pair of
stolen shoes which they assert beiong to
the men now locked up. One of the weap
ons was found yesterday shortly after tho
prisoners were captured. The balance oi
the things were procured to-day.
"The masks were found in Dannaker'*
house,"' said Chief Hodgkins, "and the
revolver was discovered in the lot where
the prisoners were hiding when Patrolmen
Sherry and McSorley, Special Officer C.
T. Ford and Deputy Constable William
Moffatt captured them.
"We found the shoes hidden under a
culvert close by. I cannot say, for obvious
reasons. Just what other evidence has
been procured, but I will state, however,
that we have got one case against tha
men nearly completed, and in a few days
we will be able to take them into court
on a definite charge of felony."
When the prisoners were arrested a
black cap and a piece of candle were
found on one of them. Dannaker lives at
615 Sixth street, which is just opposite
the residence of Robert Vincent, tha
butcher who was shot by footpads sev
eral weeks ago. That job was done by
highwaymen who were evidently ac
quainted with the movements of their vic
tim, and an attempt was made to bur
glarize his store last Thursday night.
A rumor reached police headquarters
this afternoon to the effect that three.
masked men had sandbagged and robbed
a man out on San Pablo avenue, near tho
streetcar company's power-house, last
Sunday night. Ti.e story was vague and
failed to show who the victim was. Chief
of Police Hodgkins detailed a couple of
officers to investigate the matter, but they
were unable to procure any Information.
"The 'story Is without foundation." de
clared the Chief, "and I am paying nr>
attention to it. Since the hold-ups hetran
we have been flooded with stories of rob
beries which have had no foundation."

JUDGE'S PECULIAR ERROR.
Special Dispatch to The Call
TOMALES. Jan. 11â S. A. Marshall, the
young man who figured in San Rafael
some time ago .as the star actor in a
pump gun test case, is again appearing as
the principal in a case of the same kind,
but which incidentally Involves a tangle
which will give legal experts food for
thought.
Marshall and his attorney, Charles
Wheeler, arrived here to-day, and Mar
shall went hunting with a proscribed
pump-gun. Wheeler thereupon swore out
a warrant for his arrest on the charge of
violating a county ordinance, to wit,
using a repeating shotgun.
Marshall was brought before Jud^e
Turner and sentenced to paya $20 fine or
serve twenty days. Then Wheeler peti
tioned the Judge that Marshall bÂ» re
leased on his own recognizance pending
habeas corpus proceedings, for which he
was about to swear out a writ in the Su
preme Court. Judge Turner turned Mar
shall loose and, what is more remarkable,
without suspending judgment.
Now local legal lights are asking *Â»ach
other how can habeas corpus proceedings
be instituted on behalf of a free man.
Judge Turner will be out $20 to the Board
of Supervisors, and Attorney Wheeler will
laugh in his sleeve.

likewise had the habit of forgetfulness.

dler in the hospital corps during the Re
bellion. Consequently he is an expert
with firearms and needs no practice.
The first day's proceedings in the case
were conducted with a decorum which
was ominous. Each side ignored the other
in the most studied manner, and there
was such a complete lack of verbal tilt
ing between the attorneys that the trial
became monotonous.
Most of the witnesses were lawyers who
had been interested in some way in the
original litigation between Simpson and
the late Joseph Macdonough. They were
unanimous in their ability to forget things
and none of them gave any testimony
which had a material bearing on the pres
ent suit. Simpson took the stand late in
the afternoon, but court adjourned before
he had an opportunity to tell much of
his story.
"I went to 'Nusy' when I was"
" 'Nusy?' Who's 'Nusy?' " asked Judge
Coffey. â¢
"Why, Judge Nusbaumer," replied
Simpson.
Then everybody, including the defend
ant, laughed. This aroused Simpson's ire
and he gave the balance of his statement
in an angry voice.
"Those lawyers were breaking me. they
charged so much," he declared, "and I
went to Judge Nusbaumer and told him I
wanted my suit against Macdonough set
tled. I. told him to do the best he could
for me and to make the attorneys scale
down their charges. I was especially em
phatic about that, because I wanted the
lawyers to leave a little money for myself
and my creditors. He agreed to do the
work for $150. When the suit was com
promised I went with Judge Nusbaumer
to the office of Attorney Cole in San Fran
cisco. He went in first and then stuck his
head out of the door and told me to keep
out, as Macdonough was there and there
would surely be a row If I entered. I
hung around for two hours, and was
finally frozen out, so I went home. The
next day Judge Nusbaumer told me he
had settled for $19,000."
"Judge Nusbaumer scaled down the
charges of the lawyers," said Attorney
M. C. Chapman as he took the stand, "and
I received tho Insignificant sum of $150 for
five solid weeks of work which I did for
Simpson."
Lawyer Chapman knew practically
nothing about the differences between
Judge Nusbaumer and Simpson. He was
followed by Attorney Moore.
"Judge Nusbaumer Is a life-long friend
of mine," he said, "and Simpson has been
my bitter enemy ever since I refused to
longer have him for a client one day in
1593. For that reason I shall be most care
ful in what I say."
Lawyer Moore exhibited a great inabil
ity to remember things and could throw
no light on the controversy. He was fol
lowed by several other attorneys, who

MISS SHARON.
Mr. Allen dates back several years,
for at one time he lived in Oakland,
afterward moving to San Jose and
then to Seattle. Upon returning a few
months ago he heard Miss Sharon's
voice ai\d wrote to suit it a pastoral,
in which Miss Pauline Fore also sang
a part. The pastoral was presented
before a very fashionable audience
for the benefit of a charity, and won
praise for composer and singers. It
was whispered then that Miss Sharon
and Mr. Allen were engaged, but since
the bride's mother would not affirm
the rumor it grew to nothing more.
Miss Sharon is a graduate of the
Oakland High School and a student
at the University of California. After
the wedding in May Mr. Allen will
take his bride abroad and will there
resume his musical studies and work.
Society will miss Miss Sharon greatly,
for she is beloved for not only her
beauty, which is of the spirituelle
type, but for her graciousness and
thoughtfulness for others.
At to-night's dinner, which was the
announcement dinner as well as tha
feast in honor of a returned friend,
the guests were; Dr. and Mrs. Ray
mond Palmer (Mme. Nevada), Miss
Mlgnon Palmer, Mrs. H. C. Mygatt,
Miss Cora Young, Miss Elsa yon
Mandersheld, Miss Pauline Fore. Miss
Florence Sharon, Miss Blanche Sha
ron, Peter C. Allen, Robert C, Newell,
Walter Leimert, William Mem and
Claude Sharon.
Following the dinner there was a
small" and informal reception. The in
vitations had been sent out only to
musical people and to neighbors.
Mme. Nevada not feeling equal to a
large function. The singer, her hus
band and daughter will remain at the
Sharon home to-night and will return
to San Francisco to-morrow.
SEVERAL BRITISH
GENERALS BREAK DOWN
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â A World special
from London says: Lord Methuen is not
the only victim of the strain of this war.
It is now admitted everywhere that Gen
eral Symons rushed to his death in a
frenzy of despair on seeing the British
regiment beaten at Glencoe.
General Yule has been living in the
strictest seclusion since his arrival in
London. He is prematurely aged and
feeble.
General Barton, who led a brigade at
Colenso, is said to have been invalided
home. He had the same sad experience
from that terrible fight.
Even General Buller*s health, it is de
clared, is suffering gravely, and if his new
movement fails it is deemed certain that
he will return. Generals Kitchener, Hec
tor McDonald, Tucker and French are
now the sole remaining hope of the Brit
ish army.

here to-day, but the difficulty between
France and Santo Domingo has been sat
isfactorily arranged through the French
admiral and the officials of the Govern
ment. The latter will probably issue a
proclamation thanking the public for its
patriotic feelings and declaring at the
same time there was no intention to
offend France in the patriotic demonstra
tions or to molest its representative. The
French warship Suchet left yesterday.

ENGAGEMENT Of FLORENCE SHARON
TO PETER C. ALLEN ANNOUNCED
FIGHT BETWEEN
SIMPSON AND
NUSBAUMER ON
Judge Coffey Hearing
the Case.
OAKLAND, Jan. 13.â Judge Nusbaumer
and his friends marched into the Supe
rior Court to-day, each armed with a
large, rapid fire revolver and a determi
nation to fight until the last man
dropped should hostilities occur. Attor
ney McElrath. R. S. Simpson and their
followers also proceeded to the Temple
of Justice in columns of, fours, with
death-dealing devices secreted in their
right hip pockets. They looked fierce and
warlike and stood in martial array while
Judge Coffey of San Francisco opened
court and commenced the hearing of the
famous suit for an accounting com
menced some time ago by Simpson
against Nusbaumer. Almost every law
yer in Oakland was present, eagerly look
ing for a clash. The only man who look
ed scared was his Honor from across the
bay, and he intrenched himself behind
an array of briefs and law documents
that were hard enough to stop a cannon
ball.
Judge Nusbaumer purchased the larg
est pistol the hardware market affords
and has been treking out to the veldt
back of the city every day during the
past month, where he has been indus
triously practicing on a target that was
rigged up to look like his enemy. Simp
son had also been making trips out to
the firing line and can now occasionally
hit the bullseye when the target is not
too far away. Major McKlrath was a sol-
BRANDS CHARGES
AGAINST WOMEN
AS UNWARRANTED
Mrs. Pelton Replies to
Maloon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 13.
Mrs. Margaret B. Pelton, the official
press agent of the W. C. T. U.. has is
sued a statement in mply to the recent
charges made by License Inspector
Henry Maloon that Oakland women se
cured liquor in drugstores. She defends
the Oakland women, and says:
"The Oakland W. C. T. U. has
taken no action upon drugstores as
yet, while deeply anxious to strike
a blow at the traffic whenever an op
portunity offers. We are quietly
canvassing the groceries of Oakland
to ascertain how many of them fur
nish liquor to their patrons. This
work is done by a large committee,
whose work has been hindered by the
recent storms, but which will soon
be completed.
"I believe that License Inspector
Maloon is mistaken about our society
women drinking or visiting drug
stores to procure liquor. There may
be Isolated cases of this kind, but the
large representation of Oakland so
ciety women In all clubs and associa
tions of educational, civic and phll
anthropical alms forbids the thought
that many of the class have so far
forgotten the noblesse oblige as to
degrade their own high standing.
"Fabiola Hospital is a grand monu
ment to which every Oaklander points
with pride as the work of these la
dies, and there are half a score lesser
institutions that are blessing the citi
zens of Oakland built up and con
stantly cared for and supported by
these noble women.
"Let us give honor where honor is
due. and do not be so ready to throw
stones at these birds of finer plumage
who have added so much to the
beauty of our fair city and have
given it, bo far as they could, the
right to be called the 'City of
Homes.'
"The kind of talk indulged in by
Mr. Maloon Is too prevalent, and
while it may not cause a ripple of
comment among the accused it does
and will have its influence upon
those who are Just forming their
opinions and habits. Anything which
tends to lower respect and veneration
for women, high or low, has a down
ward tendency for the youth of the
community.v,
"When we begin to tear down or de
face the ornamental facades and tt c
minarets, domes and spires of our so
cial fabric it will not be long before
the effect is felt to the deepest foun
dation.
"What a beautiful world this would
be if men drank as little, swore as lit
tle and were as devoted to good
works as their sister women. Cradled
together in the same loving mother's
arms, guided together by the same
gentle counsel, why should it be need
ful for the paths in life to diverge so
radically that what is right for the
brother becomes a public scandal
when applied to the Flster?
"MARGARET B. PELTON."
FRUIT-GROWERS WILL
BE WELL REPRESENTED
Prune District Has Been Thoroughly
Canvassed â Sentiment is Unan
imous for Organization.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 13.â The entire prune
area of the State will be represented at
the convention of dried fruit men which
convenes here in the Unitarian Church
Monday morning, and it will be the most
important meeting of deciduous fruit
growers ever held on the Pacific Coast.
There will be about 400 delegates present,
representing fifteen counties of the State.
Every prune section has been thoroughly
canvassed, and it is asserted that the
organization to be formed will control
fully 55 per cent of the prune output of
the State. The growers are unanimous
in favor of organization and are taking an
unusual interest.
The convention will be called together
by S. P. Saunders, the chairman of the
committee appointed to make arrange
ments for the meeting. This committee
will also report in favor of organization
under the co-operative act of 1&95, form
ing an association similar to that of the
raisin growers. It is expected that at
least two days will be occupied in ef
fecting organization. Such prominent
horticulturalists as Messrs. Naftzger of
the Orange Growers' Association, Kear
ney of the Raisin Growers, Sprague of
the Southern California Deciduous Grow
ers, R. L.. Stephens, Secretary Lelong of
the Horticultural Commission and others
will be in attendance.
As soon as organization is effected in
corporation will be had under the State
law and the preliminary work for the
handling of the coming crop begun.
A meeting of green fruit men will be
held in Hale's Hall at the same time and
an organization also formed.
When these two bodies have been
firmly established they will undoubtedly
unite and handle their products through
one central head in the East.
CLAIMS GROWING OUT
OF THE PHILIPPINE WAR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 13,-It is probable
that claims amounting in the aggregate
to many millions of dollars will be made
against the United States by persons who
have lost property through military op
erations in the Philippine Islands. One
suit for J2SQ.WO has uiready been begun
through tne New York Export and Import
Company of this city.
This claim grows out of the bombard
ment of lloilo by Admiral Dewey's ships.
It is made on behalf of Hallman & Co., a
firm of Swiss merchants who had an es
tablishment in that city. When the Amer
ican troops landed in lloilo General Otis
proclaimed American sovereignty and
Hallman &. Co., with other foreign mer
chants took out licenses enabling them to
continue operations. Soon afterward the
insurgents threatened the city in the rear
and General Otis asked the Navy Depart
ment to send vessels to bombard their
trenches. In anticipation of the bombard
ment he issued an order notifying foreign
residents that the city would be shelled
and giving them sixty hours in which to
withdraw their merchandise.
Admiral Dewey's ships were two days
ahead of time, and began shelling the
rebel trenches as soon as they arrived.
The city was set on fire and the ware
houses of Hallman & Co. were destroyed.
They immediately made a protest to
General Otis on the ground that the
American Government, being in charge of
the city, was responsible for the loss, es
pecially as it was inflicted by American
guns and not by Filipinos. Their prop
erty was insured for $110,000, but this can
not be collected, as companies are ' not
liable for losses resulting from an act of
war. The suit will be decided by Congress
and the Court of Claims.
Hallman & Co. were correspondents of
the New York Export and Import Com
pany, which has other correspondents
similarly situated. The treasurer of the
company said to-night that so far as he
knew no other claims had yet been filed,
but that others probably would be made
in the near future.
Dr. Snider Dead.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 13.â Dr. T. A. Sni
der, a prominent physician of this city,
died to-nignt of appendicitis. He was op
erated on yesterday, but the disease had
been allowed to progress too far. He was
a native of Virginia and 74 years of age.
SON-IN-LAW IS
CLEANED OUT BY
MOTHER-IN-LAW
She Took Furniture,
Wife and Babe.
OAKLAND. Jan. 13.â Harry Sparber Is
minus his girl-wife, his infant babe and a
t-et of furniture valued at $500. He claims
i hat the whole outfit was captured and is
betas illegally detained by his mother-in
law. Mrs. Sarah Hysourah Walters, for
which he demands $10,000 damages. Spar
ber also declares he will beg-In habeas cor
pus proceedings to secure possession of
the human portion of his household and
replevin proceedings to get back the bal
ance cf his property.
Mrs. Waiters Is a woman of considera
ble wealth and resides at 711 Broadway.
Her 17-year-old daughter and Sparber
â¢were married on June 2S. IS3S. and moved
to Angels Camp, where they set up in
housekeeping and were getting along in
the most turtle dove fashion until Mrs.
Walters made her appearance. Then
trouble commenced and it has been pre
vailing ever elnce.
The young husband protested against
the efforts of hi? mother-in-law to run
his household so she left and incidentally
took ail of the furniture belonging to
Sparber with her. He then took his wife
end baby to San Francisco to reside and
had been there but a short time when his
mother-in-law once more became an aw
ful presence In his domicile.
Onre more she declared herself dictator
of the little household and Sparber again
objected to her rule of bosslsm. Upon his
return from work one day recently he
found his home deserted.
"My mother-in-law enticed my wife
away from me and I am confident that
the is being detained against her Â¦will."
declared Sparbcr. "When we were mar
ried my mother-in-law promised to set
me up in business. Instead of doing: so
ehe rave me an old second-hand eet of
furniture. Then she took that away and
now she has got my wife and baby. Rose
and I always jrot along finely until her
mother commenced to interfere with us."

TIMEMAKER
FIGURED IN
A CLOSE FIT
Schorr's Sprinter Downed
Flower of Gold a Nose*
Erwin Beaten by
Anjou.
Fog and a chilling blast wafted In from
the ocean kept many from attending the
sport at Tanforart Park. The fair sex
was well represented in the stand, but the
crowd In the betting ring was light for a
Saturday gathering. Aside from two
events the racing was uninteresting, re
sulting in three favorites earning purses.
Timemaker, the sturdy crack of the
Schorr stable, showed a streak of his real
form when he defeated Flower of Gold
and Sardine In the fifth, a six furlong run.
Throughout the betting Sardine had a
commanding call, the prevailing price laid
being c to 5, while 7 to 2 could be had
about the Schorr entry. Flower of Gold
seemed to be a drug on the market at a
to 2, and she nearly turned the trick. Out
footing Sardine from the very start, the
Rancho del Paso fllly led to within ten
feet of the wire, where Jenkins with one
stroke of his whip landed Timemaker first
by a aose. It was the prettiest piece of
saddle work Jenkins has shown since his
arrival here. The favorite finished a
good third. The winner's time, 1:13,
equaled the track record.
Barney Schrciber's fast filly Sofala
scored her second victory in the two-year
old scramble. Coupled with KingstellÂ©
the pair closed 9 to 10 choices, with Laura
Marie next in demand. Sofala led from
the Jump, winning easily from Lilly
Diggs. Laura Mane ran third.
The Schreiber colors were again suc
cessful In the mile and a furlong selling
affair which followed, being carried to the
front by Stuttgart. The Belgowan geld
ing started a 4 to 5 favorite, and after
making all the pace disposed of Del Paso
II very cleverly. Whaleback came from
behind, taking the show.
A cheap band of "crabs" lined up In the
third event, a five furlong sprint, with
Monda a 3 to 2 favorite in the ring. Al
bert Baldwin Sr. gave the choice a rub to
the stretch, where he began stopping.
Piggott then came fast with Romany, a
9 to 1 shot, forcing Jenkins to ride Monda
out to win by less than a length. Wild
Het ran into the show.
Eight lined up in the mile run for three
year-olds that started in the San Bruno
Btake and ran unplaced. Tar Hill carried
the coin of the smart ones at odds of 9 to
B, failing utterly to show that he pos
sessed any great amount of class. Erwln
took the lead after a quarter had been
covered and looked to have the race won
at the paddock, when Spencer on Ajijou
collared and led him out a nose. Tar Hill
finished third.
The books laid 3 to 1 that Lomo could
not repeat his win of earlier in the week
over the timber in the concluding num
ber. He did, however, and very easily,
after showing first all the way. Balista,
a 12 to 1 shot, reached the wire half a
length before the favorite, Meddler, for
second place.

Lavert 3 4CHICAGO, Jan. It.â The wheat market, like
the fat boy of Pickwickian fame, took naps
on every possible occasion to-day. The feeling
was generally bearish, but trade was so small
that nothing of any account resulted from the
sentiment. Scalpers, when anything was done,
were the ones who did it. May opened a ehade
up at 67%@67%c because Liverpool showed Ho
advance. Following this May eased off to
67%Â®67*>4c. Light primary receipts and fair
clearances together with some miscellaneous
reports of damages by Insects furnished suf
ficient support to carry the market up a bit.
May touching 67%Â®67%c. Those who could
took small profits at this point and the market
eased off again. The close was barely steady.
May Vie over yesterday at 67*io.
As offerings from first hands were no larger
and the weather not favorable for the move
ment the corn market remained firm but quiet
and handled mostly by scalpers. May closed
a shade over yesterday at 53%@53%0.
Oats were steady and featureless. May closed
unchanged at 24c.
The provision market ruled firm at a trifle
under yesterday's prices. Trade was moder
ately brisk at times but generally dull. May
pork closed 2V&QSc under yesterday, at $110
11 02H- May lard unchanged at 16 07H, and
May ribs 2ViC lower at 15 S2ft.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 13.â The strictly profes
sional limit of trading on tha Stock Exchange
irt; well Illustrated by the almost complete
obliteration of the morning's advices In the
movement to take profits after the appearance
of the back statement. This exhibit was In
Itself a favorable one, aa were all the other
Incidents of the day and It conformed closely
to the preliminary estimates on which . the
buying had been based. The activity In
Sugar certiSca.tes continued, the price ris
ing an extreme three points against the
charts, whose covering demand helped on
the advance. The bears Quickly detected the
realizing after the back statement and forced
Eugar down 4% points. Brooklyn Transit and
Tobacco showed clom sympathy and some
otber specialties lost a point or over. A de
cline of 1% in New York Central showed come
special pressure against that stock. Otherwise
gains had been fractional and the reaction did
not exceed thea. There was some selling for
London account aa prices rose above the Lon
don parity. A fractional rally la London dis
count rates and a Jump of 3 pfennigs In the
cterling exchaafe rate at Berlin were without
ext>larifctloa. The bank statement fully ac
counts for the Increased disposition of New
York backers to place time loans at present
rates and their reappearance as buyers of
commercial jjaper. The decline In money rates
iÂ» also bringlr^g renewed demand for railroad
bonds from some of the great insurance com
panies, borne heavy individual transactions in
bonds are recorded. The central tact in the
situation In the etock market is that the buy-
Izig deroand is listless and narrow and without
stimulation by Â«uny favorable developments in
the Immediate outlook. Even the investment
tuying has almost ceased, either because prices
are above an attractive level or because the
available funds from dividend or Interest dis
bursements have found investment. Invest
ment buying does not In itself serve to ad
vance prices greatly, but It has a large sentl
xaeixiaJ effect as It insures the constant diminu
tion on the floating eupply of stocks held
merely for an advance in price. The market
fcas suffered from the demoralization In special
stocks In addition to the withdrawal of the
Influence or Investment buying. There has
t**n besides selling for London account, which
Â«as only <Uecontlcued wben the reduction In
the discount rates of the banks of England,
J-'rance and Germany gave confidence in tne
reality of the relaxation in money rates. The
volume of foreign selling was not large aad
would have been easily absorbed In an ordinary
movement for on advance, but as the fore:gn
celling grew out of the needs of the London
mo&ey market and served to increase the pres
sure for gold In New York there was no dis
position to bold up prices to afford a market
Xcr London tellers to make profits. Notwith
standing the Â«na!l demand for stocks the eup
p:>- was scarce and railroad stocks have re
iponded quickly all week to any sort of buy
ing derr.a&d. The market gives evidence of
liquidation of speculative holdings of stocks.
fetaten-.ents of the New York clearing-house
barms a* well aÂ» thoee of the great foreign
bbtiks show that speculators the world over
have been telling their holdings, paying off
loans and withdrawing from the Held. Many
commission houses and brokerage offlces In
Vail street which found busy occupation all
of last year have 'â¢eased to Invite custom
penCing thÂ«- development of aew factors in the
outlook. This closing out of accounts, now
safely attained, has involved some heavy losses
and no Email bitterness of fplrlt, which Is re-,
fleeted in the ditcuiwslon by brokers of Indus
trial commissions and their flotations in a
spirit far from complimentary.
This feeling was deepened by the strong of
ficial intimation at the stockholders* annual
meeting of the American Sugar Kenning Com
pany that the business was not profitable in
the present sense cf new competition and that
fiivaends would probably be reduced or sus
pended during the coming year, Professional
operators thereupon fell tooth and nail upon
tee .-jir.tr certificates, as well as other Indus
trial stocks,, and sold them by the thousand
fchfcres.
The railroad list did not escape entirely, but
was much lets affected. The low price of the
dividend-paying Industrials, bringing the rate
of return in coroe cases up to t per cent or over,
reflects the rating of the risk in holding tbe*e
nyn v .s. The beginning of dividends on the
common slock* has failed to elicit any
advance in price, and the preferred stocks
cf the came companies have shown a tend
ency In such cases to decline, as having
the safety cf their dividends impaired. There
U an element In Wall ttreet who preach the
coctrine that the country has reached the erect
cf prosperity.
They cite m evidence of this the marked dimi
nution of the grain and cotton movements,
compared with laat year, and point to the com
paratively email increases In gross earnings
cf railroads. While these show last year's
earnings well maintained, last year's prosper
ity hum already been reflected In prices, and
/.U ; <r prices depend on increased prosperity
rather then en the maintenance of. the present
level. High prices of commodities are likely to
curtail the demand. Advances in railroad rates
now being enforced lead to falling off In the
volume .cf t raffle. Increased cost of material
makee encroachment on net earnings by en
hancing the cost of operation. Such are some
Â«X the reasons assigned by capitalists and op-

NETW YORK, Jan. 18.â The Financier a*yÂ»:
"The New York bank statement for the week
ending January IS was even better tftwn had
beÂ«n expected. The surplus reserve Increased
almost $6,000,000 and the excess above legal re
quirements now stands at $11,707,350, a sum
greater than the banks have reached since
June 24 last, although In August the total was
almost as high. As the deposits during the
week remained almost stationary the entire
cash receipts of the week went to swell the
Idle cash in banks, thus accounting for ' the
unusual expansion. The liquidation that oc
curred on the stock exchange is reflected In the
decrease of $1,658,900 In loans. The statement
does not balance, but there Is no question
that the position of the banks Is even stronger
than reported, for interior receipts increased
largely at the close of the week. The gain
came almost entirely from the Interior, the ex
ports of specie to Europe tha previous Satur
day counterbalancing treasury receipts. The
banks in fact are gaining as rapidly In sur
plus this month as was the case a year ago,
with the exception that the expansion In each
now counts altogether In surplus reserve,
whereas a year ago reserve liability occasioned
by the loan and deposit increases were locking
up from three to live million dollars weekly.
For instance, the deposits of the banks during
the month of January, rose almost $57,000,000,
while loans expanded twenty-three millions.
The reserve requirements were, therefore, over
fourteen millions heavier, but decplte this fact
the surplus reserve actually gained eighteen
millions. This year so far loans have risen
les9 than two millions; deposits only a little
over nine millions, while the excess reserve la
tor* than six millions heavier. The expansion,
therefore, this year does not compare with that
of a year ago, although the gain in reserve
Is on a plane that nearly equals that which
occurred last year. It is not to be overlooked
in this connection that the banks last Decem
ber and January were not losing gold to
Europe, as has been the case lately."
London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 13.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial- cablegram says:
Buelnees In the markets here to-day was very
small, but the tone was excellent, based on
hopes of good news from the Transvaal, which
the professional began to anticipate In markets
bare of stocks. Consols were up % and led the
rise. Cheap money helped the oheerful feeling.
American securities shared In the improve
ment, but the trading was of minute propor
tions. No gold was received or engaged.
Money rates continued easy at yesterday's
rates and bills were scarce. Large money bal
ances are unemployed, but the gold position Is
still watched with some oonoern. Holland Is
expected to buy specie and the supply Is mea
ger. It Is feared that India, which Is inter
cepting Australian arrivals, will take bullion.
A shipment will be made next week.
Silver was strong. Speculation In It Is
awakening In India and the market demand Is
keenly felt. The market Is nervous, watching
French tenders to-day, which may continue for
some time, though not so long as last year.
