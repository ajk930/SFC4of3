flank. The plan is that Lyttel
ton's brigade should engage the
enemy in front, while Warren's
division tries to attack the right
flank. If Buller should succeed
in beating the Boers and joining
hands with White, the Boer
army, which must retreat across
Klip River, between Ladysmith
and Colenso, will be in a perilous
position, for Sir Redvers will be
as near Glencoe on the railway
to Newcastle as the Boers them
selves. Having chosen the most
effective direction and one which
offers the best prospects of suc
cess, General Buller has decided
to strike with all his might."
REPORTS COME FROM
BULLER AND ROBERTS
LONDON, Jan. 15.â 9:37 p. m.â The War

GOING TO CAPETOWN.
LONDON. Jan. 19.â Rudyard Kipling:
and his family will sail for Capo Town
to-morrow (Saturday).
LONDON, Jan., 19.â There
.is a persistent rumor afloat
this morning that Lady
smith has been relieved. The
same story had reached the War
Office by midnight, coupled with
the statement that a "decisive vic
tory had been won by the British.
Officials there, while professing
to have received no further dis
patches than those given out, in
timated that perhaps the second
rumor, as indicating a battle had
been fought, might be true, but
they placed no confidence in the
first story. .
The latest news received is
contained in General Buller's dis
patch which states that General
Warren's entire force had cross
ed the Tugela at Trichardts Drift
and expected to advance five
miles from the river by last even
ing. As the Boers were in
trenched on his right front, this
clearly indicates the possibility of
an encounter at any minute, but
the relief of the besieged city is
not at hand. As to future moves
it is all guesswork. The Boers
have strong positions on Arnot
Hill Farm", some six miles from
Potgieters Drift. This position
is open to a turning movement
by the west, which would cut it
off from the Free State passes,
and by the east also, if the garri
son of Ladysmith could make a
strong movement against the en
emy's position by Onderbrook
and Groblers Kloof.
General Buller has two drifts
in his hands, , which gives him
great maneuvering power. He
is holding Colenso in front by a
brigade, having the right pro
tected and his railway line to
Frere guarded by divisional
troops. After enough men have
been left in the trenches and
drifts he would have for maneu
vering purposes besides his cay-
airy and mounted infantry about
twenty battalions of infantry.
There would be two brigades
comprising eight battalions with
batteries and. naval guns to make
a good advance and fight the
Boers, if needful, on their south
ern front. There would be some
twelve battalions, two cavalry
regiments of irregular horse and
five field batteries under General
Warren to work a way to the
west, maybe to Dewdrop or Ac
ton Homes, or perhaps farther
to the west by.Rustenberg Farm.
It is not thought ' he will at
tempt to force .Â» the western
passes. They, are fortified, and
the Boers have j five, if not six,
lines of communication \ by i three
'principal Free State passes, by
railway through !Charlestown, by
Landman's Drift and from ;, Vry
heid. * Warren --will-- probably
work so that he will not give the
Boers any, idea as to whether he
is making for the Free State
passes or for Ladysmith. If he
maneuvers westward, he will cer
tainly draw off some of the Boers
from their new position, which
might help General Hildyard's
forces or another near him to
take the north of Colenso posi
tion or Groblers Kloof position
in the rear and then press on and
join. hands with â¢ General White

The Morning Post's war critic

The Cape Town correspondent of the
Times, discussing Afrikander disloyalty,
says :
"I believe the sympathy of every Dutch
man In South Africa is with the two re
publics, and that a general rising is still
quite possible. However, there is nothing
to Implicate the bund party as a whole in
an officially organized conspiracy against
the imperial Government, although the
bund leaders have winked at or pandered
lo sedition in order to preserve their pop
ularity. The British failures and the ap
pearance of the Boers on British territory
have fomented rebellion, but even now a
decisive British victory would prevent its
further spread."

MANY MEN WANT
TO JOIN THE BOERS
NEW YORK. Jan. 18.â George W. Van
Slclen, treasurer of the American Trans

and twenty able-bodied young men ap
plied to him in person every day to be sent
to South Africa to fight on the Boer side.
"Since the war started." said Mr. Van
Slclen. "there have been 1000 applications,
by actual count, of men who want to go
to the Transvaal and fight England. I
have not got the money to send them and
would not send them if I could. What
would be the use of my losing both men
and money? The British cruisers would
be sure to take the men off the ships be
fore they could reach a South African port

xne only lawful i .ing we can do in this
country is. to send money to the widows

who call at my office and want to be sent
out as recruits are an exceptionally fine
lot of men. They are neither beggars nor

of them give up good positions and come

PATROL OF LANCERS
AMBUSHED BY BOERS
RENSBERG. Cape Colony. Wednesday.
Jan. 17.â A patrol composed of sixteen
men of the New South Wales Lancers
and South Australians was ambushed yes
terday by the Boers and overwhelmed,
after a severe fight. Eight of the detach
ment escaped and have arrived in camp.
The remainder were killed or captured!
This morning a patrol visited the scene
of the fight and found one dead Aus
tralian and one wounded man. A number
of dead Boer horses were also found,
showing that the Australians made a gal
lant fight before surrendering.
It appears that when the Australians
encountered the first body of Boers and
found their retreat cut off they galloped
for a nearby kop.ie. hoping to beat off thÂ«
Boers, but on arriving they found another
force of burghers concealed.
GREAT BATTLE MAY
BE COMMENCED TO-DAY

sider that the expected battle along the
wide arc south and west of Ladysnv*. 1
can hardly be delayed beyond to-Uay.
From Durban It is reported that figh'ing
has already begun. General Buller's
forces engaged in the flanking operation
across the Tugela are some 13,000 or 14 OX)

that the whole army will be in action
when the hour for combined movement
arrives. Three weeks ago General Bulier
had 3OJOOO men. Considerable reinforce

probably 23.000 men and eighty guns all

Estimates of how many men and guns
the Boers have to oppose him are mere
puess work. In not replying to General

"NO TURNING BACK"
SAYS GENERAL BULLER
MOUNT ALICE (near Potgieters Drift).
Natal, Monday, Jan. 13.â The forward
movement for the relief of Ladysmith be
gan on Wednesday, January 10, from
Frere and Chleveley. Lord Dundonald's
mounted brigade, with the Fifth brigade,
under General Hart, comprising the Dub-
Hns, the Connaughts, the Inniskillena
and the Border regiment, proceeded
northwesterly to SprlngfleM. The position
had previously been thoroughly reeon
noitered. A few miles outside of Frere
Lord Dundonald passed targets erected
by the Boers to represent a force advanc
ing In skirmishing order. Evidently the
Boers had been firing at these from adja
cent hills. Lord Dundonald pushed on,
and as the main column advanced It was
noticed that Springfield was not occupied
by Boers and that the Fifth Brigade had
taken position. The British transport
train extended for several miles and com
prised some 5000 vehicles.
The mounted brigade advanced rapidly,
not meeting with any opposition. Tha
British scouts had minutely searched all
the suspicious country, but there was no
sign of the enemy. The column advanced
to Mount Alice, facing the enemy's moun
tain fortress.
The Boers had been at Potgieters Drift
the previous day, but a body of South
African horsemen swam the stream un
der fire and brought over the pont from
the Boer side.
The Boers were evidently surprised at
the appearance of the British. A camp
could be seen on the Tugela heights, fac
ing Mount Alice, but the enemy quickly
struck camp and cleared off into the
mountains. A buggy was seen leaving for
the hills on the right, presumably with
General Joubert or some other com
mander.
General Buller took up his quarters in
a pleasantly situated farmhouse belonging
to Martlnus Pretorlus, who has disap
peared.
On Friday a loud explosion was heard.
Subsequently it was found that the Boers
had destroyed a bridge under construction
seven miles above Potgletera Drift. Gen
eral Buller has issued a spirited appeal
and Instructions to the forces, beginning:
"We are going to the relief of our com
rades in Ladysmith. There will be no
turning back."
The order proceeds to a<lvise the men,
when they charge, regarding the condi
tions under which they should receive
the surrender of any of the enemy. It
also warns them that the Boers ard

This order has been received with en
thusiasm.
The march was very trying, but tha
troops are now encamped amid very
pleasant surroundings. Their health la

BOERS OCCUPY PRIESKA.
CRADDOCK. Cape Colony. Jan. IS.â
On Saturday, January 13, the Boers, with
a commando of colonial rebels, occupied
Prieska. a village on the Orange River,
about ten miles northwest of De Aar.
on the Bourse, as he is not a member.
If the allegations were true he would be
simply a private speculator, acting
through a broker and unable for the mo
ment to meet his obligations.
The Marquis de Castellane has written
to the Matin the following:
"Your good faith has been abused. My
son. Count Boni. never indulged in any
Bourse speculations and consequently
cannot have been proceeded against. If
he were in Paris he himself would dis
pose of this invention. In his absence his
father begs you to repair the involuntary
wrong you have done him."
Inquiries made at the best sources of In
formation, which, however, are not will
ing to be quoted, are that Count de Cas
tellane was involved in speculation in an
ticipation of a rise In stocks on account of
the expected British victory In the Trans
vaal, and the British reverses caused such
a depreciation that It was impossoble for
him to meet his losses with ready money.
The speculations are understood to have
been through private sources, and. there
fore, it is diffcult to secure absolute con
firmation of the reports. The matter prob
ably will be settled privately.
The Matin's assertions were the leading
topic of conversation at the clubs and
other social meeting places throughout
the day. The evening papers reproduced
the story, although without in any way
guaranteeing its accuracy. The Count's
father gave a fresh turn to the affair by
writing a letter to the editor of Figaro,
Fcrnand de Rodays, intimating that he
must be prepared to fight a duel with the
Count on the latter's return, or even with
the Maro.uis himself. In the course of the
communication, after denouncing the
statement of the Figaro as canaillerlo,
th<? Marquis says:
"If my son were not on the sea for New
York he would undertake to demonstrate
for you the emptiness of this tittle-tattle,
and would require from you reparation on
grounds he would choose. In his absence
I take his place. Your scandalous Insinu
ation Is a mere political trick, which
others would describe as Dreyfusard."
The Solr, which was previously- owned
l>y the Castellanes and which Is a- strong
Nationalist organ, bitterly opposed to the
Figaro, which championed Dreyfus, after
speaking in fulsome terms of the Count's
character as a gentleman and a patriot,
says:
"It Is not difficult to see the origin and
motives of M. de Roday's maneuver. Tt Is
desired to inure him who drove Joseph
Reinach from his seat In Parliament. This
Is a vile political vengeance, which all
good men will denounce."
PARTS. Jan. IS âThe allied heavy '
losses of Count Eoni de Castellane
on the Bourse were made a sensa
tional feature by some of the pa
pers here to-day. Both the Temps
and Figaro spoke, in a guarded
way of the collapse of a bull speculator
whose position is said to have been oanlv
ehaken at the last settlement by the de
clir.e cf certain stocks in which lie is said
to have plunged. The Figaro also in li-
Cated Count Boni de Castellane fairly ar.d
clearly by describing the speculator as a
member of the Chamber of Deputies and
a prominent society man, who had not
disguised his sympathies for uncompro
mising nationalism. Moreover, it Â«n.Â«
added he hud started on a long voyage
"to find resources to repair his broKen
fortunes."
The Figaro added, perhaps a little ma
liciously, that h!s friends hope he will not
meet with disappointment, saying? "Some
â¢patriotic' causes are very expensive, and
for want of a better excuse this pretext
can always be put forward to this?,
owing to distance, who are Ignorant of
many things."
The Matin openly mentioned Count de
Castellane's name and nothing but dis
astrous speculations. The losses, reach
ing as high as 20.000,000 francs, were
talked of yesterday. Respecting the
Count, the Matin says:
'"But our own inquiries Rhow his loss-?*
<3o not exceed 3.000.000. he having suc
ceeded In getting straight on seven or
eight transactions. Count Boni de Castel
lane left for New York a few days ago
with his wife, ami it Is probable thf as
sistance of his brother-in-law will not be
found wanting, and that he will tide over
the situation of monetary embarrass
ment."
The Matin also took the opportunity to
make the following interesting remarks
concerning Count <1c Castellane's position
here. It informed its readers that hiÂ«
wife's "dot" was HSjOOOyOOO, which gave an
income of. over 5500.000. and that even at
Paris he, could cut a figure with that, add
ing:
"All Parisians know the grandiose man
sion on the Avenue dv Bois de Boulogne,
which is the hobby of his wife, who
dreamed to outvie the Vanderc:lts' palace
on Fifth avenue by a perfect reproduc
tion of the celebrated castle cf Blois.
Count Boni's well-known generosity prob
ably explains his contribution of 15,000
francs to M. Deroulede, which figured in
the police chiefs report en the ar.tl-re

Senator "Wellington Makes a
Speech in Which He Forcibly
Argues Against the Policy of
Imperialism.
Words of Sympathy for the Boers, Who
Are Struggling to Maintain Their Inde
pendence â Favors Self-Gove-rnment for
the Filipinos.
WASHINGTON. Jan. IS.â For an
hour to-day Wellington of
Maryland (R) occupied the at
tention of the Senate, continu
ing the debate on the Philip
pine question. He took as his
text the resolution he Introduced last
Tuesday, declaring that the United
States should not take permanent
possession of the archipelago; but, after
subduing the Insurrectionâ which he sin
cerely deploredâ should confer upon the
Filipinos the right to govern themselves,
affording them such protection as they
might need.
Wellington said he was not ready to
enter upon a policy of expansion, "the
first exemplification of which Is to be the
' taking by force of arms of the islands,
persons and privileges of the Philippine
Islanders." History Indicated that "im
perial destiny" had wrecked many repub
lics. He believed that one of the greatest
blessings that ever befell England was
the loss of the American Colony. Refer
ring to Great Britain's war with the
Transvaal, Wellington said:
She has not met the Caucasian race since the
Crimean war and now, when for the first time
for half a century she attempts to send her
army to destroy a brave and courageous but
unfortunate people, she all at once rudely
awakens from the dream of her power, because
she finds that corruption has eaten to her very
vitals, and her army, which she deemed was
still like that of Cromwellâ lnvincibleâ has
'been belabored and defeated every day since
it attacked the Boers. And Justly so. And
It may be. at no distant time, that the ln
sidicus influences which have thus debased her
will entirely destroy the weighty structure of
the empire she has erected.
If the propositions advanced in 1776 were true
then and applicable to the American people
struggling for freedom, have they grown less
forceful by the passage of n century and a
quarter of time* And are they less applicable
now to a strapping people In the year WOO,
even though they dwell In the distance and are
weak beginners In the contention fcr national
life and the establishment of government by
their own consent, so long denied them by the
tyranny of Spain. If It were true then. It la
true now.
In the language of President McKlnley him
self, "From Plymouth Rock to the Philippines,
the grand triumph.-.-* march of hur^an liberty
has never pauÂ»e<J.**'"9ftanTt pnuse nltw? Snail
the advance columns of freedom-seeking men
be retarded?
In the resolution I have offered I clearly In
dicate the; purpose I have In view. It is not
to abandon the present war until certain con
ditions have been reached, but to endeavor the
attainment of the conditions as quickly as pcs-
Â«iWe and then give to the Inhabitants of fhÂ«
Philippine Islan<* an epportunlty of creating
for themselves, as we <S!d In revolutionary
times, by evolution and self-exertion, the best
government possible for their kind.
Wellington referred to the part tha> peo
ple of his own State had taken in the war
with Spain, saying:
On that July mornin- the rlsln? sun whtch
heralded the destruction- of the Spanish naval
pmwer in Santiago Eay. as !t Illuminated thÂ»

And thoueh n^ v It seems to bÂ« the policy of
a cabal of one of the departments of thia Â«d
ministration to rob him of the grlory which
Justly Is his. the verdict of (he American pso
ple has been rfrordM. and he will go down to
history Â»â¢ the trua hero of that naval battle.
Wellington said a year had passed
since that great battle, "yet there Is no
Indication that we Intend to keep faith
with the Cubans, but there is every indi
cation that, by the power of syndicates,
cabals and combinations, there Is to be
continued in Cuba the despotism of a mil
itary government. In which the Cubans
themselves have no part, which Is beyond
the pale of any law save that of force,
and is not recognized by our constitution."
Wellington argued for Independence for
the Filipinos and said it would have been
better for U3, as a nation. If Admiral
Dewey could have retired from Manila
Bay on the morning after he had destroy
ed the Spanish fleet. But he had to re
main to suppress anarchy and chaos.
Wellington eald It was neither fair nor
just to attack the President or the ad
ministration for the conduct of the pres
ent war. During the Interval between tha
two sessions of Congres3 It was the Pres
ident's fluty to continue this war for ths
upholding of American authority on the
Islands. But the responsibility of the
President has ceased and is now upon
Congress. Mr. Wellington closed with the
statement that In his opinion his resolu
tion, if adopted, will conclude the war In
a manner both honorable and glorious to
the American nation as well as to tha

Fifteen Pilgrims in the Desert.
There was a grand time Wednesday
night In "â¢ Golden Gate Hall on
Sutter * street, for the nobles of
Islam Temple of the Mystic Shrine
were in session ; for the purpose
of celebrating the 'great feast known
as Moleedoos Seyyeedeh Kayneb, to per
petuate the charities of Imam's daugh
ter and" to convey over the hot sands of
the desert fifteen pilgrims who were anx
ious to ride the temple's well trained
camel, Ab del Kadber.
The hall in â¢ which the temple usually
holds its sessions being found Inadequate
to accommodate the 400 nobles who want
ed to see the work performed by the new
corps of officers, the main hall was se
cured and the events were most inter
esting to the onlookers and impressive,
so said the pilgrims, who laid much stress
on "Impressive." ' '
Reuben P. Hurlbut, the new illustrious
potentate, who, as commander of Califor
nia Commandery, led that body on Its
pilgrimage to Boston in 1895 and won great
praise for his management and executive
ability, introduced a number of new fea
tures that astonished the nobles.; The

BOERS MADE ONLY
FEEBLE RESISTANCE
SPEARMANS FARM, Natal. Jan. 18,
10 a. m.â General Lytelton's brigade,
with a howitzer battery, crossed the Tu
gela River at Potgieters Drift on Tuesday.
January 16. The water rose above the
waists of the men. The Boers fired two
shots and then recalled their forces to the
trenches, the passage being uninterrupted.
The. British advanced in skirmishing or
der, and the small kopjes on the summits
were occupied by 6:30 p. m. During the
night it rained heavily.
Yesterday (Wednesday) the Boer
trenches were vigorously shelled In front
of Mount Alice, while the British re
mained in possession of the kopjes and
plains.' Heavy mists enveloped the hills,
but the naval guns and' the howitzer
battery made good practice, thoroughly
searching the trenches. On the Boer right
a breach was made in a sandbag emplace
ment, where it is supposed Boer guns had
beeh' placed. Â¦ : . â¢
The cannonade was heavy and continu
ous, and the Boers were observed leaving
the trenches in small parties. The hill
facing the British position was shelled
next. ,
General Warren has forced a passage of
the Tugela seven miles west. - -
the Morgue autopsy surgeon, testified that
the organs of the dead woman were In a
healthy condition, and that there were
evidences of the work of a corrosive
poison.
Several friends of Sister Cora were ex
amined as to the probability of suicide
and they were of the unanimous opinion
that she never had contemplated and
never could contemplate committing sui
cide, for she was of a very cheerful dis
position and never spoke despondently of
her prospects or condition. . : â¢Â¦ .
The jury returned a verdict that- death
was due to carbolic add poisoning, but
whether taken with suicidal intent or not
was not determined.
KILLED WITHOUT WARNING.
Minority Verdict -Over the Remains
of Miss Lawler Blames Railroad.
" Coroner Cole held an inquest yesterday
on j the body of â¢ Miss Rose . Lawler, . who
was killed last Sunday by a train at the
crossing* of Seventeenth, arid "Harrison
streets. The evidence showed _that the
deceased .was crossing between / the two
tracks .. at - Seventeenth â¢ street, when the
locomotive whistle* tooted the danger sig
."nal and Mis:*". 'Lawler, being extremely
near-sighted, became confused - and In
stead of stepping -backward or, remain
ing where she was ' stepped in front of
the engine. She was caught by the pilot
and mangled under the wheels.
;. Ex-Assemblyman John J. McDade ap
peared for the relatives of the dead wo
man and drew out the ract-that the bell
maintained at the crossing. by the rail
road company to give Â¦warning of the ap

FIRST SYMPHONY
OF THE SEASON
â¢J Haydn - and , Tschaikowsky, Mendels
sohn and Wagner, ] the music of . the past
and the music of the future and two sym
phonies at a single Â¦; concert ! â¢ ;_ Such was
the programme "of the first of , the I series
of symphony concerts -under, the baton'
of Henri Holmes. The concert was heard
yesterday afternoon at the Grand Opera
house by a goodly audience.; Rather a
solid outlay and , one more trying and
severe to the musicians " than to their
hearers, who had ' nothing *to do but en-
Joy * themselves. . --â¢Â»â¢. *
.It might be surmised that the projectors
of I the -present series tl were j
dubious of tneir success: and were -berft
upon : offering as much -as possible at the
outset , In order, as it were, to carry the
day by force of arms. No one can object
to hearing the Tschaikowsky "Pathe-,,
tlque" at the Beginning of the season in*,
stead of ; having It withheld as a trump^'
card with which to take the last trick.l
and ; this ; ."demonstration" will undoubt-;
edly insure succes% for the present under
taking/ Whether or not the success will'
be deep and lasting, enough to vitalize
the symphony cult a year nence depends
entirely upon how successful Mr. Holmes"
may prove in winning the support ofrthd
outer circle of music patronsâ the public..
Yesterday's concert was really the>, first
test of Mr. Holmes' popularity, for he -Is
looked on now not as a possibility, but' as
a fact. He is installed as the ' lora t'of
our demesne of music and we must Be
gin to consider whether iie will stand, the'
test or not. With a capable band' and
ample rehearsals he has every advantage
that can be accorded him and the desire
for symphony concerts is strong enough
among us to supply him with at least
moderate support. Can he compass more,
than that is another question which the/
future alone can answer. -...-Â¦ '.'* . â ~\
Two aspects of the case present them
selves immediately in making an estimate
of his ability. On the one hand, there
is the orchestra admirably drilledâ a
token of his mastery â and on the other,
the question of his actual importance as
a conductor. I have nothing but admira
tion for the first, but regarding, the^sec-;
ond I can but repeat what I said- after
the first concert a month ago, to wit:
Mr. Holmes does not seem a vitally
component part of his orchestra; he does
not! dominate it; personally, he is negli
gible. He does not command attention,
and in consequence, we never find him
transcending the pale of scholarship and
endowing the music with individual char
acter. * -'* Â¦ Â¦. .* ? *â¢-Â¦/ .-,"Â¦ Â¦"â¢ . Â¦ v â¢Â¦:, . â
I Mendelssohn's "Ruy Bias--' overture was
a good introduction to yesterday's concert
and Haydn's buoyant Symphony in D,
No. 2, was interpreted with all the frank
joyousness characteristic of the compos
er. ; Its abundant melody, treated as it
is with the formality of other days, was
forgotten, however, when the orchestra
began to murmur the beautiful "Siegfried
Idyl" of- Wagner, and even the insinua
tion of this number was almost crowded
out of memory when the big Tschaikow
sky "Pathetique" raised its voice. The
composition is a tremendous piece of
work and has searching qualities, novel
ty, daring, marvelous complexity without
thickness, the appeal of modernity in a
radical age. It is inltinct with power and
devoid of sentimentality. The cumulative
rhythms of the first movement are su
perbly sensuous and in it the band played
with a truly fierce Impulse tempered by a
security and firmness of tone that was
delightful. The third movement, allegro
molto vivace, displays a marvelous hand
ling of themes and Is electrical in its
brilliancy. The final adagio sounds the
deepest note of sadness and is ineffably
pathetic.
It is to be hoped this symphony will be
repeated before the end of the season.
Indeed, if I had the space, I would like
to give some reasons why it might be
played at every concert of the series. *

The Louis James, Kathryn Kldder and
Charles B. Hanford combination will be
gin the second week of their successful
engagement at the Columbia Theater' on
Monday evening with "The. School for

Deputies Consider the
Strike Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PABIS, Jan; 18.â The promised interpel
lation-of the Government's attitude con
cerning\ the strikers of -St. Etlenne,Â«di
rected against M. Millerand (Socialist);
the Minister of Commerce, came up in the
Chamber of Deputies this afternoon and
resulted In a* victory for the Government.
The interpellator, M.' Gay, Progressive
Republican, representing fit. Etienne,
withdrew his motion at* the last moment.
M. Millerand, however, at the opening of
thevsession rot-e and said he refused to
rest. i under any allegation against him
that. he acted in favor of the strikers and
emphatically denied he had intervened in
the. strike without the knowledge ot the
Premier,- M. Waldeck-Rosseau. â¢ : - :
M. de Jeante. Socialist, then interpellat
ed the Government respecting the strike
in the Belfort region, alleging the Prefect
intervened in favor of the employers and
summoned the military to prevent the
workmen from striking. . He complained
that during the exodus 'of the strikers
to Belford the women and children were
compelled to sleep in the fields.
3JL. Salignac-Felon, Republican, here re
marked:. "Yes, but tba wire-pullers of the
fctrike 6ler>t a.t the bfst of the hotels."
M. 'de Jeante concluded his speech by
demanding protection Â¦ for workmen and
ehoating "Down with capitalists," â¢'Long
live the labor republic" This was greeted
Â»Ith loud Radical cheers.
M. Gay here resuscitated his interpella
tion, accusing, the. Government of toler
ating strikers' demonstrations, which, he
added, were due to its Indecision and in
sisting that M. Millerand intervened and
encouraged the strikers to resist their em
ployers' demands. ; *
M. Mlllerand replied, repeating his orig
inal statement and declaring that he in
tervened only to explain the operation of
the law regarding accidents to workmen.
M. Waldeck-RoKseau read the instruc
tions sent to the Prefect of the Loire or
dering respect for the right to strike and
liberty of labor. He continued with eulo-
Elelng. the conduct of the workmen's
unions,. which, in directing thÂ© strike, pre
vented excesses, from which the mining
Ftrike was laudably free. The vote was
then taken. â¢

WAR WITH JAPAN
IS INEVITABLE
Opinion of an Officer of

CHICAGO. Jan. IS.â "War between Rus
Â«ia and Japan is looked for as inevitable
by the naval officers of these countries
who have been nearest the probable scene

Romanoff of the Imperial Russian navy,
who arrived in Chicago to-day. The lieu
tenant has just completed a three years'
cruise In Asiatic waters on a Russian
battleship, the Slssoi Vcliky, and is on his
way to St. Petersburg. He contlned:
"just how soon such a war may begin
it is difficult to say. but events little short
of miraculous must occur to avert it. The
Japanese are building warships as rapidly
as possible. In anticipation of the out
break of hoptillties. and Russia is
strengthening her navy as fast as she can.
That Russia must have a naval base be
tween Port Arthur and Vladivostok is
certain. In the event of such a war it is
considered probable in Russian naval cir
cles that Russia will have the aid of Ger
many and that England will take the
other side. A European war will follow
the outbreak of hostilities between Russia
and Jupan.
"The movement of Russian tTOops to
ward the Afghanistan and .British-Indian
borders, the mobilization of Transcasplan
troops at Baku and Herat and other mili
tary maneuverings on the part of Russia
are taken by official Russia to mean the
beginning of a movement to eliminate
English influence in the territory hereto
fore held by her. beginning at Cabul. It
Is certain that England will have to light
to retain her territory in the East."

statue on behalf of the United States.
He said:
To George "Washington and his associates,
who in ITNT framed the Federal constitution,
we owe that great paper. Ii bound the thir
teen Independent colonies into a union and
created the United States of America. In it
they gave us tho ample letter and frame of
Kovernment. To the overwhelming arguments
nearly half a century later of Daniel Webster
in the Senate and to the luminoui sentiments
of John Marshall on the bench we owe Its de
velopment, by Interpretation and construction,
into the great charter of power which now
constitute the national authority. They Il
luminated Its letter with the national spirit.
They breathed into its frame the life of na
tional sovereignty. In the momentous debate
in which at that time they participated over
the measure of its grant of power â a debate
of giants â the Issue was between a limitation
on the one hand which would have narrowed
the growth of the young republic and endan
gered the union, and. on the other, an ex
pansion which Insured the Indestructibility of
the union and let free the republic to Its larg
est developments.
As they prevailed, so they made the re
public indissoluble by internal convulsion and
equal to the emergencies of the future which
confronted them, or which confront us. ThÂ«
ptatue of one of them, the Rreat JuriHt In the
porene diernity of his hl*h office, already adorns
the front of the Capitol. To-day, on Massa
c hu-Â»tiÂ» avenue, a name as dear to him aa
his to her, with his face to the Capitol and
to the Chief Justice, we dedicate the statue
of the other, the Kreat expounder of the con
stitution and defender of the union and the
foremost lawyer, orator and statesman, whose
words ImbÂ«"<lde<l tn the common political liter
ature of his countrymen, come to the tongue
like parsaces from the poets or the psalms.
I am deputed by the President to speak his
acceptance of the Rift thus added to the re
productions in endurlnp bronzo of those to
Â¦whom It hath been said. â¢'Well done."
Secretary Long's remarks were warmly
applauded and then, amid another out
burst of applause. Senator Lodge deliv

The formal ceremonies concluded with a
benediction by Rev, Mr. Couden, chaplain
of trie House.
Thn President and most of the other dis
tinguished guests next proceeded to Scott

was unveiled.

BIG RUSSIAN WARSHIP
DANGEROUSLY ASHORE
FASTENING GUILT
ON MOLINEUX
Â»
Jurors Tired of Expert
Testimony.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â Assistant Dis
trict Attorniey Osborne announced to-day
that the prosecution to-morrow would
close Its case against Roland B. Mollneux,
charged with the murder of Mrs. Kathe
rine J. Adams. The prosecution to-day
introduced two more handwriting experts,
who testified briefly that the handwrit
ing of the "Cornish" and "Barnet" letters
and of the poison package address was
identical with that of Molineux. Recor
der Goff ruled that the prosecution would
not be permitted to call any more hand
writing experts, and one of the Jurors
expressed his weariness of expert testi
mony.
The most important testimony to-day
related to the poisoning of H. C. Bar
net, and while Mr. Osborne was always
checked by the court when he asked his
witnesses questions that connected Mo
lineux with the Barnet case, still the
prosecution scored effectively.
James S. Hudson, a salesman formerly
associated with H. C. Barnet, testified
that late in the summer of 1898, shortly
before Garnet's death, Barnet received by
mail" a package about one and a haff
inches long and high, in a light colored
wrapper. Witness continued: "I saw
Mr. Barnet open the package. I saw him
take out the contents. As I recollect it,
there was some cotton, a smaller box
Inside and in it were some pink or red
capsules."
"How does all this become relevant?"
asked the recorder.
"I'll show," said Osborne, "that Bar
net received things anonymously through
the mails, iVid that this defendant bought
such remedies as have just been described
tn the name of 11. C. Barnet."
Edmund Barnet, brother of H. C. Bar
net, testified that among the latter's ef
fects were a small white box containing
fifteen pink pills, and also a box contain
ing a salve.
Dr. Robert Cooke. a homeopathic phy
sician of forty years' experience, testi
fied that small doses of cyanide of mer
cury, often repeated, would produce all
the symptoms of diphtheria,
Barnet. it v/as remembered, treated for
diphtheria. ":*
Other witnesses to-day were Vincent G.
Hammill, president of a private remedy
agency, who treated by mail the bogus H.
C. Barnet, alleged by the pr-^secution to
be Mollneux, for impotency, and who
testified to his correspondence with the
so-called Barnet, and William O. Inglis,
a newspaper reporter, who identified a
new "Barnet" letter to a Western medi
cal house, asking for a prescription. The
handwriting is identical with that of the
other "Barnet" letters.
STATUE OF DANIEL
WEBSTER UNVEILED
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 1900.
RAILROADS MAY
FORM A POOL
Plan to Keep Up Their
Earnings.
CHICAGO. Jan. IS.â The Tribune to
renrrow will pay: In order to carry out
their ami-commission agreement, it is
proposed now to combine all the railroads
Sn the country into a big passenger pool
and operate it in such a way that each
road will get an agreed percentage of the
earnings. 15y such action no profit
can possibly accrue to any ot the
roads by ignoring the agreement. Any
road that should manage to get more
than its allotted proportion would have
Its labor for its pains, as the profits
would go to the competing roads which
have failed to carry their proportion of
business. The Eastern roads have all
voted in favor of this scheme and a com
mittee of Western executive officials is
now at work to get all the Western lines
into the combination. This commission
is composed of: S. N. Felton. president of
the Chicago and Alton; Paul Morton, vice
president of the Athison, Topeka and
Santa Fe; J. M. Hannaford, president of
the Xnrthern Pacific; J. T. Harahan. vice
president of the Illinois Central, and J.
Kamsay Jr.. general manager of the Wa
baeh.
The railroad magnates do not admit
that the formation and maintenance of a
passenger pool would constitute a viola
tion of the law. It has always been the
contention of the railroads that the sec
tion of the Interstate Commerce act for
bidding pools relates only to freight
traffic and does not affect passenger busi
ness in any way. and it now seems to be
thoir determination to act and fight it
nut on this presumption. The fact that
President Felton of the Alton is chair
man of the committee insures the co
operaticn of the Alton and Union Pacific
roads, "which have been opposed to pools
heretofore. The Great Northern, which
always has been a stumblir.g-block In thÂ«
way of pools ;and steadfastly refused to
join combinations of that kind, is said to
have been won over.

ers- to all of the city printing, by virtue
of their organization and the language of
th" charter. This claim is disputed by the
Typothetae on the ground that the State
constitution, article I. section 21, says:
"Nor shall any citizen or class of citi
zens be granted privileges or immunities
which upon the wmi 1 terms shall not be
granted to nrl citizens."
The Typothetae claims to have both
union and non-union printers on Its rolls,
and strenuously objects to the city print-
Ing being given to union shops only.
The Supervisors will consider the com
munication at their meeting on next Mon
day.
Pretty boxes and odors
are used to sell such
soaps as no one would
touch if he saw them un-

soap that depends on
something outside of it.
Pears', the finest soap
in the world is scented or
not, as you wish; and the
money is in the merchan-
dise, not in the box.
All sorts of stores sell it, especially
druggists; all sorts of people are
crlng it.

CALIFORNIA'S RIVAL
IN THE WINE TRADE
W. BL BUNKER'S REPORT ON THE
OUTPUT OF FRANCE.
Secretary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce is In receipt of a letter written in
Paris by William M. Bunker of San Fran
cisco, who is representing the chamber
as its commissioner to the world's fair.
Mr. Bunker writes that France as a na
tion is paying but little attention to war
matters, but all branches of business are
figuring upon increasing their foreign
commerce. Of the fair he says:
The signs seem to assure the success of
the Exposition in all Its aspects, but most
clearly In a commercial sense. Every for
eign country Is utilizing every Inch of its
sectional space and the tremendous forces
of international rivalry are already at work.
In writing of the output of wine and
other products, Mr. Bunker gives some
Information of value to American pro
ducers In general and California vltlcul
turists in particular. He says:
Generally speaking, the year 1533 has been
kind to France. The crops were planted,
. cultivated and harvested with the thorough
Â¦ ness peculiar to this people, the manufac
turing Industries were proseruted with teal
and success, despite several larre strikes.
anÂ«l the exports in eleven months of 1533
were Â»13.Â«)0,OOO irreater than durlnsc a slm
â¢ liar period o f ig9g.
The wine product of 1 5 33 Is officially esti
mated at 1,;i53,f>.*0.W> gallons. (There are one
thousand million in a French billion.) In IS9S
the product .was under StCO.Oto.OOO gallons.
The value of wine exports! is placed at
J554, 000,000, and for Import*'! wines, mostly
' from Spain, France paid J60.000.000.
' The chamber's representative gives the
American people a little pood advice in
the matter of advancing their goods and
exhibits, saying that reference to money,
pamphlets, circulars, letters and carda in
the English language Is useless In Paris.
The French will not talre the trouble to
translate the language, and "as the
French system of, weights and the French
language are familiar to the people of
other continental countries, the impor
tance of this reference to language and
money can hardly be overestimated."

UNCLE SAM WILL NOT
MISS CARBOLIC ACID
DOES FOT NEED IT FOR USE BY
SOLDIERS.
Manufacturing of Lyddite Shells to
Destroy Boers in South Africa
Will Make the Fluid Scarce
Locally.
There may soon be a shortage of car
bolic add In this city. The story wired
from the East that the price has been ad
vanced 100 per cent Is confirmed here by
the wholesale druggists. The reason Is
that the British Government has decided
to prohibit the exportation of the acid
and has so notified all the wholesale drug
gists. The reason is that carbolic acid
figures In the manufacture of lyddite,
with which the British soldiers are shell
ing the Boers in South Africa, and the ex
tensive demand for lyddite makes it
necessary to keep all the acid at home.
Some interesting facts were learned yes
terday by talks with the local wholesale
druggists and manufacturers of explo
sives. The acid Is not used in any explo
sives made in this city either for blasting
purposes or for military use. Neither does
the United States employ it in the mak
ing of Its smokeless powder.
Langley & Michaels afforded the Infor
mation that the principal source of supply
of carbolic acid is to be found in the huge
gas and coke â¢ plants in England, the
larger ones being at London and Manches
ter. The acid is a bi-product of coal tar.
There are places in the United States
where carbolic acid is produced, but in
comparatively small quantities. Its prin
cipal use in the United States Is for dis
infection. Hospitals and the medical fra
ternity will find Increased bills In this di
rection. If the restriction in England
should continue long the result would
probably be to Increase the American out
put sufficiently to supply all demands.
There are other disinfectants that can bo
employed In lieu of carbolic acid, but that
has been the cheapest and the most con
venient and satisfactory for some pur
poses. Those who have a stock on hand
will profit by the sudden Increase in the
price.
OLYMPICS NO
MATCH FOR
SAILOR LADS
Are Defeated in a Tug-of-War
in the Club Gym
nasium.
A mighty cheer went up at the Olympic
Athletic Club last night when six sturdy
apprentices from the English ships In the
harbor defeated a like number of Olym
pians In a tug-of-war contest.
The contest took place on the smooth
floor of the Post street gymnasium and
the first trial of strength was won by
the Olympians. The sailors started the
red knot, indicating the center of the
rope, toward their side, but their oppo
nents pulled thorn over in one. long,
steady pull. The apprentices then shed
their heavy shoes, with which they could
get no hold on the floor. Their second
trial brought out their skill at the game
and they won handily. They also won
the third and decisive pull. The sailors'
team was made up of Dalman, Rhrin
ishch, Collins, Huggins, Butler and Fife,
The Olympics: Franklin. Mlddleton, Con-
Hn, Ft-nton. Bayly and King.
There were a number of boxing bouts,
In which there was some lively going. A.
Thompson of the Moana and F. MacDer
mld boxed three fast rounds. It was
stopped when the men warmed up.
Stewart Simpson and C. Mil ward- of the
Olympic Club showed marked cleverness.
Alfred Robinson and James Thompson
of the Moana and F. Peck of the Moana
and W. J. Leonard, Olympic" Club, also
donnr-d the big gloves.
F. B. Bayly and Clarence Pray, each
secured a fall in a wrestling bout. Chris.
Piersen of the Reliance Club and W. R.
McCullough of the Olympics had a sharp
encounter on the mat. Piersen, who
weighed IDS pounds to his opponent's 171,
won both falls, securing the first in flve
minutes and the second in eighteen. Mc-
Culloush was thrown with a crotch hold
the llrst time, and falling on his head,
was dazed. Piersen is a giant in size
and is muscled like a Hercules.
The gymnasium was crowded, a large
number of apprentices and tailors from
the ships in port being" the guests of the
club. They were looked after by the Rev.
H. W. L. O'Rourke of the Seamen's In
stitute, a firm believer In muscular Chris
tianity.
"Uncle" George Bromley was called up
on for an address and compromised by
singing several "chanties" familiar to
men of the sea. Mr. Fulton of the steam
er Moana contributed two clever songs in
good voice and style. |
TROLLEYS FOR HA WAII
L. P. Matthews, a prominent business
man of Cleveland, Ohio, who arrived here
a short time ago from the Hawaiian Isl
ands, left last night for his home. Since
hlB arrival here he has been traveling
aboui the State for pleasure, making the
California Hotel his headquarters between
trips.
Before his departure Mr. Matthews ac
knowledged that his recent trip to the
Islands was taken in the Interest of an
Eastern syndicate, which proposes to con
struct over 300 miles of electric roads in
Hawaii, at a cost of between $4,000,000 and
$5,000,000. Over $1,000,000 worth of ties and
lumber has already been contracted for
and will be 6hipped to Honolulu from Pu
get Sound. Most of the electric system
will be in and about Honolulu, and will
connect at its terminal with a ferry ser
vice running to the other islands. U'.ds
calling for estimates for the construction
of 310 miles of road have already been
asked for, and It will not be loner before
the work of building the road will be un
der way.
The first line to be built will run from
Honolulu to Kohala. a distance of about
130 miles, and is expected to cost $2,500,000.
MASKERS TO REVEL IN
MECHANICS' PAVILION
Maskers will hold high carnival in Me
chanics' Pavilion Saturday evening, when
the masquerade ball under the auspices of
the Commis Voyageurs will take place.
It is expected that the affair will surpass
anything of the kind ever presented in
this city. Two military band 3 will dis
course promenade and dance music during
the evening. One hundred commercial
travelers, representatives of the leading
houses of the coast, will act as a recep
tion committee and also lead the grand
march, which will begin at 10:30 o'clock.
The members of the committee will be at
tired In evening dress and during the
march will wear high hats. In their wake
will come 100 beautiful and shapely young
women dressed in gorgeous costumes of
ever}* country and description, and behind
them will follow the masqueraders. The
grand march promises to be the feature of
the ball, and it is more than probable
that hundreds of spectators will watch the
brilliant train winding its way around the
Immense ballroom.
The rough element will not be able to
gain admittance, as tickets have been
placed on sale at J5 each. Invitations
nave been extended a chosen few.

The track was very fast, accounting for
the fast time made in the different events.
Three rurses fell to favorites.
Garnet _-"ergnson"s recent purchase,
Li-n^rick. Â«ed his field a merry chase In
the opening sprint. A 7 to 5 favorite, he
broke away first and. never headed, won
easily from the 50 to 1 shot Racetto. Joe
McGee. the second choice, was unable to
Jingle Jingle a 10 to 1 snot, also made
an end-to-end affair of the six furlong
run following. At the wire he was ex
tended to beat the 3C> to 1 shot Sugden a
scant head. A very heavy play sent Alle
viate, the Shulte entry, to . Â» post favor
ite. Jenkins managed to get the mare
away well, but was cut off soon after the
start, ruining all chance of victory.
Throughout the betting Honig's mare
Theory ruled a consistent 3 to 5 favorite
for the third event, also Â¦ Fix furlone
da?h. Harry Thoburn made the running
to the stretch, where Theory headed him.
Thorpe then reserved Thobarn for a iir.iil
rush and. catching the first choice at the
paddock, beat her out three-fourths of a
length in 1:13 f.at. Clonsilla made a good
showing, downing Mountebank two
lengths for the show.
Fred Foster brought Tellowtail over
from Oakland, and he was supposed to be
"oil from the can" to beat Sardine ar.d
Timemaker. Starting a 9 to 20 choice, he
led when the paddock was reached, but
could not stand the clip. Jenkins here got
up with Timemaker. and. driving hard,
downed Sardine half a length, with the
"big fellow" nosed out for the dace. The
five ar.d a half furlongs was covered in
l:0C'i.
With nothing to beat. Bannockbum
made a gallop of the closing seven fur
longs. Oiinthus finished second, three

Aistrfct cf Alaska.. Heretofore it has been
bet a district, ur.der ccmtnar.d of Major

noest cÂ£ Cclurabia is at present tinder .
ccsima.nd cf the comn:anding general cf â¢
Urn Department of California, but it is a '
t -rarate military povernrr.cr.t. Its great- !
t-st importance arises from the fact that ;
it Includes Alaska, ani if that be taken .
tvay from it there is not much left for 1
U but to be made a part of the Depart- : :
ir.'nt cf California, and then the whole

Major Ray, who is now in command in Â¦
Alaska, is an cScer of long experience j
abeve the Arctic circle. He was in ccm- I
rr.and cf teveral of the early exploring
expeditions, tr.d when the time came to
make a military district of the territory
cf Alaska he was selected to take charge :
cf the organization. He is in ccrcmai-.d of
the district sow, ar.d it was a matter of
rarprUe to thc=e who know of his work
up there* that be was not given the com- :
rr.ar-d cf the department. Color.el Ran
dall of the E:srh:h Infantry has b*?n as
tigned to the place, and it is probable he
w:.l be given the rank of a brigadier of
volunteers in order that he may have a
rank suitable to the command. There '
was r,o obstacle In the way of making '
Major Ray a brigadier of volunteers, horc â¢ :
â¬ver. and his serx-ice in the North is I
considered trnple justification for such an
appointment.
Lfeeteuu* Co'.onel Richard I. Zskridge '
cf the Twenty-third Infantry will report ;
for duty at the Presidio, which m*ans ;
that he will take command, relieving Ma- i
2or Cowlts of the Seventeenth Infantry, i

In two wars, and he is known as a thor- !

PREPARING
FOR RACING
Track Athletes Already in
Training at University
of California.
BERKELEY, Jan. IS.â The decision of
the Associated Students of the University
Of California to send a track team East
this season lends an added interest to the
preparations now being made to be^in the
spring training.' The athletes are deter
mined to prove themselves worthy suc
cessors to the memorable team of 1595.
and more than one coast record is likely
to suffer during the season's work.
The first try-out will be the freshman
sophomore field day, the first Saturday
in March. The university championship
meet will occur about the middle of
March, to be followed two weeks later by
a dual field day with the team from Po
mona College. The Stanford meeting will
take place on the 21st of April.
A notable change on the track and at
the training quarters will be the absence
of the jovial and familiar presence of Al
Lean, the well known trainer, who is em
ployed elsewhere, yielding his position at
the university to George J. Hufferdine,
the champion swimmer. Mr. Hufferdlne,
when asked to-day about his method of
preparing men to contest in field and
track events, said he had no castiron rule
of training.
"Some men," he said, "must be worked
lightly; they are drawn fine and have
nothing to lose. Others require all the
work you can get out of them, but the
work should not be such as to strain them
in any way. Some athletes think they are
not in condition till they are hard as a
rock, whereas when a man is flt his
muscles should be quite supple."
â¢ The cinder path has been entirely re
modeled and is expected to prove much
faster than before. The training quarters
are now undergoing a thorough renova
tion, ar.d new training equipments will be
added by the time the men are ready for
heavy work.

SIGNING VOUCHERS FOR
CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS
SECRETARY SAYS REQUIRE
MENTS AR^ NOT OBSERVED.
Chief Civil Service Examiner Moran. ln
discussing the applications for positions
under the classified service called atten
tion yesterday to an important require
ment in regard to citizens who sign
vouchers testifying to the character and
ability of the applicant for preferment in
the civil service. The point is an impor
tant one in this, that unless the regula
tions concerning the proper signing of the
vouchers are strictly complied with it
may Jeopardize the position of the appli
cant.
Secretary Moran is of the 'opinion that
the requirements in the signing of the
three vouchers, which are printed on the
last page of the application blank, are
not being strictly adhered to. These
vouchers are to be signed by citizens who
have known the applicant at least one
year previous to the date of signing and
the signer Is supposed to have a general
idea of the qualifications and good habits
of the applicant. The vouchers are sworn
to before a notary public or some duly
qualified officer. Â¦*
"In many cases," says Mr. Moran "the
vouchers are signed by individuals whS
never met the applicant until they were
introduced by some mutual friend. Acain
prominent men have been induced to sleii
the vouchers on cllght acquaintance only
Th. applicant thinks if he has the names
of three well known citizens that the
weight of their good names will make the
securing of positions all the easier Noth
ing is further from the truth. It micht
militate against an appointee if the men
who vouched for him on mere hearsay or
slight information were called upon by the
commission to substantiate their recom
mendations contained in the vouchers I
would suggest that extreme care be used
inaugurated what may be described as sys
tematic advertising. His firm started out
with the fixed idea that advertising pays,
whether local or national, provided the re
quirements and policy of each individual adver
tiser are carefully studied, and proper caro
exercised in the selection of mediums . Its pol
icy was to convince not only the occasional
advertiser, but the non-advertiser as well, of
this fact. In this crnsade of education, it suc
ceeded beyond expectation, and although somo
of the theories and arguments favoring heavy
expenditure in advertising were regarded at
first as wild and unreasonable, its present
stauncnest adherents include many of its
earliest and most severe critics.
The close of the century is marked by tho
keenest competition in every line of business,
and failure to Judiciously advertise involves
being passed by more enterprising competitors.
Every year Nelson Chesman & Co. are con
sulted by firms which have either never adver
tised at all, or which have only advertised
spasmodically, and hence in a large measure
unsuccessfully. They are exceptionally suc
cessful in advising not only how and whero
to advertise, but what lines should bo mad*
specialties of.
Hard work for their customer's success is a
pleasure to them and while they may register
an occasional failure owing to conditions be
yond their full control they have been f ortnuate
in giving advice to their patrons and holding
and increasing their business from year to year.
They believe there is no necessity for re-
sorting t o
don btf v I

principlo
with them.
More than sixty experienced persons, exclu
sive of eight or len printers who set up adver
tisements and other matter on the premises,
are on the permanent staff of Nelson Chesman
A: Co., as compared with three or four in tho
firm's early days. To keep pace with this phe
nomenal growth the floor space of the head
office alone has been increased from 600 to more
than 7,000 square feet. More than $25,000 was
â¢pent for the building and for romodeling it for
their offices at St. Louis. They are one of two
of the agencies that own outright and occupy
their own building. The head office to-day is
one of the best equipped in the country, and
both branch offices are complete in every detail.
In 1878 Mr. Rowell retired from tho firm
which then became known as Nelson Chesman
& Co. For ten years it continued to extend
the scope of its operations. In February 1888,
it was incorporated under the same name, and
a branch was opened in New York City. Thres
yÂ«.ars later the Chicago branch was added. A
few months ago the New York office was dis
posed of, and a branch started in Pittsburgh,
Pa. All of tho offices have been phcuomenallj
Â«uccegBfol.
The officers of Nelson Chesman & Co. are all
well known in the newspaper world, as well as
among prominent' advertisers. The founder,
Mr. Nelson Chesman, has always been the
gniding spirit of the bouse during its long and
uninterrupted career, and is still its President.
The Vice-president and Treasurer of the com
pany is Mr. Conrad Budre. He secured a posi
tion with tho firm in 1877, and when it was
incorporated was elected Secretary and Treas
urer and placed in charge of the St. Louis
cilice as general manager. On September Ist
of this year Mr. Budke was elected Vice-
President and Treasurer. His lengthy con
nection with the advertising agency business,
as well as the excellent opportunities afforded
him of studying Mr. Chesman's honorable and
highly successful methods hare made him an
exceptionally valuable man to advertisers and
publishers, and his advice and Judgment are
ln constant request. Mr. Budke was succeeded
in the Secretaryship of the Company by Mr.
Richard Pendergast, another graduate in tho
advertising business who has teen directly
connected with the company since the year
1881. These three gentlemen constitute the
board of directors of the Company.
REPLANTING THE
DENUDED HILLS
Forest Rangers Begin
Work in the South.
Special r>lri>a.tch to The Call.
PASADENA, Jan. IS.â The much talked
of scheme for reforesting the mountains
has actually been started. Forest Ranger
Lewis Newcomb and assistants started
out yesterday with seeds of trees which
are now being planted. Ex-Mayor Theo
dore P. Lukens, ex-Mayor Calvin Hart
well and W. G. KerkofT of the Kerkoff-
Cuzner Lumber Company accompanied
Neweomb to direct the work which the
ranger will undertake. They went into
Millard Canyon, a few* miles north of the
city ln the Sierra Madre Mountains, and
they will be gone a week, during which
time they win clear a large area of the
burned over districts which were denuded
a year or two ago. When the party re
turns Newcomb will continue the work
with his assistants. The tree planted will
be I'inus tuberculata, which is practically
fire-proof when growing thick.
Mr. Luktne, wno is a nurseryman of
many years" experience, has been experi
menting with the new tree lor some time.
He built a cabin near Bear Valley and
gathered the seeds, planted, nurtured and
studied them. He brought this .to the
attention of the Forestry Reserve Com
missioners, together with a history of its
rapid growth and other qualifications and
it has been adopted for trial. An amount
of money sufficient to plant a consider
able arf-a has been secured.
In planting the trees there will be no
effort to have uniform rows. It is thought
that the b*et result* may be secured by
planting; the trees as they would ordi
narily grow. The seed will be thrust into
tho gTound and a stone placed at the
Funny fide of it to protect it from the
heat when the sprout is young and ten
der. The seed Is the same as that which
Mr. Lukens planted about his experi
mental station ln Bear Valley, where it
Is native and abundant. The seed which
Mr. Lukens planted a year ago ln that
neighborhood now make a fine showing.
He thinks that within a few years the
trees will cover the mountain side. It is
the hope of the mountaineers that when
the Government authorities see this rapid
growth they will be wise and plant all
the watÂ»Â»rehed denuded during the past
few years by the tierce forest fires. In
three years the tree will make progress
enough to be of value to the water sup
ply, says Mr. Lukens. because it will be
tall enough ln that time to hold the
ureamlets that otherwise flow away and
are lost Instead of sinking Into the
ground.
r.Sght a friend told her that Nealon.
who was also there, was showing a
pod watch to some laxly friends and
it resembled the missing timepiece.
Dora went to Nealon and. peeping
over his shoulder, said "That's my
watch," and made a grab for It. Nea
lon was ungailant enough to reply
"You're a liar." ar.d shoved the watch
into h'.s pocket. He left the hall and
Dcra followed him, and when she met
Policeman Noltlcg she told him the
Ftory, and N>a!on was arrested on a
charge of grand larceny. The case
was called ln Judge Conlan's court
yesterday and continued.
Kittie Alien, now Mrs. Gustave Bel
eel, related to Judge Mogan yester
day how she and her sister. Mrs.
Elizabeth Mark, had a f.ght on Ken
tucky street last Monday. "She was
Jealous of me." paid Kittie. "because
I wanted to marry Gus, and when she
raet me with my other sister, Mrs.
Berger. she kicked me and tore off my
hat. Then I let her have it."
man; 'deed he Is." The case was tak
ing too long for her, and she con
vulsed the court by shouting, "My
Gawd, Jedge, hurry up; I've got to go
and cook dinner for some white folks."
Mrs. Freeman nursed Mrs. Richmond
and wanted $2 50 fees, and when it was
refused she carried away with her the
articles ln question. "I made poultices
for that woman," she said, "and
washed her like a baby, and now she
won't pay me."
Mrs. Richmond denied that she owed
her anything, and they had It out In
court. Mrs. Minor joining in. There
was a. perfect babel of voices for a
few minutes, and the Judge tore his
hair ln despair, as he could not get
them to stop. The lawyers and two
policemen took a hand in the quelling
of the disturbance, and finally the
Judge, when there was a pause,
awarded the articles to Mrs. Rich
mond and $1 to Mrs. Freeman for
her services, and hurried from the
bench.
"What do you mean by that?" ask
ed the Judge.
"Well," said Kittie, "I hit her on
the eye and tore her hair. Yes, I was
married to Gus last Tuesday in Oak
laud. I want five months of being 18."
Mrs. Mack testified that Kittle
struck her first. She did not want
her to marry Beisel, as she was too
young. Kittie had been living with
her for some months. Mrs. Berger
was called, but she could not say who
etruck the first blow. She went with
Mrs. Mack to remonstrate with Kit
tie, who would have her own way, and
one word "borrowed" another until
they got to fighting and were ar
rested for disturbing the peace. As
both consented not to renew hostili
ties the Judge dismissed the cases,
and Kittie, with a smile on her face,
left the courtroom with her young hus
band.
There was an indescribable scene in
Judge Cabaniss' court for a few min
utes yesterday during the hearing of

Fcecia.l Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Jan. IS.-Manuel Gomez, a
young Mexican about 24 years of age. was
murdered early this morning near Ox,
nard. It is supposed that he was killed
by a companion named Raffael Caste
neado. also 24 years old. Major Carr, a
prominent beet sugar farmer, was aroused
about 1 o'clock this morning, and when
he went out he stumbled over the
body of Gomez, which lay in the
driveway some thirty feet from the
house. Gomez had been stabbed with a
sharp knife or dagger and was horribly
butchered. His ears were slit, his left
shoulder sliced and his neck was cut
open where the jugular vein was severed
This last jab was the direct cause of
death. He was bruised in general
Gomez and Casteneado imbibed liquor
very freely at Oxnard during lnst even
ing and toward night both departed to
gether for El Rio. When they reached
Carr s place, some two miles from Ox
nard. the stabbing affray occurred with
disastrous results for Gomez.
Gomez has served several terms ln the
County Jail, and is well known to the of
ficers. Casteneado has not been in the
county many months. As yet the assail
ant has not been captured, although the
officers are scouring the county for him
of himself. The fact that the Jewelry
and money of the deceased were mis3ing
gave rise to the belief that the deceased
had been murdered for the purpose of
robbery, and the police authorities were
notified.
The deceased was a member of one of
the best families in Hungary. He has
two brothers residing in the East and
another in this city. One of his brothers.
Geyza Perhacs, is the artist who painted
the picture of "Colonel Ingersoll in Hell"
and other notable canvases. Emll. an
other brother, is a minister. Another
brother is at present Inspector of Finance
ln Hungary.
An evening paper stated that the de
ceased was in the employ of Mr. Spreck
els. This is contradicted by one of his
relatives, who states that Mr. Perhacs
had been employed as steward ln the Pa
cific Union Club for five and a half years.
At the time of his demise he" was acting
ln the capacity of waiter at the San
Francisco Club. An autopsy was held
on the body last evening by Dr. Leland,
who announced that death was not due to
violence, but to natural causes.

PEOPLE WHO AMUSED HABITUES

FINAL ASSAULT
NOW MADE ON
SUTRO'S WILL
His Children Join in
Contest.
MRS. KLUGE FILES HER SUIT
BOTH SIDES CLAIM JSAT A
MISSING TESTAMENT EXISTS.
Former Mayor's Alleged Widow De
mands a Jury to Try the Issues
of Fact to Be Raised in
Defense.
Adolph Sutro's will, which by the Judg
ment of the Superior Court has been de
clared invalid by reason of the peculiari
ties in the trust clause and its ambigui
ties, was attacked anew and in force yes
terday. The aged capitalist's children,
with the exception of Emma Laura Mer
ritt and Charles Walter Sutro, have Joined
in a contest which was filed shortly be
fore 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Half an
hour later Mrs. Clara Kluge-Sutro's oppo
sition to the petition asking for the pro
bate of the will was placed on record.
In both contests it is alleged that tho
aged capitalist executed and published a
will subsequent to the testament of May
22, ISS2.
Mrs. Kluge-Sutro Included all allega
tions in her pleadings heretofore pub
lished in The Call, but added that she
was unable to state what search had been
made to find the last will mentioned, but
believes that it has been concealed, lost
or destroyed. She adheres to her conten
tion, however, that Judge William T.
Wallace and I. W. Hellman were named
therein as executors. Her ground of con
test is based 6olely on her contention that
the will is revoked by action of law, as
she, decedent's widow, was not mentioned
therein. ln addition to the decree of
court revoking the will on tile she prays
for judgment declaring that a subsequent
will was made by the deceased in 1595 and
that she was devised a widow's portion
therein, and that her children, Adolphine
Charlotte and Adolph Newton, were be
queathed one-fourth of decedent's entire
estate. She also asks for a Jury to try the
issues of fact raised by any answer to tho
petition.
In her petition Mrs. Kluge-Sutro Joins
all of the heirs at law, legatees, devisees
and claimants to decedent's estate. The
defendants are:

a will subsequent to May 22. ISS2, In the

At the date of the execution of the con
tested will, it Is alleged, Sutro was of un
sound mind and incompetent to make a

"At the time of the execution of the
document," the contest reads, "Adolph
Sutro was laboring under delusions con
cerning and relating to the contestants,
which delusions had no foundation in
fact, but could not be removed by argu
ment, proof or persuasion and the will
was executed as a direct result of these
insane delusions.
"The instrument was procured and
made by undue Influence exercised over
him by divers persons, who took advan

against the petitioners, their sisters and

Following these allegations the peti

REFORM GOING BACKWARD.
IN the course of a discussion between two well
known lawyers in the columns of The Call during
the latter part of November concerning the en
forcement of the civil service provisions of the new
charter one of the disputants gave it as his opinion
that the section which confers permanent tenure upon
all who secure appointments under the civil service
rules is unconstitutional. This attorney contended
that the limitation on terms of office imposed by tht
words of section 16 of article XX of the State or
ganic law, "But in no case shall the term exceed four
years," applies to all officials in the State of Califor
nia, county, municipal and State. In support of this
opinion he cited several decisions of the Supreme
Court.
But it appeared that none of these decisions were
modern, or, if recently rendered, that they^ were not
in point. The latest case cited was that of People vs.
Perry, which is published in the Seventy-ninth Cali
fornia Reports. In that action the Supreme Court
decided, that members of the Board of Health of this
city were "officers" within the meaning of the con
stitution and could hold office not longer than four
years.
The legal doctrine contended for, however, received
a few days ago ample support in the case of A. T.
Patton vs. the Board of Health, an action in which
the point was again raised for the purpose of main
taining perpetual tenure. Patton was a health in
spector. When the Burns politicians took charge of
the department early last year they dismissed him and
placed one of their own retainers in his place. Pat
ton applied for reinstatement to the courts, alleging
that the statute under which he was appointed pro
tected him during good behavior.
On December 29 the Supreme Court decided the
point, affirming the doctrine of the Perry case and
that of the others already referred to. The court
says in the Patton case that the health inspectors of
San Francisco are "officers" within the meaning of
the State constitution (section 16, article XX), and
that, as no term of office is fixed by the statute estab
lishing the Board of Health, they hold during the
pleasure of the appointing power/ but in no case for
a longer period than four years. Attorney Mc-
Enerney represented the Board of Health in this mat-
HOW IT WORKS IN LONDON.
SINCE the Mothers' Union of Gplden Gate has
begun a movement to enforce the law requir
ing employers of women to provide seats for
them in their places of business, it may be interesting
to note that the people of Great Britain are engaged
in watching the operation of a similar law. The
British act, which was passed last August, went into
effect with the beginning of the new year, and re
quires shopkeepers to provide seats for their female
assistants, under a penalty of a fine of three pounds.
It appears that in London many of the shops are so
small and are so crowded with counters and other
fixtures it has been difficult to find space in which to
provide the seats. As a result there has been a good
deal of ingenuity displayed in constructing chairs, or
stools that can be readily folded and put out of- the
way when not in use. *
â¢So great was the demand for seats of the kind
that ever since the passage of the act the furniture
factories have been busily engaged in trying to de
vise and construct them on improved models, and
there has been recently a "shop seats exhibition," in
which the public has taken a good deal of interest.
Over 200 models were displayed, and all of them, it is
said, are arranged on the automatic principle, so that
they fold themselves up or slide out of the way the
instant the person who has been occupying them
rises.
From the .alacrity with which the shopkeepers gen
erally have arranged to provide the required seats it
is believed there will be very few efforts made to
evade the law. In fact, it is noted that many shop
keepers provided seats as soon as the law was enacted
without waiting for it to go into effect. Still the
papers announce that several associations, as well as
the city officials, will, keep a lookout for offenders
and will promptly prosecute them when detected. As
the Chronicle puts it: "No doubt attempts will be
made to evade the* law, and it may be necessary to
convince the worst offenders that when Parliament
has passed an act for good and sufficient reasons it
must be obeyed, whatever the cost or inconvenience.".
The excellence of that sentiment is beyond dispute,
and it would be gratifying to have the California law
enforced with an- equal efticie'ncy.
It is said that Germany, anent the Bundesrath seiz-.
ure, has entered a strong protest to the British Gov
ernment It will probably be found to be made up of
limbcrger.

MOUTHPIECES.
WE regret that the administration seems to be
afflicted with what may be described as a
smallpox of "mouthpieces." Senator Beye
ridge was a recent addition to these oral afflictions,
and among them are several heavy burdens in the
shape of newspaper organs, which grind in ragtime,
to the disgust and sometimes fear of Republicans,
who apprehend the consequences to follow the dis
cordant and calliopean chorus of these mouthpieces.
One has come to hand which attempts to show its
loyalty to Republican principles by a half column of
severe abuse of Senator Hale of Maine for introduc
ing a resolution of inquiry into the British seizure of
American flour, in neutral bottoms, and bound for a
neutral port. Senator Hale desired the facts as known
to the administration to be put before the representa
tives of the people in Congress. The ships Mashona,
Beatrice and Maria were seized and were held so long
that the owners of their cargoes of flour may feel
some solicitude and other Americans engaged in
deep water commerce may share it. But the Sena
torial mouthpieces immediately joined their mouths
in obstructing Senator Hale's resolution, and he was
frowned upon as an enemy of his country. The news
paper mouthpiece referred to took it up, and with
fine scorn asked: "Does Senator Hale's gorge rise
at the remembrance of the service England rendered
this country when we interfered in Cuba's behalf?
The service was unsolicited, but important. From
the day the United States struck Spain until Spain
cried enough England pleasantly suggested to Europe
that there must be no interference." Therefore, it is
to be inferred, we must let England pirate our deep
water trade, rob our merchants, and must support her
also in piracy on the high seas against the commerce
of Germany and other countries with which we trad;
and are at peace!
The American people have not a scrap of evidence
that England held Europe off our back in the Span
ish war. If she did, and claim as an equivalent ser
vice our assent to search and seizure on the high
seas, against which we fought the war of 1812 and
whipped her, her moti%-e was sinister and her action
is not entitled to our gratitude nor respect. If we
were near by we would really suggest to Senator Hale
to rouse the mouthpieces again by introducing an
other resolution asking the administration to furnish
all the evidence in its possession that England
held our coat while we whipped Spain. The people
have a right to that evidence. They are continually
drawn upon in one way or another to drop a penny
in the slot as payment for that service, with
out v knowing whether it was necessary or was
rendered at aIL The special newspaper mouth
piece which does Senator Hale to a crisp for
daring to inquire into the piratical seizure
of three shiploads of American flour goes still farther
in an editorial roasting Englishmen for criticizing
the conduct of the war to destroy the two republics.
After praising the British soldiers this American Tori
paper says: "The man at home has his part to play
no less than the man in' the field. And he is playing
it but poorly by raising a premature and unreason
able howl about a situation that has not yet had time
to develop. He is giving aid and comfort to the
enemy. He is filling Oom Paul with encouragement,
for if President Kruger and General Joubert get the
idea that a change of Ministry in England means a
possible repetition of the Gladstone surrender they
will fight the harder and prolong the war to the ut
most in their power. Impatience has not hitherto
been recognized as an English trait, and this is no
proper time to take it on. To divide in the face of
the common enemy and engage in passionate quar
rels, with political advantage as the ultimate end.
would be poor and discreditable business for a great
people. The British soldier is full of fight, and who
shall say how soon it will be the other fellow's turn
to suffer?"
We hope that Goldwin Smith, Herbert Spencer,
Professor Bryce and other Englishmen who have
spoken with British bluntness about the republic
murdering business of their Ministry will be good
now, along v.ith Hale.
But the phrases are not yet put together which will
describe the renegade wretch who calls himself an
American and exudes Toryism from every pore.
The administration should suppress its fool friends.
If they continue to deny the right of our own people
to information in the possession of their Government
which highly concerns them, and to spit in the direc
tion of the English liberals and philosophers who do
not indorse the murdering of republics because they
own gold mines, the political row ahead to be hoed
will be longer and hotter than it needs to be.

history books may have to put our famous tea-party

ENGLISH PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS
OF A GIANT POLITICAL GAME
President Jordan's Recent Lecture on the Boer
War Arouses Warm Comments.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them fcr whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest.
Editor The Call: The Boers are
right. The English people are the
victims of a gigantic political
bunko game. The ancient roots of
the present bluster were sown by
James I. It has been carried on by
Disraeli, Chamberlain and Cecil
Rhodes, who is" a sort of Boss
Tweed in South Africa. As a rule
Ensland never stirs up actual hght
ing if the people on the other side
have clothes on. Chamberlain has
England in his power. The basis of
England's policy is inequality
among men. It ha 3 always been so,
and that is why our forefathers left
England. Her idea of a foreign pol
icy is never to strike except wnen
the enemy is down and has no pow
erful neighbor, and never to strike
below the belt when the vulnerable
points are above. Chamberlain says
there must be English supremacy
in South Africa. We could say the
same thing about North America.
Why has not a little people as
many rights as a mighty people?
The peopla who are talking to us
now about brotherhood and cousln
ehip are the same 6table boy aris
tocrats that flouted at Abraham
Lincoln. There is no justification
for a mighty nation to go. to war
with a weak one. All claims of
suzerainty were given up by Glad
stone, and I say he did the square
thing by a little nation. The out
siders had no right to vote in the
Transvaal. The war started with
Jameson's raid and the English .
would have followed and taken in
the whole country if he had been
successful. Every nation that has
grown in strength has grown in
peace, and every nation nas gone
down in arms. The policy of op
pression must give way to sobriety,'
industry and justice.
The above are brief extracts from the
telegraphic report of an address delivered
in the city of Oakland on the 12th inst. by
David Starr Jordan, president of Stan
for University. That they are as true as
gospel is a great pity. Yet it were a
greater pity that we should not be thu3
frank with our "British cousins." For us
to openly or silently approve or extenuate
Britain's .present work in South Africa
would be a grave crime against all hu
manity. We could not afford to so de
grade our national conscience, if we still
have one. Free. America would be reo
reant in her sacred duty to the world were
she to fail in speaking the truth and the
whole truth concerning the great wrong 3
that England has heaped and is heaping
upon- the heads of these puny South Afri
can republics. â¢ God forbid that America
should with open eyes and sealed lips
stand aloof while England enacts this
wicked tragedy, a crime so appalling, so
reprehensible that words are inadequate
to express the horror and detestation felt
by onlookers. And all for the sake of the
blind and insatiable greed which sur
rounds, permeates and envelops England
like a loathsome malady.
These sturdy South African Dutch, chil
dren of freedom-loving ancestors, honest
liberty-loving sons of the veldt, who in
the face of a thousand dangers hayÂ«
carved out their homes in the wilderness
and desert, have surely established their
unquestioned title to their freedom and
Independence, for which they are so
bravely battling. Those who will take the
trouble to look into the history of South
Africa will find that there is no doubt as
to the righteousness, the justness of the
Boer cause. The South Arican republics
have been brutally dragged into the arena
of cruel war in spite of their oft-repeated
wishes for peace. It hardly seems possi
ble that the great body of the common
people in England can realize the atro'Vty
of Chamberlain's South African war pol
icy. It would seem as though they had
closed their, eyes to moral responslblUty
and permitted themselves to be blindly
led into the quagmires of national dis
honor at the hands of the will-o'-the-wisp
ambitions and hare-brained ideas of Jo
seph Chamberlain and Cecil Rhodes. These
ttvo are the chief conspirators against
whom (and their willing tools) England
must charge up the heavy account m
blood and treasure that is being reeled off
for her in Southern Africa. They appear
to have little care or concern as to what
depths of degradation they may lead their
country so long as their unholy schemes
are duly executed.
Candidly speaking. Chamberlain and
Rhodes both deserve to be shot or hanged
and their memories forever execrated for
the dishonor, the awful misery, suffering
and loss of lift* which they have brought
upon England alone, to say nothing of the
monstrous Iniquity against the South Af
rican Dutch. Such an end for them would
be but a mild expiation (not a thousandth
part, of a just expiation) for the deviltry
which they have deliberately planned and
set in motion.
None will gainsay the truth of the say
ing that "war is hell." It is all that even
when it is Justitied. An unjustifiable war
waged by a gigantic professional military
power against innocent, puny republics
composed of farmers and shepherds,
whose only sin is that they happen to hon
esty possess that which the greed of the
giant covets, is too diabolical, too fiendish
for words to express.'
The light of God's eternal truth turned
full upon British pretence shows no
semblance of honest Justification, no rea
sonable defense for Britain's crimsoned
hands. In deepest sorrow, with feelings of
sincere pity and profound humiliation we
well may ask, "Is it possible that Eng
land's guilty. Etains can ever be efface.] '"
She is writing one of the blackest pa~es
of history, for which her honest sons will
ever hang their heads in shame. It is no
small or trivial matter, to be lightly con
sidered or lightly dismissed.
An individual who is so crazed with lust
for land, gold or power that the killing
of his brother man is as nothing to him
If thereby his greed be satisfied, is indeed
a sorrowful, a pitiful spectacle. How in
finitely worse when a nation, drunken
with avarice, halts not at the wanton de
struction of innocent weaker sister na
tions for the mere gratification of this
same greed for "more."
There are thousands upon thousands
throughout America who are earnestly
hoping and as earnestly praying that* a
Just Providence will so sustain and guide
the weak that that child of the devil
"Chamberlainism in South Africa " shali
be smashed to pieces, that right shall Dre
val at , tb Jv t bra . ze "-'aced might shall falter
and be lost. thatrÃritish avarice and Brit
ish arrogance with all their attendant
evils, shall be driven In deserved disgrace
from the soil which they are desecrating
It does not seem possible that the Al
mighty will permit England's- house to
endure when she persists in such stupend
ous wickedness.
A national house builded out of the
groans, tears and blood of the innocent
is a baleful and uncanny structure, and
should not stand. Â«

Jan. 15, 1900.
THE LAND LEASE BILL.
THERE are two bills before the Senate affecting
grazing lands. One, by Clark of Wyoming,
seems a futile measure. It gives homesteaders
on abandoned military reservations the right to enter
160 acres in addition to their homestead holding for
pasture or grazing land, providing that grazing land
so entered shall be unfitted for cultivation and home
stead entry "by reason of lack of water for irrigating
purposes or otherwise." The ambiguity of the
proviso is noteworthy, and the measure is subject to
criticism from the fact that 160 acres of the totally
arid r.ature required to qualify it for entry would not
feed one steer. The purpose of the bill is therefore
obvious in its text and lies far away from the one ex
pressed.
The other measure is by Senator Foster of Wash
ington, Senate file 1947. It provides for leasing
lands suitable for grazing only west of the ninety
ninth meridian. The Secretary of Agriculture is to
determine whether such lands are more valuable for
grazing than for any other purpose, and they shall be
located, listed and described in terms enabling their
lease by definite xnetes and bounds. The minimum
rental shall be one cent per acre. No limit is put
upon the area that may be leased to one individual,
except that each leasehold shall be for the smallest
erea compatible with the best utilization of the land
for grazing purposes. Leases shall be made only to
citizens of the States in which the leasehold is lo
cated, or to corporations organized under the laws of
Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of Ag
riculture it is to the interest of the United States to
consolidate areas for grazing purposes to lease under
this act, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to
exchange public grazing lands with the States, or pri
vate owners, for other grazing lands of practically
equal value.
wo provisions of this act seem sinister and should
receive attention in committee. A corporation may
become resident and receive leases. A natural per
son mu=t be resident in same State with lease
hold. Nothing in the bill gives protection or prefer
ence to present owners of herds. Under the bill cor
porations with foreign stockholders may lease all the
lands in any grazing region while not owning a hoof
of stock. To trespass on a leasehold is a misdemeanor
punishable by fine of $500 and six months in jail.
Therefore such a corporation, having leased the
lands, will have the owners of cattle at their mercy,
punishable for trespass and compelled to let their
herds starve or sell to the corporate leaseholder at
any price the corporation may choose to pay. In
this way the half-dozen large meat-packing corpora
tions can not only control the ranges, but take the
herds now grazing on them at their own price. The
bill should safeguard the herd-owner and not
his possible despoiler. The other sinister feature is
the exchange of lands with States or private owners.
In working it will easily be the means of transferring
to the United States ranges that have been over
stocked and fed out in exchange for others which,
while "practically of equal value," are fresher" land'
zv.d not exhausted of their forage.
The Western cattle-owners will do well to pay some
attention to the questionable features of the bill and
secure their amendment in committee. If they do not
they may wake up to find their ranges leased to cor
porations and their property at the mercy of stran
gers.
The revenues of the bill are to go to the States, to
be used by their Legislatures for water storage and
irrigation.
DODGE'S LATEST DODGE.
ZIJVER since the new city government began the
people have been treated to a continuous show
â * of dissolving views. The bright pictures which
were presented to the voters during the campaign by
the Phelanites have been one after another fading
into gloom, leaving in their places about as black
prospects as the people of this city ever looked upon.
It appears we are not to have even the economy
that was promised. The administration cannot con
duct 'the affairs of the city on the dollar limit levy
upon the assessment stated in the campaign pledge,
and has begun to seek a means of evading it. It is
characteristic of men that instead of honestly
acknowledging their error and dealing frankly with
the taxpayers they are endeavoring to obtain more
money by a sort of flim-flam game, and have sought
to induce the State Board of Equalizers to act as con
federates in the scheme.
Assessor Dodge's proposition to the Equalizers is
perhaps the most extraordinary ever made by one offi
cial to another. He informed the board that -after
having gone over the subject carefully with the
Mayor the two had agreed that the only way by
which a sufficient revenue could be procured to defray
the expenses of the municipal government under the
new charter, with a tax levy not exceeding $i on the
$100, was to increase the assessment of property to the
extent of $100,000,000. They wish that assessment for
the city, but are not willing the State should have the
benefit of it, and accordingly they ask the State
Equalizers to agree to reduce it to the original
amounts when they equalize taxation for State pur
poses.
Such being the scheme of the Assessor, it becomes
a matter of concern to the taxpayers to know upon
what classes of property he proposes to make the
$100,000,000 of increase in assessments. When asked
by the Board of Equalization if he intends to put the
increase upon corporations the Assessor answered:
"No; the corporations are assessed up to the limit.
We propose to place the increase on realty."
From that statement it appears that if the scheme
go through the homes of the people will be burdened
with an assessment for taxation under the new charter
$100,000,000 in excess of what was imposed upon them
in the past. The Assessor, who was so loud in his
declarations during the campaign of an intention to
make the corporations pay more taxes than they have
been doing, now laughs at his promises, mocks at the
people who trusted him, and proposes to let the cor
porations alone and heap up the burden upon the
owners of real estate.
It is hardly likely the State Board of Equalization
will consent to take part in the trick which the in
genious Dodge has devised. If that sort of game' be
permitted to one county it will be imitated by others
where unscrupulous men obtain the office of Asses
sor, and the consequences will be unceasing scandals
in which the Equalizers themselves, will be involved.
The trick is an outrage and should be so treated.
LAST night "William Schuyler Moses, superintendent of the Masonic Cem- C
etery of this city, known throughout the Masonic world as "Uncle <
Billy" Moses, paid his fiftieth annual visit to California Lodge, Free <
and Accepted Masons, In the Masonic Temple. He visited that lodge for J
the first time on the 17th of January, 1850. in a two-story frame building on <
the east side of Montgomery street, between Jackson and Washington, which <
was the first Masonic hall in San Francisco, and of which a sketch is fur- <
nished, with the portrait of the Masonic veteran. <
Since that flrst visit it has been the custom of Mr. Moses to call on Call- *
fornia Lodge on or as near the 17th of January as possible. When he entered *
the hall last night he looked around in vain for the brothers who greeted
him with a fraternal welcome fifty years ago. So far as the Masonic records (
go, he will be the last of the group of Fellowcraftsmen who occupied stations ,
in or faced the East when he entered the dimly lighted lodgeroom. All have <
passed to the great beyond. The last one of thai band of pioneers to extend <
the hand of fellowship to him in the lodgeroom was the late Colonel Jonathan. Â«
D. Stevenson, who passed away February 15. 1534. The worshipful master |
who presided on that occasion of that first visit was the late Levi Stowell, who J
afterward became the secretary of the Grand Lodge of California. <
Uncle "Billy" Moses was born in Rochester. N. V., August 8, 1527. and came <
to California on the bark Alice Tarlton, arriving in San Francisco Bay <
January 11, ISSO, after a passage of nearly nine months around the Horn. A (
carpenter and millwright by trade he went into the far north of the State 4
and made the beautiful Corinthian columns for Esmeralda Lodge Instituted ,
In Aurora, then in Mono County, but now in Esmeralda County, Nev. He re- <
sided for a time in Yreka, where he was secretary of the Fire Department and <
was a Town Trustee. In 1555 he returned East for a short time and there <
married Miss Addie Warren of Fredonia, Chautauqua County, N. V., and *
returned to California. He is a member of the Astronomical Society *
of the Pacific Coast, and for many years held the office of marshal {
of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was initiated in Valley <
Lodge In Rochester, N. V., February 13, 1543. passed to the degree c
of Fellowcraft March 5; one week later was raised to the sub- <
lime degree of Master Mason. On November 8, 1552, he was appointed wor- *
shipful master of Golden Gate Lodge under dispensation, and was elected to c
that office when the lodge received its charter and he has been a member of
that lodge ever since. Of the charter members of that lodge only three c
are alive, George J. Hobe of this city. Rev. John F. Damon of Portland and <
Mr. Moses. C
The veteran Mason is a member of San Francisco Chapter, Royal Arch Â«
Masons, a member of California Comrnandery. Knights Templar, having
been created a Knight Templar and a Knight of Malta in l&sS. and is past Â£
venerable master of Yerba Buena Lodge of Perfection of the Ancient and Â«
Accepted Scottish Rite, past wise master of Yerba Chapter of Ro3e Croix. c
almoner of Godfrey de St. Omar Council of Kadosh and past grand chancel- Â«
lor and venerable grand master of the Grand Consistory of California. He O
was elected a knight commander of the Court of Honor of the Supreme Â£
Council of the Thirty-third degree for the southern jurisdiction, and on the +
unanimous recommendation of the Grand Consistory of this State he received o
the order and jewel of Kr.lght Grand Cross, thirty-second degree, being â¢?
the first and only one in California to receive that honor from the Supreme O
Council. He is an active member of the Masonic Veterans' Association and la "*
past most venerable master thereof. He is also a noble of Islam Temple and Â°
the founder of the Order of the Eastern Star in this State, having instituted +
Golden Gate Chapter under commission as deputy grand patron of the Su- O
preme Grand Chapter in May, 1869. He is also a noble of Islam Temple and Â¦?Â¦
first matron. In recognition of his services to that order he was recently O
created venerable pasi grand patron of the Grand Chapter of California and +
was presented -with a beautiful jewel indicative of that rank, created sped- O
ally for him and which will become extinct when he shall have laid down the Â¦?Â¦
burden of life. Â°
ter. He also represented the victorious party in the
Ferry case. Thus it appears that his^theory that no
official in California of any class whatever can hold
office for a longer period than four years has been
thoroughly established, and, moreover, applied to the
municipal subordinates of this city.
The doubt thus resolved makes the permanent
! tenure provisions of the new charter unconstitutional
I and renders the whole civil service system created by
! the instrument nugatory and void. Of what use will
I it be to establish the merit system of appointment to
office in this city if, at the end of every four years,
there is to be a wholesale removal for political pur
poses? The new charter places the Civil Service
; Commission entirely in the hands of the Mayor. That
, official is authorized to appoint two Commissioners in
j each term, and thus can always bend it to subserve
j his political purposes. The restriction on terms,
| moreover, applies to the Police, Fire and School de
| partments, which are brought by the charter under
j civil service rules.
Some of the new charter "reformers" who, in the
j mad pursuit of office, have forced these uncertainties
! upon us, should now inform a suffering public what
| they think they have gained by throwing the entire
i government into the spoils vortex while attempting
ito establish an unconstitutional merit system. The
j issue as to the tenure of policemen, firemen and
j schoolteachers would never have been joined had not
j the new charter set up civil service reform. Now it is
' inevitable.

THE CHIEF OF POLICE.
Ban Francisco Trade Jsurcal
So far as we can learn tha friends of
Mayor Phelan in the business community
regret his course In the controversy over
tha appointment of Chief of Police and
his evident stand in favor of Esola for tfca
position. They think that by so doing ha
phadows the good record he made while
Mayor under the old charter, which will
react against him in the future. One cf
his former strong admirers says that the
mercantile -and manufacturing interests
of San Francisco are largely interested in
a pure municipal government in ail its
branches and to subordinate any one of
them to other interests ia calculated to
undermine the main dependence for secur
ing it. He further says that if ilayor
Phelan is honest in hta course to promote
a higher standard for the Police Depart
ment, he would unhesitatingly say that he
Is In favor of any good aid reliable person
for Chief of Police, without regard to
party or politics and In the absence of
such a statement over his own signature
the general public will uzdoubtedly be
lieve there has been some 'â¢dnd of collu
sion to promote Esola to the position. The
latter may be all that his iriends claim,
yet the charges made agalm him will
leave a stain and be proniotve of Intro
ducing more or less discord in the depart
ment and, besides, lower mher than
raise its standing with the coarnunity at
large. It U to be hoped that in the Inter
est cf the city at large and the cause of
pure municipal government tkit Mayor
Phelan and the Board of Police 7omrÂ£ls
sloners will choose a person for 7aief cf
Police against whom no charges can be
preferred and who will fyi the icsitlcn
with, credit to all in Interest. Thre are
plenty of such men and there is nt good
reason why one should not bÂ« e>osen
from among them.

6TARIFF ON MIXED GOODS.
Decision by the General Appraisers
of Interest to Merchants.
The United States General Appraisers
have notified Port Collector Jackson
where dutiable goods are Indiscriminately
mixed with goods free of duty a collector
of customs has the right. In the first in-
stance, to assume that the mingling of
the goods was Intentional and with de
sign to evade the customs revenue lawn.
No duty rests upon him to separate t^e
goods accordlngto their dutiable charac
ter, and he is justified in treating the en
tire Importation as prima fade dutiable.
When the eonfuslon of the goods is acci
dental, and not fraudulent in fact, tha
burden tests upon -the importer to prove
that such is the case, and as to what
portions of the grods the classiticatlon of
the collector is incorrect, which proof
may be made before the Board of General
Appraisers when the question has been
properly brought before them by protest.
FRANCHISE FOR COAST ROAD.
Street Committee Considers the Ap
plication â Objections to Bock
Crusher.
The Supervisors* Street Committee met
yesterday morning and was addressed by
Attorney T. D. Riordan regarding the
franchise asked for by the Bay and
Coast Railroad Company for an entrance
In this city. Mr. Riordan stated the fran
chise sought by the company was identi
cal with one granted some years ago to
another concern, but no tracks had ever
been constructed and the former fran
chise had lapsed. He also contended that
the matter Is not governed by any pro
vision of the charter, but is under the
State law.
Further consideration was postponed
for one week, or until the City Attorney
files an opinion as to tbe powers of the
Supervisors to erant the franchise.
A number of Mission property owners
appeared before the committee In behalf
of a protest of the Federation of Mis
sion Improvement Clubs against the
maintenance of a rock crusher by Gray
Bros, in the vicinity of Clipper. Douglass
and Twenty-fourth streets. M. Rooney
testified that tallinsrs had gathered on hbs
premises to the depth of five feet, and
that his tenants had been obliged to move
by reason of the nuisance. Messrs. Plum
mer, Matthews. Hyman, L.llle, Connors
and Mrs. Booth also spoke of the rock
crusher as a nuisance.
Mr. Gray, owner of the machine, said
that If the plant were condemned it would
throw several thousand men out. of em
ployment.. As long as Mr. Rooriey was
on the payroll he made no objection. The
matter is now In the courts and the bonds
are sufficient to cover any damages. The
last board had visited tho quarry and
were satisfied with its workings.
The committee concluded to visit tha
quarry next Saturday at 2 p. m.
It was derided to have Trocadero Gulch
filled in with the residue of sand from,
the grading of Nineteenth avenue by the
City Street Improvement Company, as
this method will reduce the cost of tho
proposed improvement.

Do you want health?
Then keep your bowels clean and your
liver lively!
It has always been known that constipa-
tion is the cause of nearly all disease, but
the way of treating It has changed.
The old way was to make up a sickening
"black draught," or, still worse, an explo-
sive "shotgun" cartridge of calomel, aloes,
jalap, gamboge, croton oil, blue mass,
colocynthâ the larger the bullet the better
âand after the patient had swallowed the
dose, thrown the bowels into spasms and
turned the liver inside out, he was settled
for a few daysâ frequently forever.
The most dangerous "medicine" of all
was the mercurial pill-poison which
lodged In tho blood and joints, producing
life-long aches.
Force is folly, if you have any regard
for you well being. When it becomes
necessary to stir up your liver and have a
general Internal cleaning up, take Cas-
carets Candy Cathartic, and produce nat-
ural action in a nice, gentle, quiet, posi-
tive way.
Cascarets are up to date, antiseptic,

STEAMERS AND
WINDJAMMERS
IN COLLISION
Apache Damages the
Dawn.
PILOT BOAT'S CLOSE CALL
HAWAIIAN BARK HIMALAYA
DAMAGED IN A STORM.
A couple of collisions occurred yester
day morning on the bay, but in neither
was there much damage done. The Sac
ramento River steamer Apache backed
down on the 6loop Dawn while making a
landing at Mission-street wharf. The
Dawn was tied up to the wharf and the
Apache crushed her up against the piles.
The little sloop was badly strained by
the squeeze and began to leak so fast
that the captain and crew got ashore in
a hurry, thinking she was going to sink.
The cargo was got out of her as quickly
as possible, however, the steamer men
lending a hand. The Dawn will be le
paired by the Southern Paciilc, owners of
the Apache.
The other collision was between the
steamer South Portland and the pilot
boat Lady Mine. The boat was chafed a
little and had her rigging damaged, but a
few dollars will pay for the necessary re
pairs. The South Portland arrived from
Departure Bay with a cargo of coal, and
was hove to off Meiggs wharf awaiting
the Custom-house officer. She got across
the tide, and before Captain Hall could
get her straightened up again she ranged
alongside the Lady Mine. By skillful
handling the South Portland was got
away with a minimum of damage.
The Hawaiian bark Himalaya, which
left here September 3 for Melbourne,
Australia, had a very rough trip across.
Heavy weather accompanied by a nasty
cross sea was encountered. One of the
seas that broke aboard carried away half
the deck load of lumber, two of the
water tanks and the bulwarks,
and did other damage. The Himalaya
carried from here 573,575 feet of lumber
and a small general cargo, all of which
was valued at $31,312.
The ship Alexander Gibson sailed yes
terday for New York with a very valu
able cargo. In all she has 6200 tons of
general merchandise aboard. Nearly all
of it is California products, all of which
are in great demand in the Eastern mar
ket. There is a large consignment of
wine among the Gibson's cargo, some of
which is the finest vintage that has ever
left the port. Captain Holmes, who take 3
the Gibson around the Horn, is the oldest
and best posted shipmaster afloat. He ex
pects to make a good run to the Horn,
and If he has his usual luck in rounding
the cape hopes to make New York in
about 110 days. '
There are no ships to carry goods to
Honolulu and the merchants and shippers
are in a quandary. Nearly the entire
fleet â¢of sugar boats is detained at the
islands waiting for sugar and In conse
quence there is nothing to carry the thou
sands of tons of freight now awaiting
shipment. Yesterday the E. B. Sutton.
which arrived here from Philadelphia on
the 7th inst., was put on the berth and
will take a full cargo to Honolulu. Should
the quarantine \>Â¥ raised by the time she
reaches the islands and is discharged, she
will load sugar for Philadelphia.
The Mall Company's steamer Newport
sailed for Panama and way ports yester
day with a very large cargo. The com
pany has started a rate war and succeed
ed in getting some freight away from
the Kosmos Company's steamer Volum
nia. which is due here next Wednesday
from IJamburg, via South and Central
American ports. This fact does not worry
the Kosmos people, however, as their
steamer will be packed with every ounce
of merchandise she can carry leaving
here.
11. F. McMullin, formerly chief engineer
of the Rio de Janeiro, went out as chief
engineer of the Newport, vice H. W.
Dixon, who will remain ashore for a few
trips.
Lauterries' shipyard at Sausalito Is no
more. The owners of the property have
refused to renew the lease, so the old
place Is being torn down and removed
piecemeal. Lauterries was known to
every yachtsman on the bay and they are
all wondering where the old man will
relocate himself.
As predicted, the old bark Ferris S.
Thompson has been libeled not only by
the Western Union Telegraph Company,
but also by Gray & Mitchell, charterers
of the steamer Homer. The Thompson
went to Puget Sound under a "lump
sum" charter to bring down a quantity
of telegraph poles. Finding he would
have to make three trips in order to
handle the consignment, Captain Murk re
fused to have anything to do with the
Job and went to Port Blakeley. where he
loaded lumber for San Francisco. On his
way into port he got In the "Potato
Patch." where he lost tha vessel's anchor
and chain. The Homer came along and
towed the Thompson out of her dangerous
position and into port. The Western Union
hod to charter another vessel to go after
the telegraph poles and it has libeled
the bark for the difference in the charter
money and damages. . Gray & Mitchell
libel the bark for salvage.

SterÂ» were taken yesterday at an !m

to put an end to the expensive litigation
In which the teachers and merchants have
l^en ci;Â£Â£ged for the past year over the
question as to whose demands shall tako '

of the merchants, aggregating nearly
I â¢'.'.. and about 50 per cent of the unpaid

It was stated at the outset of the meet

CHICO, Jan. 18.â The second annual
meeting of the Pacific Retail Hardware
Association helds its final session here
to-day. The meetings were held In the
commodious Knights of Pythias Hall and
were attended by practically the entire
membership numbering something over
sixty of the leading hardware dealers of
Northern California. The work accom
plished by the association during the past
year ' was reviewed In executive session
during the first day and such details at
tended to as the year's experience had
shown expedient. An election of officers
for the ensuing year was held and the fol
lowing named gentlemen were unani
mously chosen to direct the affairs of the
association:
President, John C. White of White,
Cooley & Cutts, Marysville; vice presi
dent, Oscar C. Schulze of Epplnger &
Co., Dixon; secretary, Robert W. Boyd
of Hampton Hardware Company, Marys
ville; treasurer, W. M. Earll of Hubbard
& Earll, Chico. These, with George A.
Legg of Legg & Shaw, Nevada City, and
G. A. Guttman of Hockhelmer & Co..
Germantown, constitute the executive
committee.
To-day's session was devoted to a con
ference with the manufacturers and job
bers of San Francisco, Sacramento and
Marysville, and many matters of mutual
interest were introduced and thoroughly
discussed and considered. Various re
quests were made of tho manufacturers
and jobbers' with reference to receiving
prompt Information as to changes in price
and other matters of detail, the reason
ableness and justice of which were im
mediately recognized and cheerfully ac
quiesced in.
By request of the retail association the
matter of the suit now pending before
" the Interstate Commerce Commission was
then brought up for consideration" and
fully discussed. Much satisfaction was
expressed by the members of the associ
ation at the opportunity afforded them
of hearing the merits of this case ex
plained from the standpoint of the coast
Jobbers and manufacturers, and many
material questions were asked and dis
cussion indulged in by the members, gen
erally developing the fact that they had
evidently given much thought to the
question of the advisability of reducing
the existing differentials between carload
and less than carload shipments, which is
the principal contention between the Job
bers of the coast and those of St.
Louis and Chicago. The following reso
lution was unanimously adopted:
Whereas, We recognize that the Interests of
the producing, manufacturing and commercial
communities, both wholesale and retail, of the
Pacific Coast are bo lndissolubly bound to
gether and dependent upon one another that
any condition which works a hardship upon
one of these interests must necessarily, either
directly or Indirectly, bring hardship upon the
others; therefore, be It
Resolved, That we, the Pacific Retail Hard
ware Association, In convention assembled, do
hereby express our satisfaction with the pres
ent existing transcontinental railway tarlfl
principles and conditions Into this State and
desire to place on record our satisfaction with
the differentials and schedules that have been
In effect Blnce June, 1888, and that this asso
ciation will do Its best to uphold these dif
ferentials and trust the efforts of the manu
facturers and wholesale merchants of the coast
will be successful In maintaining them.
The meeting was attended by a large
number of the manufacturers and Jobbers
of San Francisco and Sacramento.
A banquet was given at the Park Hotel
In the- evening by the Chlco members of
the retail association, attended by the
entire membership of that organization,
the Jobbers and manufacturers and somo
of the representative citizens of Chlco.
The utmost good feeling prevailed and
the guests left unanimous in their praise
of the hospitality tendered by the people

XIV. DANIEL WEBSTER.
"No man can be as great as he looks,"
was the comment made upon Webster by
an Englishman who met him for the first j
time. The remark was a prophecy as |
well as a characterization, for great as j
was . Daniel Webster, he did not fill up j
the measure of his own capacities.
Born in 1752. in the backwoods of New i
Hampshire, throughout his life Webster
had the advantage of associating with
men of power. Like Salmon P. Chaso
and Thaddeus Stevens, who also were
brought up In the New England hill
country, he found an intellectual stimulus j
In the country folk and in the little col- i
lege which he attended. From childhood up j
people loved him, admired him and fa- j
vored him; he easily got into one of the j
best law offices in Boston and had the j
friendship and professional rivalry of the
great Jeremiah Mason of New Hamp
shire. Thenceforth he associated freely
with the most intellectual and hlghly
trained men of his epoch, and throughout
most of his life he combined laborious
public duties with a lucrative private
practice of the law.
The first period of Webster's public
service brought out at once his skill as a
parliamentarian and his ability as a
pleader. From 1813 to ISI7 he was a
member of the House of Representatives
at Washington and distinguished himself
by his unyielding opposition to Madison's
administration and to the war of 1812; he
was one of the Federalists who refused to
vote men or money for what they be
lieved to be an unjust war. In 191S, when
only 26 years old, he made his most fa
mous argument before the Supreme Court
âthat on the celebrated Dartmouth Col
lege case. The principle which he argued
and which the court sustained was that a
State could not revoke the charter of a
corporation, if once granted without re
striction; and he thus had a great part
in establishing a most important pillar of
our present system of constitutional law.
Webster re-entered Congress In 1523, and
during .the remaining thirty years of his
life he was never out of the public serv
ice for more than a few months; and he
came forward as the greatest orator in
a period of eloquence and as the cham
pion of the principle of nationality. Ma
jestic in presence, with a countenance
bold and commanding, a voice which vi
brated like the peals of diminishing thun
der, perfectly self-possessed, his words
springing together with power and sweet
ness, no wonder that thousands crowded
together to hear him epeak. Web
ster began his career as an orator In a
time when the tradition of the eloquence
of the revolution was still strong, when
many living men had been swept off their
feet by a torrent of Patrick Henry's dis
connected rhetoric; yet Webster was al
ways a natural and conversational
speaker, never depending for his effects
upon a climax of striking words thrown
together into an Impassioned appeal; dis
trusting effects of voice and gesture, but
irresistible in the appeal of his tremen
dous nature to lesser minds. He was an
orator of the modern school, which re
quires easy, persuasive, almost conversa
tional manner, but he reinforced his ease
with a power and intensity which carried
all before It.
The greatest test of Webster's genius as
an orator was his parliamentary duel with
Hayne of South Carolina, in IS3O. Every
schoolboy knows how upon an innocent
little resolution as to the public lands
there arose the most Interesting constitu
tional debate in American history, and.
how Webster. In January, IS3O prefaced
his speech with his famous simile: "When
a mariner has been tossed for many days
in thick weather and on an unknown aea
he naturally avails himself of the fir?t
pause In the storm, the earliest glance of
the sun, to take his latitude and ascertain
how far the elements have driven him
from his true course." In reality, Hayne
was only a sort of stalking horse; the man
whom Webster was attacking sat as pre
siding officer of the Senate; It was John
C. Calhoun, Vice President of the United
States. The speech was in reality a reply
to Calhoun's doctrine of nullification,
which that wily statesman had a few
months before set forth In what was
called the "South Carolina exposition."
What Webster sought was an opportu
nity to meet and to refute the doctrine
that the Union and the exercise of na
tional powers were subject to tne will of
individual States. Webster wa3 not the
only man to see that the Union was what
was t.fterward called an "indestructible
union of imperishable States"; his service
was, by the power of his splendid ora
tory, his clear-cut thought, his high pa
triotism, to express the national feeling
which was conscious of Itself, yet unable
to give a reason for its being.
"\Â» c are affected by such statements
much as was the gentleman who went to
hear "Hamlet" for the first time, and
thought it was "too full of quotatioi.s. '
Webster's doctrine Is the everyday doc
trine now, but in 1830 It was denied by
Calhoun and by a large school of South
ern and even Northern statesmen; and
Webster put It into a form where school
children can learn it by heart and yet
where the most renowned constitutional
lawyers are glad to borrow his argument.
Webster did not save the Union, but he
taught the Irresistible argument for union
which has been repeated until it is ac
cepted by all parties and by all sections.
' | Three years later Calhoun was free tc
I express his own mind, and he entered the
i lists against the Massachusetts Senator
. In defense of the same doctrine of nulli
, fication. and again Webster pointed out
with all the force of his marvelous logic
the abyss Into which nullification would
* plunge the country. "Sir. those who es
pouse the doctrine of nullification reject,
t as it seems to me, the first great principle
r of all republican legislationâ that is. that
, the majority must govern."
Shortly after these two debates partiÂ«>Â«
' where reconstituted, and Webster, by his
c natural preference, found himself a mem
t ber of the Whig organization, to whirr
> he adhered, with some intervals of inde
â¢ dependency, throughout his life. Ir
IS4O Harrison was elected the first Whig
President, and his choice for Secretary of
State fell upon Webster. His principal
service to the President was to revise the
inaugural atluress and to cut out the old
fashiontd classical allusions.
By this time the question of slavery,
and especially of the extension of slave
territory, had come to be the most im
portant controversy beforo the public, and
during the years from 1542 to ISJ|> Webster
was compelled to take ground. It was hi 3
natural instinct to di.sliKe slavery; he had
protested against the opening up of tho
Missouri Territory to slavery in 1S1D; he
had anathematized the New Englandera
who still found a profit in the illicit slave
trade; he had early declared. "I regard
domestic slavery as one of the greatest
evils, both moral and political;" he op
.posed the annexation of Texas, and de-
Vrecated tho Mexican war. On the other
hand, he never had any sympathy with
the abolitionists, or even with ardent ami
persistent anti-slavery men like John
Quincy Adams, and when the question
came to a head in the campaign of ISIS
he faltered, and a few month 9 later raado
his best-known, tho\igh not his best,
speech.
There are but two days in American his
tory which tell their own story without
explanationâ the Fourth of July and the
7th of Marchâ and the latter of these two
days marks Webster's deliberate and final
speech upon slavery. Senator Chase
wrote to his friend Sumner on that very
day: "Va! Va! Masachusetts has spoken,
and such a speech! Nothing proposedâ
nothing apparently though! of but abso
lute and unconditional surrender. Will
not Faneuil Hall thunder once more?"
There was some reason in the violent
feeling of the anti-slavery people toward
Webster, for they had hoped that, with
out adopting their principle of eternal
war upon slavery, he might take tha
ground that the time had come at last to
limit the hated Institution within tho
boundaries of the then slave-holding
States. It was not enough for him to de
clare! "I would not take pains uselessly
to reaffirm an ordinance of nature nor to
re-enact a law of God." Chaso asked,
pertinently: "What else should lawmak
ers do than to reaffirm the ordinances of
God?" Many extreme abolitionists in
sisted that Webster wa3 bidding for
Southern votes in the convention of ISSC.
'itae charge is unnecessary. Webster
sincerely loved the Union, and nowhere
in his writings is there a more noble
apostrophe to the Union, a more stren
uous arraignment of secession, than in
this very speech. The real difficulty
which affected his whole character and
life was a lack of comprehension of the
moral issue, a lack oi understanding of
the danger to the Union from the contin
uance of slavery. He was not one of those
who lay awake nights in indignation at
the arrogance of the slave power, or the
national humiliation of slavery. The tor
rent of denunciation he met with the story
of tJÂ»e old farmer who refused to clear the
paths because "he did not mean to clear
off the snow until it stopped snowing."
Webster could not understand that the
snow of criticism would never cease fall
ing until it had become a glacier which
should grind to powder the apparently
indestructible rock cf slavery.
Webster was, with ail nis mcuviauai
power, a man extremely susceptible to
influence; throughout his life he had been
accustomed to receive from time to time
the financial aid of the rich New Eng
land Whig?, and there is a story of a
Boston gentleman who was visited by one
of the too frequent canvassers tor a fund
to pay off Daniel Webster's debts. He
generously subscribed $1000. and when in
due time he was reminded of his pledsa
he turned in a note of hand for JWuo.
signed by the great man. The collector
Insisted that he could not pay Daniel
Webster's debts with Daniel \\ ebster s
notes and the subscriber was compelled
to relinquish a second $1000 in clear cash.
The truth is that Webster occupied the
position of a public man whose ultimata
support was the subscriptions of fellow
countrymen, and it was inevitable that
his own comfort and peace of mind should
seem to him of large importance; on the.
other hand, he could not help being insen
sibly affected by what he knew to be tha
opposition of his warm friends, the "Cot
ton Whigs" of New England. They de
sired a compromise and thought the con
cession that slavery might go into new
territory a small affair in comparison with
harmony between the sections. Webster
reflected the views of these honest and
patriotic but mistaken men; had he been,
at this time a sun siiinlng by hi 3 own
light instead of a cold, reflective moon,
how much more splendid would be tia
reputation! He persuaded himself that it
was in his power to save the Union by in
ducing his friends to vote for the compro
mise, and having reached that conclusion
he was doubtless pleased to ste that sav
ing the Union was a good road to tho
Presidency. His attitude was not so much
wrong as feeble; where was the Web
Â¦Ster who had confronted the whole might
of nullification oratory? Where was the
Webster who had bearded the great An
drew Jackson? Where was the Webster
who had defied his own party and asked
them a3 the most serious question -of
their lives. "Where am I to go?" Whera
was the Webster who had combated tho
annexation of Texas? Had he possessed
the convictior.3 of John Quincy Adams,
or even the shrewd farsight of William
H Sewarti, he would have placed him
self at the head of the opposition to the
ext nsion of slavery; he would have be
gun the work Abraham Lincoln was t->
take up. and he would have gone down to
posterity as a hero who dared anything
for his principles.
Yet nothing can take away from Web
ster the palm of a greatness all his own.
for he was advocate, statesman, diplo
matist and orator all in one. Ho wanted
to be President, surely a worthy ambition;
he rendered an Inestimable service to h!a
country in his steadfast advocacy of na
tionality. His fault was that his vision
became" obscured. Had he possessed the
firmness of Washington or the devotion
to principle of Abraham Lincoln he might
have stood next to them in the Valhalla
of American statesmen. And if we must
rank him lower than Jefferson, lower than
Hamilton, lower than Marshall, yet hi*
spirit might sny of himself, as Dar.te
said when he found himself amid the gal
axy of ancient popts. "And I iraa sixth
in "all that misht of mind."

of "Frank S. Johnson in the East would
seem to have borne some fruit. It is a
fact that Mr. Johnson has bought a can
nery since his return to this city. This
he admitted yesterday, but refused to say
which carinery it was that had come un
der his management.
N "I have four brand? of fruit under my
control," he said, "but I do not think it
best to say what they are. Neither will
I say which cannery I have, for the mat
ter is confidential for the time being. I
know that there is a great curiosity about
the matter on the street, but those who
are curious will have to wait for a little."
That there is curiosity on the street is
true. One story was that the Code-Port
wood 'cannery was the one in question,
but this was denied absolutely at the office
of that concern. Mr. Johnson was re
oorted to have made an offer for the prop
erty also an offer for the plant of the
Pacific Fruit Packing Company, which is
on Stockton street. At the offices of the
combined canneries no information was
obtained. All along California street "the
idea was entertained that a deal of con
siderable size was in progress, but all the
canners denied that they knew anything
a On top of the other rumors came the
seemingly well authenticated story that
Fastern capitalists had sent forward an
agent to see what could be done to estab
lish a can manufacturing plant here. This
created even more interest than the
stories about the deal in canneries. One
reason was that the present can manufac
turing plants in this vicinity are supposed
to be giving an advantage to the score of
canning companies commonly known as
"the combine." Another can manufac
turing plant would Indicate still further a
struggle in the local field and also a be
lief that the field was rich. Ther6 is no
doubt that the can plant i 8 talked of and
under consideration and may soon be a
reality Two or three canners, hearing of
the talk about a new can manufactory,
said, "That is just what we want."
The difficulty in picking out the can
nery which has been bought by Mr. John
son was made considerable by the number
that are not combined. In the array 'are
the California Canneries Company, lim
ited which is now engaged in an enlarge
ment of its plant and an extension of its
business: the Code- Portwood cannery, the
Golden Gate of San Jose, I- lickinger s of
San Jose, the Overland. Corvell and Pa
cific of this city, Pyle"s of San Jose, Hunt
Brothers of Haywards, Miller & hoskiss
at Healdsburg, the Los Gatos Canning
Company and the canneries at Anaheim
and "Whittler in Southern California, and
also a small cannery at Emeryville.
collections the Auditor will apply thÂ©
moneys so received to the payment of the
remainder of the salaries for November
and also those for December, amounting
to $00,000. In this way the existing dif
ferences between teachers and merchants
will be amicably settled and they will re
ceive their Just dues.
The S.VXM) paid to the merchants will, it
is understood, be added to the $27,000 now
held in trust by the Union Trust Com
pany under an agreement entered into
between the merchants and teachers when
the litigation was first commenced, and
be apportioned under the terms of that
agreement.
Benefit to Ban Hanlon.
The testimonial benefit given last night
to Daniel Edward Hanlon by hi 3 many
friends was a big 1 success. Golden Gate
Hall was well filled. The performance
consisted of a sketch. "The Silent Sys
tem," in which William Ogilvie and May
Sullvan appeared, and there were many
specialties. Mr. Hanlon concluded the
performance with a recital of several
dramatic selections. Kelly and Stone, the

7CHICAGO, Jan. 18.â The scanty array of
news to-day served its dally purpose of em
phasizing the fact that the supply of wheat
Is away over the present demand. The ses
sion was dull with put and call transactions
eliminated, as per the Board of Trade e"dlct
of yesterda;, with a steady stream of wheat
going out weakened prices save toward the
close. At the opening with Liverpool lower,
crop reports favorable and the Argentine with
an alleged exportable surplus of 72.000.000
bushels. May at 65Vj^C3%c showed a loss over
night of UifSic. A little buying early ad
vanced the market to 65%ig659ic. From that
the price generally sank with occasional fits
of steadiness to 6474 c for May. Near the end
of the session a private cablegram brought
confirmation of the report of damage to the
French crop by frost. Shorts covered and
there was some good buying on the report,
which Influenced an advance of May to Softc,
at which It closed, rather easy In tone.
The corn market had Its usual supply of
supporting news at command, wet weather,
small offerings and steady cable*-but the In
fluence of a weak wheat market was Just
strong enough to hold the price down. May
closed steady, He under yesterday.
The oats market was sluggish. May closing
%c depressed.
Th" significant feature of the provision mar
ket was the dullness of trade. The volume of
business was much smaller than it has been
recently and holders were disturbed by the
fact. May pork closed 10@12%c under yester
day; May lard 6c lower and May ribs 2V4@sc

NEW YORK. Jan. IS.â The 6tock market
conditions showed no marked change from
those prevailing for some time pact and gen
eral las-situde was the < haracteristic. One or
two railroad Â»tocks reflected a fair demand,
notably th* Norfolk and Western issues and
Union Pacific*. The Baltimore and Ohio stacks
were also bought in moderate volume. Yes
terday's movement in Leather, from which
speculators hoped ' the market would receive
â¢n impulse, dwindled av.ny and profit-taking
dpprew-ed the price. Sugar was advanced In
a desultory manner durinr the early part of
the day. but in the afternoon broke over five
jvjint* from the top level and unsettled the
whole rnarktt. Covering by the bear* in Sugar
end the late demand for Union Pacific stiffened
the market again and served to retrieve a part
of the <5Â«-rllnÂ«'S. making the close firm and the
net changes mixed. There was a very marked
absorption of new ar.d reorganization bonds.
which hervf-d as a background to the strength
of the whole market for Bt-curities. The un
dertone was unmistakably firm and in npite of
the very lifiht demand there was no pressure
to m? 11 ntorks. The further reduction in the
Bank of Knrland'F private rate of discount
and the weekly return of the bank served to
confirm confidence In the money outlook. The
rtrength In London on thl* score and on the
hopes ensender^d by the meaner news from
{south Africa causes some reflected rtrength
In th* New York Htock market. Surpluses
continue to accumulate in New York both "by
reason of the influx of money from the in
terior and the <iÂ«-t>osit of Internal revenue col
lections with the banks and extraordinary gov
erntr^nt disbursements Jty the sub-treasury on

for money on call continuing very light funds

4hi per cent on ell railroad stock collateral.
Extraordinary loans are even reported at 4
per cent and mercantile paper of a high grade
ie coming into additional demand at !, per
cent. To-day's strong undertone in stocks was
emphasized by the good reports received dur
ing the day Â«>f railroad earnings for the sec
ond week in January. The hardening tendency
of sterling exchange is viewed with tranquillity
because the Bank of England haÂ« withdrawn
It* concessions on gold exports, thus raising
the gold export point for exchange consider
ably above that at which gt>ld has recently

London Markets.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The news that General Buller had crossed the
Tugela River in force caused a confident open
ing at the Stock Exchange here to-day, but
the failure of the public to respond to the
encouraging tidings caused prices to stick after
midday. The action of the Bank of England
directors in reducing the minimum discount
rate from 7 to 4V4 per cent hoisted consols,
but In some quarters It was looked upon as
paving the way for a fresh Government loan.
Americans opened at, an advance, but there
was no buying and prices sagged on New York
supplies of stock. The Argentine Republic took
gold to the amount of Â£10.000.
The strength of the Bank of England's week
ly returns is due to the seasonable inflow of
money from the provinces. Money and bills
vere again weak. Discount houses have re
duced deposit rates ',i to 2Â»4 per cent, calls
to 2% per cent with notices.
Foreign exchange rates to-day were: Paris,
25.20; Berlin, 20.49%. Silver wa* firm at a
lower level.

CHITTENDEN SENDS
HIS BEST WISHES
OAKLAND. Jan. IS.â Henry A.
Chittenden. who first presenter!
the needs of Oakland to Mr. Car

$50,000 gift. Is at present in Yuma.
Ariz., where he has gone for his
health. He is a newspaper man. and
for years was with the New York
Herald and was editor of the Mil
waukee Times. Some years ago he
took up his residence in Oakland. an*l
It was with a determination of doing
something for his new home that he
made the move that secured the libr.i
ry to Oakland. From Yuma Mr. Chit
tenden has sent the following:
"YUM A. Ariz.. Jan. I?.â Alameda

remainder of the city. It has moved Oak
land to new acts and to a hearty support
of the bonding proposition, that means co
much.
There were two unselfish acts In con
nection with this gift of Andrew Carnegie
to Oakland. One was the effort made by
Henry A. Chittenden to secure the Rift
from Mr. Carnegie, and the other was the
effort of the lcdies of the Ebell Society
to furnish a site for the proposed build
ing.
Mr. Chittenden came to Oakland a fc-v
years ago and was impressed with the
necessity of a new library. Knowing An
drew Carnegie had endowed some public
libraries and having an acquaintance with
the great steel magnate, he, as a plain
citizen of Oakland, laid these necessities
before Mr. Carnegie. As a result Mr.
Carnegie offered Oakland $50,000 for a li
brary if the site would be furnished for
the building. Then the ladles of the Ebell
Society took up their work. After the
men of Oakland had failed the woman's
club went to work and raised $20,000. pur
chased the site and presented it to the
city of Oakland. Mr, Carnegie was noti
fied, nnd to-day his answer was receivt-d
Instructing the city of Oakland to draw
upon li!s 1 rankers for the money promised
Mr. Chittenden. And co Oakland's new
era has dawned] and it remains for t'.ie
city to bring the full noontide of pros
perity ar<l improvement.
The Information Mating that the gift
fund from Mr. CRrnejrle was available
wns received by President Hnyt of the
lir.'inl of Library Trustees to-day.
President Hoyt says plans for tho li
brary will be asked for at once and build
ing will be commenced as snnn as possi
ble. No delay will be permitted and every
eiTort will be made to have the work fully
under way by spring.
Councilman Felton Taylor commenced
the necessary legislation at the last meet
ing of the Council, when he introduced
the following ordinance:
An ordinance authorizing the use of cer
tain land for the purpose of erecting and
malntalnlnK thereon a building or buildings
for the Oakland Free Public Library and
Reading Rooms, and also authorizing and
directing the Hoard of Library Trustees to
equip and maintain thereon such buildinÃs
as may be necessary for such library and
readlnsr rocms. the cost thereof to bÂ« pay
able from the library funds.
The structure Is to be located upon the
land presented to the city by the Ebell
Society, at the southwest corner of Grove
and Fourteenth streets.
The proposed ordinance was referred to
the Ordinance and Judiciary Committee.
That branch of the Council will take fa
vorable action upon the measure as soon
as it meets. It will then go before the
municipal legislative body and will I
receive unanimous indorsement. The
matter will then go before the Board of
Library Trustees, which will secure the
necessary plans and proceed with the
work.

sixteenth birthday, and the" groom, aped
Â£3 years, was a painter. When Wigg
pressed his suit for the heart and hand
of the girl her mother interposed objec

Mrs. Wcnsley emphatically refused to
jrive her consent to the union. The girl's
lather. however. manifested a more
lenient disposition, and banking their
hopes on this the young lovers eloped and
â¢were married.
The season of their matrimonial biles
Â¦was of short duration, for attt-r a fÂ« w
lirlef months the husband began acquir
ing the habit of staying out late of r.ishts.
An investigation showed that he found
more pleasure shuffling cards at a green
covered table than in the comforts of Ms
newly made home and status. Soon pro
visions at the Wigg household became so
scarce that the child-wife was compelled
to knock at the parental door, seek fqr
piveness at the hands of her mother, who
had frowned upon her match, and ask for
Finally in October IS?S. the erring all
nighter absolutely deserted his young
Vride. He informed her that he propose!

child-bride filed suit to have dissolved the
bonds that had been so hastily entered
into. The plaintiff was granted permis
sion to resume her maiden name.

day by Marie Stewart against George D.
Fiewart. The complaint, prepared by At
torney D. Mitchell, alleges desertion.

FRUIT GROWERS
MAY DO THEIR
OWN SHIPPING
Object to the Rail
road's Rates.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. IS.
The fruit growers of Eden Township
have combined to fight the exorbitant
frHght rates imposed by the Southern
Pacific on their products shipped over that
road. They will charter a steamer,
which will make daily trips from Roberts
Landing in West San Lorenzo to San
Francisco.
Not only do the fruit growers of that
district, which comprises Hay wards, San
Lorenzo and San Iveandro, complain of
the excessive freight rates, but of the
slowness of the transportation also. They
assert that it takes twelve hours to ship
a box of fruit from San Lorenzo to San
Francisco, and it is nearly Impossible to
get perishable vegetables to market be
lorc they are withered.
Nearly all of the loading ranchers of
Kdr>n Township have signified their will
ingness to enter into the scheme. It has
not yrt I e?n determined what vessel will
be secured for the purpose of opposing the
Southern Pacific, but it is probable' that
the steamer San Lorenzo will be char
tered. /

OAKLAND. Jan. IS.â Andrew Carr.e
gie to-day Instructed the city of
Oakland to draw upon him for $5*,
000 for the new free library build
ing, to be located upon the site purchased
for the city by the ladies of the Ebell So
ciety. With this act the future of Oak
land'! dream, a new library building. !s
assured. Nothing is now left but to be
gin the work of preparing plans and ccn
structir.g the building. This will be done
at once.
With this gift from a non-resident of
the city a new era seems to have dawn?d
upon Oakland. From the very moment,
six months ago. when Henry A. Chltten
den. an Oakland newspaper man. secured
this gift from Mr. Carnegie. Oakland tooK
on a new life. Following Immediately
upon this gift was secured a public build
ing and a tlte for the city, wth J300.000
to be Invested by the Federal Government
In this work. Then came the awakening
over the bonding proposition, with a new
City Hall, parks, boulevards and better
streets and sewers in the Immediate fu
ture.
The gift of so large a sum from a man
who has never been within the borders
seems to have acted as a stimulus to the

night with the members and friends of
the San Francisco Commercial Travelers'
Association, on the occasion of its an

fafr was strictly Invitational.
The dancing of two little missesâ
Queenie Tilton and Gladys Montague
was the prettiest feature of the pro
gramme. F. J. Byrne, Fred Grifflng
Frank Weston. T. W. Hlckey and Messrs
La faille. Hrackett and|Rhodes were each
warmly applauded for their efforts. The
success of the gathering was largely due

OAKLAND. Jan. 18.-Mrs. B. Fay Mills
purprlsed the Oakland Club yesterday
during a discussion upon the "New
Woman."
"The grÂ«Â»at reforms of the present day
will not lÂ»e effected by the suffragists of
to-day," paid Mrs. Mills, "but by the
woman who Is true to her home life and
to her home duties. The greatest good
will come from the. home. The woman in
the home is the most powerful factor in
the development of the times."

LOWELL E. HARDY
WEDS MISS MAYHEW
FENCING OFF
A SECTION OF
LAKE MERRITT
Cutting Drives Piles
Around a Claim.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 18.
Another move was made on Lake
Merritt to-day, when Francis Cutting,
who owns the property at 14^4 Harrison
street, backing upon Lake Merritt, began
driving piles into the lake, fencing off a
considerable portion of the water surface.
The property thus fenced off is triangular
in shape and is claimed by Mr. Cutting.
The fencing is being done because Mr.
Cutting fears that the city Is about to
make some move to clear its title to the
Lake Merritt lands and he wishes to bo
in technical possession of the section of
the lake frontage claimed by him. This
driving of .piles into the lake was noticed
by Street Superintendent M. K. Miller,
who at once reported the fact to the
Board of Public Works as follows:
"I beg leave to report that piles are
being driven in Lake Merritt (presumably
by Mr. Cuttincr) on lhe south line of
Twentieth street, from the shore easterly,
with the evident intention of fencing in a
piece of land not covered by the waters
of the lake."
This is now a piece of land above water,
but It is in that section to which Coun
cilman Taylor referred when he made his
original move against those who have
jumped the lake frontage. Mr. Cutting
claims his piece by right of title, and Is
not jumping the, frontage. He is pro
tecting what he considers his interests.
There are no maps of this section to show
whether he is infringing upon city prop
erty. .
Market street, and M. Slminoff, 1223 Mar
ket street. Simlnoff declared last night
that all his force was working.
About 100 men were present, and then*
was much argument on the rights of labor
and the measures necessary to secure best
results. M. Scrift occupied the chair and
J. Boyarsky acted as secretary. Ad
dresses were made by Ed Rosenberg, sec
retary of the San Francisco Council of
Labor; Arthur R. Andre, organizer of the
same; Walter Macarthur, and others.
After a long discussion it was resolved to
instruct the delegates of the union to meet
the executive council of the Trades
Unions, which convenes to-night, state
the case of the cloakmakers to that body
and reach some method of procedure by
joint action.
MARRIED ONE YEAR.
Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Plunkett Cele
brate Their Wedding Anni
versary.
An elaborate dinner was given last night
at a downtown rotisserle by Mr. and Mrs.
William John Plunkett in honor of the
first anniversary of their wedding. The
banquet hall and table had been beauti
fully decorated for the occasion with a
profusion of flowers and evergreens, anil
the many floral tributes of which the host
and hostess were the recipients wore
strewn about the room in picturesque
profusion.
A splendid menu, complete in every de
tail, was discussed for several hours, dur
ing which a string orchestra rendered
some delightful musical selections. At
the conclusion of tho dinner Judge J. F.
Barry, who acted as tcastmaster, made
a felicitous speech, in which he wisiied
all sorts of prosperity for Mr. and Mrs.
Plunkett on behalf of the assemble J
guests. Mr. Plunkett responded appro
priately, and there followed an im
promptu programme of Instrumental ami
vocal selections, which added greatly to
the enjoyment of the affair. Among those
who contributed interesting numbers were
Mrs. Plunkett. John Woostcr, Mrs. Midh,
Mrs. A. E. Chipperflcld and Misa L. A.
Ferry. Toasts were also responded to by
Dr. L. R. Rlgdon. John C Spinney and K.
H. Hart. Following is the list of guests,
most of whom were present at the mar
riage of Mr. and Mrs. Plunkett one year
ago:
Mr. and Mrs. John B. Wooster, John
Wooster, Misa Luella Munson, Mrs. Lu
cia Douglass, E. H. Hart, Mr. and Mrs.
Mish. Dr. L. R. Rigdon and wife. Mr.
and Mrs. Alfred E. Chlpperfleld, Mr. and
Mrs. John C. Spinney. Miss L. A. Ferry,
Mrs. E. Dotie, Mrs. N. Loupy, Miss A.
Loupy, Miss Rose Debonair and Juige
Barry.
be raised in the building we are about
to erect.
"If the ladies of the Ebell Society will
lend their features, the men of Oakland
will put their profiles in an ornamental
frieze, that their civic energy may never
be forgotten.
"Let us hope that this donation will
act as a spur to greater civic sacrifice
on the part of our own citizens. This is
a time to make history for Oakland.
Parks, drives, wharves, docks, sewers,
school houses, all necessary â all to be had
for little sacrifice, and that only tem
porary.
"Thanks, Mr. Carnegie; thanks for your
generous gift, but we are not passing the
bat any more. You have been more than
generous. You have done more than do
nate a library. You have caused us to
resolve and pledge one another as citi
zens of Oakland to help ourselves."
CITY COUNCILMEN
LOOKING FORWARD
OAKLAND. Jan. IS.â The invitation
from Andrew Carnegie that Oakland
mipht draw on him for its new library is
looked upon by the City Councilmen as
the herald of the dawn of a new era for
the city. Their opinions follow:
COUNCILMAN F. R. CxIRARDâ A
stranger has given $50,000 for a library
building, thanks to Mr. Chittenden. The
ladles of the Ebell Society have furnished
a site on which to erect the structure.
NEW INDUSTRY FOR
SIGHTLESS WOMEN
OAKLAND. Jan. 18.â The management
of the Home for the Adult Blind haa
started a new Industry at that institu
tion. It 13 that of reseating cane chaira.
and the work is performed by the female
inmates of the place. The price charged
ranees from 50 cents up to 11. which in
cludes recaning and varnishing. All or
ders sent to the home will be promptly
looked after, and it is hoped that the
patronage will bo liberal. Half of th?
money goes to the State and the balance
is given to the operatives.
Claims aggregating SISOO have been ap
proved by the Mate Board of Examiners
for labor performed by inmates of the
home. This will come out of the special
appropriation made for that purpose.
We have also been given a new postoffice
by the National Government, and we
surely ought to be able to get a new City
Hall by means of taxation. The new
career of Oakland has commenced, I
think, and the efforts of the fossils to pre
vent advancement will no longer prevail.
The bond issue for public improvements
will certainly pass, and the Xwentieth
century will see us leaving the rear and
forging to the front.
COUNCILMAN B. C. CUVELLIERâ
The new century will commence with the
new epoch in Oakland's history. We are
now bound to go ahead, and I think that
the building of the new library will be
quickly followed by the erection of a new
City Hall, new schooihouses, new fire
engine houses, new pavements, new sew
ers and harbor improvements that will
enable deep water vessels to come tn
here. When all this is done Oakland will
be one of the foremost cities of the
country.
COUNCILMAN ANSON BARSTOW-
The ladies of the Ebell Society should be
congratulated and Mr. Henry A_ Chitten
den should be thanked. To them Is due
the fact that Oakland is soon to have a
magnificent new public library. Other
public improvements will soon follow, I
feel confident, and it will not be long be
fore the city is placed upon a ievel com
mensurate with Its size and importance.
The order for a forward march movement
was given when Andrew Carnegie agreed
to give the city of Oakland $50,000 for a
new public library. We have abrogated
the standstill policy which has so long
prevailed and will now make up for lost
time in going ahead.
OAKLAND SHOULD
HELP ITSELF NOW
OAKLAND. Jan. 18.â Mayor Snow was
informed of the receipt of Mr. Carnegie's
letter soon after it had been opened.
"If the president of the Board of Li
brary Trustees," he said, "has received
Mr. Carnegie's donation of $50,000, well
and good, but I am not hurrahing about
it nor advocating that this is the best
way for Oakland to progress. If Mr. Car
negie had been a citizen It would have
put a different face upon the matter, but
he is not, and I feel like a beggar. How
ever. Mr. Carnegie is entitled to the more
credit for his broad philanthropy and
generous gift. And to Citizen Chittenden.
who would have given a library outright
if he had been financially ableâ who did
the next thing possible and secured the
donation for usâ to him a tablet Hhould

STENOGRAPHIC FAMINE.
Police Judges "Want an End Put to'
Present State of Affairs.
The Police Judges met yesterday at
noon and Judge Fritz was appointed Pre
siding Judge for this year.
The writ of mandate secured by Attor
ney Pistoles! in regard to the issuance of
a warrant for the arrest of Captain Witt
man and two policemen on a charge of
battery was discussed. The Judges do
cided that they had. a right to exercise
their discretion in such a matter, and as
the issuance of a warrant was a judicial
act the writ of mandate did not apply
The Judges will meeet again to-day to
take some action as to the stenographic
famine. There are only two stenograph
ers, and on several occasions witnesses in
felony cases have been sent away at con
siderable inconvenience, as both sten
ographers were engaged and the cases
could not be taken up. It is no unusual
thing to see two policemen rushing along
with one of the stenographers from one
court to another, and just as he has com
menced taking down the testimony there
is a demand for his services in another
court.
COLONEL WEINSTOCK
DISCUSSES SOCIALISM
Colonel H. Weinstock enlightened a
large audience last evening in the Acad
emy of Sciences Hall on the aims and ob
jects of socialism. He delivered a con
cise and interesting address on the sub
ject and his views in the matter were
warmly applauded by the members of the
Socialist Labor party, under whose aus
pices the lecture was given.
At the outset he explained the differ
ence between anarchism, communism,
nationalism and socialism. He told of the
objects of each and then called off a list
of the distinguished men and women of
the world who were deeply Interested in
socialism. He mentioned Grant Allen, the
author; George Bernard Shaw, the fa
mous critic; Mrs. Theodore Wright, a
leading English actress, and many other
famous persons who were believers in
socialism. He told of the efforts of the
members #of the organization to secure
the government ownership of railroad,
telegraph and other important branches
now in the hands of trusts and big cor
porations. Throughout his lecture he was
accorded the greatest attention and at
the conclusion was roundly applauded.

Herman Mitchell, Kid Selms, Jerry Lenehan, J.

Yates, L. Ellinger, J. Conlon and Ed Mc-
Closky. Willie Schoenbein mascotted for both Bides
impartially. The "Market streets" had the advantage of
weight and age, but their younger and lighter opponents
possessed more vim and perhaps more muscle. Anyway,
the "Market streets" found themselves being drawn slow
ly but surely across the line, when Dutchy Mitchell whip
ped out his bolo and severed the rope, saving his team
from the disgrace of , defeat. Pandemonium wasn't a
marker to the racket that ensued, but "Captain" Feigh
erey finally declared that his team was entitled to the
prizeâ fifteen meals in"de Beanery"â because they would
have won anyway but for the fdul. The "Market streets"
accepted the dictum of the "boss." but not without pro
testing that a score of "kids was oullin' de rope behind
de- 'Kearny streets' " when Mitcht.l cut the difference
with his knife. \
This trouble settled, time was called and the entire
gang herded near the grand stand for a midday lunch
of beer and sandwiches. "Chaw" Hanley stood guard over
the keg of beer, that had been donated by a friendly li
quor dealer, and saw that no applicant was served twice.
He was accused of sampling the contents of the keg oft
ener than was necessary, but declared, with a look of in
jured Innocence, that he had only tasted the beverage
once or twice to make sure there was no "dope" in It.
After luncheon a championship game of baseball was
played between the "Baltimore Hops" and the "Oriental
Bmokers," the former being recruited from the Market
street gang and the latter from the Kearny street out
fit, as follows: â¢ Â»
"Baltimore Hops"â J. Jelllck, E. Ordway, J. Lenehan,
H. Gavlca. C. Hawkins, George McClosky, L. Yates, M.
Cohen and L. Ellinger.
"Oriental Smokers"â G. Hill, G. Brown, J. Brady, E.
Allen, G. Schelb, George Doyce, Al Layden, Al Kidd and
"Captain" Feigherey.
C. Miller and D. Whipple acted as umpires and they
had plenty of trouble. The "Hops" were finally declared
the victors by a score of 38 to 24, but the "Smokers"
claimed half their opponents' runs were made by outsid
ers. As there were two scrub teams playing on the edge
of the diamond, it is possible such a thing might have
happened, but the referees had to give the game to some
body and the "Hops" were ahead according to the re
turns. That settled the sport for the day and the mes
senger boys scurried home to get a little sleep before re
porting on duty for the night, after the hardest day's
work they have performed for months. For the next
week the delivery of notes In San Francisco will require
double the usual time, as the boys will need fully that
much time to rest.
CONDUCTOR OF
A CAR CHOKES A
LADY PASSENGER
Trouble Over a Boy's
Fare.
HE IS THROWN OFF THE CAR
She Is Insulted and Choked by the
Conductor and Has Him Ar
rested on a Charge of
Battery.
Mrs. Annie Welsh. 120 Rlpley street,
wife of John Welsh, a clerk, secured a
warrant from Judge Cabaniss yesterday
afternoon for the arrest of "John Doe"
Burke, a conductor on the Valencia street
line, on a charge of battery.
Mrs. Welsh was riding on Burkes car
yesterday morning on her way downtown,
when a poorly dressed woman and a little
boy boarded the car. The woman tendered
Burke a nickel for her fare, which he
rang up, and then demanded a nickel for
the boy's fare. The woman said the boy
was too young, and besides she did not
have another nickel. Burke insisted upon
getting the boy's fare, and stopping the
car threw the child off. The mother
stepped off the car also, but before Burke
could ring for the car to proceed Mrs.
Welsh offered Burke a nickel for the boy's
fare.
"I don't want you to interfere," said
Burke rudely. "Keep your nickel. I know
her of old. She is no good and you are no
good."
The car went on without the woman
and boy, and Mrs. Welsh rode on to the
ferry with the intention of returning on
the car to report Burkes conduct.
At the ferry Burke said to her, "Why
don't you leave the car?" and she replied
"Because I don't want to. I am gong
back and there's my fare."
"I know what you want," said Burke
angrily. "You want to get my number
and report me, but you won't get It." He
had kept his number covered every time
he came near Mrs. Welsh. "You have to
get off this car," continued Burke, adding
language that shocked thÂ£ lady, and he
grabbed her by the throat and tried to
force her off the car. She clung with both
hands to the stanchions, and when she
screamed for help Burke released his
hold.
Mrs. Welsh paid her fare back, and
when she reached the Valencia-street
terminus she learned that the conductor
was named Burke. She lodged a com
plaint against him at the office of tho
company and threatened to have him ar
rested. She was asked not to apply for a
warrant, as the matter would be thor
oughly Investigated. Mrs. Welsh consult
ed her brother. "White Hat" McCarty
and he took her to the office of Attor
neys Eddy & HcHartin, and she told
them the circumstances. Accompanied by
Attorney McMartln, Mrs. Welsh went to
Judge Cabanlss* court and swore to the
warrant for Burkes arrest. She says she
has witnesses who will corroborate her
testimony.
Tobias Burke, the conductor, was ar
rested yesterday afternoon and taken to
the Central police station. He denied
choking Mrs. Welsh or attempting to
throw her off the car.
ESOLA CHARGES
BEFORE POLICE
COMMISSIONERS
Immaterial Evidence
Adduced.
>
MEADER FAILED TO APPEAR
The Testimony Offered Corroborated
the Charges Filed and the In
vestigation Will Be Eesumed
This Evening.
i c
Last evening the Police Commission
opened its investigation of the charges
made by the Bulletin against Lieutenant
Frederick L. Esola. Little evidence of
more than ordinary importance was ad
duced. The witnesses examined were
those offered by the Bulletin; none of the
testimony in possession of the accused
lieutenant was taken, and that which was
heard was merely corroborative of the af
fidavit filed with the commission by Fre
mont Older and signed by Alexander
Meader.
When Header's name was called he did
not answer, and testimony later given by
his wife developed the fact that shortly
after he had signed the Bulletin affidavit
he mysteriously disappeared and had not
elnce been heard of. The evidence of Mrs.
Header was shaky, to say the least. She
became entangled frequently by the Ques
tions of Attorney Frank McGowan, who
appeared for the relator. The testimony
of her brother-in-law was also dubious in
character. While both supported in the
main the allegations made in the affidavit
of Alexander Header, they were guilty of
numerous contradictions when questioned
as to minor details.
The principal witnesses of the evening
were Mr. Older and William Meloney. a
reporter of the Bulletin. It was Mr. Me
loney who ascertained the alleged facts
set forth in the charges against Esola.
He repeated conversations which he had
had with the Headers, in which they had
Bald that Lieutenant Esola, with Alexander
Header, had been guilty of stealing three
sacks of potatoes and some coffee, and
that, fearing arrest for that crime,
he had taken refuge for a
period in the McKenzie House.
Both Mr. Meloney and Mr. Older told of
having gone to the heme of Header and
there having seen the marriage certificate
of Mr. and Mrs. Header, with the name of
Frederick Harrinprton attached as one of
the witnesses. The testimony of Mrs.
Header developed the fact that the so
called Harrington was none other than
Lieutenant Esola, and that she had
known him by that name, as had her hus
band for a considerable period.
E. 11. Meloney, captain of the night
guard at San Quentin at the time Esola
was employed there, testified that upon
one occasion he had found it necessary to
reprimand Esola for appearing on duty
without his gun. Esola applied to him
gome epithet which Mr. Meloney
could not recall. That night Captain Me
loney reported Esola to the Warden, and
he was summarily dismissed the next
morning.
Ben Chambers, at that time Deputy
Warden of the prison, testified that he
had dbne air in his power to maintain
Esola in his position at that time, and
that he took that interest upon the re
quest of A. M. Lawrence, then a reporter
for the Examiner. He said that Just
prior to that time Mr. Lawrence had writ
ten numerous articles which were not to
the liking of the prison officials, and that
he hoped when he promised Lawrence to
befriend Esola that by doing such a fa
vor he would be able to ward off any fur
ther attack. As to the reasons for the
dismissal of Esola from San Quentin, Hr.
Chambers could say nothing: his memory
failed at that important point.
The investigation closed at midnight and
Â¦will be resumed this evening at S o'clock.

Some Special Features of the Boys' Picnic in Recreation Park.
MESSENGER BOYS GIVE
THEMSELVES AN OUTING
THE messenger boys of San Francisco were "It" yes
terday. They took a day off from their arduous du
ties to celebrate in their own way, untrammeled by
office rules or police Interference. In order to guard
against outsiders Intruding their unwelcome pres
ence, or a possible raid by Chief Biggy, they barred
the gates of Recreation Park, which had been hired for
the occasion, as soon as all the elect had been herded
within the inclosure and placed a 10-year-old on guard to
admit the reporters who had been favored with special
Invitations, and as usual came late. The 10-year-old did
not go to sleep on. his Job, either. "Captain" J. Felgh
erey, the "boss" of the messenger boys, was the symbol
of authority, and what he said went. It was he who ar
ranged all the contests and distributed the prizes, and It
was he who settled the question of who had won when
the duly appointed referees were In doubt.
It was 9:30 a. m. when the heavy-footed disciples of
Mercury gathered In the baseball grounds at Harrison
and Eighth streets for a field day under their own aus
pices and with only their kind for spectators. There were
about 200 present, and the wonder is that the wheels of
progress 'did not stop entirely with so many off duty.
However, with Pooh Bah Phelan holding' down the City
Hall and Mose Gunst keeping an eye on the rest of the
town the kids concluded the city would get along with
out them for a few hours. Mose was to have been there,
but missed the boat.
"Youse fellers Just wants to git onto 'yourselves, before
we starts the show a-goin'," announced "Captain" Feigh
erey as a preliminary warning Just before the sport be
gan. "Youse wants to remember dat dis ain't no riot
an' de mug dat starts trouble gits trun out, an' dat ain't
no pipe. See!"
There was no riot, but for the next four hours the
field had every appearance of being a free for all bat
tle ground. It was so In appearance only, however, for
there was not even one little scrap to mar the success
of the outing, although a war of mutilated and twisted
words raged, incessantly.
The first event was a 100-yard race for a hat, and the
winner was George Royce, who beat Jerry Lenehan, the
hitherto Invincible champion, to the wire by a nose in
11 1-16 seconds. Lenehan was greatly chagrined, but his
spirits revived when he ran away from his field in the
110-yard dash and pocketed a cash prize of J2 50. The 50
yard dash was won by Al Kidd, who thereby became en
titled to a free hair cut, shampoo and shave, all of which
his facetious friends declared he needed.
Then came the event of the day, the tug of war con
test between the "Kearny streets" and the "Market
streets." The former team was composed of the Carter
NOTABLE DEATHS
of the Day.
DEATH OF DR. WARNER.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 18.â
"Word has reached here that Dr. Amos G.
Warner, late Head of the economic depart
ment at Stanford University, died at Las
Cruces this morning. While his death was
not unexpected, the news comes as a blow
to his many friends among the faculty
and students. .
Dr. Warner's career has been a busy
and fruitful one. Graduating from the
University of Nebraska in 18S5 he pur
sued advanced work at Johns Hopkins
University, where he received the degree
of doctor of philosophy In 18S8. For the
two ensuing years he acted as general
uted. All of the property distributed was
contained in the inventory heretofore pub

Genuine Turkish and Persian Bugs.
On account of departure the entire stock of
the Turkish Rug Co. is being sold at auction
In the new building, corner Geary and Stock
ton streets. Unlike others, this sale has proved
to be a bona fide, unreserved auction. Yester
day every article put up was sold to the high
est bidder regardless of value, for which rea
son those who attended secured, to their da
light, tremendous bargains. On account of dis
solution of partnership the entire stock of this
firm will be sold out at auction, positively
without limit or reserve. The most valuable

At the expiration of the war he went to

he was awarded first prize, but will afford
greater utility than would be possible
were the original design carried out in
Its entirety. Professor .William Carey
Jones, one of the Hearst trustees for the
development of the State University, has
prepared the following statement of the
status of the plans:
University of California,
January IS. Ijoo.
Architect Eenard la now on his way to Parts.
full of enthusiasm in the work of revising his
designs lor the Phebe A. Hearst architectural
plan. The purpose of his visit to California
was entirely completed before his departure.
After the award of the jurors. M. Benard was
invited by Mrs. Hearst and tho trustees of fhe
architectural plan to coma to California to
confer with them and consider the modifica
tions necessary tn his designs. Now, having
gotten together all the necessary data and au
thentlo Information, ha has returned to Paris,
there to elaborate his plan. He felt that ho
could do his work to much better advantage
In his own atelier and with his own trained
draughtsmen than In California, where he
would be subject to many distractions.
It Is well that the public should know exact
ly what la being done and what Is contem
plated. In the international competition, closed
by the award last September, absolute free
dom from all restrictions as to cost was given
to the architects. They were likewise given
large latitude to exceed the space limits of the
university grounds. They were not required
to regard the existing buildings. I The success
which attended the competition must. In great
measure, be attributed to this liberty of treat
ment allowed the architects.
Bu now, after this try-out, a different con
dition of things presents Itself. It is no longer
an ideal problem. It is now a practical prob
lem. M. Benard quickly comprehended this,
and says that he will give us a practicable plan
as perfect and beautiful as is his Ideal one.
In fact, he says that we shall be even better
pleased with the results of his new work than
we were with his former.
The great general lines of Benard's scheme
will be preserved. The axis will remain the
same, the broad avenues, the spacious squares,
the generous flexible features of the prize plan,
will be found in the new. The dimensions of
the buildings and of groups of buildings will be
reduced to proper proportions. Buildings which
are not needed In the near future will be
omitted from the plan. For instance, only
one auditorium will be provided. This will
have a maximum seating capacity of 3500. It
will be so arranged that portions can be shut
off, and the seating: accommodation win come
down to 2000 or 1500.
The groupings of the buildings will be re
arranged. All of the structures appearing on
the hill-slope In the prize plan will be placed
In other positions. The astronomical observa
tory alone will be left to crown the summit
of the 900-foot hill. Circling the base of this
hill, space will be left for dormitories and
other dwellings. There will be two main
groups of buildings: one group for natural and
applied science, and the other for the literary
and philosophical studies.
The science group will comprise agriculture,
botany, zoology, geology and mineralogy and
mining as the main elements. In the center
of this group will be the museum for natural
history. Close by the college of mining will
be the college of mechanics and electricity,
and convenient to them both the buildings for
civil engineering, mathematics and drawing.
The buildings for physics and chemistry will
have places apart from this group.
The heads or representatives of all the de
partments at Berkeley conferred with M. Be
nard and gave him specifications of the needs
of their several departments. All the data
thus gathered were gone over in several con
ferences, which Included Mrs. Hearst, Presi
dent Wheeler, Regent Relnstetn. Professors
Jones and Maybeck and M. Benard. As a re
sult a definitive programme was agreed upon
for the elaboration of a plan by M. Benard.
The present limits of the university grounds
will not be greatly If at all exceeded by the
revised plan. The cost of the completed scheme
of buildings will not be excessive, will not be
more than will commend Itself to the Judg
ment of the people of California. The trustees
of the architectural plan have held as their
extreme standard of cost that buildings should
not represent In Â»nterest a figure that exceeded
the income for educational purposes. It Is
PARK POLICEMAN
CLEVERLY STOPS
RUNAWAY TEAM
Averts a Serious
Accident.
Pars; Policeman J. H. Kavanagh distin
guished himself yesterday afternoon In
Golden Gate Park by a very clever Jis
play of nerve and good horsemanship In
stopping a runaway team of horses, pre
venting what certainly would have been
a serious accident.
Arthur Rodgers, senior member of the
law firm of Kodgers, Paterson & Slack,
accompanied by nis wife and daughter,
was enjoying a ride through the park
late yesterday afternon In what Is known
as a double coupe, drawn by two heavy
carriage horses driven by a coachman.
On the main drive Just opposite Straw
berry Hill the horses became unmanage
able and started on a run. The coachman
lost control and was unable to chec-K
them. Being hitched short and close to
the coupe, at every step the animals were
struck by the whlffletrees. This added
to their fright and Increased their head
long speed.
The team had torn along the drive for
about half a mile when Officer Kavanagn
noticed its approach. Starting his horse
In the direction the runaways were head
ing, he got in ahead of them and regu
lated his speed to allow them to catch up.
When the team was almost upon him the
policeman grasped the bridle of the near
horse and tried to check the speed of the
runaways, but on account of the closeness
of the coupe the slightest swerve brought
the animals' legs against the vehicle.
For nearly a mile Kavanagh held on to
the bridle and kept the team on the main
drive, gradually slackening the gait of
the runaways until the speed track was
reached, when, by an adroit move, he
turned the horses Into that drive and soon
had them under control.
During the entire Incident the fright
ened occupants of the coupe cried lustily
to the coachman, though they made no
effort to jump out. Those who witnessed
the clever capture of the runaway team
Â¦were loud In their praise of the officer's
brave act, and declared It to be a display
of cool judgment and great horsemanship
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 19,-1900.
HIGHBINDER PLOT TO
BLOW UP A BUILDING
Startling Discovery Made by the
Police Authorities.
Acting Chief Biggy and Consul General
Ho Vow Arrange With Merchants
for Cessation of Hostilities.
TERROR in the Chinese quarter over
the treacherous highbinder war has
not abated. The direful conse
quer.ces which may fellow were re
vealed last night to the police by the dis
covery that not only guns will be used
as the instruments with which human
lives are to be taken, but that the force
of dynamite may be felt that the lawless
highbinders may settle their difficulties
with blood.
Last night the police uncovered a plot
to destroy a large three-story building at
711 Commercial street, near Kearny. The
yarning letter which foretold the possi
ble tragedy is now in the possession of
the officers, and patrols have been placed
en the premises that the plotters n.av
have no opportunity of carrying their
plans into execution.
The occupant of the premises against
â¢whom the plotters have their grievance is
Jue Hun, a wealthy merchant and con
tractor for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany. Why any attempt should be made
to destroy his life and property Jue Bun
is unable at present to state, but he te
lieves that he has been selected as a vic
tim by one of the tongs now at war.
Theletter revealing the plot was placed
in possession of the police In Chinatown
last night. It was found secreted in the
letter box of The occupants of the third
etory of the house. It told of the plan
to destroy the building in which Jue I3un
lived, and warned other residents of the
place to vacate with all possible speed.
A clause was also inserted cautioning the
people who received the communication to
remain silent or their lives would be for
feited. The epistle was evidently intended
to be read by Jue Lee. another merchant,
and Lee Gum Quor.p. as their names were
mentioned. In substance it read:
All people on the top floor of this building
must vacate. Jue Lee and Lee Gum Quor.K
move quickly. The building; will be destroyed.
It may be to-nlpht. It may be this week and it
may be next week. I cannot say when. Jue
!Â¦.:-. will die. Powder may be UFed and per
haps fire. Say nothing of this warning or you
may die, but heed It Quickly.
Jue Bun lives in the second story of
the building. The lower floor is occupied
by another merchant. When he received
the message he at once gave it to the
police, who consider it a very serious
matter. A detail of officers was dispatched
Immediately to guard the place. The
Chinamen who were warned left the place
and could not.be seen last night.
Bun if a member of the Kong Chow
Tonp. He disclaim? any membership In
the warring tongs, but says that he is In
directly connected with them. As con
tractor for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany he employs more than $00 men, most
of whom are Suey Sings. The Hop Sing
Tong has evinced no determination to
cease hostilities until they have revenge
on the Suey Sings. Jue Bun's businesa
relations with members of the rival tons:
is the theory accepted by the police.
Jealousy is given as another motive, but
the scheme could only be carried out on
the part of a large body of men and the
whole affair is laid at the door of -he
tongs.
Acting Chief of Police Biggy met last
night forty loading merchants of China
town through an arrangement made by
Consul General Ho Vow, who is exerting
his influence to make peace among his
countrymen. Before the Chief would con
pent to the meeting he was assured that
certain demands he had made would be
respected. As a result the hearty co
operation of the Six Companies and the
Merchants' Association was promised.
Whether the influence of the merchants
or their offers of rewards will check fu
ture murders is yet a conjecture, but it
is the general opinion that it will not.
The most important concession made to
acting Chief Biggy was the promise of the
merchants that they would surrender to
the police the presidents and secretaries
of the warring tongs. That this may be
accomplished a reward of $"00 was offered
for each president and another of $200 for
each secretary. The compact also includ
ed the surrender of the highbinders who
have been committing crime, with evi
dence sufficient to convict. For this pur
pose the Chinese merchants have posted
the following rewards: 5600 for the arrest
and conviction of a murderer, $100 for the
arrest and conviction of any person at
tempting murder and $10 for the arrest
and conviction of any Chinaman carrying
concealed weapons. Half the above re
wards will be paid upon the apprehension
of any of the criminals and the other half
upon "their conviction.
Acting Chief Biggy also demanded that
the tong system be abolished In China
town, and that the books of such organi
zations be turned over to him. The first
demand, he was informed, was impossible,
as tongs would exist as long as two
Chinamen lived together. The second, he
was also told, was hard to accomplish,
because the tong leaders, hearing that a
requisition had been made for their rec
ords, could easily destroy them.
A fund of $17,500 exists for the pay
ment of rewards for the apprehension of
criminals. This money, the merchants
claim, will be spent freely and without
reservation. A private detective system
will be inaugurated and a special fund has
been reserved for it. Should any secret
agent of the merchants or police be
wounded in an effort to secure evidence
against the highbinders, he will secure a
liberal pension, the amount of which re
mains yet to be fixed. Should he be
killed, his family will receive $600 In
cash.
Last night Captain "Wittman visited
Chinatown in search of Chinamen with
out the certificates required by the immi
, gration laws.
