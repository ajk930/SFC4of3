NOT RAISING THE SIEGE.
LONDON, Feb. 27.â Winston Churchill,
in a dispatch to the Morning Post from
Frere Camp, dated Sunday, says: -
"The idea that the Boers are raising the
siege of Ladysmith is premature. -The
advance Is being pursued In the face of
the most ' stubborn opposition and of
heavy loss. President Kruger*s grandson
is among the Boer killed." â¢
Mr. Churchill then proceeds to describe
the heavy fighting of Friday, In which the
Innlskilllngs approached within 500 yards
of the summit of a rocky Boer position
and then gallantly charged in the face of
a hall^of bullets. He" says:
"Aft^r repeated attempts, however, and
having lost heavily, they .recognized that
they were unable to prevail. Neverthe
less, they refused to retreat, but lay down
on the slope behind a shelter of walls.
The Connaughts and the Dublin Fusileers
were sent to their support, but the light
faded and the night closed In before thÂ«
main attack had . developed."

Alcalde at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 28.â The sealing
schooner Alcalde arrived in port to-day
from British Columbia for, water and pro
visions. She has 120 seal pelts aboard
hourly growing worse. British
engineers are sapping up to his
position from both sides of the
river, making regular siege
trenches, which will bring the
British closer to the Boers daily
until they are near enough to
make an assault. Lord Roberts'
guns now command every point
of the Boer position. One thing
seems clearâ that Cronje took
away with him the big guns that
used to reply to Methuen's na
val weapons along the Modder
River. That is no small feat fof
itself, for if they could be taken
back to Pretoria they would
strengthen materially the defense
of that city.

of the Past so Far as War

In Introducing the Naval Estimates in the
Commons the First J-ord of the Admiralty
Says Great Britain Must Keep Up With
the Pace Set by Other Powers.
T ONDON, Feb. 26.â 1n tntrodncms
1 the naval estimates In the House of
I Commons to-day Mr. George J.
I j Goschen, the First Lord of the Ad
miralty, said there was nothing
spasmodic or sensational therein. The
total; with the expected additions, would
be Â£30,000,000. There had been complaints
that the estimates would be sensational,
but the Government fully realized the sit
uation and knew the nation expected the
navy to be prepared for all emergencies,
and the estimates were framed on that
footing. Nothing, he continued, had
been put down for the mobilization of the
fleet. If mobilization should be necessary
the Government would not hesitate to mo
bilize and come to Parliament for the
money, but he thought the time had not
arrived for taking that course and ho
hoped it would not arrive.
Continuing. Mr. Goschen said that Great
Britain was not menaced by any naval
power. Europe knew her strength and
the number of ships she possessed. There
werfÂ» times when a demonstration was ad
visable, but the Government did not think
It advisable upon this occasion/
..Goschen also said that hereafter ships
of the reserve squadron, instead of going
singly for' firing practice, would act to
gether and adopt protective tactics in ad
dition. Regarding the export of coal. Mr.
Goschen announced that the Government
could rot prohibit it unless at war with
a foreign power or In an emergency very
different from the present one. The Ad
miralty, he farther asserted, was consid
ering how It could.orgapL?fi.anaval_re
serve In conjunction with the colonies. HÂ«
explained that with an adequate organi
zation* ', the Government could get a very
valuable contingent from Canada and
Australia. The negotiations with Canada
wers very well advanced. Canada asked
that the period of training be reduced,
hut a final decision on the subject had not
been reached.
Dealing with the construction of fresh
Ironclads. Mr. Goschen remarked that
The Hague convention already seemed a
thing 6f the past. When the peace con
ference was called he suggested that pos
sibly the beginning of further building of
battleships might be suspended with the
view of ascertaining the sentiments of
the conference. Great Britain alone, he
added, suggested a reduction of arma
ments, but nothing was done, and In the
six months since the conference more gi
gantic programmes stretching forward
eight, sixteen and eighteen years had been
put forward than ever before had entered
the minds of the powers. Great Britain
proposed to spend In 1900-1301 Â£8.460,000;
Russia Â£4.300.000 and France Â£4454,009. the
two latter countries spending Â£8.454.000,
or Â£6000 less than Great Britain. The re
port of the French naval committee had
asserted that the material was 40 per cent
and labor 10 per cent higher in Franca
than in England, and Mr. Goschen there
forÂ© Judged that the cost of shipbuilding
In France and Russia nveraged 20 per
cent dearer than in Great Britain.
"Therefore." he explained, "our expen
diture of Â£8,460,000 gives Great Britain an
advantage of Â£1.700,000, or enough to
build an additional Ironclad and a cruiser.
These large foreign programmes must
not alarm the country, but we must keep
abreast of these great developments or
naval power which have occurred not
only In Europe, but In the United States
and Japan."

BOERS ASSEMBLE NEAR BLOEMFONTEIN
TO DISPUTE THE BRITISH INVASION
w ONDON, Feb. 27, 4:20 a. m.â The Boers are assembling an army near Bloemfontein with which to
JL-*/ dispute the invasion of Lord Roberts. This intelligence comes from. Pretoria by way of Lou
renzo Marques. The commandos 'are described as "hastening from all quarters of the two repub
lics." No estimate is made of their numbers, but the withdrawal of the Boers from most of the places
where they have been in contact with the British, . except the district near Ladysmith, may raise the re
sisting force. to 30,000 men. This .figure assumes that the Boers have between 60,000 and 70,000
; men in* the field. The gathering of this army across the path of Lord Roberts , gives significance to Gen
eral Cronje's j steadfast defense. He has engaged the corps of Lord Roberts for ten days now, andwhether
he is relieved or not he has given time for. the dispersed Boer factions to get together and prepare posi
tions to receive the British advance when Cronje is overcome and Lord Roberts moves forward. Â¦
Â¦'It' is. difficult to conceive .that the Boers are strong enough to take the offensive and to rescue
General Cronje from his precarious situation.
The War Office had nothing after midnight to indicate his collapse, and he. may hold out for a
few. days. The correspondents seem to have no exact information respecting his resources. Some say:
he has plenty of food, ; but is short ' of ,â¢ ammunition.' . Others' assert that ' he abandoned . his â¢ food supplies
but kept abundant^ supplies of cartridges.,' -f" , ''*?'" ~ * '
i This statement was. made to a reporter
by, Philip ! Lenter Wessels of Bloemfon
tein, .brother- 'of- the President of the
jVolksraad of the Orange Free State, who
arrived, hero several days ago to raise
funds for Boer widows and orphans.
! "And even if General Cronje's forces
should surrender," added "Mr. Wessels,
,"that would not: end the war. We have
done- the British no wrong and we have
never -deserved the underhanded tricks
they. have employed upon us since the
first."
George W. Van Slclen, president of the
American-Boer Council, announces that
he .has,: just forwarded $2000 for Boer
widows and orphans -to Treasurer C. de
Villiers of the Afrikander Committee of
the Legislature at Cape Colony.
LONDON, Feb. 27.â The Dally
Mail has the following dispatch
from Paardeberg, dated Sunday:
"There are about 4000 beleaguered
Â¦ in General Cronje's camp, exclu-
Ei%-e of the losses he has jiltherto
sustained. His wife is not with
him, although there are women and
children in the cam;,.
"The Boer position is now almost
exclusively confined to the river
bed. The enemy are entirely at .
our mercy, but Lord Roberts is
treating them with great consider
ation from motives of humanity."
The memory of. Majuba Hill Is cherished by both Briton and Boerâ by the former to avenge the disgrace, and by the
latter as an inspiration to like deeds. The nineteen years that have elapsed since, that- eventful . and,, for .the British^
direful ;day have â¢ cooled none of the that were then engendered.. Majuba Hill Is a prominent
and peculiar,, height, a few miles south of the Transvaal border, standing 2000: fee t-above the: plain; below and 7000 feet
above.; the. level, of the sea. On 'his' defeat at Laing's Nek a short time before,' Sir George Colley, the British commander,
decided upon occupying the summit pf Majuba, as giving him an Impregnable position,.. commanding all the approaches
to and from the Transvaal. On Saturday night, February 26," with detachments from the -Gordon Highlanders, the Rifle
Brigade, Â¦ the Fifty-eighth Regiment and. the Naval Brigade, he ascended and occupied the top of the hill, . which Is a
plateau, about 1000 yards long, with a saucer-like depression in the center. They were attacked at. daylight by a force of
Boers under General Joubert, and after five hours' hard and Incessant fighting, during which they lost more than half of
their number, the British; troops broke and fled. Sir George Colley was killed as he^followed his men, and Sir Hector Mac-
Donald, now commanding the Highland Brigade, with Lord Roberts, was taken prisoner. Many 'other British officers. of
prominence," in "the present war were' at'Majuba Hill, as were many, of the- rank and file now fighting in South Africa.

ANNIVERSARY DAY OF THE BATTLE OF MAJUBA HILL
LONDON, Feb. 27.â The War Office has
pcccivcd the following dispatch from Lord
Roberts :
"PAARDEBERG, Feb. 27, 7:45 a. m.âGen
eral Cronje and all of his force capitulated
unconditionally at daylight and are now
prisoners in my camp. The strength of his
force will be communicated later. 1 hope
that her Majesty's Government will con
eider this event satisfactory, occurring as
it does on the anniversary of Majuba."
LONDON, Feb. 27.âDis
patches containing lists of
casualties were the only of
ficial news received from Gen
eral Roberts yesterday, and
idown to a late hour this morning
the situation at Paardeberg, with
Cronje securely held prisoner,
was apparently unchanged.
The precise point reached by
General Buller in his fourth ad
vance toward Ladysmith is not
known, but he is reported to
have made substantial progress
during the last few days. His ad-
vance has evidently been attend
ed by severe fighting, as the cas
ualty lists issued yesterday by
the War Office show that on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
he lost eight officers killed,
thirty-four wounded and one
missing. Not a single word as
to these encounters has yet been
received.
All the war correspondents
agree that the last position which
has to be carried before Lady
smith is reached by the relief
force is an exceedingly strong
one, and will likely cost the Brit
ish heavy losses. The Boers are
making a desperate fight, but
unless they know that the Lady
smith garrison are utterly unable
to co-operate with Buller, which
may be the case, they are run
ning great risks* in contesting
ground with strong British
forces in front of them and an
other in their rear.
In well-informed circles it is
thought that no official word is
likely to be received of the Na
tal fighting until the last and
hardest struggle to gain the
great ridge south of Ladysmith
has been decided.
There were the usual rumors
at the clubs last night that
Cronje had surrendered, but the
War Office announced after mid
night that it knew nothing of
this reported collapse.
From Ladysmith come reports
that the Free Staters have left
the neighborhood and that the
Boers are retreating. Yet it is
firmly believed here that the
hardest fighting of the entire
war confronts both Roberts and
Buller. The Daily News has a
dispatch from Lourenzo Mar
ques which states that 5000
burghers have left Ladysmith
for the Free State; that the
Boers are concentrating thirty
miles outside of Bloemfontein;
that the Free State Government
is moving to Winburg, and that
reinforcements from all parts are
pressing through Bloemfontein
hourly. President Steyn, ac
cording to this story, has tele
graphed President Kryger that
Lord Roberts is within a few
hours of Bloemfontein, and urges
that every male, irrespective ,of
nationality, should be comman
deered. President Steyn is said to
favor peace.
According to unofficial re
ports which reach London the
Boer commander's position is

The general debate in the House upon

gard of their rights, and against the vote
and protest of Thomas Lynch and H. C.
Frick, the two other members of the
board of directors, and well knowing that
the price of coke was then upward of $3
a ton, the majority of the directors of the
coke company voted to the steel company
a contract for all the coke it would use
for five years, commencing Ja nuary l^
1900, amounting approximately to 2,500,ww
tons a year, or about a third of the en
tire product of the coke company, at the
price of Jl 35 a ton.
Contract Repudiated.
The plaintiffs charge that In truth and
in fact no such agreement to sell Its prod
ucts to the steel company as is pretended
as the excuse for making said contract
and no agreement whatsoever for deliver
ies through a period of years, or at. the
price named in the pretended contract,
was at any time made byjhe > coke com
pany or by any ona authorized to act on
its behalf; and the pretense thereof is
only the creation of Directors Moreland.
Gayley. Clemson and Morrison, with Car
negie and Lauder acting in the interest
of Carnegie and the steel company; and
they so made said contract only for the
benefit of said Carnegie and themselves
as members of the steel company, and In
bad faith to the interest of all other
stockholders of the coke company.
Willis F. Cook of counsel for the
coke company said to-night -that while
the bill asked for an injunction, this point
would not be insisted upon until the case
went to final hearing. The coke company
would continue furnishing coke to the
steel company as at present until the caÂ»e
was decided, when an adjustment would
be made.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 26.â Marcus
Daly, the millionaire miner of
Montana, was the principal
witness before the Senate Com
mittee on Privileges and Elec-,
tions to-day. He was on the ; stand for
about two hours, and at the expiration
of that time was excused on the plea that
he was not well and that the questioning
process fatigued him. Daly confessed
that he had contributed $20,000 or $25,000 to
the prosecution of this case, but asserted
that he had not entered into any con
spiracy before Clark's election to injure
him. He had not contributed any of the
$20,000 used in the Whiteside exposure. In
conclusion he tendered his checks and
checkbooks for inspection by the com
mittee. Clark listened attentively -to
Daly's testimony. '
Daly said he had contributed to the
campaign when it was organized to the>
extent of about $4600 and later to the ex
tent of $2500; also $500 in Deer Lodge
County and $250 on various other occa
sions. He had never, he said, sought to
compel miners employed by him to vote
according to his sentiments. As to White
side, he said he had given him nothing
for the purpose of defeating Clark.
"Did you ever during the session of the
Legislature give any money toward the
deieat of Mr. Clark?"
"No, I did not; not one dollar," he re
plied.
Liberal Contributions.
Daly was asked as to the $30,000 which
is on deposit with the committee and is
alleged to have been bribe, money. He
said he knew nothing about this money
and had nothing to do with advancing it,
as had been intimated.
"Are you one of the contributors toward
this prosecution?" he was asked.
"Yes," answered Daly.
"He wont on to say -that after Clark s
nomination Clark had charged ,that he
was the subject of a "conspiracy, and as
Clark courted an investigation Daly said
he concluded to permit the matter, to be
thoroughly investigated. Daly said that
Campbell. Whiteslde and several others
of the State Committee were those who
joined him in prosecuting this case. There
was to be a contribution to cover expenses
for hiring lawyers, expenses of witnesses,
etc. â¢
"How much have you contributed thus
far?" asked Hoar. . .
"I have not the checks." he replied, but
it amounts to between $20,000 and $25,000.
Faulkner directed the cross-examina
tion. Hia first question related to Daly s
participation In various local elections of
Montana. This, the witness said, did not
extend beyond Silver Bow and Deer
Lodge counties, as his business interests
took him there most. He knew little as to
what was going on elsewhere beyond
what he saw in the papers.
Daly said he did ; not know the
other contributors to the campaign except
that he understood Clark gave $500. As to
the campaign in Silver Bow, he thought
the candidates furnished most of the
money. He had given $2600 to Silver Bow
and the candidates had taken care of the
rest. . . , . Â¦' Â¦ Â¦ .
"That was a small contribution," said
Faulkner: Â¦
"Yes," answered Daly: "I was not much
interested."
"Then, when you are interested," pur
sued Faulkner, "you pull out more
freely?" .
"It depends how much I am interested,"
answered Daly. :-s.y-:.?

Daly said his secretary had made the
advance to prosecute this case. He him
self was sick, so that after being present
at the conference when the agreement to
contribute was made he told his secretary
to advance the sums to Campbell as It
became necessary. He did riot place a

CARNEGIE COMPANY
ACCUSED OF FRAUD
Charged With Robbing Stockholders
of a Coke Concern of Which It
Has Gained' Control.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. 25. âJohn
Walker, guardian of Andrew Carnegie
Wilson. S. L. Schoomaker and John
Pontefract. on behalf of themselves and
such other stockholders of the H. C. Frick
Company as may choose to join in the suit
as plaintiffs, filed the much-talked-of bill
in equity to annul the contract with the
coke company by the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. Limited, in Common Pleas Court
No. 2 late this afternoon. The action Is
remotely connected with the trouble now
existing between H. C. Frick. former
chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company,
Limited, and Andrew Carnegie, and was
precipitated by the filing of Frick'e bill In
t-quity in Common Pleas Court No. 1 to
secure an accounting of the affairs of
the Carnegie Steel Company. Limited.
In the case the plaintiffs seek to re
strain the defendants by injunction from
celling, shipping or delivering any coke
to the Carnegie Steel Company, Limited,
under a contract dated January 1, 1&99, at
a. price of $1 25 a ton, the contract to run
for a period of five years, and from set
tling with the steel company for coke al
ready delivered under contract. It is also
tisked that the court annul the contract
and order an accounting.
The plaintiffs allege fraud in the ob
taining of the coke contract and accuse
a majority of the board of directors of
the coke company of working solely for
the interest of the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. Limited, with the purpose of cheat-
Ing and defrauding all stockholders of the
coke company not members of the steel
company. It is claimed that if the con
tract be carried out the Flick Coke Com
pany will have to refund to the steel com
pany $096,000 on account of coke sold to
the steel company during the year 1899,
and during the year 1900 it will cause . a
lo6s to the coke company of not less than
$4,000,000.
Carnegie Controls the Company. â¢
The capital of the coke company is
$10,000,000. and it is set "forth in the com
plaint that the ownership of a majority
of the 6hares has enabled the Carnegie
6teel Company, Limited, and Carnegie to
select their nominees as directors of the
coke company and dominate and control
their action. -
Some time in the year 1899. it is stated.
the steel company and Carnegie set up the
pretense that the coke company had con
tracted to sell to it coke at $1 35 a ton.
After this came to the knowledge of the
president of the coke company he sub
mitted it for the consideration of the
board of directors at their meeting on Oc
tober 25. 1899, and thereupon the board
passed the following resolutions:
Resolved. That the president be authorized
and instructed to notify the Carneglti Steel
Company (limited) that the existence of any
contract la denied and that no claim to Â«ettle
in accordance with the term* of the alleged
contract for past, present or fatura deliveries
of coket to the said Carnegie Steel Company
(limited) waa recognized or entertained by this
company.
Previous to January, 1900, the board of
directors of the coke company was com
posed of five men. Upon that date, at a
meeting of the stockholders of the com
pany the membership of the board was
increased to seven, and Thomas Lynch,
H. C. Frick, George Lauder, James Gay
'ley, Andrew D. Moreland, D. M. Clemson
and Thomas Morrison were elected mem
bers. They. now compose the board of di
rectors of the coke company, Lauder,
Gayley, Moreland, Clemson and Morrison
being also members of the board of man
agers of the steel company. ; â¢;Â¦â¢
Directors Own No Stock.
Prior to January 9, 1900, it is said, nei
ther Gayley, Moreland, Clemson nor Mor
rison were owners of any stock in the
coke company, and were interested there
in only by virtue of their interests In the
steel company. About this date five
shares of the coke company stock was
transferred to each of these men by the
steel company. These shares, it is as
serted, are still the property of the steel
company* and the transfers were made at
the dictation of the steel company and
Carnegie for the purpose of qualifying
them as directors. It is asserted that they
were so placed as to manage the coke
company in the Interest of the other
stockholders of the coke company who
were not members of the steel company,
and especially so that the product of the
coke company might be sold at prices far
below the face value of any market price
thereof, so as to benefit the steel company
at the expense of the coke company. Car
negie's interest being much greater in the
steel company.
During the year 1599 the coke company
furnished the steel company with all its
coke. While the market price of coke
eteadlly advanced, coke was sold to the
steel company at prices ranging from $1 45
per ton for January, February and March,
1899, and $1 75 for December 1899, the ship
ments being 2,233,764 tons, all of which has
been paid for.
To carry out the purpose for which they
were selected and to secure for them
selves and Carnegie an advantage as
members of the steel company, it is
Marcus Daly, the Political Rival of Clark.
Marcus Daly Is big, broad-shouldered, deep-chested and powerful. Ho is 6
feet tall, weighs 225 pounds and has the muscles of an athlete. He is of the
mercurial and choleric Irish temperament, genial to friends, vindictive to an
enemy, quick of speech and given to a lusty swear word on occasions. His
carelessness of dress, his friends say, reflects his disinclination to master de
tails of business, at which he looks only In Its larger aspects.
RECEIVERS APPOINTED
FOR THE FLOUR TRUST
Financial Collapse of the Great Com
bine Which Controlled Mills in
MILWAUKEE, Wls., Feb. 26.â The
United States Milling Company, generally
known as the flour trust, collapsed yester
day afternoon, but the fact did not be
come known until to-day, when Judge
Jenkins, In proceedings ancillary to the
United States Court of New Jersey, ap
pointed three receivers for the company,
two of whom are now in charge of the
property. The receivers are: Daniel
Thomas of New York, Charles E. Kim
ball of Summit, N. J., and Albert C. Lor
lng of Minneapolis. The collapse of the
company was due, it is said, to inability
to float its securities on the open market.
In his complaint George William Ballou
of New Jersey, the stockholder who in
stitutes the suit in which the receivers are
appointed, makes the following statement
concerning the causes leading to the fall
urÂ» of the company:
In the organization of the company it had
been' hoped that sufficient means would be pro
vided tor the purchase or the property required
by the company and to supply sufficient work-
Ing capital to carry on its business by the sale
of Its first mortgage collateral gold bonds, but
because of the tight money market and the
depression In Industrial securities the company
was unable to carry out the plan and was
obliged to resort to borrowing money on Its
collateral trust bonds and otherwise urged to
secure a temporary loan by Its Issue of so
called trust bonds, and further, by the failure
of this plan, by borrowing In open market. The
money so borrowed constitutes the floating In
debtedness, which amounts to $1,095,508 08, of
which $149,365 Is due and $394,850 is on demand
loans.
Controlled Many Mills.
The United States Milling Company was
formed with a capital stock of $25,000,000
on April 27, 1899, having secured control of
the following flour milling property:
In Milwaukee, â¢ the Daisy and Faist-
Kraus mills.
In Superior, the Lake Superior, the An
chor and the Listmann mills.
In west Superior, the Grand Republic,
the Freeman and the Minkota mills.
In Minneapolis, the Excelsior, the
Standard and St. Anthony mills, together
with 95 per cent of the capital stock of
the Northwestern Consolidated Milling
Company, which operates and owns five
big flour mills. .
In Duluth, the Imperial and the con
structed Terminal elevators.
In New York State, the Syracuse mills,
the Baldwlnsville mill, the Urban mill.
In New Jersey, 95 per cent of the Heck
er-Jones Milling Company, Â¦ which owns
and operates four large mills.
To-day's proceedings will be insti
tuted in â¢ every circuit where the com
pany owns property. The bond fixed by
the New Jersey court is $100,000 in each
case. Judge Jenkins requires the receiv
ers to give an additional bond of $25,000
each. While the original suit is in New
Jersey, the greatest litigation probably
will be in Wisconsin, as the majority of
the company's properties is in this State.
Ballou says he had made a 1a 1 careful in
vestigation of the affairs of the company
and is satisfied that it is wholly, insol
vent. The company. Mr. Ballou sets forth,
will be unable to meet any of Its obliga
tions as they mature. Its cash in the
bank is but $1000 and it has no bills or ac
counts receivable the proceeds of which
would be sufficient to meet the matured
and maturing obligations. ;â¢Â¦ >
INTENDS. TO BEOBGANIZE.
Proposed Rehabilitation of the Col
lapsed Combine.
' NEW YORK, Feb. 26.â The . United
States Milling Company was organized
last May with sixteen mills In the prin
cipal milling cities of, the country. 1 Last
year the Â¦ bonds of the company took â¢ a
tunable and . it was found that the' com
pany could not go on under Its manage
ment as then conducted. To add to com
plexities, the Hecker-Jones-Jewell Co.
stockholders, who had come into the con
solidation some time ago, brought a suit
looking to withdrawal.
On January 2, a reorganization commit
tee started at work to reorganize the
company. The members of this commit
tee are: General Thomas, Edwin Gould,
B. E. Simmons, W. Van Norden, Brayton
Ives, William L. Bell and Thomas Mcln
tyre. To-day was set as the limit date
for the deposit of stock for the reorgani
zation.
"This appointment of i receiver," I said
George Ballou, secretary of the organiza
tion committee, "was asked for by a
stockholder and was forced upon us by
creditors, but has been carried through
with the consent of the committee. It was
inevitable and the best thing to do. Just
about this time a large number of obli
gations are coming due, especially in the
West, and the receivership was the only
solution of the problem.
"It will help on the reorganization. It
will secure- stockholders who have been
holding out. The committee will now go
In and carry out Its scheme of reorgani
zation to the end without trouble. To-day
being the last day for the deposit of
stock for reorganization had nothing to
do with the appointment of the receiver.
The committee had already enough stock
in hand, together with the securities we
have made loans on and can force in, to
declare the plan of the reorganization op
erative." \,i
A meeting of the reorganization com
mittee was held this afternoon, but the

made after Clark had accused him and
others of a "villainous coneplracy." Daly
explained his acquaintance with White
side, who had built a block at Butte for a
firm In which Daly.v was Interested.
Faulkner took the witness over the con
versation with Corbett and Daly denied
the conversation as given by Corbett. He
denied ever having . said that Clark's
friends would be sent to the penitentiary.
. "I have not the slightest personal feel
ing against Mr. Clark- or the members of
his family ," declared â¢ Daly, "and any
statement of that kind is a villainous He."
Members of the committee sugjested
that' no testimony had been given that
Daly was" unfriendly to Clark's -family.'
"But I 'am dealing' with tnat chap's,
question," he replied, amid a roar at his
designation -of Faulkner as "that chap."
; Daly denied having authorized the send
ing .of Pat Conlan to Flathead County,
during the State campaign. He asserted
that he knew of no money having been
spent in the Legislature in the interest of
House bill No. 214. Daly said he thought
Tbble's estimate of the amount of money
expended in behalf of Anaconda In the
capital contest in 1594 was about right.
He had not handled the money, but he did
not believe the amount exceeded J350.000.
The companies which might be described .i
as subsidiary to the Anaconda company '
had given $200,000.
"Do you remember a conversation' you
had with J. R. Toole previous to the meet
ing of the Legislature, in which you said
you would put up $75,000 to beat Mr.
Clark?" he was asked. â
"I have never had such conversation
with Toole or any one else."
Daly then complained .of feeling ex
hausted on account of Illness and he was
excused.

sufficient to say we have no like principles of
law as to "powers" In thiÃ State. As I read
the opinion of Mr. Justice Harrison. It goes
to the length of holding that a transfer and
conveyance from the trustees to the benefici
aries is not demanded by the terms of the will.
I believe such contradiction of the Instrument
does violence to the meanlns and use of the
simplest and most ordinary words. If words
mean anything, if a party's Intentions are to
be determined by his words, it must be held
that James G. Fair intended that the trustees
should pass the title to the beneficiaries by
deed. If the words here used do not express
that purpose, then It cannot be expressed in
words. I know no word in the English vocab
ulary the use of which in this will would add
point, force and clearness to the words "trans
fer and convey." If the words "transfer and
convey" were used In a- power of attorney
there would be no trouble in giving them the
usual and ordinary meaning. Why should
there be trouble here? In the early stages of
the litigation, when the validity of this trust
warn not a burning question, the trustees them
selves thought that James G. Fair intended to
vest them with the title to the property, and
so construed the will, for by their verified plead
ing they declared the title to be absolutely
vested In them. This court is not authorized
to give the will a forced construction, but sim
ply to give it a natural construction: and when
that construcion is given, it, let the law take
Its course, wherever it may lead.
It is- substantially conceded that a deed to
the trustees in triint to "transfer and convey"
at once to tho children of Fair or to any. other
class of beneficiaries would be. void as creating
a trust forbidden by our statute, namely, a
trust to convey land. But It is held that a
deed to the trustees in trust for . the use of
Fair's children durin? their life,, and then to
"transfer and convey" to other parties, Is
valid as not creating a trust to convey. Cer
tainly, to an ordinary mind the soundness of
this reasoning Is not satisfactory. There is
no reason why a trust to "transfer and con
vey" is, or should be, transformed Into a de
vice co lnstantl by the mere insertion In the
Instrument of a clause that the land for a lim
ited period should be held by the trustees, and
the rents and profits during that time applied
In other directions. To my mind, as far as
this question is concerned, such a clause oper
ates simply as a fixing of the day when the
trustees shall make the conveyance to the bene
ficiaries. This r case stands exactly as though
the trustees under the will were required to
apply the proceeds of the lands to the support
of Fair's children for the period of twelve
months, and thereupon "transfer and convey"
those lands to the beneficiaries named. It
would seem under those -circumstances that a
trust to convey land was Intended to be cre
ated, and -tested by the law of this State ex
necessitate was created. . .
Opinion of Attorneys.
The attorneys for the children of Sen
ator Fair were in no mood to talk about
the decision last- night. Charles S.
Wheeler said that he had made It a rule
not to be interviewed and would not talk
about the matter In any way. He had
no opinion that he would express about
what course the Fair children would now
take: nor would he say anything about
the effect that the decision would have in
entrenching the trustees of the estate for
life. Â¦ Attorney Heggerty talked a little.
He took the view that the. trustees were
now confirmed in tenure. until the Fair
children should all be dead, and also said
that Mrs. Craven could hope only to get
$30 under the will if she could convince
the courts that she. was Fair's widow.
I,afe Pence "on the contrary said that
the decision would not affect the rights of
Mrs. Fair to one-third of the. income of
the estate and one-third of .the real and
personal property. ' She was â¢ not a party
to the action and was not bound by the
Judgment.. She was free to attack and
defeat the trust clause of the will of Sep
tember 21, 1894 v and to secure one-third of
the estate and of the income, even though
the children were bound by the' decision
That decision by the Supreme Court would
not be followed when the trust clause was
attacked by her. She could attack. on two
grounds. One was that there was an-un
lawful accumulation of Income, amount
ing to $500,000 per annum, under para
graphs 15 and 22 of the will, which, snould
any- of the children .survive 60 years,
would, as it compounded, result in a for
tune in. the hands of . the trustees many
times greater than the whole value of the
present estate; and sections 723 and 724 of
the Civil Code made such accumulations
unlawful. Paragraph 15 of the will pro
vided that in the event of the death of
the twodoughters without issue two
thirds of the Income must accumulate â¢in
the hands of the trustees until after the
death of Charles L. Fair. . This might b<?
tifty years hence, and the accumulations
at the end : of that time would-be many
millions of dollars greater than the pres
ent total. value of the estate. In neither
case was the accumulation limited to the
minority, of a beneficiary; nor was it pos
sible for the trustees, or the court, to de
termine or name any person to whom the
income could be paid. The collateral kin
living to-day might all die before the chil
dren. These points might be presented by
the attorneys for Mrs. Fair on a rehear
ingiof.the case just decided by, the , Su
preme. Court, but. Mrs. Fair, was not a
party to that litigation and the attorneys
had. some hesitation about offering their
services as amicus curlae. , â¢

ticular and all the Fair forces in gen
eral, but she managed to restrain herself
and her opinion of 'Pierson was not ex
pressed. It would rfut take a mind
reader however, to divine what it Is.
Mrs. Craven-Fair has a way of looking a
whole lot of things, and it is not neces
sary for her to open her mouth to make
herself very thoroughly understood.
Nightshirt Waved Again.
The late Senator Fair's silken night
robe was waved again, but only for a
brief moment, not long enough In. fact to
bring a blush to any one In the court
room.
Senator Fair's manner of treating his
alleged wife was a subject in whicn the
attorneys appeared greatly interested. Ac
cording to Airs. Craven-Fair the Senator
was an ideal hubby. She never had to
ask him for money, and he was so par
ticular that she snould be well supplied
that he left plies of twenties wherever she
was likely to rind them. Even before the
marriage contract was signed he was lib
eral with his cash, for he slipped a hand
ful of gold into her pocket one day, with
the remark that he thought she might
have use for a little spending money.
To controvert this testimony the Fair
attorneys claimed that during the time
Mrs. Craven-Fair claims she was so abun
dantly supplied with funds by the Senator
she was discounting her salary warrants
as principal of the Mission Grammar
School and otherwise sparring around for
ready money. The witness admitted that
this was the fact, but was prepared with
a plausible explanation for her actions.
The petitioner went on the witness stand
as soon as the case was called. Attorney
Pierson asked for the pencil deeds, dated
September 8, 1894, conveying to "Mrs. Net
tle R. Craven" property on Mission street
and the realty and improvements on the
southwest corner of Pine and Sansome
streets. She identified them and stated:
."Those are the deeds I referred to last
Wednesday as the provision made for me
by Senator Fair in lieu of bequeathing
me anything in his will." A letter from
Fair to the witness, dated December 16,
1894. was also produced, and all of the
documents were marked for identifica
tion.
He Was an Ideal Hubby.
Speaking of the manner in which Fair
had provided for her during his lifetime
she said;
"He did everything for me that a hus
band possibly could. He left money for
me everywhere about my house, generally
$200 or $300 at a time. Once he sent me a
package of greenbacks to- the Mission
Grammar School by the janitor. 1 had
sent a message to the Senator, and when
the Janitor returned with the reply he
brought the greenbacks."
"Did you send for the money?"
"Oh, no; I never asked the Senator for
a cent. It was not necessary."
Then she testified that Fair had given
her a diamond ring. The attorneys want
ed to know all about it, even down to the
number of times the witness had worn it.
Attorney Charles Pence objected to the
line of the cross-examination, asserting
that it was a time-killing .enterprise cal
culated to wear out the court. To this
Mr. McEnerney retorted:
"It is the kind of examination that is
calculated to wear out some classes of
witnesses. We are going to proceed along
this line because we think this witness Is
fabricating and all her testimony is
false."
Fair never bought dresses for his al
leged wife, but he always supplied her
with funds to pay her dressmaker. Mrs.
Purcell. He is reported to have told the
lady of the thimble and thread not to
count on expense when building a gown
for Mrs. Craven-Fair, but to provide her
with everything in the dress line she
wanted. The only thing Mrs. Craven-Fair
did not get from the Senator was a
Christmas present or a token In commem
oration of the anniversary of their mar
riage.
To show that her story was an unrea
sonable one In some details, Attorney
Pierson asked if it was not a fact that
during Fair's lifetime and subsequent to
May 23. 1892, phe had shaved j her war
rants on the school fund in order to raise
some ready money. She admitted that
Mr. Pierson was close to being right but
claimed there was no money in the school
fund at the time and she was forced to
get some money to complete some Invest
ments she had made previous to hpr
marriage and of which the Senator had
not been Informed. -
She was asked to name those to whom

>
FOUR Justices of the Supreme Court
have decided that a trust to con
vey after the termination of lives
In being is not contrary to law, and
"the last will and testament" of
the late Senator James G. Fair has been
sustained in lie entirety. Accompanied
by that "sickly green light of despair
that accompanies the work of lyddite in
action," this decision fell like a bomb
among the children of the dead million
aire late yesterday afternoon. Its falling
almost took the breath of heirs and coun
sel alike, for with the word of the court
millions â about ten of themâ passed from
the bands of the children and made up a
fund from which three trustees will wax
fat while doling out accumulated Interest
to thoso the late (senator willed should
fchaxe it during the rest of their days on
eartn,
Children Surprised.
A condition of affairs entirely unexpect
ed now faces the three children of the late
Senator Fairâ Theresa A. Oelrichs. Vlr-
Cinla Vanderbilt and Charles 1* Fair. For
tome time past they have stood together
combating the claims of Mre. Nettie R.
Craven-Fair in the hope that the decision
rendered by Judge Slack declaring the
trust clause of the admitted will invalid
would be sustained by the higher tribu
nal and that a decree of distribution un
der Euch a decision would leave them
masters of the situationâ the adjusters of
millionsâ and in a position to dictate terms
to Mrs. Craven-Fair to suit their own
convenience, or to carry on the litigation
until she tired of the unequal struggle and
retired from the field. Most of the mil
lions of the late Senator Fair are now,
however, the trust property of W. S.
Goodfellow, James S. Angus and Thomas
Q. Crothers, and toward their hands the
children must stretch hands for their al
lotted income unless the Supreme Court re
verses itself and finds that it erred when
it upheld the will of the dead.
The Pencil Will Again.
A document which has flitted like a
epecter throughout the litigation over the
estate of the dead millionaire since the
filing of the first pleading and which Is
known as the "pencil will," has again
been made prominent by the decision sus
taining the trust clause in the will of
September 21, USii. When the attempt
was first made to probate the trust will it
If said that decedent's children, especial
ly Charies L. Fair, hailed the advent of
the so-called pencil will, executed Sep
terrber 24, 1594. presented by Mrs. Cra
ven-Fair, with delight. If acknowledged
this will would obviate the litigation over
the trust clause, but again it would es
tablish the genuineness of the pencil
deeds held by Mrs. Craven-Fair, which
JuJge Slack subsequently declared in
valid. This pencil will was offered for
probate, but after weary perigrtnations
finally found a resting place in the vaults
of the County Clerk's office. The question
that is now being asked is whether or
not this will will be aeain drawn forth
and tossed ir.to the boiling pot of litiga
tion with the consent of the children.
Various legal objections confront its pre
sentation in view of the decision of the
Supreme Court sustaining the trust will,
but It is the consensus of opinion that
the children will do something desperate
rather than lose control of the bulk of the
estate accumulated by their dead parent
efttr years of toil and speculation.
Two decisions were handed down in the
Supreme Court yesterday on the trust
clnuse of the Fair will. The prevailing
cplr.ion, sustaining the trust clause, was
written by Justice Harrison and con
curred in by Justices Temple and Hen
thaw. Justice Beatty wrote a concurring
opinion. Another opinion, dissenting from
the views expressed in the prevailing
opinion, was written by Justice McFar
land and concurred In by Justice Van
Dyke. Justice Garoutte also filed a dis
senting opinion. These decisions, in part,
follow:

she was indebted at the time she mar
ried Fair. Pence objected to the ques
tion, which brought the following ex
planation of its purpose from Mr. Ale-
E "\Ve e ciaim that she is not the widow
of the late James G. Fair and that her
testimony is an invention. She cannot
account for any money given her by Fair
and we claim he never gave her a cent,
but that on the contrary she lived on the
$250 a month salary she received as a
teacher in the San .Francisco School De
partment." ' .
A long line of questions as to how
Senator Fair knewWshe had returned
from the East in 1892 brought another
protest from Attorney Pence.
The Sausalito Ceremony.
"These questions are preliminary to the
Sausalito ceremony." replied Attorney
McEnerney. "We will not follow the for
tunes of the silk nightshirt this time."
Mrs. Craven-Fair then went on to tell
how the Sausalito affair occurred and the
circumstances which suggested it. Her
daughter Margaret had become very
much displeased at the contract affair
and it was in deference to her wishes
that the civil ceremony took place. She
said that she did not consider that it
made her any more Fair's wife than she
had been before.
"That is Just exactly what we have
been contending all along," was the tart
remark from Attorney Pierspn.
The witness went Into all the details
of the Sausalito trip, but the nearest she
could come to the date of it was between
July 10 and August 20. 1892. Strange as it
â¢may appear, neither she nor the Senator
met any one they knew on the day they
went across the bay. One man she re
membered to whom Fair had spoken on
that day was the proprietor of the
saloon or Inn where he went to Inquire
for Slmpton. She could not remember
his name, but has him located.
"The Senator told Slmpton he did not
want the marriage to be made public, but
wanted him to keep a record of it. which
he promised to do," continued the wit
ness.
At this stage of the proceedings the Fair
attorneys went off wrong. theSimpton let
ter and affidavit were produced and the
scene followed which has already been
described.
Wanted to Adopt Margaret.
Mrs. Craven-Fair said she had read the
"widow clause" in Fair's reputed Â«wtll.
but knew he had not written it. because
he had shown her from time to time
copies of all the wills Pierson had been
preparing for him and in none of them
was there such a provision. She told about
Reuben Lloyd offering her 1250,000 for a
quitclaim to the estate and later how Rus
sell, J. Wilson, on behalf of the children,
offered to compromise for $500,000. She
believed the children were sincere until
Judge Slack knocked out the trust clause
In the alleged will. After that they re
fused to negotiate with her. A provision
of all the proposed compromises was that
she was to be protected from all no
toriety.
She testified that upon one occasion
Fair wanted to adopt her daughter Mar
garet but for some reason not explained
he failed to do so. The petitioner's an
swers in the suit of Angus vs. Craven
were Introduced in evidence. These are
signed "Nettie R. Craven."

that was decidedly In favor of the woman
who claims to be the late millionaire's
widow.
"Without apparently knowing Just what
they were doing they asked Mrs. Craven-
Fair if she had any written evidence of
her alleged marriage' to Senator Fair.
They discovered when it was too late that
both the question and answer were load
ed. Of course she had written evidence,
and her features beamed with satisfac
tion when she said it. Mr. Pence, her at
torney, was keeping It for her. The Fair
counsel wanted to know more and they
Insisted upon the production of the evi
dence. That was just as easy as Mrs.
Craven-Fair's answer. Mr. Pence delved
into the depths of his pocket and out came
Justice Simpton's letter to W. W. Foote,
dated August 8, 1599, and the Marin
County .magistrate's affidavit, dated four
days later. Pence had been aching to pro
duce it and he nearly Jumped out of his
chair when the opposing counsel pre
sented the opening.
Fair Attorneys Disturbed.
Attorney Pierson. who has been con
ducting the cross-examination of the pe
tioner in the case, reached for the docu
ments. One glance seemed to convince
him that a mistake had been made some
where. He bit his lips and began a spell
of deep thinking. His reverie was dis
turbed by the rush of his associates all
eager to get a glance at Simpton's origi
nal declaration. Each made hasty mem
oranda of the statements that most in
terested him. There was a hurried con
sultation between the Fair forces, the ef
fusions of the Sausalito Justice were
handed to the clerk of the court and
marked for identification, and the learned
lawyers started an entirely new line of In
vestigation.
And Lafe Pence smiled, and smiled and
smiled.
Mrs. Craven-Fair was the only witness
on the stand during the day. She was a
little snappy at times and gave evidence
of a burning desire to tell Attorney Pier
son just what she thought of him In par-
shares to my brothers and sisters and to the
children of any deceased brother or sister by
right of representation. (The language of this
clause U taken from the Civil Code of the
State of California, section 1366, subdivision 3,
as it now exists, and shall bear the same con
struction as said subdivision of said section,
subject, however, to the provisions of paragraph
XVI of this will.) In case either of my daugh
ters file, leaving no children or descendants, the
one-fourth part of said trust property and es
tate herein directed to be transferred and con
veyed to her children or descendants shall be
transferred and conveyed to the children or
descendants of my other daughter; and if there
be none the game shall be transferred and
conveyed to my brothers and sisters and to
the children of any deceased brother or sister
by right of representation, as aforesaid.
"In trust, further, during the life or lives of
my said daughter and son. and the survivor of
them, to hold, manage and control the said
trust property and estate, and monthly to pay
over the not Income derived therefrom â¢to my
s-ald daughters and son in equal proportions;
and upon the death of either of my said daugh
ters to pay over the one- third of said net in
come to which she. if living, would be entitled,
to her children or descendants. If a.ny there be;
otherwise to my surviving daughter; and upon
the death, during the life cf my said son. of
raid surviving daughter, leaving children or
descendants, then to her eald children or de
scendants; and if she leave no children or de
scendants, then said portion of said net In
come to become a part of the rest and residue
of my estate, and to be disposed of as such
under the provisions of this will; and upon the
death of my said son to pay over the one-third
of said net income to which he. If living, would
be entitled to my two said daughters, in equal
proportions, or to the survivor of them."
Claims of the Litigants.
The ground upon which the Superior Court
held the trust created by the will to bÂ« Invalid,
and which Is maintained by the respondent
herein, is that it contravene* the provisions of
section Si 7, Civil Code. In thst It authorizes the
trustees, upon the death of the last surviving
child of the testator, to transfer and convey
the trust property to the persons therein desig
nated. The court further held that this trust
was po Inseparably connected with the other
wise valid trust to receive the Income of the
"property and apply the same to the use of the
children of the testator during their lifetime,
that,' In view of the legal consequences flowing
from its Invalidity, It could not be presumed
that the testator intended that the latter trust
should bÂ« effective. It therefore held that 'the
entire trust was Invalid and that the testator
had died Intestate as to real property described
In the complaint. The appellants concede that
a trust created merely for the purpose of con
veying real property to another Is unauthorized,
but claim that the provision In the will of
Senator Fair that upon the death of his last
surviving child the trustees Khali transfer and
convey the trust estate to the persons therein
designated, was not one of the "purposes" for
which he -created the trust; that the trust "cre
ated by the will is an executed trust; that .the
trustees have only an estate In the property
pur auter vie. which will terminate at "the
death of the last surviving child; that at the
death of the testator the persons to whom ha
directed the property to be transferred and
conveyed were vested with a remainder In his
estate which will vest In possession at the
death of his last surviving child, and that the
estate which will then be vested in them will
neither require nor admit a conveyance from the
trustees fcr the purpose of clothing them with
any Interest In the property.
Judgment of the Court.
It Is the opinion of the court, after view
ing the authorities presented, that the will does
not suspend the power cf alienation for a
longer period than during the lives of persons
In being at the death of the testator. The
fact that a child of either of the testator's
daughters, or of either of his brothers or sister*
may be en ventre sa mere at the death of his
last surviving child, will not have this effect.
Such fact cannot be Invoked to Impair the
validity of the will. It is only the power of
alienation which the statute forbids to be sus
pended, and this power Is not suspended by
reason of any difficulty or inconvenience ; that
may attend its exercise. â¢ The suspension of
alienation which Is aimed at by the . statute
is such as Is caused by the' lnstrument creat
ing the estate, and not such as naturally
arises from some disability on the part of the
person In whom the estate is vested, such as
Infancy or other incapacity, or from any other
cause outMde of the Instrument.
The provision in this section excluding from
determination In such action all questions con
cerning the validity of any devise or trust con
tained In a will or Instrument ' purporting to
be a will, which under the constitution "be
long exclusively to the probate Jurisdiction."
presents for construction the provision in -sec
tion 5 of article VI Â¦of the constitution, by
which the Superior Court Is given Jurisdiction
of all matters of probate, and what is- In
cluded under "matters of probate"; and to
what extent the Jurisdiction thus given to the
Superior Court is exclusive of the Jurisdiction
given to It hy the same section "In all- cases
in v equlty." These questions have not been dis
cussed by counsel, and. as the conclusion which
we have reached In reference to the validity
of the trust clause In the will necessitates a
reversal of the Judgment herein. It Is unneces
sary for uÂ« to determine whether the provisions
of iÂ«ection 735. as thus amended, were available
to the plaintiff for the purpose of maintaining
his action. We do not wiÂ»h to be understood
as expressing any opinion upon these points,
and allude to the matter only In order that
tt may not be Inferred from our silence thereon
that we hold the action to be authorized by
that section.
- The decree of distribution in the estate of
Fair Is reversed. The Judgment and order de
nying a new trial in the casÂ« of Fair vs. Angus
are also reversed. . . .
The theory of the Justices dissenting
from the above decision is contained In
the dissenting opinion written by Justice
Garoutte, which follows:

tice McFarland. Upon careful examination I
am satisfied It will be found that a very large

STATEMENT MADE TO W. W. FOOTE

Fair Attorneys Get a Document That Disconcerts Them.4455GERMANY AND GREAT BRITAIN.
DISPATCHES from Berlin announce that, not
withstanding the natural sympathy of the Ger
man people with the Boers, the trend of. public
opinion is distinctly in favor of the British. The
newspapers, which are supposed to speak for the Gov
ernment, have taken the lead in bringing about the
change of sentiment, and it is generally believed they
are largely inspired by the officials of the court, if
not by the Kaiser himself.
The argument used is not one which appeals to the
higher sentiments of the German people, but to their
â¢interests. Thus, for example, the Kreuz Zeitung is
reported to have given an elaborate review of reasons
why Germans do not like the British, but to have con
cluded by saying: "Notwithstanding this, England's
downfall would mean a distinct disadvantage to Ger
many in every part of the globe. Therefore it is no
part of German patriotism to uphold the cause of Eng
land's enemies."
Such statements go far to confirm the reports cir
culated at the time of the Kaiser's visit to London
shortly after the outbreak of the war, that an agree
ment had been reached by the two governments to
their mutual advantage. It was a case of give and
take. Large concessions were made to German rail
way interests in South Africa and British opposition
to the construction, under German control, of a rail
way from a Mediterranean port across Asia Minor to
a port on the Persian Gulf was withdrawn. The
British also gave up their interests in Samoa to the
Germans. What the Kaiser conceded in return for
these and perhaps other favors is not fully known,
but it seems clear he has promised Great Britain a
free hand in dealing >yith the Boers and is keeping
his word.
There are many reasons why the Germans and the
British should act together at this juncture and chief
among them is the growing power of Russia and her
alliance with France. Russia threatens Great Britain
in India and China, but she threatens Germany at
home. The financial and diplomatic arrangements,
by which the Russians get something very much like
domination over Persia, were aimed as much at the
Syrian interests of Germany as at the Indian interests
of Great Britain. It requires no great knowledge of
affairs to perceive that the famous concession for a
railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf
is worth very much less to the Germans now than it
was when.it promised to give them supremacy in
Persia. â¢ '

FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
ASSOCIATION TO
EXTEND ASIATIC
TRADE PROPOSED
Committee Has Been Ap
pointed to Call Meeting
of Trade Bodies.
Representatives of Houses Carrying
on Business With the Orient
Confer in Regard to the
Matter.
A meeting of San Francisco business
houses and transportation companies in
terested in the extension of trude with
the Orient met at the Chamber of Com
merce yesterday, George A. Newhall pre
siding. Among those present were: J. S.
Fearon of New York, James Otis, M. H.
McAllister, Morri3 Marcus, I. Steinhart,
Henry T. Scott, Joseph D. Grant, C. J.
King, R. P. Jennings, \V. R. Wheeler. H.
D. Loveland, Charles E. Miller, George D.
Cooper and John O. Blanchard.
Mr. Fearon is a member of the Ameri
can Asiatic Association of New York and
also of a business house at Shanghai.
China. The purpose of the meeting was
to discuss the feasibility of establishing
a Pacific Coast branch of the American
Asiatic Association, which Mr. Fearon
favored. One point, made was that the
association had a political as well as a
trade value. The open door to China, ha
paid, was largely due to the Influence of
the Asiatic Association.
W. R. Wheeler said that while he wa<i
favorable to anything that would tend to
increase the trade of San Francisco in the
Orient, it seemed to him, as he listened
to what had been said, that the Commer
cial Museum would be prepared to do all
it had been suggested the Asiatic Asso
ciation could perform.
Mr. McAllis'T reported facts concern
ing . the organization of associations else
where for the promotion of trade with the
Orient. He said London had a society
with 500 members, known aa the China
Association", composed of the most promi
nent bankers and merchants and finan
ciers in England, and- that they had
caused most of the improvements in the
treaties between Great Britain and China.
New York had the Asiatic Association
previously mentioned. An American As
sociation of China had also been formed
In Shanghai. Mr. McAllister suggested
that the Pacific Coast organization might
be called the Pacific Coast Branch of the
American Asiatic Association of New
York, or, if a separate organization
should be preferred, the name of the Pa
cfic Asiatic Association might do.
Mr. Newhall suggested the appointment
of a committee of five to consider the
formation of an Asiatic association in this
city, with power to call together the trade
bodies if they should think it advisable
to do so. He named as the committee
Henry T. Scott. Joseph D. Grant. M. H.
McAllister, R. P. Schwerin and George D.
Cooper. The meeting left further consid
eration of the subject to the committee
and adjourned.
A FORTIFIED CANAL.
IT is believed that the Hay-Pauncefote treaty will be
ratified by the Senate and that the way to the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal will be cleared
thereby.
A great many airy propositions have been made by
men expert in other things than statecraft. A civil
engineer proposes that we annex Nicaragua as an
American State in order to have the canal on our own
territory. This ranks with the British proposition to
take Delagoa Bay from the Portuguese. The pro
ponent of the scheme says that the present people in
power in Nicaragua would favor it, if they dared, but
that to do so would precipitate a revolution which
would put them out of power. This means that such
annexation would carry, with it a hostile and indignant
population, against which policy Blame so strongly
declared himself in his instructions to General Kil
patrick. To take Nicaragua would do more than this.
It would cut in two the system of South and Central
American governments. It would arouse suspicion
and solicitude in Mexico and would be held to justify
the fear expressed by the press and public men of that
republic that the' policy of the United States is to
subvert the independent governments now existing be
tween the Rio Grande and the Straits of Magellan. .
This suspicion is abroad in all the nations that
would be affected by that policy and has already ma
terially alienated from us the commercial sympathy
and trade of nearly sixty millions of people. This
process of alienation should not get impetus, either
from the annexation proposition or that to, fortify a
waterway which will thereby be rendered non-neutral.
We do not want the political company of the alien
races which people Central and South America, nor
do we want the treaty complications with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica which will be necessary if we secure
their consent to fortify on their soil. The measure of
their demands has already been taken in the terms of
the Frelinghuysen treaty, negotiated in the last days
of President Arthur's administration and withdrawn
by President Cleveland. That' treaty bound the
United States to defend the territorial integrity of
those two nations and thereby assumed for us an in
sufferable obligation, since it in effect obligated this
Government to furnish them a military establishment
at our cost/ to defend them in any complication in
which they might choose to embroil themselves. It
meant that we would haye to support them in any
Quixotic quarrel they might engage in and was prac
tically a standing and permanent declaration of wai
by the United States against any country to which our
little. proteges chose to offer battle. That they will
now accompany consent to fortify the 'canal on their
soil by like exactions, or others still more excessive,
there is no doubt.
This is foreseen by Admiral Dewey, who opposes
fortification because it will make the canal a battle
ground instead of a neutral highway for peaceful com
merce between the two oceans.
It will not be hard to effect, with the great com
mercial nations, the neutralization of a wide zone of
water at either terminus of the canal, and our navy
will find no difficulty in defending such zone and
thereby protecting the neutrality of the canal. If we
build and administer it. who can reach it except by
water? As its operation involves the use of locks,
what hostile fleet can get through it if the locks are
opened and emptied and made useless? "
In the extreme case of a foreign war,* which is
unlikely to come, we have means of defense involving
less cost and assuring greater safety than any fortifi
cation, or any treaty engagement with the Central
American States, made on the lines of the Freling
huysen convention.
The success which has attended the Mayor's literary
venture, which his Honor calls "Making Corporations
Pay Their Taxes," should spur him to another effort.
He is particularly well qualified to discuss "How to
Make Purchased Mayors Stay Bought, or Why. I Fell
Down." -: ;>i
ing 'that -"England's downfall would mean a distinct
disadvantage to Germany in every part of the globe."
The Kaiser has pushed his commercial expansion far
beyond the reach of his army to defend and his navy
is not yet strong enough. For the time being, at any
rate, it is necessary to his schemes that Great Britain
should remain powerful and successful. With the
passage of time there may come a shifting of interests
and then the British will have to look elsewhere for
allies. In the present crisis, however, it seems they
can rely on Germany to prevent the interference of
any other nation in the Boer war, for the Kaiser not
only appreciates the concessions given him but has
a forward look to favors yet to come.

THE FIGHT FOR MORALITY.
WHEN next the attorneys for the racetrack
jamblers and the proprietors of the downtown
poolrooms appeal to the Supervisors for a li
cense for their operations they will not venture to
assert, as they did last week, that the silence of the
press and the people gave consent to the project.
The Call has spoken for the press and the pulpit has
spoken for the public and once more the forces that
defeated the gamblers a year ago are united to with
stand the new assault.
The sermons preached on Sunday against a renewal
of track gambling were notably strong. They came
from some of the foremost pastors of the city, repre
senting nearly all denominations of religious faith, for
on an issue of this kind, plainly affecting public mor
ality, there are no differences of sentiment among
good men. Such sermons can hardly fail to have a
deep and far-reaching influence among all classes of
respectable people and from this time on we may ex
pect the new content against the gamblers to be waged
as earnestly as was the crusade that broke their power
2. year ago.
The Rev. E. Nelander of the First English Lutheran
Church described Ingleside track-gambling as "a putrid
sore on the body politic." A business that brings no re
turn or profit to the community, for "the poolseller
gives nothing for that which he takes but anguish and
shame and woe." The Rev. E. A. Woods of the First
Kaptist Church said: "The officers of our city govern
ment received the votes of men of different parties
with the pledge that under the new charter we should
have good government and that the wishes of the peo
ple should be respected. We were promised a new-
San Francisco and surely the. licensing of these crime
breeding resorts is not a step upward."
The Rev. T. Caraher of St. Francis Church said:
"During the past year I have met a number of unfor
tunates who have lost home and property through
playing the races and I have also known deluded
parents who foolishly expended their savings and their
earnings- in the betting ring, leaving their children to
futfFer for life's necessities. Our young women arc
:cd to ruin by the poolroom system and this should
l>e prevented in future by curtailing that evil power."
The Rev. Philip Coombe of Richmond Congregational
Church said: "Scarcely* anything could occur that
*ould be more injurious to healthful growth, more
ruinous to business integrity, more degenerating to
public morals, more defiant to good sentiment, more
offensive to official trust than this."
Rev. John A. B. Wilson of Howard-street Methodist
Kp:Â«copal Church, after expressing surprise that the
question of renewing the license of the gamblers
should have arisen, asked: "Are there not already a
sufficient ntimber of men in San Quentin as a result
of this iniquity? Are there not enough women lead
ing nameless lives who were led down by one or the
other of these evils?" Rev. W. E. Dugan of the Stew
art Memorial Presbyterian Church said: "Let our Su
pervisors remember that to reopen the Ingleside track
mean? that every inch of it will be paved with wrecked
characters, blasted hopes and ruined homes and ce
mented by human blood." Rev. John Hemphill â¢of
Calvary Presbyterian Church said: "Open the race
track, we are told, and it will attract people to our city
who will spend money with a free hand. So does the
rsrrion attract the buzzard, but we wish neither buz
zard nor carrion."
The Rev. Dr. Hutsinpiller of the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church summed up the argument by say
ing: "Granting that men must have recreation and
some sport, no sensible man is willing to concede that
what has proved a nuisance in the past and was closed
because of its bad effects upon the morals and the
manhood of the city â yes, and the womanhood, too â no
clear-brained msn, I say. is ready to concede that the
Board of Supervisors of our city can open again this
avenue to gambling and wastefulness."
From these words, uttered by persons speaking with
the responsibility and with the authority of pastors of
the people, the Supervisors, who may have been in
clined to favor the gamblers, may learn a profitable
Vsson. San Francisco is not giving tacit ennernt to
lier own shame and the ruinof numbers of her people.
She has uttered her protest and it behooves her
officials to heed it

ONLY TWO WEEKS' PAY
FOR SICK ABSENTEES
C?ivil Service Order That Has Caused
Consternation in Federal
Circles.
Port Collector Jackson has been noti
fied by the Treasury Department that
hereafter employes in that branch of the
service will not be allowed pay when off
duty on account of sickness for more
than fourteen days In any one calendar
year, without- permission of the depart
ment. The notification was productive of
much dissatisfaction and adverse com
ment In the. Custom-house. Heretofore
each employe had been allowed fourteen
days' vacation in each year with full pay,
and in case of sickness pay for not ex
ceeding thirty days.
.The Treasury Department has found
that frequent absences of employes under
plea of sickness have embarrassed the
public service, and that political consider
ations have been very often brought to
bear upon collectors to grant extended
absences from duty under full pay when
oftentimes such absences were not neces
sary.

THE GOLDEN GATEâ A Subscriber,
City. "The Golden Gate" is applied to th&
entrance from the Pacific Ocean to the
bay of San Francisco and not to an imag
inary line from one point to another. It
lies In latitude 37 degrees 48 minutes north,
and longitude 122 degrees and 30 minutes
west from Greenwich. The entrance is a
strait about five miles long with an aver
age width of one and a half miles. The
name Chrysopaloe or Golden Gate first ap
pears In the "Geographical Memoirs of
California" and relative map published by
Colonel John C. Fremont In the early part
of IS4S. Many are under the impression
that the name was applied to the strait
because gold was discovered In California
and that as In those days the strait was
the principal avenue of entrance to the
State, which was designated as thÂ« Golden
State, it was called the Golden Gate, but
it was descriptive, not of the literal golden
regions within, then as yet undiscovered,
but merely of the rich and fertile country
which surrounded the shores of the bay,
and of the wealth of the commerce of the
Pacific, passing through the strait Trould
certainly give to the future great city of
the place. The name was probably sug
gested by the Golden Horn of Constanti
nople.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,; TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1900.
PARTY DIVISION.
THE CALL recently advised that there be" little or
no legislation at t this session of Congress for
our new possessions. This advice was given be
cause opinion on that subject in the Republican party
is neither crystallized nor unanimous. The issue has
not been profoundly examined. The facts in the case
are not yet widely known. A legislative- policy
adopted now has no assurance of being right as a
permanency. It has no assurance in our present state
of knowledge of being adapted to the situation with
which it will deal The Bryan Democracy, stand
ing in opposition, has exhibited all the features of an
opportunism which may do harm. A few months ago
its organs were loudly demanding that the flag be
"nailed to the Philippines" and that the government
of those islands be non-constitutional. Now they are
as brazenly demanding that the constitution be in
all respects extended to the same Philippines and
Porto Rico as well !
There are supreme difficulties, turn which way Con
gress will. As we foresaw, the first attempt at legis
lation, in the case of Porto Rico, has developed a di
vision of sentiment in the Republican party which
destroys the integrity of its majority in the House.
The Bryan Democracy in that body promptly de
serts the position of its organs, which demanded
non-constitutional government, and lines up for ex
tension of the constitution to all these posses
sions. This is in line with their opportunism.
They are lacking in that sincerity which originates
in principles and convictions. They are now denounc
ing President McKinley for nailing the flag to the
Philippines and taking Porto Rico, both of which
acts they were demanding eighteen months, ago.
Had he taken neither they would be denouncing him
now for the omission. Faced by such an opposition,
it behooves the Republican party to digest its policy
at leisure and finally so found it on immovable prin
ciples and known facts as to avoid such divisions is
that led last week by Littlefield of Maine and promptly
supported in the House by the Democratic minority.
A year and a half ago the Bryan Democratic press
was pointing with pride to the imperial policy of Great
Britain as worthy of our imitation. They were prais
ingthe democratic freedom of the civil institutions of
England. Now they are denouncing everything Eng
lish as stoutly and profanely as did old Petrnus Stuy
vesant, Governor of New Amsterdam, who carried it
to the extent of chopping down the English cherry
trees which grew in front of hfs house. There
is no doubt at all that if this administration should be
involved in a warlike controversy with Great Britain
these same organs and leaders would immediately
change again and become hysterically pro-British.
They learned the habit during our civil war. When
we took Mason and Slidell, the Confederate envoys,
from the deck of a British ship, they attacked Lin
coln and Seward for insulting England. And, when
after mature consideration, we. surrendered the two
Confederates to England, they attacked Lincoln for
what they called "a cowardly surrender."
Faced by such an unstable and unprincipled opposi
tion, Republican leaders must see that their duty is to
profoundly study the new and afflicting problems
which have come out of the Pandora's box of the
Spanish war and not proceed until the}' are sure of
the right policy on lines that will keep the party intact.
When we advised this course recently we did not
expect as prompt an object lesson as is furnished by
the situation developed in the House last week. Sup
pose that the division led by Mr. Littlefield shall, by
alliance with the Bryan minority in both branches of
Congress, succeed in securing free trade, throughout
the campaign the labor vote of this country will be
besieged and besought to defeat the Republican party
because it has been forced to competition with a
tropical wage of 25 cents a day.
The country, right or wrong, holds the party in
power responsible for government and for a great
many things th.it government cannot do. It will be
weak and useless therefore to answer this persuasion
of the labor vote by charging the situation to . the
minority. Their answer is ready. It will be: "You
had a majority in both houses of Congress What
they did is what you consented should be done."
And the Republican answer can be only a confession
of the division of sentiment in the Republican party
and therefore a confession of its inefficiency.

Heat Changes in Compression and
Expansion.
Everybody who has ever pumped ap a
bicycle tire with a hand pump knows
that the compressed air is hot. The work
done upon the air by the pumping in

temperature. If the air thos compressed

atmospheric temperature before It Is re
!e JV?*w' the lssui DX Jet of expanding air
will be felt to be distinctly cold. This
Is the action upon which the modern "re
generative method" is based.
The Regenerative method.
This method is used on a considerable
scale, chiefly by three experimentersâ
Linde in Germany, Hampsin in England
and Tripler in America. As Tripler's ope
rations seem to be the most extensive, as
well as the most interesting to us for
other reasons, his method ' will be de
scribed bo far as it is publicly known. It
is almost absurdly simple. There Is an
air compressor operated by steam power,
colls In which the compressed air Is cooled
to the temoerature of the water run
ning over them, and a "llquefler," as It
Is called, from which liquid air Is drawn
by the gallon when the plant is in ope
ration.
The air Is compressed three times, with
cooling between; first, to about sixty
pounds above the atmospheric pressure
then to about 400 pounds, and last to SOO
pounds to the square inch. The dust is
filtered from the air before it enters the
compressor and there is another separa
tion at the highast pressure to take out
the last traces of foreign matter. The
air Is at 2500 pounds pressure and at tha
temperature of the cooling tanks then
passes to the- liqu<Â»fiers, of which there
are two. Just what the construction of
the liqueflers Is is not publicly known.
Their essential parts are a long coil of
copper tube surrounded by a cylinder
which is thoroughly wrapped in Insulat
ing material. The compressed air passes
through the copper tube and Is released
at the end by means of a needle valve,
said to be of some particularly advanta
geous design. At this point It expands to
about the atmospheric pressure, and is
very greatly cooled in the process. This
expanded and cooled air then passes back
ward over the colls of pipe and escapes,
cooling the compressed air within, which.
In its turn, expands at the valve and ts
still further cooled. The process Is, there
fore, progressive and cumulative in its
coolin? effect, and the lowering of tem
perature at the release point soon be
comes so great that part of the air lique
fies and collects In the lower end of the
liqueflers, from which it can be drawn oft
like so much water by opening a tap.
Not the least wonderful thing about it
is that this liquid air. at a temperature

adequate conception, ts handled In appar
ently the most careless fashion without

, ll Vv Agnes Jollymour dashed out
if;/* of the store of P. W. Wobber,
1545 Park street, this afternoon,
creating great excitement on Ala
meda's main thoroughfare. The
flames were quickly extinguished,
but the young lady was so badly
burned that she cannot recover.
The fire was caused by the explo
sion of a can of gasoline and Miss
Jollymour, who remained conscious
throughout her suffering, was able to
make a statement as to the manner
of the accident to the physicians who
attended her. She said she went into
the shed in the rear of the Wobber
store, where the illuminating oils are
kept, for the purpose of filling a can.
with gasoline. The shed was dimly
lighted by a small coal oil lamp, but
Miss Jollymour did not notice its
proximity to the gasoline.
She had Just begun to pour the
gasoline when it exploded. In an
instant she was enveloped in flames
and ran screaming into the street.
George Foster of Foster & Son, con

mind his own business. Smith replied that
was Just what he was doing and showed
his badge. .Thereupon Deeley Sobbed
him by the collar and dragged him to the
patrol box. Smith wanted to know what
he was arrested for and Deeley replied
"for Interfering with an officer."
Smith was taken -to the City Prison
and after being booked gave $20 cash bail
for his release. He said that Deeley had
used vulgar language toward him. Alter
he had been released from prison he saw
the horse being taken to Westphal s sta
bles and when he asked Deeley again
who the owner was Deeley threatened to
again arrest him. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦"Â¦ . .
After disposing of Smith Deeley had re
turned to the trench to extricate the
horse and Caleb A. Ensign, inspector for
the Electric Light Company, who had as
sisted In dragging the animal out during
Deeley's absence, asked him 'if he knew
the owner. Deeley at once became abusive
and arrested Ensign on the charge of in
terfering with an. officer. C. VV e â¢Â»on;,Â» on ;,
years old, and an old veteran of the Civil
\Var, who resides at the Yountville home,
happened to be near Ensign at the time
and Deeley grabbed hold of him and
threw him down. The old man weakly
protested and Deeley promptly placed him
under arrest for interfering with an offi

Prison. Ensign, gave cash bail, but the
poor old man was unable to do so ana
was detained in prison. *
Smith, accompanied by Secretary Hol
brook of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, made a formal com
plaint against Deeley to Chief of Police
Sullivan and Deeley was sent for. Smith
had the names of several witnesses who
would testify to hearing the abusive lan

Deeley denied that he was under the

DETJXrEME LECON.â LESSON 2.
Hints on Pronunciation.
1. The student has seen in the preced
ing lesson.that many letters of the French
alphabet are like the English. The chief
difficulty of the French pronunciation is
confined to the sounds v. eu and the
nasals. It would therefore seem best to
familiarize oneself with these vowels as
soon as possible. To effect this success
fully they should be gone over and re
hearsed dally for some time, first singlyâ
viz., v, eu, an, in, on, un, and then united
â¢to the other letters, using for that pur
pose the words of the exercises and
phrases that will appear In the lesson
viz., lundi. mercredl, printemps, jeudl,
deux, premier, dernier, etc.; lung-dee,
mair-cre-dee, prang-tong, juh-dee, duh,
prem-ee-ay, dare-nee-ay.
2. Amonsr the consonants are two requir
ing special attention, soft g and J. which
ought both to be pronounced Hko z In
azure; the soft g is always followed by i
or c, otherwise It Is hard.
3. The final s is generally mute in
French; it is blended with the following
vowel, then it sounds like z. See lesson v,
4. There are three accents in French!.
(1) Aigu, ay-gu ('). a mark from the right
to the left over c, as etc; (2) grave, grahv
("), a mark from the left to the right over
the letters a, c, v (a. c, v). as pere; (3)
circonflexe, ceer-kohn-flex ("*>, a double
mark composed of the former two, over
the letters a, c, 1. o. v (a, c, !. 0, 0). as
1 tete.
6. Another important mark is the so
called "c6dllle.' r say-dee-y (,). which is
placed under tha c (c.) before the vowels
a. o, v. thus making the sound of c like
that of sâ viz., rec.u. re-suh. No cedllle is
required before 1 or c.
6. The "tralt-d" union" mark, tral-doon
yon (-) connects one word, syllable or
letter with anotherâ viz. :
Voulez-vous me dormer un timbre-poste?
Voo-lay voo muh don-nay un-tang-br
poh-st?
Will you give me a stamp?

SOME ERRORS
DISCOVERED IN
SHEEHAN'S BOOKS
Former Tax Collector Will
Be Called Upon to Ex
plain Them. :
Neglect to Mark Collections Paid for
Which Property Owners Hold Re
ceipts May Cause Serious
Complications.
Grave errors were discovered* yesterday
in the records left by ex-Tax Collector
Sheehan which will certainly require an
explanation from that former public of
ficial. While Tax Collector Scott is in
clined to the opinion that the errors were
merely clerical it Is quite likely that
Sheehan will be called upon to deposit a
sum equal to the amount Involved In the
case. V-, ; ;-
The errors consisted In the failure of
Sheehan's deputies to stamp as paid two
amounts for which the owners of certain
properties hold receipts, showing that the
taxes had been collected during Sheehan's
administration. . While William Rodgers,
a clerk employed by Simpson & Millar,
searchers of records, was making ab
stracts of property owned by Slgmund
Greenbaum he discovered that a piece of
land at the southeast corner of Van Ness
avenue and Chestnut street, assessed at
$4500, had been marked delinquent on the
first Installment and a penalty of $5 51
added. Rodgers reported the matter to
Mr. Greenbaum, who at once produced a
receipted bill signed by M. T. Sullivan,
who was cashier in the office under Shee
han, showing that $3G 68 had been paid
for the first installment on November 25,
1599. There was no entry of payment in
the volume of the assessment roll against,
this piece of property, although a piece
entered directly above had been marked
paid on the same date as the taxes on
the first piece had been collected.
A peculiar circumstance in this con
nection Is that the amount $36 68 was en
tered In the cash book on the date men
tioned. A lead pencil check mark, how
ever, had been erased, but not complete
ly, and this further complicates the situa
tion.
No sooner had this error been discovered
than another was found concerning apiece
of property assessed to E. M. Heaton et
al. for $400, being lot 5 In West End map
No. 2. The first Installment of $3 26 Is
not marked paid in the office records,
but Heaton has in his possession a re
ceipted bill showing that he paid the tax
on November 27, 1899. In this case, how
ever, the payment can not be located In
the cash book In the tax office on that
date. This makes It evident that the
money never reached the city treasury
unless the payment was credited on an
other date, which will be difficult to as
certain.
Whether any more such omiwlons have
occurred through careless or worse meth
ods will not be known until the tax-pay
ers present themselves to pay their second
Installments or have their receipted bills
verified. The present Tax Collector de
clines to mark the .two payments referred
to In his books as paid merely on the pro
duction of the signed bills. It may neces
sitate that the payment be made a sec
ond time and the tax-payer must then
look to the Board of Supervisors for the
return of the duplicate payment. At any
rate, serious complications are liable to
ensue should the property be sold to the
State fof the taxes and - the property
owner, discovering it, should then pro
duce his receipted bill for the taxes paid.

Slayer of Charles Joyce Is Given His
Liberty.
Ex-Policeman Thomas H. Dillon, who
shot and killed Charles Joyce, grocer at
Seventeenth and Castro streets on Janu
ary 15, is a free man, Judge Conlan having
dismissed the case against him yesterday.
In rendering his decision the Judge said
It was a most unusual case, as most of
the witnesses for the prosecution might

defense. Two of them, Charles Taylor and
Pye George, had testified that Joyce had
fired twice at Dillon before the latter re
turned the fire, and it was a clear case of
self-defense.
HERMANN-STREET TOUGHS.
Warrants Out for the Arrest of the
Gang's Leaders.
Mrs. Kate Strobel, 622 Hermann Btreet,
secured "John Doe" warrants in Judge
Fritz's court yesterday, for the arrest of
three hoodlums who have been making
her life miserable. The only charge that
could be made against them was for dis
turbing the peace. ' '
The three defendants are the leaders of
what is known as the Hermann-street
gang of hoodlums. They have terrorized
the residents on that and neighboring
streets, and Policeman C. M. Barnes has
been detailed to break up the gang.
Sunday night they congregated in front
of Mrs. Strobel' s house and raised such
a disturbance that she remonstrated,
whereupon they used vulgar language and
began firing snots from revolvers at the
side of the house. One of the bullets nar
rowly missed her. ,
After they left they went to the resi
dence of Mrs. Feldhauser. 119 Oermania
street, and fired several shots through the
woodwork.

he turned his face westward and came to California. He did not remain long,
however, but when he returned In IS6B he came for good. He became Identi
fied with the Democratic party of the State soon after his arrival here and for
aIU the years he has lived In California he has always been known as a
stanch and willing worker in the cause of the Democracy. He was a ready
and forceful speaker and In every campaign his voice has been raised In
support and defense of the party to which he was so loyal. The military in
etinct Â¦ remained with . him and found satisfaction in 1876, when he was made
adjutant general of the National Guard of California under Governor Irwin.
He served in that office until 1880. In ; 1884 he .was made; registrar of voters
for San": Francisco under Governor Btoneman and this office he held until 18S7.
In 1894 he was appointed United States Pension Agent for San Francisco. He
retired from the office in 1898.

Critical Temperature,
Of the substances familiar to every
body, some occur, under ordinary condi
tions, In the three states of gas, liquid
and solid. Water, for example, under the
usual pressure of the atmosphere, passes
into steam at 100 degrees centigrade or
212 degrees Fahrenheit, and freezes at 0
degrees centigTade or 32 degrees Fahren
heit. If the pressure Is increased the
boiling point rises, and if the pressure is
-lowered the boiling point falls accordlng
ly> The pressure and thÂ« temperature
must both be taken into account. If the
temperature Is kept high, as In a steam
boiler, a greater pressure must be exerted
to maintain the water in the liquid state
and if the ordinary temperature were, on
the average. 400 degrees centigrade higher
than it is water would be known to us
only as a gas.
The researches of Andrews showed
clearly that a similar state of things ex
ists for every substance. That Is, there
is for every substance some point of tem
perature above which it cannot become
liquid, and this temperature is called the
"critical temperature." His most In
structive experiments were made with
"carbonic acid gas," or carbon dioxide,
wmen nas a critical temperature easily
reached. The nrst step, then, in the
liquefaction of any gas must evidently be
to reduce Its ' temperature below the crit
ical point. Then, and not before then,
will pressure become effective in reducing
It to a liquid. Evidently, also, any gas
will be easy or difficult to liquefy accord-
Ing as Its critical temperature is high or
low. Oxygen, whose critical temperature
is 118 degrees below zero, centigrade, re
sisted all efforts at liquefaction for many
years; nitrogen, with a critical tempera
ture of â146 degrees centigrade, was still
more refractory, and hydrogen, whose
critical temperature has not been exactly
determined, had to be cooled to about 233
degrees or more below the zero of the
centigrade scale before it yielded.
The attainment of these extremely low
temperatures was a matter of great diffi
culty and was accomplished only gradu
ally through years of experiment. The
means upon which chief reliance has been
placed until recently Is the heat change
occurring when a substance which melts
or boils at a low temperature is allowed
to change from the solid to the liquid or
from the liquid to the gaseous state.
Heat Changes in Melting and Boiling
When a solid is melted beat must be
continually supplied to It until the melt-
Ing Is completed. This heat is used In
doing the work of separating the particles
from the close bonds which make it a
solid. It produces no change In tempera
ture* and Is therefore called -"latent"
heat. The use of Ice In drinking water Is
a common illustration of this action, or
the freezing of Icecream by the melting
cf a mixture of Ice and $alt In the lat
ter case part of the necessary beat Is sup
plied tÂ« the melting mixture by the cream
which is frozen, the freezing point ot the
cream being higher than the melting
point of the mixture. â¢;Â¦
Similarly, when a liquid Is changed to
a gas, a steady supply of heat is neces
sary, much greater than Is needed to melt
the same quantity of the substance. It
Is possible to evaporate water so rapidly
under a reduced jjressure that the water
Itself is frozen. The heat Is used in work
at a rapid rate and is taken from the body
of water which is evaporating. . Small
portions of substance* which are usually
gaseous have been solidified In this way.
By means of this action, and by a
proper choice of substances, very low
temperatures have been produced. The
method is still used . and must continue
to be. In the past it has been an expen
sive method because the substances which

LUMBER FRAUD WILL
NEVER BE EXPLAINED
Defective Indictment Prevents a
Judgment as to the Guilt or In
nocence of Burns, O'Brien
and Swift.
Ex-School Director T. A. Burns, ex-In
spector of Buildings J. J. O'Brien and
Edward D. Swift, lumber merchant, were
dismissed from custody by Judge Cook
yesterday after several days had been ex
pended In an effort to convict them of de
frauding the city out of $5000 on alleged
fraudulent transactions In connection
with the School Department.
Several days ago defendants* counsel
moved for the dismissal of the defendants
on the ground that there was a material
variance between the wording of the In
dictment upon which they were tw.lng
prosecuted and the contract upon which
the indictment was framed. After
lengthy argument Judge Cook took the
matter under advisement and the trial
was continued. Yesterday Judge Cook
found that the point urged in favor of de
fendants was well taken and instructed
the jury to acquit the defendants. The
Jury followed instructions and the ac
cused went forth purged of the charge
against them.
the Wobber store. Miss. Jollymour
ran to him, putting her hands- upon
his shoulders. Foster told the girl
to lie down In order that he and
others who came to his assistance
might have a better chance to stamp
out the fire. She refused to obey
and wae finally thrown to the ground.
The flames were not easily subdued,
but finally Foster procured a bucket,
filled It with water from a barrel
used by plasterers, and threw It upon
the suffering girl.
Miss M. M. Smith, whose father is
engaged In the tea business next to
the Wobber store, saw Miss Jolly
mour run into the street and held her
In her arms while the flames were
being quenched. Her own clothing
was slightly scorched.
Miss Jollymour was removed to the
home of her mother, 1130 Park
avenue, where all that could be done
was performed by kind hands. The
physicians In attendance think there
Is small hope for her recovery. Over
one-half of her body Is horribly
burned, particularly about the abdo
men. In her efforts to .beat the
flames away her hands were also
burned.
"When Miss Jollymour came run
ning out of the store," said Miss
Smith," she was a mass of fire from
the ground to her chest. I ran to
her assistance and after she had been
forced to the walk, held her in my
arms. I screamed to the men not to
use any water, but they found they
could not get the flames out with
their hands and so dashed It upon
her."
"There was nothing else to do but
use the water," said George Foster.
"We tried to stamp the fire out, but
It seemed to be getting worse. I
know that water Is not considered a
good thing to use, but I had rather
use some of It than see the whole
body scorched with burns."
Once before in her life Miss Jolly
mour had been a victim of fire. When
she was 10 years old her clothing
caught fire from a grate . and she
came near being burned to death.

Dr. W. S. Rice, the Weil-Known
Authority, Sends a Trial of His
Famous Method Free to All.
Out of the chaos of old-time failure comes a
new and ctartlln? cure for rupture. Dr. W. S.
Rice, 122 N. Main st.; Adams, N. V., has in-
MX. CHAi . LA GÂ£.
vented a method that cures without pain, dan-
ger, operation or an hour's loss of time from
the day's work. To avoid all questions of
doubt he sends free to every suiTerer a free
trial of his method and there can bÂ« no earthly-
reason why any one, rich or poor, should not
B vail themselves of this generous offer. As
an instance of this remarkable method, the
cure of Charles Lange, Morrison, 111., is a
welcome piece of intelligence.
Mr. Lenge is a well preserved old gentleman.
72 years cf age and for. eighteen years had a
bad double rupture which no treatment could
cope with. After a short use of the Rice
method the left rupture healed entirely and
the right was almost closed in a few weeks.
To-day he is as sound aa a dollar, wears no
truss or other support and his cure is only one
of hundreds of similar cases reported by those
who use the Rice method. Send for this free
trial. Don't be backward. It will suprlse you
with its wonderful power to heal. And if you
know of other ruptured people ask them to
write or write for them. Do not fall to write
at once: do so to-day.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â T0-day's state
ment of the condition of the treasury shows:
THE STOCK MARKET.
EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 26.â The most Â¦ notable
feature cf to-day's feverish and excited stock
market was the fact that the railroad depart
ment apparently succeeded in breaking away
from the Influence of the Industrials and
ppedaltlea and in differentiating the undeniable
elements of strength in that department from
the demoralization and weakness in the other.
The railroads succumbed in the early dealings
to the sympathetic influence of the violent de
clines among the industrials, but during the
day a confident demand sprang up for a num
ber of railroad stocks which lifted the whole
level of that department materially above.
Â£atcrfiay*s close. Bo far as the day's news
went it ebrd little light on the excited weak
ness of a number of industrials. The move
ment on the appearance is a sort of a duel
en the part of the contending interests and
there are circumstances tending to confirm
this explanation of the movement. A report
finds credence that the long interests of the
Third Avenue deal are thriftily availing them-
K>iv(Â» cf the unsettling effect of the weakness
in this Frock to make a bear turn in other
etocks. That bitter animosities and rivalries
are Involved is also a current Tumor in. the
etreet. the same potential entitles coming into
play as during the panic of last December.
The battle rared most fiercely about the stocks
of the New York public utilities for the cen
tralized control of which a long-standing con
test has been waged. The notorious financial
difficulties of Third Avenue played a continu
ing part to-day and there was added to this
rumors that the companies would be severely
dealt with in the approaching application of
the new State" franchise taxation law. The
extreme declines in the New York traction
t nfl gas stocks ran from 2 to 9 points,
the latter in Third Avenue. Sugar was an
other storm-center, the furious speculation in
that stock hinging upon the doubts regarding
the next quarterly dividend, action upon which
is imminent. A reduction In the existing rate
Is taken for granted, but opinion differs as
to the amount of the reduction, extending all
the way to the total suspension. Sugar's total
fall was T\. and It closed practically at
the lowest. Tennessee Coal and the Tobacco
rtocks also showed notable weakness. Except
in Sugar there were violent rallies from time
to time, reflating the demand from the bears
to cover shorts. The strength of the railroad
stocks was based upon the substantial ground
of increased earnings. A large number of re
turns were made during the day, all showing
very striking gains over the corresponding
j*riod of last year. For the last week in Feb
ruary the most notable examples were Norfolk
and Western. Ontario and W ef tern, Louisville
and Nashville and Chicago, Indianapolis and
Louisville. For January a sharp .showing of
net earnings was made on Wabash, C. and E.
I. and Hocking Valley. Saturday's weak bank
statement had Â»erne continued effect in the
early dealing*, but there is an impression held
in speculative circles that some part of the
recent large expansion of loans is designed for
future u*e in the stock market. Sterling ex
change was weak on Increased offerings of
rail bills. The actual rate for demand sterling
declined *Â¦; and for long sterling 4 per cent.
The bond market was rather dull and Ir
regular. Total pales, par value, $1.550,000.
ITnited States bonds were buoyant under the
Influence nt the tefunling bill now in con
jerence. The rew 4s and old 4s "coupon) ad
vanced 14 and old 4m (registered) and 3s and

STUDENTS HONOR
PROF. LE CONTE
ON HIS BIRTHDAY
Seventy-Seventh Anniver
sary Is Made Notable at
the University.
The Aged Professor Happily Be
sponds to the Warm Greetings
of His Many Friends
and His Classes.
BERKELEY. Feb. 26.â The seventy
seventh birthday of Professor Joseph Le
Conte of the University of California was
celebrated to-day by the students and
friends of the professor. His lecture room
was decorated with violets and palms
and crowded with students. An engrav
ing of "The Prophets" was presented on
behalf of the student body by President
FredDorety of the Associated Students.
Dr. Le Conte responded to the students
and said that every good thought which
he has ever had has come to him while
he was lecturing or preparing to lecture,
and that every scientific or phillsophical
article that he has ever written has
sprung from some germinated thought
which was first r* all given forth in the
classroom.
"I have tried," said he, "to give you the
true spirit of science, and, more than
that, the true spirit of learning. You said
to me that every year I am growing five
years younger. I sometime:* feel as if
that were really true, for my sympathy
with young people continually Increases,
anoVI look on youth with reverence."
ACTOR DENMAN
THOMPSON, HIS
PLAY AND ART
Typically American Drama
With All the Elements
of Popularity. Â¦
Dearth of New Attractions This
Week â The Alcazar an Excep
tion With Clay Greene's
"The New South."
"Art" cannot bÂ« applied to the acting
cf Der.man Thompson except In the coi
leqiilsl abuse of the word, and "drania"
cannot be applied to "The Old Homj-
Ftead" at all. It is not a play. It amust-s,
however, yea mightily, as the chortling
audience that always goes with it testi-
The entertainment (for want of a bet
ter term) is dear to the American heart
that large, healthy, cordial, good-natured,
nupid heart that beats time to slushy
eentimtnt In every form from the theat
rical- victories of virtue to the vaudevll
lanous "mother-song."
."The Old Homestead" is not a play, rie-
Fj-ite its undercurrent plot, any more
than three clubs and two spades are a
full hand. It has no more claim to litrr
ary consideration than Will Carltoti's
"poetry." with which class of productions
it is strictly analogous. This "entertain
ment" in tive acts is no more than a vehi
cle for one long, wide character â that of
Josh Whltcomb, a sort of tawdry frame
for a clever caricature.
The talk of faithfulness in Denman
Thompson's limning of the character; the
truthful presentation of a type, is simply
Filly. Without exaggeration s artful aid
there would be nothing to Uncle Josh.
not even his boots. As with the Greek
column that Is made convex in order that
it may appear straight; as with the
blotches of black in a Japanese print that
make the central design more luminous.
fo Desman Thompson's large splashes of
impossibility in his characterization aim
to endow it with distinctness.
He goes very much farther than is nec
pfÂ«arv, however, and misses even the
pembfance of faithfulness: but I am not
prepared to pay that he sacrifices truth
to his appetite for applause. He simply
elves his auditors what they demand â
large, chunks of hayseed humor, which
enjoys them much.
Laughter and applause go vrith every
line of "The Old Homestead," in the face
of which criticism seems idle. There are
thope whom it does not move to smiles,
rnucn less the palmy impact and the
tumult of the 6o!e; but these are in the
minority and don't count. They certain
ly cannot hinder the success of "The Old
Homestead." for that Is a tradition as

Alcazar.
"The New South" was the attraction at
the Alcazar last night, and it was greeted
with the usually well filled first night
house, and with the usually warm
} â¢ arted audience. Mary Hampton and
Krnest Hastings carried off the applauso
cf the piece, it being r.o more than poetic
justice that they should, as they were the
hf-ro and heroine, and brave Captain
Harry Ford and big-hearted Georgia
Gwynne were very much in love with
each other. They were called before the
curtain five times at the close of the first
act, four times after the second act and
presented with violets, and again after
the third act to receive the enthusiastic
applause of a well-pleased audience. Jef

and Mlfis Laura Crews as Bessie Fessen

laughter at the amusing episodes with

interspersed.

demands were not acceded to. *
Clerk of the Court of Appeals Shackel

the Democratic officials injunction suits
were filed by - each of the new officials,

The amateur concert which was given
in the Maple room of the Palace Hotel'
last evening for the benefit of the San
Francisco Seaman's Church and Insti

was a real success both financially and
socially.
The Maple room was crowded to Its ut
most capacity. by the city's elite, who en
joyed some really excellent amateur con
cert work and incidentally helped along
irrespective of sectarian affiliations two
charities- that are doing untold good
among the men who go down to the sea
in ships.
The admission was $2 DO, but It was eas
ily within the reach of the class that con
tributed to both the audience and the
performers, and the crowd that gathered
Justified the expectations that were raised
when it was known that the following
well known ladies had consented to act as
patronesses and lend their influence to

IL Taylor, Mrs. Tobin, Mrs. Irwln, Mrs.

KEEP YOUR BLOOD CLEAR
REV. L. J. GARVER, Who Has Scandalized Haywards.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â Rev. Leonard J. Garver, who dispenses theology to
residents of Hayward3 through the Haywards Congregational Church,
of which he Is pastor, did a cakewalk a few evenings ago, and now
the Congregational denomination is stirred as no other cakewalk ever
stirred it, and the tongues are awag as no other dancer ever set them going.
It was no minuet that the Rev. Mr. Garver tripped, in the good old
fashioned style of our grandparents. It was a regular ragtime cakewalk,
with all of the most modern appurtenances, and he did it cane and hat in
hand, with a young lady on his arm. It was as full of new steps as the
most approved bit of cakewalking. and those who witnessed the little dash
say that the Rev. Mr. Garver has nothing to be ashamed of in regard to his
cakewalking abilities. It all happened at an entertainment given by Palma
Circle of the Women of Woodcraft, the female adjunct to the Woodmen of
the "World. The entertainment proper had closed, and after the musical
numbers the band struck up a cakewalk, in which it was expected that some
of those present would take part. It was hardly expected that the minister
would take his turn, but somehow the spirit of cakewalking moved him and
he did his stepa with the rest. As the ragtime swelled and tripped and
skipped in its hurdle-Jumping way the Rev. Mr. Garver became enthused.
He took a cane and a hat. and with Miss May Hamilton, who is one of the
most expert cakewalkers in the bay region, he did his turn down the room
and back again.
Being a wearer of "the cloth," and in addition a large man who bears a
striking resemblance to President McKinley, the minister's cakewalk has
caused no little comment, though, be it said for the sake of the reverend
gentleman, he Is heartily sorry that he took those steps. It was done at a
semi-public entertainment, and that -is where the trouble came and how the
story got out. .Ragtime Is more popular now .in Haywards than ever before,
and cakewalking has been given an additional impetus from its ministerial
backing. . . ,;â¢ .' r â¢'

V
High School at -eeary and Scott streets.
There are now on fllÂ« with the commis
sion 571 applications for the examination
as copyist, of which 337 have been filed
by men and 234 by women. All of these
applicants are desirous of filling. the po
sition as copyist, of which there are only
25 in the City Hall, 20 in the Recorder's
office and 16 in the County Clerk's office.
of naval officials.- but no request for the
dispatch of a warship to. either Grey town
or Brlto has been made. ! .
The information is at variance with that
of Senor Corea, the Nicaragua Minister
to. the United States, who called at the
State Department to-day and informed
the officials that the situation in his
country was peaceful; that there was no
danger bo far as he. was aware of a con
flict between Nicaragua and . Costa Rica,
and that- his Government. did not covet
Co3ta Rlcan territory.; >.
It Is understood the < State Â¦ Department
Is proceeding on ' the assumption that
there is danger of trouble and that Min
ister Merry is making efforts to peace
fully settle the difficulty. In view of the
importance of the preservation at this
time of the existing Governments, on ac
count of the political status of the canal
matter, it is proposed by this Government
to do all it can in the way of using its
good offices to prevent hostilities between
the two Central American republics.
REMARKABLE SPEECH
MADE BY CECIL RHODES
KIMBERLEY. Saturday, Feb. 24.â Cecil
Rhodes, presiding at a meeting 1 of the
De Beers Company, delivered a remark
able speech, which was received with en
thusiasm. After announcing that the
year's profits of the De .Beers Company
amounted to Â£2,000,000, be spoke of the
Chartered Company's transactions with
De Beers, and said that the shareholders
were divided into j two classes â imagina
tive and unimaginative. . The latter, he
said, passed their lives filling money bags
that are dissipated by their offspring on
wine, women and horses. To the latter
class, he stated that the transaction with
the Chartered Company had closed satis
factorily, as the De Beers Company
owned all the diamonds wherever Its
charter existed. To the imaginary, he
drew an eloquent picture of these mine 3
100 years hence, as mirroring European
civilzation in the far South. "The lat
ter," he said, "feel a glow of satisfaction
at the thought that the Immense riches
taken from the soil have not been merely
devoted to the decoration of the fair sex."
Speaking ot the war, he considered it a
puzzle why it had arisen. The Transvaal
and the Free State were not republics, he
declared, but oligarchies, and had been
long conspiring to seize British South Af
rica. Each government was simply a
small political gang, who humbugged the
poor Dutchmen), appealing to their pa
triotism and dividing the spoils among
their coteries. The Afrikander has been
working twenty years for independence.
He said that former President Reltz of
the Orange Free State had years ago
avowed that his only ambition in life was
to drive England out of Africa-
After showing how Kimberley had been
defended by citizens, of 'whom 120 had
been killed or wounded, and thanking
General French for his gallant ride, Mr.
Rhodes closed brilliantly, asserting: "We
have done our duty in preserving and
protecting the greatest commercial asso
ciation in the worldâ her Majesty's flag."
m
ENGLISHMEN ADMIRE
CRONJE'S GREAT COURAGE
NEW YORK. Feb. 26.â A dispatch to
the Journal and Advertiser from London
says J. B. Robinson, the African million
aire miner, said:
I have known Cronje long and Intimately, and
wish I could now shake his hand and tell him
how much I. in common. I believe, with every
Englishman, admire the courage he has shown.
He may be our foe. but England Is generous
enough to recognize the good qualities of the
man fighting against her.
Cronje and his 7000 men have certainly re
vealed a heroism never surpassed in the history
of our race. Surrounded by. an army of 45,000
men, with 110 gune continually pouring shells
on :thelr position, they have stood at bay for
days. â¢ It is only .what'" those of us who know
the man expected from Cronje. He will never
of his own will surrender. He may be com
pelled by his men refusing to fight any longer,
but of that I am very doubtful. He Is support
ed by the Old Guard of the Transvaal. No Boer
has such influence over, hia followers. They
believe him invincible. They almost worship
him. â¢Â¦ " : * a.v*; ; i;v f~ '-.-:
I believe He can, if his meri only, stand by
him, resist for weeks.' He made for the spot
where he is now intrenched for two reasons.
First, he wanted to be as near Bloemfontein aa
possible, because his relief would come from
there. Next, he was aware that the situation
he now holds was the best fitted for defense.
It is the bend of the - river, and that means
much of shelter. The South African rivers are
not like English rivers. Here the waters come
up to the top of the banks; in South Africa the
steep sides mount up ten, twenty and even
thirty feet above the water.
In these banks caves can easily be made In
which men and stores can be placed. As soon
as Cronje reached this spot they speeded the
defensive preparations. Stores having been put
away, each man would dig a shelter trench,
and If it had not been for these trenches the
men must all have been quickly annihilated
by our artillery fire. Each shelter trench not
only goes down, but has a part scooped out at
the side -In which a man can He In safety
while lyddite and shrapnel are pouring on the
earth above him. Unless a shell actually falls
In a trench It does the man no damage. *"Â¦ ' Â¦
In these trenches the Boers He, a few men
being placed aa sentries above. The moment
the sentry gives the alarm up the men spring
and pour a -rifle flre on any storming party.

FOUR YEARS TO
BE THE COURSE
IN HIGH SCHOOL
The Abolition of Extra Study
Will Soon Bring About'
That Result.
Board of Education Will Ultimately
Adopt, Flan of Eight Tears in
Primary and Grammar
Grades.
The, repent agitation of improvement
clubs and individuals against the require
ment of extra study for pupils in the pub
lic schools will, have 'its sequel at to-mor
row's meeting of the Board of Education,
when Director - Denman will ' introduce
resolutions providing that the rules be
changed so that no such study will bo
exacted In the primary grades, one-half
hour in the fifth, sixth and seventh
grades, one hour in the eighth grade and
one and one-half hours in the ninth grade.
It is the opinion of Superintendent Web
ster and other prominent educators that
this plan is but a step in the direction of
increasing the High School term from
three to four years. They contend that
the virtual abolition of extra study will
have the effect of reducing the intellect
ual standard of the pupil who presents
himself for admission to the High School,
or in other words, that the pupil will
come to the High School Illy prepared to
undertake the curriculum of that institu
tion and as a consequence the term will
have to be lengthened in order that suf
ficient time may be afforded to acquire
properly the various branches of tho
course.
Chairman Mark, in discussing the pos
sibility of the High School term being in
creased, said that the plan of Eastern
cities providing for four years in the pri
mary grades, four years in the grammar
and four years in the High School would
in all likelihood be ultimately adopted by
the board, but that the matter had not as
yet been considered officially or at any
great length. He wa* also of the opinion
that the doing away with extra study
would bring about that result, but how
soon he could, not tell.
Superintendent Webster also realizes
that the four-year High School term is
almost an assured fact. While not op
posing such a contingency Mr. Webster
says that the change cannot be made
without a serious danger of "overgrading
or retrograding" the pupils, as it would
necessitate the possible introduction of
the ninth grade in the High School, and
the reconstruction of the primary and
grammar grades.

NO CARBON MONOXIDE
FOUND IN THE BLOOD
Sensational Story of an Evening
Newspaper Exploded by the Use
of the Solar Spectrum.
Coroner Cole yesterday received thÂ© re
port of the city chemist In the matter of
his examination of the blood of Mrs.
Christine Schuldt, to the effect that he
had failed to find any traces of the toxic
results of carbon monoxide and - that
Morgue Surgeon Leland'a report that
death had ensued from natural causes
was correct.
Mrs. Schuldt was a widow, a domestic
servant by occupation, and resided at 730
California street. On the afternoon of
Washington's birthday she was found un
conscious on the sidewalk at the Intersec
tion of Valencia and Twentieth streets
and was taken to the City Receiving Hos
pital, where she died shortly after. . A
report was current and printed in one of
the evening newspapers that she had been
asphyxiated by Inhaling illuminating gas
and that after she got on the street the
carbon monoxide In her blood caused her
to fall in a faint. There was no founda
tion for the story.

LIGHTS, MUSIC
AND FEATURES
FOR CARNIVAL
Success of Mardi Gras Ball
to Be Given To-Night Is
Assured.
To-night society will pay Its homageto
the genius of art. The lights were turned
on at Mark Hopkins Institute on the hill
last evening' and, revealed marvels of
beauty in decoration. The main gallery,
known as the Jester's room, and the new
gallery, known as the throne room, did
light up remarkably well. . .
Kverything is in order for the carnival
event to-night. Six hundred and thirty
tickets have already been sold. The cash
receipts from this source and the income
from the sale of boxes puts the Art As
sociation "out of the woods," in a finan
cial sense. It is noted by the manage
ment of the association that society of
the highest grade is giving the enterprise
its most cordial support.
"The music will be the best ever given
under the auspices of the association,"
says Sir Henry Heyman. A string and
reed band of twenty-five pieces will
be placed in the throne room and a band
of twenty in the jester's room.
At 9:30 o'clock the trumpeter will sound
a call for attention. Immediately the
i herald, Theodore Keane, will make an
nouncement to the assembled throng. The
procession will then form and move to
the -music of the stately grand march
from "Tannhauser" through the jester's
room and Court of Beauty to the throne
in the new art gallery. When the proces
sion has passed the throne Prince Carni
val will proclaim the reign of merriment
and then the festivities will begin.
The music will embrace . waltzes com
posed by the elder Strauss, father of the
great Johann Strauss. Music of Lanner
and Gungl will delight the dancers. As
the hours glide by the. band will play the
modern music of Sullivan, Sousa, Victor
Herbert and Waldteufel. Melodies an I
familiar coon songs will not get the over
look. Â¦ .
The managers of the affair desire If to
be known that no one other than mem
bers of the committee will be permitted
to remain-in the vise room. If the plans
laid by Edward ' M. Greenway are ex
ecuted the spectators in the boxes and
the general throng of onlookers will see a
procession worthy of review.
The finishing touches will be placed on
the decorations - to-day, and thorough
tests of the lighting apparatus will be ap
plied." No doubt additional applications
for tickets of admission will be mad" to
day by persons holding Invitations. There
are assurances that many original and
beautiful' costumes will be seen In the
marching column. . Â» â¢>Â¦ i
GREAT FINISH
TO THE GUNST
AT OAKLAND
Rosormonde, With ; Jenkins
Up, Downs Storm King
by a Short Nose.
Splendid Sport in Which All Six
Favorites Beach the Wire
First â Books Are Hard
Hit.
Just the loss of a jockey's whip cost
the black horse Storm King's backers a
pot of money at Oakland yesterday, and
the mishap no doubt returned Bosor
monde, the consistent and game daugh
ter of Ormonde and Fairy Rose, winner
of the Gunst stake. The $1500 prise was
the feature of the card on reopening day
at the track over the bay, attracting a
field of Elx to the post. Bendoran had
been allotted top weight by the handi
ctpper, 130 pounds, and the crowd looked
to ccc the big horse fight It out for flrat
place with Kosormonde, carrying 11*.
vVhen the horses were called there was
little to choose between the pair in the
betting, although the mare probably did
Â«njoy a slight call. Storm King, with 101
pounds in the saddle, warmed up so well
thsa the books were quickly compelled
to <~ut the 15 to 1 against him. Botn the
three-year-old Flamora and Imperious as
well had a respectful following. Strange
to say, everybody .was nght a&ain. Spen
cer sailed away at a. tÂ«*rnttc ctip on Â£Â»en
doran, chased Djr Fiamora, and when the
Etretch was reached they were fit subjects
for the undertaker. Powell on &torm King
loomed up as a dangerous candidate. Op
posite the trainers' stand, Jenkins man
aged to get Kosoimonde up on equal
terms srltn the black, while both lads
were rtaing like Trojans. When the game
was hottest. Powell lost his whip, and
though striving desperately to hoid the
lead, was outridden and beaten by the
pcantest of noses, the gallant mare run
ning the mile anil a Sixteenth in l:4t>Vj.
Bendoran, with his big impost up. was a
very crcditabie third, three lengtns away.
Fiamora was unfortunate i-nougn 'to
throw one or her plates early during the
struggle and later was cut oS lii the
etretcu by iiendoran.
It is a refreshing fact to relate that
favorites showed tuUCfl better form than
at Ihe tjan Matco County track, taking
ail tix events on the cara. Tne weather
wae yeriect tor racing purposes and the
track fast.
The fast youngster Corn Cake started
Jor the. nrst time In the colors of Book
maker Caesar \oung in the scramble for
two-year-olds, liis price went trom 7 to
10 to even money, and he won easing up
from Impromptu, combermarie, a varm
tip. backed Irom S down to 16 to 5, was
nosed out for the show by Socapa.
Pat Morritisey came out fresh and
frisky as a two-year-old, taking the seven
furlong telling run, with 13 to 20 about
him in the ring. Thorpe had him in front
from, the start, winning comparatively
easily. Don Luis was the contender
throughout. Colonel Koot, a 100 to 1 shot,
experienced a return of speed, finishing a
close third.
To Johnny Bullman's persuasive saddle
work more than anything else can be
ascribed the victory of \\ yoming in the
mile, decided under selling conditions.
Played down to 6 to 5 favoritism. Wyom
ing assumed the front position when half
the route had been tramped, and hÂ«rd
ridden ihe last sixteenth downed Socialist
a length. Jenkins, astrike Racivan, fin
ished third.
It looked very much as if Jenkins threw
the fiftn race away. With .the leg up on
Scotch Plaid, equal choice in the betting
with Tappan. he beat the barrier, but* in
stead of going on held the bay horse un
der forty wraps to the stretch. When it
came to a drive he was collared and
l*eaten out by Bullman. riding Tappan in
slow time:
Looking ai: the best of the eight start
ers in the final six furlong sprint, the ring '
laid 5 to. 2 against Novia in the first bet
ting. T. Walsh rode the mare, and" she
after racing Peace to a standstill, won
very cleverly from Pompino. Jingle Jin
gle, under Phelans weak riding, was a
good third.

A FRACTIOUS TEAM
CAUSES A STAMPEDE
A team of horses attached to a light
dray ran away on Market street last even
ing, causing a stampede among pedestri
ans who were hurryin? to their homes.
One of the horses finally fell and was so
badly crippled that it had to be killed.
The team belonged to William Schust
ler and was being driven by "Jack" Mc-
Carthy, an experienced horseman. When
near Third street one of the horses be
came unmanageable and started to run.
In his anxiety to check "the horse Mc-
Carthy dropped the reins and the
team dashed up Market street, with Mc-
Carthy clinging to the seat to save him
self from being thrown off. At Fourth
street the frightened animals swerved
from the pavement to the sidewalk,
stampeding the crowd of men and women
and narrowly escaped wrecking the front
of the Cafe Royal. At this Juncture one
of the horses fell, breaking its leg, and
Poundmaster Waldron, at the request or
McCarthy, promptly relieved the animal
of its sufferings.

BODY OF NEW-BORN
INFANT THROWN AWAY
The dead body of a fully developed mala
infant was found yesterday in an unoc
cupied lot at the intersection of Missis
sippi and Army streets, tied In a sack.
The discovery was made by John Wil-
son, John Kearney and Thomas Lyons,
whose curiosity was aroused by the ap
pearance of ,the sack. The ghastly find
was taken to the Potrero police station,
where it was examined by Dr. J. A. Simp
son. The skull had been crushed, evi
dently by strong pressure, as there were
no abrasions to show that any blows had
been struck.
The body was taken to the Morgue for
an autopsy to establish or disprove the
theory of murder.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1900.
GOLD HUNTERS
WHO WILL TAKE
MANY CHANCES
Pitcairn Sails Thursday on
a Bold Attempt to Make
Nome in April,
Steamer South Coast in Trouble In
the Bay â Movement of (Trans
ports and Disposition of
Soldier Dead.
The passengers and crew of the ex
missionary brig Pitcairn are. going to
make a bold attempt to be the first at
Cape Nome in the spring.. In spite of
the fact that steamboat men and whalers
all agree that it will.be a waste of time
to start before April, at the earliest, Cap
tain Nesbitt is confident that he will' be
able to land his passengers and their.bag
gage on the shore ice some time in v.at
month. In 'order to do that, the. Pitcairn
is to sail for St. Lawrence Island next
Thursday. On leaving the Golden Gate
she, will stand out to the westward until
the Japan current is met. Then a course
for St. Lawrence Island will be laid.
Last year and the year before there
was no flow of ice between March. 29 and
April 19 in the straits, and Captain Nes
bltt expects the same conditions to pre
vail this year. Should his surmises prove
to be correct, the Pltcairn will go from
St. Lawrence Island to the shore ice that
imprisons Cape Nome, and over it the
gold hunters will make their way to the
new El Dorado. After landing the pas
sengers, the Pitcairn will be taken to
Port Clarence and laid up.
The people on the Pitcairn have con
sidered all' chances, however, and are
willing to 'run the risks. Among those
who are going are: A. B. Couch, L. A.
Petton. G. Kelly. O. M. - Paris. Ed Short,
J. L. Woods, Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Gold
stein, W. D. Montgomery.. J. W. Staples,
H. F. Pierce, William Plasterer. H. H.
Hixson. Charles Condon. R. H. Woods,
H. L. Burleson. G. R. Parish. E. L. Tret
ten and T. Richards. 'They all expect to
be in Nome City before April 30.
Captain J. F. Higgins died at his home
in Berkeley yesterday. He was. formerly
master of the Excelsior and took the
first load of â¢ passengers to St. Michaels
on her- that ever went through to the
Klondike.
Reinsurance on the overdue ships Annie
Thomas and May Flint took another Jump
yesterday. The Thomas went to 60 jper
cent and the Flint to 35 per cent. The
former is on her way from Cardiff 'to
Acapulco and the latter from Hongkong
to Tacoma. . .
The steamer South Coast got Into trou
ble early yesterday morning while on her
way to Vallejo street wharf. A clever
scow captain had anchored his boat about
100 yards from .the end of one of the
Wharves and then ran a line from the
scow to the shore. The South Coast came
along and picked the rope up in her
wheel. It took two divers over an hour
to cut the rope away in order that the
steamer might get to sea again.
Captain' Malmros has taken command
of the.barkentlne Leslie D, vice Captain
Peterson, resigned.
The ex-transport Manauense goes to
Xanaimo, B. C. Wednesday to load coal
for Honolulu. The transport Indiana sails
to-day and the Thomas next Thursday
for Manila with stores. The remains of
the dead soldiers were to have been re
moved from the Hancock yesterday.
There was so much disinfecting gas in
the holds, however, that the men could
not work, so the bodies will not be moved
until to-day. , \%irg&fe3Bl!s&Â§BÂ£sl
