LONDON, Feb. 13.â The
one important item of war
news this morning does
:ot come from South Africa. It
s the statement of Lord Lans
lowne in the House of Lords
:hat Lord Roberts is in direct
rommand of all the British
orces at Modder River. It is
nore than likely that London
vili next hear of the commander
n-chief from somewhere in the
All kinds of surmises are afloat
as to Lord Roberts' plan of cam
paign. The preponderance of
expert opinion favors a move
ment something like this: That
General French, with every
mounted man who can be spnred,
shall lead the advance in the Free
State from some point between
De Aar and Modder River; that
a large force of infantry, includ
ing the Seventh (Tucker's) Di
vision, shall follow under the per
sonal command of Lord Roberts;
that Methuen, Kelly-Kenny and
Gatacre, with the aid of General
Brabant's irregular horse, shall
occupy the attention of the Boers
in their immediate vicinity, while
Buller hammers away at Jou
le's nrroy and tries, if possible,
to relieve Ladysmith.
When the composition of the
force for the invasion of the Free
States becomes known it would
not be surprising to find that
Roberts has at least 40,000 men.
General Tucker paid a visit to the
Modder River recently. Presum
ably he would not have done this
unless his force was in some wa>
to co-operate in the grand move
ment.
Lord Roberts is very fond ot
the kilted regiments, and the
Highland Brigade, under Gen
eral Hector Mac Donald, will un
doubtedly form a part of the in
vading force. Lord Roberts in
timated this in his speech to the
brigade on Sunday, when he said
that the Highlanders would have
a march with him which would
not be a walkover, but he be
lieved it would be successful.
On the eve of the expected
great movement by Lord Rob
erts' army it is interesting to re
call that to-day is the one hun
dred and twenty-fifth day of the
war; that the imperial troops in
South Africa now number about
165,000, men with 15,000 more
in transit; that the British losses
in killed and wounded and miss
ing aggregate 11,000 men, and
that with the exception of the Free
Staters being driven from Gras
Pan, behind the line of the Mod
der River, the Boers to-day hold
the same position that they seized
when they first surrounded Lady
smith, Kimberley and Mafeking
and overran Natal and Northern
Cape Colony.
The failure of the Government
to make any announcement with
reference to the dispatch of fur
ther reinforcements to South
.Africa caused some surprise last
nWht in Parliament. The Gov
ernment's military proposals sub
mitted yesterday are criticized as
bepg inadequate and of a make
shit character. There is no radi
callreform, no attempt to build
up a second scheme of military

ROBERTS PLANS AN INVASION
OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE
ARMY BACON SOLD
FOR PRIVATE GAIN
Twenty-Three Thousand Dollars
Stolen During the War.
Government Detective's Sensational Charges,
Involving United States Senator
Taliaferro of Florida.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Feb.
12.â Charges have been preferred against' Major George Ruthers, which. If
sustained by the promised investigation, will result in court-martial pro
ceedings. The charges were filed December 23, by Jay G. Holland, an
army detective' attached to the quartermaster' 3 department. He accuses
Ruthers, while depot quartermaster, stationed at Jacksonville, with having un
lawfully disposed of 215,000 pounds of bacon, worth approximately $23,000. Hol
land on December 23 made the following startling sworn statement to Secretary
Root: I|jsJXÂ§
"I was a Government detective assigned to duty with the Seventh Army
Corps at Jacksonville, in September, IS9S. The loss of a number of mules was
reported, and I was Instructed by Colonel Pond, chief quartermaster, to inves
tigate and report to him. I was following up a clew in this connection, which
led me to the Windsor Hotel In Jacksonville, and there I saw Major Ruthers. C.
B. Rogers and J. P. Taliaferro (now United States Senator) in close and earn
est conversation. I attached no Importance to this, until my friend, John Walsh,
approached me and said that he had overheard part of the conversation be
tween the parties named, which he thought concerned the crooked disposition
of a quantity of Government bacon.
"As it was in my line of duty, and taking the hint. I made It my business to
learn something of the nature of the conference, which was to the effect that
Ruthers was to deliver to the Rogers company the bacon: the Rogers company
was to dispose of it and divide the prortts between the three.
"I promptly reported to Colonel Pond, who in turn referred me to Colonel
Wood, chief commissary officer. The latter officer sent me to see Ruthers about
the matter, and when the object was made known to him he admitted that he had
condemned a quantity of bacon, and, with a display of arrogance, added that tho
quartermaster's department had its hands full to look after its own affairsâ th?t
he was fully capable to look after tho commissary department. This statement I
repeated to the commanding officer,- who was apparently satisfied with his reply.
"However, I w?s determined to follow the deal to a climax. Shortly after my
interview with Ruthrrs, Rogers purchased the schooner Tortugas. commanded by
Captain Myers, on which was loaded the meat and shipped to Jamaica and sold
at the market price of fresh bacon. I made every effort to ship as one of the crew
on this boat, but did not succeed. One jf the crew, on the return to Jacksonville
after disposition had been mad*Â» of the cargo, told me that part of this very same
meat was fed to the crew while on the trip and that it was perfectly wholesome,
which disproves any statement mado to the department that it had been con
demned and was unfit for human consumption.
"During the time the Tortugas was on the trip I overheard another conversa
tion between the same parties at the same hotel with reference to the amount of
profits each would derive from the transaction.
"Shortly after my suspicions were confirmed charges were preferred with tho
War Department against Ruthers, but nothing was ever heard from the depart
mentânot even an acknowledgment. Therefore, after the charges had been
slumbering in th/ department for several months, T determined that I would ap
prise them of *Jsf.s flagrant and dishonest abuse of authority. I went to see Gen
eral Miles r.31 handed General Miles' chief aide written specifications of the
charges here substantially recited. Receiving ' no formal acknowledgment from
his headquarters, I called on the Secretary of War. who assured me that tho
charges would be promptly Investigated. In this connection nothing was heard
from the department until January 22, when .the adjutant general wrote, stating
.that the charges had been recelvccl ami referred to the Secretary of War tor inTeÂ»- '
tlgatlon" Â¦ .
Former Army Detective Holland has made a sworn statement to the truth
of the charges, and it is known in Washington that Senator Taliaferro is- vice
president of the C. E. Rogers Company and is so credited in the Congressional
directory- Â¦ '
seen one or two in one battle and five or
six in another.
"Our men have thrown themselves upon
the veldt and have fired for hours at a
time at noise or flame and trenches of the
enemy, whom they could not see. At
Modder River there were whole battalions
of ours that did not know at the end of
the day whether the enemy was north or
south of the river. A European army
fighting under European rules is a clumsy
weapon against the Boer, who opposes us
with weapons which render one man as
good as ten and all ten invisible. We re
member the old saying, that an army
moves upon its belly, and we paraphrase
It to make it read 'A modern army must
fight upon its belly.*
"If Germany got in a trench that could
not be turned all the world could advance
and be slaughtered, 'but all the world
could not oust Germany from that
trench."

"For a â¢ frontal attack the old . military
"manuals declared that :the . attacking
force must be three times that of .the de

ons, ,it is said , that \ ten men must attack

ditlons of the war which : we are experi

to never seen before,; for. there are men in
our arnjy.who have, never: seen a Boer in
battle. I know^of officers ; who. have only.
ing 110,000 men available for for
eign service. But of these no,
000 a vast majority are men who
had been weeded out of the ranks
before sending the army to South
Africa and are mainly very young
soldiers, or in case of reservicc
men with physical ailments. To
this regular force the Govern
ment purposes to add twelve bat
talions. Practically very few
soldiers will be added by this to
the army, for the .men are to be
drawn from the surplus strength
of the First and ' Second bat
talions, which have been sent to
foreign service, and from the re
serves. Four regiments of reg
ular cavalry are also to be added,
but it is only a rearrangement of
the number of men now under
arms and not any addition to the
strength of the army. In artil
lery there is to be a substantial
addition of thirty-six field and
seven horse batteries, giving 158
more guns. As for calling out
any large part of the volunteer
force nothing is promised,
though it is considered this is. a
necessary measure in view of the
danger of serious foreign compli
cations. :

BITTER TOWARD
UNITED STATES
German Agriculturists
in Convention.
BERLIN, Feb. 12.â T0-day began the
conventions held annually at this time of
the year at which all the important agri
cultural Interests of Germany are repre
sented for purposes of report and discus
sion. Foremost among these is the Fed
eration of Husbandmen, which assembled
60,000 strong. The annual report showed
a membership of 206,000, which is an in
crease of 19,000 upon the membership re
ported at the last meeting.
In opening the proceedings . Herr
Roesicke. who reviewed the work of the
year, pointed out that the projected Mes
opotamia colony would benefit a number
of leading German capitalists, but would
enable Mesopotamia wheat to enter Ger
many at 60 marks per ton. He spoke con
fidently with reference to- the meat in
spection bill, predicting that it would; not
pass, as the Foreign Office had drawn it
up for the benefit of the United States.
Herr Harm, the next speaker, fiercely
attacked Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial
Chancellor, who, he said, gave Germany
"only fair words, but not fair deeds." He
expressed the hope that a determined re
sistance against the United States would
be adopted by the Reichstag and the vari
ous diets.
Dr. yon Friego-WeltElon, Vice Presi
dent of the Reichstag, joined in the at
tack upon the Imperial Chancellor, say
ing that German agriculture hoped for a
future Chancellor who would walk In the
footsteps of Bismarck.
The convention then adopted a five-para
graph resolution forcibly, demanding Gov
ernment aid for agriculture and energetic
steps against the United States and Great
Britain, as countries violating the most
favored nation clause. The resolution In
timated that* the votes of the agrarians
could be had for the naval augmentation
bill only If the Government should, first
favor the agrarians.
The convention sent a congratulatory
telegram to Dr. Leyds at Brussels.
During the last few days the;, chances of
the naval bill have perceptibly. diminished.
The semi-official Berliner Post to-night
reckons with the possibility of a rejection
after the -Easter Holidays,- and adds that
in case the Reichstag is dissolved new,

In justice to you, I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the
sample bottle of Swamp Root you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five
years with kidney and bladder trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would re-
lieve me for the time being, but the old complaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a
sample bottle of Swamp Root, and I found it did me a world of good. Since then I have taken
eight small bottles bought at my drugstore, and I consider myself perfectly cured. I do not have to
get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did, three or four' times a night, but now sleep the
sleep of peace. My back is all right again and in every way lam a new man. Two of my brother
officers are still using Swamp Root: They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise'of it. 'lt is a
boon to mankind. We recommend it to all humanity who are suffering from kidney and bladder
diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter) as well as myself thank you
for the blessing you have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp Root. We re-
main, yours very truly, JAMES COOK,

DEAR SIRS:â â¢

fully recommend your medicine to any one suffering from kidney disease.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
I had been a sufferer for the past five years from severe
attacks of rheumatism and kidney trouble, probably con-
tracted by exposure on hunting expeditions and wadinz
streams. I tried many remedies, the patent and other kind,
but none of them seemed to do me any good. I was per-
suaded by an old and valued friend to try Swamp-Root,
and frankly confess that it has benefited me as no other
medicine has. I now feel like myself again. Ido not have
the constant aches and pains which at one time seemed to
make life unbearable. It is a positive benefit in ailments of
this kind. I always keep it in the house, as it is iust as ne-
cessary as bread and butter. Very respectfully,

To Whom ft May Concern :
- I was all run down in health and spirits, from overwork on
the Exchange floor. I developed nervous neuralgia and also
suffered, from an acute attack of rheumatism. , :
Of course. I had' careful medical attendance, but while con-
valescing my own physician himself ordered me to take Swamp-
Root to build up my nervous system, and put my kidneys in shape.
It helped me more than any curative or tonic I ever used and
now I always keep it in my medicine chest. With best wishes
for sufferers.

DR. KILMER & CO.,
GENTLEMEN:
IFrom the New York Journal, January 4-th; 19OO.)
Reporters Have Convincing Interviews With Prominent People nf Greater New York
. Regarding Wonderful ' Cures.
How to Find Out if You
i- Need Swamp-Root.
.It used to be considered that only uri-
nary and bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
their beginning in the disorder of
these most important organs.
" The kidneys filter and purify tÂ»*. s lood
â that is their work.
So when your kidneys are weak or
out of order, you can understand how
(iuickly your entire body is affected, and
Â¦how every organ seems to fail to do its
duty.
- If you are sick or "feel badly," begin
taking the famous new discovery. Dr.'
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help
all the other organs to health.
Disordered kidneys are responsible for,
more sickness and suffering than any
other disease. Kidney trouble irritates
the' nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, i
sleepless and irritable. Makes you pass !
water often during the day and obliges
you to get up many times during the
night. Causes rheumatism and neural-
gia, pain or dull ache in the back, ioints
and muscles, makes your head ache and !
back ache, causes indigestion, stomach
and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yel-
low complexion; makes you feel .is
though you had heart trouble; you have
plenty of ambition, but no strength, get
weak and waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the world-fa-
mous kidney remedy.
1 In taking Swamp-Root you afford na-
tural help to nature, for Swamp-Root is
the most perfect healer and gentle aid to
the kidneys that is known to medical
science. '
If there is any doubt in your mind as
to your condition, take from your urine
On rising about four ounces, place it in
a glass or bottle, and let it stand twen-
ty-four hours. If, on examination, it is
milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust
settling, or if small particles float about
in it, your kidneys are in need of imme-
diate attention.

Special Dispatch to The Cn\\.
TIFLIS, Feb. 3, via Paris, Feb. 12.â The
recent mobilization of Russian troops on
the border of Afghanistan is being fol
lowed up with all dispatch. Secret orders
have been Issued by Lieutenant General
Kouropatkine, Minister of War, calling
for immediate concentration at Kouschka,
on the Afghan frontier, of all Russian
troops garrisoned In the Caucasus, includ
ing the Mussulman native reserve regi
ments of infantry and cavalry, "and par
ticularly," the order is said to read, '.'all
ofhcers and privates who are familiar
with Asiatic languages and dialects."
From other quarters come advices cal
culated to be of interest to Great Britain.
From Kabul comes news that the Ameer
of Afghanistan is active in Russia's In
terest, busily disposing of his troops at
important points throughout the country.
Private advices from Massowah. on the
Red Sea, characterize the attitude of Ne
gus Menelik as "suspicious and his policy
doubtful." It is understood, according to
the correspondent, that the Negus, is en
deavoring to come to an agreement with
Great Britain regarding Abyssinia's Sou
danese pretensions, and he is inclined to
ally himself with that country as against
Russia. The reason Is said to He in the
poverty of Abyssinia and the necessity of
accepting Great Britain's financial assist
ance. -
PARIS, Feb. 12.â Count Leontleff, Gov
ernor of the equatorial provinces of Abys
sinia, protests in a communication to the
press from Marseilles against j the Cairo
dispatch, which made him prejudge the
intentions of Emperor Menelik relative to
Great Britain. He say.s that as 'an officer
in the army of the Negus any speculation
of this nature would be forbidden him,
and that the words attributed to him were
even contrary to his own opinion, because
he has long "been personally convinced
that the Negus has the greatest desire to
preserve the best relations with all of the
neighboring powers. Count Leontleff
says that his visit to Cairo had no official
character.
WILL SAVE ELECTRIC TOWER.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 12.â The big electrlo
light tower which has gained such prom
inence for San Jose will not be taken down
Just at present, although the light and
power company which .owns it has been
threatening to do so.
C. W.- Quilty, the manager of the com
pany, appeared , before the City Council
this morning and presented a proposi
tion to sell the tower to the city. He said
it was a constant expense to the company,
which paid taxes on it. It had cost J7OOO
and would not be worth $1200 for Iron pipe.
The Light and Power Company had de
cided to dispose of It. He said If the city
did not buy It the tower would be taken
down. After some discussion the Council
decided to light It and to give the con
tract to the Light and Power .Company.
This move on the part of the Council
savors of politics and is evidently a gen
tle - rebuke to - Manager Edwards of the
Electric Improvement. Company for as
piring to the mayoralty, y The Electric
Improvement Company has the contract
for lighting the city. Two weeks ago its
plant burned down, but it is about ready
to resume lighting the city or will be when

The Council took advantage of this mat
ter and will award the contract to the
Light and Power Company for lighting
the tower. For the past year the tower
has not been lighted.
Cornell Released.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 12.-Before Judge
Hughes this morning Charles Edwin Cor
nell, brought here from Folsom Prison on
a writ of habeas corpus, was discharged.
Cornell was arrested in Modesto three
years ago on charges of grand larceny.
He pleaded guilty to one charge, and was
sentenced to three years, and afterward
pleaded guilty to a second charge and was
sentenced to two years In the State prison.
His attorney claimed that the two sen
tences were concurrent, and that when he
had completed the three-year sentence he
had also completed the two-year sentence,
and should have been discharged. War
den Wilkinson claimed that one sentence
began on ther completion of the other, and
that Cornell had still two years to serve.
Jqdge Hughes took the view of the pris
oner's attorney and ordered that Cornell
be set free.

LONDON. Feb. 12.â The House of Com
mons was crowded to-day in anticipation
of a statement from Mr. George Wynd
ham, Parliamentary Secretary of the War
Office, in regard to the army measures.
Joseph H. Choate, the United States Em
bassador, Henry White, the Secretary of
the United States Embassy, and W. T.
Baker, president of the Chicago Board of
Trade, were among those present in the
distinguished strangers', gallery.
Mr. Wyndham arose amid cheers when
the House went into committee on supply
and said that he did not propose to deal-
heard a single figure mentioned as tc trio
cost thereof, nor even In regard to the
particular vote. How much of the mcney
required was due to the present war?
To this question Mr. Wyndham replied
Â£420,000.
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman said ho
could not be expected to pronounce an
opinion on the scheme suddenly, but, he
added, he believed nine-tenths of his hear
ers were ready to do -almost anything f it
the purpose of the present war. but would
like to regard it as a war measure alor.e,
leaving the question of the future increase
NOTABLES AT THE FRONT.
with the question of the prosecution of the
war, but would immediately outline other
military measures necessary for plac
ing home defense on a satisfactory foot
ing. The Government, he continued, had
not even considered the question of com
pulsory service, which was entirely unnec
essary in view of the active recruiting for
the auxiliary forces. During the spring
and summer the volunteer artillery will
be rearmed. Mounted Infantry In the vol
unteer corps would be formed., Artillery
services and the corps of engineers neces
sary for two additional army corps would
be raised forthwith, namely, thirty-six
field batteries and seven hprse batteries.
The speaker also said It had been decided
to raise twelve additional infantry battal
ions.
Continuing Mr. Wyndham said the ex
isting cavalry forces would also be ex
panded to seven regiments and that com
missions would be offered to militia offi
cers to the colonies and to the universi
ties. '
At present, the, speaker further pointed
out, there were 109,000 regulars in the
country and the increase was anticipated
to be 30,000. There were now 328,000 men In
the auxiliary forces, and It was estimated
the increase would be 50,000 men. So alto
gether the country would soon have at
least 517,000 men, and Mr. "Wyndham anti
cipated that the number would be nearer
Â£00,000 than half a million.
In the course of his remarks Mr. "Wynd
h.am referred to fhe Government's confi
dence In the power and splendid efficiency
of the fleet, saying it was never greater
or more legitimate than now. The Gov
ernment, Mr. Wyndham said, was not
making an appeal for money and men In
a spirit of panic. The risk was not much
nearer than a year ago, but it had in
creased In exact proportion to the re
duction of the home military defense,
which sufficed to Justify the present de
mands for an Increase of the resources
for home defense.
Mr. Wyndham's announcement that
commissions in the regular army would be
offered to the colonies was received with
great cheering. -
Sir Charles ptlke,' Advanced , Radical
member for the Forest of Dean district of
Gloucestershire, said Mr. Wyndham's
speech "seemed to support the heresy that
Great Britain should rely upon home de
fense while the truth was that the most
powerful defense lay in the striking power
of the fleet."
The Liberal leader. Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, who followed, said he had
heard of the great s-chume for the admin
istration .of a great army, but had not
and rearrangements open for future dis
cussion.
It was explained In the lobbies of the
House of Commons that Mr. Wyndham
meant to convey that all the supplement
ary estimates asked for were due to the
war. except Â£420.000 required for the new
scheme to close the financial year of
March 31.SHIPMENTS IN BOND.
House Passes the Bill Extending the
Law's Scope.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â An important
bill was passed by the House to-day,
which makes universally applicable the
law that now permits the transit In bond
of goods through the United States. Goods
in bond may be shipped through any por
tion of the territory of the United States
to foreign ports. It Is principally de
signed to give the transportation compa
nies of the United' States a portion of the
transcontinental trade to the Orient. The
bill also repeals the law of March 1, 1595
prohibiting the shipment of goods in bond
to the Mexican free zone. The latter pro
vision was fought by Stephens of Texas.
The remainder of the day was occupied
in passing the private pension bills favor
ably acted upon at last Friday night's ses
sion and in District of Columbia legisla
tion. '

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Feb. 12.â There

gota for the purpose of furnishing a crisis
which the Government is anxious to avoid
on account of disaffection among the mili
tary as well as in the civil: service. The
end, however, is thought to be near.
and Is now in the possession 1 of the pros
ecuting attorney.
APPLICATIONS FOR
INJUNCTIONS HEARD
CINCINNATI. Feb. 12.â 1n the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge W.
H. Taft heard arguments this- afternoon
for over three hours on the applications
for injunctions against the Kentucky
State Board of Election Commissioners
and the contestants for the State offices
other than Governor and Lieutenant Gov
ernor. The large courtroom was unable
to hold all who came to the Federal
building for admission. Many of the vis
itors were from the Kentucky side, nota
bly the plaintiffs against the State board,
who are citizens of Covington. The Re
publican State officers were also present,
but the only one of the' defendants in
attendance was Judge Pyntz of the State
board. There were quite a number pres
ent from Frankfort and Louisville.
Ex-Governor Bradley, on being asked
by Judge Taft to state the case, began
at once In a plain statement of the ground
upon which the action of the court is
invoked. After reciting the provisions by
which the State Board of Elections is
converted into a board of contest, he de
clared that they were entirely repugnant
to a republican form of government,
which provides for three distinct depart
ments. -He asserted that this Board of
Contest had been made a judicial body
by the Goebel law. At this point Judge
Taft inquired whether the Goebef law had
been passed upon by ' the Court of Ap
peals. Governor Bradley replied that it
had, but his contention was that, never
theless, in case he could show the law to
be in contravention of the Federal con
stitution, then this court could be In
voked. Judge Taft replied that a decision
of the State court on the constitution
ality of the law did not necessarily pre
vent jurisdiction by the United States
Court of Appeals, where a proper case
could be shown.
Lawrence Maxwell Jr., on behalf of the
defendants, made a brief argument on the
two propositions that this court had no
jurisdiction because the petitions do not
present a case of equity and do not fall
under the provisions of the fourteenth
amendment of the constitution of the
United States. He said the situation was
one in which the position of these com
plainants is in course of settlement by a
State tribunal. Contest proceedings In
their cases are pending. This condition
presents none of the features of an equity
case.
After the conclusion of the arguments
Judge Taft advised the counsel that he
would announce his decision, so far as to
the court having jurisdiction in the cases
is concerned, at 2 p. m. on Wednesday
next.
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Feb. 12.-Thls
was another day of unbroken calm
In Frankfort. The Republican mem
bers of the Legislature met at noon
and appointed committees to Inform
Governor Taylor that pursuant to the
terms of his proclamation adjourning
the Legislature at London and calling it
to Frankfort they had come to this city
; and were prepared to transact such busi
ness as micht come before them. The
Governor acknowledged the message and
both houses adjourned until to-morrow.
There were nine members in the Senate
and twenty-eight in the House. The com
mittee which was expected to come from
the Democratic members at Louisville to
report whether it is safe for them to
come to Frankfort did not put in an ap
pearance during the day. The Republi
can leaders say that they expect noth
ing new to transpire until after Judge
Taft of Cincinnati has rendered his de
cision Wednesday.
At one time to-day Governor Taylor de
cided to order away all the soldiers now
here with the exception of a few for a
personal bod> guard. He sent for Colonel
Williams and gave orders for the moving
of the troops, but several of his friends
urged so strongly that the soldiers be per
mitted to remain that Governor Taylor
changed his intention and said that for
the present at least he would not have
any more of them returned to their
homes.
Late this afternoon the detectives work-
Ing upon the Goebel assassination discov
ered a bullet imbedded In one of the trees
on the south side of the Capitol Square.
It struck the tree about twenty inches
from the ground and almost on a line
from the executive building and the spot
where Goebel fell. A block of wood con
taining the bullet was cut from the tree

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.-It is learned
at the Navy Department that the Prince
ton is acting under orders of Admiral
Watson and not under those of General
Otis in raising the flag over the northern
isla-nds of the Philippine archipelago. The
assumption Is that this policy was dictat
ed from Washington.' It Is said that as
the Islands said to have been taken pos
session of are situated north of the
twentieth degree of latitude they are
clearly within the limits of the ceded ter
ritory.
The peace treaty does not fix the north
ern boundary as precisely upon the twen
tieth degree, but as running through the
Bashee Channel, about the twentieth de
gree, and the Islands are south of that
channel.

Rioting Results in Many
Deaths.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York

Herald Company. '
PORT DE FRANCE. Martinique, Feb.
12.â The situation on this island Is very
unsatisfactory, owing to the rioting of
striking laborers. Many white residents
of Francois, where there .were serious
occurrences last Monday, have left that
place and have come here for protection.
The race war is causing great alarm, as
the negroes outnumber the whites many
times. As a result of the rioting in Fran
cois thirteen persons are dead, five more
are dying, while six are suffering from
wounds.
The strike was begun last Monday
morning In Ste. Marie among laborers,
who were, dissatisfied with . their wages.
A crowd of strikers went through, the
plantations in the neighborhood of De
bauchant. They threatened with death
those workingmen who . were satisfied
with their wages and remained at work.
About 400 strikers returned to Ste. Marie,
where they 'were dispersed by infantry.
Several factories shut down voluntarily,
while others were forced to close by the
strikers.
In Francois the etate of affairs was
worse. A factory was guarded by twen
ty-five men of the Marine Corps, under
command of Lieutenant Kahn, who asked
the strikers to retire.
MEN AND WOMEN
ON SAME PLANE
Suffragist Ideas on Insu
lar Possessions.
WASHINGTON, Feb.' 12.â At the morn
ing session of the /National American
Woman Suffrage Association resolutions
were adopted reaffirming the principle
that governments derive their Just pow
ers from the consent of the governed, and
calling for the application of the princi
ple to women; asking Congress to submit
to the State Legislatures a constitutional
amendment prohibiting disf ranchlsement
of United States citizens on account of
sex; asking that upon whatever terms
suffrage may be granted to the men of
Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii or the Phil
ippines, it be granted to women on the
same terms; that women be included in
the census now being taken in Cuba, and
enabled to- take part in the future gov
ernment of the island; also a preamble
reciting that during the past year women
have oast their votes for the first time In
Louisiana. France and Ireland, and call
ing attention to the fact that in Ireland
75 per cent of the women voted; In Paris,
30 per cent, as compared with 14 per
cent of i--e men. and that in New Orleans
and Baton Rouge the women voters car
ried the day for a sewerage system and
a pure-water supply; protesting - against
an alleged intention on the part of cer
tain Government officials to eliminate
women workers from the public service,
to give their place to men voters; con
demning as cruel and unjust all laws and
regulations that make marriage and
motherhod an obstacle to holding a
teacher's position; congratulating the
women of America upon the beneficent
changes of laws and customs by which
full woman suffrage has been secured in
four States and partial suffrage in twen
ty-five States; rejoicing in the ratification
of The Hague treaty and expressing the
profound regret of the association . that
Miss Antnony had determined to retire
from the presidency.
After his wife's death Black still more
steadfastly opposed his daughter's union
with Burdell, but to no avail. Miss Black
became Mrs. Gelen Burdell and John
Black, seeing that opposition was useless,
relented and gave his daughter the Olam
pali ranch. Some time after his daugh
ter's marriage Black took a Mrs. Velasco
to him as his wife. When old John Black
died Mrs. Burdell and Mrs. Black No. 2
met in the same room and in their pres
ence the executors of Black's will broke
the seals and read the testament. All
Black's vast estate was left to Mrs. Ve
lasco.
Mrs. Burdell stepped quickly to the ta
ble and snatching up the will tore it be
yond all hope of putting together again.
She was arrested on a charge of felony
and the case tried before Judgf Almy.
She was found not guilty. Then the mat
ter was carried into the courts and for
months and years the battle raged. Final
ly wearied with litigation, the contestant*
compromised.
Mrs. Velasco took what was called half,
but was in reality rather less, Mrs. Bur
dell having about two-thirds as her share.
This was how Mrs. Burdell came into her
real estate, and those who helped her in
the fight for her dead father's estate were
remembered as follows: Miss Mary
Smith. $15 a month while she remains sin
pie; Mrs. Clark. $10,000; Miss Juanita
Mirando, $1000; Mabel Burdell, the Olam
pall ranch. James Burdell gets his
mother's shares in the Western Refriger
ator Company and Gelen Burdell gets the
remainder of the estate for life, on his
death to to the children.
The will was witnessed by Leander Van
Orden and George Van Orden of Alameda
and George Van Orden of San Francisco
and is dated December 17, 1599.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 12.â The peculiar
distribution of the bequests in the will of
Mrs. Gelen Burdell. filed to-day for pro
bate with County Clerk Graham, points
to some remarkable influence overshad
owing her last hours. The will was made
but a few hours before her death. During
her lifetime Mrs. Burdell was involved as
principal in cne of the most sensational
will contests ever waged in Californiaâ a
contest in which almost all of the
State's prominent lawyers were at one
time or another involved. â¢â¢
To those who stood by her in the will
case and to those only, with the excep
tion of her husband, has any share of the
Burdell estate fallen.
In JK2S John Black, a sailor on a British
man-of-war, slipped overboard . onr night
while his ship lay in San Francisco har
bor, and made his escape into the interior
of what is now Marin County, but then
was divided into "grants." He became a
member of the Spanish colony and mar
ried a Spanish beauty. One daughter was
the result of this union. This daughter
afterward became Mrs. Burdell. Some
years after her daughter, Mrs. Black, be
came afflicted with .an abscess of the Jaw.
Dr. Gelen Burdell. then a well-known
dentist, attended her. During his visits
he met and fell in love with Mrs. Black's
daughter. His affections were returned,
and in spite of their parents' frowns the
young people made up their minds to
marry. All this time Mrs. Black's condi
tion grew worse, and finally an opera
tion was declared necessary. Dr. Burdell
administered an anaesthetic, thereby
causing Mrs. Black's death, as she failed
to rally from its effects.

DOUBLE STANDARD
Financial Debate in the
Senate.
THE COLORADAN'S POSITION
URGES REPUBLICANS TO STICK
TO FHVTRT A T.T.TPTM".
ElMns of West Virginia Maios a
ForciblÂ« Argument for the
Passage of the Fending
Measure*
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The final
Â¦week's discussion of the pending financial
bill was begun In the Senate to-day. The
speakers were two Republicansâ Elkins of
West Virginia and Wolcott of Coloradoâ
and one Populist, Butler of North Caro
lina. Eiklns advocated the passage of the
pending Senate measure in a brief but
forceful argument. Wolcott, chairman of
the International Bimetallic Commission
cf IST, spoke for many Republicans who
adhere to bimetallism, and his speech,
earnest and eloquent, was accorded un
usual attention. Butler closed the debate
for the day, advocating the adoption of his
amendment providing for an issue of pa
per currency by the Government.
Elkins' opening sentences were a refer
ence to the speech delivered on Saturday
by Chandler. He said that was a speech
which would be "distributed by hundreds
of thousands, not by his own political as
eociates, but by his political enemies."
Kikins said in part:
The refunding of the public debt is not necee
Â»*nly a part of the bill. Why mix the subject
cf establishing and denning the moneu.ry
ttandsxd and etrer^thening the public credit
*;th what must at best, unJer the provisions oi
thÂ« bill, be an experiment, and which, il it
fchould fail, would prove hurtful to the general
purpose* and policy of the measure and the
putlic interest? The refunding of the public
debt is purely a practical ur administrative
question. It should have no place in our poll-
Uce or be ci>nnÂ«.-cted in any wise with any polH-
Jca.l questions or measures. The refunding of
the public debt ehould be made the uubject oX
a seiurate bill, to be considered and passed
when our bonds mature and monetary condi
tions may be entirely different.
The bill undertakes too much. It not only
defines and tstabUsiies tiie monetary standard,
but bets, out Â«â¢. scheme to fund the public debt
three years before any of our bonds mature,
end la onitr to make this scheme a success U
provide that the national banks snail be the
tr.oit important factors in its execution.
In ray judgment the public debt â¢ should be
funded without any reference whatever to thÂ«
I^ticna.l banks. Liet the scheme ot funding
.Â¦Â¦: ; :.: on its own merits and by Itself. Let the
Government co forward when the time comes
and borrow money for funding punw^ws at as
low a rate of Interest ac it can, making such
a. rate as wiliinsure the bonds being maintained
a.t par, without depending on national banks or
uny outs-ide agency, and without giving grounds
for the impression that a public d*bt is to be
encouraged and fostered In order to provide a
tafe currency. Moreover, it seems to me we
should reaÂ£h conclusion and legislate from the
statidroint of vision of Ihe highest wave of
X>roÂ«-p*THy the country has ever had. The con
<i:ti' m* which surround us In the financial and
commercial world are extraordinary, l'resent
Javcrable conditions will be followed naturally
lÂ«y a re^ctir)^ that will bring new experience*,,
<ui<i these wi:l enable us. with present experi
ence, to Judge better than now what may be
dune in the matter of funding the public debt
whf-a our bonds mature.
The Senator then suggested that the
Government might find it difficult at some
time in the figure to keep the proposed
i" per cent bonds at par and asked if it
would not be better and in the public in
terest to make the rate of interest higher
and offer no inducements to the national
l>auks. It might turn out. he said, that
the Inducements and advantages offered
the banks might cost the Government
more than the saving 1 in interest that
Â¦would result from funding the debt at 2
per cent.
"It seems to me," said Elkins, "a safer
course would be to ailow a margin of
discretion to the Secretary of the Treas
ury in the matter of refunding the pub
lic debt when the time comes. For in
stance, give him authority to refund at a
rate not exceeding, say, 3 per cent per
annum. We cannot hope to do in the mat
ter of our finances what all other nations,
especially Great Britain, the richest na
tion in the world, has failed to do. She
l:as never reached a standard as low as 2
I>Â«-r cent for her national borrowings."
Wolcott followed Elkins and then But
ler of North Carolina began a speech on
his substitute for the Senate bill entitled
"An act to establish a unit of account."
He maintained that under the constitution
Congress had unlimited authority to man
ufacture money out of gold or silver or
paper, or of either of these or all of them.
He declared that there was but one ques
tion in the making of money and that was
"how much." Congress had authority to
make the money out of anything it desired
end it happened that the wealthy classes
always desired it made of the dearer ma
terial. No matter what the money was
made of. he said, the country would pros
per provided Congress would so regulate
Its sapply as to meet the demands of busi
r.ess.
In conclusion Butler paid his amendment
provided that the greenbackâ the patriot
ic friend of the people â the kind of money
that did not dc-sert the people when
trouble came, fhouid be used as money ln-
Btead of gold or silver. In five years, he
said, the national debt could be extin
puished. This plan was not met with fa
vor by those who control the finances of
the Government, but he believed it would
he best for the people. The Senate took
up the calendar and passed the following
bills:
To encourage enlistment In the navy by pro
viding successful applicants with an outfit
vaiued at Hi.
To srox'ide for the examination of certain
offi-e.rs of the navy and to reipilaie promotions
In the navy.

WITH AN INJUNCTION
Rules Against the Sale of United
Verde Property a Month After
It Has Taken Place.
NEW YORK. Feb. 12.â The appellate
division of the Supreme Court on Friday
last handed down a decision restraining
United States Senator Clark of Montana
and the directors of the United Verde
Copper Company from selling th*> mines
and other property belonging to the cor
poration. As a matter of fact the sale
took place on .January 9 last, Just a
month before the decision of tha appel
late division was handed down, bo that its
ruling Is practically valueless.
The decision was upon an appeal from
an order rendered by Justice Glldensleeve
In special term, vacating an Injunction
obtained by Professor George A. Tread
well, a shareholder in the company, re
straining the company from selling the
property on the ground that the interests
of the minority shareholders would be
Mcrifieed. It was alleged that, under a
scheme, of reorganization prepared by the
directors, the company was to cease to be
a New York corporation and become a
West Virginia company. The reason for
this change was, it was stated, to avoid
the heavy taxation imposed ln this State
as the Montana laws inflict a large as
sessment on all mining porperty in that
country-

Bank Boldly Robbed in
New Mexico.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 12.â This afternoon
B. C. Bowman, a banker at Las Cruces,
N. Mex., telephoned to this city that his
bank had been held up by two unknown
men at 2 o'clock and robbed of $3000.
The robbers rode into town and hitched
their horses at the Rio GrandeHotel, on the
opposite side of the. street. Then they
crossed over and entered the bank, cover
ing Cashier Freeman and his young lady
bookkeeeper with six-shooters. The cash
ier was forced to open the safe and the
men took all the available cash, amount
ing to $3000. They then quietly- left the
building with the warning to those within
to keep quiet.
Mounting their horses they rode toward
the Organ Mountains, fifteen miles away.
Twenty minutes later Sheriff Garrett and
five deputies took the trail, and It is be
lieved that the outlaws will be rounded
up in a short time. A fight is almost sure
to result if the fugitives do not surrender.

TO PUNISH MEN
OF THE CLOTH
Bill Presented in the
French Chamber.
PARIS, Feb. 12.â 1n the .Chamber of
Deputies to-day the Premier, M. Wal
deck-Rousseau, Introduced a bill modify
ing the present law providing punishment
In the case of ministers of religion who
publicly censure or criticize ln any way
public authorities. Formerly only ban
ishment could be Inflicted, but the new
bill explains that the severity of the old
measure rendered the law inoperative, ao
the present bill provides imprisonment
varying from a fortnight to two years
for general offenses and detention in case
of direct provocation, disobedience of the
laws or armed revolt. The bill will thus
give the Government an arm to punish
its clerical opponents, without the ex
treme measure of exile, and will enable
It to punish attacks such as that of the
Archbishop of Alx, Monsignor Gouthe-
Soulard, who wrote a letter of encour
agement to the Aasumptlonist . fathers
on the dissolution of their order by the
Correctional .Tribunal. ,
The bill. -at the request of the Gov
ernment., was referred to a committee.
Several Deputies announced their lnten
tWin to interpellate the Government re
garding the Martinique, troubles, -wlshinc
to throw the responsibility on its colonial
policy. M. Denisi-Guelbort, representing
the . island of Martinique, declared this
policy would lead' to civil wax. The Pre

M. Firman-Faure, anti-Semite, repre
senting the island of Martinique," asked
what were the* Government's intentions
in the event of the possible intervention
of Italy In South ' Africa by replacing
British troops in the Soudan with her own
soldiers. Â¦ â¢
M. del Casse replied that the Govern
ment could not accept Interpellations on
the possible intentions of foreign .gov
ernments which were devoid of all proba
bility. The present moment, he added,
was one for vigilance, ri"ot speeches, and
there waÂ« nothing to Justify a uselssand
perhaps dangerous discussion.
The Chamber decided to postpone the
interpellation until after the budget de

JACK O'BRIEN TRAINING FORHIS GO WITH JACKSON.
THERE will be a decidedly warm
fistic argument in Woodward's Pa
vllion to-morrow night between.
"Jack" O'Brien of Philadelphia and
a. colored pugilist known as "Younvj
Peter Jackson;" Both men are ln
perfect condition to go the twenty rounds
at a fast clip, and devotees of the boxing
game are certain to witness a good battle.
The fight will be given under the auspices
of the National Club, and this alone pre
sages a good exhibition.
O'Brien has prepared for the contest; at
Blanken's Six-Mile House, while his dusky
opponent has fitted himself at the Inple
ride House. The Philadelphia lighter
claims that he is in better condition than
he was when he fought Al Neill and can
hit harder. He said yesterday that the
heavy bag, which he adopted from "Kid"
McCoy, has had a tendency to develop his
punching powers and has strengthened his
hands and forearms.. He gave a short ex
hibition with the new bag to show how It
has Improved him. O'Brien laughs at the
stories going around that the heavy bag
retards his speed as a boxer, and proved
it by going three swift rounds with Jimmy
Lawler, who, although much lighter, is a
worthy opponent. The bout became so
rapid that Trainer Edwards had to cau
tion both men repeatedly. O'Brien will do
some light work to-day and then rest until
the contest. He is as hard as nall3 and
feels certain that he can withstand Jack
son's smashes.
"Biddy" Bishop, the colored man's train
er and manager, has as much confidence
in Jackson winning as the latter himself.
During the past two weeks the colored
man has Indulged, in the hardest kind of
work in preparation for a gruelling con
test. Yesterday he was given four rounds
at the punching-ball, five hundred sklp3
with the rope, and four lively rounds with
a middle-weight named Nichols. Jackson
showed himself a merciless boxer, and re
peatedly had his opponent pleading for
jess punishment. Jackson showed in his
work that he is sensitive to the remarks
of people around him â a bad quality In a
prize-lighter. He Is likely to lose his head
at any stage of the fight and leave him
self, open to a vital blow. Peter Is in
pplendid condition and expects to repeat
his victory over Tom Tracey by sending
the Philadelphian into dreamland.
Jack Kitchen has been chosen to referee
the bout.
Jimmy Reilly and "Doc" Flynn will fur
nish an appetizer for the main bout. Tlwy
will box ten rounds for a decision, as will
also Toby Irwin and Jack McMahon.
PLANS TO CHECK THE
GROWING TRUST EVIL
Statesmen and Political Economists
Suggest Remedies at the Chicago
Conference.
CHICAGO. Feb. 12.â T0-night at the
close of the first day's proceedings of the
antl-truÃt conference called by the Na
tional Anti-Trust League good progress
had been made with the set speeches, of
which a dozen or more were delivered.
The resolutions committee was busy this
' afternoon and to-night. While the main
.body of the delegates was listening to the
1 fpteches at Central Jdusic Hall a set of
resolutions was formulated by the com
mittee covering the following points: Gov
ernment ownership cf all railways and
telegraph lines; the abolition of all spe
cial privileges by legislative enactment;
placing on the free list all trust goods.
and direct legislation by petition from the
people.
The discussion in committee was car
lied out on these lines. An amendment
was offered for the taxation of ail fran
chises, but was voted down on the ground
that such action . would simply legalize
â¢ special privileges. '
President Lockwood cf . thÂ© execeutlve
committee called the meeting to order. He
eald in part: ;
Twer.ty-eight years aÂ«o there gathered at the
little town of Frar.klln. Jutt as we have-gath
ered liere, the representative men 01-.tbe dye
' 011-prududr.g counties of Western Pearisylvanla
â gathered to protect, aye, and to revolt against
that snfaiTioun thing known a* the South Im
pruvement Company's commit with the five
trunk railways. That contract rave to the men
who a:terwarj cremtU the (standard Oil Con;
j*cy a ratal* or drawback oi more than Jl
to barrel tin evÂ«-ry barrel of oil >-hlpped from -the
oil region of I'ennsj lvania, w;uthÂ«r shipj>ed by
the jJjuth Improvement Company or not. In
other Â«-ord>. the railway curuj-aales contracted
to take ir. .ire than fi a barrel from th*- inde
pendent producers and refir.ers of Pennsylvania
1:1 excessive freights and transfer It into the
rollers of the South Improvement Company.
The people of the oil rejriuns of Pennsylvania
went into revolt and defied thi* railroad power.
They declared tiat the eijuai rights, of the peo
jie o\er the highways of tho country khould
cot be destroyed, that the railway companies
must ship .<!Â¦Â¦ .; *-<iual terms t'j every American
citizen, that the d:scriminatlLa contracted lor
by the t>.;uth Improvement O-mpany contract
thej- would not submit to. They would tear up
the railroad tracks and burn their bridges
first.
That little band of determined men, backed
by the mighty power of rifcht. rocked that old
KeyMcne state to her center. They went be
fore the lÂ«llllslliu, then :n session, and de
nianded and secured the repeal cf the South
Improvement Company's charter, and thÂ« life
of that corporation, a creature of the State.
vas snuifed out junt a* any corporation life
can be scuffed out whenever tht public welfare
erica:. i> it. For "The public wellare-is the su
preme law."
The mighty power of right against wrong
which shook the old State of Pennsylvania in
1N72 and forced the repeal of the South Im.
i.rove-ment Company* tharter will chake the
republic or fiat's in 1K;O. ThÂ«* mighty tower
of the American ballot focused upon the wrong
of monopoly, focused upon th*. laws by which
El>ecial privilege* have been granted will wipe
- out the wrong Â«:i>l i jrfr frcni the statute books
all *;>ecial pi-ivileget. Ip from all of the cen
turies, up frcm all of the sacrifices of all of
tbe patriots, heroes and martyrÃ of the East
haÂ» come thiÃ Government of our* based ui>on
-the equal r.Ehts of man. If we tall, liberty is
luut forever. There U no virgin soil, no un
broken wilderness in which to plant the setrJ
of liberty ucaia as our fathers planted it.
But we will not fall. This Government of
and by and for the people muit not po down
into that awful nigrht of an oligarchy of cpr
pcrate wealth. The old revolutionary spirit is
not dead. Out of its long sleep it IÂ» awakening
with newness of lite, with ftrencth sufficient
for the reformation. This American republic
Is founded upon the th>Ufcht of the equal rights
of man. upon the thought that every little boy
and every little girl starting; out upon life's
highway niifrht look up in the inorniriÃ. the
morning of life, with knowledge that there Is
no r*a-:e of honor, prestige or fame which they
rr.lpht not reach; that nothing but God-given
advantages could stand between them and the
highest round of the ladder it human attain
ments. But let this trust-monopolizing process
go on, and mark the change; then every little
boy and every' ! little girl born intÂ» this land
under the rtarÂ» and stripes, except a favored
few, will be born into a condition of slavery,
the worst the world has ever known. With
even' resource of our great land monopolized
by corporate "capital, and raan, man made in
the likeness of God. chained to the rock, help
less while th!e vulture of monopoly Is feeding
opon his vitals. God forbid that my children
or their c>*ccndantf- 6hall be subject to euch
condition as this. God grant that the children
of America shall not be subject to such a con
dition as that.
Now. what is the remedy? In my opinion,
one of the most important remedies is the
national owt.ership of the railways of the coun
try, the highways. For I cay to you that there
is hardly a monopoly in Amtrica to-day that
heÂ« not "bt-en created and maintained by rail
way disrrimir.atiring. Establish e<juftl rates over
the railways ol the country, such as we would
cini>y under Government ownership, so that
every man can go to market with the products
of hU handiwork, with the products of nib
mill, or his mine, or his farm. Just as cheap
ef any other man, and monopoly will wither
away.
But how can this rÂ»frnn be brought about?
Only by the ballot. Only by the; organisation
of a great political power, independent of par
ty Independent of party Yx>ttt"r. strong enough
to' drive Iro!n public life the tools of monopo
lies and trusts and put In their places men
prompted by impulses for the public welfare.
Wben you "have flone this, the rest is easy.
Wpen you have puf tnto legislative halls and
Â«nator*ial chambers, into executive chairs and
upon Judicial benches the riftht kind of men,
hew long will monopolies last? Net long.
Mayor Harrison welcomed the delegates
on behalf of the city. He denounced
trusts Jn perieral as dangerous and threat
ening the integrity of the nation. The
time had <-<>mp. he ?aM. to do away with
trusts. Already, he continued, the Sen
ate of the United States had been reduced
to a small convention of the owners and
represent at ivf-s of trurts. A few yearn
more wou'.d hpe the House and judiciary
reduced to ihe Fame condition. In con-
elusion he called on the delegates to ed
ucate the people to elect a legislative body
to enforce wliatever tcheme they decided
upon for the abolition of the monopolies
and to elect an executive with enough
patriotism to enforce the laws formu
lated.
Former Judge Prentiss of Illinois waa
elected temporary chairman and addressed
the convention. He said:
We rm:st arouse tha people aad teach tehm
that, in trvth as well as ln theory, the Gov
ernmptn of the United States bflonrs to them;
that they are the sovereigns of the country;
that uj>cn them reets the responsibility of root
lr.tr out the monoi>ohes, and. ere long, they will
find: r. remedy. We are here to decide upon
some remedy and then to co forth among the
people and convince them that they should
start the work. In my Judgment the trust evil
was caused by the failure of the people to rec
opnize what are their rights and what their
powers are.
Teach the people the Government la theirs â
that in them the remedy lies. Teach them that
the fundamental principles of the Declaration
of Independenceâ that all men have been cre
ated Â«-qualâ have been violated. These viola
tions are responsible tor the situation that con
fronts us to-day.
L*t us say that every, law which gives privi
leges to any class shall be wiped, oft the 'st&tut*
books.
General E. B. Flnley of Ohio was rec
ognized by the chair on a question of
personal privilege. He wished it under
stood, he said, that he was not here for
the purpose of aiding in the organiza
tion of a new political party. He feared
that such a construction might be placed
upon a portion of the speech of Presi
dent Lock wood in culling the conference
to order.
President Lockwood immediately ex
plained that he wae not here for the or
ganization of a new party. His belief
was that all men should, in the accom
plishment of the purpose before the con
ference, rise above the interests of party.
Franklin H. Wentworth of Chicago was
selected as temporary secretary. The fol
lowing were appointed temporary vice
presidents: Ex-Governor Altgeld of Illi

Captain }V. 8. Black of Illinois ad
dressed the conference on the trust ques
tion. He was enthusiastically received.
Following are extracts from his address:
The growth of conditions- under our Govern
ment, which take away from the masses who
toll' the hope of advancement alike for them
selves and their children; the economic Btatub
that, by the operation of the law of necessity
compelling the toiler to provide for himself and
tho6Â« dependent upon him, renders his condition
a fixed and unalterable condition and makes es
cape from the army of manual toilers a matter
dependent not ui>on Individual earnestness,
faithfulness and skill, but a matter resting In
the favor of the employer, thus making of the
toller a dependentâ these conditions are intol
erable to men understanding: and loving liberty
and resolved ui>on its maintenance above all
tilings. These conditions, if tamely tolerated,
are destructive alike of personal independence
and of free government.
The trur t evil, as it now exists among us. has
grown out of the cori>orate system, and. its
most malignant and baneful fruitage is the
debauching or public uentiment consequent upon
its j.ractices.
After arguing that the trusts have
"practically obtained the corrupt control
of every department of the Government,"
Mr. Black took up the question of reme
dies. He claimed that the trust was a di
rect outgrowth of corporations and their
practices, and that with no private cor
porations there would be no trusts. He
argued that the greatest restraint to the
abuses of the trust system would be not
publicity nor any special attempt at reg
ulation but such changes in the law as
would make every stockholder in any cor
porate enterprise civilly liable as a princi
pal or co-partner therein, and liable for
all criminal practices of agents or em
ployes committed under such circum
stances as to import guilty knowledge, or
from which criminal acts the shareholder
accepted benefit. He further argued that
corporations, being the creatures of State
law. no man had a right to demand the
f-nactment or continuation of such legisla
tion. He suggested as a method of
"checkmating the corrupting practices of
the managers and dependents of the cor
poration" the adoption of the Initiative
and referendum. Such reform, he be
lieved, could be adopted and put into op
eration, and once In operation the people
could by legislation which, the courts
could not annul dominate the whole ques
tion.
Governor Andrew Lee of South Dakota
was the first speaker of the afternoon.
Other speeches were made by H. S. Blge
low of Cincinnati. Jay D. Miller of Chi
cago. Dr. George Sherman of, Detroit, F.
\V. Elliott of Troy. Kana.. Representative

WASHINGTON. Feb. 12.â Four wit
nesses testified before the Senate Commit
tee on Privileges and Elections in. its in
vestigation of the election of Clark of
Montana to-day. They were N. R. Peeler,
a banker of Kallspel, whose evidence re
lated to" the bank account of Senator
Geiger; W. H. Crane of Butte, who was
called by the defense but who. before hÂ«
concluded, was stigmatized by them as a
witness for the prosecution; State Senator
C. W. Hoffman and John S. M. Neill, pro
prietor of the Helena Independent. Neill
had not concluded when the committee
adjourned for the day. He denied cate
gorically all the allegations of Whiteside
involving his name, and the latter's m-
Bertion concerning the use of corrupt
means to secure Clark's election.
David R. Peeler, Kalispel. Mont, was
the first witness. Before Peeler began
Senator Chandler again brought up the
question of the whereabouts of "Sweae
Murphy, who is wanted as a witness. The
Senator said that the man had been here
once, but had disappeared, and that ne
hoped that the newspapers would con
tinue their efforts to locate him. Chandler
said that he wanted to know the where
abouts of E. P. Woods and D. G. Warner.
He desired, he said, to have them all sum
moned. Hartman said he had been ton!
that Murphy had returned to Butte and
that the other two men were In California.
Peeler was questioned concerning 1 the ac
count of State Senator Geiger with his
bank, the First National, but he was not
able to throw much light upon the su.o
lect. He confirmed Geiger's statement
that he (Geiger) had borrowed $2JUO at
the bank, saying that Geiger had given
him a deed to property as security. The
witness was unable to give dates when
various loans had heen made, and he waa
taken sharply to task by Chandler for his
failure in this respect. He protested that
he was not trying to conceal anything,
but that he was simply unable to remem-
Peeler testified to conversations with
Whiteslde previous to the election tor
State Senator, in which the latter had
shown that he was a friend of Daly. He
also told of meeting Wellcome in Hejcna.
and said that he had told him that he oet
ter let Whiteside -alone, but he kaew
Whiteside was a Daly man.
The cross-examination brought out the
fact that Geiger had made small loans of
$200 or $300 previous to hits election to the
Legislature, but that he. had always m
such cases given Indorsed notes, whereas,
after the election, notes of from Uâ¢ to
$1300 were taken without Indorsement. Me
contradicted Geiger's statement that tins
Gelger note for $2300 had been canceled,
saying that he still held Geiger s prop
erty as security for it.
Peeler said that during the session of
the Legislature Representative Garr had
handed him a package of papers, but he
said that he had never told any one that
the package contained Garr"s "boodle.
Peeler said that Garr told him that the
package contained his election certificate
and a copy of a newspaper containing a
committee note. It was not inclosed in an
envelope, but was simply laid in a pigeon
hole in the safety vault of the bank, and
not locked up. He had returned the pack
age to Garr after the adjournment of the
Legislature. *â¢ ' â¢ 'Â¦- ' '' - --'
In the afternoon William H. Cochrane,
late editor of a weekly paper at Butte.
testified to two conversations with ilarK
Hewitt, a witness who testified for the
prosecution early in the case. He said
that in the first conversation Hewitt had
said that he knew nothing against Clark
or his following, but that ln the second,
which occurred last December, Hewitt
had been very bitter against Clark, inti
mating that he had failed to keep faith
in a mining deal. The witness told him that
he was coming to Washington to testify
in this case, and that, while he knew of
nothing against Clark, "there was lots of
time between Butte and Washington.
On cross-examination Cochrane eald he
had sold out his paper and had been pre
paring to go to the Klondike. Under
pressure, he said he had gone to see some
persons for the defense in this case,
among them Representatives Paul and
Metlen of Beaver Head County and Sen
ator Norris. He said that on one occa
sion, when standing in the outer office of
Jesse B. Root, partner of Wellcome in
Butte, he heard Root pay to some one in
the ofllce, whom he did not know:
"Here is the moneyâ take it: and after
you have testified we will pay you the bal-
He supposed this referred to the Clark
case, but he did not know.
This statement was evidently a sur
prise to the counsel for the defense, who
had called Cochrane and Foster in an ef
fort to impeach the testimony. The wit
ness said he had seen Campbell, coun
sel for the prosecution, since his arrival
ln Washington, but he had neither given
him money nor made him promises to give
him any. â ''-
"As it transpires." said Foster, "the
witness is not ours."
He added that Coehrane had made a
stronger statement to him before taking
the stand than he had made on the stand.
J S. M. Neill, proprietor of the Helena
Independent, covered a wide range in his
testimony, principally relating to State
Senator Whiteslde'a evidence. He said he
had known Whiteside for eight or ten
years and had been friendly to him. He
had several conversations with Whiteside
during and after the legislative elections.
At each of these meetings Whiteside had
expressed himself uniformly as friendly
to Clark.
"He told me," said the witness, "when
I met him first after the election, that of
the ninety-four members-elect of the
Legislature none was a more earnest sup
porter of Clark than himself, adding that
it was time to dump the Daly outfit."
Neill produced a letter from Whiteside,
asking him (Neill) to secure the services
of a lawyer.- by preference Mr. Day, to
represent him (Whiteside) in his contest
with Geiger for a seat In the Senate. He.
also told of meeting Whiteside about the
time of the meeting of the Legislature,
when he had invited him to his house to
meet C. W. Clark, son of the Senator.
This he had done at the request of White
side, who had said that he wanted to
personally meet either "W. A. Clark, or
his aon, or his brother. Joseph K. Clark.
In introducing the two gentlemen, he had
told C. W. Clark that Whiteside, in be
coming a supporter of his father, was
liable to subject himself to the "tyranny
of the Molly Magulres " who were re
lentless in their pursuit of every man
who opposed them, informing him at the
same time that Whiteside had the con
tract for the construction of a school
building at Butte, where the Trustees
were Daly men. He had told Charley

Clark that they would try to drive
Whiteside out after hi* voting. Charley
Clark had replied that "the Clarks are
good stayers themselves and had no fear
of being driven out." He had also at
the same time suggested to Charley Clark
that he should give- WMteside a chance
to bid upon the contract for putting up
a building the Clarka were contemplat
ing at Butte, and Clark had replied that
he would give him an even chance witlj
others. This was the last talk he had
had with Whlteskie.
Neill referred to the testimony of tha
witness, Watson, concerning a letter from
himself to T. J. Johns of Lewlston. Ha
produced a copy of thl3 letter from nia
impression book, promising to get the
book from which the cony was taken. It
proved to be a plea with Johns to make
an appeal to the Republican members or
the Legislature from that county to vote
for Clark for the Senate and prevent a

BATTLE AGAIN
OVER J. G. FAIR'S
MAP MILLIONS
Mrs. Craven's Mainte
nance Suit Begun.
After years of litigation Mm. Nettle R.
Craven Is now presenting her strongest
claim for a portion of the estate of the
late James G. Fair. Mrs. Craven's appli
cation for a family allowance from the es
tate of the dead millionaire was called for
hearing before Judge Troutt yesterday
morning. She was represented by Attor
neys Pence & Pence, DenÃon. Oatman A
.Denson and A. Ruef. while the interests
of executors of decedent's estate, Angus,
Goodfellow and Crothers, and the nelrs
ar.d devisees were guarded by Pierson -it
Mitchell, Rodgers, Paterson & Slack, Gar
ret W. McEnerney, Charles Heggerty,
George A. Knight. Lloyd & Wood and
Charles Wheeler. Ex-Chief of Police Lees
occupied a position near the line of de
fense, and several private detectives wan
dered back and forth through the cor
ridors.
When the case was called Judge Pater
son advanced the argument on behalf of
the heirs that as Mrs. Craven has not as
yet established her claim that she is Sen
ator Fair's widow she has no right to ask
for a family allowance. He said that the
claimant must first establish her widow
hood before her demand could be consid
ered.
The court conceded the cogency of Judge
Patersons theory, and the opening of the
afternoon session found Mrs. Craven on
the stand ready to proceed.
Attorney Lafe Pence made the opening
Ftaterr.ent on behalf of his client. Prior
to reading the pleadings and entering into
a discussion of the issues involved he
cpoke of the absence of W. W. Foote,
â¢whom it was thought would handle the
fight on behalf of Mrs. Craven.
"Mr. Foote has asked me to make his
apologies to court and Counsel for his ab
sence to-day and probably throughout the
trial," he said. "The deep domestic af
f.lctlon that has fallen upon him pre
cludes his taking any active part in any
trial now. His public engagements as one
of the Commissioners to the Paris Expo
sition had already become so pressing that
he had indicated to his colleagues hero
that he would not be able to appear with
us in this hearing, when suddenly, with
out warning, he was stricken by the bit
terest Borrow that ever falls to the lot of
man. He cannot come here. He cannot
assist us. We car.not help him. except
with the hope in which I know the
court and opposing counsel and ail
\\w bar and all the State will Join us that
light will soon break upon him as he
walks alone in the valley of the shadow
of death. It is a pity that so kindly a
heart should be hit so hard.
"Without saying more, you will under
ftand why he is not here to-day and ex
cuse him." We are Indeed sorry that he
cannot lÂ»o here to assume his wonted and
usual placo !n charge of the laboring oar."
Mr. Pence then proceeded to lay before
the court the claims of his client and the
law bearing on Â«Â»ach claim. The examin
ation of Mrs. Craven then began. She
told again the circumstances surrounding
her alleged marriage to Senator Fair by
contract In 1832. but did not reach the
circumstances alleged In the opening
statement that subsequently the marriage
was ratified by "an official legally quail
fled to perform the marriage ceremony."
Mrs. Craven was asked as to whether
or not she had shown the contract to a
third party, but her answer was excluded
by an objection made by Mr. McEnerney.
who contended that the exhibition of the
document, whether It was genuine or
forged, could rot bind the defendants. A
long argument followed, and finally Mr".
McEnerney was called to the stand that
his knowledge of the existence of a mem
orandum Jn which It Is alleged Senator
Fair made a note of his marriage to Mrs.
Craven might be taken advantage of. Mc-
Enerney. however, refused to answer the
question* of counsel on the ground that j
nil of his knowledge of the case at bar
was procured through- confidential sources
and he was protected from examination I
under the circumstances by statutory e.n-
Rotmcnt. Mr. McEnerney then left the
Ftand and the case went over until this
morning.

was dealt the Horton law to-night at the

of George Gardiner of Lowell, Mass., and
Jimmy Handler of Newark, N. J., who
were scheduled to box twenty-five rounds
at 152 pounds. Gardiner won in the third

The men had weighed in and everything
had proceeded far enough to enable cer
tain persons to place their money on the
Massachusetts boxer at 6 to 4. Handier
at first had been the favorite at 10 to 7,
and the sudden change in the betting was
a presage that something was wrong. The
crowd generally; however, was unable to
form a conclusion as to the reason, for
this until the men had shaped for tue
opening round. It was noticed that Hand
ler limped perceptibly, and It was learned
that he had for several days been suffer

was under a physician's treatment. The
Injury was caused by a blow from an

HIS CONSCIENCE
MADE McCORMICK
A UNIQUE JUROR
Agreed to a Verdict
and Recanted.
John T. McCormlck, president of the
California Artistic Metal and Wire Com
pany, of 30 First street, is not likely
to sit on any more Juries in the
United States "Circuit Court In this
city, if the publicly expressed opin
ion of Judge Bellinger has any weight
with the parties concerned in the. selection
of juries. Mr. McCormick is accused by
eleven fellow jurors of having recanted
at a critical moment and thereby plp.ced
them in an unpleasant position.
The case under consideration was that
of the Holt Manufacturing Company
against the Houser & Halnes Manufac
turing Company to recover $25,000 actual
damages, plus $75,000 exemplary damages,
and costs for an alleged infringement of
a patent on a machine known as "travel
ing thrashers." The trial ended on Fri
day afternoon, and the jury was sent out
to deliberate. Eleven jurors were not long
in deciding that the defendant was enti
tled to Judgment, but McCormack had
opinions of his own and clung to them
with so much tenacity that the jury re
mained out all night endeavoring to con
vince Mr. McCormlck he would confer a
boon upon eleven suffering fellow Jurors
if he would consent to see the matter as
they did. but it was of no use. McCor
mlck persisted in saying that' his con
science would not allow him to decide with
the majority. On Saturday they reported
to Judge Bellinger that they had been un
able to agree, but on account of the great
expense of the trial the court did not feel
justified in discharging the jury and try
ing the case over again. So he sent them
back to deliberate. - if ... .. '
They remained out all of Saturday night,
Sunday and Sunday night, and came Into
court at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon,
smiling as with the consciousness of a
great victory won. They . had prevailed
upon the obstinate Juror , to consent to a
verdict at last. A slip of paper was hand
ed to the clerk bearing the following
words:
"We; the Jury, find in favor of the de
fendant. We also find there was invention
in the use by the plaintiff of the adjusta
ble box and bracket in connection with
Jackshaft, as set forth In letters patent,
and sustain sections 4 and 7."
The order to poll the Jury was given,
and Juror McCormick arose and said that
he would not agree to the verdict. The
other Jurors said that he had. agreed to
it and that they had modified it into its
present form so as to suit Mr. McCor
mick's opinions. There was nothing left
for the court to do but. to decline to re
ceive the verdict, the Jury not being unan
imous, and to discharge. the twelve mem
bers from any further consideration of the
case. . â¢ Â¦ .
After this had been done Judge Belling
er remarked that he hoped that Mr. Mc-
Cormlck would never be accepted as a
Juror in the Circuit Court, or any other
court of Justice.
Judge Bellinger had a previous expe
rience with Juror McCormlck. The latter
was a member of the Jury In the case of
Jiro Harada vs. the Southern Pacific Com
pany. Harada Is a Japanese student, wl:o
attended the Alameda High School /aÂ« a
pupil. One day in October, 1898, he was
run over by a train at the intersection of
Park and Everett streets and Injured so
badly that It was found necessary to am
putate one leg and three. fingers, for the
loss of which Harada asked, the court to
award him $20,000 damages.. Harada rÂ»
celved a verdict for $5000. On the day aftÂ«Â»r
the verdict had been rendered McCormick
visited the Judge in his chambers and told
him that he had been unable to sleep be
cause his conscience troubled him on ac
count of the verdict. In which he had
acquiesced. He thought. that the Jap had
been negligent. But the verdict had been
accepted and It was then too late to do
anything in the premises. Some of the
Jurors in that case said afterward that
McCormlck was recalcitrant, and . that in
order to get him to agree with the ob
stinate eleven they had <. scaled ; down' the
amount of damages from $10,000 to $5000.

THE li!g Federal building on Wash
ington street and the Sub-Treasury
buildir.g on Commercial strt-e-t
buzzt d with scandal yesterday. The
subject was a sensational incident
that occurred at a civil service examina
tion- that took place last Saturday for the
position of chief clerk of the Sub-Treasury
in this city, a position paying $2400 per an
num. The fact that the temporary in
cumbent. Samuel Jacobs, was an appli
cant and appeared for examination and
that he is a brother of Assistant Treas
urer Jacobs has made busy tongues wag
with rumors of fraud or attempted fraud,
and protests and affidavits on both sides
are now on their way to Washington.
The story is to the effect that the packet
containing the questions to be propounded
to the applicants had been opened before
hand by Manuel Eyre, secretary of the
special Board of Civil Service Examiners,
and this fact gave rise to the report that
Mr. Jacobs was to be favored by the ex
aminers or some of them by being made
acquainted with the questions before the
examination took place.
The special boara appointed for the pur
pose of examining applicants consists of
Thomas Burns, Manuel Eyre and John T.
Lydon. all being attaches of the Sub-
Treasury. There were thirty-five ap
cants. only thirty of whom appeared for
examination before the board. Mr. Eyre,
as secretary of the board, had possession
of the examination papers sent by the
Civil Service Commission at Washington,
and after the class had been called to or
der he held up the packet and showing
the seal and twir.e on top of it said, "You
ccc the seal is unbroken; the package has
not betn opened."
Mr. Burns, a member of the board, de
clared that the package had been tam
pered with, for the twine of the lower
side had been cut and the packet had
teen resealed on that side with the seal
of the San Francisco Sub-Treasury. At the
eaxne time G. Andruss. one of the appli
cants, observed the same thing and pro
tested. Mr. Eyre then explained that he
had cut the twine by mistake a few days
before. He had been in the habit of re
ceiving several packets of that size end
thapr and not knowing that this particu
lar packet had anything to do with the
examination had cut the twine on Ihe un
der side. When he opened it and found
that it contained the questions to be asked
tt the examination he repealed the packet
without looking any further into its con
tents.
Mr. Andruss then filed a verbal protp*t
and the examination was proceeded with,
Mr. Andruss watching Samuel Jacobs so
fharply as to make that gentleman and
the board feel very uncomfortable. At
the expiration of about half an hour Mr.
Jacobs announced that he did not desire
to proceed any further with the examina
tion and that the board might consider
him out of It.
The clamor was so great that the board
yesterday prepared -affidavits to the effect
that no oily of their number had any Idea
of the contents of the packet and that It
was opened through mistake.
If the Civil Service Commission at
Washington should throw out the exam
ination Samuel Jacobs will have another
chance at the position, but if the exam
ination shall be declared legal he will have
lost the job through the peculiar mistake
of the secretary of the special board.
Mr. Burns said yesterday that he was
the first person to discover that the
packet had been opened and that he made
the announcement of that fact to the class
at once. Mr. Eyre swears that he did not
pry Into the contents of the packet, and
that as this was tha first time that he and
his colleagues had acted in that capacity
the mistake was natural and perfectly
innocent.
George H. Andruss., who claimed he was
the first to discover that the list of ques
tions had been tampered with, was much
perturbed last night when he learned that
the matter had gained publicity. He
seemed to think that all his efforts to
secure the place would now avail him.
naught, even though he should stand the
highest In the class of thirty candidates
which took the examination.
"Assistant Treasurer Jacobs picks the
successful man from the three who pass
the highest examination," he said, "and
if I should even be in the lead In the
contest my name will be mud when the
choice Is made.- if I am connected with
this trouble. If they <lo not throw me
down In Washington, they certainly will
in San Francisco.
"While I do not want to be put down
as a kicker, I must admit that I first
made the discovery that the list of ques
tions sent here from Washington had
been Juggled. The law provides that
when the package of questions comes
from Washington It is to be kept Intact
until the class which is to be examined
ia got together. It is then to be opened
by the examiners In the presence of all
of the candidates. This Is expressly
stated in a large- warning pasted on one
side of the package.
"When the package was brought out
before the class last Saturday I noticed
that it was sealed with the seal of the
San Francisco sub-treasury instead of
that at the department in Washington.
When I called the attention of the ex
aminers to the fact they became very
much arltated. and said that they had
opened the package by mistake. Then, to
allay suspicion, they said that they had
placed the roll of questions In a new
wrapper and scaled It up again with the
local seal. They all protested that no
person had secured access to the ques
tions, and were going to forward an af
fidavit to that effect to Washington.
â¢ "I did not make any charge qf fraud,
although Sam Jacobs, a brother of the
Assistant Treasurer at San Francisco,
was one of the candidates who took the
examination. There certainly was a big
chance for fraud, but I made no protest
and am not kicking now, because If I
did my chances as a candidate would be
ruined."

Exposed What Had Been Done and Samuel
Jacobs Withdrew From the Class.

DUNNE'S SCHEME
IS LOOKED INTO
BY THE POLICE
Solicits Money to Bet
on Races.
BIG RETURNS ARE PROMISED
SEDUCTIVE CUtCTTLAB, BRINGS
MANY REPLIES.
"Edward Dunne and wife, Chicago," In
a plain business hand, appears on the Pal
ace Hotel register, under date of Wednes
day, February 7. The register shows also
that the owners of the names were as
signed to one of the most luxurious apart
ments In that hostelry.
Edward Dunne spent yesterday after
noon at the Tanforan racetrack In the
company of a police detective, explaining
some matters that had caused him to
come under the eye of the officers. The
police-accused Dunne of trying to estab
lish in this city a money-making scheme
similar to that which landed Miller, New
York's sensational swindler, behind the
bars, the difference being that Dunne usea
the horse races instead of stocks as the
basis of his game, and that he succeeded
in convincing the officers that they could
not fasten any crime upon him.
Before coming to this city Dunne mailed
all over the East a seductive circular
asking those to whom it was addressed to
send him money to bet for them on a
horse to be started on February 13 and
which would sell at about 15 or 20 to 1,
nothing less than remittances of $10 to be
accepted. This, the circular continued,
was a chance to win from $500 to $1000
clear on a bet of $50, Dunne's commission
to be a fourth.
The circular sets forth that Dunne Is
chairs and opened business there, his
name and an invitation to "walk in" be
ing painted on the door. Saturday after
noon Dunne and two men who were work-
Ing with him stuffed the contents of two
valises full of circulars into the mail box
downstairs.
Upon his return from the Tanforan
track yesterday the police told Dunne he
could go his way. Their belief was that
the man never bet the money sent to him
or at least that he bet only a small por

Dunne was found in his apartment at
the Palace last 'night. He la a smooth
faced, rotund, smiling and keen-appear
ing individual. Though advertised as "a
trainer for twenty years." he said he was
but 33 years of age and he looks like any
thing but a horse trainer.
"I can't be arrested on any charge
whatever." he said, confidently. "All I
do is to receive money to bet on commis
sion. I've done this in all the big cities.
The detective saw me bet JIOO to-day. I
placed it on Tizona three ways. He came
in fourth. I get through the mails about
$300 or $400 a month, and win about $2500 or
$3000.
"I own Tizona. Tradalium and
Forbes. Tradalium Is worth about 30
cents. The others are good horses.
I bought Forbes In Chicago last sum

name of my trainer, A. O. Himmel

horse I am going to place all the money
on to-morrow. I've received about $400
since I came here Wednesday, and It all
goes on him. Why. to prove I'm square,
look at these telegraph blanks. I'm get

THE BAGDAD RAILWAY.
I ; ROM Berlin comes the report of the publica-
J tion in that city of a work entitled "From
*Â¦ Mediterranean to Persian Gulf," which discusses
the various problems involved in the construction of
the so-called "Bagdad railway," a concession for
which was recently granted by the Sultan of Turkey
to a German syndicate. As the book is the produc
tion of Baron von # Oppenheim, an official of the Ger
man Government at Cairo, it is regarded as a work of
no little importance. It is, in fact, something of an
official outline of what the Germans purpose to ac
complish in the enterprise.
It has been deemed well nigh certain that the rail
way would be constructed from a point on the
Bo?phorus through the valley of the Euphrates to
Bagdad, and from that point to the Persian Gulf.
Baron Oppenheim, however, after discussing the
various routes which have been under consideratiqn,
comes to the conclusion the road should start from n
port on the Mediterranean and proceed along the
valley of the Tigris instead of the Euphrates. The
Tigris route will be longer than the other, but it is
richer, more thickly populated, has more centers of
important trade, and is, moreover, the route taken. by
most of the caravans to and from the Persian Gulf.
From this it appeals, the new railway will be run
from Konieh to Biredjik and Mardin, and thence
along the Tigris to Nisibin and Mosul, finally passing
among the low hills of Kurdistan to Bagdad.. The
notion of planting German colonists along this line
has evidently been abandoned. The Sultan, it seems

Even decent Democrats must b*> disgusted with the attempt of the San Fran

rejoicing over the splendid triumph of clean politics the journalistic polecat of Snr.

HUMBOLDT STANDARD.
Such baseless charges from n sheet so thoroughly discredited even by the bet
ter element of the Democratic party will not deceive the people. The Examiner
is an unclean bird. It did its best to compass the defeat of Senator White when
he was seeking the honor of a seat in the United States Senate, but its opposition
helped rather than hurt Stephen M. White. Its charges of bribery and corrui
tion, of collusion between Herrin and the Sugar :Trust, will be taken foÂ«* vhat
they really are: the fulmlnations of a disappointed mischief-maker and marplot.

TREATY HYSTERICS.
THE Xew York Journal has concluded to defeat
the Nicaragua canal by hysterics. The new
treaty, modifying the Clayton-Bulwer conven
tion and enabling the immediate construction of the
canal by this Government, proposes to neutralize the
canal and that this country shall abstain from fortify
ing it. The militant spirit of the Journal wants not
only the large expenditure needed for construction,
but also the large outlay required to fortify it. To do
tins we must first acquire sovereignty from Nica
ragtta and Costa Rica, for one country cannot build
fortifications under the jurisdiction of another.
When we acquire sovereignty and proceed to fortify

fliore involved, our national vitals and must there

lore plant there a system of defense as great as re

hysterics has discovered that unless we fortify any

ration or combination of nations stronger than our
,
selves will take the canal. As there is no special vir
tre in canal fortifications, making them more im

prcgnaOle than ?.ny other similar works, it may occur
to our non-hysterical people that anybody stronger
than we are will take the canal any wav, fortifications
When James Buchanan was Secretary of State he
hsd some ideas about an isthmian canal and left them
0:1 record to the effect that the canal should not only
be neutralized, but a wide zone at each terminus
t!:ould, by international agreement, be neutral also,
so that no nation or combination of nations could
possibly lie in wait to prey upon commerce destined
for that waterway.
Discouraging as present conditions may be, a civil
ized nation like this should still respect the prin
ciples of civilization and should practice that self
respect and good faith which go with a proper expres
tion of confidence in the self-respect and good faith
of other nations.
The hysterical policy of the Journal finally leads to
the dispatch of a insn-of-war with every merchant
ship to convoy her from the port of departure to her
destination lest some one. stronger than we, shall
return to barbarism by violating neutral obligations
/.Â«d making her a prize on the high seas. That is to
say. the Journal is fearful that the whole world is
about to adopt piracy, to disregard treaty obligations
and arm and equip for everlasting conflict.
The canal when buift will be of little use to us un
less, it is a neutral highway for the commerce of all
nation* and it is a pitiful exposure of ourselves to
declare that no cargo shall traverse it except under
ti:e threat of our guns.

BRITISH DISCONTENTS
IF the old saying: "The shallows murmur, but the
deeps are dumb," be a maxim of universal appli
cation, then at this time very nearly all the people
of the British islands must be shallow, for almost all
of them are murmuring. In the sound of their mur
murs two complaints are heard above all others â
first, that the military censorship of the news from
South Africa is unworthy of the British nation, and
second that the army has been proven to be a social
rather than a military organization and that the
troops suffer disasters in battle because their officers
are ignorant of the art of war.
Against the censorship, some of the strongest papers
in London have begun a veritable crusade, the Times
leading the way. The Westminster Gazette, in com
menting upon it, says: "It is one of our traditions
that we seek neither to belittle our reverses nor to
magnify our victories; surely it is a tradition worth
guarding and worth adhering to. It is right that no
news of the movements or disposition of troops nor
any details which might assist the enemy should be
permitted to reach this country, yet we see daily that
certain details which might very easily be of assistance
to the Boers are permitted to come home, while other
information is withheld which would relieve thou
sands of anxious hearts at home while adding nothing
to the information of our enemy. We also see
shameful insinuations against the honor of individuals
allowed to come home over the wires and we see let
ters published giving particulars which do no good
to any one here, but might conceivably be of great
assistance to our foe. We. see also long cables de
scribing in the greatest detail trifling successes, thus
lending them a fictitious importance, while the re
sult of, important operations is concealed from us at
home long after it must have been perfectly well
known to the Boers."
The truth of these statements is familiar to every
one who has followed the reports from South Africa
with sufficient attention to form an intelligent opinion
concerning them and it is not strange the British peo
ple, in their eagerness for news and their anxiety
about friends, should feel a deep and well-founded
indignation against the censors who, without any
valid reason, deprive them of the information they
desire.
The clamor against the censorship, however, is
not greater nor severer than that against the system
of army administration which has placed British regi
ments under the command of men who sought the
rank solely for the social standing it gave them.
The officers have proven themselves to be brave, for
they have not shirked the duty of leading their men
into action, but they have also shown themselves
wholly lacking in military skill and resources. They
have been outgeneraled on the field in every fight
and have fallen into trap after trap set for them by
their enemies. Thus, without gaining any success
whatever, they have lost more men than it was'be
lieved would be lost in the whole course of the war.
The censorship will doubtless hold on its way until
the end of the war unless Roberts prove a wiser man
than.Buller and give orders to relax it, but the pres
ent system of providing officers for the army is
doomed. The popular sentiment now aroused against
it will not lightly pass away. Great Britain may lose
the Transvaal, but she will undoubtedly gain army
reform by way of consolation.
San Diego rainmakers should not be discouraged
even if they fail in their present attempt to compel
moisture from above. In his speech during the
Union League reception to Senator-elect Bard
General W. H. L. Barnes gave promise of needed re
lief. He said that at the conclusion of this year's
campaign he would be at San Diego weeping with
Grant.
THE GRAZING LEASES.
TIIE^E seems to be an extraordinary condition
of indifference in the: West to the effort now be
ing made by the Interior and Agricultural de
partments to protect the grazing property of the Gov
ernment by a leasehold control. \
The grazing lands west of the ninety-ninth meridian
have been occupied without law and exhausted with
out foresight until their forage is greatly impaired and
the resource of the country for a beef food supply
and for our great export of that meat is rapidly dis-
The statistics of Wyoming will serve as an example
and results found there are general throughout the
grazing region.
In 18S6 Wyoming had on the ranges 1,280,916 head
of cattle with a value of $32,022,900 and 518,466 sheep
of a value of $1,072,188. The exhaustion of the cattle
food was rapid. As their forage disappeared sheep
increased to destroy what was left, so that in 189S
the cattle had declined to 688,092 head, with a value
of $16,300,696, and sheep had increased to 1,940,021,
with a value of $5,714,332. There was left therefore a
total property value on these exhausted ranges of
$22,102,028 to replace the total of $33,095,088 that was
there twelve years before.
It will be seen that the substitution of a sheep value
for a cattle value is that of a less for a greater. The
loss of cattle value in that twelve years was $15,632,
204 and the substituted gain in sheep value was only
$4,652,144!
It is estimated that a sheep equivalent for cattle is
ten sheep to one steer, so that to replace the full
value of 1886 would require the presence of 13,000,000
sheep. As an officer of the Agricultural Department
truly says: "Thirteen million sheep would transform
Wyoming into a cloud of dust." The same officer
adds: "Here and throughout the West are large areas
cf once fine grazing lands which to-day' will not sup
port one steer; for not merely have the grasses been
eaten to the ground year after year, but they have
been actually killed out and supplanted by other vege
tation that stock will not eat. The writer has trav
ersed mile after mile of such country along the Lower
Dcs Chutes in Oregon. From every part of the arid
West rumors of such denudation are heard and from
many sections the reports are reliable and precise.
For obvious reasons the local newspapers say little
or nothing about the matter, but the fact that such
and such a range is 'played out' is a matter of com
mon knowledge in Western communities. I do not
wish, for the mere purpose of supporting an argu
ment, to draw too black a picture of the decadence
of Western grazing lands, but I do wish to assert as
strongly as possible my belief that if the laws govern
ing our arid lands remain unchanged lawlessness
will continue, the destruction of private property and
human life will go on, the prosperity of communities
will be lessened and one of the rich resources of the
nation will be wasted. It must, however, in fairness
be stated that, bad as conditions now are, the remedy
is easy and that, if soon applied, recovery will be
quick. If an area of overgrazed land be fenced in
and stock be kept off, the grass, if not actually killed,
will after a time regain its original vigor â in some
cases in a year or two, in others in five years. Hun
dreds of instances may be found where a small area
of private land, fenced and not overstocked, main
tains its full forage crop, while outside the fence
there is practically no grazing whatever. In many
cases stockmen or companies have acquired titles, by
purchase of homesteads, of tracts of watered land
covering large territories and by fencing them in they
have been able, to control the grazing lands of those
regions. No others can bring their cattle,- because
they can get no water for them. The resident cattle
cwner, therefore, while without legal control of the
land outside his fences has de facto the exclusive use
of it. He accordingly manages it as if it were his
own property, that is, he does not overstock it. As a
result the grass crop is maintained at its highest limit
of continued productiveness."
FYom its knowledge of these facts the Agricultural
Department concludes that these ranges should not
be sold to private ownership, that they should remain
a part of the public domain, but that their wasteful
reduction to desert conditions should be prevented
by giving stockmen a leasehold control, properly safe
guarded and under Federal supervision, to the end
that their forage may be renewed, even by reseeding if
necessary, and that the grazing business, now going
swiftly and lawlessly to its final end, be furnished the
protection of law and permanence.
We cannot conceive why this, should not be de
sirable for the stockmen. They should seek law, or
der and permanence for their occupation and there
fore they should at once second the highly intelligent
and necessary purposes sought by the Agricultural
and Interior departments. It is not often that the in
fluence of two of the great Cabinet departments is
combined in securing an economic result that depends
on legislation. Whether they see" it or not the result
h in the proper interest of the stockmen. But the
consumers of beef food, the tanners and leather trades
have also a vital interest and if the stockmen con
tinue indifferent these classes should see to it that
the supply of raw material is not cut off by the con
tinuation of an unwise and lawless policy.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13. 1900.
will settle a number of Mohammedan agriculturists
on this territory, with the object of raising cotton
and grain. Baron yon Oppenheim has no doubt that
when once irrigation canals from the Euphrates and
the Tigris have been built, modern Mesopotamia will
rival ancient Babylon in fertility and riches. He pre
dicts for the railway a brilliant future. In a short
time the passenger and goods traffic must enormously
increase, and, besides, mails to the East will certainly
be dispatched by this line. v.
Since the Baron obtained the data on which his
book is based the situation has % been changed mi
terially by the concessions' which the Persian Gov
ernment has granted to Russia in consideration of an
important loan. Those concessions virtually give
Russia a paramount influence in. Persia, and conse
quently a control of the railways and the ports of that
country. What the Germans will do to avoid the
difficulty remains, to be. seen. It is hardly likely they
will undertake to Â¦construct- a railway whose eastern
terminus will be under Russian control, and yet it is
certain, they cannot very well end their Bagdad road
anywhere except upon some part of the Persian Gulf.
Diplomacy, of course, may find a way of arranging
the matter to the satisfaction of all concerned, but it
is clear that when once the Bagdad road is con
structed Germany will have to be counted as an
Asiatic power, and Russia and Great Britain will not
have the game altogether to themselves.

6CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP.
Hon. Frank J. Murasky Speaks to
the Young Men's Institute.
Hon. Frank J. Murasky delivered the
second lecture of the course being given
by the Young Men's Institute at the Met
ropolitan Temple last night. The section
of the course was that allotted to Cathol
icism and conduct, and the speaker chose
for his subject "The Christian Citizen."
Professor R. J. Harrison presided at the
organ, and after a recitation. Colonel J.
J. Tobin made a . few introductory re
marks, introducing the speaker, of the
evening. Hon. Frank Murasky sketched
in brief the gradual development of the
citizen from the earliest time. .Nothing
in history, he said, seems, to have been
so slow as the civilization of mankind.
The arena of the Colosseum was perhaps
the worst spectacle of human depravity
that the world has ever seen, and Just
when the zenith of all that was brutal
and demoralizing was reached the worldâ
the Roman worldâ was startled by the
birth of Christ. This event was the one
event that had more to do with the civil
ization of the world than any other In
cident recorded in history. The true
catholicity shown by the disciples, the
utter disregard of nationality that dis
tinguished the early Christian, did more
for the cause .of true citizenship than all
that had preceded it.
"We have improved," said the speaker,
"but it has been a slow, process. Grad
ually the spirit of that great and lowly
Nazarene has leavened the mass of hu
manity, and is still bringing the world to
a sense of true Christian citlzen&hip."
The lecture bureau committee consists
of: Theodore J. Savage, A. F. St. Sure,
Rev. Philip O'Ryan, George A. Stanley.
William F. Aggeler. S. R. O'Keefe. John
Ril*Â»y. Samuel Raskins,. R. H. Hammond,
F. J. Driscoll and John J. O'Toole.

Eion to 1.i09 Gatos. Special arrangements
have been made to run trains from Third

tention of the managers to make the pic

ILLUSTRIOUS NOBLES
OF THE MYSTIC SHRINE
TWO NOTABLE EVENTS IN MEM
ORY OF ORIENTAL PEOPLE.
I ;
Grand Procession Next Wednesday
and a Theater Party and a Ban
quet to Ladies Next Week.
The Illustrious Nobles of Islam Temple,
Ancient Arabic Order of the Mystic
Shrine, have arranged for two events, one
next Wednesday and one for the follow
ing Wednesday. The first will be a cele
bration In memory of Hafiz Mohammad
Shems ed Deen, the finest lyric poet in
the Orient. It will also be the feast of
Eedool Azra. held in great veneration by
all good Moslems, and it will be in Golden
Gate Hall, when there will be the pro
cessions of the Kisweh and of the Mah.
mccl, on which occasion there will
be. for the benefit of all nobles assem
bled, a realistic representation, a glorious
apotheosis and the mirage of the Inverted
fountain of Zem Zem. It will also be for
the benefit of a number of novates who
have decided to take a pilgrimage to the
land of Oriental splendor. This event will
be followed by a grand banquet, at which
It is expected there will be about 400 pres
ent.
The event on tho night of the 21st and
morning of the 22d will be a theater party
and banquet in' honor of ladies who have
been Invited to partake of the hospitality
of the Shriners. 3 It will be In memory
of Al Azra Ayeesha. the daughter of
Aboo Bakar and third or favorite wife of
Mohammad. The Temple has secured for
Its exclusive use for that night the Al
cazar Theater, and then it has secured
the exclusive use of a rotisserle, where
the banquet tables will be laid. At the
theater no gentleman who is not a Noble
will be admitted, and each Noble will ap

ALLEGED MURDERERS TO
PLEAD SELF-DEFENSE
PRELIMINARY HEARINGS OF
DILLON AND NARJOT.
Further Corroboration of the State-
ment That Charles Joyce Fired
. First at the Ex-Policeman.
The preliminary examination of ex-Po
llceman Thomas H. Dillon, charged with
the murder of Charles Joyce, grocer, at
Seventeenth and Castro streets on Janu
ary 15, was continued before Judge Con.an
yesterday. The plea of self T defense was
further strengthened by the evidence r jf
James Downing, a witness for the prose
cution, who corroborated the testimony of
Witness Reedy to the effect that Joyce
fired two shots at Dillon before the latter
returned his fire. Michael Begley testified
that three days before the shooting Jojve
borrowed a revolver from him, as he said
he expected trouble and wanted to be pre
pared. Sergeant Lionel Shaw and De
tectives Fitzgerald and Graham testified
to making Dillon's arrest, and a continu
ance was granted till this afternoon.
The preliminary examination of Ernest
Narjot,. charged with the murder of J.
O'Neill Gleason, bartender In Stanley's
Grotto, Turk and Mason streets, was con
tinued before Judge Fritz yesterday after
noon. William Daly, the man who was
with Minnie Hamilton prior to the shoot
ing, testified that after the woman ran
out of the box Narjot came up to him and
knocked him down. He Jumped to his feet
and there was a mix-up. Gleason came
and separated them and witness stepped
into a room. Just then he heard a shot,
and on looking out saw Gleason lying on
the floor. V. S. Meade, the colored waiter
in the. grotto, repeated the testimony he

Growing on Public Streets.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
awarded the contract for removing gar
bage from the public schools to Antonio

vegetables. The club petitions that the
vegetables now growing on blocks on
Joost avenue. Hamburg street. Mangels

BUNGLING PIECE OF FORGERY.
Dr. John H. Decker Is Charged With
Passing a Worthless Check.
Dr. John H. Decker, a dentist, who has
an office at Sixth and Howard streets, is
locked up In the City Prison charged with
passing a fictitious check.
Decker owed a saloon-keeper named W.
A. Sullivan $40 and gave him a check for
the amount, which he claimed he had re
ceived from the manager of The Call. The
check was signed "S. W. Leake," whereas
the name of the manager of The Call is
W. S. Leake.
Sullivan presented the check for pay
ment at the Columbian Bank, in the
Spreckels building, a few days ago, and
was promptly informed that the paper
was worthless. The matter was at onoe
reported to the police by the bank official:*,
and Detectives Tom Gibson and Harry
Reynolds were detailed to make an investi
gation. They located Decker yesterday
afternoon on Howard street and took him
into custody. After being put through
the sweating process he admitted his guilt.
Decker Is the individual who a short
time ago betrayed an escaped criminal to
the police for a monetary consideration.
He was taken Into the confidence of sev
eral friends of the fugitive, and after be
ing told his hiding place went to pollre
headquarters and offered to betray him
for $50. This offer was accepted, and aftÂ«r
receiving the money Decker took the de
tectives to the house where the escape
was In hiding and assisted them in cap
turing him. It is said that Decker has
been in the habit of uttering forged
checks, but always managed to escape ar

BRITISH VESSEL
HERE TO LOUD A
CARGO OF MULES
The Animals May Go
to South Africa.
NEW GOVERNOR FOR TUTUILA
WILL LEAVE HERE ON THE
PHILADELPHIA.
The British steamer Victorious, which
arrived from British Columbia early yes
terday morning, is somewhat of a mys
tery. She was partly loaded with lum
ber at Chemainus, B. C. and comes here
ostensibly to take on board a deckload'of
mules and horses for Fiji. Now Fiji can
get her mules and horses at a much
cheaper rate from New Zealand and Aus
tralia, and the story of the Victorious'
trip to Suva or JLevuka 13 taken with
grain of salt. In fact, Borne of the crew
of the big tramp say that their destination
Is Delagoa Bay and not' Fiji.
Still the Victorious may take on her
cargo of over 500 mules and go to FIJI.
That group of Islands Is about a fourteen
days' run from here and about a third of
the Journey to South Africa. At Suva or
Levuka the cattle could be landed and
given a rest, after which they could be
shipped again and tho Journey to South
Africa resumed.
The British Government Is buying large
numbers of mules and horses In tho
United States, and as the animals sent
from California to the Philippines have
proved a great success It looks feasible
that a shipment of the same animals
would prove very valuable to the British
In the war nojiv raging In South Africa.
The Victorious Is a modern tramp and
will prove to be a very comfortable horse
boat. She was built in IS9B at Newcastle
on-Tyne and is of 3434 tons gross burden.
She is 330 feet long. 46 feet broad and IS
feet deep. A berth has been provided for
her at Fremont-street wharf and as soon
as she docks there to-day the work of
getting htr ready for her long voyage
will begin. The mules have already been
purchased in Stanislaus County and will
be ready for shipment as soon as the
ship is ready to receive them.
The cruiser Philadelphia went to Mare
Island yesterday for an overhauling. As
soon as she is ready for sea again she
will sail for Samoa with Commander S.

Captain B. F. Tilley, who is now acting
Governor of the latest addition to the

building n coaling station there and the
chances are that .Governor Schroder will
take up his residence there. Apia, on the
Island of Upolu, at which the mail steam
ers stop, is now a German possession.
The transport Sherman will probably
pail thin week for Manila. She was schÂ«-<l
uled to depart next Thursday with a load
of army supplies and 400 casuals, but the
cargo cannot be got aboard In time, so It
will probably be Saturday before sho gets
away.
The transport Pathan had a narrow es
cape from' turning turtle the day before
she reached San Francisco. She was very
light, and when a squall struck her she
went over until the lee rail was under
water. Captain and crew thought she
was gone, but the tight old steamer right
ed herself and all hands escaped with a
scare. The Pathan Is owned by the same
people who own the Energia, which was
in trouble on the Japan coast. When the
Pathan reached Nagasaki the captain
heard of the Erergia's peril, and wltnout
stopping to coal went to her assistance.
When he found that the Energia was all
right the captain of the Pathan cam* on
to San Francisco Instead of going back
for coal. In consequence the steamer was
very light when the northwester caught
her oft Point Reyes.
Major J. M. Carson, quartermaster of
the transport Thomas, left for the East
last night, and his place has been filled
by Captain Charles G. Sawtelle Jr. Major
Carson goes to Washington, where he will

of the quartermaster's department.

There is In existence a Merchants' Cred

for the local merchants excellent work.
Its field Is distinct and does not trench
.particularly upon the field that the na

makes the claim that Us work has les
sened the number of failures In the coun
try and has limited the number of frauds
against creditors very largely. Something
like a score of States are represented In
the membership and In the executive com
mittee. The names of Pacific Coast men
have appeared in the list of officers sev

SEEKING A BANKRUPTCY LAW
ALSO AFTER THE COMMERCIAL

An attempt is about to be made to get
the merchants of this city and also of
Los Angeles and Sacramento to line
themselves up in favor of a uniform na
tional bankruptcy law; in favor of con
certed action of the business men of the
coast with the merchants of the East to
prevent the abuse of the credit system
of purchasing goods; also to try and have
the mercantile agencies furnish facts that
they do not give. This work will be taken
up by the National Association of Credit
Men and a representative of that body
is on the way to this city, which will be
the initial point for work in Californa.
Letters have been received by merchants
announcing that W. H. Preston, a promi
nent member of the National Credit Asso
ciation, will be here this week to enlist
co-operation with the national concern.
Mr. Preston has been doing some work
In Portland. Or. Much Interest Is manifest

will find all of his work of the easiest,

have been floating around lately and
â¢which say that the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe people are contemplating a raise

The rumor has It that this raise will be
come effective as aoon as the Valley road
is completed into San Francisco, which
will be some time shortly after the first
of next April. â¢
In order to institute such a change in
the existing rates the two railroad com

commission. Mr. Blackstock said he had
been spoken to on this matter by a num

that their side of the case was allowed
presentation before the commission before
the carriers were given permission to put

The officials In the State Fish and

over the success met with in the prose

of having salmon In his possession during

C. A. Vogelsang discovered a box of tho
forbidden fish in Giustl's place on Wash
ington street, which he seized. Half a
dozen fishmongers overpowered the offi
cer and took the box and contents out to
Harbor View, where It was dumped Into
the bay. They evidently figured that
without the evidence they would escape
the penalty of the law, which imposes
a minimum fine of $200. but the convic

WAS McCULLUM ROBBED?
John McCullum. an ex-packer in the
United States quartermaster's department
In Manila, who is a guest at the Brooklyn
Hotel, reported to the police yesterday
that between 11 o'clock Sunday night and
1 o'clock yesterday morning he had been
robbed in his room while asleep. He
claimed to have lost $20 In coin, a Moor
ish coin, dated 1255, valued at $100; a Span
ish dollar of 176S and a Bornese coin of
1304. besides two fob chains of Spanish
coins.
Detective Cody was detailed on the case
and he ascertained that McCullum had
Sunday night, while drunk, sold the Span
ish dollar to a man named Shea from
Boston, a guest at the hotel, for $2. which
raises a suspicion as to what became of
the other coins.

PROTEST OF A G. A. R.VETERAN
OBJECTS TO DEBASEMENT OF
STABS AND STRIPES.
Since the expose of his peculiar methods
in this city and Sacramento, A. W.
Moore, the commander and also the rank
and file of the phantom "Union Mission
Army" has changed the base of his oper
ations "temporarily %o San Jose. Imper
sonating and running an "army" at
Eighth and Mission streets was a profit
able business until the truth was made
public, after which Moore found it difli
cult to gather in his customary income in
San Francisco, and consequently, unless
some other towns come to the rescue, the
so-called shelter will be forced to close.
The spiritual portion of the work was
closed temporarily last week while the
"commander" was in Santa Clara County
telling the merchants there how much he
was doing for the poor of San Francisco.
Two of his assistants, who were also his
dupes, have left him. thoroughly con
vinced that the -shelter" was not the
proper place for decent people. These two
are Mrs. and Miss Hill, wife and daugh
ter ot a clergyman, who is on his way to
the coast from the East. Mrs Hill was
a canvasser for the "army" and Miss Hill,
a tÃipnted younK lady, was the organist
Â£t thl^misltoS^when Moore could induce
h^heÂ°uisgraceful conditions prevailing at
the alleged shelter were partly improved
after the expose in The Call, but even now
it is not a tit place for the habitation of
respectable women. '
Complaint has come up from San Jose
that Moore begged down there for several
days last week and because of his smooth
story collected a snug sum from the mer
chants for his "mission army. There la
no army with which Moore is connected,
and the people who gave to the com
mander" at San Jose were duped out of
their gifts as surely as the merchants of

trade of these Individuals consists of the
brazen-faced effrontery of this man Moore a
bass drum and a Urge American flag. This
man has been frequently proved to be a faker
aM a fraud? Wearing 'a uniform on the shoul
ders of which appear the epaulettes worn by a
United States officer, beating the basa drum
led by one of the women carrying the flag, this
man makes a niffhtly trip through the principal
m relts of the city, stopping at such places aÂ«
th-re appears a chance to collect a crowd, and
QihortinÃ those who listen to contribute to a

sentative! Of each dollar so contributed he
nuts out about 30 cents to keep on exhibition at
his resort a few chronic bums as examples of
those to whem be extends his so-called charity;
the residue goes into hU private bank account.

DECLARE THEY
NEVER SWINDLED
THEIR CLIENT
Smiths Deny Mariane
Louis' Charges.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 12.
The suit filed by aged Mariane Louis,
last Saturday, against attorneys J. H. &
Mortimer Smith, charging them with em
bezzling $1020 of her money, will come to a
speedy trial, The defendants to-day filed
their answer denying all salient allega
tions of crookedness and strongly intimat
ing that 'some one has imposed on the
aged French woman in persuading her to
commence the suit.
The attorneys Smith aver that they
agreed to take charge of plaintiff's litiga
tion over the estate of her son, the late
Edouard Louis of Alameda; that she
agreed to and did pay them a $160 re
tainer and that under a rvritten agree
ment, which is embodied in their answer,
they were to receive one-half of all they
recovered and pay costs of any appeal.
They Informed her that her claim In dis
pute amounted to $1455. Mary Louis, tho
widow and executrix, had previously dis
allowed the claim because it had been pre
sented after the time prescribed byÂ» law,
and several- suits ensued.
The aged mother finally advised her at
torneys Smith, so their answer avers, that
she would settle for nothing less than
$1500 in cold cash. After the attorneys
had negotiated and got $1800 she wanted
them to cut their fee to $500, claiming that
there had been no troublesome trial. To
this they vigorously demurred. The affair
was settled by the executrix paying her
mother-in-law $1800; she then paid the
Smiths $780, after deducting the retainer,
and she retained the balance of $10:50. Re
ceipts passed between the parties and the
aged litigant seemed perfectly satisfied.
Her suit, therefore, greatly shocked the
Smiths, who divine a conspiracy behind
the action.

Now Lamping Sues
on a $10,000 Note.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 12.
James J. Lamping ia determined to col
lect the $10,000 promissory note made in
his favor by his former employer, the late
Frederick Delger, who died In April, 1898.
Delger's estate has been appraised at
$131,231. '
Soon after the capitalist's death Ed
ward F. Delger, the executor, learning of
the existence of the note, brought suit in
equity to enjoin Lamping. from ever col
lecting the same. The court decided
against the executor. The note was dated
January 3 1597, and became payable
January 3 last. Lamping presented his
claim for the amount named in the note
to the executor, but tho latter promptly
disallowed it. ... ?,.,
To-day Lamping, by his attorney, Wil
liam R Davis, brought an action in the
Superior Court to obtain Judgment against
the Delger estate for the $10,000 and costs.
According to the complaint the note waa
made to Lamping by the late Frederick
Delger In pursuance of an agreement that
Lamping should as long as Delger desired
it refrain from entering into business or
employment with any other, party: that
he should continue as long as Delger per
sonally desired to manage his (Delger's)
business and property, valued at over
$1,000,000. Lamping alleges that he has
lived up to the agreement and that he has
protected the financial interests of Del
ger and has kept the accounts of his em
ployer, amounting to over $6000 per month.
Lamping also avers that, excepting the
payment of this $10,000 note, Delger dur
ing his lifetime had always performed
every act required of him under the con
tract, including the making of the prom
issory note. The suit will be bitterly
fought by the executor. .

BERKELEY UP IN ARMS
OVER WATER QUESTION
BERKELEY. Feb. 12.â The Town Trus
tees are up In arms over the water ques
tion. C. E. Grunsky waa recently em
ployed by the town to sink wells at San
Pablo with a view of locating an adequate
water supply for Berkeley. He bored four
wells and found that he could get about
600,000 gallons per day, which really ia the
estimated consumption' of Berkeley. Â¦ In
his report to-night Grunsky, together with
the joint committee, composed of Joseph
Le Conte. Dr. Addlson and Ed Neihaus.
recommended that the said supply would
be insufficient for Berkeley. The town will
therefore have to continue getttng its
water from the Contra Costa and Alameifa
companies.
When the report was read the Trustees
Jumped up In arms. It was recommended
that Grunsky be paid $500 for hla services,
that he and the committee be dismissed
and that a new committee be appointed.
Trustee Staats and others went so far as
to declare that Grunsky Is In collusion
with the Contra Costa Water Works.
FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT
TO BRIBE CHIEF BIGGY
An Ignorant Celestial Tried the
Wrong Man, and Is Now Suf
fering a Double Penalty.
Ah Sing's soulful voice Is heard in deep
wailing behind the bars of the California
street police station. Sing used his dulcet
tones last night in an effort to save hirn
eelf a night in prison for entering a house
of 111 fame. Finding that his pleadings
were a failure, he, in ignorance of his
man, tried to tempt his captor, Acting-
Chief Biggy, with a i"> note in exchanse
for his freedom. This open case of at
tempted bribery under his very eyes start
led the Chief, and for the moment he was
in a quandary. He, however, decided, for
purposes of evidence, to accept the prof
fered gold piece, but to the surprise of the
Celestial refused to allow him to escape.
Instead, the bribe-offerer was taken to the
California-street station and held pending
an investigation into his conduct.
Chief Biggy will in all probability to
day charge Sing with bribery. The China
man now laments the loss of his $5 and his
liberty. The gold piece will be held
against him as evidence, and his freedom
will be withheld until his friends offer
bonds enough to get him out of the pre
dicament.
Chief Biggy Is taking strenuous steps
to discover whether any of his men ac
cept money from the inhabitants In the
Celestial quarter. He has the greatest
confidence in the honesty of the officers
under him. but he wants to instill in the
minds of the Chinese that policemen will
not receive money for their protection.
There has bc-en a belief current in the
minds of the Mongolians that every offi
cer is open to bribery. By his prompt ac
tion last night Chief Biggy hopes to im
press on their minds that the belief was
unfounded. He will try to have an exam
ple made of Ah Sing as a lesson to others
of his race. " ; . :

DELIBERATED WHETHER HE
WERE ENGLISH OR CHINESE
OAKLAND. . Feb. 12.â Galbraith Masters, a bright student at the State Unl-.
verslty, found himself in a quandary to-day when. he appeared before Judge
Hall for naturalization. He was unable to state whether he was an Eng
lishman or a Chinaman. "I was born In China, of English parents," he ln- (
formed the court, "but now, really, I don't know whether I'm. a Chinaman or an'
Englishman, I do not know whether to renounce allegiance to the Emperor of
the Flowery Kingdom or the Queen of Great Britain. Perhaps you know. Judge."
Hla Honor, however, found little time to crack thla complicated nut of complex
nativity, but on the court's suggestion, and to remove any and all doubts, Masters
renounced allegiance to all foreign princes, kings, queens and potentates. The
question of his nativity, however, was not determined.

John P. Blunts Queer
Hallucination.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 12.
John P. Blunt, a traveling salesman for
the San Francisco shoe house of Rosen
thai, Feder & Co. and one of the bc^t
known drummers on the coast, was to-<Â«ay
committed to. the Ukiah Insane Asylum
by Superior Judge Ogden. He is vio.entiy
insane over money. 'Â¦ Â¦â .
Blunts mind became deranged about
two weefca ago while he was traveling
through Oregon. There he surprised ma
friends by announcing that his salary hai
been Increased to |12u0 per month, and ha
invited" about seventeen of his friends to
the theater and dinner, and rolled so h-f'i
that word was sent to his firm regarding
his strange actions. He next started out
employing anybody and everybody, prem
ising large salaries, making out checks
for enormous amount* and telegraphing
foolish orders until his stepson. WiHia:n
D. Wnoater, arrived to take char^o of
him and bring him to his home, at 2033
Cedar street. Berkeley, where he has sines
been treated by physicians. But his
mental condition grew worse, and it was
deemed advisable to have him cart<l t-r
at an asylum. He is a high degree XlaÂ«or..
John Jellinek has asked that a guardrail
be appointed.
Blunt imagines that his salary has kept
on increasing until he now receives $4.tX)0,Â«
("0 each minute, and he delights in th<; be
lief that he U Bpending it us fust as i. â¢
makes this imaginary sum. tie deolare.l
before the committing magistrate to-tlay
that he has purchased the Tlvoli and Oi
pheura and is negotiating for the Matdi>n

panies an the read, which he will taUc to
the world's fair. When asked by th-*
Judge whether his large wealth did net
sometimes worry him, he said.. "No, not
at all. 1 pay everybody off by check*
every Monday and manage all very we!!.'
One of his delusive schemes Is to buy the
Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railway*
and consolidate them. Thus he comir.Uf*
to talk excitedly about his vrtat Intfrest*.

out notifying leaders of bands and owners
of opera-houaea that 'he has purchase!

of quiet and gentle demeanor, Blunt now
swears like a trooper. â¢Â¦- "â¢
Although hlÂ» accounts with the San
Francisco firm are unsettled, it Is believed
that these will be found quite correct.
Blunt is to years old and has a wife and
two stepsons in Berkeley. His mental de
rangement is partially attributed to over
work and worry. %
SUPERVISORS
STRUGGLE WITH
CITY FINANCES
Vexed Question Still
Unsettled.
STREET LAMPS MAY BE UNLIT
HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S USE
FULNESS CURTAILED.
Laborers' Wages Fixed at Â§2 50 a
Pay â Resolutions Allowing Ex
tra Clerks Are Laid Over
for One Week.
The Board of Supervisors had a hand
to-hand struggle with the perplexing
question of the municipal deficit, but the
subject was found to be bo complicated
that its consideration was postponed for
another week. During the discussion sev
eral ways were suggested to make up a
prospective deficiency, which, according
to Supervisor Reed, will amount t0.5211,
000, at a low estimate. Supervisor Tobln
stated that leaving the city's streets in
darkness for the rest of the fiscal year
would help the situation $100,000, and his
suggestion on that point was received
with some favor. It was also suggested
that by stopping street sweeping alto
gether another $70,000 would be made
available, but this suggestion was evi
dently not as acceptable as the first.
Mayor Pnelan called attention to the pro
tested taxes, amounting to $151,000, which
could be used, provided a decision favora
ble to the city is rendered by the Su
preme Court. To this could be added the
$10,000 appropriated for Trocadero Canyon.
"If St. Mary's park fund of $125,000 can
be used," said his Honor, "the city's
financial stringency will be relieved to a
great extent."
Resolutions allowing the Health Depart
ment $35,000 for the ensuing six months
were adopted, but only after considera
ble argument, in which Reed vigorously
opposed the granting of any such sum
while the city was threatened with bank
ruptcy. Reed favored allowing the de
partment a bare $3000 per month, which
Dr. Williamson, who addressed the board,
thought would be sufficient to prepare the
city to resist aTT invasion of the bubonic
plague. Reed argued that there was not
a single cent to the credit of the Health
Board and it was criminal to rush into
debt and make other creditors of the city
suffer. Dr. Williamson thought that the
department could get along on $35,000, but
that its efficiency would be materially im
paired. He said that the reduction would
nave to be met In other ways than by a
reduction of force, as contemplated by
the resolutions.
"We reserve our right," said the presi
dent of the Health Board, "to taaintaln
the offices we have created. We may sus
pend some employes temporarily or main
tain groups of men on half time, but
there are some things we cannot dis
pense with, notably the free distribution
of anti-toxin to the poor, whereby the
mortality from diphtheria has been re
duced from CO to 11 per cent, and the
milk inspection, which has reduced infant
mortality B0 per cent. The Bureau oi
Vaccination is likewise an absolute ne
cessity."
To a question of Reed's as to what steps
he would take to prevent the entrance of
the plague Dr. Williamson said:
"I would crder the burning of China
town."
Dr. Williamson, while expressing him
self as in a measure satisfied with $35,000,
asked the board to increase it If possible,
but promised that there would be no over
draft of the lesser amount, which he was
finally allowed, Reed alone voting against
it. . .
The resolution fixing the rate of wages
to be paid to the laborers In the Street
Department at $2 60 per day for eight
hours worried the board for some time.
It developed that the charter is not quite
clear whether the power to fix the rate
lies with the Supervisors or the Board of
Public Works. Some members took the
lafter stand, but the motion to refer the
matter to that body was lost. Another
motion to refer to the City Attorney for
advice was likewise lost. The argument
took such an unpleasant turn that some
of the Supervisors were compelled to ex
plain that they were not opposed to the
$2 50 rate, but wanted the legal doubt as
to the authority settled. The vote on the
adoption of the resolution was unani
mous.
The Board of Public "Works was re
quested to examine into the present con
ditions, requirements and safety of the
entrances and exits of all theaters, halls
and public places of amusement.
An ordinance was passed to print pro
viding for a free license to persons who,
by reason of misfoFtune or physical in
firmities, merit exemption from the pay
ment of license.
A resolution was adopted providing that
the matter of an ordinance empowering
tho assistant clerks of ' the Board of Su
pervisors to administer oaths be referred
to the City Attorney for his opinion
thereon. The same course was taken with
the proposed ordinance for the issuance
and sale of bonds for the construction of
sewers, hospitals, school houses and park
panhandle.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company was requested to place electric
lights at the intersections of Joost ave
nue and Arcadia stret, Flod and Circu
lar avenues, Sunnyside avenue and Congo
street, Sunnyside avenue and Edna
street, Hearst avenue and Detriot street
Foerster street and Mangels avenue.
The resolution authorizing the Auditor
to appoint four clerks at $100 per month
each, the Recorder a mortgage clerk at
$100 per month .and the Treasurer one
clerk at $150 a month and one at $100 were
laid over for one week.
Resolutions were laid over for one
week providing that the Board of Public
Works be requested to omit the sweep
ing of the city streets one night of each
week; also to notify the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company to omit the
lighting of gas and electric lamps for
three nights before full moon, the night
of full moon, and for two nights after
full moon, for the remainder of this fiscal
year.
The City Attorney was requested to ex.
amine into and report if the $125,000 set
aside by the last board for the acquisl
ton of St. Marys Park properties is or is
not a special fund, and whether It can bo
used for any other purpoae than that for
which it was created.
The resolution authorizing the archi
tects of the Hall of Justice building to
make certain changes in the original
plans at a cost not exceeding ?13,910, pro
vided said changes do not interfere with
the completion of the building by the Pa

EBELL OFFERS
PRIZES FOR THE
LIBRARY PLANS
Ladies Want a Beau
tiful Building.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
IHB Broadway, Feb. 12.
The ladies of the Ebell Society want the
new library building to be worthy of
Oakland. Having taken so great an Inter
est in the securing of a sits they now
come forward with a plan for furnishing
competitive plans for the building, and
they offer to pay out of their own fund
$1750 for prizes fqr the plans. The library
board has been discussing offering $300 for
a prize for the plans, but the Ebell ladies

"Aladdin Jr.," with new songs and feat
ures, is on again this week at the Grand
Opera-house. Edith Mason made the first
hit in the play and was forced to respond
to an encore and u grain sing her new bal
lad, "Since Thou Art Mine. ' Miss Mason
also sang "The Sweetest Story Ever
Told," which Is doubtless her most popu
lar effort. Little Maude Sorensen won the
hearts, of the audience with her "coon"
song, "Don't You Cry,. Ma Honey." Her
buck and wing dancing was perfect. Hat
tie Belle Ladd and a male quartet In "My
Lady Lv" is one of the catchy features
of the entertainment.
Chutes.
Major Mite sang the latest telephonic
negro craze, "Ring Off, Coon," at the
Chutes Theater last night, and had to re
spond to even more encores than usual.
Paul La Croix, a hat juggler, made his
first appearance, and made a hit, as did
also George Bird, programmed as "The
Chinese Ambassador." The latter does
a clever musical act. Valkyra, equilib
rist, Ruth Nulta and her plckanniny,
Blanche Le Claire Sloan on the flying
rings and Doug-lass and Ford, singers
and dancers, complete an interesting bill.
Symphony Concert Thursday.
The musical event of the week will be
the third of the symphony concerts, under
the direction of Henry Holmes, at the
Grand Opera-house on Thursday after
noon, at 3:15 sharp. The programme will
be the most interesting yet presented, and
includes Beethoven's "Corlolan" overture.
Brahms' variations on a theme by Joseph
Haydn, Wagner's great "Tannhauser"
overture and symphony entitled "Frater

"The Viceroy," by Victor Herbert and
Harry B. Smith, Is the longest comic
cpera of modern times. It had Its first
production at the Columbia and there was
expectancy In the gallery and orchestra
and a display of ftnery befitting the occa
sion. The frills and feathers of the au
dience, however, did not hold a taper to
thÂ«: gorgeous garbing of the staÂ«e people.
It wts the costumers' night to shine and
he did so in every color of the spectrum.
"The Viceroy" might almost be called a
costume cpera. There Is more to It than
the costumes and scenery, which are both
remarkably good in this production, but
the sense of sight plays an Important pt.rt
la Judging its merits.
The beginning is not happy, either mu
sically or bookishly, ana ruily three-quar
ters of an hour elapsed before there was
a genuine laugh or a sincere plaudit.
When it comes to cutting it down to rea
sonable lengthâ it now lasts nigh unto
midnight â the first scenes may be very
freely pruned without a sacrifice being
committed.
The composer, in his characteristic!
style, has aimed at popular effects, and,
having caught what he thinks will catch
others, he proceeds to rub It In diligently.
Thus wo find the "Tlvolinl" song, which.
by the way, every one was whistling after
the tirst curtain, repeated again and
again. It is as unnew as the latest joke,
but it will lind its way into the phono
graphs shortly, and "The Viceroy" will
be made la spite of anything the critics
may Eay.
1 have had occasion lately to point out
the fact that Harry B. Smith can perpe
trate the most utter trash and call It a
comic opera libretto that mortal man has
ever betm asked to listen to, but he dis
guises his identity in this, his ultimate
effort, and "The Viceroy" is poor in
Smithlsms and in comfortable circum-
Mance.s as far as humor is concerned.
The general grotesqueness of the multi
farious comedy part has much to do with
the laugh-getting, but Mr. Barnabee. who,
of course, has a. proprietary interest in
the opera, has a number of obese lines,
Â¦which he works to the best advantage. 1
may say here that I refer to Mr. Uarna
Â»Â¦<-e's share in the dialogue, and not to his
tnatorcy.
The company has another alcove tenor
in Frederick Knights; and Miss Marcla
Van Dresser, whose voice did not sound so
bad when she was hoarse, 1 find has in
her normal state a very poor voice in
cU-ed. and ehe dues not know how to use
what she has.
Helen Bertram has her personality
with her, and the dash that makes her
go winsome; vocally she is not remark
able in pifts or method, but she is more
than adequate to the company she is in.
Her song in the second act was novel
and <uÂ» she sang- it) very pleasing.
Victor Herbert has not risen out of the
De Koven class, nor does he promise to
do so; his music is typical of the man,
and within its own laws it is good airy
fluff â the stuff that comic operas are
made of: "The Viceroy" has been tried
on us, and to-day we will be telling one
ft-noihrr that U Is really not half bad.
The Bostonians came here with a "Here,
Frisco, Frisco, lie down and be a good
dog; we have an opera to try on you," and
behold Frisco likes It much better than
cthÂ«-r attempts that have been made on
Us digestive organs, ami if I mistake not
the firm of Harnabee & Macdonald has
not perhaps another "Robin Hood," but
certainly another "Serenade." I hate the
"Serenade." POUTER GARXETT.
Orpheum.
There are so many "best bllle" and "best
weeks" at the Orpheum in the ordinary
couree of a year that the expressions be
come worn out. yet they lit the perform
ance this week. The Cushman, Holcon.be
ai:d Curtis trio made a great hit with their
eccentricities and singing. Usually in
f"me vaudeville entertainments that have
confronted the people of this city the fe
male fingers have outcrowed the crows,
and have eet teeth on edge with raspy
throated shrieks; but this was the oppo
site. The woman is a sweet singer and
tlÂ»e men chime in well with her. Thea
there is Frank Coffin in his last week
with hi? best efforts, and Irene Franklin,
with her agreeable songs and pleasant
Fmiles. to top off the musical week. The
Uartons are ameng the best of the kind
ia the coontown sketch, the Ronialo
brothers have d:scovtrÂ»-d a novelty in ac
robatics. Dt-ets and Don bring pome of
the European vaudeville flavor with them
from over the water and Monroe and
Mack are the latest good things in the ne
gro line. Papinta's wonderfully brilliant
lire dance should not be missed. It is a
revelation of grace and color possibilities.
Alcazar.
The farcical comedy, "Oh, Susannah,"
tickled the risible faculties of the large
audience at the Alcazar Theater last
night for about two hours and a half. It
has something of the touch of "Charley's
Aunt" In It. but the dialogue is not so
smart nor the situations so cleverly
worked out. The real central figure in
the piece is the "slavey," and Georgie
Woodthorpe made the most of it. She
astonished every one by her really clever
portrayal of the part and ; was honored
with a ppeeial call before the curtain.
Ernest Hastings, as a young doctor who
married without his aunt's knowledge,
upon which incident the plot, if there be
one. is based, and Mary Hampton, as his
young bride, were clever and kept up the
fun. May Blayney, Laura Crews, How
ard Scott and Stanley Hose, as young
lovers, had little to do. but they did it
well. Margaret Marshall Was the aunt
and Maggie Frances Leavey, the doctor's
landlady. Jeffrey Williams and Forrest
Seabury completed the cast.
California.
Those who attended the performance at
the California Theater last evening were
well repaid, for "An Unconventional
Honeymoon," as presented by the Fraw
ley company, holds the attention from the
rise to the fall of the curtain. T. Daniel
Frawley as Eric Aubrey and Keith Wake
man as Leo, his wife, were the center of
attraction and every bit of the perform
ance, whether laughable or serious, car
ried the audience without effort.
All of the minor characters fitted well
Into their places and came in for their
chare of applause, which was not spar
ingly bestowed.
The management announces that "Trll
by" will not be presented at to-raorrow'a
matinee as previously advertised.
Alhambra.
There was no decrease In the attend
ance at the Alhambra Theater last even-
Ing. The Jeffiies-Sharkey battle has
created a 6tlr among the sport-loving
people of this city, and the latter are tak
ing advantage of the opportunity of see
ing the memorable battle fought over
again by means of the marvelous mov
ing pictures taken by the American Muto
scope and Uiograph Company. As ex
emplar* of photography the pictures are
marvelou*. and as a portrayal of the
memorable battle between the two heavy
weights they are unsurpasÃe<l. The spec
tators eltp enthralled an the fight pro
cresses and often breaks the *tillness by
voicing: approval of a blow well delivered.
The pictures are a success, and will bo
viewed by thousands before they are
taken to another place.

Nine of the Six-Day Pedes
trians Have Dropped Out
of the Contest.
ST. LOUI3. Feb. 12.â Frank Hart, the
powerful negro pedestrian, lost the lead
this afternoon In the six-day go-as-you
please race in progress at the Natatortum.
but at 11 o'clock to-night was only one lap
behind Hegelman, who had succeeded htm
in the leadership earlier in the day.
Hart gained five miles on Hegelman
early In the race when the latter was
forced to retire for an hour on account of
sickness. . Since he has been back on the
track, however. Hegelmao has dogged
the footsteps of Hart and made the col
ored ' man's life miserable. The terrible
grind has caused nine of the eighteen
men who started in the race on Saturday
night to succumb.
The score at 11 o'clock to-night stood:
Miles. Laps. Miles. Laps.

ZOROASTER
MADE GEYSER
DO HIS BEST
Close Fits Between the Two
Opening Day at Tanforam
Choices Beaten.
An all-seeing eye watches o'er the des
tinies of. Geyser, or else Ed Corrlgan's
pet would have been beaten at Tanforan
yesterday. By the ridiculous conditions
of the race for which he ruled a 1 to 3
favorite, Zoroaster and Potente, the for
mer only a four-year-old, were required
to pick up more weight than the Corrl
gan entry. In -a hard drive, aided greatly
by the presence In the saddle of Spencer,
Geyser earned the verdict from Zoroaster
by a neck in 1:39%.
In the other events favorites took two
races. The weather was clear and balmy,
and the track fast.
Starting a 9 to 5 choice, Montgomery
made his farewell turf appearance in the
six-furlong spin, third on .the card. After
traveling a quarter, the great sprinter
broke down and was pulled up. Coming
from way back, Jennie Reid, a 12 to 1
shot, ridden by Walsh, finished like a cy
clone, beating QUt Ben Ledi, the pace
maker, a head on the post. Genua fin
ished third.
Sixteen maidens . started In the opening
flve-and-a-half-furlong scramble, with
Isaline closing a slight favorite over Cor
rigati's' Artilla. The winner turned up in
the Cadeau, a 10 to I chance, played down
to 8, which won all the way. Isaline was
led out for the place by Beautiful Bill.
Frank Doss started the fast sprinter
Faustoro in the six furlong sprint follow
ing, and his price was quickly hammered
down from 8 to 5 to 6 to 5. Taking the
lead into the stretch, he won handily from
old Captive; against which 20 to 1 was
laid. Morgan landed Inverary 11, a 100 to
1 shot, in the show.
Barney Schreiber's useful filly Sofala
suffered another defeat in the two-year
old dash. The crowd backed her off the
boards at a short price, and Corrigan's
M. F. Tarpey had the footing over her
all the way. Six lengths behind the first
choice, Intrata ran third.
An awful poor quartet of platers lined
up in the final six furlong run. After a
long, hard drive Waterwick, the favorite,
led Harry Thatcher out a neck, with
Gusto a fair third.
Track Notes.
Only fourteen books cut in. a consider
able falling off from Oakland.
While being galloped on the track Ho
henzollern ruptured a blood vessel, fall
ing dead on the track, Saturday morning.
A bullet ended the career of Montgom
ery. While runnlns in the bunch during
the progress of the third event the once
great sprinter broke down and Vittitoe
quickly pulled him up. An examination
showed the case to be hopeless and a
leaden messenger put him out of pain.
Owner Billy Magrane was unable to sup
press tears at the loss of his old bread
winner. - â¢
Ben Ledi. but recently purchased by
Garnet Ferguson, was claimed out of the
third race by_ G. W. Scott, owner of Lady
Britannic. The fllly was entered to be
sold for $400, costing the new owner but
$725.
After Faustoro, entered to be sold for
$300, had captured the second event. Dan
Hanlon bid the horse up to $800 on Frank
Doss, getting him at that price.

NATIONAL
CLUB AFTER
W. A. BRADY
A Telegram of Inquiry Sent
Him â Gossip of the
Fighters.
.Messrs. Brady and Considine. respective
managers for Champion Jeffries and ex-
Champion Ccrbett, are still dickering on
a time and place of holding a battle be
tween the heavyweight sluggers. Last
accounts have it that the contest is to
take place before the Seaside Athletic
Club at Coney Island, and that the Na
tional Athletic Club of this city has been
allowed to go "by the board." The treat
ment received by the local club has en
gendered a great deal of unkind feeling
toward the managers of the alleged cham
pionship battle, and should it ever be held
It is doubtful whether any Californian
will be seen at the ringside unless he is
a relative of one of the principals or vi
tally interested in the outcome of the
match.
The excuse offered by the promoters of
the right that the JioOO was nut forwarded
to the East is ridiculous. The money was
deposited in the business office of a morn
ing contemporary, which was represented
in New York by a daily paper. Both
Brady and Considine were apprised of the
deposit by the Associated Press and
Gibbs. and yet, without the courtesy of
"by your leave," both managers turned
over the coming contest to the Seaside
Club and turned the local club managers
down.
Manager Glbbs has consulted friends,
and they advise him that he has some
rights in the premises and tell him to
keep possession of the telegrams sent him
by Manager Brady. They particularly re
fer to the following dispatch, which was
received by Gibbs last Saturday night.
when everything looked promising for
the fight to take place in this city:
NEW YORK. Fab. 9.
J. D. Gibbs, National Club. San Francisco,
Cal.: If $2000 goes up to-day fight settled for
San Francisco. Try and make It between April
20 and 25. I think If you can draw aa good
a crowd outdoors there will be good money In
pictures. Agreed on Sam Au.Â«tln as referee.
He to receive $100 from club and both principals
and $200 from winner. Answer fully, naming
date April 25 If possible. W. A. BRADY.
Manager Glbbs has not yet heard from
the East, and last night, on the advice of
his attorneys, he aent the following dis
patch:
William A. Brady, New York: National Club
deposit ud since Friday, subject to order of
Stakeholder Smith. Let uÂ« know by wire what
your Intentions are. J. D. GIBBSv
Tim McGrath. who was a second of
Sharkey in his recent battle with Cham
pion Jeffries, returned to this city on the
overland yesterday morning, bringing
with him Frank McConnell. whom Mc-
Grath trained for his contest with "Mys
terious Billy" Smith. Tim Is full of East
ern ring gossip and has many things' to
say of Interest to the local sporting pub
lic.
"McConnell found that the climate of
the East did not agree with him. said
McGrath, "and he steadily lost weight. In
this State he takes on weight, and when
he. enters the ring at 150 pounds to ngni
Al Neill I am confident he will win. If ha
does, we will try to get a return match
with Smith here. Frank's friends lost a
good deal of money on his recent contest
and we want to give them a chance to get
even.
"The bisr arc lights over the ring when
Jeffries and Sharkey fought made the
heat so Intense that. It affected the acaips
of the fighters and seconds. Jeffries' hair
and mine have been dropping out ever
since then. When Tom broke his rib o.Â»
Jeffries' right in the fourteenth round he
was sailing through the air trying to
reach the big boiler-maker's Jaw. It was
a terrific contest.
"I think Corbett has a good chance to
get the decision over Jeff, because he ha.-i
been In training for some time and looks
in his old-time form again. He sparred
with McConr.ell several times. They say
Corbett Is a "has been/ but they said the
same of Choynskl. "Has beens' sometimes
surprise everybody. O'Rourke and Consi
dlne treated us well in New York and w*
had a good time, but all are glad to get
back to San Francisco."
Charles Long, manager of the \v estern
Athletic Club and well-known fight pro
moter. Is now in Seattle. It Is said on
good authority that Long intends leaving
shortly lor Cape Nome as manager for
Peter Jackson, Frank Slavin and Fred
Russell, heavyweights well known to ring
follower*. %"*. _ , .
"Jack" Kane and "Jimmy" Lawlor. who
are to fight before the Columbia Athletic
Club on March 1. are to meet at 13^3
pounds. It Is stipulated In their articles
of agreement that Â£Â£0 must be pa:d for
every half pound either man is over
weight. As a result, both men are train
ing hard to save the money.
It Is rumored that the National Club s
lease on Woodward's Pavilion is about
due. and that in future that club will hold
Its contests In the new quarters of the
Columbia Club, at Eighth and Market
"Fatty" Blodes essayed to drive a num
ber of sporting men to the training quar
ters of O'Brien and Jackson yesterday.
The result of his attempt at handling the
lines was two breakdowns, broken har
ness and an upaet In a ditch. Blodes Is
still posing as a reinsman of ability.
The next fights to be held by the Co
lumbia Club will be held some time next
week Willie Cole is to box De Coursey
twenty rounds; "Kid" Johnson is to meet
Jack Dennis of the Olympic Club and
"Bill" Peary and "Bill" Condon will box
ten rounds for decisions.
The following communication was sent
to the sporting editor of The Call by
"Jack" O'Brien:
BLANKEN'S SIX-MILE HOUSE, Feb. 12.
Sporting Editor Call: I hayÂ« Just learned
that Frank McConnell Is In town and Is
matched to flKht Al Nelll next month. Why
Mr Nelll should meet Mr. McConnell In pref
erence to me is something I can't quite under
stand. When we were matched a second tlmo
and slcne.l articles of agreement I agreed to
a postponement because Mr. Neill complained
Of an lniury. I did not understand that tha
match was off. I took on Peter Jackson In
the interim and I hope Mr. Netll will remem
ber that I should be given the first opportunity.
Thanking you for your paÂ»t wirtesles lara,

Kilpatrick Will Sue the Auditor.
E. C. Kllpatrick, principal of the Busi
ness Evening School, who was ousted
from his position by a former Board of
Education, has expressed his intention to
sue Auditor Wells for twelve months'
back salary, amounting to $1200, to which
a decision of the Superior Court holds
that he Is entitled. As the -demands were
not filed until last April and other claims
take precedence, the Auditor was unable
to paes them until* moneys received as
collateral Inheritance taxes were avail
able. Wells thereupon informed Kilpat
rick that he would sign six of the twelve
demands on the 61 per cent basis upon
which demands of IS9B were passed. Kll
patrick refused the offer ,and besides
threatening to make a certain exposure,
the nature of which he would not divulge,
announced his Intention to bring suit.

PEOPLE WHO FIGURE IN THE MANAUENSE INVESTIGATION
For sleeping in his room when his immediate
and close attention was demanded in the en
gine-room.
â¢In leaving Manila without having the bilges
cleaned . and . the . dirt removed from the flre
room.
In not ascertaining before leaving Yokohama
that there was sufficient coal on board to carry
the ship to San Francisco.
In causing the vessel to be put Into Yoko
hama for repairs.-
Secondâ lncompetency, . for not ascertaining
that a fusible plug had blown out of the boil
ers, causing them to leak.
In not closing the Bea-cock before taking the
valve out of the injector, thereby allowing a
large quantity of water to enter the engine
room.
Third â For being intoxicated while on duty
at Yokohama.
Fourthâ For lack of discipline generally, and
particularly In allowing: the -soldiers on board
the vessel free access to the engine-room, to
the detriment of the dynamo ar.d other ma
chinery.
On these charges the engineer was
tried, the two witnesses examined yester
day being Captain Barneson, master of
the Manauense, who brings the charges
and John B. Barneson, chief officer of the
Manauense, his son. The owners of the
vessel and the defendant were both rep
resented by counsel, and the trial proceed
ed regularly as bfore a court.
Captain Barneson spent the morning
session and a good part of the afternoon
telling his story of the eventful voyage of
the Manauense. They left here with 400
men of the Thirty-tirst Regiment last Oc
tober. Everything went well until after
they left Honolulu. An attempt was. made
by the defense to show that? some of the
Hreroom force deserted at Honolulu, but
it was shown that of the five who got
away two were returned, so the force was
but three short. The second day out from
Honolulu the Manauense made her best
day's run, and then a few days after that
trouble began. The chief officer discov
ered there was over three feet of water
under the plates of the flreroom. The chief
engineer was in bed at the time, but when
the: chief officer called him he got up at
once and went below. He said one of. his
assistants. Second Assistant Engineer
Dunleavy, had opened a seavalve and it
could not be closed, and the water wai
pouring through. The, pumps were out
of order, and the water had to be bailed
out with the assistance of men from the
deck. Then the bilges commenced to fill
again, and this time the engineer said the
water came from the condenser, which
had to be emptied into the bilges and
then a third excuse was made that a fus
ible plug had blown out and the water
was coming through the leaks in the
boiler. In the meantime it was discovered
that some of the boiler tubes had been
leaking so badly that two of the fires had
been out for four days, although no report
of such a state of affairs had ben made
to the captain. After some time the plug
was found and fixed, the valve was closed
and the condenser was set right, and the
vessel made Manila, =
Before leaving Manila she was thor
oughly repaired under the supervision of
the chief engineer. Captain Barneson
said that he had lost faith in the engineer
by- the time they reached Manila, arfd he
tried to get another man in his place, but
he could not. Dunleavy, the man accused
of opening the valve that could . not be
closed again, was discharged 'at the isl
ands. When the vessel was ready to sail

known, he announced that he had been
married, and with his bride started on
the honeymoon that has been delayed
for eighteen years.
The couple went directely to New
York. There Mr. Dunsmuir was
stricken with sickness and forced to
take to his bed in the Imperial Hotel,
where he died on the 31st of last Jan
uary. The body was embalmed and is
now in this city, where it arrived last
night, in the charge of his widow and
brother.
When seen last night James Dusmulr
said that he did not care to discuss
the romance of his dead brother's
marriage, but the reason for keeping
it secret was because it was known
that it would not meet with the ap
j proval of his mother. He refused to
either admit or deny that his father's
will contained any provision providing
for partial disinheritance in the case
of such action on the part of his
â¢ brother. Mr. Dunsmuir said that the
deceased was 46 years of age at the
time of his death, and that the body
' will he burled in Mountain View Cem
etery, Oakland, as soon as prepara
tions for tho funeral can be made.
"When questioned concerning the value
of the estate left by his brother Alex
ander, James Dunsmuir said that it was
far over the million mark, but just
how far he was not inclined to divulge
at the present time. He further stated
that this fortune will not go to the
widow. If such is the case the other
relatives of the dead man will prob
ably divide It among them.
Besides his brother James the de
ceased leaves three sistersâ Lady Mus
grove, wife of Sir Richard Musgrove,
who formerly occupied a high Govern
ment position at Victoria; Mrs. Lieu
tenant Colonel Houghton, deputy ad
jutant general in control of one of the
Canadian districts, and another, who
Is still unmarried.
The Dunsmuir property consists of
the ownership of the greater part of
Vancouver Island, of the only railroad
thereon, of the Nalnamo and Wellington
coal mines and of sailing and steam
vessels without number, as well as of
immense holdings of city real estate in
Victoria and most of the other Puget

Investigation by the
British Consul.
STORY OF ILL-FATED VOYAGE
CAPTAIN BARNESON BLAMES
THE CHIEF ENGINEER.
Evidence to' Show That the Whole
Trouble Lay in the Incom- Â¦ Â¦
petency of the Engine-
Boom Force.
The British authorities have the start
of the United States in the investigation
of the transport Manauense. The sensa
tional reports of Lieutenant Colonel Webb
Hayes, who was in command of the de
tachment of the Thirty-first Infantry that
went over to Manila on the vessel have
caused comment by the United States
Government, but they have secured action
on the part of the Government of Great
Britain. Charges were preferred by Cap
tain James Barneson, the master of the
vessel, against the chief engineer, alleg
ing a variety of offenses, and, with the
charges for a basis, W. Clayton Pickers
gill, British Consul for this city, appoint
ed a board of three-~two old sea captains
and himselfâ as a naval court of Inquiry,
and before this tribunal the merits or de
merits of the vessel will be tried. , ;V
The two sea captains selected are James
Wilding, forty years a master of vessels,
twenty-five of which were spent on steam
vessels, and Edward Perks, as long a
follower of the sea and a man well known
on this coast as an able commander. The
charges preferred by Captain James Bar
neson are as follows: -â¢'.-. : :
San Francisco, Feb. 6, 1900.
W. Clayton Flckersgill, Esq.. British Consul,
Port of San Francisco, San Francisco. Cal.
Sir: Owing to the fact that Mr. McDonald,
chief enelneer of the S. S. Manauense, under
my command, did on the last voyage of the
vessel, while under charter to the United
States' Go\ - ernment as a transport, allow the
machinery to get in such a condition that seri
ous damage resulted, causing loss of time and
severe criticism of the vessel by the United
States Government officials and the officer com
manding troops on board the vessel; and also
from the criticism and report being forwarded
to Washington and being taken up . by the
press of the country, subjecting the owners to
further loss by the fact that the United States
Government has withheld and is withholding
all charter moneys due the vessel until an in
vestigation can be made, showing where the
blame lies for the said trouble, I most respect
fully ask for a court of Inquiry and desire to
prefer against the said William McDonald,
chief engineer of the S. S. Manauense. charges
of willful neglect, lncompetency, drunkenness
and lack of discipline in the following in
stances:
Firstâ Willful neglect, for allowing ashes and
dirt to accumulate In the flreroom and get into

street M. E. Church last night and deliv

composed largely of seamen > from the
ships now In port. Captain Lloyd was in

in which he had conducted a religious

LEAPED INTO THE BAY.
Despondent Mrs. Sullivan Tried to
End Her Existence.
Deserted by her husband and left alone
to battle with the world with three small
children depending upon her for bread.
Mrs. Kate Sullivan became so despondent
that last evening she tried to drown her
sorrows in the waters of the bay. She
was rescued by Officer Hlghtower and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
drunkenness. â¢ ' â â¢ â¢
Mrs. Sullivan, who lives at 3 Ellis street,
was deserted by her husband about three
years ago. She is 2S years of age.-and her
oldest child is now eight years old. Since
her husband left â¢ her she has auported
herself and children by doing housework.
When the unfortunate woman leaped
into the bay a passer-by raised an alarm,
which wan heard by Hlghtower. Mrs. Sul
livan's mental ' sorrows seem In some

VISIONS OF A SIERRA SUPPLY
BCHTJBSLEE DEFENDS SPILING
VALLEY.
He Paints a Glowing Picture of the
Corporation's Past, Present and
\ Future, and Under Fire
*; Becomes Sarcastic
The Board of Supervisors met last night
ae a committee of the whole to discuss
water rates preparatory to the establish
ment of prices for a year. Supervisor
Connor presided and Mayor Phelan acted
as chief inquisitor of the witnesses pro
duced by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany. No definite result was reached, al
though the cession was far from, being
uninteresting.
Tbe Mayor In hiÂ« questions sought a
treat deal of minute and detailed Infor
mation In reference to the statement sub
mitted by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, particularly relating to the Items
of expenditure Included under permanent
construction and Improvement. The an
swers were given in most part by Her
man Schussler, but occasionally by Pel
ham W. Ames. Mayor Phelan Insisted
upon knowing why It is that the water
company demands interest upon property
which la not In use and may never be
In use by the company.
Mr. Schussler replied that in some In
stances the company did not expect ever
to use certain land* and was willing that
the cost price should be deducted, but it
happened that this cost price Is very
email and will not materially affect the
problem of water rates. In other cases
the water company has purchased prop
erty not now in use for the simple rea
son that the property could be bought
cheaply and warranted an expenditure
now rather than later, when a great deal
of money would be required. The prop
erty thus purchased will In time be put to
use. In expectation of a .greater demand
the company therefore uas taken pre
liminary precautions.
The problem of water supply also
formed an Interesting phase of the in
quiry, the witnesses declaring that not
withstanding nearly three dry seasons the
company has now a two years' supply on
hand The consumption of water is in
creasing:, but the natural supplies of the
peninsula have not yet been exhausted. In
lfijb the daily consumption of water in San
Francisco was 23.250,000 gallons. In 1899 the
consumption was 23.000.WX) gallons a day.
The financial phases of the company's
affairs also engaged attention, the Mayor
attempting to prove that the annual In
vestigations made by tho Supervisors do
not have a demoralizing effect upon the
ftock of the corporation. Mr. Schussler
was Inclined to believe that the manner of
the Investigations had a bad effect, but
the general results did not. The stock is
now Belling lower than It has before In
many years, but Secretary Ames lean* to
the opinion that this Is due to politics. He
â¢was not ready to admit the suggestion of
the Mayor that Democratic politics was at
In discussing the cost of material Mr.
Echussler made the startling assertion
that owing to the advance In the price of
Iron the pipe system of the company la
now worth a million dollars more than It
was before the rise. The company, though,
has a policy of estimating values only on
a basis of cost to the company. One by
one the items in the company's statement
Â¦were reviewed, but most of them added
nothing of Interest to the investigation.
The Mayor displayed considerable interest
in the advertising account and was given
a promise that an itemized statement will
be supplied. His Honor is invariably cu
rious over anything relating to a news
paper.
He was Inquisitive, too, about the char
acter of the counsel fees paid.
"What services does William F. Herrin
render to the company?" he asked
"Legal services." Attorney Kellogg
hastened to interject. "He is frequently
called for consultation."
"Only for consultation?" the Mayor
asked.
"Yes, sir," was the reply, and that old
time underground passage to the board
was carefully covered from prying eyes.
A discussion of the feasibility of ob
taining water from other sources than
those utilized by the Spring Valley Water
Company called out a sharp . passage of
arms between Mayor Phelan and Her
mann Schussler. The Mayor asked if
about $16,500,000 would not be enough to
establish a system in the Sierras.
Mr. Schussler thought that a great deal
more money would be needed, as the esti
mates made did not take into considera
tion valuable rights of way and an enor
mous increase in the price of materials.
"We are told." said the Mayor, "that
60.000.00 1 > gallons of water are going to
waste from Clear Lake. Do you think
that we could obtain that?"
"Are you ready to employ me to find
out?" asked Mr. .Schussler blandly.
"Are you wlllln- to accept such an em
ployment?" asked the Mayor.
"I don't think you could pay me
enough," was Schussler's answer. "But
would you consider me an expert?"
"I certainly would not," was the sharp
reply. "But you consider Mr. Manson or
Mr. Grunsky experts, do you not?"
"Yes," was the hesitating answer; "they
are good surveyors Â¦ and engineers, but
they have not had the requisite experience
in building water works.
The Mayor, still clinging to the Sierra
proposition, asked why It would not be
better to establish a system In the Sierras
rather than try to patch the Spring Val
ley Water Company system.
"We are not patching." was the reply.
"We are growing with the growth of tlie
city."
In discussing the iwsslble supply of the
Spring Valley Water Company, taking in
to consideration only the properties now
absolutely under control and In the pos
session of the company, Mr. Schueeler
declared that with the expenditure of
$15,000,000 a daily supply of 100,000.000 gal
lons can be easily given.
An adjournment was then taken until
to-morrow night, when Spring Valley val
ues will be discussed more in detail.

from Manila the chief engineer reported
all in his department as fit for sea. Some
of the firemen who had been discharged
told the first officer he would have as
much trouble going home as they had
had coming out, unless he cleaned out the
bilges under the boilers, but as the en
gineer the next evening reported the
bilges all clean he thought nothing of the
matter until three days out on the way
to Nagasaki, when he made an Investiga
tion of his own. He found about a ton
and a half of dirt under the boilers, and
he ordered the engineer to clean it out.
This the engineer did cot do.
Then the ship began to leak again, and
before long the water was again up to the
flreroom plates and in danger of putting
out the fires. The engineer said tne
pumps would not clear her. as they were
useless and could not be fixed. He coum
not tell where the water was running and
gave again the three explanations he had
given before on the trip out. It was fin

was found that there was not enough coal
on board to take her to San Francisco so
they had to put into Honolulu to fill the

It was a case of love at first sight,
and the more Alexader Dunsmuir saw
of his dulcinea the stronger grew the
bonds of his affections. He knew the
social aspirations of his father, and he
knew that these aspirations were
shared by his mother and the other
members of the family, and that a
marriage contrary to their wishes and
approval would mean his disinherit
ance. But love was stronger than cu
pidity, and, after a brief courtship,
he secretly married the object of his
affections and installed her In a beau
tiful house that he. built on the
Souther Stock Farm, near San Lean
dro. which place he purchased for
his bride.
There she lived for many years as a
widow, devoting herself to the educa

by her first husband, who subsequently
entered upon a stage career, married
and was divorced from De Wolf Hopr

At the time of the purchase of the
Souther farm considerable comment

erected on it as a residence. The hefuse
