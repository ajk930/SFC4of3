SECOND DAY
OF THE BATTLE
LONDON, Feb. 9.â The Daily Telegraph
has received the following dispatch, dated
Tuesday, February 6, from Spearmans
Camp:
"This is the second 'day of. the battle,
and fighting has been fiercer than it was
yesterday. At dawn the Boers began the
action by shelling our. bivouac with, their
long Tom and pompon guns from Doom
Kloof.V Their six-inch shells fell. near the
spot where General Buller and his .staff
were watching the engagement. One shell
burst amid a squadron of the Thirteenth
Hussars, but not a soul was touched.
"Our guns from Zwarts Kop and on the
plain soon silenced the enemy's artillery,
but repeatedly the Boers Â¦â¢ brought back
their guns, popped them Into work' across
the hills, fired a few rounds and then
again changed their position.

BULLER'S TASK
MOST DIFFICULT
LONDON, Feb. 9.â The Times, in an edi
torial dealing with General Buller's task,
says:
"The problem before him Is unquestion
ably most difficult. We cannot- be sur
prlsedor disheartened should he be unable
to solve it with success. His task is not
merely to force a- way. through the Boer
lines to Ladysmlth. That operation would

War Office. The sending for
ward of troops continues.
WHAT THE WAR
COSTS BRITAIN
LONDON, Feb. 9, 4 a. m.â All the mes
sages from the observers with General
Buller throw in a phrase or two about
"the strength of the Boer positions" and
the "difficulties of General Buller's work."
but they .do not carry events beyond
Tuesday "evening. ..-viu^jâ râ - >â¢ -
Their last slender narratives, leave the
British advance on Vaal Krantz, in the
center of a semicircle, where the troops
arc- exposed to the Boer artillery on both
sides and in the center. The fighting con
tinued until 9 Tuesday evening, and al
most without doubt continued Wednes
day, as the Boers certainly would not
leave this wedge Into their lines unmo
lested. It is also inferred that General
Buller must either continue his advance
or rttire.
The heaviest fighting appears to have
been on Tuesday. General Buller's 233
casualties are mentioned as having oc
curred before noon Tuesday. Large lists
sre consequently expected for the rest of
the day. The casualties already reported
bring the total British losses during the
war to 10,244 killed, wounded and cap
tured.
The disposition here is rather to mini
mize the importance of the fighting in
Natal and to suggest that this is only an
incident anyway, placing hope upon ex
pected decisive engagements in Northern
Cape Colony and upon the invasion of the
Free State by Lord Roberts. At all events
this is the official view.
The public does not like these new
waits, and there is sharp anxiety for fur
ther news.
In Cape Colony General Mac Donald has
had a skirmish with a thousand Boers at
KoodcoEberg. This was on Monday. The
Boers have been taking the offensive
agnir.pt General French near Rensburg
as well as against General Gatacre In the
Stormbc-rg hills.
Since the war has strained the resources
of the military system Englishmen have
heen troubled by the possibility that sea
fighting might show naval defects, whicn
would weaken the first line of defense in
which the country has placed such com
plete trust. This apprehension has sud
denly found expression. During the last
two or three days in half of the news
papers of England the Government's at
tention has been specially directed to the
muzzle-loading guns. Even public nun
have been pained to learn that sixteen
battleships and eight armored cruisers de
pend upon muzzle-loaders. .This means
that smaller but faster ships with modern
guns would be able to stay 1000 or 2000
yards out of range and to disable in leis
urely fashion about one-third of the ves
sels which now appear In the naval list
as "first-class."
The Admiralty Is understood to be pre
paring to remedy this defect and to pro
pose also considerable additions that will
preserve the present ratio of Great Brit
ain's naval strength to that of France
and Germany.
The supplementary army statement to
March 31 was laid before the House of
Commons yesterday, but was not made
public.
It is reported that the call is for Â£20
000,000, which would make the cost of tJe
war up to that date Â£30,000,000. The main
tenance , of 200,000 men at the front, it Is
estimated, costs between Â£8,000,000 and
Â£10,000,000 per month. '

camp this morning from a high ridge 6&W
yards away. Finding the range on the
third shot, their 1412-pounder Creusot guns
pitched nine shells within a radius of
thirty yards around the Cape mounted
rifles' guns, which were unable to reply
owing to the range being beyond their
capacity.

MUST CRUSH THE
REPUBLICAN FORCE
LONDON. Feb. 9.â Spencer Wilson,
discussing General Buller's latest move
ment, in the Morning Post to-day, says:
The adopting: of this line of action la that tt
offers the shortest road to Ladysmlth. The
disadvantage is that with modern weapons the
operation of plercinsr the enemy's front is one
of the utmost di%culty. Arter beginning each
olde can concentrate on one point of the ene
my's line the fire of the long portion of its
own front of all the riflemen alcr.g a front
of a mile and a half and of all the tfuns along
a front of three or four miles. As the assailant
chooses his point of attack he can at the out
set sain a superiority of fire against that point,
but as he advances and pushes back part of
the enemy's line, the enemy can pour on his
troops the converging fire of a great semi-cir
cle, while the assailant's fire from his convex
front Is divergent rather than convergent.
If. however, the assailant can find cover for
his leading party he has a converging nre
against the two ends of the defending semi
circle, and he may. therefore, hope to drive
hU opponent back. ', to widen the gap he has
made and then, as he pushed fresh troops into
it and hold* the enemy along the rest of hu
front, to roll up either wing of the defense.
- This task, hard in any case, is rendered
harder when a river must bÂ« crossed, for Â»
river between two armies prevents the assail*
ant from engaging the defender alons his
whole front except with artillery, ar.il there
fore the defender, as soon as he recognizes tha
real point of attack caji hurry troops from both
wings to his center. A river also limits the
number of troops thatan assailant can bring
to bear, for they must all cross a bridge or
bridges by defile.
General Duller has made a good start. In
order to be able to advance he will probably
have to drive the Boers from Doom Kloof, to
separate the tv.-o- Boer wings, and then, while
holding one of them, to attack and crush tne
other.
That cannot be an easy matter, for they can
move troops fasten than we. ami will probably
pour a converging fire from the north and west.
if not from the northwest and east, on Vaal
Krantz.
We hear from Ladysmlth that Boer heavy
baggage has gone toward the passage. The
Boers are well aware that defeat means for
them -he raising of the siege of Ladysmith
and th -lr retreat from the district. It Is to
be h.toed that General Buller will press the
attack, and will not tire even If the engagement
lasts several days. The case resembles that of
General Grant's battle at Fort Donelson. when
he first realized that It was a question which
of the two armies, both tired of fighting, could
first renew the attack, but General Buller can
not relieve Ladysmith except by defeating and
driving away the Boer army and thus raising
the siege. He cannot cut his way through the
Boers and march on to Ladysmlth, leaving the
Boers undestroyed on his flank. That would
only lead to the toes of his army.
Short of breaking the Boer resistance ha
might, however, by a sufficiently vigorous and
prolonged attack compel them to call up re
enforcements from the Investing lines and thus
make l\ possible for Sir George White to break
through these lines and march to Skits Drift.
That movement would be costly. It would be
gin with the sacrifice of the heavy guns and
with heavy loss in the sortie. There would
then be Â» great pressure on the rear guard.

with safety. .We await the issue of the
operation with great anxiety."
Elsewhere the Times takes heart from
the fact that General -Buller is "playing
his part : in the general scheme and is
being- co-ordinated by; Lord' Roberts." | It
says on this point :<~
"The British public Is still kept in igno

expected. -It is difficult to believe that the
Boers are equally ignorant of. the dispo

LONDON, Feb. 9.â A dispatch to the

"Little can be seen of General Bullcr's

the Boers have withdrawn their big thus
from the hills southward of here. A larse
force of Boers still remain and the garri
son is prepared for a night attack."

of questions on the subject of the Delagoa

ary Secretary for the Foreign Office, said

LONDON, Feb. 9. â This
morning's news, so far as it
goes, leaves General Buller
holding the positions north of
the Tugela, which he won on
Monday and defended against
Boer attacks on Tuesday.
On Wednesday the British
commander seems to have been
holding fast to what he had se
cured and making no attempt to
advance. His heavy guns and
transportation was evidently be
ing brought up. This unavoid
able delay again gives the Boers
an opportunity to mass a strong
force in front of him.
The valley through which it is
believed General Buller plans to
push his way to reach Lady smith
is dominated on one side by Vaal
Krantz and on the other by
Doom Kloof. The British hold
the former hill or ridge, but the
Boers have many men and guns
on the latter, and can sweep the
valley and prevent the passage of
the British infantry. It is cer
tain that the artillery will play a
very important part in an at
tempt to force a way through the
pass, so that General Buller may
not have resumed the offensive
until yesterday morning, if in
deed he did then.
It is learned that a private ca
ble to a well-known Boer from
Spearmans Farm says that on
Wednesday Buller was holding
the position gained, and that
Ladysmith's relief is certain.
While of course the sender of
the optimistic message must be
taken into account, it seems cer
tain that the outlook for the
British arms is rosier than at any
time since the war began.
A large crowd was at the Wat
Office throughout the day. Bul
ler's first list of casualties, num
bering about 230, was received
in stony silence. The people
have made up their minds that
heavy losses are inevitable and
are prepared.

Krantz . is seized upon by
some of the London papers
as a justification for the em
ployment of Indian native
troops in South Africa. There
is no doubt that a couple of bat
talions of those wonderful hill
fighters, the Goorkhas, would be
very useful.
Clubland developed yesterday
quite a new and powerful inter
est in the progress of the war,
whetted by the news, which was
taken to mean that a general
move of the British forces had
commenced., Thus there was a
larger attendance in the clubs
this morning than has been seen
for weeks. Crowds stood around
the telegraph boards.
It is a striking fact how cau
tious the average club man has
become as to accepting news
from the front. A few weeks ago
everything was taken for grnnt
ed. Xow members go to the
telegraph boards and thence to
the war map, and make up their
minds only after much inspec
tion.
To-day the fear of Boer tactics
is universal. For instance, this
morning I heard much doubt ex
pressed as to General Macdon
ald's safety at Koodoosberg
Drift, it being argued that as he
had got there so easily, the pos
sibility was, as on previous oc
casions, that the Boers had in
tentionally allowed him to reach
there with the object of hemming
him in the more easily.
The opinion heard is that the
less news we hear at present the
better it is. The immediate re
turn to the news detail is reck
oned by a capable authority to
have the effect of making officers
on service nervous. The idea is
presented thus: The generals
don't like fighting under the mi
croscope. There is no doubt
that public sentiment is very
hopeful. This is reflected in the
city, .where on the Stock Ex
change, that great and generally
true barometer, Americans and
mines were strong.

greeted with cheers and every demonstra
tion of pleasure. In a low tone, plainly
showing suppressed emotion, Mr. Bard
said:
"It is too difficult for me to express my
feelings when facing this wonderful dem
onstration of approval and confidence in
recognition of an honor that seems to
have met the approval of the State. I
consider It a great provilege to greet the.
people of Los and at such a time
as this I do not believe that I should go
beypnd thanking you for this evidence of
your kindness and esteem."
Senator and Mrs. Bard were presented
to hundreds of citizens as they hied

Senator Bard said to-night that he would
arrive . in San Francisco Saturday morn

Ventura and he will leave for Washing

Bard was asked if he had seen the charge
in the San Francisco Examiner that V\a
Sugar Trust had spent money in San
Francisco. to bring about his election.
"I have seen the story to which you re
fer," was the reply, "and I need not honor
such a baseiesa statement with a denial. I

Defending Their Coop.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"BELVEDERE, Feb. B.â To have six
chickens devoured by a cannibal dog Is
bad enough, but to get knocked out with
a broom while defending your property
from the onslaughts of the enemy is
worse. This was what befell Mrs. Coop
of this place and her ally in the attack
was the deliverer of the blow which put
her out of commission.
For some nights past chickens have
been missing from the coop and Mrs.
Coop, who is the wife of John Coop, pres
ident of the Belvedere Land and Water
Company, has laid awake nights recently
to capture the depredator. Miss Coop also
has an Interest In the chicken combine
and 6he. too, watched and waited. Last
nig"ht the vigilance of the sentries wa&
rewarded by the sight of a large St. Ber
nard besieging the hen laager. The relief
column sallied out and laid for the en
emy In the shade of a kopje. When the
dog appeared with a chicken gracefully
falling in festoons from his nether lip
Mrs. Coop screamad, but Miss Coop, being
armed with woman's weaponâ a broom
aimed at the canine chicken - thief a
vicious "swipe." In the excitement of the
moment she must have mistaken her
mamma for the St." Bernard. A feeble
scream, followed by a heavy thud, ap
prised her of the execution she had done.
Mrs. Coop lay motionless for a few mo
ments, but a copious application of cold
water soon brought the flush of life again
to her cheeks. As she was led Into the
house she was heard to remark on the
vividness and beauty of the stars, but as
it was a cloudy night this was put down
as being an optical delusion. The Coops
now buy their eggs at the grocery store
and the henhouse will be converted into
a monument for the dogâ when they
catch him. â¢
HEPBURN OPPOSES
CANAL TREATY
Says It Concedes Too
Much to England.
WASHINGTON. Feb. B.â Representative
Hepburn, chairman of the House Inter
state and Foreign Commerce Committee,
which has charge of the Nicaragua Canal
appropriation, opposes the canal treaty
with Great Britain now pending in the
Senate.
Â¦"I think," he said, "that the negotia
tions of this treaty are very unfortunate
and that it ought not to be ratified by the
Senate. I donlt know that the pendency
of the treaty will interfere with action by
Congress on ihe Nicaragua Canal bill, but
the ratification of the treaty would cer
tainly impair the value of the canal. when
constructed.
"This treaty reaffirms the principles of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, conceding all
the claims and contentions of Great Bri
tain, though Great Britain has, by her
own action, given us the right at any
time to abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty. It surrenders everything to Great
Britain, abandoning our contention :of
years that we might abrogate the treaty
at will.
"Moreover. It recognizes the right of
any foreign power to interfere and dic
tate with reference to our negotiations
with the present Governments of thla
continent. It abandons the Monroe doc
trine."
LONDON, Feb. B.â ln the House of
Commons to-day, replying to a question
as to whether Great Britain has relin
quished all her rights under the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty In respect,to the Nicaragua
Canal, and if so. what, compensating ad

change, the Parliamentary. Secretary of <
the Foreign Office, WUHans St. John Brbd

compensation, . the ; advantages of the for

a companion bill to that refused passage
in the Senate yesterday, was responsible
for a small storm. As had been the case
in the Senate, a number of amendments
were offered to make it a little more pal
atable to the legislators. Amendment af
ter amendment was offered by both the
friends and foes of the bill, and when It
was returned to the printer Governor
Gage himself would not have recognized
it. The measure as amended is too harm
less to live, and It Is the general expres
sion of the members that even In Us pres
ent form It cannot pass the House. The
Senate expressed itself on the measure
yesterday.
Brown of Colma spoke strongly against
allowing the Governor the powers he
asks. He pointed out that in Federal
matters the President never Interferes in
department affairs, and to grant such
power to Governor Gage would be an in
novation. Furthermore, he said, the pow
ers asked are quite unnecessary.
After recess the Assembly considered
Assembly bill 2, granting the Governor
power to suspend the sale of any part of
the public lands of the State. The bill
met with bitter opposition, as did that
giving him extraordinary powers. In re

amended against the protests of the Gov

GOVEBNOB GAGE has locked herns with the Legislature. His
customary boprishness, displayed in its latest . example in an
insult to United States Senator Bard, has provoked indigna
tion and a natural spirit of retaliation in both houses. The members
therefore are defeating the proposed legislation of the Governor with
more satisfaction than the intrinsic unworth of the measures would
suggest. The Governor will not receive the autocratic patroncge
power he expected, and in revenge he has framed a scheme to starve
the legislators into submission. Both houses can adjourn this week
with all work don-, but the Cfovernor is "lotting to keep the members
in session for an indefinite time without pay. The issue will be
fought out, it is expected, to-day. * "
CALL HEADQI'ARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. X.â Little will come out of
the extra session to gladden the heart of
Governor Gage. His hopes of autocratic
power have been crushed, he is discred
ited by his party and the session thnt he
expected to create him the political "It"
of .the State has disappointed him. al
though he has craftily planned to starve,
the legislators into submission. He will
pass Into history as a party outcast.
None of the pet measures he pleaded for
5n his proclamation will be passed by
eUher branch of the Legislature. Many
of his shortcomings misrhthave been over
looked, and as a compliment to him*j=ome I
cf his suggestions Â¦would have been fol- I
lowed, with certain modifications, had it
not been fcr the gratuitous insult he of- j
fered Senator Hard on the occasion of the :
reception tendered the distinguished Yen- |
turan.
Even Gage's friends condemned his ac- i
tions as i-mall and beneath a man with ;
the least semblance of dignity . and de- |
ceacy In his make-up. Whatever chance Â¦
of passage any of the Governor's meas. |
ures had previously vanished with his re- \
ception pouting. Yesterday the Senate j
registered the lirst decisive rebuke when I
St turned down the bill giving him the j
power of removing attaches of the State I
insane Asylums. To-day the Assembly j
followed the example of" the upper houÂ«s*e j
and snubbed Gage by a most decisive !
vote, although the members of the House i
are yet Ignorant of the full fieaning of i
Gage's latest scheme to delay them in |
Sacramento without pay.
The hospital bill was the first measure '
njerainst which his hopes were crushed, i
"Wade offered an amendment limiting to 1
four years the tenure of office of hospital
employes. Btlshaw presented an amend
ment to the amendment by which the ap
proval of the Governor in cases of re
moval would not be necessary as at pres
ent. Belshaw's amendment was adopted I
by a vote of 36 to 31.
The Governor's land bill was the next
to go down. The argument against its
past-age was that Gage was trying to
delegate to himself powers that belonged
to the Surveyor General. The same vote
that spoiled the assault on the hospital
IÂ»atronape defeated the land measure.
Both Senators and Assemblymen de- j
clare boldly that they will oppose any
legislation advocated by Gage solely on
account of his treatment of Bard. They
claim that as the Venturan was practi
cally the unanimous choice of the mem
bers of both houses the Governor's sulk
ing was as much of an insult to them as
to the new Senator: for that reason they
do not consider Gage has a right to ask
any favors of them even If the atmos
phere of suspicion that surrounds all his
bills was not sufficient in itself to kill
them.
HOW LEGISLATORS MAY
BE STARVED INTO LINE
Fjwlal Dispatch to The Ca
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. B.â Assemblyman Dibble,
acting presumably In the Interests of
Governor Gage, is engineering a clever
scheme to force the passage of the
patronage bills. The Governor has mar
.â¢-haled the remnants of his forces and is
making a last desperate effort to capture
the State patronage. It Is proposed to lit
erally starve the legislators into submis
sion by prolonging the session after next
Monday, when their pay stops.
Dibble made his first move In the game
this afternoon, when he delayed considera
tion of the concurrent Senate resolution
until to-morrow. T.he move was cleverly
masked and the Assemblymen did not
know they were falling Into a trap until
after it was toe late, and the Governor"*
coterie began to buttonhole for votes to
carry through the measures which would
enable Gage to become a patronage pirate.
A conference committee is to be the
agency by which, the issue is to be forood.
There are two patronage bills on to-mor
row's Assembly file. In addition Dibble
has persuaded his Judiciary Committee to
report back a third bill, more seductive In
Its wording and more sweeping in Its
ecope. In the Senate an innocent amend
ment to section 772 of the Penal Code has
been pawed through the Judiciary Com
mittee. It adds but a word or two on the
line- of removal of officers by the courts, a
procedure already recognized by law. If
any of those bills art* passed and amended
by the concurring branch of the Legisla
ture a conference committee will bn de
manded by the House and the session
will be prolonged indefinitely.
As pay stops Monday and many of thÂ«*
lawmakers are not only homesick, but !n
financial distress. It is the hope of Dibble
and the Governor that they will consent
to vote for the patronage bills against

I I annual session of" the State Young
r"\ Men's Christian Association con
1 I vened in the association .building
J- *â¢ this evening. The room was decor
ated with American flags and evergreens
for the occasion. In the, absence of D. E.
Collins. State chairman, C. G. Baldwin
of Claremont, chairman of the Southern
California branch, called the association
to order at 5:30 o'clock and offered prayer.
A temporary organization was effected by
selecting C. N. Hand of Pomona College
temporary secretary. The nominating
committee was named by selecting one
member from each association present.
A sumptuous supper was served in the
main auditorium by the ladies of the
Methodist, Methodist South and Christian
churches. At the close Secretary Speares
of the Redlands association called upon
Mayor William Fowler, who spoke on be
half of the city. He said:
I consider it an honor to welcome the asso
ciation to this city and trust that it would,
be to your good as well as ours. rever
the Bible has gone the Young Men s Christian
Association has followed. A letter from far
off Burmah received this week from my daugh
ter, carries the intelligence that It has a good
foothold there. The' association here has been
a good thing for the city, bringing people who
ere leeded In every good city.
On behalf of the churches of the city
Rev. Dr. J. H. Williams, pastor of # the
Congregational church, said in part:
We, the people of the churches, look upon
the Young Men's Christian Association as not
something outside the church, nor In any sense
a rival of the church, but as a valuable part
of its activities, affording a common ground
for all denominations, upon whose platform all
can' stand, proving a real church unity. We
welcome you to a city of churches, a place
where church work, church life and church
attendance is made very prominent. As in
early New England, so here now. the whole
family goes to church. Here In Redlands all
denominations work together In close fellow
ship. Our city Is a progressive city not only
materially, but rellclously as well. New and
attractive church buildings are one of the
characteristics of this city. You are welcome.
You will find a congenial and healthful atmos
phere.
H. K. Pratt, vice president of the Red
lands association, extended a welcome in
behalf of the Redlands association. He
said in substance:
If there le any one thins I am glad of to
night It Is that we, as an association, all have
one father and one elder brother. Without the
fatherhood of God there Is no brotherhood of
man. We shoold be proud of being- co-workers
In this great organization represented here to-
to the people of his State will quickly result
In a full restoration to them of their powers
of government under the law. May God be
with you In all you say and do.

MANIFESTO TO FRIENDS
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. B.â Justus
Goebel to-night issued the following- open
letter:
.My Friends: In closing these last sad rites
and before the remains of the kindest, gentlest
and most loving of sons and brothers be con
signed to their final resting place, I want to
say a last word. ,','-:
Your friend â my " brotherâ lies dead before
you, murdered for his devotion to the cause of
the people.
Should not Kentucky, now and here, swear
by his blood thÂ«t her sons will see justice done
to those concerned In his foul taking off? If
you fall In this then your laws are dead let
ters.
If he could speak he would say now, as oft
before, "let the law take Its course." Will de
signing men of high- station be permitted to use
the Ignorant outlaw to further their ambi
tions, and when that ambition is disappointed
turn red-handed murder loose under the very
roof of the executive mansion?
Shall the guilty In high places be. uncovered?
Shall the honor of your State be restored? Or
shall h'.s life blood, split on your Capitol
square, be dried up by the sun. washed away
by the rains and his life sacrifice be forgotten?
Measured by the highest standard of man. the
grandest tribute possible to be paid him to
whom you have been bo loyal is to fjght for the
principles for which he laid down his life as
he fought for them.

DEMOCRATS TO SOON
ORGANIZE GOVERNMENT
FRANKFORT. Feb. B.â Unless some ac
tion regarding the Louisville agreement is
taken by. Governor Taylor to-morrow or
next day, or some word sent to them re
garding his Intentions, the. Democrats will
proceed upon the hypothesis that he does
not intend to take any action and will go
ahead with the organization of their State
government at Louisville. A" conference
was held this evening in the Capitol Ho
tel, at which Governor Beckham, Sena
tor Blackburn, S. J. Shackelford and John
K. Hendrick were present.
The delay of Governor Taylor In declar
ing himself regarding the Louisville
agreement- was discussed at length and it
was agreed by. all present that in their
opinion the Democrats had waited long
enough. It was agreed at Louisville that
the Legislature should meet in the Capitol
building on Mondayâ and It is now so near
that time that the Democrats are begin
ning to think that Governor Taylor may
take no action regarding it within the
time limit set. One day more will be al
lowed for some Intimation from Governor
Taylor, and If it is not forthcoming an
other State government will be organized
at Louisville. ,
Not a Democratic member of the House
was in. Frankfort to-day to attend the
funeral, and to-night Governor Beckham
General Castleman and a few other Dem
ocratic leaders returned to Louisville to
take matters in hand there. The report
was given out that orders had been Issued
to arrest such members of the Legislature
as might come into town to-day, but this
was denied by Governor Taylor, by Adju
tant General Collier and Colonel Williams,
all of them saying that orders to that ef
fect had never been Issued at any time
during the trouble.
on behalf of the visitors. He said that he
had heard much of Redlands and Its cli
matic influence, and thought the change
would do him good. He said that tne
Young Men'i Christian Association build
ing here would do credit to a city ten
times the size of Redlands. He said that
tho coming of the convention meant more
to the. young men of the city than any
other meeting ever held here. The salva
tion of the young men of the State should
be the keynote to this convention.
C. K. Ober of Chicago, international sec
retary, spoke briefly of the work through
out the world. .
D. E. Collins of Oakland, the State sec
retary, presided at* the evening meeting
of the convention. An address was de

night where all laws of the true and the cood
may meet on one' common platform and where
what wâ¬ profess is of less importance than
what we do. We realize that no Christian or
ganization In existence has so many search

association. We believe that our organization
has fairly stood the test and to-day Is like
our Sunday-school, one of the most practical
avenues that lead to the better life.. The Mayor
has, figuratively speaking, given you the keys

On behalf of the business men of Red
lands John P. Fisk said:
I am clad to represent the business men of
Redlands In welcoming you to this city, for I
am proud of them. There Is a stronp spirit of
union and they all stand together for Redlands.
They are loyal and proud of this city In which
they live. I too am proud of this city and

In behalf of the press A. H. Corman
said that he took pleasure to speak in be

the papers of the city, and extended a
hearty welcome.
Mr. McCoy of San Francisco responded
It is thought the work to be accomplished by the present convention will be a" stimulus for the raising of the
debt on the Redlands Young Men's Christian Association building. The debt has within the past few weeks been re
duced from $16,500 to $7000 by subscriptions of citizens.
HOTEL AT SAN QUENTIN
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Valuable Adjoining Property Saved
by Prison Guards and Crew
of the McArthur.
Special D:sratch to The Call.
SAN Qt'ENTIN. Feb. S.â Flames broke
out at 9 o'clock to-night in the Point
House here on the wharf. The place was
run as a hotel by John George, a Greek,
and was an old landmark. In spite of the
efforts of the prison officials, supple
mented by the work of sailers on the
United States survey ship McArthur, the
building was burned to the ground in less
than an hour.
The flames were first seen by Frederick
Emmand, a sailor on the McArthur,
which is anchored just off the point.
Giving the alarm to his shipmates, a
boat was manned and lowered. Under the
supervision of Boatswain Cattelsen the
jacks rendered gallant service in saving
the stock of liauor and several pieces of
furniture. The proprietor, John George,
claims that an enemy of his, who Is a
liquor dealer in San Francisco, was the
man who started the fire. George gave
the following account of the first discov
ery he made- cf the flames which devoured
his hotel: k
"I was sitting In tho barroom when
I heard footsteps in the adjoining
sitting-room. I ran to tho door
and saw (lames leaping to the celling from
behind the 3tove. I have lost my all and
my enemy Is the cause."
The hotel was situated on tho wharf
belonging to the North Pacific Coast Rail
road, and It is solely owinjr to the neroio
efforts of the prison guards, headed by
Captain of the Guard Russell and the
jacklcs of the McArthur that tho corpora
tion's property, including the station
house and storage-shed, was saved.
There was no insurance on the house and.
the loss is about $3000. The hotel was
owned by the Buckalew estate.

SAX JOSE, Feb. B.â A suit that at
tracted much sympathy and interest was
heard before a jury in Judge Rhodes' de
partment of the Superior Court and Is
one in which a father is suing his ollnd
son for $200 advanced for medical treat
ment on his eyes. The plaintiff In the
suit is Rev. A. M. Bailey, a well-known
divine. of the Methodist church, who has
preached the gospel in this State since
1552. The son's name is George H. Bai
ley.
Some years ago the son lost his eye
sight and entered the home for the blind
at Berkeley. The Rev. Mr. Bailey is a
man of large means and owned a fine
ranch near Santa Clan and other prop
erty. In 1594 he Induced his son to leave
the home at Berkeley an.; jir.-.mised to
pay him $50 per manth for his support.
Later the elder Bailey gave the son a life
interest in twelve acres of land in lieu of
$12 50 per month, and afterwarJ deeded
him a life Interest In two cottages In Saa
Jose in lieu of 123 additional per month.
Tta-Â» son In the meantime had bean, fur
nished a cottage for himself and family
in College Park.
The $200 on which suit Is brought was
borrowed in April. 1809. At that time tho
son claims his father requested him trÂ»
take it to have his eyes treated. Both
father and son were on the stand this
afternoon and told their sides of tho
story, and the great bitterness of tho for
mer toward his son was shown. Tho
story as related above wu told. The son
claimed his father had oald him but
$37 50 per month of the promised $50. and
as an offset of the $300 borrowed he claim
ed there was due him $12 50 per month,
since 1&34. Rev. Mr. Bailey emphatically
denied this, claiming that the use of the
cottage In College Park by defendant and
family with property turned over to him
completed the $50 per month agreement
entered Into.
After an hour's deliberation tho Jury
returned a verdict in favor of the- blind
son.
CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
CONVENTION OPENS
HONOR GOEBEL BY
MARCHING IN RAIN
Monster Parade and Touching
Services at me Funeral of the
Assassinated Governor. .
FRAXKFORT. Feb. B.â Rain came down
in 6heets to-day while the funeral services
were being held over the body of Ken
tucky's dead Democratic leader. The
morning dawned dark and threatening,
but at 9 o'clock the clouds cleared away
and run carr.e out bright and brilliant and
there wae every promise of a pleasant
<Say. The prospect was short-lived, how
ever, for Just as the hour for the forma
tion of the funeral procession arrived, the
rain began to fall. Flowly at first, but with
ever-increasing rapidity and shortly after
the hour of noon, wtien the parade was on
the march, the flood began to descend
with Increased viciousness and continued
all through the afternoon. The exercises
in the cemetery were conducted before a
crowd much smaller than, would have
been the case if the weather was pleas
ant, but they were carried out to the let
ter and to-night the body of William
Goebtl lies in the chapel of the Frankfort
Cemetery, after one of the greatest fun
eral demonstrations ever seen in this
State. Ac soon as the weather clears suf
ficiently the casket will be consigned to
the grave.
It had been feared that there might
arise trouble between the soldiers in the
Capitol grounds and the Democratic par
tisans in the line of march when the par
ade passed the Capitol square, but nothing
of the kind occurred. The soldiers were
kept back on the level with the front of
the Capitol building and a line of sentries
was posted in front of them to prevent
them from goJr.g rear the fence on the
couth side of the grounds at the time the
parade was passing the sctuare. Orders
had been issued on the Democratic side
as well that no comments should be made
by the men In the parade as they passed
the grounds where Governor Gofbel re
ceived his death wound. The wisdom of
the commanders of the troops and that of
the Democratic leaders, adaed 10 the fact
that for twenty-four hours all saloons had
been clor-ed. enabled the day to pass with
out any exhibition of feeling being shown
on either Fide.
Early in the morning the arrival of
people"to witness the funeral exercises be
fc-an. most of them in the early part of the
day corning in buggies from the surround
ing country. By tne time the early trains
had arrived, the crowd was enormous.
Special trains came in from Georgetown
and Lexington and a few other places not
far from Frankfort, but the large crowds
came on the regular trains from Louis
ville and Cincinnati. Fully 10,(KÂ»0 people
were on the streets to watch the funeral.
The body lay in state in the parlor of the
Capitol Hotel until 11 o'clock in the morn-
ing and more people viewed the remains
this morning than yesteruay afternoon
ana last night.
At times the jam in the doorways leading
to tht parlors was too great for anybody
!o force a passage through. The police
force of Frankfort Is not largeâ only six
menâ and it had its hands full. When it
was massed at a given point the force was
good enough, but when separated it was
helpless. The crowd was remarkably well
behaved, however, end there was not an
unpleasant episode connected with the
proceedings from first to last.
The procession began to form at 11
o'clock on Wapping street, headed by the
city police force and members of the City
Council, city officials,. Grand Marshal Da
vid H. Murray and his aids. Then came a
long column cf members of different so
cieties and citizens on foot. Governor
Goebel was not a member of any secret
organization, but his father is a promi
nent member of the Odd Fellows, and the
local members of that body turned out
strongly to do him honor. None of the
societies were uniformed.
The column moved promptly at the ap
pointed time, which was the hour of
noon, and marching north on Wapping
stret-t turned west on Broadway, which
would take them past the Capitol grounds.
The rain was falling heavily as the pa
rade passed the grounds and the men
were marching rapidly.. The front of the
Capitol building was covered with soldiers,
who stood watching the parade, but save
three sentries at the gate there was none
of them within r>oo feet of the street. The.
nag on the staff of the Capitol building
was at half-mast.
As the procession passed the executive
building every man in the parade turned
his face toward It in the effort to see if
Governor Taylor was watching the march.
There was no sign of life there, however,
although one of the windows was open
and the curtains fully up. Other windows
in the building were filled with soldiers
and some few civilians, but. there was no
fac? at any of the windows of the Gov
ernor's office.
It did not require fifteen minutes for the
line of marching men to pass the Capitol
grounds and all chance of trouble was
over. As the line reached Ann street,
upon which it was to turn south for the
march past the Capitol Hotel, where the
hearse and relatives of the dead leader
were to tajce their places !n the line,
there was a long wait of nearly an hour.
The rain was coming down heavily, and
before long all the marchers were
drenched to th* skin. A few of them
made runs for places on the sidewalk un
der awnings, but the majority kept their
places in the street and patiently waited
for the word to advance. The delay was
caused by the services in the parlor of
the hotel, which occupied more time than
it was originally thought they would. The
services in the parlor consisted merely of
a reading of the Scriptures by Dr. Talia
ferro of the Methodist church and a solo
by Mrs. Jessie B. Caldwell of Covington
and a prayer by Dr. Schmidt.
The march to the cemetery from the
hotel beijan at 1 o'clock. The band struck
up "Nearer. My God. to Thee" as it passed
the south front of the hotel, and .mnn I 
dlately after the band came carriages con
talnlrx the honorary nail-bearers, who
were as follows: J. S. Blackburn. General
Joseph H. Lewis, Judge W. S. Pryor. Hon.
J. B. McCreary. Hon. Phil B. Thompson,
Hon. James H. Mulligan. Louis Descog
r.ets. Samuel J. Shackelford. J. D. Rhin
ock. Joseph W. Pugh. Zach Phelps, W. B.
Haldeman, Charles B. Poynts and Morton
K. Yonts.
Beside the hearse walked the active
pallbearers, who were as follows: Jack
Chlnn. Charles C. McChord. Ed Fennell,
James M. Rlch?.rd?on. Henry George Eph
Lillard. Willanl Mitchell. Charles M.
I>ewis, John L. Grayot, John K. Hend ricks,
John Fulton. I'rey "VVoodson. Joseph
Blackburn Jr.. Allle w. Young, R. B.
Franklin and Percy H^ley.
All the pallbearers wore mourning scarfs
of Mack and tvhite draped across the
breast and their hats were wound with
the same' colors. Then came the citizens
on fcfot and a long string of carriages.
The procession was fully one mile In
length by the time the cemetery gate
was reached.
Around the freshly thrown up clay ani
open grave was gathered a throng of sev
eral thousand people, who waited pa
tiently for hours in the midst of the down
pour for the funeral cortege to appear.
For half an hour before the long proces
sion reached the cemetery the rain came
down in a perfect deluge, drenching every
one to the skin. But through it all tJv>y
waited, and when finally the hearse
stopped at the walk leading to the chapel
the thousands present stood silent and
reverent as the pallbearers slowly carried
the casket to the porch of the little chapel.
The rain was coming down heavily at
the time, and after a hasty consultation
it was decided to postpone the burial cr>.i
conduct the <-Â»remonies from the stens of
the chapel. "When this announcement was
made a perfect scramble to secure places
of vantage ensued- Rushing flown the
walks and driveways and over the. graves
every one moved toward the chapel, and
in two minutes the little building was sur
rounded by a clotely packed throng. As
the casket was placed' on the supports on
the porch of the chapel a quartet sang
"It Is Well With My Soul." every one
standing with uncovered head as the
beautiful words of the song were heard
through the storm. Rev. G. M. Stanley
of Virginia, standing over the casket, then
delivered a short prayer. This was, fol
lowed by the quartet, who sang "Nearer,
My God", to Thee."
Rev. T. X. Arnold, an old and intimate
friend of Governor Goebol. spoke briefly
of the earthly life of the dead leader and
eulogized him as one of Kentucky's great
est sons. After a solo by Mrs. Jessie
Caldwcll Rev. Gilbert Schmidt delivered a
short address in German. He was fol
lowed by. Rev. K. C. Mann in a short ad
dress. KldÂ»r William Stanley followed in
an eloquent tribute to Governor Goebel.
He spoke bitterly of the assassination,
speaking of the. "chagrin and mortifica
tion in the heart? of all that the leader of
a people whose proud boast it was that
they never feared to face a foe. or failed
to defend a friend should fall at the
hands 'of an assassin."
Senator Blackburn was then introduced.
There was much confusion when- the
white-haired Senator stepped forward,
and he was finally compelled to stand on
a table so that the throng might see him.
As Senator Blackburn's stentorian voice
rang out in his denunciation of the shoot-
Ing of Governor Goebel and as he stated
that it was "not the work of a crank or
a crazed assassin" murmurs of "No" and
"That's right" came from a closely
packed crowd, while tears stood in the
eyes of many of the grim-faced men with
in hearing of his voice.
At the conclusion of Senator Black
burn's sprrch Governor Beckham was ln
troducpfl to make the closing address of
the ceremonies. He\ too. was compelled
to climb to the table placed at the side of
the casket before the ' clamors of the
crowd ceased. Governor Beckham was
listened to with the closest attention and
as, with his face flushed and his voice
trembling with emotion, he concluded
with an appeal to th<Â» people of the State
to support him in his announced inten
tion to carry out the policy of Mr. Goebel,
applause was heard for the first- time.
Rev. Louis Wallace of the State Peni
tentiary thm pronounced the benediction.
As he finished the quartet sang "Amer
ica" and the body was taken within the
chapel. Guarded by a strong force of
deputy sheriffs armed with rifles, it will
remain there until the weather clears,
when it will be carried to the grave pre
pared for it and buried.

MRS. PHELAN LAID TO
REST IN HOLY CROSS
IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIES AT ST.
IGNATIUS CHURCH.
Many City Officials Present and
Large Crowds Unable to Gain
Admittance.
The respect in which the memory of
Mrs. Alice Phelan is held oil account of
her numerous charitable deeds was shown
yesterday by the scenes attending her
funeral, which occurred at half-past 10
o'clock at St. " Ignatius Church. By 9
o'clock the church was completely filled,
a denso mass of people who were' unable
to gain admittance crowding Hayes street
near the entrance to the sacred edifice.
When the funeral party arrived from the
late residence of the deceased at Seven
teenth and Valencia streets every man in
the black mass. 'of humanity removed his
â¢hat to do homage in the presence of the
dead. ' Â¦" 'â¢ .
Mayor Phelan, attending his sister
Molly, followed the remains as they were
borne to the chancel, in turn coming Mr.
and Mrs. Frank J. Sullivan, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Sullivan, Charles Delaney, Miss

Pond, J. Downey Harvey, It. D. McElroy,
J. F. Dunne, J. A. Farrelly, J. M. Bur
nett, Henry Hoffman, S. G. Murphy and
James Moffltt.
The relatives and friends were seated
at the right of the altar, the opposite side
being reserved for the city, officials and
representative members of various organ
izations, of 'whom a large number were
present. The Most Rev. Father Frieden
officiated as celebrant at the solemn re
quiem mass. He was assisted by Rev.
Joseph Hickey as subdeacon, and at the
absolution services by Rev. Father Me-
Kenna,
While the congregation was being seated
Dr. Maurice W. O Connell, who acted as
organist and musical director, rendered
Guilmant's "Prayer" and Tombelle's

choir consisted of the following: Rev.
Father Coltelli, J. H. Desmond, J. B.
Lane, G. Rowan and S. Hopcraft, tenors;
'G. V. Wood and G. Berger, bassos. The
choir rendered the following selections dur
ing the 'progress of the services: "Kyrie"
(Cagliero), "Nearer, My God, To Thee,"
"Lead, Kindly Light (Newman), "Libera"
(Cagliero), and the "Marche Funebre"
(Chopin), the latter being rendered as the
procession was leaving tho church. Two
solos were sung, "Pie Jesu" (Leybach),
by J. B. Lane, and "Fear Not Ye, O
Israel" (Buck), by J. H. Desmond.
At the concnislon of the service the
casket was borno from the church Â¦ be
tween long- lines of acolytes, flanking the
entrance. â¢ The interment was in Holy
Cross Cemetery and was strictly private.
â¢ The floral offerings were numerous and
of beautiful design, five express wagons
being required to convey them to the
cemetery. An urn four feet in height was
offered by a relative, while Tax Collector
Scott and employes sent a cross nearly
eight feet in height.
YOUNG PETER JACKSON.

YOUNG PETER JACKSON, the colored middle-weight, who Is to box Jack
O'Brien of Philadelphia before the National Athletic Club on the 14th
inst., is one of the rising men in his class. He has lately met and practi
cally defeated clever Tommy Tracey of Australia and has made a splendid
showing against some of the best men in the Northwest. He is training at
.the Ingleside House under the watchful eye of his manager and trainer.
Bishop. Jackson possesses great strength, is a hard hitter and is as quick as
a cat in his movements. He will make a good opponent for O'Brien, and
followers of the sport are of the opinion that the Philadelphia^ will have to
bring all his science into action to defeat the dusky middle-weight. O'Brien
does not hold Jackson too cheaply and is training hard at Blanken's Six-mile
House. He is already in fine fettle and premises to show local sporting men
that he has hitting power and will do even better than he did when he met
Al Neill.

Head of the Franklin
Syndicate Caught.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â William F. Mil
ler, the head of the notorious Franklin
Syndicate in Brooklyn, which promised
lo pay, and did pay to many persons, 520
per cent on Investments, and who fled
when he learned of his indictment by the
Kings County Grand Jury for grand lar
ceny and conspiracy, was to-day brought
back to this city. He had eluded capture
since November last. .
Miller was in the custody of Captain
Reynolds, formerly of the Brooklyn De
tective Bureau, who lost his place through
his failure to prevent Miller from leaving
the city. The prisoner was arrested in
Canada on clews picked up a few days
ago. Captain Reynolds and his prisoner
arrived from Canada at 2:30 o'clock to
day and at once went to police headquar
ters, where Miller was introduced to Chief
of Police Devery. Miller was in a pood
humor. He did not seem at all put out
or disturbed by being in the hands of the
police or in the slightest fear as to the
future.
Chief Devery was very anxious to find
out something of Miller's doings since he
left the city, but Miller positively de
clined to say a word in that direction.
According to a statement made by Chief
of Police Devery Captain Reynolds found
Miller in Montreal. Captain Reynolds re
fused to go into the details of his search
and discovery of Miller. He said that
several days ago he was furnished with
clews of Miller's whereabouts and was
instructed by the Chief of Police to get
him if he could. In following up the clews
Captain Reynolds said he ran across a
man who knew Miller. The movements
of this man he followed until the latter
and Miller met. Captain Reynolds would
not say where this meeting occurred. Ac
cording to Captain Reynolds Miller was
not taken by surprise. The captain told
him that as they were In Canada he
would not arrest him, but would follow
him wherever he went. Miller replied that
he was going back to Brooklyn. Captain
Reynolds said that he did not place him
under arrest until they reached the Grand
Central Depot, when he showed the war
rant of the Kings County Grand Jury.
Miller took the matter very calmly. He
looked very seedy', his clothing is sollei
and ho lacks the air of a man who has
made a fortune.
Miller was taken from police headquart
ers to Brooklyn and arraigned beforo
Judge Hurd in the County Court. He was
held in |12i500 bail, which he was unable
to furnish and was then . transferred to
the Raymond-street Jail.
Three indictments had been found
against Miller, two charging grand lar
ceny In the first degree and one grand
larceny in the second degree.

FAIR "PENCIL" DEEDS.
Action Against Mrs. Craven Argued
in the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court Justice? Garoutte, Van
Dyke and Harrison listened all day yes
terday to oral arguments in the case of
James S. Angus, executor of the estate
of the late Senator James G. Fair, against
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven. After Fair's death
Mrs. Craven produced two pencil deeds
to valuable realty claimed by the estate.
One is the Clay Greene property on Mis
sion and Twelfth streets and the other
Is located on Pine and Sansome streets.
The notarial acknowledgments were by
James J. Cooney. I
In the Superior Court Judge Slack
decided that the deeds and acknowledg
ments were forgeries. Mrs. Craven made
a motion for a new trial, which la Â¦ still
pending in the lower court, and at the
same time she appealed to the Supreme
Court from the Judgment of Judge Slack.
In the latter action, which is now on
hearing, the main question Is whether
Judge Slack. ruled correctly when he de
nied Mrs. Craven a trial jury and allowed
her only an advisory jury. He held that
the action was in equity and not in law,
entitling her to a jury trial. These and
other legal questions were argued at
length yesterday by D. lA. Delmas for the
plaintiff and W. M. Pierson and Garret
McEnerney for Angus, and Charles S.
Wheeler, representing .the Fair children.
During the entire session - Mrs. Craven
and her daughter, Mrs. Margaret Koehler,
were present and interested listeners.
The argument will be continued to-day.

Hairdresser Made Her Sick.
A suit was filed yesterday in the Jus
tice's Court by Mary Thackham against
Rose Bergold, in which the plaintiff al
leges that the defendant is a hairdresser,
doing business at 220 Post street, and she
employed the latter to dress her hair on
December 30 last. Miss Thackham com
plains that the said hairdresser so care
lessly dressed her hair and in so doing
used euch harmful and deleterious sub
stances that she was rendered sick and
NO PENSION FOR CLARKE.
Important Supreme Court Decision
Upon an Old Police Law.
Alfred Clarke, who for many years
was a member of the police force of
San Francisco in the capacity of clerk
in the "upper office," has lost his suit
against the Police Life and Health Insur
ance Board. The action was a petition for
a writ of mandate to compel the board to
grant him a pension under one of the old
laws. Clarke was a member of the force
from 1556 to IS6S, when he went out, only
to be reappointed again In 1569, resigning
in ISS7 on account of ill health. He served
an aggregate of thirty years. In 1883 an
act was passed by the Legislature provid
ing" pensions for policemen serving over
twenty years and being over 60 years of
age. This pension was established at one
half the amount of the salary drawn by
the officer on retirement, but the matter
of granting it was optional with the
board.
Clarke in his action relied upon the fact
that his term of service aggregated more
than twenty years. The Supreme Court
hold that his .contention was not well
taken, as he had left the department be
fore the law mentioned had been passed.
The court says: "We think it clear from
a reading of the amended section that It
has no application to one whose connec
tion with the department was at an end
before the passage of the amendatory
act." This decLslon reaches beyond tho
Clarke case, as 'several officers have be
gun or contemplate actions along the
same lines of that in the case at bar.
CORONER COLE BLAMED.
Insecure Trap Doors Caused the
Death of Bernice McClellan.
Many unfavorable comments are being
made respecting the management of the
Coroner's office, it being stated that the
relatives of Miss Bernice McClellan have
been . hampered in the way of obtaining
evidence for damages by the manner in
which the case was handled by the Coro
ner. Miss McClellan was killed last Wed
nesday evening by falling down an eleva
tor well in the building of the Standard
Biscuit Company at the corner of Front
and Pacific streets. The Coroner's office
was notified, but none of the deputies
went to the scene of the accident to view
the body or to remove it, and it was al
lowed to be taken to an undertaker's.
Coroner Cole was asked yesterday why
this unusual course was taken and he
frankly acknowledged that the fault was
his. Dr. Leland, the Morgue Surgeon, had
telephoned him about the affair and in
formed him that the girl's neck. had been
broken, at the same time asking permis
sion to let the undertaker selected by the
family remove the body. The permission
was given and the body was taken away
without any of the deputies seeing it.
"It was an oversight on my part," said
Coroner Cole. "I am yet green in the bus
iness and so are my deputies. They are
not to blame. I gave the order and I
will stand responsible for it, but I admit
that I was in the wrong and I don't in
tend that it shall happen agajn."
Investigation yesterday showed that the
unfortunate girl had been the victim of
frail and insecure trap doors which pro
tect the openings in the floors after the
elevator has stopped running. Tho doors
had all been closed, as the employe of the
biscuit company stated, but the slight
weight of her little body caused one of
them to give 'away when she stepped
upon It. The quality of the traps which
covered the openings on the lower floors
may be imagined when it is known that
her descending body tore them from their
fastenings and dropped to the ground
floor.
The building itself is the property of the
Fair estate. Jt is said that accidents of
a similar character have occurred in the
place before, and a great deal of blame is
placed on the heads of the owners for not
affording better protection to the inmates
of the structure.

Cole Gets Another Trial.
The case of Joseph S. Cole, convicted in
Monterey County of murder in the second
degree, has been sent back to the lower
court for another trial. The man was
convicted of causing the death of his sis
ter-in-law. In the lower court much im
proper testimony was allowed to be In
troduced, and even the District Attorney
-was permitted to question the wife of the
defendant along lines not recognized by
law. A further reason for reversing the
judgment was that the court made a num
ber of errors in its instructions to tho
Jury.

packing up their personal belongings, and
during the early spring they will start
trekking over the mountains and plains- to

EXPECTS A BIG
ATTENDANCE OF
EPISCOPALIANS
Bishop Moreland Is
Here Again.
Right Rev. W. H. Moreland, Bishop of
the Protestant Episcopal diocese of Sac
ramento, has returned to his home after
three months spent in the Eastern and
Southern States. He was accompanied
on the trip by his wife and two children.
They left In the early part of November
and went direct to Nassau, N. H., and
from there to various other States, Bishop
Moteland filling pulpits In nearly every
city on the route.
: Starting from Boston Bishop Moreland
visited Hartford, Conn., New York, Phil
adelphia, Flushing, L. 1., and Brooklyn.
In his -addresses he took every advantage
that offered to draw attention to the Pa
cific Coast and' to the many attractions
of this State. Bishop Moreland did a
great deal of missionary work In .the in
terest of the general convention of the
Protestant Episcopal church that is to be
held in San Francisco in 1901.
','1 am happy to be able to report that
there is likely to.be a very big attend
ance of delegates at the convention,"
he said yesterday. "This convention will
bo a very representative gathering, as it
will. include merchants, lawyers, bankers
and all classes of laymen as well as
clergymen from all parts of the country.
Everywhere I went 1 found great interest
manifested in tho general convention,
more particularly because it is to be held
on the Pacific Coast. In New York I met
J. Pierpont Morgan, who was chairman
of the convention that selected this city
as the place of holding the big gathering,
and he assured me that he would use alll
his Influence to secure a low railroad fare
that would induce many to visit this
coast. In all the dioceses through which
1 passed I met the bishops and clergy and
impressed upon them as much as 1 could
the great opportunity they will miss if
they do not come to the coast in Octo
ber, 1901. The encouragement that I re
ceived justifies me in saying that there
will be a splendid attendance at the con
vention. "
Two months of Bishop Moreland's time
was spent in traveling and doing mis
sionary work in the interests of the con
vention, after which he went to his old
home at Charleston, S. C, and spent a
month with his parents, who still reside
l h fx c - 3? 6 Poached there several times
before his return to take up his work in
the diocese of Sacramento.
Bishop Moreland and family will reside
Â»i n Fran c'sco till October, when they
will remove to Sacramento to reside per
manently.
MILLIONAIRE'S

Judge Troutt did not admit the will of
the late Julius Friedman .to probate yes
terday and the document must bear the
brunt of a contest before its legality can
be definitely determined.
When the petition to admit the will to
probate was called by Judge Troutt yes
terday Attorney Joseph Rothschild asked
that the proceedings be postponed for a
few days until I. Friedman of Portland,
Ore., a cousin of the deceased, arrived, as
that gentleman wished to be heard be
fore the will was admitted to probate.
Attorney Riordan, who represents the ex
ecutors of the instrument, and Wallace
Â¦Wise, who guarded the Interests of the
Jewish Old People's Home', argued against
a continuance, but a hitch in the proceed
ings resulted in an adjournment until
Monday. Mr. Rothschild then formally
filed a contest of decedent's will on behalf
of himself and other cousins, who reside
in Oregon. In the contest it is alleged
that the document is not entirely in de
cedent's handwriting, that the testator
was of unsound mind when he .executed
the instrument and that undue influence
was exercised over the . deceased by va
rious of the â¢devisees.
Decedent's estate is valued at $700,000
and an exciting contest is anticipated.

CROOKS IN JAIL AT SACRAMENTO
SUSPECTED OF OAKLAND MURDERS
11^ R. M. Gordon, alias Harry Frier; Charles Avery,
alias Henry Spellman, and Alfred B. Newman, ar
rested at Sacramento early in the week shortly after
they had committed a robbery, the police of that and
this city are not only firm in the belief that they have
men guilty of many hold-ups In this city, but are like
wise of the opinion that they are the men that killed
Saloonkeeper Thomas and shot Robert Vincent, a butcher,
in Oakland. Working on that theory, the police of this
and the city across the bay are looking up the records of
the men.
It has been found here that Avery and Newman
stopped for a long time at the New Adelaide House, 614
Howard street. They had been patrons of the house for
about seven months, but were never steady lodgers. The
place is a 10-cent lodging house and the clerk well remem
bered the two men. He cays that Newman's chum is not
Avery, but J. J. Becker.
"I never knew what their business was," said the
clerk, "but they would tell me that they could easily make
from thirty to forty dollars every week they were away
on little trips to the country, and that it was better than
working. After being away for a few days they would
return and would have plenty of money. They would stay
long enough to blow it all In and then would tell me that
they were going away again to the country
"A few days ago they told me that they were going to
Sacramento and they had just about time to get there.
"I am sure that the man who calls himself Avery is
the man I know as Becker."
The more recent crimes of which the men under arrest
are suspected are the shooting of John Thomas, a saloon
man at Pacific and Campbell . streets, Oakland, on the
night of November 12, and the shooting of Robert Vin
cent, a butcher, on December 9 of last year.
At the period these murders were committed Oakland
was the scene of many desperate robberies and shooting
affairs. 'Â¦
Thomas was In his saloon about midnight when two
men entered, ordered him to throw up his hands and, be
cause he did not do so quickly, one .of the robbers shot
him through the brain. He died three days later. s
Robert Vincent, a butcher, was carrying the receipts
of his Saturday's trade from his shop to his home, when
he was commanded to halt by two men. As soon as he
st?Â»rÂ»ed to run he was shot and seriously wounded. Dur
ing :he same months some other bold robberies of sa
locr.s took plaÂ».-e at midnight in Oakland and the police
could find no clews, stating that they believed the jobs
were being done by crooks who crossed over from San
Francisco. For a time there was a reign of terror along
the water front district, where all the crimes were com
mitted.
About the same time an attempt was made to blow up
the safe of the Oakland and Alameda Railroad Com
pany, but the workers were so clumsy that although they
exploded much dynamite and raised an alarm, they did
not succeed In opening the safe. After the Standard Oil
Works job. about the end of December, there was a sud
den end to robbery and murder in Oakland, and since
then that city has been free from big crimes.
JORDAN'S WORDS
STIR SPEECH IN
UN EX-CONVICT
Peter Boyle Delivers
a Message.
IT IS FROM MEN IN PRISON
ATTDEETfCE AT THE ACADEMY
OF SCIENCES STIRRED.
?
President David Starr Jordan's lecture
on "The Rise of the Common Man." de
livered last night in Academy of Sciences
Hall, resulted in a discussion of the pres
ent policy of the Government and criti
cisms thereon that at times brought the
audience to its feet in thunderous ap
plause. One small statement of the
learned president of Stanforfl formed the
basis for the argument of two succeeding
Fpcakers, who enlivened the lecture in a
manner all the more interesting because
unexpected.
The lecture of President Jordan was de
voted to a demonstration that the com
mon man has been moving to a condition
of equality before the law, which the
ppeaker regarded as the ideal of democ
racy. It was In reality an advocacy of
the present system of American govern
ment, in which the enemies of advance
ment along economic lines were designat
ed ac the aristocracy, militarism, slavery
and imperialism. War and conquest the
lecturer regarded as the greatest of evils.
Hardly had Professor Jordan taken his
peat and the applause subsided when a
man arose and requested permission to
sneak. He was recognized by Chairman
Thomas Beresford and. advancing to the
rostrum, spoke In a manner so convincing
that a pin could have been heard to drop.
"Friends," he said, "my name Is Peter
Boyle. I am an ex-convict and I make
the confession in public because I have
just come here from Folsom to deliver to
you a message from the men confined
there because they so requested me with
tears In thelr.eyes. Professor Jordan has
told you how to improve society and yet
has left out a most important subject,
the subject of penology.
"You send men to the State prisons and
then forget them, but I want to tell you
that they are treated worse than at simi
lar Institution? in Siberia. I saw a China
man shot down in cold blood because he
went to the water's edge to get a bucket
ful of water, and yet he had never been
told not to do it and had done it a hun
dred times before. The same man that
shot this Chinaman shot a crazy man to
death in ISSS because to tried to walk
away from the prison in broad daylight,
right under the puns. I was put in a
dunseon so often that the aggregate made
more than two years. I once tried to see
Warden Aull. and for even asking this
right, was put on bread and water for
peven days. They watched me and caught
me keeping notes of what I saw and burn
ed thÂ« notes before I left. These men are
absolute monarehs and if I did not think
no country can become free from crimi
nals when men are treated like this, noth
ing could induce me to get up here and
publicly announce what I am. The state
of things at Folsom is something awful
and the proper authorities ought to pay
more attention to criminology and penol
ogy."
Th<Â« sensation of thÂ«* evening was a
speech of S. Seller, a local music dealer,
against expansion and the "legalized
murder" necessary to such a policy, in
which he uÂ«ed Boyle as an Illustration of
a part of his argument.
"Our system is wrong in many re-
FrÂ»ects." he declared in impassioned tones.
"I do not think that crime and a general
tendency to vlciousness and pauperism are
elxn-ays inherited. If the last speaker was
the child of bad parentsâ which I know
nothing about â and had been taken av.Â«iy
from them and reared by proper people
in a crood environment, it Is highly prob
able that he might never have been In a
prison.
"I believe that this gray-headed man
whom Jesus at least would have associat
ed with and tried to reform. If reared un
der proper conditions, would have been
better than all the pious frauds from
Joshua down. He would not have gone
forth to murder the Filipinos because a
few men wanted to make campaign ma
terial for use In running for office again.
"Many is the American mother who is
proud to-day that her son is fighting for
h1Â« flag under the Philippine skies. What
will she say when she finds out that she
has been duped? What will she say when
Fhe discovers that the boy who returns
to her with hands stained with human
bloodâ with the blood of his fellow man
or, worse Ktlll, who returns to her cold
and ptark en a bier. Instead of 'fighting
for the flag' has been murdering others
or has been murdered himself simply for
the srlory of another man?
"We prate of Justice and fair play, but
we haven't Been fit to accord it to these
poor Filipinos by any means. We talk

Royce, a well-known farmer, was shot
and killed this evening at his home twelve
miles from this city by his grandson.
Frank Royce. Frank Royce left this city
this afternoon in an intoxicated condi
tion. When he reached Dixie he became
involved in a fight with Rufus Woods,

Frank Royce drew a rifle and shot at
Woods, but missed and the bullet killed
his grandfather. Young Royce then fired
several more shots at Woods, but with

DEMISE OF A VERY
PROMINENT JOURNALIST
Passing Away of Beriah Brown, an
Intimate of Horace Greeley, and
Founder of Papers Here.
ANACONDA, Mont.. Feb. B.â Beriah
Brown, probably the oldest newspaper
man in the Middle West, died here at
10:30 o'clock to-night at the advanced age
of 84 years. Death was due to old age,
superinduced by an attack of la grippe.
Mr. Brown was born in New York State
In 1814. He was an intimate friend of
Horace Greeley and the two were room
mates and fellow workmen â¢Â¦ for a long
time. He was a prominent figure in the
constitutional conventions of Michigan
and Wisconsin, lending his aid In estab
lishing the first State government in
each of these States. For half a century
he has been engaged in newspaper work
on the Pacific Coast.
He was the founder of the Democratic
Press of San Francisco, which afterward
became the Examiner. - At the time of
President Lincoln's assassination he was
the object of a mob bent on, lynching him
because of his condonence of that crime
Afterward he went to Mexico, where he
was a foremost figure in th"c organization
of the colonization scheme, the district to
be settled by people of the Confederate
States. This plan wan nullified by the
death of Maximilian. He afterward en
gaged in newspaper work on the Pacific
Coast again. He started the first daily
newspaper In the State of Wa*hinyton
the Puget Sound Dispatch, at Seattle, and
conducted the Democratic Herald at Port
land.
He was Mayor of Seattle in 1879 and
1880, - when ' his health became Impaired
and he was compelled to retire from ac
tive life.
He leaves four sons, one of whom is a
city official of Seattle, another news edi
tor of the Post-Intelligencer at Seattle a
third city editor of the Spokesman-
Review at Spokane, and the fourth city
editor of the Anaconda Standard.
His remains will be shipped to Seattle
for burial.

AWAIT SENATE'S ACTION.
Fate of New Reciprocity Treaties
Hinge on That of the French.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â Before pro
ceeding further with the construction of
the new reciprocity treaties the State De
partment will await the action of the
Senate upon the pending French treaty.
Should this fail all efforts to effect the
reciprocity scheme as contained In the
Dingley act will be abandoned. It is
probable, too, that even in the event of
the continuance of the negotiations a new
plenipotentiary must be found on the part
of our Government to carry forward the,
heavy work which has fallen to the share
of Mr. Kasson.
LUMBER MARKET
IN THE ORIENT
Captain Cates Says Op
portunities Are Good.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
VANCOUVER. B. C. Feb. B.â Captain
Cates of this city has Just received a let
ter from James Robertson of San Fran
cisco and Puget Sound, proprietor of the
Robertson Raft Company. Robertson
went out to China two months ago to in
vestigate conditions of the lumber trade.
He writes that he Is well satisfied that a
lot of American lumber can be shipped to
both China and Japan. A large amount
of public work Is to be done in Japan dur
ing the present and next year, and rail
way construction in China will make a
profitable market there. He states prac
tically, that he Intends early In the spring,
as soon as he returns, to send a large
timber raft In tow of a tug or steamer
from Puget Sound or British Columbia to
Japan. The raft will be of between fif
teen and twenty million feet.
Mr. Robertson may make arrangements
specially for the erection of a mill near
Yokohama before he returns. Captain
Catos built the first raft on Robertson's
patent years ago in Nova Scotia before
the company operated on the Pacific
Coast at all. and both he and Robertson
say that the raft plan is Just as feasible
for going across the Pacific all the way as
from Puget Sound to San Francisco, a
voyage that has several times been suc
cessfully accomplished.
The voyage from the straits of Juan de
Fuca to Yokohama would probably take
nearly a month, but it would contain
nearly twenty shiploads and could under
fairly fortunate circumstances be han
dled for a fraction of the cost of sending
separate shiploads.
PORTO RICAN
BILL FAVORED
New Tariff Measure to
Be Reported.
WASHINGTON. Feb. B.â The House was
in session an hour and a half to-day and
only minor business was transacted. The
Ways and Means Committee measure es
tablishing tariff rates on goods from
Porto Rico into the United States and
vice versa was reported, and Chairman
Payne gave notice that the bill would be
called up next Thursday. The debate
upon it will run for a week. .
The Republicans of the committee, ex
cept McCall of Massachusetts, agreed to
report in support of the bill, devoting a
considerable portion of their arguments to
sustaining the contention that the clause
of the constitution, declaring that "all
duties, imposts and excises shall be uni

not applicable to our new possessions,
which, they say. are not United States

DR. J. ELLIS RODLEY
CONVICTED OF PERJURY
Physician Swore That He Signed the
Fuller Will Which Was Proven
to Have Been Forged.
OROVILLE. Feb. 8.-Dr. J. Ellis Rod
ley was to-day convicted of perjury on
the first ballot. The jury was out but ten
minutes. He will be sentenced to-morrow
morning: at 10 o'clock.
Dr. Rodley is a prominent physician of
Chico, the largest town in Butte County.
He swore that he signed the last will and
testament of the late Alfred Fuller, which
pave $30,000 to Mrs. S. M. Houseworth.
The validity of the will was tested and it
was proved to be a forpery. The trial was
replete with sensational incidents- and
much contradictory testimony was given
In all probability Dr. Rodley will now be
placed on trial for forgery, as the prose
cuting attorney announces that he would
press the case on both counts.

COMMERCIAL MUSEUM WORK.
SHOULD the people of San Francisco need any
outside inducement to urge them forward in
the enterprise of establishing a Commercial
Museum they can find it in the reports which are sent
out from time to time by the Commercial Museum
in Philadelphia. No American institution of recent
years has been so successful as that, nor does any
perform a more important work for the country at
laree.
The proof of its usefulness is to be seen in the
rapidity of its growth and the wide extent of its ser
vice. It was started by a number of enterprising men
in Philadelphia immediately after the Columbian Ex
position in Chicago. It is. therefore but a few years
old, and yet it has already obtained a site including
fifty-six acres, has property in the way of real es
tate, buildings and exhibits valued at nearly $1,500,
000, has an appropriation from Philadelphia of $115,
000 annually, and other sources of income amounting
to about $60,000. To all that it is fairly certain of
adding a considerable aid from the National Govern
ment, as a bill is now before Congress appropriating
$200,000 for the purpose of increasing the exhibits of
commercial articles from all parts of the world.
As an evidence of the need for such an institution
a recent report directs attention to the fact that our
merchants and manufacturers are hardly aware of the
full extent of the foreign demand for American goods.
During the past year our exports of manufactured
goods exceeded $325,000,000 in value, and yet the
trade found the American producer but partially
supplied* with the information required to handle it
intelligently" and to the best advantage. It has been
the task of the. Commercial Museum to supply that
information, and during the past twelve months
some 19,000 reports were sent out to American manu
facturers regarding commercial conditions abroad,
and over 20,000 communications directing attention
to immediate opportunities for selling goods in their
specific lines of trade in different parts of the world.
From the accomplishment of so much in Phila
delphia the people of San Francisco can draw inspira
tion and encouragement in the prosecution of the
movement which has been undertaken here. It is not
to be expected that we shall build a museum so vast
as that in Philadelphia, for we have neither the pop
ulation, the wealth nor the commerce to sustain it,
but in proportion to our opportunities and our pros
pects we may reasonably expect success.
It is to be borne in mind that when once the Pa
cific Coast Commercial Museum has been established
we shall have support from the East, for the enter
prising men of that section are aware of the increas
ing importance of the trade of the ' Pacific; Ocean and
will cordially co-operate in a movement designed to

SANTA BARBARA' PRESS,
The selection of Thomas R. Bard for Senator meets with marked approval.
There would be a. unity of wisdom Jn the election of Mr. Bard to the United
States. Senate. He Is capable, he Is honest, he Is a good Republican he hall* from
Southern California; these are the four principal elements In the case He should
be elected, as he undoubtedly will be. Personally we are more than pleased be
cause he Is our neighbor. He will reflect credit on the office and the deadlock
will be broken. We are glad also because^ Southern California Is entitled to It.
Be It remembered that there are competent men in the southern half of the Stnte
as well as in the northern. This is our political inning. All In all it Is a good and
wise selection from whatever point you view It. We sincerely hope to salute our
distinguished citizen as United States Senator from and after Tuesday next Â¦
poor and being honest are incompatible. The Ex
aminer thinks that only the rich are honorable, and
that poor men must be ruled out of public life for
lack of honor! Being poor, the Examiner thinks, is
prima facie evidence that a man is dishonest, dishon
orable and unfit for a public trust! We deny all
this. We affirm that many a man is poor because he
is honorable, because he has refrained from dishonest
methods to get rich, and we affirm that many a man.
who began life poor has acquired wealth by the hon
orable practice of self-denial, thrift and temperance,
which were his guiding principles when he was poor.
"Honor and fame from no condition rise," but are
the elemental characteristics of poor and rich alike.
There is a feasible advocacy of the popular election
of Senators that is based in a prospective improve
ment in administration, and that will keep every
State's representation in the Senate complete, and
will rid the Senate of the constantly arising contests
for scats in such cases as have occupied it ever since
1793. This advocacy is not based on any slander of
the poor, nor in any assumed corruptibility of State
Legislatures. The addled Examiner does not stop
to think that if its indictment of the poor men who
are elected to the Legislature be true, to take from
them the election of United States Senators is to de
prive them of the least frequent and most rare oc
curring opportunity for corruption. Senators are
elected for six years. In some States Legislatures
meet every 3'ear, and in none is their meeting less
frequent than every two years. Judged by the Ex
aminer standard members have at every session the
opportunity to make hundreds or thousands of dol
lars by simply saying "Aye" instead of "No," or
"No" instead of "Aye," on the passage of bills.
Again, the people elect legislators, and if they
choose those who are as dishonorable as fhe Ex
aminer charges them to be, when they also elect
Senators what assurance is there that they will on
the same ballot elect dishonorable legislators and an
honorable Senator?
The Examiner's argument is that the people, hav
ing shown themselves unfit to be trusted to elect an
honest Legislature, have thereby proved themselves
fit to elect an honest Senator! Having been unfaith
ful over few things, the Examiner proposes to com
mit to them many and greater things!
All of this is based upon the Examiner's "ru
mors." Because it has started a rumor that Senator
Bard's seat was bought for $100,000, it insists upon
popular election of Senators. Applying its reason to
the people, according to the testimony of rumors
from its own political household, they should not be
allowed to vote at all. Colonel Bryan has often set
afloat the rumor that the whole people of the republic
were bribed in 1896 in the election of a President.
Therefore, according to the Examiner logic, all
elections should cease because of a rumor that the
electors are corruptible, and especially because that
paper thinks that poor men are unworthy of trust.

POPULAR ELECTION OF SENATORS.
THE Examiner has discovered reasons for the
popular election of United States Senators
which are somewhat amusing, and at the same
time are a revelation of that degraded' sheet's" ideas of
public morality. Recurring to its own false and in
famous charges of corruption in the election of Sena
tor Bard, it says that its own rumors of such corrup
tion "may or may not be well founded. But that they
are in circulation at all is significant." ' Yes, it is sig
nificant of the absence of conscience and lack of
truthfulness, decency and honor of the Examiner, and
of nothing else.
That paper then continues that: "Most of the men
who go to Legislatures are politicians. Most of
them are poor * * * and find the salary paid
them by the State insufficient to meet their expenses.
And when the chance comes to make some hundreds
or thousands of dollars by merely saying 'Brown'
instead of 'Jones' when their names are called they
are often not able to resist the temptation. * * *
The remedy for this state of affairs is simple. It is
to transfer the election of Senators from the Legisla
tures to the people. Then the ordinary possibilities
of corruption will be shut off, for to purchase a ma
jority of the voters is an immensely more difficult
matter."
It is the Examiner's belief, then, that" poor men
have no honor. That they are dishonorable and dis
honest, take bribes and sell their votes because being

THE BATTLE OF CANALS
1â;1 â ; ROM the earnestness with which the people of
I New York are discussing the advisability of
. largely improving the Erie canal, it is evident
they do not intend to let their trade pass away from
them to other American points, or down the Canadian
canals, without making a vigorous fight to retain it.
The contest will be something like a war of canals,
for each side is to do its best to construct the most
convenient waterway by which the immense traffic
between the interior of the United States and Europe
can be carried from one country to the other.
For some years past New York has been losing
the degree of its pre-eminence over the other ports of
the Union. The decrease is particularly notable in
grain exports. Philadelphia, Baltimore, Newport
News, New Orleans and Galveston each have a
larger percentage of gain than New York in the
grain trade since 1893, and in 1899 Baltimore shipped
absolutely more corn than New York, the ship
ments being 46,000,000 bushels for the one to 40,000,
000 for the other.
The shifting of- trade in these instances has been
due to the diminished cost of shipping grain by rail.
Grain shipments by the Erie canal are subject to
transfer charges at Buffalo and at New York City,
while those sent by rail pass directly from Chicago
or other grain markets of the interior without break
ing bulk to the wharves where they are to be loaded
upon the ocean ships. It is the Canadian compe
tition, however, that New York fears most, for the
improved canal system of that country threatens to
make an open way for grain to be shipped straight
down the St. Lawrence to Liverpool, without any
transfer at all.
For the purpose of meeting the coming competition
Governor Roosevelt has recommended such an en
largement of the Erie canal as will enable it to ac
commodate vessels of a cargo capacity of 1000 tons.
It is estimated the improvement will cost upward of
$60,000,000, but the magnitude of the expenditure
does not appear to affright the taxpayers, for the
recommendation is generally approved.
It is to be noted that the improvement of the Erie
canal to the extent projected will virtually put an end
to the much talked of scheme of constructing a na
tional deep waterway from the lakes through the St.
Lawrence and Lake Champlain to the Hudson River.
That scheme has been a favorite one of Chicago, but
New York does not approve it. The argument of
the objectors is that if the United States Government
construct a waterway by which ocean-going ships
can pass from Chicago down to a point on the St.
Lawrence from which a canal could be opened to
Lake Champlain, there would be no reason why the
ocean ship should not keep straight on down the St.
Lawrence and go to Liverpool without turning aside
for the sake of passing through New York.
The situation is one .that calls for vast enterprise,
and the enterprise will be forthcoming. Of course
Chicago will get the benefit either way. Canada and
New York are striving to provide a deep waterway
which will virtually make Chicago an ocean port, and
Chicago will not have to pay a cent for it. In the
meantime the railways, and the ports that have been
built up by railways, will have to meet the competi
tion as best they can..^ : "Â¦

REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES.
THE Republican League of Oregon has pub
lished the declaration that the sound money
question is a paramount political issue as long
as either of the great parties advocates the free coin
age of silver. It declares its adhesion and reaffirms
its loyalty to the gold standard, and its opposition to
the silver standard which would follow adoption of
the principles advocated by Colonel Bryan. The Ore
gon league also declares that the Republican party
was formed to fight the battles of free labor, to be
the champion of the people, and of the American la-
These declarations are all timely and will have their
effect upon the sound money sentiment of the coun
try, which will stand to its position until the em
pirical propositions which have threatened public
credit and private prosperity are abandoned and no
party stands for them. Since the issue of abolition of
slavery no public question has taken as deep hold
upon the American people as this. It will not be for
gotten nor its hold relaxed until the last danger of
reaction and its consequent ruin has disappeared.
Colonel Bryan may flatter himself that his attitude
will gain accessions this year from the allied forces of
sound money, but we invite him to undeceive himself.
He may fancy, too, that he can win by avoiding an
issue which he prominently incarnates. No matter in
â¢what disguise he presents himself, his personality sug
gests nothing but his onslaught upon sound money
and his grudge against all that has made for Ameri
can prosperity. American labor weighed him in the
balance and found him wanting in 1806, when taking
counsel of its condition of distress it was in a posi
tion to be tempted by promises. The full soul
loathes even the honeycomb, and full labor this year
will certainly not. crave the glucose substitute offered
by Colonel Bryan and his party.
The declaration in Oregon is a needed starter for
the campaign. That State was saved by an earnest
combination and alliance of its sound money men.
Their junction was timely, for the free silver taint
had thoroughly penetrated the Democracy and was
making its septic and deathly way into the Republi
can party. The voice of such a State on that subject
is heard to the far borders of the Union, where the
money issue will be paramount as long as sound
money is in danger.

THE NEW CONSULAR BILL.
FOR many years past there has been an agita
tion in commercial- circles for reform and im
provement in our consular service. The agita
tion has increased with the increase of our export
trade, and, it is safe to say, will not cease until the
demands of the merchants and the needs of the
country have been satisfied by enactment of a law pro
viding for an American consular service equal, if not
superior, to that of any other nation.
A year ago the leading commercial bodies of the
country appealed to Congress to effect a reorganiza
tion of the service. The last Congress, however, was
too much occupied with war questions to take up the
subject, and accordingly the consular service bill pre
pared at that time was not acted upon. At this ses
sion the issue is brought forward in a bill which has
been introduced into the House by T. E. Burton of
Ohio, and on the same day into the Senate by Sena
tor Lodge of Massachusetts. The bill was drawn up
by representatives of large commercial organizations,
after consultation with officers of the State Depart
ment and others who have had experience in the con
sular service. It is, therefore, a well considered
measure and is probably preferable to any other bill
of the kind that has been submitted.
The bill provides for nine classes of Consuls. The
highest class are to receive a yearly salary of $5000
each, the lowest class are to receive $1500 each. All
fees, official or unofficial, for consular services'are to
be accounted for and turned into the treasury of the
United States. Within six months after the passage
of the act the President. is to classify the consulates in
accordance with the provisions of the law, and within
two years all present incumbents are to come home
and pass examinations as to their fitness for the
service. Each new Consul when appointed holds for
a year on probation, and during that time may be
removed at the will of the President.- If he prove
worthy and retain his office beyond a year, he cannot
then be .removed except for cause.
Two features of the bill are especially interesting.
One of these places the consular corps at the orders
of the President in the . same way as the army and
navy. Thus the Government, can at any time detail
a Consul to report for duty at any part of the world
where his services may be deemed most valuable.
The other permits the assignment, by the President's
order, of any Consul to special duty in the United
States for a period of not more than one year at a
time, and permits the nomination to consulates with
out examination of persons who have been in the
classified service of the State Department for at least
two years, thus creating an interconvertible service,
and making experience in the foreign service avail
able, for the home office, and experience in the home
office available for the foreign service.
If the bill become law the consular service will be
no longer a part of the spoils of politics. It will af
ford a permanent career for men who choose to enter
it. The young men who are to graduate from our
College of Commerce may rightly aspire to eminence
in it, and will not have to become a part of the push
and pull of politics to attain it. It is full time for the
reform to be achieved, and it is to be hoped Con
gress will find time to deal with the issue at this ses
sion.

CLOSE OF THE SESSION.
BY the election of a United States Senator, and
by the passage of every bill before it which can
be accounted of any importance to the State,
the Legislature has now achieved all that is re
quired of the extra session. It should therefore ad
journ on Saturday. That is what the people expect
and demand. Let the session be closed without de
lay.
There are many reasons why such a course should
be taken. In the first place, all has been done that
ought to be done. There remains nothing for the
consideration of the Legislature except a few patron
age bills in which the public has no interest. Every
day of the session entails a large expenditure of
money and an increase in the burdens of the tax
payers. Nothing can be accomplished in another
week or another month which will justify the expense
of a continuance of the session.
Up to this time the action of the majority of the
Legislature has been harmonious. The Senatorial
contest has been brought to a satisfactory and a
speedy conclusion, and the important measures for
whose consideration the session was called have been
promptly passed. If there be a continuance of the
session solely for the purpose of passing patronage
bills there are almost certain to result vexatious
wranglings which will prolong the session and dis
gust the people.
For the sake of the taxpayers and for the credit of
the Republican party the session should be brought
to a close. The people will hold the Republicans of
the Legislature responsible for the waste of money if
there be any, nor can it be doubted that to prolong
the session will be accounted a waste.
The issue is too plain to be avoided. The duty of
the Legislature is to be satisfied with what has been
well done; close up and quit; adjourn Saturday
night.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1900.
AS TO THE DEATH
OF SISTER CORA
Editor of the Call: Having returned
this morning from an extended absence
In the East, I have made it my first duty
to search the files of the San Francisco
papers for information touching the death
of Sister Cora.
This good sister was for nearly two
years under my pastoral direction while
rector of St. Luke's Church, and for a year
was a member of my own household. I
was the recipient of her confidences, and
the bond which united us was unusually
close, as it could not help being, seeing
that she was daily ministering to the poor,
sick and distressed under my direction,
and making to me an almost dally report.
I feel it my bounden duty \o protest
against the imputation of suicide which
has been made relative to her decease.
She was found dead on the floor of her
room at 1513 Jackson street on January 18
last, and the autopsy showed the presence
of carbolic acid in her stomach, which
fact gave color to the suspicion of suicide,
although the Coroner's Jury declared, af
ter having the evidence, that they were
doubtful whether' the poison had been
taken purposely or by accident.
I wish to give to the public certain facts
in my possession which will, I feel sure,
convince reasonable people that this
cheerful, bright-faced, consecrated woman
did not commit the fearful crlmÂ© which
has so lightly been charged upon her. 1
know positively that Sister Cora was in
the habit of using carbolic acid as a
gargle for her throat, for I have heard
Bishop Moreland Tells What He Knows About the
Good Woman's Untimely End.
her speak in praise of its efficacy scores
of times and describe how many drops of
the powerful add should be used in water
It is also a fact that in the sisters
room, where B he was found remaps
of an egg were discovered, some of which
was smeared upon her face, and a dish of
milk from which the top had been re
moved. Her body. too. was found near a
window of her room, toward which her
hands were stretched out. It seeras al
most certain from these facts that Sister
Cora, when gargling her throat for the
niffht accidentally swallowed the potson
and Immediately began preparing an
emetic, meanwhile moving toward the
window, but falling and dying before she
could find relief. Certainly, these facta
are entirely inconsistent with the theory
Furthermore, I wish to state that Sister
Cora had received personal assurances
from me of a home and a field of laborâ
of the former immediately, of the latter
prospectivelyâ and while she was natural
ly anxious and uncertain about her plans
this uncertainty was not sufficient to
prompt the cowardice and Infamy of self
murder, even if such a thought could ever
have entered so sound and sane a mind
and so true and faithful a heart.
In Justice to the memory of this good
sister, I hasten to communicate these
facts to your columns, feeling sure that
by their publication you will Dring com
fort and relief to many who loved her In
life and who wish to revere her memory
now that she is taken from us.

REMAINS OF LAWTON
IN STATE AT WASHINGTON
liOng Journey of the Funeral Train
Across the Sea and the Land
Is Finally Ended.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. â The train bear-
Ing the remains of Major General Henry
W. Lawton completed Its trip across the
continent at 9:30 o'clock this morning.
Adjutant General Corbin met the party at
the depot, and Troop H, Third Cavalry,
from Fort Meyer, acted as escort to the
Church of the Covenant.
Carriages were waiting for those who
accompanied the dead general, and they
left the station before the remains were
removed from the train. Mrs. Lawton,
her son Manley and her daughters were
the first to enter the carriages. Mrs.
Armstrong, widow of Major Armstrong,
whose remains are to be interred at Ar
lington, followed. General .Shatter, with
his aids. Lieutenant E. T. Wilson and
Colonel C. E. Edwards, was next con
veyed from the station.
The massive casket, draped with the
national colors and covered with flowers,
was then carried to the hearse by sol
diers of the Fourth Cavalry and Four
teenth Infantry, who accompanied the
funeral party on the special train.
The cortege then moved slowly to the
Church of the Covenant, on Connecticut
street, where the remains will He in state
until to-morrow, when the funeral will be
held at Arlington Cemetery.

WASHINGTON. Feb. B.â The -adjutant
general received a telegram from Colonel
Gillesple, Corps of Engineers, at -New

The news came as a great shock to the
many friends of the deceased ofHcer at
the War Department, who were not even
aware of his serious illness. Lieutenant
Benyaurd was one of the most distin
guished officers of his corps and had a
particularly brilliant record during -,r the
War of the Rebellion. He was In charge
of the river and harbor works at New

Fender Saved a Life.
J. Fenmore, a bootblack residing at 427
Valley street, owes his escape from deatn
to a real fender on car 1175 of the Mission
street line. While he was alighting he lost
his footing and fell in front of the car.
The motorman, with great presence of
mind, dropped the fender in time to pick
Fenmore up. He was quickly released
from his perilous position and sent to tho
railway company s hospital, where Dr.
Miller found that his injuries consisted of
a sprained ankle and numerous bruises.
I said the document was Intended only as
a review of the State's principal products.
Wheat still continues the staple crop, the
yield of 1599 being worth $21,000,000. Bar
ley, corn and oats were lesser crops, the
area of which will probably not oe ex
tended. Fertilizing wheat nelds in Aus
tralia has proved to be very successful
and the board has undertaken some ex
periments in this direction which it will
report next year. The grain grown on
the fertilized tracts will be shown at the
State Fair in 1900. The Eastern shipment
of fresh fruit last year was the heaviest
ever sent out of the State. The quality
was good and the prices satisfactory.
One hundred and twenty-three carloads
of fresh fruit were sent to Europe with
success and profit, and this market may
develop to large proportions. The dried
fruit product was somewhat short, but
the prices were good. Organization by
the producers was urged and honest pack
ing recommended. Dried fruit shipments
to Europe have rapidly Increased and
promise well. The prune crop was heavy
and good, but prices low. Orchardists
were recommended to join the new asso
ciation. Over 3.000,000 cases of canned
fruit and vegetables were packed in 1599.
The raisin crop was short, but as a re
sult of the growers' association the prices
were good. The growing of citrus fruit
has been extensively engaged in. Cali
fornia now standing second only to
Florida as a producer. Prices of oranges
and lemons have been good and the busi
ness is profitable. Olives, flgs and nuts
are grown in quantity and excellence suf
ficient to supply the American market.
Wine-grape growing has been productive
of profit and the conditions warrant
further planting. Phylloxera has attacked
our vines and further planting should be
on resistant stock. Adulteration should be
prohibited by strict legislation.
An interesting review of the beet-sugar
industry by Claus Spreckels was incor
porated in the report. Seven hundred thou
sand acres of land In California is suit
able for sugar-beet culture. The condi
tions here are more favorable than else
where In the United States, tho beets
richer in saccharine, and beet-growing is
rapidly developing and improving the
State.
Hops grow to a higher perfection ami
are freer from disease than elsewhere. In
California there has never been a crop
failure, and here is grown about one-third
of the amount consumed In the United
States. Prices are low at present and fur
ther planting Is discouraged. About 2.000,
000 pounds of honey are produced per an
num. The blossoms, flowers, sage and clov
ers make as good honey as is grown in the
world.
California horses are famous all over
the world, ' and from them is derived a
large revenue by sales In the Eastern
States and in Europe. Only good-sized,
good-dlsposltioned animals should be bred.
The breeding of a high class of road
horses Is advised, and farmers are urged
to breed for some special purpose, and
aim to produce some special type. Horse
men should look to the islands and tho
Orient for a good market.
The cattle supply is now short, but un
der conditions found here can be rapidly
made up. California has no cattle plagues,
no blizzards and cattle reproduce rapidly.
The type of cattle is good and they are
well bred. More pure bred cattle should
be bred here, and breeders . should en
deavor to beat the Nevada herds, which
have beaten them for the last three yeara.
Texas fever is confined within narrow
limits and 13 now well under control.
Dairymen have not made the progress
they should under existing favorable con
ditions. The Dairy Bureau reports many
herds - producing. less than 100 pounds of
butter per cow per annum. A report from
three excellent herds is given. Holstelns
in the San Joaquin Valley, owned by Mrs.
M.-E. Sherman, produced 339 pounds- of
butier per cow. Alfalfa-fed Shorthorn
marks of approval from the Right, min
gled with laughter from the Left.
Dr. Schadaler declared the Centrists
could not suooort the hill in its present
shape. He added that the revenues of the
country were receding, and that the pro
gramme could not be carried out unless
new taxes, amounting from 100.000,000 to
120,000.000 mark 3, were raised. Dr. Schad
ler concluded with declaring that the
Centrists did not fear the specter of the
dissolution of the Reichstag.
Herr yon Levetzow, the Clerical leader,
said a great majority of the Conservatives
favored the bill.
Herr Froehm. Social Democrat, declared
his party was strongly opposed to the bill.

Joost's Fence Makes Trouble.
Behrend Joost and some of his neigh
bors on the line of Douglass street and the

that has been erected by Joost on a piece
of his property. He asserts that the land
from Seventeenth street south along Doug

property. He says that Corbett road be

street. This contention Is disputed by
some of the people. Several boys under

a few nights ago, with partial success.
The Board of Public Works Intervened In
the dispute and gave Joost notice to"' stop
building fences across public streets until
the court settled the disputed territory.

OLD MAN WAS SLOWLY
STARVING TO DEATH
Thomas Burden, an old man living at
4322 Twenty-fifth street, was found in his
hut by Policeman Rotanza. slowly dying
from starvation. He was In such a piti
able condition that he was sent, by the
officer to the City and County Hospital,
where he now lies In a precarious condi
tion. Burden had not been seen about
his shack during the past three days and
his neighbors became apprehensive. They
expressed their feara to Officer Rotanza.
and when ha entered the place he found
Burden lying on a rough couch in an un
conscious condition.
An investigation disclosed the fact that
the poor old man was too weak to rise
from his bed of sickness and prepare food
to sustain him. A meager larder was dis
closed, and everything pointed to the rea
sonable supposition that Burden had not
touched a morsel of food In three days.
Burden has no relatives In this city.. He
has always been considered eccentric.

SACRAMENTO. Feb. B.â The annual
meeting of the State Board of Agriculture
was held this afternoon and A. B. Bpreck
els was unanimously elected president.
Secretary P. J. Shields presented his an
nual report.
In nominating Mr. Spreckels for re
election Director Frederick Cox paid a
high tribute to that gentleman's services,
saying that the unprecedented success of
the last exposition was in a large part due
to his energ-etic efforts. With him as
president there could be no doubt that
the success of ISD9 . would surely be re
peated in 1900. Very pleasant relations
between the members had resulted from
Mr. Spreckels 1 administration.
Director Johnson Indorsed the state
ments of Director Cox and President
Spreckels was unanimously re-elected.
Director Frederick Cox was elected vice
president. Director W. P. Mathewa was
again chosen superintendent of the pa

GERMANY'S NAVAL
BILL IS READ
Notable Scene in the
Reichstag.
PROMINENT MEN PRESENT
ADMIRAL TIRPITZ SPEAKS FOB
THE MEASURE.
BERLIN, Feb. B.â The first reading of
the naval bill took place in the Reichs
tag to-day. The house and the galleries
were crowded. The First Secretary of the
Admiralty, Admiral Tirpitz; Secretary of
the Interior Count Wehner and Secretary
of the Treasury Baron Thlelman were
present. A photographic apparatus was
conspicuous in the gallery for the purpose
of reproducing the historic scene. Ad
miral Tirpitz, in introducing the bill, said
the historical events of the last two years
had spoken In such clear language that
the necessity for a strong fleet for Ger
many had been recognized In ever-widen
ing circles in the country. Those in favor
of a great navy and those opposed to It
differed essentially in regard to the scope,
date and period for carrying into effect
the increase of the fleet, and also con
cerning the form In which the question
should be dealt with. But the reasons for
increasing the navy could be summed up
in a few words. The discrepancy between
Germany's naval power and that of other
countries was so great that the Federal
Government saw therein a distinct dan
ger If allowed to continue. Indeed the
danger appeared all the greater, as the
commercial competition of the world, ac
cording to all calculations, would become
more severe during the next decade. Any
one desiring to examine the question of
the navy must clearly understand it is
impossible to improvise navies. On the
contrary, many years are required for
their establishment. Least of all is it
possible to improvise navies in the hour
of danger. With this fact, he added, Ger
many will have to reckon.
The creation of navies, the Secretary of
the Admiralty continued, not only pre
sents difficulties of a financial order, but
above all is a question of material. Ships
and their crews, squadrons and their com
manders cannot be conjured up with a
stamp of the foot, but with the accom
panying dockyards and harbor works
accessory thereto, they need long prepa
ration. He recently had the opportunity
to point out to the House that Germany
cannot know what adversary she may
some day have to deal with, and that it

was therefore necessary to adopt the
principle of providing for the most dan
gerous opponent. The most dangerous
war for Germany to be In would be one
In which her army could not be used at
the outset. In such a war Germany
would require solely a strong fleet. On
the German coasts Germany's fleet of
cruisers would not suffice in such a war
in view of her geographical situation, to
break the blockade or pass through the
hostile straits. i: >

continued, "or rr.an them without crew 3?
Where is our fleet to get coal during this
time? What would be happening to our
coast? If, however, Germany developed
the fleet her battleships would have to be
sent to the bottom by an enemy before a.
blockade, or even an attack on her coast
would be possible. During a war it would
be difficult to protect our merchantmpn on
the high seas. Therefore such a war must
be altogether prevented by a strong fleet.
The provisions of the bill coincide with
the statement of the Government in pre
senting the budget. It increases the ef
fectiveness of the navy and ships are kept
in commission. The concluding paragraph
becomes purposeless, but for technical
reasons it could not be eliminated. Our
object is to place a second fighting fleet
alongside the old one, but independent ol
it, like two army corps.
"As regards the number of ships to con
stitute a fleet, we have adopted the maxi
mum number possible to a one-man com
mand, and there would still remain the
question whether the proposed doubling
of the navy is sufficient and as to whether
the dangers existing at the present time
are removed or are considerably reduced
by the bill. We prefer to leave that ques
tion for discussion In committee. We
think the necessity of increasing the num
ber of ships on foreign service is gener
ally admitted. The cost to 1920 is calcu
lated at 500.000.000 marks, or 40,000.000
marks annually. At a moment when we
are about to effect a considerable increase
in the fleet it appears Inexpedient to break
the loan system. Unless a fixed, immov
able loan is determined upon further dif
ficulties will arise in the navy itself with
our present hand-to-mouth way of pro
ceeding. The Federal Government is so
penetrated witii the sense of the necessity
of the bill that they have declared it im
possible to wait any longer. We hope the
House will convince itself of the necessity
of the bill:"

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. S. â There was a decided
falling off to-day In speculative Interest of
outsiders in the stock market. There was a
considerable degree of activity and some ir
regularity, but it was largely due to the
closing up of speculative accounts on either
elie of the market by professional operators.
While the market seemed to be largely in the
hands of professional operators It was singu
larly free from professional manipulation so
fcr as could be detected. That Is to say the
professional bulls manifested no disposition to
bid up prices where there was evidence of
any outstanding short Interest, but were con
tent to devote their attention to the liquida
tion of their profits. On the other hand the
bÂ«ars showed no aggressiveness in offering
down prices where realizing was In evidence,
but centered their attention on covering up
their own short contracts. While this covering
demand from, the shorts was in evidence in
a nuntier of conspicuous stocks the predom
inant disposition was to take profits by selling
out Ion? llrif-B. The center of the demand from
ehorts wajs Sugar and some of the other ln
iJuFtriaiF, including one or two of the metal
proup. ghowrd sympathy. Others of the metal
grouii. the local traction and the railroads
generally shewed the effect of realizing all
day. The profit-taking was conducted In an
orderly manner and without any such violent
movements of prices or activity of trading as
vat the cas<Â» yesterday. The high opening in
sympathy with London helped the profit-taking,
but prices wÂ»-re Renerally higher. There was
continued absorption of Union Pacific after
the reaction which followed the dividend an
nouncement and the railroad list generally
â¢wan well In hand, prices being rallied to
facilitate realizing. It was reported that the
Union Pacific had decided to close the Ogden
gateway, which caup^d some heaviness In the
railroads which have relied on that outlet for
traflic to the Northwest, notably Burlington,
Itock Island and Missouri Pacific. The local
traction stocks, which have shown themselves
repponoive to developments In the rapid tran
Â»'.'. tunnel project, were weak on the announced
decision to accept the contractor's bond. The
ptormy weather prevailing in the West per
hafs had none effect on the railway list. The
announcement of a bond issue by the Western
Union Company of twice the amount firet re
ported ve*tf-rday caused weakness in that
Â«tock. The expectation is growing that Satur
day's bank statement will not show the money
j^witlcn Â«>trer.ijtheniÂ»<i, as the receipts from
the Interior have shown a falling off, owing
In paj-t to a renewed demand from the South
to accommodate a cotton movement stimulated
by the higher price. It Is obvious that the
gain made by the banks early on the sab
tr<=-asury oi>era.tions will bÂ« about wiped out
before the end of the week. There is an In
creased riartiallty for the railroad stocks as
collateral as a result of those developments.
There are a few pains on the day's trading,
but net losses are the rule.
The bond market was moderately active and
showed r^ccs^lons nt some points. Total sales,
par vtlue, 11.051.n00.

I L .. h * last f Â« w days. Consols advanced
6-16 to 101 9-16. London was inclined to ad
vance Americans, but New York, after buying
j, a Â» minutes, sold heavily Union Pacific
ana Atchlson preferred. Later the pressure
from New York lightened, but the close was
/ a Â£ 7 h " Continent did nothing. The Bank
or England bought Â£11.000 gold in bars.
Money rates were unchanged, but the tendency
was easier. Bills, however, hardened a little
after the bank return came out.

COFFEEâ C. E. Blckford's circular gives the
receipts at this port In January at 15,989 bags,
against 10.466 in January. 1539. The sales from
first hands were 10,903 bags, against 7511. The
stock In first hands February 1 was 11.1-34 bags,
against 10,261 last year. The world's visible
supply February 1 was 6,162,003 bags, against
6.555.114. The circular says:
"Rising markets have been the rule every
where since our circular of January 6. The
causes have been numerous: Confirmatory esti
mates of 9.0C0.000 to 9,500.000 of bags for the
growing Brazil crops â nowadays not regarded
too large; bubonic plague scare at Rio and
Santos, which ports have been since officially
declared free from this infection; abnormally
heavy and steady reduction in official figures
of the world's visible supply, the decrease since
October 1 amounting to 1,474,000 bags: and
lastly but not least, sentiment, which has
proven one of the strongest factors. There Is
no doubting now that prices went unwarrant
ably low, and with this ilrm platform as a basis
coffee could move in but one direction If given
only the slightest encouragement. The enor
mous decrease in visible' supply Indicates move
ment rather than consumption, and It will be
interesting to note at some future time how
much of this disappearance will make Its re
entry to be sold again. Locally, business has
been very active, but somewhat hampered by
the paucity In first hands of moderate priced
coffees, to which qualities the demand mainly
runs. In addition to the list of importers' sales
given below fully 10.OX) bags in the aggregate
have been turned over several times between
dealers. Low grades ore In great request and
relatively higher than any other description.
The markets close from steady to firm at the
advance.
"Stocks In first hands consist of 23 bags Costa
Rica, 53 Nicaragua. 2271 Salvador. 8458 Guate
mala and 2671 Mexican; In all 13.479 bags, as
against 9163 bags same time last year."

CHICAGO, Feb. B.â Breadth, strength and
animation were shown by the wheat market
and foreign buying, caused by further reports
that the French crop had suffered severely,
was the feature. Paris was up equal to 2c
a bushel here and was reported taking all
offers made over night. The Irresponsive at
titude of Liverpool to the advance here yes
terday had a discouraging effect early. May
opening Vie lower at 6S'A@6BV6c. A reaction
followed by reason of the prediction of a
severe cold wave, the better tone of later
Liverpool cables and the French advices. May
was bid up to 69>4@69>4c. There had been talk
of considerable export business, but New York
reported only eleven loads taken, which caused
some Helling, which, combined with vigorous
profit-taking by traders, resulted In a reaction
which sent May to 68V4c, at which that option
cloned firm, but only a shade over yesterday.
The corn market was strong and trade fairly
active. May cloned %@Uc improved at 33% c.
The oats market was firm, but not active.

Provisions were very active and proportion
ately strong, pork at the best being up 12%@

TEN -HOUR SHIFTS ALL BIGHT
Decision of Judge Heacock on the
Navy Yard Cases.
T.*nlted States Court Commissioner Hca
cork yesterday dismissed the case of the
United States seainst the Atlantic. Gulf
and Pacific Company, charg-ed with vio
lating the Federal eight-hour law.
The evidence was that the defendants
had a contract with the Government to
remove a lanr* scow that had been filled
with earth and rock and sunk at Mare
Island as the foundation for a Ujrhthous**
The scow was in the way of the work of
building the new drydock. The d^fend
"ants worked two fhifte of men of ton
hours each, and put In the defense trat
if they, did not work the shifts ten hours
jkt day they would be unable to com
plete their contract, because the other
contractors would build around them ani
t-hut them out. This fact, they claimed,
made th*> work cne of emergency.
The Comrcip-sioner decided that the work
was one of emergency and discharged the
defendants.
When United States Attorney Coombs
hoard what bad been done hÂ« proclaimed
h!Â» Intention of bringing a test case be
fore United States District Judge -In
Haven through an Indictment by the
Federal Grand Jury of one of the other
contractors at Mare Island for a similar
offense. Mr. Cocmbs said that the emer
srency mentioned in the Federal statute
Â¦was an emergency authorized by the Gov
ernment, and that the Intention of the
law traa not to allow the contractors to
be the Judges whether a work was one

SCATTERED HIS
GOLD TO THE
FOUR WINDS
Jones' Fortune Was
but a Shadow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Feb. 8.
The death of William P. Jones of Ala
meda a few days ago revealed a peculiar
state of his finances. His estate was val
ued at about $30,500, while it was supr>osed
that he was nearly a millionaire. He was
president of the Oakland Home Insurance
Company, at one time a wealthy corpora
tion, and he was interested in many en
terprises, some of which were success
ful, and some not. This gave him the
reputation of being very wealthy, but it
would seem that these very enterprises
were the cause of the loss of a large sum
of money. Through an ever readiness to
assist friends in financing their schemes
he lost at least one fortune. - â¢Â¦"â¢" â¢ â¢â¢
Jones was a pioneer. He crossed the
plains in '4S and for many years was em
ployed as superintendent with the Bel
iir.gham Bay Coal Company at an exec
tionally liberal salary. He was frugal ki
his ha&its and economical, and he soon
amassed a fortune. He invested in real
estate, adding to his riches, and when he
came to Oakland in 1579 he was worth at
least $150,000.
Here he was one of the founders of the
Oakland Home Insurance Company and
was made its president, a position he re
tained for fourteen years. When the
company went up in IÂ«S4 about $00,000 of
Jones' money went with it.
Previous he had been one of the heavy
lnsers in Consolidated Virginia stocks.
Just how much he dropped In these he
never confided to even his closest friends,
but it was estimated at 130.000 at the least.
Early in the 'SO's he invested about
So"**) in an enterprise known as the Went
worth Boot and Shoe Company. This
proved a losing venture, as did also $6000
placed in the Oakland Glass Works. Be
sides Jones was a loser to the extent of
about $25,000 in the French Bank failure
some twenty-five years ago. In each In
stance he invested on the recommenda
tion of supposed wise friends.
A few years ago Rev. Albert T. Per
kins, then rector of Christ Church. Ala
meda. discovered a method of preserving
fruits In transit. He resigned his rector
ship and devoted his entire attention to
the enterprise and the International
Transit line was formed. In it Jones sunk
$10,000. and among the listed worthless as
sets of the estate Jones holds a note for
$4Â»J made by Perkins, who has since
passed to the great beyond. In the same
category are found numerous other notes
for greater or lesser amounts which
perhaps will never be realized on. And
what was left of the wreck he bequeathed
to Mrs. Susan Lanktree. who had been as
a mother to him through his last twenty
one years.

Thn^e pasyer.pers are reported to be
rr.iffing. ar.d their bodies are supposed to
be under the burning wreckage, but their
names could not be ascertained.
The sast freight train was making about
fifty miles an tour, forging ahead -through
a blinding snowstorm, which made it iÂ»n
poeslble to see the signal lights ahead.
When within 1*) yards of the switch at
Fcrd River Er.gineer Green s*w the rear
lights cf a train directly ahead ar.d with
a warning cry to his fireman. Jumped.
The r.ext ir.stant the heavy freight struck
tfce passenger coach of the accommoda
tion and telescoped it and the baggage car
ahead. The dozen or' more passengers
in the cstr had not a moment's warning
before the crash came and a moment later
the cries of the injured could be heard
shove the hiss of escaping eteam and
crackle of the tlanies which soon envelop
"(l the wrecked cars and made the work of
rescue doubly hard. As fast as the In
jured passengers were removed they were
taken to a store a short distance away
Â«rtUlÂ« thÂ« train crew fousht desperately.
assisted by the uninjured passengers, to
fit} control of the f.re. which threatened
the destruction of the wreck.
A relief train was sent fern this city to
the scer.e of the disaster. Immediately
upon Its arrival the work of rescue was
rushed with renewed energy and at ID
o'clock it was announced that all the in
iured had been removed. But the bodies
of the three unknown dead ar.d two
train n:en are still pinced fast in the
bw&Sss baggage car, all effort to reach
then fcavirg proved futile.

NO COURT STENOGRAPHER.
Judge Fritz Attempts to Take the
Evidence in a Felony Case in
Long Hand.
The dictum of Judge Carroll Cook that
Police Judges must in the absence of
a stenographer take the testimony in
locg-hand in felony cases was obeyed by
Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon in the
case of William Watson, engineer for tile
Southern Pacific Company, charged with
manslaughter. Watson wag In charge of
the specfar from San Jose Sunday morn
ing. January 14, which ran over and killed
Miss Rose Lawler at the crossing of Sev
enteenth and Harrison streets.
Tbe preliminary examination was set for
yesterday afternoon, but neither of the
court stenographers was available, and
rather than disappoint the witnesses the
Judge decided to proceed and take the
evidence in longhand.
Watson made a long statement detail-
Ing the circumstances leading to the ac
cident, which was practically a repetition
of his evidence at the Coroner's inquest
and the Judge laboriously took It down
word for word. Then he got tired and
gave up the Job, continuing the case till
next Tuesday, when he expressed thiÂ»
hope that he would be able to procure the
services of a stenographer.

Mlle. Trebelli's Farewell Concert.
Mile. Antoinette Trebelll's farewell con
cert at the Grand Opera-house yesterday
afternoon was a success of the most un
qualified kind. The large auditorium was
well tilled and the audience most enthusi
astic. Mile. Trebelli sang a number of
songs in which she had success at prior
recitals, and responded to several encores
with her accustomed graciousness.
The programme was varied and as In
teresting as all her programmes, have
been, ft began with "Vous Que Me
Fuyer." from Duvenoy*s "Helle." which
is one of the strongest things Mile.
Trebelli has sung. The "Laughing Song"
was given by request, and. of course, met
with the same enthusiastic approval that
has always greeted it.

ALAMEDA, Feb. S.â Miss Lena Schnei
der and Henry Peter Schneider were mar
ried this evening at the home of the
bride's parents, 2025 Clinton avenue, by
Rev. A. Hazerodt of the German Lutheran

An interesting fact In conneetioa with
the affair is that the bride and groom be
came lovers in Germany. Miss Schneider,
â¢while on a visit to relatives in the father
land two years ago. met the young man
whose wife she became to-night.
It was love at first sight. Before the
departure for home of the young lady
their engagement was announced, and it
was agreed that as soon as the fiance
could adjust his affairs he would come to
California. He arrived a year ago and
now has a confidential position with a San
Francisco firm. No relationship existed
between bride and groom, although they
bore the same name.
The bridesmaid was Miss Julia Fjord
and the best man Peter Gayhart.

WHAT IS BEST
AT THE ORPHEUM
THE SOHLKES are in their second
week at the Orpheum and Papinta is
In her third, yet between them they
do more to make the show worth
seeing than any cf the other factors or
actors of the current programme. They
should not be missed, for to see them Is
to be pleased in a more or less sensa
tional way, and that is the sort of thing
(sufficiently rare, it is true) that . man
agers are eternally endeavoring to afford
us. It does not make so much difference
If you should sleep through Mr. and Mrs.
Perkins Fisher's act. "The Half-Way
House," a sketch by Ezra Kendall. lhe
author, who, ty the way. is one of the
teenest and cleverest monologisrs In the
profession, has not done himself justice
n the skit, but rather an injury, for Ita
mixture of dullness and strained wit re
jects anvthine but credit unnn him.
Although the Fishers are the principal
features of the bill, they are in point of
fact its only weak spot. Of the others a
person named Michell does a varied negro
specialty with considerable originality and
more than ordinary humor.
The Sohlkes and Papinta, who as I re
marked are the biggest and best attrac
tions, are both assisted In their acts by
other people, who are as Important, or
more so. than the principals themselves.
In one case th<?y consist of a band of five
tiny niggerettes, who are very much In
evidence, even to their coffee-colored
peels, and in the other of a corps of in
visible electricians.
Madam Sohlke takes a very active part
In the general movement of things, and
her partner, a sort of human top, helps
out nobly. There is plenty of movement
In their act; In fact. It is all movement,
and when four little cocoanuts with brown
bodiea and limbs attached fall from four
unsuspicious looking palm trees and go
dancing over the stage to a cakewaik ac
companiment you simply. In the parlance
of the pave, have to give It to them.
To drop in at the Orpheum and see Pa
plnta's fire dancr and other terpsichorean
color schemes is well worth one's while,
and if you don't catch anything but the
biograph this week you will be repaid.
The view of the Gordon Highlanders in
fighting trim is simply a tremedous spec
tacle. These magniflrent men, marching
proudly and raising cheers from thos* who
see them only through the medium of an
electrical machine, is certainly one of the
wonders of whatever century this may l*e.

EDSON F. ADAMS
REPLIES TO THE
CITY COUNCIL
Legislators Drew His
Wrath.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1113 Broadway. Feb. 9.
Edaon F. Adams doesn't like the Oak
land City Council and the Oakland City
Council loses no love over Edson F.
Adams, if the wording of a resolution
adopted at the meeting last evening
means anything. Mr. Adams at that tim*
wanted to reply to the resolution, but was
denied the privilege. To-day he- wrote hi*
reply to the Council.-
The struggle was over the laying of &
sidewalk around some of Mr. Adams*
property. . First the walk was ordered,
ar.d then Mr. Adams asked permission to
do It himself. This is the resolution wblca
granted the permission: -
Resolved. That EAson F. Adams bÂ«Â» and
he -la hereby granted permission to con
struct a bitumen sidewalk six feet wide on
the southerly side of Twenty-f jurth street.
between Cemetery Creek bridge and the
southerly line of Bay place. Neither the
passage of this resolution nor anything con
tained therein shall be construed as an ad
mission on the part cf this Council or of
the city of Oakland of private ownership of
the premises over which said sidewalk Is
to be constructed, or of the property abut
tins thereon.
This is the very tart letter seat by Mr.
Ontlemer.: In retard to my Detitloa to
lay a sidÂ«walk on Twenty-fourth 9tre*t, I
will say that there seems to bÂ«s great oppo
sltioa to our laying this walk la front c.i our
property. There seems to be a desirs on
the part of gome people to raakÂ« it j. - - ...
that thÂ« City Council Is forcing us to lay
thlÂ» walk. The facts are. that Deoole liv
ing on Vemoa Heights requested ua to lay
this walk of about IK) feet. I petitioned
the City Council for permission to fill In
said sidewalk, which request was promptly
granted.
Being a deep fill and uncertain rrourid. tt
seemed advisable to let the- fill settle bef >rÂ»
laying the walk. In the meantime the city
undertook proceedings under the general
street law to lay thÂ» walk from "Webster
street and Oakland avenue. The time for
fllin* bids expired on October 30. 1339. OvÂ»r
seven weeka afterwani, on Decrabfr U,
1^39 I petitioned to lay this waik. and tf
permission had been granted the walk would
have been constructed over a month and a
half aro.
The provision proposed by thÂ» City At
torney to be added to the resolution grant
ing me the right to construct this sidewalk.
which refers to the ownership of this land.
Is uncalled for aad unwarranted slander
against the title of this property. Respect
fully ETDSON* T. ADAM 3.
AGED MOTHER'S
PITIFUL PLEA
FOR HER BOY
Begged He Be Not
Sent to Folsom.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Feb. 8.
"Oh, my God! Judge. In mercy don't
send my boy to Folsom. Oh. not to Fol
som. He has always been a good boy
and I know he is not bad at heart."
Thla was the pitiful plea of the heart
broken mother of Frederick C. Dannaker.
who had pleaded guilty to a charge of at
tempted burglary and who was up before
Judge Greene to-day for sentence. And
having shriekted the words through the
courtroom the aged mother fell In a
SWOOn. Â¦Â¦"'Â¦,'â¢ : ;ii :
Before sentence was pronounced T. E.
Guther, John D. Adams and Mrs. Danna
ker each testified as to the previous good
character o| the* young prisoner. The
mother also declared that her son had
supported her ever since his father's
death two years ago and that he had al
ways been a good boy.
Judge Greene, while he felt sympathy
for the mother, declared the law must
take its course. McCoy and Downing, her
boy's accomplices in the attempted bur
glary of a local gun store, had each been
given five years' sentences. However. In
view of Dannaker's youthâ he Is 23â and
the showing as to his previous good char
acter, the court made some allowance,
pronouncing his sentence as three years
at Folsom prison. As -the sentence was
pronounced Mrs. Dannaker made her piti
ful plea. She is poor and unable to pay
the fare as far as Folsom. â¢

VICIOUS FIGHT
OVER A REMARK

Weapons Were Drawn
in the Battle.
â ?
HAYWARD3. Feb. B.â An uncompli
mentary remark casually dropped and re
flecting upon a pretty bride of 15 sum
mers was the cause of an encounter be

wedding, and John Silva. it is said, in
speaking to Antone Laurence told him
that Kelley had made an uncompliment
ary remark about the bride.

with the idea that he ought to lick Keller,
both for what he is reported having said
as well as on general principles, salilrd
forth looking for him. He met Kelley en

sued. â¢ Before friends could interfere
weapons were drawn, but, fortunately, no
one was damaged save the principal com
batants, who were welt used up.

One of the swellest affairs in the Mis
sion this season was given last night by
the Sine Cura Club at Hinman's Hall,
this being their sixth hop. The affair
proved a delightful success to the many
young people present. The club, a very
popular one in the Mission, takes great
pride in these hops, and though urged to
give many more, limits Itself to one or
two each season.
The success of the occasion was due
mainly to the following, ,who composed
the reception committee: George F.
Welch, Julia Kenefick. John E. O'Connor,
Loretto M. Lahaney, Minor Q. Leddy and
Margaret E. Collum.

YOUNG WOMAN
DRINKS POISON
Suicide of Miss Hill at
Paradise.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
CHICO, Feb! B.â Yesterday afternoon at
Paradise, in this county, Miss Sallle L.
Hill, a highly respected young woman,
committed suicide by taking carbolic acid.
The girl had been busy assisting her
mother in the household duties until noon,
and after dinner she went to take a bath.
Nothing more was seen of her until about
3 o'clock, when she rushed into the sit
ting-room screaming, "Mother, I have
drunk all the carbolic acid in the house."
Sne then ran through to her room and fell
on the bed. A doctor was hastily sum
moned, but the girldled at 3:30 in great
agony.
The father, when interviewed, said that
he feared some love affair was responsi
ble for the girl's action, though her man
ner had not Indicated that her mind was
troubled. Deputy Coroner Collins will
bold an inquest to-morrow.
BIGGY MAKES MORE RAIDS
Japanese Women Said to Have
Been Victimized by Bogus
Police.
Acting Chief of Police Biggy, with Ser
geants Donovan, McMahon and Duke,
raided the houses of ill-fame conducted
by Japanese women last night. About
seventy-five prisoners were taken to the
California-street station, forty-eight of
them being women and the others Chi
nese, Japanese and white men, who were
charged with having visited houses of ill
fame.
Since the acting Chief determined to
closes house of ill-fame in Chinatown and
raided those occupied by Chinese women,
the Chinamen have been visiting the Jap
anese houses. When Biggy learned of this
he caused Sergeant Helms to raid a Jap
anese house about three days ago and
had the inmates brought into court. The
cases were dismissed on technical grounds
yesterday, and last night the acting Chief
resumed his work by arresting every Jap
anese woman engaged in immoral prac
tices in the Chinese quarter.
Twelve fan tan players were arrested
by Officers John Galliway and Thomas W.
Handley on Jackson street. The police
men made a clever capture and secured
all the paraphernalia of tho game. They
visited the place during tho fore part of
the evening, as a ruse, and left, allowing
the impression to be made on
the Chinamen that they were sat
isfied that everything was straight.
While they were in the place, however,
they unlocked some secret doors, and by
means of these they gained entrance to
the gaming apartments a short while
later, just as the Mongolians had settled
down to a little game, thinking they had
hoodwinked the police.
Officers Davids and Herring, within the
past few days, have been successful in
discovering many secret apartments
which have been fitted up by Chinese

The Building Committee of the Board of

themselves forcibly on the policy of the

OLNEY MAY BE
A CANDIDATE
Anti- Bryan Democrats
Favor Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â
Former Secretary of State Richard Ol
ney may be the candidate of the Eastern
anti-Bryan Democrats in the Democratic
National Convention for the Presidential
nomination in opposition to Bryan.
With Bryan a's a candidate and free bD
ver as a leading issue Eastern Democrats
can see nothing ahead except defeat.
With a new candidate and a new issue
they believe they might succeed.
In the Hay-Pauncefote treaty they see
an opportunity of finding a new issue.
This treaty is being denounced by some
Republicans as a surrender to Great.Brit
ain, and some of the Democrats who are
looking for a new platform and a new can
didate are ready to make opposition to
England, denunciation of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty and the failure of the United
States to take favorable action to the
Boers leading campaign cries.
With this platform, Mr. Olney is looked
upon as being the most available candi
date. His action as Secretary of Stato
during the Venezuelan controversy, v/hen
he and "President Cleveland are declared
to have brought the country near to a
war with Great Britain, is contrasted
with the attitude of Mr. Hay. It io ad
mitted that he might lose some free silver
supporters, but it is contended he would
receive the votes of all gold Democrats
and of many foreign-born voters.

REPUBLICANS TO SELECT
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER
Conference Among the Party Leaders
Will Be Held on Jekyl
. Island Shortly.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â ln a conference
which has been planned to take place on
Jekyl Island among the Republican icad
ers in the near future, it is expected that
President McKlnley's running mate on the
Republican national ticket, which will be
nominated next June in Philadelphia, wiil
be selected. Cornelius N. Bliss is already
on the ground, and prediction Is made that
he will soon be joined by other prominent
Republicans. It is recalled that not quite
a year ago there was a gathering on the
island, which included President McKin
ley. Vice President Hobart, Senator
Hanna, Thomas B. Reed and Mr. Bliss.
It had then just been announced that
President McKinley would be renomlnated
and it was said the meeting on Jekyl
Island was arranged for the purpose of
discussing the Vice Presidential candidate.
Though what wds actually done during
the meeting was kept secret there
was a strong rumor that an attempt was
made to conciliate Mr. Reed with a view
of inducing him to accept the second place
on the ticket. Mr. Reed, however, was not
conciliated.
Mr. Bliss' presence at Jekyl Island
caused a revival last night of the report
that" he will receive the nomination to
succeed Mr. Hobart. His friends have
been urging him as the stronges- available
candidate for the place and ho has not
followed the example of fjllhu Root In
withdrawing his name from consideration.

TWELVE JURORS
SAY AMY MURPHY
KILLED HERSELF
Censure for Horace
Poulin.
IS ACCUSED OF UNMANLINESS
?
WITNESSES REPEAT WHAT HAS
BEEN TOLD ALREADY.
Mother of the Dead Girl Breaks Down
When Her Gaze Falls on the
Betrayer of Her Daugh
ter.
"Do you recognize â¢ that man sitting
there?" asked Coroner Cole of Mrs. Amy
C. Dart yesterday forenoon at the Inquest
into the cause of Amy Murphy's death,
waving his hand as he spoke toward Hor
ace Poulin.
"Yes, sir, I do," replied Mrs. Dart, cast
ing a glance of hatred at the man to
whom her attention had been called. "He
was at my house once to see my daugh
ter."
Mrs. Dart's voice choked as she spoke
the few words in response to Dr." Cole's
question; she trembled, tried to control
herself and then gave way to sobs. Upon
recovering her composure she gave the
Jury the story of her daughter's life that
has already been told.
Mrs. Dart said that one day Amy came
home with a taint of liquor on her breath.
The mother made inquiries concerning it
and Amy said she had been to dinner with
some girl friends and bad drank some
cognac with her coffee.
"Don't you know," asked Coroner Cole,
"that It is unusual for young women to go
to dinner without the company of young
men?"
â¢ "Amy told me she always preferred the
society of girls and never cared much to
go with gentlemen. She told me, however,
that she went to dinner with Foulln some
Sundays."
Interesting testimony was given by Drs.
Brigham and Middleton regarding the
wound in the dead girl's head. Both de
clared it was' made by the bullet found in
the head and that the course of that bullet
was such as to make it entirely probable
that the dead girl had herself tired the
fatal shot. The doctors finally declared
there were powder marks at the edges of
the wound, indicating suicide.
George L. Barber of Shreve's sporting
goods store identified the box found be
side Miss Murphy's body as the one in
which he had put the cartridges that he
sold with the pi3tol. Winifred Murphy,
the 15-year-old sister of the deceased, re
peated the story of her sister telling her
she contemplated suicide.
"She said she wouldn't be afraid to die
if it wasn't for the hereafter," said Wini
fred.
"She was religious, then?" queried Coro
ner Cole.
"No, I don't think so," replied Winifred,
"but she had that fear of what might
come after death."
The child stated that she had gone to
the matinee several times with Poulin and
Amy and once went with them to a res
taurant, where she drank a lemonade.
Amy seemed familiar with the names of
some dissolute women and said she learn
ed them through telephone messages sent
to and from their houses. â¢
Various other witnesses repeated the
stories already told in The Call and noth
ing new came out of the investigation.
Horace Poulin did not testify. Judge
Pierce, his attorney, making objection on
the ground that his client's testimony
might tend to criminate him.
The Jury found that death was caused
by a gunshot wound, and added: "We do
further find that said Amy Murphy came
to her death by her own hands whllÂ« in a
despondent mood: and we do further cen
sure one Horace L. Poulin for his unman
ly conduct toward the deceased girl."
BODY WASHED
UP BY SEA IT
ANGEL ISLAND
Burton Hardiman's
Remains Found.
?
INVESTIGATION BY CORONER
? Â¦
MAY BE A CASE OF SUICIDE OB
ACCIDENTAL DEATH.
The Man Was a Cousin of Florence
Hardiman Miller, a Well Known
literary Woman of
Oakland.
The body of Burton H. Hardiman,
cousin of Mrs. J. K. Miller of Oakland,
better known in the literary world as
Florence Hardlman,Miller, was found yes
terday on the shore at Angel Island by
John Abbott, a laborer. The corpse had
been washed up by the sea and was par
tially burled in the sand. Judging from
its decomposed condition it had been in
the water for some time. How the unfor
tunate man came to his death is yet a
matter to be determined by the Coroner of
this city.
When Abbott discovered the corpse yes
terday he sent word to this city and Dep
uty Coroners Flynn and Smith left in a
launch for the scene. They found that the
remains had been badly disfigured and
bloated, so much bo that identification, ex
cept by clothing, was impossible. The
dead man's outer garments consisted of a
blue overcoat and a dark suit. Both wore
of good quality. In the pockets of the coat
were found a meal ticket issued by the
Cozy Restaurant at 1006 Valencia street of
this city, a card bearing the name of Flor
ence Hardiman Miller, another of J. K.
Miller, manager of the' Club News, 525
Clay street, San Francisco, and one of
Burton, H. Hardiman. There were also
letters which' he had received from his
mother and sister in Oswego, Kans.
Around the waist of the body were
strapped two empty canvas bags.
Hardiman was seen last time several
weeks ago by the proprietors of the res
taurant in which he took his meals. He
was employed at Ewell's X L Dairy in this
city and worked there until the time of
his disappearance. He had been In poor
health. How he came to his death can
only be surmised. He may have leaped
from a ferry-boat or dropped from a
wnarf. The theory of suicide has been
advanced, as the man waa not in eood
physical condition, but this is discredited
by his cousin. The presence of the canvas
bags on his person would indicate that
he met an accidental death while on a
hunting or fishing excursion or, on the
suicide theory, they may have â¢ been

IHE interest displayed over the re
sult of yesterday's race at Oak
land was a reminder of the earlier
days, when sentiment and not
mere love of gold figured more strong
ly in the sport. Advance Guard, owned
by the Canadian firm of Carruthers &
Shields., was considered Invincible in
the three-year-old division by his own
ers. F. W. Brode sports the colors of
the Memphis, Term., firm of J. F.
Schorr & Son, and quite recently had
shown to be a colt possessed of con
siderable form, his Improvement being
remarkable. Under the terms of the
race he was allowed three pounds.
Yellow Tail gained great prominence
in turf circles owing to the fact that
he was sold as a two-year-old by
Burns & Waterhouse to Plunger Hill
for $10,000. Later tho big fellow be-
came the property of Foster & Hack
ett. Possessed of phenomenal speed,
he is one day a turf idol, only to be
crushed a few days later and styled a
"dog." He was Installed favorite in
the betting because of some extraor
dinarily fast trials shown in private.
Before a very large and fashionable
gathering of turfites F. W. Brode, ridden
by Tommy Burns, defeated Advance
Guard and Yellowtail at Oakland track
yesterday in one of the prettiest equine
struggles ever witnessed on the course.
The meeting of this trio of top-sawyers
of the three-year-old brigade had aroused
great Interest and thousands of dollars
were wagered on the result. The climatic
conditions were favomble and the track
in perfect condition. Under the racing
conditions Advance Guard and Yellowtail
each carried 117 pounds, while F. W.
Brode was conceded an allowance of three
pounds, a little joker of shrewd "Johnny".
Schorr. There was a great diversity of
opinion as to the result, the hetting fav
oring Yellowtail, Intensified probably by
the fact that Spencer had the mount.
When the horses were called 3 to 2 was
laid against the big chestnut, with 2
about Advance Guard and Bullman, and
Brode the outsider, the majority of books
laying 12 to 5.
As the horses paraded past the stand,
Tommy Burns, astride the Schorr colt,
received quite an ovation, it being a sort
of welcome on his return to the saddle.
Lined up. Ferglison sent the three away
beautifully aligned at the first breakaway.
And what a clip Spencer, on the favorite,
did set! Reaching the quarter in 24 sec-
too soon. However, the winner is deserv
ing of all the glory he gained, for there is
apparently no such thing in his makeup
as quit. Then. too. he was ridden in
masterly fashion by Burns, who was seen
at his best.
The other events, In which favorites
were successful on four occasions, were
not above mediocrity. Nineteen books
laid odds, and the ring was crowded with
bettors.
Rachel C., at short odds, downed a
small field in the opening event without
effort. Choteau, a 30 to 1 shot, was land
ed second by Ross, four lengths before
The Echo. ; . :
In the five and a half furlong sprint
St. Cuthbert, a 3 to 5 chance, ran away
from his company. Walsh on Montallade,
ing on nearly equal terms. About oppo
site the paddock the favorite was done,
and Burns; in endeavoring to get be
tween the other two, was momentarily
cut off. Drawing the whip, he gave his
mount a couple of cuts, then resumed
hand riding again, and in a terrific drive
Brode snatched victory from Advance
Guard by a nose in 1:39^. Three lengths
away came Yellowtail, a very tired horse.
When the time of year is taken into con
sideration probably no grander race was
ever run by three-year-olds, and though
beaten, neither of the defeated colts was
disgraced. Yellowtail was injudiciously
â¢ridaen by Spencer, there being no occa
sion for making so mucn use of him, and
the more critical were Inclined to. blame
Bullman for his impatience in moving up

of Acting Chief.

The Matter Will Be Formally
Brought Before tfhe Board of
Police Commissioners at
Its Meeting.
>
Formal charges of accepting bribes will
be filed with the Police Commission next
Tuesday night by acting Chief of Police
Biggy against E. C. Robinson. William E.
Rice and Nell Riordan, the police officers
who are accused of having released ar
rested Chinamen upon the payment of
money.
Against Robert Morton, the fourth mem
ber of Sergeant Ellis' squad, no charges
have been made, and the acting Chief
says that Morton is not in any way mixed
up in the alleged bribe-taking scandal.
Six Chinese have made affidavits, type
written copies of which are now in the
hands of acting Chief Biggy, that the ac
cused officers demanded and received
money for the release of men they had
arrested. Robinson was positively identi
fied by four of the Chinese, Riordan by
two and Rice by two when the officers
were brought with a dozen others frcm
Chinatown before the Mongolians who
claimed they had been made the victims
of bluecoat cupidity. Nearly all of these
Chinese speak good English. One of them,
Lun Yuey, has a merchandise store at
Sebastopol; Gee Won, an extremely in
telligent Chinese, works for "the railroad
company betwetn here and Sacramento;
Chang Poo cooks for Mrs. Howard, at 12W
Alice street. Oakland; two others work
for Alaskan canneries.
The total amount known to have been
given up by Chinese is $24. Of this J9 was
yielded, according to the Chinese, last
Friday afternoon, and the other $15 vvas
paid over by another lot of victims Sun
day morning. V
According to the story of Gee "Won,
himself and four other Chinamen were
arrested in Ross alley Friday by Officers
Riordan and Robinson, and they at once
bartered for their release. The price was
fixed at $3 and each paid that amount
witn the exception of Henry Lem, who
had no money. One of the three who had
produced went to Neg Dock at 20 Ross
alley and got $3 with which to release
Henry Lem. who. the Chinese allege, was
still in the clutches of the officers at the
house where the arrest had been made.
In the meantime Officers Collins and Ly
ons came along, it is stated, and Riordan
and Robinson released Henry Lem.
Officers Rice and Robinson were the
arresting officers in the St. Louis alley
affair, so the Chinamen say. The three
men who it is alleged were arrested here
say they were taken into a doorway at
816^ Jackson street and that there they
slipped $15 into Rice's pocket for the re
lease of the three.
Sergeant Duke Is still in San Jose after
the affidavit of a Chi/iaman from whom
one of the three last mentioned China
men says he borrowed $6 50 to help make
up the purse of $15.
The accused officers deny emphatically
the charges made against them and say
they feel certain that the commission will
exonerate them. Officers Rice and Robin
son yesterday made detailed statements
to the acting Chief. They said they were
led down Jackson street to near Dupont
by three Chinese, who said there was a
nlghbinder in a house there. When they
got to the place the Chinese tried to hold
back. One of the officers said "Are they
trying to job us?" They held the Chinese
and went through the house, finding
nothing. They made no arrests at all.
Policemen Michael Hurley, O. C. Phil
lips and William Coleman have taken the
places of the suspended men.

sisting of a dispatch from Los Angeies to
the effect that the Russian colonists are
in great distress and a movement is on
foot in the boomers" center to .send tho
sufferers dried fruit, together with cloth
ing and provisions. The dispatch states
that the Russians are on the verge of
starvation and that they were dumped
upon the bleak prairies last winter an.l
spring without a dollar. They failed to
find ths remunerative work that had been,
promised them, and in consequence wer<j
unable to purchase oxen and fannies
tools. Five hundred of the number wera
at work for four months, and their earn
ings supplied potatoes and other vegeta
bles, and some bought a horse or two. but
if it had not been for the kindness of the
Quakers these poor people would have
fared worse. In some villages there U no
food but cornmeal and flour, and but lit-
Ue of them. Add to this the fact that
scurvy has attacked the unfortunates, and
the proposition that they would be a most
undesirable addition to the population 13
self-evident.
The following is a copy of the letter sent
by Captain Schell.'
Hon. T. V. Powderly. Commissioner General-
Sir: I beg to call your attention to Inclosed
clipping from The Call of to-day's issue. There
Is a reasonable probability that these pÂ«opls
will be brought Into the State of California, as
amenta have been In the State seeking lands on
which to colonize them, and rumor has it tliat
lands have been secured In the southern part
of the State for them. It Is said that thesÂ«
people are In extreme destitution: that they arÂ»
afflicted with scurvy and other diseases, sequels
of poor nourishment and exposure: that they
are religious monomaniacs and believe that
their afflictions come from God for the better
ment of their souls and to fit them for their
future life, which belief renders them Incom
petent In a degree to shake off the poverty and
distress that has afflicted them for many gener
ations past. It is also said that they come from
the northern or cold portion of Russia. If this
Is true, they are quite unfitted for gaining a
livelihood in the semi-tropical climate of South
ern California.
It would seem that some investigation of thÂ»
matter should be made before these peopla
start for this country, their nnmberm being
large and their presence* undesirable. Respect
fully, H. H. SCHELL,
Acting Commissioner.

complaint, openly claimed Jenkins pulled

The suspension of Conley, the colored

of turf scandal. After the first race yes

to cease laying odds by the judges. On
Wednesday, when Red Pirate, ridden by
Conley, was beaten, Rose took what is
termed a "hard fall" out of the horse,
