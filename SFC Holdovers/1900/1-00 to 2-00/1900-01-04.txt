BOER SYMPATHIZERS
AND ALLEGED TREASON
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 3.â A citizens'
committee was formed here 1 to-day to
ascertain the identity of all Boer sym
pathizers identified with the Transvaal
assistance movement and institute prose
cutions for treason, also arranging a boy
cott. The movement, which has excited
great Indignation, Is chiefly among Ger

RUSSIA'S CZAR
WILL NOT INTERFERE
LONDON, Jan. 3.â The Vienna corre
spondent of the Standard says: Emperor
Nicholas has assured the British Embas
sador at St. Petersburg (Sir C. S. Scott)
that Great Britain need not fear interven
tion or any sort of difficulty from Rus
sia In the South African complications.
This may fairly be interpreted as an as
surance including an indirect promise that
France will abstain from creating difficul
ties for England..
ROUGH VOYAGE OF
THE STEAMER THYRA
Beset by Heavy Seas on Her Trip
From Portland to San
Itfego.
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 3.â Tha California and
Oriental steamship Thyra, Captain J. O.
Edwardsen. arrived this forenoon from
Portland, having on board about 3SOO tons
of flour. She left Portland on tha mom
ing of December 27. and after being bar
bound at the mouth of the Columbia
River for twenty-four hours she got away,
running into the storm which has been
off the coast for the past week and more.
The storm did not leave her until she
rounded Point Loma Into the bay this
forenoon, and even then the rain con
tinued, though with some abation. â¢ Â¦
The captain reports that the seas were
heavy all the way down the coa3tÂ» and
that progress was necessarily slow. Ho
expected to make San Diego on Monday,
but the storm kept him back. There was
no trouble and the vessel made headway
all the time, but the wind was from tha
southeast and it was slow work headinz
into it.
The Thyra will begin loading: to-morrow
morning. She will take about 1000 tons
of wire and nails and 3400 to 3600 bales of
cotton, besides about 100 tons of general
merchandise that may bo offered. She
will take out one of the most valuable
cargoes yet taken from th! 3 port by tha
new transpacific steamer line. The steam
er Volumnia. now twenty-eight days out
of Valparaiso, is due on Sunday or Mon
day, and the Oriental steamer Lady Joy
sie is expected along about the 12th.
STEAMER BORGHESE
IS A TOTAL WRECK
LONDON, Jan. 4.â A dispatch from Bris

last Friday during a "hurricane. Twenty
two of the crew were drowned. The sur
vivors, nine In number, have juat arrived
at Bristol.
Chief was hand in glove with the.Pin
kertons â so much so,. indeed, that they
did not consider it necessary to have
an agency here. Finally, with the rush
of racetrack business, they were com
pelled to put in a local force, and since
then Lees has not been working with
them. No rupture is supposed to have
occurred, but all is fair in love and de
tective work, and the San Francisco
veteran is on the trail of the golden
goose. With his private rogues' gal
lery, which the city thought its very.
own, he should be able to cover the
detective business of the coast. That
he will leave no stone unturned to do so>
goes without saying.
Meanwhile the San Francisco Police
Department will have to go without a
rogues' gallery.
GENERAL H. SHOEMAN, Commanding the Boer Forces
Opposing General French in the Colesberg District,
Cape Colony.
General French's victory was a little pre
r mature. Later reports show that his puc
et-ss was not complete, as at first
thought. The British have not been able
to occupy Coie?bÂ«rg. During the
r.lpht the Boers were reinforced and re
occuple-1 the position out of which they
had been maneuvered. They then opened
fire upon the British cavalry with tneir
guns, which were supposed to have been
disabled. Th*y seem to be in considerable
Ftrensrth and may prove too hard a nut
for French's little force to crack. It !s
f-ignlficant that in General French's re
port, as Issued by the War Office, he
rays he thinks hp could drive the Boers
off if he had reinforcements.
The Borrs are reported to be hemmed in
by British guns which command Norvals
Point bridge and the road bridge north of
Colesberg. but to the south and east a
way of retreat is open. It would be very
remarkable if French's small column
were able to hem In their active oppo
nents. As to reinforcements, it is very
doubtful if these can be spared from any
quarter. Just now every man is wanted
Jn Natal. General French haa lost a train
laden with supplies, which was set In
motion, it is reported, by treachery. The
Boers, frustrated by a heavy fire, made
en attempt to- rescue a train and recover
the Bupplies. Ehowing that they are in
force not far away.
The critical iltuatlon in Natal Is unal
tered, but it is impossible that It can re
rr.afn so much longer. Everything points
to the fact that General Joubert has
sought to envelop the British wings by
a croscent-shaped formation, the two
horns being at Springfield, on the Little
Tugela, on the west and at Hlangwane
Mountain or perhaps even Weenen on tho
cast. A strong position on the southeast
of 'Colcr.so would seem to be 'the best
'point to be attacked. If General Buller
once gains the crest of Mount Inhwane.
his big guns will command both Colenso
and the enemy's entrenchments along the
river. The problem on the Tugela River
â¢will probably be solved by a series of en
gagements on the result of which will
depend the British hope of breaking down
the opposition' and rr-lieving Ladysmith.
Â¦ General Buller's call for more stretcher
hearers and the movement of foreign at
taches point to th<Â» Imminence of fighting.
The Fourteenth Hussars and Twentieth
Field Battery, which sailed from Cape
town for Durban a few days ago. should
have arrived, completing General War
ren's force. By the end of this week an
advance may be expected. It may be
pointed out that the very fact of the
IJoers holding three strong detached posi
tions facing General Buller, viz.: On the
right, on Inhlawe Mountain, on the south
bank of Tugela with rntrenchments, fac
ing Colenso, and on left with an Orange
Free State commando at Springfield, may
prove an advantage to the British. The
Hoer Jine Is so extended that a rapid* at
tack on one of these positions may suc
ceed before reinforcements could arrive.
The total Boer force is probably 20,000 to
2j,o<>o. with fifty or sixty guns. Buller's
.reinforced strength we now know, thank 3
to the censor who has allowed some facts
to come through, amounts to about 22,000
infantry. 2500 mounted men, half regukor
and half irregular mounted Infantry, fifty

friction. One thing is certain, the matter
will not be settled hurriedly, though it
is impossible for the Cabinet Minister to
forecast the date when Mr. Choate will

ALDERMEN OBJECT TO
"PEACE WITH HONOR"
NEW YORK, Jan. 3.â A special dispatch
from St. John. N. 8., to the Commercial
Advertiser says:
On New Year's day Mayor Sears sent
the following message to the Canadian
High Commissioner in London: "May
New Year's blessings rest upon her
Majesty, bringing peace with honor."
Tho Board of Aldermen is now . after
his scalp.. At a meeting of the Board of
Public Works yesterday. Aldermen Mil

Mayor's right" to speak for the people.
As the Mayor refused to call a special
meeting of the Council to discuss the mat
ter to-day, a meeting. was called by. eight
Aldermen and a hot time is expected.' The
Board "of Public Works, before adjourn
ment, adopted^ the following resolution:
Whereas, The expression "Peace, with honor"
in diplomatic language, ' Indicates that a nation
which has Buffered reverses may, without loss
of dignity, accept. terms of an opponent; and,
.whereas; the opinion of this community la op
posed to peace upon any other terms than the
unconditional surrender of the national enemy.'
Resolved, That the board regret* that in a
semi-official manner the views of the people of
I though the Boers removed their laager
! out of range of our guns, they still oc
cupy a strong position around Colesberg
in big force. General French and his
staff and Colonel Porter's command
, stayed out last night. Everything is quiet
i to-day.
An extraordinary occurrence took place
last night. A number of trucks, loaded
with foodstuffs, got loose and ran away
from our lines down the Colesberg decliv
ity toward the Boers at great-speed. Far
ther 1 down there was a broken culvert
commanded by Boer guns. Three trucks
crossed the culvert and remained on tho
line, marvelous to pay. The others fell
over, while some remained on this side.
The engine-driver of the trafn attempted
to rescue it. but was shelled by the Boers
and obliged to retreat. A train was then
sent to rescue the goods in the wrecked
train, escorted by a cavalry company of
Suffolks. but when it reached Plewnans
Siding it was subjected to a terrific shell
fire from a Hotchkiss and a big gun and
also rifle fire. The train and its escort
had to hurry off. An attempt will prob
ably be made to-night to destroy the
goods. We command Norvals Pont.

PUZZLING AFTERMATH
OF THE FLOUR SEIZURES
LONDON, Jan. 3.â The United States
Embassador, Joseph H. Choate. visited
the British Premlor, Lord Salisbury, at
the Foreign Office this evening, for the
purpose of making the first official rep
resentation on the subject of the Delagoa
Bay flour seizure. Mr. Choate received
no definite reply, as the Premier In
formed him that the British Government
had not arrived at any decision as to
whether or not food stuffs were contra
band of war. but Lord Salisbury assured
Mr. Choate the commercial rights of the
United States would be equitably con
sidered and that a decision in this Im
portant matter would be reached as soon
as possible. The Interview was brief.
It 1b learned that Lord Salisbury "has
not only eot the Attorney. General, Sir
Richard Webster, working hard on the
question of the Delagoa Bay seizures but
that he is consulting with the ablest
lawyers- In Great Britain. To quote a
high official: "England is between
Scylla and Charybdls. If we declare food
stuffs contraband we put ourselves in a
most awkward position should we be a
neutral power in some future war. "We

CAPTAIN JOHN SEYMOUR of the City Prison.
thought to such an institution as a
rogues' gallery, they certainly labored
under the impression that a fully
equipped Police Department was about
to be turned over to them. Even after
the retirement of Lees they had no
fear that they would be unable to find
in Esola a competent successor.
Whether or not that is so remains to be
seen, but it is certain that the choice
of the new Commissioners will be
badly handicapped in going into office
â the business of which is to prevent
and detect crime â without the aid of a
rogues' gallery. How the Chief to be
appointed will get around this difficulty
is a conundrum hard to solve.
Lees' descent upon and capture of the
rogues' gallery is based upon his claim
that he owns it from cover to cover,
with every photo and criminal record in
it There is no question that he start
ed it, years and years ago, when it was
not dreamed that San Francisco would
grow to its present importance upon
the map of the world. At that time â
thirty or forty years ago â no financial
provision was made for the collection of
photographs of criminals, no books
were provided for criminal records. He
began on his own account to gather
and index and classify the "mugs" of
notorious crooks that came this way,
and he has continued it ever since, with
out, he claims, a cent's worth of assist
ance from the city.
The collection is now an enormous
one.. It contains the photographs, an
tecedents, criminal records and close
descriptions of nearly every crook in
the country, white, black and yellow.
The ugly "mugs" of 14.744 whites and
blacks, men and women, glower from
the pages of the gallery, and in black
and white their records are under the
thumb of the possessor. In addition
the faces of 2570 Chinese and Japanese
murderers and thieves are inclosed be
tween its covers. And Chief Lees has
them all, and the city's big black iron
cupboard is bare.
Whether or not this claim of the ex-
Chief will hold in law is a question
that depends entirely upon the incoming
Police Commissioners. They will un
doubtedly make claim that the ex-
Chief had no right to re
move the gallery. Those who
know the white-haired veteran de
tective may be sure that he will stub
bornly contest any such claim and yiill
make as bitter a fight in the court as
he knows how â and he can go a little
at that, as the history of the department
will show.
Pending the probability of any such
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â There is reason to be
lieve that the Transvaal Government has but recently requested this Government to use its
good offices to bring an end to its war with Great Britain. The proposition, I understand,
came through the American Consul at Pretoria. No answer has been given by the State De
partment, and unless Great Britain intimates that she is desirous of the President exercising
his good offices there is no, reason to believe that_rjejyjlj^cqmp|y^wjth : jhe Boer request. It is
~to be expected that a reply will be made acknowledging the receipt^ of the Consul's representa
tion, which he will transmit to State Secretary Reitz, but this, probably, is as far as the Govern
ment will care to go at this time.
It can be stated on authority that there is no intention on the part of the administration
to depart from its policy of non-interference unless requests for mediation are received simul
taneously from Great Britain and the Transvaal. Just before the outbreak of hostilities the
Boer Government appealed to the President to use his influence with Great Britain to avert war,
but the President declined to interfere, and nothing has occurred to change his determination.
In certain quarters there is a disposition to urge American mediation on the ground that
under the agreement of The Hague conference the United States could extend its mediation to
Great Britain without offending that power. In answer to this suggestion it is said, first, that
the United States has not yet become a party to the convention, becaase it has not yet been
ratified by the Senate; and, second, the American delegates representing the United States at
the conference guarded the historic position of the United States by the declaration that nothing
contained in the convention should be so construed as to require this * Government to depart
from its policy of non-interfering with foreign questions.
It is stated that the movements initiated by Europeans to obtain the mediation of this
Government will be fruitless of results, unless, as stated, they first induce Great Britain to in
timate to this Government her willingness to accept the exercise of the powers' good offices.

but the rogues' gallery will be. When
he left he took it with him. and in the
recesses of the big black iron case in
the "upper office," where it once was
stored, are only aching voids. Lees
descended on the office Tuesday night,
opened the case and took the gallery
with him. He claims it as his own per
sonal property, to do with as he will,
and he does not will that it shall be of
benefit to the department from which
his judgment told him to resign to save
dismissal at the hands of the new Com

This new,s will come undoubtedly as
a painful surprise to the newly appoint

they probably never gave a moment of

Buller's Call for More Stretcher-

LONDON, Jan. 4.â A rer>ort was cur
rent in London yesterday that the
Boers had attacked Molteno, and
that a battle was raging. This mys
tified those who have been follow
ing closely the movements of the differ
ent columns. It must be remembered that
General Gatacre, soon after his repulse
at Etormbergr. evacuated Molteno and re
tired to Sterkstoom, bis present head
quarters.
Inquiry at the 'War Office elicited the
reply that nothing had been received con
firmatory of the report, although several
telegrams had been received from General
Gatacre'e camp of a new advance to Mol
teno. It Is possible that simultaneously
with General French's move on Colesberg
General Gatacre pushed forward a small
force to "Molteno to feel the way for an
advance on Stromberg, and that the Boers
had met this movement by a prompt at
tack. Molteno Is sunk in a hollow among
the. hills and It not an easy place to hold.
Gatacre, supposing that he is there, will
cither have to abandon it again or ad

FRIENDS OF HANNA
PLANNED IN VAIN
Senator Positively Refuses to Become
Chairman of the Republican
Convention.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, January 3.â Sena
tor Hanna declared to-day that although
he had been urged to Btand for the per
manent chairmanship of the next Repub
lican National Convention he would not
do bo.
"There are other men," he said, "who
are more ambitious than I and who value
that honor more than I do. I will give
way to them."
He also declared that he would not be
one of the delegates at large from Ohio.
"I greatly desire that General Dick
shall have an uncontested place In the
Ohio delegation at large," he explained,
"and I am glad to step out in his favor.
If I was to be considered as one of the
delegates at large, precedent giving the
place to me as a Senator, there would be
a contest between General Grosvenor and
General Dick. I being out of it, there will
be room for both of them, as there shouli
be. and friction will be avoided."
It is evident from the foregoing that the
plan to make Senator Hanna a delegate
at large and permanent chairman of the
Republican National Convention was
formed without his consent.
Senator and Mrs. Hanna and Miss Ruth
Hanna departed this afternoon for Wash
ington, where they will again occupy the
Hobart residence.
IMPORTANT DECISIONS
OF HAWAIIAN COURTS
â¢WASHINGTON, Jan. B.â The Secretary
of State has sent to the House several let
ters of Harold Z. Sewall, the United
States Special Agent at Hawaii, giving
recent decisions of the Hawaiian courts,
showing the condition now existing.
Mr. Sewall Bays the decisions in Pea
cock & Co. and Lovejoy & Co. against
Hawaii hold that the Hawaiian Govern
ment may collect the customs duties pre
scribed by Its laws, notwithstanding the
provision of the constitution of the United
States. In another, Hawaii vs. Edwards,
It Is held that felons may be prosecuted
now as prior to the annexation of Hawaii
to the United States.
Mr. Sewall says the importance of the
decisions has attracted much attention to
them and subjected them to much criti
cism, especially from members of the bar.
He adds that he is confidentially advised
that an effort will be made, by a ship
ment from Hawaii of American manufac
tures which have paid the Hawaiian duty,
to bring the point of the Peacock case
before the Supreme Court of the United
States.
Hawaiian Bill Discussed.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â The Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations to
day considered a number of pending ques
tions. The bill by Senator Cullom provid
ing a territorial government for Hawaii
was discussed, but, the sub-committee
which has the subject under considera
tion not being ready to report. It was
announced that another meeting would
be held soon, when the bill would be re
ported to the full committee. There was
some talk about ,the French reciprocity
treaty, and it was decided to hear John
A. Kasson, who conducted the negotia
tions, and members of the Finance Com
mittee at the regular meeting next
"Wednesday.

GOVERNMENT FOR
PUERTO RICANS
Text of Senator Fora-
Measure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â Senator For
aker to-day introduced a bill providing a
form of government for the island of
Puerto Rico. The bill provides for the
continuance of the laws and municipal
ordinances now in force on the Island
until the Legislature provided for shall
supplant them. The President is em
powered to appoint a Governor, a Supreme
Court, seven heads of departments to
have charge of the various Interests of
the government and flve native citizens,
who, together with the Governor and
heads' of departments, are to constitute
the upper branch of the insular' Legis
lature.
A lower house of sixty-five members to
be elected by citizens of the islands is also
provided for, and all inhabitants of the
island are made citizens of the United
States. The citizens are to elect a dele
gate to Congress, who is to have a seat
but no vote. The island is to be divided
into flve districts for judicial and . legis
lative purposes* and each district is to
have a local court to consist of such a
number of Judges as the Legislature may
provide for. .
The constitution and laws of the United
States are extended to the island so far
as the latter are locally applicable.
The export duties are prohibited and
free trade is provided for between the
island and the United States proper. Ar
ticles imported into Puerto Rico from
other countries than the United States
are to pay the same duties as those im
posed in the ports of this country. The
money thus . collected is to go into the
Island treasury, but money realized from
the internal revenue collections Is to bo
covered into the national treasury of the
United States.
A committee of five members, .two of
whom are to be natives, is provided for
to revise the system of laws and of
Judicial procedure on the island. For 'the
present no franchises are to be provided
except upon the approval both of the
Governor of the island and the President
of the United States.
In speaking of the bill Senator Foraker
said It did not create a Territory out of
the Island nor undertake to give the Island
a Territorial form of government In the
ordinary understanding of that phrase,
adding that it merely provided a simple
form of government which It was believed
would answer the purpose until a more
matured form could be devised. The Sen
ator said the blh was Intended only for
a basis for the committee on Puerto Rico
to act upon.
GAGE TO GIVE INFORMATION.
House Likely to Pass the Resolution
of Sulzer.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8. - Chairman
Payne and some of hi 3 associates of the
Ways and Means Committee had an In
formal talk after the adjournment of the
House to-day regarding the Sulzer resolu
tions calling on the Secretary of the
Treasury for Information which had been
referred to the committee. A meeting of
the committee will be held to-morrow and
a pretty thorough understanding was ar
rived at to-day that at to-morrow's meet
ing the resolution would be considered
and probably reported at once to the
House. Some changes are likely to be
made in the resolution by the omission of
the two banks specifically named,' thus
making the Inquiry relate generally to
all banks. It is also understood that per
sonal references are likely to be avoided
in the amended resolutions. In the form
thus reported back to the House it Is
expected the resolutions will pass with
out objection, and any debate on the
ouestlon involved will be deferred, until
the Secretary of the Treasury has an op
portunity to comply with the request for
information.

AMENDMENTS TO
FINANCIAL BILL
Changes Made by Sen
ate Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.-The Republi
can members of the Senate Finance
Committee authorized Senator Aldrich to
present the amendments to the financial
bill, which he offered in the Senate to
day. The most important relates to the
greenbacks and Is as follows:
After the word "authority" on line 5, page 12,
strike out the remainder of the section and in
sert:
; "And the gold coin received from the sale of
said bonds 6hall first be covered Into the gen
eral fund of the treasury and then exchanged
in the manner hereinbefore provided for an
equal amount of the notes redeemed and held
for exchange, and the United States notes ex
changed In accordance wlfh the provisions of
this section shall, when covered Into the treas
ury, be reissued as now provided by law, and
the gold coin in the reserve fund together with
the redeemed notes held for use as provided in
this section shall at no time exceed the maxi
mum wm of $150,000,000."
All of section 6 is eliminated and the
following new section substituted:
Section 6. That the Secretary of the Treasury
is hereby authorized to receive at the treasury
any of the obtaining bonds of the United States
bearing Interest at 5 per cent per annum, pay
able February 1, 1904, and any bonds of the
United States bearing Interest at the rate of 4
per cent per annum, payable July 1. 1907, and
nny bonds of the United States bearing interest
at 2 per cent per annum, payable August 1,
1908. and to Issue In exchange therefor an equal
amount of coupon registered bonds of the
United States, in. such form as he may pre
scribe. In denominations of $50, or any multiple
thereof, bearing interest at the rate of 2 per
cent per annum, payable quarterly, such bonds
to be payable at the pleasure of the United
States after thirty years from the date of their
issue, and said bonds to be payable, principal
and Interest, In gold coin of the present stand
ard value, and to be exempt from the payment
of all taxes or duties of th* United States as
well as from taxation in any form by or under
State, municipal or local authority; provided
that such outstanding bonds may be received in
exchange at a valuation not greater than their
present worth, to yield an income of 2V4 per
cent per annum; and In consideration of the re
duction of the Interest effected, the Secretary
of the Treasury is authorized to pay to the
holders of outstanding bonds surrendered for ex
change, out of any money In the treasury not
otherwise appropriated, a sum not greater than
the difference between their present worth, com
puted as aforesaid, and their par value, and the
payments to be made hereunder shall be held
to be payments on account of the sinking fund
created by section 3694 of the Revised Statutes;
and provided, further, that the 2 per cent bonds
to be Issued under the provisions of this act
shall be Issued at not less than par, and they
shall be numbered consecutively In the order
of their Issue and when payment Is made the
last numbers shall be followed until all the
bonds are paid, and whenever any of the out
standing bonds are called for payment Interest
thereon shall cease three months after such
call.
Another amendment is to tha second
section of the bill, where It provides
for maintaining the gold reserve. The
bill, as reported, made it the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury to maintain
the gold reserve at $100,000,000 by the sale
of bonds. The amendment provides that
when the reserve falls below that amount
it shall be his duty to restore it to the
maximum of $150,000,000.
It is stated by members of the commit
tee that the amendments are for the pur
pose of making more clear the intention
of the bill and leave no question as- to
the construction of the law when en
acted.
Senator Chandler of New Hampshire
to-day offered an amendment to the
financial bill adding two sections as fol
lows:
Section 9. That In accordance with the act
of November 1, 1593. which repeals a part ot
the act of July 14. IS9O, It Is hereby re
affirmed and declared to be the existing policy
of the United States to continue the use of
both gold and sliver as standard money and to
coin both gold and silver into money of equal
intrinsic and interchangeable value; such equal
ity to be secured through International agree
ment or by such safeguards of legislation as
will Insure the maintenance of the parity In
the value of the coins of the two metals and
the equal power of every dollar at all times
in the markets and in the payments of debts,
and it is declared that the efforts of the Gov
ernment should be steadily directed to the es
tablishment of some safe system of bimetallism
as will maintain at all times the equal power
of every dollar coined or Issued by the United
States In the markets and the payment of
debts.
Section 10. That the provisions of the act of
March 3, 1597, authorizing the President to ap
point commissioners to any International con
ference called by the United States or any
other country with a view to securing by Inter
national agreement a fixity or relative value
between gold and silver as money by means
of a common ratio between these metals, with
free mlntace at such ratio, be and the same
are hereby re-enacted and continued In force.
SENATORS INSIST
Oil INFORMATION
Philippine Question Is
Called Up.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.-The Senate
evinced a disposition to-day to take up
the work of the session In earnest, and,
while the sitting was of only a little more
than an hour's duration, a large number
of important bills were introduced and a
definite foundation lajd for proceeding
with the financial bill by fixing the hour
for beginning debate on this measure for
2 o'clock to-morrow. The most notable
event of the day was a protest entered by
Hoar of Massachusetts to the summary
disposition of resolutions asking for in
formation about the conduct of the Phil
ippine war. He indicated a purpose to
demand consideration for such measures,
even at the expense of the financial bill.
The 10th inst. was named as the date for
eulogies in memory of the late Vico
President Hobart.
When the Senate resumed its sittings
Allen presented a resolution calling upon
the Secretary of the Treasury for all let
ters passing between the Treasury De
partment and the National City Bank
and the Hanover National Bank o< Isew
York, and also the agreements made ber
tween the Treasury Department and
those banks concerning the deposit of
funds, etc.
Aldrich objected to present considera
tion and the resolution went over until
to-morrow: A like disposition was made
of a resolution offered by Pettigrew
calling upon the Secretary of War for in
formation as to whether General Torres
of the Philippine army came under a flag
of truce as a representative of Aguinaldo
to General Otis after the beginning or
hostilities laat February, making an ex
planation of the outbreak and suggesting
means of terminating the troubles. The
resolution was objected to by feyeml
Senators. Pettigrew's resolution in lull
was as follows: ;
Resolved. That the Secretary of War. be. -.and
he is hereby, directed to inform the Senate
whether General Torres, one of the offleera of
the Philippine army, came to General Otis with
a flag of truce on February 5. 1899. the day
after th* fighting commenced between our
forces and those of Aguinaldo, and stated to
General Otis that Aguinaldo declared that fight
ing had begun accidentally and was not author
ized by Aguinaldo. and that Aguinaldo wished
to have it stopped, and that, to bring about a
conclusion of hostilities, he proposed the estab
lishment of a neutral zone between the two
armies of a width that would be agreeable to
General Otis, so that during the peace negotia
tions there might be no further. danger of 'Con
flict between the two armies; and whether Gen
eral Otis replied that, fighting having once be
gun, must co on to the grim end; also, was
General Otis directed by the Secretary of "War
to make such answer, and did General Otis tele
graph the Secretary of War on February 9 aa
follows: '"'â¢
"Aguinaldo now applies for a cessation of
hostilities and conferences. I have, declined to
answer." . . - "}*â¢
And did General Otis afterward reply that he
was directed by the Secretary of War. and what
answer. If any. did he or the Secretary of war
make to the application to cease fighting.
Aldrich. chairman of the Finance Com
mittee, gave notice of his Intention", to call
up the financial bill to-morrow immediate
ly after the disposal of the routine morn-
Ing business, provided there was no objec
tion. The notice brought Hoar to his
feet with an objection which was based
upon the fact that several Senators had
objected to the consideration of Petti
grew's Philippine resolution.
"If" said Hoar, "there is to be an
absolute suppression of all requests for in
formation concerning the war with the
Filipinos, I shall object to the taking up
of other matters during the morning
hour when such resolutions are pending."
He called attention to the fact that fdu'r
Senators had risen upon the presentation
of the Pettigrew resolution to object to
consideration. This was done in the face
of the fact that it was the uniform cus
tom of the Senate to allow resolutions of
inquiry to go through without obstruction.
He wanted to know if this policy was to
be continued.
The statement brought Aldrich, Chand
ler and Hawley to their feet. Aldrich dis
claimed any intention of suppressing in
formation concerning military affairs.
Hawley and Chandler both explained that
the suggestions concerning the Pettigrew
resolution had only covered the point of
postponement until to-morrow, which,
they asserted, was not out of the ordi
nary. With a few further words on the
part of Mr. Hoar the incident was closed.

CONGRESS RESUMES ITS LABORS.
GAGE ASKED FOR
AN EXPLANATION
House Flurry Over Pub
lic Funds Deposits.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â The House was
in session only fifteen minutes to-day, and
during that time had a little flurry over
an attempt by Sulzer of New York to se
cure consideration for a resolution ask
ing information concerning the relations
of the Treasury Department with the Na
tional City Bank of New York. The reso
lution was referred to the Committee on
Ways and Means.
There were premonitions of a Btorm
when the House assembled. Galnes (Dem.)
of Tennessee obtained precedence over
Sulzer by rising to a question of personal
privilege. He had read a publication al
leging that he had stated that in voting
for the Tayler resolution to investigate
the case of Brlgham H. Roberts he had
been actuated by motives of self-preser
vation. He denounced the publication as
false and without foundation.
Sulzer was then recognized and offered
his resolution, which was read at the
clerk's desk, as follows:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be, -and he hereby Is. directed to furnish the
House of Representatives as soon as possible
with the followlne information:
1. All letters, agreements, papers or docu
ments between the Treasury Department of the
United States and any person connected there
with and the National City Bank and the Han
over National Bank of the city of New York,
r* any person acting for them or either of
them, since the 4th day of March, 1897, , relating
to the deposition of public funds or revenues
in nald bank or banks, or any other relations
or business transactions now existing or had be
tween the Government and the said banks, or
either ot them.
2. The amount of public 'money, bonds or
revenue deposited with said banks, or either of
them, by the Government, for what length of
time, and the reasons therefor, and whether the
paid banks, or either of them, have paid the
Government any Interest on the said deposits,
and. If so, how much, and all other facts con
cerning . the came or In any way relating
thereto. Â¦_
The Speaker immediately ruled that the
resolution under the rules must go first
to a committee and was not privileged.
"If the committee does not report it
back within one week, does it become
privileged?" asked Sulzer.
"It does," responded the Speaker.
'-'I now ask unanimous consent for the
consideration of the resolution," said Sul
zer. Â¦ f
"The resolution should be first consid
ered by a committee," said Payne, floor
leader. for the majority. "I object/
The resolution was then referred to the
Committee on Banking and Currency. â¢
That ended the little flurry, and at 12:15
p. m., upon Payne's motion, the House
adjourned until to-morrow.
The Sulzer resolution relative to the
Treasury Department probably will be re
ported back from the Ways and Means
Committee to the House, so amended as
to omit specific reference to the two banks,
and to refer generally to all banks. The
committee will meet prior to the session
of the House to-morrow to adopt this
course.
FRUIT SHIPPED EAST
UNDER A PROTEST
Growers Take This Course to Avoid
Loss t)u Its Rotting in
the Cars.
IX)S AXGEL-E3, Jan. 3.â Although the
:!trus fruit shippers have not abandoned
their fight- agarnst the two railroad com
parers with * ttt oror.ee to- the routing of
hhlprrf'sts Cast.- in ordÂ»r to prevent the
absolute loss of their fruit which' has al
ready been loaded on carp, they decided
Â¦ to-day to.f orward the shipments to the
Ktistcrn markets practically on the road
stated by the railroad.
This teas done only under protest, and
try taking. tbis action the shippers assert
that, they liavu not departed Irom the
stand thty u>ok when the order repulat
. Ing routing went -Into effect January 1.
Their -action Is by no means a Furren
der to the companies, but is taken after
careful consideration of the several
courses left open to them.
Tlie fact that the shipments were made
under protest was noted on the bills of
lading, and the railroad companies were
formally notified in writing in various
places that by sending . the loaded cars
East the shippers did not admit the right
of the companies to demand absolute con
trol of the routings, but that the ship
ments were made in order to save the
fruit which had been loaded and in order
also to prevent an unwarranted advance
in price in the several Eastern markets,
such an advance under the circumstances
not being desired.
To-night all the cars through this part
of the State, which have been loaded
since January 1, were forwarded East, or
as many of them as could be sent out
last, night were forwarded.

WILL SELECT
A CANAL ROUTE
Panama Commissioners
Ready to Sail.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 3.â The commission
appointed by President McKinley under
an act of Congress to determine the most
feasible and practicable route for a canal
across the isthmus of Panama will sail on
Saturday for the scene of its labors by a
steamer of the Atlas line. The members
of the commission are: Rear Admiral
Walker, U. S. N. (retired), chairman; Pro
fessor Emery R. Johnson of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania; Professor W. H.
Burr of Columbia University; George S.
Morrison, civil engineer. New York; ex-
United States Senator Pasco of Florida;
Alfred Noble, civil engineer, Chicago;
General Peter Haines. U. S. A.; Professor
L,. M. Haupt, University of Pennsylvania;
General O. H. Ernst. U. S. A.
A member of the commission said to
day: "The duty of the commission is not
to decide between the claims of the Pan
ama canal and the Nicaragua canalâ
though it may come to thatâ but to deter
mine the most feasible and practicable
route, wherever that may be. Whether
there is any route preferable to either of
those which has become so well known we
shall do our utmost to discover.
"The commission Is absolutely without
bias. It is uncommittea, open-minded,
judicial.
"We shall sail directly to Greytown.
whence we shall proceed to make a full
examination of the Nicaragua canal route.
Upon reaching the Pacific side we shall
go down the coast to Panama and follow
the route of the French canal back to the
Atlantic side. Alternative routes will
then be considered and their investigation
undertaken. We shall be kept at the
Isthmus for probably three months. We
shall of course avail ourselves of all the
best existing means of travel, but expect
that some of the journey will have to be
accomplished on foot."

ANY ONE CAN MAKE
CYANIDE OF MERCURY
Testimony of a Chemist in the Mo-
lineux Poisoning Case at
New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3.â ln the trial of Ro
land. B. Molineux for the murder of Mrs.
Katherine J. Adams the most interesting
testimony to-day was that of John P. Yo
cum; a chemist and a warm friend of
Harry Cornish. He said that any chemist
could make cyanide of mercury, the poi
son which is alleged to have caused the
death of Mrs. Adams. He had made it
himself' and the process was easy. He
took Prussian blue and yellow oxide of
mercury, boiled them together, filtered the
mass and the precipitate contained Cyan
ide of mercury. Still other drugs would
yield cyanide of mercury. All of the
drugs required were what is known as
dry colors. Molineux, It will be remem
bered, was superintendent of a dry color
factory in Newark. Yocum testified 'that
any man known as a chemist could pro
cure the ingredients of cyanide of mer
cury even without registering his name.
Alvln A. Harpster, who has figured as
a friend of C.ornish and as an object of
Molineux' s hate, had been expected to
give important testimony as to Mollneux's
ill will toward Cornish, but his examina
tion to-day developed nothing important.
Andre Bustanoby, an employe of the
Knickerbocker Athletic Club and who had
been, he said, "very friendly" with Mol
ineux. testified that when the fac simile
of the poison package address was pub
lished he recognized the handwriting as
that of Molineux and told Secretary Ad
ams of the csub of his discovery-
Other witnesses were policemen who
were connected with the case after the
murder; clerks In patent medicine houses,
who handled the "Cornish" and "Bar
nett" letters alleged to have been written
by Molineux, and members of the. Knick
erbocker Athletic Club to whom Cornish
hart phown his Christmas present, whose
contents afterward killed Mrs. Adams.
Their testimony built up the case of the
prosecution, home of them were not
cross-examined. Â¦--%Â¦
CUBAN PRISONERS FREED.
Justice Done to Men Who Had Been
Held "Without Trial.
HAVANA. Jan.' 3.â General Wood to-day
issued an important order, giving freedom
to forty men in the province of Santa
Clara,* Some of them had been detained
without trial and others were suffering
excessive punishment. AH had been re
leased ten months before by an order Is
sued by General Bates, but they were im
rr.odlatPly rearrested on orders from divi
sion headquarters on the ground that a
dfp.-irtment commander did not have, the
power to pardon. After looking carefully
into thf> cares. -Governor 'Wood decided
that the Jud^m^nt of General Bates re
garding their release was wise and conse
quently to-day's order setting them at lib
erty was promulgated. Reports from
other departments are daily expected, and
it Is believed that before the end of the
month large- numbers will be released, es
pecially In the province of Havana. The
cases of those who have been held for a
long time In detention without trial will
b<Â» the first to be investigated.
DECISION TO FAVOR BRITONS.
Rumors- That Portugal Must Pay
Five Hundred Million Francs.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyright, 1900. by James Oor
don Bennett.
BERNE, Jan. 3.â According to rumors
current here the Swiss arbitration court
will award 500,000.000 fraacs to British
claimants In the Delagoa Railroad case.
These rumors, however, are unauthorized.
Yolo Supervisors Organize.
WOODLAND. Jan. 3.â The Board of
Supervisors reorganized to-day by the re
election of Supervisor Fredrlcks as chair
man. The board will probably fill all the
positions at its disposal on Wednesday.
HAVANA. Jan. 3.â Yellow fever
statistics- for 1899, while not
alarming, ' show conclusively that
the fight against the disease is
not yet won. The report for De
cember shows: New cases, 70; deaths,
22; recovered, 30; under treatment, 25.
There are now seventeen cases In the
hospital. Of the patients twelve were
Americans and fifty Spaniards. Six of
the former and ten of the latter died.
Experts hold that the difference in the
ratio of deaths was due to the use of
alcohol. Comparisons of the whole year
with the ten preceding years is favor
able, but the last three months of 1899
were unfavorable. Since September 1
there have been elghty-threo deaths.
During the corresponding period In 1898
the total was ninety-eight.
A damaging feature of the situation Is
that after a 'year of American occupation
and all the work and money expended, it
is worse than during the final month of
the Spanish regime with its attendant
reconcentrados and troops. The weather
has been* favorable. There was' a dry
summer and it is now cool. The explana
tion offered is the great influx of Spanish
immigrants, who were .not acclimated,
and' who are huddled in the lower
quarters of the city. They were badly
nourished and were unable to resist the
disease. One prominent fact is the failure
of house disinfection to kill the germs of
disease. Every house In the city has
been disinfected several times.
It is not to be considered that there is
any alarm here. There is no epidemic.
The situation is identical with the fore
cast of many physicians and others, who
admit a lack of knowledge of conditions
controlling the disease.
DEPOSITORS SCORE A POINT
Execution Secured Against the Union
Savings Bank.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 3.â The depositors
scored another point in their suits against
the defunct Union Savings Bank to-day
and secured an execution against the
bank for $354,882 75. This Judgment was
obtained a few weeks ago by L. Argues
and others against the Union Sav
ings Bank. At that time Judge Lorigan
made an order staying execution. Attor
ney Welch for the depositors to-day asked
that that order be dismissed and an ex
ecution Issue against the Institution. At
torney Ed Rea of the bank opposed it.
Judge Lorigan granted the order for an
execution. . â¢
The bank will undoubtedly apply for an
injunction prohibiting the Sheriff from
levying upon the bank while it is in liqui
dation.
Attorney Rea became rattled when the
order was granted and remarked that a
few days ago Attorney Welch tried to
enter into a conspiracy with his father,
ex-Boss Rea. the president of the bank,
to have the latter force the remaining de
positors to engage Welch to sue for them
and to pay him o per cent.
Crandall Again on Trial.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3â The taking of
testimony In the trial of Frank Crandall
for the killing of John Bowman began
this morning. This Is the third time he
has been tried for the crime. Once the
Jury disagreed and. once Crandall was
convicted of manslaughter and sentenced
to ten years' Imprisonment.
MANILA, Jan. B.â The health offi
cers have found j a native with
all the Bymptonjs of bubonic
plague in a house in the "walled
city," where two suspicious
deaths have occurred. The patient has
been isolated and every precaution has
been taken to prevent a spread of the dis
ease.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â The War De
partment is. taking steps to prevent the
Introduction of trie plague in the Philip
pines, and Secretary Root this morning
called Into consultation Surgeon General
Wyman ot the Marine Hospital Service,
to discuss "the establishment of a quaran
tine system for the Islands. It was de
cided that the War Department should
adopt toward the Philippines a policy
like that it pursued toward Cuba in the
matter of the projection of health, name
ly, confine the maintenance of a quaran
tine system to the Marine Hospital Ser
vice, The report received by both the
State Department and Surgeon General
Wyman from Honolulu confirms the As
sociated Press dispatch relative to the ex
istence of the disease. It happens, for
tunately, that the Marine Hospital Ser
vice has already two quarantine plants
in the Philippines, while two of Its sur
geons are now on their way to Manila,
co that little delay will be encountered in
banning to draw a rigid quarantine line
In the islands.
Surgeon General Wyman has no con
firmation of the report that three suspect
ed.cases of bubonic plague have been dis
covered within the walled city of Manila,
but no attempt is made to conceal the
gravity of the situation should the re
port prove true. Still, It is said, a few
sporadic cases need not necessarily /esult
In an epldcmlo in the islands. Surgeon
General Wyman says the disease no long
er creates the dread it once did. because
it has been demonstrated that It can be
handled by modern science. It has been
stamped out of Alexandria, Egypt, Kobe,
Japan, and Vienna. Austria. The methods
of fighting It are the same as used against
smallpoxâ isolation, disinfection and sani
tation. The greatest danger is due to its
possible Introduction into new localities
through ambulant or walking cases,
which defy the surveillance of the au
thorities. One feature of the cases .which
is gratifying to the authorities, in view
of the possible outbreak of the epidemic
In the Philippines, is the fact that its his
tory shows that It docs not attack Euro
peans as readily as natives.
Surgeon General Wyman to-day re
ceived a long report from Surgeon Car
mlchael, who Is stationed at Honolulu,
bearing on the condition of affairs there
regarding the bubonic plague. Under De
cember IS the report says that five cases
and five deaths from what Is pronounced
to be bubonic plague have occurred in
Honolulu on the 11th and 12th inst. Dr.
Carmlchael says the presence of the dis
ease was not suspected until the morn
ing of the 12th, when a Chinese patient
died. An autopsy was held, the examina
tion pointing strongly to the fact that
death was caused by the bubonic plague.
Another case, also a Chinese, who had
died on December 11, was examined with
the same result. The symptoms previous
to death were high feverâ lo4 to 105 de
grees Fahrenheit, rapid pulseâ l4o to 150â
headaches, deliriums, vomiting and pain
and swelling.
The duration of Illness In two of the
cases was three days, and from three to
four days in the other cases. Strained
preparations from the Juice squeezed from
the enlarged glands showed the presence
in large numbers of a short bacillus,
rounded at both ends, and closely resem
bling that of bubonic plague.
Dr. Carmichael says no new cases have
been reported up to December 18, and con
cluded his report as follows:
"I shall adopt all measures within my
power to insure the safety of vessels leav
ing for United States ports, but the ab
sence of a plant for disinfection here Is
severely felt at the present time, and in
view of this fact additional precautions
should be adopted at all Pacific Coast
ports and such measures should insure
the destruction of all vermin on board
vessels."
AGUINALDO LIBERATES
ALL SPANISH CAPTIVES
MADRID, Jan. 4.â The Spanish Consul
at Manila telegraphs to the Foreign Of
fice that the steamer Uranque, from Pa
nay, has arrived there, having on board
the Bishop of Vega, 117 priests, five of
ficers and 115 civilians who had been re
stored tcr liberty.
The Consul adds that Agulnaldo has
promulgated a decree ordering the libera
tion of all Spanish prisoners without dis
tinction. The Consul distrusts Aguln
aldo's motives on account of the attitude
of the Filipino chiefs, who, he believes,
place difficulties in tho way of the libera
tion of the prisoners.

CAPTAIN OF MARINES
INGATE DIES AT GUAM
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â The Navy De

on December 25. His death followed a
surgical operation..
BDTTB. Mont, Jan. Z.â Smallpox has
broken^ out In Butte City, Mont.,
and despite the efforts of tho
health and police authorities tho
dread disease Is spreading. It Is
believed by many that the pest was
brought in by the Montana regiment
that returned from the Philippines last
fall, and support was at first lent to this
belief by the fact that for some time the
doctors of the town were divided in their
opinion as to whether the disease so rap-
Idly spreading was . "Manila Itch" or
smallpox. The controversy waxed warm
for some time, and In the meanwhile pa
tients from all parts of the city were re
ported with alarming frequency. By the
time the disease was finally diagnosed
unanimously as smallpox there were
more patients than the town could take
care of, and the new cases. were being
cared for in their own houses.
The fact that the plague has fastened
on. Butte has been well kest from the
public. It is also known, although no offi
cial report of the fact has been allowed
to reach the world, , that Dillon, Mont.,
a small town near Butte, and Salt Lake,.
Utah, are nearly as badly off. Where it
came from is the question now being dis
cussed by the towns affected, but the re
sult of the discussion has not been satis
factory.
1 It is estimated that at present there
are 200 cases In Butte that are known to
the authorities, and, further than that,
there are at least 100 more unknown to
the authorities and cared for at their
homes. The town is in a state bordering
on a panic, â¢ and the health officers are
having a hard time to stem the tide.
There are no adequate preparations for
such an emergency, and the town Is taken
by surprise. The Mayor has ordered a
tent to be erected Just outside the town,
and patients are being sent to this im
provised camp as fast as they can be lo
cated. There is no pesthouse, ami there
are no provisions to check the advance of
the plague, so the excitement Is intense.
The first cases were discovered some
weeks ago. but the news was suppressed.
Nothing was said about it, even when the
disease was spreading, and it was not
until it reached serious proportion* that
it was allowed to become a matter of pub
lic concern.
Thero was no concealing the fact when
people began to be taken down with the
disease in the streets, in the stores and
in their homes. In Hennessy's big de
partment store four clerks on duty were
found to be Infected and they were taken
from their work to the isolated hospital.
A big building, known as Bennett's lodg
ing-house; was Investigated by the health
officers and it was found that several of
the inmates were affected with the dis
ease. The house was placed under quar
antine at once, but as soon as this was
known the inmates began to escape. Sev
eral living in the upper stories tried to
come down by the fire escapes and back
ways, and it was finally necessary to put
an armed guard of police on duty around
the place to keep the lodgers from leaving
the house and mingling with the people
of the city. They.were all finally placed
in Isolation. A physician, of the town
was being Bhaved In one of the prominent
barber shops, and happening to look
closely at the barber who was shaving
him* he saw the barber was breaking out
with the disease. The case was re
ported and the barber was sent to the
hospital. Last Wednesday a man walking
on the streets was spotted by one of .the
health officers. He evidently had the
smallpox, but the health officer said noth
ing .about it. Hft Just placed him under,
arrest, and while he waited for the police
to take him into custody five hundred peo
ple gathered around and wondered what
was the matter with the man in trouble.
On the same day an Infected elevator boy
in one of the large buildings was taken
from his elevator and sent to the hos
pital tent-
There was another man who was met
by h.ls family physician on the street.
The physician told him he had the grip
and advised him to go home, a sugges
tion he proceeded to act upon until he
met some friends. Under the idea that
whisky was an antidote for the grip he
proceeded to Imbibe in various saloons and
with numerous friends. In the mean
while his physician had gone to his home
to tell him quietly that it was not grip,
but smallpox that was ailing him. When
the doctor found that his patient, -instead
of proceeding directly home, had under
taken to prescribe for the grip himself, h.e
sent friends out to hunt him up and one
of these Informed the patient what was
the matter with him. The patient hunted
up the nearest policeman and tried to give
himself up, but when the policeman found
what was the matter with him he told his
prisoner to look out fox himself. '. Â¦ '.
The supposition that the disease was
brought In by the regiment returning from
the Philippines Is not given very much
credence, for before the troops left San
Frarrclsco they were held in camp for
three weeks or more awaiting, the 'muster
out. Smallpox is supposed to develop
within two weeks or not at all, so the
three weeks' detention of the regiment in
the Presidio at San Francisco after it
had come off the transport is believed to
have been sufficient to develop any latent
germs of disease had they existed.
The lack of preparation for such an
emergency has caused comment to direct
itself toward the health authorities of
the' city. There is no pesthouse and there
never has been one. When the first cases
broke out there was no place to put them
and then it was that the Mayor ordered
the erection of a tent for their accommo
dation. Following this the lodge of Elks
of Butte subscribed money to care for
their own members who might be afflicted
and it was not long before the fund was
more than occupied. Tho row among the
doctors as to what the disease was lasted
Just long enough to give It a good start
and now Butte is devoting what energies
it has to suppressing the news and con
fining the plague.

Governor Taylor's attorneys are prepar

Senator de Boe, are going much further
and attempting to show counter frauds
of a glaring nature on the Democratic

Colonel Whallen was arraigned for ex

Magistrate Thompson this afternoon and

In the Circuit Court -this morning Presi

the order of the court to turn over the
vault box alleged to hold the $4500 which,
it is claimed, was to be paid to Harrell.
in the event. he voted against Goebel in
the contest. Loving said he merely de
sired to protect the commissioners of his
company and his attorney moved to quash
the summons against him. This the court
overruled. .Thereupon a response was
filed to the rule for contempt.
In this response it is stated that "WTial
len, Harrell and Charles Ryan rented the
box In Question and deposited something
in it, the box being sealed up and cov
ered up with white paper. The trust
Company officials were notified not to
allow the box opened, except in the pres

Judge Cantrill adjudged the response
insufficient and ordered the box to be pro
duced In court at 11 o'clock to-morrow.
It is understood the order of the court
will be complied with, a motion for an
appeal to the Court of Appeals having
been overruled.
It Is said that an attempt was made to
have Senator Harrell Indicted in Louis
ville, where "Whallen's attorneys claim
the prosecution should have been insti
tuted if any offense had been committed.
The charge against Harrell probably will
be conspiracy or accepting a bribe.

whole, yet this is by no medss always the case.
In our great cities th*re Is plainly in evidence
much wealth contracted with much poverty,
and some of the wealth has been acquired, or
is used, in a manner for -which there Is no
moral justification. '
The chicanery and the dishonest, even though
not technically Illegal, methods through whtoh
come great fortunes have been made, are scan
cals to cur civilisation. The man- who, by
swindling or wrongdoing, acquires great
wtalth stands as low morally as any predatory
medieval m>bleman and is a more dangerous
member of society. Any law and any method
Of construing the law which will enable the
community to punish him. either by taking
ntray liis wealth or by imprisonment, ehould
be welcomed. Of course, such laws are even
more needed In dealing with great corporations
or trusts :than with individuals. They are
needed as much for the sake of "honest
corporations as for the sake of the public. The
corporation that managts its affairs honestly
has a light to demand protection against the
dishonest corporation.-
The chief abuses allegred to arise from trusts
are probably the following: Misrepresentation
and concealment regarding material facts con
nected with the organization of an enterprise;
the evils connected with unscrupulous promo
tions: . overcapitalization : unfair competition,
resulting in the crushing out of competitors,
â¢who themselves do not act Improperly; raising
cf prices above competitive rates; wield
ing of increased power -over the wage.-earners.
Rome of th'fe evils could be partially reme
died by a modification of our calendar laws.
Here we can safely go along the lines of the
more conwrvative Xew - , Kngland States and
probably not a little further. -Such law* will
tbeniti'lves provide the needed publicity and
the needed circumstanciallty of statement. We
ehouM know authoritatively whether stock rep
resents actual value. of plants or whether It
represents brands or good will; or If not. what
It does represent, if anything. It is desirable
to know how much' was actually bought; how
much was Issued free and to whom, and, if
possible, for what reason. This would enable
us to pee just what the public have a right to
expect in the way of service and taxation.
Where a trust bfcomfs a monopoly the State
has an Immediate right to Interfere. Care
Ehould be taken not to stifle enterprise or dis
close any facts of a business that are essen
tial'}' private; but the state, for. the protection
ot the public, phould exercise the right to in
epect. to examine thoroughly all the workings
of jrreat corporations, Just as Js now done with
bankp. and wherever the interests of the public
demand it. It should publish the results oÂ£ its
examination. Then If there are Inordinate
jtrotlts, competition or public sentiment will
Kive the public the benefit in lowered prices,
and if not the power of taxation remains.
Governor Roosevelt also devotes some
space to a. review of labor legislation In
New York and commends the work of the
Hoard of Mediation and Arbitration in
dealing with strikes during the past year.
He promises his approval of a drug
clerks' Mil to remedy hardships to which
men In that occupation are subjected.
The Governor recommends the repeal
of the Horton boxing law on the ground
that "when any sport is carried on pri
marily for moneyâ that Is. as a busings â
it is In danger of losing much that is
valuable and acquiring some exceedingly
undesirable characteristics. In the case
of prize-lighting not only do all the ob
jections which apply to other profes-
Flonal sports apply in aggravated form."
but in addition the exhibition has a very
demoralizing and brutalizing effect.
Moreover, the evils are greatly aggra
vated by the fact that the fight Is for a
money prize and is the occasion for un
limited gambling and betting."

GORBETT TO
BE TRAINED
BY McCOY
Date of His Fight I With Jef T
fries Advanced to March
: Fifteenth.
.\ :. Special IJtgpatch., to TnÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. . 3> Governor Roose
velt's vigorous attack, In his message to
the Legislature on the Horton law per
mitting prizefights in this State, was dis
cussed by numerous sporting men to-day.
The general opinion was. that the Gov
ernor would exert even* effort to have
the bill repealed and that the Horton law
would be wiped off the statute books be
fore the Legislature adjourned.
That local promoters of fistic events
j believe t;hat prizefighting In : Jfew York
will be prohibited, during the winter was
shown by James J. Jeffries and James 'J.
ICorbett agreeing to fight for the heavy
weight championship of the. world on
! March 15. This match was originally
scheduled -to take place in September.
William A. Brady, who" is' looking after
Jeffries' interests in ; the match, would
not admit that the change in the original
plans for the match had been occasioned
by the Governor's attitude toward prize
nghtlrifir.. but The Call correspondent sub
sequently learned that the. Governor's
firm stand against glove contests was,
nevertheless, the cause of the changing of
the date of the battle.
In addition to lighting Corbett, Jeffries
has agreed to meet "Tom" Sharkey In a
ring contest six weeks after his battle
with the; former- champion, provided
O'Rourke agrees not to second the sailor.
O'Rourke told Brady, in the conference
at Albany recently, that he would agr?e
to the condition named by Jeffries. Cor
bett will at once start In to train for his
bout .with Jeffries. He has asked "Ktd"
McCoy to look after him. Corbett and
McCoy talked tho matter over to-nlÃht
and McCoy said that If the financial ar
rangements were satisfactory he would
agree to train Jim. The Kid has promised,
to glva Corbett a definite answer within
twenty-four hours. Corbett will do his
preliminary work at a local gymnasium,
and about a month before the battle will
leavo for the country, -where he will put
on the finishing touches of his prepara
tion. ' â¢ " .
After the agreement to fight on March
15 was reported. Corbett said to a group
of friends standing near:
"I may rot whip Jeff, but I think I will
do the trickâ at any rate, I will give him
a black eye and a mark or two before it
is all over. Jeffries has been pretty lucky
In getting away without a scratch In all
Ills, fights."

Shields rul*d That the counsel for the ac

his copy of the contract if he wanted the
vaper as evidence. Mr. Rose then went
into a mimite examination of his witness
as to his personal knowl^ge of the open

presentation of claims on the contracts,
of certain checks said to have been issued
by Captain O. M. Carter, the engineer In

saying that the only points to be deter

prove that the indictment was untrue.

MIDWINTER SPORTING EVENTS
DEFEAT OF
BANNOCKBURN
BY FORMERO
Bullman, on . the Brown
Horse, Threw the Race
Away.
Jockey John Bullman caused the failure
of the California debut of Bapnockburn.
the former star of Pat Dunne's stable.
The grand looking son of Hayden Ed
wards Is now owned by Barney Schreiber
and went to the post yesterday a 1 to 3
chance for the closing mile run at Tan
foran. After he had raced San Venado
to a standstill Bullman began easing up
his mount the last seventy yards,* when
Ruiz on Formero slipped up on the out
side, stealing the purse by a head. Bull
man was as much chagrined over the re
sult as was his employer, who wagered
quite a sum of money on the brown horse.
It is safe to predict that "Bull" will draw
no more fine finishes. The winner was
10 to 1 in the betting.
The prospect of trying to* down some
very hot choices did not serve to increase
the attendance, which was again small.
Three favorites were laid low, the death
of Dr. Bernays being particularly sad and
pathetic, the reaper claiming him when
he seemed to be only galloping.
In the betting on the mile and a half
selling extravaganza Chimura seemed to
be the -"red ball for the corner pocket,"
as her price was boiled down from 6 and S
to 4. Fresh from his victories at Oakland
Dr. Bernays, whose odds receded just be
fore bugle call, quit badly the last quar
ter of a mile and Chimura rolled in win

Barney Schreiber annexed the first
purse with Foul Play. The filly opened up
at 3 to 1, when a stiff play compelled the
books to rub to 7 to 6. She broke first
and won all the way, with Tom Sharkey
a dangerously close second. March Seven,
a well backed one, made -a very poor
showing.
Corrigan's St. Cassimlr was scratched
from tne six-furlong sprint following,
which left The Lady to so to the post a
slight favorite over Sunello. The latter
colt was cut oft during the early stages of
the running, and the favorite, with Nabe
Hill up, won in a canter. Driving hard.
First Shot finished second, a head before
Gllssando.
For the first time this season the colors
of Nick Hall were seen here, worn by
Bullman on Facade in the mile selling
run. Five and six to one was laid against
the Fabulous gelding, and in a long,
gruelling drive, he downed the favorite,
Wallensteln, a head. Marty Bergen, on
Pat Corrigan's Racivan, ran. third.
A 7 to 10 favorite, Corrigan's Sardine,
made a gallop of the five furlong spin for
all ages. Ben Led! . showed her usual
streak of speed, but under the conditions,
was outclassed. She, however, took the
place from Rio Chico.
Track Notes.
The great stallion stake to be decided
during the State Fair at Sacramento In
1902, closed on January 1 with seventy
seven entries, a truly marvelous showing,
and Secretary Peter J. Shield is to 'be
congratulated. This makes It the banner
stake of this kind, no other one in this
country ever having received over fifty
eight entries. Among the stallions repre
sented are: Imp. Ormonde, Imp. St.
Gatien, Imp. Candlemas, Imp. Bassetlaw,
Imp. Midlothian, St. Carlo, Sam Lucas
and Logan. It* is estimated the stake will
be worth $20,000. The Occident trotting
stake for 11)02 closed with ninety entries,
while in past years sixty-seven was high
water mark. Secretary Shields also states
that moro payments have been. made on
entries to the Occident stake to be decided
this year than ever before.
Jockey T. Walsh was set down on Mon
day for the balance of the meeting at
Tanforan by Starter Caldwell. for getting
left at the post on Decoy. Tuesday both
Vittitoe and Bergen were left at the post
and no such action was taken. There ia
nothing like consistency, even on the turf.

SEATTLE. Jan. 3.â The Stanford-foot
ball team defeated the All-Seattle players
here to-day by a score of 2S to 0. The
toam work of the college left nothing to
be desired. The Seattle men played al
most a purely individual game, their team
work being very wea3t. The visitors had
everything their own way. Captain Mur
phy of Stanford was the star player of
the day. He was laid out near the end of
the second half and had to leave the field
The Karne was played In the presence of
a large crowd. It was remarkable for
pretty kicking, and. although one-sided,
was " Interesting from the epectators
standpoint. . _.
Seattle kicked off at 3 p. m, and Stan
ford secured the ball on' her thtrty-five
vard llr.e. In the first half Stanford scored
three times, despite Seattle's strenuous
ffforts to arrest her triumphal mark, and
the Cardinal pcored twice jn the second
half. Stanford twice failed to kick goal,
and the score stood 2Sâ O.

The Finance Committee recommended
that bills amounting to $10,030 be paid.
Director Head said that the demands
were irregular and should not be allowed.
He charged that the other members of
the Finance Committee had for some rea
son changed their minds since the com
mittee met, on which occasion, said Mr.
Head, some of those whose names were
on the bills had said they would not rec
ommend them favorably.
"These bills, especially the $6600 aggre
gation for the C, F. Weber Company.
were illegally contracted and are not Just
debts against the city. I would like to
knr>w why certain members, whom I could
name, have changed their minds 7" Â¦
Director Stow replied very briefly ta
Head's remarks, and as no one courted a
debate. Head spoke again and repeated
his protest and the bills were passed.
Leaves of absence were granted to Miss
PL Luis. Miss A. B. Chalmers. Miss E. M.
Stafford and "Miss R. V. McFeely.
President Bergerot made a lengthy ad
dress to the board, reviewing the work It
had done during its term and emphasizing;
the many reforms It has inaugurated. '
Director Eells made the motion to ad
journ. It was Instantly seconded by half
a dozen members and while Mr. Head was
making his final speech the members
filed out. In the lobby one of the mem
bers remembered that, although the presi
dent had highly complimented the board,
there was such a desire to- adjourn that
no one .thought of^proposlng a . vote of
thanks to President ilergerot. ' . .

CATHOLIC TRUTH
SPREADS WITH
THE CENTURIES
Father Yorke Upholds
His Religion.
HE DEFIES ITS ASSAILANTS
LECTURE LAST NIGHT AT ST.
MARY'S CATHEDRAL.
Speaker Claimed That "Morality Is
Rotting Out of Puhlic Life"
and That Political Johs
Are Curses.
"Catholic Truth" was the subject of a
lecture delivered last evening at St.
Mary's Cathedral by Rev. Peter C. Yorke.
It was the first of a series of similar ad
dresses to be given under the auspices of
the Catholic Truth Society. An audience
that filled every pew in the cathedral and
crowded into the galleries greeted the
speaker.
Father Yorke spoke at length on the
force and strength of the Catholic teach
ings, arguing that they embodied the only
true religion. He deplored, what he
stated to be a fact, that "morality is rot
ting out of our public life," and said that
the spreading of Catholic truth offered
the only relief from the evil. Briefly the
speaker said:
It is Important that the beginning of the
new year t-hould also mark the beginning
of new activity in the Catholic Truth So-
clety. As we pass on from one year to
another we are reminded that time is n>et
init fast and that our lives are Ilowint as
rapidly as the slight of time. Here on
earth there is no i^ttlnK pl:ue for the soles
of our feet, for we are betng hurried en,
on, to some unknewn fate, and we begin
to meditate If we are filling the positions
tif uselu!neÂ«s for which we wore created.
We do nut think what is before us or what
will be our end.
We ask f>ur sou!s if there be nnt some
thins: everlasting. Our answer comes ac
cording to thp way in which we have been
educated or the truths that have been in-
Ftilled into us. This is the significance of
the Catholic Truth Society at the beelnnins
of this century. In Catholic truth and
Catholic faith alone we find comfort in
thinkinp of our future. I mean by Cath
olic truth and faith the religion of Christ.
If Christ war rlcht. Catholic truth must
be right, for it If truth for the whole world
âfor all men of all colors, for all time,
for all classes and for all religions. The
object of the church is to scatter Catholic
truth over the entire world. It is n church
fitted to every clafs and to every nation.
The speaker then referred to the per
secution to which the church had been
subjected in centuries past, but said that
reason and truth had finally triumphed
and that the church had reached a point
where it could defy every attack made
upon it and pnan its fingers in the face
of every bigot that dared assail it. He
drew a simile between the church and the
tree stump, apparently dead, but which
with the rains and the warmth of the
sun sends forth fresh sprouts and eventu
ally resumes more magnificent propor
tions than ever before.
Continuing Father Yorke said:
In Ireland they not only cut down the tree,
but burn It and scatter its ashes to the
winds. Catholic truth, however, prevailed
In the end and to-day It Is stronger and
grander there than ever. From the manner
in which others have taken up our teach
ings, piece by piece, demonstrates the force
of Catholic truth. The wonderful growth
of the church In America, the most en
licht?ne<l nation on the Klobe, is a matter of
congratulation.
It Is a pity that our truths and our teach
ings <tr< not have greater effect on those who
govern Uf. Morality is rotting out of our
public life. Money or a political Job Is the
ambition of too many men. Thi? cannot bo
on forever. Some day the people will call
their pen-ants to account for what they have
Ftolen from us. giving us so little In return.
Labor will rise up against capital, and
eventually our social and civic conditions
will Itecome purified. In Catholic truth we
find the remedy.

At this point the bailiff suggested that

THOMAS WANTS HIS MONEY.
Seeks to Enjoin Payment of Demands
Against the School Department.
J. M. Thomas, "for himself and such
other creditors similarly situated, who de
pire to share in the expense of action,"
has sued Auditor Wells and the several
hundred creditors of the School Depart
ment to determine the amount of offsets
and to obtain an injunction until a de
cree to divide the school fund proportion
ately among the creditors is entered.
Thomas, who is a merchant creditor in
the sum of $520, avers that the Auditor is
about to allow the claims of the teachers
for the demands of the teachers and jani
tors so that they will receive their money
in full from tho $70,000 to be paid into the

claims, be in violation of the agreement

creditors and the teachers agreed to di

CHINAMAN DISAPPEARS.
Witness in a Murder Case Sought in
Vain by Detectives.
Detective Ed Gibson spent last evening
in Chinatown searching for a missing:
wltnessjn a_Chinese_murder_case. _ The
witness, whose " name" is Won? Ah Toy,
was counted on to give some of the most
Important testimony In the case, and the
manner of his disappearance has yet to
bi accounted for.
For several days past Wong Gee Toy
has been on trial In one of the local
courts for the murder of Wong Kun Chee,
which crime was committed in the Jack
t-on-street Theater, August 7, 1898. At the
time of the shooting five witnesses
claimed that they could identify the
murderer, and one of these was Wong
Ah Toy, who accompanied Detective Gib
son to Siskiyou County, where the defen
dant was apprehended. Wong pointed out
the murderer to the detective, and until
tho present time has always manifested
a xvillinKneFS to appear against Wong Gee
Toy. Wong Ah Toy remained In China
town until a couple of days ago. when he
mysteriously disappeared, and tho of
fifers have so far failed to discover hts
whereabouts. Owing to the fact that he
was so energetic in the prosecution of the
case Detective Gibson has a suspicion
that he may have been spirited away by
friends of the defendant.

Can a Minor Go as
Ship's Mateâ Castle
to Be Fumigated.
A LARGE fleet of vessels made port
yesterday. Nearly all the over
due steamers delayed by the
southeaster came in and quite a
fleet of overdue sailing vessel 3
showed up. The Normandie, Cassard and
Crown of Denmark appeared up off th<*
Lightship during the day and were towed
In. They found the other fleet that got in
Tuesday at anchor off Meiggs wharf with
their "sails out drying after the rain.
The bark Nicholas Thayer came in from
Clipperton Island. She was to have loaded
guano there for Honolulu, but, like the
Bessie X., could not get a load on account
of the weather, so she came back to San
Francisco. The Bessie K. did succeed in
petting five tons of guano aboard, but the
Nicholas Thayer came back without a
pound.
The barkentlne S. N. Castle came In
from Honolulu and was placed in quaran
tine. She will go to the hulk to-day as
soon as the Australia is released and will
Godiva's Bare
Escape.
Swept by Tidal Wave
She Nearly Goes
Down.
THREE more of the overdue fleet
made port yesterday. All had a
terrible time of it off the Horn dur
ing the month of October and one
of them nearly went down under
a "tidal wave."
The arrival of the Louis Pasteur and
Jules Verne at Portland Tuesday and the
Normandie, Godiva and Cassard at this
port yesterday leaves to be accounted for
only one of the overdue fleet that was
caught in the October gales off the Horn.
That vessel is the French bark General
Neumayer and the underwriters now fear
that she was the vessel that was rumored
to be ashore at Cape Horn. All the ar
rivals report heavy .weather and some of
mem suffered to a great extent, while
one, the Godiva, was swept fore and aft.
The Godiva and Itajore left Newcastle,
Eng., in company for this port. Both ves
sels made very long passages and on each
of thorn 10 per cent reinsurance was paid.
The Rajore made port last week and re
ported a very hard time of it rounding the
Cape of Storms. Sunday last the Godiva
showed up off the heads and Pilot Meyer
boarded her. It came on to blow and tho
ship had to stand off ashore and it was
not until yesterday afternoon that she
showed up off the Golden Gate again.
She looked weather beaten and a closer
inspection showed that she had seen
heavy weather. Everywhere from cabin
to forecastle the storms had left traces
of their visit and not a man aboard was
sorry to hear the command, "Let go the
anchor," when the ship was off Meiggs
wharf.
Captain Trunks. In his report, says that
the month of October opened with heavy
weather. From the 3d to the 16th the ves
sel was almost continually under water
and the crew suffered in a corresponding
degree. On October 17, what the captain
describes as a "tidal wave" or. "surf
sea" broke aboard and. swept everything
movable on deck away.
The cabin skylights were broken and
four feet of water flooded the cabin. The
charthouse was washed out, life buoys,
binnacles, compass, lamps, ventilators,
etc., were carried away, the entire poop
taffrail was smashed, iron stanchions
were bent and twisted, the railing, of the
bridge was carried away, the keel of one
of the lifeboats was broken, the spanker
boom was snapped off and went overboard
with all Its attachments, the storeroom
was Hooded and many of the supplies
were ruined, the sail locker was flooded,
all the ship's signal flags and the cap
tain's binoculars were washed overboard,
the forecastle was gutted, and tho only
lucky thing about the whole affair is that
no one was hurt.
After the wave had passed the vessel
was fixed up as well as possible and the
Horn was finally rounded. From that on
the Godiva met with adverse winds, her
hard luck following her even to the Gold
en Gate, when she had to stand out to sea
again with the pilot aboard.
The Crown of Denmark, also from New
castle, England, had a pretty hard time
of it also. She caught the Godlva's gale
on October 20. A sea swept her from stem
to stern and not only started tho star
board bulwarks, but stove in the doors of
the forward house. The men's quarters
were flooded, and the cook, along with
his pots and pans, was swept out of the
galley. One of the Crown of Denmark's
crew was sick with the scurvy when the
ship came In. He will be sent to the*
Marine Hospital.
The French barks Cassard and Nor
mandie also had a hard month of It off
the Horn. The underwriter* were paying
15 per cent to reinsure both of them, so
the gamblers were happy when they were
reported off tho heads. The Cassard was
reported off Point Reyes at 2:30 p. m. and
did not get in until some time after the
Normandie; still she beats that vessel
over a week in the run from Swansea.
The General Neumayer, over which much
anxiety is felt, is now out 184 days from
Swansea. -
HERMAPHRODITE BRIG HARRIET G IN A SOUTHEASTER.
Mutiny on the
Harriet G.
"Green Hands" Make
Hard Work for Ofii
cers in a Storm.
MUTINY and heavy weather were
the principal incidents of the
round trip of the brig Harriet G.
between San Francisco and New
Britain. The venture was in the
nature of an experiment, and as
it has only been partially successful the
proposed line of sailing vessels between
here and the German New Guinea posses
sions may fall through.
The brig left here on July 29 last with
a green crew and there was trouble as
soon as the towboat cast her off outside
the heads. There were four men before
the mast and out of that number three
had never been to sea before in their lives.
All of them were fresh from the vino
yards of Sonoma County and were lured
Into snipping before the mast on the
Harriet G on the representation that they
were going to "a land flowing with milk
and honey," with dusky princesses to be
picked up for the asking. When the order
to make sail was given by Captain Way
land, the vineyardists were found in their
bunks "dead to the world" from seasick
ness. An attempt to get them on their
feet was made and failed. Then the first
and second mate, the one A. 8., and the
Japanese cook had to hoist the sails and
sheet -them home. All the way down to
New Britain there was trouble with the
men and once they made a bold attempt
to take possession of the ship.
When the Harriet G reached her des
tination the vineyardists from Sonoma
found their "land of milk and honey" to
bo all that was to be desired, but the
dusky princesses had a discouraging habit
of eating up men of an alien race who
presented themselves as suitors. The Ger
man control only extends about five or
six miles along the coast of the Islands.
In the Interior the natives are pronounced
cannibals, and during the stay of the
Harriet G a German trader named
Bucholz was captured and eaten.
These facts upset the calculations of the
would-be colonists. and checked their in
tention to desert. Captain Wayland
could get no one else to take their places
and much against his will he was obliged
to bring them back as "sailors" instead
of passengers. The voyage was nothing
but a succession of storms, and as the
three vlneyardlsts were as "green" as the
day they left San Francisco nearly all the
work fell on the first and second mate.
Needless to say the trip was not a picnic
for the men who could not or would not
work, and in consequence there was many
a scrap in which the "preen" hands got
the worst of it. No one on the Harriet G
wants to repeat the New Britain voyage.
"New Britain possesses the prettiest
harbor In the world," said Captain Way
land yesterday. "There are quite a number
of Germans there and the Catholics and
Wesleyan Methodists have missions there.
E. E. Forysath & Co. and the German New
Guinea Company own large concession?
and do a large business. A mall steamer
calls there from Australia about every
two months and a German steamer from
Singapore touches there occasionally. The
Harriet G was the first trader that
went there from San Francisco and I
think she will be the last. We have
brought back with us about 300 tons of
copra.
"The Interior of New Britain and the
Admiralty group are in the hands of the
savages and they are a bad lot. Wlille
we were there a German trader was mur
dered, and I suppose eaten.
"We had nothing but heavy weather
coming home, and sometimes I was afraid
we might never see San Francisco again.
On December 8 we carried away our main
boom and for four days thereafter we
were under storm sails. After that we re
paired damages and then it blew another
hurricane for three days. The brig rod*
well, but nevertheless it was a tryiug
time. We had three days of a good fair
breeze after that, 'and then. to port wo
had nothing but northeast and southeast
gales. We were off Point Reyes last Fri
day, but were driven off shore again. We
got a slant to-day and made port all
right." â¢ :/ "- ;;

for a decree of divorce from hi 3 wife.
Catherine Guibbiny, on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. Inflicted both physically
and mentally and through various means
and devices.
By way of introduction to his complaint
Guibbiny alleges that he married hla.wtf*
August 17, 1579. For many years, he con
tinues, they led a life of content, but re
cently she has been making his life un
bearable. The first specific act of cruelty
alleged by the plaintiff occurred in No
vember of last year. At that time, he al
leges, she attempted to throw a lighted
lamp at him and was only prevented by
the hasty intervention of their daughter.
The following night at their home, 114
Slckels avenue. Ocean View, Mrs. Guib
biny, in the dead hour of darkness, pro
cured a kettle full of boiling water and
was about to enter his room for the.pur
pose of scalding him when Miss Gnibblny
again intervened and saved him from seri
ous injury. Again, he alleges, she threw
a kettle of boiling water at his head, ius.t
missed him and made a hole in the' pias
ter. Â¦ : â¢
Guibbiny. continuing, says that almost
daily his wife has threatened to kill him,
ha 3 daily nagged, abused and ill-treated
him until life has become a burden, hia
health Injured and his employment en
dangered. At times s'ae threatened, to
poison him. used various degrees of lan
guage toward him and on s.everal occa
sions expectorated in his face. Again sho
attempted to stab him, but with the as
sistance of the neighbors he finally dis
armed her and saved his life.
Since they took up their present resi
dence Mrs. Guibbiny is charged by her
husband with having pursued dally a syy
tematlc course of persecution until ?ho
has made his home "a veritable hell."
She has thrown beer in h!3 face, he avers,
dri\ - en him from his home, caused him
to call upon the neighbors to assist him
in subduing her, forced him to guanl
against poison that "she might not rid
herself of him, whom she no longer
loved," and. drove him to find his meals
at places other than his home.
Mr. Guibbiny attributes all of his woo
to his wife's intemperance, which, he
says, interferes with her family duties,
disturbs her temper and makes her home
a veritable pandemonium. â¢ â¢ .
In addition to a decree of divorce Mr.
Guihblny prays for the custody of his
daughter, Josephine Guibbiny, and asks
the court to make such disposition of the
community property, which consists of
money and real estate, as may bo found
proper and in accordance with justice.
be fumigated in order to kill all the rats
that may be aboard. Quarantine Officer
Klnyoun is more afraid of the rodents
carrying the germs of the plague Into San
Francisco than he is of any of the steer
age passengers who may come here on
the vessels. In consequence, a vigilant
search for rats goes on aboard the quar
antined craft all the time they are under
surveillance.
The British ship Montgomeryshire will
leave port to-day for England flying two
handsome flags that Captain Edwards
had presented him in Yokohama for the
very smart trip be made from Antwerp
to Japan, via Australia. On that occasion
the good ship made the record run of 126
days. On his arrival Captain Edwards
was given a magnificent silk flag by the
agents of the vessel. It Is the Japanese
national flag and has over the top and
bottom of the sunburst the words "Ant
werp-Yokohama." Worked around the
edges of the sunburst are the wordd
"Montgomeryshire - Captain Edwards,"
while in the center of the sunburst are
the letters and figures "R. 126 D." A sim
ilar flag was presented Captain Edwards
by his brother Masons In Yokohama and
to-day he will fly both of them at the
foremast head as the ship is towed to sea.
The courts will have a nice little case to
settle in a few days. The question is:
"Does the fact that a person is under age
debar him from getting a mate's ceitl
flcate of an ocean-going vessel?" There
is no law to that effect, but Secretary
Sherman ruled in IS7B that a minor could
not go as mate of an American vessel and
no one has questioned that decision since.
Now Edward T. Huffman, second mate of
the Fort George, is going to bring the
matter up.
Huffman is 19 years old and has been
second mate of the ship for a year. He
is prepared to get a mate's papers and
went before the Inspectors of hulls and
boilers to be examined. Messrs. Bolles
and Bulger refused to test his capabilities
on the ground that he was a minor and
Ineligible under Secretary Sherman's rul
ing. Huffman is not satisfied with this
state of affairs and is going to apply to
the courts to compel the inspectors to ex
amine him and grant him the desired cer
tificate. Huffman's contention will be
that there Is no law governing the case
and that in the English mercantile marine
a minor can hold a mate's license.

Brothers' Navigation School have received
licenses from the United States inspectors
of hulls and boilers: Mastersâ P. C. Rass

5YUKON MAP COPYRIGHT.
A. L. McDonald has filed a suit in the
United States Circuit Court on behalf o?
the United States as well as himself to
recover $112,000 from M. H. de Young for
having published in 112.000 copies of the
Chronicle of December 30, 1897. a map of
the Yukon Gold Belt, which McDonald
alleges was an infringement of his copy
righted map of the same district. Tn*
complaint asks that $5G,000 of the damagec
be paid to the United States and $sG,*>oo
to himself.
Under the- Revised Statutes one-half of
the penalty in such cases- goes to the
United States, and the damages may be
assessed at one dolar per copy of the pub
lication of the alleged infringement. The
fact that the Chronicle published 112.000
copies of the map is ascertained from the
statement published in the Chronicle to
that effect.

PHILIPPINE PLOTS.
*~T~"ITUS OATES was not the first man nor the last
to understand the value of a well discovered
plot in diverting men's reason from an offen-
The usefulness of plots is not exhausted now, and
ue may expect that the political Hawkshaws will do
a good business in discovering them among the peo
ple in our new islands for a long time to come.
It may be true, too, that such plots as that gladly
disclosed by the censor at Manila will be found to
exist. We have often said that the Philippine conquest
will make heavy and permanent garrisons necessary,
and that whenever costly military vigilance is relaxed
there will be violent outbreaks against all unguarded
Americans. The reported plot for an uprising in Ma
nila while the military force was occupied with thi
Lswton obsequies is precisely in line with this expec
tation. In the account as sent appears the fact that
the native population of Manila, of all classes, is su'
ler.ly inimical to the Americans. Meditating revenge
for what they have determined to be unjust treatment.
they arc reported to have prepared to inflict it, and a
tragedy was averted by timely discovery. Accepting
the whole report as true, it proves a condition that
fihouid open the eyes of everybody in this country.
Manila has been in oijr hands more than a year. Such
government as it has had has originated with Ameri
can authority. The Peace Commission and others
have given much pleasant information about the hap
piness and contentment and loyalty of the natives un
der the sample of government which we have fur
nished to them. The improved sanitation, the pater
rai prevention of cocktighting and gambling and the
other elements in our civil policy brought to their
notice have been represented as such an improvement
opon Spanish methods that the natives were enam
ored of thcin.
It need not be repeated that those who are ac
quainted with the Asiatic, and especially with the
Malay, character have not been deceived by these re
port *. Ncr have those at home been deceived who
know how little the rosy reflection represents the true
situation. To our military forces in the islands the
ratives are "niggers," and even our colored troop
have treated them as inferiors and laid upon them
burden? that will some day be told and will smite the
conscience of this country. We do not pretend to
s:y that the beÂ«t and moÂ«t upright government im
f,oÂ«ed coon them by force would be met by their un
flinching !c}-alty.. .We do not believe that it would.
any more than we believe that more than half a cen
tury of British rule forced upon the Cape Colony
Dutch has made 'them loyal subjects of Great Brit
ain, or that seven centuries of the same rule in Ire
land has m.ide its yoke lighter or its burden less.
History is scarce of instances in which the rule of any
conqueror, good or bad. has placated the conquered.
The sorroivful crux of the whole situation is that,
having taken territory which carries a hostile and in
d:gnant people, having violated the safe rule for na
tions and the canon of republicanism laid down l>y
Mr. Blame. w.e may as well lay aside all talk about
benevolence, education, sanitation, economic better
trcnt and religious enlightenment, and understand
that' we are like other conquerors, and those we
trample on are iike other conquered people. A sense
of injustice has pjanted in them a hereditary venom
that, time will not extirpate. We implore our mem
bers of Congress who should deal with this subject
<o; remember these absolutely fundamental and ttn
.chargeable conÂ«idcratiors.
' Even John Barrett, who is imperialist authority of
the highest rank. haÂ« repeatedly expressed exactly
this, estimate of the Malay character and has declared
that "w hen those people convince themselves that they
iaye been v.-ronged nothing ever changes them. They
zrizy subreit for a time. They may accept benefits.
T-hcy may show zeai for the interests of those who
have roused their sense of injustice, but they are only
tiding their time, and when it comes they strike with
'at hatred the more envenomed because of its lone con
ieralment. We believe that Mr. Barrett's estimate is
"correct. It :s the fame as was reached by Warren
Hastings and Robert Lord Give as to the more
truculent tribes of the Hindostan peninsula, and the
Scyoy rebellion proved them to be correct
With a Russian doctor trying to devise a rheans of
perpetuating life, and a French one working at ex

TO OPEN A NEW AVENUE.
Sunset Property Owners Preparing
to Cross Trocadero Gulch to
Mission Street.
It Is the intention of the Sunset Valley
property-owners to add one more drive
way from the Golden Gate Park to Mis
sion street, through the sand hills on the
south side of the park, by opening Nine
teenth avenue, i The undertaking has so
far met, not only with the Indorsement of
the residents of the valley, but the Super
visors have consented to. assist In the
work. The board has appropriated $10,000
for the Trocadero Gulch, which must be
filled in and bridged over before the ave
nue can be continued .. from O street,
whither it is now graded, macadamised
and curbed. The entire cost of the boule
vard will be $50,000, notwithstanding that
over one mile, from H to O streets, has
already been completed. Yet the distance
to Ingleslde. to which point the avenue
will ultimately extend, Is a long stretch of
territory. ; . "
One of the great obstacles of running
the avenue through has been overcome by
a concession from the Spring Valley Wa
ter Company for a right of way through
its land.
It Is intended â¢ that Nineteenth avenue
shall be a part of the city boulevard sys
tem, especially as the United States Gov
ernment's new reservation for fortifica
tion purposes I 3 situated on Ocecn road
and the Pacific. Ocean, and is most easily
reached by this driveway. The boulevard
will have additional charm, as it passes
for half a mile through thick woods, and
will be unique in this respect. It will
open up the district south of the park and
is virtually the only street on which of
ficial grades are established as far south
as Ocean road. It is destined to become
the principal avenue and driveway in the
thriving Sunset. District, south of Golden
Gate Park.
NICARAGUA OR PANAMA.
A COMPANY has just been incorporated in New
Jersey under the title of "The Panama Canal
Company of America." It has a capital stock
of $30,000,000, which may be increased at any time,
and the articles of incorporation set forth that the
company is organized for the purpose of acquiring
the property and rights of the Compagnie Nouvelle
dv Canal dc Panama, the French corporation which
now owns all the privileges and properties of the
great enterprise undertaken to construct a waterway
across the isthmus.
It can hardly be doubted that the incorporation of
the New Jersey company is another step toward un
loading upon the American Government the Panama
scheme. The project has long been under considera
tion and has found powerful support in this country.
Some of the most influential papers in the East have
given if not an open adherence to the Panama com
pany at least an active support -in opposing the con
struction of the canal across Nicaragua. The fight
of the Panama men just now is for delay, and it looks
as if they have the expectation of getting from the
new commission a report in their favor.
Morgan of Alabama in the Senate and Hepburn of
lowa in the House have announced an intention to
bring forward a Nicaragua canal bill and of urging ac
tion upon it at this session without waiting for the
new commission to report. A bill thus advocated
would be of course a non-partisan measure, and as
both Morgan and Hepburn are strong and expe
rienced parliamentary leaders their chances of forcing
a hearing on the i?sue are good. Naturally the
Panama promoters are averse to even so much as a
debate at this session, and consequently there prom
ises to be a vigorous fight in the committee-rooms as
soon as Congress gets back to work.
In the meantime the press, so far as it is controlled
or influenced by the advocates of the Panama scheme,
his been set to work on a campaign of education.
The cry is one of strenuous objection to any action at
this session. Some of the arguments are utterly un
fair. For example, no less a paper than the Boston
Herald in commenting upon the determination of the
two leaders to br.'ng up the question at once says:
"We have no wish to accuse Messrs. Morgan and
Hepburn of interested motives, but it must be evi
dent to any one that if they were financially concerned
in the purchase by the United States Government of
such alleged rights and equities as the Nicaragua
Canal Company possessed this would be precisely the
way in which they would be likely to act."
The unfairness of that insinuation against Morgan
From the ease with which the Boers will be able to
get supplies by way of Delagoa Bay, provided the
British blockade there be decided to be a violation of
the law of nations, it would appear that a small na
tionjn time of war is better off without seaports than
if it'had them. If Delagoa belonged to the Boers it
would be of no use to them, but so long as it is in the
hands of neutrals they can use it for all it is worth.
The number of immigrants who entered New York
during the last three months was so large that it is
expected this year will bring a veritable army of im
migrants to our shores to share in our prosperity,
and if we are to have an adequate restriction law on
the subject it is about time for Congress to get at it.
The railway magnates of the country are complain
ing that they lack cars to handle the freight that is
offered them; but at the same time they are fighting
with one another to see which shall get the lion' 3
share â or rather the hog's share, for when the lion has
all he can manage he knows he has enough.
The British appear at last to have learned some
thing from the Boers and are not making any more
blind rushes at the enemy before seeing him. It is
even probable that by the time Roberts arrives on
the scene Buller will have learned enough to get along
without him.
The announcement of the appearance of the bu
bonic plague in Manila is another warning of the
dangers that lie in wait for our soldiers in those
Asiatic islands. Imperialism may be a very fine thing,
but it costs more than it is 'ever likely to be worth to
this country.
From the frequency with which the Boers fire
plum puddings into the British lines at Ladysmith, or
send merry heliograph messages to their armies, it
would seem they look upon the war as a good joke
on John Bull and are enjoying it.
When the work of municipal improvement gets
fairly started it will be impossible to find a citizen
who will admit that he voted against the bond issues.
The fact that the Lawton fund already exceeds
$50,000 is a proof that the citizens of this republic are
not ungrateful even if those of others be so.
Now that the people have fully grasped the beauti
ful rose of promise contained in the new charter they
are beginning to feel where the thorns are.
We shall be pleased to see Oakland follow the exam
ple of San Francisco and give bonds for municipal
improvements. ?.;Â¦Â¦>

PUBLIC SCHOOL QUESTION
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
thÂ» opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of ireneral Interest.
Editor The Callâ Your editorial "The
State and Schools," which appeared In
the daily issue on Saturday, was timely
and in my opinion correct.
A very able paper was read before the
State Teachers' Association in Sacra
mento some ten years ago by J. L. Wilson,
then Superintendent of Schools of Colu*a
County. In this paper he deplored the
fact that there was a tendency toward
taking the control of the schools from the
people. His concluding words were to the
effect that he strongly favored. the demo
cratic principle of allowing each' district
to' control its own affairs. As wellmlijht
the State/attempt to take. control of all
other local affairs of a public nature.
The schools are in politics.
It Is the teachers 1 fault if they are. And
where would they be if authority of con
trol be transferred, pray? Would they
not still be in politics? Yes, and in my
Judgment in a worse condition than at
present. The State already has control of
the schools in the way in which it should.
Take away the people, and where is the
State? Take away the right of local self
government, and what have you done?
You have not only taken away all thc;r
Interest in educational work, but you have
struck a death blow at the fundamental
principles of our form of government. tJJ
The trouble lies right here. The univer
sities and State Normal Schools are turn*
ing out more teachers each year than
there is a demand for, and these institu
tions desire, through the State, to get con
trol of the public school system to further
their own endsâ to form a sort of public
school trust, as it were. Very truly yours,
C. J. LATHROP.

LIFE OF A NOTE^Constant Reader
City. By a transposition of numbers the
THE COMING LUMBER PROBLEM.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the New York
Sun, is one of those cheerful optimists who
#? hold an unshaken faith in the old belief that
our forests afford a practically inexhaustible supply
of lumber, and that notwithstanding the sweeping
away of the woods of the East there is still plenty left
in the West. In a recent article, commenting upon
the scarcity of pine in/Maine and the Lake States, it
says:
"Thus far it has not paid Pacific Coast lumbermen
to send much of their product East, so their surplus
has been sent to foreign markets. But when we begin
to draw more largely upon the Southern pines and
Northern spruce and hemlock it will certainly be pro
fitable to send Pacific lumber to the Eastern markets.
There is for us no serious prospect of a lumber fam
ine. The United States will continue to beat the world
in the variety, excellence and abundance of its timber
available for sawing. But we shall use a good deal
of soft lumber not so desirable as white pine."
Whether there be a serious prospect of a lumber
famine in this country depends upon how fat: into the
future the view is extended. There is certainly no
prospect of a famine this year or next, but within the
lifetime of a single generation the vast pine forests
of Michigan and Wisconsin have been cleared away
and those of Minnesota are rapidly vanishing. It was
once thought those forests were exhaustless, and the
man who talked of a serious prospect of a lumber
famine there would have been laughed at. We see,
however, what American energy and waste have done
in those States, and with that sight before us it re
quires no gift of prophecy to foresee what they will do
on the Pacific Coast if they are permitted to go on
unchecked.
Some of the facts set forth by the Sun itself are
sufficient to show the danger that is ahead. It says:
"Only a few years ago there were eighty large saw
mills in Fond dv Lac, Eau Claire and Marathon, Wis
consin towns; but now all have disappeared, and the
men who worked in connection with them have had
to change their business or seek employment in other
lumbering regions. More than 15,000 men are cut
ting white pine in Minnesota this winter, and their
wages amount to more than $450,000 a month. About
20,000 men are employed in the sawmills of Minne
apolis, and over 40,000 men in the State make their
living out of the lumber industry. They know that in
a few years more they must find other work, and many
talk already of following their present employers to
the Pacific Coast, where some of them are acquiring
large interests in the timber lands of Washington,
Oregon and California. Thus an army of axmen
will have crossed the continent, laying low the greatest
pineries of the country."
The destruction of Pacific Coast forests has gone
rapidly forward as it is. If to the present destructive
forces there be added this further army of 40,000 lum
bermen from the Eastern pineries cutting and saw
ing to supply not only our local demand but that of
the East as well, it will not be long before the pros
pect of a lumber famine will be serious indeed. If
we are to provide an escape from that impending
famine we must begin at once to preserve and to re
plant the forests as rapidly as we destroy them.
SHEARMAN ON THE BOERS.
\A R. THOMAS G. SHEARMAN of Brooklyn
/ \ is in the stock company of New York Tribune
writers who sustain the contention of that
paper for Great Britain and against, the Boers.
Mr. Shearman in a recent article begins his state
ment with a gentle reference to all who differ from
him "as Molly Maguircs," referring to a murderous
organization which once committed excesses in the
mining regions of Pennsylvania. With this index to
Mr. Shearman's frame of mind we may consider his
argument. He says: "If there is any business man
who has not had sense enough to see that British
defeat in South Africa would be a disaster to the
United States his eyes ought surely to be opened by
the events of the last few days. The three British de
feats in South Africa have already cost the United
States at least $100,000,000 in the tremendous down
fall of prices, the breaking up of confidence and the
certainty that but for extraordinary efforts on the pan
of bankers our country would have been involved in
a ruin as great as that of 1593. It is most astonishing
that intelligent business men who know anything of
the history of our country should ignore the inex
tricable involvement of ail our financial affairs with
those of Great Britain and forget the lessons of our
history, which show that whenever Great Britain has
been involved in a serious war, as in 1854 and 1857,
panic and disaster have occurred in the United
States."
Therefore the conclusion is inevitable when Eng
land chooses to go freebooting and to ride with a
hard hoof over a weak people in any part of the world
we must support her lest stocks decline!
Xo one denies the financial and commercial interde
pendence of nations, but to use it as an argument for
supporting criminal aggression upon an unoffending
people, lest the defeat of the oppressor work harm to
others not parties to the conflict, is to end all hope
of freedom in the world. Mr. Shearman is suffering
from a strange moral inversion. He puts England in
the position of influencing the world's prosperity to
such an extent that defeat in her schemes of conquest
and the overthrow of her armies spreads wide finan
cial ruin through the world. Why not combine, then,
and say to her that she is the trustee of the world's
fortunes and must behave as other trustees are by law
compelled to behave in fidelity to their trusts and in
loyalty to the trustors?
She entered the Crimean war, which was a quarrel
that began over the custody of the Holy Sepulcher
in Jerusalem â not that she cared a bean who po
liced the sacred edifice, but because it gave her a
chance to cripple Russia, her prospective rival in the
East. The Sepoy rebellion was the outgrowth of mis
government of her Indian empire. The case put by
Mr. Shearman is as if the trustee of many estates
should embark in unlawful enterprises and when chid
den by his trustors should answer that no matter how
criminal his actions he must be let alone, for if he fail
to win in his lawless ventures his trustors will be
ruined. Mr. Shearman is a lawyer and he knows that
such a trustee, instead of being permitted to make his
trustors particeps criminis, would be jolted off his
po c ition by the courts.
In addition to this reason for uttering a rather fine
article of Toryism Mr. Shearman is of opinion that
President Kruger is an uninteresting' old person, of
dirty habits, while admitting that he is pious. There
is no doubt that Mr. Kruger would fail to sustain
himself in a Brooklyn conversazione, and he may be
an unscrupulous economist of soap, but grave issues
of right and wrong are never settled by details of un
?prightliness or facts as to personal habits. Mr.
Shearmnn will see that one half of his objection to
Oom Paul would disappear in a bathtub, "and the
other half would probably yield to a few months'
training in chit-chat. But the principle of self
government in the South African republics is a per
manent principle, as precious there as in the United
States, or France, or Switzerland. Soap and water
and social graces cannot change it.
We are of opinion that American sentiment will
not come around to Mr. Shearman's view, and that
our people will still sympathize with republican self
government, though we may pell less pork and pow
der and the British trustee of our profits and for
tunes may fail to win in every hold-up.

and Hepburn is not redeemed by the ease with which
it can be reversed and applied to the Herald, for if
that paper were financially interested in the scheme to
sell the Panama property to the United States it
would act precisely as it is acting now. The plea for
delay, in order to make further investigations is at
tractive and appears~reasonable, but it must be re
membered that the routes have been under considera
tion for many years; they have been examined again
and again by commission after commission, and there
is no. reason for deeming the present commission any
wiser than some of its predecessors.
At some point in the history of every enterprise the
discussion must end and action begin, otherwise it
never will be an enterprise. The majority of the peo
ple of the United States are not partisans of cither
route, but they are desirous of ending the talk and
beginning the work and will support Morgan and
Hepburn in their efforts to have a decision made this

CONTRACTORS FINED.
Campbell & Pettus Showed That
They Had Paid for Overtime
Worked by Their Men.
James Campbell and Thomas A. Pettus,
contractors for the construction of the
Naval Training station at Goat Island,
were fined $25 each yesterday by United
States District Judge de Haven for vio
lating the Federal statute prohibiting the
employment of workmen on Government
works for more than eight hours per day.
The contractors showed to the court that
they had worked their men overtime at
the men's own request and with their
consent and that they paid the men a
day and a quarter's wages for each day
so employed. Hence only a nominal line
was imposed.
The complaint was made by Harry M
Saunders, walking delegate for the Buildl

BATE WAR AVERTED.
Western Boads and Trunk Lines In
sist on Their Standard Pro
portions.
The threatened transcontinental rate
war to follow the squabble of the New
England lines over the matter of differ
entials has been averted by the firm stand
taken by the Western Passenger Associa
tion at its recent meeting at Chicago and
by the like action taken by the trunk
lines at their meeting held recently at
New York. They have all agreed that. If
the Boston and Maine, Boston and Albany
and Fitchburs: lines Â¦wish to do any cut
ting, they will have to stand the expense
of the fun themselves.
The Trunk Association and the West
ern Passenger Association have reached
an understanding by which they will in
sist on receiving the full standard rate
proportion on all tickets sold over their
lines. This reduces the margin on which
the quarrelsome ones have to war to such
a small figure that they cannot afford to
go on with the tight without damaging
themselves more than they can possibly
hurt any one else. The best reduction they
can mane and still pay the rate propor
tion over to their connecting lines is so
small as to cut practically no figure what
ever in transcontinental traffic.
Circulars were received yesterday from
all the principal trunk and western lines
notifying thos-j interested In the matter
of the btand taken in the controversy.

TOMMASO SALViNI AS OTHELLO.
with like methods and results, and Wen
dell Phillips did not much bettter in his
oration on "Toussair.t l'Ouverture." There
is a race prejudice in such cases that no
author may ignore. Shakespeare by his
tact foresaw Just how his audience or
reader would naturally regard Othello,
and found a way to present the char
acter so as to teem really fascinating.
There are but two steps in the process:
First, mislead imagination, then dis
abuse it; degrade the given personality,
then correct it by revealing its worth and
nobleness. So here Shakespeare, before
hÂ«Â» lets us see his hero, makes lago and
Roderigo belie him viciously. When we
discover at the opening of scer.e 2 the in
justice of their enmity, we nnd aroused
in us the partiality for Othello that the
piece requires. If you wi3h to engender
sympathy for a man in your community
who perhaps is not much thought of, get
somebody to traduce him publicly. To
launch his chief character Shakespeare
uses thus an evident principle of human
nature constantly Illustrated in outside
life
The next important problem taxed the
author's art more seriously. In an elope
ment such as here our sympathies o#
course are with the parent as against the
daughter. Shakespeare must make us un
equivocally decide against the father, and
in the face of the traditions and conven
tions of good order and good society. We
at the first assume, so far as we are
conscious of prepossessions at all. that
Desdemona is no wiser or better than she
should be to leave a patrican home like
hers and run off with a blackamoor. She
ought to have realized her privileges and
kept the respect of her friends. But the
moment that we have seen Othello and
caught the significance of his noble and
fearless bearing we unconsciously indorse
Desdemona'a choice. And when presently
her father is made known to us in his
grand faith In his daughter's integrity and
devotion, we do not feel the least interest
in him, but on the contrary think him
rightly served. If we lived in the same
street or city with him we should feel
quite differently. Perhaps not one in a
thousand among the readers of this p!ay
even stons to realize the plight of Bra
bantlo, as he goes back to his empty pal
ace to die of a broken heart, with no whit
of sympathy from his brother Senators or
from us. He Is a good manâ perhaps the
worthiest male personage In the play
but Shakespeare has made us ignore that.
He is high bred and of the sel^ctest cul
ture, but we do not care. lie is doubtless
a collector of Greek manuscripts and an
tique gems, like Romola's father, yet it
does rot signify one jot. But it would
p!a:nify very much indeed If Shakespeare
did not stand between us and the man.
How has the author succeeded in mak
ing us so ungenerous antl unjust? As ha<
Just been said, he could not do this with
a real Brabantlo, living in our circle or
our sight. He must have stirred our
prejudice against the man and have kept
from us the truer, more characteristic
things. That, in a book. l.Â« not .Â«o hard to do.
The problem, we shall find, is after all a
simple or.c. Shakespeare has but to In
troduce him to us without his dressing
gown and get him rebuked by the black
guard lago. who has come merely to do
Othello mischief. The rebuke is, of course,
unmerited. The folk of this time wore no
clothing In bed. and Brabantlo. aroused
by the cry of "thieves." could hardly be
expected to step for clothing till he knew
whether the summons was warranted.
lago but pretends, since Brabantio I* pro
tected by the darkness from exposure, to
be scandalized. He delights in taking
down "the great ones <Â»f the city." being
an adventurer, and from this subordina
tion of DeÂ«demona's father we trace the
beginnings of our pretudice actilnst him.
Shakespeare's chiefest undertaking, in
the heart of the drama, is the mastery
of our sympathies to the point of con
senting that Desdemona suffer. She is no
Ophelia, insufficient to living, but a
strong, cultured, true woman, the best
possible product of the best blood and
breeding In the Christian world. No ordi
nary author. In attempting to array
Othello against such a wife, could achieve
sympathy for the husband. But Shakes
peare extorts from us consent not only
that Desdemona undergo the agony of los
ing her husband's favor, but that ne mur
der her even in our sight. We are apt to
take ftor granted too many things in read-
inconsistency, be unjust and paltry In tha
small. He hears the maudlin revelry
which breaks the peace of Cyprus and
punishes like a god. With the same re
sponsibility he hears the voice of a victim
smitten in the darkness and slinks away
like an Italian stabber.
But the art of "Dthello" cannot be ade
quately discussed in a single paper. With
the fourth act closes the author's effort
with the two problems. The fifth act
brings on with fresh resources and ex
pedients of sklil the issue of the whoie.

VIST INCREASE
LOOKED FOR IN
ORIENTAL TRADE
Santa Fe Will Have a
Bonded Dock.
HARBOR BOARD TAKES ACTION
MAIN-STREET WHARF SOON TO
BE ENLARGED.
Realizing that In the near future there
will be a vast increase In the Oriental
trade of this port, the Harbor Commis
sioners are beginning to take measures
looking to the betterment of wharves and
docks in anticipation of such improved
commercial conditions. An important step
was taken at their meeting yesterday,
when it was decided to make more room
at Main-street wharf for the freight of
the Santa Fe Terminal Company and the
California and Oriental Steamship Com
pany.
In a letter dated October 3, 1599, the Cal
ifornia & Oriental Company asked the
board to set aside a covered wharf for
the exclusive use of the two lines men
tioned and, in a communication of recent
date, read at yesterday's meeting, in
quired If anything had been done toward
giving them a permanent location. The
two companies will be notified that such
is the intention of the board.
Chief Engineer Holmes was directed to
prepare a report on the feasibility of
widening and lengthening Main-street
wharf, trie idea being to provide a bonded
dock for the Oriental trade. The Santa
Fe line has purchased several lots near
the dock, which before long will be cov
ered with freight sheds.
Engineer Holmes reported that he would
soon submit plans for the new Fisher
men's wharf at North Beach, and that
as soon as that matter was disposed of
he would give his attention to the building
of a new dock on the site of the present
Fishermen's wharf.
Ex-Governor Budd was present at the
meeting in order to have a resolution
adopted directing him to represent the
board before the . Supreme Court next
Monday morning, when the mandamus
suit of H. G. Walker against the board
for $117 75 will be taken up for argument.
Walker alleges that amount to be due
him for worKing overtime as switchman
on the Belt Railroad. As the decision will
affect several State institutions, the Com
missioners look upon the suit as a test
caee.

STATUS OF DIFFERENTIALS

THEY ABE WIDER THAN WAS
REPORTED.
Very Interesting news arrived from the
East yesterday. This is contained in the
revised "official classification." so called,
which has been In effect on the railways
east of the Mississippi river and north of
the Ohio river since the opening of the
new year. The value locally consists In
the light that It throws upon the pre
cedent that . has been made against St.
Louis and the Middle West Jobbers gener
ally In their fight against the Jobbers of
the Pacific coast. The impression that
has previously been gained by perusal of
the articles that have appeared over the
signatures of Van Landlngham of St.
Louis, to the effect that St. Louis would
be hard hit. is confirmed. The classifica
tion makes the differential in the territory
of which St. Louis is at the extreme west
ern edge, much larger than the Parlflc
cÂ«ia;<t differential of which the Middle
West jobbers have complained as being
unjust.
Attorney General Griggs, when he de
clined to take any action, on the ground
*hat there was no violation of the anti
trust law, left the matter in the hands
of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The railways in the territory north of the
Ohio and west of the Mississippi had not
combined to raise rates. They had agreed
upon a plan of classification. This w&s
an agreement as to how they would do
business among themselves, so far e.s the
legal aspect of the case was concerned.
There are Jobbers here who think that the
differential part of the fight to protect th*>
business of the Pacific coast has been at
least half won. The reason for this idea
is that the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has F.inetloned differentials and so
has established a precedent in that direc
tion. Indeed the Interstate Commerce
Commission is reported to have favored a

IX. OTHELLO.
"Othello" as a Masterpiece.
The "Othello" has been held by many
critics, and notably among them by Mac
aulay, the chief artistic production of
human genius. It would seem that these
authorities must have mis?ed Shakes
peare's achievements of this sort in
"Antony and Cleopatra." We may, safely
account "Othello," in point of art, the
second of the world's literary master
pieces.
Remembering that art is the means an
author uses to bring to his readers the in
spiration and vision of his own mir.d, we
shall nnd it easy to identify the more im
portant feats and strokes in the present
play. Shakespeare, because of the na
ture of his material, was obliged to re
sort to art at the very outset. The hero
and title character is of a supposed In
ferior and degraded race â a Moor. It
would have been futile to assume the in
terest of the audience in such a person
age, for the thing has been tried unsuc
cessfully in literature and oratory often
enough by others. Longfellow experi
mented with Hiawatha as a hero, pre
senting him precisely as if he were of
Anglo-Saxon blood and name; but though
the product is In reality a character per
haps as noble as Othello, we find it almost
impossible to take it seriously. Mrs.
Aphra Bean wrote a novel. "Oronokoo."
with a West India negTO for the hero,
Ing Shakespeare. A tragedy by a noted
modern playwright, brought out with
great expense an<l skill in London a few
years back, at the moat moving moment
aroused a titter throughout the audience.
That is one of the things that do not hap
pen in proper renditions of Othello. Nor
again is there revolt or hissing or outcry
when Othello, with his frenzied fingers,
crushes the fair neck of Desdemona. No
audience ever thought of protest against
the course' Of things in a play by Shake
speare, and from that very fact we grow
blind to the power that sways ua.
After Shakespeare has revealed to U3
the heart and soul of Desdemona in the
second act as fully as he dares' ha begins
to undermine her happiness. Here the
tragedy begins. We may say that the au
thor's task now resolves itself into two
problems. The first ia the evolution of
our consent that Othello punish Ca3Â»io
and commission lago to destroy his life,
this ending with the third scene of the
third act. Then comes the second prob
lem, the great work of the playâ the at
tempt to make us Justify Othello,
dramatically, in proceeding asralr.st Dea
demona also. Here there is need for the
handkerchief; here we see the reason for
introducing Bianca Into the play. After
Othello Is shown, in consequence of the
supposed falseness' of his bride. In the
agony of a swoon, we find ourselves pos
sessed by a compelling repect for the
man's integrity and strange pity for his
fate. When he sees Cassio laugh at the
lightness, aa lasro makes him believe, of
Desdemona, there is no place In his soul
for moderation. He Is by instinct a vin
dicator, an avenger. Yet. to be Just In the
large, Othello must, with' half-barbaric

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
FOR A NEW RAILROAD.
A Company Formed Which Will Con
nect a Vast District of Valu
able Property With the
Outside World.
Articles of Incorporation of the Jack
son, Sutter and Amador Railway Com
pany of California, organized to build a
road through Amador County, were filed
yesterday. The road will be built from
lone to Martell's station, to Jackson, to
Middle Bar, to Plymouth, via the towns
of Sutter Creek, Amador City and Dry
town. The length of the read is thirty
live miles. The capital stock is $2,100,000,
of which $40,000 has been subscribed.
The directors and subscribers are: E.
Van Etten. New York; Gustav L. Jaeger,
May wood, N. J.; Clarence L. Feusier, San
Francisco; \V. R. Woodard, Los Ange
les; Carl L. Jaeger, San Francisco; P. A.
Buell, Stockton, and L. Schumacher, San
Francisco.
This road, running as it does through
one of the richest mining sections of the
entire State, will open up that territory,
giving it a boom such as nothing else
could.
At lone the Jackson, Sutter and Amador
Railway will connect with the Southern
Pacific, thus bringing Its feeders in direct
communication by rail with San Fran
cisco and other markets.
The projectors of the new enterprise
cannot as yet definitely figure on the date
at which their undertaking will be com
pleted. But everything is being put In
shape to commence actual construction at
a very early date as. when once com
menced, work will be pushed ahead with
all possible dispatch.

JOHNSON ADMITS
HE CONSIDERED
A NEW CANNERY
Capitalists Had Cash
to Invest.
EASTERN MEN 1 INTERESTED
CONFEBENCE WILL BE HELD
VERY SOON.
Frank S. Johnson of the Johnson-Locke
Mercantile Company has returned from
the East and the gossip about the can
nery deal that he has been discussing has
been renewed with vigor. Johnson Is not
Inclined to say much about the matter,
but he confirms the statements that have
been made concerning his operations in
the East to some extent. In an interview
yesterday he denied that he had any in
tention of fighting the local canneries
combine. At the same time he admitted
that he had talked with Eastern men
about the establishment of a new cannery |
here. This was already known before the
arrival of Johnson from the East. It was
also known that San Francisco men were
working upon a cannery proposition in
connection with Johnson in this city while
he was absent. A story was afloat and is
credited generally that options were taken
East by Johnson for the purchase of at
least two canneries as a basis of a deal.
The statement is also made that a con
ference will take place in a day or two
at which Johnson will be present in ref
erence to the proposed cannery.
Here is what Johnson said yesterday in
so far as it affected the cannery matter:
"Before my departure for the East I had
been asked by some capitalists of this
city to assist in starting a cannery. My
dried fruit interests are very large and
a large cannery I have long desired as a
feeder to my dried fruit department. I
had some friends East who were anxious
to join me also in the inauguration of a
cannery, and while I was East I saw
them. I have not engaged In a search for
subscribers to any cannery organization in
the Eastern States and have not spoken
to more than half a dozen persons, all of
whom are ready to join me if I so desire.
It is not certain that I shall engage in
the cannery business directly or even col
laterally. I have a very large business
here and if a new cannery is inaugurated
here it will be because our firm cannot
secure the right kind of supplies from
those already operating.
"The public. In any event, need have no
fear that there will be at any time de
moralization of prices or any undue com
petition. We will not start anything in
imical to existing corporations nor will
we compete with them. I deprecate any
newspaper statements that we are or
ganizing anything to fight a trust. I do
not know of the existence of any cannery
trust here and the corporations now in
operation we have the most friendly feel
ings for and relations with."
try from the beginning of the official ex
istence of the body.
If it should be that the differential prop
osition is in as good situation as some
think then the entire matter at issue be
fore the Commission Is in very good shape
for the coast. When the hearing was In
progress in St. Louis in the suit concern
ing the Pacific coast, witnesses for St.
Louis gave signs of weakness in the mat
ter of urging the establishment of graded
rates to St. Louis westward from the At
lantic seaboard and the doing away with
terminals. Of course the grading of rates
would destroy terminals, the whole mat
ter of rates being under the graded rates*
upon a mileage basis. The realization of
this fact had caused such a protest that
the St. Louis people were clearly inclined
to weaken.
The reason that St. Louis took part in
the contest against the revision of the
official classification, so the jobbers here
say. was the dread of the precedent that
might be established. St. Louis being at
the western edge of the "official classMl
cation" territory would benefit by the dif
ferential in the matter of getting supplies
from the East. This consideration was
more than offset by the dread of wh^t
might be done to nffect the trade of St.
Louis west of that city.

New York Stock Market.
NnTV YORK. Jan. 3â The Etock market to
day was unable to resist the factors working
toward reaction, and closed at losses both for
specialties and in the rallroadF, running 1 to 4
points. A Â»--e:i;ns disposition was manifest
from the opening in sympathy with the earlier
declines In the London market, and the down-
ward tendency was resisted. A number of
the industrial etocks advanced in a somewhat
*xdted manner in the flryt hour and Induced
sympathetic hardening of prices ail through
the lift. Cor.foliiicteil Gas Jumped c points on
the report of its abForption of an electric light-
Ing company and incidental ndvantages in the
local eas war. American Tobacco rose an ex
treme 5 points, and the Continental Tobaccos
were strong. Sugar showed a disposition to
continue its advance, and seme of the Iron
and steel Blocks maintained yesterday's show
of strength in the group. Later in the day
there was a vigorous upward movement In
New York Central, with a slight sympathetic
rtifonse in other Vanderbllt nocks. The iso
lated points of strength in the market, how
ever, proved entirely insufficient to sustain
prices in the face of the constant dribbling of
ealea for foreign account and those for local
Account which were sentimentally influenced
by the weakness abroad. A rumor was circu
lated that Ladysmlth had capitulated to the
Boere. The effect was significant of what may
be expected from the pecurity market in cane
of farther reverses to the Hrltish arms in
South Africa, for traders who were long of
stocks hastened to take their profits in the
*AcÂ«? of the possibility involved. The later
news of the day made it clear that the real
source of the day's weakness was llerlin. Sell
ing from that center in London, and of Ameri
can securities in New York, was on a large
scale. Jt was taped- on the weekly return of
the German Imperial Dank, which showed &
Joss cf fJC.SOO.'H'iO In each, a lean expansion In
the face of this <traln of f12.500.0C0, and an
addition to the notes in circulation of upward
of fS3.CCQ.OOO was an exhibit of the pressure
for credKs in Germany which served rather
to startle the financial world. The effect was
not apparent, however, in the Berlin discount
market and fterlinK exchange advanced at Ber
lin, in epite of a further decline in interest
rates in London. Rerlin exchange in New York,
however, rose a fharp fraction. The stocks
Â¦which were ftr^npest yesterday did not entirely
lose their gains of yesterday, but in the case
of the Baltimore and Ohio eto<~Ks, Pacifies and
a number -of Southern stocks, laree inroads
Â»-ere made on values. Conditions in the local
money market were undisturbed.

London Financial Situation.
LONDON, Jan. Â«.â The financial situation Is
considered much more hopeful on the general
understanding that the bank rate will not be
raised to-morrow nor, according to expectation.
Is it likely to be raised In the near future.
It is learned by a representative of the Asso
ciated Press that the gold drain to be met at
present is Â£JOO.ono to the Argentine republic,
which Is believed to be fully offset by impor
tations from the United States and other cuun-
tries. Liquidations continue ,to Increase, and
the leellng toward American securities has Im
proved. The belief gains ground that the
United States will reap great benefit from the
South African war.
Government bills are somewhat weak on ac
count of rumors of a new war loan. On the

Chicago opened weaker on disappointing ca

firmer under the news from Berlin, but there
was another break on local bear selling on ac
count of rehashed Argentine news and ab
sence of support.

BOSTON, Jan. 3.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The new year has opened with a quiet but
hardening wool market. There Is no pressure
whatever to Bell. On the other hand holders
are firm In their Ideas and will not budse an
iota from what they consider to be a fair valu
ation on their stock. Manufacturers, however,
are not buying. Several of them are really
ready to take wool when offered to them
slightly under the market, but concessions are
not being made. The general belief is that the
present lull in business is only temporary and
preliminary to another period of pronounced
activity and strength. It Is thought that the
next London sales, which begin .January lt>.
will open on at least a parity with the closing
rates of the last series. If not hleher. The
situation abroad Is strong. The Bales of the
week In Bostcn amounted to 2,210.600 pounds
domestic and 235,000 pounds foreign, making a
total of 2.505,600, against a total of 2,350.000 for
the previous week and a total of 5,706,000 for the
corresponding week last year.

GKAPE-NUTS.
DOCTOR'S PROPHECY.
About Grape-Nuts.
Dr. J. 11. Hanaford, one of the oldest
physicians In Reading, Mass., says In
the Practical Age: "I firmly believe
that Mr. Post has rendered a greater
eervice to humanity than any other
man living In the matter of food.
"He claims -with propriety, I think,
Â¦that his new food. Grape-Nuts, made
from the most nourishing elements of
the grains, contains nourishment In one
pound equal to ten of meat, wheat, oats
or bread.
"From the acquaintance that I have
had with this unusually nutritious arti-
cle I am satisfied the statement is
truthful and demonstratable. I am In-
clined to believe the food "will effect
'considerable of a revolution In society,
to the extent that it is introduced."
This vtsls written by Dr. Hanaford
several months a|ro. The rapid spread
cf the use of Grape-Nuts all over the
country ha? demonstrated that the doc-
tor's prophecy has already come true,
to an extent, at least. Perhaps never
before in the history of food manufac-
ture has puch rapid progress been mad*
as -Kith Grape-Nuts. It especially ap-
peais to braSn workers.
All flrst-daÂ«s grocers furnish Grape-
Nuta, and the Postum Cereal Co., Ltd.
Battle Creek, MJch., are the makers.

ALLEGED BETBOTHAL.
Many Witnesses Give Evidence in
the Breach of Promise Case and

of His Lands.
Aged Joseph Boardman's young and
pretty wife was an interested spectator in
Judge Hunt's court yesterday during the
hearin- of the $500,000 breach of promise
"uU Instituted by Mrs. Elizabeth Glad
Â«one winy thl aged Oakland mlllion
a^frs Emma Stimson of Oakland was the
firVt witness. She testified that Boardman
W^s very friendly with Mrs. Gladstone
before his first wife's death and after
that time seemed to be even more affec
"ilra^Emma Waldron, the . claimant's
daughter, testified that the old man
seemed t Q be very affectionate toward her
mother, and one day, when he entered the
room where she was seated he saw a
picture of Mrs. Gladstone and said. Oh.
there is a grand womanâ a very grand
woman.'' Again Boardman visited at her
home and asked her to play on the piano.
He asked her to play "The Heart Bowed
Down " but she couldn t. so she played
him the "Black Hawk Waltz."
Mrs. Lucretla Graham said that Mr.

MR. BANNING BELIEVES
COLONEL STONE INSANE
MANAGER OF THE ZJLIPINOS
BUNS AMUCK.
Makes a Ridiculous Charg-e of Brib
ery and Is Informed That He
Is Committing a Felony.
Twelve Filipinos called at the office of
United States Immigration Commissioner
North yesterday morning and complained
that â¢'Colonel" Stone was holding them In
a starvfd condition in a tenement at. 756
Howard streeu There were seventeen of
them whom the colonel had been using in
the show buslnfss since the Mechanics'
Institute got through with them, and he
had failed to feed them sufficiently or
properly, they said, a sack of raw- po
tatoes being the extent of their larder.
Among the number are four women and
three children. . Commissioner North
placed himself at once in communication
with General Shafter, who promised to
send them home by the first Government
transport available. The Filipinos came
to San Francisco on a Government trans
port and were rffused a landing by Com
missioner North. But the Secretary of
War allowed them to come ashore for the
purposes of the Mechanics' Institute' Fair
last. fall with the understanding that they
were to be sent back to the Philippines by
the next transport. â¢
Colonel Stone called upon Assistant
United States Attorney Banning yeÃter
day and displayed his Ignorance of the
true situation of affairs by charging that
Mr. North had been bribed to allow the
Filipinos to land, whereas the fact was
Mr. North denied them a landing. Mr.
Banning stated that Stone told him
that he wanted to be revenged upon
North and get $.VX) o.ut of â¢him, otherwise
he wished to enter a charge of bribery
against him. Mr. Banning assured the
"colonel" that he was contmltting a felony
by offering to compound a felony, where
upon Stone admitted that he did not
know that he was about to commit any
offense. Stone was unable to produce
any witnesses in support of his false and
slanderous assertion, and left the office
after declaring that he would start at
once for Washington to lay the matter
before the Commissioner of Immigration.
Mr. Banning expressed his belief yester
day that Stone is Insane.

FANCY JUGGLING WITH
SALARIES AT STOCKTON
Old Positions Abolished and New
-. Ones Created at a Higher Wage
Bate.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 3.â A shrewd at
tempt on the part of the management of
the Stockton Insane Asylum, or State Hos
pital, in the polite usage which now ob
tains, to defeat the spirit of the revised
salary schedule was disclosed at a meet
ing of the State Lunacy Commission held
at a late hour this afternoon. It will be
recalled that at a meeting of the commis
sion held a month ago the salaries at all
the State asylums were cut down, the ag
gregate reduction at Stockton amounting
to $.440 per year. For example, the salary
of the medical superintendent was cut
from $291 C6 to $250, while that of his tirst
assistant was shaved down from $20S 33 to
$175 per month. Similar reductions were
ordered all down the line of employes.
The management of the Stockton asylum
to-day submitted its first salary roll since
the revised schedule was adopted. It pre
pented the claims of the mealcal superin
teudenfand his first- assistant at the old
figures. Then it proceeded to play smash
with the new schedule by advancing em
ployes whose salaries had been cut into
positions where their salaries would be as
much or more than they had been before.
The new' schedulo abolished the position
of general mechanic, salary $50 a month,
but the payroll manipulators have found
him a Jod as carpenter in the female de
partment at. JGS a month. The assistant
plumber, whose salary was cut, has been
promoted to plumber in the female de
partment at restored income. The gar
dener, whose salary of $35 had been cut to
$30 by the recent master stroke of econ
omy, has found a new job as orchardiÃt
at $45 a month, although it is declared
that there is no orchard at Stockton for
him to look after. ?..!:
The vegetable gardener, who under the
new schedule was to receive $35 per month,
puts in a claim for $45 as some other func
tionary, and a summing up of the payroll
aa presented to-day shows that it seeks to
expend at Stockton $305 per month more
than was contemplated by the new
schedule.
The commission 13. resolved that if the
medical superintendent and his assistants
want their pay at the old rate they must
sue for it. Action will doubless be taken
to upset the promotions made by the man
agement aa a subterfuge for insuring a
return to the original salaries. '.-;; >.Â¦;.-.

CIVIL SUIT FILED
AGAINST SWEIGERT
Mrs. Schmoll Charges Him With
Embezzling Money Belonging
to the Heirs.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 3.â Another move was
made, to-day by Mrs. Carotine Schmoll
and other heirs of the late Adam Swelgert
to prevent Jonathan Swelgert from acting
as executor of his father's estate.* Last
Friday an opposition to him was filed by
Caroline Sweigert, a grandchild of testa
tor, which made sensational charges of
embezzlement and attacked his Integrity.
This time the move is in the shape of a
civil suit and attachments by Mrs. Caro
line Schmoll, for herself and also as as
signee of four ' children of a deceased
brother; The action was commenced in
San Mateo County, and to-day Sheriff
Langford and his deputies were busy
muking wholesale attachments of inter
eats and property of Jonathan Swelgert.
In the suit Mrs. Schmoll seeks to re
cover $12,500 alleged to be due her and-for
$12,500 more. a? assignee of Carrie, VVi}
liam. George and James Sweigert. chil
dren of a deceased brother. It is claimed
these amounts have been due the plain
tiffs since December 29 last and are sums
collected by Jonathan Swelgert for them
but never turned over.
The Interests of Jonathan Swelgert In
nropertv at First and St. John streets,
\Vest San â¢ Fernando, near First, Second
and Julian streets, and six lots in Cook
and Branham Addition, this city, have
been attached, also the Sweigert estate
property in San Francisco and $37,000 cash
in the bank.'- â¢ , .
In the opposition, presented against
Jonathan Sweigert being granted letters
of administration on his fathers estate
he Is charged with having appropriated
J25.000 collected as rents and profits of the
estate to his own use and also with re
taining $70,000 received for sale of a build
ing belonging to his father, and the suit
fild in San Xlateo is evidently based on
these transactions.
The fight oVer the administration of the
Adam Sweigert estate will be a long one
and the nearly half million estate of the
old pioneer will shrink considerably before
the attorneys are through with it. â¢

JUDGE OGDEN'S
HOLD-UPS WERE
BOYS ON A LARK
They Shouted "Merry
Christmas."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. 90S Broadway. Jan. 3.
The "hold-up" of Superior Judge F. B."
Ogden on Christmas eve has been a sub
ject of gleeful Jibe notwithstanding seri
ous police Investigation since his Honor
reported that two men with revolvers had
tried to stop and rob him.
Xow it seems that Judge Ogden was not
held up at all and that the highwaymen
with revolvers and masks were, only three
boys on their way home after a Christmas
eve celebration. The robbers who wanted
eitheY the money or the life of the Judge
were largely creatures of his imagina
tion.
When the case was reported to the
police searching parties were sent out in
every direction and the neighborhood,
which is well populated, was thoroughly
searched. As a result of the search two
tramps were captured near San Pablo
avenue and three boys were found about
two blocks below the convent.- These boys
told stories that showed conclusively that
Judge Og-den had mistaken them for rob
bers.
Filled with the spirit of the holiday
they determined to surprise the lone rider
whom they saw approaching. When op
posite the convent they met the man in
the buggy and with wild shout they
wished htm a midnight "Merry Christ
mas." There was some waiving of arms
and acrobatic efforts that startled Judge
Ogden from his probable reverie as to
whether or not a man should be per
mitted to remain out late at nights. .
"We saw the man hit the horse a lick
and drive on hard, and after a little while
he came back with a policeman in the
buggy and began to look around," ex
plained the boys to the police.
This is Just what the Judge did and it
Is now becoming known that Judge Og
den's stand-up was merely the boisterous
Jest of some boyish revelers, who suc
ceeded only too well in trying to startle
their victim.
"I do not want to say that Judge Ogrden
is not right," said Chief of Police Hodg
kins, ll but our men found three young
fellows who admit having acted just about
as Judge Ogden said the highwaymen

may have been mistaken, though I do not
say that this is so."
SAID "KNOCKERS,"
AND A SINGERS'
WAR WAS ON
Oldest Church Choir
in Disruption.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 3.
Because of a remark about "knockers,"
which was casually dropped by a choir
member of one of the leading churches In
Oakland, a singers' war has been Inaugur
ated that may end In the disruption of
the First Presbyterian Church choirâ one
of the oldest organizations of its' kind in
Oakland.
The trouble arose over a most trivial
matter, yet, as a result, Benjamin Clark,
for twelve years choirmaster r.t the First
Presbyterian Church, was asked for and
tendered his resignation which was
pronlptly accepted. Moreover, two other
prominent members of both church and
choir have also resigned, an<i the church
trustees have been taxed to their utmost
to keep the affair from reaching the mem
bers of the congregation and the gencril
public. Where the war will end is a mat
ter of darkest conjecture.
The innocent cause of the crash is Miss
Grace Hipkins, daughter of Dr. Henry
Hlpklns of this city. It appears, from all
accounts, that Mlbs Hipkins had been in
troduced to Choirmaster Clark by Miss
Aimee Mervy as a young lady possessed
of a sweet contralto voice and an ambi
tion to attain distinction in the world of
music. The question of Miss Hlpklns'
qualifications as a candidate for member
ship in the choir was based by the choir
master upon the condition that her Voice
prove satisfactory. On the following Sat
urday evening the young lady's voice was
to have been tested, but she failed to keep
the appointment. Her absence was men
tioned the next day at a meeting of the
quartet of the church choir, consisting cf
Mrs. J. Alexander Campbell, Mrs. Carrie
Brown-Dexter, Ben Clark and i Clement
Rowlands. An intimation that Miss Hlp
klns Â¦ had been dissuaded from attending
rehearsal by Mrs. Dexter met with an ad
mission. Then the expression "that thÂ»re
are evidently knockers in the choir" fell
from the lips of Choirmaster Clark.
The effect was like that of a thunder
clap from a clear sky. Mr. Clark was
asked "if he was personal in his re
marks." His answer that "if the cap f.ts,
it can be worn," brought on the storm
full raging. Mrs. Dexter and Mr. Row
lands, taking exception to the remark*,
immediately tendered their resignations
and on the following Sunday Mr. Clark
was called to dance on the carpet before
the trustees. He admitted having referred
to "knockers" and "the cap that fits."
and his resignation was asked and
promptly tendered. â¢Â¦'-.'Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ :.- ;
Miss Hlpklns, who was entirely Inrts
cent in the matter, expresses her sorrow
that such a stormy singers' war should
have followed her failure to keep an ap
pointment. Mrs. Carrie Brown-Dexter
shuddered at the thought of making the
whole affair public, yet she volunteered
the information that she "considered Mr.
Clark's remarks in the nature of an In
sult." She declares she had no words
with Mr. Clark, but that there was a trial
and a full statement before the trustees.
HAS SAVED MANY LIVES.
DELANOY AGAIN
THREATENED BY
LETTER-WRITER
The Given Name of
Suspect Disclosed.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 3.â Another anony
mous letter was received to-day by F. N.
Delanoy. The missive this time bears
the postmark of San Francisco. There
was no handwriting. The envelope con
tained only a published picture of Mr.
Delanoy at the bottom of which were ihe
printed words in large black type, "Weak
and puny man, beware." â¢
In a letter published this afternoon, De
lanoy discloses the given name of the per
son whom he suspects. He addresses iilm
familiarly as Georgle. The nameless pen
man, Delanoy insists, Is well known in
Alameda. He knows no motive for the
attacks, as the suspect has never had any
difnculty with him.
The paper on which the first letter was
written furnishes Delanoy with his clew
to the identity of the suspect. It Is the
kind of wrapping paper which usually en
folds blank newspaper. Delanoy was for
merly in the paper business in San Fran
cisco. The suspect is himself in the paper
business, and it is through this fact that
he is able to trace a direct connection be
tween the man and the stationery used to
threaten him with. .-.-..
In addition to the letter to the public
Delanoy gives voluntary indorsements
from a number of his friends. They read:
A scoundrel beneath contempt.
W. W. HASKEL.U
A cur that should be kicked out of the com
munity. F. K. KRAUTH.
Chief of Fire Department. '
The anonymous letters are contemptible. I
can hardly think (hat any citizen of Alameda
is so degraded. Hunt him down.
GEORGE H. BEW.
Those letters are from some scamp who will
surely receive the treatment that he deserves.
I hope you will nail him. H. Q. EIMER.
Could not come from a man. but from a
cur and coward of the worst type.
GEORGE REXNER.
The anonymous letters are scandalous, and
must come from the brain of wme degenerate,
whose proper place is San Quentln.
E. J>. JL'DD.
When detected he must take any punishment
given him, as he has no defense.
JOSEPH MESSER.
The anonymous letters you have shown roe,
like all communications of their kind, emanate
from some cowardly cur. I hope you will ex
pose the author so that we can treat him with
the conterout he deserves.

THE S AX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 4, 1900.
OF INTEREST
TO THE COAST
Groff for Postmaster of
Los Angeles.
Special Ditratch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3.â Representative
Waters reeommeridf-d to-day for Post
master at Los Angeles Judge Lewis A.
Groff. He was formerly Commissioner
of the General Land Office under Presi
dent Harrison, and his record as such
â¢was one of the best ever made in that
department. Judge Groff Is a well-known
lawyer in Southern California and Mr.
Waters feels that his Fflectioo will meet
with- the approval of a great majority of
the ptople of Los Angeles. Among the
other applicant? were Molt Flint, John
Koster (brother-in-law of Speaker Hen
derson), Charles A. Toll, F. J. Cressey,
J. H. Ehoulter? and Perry W. Ross.
The Poftofflce Department to-day
established the office of cashier for the
Los Angeles po?tofiice. Â¦ Since his arrival
in Washingv>n Congressman Waters has
been laboring to bring this about and
finally ha* succored in convincing the
Postmaster General of its necessity.
When It is known that no more than
fifteen or twenty cities in the United
States are consider^ of enough impor
tance to maintain this office, its estab
lishment in Los Ar.ftlts may be con
sidered a great trtoapfa and a full recog
nition of the iTjmnu rcial importance of
the city. The salary is from 11500 to
tOOQ. and Mr. â¢ Waters will recommend a
man for the place to-morrow.
The California delegation will in the
future have weekly conferences upon
legislative n-iatters pertaining to Cali
fornia. It will probably select Repre
sentative Loud, who is the oldest member
In point of service and has the confluence
of all of his colleagues, as chairman. '
Representative Metcalf will be chosen
secretary. Representative de Vries, al
though a Democrat, will be asked to pur-.
tldpate in the proceedings.
The following California bills were in
troduced to-day:
By Senator Perkinsâ Providing for the mire
rr.ea of officer* and rnea of the lisrhtlio'j*e and
SOCIETY MAN
ARRESTED BY
IRATE TAILOR
Hiller Allen Is "De
Â¦;Â£ tamed."
Hiller Allen, stepson of J. M. Costlgan.
the prominent wool merchant, and well
known in Oakland society, is at outs with,
his tailor and is also languishing In dur
ance vile by reason of his inability to
make good for a suit of clothes be ob
tained.
He was taken into custody In Oakland
late last night by Arthur H. Williams of
the firm of Williams Bros., tailors, at It
Sutter street, and his aristocratic name
was entered on the "small book" at tha
City Prison.
Some weeks "ago Allen clothed hl3
graceful form in natty raiment and
posed as one of the local swells. He fell
from grace last night while walking past
the City Hall. Young Williams visited
the Athenian city last night for the pur
pose of coming to an understanding with
his customer, and when he saw Allen
near the City Hall, Williams accosted,
him and invited him to step into the
Chiefs office to explain the transaction
over the suit of clothes.
AU>n was unable to explain the matter
satisfactorily to those vitally interested.
and his name was entered on the detenue
book and he .was held until Williams could
swear to a warrant for his arrest. â¢
It is said that Allen gave a piece of pa
per In lieu of money as consideration for
the clothes. After he had left the store it
was found that the note or check was
worthless, and Williams Brothers, dislik
ing to cause such an Illustrious person
trouble, wrote him that $50 was due them
for the garments.
Youns Allen overlooked the epistle, and
as a result the tailors decided to take
summary action. The consequence was
that Allen and his clothes were locked up
for the night. It is probable that he will
be charged to-day with having obtained
money on false pretenses.

11POLICE WILL RISK IT.
Consternation was manifested yester
day among the police who are eligible for
retirement on the pension list, as tHey
had been requested to call at 11 o'clock
at Police Headquarters. They felt satis
fled that' they were .to be asked to send
in their resignations, and they did not
relish the outlook. They were not asked
to resign, but were offered tho privilege
of so doing. 'It was pointed out to them
that they could now retire without any
trouble, as they had served the twenty
years and were over 60 years of age, but
the new charter provided that they must
be 65 years of age, and it was an open
question whether or not the new rule
would apply to them. They. all, as one
man. said they would not send in their
resignations and would take their
chances.

sianers met at the Mayor's office yester
day to determine by lottery their respec
tive term of office.
Jeremiah Deasy and Oliver Everett each
won a four-year, prize. Sheldon Q. Kel
logg was the winner of a three-year term.
M. Greenblatt, who deserved better luck,
got the two-year term. A. W. Voor
sanger took the one-year package, and
will doubtless be ready to serve the public
again before Mayor Phelan's administra
tion ends.
On Saturday morning the Election Com
missioners will meet in the Registrar's
office and will perfect their organization.
A keen tight is being made for the secre
taryship, the leading candidates being
Lawrence Welch. T. J. Walsh and D. I.
Gordon. , .
The new Police Commissioners-elect
met last evening informally at the office
of Dr. W. F. McNutt. 1220 Sutter street,
on the request of Mayor Phelan that they
draw lots to determine the duration of
their respective terms of office. The four
Commissioners-electâ W. J. Biggy, W. F.
McNutt, George A. Newhall and William
Thomasâ were present.
At the representation of Mr. Thomas it
was decided that he and his colleagues
were only private citizens until they had
duly qualified and as such had no right
to cast lots for the duration of their re
spective terms. Action was accordingly
deferred until Monday next.
The point raised by Mr. Thomas, was
presented to the new Park Commission
ers yesterday afternoon and Reuben H.
Lloyd, one of the oldest and best lawyers
In the city, attached very little Importance
to it.
Mr. Thomas may be surprised to learn
that he will still be a private citizen after
he takes his oath of office. He will not
attain to the solemn dignity and pro

that period is to be determined by the

for his client, but Judge Tobin seemed to
feel that Rice had done wrong In not put
ting on his coat when he left his house
to chastise Kane, and had not acted as an
officer should. <
Policeman Boukofsky was brought be
fore the board for being intoxicated wnile
on duty. Sergeant Mahoney was the com
plaining witness and he testified how
Boukofsky had fallen down the steps
while in an inebriated condition. Bou
kofsky in his own behalf said that he had
been on duty at the polls for nine nours
without being relieved and was taken sick
and a drug clerk prescribed whiskey for
him and this affected him, and while go-
Ing up stairs to change his uniform he
stubbed his toe against an iron plate
tripped and fell down the stairs. Captain
Wlttman said that Boukofsky was a good
officer and had never been reported for
dereliction of duty. Sergeant Mahoney
seemed anxious to make a strong case
against the unfortunate policeman and
added other damaging facts to his testi
mony. Commissioner Tobin Instructed
Captain Wittman to substitute rubber for
the material now in use on the station
steps. â¢
Officer Callahan was tried for the same
offense and was given a severe reprimand
by President Tobin. Callahan's captain
and sergeants paid him a high compli
ment as an officer and this fact mitlsattd
his offense.
Policeman Phelan was the most unfor
tunate of the lot. He was charged with
neglect of duty because he did not pay at
tention to incoherent statements made to
him by Antoine Aschsletter that a man
who murdered his wife was in a saloon on
Phelan'a beat.- For failure to Investigate
the matter Phelan was mulcted a month's
salary, but had the satisfaction of hear
ing Captain Splllane say that' he was nn
honest policeman and attended strictly to
business.
The case of Special Officer Herman Hot

INFLICTED HEAVY FINES

last evening. Officer John Phelan was
fined $100 for'neglect of duty, William E.

CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSIONERS
Two Obliged to Resign' Office in. the
Merchants' Association. . i
All the directors of the Merchants' As
sociation were present at the special,
meeting yesterday to take action upon
the cases of two of the directors. Mayor
I'helan appointed Director Watt upon the
Fire Commission and Director Quinn upon
the Civil Service Commission. As it has
always been the unwritten law of the
Merchants' Association that. none of its
directors shall occupy a public office
while serving upon the board, Directors
Watt and Quinn very reluctantly sent In
their resignations from the board of
directors. As it waa deemed advisable to
retain the precedent so long sustained in
the administration of the association, the
board with great regret decided to accept
the resignations of these two directors.
Regarding the appointment of Secretary
Freud as a Civil Service Commissioner, it
was deemed consistent with the policy of
the association to permit Mr. Freud to act
In that capacity, as the secretary has no
vote in the board of directors.
A resolution was unanimously adopted
that Secretary Freud be permitted to ac
cept the appointment as Civil Service
Commissioner as tendered to him by
Mayor Phelan and retain his present posi
tion as secretary of the association, be
ing allowed to devote sufficient time to
the duties and requirements of the Civil
Service Commission. The board also de
cided to lend its assistance In every way
to the successful introduction and estab
lishment of the civil service system in
this city according to the provisions of
the new charter.

CUSTODIAN NEARLY FOLLOWS
VIOLENT LURCH OF THE NEW
PORT CAUSED THE LOSS.
The southeaster of Tuesday morning
last proved disastrous to one man on the
water front. It will cost him a well
earned position and entails a loss of about
$1000 on the Pacific Mail Company.
The Mail Company's steamer Newport
came back from Manila about ten days
ago and Monday, last was returned to her
owners by the Government. While the
vessel was In the Central American trade,
J. Howland acted as storekeeper, but as
soon. as she was chartered by the Govern
ment as .a transport the regular purser
was put on the waiting list and Howland
was made to do the duty of purser and
storekeeper for one man's salary. During
the voyage " he disbursed all the ship's
money and on his return had to give an
accounting of his stewardship, as a mat
ter of course.
Unfortunately for him, Howland had to
square' his accounts the morning of the
southeaster. The Newport had been
moved to the Mail Dock, and he started;
ashore when the^ealewas at its worst.
Tho ship's cash on hand, about. $1500 all
told,. was In three sacks. â¢ Howland carried
two of these and a quartermaster the
third. While both men were on the gang
plank the steamer gave a violent plunge
and Howland was nearly â¢thrown over
board. To save 'himself he dropped tho
bags of money and grasped the ropes of
tho companion-way. Even then he, would
have fallen between the ship and' the
wharf had noftho quartermaster dropped
his sack of money and pulled him to a
place of safety.
The money was gone and all there was
for Howland to do was to make a report
of the loss. Yesterday morning a diver
was set to work and he recovered one of
the bags. It was securely tied, but when
opened there was only silver money found
in it. The valuable bag of twenty-dollar
gold pieces was still missing and tho
search was continued. Finally an empty
coin sack was found. The fastening was
gone and not a trace of the contents could
be found. A dredger was then put at
work- and all It brought up was mud. In
which there were no twenty-dollar gold
pieces. The search ;â¢ for the money . has
cost the Mail Company more than $100.
The search will be continued to-day.
Purser Howland Is a great favorite In
the Mail Company's service, and every
body feels sorry for the mishap that is
likely to cost him so dear.

The newly appointed Election Commis-
CRAZED with liquor and laboring under the hallu
cination that the road back to town lay across the
Pacific Ocean, a young man said to be William Mc-
Donald, a collector for Baldwin & Howell, drove his
rig yesterday afternoon Into the surf at a point about mid
jvay between the Olympic Club pier and the Cliff House,
"urging the horse out until an unusually large roller swept
the frightened animal from its feet, nearly overturned the
buggy and half drowned its frenzied occupant. McDon
ald was pitched from his seat and barely saved himself
from being carried out to sea by grasping the seat of the
floating vehicle. He was nearly smothered by the waves,
as It was, and surely would have drowned but for the
timely arrival of assistance from the- shore.
Jack O'Brien of Philadelphia, who is matched to fight
with Al Neill at Woodward's Pavilion to-morrow night,
and Jack Edwards, who is training Phil Green for his con
test with Fred Ast on the same date, were the heroes of the
occasion. O'Brien and Edwards were standing on the ver
anda of the Seal Rock House a few minutes after 4
o'clock when their attention was attracted by McDonald's
efforts to force his horse into the surf. The animal appre
ciated the danger and twice bolted back to the shore.
On the third trial McDonald succeeded in forcing the
horse several hundred feet from the shore. The tide was
out and the water only came up to the animal's breast.
The rig had approached to within fifty feet of the end
of the pier when O'Brien, who had been watching the
outfit through a field glass, suddenly exclaimed:
"Look there; something Is wrong."
Horse and Reckless Driver Nearly Swept Away at Ocean Beach.
He had scarcely spoken when the horse disappeared
from view to reappear a moment later floundering wildly
toward the shore and dragging the nearly capsized buggy.
McDonald appeared to be caught In the wheels. O'Brien
dropped the glass and started on a run to the rescue, close
ly followed by Edwards. Alternately swimming and
wading they soon reached the buggy and found McDonald
hanging half in and half out of the vehicle nearly uncon
scious, but holding onto the seat with a deathlike grip. By
almost superhuman efforts they succeeded In quieting the
horse and getting McDonald clear of the rig. By this time
Jack Monroe, O'Brien's trainer, arrived, and between the
three the whole outfit was brought ashore. McDonald had
swallowed a large amount of salt water and it required
vigorous work for a few minutes to bring him around.
McDonald is a smooth-shaven young fellow and weighs
about 120 pounds, but when the salt water had been
squeezed out of him and he had partially regained his
senses he was unable to appreciate the fact that he had
Just been rescued from almost certain death and wanted to
fight everybody in sight. One of the crowd that witnessed
the rescue recognized him and finally put him in his buggy
and drove back to town with him. The affair was witnessed
by fifty people, a number of whom were at the water's
edge when a tragedy seemed impending, but they were ap
parently too dazed to attempt a rescue.
When O'Brien and Edwards came to town last nleht
they found that the. story of their gallant deed had pre
ceded them and they were congratulated for their hero
ism all along the line.

Telephone Ordinance Adopted
on Lines Laid Down by Lane.
Car Turntables Declared Nuisances and
Ordered Removed From the Streets.
Routine Work Completed.
Â£^-=> T the regular meeting of the Board j
if U of Supervisors yesterday after
jL â \\ n<>on Mayor Phrlan read his veto
ll Wof Supervisor Algeltfnger's origl
nal telephone ordinance. In his j
message his Honor gave as his reason for
objection that City and County Attorney
Lane had. in an official opinion, declared
the ordinance as presented Illegal, and he
thought it would be a waste of time and
money to act further upon it and risk the
chance of legal contest. Although the
Mayor read his veto only yesterday its
purport was known nearly a week ago.
At that Umo it was published in the news
papers and the Mayor ihen promised to
bring to the board an ordinance which he
declared would be drawn upon legal lints.
as laid down by the Supervisors' official
advisor.
Despite the apparent sincerity of .Mr. j
Phelan's promises the majority in the ;
board had not the greatest faith. The
Mayor's opposition to the original resolu
tion and his evident desire to postpone any I
action upon it had been too plain and they
feared that hia plan was to gain to the
next board the honor of offering and pass
ing a resolution which would end. once
and for all. one of the greatest imposi
tions inflicted upon the people under the
present form ot government. s "PÂ« r *Â£^
Aigeltinger at once sought the best legal
advice in the city and had Prs? ared h a^Vt;
dinance along the lines laid down b> Cltj
and County Attorney Lane. It was sucn
en ordinance as the Mayor himself would
have presented had he carried out the let
ter of his promise, and according to the
ber* legal opinion was quite within tnÂ«
Â£w: "ft differed from the original order
only in that it Imposed a. license upon i aU
telephones Instead of upon mckel-in-the
elot instruments alone, and reduced the
Quarterly tax from $1 to 5u cents ;
When it came to a "show down before
the board yesterday Mayor Phelan so far
made gooa his promise as to announce
Sit hf had hd P^pared an ordinance
which he considered would fill the re
quirements of Attorney Lane. He did not
order it read, but when it was demanded
by Supervisor Aigeltinger It developed
that no amount was fixed as a quarterly
license and when questioned on this point
Mayor Phelan attempted to carry con
sideration over to the next board by sug
pesains that it Fhould go again before tne
City and County Attorney upon that
point. Supervisor Aigeltinger disagreed
with him and insisted upon the considera
tion of his resolution, which contained
none of the Mayors omissions. The ques
tion was called and there were but two
votes in opposition. The resolution was
only passed to print and the present board
has nothing to do with Its linal passage.
However, that Is a duty for the Incoming
board and it will doubtless carry* out the
Intention of the present body and spread
the ordinance on the city's law books by
a unanimous vote. 1
Supervisor Aigeltinger's second tele
phone resolution making it a misdemeanor
for any firm or corporation carrying on a
telephone business within the city and
county to demand pay for a switch with
out having first furnished connection was
finally passed, and needs only the Mayor's
gig-nature to become law.
The much discussed turntable ordinance
also came up on final passage and went
through with seven votes. The anti-turn
table law passed to print on the 7th of
last August. It prohibited the operation
of street car turntables upon any cross
walks within the city and county and
was designed to do away with the nul
eanccs now maintained at the end of
Halght street* at Fifth and Market
streets. Post and Market and at Geary
and Market streets, by the Market-street
Hallway Company. Since its Introduction
It has been bitterly fought by that corpo
ration and its agents were present In the
board rooms yesterday, armed with every
pull, financial or otherwise, which was
calculated to convince members of the
board that the order was not good law.
Notwithstanding the tremendous press
ure which was brought to bear the board
Ftooa acain manfully to its duty. The
smooth work of the Market-street corpo
ration's agents was of little avail, so lit
t>, in fact, that so soon as opportunity
offered Supervisor Edward Kalben made
way for himself and demanded that the
resolution be taken up out of order and
given the consideration of which it had
fo long been deprived. His motion was
<luly seconded and Mayor Phelan was
forced to announce it. There were but two
votes against the suspension. Then the
vote to finally adopt the resolution came
on and It carried with but four votes in
dlFPent.
The recommendation of the Judiciary
Committee was adopted to the effect that
the ord>r providing for a reduced rate on
streetcar fares to workingmen during
certain hours of the day be indefinitely
postponed, Byington. Deasy and Perrault
voting against postponement and Lack
mar.n absent. Eylngton's amendment to
refer it to the incoming board was lost.
The second order providing for reduced
fares to school children was also in
definitely postponed by the same vote.
Uyington, who Introduced the orders,
spoke jn favor of it, saying that similar
orders were successfully operated in sev
eral other cities.
The resolution awarding the contract to
furnish title insurance on the lots in the
proposed park panhandle and Mission
park to the Calliornia Title Insurance and
Trust Company for the sum of $25,114 51
was passed to print.
The order prohibiting the driving of ve
hicles with one wheel on the outer track
and the other on the bituminous pave
ment was finally passed.
Action on the resolution- providing for
the payment of $4000 to the Park Pan
handle Commissioners was postponed to
allow the incoming board to take up its
consideration.
The Mayor's veto of the privilege
granted by the board to the San Francisco
Ilrick Company to blast in the Flint
Tract was passed to print. The reason
for the Mayor's objection was that a
similar privilege was denied without suffi
cient reason to Quimby & Harrelson, who
complain of the discrimination.
Perrault introduced an amended order
to the one originally Introduced by
Kalben. providing for the muzzling of
greyhounds when training for coursing in
the public streets. I'errault's order pro
vided for the muzzling of all dogs, and.
after some discussion that waxed humor
ous, it was indefinitely postponed.
The Market Street Railway Company
signified Its intention to erect ornamental
iron poles for the electric line on Howard
street, from its easterly terminus to
Twenty-fourth street. The Mayor direct
ed that the communication be made a
matter of record, as the board had re
cently passed a resolution allowing the
company the privilege of using temporary
wooden poles on both Howard and Tweny
fourth streets.
The National Athletic Club was granted
permission to hold a boxing contest be
tween January 1 and 15 on payment of the
usual license.
The telephone company was directed to
place an extension telephone in the pri
vate office of the superintendent of the
City and County Hospital.
The Board of Fire Commissioners was
authorized to purchase ten folding beds,
to be paid for out of the insurance con
tribution fund.
The balance of taxes paid under protest,
amounting to $512 94. was placed to the
credit of the appropriation for License
Collector's blanks, tags, etc.
The resolution allowing the sum of ?400
to the Tax Collector for extra clerks dur
ing January, ISOO, was postponed for one
w*ek.
The Superintendent of Streets was em
powered to construct a bituminous rock
sidewalk and runway in front of the
police station on Spventeenth street at a
cost not to exceed $230.
The following petitions were referred to
proper committees:
National Athletic Club, to ' give a
boxing exhibition in February; Butchers*
Board of Trade, requesting that the li
cense tax on meat peddlers, with the
per.alty attached, be maintained under the
new charter.
The board adjourned to meet to-morrow
at 2 p. m., when all its official affairs will
be wound up.
WAIT OF DEEP DISTRESS
AND CRY OF VENGEANCE
Democrats of the Rank and File
Ignored by Mayor Phelan.
Seven High Places Given to the Aristocrats
of the Pacific Union Clubâ An Eagle
Eye on Police Contingent Fund.
THERE is a wall of disappointment
in every club of the unwashed
"south of the slot." Mingled with
the wails of Democratic distress 13
a cry of political vengeance. The
agony In the camp of the young workers
in the Democratic party is caused by
Mayor Phelan's turn down of the rank
and file. In the Twenty-eighth and Twen
ty-ninth the remark is heard on all sides,
"This is Mayor Phelan's finish."
A Democratic leader keen of perception
and sharp of tongue likened the struggle
to a wrestling tournament. The arena
was the Mayor's office and the wrestlers
were the Pacific-Union Club aristocracy
and the south of Market street Democ
racy. There were seven falls and the Pa
cific-Union was the winner In every bout.
The successful gladiators of the club were
James Denman, Dr. W. E. Hopkins.
George A. Newhall, Reuben H. Lloyd.
A. B. Spreckels. Dr. McNutt and F. W.
Zelle. Not a fall was given to the wres
tlers hailing from the region south of
the list, a facetious Demo
crat ejaculated: "I Judge from these ap
pointments that Jlmmie is trying to get
Into society." A Democratic leader who
was sizing up the Police Commission to a
group of interested listeners remarked, as
he named one member: "He is the boss
donkey of San Francisco Do you know
that he hesitates to visit Golden Gate
Park for fear the children will ride him?
Interesting stories are told in political
circles of the indignation meeting of the
Mahoneys. One story goes that p. I. Ma
honey was on the Police Commission for
a day, but the pressure to put on Mr.
Blggy was so great that the Mayor cast
Mahoney aside. Then the Indignant Ma

RUEF CHARGED DOOLAN
WITH AIDING SHEEHAN
TAX COLLECTOR'S CONTEST BE
COMING INTERESTING.
Defeated Democratic Candidate Now
Says That He Would Not Take
the Office as a Gift.
"Dick" Doolan, late Democratic candi
date for the office of Tax Collector, spent
a bad half hour yesterday on the witness
stand during the hearing of the Sheehan-
Scott contest before Judge Seawell. Doo
lan was called as a witness on behalf of
the contestant, as he had a knowledge
gleaned from books and papers in San
Jose of Scott's prior residence. When he
was handed over to A. Ruef, who repre
sents Scott, the difficulty began.
"Is it not a fact," said Ruef, "that you
and Sheehan put up a Job to stand to
gether and defeat Scott?"
"No," answered the witness, "emphati
Â°*'ls It not a fact that you are standing
with Sheehan in this contest for the
purpose of ousting Scott with the belief
that you may be appointed to fill the
vacancy if one is made."
"No," again answered Doolan." I would
r.ot take the office as a gift."
"Well, that is good." added Ruef, "for
you won't get the chance."
Garret McEnerney, who represents the
contestant, objected to Ruef s remarks,
whereupon Ruef said that he was only
jesting. This ended the incident.
A. A. Brown took the stand and testified
that Scott resided in San Jose up to the
year 1595. Joseph P. Scott identified
some letters written by the Tax Collec
tor-elect from San Jose. Sheehan gave
evidence as to his eligibility to hold the
office he seeks to retain, and Oscar Curtaz
said that Mr. Scott had been a resident
of this city since July, 1594.
Mrs. Scott, wife of the defendant in the
action, was the last witness called during
the session. She said that her husband
and herself broke up housekeeping in San
Jose in July of ISO 4 and came to this city
to reside with her husband's parents until
they could secure another home. She
also testified that for some time prior to
that time they had decided to come to this
city, and although Mr. Scott frequenly
went to San Jose on business after they
moved here, he considered, as did she,
that this city was his permanent and only
residence place. The contest goes on again
to-day.
brother-in-law, was apprised of the gath

was shocked at the violent demonstrations
of Sullivan in hla haste to inform thÂ»
Mayor that the Mahoneys were out for
vengeance. PheJan trembled, but. recov
ering composure, sought to change things
around to make a place for Dennis Ma

adjustment was accomplished by leaving
off Downey Harvey.
The contest for Chief of Police Is ren
dered doubly interesting on account of tha
contingent fund. A political leader, who
has the reputation of knowing the lnslrto
of deals, asserts that there 13 an eagle
eye on the $10,000 per annum which the
Chief is authorized to disburse without
explanation. Here is what the new char
ter provides:
Section 6. The Chief of Police may
from time to time disburse such sums
for contingent expenses of the de
partment as in his judgment shall ba
for the best interest o.f the city and
county, to be paid out ox the contin
gent fund allowed by the depart
ment. The aggregate of all such
sums shall not in any one fiscal year
exceed the sum of ten thousand dol
lars. Provision shall be made by th.9
Supervisors for such contingent fund
in the annual tax levy. The Commis
sioners shall allow and order paid out
of such contingent fund as contin
gent expenses of the Police Depart
ment, upon orders signed by the
Chief of Police, such amounts as may
be required.
"Do not run away with the notion that
the contingent fund â¢will escape the cun
ning observation of one member of th*
Police Commission." continued the saga
clous exponent of Democratic reform
principles.
