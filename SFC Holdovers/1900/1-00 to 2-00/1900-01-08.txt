only to find the Boers massed in

enough to attack Ladysmith and
hold Buller in check at the same
time.
Some fighting was begun by
General Clery near Colenso
bridge on Saturday at about 5
o'clock, since which time no dis
patches have come through.
General White's position at
Ladysmith is clearly very criti
cal and it is not an exaggeration
to say that the British public
must prepare itself for the possi
bility of receiving news of the
most serious disaster of 'the war.
The latest message from White
himself is dated at a quarter-past
3 p. m. on Saturday. At that time
he was very hard pressed, to
quote his own words. Communi
cations from Ladysmith are re
ceived, it will be remembered, by
heliograph and at a critical point
the sun failed and General Buller
had absolutely no news to send.
He adds, however, a camp rumor
to the effect that at 5 o'clock
General White defeated . the
Boers, taking four hundred pris
ers. Presumably General Buller
would hardly have transmitted
this message unless he had some
reason for thinking there was
truth in it. Still it does not pro
fess to be anything more than a
rumor and General Buller ex
pressly says that he has no real
news.
The serious tone in all of
White's messages is very signifi
cant. According to the War Of

prisoners, including seven officers.
The War Office publishes the following dispatch from General Forestier-Walker, commanding at Cape Town:
"Genera! French reports under date of January 6:
v 'The situation is much the same as yesterday, but I regret to report that a serious accident has happened to the First
Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment/
"From news just come to hand from them I gather that, with the authority and with the knowledge of General French,
four companies of the First Battalion advanced by night against a low hill one mile from their camp. They attacked at dawn,
lieutenant Colonel Watson, commanding, gave orders to charge. He was at once wounded.
"Orders for retirement were given. Three-quarters of the force retreated to camp. The remainder held their ground until
they were overpowered by greater numbers, when they surrendered. Seventy were taken prisoners, including seven officers.
"General French reports that the Boer commando which made the attack on January 4 lost fifty kilted, besides wounded
and prisoners. The commando was dispersed."
General Buller has wired the War Office the following, dated January 6, from Frere Camp:
"The following message was received from General White at 1 p. m. to-day:
" 'January 6, 1 1 a. m.â Attack continues and enemy has been reinforced from the south/

"I have absolutely no more news, and there is no sun. There is a camp rumor that White defeated the enemy at 5- this

persistent rumors that a coup of some

BOMBARDMENT OF
LADYSMITH FROM
EVERY QUARTER
Musketry Fire Mingles With
Cannons' Roar, Indicating
Heavy Fighting.
LONDON, Jan. B.â The Daily Mall has
the following dated January 6, at noon,
from "Frere Camp:
"At 8 o'clock this morning very heavy
firing' began at Ladysmith. It lasted
fully four hours, and must have meant
either a sortie by the British or a de
termined attack on the garrison by the
Boers: 'Our shells could be seen falling
on Umbulwhna Hill and the enemy were
replying.
"Besides the cannon reports, there were
sounds Indicating , smaller pieces of ar
tillery In action. The fighting iriust have
been at closer range than has been the
case up to now.
"Our. naval guns at Chleveley sent their
usual fire Into the Boer trenches, but
there has been 'no further movement
hero!". ,' '. . .
Another dispatch to the Dally Mall from
Frere Camp says:
"Saturday's bombardment of Ladysmith
was the heaviest yet recorded. All the
heavy guns were working and the Boers
seemed to be pouring in shells from every
available lighter gun."
The Daily Telegram has the following
from Frere Camp, dated January 6:
"A very heavy ' bombardment went on
at Ladysmith from daybreak until 8 this
morning. It is believed that an action was
In progress, for musketry fire also was
heard. It is possible the garrison was
making a sortie, for the Boers at Colenso
hurriedly left their trenches and rode to
ward Ladysmith.
"Our big naval gun at Chleveley Camp
fired several rounds at the enemy as they
were leaving their Colenso lines. General
Buller has ridden on to Chleveley with his
staff."
A special dispatch from Frere Camp,
dated Saturday, January 6, says:
"General White heliographs that he de
feated the Boers this morning. They crept
up so close to the defending forces that
the Gordon Highlanders and the Man
chesters actually repulsed them at the
point of the bayonet."
EJECTION OF BRITISH
FROM THE TRANSVAAL
CAPE TOWN, Jan. 6.â An ammunition
column started for tho front to-day. Sev
eral colonial Irregulars of Dutch extrac
tion have been brought here under ar
rest.
The Cape Argus learns from Pretoria
that fifty British subjects in Pretoria and
Johannesburg have received " their pass-
ately for . its life, with ' another
larger army fifteen miles to the
south powerless to move to its
relief.
The scene of the first attack by
the Boers upon General White's
lines is important, as it shows
that the enemy was following a
well defined plan.
Below Joubert, on the Tugela;
is Buller's army, which numbers
about 33,000 men. Within Lady
smith Camp there are at least
8000, while the Boers number
25,000. or. 30,000 men.
On the south of Ladysmith
there is a strong fortified position
called Caesar's Camp; standing a
little detached from the main cir
cle of ; intrenchments. This was
the objective of the Boer assault,
which was ; delivered . >vith - such
boldness that the Gordon High
landers; and Manchesters had to
drive. back the foe at the point
of the bayonet.
It was part of the Boer policy
to overpower if possible this iso
lated position, not. only because
there would thus be gained an
elevation from which to threat
en the more closely beleaguered
garrison, but because a force
would then be interposed be
tween White's sortie and Buller's
advance.
Some of the Boers left the
trenches at Colenso and galloped
up to help their comrades fur
ther north in the attack, the
movement being obviously a
concerted one, but, as stated be
fore, General Bailer found the
trenches in front of him fully oc
cupied.
Another significant fact is that
the Boers have overcome their
dislike for cold steel.

THE LATE REV. EDWARD McGLYNN.
NEWBURGH. N. V.. Jan. 7.â Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn. rector of St.
Mary's Church, died at the rectory at 6:20 o'clock this afternoon, after
an Illness of about seven weeks. Death was due to heart failure
superinduced by Bright's disease.
A minor surgical operation was performed on Dr. McGlynn last night,
but this did not affect the patient or contribute materially to his death. During
the night Dr. McGlynn had several sinking spells, and the physicians were called
early to his beside where they remained until he died. As early as noon it had
become apparent that the end was near, and Dr. McGlynn received holy oom
raur.lon from the assistant rector of St. Mary's, who later administered extreme
unction. After high mass in the morning Dr. McGlynn was anointed.
All efforts toward prolonging life were made by the physicians, but at 4
o'clock the priest lapsed Into unconsciousness, his last audible prayer being
"Jesus, have mercy on me."
He passed away without recovering consciousness.
For two days past Dr. McGlynn had been troubled with hiccoughs, but was
able to take liquid nourishment to the last. Dr. McGlynn was aware that death
was near, receiving the word tranquilly.
This morning telegrams were sent to Dr. McGlynn's nephews and niece In
Brooklyn and several Catholic clergymen, his warm friends, were notified. A
dispatch was sent to Archbishop Corrigan and his secretary telegraphed:
"His Grace will arrive In Newburgh at S:10."
Archbishop Corrigan had already made arrangements to visit Dr. McGlynn and
would have come on Monday. The relatives missed a train and did not arrive
until Dr. McGlynn had become unconscious. Efforts were made to locate Frank
McGlynn, the actor, a son of Dr. McGlynn's brother, who lives In California.
Archbishop Cprrlgan arrived at S:10 and proceeded at once to St. Mary's reo
tory. He expressed deep regret that he had not arrived before the end came.
He was much moved when he entered the chamber of death and looked on the
face of the dead, and commented sadly on the dead priest's appearance. -He
Unelt with the other clergy and said prayers.
The cheerfulness that characterized Dr. McGlynn was exhibited to the last.
Even when the physicians were using salt water to keep him alive a few hours
longer. Dr. McGlynn evinced much interest and finally remarked: "Well, the
ways of physicians are wonderful."
The citizens of Newburgh were preparing a testimonial for Dr. McGlynn,
â¢who celebrated his first mass In St. Mary's Church on New Year's day, 1595, and
who ha/ been In the ministry for forty years. People of all denominations were
to hav^ united In honoring the priest and a purse was to have been presented to
him. News of Dr. McGlynn's death caused profound sorrow. Prayers had
been offered In both Protestant and Catholic churches for his recovery.
Dr. McGlynn was first stricken with Illness on November 18 at the rectory.
He was seized with a severe cold and was compelled to seek his bed. Though he
was obliged to break engagements to lecture, no alarm was felt by his friends
until the following Monday, when he suffered a severe chill. The first serious
attack occurred November 26, and a day or two later there was a consulta
tion of physicians. It was announced that Dr. McGlynn was Buffering from
chronic kidney disease.
Eariy In December Dr. MeGlynn (suffered two attacks of 'heart failure and
h!Â» relatives were hurriedly summoned. He rallied, however, and until Satur
day night he appeared to be holding his own and gradually regained his
etrer.gth. He was able to sit by his bedside for a few minutes each day, but was
never able to leave his room.
Dr. MeGlynn was 62 years of age last September. When he was stricken he
was robust and of fine physique, but he became greatly emaciated by his long
Illness.
Father Edward McGlj-nn was born in New York City on September 27, 1537.
After having studied eight years especially for the priesthood, he was ordained
on March 25. ISGO. and assigned to St. Stephen's Church. New York, as rector. In
1562 he was promoted to the rectorship of St. Ann's, but before a year had
clapeed was asked by Archbishop Hughes to resign, for the reason that the Arch
bishop desired to transfer his chancellor to the position. Father McGlynn acceded
to the request, and became military chaplain at Central Park Hospital.
At the close of the civil war his commission lapsed, and Father McGlynn gave
the most of his time to the matter of providing for the spiritual needs of the rap-
Idly increasing Catholic population of New Tork. The subject created a great di
versity of opinion among the various rectors. The majority maintained that the
only cafe way to preserve the purity of the religion was to erect more parochial
schools. Father McGlyr.n took exception to these views and emphatically assert
ed that the necessity was for the multiplication of churches and priests. He ad
vised that until the church became better able financially to support /parochial
echools the public schools of New York he made Use of. 1 ".
For advocating this policy he was accused, both In New York.and.ln Rome, of
opposing Catholic education, but his views were finally accepted as correct.
Father McGlyr.n was a firm supporter of the etagle tax theory of Henry
George, and when George was nominated for Mayor of the city of New York
Father McGlynn took an active interest in the campaign. It was announced' that
he would speak at a meeting of George's supporters. Archbishop Corrigan at once
notified him that such a course could not be permitted,, but Father McGlynn re
plied in a courteous note that his withdrawal then would create a scandal, *nd
fo acted on his prerogative as a citizen. For his disobedience he was suspended
for a definite period, and shortly thereafter, because of an Interview published in
a newspaper and cabled to Rome, he was again suspended. This act was followed
by a eummons to attend the propaganda, "having first abjured his doctrines" con
cerning the single tax theories. Father McGlynn replied through Archbishop Cor
rigan, asking what the doctrines were, ap he was at a loss to know what to "ab
jure." To this came hack an order directing him to appear at Rome within sixty
days under pain of excommunication. Knowing that the Henry George doctrines
had never been examined by the church and being satisfied as well that they were
not in opposition to any tenets of Catholicism, he did not go to Rome. In July
18S7, therefore, he was excommunicated.
Immediately he formed the Anti-Poverty League, and each week addressed
meetings having for their object the extension of the single tax theories. Finally
the church b<Â»gan a thorough Investigation of the conduct of Father McGlynn
with the result that on December 24. 1552, he was absolved from censure and re
etored to all his priestly faculties, and two years later he was reassigned to his
old church In New York. The case created the greatest excitement throughout
America and In Catholic circles generally. . . ( , "

Americans were able to follow.
"The Filipino treatment of the Span
ish," said Lieutenant Glllmore. "was bru
tal In the extreme. The Insurgents had
old icrudges to wipe out against them,
llany talk about the reccncentrados In
Cuba, but I have seen Spaniards dying at
the rate of two or three per day of starva
tion in the hospitals at Vigan. I have
eeen Tagalo officers strike Spaniards In
the face with whips and revolvers." -:;^
Lieutenant Gillmore declined to speak
regarding political conditions, except to
Bay that he thought the insurrection
would last as long as there were any
Tagalos left.
The members of the party reported to
General Otis this morning. They were
barefooted, sunburned and ragged. Some
carried rifles, others pet monkeys. They
attracted a great deal of attention as they
passed along the streets. Those whose en-
Usunents are about expiring will be cent
tc the United States. The others will be
returned to their respective organizations.
Among the prisoners arriving with Lieu
tenant Gillmore were F. J. Hubert, Ed

the Urdaneta; Yon Galen of the Balti

of the Third Infantry; Leland Smith and
Frank Stone of the Signal Corps; Harry

O'Brien and David Brown, civilians..
Brown, who was formerly a preacher In
Honolulu, twice xevealed to the Insurgents

cuso him of treachery, and entertain the
bitterest reelings toward him. * ; â¢

he became too weak to travel and the Fili

BILL TO BE
TAKEN UP
Soon to Be Considered by
Committees 'of ' Senate
and /Hquge/; / \
EARLY REPORT LIKELY
Strong Efforts WUl rÃo- MadÂ£ to
Pass v the Subsidy 'Measnr.e ;

Special Dl? patch to iWcaJL ,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Jan.; 7.â
Senator Frye, and Representatalve Grobve
nor, chairmen, respectively, of .the Senate
Committee, on Commerce - and ' the House
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fish
eries, are- planning to take up .the Hahna-
Payne ship, subsidy bill at. an early date.
Hearings are to be given by both commit
tees to the advocates and' the. opponents
of the measure, and it Is probable that
they will be so timed that the same men
can appear before 'both" committees on
successive days, thus making it unnecos
sary for them to come to Washington
twice. Early and favorable reports on the
bill are expected from both committees,
and strong efforts will be made to get it
through both houses during the present
session.
Division on this bill will not be altogoth
er along party lines. It has been In
dorsed by Republican platforms and con
demned by Democratic platforms in some
States, and as a rule Republicans will fa
vor It and Democrats oppose it. There
will be exceptions on both Bides, however.
It is expected that some Republicans from
the central part of the country will vote
against the bill, but. on the other hand,
some Democrats from seaboard States are
expected to vote for it. All the Democrat
ic members of the New York delegation In
the House, with possibly one exception,
are in favor of the bill, and Representa
tive Chanler, as a member of the Commit
tee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries,
will aid in~ reporting it favorably.
Opposition to the Dill will be largely on
the score of expense. It was to meet this
argument that, on the advice of Repre
sentative Payne, the same bill when be
fore the last Congress was so changed as
to limit the expenditure under it in any
one year to $9,000,(X>9. Advocates of the
bill contend that this limit would not be
reached for several years, and that the
expenditure during the first year would
not exceed J3.000.000.
The object of the bill Is stated to be to
offset, by graded payments from the
treasury, the difference in cost of con
structing vessels in the United States an<l
In Borne European countries, so far as
that difference enters into cost of opera
tion and also to offset other differences
In cost of operation. It is expected that
the enactment of this law will greatly
stimulate shipbuilding In American ship
yards and result in the construction of
enough vessels to ; carry a considerable
proportion of American commerce in
American bottoms. That this result could
not be obtained for some years is shown
by the fact that the present capacity of
American shipyards is row not more than
100,000 gross tons per year.

In each successive message, it
will be seen, General White em

successful he intimates that it is

with the admission that he is be

not lose or seem to lose heart un

What adds seriousness to the
situation is the fact which one of
General Buller's con
veys that he is powerless to help
the beleaguered garrison. With
all his available troops Buller
made a demonstration toward
Colenso on Saturday, his great
object being, of course, to keep
the enemy on the Tugela occu
pied there, but he found the
trenches full of Boers. . There are
evidently enough of them to both
hold the Tugela against Buller
and to press White hard in Lady

General Buller apparently did
not at last reports feel Â¦ himself
strong enough to renew his. ad

but he may have done so later.
If so, we can expect news of , a
bloody battle. If not, then we

SORTIE BY THE BRITISH
RESULTS IN DISASTER
Continued from First Page.
Ing tho Boers, these intrigues will not re
sult seriously.
"Although the Boer agents and their
foreign satellites have done little during
the past week in securlhg supplies for
the Transvaal they ara still very active,
the center of the whole machinery being
Consul Pott. who. besides holding tha
agencies of various steamship lines, is tha
manager of the Empress Afrlcana Land
ing Company, which is the leading land
ing agency here. He Is, therefore, able to
facilitate the discharge of cargoes Intend
ed for the Transvaal. There Is reason to
believe that the controlling Interest In tha
Empress Afrlcana Landing Company Is
held by the Dona-i Currie Company, Btelrj
& Morrlsson and Charles Hutchinson of
Natal. Similarly the local agency of tha
Sheba gold mine is in the hands of a Ger
man firm notorious for Its persistent ef
forts to render services to the Transvaal.
"Some local British banks also assist
this business of forwarding agents by tha
acceptance of Boer drafts for collection
and by Issuing the recently minted Trans
vaal coinage. This Is Important presump
tive evidence that the Boers are securing
an Important quid pro quo. Already wool
to the value of some Â£15.000 has been ex
ported by the Boer republics by way at
Delagoa Bay."

Lieutenant Glllmore has returned to the
naval Bervlce, Interest is being taken la
naval circles here as to the action Rear
Admiral Watson will take. Undoubtedly
Admiral Watson will organize a court of
inquiry. It has been alleged that Lieu
tenant Gillmore acted without authority
In entering the river near Baler; that his
orders required him simply to make a
reconnolssance, and that he exceeded his
instructions.
No matter what the findings of tha
court may be, it Is the disposition of
Secretary Long to be very lenient with
the officer, believing that ho has suffered
sufficiently, even If he were guilty of
Indiscretion.

PHILIPPINES ARE

Bacon's Opposition to

TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan. 7.â
Senator Bacon cf Georgia, who will prob
ably be tie foremost Democratic Sen
ator la opposition ta tie permanent re.
tention of tie Philippines, made tiis re
ply to a question 3.3 to why he is op
posed to expansion: "I understand the
question to relate to tie particular ex
pansion which will result If the Philip
pine Islands are permanently annexed to
the United States. I axa not opposed to
expansion which will, under proper con
ditions, secure the annexation of terri
tory contiguous ta tie United States
whose people can be assimilated to our
own. and which can La the future be
properly admitted as a State la tie
Union.
"An . important faÂ«t tos.be bore* in
mind tn considering- this Question is that
the Philippine Islands are 7000 mi!es away,
thickly populated witi an Asiatic race"
having absolutely nothing tn common
with tsc American people, and many of
th<*m with customs and tnatttttUaoa ab
u^ 2^. t0 our civilization. It ts improb
able that these people should ever be
jus&soatcd to the American people. It
is equally Improbable tha.- tiey should
ever be displaced by Americans or Eu
ropeans. The islands will tor ail time be
substantially peopled by Asiatics only.
In deallr.g with tie question of per
manent annexation, therefore. It may be
accepted as aa unchanging condition
tnat these islands thus remotely situated
are for all time to be Inhabited by this
utter aiien and foreign ri.ee, which can.
never be Americanized."

SAYS GO EBEL WILL WIN .From the tone of Bryan's speech at the Jackson
day banquet in Chicago it appears he is willing to
suggest a plain and absolute remedy for the evils
caused bj trusts, provided he be elected to the Presi
dency, but he is not willing to say what it is before
hand; so it will be seen the boy orator has some dis
cretion after all and knows how to keep his mouth
shut on at least one subject. >v
The proposal to establish a "home" for the purpose
of reforming ex-convicts is very good, but at the
same time it should be remembered that if the pro
posed beneficiaries of the establishment had ever had
any regard for a home*they would never have been
convicts.
There may be disputes as to whether the Pope re
garded New Year's day as the beginning of a new
century or not, but there can be none about the
Kaiser's opinion. It is the twentieth century in Ger
many at any rate.

BRYAN'S LATEST GABBLE.
SIX hundred Democrats, seated at a banquet in
Chicago to celebrate Jackson day, heard Bryan
make his latest speech. There was a time
when a speech by that orator on such an occasion
would have been reported almost to the word and the
whole country would have paid attention. That time,
however, was in the days of depression, when the
calamity howler was a power in the land and when
even conservatives gave heed to what he said in order
that they might know to what extent the agitation of
class antagonism was being carried. In these days
of prosperity the country little heeds or cares what is
rttered upon themes of that kind, and accordingly
even the Bryan organs themselves give but a brief
summary of what he said and what the 600 heard.
In the brief report that comes to us of the speech
Bryan is quoted as saying: "The currency bill fastens
us to the financial systems of the Old World and sub
jects us to all the disturbances which affect them,
while it places the control of the volume of paper
money in the hands of a bank trust, which will be as
merciless to the people of this country as Weyler was

to the reconcentrados. The fight for bimetallism at
the ratio of 16 to 1 has not been lost. The increased
production of gold has shown the advantage of more
money and has answered the argument so often made
that the parity could not be maintained because of the
overproduction of silver." He declared that the Re
publican party is unable to enact and enforce efficient
anti-trust laws and that the Democratic party when
in power will meet the issue with a plain and posi
tive remedy. ?;-;} -
In all that there is nothing beyond the repetition
of the old misrepresentations. The currency bill does
not fasten upon us the financial system of the Old
World, but of the New World and the new age. It is
the outcome of the conditions of our own land and
our own time. By the study of economics men have
learned something of the natural laws which regulate
trade and finance, and the object of the bill now be
fore Congress is to apply those laws to the needs of
the people of the United States. It is the language
of a demagogue to term it an OW World system and
to attempt to arouse against it the unreasoning
prejudices of men who are incapable of understanding
financial questions, or who, through partisan perver
sity, oppose any and every measure that has not its
origin in their own party. /
Just how the increase in the output of gold and the
abounding evidence of the existence of a sufficient
amount of gold to supply the monetary needs of the
world have weakened the argument advanced by the
sound-money men in 1896 and confirmed the; free
silver agitators, Mr. Bryan will have, to explain? by
diagrams. It was asserted by Bryan that unless silver
were remonctized there would be a. continuous fall in
prices. The world knows there has been a rise in
prices, and now Bryan says the rise proves he was
right. It is fortunate for the orator that he is known
to be a total abstainer from intoxicating liquors,
otherwise there is much in that argument which
would incline folks to believe it inspired less by states
manship than by bourbon.
The assertion that if intrusted with â¢ power the
Democratic party will provide a plain and positive
remedy for the evils resulting from trusts, is another
feature of the speech that requires explanation. Mr
Bryan should state clearly what he regards as the evil
feature of trust organizations, and what is the remedy
he would apply. He had an opportunity to do both
of those things at the Chicago conference on the trust
question and he failed to do either of them.
From the short reports given of the speech it is
easy to understand why more was not sent out.
There was evidently nothing in it worth reporting.
Within the burr was a chestnut and within the chest
nut only dust. Bryan may still be a Presidential
candidate, but as an orator he has exhausted every
thing except his lungs.
THE LAW AND THE LADY.
M T the meeting of the Mothers' Union of Golden
/ \ Gate on Saturday there was adopted a resolu
tion requesting the co-operation of the Oak
land Club and other societies to petition the Oakland
merchants to provide scats for the lady clerks in all
the stores and shops where they have not provided
them.
The resolution was the outcome of a discussion
upon the injurious effects which certain kinds of work
have upon women and its object is to provide for
the health and welfare of those who arc engaged in
stores and who arc frequently required to remain on
their feet almost continuously from the time the store
opens for business early in the morning until it closes
at night.
With that object all who are interested in the wel
fare of the race must have a warm sympathy. The
Mothers' Union of t Golden Gate will therefore find
cordial co-operation in the work they have under
taken and their petition to the merchants will be
strongly supported. If the merchants should ignore
the petition or refuse to accede to it the Mothers'
Union has an easy method of redress in the law of
the State, to which recourse should be promptly
taken.
There was approved February 6. 1889, "an act to
provide for the proper sanitary condition of factories
and workshops and the preservation of the health of
employes." Portions of it applicable to the case at
issue run thus:
"Section 5. Every person, firm or corporation em
ploying females in any manufacturing, mechanical or
mercantile establishment shall provide suitable seats
for the use of the females so employed and shall per
mit the use of such seats by them when they are not
necessarily engaged in the active duties for which they
arc employed.
"Section 6. Any person or corporation violating
any of the provisions of this act shall be punished by
a fine of not less than fifty nor more than one hundred
dollars for each offense.
"Section 7. It shall be the duty of the Commis
sioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to enforce
the provisions of this act."
The ladies will perceive that the remedy for the
evil complained of is amply provided. It will be best,
of course, to begin by directing the attention of of
fending merchants to the law and requesting a com
pliance with its requirements. If that means fails
the ladies should at once notify the Commissioner of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the violation of the
law and it will be his duty to enforce it.
It is gratifying that there are women who are suf
ficiently considerate of the welfare of working girls to
engage actively in supporting their fights and pro
viding for their welfare. As is pointed out by the
Labor Commissioner in an interview, published in
another column, his office has no patrol force to seek
out offenders against the law and therefore he can act
only when his attention is drawn to some violation of
it. The girls employed in the stores dare not make
complaint. For that reason the agency of such asso
ciations as the Mothers* Union is necessary to the en
forcement of the law and it should be exerted con
tinuously and with vigor throughout the State.
MOTHER LODE STUDIES.
STORMS GOES AFIELD.
CRIPPLE CREEK'S GOLD.
NEW MINING DECISION.
HOW CLAIMS WERE WON
TO-DAY "W. H. Storms, tha latest
"Examiner of Mines" to be ap
pointed by Governor Gage, will
start for the mother lode region,
where he will spend the ensuing
months In spite of mud and snow, which
have In the past kept Mining Bureau ex
perts out of the mountain mining fields.
This will be the first time in three years
that the mother lode, or, in fact, the gold
regions of the State have received any at
tention from the bureau except in the
compilation of yet unpublished maps.
There have been great developments
along the mother lode in that time. The
era of deep mining there has recently
opened and great operations, costing mil
lions of dollars, are under way. Electric
power has been distributed to many mines
during that period anA various Improved
processes^ have been Installed and new
problems~met with.
The miners of that region will welcome
Mr. Storms^as an expert familiar with the
region for years, and as the most compe
tent one available for the task. He goes
at once to Amador County, w..ere he will
remain some time. It is planned that
he shall put In most of his time along the
mother lode from Mariposa County north
during the nejet eighteen months, and
give as much attention as time will al
low to the mining regions further north.
He will aim to inspect every mine of
W. H. STORMS, Examiner of Mines
any Importance in each county, gaining all
the Information that owners are willing
to allow him, observing the geology,
methods of working, conditions imposed,
etc.. and note progress and prospects
without endeavoring to go Into private
financial matters which miners generally
want to keep to themselves. He expects!
to be able to make his reports more com
plete and of more practical use to mining
men than most former bureau reports.
Improvements in methods, costs of oper
ation, if they can be given, comparisons
of different mines, what operators have
accomplished at great depth and what
they expect to accomplish and similar In
formation will be especially sought, and
In setting forth such Information the con
ditions must necessarily be completely
given. The big mining field is rich In op
portunity for interesting and valuable re
ports, and the miners will hope to see
some of this character in spite of the
political mess into which the bureau has
dropped.
It may be observed that not the least
of the benefits of this sort of field work
Is the personal dissemination of informa
tion nnd expert advice, as an official with
a broad knowledge of mining science and
practice and an acquaintance with how
things are done all through the mining
field comes in constant contact with
miners, often sharing their beds or bunks,
their bottles or bacon and meeting with
them their problems and mistakes. A
field man has a varied experience and Is
a mining missionary constantly distribut
ing pointers amid the hills.
Generally he is appreciated, but some
times he Is scorned by miners who look
on all "experts" with supreme contempt,
and sometimes they chuckle and plan a
scheme to make a fool of him.
While he was a field deputy of the bu
reau four or five years ago. Storms
climbed to a prospect in Calaveras Coun
ty where two old miners were sinking on
a vein in which they thought they had
struck It at last. The shatt was eighty
feet deep, and when Dan had hauled up
the bucket by a windlass, Storms saw that
it was fastened to the rope by a simple
loop held by a slippery pointed stick,
easily pulled out to take off the bucket.
"Want to see the bottom?" asked old
Dan. "No, I don't," said Storms. '"Why
not? Just go down and see how purty
she widens." urged the lucky partner
above. "Not in that rig." said Storms.
"That pin will drop out, the first thing
you know, and somebody will be killed.
Why don't you fix it this way?" "Oh.
Scotty! There's a mining expert up here
'fraid to go down 'cause he's 'fraid the
bucket'll come off with him." Dan shout
ed down the golden well. "Haw! Haw!
Haw!" came up from where Scotty was
tickled in the mudoy gloom. Two weeks
later they burled Scotty and soon Dan
bought the widow's Interest In the widen
ing vein. Nobody knew how It happened,
and they seldom do, but the slippery un
safe pin did It. and the Mining Bureau
did not save poor Scotty.
Preliminary estimates of the precious
metal product of California for 1599 have
been made by the Director of the Mint
and by the Superintendent, and the statis
tician of the San Francisco Mint, and, as
tisual. they disagree. They always do dis
agree. Each year the director receives
careful estimates from local representa
tives of the bureau here and there, and
then goes for them with an ax, apparent
ly on general principles.
It was stated In this column a short ttme
ago that the gold product for 1599 woud
probably show a small decrease on ac
count of the unprecedented lack of water,
In spite of the great increase of develop
ment. Statistician Charles G. Yale, how
ever, discovered an increase, estimated at
about $500,000. The Director of the M'nt
makes his estimate $14,952,392, a decrease
of over a half-million.
The disagreement Is not highly Impor
tant, as both estimates are preliminary
ones. The final estimate, which will be
the official record, will be ready In April,
and It will be compiled from confidential
returns from practically every producer In
the State, supplemented by information
from every available and reliable source
possible. This arduous work has now been
begun by Mr. Yale. Whatever the result
may be. It will doubtless show no great
variation from the output of IMS. It Is uf
more Importance to realize that the boun
tiful rains and snows of the present season
and the steadily multiplying mining fÂ».c
tlvlty will provide 1900 with an Increase cf
the gold output in California that will
reach well Into the millions.
The local mint estimated the silver
product at $636,000. and Director Roberts
?ut !t at $1,396,363. This difference aribes
rom the fact that the former used th*>
market value, 53 cents, and the latter the
coinage value. $1.2929. In estimating the
product, which was about 1,200,000 ounces.
Because California has at last besn
passed bj* Colorado as a gold producing
State, Colorado's record and the reason
for it are of interest. The year's recori
is about $26,000,000. and the reason is en
tirely the rapid development of the world's
most remarkable gold field. Cripple Creek,
which covers an area of but a few square
miles. The chief facts of Cripple Creek's
record for the past year are given In the
following special report to The Call from
Colorado Springs:
COLOrtADO SPRINGS, Colo., Jan. 2.â The
mines of Cripple Creek produced during the
year 1899 $20,241,842. a net gÂ»ln of 33 per cent
over the production of IS9S. which was $15.602. tw).
As Indicated by the above the year has been
one of marked prosperity In the great gold
c&mp of Colorado. While over 300 mines helped
to make up the year's record-breaking produc
tion the large producer* Â¦wer*: Btratton's In
dependence. $1,500,000: the Portland. $2.300.0>J0;
the Gold Coin. $1,150,000: the Jack Pot. $*30.0 CO;
the Vindicator. $1,000,000; the Llllle and a
ecore of others.
The rear's progress In Cripple Creek was
marked by the opening up of the largest and
richest ore bodies at the greatest depth yet
attained in this camp, viz., I(XV> feet, and also
by the extending of the gold-bearing are* by
several miles. These two facts form the basis
for the prediction that next year the camp
will produce $:6.0n0,000 In gold.
I>urlng the year thirty-two companies paid
dividends amounting to $4,611,365. The tnt.il
amount of dividends paid by Cripple Creek
mines to date Is $11,777,167. In addition to this
*urn there have been distributed by close cor
porations and earned by lessees profits amount-
Ing to $0,00<>,000, so that the camp has earned
to date over $16.50Q,t>X>.
Wholesale dealing in Cripple Creek mlnlns:
stock has been a feature of the year. The
vales upon the Colorado Springs Mining Stock
Exchange during this time amounted to 235.
319.221 shares, of a cash value of *34.527.0<V>. On
this exchange last year there were sold 67.0T.5.
000 shares, of a cash value of $10,351,000. The
valuation of outstanding Cripple Creek Btocks
to-day is estimated to be $60,000,000.
This camp has produced In the first nine
years of Its history $73,707,342. Puring the year
the monthly output more than doubled, reach-
Ing $3,000,000 In December.
In most mining towns, as elsewhere,
the last midnight of '99 saw a pande
monium of noise. One mother lode
Journal observes that every sign in town
got from one to six playful bullets in It,
and rather condemns this method of cele
bration.
But all through the mining regions
there were midnight doings as quiet as
the town tolks were noisy. 'Twas the
hour when claim-Jumpers strike. The
evening knew hundreds of stealthy trips
into the hills to claims on which assess
ment work was due, and within a few
minutes after midnight hundreds of lo
cation notices were going up according to
secret plan and knowledge. A good pro
portion of the thousands of claims taktn
up during- 1&98 were fully open to loca
tion, the nolders not being able to afford
the $100 worth of work or having too
many claims to take care of. If the lo
cators had not done the work they could
relocate January land hold for another
two years, and in many cases they were
on hand for that purpose and with guns
along to stand off the fellows who
stealthily came for the same object. That
midnight would provide many good min
ing stories.
Here and there, as always, were un
protected mines of known value on which
the assessment work was not done
through mistake or neglect. One was the
Good Hope. near Jackson. Amador
County, in which Senator John F. Davis
lately became interested. It was wrongly
supposed that the work had been done,
and 'some parties"' laid quiet and elab
orate plans to jump the mine and had
hired a "gun fighter" to aid in the job.
lne gun tighter had too long a tongue
and the plan leaked out Saturday niÂ«rht.
Just as Judge Davis arrived from San
I-rancisco. A force of men was rushed
to the property that night and $100 worth
â¢ J' ork t â¢ done b y the following mid
night, thus saving the mine.
On the Mojave desert at Randsburg
and beyond prospecting for water Is now
going busily on by means of vertical
borings and tunnels into hills, and lucky
"strikes" are being made. A fair supply
of water in a mining r*gion where It
costs a bit a drink for mules would work
wonders for the Industry. The desert
also has an oil excitement In a district
near Mojave, where there is not the
slightest sign of oil but where the for
mations have been pronounced favor
able. Railroad men have secured large
tracts in which to prospect, and thi3
Knowledge started a rush the moment It
became known. The desert is now es
pecially interested in the precious liquids.

enterprises. According to the George
town Gazette teamsters are busy hauline
slate from the Strahle quarry at Kelsey
to Placerville, wnere it la ."hipped by rail
The slate is of the first quality, and it
is said they cannot take it out fast

eighteen men are employed.
.A' the Pioneer copper mine, near Pilot
Hill, a force oi twelve men is now em
ployed doing development work, says the

have been erected and other preparations
made for a thorough development of this

averages 8 per cent, the ore also contains
gold and silver.
The Introduction of steam traction en

BOASTING TRACK GAMBLERS.
WHEN in response to the demands of publijc
sentiment the Supervisors put an end to the
tnick gambling at Ingleside, The Call warned
the people that the victory would not be permanent
unless it were guarded with vigilance. The profits
of the gamblers -were enormous and it was a fore
gone conclusion that they would leave untried no
means which gave the slightest promise of a chance to
reopen the track and resume their trade.
Sure as it was that the gamblers would try to re
cover their ground, it is with something of surprise
the public learns of the boasting of some of the more
bold and unscrupulous among them that Ingleside
Park will be opened again for unlimited racing, that
the old gambling games will be resumed there and
that once more the touts, the toughs and the black
legs of the community will have a free field in which
to prey upon the lollies and the vices of the unwary
and the corrupt.
These boasters assert that the incoming Board of
Supervisors will grant them permission to reopen
at Ingleside; that a majority, at least, of the new Su
pervisors have given pledges to that effect. It
is a boast which the public will be inclined to regard
with contemptuous incredulity, and yet it is one
which should not be overlooked. In dealing with an
evil of this kind continual vigilance is necessary, for
the profits are so large and so sure there will be al
ways big inducements for permitting its practice.
The outgoing Board of Supervisors enacted the
ordinance which closed the track at Ingleside, only
after the fullest evidence had been given of the mani
fold evils resulting from it. These evils were of many
kinds and degrees. Shop boys were enticed to
neglect their work to hang around poolrooms, con
fidential clerks were led to defraud their employers to
obtain "money for gambling, men of all classes in
society were corrupted by . the associations of the
track; even women did not escape its blighting influ
ence and the home, as well as the shop and the office,
was cursed by it. A long record of crimes blackens
the pages of history of the community while the track
flourished. There were frauds, defalcations, divorces,
embezzlements, robberies, assaults, murders and sui
cides traceable directly to the effects of the race track
gambling. Is it possible that with a recent suicide
due to gambling fresh in the public mind the incom
ing Board of Supervisors can think of reopening 1
Ingleside under the management of the same old gang
and reviving all the evil which the outgoing board
suppressed?
Upon Mayor Phelan at any rate it would seem that
the public can count in this emergency. He cannot
consent to the reopening of the Ingleside gambling
without stultifying himself. He signed the ordinance
closing the track. He vetoed an ordinance that
wouldhavepermittedpool-selling at coursing matches.
If he now consents to give the Eastern track gamblers
full swing there he will wrong his own record be
yond atonement.
CHANGES IN COMMERCIAL RANK.
XHE first week of the new year showed a bare
pain of 0.9 per cent in bank clearings over the
first week of 1899. New York lost 2.6 per cent,
Boston 1.4 per cent and New Orleans 17.9 per cent.
San Francisco gained 31.8 per cent and Pittsburg,
whose clearings represent almost exclusively the iron
and steel trade, 27.5 per cent.
These bank clearings mark some change in the rela
tive business of American cities during the year 1899.
New York, of course, kept first place, with clearances
of Sfo.JTj 1.791,000, out of a total for the whole country
of $93.5QVW.000. Boston moved ahead of Chicago,
the latter dropping to third place, the clearings of
Boston being $7,086.29^,000. and those of Chicago
$6^12.313x100. Cleveland, whirh was in the thirteenth
place in 1898. moved up one. displacing New Orleans.
The other large cities retained their 1898 status. San
Francisco ranking eighth, coming betwen Baltimore
and Cincinnati. The heaviest increase during the year
was 56 per cent by Pitt^burg, owing to the remarkable
activity in the iron trade.
We paid higher prices for everything in 1899, but
fiom present indications will pay even higher prices
this year. Already some advances have been made in
the minor lines of iron and steel and in boots and
shoes and a further advance in woolens is predicted.
If the new year starts off in this aggressive fashion
on the basis of already high prices, the question natur
ally arises. Where is the advance going to stop?
There is a limit to the purchasing capacity of the
public, but apparently the manufacturers think it has
not yrt been reached. If the advance in merchandise
is accompanied by a corresponding advance in wages
it can be maintained indefinitely, but if the latter keep
down, then the rise in commodities must come to an
end and in this case the end might be rude.
Wall street opened the new year like a lamb.
Easier conditions in the money market, coupled with
effmive support given the railroads and industrials
by powerful interests, gave a good tone to the market
and for a couple of days the feeling was rather firm
than otherwise: but the German irritation over the
British seizures in Delagoa Bay led to free selling of
American securities by Germans, both in London and
New York, and the market lost much of its previous
tone, especially as' the German realization was sup
plemented by vague reports of further British re
verses in South Africa. We are now sufficiently ad
vanced in the South African war to see that until it is
finished there will be more or less uneasiness and un
certainty in the money markets all over the world.
Prospects in California continue brilliant, though it
must be confessed that, the continuous rains are great
ly delaying farming operation* in the northern, central
and coast sections of the State. In some of the most
important counties very little work has been done
and the reason for petting in the crops is half gone.
The farmers in these counties are beginning to think
that there is such a thing as too much even of a good
thing. However, it will not be calamitous if the pro
duction of the State is cut down somewhat, for our
capacity in the way of turning out crops is immense
ar.d overproduction is a synonym fur Jo*- prices.
With a fortnight of cKir weather a vast deal of farm
rork may still be done, so the time for the croaker
to cmcr K e from his long seclusion has hardly yet ar
rived. He will crawl out of his hole and make hi*
batrachian voice heard before long, however, unless
if stops raining for a few day's.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 8, 1900.
THE OUTGOING SUPERVISORS.
THE Board of Supervisors that goes out of office
to-day merits public recognition and acknowl
edgment of the zeal and efficiency with which it
has performed its duties and the fidelity with which it
fulfilled every pledge and promise made during the
campaign when its members were candidates for of
fice.
The record is one which it would be hard to
parallel in the history of any legislative body in
America. It has had no parallel in recent years in
San Francisco. In not one single instance can it be
shown that this board has failed in the performance of
anything which it was elected and specifically charged
by the voters to do. All the issues of the canvass
when it was before the people have been met and
adequately provided for.
The task was not an easy one. The dollar limit
pledge, for example, was demanded by the platforms
of both parties and was sustained by the voters during
the canvass. Still, when the time came to make the
apportionment of funds for the various departments
of the city and county government a tremendous
pressure was brought to bear upon the Supervisors
to induce them to break their. pledge and levy a higher
tax. Many of the very men who during the canvass
were most insistent on the dollar limit, were among
the first and most aggressive in their urging that
the pledge be broken. Against all that clamor and
against all promises of favors to be shown the Super
visors stood firm. They fixed a tax levy not exceed
ing one dollar, kept their pledge in letter and in
spirit and gave the city the revenue which the voters
had decided to be sufficient.
That was an instance in which the board showed its
firmness in opposing the demands of public officials
who desired large sums of money to dispose of and
of office-seekers and job-chasers who wished a chance
to profit by the disposal. In the recent contest
against the telephone company an instance was af
forded of the courage and public spirit of the board
in combating the greed and resisting the persuasions
of corporations which have grown rich by something
like extortion upon the public. It is useless to go
over the whole record. The two instances cited show
that the board did its duty in every case without fear
or favor of corporations or of bssscs.
The record of the outgoing board should excite in
the new board a spirit of laudable emulation to equal
the service of its predecessor and merit as much
praise and commendation when it retires from office.
It will be with that wish the people will to-day wel
come the outgoing board back to the duties and re
wards of private life and speed the new board in the
work that lies before it.

IX.â OTHELLO.
The Play as an Acting Drama.
Considered simply as a dream of passion !
In action. . "Othello" is Shakespeare's
greatest play, and the greatest play the
world has seen. "Hamlet" may send its
plummet down to greater depths of wis
dom and philosophy, and may also rise to
much higher nights of poetic expression.
"Macbeth" and "King Lear" may reach
their tragic culminations by a subtler evo
lution of their dramatic motives. But
"Othello," in its swift and certain devel
opment of theme from simple beginning
to awful end. stands supreme. As a trag
edy of elemental human passion It la un
equaled In literature.
The history of "Othello" as an acting
play Justifies these statements. Its popu
larity In this respect, with the possible
without limitations. Tils art was not
universal. Nor was it without many
blemishes that actors of far less ability
anil fame have been guiltless of.
Moreover. Kenn was not phvslcally well
qualified for the realization of many of
the great roles he essayed. Hl3 figure
v.as not commanding; his voice was
harsh and ur.pleasing. But In his best
range, a^id especially when he was in
the full plenitude of his powers, the
fiSie of Edmund Kean's acting eclipses
that of every other actor in tragedy.
The only actress or actor whose
fame is at all comparable with his is
Mrs. Siddons.
Othello was Kean's greatest part. As
to this there is a fullness of evidence.
The elder Booth told Edwin Booth that
"no mortal man could equal Kean In tha
rendering of Othello's despair and rage";
that "his voice when he spoke tho words.
'Farewell, Othello's occupation's gone.'
sounded like the moan of the ocean or
the soughing of the wind through cedars."
. One characteristic of Kean'3 Imper
sonation of Othello Is worth noting.
Actors prior to him. even Garrick. Barry
and John Kemble. had represented
Othello as as African, or. in other words.
a negro. There is nothing in thÂ» play of
"Othello" as Shakespeare wrote it to
Justify this. The ascription of negro
characteristics to Othello by other char
acters in thÂ© play is the outcome, of
Jealousy and hatred. The Othello of
bhakespeare is dark skinned, but not
necessarily a negro. Kean represented
Othello as a "Moor," a Mauritanian, and
nothing more.
Coleridge said of Kean that "seeing him
act was reading Shakespeare by flashes
of lightning." This lightning-like genius
had scarcely displayed Its full brilliancy
before it began to be consumed by its
own heat and flame. Edmund Kean's life
was as sorrowful a tragedy as any he
ever, enacted upon the mimic stage. Ha
who was able to transport thousands by
his portrayal of imaginary passion 3.
which he couM assume or throw off at
will, became the victim of a passion of
his own which he could throw- off only
with hi 3 life.
Kean's last appearance upon thÂ© stags
was in Covent Garden Theater. March
23. 1533. He was then only 46. But for
years the glory of his genius had been
waning, and its power by this time, ex
cept occasionally in flashes, was only the
mere wraith of what it once had been.
On this night he was playing Otnello to

great actor seemed to be himself ones

words "Othello's occupation's gone."

"Oh God:" he cried. "I am dying! Speak

were his last words. The career of the
greatest Othello, the greatest Shylock and
the greatest Richard 111 the world has
known was ended. A few weeks later ha

Questions for Research and Review.
1. Are you prejudiced against Othello at
the outset? Why? Are you still prejudiced
at the close of act 1? By what means does
the poet cause Othello to grow in your es
teem through the remainder of the play?
2. How does Shakespeare keep us from
sympathizing much with Barbantlo?
3. What Is the dramatic purpose of the*
various scenes in which great affairs of
state are introduced?
4. Is Desdemona equally great with
Othello when both are on trial in the pres
ence of her father? Does Brabantlo's de
scription of Desdemona's character show
complete comprehension of her?
5. Is Desdemona' s lie concerning the
handkerchief a dramatic necessity? How
is her He Just before her death to be re
garded?
6. What Is Othello's motive la killing
Desdemona? Is it jealousy?
7. What use is made of race differences
In bringing on the tragic conclusion of the
play? Is there anything unnatural In Des
demona's love for a Moor? Does Othello
show race peculiarities?
8. Does lago become either better or
worse as the play advances? How explain
Othello's esteem of him?
9. Do you think lago's face and form
completely belled his character? Is he old
or young? Has he any real excuse for his
villainy? Any real motive?
10. How do lago and Richard 111 com
pare as villains? Which is the more artis
tic? Which the more cruel? Which the
more plausible?
11. How does lago gain his ascendency
over Othello in act 3. scene 3? Does he
take lower moral groud apparently? In
the reunion scene (act 2 scene 1> what U
the significance of lago's part?
12. By what means does lago keep Rod
erigo on the road to ruin? What are the
successive steps In Roderlgo's degenera
tion? How often does Roderigo serve the
main plot? At what point does he ceasÂ»
to be necessary?
13. Is Casslo necessary? At what points
In the play?
14. In what scenes is Emilia most ser
viceable to the plot of the play?
15. Is Othello's suicide a dramatic neces
sity?
16. For what sins do the various offend
ers against moral laws pay the axtrema
penalty?

Tempestuous Voyage
of the E. B. Sutton.
A CRAZY JAPANESE STEWARD
Â»
WANTED TO KILL THE CAPTALN
AND CHIEF OFFICER.
The Ship Was Caught in the October
Storms That Damaged the Over

Water Front.
After being thirty-six hours on her
beam ends and being buffeted by every
wind that blew for thirty-four days off
the Horn, the American ship E. B. Sut
ton finally reached port yesterday. Dur
ing the voyage the Japaneses steward ran
amuck and had to be put in irons to pre
vent him from murdering the captain
and mate and killing himself. There are
1000 cases of lubricating oil among the
cargo of coal, and when It began to leak
Captain Carver was in great straits for
fear of spontaneous combustion. All the
dangers were finally overcome, however,
and the E. B. Sutton reached port with
the Japanese steward in irons.
Joe Koch was shipped in Philadelphia
and proved himself to be a surly individu
al from the start. He had to be repri
manded on several occasions, but made
no outbreak until last week. Last Fri
day he had not been attending to his work
and when spoken to about It started for
ward after telling the Japanese cook that
he was going to kill Captain Carver, Mate
Saunders and himself. Upon reaching his
room he armed himself with a revolver
and came out on deck again.
In the meantime one of the crew had
told the mate that the Japanese was
armed and meant mischief. The chief
officer at once went forward and as soon
as Koch attempted to draw his gun the
mate knocked him down. He then called
the watch and the Japanese was placed
in irons.
In his report of the voyage. Captain
Carver says:
October 7, latitude 66 IS south, longitude 63

The Sutton carries many signs of her
hard usage. The 'railing Is gone, the hull
bears a battered appearance and the ship
has a slight list lo starboard. During her
encounter with the Horn weather the
cargo shifted, but after several hours'
hard work the crew got the vessel on an
even keel again. All in all, the E. B.
Sutton had an experience during the
month of October that nobody aboard
wants to repeat. The vessel sailed In and
came to an anchor off the Presidio. To
day she will be towed up the bay and will
be docked under one of the bunkers.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 7.â The statements

WORK OF A SECOND
"JACK THE RIPPER"
Bobbery Was Not the Motive for
the Murder of Zachel
Ferguson.
TORONTO. Jan. 7.â lnvestigation In
connection with the murder of Miss Ra
chel Ferguson last Friday night discloses
the fact that the motive was not robbery
and that the crime was in all probability
the work of a man of the same character
as "Jack the Ripper."
Within an hour before the murder two
other young girls were chased and a
third knocked down by the same man in
the same vicinity. The post mortem ex
amination discloses the fact that the skull
of the victim was terribly smashed and
that she had apparently been struck down
while passing the jail gate and dragged
to the spot inside the wall where she was
found. The murderer is still at liberty.

CONVICTS AND LUNATICS.
Rev. James A. B. Wilson on "The
Lessons of the Century."
Under the caption of "The Lessons of
the Century," the Rev. Dr. James A. B.
Wilson discoursed on the present and past
conditions of lunatics and convicts, in his
lecture at last night's service. "Ad far
back as IS4S." he said, "In the State of
Connecticut, It was the custom and du
t'es of the keepers of convicts to chain
their wards to iron bars during the night
time. This was done not as a precaution
of safety, but rather as one of punish
ment and degradation, and as It was in
Connecticut, so was it in other New Eng
land States, not to mention the countries
cf I'urope, -\vheit criminals were looked
upon and treated as so many wild beasts.
Flogging, branding and other barbarous
punishments were, invariably inflicted
upon persons convicted of crime, tho'isrh
the effences might be no more than mis
demeanors. Insane persons were looked
upon as being possessed of evil demons
and to extract the demons from the in
dividuals was considered the duty of the
persons having charge of those unfortun
ate ones.
"Theso conditions have changed witnln
the last fifty years, and to-day peiHt.ns
convicted of crime? against the co.nmuni
ty are bolng treats..! with hurr.an.j con
sideration, always with the view c* cor
recting the Individual and making him a
better man than he was before he fell
from grace. Inducements are being heM
out to the convict to better his condition
after he haa paid the penalty for his mis
deeds. The laws as now framed offer to
the man every chance to become good,
whereas In former times there were no
such inducements offered. The treatment
of the insane has also been changed for
the better, and the disease of the brain
is no longer looked upon as a crime, but
rather as a misfortune over which the In
dividual has no control, and one he should
not be punished for. :Â¦â¢ '.
"This wonderful change has been
brought about by the enlightenment of
the age anu through the instrumentallty
of Christian influence, together with the
almighty aid of the public press. To the
press, perhaps, more is due than to any
other influence, the bringing about of this
great information In the treatment of the
criminal classes and the lunatics. The
public press draws public opinion to
abuses and no power can withstand Its
Influence when rightly directed."
exception of "Hamlet." Is without rival.
"Othello" was popular in Shakesperean
times, when Burbage played the Moor.
And, except in the puritan and Crom
wellian epoch, when all plays were for
bidden, it has been popular ever since.
From the time of the Restoration (13G0)
down to the very present there has never
been a year in which "Othello" has not
held its place on the boards as one of the
best "drawing" plays in the theatrical
repertoire.
And in one respect "Othello" has out
done "Hamlet" in its hold 'on popular fa
vor. "Othello" has never been "adapted."
It has always been presented, with the ex
ception of some shortening, practically as
Shakespeare wrote It. This cannot be said
of "Hamlet." Even Garrick, Shakes
perean lover as he was, altered Shakes
peare's "Hamlet" to suit his fancy. And
other adapters and improvers of "Hamlet "
there have been of lesser fame. But no
playwright, great or small, has ever pre
sumed to lay desecrating hands on
"Othello."
Fine as "Othello" Is as an acting play.
Its quality as a play for reading only i 3
equally fine. No other play that Shaken
peare has written holds the attention cf
the reader from beginning to end with
such enthrallment of mind and sense. Its
spell is continuous and complete.
The acting editions of "Othello" do not
present the play in it 3 entirety. Theatri
cal representations In Shakespeare's day
were much longer than those of our day.
None of the time of the spectators was
taken up with scene shifting, orchestral
performances, etc. A play as Shakes
peare wrote it has. therefore, to be con
siderably condensed to make it fit the con
ditions of a modern representation.
Notwithstanding that this is so, "Othel
lo" as it was originally written is so logi
cal and complete in its dramatic con
struction that scarcely a line can be
struck out without weakening it. Hence
those who know "Othello" only from see
ing, it played do not know it completely.
No person should go to see "Othello"
upon the stage without first reading and
studying the play in printed form.
"Othello" has the distinction among
plays of having two parts of almost first
clars importance for male actors, and one
part of almost first-class importance ! for
a female actor, while several of its minor
parts call for acting of more than an or
dinary character. It follows then that
the history of "Othello" as an acting play
would be a history of the entire English
stage. This consideration will show how
imperfect a treatment of its history is
possible here.
A point worthy of remembrance is that
It was in "Othello." in the part of Desde
mona, that the first woman impersonator
of a Shakespearen heroine, the first Eng
lish woman to act any part of any sort,
ever appeared. This was December 8.
1660. So extraordinary was the Innovation
that It was thought necessary to apolo
gize for it In the prologue. A part of this
prologue ran as follows:
"In this reforming age
We have Intents to civilize the staxa.
Our women are defective, and so siz'd
You'd think they were some of the guard Â£j s _
guis'd:
For to speak truth, men act, that are between
Forty and fifty, wenches of fifteen:
Â¦With bone so large, and nerve so uncompliant.
When you call 'Desdemona.' enter 'Giant.* "
This, It must be remembered, was in
the first few months of the Restoration
period. In the days of Shakespeare and
afterward until puritan ideas became so
dominant that all playing was prohlb
led, the parts of women In plays had
been taken by young boys, duly appren
ticed and trained. It was from the ranks
of these boy players that the players of
men's parts were generally recruited.
Theatrical playing was then a respecta
ble and lucrative profession. The puritan
regime changed all this. When the Res
toration again allowed playing to be
done, the apprenticeship system was no
longer in vogue. As a consequence, fe
male parts were soon generally assumed
by women.
All the great players in tragedy known
to the history of the stage have taken
part in "Othello," either as Othello or
as lago, and in some vises as both.
These great players in "Oniello" form a
regular succession of "kings of the
drama," Beginning with Shakespeare's
Burbage, the succession, or "dynasty,"
may be set down as follows: Burbage.
Betterton (who in 1709 played Othello for
the last time at the age of 74). Barton
Booth. Quin. Macklln (who, however,
played only Iago). Garrlck. Barry (some
times Garrick played lago to Barry's
Othello), Thomas Sheridan (the father of
Sheridan the dramatist), John Hender
son, John Kemble. George Frederick
Cooke (who. like Macklin, also played
only Iago), Edmund Kean, Junius Brutus
Booth (who played lago to Kean's Othel
lo), Edwin Forrest (who also played lago
to Kean's Othello). Macready. Samuel
Phelps, Edwin Booth and Henry Irving.
Booth and Irvlns at one time played
Othello and lago together alternately.
Of distinguished foreigners who have
played Othello, the more noted are the
Frenchman, Charles Fechter (with
whom, however, the part was much In
ferior to his Hamlet.) and the great Ital
ian Othello, Tommaso SalvinU
Interesting notes could be written on
the parts taken in the play of "Othello"
by all these players; but on the princi
ple that something about one thing Is a
great deal better than nothing much
about many things, let us confine our at
tention to that greatest of all Othellos.
that greatest. Indeed, of all Shakespeare
an actors, Edmund Kean.
Though Kean's genius for the highest
form of acting was so transcendent. It
must not be understood that It was
Ide was noticed the old lady was nearly
dead. Policeman J. E. Edwards? was
called In and he hurried Mrs. Dennison to
the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Cherry
soon had her out of danger. Later In the
day she was taken home by her relatives.
>lrs. Dennison Is about ia years of age.
John Ambrose was removed from the
Salvation Army barracks on the corner
of Kearny and Sacramento streets in an
Intoxicated condition by Officer T. Con
way and taken to the Harbor Hospital
for treatment. Ambrose got drunk on
Chinese gin and the Salvation Army
picked him ud and tried to fix him up.
His scalp was cut and his right eyebrow
laid open. He was fighting mad and
would not let the Salvation lassies do
anything for him. On his way to the
Harbor Hospital he fought Policeman
Conway like a tiger and another police
man had to be picked up on the road to
keep him quiet. He was fixed up at the
hospital and sent back to the California
street station.
Joseph Clark and A. Anderson were
both treated at the Harbor Hospital for
dog bites yesterday. Both men were fool-
Ing with Newfoundlands and both got in
to trouble for their pains. Clark was bit
ten at 1422 Montgomery street. He teased
the dog with a piece of meat until It made
a snap and nearly took the palm of his
right hand out. Anderson was fooling
with his animal at 213 Steuart street
when it grabbed him by the right arm
and worried him. Both men were treated
at the Harbor Hospital by Dr. Cherry.

More Trouble Between Waning
Tongs Hourly Expected â Chinese
Shibboleth 13 "A Life
for a Life." #
The suspected murderer of Wong Yuen
has been arrested and last night the po
lice spent their time in an effort to ap
prehend his accomplices in the crime. The
man was taken by Sergeant of Police An
derson and Officers Foule, Carr and Ahem
in a house on Washington street. His
name is Ah Mun. He was taken to the
California-street police station and was
later placed in the tanks, pending an in
vestigation. It is probable that to-day he
will be charged with murder.
Yesterday Police Officer Foule received
information that the Chinaman who shot
the inoffensive carpenter to death at 2S&
Waverly place on Saturday night was still
In town and occupied a room in a build
ing on Washington street. That the offi
cer might not be misled, the Informer
furnished him with a diagram of the
building and gave the exact location of
the murderer's room. Foule was also
warned that the man was preparing to
leave town and might depart from the
building at any time.
Sergeant of Police Anderson was com
municated with, and in company with Po
licemen Foule, Smith and Ahem visited
the place. They climbed a labyrinth of
Btairs and succeeded in finding the room
which was indlcatea in the diagram. At
first admittance was refused them, but
the door was finally opened and the oc
cupant of the room placed under arrest.
It was found that the fellow had his
blankets all packed and was ready to
escape. He answers the description of the
man who did the shooting, and Sergeant
Anderson stated last night that there
is scarcely any doubt that he Is the man.
His name was placed on the small book
at the California-street station. He has
been in town about three days, and came
here, it is believed, as a hired murderer.
There were three men implicated in the
crime, and last evening was spent by the
police under special instructions in search
ing for the imprisoned man's companions.
Until a late hour last night no further ar
rests had been made.
Chief of Police Tobin. accompanied by
Acting Chief of Police Wittman, visited
the scene of Saturday night's crime yes
terday evening and made a thorough in
vestigation. Before departing they'de
cided that more vigorous methods must
be employed to suppress crime in the Chi
nese quarter.
More trouble Is hourly expected by the
police. Matters have come to such a con
dition that further bloodshed Is almost
unavoidable.
PROCLAMATION ISSUED.
Chinese Consul General Speaks
to His Countrymen on
*Peace.
Yesterday the Chinese Consul General
for the port of San Francisco Issued a
proclamation calling for peace among the
Chinese of this city. He urges his people
to remain quiet and threatens them with
serious interference from the Chinese Six
Companies and the Merchants' Associa
tion if they fail to do so.
The document was posted in front of the
consular residence on Stockton street, and
was read by thousands of Chinese last
night. It is as follows:
I implore my people to keep thÂ© pÂ«&ce. la
a country so far from our native land, a col
ony such as exists In San Francisco should ba
In a condition of peace. We should be as one
brother to another. There should be no more
quarreling, aa It la shameful in the eyeÂ« of
other nations.
Only two companies are engaged in the pres
ent war and this is not their first quarrel.
These men must change their ways and not
fight like wild beasts in the Jungle. If this
trouble is not settled without further blood I
will invoke the aid of the Six Companies and
the Merchants' Association and bring the of
fenders to American Justice.
BIGGEST "TRAMP" THAT HAS EVER COME TO SAN FRANCISCO.
THE largest cargo that has ever coma to San Francisco In one bottom reached port on the British tramp steamer
AiWTeTterday. The vessel Is under charter to the Pacific Mall Steamship Company, and comes here from Hong-
I koS via Yokohama and Honolulu. As soon as the United States quarantine officer boarded her the vessel was

The Algoa left Yokohama with 11.854 tons of cargo, but as 2240 tons were discharged at Honolulu she comes ! to Jth

LAND EJECTED
FROM OFFICE
Result of Sacramento
Mayoralty Contest.
Special IMspetch to The Call.
EACRAMENTO. Jan. B.â There was a
sensational scene at the City Hall a few
minute* after midnight to-night when
Mayor Cl?;ii took possession of his office.
He was accompanied by his attorneys and
two police officers and several citizens.
They found Mayor Land in possession of
the office and demande dthat he surrender
his chair. Land refused and he and his
attorneys were forcibly ejected from the
office.
On Tuesday there will corae up In the
Superior Court a suit brought by William
11. Bradley, a citizen, against Mayor-e'.ect
Clark to prevent his taking office, on the
ground that he has violated the purity of
election laws in incurring expenses of elec
tion not entered on his official statement.
Mayer Land claimed yesterday that if his
Â£ttorr.eys so advised him he would remain
*.zi the office of Mayor until the case
epalnst Clark was determined.
Apparently he received such advice to
(i:y, for he repaired to his office in the
City Hail in company with C. H. Dunn,
one of his attorneys, and there held the
fort until the midnight hour. A few
minutes after 12 o'clock Mayor-elect
Clark arrived In company with Police
Officers Michael Fisher ar.d George Nag
he!. Attorney Hir_n Johnson, School Di
rector Kay ar.d John E. Sullivan, who is
to receive Mayor Clark's appointment as
Chief of Police.
Mr. Johnson informed Mayor Land that
he should vacate the office at once; this
he refused to do. and Mayor Clark direct
ed Officers Naghel and Fisher to remove
the Mayor an- his attorney from the of
fice. The officer? placed hands on Mayor
Land and escorted him into the corridors,
where they left him. They then removed
Attorney Dunn in a similar manner.
Mayor Land protested that it was his
right to retain the office until the deter
mination of the case In court, but hi? pro
fits wpre of no avail. Mayor Clark de
tailed Officers Naghel and Fisher to keep
possession of the office until they were
reported off in the morning.
At the police station Bhortlv before 12
o'clock Mayor Land directed Sergeant
Plunkett. who is in charge of the station
at night, to take no orders except from
himself. The sergeant at almost the same
time received word from Mayor Clark that
he had detailed Officers Naghel and Fisher
for special duty.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 8, 1900.
TWO CHILD-VICTIMS
OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
Services of a Phgsiclan Refused in a
Pennsglvania Home Where Diph
theria Was Raging,
PITTSBURG. Jan. 7.-Diphtherfa and Christian Science have had a bitter
battle in a New Brighton family fcr the past two weeks. Diphtheria has won
so far. Two children are dead, while a third child and the father are danger
ously ill with the same disease.
Frank Martzolf and his wife hay* been believer* in Christian Science for
three yrars. ar.d so confirmed In the doctrine are they that they have seen
their two little ores die of malignant diphtheria, and were willing to see their
remaining child suffer rather than tak* her case "out of the hands of the
Lord." Not until forced to do so by the health authorities would the parents
permit a physician in the house, and even then the father refused to give the
medicine prescribed, and the health officials were compelled to take the fam
ily Jn charge. When the first child, Nancy, died Martzolf called on an under
taker to bury her. When asked for a certificate of death he said there was
none, ar.d Coroner Taylor began an investigation. He found the second child,
Roy. in the last stages of the disease, and ordered Dr. Boyd to treat him.
The father refused to give the boy the medicine, and he died a few hours
later. The health officials are now in charge and may be able to cave tho
ttilrd child and the father, both of whom are down with the disease.
Beaver Valley people are very much wrought up over the matter, and It Is
likely that Christian Science with Its prominent leaders in New Brighton, will
be Investigated by thÂ© courts. ' â¢ X

The school Is a branch of the University of California
and was created through the generosity of the late J. C.
Wllmerdlng. While everything la to bo free to the pupil,
It should not be considered a charity proposition any more
co than the public schools.
The instructors have been selected with a view of
Eecurlng masters at their respective trades or professions
and Include some who are considered to be the best work
men In the country.
. Everett Schwartz, a gentleman who Has made Indus
trial training his life's study, is the director. His assistants
will be as follows:
Rufus M. Grant, carpentry department; Joseph A.
I^anderville of New York, cabinet-making department:
Daniel 11. Biggs of New York, instructor In wood-carving;
Fritz Llndberg of New York, master of the forging de
partment; Felix Peano, clay molding and art; S. W. Hem

' 17 ITJI^ UT any fusa or feathers and In perfect
Vl \ V j keeping -with the practical Ideas of its founder,
W/VW the wilmerdln S School of Industrial Arts will
, xl xl be formally opened to-day. It Is expected
that the school will start with at least a hun
Â» dred ambitious youths who have determined "to make a
living with their hands with little study and plenty of
work." No speechmakinET or music will mark the begln
( nlng of practical work in the Institution. When time la
called Monday morning the pupils will be sent to work as
, though the school had been In existence for years.
Everything is in readiness. The forges In the big black
' smith shop are ready for the fires; the pressing of the
\ button which will start the electric motor will set in mo
tion the machinery in the cabinet-making and carpentry
, departments and a corps of competent instructors will be
on hand In every section of the school prepared to do Its
â¢ best, with a firm Intention of making records.
\' Those who start in the school on Monday will com
mence a five months' preliminary course. This will Include
Â» a thorough polishing In the practical studies, such as
arithmetic, history. English, etc., and a smattering of all
' the Industrial trades that are to be taught. The idea of
\ the latter part of the plan is to place the boy In a position
, at the end of the manual training course to select the

â¢ of which he can make the most success through life. When
this period Is passed the pupil will be trained in the par

Everything Is to be conducted on a practical basis.

articles to be made are to be the "real things." In the

FIRST INFANTRY
MAY COME AGAIN
TO THIS COAST
Spoken Of for the
Presidio.
TO LEAVE LEAVENWORTH
ONE POSSIBILITY IN THE SHIFT
ING OF GAKRISONS.
Acting Assistant Surgeons Becoming
Scare at the General Hospital.
Only Seven Left Out of a
Big Force.
The possibility that the headquarters
j of tho Sixth Cavalry will be. brought to
thp Presidio from Fort Riley. Kans.. is
pettinp more remote from the fact that
the commanding general of the Depart
ment of Colorjfto has requested that the
j headquarters of the Sixth Cavalry be sent
to Fort Leavenworth, also In Kansas, and
this will probably be done.
The assignment of the headquarters of
the Sixth Cavalry to. Fort Leuvenwerth
will raise another possibility, however, of
even greater Interest. The headquarters
of the old First Infantry. M long sta
tioned on this coast, are now at Fort
Leaven worth, and the ordering of the
Sixth Cavalry there instead of here may
mean that the First Is booked for here.
The First la General Shafter's old reg'
ment, and, besides. It is the only avail
able infantry headquarters in the coun
try. In view of the desire ot General
Shatter to maintain the Presidio as an
' Infantry post, the probable assignment of
the First is awakening interest. There are
many who believe, however, that Colonel
: Rawles, commanding the. Third Artillery,
now at Angel Island, will be assigned
here In default of other available officers
of infantry or cavalry.
So many acting assistant surgeons have
been drawn from the general hospital for
service In Manila that the complement of
the hospital Is now smaller than it ever
haÂ« been, and no man can be spared.
What other surgeons are sent to the Isl
ands must come from the East, or else
more must come to the hospital. There
are now only peven surgeons at the hos
pital to care for over 200 patients.

Win. Wempe Falls Among TMeves,
But He Does Not Know
Them.
TVllllam Wempe, 421 Oak street, was
seeing the sights early yesterday morn
ing, and some one relieved him of his
gold stop-watch, gold wire chain and
diamond locket. He has no recollection
of where or by whom the articles were
stolen. At least that was his statement
when he reported the matter at police
headquarters yesterday morning about 9
o'clock.
An Investigation was made and It was
ascertained that Wempe was in Jerry
McCarthy's saloon, 775 Market street,
about 6 o'clock, in the morning, and
pulled out hia watch to wind It up. Four
men. strangers to McCarthy, were In
the saloon at the time, and it 13 suspected
that they waited until Wempe came out
and then led him to a secluded spot ana
robbed him.

Sis Said Moody Was Arrested for
Murder in Montana, but Was
Acquitted After a Long
Trial.
Frank Moody, the soldier footpad, Beems
to be about as dangerous a man as can
be. It Is a wonder he did not kill two or
three people Friday night, as he went
arouna with a revolver in his hand
searching for victims.
Before he met Martin Van Haarlen, the
dry goons merchant, on Mission street,
near Tenth, and tired two shots at him,
at least two others had almost as thrilling
an experience at his hands, lie was iden
tified at the City Prison by them yester
day and two charges of assault to rob
were booked against him.
Julius Splnuler, a boy 17 years of age,
living at 57 Harriet street, was walking
home with his mother from the corner
grocery about S:3O o'clock, when they were
stopped by Moody, who had a revolver
in nis hand, lie asked the boy if he be
longed to the I'irsi caliiornia regiment,
anu the boy said "No." Tnen you are
not my friend," said Moody, ana added:
"Have you got any money?" They coy
replied that he hadn't, and, Moody getting
angry, paid: "Have you got a watch?"
to which a reply in the negative was
given.
All the time Moody kept the revolver
pointed at the boys mother, who was
trembling from fear, and the Doy said to
him: ".Don't do that; that is my moth
er." After some more words Moody al
lowed them to go. The boy left his moth
er and followed behind Moody in the hope
that he would meet a policeman, but
When he got as far as Sixth and Natoma
streets without meeting one. he returned
home. Yesterday morning the boy and
his father called at the Southern Police
Station and the boy was taken to the
prison, where he at once identified Moody.
Fred Hingsborgon. 5718 Natoma street,
about 9 o'clock Friday night, was stopped
by a soldier at Fourth and Howard
streets. The soldier had a revolver in his
hand and demanded that Hingsbergen
hand over his money on pain of being
made a corpse. Hlngsbergen thought it
was the freak of a drunken soldier and
walked away. He also called at the
prison yesterday and identified Moody. It
was also reported that Moody had at
temped to hold up other people in that
locality.
It was said yesterday that Moody was
arrested in Montana on a charge or mur
der, but was acquitted after a long trial.

Mercantile Inaugurates a Plan That
Will Be of Advantage to Coun
try B^sidenta.
The Mercantile Library has entered
upon a contract .with a literary club of
Ivos Banos, Merced County, to supply
them with a traveling library. A nucleus
of one hundred volumes Is to be always
on hand, and as many more books as they
are entitled to according to their mem
bership at the rate of two books to each
member, to be changed from time to time.
The club has furnished a charter mem
bership of twenty-eight and also a bond
of $200 for the safe keeping of the books,
and each member pays JI.DO dues every
three months. In advance. Any commu
nity in the State has this privilege under
the same conditions. This Is an ionovÂ£->

ANOTHER sensation has broken
within the Bacred precincts of the
First Christian Church of this city,
and all efforts on the part of the
church trustees to prevent the details
reaching tho ears of the members
and the general public have failed. The
news will create a great flurry In church
circles.
The sting left by the sensationalism of
the Rev. Cator Edwards Davis In the
Christian church is still fresh In the
memory of all and Its smarting has hardly
ceased when the church trustees are once
more confronted with a problem that to
keep It secret has taxed not only their
own ingenuity but that of their own
pastor, Rev. Ouy W. Smith.
Rev. Mr. Smith came from "Woodland to
take charge of the First Christian Church
last March. His welcome was the warm
est and heartiest a minister could de
sire or hope for. Of his antecedents little
was known, but It later developed that
the Rev. Mr. Smith left a wife In the
State of Nebraska. As time wore on It
was noticeable that the newly appointed
minister was apparently laboring under
some great mental strain. His sermons,
too, seemed replete with the sentimental
ity of one who In his heart's hot cells had
shut up some great secret wrong, from
which he was suffering, and which he had
vowed would never bo disclosed by his
lips.
Some weeks ago a sermon by Rev. Mr.
Smith attracted particular attention and
comment. It was an ancient textâ "The
bed Is too short and the covering too
narrow." In that discourse the preacher,
with suppressed emotion, said there are
many people making a bed for themselves
on which they try to stretch, but the
covering being too narrow discloses their
deeds, their social, political or their re
ligious condition.
The comment excited at the time has
revealed that the young preacher has a
wife on the other side of the Rockies, taljt
the couple have lived separate and apart
for some time. '
Some months ago, In the Superior Court
of Alameda County, a suit for divorce
was filed by G. W. Smith against Laura
M. Smith. Fred Wood drew up the com
plaint and a decree was asked on the
statutory ground of desertion.
This simple record elicited no curiosity
at the time, for the Smiths, even with

The New Order of the Ages.
The Universal Brotherhood of the The
osophical Society held its regular week
ly meeting last night in the hall of the
Academy of Sciences on Market street.
The subject was "The New Order of
Ages," and the lecture was delivered by
Rev. Allen Griffiths. His discourse was
a treatment of the subject of the bear
ing a man's own acts and Inclinations
had on the future happiness of the Indi
vidual. The speaker said that not only
was the power to do right given to every
human being, but his ability to fulfill
that obligation rested entirely with him
self. The man who had the strength,
energy and manhood to pursue the proper
course w-as sure of success, while the
sluggard would fall as far behind his
realization of the good things spiritual
as the^ earthly sluggard would miss the
enjoyment of all that was best in this
world. The address was excellent and
well delivered. At Us conclusion the
usual discussion and questions and an
swers were entered into by those of the
audience who were so inclined.

a year ago. His tactics are distinctive.
Body blows are his favorite method of
attack. He Is tireless, swift as a tiger
and crafty. He will take a blow if he
sees an opportunity to land one in re
turn. He prefers to deliver a volley of
short-arm blows over the heart In a mix
up rather than resort to wild swings to
the head.
He has won the majority of his fights
In two rounds or under, and this when he
has met opponents eligible for the cham
pionship class. His wonderful showing in
this respect has made him a strong
favorite in the betting. He opened at 2 to
1, but this was too tempting an offer" to
be resisted by Dixon's friends and the
colored boy has gradually advanced in
favor until 10 to 7 and 10 to 8 Is nearer his
true price now. Owing to McGovern's
well-known ability as a hard hitter a lot
of money is being wagered on the length
of the fight. McGovern's adherents are
apparently willing to wager any amount
of money the bout will not last four
rounds. This is remarkable, as Dlxon is

OAKLAND, Jan. 7.â Chief of Police
Ilodgkins and the detectives have been
working all day on a holdup reported by
G. W. PrescotU Prescott, who Is about
39 years old, resides with his father at 4Â«S
Moss avf-nue. lie asserts that shortly
before 11 o'clock last night, after he had
allghir-d from a Telegraph-avenue car
and while he was walking toward his
home, a shadow suddenly fell across his
nath. The. next Instant he received a
blow on his mouth that felled him to the
FidVwalk. When he regained conscious
ness he found that he had been relieved
of 53 and Fome Fmall change. As a result

ha* learrst-d the name of a man who pre

the G. W. prefixes,- are as numerous as
the sands by the sea, but It develops now
that this particular G. W. Smith Is no
other than the Rev. Guy W. Smith, pas
tor of the First Christian Church, and
the grounds are In reality different from
those recorded.
One of the sensational features of the
case Is that of a discovery made by the
couple that they were cousins in some
degree. It Is said that the discovery so
preyed upon the consciences of them both
that the wife deserted her ministerial
husband, and the hnsband also left the
once happy scenes where five years ago
he had led to the altar Laura May
Drummond. one of the most popular
belles in Nebraska society. Every effort
has been put forth to keep the sensation
al discovery of the unfortunate relation
ship a tight secret, not only for its un
pleasant and Inevitable pain-provoking
details, but owing, as well, to the prom
inence of the parties and their relatives.
Mr. Smith's father was Attorney General
in Nebraska at one time, and at another
time counselor for the Chicago, Burling
ton and Qulncy Railroad.
The secret, however, was divulged by
Smith himself some time ago, when In
all Christian faith and candor as a man
and minister -he called together the trus
tees of his church and poured out his
heart to them. He deemed It unchristian
to further withhold the secret, and not
lust to allow the matrimonial bond to
hold together two souls that could never
again dwell In peaceful union.
The young minister at this meeting ap
prised his church trustees of his Inten
tion to commence 'divorce proceedings.
At the same time he presented his resig
nation. This was taken under considera
tion. Then two members received let
ters from the minister's wife, wherein
she declares that "I hold no feeling of
reproach against him. He is blameless,
and his life has been good and pure. My
only prayer Is that God may most abun
dantly blees his labors."
The church trustees finally declined to
accept the resignation, and regarded It
to the best interests of all concerned
that the divorce suit be brought and the
unhappy matrimonial relationship be
tween the minister and his wife bo termi
nated as soon as possible.
When questioned at his home on Syca
more street this evening regarding the
divorce suit. Mr. Smith expressed great
surprise that the secret was out. Being
pressed, he admitted he was the plaintiff
in the divorce suit, but as to the grounds
he begged to be excused from any dis
cussion of the affair. When asked point
blank as to the truth of the discovery
of the cousin relationship, he offered no
denial. "You will pardon me If I do not
care to discuss the matter." he said. "I
will only say that It was all revealed
after our marriage. Some time after we
were united conditions were brought to
light that rendered It an unfortunate ne
cessity that this action should be
brought."
Cralgle Sharp, one of the church trus
tees, was also seen. "We have had a lot
of bad luck," he said. "Now there was
that Davis affair. Well, we couldn't
help that, and we abhor sensation. We
have been trying to get a new start. It
Is true, though, that the oftlclal board
held a meeting to hear our pastor, and
he has told us all. He tendered his resig
nation, but we refused to accept it. "We
know that he is Justified In his course,
and we have tried to keep the affair quiet
and do not wish to discuss It."
Although the complaint In the divorce
suit was tiled on November 25, 1899. no an
swer has as yet been filed, and It Is likely
that the defendant's default will be en
tered In a few days and the case sub
mitted to the court commissioner for the
purpose of taking, testimony.
Sympathizes With Roberts.
OAKLAND, Jan. 7.â ln his sermon to
day Rev. Mr. Smith declared that Con
gressman-elect Roberts of Utah was mor
ally far superior to many of the members
of the national legislature who are en
deavoring to oust him from that body.
There was a large congregation present
and the utterances in defense of the Mor
mon representative created somewhat of
a sensation. He said:
In the main I think the fight against Robert*
Is right, yet the basis of It Is all wrong. He
1b living a domestic life which the people hava
declared to be Illegal, yet he is doing It openly,
and so far Â»s morality Is concerned he Is
doing right. Many of his Congressional col
leagues are doing the same thing, practically,
only they have mistresses where he has wives.
They know that their mode of living Is wrong
and ore acting against the dictate* of thetr
consciences.
Roberts, on the contrary, Is acting according
to his conscience and his belief. He la doing
openly what they do under cover. So far as
the life of the man Is concerned from a moral
standpoint he Is far superior to the men who
do such things covertly.
Congress has a right to refuse him a seat,
but in doing so the members are straining at
a gnat and swallowing a camel. I am not
defending Roberts, but want to point out the
condition of morals among the people gen
erally. If they should expel all the Congress
men sruilty of the same thing there would
probably be a great many vacant seats In the
legislative hall of the nation.

NAUGHT TO BREAK
THE DEEP GLOOM
OF DISASTER
British Public Face to Face
With a Crisis in the South
African War.
LONDON. Jan. T.â The British publlo
Is at last face to face with a. critical
moment in the campaign. It may safely
be said that at no previous time has
there been such anxious hours of sus
pense as will be passed through until the
arrival of further news regarding the
fate of Ladysmith. The week opens with
only fresh additions to the disasters that
have befallen British arms, and there is no
longer any sustaining confidence to buoy
up public opinion. The editorials this
morning fully reflect the extreme gravity
of the situation, with a painful under
current of ominous forebodings, mainly
caused by the fact that, while the Boers
have now changed their tactics and as
sumed the offensive. General Buller Is ap
parently unable to do more to assist Gen
eral White than make a demonstration.
The Morning Post says:
"He might as well have ordered a dis
play of fireworks."
As the heliograph ceased working yes
terday (Sunday) It Is presumed that Gen
eral White's last message was sent by a
pigeon or runner. Its purport Is serious
enough. The Times publishes a dispatch
from Ladysmith, dated January 1, record-
Ing two nights' movements on the part
of the Boers to assault the town. These
had to be abandoned when the British de
fenses were reached, but the correspond-
ent says It was aparent that the great at
tack would not be long delayed, ile
adds:
"Loyally supported by the civilians the
garrison can hold out for a considerable
period. We are not reduced to half ra
tions. The greatest difficulty Is hospital
accommodation for the wounded and
elck."
The War Office has already decided
upon Immediate steps for sending an
Eighth Infantry division to South Africa.
Some of the regiments for this division
will be taken from Gibraltar and Malta,
They will be replaced by militia.
It Is asserted that the customs authori
ties on the River Thames have detained
two outgoing steamers and seized two
large guns and six Maxims packed In
piano cases, intended for the Transvaal.
It Is also said that a quantity of food
stuffs on another vessel has been seized.

A Gold Leaf for Dr. Titus.
Dr. Frank H. Titus, formerly Superin
tendent of the City and County Hospital.
j has been honored by President McKinley.
who has sent his name to the Senate for
promotion to the rank of major of volun
teers in the medical department of the
United States army. Dr. Titus was among
the first of the San Fraucl3co medical
men who volunteered for service In the
army at the time that war was declared
against Spain. His application was for
warded to Washington, where Surgeon
General Sternberg placed It on tile.
As soon as the army was sent to Ma
nila Dr. Titus was appointed on one of
the first vessels that left this port with
the volunteers. His services In Cavlta
were of such a character as to call for
extra recommendation from the authori
ties In the Philippines. The President
recognized these services and as soon as
the Senate met he placed Dr. Titus' name
among the the first batch of appointments
for a major's commission. The fortunate
I recipient of these honors is in this city at
' the present time, under orders to sail on
the transport Tartar in the course of a
few days. Previous to Dr. Titus' manage
ment of the County Hospital he was resi
dent physician of St. Luke's Hospital,
.where he made a creditable record for
himself. Mrs. Tlttta Is at present In tnÂ«
only a few moments, but the police have
been unable to locate this man.

of the Yale freshmen.

A<i<-,!ph ninth, a bartender for Theodore
der, dead this morning and the

| eaaer of liquors was a lieutenant in the i
German army. The funeral will be held
â¢Jndpr the auspices of the D^utscher Krei
fr Ver*>Jn, a German organization similar
to the Grand Army in this" country.

o'clock this morning, acompanied by John

Hooped over to pick up the morning pa
;> p rs, when he fell forward.
"I've got a terrible pain In my h^nd and
i m dying-." he remarked to Ruther, as
Ruth^r picked the stricken man up and
placed him on a chair.
Biuth then lapsed Into uncon*ciou?n*>ss
2nd died before medical aid could be
Â«-alk-d. The body was taken to the

f^ovn jreara, with the exception of two
years, vrfaea he went back to Germany

"Bluth never became a citizen of this
country," paid Martin Peu-rs of the Oak

German army up to nix months ago. and
hrld the rank of lieutenant. He was in
the reserves nnd was here on furlough un
til his term of enlistment expired, when
he was honorably discharged. His family
is a prominent one In the old country.
One of his brothers is chief of construc
tion of public buildings in Berlin. Another
brother Is a German colonel, while a third
Is a major of cavalry in the German
army."
The cause of death is supposed to have

time and this '- thought to be the pri
mary cause. The deceased was well known
'. mong the German population and leaves
many friends.

Philippines Rich in Minerals.
W. M. Thornton, ex-Mayor of Ana
conda, Mont., and brother of Attorney
Crittenden Thornton of this city, is a
guest at the Palace, where ho arrived a
short time ago from the Orient. Mr.
Thornton denies the report that he went
out to the Philippines in the interest of
a large Eastern syndicate whose object
was to secure control of some of the rich
mining properties of Luzon. He says his
trip was one of pleasure and but little
else. Mr. Thornton does say, however,
that our new possessions are teeming
with all sorts of mineral deposits, which
will prove of immense value as soon as
the political coi.dition of the islands be
comes settled enough to permit of their
being worked. At present the Insurrec
tion in progress there precludes any one
venturing into the interior, let alone at
tempting to develop any mining or other
business Industry. \
SUNDAY AT THE PARK.
Musical Programme Was Dispensed
Withâ At the Chutes and Baths.
There was no music at the park yester
day, and in consequence the crowd was
small. No accidents occurred during the
day to disturb the police and a general
spirit of quiet prevailed. Emll Marke
berg made a balloon ascension at the
Chutes late in the afternoon, the event be
ing witnessed by several thousand peo
ple The ascension, coupled with the
inanv other attractions, brought a big
crowd to the popular place of amusement
and the day was passed without special
incident. Following are tho results of the

LIPTON'S CHALLENGE.
Sir Thomas to Investigate Various
Models Before Proceeding.
LONDON. Jan. 7.â Sir Thomas Liplon.
it is understood, will defer action regard
ing another challenger for the America's
cup until the Distant Shore and another
yacht now In ' course of construction,
according to designs by Watson, have
been completed for C. D. Rhodes.
Experts say that the Distant Shore will
be an improvement upon the Britannia
and the Meteor, and that the designs are
much like those of the Herreshoff mas
terpieces. It is noted as curious that
Messrs. Herreshoff and Watson should
not have known they have been working
on similar lines.
The Distant Shore's water line will be
two feet shorter than the Britannia's, but
her sail area will be larger.
GEORGE DIXOX. the hero of more
notable ring battles than any
other boxer the world has known,
will meet Terry McGovern to
morrow night in New York. It Is
the meeting of a seasoned veteran and a
youngster who has had a meteoric career.
Dlxon is conceded to be the greatest
boxer of his inches that ever lived, while
McGovern has astonished followers of
the game by the expeditious manner in
which he has defeated a formidable list
of men since his first appearance hardly
noted as a defensive fighter, and, having
made a study of McGovern's ring tactics,
should not succumb so soon If at aJI. In
all his years In the ring he was nearly
knocked out but once. In this the "Ken
tucky Rosebud" landed a chance blow,
and dilnculty was experienced In bring
ing Dixon around in time. In his time ha
has fought men of all weights and styles
and has made a brilliant showing. He
announces this as his last ring engage
ment, win or lose. If defeat be his por
tion he will have a host of sympathizers
wherever the English language la spoken.

COLUMBIA MARKSMEN.
Weather Conditions Caused
Poor Shooting at Harbor
View Range.
The heavy downpour of rain early yes
terday morning caused a number of mem
bers of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club
to believe that there would be little shoot
tngf on the opening of the programme of
the season at the Harbor View range. Aa
the sun came out so did the members, and
by evening the majority had put in their
appearance with the firearms of their
choice. No very brilliant shooting was
done on account of unfavorable conditions.
The. light was varying to an annoying de
gree and the range itself was literally
afloat. The markers' pits on the 200-yard
rifle range were filled with wa.ter. makin-
It necessary to build platforms for the
markers.
Onaccount of the difficulties In marking
the rifle class medal contests were post
poned to the next regular shoot Slors
revolvers were out than have been seen
on the range for years, on account of a
number of valuable prizes having been
offered on this class of matches. The
scores of the day. Columbia target ten

PROPOSALS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 8, 1900.
this city has been changed from the 13th
to the 20th inst., and the place selected is
Odd Fellows' Assembly Hall, on Seventh
street.
The following circular has been Issued
from the office of the grand keeper of the
records and seal. Herman Schaffner:
"California in 1902 means that the Su-
preme Lodge must hold its biennial con-
vention of that year in our 'land of sun-
shine, fruit and flowers.' California in 1902
means a revivifying of the order not only
In our own State (domain), but throughout
the entire Pacific Slope. California in 1902
means the infusion of new life, renewed
energy, increased interest and growth in
the membership of the order. California in
1902 means inoculation with the Pythian
virus that makes the order in the domains
over the 'Great Divide' the standard fra-
ternal organization. So, for the 'good of
the order,' it must be California in 1902.''

was supposed we would do, we must ad
here to the spirit of the charter and keep
all members In good standing in their po
sitions without examination or investiga
tion."
When asked whether or not he consid
ered ex-Chief of Police I. W. Lees a mem
ber of the department under this provi
sion of the charter, he said:
"No! I do not consider Mr. Lees a mem
ber of the department at the present time.
His resignation and the action of the
Board of Police Pension Commissioners
has thoroughly established his standing
and he is no longer a member of the de
partment in my opinion."
Mr. Newhall further stated that he was
puzzled over the provision of the charter
giving the commission the right to ap
point police matrons to care for female
prisoners. "Although providing for the
appointment of the matrons," said Mr.
Newhall, "the charter does not fix their
salaries, and immediately following this
provision is one fixing the salary of a
police surgeon. Whether or not we have
the right to appoint the matrons and fix
their salaries Is a question worthy of dis
cussion. A hundred such questions con
front us. but notwithstanding this fact,
the people will be pleased when we meet
to-morrow."
After reflecting a moment Mr. New
hall, referring to the coming new Chief,
said that he had met Mr. de Young, who
asked him what he was going to do in
regard to filling the now vacant office of
Chief of the department- . "I told him,
as I now tell you." said Mr. Newhall,
"that as yet I was undecided; that I
had not settled upon a choice, and per
haps would not until I had discussed the
matter further with . the other members
0* the commission and had had more op
portunity to reflect upon the matter. Tne
office to be filled is a responsible one,
and as I am partly responsible for who
ever may be given the oflice I want to
feel my way carefully and not mako a
break at the outset."
Notwithstanding Mr. Newhall's state
ment. It is known that he is pledged to
vote for Esola for Chief of Police, as was
told in The Call a few days ago.
subterfuge, Maxwell's adherents Insisted
upon their case and recalled to the ex
ecutive mind that so far as names were
concerned none at all had been men
tioned; that he had simply guaranteed not
to disturb the department. Phelan, how
ever, declined to meet the issue with any
positive statement of his Intentions, and
until Saturday it was not known just what
course he would take. Then, however,
sufficient facts were obtained to make it
certain that he proposed to keep his sec
ond contract and seat Gorman. Mr. Max
well and his friends promptly retained
Attorney McEnerney, and to-day or to
morrow he will be prepared to file his
suit.
Mr. MpEnerney proposes to use the
charter Itself to force Phelan to make
good his promises. The complaint will set
forth that Maxwell has served the de
partment well and faithfully for twenty
years and that the charter provides spe
cifically that no officers In the depart
ment may be removed save for Incompe
tency or neglect of duty.
Maxwell and his friends are fighting
with a double purpose; primarily to main
tain Mr. Maxwell in his position, second
arily to keep the 60-calfed reform or
ganization strictly to the letter and spirit
of the charter and prevent them from
using that Instrument as a political club
with which to beat their way to absolute
and perennial supremacy. Mr. Mc-
Enerney is confident that the charter will
prevent the double-handed, game the
Mayor Is attempting to work, and he
points out that, unless incompetency and
neglect can be proved against his client,
he cannot be removed. As Maxwell's
name has never been brought to dis
credit or his ability questioned, there is
little chance that he can or will be thrown
out.
NEW POLICE COMMISSIONERS
TO ORGANIZE AT NOON TO-DAY
NEW CHAPTER GOES
INTO EFFECT TO DAY.
ters of Oakland's dry goods establish
ments. They had learned that the great
State of New York insisted that "mer
chants provide seats for their lady clerks
in all stores and shops wherever possi
ble." and not desiring to wait for relief un
til California's Legislature met, they ap
pealed to the ladies of their city to take
up the crusade for their suffering sisters
and make a local law by common consent
and the force of their own arguments.
They went further, and suggested that
If the women of the State would refuse
to trade with merchants who did not en
ter Into the spirit of the agitation, the
flght would be won without striking a
blow or awaiting tho Blowly grinding
mills of the law.
That was but a few days ago. Now,
sections 5 and 6, chapter V, statutes of
California, ISSa, is the liveliest law on the
books. All that is lacking to maKe it use
ful is a disposition on the part of the La
bor Commissioner to enforce it, and make
his official position something more than
a tax-eatinf political "soft snap."
Unfortunately for the shop girls and
the lady clerks. Labor Commissioner F. V.
Meyers has not startled the community
with vis activity, but prominent women
all over the State are putting their heads
together, discussing the resolutions adopt-
Ed by the Mothers* Union of Golden Gate
and are preparing for action. Mr. Meyers
will hear irom them later. If ho does
not find himself a big enough man to
grasp the situation he will have cause for
regret.
Governor Gage's appointee to the office
of Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics learned of the "seat law" about
two weeks ago, and it was an Oakland
woman who "put him wise." She had a
relative working in one of the stores of
the Athens, whose health was becoming
undermined because she was forced by
a tyrannical employer to remain on her
feet during working hours at times when
there was not a customer in the store.
Mr. Meyers Investigated the case and
found the situation as stated. He asked
the storekeeper if he would "please" pro
vide his lady clerks with chairs. The pro
prietor said that ho would think about It,
and there the matter ended, so far as Mr.
Meyers is concerned. He admits that he
received information no later than last
Saturday that the Oakland storekeeper
had wot complied with the law, but he
has not evinced any Intention of forcing
him to obey. This is not the only
case of the kind in the city across the
bay. Mr. Meyers says so himself, but he
has done nothing to bring about a change.
He believes that the law Is being obeyed
In San Francisco, for the reason that no
one has complained to him. His office is
at 927 Market street, room 326, where he
whiles away the time waiting for some
tired lady clerk to register a "kick"
against her employer. When this happens
the Labor Commisioner Is going to do
something. But he does not expect any
thing of the kind to occur, for, he says,
any woman who would complain of her
employer would stand a mighty good
chance of losing her situation.
Mr. Meyers offers many excues for hl3
inactivity, but he fails to suggest a single
feasible reasonâ and there is a vast differ
ence between an excuse and a reason.
In an interview yesterday Mr. Meyers
said :
"This department should not be blamed
for the conditions as they exist in regard
to the lady clerks. It is impossible, with
the means at our command, to create a
patrol system to see that the storekeepers
WOULD SETTLE
THEIR SCORE
WITH BLOOD
Another Shooting in
Chinatown.
Fan Chat, a butcher residing at 841
Washington street, was shot In the right
hip by Yuen Sing and Hoy Tong as he
passed out of the Jackson-street theater
on to Washington alley about 1 o'clock
this morning. The shooting Is supposed
to have been done by members of the Hop
Sing Tong, who sought to avenge the
death of three of their members at the
hands of the Suey Sings.
According to the statement of Jim Mc-
Millln, a witness, who stood on the corner
of Jackson street and Washington alley,
the two highbinders lay In wait for their
victim on the steps leading to a basement
near the entrance of the playhouse. When
Fan Chat passed out of the place they al
lowed' him to walk six feet from where
they were stationed, and then they fired
simultaneously. One bullet struck the
butcher in the right hip and the other
missed him.
He fell to the sidewalk with a scream
of pain, and the men who attempted to
kill him made a desperate attempt to es
cape.
The two rushed in the direction of
Washington street, and one entered the
Washington alley entrance to the corner
house. The other escaped around on
\vashlngton street and entered the same
building.
The shot attracted the attention of James
and George Downey, special policeman,
and other officers. Some of the police fol
lowed the first man into the place, and
others who were on Washington street
were close on the trail of the second high
binder. The two would-be murderers came
together where the halls in the place
meet, and noting the approach of the of
ficers attempted to hide their guns. One,
which was afterward found by the onicers,
had been deposited in an ash barrel. One
shot had been fired from it.
The men were taken prisoners and sent
to the Central Police Station. Fan Chat's
injuries may prove fatal If the bullet
has entered the abdominal cavity, but It
Is not yet known If It has.
WOMEN UNITE
TO HELP THE
SHOP GIRLS
RcsolutTons of the Mothers'
Union Find Many Sup
porters.
AWAY back In ISS9, when a law was
enacted requiring shopkeepers to
provide seats for their female em
ployes, it was the intention that
it should be enforced. The pas
sage of the act was the result of agita
tion started by women who sympathized
with their sex and believed that the
saleslady and the shop girl were deserv
ing of humane treatment. The Commis
sioner of Labor was the official dslgnated
to carry out the provisions of the law,
and when the idea was new and the
women who had started the crusade were
watching him, he saw to it that when
tired shop girls were not actually en
gaged In the work for which they were
employed, they were provided with a com
fortable seat on which to rest their weary
bodies.
The better class of storekeepers were
not antagonistic to the law. Experience
taught them that their employes worked
more cheerfully and that their services
were more valuable when they were
treated as the law directed. But like a
great many provisions of the statutes, in
activity on the part of ofllcials paid to
enforce them, relegated the law to the
graveyard.
The statute was forgotten. The girls
who worked In stores stood up during the
hours of service, and the derelict official
continued to draw his pay just the same.
The girls remembered the law, but not
one of them dared register a complaint
for fear that the penalty would bo her
dismissal.
It remained for the Mothers' Union of
Golden Gate to renew the fight so suc
cessfully waged in 18S9. So little had been
done toward enforcing the California law
that the union did not even know of Its
existence. Their attention had been at
tracted by the wan faces of the unfor
tunate shop girls and the tired expres
sions of the lady clerks behind the coun-

snch barbarism. She also believed that
men should be allowed to sit down.
"I have often wondered, said Mrs.
Ames, "why a petition was not started to
compel proprietors to look after the wel
fare of their salesmen and saleswomen. It
would be wise on their part to furnish
these necessary comforts, as attentions
of this kind would, in my opinion, ma^e
employes strive all the harder to advance
the employer's Interests. I would like to
see Just such a law as was passed by the
New York Legislature put In force in this
State. It Is a humane enactment, for it
tends to lessen the. hardships endured by
those who are compelled to stand on Their
feet for hours in order to earn their live
lihood." 'Â¦ Â¦
Mrs. Jewett, a leading member of the
California Club, is a firm believer in the
action taken by the Oakland ladles. She
will also add her views at the board meet
ing of the organization this morning
when the matter Is brought up for discus
sion Without a moment's hesitation Mrs.
Jewett pronounced the action of the Moth
ers' Union proper. She has always savored
the reform that would brighten the life
of the toilers of her sex. and was gratified
to read of others working In the same dl
"I am certainly In favor of having the
merchants furnish their employes with
seats behind the counters," she said. "It
is not only helpful to the young women
who stand on their feet, but it Is an en
couragement to them to know that their
comforts are being looked after. A short
rest during the busy day places them In
a better condition to work, and in the end
the employer is the gainer. I am surprised
that proprietors of dry goods stores have
not added this Innovation. Instead of wait-
Ing until Its need is pointed out to their."
All this has a cheering sound and leads
to the belief that the shop girls* morning
greeting In the near future will be: "La

obey the law. I will certainly give atten
tion to every complaint that Is made to
me and will prosecute where the offender
refuses to obey the law, but the difficulty
is In getting the empolyes to complain to
us. They fear that if they do so they
will lose their situations, and rather than
run the risk they prefer to endure their
sufferings in silence. I have dropped Into
several stores In San Francisco and I
have not noticed anything that would
give cause for complaint."
Mr. Meyers probably does not forget to
draw his pay whenever It Is due. He Is
certainly paid for doing something. The
law provides that "it shall be the duty
of the Commissioner of the Bureau of La
bor Statistics to enforce the provisions of
this act," referring to sections 5 and 6
of chapter V. Mr. Meyers might consti
tute a very useful patrol all by himself
if he did not find his office chair so com
fortable and the surroundings of his
apartments at 927 Market street so ex
tremely attractive as to demand most of
his official attention.
But the lady clerks need not despair.
Stronger agencies are working in their be
half than the Incumbent of a political of
fice. The appeal of the Mothers' Union
has been answered. Prominent ladles of
this side of the bay have taken up the
subject and considerably more than dis
cussion will characterize their actions.
The California Club, one of the represent
ative women's organizations of the city,
will take the matter up to-day at a meet
ing of the board. Prominent ladles all
over the city express a determination to
lend their assistance to the crusade and
make the fight for the lady clerks a win
ning one.
While some of them arÂ© loth to place
themselves on record, they heartily favor
the reform that will tend to lighten the
burdens of the members of their sex
who are compelled to gain their liveli
hood in the capacity of saleswomen.
Mrs. E. B. Pond, wife of the ex-Mayor
and prominent in slclal circles; said:
"I have noticed wherever I have gone
In this city that the girls are allowed
to sit down. They seem to be well taken
care of and are happy and contented. I
don't believe In interfering with the
merchants if they try to do what is
right, but If the men who conduct stores
In Oakland do not permit their sales
women to rest when not busy I hope
they will Bee their mistake and will fol
low the example of local merchants and
provide seats for their employes."
Mrs. Lovell White, president of the
California Club, stated that she would
bring the matter before the organization
at its session this morning. She stated
that she read the resolutions adopted by
the ladles across the bay and approved
their action. In part she said:
"The California Club will discuss the
matter at Its board meeting to-day. I
think it unwise to begin any reform until
you have thoroughly Investigated the
situation. Seats are provided for the
saleswomen of this city. The merchants
are our friends and should not be criti
cized unless they deserve it. If the Oak-
DISMISSAL IS THE
PRICE OF RESTING
FOR the past three years Mrs.
John Pettee has labored early
and late in behalf of the
young women who are com
pelled to earn their livelihood be
hind the counters of the dry-goods
stores of thl3 city. Aa a member
of the Vigilante Society she made
a personal tour of the stores and
Investigated the condition of the
young women employed. Upon
reading the resolutions adopted
by the Mothers' Union she said
the merchants of San Francisco
were as much to blame as their
brethren In Oakland. .>.
"I know scores of young girls
working for small salaries," she
said, "who after their day's work
are unable to move because of the
terrible pains they suiter, due to
being compelled to stand on their
feet for hours at a stretch. Their
employers have obeyed the letter
of the law by placing seats be
hind the counters, but It would
be worth a girl's position If she
were caught sitting down."
land business men are not humane enough
to provide resting places for their em
ployes, their attention ought to be called
to this neglect of their employes' health
and comfort."
Mrs. Samuel G. Murphy, wife of the
president of the First National Bank. Is
of the opinion that if seats are provided
for the young women who are employed
in the various establishments It would
be conducive to their health and comfort.
In speaking on the resolutions adopted
by the Mothers' Union she said:
"I was greatly surprised to learn that
dry -goods stores did not provide proper
comforts for their female employes. To
my mind it Is inhumane for the pro
prietors not to allow their saleswomen to
sit down during business hours. It would
be materially to their comfort and tend
to lengthen their lives if the girls so em
ployed were given seats to rest during
their weary hours of toil.* I was always
of the opinion that all dry-goods stores
looked after the health and comfort of
their employes, but judging by the stand
taken by the Mothers' Union the mer
chants are lax in their methods. I hope
that the defect will be remedied."
Mrs. Pelham Ames said it was an out
rage that seats were not given to the
girls employed In dry goods establish
ments. She thought that if an employer
was so Inhumane. as not to furnish the
necessary resting places for his help they
ought to take courage and revolt against
POLICE Commissioners Blggy. New
hall and Thomas paid a visit to
the City Hall yesterday and In
spected tne several branches of the
police department.
Dr. McNutt, the fourth member of the
board, was unable to accompany his fel
low Commissioners on their tour on ac
count of a pressing business engagement.
After familiarizing themselves with the
workings of the department the Com
missioners, out of courtesy, called on
Mayor Phelan. An Informal discussion
about police matters was then held, but
no definite action was taken.
The Commissioners will meet at noon
to-day. After organizing and formally
taking possession of the records and doc
uments of the old board, they will adjourn
until Wednesday evening, when it is prob
able they will elect a successor to I. W.
Lees. Esola's friends claim they have
the flght won. Thc-y unreservedly assert
that he will receive the appointment by
a unanimous vote of the board. Captain
"VVittman's supporters are hoping for a
deadlock. "Wlttman, he of the cold feet,
wiÂ»l then be entered In the race, with no
chance of success. Commissioner Newhall,
when seen last night, said:
"It is not true that we have taken a
ballot with the object of determining
which candidate has the most supporters.
The other members of the commission
agree with me that we have no legal right
to select a Chief of Police until we have
taken our seats, and for this reason we
have refrained from discussing the mat
ter. However, we will have something to
give you to-morrow, which no doubt will
please the public.
"A matter which has occasioned con
siderable discussion among the members
of the board Is that clause of the charter
providing for all "members of the police
force' in good standing at the time the
new commission takes office to retain
their positions without civil service ex
amination. It Is my opinion that instead
or organizing a new department, as
TO-DAT or to-morrow Garret W.
McEnerney, as counsel, will file suit
against the newly appointed Fire
Commission to compel that body to
keep one of Mayor Phelan' s numer
ous and broken pre-election pledgee
by retaining George Maxwell In the
secretaryship of the department.
At that time In the late campaign when
the Mayor felt the need of votes strong
upon him he called In the political man
agers of the fire brigade, and after much
dickering gave, in return for Its voting
strength, his guarantee that If elected he
would not disturb the present Fire De
partment.
Later, as the gama got hotter, Mr.
Phelan was compelled to "talk business"
with other Interests controlling large
blocks of votes, and notwithstanding his
cast-iron promise to the fire officials he
wound up by promising to unseat George
Maxwell, the secretary of the commission,
and put In his place Joseph C. Gorman,
ex-secretary of the State Board of Exam
iners.
A short time ago Maxwell came Into
Information which led him to suspect that
Mayor Phelan was going to give him the
double cross. His friends called upon the
executive and reminded him of the prom
ise he had made before election, but he at
tempted to avoid the Issue. He was final
ly forced to announce himself definitely,
however, and claimed that in the bar
gain that was struck Maxwell's name had
not been mentioned.

tion San Francisco's brand-new munici
pal machinery will take the offices and
records of their predecessors at that
hour. Incidental to the setting In motion
of tho very complicated mechanism
there is always more or less friction,
end the setting up of the charter bids
lair to be no exception to the rule. In
fact it will likely require tho best ef
forts cf Mayor Phelan and tho assistance
of several squads of police and & couple
of court* of proper Jurisdiction to put it
cu'etly and peaceably into effect.
Just wliat are to be the results of char
ter rule cannot, of course, be foretold.
The changes are radical in every depart
ment, and even the veterans in toe sci
ence of municipal government will have
some trouble in harmonizing their new
duties. The charter, or rather the ap
pointments made by Mayor Phelan under
Its provisions, have already resulted in a
markej change in. the geographical lines
of the city. The line between "New San
Francisco" and the old town Is plainly
drawn, as can be seen by a casual pe
rusai of his Honor's list of Commission
ers. Under the consolidation act San
Francisco consisted of everything within
the county line. As Indicated by the
Mayor's appointments, the new city con
cists of only that section of the town
north of the Market street cable slot. In
the commissions or out of them the dis
trict south of the new dividing lino has
but one representative, Keuben H. Lloyd,
appointed to the Park Commission, and
ilr. Lloyd's duties are co numerous that
iie is obliged to spend the greater portion
of his time at the Pacific Union Club,
and is able to get south among his con
6tituer.ts only infrequently.
To-day will be marked with no blare of
trumpets or any touching ceremonial, but
there will be no dearth of Interesting in
cident for the entertainment of those who
4jo out to see the new dawn breait over
the City liall. The Board of Health per
sists in its contention that it is a State
body a.nci outside the jurisdiction of the
charter. It proposes to prove its conten
tion by declining to give over Its office
to its successor. Mayor Phelan. on the
other hand, proposes to prove its Â«rror
â¢with the assistance of a hijuaa ol ponce,
which he has notitied to be on hand this
morning. Tax Collector Sheehan also pro
poses toftgiii and to Keep Joseph H. Scott,
bis successor, out of office. He hats barri
caded all of the doors, changed the locks,
removed the door knobs and bolted down
every window, so that it cannot be opened
â¢waui a crowbar.
All day yesterday he and a score of his
employes were at work turning his offices
into an arsenal and removing the official
records out of the reach of Scott and
every one else. Last ni^ht he and his
men remained all night locked up in the
oflice, watched from the outside by
Scott's newly appointed attaches. Scott
proposes to take possession of the office
to-day at noon, no matter what the cost,
and as a preliminary step last night sent
the following letter to Mayor Phelan:

to do this with the rank and file of the
party, whom he ignored In the general
distribution of favors, tho Mayor had
started Fay out through the city and was
offering to each of the eighteen Assembly
districts four positions at the City Hall
under the charter government. In all Fay
was given seventy-two places to dole out
as an inducement to get back Into line
and quit kicking. Just where the Mayor
got them all cannot be determined, if the
Mayor observed hia declaration that he
proposes to squarely enforce the civil ser
vice law.
There are not that many positions out
side the Fire Department which are ex
empt from the civil service rule, and if
each district is to get a parcel of four
places the successful candidates in the
civil service examinations will have to win
out in remarkable divisions to meet thÂ«
Mayor's programme.
Whether or not the newly appointed
commissioners have consented to the
Mayor's plan is not known, but it is haxd
ly probable when it is considered that the
seventy-two positions he proposes to hand
out will leave nothing at all at their dis
posal; and nearly all of them have made
more promises than they could hope to
fulfill. Notwithstanding these questions,
however. Fay is already doing the city
and passing out "bunches of four" right
and left, the only consideration being that
the "kicks" chall cease and every one get
back Into line and whoop matters up for
civil service and civic reform.
