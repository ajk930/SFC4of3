Catholic and well known as an author and

LONDON, Jan. 26, ll:O5 A. M.---Xhe>
\A/ar Office announces that General
;\A/arren has abandoned Spion Kop.
FREDERICK L. ESOLAj has been
withdrawn by his sponsor. Mayor
James D. Phelan. as a candidate for
Chief of Police. The chief magis
trate of this city cannot keep his
discreditable ante-election compact. He
cannot make of the Police Department of
San Francisco a chattel t which must be
included among his personal belongings,
to be pawned or bartered as the exigen
cies of his political bargains may dictate.
The people of this city have been saved
from a reign of terror in which the su
premacy of the evil elements of metro
politan life would be a menace. to every
home. A decent public opinion has won
a triumph in which all good citizens have
a share and have the deepest reasons for
congratulation.
In the flght to prevent the success of
the gigantic conspiracy of political schem
ers to transform a great instrument of
good government into a machine for evil
doing, for a network of bribery, for the
indulgence and protection of crime, some
reputations have been lost, some political
suns have set in the oblivion of dishon
orable acts; but those that have been
punished raised themselves to a bad emi
nence of evil power and deserve the re
buke which they have received.
The city will not be burdened by a dis
honest police administration planned by
political tricksters as the price and re
ward for influence. The Police Commis
sioners have risen superior to the tremen
dous political pressure placed upon them.
They have proved themselves worthy of
the names which they have won in this
community. They have asserted their
manhood and have in their actions an
nounced to Mayor Phelan that bis gift of
office to them did not make them his pup
pets, to be pulled or crushed as his fancy
dictated. They have announced to him in
their deliberations that he cannot buy and
sell them as he negotiates his bonds. This
victory is instinct with meaning to the
people of San Francisco. The struggle
to secure it possessed no element of par
tisanship. It was tainted by no unworthy
motive. It was Inspired solely by the de
mand for a pure, decent public policy, to
which the people of San Francisco are en
titled.
The victory, which means so much to
the people of this . city . .was won yester
day at the imÂ»etlng of the Police Com
mission. Untn the very lÂ«t moment
Mayor Phelan. recreant to the high trust
Imposed in him, unfaithful to the.princi
ples which bring honor to public men,;
strove to force the commission to pay his
political debts. ..Indeed, his messenger in
vaded the very meeting room of the Com*
missioners to plead, cajole and threaten.
The Mayor was In consultation with the
man to whom he had sold his political
honor. He devised, in the desperation of
a lost cause, to find some way to avoid
the crash of failure so quickly following
the odium of dishonest acts and the ex
pose of a trickster's cheap scheme. But
there was no way out.- The Mayor had
pleaded again with some of the Commis
sioners to give him tho poor boon of a
fictitious success, that under it and the
charity of silence he might escape.
* He asked them supplicatlngly to appoint
Esola if only for two weeks; to make him '
a temporary Chief of Police; to do any
thing that might permit his Honor to es
cape from the scorching light of public
scorn. But the Commissioners were ob
durate. Their own reputations were at
stake. They knew the significance of the
scheme and the serious meaning of plac
ing the Police Department in the hands of
men who would use it for their own pur
poses.
Each Commissioner was prepared to re
port his findings in the investigation of
the young lieutenant, behind whom the
Mayor and his fellow-conspirators wore
working. In substance the report of Com
missioner Newhall was to the effect that
Esola Is incompetent and unfit for the
position of Chief of Police. Commissioner
Biggy was ready to report that Esoia is
not only Incompetent but for other rea
sons is an unworthy aspirant for the of
fice. Commissioner Thomas had prepared
a report exonerating Esola from the spe
cific charges > preferred . by an evening
"newspaper. This report Commissioner Mc-
Nutt was ready to sign.
The commission was thus In a deadlock
and the delay In reaching a conclusion
convinced the .liayor that all hope of
electing Esola was lost. Mayor Phelan
(Royal) Dragoons has sent a telegram to
the Emperor from Spearmans Camp as
follows: ''The Royal Dragoons send their
respectful greetings on the anniversary of
the birthday of their colonel-ln-chief." Â¦
The Emperor replied: "The colonel-in
chief sends the Royal Dragoons his best
thanks for their wishes."

LONDON. Jan. 17.â The following ac

an 'infantry officer present, was received
by to-day's mail:, Â¦- * .
"After that most terrible one-sided bat
tle of- Colenso last Friday I fainted -when
I got to camp from sunstroke, and on
Saturday morning I found that I had dys
entery. How any one escaped on Friday
Is a marvelto me. We were nine and a
half hours under fire, and It was like a
severe hailstorm on a tin roof. I could
not put my glasses up without hearing
â¢phlt-phit-phit.' From the very first I saw
It would be no go. Directly we got under
fire a corporal said to me. 'I wonder how
many Boers there are hidden in that wood
opposite along the Tugela River;*
"I said. 'I expect it is full of them, as
Buller has never shelled It at all.' I was
right. Two companies of the Twenty
third went in, and Jolly soon came out
through us and exposed our four compa
nies to a double fire, and I don't see bow
we escaped at aIL Then I saw about three
companies of the Seventh Fusileers go in
on the left of the taken guns, and they
soon came out of it. After that we were
told to advance a bit, and eventually we
were called off as escort to the lost guns,
with the result that we retired (when or
dered to^and Tommy* did not like the
word at all), and had six officers taken
and over 100 men killed, wounded miss
in* or prisoners out of a total of thirteen
officers and 372 men with which we start
ed at' 4 a. m."
"I never was in ; such a veritable fix
and hope I shall never be again, and then,
to add to it all, they peppered us with
shot, shell and those beastly - I-pound
Maxim-Nordenfeldt shells and- Mausers
until we had retired well out of range.
"But poor Tommy' was simply grand.
On the troops went through it aIL They
never hesitated one moment, never
flinched. On they went, with destruction
and death and agony all around them. I
shall never forget the sight. A man was
hit; on the line went. A shell fell be
tween two men at six paces; on they
went. A shell blew a poor captain of
the Connaught Rangers to bits. A sub
altern of the Inniskilllngs close by looked
back, but could see absolutely no trace
of his comrade left, and I see he is re
ported as missing, as they could not find
him. and yet on went the line. My own
company . was most light hearted. One
old soldier, who used to be the quarter
master's storeman at Chatham, was in
front of me while we once were ordered
to turn in file to the left and wheel to
right to double about half a mile to the
right flank of the guns, and when a bul
let whizzed very close. to him he began
to play antics and skip about, laughing
and joking the while. The bullets were
as thick as bees and I had several mighty
close to my head. Directly we halted and
lay down. Showers of bullets came. It
was truly a one-sided game, as we could
see no one to aim at at all. Just before
we lay down a private behind me said;
'Sir.. I don't know how we got through
all this without one of us getting hit. X
think God must be good to us to-day.' I
was much impressed by what this man
said.
"To show what a good fellow Tommy*
is. when near camp I felt very ill. my

The Boers massed on Mount Tabamyana
discovered on Wednesday morning that
Splon Kop had been taken by the Britlsn
attack, and endeavored to drive Warren's
men from the position which they had
won. For the whole- of Wednesday ;,*.bey
stormed it with shot and shell, but the
British troops held on. When Buller sent
his telegram Splon Kop was still in Brit
ish hands. . . â¢ i'j '^T' I;
Owing . to the night march and suuden
surprise of the Boer garrison Warren did
not suffer many casualties before dawn
broke, but Buller states that the shell fire
of the enemy was very deadly during
Wednesday and that the loss was consid
erable. â¢ .
It is hardly possible that the British
were able to. get any guns up to Splon
Kop before Wednesday night, and in con
sequence they were probably unable to
reply to the Boer artillery on the sur
rounding eminences.
There is no doubt, however, that. during
Wednesday and Thursday the British
guns were moved up under cover of dark
ness, jjj With the artillery in place upon
Splon Kop, the country can be swept for
three .or four miles around. The Boer
positions, on two ridges running to the
northwest and northeast at a level of 300
feet below, are commanded by the sum
mit.- â¢ .. 'â¢;.'Â¦. :j.
Splon Kop is nine miles in a direct line

Behind Spion Kop there are several -fine
positions for defense, which will doubtless
be taken possession of by the Boers. The
most advanced one is Schumansdal, four

where' he can make strong defensive-posi

Buller f reported , -to be dangerously

had been In conference with the Ueuten
ant's chief backer and with, him had
reached the Inevitable conclusion that the
desperate, disgraceful fight had been lost.'
The Mayor determined, therefore, to
snatch at least a little consolation from
the wreck of his plot so he sent his sec
retary. William P. Sullivan Jr.. to the
rooms of the Police Commission with a
proposal which was offered as a com
promised, but which possessed no other
significance than a plea for a poor con
cession. Mayor Phelan cared nothing then
that his movements were observed by
many.* He sought no longer to hide the
disgraceful fact that he bad attempted
to prostitute the commission- and was
striving still to Influence its action.
The - shame of that exposure was lost
In the dread of a greater one. and so
Colonel Sullivan knocked at the door of
the Commissioners' room and was ad
mitted. He came, he said, to offer a con
cession and to ask for one. He declared
that Mayor Phelan agreed to withdraw
Esola as a candidate for Chief of Police
if the Commissioners would agree to sign
a report exonerating the young lieuten
ant from the specific charges preferred
against him by an evening newspaper.
The Mayor was on his knees. He had no
power to consummate the plot which
clothes him now, in the garb of a discred
ited politician, whose greed for place
overmatched his judgment and covered
him with confusion.
* The Commissioners discussed the
Mayor's plea at length. It was finally
decided that public policy demands no
more than the removal of Esola as a pre
sumptuous aspirant for Chief of Police
and not necessarily his dismissal from the
Police Department. So the Mayor's plead
ing found a listening ear. and by a unani
mous vote the following resolution was
adopted:
In re charges preferred by Fremont Older
against F. U Esola.
WÂ« find Frederick L. Esota not sullty on any

The concluding paragraph of the fore
going resolution settles F. L. Esola as â¢
candidate for Chief of Police of this city.
He has been withdrawn and the episode,
as far as he Is concerned, is over. Colonel
Sullivan left the rooms of the Commis
sioners with relief. The Commissioners
then discussed the claims of other candi
dates. The name of Police Captain G.
W. Wlttman was suggested, but friends of
his had already announced that he Is not
an aspirant for the position. He had
said that as a police captain he has a
lucrative position during good behavior
and he does not care to accept the larger
salary but shorter term of Chief of Police
with its haxard of political changes and
dubious consequences. Under these cir
cumstances his name was withdrawn
from the list of eligibles. Robert Hogran
and Charles Holbrook were also consid
ered, but the Commissioners did not deem
them available for the serious duties of
the -position. *
The Commissioners had canvassed all of
the candidates . and had accepted none.
The ground has been cleared, a serious
difficulty has been passed and the odor
of an unwelcome political nest has been
removed from the deliberations of the
commission. These gentlemen have In
sisted upon exercising their own personal
Judgment unhampered by anybody's
pledge or promise. They have nothing to
disturb their purpose to obey an honor
able public policy and to place in com
mand of the Police Department of this
city a man who shall be above reproach
and shall possess the experience and the
ability which shall qualify him to perform
the serious and grave duties of his office.
As The Call has said before it has no
candidate and will suggest none. The
Commissioners are men of affairs and of
varied "experience. They know the seri
ous obligation which has been placed upon
them in their relation to the people of
San Francisco and they are asked simply
to take a man of their own choosing to
administer honorably and efficiently the
tremendous machinery of the department
of police.*
LONDON. Jan. 28.â At 2 o'clock this
morning we know as j much as we
did at 10 o'clock yesterday morning
ânothing more. General Butler's
dispatch announcing the taking of
Splon Kop is the only Intelligence
which has reached London, and that Is so
brief that we have little detail of -what '
has happened. If Splon Kop 'ls situated
as indicated, at a point where two ridges
unite, running northeast to Dewdrop and
northwest to Acton Homes, its occupation
by the British troops must ha%*e cut the
advance of the Boer position in two.
According to General Buller's dispatch
General Warren thinks the position along
the Tugela has been rendered untenable
by the capture of Splon Kop, assuming, of
course, that the British are able to hold
it. The Boers were holding a very long
line. It was something like thirty miles
long, their extreme right being at Spicn
Kop arid Mount' Tabamyana. the center
opposite. Potgieters Drift and the left at
Colenso. It was impossible for them to
be equally strong in force throughout this

SYDNEY, N. S. W., Jan.
25. â A wharf laborer here has
been stricken with the bubonic
plague, and the attending doc
tors are of the opinion that he
was inoculated with thÂ« dis
ease through the bite of a flea.
'TICTORIA. Jan. 25.â The harvest of
% / death Is -increasing dally at Hono
1/ lulu. - According to advices re-
IE oelved by the steamer Miowera,
which arrived this morning, when
*he left, on January 17, the death roll
had reached thirty-nine. She brought no
passengers from the Infected port, but her
purser says a thousand or more were of
fering, for ' there was a panic in the
plague-stricken city. The panic was due
to the fact that the last victim of the
plague had been a white woman and one
whose mode of life was such that none
would ever have dreamed that she would
have fallen a victim. " The lady, Mrs.
George E. Boardman. lived in the best of
style in a good part of the town. She
had a large house and kept several ser
vants. She was of excellent family and
prominent in church work of the city.
Her husband, who is an agent for the im
portation of Japanese laborers, has 'a
elight touch of Hawaiian blood. She was
certainly thought by all to be immune.
After an Illness of two weeks she de
veloped plague symptoms and on the 14th,
two days later, was dead.
Many are the stories told of how she be
came Infected. She was manager of
the art department. of a large store and, a
dead rat was found in her department.
ene 3L-jj*-rintetÂ»<jÂ«l the removal of therat
and it la thought she then contracted the
disease. Others say that one of her
servants waÂ» in the cordoned districts and
she secured his release from quarantine
and contracted the scourge from him.
When It was known that she had fallen
a victim the panic was intense and there
was talk of a general quarantine with the
suspension of all business. No such action
was, however, taken.
A sanitary committee has been organ
ised by the citizens, the town has been
<Jl\-lded and a volunteer Inspector ap
pointed to each district. Each person in
the district is seen twice a day by the in
spector. Thus it is hoped that each new
case will be discovered in its lnciplency
and thus the plague will be checked. The
citizens of Hllo have taken a firm stand
to prevent the landing of steamers there
from the Infected ports. Sheriff Andrews,
agent of the Board of Health, has issued
orders forbidding communication with
Honolulu, and the citizens armed with
guns and other weapons see that no
steamer lands from that port. Several
steamers which had permits from the
Board of Health were refused a* landing,
and even supplies and water. When the
Xlr.au was sent back without being allowed
to land the Board of Health sent Attorney
General Cooper as its agent, at the same
time revoking the commission of . An
drews. When Cooper reached Hilo he
was refused a landing, a mob armed with
guns, etc, gathering on the wharf to pre
vent him. On Andrews going on the
Klnau to consult with Cooper the mob
also refuted to allow him to return ashore,
and he only got back with the help of the
officers of the survey ship Pathfinder,
who assisted him to make a landing by
force. When the Miowera left the ques
tion of food supply in many parts of the
Island was becoming serious, and the peo
ple of Honolulu greatly condemned the
action of Hllo, which they charged was
acting as It did to make itself the source
of supply.
The fire department is still busy dally
burning down Infected buildings. No less
than ten blocks have been burned. When
the steamer was at Honolulu the steamer
Torlhime Maru arrived from Japan with
about 600 Immigrants, and two days be
fore the steamer Doyo Maru arrived with
TOO. There are now nearly 4000 In quaran
tine.
Dr. A. Cannichael of the United States
Marine Hospital has been appointed chief
quarantine officer at Manila, and he will
leave for his post by the next available
steamer.
Purser Young of the Miowera. says he
was told at Honolulu that a number of
passengers are coming to the coast from
there in sailing vessels.
There was considerable excitement at
Sydney when the Miowera left." The
plague had broken out at Adelaide, and In
JCew Caledonia there had- been sixteen
deaths. The cases were averaging three
per day. Â¦. ; : â¢ Â¦ . ;, ; .

VERY HEATED COLLOQUY
OCCURS IN THE *SENATE
Money of Mississippi and Chandler
of New Hampshire Argue the
Southern Question.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â Just at the
close of to-day's session of the Senate a
speech delivered by Money of Mississippi
on the race question in the South pre
cipitated a heated colloquy between him
and Chandler (Rep.) of New Hampshire,
in which the latter alleged that the South
ern Senators by Intemperate statements
were reopening the whole Southern ques
tion after it was supposed to be dead.
The charge which Chandler Â£ par
ticularly criticized was made by Morgan
of Alabama, who is absent at present, but
as it had been reiterated substantially,
in Mr. Chandler's opinion, by other , Sena.-'
tors, he declared he did not purpose to
permit it to go unrefuted. The charge was
that the civil war had been precipitated
by designing politicians of the North for
the purpose of putting the slaves on a
political and social equality with the
Southern whites. Chandler's .refutation
of the statement was made with char
acteristic vehemence and aggresiveness,
but as no reply was offered the incident
ended there. : Â¦
Th urgent deficiency bill, carrying about
$9,000,000, was passed without division and
practically without debate. Â¦ â¢

SAN JOSE, Jan. 25.â City Superintendent
of Schools Russell has received an opin
ion from Attorney General Ford which
throws open the primary and grammar
grades of the city to all pupils living out
side the city limits, and will undoubtedly
abolish the tuition fees the city has been
charging for outside pupils. The Attorney
General states that the education and the
management and control of public schools
is a matter of State care and supervision,
and that a city for primary and grammar
school purposes standÃ upon the same
basis as a school district, and school trus
tees cannot lawfully charge tuition for
the attendance of pupils from other dis-
r Thfs decision, it is expected, will greatly
increase the attendance of the schools of
San Jose. There are some 5000 people liv
ing just beyond the city limits of this city,
and the tuition charge has kept most of
these pupils from attending the local
school. Now that this barrier is removed
they will all attend the city schools, where
the advantages are better, and the local
schools will be crowded.
SUFFERING WOMAN
TAKES MORPHINE
Suicide of Mrs. Wyman
in Washington.
?
Prfcial Dispatch to ThÂ» Call
KETTLE FALLS. Wash., Jan. 25.â
While temporarily deranged from a longr
illness Mrs. Katherine Wyman ended her
life this morning with morphine. She was
the wife of Dr. Hall M. Wyman. a
prominent physician of this place. Her
mother, Mrs. A. Clark, and other rela
tives reside in San Francisco. Mrs. Wy
man had been sick for some time and
suffered great agony. Her friends sug
gest tliat she did not contemplate suicide
and that an overdose of the drug was
taken by her through mistake. She left
a letter addressed to her husband, thÂ«
contents of which he refuses to make
public.
The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict
finding that death resulted from an un
known drug administered by unknown
hands.
Every effort was made to save her life
after It had been discovered she had taken
the drug, but in vain. She lingered about
two hours before death ended her suffer
ings. Mrs. Wyman was a writer of more
than ordinary ability and was at one time
a valuable contributor to coast and East
ern newspapers and periodicals.
! view of assuaging public anxiety, and the
ominous rumors respecting the fate of
the ex-Emperor are spreading widely. It
is alleged that his dethronement was de
cided upon at a council convened by the
Empress Dowager en Tuesday. The Man
chu clan favors the change, but the Che
proper oppose it and predict. a tremen
dous upheaval.
It is believed that the Russian and
French legations were notified of the im
pending change, and that they will sup
port the new regime. It is also reported
that a French naval force has already
reached Peking.
The P,ritish and United States legations,
who have been favorable to Kwang Su,
were kept in ignorance of the new depar
ture, but it is asserted that Li Hung
Chang was sent as viceroy to Kwang
tung to support the Dowager's policy and
to repress any hostilities pn the part of
Cantonese. ...
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times says: "The edict is obviously a
half-measure intended to test the effect
on public opinion of the restoration of
the regency and the selection of a new
Emperor, whose claims, according to the
established succession laws, are open to
question."

EMPEROR WAS MURDERED

posed of Woodgatc-'s and Coke's brigades. General Warren has had large
exj-erience in South African warfare and his friends are confident that he will
win larger laurels during the present campaign. He served in the Kaffir war
of lÂ£Ti as lieutenant colonel of the Diamond Fields Horse and as commander
of part of the West Griqualand Field Force in IST*, winning mention in the
Governor's dispatches as having shown "energy, ability and resource under

Arabia in I^2 for the purpose of bringing to justice the murderers of Professor
Palmer and his party. For this service he received the K. C. M. G. In
ISS4-S5 he was in command of the Bechuanaland expedition, in which he dis
played great tact and ability, forestalling the Boers in their attempt to oc
cupy the country, without collision or bloodshed. He won their highest re
ppect and was known and spoken of among them as "the general." Follow
ing this he was made G. C. M. G. General Warren's services as Chief of the
Metropolitan Police Force of London won him much honor. The reforms
and system introduced by him have added largely to the morals and efficiency

WASHINGTON: Jan. 25.â The. case of
Brigham H. Roberts, the Mormon. liepre
sentative-elect lrom Utah, which has oc
cupied so much of the attention of the
House since the assembling of Congress,
was decided to-day by the adoption of a
resolution to exclude him by a vote of 26S
to SO.
The exact language of the resolution
was as follows:
That, under ths facts and circum
stances of the casa, Brigham H. Rob
erts, Representative-elect from the
State of Utah, ought not to have or
hold a ssat in the House of Repre
sentatives, and that the seat ,to
which he was elected is hereby de
clared vacant.
The amendment to expel Roberts with
out sciitins; him; offered by Lacy, was
ruled out uh Â¦Â» point of order, aivl the
House only voted on the resolutions of tht;
majority jn<l minority ol the committee.
Tht- litter, to .sent and then expel Rob
erts-, was defeated. Â«1 to 244. An analysis
of this vote shows that 170 Repubiicans,
72 Democrats .ird I' Populists voted against
it. and 71 Democrats. 6 Republicans. 2 Pop
ulists and :' Silver Republicans for it. Tne
majority resolutions, to exclude Roberts
and declare the rteat vacant, were adopt

vided as follows. Republicans 168, Demo

list 1. There were over a score of speak
ers to-day, and the closing speeches on
each* Bide i. were particularly able. Lunham
of Texas closed for the majority aril De
Armond of Missouri for the minority.
Roberts was present throughout the day
ami loft the' hall after the result of the
last vote had been announced. As he did
so ho gave out a statement justifying his
retention of his plural wives on the ground
thai his moral obligation was more bind
ing upon his conscience than technical
obedience to statutory law. and saying
that there was little excuse for the ex
traordinary efforts to crush a system al
ready abandoned and practically dead. Ho
said " he was a martyr to a "spasm of
prejudice." He would not. he said, at
tempt to run for Congress again, although
he would go back home with a light heart,
confident of the future.
Sims of Tennessee was the first speak
er to-day. He made a legal argument in
favor of seating and then expelling Rob
erts.
Johnson of West Virginia advocated the
expulsion of Roberts.
Brosius of Pennsylvania argued that
metaphysical and technical considerations
should not deter Congress from doing Its
duty. In this crisis of the nation's good
name and fame such considerations
should be swept aside and the will of the
people executed.
Grout of Vermont supported the conten
tion of the majority for exclusion.
Talbert of South Carolina said that in a
case of such abnormal and defiant im
morality technicalities should not weigh.
Representing the constituency he did. he
should vote against Roberts first, last and
all tho*time.
Adamson of Georgia said violation of
th? statute against unlawful cohabitation
entitled the offender to membership in the
penitentiary rather than the House of
Representatives. '
Roberts came Into the hall- while Ad
amson was speaking and listened to the
debate from a lounge in the lobby behind
the rail. â¢ Â¦' .
. Ray of New York was in favor of the
exclusion of Roberts as a polygamist and
an offender against decency.
Freer of West Virginia also advocated
exclusion. . â¢ " â¢
Brick of Indiana favored expulsion. He
did ? not want to make a martyr of Rob
erts, ' which Â¦ would win for him pity or
sympathy. - .Â¦â¢.Â¦." Â¦ Â¦ '
Moody of Massachusetts argued that the
House had the right to exclude or expel,
but that it was expedient that Roberts
should be excluded.
Grosvenor of Ohio supported the views
of the majority in favor of exclusion. He
paid a high tribute to Littlefleld's speech.
H* said he had never heard an abler ar
gument on false ground. -
Morris of Minnesota, a member of the
special committee which investigated the
Roberts case, and who signed the major
ity report, advocated' its adoption in an
hour's speech.
De Armond of Missouri, in supporting
tho minority report, said that the argu
ment of the majority that the method of
turDing Roberts out mattered not was
the. argument of Judge Lynch; The real
quefetlon was, "Shall the constitution be
observed?" Roberts was' entitled- to be
sworn in.
De Armond devoted much of his time to
a legal argument against the proposition
that the House could add to the constitu
tional qualifications of members. Ho
reorc-d those who had unnecessarily
abus-ed Roberts. Roberts, he said, had
not a solitary champion or defender on
the floor. and he would < scorn
as beneath him and beneath con
tempt an effort to evoke, applause by
denunciation. "I oppose polygamy; I
scorn It," said he, "but I do not, feel it
necessary, in order to show how good I
am, how I love motherhood and chastity,
to lend myself to cheap abuse, which re
quires neither ability nor courage."
This utterance drew forth a round of
applause. Roberts, who sat within
twenty feet of De Armond, his head rest
ing on his hand, did not move a muscle.
hitnharn of Texas eloped the debate In
behalf of the majority resolutions. He
said that if there ever had been a neces
sity for a. rational assertion and vindica
tion of the supreme prerogative of the
House this occasion was now upon us. He
loved the constitution of his country and
the institutions of his Government, but
neither the constitution requires nor do
the people expect the House to do any
thing ridiculous. .-..Â«â¢ .
"We can never convince the American
people," said. he. "that to admit Roberta
and Instantly expel him 13 a logical and
consistent procedure. The .motive that
will prompt the vote either to. 1 expel or
exclude will be precisely the sameâ and
that is because he is a polygamist; if a
disqualification not mentioned in the con
stitution is imposed in the one case, it
will be equally superadded in the other."
He maintained that the House possessed
the Inherent power, aside from its express
and implied constitutional ! warrant, to
protect and uphold itself in its dignity,
integrity and reputation. He cited In
stances which would warrant the House
In standing aside a person bearing a cer
tificate of election.
"Suppose," he said, "there 'had been an
election for Territorial Delegate held in
our alleged antipodal possessions, the
Philippine Islands, and, coming with a
certificate of ejection issued by the Presi
dent or Consul, whoever might be au
thorized to sfgn the commission, the Sul
tan of Jolo. fresh from his seraglio,
should appear and demand to have the
oath administered to him as a Delegate
to this Congress? If the facts which have
been alleged against him were ascertained
to be true, should he not be excluded?
Under the theory of the minority of the
committee we might say, 'Will your
Royal Highness be sworn?' and then kick
him out instantly. Under the theory of
the majority we would say to him at the
threshhold, 'Avaunt!' "
When Lanham concluded. Lacy (R.) of
lowa offered an amendment to the ma
jority resolution providing for the expul
sion of Roberts. To this Tayler made the
point of order that the amendment was
not germane. -The- Speaker sustained the
point of order on the -ground that the or
iginal .proposition, only, required, a,major
ity- vote, while ii the -amendment were
added it would require a two-thirds voteV

? ? ? > ??????.?? + ?;? +
? LONDON, Jan. 25.â Accord- ?
-f ing to a special dispatch from +
+ Shanghai, it is reported that +
+ Emperor Kwang Su has com- +
+ mitted suicide. +
? + ???? + ?4- + + + + + + +
PEKING, Jan. 25.â The imperial edict
issued yesterday says that owing to the
Emperor's poor health he Is unable to
conduct the business of state, and ap
points Pu Chun, son of Prince Tuano, his
heir.
The Emperor apparently has been com
pelled by the Dowager Empress to abdi
cate about the Chinese New Year, though
it. is understood this will meet with con
siderable opposition in certain court cir
cles. The Dowager Empress, however, in
tends to carry out the programme which
she has been planning for years.
LONDON, Jan. 25.â The Chinese Minis
ter here was evidently expecting news of
some important event at Peking. When
the story of the Emperor's abdication was
communicated to him by a representative
of the Associated Press he said: "i have
no official news on the subject. I kn ,-w
something was going on in Peking, but;
nothing as yet has been officially commu
nicated to me. 1 am greatly ooliged for
ycur information." '
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â Secretary Hay
was advised to-day by United States Min
ister Conger at Peking of the result of me
convocation of Chinese notables ther-> yrt
tcrday, his statement being that Pu Chun,
14 years of age, had been appointed heir
apparent. There is a notable discrepancy
between Mr. Conger's statement and that
cabled from Shanghai, and it is impossible
to learn here which is accurate at this
time, neither the State Department nor
the Chinese legation having further in
formation on the subject than that con
tained in Mr. Congers brief dispatch. It
will be noticed that he does not indicate
that the heir has been chosen as Emperor
nor that he Is to ascend the throne imme
diately. The- Jesuit Is awaited with great
interest here, for by the character of the
selection made of t,he successor to the
present Emperor may be determined the
question whether the Russian or the Japa
nese influence is predominant in China.
The Chinese Minister, Mr. Wu Ting
Fang, when shown the above dispatch,
was at first inclined to doubt and dis
credit it, but on examining the circum
stantial detail of the reported edict he
said :
"1 am unable to say whether It is true
or not. Thus far I have received nothing,
official or unofficial, to indicate that such
a change has been made or was contem
plated. A short time ago a report was
current that the son of the Prince of
Tuan (erroneously given .in the dispatch
as Prince Tuario) would be named as heir
apparent. But I have not been informed
that this would bfe done. It would not be
surprising if an heir-apparent were desig
nated," as this occurs at times,' usually in
order to provide a succession ' when an
h.mperor is \ sick or otherwise incapaci
tated."
After consulting reference? on the gene
alogry-of th.e -imperial Â¦familyy.Mr. Wu sald
that as near as he could, tell Prince Tii.in
isa son of 'thft* former Emperor, Hlen
Fung, thus making the reported new tm
peror, Â¦ Pu Chun, a grandson of Emperor
Hien Fung. The latter, was followed by
Ting Chi, a son of the present Empress
Dowager, who still retains her strong Jn
fluence over court affairs. Her son was
without issue -and was -succeeded by the
present -Emperor, Kwang Su, nephew of
the Empress- Dowager,;, and 5 designated
through her influence. â¢ In case the re
ported change has been made it ; will be
a continuance of the same imperial fam
ily at. the head of affairs, with the Em
press Dowager remaining as theÂ¦ Â¦ strong
power behind the i throne. Prince Tuan
has been little known in public affairs,
which, however, is not surprising, as
members of the imperial household do -not
mingle With the outside world and are
practically unknown. ."'â¢'
When asked if such, a change would en
tail any change of Chinese policy. Minis
ter "Wu said: ' ? " <â¢
"Not the slightest. It does -not" Indicate
any change of 'policy on international or
foreign affairs; nor on our domestic,af
fairs. Our people are a quiet,' peaceful
people and have little regard for personal
changes which may occur in the govern
ment." , â¢Â£Â¦ â¢

WAR IN PHILIPPINES
PRACTICALLY ENDED
Last Concentrated Force Scattered, but There
Is Danger of Bloody Feuds Between
Soldiers and Natives.
Specia! Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted. 1300. by James Gordon
liennett.
MANILA. Jan. 25.â The war in the Phil
ippines is over. No further surrender can
!>e hoped for. The danger in the present
situation is that a bloody feud may arise
between the American army and the Fill
pines. This danger can be greatly les
sened by the action of Congress, which is
cow imperative, in outlining a policy of
government in the Philippines.
It is likely that many insurgents are still
holding out for the very best terms which
Cbacren will be willing to give.
The time Is ripe far a conciliatory policy,
ftUowlnc the Filipinos to have some say

Â¦which they will be obliged to live.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.-Ocneral Otis*
cabled report received this morning Indi
cates that General Schwan is conducting
the campaign In the south of Luzon with
the greatest energy. He has located
Boutheart cf Laguna de Bay what is prob
ably the last considerable force of insur
gents remaining in one command, and to
day's report shows that v.ith small loss
to himself and heavy loss to the enemy
h.A has managed to completely dissipate
this force, probably beyond the possibility
of reconstruction. General Otis' cable
gram is as follows:
MANILA. Jan. 2S.â Schwan concentrated the
thirtieth battalion of the Thirty-seventh and
Thirty-ninth Infantry at and near San I ahlo,
Laguna province, on the Â«rternoon of the ZOUi
Hayes with cavalry striking for Tayabas by the
lower road. The enemy had advanced from
Santa Cruz to very Ftronply fortified positions
at Pan Diego. Majayjay and adjacent points > n
the country very broken and mountainous.
Schwan nrurk the enemy at San Di'BO. and in
an Migas<-mÂ»nt lasting two hours killed Â«2 and
wounded a large number. Our casualties were
one onllste.l man killed and fourteen wounded.
includtr.K three native scouts. Captured sev
eral rifles, ammunition, bolos and stock of uni
form clothinc On the 22d Schwan pushed
through on to Lollo. driving the enemy back
to Majayjay. where a force reported by an es
caped Spanish prisoner to number between 1500
and 3'X<o well equipped and supplied, had con
centrated, awaiting the approach of troops.
This position was Impregnable via roads or
trails and the. troops were working around on
the flank of the enemy when the enemy retreat
ed rapidly, with the Thirtieth Infantry and
cavalry in 'pursuit. It is -believed that the in
surirents are widely dispersed. The country is
now covered by troops, and our force occupied
i-anta Cms. a few minor enKaKements at other
points reFulfirc in considerable loss to the en
emy. Mac Arthur telegraphs that McÃae struck

NEW COMBINE OF
SALMON CANNERS
Contract Entered Into by British
Columbia Capitalists to Regu
late Prices for the Year.
Sptclal Disratch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 25. -The
Fixty-eight salmon canneries of British
Columbia entered a combine to-day by
the proprietors signing a contract lasting
for a year. Some sort of trust has been
talked of for a long time, and several
offers were received from the American
side to bring in outside capital to carry
on weak parts of the business. These
offers were rejected, but the canners held
many meetings since, when it was real
ized that if some arrangement were not
made they would not be able to compete
with "Puget Sound and the Columbia
River, where there Is a close combine.
Prominent canners even went so far as
to say that the industry would be dead
In the province in three years if local
throat-cutting Â¦went on.
The agreement involves two questions â
the price of salmon and the size of the
pack. It Is admitted that American can
ners would attempt and could undersell
the Canadians next year if the old condi
tions existed. Now prices for fish will be
arranged at the opening of the season
and the association will decide how much
each cannery shall put up in order that
there may be no drug of canned stuff on
the market.

WILLIAM J. BRYAN
THEIR CHOICE
Democrats of Pennsyl-
vania Take Action.
HARRISBURG. Pa.. Jan. 23.â The State
Democratic Committee set the pace for
the Democracy of other States to-day by
making William J. Bryan its choice for
the Presidency in 1900. This action was
taken by the committee while Bryan was
on his way to Harrisburg from New York
to attend the meeting and confer with the
party leaders. This is probably the first
time in the party's history that the Demo
crats of Pennsylvania have Indicated
their choice for President In advance of
the State convention.
There was a large attendance of Demo
crats from all over the State to meet
Bryan and hear him discuss the Issues on
which the coming campaign will be waged.
The State convention will be held In this
city on April 5 and will adopt a platform
along the lines laid down by the Nebraska
orator in his speech to-night before dO<JO
people at the Keller-street Hall. The plat
form will lndors-e the Chicago declaration
of principles, denounce the trusts and Im
perialism, advocate ballot reform and
pure elections and condemn machine poll
tics. The convention will also nominate
candidates for Auditor General, Congress
men at large and Presidential electors
and elect eight delegates at large to the
national convention.
Bryan reached here at 3 o'clock and was
escorted to the Board of Trade rooms,
where the State Committee was in ses
sion, by a committee representing the
local and Democratic committees. He was
introduced to the assemblage by State
Chairman Rilling and made a short
speech, which was received with much
e/Uhuslasm. He said:
When I come to talk to Eastern Democrats
I feel It Is my duty to give them every as
sistance I can and to tell that we appreciate
the odds they have to contend atjainst. It Is
easy to be a Democrat in the South, and It is
easier to be a Democrat in the West than It
used to be. I believe the time will come
when the Chicago platform Democracy
will be as popular in Pennsylvania as It is out
in Nebraska. While no Republican can re
member what was In the Republican platform
of 130 C. and while no Gold Democrat can re
peat the Indianapolis platform, every Demo
crat and every Republican can remember the
Chicago platform. The Democrats ouÂ»?ht to
make progress in this State t-ecause the Ue
jpublican party Is more corrupt In this State
than In any other State in the I'nlon. Unless
the people have forgotten to think and act for
themselves they oupht to rise up and wipe the
Republican party out of existence. If the vot
ers of the Democratic party speak now as they
did In '28 they will send men to the National
Convention who will write a platform like thac
of the Chicago declaration of principles. I
believe we are going to win in the campaign
of 1900. The young men who are coming to
vote this year for the first time are beglnninK
to believe that the Republican party is a good
thing for the monqpoly and a poor thins for
the young man. who. as things are going, now,
can only hope to be a poor clerk for some
monor-oly.
At the close of the meeting Bryan held
an informal reception at the Common
wealth Hotel, and later he was the guest
of Mayor Fritchey at a dinner party, at
which "Colonel Guffey. Chairman Rilling
and other party leaders were present.
After to-night's meeting he attended a
session of the local lodge of Modern
Woodmen, of which he is an active mem
ber at his home In Lincoln, Nebr. Colonel
Bryan will go from here to Smyrna and
Wilmington, Del., and from there to
Washington to meet the national leaders.

GUARD STABBED
BY A CONVICT
Ed Haggerty Seriously
Injured at Folsom.
â¢
SDeclal Dinnatch to The Call
SAN QTTENTTX PRISON". Jan. 2.l.â The
annals of Fohsom prison have apain been
stained crimson by the efforts of Us des
perate Inmates to equal the record of
crime made by their colleagues In strip**
cf San Quentln.
Word was received here to-day from
Folsom of a convict's attempt to take tha
life of a guard by the knife, which envala
In brutality the assault made by Convict
Oppenhelmer on Guard McDonald* o' Sara
Quentin last April.
The convicts had assembled at nocn in
side the yard of Folsom preparatory to
beinc marched into the dining-room when
Frank Mitchell, a twelve-year man, en
gaged In a scuffle with another convict.
Guard Ed Hasgerty stepped between tbm
men. Quick as a flash Mitcnell whipped
out a knife and made a vicious lungf? at
Haggerty's heart. Haggerty stepped to
one side and received the full force of tha
thrust in his nÂ»ck, the knife sinking to th*
hilt. Haggerty sank to the ground, and
Mitchell, casting aside the dagger, slunlc
through the crowd of excited convicts,
hoping to conceal his Identity amidst tha
throng. Had he been dressed as they
were Ilapgerty's assassin would never
have been discovered, but a trusty who
had seen the whole affair noticed that
Mitchell wore a red shirtâ the bad-je of
the desperate criminal. Hajrtrerty's as
sailant alone of the crowd in the yarr' at
, the time wore a garment of that color,
and with this clew Mitchell was easily
singled out and captured.
Haggerty was to-day resting CTÂ«'ly.
though his condition is critical. Tho knifa
was made from a file and is nearly twelve
Inches in length. It missed by a fraction
of an inch severing the jugular vein, and
to this fact Ilaggerty owes what hope, of
life remains.
Frank Mitchell, the would-be as-aspiu.
I has the reputation of being one <<t the
j most desperate convicts in Folsom. Ha
I was sent up frrm Sonoma County three
I years ago to serve a twelve-year sentence
I for burglary. Ever since his incarceration
! he has been distinguished for his violent.
j implacable temper, and the v stabbing of
Hagfre'ty was the fulfillment of n number
of threats made by him. Mitchell was at
once cast into solitary confinement pend
ing the result of his brutal crime. If Hag
gerty dies he will stand trial for murder;
if the guard recovers his assailant vlll
'in all probability be confined in fie
! famous "incorrigible cell" here. It i:> sv,p-
I posed that the attempt on Haggerty s lire
was directly Influenced by a desire on
Mitchell's part to rival the record mada
by Convict Oppenheimer.

PARTIAL VICTORY
FOR NAVAL BILL
Passed by the Federal
Council.
â¢
Fr***':!! rahlÂ«>r ah1Â«> to The Call and New Tork Her
ald. Â¦ Copyrighted, IWX), by James Oordoa
Bennett.
BERLIN, Jan. 25.â The Federal Council
to-day passed the new naval bill. Several
m<-mbors of tho Richter section of the
Radical party deny the statement of the
Vorwfcerts that they have already con
s.nted to vote for the bill.
The Berliner Tageblatt, in an article on
the na\-al bill, says it may be admitted
that the unanimously expressed determin
ation of various legislative factors in the
state to double is of great. import for the
prestigÂ« of Germany abroad and for the
political and econnmical development of
the country. On the other hand,. it must
make aji unpleasant Impression that the
federal governments which have closely
examined the new naval programme,
which it will take years to carry out.
have great hesitation about fixing the
lime of Its completion. Seventeen of the
federal governments have not insisted
upon this, being convinced that the
Reichstag will do everything possible to
carry out the programme as fast as the
linancial resources of the empire will per
mit. The financial side of the pro
gramme will require to be mostly exam
ined by Parliajnent, as any additions to
the burden of the masses by indirect tax
ation. as the Conservatives propose, wouh
make it impossible for every real friem
of the people to defend the naval bill.

Keith Wakeman, who Will Appear at the California.
rMOTin DANIEL FRAWLEY has found a new leading lady to take Mar
Hampton's roles. She is Keith \V*keman, an Oakland girl, who has wo
histrionic success both in this country and in Ensland. and Fran-lev i
bringing her all the way from London to rill the gap in his company.
Mips Wakfmnn is a woman of striking beauty, both as to face and form. She
left London on January 17 and reached New York yesterday. Tuesday next Is
the day iixed for her arrival in this city. Originally Miss Wakcman was sched
uled to leave I^onilon on the Ist of this month, hut t=he could not sever her con
nection at that time with the E. S. Willard company, of which she was a mem
ber. The next Steamer left on the 13th, but superstitious fear forced her to post
pone the journey till four days later.
Miss Wakeman will come to this city with the manuscript of some new plays,
and. incidentally, a new wardrobe of ihe latest fashion from Paris.
Mary Hampton appeared with Frawley for the last time Wednesday evening.
Miss Wakcman will remain with Frawley just for this season, returning to E. S.
Wlllard during the summer.
FRAWLEY'S NEW LEADING LADY
IS ON THE WAY FROM LONDON
MUST GIVE PARTY
RATES TO ALL
Railroads Not Allowed
to Discriminate.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â Mr. Trac<rwell #
the Comptroller of the Treasury, has ren
dered a decision to the eftect that common
carriers which do an interstate Tuisin.-H
and give "party rates" to theatrical' and
other organizations must give the,; samo
rates to the general public under
conditions and also to tho Government ia
the transportation of troops. In _ his de
cision the Comptroller says:
The railway companies attempt to limit tha
use of party rate tickets to theatrical compa
nies and a few other association^ and decline
to issue them to parties ot etjua.l -nunnN-r oC
persons traveling under substantially the sain*
circumatances and conditions. In my opinior*
this constitutes an unjust d[s<-rirrtlnatiÂ« - >n which,
the law prohibits and declares to be illegal.
There appears to be no mere reason for tnia
discrimination than there would be to issue
the tickets to a party whose names wero Smith
and refuse them to an equal number ot Urowns,
or to Issue them when the purpose of the Jour-Â«
ney was pleasure and refuse them when ths
purpose was business.
A second question Involved Is whether thesÂ«
party rates ar<! subject to reduction when t^.Â»
service Is rendered to the Government by tha
free or the 50 per cent land grant railroads.
The ground upon which I hold that the Gov
ernment is entitled to the benefit of party rate*
Is that said rates are available for tho general
public, and. therefore, for the Government.
â¢ â¢ â¢ As party rates are charged the general
public in cases like those now under considera
tion no. more than 5n per cent of said rates car*
be paid for that part of tho service rendered by
said roads to the Government.
There are other roads which have airreed tq
accept the same net cash rates as apply to tha
land grant roads, therefore proper reductlmij
must be made for that part of the service ren-*
dered by these roads.

Victory for Thorsens.
STOCKTON, Jan. 25.â Judge Jones de
cided this afternoon from the bench that
the sole heirs to the estate of Peter Chris
tensen, the miser hermit, who died In this
county over a year ago, are four first cous
ins of the deceased, residing in Denmark,
on the isle of Alsen. Each will receive an
equal share of what remains of the estate
after the legatees of tho will are settled
with, about $75,(X>0. Christensen was an il
legitimate child and had no brother or
sister, though there were claimants to the
estate, who claimed relationship in that
direction. The Judge in his decision de
clared that it was positively in evidence
that Christensen had no brother or sister
and that he was a native of Denmark, and
not Norway, as the other claimants de
clared. The decision is a victory for the
Thorsen claimants.

BAKERSFIELD
FIELD TRIALS
HAVE CLOSED
Sams Bow Wins the Cham
pion Stake From Peach
Mark.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 25.â The seventh
annual field trials of the Pacific Coast
Field Trial Club were brought to a suc
cessful conclusion to-night, one day ear
lier than was anticipated owing to the
fact that thÂ» Members' stake was de
clared off for lack of, entries. Some of
the most Bcnsational work ever seen at
tho trials took place during to-day's all
age and champion stakes. In the former
a surprise was sprung by Cuba of Ken
wood, and Nellie Wilson coming in for
second and third place. The work of each
yesterday was, to say the least, mediocre,
but their performances to-day were so
brilliant that they were placed as above
stated.
The heat yesterday evening between
Gladstar and Peach Mark, which turned
out in an unsatisfactory way owing to
Gladstar's disappearance, was, at the sug
gestion of Judge Johnson, declared off
and the dogs placed down this morning
as though the heat had not been run. A
late start was made on the grounds, and
the first brace of dogs, Gladstar and
King of Blithe, were cast off at 8:40 in
an open field into which a large number
of birds had been flushed. There was
plenty of opportunity for range and speed
work, and out a few yards had been cov
ered by the dogs when each pointed al
most at the same instant. Star soon
pointed another single near a ditch, which
King did not honor, but went in and took
the point in front of Star. The dogs were
down less than fifteen minutes, when they
were ordered up, and Peach Mark and
Cuba of Kenwood called for. In this heat,
as in most of the succeeding ones, bril
liant work was done. Each dog pointed
and backed in faultless style, and both
were steady to wing and shot. The heat
lasted exactly fifteen minutes. It ap
peared to the spectators that the work
of the two dogs was abouf equal.
The next brace cast off were Verona
Cash and Nellie Wilson. This, like the
preceding heats, was of short duration.
Nellie gained three points to nothing lor
Verona. It was believed by many that
Cuba's excellent work in the first heat
would bring^him into the finals, and this
was confirmed by the Judge next calling
for Cuba, and Gladstar, who went down at
i): 40. They were cast off in an open field
adjoining that in which the first work v/sa
done. In a feVt- moments Cuba had
dropped to a point, which Star failed to
honor, and instead of backing circled
around Cuba, evidently endeavoring to lo
cate the bird. His handler finally dropped
him, but in doing so flushed the bird, but
Cuba remained steady. The pair was 01
dered up at once, having been down les><s
than five minutes.
Peach Mark and Nellie Wilson were
next called for, and this again was a beau
tiful heat, it being difficult to say which
dog bad the better of the excellent range
and point work displayed. The heat last
ed twenty-five minutes, after which the
dogs were ordered up, and the judge an
nounced that the next brace would te
Cuba and Peach Mark, and declared a re
cess of half an hour to give Peach a
breathing spell. It was evident by this
time what dogs would be in the money,
but there was a grave , question ,as to
whether Cuba or Peach Mark would win
first. After intermission the brace were
turned down and ran for twenty-five min
utes. Again in this heat was high-class
work shown by each. . At the ciose tiie
judge announced the decision as follows:
First, \V. W. Van Arsdale's Englisn
setter Peach Mark (by Mercury-Betsy
Mark); second, Stockdaie Kennels' point
er Cuba of Kenwood (by Glettbeigh Jr.-
Stella); third, Stockdaie Kennels' pointer
Nellie Wilson (by Plain Sam-Dollle II).
The winner of the all-age stake. Peach
Mark, has only added to an already brill
iant' record -by winning first.' She took
third place in the Derby in 1596, first in tre
all-age 'in IW, first in the all-age in 181-8
and again to-day, making three successive
winnings, as she was not entered in ISW.
Her work throughout the trials was very
even, and thougn not as brilliant as that
of some of the others it was always con
sistent. , ir
After the conclusion of the race \V. S.
Tevis, president of the club, announced
that he had provided lunch lor the entire
party, and ail were invited to the table,
which was spread upon the grass near the
trial grounds. Immediately afterward
entries were opened for the champion
stake, but only two were offered. These
were Stockdaie kennels' Sam's Bow, and
the winner of the all-age. Peach Mark.
After two hours' intermission the two
dogs were cast off for this event, which
was to be of two hours' duration. After
a short run a bevy of birds was found in
an open and the most brilliant heat of the
trials followed.
Peach Mark should have been somewhat
tired after her morning's work, but did
not show it, and Sam's Bow, as if aware
that he had an antagonist worthy of his
skill, put. up a most excellent perform
ance. The birds were worked from the
open field Into a vegetable garden, and it
was point and back, point and back until
the spectators became tired keeping tally.
At one time Peach Maik seemed to have
the better of it, but made a blunder by
not honoring one of Sam's points, which
again put them on an equality. After one
1 our and a half had expired the dogs were
taken to the timber, where a large bevy
was flushed and Sam's Bow made a bevy
point soon afterward at the edge of an
opening. The dogs were ordered up and
were so nearly equal in the race that this
one point decided the judge in favor of
Sam's Bow, and he was declared cham
pion. An impromptu meeting of the club
was held on the grounds, and as there
were but three entries for the members'
stake it was decided to declare it off and
return the entrance money, which was
done. â¢ ,
Sam's Bow, winner of the champion
stake, was winner of the all-age in 1899,
and is owned by the Stockdaie kennels. |
Several of the visitors and club members
will form shooting parties and remain
about Bakersfield for a few days.
Judge Johnson will try his skill on Cali
fornia quail for the first time, and after
three or four days' visit will go to San
Francisco, where he will remain for a
short visit.
The trials throughout have been suc
cessful and the Judging highly satisfac
tory. The club has extended a vote of
thanks to Judge Johnson for his excellent
work throughout the meeting.
SOFALA IS
BEATEN OUT
BY. DUNFREE
A Ragged Starl Contributed to
the Unbeaten Filly's Down
fallâOakland Results.
After sroring four straight victories
Barney Schrelber's unbeaten Balgowan
filly Sofala mot a reverse yesterday in the
two-year-old scramble at Oakland. She
went to the post a 7 to 10 choice over the
eleven other youngsters sporting silk, and
only a mishap prevented her from making
It five straight. Thorpe on Dunfree,
drawing the rail position, beat hit field
away, anil in a. driving finish led the first
choice out over a length. Headed into
the stretch, Sofala showed first, but tired
as the wire was neared. Lucidia, the
winner's stable mate, ran third.
Four first choices were toppled over.
With one or two exceptions, every event
furnished a contest. In bowling out Dr.
Nembiii.i, tho Burns & Waterhouse entry.
Dr. Shei>pnrd. p<jual<^l the coast record of
1:45%; lor one bfiile and a sixteenth.
Mike Daly, the New York horseman,
scored his lir:-t win at the meeting, with
Jael, in the opening scramble. There was
plenty of ;5 to 1 In thu ring, and the big
mare won. with Johnny Daly sitting up
straight in the saddlo. Almoner, the fa
vorite, lost the place to Mainstay in a
hard drive. , ".
It was only a romp for Andrissa, the
fast St. Andrew filly, to take the seven
furlong run for three-year-olds. Her first
start this season, she was backed from 9
to 10 to 1 to 2. She ran away from the
field. Hani ridden. Rachel C disposed of
Louis B. MeWhfrter for the place.
If Topmost had not been much the bet
ter horse Forte would have taken his
measure. The Shields entry was plunged
on at the short price of 3 to 5, and in a
drive lasting a sixteenth of a mile only
gained the decision over Forte by a head.
Jack Martin, astride the winner, did not
lose his head, holding Bullman safe de
spite the latter'a strong efforts. Weller
was the only other starter.
11l luck still pursues Dr. Nembula. for
he lost the mile and a sixteenth handi
cap by a neck, nfter the winner, Dr.
Bheppard, had beaten the barrier three
lenptljs. At the paddock Dr. Nembula,
who ruled favorite, looked a winner, when
Sheppard. responding again to Bullman's
hard urping, drew away, winning in a
gruelling drive. Flamora, with 90 pounds
up, was a bang up third.
Displaying rare good form, Novia, from
the Spreckels string, turned up a clever
winner of the six-furlong handicap. The
stable sent in a good commission on the
mare, and after leading from the start
she downed Ventoro by a couple of
lengths in 1:13%. May W, carrying 123
pounds, lost the show to Good Hope. The
winner was 4 to 1 in the ring.

ARMED MEN
FILL STREETS
OF FRANKFORT
Evidently Expected That the
Election Contest Board
Would Report.
LEFT AT NIGHTFALL
Colonel Williams Emphatically De
nies That They Were Memb9rs
of the State Militia.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 23.â A special
train bearing more than 1000 men carry
ing Winchester rifles arrived in Frankfort
at 8:30 o'clock this morning. The men
hail from the counties of Bell, Allen.
Knox, Harlan. Whlttler. Metcalf and Ed
mundson. Frankfort is overflowing with
visitors, but none except those arriving
to-day carry arms. Oovernor Taylor
stated to an Associated Press representa
tive th,at the men were not soldiers. He
disclaimed any knowledge of the identity
or purpVse of the armed visitors.
The m\n marched to the State House,
stacked t\eir guns and took up positions
in groups about the buildings. They were
all provided with badges bearing a por
trait of Governor Taylor, which they
pinned on th\ir breasts. Adjutant Gen
eral Collier states that he had no knowl
edge that the men were coming. Many of
the visitors are members of the State
Guard. The total number arriving on the
special train cannot be stated exactly.
The tram had fourteen cars.
Ex-Secretary of State Flnlay addressed
the visitors from the steps of the State
House. He said the gathering was to see
Justice done. A committee was appointed
to draft resolutions. Stephen Sharp of
Lexington was chosen chairman.
The resolutions committee drafted the
following to be presented to the Legis
lature:
We, Kentuckians. her* assembled in token
of all the "free and equal" men of Kentucky,
do reassert the "great and essential principles
of liberty and free government," proclaimed in
the bill of rights, not as derived to us there
from, but as "inherent."
Our property we may alienate from ourselves
and our children, but liberty Is a heritage to
us In tru6t for all Generations, and we may
neither surrender nor encumber It. We de
clare apaln the prerogative right of freely com
municating cur thoughts and opinions; also,
to assemble together in a peaceable way for
our common good and the good of our fellow
men of Kentucky. More especially do we de
clare our right and authority, conferred on us
by Almighty power, and not otherwise, of ap
pealing to those Invested with the power of
government, by either petition cr remonstrance,
and we represent to them, our brethren of Ken
tucky, our agents in the Legislature convened,
that the government of Kentucky Is founded
on our authority and institute.l for our peace,
safety and happiness and the protection of
propertyâ our own and theirs, as well as that
of the stranger within our gates. We petition
them, our proxies in the General Assembly, to
heed that there is peril hovering over all those
things so dear to us and them, and that calm
ness and prudence and wisdom need be Invoked
in order that truth and justice may prevail;
and we exercise our rtght of remonstrance
against their suffering themselves to be led Into
the temptations of partisan pride in the crisis
which Is on us. We beseech them to remem
ber that their own Just powers were loaned
them by us at the polls, and that among these
was the Jurisdiction to decide Judicially and
by due process of law and not otherwise what
was then our expressed will, not their prt&ent
political preference. â¢
We Implore them that they do not, on slight
or technical pretexts nor flimsy or trivial
muses, permit the subversion of that supreme
law of the land, the will of the people.
We beg of them that they receive from the
hands of our messengers and consider and do
not spurn or despise this, our earnest address,
petition and remonstrance, and that they, by
their considerate action, protect, preserve and
promote the safety and welfare, and. above all.
the honor of Kentucky committed to their keep-
tns. CHARLES FINLEY.
DR THOMAS W. BERRY,
A. W. KAZOR,
CLAUDE CHINN.
The lower house of the Legislature met
at 11 o'clock and, on motion of Mr. Can
trell, Democratic leader, a resolution was
adopted excluding all but ladies from the
chamber and galleries.
Mr. Catron, Republican, asked the con
sent of the House of Representatives to
permit a non-member to present a reso
lution, but Speaker Trimble ruled that
nobody but a member could do so.
A rumor is in circulation, but is per
sistently denied, that Judge Cantrell of
the local Circuit Court has summoned all
Democratic deptuy sheriffs of the State to
Frankfort. The commonwealth's attor
ney, Franklin, says he knows of no such
order.
The armed men of the mountains, con
trary to expectations, on the advice of the
Republican authorities here, left Frank
fort at o'clock to-night. The consensus
of opinion here is that the visitors mis
took this for the day on which the contest
boards were to make their report.
The men were an hour getting aboard
their train and amused themselves during
the delay by discharging their guns. The
peoplo of the city gave them a wide
berth. They are expected to return when
the contest ends.
The arrival In Frankfort of this crowd
of SOO to 1000 armed men with rifles might
have terrorized a community less inured
to sensational happenings, but by night
fall the excitement caused by the ap
pearance of the warlike visitors had sub
sided and the people were prepared for
another turn in the events now making
history at the State capital. The train
that bore the armed men was made up of
fourteen coaches. Apparently but few
here knew that it was expected. Lunch
was served to the armed host at the rear
of the State House. While It Is generally
believed that many of the men were sol
diers, no person in authority will stand
tyxmsor for tho statement, while Gov
ernor Taylor and Adjutant General Col
lier disclaim any connection with them.
LEXINGTON, Jan. 25.â Concerning: the
claim that the armed men who went to
Frankfort from here to-day were part of
the State Guard and were under orders.
Roper D. Williams, colonel of the Second
Regiment, said:
"Some of these men may be members
of the State Guard, but no order has been
given for their assembling there. All
such orders would fro through my hands
and nonesuch have been received by me."

Fire the bodies will be sent home at the

The Astorian has this to say about the

well known in this port: "The British ship
Clackmannanshire, loaded with grain for
Europe, was found to be leaking badly
when she arrived down from Portland
and she is now tied up at the O. R. and
N. dock for repairs. On the trip down a
drifting log struck the anchor and drove
its fluke through one of her plates. This
was not discovered until yesterday morn
ing, when one of the men went down into
tho hold for some coal and dropped into
several feet of water. The injury is not
a serious one and the cargo is in no dan
ger. It is a matter of much surprise that
a ship with such a name did not strike
one of the numerous bars in the river and
sink out of sight altogether, wheat and
all."

NEW HEALTH BOARD'S STATUS
District Attorney Preparing Answer
to Dr. Lawlor's Suit.
District Attorney Byington is busy pre
paring the answer of the new Board of
Health in the suit brought by former
Health Officer Lawlor to give reason why
permission to sue should not be gmntoi
by the Attorney General. In discussing
his brief, which will be completed in a
few days. Mr. Byington holds that the
regulation of public health is a municipal
affair and should be controlled by the
municipal charters.
"The charters of practically all clti*"?."
pays the District Attorney, "in this and
other States jÂ«rovidÂ«* for a municipal
Board of Health. IhÂ«> constitution, of
course, provides for a State board, but
this docs not in any way act against the
prerogative of a municipality to provide
for a local board. . .:
"The 'barter endeavored to provide for
home rule in San Francisco, and its 1 ro
visioris 1 believe to be not only sound i-i
law, but also universally commende-l. It
has be*n held in a Michigan case that
wru-re the laws of the State, pro vide J for
a Board of Health in a township and an
other statute provided for one in a city
Â¦within the township the provisions appli
cable to the township Board of Health
did not control that of the city, but that
the city charter was paramount as to the
regulations applying to the municipality.
If it were held that the old Board r.f
Health exercised any Jurisdiction or pov
c-rs outside of the limits of this munici
pality, those powers might remain with it
but as to the duties which fall within the
province of the new Board of Health pro
vided for in the charter, and which are
strictly municipal duties, the charter Is
paramount, and the new board would
alone- control the said affairs."

ARCHITECTURAL PLAN.
Summer School Curriculum to Bs
Very Largely Extendedâ Wil
merding School Popular.
No frame house is to be built for the
home of the president of the University
of California. As it will probably be the
first structure to be erected under the now
university plans the Regents decided yes
terday that it should be of stone and of
such architectural beauty as to be at enre
an example and an inspiration for the re
mainder of the buildings. Having ar
rived at this decision, the Regents will
hold a special meeting to mature plans.
President Wheeler presented a report
setting forth his plans for the summer
school at Berkeley. He proposes to great
ly increase the number of subjects thit
teachers can take up, and will organize
the school on a solid basis. Instead of per
mitting it to continue as a segregated
system. Nearly 400 patrons of these sum
mer courses are expected this year and
the president believes that under the ne'-'v
organization the attendance will steadily
increase and that others besides school
teacheis will avail themselves of Ita ad
vantages.
A special committee created for the pur
pose of trying to find out the plans of
the Hastings Law College directorate in
regard to the Affiliated Colleges reported
its mission a failure.
"We sent a long letter to the directors
of the law college," said General Barnes
"and in one sentence, by way of reply
they tell us that they have no informa
tion to give usâ in other words, that it is
none of our business."
The committee was continued for the
purpose of learning the exact relationship
existing between the Regents and the law
college directors.
On the recommendation of the presi
dent. E. N. Prouty's resignation from the
institute of civil engineering was accept
ed, and A. E. Chandler was promoted to
the vacant instructorship.
G. D. Louderback, assistant professor in
the department of geology, having been
offered a chair in the University of Ne
vada, was permitted to resign, and \f
Calkins was promoted to the vacancy
Professors Joseph I^e Conte and William
Cary Jones were given a year's leave cf

tion during February, and Mrs. Hearst
Â¦was authorized to sign all requisitions
during the President's absence.
Two acres of land near Ukiah has been

idly Increasing. It was proposed to limit
the number to 150. but this was left to the
committee. The school opened with eip-hty
and now has 13.> students.

jury not only charged Dillon with the
crime, but found him guilty.
The verdict, after reciting that Joyce
was shot by Dillon on January 15 and died
cf his wound, went on to say:
"And we furthermore find the said
Thomas Dillon guilty of murder."
Coroner Cole approved of the verdict.

for Relief.
The North Central Improvement Asso
ciation is moving to have Clay and Mer
chant streets, between Sansome and
Montgomery, kept clean. An Inspection
has recently been made by representa
tives of the association and complaint has
been made against the fish dealers. Ed
gar Painter, secretary of the association,
has prepared a communication to be sent
to the Board of Health, which is in part
as follows: Â»
We respectfully call your attention to the
bad condition of the markets on Clay and
Merchant streets, between Sansome and Mont-
Komery. particularly amonp the flsh dealers.
Merchant street Is In r constant state of In
describable filth from the fact that the wash
ings of the fish markets are swept Into the
street and it Is not an unusual stpht to see
dead flsh among; the rubbish In the street.
We applied to the previous IJoard of Health,
but weie unable to secure any relief as they
said that It was out of their control. We
psk.*d them particularly to make a regulation
in the markets that rubbish should be re
movrd at least once a day at a specified hour
or as many times per day as may be deemed
nf . o ".--sary. The odors from the markets are
so disagreeable that It is almost imposÂ«ible
for property owners to rent property in the
vicinity.
We respectfully call your attention to Clay
street, between Pansome and Montgomery. At
the corner of Sansome and Washington streets
the large Nlantlc building is almost entlrely
vacant, three floors being unlet. Xext door.
at 512 Clay street, the lower floor Is vacant.
On the opposite side of the street almost the
entire floor is vacant and two large ground-
JEWISH LADIES MEET.
Israelitischtr Frauen Verein Elect
Officers and Tell of Their
Good Work.
Yesterday afternoon in the vestry-ro^m
of Temple Emarm-El the ladies of the lr>
raelitischer Frauon Verein held their an
nual meeting and election of officers. The
report of the president of the association,
Mrs. Henry W.ingenheim. showed that
during the year $437S 20 was expended in
charity, and that the largest portion of
this sum was spent in monthly stipends
for the support of aged charges, depend
ent widows, deserted wives and families
and the partial payment of rentals of the
society's poor.
Thf report of the secretary established
the fact that the society was in a flour
ishing condition. The total expenditures
for the year amounted to $5144 30 thÂ» total
annual inrom<? $472S 75, leaving a yearly
deficit of J4.*Â»l 5.J. As, however, the society
has a reserve fund in bank of $10.3!<3 54
th* small yearly deficit did not worry th*>
members.
After the reports of the president and
treasurer had been read the committee on
resolutions and by-laws submitted itfl re
port and offered a resolution to the ef
fect that the name of the society be
r hanged to the Women of Israel. It" was
decided to call a special meeting, when the
subject could be put to a vote.
The following officers were elected to
serve during the year: .President. Mrs.
Koso Wanconru-im: vice president. Mrs.
Sarah Goodman: treasurer. Mrs. Finny

CLERICS AT THE BOARD.
Pleasant Dinner of the Clerical Sem
inar at the Occidental Hotel.
Fifteen members of the Clerical Semi
nar sat down to dinner at the Occidental
Hotel last evening and, enjoying the good
cheer that had been provided by Major
Hooper, passed a pleasant evening in so
cial relaxation and In listening to ad
dresses on the history of the Episcopal
church in this diocese.
The Seminar is a society composed of
the younger members of the Episcopal
clergy, and the dinner last evening was
merely for the purpose of taking advan
tage of the presence of the members of
the organization that the convention had
brought together In this city and mixing
witH the more serious concerns of their
calling a little Jollification.
Rev. W. I. Kip Jr. acted as toastmaster
and made an address of an introductory
character, replete with wit. The subject
chosen for the speakers of the evening
was "The History of the Kpiscopal
Church in This Diocese," and was divined
into three parts. The tlrst part, "Light
Sketches of the Past," was handled by
Rev. "W. \V. Bours and Rev. W*. A.
Brewer. The speakers on the second di
vision. "Thoughts on the Present," were
Rev. D. Charles Gardner and Rev. H. S.
Hanson. Rev. T. J. Lacey and Rev. E. L.

ened with many a sparkling epigram and
Impromptu talk, delivered at the com
mand of the toastmaster, who kept the
others busy on a dozen different sub
jects.
MIAMI STRANDED
ON WHITE ROCK
No Hopes of Saving the
Big- Collier.
WAS BOUND FOR THIS PORT
?
NO EXPLANATION OF HOW THE
ACCIDENT OCCURRED.
VICTORIA. B. C. Jan. 23.â A disaster
for which no rational explanation has
yet been offered occurred this morning,
when the big steam collier MlamJ was
leaving 1 the coal chutes at Oyster Bay. in
Pilot Butler's care, and bound for San
Francisco, fully laden.
It was fair weather, and the pilot knows
the harbor like a book, yet the big 3000
ton steamer was piled on White Rock at
the entrance in such a position that every
hour makes it more certain that she will
eventually break her back and go to
pieces. No particulars or explanation of
the wrecking has been offered, and no de
tails can be secured at the office here of
Dunsmuir & Sons, save that this biggest
of their chartered colliers will be a total
loss.
Scows were sent up to-night by Steve
dore Yorke to strip the ship and save all
the coal possible. The Miami Is owned
in New York, and was worth $300,000. ShÂ«
had been cnarteder by Dunsmuir & Sons
for a long engagement in the trade from
the mines to San Francisco.

USELESS WORRYâ W. 8.. City. There
Is no way that you can stop publishers
in different parts of the States from
sending you sample copies of their re

you to worry about the matter. If you
receive a sample copy, that floes not bind
you to taking the paper. If the sending is
continued refuse the paper from the mail
carrier and send notice to the publisher
that you do not want his publications.
That will relieve you of responsibility.
our constitution and the functions and responsibili
ties of what is grandly termed "a world power."
Our prosperity, heretofore the most remarkable in
history, has been properly ascribed to the constitu
tional equality of our system of government. Decid
ing upon the American policy of protection and ap-v
plying to it the constitutional injunction upon Con
gress to "provide for the general welfare," we have
sheltered under its brooding wing the interests of
labor and capital alike. Have these interests now
reached the parting of the ways? Will we by extend
ing the principle of protection to tropical labor de
stroy the advantage it has heretofore so richly be
stowed upon American labor, but at the same time
gild commerce and capital more richly by giving
them the double advantage of protection and cheap
labor?
These are the difficult questions which porten
tously emerge from the Spanish war. All of the is
sues impinged upon it, which affect the materialities
of our people, must be regarded as domestic ques
tions. Unfortunately, up to this time the mind of the
country has been engrossed by what may be called
the sentimental politics presented by conquest
abroad. One side has considered the interests of the
conquered in the light of their inherent right to self
government. The other, equally conscientious, has
devoted itself to developing our duty to educate and
enlighten and raise up a people declared to be at pres
ent unqualified for even a small voice in their own
government. This contention has not prepared us for
present consideration of the commercial and indus
trial problems, which have sole and serious effect en
tirely upon our own people.
Our industries stand in battle array against the re
ciprocity treaties. They measure fairly the damage
those conventions threaten to American labor and
production. That damage has its radix in the cheap
labor of the tropics. The further issue is, will we
multiply the harm by adding to the small amount
of such labor in Jamaica the millions of tropical
toilers in our awn islands?

Duchow obtained the patent by falseiy
representing the land to be valuable for

was not valuable for timber at all. and
was valuable only for minerals, a fact
which Duchow knew at the time he made

THE OPEN DOOR.
OUR commercial policy in the Spanish islands
is approaching a crisis. We have just acted
for and with England in demanding of con
tinental Europe the guarantee of the open door in
China. This has been acceded to, and the commer
cial nations thereby agree to stand equally in the trade
of that empire. The issue is, shall they also stand
with us, equal in access to the trade expected in our
own tropical possessions? That is the English pol
icy. Wherever she is there is equal access to the
market. If we ordain free trade between ourselves
and our Spanish islands, will we concede the same
open door to the nations which we have by mild
duress forced them to concede in China?
If we maintain a tariff barrier between us and our
Spanish islands, will we. put the other nations on
an equality with us in that respect?
It is obvious that the hope of those imperialists
who have what Senator Wolcott calls "a sordid mo
tive" has been that the constitutional provision de
manding an equality of tariff rates throughout the
United States would be extended to these islands.
Such extension would establish free trade between
them and us, but would exclude the other nations to
the extent to which our protective tariff works such
exclusion. This would give to our capital and com
merce an exclusive and profitable advantage. It
would give us a monopoly as factors of the, island
products, and cutting them off from free exchange
with the rest of the world, would confine them to our
market in which to seek the supply of their necessi
ties for which they must resort to outside sources.
This advantage to our capital and commerce, how
ever, is countervailed by island competition with our
continental production, which employs millions of
American laborers at the continental scale of wages,
who must compete, therefore, with tropical labor at a
wage scale which cannot be evened with ours except
by reduction in the American wage scale and a retro
gression in the American standards of life.
Porto Rico makes the first demand for extension to'
her of our tariff, and therefore for free access to our
markets and for competition between her labor and
ours. This precipitates the combat between finan
cial and commercial interests and the' American la
borer and his wage scale. The reports indicate that
this contention is approaching its acute stage at
Washington.
Meantime all Europe is looking on, aware that the
Porto Rican settlement will be a precedent for the
Philippines. The nations that have surrendered to
our demand for an open door in the East are wait
ing to see if we will keep our own door in the same
region closed.
Our own people are also waiting to see if we will
try a variant and opportunist policy, which will pre
sent a closed door in the Western Hemisphere and
an open door in the Eastern Hemisphere.

EXPERTS DIFFER
IF the United States Senate ever contained two ex
perts in expediency and non-experts in principles
they are pre-eminently Tillman of South Caro
lina and Allen of Nebraska. Since Tillman en
tered the Senate with a pitchfork to exterminate- an
administration of his own party, and Allen appeared
bearing the commission of the Nebraska Populists,
they have hunted in couples. Their prey was not the
political aniseed bag, with which amateur pursuers of
the elusive fox amuse themselves. It was any and
every thinsr in the country that showed signs of thrift
and prosperity. The banks, insurance companies,
railroads, telegraphs, manufacturers, all and singular,
that seemed to be keeping out of bankruptcy offended
these two Senators, and they sleeplessly nagged at
them all, as if thrift were high treason and it was a
misdeameanor to be solvent and a felony to be out
side the poorhcrtise or jail.
Allen acquired a great physical reputation by
speaking for sixteen consecutive hours against the re
peal of the alleged Sherman silver bill in 1893, and
that performance, although in the presence of an
empty Senate ar.d applauded only by snores that
chorused from the cloakrooms, where the Senators
slept uneasily in their togas, planted the seeds of
green-eyed jealousy in the breasts of his Populistic
colleagues. It is known that some of them sent to
their constituents an accurate time schedule of the
speeches they made in the same session and on the
same subject, and claimed the right to join them all
together like links of sausage and consider them as
one speech, exceeding in longitude that of Senator
Allen. As far as material goes there was not lacking
a certain resemblance between the substance of these
speeches and that in which the substance of sausage
is inclosed for the market, so that the claim had a
certain merit. But still the palm remained with Allen,
and on his return to the Senate his reception has
not been cordial. His motions grow stale waiting for
a second from his side of the chamber, and in many
ways he is made to feel that he took an advantage
when he risked his lungs in that sixteen-hour speech
in 1893.
Recently he determined to do something that would
bring his Populist colleagues to his side, and so he
tilted his lance and rode headlong at trusts. Don
Quixote charging the windmills, or laying about him
at the flock of sheep, and wearing the barber's basin
for the helmet of Mambrino, never was more knightly
or errant than the Nebraska Senator. He saw trusts
on the face of the moon, and his caterwaul rose higher
than the bald pate of the bronze eagle that roosts on
the head of the Goddess of Liberty, who stands clothed
in verdigris and virtue on the Capitol dome. At the
end of his purely muscular exertions the Nebraska
Senator found himself antagonized by Tillman of
South Carolina, whom he immediately and hotly ac
cused of being a tool of the trusts. Tillman retorted
that Allen was a dog chasing a "hant." This
knocked Allen out as completely as Curran knocked
out the fishwoman by calling her an isosceles triangle.
He didn't know what a "hant" was, and by the time
he had consulted a South Carolina negro, wise in
the plantation idiom, and found that it is a ghost,
the occasion for getting back at Tillman had passed.
We fear these experts in misery and calamity hav
reached the parting of the ways. If Tillman says that
the trusts are merely "hants" and those who pursue
them are only like ghost-chasing dogs, we are un
able to see how they can ever get together again.
Castor snd Pollux have quarreled. Each must here
after play a calamity solo. That duet of misery, in
honor of insolvency, pestilence, famine and every
thing tj-phoid and bubonic, has been sung for the last
time.
Allen has paid the penalty of his staying qualities,
the Senate is avenged for the speech of '93, and a
solemn warning is issued to Senators who propose
oratory on the vaudeville plan of one continuous and
uninterrupted performance.

BRYAN'S LAST BATTLE.
WHEN Mr. Bryan pulled himself out of the
wreck of 1896 he gave his voice a vacation
while he wrote a book, called "The First Bat
tle." Its sale was limited td the orders taken before
its publication. As a political romance it was far be
low Coin Harvey's fiction. As a certificate to the
ability of its author it was even like unto that fur
nished by the works of the "Sweet Singer of Michi
gan" and "The Bard of Shanty Hill."
â¢ Colonel Bryan is now girding him for his last
battle. He is seeking some issue of expediency
which will act as a buttress to free silver and opposi
tion to our judicial system. He has declined to the
plane and place of a pretender to the Presidency.
Europe has been full of pretenders to thrones since
the English chair of state was pulled from under
James II by the convention of 16S8. Colonel Bryan
is the Don Carlos of American politics, and is pre
paring for a final struggle. It is impossible to find
amongst his nominal supporters, in Congress and out,
one who, when he sincerely utters himself, has the
least hope that Colonel Bryan can be elected. The
conviction is practically unanimous that his defeat
will be more overwhelming, his rejection more pro
nounced, than in 1896. Indeed it may be said with
perfect confidence that a large percentage of his
nominal supporters not only believe he will be de
feated, but hope he will be, and so wishing will con
tribute only a perfunctory support to his claims.
The Democracy faces the future unflushed by hope
of success. Its calmness is of despair, not of cour
age. It is like the patient ox depleted of strength by
the suction of a parasite he cannot shake off. His
hope is to outlive it, that the worm burrowed in his
back may die first.
As the Democrats in Congress have been de
bauched by Colonel Bryan until they have no prin
ciples to contend for, and as they dare not speak
freely their minds about their Mokanna, they are
driven to a policy of mere nagging of the Republican
majority. But even that fails to enliven the situation.
When a man is ill and begins to pick at the quilt with
his fingers all know that it means the end is near.
So the nagging of the Democracy in Congress and
in the country is recognized as mere picking at the
quilt on its deathbed, and rouses no sentiment ex
cept a curious pity.
Considering the Southern electoral votes as the
mere reflection of a local necessity and sectional preju
dice, and looking only upon the vote of those States
which are actuated by nationality alone, the re
election of President McKinley will more nearly rep
resent unanimity than any that has occurred since
that "golden age" of the republic, in which Monroe
became President.

THE RAILROAD IN POLITICS.
rROM the fact that Governor Gage called the
extra session of the Legislature only after a con
ference with W. F. Herrin and J. B. Wright of
the Southern Pacific Railroad it is evident that the
Kentucky corporation has not ceased its efforts to
dominate California politics, and is to-day engaged
with all its forces to elect Daniel M. Burns or some
man of the Burns stripe to the United States Senate.
When the stalwart Republicans of the Legislature
prevented the election of Burns at the regular ses
sion they baffled the railroad for a time, but by fail
ing to elect a worthy man to the Senate they left
open a way for the corporation to renew the contest.
The railroad managers were prompt to take advan
tage of the opening. Hardly had the Legislature ad
journed before the agents of the road were busily a:
work trying to obtain from the legislators pledges
that they would vote for Burns or some other rail
road candidate in case an extra session were called.
How far they have succeeded in procuring such prom
ises is not yet known, but since Herrin and Wright
and Burns have counseled the Governor to call the
extra session it is clear they have some reason for
expecting success.
Other circumstances of the call, however, afford a
reason for believing that while the conspirators ex
pect to attain their ends, they are by no means cer
tain. Were they assured of the votes required to elect
their candidate it would not have been necessary for
them to resort to such a transparent trick as that of
summoning the Legislature to assemble within six
days from the date of the summons and to arrange
for taking a vote on the Senatorial question on the
very next day after the Legislature assembles. The
evident determination to hurry the business through
before the people have time to protest shows that
there is weakness somewhere in the programme and
that to avoid a break the corporation and its allies
have had to resort to the tactics of desperation.
Such, then, is the situation that confronts the Re
publicans of California. By the man whom Repub
licans elected to the office of Governor the Republi
can party has been betrayed to the Kentucky corpora
tion; and two Democrats in the employ of the cor
poration, W. F. Herrin and J. B. Wright, are per
mitted by the Governor to arrange in secret a pro
gramme which Republican legislators are expected 'o
carry out. It is a situation so monstrous in its nature
that no precedent for it can be found in our politics.
Of course the Southern Pacific Company cares
nothing for the good repute of California, nor for the
honor of the representation of the State in the Sen
ate; neither do Herrin and Wright care anything
about the interests of the Republican party in the ap
proaching campaign. As a matter of partisan politics
indeed they would be glad to see it fall into the ditch
they have induced the Governor to dig for it. All
that is clear enough, and, therefore, from the stand
point of the railroad and of its Democratic agents the
conspiracy may be regarded as a very clever piece of
political trickery, but what do the Republicans of the
State think of it? What is the judgment to be pro
nounced upon it by men whose political fortunes and
the maintenar.ee of whose political principles are at
stake upon the issue?
Had the conference between Gage and the railroad
agents remained secret and unknown to the public
the danger of the success of the conspiracy would
have been great. Fortunately, The Call has been
able to expose it in time for the people to organize
for resistance. If that be done promptly and reso
lutely the final victory for genuine Republicanism
cannot be doubtful. The importance of the issue,
however, must not be overlooked. The Republican
party is at last face to face with the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. There is no longer any concealment
or evasion. The Republicans of the Legislature are
now to show forth openly before the whole State,
whether they accept orders from the Democratic
bosses of the railroad or whether they are true rep
resentatives of the people who elected them and trust
in them.

Governor Gage In his call for an extra nessloh of the Legislature gives six
teen reasons for so doing. Reason 1 laâ Elect a. United States Senator. me
other fifteen reasons are as thin as the thinneat kind of charity soup. It seem Â»

â¢ â¢ â¢
RED BLITKP SENTINEL
The long-talked-of extra session of the legislature has been called by Gov
ernor Gage to meet at Sacramento next Monday. The first reason given ror
calling It is the election of a United States Senator. The other fifteen reasons
for the call relate to legislation In regard to the San Francisco water front,
the State Board of Public Works, the wide-tlra law, the location of mining
claims, sale of school lands, tho Lunacy Commission, to remove appointees ror
cause and to confirm appointees. It has been frequently stated that the ext f a
session would be called to elect D. M. Burns Senator, and his friends are mm 8 -*"
ing /Ul sorts of claims, just as they did at tho regular (session. As the Sentinel
has frequently stated in the pas.t, the people of California know Burns ana an
overwhelming majority do not desire him as their Senator. We, furthermore, ao
not believe that he will ever secure 61 Republican votes to elect.
â¢ â¢ â¢
HEALDSBURO TRIBUNE
Governor Gage has called an extra session of the Legislature to convene on
Monday next. The ostensible purpose is to pass or amend a number of acts. Dut
the real object of convening the State body la the election of a United fatatea
Senator. It is pretty well known whom Gage desireÃ to have the Legislature
<-lect, and the opening of this dictatorial masked battery is not a surprise to the
State. The election of Dan Burns is not desired by the honest Republicans of
California, and to secure sufficient votes to elect him there must be a falling
down of those who so nobly and honestly resisted his election through a battle
of 104 ballots. On the last ballot Burns received but 30 votes, 61 being required
to elect. Is the Governor assured that he has secured that number of votes,
and is he convening the Legislature on a sure thing? We opine not. Nor do
we believe that a sufficient number of votes can be obtained to elect Burns,
and place this State in opposition to the Republican party at the national elec
tion next November. The election of Burns will surely do this thing, and on
those v.ho vote for and. thus secure his election will rest the responsibility of
disrupting the Republican party in California for the time being.
Â» â¢ â¢
LOS ANGELES TIMES
The log jam has at last broken and California is In for an extra session of
the Legislature, the Governor of the State having, at . noon yesterday, Issued
a proclamation to that effect, giving sixteen different and distinct reasons why
the taxpayers of the State should be called upon to pay the expenses of a ses
sion of the Legislature for which there is no demand on the part of the people,
and which has for its purpose the election of a notoriously incompetent and un
fit man to the United States Senate to take the place of that distinguished
statesman and honorable man, Stephen M. "White of Los Angeles.
The people of California must now face this calamity with a stout heart,
resolute purpose and unflinching determination to defeat the unholy ambition
of Daniel M. Burns to represent California at the nation's capital.
The Times does not believe that there are enough men In the Legislature of
California so lost to self-respect and so indifferent to public opinion that they
will fall down to the small boss who has forced himself into a candidacy which,
should it prove successful, means a disgrace to the State, a reflection upon the
intelligence of this people, and an affront to every good citizen who is jealous of
his honor and proud of the land in which he makes his home.
Still the Burns gang is rich in expedients and unscrupulous to no end, there
fore if the nefarious purpose for which an extra session of the Legislature has
been called Is to be defeated there must be an immediate consolidation of the
forces In opposition to Burns, looking to the election of a candidate who poss
esses the elements of statesmanship, and who has the confidence of his fellow
citizens. It is clearly apparent that an attempt has been made to take snap
judgment by calling the Legislature to convene next Monday at noon, with the
hope that the Burns opposition will be unable to mobilize their forces and destroy
that individual's chances of election. The conspirators are as likely to be mistaken
In this as they were mistaken last winter when they asserted, day after day,
that Dan Burns would surely be elected.
Every. member of the Legislature understands that a vote for this notorious
candidate means political damnation to the man who casts that vote. The leg
islator who desires to commit hara-kiri will never find a better opportunity than
he will have at Sacramento next week by casting his ballot for a man who Is
unfit .to hold even the smallest office within the gift of the sovereign people.
That man is Daniel M. Burns.
It Is the duty o fthe decent and honest members of the Legislature to get to
gether and agree upon a candidate and to stay with him, even though this extra
session should last until the crack of doom. California must not be disgraced!
â¢ â¢ â¢
TULARE DAILY REGISTER
ThÂ© Register will not attempt to predict whether or not the extraordinary
session of the Legislature called by Governor Gage will prove a fiasco and the
serious undoing of the Republican party. There is but one irreparable mistake
that it can make and that is to elect Dan Burns to the United States Senate. All
else will be forgiven it co that be not done. The test is simple and crucial.
The people of the State are in dead earnest. It is likely also that Burns and his
touts are in dead earnest, too, ami will leave no stone unturned to secure the
election of the head of the San Francisco push to the Senate of the United
States. Dan is not a man to let go until he is forced to let go.
"\\'e will not say that the election of Burns will cost the Republican party the
State of California in the next election, but we will say that the hazard will be
great and needless and that whatever befalls Burns or his party no man who
supports Burns will have a political future. A caucus should not be consented
to nor participated in unless it is previously determined that such caucus can
not be controlled In Burns" interest. The risk is great. The people "are
watching with an intensity of interest that has not characterized them for many
years and if they aro betrayed into the hands of the one man who, of all men
in the State of California, represents in the public mind the embodiment of all
that Is most objectionable in the political life of the State, those who be
tray them will not live to outlive the odium that will be heaped upon them.
Extenuations and apologies are and will be in vain. The people know that
Dan Burns owes his political eminence to being at the head of the San Francisco
push, that he is and essays to be the boss of the Republican party of the State
of California, and the idea of electing such a man to represent California in the
Senate of the United States is obnoxious to every honest-hearted man and woman
in the State, whether Republican, Democrat of what not. This is no time to
mince words or to have patience with those who confuse the issue. The man
who will cast his vote for Dan M. Burns for United States Senator will be
branded by the people. Justly and indelibly, as a traitor to his party and his State
and an enemy to clean politics and to a self-respecting constituency and good
government.

HENRY CLAY
manifested itself In the little backwoods
town of Lexington, and Clay's practice
grew apace.
The brilliant young lawyer was very
naturally attracted to a political career,
and his talents Joined to a winning per
sonality gave him easy entrance to the
political field. In 1803 he was elected a
member of the Kentucky State Legisla
ture, and three years later he took his
seat in the United States Senate to fill
an unexpired terra. He was the youngest
man who ever gained admittance to that
body, which by general custom has al
ways been what the origin of its name
implies, the assembly of the elder 3. In
deed, Clay lacked three months of the
constitutional minimum of thirty years.
At the end of his first Senatorial term
he was returned to the Kentucky Legis
lature, and in ISO 9 he was again sent to
the United States Senate to fill an unex
pired term. Meantime he was acquiring
increasing influence in the national coun
cils, although his opportunity for great
distinction had not yet come.
In ISII he became a member of the nn
tional House of Representatives and was
immediately made Speaker. The tranrfcr
from the Senate to the House may sesm
a step backward, but the ardent young
statesman found the larger body in closer
touch with the people, a field more conge
nial as well as influential.
The War of 1812.
When he entered the House our rela
tions with England were assuming criti
cal form. Napoleon and England had
been at war for several years, and the
restrictions which the European belliger
ents had placed upon commerce with
neutral nations had destroyed a consider
able part of our trade. Our feeble at
tempts at retaliation in the non-importa
tion act of 1806 and the embargo of 1807
had failed. Meantime England was vig
orously asserting the "right of search'
and had impressed into her service sev
eral thousand sailors from our ships.
Americans were exasperated and ready
for extreme measures. Henry Clay raised
his eloquent voice in vehement denuncia
tion of English oppression, and in a se
ries of ringing speeches he demanded de
fense of American honor through aggres
sive war. President Madison hesitated
long but the influence of Clay and his
party carried the day and war was de
clared In 1812.
The Missouri Compromise.
When he next took the center of the
political stage he made his first appear
ance in the role for which he is chiefly
distinguished in American historyâ that
of the "great pacificator." In 1818 Mis
souri applied for admission as a State,
and for the first time there was distinct
alignment of North against South over
the slavery issue. At that time only a
few enthusiasts dreamed of interference
with slavery in the States where it was
already established, but an influential
party in the free North was determined
that the new territory should not be pol
luted A proposal that Missouri be ad
mitted on condition that no slavery exist
within her borders precipitated the "irre
pressible conflict." It raged fiercely until
Clay the statesman of compromise, lent
his powerful influence to the proposal of
a Senator from Illinois that Missouri be
admitted without restriction as to slav
ery but that in all the rest of the terri
tory west of the Mississippi known as the
Louisiana purchase slavery be forever
prohibited north of the parallel 36 degrees
30 minutes, this being the southern boun
dary of Missouri. The Missouri compro
mise of IS2O is the first of three notable
compromises between North and South
which stand to the credit ol the "great
pacificator."
Clay and . Jackson.
Soon after this Clay entered upon the
heartbreaking race for the Presidency
which was to last for nearly a generation.
The election of 1824 gave Jackson 93 votes.
John Quincy Adams 84, Crawford 41 and
Clay 37 As no candidate had received
a majority, the election devolved upon
the House of Representatives, but as the
choice was confined to the three highest
on the list Clay was out of the contest.
Now aroee a curious situation. Clay was
supreme in the House, and although he
could not procure his own election, the
defeated candidate held the glittering
prize he himself coveted at his absoluto
disposal so far as his three rivals were
concerned. As President-maker he
ignored Jackson, who had received the
largest electoral vote, and chose John
Quincy Adams. Adams made Clay Secre
tary of State.
That good hater, Andrew Jackson, now
turned the full curent of his hate upon
the man who had denied him the Presi
dency, and raised the cry of "bargain and
corruption" over the appointment of
Clay to the Secretaryship of State. In
the bitter personal fight that followed the
partisans of both leaders descended to
depths of political depravity that had
never before been sounded in American
political life. The feud between Jackson
and Clay ended only with death, and the
personal strife had great influence In
molding political results.
The Tariff Compromise of 1833.
The protective tariff was now threaten-

Ex-Secretary of the Consulate Is
Charged With Obtaining Money
by False Pretenses.*
Hlpollto P. Cadot. formerly secretary
in the office of the Chilean Consul, was ar
rested on a warrant yesterday afternoon
charging him with obtaining money by
false pretenses. The complaining witness
Is Juan Astorga Perelra, Chilean Consul,
and the particular charge Is that Cadot
obtained JSS from Sussman, Wormser &
Co., as excessive fees on Invoices. It Is
claimed that the total amount will be
considerable.
Cadot says that his arrest is the result
of a threat made by the Consul to ruin him
because he refused to remain in the office.
He was in the office of the old Consul
and three months ago, when Pereira was
appointed, Cadot agreed to remain on the
understanding that his salary would be
raised. He left January 1 and was per
suaded to return. He remained for a
week, but as there was no appearance of
a raise he quit altogether. He makes a
number of charges against Perelra of
charging and pocketing excessive fees on
invoices. He admits that J5 overcharge
was made against W. R. Grace & Co. for
extra work done by him, of which Pere
ira retained half.

XV. HENBY CI*AY.
BY FREDERIC W. SPEIRS, PH. D.
An adequate biography of Henry Clay
would require as its background a com
plete sketch of the political history of our
country during the first half of this cen
tury. As Speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives, as foreign envoy, as Secretary
of State, as Senator and as perennial can
didate for the Presidency the statesman
from Kentucky was a factor of command
ing importance In every political struggle
from the administration of Madison to
the election of Buchanan.
Early Career.
Henry Clay was born in 1777 In Virginia.
He received scant education, but he made
excellent use of his limited opportunities
and presently found an open road to the
study of law. At 21 he decided to try his
fortune in the frontier country of Ken
tucky, so In 1797 he became the adopted
son of the State which he was destined
to represent In CongreÃS so long and so
ably. The remarkable power of oratory
which was later to sway a nation soon
Clay's Statesmanship.
The end came soon after the last great
triumph of his favorite policy of com
promise. In June, ISo2, Henry Clay died.
Few public men have been more sincerely
mourned. He had enemies In abundance,
but even they recognized the great ser
vices of the veteran statesman. His long
public life had revealed some inconsisten
cies and some concessions to personal am-
Mtlons. but on the whole his career ex
hibits a singularly pure devotion to high
ideala of broad statesmanship.
He was not a great constitutional law
yer nor a profound political philosopher.
In these respects he was distinctly infe
rior to his great contemporary, W ebster.
But his brilliancy dazzled when his logic
did not convince. The matchless charm
and the moving power of his oratory
swayed Congress and the people as they
have rarely been swayed c>y any public
man. The never failing courtesy of his
manner and his skill in handling men
made him the greatest political leader
of his day. and Henry Clay is sure of
an honorable place In history among th*
very greatest of American statesmen.
ing to cause serious conflict between
North and South. In 1824 Clay had ap
peared as the champion of a high pro
tective tariff. In a series of speeches
more remarkable for their eloquence than
their logic he had urged the merits of tha
"American system." as he christened it.
In 1828 a still higher schedule of duties
was imposed, and then the agricultural
South began to get very restive under a
system which the Southerners felt was
benefiting the manufacturing North at
their expense. When the tariff bill of 1532
was passed South Carolina, under the
lead of Calhoun. made her famous nulli
fication ordinance, declaring that the
tariff act was null and void within tha
boundaries of South Carolina, thus assert
ing the doctrine of State sovereignty and
threatening secession. The specter of
disunion loomed large, and the country
was In great agitation when, in 1<33, the
statesman of compromise brought for
ward a tariff bill proposing a gradual re
duction of duties during a period of ten
year, so that by 1842 the tariff on dutiabla
goods would reach a uniform level of 20
per cent. The adoption of the tariff com
promise of 1533 soothed the South, and
Clay had scored his second triumph as the
great pacificator.
The Struggle for the Presidency.
Clay had now entered the Senate arj.l
from that vantage ground he led the
Whiff party In Its
fight against Jack
son and his admir
ers. Meantime he
was enacting the
great tragedy of hi*
political life. hl3
never ceasing, fruit
less attempt to at
tain the Presidency.
In 1524 he had tho
office within his gift
and had given it to
Adams: In IS2S he
had not been a can
didate, hut In 1533 he
received the unan
imous nomination of
j\ the Whig party, only
Â£fc,N to be overwhelminpT-
Bff!^ ly defeated by Jack-
PpgÂ£\. son. In 1536 the
V- Whigs were divided
jr isgfc - and dispirited, and
?~ -Jlsx\ went into the- cam-
V paign without mik-
V ing a national norn-
V \ ination. The result
vv~Â». \ was Van Buren'i
S&Z <fcr-^\ election by a larje
\ â¢ - JTySi Â»J majority.
\<^*v& In 1840 Clay had a
Â£^ \ plurality of votes tn
' the Whig nomin
ating convention at
the outset, but by
shrewd political
trickery he w a
turned down In fa
vor of Harrison. The
Whigs won the elec
tion, but their real
leader was not In
the Presidential
chair. We can syin-
pathize with Clay's
comment when he read the news of
Harrison's nomination: "I am the most
unfortunate man in the history of par
ties; always run by my friends when Bure
to be defeated, and now betrayed for a
nomination when I, or any one, would be
sure of an election."
In 1544 and IS4S his words were to re
ceive confirmation. In 1544 he was nom
inated by acclamation aa the Whip can
didate, and he lost the election by the ae
fection of the anti-slavery vote in th*
State of New York. In IS4S he failed to
receive the Whig nomination by a narrow
majority, and for the second and last time
his party won the Presidency. This was
his last fight. When nominations for
1802 were discussed his health was much
impaired and his ambition was deal.
Three times he had been through hard
fought campaigns, only to meet defeat,
and twice he had narrowly missed nom
ination when nomination would have
meant election. He had sacrificed much
for his ambition. In the main he steered
a straight course during his long political
life, but occasionally he veered from con
viction in a manner whlth forces the con
clusion that he was trimming his sail 1 *
to catch a Presidential breeze. He had
nobly declared in the oft-quoted phrase.
"I would rather be right than be Presi
dent," but his conceptions of right w*re
sometimes molded, perhaps unconsciously,
by the exigencies of his candidacy.
The Compromise of 1850.
One great political service remained for
the statesman who was now approach-
Ing the end of his career. The relations
between North and South over the slav
ery issue were under constantly increas
ing strain. When the admission of Cali
fornia and the organization of the new
territory in the Southwest which we had
acquired from Mexico came under discus
sion In Congress the controversy over
slavery became co violent as to portend
disruption. At this crisis Clay, now an
old man In fast failing health, brought
forward his third great compromise meas
ure, and in a two days' speech, which at
tained the highest levels of his wonder
ful oratory, he urged mutual forbearanca
for the sake of union. The well-known
compromise of ISSO, as finally adopted,
provided for the admission of California
as a free State, for the organization of
New Mexico and Utah without slavery
restriction, thf prohibition of the slave
trade In the District of Columbia, and
finally a more effective fugitive slave law.

MLLE. TREBELLI'S
POWER TO PLEASE
Mile Trebelli's power to please was
abundantly tested last night at her sec
ond song recital. The audience was not
exactly formidable In size, but filled the
hall quite comfortably and was generous
In its applause.
Mile. Trebelli's power to please may not
be questioned, for she has some of the
most charming qualities that can grace
a concert singer, an agreeable style, a
charming personality, a good natural
voice and considerable art. Yet she 13
far from being great and in some respects
she is absolutely disappointing.
I hesitate to judge the merits of asinger
whom I have heard only in Sherman,
Clay & Co.'s Hall, for the poor acoustics
of the place are a serious handicap to
contend against, as I know from having
heard voices fail utterly to please there
that elsewhere were enjoyable. But mak
ing allowances for the hollow mockery
of the human voice that the hall treats
us to there is a hard quality in the mezzo
soprano of Mile. Trebelll that must be
acknowledged by the unprejudiced.
I could find no enjoyment in her declam
atory singing, which is delivered with lit
tle color and In which her tones are fre
auently of inequable pitch. If we dif
ferentiate the attack and the production
in her singing she may be commended for
the first but will be found at fault In the
second, 'in the parlance of aquatics she
starts her stroke well, but "finishes"
C Neither is her phrasing artistic, nor her
breathing unlabored. For example, in the
line "En ecoutant sa voix melodieuse et
tendre," from Massenet's "II Est Doux,
11 Est Bon," one does not like to hear a
gulp between "volx" and "melodieuse,"
and in that capital song of Clapisson,
"Chanson de la Promise," the marked
hiatus between the words "liqueur" and
"vermeille" may not be considered neces
sary, because It assists the flourish at the
end of the phrase.
I was disappointed, too, in Mile. Tre
belli's inadequate dramaticism and In her
two excerpts from Italian opera. "Caro
Nome" and the Baletella from "I Pagli
acci " in which she might be expected to
shine, she fell far short of expectations.
And yet Mile. Trebelli's power to please
may not be questioned. In the "Taran
telle" of Bizet and the "Ho Messo Nuovo
Corde" of Gounod and. Indeed, all num
bers that demanded spirited rendering,
she was positively charming. Above all,
in the "Laughing Song" that she gave for
a final encore her charm of manner, her
delightful espieglerie won her the most
complimentary, sincere and well-deserved
applause.
Mile. Trebelll will give a final recital
on Saturday afternoon. The programme
Is. as usual, an interesting one.
PORTER GARNETT.
VEXATIOUS QUARANTINE.
Coal Importers File a Protest Against
an Unprofitable Delay.
Owners of vessels engaged In carrying
coal from British Columbia ports to San
Francisco complain of the delay caused
by the rigid quarantine prevailing at this
port. There is a scarcity of the fuel at
present In California, they say, and every
day's delay in unloading means great in
convenience and some financial loss to the
importers. i- v-;~v -;~
They forwarded yesterday to the Sur
ceon General and the Secretary of the
Treasury a strong protest, numerously
signed, asking for the removal of the
Quarantine restrictions on their trade. In
the protest they call attention to the fact
that they are in the freight business, not
in the passenger traffic, and for that rea
son the necessity for so strict a quaran
tine and so much delay is not apparent.
They represent further that they are
engaged in supplying the public with a
necessary of life, and that it is for the
public Interest that the period of delay in
furnishing the same should be reduced to
the minimum.
EXCESSIVE BILLS FOR
FODDER AT THE JAILS
LARGE SUMS PAID FOR HORSE
FEED.
Sheriff Lackmann Says Thirteen Ani-
xnals Cost Five Times Their Value
to Feed for Six Months.
Sheriff Lackmann Is of the opinion that
the expenses for maintenance of branch
jails 2 and 3 for the six months ending
December 31, 1599, under his predecessor,
were largely in excess of what they
should have been. In going over the ac
counts yesterday he discovered that the
forage bills for thirteen horses for the
first half of the present fiscal year aggre
gated $1506 90, which is nearly half of the
total sum expended for the two institu
tions, amounting to $2983 14. The horse
shoeing for fifteen hdrses. Including that
for the two van horses, which are stabled
privately, was $237 50, a total of $1744 40
for six months. The horses would bring
about $25 each In open market and at this
rate they have cost five times their value
for six months.
The cost for forage and shoeing for each
horse has been nearly $25 a month and
the Sheriff Is of the opinion that $12 50 Is
a liberal estimate for these Items for each
horse. Some thirty-two acres of land
la under cultivation near the Jall3, but
the Sheriff does not know whether any of
the grain has been made available. He
says that some was raised last year.
Repairing harnesses cost $212 85; black
smithing, $256 95; removing a dead horse,
$5/ and carrying a horse to hospital, $6,
making a total of $2274 20 for expenses of
horses and wagons. The other $.08 94 was
spent for Ice, telephones and other inci
dentals. .
As a consequence of the large expendi
tures, Lackmann finds himself with only
$2356 "3 for the next six months running
expenses of the two branch Jails, prin
cipally for the stable, and out of this the
Board of Public Works wants $1000 for
urgent repairs and locks for the cells. He
is willing to concede a portion of this
money, but thinks he will run short on a
fund already crippled. Lackmann thinks
that the forage bills may be reduced con
siderably and that at least $500 should be
saved on that Item alone.
REPAIRS IN INSANE
DETENTION HOSPITAL
BOABD OF WORKS HEARS RE
PORT OF SUPERINTENDENT.
Draymen's Association Petitions That
Foot of Spear Street Be Repaired
to Accommodate Traffic.
At the meeting of the Board of Public
Works yesterday a report was filed by
F. W. Hatch, General Superintendent of
State Hospitals, stating that he In com
pany with Mayor Phelan, Supervisors
Dwyer and D'Ancona and Commissioner
Manson had inspected the San Francisco
quarters for the alleged insane and made
the following recommendations:
The inside and outside of rooms used
for patients should be painted white, as a
sanitary measure and to lighten the
rooms, which are now quite dark. The
toilet, bathroom and kitchen should be re
moved from their present location and
placed in the back corridor. The space
thus created should be ntted up for the
detention of the noisy and untidy insane,
who are a disturbing element by reason of
their proximity to the quieter class of pa
tients. It would be advisable to build a
partition at the north end of the present
looms in order to keep visitors from run
ning along the hall and bothering patients
The report was referred to Superintend
ent Barnett for investigation.
The board announced the temporary ap
pointment of 110 laborers in the Bureau of
Streets, all of whom are hold-overs from
the Fragley administration.
A committee from the Draymen's As
sociation addressed the board regarding
the condition of the foot of Spear street
and its being closed for repairs on that
account. Complaint is made that it is
necessary to go over Harrison street hill
to reach the Oregon dock, and request was
made that the street be repaired at once
The board stated that there were no funds
available for good plank driveways, but
promised to begin the necessary repairs
as soon as possible.
City Engineer Grunsky was authorized
to investigate the mechanical device of
S. S. Tilson for flushing sewers.
H. Gray appeared before the board In
regard to the alleged nuisance maintained
by Gray Brothers in their brickyard in
the Casjro street extension. He Btated
that the grades of the land in that section
had not oeen officially declared and that
the blasting against which protest has
been made is two miles away from the
brick plant. The board will investigate
further into the matter.
The resignation of W. Wilkinson, assist
ant in the Bureau of Streets, was accept
ed, but the vacancy was not filled. .

Rev. Charles M. Sheldon Tells of the Tests
He Will Apply in His Forthcoming
Experiment,
TOPEKA, Kas.. Jan. 25.â Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, to whom the Topeka
Capital will be turned over for one week, beginning March 13, to run "as
Christ would conduct a newspaper if he were on earth to-day," is confi
dent of every success. Advance orders for extra copies of the edition and
requests for advertising space are continuing to pour in. Mr. Sheldon
will be in absolute control of the paper in its every department. Although he
has always been opposed to writing for Sunday papers and has declared they
should not be published the Sunday issue will appear as usual. In speaking of
his plans he said:
"1 intend to publish all the news, but I will present it In such a way as to
be entertaining and interesting, without its usual accompaniment of blood-curd
ling details and trash, which appeal only to the passions of the readers. I will
be at a disadvantage during my control of the paper, as I have never had
any newspaper experience. I intend occupying my time between now and March
13 in familiarizing myself with the work, bo that I shall not be totally ignorant
of it. The time is undoubtedly ripe for such a paper, and it would succeed as
well in Topeka as anywhere else."

BIG WRECK
ON COAST OF
NEWFOUNDLAND
An American Vessel
Driven Ashore.

ALL LIVES REPORTED LOST
Â»
OFFICIALS WOKKXNG TO FTNTS
NAME OF VESSEI*.
ST. JOHNS, N. F.. Jan. 25.â Advices
from Foxtail Point state that the wreck
of a large vessel, probably American, has
been on the rocks for four days. Nobody
appears to be on board and no signs of
boats are seen. The hull has been sorely
buffeted either before or after striking
the coast, and such portions of the wreck
age as lined the shore were split into frag
ments. The stormy weather prevailing
has prevented boats from getting near the
wreck.
It is beyond reasonable doubt that all
on board have perished, though who the
unfortunates -were and how many cannot
be determined.
The Government officials have arranged
to find out the name of the vessel If pos
sible.

Nay York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. X.-Price!, on the stock
Exchar-se at the opening to-day reflected in a
degree an improvement in London on the news
that General Warren had captured the Boer
jiOiition Â»t Siiion Kop. There was a brief
j>eriod of active buying by professionals In n
pectatioa that the SiJ^ll on the market would
be broken anj an outside demand for stocks
attracted, but the traders <juick!y detected that
there was no competition outside of their own
ranks in tbs demand for stocks and they turned
v. the sfcert elde almost Immediately. The
*ajrt,ing of price* below the London parity
ir.aoe operations profitable fcr the foreign
arbitrate houses since prices in London were
well susVuincd at the higher level. Buying
for foreign accounts in the international stocks
ira* estimated at from 2i.wu to 30.000 shares,
and even this demand was Largely met by
sales lor short account. The industrial spec
ialties rhowed Â«:a!n in Fvmi,athy with the in
ternationats. but they were not so well sus
tained In the absence of foreign demand. The
alÂ«olute inertness of the buying demand
jirompted some celling pressure by the bears
.:...Â¦.-â¢ the industr:als in the laii hour, but
prices fjr-onW as unwilling to move downward
k( upward, and the shorts covered befure the
clow, which was firm at slightly below the
opening level In most cas<Â«i. The weekly re
turns of the P.ank of KnÃlar.d and the Hank
of France disclosed a continuance 01 the no
table refiui. into the cash reserveu of thffr in
stitutions accompanied by continued liquUiu

to decrease owing to the large revenue re

London Markets.
NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The market opened flying to-day on the news
of the capture of Splon Kop by General War
ren and remained buoyant for nearly an hour.
The Issue, however, failed to come In and the
highest prices were recorded at 11 o'clock. Af
ter that hour dealings slackened, the second
thought being that the victory was Inconclu
sive. The reduction of the English bank rate
to 4" per cent and of the German bank rate to
3hi helped matters . somewhat, although
the action In both cases was a foregone con
clusion. Consols spurted to IC2, but closed un
changed at 101 S.
Americans opened buoyant and rose on a
misinterpreted Rueters dispatch regarding the
extent of the British losses at Spion Kop, but
the business done In them was small and It
dwindled to the close, which waa dull on proflt
taklng sales for New York. London Is nibbling
at bonds.
The bank received to-day Â£6000 of gold from
Portugal. It came out only to-day that the
governors had reduced the buying price of
eagles by 1 penny last Tuesday. Foreign ex
change was: Paris cheque, 25.19; Berlin, 20.49^.
The German bank rate is almost certain to
be reduced In a few days.

unsympathetic until he met Hackmeler a
few weeks ago. The latter took him to
his home, shared his bed and his food
with the soldier, and in return lost a
watch, which was pawned for $5. After
this Jones enlisted in the army under the
name of Wilson, but deserted again prior
to his arrest at the Instance of Hack
nieier.
When he was freed from jail yesterday
morning Jones was taken to Fort Mason,
where it was discovered that In addition

Eslabe exclaimed: "They talk about ma
being hard, but I'll tell you that Brandes
is a bad one, and my heart Is not half
as black as his. for I was not wholly re
sponsible for y*at I did."
ESLABE SAYS
HE WILL DIE
LIKE A MAN
THREE SUSPECTS
ARE CHARGED ON
THEIR RECORDS
He Will Be Executed
on April 23.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 25.
Before the sun sets on April 23 next
Joaquin Eslabe will have expiated his
crime on the gallows at San Quentln.
Judge Ogden for the second time pro
nounced the death sentence on the mur*
derer of Charles Gates to-day, and before
noon Deputy Sheriff Taylor was on hi 3
way to the penitentiary with the con
demned man.
Eslabe murdered Gates, who was a crip
ple. In the latter's tamale parlors. In a
l^fcement at Thirteenth street and Broad
way, early In 1898, with a piece of gas
pipe, beating his victim's brains out. On
May 24, IS9S, a jury convicted him of mur
der In the first degree and two weeks
later Judge Ogden pronounced the death
penalty; but the case was appealed and
execution stayed. A few days ago a rÂ«>.
mittltur from the Supreme Court an~
nounced the affirmation of the Judgment
of the Superior Court.
When Eslabe appeared before Judge Og
den this morning, accompanied by Attor
ney W. B. White, his face wore a deathly
pallor. When the court asked whether
he had anything to say why sentence
should not be pronounced, Eslabe stam
mered: "No, I have nothing to say. My
attorney might speak." But Attorney
White was silent, and the court ordered
Eslabe to be. taken by the Sheriff to the
Warden at San Quentin and by the latter
"hanged by the neck until dead," the ex
ecution to take place between 10 a. m. and
6 p. m. on April 23.
While awaiting preparations for his im
mediate removal to San Quentln, Eslab*
declared, with sickly bravado, that he
"knew he would be cinched from the
start."
"But I am not afraid to die, he conÂ»
tinued; "I will face the gallows like, a
man. I know my last chance Is gone, but
I'll be ready. They have treated me cruel
ly, not even allowing; my mother to see
me. and all my letters to her were stop-

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 25.
The quality of water furnished by the

wnÂ« of Oakland is not good. This is
shown by the analyeis of the water made
b> the city chemist, made by the order of
Mayor Snow. Two tests were madeâ one
Of the water from Lake Chabot. which
shows fermentation, and the other from
the Dingee wells at Alvarado. which
shows an unusual amount of salt anil
sediment.
These analyses were made by the re
tiring city chemist. Mr. Tolman. and were
furnished to Mayor Snow, who refused
to give them to the public on the ground
that such reports would Injure the city,
and it would be better to remedy the evil
without publicity. Councllmen Cuvellier
and Olrard to-*lay secured an opinion
from City Attorney Dew that these re
ports were public documents, and armed
with this they secured, the reports and
made them public. The reports show that
the water supplied to the city is In a very
bad condition.
The sample of water from Lake ChaV>t
wns taken from the house of Councilman
Cuvellier and Is analyzed as follows:
Free ammonia. .ISB parts per million; a'bu

per gallon: nitrates, traces: nitrites, slight.
This water presumably camp* from Lake Cha
bot and shows a decided change from the same
water of last summer and Indicates probablft
fermentation, as Indicated by the free ammo
nia and nitrites and nitratia. The albuminoid

for drinking water. The turbidity 1Â» not much
greater than la usual at. other seasons. The
odor on heating Is quite Strong and also Indi
cating fermentation. Armlytls made by I*. M.
Tolman.
The water from th*Â» DingeÂ© wells was
taken from the residence of Councilman
Girard, and the report reads:
The water from Mr, Glrard'a residence was
quite different. Thei,fe was a heavy, coarse
eediment. which settled readily on standing.
The sanitary analysis was quite different from
the others and vas evidently not from
the same source. There was an excessive
amount of common salt In the water, which
leads one to think It might have com* from
thÂ» Dlngee wella. There was an excessive
amount of albuminoid ammonia and If the wa
ter comes from the Dinaree wells it shows that
the walrr must have been contaminated from
some scftirca.
Free ammonia. .045 parts per gallon: albu

solids. 45 grains per gallon; oxyxpn absorbed.

The old water fight of years ago will
probaJSly bÂ« renewed, and as this Is th*
time when the Council fixes thÂ© wat^r
rates the fight Is likely to be on In full
force within a very short period of time.
COMPLICATIONS
ARISE OVER A
CITIZENSHIP
New Phase of Bridge
Controversy.
R. PERCY WRIGHTS INTENTION
He Brings Suit as an Alien and Is
Practicing as an Attorney
in the State
Courts.
?
Oakland OfHce San Francisco Ca'.l,
9CB llroadway. Jan. 25.
The citizer.ship of an attorney iias en
tered into th<> controversy that i;* now
heing waged In the courts over the Web
ster street CriiwLridge. Â¦ A few days ago
K. Percy WrltM, an attorney of San
Francisco, acting as a foreign plaintiff,
brought suit in the United States Circuit
Court to restrain the Alameila County
13nard of Supervisors from paying Cotton
Brothers the 132,000 yet due on the con
tract for the building of that bridge. Now
an investigation is being made into the
relationship which Mr. Wright bears to
this country in order to see whether he
can maintain an action in the United
States courts. The result of these inves
tigations to date show a somewhat
tangled condition of affairs with regard
to Mr. Wright's citizenship. Air. Wright
is an Englishman by birth, but has been
a resident of California for a. number of
years.
About a dozen or fifteen years ago the
State Legislature passed a law which al
lowed foreign-born attorneys to practice
In the courts of the State as soon as they
had declared their intention of becoming
citizens of this country. Under this law
quite a number of foreign-born attorneys
aeclared their intentioa of becoming citi
zens of the United States, and were there
upon admitted to practice In the State
courts. Among tnese was K. Percy
Wright, who has been practicing in the
courts of California under that authoriza
tion for a dozen years or more, liut Mr.
AVrlght never did more than to declare
his intention of becoming a citizen.
Though the years have passed he has
never fulfilled his intention, and tnia is
admitted in the suit that ne brings in San
Francisco over the Alameda County
bridge. In order to bring the suit within
the jurisdiction of the Federal courts he
was compelled to set forth that he was
not a citizen of this country-
Now the contest over the bridge has be
come so bitter that this matter of history
will he brought up, and it will be charged
by those whom Wright has sued that
either he is not entitled to practice In the
State courts because of his failure to ful
fill his intention and become a citizen or
he is not entitled to bring this suit In the
Federal courts because he is or should be
a citizen.

Scr.atrr Ftratton called the mÂ«>pting to
order and made a pracrful little Fpeech in
which ho said that this movement repre
sÂ«Â»nted th<^ dawning of Oakland's prosper
ity, and ho n-prftted that the extra ses
sion of the I^-jrjsiaturp would takp him
away from active work for th<T bonds. He
tht'n proposed that a complete organiza
tion be effected at once, and a set of by
l.-iwp uraa adf>jÂ»tfÂ»d providing for ofHcers,
puti-oommittccs and regular dues. Two
thirds of the moml>r-rp of the commit
!f" were present, and the absentees sent
Utters of regret. Warren Olney was cho
sen chairman without a dissenting voice,
and he made a short address.
"Senator Stratton has w<-ll paid that
this is the dawning of Oakland's pros
perfty.*' s-a'd Mr. Olner. "This is the
most important move that haF been made
for the city sin<-<Â« its organization fifty
rears ago. We must go about this with a
Â¦:> t.rrtii nation to work and to accomplish
something. We can hopo for but little
from political moves and from political
bodies, but Each a move as this can com
mand succrss if we will bend our ener
n<? to work. Sow is the time to do
something for Oakland."
The* other officers were then elected as
follows: Fim vice president. John A
Uritton; second vice president J S
Wixon; third vice prudent. A. Bchilling;
F^cretary. H. F. Gordon; treasurer, D. Ed
ward Collins.
The by-laws provide for an executive
committee of seven, one from each ward
which Chairman Olney asked a few days'
Sim* to select. John A. Urittnn suggested
That it was best to get right down to
work, and he mov-d that a sub-rommit
tee of five be namr-d to take in hand earn
rroposfd bond question, gather data upon
it. and finally present a report to the
general body of what they deemed best
for submission to the people.
On motion of Captain Gooda.ll, the sub
comrr.itteÂ« was reduced to three members,
md Chairman Olney asked time in which
to report those names.
The meeting: closed with sppprhps by
Oiles H. Gray. J. M. Haven. Captain
OoodsJl. John A. Hritton. J. P. Wixon. K.

CHILD'S TERRIBLE DEATH.
Thomas Hoeck Crushed to Death by a
San Mateo Electric Car.
Thomas Iloeck, four an 4 a half years
cf age. was knocked down by a car of
thÂ« San Mateo Elrctrlc Railroad yester
day afternoon on Bryant street, near
Seventh, and before the car could b#Â»
ftopp^d the unfortunate child was
dragged to death.
The little boy had crossed the street
from the residence of his grandfather.
Thomas Laughran, ?19 Bryant street, and
was about to return when the car bore
Oown on him. The- child peomed unmind
ful of the approaching danger and made
r.o effort to save Itself, and though the
wotorman applied the brakes with all
posidbte *pÂ«"eu, the little one was struck.
l.y the car and hurled to the ground.
As soon as the car was brought to a
rtop Conductor Ginity picked the child up
and carried it to the sidewalk, where the
grandfather, who had come from his
home to look for the little one, stood
speechless with horror.
William E. Irwin, the motcrman,
jun.ped and ran from the scene in all
haste, but was soon overtaken by Of
ficer O'Callahan and brought back. Cry
jr.g and tearing his hair, he declared that
he ;:ad done his best to prevent the ac
<-iÂ«ient. He was taken to the City Prison
and charged with manslaughter, but was
later released on bail. Mr. Irtvin declared
he did not see the boy until his car was
crlthln ten feet of him; that he made
< j ver>- effort to bring his car to a stop in
time to prevent the accident, but it was
impossible. He said he had turned off
the current before reaching the scene
and the oar was comj>letely under his
control, but the suddenness of the child's
appearance in front of the car prevented
him from avoiding striking him. He said
the car warn provided with a fender, but
that th<Â« child's body was bo small that
thÂ» fender pa. c Â«ed over it.
The mother of the child keeps a small
confectionary store on Twenty-ninth
â¢Â¦treet'and resides with her father at fÂ»l9
Bryant etreet. She has been a widow for
three ;cars.

Gcnran'a Hail was fjlied to overflow

and Tiansvaal flaps and Oom i'aul but

Burd'-tte Cornell cai'.ed tho meeting to
rrdrr and Miss Sannie Kruceri a niece
ct Oom Paul, sang a Boer ar.:hem. Mr.
Cornel! then introduced Mayor R. \V.
Snow as the chairman of the evening.
Mr. Snow said In part:
Under the Ptars and Stripps we are wont
to mtrt together whenever we cnoose to
dlicuu our own afTairs. A little republic In
Bcutb Air.ca is likely to l>e w.ped irr.m the
mrj>. absorbed by the Kreed cf a powerful
Doaarcby. The relationship is close. We
n.ako ,t <>ur affair and neet together to dls-
cufch it. It is undoubtedly the purpose of
â¢ rod that all the world shall ultimately teem
with men. It is alÂ»o decreedâ l care not
whfthtr you admit that a Supreme Being
has accrtv-l it or notâ lt is decreed by the
better man himself, the man whom you re
*pÂ«-ct r.bov<* all others among your lellows,
that men Ehall k.ve one another. Acknowl
edgment O f th<? nKh , F n ( men is love. There
is no j-art of love in injustice. When men
are unjust you are ofl>ndf.l. If the right
16 civÂ«n to you to mak<* the laws you Ftrlp
the offender of his power. Mon of peare
trarh us to meet injustice with prayer end
petition; others bid us to meet it by a call
to arms. Our fathers taught us to do both,
and I marvol at the forsetfulness and te
nirrity of England, that she dare at this
hour to renew the contest with a fiehtlne
man who also r'rays.
Th^y pay that the Afrikander never move;!
with the centuries; that the greedy r.in^
tffnth-century Englishman has discovered
him in the seventeenth. This mny be In a
sense true. Inate&d Â«>t the r*verl!<li anxiety
to rtow rich kly he tinds a man delight
ing in his isolation, loving his bare, wide
veldt where his rifle is also his shepherds
crook. The inlander would fain make him
rich against his will; Insists upon the adop
tion of a new regimeâ his regime. A vlgor
otu writer under this regime gays that the
I Itlander's Johannesburg "stinks of
money.*'
The land of the Transvaal was discovered
to be rich In goldâ gold for another 100 years
at the rate of $130,000,000 a yearâ and also
rich in c.vi and Iron. Then the Jamesun
raid, for which England said: VI am not
respotttibU": then the petition of March of.
lnst yeÂ»r ')>â¢ ir2,000 UHlatuler mon?y-getters,
asking that the Queen of England require a
republic to admit as citizens aa outnumber
ire horde.
Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills, pastor of the
Urst fnitarian Church, was the next
speaker. He was frequently cheered and
said in part:
I pymrathize with the BoÂ«>rs. but not be
<-HU.*e I believ* that Groat Hritaln is all
won*. I recognize the noble character and
achievement* of the I3riUnh j.*>ejile. I do
net think that her leaiiinc statesr.ien have
IT"*". * lulr >K UP nights for years planning
bloodthln-ty attacks upon the libtrties of
Â«Â»akor rations. But in an evil hour, her
worst enemies are In power, and the true
Enflar.J is misrepresented by her false
leaders.
Neither do I sympathize, with the Boers
because I think that they are all right. I
do not doubt that they have their faults and
that In many ways they have been un
jirogr^sjive and out of harmony with the
spirit of the age. In this contest my sym
pathies are with the Afrikanders who stand
representing- the fundamental principle of
human liberty.
England has clearly been the aggressor.
ThÂ» I nited States has as much right to dic
tate law in the Klondike or In Mexico,
which are beinc developed by American
capital, as Great Britain has In the Trans
vaal.
UoeÂ« the Intolerant, bloodthirsty, military
Fplrlt truly represent Kngland? Is a selfish,
greedy, grasping, ambitious, monocled sur
vivcr cf aristocratic tyrannyâ ln he Eng
land? Do not believe It. Great Britain con
tains people good, bad an-1 indifferent but
the truly Great Britain is as much above
the KhodÂ»ses and Chamberlains as the real
America Is superior to her plutocrats and
politicians.
Do you know that Herbert Spencer, John
Morley. Edward Calrd. George Meredith,
Frederick Harrison and CO.f'OO of the best
men In England signed a ringing protest
against the war? Do you know that the
congregation of the most popular preacher
In London hooted him the other day because
he tried to Justify this conflict? Have you
heard from "Good old Ireland and how doeÂ»
.loaquin Miller made a stirring address,
concluding with a recitation of a poem to
the Boers. Albert Curlin, Stephen Nye
and Judge M. Cooney of San Fra/iclsco
made short addresses, and resolutions
were adoptr-d extending the warmest sym
pathy of the citizens of Oakland to the
Boers, condemning the Government of
Grrat Britain, the hereditary foe of lib
erty and the oppressor of small nations,
and repudiating the assertions of friend
ship for England made by pretended rep
resentatives of this free republic. In con
clusion the resolutions declare that the
South African republics are but uphold
ing the truest principles of lofty patriot
ism of this country, which claims for it
self "the right in its own territory, in Its
own time nnd in its own way to work
out its own destiny, free from all inter
ference from alien races."
SWALLOWS CARBOLIC ACID.
Louise Bernero Quarrels With Her
Husband and Commits Suicide.
I,ou!se Bernero, a young married
woman, swallowed the contents of a bot
tle of carbolic acid yesterday afternoon
at her home, 7 Chambers place, a small
street off Lombard street, between Powell
and Mason, and died in a few minutes in
great agony.
According to the reports of the neigh
bors. Mrs. Bernero had frequent quar
rels with her husband, who is a saloon
keep at 19 Hlnckley alley, and yesterday
at lunch the husband left the house after
a loud and angry discussion with his
wife. Immediately after Bernero left the
house the woman put on her hat and went
to the drug store at Stockton and Union
streets, and under the pretext of using
it for a wash, purchased a bottle of the
acid.
During her absence Mrs. Bernero's
aunt called at the house nnd the young
woman on her return finding her there
walked to the porch and swallowed the
deadly drug. The aunt noticing her
niece's peculiar actions, asked for an ex
planation but received an evasive answer,
and when she saw the young woman stag
gering sent for Dr. Baeigalupi, who was
soon on hand, but too late to bo of ser
vice, as Mrs. Bernero died soon after his
arrival. Deceased was a handsome
woman. 22 yenrs old. She had been mar
ried two years and leaves a child 9
months old.

stroyed and sacked it and finally set lire
to an adjoining store and partially de
stroyed the building belonging to the pe
titioner and the contents thereof, consist-
Ing of a lot of tailor's supplies.

with equal cowardice. Forsythe, the own

VAUDEVILLE MANAGERS
FORM BIG COMBINATION
Nearly Every Prominent House in
This Country Bepresented in
the Association.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â The methods of the
theatrical syndicate have been closely
copied in the formation of a vaudeville
combine, the details of which were con
summated in Chicago to-day at a meeting
of leading managers. * -'. - .
The conference which resulted In ihe
formation of the syndicate, which Is ad
mitted to be the largest In the United
States, was attended by the following:
Michael Shea, Toronto and Buffalo; M. C.
Anderson, Columbia Theater, Cincinnati;
Drew and Campbell, Star Theater, Cleve
land; George Middleton, Columbia Thea
ter, St. Louis; Ed Mcyerfeld and Fred
Beck, Orpheum circuit, including Omaha,
Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco and
Los Angeles; Colonel John D. Hopkins,
Chicago, Nashville, Memphis, New Or
leans and St. Louis; Kohl and Castle,
Michael Shea, Charles B. Kohl and Ed
Meyerfeld were chosen directors, with
full power to act. As the combine now
stands It will be possible to book attrac
tions straight for a season of twenty-five
weeks and this time may be extended to
the entire season should the magnates
conclude to double on drawing attrac
tions. Cincinnati is the. only city In
which the syndicate will find opposition,
the management of the Fountain Theater
In that city not being connected with the
combine. It is the purpose to form a
co-operative agency in Chicago and an
other in New York. The former will be
managed by the Western Vaudeville
Agency, which has been in existence for
for some time past, and the New York
agency will be established as soon as pos
sible. John D. Hopkins explained that
the combine had been formed for the gen
eral good of managers and performers.
Salaries of the latter will not be reduced
by the syndicate. Â¦â¢ ';

FIREMAN'S FUND
INSURANCE COMPANY
Resignation cf President D. J.
Staples and Other Changes.
Recent Important changes in the ad
ministrational affairs of the Fireman's
Fund Insurance Company, at 401-407 Cali
fornia street, are worthy of notice.
Hon. D. J. Staples, who was the efficient
president of the company for a third of
a century, resigned that position this
month owing to increasing years and the
press of private responsibilities. He was
succeeded by William J. Dutton.who was
a&sociated with Mr. Staples for many
years. â¢ Bernard Faymonville, the able
and efficient secretary, was advanced to
the position of vice-president. Â¦
J. B. .Levison was elected second vice
president and marine secretary, which
latter position was held by him for many
years. By reason of these advancements
Louis Weinmann became secretary of
the company. F. W. Lougee, who is well
known in linancial circles, was re-elected
as. treasurer. Stephen D. Ives was also
re-elected as general agent.
The Fireman's Fund Insurance Com
pany is one of the most powerful assur
ance corporations in the country and is
the largest ever organized west of New
York. It is one of a comparatively few
assurance corporations which do the
largest business In the world.
While the advancement of the company
under the past- administration was re
garded as phenomenal, it is the general
opinion that with the new oincers in
charge its affairs will make even more
rapid and substantial strides in the fu
ture.
The company was organized in 1563. Its
officers are all Western men and its in
vestments are in Western enterprises, the
securities being in every respect gilt
edged. The policy of the company is to
keep its funds at home, so that to-day its
assets include many of the best invest
ments known to tho local world of
finance. Its assets aggregate nearly
$4,000,000 and the paid up capital is $1,000,
000.
The directory of the company embraces
several of the best known and responsible
men of California.
SAYS HER HUSBAND'S
CHARGES ARE FALSE
MRS. HARRIET KELLER DEITIES
SHE IS EXTRAVAGANT.
James B. Feehan, referee appointed by
the court to take the testimony in the
action for divorce instituted by Harriet
J. Keller against Herman A. Keller, the
well known mining expert, returned the
written evidence to the court yesterday.
Mrs. Keller seeks for a divorce on the
ground of desertion. She married her
husband in Denver, Colo., October 22, ISS3,
and was deserted by him, she alleges, in
October of IMS. She claims that Keller
is in receipt of a monthly income from a
London syndicate of 51000. Hence she
prays that in addition to a decree of di
vorce the court grant her alimony in the
sum of 1150 a month.
Mr. Keller is at present in South Africa,
but an answer to the complaint was tiled
by his attorneys yesterday. In his answer
he says that he receives an income of but
$4500 a year, and that this is largely ex
pended in his travels through Africa, Aus
tralia and South America in search cf
mines. He says that his wife's extrava
gance caused him to leave her and made
living with her impossible.
In her deposition taken by Referee Fee
han she says that she received a letter
from her husband written in Port Said
Egypt, in which he told her that as they
had no tastes in common he had con
cluded not to live with her any longer
She further testified that while they were
in this city they lived at the Hotel Pleas
anton and were very happy. Her hus
band's desertion caused her great worry
and mental distress, and his constant
charges of extravagance were based on
his own Ideas of the meaning of the term
Emily Helen Richardson, who resides at
1346 Hyde street, corroborated the testi
mony given by Mrs. Keller, and the case
was submitted to Judge Dougherty sit
ting in Judge Dalngerfleld's department of
the Superior Court, for decision.
DENIED A FRANCHISE.
Street Committee Turns Down Bay
and Coast Railway.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday morning and
voted to recommend that the franchise
asked for by the Bay and Coast Railway
be denied. A protest signed by the Real
Estate and Development Company against
the granting of the franchise was placed
on file. The protestants claimed that such
a railway would materially damage the
property in the vicinity of the proposed
franchise and that the plan is not feasi
ble for the reason that it is impossible to
construct and operate a standard gauge
track within the narrow limits of the
street without encroaching on private
property, and sufficient radius cannot bo
given to the curves of the track in turn
ing from one street at right angles into
another street. It was further claimed
that such a railway would be a serious
menace to life and property, as the pro
posed route would occupy streets In the
Potrero district which are now and in the
future destined to be the natural arteries
of large volumes of travel.
The reasons set forth by the protestants
convinced the committee and the vote
against granting the franchise was unan
imous. Supervisors Maguire, Curtis and
Connor all voting no.
The protest against the Southern Paci
fic Railway Company's tracks in the Mis
sion district was considered, but after
some discussion action was postponed for
two weeks to enable people to be heard In
opposition. Similar action was taken with
a protest of the West of Castro-street Im
provement Club against the alleged nui
sance maintained by Gray Brothers in
their rock crushing plant at Clipper and
Twenty-fourth streets.

John Manor. y of Mahony Bros., con

ager of the California Hotel, will leave
lor the East this morning for the pur
pose of Inspecting the principal modern
hostelries of the Eastern cities. They are
being sent by the Fred Crocker estate,
anc the object of the trip is to gather
Information and ideas to be used in con
nection with the proposed Hotel Crocker
to be built at the corner of Van Ness
avenue and Sutler street. It is calculated
to combine the most valuable features of
the Eastern hotels in the plans for the
Hotel Orocker, with the intention of mak
ing 1t one of the finest and most com
plete buildings of the kind on the conti
nent.
The hotel will be constructed by Ma
hony Bros, from plans drawn by Faville
& Bliss. General Warfield is to be the
lessee. It is calculated that the hotel will
cost at least $I.j<W.(AW. and it will take
about two years to complete it. It will
be a building of eleven stories and will
be constructed of brick, iron, stone and
steel. It will be as nearly fireproof as
modern architectural science can make it.
Even the woodwork Is to be mechanically
treated and tested to make it proof
against the element.
It is the purpose of the managers of
the Crocker estate to make the structure
not only an ornament to the city but a
monument to the late Colonel Fred
Crocker. Messrs. Mafcony, Kaville and
Warfltid will remain in the East for sev
eral months on their tour of inspection.
Ground will be broken and worn com
menced aa soon as the plans are com
pleted.

WHILE workmen were engaged in razing the ruins of
the old Bush-street Theater shortly after noon yes
terday, a heavy truss on which two men were work
ing suddenly snapped and precipitated the unfortu
nate laborers. Edwin Woodriff and Joseph Augustine, to
the ground, a distance of thirty feet.
Woodriff and Augustine were sent to work on one of
the two heavy beams directly over the stage of the old
playhouse to clear away the lighter work surrounding it.
They had almost completed their work when the heavy
timber broke in the middle and fell with a crash into the
pile of old lumber and debris in the back of the lot.
So suddenly had the charred timber broken apart that
no word of warning could be given to the men by their
comrades below, and almost before their horror-stricken
fellow laborers realized what had happened the unfortu
nate victims were thrown to the ground and covered with
flying debris.

Charles H. Smith, cashier of the South
ern Pacific Company, filed suit yesterday
for a divorce from his wife, Josephine
Smith, on the ground of cruelty.
In his complaint Mr. Smith alleges that
the cruelty Intllcted upon him by his wife
was both mental and physical, and that
for the past seven years he has been
forced to live apart from her. Not many
years after their marriage, which took
place May 4, 1878, he says his wife began
to accuse him of unfaithfulness and
charged him with neglecting her for other
women. Finally she charged him with
every crime known to the code, accused
him of stealing from the Southern Pacific
Company and did her utmost to wreck his
happiness and life. When they were liv
ing in the Grand Hotel Mr. Smith charges
that his wife would wait until he was
asleep and then strike him in the f*>ce
and call him "dog" and "cur." Again he
'accuses her of forcing his son to assault
him and horsewhip him without cause or
provocation. She also blackened his eyes,
he alleges, and at a later date, at a social
gathering, vented her hatred by throwing
a glass of wine in his face. For these and
other specified reasons he asks that a de
cree of divorce be granted him on the
ground of cruelty.
In 1893 Mrs. Smith sued her husband for
maintenance and the court allowed her
$1(0 a month. Mr. Smith asks that this
amount be reduced to $30 a month, which
he says is sufficient for her support and
needs.

Morris Einstein, proprietor of the Com
mercial Milling Company, died of heait
disease about 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon while sitting in a chair in his of
fice. 119 Bluxome street. He had been in
good health for some time past, and com
plained of feeling 111 only a few minutes
before he expired.
Mr. Einstein was a native of Bavaria,
aged 71 years, and came to this country
in the eariy '50'b. settling at Gllroy i; c
finally removed to this city and amassed
considerable wealth. Owing to the illnens
of Ills brother Jacob he recently assumed
control of the interests of the J. Einstein
Milling Company and consolidated it with
his own ' -mpany. He was well known as
a promii.ciit member of the Produce Fx
change.
Â¦Mr, Einstein lived with his family at
2321 Sacramento street, and was taken
there instead of to the Morgue as Dr
Herzstein, the family physician, an
nounced that he would sign the death cer
tificate and assign the cause of death aa
: heart disease. â¢
Their escape from Instant death was little short of
miraculous. Had the heavy beams fallen flat on the mass
of debris the men surely would have been crushed to
death. It is only due to the fact that the beams found solid
lodgment against the adjoining building that the men owe
their lives.
As soon as the dust had cleared away Woodriff and
Augustine were taken from the ruins and sent to the City
Receiving Hospital in an ambulance which had been hur
riedly summoned. Examinations showed that Woodriff
had sustained a fracture of the left leg above the ankle,
and had probably received internal - injuries. Augustine's
condition was more serious, he having received a lacerated
scalp and a probable fracture of the skull. In addition to
a badly sprained back and some internal Injuries. Augus
tine since his arrival at the hospital has been suffering In
tense pain, and the doctors think his recovery is doubtful.
Woodriff, they say. will pull through.

During the extra session headquarters

eble to poim to a vaFt hea l' of undi!!trll> 
uted executive patronage for bestowal on
Mexican sympathizers. The members
will be wholly indifferent as to the Gov

The only punishment that can be vis

of the Mexican is the enmity of the
Southern Pacific corporation.
The indications are that C. P. Hunt
lnston will not permit Herrin to inflict
much punishment on this score, as Burns
Is in the field to vindicate the political
Judgment of the law department, rather
than to extend the business operations of
the road. All the signs, therefore, point
to the compact organization of forty
three or more of the fifty-five independ
ent Republicans who balked Herrin and
Burns at the regular session. The mere
suggestion of such organization throws
the supporters of Burns into frantic rage.
A leader in the Burns corral says: "We
will smash the caucus scheme if any plan
Is carried out to settle the Senatorship
in a conference from which the minority
Fhail be excluded." Despite such threats
to smash the caucus the elements oppos

It is no longer a secret that Herrin and
Burns, having a premonition of such con
templated plan of organisation, hastened
the call for the extra session. Senator
Cutter's agreement surprised the cattle
in the corral.
In order to break the force of The Call's

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 26, 1900.
HEATHEN WAR
IN CHINATOWN
DECLARED OFF
Hostile Tongs Declare
for Peace.
GEE GUM TONG AS MEDIATOR
MERCHANTS WIIiL REIMBURSE
VICTIMS' FAMILIES.
Acting Chief of Police Still Demands
Information and Promises
From Highbinders Before
He Will Recall Officers.
The warring tongs in Chinatown have
at last laid down their arms and. agreed
to bring the hostilities to a close. The
treaty of peace, which Is expected to ac
complish the cessation of hostilities, was
presented last night to representatives of
the Suey Sing Tong and the Hop Sing
Tong, and agreed to by each party. While
it has not yet been signed by the presi
dents of the belligerent factions, yet their
representatives have pledged themselves
that the compact will go into effect im
mediately.
The Gee Gum Tong, one of the most an.
dent Chinese Masonic societies and per
haps the strongest in Chinatown, was di
rectly instrumental in bringing about a
pacinc condition of affairs. The tong has
been called upon many times before to
exert its influence in arbitrating tong dif
ferences, and has generally been success.
ful. In the present instance the Gee Gum
Tong was prevailed upon by the Six Chi
nese Companies, the Merchants' Associa
tion and the Consul General to attempt
to restore peace in San Francisco. They
undertook the task about one week ago,
but up to yesterday the prospects wers
most discouraging.
Obstacles were encountered at every
turn, but the peacemakers remained de
termined In their purpose. The Suey
Sing Tong signed an agreement of peace a
few days ago and It was later submitted
to Wong Shi Shu. who was then In the
neighborhood of Marysville, for his appro
bation. The president of the Hop Sing
Tong refused to sign and stated that his
organization would not drop its hatchet
until it had secured satisfaction for the
lives that had been sacrificed by it 3
rivals. Other hitches occurred and the
messenger returned with his mission un
fulfilled!
Acting Chief Blggy then announced his
Intention of bringing 'Chinatown more
closely under the ban of police rule. He
made decisive threats as to restrictions in
conduct during the New Year festivities,
and this obliged those who were acting in
the Interest of peace for the sake of
Chinese trade, to increase their efforts.
Asa result the representatives of the fight
ing highbinders were forced into a settle
ment last night and agreed that spite
and crime should be forgotten.
The terms of the agreement are singu
lar Inasmuch as no indemnity is asked by
either tong for the men that have been
slaughtered. It Is mutually understood,
however, that the families of the un
fortunate men shall not suffer or want,
and to this end the merchants will take
up a subscription to pay each family be
tween $150 and $200. The Hop Sing Tong
made the statement that only <Â»ie active
member of its tong had fallen a victim to
the assassins' bullets. This man they
claimed was a carpenter. Wong Yuen,
who was killed on Waverly place.
The question of paying indemnity for
each of the victims by the tongs at whose
hands they lost their lives was settled
by Consul General Ho Vow, who would
not permit any such transaction. He
stated that if any money was accepted in
exchange for the taking of life the tongs
would be obliged to hinder any movement
of the law toward the prosecution of the
murderers should they be apprehended.
The popular subscription for the relief of
the victims' families was his suggestion
and a clause was inserted In the procla
mation providing that the law shall be
permitted to take its course if the per
petrators of crime are discovered.
Wong Shi Shu is now at the Old Oak
mills, about fifteen miles from Calistoga,
and the president of the Suey Sins Tung
is in San Francisco. The former will
come to this city at once and when the
two meet they will append their signa
tures to the document of peace, which will
be placed on file. To-day acting Chief of
Police Blggy will be present at a meeting
of the Six Companies, at which the re
wards for the apprehension of the tong
leaders will be revoked. The extra re
wards for the apprehension of the mur
derers will also cease to exist.
Many Chinese who have been in hiding
for some weeks past appeared on the
streets last night and Chinatown donned
a holiday appearance. The notices of the
determination of the tongs to bury their
hatchets will be posted In the prominent
streets this morning-.
CHINESE GAMBLERS' SCHEME.
Four leading Chinese gambling-house
keepers have agreed to test the authority
of the police in stopping their games as
soon as a Chief of Police shall be named
by the Police Commissioners. The names
of the gamblers are Won" Fook. Chan
Chung, Goose Neck and Buck Eye. AH
have retained attorneys and will make
their fight on the ground that they are
operating under charters issued by the
Legislature for the conducting of "liter
ary and social" clubs.
For the past two weeks Acting Chief
Biggy has obliged all the Chinese clubs
to keep their doors open and their busi
ness has been practically ruined. The
leading gamblers have now agreed to
combine in an effort to prevent the police
from any further interference of this
character.
Wong Fook has been elected to open his
gambling-house and run it in defiance of
law, cr he will get an injunction in one
of the courts preventing the police from
entering upon the premises of his rooms
In order to make a test case.
