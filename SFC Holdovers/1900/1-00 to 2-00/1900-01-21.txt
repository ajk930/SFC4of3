HAPPILY for the present writer the text to this
thesis is confronting him only as a theory and
not a condition. He has a wife and he has a
tome, but the two are inseparable, and, so far. for hi-n
personally this crisis has only been crisising in her di
rection.
Having had absolutely no experience in this regard,
except as the provider of the temporary vacant chair
n..>.c.r, I z-:v perhaps'all the more prepaid to Rive se^v
eral splendid solutions of the problem â each solution
better than the other.
It would be idle to digress to the extent of even
hinting that it would be no task to be happy during
the first or hundredth visit away from home of some
wives. And it would also be idle to say that I could
be the least b:t happy, even for the sake of argument.
dv:.:-.!; any absence away frora home' of the lady who
docs me the honor of wearing my name and spending
the money I earn.
Vv to the hour of going to press this dear little
woman has shown wonderful endurance. She has not
left our happy home even temporarily: she has not in
timated any such intention. This may be love or it
mays be resignation, but. come to think of it. it may be
deficiency of wardrobe. Yes, I remember now some
hints to this last effect. .
Thus, having no personal experience to draw upon,
I must imagine myself to bereft, deserted and alone.
and striving, sad heart, to be merry withal.
How th;.'l I be happy while my wife's away?
There is but one answer (I said I could give several,
bv.t it was a bluff). The answer is occupation.
I once knew a man who. fortunately, was kept under
rontrol. who confided to me that his one ambition in
life, the one great happiness he looked forward to. hope
ful, expectant, longing, was to go to New York sonic
right â he lived in Jersey on installments â and get in
toxicated and ride around the brilliantly lighted thor
oughfares of the great metropolis with his feet over the
dashboard of the craft and him crying "Whoopee!"
every time the autov.hatyoumaycallit turned a corner.
But he has a wife of great force of character and
â¢trcngth of mind and arm. She keeps him well in han-I
Â«nd will rot pamper him to the extent* of even permit
ting him to carry his luncheon into New York in a
dress suit case, as his more partially treated commuter
friends do.
If that man ever gets the opportunity; if his wife
ever goes away, I know he will meet the crisis with
Dutch courage, an electric cab and the "Whoopees!" he
has promised himself, and I will be sent for at some
unholy hor.r to bail him out.
To all of you who have such wicked thoughts and
plans as these (but no properly trained husband will
have them. I am sure), let n:e tell you of way^ far bct
trr to assuage the grief you feel during the temporary
ib^T.re of your fporse.
Don't smoke in the parlor under the hypocritical pre
tense that your doing so will keep the moths out of the
lace curtains. Ten to one the curtains arc Nottingham
and tlic moths have better taste.
Don't bring home the three or four friends who are
so fond of pinochec. You have only, the ordinary deck
in the drawer of your card table, and you will not.be
able to refu c c to bank for a little game of table stakes.
Penny ante is your limit. Then, those that lose will
hang you wp and those that win will collect for their
chips on the spot. Anyway, your wife ha^ never <-on
si'!(red these fellows fit company for you. Why nont
you make friends with that perfectly lovely Mr. Mid
ge!!?, who brought home a plaster of paris kneecap
that weighed forty pounds, a souvenir of Dewey, being
a part of ore o? the heroic figures on the Madison
square arch? When he was carrying it away a police
man tried to stop him and he just shook his umbrella at
the fellow. There's the kind of a man you ought to
know!
Jut failing in securing the companionship of Mr.
Micigette. there still remains the lethe of occupation.
"But," yo-.i say, "what shall I do? My work at my
store or office is exacting, and when I come home I do
not want to bring my business cares with me." '
True, indeed, say I! But there are occupations" at
once soothing and improving. Some light and cheerful
work to keep the mind engaged and the heart happy
when your helpmeet is away. To tell you what these
â¢ire and how to go about them is the purpose of this
essay.
Suppose you have a savage canary. Why not put in j
Crocheting is another pleasant occupation. In e*sÂ«
you find golf too sedentary. Several dozen doyliej fin
ished by your hands will be a cheering task that will
give you pleasure and make the time of your wife'i ab
sence seem short indeed. Here are the directions hovr
to knit a dainty hemstitched "fascinator":
Knit four â purl â drop two â knit eight â overcast â
purl two â knit not â purl â drop four â foozle â drop the
whole blooming business.
In case you find you are not strong enough to do
crocheting, you may take up some lighter form of fancy
work, such as, say, the making of castiron statuary for
suburban la.vns. Do not let any of your friends dis
suade you from this by their sneering. "It's pretty, but it
isn't art!" Some of the very wealthiest people I know
have their lawns fairly covered with castiron statuary â
dog?, deer and moral mythological subjects.
A castiron dog is the best to begin on. Always
try everything on the dog is the first law of many
enterprises. Choose your model from life; your neigh
bor's dog will do. Put him in a barrel and your ready
mixed plaster of parts over him. In som; cases this re
sults in a model not exactly from life, but, after all. it's
your neighbor's dog. Having prepared your mold,
gather all the scrapiron you can find and melt it over
a slow fire. Do not be impatient, and at the same time
be careful it docs not jell before you are ready. Let it
gently shnmer and stir briskly all the time. From time
io tir.ie drop a little in a glass, of water; when you see
it hardens just right, grease your mold, pour in and
set aside to cool. The result v.r'l be astonishing.
In ca?e you desire to make a little pin money during
your wife's absence, for often a wife finds it hard xo
spare even the best of husbands mucli more than car
fare, you could sell the results of your crochetinsr or
the output of your home-made castiron statuary works
to some of your well-to-do married friends. But in case
you find it hard to dispose of your handiwork you mignt
the time while your wife is away in breaking its spirit
in taming its ferocious nature? Your pleasure will be
in anticipating the joy your wife will evince when Â«she
finds upon her return that the canary is cured of its
dangerous bursts of rage and sullen fits of temper. That
it will cat out of her hand, nor growl over its. food. -That
it will not bark at nigln J to disturb the neighbors again,
nor have to be, muzzled this summer as last. ' '-
To train a savage canary is the simplest affair when
one knows how. In the first place it must not be fed on
meat. A plain, substantial vegetarian diet, with fruit, is
the first 'step. The next is firmness. Let the canary see
that you will not be trifled with; that while your wife
is away you are the master of the house. If necessary
punish. Take it out daily for exercise.

MIDWINTER FASHIONS
IN SILK SHIRT
WAISTS
JT^ACH season some one in the realm of fashion, some one who
fl, loves long unbroken lines and zvhose artistic bump is jarred
by the hybrid combination â a waist of one color and a skirt
of another â declares that the reign of the shirt waist is over, that
it has seen its best day and is a thing of the past. But it is not
so. Separate waists are here and are here to stay. A woman can
make too creditable a showing with one skirt and four or five odd
waists ever to give them. up. They appeal to the economical side of
the pocketbook and to solid comfort too strongly ever to lose their
dominion over feminine hearts.
Materials for the separate waists vary. Persian velvet and
the new soft satin are very popular, crepe de chine, taffeta, mous
seline de soie, liberty silk and rare lace are used and are combined
zvith every imaginable trimming. Bands of velvet, frillings, shir
rings, tuckings and mousselinc de soie play an important part in the
making of the bodice. The tucked bodices are very much worn.
A pretty one can be fashioned of crepe de chine, tucked- from belt
to throat in horizontal tucks, the tucks decreasing in size as they
reach the waist line. Black stock and belt zvith jet or a soft collar
of chiffon complete this< simple waist.
This is a spangle season. Sequins, jets, steel and silver glis
ten on the bodices and at night shine like diamonds and are exceed
ingly becoming. She zuho has gypsy blood in her veins and loves
the glitter of gold and silver may spangle her zvaists to her heart's
content. White taffeta zvith silver trimming on lace is very dainty.
The boleros of applique with steel or silver and collar and belt to
match make a bodice of simple cut most attractive. - Gold braid,
black velvet and gold sequins finished zvith a collar and belt of
gold and jet make a beautiful theater waist and one to delight the
heart of its wearer. *
About the skirts to be worn zvith these separate waists. Every
woman knows that it is poor economy to wear the skirt of a gown
in this way, as the zvaist is usually nczv when the skirt is quite
worn out. It is sometimes a "puzzle to knozv just what material to
get for a separate skirt. For- any and every occasion the skirt of
black satin, velvet or silk is suitable, zvith the preference for silk
as it wears better. The plainer the skirt, that is the straighter . the
lines, the better. A much-trimmed skirt is exceedingly poor taste
as well as poor economy. For home wear or half evening dress a
white satin skirt is {very pretty and stylish. It demands for its
waist one of a pale light color and made of light, fluffy materials.
These skirts are not as extravagant as one would think. White
satin is not so expensive and it stays clean as long as any other
white .material and is much easier to clean.
Blue is perhaps the color of the moment. Not the cold pearl
blue, but the warm sunset blue which is quite yellowish, and the mir
ror blue which shows so many. colors.
Sapphire blue is very popular and its trimming is steel. The
combination of blue and steel gives a silvery effect which is par
ticularly pretty at night. Silver, steel and jet paillettes glisten on
the gowns as well- as, on the zvaists.yOV 3 ING is the woman at the bottom of it. "It," in this
case, is the highbinder war.
One little sixteen-year-old Chinese girl zvas of enough
importance to be brought all the way from Hongkong to .Marys
ville; to be sold into slavery for much clinking gold; to be rescued
by a white girl at the risk of life; to be hunted dozen in our city
by hundreds of scheming men, and finally to be smuggled on board
a steamcr^and sent, home over pounding winter seas. Her story is
told here by the girl who rescued her.
*T ERE in the heart of darkness yel-
I \ low men are skulking and spying
I I and hating and killing. Some
J^ I walk abroad bearing with them
+S the knowledge that they are
marked for death, -_id some go
forth unsuspecting to meet it, all because
of poor, little, helpless Jou Sing. She
was only 1G years old when she was coax
ed from her dull life in an outlying village
of Hongkong. It was a stupid world that
Burrounded her thereâ a world all rice
flelds and little houses, and it was pad
ale, paddle about the fields all day long.
with never an end to work. So when a
man came and said that he had heard
of Jou Sing's prettiness, and that she was
the very wife he wanted for a friend of
his in America, Jou Sing listened.
That was four years agoâ four years
since Jou Sing said "good-by" to her
mother. The mother had looked upon the
whole matter from a practical standpoint,
and so after she called a last word to
Jou Sing she went back to the house, put
the stew over the fire to cook and gave
It a five minutes' stirring. But at the
end of the five minutes she dropped her
china spoon and ran out upon the glit
tering white road again and stood with
her long, lean hand shading narrowed
eyes. When she returned the stew was
burning.
Once In San Francisco. Jou Sing was
turned over to the "husband." She Â» was
never happy in his home. She had gone
through a form of marriage meant to
quiet her growing doubts, but the pleas
ures of San Francisco life were not what
ehe had fancied. All day she was
kept in the little upstairs room,
where fresh air and sunshine tried now
and then to sneak In, but always failed.
Sometimes a rat would poke his nose
over the door board, and she was afraid
of rats. They were not afraid of her and
they grew more numerous and more im
pudent, for Ho Kee. a neighbor, was al
ways spilling crumb 3 of his rice cake on
the stairs, as if to invite the rats In.
At last Jou Sing grew too unhappy to
hide her feelings. The man might be
wealthy, but what of that if she had no
advantage of his wealth? Once he had
taken her to the park on a Sunday after
noon, and then she fancied that her
dream of gayety was coming true, but he
never took her again. She became rebel
lious and begged, then demanded that
Â¦he be taken back to her home, which was
no duller than the American city, and
harbored no rats in its household.
One night she heard the man and a
friend talking in the hall.
"It will not do to keep her here." said
one. "She becomes restless and in time
her feeling will be discovered."
"She had better be sent away."
"Where?"
"To Marysville."
Less than a year after the time of land-
Ing in our port Jou Sing was taken to the
Chinatown in Marysville.
As a result of her unhappy life there,
trouble arose. She took no pains to con
ceal her misery, and her owner took no
pains to lessen it, for the Chinatown of
Marysville is a long way from any mis
sions, and therefore safeâ or supposed to
be so. But the owner was mistaken in
this one case.
A Chinaman who was interested in the
mission work came to know Jou Sing and
her trouble. Finally he decided that he
would take the risk of helping her to
â¢scape.
He sent me word of the case. He asked
me if I would undertake the rescue of
Jou Sing provided he made all arrange
ments. I realized thai it would be dlifi
cult and dangerous at such a distance
from the home, but I could not refuse.
So I said "Yes."
He told the girl all about :ne and my
promise to save her. Together they laid
plans.,. She was to be ready on a certain
night' in December, when I would come to
the house. She would know me as the
white lady who would come to her door
and say, "Jou Sing!"
All this time I had taken it for granted
that the man would accompany me, oth
erwise I don't know whether I should ever
have had the courage to make my at
tempt. I bought my ticket and arranged
to leave in the afternoon. At the eleventh
hour he appeared and told me that I must
go alone.
"Why?" I asked.
"Because I have receiv-ed word from
friends that I am suspected and my life
would not be a day longer if I should
go with you to Marysville."
''But I can't go without you. I don't
know the house or the girl."
"You must go. She is expecting you to
night, and delay will mean failure. There
Is danger of our plans being discovered,
, and by another day poor Jou Sing may
: be spirited away." .
j ~I saw that there was no way out of Itâ
: I must go.
I "Tell me how to find her," I said.
So he diew a diagram of the house Rnd
gave me a careful description. On tha
main street of Chinatown I was to walk
to a large one-story house on the left side
âa house with a deep garden In front
and a wall about the garden. The,dia
gram showed the entrance of the house,
the ball and the room where Jou Sing
would be found.
Chief Lees gave me a letter of Introduc
tion to Mr. Maben, the marshal there.
After much trouble I found himâremem
ber that It was S o'clock at night and I
"was alone in a strange town. Mr. Maben
"was as kind as a man could be and stool
by me through all the struggles of that
terrible night.
In the first place, he told me that the
rescue ought not to, be attempted then,
for there was a shooting fray going on
among the Chinese and the quarter waa
already In a state of excitement. But I
was growing more fiercely determined Ht
every discouragement, nnd nothing would
turn me back. So T>lr. Maben and a lieu
tenant started out with me.
I had already engaged a room in this
hotel where I <-ould take Jou Sing, but I
couldn't help having my doubts about her
ever reaching it.
When we came to her owner's house
I knew it at once "from the description.
I led the way and the- officers followed
close behind.
I had a clear mental diagram of the
house plan. I entered without hesitation
and walked directly down the length of
the hall and opened the last door on the
right. A girl was sitting in the room,
surrounded by a' crowd of the. roughest
looking Chinamen I have ever seen! They
were loafing and smoking.' The owner^was
away.-' " : Â¦ â¢ ' . -. Â¦''-' : ';Â¦â¢.' Â¦.'.: ' ,'
"Jou Sins'-" I said. . .;â¢ v". ,Â»'
The gtrl sprang lip* and rushed ipi me,
screaniing. ShY clutched myhanii/and
dragged me out of, the house. The offi
cers hurried along. with us and we es
caped without hindrance from the group
of dazed men. The real difficulties were
to come later. ,;
All the way. to the hotel Jou Sing ran
hard, dragging me after her. She cried
constantly that she was afraid of cap
ture and she beat her breast and shrieked
after the manner of Chinese women.
When we reached the room and the
door was locked she sank into a chair and
cried after the manner of all women.
If I had been satisfied all might have
none smoothly. But I did a foolish thing.
It came of my noticing that she was thin
ly clud. She told me by signs that she
had packed her clothes in a box ready
for traveling and had left them In the
room in the excitement of her escape.
Then I made my great mistake. I de
cided to go back for the box.
i Jou Sing v.as left at the hotel, and I
started out. The police advised me not to
try another trip to Chinatown; but 1 was
bent upon having the garments. The poor
girl was shivering for want of them, and
I feared that she might become seriously
ill. So Mr. Maben sent me off with a po
liceman.
H was late by this time and the streets
were deserted. We went straight to the
house and attempted to ener as before.
The door was locked.
The policeman knocked and shouted and
rattled the door, but no sound came Irom
within. At last I peeped through a corner
of the window where the curtain was
pushed aside, and saw a great, heavy
faced, crucl-cycd. Chinaman. We learned
afterward that he was the owner, who
had returned.
Then the policeman threatened, but
there was no response, so the door ha 2
to be broken in.
I went to the door of Jou's room and
found it locked. The owner followed, and
the policeman demanded the key. It was
refused, and thereupon came the dread
ful struggle.
There the three of us were, at the back
of a long hall, out of reach of help. I
stood by while those two men, the little,
wiry white one and the great, savage
yellotv one, fought like animals. At last
the Chinaman drew a revolver.
Then I was truly frightened, not so
much for myself as for the plucky little
officer whom I had brought into all this
trouble. I seized the Chinaman's arm
-and a frightful struggle ensued.
How we did It I don't know, but the
policeman and I managed to drag that
man to the front gate, and there a crowd
of Chinese gathered. The officer was de
termined by this time to arrest the man
and would not let him go; so I held one
of his long, strong armsâ held It with all
my strengthâ while the policeman reached
for his whistle. He blew and blew, but
no help came.
. It was not until I induced two white
girls to run for help tluit the police knew
of our difficulty. While we waited for
them the struggle kept on, and every lit
tle while the mob pressed forward and
threatened us, but, halS afraid, they made
no attack.
Finally help came and the owner of Jou
Sing was sent to jail. We were safe for
the time, but he and his tongs were silent
ly cherishing a. grudge for the arrest that
grew greater for the cherishing.
For about two weeks after Jou Sing
and I reached the Mission Home in San
Francisco all was quiet. Then a China,
man who is a friend of ours sent me a
message, saying that the hostile men
were about to get out a warrant for the
girl's arrest on the ground. of petty lar
ceny.
The next morning our bell rang and 1
went to the door and saw through the
glass a Btrange Chinaman and a San Jose
constable. I knew then that the mes
sage had been true, so I flew upstairs and
bade our Interpreter hide Jou Sing. Then
I returned and ushered in the callers with
all. the- suave surprise I could muster.
For a long time I kept the constable at
bay. He- told me that he had a warrant
to arr**t on* of our fifth >nt a* be did
"It's jio use to put us off any longer.
Miss Cameron," hesaid. "You know and
I know that the girl we" want is here and
I shan't go back to San Jose without
her."
"Then I'll call to the schoolroom every
girl in the building and let this man iden
tify her if he can," I said.
So I rang for the girls and they flocked
in. Tall and short, fat and thin, pretty
and plain, all shaking with excitement.
The Chinaman looked them over and was
a disgusted man when he found no Jou
Sing. "We must "search the house," said
the constable, "We know she is here*
for a Chinaman says he saw her at tha
window this morning."
"Comb hair," said the Chinaman.
It was true enough. Foolish little Jou
had sat at an upstairs window that. very
day having her hair combed and plastered
and stuck full <jf gorgeous ornaments,
for there is a little lurking vanity in her
heart despite her hard life. Men must
have been watching the house all day.
When I found that the house was to ba
searched my only thought was how to get
Jou S?ng away. So, on the pretext of
sending for our lawyer, I induced the
constable to delay a little while, and in
the meantime I went about arranging her
escape. I gave directions to have her
dress in my mackintosh, hat and veil. Sha
was to slip out the side door and nurry
to a Powell street car.
When I thought that everything waÂ«
moving smoothly the interpreter cama to
me. "We can't get out of the side door
unseen." she whispered. "Every tlma we
start the men outside gather around tha
door to watch."
I was in despair. One way finally oo
curred to me; it lay through thÂ« back
shed and by way of the church on the
next street.
So I shouldered an ax and went forth
to chop through the fence. When this
was done we got the girl through, hid her
under the shed and waited.
The house was searched. No room or
closet was left unopened. At last the twe
men went away; the one hissing Chinese
oaths at the whole mission system, the
other swearing in plain Knglish that ha
would never leave for San Jose without
the girl he was after.
As soon as they were gone I made for
the shed where Jou Sing was, and togeth
er we ran for a carriage I had ordered.
"Where?" asked the driver.
"Anywhere," I said; "only drive."
For an hour we drove about town, and
then we went to the home of an American
friend. She kept the girl a few days, and
when we thought all was safe we brought
her back.
On the 2d of January another constable
and another Chinaman came to the horn*
and -the searching was repeated. Dozens
of Chinese were hanging around the house
and calling in through the basement win
dows. * They were open, and most of tha
searching was going on in the- basement,
where our kitchen is. "Look behind that
barrel," one would shout in Chinese; and
another "Turn over that r box." All the
pantries, were turned topsy-turvy and
sticks were poked into the rice
bin and the tea canister was opened
and the pepper sprinkler was shaken, but
no Jou Sing. During all this three of the
little girls clung to me and. watched the
men "in open-mouthed terror, but uttered
no word,. although they knew the hiding
place as well as I; and the. cook went on
calmly stirring apple sauce as if the whole
household were not breathlessly /watch-
Ing the game of "warmer-colder."
The same week little Jou Sing was sent
to China. We smuggled her on board a
eteamer and she is now on her way back
to the stupid old rice fields which; per
haps, won't be so stupid now that she
has learned what the promised paradise
of America is not. I wonder if, when
she plods along the white, glittering: road
from Hongkongâ l wonder will a yellow,
woman stand before a hut with lean hand
shading narrowed eyes while she watches
to see who is the girl plodding village

gleaming in eleven buttonholes. In
J 1 -0 Fhort. eleven blushing brides and
eleven happy grooms, all walking
up the aisle of St. Sulpice, where a sol
itary priest awaited at the al
tarâsuch Is the spectacle that
greeted an astonished saunteror In
Paris one day not long since. He after
ward referred to it as "bargain wedding
day." having gleaned from one of the at
tcr.dantp in the church that the marriages
were performed In this wholesale fashion
to save the expense of Individual cere
monies.
The next time I saw my friend, the
cbhe of St. Eulpice. I took occasion to in
terrogate him about this "marriage en
Â£TOS."
"Is It true that eleven couples were re
cently married at once In the church of Bt.
S'j'.pieo?" I asked him.'
"1 could not say positively about the
number." he answered, "but it Is not at
all improbable. It is nothing extraordin
ary to marry five or six couples in this
fashion, and sometimes there are as many
as twelve or fifteen. You know they ire
all the proteges of the St. Francais Regis
Society. Of course, you have heard >,t
th:^ Fo^iety. You haven't? Well, it 5s one
of the oldest and the mnpt approved char
itles In France, the object being to ar
range marriages for the poor, to pay the
expenses incidental to the ceremony and
even to find suitable husbands and wive^."
"What a queer idea." I exclaimed. "l:i
America to discourage the matrimonial
notion among people who could not afford
to pay tor the'oeremony I am fure would
be considered more worthy of commenda
tion."
"But the poor must marry as well as
the rich," paid the abbe ardently. "Indeed,
this society has not only a deep religious
and moral principle, but a patriotic one
a? well. France must be populated. We
must have citizens and soldiers, an!
whence will they come if not from the
poor? The rich do not by any means con
tribute their share to the population of
the country."
"But does this society contribute In any
way toward the support of the families
whi<-h it Is Instrumental In commencing?"
"I think not." Eaid the abbe. "I thi!:k
Its mission is accomplished when the w^d
fling day Is over. But If you are inter
ested in these particulars you mltrht visit
the office of the society, which is behind

will be glad to tell you all about It."
It was only a stone's throw, Â«=o I ran
Into the office, after saying good-by to
the abbe.
The directress, a portly, good-ratured
looking woman, a little of "la concierge"
type, was assisting a very happy looking
bride to remove her veil and orange b'os
poms. A pair of white gloves, that the
bride had evidently just taken off, was ly
ing on the table by the side of an arti
ficial bouquet. The bridegroom, beaming
in a manner equally contented and perer.e,
tugged at the clasp of a" white kid glove!
into which by some process Inexplicable
he had stuffed a huge fat hand.
"Prenez garde," said the directress.

There was a depth of philosophy In her
remark that I hardly expected from on*
so buxom.
"But how about the additional re
sponsibilities â does your society occupy
Itself at all with the future of these fam
ilies ?"
"No, np\ at all. Our concern ends with
the wedding day. We buy the ring, pay
the priest and all of the municipal ex
pense, loan the wedding clothes where tha
parties desire it and provide the wedding
breakfast. After that our duty ends."
"And how are these marriage* brought
aboutâ do you arrange them, or does each,
groom find hi* own bride?"
"They are brought about In both way*.
When an indigent couple wishes to ba
married they . present themselves and
state their case. Wa also undertake the
task of looking for husbands and wives.
For Instance a poor girl thinks that sh*
wouldillke to be a wife and a mother; wÂ»
consider such a commendable aspiration
and try to find her a suitable husband.
We make a similar effort for young men
looking for wives. You know the society
Is composed of very influential people,
many of them supporting it from patrlotio
motives. The membership Is very largo
and we are nearly always successful ia
finding life companions for those who de
sire them. There la another work often
accomplished by the society which is
perhaps the most commendable of all. It
looks for cases where people are living to
gether Irregularly and persuades them if
possible to be properly married and to
legitimize their children. Such cases
among the poor are very numerous
In Paris, quite often their only ob
jection to a legal union being the exper.sa
connected therewith. Since its estab
lishment in 1526 the society has brought
about more than 75.0C0 marriages and haa
legitimized more than 60,ft00 children."
There was a stir In the corner and tha
bride and groom reappeared shorn of all
their finery. She. hattess and glovejess in,
a dingy, thin looking dress that made mÂ«
shiver when I thought of the coll out
side;'he, in a greasy threadbare coat to
which he had transplanted a white chrys

outfit. The bride's artificial bouquet was
the property of the society and had to be
left behind with the wreath and veil and
the orange blossomj. Poor little bride!
Not even a violet to pin upon her faded
little gown. I felt like taking the chrys
anthemum and giving her the half of It.
for why shouldn't she begin this new ex

as he? But my Justice, I doubt not,
would have been more Solomonio than

"Cest tres Joie. nest cc pas ?' the groora

the chrysanthemum and explaining that
It was the gift of his wife. "Oui. I bought
it for quatre sous," said the bride, as If
apologizing for her extravagance.
She had bought the chrysanthemum

have begged or stolen a flower for her.

A CROCODILE HUNT
By Professor Charles f. Jiolder.
Author of "Tbe Ivory King." "Marvels of Aniroal Life." Etc
IT If not generally known that we have
In this country a crocodile." said
a cocoanut planter of the Blscayne
country. "I lived In Florida, near the
Miami, for months before I knew it.
f met the Seminoles from up the swamp
?very now and then, and when I asked
'or game they always referred to what
hey called the 'sharp-nosed 'gator/
vhlch, I supposed, was the common alli
rator. One day, however, I came across
in Indian who had the skull of one of
hese fharp-nosed 'gators for sale. I
nought It ar.d was at once struck with the
Mfferer.ce between it and that of the alll
rator. One was pointed, with sharp teeth;
he other flat and round-nosed, with blunt,
-rushJr.g teeth. Here, unsuspectedâ at
east by the majority of white people, I
Jiscovered â was as perfect a crocodile
is could be found on the Nile, and I de
.ermlned to capture one If possible.
"Alligators were fairly common and It
vas difficult to distinguish them from the
rrocodiles; but I learned that the croc
odiles were found near the mouths of
<t reams, in salt water, and that the alli
gators were more at home upstream,
this time a party of friends from
*Cew York came down to my plantation,
0 we organized a hunt and for several
iays ecoured the little bays and Inclosed
irt as of the coast; went up the rivers and
rawled into the swamps, but never saw
1 large crocodile. We were, in fact,
luntlnr for a giant described by the In
lians.as twenty or twenty-one feet long
hat had been Bt-en and shot at a score of
Imw. but no one had ever bit it. It was
eported as taking to the rivers In win-
- .-â¢ t
ter and being- fcph way up In the swamp,
poing down to salt water. In Mimmer.
"This monster was fully pictured In our
imaginations. We could see his big head,
his enormous mouth, the corrugated back
in every submerged log or alligator. But
days flipped by and he failed to material
ize. One day I took the party out on to
the reef a mile from shore to spear turtle
or any game that might come along, and
the main subject of our conversation was
our poor luck with crocodiles. While
we were talking my man suddenly
stopped rowing and pointed to the reef.
As I turned In that direction a long tail
was lifted out of the water, coming down
with a powerful splash; and then a lor.g,
allijrator-like body became visible and im
mediately disappeared, causing a "mall
wake to follow as It moved away.
' " 'Crocodile.' said the man.
" 'What? Out here? Nonsense, man: 1 ex
claimed one of my companions.
â¢' 'You saw it, sir?' said the man. turn-
Ing to me. 'No shark rould look like that.
It was either a crocodile or an alligator,
and I never heard of an alligator coming
out to sea,'
"It was an easy question to settle and
the boat was turned In the direction of
the animal, the man in the bow taking
out the harpoonâ a three-pronged affairâ
and examining it to see if the rope was
attached. The boat was rowed slowly,
the men making as little noise as possible,
the location of the animal now being In
dicated by a swirl of water not seventy
f*-el away. Whatever It was. It was evi
dently feeding in the shallow water. Not
a word was said as the boat slowly drifted
up; the harpooncr stood erect and ready,
when suddenly, fifteen feet from the boat,
up came the broad, corrugated back of a
huge crocodile, and the next moment a
sharp-pointed muzzle protruded from the
water, having in its jaws a ray, which
it tossed from side to side, endeavoring to
tear the wide body asunder.
"It was a crocodile, there was no doubt
4n our minds; and so busily engaged was
it that it did not see the boat until it
had covered live or six feet more. Then
the harpoon r leaned back, and, as the
big head turned, he threw the iron.
" 'Well struck I' cried some one. as the
iron hit the animal, trembling as it kept
its place. Then the great tail came hiss
ing out of the water, struck the slender
mast (the man dropping into the bottom
of the boat) and broke it off as cleverly
as though it had been done with a knife.
" "Look out for the line! Jump to wind
'ard. Stern all hands!' were the orders
that followed, as. in those few seconds,
the crocodile had mado a desperate rush,
jerked the boat so rapidly to one side
that she almost tipped over, and was now
ay. ~y like a race horse, headed for the
mainland, with an omlnou3 wave in front
that threatened now and then to come
aboard and swamp the light craft. We
all laid low, as far in the stern as we
could get, to keep the bow out of water
while the steed raced on.
"I knew we would have to stop this be
fore we reached shallow water, as the ani
mal would make a rush over some shallow
and break the rope; so when we had gone
perhaps half a mile I took the line; passed
it aft and we all began to haul in. This
only excited our racer to more fervent
efforts, and he turned suddenly, again
almost tipping over the boat. We
gradually gained on him until final
ly the boat's bow was .^S?li
over his sla^hinp tail
that was beating jOF& r F r^'~ "' ' ' ' x
the surface wltb jfifgjl&pii&z .--.â¢ Â¦'- '~LÂ«J*&x
clnpr him along. We had a rifle in the
boat and my man now took it, and,
aiming: at the nock, fired. There was
little doubt as to its effect, as the croco
dile stepped, plunger! hea.Â» down, striking
the bottom in the shallow water, and
seemingly standing on its head, swept the
surface with its tail like a whale. We had
the^oars rea^y and backed, but not before
one had been struc^ and broken and the
boat nearly filled.
"All at once," continued the planter
after a short pauso. "our game righted
and plunged aht-ad savagely, then swam
in a circle, and finally keeled over, where
upon we raised a shout of triumph and
hauled alongside. He was a beautyâ not
twenty feet long, by any means, but at
least fifteen; a splendid specimen of a
sea-going crocodile. As he was too large
to tow in it was decided to haul him
aboard. To accomplish this the seats
were lifted out and a rope made fast to
his tail, and he was then slowly and care
fully hauled In; finally, when the body
was balanced across the boat he was
slung around and dropped in lengthwise.
The seats were then put on top of the
body, and, flushed with victory, we started
for camp, now in sight.
"It was rather difficult to use the oars,
as the animal was higher than the gun
wale, but we made fairly satisfactory
progress and were close enough to camp
to shout the news, when the unexpected
happenedâ an earthquake would not have
created greater consternation. The dead
crocodile rose into the air as if impelled
from below, forming a great hoop and
lifting seats and oarsmen several feet,
then dropped back and began a series
of struggles that turned the* tables
completely. Seizing the forward >J
seat in its jaws it ground and
twisted the soft pine, while

er.tly the water poured in, sending us all
overboard. I jumped just ahead of the
flying tail that sounded like a whiplash
when it struck, the other men either fall
ing or rolling overboard.
"Fortunately the water was not over
throe feet in depth, so we waded to a safe
distance, and, powerless to do anything,
awaited the end. It soon came. The
crocodile cleared tne docks, literally, re
gained its upright position and crawled
over, sinking the beat, which rolled and
{lumped him into his natural element,
when with a rush he was off. As the
boat moved away we flung ourselves after
her. clinging to the rail; and for a short
distance the saurian towed us all. But
the boat, full of water, was too much for
a long tow, and he soon quieted down and
began to swim in a circle while we towed
the boat in shore. We finally reached
near enough to get a rope, which we
fastened to the boat and to a tree. Then
we held a council of war.
â¢'The crocodile was at the bottom. In a
little pool about four feet deep, still lash
ing his tail and rising at any attempt to
drag him up, but the rope was still about
his tail, and, after much difficulty, was
secured and made fast' to another rope;

tor's father and uncle. "Where is it?"
Mr. O'Reilly knew very well what he meant, but the
fierce challenge for- the moment had left him unready
fo explain.
"Where's the insult, I say?" repeated Murray senior.
"Oh. 'tisn't always in words that an insult or slur is
cast. There's looks â "
"An' you'd put manings to a man's looks an' hang
him for 'em? An insult in a man's looks? O'Reilly, I
know the signification an' maning of this. 'Tis" jeal
ousy, mane, vicious jealousy, because your bpsthoon of
a son failed in college, an' my son, Dr. Murray here,
came out in a blaze of glory â "
"Father!" expostulated the doctor, rather shame
facedly and in an annoyed low tone.'
"Yes," shouted the elder Murray, "because my son
has Latin an' Greek enough to spare to supply three
parishes like Innisdoyle, because he has learning suffi
cient to land him wherever his fancy would aim â from
the dispensary of his native town to the highest coort
in Europe! â an' your awlawn of an ignoramus hasn't
a word to throw to a dog â "
Mr. O'Reilly was white and speechless with passion,
and it was painful to Hally to witness the condition to
which he was reduced. Besides, all this talk about
Greek and Latin was really a tacit insult to himself, who
had had no college and little other educational advan
tages, and yet who was able, he considered, to "take his
own part" as well as most people. â¢
"The highest coort in Europe!" he cried derisively.

THERE was great consternation in Innisdoyle.
Typhoid fever had broken out in Church lane,
and the doctors attributed it to the bad quality
of the drinking water. For ages the people had
gone to the town pump, whose supply had never
been known to fail. The water was dcliciously cool in
the hottest weather and no crystal ever sparkled more
rjearly. But in these days of all sorts of disquieting
knowledge the glittering clearness, taken in connection
Â»"ith the well's position at the foot of the churchyard
fciope, put an idea into the head of young Dr. Murray
(who was on the lookout for ideas), and he quietly sent
a sealed bottle of the water to the Government Analyst
in Dublin, who found it "teeming" with Horrifying and
"most dangerous" growths. Dr. Patsy scored a great
triumph with his letter on the subject to Cyprus Col
lins, the chairman of the Board of Guardians, who was
a nervous man an "abstainer." If the very water
failed one. what on earth was to be done? The towns
people were deeply impressed: the typhoid outbreak
which the Dublin analyst bore out Patsy in tracing to
the water supply was a serious thing. More than once
when the fever had made its appearance in Innisdoyle
:t had gained such ground that six months had not seen
the end of it, and business of every kind had been par
aiyped. It would never do to tolerate the old bad order
of things that led to these epidemics. The pump mu<t
be done away with and a regular water works con
structed in connection with a wholesome out-of-town
veil or lough.
The country people, less alive to the monetary los?,
took it more calmly. They were incurious about ihe
"growths" found by the analyst- â believing vaguely that
they were "something in the nature of water-flays or
things of that kind." and could not conceive how such
trifles could be hurtful. Of course if the flays were
"sizeable" enough to be visible to the naked eye. then,
perhaps, the matter might be worthy of attention, for
anybody could understand that a number of these intro
duced into the human digestive apparatus might prove
disagreeable tenants. But things that it took strong
glasses (they were not sure whether it was glasses oi
whisky or "telescopes ') to discover â it was a shame,
nothing else, for grown men, heads of families, to be
wasting time over. There was always some fright or
ether up with them sanitary schamers in Dublin. If it
wasn't the manure pit at the farmer's door â the most
useful and harmless bit of property in the possession of
ihe cultivator of the soil â or some bother about white
washing the house inside as well as out. it was sure to
be some trouble about milk-vessels or the water supply.
But of course the idle awlawns had to be doing some
thing or pretending ioAo itâ stirring up some kind of
Â»n alarm, at any rate, in order to make an excuse for
drawing their big salaries. And still, on the other
hand, it could not be denied that the fever was a visi
tation that could very well be spared, and if by any
chance there was some connection between itself and
the water (the most unlikely things were possible),
't'Aas as well to let the affair be talked over and under
stood, so far as there was any understanding to be had
in the case. Every one was pleased, therefore, when it
was decided that the question would be fully discussed
by the board on its next meeting day.
The affair awoke much interest among the "intelli
gent" people of that end of the county, and all the local
papers sent their reporters to the meeting. Not a guar
dian was absent. Each man felt that now or never was
an opportunity for figuring before his section of the
ratepayers as a man of sense and energy, and that, pump
or waterworks, he would prove himself to be the right
c:an in the right place.
Dr. Murray read his statement in a way that excited
the admiration of his father and uncle to the highest
pitch. Here was a doctor of their own â a Murray! â
laying down life and death to Innisdoyle. They looked
around as the splendid Latin and polysyllablcd Eng
lish rolled on in a superb flood, and it was this look.
implying so much superiority and pride, when Patsy
sat down after the reading, bedewed with the sweat of
r.ob'e effort, that first turned the current of the meet
ing's thoughts.
"A â him! the Murray*! The devil can't stand 'em
after this." whispered Mr. O'Reilly to his brother-in
law. Hally, of the drapery-shop.
"Upon my soul, 'tis too offensive for endurance."
the latter replied. "I never saw such a raally undelicate
exhibition of vulgar vanity and consatc. But what
could you expect from the like of 'cm â ignorant bost
hoons!"
"Well, gentlemen," said the chairman, heavily, for the
recital of the list of germs found in the pump water, and
the description of wells issuing from near the boun
daries of old graveyards, had made him very weak in
teriorly, "this is a terrible sarious subject and one that,
however revolting to the natural stomach of men, > we
are yet bound to discuss in the interests of the rate
payers of this Unionâ"
"Of the people at large, Mr. Chairman." corrected
Dr. Patsy, with a kind of tolerant but superior smile,
"the danger is by no means confined to the ratepayers."
"IIâ m! Well now that's what I call a superflewous
remark entirely," said Mr. O'Reilly. "I'd even be in
clined to call it slightly insulting to the chairmanâ"

Charley Green, a rural guardian, in a tone whose satis

The looks of new-born distrust and recoiling with
which the others regarded him seemed to paralyze
Shannon. But he knew, none better, what a word of
suspicion at the meetings could do, and so he pulled
himself together.
"Wasn't it yourself, you melted villain of a hypo

in-law that* began all the talk about the O'Dells?"
A strained look took possession of O'Dell's face.

his poisonous tongue? " shrieked Mr. Fox. "Now I
know who ruined my prospects last Shrove. He un
derstood well that I was in treaty with the Rourkcs for
Bidalia an' that's why he spread the report that my

hadn't a school taicher in my family since Adam was a
boy. Was it," he cried frantically, "that you wanted
to get in with the Rourkes yourself, you with that ouM
servant-maid for a grandmother?"
"If she was a servant girl." cried Mr. Hennesiy.
who had not hitherto taken. part in the discussion, but
who, having married a person of the kind alluded to,
considered himself grossly insulted now as well nj
Shannon, "if she was a servant-girl, she was at the

any other man's wife in the parish. As good? I
wouldn't compare her the same day â a managing,
smart, well-handled woman â with the sthreeis in ha!:
the houses that don't "know tlie difference between a

"Oh we all know why you're spaking up for the

Was it likely?" he cried, harking back to the subject
that Hehnessy had interrupted, "that a fellow would be
taken up by the Rourkes. high-stepping, solid people,

with a panting effort to restrain himself. "I believe,

Things were looking dangerous, as they well ccÂ»uM

were nearly all men Who did a bit of horse-dealini;
when opportunity offered, put for the present all

meeting was closed abruptly.

the Coast Range, Of these forests, orig
inally 80,000,000 of acres In extent, but 15,
030 000 remain In their virgin Btate after
thirty years of cutting. About 600,000
acres a year, therefore, seem to have dis
appeared under the combined aggressions
of the woodman's ax and the devouring
fire.
Of the Â¦empervirens only about 1,400,000
acres now exist, and this, it is estimated,
oontains not more than 47,000,000,000 feet bf
lumber. Not all of the timber in the above
estimate stands In accessible situations.
One acre of redwood will cut from 30,000
to 60/500 feet. Single trees have cut as
much as 80,000 feet of first-class lumber,
and on Russian" River one operator cut
14,000,000 feet from 160 acres of land. This,
howerer, was undoubtedly one of the best
Quarter-sections In the entire forest.
Care must be exercised In the selection
ci a -proper tree to fell, else, as It "has
often occurred, when It Is upon the
ground. It may be found so defective that
it will not make even second-class lum
ber. Certain trees, for unexplained rea
sons, have a creased fashion of growing.
Instead of the trunk being a sound, uni
form body. It will be found to have great
longitudinal fissures In It. extending near
ly through to the heart. Theee may num
ber a dozen or more, breaking into the
rings with crevasses two or three inches
apart, the Bpace being filled with bWk.
So thick Is the coating of bark upon the
tree that until it is cut down this defect,
though It may be suspected, is not dis
cernible. These trees are also often rot
ten at the core, which, of course, in
creases their nnavallability. 80 it may
occur that one walking over an area from
which the woodmen have taken all they
desire may find standing trees of large
size which, it would seem, would make
excellent lumber. And surprise may be
expressed that the cutters passed them
by. They have all been examined and
condemned, however, and condemnation
in the forest is to allow a tree to remain
standing. It is the work of two men for
from six hours to two days to cut down
a redwood tree and the cost is from $5
to $12. 80 mistakes In judging the quality
of timber In a standing- tree are to be
avoided.
It is a most Interesting sight to behold
one of these* forest giants fall. The pro
cess of cutting is effected both through
the use of the ax and the saw. All axes
are double-faced, through which much
time is naved In sharpening. Sometimes
the axes start the cut. on both sides of
the trunk and at places about opposite
each other through the thickness of the
tree. After the chopping has penetrated
.to a depth of about two feet on -aeh side
th saw is then started in the line of the
incision and the job completed with that
Instrument. Generally, however, the di
rection upon which the tree is to fall Is
determined and a cut is made In- that
side to the depth of from one to three
feet. Then the choppers pass to the op
posite side and begin sawing at a point
several feet higher than the place of tho
incision. As the saw moves through the
heart of the giant he begins to sag dewn
on the side where the wound is gaping.
In dofng this he lifts apart the cut and
opens the section which the saw is mak
ing, thereby keeping free play for ;he
saw. This is aided at times by driving
wedges at the place where the saw en
tered. Presently it is apparent that the
kind of pitying sense comes over you, as
though you had been witness to a tragedy.
The prone monster seems to be some vast
animal, which, after a stout resistance,
had Buccumbed, and whose body Is now
stretched before you for its final spolia
tion." This sense is all the more pro
nounced as you observe the choppers
quickly run over tho trunk with their
axes and cut away all the branches, each
limb going like a veritable amputation.
The great torso which emitted such sound
and displayed such motion a moment ago
Is now low and helpless, giving scarcely a
whimper as its parts are struck from it.
Almost before you can recover, yourself
the long ptalk is bare of limbs, and then
the men begin crosscuttlng it into logs, or
sections, of from twenty-four to thirty
feet, as long as It is desired that the
boards Into which it is to be reduced at
the mill shall be. This done, the logs are
peeled of their bark, the crowbar being
used to pry off the thick lnteeumen. which
is sometimes a foot in depth, the log be
ing turned with jackscrews, when such
!s practicable, to get at the under side.
This done, the next problem is one of
transportation. To drag the behemoth
out of his native abode and get him to a
pen or place where he can be sliced into
thin, pieces and made as portable and as
utterly beyond identification as meat in a
butcher shop in this is the next aim. The
donkey engine, which contains a winze
for the winding up of rope, , is brpught
into proximity, and a great system
of tackles are arranged, . whereby the
logs are drawn into line. The great tree
which we saw fall had been so cut up,
and Morgan Backus caught with his
camera the chu-chuing donkey engine Just
when it had braced itself with a vast
process of ropes to draw the logs in posi
tion for a down slope movement. It was
then that a bevy of beeves seized the fore
most log with a big chain and started on
a 1a 1 downhill haul. The procession was pre
ceded by a Chinese water bearer yoked
to two buckets, who dashed water on the
ground over which the logs were to pass.
A road had been constructed along the
mountain side for just this kind of use.
and the purpose of this wetting was to
make the road slippery so the logs would
easily slide.
The oxen moved on a slow, quiet gait,
and in a few minutes they were' at the
foot of the hill, where a little engine at
the head of a long train of trucks was
backed upon a track ready to receive the
severed remains of the fallen Titan.
The shrieks and screams of this locomo
tive resounding through the forest is one
of the most startling features of the en
tire situation, and frightens alike stranger
men and stranger animals. It has often
occurred that following a blast of the
whistle violent crashing sounds have been
heard close by. which rapidly recede and
finally cease; they testify the presence of
some bear that had wandered close to the
logging scene and had taken alarm at the
whistle; while such tender animals as deer
and hares, animals with long ears, which
maenily sound, whose safety lies in their
discerning danger from a distance, have
been stricken dumb by the sudden yell of
a whistle reverberating through the grove
with a worse than thunder detonation.
The cars clank out bearing their burden
of logs, like a long funeral cortege mov
ing to some place of interment. They
proceed to a mill standing beyond a
broad lake into which, the logs are
dumped.
It is necessary that prior to working
through the mill the logs should become
soaked. Wet redwood cuts on the saws
like cheese, but when It is dry it is tough
and hard to handle. We saw the men
In the pond direct a big log to the skids

two whirling disks, one revolving: from
above, the other below, had bit into the
leg with their savage teeth and were
rapidly slicing from its side a convened
slab; this was repeated on all sides until
the log was squared, after which it was
run to a bandsaw and cut into boards.
These were taken to an edger. which is
a series of circular saws operating upon
the plane of a table, spaced at definite
distances ap-rt, which cuts a slab of the
leg to the width of boards desired and
where the beards are trimmed. Follow
ing this, if it is desired to smooth one or
both sides of the planks, they go to the
planers, where rapidly their snagcy coax
is removed and a perfectly spllnterless
and almost polished surface Is imparted
to them.
Away they go then to the trucks and
on to the ocean's verge, where on a
bit of headland and in a bight of the
coast there is spread a platform with a
hoist on supports. Beside this, when
the surf permitted, schooners would
come to load; and they would take on
board the lumber of the mill and with
it rock on down to San Francisco. ThlÂ«
bit of mechanism was the last incident
in the long story of the tree from Its
stump â¢by its forest Blade to the fin
ished article now bounding on down the
coast to its ultimate utilization. As I
saw the vessel lift her sails and bend
away my mind recurred to that forest
sweep and to the part over which tho
men with their axes, their engines, oxen
and trucks had passed and left aban
doned. Only the blanched ghosts of a
few young trees, intermingled with a
sprinkling of healthy withes, contrasting
with ruins of stately spires, remained;
it was a wild expanse, desolate and drear;
the wind moaned through it, and the sun
struck his tierce rays everywhere
throughout its area: would it come again
to grow tall and noble trees, fringin thÂ«
heavens with their feathers, brushing It
with their plumes? It was hard to think
to. yet tho forest may revive and restore
itself; surely now from this tract ltÂ»
glory was departed, and tha great plants
Â¦which embraced the winds with their
thousand arms were now fallen and
gone, ripped into planks or chopped into
shingles, carried away an their place
would kn ,w them no more. It was a
lonely contemplation, and as wo turned
to the train that night and rolled out
of the region of forests, we could not
but feel that the time might even como

THEATRESTHIS MAN HAS A ROBBER TONGUE
SCIENCE has enabled a man to
go through life with an arti
ficial nose and limbs that often,
defy detection, but -one of the
most novel inventions of modern
surgery is a tongue mads of rubber
and resting on a pivot set between
the teeth. There is a man in this
city who can show this wonderful
mechanism and who feels very happy
becausa he has it.
This man is Georga Henderson.
He is 47 years old and for many years
had been an inveterate smoker, often
using fifteen cigars a day. Excessive
use of tobacco caused a cancer of the
tongue, and the organ had to be re
moved. This operation was most dif
ficult and was performed in Bcllevue
Hospital last February.
It was necessary to saw through
the lower jaw at the center and re
move two lower front teeth, together
with a portion of the jawbone on
either side of these teeth. When
this was done the surgeons removed
two-thirds of the anterior part of the
tongue, leaving only the base of the
organ. The severed ends of the jaw
were united with wire.
Henderson then left the hospital,
the' surgeons giving him little hope
of ever being able to eat solid food.
The base of the tongue healed in a
few weeks, but in spite of the care
with which the surgeons adjusted the
wire about' the two sides of the jaw
the bone would not unite. The sides
of the jaw began to move unevenly
and the tissue to inflame.
Mr. Henderson. finally went to the
New York College of Dentistry,
where Dr. Frederick Bradley took
charge of his case. He sawed
through the jaw again and adjusted
its sides evenly, bringing them in as
close impact as possible. A metal
cap was placed over all of the lower
teeth and held in position by a clamp
on either side of the mouth fastened
under the chin. After the patient
had worn this for five weeks it was
removed, and it was found that the
severed parts of the jaw had united.
Henderson was still unable to eat
solid food, because he had no tongue
to pass it back into the oesophagus.
To overcome this difficulty the sur
geon constructed an artificial tongue.
A rim of gold was made to fit the
inner surface of the lower teeth.
This was beveled off toward the
lower edge and attached to a wire
clasp which fitted over one of the
back teeth on either side. A bar of
German silver was fastened across
the mouth from one of the back teeth
to another opposite. This was in^
closed in a tube of the same metal of
sufficient size to permit it to rotate
easily on the bar. A tongue of red
vulcanized rubber was made to fit
about the tube. The rear of the rub
ber tongue was beveled off toward
the bottom and placed under the base

the sonnet. To those who were charmed

is obvious, for although the sonnets wrre

in this country and In England, it was the
Judgment of those interested that the
poet had added nothing to his reputation.
His strength and his keen feeling for art
fit him for the sonnetâ his return to it
was predetermined.
Technically the sonnets of "Echoes of
Greek Idyls" are superior to those of Sir.
Mifflin's earlier volumes. Alliteration is
not so obtrusive, and the delight in color
and sound, which to the taste of some
readers seemed to approach the barbaric,
has been refined. As sonnets these
poems are, eminently successful; but as
translations, the sonnets demand compar
ison with the originals. It is, of course,
impossible to reproduce in another lan
guage a real piece of literature, AH the
subtile, associational force of words which
gives it individuality must be lost. Lloyd
Mifflin, in giving us first of all good Eng
lish literature, infusing into his work as
much of the spirit of the Greek idyl as
may be. has chosen the only tolerable al
ternative to literal prose translation.
There is one respect, however, leaving
all subtler considerations, in which the
work before me differs noticeably from
the original. This difference will appear
even by comparison with a literal prose
version.

Compare with this a prose translation,
almost literal, by Andrew Lang:
"Fair was the form of Cypris while
Adonis was living,* but her beauty has
died with Adonis. 'Woe, woe for Cypris!*
the mountains are saying, and the oak
trees answer 'Woe for Adonis!' The riv
ers bewail the sorrows of Aphrodite, and
the wells are weeping Adonis on the
mountains. The flowers flush red for an
guish, and Cytherea through all the
mountain-knees, through every dell doth
shrill the piteous dirge: 'Woe, woe for
Cytherea! He hath perished, the lovely
Adonis!' and Echo cries in answer 'He
hath perished, the lovely Adonis!' "
In both sonnet and prose translation the
same objects are named: there is in both
the same oscillation from Venus of the
many names to Adonis, and from Adonis
to Venus. By the movement of his verse
the .writer of the sonnet has even ob
tained the effect of the echo in the origi
nal. But they differ in tills; in the prose
translation as In the- Greek, everythingâ

Odd Superstitions.
Of all the unaccountable superstitions
that prevail, the most unaccountable,
perhaps, are those that relate to bees.
Throughout the north of England. hz\<\
especially in rural York-hire, the be'le*
Is firm that bees always know in advance
when misfortune will befall their owners.
"Whenever, therefore, they hum in a cer
tain low disconsolate fashion, tf\e owner
of the hive, if a true northerner, has
never a doubt that disaster is at
hand for him or his. If there be Illness
in a house, in the Yorkshire Dale 3, an
anxious watch is always kept oa the
hives. One by one the members of the
family will creep down the garden to scs
what the bees are doing. If they are
found to be at work as usual, quietly
gathering honey, it is heid to be a s'.gii
that the patient will recover; but if they
are buzzing around in a slate of unrest,
then it 13 known that there is danger, and
weeping and wailing begin at once. I!
they seem Inclined to desert their hive
that is the worst sign of all, tha sign
that there is no hope for recovery. If in
that part of the world the owner of a
beehive dies, some member of his family
always goes oft at once to tell the bees.
The messenger kneels down by the side
of the hive and whispers tn at the door:
"John Metcalf"â or whatever the person's
name may beâ "John Metcalf is dead, and
I am come to tell the bees." He â or more
often it is sheâ repeats the words three
times, and then hastens back to tha
house: for a piece of crape must be found
and tied to the top of the hive before sub
set. If the bees are not told of the death
of their owner, with due ceremony, too.
or if their badge of mourning bÂ» not
hoisted at the proper time, they will all
die within a month â so at least the Dales
folk and their northern kith and kin be
lieve firmly.
There are some superstitions that are
fairly universal, as, for instance, that oJ
the death tick. In England, France.
Germany and Austriaâ possibly other
countries, tooâ whenever that little tick
ing is heard, the ticking as of a watch
In the distance, women, and men. too,
sometimes, look at one another with fear
in their eyes and wonder whose doom It
Is that is being sounded. Then sailors of
all nations pin their faith to corpse can
dles, as they call the St. Elmo lights that
play around the ma3ts of ships In. stormy
weather. Any one on whom a candia
lights they regard as a man marked out
for drowning; and If the candles rua
down on the deck, the ship, too, they lock
on as doomed â doomed never again to en
ter harbor. The superstition with regard
to magpies is also one that seems to pre
vail throughout Europe, and always !n
precisely the same form; north, jouth, east
and west the peasants believe that it Is
unlucky to see one magpie, lucky to sÂ«e
two; that to see three means a wedding,
and to see four a birth.
On the other hand, many of these popu
lar beliefl are peculiar to some special
district. For Instance, in East Anglia
and apparently nowhere else an odd su
perstition prevails with regard to slip
pers. There no prudent mother would
ever think of allowing her daughter to
work a pair of slippers for any youns
man whom she wishes her to marry, and,
above all. not for one to whom she 13
engaged. For it Is a saying that "He who
Is given slippers slips away." There is
much ' the same feeling with regard to
giving or receiving scissors or knives, as
such presents are popularly supposed to
be used by the fates as intruments where
with to sever the ties between true lov
ers and friends. Not to very lonsr aeo

IN "A History of American Privateers'*
K. S. Maclay has d*>alt with a prac

ficult to obtain, would comparatively
soon ha*, o been lo;-t irrecoverably if
It Kid Tint been collected by his diligence.
How great that diligence must have been
Is very Plain to the reader of his narra

the work: "In writing nis history of the

official reports and other reliable records
on which to base his work, but In at

fragmentary and scattered records which
are i'j be found in the periodicals of that

the descendants of our privateersmen.

is known only to those who have had to
depend em any enterprise upon the co
operation of a large number of corre
spondents. The papes Â«<r the book give
Silent but impressive testimony to the
labor of the author. Merely to find cut
th* name's t>X the treat number of prl
\uteers mentioned was ;i v.ork of no
tr:!;;!ig magnitude, and the gathering of
details In regard to their service must in
any eases have Â»>een a very tedious and
CUSeult ta:-'K.' A single paragraph, giving
the history of an obscure vessel, its name
and place, the dates of its adventures, the
Dames and value of its captures, may

"The importance of the subject is shown
convincingly by the statistics presented
a::d by quotations from the English pa
pers during the wars in which the United
States w< re engaged with Great Britain.
During the Revolutionary War the reg
ular naval force fell from over thirty ves
f-rls U> seven, while the number of priva
teers grew from seventy to 45'Jâ falling off,
it Is true, to a little over SW in the last
>car of the war. In other words, the
number eif privateers, never less than two
or three times as great as of Government
vessels, was for a while tifty times as
great, with an armament almost In the
Fame proportion. The records show that
thÂ»- effectiveness of the private compared
with that of the Government force was
about In the ratio of four to one. The
work of these maritime forces has been
unduly subordinated in common estima
tion t<Â» th*Â» achievements of the Revolu
tionary army. The historian calls atten
tion to the capture by men-of-war and
privateers of a large number of British
eoldicrs and states that in the period dur-

British merchant looked forward to the

cost several million pounds annually to

1"t more than offset by the British mer

commerce that struck the mortal blows to
British supremacy in Americaâ not Sar.i

Tl'*>se assertions are supported by cita
tions from English newspapers, letters
ewi speeches and at the same time curi
ous evidence of the impression produced
on the mind of the British public by
American naval success. The most strik
ing of all the facts brought out in these
documents is that the very waters of
England itself ceased to bÂ« safe, the linen
flert sailing from Ireland to England
under convoy, and the British Channel

Caricus privateers.
The narrative of Mr. Maclay"s history
consists in the main of the account of
the careers of individual ships, often in
pretty full detail. The reckless audacity
the Ingenuity, the persistence against
odns apparently overwhelming, and the
success of the privateersmen raises the
reader's wonder and excites admiration

of the risks t>f privateering and the occa

make a privateer's life seem Ignoble, a
reader is not surprised to learn that old
, Piivateersmcn lost their fitness for regu
lar and useful occupations in time of
peace. The whole effect or the book is
to cause satisfaction that a system so
liable to abuse is at an end.
Mr. Maclay brings against privateering
a number of objections from the point of
view of the student of organized mari
time warfare. These objections are that

Rgainst the war vessels of the enemy. A
privateer, for example, would never de
liberately seek an action with a prepon
derant force, courting destruction in order
to cripple the enemy. Yet though priva
teering is so plainly condemned, the nar
rative of Mr. Maclay leads naturally to
the inference that the destruction of an
energy's commerce by the seizure of mer-
way stands out distinct. In the sonnet
they are subordinated to the prevailing
mood, and only the last picture stands out
in classic distinctness. The difference
here Is due to the sonnet form, which by
its intertwining rhymes and Its structural
compactness weaves the part Into the
whole. The difference is more not.ceable
in the quatrain following the- sonnet quot

9What F. R,. Woolseu. M. D.. of the University of California,
thinks of Boatimg as Compared With football.
O CIENTJFIC FOOTBALL, so
O called, is rapidly becoming the
favorite collegiate and academic
sport of to-day, while rowing is
popular only among a few of our
ilder colleges.
Past experience with that of to
day has demonstrated without a
doubt that football should be in
dulged in only by those who are so
traiiwd and physically adapted.
Rowing is open to all â the weak
est and the strongest. TJic invalid
can here find a sport readily adapt
ed to his very want.
The physical training adapted
for the tzvo is partially along the
same lines. For football the
strength to endure physical exertion
of the extreme type and most vio
lent form, both on the offensive and
defensive, is demanded. This vio
lent exertion is not gradually at
tained, but is a sudden burst of,
energy cither on the offensive or de
fensive. If on the offensive the
strength is taxed to its limit, while
on the defensive that limit is too
often passed and zve have a phy
sically overpowered and overtaxed
condition.
Here it is that the Undeveloped
muscles are overcome and the evil
results of such rapidly follow.
The training for rowing is upon
a more uniform basis. The mus
cles are here gradually developed to
attain a rhythmic motion and by this
means are brought to a more nearly
perfect condition. The defensive
pozvers arc not colled into play and
the forced defense of football, which
too often breaks bones, severs the
attachments of ligaments, etc., is an
[unknown quantity.
The physical injuries received at
rowing are as nothing as corn
pa) cd with football.
The dusty or perhaps muddy
gridiron upon which tzventy or
more men almost continually form
a wriggling mass is not conducive
to the best respiratory conditions,
while the course over which a race
is rowed is a tonic of itself.
F. R. WOOLSEY, M.D.
President Wheeler Considers Rowing the Ideal University Sport
and finest Type of physical Co-operation.
E> OWING is good sport. In
-*â¢â¢- the first place it keeps the
men on the water generally, in
healthful surroundings. It sub
jects them to definite discipline,
whether that of the coach, or of the
captain who sits in the boat. It re
quires the finest . type of physical
co-operation. This co-operation
goes even beyond that required in
football. A good crew is not a
body of oarsmen working together ,
but is a perfect machine, in which
every part fits into its place noise
lessly and without jar. A good
coach zvill not spend much time in
training individual oarsmen after
the first few weeks of training have
passed. He will spend his time in
Hatching the action and movement
of the boat as a zvlwle, and if any
thing goes wrong with that, will try
to find out where the difficulty is.
Risk oÂ£ strain or injury under
proper training is relatively small,
the tasks exacted are regular, be-
I7: S apportioned evenly according to
time and days. A student is not
obliged to neglect his university
zi-ork in order to participate in rozv
ing. The competitive events are
generally appointed for sonic time
outside the college term. All these
reasons combine to make rozving
one of the best, if not the very best,

THE SUNDAY CALL.

WILL ROWING SUPERSEDE FOOTBALL
IN CALIFORNIA
THTC advent of Professor Benjamin
Ide Wheeler into the presidency of
the University of California precip
itates an interest in, collegiate and â¢
intercollegiate boating which nas
not been manifest since ISO 2. Presi
dent Wheeler Is an old Yale oarsman and
a recognized authority upon the technique
of rowing and the general features of the
pport. While at Cornell he was as far a
spirit of the racing events as was com
mensurate with his office of professor, and
his published views upon phases of the
eport and past contests aided not a little
In guiding the opposing teams In the re
fined and scientific principles of the art.
It is from this standpoint that the pro
fessor is an enthusiast upon the pastime.
He likes it because it is a healthful, ~pir
lted exercise, calling into play all the â¢
muscles of the body, developing the phy-
Fique to the highest possible standard. It
Is a cleanly exerc!se, unlike football,
which is really a dirty game, with the
players half the time sprawling in the
dust, and it is safe for one to pursue.
There is no danger of broken necks, arms
or legs, as in football; moreover of mashed
fingers and clubbed thumbs, as in bu>e
bail. It is a sport in which all the exor
cise of skill possible to the other two
games may be employ ed. where brain iind
brawn must needs unite in the attainment
of excellence; and besides all this, it is
beautiful sport in the rxcrcise. What Is
prettier than a varnished shell pulled by
eight muscular men in steady, long-sway
ing stroke, shooting through tho water
with swift, synchronous impulses?
President Wheeler does not oppose the
othc-r sports, only he enthuses upon the
subject of rowing, and his discovery that
there were no contests with shells fce
twecn Berkeley and Stanford and that col
lfgiatc racing had never been taken up In
California made him feel that there was
a great dearth and lack In the wholj
realm of college athletics in the State.
"Berkeley has already produced a crew
and a regular organization able to make
contests," said the president recently,
"and the difficulty Is to get an opposing
crew to race. Of course, our men look
to a college team, and the source from
which they naturally expect a challenge
is from Stanford. This is as it should he.
College spirit should be kept up by the
universities with the help of each other.
When r addressed the Stanford students
recently I appealed to them to form a
boating club, select their crew, train
them and challenge Berkeley. I am sure
that boating could be made as popular
here and take as high a place among
sports and entertainment as it hoids
among the large colleges of the East.
The Yale, Harvard, Cornell and Pennsyl
vania regattas are great affairs and com
mand the attention and admiration of
thousands of people outside the colleges.
In these races sport Is exemplified In Its
highest phase, and the struggle Is watched
with as keen delight by the spectators as
is felt by the contesting crews. There
Is no reason why, with the great bay and
its many estuaries within ready reach of
both colleges, regattas should not be held
every summer, and they would certainly
be features of the season."
The crew and club to which President
Wheeler referred is the boating club of
the Berkeley University, which has come
to feel a new life since President Wheel
er arrived. It was organized In 1592 by
Jewett Morrow, the Impulse which im
pelled its organization being . the great
intercollegiate boa trace which took place
at Chicago during the World's Fair.
Berkeley's design was to race Stanford,
to go to Chicago and beat the California
crew on the lake. The Stanford lads
were then full of the idea of having a
club and crew, and a subscription was
taken up. from which a considerable sum
of money was raised to purchase equip
ment, to which fund Senator Stanford
was 'a principal contributor. The Stan
ford affair, however, never got fairly
under way. the zeal of the leaders sub
siding before the organization got on its
feet. Since that time Stanford has been
quiescent upon the subject of boatracins,
though the university is but a few miles
from a branch of the bay upon which a
course could be staked off ample for all
practice purpose.
Berkeley, however, did not allow her
efforts "to expire, though it flagged con
siderably, and lacking the stimulus of. op
position, was at one time on the verge of
failure. This occurred after the elab
rate and artistic boating house with all
its contents of sculls was destroyed by
fire, about four years ago. Another boat
house was built. :md gradually new
barges were bought, until now, in addi
tion to practice boats, the club owns two
outrigger skiffs, smooth bottomed, and
fair racing crafts though they are not
shells. When the indications during the
past summer became strong that Pro
fessor Wheeler would be called to . the
presidency of the university new life was
immediately infused into the boating
club. The crew got together, went Into
training and resolved that this branch
of the college sports should be raised into
sufficient prominence at least to draw
the attention of Professor Wheeler.
Tho boats were only four and the oars
men comprised James Hopper, bow and
captain; P. W. Waggershauser, forward
waist; Roy Fryer, after waist; Clinton
Tracy, stroke, and Frank Wilder, cock
swain. The desire of the crew was to
row at the races of the Pacific Athletic
Association, which came off at El Campo
in June. This association, however, pass
ed a rule to allow no smooth-bottomed
boats on the course, a regulation which
it seemed would keep the university crew
off the track. They suc
ceeded, however, In bor
rowing the lapped barge
of the Pioneer Club, and
they entered the contest
with the Dolphin and
the Ariel crews. The
barge by reason of its
timbers being lapped
upon the edge was
much â¢ heavier than
the smgoth, light skiffs
which the Berkeleya
had been accustomed to
row. and it made less
speed through the water.
Still Berkeley won. beat-
Ing both contestants
upon a mile and a half
courseâ three-fourths of
a mllo down, then a
turn and- three-fourtb.3
of a mile back to the
flag stake-;.
Inspired by this vic
tory to attempt greater
things, the crew went
to Astoria to take part
In the regatta held
there under theauspiccs
of that city on August
23. It was the hope of
â¢ Berkeley men that they
could find some college
crew there to take up
their gauntlet and give
them a. chance to install
intercollegiate racing.
They did not succeed in
this, however, and for
the sake of getting a
race at all they were
forced to try against a
picked crew composed
of the Alameda Club,
whose members had ac
companied them from
Oakland to Astoria. As
they were out of the
class of these men. the
victory of the latterâ
. beating the collegiates
by over five minutes â
decided nothing, and
the Berkeley boy 3 were
given a silver cup and
the title of junlorcham
plons of the Pacific
Coast.
These little forays
rung spirit into the
crew, which was inten
sified by the lnstalla-"
tion of Professor
Wheeler, until now the
club is moving In the
matter of equipping
Itself with an eight
crew instead of a four,
whereupon It will be "full regular" and. â¢
with due training, ready to make con
tests anywhere. Two full eight size out
rigger shells will be bought at a cost of
$600 each, one being used to reinforce the
other in event of accident. These boats.
In addition to being proportionately light
er than the ones now used, sharper and
more effective in cutting the water, have
also the quality of being turned in thrre
strokes of the oars, possessing thereby an
Immense superiority over the boats now
used, which, though smaller craft, holding
but half the number of men. require,
nevertheless, fifteen strokes of the oars
to reverse their course.
The question of a coach has not yet
been decided upon, but the probabilities
are that for the present he will be a local
man; this is practicable just now, since
President Wheeler can be appealed to and
he will doubtless aid the coach with, his
advice and views upon up-to-date rowing.
The boathouse of the club is at Clinton
Station, East Oakland, and on the edge
of what has been pronounced as beautiful
a four-mile course as anywhere exists.
Â¦President Wheeler, however, objects to a
four-mile course as a mile too long and
an unnecessary strain on the oarsmen.
"So far as I can learn," remarked the
president, "all four-mile races In this
country have been settled at the three
mile point and the last mile is a mere
drag, pumping the vitals of the men. In
the interest of the health of the menâ
mostly young men of 19 to 22, to whom a
strain of the heart or other vital organ
In this last exhausting mile may mean a 1a 1
permanent injuryâ l urge the three-mile
standard. A crew that can win In three
miles can win In four; the last mile is a
libation of blood poured In ostentation to
the false, god of the English analogy."
With this strong expression of opinion
on the part of the president the four-mile
idea will doubtless be abandoned and the
course cut down to three miles.
The stroke which will be adopted will
be the Cornell stroke, a movement which
Is pronounced in its Americanism and i 3
in no sense an adaptation from the much
discussed English stroke. This has been
evolved at Cornell, under the eyes of Pro
fessor Wheeler, and doubtless with his
aid. This is a stroke of from thirty-three '
to thirty-four to the minute â a standard
which has not been quickened by Cornell,
except at the regatta at Henley, when it
was touched up to forty-two to forty-four
and resulted In the Englishmen beating
them. The slide which goes with the
slower stroke is nineteen to twenty
inches, while the faster movement was
executed at great expense of body swing
and consequent power of the oar's drive
in the water. With this longer and more
deliberate stroke the rhythm df motion of
the bodies of the rowers is beautiful to

One of the reasons. It Is hinted ainon*
the crew, why the- athletic students hivÂ»
not turned their attention to rowing Is be
cause of the difficulties of making an ex
hibition of a contest which would result
In profit to the clubs. A came of football
may be held within a board inc'.osure to
which none need be admitted except upon
payment. Football games, therefore, hayÂ«
always been productive of generous rums
falling: into the coffers of the clubs and
the pockets of the players, the- last Inter
collegiate game played yielding. It 1Â»
averred, upward of $10,000 in receipts.
Rowing, it has been thought, could not
possibly be conducted within an lnclosure
and it would be. hence, unrerauner&tlT*
to the participants.
It happens, however, that the lagoon
upon which it is proposed that the course
shall be laid runs beside a mole of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, and It Is
thought that by arrangement with this
company exclusive privileges could be had
of this tract for purposes of the race. AÂ«
the lagoon 13 quite wide, only an unsatis
factory view could be had of the boats
from the opposite- side, and as Its end
could be patrolled no boats would be al
lowed to pas 3 up Into It during or pre
paratory to the racing. Bows of seats
could then be erected along the railroad
side of the lagoon which could be sold at
the ordinary rates to spectators. In this
manner the clubs could reserve the right
of the sport to those that pay and hence
help defray the very considerable cost of
providing the expensive boats and equ!?
ment which make regattas possible.
The club as now organized has as Its
officers P. \V. YV'aggershauser, president;
J. A. Allen, vice president; Mr. Balrd, sec
retary, and James K. Moffitt treasurer.
Of these gentlemen only Mr. Waggers
hauser is of the crew. Since, however, the
club has determined to expand the or
ganization, there will probably be some
change in the personnel of the officers.
The club will shortly issue to the student
body a prospectus of its desires and In
tentions and will invite membership; from
the new blood that joins four men will be
selected to comprise the addition to the
crew, following which a new set of offi
cers will be elected. The members of the
club declare that they will, upon the In

Ftranger and on which I had no right to
look. But these peopleâ the sinners, who
appeared like striped phantoms behind tli<*
screen; and the sinned against, who stood
outside â were absorbed In their own af
fairs and despairingly indifferent to all
else.
Down in the corner nearest the door the
narrow, bent shoulders of a woman ar
rested my attention. Her story if an old,
old tale, of that feminine devotion that
men always expect but rarely appreciate.
Her husband's hands are stained with the
life blood of a fellow-employeâ an acci
dent of anger. The law has said that for
twenty years h<Â» must atone. Half of th*

The minutes sped by, and I got to
watching the tall, slender figure of a
woman in brown. She stood with one
knee resting on the stool beside her, and
her bony, nervous hands formed a sort of
trumpet for her mouth, which was pressed
close to the screen. With scarcely a
pause, for fully fifteen minutes she poured
forth a perfect torrent of words into tha
car of a big, brutish-looking convict.
As her allotted time drew to a close she
talked faster and faster, until finally I
heard him exclaim impatiently, "I can't
hear that." When the guard called at
last, "Time's up!" the fellow turned away
with a gruff "good-by," without one back
ward glance, while she stood, with
clenched hands, waiting in vain for a
farewell smile. As she turned to go out
she hesitated an instant and glanced
around the room with a look of Impotent
rape and despair pitiful to see. It was the
look that a wounded tigress might give

never mltsed seeing her husband on the

Days uf suffering and nights of weeping

Then the wife gave an example of rare
devotion. He had sinned for her, and,
though he begged her to do so, she would
not give him up. For a year he implored
her to get a divorceâ not to let him ruin
her life. At last, to satisfy him. ohe
yielded to his pleadings, and this was the
first time that she had seen him since the
law had set her free. Yes, a decree of
court had freed her, but the chains were
still about her heart, and now, with
streaming eyes, she told her husband that
she would not accept her releaseâ that she
could not. She had torn up the papers
and would wait for him to the end. Her
only comfort lay in tha knowledge that
one day he would be returned to her. and
she begged of him not to ask her again to
deprive herself of that ray of hope.
In strong contrast to this weeping, gold
en-haired girl wife, at the other end of
the railing sat an old mother. Far, far
hack in the golden days of California chis
woman had been a belle, and her Spanish
beauty had been the theme for many a

unforgiving. Now, however, he will not
even come to the prison, and the tiny old
lady, whose still bright eyes are the only
remnants of the beauty that mice made
her famous, makes her sad little journey
alone.

LONDON. Jan. 20.â One of thÂ© very
busiest men in London at thÂ« present
tlmo Is Lord Lonsdale. to whom thÂ«
Government has come to find horses and
saddles, two most vital necessities for the
South African campaign. Dealers are
coming to him all day long with saddles,
the weaknesses of which the Earl
speedily picks out with the quickness of
an expert. Here ia what Lord Lonsdalo
says concerning his work:
"On the 21st of December the adjutant
general asked me- whether I could supply
him with 1700 horses at once. I replied no,
but 1200 yes. . To-day I can find 1500 Eng
lish horses. 2000 Argentine. 2000 American.
100 Australian and pretty much aa many
as I want from Hungary."
"Critics say that your horses won't be
any good and that you are going to send
hunters, accustomed to luxury."
Lord Lonsdale quickly replied: "My!
Hunters! That clas3 of horses would not
stand work at all. What I am sending:
are horses from the fells and moors of
Cumberland and West Moreland. They
are horses accustomed to live on the
wildest kind of stuff. They are as hardy
as they can be. living among the rocks
and never having had a feed of oats in
their lives. Some have accused me of
buying fine horsse, too, but I know you
cannot get them too coarse. I have 757
such rough chaps. They have never seen
a stable. What we want is a wild, rough
horse and small. None I have bought ara
over 15.2. I have got 457 Canadian
horses. 1000 cowboy horses and 157 tough
little ponies, secured from people in the
midlands, who take no care of them and
keep them hardy."
"Are your preparations well forward
for the yeomanry?"
"Yes, perfect. If there are ten thousand
men to offer to-morrow I will engage
each. I shall have a service blannet and
waterproof mantle ' for each horse and
the best cavalry saddle. One thing I must
say. and that Is that the yeomanry are
being weakened by the addition of civil
ians, whereas what is wanted is rather a
few regulars among them to give them
backbone."
"Are the men good?"
"Yes, the best in the world. For In
stance, in my own regiment there are
some forty men who pass their lives
walking over the hills of my country
looking after sheep from early morning
till late at night. These fellows ara of
splendid material ana never tire."
"Do you think your horses will arrive
fit?"
"Certainly. I have got people working
with me who have made a science of
carrying horses and delivering them la
good condition."
"It is mostly a question of the box in
which the animals are sent. It must fit
exactly and not be too long so that the
horses are knocked about. Then, of
course, there is the matter of food.
American horses are excellent. They ax-

LONDON, Jan. 20.â T0 thoroughly and
conservatively appreciate the politi
cal conditions as they exist in Eng
land to-day, to understand the re
flections that military successes or
reverses in South Africa create in the
minds of the public and to gauge the task
confronting the Government at the forth
coming session of Parliament, It is first
necessary to realize the stupendous
change that in the last few weeks has
taken place in the national character. To
put it briefly, since the British army In
the field has found the Boer army wa3 its
match or more the British nation has be
come one huge stock exchange â not in
the material sense, but in sentiment. The
nation as a whole. governs its opinions by
the happenings of the hour, vacillating
according to the news the ticker, in its
traditions of centuries as easily as the
most nervous market that ever operated
in times of uncertainty. Nothing so ade
quately lends itself to a ready and force
ful simile of the prevailing temper of the
British nation aa the popular^ conception
of the stock market. As dn* the floor
there is a certain small percentage with
such huge interests at stalce that they
are never budged by rumors that make
or break the smaller fry. But these com
pose the very Inmost ring, and their ex
clusiveness may be judged from the fact
that one never knows when opening from
day to day such solid and conservative
journals as the Times, the Morning Post
or the Standard whether they will uphold
or bitterly abuse the Government. In a
like manner does the majority of the pub
lic opinion sway as fanned by news from
the front. Thus it is well nigh impossi
ble to determine the real feeling toward
the administration and the war, and it is
still harder to forecast the result of the
debates in Parliament.
Yet, in spite of this tremendous vacil
lation, the information which represen
tatives of the Associated Press have
gathered from all sorts of sources tends
toward the impression that Lord Salis
bury will continue not only in power, but
In the matter of votes, with but a slightly
diminished control, which is tantamount
to saying that the war against the Boers
will be pursued to the bitter end. regard
less of foreign interference and whlrf
perings at home.
The selection by the War Office of Major
General Sir Frederick Carrington for ser
vice at the front calls out the comment
that the Government has recognized this
officer's claims at a very late day, con
sidering the fact that his name is most
favorably known lin South Africa, where
he spent., almost his whole military ca
reer as a leader of expeditions. While
Sir Frederick Carrington's billet is at
present a mystery to the English press,
the correspondent of the Associated Press
is able to say that it was not, after all,
the initiative of the War Office that he
was called, and further, that he will be
intrusted with what will be practically
an independent command of large pro
portions and will attempt to achieve by
means of one of the most heterogeneous
forces ever gathered on the face of the
earth the gallant objective hitherto held
by the commanders in the field to be an
impossibility. â¢ '

BOERS FIGHT

All Their Victories Have Been

Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted, 1900. by James â¢ Gordon
Bennett.
ADEN, Jan. 20. â American passengers
on the steamer Konlg from the Transvaal
make the following statements concern
ing the war: The total of Boer losses in
the entire war In killed, wounded and
prisoners, including recent battles, does
not pxceed 800, and less than half the
adult Boers are now under arms, the Gov-
eminent not having yet required the serv
ice of all burghers. The Boers have am
munition to last for three years, and Pre
toria is provisioned for one year.
All the- Boer victories have been won by
'forces greatly Inferior to the British in
"numbers. The Boer plan of campaign is
purely defensive, and they . are confident
that .they, can maintain the Transvaal
borders against any number of British
i troops which can be sent against them.
Two of the three Americans with whom
I talked believe that the British cannot
successfully operate with less than 300,000
troops in the field, and the third was con
fident that the Boers w.ll eventually win.
They all agree that their prisoners- and
wounded -are being most kindly and hu
manely treated.
A gentleman whose name I cannot
quote, but who should know the Trans
vaal'side, gave me the following inter
view:
"The number of Boers in the 'field has
been greatly exaggerated. I am confident
that they have less than 25,000, but as
many more are ready to answer the call
'of the Government whenever needed.
Â¦ There are plenty 6t Mausers and ammu
!nition for all. | In no battle have the Boers
â¢had more. than 4000" men engaged. They
; had that number opposed to General Bul
ler at the Tugela.' ,
."At Nicholsons Nek the British had re
treated to a strong position on a rocky
kopje.. There they were isolated from
the rest of the army, and attacked by 1200
Boers. They lost 800 in killed and wound
ed,', and the rest surrendered. It was a

LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY THE BATTLING BOERS
REMSBERG, Cape Colony, Jan. 19.â A
gentleman who has : escaped from Coles
burg reports that the Dutch inhabitants
who are sympathizers with the Boers are
proceeding to the Orange Free State, in
anticipation of the evacuation of. the
town. Mr. Van der Walt, a member of
the Cape Assembly, has already "gone.
The Boer force there Is estimated to num
ber from 6000 to 7000 men, besides a strong
force at Norvals Pont. The British shells
did much execution eastward of the town.
The Boer loss up to date is probably 200
men. ,
Garef ully compiled figures . from repub
lican sources, some of - which have been
investigated and . found -to be correct,
show the Boer losses. up to date are, ap

baggage trucks to the reserved salon car

Ladles Blanford, Budler and Esser and
Mrs. Arthur Paget were seated.
After the Marlboroughs arrived a con
tingent of the National Fire Brigade Un
ion, of which the Duke of Marlborough
is president, arrived to bid him farewell,
and the railroad car in which the Duke
and Duchess and their friends sat be
came the center of attraction of the en
tire train. At thin moment Mrs. O. H. P.
Belmont arrived for the purpose of ac
companyinlg her daughter, the Duchess
of Marlborough, to Southampton. ,
The fire brigade men started cheers *as
the train pulled out, which were taken
up along the whole platform, the Duke
of Marlborough standing at the door of
the car smiling, acknowledging the cheer-
Ing.
The departure of the second detachment
of the London volunteers for South Af
rica this morning led to a repetition of
the scenes of enthusiasm of last Satur
day along the whole route from Welling
ton Barracks to Nine Elms station. The
Londoners commenced assembling before
daybreak, headed by several bands and
the volunteers, numbering 700 men, left
the barracks at 7:45, marching in fqurs.
For a time the people contented them
selves with cheering and the column ad
vanced In good order, until it reached
Great George street, where the friends.
wives and sweethearts of the men in
sisted on joining them and marching arm
in arm. Thus in the midst of constantly
Increasing enthusiasm the volunteers
finally reached the station at 9:30, where
the Duke of Connaught, the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs and other military and civic dig
nitaries had assembled. The volunteers
were rapidly entrained for Southampton
and steamed away to the strains of "Auld
Lang Syne" and "God Save the Queen."
Large crowds met the volunteers iat
Southampton and gave them a raging
send-off as they embarked on the trans
ports Ariosto, Kinsfaun Castle and Gaul.
LONDON, Jan. 20.â One of

calculation of the Boer losses
since the, beginning of' war.
It makes a total of 6425, of
which nearly a third is esti
mated to' have been ] incurred
in the siege of Ladysmith. The
British losses in killed, wound

correspondent gives an interest
ing calculation of the Boer losses
since the beginning of the war
and makes the total 6425, of
which nearly a third is estimated
to. have been, incurred in the
siege of Ladysmith.
The second ' detachment of the
city of London's Imperial Vol
unteers destined for the front left
early this morning. Better ar
rangements than last week were
made to protect the troops from
the excited crowd, and owing to
restrictions of the line of march
and the wretched weather sight
seers were much less numerous
than last Saturday, but the fervor
of the send-off was not less
strong.
MARLBOROUGH AND THE
VOLUNTEERS OFF FOR WAR
LONDON', Jan. 20.â The Duke of Marl
borough was up early this morning,
breakfasting in his bachelor flat in the
West End. All preparations for his de
parture for South Africa had been made,
and there was little to do but bundle hH
baggage into a cab for the railway sta
tion. The ducal captain was not at all
excited over the fact that there were
only a few hours more before he -uld
start for the front, and there was not tne
slightest trace of bravado In his voice
when he said enthusiastically that he
"was awfully anxious to get to the front."
His wish was not likely to be gratified
in the near future, as the yeomanry will
not be sent to the fighting lines until trey
have had a month -or so of special train
ing.
The report that the Duke of Marlbor
ough is taking an extended outfit to South
Africa and making preparations for a
picnic are quite unfounded. He had not
the slightest desire but to do the best he
can as a staff officer, and he does not
at all exaggerate his capabilities in this
respect. He does not take out with him
a number of mules, as has been asserted.
The only unusual part of his equipment
is a wagon or "spider," in which Lord
Randolph Churchill traveled . all over
South Africa and which the Duke of
Marlborough has placed at the service of
Lord Valencia, his immediate commander,
but to whom the courtesy is generally
appreciated, as a well seasoned "spider"
is one of the best means of transport.
The five horses the Duke of Marlborough
takes out will', likely enough, be much
needed as remounts before the Duke eees
Blenheim again, and if he does not use
them himself they will always bÂ« Â»t the
disposal of his brother officers. The Duke
of Marlborough's "retinue" consists of n
valet, who will probably be dispensed
with when the Duke leaves the ship. Once
in the field he contemplates taking so
more baggage than allowed in the c*.se
of any officer. He is greatly amusÂ«3 at
the stories regarding the Oriental Biyle
In which it has been asserted he will
travel. Probably the only articles outside
of the official kit which the Duke of Marl
borough will have with him when thÂ«>
yeomanry Is sent forward is an Ingenious
ly devised writing portfolio. Invented b>/
himself. The Duchess will not follow Mm
to the Cape.
The Duke Is much pleased at the ex
pressions of friendship for Great Britain
emanating from the United States, and is
seriously anxious to learn if such feelings
represent the majority of American opin
ion. From all appearances and from thÂ«
frankness of his conversation the Duke
of Marlborough has dropped his rank ani
is just an ordinary captain of yeomanry,
who is anxious to serve his. country and
to emulate as far as in him lies the
founder of his house.
About 11 o'clock the Duke and Duchess
of Marlborough drove to the "Waterloo
railroad station and made their way
through a crowd of khaki-clad officers
LONDON, Jan. 20. â From
dispatches which have been
received to-day it looks as
if the difficult and dangerous
operations projected by General
Buller are proceeding satisfac
torily. Lord Dundonald's activ
ity on the northwest is specially
useful in screening Warren's
movements from the Boers.
From Spearmans Camp to-day it
1 is learned that the firing of field
guns was heard early this morn
ing, which is understood to mean
that Warren has commenced to
bombard the Boer trenches on
Mount Tabanamuana. At the
same time it is believed that the
Boers have thrown almost their
entire force in Northern Natal
between General Buller and
Ladysmith camp.
A rumor says that the trenches
facing Colenso are completely
evacuated, the village having
been burned to the ground by a
force of Boers which crossed the
river with this object. But this
requires confirmation, of which
none is at hand at present.
k The Manchester Guardian's
correspondent gives currency to
a calculation that the total Boer
strength in Northern Natal is
not less than 48,000. If it is true
that the greater portion of this
force is concentrated between the
Tugela River and Ladysmith in
a line from Potgieters Drift Gen
eral Buller has clearly to meet an
adversary numerically his su
perior. It is considered improb
able, however, that the Boer
â¢ force is as strong as is stated.
It appears to be expected in
some quarters that Lord Dun
donald will push on with his cav
alry, ride around the left flank of
the Boers, cut their line of com
munication to Van Reenans Pass
and possibly enter Ladysmith. In
Warren's attack, which as al
k ready indicated is supposed to
have begun, there is plenty more
hard and adventurous work for
both man and horse.
The lull in both the southern
and western frontiers continues.
It would seem as if both sides
were alike conscious of the im
portant operations now being
carried on in Natal and were
resting on their weapons, wait
ing for the result of the conflict
upon which so much depends.
General Methuen is endeavor
ing to amuse his troops by a se
ries of cautious reconnoissances
to the right and left, but is affect
ing nothing beyond keeping his
i men employed.
The Boers are alert. Details
are furnished of the engagement
REPORTED BURNING OF COLENSO
Tr ONDON, Jan. 21.â The War Office shortly after midnight posted the following
H dispatch from General Buller dated Spearmans Camp, January 20, evening:
" "General Cleary. with a part of General Warren's' force, has been in
action from 6 a. m. till 7p. m. to-day. By a Judicious use of his artillery he has
fought his way up, capturing ridge after ridge for about three miles.
"The troops are now bivouacking on the ground he has gained, but the main
force is still in front of them.
*'The casualties were not heavy. About 100 wounded had been brought in
by 6:30 p. m. The number of killed has not yet been ascertained."
SPEARMANS CAMP, Jan. 20 (evening).â The Boer trenches were shelled con
tinually to-day. Genera! Lyttelton's brigade advanced and occupied a kopje
2000 yards from the Boer position at Brakfontein. A company of rifles ad
vanced with a balloon In action and were received with a heavy fire from the
Boers. The artillery and musketry fire continues from General Warren's posi
tion. The enemy had not shifted its position at the time this dispatch was
sent and the shells set fire to the grass. Lord Dundonald's force on Thursday
surprised 350 Boers. The British, who were posted on h kop|e, allowed the
Boers to advance leisurely before opening fire. The Boers did not reply and
a majority of them galloped off. It is reported that the remainder surrendered.

BOERS ARE MOST
THOROUGHLY PROVISIONED
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.â Exporters in this
city who make a specialty of the South
African trade believe that the Boers are
remarkably well provisioned and that any
attempt to starve them out is hardly
likely to succeed soon. The United States
la the source of the cereal supplies of the
lighting republics. As to canned meats
and jerked beef, practically all of the im
mense quantity consumed in South
Africa is supplied by American firms,
shipping through this port.
"The British Government has shown a
remarkable lack of foresight." remarked
one of the largest local food exporters
in South Africa to-day, "in forming a just
estimate of the preparedness of the Boers
for war; and the bad work of the intelli
gence department in gaining any accurate
information concerning their military
supplies is only one aspect of the case.
As a matter of fact the Boers have not
only been laying up an almost inexhaust
ible supply of powder and cartridges, but
an abundant supply of food as well. If
the British succeed in getting as far as
Pretoria or Johannesburg and attempt to
lay siege to the cities they will discover
that the inhabitants will suffer little from
the lack of food; that their granaries are
fairly bursting with the products of
American and Australian farms and that
in all the other food staples of war time,
such as camifd beef, the Dutch are plen
tifully provided.
"I base these conclusions upon an ex
amination of my own books. My firm
sends great quantities of flour and canned
goods to South Africa every year, and es
pecially, to Delagoa Bay. Port Natal, Dur
ban. East London and Port Elizabeth,
which are the chief ports of entry to the
Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I
never knew the South African trade to
be so brisk as it has been during the past
year, and especially the past few months
It was perfectly apparent that the Trans,
vaalers were ordering a great deal more
stuff than they could readily consume,
and the trade in that direction has for
some time been looked upon as abnor
mal."

CORNU CHARGED WITH
SHOOTING HIS DAUGHTER
Story That the Wound Was Inflicted
by a Tramp Is Discredited
by Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 20.â John Cornu. father
of four-year-old Lou Cornu, who was shot
through the thighs a couple of weeks ago
near Cupertino, was to-day arrested for
the act by Sheriff Langford, and he will
probably be charged with assault to mur
der. Great mystery has surrounded the
affair.
At first Cornu and hts children told a
story about a tramp shooting the girl.
The little son said that while ne and the
rest of the children were alone a tramp
called at the house and demanded food,
and when he was refused he drew a pis
tol and shot his sister. While the wound
was of a serious nature it is now nearly
healed. Sheriff Langford has learned that
Cornu has told certain parties that he
shot thÂ« girl accidentally. The bullet,
which was a 44-caliber, also fits the pistol
Cornu is known to have had. It is be
lieved that Cornu's fear of the conse
quences led him to concoct the tramp
story. If he confesses the matter will
probably be dropped, provided he can fur
nish proof of an accident.

SAMPSON PRAISED BY
BRITISH NAVAL EXPERT
Attacks Upon the American Admiral
Denounced as Unjust and
Cruel.
LONDON, Jan. 20.â 1n an account of the
Spanish-American naval campaign just
Issued W. 11. Wilson, a well-known naval
authority, writes: : â¢
"As an Englishman who will hardly be
accused of any political bias on American
affairs, I cannot refrain from expressing
surprise at the unjust and cruel attacks
which have been made by the American
press upon Admiral Sampson, or from ex
pressing admiration for the dignity, self
restraint and nobility of heart with which
he has borne himself under them."
Continuing, he says: "To Englishmen
his ceaseless vigilance, wise disposition,
accurate judgment and courage seem to
have deserved another recompense."
Throughout the book Mr. Wilson speaks
In the highest terms of the American
navy, retracting many criticisms which
appeared In his articles in American
magazines.

tary power of exclusion? Will It declare It
self defenseless and ridiculous?
Nor are those who assert that expulsion Is
the remedy necessarily barred from voting for
the resolution declaring the scat vacant. He
must Indeed, be technical and narrow In his
construction of the constitution who will not
admit that. If a vote to declare the seat vacant
is sustained by a two-thinls majority, the con
stitution is substantially complied with. He
may not agree with the committee that a mere
majority can exclude, but he can reserve the
right to make the point of order that the reso
lution is not carried it" two-thirds do not vote
for it.
If the House takes tho action which the
minority of the committee Insists It ought to
take, It will, for the first time in Its history,
part with a most beneficent power which it has
often exercisedâ a power that ought rarely to
be exercised, but which the House has never
declared It did not possess.
Mindful of the gravity of the question and
realizing the responsibility Imposed upon us,
we recommend the adoption of the following
resolution:
"Resolved, That under the facts and circum
stances of this caye, Brigham 11. Roberts,
Representative-elect from the State of Utah,
ought not to have or hold a seat In the House
of Representatives and the seat to which he
was elected is hereby declared vacant."
ROBERT W. TAYLER,
CHARLES B. LANDIS,
PAGE MORRIS.
SMITH MACPHERSON.
SAMUEL W. L. LANHAM,
â¢ROBERT W. MIERS.
The full report of the committee elab
orates the summaries, and in some parts
uses strong language against Roberts.
As to his plural marriages it says:
Prior to JSB2 It. H. Roberts had married one
Louisa Smith. She has borne him' six children
and is still living.
About ISS3, when Utah was fairly ringing
with the blows of the Edmunds act of ISSJ;
while numerous prosecutions were going on,
and after the Supremo Court had passed upon
the validity of the act; Â¦ when the â¢ American
people supposed that polygamy had received Its
deathblow; when no man of the many whose
cases went to the United States Supreme
Court pretended the provisions against polyga
mous marriages were invalidâ with all these
facts instantly before him, Urisham H. Rob
erts took another wifeâ his first polygamous
wife, Celia Dibble by name, who in the follow
ing twelve years bore him six children.
This second wife he married in defiance of
the Edmunds law. He spat upon the law; he
declared by his act that he recognized no bind
ing rule upon him of a law of Congress. The
Congress of tho United States was to him an
object of contempt. The Supreme Court of the
United States might declare the law for others,
but not for him. He laughed at its futile de
crees and spurned its admonitions. The execu
tive which had declared in solemn messages its
gratification that polygamy seemed gone forever
he defied and despised. Ot what consequence
to him were laws of Congress and declarations,
of the highest court and proclamations of the
President, In his sensual interpretation of a
sensual doctrine?
And all the time the Edmunds law declared
not only polygamy but cohabitation with more
than one woman unlawful. Roberts not only
blgamously married a second wife, but he per
sisted In violating and defiantly trampling un
der foot every other provision of the act.
But he had not yet sufficiently proclaimed his
utter contempt for the Supreme Court, for Con
gress ar.d its most solemn enactments. A few
years later he took a third wife.
From the time of his second marriage to the
third he cohabited with two women. From the
<*ate of his third marriage down to his elec
tion, and, we doubt not, to the present time,
he has been cohabiting with three women.
A% recently as December 6, 1599, he defined
his position as follows:
"These \vÂ»men have stood by me. They arÂ«
pood and true women. The law has said I shall
part from them. My church has bowed to tha
command of Congress and relinquished the
practice of plural marriages. But the law can
not free me from obligations assumed before it
spoke. No power can do that. Even were the
church that sanctioned these marriages and
performed the ceremonies to turn its back upon
us and say the marriages are not valid now
and that 1 must give these good and loyal
women up. I'll be damned If I would." Â¦
In this statement he adheres to the audacious
assumption that the law of ISB2 did not speak
to him and that he did not recognise It ajÂ»
a rule of conduct to him. We assert before the
House, the country and history that It Is ab
solutely and imDregnably sound, not to be
effectively attacked, consonant with every leg
islative precedent. In harmony with the law
and with the text books on the subject.
Brigham 11. Roberts' persistent, notorlouÂ»
and defiant violation of one of the most sol
emn acts ever passed by Congress, by the very
body which he seeks now to enter, on the
theory that he is above the law, and his de
fiant violations of the laws of his own State,
necessarily render him ineligible, disqualified,
unfit and unworthy to be a member of the
House of Representatives. And this proposi
tion is asserted not so much for reasons per
sonal to the membership of the House as be
cause it goes to the very Integrity of the House
and the republic as such.
The minority report says
The undersigned members of the special
committee appointed to investigate and report
on the prima facie and final right of Brigham
H. Roberts to a Beat In the House as the Rep
resentative from Utah, being unable to agree
with the conclusions of the committee as v
the constitutional questions Involved, very re
spectfully submit our views.
Assuming that Mr. Roberts had been and
1b now a polygamlst, unlawfully cohabiting
with plural wives, and that the House of Rep
resentatives Is for that reason of the opinion
that he ought not to be a member thereof,
what course should It rightfully pursue under
the constitution, the supreme law of the land
exclude him. or expel him? If he is to be ex
cluded It must be because he is for such rea
son legally Ineligible or disqualified. The pur
pose is to consider the question of constitu
tional right, not of power, as It is conceded
that the House has the power to exclude, with
or without reason, right or wrong. The exer-
else of such a, power without constitutional
warrant would simply be brute force, a tyran
nous exercise of power unrevjewabla by any
tribunal, .i.
After citing the constitutional provision
as to the qualifications of a Representa
tive in Congress the report proceeds:
Is It seriously contended that this House can
of Its own motion, by its own Independent ac
tion, create for the purposes of this case a
legal disqualification? This House alone can
not make or unmake the law of the land. It
is quite clear that the House by its Independ
ent action cannot If It would make for this
case any disqualifying regulations that would
have the force of law.
.The report then extensively reviews the
law and precedents bearing on the case.
I he mai.n heads are as follows;
Firstâ lt Is a grave question as to whether
Congress can by a law duly enacted add to
the qualifications negatively stated In the con
stitution. There Is no decision of the United
States Supreme Court directly or indirectly
construing this provision. There Is no decision
of any State court directly In point.
Secondâ lf the right to decide a disqualifica
tion. b>- law is assumed,- the disqualification
imposed by the Edmunds act does not apply
to a member of Congress, and therefore does
n<st affect Mr. Roberts. The only portion of the
section that can be said to have any applica
tion to a member of the House of Representa
tives Is that which declares that no polygamigt.
etc., shall he . entitled to hold any ottlce or
place of public trust, honor, or emolument un
der the United States. Unless a member of
the House holds an office "under the United
Slates", within the meaning of the constitution
ar.d the law there is no disqualification.
Continuing, the report says:
This House, by its independent action, can
not make law for any purpose. The adding by
Hi;* House, acting alone, of a qualification not
established by law would not only be a viola
tion of the constitution and the law. but It
would establish a most dangerous precedent,
which could hardly fail to return to plaguo
the inventor.
You might feel that the grave moral and so
cial aspects of this case allowed you to â
"Wrest once the law to your authority.
To do a great right, do a little wrong."
But what warrant have you, when the har
riers of the constitution are once broken down,
that there may not come after us a House with
other standards of morality ami propriety,
which will create other qualifications with no
rightful. foundation, that, in the heat and un
reason of partisan contestâ since there will be
no definite standard by which to determine the
existence of qualificationsâ will add any
thing that may be necessary to accomplish
the desired result? Exigency will determine
the sufficiency. It would no longer be a gov
ernment of laws, but of men. To thus depart
from the constitution and substitute force for
law is to embark upon a trackless sea, with
out chart or compass, with llmost a certainty
of direful shipwreck.
The report concludes as follows
A small partisan majority might render the
desire to arbitrarily exclude by a majority
vote In order to more securely Intrench itself
In power irresistible. Hence Its exercise is
controlled by legal rules. In case of expulsion,
when the requisite two-thirds can be had, the
motive for the exercise of arbitrary power no
longer exists, as a two-thirds partisan major
ity is sufficient for every purpose. Hence ex
pulsion has been safely left in the discretion
of the House and the safety of the members
does not need the protection of legal rules.
It seems to us settled upon reason and au
thority that the power of the House to expel
Is unlimited and that the legal propositions in
volved may be thus fairly summarized:
The power of exclusion Is a matter of law,
to be exercised by a majority vote. In accord
ance with legal principles, and exists only
where a member-elect lacks some of the quali
fications required by the constitution. The
power of expulsion Is made by the constitution
purely a matter of discretfon, to be exercised
by a two-thirds vote, fairly. Intelligently, con
scientiously, with a due regard to propriety
and the honor and integrity of the House, and
the rights of the individual member. For the
abuse of this discretion we are responsible only
to our constituents, our consciences and our
God. Â¦'-'* ..;Â¦â¢Â¦
We believe that Mr. Roberts has the legal
constitutional right to be sworn in as a mem
ber, but the facts are such that we further
believe the House, In the exercise of Its dis
cretion, is not only justified but required by
every proper consideration Involved to expel
him promptly after he becomes a member.
We recommend the following as & substitute
for the resolution proposed by the committee:
â¢"Resolved, That Brigham H. Roberts, hav
ing been duly elected a Representative In the
Fifty-sixth Congress from the State of Utah,
with the qualifications requisite for admission
to the House as such, is entitled by constitu
tional right to take the oath of office pre
scribed for members-elect, his status as a
polygamlst, unlawfully cohabiting with plural
wives, affording constitutional ground for ex
pulsion, but not for exclusion from the House."
And If the House shall hold with us and
swear In Mr. Roberts asa member we shall, as
Boon as recognition can be had. offer a resolu
tion to expel him as a polygamlst, unlawfully
cohabiting with plural wives.

When the House met to-day Tayler of
Ohio, chairman of the special committee
to investigate the case of Representative
elect B. H. Roberts, presented the ma
jority report in favor of the exclusion of
Roberts, and gave notice that he would
call the case up on Tuesday. IJttletleld
of Maine presented the minority report
in favor Of seating Roberts and then ex
pelling him. The minority report was
signed by Littlefleld (R.) and De Armond
Five thousand copies of the reports were
ordered printed for general distribution.
Roberts was In his seat during these pro
ceedings, but made no effort to address
the House.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â Reports of the
special committee of investigation in the
case of Brigham H. Roberts of Utah were
presented to the House to-day. The ma
jority report, signed by Chairman Tayler
and six of his associates. Is a voluminous
document and is accompanied by a sum
mary of the law and facts. It gives the
details of the hearings, the ample oppor
tunities afforded to Mr. Roberts to pre
sent his case, his refusal to testify and the
unanimous finding of facts, heretofore
published. It proceeds:
The committee is unanimous In the belief that
Mr. Roberts ought not to remain v. member Â»f
the House of Representatives. A majority is of
the opinion that he ought not to be permitted
to btcome a member: that the House has the
light lv exclude him. A minority Is of the
opinion that the proper course of procedure Is
to permit him to be sworn in and then to ex
pel him by a two-thirds vote under the con
stitutional provision providing for expulsion.
Your committee desires to assert with the
utmost positiveness at this point that not only
Is the proposition of expulsion as applied to this
case aKÃinst precedent, but that exclusion is
entirely in accord with principle, authority and
legislative precedent and not antagonistic to
any legislative action which the House of
Representatives has ever taken.
For convenience we present herewith, before
proceeding to extended argument in support of
the committee's resolution, the following sum
mary:
Upon the facts stated the majority of the
committee asserts that the claimant ought not
to be permitted to take a seat In the House of
Representatives and that the seat to which he
was elected ought to be declared vacant.
The minority on the other hand asserts that
he ought to be sworn in in order that, if hap
pily a two-thirds vote therefor be obtained, he
may be expelled.
Three distinct grounds of disqualification are
asserted acalnst Mr. Roberts:
1. By reason of his violation of the Edmunds
law.
2. By reason of his notorious and defiant vio
lation of the law of the land, of the decisions
of the Supreme Court and of the proclamations
of the Presidents, holding himself above the law
and not untenable to it.
No government could possibly exist In the
face of such practices. He Is In open war
against the laws-arid institutions of the coun
try, whose Congress he seeks to enter. Such
an idea is Intolerable. It Is upon the principle
asserted in this ground that all cases or ex
clusion have been based.
3. His election as Representative Is an ex
plicit end offensive violation of the understand
ing by which Utah was admitted as a State.
The objection Is made to the refusal to admit
Roberts that the constitution excludes the idea
that any objection can be made to his coming in
if he is 25 years old. If he has been seven years
a citizen of the United States and was an in
habitant of Utah when elected, no matter how
odious or treasonable or criminal may have
been his life and practices. To this We reply:
1. That the language of the constitutional
provision, the history of Its framing in the con
stitutional convention and its context clearly
show that It cannot be construed to prevent dis
qualification for crime.
2. That the overwhelming authority of text
book writers on the constitution Is to the effect
that such disqualification may be imposed by
the House, and no commentator on the consti
tution specifically denies It.
3. The courts of several of the States In con
struing analogous provisions have with prac
tical unanimity declared against such a nar
row construction of such constitutional pro
visions.
4. The House of Representatives has never
denied that it had the right to exclude a mem
ber-elect, even when he possessed the three
constitutional provisions.
5. In many Instances It has distinctly as
rerted its rights so to do in cases of disloyalty
End crime.
6. It passed In ISC2 the test oath act. which
Imposed a real and substantial disqualification
for membership in Congress, disqualifying hun
dreds of thousands of American citizens. This
law remained in force for twenty years, and
thousands of members of Congress were com
pelled to take the oath It required.
7. The House In IS6J adopted a general rule
of order, providing that no person should be
sworn In as a member acalnst whom the ob
jection was made that- he was not entitled to
take the test oath, and if. on Investigation,
fuch fact appeared he was to be permanently
debarred from entrance.
8. The interesting proposition Is made that
the claimant be sworn in and then turned out.
I'ppn the theory that the purpose is to per
manently part company with Koberts. this. ls
a dubious proceeding. Such action requires
the vote of two-thirds of the members. We
ask If such a vote Is possible or right. In view
of the following observations:
The expulsion clause of the constitution Is
as follows:
"Each House may determine the rules of
Its proceedings, punish Its members for dis
orderly behavior and, with the concurrence ot
two-thirds, expel a member."
No lawyer can read that provision without
raising in his own mind the question whether
the House has any power to expel, except for
some raure relating: to the context. The ablest
lawyers from the beginning of the republic
have so Insisted, and their reasoning has been
so cogent that these propositions are estab
lished, namely:
I. Neither House of Congress has ever ex
pelled h member for acts unrelated to him as
a member or inconsistent with his public duty
as such.
2. Both Houses have many times refused to
expel where the guilt of the member was ap
parent, where the refusal to expel was put
upon the ground that the House or Senate, as
the case might be. had no riirht to expel for
an act unrelated to the member as such, or
because It was committed prior to his election.
The report concludes as follows
If there is any fact apparent in this case.
It Is that the constituents of Mr. Roberts knew
all about him before his election. Can there
he room to doubt the proper action of the
House? Is it prepared to yield up this salu-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 21, 1900.
AUTHORIZED BY CLARK
TO PURCHASE A VOTE
Witness Says He Was Told to Pay Ten
Thousand Dollars to a Member of
the Montana Legislature.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â The lnvestiga- |
tion by the Committee on Elections and
Privileges Into the allegations of bribery
against Senator Clark was resumed to
day. T. F. Norrnolle. a bookkeeper of
Butte, was first called. He was a mem
ber of the last Legislature. He testified
that within a week after his election he
was approached with an indirect offer of
a large sum for his vote for Clark. It
was said to him that he could get from
$15,000 to $20,000 for his vote and perhaps
enough to make him a snug fortune if he
would merely absent himself from the
Legislature at the time of the voting for
United States Senator. When the Legis
lature convened a man had approached
him and asked him. lf he propseU to make
a "sucker" of himself and not get any
thing out of the election. Finally, he said.
Just before the election, he was offered
Â»12,500 for his vote for Clark, the sum to
ba placed in the hands of some disinter
ested person.
At tnis point Chairman Chandler said
that John f. Murphy of Butte. one of the
men who. it is claimed, had approached
Normoile, had come to Washington by re
quest to testify in the case. He left im
mediately after a subpena had been issued
for him.
"Search has been made for him in vain."
said "Senator Chandler, "and the assist
ance of the newspapers is solicited to as
certain his whereabouts."
In response to a statement from Faulk
ner. Clark's leading attorney, that he
knew nothing of Murphy, Senator Chan
dler replied:
"1 thought he might accidentally let you
know his whereabouts."
Faulknerâ l'll let you know if he does.
Chandlerâ No doubt the newspaper men
will find him in two or three days.
On cross-examination Normoile said he
was a Democrat. He was employed and
had been since the Legislature adjourned,
by the Anaconda Company. He voted for
Conrad for United States Senator from
first to last. He said that to the proposi
tion of 512.000 for his vote, he had said
that he would think it over. As to the
$10,000 proposition he had replied. "That
is very little for a man to sell himself
for."
At the conclusion of Normoile's testi
mony Cason. one of yesterdays witnessed,
was recalled for cross-examination by
Faulkner. He admitted that he had gone
to W. A. Clark's office in November, soon
after the election, to talk with him about
the election of a United States Senator.
He explained why he had gone to see
Clark, saying that generally the Repub
licans were favorable to Clark and that
he thought there was a chance to elect
him. In the interviews he had with Clark
in November he had indicated his beliet
that Marcyes. Representative-elect from
Custer County, might be induced to vote
for Clark, but that he said no approach
to corruption with reference to Marcyes
was made at these interviews.
Cason then was examined as to an in-
terview with W. A. Clark, held in the lat
ter's room just before the election of So:>
ator. He declared that Clark had asked
him to see Representative Mareyea. zs
the. witness could handle him better than
any one else. Cason said Clark na>l
authorized him to pay $10.fW to Repre
sentative Marcyes. the authorization be
ing given him in a whisper and by hold
ing up thp fingers and thumbs of rv.tn
hands. Subsequently he had learned that
Marcyes was favorable to Clark anyhow,
and he made no offer of money to him.
Cason. aftt-r admitting that he received
S5OO from Senator Clark for his icnrtcea,
paid that Clark did not have the reputa
tion In Butte of being a liberal payer.
In response to an inriuiry of Faulkner
as to how many written statements he
bad m;ule concerning this rase. I'asnn
replied that he had made one to liooth.
an attorney of Butte. a Daly Democrat,
and the one to which he had testified to
yesterday. In conversation with Booth he
he had told him some time last summer
that he did not want to testify in th^
case. Subsequently he had given Booth
a written statement, accompanied by the
letters hearing upon the case. He denie<l
receiving any consideration f^r the Â¦writ
ten statement beyond the promise that
he would not be called as a witness. He
added that he knew the statement could
not be used as evidence. He said that,
in his opinion, the matter contained in the
two statements was "too good to keep."
and that he had been betrayed by both
Booth and Root. Ho denied having re
ceived any consideration for the testi
mony which he delivered in the Wellcome
disbarment proceedings.
A letter of Cason to Root, in which the
former held the latter responsible for
making public his written statement.
which was to be held as sacred between
them, was offered in evidence. In th~ let
ter Cason declared his Intention of mak
ing a clean breast of the whole trans:ic
tlon, and accused Root of violating bis
rath as an Odd Fellow in betraying him
(Cason).
In another letter Cason reiterated the
statements made in the Root letter, de
claring that Clark had said he would hoM
his seat in the Senate if it cost him $I.â¢**>.
000. On redirect examination <'ason tola
how Root had given him $1500 to leave
Butte and keep away from the service or
a subpena of the State committee.
At the conclusion of the examination
of Cason counsel for the contestants an
nounced that they had no other testi
mony to offer until certain letters sent for
by the flefer.se had arrived. Faulkr.er s:il<t
the letters, although on the way froÂ»n
Butte. had not arrived.
In response to an inquiry from Chair
mar. Chandler as to whether or not be

Merritt Will Com

WASHINGTON*. Jan. 30. -According to
arrangements already made by the War
Department the remains of Major Gen
eral Henry W. Lawton. U. S. V.. who
killed at San Matto. Luzon, December 12
last, will be interred in the National
Cemetery with full military honors the
day after they reach this city.
Previous to the interment the troops to
compose the funeral escort, which will
consist of one regiment of Infantry, one
regiment of foot artillery, a squadron of
cavalry and two mounted batteries of ar
tillery, will be assembled in the city to
escort the remains from the church where
the funeral religious services are to be
held t<> the cemetery.
Major General Wesley Merritt, com
manding th*> Department of the East, has
been charged %ith the execution of these
orders. General Merritt has been formal
Â»>' opslgrnated to command the escort.
The remains of General Lawton are on
tne troopsnip Thomas and are expected
to arrive at San Francisco about .Febru
ary l. Mrs. Lawton is a passenger on
that vessel, and the final arrangements
for the funeral will not be made until the
authorities at Washington have ascer
tained her wishes. It is settled, however,
that the body will be brought to Wash
ington on a special train in charge of
Major General Shafter, who will be ac
companied by an aid. The itinerary of
THE struggle for the Turf Congress
stakes, decided at Tanforan Park
yesterday, was one that will be re
membered in California turf his-
Tory for years to come. Five
thousand excited spectators saw Ban
nockburn, the mighty brown son of Hay
den Edwards, lower the coast record of
l:3?Vi. made by Vinctor in IS3S, to 1:39 fiat.
Xot only this, but he caused Geyser, the
pet and pride of the Corrigan stable, to
strike his colors and acknowledge defeat.
From every standpoint the performance
of Bannockburn excels any other ever
run at the distance in this country.
When Libertine made his world's record
of 1.3? s i at Chicago in 1594 he carried but
ninety pounds, while in yesterday's race
the winner under the conditions of the
stake, picked up his entitled weights, 124
pounds.
So great was the interest displayed In
th* big event that little attention was
paid by the crowd to the first three para

the winner would have to step below l:3y
to beat Bannockburn. still his price went
from 3 to 4. The Shields duo, Zoroaster
and Advance Guard, came in for steady
support, but Bendoran and his stable
mate, the dainty Flush of Gold, were only
nibbled at. Yellowtail warmed up so well
that he caught the fancy of many an on
looker. Olinthus was the outsider.
At the post little time was consumed,
Caldwell releasing the barrier to a very
good start. Almost at the commencement
Vittltoc, on Sardine, was cut off and
Spencer, astride Geyser, managed to get
bumped a bit later. As predicted, Jones
went for the lead with Yellowtail. fol
lowed by Bendoran, the pair rattling off
the first half in :4S*{.. Bullman had hus
tled Bannockburn up from behind, at this
stage laying third. Bendoran snapped
first and as the stretch was reached Ban
nockburn had dethroned Yellowtail as
leader, while Spencer, gliding along next
the rail with Geyser, showed in third po
sition, watches clicking the six furlongs
in 1:13%: Then ensued a memorable drive
to the wire. Turning for a second in the
saddle a furlong from the stand Bullman
saw a flash of green and realized that the
critical time had arrived. Digging his
heels into the sides of the brown horse
he forged ahead, and at the paddock "Ice
man" Spencer "pulled his bat" on Geyser.
Then the frenzied crowd began shouting
"Bannockburn! Bannockburn!" and amid
a mighty roar, the echo of which could be
heard in the peaceful foothills, the Schrei-
ing, and that was the start in the final
event. Corrigan's Maxello, carrying a
heavy commission, got away "lengths
ahead of his field, to about the worst start
ever seen on the local course.
Driving furiously at the closp, Schreib

Starting a 9 to 10 chance, Scotch Plaid

a bid for the purse, beating Red Pirate

It was not a pleasant reception Mr
Caldwell received as he returned to the
stand after dispatching tlie last field. He
allowed Corrigan's Maxello to slip away
by himself, with most of the others
standing at the post. The crowd dis
played its displeasure by hoots and
jeers. The start should have been pro
tested, as Caldwell did not release the
barrier, and under the "no recall" sys
tem it would be interesting to many to
know what really constitutes a start.
Other people besides Corrigan bet their
money, and even if they are "Native

Strange Action of Walter
Laidler.
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING
PROS ABLY ANOTHER WOMAN IN
THE CASE.
Claimed to Have a Splendid Home
in California and Disappeared
on the Eve of Departure
for It.
Special Dlsnatch to The Ca
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.â Search is being
made for Walter R. Laidler of England
and California, who. after bringing his
wife to this country last Wednesday,
strangely disappeared. He had, shortly
after his marriage in England ten years
ago started to tind his fortune in the
United States. His wife remained in Eng
land and maintained herself on money
which her husband sent her at regular in
tervals.
Three years ago he sent word that he
had at last won In his hard fight for a
competence, and then wrote that he had
lost all his worldly wealth and had to be
gin life over again. He wrote last No
vember to his wife in England that he had
a splendid home for her In California, of
which he forwarded photographs, and two
days after the letter reached England he
came in person. According to me story
told by Mrs. Laidler. her husband had
plenty of money, for he distributed
twenty-dollar gold pieces to her relatives.
They left England on the White Star
liner Oceanic and arrived here last
Wednesday. They went to Smith & Mc-
Neil's Hotel. It had been arranged that
they should spend a week in New York
before departing for their home in Cali
fornia. Mr. Luirller went to the general
postoffice on the day of their arrival,
where he got a bundle of letters. Mrs.
Laidler noticed as they sat at dinner in a
Broadway restaurant shortly afterward
that several of the letters were addressed
in delicate feminine handwriting. She
says that when he reached the third letter
he seemed to be much perturbed.
"What a correspondence." exclaimed
his better half. "From a woman, too:
she must have much to say."
Mrs. Laidler intended this to be merely
a playful reference. She says that hv'V
husband turned white and that his hand
trembled.
They returned to thplr hotel after din
ner. Her husband had a large sum of
money with him, and he asked her to
take some of It. She replied that she
would take some money when she bettc-r
understood the use of American currency
He then went out to see about his bag
gage. He did not return Wednesday
nfght, and Mrs. Laidler paced the hotel
room in a frenzy of excitement. Seabrook
Waddell, cashier of the restaurant, heard
of the misfortune of the woman, and he
took her to his own home in Greenvilie.
N. J. He will notify the police and use
every effort to get a trace of the missing
man.
Inquiry at the White Star pier revealed
the fact that a man answering the de
scription of Mr. Laldlcr. although it
mfght not have been he, got a trunk and
a valise Friday and had them transferred
He gave the name of Brown and markea
the luggage for a town in New Jersey on

He seemed much agitnted and spoke of
meeting a friend at the Barclay street

band never exchanged words in anger.

FORT BCOTT. Kans.. Jan. 20.â George
Eilbee a:*'i IM Merks. half brothers, who
were convicted of murder here earlier in
the Â¦Â»â¢><-!,. â¢wore lynched by a mob In tho
county jail yard to-night. At a late hour
their bodies wem dangling from two trees
In the yard, the authorities having been
f-o completely surprised that no effort had
been made to remove the grastly evl-
of t!^e mob's work.
The two men. who hailed from Kansas
City, had bct:i convicted of murder in the
:irst dtu,nc. Their victim was a young
German farmer named L<eopold Kdlinger,
Â¦whose murder occurred near this city In
October last. The murderers told Ed
lir.gcrs r-iir of mules, one horse and a
â¢wagon in </. tiar County. Amos Phiiipps,
tn accomplice of the two brothers, was
convicted yesterday of murder in the first
degree. The evidence showed that the
three mo:Â» belonged to a gang of thieves
Â¦who had bven regularly disposing of their
plunder in Cedar County.
The lynching \v;i-Â« the work of a mob
that began gathering in the vicinity of
tr.Â«= county jaii soon after dark, but the
purpose of the- gathering seems not to
rave been suspected until the jail was
attacked. A barbed wire trocha that had
bt-tn previously built around the jail was
borne dowr:. the heavy dewrs leading to
the prison were battered in, and when the
mob cajne bowling out of the jaij with its
intended victims the interior of the place
looked as if It had been wrecked by Uy-
Jiamite.
Oeorge Siibee, the older of the two
brothers. Â«lefK-d his captors until the last.
He placed the noose around his own neck
and died cursing the crowd. Just as he
craa jerked Into eternity he turned to his
brother with an oath and commanded him
to "die Ramo." The brother obeyed,
n;a;ntair.ing an outward calm until he was
hauled into the air.
K-fore this tjilbev had shouted to the
ir.ob in defiant tones that he himself shot
Kdlinger and that Amos Philipps struck
l.m on thÂ«- liead with an ax. lie insisted
lirat his broihcr K<i did not participate
::i the crime.
Â¦;Â¦.Â¦ n;ri- and get Philipps," the doomed
man urged. Then, shouting to his tor
menior*. he bade them, witn a curse, to
faring him up. His hatred for the accom
plice. Philipps, was probably due to the
Tact that PriilipT/s. soon after his arrest,
made, a full cuntession of the crime,
though when he was put upon trial he re
pudiated this earlier confession.
i-'.i Meeka w;is equally fearless in the
hand? of the mob. but he did not manifest
the spirit of bravado thown by his broth
er, riis last words were: "Hang me if
you will, but 1 did not help kill Ldlinger.

The doomea mm. got no farther in his
Matement. tor tour or live men had him
by the fett. others drew the noose around
his neck, throwing the loose end over a
iirab. and in a moment he was strangling
to death.
When finally satisfied with their venge
iir.ee upon the iÂ»u brothers, the loaders
Â».f the mob went back to the jail In search
of old man Philipps. In the meantime the
jailkeepers had secreted him in a room
in ihr- rear of the structure and when the
lyncbers came hack they were told that
HhUlpps hud b^cn hurried away. After a
brfel search the lynchera seemed satis-
Sed with this explanation and left thÂ»
Focne. thus sparing the life of the third
murderer. Philippe probably will be taken
out of the city. There is some question
is to the old man's sanity.
The direct cause of the lynching was a
vicious attack by Silbee and Meeks upon
Deputy Sheriff Bchmer. when the latter
v.ent bo their cell to-night to inspect the
cap*. Behmer then discovered that the
convicts had sawed the hinges of the cell
door all but off. He entered the cage
to remove the prisoners to another cell,
and as he did so was felled by Silb*Â»e with
an Iron bar which the prisoners had se
<*r< > ted. Other deputies came to Behmer's
r^P'-ue, and In the scrimmage fired several
shots at the convicts. One bullet took
? ff*-ct In Silbee's leg.
This thooUng attracted a crowd. Wild
Ftorl^s of Iho assault were soon In circu

around the jail and It required only the
few leaders who rame later to incite the
gathering to violence.
After the assault upon Deputy B^hmer.

DATA FOR. THE CENSUS.
How Manufacturing Statistics Are to
Be Gathered.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â An official
statement has been issued by the Cen
sus Office with reference to the Industrial
census. It is as follows:
The census act provides that the statistics
of manufactures may be collected by enumera
tors or by special agent?, at the discretion of
the director. He may designate certain cities
towns or other manufacturing centers In which
the manufacturing shall be withheld from the
enumerators and placed in the hands of special
agents. A list of such cities and towns has
been prepared, numbering in the aggregate over
1000, and a careful estimate shows that all of
the manufacturing establishments Included in
the localities to be withdrawn from the enumer
ators can be visited and returns from them se
cured within the brief space of thirty days
by the employment of 2000 special agents who
will be paid by the day. The compensation
which it is proposed to allow them is $4 per
day, except In special cases, but it can In no
instance exceed IS.
In the collection of manufacturing statistics
the director proposes to utilize as far as possi
ble the organization created for the general
enumeration by placing the supervisor of cpii
bus of the proper district in charge, by group
ing the localities withdrawn, and by empow
ering the best of the enumerators for an addi
tional month as special agents.

LITTLE DANGER HERE
FROM BUBONIC PLAGUE
1 Dr. Wyman Says That Even Were It
Introduced It Could Be Stamped
Out in a Short Time.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 20.â An Interesting
s=:id valuable brochure giving a complete !
history of the bubonic plague, together
vith means which have been adopted for
i:s prevention, has been prepared and j
made public by Surgeon General Wyman j
of the Marine Hospital service.
The opinion is expressed that in the j
light of experience in other parts of the i
xvcrid It teems reasonable to believe that :
even were the disc-ase introduced here its i
*;pread would be very limited in cities j
where the sanitary conditions are good j
er.d where precautions Â«is to the isolation Â¦
at patients and segregation of those px- I
l>oÂ«ed to infection could be practiced. ThÂ«> â¢'
rfÂ«-ath rate varies in different epidemics |
and is ostimatfd at from M to V) per cent.
There is a variation also according to !
nationalities. Chinese seemingly being the j
most susceptible.
Dr. "YVyman expresses the opinion that i
the quarantine methods of the United !
States h.Tr well adapted to the emergen- I
cics, though the national laws should be Â¦
vtrengthoiK-d. In a letter submitting the ;
matter to the Secretary of the Treasury '
he says:
"It should not be forgotten that the i
epidemic is surely though slowly extended I
and for the tirst time in history it has !
Invaded the Western Hemisphere.
â¢"The necessity therefore of especial vig
ilance has been and is still being im
pressed upon quarantine officers by the
burea.u. and of the utmost importance is
the provision â¢which should be made by
municipalities, especially those on the
seaboard, to correct immediately unsani
tary conditions, which are now wÂ«ll
known to favor the propagation of Infec
tioo. disease,.-
the train will not be determined until the
wishes of Mrs. Lawton are known. It is

Sacred Soil of the Links Disturbed by
the Profane Paws of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL., Jan. 20.â The "hoot
mons" of this place are seriously consid
ering the question of leaving their cad
dies and clubs to their own sweet wills
for a day or two and organizing a coyote
hunt*
The troubles of these exclusive "hoot
mons" seem as though they would never
cease. First Butcher Klein's slaughter
hous-e assailed their delicate olfactory
nerve?, and now coyotes have dared to
swoop down on these sacred grounds and
dig holes with profane paws in the sa

Yesterday morning the smooth, green
extent of the San Rafael Golf Club's links
was marred in several places by large
irregular holes. The cluh called a special
rm-eting to considfr what human being or
animal had presumed to brave the "No
trespassing" notices and scratch up the
links which were only won after much
bitter litigation. An intelligent caddie
handed down the opinion that a coyote
was the depredator and accordingly the
club will shortly doi^ their vociferous
plaids and in scarlet coats chase the wolf

WALSH TAKES UP THE
WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
LIVELY FIGHT PUT UP BY A
LEGLESS MENDICANT.
How the Pride of the Califor
nia-Street Station Picked
Up More Than He
Could Handle.
Officer Thomas Walsh, the Adonis nf
the California street station. Is a some
â¢what d!ftigriir^d beauty to-day. His face
looks as though it had run against a com
bination pile-driver and threshing ma
chine Â«md got the worst of the encoun

Tommy has one 6trlp of courtplaster
on his cheek that covers a wound fully
five inches Ion?, while on the other por
tions of his ar.atomy are lumps and ridges
that make him like an Intrenched Boer
position in the Transvaal.
The reason of all this is the philan
thropy which urged Walsh yesterday to
assume the white man's burden and the
unwillingness of that burden to be as-
Burned without something in the shape of
a protest.
The burden took the shape of a legless

TEMPORARY TARIFF
PREPARED FOR GUAM
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â The Navy De
partment has prepared a tariff for the
island of Guam based on the schedules
now in use for the islands of Cuba and
Porto Rico. It was the intention to adopt
the Philippine schedules for the little
Island, but It was found they were only
slight modifications of the tariff which
existed before the archipelago came into
the possession of the United States and
so were unsuitable because of the heavy
discrimination ln favor of Spain. It is
thought that the tariff as prepared for
Guam will be adopted for the island of
Tutuila. It is understood that these
measures are only temporary and will pre
vail only ln the absence of some direction
by Congress.
HOSPITAL CORPS MEN
FOR THE PHILIPPINES
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â The War De
partment has arranged to send 150 hos
pital corps men to the Philippines on the

from San Francisco some time next month.
To secure this number of men It will be
necessary to withdraw recruits from in
struction at either the Washington bar
racks or Angel Island. Acting Hospital
Steward Cleveland Hitson Jr. and forty
one privates of the hospital corps now at
the Washington barracks will start for
San Francisco in a few days.

CONFESSED THAT SHE
MURDERED HER MOTHER
SIOUX FALLS, S. D., Jan. 20.âInforma
tion has reached here that Mrs. Van
Hcrne. who recently died in the State of
Washington, confessed on her deathbed
that she murdered her mother, Mrs.
Thomas Egan, near this city September
12. ISSO. For this crime Thomas Egan, the
woman's husband, was hanged, although
to the last protesting his innocence. Mrs.
Van Home was his stepdaughter. Egan's
clothes were found in the barn covered
with blood, and this caused his convic
tion. The physicians at the hospital
where Mrs. van Home died took down
her conft-bsion and sent it to Egan's rela
tives here.
BLUSHING A DISEASE.
French Savant Says It Is , Due to
EreuthophoMa or Erythxo
phobia.
The general idea that blushing Is due
to fullness of blood in the brain is incor
rect, according to the new theory of a
French expert. It arises from the relaxa
tion of the arteries of the face, neck and
breast, thus allowing an extra quantity
of blood to rush to the skin. Those arte
ries have in their walls a layer of rings
of muscular fiber, which contract or re
lax according to the condition of the pa
tient, and bo permit the arteries to be
come more or less full of blood. When
they are extra full, which occurs in weak
ness, the patient blushes. ' '*
Blushers are more liable to redden in
damp or stormy weather than ln the cold
days of winter or the hot days of sum
mer. If this glowing of the face were tMo
result of emotion, why this difference? If
It be due to weakness the fact assumes
the appearance of probability.
There are two closely allied causes of
blushing. One is named "ereuthophobla";
that Is the ordinary causeâ weakness and
the extreme sensitiveness and other con
ditions caused by it. The other is desig
nated "erythophobia," and is the fear that
one will blush unconsciously at awkward
moments.
The latter is a peculiar form of the dis
ease. The individual ln question, although
not given to blushing, becomes gradually
possessed with a fear that he will do so
at some inopportune time, and this fear
grows upon him until it completely mas
ters him and makes him grow red ln the
face when there is not the slightest rea
son for it. '
At the most simple question the color
rises and ho is placed ln the most absurd
situation. He Is looked upon with sus
picion, because other people accept hia
confusion as consciousness of guilt; he
recognizes the fact, and of course his con
dition grows worse. Weakness is respon
sible in this case also for the deplorable
state of things, for when the sufferer is
taken in hand and gets "braced up" he
smiles at his former fears.
It must be' a very strong emotion that
causes a flush to come to the face of a
really healthy man or woman. Whatever
they may fpel, they will not show it any
more than they will show fear when con
fronted by great danger. In the latter
case there is no doubt about the danger;
it is fully understood that there may be a
feeling of fear within, but it is not shown
by the face. A similar remark applies. to
the sense of shame under reproach. That
feeling will not be betrayed by a blush,
because the Individual is not afflicted by
the disease.â Pearson's Weekly.
Wedding Superstitions.
The bride who finds a spider on her
wedding dress n%y consider herself
blessed.
The bride who dreams of fairies the
night before her marriage will be thrice
blessed.
If the bridegroom carries a miniature
horseshoe in his pocket be will always
have good luck.
Ship marriages are considered anything
but lucky. Get married on land, or don't
get married at all.
No bride or groom should be given a
telegram while on the way to church. It
Is positively a sign of evil.
If the wedding ring is dropped during
the ceremony the bride may as well wish
herself unborn, for she will always have
111 luck.
Kiss a bride after the ceremony, and
before the newly made husband has a
chance to do so, and you will have ex
cellent luck throughout the year.
Maidens eager to wed should give dish
water heated to the boiling point a wide
berth. It means that they will not marry
for a long time If they attempt to cleanse
dishes in water so hot.
Should a bride perchance see a coffin
while being driven to the railway station
prior to departing upon her honeymoon
she should order the driver to turn back
and start over again, or else she will
surely meet with bad luck.â Kansas City
Journal.
DEWEV MAY

Invited to Admission
Day Celebration.
Mayor Phelan has just received the fol
lowing letter from Admiral Dewey ln re
sponse to an invitation requesting his
presence in this city at the fiftieth anni
versary of the admission of California to
the Union. The letter is self-explanatory
and gives fair promise of the hero being
here next September:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12. IJOO.
My Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowl
edge the receipt this day, through Hon. Julius
Kahn, of an Invitation from yourself and rep
resentatives of the "Native Sons of the Golden
Â¦\Vest" to be present at the celebration of the
fiftieth anniversary of the admission of Cali
fornia to the sisterhood of States, at San Fran
cisco, on September 9 next. I am not yet able
tn state whether or not I will be present at
that time, but I assure you it will give me
great pleasure to accept your Invitation if it
is possible for me to do bo. Very truly yours,
GEORGE DEWEY.
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor, San Fran
cisco. Cal.
and who was arrested by Officers Walsh
and Leonard for vagrancy.
This particular coon has been many
times in trouble. The times he has ap
peared ln the local police courts for vari
ous minor offenses are beyond computa
tion and on several occasions he has ap
peared with more serious charges than
mere misdemeanors against his name. He
is a customer as ugiy in disposition as he
Is in looks.
Both his limbs have been amputated at
the knee and he uses the resultant de
formity as a means with which to excite
the compassion of the passer-by. When
ever he is spoken to by a policeman he
answers with a flow of obscenity and pro
fanity that generally results in hie arrest,
which, arrest is invariably followed by his
liberation the next morning by some sym
pathetic Judge. Usually because of his
misfortune he is gently handled by the
patrolmen, notwithstanding the vilenesa
he heaps upon them.
Yesterday when put under arrest he
commenced his usual tactics. He called
the two officers every name in the Cdta
logue and a whole lot that showed him to
be an Inventive genius of more than or
dinary talent. He cursed them person
ally, individually, severally and collec
tively. He reviled their eyes, lungs, liv
ers, and held forth eloquently on their
characters, moral, physical and intellec
tual. He damned them in their private
and official capacity and then he began to
descant on their families.
Leonard looked on and smiled, the char
acter and inttrmity of the negro placing
him below notice. Walsh tried to emulate
the unconcern of his more phlegmatic
brother officer, but the negro s diatribe
and his own Irish blood proved too much
of a combination for him to buck against.
He stepped in to give his dusky prisoner
a gentle reminder, and the next minute
imagined that he had fallen foul of a
passing cyclone.
The darky jumped him like a fiend. Up
leaped astride the Walsh shoulders and
cross-countered him with one of the leg
stumps so hard that the two men mmc
to the ground together. For the next
minute It was hard to distinguish between
Irishman and negro. Nothing could be
teen but a piebald mass revolving ln a
cloud of dust. The black man worked
with his stumps as well as with his arms,
and the short leg jabs he sent in could be
heard a block away as they landed on the
Walsh, cranium. Finally the wagon drove
up. and Leonard, thinking the begc-A"
ha.l about enough fun for one afternoon,
hauled him on" the nearly moribund
Walsh and sent him to the station.
Policeman Walsh will not be allowed to
do duty to-day, or until his face resumes
pome of its natural form, as it Is feiTed
by his superiors that with his present dis
figurement he would be sure to break the
Sabbath. . ; .J

Baggara Ferocity.
In the beginning of the year IS9Â« the
English general from Cairo was inspect
ing the frontier force at Wadi Haifa. The
troops were engaged ln a fleld-day when
news came that a party of Dervishes had
attacked and put to the sword the village
of Addendan, some twenty miles north of
Haifa. The Camel Corps at once started
to try and cut off the raiders In the desert
on their return Journey, but with little
chance of success, as the news was more
than twenty-four hours old. After going
some fifty miles a patrol got on to their
tracks and found there the body of a
black girl some ten years of age. her feet
cut to ribbons by the rocks and stones
over which she had been driven, her back
flayed by the stripes of her merciless
captors. She had been beaten along until
she could move no more and then left to
die ln the desert.
Within a few weeks of this a Dervish
patrol came down to within a mile of Bar
ras one evening. Two little boys were
going out from the village to their father,
who was tending hla sakieh. They met
this patrol and greeted the leader. Ho
replied with a spear-thrust and hia com
panions finished the work he had begun.
The poor wee bodies were found by the
troops a short time afterward beheaded
and disemboweled.
The following incident shows the un
tamable ferocity of the Bargarat Soon
after the occupation of the Dongola pro
vince a Camel Corps patrol went out from
Debba to the wells of Kofrlat. These
wells are very deep and a long rope Is
requisite in order to obtain water. Close
to the wells the patrol discovered the
dead body of a Baggara warrior along
side his slaughtered horse. The man. a
fugitive from Dongola and tortured with
thirst, had arrived at the wells. Finding
no means of .obtaining water and accept
ing his fate, he had deliberately killed his
horse, broken hia saddle, cut his bridle to
pieces, burled his weapons and then calm
ly laid himself down to die. satisfied that
nothing of his would fall Into bis enemy**
hands.
The principal leader ln most of the fron
tier raids was one Osman Azrak by name,
who afterward met a well-merited death
at Omdurman. He was the ogre of the
frontier and enjoyed an almost supernat
ural reputation, combined with an un
canny habit of being killed and coming to
life again. The Inhabitants of Berts,
which oasis he raided, described him to
the officer commanding the Camel Corps
as a giant sight feet nigh and with one
eye in the middle of his forehead.âCorn
bill Magazine.

adnock by Captain McGowan because the man climbed the Bide of the vessel
forward Instead of aft, as demanded by naval usage. It. la maintained that
the captain Intended to fire over the man and scare him but that he was hit
In the hip and died soon afterward.
The other subject of comment la the fact that Commander 8. W. Very of
the Castlne, up to the present time, has had every officer on the vessel with
one exception under suspension and one of them has objected. Although the
authorities desire to quiet the proceedings, the officer will have to be heard
and the matter will be carried to the department at Washington.
SAYS THAT LENT
JILTED HER AND
SHOULD BE SHOT
Miss Wood Lays Claim
to the Attorney.
SAYS HE WAS HER FIANCE
Miss Nellie Wood, who claims that for
the past six years she has been the af
fianced bride of Eugene Lent, is anxious
to see the man who two days ago an
nounced his engagement to Mrs. Bertha
Welch-Russell ornamenting one of the
slabs at the Morgue,
According to Miss "Wood, Eugene Lent
is "a villain and ought to be shot." The
woman does not propose to do the shootÂ«
Ing herself or to seek redress in a court
of Justice for the humiliation she claims
to have suffered. All she wants is to see
her etory published broadcast, so the
"world may know Eugene Lent Just as
he Is."
Miss Wood sent for reporters from all
the papers yesterday and told the follow.
Ing story of her woes:
"Until I read the announcement of Mr.
Lent's engagement to Mrs. Kussell in the
papers," eald she, "I had no Intimation
that all was over with us. I have been
engaged to Mr. Lent six years. He vis
ited me ten days ago. He said* nothing
then about breaking off the engagement.
He at that time reproached himself and
said that he was not worthy of me, and
I rebuked him for making, such a state
ment. I know of no reason why Mr. Lent
has jilted me for Mrs. Russell, except
that she has money and I have none. I
feel no bitterness toward Mrs. Russell,
but I think that Mr. Lent has acted like
a villain. Had he been man enough to
come and tell me that he desired to break
the engagement that would have been
somewhat different. But he has chosen
to humiliate me, and I will not allow the
matter to go by without having all the
facts known. I have determined the pub
lic shall know how I have been treated
and what sort of a man Mr. Eugene
Lent Is.
"I have known Mr. Lent almost from
childhood. I have been warned against
him, but I could not distrust him, for he
eeemed entirely devoted. There were cir
cumstances that, as I now recall them,
ought to have told me the truth, but I.
blindly trusted. The first I ever saw of
Mrs. Russell was when- he gave a dinner
to her ln the University Club. He invited
me to be present. I told him he was do
ing a foolish thing, and he answered that
it was a matter of business. He was not
making much money as a lawyer, he ex
plained; the Welches were rich, and if he
could get their law business it would be a
good thing, worth fully $5000 per annum,
and, of course, what helped him, he said,
would be good for us both. I went to
the dinner.
"Not long ago Mr. Lent told me that he
was without money; that his mother was
ill and ail allowances of money from her
had been stopped. He said he was anxioua
to raise money. I offered him my engage
ment ring to raise money on temporarily.
He afterward told me that he had carried
It back to Hammersmith & Field and that
they had given him one-half what It orig
inally cost. I was surprised and grieved
that he could do that. He said that he
would not ask me to give him back other
articles of value, because they had my
name upon them. I would have given
him back everything that ever he gave
me If he had asked It.
"We had no quarrels."
Mr. Lent, the gentleman Miss Wood
claims won her affections only later to
throw them aside, would cay nothing re
garding the sensational statements Miss
Wood had Been fit to make. "She is a
lady," was nil he would say, "and I will
not say anything against her."
Miss Wood is the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs Jay Lagsden and the niece of R.
G. Dun of the Dun Commercial Apenoy
of New York. She lives at the Palace
Hotel with her parents and 1b well known
in local society. . . .
Indians have discovered that It Is as fiery
a beverage as cheap whisky. A teaspoon
ful will cause choking and coughing for
several minutes ln a throat unaccustomed
to swallowing the powerful stuff. Red
Ink Is another favorite beverage of the
Indians since the Federal authorities have
begun to exercise stricter supervision over
their copper-skinned wards. It Is the or
dinary red Ink which a bookkeeper use*
ln his balance sheets and which book
stores sell for writing purposes. The Ink
drinker of cultivated tastes will buy bot
tles by the half dozen and swallow the
contents with relish. Essences which
white people use for puddings are swal
lowed in guantlty by the Indians and have
been used ln that way for years. Wood
alcohol, accounted poison ln most parts
of the country, is consumed ln consider
able quantities diluted with water. 17 â Mil

INDIAN GOVERNMENT
MUST PURCHASE SILVER
Reserve of the Calcutta Currency De
partment Has Been Heavily
Depleted.
LONDON, Jan. 20.â The idea that the
Indian Government will shortly have to
buy silver has stimulated the demand.
Indications that the Oliver reserve of the
Indian currency department has been
heavily depleted and will be further re
duced are found In the large sales, tele
graphic transfers upon India, further ear
marking of gold for the account of the
Indian Government and the dispatch of
gold direct to India, Out of sixteen and
ft. half crores of cash reserve only about
ec ven crorcs are silver.
According to the Statist, should a fur
ther-two millions of gold be sent to In
dia during the next two months the silver
holdings of the Indian Government will
be probably reduced to about four crorcs.
Before such a figure Is reached purchases
of silver for coinage ought to be made,
unless the Indian Government is prepared
to Incur risks which might bring disaster.
The Statist Insists that the Government
must buy silver without delay and have it
coined as quickly as possible, and reasons
that India ought not to be subjected to
further trials on top of the famine, also
pointing out that if troubles break out on
the Afghan frontier silver alone will be
usable.

Immediately after the trouble Shea said

story completely, testifying to having
been the assailant and that Bassett had
acted In self-defense.

Farmers
â * Furrows
A fanner is known by his furrow as
" the carpenter is known by his chips." It
takes a finu hand and a true eye to turn
a straight furrow. No wonder the farmer
wears out, spite of exercise and fresh air.
One day's work on the farm would^tire
many atrained athlete. And the fanner
vrorks hardest of all. The first up and
tbe lart to bed, feeding his team before
he feeds himself, his work is practically
never done. Why does not the farmer
treat his own lx>dy as he treats the land
he cultivates? He puts back in phos-
phate what he takes out in crops, or the
land would grow poor. The farmer
should put back into his body the vital
rinnmtl exhausted by labor. If he does
cot, he will soon complain of "poor
health." The great value of Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery is in its vital-
ising power. It gives strength to the
ctornach, life to the lungs, purity to the
blood. It supplies Nature with the sub-
stances by v.hich she builds up the body,
just as the fanner supplies Nature with
the substances that build up the crops.
-I write to tell you of thr prcat benefit I re- !
crwd from the use of Dr. Pferce's Golden Med-
ic.il Discove;y." writes Mr. C. B. Bird, of Byrn-
Â«de. Patnr.ra Co .W. Va. â¢It cured me of a very

BERLIN. Jan. 20.â During the coming
â¢reek the naval bill will be the main pr>
litioaJ topic. H is surmised that the
measure will reach the Reichstag early
In ?hr- v.eek. as the Bundes=rath has ex
pro>.-=c-Â«i beforehand its readiness to pass
It. Its fate in the Reichstag, parliament
ta.riar.s now say. probably is by no means
assured, though it Is predicted that
enough members of the Central party will
support the bill to enable its passage. The
force of recent events has been telling
altogether In favor of the measure and
en enormous amount of agitation on the
subject lias been made by t!ie fleet enthu
elasts throughout the empire. Judging
from the. present prospects, the corre-
Fpondcnce of the Associated Press can
foretell that the naval bill, in which ths
Erajxror's whole heart hangs, will be
rasped after a number of assurances and
Explanations about thtre being no need of
new taxes from the Government, though
uith The smallest majority.
The German press to-day comments
liberally on yesterday's interpellation In
the Reichi-tag on the p* -izure of German
creamers by British cruisers. The J.okal
Anzciger pays: "The whole Eession
Ehowed that since the English answer
was known beforehand this peculiar par
liamentary action might have been
fpared us."
The Frcis-sinnige Zoitung expresses the
opinion that the interpellation took both
h. dignified and an appropriate course.
The Vossische Zeitung asserts that
'"Count Ton Bulow showed on the whole
ts much tact as energy." a_nd well de
f-orved the ovation which the Reichstag
yesterday accorded him.
The Doutsche Tages Zeitung. with the
Â¦whnie Agrarian party, is not satisfied
with the results. The paper Fays: "In
t!iÂ» Reichstag there was loud applausa
after Yon Bulow's speech; in the land.
Â«c can assure the delegates, there was
bitter disappointment."
Thf National Zeitung says: "The effect
of yesterday** proceeding on public opin
ion In England will be in the nature of a
corrector, we hope."
The Wrwarts calls the interpellation
E. "miscarried farce."
The Post, enumerating what Great
Britain offers in reparation, says: "Truly
all these art- tuccesses on which we may
rr^riice heartily; because they meant that
Cull satisfaction is given to Germany."
The Tagcblatt in its comments remarks:
"England now knows fully that in thÂ«*
German empire s=l;e faces a country which
*\i'.l not yield a hair's breadth from what
is conceived to be right. The Foreign
Ministf-r and the Reichstag both carefully
eyoided s-houting triumph at Great Br:tÂ«
p.i:\'s backdown, but people in England
will deduce a lesson from this reserve
t!..tt the German empire, whose moaerate
policy is supported by a vast majority
of its Parliament, cannot be provoked
v.iih Impunity."
The Barth bill in the Diet respecting the i
Prussian ejection districts meets with the I
Government's disapproval; although it is !
admitted that the existing system is s>u- j
fiÂ« rannuated. The Government's argu- I
ment is that the Barth districting would I

FRENCH MINISTRY
WELL SUPPORTED
Showing of Strength in
the Chamber.
HAS A MAJORITY OF DEPUTIES
WIIX NOW PROCEED TO CARRY
OUT ITS PLANS.
Likely to Endeavor to Force Through
the Treaty of Reciprocity
With the United
States.
Copyright. UOO, by the Associated Press.
PARIS. Jan. 20.â The Ministry of M.
Waldeck-Rousseau. which Its national
opponents declared was tottering to its
fall and would receive its death blow im
mediately upon the reopening of Parlia
ment, has obtained a fresh lease of life
in the first week of the Parliamentary
session by the substantial majority it re
ceived on the vote of confidence in the
Chamber of Deputies on the Interpella
tion regarding the attitude of the Gov
ernment toward the strikers at St.
Etlenne.
Early in the week the Nationalists were>
much rejoiced over an Important check
to the Government's school project In
committee, but Thursday's Government
victory shattered their hopes and left the
Cabinet In an unexpectedly strong posi
tion, which encourages it to persist In its
projects.
The situation, it Is believed, will have
an indirect bearing upon the prospects of
the American reciprocity treaty, which,
despite the sanguine predictions of the
officials hero, was thought in some quar
ters to be imperilled by the influential in
dustrial and agricultural opposition. The
fact that the Government is entitled to
count upon a strong backing, as revealed
by Thursday's vote on the strike Inter
pellation, may induce it to endeavor to
force the treaty through.
The test of the Government's strength,
however, will take place shortly In the
Chamber of Deputies In the naval pro-
IÂ»osal. which involves an expenditure ot
750,W0,000 francs, of which 500.000,000 francs
is to be devoted to the reorganization ot
the fleet. M. Delaporte. a Radical Dep
uty from Dux-Sevres, who reported on
the scheme, has just declared himself fa
vorable to the majority plan. His report
makes some Interesting remarks regard
ing tho proposed submarine boats, espe
cially in connection with recent experi
ments at Washington with the subma
rine boat Holland. He asserts that the
new type of submarine vessel, of which
th<Â» Government proposed to build two,
will have a sphere of action on the sur
face of the water of from 200 to 400 knots,
and a submarine sphere of action of from
forty to forty-five knots. Thus, he says,
these vessels will be of offensive value
Instead of a merely defensive typo. He
expresses the hope that France will pro
vide herself with a large number of these
submarine war vessels. The. press warm
ly supports their construction as a protec
tion to the coast in the event of an atÂ»
tack from the British navy in war.
In the Chamber of Deputies practically
the whole we*>k was devoted to tho dis
cussion of the railway budget, during
which several speaker* compared a num
ber of features of French railway work
ings with the American system. M. Val
iant, Socialist Deputy representing one of
the Seine districts, demanded the adop
tion of the American system of automatic
car couplers, declaring that half the mor
tality among French railway men was
due to the imperfect system of couplers.
The Director of Railways replied that this
matter was under consideration and that
undoubtedly a suitable system would
shortly be Instituted.
The elections for the renewal of 110 seats
in the Senate, which will occur on Jan
uary US. are anxiously awaited, as the re
sult will Indicate the feeling of the coun
try toward the Government. In view of
its Dreyfus policy and the High Court
prosecutions there is a strong moderate-
Republican opposition to the ministerial
candidates.
The most interesting contest in the con
: Btltuency Is !n Loire, where General Mer
cier. the inveterate antagonist of Dreyfus
and one of the Nationalist idols, is pitted
agains-t the Government candidate, a Rad
ical.
President Louhet recently 'gave a clever
I setback to the Nationalist claims of his
â¢ unpopularity in the army by a pretty dis
| play of tact. The occasion was the recent
shooting party at Rambouillet. Instead of
issuing formal invitations to the officers
of the garrison and the principal authori
ties President Loubet announced that they
I need only inscribe themselves on the list
I of guests, with the gratifying result that
I practically every olflccr in the vicinity

M. Pickard. Commissioner General of
the Paris Exposition, announces that most
of the buildings are now in an advanced
1 state of construction and that the open
! ing of the exposition will occur on the ad
! vertised date, even if it becomes necessary
I to work day and night shifts. The Ameri-
I can section is the subject of many appre-
I dative notices In the press. The Repub
i lie Francalse says:
"From every point of view the United
States will have a place worthy of them."
and adds that it considers that the ex
hibit of American schools will surprise
many, as American methods will be a rev
elation to European nations.
The sensation caused by the reported
heavy losses by speculation of Count Boni
dp Castellane was only of one day's dura
tion here in view of the emphatic denial
given the story by his father. Unless the
cavalier fashion in which the Figaro
treated the Marquis de Castellane's letter.
which is stated it consigned to the waste
papc-r basket, should have further results,
interest now naturally turns to the state
ment which Count Boni is expected to
mako on his arrival in New York.
Mrs. Eddy, mother of Spencer F.

OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
THE trade statistics of the four years ending
June 30, 1899, are of interest. England and her
dependencies remain our heaviest customers,
taking more than half our agricultural exports. Ger
many follows next as a long second, and France ranks
third as a consumer of the surplus of our farms.
These three take 75 PÂ«r cent of all of it. Of the re
mainder the Netherlands took 4.3 per cent, Belgium
36, Canada 3.5, Italy 2.2, and Spain 1.5. Their trade
accounts for 15. 1 per cent of the 25 per cent not
taken by England, Germany and France. This leaves
0.9 per Â»'cent, which went to Brazil, Cuba, the Brit
ish West Indies, Mexico, British Africa, European
Russia, Denmark, Hongkong, Japan, Portugal, Swe

THE SITUATION IN KENTUCKY
A DISPATCH from Frankfort concerning thÂ«
affray between Colonel Colson and Lieuten
ant Scott, in which three men were killed and
others severely wounded, says: "It is regarded as
fortunate that the affair had no relation to politic.
and that both the principals and two of the dead be
longed to the same political party, so that the trouble
could not be traced to politics by any sort of rea
soning. It is believed the affair will have a terroriz
ing and yet tranquillizing effect on everybody here."
If the statements of the dispatch be well founded,
and the angry political factions in Kentucky be
brought by the fearful tragedy of last Tuesday to
put restraint upon their passions, we may have an
other illustration of an evil resulting in good. It is
safe to say that if the political contest should once
pass from words to pistol shots there would be
started a series of affrays in every pan of the State,
and the feuds resulting from them would lead to fur
ther bloodshed for years tn mm*.
It is gratifying to note that the leaders on each side
have counseled moderation all along. It has been
largely due to their efforts that peace has been pre
served so far. The source of danger lay in the deter
mination of certain Democrats to carry the struggle
imo the Legislature for the purpose of seating Goe
bel as Governor despite the action of the State Com
mission, a Democratic body, in declaring Goebel de
feated and giving a certificate of election to Taylor
Democrats outside the State have been active in
trying to save their party in Kentucky from the
blunder of counting Goebe] in by a partisan action of
the Legislature, and the counsel has had considerable
influence. The situation seems to have had a sobering
effect even upon William Jennings Bryan, for th:
Louisville Post asserts that Senator Blackburn re
cently received a letter from him in which Bryan
said: "It appears to me that the action of the Demo
crats in Kentucky is without precedent. The Repub
licans have been given the certificates, and it would
appear to an outsider that the best interests of the
Democratic party demand that the Republicans be al
lowed to serve out the full terms of the State offices
In fact, I believe the salvation of the party to a cer
tain extent depends upon the abandonment by the
Democrats of the contest proceedings."
If Bryan wrote such a letter it is one of the things
in his political career which can be quoted to his
credit. There is. in fact, nothing in the situation in
Kentucky to justify either eide in a resort to violence
no matter what the other side may do. If the Demo
crats be w,se they will abandon all efforts to reopen
the controversy and will permit Taylor to hold his
office b peace. If, however, they take up the issue
in the Legislature and by reason of their majority in
that body unseat Taylor through the forms of law it
ma then be the duty of the Republicans to submit
It will not be long before there will be a new dec
lion and a new appeal to the people, and to that ap
peal the parry- which deems itself wronged in the
present may safely trust. The warning of the dreadful
occurrence at Frankfort can hardly be overlooked or
ignored, and it is to be hoped even the most reckless
partisans on either side will profit by the lesson.

CLEMENT ANSWERS SQUIRES.
Another Contribution to the Civil
Service Controversy.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest,
Editor of The Call: O. D. Squires has a
communication in your Issue of to-day refer
ring to and commenting upon an editorial In
your issue of yesterday, entitled "Reform Go
ing Backward," In which he freely mentions
my name and seeks to draw from me a state
ment of the legal grounds upon which I, as
the original author of the civil service law
embodied In the charter, would, if called upon
to do so, defend that part of the law which
prohibits removals of appointees except for
cause, and guarantees tenure during good be
havior.
It was claimed in the editorial to which Mr.
Squires approvingly alludes that the logical
result of the decision of the Supreme Court of
this State in the recent case of Patton vs.
Board of Health. 19 Cal., December IS. hold-
Ing that "health Inspectors" are "officers"
within the meaning of section 16, article XX,
of the constitution, and that their TERM of
office not having been declared by the legis
lature, they hoid only during the pleasure of
the Board of Health, and are removable at the
will and pleasure of the board Is "TO REN
DER NUGATORY AND VOID THE ENTIRE
CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM CREATED BY
THE CHARTER."
Mr. Squires applauds the sentiments con
tained In the editorial, and somewhat glaringly
exposes his lack of knowledge of the real basis
of the civil service law by saying: "The Su
preme Court has RAISED THE QUESTION, as
you have pointed out In Patton vs. Board of
Health. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ If Mr. Clement is the man
I take him to be he win now come forward
and clear up this civil service mess â he being
In part responsible for It."
Tes, If being the author of the law and its
champion through two successive Boards of
Freeholders would constitute evidence of re
sponsibility I am Indeed partly responsible for
it; but as to Its being a "mess" by reason of
Its alleged conflict with section 16, article XX.
of the constitution, an construed by any recent
or former decision of th* Supreme Court. I beg
leave to arraign Mr. Squires for his thought
less and slighting characterization, and to say
to him through your columns that he only ex
poses his Ignorance of the civil service law by
so designating It.
Wlthout taking upon myself the labor of pre
paring a brief for the purpose of educating
Mr. Squires and acquainting him with the
points upon which I will, if called upon by
the city authorities to do so. defend the civil
service law against any attacks "the push"
may make upon it based upon its unconstltu
tlonallty under section 16. article XX. of the
constitution, I will now, with your permission,
call attention to a few tacta that will abund
antly show that we need not trouble ourselves
about constitutional objections which have not
yet arisen and which. In all probability, never
will arise.
The principle applied In Patton vs. Board of
Health la not at all new. The questions In
volved In the case have not "Just been raleed."
The same doctrine has been frequently laid
down in our Supreme Court in former decleions,
even as far back In the history of the State as
1857, in the case of People vs. Hill (7 Oil., 97).
in which the court held that "a law which pro
vides that an officer may be removed In a cer
tain way, or for a certain cause, does not re
strain or limit the power of removal to the
cause or manner indicated." l'o not suppose
for an instant that the author of the civil
service law was ignorant of these decisions of
our Supreme Court. THE FORCE AND VALUE
OF THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW DOES NOT
DEPEND UPON LIFE TENURE OR TEN
URE DURING GOOD BEHAVIOR. It depends
upon the manner in which apoolntments are
made rather than upon the length of their ten-
It is not admitted for one moment tliat the
constitution and laws of the State of California
AS THEY NOW STAND are repugnant to that
portion of the civil service law embodied In the
charter of San Francisco which contemplates
that the tenure of office of all deputlos, clerks,
copyists and employes appointed thereunder
Bhall be during good behavior. That is a ques
tion which will be mot whPn it arises. It will
be time enough to crocs the stream when we
get to It.
Assuming, however, that section 16, article
XX of the constitution prohibits tenure of office
for a longer period than four years, and that
all deputies, clerks, copyists and employes of
the city government who are appointed under
the civil service law are "officers" who can be
removed at the pleasure of the appointing
power, what officer or head of department
would remove a good and efficient appointee
when he Is required under the civil service law
to fill his place by a requisition upon the Civil
Service Commissioners, who send him a substi
tute appointed under the merit system after a
competitive examination?
"When the head of a department knows that
by removing or discharging an efficient deputy,
clerk or employe without Just cause he gains
nothing by It and cannot fill his place by
appointing, a personal friend or political fol
lower, but must resort to the Civil Service
Commission, whose appointee he is COM
PELLED to receive, he will in the natural
order of things let well enough alone. There
will be no Incentive or inducement on the part
of heads of departments to remove or dis
charge efficient deputies, clerks or employes,
when they have no power to fill their places
by others of their own choosing. Therefore,
even if the constitution and laws as they now
stand shall be held and construed by the Su
preme Court to give the right to heads of de
partments to remove appointees at their will
and pleasure, it will in no degree impair or
destroy the efficacy of the civil service law as
to the manner of appointments where MERIT
will be looked to and not POLITICAL
FAVORITISM WITH ITS ATTENDANT
CORRUPTION AND INEFFICIENCY.
Then again, assuming that the various
DEPUTIES of the department are "offlrers"
within the meaning of section 16, article XX of
the constitution, and are removable without
cause, c-ven then the effectiveness of the civil
service law for good would not be seriously
impaired, for the reason that the great bulk
of the clerical force In all the departments of
the- city government (which the civil service
law is Intended to protect) are clerks, copyists
and other kinds of employes who cannot by
any mode of construction be denominated "of
ficers."
The teachers In our public schools enjoy the
prlvlltjte of tenure of office during Rood be
havior and cannot be removed without cause.
It was bo held In the case of Kennedy vs. The
Board of Kducatlon, 82 Gal. 453. The clerks,
copyists and other classes of employes are no
more "officers," and Indeed not so much as the
school teachers, and yet teachers have been
protected in the tenure of office for years,
notwithstanding section 16. article XX of the
constitution.
I would, therefore, suggest to Mr. Squire*
and the "push" generally that they do not too
hastily take It for granted that the civil ser
vice law Is "nugatory and void." Walt until
you hear from the Supreme Court In a case
arising under the charter and thÂ« constitution
and laws as they now stand.
HENRY N. CLEMENT.
â¬an Francisco, Jan. 20.
THE RIGHT OF SEARCH.
IT seems to be agreed that Great Britain's reply to
our diplomatic note on the seizure of American
flour in neutral bottoms cleared from an American
to a neutral port leaves in an equivocal position her
claim of right to seize and search neutrals on the
high seas. As far as the note has been made public
it does not appear to abandon that claim. A state
ment is made that her naval officers will hereafter be
guided by the neutral ship's manifest. If it show no
contraband in the cargo the ship will not be searched.
But the neutral ship must first be seized and her cap
tain must yield to the peremptory order of a British
officer to exhibit her manifest. Suppose that he re
fuse to heave to when ordered, and if halted by a
cannon shot he refuse to exhibit his manifest to one
who by American law has no right to see it, does the
present state of the British claim of right mean that
his ship is to receive a prize crew and be sailed into
an English port for condemnation?
There were American captains on deep water once
who would refuse to obey on the high seas a de
grading order from a British officer, who had no
more right to issue it than Lafitte or Captain Kidd.
Perhaps there arc none now.
But, whether there are or not. the claim of Great
Britain is simply a renewal of her aggressive policy
of claiming the oceans as her own, with the right
to obstruct and pirate the world's commerce which
traverses them. The manifest of an American ship is
in a high sense a document of commercial confi
dence; when an American deep water ship is entered
at a Custom-house of the United States her mani
fest is not tacked on the wall for public inspection.
It concerns only the customs service and the owners
of the ship and of her cargo. If a British officer
should enter an American Custom-house and de
mand possession of the outward manifest of an Amer
ican ship he would speedily hear of something to his
disadvantage.
The English note is said to abandon seizure of food
as contraband "under ordinary conditions." What
are ordinary conditions and what extraordinary?
There are no definitions furnished. The note is posi
tively no assurance of the safety of our commerce.
It is believed, of course, that "ordinary conditions"
in the British diplomatic dictionary means when the
foodstuff is on the way to a British port to feed the
British army which is trying to invade the Trans
vaal. Hay and oats are notoriously going from this
country to the Cape to feed British cavalry horses
and draft animals. In like manner our flour and
tinned goods of all descriptions are going to her
ports for the sustenance of her invading soldiers. The
right of a neutral to sell to either belligerent is un
deniable. Therefore, what right has England to
seize American goods going to a neutral port, lest the
merchandise reach her enemy?
The test of her sincerity and her definition of "or
dinary conditions" would be the finding of American
contraband of war in a neutral bottom consigned to
her own ports. Does any one believe that she would
seize such contraband or disclose its existence, ex
cept, perhaps, by offering it convoy to its destina
tion?
American interests require that the British answer
to the American note be made public. If becoming
"a world power" has made it necessary to smother
inquiries like that raised by Senator Hale's resolution,
then popular rights are incompatible with the inter
ests of a world power.
But no such thing is done in England. There the
Ministerial benches in the Commons must answer
inquiries of this kind or take the consequences. Not
a movement of the Ministry in military or civil af
fairs can be held back. Is this Government less re
sponsible to the people than the British monarchy?
We feel that this issue very deeply concerns the
commercial interests of American citizens, and is des
tined to affect the future current of politics in this
country.
A prominent Eastern imperialist recently said:
"Every American expansionist should stand by Great
Britain against the South African republics, for her
cause there is the same as ours." While such dam
aging utterances are being indulged in, the British
seizure of German ships on the high seas is not only
enraging German sentiment on the Continent, but
that feeling infects the vast German population of this
country, as is everywhere shown by the German ex
pressions in the pro-Boer meetings which are being
held throughout the United States.
In our judgment nothing can be more unfortunate
than that those who profess to speak for the President
shall persistently identify our policy with that of Eng
land and make them so apparently interdependent
that one stands or falls with the other.
The claim of England to do purely piratical acts on
deep water, directed against neutral commerce, is in
tolerable. It exceeds even the pretensions of Bona
parte's Berlin decree, by which he outlawed all na
tions that maintained commerce with Great Britain
and condemned their property to seizure on the high
seas as contraband. Great Britain winced under that
decree and it was the means of enabling her to form
the alliance which finally overthrew Bonaparte and
the French empire at Waterloo. Her present claim,
even if limited to the forcible inspection of manifests,
is no more tenable nor tolerable than the Berlin de
cree. It is equally dangerous to the freedom of com
merce and is made for exactly the same purpose that
actuated Bonaparteâ the forcible and criminally ag
gressive extension of empire.
Surely the people of the United States want no
partnership in such, a policy,, and the early spirit of
the Republican party rises in protest against it.
ply an increased demand in Great Britain, Germany,
France, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan,
Italy, Denmark and British Africa. Our export trade
with Central and South America was less in 1899 than
in 1894, and seems to be rapidly disappearing. It re
ceived a great impulse from the Venezuela incident,
but has declined ever since the Spanish war.
Our exports to Asia for the five year period
amounted to 1.16 per cent of our whole export trade,
and increased from $3,801,998 in 1894 to $14,671,349
for the fiscal year 1898, or at the rate of $2,173,870 per
year, hardly making good the losses in our own hem
isphere.
The hold of Europe on the trade of 75,000,000 of
people in our own hemisphere has been greatly en
larged and apparently for entirely political reasons.
From the Rio Grande to the Straits of Magellan there
seems to be a fear of the motives of the % United
States, and the erection of statues to Mr. Monroe has
ceased.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JAjNTJARY 21, 1900.
CONDITIONS IN PORTO RICO
THE people of Porto Rico were not in revolt
against Spain, nor were they disposed to defend
her sovereignty of the island. When our army
of occupation landed on their shores, after the fall of
Santiago and the practical defeat of Spain in Cuba,
the Porto Ricans welcomed us, and the small Spanish
force there made no more than a perfunctory resis
tance.
The island had been prosperous, through its com
mercial relations with Spain, and the people were in
a fair state of thrift and contentment.
We have had jurisdiction over the island for more
than a year and a half, during which it has been an
annexed appendage of the United States. The change
of flags ended its trade with Spain, as all its products
were at once scheduled as foreign and subjected to
the rates fixed by the Spanish protective tariff upon
foreign merchandise. At the same time they were ex
cluded from our markets fixed by the American pro
tective tariff. The result, of course, has been a ces
sation of commerce. The Porto Ricans, compelled to
stew in their own juice, and being unable to eat each
other, have lapsed into a condition of dire misery and
distress. The last Congress went by without legisla
tion that should fix the metes and bounds of their
new status. They have remained under military gov
ernment, and the only moves .made have been the
rather remarkable report made by the commission
sent there to measure them for the garments of gov
ernment and the President's recommendation that the
Jamaica reciprocity treaty,- be extended to their
products. The government recommended for them
was based on a denial of their right to elect to even
the smallest political office. They were to have a Gov
ernor General, appointed by the President. That
Governor was to appoint certain district deputies,
and these in turn were to choose local subordinate
officers, down to the least.
The President's recommendation as to the admis
sion of their trade has not met with favor, and the
Jamaica treaty, which was the model chosen by the
executive, has been picked to pieces by the American
interests which it antagonized. These interests are
largely Californian, and the opposition of this State
is already embattled at Washington and is busy in
the assault.
Meanwhile the condition of Porto Rico increases in
difficulty and distress. Much of the productive realty
of the inland was under mortgage when the transfer
of sovereignty occurred. These mortgages were
largely contracted for extension of industrial enter
prises, for the long disturbed conditions of Cuba had
destroyed Cuban trade with Spain and increased the
demand for Porto Rican products and the profits of
their production. Our military authorities last year
decreed that these maturing mortgages should be ex
tended one year, the limit to expire January 29, 1900.
As the limit was approached ability to pay the mort
gages declined for lack of a foreign market and by
the universal stagnation of trade. A native of the
island has just reported to Washington that the situa
tion is acute. Out of a total population of 1,000,000
there are 2<58.000 abject beggars, and as many more
living in awful poverty, contriving to underfeed them
selves and avoid beggary. So that more than half the
people are in squalor and want. This agent says:
"The foreign commerce of the island has shrunk to
almost nothing, and will not revive as long as freedom
of trade with the United States is denied. We are
worse off now than when under Spanish rule, ras
cally and oppressive as it was, and unless something
is speedily done to relieve our suffering the island
will sink to a state of wretchedness and pauperism im
possible to describe."
The protected interests of the United States, accus
tomed to a tariff defense against the cheaper labor of
the tropics, protest against Porto Rican competition,
for exactly the same reason that was in their demand
for protection. The change of flags does not change
conditions for the domestic producer. He founded an
industry under our system. To take away his pro
tection now and admit the Porto Rican competition
which caused it to be provided for him will, from the
protective standpoint, transfer American prosperity
to the island and Porto Rican pauperism and distress
to the United States.
Harpers' Weekly, which is strongly imperialist, ad
mits frankly that, bad as Spanish rule was and dis
tressing as it was in the burden of taxation imposed,
our rule there imposes greatly higher taxes, while the
industrial decline makes them harder to pay.
Yet it may be taken as absolutely true that Con
gress will not legislate on this subject at this session.
It will go over as Hawaii did last year and is likely
to again. But when, either by legislation or executive
order, the commercial relation is touched, American
interests are likely to wince painfully. There is no
reasoning that will reconcile our countrymen to part
with prosperity for the benefit of others. The Demo
cratic party tried it, and has never been able to leave
its sickbed since. Republican free trade is not differ
ent from Democratic free trade, and Republicans
simply will not submit to it. The only civil official
act affecting Porto Rico since our flag went there is
the authoritative order to spell the name Puerto Rico.
This of course is highly gratifying to the natives, who
are captious about the orthography of their insular
home. But, while Americans will put the required
letters in their proper place and bow to the ortho
graphical authority of their Government, they will not
as willingly obsolete their own industries and pauper
ize their own labor and part with their own profits to
trade their own prosperity for Porto Rican beggary
and want. The free trade policy of England adapts it
self automatically to such conditions. Had Porto Rico
fallen to her, instead of an increase of beggary there
would have been an immediate access of prosperity.
But the American is not the English system. If any
thing is abhorred of our people it is Cobden free
trade. American wages and conditions are not com
patible with the pauper labor of the tropics. It
makes no difference whether that competition comes
from twenty millions of pauper laborers in the tropics
under twenty different flags or under one flag, and
that our own. Our labor has just emerged from the
famine and squalor of a Democratic free trade experi
ment. It has a full belly and a stout arm, and in
memory of its recent experience will object to being
sent again to gnaw bones with the dogs while it
sees its full meal eaten by the lean kinc of the tropics.

HIGH CARNIVAL
IS HELD BY THE
MAIL HANDLERS
Letter Carriers Give
an Annual Ball.
AFFAIR A SPLENDID SUCCESS
*
DR. J. F. DrLLON PRESENTED
WITH A HANDSOME CLOCK.
Members of the Association. Give a
Substantial Token of the Es
teem in Which They Hold
Their Physician.
The letter carriers of Ban Francisco
held high carnival ln Native Sons' Hall
last nlgrht, the occasion being the twelfth
annual ball of the Letter Carriers' Mutual
Aid Association. Elaborate arrangements
had been made for the affair and Its suc
cess was unqualified. About 200 couples
were ln attendance and enjoyed them
selves thoroughly. The decorations were
beautifulâ that Is the only word that will
fittingly describe them. The balconies
were festooned with delicately colored
bunting, . entwined with garlands of
flowers, with varl-colored streamers ex
tending from the balcony rails to the cen
ter of the ceiling, from which suspended
a magnificent canopy-like mass of bright
ribbons and flowers. The stage waa al
most hidden from view by a mass of
palms, flowers and tastefully arranged
bunting, and behind this screen of beauty
the orchestra discoursed sweet music, to
which the light-footed dancers kept time.
During the evening a magnificent onyx
clock was presented to Dr. J. F. Dillon,
who has been the physician of the asso
ciation for twelve years. Conrad Trleber,
who madÂ© the presentation speech on be
half of the association, spoke feelingly of
the hirh retrard in which the doctor is
hefd by all tnt carriers, and his eulogistic
words were indorsed by a vigorous burst
of applause. Dr. Dillon was completely
surprised and almost overcome, but he
pulled himself together and made a fitting
response. The clock is a work of art as
well as a splendid timepiece. On a gold
â¢late at its base is engraved the following
inscription: "To Dr. J. F. Dillon as a
token of esteÂ«m from the San Francisco
Letter Carriers' Mutual Aid Association,
January 20, 1900."

HOW FROSTS OCCUR
McAdle Will Go South to Study tha
Phenomena.
Forecast Official McAdle will leave for
the southern part of the State within the
next few days for the purpose of study
ing closely the conditions which bring
about the disastrous frosts which occur
In that section. The frost map which
Mr. McAdie has been publishing has been
distributed largely among the orange
growers In Southern California and they
are finding It of much practical value
The data which he expects to gather on
his proposed trip will be used In elaborat
ing his map and it Is probable that before
the next harvesting the fruit and grain
growers of the State will have even more
to thank Mr. McAdie for than they have
at present.
Laws are now prepared for the con
sideration of Congress which will greatly
facilitate the work of. the weather bureau
and if they are passed the California of
fice will find little trouble In maintaining
Its prestige as the best conducted
weather bureau weet of the Mississippi
The Chamber of Commerce has passed
resolutions indorsing the Congressional
bill which provides for changes In the

WANTS TO MOVE.
Mission Parlor Is Tired of Its Old
Home on Seventeenth Street.
On Seventeenth street, between Valen
cia and Guererro, there la a three-story
building that was erected by an associa
tion of Native Sons for the purpose of
being used as a fraternal hall by the Na
tive Sons and Daughters who had estab
lished parlors In the Mission dlstrlot and
the building is known as "Native Sons'
Hall"; also "Mission Parlor Hall." For
a long time the several organizations that
meet in that building have been dissatis
fied with the internal arrangement, for
the lodge or meeting rooms are on the
ground floor and the main or social hall
on the upper floors and reached by a very
peculiar combination of stairs. Mission
Parlor, or, rather, a large majority of the
members, for some time past have been
trying to move out of the building and
take quarters in the Native Sons' build
ing on Mason street, but they have been
balked by a minority that stood in the way
of a two-thirds vote necessary to carry
tho measure. At a meeting of the parlor
lost Wednesday the proposition to chanpp
the meeting place came up again and there
was an unusually SDirited debate. The
majority of the members for the third
time voted in favor of moving to Mason
street, the vote standing 61 in favor and
35 against. The proposition being in the
nature of an amendment to the by-laws
requires a two-thirds vote to carry At
the previous meeting a resolution to move
was carried by a large majority, but the
minority stayed proceedings by giving no
tice of appeal to the grand president. De
spite this action, the action alluded to
was taken last Wednesday in order to ex
pedite the matter and to forestall any
possible adverse action on the appeal.

A Rattled Author.
A not very courteous author, replying
to one of the Interview syndicates that
had propounded the question "iv hen do
you write and what do you get for what
you write?" said: , ...
"I write when I please, and it's none of
your darn business what I get for what
I write!"
But when the managing editor of the
syndicate informed him that he merely
wanted to know his terms so that he
might forward him a check for some work
he had in view, the author changed his
tune and wrote six pages of information
with an apology in postscript.

Southern Pacific Officials Return
"With One of Their Number 111.
J. C. Stubbs. Julius Kruttschnitt, J. A.
Fillmore and T. H. Goodman, who went
to Salt Lake City a few days ago to at
tend the meeting of the passenger men.
returned to this city yesterday without
having accomplished anything. The meet
ing was called for the purpose of arrang
ing a time card which should meet with
the Joint approval of the Southern Paci
fic. Union Pacific, Burlington. Rock Isl
and. Denver and Rio Grande and Rio
Grande Western roads. As some of the
roads were not yet ready to submit a
schedule the meeting was postponed, to
take place again in this city a week from
next Monday.
On the way home Mr. Goodman was
taken seriously ill with an attack of rheu
matism. He was suffering so when the
train drew toward its destination that the
car was sent around by the way of Xiles
to obviate the necessity of his beinff
moved on the boat. It is thought that
with care he will soon be around again,
as the malady is more painful than dan
gerous.
maugh were Lieutenant Lyman M. Welsh
of the Twentieth Infantry, W. C. Harllee
of the Thirty-third Infantry, who goes to
Washington to get a commission in the
marines?, and Dr. Lyman Bishop, veteri
nary surgeon of the transport Si.im.
The men on the Conemaugh tell a pa
thetic story of the killing of Major Lo^an.
One of his men had been shot by -i sharp
shooter and the major was bending over
him when the Fame sharpshooter killed
him. Thrn an orderly ran. to th-j assist
ance of the major and he also wus sno;,
and a hospital steward who went out to
render assistance to the three mm was
also shot. Then Major Lieberman dis
covered the sharpshooter in a tree a short
distance from the tiring line, and taking
careful aim Â¦with his revolver shot the
rebel dead. The bodies of the soldier, or
derly and hospital steward and Mnjor
Logan were then brought in, rjut all lour
had been instantly killed.
The steamer Doric was released from
quarantine yesterday and came over to
an anchorage off the Mail dock. The big
steamer Algoa and the- Mail boat China
are both loading for the Orieut. and the
Colon is discharging her New York and
Central American freight at the Mali
dock, so there will be no room for the
Doric until one of these vessels gets away,
which will probably be next Tuesday. The
Doric's consignment of silk was taken off
yesterday morning and by this time is on
its way East.
The naval reserve training ship Marlon
will be moved out into the stream to-day.
Howard street wharf No. 3. where she has
been moored, is to be torn down to make
room for a new pier similar to Folsom No.
1, so tho training ship has to be anchored
in the stream until a new berth can be
found for her.
The United States steamer Ranger
sailed for the coast of Central America on
a hurveying cruise yesterday.
The naval transport Scindla sailed for
Manila via Guam yesterday. As she
passed along the front all the tugs ami
steamers in the bay whistled a parting
salute in honor of lieutenant Commander
William Kilburn. executive officer or" the
transport. Lieutenant Commander Kil
burn is the brother of Paris Kilburn,
chairman of the Board of Harbor Com
missioners. He was appointed to An
napolis thirty-four years ago by General
Bid well, who was then a United States
Congressman. He was executive officer
of the San Francisco during the Spanish-
American war. and brought the New Or
leans, purchased from the Brazilian
Government, to America. Aft*r discharg
ing at Guam and Manila the Scindia will
go to Norfolk Xavy Yard.
Ole Olsen. "day man" on the steamer
Oakland, wishes now he had learned to
swim. When the 1 p. m. boat left the dock
he picked up his bucket and sponges.
Skipping in ragtime along the narrow rail
ing to wash the windows, a lively jag
step bucked him. pall in hand, into the
water. His seagull cries drew every one
on deck to watch him clinging to a pile,
frantically inventing some new steps to
his dance. A life-preserver and a rope
ended the performance.

UNION DAIRIES ARRAIGNED.
Protest Against Passage of a Resolu-
tion by Supervisors.
A protest was received yesterday by the
Board of Supervisors from Andrew N.
DethJefson against the passage of a reso
lution which limits the purchase of milk
for city institutions to union dairies. The
protestant alleges that there Is no organ
ization or corporation in this city known
as "union dairies." All dairies are inde
pendent at the present time, though a
few unsuccessful attempts have been
made to form a combination. Regarding
the petition of the San Francisco Lnbor
Council asking for discrimination in favor
of the dairies that employ union milkers
the protestant claims that the latter rep
resent a very small percentage of th*
labor engaged in that capacity In this
city. The assertion is made that sprouts
and brewery grains, which are unwhole
some, are fed to the cows in the dairies
where the union milkers are employed.
The protect concludes with a request that
the system of milk inspection heretofore
established be put in full force again.
Has taken such a hold in the medical world that it is the one assured remedy for disease.
PREJUDICE IS DISARMED by thousands of cures and daily letters, all pointing to that
remedy which is arousing 1 such interest among sufferers and physicians. I will now give to

Cromwell's Bible.
Cromwell's Bible was not what the Bible
Is to-day. Criticism, cor.-parative, chrono
logical, philological, historical, had not
impaired its position as the direct word ot
God. a single book, one and whole, one
page as inspired as another, one text as
binding as another. Faith in the literal
construction of the word was pushed to
an excess as much resembling true super
stition or overbellef as anything imputed
to the Catholics. Science had set up no
reign of law. nor hinted a doubt on the
probabilities of miraculous intervention.
No physical theories had dimmed faith In
acts of specific creation; the aerial per
spective and vistas of time were very
primitive. Whatever happened, great or
small, was due to wrath or favor from
above.
They were tormented by no misgivings,
as Ranke says, how "the secrets of divine
things could be brought into such direct
connection with the complications of hu
man affairs." The God to whom Crom
well in heart as in speech appealed was
no "stream of tendency." but the Lord
of Hosts of the Old Testament. The
saints and Puritans were the chosen peo

Bank, and M. I. Koshland of San Fran
cisco are here to-day in consultation with
depositors about the reopening of the
County Bank of San Luis Obispo. About
a hundred depositors were present and

depositors sufficient stock to admit them
to a directorate and see for themselves
how the affairs are being managed. It was
urged that the depositors hold off as long
as possible.
Steinhart and Koshland. directors of the
local defunct bank, will probably remain
till Monday, when it is expected that the
directors will consult with a committee of
the depositors about ways and means of
reopening the bank. A. F. Hortsman of

New Corporation in San

Special Dispatch to The Call
REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 20.â Articles of
incorporation of the Consolidated Light
and Power Company have been filed with
the County Clerk of San Mateo County.
The purpose for which the company is
organized is to engage in the business of
manufacturing, generating and purchas
ing gas, electric current and electric en
ergy for light, heat, power and traction
work In all municipalities and counties
of the State and distributing and selling
the same to the inhabitants.
The corporation is to run for fifty years
and the principal place of business is
San Francisco. The capital stock of the
company is $500,000 and the number of
shares 50,000. with a par value of $10.
Fifty dollars of the capital stock has
been subscribed.
The following directors have been elect
ed for the year: Robert J. Davis, Marin
County; E. M. Pease, Palo Alto; C. E.
Green, San Mateo; A. Poniatowski, San
Francisco; J. E. Green, San Francisco.
It is understood that the company has
bought the current of the Standard Elec
tric Company, which is to be brought
from tho Blue Lakes and distributed by
the former in several counties of the
State. The distributing stations in this
valley will be San Mateo, Redwood City,
Palo Alto and San Jose.
Prince Poniatowski is the principal
stockholder in both companies.
Some time ago the Standard Electric
Company applied to the Board of Super
visors for a franchise of fifty years to
run their wires through the county. Many
of the citizens of the county protested
against the placing of such a dangerous
element upon the public highways, as it
was generally supposed that the com
pany would use the county roads for the
purpose. The hearing has been continued
from time to time until yesterday when
a partial hearing was had, some of those
interested in the company being present.
The Supervisors asked as a concession
to the granting of the franchise that the
company furnish the county sufficient
power to maintain electric lights along
the highway.
This. It was explained, was impractica
ble for the reason that it would require
the building and maintaining of a second
and parallel system of wires, for the
power cannot be taken direct from the
main wires without going through trans
formers.
. Mr. Woods, attorney for the company,
stated that other counties had granted
franchises without concessions for sums
ranging from $50 to $100.
Further hearing on the petition was
continued for one month, at which time
action will probably be taken. â¢

arisen here and the jute mill authorities
can see no way to meet it.
Charles Walden. the Jute mill clerk, has
within the last few days received orders
for over 10.000.000 grain bags and the ut
most output of the jute mill is 13."00 bags.
A recent order of the authorities states
that no more than _0Â»> bags shall be pur
chased by any one buyer, and this is a
cut from a former order specifying 5000
as the number purchasable. The reason
given for the extraordinary demand is
that the farmers find it cheaper to pur
chase their sacks at the prison than In
the open market, as the prison is allowed
only lcent of profit per bag.
At the directors" meeting, which will be
held on Monday, the question will be con
sidered, and it is probable tuat the price
of grain bags will be raised.

T NTEREST in the northern gold fields is increasing so
I rapidly and the demand for better berths is so great
I that the Alaska Exploration Company has been forced
I to charter the big steamer Zealandia for the Cape
Â¦*Â¦ Nome and St. Michael run during the summer. The
report that the steamer had been chartered for Alas
ka was a surprise to shipping men. who believed that nona
but the smaller class of craft w.ould be used, as in former
years. The Oceanic Steamship Company only consented
after much negotiation to lease its splendid steamship
for the summer.
According to present arrangements the Zealandia will
leave early in May and will go direct to Cape Nome. Her
arrival will be so timed that she will land her passengers
at the first possible opportunity, so that they can take
advantage of the earliest chance to prosecute their search
for gold. The Zealandia /m\l go from Cape Nome to St.
Michael, at which point the voyage to Dawson and all in
termediate point^on the Yukon River will be continued in
the company's fleet of river boats. The fast time that can
be made by the Zealandia will make this route the quick
est between San Francisco and the gold centers.
The Zealandia is the largest and best equipped steam
ship ever in the Alaskan trade and can carry nearly 700
passengers. Her cabin berths will accommodate 175, thero
Is ample room fo>- 150 second-class passengers, while 300
can find ample quarters in the steerage. With her electric
light system and superb main saloon, which will seat 150,
the Zealandia presents a strong contrast to most of the
boats that were put into the northern service last yetir
and the year before, many of which met with accidents
involving great loss of life. The chartering of the popu
lar ocean liner marks the beginning of a new departure
in northern trade. It is the signal that the period of ex
citement and adventure has passed and that the Alaskan
gold tileds are now acknowledged. to offer great opportu
nities for legitimate enterprise and investment.
Although quite a fleet of smaller vessels are sched
uled to leave In advance of the Zealandia. her charterers
claim that she will be first on the field and that her pas
sengers will not be required to stay on board, under un
pleasant conditions, till work is possible. In addition to
every possible facility the Zealandia will also carry a phy
sician, and the trip will be made under conditions as
pleasant as any that prevail on any old-established route
of steamship travel.
The Zealaniia will make three and probably four round
trips during the season for the Alaska Exploration Com
pany, her charter covering the limit of time at which it
will be possible to make a successful trip to Cape Nome.
On the ways In the city there Is now being built a
tugboat for Cape Nome, which is owned by the charterers
of the Zealanaia. The new boat has been christened the
Meteor and wili be ready for launching in a few weeks,
after which she will at onro go north for service in the
lighterage and towing business at the Cape.

Mare Island Bill Passes
the House-
bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â
The House to-day passed tho Senate bill
changing the material for the building
of a drydock at Mare Island from timber
to stone or concrete.
Representative Metcalf, who first sug
gested this change to the Naval Affairs
Committee, has beta handicapped from
the fact that the Pennsylvania delegation
insisted that the bill should be for the
purpose of changing the material of
League Island dock only. After hearing
tho arguments the committee decided on
appeal of Mr. Metcalf that the Mare Isl
and navy yard was of as much import
ance, if not more, than that of League
Island. The committee provided that the
bill should declare a change of- material
for clocks at both yard?. Mr. Metcalf
to-day convinced the House that the
change of material was. necessary and
called attention to the fact that repairs
on a stone drydock only called for $4543,
while those on timber structured docks
called for $426,000. The bill will now go
to the President, and as the time of tnc
contract expires on February 13, there is
no doubt but that he will approve the
measure at once. â¢
Mr. Krusi of the Atlantic. Pacific and
Gulf Company, which has the contract for
the construction of the dock at Mare Isl
and, said yesterday that the success or'
the attempt to have the dock changed
from timber to stone had been anticipat
ed. All the experience of the naval au
thorities had been that the rtone docks
were cheaper to maintain, safer and more
durable. What work had been done at
Mare Island for the dock would not be
thrown away, as it consisted only of a
huge excavation about 700 feet long. This
would be utilized.
The change of materials would cause an
increase in the initial cost of the dock,
but it was a measure of economy and util
ity in the long run, and was an assurance
of the safety of the large naval . vessels
that may be put into the. dock. The ex
perience at the Brooklyn navy yard,
where a dock failed when a battleship
was in it, indicated that the timber docks
were â¢ unreliable and also unsafe. There
would be general satisfaction over the
action of Congress

After a week remarkable for the few
arrlral- of deep water ships, a whole fleet
cppe_red off port iibout sundown Uvst
evening. For three days t lie pilot bout
America was off the Karulloncs and not a
tail was sighted during the whole cruise.
The only incident worth recording was
tho remarkable catch of rockcod made
by Pilot lYfcman while the pilot boat vias
hove to off the Cordcll banks, lie hauled
them up three and four at a time, }Â»nd
at the end <>f an hour had caught 115 lish,
cr an average of nearly two a minute. No
sooner did the America come into port
than the ?hips began to appear on the
htirizon. ?o the pilots had to put on their
f^a clothes again and start on another
cruise. In all seven vessels came in, and
there was not a pilot left outside in con
sequence.
Among the fleet that came in during the
evening were the Kritish ship Kelburn,
150 day* from L,ondon; American ship Ta
foma. 91 d^ys, and steamer Conemau;h,
25 days from Manila; British phip Gen

ltoin Swansea. The latter- vessel beats
the Pass of Kllliecrankie and Kmiiie Gal

is brine paid on her. The Galline is out

f.!id .-fvjM-cl at Honolulu on the way. She
v.as only detained at Manila twelve days
diseharÃirp her carfro and then started
1 ack for San Francisco. Her long passage
home was due to heavy weather and con
trary winds.
The Conemaujrh came home via Naga
saki. She left the latter port December
_1 and has therefore been twenty-six d^-s
making the run across the Pacific. Soon
after leaving Napasaki she ran into wry
heavy weather and the ship, being light
rolled considerably. She was caught in a
typhoon, and at one timÂ«- it looked as
liurash the vessel would go down. Just
before the hurrkane broke Captain Rob
erts of iho Conemaugh sighted the Taco
ma. and judging from his own experience
he m:?de sure the ""wind Jammer" had
gone down with all hands. On his arrival
here he was prepared to report the prob
able loss of the Taeoma with all lianas,
but the first vessel he spoke off the Far
allones was the Taeoma herself, with all
well on board. Captain Pedersen "smelt"
the typhoon coming, and packing on all
sail ran away irom it.
Captain Pedersen reports leaving Manila
on October _. and did fairly well unz.il
November 2. Then a strong northea -t
monsoon struck the ship, and for three
days she was driven back. After that
*he had variable winds from north-north
e*l to cast-southeast, which lasted for
s-ixty-ssever. days. From January 6 to 11
t-he was in a southeast gale, during which
tiie barometer was down to _S.S6. and the
ship v/as hove to under a goose-winged
lowrr topsail.
The Conemaugh was in the same gale
as th<? Taeoma. and her officers measured
the waves, which they found to be sixtv
l\\f feet high. The steamer, being light
was thrown from the top of one wave
to another, bo it can be imagined what a

JURY ACQUITS
CAPTAIN MILLS
Was Justified in Killing
O'Melveney.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Jan. 20.â Captain
Frederick J. Mills, late Lieutenant Gov
ernor of Idaho, was to-day acrjultted of
the charge of murder. The jury was out
only a quarter of an hour, just long
enough to elect a foreman and take a bal
lot.
Such a finding was expected by every
one, and the announcement of the result
was not followed by anything sensational.
Captain Mills was charged with the
murder of John C. O'Melveney, chief en
gineer of the Oregon Short Line in this
city on October 3 last. The evidence
showed that while the defendant was ab
sent, serving as an officer in the volun
teer army of the United States, his wife
and O'Melveney became criminally Inti
mate. The defendant learned of these
facts on the day of the tragedy, his wife
making a full confession. The killing fol
lowed.
The defendant pleaded the Utah statute
which justifies the net of a husband who
kills his wife's seducer, and also set up
the plea of Insanity.

Almost from childhood Ruskin was
physically weak, but his extraordinary
mental energy kept his body under con

plished an amount of literary work that
would have killed many a man of far

At Oxford in 1542 Rusklri graduated, hav
ing won the Wendigate prize for English
poetry three years before. He at once
commenced the- indulgence of his taste for
art and four years later published tho
first volume of "Modern Painters." which
nevertheless he added nothing to his rep

ject which he had studied but little.
An episode in his career which s-U nil

same time it admired him. was his will.
He disposed of many royal gifts to pri
vate enterprises and public charities. He
owned the most remarkable variety of
treasures to be seen in any private house
in England.
Hr virtually named himself as his own
executor and proceeded as such to carry
out the provisions of his will. For thir
teen years he spent annually nearly $30,
000, including in that the Indulgence of a
property worth fully a million, which he
as good as gave away, as he did a par
doned debt 'of $G5,000 to a cousin, besides
making nnte-mortem bequests of larger
sums to other kindred.

How to Care for Young Palms.
A subscriber risks for Information re
garding the care of young palms. I would
suggest that a soil composed of one-rial f
common garden soil, the remainder equal
parts of well rotted manure, leaf mold,
sand and finely chopped soil, all thor
oughly mixed, be used for potting the
palms. Water only as often as the soil In
the pot appears to become somewhat dry â
not dust-dry, but showing a small amount
of moisture leftâ then apply the water
liberally. Keep the plant out of direct or
strong sunlight, which has v tendency to
make the foliage of a light color. "The
plant should not. however, bo consigned
to a. dark corner, but be kept in good
light and where there Is plenty of good
fresh air and no drafts. The leaves, es
pecially the tinder surfaces, should be
sponged at least once a week with tepli
water made slightly soapy. This will pre
vent the attacks of scale Insects, so often
troublesome- If any scale Insects should
appear, however, they may be removed

mission appointed by the Federal party,
which arrived in this country, was heard.
These gentlemen were all for free trade
with the United States, wanted a Terri
torial form of government, desired United
States currency as the standard and
wanted a loan authorized. Most of them
favored an extended suffrage and believed
that under the United States laws fair
elections could be held.
Henry Oxnard of Nebraska argued
against free trade because of the effect it
would have upon the beet r.ugar Interests.
Hill of Louisiana, representing the cane
sugar growers, took the Â»ame view. Frye
of Connecticut opposed free trade on ac
count of the effect upon tobacco interests.
Herbert Myrick made a general argument
against free trade between the United
States and Puerto Rico because of the ef
fect It would have upon the agricultural
interests of the United States.

AN OBJECT LESSON
In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the query: Have you
never notlcf-d In any large restaurant at
lunch or dinner time the large number of
hearty, vigorous old men at the tables;
men whose ages run from 60 to SO years;
many of them bald and all perhaps gray,
but none of them feeble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle is so common as
to have escaped your observation or com-
ment, but nevertheless it Is an object les-
son which means something.
If you will notice what these hearty old
fellows are eating you will observe that
they are not munching bran crackers nor
gingerly picking their way through a
menu card of new f angled health foods;
on the contrary they seem to prefer a
juicy roast of beef, a properly turned loin
of mutton, and even the deadly broiled
lobster Is not altogether ignored.
The point of all this la that a vigorous
old age depends upon good digestion and
plenty of wholesome food and not upon
dieting and an endeavor to live upon
bran crackers.
There Is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee and
many other good things are rank poisons,
but these cadaverous, sickly looking in-
dividuals are a walking condemnation of
their own theories.
The matter in a nutshell is that if the
stomach secretes the natural digestive
juices in sufficient quantity any whole-
some food will be promptly digested; if
thÂ« stomach docs not do so. and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal will
remove all difficulty, because they supply
just what every weak stomach lacks,
pepsin, hydrochloric acid, diastase and
mix.
Stuartls Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and In fact are not
strictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting It
thoroughly and thus gives n much needed
rest and giving an appetite for the next
meal.
Of. people who travel nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing
them to be perfectly safe to use at any
time, and alsu huvkr-r found out by ex-
perience that theA- are a safeguard
a gainst indigestion in any form, and eat-
hiK as they nave to. at all hours and all
kinds of food, the traveling public for
years have pinned their faith to Stuart's
Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 "cents for
full sized packages and any druggist from
Maine to California. If his opinion wero
asked, will *ay that Stuarfs Dyspepsia
Tablets Is the most popular and success-
ful remedy for any stomach trouble.

WILL LEASE LAND
FOR THE CANAL
Central America Sends
Assurances.
CHICAGO. Jan. 20.â A dispatch to the
Chronicle from Washington says the
State Department has received assurances
from Cohta Rica and Nicaragua that they
are willing to lease territory to the United
States for I<X> years or 200 years if neces
sary for the construction of the Nicara
guan canal.
This definite assurance absolutely re
moves any doubt that may have existed
as to the agreement of a treaty between
the United States and Costa Rica and
Nicaragua by which the absolute control
of the canal shall be vested in the United
States.
The State Department will proceed , to
make the formal treaty with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica as soon as -the bill has
been passed by Congress, but in the mean
while it is expected that there will be
further notes discussing the treaty be
tween the Governments in advance of the
actual passage of the bill and its signa
ture by the President.
It was stated to-day at the department
that Nicaragua had consented to arbitrate
its differences with the maritime com
pany, which holds that its concession,
while It nominally expired October 13 last,
is still in force under certain clauses of
the agreement. While this matter is ad
mitted to arbitration it was stated at the
department that it would have no ef
fect or delay in the negotiations between
the United States and the two Central
American republics.

Judged by little standards, and this
chapter is one which includes his married
life. When Ruskin was young and al
ready famous he met one evening at a
dance in London a most beautiful girl.
The hostess, pointing her out to him, told
him that he should marry her.
Ruskin, so say his critics, was too en
amored of the beautiful In art to fall in
love with a beautiful human being, but
however that may be, he married the girl
and gave her a magnificent home. After
a time John Ruskin brought Millais, tho
painter, to his home and asked him' to
paint his wife's portrait.
Millais was then a man of the most
superb physique, broad shouldered, deep
chested and with great length and
strength of limb. While he was painting
the portrait he fell in love with, his
friend's wife and the wife fell in love with
him.
Ruskin saw the unfolding of this ro
mance, which might easily grow into a
tragedy. His wife loved him no longer.
There was neither accusation, nor blame
for her, but he secured a. divorce and then
one fine morning walked into church with
his late wife and Millais and stood by
while they were married.
The painter Millais became the leading
artist in England, and the beauty of his
wife one of the charms of London society.
It is said that most of the unhappiness
which fell upon the last twenty years of
Ruskin's life owed its origin to this dis
appointment. Vet the great writer out
lived both Sir John and Lady Millais.
It was in ISS6 that the first symptoms of
any breaking down of Ruskin's mind be
came apparent. It was at Oxford, where
he was delivering a lecture, lie suddenly
became incoherent on the platform and
greatly exercised the feelings of a sym
pathetic audience. From that time till
his death Ruskin's great mind has been
under a cloud, and at times he has given
way to fits of violence. In 1393, as a mark
of honor to his genius. W. E. Gladstone,
then Prime Minister of England, offered
Ruskin the position of poet laureate, but

INDIANS WILL
VISIT CONGRESS
Want the Money Prom
ised Their Tribes.
Special Dispatch to The Ca
SPOKANE. Jan. 20.â Three of the most
famous Indian chiefs of this part of the
Northwest left here this morning for
Washington. D. C. where they will en
deavor to have the Government carry out
the agreement made in the Colville treaty
of ISSI, by which the tribes were to be
paid $1,500,000 for surrendering part of the
reservation. The trio consists of Lot,
head chief of the Spokanes of the' Spokane
reservation; Barnaby. head chief of the
Colvilles. and Or-Paug-Han. head chief of
the Lakes, from the Oolvllle reservation.
Major A. M. Anderson, thu agent in
charge of the reservation, and two half
breed Indian Interpreters accompany the
party East. These three chi*>ts have the
unique distinction of being the only lead
ers of Northwestern tribes -who would not
permit their bands to take pan in any of
the bloody -wars which were waged
against the early vhite settlers of this
Â«ectlon. T
In 1500 Congress authorized a, commis
sion to visit the tribes and make a treaty
for the ceding of the north half of the
Colville reservation. This commission met
the Indians and agreed that if the north
half be surrendered the Government
would pay $1,500,000 and apportion the
south half pro rata among the Indians.
Congress refused to ratify this treaty.
Since by act of Congress the entire re
serve has-been opened to mineral entry,
the Government has agents at work al
lotting but lm acres each to the Indians
and is preparing in the near future to
throw the remainder of the reservation
open to public settlement.

was politely declined by the principal
members of the Democratic Central Com
mittee.
Mr. Bryan came over from Washington
in a special car. accompanied by a com
mittee under the leadership of S. S. Field,
chairman of the committee on arrange
ments. Upon reaching this city the party
drove to the Eutaw House for dinner,
after which they went to Music Hall. At
the conclusion of Mr. â¢ Bryan's address

CARELESS WITH HIS MONEY.
Louis Brown, a tailor at 220 McAllister
Btreet, received a suit of clothes to be
cleaned and pressed yesterday afternoon.
The owner did not leave his name or ad
dress, but said he would call for the suit
on Monday or Tuesday.
When Brown went through the pockets
preparatory to cleaning the suit ne was
astonished to find four $100 bills and a $20
gold piece In one of the trousers pockets.
At first he was puzzled to know what to
do with the money, but finally consulted
his next-door neighbor, T. J. Clancy, , the
saloon-keeper. Clancy told of his experi
ence a few months ago in a similar case
and advised him to give the money into
the custody of Captain Seymour at the
City Prison, which was done.
There may be some mystery about the
money, but It Is probable that the owner
of the suit had forgotten that he had left
it In his trousers pockets. At all events
he will be asked for an explanation when
he makes a demand for it on Captain Sey
mour.

CHINESE SLEUTH
SYSTEM PROVES
II FLAT FAILURE
Six Companies Alter
Some Defects.
SUEY SING LEADER IN NAPA
OFFICERS STILL GUARD RESI-
DEK"CE OF JUE BXTN.
*
One Thousand Highbinders Have
Been Driven From the City by
the Authorities Within
Four Days.
The Chinese detective system has thus
far proved a failure so far as the deten
tion or prosecution of criminals is con
cerned. Certain defects were altered at
a meeting of the Six Companies last even
ing, but the alterations may only have
the effect of abolishing the heathen sleuth
force altogether. Until the present lime,
however, it has had one good effect. In
conjunction with the efforts of the offi
cersâthat of driving the highbinders from
Chinatown and of placing the situation
Â¦well under control. Since the Chinese de
tectives commenced to operate with the
police they have been in the habit of
pointing out hatchetmen. but when the
parties they designated were in the hands
Â«jf the officers they have disappeared, and
the police have had no evidence on which
to hold their prisoners. In this respect the
system has been a failure.
Last night the Six Companies decided
thai the detectives giving information to
any officer must swear to a complaint
iijrair.st. the person whose arrest they
caused. Now the police are certain the
detective* will give up their jobs, as very
few Chinese care to be known as a prose
cutor of a highbinder. This provision was
made at the suggestion of the police, who
recognize how easily the system could be
abused. As in the days of the Paris Com
mune, one person could cause the arrest of
any of his enemies by simply making a
statement that they were lawbreakers.
Tew highbinders still remain within the
limits oi Chinatown. Most of them have
fled to the vegetable gardens near South
Kan Francisco, and others are hiding in
laundries about town or nave gone to the
interior of the State.
An opinion has been given that both of
the warring tongs are willing to settle
their trouble, but this is doubted, as the
Hop Sing tong is still emaxting under its
dÂ«.ieat, due to its rivals superiority in
numbers. About five hundred members
of t.ach tong are no longer seen on the
etieets. and the police fear for no mori
murdeis until after the holidays at leart.
The Chinaman arrested by Sergeant El
lis and posse as being >he president of the
Hop Sing tong is still in the tanks, itn-i
Captain Wittman still hopes to establish
his identity. Ihe man was pointed out
to the ]>olice as Wong Shi Shu by Chinese
detectives, and the police have reason to
believe that the Information they received
is correct, bxzt an atempt to prove the
man's identity was frustrated by the dis
appearance of the detectives. The oresi
Â«ient of the Hop Sing tong, Lum Yok Lip,
has been located in N'apa, and officers
Jeft San Francisco yesterday to arrest
him.
Two well-known highbinders, who were
arrested by Sergeant Duke and Officer
Connor on Friday night, had to be liber
ated yesterday on account of the failure
of Chinese detectives who gave the In
formation leading to their arrest to ap
jwar and furnish the officers with evi
dence.
Jue Bun, the contractor at 711 Commer
cial street, who pave the police Informa
tion that the building in which he resides
ivas likely to be destroyed, is still in fear
of his life and last night extra officers
were detailed to watch on the premises.
Bun selects about BuO Chinamen who will
â¢work for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany on Tuesday next and on, or even be
fore that day, he thinks that an attempt
Â¦will he made to take his life. It ap
pears that in selecting men he is likely to
be mere partial to one tong than to an
other and dissension arises. In past years
he has experienced the same difficulty,
but he claims that never before has he
had such strong reasons to suppose that
iin attempt will be made to take his life.
Dr. Gardiner, Chinese Inspector and in
terpreter for the Chinese Bureau, arrested
last Friday evening a Chinese woman
JiiimH Ng Choy for being unlawfully In
the United States, she not having been
able to produce her registration papers.
The woman was turned over to the cus

Charged With Grand Larceny.
Max Cohen, a messenger boy. was ar
rested yesterday afternoon and booked at
the City Prison on a charge of grand lar
ceny. A few weeks ago Cohen delivered a
note to Hugo Fritz, a barkeeper at the
Orpheum, purporting to have been writ
ten by Policeman Dan Sylvester. The note
requested Fritz to give the bearer $20, and
Sylvester's name was affixed to the end
of it. Fritz gave the boy the money and
he returned with it to the Rococo sa
loon, on Market street, where he claims
to have handed It over to the man who
sent him for it. A few days later Sylves
ter discovered that his name had been
fraudulently used, hence the arrest.
The Roll Must Be Called.
The City Attorney yesterday sent an
opinion to the Board of Supervisors that
under the charter no bill shall become an
ordinance nor resolution be adopted unless
finally passed by a majority of all the
members of the board and the vote be
taken by ayes and noes. The names of
the members voting for and against the
same shall be entered in the journal.
This does away with the rule of the for
mer board, under which the chair would
state that "if there are no objections the
resolution is adopted." The charter pre
scribes that the vote shall be taken as a
test by which to determine whether the
requisite number of members vote in the
affirmative.!

BEHIND the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. W. R. McÃobie by Judge Kerri

cles as Vira Evans, separated after a married life of seven years. Mc-
Robie heard nothing of his divorced wife during the long interval until he
arrived in San Francisco last week to play the "double" in "A Hot Old
Time" at the new Alhambra. Sunday night after the performance McÃobie.
in company with several members of the "Hot Old Time" company, dropped
in at the Olympla in time to hear the star musical act on the programme
that of Misses Chandler and McPherson. In the former McÃobie recognized
his former wife, and after recovering from his great surprise he waited
impatiently for the conclusion of the turn. He tktn hastened to meet Miss
Chandler in her dressing room, and soon the reconciliation was complete.
They both agreed that the separation had been a mistake and decided to
start all over again, hence the marriage yesterday morning. Mrs McÃobie
will return to her home in Chicago. McÃobie will reach Chicago in about
two months, where he will join his wife, who will travel with him in the
future.
TRINITY'S NEW RASTOR
ARRIVES IN THE CITY
DELEGATION OF VESTRYMEN
CROSSES BAY TO MEET HIM.
Distinguished Divine Who Has Held
Some of the Most Important '
Trusts in. the Country.
Rev. Frederick W. Clampett, the new
pastor of Trinity Episcopal Church, ar
rived In the city yesterday afternoon on
the overland and Is now staying at the
Occidental.
The distinguished divine was met across
the bay by a delegation consisting of Ves
trymen Colonel J. V. D. Middleton, Major
W. L. Hooper, Judge W. E. F. Deal, John
Landers and W. E. Dean, which escorted
him to his hotel and extended to him the
usual courtesies due a stranger within
our gates.
When seen last night Dr. Clampett said
that he had as yet formed no plans nor
could he give out anything for publication
until he had had an opportunity to meet
and consult with his congregation. He
was very tired after his long trip across
the continent and would not assume the
duties of his pastorate until a week from
to-day. He will be present, however, at? 1
the congregational convention which is to
be held in Trinity Church on Tuesday
next.
Dr. Clampett succeeds Dr. Cook as
pastor of Trinity, though Dr. Nansen has
been officiating since the latter gentleman
left for the East. As soon as Dr. Clam
pett has had time to settle upon a per
manent residence he will send for his wife
and family, who are now residing in
Bloomington, 111.
Rev. Frederick W. Clampett was born
of Scotch-Irish parents forty years ago
and was educated In the University of
Dublin, where he graduated in honors
in classics and literature. He was or
dained deacon by the present Archbishop
of Armagh, then the Bishop of Derry, and
shortly afterward came to the United
States. He was recommended by the late
Cornelius Vanderbilt to the assistantship
at St. Bartholomew's Church, New York
City, where for over four years he was
the afternoon preacher. While in that
church he was ordained priest by Right
Rev. Henry C. Potter, Bishop of >ew
York.
In 1SS8 he was called to Springfield, 111.,
where he formed a new parish and built
one of the largest churches of the diocese.
In 1891 he was called to take charge of
Trinity Church, Columbus. Ohio, and in
1892 was appointed rector of St. Peter's
Church, Baltimore, which charge he now
fills. St. Peter's Church is the largest
Episcopal church In Baltimore (a city of
620,000 people) and has the reputation of
having the largest congregation of any
Episcopal church in the city.
Trinity's new pastor has the reputation
of being one of the finest pulpit orators in
the United States, and his executive abil
ity has been signally demonstrated in his
administration of the affairs of St. Peter's
Church in Baltimore, which parish he has
practically made, raising it from compar
ative obscurity to a foremost place
among the Episcopal parishes of America.
SOUNDLY THRASHED BY
AN ANGRY BROTHER
COURSE OF TRUE LOVE DOES NOT
RUN SMOOTHLY.
The Marriage of Mamie Wineroth and
Joseph Coll Has Been for the
Present Indefinitely
Postponed.
The course of true love has. not run
smoothly in" the case of Joseph Coll, a
tailor, and Mamie "Wineroth, a pretty girl
living on Natoma street, near Fifth. They
were engaged to be married yesterday
morning, but Mamie's parents and her
brother Harry, who are bitterly opposed
to the match, prevented it.
Coll lives at 171 Seventh street, but
boards with Mrs. Greenfeld, 442>Â£ Natoma
street, where he met Mamie, who is only
17 years of age. Owing to the opposition
of her parents Mamie left home about a
week ago and Coll secured a room for her
at the Clifton House, Powell street. They
arranged to be married by a Justice of
the Peace yesterday morning and on Fri
day night Coll got Mrs. Greenfeld to go
with him and Mamie to buy the wedding
ring.
Mamie's big brother Harry had been
searching for her, and he stumbled
against the trio in front of the Clifton
House. He "didn't do a thing" to Coll
and when .he had concluded his efforts
Coll was a sight and Mamie and Mrs.
Greenfeld had disappeared.
Wineroth was arrested on the charge of
battery and Â¦ the cose - came up before
Judge Mogan yesterday. Mamie was
waiting. in the warrant clerk's offlce till
the case was called when her brother
walked in. .She screamed and fainted,
which caused a sensation in court. The
Judge ordered her to be taken into his
chambers until she revived and Harry
carried her bodily through the court to
the chambers. After she had revived the
Judge . called her up and threatened to
send her to Jail unless she would consent
to go home with her brother. She was
obdurate till her brother remarked that
Coll had boasted he had made the dress
she wore.
"I won't stand for that," she said, with
flashing eyes, "and will go home."
The Judge continued the hearing of the
battery case till Tuesday.

EXTRA SESSION
CAUCUS PLEDGE
IS NOW AMENDED
Majority of Sixty-One
Will Not Win.
REQUIRE FORTY-THREE VOTES
â¢
SIGNERS .TO THE AGREEMENT
SAID TO BE NUMEROUS.
Petition for a Special Session Is Not
Embodied in the Fledge
Now in Circula
tion. Â¦
A. caucus agreement to., govern Repub
lican members of the Legislature in the
event of an extra session was published
in The Call yesterday. The advocates of
the . caucus are not petitioning for- an
extra session, but arc simply signing a
pledge to follow a certain course in the
event of a special session.
Â¦ Many Republicans, fearing that a ma
jority of . sixty r one might in caucus be
permitted to name the party candidate
for Senator, suggested that the language
of the agreement should be changed,
hence the pledge was amended to read as
follows:
"We further agree to support and
vote for in the respective houses and
in joint assembly the candidate who
may be selected by such caucus so
constituted, but no candidate shall
be declared or considered the caucus
nominee, nor shall any signer of this
agreement be bound to vote in either
house, or in joint assembly, for any
candidate as the caucus nominee, ex
cept such candidate shallhave first
secured â¢ not less than forty-three
votes in such cases.
It Is known that several members of the
Legislature have signed the agreement.
Information comes to The Call from the
framers of the pledge that no member to
whom it has been presented for signature
has refused to sign.
At the regular session of the Legislature
fifty-five Republican members resolutely
opposed the election of D. 11. Burns. It is
believed that these legislators, represent
ing anti-boss sentiments, can be organ
ized for effective work in the direction of
caucus control. Leading Republicans who
predicted the success of Burns at the be
ginning of the Senatorial contest are now
confident that he cannot succeed.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
residents of the Hotel Nymphla will find
themselves In a bad state at the cbnclu
sion of the trial should the bouse be
proved to be one of 111 fame.
Among those who made such affidavits
were several merchants, and the police
will arrest them as vagrants on a statute
which provides that any person residing In
a house of ill fame is liable to imprison
ment.
The inmates of the Hotel Nymphla again
appeared in Judge Cabaniss' court yes
terday and the case of Lillian Dale, the
keeper, was selected for trial. Her case
was continued till Monday, when a de
murrer to the complaint will be argued. In
Judge Fritz's court the seven inmates
arrested during the last raid appeared and
the case of Minnie McLausrhlin was select
ed for trial after several objections by
her attorney had been overruled. The
case was continued till next Friday, to be
set for trial by jury.
TO AMERICANIZE CHINESE
Heathen Children Will Receive
Modern Educations.
An important feature of a recent meet
ing of the Chinese Merchants' Association
was the introduction of a resolution to
Americanize the Chinese youths now re
siding in the United States, and particu
larly San Francisco.
At present it is claimed by the mer
chants that comparatively few of the Chi
nese now residing in this city are ac
quainted with the American language,
much less American law. and that thus
far there seems to be a disposition on the
part of Chinamen to oblige their children
to walk in "trodden paths." while they
themselves show no desire to become in
formed upon American customs other
than those which affect them pecuniarily.
Now the merchants propose to encour
age the instructing of all Chinese children
in the English language and also their at
tendance at schools in the United States
instead of in China. An attempt will be
made to better their social condition and
to make them law-abiding citizens. The
existence of highbinder tongs and all that
is lawless will be discouraged and a re
gard for human life will be one of the
first principles the merchants expect to
instill in thHr hearts. A drill corpe will
be organized and the young cadets will be
trained by Wong Fook, a prominent mer
chant at the corner of Jackson and Du
pont streets.
Chinese Released.
Gee Ly, a restaurant proprietor at Sl6
Washington street, and Hong Gong Chow,
who were arrested Friday night by Ser
geant Duke, were released from custody
yesterday. Attorney Newburgh, on be
ing refused permission to see Gee Ly, ap
plied for a writ of habeas corpus before
Judge Cook, but before it was issued he
received notification. from the police that
his client had been released.

22I BELIEVE in dancing and a long list of other things that are
tabooed by church-goers when indulged in by ministers. If a man
needs a drink he has the right to take it. When I meet a man on
the street I like to slap him on the back and say "Hello there, Bill,"
in a good hearty voice. I believe in God and Christianity, but tha
church is burdened with false ideas and full of sinful hypocrites,
and some of my friends who might bÂ© called "lushers" are infinitely
better than these frauds of piety. â These are the startling reasons
given by the Rev. James C. Maclnnes. for many years pastor of a Con
gregational church in Oakland, and one of the organizers of the Chris
tian Endea%or work in this county, for resigning from his church and
going out of the ministry.
To the trustees of his church he said: "The ministry Is no place
for a young man who wants his personal liberty. HÂ© must use too
much hypocrisy and overlook too much hypocrisy In others."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway, Jan. 20.
THE Rev. James C. Maclnnes, one
of the best-known young divines
In Alameda County, has renounced
the ministry under the most start
ling circumstances. He was con-
sidered a most promising young minister,
who had consecrated his life to the cause
of religion, and now that he has thrown
up his charge in the most summary man
ner his acquaintances are thunderstruck.
For two years he was pastor of Oak
Leaf Congregational Chapel, in the aris
tocratic part of this city, and was prob
ably the most prominent Christian En
deavor worker In Oakland. The perfect
organization of that society In Alameda
County Is largely due to his efforts.
After being connected with the Oak
Leaf Chapel for two years the youns
minister accepted a ca"ll to the Congre
gational church at Benicia. He was very
successful there and was pastor of that
church for sixteen months. Last week he
told his congregation that he would leave
the ministry lorever on the following
Sunday. People did not know what to
make of it, and conjectures Sew from
the mouths of everybody. When ac
quaintances asked for an explanation it
was not forthcoming.
Rev. Mr. Maclnnes went before the trus
tees of his church and presented his res
ignation. In doing so no made the fol
lowing statement:
"A man must be a hypocrite and over
look hypocrisy In others to remain in the
ministry and be successful. Besides, I
consider myself better equipped for a
business than for a religious career."
The story of his - sudden change flew
from mouth to mouth among those who
knew him, and to say that it created a
sensation Is to put It very mildly. Then
the story of his life became known â how
he sacrificed a fortune to enter the min
istry â and this is the story of his reasons
for leaving the church and the story of
his life as told by Rev. Mr. Maclnnes
himself:
"I believe In dancing," he said, "and a
long list of other things that are tabooed
by churchgoers when indulged in by min
isters. If a man thinks he needs a drink
he has a right to go and take it. In fact.
I am "a hale fellow well met,' as the say
ing goes, and when I meet a friend on the
street who is a good fellow himself I like
to slap him on the back and say 'Hello,
there. Bill!' in a good, hearty voice. All
this is looked upon as wrong by every
body when it is done by a' clergyman, and
I am sick of the whole thing.
"The church is burdened with false
ideas. The members of the congregation
want their pastor to be solemn visaged
and dignified always. This compels a
minister to oftentimes assume a false
dignity. Clergymen are human and have
the same feelings as other people. Their
tastes are the same, but they are prevent
ed from indulging them because if they
did so it would cause their dearly beloved
parishioners to hold ud their hands In
horror. A short time ago I went to a
dance given for young Fred Reuger, a
friend of mine, who was going away, and
the matter kicked up a terrible row. For
a long time before that I had been think
ing seriously of leaving the ministry, and
that event brought me to a decision.
"Of course I believe in God and In
Christianity, but I do not believe In many
professed Christians who pray several
times a day. The church la full of sin
ful- hypocrites, and some of my friends
who might be what people commonly
term 'lushers' are Infinitely better than
these frauds of piety.
"In leaving the ministry I do so with
dear into the balance. They have
much to lose and much to gain in the
good or evil opinion of the people of
San Francisco. By the fortune of
political success they have been
chosen to decide whether the people
of this city are to be the victims of
plunderers and the vicious or
whether justice and protection shall
be given and municipal purity shall
reign. Is it possible that the Com
missioners can mistake the road to
which the finger of public duty is
pointing ?
THE INVESTIGATION
Before the
POLICE COMMISSION
THE investigation of the charges
against Frederick L. Esola was
completed last ni?ht by the Police
Commissioners, who reserved their
decision until they had thorough!y
weighed the testimony brought out at the
Inquiry.
If any proof were lacking to snbstan
tlate the charges that Mayor Phelan had
entered into a despicable plot to deliver
the Police Department into the handu of
the blacklegs and criminals of the city it
was supplied yesterday by the evidence
brought out at the investigation. It was
forced from the lips of the man who la
accused of a desire to control the police
for the purpose of levying blackmail
upon all who desire to engage In unlaw
ful undertakings within the precincts of
the city.
There was testimony to the effect that
Mayor Phelan had arranged a meeting of
the new Police Commissioners at his of
fice In the City Hall on the Sunday fol
lowing their appointment for the purpose
of consummating his pre-election deal with
Andrew M. Lawrence to place him In
control of that branch of the city govern
ment which has to do with enforcing the
law and keeping the peace, the appoint
ment of Esola as Chief being part of the
bargain.
By the admissions of Lawrence It was
shown that Phelan had notified him of the
meeting and that he had taken Esola
there with Instructions to remain In the
ante-room until he was wanted. Esola
was questioned on the same subject mat
ter before the confession was forced from
Lawrence. He was taken by surprise and
this man who aspires to be Chief of , Po
lice of San Francisco could not remember
what had occurred but a couple of weeks
previously.
The facts were hinted at during the ex
amination of Esola by Attorney McGow
an, but the witness gave no direct an
swers. He took refuge behind the flimsy
subterfuge of a convenient loss of mem
ory. It was not until Lawrence was
called to the stand that the truth came
out. He brazenly acknowledged all alle
gations suggested by the drift of. the in
quiry.
During- the ' Investigation .Â« lt was also
brought out that Mayor Phelan had been
false to one "of his 'most ardent support
ers during the last campaign, had grossly

had abused the trust Imposed in him by
a friend.
When the Commissioners resumed the
Investigation yesterday, afternoon a num.
ber of unimportant witnesses were ex
amined before the sensational features of
the inquiry began to pop. Esola was re
called, and after a number of questions
tending to show his lack of educational
qualification, all of which were barred
out by Commissioner Thomas as spokes
man for the board. Attorney. McGowan
surprised the witness with the query
which follows:
"Were you present- at any meeting of
the Commissioners other than those for
the purpose of this Investigation?"
The ambitious lieutenant of police was
startled. He was perceptibly pained and
embarrassed by the trend the inquiry
threatened to take. He gazed appeallngly
at his attorney. Garret McEnerney, ana
his backer, Lawrence. He searched in
vain for an answer In the perplexed look
In their faces until finally, in a manner
that bristled with evidence of bluff, his
lawyer advised him to go on and tell all
he knew. It was then that Esola sneak
ed behind the excuse that his memory
failed him, and he saved himself from
telling things that he knew would throw
light on the nature of the plot to make
him Chief of Police.
This man who aspires to become the
head of one of the most important
branches of the city government could
not remember having attended a secret
meeting of the Commissioners, held
scarcely two weeks before. He claimed
that he was so "badly bothered and mixed
up" that he could not think, but his wits
told him, nevertheless, that a truthful an
swer would be fraught with danger to his
aspirations.
Mr. Lawrence was called later and evi
dently prompted by the apparent famil
iarity of the prosecution with the circum
stances, unfolded the details of the whole
shameful transaction. According to hts
testimony the meeting was . held at the
Mayor's office, Sunday. January 11. with
in twenty-four hours after the new Com
missioners had been named.
"I just happened to drop in," said Law
rence, in explanation of how it happened
that he was present at the meeting. The
words had scarcely left his lips when he
was forced Into a corner by a searching
examination and compelled to admit that
his presence at the meeting was not a.
matter, of accident, but that Phelan had
apprised him of what was coming off and
had advised him that it was a golden op
portunity to get in . some good work for
Esola.
"It was not a regular meeting of the
commission,", continued Lawrence. '.'The
members had .simply gathered to pay their
respects to the Mayor."" b~-~/r
Phelan knew that the "respects" were
coming, for he lost Â¦ no time In posting
Lawrence. Continuing, the witness said:
"I took Esola there and told him to wait
on the outside, and that if I wanted him
I would call him. I went to the meeting
for the purposo of promoting Esola's can
didacy and at the invitation of the Mayor.
I Introduced Esola to the Commissioners,
told them that he was my candidate and
that I hoped they would select him."
The Commissioners themselves did not
display any great joy at the position In
which they were placed by. the. admissions
of Lawrence, and their relief was notice
able when the probing process was discon
tinued.
A stenographic report of Lawrence's
testimony follows:
McGowanâ Mr. Lawrence, did you
ever attend; a meeting of this com
mission other than those they, held
for the purpose of investigating these
charges ? " ' . ' Â¦. '_-Â¦? .
AFTER a period of Inaction the suicidal cycle wave
struck the Morgue yesterday and kept the new
young deputies and the superannuated horses busy.
The Immediate cause of two of the deaths was
suicidal frenzy brought about by excessive indul
gence in alcoholic drinks.
The first case was that of Jacob Schutten, a baker,
who lived with his family In the rear of his bakery at 1834
Lyon street. Schutten had been confined to his bed since
last Tuesday evening with a high fever, and on Friday
became delirious. At 4 o'clock yesterday morning, while
the other inmates of the house, worn with watching, were
In a deep sleep, Schutten arose from his bed and, utter
ing a wild yell, jumped through a window In the tack
part of the house. The window overlooked a roof In
which was a skylight, and through the skylight the un
fortunate man plunged to his death.
Medical aid was at once summoned, hut in vain, for
Schutten died in a few minutes from loss of blood. The
body was taken to the Morgue and afterward to an un
dertaker's parlors. Schutten was 35 years old and a na
tive of Germany. He left a widow and three small chil
dren.
William Hollingworth, a miner from Alaska, ended his
life yesterday morning by swallowing a quantity of cya
r.:de of potassium in his room in the New Western Ho
teL . For the past three or four years Hollingworth had
been In the habit of coming down from Alaska and spend
ing the winter in this city. He had ,heep on a, spree for
several days, and was so drunk half* an hour- after mid
night yesterday morning that he fell In the hallway of'
the hotel and cut his face against the corner of a sew
ing machine. Night Clerk Joseph Evers took him up*
stairs to his room and put him into bed. When the bed
maker came around at 10:45 in the morning and received
no answer to his summons, he gave the alarm and the
door was forced open.
Hollingworth was lying in bed dead, and on a chair

THE SHAMEFUL STORY
OF THE MAYOR'S PLOT
Startling Revelations at the In
vestigation of Esola.
Phelan Sought to Honor His Bond Within
Twelve Hours After His Appoint
mentsâlnquiry Closed.
7 % HE investigation of the charges preferred against Police
Lieutenant Frederick L. Esola, alias Frederick Harrington,
who relies upon his affiliation with political hucksters and
criminals in high places to elevate him to dangerous and un
merited power, took a remarkable turn yesterday. The man zvho is
now on trial is not the presumptuous lieutenant, but the chief execu
tive of this city, Mayor Phelan, ighosc personal honor and official life
should be above reproach. The ambition of a newspaper man's body
servant has become an issue of minor importance in the investigation.
It is the Mayor who is now not only accused but convicted of malfeas
ance in efnee, of consorting and conspiring in the cheap arena of petty
politics to barter away control of the great institutions of this city.
It is Mayor Phelan zvho is being dragged through the political
mire of his own choosing. It is lie at whom the finger of public scorn
is pointing. It is he who is now cringing, zvhipped in humiliation at
the expose of his duplicity, of his contempt of the lazvs that honorable
men respect, of his violation of promises, of his guilty, ante-election
compact to make of the Police Department of this city a gigantic po
litical machine and a menacing engine of ill-gotten gain for gam
blers, ponderers and thicz'cs.
LASHED INTO THE NAKEDNESS OF
A DISHONORED TRUST.
The investigation before the Police Commissioners rci'caled
yesterday that Mayor Phelan has stooped to the dishonorable act of
betraying a private confidence; that he is party to the contemptible
practices of a clique of unscrupulous schemers who have made out of
the sacred relationship of motherhood a commodity with which to buy
and sell sympathetic votes. The inquiry has lashed the Ma\6r into
the nakedness of a dishonored trust, exposing him to the odium of
men who believe that public officers should be above purchase and be-
In the testimony of A. M. Lawrence, given yesterday, it teas
shown that Mayor Phelan, within twelve hours after his announce
ment of the Police Commission, summoned Lawrence and Esola to
his office to meet with the Commissioners and discuss with them the
compact to make Esola Chief of Police. That meeting zvas held and
Esola was introduced by Lawreiue as "my candidate for Chief of
Police." He was not Mayor Phclcn's candidate, for his Honor had
sold his right to a candidate. He had been bought, and he had to
pay ihe price.
There in his office on the afternoon of Sunday, January 7, zvhen
efneial business was suspended, zvhen the Police Commission had
not even organized, the guilty Mayor zi'as ready to honor his con
temptible bond. He was eager to meet the shafts of contempt and see
the sneers of decent men that quickly he might fulfill the criminal con
tract which places him in- the category of recreant officials zvho arc in
spired by nothing but an unworthy ambition, corruptly satisfied.
The inquiry has reached this serious magnitude. It has proved
in the sworn testimony of the conspirators themselves that the Police
Commissioners were named by Mayor Phelan without thought of or
consideration for public policy; that they were chosen by the Mayor
solely to consummate a felonious compact made to secure newspaper
influence; that they were summoned by the Mayor in greedy haste
to meet the man tliey were pledged to make Chief of Police.
THE SUCCESS OF THE PLOT WOULD
BE A CRIME.
This is now the issue of tl%e inquiry, and if the Commissioners
are net satisfied with the evidence produced let them induce Mayor
Phelan to sue The Call for libel, and this paper will supply other
proofs. Let the Commissioners prevail upon his Honor to take the
step that an honest man, stung by injustice, would need no urging to
take. Let the Commissioners beg the Mayor to defend his name, and
The Call will furnish facts that will warrant impeachment.
As for Esola, it is difficult to understand how he can still be an
object for serious consideration in connection with the position
which his friends have bought for him from Mayor Phelan and in
which he is to be a complaisant, conniving figurehead, winking at
crime and official corruption. His own testimony convicts him of ig
norance and inexperience and gross neglect in the performance of
duty. He has saddled himself with an alias, has been dismissed
from one post of responsibility, has beat pushed forward to others
because of the crooked deals his sponsor has made with Dan Burns,
the personification of disease in politics, and with these recommenda
tions h} demands that some of the most vital interests of this city be
placed in his hands. The idea is preposterous; the accomplishment
of the plot would be a crime against the people of San Francisco.
ESOLA'S CUNNING SERVED BET
TER THAN HIS MEMORY.
When Esola zvas on the stand he was asked to relate some of the
incidents of the conference held in Mayor Phelan' s office on January
/. The witness could not remember. His memory could not serve
him faithfully for two weeks. He knew better than others the con
sequences of telling the truth. His cunning served him better than
his memory, and will it not serve him as well when in the perform
ance of a sacred public duty he must choose betzecen temptation and
justice, between the invidious attacks of blacklegs, moral filth pan
derers and thirjes and the property and lives of honest citizens?
It is a public outrage to consider his zvorsc than presumptuous
claims. Rather than seeking promotion he should be striving to pre
vent the fall of the official ax that will remove him from the position
in which he is already a menace. The Commissioners have now the
evidence before them. In accepting their trust they have placed
tiiansclvcs on trial. They have thrown their honor and all they hold
regret, because when I entered It I did
so with the Intention of making It my Ufa
work. Now my hopes are blasted. I see
that I made a mistake in not entering
some other field of labor when I was a
youth, full of energy and with everything
before me.
'"When I determined upon a career In
the church I sacrlriced a fortune. Incurred
the unrelenting hatred of my father and
have misapplied the ten best years of my
life. My rather was a wealthy manufac
turer of Philadelphia, and beside th*
deathbed of my mother I was induced by
misguided friends to determine upon tha
ministry as my vocation.
"When I told my father of my deter
mination he became furious. I was ob
durate, and although I was but 14 years
of age at the time he ordered mo from tha
house. Until he died, several years ago.
he never recognized me again. I went
forth Into the world a homeless boy and
by dint of hard work and much saving I
managed to get together enough money
to enable me to take a course at Amherst
College, In Massachusetts. Then I went
through the Theological Seminary of Chi
cago, graduating from there In 1534. After
that I came to California, and after a
special course of several months at tha
Pacific Theological Seminary I was or
dained a minister and took charge of Oak
Leaf Chapel.
"I stayed there a coupleof years and thfn
accepted a call from the Congregational
Church at Benicia. There I stayed until a
week ago. when I decided that the minis
try was not the place for a man who
could not hide his identity under a clonk
of false dignity. I have many friends In
the churches of Oakland and Benicia, and
I leave them with regret. The only par.g
that my severance from the ministry
gives me. however, comes from the fact
that I delayed it so long.
"I shall now enter upon a business ca
reer and a life of personal liberty. My
endeavor shall be to be a Christian.busi
ness man. By embarking in a mercantile
life and doing unto' others as I woiilil
have them do unto me. I think I can do
more good than by remaining in tha pul
pit.
"Several people have started the rumor
that I was induced to take my presort
course by a young lady . to whom I am
engaged. Such Is not. the case. I am be
trothed to no woman, and am actuated
by what I consider the best possible mo
tives. I cannot countenance hypocrisy in
myself or in anybody else. The church is
filled with hypocrisy, and a minister it
compelled to overlook it; for that reason
I have become a layman.
"Vale,, hypocrisy! I can now walk down
the street with my hat on the back of my
head, my hands In my pockets, and when
I meet a genial friend I can say, 'Hello,
there, old man. how goes it?' without hav
ing people stare at me In astonishment.
I nave been rebuked by the looks of
churchgoers, who think a minister should
not act like other men, too long. Now
that I am free I feel as happy as a boy
going fishing. I have already made ar
rangements to embark in business in Chi
cago, and shall leave for that city next
Wednesday."
The ex-minister of the gospel evidenced
his appreciation of freedom by his ac
tions. While going down the street ha
acted like a politician looking for votes.
His hat was tilted backward, his thumb*
were ensconced in the armholes of hi*
vest, and acquaintances among young
fellows were greeted with a heartiness
that was rugged and genuine. Notwith
standing his departure from the ministry.
Mr. Maclnnes retains a host of warm
friends, who considered hlia justified in
pursuing the course he has taken.
To-day he bade good-by to his friends
In Benicia. He will stop at the residence
of Colonel W. S. Little at 3621 Broadway,
this city, until he takes his departure for
the East next week.

from the effect of his dissipation. At 9 o'clock yester
day morning the girl called at the flat >mn a basket of "
cooked food for Falen, and not receiving an answer to (
her summons, went on the back porch and peeped through

dead body hanging from the transom.
Falen had opened the transom over the door leading i
from the kitchen into the dining room and, standing on a
chair, tied one end of a piece of clothesline around the <
transom and the other end of the line around his neck.

"COMMIS VOYAGEURS"
ON A SEA OF TROUBLE
A CROWD CAME ON "COMPS" AND
EXCITEMENT RESULTED.
It Was Soon Over, However, and an
Immense Throng Joined in the
Dance and Made Merry.
"What a time the "Commis Voyageurs"
had last night getting their $3 admission
invitation masquerade ball In full swing!
But after it got started everybody had a
good time. By 10 o'clock the big Pavilion
was jammed with people, but they didn't
pay $5 to get in. Early In the evening 1 the
proud bearers of complimentary tickets
began to arrive and were graciously ad
mitted, but shortly afterward were, in
formed by E. L. Knapp, the pilot of the
"Voyageurs," that hat checks could be
procured for 50 cents each.
This made the holders of the "comps"
angry and as they began to thin out C.
Leonhardt, who held ihe bar privilege,
began to object and friends broke his
"embrace" with Knapp. Then everybody
came In, to tho disgust of the youngsters
who were selling tickets on the street at
50 cents each.
Finally those who had paid for hat
checks got the tip that others had re
fused to pay for the care of their head
gear, and another argument resulted.
In the meantime a committee went to
tho City Hall, got six policemen, and af
fairs thereafter were merry, save for a
minute when the band got tired and de
manded an explanation. Tho explanation
waa forthcoming and the maskers mingled
in the mazes 01 the march.
The crowd was the largest seen in the
Pavilion for many months, and even
though the tickets were "comps," those
who received them, or at least the ma
jority, were people well known in'the bet
ter walks of life. That rowdyism common
In the old-time Pavilion dances was ab
sent, and a pleasant time was enjoyed by
nil. except the management. Good order
might have been maintained throughout
the evening had it not been for the par
simony of the managers. Under the new
charter promoters of such entertainments
are required to pay Into the police pen
sion fund $2 50 for each policeman em
ployed In preserving the peace. Hence
the trouble. â¢

BEACON IS
FAVORITE AT
UNION PARK
The Curtis Greyhound Picked
to Win ths Big
Stake.
The run-down of the open stake and
of the eapling etake at Union Coursing
Park resulted in good sport. The dogs
were unusually well matched and the
strong hares took them all over the field.
It was essentially a favorite day. In the
sapling stake every favorite won, while
In the open stake the majority raised the
liag. The usual upset resulted over the
meeting- of Walt a Bit and Kock Island
Hoy. The latter was some four pounds
!iÂ£iu, but was installed favorite at 7 to 1.
To the surprise of the spectators Wait a
Bit led up and won by a score of 4 to 0.
Silver Wirgs beat Commodore at 3 to 3;
Rusty Gold beat Victor King at 2 to 5;
Forget beat Sleety Mist at 1 to 3.
Beacon has been installed favorite for
tho stake with Royal Flush, Lady Clare,
Wild Trake, Bohe, Daisy Clair, Lucky
L)og. Beauty Spot and Royal Anne in de
mand In that order. Lucky Dog showed a
brilliant dash of speed in his course with
Florence N. Wild Tralee was unsighted
for a moment in his course with E.
Geary's Ireland and It seemed he would
lose. He had the better of the latter part
of a good working course and won. Mac's
Melody ran well, as did Bohe. The usual
difficulty was experienced in catching
Jessamy, it requiring twelve minutes be
fore she would permit herself to be cap
tured after her course. She was then
withdrawn and will not run to-day. The

some ninety miles Into San Luis Obispo
County, where they, remained several
weeks, returning yesterday. The string
of dogs belonging to each is in good
form and groat things are expected from
the animais.
R. M. Dodge, handler for the Stockdale
Kennels, finished his training yesterday,
It was done mostly in the vicinity of
Lakeside, twenty miles from Bakersrieid.
The Stockdale Kennels' string is In tirst
class shape and should be heard from in
the various events to lake place next
week. Sams Bow, the winner of last
year's all-age stake, has almost recovered
from the injury to his leg, which handi
capped him so badly during the latter
part of the trials last year. The Stock
dale Kennels will have three Derby en
tries, three in the all-age and one or more
'" the champion stake.
W. B. Coutts has a very large string of
dogs, all in fair shape. He has more
Derby entries than any other handler
here, and if report be true there are some

been heard from for several days, bnt
there is little doubt that their dogs will all
be in good form on Monday.
There are a number of field trial en
thusiasts already on the ground. Among
them are A. Truman, H. T. Payne, W.
W. Van Arsdale, Messrs. Tiedeman and
Howe from Oregon and Washington
respectively, and Frank Holbrook of Los
Angeles. Among those expected to ar
rive to-morrow are J. E. Terry and C.
N. Post of Sacramento. J. Kilgarif.
Frank Maskey. Howard Black, Andrew
Jackson, Sam Hughes and a half-aozen
others from San Francisco, Henry T.
Kelly, John Schumacher and several
others from Los Angeles. Thomas John
son of Canada, who will act as Judge, la
expected to arrive some time to-morrow.
Although birds are somewhat scarce
throughout the country they are reported
fairly plentiful on the trial grounds,
which will be at the same place as last
year. The Stockdale ranch is situated
about four miles from Bakersfteld.
Lntnes for the Members' stake will be
to seven. W. S. Tevis, president of the
club, will run Nellie Wilson; Frank

HANDICAP
FOR ANDES
Faculty Committees Investigat
ing Professional Conduct
of Baseball Athletes.
James Arthur's Gcod Colt
Lands the New Orleans
Stake Event.
The baseball athletes of both the Uni
versity of California and Stanford are by
no means easy of conscience at the pres
ent time. An investigation has been
Ftarted by the professors at both Palo
Alto and Berkeley which, if consistently
adhered to, will probably result in barring
some of the best diamond material at the
colleges.
Soon after the football season closed the
professors who form the faculty athletic
committees at Stanford and California
gave out that spring athletics would be
put to a rigid test in order to wipe out
the meagerest taint of professionalism.
Both faculties have expressed themselves
positively in this regard, and ail show of
professionalism, even though it be but in
the letter and not in spirit, will receive its
death blow.
The work of investigation has gone on
at Berkeley and Stanford and the results
are feared by all the baseball men. Dur
inff the vacations many of the college
base runners played on country teams, re
ceiving some recompense for it, though
fmall and in many cases just sufficing to
pay the expenses of the player while in
the country town. There is hardly a dis
tinct case of professionalism at either
college, but the minor lapses from the
stringent ethics of the amateur status will
be met with the same punishment.
At Stanford the commotion excited by
the faculty's action is intense. Just when
the announcements will be made is not
known, but they are expected in a week
or two. The students show some signs of
rebellion at this supervisorial attitude the
professors have taken in the matter. They
claim that some notice should have been
given. Ihe contest between the student
committees and the faculty will be fought
out in joint meeting. The faculty com
mittees on student athletics will be asked
to pass some laws which will go into effect
next season, thus serving as a warning
and a notice at the same time that all
future infractions will receive summary
treatment.
A similar investigation will be made In
regard to track athletics, but as the vio
lations in this branch of amateur ath
letics are few and isolated not many sus
pensions are anticipated. There are a few
infractions in this branch of sport how
ever, and those athletes who have won
honors on athletic club teams and at the
same time received some form of com
pensation will be barred from participat
ing in the intercollegiate games this
spring.

ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL.
An Oakland Team Defeats the Vam
pires by a Good Margin.
The Oakland Association football team
met the Vampires yesterday afternoon at
the Presidio grounds for the second time
during. the present, season and defeated
them by three goals to one. The Oak
landers had the heavier eleven and their
team work was much better than that of
their opponents. The kick-off took place
at about 3:30 p. m., and during the first
half Erskine and Morse scored one goal
each for the Oakland team. The Vam
pires obtained one goal from a corner
kick by Williamson. Score: Oakland. 2
goals; Vampires, 1 goal. During the sec
ond half Bird kicked a third goal for the
Oaklanders, the game ending without
further score on either side. For the
winners Hunter and P. Chambers played
the best game, while O'Rourke, Macder
mld and Williamson rendered good ser
vice to the losers. The teams will meet
again two weeks from yesterday. The
line-up was as follows:
Vampires. Positions. Oakland.

SCHULTE
WEARY OF
TURF WAR
Resigns His Position as Presi
dent and Director of the
Congress.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Jan. 20.â William F.
Schulte. president of the American Turf
Congress, which controls all the racing
of thoroughbreds in the West, resigned
his position to-day. He resigned both as
president and director of the congress.
Schulte'a resignation Is the direct re
sult of the war between members of the
turf body regarding racing dates for this
spring and summer. He had called a
meeting of the Turf Congress for January
25 at Covington in order to settle the dif
ferences, but to-day he called off this
meeting, at the same time tendering his
resignation. Both communications were
telegraphed to Secretary Ed Hopper at
Cincinnati.
As the case now stands there will be no
meeting of the congress next Thursday
unless James Howard of the Washington
Park Jockey Club, Chicago, who Is vice
president of the congress, sees fit to call
such a meeting. This is not at all likely,
however, for Howard is one of those in
terested in the faction which has been
fighting Schulte, Applegate and Corrigan
The dissensions In the ranks of the Turf
Congress date back several months, when
President "Schlute first announced that a
meeting of the congress would be held
in order to decide an eauitable adjust
ment of racing dates for the coming
spring. The Chicago and St. Louis pro
moters gave voice to various murmurlngs
of disapproval and on several occasions
declared they would not accept any al
lotment of dates other than those they
desired to give. What they wanted, so
Schulte claims, was to gobble up all the
dates and to race all summer. Schulte
paid a visit to Chicago in December in
order to try to pacify the disturbing ele
ment, but he says he was coldly rec3ived
and was given to understand that the
three Chicago tracks would race to suit
themselves. When seen late to-night
Schulte said:
"I resigned this afternoon because I re
ceived word that the St. Louis and Chi
cago Jockey clubs were going to run their
meetings regardless of the wishes
of the Turf Congress. As a mat
ter of fact, this afternoon I re
ceived word that the representatives of
these clubs would not even attend the
meetings of the congress which I had
called for January 25 at Covington. Be
coming disgusted with the outlook, I sim
ply resigned and called the meetings off."

Mr. <jtjwdy took advantage of the occa

Jillment of his prophecy mado two years
previously, as t<> the Increase of commerce

Paris la H3'j. he paid, showed an increase
over those cf I^*o of 3l,<'Â«i,n<>o francs and
ever those of IS&4 of 0.1,3T4.0iXt francs. In

opinion that the export trade of the
Vr.it f-d States to France was only in its
Infancy and urged France and her peo
jjJe to buy American goods.
In the speeches many approving refer
ences were made to the reciprocity treaty
b*>tr.pen the two countries and the hope
of its ratification was frequently ex
pressed.
At the business meeting after the dinner
a resolution was adopted expressing hope
for the early ratification of the treaty by
both Governments and confidence in its
Tendency to increase the commercial re-
lations of the two republics. Professor
Woodward spoke briefly on the exposition.

OBJECT TO PARIS

American Commission
ers on the Warpath.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. ?>.â A Journal tpe>
cfal from Paris says: A prcat row is in
progress between the I'nited Staffs Com
missioners to the Paris Exposition and
the French authorities. Relations are
strained almost to the bre:ikins point.
The trouble is ever the fact that Tur
key Is permitted to erect her national pa
vilion far in front of the American pa
vilion. Despite the fact that the line of
demarcation of each national building is*
carefully drawn the Turkish pavilion
completely overshadows the American,
making the latter look like a racrp annex.
The United States Commissioners are
furious and declare that unless the Turkish,
building is moved back to its proper place
a rupture is inevitable. The first impulse
was to withdraw altogether, but prepara
tions had gone too far. The present plan
is to turn the dispute over to the Minister
of Foreisn Affairs.
The Frtnch authorities try to miniiniza
the question by pretending there is a dis
pute between the United States and Tur
key. The Commissioners ignore Turkey
and lasist upon justice from the FrenciJ
authorities.

IThere la evidence that within half an
hour after Older's departure from Phe
ian's office Lawrence had been sent for
and shown the paper, with the remark
from Phelan: "Here is something that
will interest you." Lawrence was allowed
to take the document to his office, and
kept it until he had made a copy of it.
When the investigation commenced he
was placed in possession of the original.
When the investigation was resumed
yesterday afternoon E. H. George, a bar
keeper, was the first witness called for
the prosecution. He testified that Esola
spent much of his time when he should
have been on duty in saloons in the vicin
ity of the California street police station.
He seldom saw him clothed in his uni
form.
Defendant Esola was recalled and ques
tioned as to the extent of his education.
He said he was never a member of any
educational society. He had belonged to
cent in his trial?
Lawrence^ â No, sir.
McEnerneyâ That is all.
McGowan â Who paid Mr. MorseP
Lawrence â I don't know that Mr.
Morse has been paid.
McGowan â Did you not hire himP
Lawrence â Yes, sir â Mr. Esola is
to pay him. He is the best rnnrx in
this city in the detective line and
is the quickest man to run down a
conspirator.
Commissioner Thomas â Who, Mr.
Morse or Mr. Esola P
Lawrenceâ Mr. Morse.

John A. Britton Favors an Increase
of City Bonds to the Full
Limit Allowed by
Law.
SENATOR F. S. LTRATTON.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 20.
The latest movement in favor of bonds
and the one that promises the most Im
portant resultti is that started by the
wealthy citizens of Oakland at the home
of Captain Edwin Goodall Thursday even
ing. The character of the men who took
part in this conference is such that if
they carry out their plan of enlarging
the committee and use their endeavors to
put the bond project thro-gh to success
good results must come.
The plan of the provisional organiza
tion that was effected on Thursday
night is to enlarge the committeo to one
hundred active men, who will give their
energies to the work in hand. Only those
who are determined to help the city and
the bond proposition will be Invited and
the committee will be made as represen
tative as possible. It will include resi
dents of all sections of the city, from
the new First Ward to the new Sixth
Ward. The committee that was appoint
ed to select these names Is at work now
canvassing names and when the list is
finally given to the public it is expected
that It will appeal so strongly to the
voters of Oakland that their recommen
dations will carry weight.
The first gathering was a purely In
formal one and it was got together as
an experiment. A few gentlemen who
had the Interests of tho â¢ city.; at heart
got together to discuss the bond issue
and more to discover how the others felt
than to launch a regular bond organiza
tion. When they got together it was
found that they were all agreed that
there should be bonds and the only dis
agreement was as to the details. When
this was discovered It was decided that
they would form an organization and be
gin the work at once.
So the latest bond movement was In
augurated.
"It is simply a question of trying to do
something for the town," said Senator F.
S. Stratton, who Is the chairman of the
temporary organization. "The idea of this
organization is first to assist the City
Council with â¢ the framing of the bond
issue, and after that to resolve ourselves
into a campaign committeo for the pur
pose of furthering the passage of the
bond act. This is a movement in which
every good citizen could take an interest,
for it means the advancement of the city
in which we live. It is needless to say
that I am in favor of bonds and that I
believe that we ought all to stand to
gether. We should be willing to come
out of our homes and work for progress."

IRVINGTOX, Jan. 20.â This was the
startling editorial warning that appeared
in the Washington Press, Issued to-day.
It appeared boldly in the editorial col
umns of that paper, and has created no
little sensation in this town because of
the threat of State's prison contained
therein.
Editor E. B. Thompson of the Washing
ton Press says that he wrote the editorial
In question and that he meant it for a
warning, that the editorial meant just
what it said and that it was aimed at
some parties whose names he will not
give unless it becomes necessary for the
protection of the town, and then they v.ill
be given in the way of prosecution.
Irvington has been under a reign of ter
ror from burglaries of late. Many places
In the neighborhood have been robbed of
everything, from a revolver to a consid
erable sum of money.
Only a short time ago the Irvington Inn,
owned by E. S. Haight, was robbed of
$60 In cash. Later the houso of A. t,.
Wamsley was entered and $13 in cash and
some valuable articles were taken. Otncr
places have been entered, and the law
abiding town of Irvington has become
very much excited over the thefts.
Irvington is not an incorporated town,
and is the railroad station half-way be
tween Mission San Jose and Centerville.
It depends upon constabulary and depu
ties from the Sheriff's office in Oakland
for its peace protection, and this does not.
furnish a night patrol for the town. F.f
forts were made to trace the thefts, but
they got no nearer than suspicion of c* r
tain local characters. Then Lditor
Thompson took the preservation of peace
and property in his own hands and issued
the above warning.
"I meant what I wrote, said the ed
itor. "I want to give certain parties
warning, and if they don't take it they
will go to San Quentin. It Is rather ur.
usual to warn criminals through a news
paper, but I think this new method of do
ing police work through newspaper edito
rials will be a good thing. An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure, and
if the suspected parties will take the n:nt
one criminal will have been saved. I think
it is a good idea and we decided to try it

requested you to hire Mr. Morse P
Lawrence-^-Not at that time.
McGowan â Then you got Mr. Morse
before Mr. Esola requested itP
Lawrence â I knew perfectly well
the selection would be satisfactory.
When the defense commenced its case
Garret McEnerney shaped his questions
from the unsigned document that Fremont
Older had filed with the Mayor about Jan
uary 2. Older himself objected to the use
of the document, claiming that it had been
given to the Mayor in confidence and
solely for the executive's information.
"When I handed that paper to Mr. Phe
lan," said Older, "it was understood that
It was strictly confidential as between
man and man. The Mayor so understood
It, and I had his word that It would *o no

Pilot-Boat America Awaiting the Overdue Fleet.

at once go outside again.
friend, Lieutenant Esola; that he
would make an application for Chief
of Police, and that I hoped that he
would be selected.
McGowan â At that time was there
anything said by you regarding the
qualifications of Mr. Esola for Chief
of PoliceP
Lawrenceâ l said that I considered
him by long odds the best candidate
that could be selected for the office of
Chief of Police.
McGowanâ Did you at that time
tell the commission of the experience
he had had as a police officerP
Lawrence â No, that was not
brought out.
McGowanâ And did you tell the
commission at that time how long
you had known himP
Lawrence â I told them I had
known him for many years.
McGowan â And you gave him a
cordial, hearty indorsement?
Lawrenceâ l told them that I had
the greatest confidence in his integ
rity.. 5
McGowanâ At that time were not
these charges referred to, Mr. Law
rence?
Lawrenceâ No, I do not believe
they were.
Commissioner Thomasâ The charges
were not filed then, Mr. McGowan.
Lawrenceâ No, I think I said* to
Mayor Phelan that the Bulletin's
attackâ the members of the commis
sion were over at the window â
McGowanâ Do you know the date
of that meeting, Mr. Lawrence?
Lawrence â It was Sunday.
McGowanâ Was it the 7th?
Commissioner Thomas â It was the
day before we took office.
McGowan â That is the 7th.
McEnerney â Mr. Lawrence, is the
Examiner interested in any manner
in Mr. Esola's candidacy for Chief of
PoliceP
Lawrenceâ No, sir.
McEnerney-- Has it spent a single
6omÂ© time- when the Mayor was not
present?
Lawrence â I don't know. It just
happened so.
McGowan â How long was Mr. Esola
present?
Lawrence â I think about five or ten
minutes.
McGowan â Did you Introduce Mr.
Esola to the members of the commis
sion? Did you tell them he was a
candidate?
Lawrence â I did.
McGowan â Did you state to them
that he was your candidate?
Lawrence â I said he was my friend.
McGowan â Your candidate?
Lawrence â My friend.
McEnerney â This commission is not
trying itself nor Mr. Lawrence, and
these questions are irrelevant.
McGowan â Did you at that time or
at any time before inform the com
mission or any member of it that
Mr. Escla was your candidate for
Chief of Police?
McEnerney â I object on the ground
that the question is irrelevant; that
he had the right to tell the commis
sion that four thousand times.
Commissioner Thomas â What is the
Â¦use of asking the question, Mr. Mc-
Gowan? Do you consider it perti
nent?
McGowan â I want to show that the
Examiner
McEnerney â It is admitted that Mr.
Lawrence is his friend and supports
him and makes no apology for it. In
a few minutes I will come to the
question of what interest the Ex
aminer has in it. I object to this
question.
Commissioner Thomas â I sustain
the objection.
UcCjowan â Did you at this meeting
inform the Commissioners or any
member that Mr. Esola was your
candidate for Chief of PoliceP
Lawrenceâ l told you, Mr. Mc-
Gowan, that I introduced him as my
Pacific Parlor, N. S. G. W.. with Mayor
Phelan, but could not remember whetner
he had been expelled for non-payment of
dues. He had only attended one meeting
of the lodge.
Questions as to his knowledge of verbs,
nouns and other parts of speech were
ruled out by the Commissioners.
When this line of examination was shut
out Attorney McGowan attempted to get
an insight into Esola's knowledge of
police duties, but again the commission
went to the rescue.
A. M. Lawrence, after disclosing the
details of the secret meeting at the
Mayor's office, told that Mr. Phelan had
given him the unsigned Meader story pre
sented by Fremont Older. He took it to
his office, where a copy was made of it.
He said that he could read plainly the
erased lines referring to Esola's mother.
In contradiction of this. Commissioner
Thomas said he had seen the document
before Lawrence got hold of it and at that
time the erased lines could not be read.
"It was plain to me," said Mr. Thomas,
"that there was every evidence of inten
tion to obliterate the lines."
Joseph J. Ellis, clerk at San Quentin,
produced the records "showing that Esola
had been discharged from the position as
guard. E. A. Keddy, who was captain of
the guard at the time, was called for the
defense and claimed that Esola had re
signed and that the records to the con
trary were wrong. He had not mado the
entry, although his name was signed to it.
There were a number of other witness-js.
for whom Esola had worked and who had
known him as a boy, all of whom testified
that he bore a good reputation. The men
mentioned in the Meader affidavit as hav
ing been robbed by Esola or as having
been mixed up with him in various petty
crimes denied the truth of the charges.
Evidence was introduced to the effect
that Adam Stroh. who is now confined
in San Quentin, had admitted to a report
er that so far as he knew the Meader
statements were true.
Lieutenant Esola was again called to
the stand, and admitted that he, with
Barney Fox and. Thomas McCann. had
engaged in a quarrel with Guard Doolan
at San Quentln. and that Doolan in the
melee had been knocked down by Fox.
After another lot of character witnesses
had been heacfl Attorney McEnerney an
nounced that all of the testimony of the
defense was In, and that he was ready to
go to argument. Attorney McGowan was
inclined to let the argument go over to
to-morrow, but McEnerney and the com
mission objected, and he finally agreed to
proceed.
Mr. McGowan reviewed fully the evi
dence which had been offered by the Bul
letin and paid particular attention to that
which dealt with the close relations be
tween Lawrence and Esola and the more
than disinterested part played in the case
by Mayor Phelan. Commissioner Thomas
twice Interrupted him in his remarks con
cerning the Mayor, but McGowanjinsisted
Â¦upon his point and. although temperate m
his remarks, succeeded in placing fully
before the board the facts In proof of the
triple alliance.
Mr. McEnerney did not argue at jrreat
length and did not review the evidence
submitted. He relied rather upon the
character of the witnesses offered by the
complainants, and attempted to clou 3 the
main issue by alluding to newspaper con
troversies in general and the late un
pleasantness in particular.
Mr. MeGowan closed for the complain
ants, and the commission adjourned after
intimating that it would In all probability
make independent and secret investiga
tion of its own before handing down its
findings. Ex-Chief of Police Crowley w!U
probably be called in by them to-morrow.

estate of the late Sarah B. Byrod for two
weeks to allow the litigants to compro

versy which is delaying the settlement.

stead of taking assignments from him.
He said he believed the heir to be incom
petent.

FIGHTING TALK STILL
IN THE SIMPSON SUIT
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.â The bad blood in
the Slmpson-Nusbaumer feud continues,
and this morning there was considerable
excitement occasioned by a conversa
tion between Attorneys M. C. Chap
man and McElrath. It appears that
Chapman heard that Simpson had made
threats to "fix" him, and thU morning
he went to Simpson's attorney, McElrath,
to inquire about it. The conversation be
tween the two before court convened was
enough to Bet all sorts of rumors afloat.
"I went to McElrath to inquire about
Simpson's threats." explained Chapman
afterward, "and he admitted that they
had been made. I told him I would be
prepared to take care of myself. That is
all/
But although the rumors of a fight were
plentiful, the session of the court was a
very quiet one. The first witness thi3
morning was W. OB. Macdonough, son
of the capitalist who compromised w.th
Simpson and the holders of sub-liens, but
he had no knowledge of his father's ac
counts in February, 1893. Andrew Dalziel.
who signed the checks from, the firm of
Dalziel & Moller, showed by his books
that the sum of $616 80 on February 23 and
$400 on February 24, 1593, had been paid by
Robert Dalziel on account of R. F. Simp
son. He also testified that in February,
ISD3, ho had a talk with Nusbaumer and
Simpson and understood that the SI63J
owed by the latter was to come from the
Macdonough money. He was given to un
derstand that Nusbaumer was to see that
the Dalziel debt was paid, but he gai-o as
his belief that Simpson had turned in the
Macdonough notes.
Late this afternoon the plaintiff was
placed on the stand, and he gave a
graphic description of the encounter he
had with Nusbaumer in Thayer's saloon
on Eighth street last December.
"I repeated my demand for an account
ing," said Simpson on the stand, "and he
commenced abuslnj? me. Then we squared
off and Nusbaumer asked A. A. Moore,
who was present, to hold his spectacles.
We were separated before any blows were
struck, however."
Simpson was still on tho stand exam
ining and explaining the different paper*
In the case when Judge ColTey of San
Francisco, before whom the matter Is be
ing heard, adjourned court till next Sat
urday.
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
AT HEARST HALL
Mrs. Hearst Receives the Freshmen.
Series of Receptions Inaugur
ated.
BERKELEY, Jan. 20.â For four hours
this afternoon Hearst Hall was thronged
with visitors, the occasion being- tho re
ception to the freshmen class and the
members of the faculty. Mrs. Hearst,
simply but tastefully attired, received her
guests, standing at the head of the broad
stairway, while her charming niece. Miss
Lane, herself now a "co-ed." circulated
among the young people, tactfully putting
them at their ease and explaining the
many art treasures adorning the walls.
These consist largely of priceless tapes
tries and Oriental rugs, the whole consti
tuting one of the finest collections in ex
istence. Numerous attendants anticipated
every want of the guests in the cloak
rooms, reception hall and in the service
of the elaborate refection served in the
great dining hall downstairs. As to the
guests themselves they were very much
delighted.
The faculty was well represented. Pro
fessor Joseph Le Conte was there and
merry laughter resounded from the group
of girls surrounding the bent figure of
the great mm whose youth is perennial
in spite of his Increasing years.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler chat
ted with the "co-eds" and chummed with
the boys. This is another thing the stu
dents are trying, and very successfully,
to get used to. They entirely approve of
the new chief and like him better the
more they see of him. "Do you know,"
lisped one pretty freshman, "at the junior
'prom' he danced with the girls?"
Many other men of distinction, such as
Bernard Moses and Charles Mills Gayley,
came in during the afternoon, testifying
to the fact that the university officially
approves of Mrs. Hearst's hospitable In
novation. Professors were In the assem
blage who had never before met in social
intercourse any of the students under
their charge. This is Just what Mrs.
Hearst wants. She believes that the most
effective work is impossible without fa
miliar personal acquaintance between in
structor and pupil, as well as among the
students themselves.
Next Saturday Mrs. Hearst will be at
home to the sophomore class and the fac
ulty. After that the Junior and senior
classes will be received in turn.
The first of the Sunday afternoon con
certs will be given at Hearst Hall to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock. Admission
will be by card owing to the limited ca
pacity of the hall. The concert will be
under the direction of Henry Holmes, the
conductor of the San Francisco symphony
orchestra.
John A. Brltton, the manager of the
Oakland Gas Light and Heat Company, is
at the head of the sub-committee for tho
purpose of the larger commit
tee. He is very enthusiastic over the
question of bonds and the new movement
to help matters along.
"Citizens should" take an Interest In the
affairs of the city in which they live and
this is one of the occasions when they
can legitimately take an active Interest
in municipal affairs without being
charged with any politics. There ought
to be an organization to secure the is
suance of bonds. It should be comprised
of all people who have the Interests of
the city at heart. Harmony should ex
ist and the needs of the entire city con
sulted. This should be a campaign or
education. All classes ought to be
reached. I would go about securing an
Issue of bonds just as I would go about
the securing of an election to Congress.
I would have every voter, be he great or
small, and have him interviewed per
sonally. Circulars do no good In a mat
ter of this kind. It would be useless for
a lot of us to get together in a hall and
make speeches to each other. We must
do actual work If we are to succeed.
"As for bonds, I am in favor of voting
the full limit allowed by law and ap
portioning the money among the different
needs of the city. First we need the in
tercepting sewer, then streets, then more
fire protection, then a new City Hall. 1
am a crank on parks, for they make a
city attractive and add to tho assessable
value of property."
H. P. Gordon, the secretary of the tem
porary organization, is actively at work.
"Of course we need bonds. It is not
now a question of exactly what we need,
for that can be determined later. It is
first necessary to get the bond proposi
tion started on Us way and then decide
upon details with the aid of engineers
and men who are skilled In the work we
want. Then should come the work for
the election and that should be carried
on as systematically as a political elec
tion."
READING ROOM
FOR CHILDREN
TO BE PROVIDED
An Annex to the New
Library.
PLAN OF THE EBELL LADIES
A FUND TO BE RAISED FOR THAT
PURPOSE.
The Project Is Already Under Way
and the Little Ones
Will Not Bo Over
looked.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 20.
Xot content -with their work of raising
$20,000 for the purchase of a site upon
which to erect the Carnegie Lfbrary, the
ladies of the Ebell Society are showing
their indomitable public spirit by declar
ing that they will raise another fund of
JoOOO with which to build an annex for
the exclusive use of the children of Oak
land. The wing for the use of the little
ones will contain nothing but Juvenile lit
erature and all the interior arrangements
will be provided entirely for the benefit of
the youngsters.
The room will be provided with min
iature tables and chairs and the shelves
will be so arranged that the tiniest tot
can easily secure access to the books
which they contain.
Among the volumes will be everything
from nursery rhymes and picture-books
up to stories for boys and girls. Consid
erable money has already been subscribed
for the project, although it has hardly
been publicly exploited yet. and the ladies
anticipate i:o difficulty in raising the
requisite amount.
The idea originated with Mrs. F. B.
Ginn. Several of the ladles who are most
active in the movement to provide a read
ing-room for the little ones are in Los An
geles this week attending the meeting for
the formation of a State federation of
women's clubs. As soon as they return
a pian of campaign will be determined
and the work of securing subscriptions
will be systematically commenced. Should
they mÂ«-et with the immediate success
which the members of the Kbell Society
anticipate an effort Â¦will then probably be
made to secure an additional fund of $5000
with -which to purchase suitable reading
matter for the children's room.
Mrs. Ginn is more enthusiastic over the
endeavor to provide a place In which the
youngsters can go and enjoy themselves
even than she was in raising the original
fund for the purchase of the library loca
tion and she was one of the leading spir
its in that work.
When the addition Is erected she Is de
sirous of securing some famous artist
here just for the purpose of decorating
that particular room. When it is finished
she -wants it to be the finest affair of its
kind in any city of a Fize corresponding
with Oakland in the United States. She
is being ably assisted in the preliminary
work by Mrs. R. P. Gleason. Mrs. Wil
lftim Bostwick Curtis, Mrs. W. 11. Friend
and many other prominent members of
the Ebell Society. Mrs. Captain M. Simp-
Fon and several others have already sent
checks toward the fund.
In Houston, Texas, where the ladies are
endeavoring to raise money for a site for
a Carnegie library, it is also the Intention
to provide a reading-room for children.
They have already received a promise
from on* gentleman of that city of $6000
In aid of that scheme.
ARPER SELLS
TO STANDARD
OIL COMPANY
Deal a Surprise to
Merchants.
CONSIDERATION NOT GIVEN
>
END OF A BITTER FIGHT OF LONG
STANDING.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 20.
A deal which has caused a great deal
of surprise in local commercial circles -was
consummated yesterday when George W.
Arper sold his wholesale oil business t^
the Standard Oil Company. For years
Arper has carried on an opposition against
the big corporation and hi 3 success has
been remarkable. Now. when it was sup
posed to be at its height, ho has sold to
his old enemy and he admits that the sals
was most advantageous to himself. ll*
will not. however, give tho purchasing
price.
It is reported that the Whlttler-Coburn
Company Is building tank cars prepara
tory to entering this field and this la sup
posed to be the reason why the Standard
Oil Company was so anxious to secure
Arper's business. It is understood that
the Standard's bid was the highest of two
bids made to Arper, and while ho will not
admit that the Whittier-Coburn Company
desired the business to bettor carry on its
fight against the older corporation It 13
generally believed that that company was
another bidder.
Arper's light against the Standard O'.l
Company has been a most bitter one. bur
he has had the encouragement of the Oak
land merchants. In his light he found It
necessary to construct tank cars of hi*
own and send them to the Pennsylvania
oil fields. He also had to fight the rail
roads, as frequently these cars were side
tracked at points along the line and would
not be heard from for days at a time.
In connection with his wholesale busi
ness Arper for a time conducted a retail
business, which he recently leased to
Smith & Baxter. Considerable litigation
grew out of this lease and a J20.00Q damage
suit against Arper is now pending. It 1*
understood that Webb N". Pearce has now
acquired the retail business. Arper states
that he will now undertaka a business
venture at Cape Xome.
CLOSING SOME
OF THE HEW
WATER DEALS
A Big Stockholders'
Meeting Called.
WILLIAM J. DINGEE RETURNS
CONTRA COSTA ABSORBING TWO
SMALLER COMPANIES.
Eome Small Tangles Over the Arte
eian "Water Company and Ala
meda Water Company
Incorporations.
OaJiland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 23.
"William J. Dlngee. the chief owner of
Â¦the Centra Costa Water Company, lias
returned quietly from the East. Mr. Din
gee's unrxpÂ».-ct<?d return to California lias
caused rumors of all kinds of water deals
:o arsr^, but these Mr. Dingee refused to
tliseufs.
However, a stockholders' meeting of the
<v>r;:ra Costa Water Company has been
called for January "0, when some very
Important deals will be finished, and it is
be!->ved that Mr. LMngee returned to Cali
fornia in <>rder to attend this ajid see that
his ptt schemes did not go astray.
There have been found some tangles In
the abforbtion of the Artesian Water
Company of Alameda and the Alameda
Water Company of Berkeley. Neither of
these companies has b<^cn properly in
corporated, and this makes the work of
transfer ot the companies somewhat com
plicated.
The purchasÂ© of the Artesian Water
Company of Alameda nas already been
made by the directors of the Contra Costa
Water Company, and this purchase is
sought to be ratified at the stockholders'
meeting which has been railed for Janu
p.ry 20. so that th!s deal is practically
eloped.
The purchase of the Berkeley plant ha*
rot been completed an- the papers have
not yet been signed. There has been a
KTeat deal of surveying and preparation
receseaxy. and the uncertain condition of
the incorporation has added to the delay.
The agreements are almost ready to be
ripned. and an effort will be made to sub
mit the ratification of this purchase as
vei] at the coming meeting.
Then Mr. Dingee has been closing some
of the branches of his business in this
<'ity. He ha? turned his insurance busi
ness ovÂ«T to Roseoe Havens, and has di
vided his house renting ousiness between
Bdden & Cook and Rosooe Havens. He
will, however, keep his real estate busi
ness In Oakland.
"I have nothing to Fay about my busi
ngs affairs now," said Mr. Dinpee in
Oakland to-day. "I have been looking at
thf water question in the Kast. and I
find that the water served at the WnJdnrf
-â¢Xstoria Hotel in New York is worse than,
that served In Oakland.
â¢I forl that there is going to be a de
rided advance in California real estate.
A prosit deal of attention has been at
tracted to thi< riaFt. ?nd If the people
fcere would only bury their petty differ-

Dewey's Six Thousand Namesakes.
George vv ashlngton la now hopelessly
relegated to second place, with Abraham
Lincoln a bad third, for having babies
named after them. Dewey did it. ThÂ©
number of newcomers named after the
hero of all heroes Is up In the thousands,
and they are still comingâ babies and
names, too. It has been figured out that,
according to the ratio In a country of 70.
000.000 people, the number of the admiral's
namesakes should reach about 6000 now.
Not only the boy babies are eligible to the
honor but many girls have been named
Georjriana Dewey and a few have b*en
called Dewlana. There is one in New
Tork called Dewlana Dooley. When thÂ«
admiral reaches that city the Bureau of
Vital Statistics will have a rubber stamp
made, and It Is not Improbable there will
be a regiment of young Deweys In baby
carringes to greet him. ThiÃ Is another
of the penalties of fame.â Troy Times.

Ereclal Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, Jan. 20.â Quite a storm of
disapproval has been aroused among the
voters and taxpayers of the town of Wil
lows by the recent action of the Board
of Supervisors in changing the boundary
lines between Supervisorial districts 1
and 4. The line as it now stands runs
through the northern portion of the town
into District 4.
Henry Bielar, the natural opponent of
Mr. Bovd and the recognized candidate
of the town for the office of Supervisor,
lcsiues iv tnis portion of the town which
has been transferred rrom District 1,
Boyd's district, to District 4, Garnett's
district. It is thought that this change
was made in order to re-elect Boyd Su
pervisor at the next election. With Mr.
Bielar out of the way, Mr. Boyd's chances
would be much better.
The Supervisors deny this charge, stat
ing that this positively was not their in
tention. They say the change was made
In order to abolish one judicial district,
thus doing away with one Constable and
one Justice of the Peace. They claim it
was done merely for the purpose of re
ducing expenses.
Whatever the purpose, the act Is bring
ing forth harsh criticism both from the
people and local press.
The Supervisors provided that the ordi
nance changing the boundary lines should
take effect immediately, but the ordinance
abolishing the judicial district is not to
take effect until three years hence.

A FOREIGN COINâ W. F. M., City.
"A coin the size of a 10-cent piece, having
upon ii t'arlus 111, 1712." is not a sufficient
description to enable one to place the
Mmc in the catalogues. Correspondents

tion as possible.

owe road and hospital tax for 1809 the
collector can demand the same this year

son, Cal. A New Jersey cent of ITSB, with
date under the plow beam, commands a

possible to tell what class it belongs to.
It may be one of the class that com
mands a high premium or one that sells
for cents. A 1-cent piece of ISO 3 sells
for 10 cents.
ABBREVIATIONâ R. B. T., Alameda,
Cal. By common consent '93 was written
instead of 1599. and some are now writing
'00 as an abbreviation of 1900, even some
postoffice stamps have '00. but that cer
tainly is not correct, that is in the strict
tense of the idea to be conveyed. A
writer who wishes to be right should un
der all circumstances express the year in
full. It takes but a moment to do so and
then there cannot be any misunderstand
ing of what the writer means.
BUCKNER. AT FORT DONELSONâ

bellion the Confederacy decided to defend

FrtANCO - PRUSSIAN WAR â Sub
scriber. San Jose, Cal. In the Franco-

francs; total. 13.939.000.000 francs. For ad
ditional information see encyclopedias and
histories of the Franco-Prussian war to
be found in the libraries.
COMMON PARTNERS-S., City. If a
man was a partner in two different firms,
and firm No. 1 borrowed money from firm
No. 2 and in time firm No. 1 could not
meet the note given when it became due,
the remedy for firm No. 2 to commence an
action Is laid down In "The American and
English Encyclopedia of Law," and the
position taken Is supported by many au
thorities. The language Is: "As the same
party cannot be both plaintiff and defend
ant in an action, one nrm cannot maintain
an action at law against another firm
when the two firms have common mem
bers, and the fact that the claim is a
single demand and not a general balance
makes no difference. But when the claim
Is for a fixed amount after arrangement
with the creditor firm, the assignee may
recover on an action at law. So where all
notes are considered as Joint and several
the one firm may cue the other upon such
claims by omitting to make the common
partner defendant, and the rule does not
apply to a promise or obligation given by
a nrm to a member of another firm having
other members common to both firms."
In equity, however, and under the codes
which administer equitable and legal
remedies without distinction such action
may be maintained in much the same way
as though they were legal distinct bodies.
And in bankruptcy or insolvency proceed
ings the solvent partners of the creditor
firm may prove their claims and realize
upon them as though there were no com
mon partners.
A CAULâ M. H.. City. According to
superstition, a child born with a caul or
veil over its face is said to be lucky. It
was from the earliest ages and even down
to the present day a popular belief that
a child so born would be very fortunate
and that the caul brought fortune to the
one purchasing it. This superstition was
so common in the early church that St.
Chrysostom felt it his duty to inveigh
against It In many of his homilies. In
later times midwlves sold cauls to advo
cates at enormous prices as "an especial
means of making them eloquent," and to
seamen as an Infallible preservative
against drowning. It was supposed also
that the health of the peraQn born with It
could be told by the caul. If tlrm and
crisp it betokened good health: but if re
laxed and flaccid, sickness or death. Dur
ing the eighteenth century it was common
to find advertisements In English news
papers of cauls offered for sale at prices
varying from $30 to $150. As late as May
8, 1848, there appeared in the London
Times an advertisement of a caul for six
guineas, "which was afloat with its late
owner for thirty years In all the perils of
the sea. and the owner died at last at the
place of his birth."
CHILDREN OF CITIZENSâ Reader.
Blsbee, Cal. "The children of persons
who have been naturalized citizens of the
United States, being under the age of 21
at the time of the naturalization of par
ents, shall, If dwelling in the United
States, be considered as citizens thereof."
The language given is from the United
States naturalization laws. The same
laws also say: "The children of persons
who are now or have been citizens of the
United States, are, though born out of
limits and Jurisdiction of the United
States, considered as citizens thereof."

Btricken. the public in general are dumfounded,
Bpeechless. Had he been born In the time of

little less than miraculous.

Lawyers, speculators, business men of all
grades, and ladles from every walk of life to-
gether Bound his praise for the benefit they have
received. So extraordinary are his marvelous
tests of the wonders and powers of clairvoyancy
that they must be witnessed to be believed.

fe-sion that no other can hope to attain. Truth-
ful in his predictions, reliable In his advice, no
matter what troubles you may have with your-

a certainty higher than human power. Profes-
fcor May is recognized by the press, medical /ra-

FACTS ABOUT BANANAS.
Why the Red Banana Has Disap-
peared.
Red bananas are so scarce nowadays
as to be practically a rarity; the prevail
ing banana is yellow. Twenty years and
more ago the red was the prevailing
banana and the yellow the rare one. The
change from red to yellow is due to com
mercial reasons; the yellow banana Is
more profitable.
The yellow banana requires less care
and time in the -cultivation, and so costs
less in that stage. It sticks to the bte-n
better than the red banana, and so stands
more yellow bananas to the bunch than
red. With all these marked Â¦ advantages
in its favor the yellow banana has prac
tically driven the red banana out.
With this great scarcity red bananas
now bring fancy prices; It may be ten
times as much as yellow bananas. Wltn
yellow bananas at $1 or $1 50 a bunch red
would be worth from $6 to $11. and there
would be fewer in a bunch. Red bananas
Beir nowadays In the fruit stores as high
as 20 cents each. The comparatively :ew
bunches Imported are taken by dealers in
fine and fancy fruits as novelties, the
rarity. In large measure, determining the
price. It may be asked . why, with red
bananas at such prices, more are not cul
tivated; to which the answer Is that If

Mark Twain's Retort.
Last year, in Vienna, S. L.. Clemens
(Mark Twain) pat talking with a Scotch
barrister named Guthrle.
"Do you ever smoke?" asked .Mr.
Clemens of Mr. Guthrle.
"Yes. Mr. Clemens," replied Mr. Guth
ri*Â». "when I am in bad company."

more were raised the price would go down
again, and there would be no profit in
raisin? them for the general demand in
competition with the more economically
produced, more prolific and better ship
ping yellow bananas. The red banana ap
pears to be now In Its scarcity like some
other kind of comparatively rare fruit?,
or, say, like game. Some people prefer
the flavor of the red banana, some prefer
that of the yellow; it Is probable that th*
great majority would have no choice; and
the far lower price at which the yellow
banana can be offered to the individual
consumer settres the question.
Bananas were never before so cheap as
they have been in very recent years.
Formerly a luxury that was rather costly
than otherwise, the banana is now a chyap
luxury. Very good bananas can now be
bought commonly in the streets in the
season at a cent apiece, or 10 cents a
dozen, such as formerly cost two or three
times as much. Formerly bananas were
brought to this country in sailing, vessels,
in slick, fast schooners, which with any
sort of favoring conditions made quick
trips: with adverse' weather, if long con
tinued, the cargoes rotted. Now bananas
are brought by steam, in fast steamers
built especially for the fruit trade. These
steamers may. of course, be held up by
storms, but they are not likely to be;
commonly they land cargoes here in a
specified time, and in the best and most
suitable condition for handling and mar
keting to the best advantage and with
the least possible waste, and with ad
vantage as to evenness of supply. The
great bulk of the banana trade in this
country Is now controlled by a company
which banana Importers have organized.
The bananas eaten in this country come
from Costa Rica. British and Spanich
Honduras, Colombia. Jamaica and Cuba;
that is. from countries around the south
ern part of the Gulf of Mexico and around
the Caribbean Sea, The bulk of the fruit
from the gulf countries goes to New Or
leans for distribution, that from the other
countries coming to Atlantic ports. For
many years bananas have had a more or
less wide distribution from the ports of
receipt, but they were never before co
widely distributed nor sold so cheaply at
interior points as now. Bananas are now
sold, not as rarities, but more or less com
monly, in all parts of the country; prac
tically everywhereâ the eastern part of
the country being supplied from Atlantic
ports, and the Mississippi Valley and the
western part from New Orleans. Costa
Rica bananas are now shipped from New
Orleans over pretty much all the West
ern country to the Pacific Coast.â New

NEW TOP.X. Jan. 20.â The market in stocks

exf^ectatlon ot a favorable Lank statement.
Tire stateir.er.t proved more favorable than the
most aangulr.e espectatior.s. yet the market
lost even the srr.all animation It had been
fhowing whÂ«-n the ttaternent appeared on the
tape. The net changes In prices are without
ElgT.lflCiJice, those of any amount being re
stricted to insignificant stocks. London re-
I>orted a. firm and confident market, but the
confidence did not extend to the point of hold-
Jr.g American stocks up to parity level, and the
opening here was very ragged and lrrrgular.
Tne lack any upward impetus from London
u.ni the utter indifference manifested to the
bank statement offer*^ a poor market In which
to r^aiize^ or sell Ins by yyterday's buyers
rr.'.nht have been larger. In the absence of
Â«J*-irui.nd they e**ta*(l satisStd to keep their
holdings.
But there was no inclination to add to them.

TUOLUMNE RIVER AT LA GRANGE
NEW YORK. Jan. 20.â The Financier says:
The NfW York Ciearing-h^use banks added no
less than $11.336.000 to their cash holdings last
w<:ek. bringing the total cafeh on hand to $215.
sfcs.;iXi. an amount larger than they have re
ported In vaults for months' past. The surplus
reserve rose about seven and one-half million*
of dollars and stands at present at $24,154.ti7j.
This contrasts quite ehcrply with the actual
deficit existing sixty days ago. The rapid re
covery is due of courfu to the return of money
from the interior and to the disbursement o*
treajury tunds into active channels of com
merce. Counting the fifteen millions of gold
exported, it appears that no less than forty-
Fix millions of cash has come Into, the New
York banks In sixty days. The fact that sur
plus reserves now are not correspondlntcly
larger is due to the growth of deposits, which
are about twenty-seven and one-half millions
heavier than two months ago. This, of course,
necessitates an Increased cash reserve. The
operations of the week, considering the qule.t
ne*3 in th<* speculative markets, were rather
Furprlslng by reason of their magnitude. Loans
have expanded $4.379.in0, whereas not half of
this increase has been anticipated. Interest
centers around the heavy cash expansion. It
had been known that the banks were gaining
an enormous volume of currency from the in
terior, and frt-m all appearance the statement
reflects the reports of this money In full. The
National City Bank Â»eems to have absorbed
about all the specie that came to the Clearing
house institution. The expansion in loans and
the receipt of eleven millions cash deposits is
responsible f" r the expansion of sixteen mil
lions in the latter case. The statement fore
shadows a coctinued easy money market.
Whether this will lead to a revival In specu
lative activity Is a question that is being care
fully debated at present. In 1534, with record
breaking bank reserves, security markets were
almost lifeless, but conditions now are so dif
ferent that there is no analogy. The activity
noticeable of late In the bond market shows
that funds are seeking investment at prevail
ing interest rates. The future will be deter
mined by the continuance of the Interior move
ment this way. If it retains Its present volume
the usuhl results of easy- money and prosper
ous conditions, as reflected In speculative cir
cles, will DO doubt be witnessed again.

Monday night by Noble Grand Arch
James F. Martlnonl, Grand Secretary
Graves and Grand Treasurer E. H.
Goetze. The work was exemplified by the
initiation of two candidates and after
short addresses by the visiting officials
there was a banquet and a pleasant even-
Ing.
The gTand secretary recently returned
from a flying trip to Modesto, his former
home, and while there he revived Mistle
toe Circle, which had been dormant for
nearly two years. New officers were
elected and Installed and It Is likely that
tho circle will now move along with the

the grand secretary' and Jacob Nickels,
grand trustee, visited San Jose, Garden
and Columbus groves in joint session,
witnessed two Initiations and discovered
much enthusiasm in the groves. The
grand officers were, after the work, the
guests of the groves at a banquet.
The noble grand arch, while on a busi
ness trip at San Luis Obispo and Guada
lupe, found the Druids there very active
and working hard to have many live can
didates on the occasion of the approach
ing official visits.
There are good prospects for a new
grove at Santa Maria. Aurora Grove at
its last held meeting Initiated three can
didates. Magnolia Grove of Los Angeles
at its last held meeting had fifty-two

desk. Mount Tamalpals received four ap
