the aim. Harry McEwing of Louisville
was shot In the foot and \V. O. Rldpatch
of Chicago sustained a broken leg by the
lifeless form of Scott falling against him
as It rolled down the stairway."
The tragedy is one of the most sensa
tional in the history of the "dark an.l
Moody ground." The killing occurred in
the lobby of the Capitol Hotel, the princi
pal hostelry of the State capital, the room
bring well filled at the time with poli
ticians and others who are here attending
the contests for State offices before tho
Lftdslature.
Colonel Colson Is in Jail to-night charged
Â¦with murder, but he claims self defense.
The witnesses to the affair were taken
po much by surprise whf n the shooting
began that most of them were almost
panic stricken, and there r.re many con
f.!ct!ng stories as to how the fight began.
Colonel Colson and a party of friends,
among whom was Demarree. were sitting
In the lobby engaged in conversation as
Bcott and Captain Golden came up the
stairs from the barroom, walking in the
dlrecticn of Colson. The latter, it is said,
half rising from his chair, fired at Scott,
who instantly returned the fire. The
ehootlng then became general, and by
standers are at variance as to the num
ber engaged in It. Demarree was stand
ing elightly In front of Colson. and young
Bcott is said to have crouched behind him
to ward off bullets from Colson's revol
ver. In an instant Demarree fell dead,
pierced by three bullets.
Captain Golden, who accompanied Scott,
reeled to one side, falling Into the arms
of ex-Govrraor James E. McCreary, ex
claiming "I am shot."

times, and as he staggered back and fell
down the Ftairway, Colson, vrbo was
within a few feet of him. continued the
f.rc until the form of Scott rolled over and
showed life extinct.
The battle was terrific and bullets .fairly
reined through the lobby of the hotel,
r-veral of which went wild, piercing win
dow glars or embedding themselves In the
walls and furniture of the hotel. It was
rot discovered for several minutes that
Julian, who died later, had been shot, and
et first his wound was thought to be only
trifling.
After the k"!lng Colonel Colson ran out
of the hotel and hurriod to the residence
of Chief of Police Williams, where he sur
rendered. He was almost exhausted and
as he entered the house gapped: "I am
porry he would not let me alone. There
Ti'pre three of them shooting at me."
Meantime the wildest excitement pre
vailed in the hotel lobby where the. kill
ing occurred and in the dining-room near
by. where about 200 guests had been seat
ed at dinner when the fusillade began.
Men fell over each other in, frantic ef
forts to get to places of safety, women
fainted and it was several minutes before

CONFLAGRATION SWEEPS
DAWSON'S MAIN STREET
Water System Fails at a Critical
Time and Much Property. Is
Destroyed
TACOMA, Jan. 16.â A report has reached this city that Dawson has oneÂ«
more suffered from a disastrous fire. The statement is made that property
valued at fully half a million dollars was destroyed. The water system of
the town Is said to have failed completely at a critical time, the result being
that the fire fighters found themselves almost powerless to stay the pro
gress of the conflagration.
Many homes were burned and a large quantity of supplies destroyed, as thÂ«
result of which much suffering has since been experienced In the town.
At Skaguay on January 10 a dispatch was received from Dawson stating that
a fire was in progress, but was under control. The wires were working badly and
no particulars could be obtained. The conflagration^ was on the main street,
where many buildings were without chimney protection.
According to a Modesto man lately returned from Dawson and how in this
city. the. equipment for fighting fire in the Yukon town was thought to be
equal to any emergency that might arise. Dawson owns two large steam fire
engines of the latest pattern, besides a large Babcock chemical engine and a
number of hand engines, some fifty or more, counting the private ones.
The thickly built up business part of the town lies on the flat along the river
and the residences and scattered houses on the hillside.
After the river freezes over the two large steamers are kept out on the
Ice near the Alaska Commercial Company's landing, about three-quarters of a
mile above the mouth of the Klondike River. The !ce freezes from two and
a half to five feet thick, but holes from which the. engines can take water are
kept open. Steam can be got up and suction had within a few minutes'
time. Several hundred feet of large hose enables the engines to reach well up
on'the hillside. If the fire occurs any great distance from the regular station
the engines can be moved on the ice to a point on the river where they can do
most good. Under the circumstances It Is not easy to understand how the water
supply ga/e out.

There is considerable ground for believ

A late dispatch from the besieged town
states that there, are signs that the Boers'
preparations- were made for the purpose
of a retreat, the hills, to. the f northwest
being fortified, while few. big guns have

LONDON, Jan. 17.â The silence in
Natal is broken this morning by
the single item of news from Pieter
maritzburg that very heavy firing
was heard on Monday in the direc
tion of the Tugela.
From this it is possible that hard fight
ing .has oegun and that the British" arc
not being- allowed to cross the Tugela
without fierce opposition. On the other
hand, it may be only a bombardment pre
liminary to the assault of Colenso, or
merely a heavy artillery fire meant to
cover the flank operations, which are now
generally believed to be going on in force
on the British left and to eastward at
Potgieters Drift. Â«V %7- :
Reports emanating from Durban and
Frere that General Warren has moved
toward Weenen are now regarded as offi
cially inspired to distract attention from
General Buller's move.
No information is allowed to pass as to
the position of various columns which are
now forcing a passage of the Tugela.-
One version places General Warren at
Colenso. ; According to another he is with
General Buller north of Hpringfleld.
Natal telegrams which have arrived
during the last few days are not likely
to let anything pass which would dis
close General Buller's real intentions.
But, while the public Is in the dark,
there is every reason for saying that tjie
War Office has not only received news
from General Buller which it is keeping
secret, but that the news has been of the
most satisfactory nature.
I am told on good authority that since
Saturday morning the War Offlca has been
in possession of news which it cannot give
out until the aim of the combined move
ment of Generals Buller and Warren has
been accomplished.
What is patent to all Is a change in
the demeanor of high officials of the War
Office in the last few days. An air of
suppressed exultation has replaced the
worried, serious mood. A little straw
which shows which way the wind Is blow
ing is found In the extreme gayety of
General Wolseley at a dinner, party on
Monday evening. I am told that those
present thought that such levity was
rather Inappropriate, all the more so as
the open talk is that General Wolseley
should most certainly be called to book
for the plan of campaign which caused
so disastrous a beginning.
This unusual good humor on the part
of Lord Wolseley .-/which was described to
me as being quite. remarkable, might like
ly be caused by. good news from the front.
To back this supposition up there is the
fact of perfect silence from Boer sources.
From tliem, . if not from General Buller,
we would have had some indication "ere
this had there been any reverse for the
British forces. .
Another, straw showing, the probability
not only that the news has been received
but that some of it is leaking out is a
statement by the military correspondent
in this morning's Leader, who Is known to
be exceptionally lucky in; obtaining hv
sldanews, to the effect that on Monday
morning General Warren's division* was
encamped between Springfield,;, where
General Buller at that time had his head
quarters, and Bethany, being five miles
The permanent railway bridge is almost
completed. Heavy rains have fallen in
the hills recently, and the fords of Reit
River are all Impassable.
It Is reported that it will be necessary
to relay the rails over almost the entire
distance from Modeler River to Kimber
ley. the Boers having used the rails and
sleepers in building their fortifications.
Stories still reach camp that the Free
Staters desire to end the war. The lat
est report is that a council was held re
cently at Bloemfonteln, at which Presi
dent Stein and General Cronje were pres
ent. It was then stated that unless tha
British began the attatX by January 17
the Free States would return home. The
enormous difficulty the Boers must ex
perience In provisioning their Spytfontetn
army, which is far from the railway head,
is very evident.
NATAL DUTCHMEN
AMONG THE KILLED
LADYSMITH. Jan. 8 (By messenger to
Weenen. Jan. 16).â A representative of tha
Associated Prtss visited Saturday's bat
tlefield this raomlns and saw large num
bers of Boer dead. The British guns
seemed to have worked great havoc. OnÂ©
Boer was completely disemboweled, an
other had his head shot clean off and a
couple of others were killed by the same
shell, evidently while eating their lunch
eon, as hard-boiled eggs lay beside them.
Xatal Dutchmen were recognized sunong
the dead. A number of Boer bodies and
carcasses of horses have been washed
down Intombl Spruit, which became a
raging torrent during a heavy thunder
storm. The British while digging graves
were fired on by the Boer artillery and
several of them were hit. Soft-nosed bul
lets and dumdum cartridges have been
found on wounded prisoners. Volunteers
carried the Boer dead off the hill and
handed the bodies over to their comrades

carried off Wagon Hill alone.

The Boers literally tumbled over each

persistent fire of the British Inflicted a

Desultory firing continued for some
time, but the attack was an utter failure
and the Boers retreated to the shelter of
the small kopjes at the base of the hill.
REIGN OF TERROR
IN SWAZILAND
LONDON. Jan. 17.â The Pletermarltz
burg correspondent of the Times, tele
graphing Tuesday. January 16. says:
"The Delagoa Bay correspondent of the
Natal Times asserts that six big Creusot
guns and fifty tons of shells were landed
from the French steamer Glronde about
the middle of last month under the noses
of two British warships and were dis
patched to Pretoria, causing much re
joicing at the ease with which contraband
of war can run the blockade.
"The Swazl 'Queen mother, since the
death of King Bunu, has killed all the
chiefs who were ever in England and
Cape Town and is now plotting with the
Boers. The situation may fairly be con
sidered grave, and it would be well to
send regiments of Goorkhas to Swaziland
Immediately."
Refugees from Swaziland living in tne
Lebombo district recently brought news
to Lourenzo Marquez that the Queen or
Swaziland was dead. Her death, follow
ing so soon upon that of King Bunu, was
looked upon with suspicion. According to
their story, however, not the Queen mother
but Necoco, -Bunu's brother, was acting
as head of the Swazl nation, and he. In
conjunction with Tcuba. Umbandlne's old
prime minister, was carrying on a reigu
of terror, killing off whole kraals all over

COLONEL DAVID G. COLSON.
DIARY OF SIEGE OF LADYSMITH.
A division from Estcourt moving off
when General Buller - moved from Frcre
would be screened from the enemy's ob
servation. The movement continued would
take it to a point west of Potgieters Drift,
as the next passage to the westward, uu
cordlng to maps, is that on the road to
Bethany.
It is .possible that General Warren's di
vision followed the road. In that case
after crossing the river it would have a
very long march. It is about thirty miles,
.or. two days, to Dewdrop from Estcourt.
By. way. of Bethany to Dewdrop it is not
less than eighty miles, or about a week>
march, so that if General Warren left
Estcourt on Tuesday . or. Wednesday last
he may to-day be within a day's march
of Dewdrop.
Dewdrop is about i ten miles from Pot
gieters Drift, and the Boer position whicn
in ex-cry direction for physicians end
nurses to care for the wounded.
Charles H. Julian, who was shot in the
lf-g. died shortly after reaching a room,
death beir.g due to loss of blood and the
shock to his nervous system. Captain
Golden was removed to a room and made
a statement that Colson was the ag
gressor.
Colonel Colson has long been a promi
nent figure In Kentucky politics. He
served tyro terms in Congress and de
clined a rt-nomination at the hands of the
Republicans of the Eleventh District in
ISM in order to accept the colonelcy of the
Fourth Kentucky Regiment In the Span
ish war. Scott was a lieutenant and
Golden was captain of a cavalry troop in
Colton'p regiment, and the trouble which
led to the tragedy to-day began then. A
feud sprang up between Colson and Scott
while the troops were In camp at Annis
ton. Ala-, and in this, it is .said by Col
son's friends. Captain Golden was a warm
partisan of Scott. The trouble between
them at that time culminated in a meet
ing between them in a restaurant, which
resulted in Colson being shot by Scott.
The regiment was shortly afterward mus
tered out cf the service as a result of t!ie
feud between the officers and the serious
charges and counter-charges which they
had made at Washington against each
other as officers. Since then the parties
had not met until to-day, and it has gen
erally been believed that blood would be
spilled if they met. as both were under
stood to be locking for each other.
Colonel Colson was removed to the resi
dence of Chief Williams while the sur
geons dressed his shattered arm, and he
v.as not taken to Jail until 5 o'clock. He
begged to be allowed ball. The Grand
Jury is in session and an Indictment will
probably be returned against him to-mor
row. Coroner Meagher will also hold an
Inquest to-morrow morning.
Colson to-night declined to talk. He is
In a highly nervofls state and appeared
to have been weeping when a reporter
called. He suffered a partial stroke of
paralysis after he was shot by Scott at
Annlston and had never fully recovered
from it. .
That death seeks a shining mark was
illustrated In the tragedy. . Colson was
the most widely known of those who
figured in it. but none of the others were
obscure. Scott was a . young lawyer of
Somerset and a nephew of ex-Governor
W. O. Bradley, his mother being a sister
of the ex-Governor. Julian was one of
the wealthiest farmers of the county and
was active in local politics, being a Demo
crat. His family were among the best
known people in Kentucky. One brother.
Henry 8., is a lawyer at Kansas City.
Mo., another. Alexander, is a wealthy
shoe, man of Cincinnati, and a cousin
Judpe Ira Julian, of this city, is now a
candidate for the Democratic nomination
for Congress in this district. Demarree.
in addition to being assistant postmaster
at Shtlbyville. was a large real estate
owner. Captain Golden is one of the best
known lawyers In the southeastern part
of the State and has long been a leading
Republican politician of his section. Both
Colson and Scott were ' regarded as dead
game and both had figured in shooting
affrays before.
Fifteen shots went home in the tragedy
to-day. When it is remembered that so
far as known, only three revolvers played
a part in the duel, it can be seen that aim
was for the most part accurate. Colson's
Fhots were true, but this detracts notMn*
from the noted ekill of Scott, because he
emptied his revolver after several bullets
had lodged in him.
Following is the record of the marks
men:
Scottâ Bullet in temple, one in throat,
two in lungs, two in back. .
Demareeâ Two in heart.
Julianâ Bullet in calf of right leg
Cantaln Goldenâ Two bullets in spine.
Colsonâ Bullet splintered left wrist to
elbow, bullets tore his cuff* and sleeves
to shreds.
Nobody not in the line of fire was
touched.
The death of Julian Is the most remark
able. He walked to -his room unaided.
His cousin, Judge Ira Julian, examined
the wound and congratulated him on his
escape. The doctors were busy with the
dying and Julian waited. He was bleeding
to death, however, and when the doctors
turned their attention to him he was past
recovery. Captain Golden waa alive at a
late hour, i

Little Doubt That It Was the Heli

Petroleum Company.
BOSTON, Jan. 16.â The Chamber of
Commerce this afternoon issued a bulletin
saying that part of a ship's boat marked
Heligoland had been picked up off Cape
Pine, N. F., which leads to the belief that
the steamer wrecked at St. Marys Bay
on Thursday last was the German tank
steamer Heligoland. Captain yon Rlttern
which sailed from Philadelphia on Janu

land was built at Newcastle, England, in
IS9O and registers 1563 . tons. She was
owned by the Deutsche-American Petro
leum Company.
ST. JOHNS. N. F., Jan. 16.â Everything
goes to enow that the wrecked steamer Is
the Heligoland, the property of the
Deutsche-American Petroleum Company.
Among a number of flags picked up this
evening near Holy Rood was one with
the colors blue, white and red, with the
letter "R" in the center.
This is the house flag of that company;
Taken with the finding of the boat off
Cape Pine, It seems to leave no doubt
as to the identity of the vessel. A life
buoy was also picked up with the name
of the steamer painted on It, but the let
tering was partly illegible from flre and
water.
In other respects,' however, the day's
operations by the steamers and fishermen
were disappointing. The former had to
abandon work owing to the heavy sea
as they could not approach the wreck.

SENATE RATIFIES
SAMOAN TREATY
Lively Debate Precedes
Its Action.
WASHINGTON. Jan. J6.â The Senate
to-day ratified the Samoan treaty with
out division. The raii:'.cation occurred in
.the executive session after two hours of
delate, which was participated In by a
nurr.ber of Senators. Davis. Foraker and
Spooner advocated, and Bacon, Money
and Tli:raaj;i opposed ratification.
Senator Bacon made the leading speech
In opposition. He based his objection
upon the general ground that it was con
trary to the spirit of our Institutions to
-attempt to govern any people in opposi
tion to their wishes. He said that he was
not opposed to the new convention be
caus* of ar.y partiality Mt for the old
tripartite agreement, which was quite as
repugnant to Rim as the new. He thought,
however, a means might be found to that
end without resorting to a subterfuge
which was repulsive to all American ideas
of liberty and independence. There was
no doubt of th/ intention to annex and
exercise sovereignty in place of the pro
tectorate, which was the distinguishing
, r^ tur Â« Â«f the tripartite agreement of
ihSO. To this proposed change of policy
he objected most strenuously. He cora-
the provisions of the two agree
ments at some length, showing that the
old one made express provision for the
approval of the fiamoan Government of
changes and guaranteed the independence
of the Samoan Government, whereas the
pending instrument .annuls all sovereignty
of the Samoan Government and parti
tions the islands between the United
States and Germany.
Bacon said that the friends of the
treaty supported it upon two groundsâ
that it simply divides authority hereto
fore exercised jointly, and that, the Sa
moan people being "only savages," there
is no reas-on -why they should not be de
spoiled of their country. He contended
that it was not true that the old ar
rangement was simply to be. continued
under a division of authority, and as
serted that the declaration that the Sa
moan people were sa.vaÂ£es was untena
ble. The United States had in many ways
recognised the Samoan Government
guaranteeing its independence and mak
ing a treaty of amity and friendship with
Its Government. We do not, he contin
ued, make treaties of friendship with sav
ttes. He claimed that the proposed
cliange should rot be made without the
consent of the natives.
In conclusion, bacon saJd he was will-
Ing that the United Slates should acquire
the island of Tutila. with its harbor
Pago-Pago, if that could be done In the
proper manner a.nd without violating all
of our principles la securing control of it
Money and Tillman sj>oke on practlcallv
the same lines.
The friends of the treaty repudiated the
assertion that the old treaty provisions
were annulled. They claimed that this '
country by the new arrangement retained
all tht- old advantages and avoided the
complications liable to prow out of the
tripartite agreement. They urged that
the opportunity should not bÂ« lost both
to get out of an awkward predicament
and to control in our own right the har
bor of Pago-Pago.
MORMON CHURCH DOES
NOT UPHOLD ROBERTS
Memorial From President Lorenzo
Snow Presented by Bawlins in
the Senate.
. WASHINGTON. Jan. 16.-Senator Raw
11ns to-day presented to the Senate a brief
memorial from President Lorenzo Snow of
the Mormon church on the question of
polygamy. Mr. Snow says he is persuad
ed that there is much misunderstanding
upon this question. lie says that, in ac
cordance with the manifesto of President
\\ oodruff of 18S0. "the church has posi
tively abandoned the practice of polvgamy
or the solemnization of plural marriages
In this State <L*tah) and every other
State,*' and that no member or officer
Thereof has any authority whatever to
perform a plural marriage or enter Into
euch a relation.
"Scr." he continues, "does the church
advise or encourage unlawful cohabita
tion on the part of any of its members.
If. therefore, any member disobeys the
law, either as to polygamy or unlawful
cohabitation, he must bear his own bur
den; or. in other words, be answerable to
the tribunals of the Jand for his action
pertaining thereto."

epeed and capacity was opposed, he snid
because It would go largely to passenger

For Filipino Independence.
WASHINGTON. Jan. ICâ Senator Wel
lington to-day introduced a joint resolu
tion declaring that it Is not the purpose
of this Government to deprive the Fili
pinos of their right of self-government.
It pledges them the protection of the
United States in establishing a republic
when law and order shall be established.
SECRETARY GAGE
AGAIN ASSAILED
His Actions Criticized in
the House.
"WASHINGTON. Jan. 18.â The urgent
deficiency appropriation bill was taken up
In the House to-day under an agreemMit
which limited the general debate to to
day. It was the general expectation that
it would open a stormy debate upon the
question of expansion. In view of the large
army and navy items It contains, but the
members early became very much en
grossed in a discussion of an Item of $150.
000 for rural free delivery. In which all
are* personally interested, and the sub
ject of expansion was barely touched
upon. -Â¦ .
The last hour of the debate was enl:v
ened by an attack by Richardson, the
minority leader, upon the Secretary of
the Treasury for his course in connection
with the pale of the New York custom
house. He rehearsed the â¢ charges that
Secretary Gage had been guilty technical
ly of embezzlement in connection with the
sale of the custom-house in depositing the
proceeds In a national bank whfch V/ns
a Government depository, instead of ; the
treasury of the United States, but said
that this charge would not hold. His pur
pose, he said, was to show that the City
National Bank had been favored on ac
count of the contributions of its directors
to the Republican campaign fund of lsOt>.
and to show that the course of the Secre
tary in allowing the purchase price to re
main in the bank while at the same time
paying rent for the property and keeping
it exempt from taxation was not dealing
fairly with the trust funds of the Gov
ernment.
Hopkins of Illinois championed the
course of the Secretary, declaring that
the letter's reply to the House resolution
answered every charge brought against
him, and displayed business ability that
must meet the approval of all fair-minded
persons. He insisted, furthermore, that
the title to the custom-house "passed
to the bank when it purchased and took
possession of the property, and that it
had not been exempt, from taxation since
it had been purchased.
The debate caused very little excite
ment, and there was no Attempt to renaw
the assault upon the Secretary after Hop
kins closed.
The urgent deficiency bill will be taken
up for consideration under the nve-mlnute
rule to-morrow.
ANTI-IMPERIALISTS
ARE NOT TRAITORS
Senator Vest Opposes the Assump-
tion That No One Should Dispute
* the Administration's Policy.
WASHINGTON, "Jan. 16.â The Senate Is
still in the throes of discussion of the
Philippine question, and apparently, there
Is no near approach to a deliverance upon
the subject. Vest of Missouri to-day
voiced the opinion of many Senators
when he said that such discussion as was
now In progress was of no consequence,
as the country was confronted by a
state of facts that could not be changed
by talk. Â¦
Pettlgrew's resolution of inquiry and
Lodge's substitute for it were laid on the
table to-day and Hoar's general resolu
tion of inquiry as to the facts of the
Philippine war was taken up. An effort
by Pettlgrew to amend it so as to call for
the President's instructions to the Paris
Peace Commissioners led to a prolonged
debate. After the Senate had considered
the matter behind closed doors, the
amendment was rejected by a vote of 41
,to 20.
The debate for the day was concluded
by Vest, who made a notable speech in
opposition to the assumption In . some
quarters that every, man who does not
agree with the policy of the administra
tion is a traitor to his country. Vest
threw into his utterances all the nervous
force and energy and the accomplished
oratorical ability for which he is famed,
and commanded the attention of the Sen
ate throughout.
McLaurin (D) of South Carolina ad
dressed the Senate on the financial ques
tion, making an argument in favor of his
Eroposition to confer authority upon
tate banks to issue circulating notes.
LONG AND BRADFORD
ARGUE FOR A CABLE
Demonstrate the Feasibility of the
Proposed Line From San Fran;
cisco to Manila.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â Secretary
Long and Rear Admiral Bradford appear
ed before the Senate Committee on Naval
Affairs to-day in advocacy of the con
struction of a Pacific cable by the Gov
ernment. The Secretary's statement was
general and related entirely to the feasi
bility of the plan and its advantage over
having the work dene by private enter
prise. Rear Admiral Bradford detailed
the operations of the collier Nero, which
is now engaged in making a preliminary
iurvey of the proposed line west of Hono
lulu. HÂ« said the survey had been com
pleted and the Nero was now on its re
turn, making a "zigzag" survey.
According to the reports made of the
preliminary work, the proposed cable
was entirely practicable. It Is to run
from San Francisco to Honolulu, thence
via the Midway Islands and Guam to Din
gala Bay, Island of Luzon, with a spur
for commercial purposes to Yokohama.
The average depth between Honolulu and
Midway is 2700 fathoms; between Midway
and Guam, 3000, and between Guam and
Luzon, 2SOO. He estimated the cost at
THE SAN ERAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1900.
JlO5O per knot, which, with the amount
necessary for steamers, officers, etc..
would bring the cost up to $10,000,000. HÂ©
estimated the entire length of the cable â¢
at 829-1 knots, which allows 20 per cent for
slack and detours.
In connection with his statement Ad
miral Bradford said that he understood
the average expenses of the "War Depart
ment for messages to Manila to be about
JlOOO per day. and that the total of the
expenditures of. the Navy Department
had amounted to $2G.n00. '*- Â»~

LORD Methuen is credited with having characterized the battle of Modder
River, November 28 last, as "the bloodiest battle of the century," and the
reports generally of the several engagements that have taken place be
tween the British and Boers convey the impression that the slaughter
under the modern methods of warfare is unprecedentedly terrible. For
the purpose of comparison, a statement of .casualties and percentages,' in a
number of battles from Blenheim in 1704 to Tel-el-Keblr in-1882, is given. The
figures are gathered from various sources, but the writer is largely indebted
to a table given by Lieutenant Colgwel Henderson of the British army, in" his
work on Stonewall Jackson. Colonel i Henders'on 1b now on his way to South
Africa as a member of Lord Roberts' staff.
Note â The 'first named combatant In each case is considered as the victor, and as a
rule held the field.
At Albuera. Waterloo and Inkerman, where British troops formed part of the allied
forces, separate returns are given and marked with a â¢.
It must be noted that the' above flyures; Include .only the killed and
wounded. . Â» . Â¦**.Â¦;?Â¦[. .. \.y.' : " : .'
From the battles that have beer/f ought during the present war in South
Africa the returns are as yet Incomplete' in Jdejail, especially as to the Boers,
but the following, taken from official and press reports, are sufficient for the
purpose of comparison. (The figures for each) side are taken from their own
reports when possible.) .
At Modder River November 28 General liord Methuen with 9600 men at
tacked 8500 Boers in their trenches. The British loss in killed and wounded 468
officers and men, less than 6 per cent ;of their force engaged. The Boers re
ported a loss of 100 men. The -battle; is said to have lasted ten hours.
At Stormberg: December 10 General. Gatacre lost 22 killed and 60 wounded
out of 4500 men, less than 2 per cent. 6!x hundred and . seventy- two British
were taken prisoners. The Boers report a loss of 6 killed and 9 wounded out
of 2200 men.
At Magersfonteln December 11 Lord Methuen's force of some 12,000 men
attacked about the same number of Boers. His total loss In killed and wound
ed and prisoners was 963,- less than 9 per cent of the force engaged.
At Tugela River December 15 General Sir Redrers Buller out of some 24.
000 men lost 750 men killed and wounded, a little over 3 per cent, when he
retired from the field, leaving behind eleven guns.
In the face of these figures two conclusions are to be reached. First: That
modern warfare is not so deadly as in times gone by. Second: That the '
staying powers of the British soldiers are not what they were oh former fields.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Senator Perkins Vigorously Opposing
Tree Trade With Puerto
Rico.
Fpecial P'.rpatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â 1n the Senate
committee on Porto Rico to-day Senator
Perkins said he would insist on the floor
of the Senate that duties should be levied
on all goods shipped from Porto Rico to
the Ur.itf-d States, such as sugar, citrus
fruits and tobacco. He contended that
the duty of SO per cent of the present tar
iff rates on these goods should be levied
on Porto Rican products. This will still
give them an advantage of 20 pÂ«r cent.
Senator Perkins told the committee fur
ther that the island would be an expense
to this Government and the principle of
protection demanded a duty on its prod
ucts. Senator Perkins told The Call cor
respondent to-night that his fight for du
ties on various articles was made be
cause he believed they would injure the
industries of California more than the
products of any of the other islands re
cently acquired by the United Slates.
Senator Perkins says the Government
of Porto Rico should be established under
the form of the bill now pending for the
permanent Government of Hawaii.
When the Senate Committee on Postof
fices to-day began consideration of the
nomination? of Postmasters sent to the
Senate by the President a communication
from Senator Gear, who is absent in
lowa, wns read, asking that the repnrt of
the committee on the nomination of Louis
A. Grort to be Postmaster at Los Angeles
be laid aside until his return to Washing
ton. This sort of reQuest is something
new to Senators and Senator Perkins and
Representative Waters were very' much
surprised at the committee's action in de
laying the matter. Senator Perkins says
that he ha* no doubt that Mr. Groff will
be confirmed by the Senate at an early
date.

NOT DISPOSED TO
WORRY ENGLAND
Move to Abrogate Canal
Treaty Delayed.
Epecia.l Dispatch to The CalL
CAXX. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan. 16.-
It is stated authoritatively that no nego
tiations are in progress between the
Vnited States and Great Britain relative
to the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty. There is no doubt, however, that
the administration will again call the at
tention of Great Britain to the subject.
The authorities are inclined to act con
siderately toward Great Britain in view
of the w"ar in South Africa, and nothing
has been done looking to a reopening of
this question or that for a permanent de
limitation cf the Alaskan boundary.
Lord Pauncefote. the British Embassa
dor. called at the State Department to
day and saw Secretary Hay. It waÂ» said
his call had ho reference to the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty or to Nicaragua canal leg
islation pending In Congress.
It is pointed out by diplomats here that
it would be a good stroke of policy for
<ir-at Britain to agr^e to an abrogation
of the treaty at this time, as 6uch action
would indicate to The world as well as to
the people of the United States her friend
liness toward this nation and her desire
to remove an obstacle to the cordial rela
tions existing between the two Govern
ments.
Introduced a bill which contains the fol
lowing items of interest to the Paciflo
Coast:

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JOSE. Jan. 18.â The California
Fruit Growers' Association is prac
tically a reality and will be the con
trolling factor In next year's cured
fruit crop. All day long the fruit
men wrestled with the adoption of
by-laws, and when they adjourned this
afternoon their organization was com
plete, and all that remained for them to
do was to elect a board of eleven direct
ors. Every section of the by-laws was
lucidly discussed. While at times discus
sion waxed hot, this evening ajl the grow
ers are of the opinion that they have
ney*B suggestion was a wise one and upon
a vote being taken the motion prevailed.
It waa decided that organization must be
accomplished no later than. April 1.
It was expected a big fight would occur
over the fixing of the salaries of the
president and executive committeeâ the
former of 5500 per month and the mem
bers of the committee $300 per month. As
soon as the section was read a delegate
moved that the salaries be cut In' two.
The second came in the form of loud
hisses and the matter was dropped. The
section was unanimously adopted. There
upon J. H. Henry stated there was one
question to be decided on which depended
much. In order to get It before the house
The Fruit Growers* Convention as The Call Artist Saw It.
he moved that the consideration of all
other fruits except dried prunes be elim
inated from the articles of incorporation
and the bylaws. The motion was lost.
The following telegram was read to the
convention:
SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Jan. 14.
President Fruit Growers' Conven
tion: It is hoped your convention will
utter powerful protest against pending
reciprocity treaties and tropical fruit
trade. How disastrous that policy
would be to California's fruit, wine,
nut, sugar and wool industries your
delegates know full well. In warrtini?
off this danger we pledge co-operation
of the League of Domestic Producers
throughout the United States. Your
Callfornian interests are identical with
similar interests, also with tobacco and
rice Industries of other sections of this
continent, and we confidently rely upon
your hearty support and reciprocation
of the league's efforts in your behalf.

pers that form the Consolidated Forward-
Ing Company have created a traffic bu
reau. The matter of frelgnt management
has been placed in the hands of former
General Freight Agent Newlin of the
Union Pacific. Mr. Newlin is making a
careful study of the situation. While he
admits there is much to overcome he does
not believe that railroads can arbitrarily
override a cause espoused by the masses.
This closer union of shippers Is the re
sult of the order of the railroads that goes
into effect January 18, by which all ship
ments of fruits, canned goods, raisins,
prunes, grapes, etc., will be arbitrarily
routed. This, according to the statements
that are to-day made, places every ounce
of product except sugar and celery that
Is grown In Southern California In the
hands of the railroads.

CALL. HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Jan. 16.â
Representative Lentz of Ohio Intimated
to-day that papers tending to Bhow that
President McKinley had appointed polyg
amlsts to office in Utah, knowing them to
be polygamlsts, had been removed from
the official flies.
The House Committed on Postofflces
and Post Roads began an investigation
to-day of the charges^ made in a resolu
tion introduced by Mr. Lentz. that the
President had appointed polygamists as
Postmasters in Provo and Logan. Utah.
Lentz said he had been informed that af
fidavits and protests against these ap
pointments, alleging polygamy, had been
filed with the President. "Ho knows no
euch resolutions are on file now, he
added, with special emphasis on the
"now," because Representative Grosvenor
of Ohio had told him they are not.
Lentz declared that hi discussing tha
matter with him, Grosvenor hod said:
"You don't suppose we Republicans havÂ«
been foolish enough to let grass grow
under our feet? As soon as your resolu
tion was Introduced wo instituted a
search all along: the line and found ther*
were no such papers on file."
Representative Gardiner asked Lenta If
he> meant to insinuate that papers had
been removed from files, and he replied:
"I am only repeating what General Gros
venor said."
Grosvenor stated to-night th&t he said
to Lentz Just what the Ohio member has
credited him with saying, but It was ab
surd to construe hla remarks as meaning
that there had been damaging papers on
file which had been removed. He meant
Just what he had said, that Republicans
had searched files and had found therd
were no papers charging these men with
being polygamlsts.

My Dear Sir: We, the California delegation
in Congress, desire to express our gratification
that a savel made from wood and gold of our
State has been presented to you by your friends
in San Francisco and Oakland. You belong to
the great "West, beyond the Mississippi, which
for the first time is represented In the position
which you now occupy. It has seemed particu
larly fitting that the gavel which you use
should also come from the West and from that
part of It which has always stood for so mucn
in the history of the Republican party and the
The gavel which you will wield Is made of
wood from the battleshto Oregon and of gold
duir from California mountains. It is typical or
the material riches of the State and of th*t
greater mental riches which rendered possible
the creation of that wonderful work of men s
hands and brains, the battleship Oregon. JV hen
you wield the gavel you may be sure that it
stands for the loyalty and power of the great
State on the western .verge of the continent ana
for the wealth which will be freely expended to
make that loyalty and power effective.
The flags of Franca. Spain and Mexico once
floated over the region between the Mississippi
and the Pacific Ocean, and your State, as well
as our own. was once foreign territory. TnÂ«
genius of the American people has made of
these apparently barren wastes States rich,
powerful and free, and the gavel that you are
to wield Is evidence that the true American
spirit exist* on the shores of the Pacific as In
the Mississippi Valley and along the coast
of the Atlantic. May it be used by you for
many years, and when you lay it down may It
be with a realization that Its last service was
In the cause of a people richer, stronger and
more happy than when It was first laid upon
the Speaker's table.
The letter was signed by Senator Per
kins and each Representative. The reply
of the general was received by Senator

ADVERTISEMENTS.
AN OBJECT LESSON
In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the quf>ry: Hare yon
never noticed in any large restaurant at
lunch or dinner time the larsre number of
hearty, vigorous old men at the tables:
men whose ages run from 60 to 80 years;
many of them bald and all perhaps gray,
but none of them feeble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle is so common as
to have escaped your observation or com-
ment, but nevertheless it is an object les-
son which means something.
If you will notice what these hearty old
fellows are eating you will observe that
they are not munching bran crackers nor
gingerly picking their way through a
menu card of new f angled health foods;
on the contrary they seem to prefer a
juicy roast of beef, a properly turned loin
of mutton, and even the deadly broiled
lobster is not altogether ignored.
The point of all this is that a vigorous
old age depends upon gooil digestion and
plenty of wholesome food and not upon
dieting and an endeavor to live upon
bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee and
many other good things are rank poisons,
but these cadaverous, sickly looking in-
dividuals are a walking condemnation of
their own theories.
The, matter in a nutshell Is that if tha
stomach secretes the natural digestive
Juices in sufficient quantity any whole-
some food will be promptly digested; if
the stomach does not do so, and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia. Tablets after each meal will
remove all difficulty, because they supply
Just what every weak stomach lacks,
pepsin, hydrochloric acid, diastas* anil
nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and in fact are not
strictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting it
thoroughly and thus gives a much needed
rest and giving an appetite for the next
meal.
Of people who travel 'nine out of ten
use Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing
them to be perfectly safe to use at any
time, and also having found out by ex-
perience that they aro a safeguard
against Indigestion in any form, and eat-
ing as they have to, at a!l hours and all
kinds of food, the traveling public for
years have pinned their faith, to Stuarts
Tablets.
All druggists sell them at 50 cents for
full sized packages and any druggist from
Maine to California, if his opinion wera
asked, will say that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets is the most popular and success-
ful remedy for any stomach trouble.
A little booklet on stomach diseases
mailed free by addressing F. A. Stuart
Co.. Marshall. Mich.
! formed the strongest organization of Its
kind on the coast. ,
The control of the California Fruit
Growers' Association will lie in a directo
rate of eleven, who will delegate their
power to an executive committee of four,
comprising three directors and the presi
dent as an ex-offlcio member. The presi
dent will receive a salary of $500 and each
director $300 per month. The principal
place of business is San Jose. The direct
ors are authorized to borrow $200,000, and
this in reality will be the working capi
tal of the association. The constitution
provides that the president and vice pres
ident shall be elected by the stockholders,
and they and the directors shall be nom
inated at a convention that shall be held
thirty days before the election. No prox
ies are allowed, but all members may
vote by mail. But one condition of organi
zation is Inserted, and that is to the eftect
that 75 per cent of the acreage of prunes
must come under control of the associa
tion before It shall be considered oper
ative. No trouble Is anticipated in secur
ing control of the crop. Sixty-five per
cent of the dried prunes are raised in
Santa Clara County, and the other 10 per
cent can beyond doubt be easily secured
throughout the State. No time will be
lost In commencing operations so as to
handle next year's crops. Warehouses
and packing-houses will have to be erect
ed and the State thoroughly canvassed.
The association completed to-day is un
doubtedly the strongest ever formed on
the coast. It is patterned after the Raisin
Growers' Association. Judge Bond, the
chairman of the convention, will probably
be offered the presidency of tbÂ« associa
tion.
At the opening of the convention this
morning the fruit men were in a merry
mood over the work accomplished yester
day and they entered into the proceedings
with a dash and spirit. Chairman Bond
called the convention together at 9:30. The
church was crowded and the attendanco
was fully as large as that af the first
day. Many ladles were also present.
The consideration of the by-laws, which
was up before the meeting at the hour of
adjournment, was the first matter consid
ered. F. M. Gordon of Fresno wanted the
name of tho association changed to the
California Cured Fruit Association. He
received no support and the matter was
dropped. The first fight over the adoption
of by-laws was on the section limiting the
credit that the board of directors may cre
ate to $25,000. M. Theo. Kearney stated
this amourtf. was too small to give the
directors a good working capital. He
moved an amendment inoreaslng to $200,
000 the indebtedness that may be incurred
G. W. Hume supported the amendment,
while Mr. Rudolph opposed the increased
liability. E. T. Pettit wanted to know
if 75 per cent of the acreage of the prune
crop would be secured by the association
before an attempt would be made to use
this larger capital.
In the opinion of A. H. Naftzger of LoÂ«
Angeles $25,000 would be sufficient at first.
If it wu round this would. not be suffi
cient working capital a meeting of the
association could De called and a change
made. Chairman Bond said Mr. Keax-
Chairman of League of Domestic Pro
ducers.
Chairman Bond named Colonel Phllo
Hersey, C. W. Chllds and A. R. Spiagrue
a committee to draw up resolutions In ac
cordance with tha telegram.
On motion of R. W. Mantz a committee
of twenty-one was appointed by tho chair
to make nominations for the eleven direc
tors. Tho committee was as follows: W.
H. Alken J. E. Abbott. G. C. Rodell.
Judge B. G. Hurlburt, E. T. Pettlt. G. B.
Hyde, C. F. Freltag, James Farwfill. F.
M. Woods, John Robertson, Jacob Miller,
R, W. Mantz. T. A. Jacobs, H. B. Stabler,
F. M. Righter, E. A. Wllcox, Thomas
Hardle, J. P. Dunne, EX Hutchlnson, F.
L. Gordon and A. J. Gallaway.
Adjournment was then taken till 19
o'clock to-morrow.
It is said that six of the eleven directors
will be selected from San Joss, as this Is
to be the headquarters of the association.
Among the local growers spoken of aÂ»
probable directors are Judge Bond, C. W.
Childs, S. P. Sanders, R. Hersey, Judge
J. R. Lewis, L. C. â¢ Graham and A- B.
Fletcher.
ThÂ© holding of a convention of the green
fruit men has been abandoned, and many
who came here to assist In forming such
an organization have gone home disgust
ed. Others were so deeply engrossed in
the work of the dried fruit men that it
was impossible to get them together.
Many think the organization formed to
day will prove tho salvation of the greon
fruit men as well as that of tho dried
fruit men, and green fruit men all over
the coast will carefully watch the work
ings of the California Fruit Growers' As
sociation. About 200 prune growers have
joined the association. These Include the
largest growers in the State and repre
sent thousands of acres of prunes.

At. One Dollar per share stock in cither the California Standard
OH Company or Giant Oil Company can now be secured. Control-
ling, as they do, 1300 acres patented land in the heart of the McKit-
. trick district, and their first well producing 150 barrels per day, \yith
a record of over 250 barrels under increased pumping pressure with-
out apparent diminishment, of the supply, the directors will now
offer a limited number of shares at the above price, the money thua
received to be expended in further development. The California
Standard and Giant Companies are fully equipped with all necessary
machiner>'r having three Standard rigs of their own, oil and water
pipes, and immense storage tanks directly at the depot. Twenty-two
men are employed on the three new wells, which are now down close
to the Oil Sand, and, with others being drilled, it is safe to say the
production will soon rival that of the largest companies in the State.
. . WE MEAN WHAT WE SAYâ only a limited amount of stock will
be sold at $1.00 per share. Permits to inspect the wells and prop-
erty of the company can be had at any time. Daily trains commence

FETJD BETWEEN TONGS BREAKS
OUT AGAIN WITH FUBY.
The highbinder? were at work again
last night in Chinatown. A Suey Sing man
was shot and seriously Injured by three
members cf the Hop Sing Tonic despite
the precautions which have b*?Â«n taken
by the police. The assassins found their
victim in the home of a friend ct -1 Stone
street, a short alley off Jackson, near
Powell, and fired twice at him througn a
window. The i>!ar.s; for th<s attempted
murder were well laid, the men who com
mitted the deed having remel and occu
pied a houMS immediately adjoining the?
scene of the affair for the part threfl
weeks, that they might Ktody the move
ments of the man on whose head a prico
had been placed and spill his blood ai the
lirst opportunity.
The crime v,as the first act of vengeance
dealt out by the Hop i-ingr*. They nave
been preparing to MriKe lor some time
and to secure, revenge from their rivals
for the death of five men and the maim
ing of another. More trouble is sure t<j
follow, and the truce whim was effected
a couple of weeks ago has beÂ«?a annulled
tind forgotten. The Merchants' Associa
tion, the Six Companies and the Chinese
Consul are working earnestly to plaos a
damj^r on the high-handed crime, nnd
will soon arrange tor the handing over
nf hired murderers to the police au'.hon
tles. Monday night the Merchants' Asso
ciation offered a reward of Jsu for each
gleam of information received, and at :i
meeting of the Six Companies held laFt
evening and attended by the Consul Gen
eral, it was decided that if the tongs <lid
not cease the taking of life, the high
binders would be turned over to the pouce
by the. Chinese themselves.
Last night about it o'clock Ton Gum,
who has also been known to the police
under the aliases at' Horn Ah Gin and
Horn How. and who was arrc-Fted a short
time ago for burglary, was sitting in a
room at 21 Stone fitn-i-t with Wong iiin
and Chin Chun. He had been in the place
about two hours when two bullets were
driven through the window, one passing
through his right thigh and imbedding
Itself in the hip of the left, and the other
passing Immediately under the left arm
and tearing sway a portion Â«>f his coat,
but not injuring him. The assailants,
three in number, then returned to the
house whirh they have been occupying
for the pfiirt thr*-* week* and in which the
plans of the attempted assassinations
were devised and r-pcaped. Immediately
after the Fhots were fired neighbors saw
a lipht in the windows of the- hiphbinder
trvstirg place When the rooms were
pearehf-d by the police afterward nothing
lem&ine-d but a portion of a candle, ana
the men had flown.
What precipitated the last clash was
the attempt of the Hop Sir.g men to mur
der a Suey Sing named I^ec Wong in
Waverly place on Sunday nipht. Wong
was stabbed at from behind and his arm
Feverely slashed. The Buey Sinpp retall
eted by murdering a man in the Jackson
fireet Theater Monday night, and it was
their rivals' turn npain last r.isht.
At the City Receiving Hospital, where
Ton Gum was taken, it was found that he
was not rianct-rout-ly wounded. He pr-r-
F'ftrrtly denies that he belonps to any
ton*, but states that he has been keeping
company with a couple of Su^y Sing men.
He Hfi !b* shntP were inf-mU-d for an
rther man, but his Btenr is disregarded by
the police, who know ho is a highbinder
&nd who have rerfiwd information that
the man has a bad reputation and has
recently Ix-en in jail for a felony. The
wounded man If a momkr of the Chinese
parlor of Native Sons and resided on
Stockton Ftr>'ct. He was recently em
ployed by the Tcsla Coal Company at

Final Hearing of the Suit Against
Biggy Will Be Heard Friday.
Those Arrested Plead
Not Cruilty.
In statu auo Is the condition the litiga
tion between Lillian Dale, keeper of the
notorious Hotel Nymphia, and Acting
Chief Biggy and the rest of the force will
remain in until the fair plaintiff has an
opportunity to strengthen her various al
legations with numerous affidavits. Biggy
yesterday filed his answer to Lillian's
petition for a writ of injunction prohibit
ing him from damaging, her establish
ment, jailing her painted "boarders" and
scattering the ribald pajrops of the den,
and Judge. Murasky called the matter for
hearing. "j
Colonel T. F. Barry and John J. Barrett,
who represent the Police Department, de
manded that the temporary restraining
order heretofore issued against Biggy be
dissolved, but this demand was success
fully'combated by Attorneys J. J. Dunne
and E. L. Pistolesl. Dunne said that the
filing of the answer, which denied all of
the equities of the complaint, did not con
clude the plaintiff, but final Judgment on
the writ must be rendered after aue hear
ing He asKed for time in which to tile
affidavits in support of his petition and
against the answer. After prolonged ar
gument the court granted his motion for
time and set the case for Friday for fur

The cases of the inmates of the Hotel
Nymphia, arrested for vagrancy and be
ing inmates of a house of ill-repute, were
called in Judge Cabaniss 1 court yesterday
afternoon. The prosecution had selected
the case of May Russell to be nrst tried,
but Attorney Pistoles! presented a doc
tor's certificate that she was sick and
unable to appear in court. It was de
cided to waive her appearance and Pis
tolesl commenced with his objections.
He first objected to Colonel T. F. Barry
and Attorney John J. Barrett appearing
for the prosecution, as the charter provid
ed that no attorney who had been less
than two years practicing before the Su
preme Court could practice in the Police
Court. The two lawyers smiled and the
Judge overruled the objection. Then he
objected that they were not attaches of
the District Attorney's office and the ob
jection was overruled. Then he presented
an affidavit in which it was alleged that
the court had no jurisdiction, as the ar
rests were made by Acting Chief of Po
lice Biggy and there was no such officer.
That was overruled and he concluded by
entering a demurrer to the complaint,
which was overruled.
The prosecution Insisted that each of
the thirty-four defendants should be call
ed upon to plead and when two did s<j,
entering a plea of not guilty, Pistolesl ob
jected to the defendants being subjected
to the "contumely and scorn" of those

to plead for the others.
A Jury was demanded and the case of
May Russell was set for trial next Wed

DISSENSION
AND STRIFE
AT TANFORAN
J. C. Kirkpatrick Resigns
From the Stewards.
Trouble Ahead.
From all that can be learned Tanforan
Park is threatened with the same fate â¢
that befell Ingleside track. Aroused to
the fact that the itinerant horde of "rub
bers," swipes and hangers-on about a
racetrack are not the most desirable ten
ants, the aeople of San Mateo County are
up in arms, and demand that the curse
be abolished.
These protests could not be Idly passed
by, and the Supervisors of the sister coun
ty decided to take action. So determined
were these o.ilcials. that, it Is said. W.
J. Martin, president of the Western Turf
Association, promised that If adverse
measures were delayed Tanforan Park
will close down for the season at tho ftnd
of the present week.
Internal dissensions are also rife In thÂ«
association. As a consequence, J. C.
Kirkpatrick. manager of the Palace Hotel
and a member of the Board of Stewards
of the Western Turf Association, yester
day tendered his resignation", thoroughly
disgusted with the workings of Corrigan
and his colleagues. Mr. Kirkpatrick is one
of the representative turfmen of this
State, and there must have been some
grave measures for his action.
Corrigan and Crocker will now resort to
desperate measures to reopen Ingleside
track, and the Hawthorne clan smilingly
say everything is all "fixed." The track
will be opened, and it is expected arrests
will follow. A restraining injunction will
then be prayed for. and the law will be
violated and laughed at. This was tried
once before and failed, and it remains Xt
be seen what the future will bring.

TO FIGHT FOR THE BOERS.
Cornelius i^ane, a burly laborer, was
sent yesterday to the County Jail for six
months by Judge Conlan on a charge of
battery, the court expressing regret that
he could not make the sentence six years.
Lane, while under the influence of
liquor, on December 19 last met Miss Liz
zie Stewart of 210 l 2l 2 Sixth street on Fifth
street, near Mission. He did not know
her. and without the slightest provocation
struck hfr several times, knocking her
down and kicking her.
Lane explained to the Judge that he
had that day joined a number of men
who were going to tight for the Boers,
and he drank so much on the strength of
it that he did not know what he was do
ing. If the Judge would only let him go
to South Africa he would not trouble the
city any more.
"This is not the firs* time," said the
Judge, "that you have been arrested for
beating other pc-ople. You were going to
Tipht lor the Boers and you thought yod
would experiment upon a woman. I will
give you six months, and I am gorry 1
can't give you six years."
ATHLETES OF WEIGHT AND MUSCLE
WHO WILL BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY
stretch. Xot quite up to a hard race, she
finished a close third.
The Burns & Waterhouse stable was
very sweet on the chances of Dunfree to
win the two-year-old spin, and the young
ster went to the post favorite, with Rath
gar second choice. Andrattus, a 40 to 1
shot backed to 20, soon showed in front
after the start, and joined further down
the line by Rathgar and Kingstelle. the
trio fought it out, finishing heads apart in
the order named. Thf> favorite was fifth.
Introduced to slower company in the six
furlong run, the friends of Ben Led! got
4 to 1 about the filly, and she won all the
way. Good Hope ran a game race, hang
ing at the winner's saddle skirts passing
the judges, Revanna, Â¦ the lukewarm
choice, brought up among the "also
rans."
An awful cheap assortment of horse
flesh made up the fifth number, a five and
a half furlong sprint. Corrigan's Joe Mc-
Gee started favorite and won grinning
from Free Pass, a 50 to 1 chance. Antler,
a strong tip, fell into show.
Installator came out of retirement and
was installed favorite for the last chapter.
Jones hustled the Brutus horse from the
start, but could not get inside the money.
Joe Piggott, astride Momentum, came
from behind, beating out Viorls over a
length. Corrigan's Afghan ran third.
Track Notes.
On all of its hangers the Tanforan Asso
ciation announces that tho last two cars
of the trains conveying passengers to and
from the track are reserved for ladies and
their escorts. Nothing is further from
being the truth.- As soon as the pates are
opened women are roughly jostled about
and seats in these cars filled by touts, in
cipient plungers and gaunt-looking "dope"
fiends, who make a living "flimflamming"
the female racegoer. Most of these wor
thies consider themselves above ' the or
dinary track patron and slumber on the
cushioned seats, while women are com
pelled to stand up.
Following are the entries and weights
for the Belmont stakes to be decided to

POTENTE AT
SHORT ODDS
HEADED OUT
One of the warmest things bowled over
at Tanf orari* Park yesterday was Potente,
8 to 10 favorite for the mile selling run.
With 95 pounds and T. Walsh on his back,
the handicappers were a unit in declaring
him unbeatable. Tod Walsh sawed wood
for half a mile, and then moved up to sec
ond position. When the stretch was reach
ed he hauled in the gang plank, put on all
Â¦team and headed for the wire. Just
about the earns time. Jack Martin gave
The Fretter a couple of solar-plexus kicks
and the pair locked horns. In a fierce
drive Jack outjockeyed Tod, landing the
long shot winner by a head in 1:394, a
new. track record. The Lady promised big
things at the start, finished third.
This was not' the only surprise, Andrat
tus taking the two-year-old scramble In
a triple head finish with Rathgar and
Kingstelle. at odds of 40 to 1. Headwater
and Joe McGee were the only winning
choices. ' .
Trainer Charley' Saunders had a first
out "prep" on Headwater, and at odds of
7 to 10, the fast peldlng downed Mounte
bank a head for the opening live furlong
dash. Ella Boland also made her initial
appearance this season, leading to the

HENRI PETRI.
PETER VELTOES.
i^is=^N the Sth of next month Oakland will be the scene of a snorting event of considerable magnitude, when the size of
(f j] the contestants is considered. Two giant athletes of the* Athens of the Pacific will engage in a Greco-Roman
\LJ) wrestling match for $100 a side and a division of the gate receipts.
=iy The two principals in this event are Henri Petri, whose weight is 233 pounds, and Peter Veltoes, who tips the
scales at ten pounds more than his adversary. Petri is a butcher, while Yeltoes is a drummer for a wholesale liquor
house.
Petri, when at work, thinks nothing of lifting a whole beef carcass, while Veltoes can toss a barrel of whisky over
his head as easily as a bakery chef can toss a llapjack. They are both clever in the science of wrestling, and this,
allied to their tremendous weight and great strength, should make the struggle for supremacy one to/ delight tho
hearts of those who enjoy seeing a llerce struggle.
Al Lean is taking care of Petri and getting him in condition for the match, while Jack "Williamson, the middle
weight champion of the Reliance Club, is looking after Veltoes.

ST. LOUIS JOBBERS
MAKE DIRE THREATS
TALKING OF FREE FREIGHTS TO
THE COAST.
. ;: â ; â¢ s
Story That They Will Offer Rebates
on the Large Scale Indicated
Not Generally Credited.
A rumor is current in the business com
munity of a threat upon the part of lead
ing hardware jobbers of St. Louis. If the
decision before the Interstate Commerce
Commission in what has been known as
the "St. Louis suit" should not be satis
factory to the Middle West jobbers they
will enter into the fight for Pacific Coast
business on the basis of free freights to
California, to be made by rebates suffl
cient'to cover all the freights. In other
words, the proposition would be to give
the retailers of the Pacittc Coast the
goods at the same price that they are
now laid down In St. Louis. Inquiry was
made among the leading hardware houses
of this city yesterday to get verification
of the story, but no one was found who
professed to have any knowledge of the
matter. Nevertheless, ' the i rumor was
credited by-some merchants of the city.
If such a move should be made there
would probably be a war at home among
the Jobbers of California and the Middle
West Jobbers, having the immediate re
sult of giving the lowest rates for hard
ware that have been made for. some time
The story was viewed in' several ways
by merchants. One was that if the. Ht.
Louis house could attempt any such pro
gramme, then that settled the question
for good as to whether the rates were
oppressive as against St. Louis. During
the search for Information the fact came
to light that the St. Louis people have
been sending out circulars to . the retail
trade and the hardware Jobbers of other
Middle West points have also been circu
lating literature to a large extent. In
one of the pamphlets is a statement that
the merchants of ban Francisco were
"trying to limit, the markets in which the
retailer might purchase"; also the state
ments that the Pacific Coast Jobbers had
entered into an agreement -with trans
continental, railroads for the avowedpur
pose of discriminating against the mer
chants, of the Middle West, and for forc
ing the retailers in the region west of
the Rocky Mountains to buy their stocks
from the California and Oregon Jobbers
The threat to lay down goods freight
free in California is credited to the Sim
mons Hardware Company of St. Louis

UNION PRINTING ONLY.
Supervisors' Committee Decides a
Resolution Must Stand.
The Supervisors' Printing Committee
yesterday decided that it had no power to
rescind a resolution .passed by the last
board requiring all city printing to bear
the union label of the Allied' Trades Coun-
cil.
A communication from the San Fran-
cisco Typothetae was presented by its
president, N. A. Judd. asking for the re-
peal of the resolution and pleading that
all offices be given an equal chance. Presi-
dent Gibb of the Typographical Union
urged the committee to stand by the reso-
lution and it was so decided, as under the
charter all orders and resolutions hereto-
fore regularly passed by the board are in
full force and effect.
Chairman Booth stated that after con-
sultation with the Mayor satisfactory ar-
rangements had been made with the Star-
Prfss, which has the contract for printing
the new charter, and the work will be
pushed to rapid completion." . ; â¢

JUDGE MOGAN WANTS
MORE STENOGRAPHERS
EDITOR MANCINI'S TRIAL HAD
TO BE POSTPONED.
Courtroom Crowded With Members
of the Local Italian Colony in
Anticipation of a Sen
sation.
The opening of the trial of G. Mancini,
editor of a paper entitled La Critica, on a
charge of attempted extortion preferred
by Dr. A. de Lucis, a prominent member
of the local Italian colony, brought out
a large number of their countrymen yes
terday and Judge Mogan's courtroom
was packed to overflowing. A venire of
fifty had been impaneled for jury duty
and It required more than an hour to se
cure the necessary" twelve.
The plaintiff was represented by Assist
ant Prosecuting Attorney Isaac Harris
and Attorney \V. M. Madden, the defend
ant by James A. Devoto and Percy V.
Long. The efforts of both sides were con
centrated in an endeavor to secure per
sons who had never served on a jury
hitherto, and such was their success that
eight of the twelve chosen were laugh
ingly classified as "fledglings." Frederick
F. Runyon was peremptorily discharged
because he had once been a newspaper
reporter, and thereafter Madden took the
pains to Inquire if anybody else had ever
been.
The jury as finally sworn In .was com
posed of the following: H. Kirschman,
J. C. Butchard, R. Drady, M. H. Deaming,
R. Mills. L. A. Schwarbacher. C. Mc-
Lauchlan. C. Miller, C. Obedina, P. Key
ser and T. Flood. Despite the objections
of the prosecution. Judge Mogan ordered
the trial postponed until next Tuesday at
2 o'clock in the afternoon.
"The new charter provides for only two
court reporters for four Police Courts,'!
he said, "and as they are both employed
elsewhere we cannot proceed. I hope this
provision of the charter will soon be rem
edied, as It should be."
A request for a night session also proved
In vain. His Honor declared that the
night air In the courtroom was so charged
with sewer gas and other noxious vapors
as not only to be exceedingly unpleasant
but dangerous to health. He had been ill
two or three times, he said, from holding
night sessions, and he didn't want any
more of it.
Dr. de Lucis filed a charge of attempted
extortion against Mancini on November 10
last, alleging that the defendant had tried
to force him to pay 5100 on the penalty of
having a story detrimental to his good
name published. Much interest Is taken
in the trial by the local Italian colony.

MAYOR VETOES
THE ORDER TO
TAX TELEPHONES
He Believes It to Be
Impracticable.
COMPROMISE .IS OFFERED
?
RECONSTRUCTION OF SYSTEM
WOULD BE NECESSARY.
The order recently passed by the last
Board of Supervisors imposing a penalty
on telephone companies In all cases where
the nickel was exacted and the party or
number called for did not respond, was
yesterday vetoed by Mayor Phelan. : The
order was intended to put a stop to the
petty exactions of the telephone monopoly
which had 'become most exasperating' to
a long-suffering public. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .
The Mayor states in hla letter contain
ing the veto that he believes the order is
desirable legislation, but acknowledges
that he vetoed it because of certain rep
resentations made to him in a communi
cation by the president of the telephone
company. The latter predicted all sorts
of direful results should the proposed
measure become a law and succeeded in
convincing his Honor that it would be for
the best interests of the public to allow
the company to continue its course in col
lecting nickels for defective service. In
cidentally the company promises to do
better In the future and offer 3 a compro
mise to its patrons which will probably
never be fulfilled. Following is the full
text of the Mayor's veto:
January 15, 1900.
To the Board of Supervisors of the City and
County of San Franciscoâ l herewith return
without my approval Order No. 277, prohibiting
the charging or receiving of any compensation
by a company for the use of a telephone be
fore the party called for. answers.
I regret to return this order without my ap
proval because- the object it seeks to attain
is a very desirable one; that Is, to Insure the
party calling another on the telephone the.ser
vice he seeks before the -payment of the com
pensation. I have examined the effect of the
order carefully and find that it is Impracticable,
and that the telephone company Is willing to
make other concessions which should first be
tried before so drastic a remedy as the one
involved in this order be enacted into law. Â¦
The objection raised is that the telephone
company could not comply with the order with
out doubling the number of thoir operators and
the machinery provided for the ordinary main
tenance of their business. If they were forced
to do thia they say they could not give the
telephone service to the city at the same price
they are now charging, and they claim that the
nickel service is, as compared to rates in other
parts of the country, a cheap and popular ser
vice. It is necessary to understand the opera
tion of the nickel telephone to see the force
of the objection. When, for Instance, a party
is called, the intermediate telephone station
asks that the nickel be dropped in the slot,
which, when done, by some mechanical con
trivance, a lamp is lighted at the intermedi
ate station. Indicating that the money has been
paid. It is not until then that central is rung
up by the Intermediate station and asked to
bring the party called for to the telephone.
Now. if there was any way pf indicating to the
central station direct that the nickel had been
dropped the order could be easily enforced and
compiled with. Hut the telephone company
claims, and their statement Is verified by the
City Engineer, who has been consulted by me,
that without reconstruction of their system
such a result cannot be attained. . .
Now. by the adoption of this order, of course
we could enforce, unless there be lesal obstacles
which have been set up, a reconstruction of the
system to effect the desired result. But the
company realizes that the failure sometimes to
get the party called Is dne of the defects of a
nickel telephone, and offers the city this com
promise, which I believe is worthy of trial:
If the party called does not come to the tele
phone the company will, first, continue to make
an effort to get the said party during the day.
If the subscriber does not desire this to be done
the company will at once make a switch to
another number, and thus the party wanted
may be found. If the latter proposition Is not
agreeable, then the company will give the call
ing subscriber a credit on its books for one
switch, which credit will be deducted from the
subscriber's next bill. As there are upward of
11,000 nickel telephones in use In the city, this
matter Interests a large number of people; and
if the remedy proposed by the telephony com
pany is not effective, and complaintÃ are still
continued to be made, then we should be ad
vised of it, and if no other remedy Is proposed
we can fall back upon this order and require
the company to reconstruct their system if they
still desire to operate the nickel telephones.
Before the board, however, acts upon this
veto I would respectfully request that the
proper committee investigate thin question on
their own account. I have Riven it as much
time as I had at my disposal, but I would like
to have an investigation and a confirmation of
the facts. In this connection I herewith trans
mit to you a copy, of the letter of the telephone
company agreeing to a compromise, and also a
copy of the so-called Ogden ordinance, received
by me from the Mayor of Ogden, and whose le
gality was established by the Supreme Court of
Utah in the case of the City of Ogden vs. Cross
man (53, Pac. Rep.). The latter refers to the
license order now before you Imposing a tax of
50 cents a quarter on all telephones. Concern
ing the propriety of a license tax on telephones
I have recently made recommendations ln'my
Inaugural message.' Respectfully submitted,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
FIFTY YEARS
OF COMMERCE
IN THIS CITY
Half Century Meeting
of the Chamber.
> Â¦
HARBOR FRONT CONSIDERED
D. B. SHEATH STRIKES AT PRES
ENT EXTRAVAGANCE.
Fifty years ago a small body of busi
ness men formed the Chamber of Com
merce of this city. Yesterday, at the fifti
eth annual meeting of the body. President
Charles Nelson dwelt with emphasis upon
the progress made, not only by the city,
but by the entire State. The meeting was
well attended and the entire session was
consumed in reading the reports of the
several officers and committees.
President Nelson, in his address, fol
lowed the growth of the city from the
59' s to the present time and discoursed
upon the present prosperous outlook for
the entire coast. Special attention was
called to the banks, which were never
sounder than to-day. He said the trans
pacific cable is an urgent necessity; like
wise the projected Nicaragua Canal.
Shipping now, he added, should rejoice
that Shag and Arch rocks are to be de
etrcyed. The harbor and water front
thould be improved, he argued, as ship
ping facilities are not what they should
be.
The shipping of Government supplies
from this port, paid Captain Nelson,
meant much for the welfare of the West-
A branch of the Philadelphia Commer
cial Museum should by. all means be es
tablished In San Francisco. His address
was concluded by a general reference to
the establishment of lighthouses on the
coast of Alaska, to tne trans-Siberian
Railway and the prosperity of the nation.
The report of Secretary E. Scott, who
was re-elected to that office before the
meeting was over, related to the Internal
itftairs of the chamber.
Two reports were made by the special
committee on harbor and waterfront.
The majority, J<Â»hn Dolbeer, W. H. Mars
ton. Edward Kentfield, R. J. Chapman
and Robert Dollar, dealt with their re
cent investigation into the revenue and
expenses of the Harbor Commissioners,
the pressing need of more and better ac
commodations for shipping. The recom
mendation was made that the laws be
changed so as to give the authorities the
right to grant term leases on wharves and
warehouses and that the seawall be ex
tended; also that pile driving and repair
ing be done by contract instead of by the
board. There was also a recommenda
tion, which was adopted, "that in vessels
loaded with general cargo, when no spe
cial quantity is fixed by the charter party,
the minimum quantity to be discharged
per weather working day be two hundred
<2uo) tons, this is necessitated by the
greatly increased size of modern vessels,
the present quantity, one hundred (100)
tons, which is considered the amount al
lowed by the 'custom of the port' being
In our opinion entirely too small."
Another recommendation was that steps
be taken to have the San Francisco city
front placed tinder the control of the city
instead of the Slate.
R. D. Sneath made a minority report. In
which he criticized the extravagance of
those in charge of the city front. For ex
ample, he FaJd. fifteen collectors at $100
a month are employed where one would
be sufficient: eighteen wharfingers are
being paid for work that ten could attend
to. The management of the ferry depot.
Mr. Sneath contended, is not business
like; and where there is loss there should
be gain. He further made suggestions for
the improvement of the management of
the belt railroad.
In concluding the meeting President
Nelson announced the following officers
recently elected, and committees appoint
ed, for the ensuing year:

APPROVAL OF THE CALL'S POSITION.
One Who- Has the City's Interests at Heart Charges the Mayor
With Self-Aggrandizement arid Says He* Certainty Â¦ ; :i-
Does Not Represent the People.
[The Call does not hold itself responsible for the opinions published in
this column, but presents them for whatever value they may have
as communications of general interest.]
Editor Call: I wish to express my appreciation of and tongratulation to
The Call for the positive *tand It has taken toward protecting the political, so
cial and moral purity of this city. It seems to me and to hundreds of brother
Irishmen that Mayor Phelan has turned a complete somersault, and that he has
either willfully ignored his pre-election promises or else he never intended to ful
fill them. In his present attitude he certainly does not represent the people who '
elected .him to office in the belief that he would do all In his power to take the
city government" out of the hands of political schemers and boodlers.
It appears now as if hi? sole ambition is self-aggrandizement and as if he
were willing to sacrifice personal honor that he may lay the foundation for a
political future., He has evidently made alliances with much that Is corrupt,
hoping by so doing to deify Phelan even if it involves the debasing of San Fran
cisco in the eyes of the whole country.
I have never asked Mr. Phelan for the slightest personal or political favor, so
I am certainly not a disappointed offlce-seeksr. I am simply a plain business man,
having the best interests of the city at heart and being anxious for Its pros
perity and progress, JAMES' O'BRIEN'.

NOTABLE DEATHS OF THE DAT
SUDDEN DEATH
OF THE WIFE
OF W.W. FOOTE
Stricken While on a
Pleasure Trip.
NEWS RECEIVED YESTERDAY
News of the death of Mrs. W. W. Foote,
wife of the well-known attorney, reached
this city yesterday from Hongkong. Mrs.
Foote had. been traveling in the Orient
with some of her relatives, and while In
Hongkong was suddenly stricken with
dysentery. Monday night word came to
Mr. Foote's nephew that Mrs. Foote was
dangerously ill and yesterday this omi
nous cablegram was followed with one
announcing her death.
Mr. Foote has been 111 for some time
and has been stopping at the Occidental
Hotel. He knew nothing either of the
sickness or death of his wife, and It was
some time before any one could be found
willing to break the news to him. Ru
dolph Herold.v an old friend of the fam
ily, finally agreed to tell him and, with
Mr. Aldrich. Mr. Foote's nephew, Mr. Ler
man, his partner, and Dr. Williamson
went down to the hotel and told the news
from Japan. .- â¢
It was particularly 'bitter, because It
came upon Mr. Foote's birthday. He had
intended to leave hero for Japan by the
steamer next week and had all his plans
arranged to spend a few weeks with' his
family in China and Japan and then con
tinue on through the Suez canal to Paris,
where he Intended to be at the opening of
the Exposition. -
â¢Mrs. Foote was traveling with' her two
daughtersâ Mlsb Bertha and' Miss Enid,
her mother, Mrs^.T,aylor, and her brother,
Ben Taylor. They left last September
and since then have traveled through a
good part of Japan; some of China .and
down to Manila. They were in Manila
juBt before Christmas. Mrs. Foote re
turned to Hongkong to be there to- meet
her husband, and it was there she was
attacked with the dreaded disease.
The party was staying with Rounaevelle
Wildman, the United. States Consul, who
Is a relative of the. family, and It was
from him the news of her death was re
ceived. The" cablegram also stated that
the family was preparing to come home
on the next J steamer, the Coptic, and
would be Here with the body about the
middle of February.
Mrs. Foote was. the daughter of Chaun
cey Taylor, a lumber merchant and a pio
neer of '49. She was born in Oakland and
resided there all her life. She was "ex
tremely beautiful and at her death, while
not much past middle age, still retained
the charms? of her younger days. She
was a belle of society before her mar
riage about twenty-flve years ago, and
since then she has been a prominent fig
ure in all the. plans and achievements of
the women of Oakland. She leaves five
childrenâ Chauncey Foote. who is In the
employ of the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany; Henry Foote, who is completing his

THE NEW LEADER.
WITH elaborate preceding announcement and
liberal use of that pickle of expectation which
cleans the palate of the country for a new sen
sation Senator Beveridge of Indiana has made his
debut in the Senate as a statesman. It was announced
that in his Philippine speech he would speak for the
administration. In such a matter the administration
is powerless; it can neither deny nor affirm the fact
of an avowed vicarious appearance and incarnation. in
its behalf. It can only 'mark time and finally let its
policy and views be known by its acts.
Senator Beveridge's speech has performed a dis
tinct and valuable service by vindicating the ancient
wisdom which uttered. the aphorism, "Old men for
counsel, young men for war."
His speech was charming in its diction and deliv
er}*. Not often has oratory appeared in the Senate
in a ir.ore cÂ«char.ting decollete. But when a Senator
of the United States sends out sandwich men to an
nounce by placards on their backs and bellies that he
is to speak for the administration of his party he
should be careful of what he says. He must not let
his enthusiasm get its tail over the lines and run
away. He must remember that great policies of gov
ernment cannot be disposed of or promoted in what
an old lady in his. native State called the ad-clap
trap-and-drum style of speech. â¢ Â¦
He was in the Philippines a few weeks and dis
poses of the physiographical feature of the issue by
extolling the climate as one of the finest he ever saw,
leaving the inference that it is adapted to the physical
needs of the white laborer and suited to be his home.
If he had consulted the Spanish records and expe
rience he would have learned that even that rather
tough race has never been able to labor there, though
the Iberian peasant at home is as industrious as a
Switzer or a German, as frugal and as orderly. He
would have also learned that the Spaniards in service
there in the civil war and military duties of govern
ment found a slight excess of two years to be the
limit of safe residence, and beyond that they could
not delay return to their native peninsula to recruit
from the inroads made by the climate.
But it was in his historical review of the archi
pelago that the Senator excelled He ' de
nounced the Catholic education and training and
faith of the people as a superstition, and bundled it
with the reasons* why they are unfit for self-govern
ment. Now an individual Senator or citizen may
have his own views and express them as to the
amount of superstition that has adumbrated the re
ligious idea in its various forms among men. Those
who profess those forms deny that they are the vic
tims of superstition. Indeed superstition, in the com
mon meaning of the term and that which it expresses,
is so abhorrent as an incubus upon the progress of
man as to warrant its extirpation wherever found. If
the people of the. Philippines are dominated by it its
extermination must precede all efforts to domesticate
there a rational form of government. Senator Beve
ridge, speaking for the administration, lumps
Catholicism and superstition together and cms
"Anathema!" Several orthodox Protestant clergy
men have been in the islands and have reported the
spiritual condition of the people, with no allusion to
superstition at all. They have not anywhere inti
mated that celebrating, the seven sacraments of tha
Latin church is any more indication of it than
solemnization of the single sacrament retained and
practiced by themselves.
, But the wisdom of the Wabash sees it differently,
and, with the intrepidity of youth, utters the differ
ence as the voice of the administration. A secular
newspaper takes no pick and choice in religious mat
ters. As it deals with all things of human origin, and
therefore of human interest, it may sometimes out of
its contacts with the sickness and soreness and sor
rows of humanity wish that all the religions were more
religious, but in this special matter its merely secular
mind is moved to inquiry.
The treaty of Paris, made by the administration in
whose name Senator Beveridge shies at superstition
in the prevailing religion of the Philippines^ in ex
press terms safeguards, guarantees, protects and
promises to affirm and defend the rights of the Cath
olic establishment in the Philippines, its privileges,
tenures, titles and property. So, the treaty being
ratified, according to Senator Beveridge the adminis
tration has bound itself to intrench there the super
stition which in its name he denounces in oratory
which might excite the envy of his eloquent pre
decessors, Ned Hannegan, Henry S. Lane and Voor
hees. It is a great honor to be a Senator. It is a
distinction to be the spokesman of an administration.
It is also a good thing for an orator acting in those
honorable capacities to have some knowledge of his
subject and to season its discussion with that homely
condiment, common sense.
before the Britannic Government all pretensions of
sovereignty over the territories of the continent of
Borneo which belong, or which have belonged in the
past, to the Sultan of Sulu- (Jolo). comprising the
neighboring islands of Balabangan, Barfguey and Mala
wali, as well as all those comprised in a zone of three_
marine leagues along the coast, and which, form part
of the territories administered by the company called
'British North Borneo Company? M -r; 1
It is intended the flag shall be hoisted at once over
all of these islands, for it appears there are two small
groups omitted from our treaty with Spain- which are
rightly ours. The principal of these, Cagayan-Jolo, is
said to be strategically of more importance than
Sibitu itself. Captain Chimrho, R. N., while cruising
about tho?e seas in search of coaling stations, visited
the group and gave a very attractive description of it.
Of the principal island, which is twenty-five' miles in
circumference, he said: "I do not know any island
I have seen over the world more favorably situated
for trade, or more suitably adapted for cultivation.
Rice, sugar, cocoa, coffee, maize, potatdes and vege
tables would all grow if cultivated. Cotton and to
bacco were already growing there. The soil is- ex
cellent, rich, of trap formation, with sufficient sand
to make it loose and friable. Cattle of all sorts,
horses, cows, sheep, pigs and poultry, would fatten
and thrive there. Enterprising men, with some Chi
nese labor, would soon make it a valuable island, and
not a disagreeable one to live on."
. It will be seen that we are indebted to the Sultan
of Sulu for putting us on to a good lead. Since the
imperialists seem determined to force us to take up
the white man's burden of conquest in that part of
the world it is gratifying to know we will not have to
weep for more islands to conquer after we finish with
Luzon. It is to be noted, however, that even in this
happy island of Cagayan the British captain based his
statement that it might be made valuable upon the
proviso that it be supplied with Chinese labor.

a lack of certainty of classification, however, that im

MORE ISLANDS FOR US
WHEN the news was received that at the request
of the Sultan of Sulu the American flag had
been hoisted over.Sibitu Island, near Borneo,
it was stated that not only were the Sibitu people
pleased with the performance but that the Borneo
authorities were also satisfied. It now appears the
Borneo folks had nothing to say about the matter,
for the island was ours already, having been granted
to us along with the Philippines by Spain.
According to the Washington correspondent of the
New York Tribune there was something of a mystery
abouf the island which has now been solved by the
State Department. At the time of the treaty of peace
the Spanish Commissioners did not notify our Com
missioners of the full extent of Spanish sovereignty
in Sulu Sea, and we were therefore unaware of the
boundaries of our possessions obtained there. It has
now come to light that son* years ago. a treaty was
arranged between Great Britain and Spain defining
their respective claims in that part of the world, and
by that treaty Great Britain recognized Spanish sov
ereignty over not, Sibitu only but several other
islands in the vicinity. The treaty is interesting and
the sections referring to this subject are sufficiently
brief to be given in full. They run thus:
"Article I â The Governments of Great Britain and
Spain recognize the sovereignty of Spain over the
points effectually occupied as well as those which have
not yet been occupied in the archipelago of Sulu
(Jolo), of which the limits are established in Ar
ticle 11.
"Article llâ The archipelago of Sulu (Jolo) con
forms to the definition contained in Article I of the
treaty signed September 23, 1836. between the Spanish
Government and the Sultan of Sulu (Jolo), compris
ing all the islands which arc found between the west
ern extremity of Mindanao on the one hand and the
continent of Borneo and the island of Poragua
(Palawan) on the other, with the exception of those
which are Indicated in Article 111.
Vlt is intended that the islands of Balabac.and of
Cagayan-Jolo form part of the archipelago.

MORE POWER NEEDED.
ONCE more the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has made in its annual report a plea for
larger powers in dealing with railroad ques
tions, and supported it with valid argument Again
atid again the commission has shown that the author
ity now vested in it is utterly inadequate to the needs
of the service. The defects of the law have seriously
interfered with the work of the commission in the
past, and. it is said, existing conditions and the de
velopments of the past year have rendered effective
legislation more imperative than ever.
The commerce and the industries of the people are
affected by transportation companies in a thousand
ways. The unjust discriminations granted to favored
shippers injure the trade of the public generally, and
tte frequent fluctuations and changes in freight rates
caused by railway rivalries disturb business and
often render it unprofitable. Moreover, the various
classifications of freight adopted by different roads in
different parts of the country cause vexation and loss.
All of these evils it should be in the power 'of the In~
tcrstate Co:nmerce Commission to remedy.
At a public dinner in Chicago some time ago the
Hon. A. M. Knapp, chairman of the commission, .is
report ed to have said: "I undertake to say that if the
worst enemy of the railroads whom you can name
were elected President of the United States, and if
he should pack the Interstate Commerce Commission
with the worst p opulists of the land, those men would
never dare to do the reckless and indecent things
which the managers of the railroads themselves have
done."' Mr. Knapp then went on to point out some
of the gTOFs instances of railway discrimination
against whole communities by which the interests of
thousands of people were injured, and he closed by
saying: "In such things the railroads are making
a fearful misuse of their power."
That language is strong, but not stronger than the
subject deserves. Railway management has become
one of the grossest mismanagements of the country,
Â»nd it is time to provide a remedy. The Interstate
Commerce Commission has shown its fitness to in
vestigate the evils and should be given power to act.

PROBLEM OF THE PUERTORIQUENOS.
Q CCORDING to the Board of Geographical
I y Names the people of Porto Rico are to be
?* -/called Puertoriquenos. It is a hard name to
give them,' but not so hard as some other things we
have given .them, and, moreover, it is of their own
choosing, while in many of the other matters they
have had no choice. For example, there is the trade
problem of the island. That is an issue whose hard
ness is perplexing to every one who feels called upon
to consider it.
According to the testimony of General Davis,
Military Governor of the island, the exports of the
Puertoriquenos have, by the acts of our Government,
been reduced from an average value of $16,000,000
prior to 1898 to about $3,500,000 in 1899. This de
crease in trade revenues, together with the devasta
tion and loss caused by the great hurricane, have
produced widespread distress among the people, and
they arc in dire need of more money and more busi
ness.
Such being the situation in that beautiful colony of
ours, there comes up to Congress the question, What
shall be done about it? It has been suggested by the
administration that the trade of the islanders could
be put at once into a flourishing condition by giving
them free access to our markets for all their, products.
Those who favor that plan argue that free trade, with
Porto Rico would not be injurious to any of our own
industries, because Porto Rico does not produce
enough of sugar or tobacco to materially affect the
market.
It is to be noted that those who take that view of
the subject look upon it from the standpoint of the
Eastern States. The States that produce sugar, to
bacco and fruit are not quite so sure there is no dan
ger in the competition. Porto Rico's exports of such
products may be small, but there are other islands â
Cuba, Hawaii and the Philippines â which also pro
duce fruit, tobacco and sugar, and as the privileges
granted to Porto Rico are likely to be granted to the
others, the prospects of the free trade plan are not
so pleasing when viewed from the Pacific " Coast
States, or the Southern States, or any of the sugar
beet States, as when seen from New York or Penn
sylvania.
Moreover, it appears the Puertoriquenos do not
wish free trade with us. Their principal product is
coffee, and the most profitable market for it is in
Europe. According to one of the leading papers of
the island, the San Juan' News, "the people of the
United States are not educated up to the fine quality
of Porto Rica"n coffee, which does not command a
price in American markets equal to that offered by
European buyers." It is stated that in 1898 France
took about $2,000,000 worth of coffee from- the island,
Germany about $1,000,000, while the United States
took but little over $220,000 worth. It is argued that
if French and German goods are shut out of Porto
Rico those nations will retaliate by shutting the cof
fee of the island out of their market. The Puerto
riqucnos therefore ask, first, free trade with Germany
and France, and, second, that the United States ad
vance their Government a loan of $20,000,000 for the
purpose of. making public improvements.
. These varieties of opinion have given rise to a
large amount of discussion. Perhaps the best thing
which has been said on the subject is the statement of
the New York Press: "Our first essay in colonial
government will, if the administration's policy of
free trade is adopted, result like* the attempt of the
elephant to adopt a brood of motherless partridges.
It will again point the moral that we are not nil
qualified to run an orphan asylum. The more the
recommendations unfortunately adopted by the Pres
ident are examined the more they appear to be de
signed to injure every interest involved, inclusive of
the Porto Rican and exclusive only of those of the
American Sugar Refining Company." Â¦

STARS FOR CARRIERS
FOR LONG SERVICE
NEW ORDER BY THE POSTMAS
TER GENERAL.
Old-Timers May Be Distinguished by
Their Uniforms, but They Will
Not Be Pensioned on
Retirement.
Postmaster Montague has been .notified
by the Postmaster General that carriers
hereafter will . wear stars instead of
stripes on their sleeves to denote the time
of service, as follows: Five years, one
black star; ten years, two black stars;
fifteen years, one red star; twenty years,
two red stars; twenty-five years, one sil
ver star; thirty years, two silver stars;
thlrty-nve years, one gold star; forty
years, two gold stars. These stars will be
of silk," three quarters of an inch In diam
eter, and worn on the sleeve Just above
the cuff.
Substitute letter-carriers will be desig
nated by a black cloth bar above the
black braid on each sleeve.
O. 11. Johnson, carrier 29, station C, is
the oldest carrier in. the service in this
city. He was appointed July 1, 1573, and is
entitled to wear the silver star. H. O.
Perry comes next, having been appointed
December 1, 1875. He is entitled to wear
two red stars until next December, when
he will change them for one silver star.
The next In length of service are R. E.
Williams. A. B. Reed, R. D. Cunningham,
Jamea H. Smith, J. â¢M. Smith, W. B.
Chamberlain and W. P. Spencer. They
are entitled to two red stars.
After the third year carriers receive
salaries of $1000 per annum. There Is
neither increase nor hope after that. No
pensions are paid, and when a carrier be
comes superannuated and used up he will
be retired from the service at his own ex
pense.

Lawrence Campbell, employed by the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
purchased an eighth ticket. No. 723*2, for
60 cents in the December 28 drawing of
the lottery of the Beneficencia Publlca
Company. City of Mexico, this number
winning $611,000, his share being $i5OO.
Another fortunate investor was Robert
Oberdeener, stationer of 18 First street.
San Francisco, who Invested $1 in a quar
ter ticket No. -IC4C6, in the same lottery
and drawing, which won the third capital
prize of $10,000, his share being $2300. Both
of the above umounts were promptly paid
to the fortunate owners.
Only a few months ago B. F. Shaw, a
druggist in Virginia City, Nev., and J. J.
Sonecal. cleik at Armand Cailleau, 114
Kearny street, San Francisco, won $15,000
each in the lottery of the Beneficencia
Publlca Company. City of Mexico, both of
which amounts were promptly paid.
The great popularity of the lottery of
the Bencflcencia Publlca Company, City
of Mexico, on this coast is due largely to
the fact .that many of its capital prizes
have been won here.
The drawings of the above named lot
tery were held in public under the super
vision of the Federal officers, the Govern
ment appointing Antonio Perez for the
Treasury Department and Apollnar Cas
tillo Intervenor; therefore everybody was
assured of the honesty of the old reliable
lottery of the Beneficencia Publlca Com
pany of the City of Mexico, the only one
guaranteed and protected by the national
Government, of which U. Bassettl is pres
ident and manager.

ENGINEER TO BE ARRESTED
â - , ?
THOMAS PATTON LITERALLY
BROKEN TO PIECES.
The Southern Pacific added two more
victims to Its crimson list yesterday fore
noon. The first was Thomas Patton, aged
73 years, a shoemaker, residing at 125 Sa
dowa street, Ocean View. The old man
was in the act of crossing the railroad
track at Ocean View when the 9 o'clock
southbound train hove in sight. Whether
he utterly lost his head and stood still or
made an attempt to save himself is not
certain, but at all events he was struck
by the engine and knocked down. En
gineer J. J. Rockwell and Conductor G>
S. Smith were in charge of train at the
time and not thinking that Patton's in
juries were serious went on their way.
The injured man was conveyed to the
Cfty and County Hospital, where Dr. Mc-
Coy made an examination and found a
bad fracture of the right arm and a se
vere lacerated wound In the side of the
head. Patton's injuries were dressed and
everything done tor his comfort, but he
passed away at 8 o'clock last night.
The second victim was a messenger boy
named Benjamin Bernard, residing at 324
Ellis street. Bernard, who is but 18 years
of age was stealing a ride on the brake
beam of the train to Tanforan racetrack,
and attempted to get from beneath the
car when the train slowed down at Bos
worth-street crossing. The train started
ahead suddenly just as he sv.ung himself
outward, and he was thrown beneath the
wheels. He was hurriedly taken to the
City and County Hospital, where, after a
careful examination of his mangled limbs,
Drs Maher and Morton found It neces
sary to amputate his right leg at the knee
and a portion of the left foot The sur
geons nave small hopes of the lad's re
covery. Â¦
Engineer Rockwell, In charge of the
train which killed Pat Ton, will be arrested
to-day upon his return from the south.

TEACHERS MAY NOT BE
PAID FOR VACATIONS
AUDITOR DISCOVERS STARTLING
PROVISION IN CHARTER.
Employes of the City Government
Shall Be Paid Only for the Time
of Their Actual Services.
Consternation prevails In the ranks of
teachers In the public schools owing to
the announcement made yesterday by
Auditor Wells that he will adhere strictly
to the letter of the charter, which pro
vides that no employe of the municipal
government shall be paid for a greater
time than that which he has actually
served. The Auditor holds that it will
be Impossible for him to audit the de
mands for the time In which the teach
ers or other employes are on their vaca
tlonfi. The section of the charter referred
to reads as follows:
Section 33â No deputy, clerk or other
employe of the city and county shall
be paid for a greater time than that
covered by his actual service.
Under this provision the teachers will
be the greatest sufferers if the stand
taken by the Auditor is the correct one.
The teachers are allowed six weeks' va
cation in summer, two in winter, one in
autumn and one in spring, a total of ten
weeks, and unless some remedy be found
they will lose salary for all that time.
The members of the Fire Department
also come under the provisions of the
section referred to. There Is now no leave
of absence fund, as under the consolida
tion act, and they will be obliged to go
without vacations or lose their pay for
the time they are away.
Section 6 imposes* a specific duty upon
the Auditor In signing all demands ana is
as follows: "No demand shall be allowed
by the Auditor in favor of any officer or
employe for the time he shall have ab
sented himself without legal cause from
the duties ot his office during offle'e hours.
The Auditor must always examine on
oath any person receiving a salary from
the city and county touching such ab
sence."
Opportunity
seldom knocks twice at anybody's door. If not seized and made the most of,
conditions generally go from bad to worse. Lost opportunity is bad enough
when financial results only are involved, but it is infinitely more so when
one's health is in the balance. There comes a time when one who is suffer-
ing from Bright's disease of the kidneys cannot be helped. His kidneys are
destroyed and no medicine or man can replace them. But there was a time,
an opportunity given to stop its ravages. Kidney disease manifests itself by
backache, unusual desire to urinate, tired feelings, discolored water showing
sediment on standing, headache, dyspepsia, bad taste in the mouth, short
breath, loss of memory, and many other symptoms. A person may have
one or more of the above indications of kidney trouble or others,, such as
failure of eyesight, rheumatism, chills and fever, constipation, neuralgia, etc.
The foregoing are but symptoms of the real troubleâ diseased kidneys. When
any of the preceding warnings are given, of kidney disease, just then is the
time, the opportunity, to resort to Warner's Safe Cure, a vegetable prepara-
tion, which has stood the test of twenty years in all parts of the world and
cured more people of kidney, liver and urinary diseases than any preparation
ever manufactured.
This great remedy can be procured of your druggist. Accept no substi-
tute. It has been proved in thousands of cases that there is nothing "just
as good."
HUNTINGTON IS
HEADY TO SWING
HIS LITTLE AX
General Decapitation
is Imminent.
â ?
KRUTTSCHNITT IS IN LINE.
- . ?
FILLMORE AND OTHERS ARE
MARKET) FOR SLAUGHTER.
Up In the Southern Pacific building at
Market and Montgomery streets they are
all trembling with the fear of the ax.
That well-edged weapon which Mr. Hunt
ington has swung with such effect in years
past is ready for another descent, and
the favorites of the Crockers and the
Stanfords are marked for the slaughter.
If the reports which these last few days
have leaked out from the "front offices"
prove true, a bigger bunch of decapita
tions has been programmed than ever be
fore in the company's history.
Report has it that scarcely an employe
heretofore rrfalntalned in his position by
the retired interests will be kept. Hunt,
ington has decided to throw out every
member of the anvil chorus .which for
years has "kept up a lusty knocking at
him, his adherents and his Interests. The
day of the faithful has dawned; the va
cancies left by the unfaithful are to be
for the most part filled by imported talent
from the big roads east of the State. Some
of the positions now existing for no other
reason than to supply a desk and a salary
for old pensioners will be abolished. Pro
motions among the present employes, it
is said, will be few.
That a general lopping off of heads was
Imminent has been a matter of general
knowledge among those employed In the
big building ever since H. E. Huntlngton
and Julius Kruttechnitt returned from
the East at Christmas time. Mr. Hunl
lngton while in the East participated in
the stockholders' meetings which resulted
In his august uncle becoming "the whole
thing" in Southern and Central Pacllic af
fairs. He saw the Crockers sold out, and
the Stanfords as well, ai#came back into
the West prepared to take Mr. Crocker's
place in the company.
Mr.. Kruttschnltt attended an entirely
different sort of meeting â one in which
Mr. Huntlngton was also the whole thing,
and it is said that as a result of it Mr.
Kruttschnitt has come back into the West
prepared to pack his grip and remove
nis personal effects from his office just
as soon as he gets the high sign from
New York. Mr. Kruttschnltt ditl not go
to the East upon an invitation from his
chief. Instead he wenc out there in
search of him and an opportunity to
demonstrate the logic of the economical
system by which he. saves the Southern
Pacilic $1000 in operating expenses at a
cost of $10,000. It Is a well-known fact
that Mr. Huntington considers Krutt
schnltt's peculiar system of economy re
sponsible for the remarkable "cycle" of
accidents just now in progress, and that
he all but asked Kruttschnitt for his res
ignation six months ago when his "cycle"
was only fairly started. It was at that
time that the general manager discharged
six men from every section on the system
and precipitated a chapter of the most
disastrous and expensive accidents In the
history of the road. lie also permitted
the roadbed to get in such unsound con
dition that a ride on a lumber wagon was
a luxury compared with six hours In the
best appointed Pullman on the line, and
the kicks that went up from the travel-
Ing public finally found their way to head
quarters, with the result that more ques
tions were asked.
J. A. Fillmore, who, since Kruttschnitt's
elevation, has been actively engaged in
writing passes and cent-a-mile tickets for
employes of the road, is also slated for
the sacrifice, and It is said that the South
ern Pacific land office In the Crocker
building is to be pruned in the places
most atlllcted with the taint of old asso
ciations. A great effort was made to un
seat T. H. Goodman by the local corps of
knockers, but because of his inside knowl
edge of Southern Pacific manipulation
and his faithfulness to the head of the
concern It failed. It was understood that
E. O. McCormlck, the new passenger traf
fic manager, wanted to replace Goodman
with a brand nev/ operator from the East,
and those in the offices who are jealous
of McCormlck's ascendency have tried to
make It appear that he was behind the
scheme to oust the old-time passenger
agent from his position. The operating,
', maintenance of way and the law depart
ments are also to be Included' In the
shake-up, but most of those who are
marked will be given ample time and an
opportunity to offer their resignations.
DESK STUDIES FOR GIRLS: MONEY AFFAIRS.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.
V. PEBSONAL ACCOUNTS ANDi
. MONEY ATFAIRS.
(Concluded:)
Something More About Checks.
If you wish to draw money from your
own account the most approved form ot
check Is written "Pay to the order of
cash." This differs from a check drawn
"Pay to the order of bearer." The paying
teller expects you yourself or some one j
well known to him as your representative I
when you write "Cash." If you write
"Pay to the order, of (your own name)"
you will be required to indorse your own
check before you can get it cashed. Tho
check is simply a written demand upon
the bank for some of your own money,
and when you write "Pay to the order of
cash" it is simply a formal request for
some of your own cash. If. however, you
are giving the check to a tradesman In
payment of a bill you should, of course,
write his name instead of the word
"cash." You are asking the bank to pay
him the money as he (the tradesman) may
"order" it paid.
If you wish to stop the payment of a
check which you have issued you should
notify the bank at once, giving full par
ticulars of the check. You might, for in
stance, give your check in payment of a
bill which you afterward find out to be
wrong or fraudulent. It is better for all
parties concerned, including the bank, if
you exercise proper caution in Usuing
checks.
If you have received a check from some
one in payment of a bill and you deposit
It and it is returned through your bank
marked "No funds," it signifies that the
person whose signature Is attached to the
check has no funds in the bank upon
which the check Is drawn. Your brink
will charge the amount to your account.
The best thing to do in such a case is to
hold the check as evidence of the d*bt
and write to the person from whom you
received the check, stating the facts and
asking for the cash In some other form.
Banks have a custom, after paying and
charging checks, of canceling them by
punching or by making some cut through
their face. These canceled checks are re
turned to the makers at the end of oach
month.
Checks Should Be Numbered.
Checks should be numbered, so that
each can be accounted for. The numbers
are for your convenience, and not for the
convenience of the bank. It is Important
that your check book be correctly kept,
so that you can tell at any time how mucn
money you have In the bank. At the end
of each month your small bank boo*
should be left at the bank, so that the
bookkeeper may balance it. It may hap
pen that your bank book will show a
larger balance than your check book. You
will understand by this, if both have been
correctly kept, that there are checks out
standing which have not yet been pre
sented at your bank for payment. You
can find out which these are by checking
over the paid checks that have been re
turned to you with your bank book. The
unpaid checks may be presented at any
time, so that your actual balance Is that
shown by your Check book. Checks shouM
be presented for payment as soon after
date as possible.
Certified Checks.
If you wish to use your check to pay a
note due at some other bank, or in buying
real estate or stocks or bonds, you nay
ttnd it necessary to get the check certt
fled. This Is done by an officer of rhe
bank, who writes or stamps across the
face of the check the words "Certified"
or "Good when properly indorsed," and
slgnÃ his name. The amount will Imme
diately be deducted from your account,
and the bank, by guaranteeing yoar
check, becomes responsible for Its pay
ment. Banks will . usually certify any
check drawn upon them if the depositor
has the amount called for to his credit.
If you should "get a check certified and
then not use it, deposit It In your bank,
otherwise your account will be short the
amount for which It Is drawn. In Canada
all checks are presented to the "ledger
keeper" for certification before being pre
sented to the paying teller.
Bank Drafts.
Your bank check is really your sight
draft on your bank. Of course It differs
from an ordinary commercial draft not
only in its wording but in its purpose. A.
check is used for paying money to a cred
itor, while a draft is used as a means of
collecting money from a debtor. The bank
Is obliged to pay your check if it haa
funds of yours sufficient to meet it. whila
tho person upon whom your draft la
drawn may or may not honor it at his
pleasure. Banks keep money on deposit
In crÂ« or more other banks located in
some of the commercial centers. Nearly
all large banks keep money on deposit
with one or more of the New York City
banks. They call these banks, their New
York "correspondents." A bank draft 13
simply th" bank's check, drawing on its
deposit with some- other bank. Banks sell
these checks to their customers. Mer
chants make large use of these drafts, or
cashier's checks, a3 they are sometimes
called, in making remittances from one
part of the country to another. A draft
on a foreign bank is commonly called a
"bill of exchange." Â¦
Hints for Depositors.
Do not wait until you get to the bank
to count your money, or to Indorse your
checks and arrange your deposits. Thl3
should be done before vcu come to the
bank, or, at least, before you present
yourself at the receiving teller's window.
Be sure that you have the figures correct.
Place the bills all one way, right side up.
Separate your gold and silver and sort
the silver by denominations. Do not de
posit your dimes, nickels and pennies un
til you have a certain amount of them,
say |5 of each; then put them in a pack
age, with the amount and your nama
marked on It.
Power of Attorney.
To give some one else the power to sign
or indorse checks, notes or other Impor
tant papers is called giving such an one
"power oi attorney"â that is. the power
or authority to be your attorney. Such
authority when given should be in writ
ing and have a witness, and should stat*
explicitly what the "attorney" haa power
to do. The Postoflflce Department issues
a printed blank for use by those who wish
to transfer to others the power to sign
money orders. Powers of this sort should
be filed with the postofflee, or with the
bank Interested, or should be made mat
ters of public record at the office of tho
register of deeds.
Safe Deposit Vaults.
Many of the banks, trust companies and
insurance companies make a special fea
ture of renting small safe deposit boxen
or drawers In their vaults to any and
every person who chooses to pay the rent
asked, which depends larpely on the
amount of space needed, and Is usually
$10 for the smallest sized box. It is very
convenient for one who haa not a safe
of hla own to have a secure place in which
to keep valuable papers. In many of the
larger rafe deposit vaults there are desks
and stationery for customers so that onÂ©
may at any time and very conveniently
and privately examine one's papers ami
make entries or Indorsements, or add
new vouchers, or make changes, as the
occasion may require.
Noteâ These business studies will be
continued next week. Dr. A. S. Bolles of
the University of Pennsylvania will pre
sent "Some Law Points for Girls."

?CEW TORK. Jan. 16.â Professional opera
tions In st<scks fell away considerably to-day
and aa there is po other interest In the mar
ket the dealings made further progree* toward
a condition of Ptagnatlon. There was some
slight er-eculation in Kugar. Tobaco rind the
local tractions, but these represent* 1 little
more than "swapping Jack-knives" among the
Â»>oardroom traders a* may b* Judged from the
cay'p â¢mall net changes. These speculative
favorites are higher on the day after various
fluctuations. There is no better explanation of
their having gone up than that they went
down yesterday. There was evidence of a
desire on the part of ehorts to cover In To
fcacco, which pulled It up sharply In the late
dealings, and the rest of the market with It.
It was *>mphaUcn!!y a waiting market and
was \iy no means clear what it was waiting
for. The fact that the dullness was shared
by the other great speculative centers of the
â¢world give* point to the supposition that the
development of conditions in South Africa is
what is awaited. Money conditions continue to
make progress toward greater ease all over
the world without the slightest effect on specu
lation. A period of stagnation after so drastic
liquidation as that of last month is by no
means unique or abnormal, without counting
the South African situation. It Is very gen
erally believed that a British success there
would cause a sharp rally in prices if for no
other reason than from the covering made by
the bears who have sold the market In the
rplrit of akepticism over any early change In
the situation. It would be necessary to go
liack two years to the time of uncertainty
preceding our war with Spain to find a par
allel for the absolute listlensness or apparent
Â¦waiting which are the characteristics of thÂ«
current stock market. Rates for time money
were Bhsved below 5 p*r cent on choice col
lateral under the Influence of the large ac
cumulation of reserves which Is coming tnto
the New Tork banks.
Dealings in bonds were on a larger scale
than those In Ptocks and prices were more
firmly held. Occasional large Individual tran
sactions reflect the continued flow of capital

WHEATâ The steady decline continues, and
the market eeems to be. without support any
where.
Liverpool was V4d lower. Chicago showed
some strength at the opening. In sympathy with
the drmnfM In Corn and Provisions, and, In
deed, the strength of the former was the only
strong factor in Wheat. There were more buy
ers than sellers at the decline. The market
seemed oversold, but no Improvement was ex
pected unless a better cash demand' appeared.
Later In the day the market weakened off on
Bradstreefs estimate of an Increase of 4,600.000
bushels In the visible supply. Â¦

CHICAGO, Jan. 16.â Two days' business or
lack of it has cost May wheat 29fc@2V4c on the
local Board of Trade. The slump of yester
day received new impetus to-day from the ln
creaee in the visible supply of 4,040,000 bushels.
A moderate increase would have occasioned
little agitation, but the magnitude of the
week's gain announced by Bradstreet's about
noon had a bomb-like effect In shattering
bull expectations. The market had opened
rather heavy In sympathy with the Liverpool
decline. May U@%c under yesterday at 66%@
66Vjc. New York, foreigners and a few locals
had sold "moderately and Home wheat had come
out on stop orders. These offerings had been
well taken and at the decline the market
steadied and advanced possibly In sympathy
with corn. May had touched 66TÂ»c. Business
up to noon had been quiet. Then came the
explosion from Bradstreet'r Holders Joined
the crowd of sellers. " adding concession to con
cession to rid themselves of an article the sup
ply of which waa evidently so much greater
than the demand. The close was at the bot
tom. May lHQlttc under yesterday at 65>4
eBoHc. It was explained that the unexpected
magnitude of the Increase in the visible was
due to a correction of Odessa stocks.
Corn was steady throughout the session and
the close. In view of the wheat break, fairly
firm. May closed a shade over yesterday at
Oats dragged but were fairly steady with
corn. May closing unchanged.
The provision market was Irregular with the
tone easy most of the time on heavy realizing.
Receipts of hogs were over the estimate and
weakened prices at the yards. May pork closed
12V4?Â£15c under yesterday. May lard 12MtC
down and May ribs 7%@10c depressed.
The leading futures ranged aa follows:

London Market.
NTTW YORK, Jan. 18.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
The markets here were idle and featureless
pending the breaking of General Bullet's mys
terious silence. The tone was firm. Americans
were stagnant and the slightest disposition to
buy In them told on prices, owing to the
scarcity of etock. An Illustration was afforded
by the spurt of *i of a point In Norfolk and
Western preferred on the purchase of a few
hundred shares. The Indian Currency Commis
sion "ear-marked" to-day Â£50.000 gold and
there was some demand in the open market
from India for bullion, but no supplies are in
sight. I think Indian exchange, banks will
withdraw bullion to-morrow, probably Â£500,000
during the week, and more â amount doubtfulâ
afterward.
Money and bills were In very Blight demand.
Silver sellers are holding oft fdr Ho more.
The Bank of the Netherlands has reduced Ha
minimum discount rate from 5 to 4% per cent
and the Bank of Bombay has raised Its rate
from 8 to 9 per cent. Copper fortnightly sta
tistics show stocks down 800 tons and sup
plies 552.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs. â¢
Receipts of Eggs are by no means heavy, as
will be seen In another column, and about the
only reason that the market is dropping Is that
It generally does at this time of the year,
which Is no reason at all. Still, both buyers
and sellers look for lower quotations In Janu
ary, so the market goes down whether condi
tions Justify a decline or not. Buyers are hold
ing off . and stocks are slowly accumulating.
There are no more fresh Eastern left and cold
storage are weaker.
Butter shows no further decline, but Dairy
Is very weak. Cheese Is as before.

LONDON, Jan. 18.â The first series of the
wool auction sales this year opened to-day with
a large attendance. Competition at the open-
Ing was rather quiet, but improved later In the
session, especially so with Continental buyers,
who secured the bulk . of the better greasy
merinos. The bidding on scoureds was not so
good, owing to the Inactivity of the home buy
ers. There was a larger representation of
American buyers than usual. The home trade
absorbed the bulk of the greasy, and slips
ruled In buyers' favor with lower qualities
occasionally selling at 5 per cent decline. Cape
of Good Hope and Natal greasy were In large
supply and showed a decline of 5 per cent, al
though most of this class was withdrawn. The
prices realized for scoureds showed little
changes. The number of bales offered to-day
waÂ» 9025. The sale Is scheduled 1 to close Janu
ary 27.
New York Metal Market.
NEW TORK, Jan. 16.â There was a sudden
turn of the undertone of tin to-day and at
the close a feeling of depression prevailed
among sellers. The change was partially due
to weak cables and unfavorable accounts from
producing points here. Other metals were
quiet and destitute of special new features.

The New Tork Commercial cays:
"Trading \t still entirely of a hand-to-mouth
character, and buyers show considerable hesita
tion about taking hold. The effect of this Is to
create a very flow market, but not a weak one.
Holders are all firm in their views regarding
j.rices. and much of the rresent dullness is at
tributable t.i the fact that holders will not
make confessions even on round lots.
The Prune situation is unchanged. Exporters
are buying freely on the coast when they can
get prteeb to puit them, but the liberal pur
chafes of the past week or more have caused
holders to ask more for their goods, and buy
ing is slow at present. There are ample sup
plies, but es well-Informed dealers are of the
opinion that fully one half will be wanted for
oxjurt, no alarm Is felt. In fact, the Indica
tions are now that practically the entire crop
v!:i go out clean l>efore the new one comes In,
<r t.i r.f-arly f* that the quantity remaining
will exert comparatively little influence on the
markets when new goods are offered.-
There are more orders for Peaches, but so far
nc-tual ti-adlnr ha? increased but little. The
price at which stocks are held is so high that
buyers hesitate because they fear a reduction
later. Others say sufh a course Is unlikely,
since a majority of the entire supply is under
close control by strong firms. It is pointed out. I
however, that these firms bought below the !
j resent market and can shade seme and 6tlll
have a profitable margin left.
Apricots are inquired for. but the supply is
In second hands, and very email at that. Move
ment, therefore, is very small. I

NATIONAL GUARD NOTES.
One More Step Toward Getting the
First Regiment in the Guard.
Another step has been taken in the
placing of the First Regiment of In
fantry in the National Guard. To
night four surgeonsâ Drs. .W. D. Mc-
Carthy, P. H. J. Farrell, J. G. Morrisaey
and J. Fitzgibbonsâ by order of Major
General Dickinson reported at the armory
on Page street and the one on Ellis street
for the purpose of making a physical ex
amination of the men who are to enter
the regiment- Companies B and I met at
Page street and C and G at the Ellis
street Armory. Then the other compa
nies were to be examined on the fol
lowing meeting nights: F and Kon
Tuesday, E and H on Wednesday, A and
L on Thursday and D and M on Friday.
It is probable that by the end of the week
the men will have been examined and the
reports will be transmitted to their proper
destination, there to be acted upon.
The rifles that were obtained for the
First Regiment from the Benicia Arse
nal, and which had been stored on the
Marion have been removed from their
place of storage and delivered at the ar
mories. There were thirty-six cases of
these, each case containing twenty
pieces.
The caps ordered by the uniform board
for the Guard have been received from
Philadelphia and are ready for distribu
tion. The "home industry" blouses which
were ordered by vote of Colonel Cutler
and Lieutenant Colonel Geisting of the
uniform board have not yet arrived. These
are the blouses which are to be furnished
by Mandel. Pursch & Co. from their fac
tory in New York City. The contract was
awarded to this firm by the vote of the
two members named at a cost of 20 cents
more per garment than a contract was
awarded to another firm at the same time
for the same kind of goods. The reason
assigned was that the two members
wanted to patronize home Industry. It
turned out that the "home industry" Is
located in New York.

"KING" KELLY WILL
COACH BLUE AND GOLD
PRINCETON" HALF BACK TO
SUCCEED COCHRAN'.
Football Committee Accedes to Fac
ulty Recommendations Abolish
ing Thanksgiving Games
in Can Francisco.
BERKELEY. Jan. 16.â The athletic
committee of tne associated students met
last Monday for the discussion of the
new football regulations and to decide on
a coach for next season. As President
Wheeler did not attend the meeting It
was impossible to come to any definite
conclusion with regard to the new laws,
but in the absence of such decision the
committee determined that there was no
further time to be lost In the selection
of a coach, as Kelly, who seemed to be
the first choice of the members, had other
offers under consideration and had asked
for an immediate answer from California.
Therefore, in the face of the fact that
the faculty recommendations, already
signed by President Jordan and only
awaiting President Wheeler's signature to
become law, forbid the employment of
Eastern coaches, they elected Addison
Kelly of Princeton as head coach for the
blue and gold during the season of IWO.
His salary was fixed at $l.V>O, without ex
penses. This action was opposed by
Colonel Edwards, faculty representative
on the committee, but it seemed the only
course open to the majority of the mem
bers.
Kelly's appointment was considered al
most a foregone conclusion in Berkeley,
where he had made a host of friends
during the past reason while acting as
assistant to Garret Cochran. He is re
panied as representing the highest type
of football expert, having been assigned
his position on the All-America team for
three years in succession while an under
graduate at Princeton.
Kelly entered Yale in ISM and attempted
to enter the football squad. His disabled
foot caught the coach's eyes and he was
informed that they did not care for "crip
ples" on the team. Kelly took the slight
bo much at heart that he left college, en
tered at Princeton and afterward had the
pleasure of repeatedly "rubbing it into"
Yale cm the gridiron and diamond, for he
was the Ftar Princeton halfback and first
baseman all through his college course,
his title of "King" denoting the estimation
in which he was held by his fellow-stu
Â¦ dents.
The action of the committee contem
plates the abolition of the great Thanks
giving day game In San Francisco and
the substitution therefor of a California-
Stanford game on one of the college
campuses on the first or second Saturday
in November, thus materially shortening
the training season, now too long by
Feveral weeks. Such an arrangement
would concede all the points contended
for by the faculty except the abolition of
Eastern coaching and no trouble is anti
cipated in carrying it through. The foot
ball men feel that with our isolation from
the great football centers the game played
here would speedily become antiquated
without expert trainers from the Atlan
tic coast and in this opinion they are sup
jMirtrd hy prominent members of the re
gent.-, faculty and alumni. In yielding the
other points at issue the students are only
following the suppestion of their own best
judgment. It has long been felt that a
$20.0d0 "gate" wan too much money and
that the atmosphere of professionalism
was creeping into university athletics.
Moreover, the heavy expenses necessitat
ed by San Francisco pames make serious
Inroads upon the receipts. It is quite
probablÂ«Â», therefore, that the 30-0 con
test is the laM Thanksgiving day Intercol
legiate football that San Francisco will
Eec for iwrnie time at least. Pringle's elec
tion as captain by the team and Kelly's
appointment ns coach leaves the manager
ait the only prominent football officer yet
to be chosen. This position will be filled
by a general election of the Associated
Students during the. coming term.

MISS MAY BLAYNEY
IN WILDE'S PLAY
mISS MAY BLAYNEY strikes one
immediately. I feel the charm
of her personality before she has
spoken and I ascribe her Infiu-
ence most emphatically to her refinement
of manner and voice. Her voice is the
English voice that we hear about but sel
dom really hear; not the high-pitched ut
terance so many English women are af
fected with, but a voice that is low, sweet
ly modulated and indicative of breeding.
Her manner is also prepossessing and 9he
is a very pretty woman.
In the part of Lady Windermere, which
she is taking in the Alcazar company's
production of Oscar Wilde's play, "Lady
Windermere's Fan," she makes a good
Impression by virtue of these qualities and
acts with admirable reserve and taste.
Her first appearance before an American
audience reflects credit upon her and there
is little justification for her nervousness,
which I am sure she will soon control.
Miss Blayne" is not an actress who can
rise to the heights of passion or strike to
the depths of intensity, but she knows
the value of reserve and pleases with a
multitude of delicate touches that are
perhaps not so much in her art as in her
nature. Her expression of feeling is too
much a matter of quivering from head to
foot, but Hhe finds in the operation no
doubt a safety valve for her nervousness,
which the cordiality of her audience is
sure shortly to dispel.
The play is knten of course. An epi
tome of cleverness, the fabric of which
Is closely knit and the thread of interest
in no wise sacriticed or Blighted for the
sake of the dialogue, which teems with
epigrams. I err perhaps in saying "in no
wise slighted," for in point of fact, there
are some lines introduced that are not
contributory to the plot, but we can for
give Wilde for that consciousness of his
own powers which betrays him into dis
play and which prevents him in common
with all facile and brilliant writers from
doing anything perfectly artistic And,
by the way, it is amusing to note how
in the finish of the third act the charac
teristic cleverness of the author results
in the curtain being roled up several
times to exhibit the mummers who in
terpret it, but who, in spite of their very'
good work, have really little to do with
bringing about the applause.
Hastings, who is Lord Windermere, is
quite interesting in point of sincerity in
the first two acts and again in the last,
but his restraint in the third is, I think,
untrue to the situation and too conspicu
ous to be natural. Mrs. Erylynne In the
hands of Juliet Crosby is symmetrical
and telling, and is but another proof of
her ability. The company is not seriously
deficient. PORTER GARNETT.

MUCH PROPERTY IS
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Hotel and Other Structures at lone
Burned Down, Entailing a Loss
of About $10,000.
STOCKTON, Jan. 16.â About $10,000
worth of property was destroyed at lone
last night by a fire which started In the
oil room of the Mayes (formerly Union)
Hotel, from spontaneous combustion. It
Is believed. The flames were noticed from
across the street by two young men at
11:55 p. m. They gave the alarm in time to
arouse the inmates, all of whom succeed
ed in escaping, though none of them were
able to save anything beyond what they
wore and that was very little in most
cases.
The hotel building, which was of wood,
was totally destroyed, as was the Popu
lar Saloon adjoining. That was also the
property of Mr. Mayes, proprietor of the
hotel. An old stage stable belonging to
John Muldoon, adjoining the saloon, was
also destroyed. It had been used for stor
ing delivery wagons and private vehicles,
all of which were saved. The loss to
the building is about $1000. Hopper's gen
eral merchandise store, a fire-proof build
ing, sustained a loss of $1000. The loss to
the hotel and saloon is estimated at $9000,
besides private losses to inmates, and the
insurance amounts to $3200, $600 of which
is on the saloon.
During the fire Dr. A. L. Adams, one
of the stewards of the Fire- Department,
fell over the fire hose and sustained a
fracture of the leg.

Why Huntington Refused to Endow a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, Jan. 16.â Recently Secre

refusing Mr. Huntingdon penned the fol
lowing:
"I note carefully that you write on the
subject of an endowment or chair in the
institute for $20,000 or upward and In re
sponse to that proposition let me say that
the name of those who come to me for
money for this and other purposes is
legion. My dally mall is largely made up
of appeals for help to relieve actual dis
tress and suggestions similar to yours.
The former calls appeal more strongly to
me, I confess, than do the kind you make,
although I fully recognize the good your
institution ia doing and the admirable
character of Its work. I have done and
am in fact doing a great deal for the
negroes and their schools and I do this
because the negro has not had a fair
chance in the world and he needs not
merely the moral sympathy and support
of the kind-hearted, but their substantial
help to put him on a footing where he
can stand among his fellows and have,
not perhaps an equal show, but at least
a good working chance. There are plenty
of men In the United States who are not
only financially able to help institutions
like yours but are willing and often glad
to do it. as all their sympathies, through
their training and experience. He with
such enterprises. It is because the field
of helpers In other directions seems to
me scanty and I think what money I
have to give away can be bestowed to
greater advantage along lines of more
actual need. The field of my donations
is already so large that I cannot in reason
widen it, hence I do not feel that 1 can
accede to your request."

SAYS A RICH
WIDOW LURED
HER HUSBAND
Sensational Suit of
Mrs. Lane.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
BOS Broadway, Jan. 16.
ThÂ« alteration of a husband's affections
by an aged and wealthy widow Is the
basis cf a sensational damage quit
brought in the Superior Court late this
afternoon by Mr*. Charlotte Lane against
Annie Spiars. Mrs. Lane seeks to recover
$25,000 damapes.
The defendant, Mrs. Spiars. is thÂ«
â¢widow of thÂ«Â» late F. W. Spiars. who at
one time was proprietor of the Philadel
phia restaurant on Broadway. She 1* said
to have passed the sixtieth mi'e stone on
th*Â» roaa to eternity, but nould easily
paps for forty. She is reputed worth some
**V<oo. Her "husband died some three or
four years ago. She resides on High
ftreet.
Mrs. Lane, the plaintiff, is the wife of
Edward Lane, who is a brother of ex-
County Jaiier William Lane. He is at
rr^pent a roadmaster drawing a salary of
$125 per month as an employe of the
county.
The Lanes wrre married at Toronto.
Canada, May 2 i . IS7B. The issue of their
union is represented by five bright chil
dren, respectively: Lillian. S> years: Ed
ward. 17 rears: wHllaxn, M years; Edith,
14 years, and Ethel. 11 years.
According to the complaint, prepared by
Attorneys Chapman ie Cllft. the I-an<>s
lived happily together until last Septem
ber, arhefl the widow Spiars is alleged to
have compassed the breakin* up of their
erstwhile happy home and domestic tran
quillity. The complaint recites:
"That last September the defendant.
Annie Splari, wrongfully contriving and
intending to harass and injure plaintiff
and to deprive her of her husband's af
fections, conjugal society, comfort and
assistance, maliciously enticed him away
frcm plaintiffs and his residence in Ala
meda County to the residence of said de
fendant in the same county and has ever
since there detained and harbored him.
â¢ â¢ â¢ That at all times within the period
of plx years immediately prior to the
commencement of this action said de
fendant we.l knew that plaintiff and said
Edward Lane were husband and wife."
Then follows the allegation that the
erring husband and aged defendant are
basking in each other's smiles contrary
to the, statutes made and provided.
By reason of thus being deprived of her
rightful husband Mrs. Lane avers that
she "has suffered and Is still suffering
great distress of body and mind to her
damage in the sum of 525.000 in lawful
money of the United States of America,"
for which sum she prays judgment.

THE HONGKONG MARU SAILS
The Japanese mall steamer Hongkong

carried some passengers for .Honolulu,

The Hongkong Maru was crowded with
freight, and the China and Algoa, which
follow her, cannot carry all the merchan
dise offering. The Algoa alone will take
away . a general cargo of over 13,000 long
tons.
Potatoes have been very scarce for tne
last week, but now there is likely to be
a glutted market. The Columbia arrived
yesterday with 9000 sacks from Oregon
and the George W. Elder is expected from
the same place to-day with a full cargo.
There is no room for the tubers on tho
Spear street wharf, so the Elder will have
to dock at the sea wall.
Captain John Roberts, late of the
steamer Far.illone, started for the East
yesterday. While In New York he will
purchase a steamer to run ' in conjunc
tion with the Farallone between the
Sound and Cape Nome.
SAYS ESOLA WILL NOT
BE WHITEWASHED.
SAN FRANCISCO,
January 16, 1900.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: In
justice to myself and my asso
ciates I ask you ttfpublish. the
following:
On Monday afternoon Mr.
Fremont Older, the managing
editor of the Bulletin, who had
presented objections to the
appointment of Frederick L. '
Esola as Chief of Police, was
granted " a continuance until
Thursday evening on the ex
press promise of himself and
attorney that the charges pre
sented by him should not in
the meantime be tried by the
newspapers. This promise he
deliberately broke by hi* at
tack on my associates in the
Bulletin of January 16. The
statement that I "saved the
city from disgrace" is absurd,
as my associates and I were
unanimous in granting the
continuance, although all of
. us believed it to be unreason
able.
. The charge that there was
a conspiracy to whitewash
Esola I know to be false.
; Although Mr. Older has for
feited every claim to decent
treatment he ' will receive
every courtesy from the Board
to which he is entitled. Yours
truly, GEO. A. HEW HALL.
SCHOONER ANITA
REPORTED LOST
Gasoline Tank Said to
Have Exploded.
BAN DIEGO. Jan. 16.â A report was
brought to this city to-day by a Mexioan,
who arrived overland from Ensenada,
that the gasoline schooner Anita had been
blown up in Magdalena Bay and that all
on board had perished. The schooner
was owned by the Ybarra Mining Com
pany of Ban Domingo. Lower California,
and has been running between the mine
and this port for some time. She was in
command of Captain H. Funcke, with
Charles Anderson as mate, William For
est engineer, besides three sailors, two of
whom were Mexicans.
The schooner left here oh the 10th of
last month and the ' captain . hoped to
make the round trip and be back in San
Diego by the sth of this month. The re
port is that the gasoline reservoir -ex
ploded as the schooner was entering
Magdalena Bay on her way. up: the coast
and that there was not a member of the
crew left to tell the tale.' The, Mexican
who brought the news, hovrrrer, says
that there was no very definite informa
tion at Ensenada, and friends of the cap-

He Dare Not Deny
Having Made His
Criminal, Ante-Elec
tion Compact
Public Indignation Is
Aroused to Prevent
the Corruption of the
Police Department.
MAYOR PHELAN Is silent under
the lash of public contempt.
He dare not defend his name,
for he sacrificed It when he
made his dishonest compact to
make cf the Police Department a vicious
commodity. The public welfare demanded
that The Call expose him. and under cas
tlgation he squirms in silence. But his
eilence Is no evasion of the issue. The
Call charges him with the commission of
a felony and stands ready to submit in
court the proof of his crime. If he cares
for the good opinion of the people of this
city he must make proper defense or re
clgm the high office which he has dishon
ored. In chis matter The Call has no per
sonal feeling. It has no candidate for the
office of Chief of Police and is concerned
or.ly in striving to secure an honest and
efficient man for the position. This paper
knows that Its duty commands It to voice
a protest agalr.st dishonesty and corrup
tion and that protest will not be silenced
because the offender happens to be Mayor
Thelan.
His Police Commissioners know better
than ever the straight line of their duty.
They can see that they have been hood
winked Into becoming parties to a crim
inal contract, and they certainly do not
Intend that the Mayor shall sell them as
ke has sold others.
They owe it to the city to protect It
T.rora the raid which the Mayor and his
associates planned and they can win the
praise of an action well done by electing
an honest and efficient man to be Chief of
Police. They should elect one who has
not the shadow of suspicion upon him and
who has demonstrated his ability to un
dertake the serious duties of the offlce.
In the discussion of this grave matter
th<Â» character and qualiScations of Fred
erick Lawrence Esola. alias Frederick
Harrington, have In a measure been over
looked. This young man is but an inci
dent in the contemplated outrage upon
the city. He is but a tool in the hands
of cleverer schemers and more daring
manipulators. He is but the representa
tive of criminal and preying classes, who
demand that their depredations upon the
community be legalized.
If It were not for the pledges of con-

iiy authority of his own admissions he
has neither the education, the experience
nor the ability to fill the high office which
he asks. To those that know him and
are familiar with his career the idea of
placing him In charge of the Police De
partment is preposterous. More than that
it is an outrage upon the department it
eelf and will inevitably lead to demorali
zation to give him authority over men
who have far deeper experience than he
and know more thoroughly the grave
duties of the office.
There is in the career of Esola one in
cident which should, once and for all, re
move him from the list of candidates for
Chief of Police. He has already been
tried and is found wanting. He has been
put to the test and has failed. He has
proved himself utterly and dangerously
Â¦unreliable, and the Commissioners cer
tainly will not dare to elevate him to a
position where his unreliability may mean
disaster to vast interests and death to
many people.
A few years ago F. L. Esola was ap
pointed to the position of guard at San
Quentin. It was while acting in that ca
pacity that he committed his grave of
fense. In this matter The Call, rather
than do him an injustice, prefers to un
derstate rather than exaggerate the se
riousness of the affair. The facts are per
fectly clear and the proof is positive.
Esola owed his position as guard to the
Â¦ same influence which is now demanding
his appointment as Chief of Police. In
(seeking the position of guard he sought
a.n occupation which he believed to be in
keeping with his abilities, but after ob
taining it he relied upon an influence,
which threatened blackmail and misrepre
sentation, to keep him In his place.
As a guard at Ban Quentin he neglected
WOMAN SAVED
FROM BEING .
BURIED ALIVE
Her Daughter Warned
in a Dream.
CHICAGO, Jan. 16.â A special to the
Chronicle from Indianapolis. I rid., says:
Mrs. Ellen Crosby has had a narrow es
cape from being burled alive in Crawford
County. She had been pronounced dead
and preparations for the burial were being
made. While these were In progress her
daughter, IS years old, worn out by ex
haustion, lay down to rest, but her eyes
had scarcely closed before she sprang up
and peremptorily insisted that her moth
er's body be returned to the bed. She
remarked that her mother had called to
her in her fleep, saying:
"Mary, don't let them bury me alive."
The undertaker complied with the
daughter's request, saying It was but a
dream: but the daughter stoutly claimed
the contrary and would not be denied.
Nearly eight hours passed, when Mrs.
Crosby Fl<Â»wly opetied her eyes and looked
Bt her daughter, who had remained by her
bedFlde, constantly watching for a return
of life.
Mrs. Crosby is now considered In a fair
Â«ay of recovery.

prison and would want Esola to go with
him on hunting and fishing excursions.
He would make the request of me by sim
ply telling me that he wanted Esola to
accompany him and I would not dare re
fuse. Whenever he came to the office to
make the request Esola seemed to take
It for granted that he could go and would
prepare himself accordingly.
"Esola was discharged from San
Quentin Prison for sleeping at hi 3
post of duty. Patrick Maloney, a
fellow guari. reported this to me
and I informed Warden McComb and
asked for Esola's dismissal. This was
granted, as Esola's laxity was of the
gravest nature. He had an impor
tant post and had no business to for
sake his duties. There were many
escapes at that time owing to tha
class of men employed as guards.
These men were held on by Buckley,
Higgins, Crimmins and other poli
ticians of San Francisco, who got rid
of their worst following by unload
ing them on poor old McComb. I was
frequently jumped because of the nu
merous escapes, but I was not to
blame; it was due to the worthless
ness of the guards.
"When Esola was discharged Lawrence
came Immediately over and asked to be
allowed to Interview a prisoner. As I
knew the convict was unfriendly to the
administration and would state things
that were fruits of a vivid Imagination I
refused to allow Lawrence to see him. I
knew he only wanted to talk to the man
to obtain facts with which to roast the
administration. Lawrence became "angry
and I did also and I Informed him that
he wanted a shotgun, and not a prisoner.
Lawrence never lost an opportunity to
roast Warden McComb and the men under
him. McComb is dead now, but I want to
say that there was never a more honest
official appointed in this State.
"Lawrence was very friendly with me
before Esola was discharged for sleeping
on duty, but after that he would never
speak to me and I have not spoken to him
to this day.
"As a guard Esola was no good in God
Almighty's world, because he relied upon
his pull to hold his Job."
The Police Commission could not in Jus
tice ask more to convince them of the
gross impropriety in choosing Esola for
a position to which by his talents ho is
not entitled. The worthy gentlemen who
are to be responsible for our police ad
ministration may think that it is a mat
ter for congratulation to clean the skirts
of their ,, candidates, but In cleaning they
should take care of their own. They are
asked simply to choose an honest man,
capable by experience and education, to
assume the duties of Chief of Police.
Surely a man with an alias does not pos
sess the qualification of respectability, nor
a guard who sleeps at his post the ability
to control the police affairs of this city.

BIGGY WILL, BE UPHELD.
Raid on Bacon Place Is Com-
mended by Commissioners.
Attorney AcIT talked to the Police Com
missioners for nearly three hours last
night, 1 pleading that the officials would
"wink the other eye" at Bacon place.
Incidentally he discussed the "social evil"
at some length, and wound up by nearly
putting all the Commissioners to sleep.
As the representative of Marie Paris,
who conducts a Bacon place boarding
house, Ach filed charges against Acting
Chief Biggy, Captain Wlttman, Sergeant
Shay and a number of officers, claiming
that they Ijad exceeded their authority
in attempting to crush the evil existing
in the little alley off Pine street. The
matter was heard by the Commissioners
last night, but no decision was reached.
Ach took the ground that the places
occupied by the fallen women of Bacon
place were their homes, and that the po
lice had no right to Invade them, unless
by authority of a warrant. He said that
Mr. Biggy. instead of regulating the so
cial evil, was "stirring up the stink pots
of the city." and depriving a certain class
of their civil rights and their rights to
Sersonal liberty as guaranteed by the
tate constitution.
â¢ A decision was reserved to give Mr.
Ach an opportunity to rurnlsh authori
ties bearing upon his contention. There
was strong intimation that Chief Biggy
would be upheld In his action.
WOOLEN MILLS
ARE PLANNED
FOR EUREKA
Capitalists Trying to
Form a Company.
A. TV. R. Berr is trying to get San Fran
cisco capitalists Interested In the project
of establishing a woolen mill at Eureka,
Humboldt County. The plan is to make a
stock company, and the estimated cost is
about $50,000. This would include the erec
tion of the mill and the placing of the
machinery. There are two reasons why
Eureka has been considered a good place
at which to locate a woolen mill. One is
that tho wool of the northern counties
has been found to be of a superior quality
and the other is that the cost of fuel
would be comparatively low, on account
of the waste from the lumber mills that
could be utilized for the making of steam.
Still another reason is that there is com
munication by water with Eureka, and for
this reason the transportation charges
could be kept down to a minimum.
Among those whom Mr. Berr has tried
to interest In the enterprise is Captain
Charles Nelson. In an interview yester
day Captain Nelson said that he thought
weir of the idea. He believed that a mill
in i Eureka would pay. Slabs could be
bought for 50 cents a load, which, when
they were dried, would make excellent
fuel for steam purposes, equal to coal.
An obstacle to manufacturing enterprises
in other parts of the State had been the
cost â¢of the fuel consumed. He did not
know how far .Jr. Berr had progressed.
A new enterprise of the sort named must
put in the latest machinery. The supply
of wool would be ample, for the ranges of
Humboldt County were large and fur
nished abundant feed for sheep.-
Considerable Interest has been awakened
by the proposition to found another wool
en'mill. Some of the enterprises of that
sort in the State have not been successful,
while others have made money. Mr. Berr.
who is the head of the enterprise for
Eureka, has been engaged in woolen man
ufacturing practically all his life. He has
been the superintendent of the San Jose
TVoolen Mills.

MAYOR PHELAN ON THE STAND.
Called as a "Witness in the Rehfeld
Damage Suit.
Mayor Phelan, apparently worried, took
the stand in Judge Hunt's court yesterday
to give his testimony in the *uit instituted
by Adolph L. Rehfeld to recover damages
from the city and county for the destruc
tion of his property some time ago by a
mob of Tennessee volunteers. The; Mayor
was asked whether or not he was In
formed of the existence of the mob at the
time it was engaged in destroying the
plaintiff's property. He said that, as it
was on a Sunday, he was not In his offices
in the City Hall and was not notified by
the police or any citizen. The Mayor then
left the stand, and after the examination
of witnesses to prove the value of the
destroyed property the case was submit
ted. Judge Hunt will Instruct the Jury
this morning.

liability, this certainly is the -worst. Esola
has by his own volition added an element
of seriousness to this incident, the gravity
of which he recognizes. He has lied in
reference to it and has claimed that be
cause of a disagreement with some of
the officials he resigned his position as
guard. Unfortunately for him, the rec
ords at San Quentin cannot be evaded,
and on February 19, ISB9, there Is this
entry: "v: ;; *:.
Frederick Esola, discharged for
violation of prison rales.
What that violation of prison rules
means was told yesterday by Ben Cham
bers, who was Deputy Warden at San
Quentin when Esola was a guard. Mr.
Chambers is now a rancher in Clarks
burg, Yolo County. When Interviewed
yesterday he said:
. "I was Deputy "Warden at San Quentin
during the administration of McComb. I
think It was in 188S or ISB9. When Mc-
Comb and. myself . came to the prison
Esola was employed there as guard. An
drew M. Lawrence : came to me at that
time and told me that he was specially
Interested in Esola and asked me to do
everything in my power to keep him
there. By his actions and manner, rather
than by what he said, he gave me to
understand that his friendship for the
administration depended upon our keep
ing Esola there as guard.
"Lawrence very frequently visited the

story. .
hls duties, but ever over the heads of the
authorities was that threat of a dishon
est newspaper. Is the same threat now
being used as a lash to make officials dis
honor themselves? Affairs went from bad
to worse in the conduct of Guard Esola
until finally the authorities, fearful of the
most serious consequences, could endure
It no longer, and Frederick L. Esola was
summarily dismissed. He had been
caught Bleeping at his post. He had
thought bo lightly of the responsibility re
posed in him that he had deliberately
Jeopardized the life of every freeman in
San Quentln and had left open an avenue
for the escape and consequent ravage of
hundreds of dangerous convicts.
Do the Police Commissioners wish to
elevate him to a post where he may sleep
again while the town and its . criminals
may run wide open? Do the Police Com
missioners intend to choose a man who
has been unfaithful in the smallest duty
to take charge of affairs that tax the
shrewdest brains and demand unremitting
energy and industry'? Do they intend to
make the Chief of Police, a man who
failed to stand the test of a penitentiary
guard? Do they think that such a m^n
will be equal to the routine of police ad
ministration, much less to the tremen
dous emergencies that may come at any
hour in a great city?
The suggestion is absurd, yet it la but
a very few years 6ince Frederick L. Esola
was dismissed for sleeping at his post.
Of all offenses of incapacity and unre-
to enjoin the board from hearing them,
but the Judgment Is against him.
In his opinion Judge Hunt says: "It ap
pears from the evidence that the charges
preferred by Prescott and Donovan
contained matters of accusation which did
not appear in the charges upon. which
this court passed in its former decision.
Tne gravamen of the former accusation
was the charge that the plaintiff had im
properly used a letter obtained by him
and written by a former School Director,
Wallace, to Director Byrnes; that he had
caused disaffection among the teachers,
and that he signed or approved of an il
legal demand for salary. But the allega
tions contained in the so-called Davidson.
Donovan, Daniels and Warshauer charges
all relate to matter different from and
occurring at a time subsequent to the
first named. I am of the opinion that the
charges last named involve new offenses,
and if proved might well be claimed to
constitute unprofessional conduct. The
present board should not be prohibited
from hearing the charges in proper man
ner, and defendant is awarded Judgment."
It is believed that he was temporarily
Insane when the shootlns was done, aj
he and Schulzo had long been the closest
friends, having been associated with each
other in the business affairs of the bank.
The evidence before tha Coroner's Jury
this afternoon shows that Murphey
placed the pistol close to the temple of
Mr. Schulze and fired. He then thrust the
muzzle into his own mouth and fired, two
balls penetrating his brain.
Captain Murphey was found lying by
the side of the wall, several feet from his
private desk. The blood was streaming
from his mouth and he was dead. As
sistant Cashier Schulze was sitting 1 in the
chair he occupied when the shot waa fired.
His head was lying far back, and from
a frightful hole in his right temple the
blood was dropping to the floor.
