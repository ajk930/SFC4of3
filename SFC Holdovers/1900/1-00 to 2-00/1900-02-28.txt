LONDON, Feb. 27.â The War Office has received the following dis
patch from Lord Roberts:
"PAARDEBERG, Feb. 27 (11 o'clock, Tuesday morning).â
From, information furnished to me daily by the intelligence department
it became apparent that General Cronje's force was becoming more de
pressed and that the discontent of the troops and the discord among the j
leaders vras rapidly increasing. This feeling was doubtless accentuated
by the disappointment caused when the Boer reinforcements which tried
to relieve General Crcnje were defeated by our troops on February 23.
I resolved, therefore, to bring pressure to bear upon the enemy. Each
night the trenches were pushed forward toward the enemy's. Jaager. so .aa^ _
to gracnallycontract his position and at the same time I bombarded.it
heavily with artillery, which was yesterday materially aided by the ar
rival of four six-inch howitzers which I ordered up from De Aar. In
isrrying out these measures a captive balloon gave great assistance by
seeping us informed of the disposition and movements of the enemy.
"At. 3 a. m. tc-day a most dashing advance was made by the Cana
dian regiment and some engineers, supported by the Gordon Highland
;rs and Second Shropshires, resulting in our gaining a point some 600
jrards rearer th; enemy and within about eighty yards of his trenches,
where our men entrenched themselves and maintained their positions
until morning, a gallant deed worthy of our colonial comrades, and which,
I am glad to say, was attended by comparatively slight loss.
"This apparently clinched matters, for at daylight to-day a letter
6ig-ned by Cronje, in which he stated that he surrendered uncondition
ally, was brought to our outposts under a flag of trues.
"In my reply I told General Cronje he must present himself at my
camp and that his forces must come out of "their laager after laying
down their arms. By 7 a. m. I received General Cronje and dispatched
a telegram to you announcing the fact. In the course of conversation he
asked for kind treatment at our hands, and also that his wife, grand
son, private secretary, adjutant and servants might accompany him
wherever he might be sent. I reassured him and told him that his request
would be complied with. I informed him that a r general officer would be
sent with him to Cape Town to insure his being treated with. proper re
spect en route. He will start this afternoon under charge of Major Gen
eral Pirttyman, who will hand him over 'to the general com man ding at
Cap: Town. Â¦Â¦;â¢Â¦# ""-. Â¦ - '
"The prisoners, who number about 3000, will be formed into
commandos under our own officers. They will also leave here to-day,
reaching the Modder River. to-morrow, when they will be railed to Cape
Town in detachments." . . . .
The above dispatch wns read in both the House of Lords and the
House of Commons to-day. The reference to the Canadians evoked im
mense and prolonged cheers.
A. J. Balfour, the Government leader in the House of Commons,
said he had no information relative to the Boer guns.
BOER PRISONERS NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND.
LONDON, Feb. 27.â Lord Roberts reported to the T^arJOfflce that the number of. Boer prisoners approximates 4000,
of which about U5O are citizens of the Orange Free.State. The remainder, are. citizens,^f the Transvaal.

day morning by the Canadians to within eighty yards of the Boer trenches, and the enemy was
compelled to surrender.
All-important questions this morning are: ''What effect will the capitulation have upon the
Boers?" and "What will be Roberts' next move?" This British victory does not mean a collapse
on the part of the Boers. It means the freeing of the Free State forces by" the removal of ' one of
the most skillful commanders and the return to their farms of the weak-kneed, among the
Free Staters, but in the Free State one other seriesof actions at least will have to- be fought,
while the march into the Transvaal means very hard fighting and the loss of' many lives. That
the British Government appreciates this is shown by the announcement that the. Eighth Division
will be sent out so soon as transports are available. .
The consensus oi military opinion-here is that Roberts will; move on Bloemfontein
(French is reported to be already on the way), perhaps sending a strong mounted force to re
lieve Mafeking. It is not thought that- the Boers will make a' stand >t the Free State capital, as
it is not easily defended, but strong positions are to be found on the border of the; two republics.
Buller is finding Boer resistance to -his advance on Ladysmith ' increasing rather than
diminishing, and as yet White has not been able to assist in the movement. In fact "the Boers
are trying to. outflank the British, which attempt, if it succeeds, will" to a great extent justify the
result of the week's fighting. * : S'sf^
GREAT REJOICING IN LONDON.
There was a big crowd in front of the Mansion House cheering wildly as the Lord Mayor approached "with the
Lady Mayoress on the balcony. Shouts of "Cronje surrendered!" "Majuba avenged!" "Hurrah for Bobs!" and "Eng
land for ever!" rang often and loud.
ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES OF BULLER'S TASK.
LONDON, Feb. 28.â A dispatch to the Dally Mail from Pietermaritzberg. dated
Monday, describes at considerable lensth the "enormous difficulties of- General
Buller's task," and says: "The real advance began last Wednesday. The stu
pendous nature, of the task was only understood when, being on the spot, or.o
was - able to realize what it means to hurl Infantry at positions aligned in every
direction with carefully -prepared trenches and wi^h breastworks defended by
practically Invisible riflemen, armed' with "the most deadly rapid-firing weapons
and aided -by quick* firing guns which put all but our cannon of the lightest cal
ibre into the shade." ,;',,.>: ; ; " :
Commenting upon Friday's fighting, the 'Daily' Mall's correspondent says:
"As It would have been madness to seek an outlet from the amphitheater of hills
by way of Groblers Kloof, on the feft. a route had to be found on the right, and
at 2 p.m. on Friday,- amid the incessant crackling of rifle flre and the roar of
cannon', ; the "Irish, brigade was distributed along the river to take Railway Hill
on the other side 'of Pieters Station. This hill is commanding enough to ensure
our final advance, providing we could hold" it securely and could mount -cannon
on it. -From Onderbrook. Spruit railway bridge the track runs along the Tuge:a.
and it- was perilously open to the Eoer marksmen disposed on the kopjes back
from the river, and, after passing Pinters Station many men would be bound to
be hit. \ Beyond the station the. line passes .over another small bridge crossing a
deep donga., and' it was in the appro ich to this bridge and onward to the base
of Railway Hill that the greatest danger from enforced exposure obtained. It
was necessary to cross by the bridge at the mouth of the donga, which, besidfc*
being difficult of access, ran into the Tugela. The path between the. railway and
the river was almost always in fut! view of the enemy. Every man of the IrÂ»3h
brigade had, therefore, to run the ga*mtlet of Boer marksmen, and numbers
dropped on, the bridge where. the Boers' bullets, fell dangerously thick, until tha
bridge was sandbagged and only one man allowed on it at a time. Very soon fifty
men .were put out of action in the race from the bridge to the rendezvous. Bnl
several members â¢of the volunteer ambulance corps were wounded in following
the troops." ?vT *.-%<Â¦--â¢ :-':: -' : - â¢
The Daily Mall has; the.followingfiom Ladysmlth. dated Ladysmlth. Feb. 21:
"Yesterday the: Boer retreat continued. A party of about seventy, en route from
the north, drew rein. for. Limit Hill. A battery, of fifteen pounders, placed not
far off, -suddenly opened 'flre" and practically annihilated the party. A Boer am
bulance was. later, on seen collecting the dead and wounded. The Boers are '.Ty

DISASTROUS ATTEMPT TO CARRY RAILWAY HILL.
LONDON. Feb. 28.â The Dally Mall publishes this dispatch from Its special
correspondent. Richard. Harding Davis:
PIETERS, Feb. 24.â Last night the Innlskilllng Fusiliers, mixed with some
of the Dublin Fusiliers and Connaught Rangers, attempted to carry Railway
Hill from Pleters. They, were under a continuous .fire, through which they
passed up heavy, broken ground to the first Boer trench. Half way up the hill
the Boers . retreated to the crest and then came back on either flank of the Irish
troops, enfilading the captured , trench with a savage cross as well as a direct
fire. All night until 9 o'clock In the morning. the British held the position un
der a ceaseless' fire and at terrible cost. At roll call only five officers and one
hundred men answered to their names. Colonel Thackery and Major Sanders of
the Inniskillings. Colonel Sitwell of the Dublin Fusiliers, Captain Maitland of
the Second Gordons and Colonel Thorold of the -Welch Fusiliers were killed.
Two hundred and fifty-two of the rank and file were killed or wounded. General
Lyttelton's brigade relieved them at 10 o'clock this morning, when the Boer artil
lery, pounded the troops holding the center kopjes without pause, but with lit
tle, effect. Â¦:
CORRESPONDENT MURDERED BY AN OFFICER.

Mafeklng," who 'had: previously been reported as accidentally shot and klllled on
November .2, : was. It appears from the diary of a Morning Post correspondent
and 'from, a letter received by the Daily Chronicle, murdered by Lieutenant
Murchison of the British artillery, reputed to be a man of fine professional abil

and that, when they were strolling across the square, Murchison was seen ta
draw a revolver. and to kill 'his companion. An inquiry was held and a finding of
willful murder was returned. Lieutenant Murchison was tried by court-martial.

LONDON, Feb. 28, sa. m.â Sir Redvers Buller is having a hard
i time in Natal. It is evident that he was misled when he wired
that there was only a weak rear guard between him and Lady

LONDON, Feb. 28. â General .Cronje's unconditional surrender yesterday with 4000 men, in
cluding nearly fifty officers of important" rank and four big guns, is the triumphant, result of
Lord Roberts' strategy. It was a piece of brilliant soldiership,; strongly conceived and per
fectly executed. ' \\i?C-'
Quickly massing together two weeks ago a flying force of cavalry and mounted infantry
10,000 strong, with field guns, he brought up behind Moddcr River his infantry division. Then
he sent French with clouds of cavalry under ordersjto. sweep over, the drifts to Kiniberley, reliev
ing that place.
Cronje found himself outflanked. If he retreated north Methuen and French would have
enveloped him. He was obliged to. give up Kiniberley and ilee to the eastward. On.the night of
the 15th he started on a forced march toward Paardeberg. Accomplishing thirty-tHree miles; ; : in|
one desperate march, he was discerned on the morning of the 1 6th and followed up sharply by the
cavalry. Lord Kitchener and General Kelly-Kenny' caught up with his rear guard, driving it. in
upon the main body, which was outspanned with cattle, weary. and tired men in the bed of the river.
There he was penned in on the 18th. Roberts, at the head of the infantry division, sealed him
up between Koodoosberg and Paardeberg in a trap. -For a whole week the Boer commandos
were shut up between the river banks and stormed at day and; night with . artillery and rifle fire.
Roberts held off the scattered reinforcements and maintained the close, unsparing fire,
which rendered Cronje's position untenable. Finally a dashing advance was made early yester-

During Their Stay In
Helena.
WASHINGTON, Feb: J7.â The proceed
ings of the Senate Comittee on Privileges
and Elections in the case of Senator Clark
of Montana to-day dealt with the bank
accounts of some of the members of the
Montana Legislature. One of these ac
counts was that of Representative)
Stephen Bywater of Flathead -County,
who deposited $15,000 in the Bank oNMon
tana at Helena on March S last after the
adjournment, of the Legislature. By
water was called to the stand. He said
that he had brought $6000 of this sum
to Helena and kept-, it In his trunk
all winter, while $9000 had been received
from his brother as purchase money on a
sale of . mining stocks.) He declared' that
he had not received any pay for his vote
for Clark for the Senate, but' said White
side had told- him that he could get $3000
for supporting Clark. .. ; -,-.-<
Other witnesses of the day were Clerk
Rlckerts of the Montana State Supreme
Court, T. C. Kurtz of the Montana Na
tional Bank, both new witnesses, and At
torney General . Nolan.Whiteslde and D.
G. Peller were recalled. . .
General Nolan Recalled.
! Nolan said he had given small suras of
money to persons who had gone orer tha
State in search of testimony in this case.
The money had been supplied by Camp
bell. He had procured $500 from Camp
bell as a gift from Daly, for the editor of
an agricultural newspaper In ' Helena.
Another item charged to him was $2000,
which had been advanced to pay the ex
penses of witnesses in the Wellcome dis
barment proceedings. This money, had
been received from Campbell and. most of
it advanced to the State Treasurer to se
oure him for the payment of these : ex
penses. Nolan said that he had advised
the State Treasurer to pay these ex
penses upon the assurance that- the ex
penditure would be made good.
Among others to whom 'Nolan's acÂ«
count showed he had paid expense money
for collecting evidence in the disbarment
case was the clerk of the State Supreme
Court. Foster seized upon this fact to put
the witness through a sharp cross-exam
ination to show that .this official was
transcending his official. duties, the case
being before the court of which he was
an official. Nolan said that the clerk had
gone to several points to investigate
evidence. He had paid him $35- purely for
expenses and not as an addition to his
salary. â¢ Â¦
: T. C. Kurtz, cashier of the Montant Na
tional Bank of Helena, was called to the
stand to glvfe testimony concerning - the
bank deposits made by members of the
last Legislature, from August, IS3S, to
September, 1899. He brought the accounts
of Clark and Wellcome. All of them were
referred to a sub-committee for examina
tion.
Whiteslde, the first witness of the case,
and who in some respects may be con
sidered the prosecuting witness, waa le
called for rebuttal purpose*. In reply to
questions, Whiteslde said that he had paid
his own 'expenses In 'this investigat|oÂ»>
amounting to about $2000, and that he had
received but $30 from any other source.
Campbell had loaned him that amount.
Some Big Bank Deposits.
The sub-committee on the accounts In
Kurtz and Peller's hands, having com

the documents should be examined. These
gentlemen were then recalled, and the ac
counts put in. All of . them related: to

THREE DEATHS

Epidemic Breaks Out Again
After a Twelve Days'

Food.
HONOLULU. Feb. 20.â After twelve
dajra ijassiog without a sign of the plague,
three cases were discovered yesterday and
all ended fatally. The victims wer.MÂ»o
Chint-s? -males and a womanâ half Chinese
end hall Hawaiian. "- -â¢ -â¢Â¦
There Is some uncertainty in all the
cases as to the source of the infection,
and the authorities are busily engaged in
trying to discover this. It is almost cer
tain that one of the victims came to his
death through eating Infected food from
a Chinese Etore. It is probable lhat the
case of the woman alto may oe traced to
Infected goods. A part of the block in
which the woman lived was Buspected
bourn time ago and destroyed by fire.
The case of the woman came front 1 , a
tlace in the vicinity of the South Sea
Island srttleiMent and directly in the rear
of the .-mail houses burned notr long- ago
by the Hoard of Health's order. One of
tbese was destroyed because it wan
thought thai a. German who died -there be
fore the plague started in Honolulu had
really been a victim of the disease.
At a meeting of the Board of Health
yesterday President Wood reported that
the funds at their command were exceed
ingly low, and lhat more money for cur
rying on the work of lighting the plague
Â»as immediately necessary. On February
15, out of 1142.0J0 that had been approp:i
ated for the use of the Board of Health,
up 10 that time 113.5.000 was offset In bills.
Consequently but $4600 remained available.
On this statement it was decided to ask
the Council of State for a further appro
priation of $IOO.WO. In the afternoon the
council met and appropriated the neces
sary money. Jn addition the sum of $345,-
KS 24 waÂ« appropriated for the extension
and completion of the sewer system. This
last item was appropriated subject to the
approval of President McKinley.

left here for Hilo, but I return very much
encouraged. It will be possible now to ar
ransre and carry out any scheme made
necessary by events by correspondence,
"I found the people there perfectly calm
and working together to the best possible
end. There was no shotgun business
there, and I do not believe there ever has
been. We were met at the wharf by Mr.
Lyman. There was no appearance af ex
citement of any kind and certainly no in
dication of trouble, past or present.
"I do hope there will not be an epidemic
of plague. at liilo. At the same time, the
scare has done lots of good. In that the
town has been cleaned as it had never
been before. People have worked together
and untiringly to this end. and, though
I had not been there in two years I
could see the result instantly. The situa
tion then* Is all right, and I feel good."
Dr. C. B. Wood, president of the Boa-d
of Health, who returned from Hilo by the
Iroquois on the 16th. believes that the ca3e
fif Mrs. A. G. Serrao. who died there on
the morning of February 6, is very B us
piciouÃ. and before leaving he gave in
structions that the case be treated as one
of plague. Said Dr. Wood:
"I Celt that the only thing to be done
was to treat it as a case of plague. Upon
my orders the ttores of A. G. Serrao ar^i
the house in which the victim was ill ten
days were destroyed by fire. A rat proof
fence had previously been placed around
thf- p ?nises. The ditch or town Â»ev:er
was disinfected with carbolic acid and the
ground around the Serrao store was treat
ed to a solution of the Fame. In addition,
the residents of the premises were re
moved to quarantine."
Portions of the business section of the
town were found to be in a very unsan - ;
tary condition. Buildings and sink ar
rangements were much as they were at
Kahului and fully cue, bad as In Chintaown
of Honolulu. Dr. Wood pointed this out
to the citizens, and suggested to them a
system of inspection as in Honolulu, and
that owners l>e compelled to put treir
premises in proper shape.
At Kahului health conditions were
found to be in good shape. There were
200 persons in the detention camp and all
were found to be in excellent health. A
most careful watch was being kept over
all of the island and indications were that
the situation was fully In hand.' .Vsi.*. .
Settlement of Fire Claims.
President Dole received by the Nippon
Maru an important -dispatch from Wash
ington in regard to the Court 'of Claims
p.nd settlement of losses sustained by
the Chinatown fires. The jnes^age is
from Secretary Hay direct and bears the
instructions of President McKinley. ; ,It.
reads as follows: _ Â¦ â¢ .
Washington, D. C. Feb. 9; 1900.
PrPFident Kanford B. r>ole. Honoluluâ The
Prwident approve? you appointing five persons
to takfr Â«>videnee of losses caused by the burn

I* id out of appropriation made by the Ha
waiian Council .of State In conformity - wltn
Hawaiian laws. " :- .\-\C". . JOHN HAY. .
The question of how President McKin
ley would proceed in the court matter has
been mooted here for days. Some
thoupht a jury would be sent down from
the mainland, or at any rate, the Wash
ington Government would appoint Us
members. President Dole will in a few
days select the five men to serve.
The latter part of the dispatch, re
ferring' to funds, amounts *to nothing: un
less it is the intention of the President to
Invest the Council of State with full legis
lative powers. It states that the dam
aces shall be paid "out of appropriations
made by the Hawaiian Council. of State In
conformity with Hawaiian laws." ' As
settling damages Is not stamping out the
plapue. the Council of State cannot ap
propriate money for the purpose "under
Hawaiian laws."
The dispatch Is significant in that it
seems to Indicate the Investment of
the ' Council of State, at a later time,
with complete powers and authority to
act in all matters until a Legislature be
elected under Territorial laws.

"BRAVO, BOBS,"
AND "MAJUBA"
ARE THE CRIES
LONDON, Feb. 27.â "Majuba Avenged,"
"Cronje Surrenders," "Great British Vic
tory-"" These are the expressions shout
ed to-day. The capitulation -of General
Cronje had been looked upon as almost a
certainty for a week past and now that It
has come enthusiasm finds itself discount
ed by the anticipation.
The magnitude of the success of "Lit

that it synchronized with the anniversary
of Majuba Hill and wipedout a dishonor
of nineteen years' standing. While' the
afternoon papers all comment upon this
happy coincidence, they do not forget the
splendid bravery of the^enemy. -"'.-..

The Westminster Gazette, whlch.is In

"Admiration for the desperate valor of
General Cronje is mingled with anger at
thenepeasity Imposed upon us of purchas
ing victory at this cost. Let us remember
Paardeberg if we like; but forget Majuba
and have ; done with the whole j train jof
misleading associations - and "mischievous
ideas which gathered around that un
happy memory."'.
No one who did -not know of General
Cronje's surrender would suspect from
the appearance of the town that
London was to-day, celebrating the chief
victory of the war. Not a flag is flying
and in front of the places where bulletins
are displayed to the public scarcely more
than a dozen people stop at a time to read
the news. Outside of the War Office there
is the same absence of enthusiasm, which
is due doubtless to the drizzling rain.
In the War Office lobbies, when a* clerk
posted the news of the' surrender. quite a
crowd was waiting, and here the tidings
were hailed with considerable enthusiasm,
and in an incredibly short space of time
the news had spread to all parts of Lon
don. At the Mansion House when the
news was posted It was received- with
great excitement by the crowds of busi
ness men hurrying to their offices, and
cries of "Bravo, Roberts!" and "Majuba!"
were heard.
The Lord Mayor of London said to the
correspondent of the ." Associated Press
that while the surrender, of ; General
Cronje was a foregone conclusion, the
news was received with a great sense of
relief, and the result of the capitulation
he thought would be the rapid conclusion
of hostilities.
At the Stock Exchange there was much
excitement and cheering, but this quickly
subsided when the house opened. Stocks
opened with an upward tendency, but no
material Improvement In prices and con
sols strangely were slightly weaker.
The news of General Cronje's surrender
was received with unbounded satisfaction
at Windsor. The. Queen immediately tel
egraphed her congratulations to Lord
Roberts and the troops.
There was a much 'more outward ' dlp
play of rejoicing in the provinces than in
London. The Glasgow and' Liverpool
Stock Exchanges were greatly, excited.
The members sang "God Save the QueÂ«u"
repeatedly, and cheered for ."Little. Bobs."
Flags were liberally displayed on the
municipal and house buildings in all the
large towns.
. Windsor was very : jubilant at the news,
which the Queen disseminated immediate
ly after it reached her, * and " the i inhabi-
tants seized the occasion of Her. Majesty
driving through; the town on* her way to
take a train for a visit to' the wounded
South African soldiers at the Netley Hos
pital to give vent to their delight.
The Queen, who' was looking.remarka
bly.-; well, showed evident signs of deep
satisfaction, smiling and continually bow
ing in response to the congratulatury
cheers greeting her on all sides. Her
Majesty took quantities of flowers to dis
tribute to the wounded. '
All the garrison towns and naval norts
received the news with the liveliest satis
faction, soldiers and sailors-) vying with
each other in displays of delight. ,

ROBERTS READY FOR
ANOTHER IMPORTANT MOVE
LONDON, Feb. 28.â Spencer "Wilkinson,
reviewing; the military situation In the
light; of General Cronje's capitulation;
says this morning: \ Â¦ :.Â»;.
\ "On a moderate estimate one-tenth of
the Boer, army has been taken out of ac
count by. the. capture of Cronje. The bat
tle of. Paardnberg is a miniature Sedan.
/"To-morrow the whole of Lord Rob
erts' army, say 45,000 men, will be ready
fora^fresh advance, if, -indeed, the start
be. not- made to-day. .The objective must
be the next. Boer army of importance,
which; is in Natal. The next move, there-;
.fore, , with a view of drawing the/Boer
army from Natal, Implfes an advance on
'Bloemfontein, or some 'point. on the rail
5 way '.between" Bloerhf ont-?in a . -, ! and * Wlne

â¢Bloemfontein, so much, the -better. With
45,000 men Lord Roberts may well be able

- force , there.' /'^C ...
'.'The.-effect of the' Paardeberg victory
will probably be a movement northward
of the "Boer" forces ' south "."_â¢ of 'â¢Orange
River. In Natal the. effect will be moral
rather -than strategical. The effect of
elation on the one side and of depression
on the other will be equal for the : mo

have to face a 1a 1 crisis.; If they send troops

CLOSING HOURS
OF PORTO RICAN
TARIFF DEBATE
Friends and Foes of the Bill
Match Oratory in the
House.
Argument Embraces All Phases of
Expansion, Democrats Protest
ing Against the Holding of
the Philippines.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 27.â The general
debate' on the Porto Rico tariff bill closed
to-day in a blaze of glory. The galleries
were crowded to the doors and every seat
on the floor was occupied when the rival
champions of the' respective sides, Dolli
ver of lowa and Bailey of Texas, made the
closing arguments. Each spoke an hour
and a half. The speech of Bailey, devot
ed as it was almost exclusively to the
legal phases of. the. controversy,, while. It
was profound and impressive, did not
arouse the unbounded enthusiasm which
swept the galleries and floors while Dolli
ver was speaking. The lowan was at his
best and his wit, eloquence and sarcasm
in turn drew salvos of applause from his
Republican associates. Before the closing
speeches were made Cannon of Illinois,
chairman -of â¢ the Appropriations -Commit
tee and "one of the veterans "on the Repub
lican side, made an exceptionally effective
speech in support of the. bill. Carmarck
(D.)- of : Tennessee, Clayton (D.) of Ala
bama, Kloberg (D.) of Texas, Pearce and
De Armond (D.) of Missouri made
speeches in opposition to the bill. The
Republican managers are now : confident
that with the modifications agreed upon
at the conference la9t night the bill will
command a narrow majority In the final
vote to-morrow. Â¦ Â¦ '
Clayton of Alabama created much
amusement and enthusiasm by reading a
letter written by Chairman Payne to W.
H. Curtis of Palmyra. N, V., on January
24, 1900, in which he advocated free trade
with Porto Rico on . the ground that it
would give relief to "the stricken island.
The latter contained the following refer
ence to the Philippines:
Under the treaty the Philippine Islands are
to have free trade with Spain for ten years.
We couM not extend these, tariff laws to the
Philippine Islands, even if we would.
Clayton asked that this letter and an
extract from Mr. Payne's speech in sup
port of the bill.be printed in parallel col
umns in the record. Payne smilinely as
sented to the request, and expressed the
hop* that there would be no objection.
Peary of Tennessee declared that the
brood of trusts had flocked to Washing
ton and had compelled the leaders of the
Republican party to turn their backs
upon Porto Rico. He asked if the people
of that island were not entitled to as
much consideration as the Sultan of Sulu.
who was granted free trade with all the
Philippine Islands.
Philippine Policy Denounced.
De Armond of Missouri said this bill pro
posed to set aside the constitution not for
the purpose of doing something philan
thropic, but in the interest of the partial
or complete enslavement of a helpless
people.
"This change of front," he declared,
"has been brought about by the influ
ence of the agents of mighty corpora-
He said the administration had deter
mined blindly and greedily to hold the
Philippines for what could be made out
of them. It mattered little about Porto
Rico. The Porto Ricans were to be cruci
fied in order that the cross mieht tee
raised in the Philippines. -We could with-,
draw from the archipelago and leave
10.000,000 tropical people to work out their
own salvation. . !
"In my opinion," said he, "that is what
we ought to do." . (Democratic applause.)
He thought the time was coming when
there would be a revulsion in the Repub
lican party, when the" Republicans who
now had the backbone to oppose the pres
ent programme would be hailed as the ;
saviors of their party.
Cannon of Illinois followed De Armond. :
He scouted the cry that had been raised :
that the trusts had dictated the bill. He [
charged that both the tobacco and sugar
stored in Porto Rico was already owned .
by the - sugar and tobacco trusts. They
had. put forward some natives as stool
pigeons to beg for free trade, so that
I while the Democrats cried out against the
trusts they would be voting for them.
"Their voice would be the voice of Jacob,
but their hand would be the hand of
Esau."
Bailey- of Texas made an exhaustive
argument against the constitutionality of
the bill,* arousing the lawyers on the
other side so that* fora time he was al
most .continuously engaged in crossing
swords; with one or the other of his ad
versaries. . . ' .... \ .

D.olliver :ot'lowa: ot'Iowa closed the debate for
the. majority. â¢:, Said he :

* made" to tndode- the whole problem of the gov-"
â¢ernment-of .all territory acquired by us by the
treaty of Paris. - ' .;_ ? .... . -
It was declared that this bill was in
behalf -of- -the sugar trust, when the fact
.was, declared - Dolliver. that -the sugar
trust, wanted free, trade. The-same was
true of the tobacco trust. He continued?
â¢ If the constitution of the United States es
tablishes free Â¦ trade between Manila and Saa
Francisco, .;**Â¦. it undoubtedly does between
Maryland and Virginia, then the fact that 'we,
have got Into a. new competition is only the.
leant trouble that has been before us. We are
in that case disarmed at once in the momentous;
demand which this nation has .made for equal;
rights Jn the â¢ commerce of Asia.' I. violate, no
secret r of . this Government when I say that to
day there Is pending in the State -Department
the most- elaborate commercial negotiation ever
attempted in the history of our diplomacy,
based on a, pledge made by our commissioners
at- Paris that whatever we did in the Pacific
Ocean we wculd maintain an open door for the
commerce of the world. And I want to ask
Republicans and those Democrats from the
great cotton belt of the South who are looking
forward to the opportunities that are wrapped
up In our commerce in the Pacific Ocean in
time to come, with what countenance can we
stand before the cabinets of Europe, protecting
against the occupation of the ports of China
to the prejudice of American trade, when we
ourselves from our headquarters on the bor
der being carried away by our own constitu
tion have deliberately drawn a commercial
deadline about the Philippines for the perma
nent exclusion of everybody else. The open
door of Asia, through which the enlightened
community of American business, North and
South, looks forward to opportunities not even
yet explored, the opportunities that shall
broaden with the centuries, that is the real
question that is on trial here.
Dolliver then defended .the President's
course in the Philippines, read General
Lawton's letter charging that the Insur
rection in the Philippines was kept alive
by the agitation in this country and urged
his countrymen, North and South, with
out regard to their political party, "to put
a stop to the unscrupulous agitation that
for nearly two years has filled the hearts
of our own boys with despair and the
hearts of their enemies with confidence
and good cheer." He concluded:
O my countrymen, we are In the midst of
euch difficult responsibilities that I sometimes
feel that our resolution and our purpose are
almost overwhelmed. â¢ â¢ â¢ There are two
ideas of the national duty In this emergency.
One is that the nation should take care of It
self, and let the world alone. That is a nar
row view of our national duty. -The other ideal
of national life, an Ideal born In the heart of
the workman of Nazareth, is that no nation
liveth to Itself alone, but that every real na
tional life pours Itself out In the service of
mankind. I don't believe that the "American
republic, wlih a motive like that and a pur
pose like that, will be allowed by Providence
to fall amid the difficulties of this hour.
You have read the mastemlece â¢ of fiction
where a hand from the sky touches the shoulder
of Napoleon the Great, puts an end to his
career, and nays to him: "Tour business is
over, your time is up; your affairs are at an
end." That was the gleam of a superb Imagi
nation. There is In this world the steady light
of a faith more superb even than that, a faith
in the future of humanity, a faith in the great
ness of the republic, a faith in Providence, who
has guided every footstep of our national Iff e
from Infancy until this hour.
Let us have faith in God and faith In ' the
American republic and In our future mission.
I believe In the United States' of America. I
Hack the old republic of 'our â¢ fathers against
the world. Nor. do I think that since the good
days of Abraham Lincoln 1 there has been upon
the helm of our affairs a steadier,' wiser, kinder,
braver hand than the- hand of William Me-

SENATOR DEPEW
ON THE BEAUTY
Corrects the Idea That "Con
1 sent of the Governed" Is
Necessary.
Admits That the Filioinos Were Used
to Help Conquer Spain and
Hints That They Were
. - "Bunkoed." -~r~ r
WASHINGTON, Feb. â¢ 27.â Depew of
New .York, addressed the Senate to-day
on the Philippine question. His "speech
was beautiful in thought and diction. He
strongly upheld the'policy of the admin
istration - and In conclusion pictured so
brilliantly commerce and civilization
moving hand Jn hand for the happiness
and for 'the uplifting of the people of the
â¢Philippines, as well as thoseof this coun
try, that the galleries were swept by a
storm of applause.
No one denied, said Depew,' that the na
tives of- the Philippine Islands had been
used to help conquer the -Spanish, but he
denied that any treaty.: had been made
with them. Said he: ?; .; -. . ..
Only thrf President of -the United States
could bind the country and he only with the
subsequent .assent of the Senate. Only when
war is progressing can the coininander-in-chlet
of the army: or the: admiral, of- the navy make
a committal which' the President would be
bound in any. form to, consider or respect.-. Ad
miral Dewey alone had that power, and he
moat emphatically denies any committal what
ever .to Acuinaldo, for the Independence of 4Â»ls
so-called government. President Schurmann
also emphatically denies any committal on the
subject on the part of the Philippine Commls
â¢slon.-The various general's- of; the army made
no committals on â¢ their ,part. â¢ All the consuls
concerned, positively denied having made any
such suggestions.' -; \ : . vi vv '' . .' :
'--ScofEs "at a' Tradition. , . (S'\~
- Regarding the- plea that., the, "consent
of the governed", is necessary, he said:
The, government which was organized for the
Territory .of " Louisiana toad every, element
which has been denounced as despotism in .the
Philippines. .Â¦ Â¦ '
It has been repeatedly said here' that govern
ment by the United States in these Islands will
be a despotism. Such a belief shows a singular
ignorance. or misapprehension of the constitu
tional limitations upon our powers and the
spirit of our Institutions. While .the consti
tution does not extend over the territories of
Its own force and without legislation. Its pro
hibitions are binding on Congress. In- those
prohibitions, which are also privileges enjoyed
by the people- wherever our. Jurisdiction 1 ex
tends, is a complete charter 'of rights, which
Congress. can neither limit nor impair. All per
sonal privileges, and immunities, such as reli
gious freedom,', property rights, freedom of
speech and freedom of the preus and equality
before the law,; must* prevail wherever our flag
floats. .But outside of the constitution and laws
is an unwritten law,- created by the genius of
the .institutions of the paramount power, and
controlling its acts and officials in all colonial

Hawaii's' Contract Labor.
Consideration of the Hawaii govern
ment bill was then resumed. The contract
labor question was precipitated again by
Pettigrew, who offered an amendemnt
providing that all- contracts for labor en
tered into- since August 12, IS9B, should be
declared null and void. In 'a speech sup
porting the 'amendment Pettigrew assert
ed that since the annexation of Hawaii
thirty - thousand contract laborers had
been imported. to Hawaii; their contracts
extending' over -periods of .from three to
ten years.' , ' "
In . response . to questions as to whether
Asiat'lv contract laborers displaced local
laborers, Pettigrew replied that to - some
extent they did. .He went on to say that
the coffee lands, of which we have heard
so much, practically, had been changed
Into sugar plantations, the lands as such
being Immensely productive. These sugar
plantations were controlled by vast sugar
interests, which during the past year had
been paid by this Government in remitted
duties - $12,000,000. These great interests
would control the. Legislature of Hawaii
and, consequently,:,' he -wanted such an
amendment to the bill as; would meet

Mrs. Mitchell Phillips and Mrs. E. O.
Smith, who were at the head of the com

the ball. The proceeds of the ball will
go to erect a building to house the magni

Mrs: M. P. O'Connor. The returns of to-

STORM OF CONFETTI
ON PARIS STREETS
PARIS, Feb.. 27.â A drenching rain and
a leaden sky this afternoon threatened to
make the fate of Mardl Gras a complete
failure, : so' far as Paris Is concerned.
Nevertheless a pood number of people
gathered along the boulevards, where con
fetti tables were allowed, and, splashing
through mud and rain, exchanged volleys
of these fatal missiles. As evening ap
proached, â¢ however, the rain ceased.
Crowds flocked to the Avenue dcs Champs
Elysees and the boulevards, where all the
stores, were closed, and soon the tradi
tional gayety of the Parisian asserted it
self and King Carnival reigned supreme.
From one end of Paris to the other the air
dally in front of the cafes, from which, col
was filled .with clouds of confetti, espe
ored serpentines were thrown in return.
A living sea of merrymakers'thronged the
principal thoroughfares, and the sido
walks and , roadways were 'Inches deep

ers' Room (the main hall), of
the edifice. On every side last
night one could hear expres
sions of admiration for the scenes of
splendor in decorative effect. Carnival
colors, red and yellow, dominated in
the Jesters' Room. Below the arched
skylight draperies which formerly ob
scured the painted figures frescoed
designs had beenr remove 3, and the
effect was a triumph in the higher range
of adornment. A vast chandelier or
group of Chinese lanterns was pen
dant. One immense lantern, made, by
special order, gave but a great volume"
of softened light. Hundreds of incan
descent lights, clear, frosted and col
ored, afforded . illumination without
producing a glaring effect. The guest
at the ball received first impressions by
the view of the Jesters' Room, and the
impression was one that is bound Â¦to
linger in memory, as a thing of beauty
is a joy forever.
The affair last night was the fourth
ball in the Mark Hopkins . Institute,
hence the ' experience in decorative
schemes acquired at former functions
afforded practical knowledge of decora
tive effect as applied to the main hall,
but the application did not extend to
the new Art Gallery, as this annex was
only finished a few days ago. Four
balls should impart practical knowl
edge. Many a youth has gained valu

was all well enough for the French in

the interior of the mansion on
California street "hill, known
as the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art.
presented last night a scene of enchant
ing splendor. The house, Hluminated
from turret to foundation-stone, in
honor of the seventh Mardi Gras ball
of the Art Association, was admired by
many throngs of outside spectators.
The bal masquÂ« of the Art Associa
tion is recognized in San Francisco as
the annual society/event, although fate
and the board of directors of the asso
ciation'occasionally decree that the an
nual event shall not take place an
nually. This paradox v must be -ex
plained by the genius of art, which pass
eth human understanding. In great
families renowned for intellectual pres
tige genius frequently skips a gener
ation, hence the Art Association may
skip a ball in purely natural sequence.
The ball, therefore, annual, biennial
or triennial, always engages the atten
tion of society. Dowagers, maidens
and those of the fair sex in intermediate
grades of loveliness and beauty, are
fond of dismissing the prospective
charms and pleasure of the event. The
success of the function is not always as
sured by the simple announcement that
the Art Association has resolved to lend
its fame and protection to the ball. The
inflexible dowager, rejoicing in the title
of art patroness, often has a mind of her
sweet and inspiring music, the . pleas
ures of imagination, and they -almost
participated in a riot to get supper. But
all the time the Queen of Propriety,
jeweled and grand, in her. private box,
kept her eyes on" the court of Louis
XIV. Books which society maidens of
high degree are not permitted to
peruse ; leave it an open question
whether this particular court which
;Peck .-. and Fletcher and Greenway
elected to reproduce was all that a
highly respectable and prudent court
should be.
The court knew itself, last night and
behaved . itself and was happy in the
favor of society.
Â¦The president and directors of the
Art Association began to feel the first
thrills of official happiness last Satur
day, when the number of tickets taken
by the representatives of San Fran
cisco's best society surpassed all pre
vious records. Every succeeding day
added to the joy of the board. Yester
day Mr. Green way waved his wand and
commanded -supper for one hundred
more guests than- the first order con
templated.
Captain Robert Howe Fletcher..cu
rator of the Mark Hopkins Institute,'
devoted special efforts , to* decorative
and illuminative" features of the" Mardi
Gras event. Reward "for his toil was
given when the guests saw the beautiful
decorations of ' the -Throne j Room (the
new art gallery), 'and the massing of

the revels. Greater would be the joy if
a street parade, a real outdoor carnival
of fun and riotous mischief,^should be
decreed. In the name of Art every
thing goes in Paris. Why not go to the
limit in San Francisco?. The directors
listened respectfully to the plaint of the
Artist. /; r
The directors had to render the de
cision. This year they decided that
merriment within the bounds of pro
priety could not reign if gentler Â»en were
permitted to mask, and hence came the
decree against wearing of masks by
men! The artists were disappointed.
They had a grievance, and the grief
<jrew as the hours glided by. It is one
of- the wonderful, unfathomable mys
ceries of Art that an artist without a
grievance cannot be supremely happy.
The directors, above all other con
siderations, desired that society should
oestow its sweetest approbation on the
iunction. The oracles of society were
consulted, and all the concessions de
manded by the Queen of Propriety were
readily granted, hence the presence of so
many of the Queen's beautiful and
lovely daughters. And they had fun â
the delights of the dance, the solace of

HEALTH BOARD DELAYS
SWINGING OF THE AX
Will Meet Mayor and Supervisors'
Finance Committee To-Day â Ap
propriation May Be Raised.
The Board of Health met last night with
the Intention of abolishing all Its depart
ments except the Harbor and Emergency
hospitals and dismissing all Its employes
except about s^ven, as already enumer
ated: but action was postponed until the
meeting to be held to-night. Dr. William
son announced that the Mayor and the
Finance Committee would meet the board
some time to-day for the purpose of
straightening out. if possible, the diffi
culties that now confront the board.
Dr. Williamson stated that he did not
care to prognosticate what the action of
the committee would be, but lt Is believed
that the members of the Board of Super
visors, with the possible exception of
Reed, have begun to realize the danger to
the health Interests of the city by a prac
tical abolition of the department and that
the Finance Committee Is prepared to rec
ommend an addition to the J25.000 already
appropriated. Whether that sum will be
s-foOO In order to place the appropriation
at the old fissure of $35,000, has not yet
been determined, but lt Is quite certain
that an Increase will be recommended.
The following committees were appoint
ed to carry out the provisions of Â¦ the

Disturbed Sleep Is an Indica-
tion That Your Nerves
Are Weak.
WEAKENED NERVES LEAD TO
VERY SERIOUS AFFLICTIONS. :
Sleeplessness Is an evil fraught with great
danger, for lt prolonged it may overthrow tit.
reason, or produce apoplexy. The most- fre-
quent cause Is weakened nerves.
.There are many conditions that result ia a
weakening or injury to the nervous system,
and that accounts for the frequency of this
baneful affliction. Men and women in all
walks of life are liable to nervous decline.
Sleeplessness is one of the early symptoms oC
nervous prostration, it Is a warning that seri-
ous disease Is Impending. We cannot do with-
out refreshing sleepâ it Is most necessary to
life. Wh*n one does not get the requisite
amount of sleep the vital energies fail to re-
cuperate,, the forces are gradually expended,
the bodily strength decreases. Extreme ner-
vousness and headaches result, the memory
becomes clouded and many other symptoms en-
sue.
The dur st way to overcome Rleeptessnesa and
the many other symptoms dv. to weakened
nerves Is to strengthen the nervous system.
HUDTAN. the greatest nerve and tissue build-
er of to-day. Is a positive cure. Narcotics and
sedatives should be avoidedâ they will result
in harm. HUDTAN reaches the source of th*
evil, it builds up the weakened nerves, it pro-
duces nature's sleep, the sleep that brings
health and vigor.
HUDTAN makes rich, red blood. It over-
comes weakness and debility. HUDTAN brings
ail the organs of the body into harmonious
action. HUDTAN produces brain quietude.
HUDTAN Is for sale by druggistsâ soo a
package or six packages for $2 50.

faulting three. In direct application to
the Mardl Gras event the managers ascer
tained that a greater d<V ree ot I! Sht vvas
rÂ«-<juire<S than had been afforded in pre
vious plans of illumination. A hint was
given to the corps of electricians and
many additional lights, arc and incandes
cent, were supplied.
The problem with which Captain
Fletcher and Mr. Martin had to wrestle
at length related to the adornment of the
new art 'gallery, or what was known last
night as the Throne Room. It was easy
enough to determine that shields, banners,
standards and other royal and heraldic
dfvlces, together with palm branches and
ribbons, should be displayed along the
walls, whereon the skylights, cornice
lights and great arc lights would shine.
It waa necessary to give volume of light
without a. glare to offend the guesU In the
boxes.
Tlie servlc* of art studentsâ pupils In
the School of Designâ was brought into
requisition to censtruct, adjust anil dec
orate with appropriate devices the her
aldic shields. The raw material consisted
of sheets of tin and quantities of paint
It is highly creditable to the students that
a splendid triumph of decoration was
achieved in eucfa a ehort time.
The scheme of adornment, however,
was not In perfect harmony with the
court pomp and splendor as suggested In
the grand march. The banners and de
vices of royalty were of a type too email
for the Court Room and the occasion. The
Impression of grandeur was not sug
gested.
The Court of Beauty, adjoining the
Throne Room, where the royal ladles ex
changed mercy JeÂ»is, was adorned in yel
low.
GORGEOUS AND
STATELY OPENED
GRAND MARCH
BEFORE 9 o'clock the Invited began to
assemble and soon the Indications of
a gentle, go^d-natured crush were ob
served. On California street outside the
recently ; painted pearl gray mansion, a
iense crowd cf curious spectators blocked
the way to the-entrance of the canopy.
The aid of polic* officer* was r<Hjulred to
keep the avenue of ontrance open. The
D-utsSde spectators were jtood natured and
observing. They were gaihered together
to get a glimpse of fashionable society on
the" way to Mardl Gras revels ar>d were
'julck to catch the spirit of the caraiÂ»->U.
Before the orchestra began the concert
nlrs preceding the grand march the space
la the Court" of Jestersâ the main hall of
the mansionâ was well filled with masked
ladies. Many of the- costumes were rich
and remarkably attractive. There was
no repression of the carnival spirit. Youth
danced and played merry pranks before
the dancing music began.
Veterans of the Art Association, the
past presidentsâ Colonel Alexander G.
llaw^s and Frederick W. Zeileâacknowl
edged that the carnival was eclipsing all
former functions of the like, surpassing
its predecessors r.ot simply in numbers at
tending, but In the gorgeous apparel of
the masked and unmasked.
There were bo many swell dinners In
Ean Francisco last night that society, or
many of its representatives, did not ar
rive until nearly 10 o'clock. Meanwhile
Ed Greenway. President Joseph D. Grant,
Captain Robert Howe Fletcher and W.
G. Stafford were marshaling their merry
and eager followers. Presently Orrln
Peck, prince of the carnival, escorted by
his court, descended from an upper cham
ber of the royal palace and proceeded to
the library- Â¦
A trumpet signal for the formation of
the procession was greeted with applause
as many maidens and gallant gentlemen
were ever so anxious to speed the hour*
to the music of the waltz. The column
moved without delay, the trumpeter in
advance of the herald. Then came
Prince Carnival. two pages of
the Grand Opera-house company
bearing his train. Noble courtiers
ga> Jesters and distinguished ladies of
the court followed to th<> superb Wagner
ian music from the Grand March in
â¢"Tannhausrr." The merry but orderly
trmy of fun-lovers inarched and counter
marched through the jesters' room and
Court of lioamy to the new gallery or
throneroom. When the procession Was
in motion, displaying tho gorgeous habili
ments of the court nnd subjects, universal
admiration was enlisted. The pages
were beautiful, like- wise the herald and
xne advance herala.
When all were as*wÂ»mbledl in the new
pallery and the Prince had ascended the
throne the herald signaled for silence
praying the audience to listen to some
word? from Uie gracious Prince of the
Oarnlval. Instead of silence there was
npnlause. which soon subsided as the
l*rlnce began his address to the courtiers
the Jesters and the multitude. Embar
rassment reigned briefly at court, for the
Prince forgot the pp^ech which the Prime
Minister had prepared for him. He
stumbled over several sentences, to the
amusement of his subjects, and then be
gan., to read his typewritten copy. The
speech is reproduced in full elsewhere.
At the close of. the speech from the
throne of Mardl Gras merriment there
was a goodly clapping of hands. The

SOCIETY RESENTS
GROSS INSULT TO
ITS FESTIVAL
AN afternoon newspaper Impressed
the disagreeable fact of Its existence
upon the public yesterday by offerlnij
a gratuitous and particularly offensive In
sult to everjMnan and woman who at
tended the ball. ~ln announcing the great
pleasure gathering of the Art Association
this sheet published an Indecent picture
of a woman, garbed in tights and an ex
cuso for draperies, and made the brutal
R!OT OP BEAUTY TN THE SUOW OF A THOUSAND LAMPS
TJÂ±"iS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1900.
and utterly unjustified announcement that
many women would be similarly un
clothed at the festivities of the evening.
The offense Is immeasurably aggravated
by the fact that the annual masquerade
of the association is and has been abso
lutely above reproach. Its success has en
listed the energies of the best men and
women of San Francisco. Its festivities
have been marked by scenes that could
give no suggestion of impropriety to the
most evil minded. Its revelers and merry
makers have been men who value tneir
names and cherish the honor of their
women. Its supporters and well-wishers
have been those who have by right of
conduct' and honest lives a claim to re
spect and decent consideration. It is re
grettable to the last degree, therefore, that
the pruriency of an irresponsible sheet
should have the license to spread its in
decency before the public.
COURTIERS WHO
RUFFLED IT IN

The army and navy officers Joined me
civil throng last night In paying tribute to
the genius of art. The glitter of golden
braid and the luster of brass buttons
added to the grandeur of the scene.
When it came to dancing and Jesting with
the fair sex the army was not shy and
neither was the navy timid.
MIDNIGHT SAW
THE SCENE AND
SOFTLY SMILED
AT MIDNIGHT all the old-time ball
goers, as well as the youthful pa
trons (jf the dance, testified that the
seventh, Mardi Gras -was the success of
the season. As early as U 'o'clock. . the
managers began to persuade, the. bankers,
merchants and professional men of middle
and advanced age that It was time they
were going to supper. The plain Inference
was that youth was eager for larger danc
ing space in the Jester's room and art gal
lery.
When the masks were thrown aside at
midnight there were the usual surprises
of the bal masque.
Caterer Wheeler managed his depart
ment of the functions with. ability and
served the array of Prince Carnival in
good style.
Fortune seemed to smile on the carni
val from the time of the grand march on
to the "sma' hours." - The" Â¦ thousand
lights, under the careful supervision of
electricians, did not fail. The number of
tickets sold, from which the association
receives $5 for each "one, was 760. This
showing gratified the president and the
directors.
As the night wore on the music became
more animated. The supper, too, had an
enlivening effect. There was a promise of
fun, something touching the innocent riot
of the carnival season.

CHANGES OF
BENEFIT TO
THE ARMY
Secretary Root's Appeal on
Behalf of the Military
Bill.
TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE
Lessons Taught by the War With
Spain Used to Good Advantage
in the Framing of the
Measure.
WASHINGTON. Feb. Z7. â Secretary
Root to-day appeared berore the House
Committee on Military Affairs and made
a strong appeal to the committee to re
port favorably the bill drafted by him. to
Increase the efficiency oÂ£ the army. The
Secretary said In part:
The bill is limited to three subjects. (1) Pro
motion in the line: <Z) tenure of etaS appoint
ments and the relations between the staff and
the line; (3) reorganization of the artillery.
It Is carefully framed to avoid raising the
QUeeticn ef the sixe cf tbe army, which, it is
understood. Congress Is not now ready to dis
cuss, and its provisions are made applicable
to any army of whatever slie Congress may
determine upon.
Tbe provision as to line promotion is that
every third promotion to the office of major,
lieutenant colonel and oolcnel shall be by se
lection, leaving the other two-thirds to be as
at present, by seniority. This Is designed to
afford some alight optxjrtunity for recognition
of exceptional ability and gallantry. Under
the present law, which permits promotion
only by seniority, the President is prohibited
from reaognlring meritorious or gallant con
duct: tbe most effective and brilliant service
must go unrewarded, the thoughtful, devoted
and ambitious young man Is precluded from
advancing himself by his own exertion a hair's
breadth beyond the indolent, the dull and the
Inefficient man who iÂ« Just able to perform
duty to keep from being turned out of the
service.
Guarding Against Favoritism.
The only objections to the proposed measur.
arÂ» that there may be favoritism in the selec
tions. The impartiality of the selection Is safe
guarded by the provision of the bill that the
promotion shall be made from a list of three
officers selected from the grade from which
the promotion is to be made by a board of
officers of superior rank convened for that
purpose and sworn to make the selection ac
cording to the merits and fitness of the com
mandant a* ehown by hie service records.
From these three the President is to make
the nomination, which has again to pat's the
ordeal of confirmation by the Senate. The of
ficers of the army have its efficiency and honor
and Justice to Their fallows more deeply at
heart than any one else in the world, and this
bill puts Into their hands tbe power and im
poses upon them the solemn duty of confining
these promotions strictly within the lines of
Justice.
The sections relating to staff organizations
provide for the abolition of the present sys
tem of permanent staff appointments and for
the substitution of details from the line or the
staff for periods of four years, unless sooner
terminated by the President, with the require
ment that upon the expiration of a detail the
officer shall serve at least one year in the line
before he Is eligible for another detail. The
advantages of these provisions. I believe, will
be manifold. I think the change will break up
and prevent the tendency to bureaucratic gov
ernment, of which there Is always danger, and
will increase the efficiency of both the line and
the staff, by breaking down the division be
tween them, by giving to each a more intimate
and personal knowledge and appreciation of
the difficulties and the needs of the other, and
by creating a larger body of all-around men

Efficiency of Bureau Chiefs.
The provision which permits thÂ« President to
terminate a detail to the staff is of tbe high
est importance. Nothing could be more un
practical than the present permanent tenure
cf the chief of a bureau. The President, as
Commander-in-chief, ia responsible for the ef
ficiency of the army. In time of war he 1Â«
expected by the country to produce results by
Its use. He can determine who shall command
the armies and can change generals in com
mand as often as he chooses, but he is abso
lutely powerless as to the heads of these great
departments which organize and assemble and
feed and clothe and transport and arm and
equip and care for the army. Victory, or, de
feat is organized in the staff departments be
fore a shot Is fired. Inefficiency in them means
necessary disaster at the beginning and the
expenditure of countless treasure and the sac
rifice of countless lives. Yet no matter how
plainly inadequate to the task the head of one
of these departments may be. the President it
powerless to make a change unless the officer
commits itome distinct and heinous offense
upon which he can be court-martialed and dis
missed from the service. |
The Secretary said care had been taken
to protect the rights of incumbents of
staff positions, and he understood the
great majority of them were' satisfied to
accept the change cheerfully. Their op
position, he said, was purely personal and
of the same kind which for years had un
dermined every attempt at improving
army organizations. Such considerations
should not prevail.
He then explained the provisions of the
bill in detail, dwelling especially on those
relating to the artillery. An increase of
6500 men. almost all In the coast artillery,
had been provided for, but the increase
would be spread over five years, and in
order to avoid raising any question as to
the size of our army at this time, the
1300 increase each year would be made up
by recruiting that many fewer in other
arms of the service. The regimental or
ganization Â¦ was abandoned as to the ar
tillery, and the battery' or company
adopted as the unit of organization, sub
stantially all military authorities being
agreed that there was only a multiplica
tion # of red tape, and no sense, in trying
to administer the artillery arm on a regi
mental basis when only one battery as a
rule was In one locality. A chief of ar
tillery was provided in order that this,
like other important branches, should
have a responsible head.
Some Opposition Develops.
Members of the committee asked many
questions and showed, great Interest in
the Secretary's statement. The provision
giving the adjutant general of the army
the rank of major general developed some
opposition, and Marsh of Illinois moved
to strike it out, but the motion did not
prevail. Section 2, which is Intended to
appply to General Shafter. again brought
out a motion by Jett of Illinois to strike
out, which also failed. The bill as. a
whole was then agreed to by a divided
vote. The first section abolishes post
chaplains, and authorizes the President to
appoint a chaplain for each regiment, reg
ular and volunteers. The other section is
as follows:
That the President Is hereby authorized to
eelet-t from the retired list of the army an of
ncer not above the rank of brigadier general,
who m&v have distinguished himself during
the war with Spain, in command of a separate
army, and to appoint, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate, the officer co se
lected to be major general United States army,
Â¦with the pay and allowance established by law
for officers of that grade on the retired list.
That en and after the pat-pap? of this act
the adjutant ceneral of the United Stales army
fhall have the rank, pay and allowanced of a
major general.

the cause in all cases of indigestion is the
same: that Is, the stomach for some rea-
son fails to properly and promptly digest
what is eaten.
This is the whole story of stomach trou-
bles In a nutshell. The stomach must have
I rest and assistance and Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets give it both by supplying
those natural digestives which every weak
stomach lacks, owing to the failure of the
peptic glands in the stomach to secrete
sufficient acid and pepsin to thoroughly
digest and assimilate the food eaten.
One grain of the active principle in
Etuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat, egrgs or other whole- ;
some food, and this claim has been proven
by actual experiment which any one can
perform for himself In the following man-
ner: Cut a hard boiled egg Into very
small pieces, as It would be if masticated,
place the egg and two or three of the
tablets In a bottle or Jar containing warm
Â¦water heated to 98 degrees (the tempera-
ture of the body) and keep it at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours, at
tbe end of which time tbe egg will be as
completely digested as it would have been
In tbÂ« healthy stomach of a hungry boy.
The point of this experiment is that
what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do
to the egg in the bottle it will do to the
egg or meat in the stomach, and nothing
else will rest and invigorate the stomach
so safely and effectually. Even a little
child can take Stuart's Tablets with safety
and benefit if its digestion Is weak and
the thousands of cures accomplished by
their regular dally use are easily ex-
plained when It is understood that they
are composed of vegetable essences, asep-
tic pepsin, diastase and Golden Seal,
which mingle with the food and digest it
thoroughly, giving the overworked stom-
ach a chance to recuperate.
Dieting never cures dyspepsia, neither
do pills and cathartic medicines, which -
simply irritate and inflame the Intestines. '
When enough food is eaten and prompt-
ly digested there will be no constipation,
nor in fact will there be disease of any
kind, because good digestion means good
health In every organ.
The merit and success of Stuart's ' Dy-
spepsia Tablets are world wide and they
are sold at the moderate price of 50 cts.
for full-sized package in every drugstore
In the United States and Canada, as well
as in Europe.

HORRIFYING
SCENES AT A
TRAIN WRECK
Women Burned to Death
in Full View of '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Feb. 27.â The bliz
zard prevailing throughout Western Mis
souri was the cirect cause of a train
wreck to-night on the main line of the
Missouri Pacific Railroad, In which at
least two persons and possibly more were
killed and several others were badly hurt.
The fast St. Louis day express, due to
arrive in Kansas City at 5:45 this evening,
was delayed by a freight train which
stuck in a snow drift two miles south of
Independence, Mo., about twelve' miles out
of Kansas City. The St. Louis local pas
senger train, running forty minutes beiiind
the fast express, came on through the
blinding snowstorm and crashed into the
express train ahead, the engineer having
failed in the driving snow to see the dan
ger signal which the first train had sent
back.
Such was the force of the collision that
the parlor car, which was In the rear of
the first train, was literally cut In two.
When Engineer" Frank Raymond and his
fireman escaped from the wreck they
crawled out through the windows of the
parlor car. Fire added to the horrors of
the wreck, coals from the furnace of the
shattered engine having fallen among the
debris of the splintered coach, and soon
the whole wreck was ablaze. Two or more
persons, it 1b believed, were burned. A ;let
of the dead and seriously injured, so far
as known, ie as follows:
Dead:
MRS. J. G. SCHMIDLAPP, Cincinnati;
instantly killed; body recovered.
UNKNOWN WOMAN; body consumed
in wreck.
Injured: J. G. Schmidlapp, Cincinnati,
will recover. Miss Schmidlapp, Cincinnati,
scalded; will lose sight of both eyes.
Mrs. J. Balke, Cincinnati; mother of
Mrs. Schmidlapp, badly scalded, eyesight
lost, but may recover. W. R. Vaughn,
Cincinnati; newspaper reporter; scalded
and right arm crushed; amputation neces
sary. L*. F. Sheldon, Sedalia; assistant
superintendent of Missouri Pacific, pain
fully scalded. Braketnan Frank McAfee,
St. Louis; badly bruised. Mrs. Elizabeth
Peters, Kansas City; scalded. Mrs. Eliza
beth Lee, Cincinnati; scalded.
All of the injured have been brought to
the University Hospital in Kansas City.
William Rost. a farmer, near whose
place thÂ« wreck occurred, and who was
one of the first to render any assistance
to the Imperiled passengers, is quite- sure
that at least three women were burned in
the wreck. When he reached the car
flames were crackling through the splint
ered woodwork of the car at one end,
while at the other a cloud of blistering
steam was belching from the locomo
tive, which had ripped the coach open
from end to end. On every side were
men and women crying for assistance.
Mr. Rost's first act was to pull from the
wreck a woman whose legs were sticking
out through a broken window. She was
not badly hurt. By the time this had
been accomplished other passengers from
the forward coaches had come back and
helped out all of those in the burning car
who could be reached.
Mr. Rost states that he saw the body
of one woman jammed in the roof of the
burning coach, and that it was not
reached by the rescuers. The body of an
other woman was consumed in full view
of the passenger* who gathered about the
wreck.
Mr. Rost and others tried to drag her
out, but she was pinioned under heavy
wreckage. Mr. Rost says the young wo
man was apparently dead, as he reached
her hand and there was no response to
his efforts at rescue. He describes the
woman as about 25 years of age. She
wore a dark dress and a leather chate
laine hung from her waist.
Mr. Rost believes that he saw the body
of still a third woman wedged between
timbers of theÂ» burning coach, but before
he could get closer the fire and smoke and
steam obscured his view.

Love Tragedy Back of the
Suicide of Bessie Evans Â¦
at Madera.
BUSINESS MAN DENOUNCED
Citizens in Mass-Meeting Adopt Res
olutions Branding Louis Kutner
as a Moral Coward and So
cial Outcast.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MADERA, Feb. 27.â Bessie* Evans, a
popular young waitress employed. at the
Yosemite Hotel, swallowed an ounce of
carbolic acid last Tuesday morning and
ran Into the room of Louis Kutner, a
prominent business man, where she died
a few minutes later. At first the fact of
her having died in the young man's room
was regarded as a mere accident, but
upon closer investigation evidence was
discovered which appeared to argue more
than that.
Two notes were found, both of which
had been written by the girl and ad
dressed to Kutner., In the first she said
that she loved him and that if it were not
for him she would not kill herself. The
second note was written on the back of a
postal card and was a trite quotation to
the effect that "chastity is the most
priceless g^ft that God has given to wo
man, and it should be returned to Him
unsullied." This note was signed with
the girl's initials, "B. E."
The Coroner's jury investigated the
case and examined several witnesses. It
read the notes written by the girl and ad
dressed to Kutner. The inquest resulted
in a verdict of suicide, the jury failing to
fix any responsibility.
When the notes were read at the in
quest and other evidence brought out. the
facts created a sensation. A number of
the society women of the town, headed by
Mrs. Dr. Butin, held a meeting at which
it was decided to issue a call for a mass
meeting of citizens to take place at the
Presbyterian Church last night. Fully
200 of Madera's citizens were in attend
ance and the discussion was of the most
animated description. The facts in the
case were reviewed and young Kutner
was denounced. A set of resolutions was
finally adopted without dissent, in which
the young business man was declared to
be morally responsible for the death of
the girl. Some of the most radical por
tions are as follows:
Kutner Denounced.
"Whereas. An innocent youne girl of excellent
reputation (by name Bessie Evans) having been
betrayed by flattering promises and the hope
of a future happy home into an unholy alliance
with a moral coward, not to say libertine <by
name Louis Kutner), who by his relationship
with her and the conditions Into which he
wantonly hurled her has by these misdeeds
caused her to seek and find a suicide's jrrave
unavenged. Therefore be It
Resolved. That we, the citizens of Madera, in
mass meeting assembled, in the name of moral
purity, home and Justice, do hereby call upon
all to â¢whom these presents may come to use
every moral influence to erase from our midst
the name of Louis Kutner, whem we brand as
a social outcast.
ReÂ«olved. That we view with consternation
the attitude of the Madera Times In this case.
in which It makes an effort to gloss over this
crime and by innuendo to blacken the reputa
tion of the dead girl. We believe that where
a newsDaoer tries to condone such a crtme as
this it Is not worthy of the, respect or support
of the public.
The next resolution asks the Board of
Supervisors , of. -Madera- County to with
draw all the county patronage from the
Times. The paper Is a -weekly and is
edited by J. E. Nugrent. It suppressed the
sensational features of the suicide in its
account of the affair, and defended Kut
ner. Ine Mercury, another weekly, takes
the side of the people as represented in
the mass meeting.
The suicide and its consequences have
worked up the people of Madera to a
state of high excitement. Kutner has
left town and it Is said that he is in San
Francisco.

HER MAJESTY'S FLAG.
CECIL RHODES, saved from the Boers by the
relief of Kimberley at. the expense of great
treasure and the life of many, a British -soldier,
has taken occasion, at a meeting of the De Beers
Company to speak out of the fullness of his heart and
exult in the victory. Coming from >such a, man , at
such a time,- the speech, was certain to" be, widely;re
ported, and Rhodes must" have known when he ut
tered it that he was speaking to the world. His has
been the master mind that for years past has directed
British expansion in South Africa, and now in his
speech there arc revealed to us the thoughts of that
mind and the ideals to which it is devoted.
There is nothing in the speech of true grandeur of
any kind, not even the grandeur of imperialism. The
chief point of exultation of Rhodes is that the year's
profits of the De Beers Company amount to 2,000,000
pounds sterling, and that the company owns 'all the
diamonds wherever its charter exists. After dwelling
with pride upon the wealth of the company in money
and" in' jewels, he spoke of the strenuous defense J of
Kimberley by, its citizens and said: "We have-done
our duty in preserving and protecting the greatest
commercial association in the worldâ her Majesty's
flag."" : "^
Had an enemy said that of the banner of Great
Britain it would have been everywhere regarded as an
unfair slur upSn a standard that upon many; a' hard
fought field has been the beacon of some of the
noblest of national ideals. What shall we think, then,
of such a declaration made, not by a foreign satirist,
but by one of the foremost Englishmen of his time?
In the mind of Cecil Rhodes her Majesty's flag is
but the symbol of: a commercial organization.. .It
stands for nothing but trade and such conquest ; as
trade demands for its profits. It is not to advance
civilization, nor to take up the white man's' burden
of educating the barbarian, but solely to promote the
interests of merchants and manufacturers, and es
pecially of the De Beers Company, that sq many
brave British youths and gallant gentlemen have gone
to their death in South Africa. To such a degree of
abasement under the rule of Chamberlain and Rhodes
has come her Majesty's flag,* and her nobles â¢ and
her peasants are .made to do the service of stock
jobbers and gold speculators as they follow to death
what was of old proudly proclaimed:
"The â¢ flag that braved a thousand years
The battle and the breeze.". 1
An ex-convict who has served the State in stripes
for bribing juries resented his ejection the other day
from a local courtroom. He insisted that his word
is as good as that of anybody else. While he is cer
tainly entitled to his opinion there is an; emphatic
objection to his exercise of his judgment in -our

PINHEAD MANAGEMENT.
THE patrons of the Sunset Telephone and Tele
graph Company in Berkeley,' Alameda" and
Oakland are just now being subjected to loss,
inconvenience and. vexation as the result of pin
head management of the affairs of that corporation.
It undertook to provide telephone facilities for a
population of about 100,000. It put up lines, using
private buildings, ornamental trees and other things
not belonging to "h to i string (and stretch its wires.
It then* provided a numbered system for the 'phones,
with certain prefixes, as "blue," "red," "black,"
"main," and so: on, for identification of the lines.
After this system has been long in operation, people
have become accustomed to it, and it has the con
venience that comes from .permanence, and habit, and
after hundreds of business men have. their cards and
stationery printed .with their telephone number and
its identifying prefix, "suddenly, and without notice,
the whole prefix system: is radically changed, substi
tuting prefixes that have no meaning, are difficult .to
remember and have'no element of fitness Â» or con
venience. As a result thousands of dollars' worth of
"cards and stationery,' business and private, are made
useless, wasted and lost, and the use of telephones is
made complex, vexatious and annoying.
A corporation which enjoys a' monopoly, exacts a
high rent for- the use^of its convenience, and under
takes to. supply one ;thafo has become a necessity oi
individual and commercial -life, can justify its
monopoly only by intelligent 'management and a
policy that is at one with the interests of its patrons.
All these principles are violated by the pinhead man
agement of the Sunset. Knowing in advance the ter
ritory it had to cover, the. radiation of its principal
lines, their length and all other facts concerning the
system, it would have required only some brains and
some respect for the rights of the public to have,
inspped out its system of designations, and arranged
its prefixes, once for all, so that no change would
have been needed. Then when its patrons were ac
customed to the arrangement all might have enjoyed
the use of the telephones, with no more than the un
avoidable inconvenience of waiting for the disengage
ment of a line, or the avoidable vexation caused by
the exhaustion of the overworked and underpaid girls
in the central office.
The corporation has chosen to add the avoidable
to the unavoidable exasperation incident to the use
of its wires and instruments, and on top of this has
piled a very large loss involved in obsoleting the pre
fixes on the printed stationery of its customers. Thi3
means also a current loss of business. Patrons who
order by telephone are for a time led astray, cannot
find the store they want to reach by wire, and ..in im
patience and haste get to any one they can reach; 7:
This burden, added to nearly similar erratic. changes
in the running of street cars in Oakland "and Ala
meda, adds an inconvenience to life and business on
that side of the bay which is seriously reflected in
harm to large interests, to progress, to access of popu
lation, and to all those things which make for the
prosperity of a community.
As we have said, it'is done without notice. Had
the corporation been mindful of anything but the col
lection of its own rents and nickels it would have
given a notice of intended change long enough iii' ad
vance to have permitted the use of business and pri
vate stationery already "printed, so that there would
have been no loss. This would have somewhat
softened the idiocy of the management in its conse
quences to the victims. ..But there is no such disposi
tion nor forethought shown, Â¦ and monopoly presents
itself in the most swinish form; regardless of the harm
dene and the inconvenience inflicted. .â¢ -..

COMMERCIAL MUSEUM PLANS.
I |ROM the report submitted to the promotion
I committee of the commercial museum by the
â¢ subcommittee on plan of organization good rea
sons may be drawn for sanguine hopes of the success
of the project. The plan suggested for the govern
ment of the museum, when established, is excellent,
and the programme of action outlined for immediate
work promises good results.
According to the suggestions of the report the in
stitution is to be known as. the Pacific Commercial
Museum; its objects arc to gather and to give to its
members information that will assist in developing
commerce with foreign countries, and particularly all
countries in and around the Pacific Ocean; also to
establish a connection with the Philadelphia Com
mercial Museum, and other like institutions, by which
information may be obtained from the rest of the.
world which would be of advantage to the pro
ducers, manufacturers and merchants who may, be
members of the institution.
For immediate work it is recommended there shall
as soon as possible be appointed a finance committee
of sixty prominent citizens, to which all the members
of the promotion committee shall be added. It is \he
duty of this committee to make a thorough 'canvas's of
the States of the Pacific Coast, and receive donations
and subscriptions from all steamship companies, rail
roads, banks and other corporations, as well as from
capitalists, merchants, manufacturers, real estate"own
ers and all 'others interested in the development of
our commerce. The committee is furthermore to
canvass for members of the museum and to collect
from each subscriber his initiation fee.
There will be of course differences of opinion as
to the details of the plan of administration, but those
are minor matters and can be left for adjustment
hereafter. The, main object now is to get the mu
seum established. It is not a small undertaking, ai:d
a good deal of money will. have to-be forthcoming.,
Fortunately the importance of. the issue is well un
derstood by the progressive men of the coast, and an
elaborate preliminary campaign of education ,\vill
hardly be necessary. The enterprise appeals to the
personal interests as well as to the public spirit of
the merchants, manufacturers and producers of the
country', and it is reasonable to expect them to give it
a prompt and earnest support.

BLOW AGAINST
BROTHERHOOD
ASSOCIATIONS
New Southern Pacific Relief
Department Opposed. by -
Employes.
They Claim That It Is an Indirect
Means to Weaken Their Well-
Established Protective
Societies.
Over at the Oakland mole, where the
trainmen and the engineers congregate,
there may be seen at any hour of the day
groups of Southern Pacittc employes gath
ered around a big white chart hung con
spicuously in the boxroom. It is the new
prospectus of the Southern Pacific relief
department, and trainmen, brakemen, en
gineers, conductors and mechanics are up
in arms against the new ...order of the
company." They claim that It is a direct
blow at their brotherhood associations and
allows them no cnance but to take out
policies in the new venture, of the com
panyâthe insurance business.
The relief department plan provides for
sick benertts as well as insurance money.
This Is where the shoe pmenes painfully,
for the members of the brothernoods re
ceive sick benefits from their own organi
zations. In fact, one of the reasons for
the existence of the brotherhoods is the
sicK beneht assurance. At present all or
the majority oi the men employed by the
{southern .facinc on me trains or. in the
yarus belong to one or other of the broth
ernood associations. They claim tnat they
cannot ' stand the doubie expense that
would result if they were members of
botn organizations and that the company.
Knowing this, has inaugurated a relief de
partment to weaken and ultimately 0.6
jstroy tne brotherhoods. In many in
stances," it Is said, the pressure ot dues
would be too great to bear, but the train
men are wary of orienumg the company,
fearing displacement If they fall to come
m witn the tresh tide ol members who
will soon join the relief department.
"Where will our brothernoods be?" is
the cry among the railroad laborers.
After a lengthy introduction, which re
cites the charitable inclination and atti
tude of the company toward its employes,
the- framers of the circular reach tne
business . part of the programme. . The
way the Southern I'aculc Company pre
sents its gilded package is to disclaim
any. lntent to force employes into me re
lict department. Membership on the part
of all employes in the service of the com
pany prior to March 1,-1900, will be volun
tary and without regard to physical con
dition or age, but tney must enter tne
class required by their, salary. A limited
time in which to become members under
the above conditions is allowed, and this
limit is fixed at one year. After the ex
piration of that time any employe who
wishes to join the department must sub
mit to a physical examination and must
not be over 45 years of age. All persons
who enter the service of the company
after March 1 are required to become
members of the relief department.
According to, the scheme, classes are
formed based on the salary of the em
ploye. The charges for membership, the
sick benefits paid and the insurance In
case of death, depend for their amount on
this classification.- But there are several
reasons why the employes of the company
are hotly antagonistic to the foisting of
this new relief scheme upon them. Be
cause of the section which forces all new
employes to join the department and the
other, .which allow* but a year in which
to take out a membership, the servants of
the railroad .corporation believe that they
will be. forced either Into the scheme or
they must go glimmering down the road
of the unemployed. Â¦â¢ Â¦: ?\ Â¦ Â¦ Â« . â¢
Another section In the application for
membership which fills the trainmen with
alarm is a release clause. In case of death
by accident the surviving relatives receive
the insurance money, but the applicant
for membership on joining signs a release
to the company absolving it from any lia
bility for damages. Â¦
ANOTHER "HOLD-UP" EXPOSED.
\A AYOR PHELAX, in his eagerness to com
/ \ promise the newspapers which have criticized
..Â¦:*-, the misfeasance and malfeasance of his ad
ministration, asked some brash questions of J. B
Crockett, president of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company, at the hearing before the Board
of Supervisors on Monday, and thereby brought
ibont the exposure of another "hold-up" on the part
of his pet journal, the Examiner. The incident was
amusing in itself, but was made more so by the
ivriggle with which the Examiner endeavored yester
day morning to slip out of the record and leave the
rhxrcf at the door of The Call.
This is the way the examination was reported in
the yellow faker:
President Crockett was put on the stand, and he
6T7ore that ois:trs' salaries of the company amount
to $12,601 a year.
"Xow, let us come to the advertising expenses
of your company," said the Mayor. "Is it not a
fsct that you weTe stood up by a newspaper for
th' sum of $5000 for a single advertisement?"
â¢Yes." said the president, "but we paid $2500
only, for a World's Fair edition."
"Did you get value receivedP"
"We did not."
"Wnat have your ads cost you this yearP"
"Not to exceed 5500."
"How do you account for the fact that you have
not been molested.?"
"I don't know."
"Was it the Chronicle that wanted $2500 P"
"It was not."
"Was it The Call?"
"I don't know that it makes any difference in
this investigation."
"Then you decline to answtr because. I named
the right piper?"
"You have no right to assume that." â¢
The inquiry was then dropped.
The closing assertion, "The inquiry was then
dropped," contains a suggested lie. It is true tht
Mayor made no further inquiries, but it is not true
that the subject was dropped. Mr. Crockett had
something to say. After bringing out the evidence
thai a demand for $5000 was once made upon the
gas company by a newspaper of this city, the ques
tions and answers proceeded thus:
"Did the newspaper get the money?" asked the
Mayor, eagerly.
"T"_:e paper did not get it," replied Crockett,
"but it did get $2500."
"What papsr was thatP" asked the Mayor.
"Oh, I don't care to say," was the laughing re
ply cf Crockett. "I don't want to get them all
down on me."
"Was.it the ChronicleP" asked the Mayor.
: "It was not," was the reply.
"Y~as it The CallP" the Mayor asked, and be
fore Crockett could reply, added: "I see you hesi
tate. Since you stop there I assume that it was
The Call." BESS . -
"You have no right to assume anything of the
sort,*' was Crockett's angry retort. "If you con
tinu? to ask me the names of all the newspapers
you will finally get your answer. We paid that
$2500 to a newspaper which issued a World's Fair
edition."
It 'was after the statement of Mr. Crockett that the
*T.dM-up" had been committed by the paper that is
Â£i;cd "a World's Fair edition" that the inquiry was
e'rojr, cd. It was dropped from the mouth of the
Mayor at that point like a hot potato, for the Mayor
perceived when too late that he had exposed another
of the rascalities of his pet paper.
I: is the Examiner that issued the notorious
World's Fair edition, as is well known to all San Fran
cisco. It is that yellow journal which used the edition
as a means oi getting itself on the payroll of every
corporation in sight, pulling down the Southern Pa
cific to the tune of $30,000, and demanding $5000 of
the gas company. It is that journal which has ever
since been howling because the gas company paid but
half the amount demanded, and the railroad cut off
its subsidy before the full' s3o,ooo -was; paid up.
Such are the facts of the case. Is anybody sur
prised that the Mayor dropped the inquiry?
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1900,
LICENSING CRIME FOR COIN.
AN afternoon paper yesterday announced that a
., majority of the Board of Supervisors are in
â¢ favor of granting a license for a renewal of
racetrack gambling. It said: "If the opinions ex
pressed by individual- members of the Board of Su
pervisors count for anything, no member of the
sporting fraternity need pass a single sleepless night
pondering over the possibilities of the reopening ot
Ingleside. It is as certain as the rising of the sun, or
the going down of the same."
It then added that the Supervisors demand of the
gamblers the payment of a license tax amounting to
$100 a day to the city treasury, the argument being
that the sum is needed on account of the deficiency in
the municipal finances. One gentleman is quoted as
saying, **\Ve are almost compelled to do evil that good
may come of it," and it is asserted that the same view
is taken by others.
. On that showing the people of San Francisco will
have something to say concerning both the policy and
the principle of the proposed action. The gamblers
can well afford to pay $100 a day for the privilege of
running their nefarious trade at Ingleside, for their ill
gotten profits would be enormous; but what benefit
would that amount of money be to the city? Forty
days' racing at $100 a day would give a revenue of
only $4000. How far will that sum go in making up
the deficiency in the treasury? For how long a time
could the streets be lighted with that amount of
money?
If we are to license gambling for the purpose of
raising a municipal revenue, we shall have to enter
upon it in a wholesale way. Why should the Super
visors restrict their favors to Eastern gamblers, or
those at the racetracks, when more money could be
obtained by licensing those downtown? There are
many men who will pay $100 a day for permission to
run a roulette game. There are others who will pay
that amount for permit for a faro game. Licensed
poolrooms downtown would bring in many an addi
tional $100 a day. A pool-selling room for women ex
clusively would bring in another $100. If we are to
permit crime for coin, it will be a poor policy to limit
the license to the Eastern sports and deny it to the
local gamblers.
The principle of the issue is not one to be argued
about. It is vicious and villainous under every aspect. A
community which for the sake of providing itself with
a revenue deliberately licenses a trade that corrupts
men, degrades women, ruins youth, wrecks families
and directly encourages crime of every degree, from
petty theft to murder and suicide, is unfit to be eri
ti listed with self-government. If this license be
granted it will be the blackest blot that could ever dis
grace the record of the city, and bitterly and griev
ously would many a family pay for it.
In Berkeley when some of the municipal authori
ties hesitated to close saloons because they wished the
revenues which are derived from saloon licenses,
seme of the citizens promptly guaranteed the money
in order that the saloons might be closed. If San
Francisco were in such dire need of $4000 as to afford
even a shadow of excuse for licensing the iniquity of
racetrack gambling, the merchants would come forth
here, as in Berkeley, to guarantee the fund rather
than submit the city to the dishonor of such a policy.
" Finally it is to be noted that the plan is as futile as
it is wicked. If forty days' gambling be granted for
$4000, there will be as a result of that moral degrada
tion such an increase of crime that more than $4000
will have to be expended for the trial and conviction
of the guilty. We shall, in fact, bring suffering upon
the innocent, temptation to the weak, and encourage
the vicious to crime, for less than nothing. There can
be no profit in licensing gambling. The toleration of
crime for the sake of coin can end in nothing but a
curse to all.
Let the Supervisors examine the records of the
Police Courts and the Morgue, and compare those of
the days when track gambling was permitted at Inglc
side with those fince, -and see what track gambling
means. It is a subject they should study in order to
learn what it is they are asked to license.

IV. THE GOLDEN AGE OI 1 HE
BEEW POETRY.
BY. THE REV. E. E. HALE. D. D
The most careless reader -of the Bible
knows that the Psalms were the hymns of
the Hebrews. Even our English name Im
plies that. But. as our Bible* are gen
erally printed, the reader does not know
outside the book of Psalms, whether what
he reads In the English version were writ
ten as poetry Is written, with the enthu
siasm and purpose of poetry, or whether
he Is to read it as he reads the hard facts
of history. ">> .: ; ,f
The mott important contribution, per
haps, mado by the revised version to the
popular reading of the Bible Is the ar
rangement in the printed page of the po
etry, in each Testament co that to every
reader's eye it looks like poetry. Every
reader sees that it is poetryâ that it was
written by some poet whose work was so
good that it has survived the millenniums
of time. Every one knows that he is to
read it as he reads poetry. Kear the end
of the book of Deuteronomy, for instance,
the blessing of Moses, before he diedâ
printed as a poemâ reads;
Tho Lord came from Sinai. .
And rose from Seir unto them;
He ahined forth from Mount I'aran
And He came with ten thousands of holy ones.
And His right hand was a nery law unto them.
And so the ode or song of triumph goes
on with a reference to each of tne twelve
tribes. The mere form or the lines sug
gests poetry, where the old prosaic text
ÃBtd by the early English translators sug
gests the patient narrative of an annalist:
And he said, the Lord came from Sinai, and
rose up from Selr unto them; He shlned forth
from Mount Paran. and He came with ten
thousand of saints; from Ilia right hand went
a nery law unto them.
The commission which prepared our new
or revised version says of the prophets
tnat they have not extended to the pro
phetical books this arrangement In lines,
oecause the language of these books "la
rather of the nature of lofty and Impas
sioned prose, except In purely lyrical pas
rages." Lofty and Impassioned prose
comes very near to poetry. And in gen
eral the prophetical books of the Old tes
tament could be ranked as poetical. This
means everything from the Prophet Isaiah
to the end of the Old Testament.
Speaking roughly, we may say that the
first half of the Old Testament, the books
which go as far as Esther in the usual ar
rangement, are narrative or historical;
that after that point, beginning with the
book of Job, they are poetical. The book
of Job is often called a dramatic poem.
The Psalms are a collection of several
odes and hymns, from many authors In
many centuries. Then follow the Pro
verbs, which are cast in poetical form; the
book of Ecclesiastes, which, while printed
as prose in the revised version, is fre
quently marked with the characteristics
of Hebrew poetry; The' Song of Songs,
which has all the characteristics of lyrlo
poetry, and then the prophets.
In the first or historical part are many
songs or odes. Such is that which has
been cited of Moses: such Is the song of
Deborah. In the prophetic books, on the
othtr hand, we have sometimes a frag
ment of history. But, speaking rather
roughly, as I said, the first half may be
called historical and the second poetical.
Rhythm, Meter and Form.
It is impossible In a single paper like
this to go Into any detail as to the dis
tinctions between the external form of
Hebrew poetry and that to which we are
accustomed. It must be enough to say
that it does not seem to have had any
rhyme, and that the rhythm of the versos
is not to be strictly marked by the court
ing of syllables. We know too little of the
original pronunciation of the words to say
whether what we call "quantity" or what
we call "accent" was considered In the
composition.
One peculiarity Is observed In which t^e
Hebrew poets Indulged themselves Â»nurh
more frequently than those of the western
nations. It is generally spoken of a*
"parallelism." This word means the mejh
od of composition by which one line or
verse takes up the language or perhaps
the Idea of a previous verse and repeats
it, with more or less variation, in other
words. The writers of Hebrew odÂ«s or
Â£onfrs frequently used this method in
arranging verses which should be sung al
ternately by different choirs. There is a
resemblance to the strophe and the anti
strophe of and Greek choruses, but
the alternate verses in the Hebrew poema
are much shorter than those of the Greek.
Imagine one choir on one side of a tern
pie singing:
The heavens declare the glory of God.
And another on the other side respond
ing:
Ar.d the firmament showeth Hla handiwork.
Chorusâ Day unto day uttereth speech. .
Anti-chorusâ And night unto night showeth
knowledge.
Chorusâ There Is no speech nor language.
Anti-chorusâ Their voice cannot be heard.
Chorusâ Their line is gone out through all
the earth.
Anti-chorus â And their words to the end of
the world.
In America the late Dr. Hastings intro
duced in many churches a renewal of such
alternate singing. Those who study the
subject may well read his little treatises
upon It.
Another feature which occasionally op
pears in Hebrew poetry Is the reference,
literally, to the letter with which the
l>oÂ«-ms are written. For instance, the lL'tth
psalm consists of twenty-two stanza
each of eight lines. In the original the
first verse consists of lines beginning w!tn
the letter A. tho second verse of lines bo
ginning with thei letter B. and In rnoÂ«t
Bibles the Hebrew letter Is printed Â«it the
beginning of these separate subdivisions.
This sort of Ingenuity, sometimes show-
Ing Itself in acrostics, and sometimes In
other ways, appears in many of the
poems.
The Spirit.
But It is the spirit of Hebrew poetry
which has given It its value, an infinite
value to the world. --^-.jjvv.-/
And David's lyre is mightier than his throne.
There were very likely many poem 3 o*
ballads written in the Hebrew language
which have not come down to us which
were not so bathed in the divine spirit as
those which have survived. There is no
reason why lovers should not have writ
ten love songs, why soldiers should not
have written ballads, why meditative in
dividuals should not have written what
used to be called didactic poems, in Pales
tine as well as elsewhere. But for what
ever reason, the" poems which Â¦ survive
are, almost without exception, . poems
alive with the life of God. The writer
looks at the subject v/ith which he has to
deal with distinct reference to the In
finite life which controls movement, which
gives effect to cause, and Is the vigor and
strength of what he Is to fay. I once
wrote a little sketch In which, for. my
purpose, I Imagined a meeting between
Homer and David. I wanted to contrast
the poetry of the Greeks with the poetry
of> the Hebrews. I made Homer uing his
description of a snowstorm, and David, in
comparison, sing to him the 147 th psalm:
He glveth mow like wool:'
He scattersth the hoar-front like aÂ»hfes;
He'caiteth forth His le* like morsels;
Who can Â«tand before His cold?
He sendeth forth His wind and mclteth them:
He causeth His wind to blow and th*. waters
,t â-". flow. .
"Always this 'He,'" said one of the younj?
soldiers to another.
"Yes." he replied, "and it was so In the be
rlnning of the evening. *hen we were above
there."
- "There is a strange difference between the
two men. thoujrh the one plays as well as the
other, and thn Greek speaks with quite as little
foreign accent as the Jew, and their subjects
are th< ram*." â¢ , â¢
"Yes." Â»a!d the young Philistine harper; "If
the Greek should sing One of - the Hebrew's
songs you would know he had . borrowed it in
a moment."
"'.'And to If It were the other. way." â¢
"Of course," said tbelr old captain. Joining
In the- conversation. "Homer, If you call him
so, . slnrs the thing made: David sings the
maker; or, rather. Homer thinks of. the thing
made; David â¢ thinks of the maker, whatever
they sing."
VI .was going to Bay that Homer would sing
of cities and David of the life in them."
"It iÂ« not so much what they say as the way
they look at It. The Greek seeÂ« the outside â
the beauty of the thing. He paints the picture.
D^avld . sings the life of the picture."

tion of the Philistine harper Into their
reading of the poetry of the Old Testa
ment thty will tind that it is justified in
almost all the Important poems. Sooner
or later the singer or the poet comes
around to Fpeak of the Power of powers,
tftn Life cf lives or the King of kings.
And he Is writing or singing because ha
wants to do this thing. It Is not as Lord
bornerville wrote a poem upon hunting;
it 1s not aa Thomson wrote a' poem upon
the seasons; it is not as Byron wrote the
poem of Mazeppaâ In each case because
they wanted to describe certain actions or
movements of men. It Is because the
singer or the writer had in mind the living
God, and that he wanted to make those
who heard or read feel that *1n him we
life and move nod have our being."
The Psalms.
The great German poet. Herder, mor9
than a hundred years ago wrote some
very valuable essays on Hebrew poetry,
which have a great interest for persons,
who really want to read the Old Testa
ment in the spirit of those who wrote it
and with an understanding of the custom*
of the timÂ« in which it was written aal
the people for whom It was written.
This book, I will say In passing, would
be of great value for people who are con
ducting Sunday classes in church and try
ing to interest young people in the books
of the Old Testament. â¢ Â¦Â¦ â¢
Herder says again and again In the
course of these essays that whoever wants
really to get at the Mfc and movement of
the . poetical books of the Hebrews ha I
better study the book of Psalms ftrjt.
Make that the center- of the whole of the
Old Testament, he says. He says that
the historical psalma. written perhaps
long after the events referred to. are t?ie
Interpreters of the historical books. Fur

Their Authors and Aims.
Remember, then, that the book of
Psalms, as we have it, consists of five
different collections of psalms, ma-la at
different times, and probably by different
people. It is quite as in an old church you
sometimes find a hymn book which con
tains the Psalms of David as translated
by Dr. Watts, together with a collection
of hymns made by one minister, and an
other collection of hymns made by ar.
other. Of these five subdivisions the flrjt
ends with Paalm 41. the second wnh
Psalm 72. the third ends with the 89th and
the fourth with the l'>>th Psalm. But the
first two cannot be said to be the o!d<jat.
for some pieces are found among them
which belong to the period of the captiv
ity. The collection of the whole was prob
ably made as late as the second century
before Christ. Every one of these collec
tions has some psalms of David; and tt.o
paalms of David, more than those of ai-y
other writer, give the character to the
book. Names of authors given at the be
ginning of the psalms are not to be con
sidered very important. But In some in
stances which interest us most these
names may be regarded aa the names cf
the real authors. For instance, the 3Ctn
Psalm may be regarded as really by
Moses, though some eminent critics navo
tried to show that It was composed tn tho
period of the captivity.
If now the reader, trylns to acquaint
himself with the Hebrew poetry, will for
himself divide the psalms of David the
shepherd from the psalms written after
ward by David the king, he will begin to
get some idea of what has been meant
when we have spoken of the relation of a
poem to the circumstances of its composi
tion. Take such a psatm as that beauti
ful 133 d, which describes the friendship
between Hermon and Zion. The shepherd
poet Is on some eminence, probably to the
east of the Jordan, where he can see the
clouds gathering above the forests of Her
mon. and can see them pass south over
/he plain of Esdrael and see them dis
till in the rain over the rocks of Zion.
Seeing this, as David the shepherd may
have seen it. he writes the lines which
most of us remember:
It is the Jew of Hermon.
That cometh down upon the mountain of Zion;
For there the Lord commanded the blessing.
Even life for evermore.
On the other hand, after David iÂ» a king,
after he has obtained the mastery over
the tribes which Infested Israel with their
inroads, he will sing a statesman's song:
He maketh wars to ceaso unto the end of the
He breaketh the bow. and cutteth the Â»peae
In sunder;
He burneth the chariot in the fire.
And when he praises God It is not now
because He has "led us as goats over the
mountains." or "strengthened our hands
so that they break an iron bow.' but be
cause God Is a "King over all the ewlh.
It would also be a good exercise care
fully to read the life of David in th* his
torical books, where you will find more
than one instance where his poetry is in
troduced in the very place where th* ode
or the poem was composed.
But you may go further than this, sou
may read so carefully in the history on
the" one side and in the book of Psalus on
the other that you will form for your
selves the impression a* to trie Â»lac 3
where most probably a certain psa:m be
longs It has been proposed. inaee<!. that
for one of our English oratorios tht* con
nection between the history aua tno po
etry should be traced along and followed
out In the libretto for the performance.
The songs Â¦ would furnish the specially
lyric part of tho oiatori:). and the frame
work from history wou'.d give additional
interest to the poems as they were pro
duced one by one. There Is a composi
tion, not so well known as It was half a
century ago, by the composer Neukomm,
which is based, in a manner, upon this
idea, but the full working out of an ora
torio is left for some great American com
poser.

TO PREVENT TAX
OFFICE ERRORS
The publication of the story In yester
day's Call to the Â«ffect that grave errors
and omissions had occurred in the records
left by former Tax Collector Sheehart has
Impelled Auditor Wells to take steps that
will reduce tbe possibility of sucb errors
happening again.
.The Auditor yesterday sent a communi
cation to the Board of calling
attention to the fact that It has been cus
tomary for the Tax Collector upon receiv
ing money for taxes to receipt the tax
bills with a rubber stamp bearing his
name and that of the cashl*r. The Audi
tor advises that the signing by a rubber
stamp Is an Illegal act and the custom
should be discontinued by a resolution of
the board directing the Collector of Taxes
to receipt all bills In handwriting by hti
cashier or any of his deputies.

Mrs. Cockerill's Contract With Real
Estate Agents , Lasted a Little
Longer Than She Thought.
Burnham & Marsh, the real estate
agents, yesterday won a suit in Presiding
Justice Dunn's court against Josephine
Cockerill for the recovery of $171 25 fea real
estate brokers' commission. The evidence
showed that the defendant had executed
a contract on September 25, ISS3. authoriz
ing Burnham & Marsh to sell a piece of
property on Broderlck street, near Cali
fornia, for $6550 for thirty days from the
date of signing. Mrs. Cockerill also
agreed to pay 2^4 por cent commission if
Bhe sold the property hersslf. On October
23 she sent a communication to the real
estate agents reading: "As my contract
expires to-day I will withdraw It."
Judge Dunn hold* that It Is Immaterial
whether the contract was made on Sep
tember 2b. as claimed by the plaintiffs, or
on September 23, according to the defend
ant's testimony, for tho thirty days speci
fied therein would commence to run not
from the time of signing, but from the
date thereof, and the language of the
document of October 23 was evidently
used under a misapprehension as to the
day on which the contract would expire.
The evidence In the case showed that on
October 25, 1893, at about 5 o'clock in the
afternoon, the property was sold by Mrs.
Cockerill for J6"50. The contract had
seven hours of life and the defendant wan
clearly bound by Its terms.
MRS. ROBERT J. BURDETTE.
THE California Club tendered a reception yesterday afternoon to Mrs. Robert
J. Burdette. The affair took place at the headquarters of the club In the
Young Men's Christian Association, and was so well attended that many of
those who had gathered to hear what the bright little lady was going to
say were obliged, to stand in the hall' and catch what they could of the ad
dress as it floated through' the doors.
After a pleasant Introduction -by Mrs. Lovell White, the president of the club,
Mrs. Burdette said, among other things: ; ;. -^
"Club life for women at the present time is an evolution, and one that h.is
not reached its. highest type. Ten years ago it was represented by 'self culture; 1
then came culture ef sel{ through culture of neighbor; then followed,. on a Mill
higher plane, culture through Bervice. We were at one time in danger of pre
venting the saddest of all picturesâ club women whose intellects were being cul
tivated, strengthened, enriched at the expense of the heart. Life cannot lone
continue if head and heart .war against each other.
"Club life, like home life, should be the center, but not the limit of actUlly,
and though I mention club first and home last, 1 by no means so rate them in or
der of importance. My creed in all woman's work is this: That no work, club
work or other interest, should be undertaken that does not emanate from the home,
and in its very best results return to the home, and be always secondary to the
home." . ... .
The beneficent influence of the club upon home life, educational, civic and so
ciety life was touched upon and illustrated. As no club possesses all the virtue
and ability to accomplish this of itself, the benefit of acquiring new methods anu
plans and aims by association with others 'was strongly presented and clearly
set forth. The possibility of doing this through federation led to an elucidation
of the principles of federation and the benefits to the individual clubs and the
individual members.- .
Mrs. Burdctte made a very clear point that no club was to lose its distinctive
individuality in federation, but each-wouid continue to carry on its own work
in its own way as at present..
The gracious and graceful personality of the speaker added much convincing
force to her very cogent arguments. She possesses * a very earnest manner, be
tokening the deepest sincerity, and her voice, which is very winsome and mu
sical adds the highest charm to her ability as a public speaker.
To-day Mrs. Burdette, upon the invitation of Mrs. Phebe Hearst, Mrs. Benja
min Ide Wheeler and Miss Jewett. president of the Associated Women Students,
will address the young women of Berkeley. \
This evening Rev. Robert J. Uurdette, the well-known humorist, who is in the
city with hiÃ wife, will lecture in the Calvary Presbyterian Church for the bene
fit of the Christian Endeavor Society of the First Baptist Church.
The money derived from the entertainment will be devoted to building a new
edifice for the church. â¢ .. â¢ . ....
It is expected that the fame of the lecturer and the good cause for which ho
appears will draw a large crowd, not only of church-going people, but of those
whp like wit and enjoy genuine humor. ,â¢: r'r

can only be appreciated by those to whom
a roerciless fatz has brought this experi-
ence. To lie in bed, rt)inute after minute,
hour after hour, night after night, unable

floor, longing for sleep to close the ach) ng
eyes and rest the tired brain! Do you re-
alize that biliousness accounts for three-
fourths of the insomnia of to-day? Sucb
is the fact; and it is equally true that no
surer or safer remedy is Known than that
great liver invigorator, Warnsr's Safe

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The violent fluctua
tions cf prices of a limited number of stocks
on the ' exchange to-day realized the profes
sional traders' dreams of elysium. Handsome
proflts were realised within a space of ten
minutes and neetesarily heavy looses had to
be pocketed. But It all added to the excite
ment and interest of the hazard and board
room traders kept the speculation at the boll
ing point, working in and out of j the market
many tiir.es during the day. The commit
ments were made almost entirely on the bear
tide of the market, but the frequent taking
of profits by covering of shorts worked fre
quent and violent rallies, keeping the market
lor the specialties in a Ftate of feverish un
certainty with erratic fluctuations wheas end
it was Impossible to see. Third Avenue was
the center of interest as on previous days of
the week. On thÂ« sale of 2100 shares at the
opening quotations were practically lost, sim
ultaneous Miles being made all the way be
tween CS and (Z. against 71% at last night's
clone. The limits of the total stock Issue
Hremed to be no bar to the volume of the
transactions. The detailed record of the stock's
erratic course during the day would be with
out interest. At the lowest price It was 26%
points below last night's quotation, and a final
fractional rally was spasmodic and without
significance. Sugar maintained its prominent
place in the market, but reflected much doubt
and uncertainty on the present large out
ctan4inÂ£ phort interest. It was forced down
to 101% and in the late dealings rallied
strongly to IOSV with only a fractional re
action. There was much disorder and weak
re?s manifest at other points in the list of
cpeciaJtic-a. notably in the local traction group
and Tobacco. But an active demand for some
of the railroad stocks on some reports of large
earnings and covering of shorts in the special
ties brought the market to a high level and
quiet tone. During the hour after noon the
market seemed to have divorced Itself en
tirely from the demoralizing movement in
Third Avenue. But in the next hour the bears
fell upon the whole list, tooth and nail, forc
ing down Western Union an extreme 2\ and
Baltimore and Ohio 2\. Weakness spread from
t'.imc to other point* in the railroad list and
wide lo*Â»Â»s were effected among the indus
trials. The local traction group were down

causing a rally from 1 to 2 in the stocks which
had (hoÂ»-n the greatest weakness. Â¦ The final
downward plunge in Third Avenue was offset
fey the eudden rise in Sugar, leaving the tone
In the general list confused and unsettled, but

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, . Feb. 27.-In the Superior
Court this ; morning an order was made
which will at once raise'; the Issue of the
genuineness of a note for, $10,000, already
allowed by the executors of the estate of
the late G. W. Johns. The note Is drawn
in favor of one of Â¦ the executors and . his
sister. , Other heirs claim that the note, ls
a forgery. .Their petition that the powers
of the executors be suspended pending an
investigation , has been granted by Judge
Gaddis, ,. who to-day appointed John D.
Lawson special administrator. The court
also made the . further.' order, that George
;W. Gregory - and his attorney, W. H.
Grant, , be allowed Â¦ fifteen days within
POSTITM CEREAL.
THE DOCTOR SAID
years old, was struck and Instantly killed
at noon to-day by the eastbound Hay
wards local train. .... r
For miles in either direction from the
point where the aged woman was mangled
there Is a straight track with a clear and
entirely unobstructed view. The day was
clear and there was no reason why Mrs.
Lewis should not have been seen on the
tracks by the trainmen several blocks
away. She was killed at Wheeler avenue,
a much used crossing for residents of the
Fruitvale district. Mrs. Lewis had fre
quently traveled that route in calling
upon a son's family who live on Fremont
avenue, near East Fourteenth street. She
was bound thither to-day when she was
Btruck.
Mrs. Lewis had resided since last July
with her. aged husband, William A. Lewis,
at the home of Urban Lewis, a son, on
Wheeler avenue, three blocks south. of the
railroad tracks; Her comings and goings
were limited principally to visits with her
other son, Charles.
Ten minutes after she left the house to
day her body lay on the railroad embank
ment. It was hurled twenty feet, and
besides the fatal fracture of the spinal
column both shoulders, the left arm and
all of the ribs on the left side were
broken. ;Â» \<-
The train was moving very rapidly
when . It struck the woman. There was
apparently no warning signal given in
time to allow her to escape. The only
witness close to the scene of the accident
outside of the trainmen was J. E. George
of Fruitvale. who lives near the tracks.
He had no direct knowledge, having been
attracted to the tracks by the sharp whis
tling from the <mglne and the sudden
stopping of the train. He was not sure
whether Mrs. Lewis , had started - across
the tracks before the train left Fruitvale
station or after It was very close to her.
Mrs. Lewis' relatives Insist that she had
good eyesight and hearing and had always
been cautious ln crossing the tracks. ,
Mr. and Mrs. Lewis formerly resided In
Los Angeles. They had considerable
property. The children are: Mrs. A M
Bealo of The Needles, Walter S. Lewis
Urban Lewis and Charles Lewis. The
Coroner will hold an inquest probably to
morrow. .
CRASHED INTO A WINDOW
AND DIED OF FRIGHT
Peculiar Cause of an Aged Woman's
% Sudden Death at Emery
ville.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 27.
While groping about in < the darkness
last midnight for the door of her room-
Mrs. Josephine Revel crashed into a
window and the nervous shock produced
heart failure that resulted ln her death
several hours later. Â¦Â¦ â¢
Mrs. Revel resided with her son and
daughter, E. Revel and Mrs. Selvllle Del
sol, on Ninth street, between Folsom and
Powell, Emeryville. She Is a widowed
French woman, 75 years old.
About 1 o'clock this nu^nlns her eon
was suddenly arousad- by the crash of
breaking glass. Mr. Revel hurried to
his mother's room, whence the
noise emanated, ' and â¢ there -he
found her lying prostrate on the â¢ floor.
She revived sufficiently to explain that
she had left her bed and was trying to
find the door when she accidentally ran
against the window. The aged woman
was slightly cut about the forehead, but
othewise her injuries seemed trivial.
The eon helped his mother back to her
couch, but shortly afterward she ap
peared so greatly distressed that Dr.
Wood was summoned. Before the doctor
had arrived Mrs. Revel had breathed her
last.
Coroner Mehrmann and a Jury Inquired
into the death to-night and the verdict
was ln accordance with the facts.

MIRACULOUS
ESCAPE OF A
DIMINUTIVE BOY
John Souza Is Struck and
Pinned Down by Freight
Train Locomotive.
The Wheels Cut Off His Left Shoe
Sole Entirely and His
Big Left Toe Is
Gone.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, Feb. 27.
Struck down by a rapidly moving
freight locomotive, little twelve-year-old
John Souza this afternoon experienced
one of the most miraculous escapes from
death on record. '
The boy is the son of Frank Souza, an
employe at the Judson Iron Works, re
siding at 220 Allen street. He had also
been employed at the Iron works near
Kmeryvllle as a nail picker until yester
day, when he was dismissed. But, boy
like, he wandered about the works visit
ing his familiar haunts.
About 4 o'clock this afternoon he was
walking along the railroad tracks oppo
site the' iron works, apparently In deep
meditation, when suddenly he heard the
rumbling of an approaching train. Be
lieving that the train was on the tracks
nearest to him, he walked over to the op
posite tracks. Just as he placed his - loft
foot upon the rail the locomotive drawing
a heavy freight train struck him. He
fell In such a position that his left foot
was pinned under one of the front wheels
of the engine. The wheel cut off the sole
of his shoe clean, and it was supposed
that his foot had been crushed so badly
that . Its amputation was a presupposed
necessity, j. . 'Â¦Â¦-Â¦^ ,-
At the Receiving Hospital, however, it
was found that his only injury consisted
of shock and the loss of the fleshy lower
portion of his big left toe.
"I thought I was surely killed," he said
to Steward Borchert. "I heard no bell,
and am sure the engineer did not blow the
whistle. I heard the train, but thought It
was on the track I was walking by.

SALINAS. Feb. 27.â Considerable ex
citement was caused ln this city this
evening by the report that a man in Jail,
charged with horse stealing, was no other

Died Sitting in a Chair.
Edward Hengeland died suddenly about
5 o'clock yesterday morning: while Bitting:
ln a chair in the saloon at 6 Jackson
street. The deceased was employed as a
porter ln the Columbia House, 68 Jackson
street. He was a native of Norway, 62
years old.
An. autopsy performed. at the Morgue
by Surgeon Leland disclosed the fact that
cirrhosis of . the liver was the cause of
death. %
Had His Arm Amputated.
Thomas Madigan, a brakeman employed
by the Southern Pacific Company, while
coupling cars last night on the track be
tween Fourth and Fifth streets on King,
had his arm badly crushed.
He was taken to the railroad hospital,
where his injuries were found to be so
serious that it was necessary to amputate
the injured limb. He will probably re

and existing, aud the constant fear that
the Intend to reduce rates are
the causes assigned by Mr. Crockett. He
says that the stocks of the corporation
are held not by. rich men, but by com
paratively poor people and small inves
tors. This did not seem to harmonize
yer J w iU with his admission that Peter
J. Donahue owns 8000 shares. Mr. Crockett
has a very poor opinion of Supervisors
and said that their frequent election un
der changing conditions and with different
plans of action creates a great deal of
unrest and uncertainty. Attorney Thomas
B. Bishop, who is very carefully watching
the Interests of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company at this inquiry,
blinked and nodded in solemn accord to
this assertion of Mr. Crockett. A critical
observer might have noticed that Mr.
Bishop even fluttered as If he were skat

But notwithstanding this dlifrression Mr.
Crockett was progressing famously with
the Mayor, after the tussle with Miller,
when the president of the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company took a false
step and Irretrievably Injured his Honor's
feelings.
Gas Rebates to Laundrymen,
It was during an inquiry ln reference to
rebates in charges to certain customers
of the corporation. Mr. Crockett admit
ted, ln answer to a question, that the
company does allow a rebate, not exceed
ing 10 per cent of the charge, to certain
customers, "to laundrymen. for exam
ple," he said, "to large laundrymen."
And Mr. Crockett smiled. Ever since
that little affair ln the Police Commission
his Honor the Mayor shies at laundry
men, particularly large ones in large
places. "I wanted to know," he said, "for
a very Important reason. The charter
says that the city shall not pay for gas
more than the minimum price to other
customers. I would like to know Just
what price your most ravored customers
pay."
It was the Mayor's turn to smile. He
was determined that Blggy's shadow
couldn't frighten him even ln a gas In
vestigation. His question happened to be
an important one, bo important that
Crockett refused to answer it. He was
willing to be confidential, but not to that
extent. He promised, on being excused,
that he may be able to-day to show the
city a way out of the four months of
darkness.
Gas Inspector Tupper was the next wit
ness on the stand, and swore that his offi
cial tests' proved that the candle power of
the gas supplied by the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company averages only
15.94 candles Instead of 23. as the com
pany's experts insist. Mr. Tupper became
seriously tangled with himself, though,
under the cross-examination of Crockett.
The inspector did not even know the
name of the photometer he uses, inno
cently answering that the machine
doesn't possess a name. He retired ln
comparatively good order, however, un
der the guns of the Mayor.
A Body Blow at Gas Stocks.
Charles Ackerman, president of the
Equitable Gas Company, was the next
witness. He was persuasive, friendly, vol
uble and enthusiastic. With a burst of
confidential frankness and an expressed
desire to give a candid, honest opinion,
he assured the Mayor that gas stocks are
the most unsafe Investment ln San Fran
cisco. They are absolutely Insecure, he
said, and he is thoroughly convinced as a
truthful, honest man, that the stock of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany is not worth $10 a share. The shares
are utterly unprotected, subject to Super
visorial caprice and the stress of compe
tition. But Mr. Ackerman says his com
pany Is first class and in a short time will
be able to supply gas of excellent quality
for $1 a thousand cubic feet. His gas
works now have a daily capacity of 1,500,
000 feet on an investment of $250,000, exclu
sive of land purchases.
This Is due very largely, Mr. Ackerman
said, to the fact that the expenses of his
company are not nearly as large as those
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company. For example, Mr. Ackerman
gives his legal advice to his company for
nothing, while the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company pays $15,000 a year for
similar services. Mr. Bishop mildly re
buked the witness and, apologetically tell
ing him that he was mistaken, kindly re
frained from drawing any comparison be
tween the legal lights shod on the two
corporations.
The long inquiry into gas rates was
drawing to a close. The last witness was
L. V. Lowe, a very coy gentleman, placed
upon the stand by the Mayor. Mr. Lowe
admitted that he had said that he would
be called by the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company. He was asked what
it would cost to duplicate the system of
the San Francisco company and he an
swered $10,00i3,000.
"Did you not offer once," asked the
Mayor, "to duplicate. it for $3,500,000?" -
"I don't remember the amount," was
the answer, "but that was a long time ago
and for a different and Inferior process
than that used by the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company. It would take
twice the amount to duplicate my sys
tem now." Mr. Lowe was hastily excused.
Electric light Muddle.
The board then began the investigation
of electric lighting, but beyond receiving
a mass of technical and not particularly
satisfactory Information, accomplished
very little. The first witness on the sub
ject was F. G. Waterhouse of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company. He
gave the board a great deal of informa
tion in relation to the cost of manufac
turing electric light, but nothing upon
which the board could establish a rate.
A. M. Hunt, engineer and general man
ager of the Independent Electric Light
and Power Company, followed, and with
his testimony the board adjourned until
to-day, when the inquiry will be conclud
ed and the rates fixed. Mr. Hunt was
exhaustive in his explanation of the cost
of manufacturing and distributing elec
tric light. He dwelt particularly upon
the difliculty of fixing rates that will be
Just, to the manufacturer and the con
sumer. He suggested a sliding scale that
will take Into consideration the time,
maximum amount of use and distance
of supply. There may be also a practical
method of establishing a flat maximum
rate and allowing competition to do the
rest. He will submit his suggestions to
day.
There was some discussion over the
question whether or not the Supervisors
must fix a rate for electric light under
the charter. It was ended by a decision
to do so, and the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company will be expected also
to offer suggestions. The Supervisors
will meet at 10 o'clock this morning to re
sume the water inquiry. The gas and
electric lnvestlgatlop will be taken up
at 2 o'clock, and at night it Is expected
that both will be concluded.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1900.
ELECTRIC AND
GAS RATES WILL
BE FIXED TO-DAY
Supervisors Nearing the End
of Their Long, Wearisome
Investigation-
The Public Obtains a Glimpse of the
Art of Stock Financiering.
Secrets of the Electric
Field.
The Supervisors devoted many hours
yesterday to the affairs of the gaÃ and
electric light companies. The corpora
tions under investigation did not take
kindly to the Inquiry and more than one
Â¦sharp passage at arms occurred between
the questioners and the questioned. Facts
of general public interest in reference to
the various concerns were established and
to-day the Supervisors will end their In
vestigation and announce the rates that
wUI rule for the fiscal year beginning with
July. .
The Investigation opened yesterday with
Edward C Jones on the stand. Mr.
Jones has been using every endeavor to
persuade the Supervisors that the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company is
producing gas at the least possible cost
under the conditions that exist here. He
insisted yesterday that the company
should be treated leniently as ft pays
much higher wages than other concerns
in different parts of the country for the
same labor and is forced to pay
more for Its coal. This item of
coal is an extremely important
one, but the agents of the company de
clare that they are forced to pay very
high prices, higher, indeed, this year than,
last on account of the Boer war, that con
venient excuse for everything costly
from diamonds to ashes.
In great detail Mr. Jones related what
he knows of the operations of gas com
panies in other cities and in every in
stance he drew comparisons favorable to
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company. When he was asked to be
more explicit, he seemed to feel hurt and
replied that he was telling all he knew.
Then Supervisor Brandenstein suggested
that if the board did not receive more de
tailed Information it might be forced to
reduce the rate to Jl 25 a thousand cubic
feet. With that ominous suggestion
ringing In his ears Mr. Jones left the wit
ness stand for the noon recess. When
the board met again the representatives
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company were in a savage mood.
The Mayor as a Landlord.
C. O. G. Miller, secretary and treasurer
of the Pacific Gas Improvement Company,
was the first witness called after recess.
He wsjs an extremely unwilling witness,
maintained an air of personal grievance,
refused positively to oe candid and re
torted sarcastically to the Mayor when
ever an uncomfortable question was
asked. Mayor Phelan sought particularly
to learn the character and value of the
plant Mr. Miller represented and to dis
cover the relations existing between the
Pacific Gas and Improvement Company
and the San Francisco Gas and Â£lectrio
Company.
Mr. Miller would admit nothing 1 more
than that the two corporations had a
business understanding, but J. B. Crock
ett was more frank later in the day and
admitted that the understanding between
the companies was to leave one another
alone and to agree upon rates. During
tiie Inquiry made to determine the value
of the plant of the Pacific Company Miller
tald that it was assesseu for *2,C00,000.
"Then you take that sum as the basis
ct valuation?" asked the Mayor, blandly.
tills Honor has very great respect for the
assessments made by Assessor Dodge.
"I did not say so, was Miller's reply.
"I r--imj>ly mentioned the circumstance as
an incident In the~-case. It would be as
just to accept that assessment value as
the true value of our property as it would
he to accept the assessed value of the
Phelan building as the true value of that
property. The Phelan property, as you
know, is assessed for $3000 or S4OOO a foot,
while you know very well that It Is worth
very much more."
It is such cruel retorts as these which
irritate his Honor; but he continued gal
lantly with the Investigation, not deigning
to reply to the disagreeable Mr. Miller.
The Mayor turned to a discussion of the
Ftockn of the company and elicited some
valuable Information, the property being
listed at the Bond Exchange for one-half
oÂ£ what the company insists should be
the basis of its Interest-bearing income.
Miller refused to give any definite expla
nation of the fact and startling discrep
ancy, and then Mayor Phelan asked:
"The high price of gas stocks is due. Is
It not, to the earning capacity of the
stocks, and not to their intrinsic value?"
Shadows on the Phelan Stores.
Miller had been losing his patience very
rapidly. He had no purpose to be candid
and this question snapped from him a
long and sharp answer, in which he dis
played the grief of a personal affront. He
declared that the suggestion conveyed in
the Mayor's question was partly true and
partly false, just in its assertion of a
principle and unjust in its application.
With much bitterness of spirit he 6ald:
"If the Supervisors were to investigate
your Market-street property and allow
you $00 a month rent for your stores I
think the value of your property would
very seriously be affected. It is a very
large question and I don't, pretend to be
an expert regarding It." The Mayor
f-miled blandly and Mr. Miller was ex
cused, much to his evident relief.
J. B. Crockett was next placed on the
Ftand and gave an outline of what he be
lieves to be the causes for the depression
in gas stocks. Competition, threatened

"Stop Coffee and Use Postum Cereal
Coffee."
It seemed a hard matter to jjet
through breakfast without a cup of hot
coffee, so I stuck to it for several
years, although I was a srreat sufferer
from sick headaches, which sometimes
attacked me as often as three times a
week. I used to take medicine for my
head troubles, not knowing the cause of
them, and kept on drinking coffee, until
I finally came down with a serious stom-
ach trouble and had to go to the doctor.
He said I had dyspepsia in a bad form
and some other complications; that I
must stop drinking coffee and tea for a
year or more. I got hold of the Postum
Food Coffee, and since using it have
been entirely free from the headaches
and stomach trouble.
"It has evidently been a great benefit
for me, for my health has been revived
and I have grown fleshy since begin-
ning its use. My husband and daughter
also drink Postum and like it very
much. Daughter does not think she can
have a breakfast without her Postum.
I find people occasionally who have
tried Postum, but complain that it is
not ftrong enough. I find in such cases
that they are cither helter-skelter house-
keepers or have been very careless in
the preparation of the Postum Food
Coffee. It requires full fifteen minutes
of actual boiling after the bubbling be-
gins, and two heaping teaspoonfuls to
the person. This gives an elegant cup
of coffee. Any one who is troubled
with coffee drinking can well afford to
abandon it and take up the Postum
Food Coffee." Mrs. L. W. Bell. 2532
Nicollet aye.. Minneapolis, Minn. .
Some good housekeepers mix the
Postum, four heaping teaspoons to the
pint of water, in a very little water, and
place it in a tall coffee pot so it will not
boil over, then after it has begun to
boil and been stirred down they add
enough water to make up the requisite
amount of liquid. ,

SOFALA EARNS
ANOTHER PAIR
OF BRACKETS
Fleet Filly Seems Unbeatable
in the Two- Year-Old
Sorambles.
Three Choices Successful at Oakland.
Mary Kinsella Let the Talent
Fall With a Heal Dull
Thud.
Bookmaker Barney Schrelber's cheerful
running filly Sof ala celebrated her
seventh victory In the two-year-old dash
at Oakland yesterday. She met Count
Hubert,' Aphrodls and three green 'uns in
Modder, Madrina and Spindle, beating
them as if It were a pleasure instead of a
duty. Not much better than 9to 20 could
be had about the fast young miss, which
price seemed acceptable. Count Hubert
outsprinted her the first .part of It, but
could not hold out, falling short' a couple
of length at the wire, while the winner
was just beginning to catch the breeze.
Modder, a Candelmas colt, from the Jen
nings stable, heavily played for the show,
had his colors lowered for that position
by Aphrodls. .
'Louis. Ezell's fllly, Loch Katrine,
slipped Into the opening event under very
favorable conditions -and at odds of 3 to
5 won very easily. Henry landed Glenn
Ann In the place, a length before'Pongo.
"A cheap bunch started in the . third
number, with Romany closing a slight
favorite over Strongoli. Almoner, ridden
by Jenkins, led to within a few yards of
the wire, where Ruiz brought Strongoli
up, winning by a neck. Croker lost the
show to TallÃC by a head.
One of the most costly upsets experi
enced by the talent was the overthrow of
the 9 to 20 favorite Mary Kinsella by Rio
Chico in the mile and a furlong run. Billy
Magrane's mare, with Bullman up, was
looked upon as a moral and when Rio
Chico. went out and led from start to
finish it was a hard morsel to digest.
There were but four starters, with None
Such taking the show from Tewanda.
John Bullman did not greatly distin
guish himself by his ride on Mortgage in
the fifth number, a six-furlong sprint.
The mare went to the post a slight fa
vorite over Vesuvian, with the educated
coin all on the latter. After a long delay
Spencer on Vesuvian got a flying start
and without effort led out Bessie Lee a
length. Mortgage blew In from the far
rear when the performance was about
over, 'capturing third money.
In the final mile and a sixteenth run
Toribio, the favorite, made a runaway
race of It, heating Perseus two lengths
at the â¢Â¦wire -"in 1:46^. Tappan finished
third.
TRACK NOTES.
The attention of horsemen Is again
called to the fact that Harlem and Lake
side stake events close March 1. The
Saratoga Racing-Association's stakes also
close on the same date.
While being galloped on the track by a
forty-pound exercise boy yesterday morn
ing, Reolia became playful and ran away
ovt six miles with the little fellow. Â¦
McAuliffe, who had the mount on True
Blue, is an* Australian Jockey who was
seen in the saddle here when racing held
sway at the old Bay District track. It
was his first mount since returning >to
this country.

GENERAL BARNES HAS
JOINED THE BENEDICTS
Stole Away to New York With Mrs. Anna
Scott and Wedded Her.
His Bride Belongs to This City, but the Veteran
Clubman's Friends Will Hear the News
With Surprise.
POR days the genial face of General
Barnes has' been missing from his
accustomed haunts and among his
friends, and now comes the news
from the East that not only had he
pone to New York, but he traveled all
that way to be married. His bride is Mrs.
Anna M. Scott of this city.
Just why the veteran man about town
stole away to a distance of three thou
sand miles to be married and cheated a
thousand or two friends of the chance
to throw tons of rice and arrange in
numerable farewell stag dinners, is a
mystery. It may be that the sin of dif
fidence suddenly fell upon him and it may
be that he is getting unsociable as the
years accumulate, but whatever caused
It, all the reason he would give was that
he wished to be married in the city
Â¦where he was born and In the presence of
the brother he had not seen for twenty
five years..
The news cane over the wire last even
ing and it spread through the haunts of
Bohemia like a prairie fire. First there
was incredulity, then conviction and then
indignation at the first offense against
bociability the general has committed.
No one had the slightest idea what the
peneral was up to. He told* no one and
bore himself as a man proof against the
subtlest wiles of woman, but there cou!d
be no doubt of it: he had shaken his asso
t iates and had been married at a dis
tance, cheating his friends of the fairest
excuse for a Bohemian revel that has
happened In local clubdom.
Brought the Bride Along.
The general's wedding was character
istic. He went to New York and last
Monday dropped in on his brother, John
S. Barnes, at 22 East Forty-eighth
street. He told his brother he had come
all the way to be married, and to make
pure there would be no hitch in the cere
mony, he had brought the bride-to-be
along with him and he thereupon intro
duced Mrs. Scott to his astonished rela-
tive. The general explained why he
wished to be married in New York and
without more ado Rev. David H. Greer
of 342 Madison avenue was summoned
and in the presence of John S. Barnes
and his wife the general and Mrs. Scott
were married. The general said he did
not care for an elaborate ceremony nor
did he desire that the wedding be given
undue publicity, and he was very near
getting out of town and well on his way
home before the news got out at all, but
some one who knew what a rare item the
old general had cooked up got wind of the
affair and it was flashed across , to San
Francisco without delay.
After the ceremony General Barnes and
wife went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and
yesterday morning they started for San
Francisco. . They will arrive here Sun
day or Monday.
She Was an Old Friend.
The new Mrs. Barnes Is an old friend of
the general. He knew her for years, and
her quick Intelligence and congenial men

Rumors of a Compromise Between
Mrs. Craven-Fair and the Fair
Heirs Follow Close Upon
Supreme Court Decision.
THE Supreme Court decision sustain
ing the "trust clause" of the Fair
will had a marked effect yesterday
on those engaged in the Craven-Fair
litigation now pending before Judge
Troutt. Mrs. Craven-Fair and her
counsel resumed with renewed zeal the
legal battle they are waging for a share
of the big estate, while the opposition felt
its way very carefully, in evident dread
of stepping on dangerous ground. Just
when their cross-examination of Mrs.
Craven-Fair had reached the very brink
of an exciting climax Attorney Pierson,
who has been plying the questions,
stopped short and announced that he was
through with the witness.
This was after a searching inquiry into
the Sausalito ceremony and the circum
stances which had prompted Justice
Simpton to tell his story in writing to At
torney Foote and swear later that it was
the truth. Questions had been asked
showing plainly that tbe attorneys on the
side of the estate were pursuing the
theory that the whole Sausalito story was
a fabrication which was the creation of
the fertile brain of the woman who claims
to be the widow of the late Senator Fair.
There had been some questioning earlier
in the cross-examination with reference
to the pencil will, and yesterday when the
time arrived to continue that course of in
quiry the fire of questions suddenly
ceased.
Rumors of Compromise.
This unexpected action, coming as it did
on top of the Supreme Court decision on
the "trust clause," started any amount of
speculation as to the whys and where
fores. The essence of all the rumors that
floated about during the afternoon and
evening was that a compromise had been
reached, that the Fair children had ln-
Flsted that the pencil will subject be
handled with extreme care until it was
determined definitely whether it might
not be the "open sesame" to the vast
wealth left by their father.
Mrs. Craven-Fair's attorneys scoffed at
the idea of a compromise, yet they admit
ted that they considered the surprising
turn of affairs in the light of a partial
surrender of the opposition and a most
decided evidence of weakness.
Mr. Pierson and his associates assert
that the sudden halt in the cross-examlra
tlon of Mrs. Craven-Fair has no signifi
cance whatever. He had gone as far as
he desired and quit, and that Is all there
Is to it. according to his assertions.
Sympathy for Her Step-Children.
But the compromise rumors will not

from both sides that they Intend to con

during the cross-examination 'of the star
witness was, the statement made â¢some
weeks â¢ ago .by Attorney- Sylva; the' saint
from Sausalito, to the effect that Mrs.
Craven-Fair Â¦ had entered â¢ Into . an agree
ment with him in writing to pay him $30,
000 for contracting a ceremony conspiracy,
which agreement, he claimed, was indorsed
by the lady's son-in-law, Koehler.
The witness told all about the contract
to which Sylva referred and -according
to her- testimony he did not figure in it at
all. The contract Is with Louis F. Dun
and, for services performed and to be ren-'
dered Â¦in connection-' with Â¦ some _ ; matters
foreign to the Fair case ;and some: allied
with it. The amount-is $25,000, not $30,
000. It is not indorsed by Son-in-Law
Koehler and Its payment -Is - contingent
upon Mrs. Cravep-Falr's success in â¢ her
litigation against the Fair estate.
The Trips to Sausalito.
It was with Dunand that the. petitioner
made her first trip, to , Sausalito In; quest
of the evidence of the civil marriage cer
emony. 1 She had ; told Mr. Foote about,
it, but he could not go with'her, and sug-'
gested that she take : Dunand. . The latter
advised her to get the records . before she
told any one about the ' story," for he
feared if it became public the documents
would be tampered with. - . â¢ -
VDunand . knew Sylva," said. the witness,'
"and suggested that as he was .well , ac
quainted In Sausalito he would be *, the
man to lookup the details. Sylva' told
$200 which I gave him," said Mrs. Craven-
Fair;. "nor did I make arrangements with
any one else for his benefit. I did enter
into a contract to pay Louis F. Dunand
$25,000. I â¢ volunteered the contract. He
did not ask it. Mine . was the only sig
nature on It .when handed to him, and I
have never . seen it since. It was for
services Â¦- here ; and elsewhere. The pay
ment was not guaranteed by my son-in
law or. any one else. ".
Attorney McEnerney charged ."that the
story of the Dunand; contract was a fence
to hide the real Â¦ character of the transac
tion/ claiming that it could not be shown
that : Dunand had ' rendered â¢ any adequate
services for the amount stated.
-;- To this Charles . Pence said that as an
officer of the court he knew that Dunand
had r rendered services In securing testi
mony which would be produced later in
the.": case and .'Which would show on Its
face to be worth every cent his client had
agreed to pay for. lt.-i Dunand Is expected
to return from Mexico within a. week, and
it is understood that the evidence he has
secured. comes from â that direction.

BRUTALLY ASSAULTED
IN HER OWN ROOM
Etta Fitzgibbon Is Attacked by a
Strange Man and Frightfully
Beaten.
While seated In her room in a lodging:
house ' at 17 Grant avenue la3t evening,
Etta Fitzgibbon, a middle-aged woman,
was attacked by a strange man and bru
tally beaten about the head and face with
some blunt instrument. After rendering
the woman unconscious the stranger ran
from the house, followed by an eye-wit
ness to the assault. Meeting Detectives
Dlnan and Wren, he excitedly told them
that the fleeing man had murdered a
woman.
The detectives gave chase, and. brlni?
unable to overtake the man, Dlnan drew
his revolver, and pointing it at the mur
derous assailant of the woman, pulled the
trigger. The cartridge failed to explode,
and as the fellow was fast outdistancing
his pursuers, Dlnan again pulled the trig
ger, with the same result. Replacing the
revolver In his pocket. Dlnan, who at one
time was a professional sprinter, discard
ed his overcoat and started after the fleet
footed stranger, determined to overtake
him. After an exciting chase of several
blocks he finally succeeded in overhauling
his game.
The stranger, seeing he was cornered,
suddenly turned on the detective, but was
placed hors de combat by a well directed
blow on the Jaw. At the City Prison he
gave his name as Charles Brown. HÂ» ad
mitted that he had beaten the Fitzgibbon
woman, but refused to assign any reason
for the cowardly assault.
With blood streaming from half a dozen
cuts in the head, the victim of Brown's
flendishness was at once removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where she was at
tended by Dr. Morrison. After the woutids
were dressed the woman, when ques
tioned declared that she did not know
her assailant and was at a loss to explain
why he had attacked her. About a week
ago she said she had a woman lodger in
the house arrested and she is inclined to
believe that her action in the matter
miKht have actuated tt\e assault. To-day
Brown will be formally charged with an
assault with a deadly weapon.
the issues Involved in the case If it takes
all summer. Mrs. Craven-Fair heraeif
says she was never more determined than
now to prove her case In court, and that
she will never quit until victory perciios
on her banner or death puts her out of
the battle. While she says the Supreme
Court decision dcÂ»s not concern her, she
cannot conceal the fact that she fliids
much about It to crow over. She expresses
great sympathy for the predicament in
which it has placed her "step-children,"
but H is hard to understand whether she
is prompted in making the assertion liy
sincerity or sarcasm. She certainly does
give <">ut the impression that If her "step
children" would agree to be good due
would forgive them for the trouble they
have put her to, and might lend them a
helping hand !n straightening out the af
fairs of the big estate.
And all this leads back again to the
question of compromise and the pencil
will. That the latter document is destine-1
to play an important part in the Craven-
Fair game cannot be questioned. Some
attorneys have expressed the opinion that
It is barred out by the statutes of limita
tion. These legal lights may be right,
but there are lawyers Â¦who. like love, can
rind a way for anything, and if it Is con
sidered necessary to bring forth the old
document again some legal loophole will
be found through which to pull it.
Simpton in a Bad Boat.
The proceedings yesterday before Judge
Troutt were rather more interesting than
usual and the crowd of loungers that
filled the courtroom were amply repaid
for their attendance. The story of the
Sausalito ceremony and all the circum
stances surrounding it was the subject
upon which the counsel for the estate
appeared most deeply interested and to
which they directed their cross-examina
tion of Mrs. Craven-Fair. Like the pre
vious day, however, they learned a little
more than they wanted to and got their
foot in it by making an opening through
which the pair of Pences forced the
Slmpton affidavit and letter on the erc
ord. Mr. McEnerney made a strenuous
effort to prevent this, for it Is bound to
prove embarrassing to both the represen
tatives of the estate and Simpton. It
makes his sworn statement of the Sausa
lito affair a part of the court proceedings,
to controvert the effect of which he will
have to be put on the witness stand to
tell his later yarn, in which he poses as
a hero engaged in trapping conspirators.
The Pences say this would constitute per
jury, and if it takes place they are going
to tell the District Attorney about it.
Simpton, evidently would like to be lost,
but he is still on Charlie Fair's launch off
the Sausalito shore and the question is:
Can his guardian afford to lose him? He
seems to be In a bad boat, even if It is
the Lucero.

the Pences. despite the objections of At

that they were admissible, and in they

Plans of Fair Heirs.
The heirs of the Fair estate have de
cided to continue the legal warfare to
set aside the "trust clause" in. the dead
mlllllonaire's will. The first move will
be to apply to the Supreme Court for a
rehearing. If this is not granted, Charlie
Fair's contest of the will, now pending
before Judge Troutt, will be taken up and
forced to a hearing, with the intention of
setting aside the entire testament.

of the Pacific Coast
-' Enterprise.
The Â¦ Padflc Commercial Museum has
now a plan of organization, .which was
adopted at a meeting of the committee on
promotion yesterday. Practically this is
the i plan which was formulated by the
committee of ten. What- now remains to
be done is to appoint a tinance committee
of sixty prominent citizens and then to
collect the funds necessary to actually
bring the museum into existence. This
committee on finance will be selected at
the next meeting of the promoters, which
will 'be -on -Friday afternoon next.
âÂ¦ A suggestion was made to change thÂ©
name on the ground that the people gen
erally thought that the purpose in view
was to establish a show of some sort. The
committee took the view that the purpose
would be clear to all who could be count
ed upon tt> assist. In addition to the adop
tion of the plan the promoters adopted a
resolution submitted by Isaac Upham and
amended " by M. H. de Young, . that the
home >project might come in for $50,000 of
Government aid, in which all commercial
bodies on the coast were asked to request
their Congressmen and Senators to sup
port the pending bill to appropriate $200,
000 to the Philadelphia Commercial Mu
seum. ,
Several proposed amendments to the
plan were rejected.
â¢An amendment was adopted, which was
Introduced by R. P. Schwerin, to co-op
erate with the American Asiatic Associa
tion. M. H." de Young opposed an amend
ment to take from the executive governor
the power to nominate all appointees and
to substitute an -executive committee of
nine with a manager to name the ap
pointees. He claimed that this would de
stroy the efficiency of the plan. The pro
moters took his view of the case and killed
the amendment. Every member of the
committee of promoters will submit names
for members of the finance committee at
the, next meeting.
Â¦ Isaac Upham's motion that President
Wheeler should be requested to call a
general meeting upon his return from the
East for the purpose of reporting his in
terview with President McKinley was
adopted. â¢
