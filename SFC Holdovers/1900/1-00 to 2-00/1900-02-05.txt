Republican Govern oc Taylor of
Kentucky Causes the Re
, lease of Walker.
Â¦
Democratic Legislators Will Not Attend the
Session at London Unless Compelled
by the Military.
CINCINNATI, Feb. 4.â Thirty-two members of the Kentucky Legislature, 5
all Democrats, are to-night making the hotels and homes of political friends
in Cincinnati an asylum of refuge from whatever unknown and unpleasant Â¦
possibilities the capital city of thalr own State to-morrow might have la <
store for them. They report that four Senators and five Representatives have
been left in Frankfort, a number sufficient to convene the Legislature there. '
The legislative contingent lodging herÂ© expect to have the programme wired '
to them In the morning. They are no doubt acting under the orders of the J
steering committee, j In addition to the legislators there Is an unusually large
registration of citizens from Kentucky at all the hotels. . VJ
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 4.â Armed
conflict between the civil authori
ties of Franklin County and the
National Guard of the State of
Kentucky has been averted, and
\- ,.":' unless new causes should come to
the front there is small likelihood that the
political situation will again become as it
has during the last forty-eight hours.
Governor Taylor this morning ordered the
release of Alonzo Walker, for the posses
sion of whom Judge Moore hafi declared
that Sheriff Sutter would swear In a
posse and take possession of the Capitol
grounds, If such an extreme became nec
essary. While not recognizing In his ac
tion the existence of the writ of habeas
corpus which had been sworn out In be
half of Walker, Governor Taylor by re
leasing the man removed the most threat
ening sign of trouble.
The commanding officers of thÂ© troops
which guard the Capitol grounds are care
ful to say that 'the situation Is entirely a
military affair, and that they extend to
the writ of habeas corpus very little con
sideration; but, whether they regard It or
not. Walker Is free and Sheriff Sutter will
not be called upon to summon force in the
attempt to secure his release.
The appalling consequences which would
follow such an effort on the part of the
Sheriff were too much for the more con
servative members of the Democratic
party, and It was decided to-day that, no
matter what Judge Moore should say as
an individual, there would be no attempt
to take possession of the Capitol grounds
by force of arms. Even If Walker had
been held a much longer time than he
actually was held, no effort, the Demo
cratic leaders had decided, should be
made for his rescue after the writ of
habeas corpus bad failed.-
Both sides will take a rest pending the
session of the Legislature called by Gov
ernor Taylor at London No Democrats
will attend this unless they are taken
there by the military forces of the Stats,
and no attempt will be made In this direc
tion by Governor Taylor until he has af
forded them every opportunity to go to
London of their own accord. What will
be done when it has been made certain
that the Democrats will not visit London
has not been definitely determined by
Governor Taylor. It Is likely that mat
ters will on both sides be allowed to drift
until after the funeral of Governor Goe
bel.
WALKER RELEASED
BY TAYLOR'S ORDERS
He Is Informed . That He Hay Be
Court-Martialed at Any Time
for Inciting a Mutiny.
FRANKFORT. Feb. 4.â Alonzo Walker,
the stenographer -who was placed under
arrest' on the charge of inciting the sol
diers of the State Guard to mutiny while
pinning a notice of a proposed applica
tion for an injunction upon the door of
the office of Governor Taylor, was re
leased this morning.
The release was not made In response
to the writ of habeas corpus which
Sheriff gutter tfied in vain yesterday to
serve upon Governor Taylor. The latter
concluded that Walker had remained in
custody for & sufficient length of time
and told him to go home. The charge
of inciting to mutiny has not been
quashed, but Walker may not be brought
before a court-martial as was at one
time contemplated by the officers of the
State Guard.
At 10 o'clock this morning Colonel
Roger Williams entered the room in the
executive building and remarked to
Walker: ..-.
"Well, Mr. Walker, we have agreed to
an exchange of prisoners and yoy are to
be given your freedom."
"I can go, can I?" asked Walker.
"I guess so," was the reply, and the
colonel then added with a laugh. ""We
have exchanged you for one Zulu and
three Filipinos, and as we expect them
every minute I guess it will be all right
for you to have your freedom."
Mr. Walker was then allowed to go,
after notice had been served upon him
that the charge against him was still
pending and it could be pushed at any
time if the military authorities should so
decide. He told Colonel Williams that
he intended to remain in Frankfort.
Various rumors were circulated In re
gard to the reasons for the sudden re
lease of Walker, among them being a re
port that his release by order of Gov
ernor Taylor was In deference to a tele
gram from Washington advising his dis
charge. Governor Taylor was too busy
to-day to be seen In regard to the matter,
but Adjutant General Collier said that
no such reason existed for Walker's re
lease.
"The idea is absurd." said General Col
lier. "Mr. Walker's arrest was simply
a â¢ matter of military discipline. He was
not discharged, but was given his lib
erty* until arrangements could be made
for his trial by court-martial. When this
will be has not been determined as yet."
Asked if Walker's release was Influ
enced at all by a desire to forestall any
possible application in the Federal court
for a writ of habeas corpus. Adjutant
General Collier said:
"Not In the* least. A wrong Impression
apparently prevails in regard to the rea
sons for the arrest. Mr. Walker was heard
to make statements two days before his
arrest that were regarded as mutinous,
and persons overhearing Ms remarks
made affidavit to that effect. The order
for his arrest was accordingly made out
by Governor Taylor, and we were only
waiting for a favorable opportunity to
arrest him. His arresfat the time It did
occur was as unlooked. for by us as It
was by, him, and was more of an accident
than design. It Is simply nonsense to say
that he was confined because he pinned a
court notice on the Governor's door.
"It Is a trivial matter." continued Colo
nel Williams. "Since Mr. Walker's ar
.rest we have hardly given the matter a
thought, and his liberty was granted him
simply for the reason that to keep him
In confinement was not only a hardship to
him. but to us also, as we had made no
provision for prisoners. It will take some
time to get together the Judge-advocate
and members of the court-martial, and we
have no desire to inflict any needless hard
ship on Mr. Walker."
In response to a request Colonel" 'Wil
liams produced from the flics the order
for the arrest, signed by Governor Taylor
and dated February 2. It says:
"It appearing from information given to
me that Alonzo Walker has been guilty of
the offense of encouraging, advising and
inciting mutiny and desertion among
members of the regular State militia from
Kentucky."
Mr. Walker will return the notice of the
service of the injunction summons to
morrow and give his arrest as his reason
for not reporting earlier. . *

lecting a suitable spot. Though no definite
decision was reached, a spot In the vicin
ity of the Immense shaft erected In honor

the funeral cortege will be lacking.
Wednesday morning the remains will bo
brought back to Frankfort and placed In
the big ballroom of the Capitol Hotel,
where they will 11Â© in state all that day.

gendered by his death may result In a
clash. Precautions are being taken. Ir
respective of party, to prevent trouble.
The Interment will take place Thurs
day from the Capitol Hotel, but the actual
arrangements for the burial have as yet
not been decided on.
Plans for the raising of funds by pop
ular subscription for the erection of a

are rapidly taking shape. Besides this.
Democratic leaders say the Legislature
will make an appropriation for a monu
ment In his honor, following the usual
custom In Kentucky on the occasion of
the death of a Governor.
A suitable tablet, to mark, the spot
where Governor Goebel was shot, will
also be provided for.
DEMOCRATS CHOOSE
LOUISVILLE AS CAPITAL
Legislature Will Meet Each Day and
Adjourn Until Hatters Are
Settled.
LOUISVILLE. Feb. 4.â This city Is to
bÂ© the seat, temporarily at least, of the
Democratic State government. To-mor
row the Democratic members of the Leg
islature will meet here, and It Is pur
posed to make Louisville the headquarters
of the executive and legislative branches
of this State government as long as the
presence of troops keeps them from
Frankfort, or until the present conflict
of authority In the State is settled.
The details of this. plan were decided
upon at the conferences held by leading
Democratic leaders at Zelbach's Hotel
during the afternoon and evening. News
paper men were carefully excluded from
these councils, and every effort was made
to keep the deliberations - secret. The
plans to have the Democratic members of
the Legislature meet here had already
well matured. Preliminary steps^ In this
direction had been taken at the meetings
of these members held In the Capitol Ho
tel at Frankfort since the State buildings
have been surrounded by soldiers. The
Democratic legislators there adopted a
concurrent resolution for adjournment to
Louisville, and this fact was made known
early In to-day's conference. It was stated
by members of the Legislature present
that threats had been made at Frankfort
by persons connected with Governor Tay
lor's administration that members of the

ST. LOUIS. Feb. 4.â Fire broke out at
8 o'clock this morning In the five
story brick building at Broadway
and Franklin avenue, occupied by the
dry goods firm of Penny & Gentles,
and In a few minutes en^veloped the entire
Etrucutre. Sparks and brands were blown
in every direction by a strong northwest
wind, and the destruction of adjoining
property was threatened. A general
alarm vu turned In and soon every en
gine in the city was at the 6cene or on the
way there.
On the south of Penny & Gentles, the
flames communicated with the buildings
occupied by Sctaper Bros., dry goods, and
the Famous Dry Goods Store. The burn-
Ing area increased minute by minute, the
flames gaining great headway and leaping
across to the east side of Broadway. In
a short time a large empty store building
on the corner of Franklin avenue was de
stroyed, with those directly south, occo
jiie<l ty tn<Â« "Pt6ple*s "House 'Furnisnlng
Company, the Marks millinery storÂ«.
Dill's dental parlors and Deere Bros.' five
end ten cent etore. By 10 o'clock all the
trails of the Penny & Gentles and
Bchaper Bros." buildings, with the ex
ception of that on the west, had fallen.'
The wall between Schaper Bros, and the
Famous fell, but the fkunes were
quenched before doing much destruction
in tfre latter establishment.
It wae not long before the upper floors
and v.alls of the building opposite Penny
<k Gentles on Broadway began to fall.
Casualties to firemen were numerous.
When the walls of Deere Bros.' five and
ten cent store collapsed several members
of Engine Company No. 11 were in the
building. Four firemen were covered by
the debris and It was several hours before
they could be taken out.
Charles Mappes, a pipeman. had been
crushed to death and several Injured.
John Judge, foreman of No. 11. was
wedged In with the dr-bris. Across 'his
feet lay the body of Mappes. With a cool
head Judge directed the efforts of his
comrade? in their work of rescue. When
he was $r.ally removed he was taken to
the hospital in an ambulance, where sev
eral others of the injured had been re
moved.
From Broadway the flames ate their
way through to a number of three and
four story structures occupied by numer
ous fiftas fti various lines of business.
These were soon on fire from top to bot
tom and were razed. Heroic efforts to
keep the flames from the building on the.
corner of Fourth and Franklin avenues,
occupied by the German-American Bank,
v.ere successful. This and two buildings
adjoining on the south were saved.
Across on Fourth avenue and extending
through to Thinl avenue was a row of
old buildings occupied by the SchlfOer-
Coraella Seed Company, the Plant Seed
Company, Krenning's Glassware and
Crockery Company, BasFett Plumbing
Company. Mueller Block Commission
Company, Nelson Distilling Company. "Ie-
I-aln & Alcott Commission Company,
Hake & Sons' Commission Company. Ben
ton & Co., commission house. Bauer Flour
Company and William Bock's saloon.
Here the firemen were finally able to
stop the spread of the fire to the east.
but not until the interiors and stocks of
merchandise of all these buildings were
destroyed.
Before this occupants of buildings east
on Third and Second streets, fearing a
further spread of the fire, commenced to
remove their stocks, but at 3 o'clock It
became evident that thÂ« fire had been put
under control.*
At this point Third street widens out,
and this helped the firemen to keep
the flames In check. If the fire had
broken beyond bounds here the loss would
have been enormous. This Is the middle
of the commission district, where the
streets are narrow and the buildings old
and their contents of a combustible na
ture. Â» Nothing could have prevented the
fire sweeping everything to the river
In the meantime stores and buildings on
the north side of Franklin avenue, for
half a block east and west of Broadway,
caught fire from flying embers, blazes
being started at half a dozen different
points. " Good work by the firemen, how
ever, prevented much loss at this point.
Two ordinary stores and a few small
shops, partially destroyed, were the heav
iest losses.
The trolley wires along Broadway and
Franklin avenue were a source of danger,
and until they were cut by the Mayor's
orders there were numerous narrow es
capes from electrocution.
While trying to get a derailed car ont of
the way of the firemen at . Fourth and
Morgan streets the car bumped into -a
fire engine." crushing Fireman Hanmore.
He was fatally hurt. .
Â¦ For hours after the fire broke out the
scene was thronged by thousands of spec
tators, who had been drawn by the re
port that the entire city was burning.
Every policeman available was hurried to
the scene and rope barriers were erected
around the fire section, but it was all they
could do to keep the eager crowd back.
The loss on both buildings and stocks
of goods is approximately $1,500,000. Defin
ite figures are exceedingly hard to obtain.
There were six retail concerns which were
heavy losers. The balance of the loss is
divided, in varying proportions, among a
score or more shopkeepers or flfms. Only
two concerns suffered losses of over $100,
000âPenny & Gentles and Schaper Broth
ers. The buildings in which the two con
cerns were housed were owned by the
Mary K. Knox estate, and were erected
at a cost of $165,000. Penny & Gentles'
loss, which was covered entirely by in
surance. Is estimated at $135,000. Schaper
Brothers' loss it* estimated at $100,000.
Thesfe two concerns occupied about .half
the block on the west side of Broadway,
south from the corner of Franklin ave
nue, and the buildings were entirely de
stroyed. The rest of the block on the
west side of the street Is taken up by the
buildings occupied by the Famous Dry
goods store, whose loss was compara
tively slight.
On Franklin. Just back of ; Penny &
Gentles', the building occupied by the
Fuch Millinery and Cloak Company Buf
fered a loss on the stock of $40;000.
The store occupied by D. Crawford &
Co., at Broadway and Franklin avenue,
was entirely burned, with a leg's on build
ings and stock of $70,000. The People's
House Furnishing Company, at 814 North
Broadway, was completely wrecked: loss,
$50,000. At 812 North Broadway, Deere
Brothers' store, filled with a stock of
5 and 10 cent goods, sustained a $33,000
loss on buildings and stock.
The fire swept through the block from
Broadway to Fourth street and burned all
buildings' from 827 to 809 N. Fourth street.
These buildings were old three and four
story structures, come' occupied as. tene
ments above and stores " below, while
others were vacant. Here the St. Louis
Dressed Beef and Provision Company, the
Schisler-Cornell Seed Company and three
small stores suffered a loss of J65.000,
while the losses on buildings amount; to
nearly $45,000. .. '.
Among the firms and individuals that
suffered heavily from the fire are the fol
lowing, whose places of business were on
the east side of Fourth and west side, of
Third streets: A. Nasse, wholesale grocer;
Plant Seed Company; Krennlng Glass
Company, Bassett's plumbing' establish
ment. McClain & Alcorn Commission
Company, . Buelter-Block Commission
Company. Nelson Distilling Company,
Hake & Sons' Commission Company,
George A. Benton, produce: Bawer Flour
Company, Shaw & Richmond, produce.
Late to-niKht John Cummlngs, private
watchman of Penny & Gentles', was "ar
rested and is being held at the Four
Courts pending an investigation into the
origin of the fire. He was taken into
custody as the result of a statement by a
woman rooming opposite to the effect
that she had seen a man answering the
watchman's description lighting matches

Bennett.
LONDON, Feb.' s.âJust one week
ago to-day General Buller.'"in an
address to" Warren's' division, bade
-. the . men to be, of good cheer, for
he hoped to be in Ladysmith within
a week. > â¢
That the general's hopes have not yet
been realized may be taken as a cer
tainty; for there is no doubt.that.news of
the relief of Ladysmlth would not Â«be
held up.by.the.War Office. 'Has he even
yet begun an advance and crossed' the
Tugela? ,-..-;Â¦ *â¢, ,
A.host of rumors were current yester
day In regard to the' British commander's
movement In Natal, the general tenor
of the reports being, that he-was once
more - endeavoring. to force his way
through the Boer lines. One telegram
went bo far as to assert positively that
he had- crossed the Tugela. Up; 1 to an
early hour, this morning no confirmation
of these statements was forthcoming, the
War Office stating simply that.it had no
news for publication.
The Dally Telegraph's correspondent,
Mr. Bennet Burlelgh, who is with Buller's
army, .telegraphed from Spearmans Camp
at 6 o'clock last evening that, aside from
occasional sniping and the advance of a
small body of British troops to drive back
Boer sharpshooters from the' north bank
of the Tugela at Potgieters Drift, the day
was quiet. He added, - however, .that
the troops were enthusiastic '- over the
prospect of an early advance.
,On the other hand, one of the news
agency reports says that Buller, crossed
the Tugela on Friday and is marching on
Ladysmlth. It is possible that Lord
Dundonald's recent 'reconnoissance' to the
most westerly of the drifts on the Tugela
was mistaken for an advance in force.
Another agency has a . message to the
effect-that on Saturday. Ladys'mlth heard
the guns of the army of relief. Then the
Pietermaritzburg. correspondent of the
Dally Mail states definitely that General
Bufler has undoubtedly secured a road
to Ladysmlth and will reach his objective
point this week. .This last message may
be merely an echo of the general's Spear
mans Camp speech, Â¦ but the other two
telegrams are more ' definite. I :
| It is difficult to understand why, wHh
out large reinforcements. General . Buller
should' succeed;: on t this;, occasion, after
failing at' Spion Kop, unless under the
steady pressure 'which the', strengthened
British forces in other fields are beginning
to exert the Boers' have weakened their
forces before Ladysmith and. that Bulier
is aware of this. â¢Â¦' Â£'_->. ii'-'ir.
Â¦ " All ' over town one heard " nothing ' but'
talk .of a new attempt" to. relieve Lady
smlth. During the day I met' a' gentleman'
from South Africa^ who gave me "news
some ' time ago' of A what', was -going . on- at
Delagoa Bay.^When I ho-was 'â¢ aaked^Trbjj,
just one victory the war is half over."
- In the clubs, Â¦ where accurate informa
tion Is usually to be obtained, I found the
same, impression prevailing. There has
returned also a general feeling of confi
dence, just exactly the opposite, to what
Is represented in certain foreign news
papers, which describe the British nation
as nervous and the military position as
hopeless.' ' ' ."Â¦ \
To-day r war overshadows everything.

BULLER MAY SOON
REACH LADYSMITH
LONDON, Feb. s.â The Pietermaritzburg
correspondent of the Daily Mall, tele
graphing yesterday, says:
"General Buller has undoubtedly se
cured the road to Ladysmlth and should
reach his 'objective point this week. It
Is believed here that the object of the
Boers in occupying Ngiitu, Zululand, is to
secure the road from Dundee to Vryheid

the Boers had been enormous. 7-'/. ; ;'-i/
"Considering their limited forces, they

which they conceal with the utmost care
from the relatives of the dead. There are
thousands . of letters at . the Boer head
quarters which are undelivered because
those to whom they are addressed are no
more.
"I think that Buller Is all right. The
only thing' to do with the Boers is to keep
banging away at them. A few more such
victories as the Boers have had of late
and they will be finished with. The Boers
can replace nothing, of what they lose,
whereas the English can fill up every gpp
which occurs. That's why I say Buller ia
right, even if he has to retire again, to
attack and keep harassing the Boers,
who are in a bad plight, suffering men

President Kruger to Europe by way of
Delegoa Bay to appeal personally to the

ENTHUSIASTIC PRO-BOER
MEETING IN DENVER
DENVER, Feb. 4.â Twenty-five hundred
persons packed the Broadway Theater to-:
night to express sympathy for the Boers
in their war with Great Britain. At least
that many more were turned away on ac
count of the limited Fpace within the the
ater. S. J. DÂ«nleavy. the recognized lead
er of the Irish in Colorado, presided. Gov
ernor Thomas, Thomas M. Patterson,
Mayor H. V. Johnson, Father W. O'Ryan
and others delivered strong addresses
sympathetic for the Boer republic. Gov
ernor Thomas declared Great Britain de
served the condemnation of the nations
of the world.
The resolutions declared for moral and
financial sympathy for the Boers and
against an An^lo-American alliance.
Copies were ordered sent to President Mc-
Kinley and the Colorado delegation in
Cogress. Congressmen Shafroth and Bell
sent telegrams of strong sympathy with
the object of the meeting.
BALTIMORE. Feb. 4.-Xearly 2000 per
sons attended an enthusiastic pro-Boer
mass-meeting in Ford's Opera-house to
night. The principal speakers were Con
gressmen Sulzer of New York, Rhea of
Kentucky. Lentz of Ohio and De Armond
of Missouri and Senator Allen of Nebras
ka. Several hundred dollars were raised
for the Boer relief fund. Congressman
Sulzer of New York was permanent chair
man of the meeting. â¢ Almost the first ut
terance of the New Yorker set the audi
ence on fire, and several times during the
course of his remarks he was Interrupted
for five minutes at a time with the shouts
and huzzahs of the audience. Said he:
I hopÂ« that this bloody and unjust conflict
will end in the marauding British being driven
from the Transvaal and the ultimate institu
tion of the United States of South Africa. This
Is a war as unholy as any war ever waxed.
It is a crying word and a crimÂ« In the- face
ot the civilized world. We want this country
to Â»how her colors. We want the pro-English
policy at the White House to come down.
Senator William V. Allen of Nebraska
said he believed the common people of
England are against the war. Said he:
It Is the official England that is proseeutinr
and persecuting the hapless â¢ Uo*rs. If the po
litical party to which I belong- Vere In power
It would not be forty-eight hours until the
news would be flashed across the ocean that
the hand of the butcher must be staved In
Souti Africa.
Congressman Rhea of ' Kentucky re
ferred sarcastically to the so-called Eng-
Hsh-speaklnK alliance, and declared that,
notwithstanding. England dared to stop
our merchant marine on the high seas.
He continued: Â» . â¢

threaten to shoot him.
"The Boera say Great Britain made a
mistake In not sending General Sir Evelyn
Wood. I understand that they still have
thousands of barrels of food supplies
etored In reserve at Delagoa Bay."
Winston Churchill, In a dispatch from
Epearmans Camp, dated Saturday. Febru
ary 3, sayr:
"The belief is general that all will be
staked on the issue of the coming battle.
It is probable that no press telegrams will
be permitted to leave pending the opera
tions. The fiphting power, morale and
material of the army was never higher
than It is now."
The Daily Telegraph has the following
dlf-patch from Spcarmans Camp, dated
feanday evening:
"Messages are now freely exchanged
between the camps of General Buller and
General Whiteâ by night with calcium
light, by day with heliograph. The men
are enthusiastic at the prospect of a
f-peedy advance under General Buller's in
structions. A very large convoy with
stores for the besieged garrison will ac
company the relieving force. The Boers
have repaired the road bridge over the
TuÃela at Colenso sufficiently for the
jiaesage of cavalry."
PROBABLE DIRECTION
OF BULLER'S ADVANCE
IX)XDON. Feb. 6.â A special dispatch
from Durban, dated Sunday, and referr
ing to General Culler's recrosfing the Tu
eela In an advance upon Ladysmith, says:
"It is probable that General Buller
crossed at a *pot above Trlchards Drift,
and that, leaving the enemy to the right,
he Is marching to Acton Homes, whence
the road to Ladycmith runs almost due
rast, through a fairly open country.
"It Is expected here that he will reach
Ladysmith to-morrow (Monday) night."
Spencer Wilkinson, In the Morning Post
to-<iay, predicts that the war will end
rightly in epite of all bungling. He Â»ays:
"When Lord Roberts is ready for the
advance a new complexion will be put on
the campaign. There will be a strategical
Idea, and as this idea gradually reveals
Itself, what seemed an inextricable' tangle
of dlfflcultle* will In time present itself
as a comparatively simple problem."
The correspondent of the Times at Lou
renzo M&rquez. telegraphing on Saturday,
again comments upon - "the facility with
which foreign mercenaries get through."
This, In his opinion, euggeets the exist
ence of "an effective local organization
enjoying the co-operation of the Portu
guese oSclals."
He says: "In face of the experiences of
the last few days It is hopeless to expect
lha exercise of any but the most per
functory control of the rush toward the
Transvaal:"
The Capetown correspondent of the

water up the sloj.ff. the littie ran re of purple
breasts is alive with Boers. Then we must
have been mistaken about the peacefulness of
thlg place. Peace where all those Boers are?
There has been no tÂ»eace In Africa since the
Boers came here; no peace for the British Blnce

We are to lunch with the ruards. Welcomed,

'j he boom is the noise of a big run; the soof
fonf is the shell tearlnr through the air. The
oipnâ precisely like a couchâ is the bursting
of the shell.
"That's our Joey." says the colonel. "Let
us see where the shell strikes. By Jove! a
pretty shot, plumb where they have their forty,
pounder."
Boom', from the Boer run on the right.
T'irh! from thÂ»ir shell, which sent us a fountain '
of spray of sand near the ganpers' hut.
"Didn't burst," says a captain.
'"D^vilifh Ftrangr. though." Â«ayÂ« another.
And we are all out of the tent. BendlnÂ«c for

The Standard's correspendent at Lady
emlth devotes the greater part of a two
column letter to the subject of spies. He
writes:
That there are traitors and spies, white as
well as black, in the garrison of Ladysmlth, is
evidently certain. The enemy never falls to re
ceive notice of our movements. General Jou
bert,. indeed, is said to have been anery be

HEAVY CASUALTIES AMONG MAJORS.
In the battle at Ladysmith January 6 fourteen commissioned officers,
including Colonel Dick Cunyngham and the Earl of Ava, were killed and
twenty-seven woundedâ a total of forty-one. Of this number the rank of
major furnished eightâ three killed and five woundedâ a remarkably heavy
proportion.

"I do not believe the sun in heaven ever
shone on a more just war than that of
tne United States against Spain. But
could it be said that the sun ever shone
on a more unjust war than the one be
tween ureat Britain and the Transvaal."
TOOK WAR TALK IN
A SERIOUS LIGHT
LONDON, Feb. s.â While Londoners are
not at all alarmed or worried over the
outcome, of the war some members of the
foreign colony are quite. uneasy.
An amusing Incident occured at the
Carleton Hotel the other day. The
leaderof theHungarlan band requested of
the manager of the hotel that he and hiÂ»
men be released from their contract so
that they could return home. Upon being
urged to give his reasons he said mysteri
ously: "We have been told there is going

BOER HEAD LAAGER, LADYSMITH.
Feb. 2.â With the exception of desultory
shots from "Long Tom" everything Is

GENERAL AVERELL'S
CAREER IS CLOSED
Death Summons the Famous Cav
alry Leader and Inventor of
ASpnalL raving*
NEW TORK, Feb. 4.â Major General
William Woods Averell, the last of the
great cavalry leaders of the Union army,
died at Bath, N. V., yesterday, aged 68
years. He ,jvas one of the inventors of
asphalt paving, and in 1893, after seven
teen years of litigation, was awarded
$700,000 by the appellate division of the Su
preme Court as his share of the profits of
the Barber Asphalt Paving Company.
The name of this famous cavalry leader
is not as familiar In these days and in this
part of the country as It was during the
closing years of the war and the decade
following throughout the greater part of
Virginia and West Virginia, where his
dashing operations made it even better
known than those of Sheridan and Cus
ter and Crook.
General" Avrell was born at Cameron,
N. V., in 1832, and graduated ffom West
Point in 1535. As a lieutenant of mounted
riflemen, he saw much frontier service
against the Indians, until October, 1858,
when he was severely wounded. When
th*Â» civil war broke out he was on in
definite sick leave, as a result â¢of his
wound, but returned to duty and rendeerd
important services in those early days of
the great conflict. He participated in the
battle of Bull Run. as acting adjutant
general to General Fitz John Porter, and
fcoon after was made colonel of the Third
Pennsylvania Cavalry and put in com
mand of a brigade before the defenses of
Washington. In the spring of 1862Â« he led
the advance on Richmond, taking active
part in the Peninsular campaign, and the
seven days' rights, and afterward. In the
Rappahannock campaign at Kelly's Ford,
and commanded one of the two divisions
of cavalry with which Stoneman made his
famous raid to the rear of Lee'Â» army.
In 1563 he was given command Â¦of the
Fourth Separate Cavalry brigade, which
command was later Increased by three
brigades of cavalry and one of infantry,
with which he rendered most effective
service in clearing the Confederates out
of West Virginia. In the winter of 1863
64. he made his great strike in his raid
to Southwest Virginia, and cutting the
railroad to Tennessee by which Long
street, then near Knoxvllle, was getting
his supplies. The following summer he
commanded one of the divisions of cav
alry In Hunter's raid up the valley of
Virginia, toward Lynchburg, and by hi.s
activity and knowledge of the country
was largely instrumental in saving the
expedition from complete disaster and
capture.
In the fall of that year he fought the
battles of Moorefleld, Winchester and
Bunker Hill, with great credit to his abil
ity as a commander. Later he joined
Sheridan near Winchester, and partici
pated In all the campaigns that followed
under that commander, including the bat
tles of the Opequon, Fisher's Hill and
Mount Jackson. For his conduct of the
action at Moorefield he was brevetted
major general. He resigned from the
army in March. ISCS, and was appointed
United States Consul General at Montreal.
Canada, in 18C6. In ISSS, by act of Con
press, he was restored tae his grade of
captain in the regular army and placed
on the retired list.
POPULISTS INCLINED

National Committee Meeting at Lincoln
Likely to Be Dominated by
Middle-of-jtie-Rqadsters.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Feb. 4.-fNebraska Populists who favor fusion are an
ticipating trouble in the selection ooff f nominees for the Presidential ticket. J. '
H. Edminston of this city has been assured that at leaat 150 members of the .
Populist National Committee will attend the meeting to be held here Febru
ary 19. and while ft is generally believed that the Western delegates will/fa
vor the holding of the national convention at the same time and place with
the Democrats, there is no doubt that the combined strength of the midrlle
of-the-roadsters will amount to a great deal when it comes to deciding upon
a location. < Â¦. Â¦ . .
It is not at all certain that the fusionists who favor nominating" Bryan
and demanding in exchange the Vice Presidency will be In the majority.
If they are, the convention will prob ably be located with that of the Demo
crats, but if the. middle-of-the-roadster s predominate the convention will be
held a month or more earlier. : ' Â¦
The scheme proposed for defeating the. opponents of fusion is to , have
United States Senator W. V. Allen nominated, with the. National. Committee
holding the power to fill. any vacancy that might occur on the ticket, so
that upon. the withdrawal of Mr. Allen the name of Mr. Bryan might be
substituted. ; It is ; also, asserted that by pursuing this plan there Would bÂ©

BULLER FIGHTING NORTH
OF THE TUGELA RIVER
Mournful Monday (the name given by common
consent to the day of Nicolsor.s Nek), when
the Boera gave disastrous proof of acquaintance
with our plans by withdrawing their main body
from tbe center of our attack and by prepar
ing an ambush for the Gloucesters and Irish
F*uslleers. The reconnolssance under Colonel
Brocklehurst also showed that they had been
warned in time to change their position. In
short, it Is impossible to avoid the reflection
that we are in an enemy's country. The loy
alty of the British colonists Is b-Â» ond sus
picion, but the Dutch element in Xutal is very
strong. Several farmers have been caught red
handed and many civilians and volunteers have
brothers and cousins fighting on the other side.
Every project Is known and discussed in the
volunteer lines long before the regulars have
any idea of It, and of course have ; received
countermands of orders that have reached
them.
Our horses and oxen have Buffered, the sup
ply of fodder being exhausted and the limited
area of grazing grounds having been cropped
to the last blade. Groceries have run out; pure
water is scarce: whisky sells at 3fi cents a
drink, and milch cows are coromandered
for beef, but more oppressive than all the hard
ships wÂ» endure la the dreadful monotony of
the siege. We have ceased to take any Interest

exercise U restricted. and a gallop on
horseback is possible only under shrapnel or
common shell. There might appear to be one
resource left, and that is to sleep the time'
peacefully away. Even this consolation Is de
nied, for Ladysmith is afflicted with a plague
of flies more terrible than any which op
pressed the Egyptians. They descend upon us
in cloudsâ noisy, voracious, stinging pens, at
tacking every exposed part of the body with
ceaseless energy, boldness and unflinching de
termination. Every dish on the table is black
with these torments, so that it Is often liter

date of December 13:
It is Imx>oes!t>le to express the : feeling of

Day dawned, and with the advent of the sun
the big bud on Bulwayo opened a spiteful fire.

with the effect that there were three casual

MACRUM REFUSES
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
! NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â Charles E. Ma
crum, former United States Consul at
Pretoria, arrived here to-day on the
American liner St. Paul. With him were
his wife and little- daughter. Mr.
Macrum's silence is still unbroken, though
he says that to-morrow, after his arrrlval
in Washington, he will issue a statement
over his signature, telling why he left
his post at such a critical time. -
Mr. Macrum was very reticent to talk
about even, the situation in Africa when
he left.
"There is nothing more I care to say
at present," he said v "I have been asked
time and time again as to my reasons for
leaving South Africa, and I must answer
now, as I have done in the past, that I do
not care to say anything. I shall go to
Washington as soon as possibleâ to-day If
I can make connections â and report to
the State Department. Then I will make
a statement, and not before then. I know
that many things have been said about
my leaving, but I have nothing to say at
present." . . . Â¦
Mr. Macrum refused to either confirm
or deny the story that while In Paris he
held a conferenoe with Dr. Leyds. Presi
dent Krugvr's diplomatic repte3entativo
in ' Europe.
It was pointed out to the former Con
sul that the State Department had given
out that "he was no longer connected with
that branch of the service, and that for
that reason he was free to talk. To this
ho replied:
"I can"t help that. I consider that I am
connected with the department until I
have reported in Washington."
All sorts of questions were asked Mr.
Macrum relative to his leaving his post,
but all to no avail.
SIR EDMOND MONSON
HURRIES TO ROME
PARIS, 'Feb. . s.â The Echo de Paris
says: "Sir Edmond J. Monson. the Brit
ish Embassador. left Paris hastily yester
day (Sunday) morning for Rome. He had
received a cipher aispatch instructing him
to*support energetically the British Em
bassador in Rome in negotiations with
the Italian Government. Great Britain
asks Italy to land troops in accordance
with an agreement made since the Ital
ian defeat by Menelik. The Italian Cabi
net is embarrassed by the anti-English
attitude of tne population and by the po
sition of Italy in the triple alliance.
"Sir Edmond Monson has been specially
delegated to help In securing the desired
solution. In semi-official circles consid
erable doubt Is felt regarding the success
of this step, and grave international com
plications are foreseen."
The Echo <3e Paris also asserts that Sir
Philip Currie, British Embassador to
Italy, was in Paris on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday of last week In strict Incog
nito and that he had long consultations
with Sir Edmond Monson at a hotel in
the Place Vendome.
BRITISH PROFITING
BY EXPERIENCE GAINED
CAPE TOWN, Saturday. Feb. 3.â One
principle competent military observers
deduct from our assaults on the Boer po
sitions Is that with modern magazine
rifles using smokeless powder. the defense
is 10 to 1 as compared with the attack,
while formerly the rule was 3 to 1. The
results "at Mafeklng and Klmberley are
evidence of this principle, equally with
British experience at Magersfontein. A
wonderful change is taking place in the
army. The' British are grasping the new
condition of warfare. Our scouts, mount
ed infantry/Remington Guides, Little's
corps of Australians and New Zealandera
are quite able now to cope with the Boers.
Our Infantry, when moving Into faction,
now Instinctively seek cover. The depres
sion caused in England by the British re
verses has not reached the camps, where
the men are truly anxious to meet the
enemy. Â¦

MEDIATION IN AFRICA
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â To-morrow Is
suspension day in the House, but the reg

the consular and diplomatic appropriation
bill, which Chairman Hitt expects to call
up. This bill probably will raise a wide
field of discussion, touching very likely
the question of mediation In the South
African dispute. William Alden Smith of
Michigan expects to offer an amendment
for a Minister to the South African re
public and In this way the friends of the
Boers may be able to bring the question
to a test. Further discussion of the
Philippine question also is inevitable.

MAKING TROUBLE
FOR McKINLEY
Republican Opposition
to His Policy.
Ecedal Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 4.-The Herald's spe
cial correspondent sends the following
from Washington:;-
The shadows of the coming Presidential
campaign are swiftly enveloping the
Administration and Congress and the
henchmen of the various political parties.
The harmony which prevailed eighteen
months ago. has vanished. There are
many signs of discord. Those who have
time and opportunities to observe the ten
dencies of political events can see many
snags ahead for those who are now pilot
ing the ship of state.
Critics or opponents of this or that pol
icy of the Administration are found not
only In the ranks of the opposition party,
which is pretty solidly united, but also in
the ranks of the Republican party.
The stormy petrels in Congress are of
ten untrustworthy political weather
vanes, but they do not wing their wild
flights without producing some effect on
public sentiment. They have been ex
tremely active ever since the beginning of
the session.
The President probably realizes by this
time that the next eight or nine months
of his political life will not be along a
primrose path. For example, he does not
and cannot know how far the pro-Boer
demonstrations may Influence popular
sentiment against him and his Admin
istration. It is demanded that he shall
establish diplomatic relations with the
Transvaal Republic, and some members
of his own party seriously Intend to ini
tiate legislation looking to that end by
means of an amendment to the appropria
tion bill.
It also is seriously demanded that the
President shall attempt to restore peace
between the British and the Boers. This
the President will probably refuse to do.
But certain questions which confront
tho President in relation to domestic poli
cies that he has adopted or recommended
to Congress appear to threaten more se
rious trouble. What are the questions
that threaten party discord now? What
is called expansion by the Republicans
and imperialism by many Democrats, and
the problems relating. to it, are prominent
among them. Leaving wholly out of con
sideration the Atkinsons, Pettigrews,
Masons. Aliens and their followers and
sympathizers, and the so-called anti-lm
periallsts who share the views of Bryan,
there are tens of thousands, perhaps hun
dreds of thousands, of conservative citi
zens who disagree with one or another
feature of the policy of the Administra
tion, as far as it has been disclosed, re
specting the political status and civil
rights of the inhabitants of the newly ac
quired territory and the proper sort of
government or governments to be estab
lished and maintained therein.
TRIO OF HIGHWAYMEN
CAPTURED IN SACRAMENTO
John A. Mills, Their Latest Victim,
Positively Identifies
Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 4.â Through tfce
efforts of Police Officers Maley and Fitz
gerald the three desperate robbers who
have been operating In the city for some
time past are behind prison bars. They
were captured this morning after a des
perate struggle and landed In the City
Prison. They gave their names as R. M.
Gordan. Henry Spellman and A. B. Sppll
man, the latter a discharged soldier.
Shortly after 9 o'clock to-night while
John A. Mills was returning from church
he was confronted by the three men at
Thirteenth and L streets, one of whom
pointed a pistol at his head, with the
usual request to throw up hia hands. An
other of the robbers struck him on the
jaw, knocking hlnf to the ground. They
then hurriedly searched their victim,
taking a gold watch, a small amount of
money and a bunch of keys.
After the highwaymen had disappeared
Mills went to police headquarters and re
ported the robbery to Sergeant Ashe. The
latter at once detailed Officers Maley and
Fitzgerald to round up the crooks.
After considerable difficulty they learned
that after robbing Mills they walked
along Twelfth street to the levee. The
officers followed them along the levee to
Second and I streets, where they discov
ered the men In a saloon. Drawing their
revolvers. Maley and Fitzgerald entered
and, covering the desperate trio, com
manded them to surrender. A. B. Spell
man Immediately reached for his revol
ver, but was prevented from using it by
the officers.
His companions started to attack the
policemen, but were subdued after a short
fight. . They were then taken to police
headquarters and booked on a charge of
robbery* -A short time afterward their
vcitim visited the prison and positively
identified the men. The capture of the
trio is considered one of the most impor
tant made by the police of this city for a
long time. Chief Sullivan is satisfied that
the men are responsible for a number of
hold-ups that have occurred here durine
the winter.
Fatal Sunstrokes in Buenos Ayres.
BUENOS AYRES, Feb. 4.â One hundred

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A RESTAURANT EPISODE.
A Sort of Straw Vote.
An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while on
a recent Western trip, was dining one
evening In a Pittsburg restaurant.
While waiting for his order he glanced
over his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well-known dyspepsia
preparation, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
As he himself was a regular user of the
tablets he began speculating as to how
many of the other traveling men in tho
dining-room were also friends of the pop-
ular remedy "for indigestion.
He says: "I counted twenty-three men
at the tables and in the hotel office I took
the trouble to Interview them and was
surprised to learn that nine of the twen-
ty-three made a practice of taking one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets af-
ter each meal.
"One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at one
time he had been obliged to quit tho
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from ln T
digestion, but he continued their use, es-
pecially while traveling, on account of ir-
regularity in meals and because, like all
traveling men, he was often obliged to
eat what he could get and not always
what he wanted.
"Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterward because
he could eat what he pleased and when
he pleased, without fear of a sleepless
night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he was
subject to gas on stomach, causing pres-
sure on heart and lungs, shortness of
breath and distress In chest, which he no
longer experienced since using the tablets
regularly.
"Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the only safe remedy
he had ever found for sour stomach and
acidity. He had formerly used common
soda to relieve the trouble, but the tablets
were much better and safer to use."
Afater smoking, drinking or other ex-
cesses which weaken the digestive organs/
nothing restores the stomach to a
healthy, wholesome condition so effec-
tually as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain the
natural digestives, pepsin, diastase, which
every weak stomach lacks, as well as
nux, hydrastin and yellow partlla, and
can be safely relied upon as a radical
cure for every Â» form :; of poor digestion.

another term or two In the Legislature,
while not a few want to be recognized in
the distribution of Federal patronage.
They know that the people of the State,
irrespective of party, will not tolerate fur
ther obstruction or delay, hence the sen-
Bible Republicans will fall Into line next
Tuesday.
There Is some threatening talk in cer
tain quarters of the organization of a
combine to delay the election of a United
States Senator and obstruct the legislation
of the special session, but It is the talk
of pinhead politicians, who have no appre
ciation of the strength and temper of the
people or the purposes of the Republican
party.
NO ARBITRARY POWER
FOR GOVERNOR GAGE
He Will Not Be Given the Bight to
Summarily Dismiss State
Appointees.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â Governor
Gage's 6cheme to control the State pa
tronage by means ,of legislation giving
him the power of summarily dismissing
any appointive State official will fall
through. It positively will not be coun
tenanced by the members of either house.
In his message Gage proclaimed that the
object of his pet bill was that as he was
held responsible for the acts of the State
appointees he should have the right to
dismiss any one of them if he was found
wanting or did not attend to his duty.
The Legislature will absolutely refuse
to give Gage any such arbitrary power.
His intentions are so transparent that
they are easily seen through. The mem
bers look upon his action in attempting
to foist such a bill upon them as an as
sault upon the dignity of the Senate and
the Assembly, and propose to show him,
by defeating the measure, that they are
not to be trifled with.
Most of the Governor's appointments
are subject to the approval of the Senate,
and the members feel that their judgment
In such cases should not be attacked by
a Governor who would make himself a
political power by a liberal distribution of
patronage rather than by the dignity with
which he should surround his high office.
When the bill 'comes up for discussion,
It Is not thought that there will be a mem
ber with the hardihood to advocate Its
passage. As to its defeat there is no ques
tion.

MENTO. Feb. 4.â lt would require
an unusually observant critic to
filscover to-night that an extra ses
sion of the Legislature is In prog
ress, and that a question which has agi
tated the State for many months 1? un
der discussion. The haunts of the politi
cians are deserted. Conferences and ses
sions of every kind are suspended. A few
F trailing members of the Legislature are
idling in the lobby of the Golden EasÂ£
but they arÂ« doing nothing and not tam
ing much. On every hand is thÂ« an
nounced assurance that the Senatorial
contest has beÂ«n fought and won. The
victor has been proclaimed, and all that
remains is the arrangements that *m
give fonnaUty and legality to his elec
tlon.
The excitement of contending factions
and the mystery of their movements are
over The Burns headquarters is nice
a deserted churchyard. Burns returned to
Sacramento to-night, but not as a Sena
torial candidate. He has no followers, no
claquers. co rout of shouting supporters.
He is here simply as a spectator of the
Kaine. and is playing absolutely no other
part.
Amorg the men who were ready to vote
for him are many who want to see the
affair over now as quickly as the law will
permit. They recognize as clearly as the
men who vanquished them that Bard
was regularly chosen In a legal Repub
lican caucus and that on Tuesday he is
entitled to their votes. Whatever fac
tional debts they may have had they have
paid and they have the satisfaction at
least of knowing that the man who has
been chosen is representative of the best
principles of the Republican party; that
he possesses the moral and mental quali
fications to give dignity to the office to
which his party has elected him and that
without further delay he should receive
his due.
Among a few of the men who followed
Burns in his merciless and selfish de
mands upon them there is an Inclination
still to hold out In a hope that 6ome con
cessions of political or patronage value
may be held out to them. But even their
own wishes Inspire no hope, for they
know that the record of Bard Is his
pledge, that he will go to "Washington un
trammeied, unbound and absolutely free
to act upon all matters that come under
his consideration In an ofllcial capacity.
The rn-n who are seeking to barter,
even to the very last, are In a email mi
nority, however, and there Is everything
to Indicate that they will fall Into line
with those who have manhood enough
and sufficient party principle and respect
to bow to the will of the majority and
offer no obstruction to the consummation
of a victory that was well won. The men
who voted for Burns until his withdrawal
from the contest released them from their
obligations will meet to-morrow after
noon at 2 o'clock to discuss their plan of
action and determine upon a policy. To
night there are few of them who care to
ostracize u-emselves deliberately from
the great political party with which all
their hopes of a future political career
are Identified. There Is every reason to
believe, therefore, that an obstruction to
Bard'a formal election, which can have
no conclusion except to. lnjure politically
those that make It, will not materialize.
The fight has been fought and won.
Members of the Legislature returning to
the capital this evening from their respec
tive homes report that their constituents
are gratified beyond measure over the
choice of the Republican caucus for
United States Senator. It affords the peo
ple of all shades of political opinion spe
cial delight to know that the long and
bitter struggle is at an end. and that the
believing the British renunciation was
made as a result of the assurance given
by the State Department that the desired
free port, facilities would at some future
time be granted by this Government.
Western Senators may be counted upon
as strong antagonists of the proposition.
on the ground that, while sovereignty la
not surrendered, the State Department's
suggestion is a mere quibble and will have
the effect, so much feared on the Pachio
Coast, of injuring the trade of the west
ern country with Alaska and that part oC
Canada accessible through Lynn canal. .

that if Great Britain would consent to

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â
Official admission has at last been made
that negotiations have been in progress
between the United States and Great
Britain looking to the abrogation of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty. The following
statement, made to-night by an official in
a position to know the facts, may be ac
cepted as authoritative:
"Lord Pauncefote and Secretary Hay
have for some time been conducting ne
gotiations relative to the abrogation of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the au
thorities look for a favorable and early
termination."
This explains the activity of Congress
In connection with the consideration of
the construction of the Nlcaraguan canal
by the United States. It will be recalled
that The Call some time ago announced
that a member of the foreign relations
committee stated that this Government
had received information that Great Brit
ain would not oppose its construction and
control of the canal; but so fearful were
the authorities that publication of any
information at that time might be preju
dicial to the negotiations that they de
nied even that the matter had been dia
cussed by the two Governments. This
reticence has been retained until to-day,
when it was thought that negotiations
had proceeded to such a point that there
was no danger of failure and the state
ment referred to above was made.
Beyond the mere statement that nego
tlons are in progress and will early be
terminated, the authorities are not willing
to go, but there Is reason to believe that
in the discussion which has occurred the
British Government has not neglected to
bring up the question of the Alaskan
boundary controversy, and It would not
be surprising if the United States, In ex
change for the abrogation of the Clay
ton-Bulwer convention, had not agreed
to ma&e some concession in this matter.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 4.â lf this extraordinary
session of the California Legislature Is
prolonged beyond a reasonable and eco
nomical period the responsibility will lie
with Governor Gage. Assemblyman H.
C. Dibble, the Governor's mouthpiece on
the floor of the Assembly, has announced
that the Governor will veto the bills ap
propriating money for contingent and
other expenses unless the figures pro
posed by him through Assemblyman Val
entine are accepted.
In other words, the Governor presumes
to dictate to the Legislature Just the
amount it shall spend and the date upon
which It shall adjourn. When the appro
priation bllla were set before him yester
day he made Dibble's threat good by re
fusing to sign them. Instead he took the
afternoon train and went to San Francis
co.
The Legislature is not ready to stand
for the Governor's dictation. It is known
now that instead of vetoing the appro
priation bills outright he intends to let
them He upon his desk for ten days and
let them go without his signature.
There is to-night not one member of
either house who is not informed of this
Intention, and there are few who have not
resolved to hold the session over the ten
days for the sole purpose of overriding
his veto.
With the members of the Legislature
Gage stands discredited. From the con
vening of the first session he has attempt
ed by one means and another to control
and direct legislation to his own ends and
to those of his masters.
The Legislature is heartily sick of the
whole business, and now that he has at
tempted to go to. the extent of cutting oft
their pay and reimbursement for their
actual expense they are determined to
call a halt.
To-night they are ready to wait thirty
days if it is necessary to undo the Gov
ernor's veto and wrest from him what is
rightly their due and which he guaran
teed them when he called an extra ses
sion. It may prolong the session, but if
Gage desires it his will will be done.

Incidents of the Recent
Rebellion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Fab. 4.â Mall advices from
Hongkong contain news of the late revolt
In British North Borneo. Natives along
the whole west coast arose In arms
against the chartered British Company
operating there. They were led by the
notorious outlaw Mat Sellah, who led the
rebellion against the British there several
years ago. That rebellion was ended by
the managing director of the company
going to Labuan and paying Sellah a
large sum to disperse his followers and be
good. His money having been spent, Sel
leh organized the recent rebellion on a
greater scale than ever.
An expedition comprising 230 sikhs or
native soldiers and' bluejackets left
Lebuan last month. Several miles out
they were stacked by rebels from ambush
and a number were killed. The British
force then fell back to await reinforce
ments.
Evidently these reinforcements were re
ceived, and the advance renewed, as cable
advices have announced the success of
the expedition. Several hundred of the
rebels were killed or wounded.
Six rich residents have arrived at Hong
kong from Borneo to remain until the war
13 over. At Gaya Bay Sellah's men raided
the Chinese shops, carrying off much
booty. Two Government messengers are
missing, and are believed to have been
murdered. The gunboat Rattler went from
I^abuan to Gaya to be near the scene of
warfare.
To make maters worse, the Tambanan
and Tesallia3 tribes In the Interior are
fighting against each other, with a cer
tainty that the victorious tribo will aug

NEGRO DISFRANCHISEMENT.
THE country has listened, with a degree of in
difference, to the speeches of Senators Morgan
and Money in vindication of the disfranchise-
I ment of negroes in the Southern States, to be-ef
! fected by constitutional amendments. Senator Chand-
I ler offered a bit of perfunctory opposition, as did
i Senator Pritchard of North Carolina, but no one
I suggested that Federal authority, under the fifteenth
! amendment, could be invoked to save the imperiled
Â¦ citizenship of the negroes. In at least three Southern
I States the black vote is in a majority, but it is never
I made effective at the polls, and the white minority
I dominates, undisturbed and without protest. In
I many other States the negro holds the balance of
! power between two almost equal parties composed
j of whites, but its balance is never thrown in the scale,
j for neither white party dare accept its affiliation and
I take office and power at its hands. The South has
I grown tired and perhaps ashamed of lawless suppres
! sion of the negro vote, and seeks to make the same
! act lawful by cunningly devised constitutional disa
; bilities. As a mass the negroes are indifferent to the
; franchise. When one of them, equipped with iritel
â¢ ligence, essays leadership of the rest and seeks to
i rouse in them a sense of the value of the ballot to
\ them, and the necessity for maintaining their right to
; it, he is marked as an agitator and his position at
j once becomes one of personal peril.
When impeached for the nullification of a con
: stitutional right belonging to the negroes, the whites
j rcrpond with an argument to prove that the stronger
I race must rule, regardless of numbers, and that negro
j government of whites means anarchy.
The country has seen the reconstruction acts fall
i one after another. The civil rights law, the force bill,
i the election law â all are gone. No statute intended
I to accentuate the results of the Civil War remains,
i All have been swept away in the slow reaction that
Â¦ has followed the mighty exertion of energy in which
'Â¦ they had birth. Every impression made by that ex
ertion has faded except two, and these are in the con-
I stitution itself. One is the amendment abolishing
j slavery and the other that which gave the franchise
Ito the negro. The latter is being obsolcted by State
i nullification, and is to-day as powerless and ineffec
| tive as a by-law of Solon. Accepting this situation,
'< it is well to look into the future. What will be the
: effect upon parties? Will a new alignment come
j when the South is delivered from fear of negro dom
Â¦ ination? The Democratic leaders who are respon
1 sible for this nullification of the Federal constitution
j look to it as a useful party measure. Its first effect
I will be the surrender of such part of the Southern
; representation in Congress as is based upon the sup
| pressed negro vote. The fourteenth amendment to
I the Federal constitution says: "Representatives
I shall be apportioned among the several States ac
cording to their respective numbers,. counting â¢ the
whole number of persons in each State, excluding
Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at
any election for the choice of electors for President
I and Vice President, representatives in Congress, the
j executive and judicial officers of a State, oc the
\ members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any
lof the male inhabitants thereof, or in any -way
Â¦abridged except for participation in rebellion or
other crime, the basis of representation therein shall
be reduced in the proportion which the number of
such male citizens shall bear to the whole number
of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such
State." . '
It is estimated that enforcement of this provision
will reduce the Southern representation in the House
by about* one-third. The justice of such reduction
cannot be successfully denied. The white people of
ON AN EVEN KEEL
THE volume of trade throughout the United
States, as exhibited by the bank clearings, fell
off 25.1 per cent last week, as compared with
the corresponding week in 1899. As in the preceding
week, the largest cities in the country showed the
greatest loss, New York falling behind 33.1 per cent,
Chicago 4.2 per cent, Boston 29.7 per cent, Baltimore
22.3 per cent, and so on. San Francisco showed a
gain of 7.9 per cent.
But it must not be inferred from this exhibit that
trade has become dull. Far from it. The movement
of merchandise is large all over the land, the decrease
being merely comparative. It must not be forgotten
that iSyg was a phenomenal year. The panic of 1893
left cfTects which lasted a long time, and it was only
a year or so ago that times began to show marked
improvement. Then everybody began to buy goods.
During the years of depression stocks of everything
had become depleted and it required a year of steady
purchasing to replenish them. The buying was fever
ish. Nothing like it had ever been seen before. Un
der the abnormal demand "prices rose continuously,
but this apparently made no difference. Everybody
went on buying just the same. Not until the close
of the year did the wonderful demand slacken. It had
continued long after it was supposed to be satisfied,
and commercial authorities were beginning to wonder
if it ever would cease.
But as far as figures are any indication, this rush to
buy has ceased. Stocks of everything have been re
plenished everywhere. This does not necessarily
mean that a period of dullness will ensue, but it does
mean that the rush is over. The winter trade has been
quiet, owing, according to some theorists, to excep
tionally mild weather; but the demand for spring
goods has been, and is to-day, brisk. Money has be
come much easier in all positions, both here and
abroad; all fears of financial stringency have vanished,
and the country is now on a normal basis again, sub
ject to the orderly law of supply and demand. Spec
ulation is cautious, for the memory of the great panic
of 1893 is still fresh in the public mind, and nobody
desires a repetition of it. With moderation there is
no reason why trade should not continue active ani
healthy for some years, though the unprecedented
rush of 1899 may not be repeated in this generation.
Perhaps it will be as well if it is not, for booms hatch
panics.
According to the commercial reports, business last
week was featureless.* There was neither excitement
nor depression in any line. Aside from the decrease
of 25 per cent in the bank clearings, there was no un
favorable sign. The failures were only 171, against
207 for the same week in 1899. The restoration of
normal monetary conditions in Wall street encour
aged the public to again operate in that mart, and
fresh money accordingly appeared. It is gratifying
to note that this fresh money was after permanent in
vestments rather than quick turns, and sought divi
dends rather than momentary profits. Hence there
was more or less activitiy in bonds and gilt-edged
dividend-paying securities. As long as this disposi
tion endures there will be no disturbance in the coun
try's speculative center.
This, in brief, is the record of last week in trade.
Its very lack of color makes it interesting, as show
ing a corresponding lack of that fever which has char
acterized business for over a year. If the pendulum
does not swing to the other extreme we shall ha\e
a Dutch year, the expression being synonymous with
tranquil prosperity.
THE WARNINGS TO PHELAN.
WE have reached the day announced by Mayor
Phelan as the date that would see Commis
sioner Biggy removed from office, and the
Police Commission prepared to carry out the agree
ment made before the election to turn the police force
over to Esola as Chief, to be used for the purposes of
A. M. Lawrence and others of his class. If the Mayor
have any self respect left he will abandon the inten
tion he so indiscreetly announced. The swallowing
of his words may be a bitter medicine, but it will be
better to take it than to commit political suicide in a
moment of insanity.
In the first place it is now evident it will not be
easy to carry out the programme. To fix the board
to suit the gamblers it will be necessary not only to
remove Biggy but to accept the resignation of
Thomas. Then the Mayor will have to find two citi
zens willing to accept commissionerships under an
express and open agreement to elect Esola and to
obey the blacklegs who wish to run a wide-open town.
The men who accept office under such terms will have
to be shameless indeed, for they will have to confront
everything in the form of private scorn and public
contempt. i
Those facts are in themselves sufficient to make the
Mayor pause, but they are not the only matters per
tinent to the issue that give him reason to lie awake
at nights and ponder upon the advisability of reced
ing while there is yet an opportunity to do so. The
removal of Biggy will result in an appeal to the
courts, and Phelan and Lawrence know very well
what will happen then. It will be an occasion when,
as Portia said: "We shall have old swearing." Esola
will not be the only man of the gang who upon the
witness stand will find it convenient to have a very
short memory- There will be others, but in spite of
their failure to remember, there will be no lack of
evidence to establish the truth concerning that ne
farious bargain, which, after denying for a time, the
Examiner has since admitted by charging that Com
missioner Biggy has broken a pledge made to the
Mayor when he refused to vote for Esola.
Moreover, the Mayor has had warnings. They
have been uttered in public by men like Stewart Men
zies, Joseph Britton and Morris M. Estee; and in
private by a host of others who supported him before
they knew of his disreputable associations and dis
honorable bargains with blackmailers and other pre
datory creatures. Even some of the most strenuous
campaigners like James H. Barry have revolted from
him since the disclosures have been made, and on
Saturday the Star, which has always upheld him in
the past, denounced him and his scheme in terms that
cannot be misunderstood.
Finally, Mayor Phelan may find it profitable to
study the moral contained in the defeat of Burns at
Sacramento. The spirit that animated the stanch
Republicans and roused the storm of indignation that
drove Burns, Herrin and all the bosses and touts of
the railroad and the tenderloin from the Senatorial
contest, is not confined to Republicans, nor is its
force felt only in districts outside the city. It is a
spirit which now inspires the intelligence of Califor
nia generally and is found among worthy Democrats
as well as among Republicans. It is a spirit of revolt
against bosses, against corruption, against all forms
of dishonesty in politics. It has crushed at Sacra
mento the vast and long established machinery of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, and can easily crush the
petty combination of rascals that the Mayor seeks to
serve. If, therefore, he be wise or even have ordi
nary prudence, he will not attempt to remove Com
missioner Biggy, but out of his private fortune will
pay Lawrence what he owes him and let the rest of
the gang howl as they may.
Great Britain leads, with nearly one
thrid of the total tonnage, and the United
States stands sixth, while Italy is lowest
on the list.
The subject of superimposed turrets,
adopted in the battleships Kearsarge and
Kentucky, is discussed at great length
and with thoroughness by the London En
gineer. After considering the advantages
and drawbacks that paper expresses lta
adverse opinion as follows: "On the
whole, then, while we are bound to ad
mit that the saving In weight and the re
duction of machinery Is advantageous,
we do not see that sufficient Is gained to
balance the many disadvantages of hav
ing all the eggs in one basket and all the
weapons In one hand." The Kearsarge
and Kentucky were contracted for in
January. 189$, and sufficient time haa
elapsed for other navies to adopt the sys
tem. That It has not been adopted wouM
indicate that foreign naval experts enter
tain doubts as to It 3 practical utility, and
that actual tests alone will demonstrate
It. The ships have not gone through such
trials and the opposition of some of the
Bureau Chiefs to double turrets In the
three battleships now being designed Is
not unreasonable.
LOOMING FEATURES IN
TROUBLED OIL FIELDS
"Scrippers" Are Carefully Planning a Test Case
Against Mineral Claimants.
IN a long-range view of the California
petroleum industry, in which the
multiplying new derricks of various
oil fields providing most of the cur
rent oil news are lost to view, several
Important features stand out to attract
attention.
One is that the Kern River district In
Kern County, while still in the boom
stage, has demonstrated that it will be
one of the Important oil fields of the
State. While no wells have reached
great depths several are producing In
considerable quantities and their distri
bution shows that productive strata
underlie a district of several square mile*.
An oil district is an oil district when Its
land is being grabbed by rushers and
parted among suckers though no oil has
been really found. The point about the
Kern River district Is that it has become
a legitimate oil field through actual dis
covery and production and Is regarded
as a promising one by conservative oil
experts. Not much oil has been shipped,
but the supply still underground na.i
been largely contracted for in advance,
partly by the Santa Fe company, which
will useoi! for engine fuel on the Valley
road exclusively.
It remains to be seen how much wider
the oroductlve area will expand and
how extensive and lasting will be the
yield. Prospecting wells will determine
the limits of the field and much deeper
ones will show what there is and how
much of it in the deeper strata below.
It is quite possible that this new Held
will add largely to the output of 1000.
There Is, of course, the same possibility
with other new districts now being ex
ploited.
For forty years Contra Costa County
has lured attention to its many oil indi
cations, consisting of seepages and out
cropplngs of bituminous sandstone strata,
and several unprofitable wells have been
put down in the region of Mount Diablo.
The new oil boom with Its more vigor
ous and more thorough search for oil Is
likely soon to determine about what
Contra Costa County amounts to as an
oil field. '
Prospecting operations of varying im
portance atid promise have been begun
near Orlnda Park and in the neighbor
hood of Pleasanton and Mount Diablo,
but the operations that will attract most
attention are new ones Ju3t planned by
some high officials of the Santa te Rail
road. A company which includes Cmei
Engineer Storey, Traffic Manager \V . A.
Blssell. Alexander Mackie. secretary of
the Valley road, anu A. B. Butler has
acquired options on tracts of several
thousand acres in the San Pablo range
of hills overlooking the town of San
Pablo and the bay. Part of the land Is
owned by J. S. Hlttell. the historian.
The bonds contain stringent requirements
for prospecting operations and material
for a derrick was ordered to the ground
last week. It is well understood that the
ground will be prospected thoroughly at
a cost of thousands of dollars under ex
pert direction, and the standing of the
men behind the operations, who are not
lending themselves to f. stock deal, and
who have acquired faith that good oil
can come out of the bay region, will in
spire hope that pipe lines will yet bloom
a Those who 'have known of this quiet
deal have supposed that the Santa Fe
Company was looking for oil there near
Its bay terminus, but Mr. Storey states
that it is entirely a private venture on the
part of those making it. For a long dis
tance through the region covered there
are outcroppings of an irregular Band
stone stratumf highly tilted, yielding
slight oil seepages, and In places masses
of solidified bitumen. Prospect wells will
rapidly develop the depth and contents of
the uandstone. Should an oil supply be
developed the Santa Fe would of course
be the consumer. 'l^i'" ?,
Before long the Santa Fe Company will
be practically through with burning coal
In California. Oil is its fuel on all its
Southern California lines, and five engines
north of Tehachapl have been within a
few days equipped for oil burning. As
stated, it will use oil exclusively all the
way to San Francisco, getting what oil
it can from the San Joaquin Valley and
the rest from Southern California. Chief
Engineer Storey tested the light oil of the
Coallnga field on the Valley road some
time ago and thinks that its very excel
lence makes It unsafe for locomotive use,
as it is too volatile.
The huge legal tangle over the rights of
mineral and agricultural claimants ta
public petroleum lands, especially In tht
Ban Joaquin Valley, steadily develops
the long and lurid struggle with which It
Is pregnant. The California Miners' As
sociation is committed to the petroleum
miners' cause, and the combined forces
are ready for a move on Washington,
while all sortÃ of courts are busy out
here. In accordance with the preceding
action of the executive committee, John
M. Wright, chairman of the mineral lands
committee of the California Miners' As
sociation, last week sent the followng to
the secretary of the Petroleum Miners'
Co-operative Association, Fresno. Cal.:
Dear Sir: As chairman of the Mineral Lands
Committee of California Miners' Association
I am directed to advise you that at a meeting
of the executive committee of. said Miners'
Association held in this city on the 26th day
of January of the present year said Mineral
Lands Committee was Instructed on behalf of
the California Miners' Association to prepare
and urge for passage by the Congress of the
United States an act amending the mining
laws of the United States so as to give to lo
cators of petroleum lands privileges analogous
to the rights enjoyed by locators of tunnels and
tunnel sites under the provisions of section
2323 of the Revised Statutes of the United
The 'proposed amendment will protect the oil
locator while drilling for oil with reasonable
diligence within the limits of his claim during
a prescribed period after the staking and mark
ing thereof, so that discovery during such
period shall relate back and take effect nunc
pro tune as of the time of such staking and
marking of the claim.
I shall be pleased to receive suggestions from
your association as to the proper wording of
the proposed amending statute. And In this
connection I may suggest that it should be
brief in terms and that It will probably be best
to have it i>a6sed as an amendment to said sec
tion 2323 of the Revised Statutes, or as an
amendment to the statute approved by the
President on February 11. 1897, defining petro
leum lands as mineral lands.
It is my further duty to Inform you that said
executive committee at its said meeting pledged
to your association the support and co-opera
tion of the California Miners' Association In
the matter of the pending contest between the
locators of petroleum lands and the so-called
"forest reserve Bcrlppers." It Is to be hoped
that there may be hearty co-operation between
the two associations In the aforesaid matters.
Uncle Sam has divided his empire among
three childrenâ the farmer, the miner and
Collls P. Huntington. To the miner he set
apart all that the two others couldn't get
away from him, saying that his portion
should be that "more valuable for mining
than for agriculture.' He meant it for
the miner's good and blessed him. Since
then the railroads have been able to take
about anything they wanted within their
enormous land grant limits, and when the
miner protested In behalf of his heritage
that it was mineral land the railroad arid
the other land-grabbers said, "You can't
prove It." And the Commissioner of the
General Land Office and the Secretary of
the Interior and all the learned Judges
have said: "No: he can't prove It." They
have said: "There may surely be miner
als there, as you say, but have you really
discovered them In a particular place, and
if bo, have you actually worked a profit
able mine there? If not. it is agricultural
land, though a horned toad would die
thereon." : The miner has been required
to prove a negative, has b*Â»Â«n denied the
benefit of all "presumptions" and has been
made to show that a profitable mine could
be opened. on the land at issue, while the
agricultural claimant is * not required to
show that a hill of blue, beans could be
raised thereon.
Tha "two terras "discovery** and â¢Vafti
jÂ»blÂ« quantities" are at thÂ« bottom of moat
of the miner's legal troubles in claiming
public land, and they are at the bottom
of the oil miners' present troubles.
There are two views of the troubleâ tne
legal view and the other one. In the
legal view the miner has no rights with
a contested mineral location unless that
"discovery" has been made and in /valu
able quantities." That is why the oil
miners in the San Joaquin Valley who
have located many thousands of acres
have the worst of the fight with the
scrippers. The oil is not on the surface in
valuable quantities, and when he starts
a hole where he may know oil will be
struck, another man may come along be
fore his drill has reached oil. locate it as
agricultural land, stop the miner and get
it, regardless of its value for agricul
ture.
Circuit Judge Ross of Los Angeles has
recently been putting these established
doctrines Into force, and now Land Com
missioner Hermann has Just Interposed
them again in behalf of the agricultural
scripper. - :---â¢-.: ---â¢-.
A decision by him. dated January 22.
1900. addressed to the Register and Re
ceiver of the Los Angeles Land Office, has
lust been received, which decides that no
hearings against the scrippers' titles will
be ordered by the General Land Office at
the instance of the mineral claimants,
unless the protests filed against the scrip
entry show that the land in question Is
actually producing oil in valuable quanti
ties. Tne following extract from the com
mission's decision shows how little
grounds for hope the placer mining lo
cators have from that source: ; .-:
On December 12. 1599. James W. McDonald.
Los Angeles, Cal., filed in this office a protest
and petition for a hearing. The protest alleges
the location of the La Malllla mining claim In
conflict with the above selection. The affiants
claim to have thoroughly prospected the land,
and find that It is mineral land containing great
deposits of petroleum: "that a vein of pe
troleum running all through the said land Is
most clearly and unequivocally defined. There
Is so much petroleum therein contained that
the same has forced its way to the surface.
and the superficial earth is so completely sat
urated with petroleum that It burns when a
light Is applied to It. In several parts whers
there are declivities the oil In a liquid state
exudes from the sides of the banks."
The protest does not. even with the showing
made, present sufficient reasons to warrant
this office In allowing an order for a hearing.
The date of the mineral location is not shown,
but there Is lacking the essential consideration
In all this class of cases â specific evidence of
the development of the land for its mineral
product and the production therefrom in quan
tities and qualities sufficient to indicate that
the land is more valuable for mineral than for
BKricultural purposes. In the absence of this
showing a hearing should not bo ordered.
By the way, who and what are those
"ecrlppers" who are -making so much
trouble, threatening bloodshed and Inter
minable lawsuits? Not many clearly
know. In times past areas of the public
domain, partly neld by locators have
been withdrawn from sale or location, as
Indian or other reservations, or for other
reasons, and locators divested of their
lands were given certificates by which
they could transfer their right to any
other similar subdivision of public land
open. These certificates have been called
"scrip," and those using them "scrip
pers." Scrip was negotiable and acquired
market value. In California public land
scrip brokerage has long been a business
Not very much la left. "Porter scrip
commands about $5. "Valentine scrip" is
worth $50. There Is considerable State lieu
land scrip at $4. The San Joaquln Valley
oil belts are arid and have largely re
mained in the public domain because no
body wanted the land. The oil boom gave
the land great demand and the rushers
went at It in two ways. Thousands filed
mineral locations. Others rushed for
"scrip" and located "agricultural land"
with it, plastering It all over the mineral
claims, and hence the war.
Those who have used the scrip men
tioned are properly scrippers, but the
great majority of the scrippers are only
so-called scrippers. The woes of the oil
locators date largely from the establish
ment of the big Sierra Nevada forest re
serves. An act of Congress of June 4. IK*7,
provided, concerning these reserves, "chat
In cases in which a tract covered by an
imperfected bona fide claim or by a patent
is included within the limits of a public
forest reservation the settler or owner
thereof may. If he desires to do so. relin
quish the tract to the Government, and
may select in lieu thereof a tract of va
cant land open to settlement." etc.
While Important Issues have already
been Joined in the Federal courts, leading
scrippers are carefully planning a test
case, which has not yet been filed, though
the brief has been drawn by A. H. Rlck
etts. A big array of lawyers has been
engaged, consisting of A. H. Ricketts, F.
M. Stone, Jefferson Chandler, Van Ness
and Redmond and Shirley J. Ward and
Attorney Pope of Los Angeles.
The complaint will recite a forest re
serve scrlpper's right, vested in him by
the laws and his acts, holding his title is
as perfect as it was in' the land ex
changed, and allege the entry of the de
fendants on the land to search for min
eral oil. The defendants have located
mineral claims on the land before dis
covery, but If oil Is discovered that would
establish the mineral nature of the land
and oust the scripper, who seeks to eject
the miner, as mineral locations made af
ter discovery would be valid.
The plaintiff oddly but legally and safe
ly complains as a basis for his prayer that
"If the land Is believed to possess oil it
greatly enhances the value thereof,
whereas If defendants, by their wrongful
and continuous trespass, demonstrate
that petroleum Is not to be found on said
land, the market value thereof, to which
your orator is clearly entitled, will be
diminished and lost."
The agricultural claimant prays the
court to protect him from the discovery
that It is not mineral but agricultural
land and that he is thus fully entitled to
It. But that Is proper before the law.
Here, as elsewhere. It is the technical
matter of discovery and valuable quan
tity that will determine rights.
The equities of the situation are mixed.
The scrlpper is really after oil, or rather
after land or stock to sell, as Is the min
eral claimant as a rule. Discovered oil
fields will be developed If they are cov
ered by orange groves or office buildings.
The Los Angeles field is in a city, and
most producing oil land was first In pri
vate hands, Ihe scrinper seeks the land
under false pretenses, which are legally
sustained. He says, "I want to mine
here because It is agricultural land." He
"Jumps" other men's claims and acts ap
parently according to law, making the
miners do so. too, and keeping within his
legal rights. His rights are often wrong
and the law needs reconstruction. The
Importance of the Issue la wider than the
oil fields. J. O. DENNY.
THE SENATORIAL SITUATION.
DESPITE rumors that the ' thick and thin
supporters of Burns will refuse to follow the
majority of the Republican caucus, and will
make a bitter fight against the nominee of the cau
cus, it is not at all likely any considerable number of
them will do so. ' In the moment of their first feeling
of soreness in defeat some of them, indeed, made such
threats, but with the quiet of Sunday they have had
time to reflect and reconsider. When the time comes
we may expect a well nigh unanimous Republican
vote for Bard.
The only parties who can expect to gain anything
by continuing the fight are the bosses and pojitical
manipulators of the Southern Pacific Railroad. They
stand at present utterly discredited. Their* loud
boasts of an ability to dictate to the Republican party
in California have been proven false. In a contest in
which they appeared openly and in which they made
use of all their resources and powers for bribing or
for threatening, they have been completely beaten.
It might benefit them a little to carry the fight further
for the purpose of inducing Huntington to believe
they have still some strength left, or for the purpose
of bringing about some sort of a compromise that
will let them retire with a show of honor; but no one
else can gain anything at all. The legislators who
would serve the railroad purposes in making such a
fight would simply ruin themselves for nothing.
Even those members of the Burns following who
have no higher wisdom than that of cunning can per
ceive that the time has come to follow the example
of Burns himself and quit the fight. Reports from all
parts of the State show that Republicans everywhere
rejoice over the action of the caucus on Saturday and
hail the nomination of Mr. Bard as a most fortunate
outcome of the prolonged contest. It would not have
been possible to make a nomination which has met
with more general approval. From every point of
view it is in the highest degree gratifying. The nomi
nee is not only personally worthy of the honor and
free from all alliances or affiliations with the railroad,
or any other corrupting force in the State; but the
fact that he comes from the south adds to the popu
lar gratification, since that makes his victory not only
a triumph over Burns, but blocks the further inten
tion of the conspirators to have followed the election
of Burns by that of Gage as a Senator from the south
when Perkins' term expires.
As the prospects present themselves this morning
the situation is all that the true Republicans of the
State can desire. The victory has been attained for
honesty, the Southern Pacific has been driven from
such hold as it had upon a minority faction of the
party; and now there is no reason why there should
any longer be dissensions in the Republican camp.
An opportunity of rare value is offered for restoring
harmony in the party councils and among the rank
and file, and making everything ready for a united
and vigorous course of action in the approaching
Presidential campaign. That opportunity no wise
Republican can afford to overlook. It is hardly pos
sible there can be any in the Legislature so blind as
not to perceive it, or so stupid as not to understand
his own relations to it. The time has come to put
an end to the strife which Burns and the Southern
Pacific have stirred up in the party during the past
year, and the first step to that end will be the election
of Thomas R. Bard to the United States Senate by
the unanimous Republican vote.
the South cannot eat their cake and keep it. They
cannot claim power .in Congress based upon enum
erating a population to which they permit no voice in
their government. But this is not the final and most
significant effect of nullification of the negroes' right
to vote. Wherever in the border States the negro
vote is so small as to cause no fear of its domina
tion the Republican party has become firmly estab
lished. In Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and
Kentucky it is strong. Its strength declines as the
negro population increases, and is at its lowest where
there is a black majority. Twice Republicans have
carried Tennessee for Governor, and have been al
most openly counted out When the Democrats of
the South succeed in legally striking down the negro
franchise they will have removed the only argument
they have used for thirty years against the Repub
lican party. When it is done Delaware, Maryland,
West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
North Carolina and Louisiana will quickly become
Republican States. Their commercial and productive
interests will irresistibly lead them into the party
which makes those interests its first concern. Every
cotton mill, every iron furnace, every coal mine,
every sugar, tobacco and rice plantation in the South
is a Republican missionary. Eight of the original
slave States have but one political future and party
destiny, and that is with the Republican party. The
disorderly and disorganizing course of Southern
Democratic politicians, by which they struck down
the only successful leader the party has had in nearly
fifty years, was not so much the result of personal
malevolence as of the malaise of unnatural politics.
The natural position of these States was with the Re
publican party, and when they had an administration
of their own party its application of Democratic
principles to government policy smote them and
caused afflictions which they wrongly ascribed to
the administration, instead of to the principles they
had themselves advocated.
We know not whether they now foresee the con
sequences of what they are doing. If they do, they
are knowingly wise, for they are removing the last
barrier between them and the party with whose prin
ciples their material interests are at one. If they know
not what they are doing, they are unintentionally
wise, for the final effect is sure to be the same.

"THE BEAUTIFUL CITY."
Eloquent Address of Dr. Jordan at
Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb 4.â
President David Starr Jordan spoke in
the university chapel this morning, taking
as the subject of his text "The Beautiful
City." The whole discourse was a plea
for the proper attitude of the individual
toward his surroundings. Everything that
exists is for a purpose, and if viewed
from the proper standpoint is beautiful.
There is nothing in nature that is not
perfect to that form of life which has
perfectly adapted Itself. "Even the Mo-
Jave Desert. said the speaker, "fur
nishes a perfect home for Its plant and
animal life. â¢ Â¦"""?;
"Once the world was a vale of tears, a
place of awful penitence, illumined only
by the grace of God. To-day we rejoice
in It for we realize that it is the grace
of God which shines though and illumines
it for us. ;
"Adaptation to conditions brings happi
ness. If we see things as they are, and
what lies behind them, we are building
for harmony. We are well in all that's
well that we do well, that we strive well
for It is an old saying that no harm can
come to the good man, be he alive or
"We should give thanks for the infinite
justice of things; that ugliness, inhar
mony and wrong bring failure; that har

every good thing and it turns to bad. But
all wrong Is only good uncompleted. Vice
is good impulse premature nnd ineffective
anger, a reaction premature and fatuous.
War itself, one of the greatest curses of
the world, is but misdirected courage. To

the test of a strong life."

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â
From the breaking out of the war with
Spain to the present time the total ex
penditures of the Government on account
of that war and on account of the hostili
ties in the Philippines, amount In round
figures to about $355,000,000.
It is Impossible to calculate accurately
the cost of the war for the reason that it
is not possible to tell In all cases Just
how much expenditures made under a
given heading are in excess of those that
would have been made had it not been for
the war. As nearly as can be estimated
the war expenditures have been about as
follows:
On account of the War Department,
J255,000,G00; on acount of the Navy Depart
ment." $69,000,000; paid to Spain for the
Philippines, $20,000,000; interest on war
loan to date, $9,000,000; Increased expenses
In departmental service In Washington,
$2,000,000. Total war expenditures, $355,
000,000.
The national defense fund of $50,000,000,
voted by Congress on the eve of the
breaking out of the war, was placed at
the disposal of the President without any
limitations whatever and allotments from
it were made to various departments as
needed to meet expenditures for which
Congress had not specifically appro
priated. '
The largest allotments, $29,973,274 22, was
made to the Navy Department, and was
principally used for the purchase of ves
sels, guns, ammunition and supplies. Some
of the principal items of expenditure un
der this allotment were: Purchase of ves
sels, $17,780,485 27; alterations and repairs
to vessels, $1,111,474 54; bureau of ordnance
(guns, ammunition, etc.), $5,582,888 45; pur
chase of guns, ammunition and supplies
abroad, $1,327,017 26; buildings, etc., at
navy yards, stations, $690,857 18; hire and
running expenses, chartered vessels, $475,
422 87.
Allotments amounting to $18,959,627 68
were made to the War Department from
which principal expenditures were: Under
ordnance bureau, $9,081,496 86; under en
gineer bureau, $585,000; under quartermas

bureau, $1,520,000.
Allotments of $325,118 68 to State De

to be used for expenses Incurred by these

Louis Laviosa, a San Rafael Butcher,
Fears That His Caracci Will
Be Stolen.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 4.â Three hundred
years ago In Bologna lived Annlbale Car
raccl, who painted pictures which have
made his name one of the most Illus
trious among the old masters. It Is ow
ing to this fact that Loui3 Laviosa, a lo
cal groceryman, knows no peace. In a
dingy back attic over his store lies
wrapped In a greasy newspaper and in
closed in a cheap, tarnished frame a valu
able painting by Carraccl. It represents
the temptation of St. Anthony, and is In
Caracci' s best style.
Laviosa brought the picture with him
to this country from Genoa, where It had
hung on the wall of his father's home for
countless generations. When It was de
cided that the family should emigrate the
old picture was brought too. In New
York laviosa met Virgil Tojettl, who
pronounced the painting a genuine
Carraccl, and Informed Laviosa that its
worth ranged high in the thousands.
Things did not prosper with the Laviosas
in Gotham, and so they came to Cali
fornia. Some time since an unscrupulous
picture-hunter got wind of the gem which
Laviosa possessed, and money being re
fused resorted to strategy and a dark lan
tern. Luckily his attempt to gain pos
session of the painting by stealth was
frustrated. Ever since then, however, the
picture has been a weight on Laviosa's
mind, and the thought of the treasure in
his garret causes him to look with sus
picion on the casual stranger who "hap
pens In" with an order for half a pound
of butter or a packet of tea. The gro
ceryman has concluded that a bank is
the safest place for his picture, as he
feels that even the greasy paper wrapper
would not throw off the track the astute
connoisseur who had set his heart on the
possession of the Carraccl.

Monterey to a central point In the valley,
so that the beets may be loaded direct

MILL VALLEY, Feb. 4.â An Insane car
penter named Wilson armed with a hatch
et chased Charles Stark, a local butcher,
through the main street here yesterday,
and for several minutes panic prevailed
among' the townspeople. Later the man
was placed In Sausalito jail and nar
rowly escaped being drowned by the tide
invading his cell and converting his place
of Incarceration into a watery grave.
At about nocn yesterday Stark was
walking past the place of business occu
pied by Harvey Klyce, a builder, anfi Wil
son's employer, when a warning shout
from the opposite side of the street made
him turn. He saw Wilson brandishing a
glittering adze within a few feet of him.
Realizing that he was attacked by a ma
niac, Stark took to his heels, pursued by
the lunatic shrieking at the top of his
voice. Fear lent Stark wings and he
managed to keep ahead of his pursuer,
although he was every moment losing
strength. The insane man had raised his
weapon for a blow, which would have
crushed the butcher's skull like an egg
shell, when Constables Magner and Mc-
Donald arrived on the scene. A blow
from Magner*3 club brought Wilson to
time, and the officer was about to DlacÂ«Â»
handcuffs on him when he sprang up and
attempted to fell Magner by a vicious
blow. So violent did he become that a
second blow was needed to render him
submissive to arrest. Wilson was Â»aken
to Sausalito on an evening train Â«xnd
placed in the jail, a one-story structure,
which would be dignified by the title of
hog pen. It Is below the level of the sea,
and in the night when the tide rose It
burst the levee, and the unfortunate Wil
son came very near being drowned. When
Constable Richard Garrity visited the tall
this morning he found the prisoner shiv
ering in his wet clothes. Wilson was
taken out and placed in a temporary place
of confinement. No complaint has yet
been lodged against him by Stark, but it
is understood that the butcher will charge
his assailant with assault to murder. The
townspeople have no hesitation in declar
ing Wilson to be Insane.

THE GROWTH OF SHAKESPEARE'S FAME.

XIX SCHOOLS OF SHAKESPEARE
CRITICISM.
Shakespeare's Contemporary Beputa
tion.
Shakespeare's life was from every point
of view successful. He came up to Lon
don a penniless youth, literally to seek
hl3 fortune, and retired a quarter of a
century later with an Income which his
latest biographer estimates as equivalent
to some $25,000 in our day. He was a
talented actor and the most "drawing"
dramatist of a theater-going age. He
was distinguished by the special favor of
Elizabeth and James I Is said to have
written him an autograph letter. Short
ly after his withdrawal from London six
of his plays were performed during the
splendid marriage festivities of the
Princess Elizabeth and the Elector Pala
tine. Elizabethan literature, too. swarms
with references to Shakespeare's plays
and poems. From a rather "doubtful allu
sion by Spenser In the early 90's down to
the "Epitaph" by Milton In 1632 we have
an unbroken chain of references, and
with the one exception of Greene's out
burst of railing jealously the tone of
these is one of praise.
Yet It was reputation rather than fame
that Shakespeare gained In his lifetime.
While his contemporaries valued, they
cannot be said to have appreciated him.
He was considered only as one of the
great poets of an age that recognized its
own greatness. That he towered far
above his fellows no one of them was
clear-sighted enough to perceive. By
some of the greatest thinkers of his
age â Bacon, for Instance, and John Sel
denâhe Is not so much as named. Meres,
indeed, assigns to Shakespeare the first
place among the English, both In tragedy
and comedy, but almost In the next
breath he ranks him with such dusty and
forgotten worthies as Dr. Legge of Cam
bridge and Dr. Edes of Oxford. Even his
fellow-players in their preface to "The
First Folio" spoke of Its masterpieces as
"trifles" presented to their noble patrons.
This, in fact, was the general verdict of
contemporary criticism In regard to all
dramatic productions. A play in those
day was meant for the stage, not for the
closet. There was a general laugh when
Ben Jonson In the very year of Shakes
peare's death publishd his plays under
the title of "Works." But Jonson. who
knew so well the value of hl3 own pro
ductions, was the only man of his age
to estimate Shakespeare at anything like
his proper worth. In the carelessness of
confidential conversation he might indeed
laugh at the shipwreck on the coast of
Bohemia, but when he came to express
his fixed and final judgment he struck an
other tone. In the famous lines prefixed
to "The First Folio" there Is no depreca
tory reference to "these trifles," no
ranking of Shakespeare even with
Chaucer or Spenser. He praises the art
that shaped the living line as well as the
nature that gave the matter. Not only,
he asserts, does Shakespeare's comedy
cast into the shade the wit of Arlsto
pliantes and Terence, but his sterner
notes summon from their graves the
great tragedians of the classic past to
hear a late-born rival challenge a com
parison of all sent forth by "Insolent
Greece or haughty Rome," and with an
even finer burst he turns to his country
and bids her know her son aright:
"Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an are. but for all tlmÂ»."
Shakespeare in the Age of the Besto
ration.
The civil wars and the closing of the
theaters opened a deep abyss between
the age of Shakespeare and that of the
Restoration. The theater reopened by the
returned Stuarts was no longer a na
tional institution. It depended for Its
very existence upon the favor of the
court; and the taste of the court was
French, demanding a rhetorical and de
clamatory tragedy and a comedy of
manners, where wit served as the apolo
gist of shameless debauchery. Shakes
peare, It is true, was by no means for
gotten. His plays were frequently per
formed upon the Restoration age. But
they were too often performed in strange
ly altered versions. Howard, for instance,
added a happy ending to â¢ "Romeo and
Juliet"; D'Avenant amalgamated "Meas
ure for Measure" and "Much Ado About
Nothing." Even Dryden took part In the
mutilation of Shakespeare, rewriting
"Troilus and Cressida," and turning "The
Tempest" Into a sort of opera, where
the verses of Shakespeare's loveliest
drama stray like lost sheep amid a
wilderness of Restoration rant and
ribaldry.
Yet Shakespeare's fame owes more to
Dryden than to any other English critic,
for it was Dryden who in the end vindi
cated the great poet of his nation against
the censures which a foreign school of
criticism cast upon htm. It is not. In
deed, easy to state exactly Dryden's es
timate of Shakespeare, for, though one of
our greatest critics, Dryden was no more
consistent in his critical judgments than
In his politics or his religion. But his in
consistency is explained In part by the
struggle In his own mind between an In
stinctive reverence for Shakespeare's
genius and a critical disapprobation of
certain Shakespearean peculiarities of
style and diction, In part also by a steady
development of his powers of literary
judgment. In his first critical essay he
unsparingly condemns Shakespeare's love
of puns and too frequent "bombast,"
while acknowledging that "of all modern
and, perhaps, all ancient poets, he had
the largest and most comprehensive
soul." He prefers the "wit." or as we
would say, "the genius," of Shakes
peare to the correctness of Ben Jonson,
at that time generally regarded as the
greatest, because the most "regular" of
English dramatists. He is troubled by
Shakespeare's "solecisms of speech and
notorious flaws of sense," and is es
pecially disturbed by his inequalities of
style. Little by little, bowerer, Dryden's
own labors In dramatic composition
taught him something of the exceeding
riches of Shakespeare. He became his
avowed disciple, and In the preface to his
first blank verse drama frankly con
fessed "In my style I Imitate the divine
Shakespeare â¢ â¢ â¢ and I hope I may
affirm that by imitating him I have sur
passed myself." He dwells with par
ticular admiration upon Shakespeare's
power of character drawing, due to the
"universal mind which comprehended all

Shakespeare as the national poet and In
sists that "our English reverence for him
is much more Just than that of the
Greeks for Aeschylus." Â¦â *. ,
Compared with Coleridge or Schlegel
Dryden's praise of Shakespeare may seem
hesitating and half-hearted. But we must
not leave out of account the critical tem
per of the age In which he lived. The at
titude of what may be called profession
al criticism in his time is represented,
though perhaps in an exaggerated form,
by Thomas Rymer, to whom "Othello"
was "none other than a bloody farce with
out salt or savor." and who summed up
his criticism of Shakespeare in the monu
mental utterance. "The truth is, this
author's head was full of villainous, un
natural Images."
Shakespeare and the Classical School
. of Criticism.
Dryden Is the father of the so-called
classical school of Shakesperean criticism,
a school which has been the mark for
bitter Invective by later eulogists of tho
poet, but which contributed none the less
to the growth of Shakespeare's fame. Its
greatest representatives. Pope and John
son, devoted years to the preparation of
revised and annotated editions of hli
works. In their prefaces they extolled his
genius in the highest terms, though rioi
without some measure of fault-findlnpr.
The chief tenet of this school is that
Shakespeare was a poet of vast genius
and profound insight into human nature,
but of equally unbounded extravagance
and irregularity of style.' "Wild, irregu
lar, lawless," are terms of 'frequent oc
currence in their criticisms. Pop*, to bo
sure, endeavored to clear Shakespeare*
rame by stigmatizing as interpolations of
tne player-editors whatever passages
seemed to him unworthy of Shakespeare's
sen *' w and Johnson elaborately vindi
cated him from the common critical
charge of violating the dramatic unities.
Yet the reader instinctively feels that
"'"f. PÂ°Pe nor Johnson was at home
with Shakespeare. It was not so much an
emotion of reverent awe as a sensation of
self-conscious uneasiness that came over
them at the contemplation of his work.
in two noble metaphors Pope compares
Shakespeare to an "ancient, majestic
piece of Gothic architecture." and Johnson
likens his work to a "forest of branching
oaks and towering pines, interspersed
sometimes with weeds and brambles,
sometimes giving shelter to myrtles and
roses. ' But the age of Pope and Johnson
vastly preferred the pseudo-classicism of
the late Renaissance to all "ancient and
majestic Gothic architecture." and tt*e
trimly cut parterres of their own gardens
to all the untended forests of the world.
One feels that Pope's mind dwelt rather
on the grinning monstrosity of the gar
goyles than on "the height, the space.' the
gloom, the glory," and Johnson's on the
weeds and brambles of "tumor, mean
ness, tediousness and obscurity," which
he discovered in the forest of Shakes
peare, rather than on the towering
strength of his Imagination or the fra
grant beauty of his verse.
Yet with all Its limitations, and in spite
of its curious habit of stroking with one
hand and striking with the other, th's
school has one great merit. It definitely
established the position of Shakespeare
as a classic, the greatest of English clas
sics. After Dryden's death the natural
predilection of English readers for the
great national poet was sanctioned and
defended against the assaults of crltfcaa
ters by the immense authority of thrve
successive chiefs of English letters, Addl
son. Pope and Johnson.
The School of Textual Criticism.
The greatest service rendered to Shakes
peare's fame by critics of the eighteenth
centur>*t however, was the restoration of
his text and the preparation of an ade
quate body of explanatory and illustrative
comment. During the seventeenth cen
tury only four editions of Shakespeare
had appeared, each of them full of gross
and manifest corruptions. It is almost
impossible for the student of Shakespeare
in the revised and corrected editions of
to-day to form any conception of the dif
ficulty under which readers of the Au
gustan age labored who had before them
only the ill-printed, misspelled and at
times utterly nonsensical text of the old
copies.
The first attempt at correction was
made by the dramatist Rowe. In 1703. He
made out lists of dramatis personae for all
the plays: he divided into acts and sctne3
such dramas as had formerly been print
ed in solid wholes, and he supplied exits
and entrances. In other words, he tried
to make the text as intelligible to the
reader as a stage performance would be
to the spectator. He unfortunately re
printed the most corrupt of the old folios,
and made no systematic revision of the
text, but he Improved the reading from
time to time by a number of happy con
jectures.
Rowe was followed In 1715 by Pope, who
promised great things in the way of a pur
ified and annotated text. But Pope was
constitutionally Incapable of what ne him
self styled the drudgery of an editor, and
the fashion in which he translated Homer
was an ominous warning of the way he
would edit Shakespeare. He took the
greatest liberties with the old text, strik
ing out whole passages that seemed to
him below the dignity of a poet, making
alterations upon no better authority than
his own opinion, and at times simply re
writing a phrase that seemed obscure.
And he cared far too little for the age In
which Shakespeare had lived to gather Il
lustrative mattp- from the treasury of
Elizabethan literature; often, in fact, his
explanatory notes display ignorance
rather than knowledge.
In consequence of these defects Pope 3
edition was a distinct disappointment, ami
a rival soon entered the field. This was
the work of Theobald, the "piddling Tio
bald" of the Dunciad. a writer of poor
plays and worse poems, but a critic of
the very highest order. He possessed a
fine ear for the rhythm of blank verse
and the keenest sense for the nuances of
language. To these qualifications he add
ed a vast store of learning in the classical
and modern tongues. He knew Eliza
bethan literature better than any other
man of his day. and 13 said to have read
over 800 old plays In preparation for his
edition. Morevoer. he was at once con
scientious and Indefatigable in the labor
of collation and transcription. His guid
ing principles, enunciated in a letter to
"VVarburton, remain to this day authori
tative canons for textual emendation.
"I ever labor," he says, "to make the
smallest deviation that T possibly can
from the text: never to alter at all where
I can by any means explain a passage Into
sense: nor ever by any emendations to
make the author better when it is prob
able that the text came from his own
S He 3 'restored from "The First Folio" a
number of true readings which had been
lost in later editions, and corrected many
corrupt and obscure passages by conjec
tures as happy as brilliant.* The most
familiar of these, of course. Is the emÂ«i
datlo certlssima. which has restored to us
the last words of Falstaff. In spite of
this abuse of Pope and the neglect of pro
fessed scholars. Theobald's work met
with an Immediate and gratifying suc
cess. Seven editions of it were published
within the next forty years, a remarkable
proof, by the way. of the growth of
Shakespeare's fame when compared wltn
the four editions which had satisfied the
demand In the preceding century.
Theobald's most scholarly successor
was undoubtedly Capell. who published
an edition of Shakespeare In 1768. Some
Inherent defect seems to have rendered
him incapable of expressing himself In
English of even ordinary intelligibility.
"He should have come to me." said John
son, patronizingly, "and I would have en
dowed his purposes with words, for as It
Is he doth gabble monstrously." But his
matter is excellent. The Cambridge edi
tors call his preface "by far the most
valuable contribution to Shakespearean
criticism that had yet appeared. And the
text that he offered to the public was
practically a new one. constructed by a
most careful and systematic collation of
all the old copies, and approaching far
nearer to the Ideal text of Shakespeara
than anything that had yet appeared.
Only one more name needs to be men
tioned In this connection, that of Jlalone.
He was by taste and temper a literary
antiquary rather than a critic. He was
an unwearied explorer of dusty records
and had access to manuscripts which
have since disappeared. Naturally, he
turned to Shakespeare's biography and to
the sources and chronology of his plays.
He made, for example, the first rational
attempt to determine the succession of
Shakespeare's dramas, and his research
es laid the foundation for much of the
subsequent knowledge that had been
gained along these lines.
In closing this topic a word must be
said of the Variorum editions of Shakes
peare, embracing the best notes of ail the
editors and supplying the student with
a complete apparatus crltlcus. These be
gan with Reed's reprint of the Steevens-
Johnson edition In ISO 3. and concluded
with the younger Boswell's edition In IS2I.
based upon Malone and Including a great
number of that scholar's manuscript
notes. The American Variorum of Dr.
Fumes Is too well known and highly
prized to need more than a mention.

asserted by the Democratic managers, to

Charged With Grand Larceny.
Detectives Ryan and ODea and Patroi
man Koegel last night charged Fred
Kamalade and Thomas Magulre, two
teamsters, with grand larceny at the City
Prison. On January 13, the detectives
say, a case of ladles' shoes was stolen
from Nolan's shoestore. and a week later
the goods were recovered from a store
at 120 Third street, where they had been
sold for $10 by Knmalade and Maguire.
The officers arrested Kamalade at Ms
home, 32 Gilbert street. Saturday night.
He claimed that he got the goods from
Magulre's home, at 49 Rltch street, and
sold them for him. Magulre was arrested
yesterday. He said he found the shoes
in the cellar of his house. It is thought
that the prisoners can be connected with
the many recent robberies at the railroad
freight sheds.

SPOKE AGAINST WARFARE.
Dr. Jordan on the Evils of Military
Conflict.
President David Starr Jordan was the
speaker of the evening at the meeting of
the Social Democrats last evening in the
Turk-street Temple.
His discourse, which was delivered un
der the title of "The Man That Was Left
Behind," was of a sociological character
and dealt with the evils to the manhood
of a nation resultant upon a great war. Dr.
Jordan said It was a well recognized fact
that nothing so tended to the debasement
of a nation as a great conflict which
drafted into the ranks of the military all
that was best, physically, morally and in
tellectually in a nation, for slaughter at
the front, leaving behind the weaklings
to breed the future generations for the
country.
"The Man That Was Left Behind" was
the name given to those who, for one
reason or another, were rejected by the
rigorous military examination, and the
speaker, in one of his characteristic lec
tures, showed the. national degeneration
that was bound to! result from a popula
tion sprung from such as these.
The major part of Dr. Jordan's address
was a plea for the abolition of war be
cause of the terrible results entailed on
the succeeding generations, though the
speaker also branched off, here and there,
into paths that led up to questions more
thoroughly economic in character.
At the conclusion of the lecture tho
meeting was thrown open to general dis
cussion, and a number of questions were
propounded. They were all ably answered
by Stanford's president.
LEGISLATORS WILL BE
SAFE IN LONDON
Judge Brown Says the Talk of Armed
Mountaineers Is Sheer
Nonsense.
LONDON*. Ky.. Feb. 4.â The rumors
that have become current that armed
mountaineers have gathered in London to
intimidate Democratic legislators are ab
solutely without foundation. The town 13
as peaceful and tranquil as any country
village. There are no armed men within
its limits, or lurking in the adjacent coun
try, so far as is known by the London
citizens.
Four Senators and nine Representatives
all Republicans, have arrived here
to-night. It is expected that the
morning train from Frankfort will brine:
in an influx of legislators. â¢
Judge W. L. Brown of the Circuit
Court said to-night: "Any man. no mat
ter what his politics, is as safe in London
as though he were in his own house.
There is nothing but emptiness to all these
rumors regarding armed intervention
from the mountaineers. We have but one
policeman, and he is the Town Marshal.
We do not need any more. Let the Legis
lature come here; there will be no trou
ble."
A signed statement, refuting the rumors
that London is armed to fight against the
Legislature, was written to-night by
Judge Brown and will be delivered by him
as a speech before the Laurel County Cir
cuit Court at the opening of Its regular
term to-morrow. The address in part
says: '
The papers of Northern and Eastern .cities
have vied with each other In their efforts to
slander our town and county, while some of our
own Kentucky papers have so far forgotten
thlr trust as to be a party to the slanderous at
tacks.
Among the infamous charges it has been said
that London Is the very mouth of hell; that It
is the center of the so-called feud district and
that the citizens of this county are a band of
outlaws, ready and anxious to pounce down on
the Legislature and tear It to pieces or upon
those members whose political affiliations dif
fer from the predominant party of the county.
I desire. In behalf of the people of my native
county, in behalf of the people whom I love
and among whom I was born and reared, to
denounce all of said charges as absolutely false.
In education. Industry and moral worth the
people of London will compare most favorably
with any city or town In Kentucky. The habit
has been formed outside of Kentucky of Judg
ing a State as a whole by the worst characters
to be found In the mountains oA In tho lower
classes of the cities. The world does not seem
to know that cultured Boston or metropolitan
New Tork would fare even worse by the selec
tion of such standards. I assert that in no
town is good order appreciated more fully and
In no county Is the law more vigorously ; en
forced than In London.
A legislative caucus will be held to-mor
row afternoon in the Circuit Court room.
In the morning the large number of legis
lators who are expected will spend their
time securing accommodations. There
are only three small hotels here.

MEDICINES CONVEYED
THROUGH THE SKIN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YOKIC. Feb. 4.â Recent experiments in this city have shown the pos-l
Fibillty of conveying medicines through the skin and into any portion of the
human body by placing them in the path of an electric current. Gout, rheuma
tism and consumption are now being treated by using electricity to convey
Cmz* to the affected parts, and, while no positive cures have been wrought,
results have been attained that seem to demonstrate the value of the new
treatment.
Dr. Samuel G. Tracy says: "Electricity was employed in 1559 by Richard
son in England to produce voltaic narcotism. Nothing practical came of ex
periments made at that time.
"Cataphoric action is purely a physical process. It may be illustrated by
an equal amount of liquid in two receptacles separated by a membrane and
parsing an electrical current through from one to another. The liquid will
flow through the membran** in the direction of the current, from the positive
toward the negative pole. Now. If a drug Is placed In n specially prepared
positive electrode, which is "held against any portion of the body, and a nega
tive electrode Is applied to anotoher portion of the body, medicine will be
driven through the skin and taken up by the blood vessels and fluids of the
body.
"Among the uses to which cataphoric action may be put Is local anes
thesia. Cocaine applied in this way will produce anesthesia in from five to ten
minutes. This application will relieve local pain, neuralgia, rheumatism and
sciatica.
"Consumption is treated by using a epeclally constructed positive elec
trode, which fits over the chest. The medicine applied to this Is carried to
the lungs, when the negative pole is placed at the back. Experiments are
now being made at St. Luke's Hospital for the cure of consumption in this
manner. Formaldehyde Is used, and the results are said to be very satisfac

An atempt to forcibly divest Adjutant

that you will accept my services as tem

sylvania. They will both be driven by
quadruple expansion engines, the total
Indicated horse-power of which will be
18,000. The cylinders of these engines will
each measure 35, DO, 70 and 100 inches in
diameter, by C6-inch stroke of piston. In
each ship there will be six double-ended
and two single-ended cylindrical Scotch
boilers, each 16 feet In diameter. Tha
working pressure will be 200 pounds to the
square inch. All modern accessories, such
as electric lighting plant. Ice-making ma
chine, steam steering gear, etc., will be
Included In the general outfit.
The first of the new steamers will be
called the California and she will be ready
for service about January next. The pio

God" as the text of his sermon. He told
of the gradual advance of St. Stephen's
Church and what it had accomplashed
since 1875. He said the regular work of
the church began in the latter year; thit
in the following year the money necessary
for the purchase of the present site was
raised, which amounted to over $5000. and
a building, now a portion of the parish,
was erected at a cost of 51750. By ISSI a
debt of $1500 was cleared and there was
enough money left in the fund to erect
the building which has ever since been
used for worship. In IS9I the old building
was rebuilt at a cost of $2700 and trans
formed into a parish building. During
Mr. Lion's rectorship 9C2 people have been
baptized, 337 confirmed, 431 marriages have
been celebrated and he conducted 872
burials. St. Stephen's stands fifth in the
order of parishes in Its donations to mis

RIVAL CLOAK
MAKERS CAUSE
A SMALL RIOT
Several Persons Hurt
in the Melee.
THREE MEN UNDER ARREST
BOTH SIDES CHARGED WITH
BEING AGGRESSORS.
Different Versions of the Cause of
the Trouble Given by Union
and Non-Union
i Â¦ Hen.
The union men who were) discharged
from the employ of Davidson & Miller,
the cloak firm engaged In business at 729
731 Market street, and the non-union men
now in the employ of the firm have come
to blows. A collision between the rival
workmen at Seventh and Mission streets
yesterday afternoon resulted in a small
sized riot, in consequence of which two
of the non-union men were treated at the
Receiving Hospital for lacerated wounds
on the forehead, while three of the union
cloakmakers were arrested on charges of
battery.
Word was sent to. the Southern police
station at about 4 o'clock that a big row
wasJn progress at Seventh and Mission
streets, and several policemen were driven
to the spot in the Datrol wagon. On their
arrival they found that two/non-union
employes of the firmâ H. Stecher of 643
Stevenson street and J. Farblsten of 61<*
Natoma streetâ had received wounds on
the forehead. They were sent to the Re
ceiving Hosuital for treatment. Both
claimed they had been struck by canes.
B. Farbisten had been struck on the face,
but was not injured sutllciently to require
medical attention.
M. Kosman, a union man, was arrested
and charged with battery for engaging in
fisticuffs with Stecher near Seventh and
Minna streets. T. Solomon and Max Her
man were afterward recognized among
these who followed the patrol wagon to
the hospital, as having taken part in the
melee, and they were arrested on similar
charges. All three were at once released
upon furnishing cash ball.
In discussing the matter last evening.
David M. Davidson said the trouble arose
three weeks ago over the firm employing
a non-union man and also a boy as an
apprentice. The men had not gone out
on strike, according to Mr. Davidson's
version, but had been discharged.
"We discharged eighteen men," he de
clared, "because the union attempted to
say whom we should employ. Their
places have been filled by twelve non
union employes. The union men were all
paid from 53 to J4 50 a day, and the only
thing that caused trouble was the union
interference. The union men have been
told they can return to work whenever
they cease to make the union a factor in
proceedings."
The union members who were arrested
claimed that their adversaries started the
trouble yesterday and that the union
could not justly be blamed for what fol
lowed. As regards the origin of the trou
ble, their version was that the firm had
broken certain promises and forced thÂ«
employes to take the action resulting in
their discharge.

Â»How Judges Barry and Cabaniss Were Saved From Gracec
CLARENCE TORRENCE, a colored bellboy, Is either a martyr to the
bench or a bigger prevaricator that was Munchauseru Clarence la
only a. bellboy and follows that active calling In a lodging-house on
Sutter street. Clarence has also developed a thirst for liquid refresh
ment that can only be satiated by large quantities Of cooling bever
ages. His thirst has often lead him Into trouble, but with that happy disposi
tion so peculiar to his race he has wriggled out of tight places by the use of
a glib tongue, backed up with an Imagination that is worthy of a better
cause.
Torrence was one of thirty-seven Individuals who, having partaken too .
freely of the flowing bowl, had been gathered under the protecting wing
of a benevolent policeman and transported to a dark and gloomy cell to
sleep off the effects of his nocturnal debauch. Along with thirty-six other
partly sobered men of all conditions of servitude the Inebriated colored man
loomed up before Judge Conlan yesterday morning to turn the Judge's Sab
bath dream Into a nightmare. The Judge was, therefore, not in the best
Btate of , mind, and ho took occasion to point out the error of the ways of
those who bowed their enlarged heads before him.
The Judge's state of mind was due In a great measure to the fact that
Sunday sessions of the Police Courts will hereafter be held for thÂ« benefit
of the "drunks" of Saturday night. Before the charter went Into effect ; it
was customary for the Saturday drunks to be discharged Sunday after hav
ing been twenty-four hours in -Jail. Under the new charter, however, every
one arrested, even on a "drunk" charge, must be tried, so to avoid keeping
the drunks in Jail from Saturday to Monday, the Police Judges have de
cided to follow a custom in vogue in the Eastâ a. Sunday session of the
court. The Judges will pass the turn around,, and Judge Conlan took the
llrst assignment.
Clarence had his swollen cranium tied up in a cooling bandage, and
when the court Inquired â¢ into his. case the colored boy, with a blush, told
his "Honah" how he fell while trying to sayÂ© Judges Barry and Cabaniss
from a like fate. He mumbled:
"Well, yo Honah, ah was at a pahty last night at Taylor and Turk
streets. A gemman : ln the Tnx Cullectoh's ufflce invited a few frens to sup
pah and ah was engaged as a waitah. Jedge Cabaniss and Jedge Barry
were there, yo*. Honah, and the boss told me. to look aftah them. Well, yo*
Honah, ah'se-proud to, say ah did it to their satisfaction. Â¦ They had a big â¢
thirst, yo' Honah, and they made me drink' moah than was good fore me.
An doan know how ah got this cut on ma head, but ah 'sDose ah must have
fallen."
"Well." said his Honor, "as you looked so well after the comfort of the
two Judges I will let you go, but be careful in the future if' you should'
have to look after them again."
Both Judge Cabaniss and, Justice of the Peace Barry -are noted * for
temperance, and Clarence Torrence had been stretching the truth. He was
found face downward on the sidewalk on Taylor street *near Turk, about 4
o'clock yesterday morning. by Policeman Joy and sent to the Receiving Hos-

"The Real Cause of War."
The Universal Brotherhood meeting
held In Academy of Sciences Hall last
evening was addressed by G. H. H
Somers on "The Real Cause of War "
The speaker said the first war occurred
In the individual and was between the
higher divine nature of man and his
lower or animal nature. The speaker
said the real warrior was the divine man
who waged conflict for the control of the
other. Continuing In the same strain
Mr. Somers delivered an exceedingly in
teresting discourse, which was practically
a plea for the divine In humanity.
Supposed Suicide.
Mrs. Celestine Portier, a wealthy widow
well known in the French colony in this
city, recently directed a communication
to P. A. Bergerot, her attorney, stating
that she had grown tired of life and
would kill herself. She has been reported
as missing by her friends to the Morgue
officials, but her body, if she be dead, has
not yet been recovered. About eight
months ago Mrs. Portler's husband, a
wealthy land-owner, died in this city.
The death preyed heavily on her mind
and since that time she has been subject
to spells of melancholy. Her health has
been poor for a number of years and at
one time she was an inmate of the
French Hospital. Her physical condition
contributed to her weakened mind and
her friends express the fear that she has
kept her threat and ended her existence.
In the letter Mrs. Portier stated that she
would drown herself.

TALKS OF ROBERTS CASE
In a Sermon .Declares That Congress

BALTIMORE, Feb. -4.â Cardinal Gibbons
preached to-day at high mass at the Ca
thedral, taking as his text, "What God
hath Joined together let no man put asun
der." Incidentally, he expressed in decid
ed terms his opinion regarding the Rob
erts case, saying:
"Respect for womanhood makes us ap
prove the refusal of the House of Repre
sentatives to allow Congressman Roberts
of Utah a seat among the nation's law
makers. As a Mormon he can have no
proper respect for women and he was
rightly and Justly rebuked.
"It was not a question of constitutional
rights or interpretation of the laws. His
constitutional rights have nothing to do
with the case, which resolves itself sim
ply into a question regarding the attitude
of the country toward the women of the
United States. In casting him out Con
gress paid a tribute to American woman
hood. To have allowed him to take his
seat would have been to countenance the
degradation of the holiest estate of man.
It was a victory for the right and Con
gress deserves credit for recognizing the
law which Is hieher than any other."

THE BACKSLIDING OF A
MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
Rev. E. Nelander of the First English
Lutheran Church last night preached on
"The Backsliding or a Minister of the
Gospel." In part he said:
In Acts xlli:U we learn of th* backsliding
of no lees a personage than John Mark, the
author of the second gospel. 'Whether It Â«Â»
homesickness, fear or a lack of sympathy with
the Pauline expedition Into Pamphylla is un
certain, but there was in any case a lack of
consecration. Who!eneartedneÂ«is Is taÂ» secret of
success in any enterprise. It is a sine qua
non In the ministry. It Is related of Alclbtades
that when a mere lad hÂ« was playing at dice
In a narrow street, when a chariot drew near.
Aldbtades disputed the road with the char
ioteer by casting himself prostrate. "Out of
my way!" cried the charioteer. "Drive on!"
answered the lad. No coachman drives over
anybody under those conditions; he alone Is in
danger who stands midway on the crossing,
divided betwixt two. But whether in boyish
play or In Christian service, more especially
In that of the ministry, the truth holds that
abandon means ultimate success. God asks
not ours, but ourselves, and he will have no
less. It Is a pleasure to learn from the sequel
that Mark outgrew Ma narrow-minded con
ception of the gospel. In the meantime he
did well to quietly step out of the ministry
until nÂ« was ready for a complete consecra
tion.
CAPTAIN HERBERT.
OAKLAND, "Feb. 4.â For ' the able
manner In which he handled his
vessel and brought ship and cargo
and crew out of danger, the men on
the Highland Light have presented Cap
tain Herbert with a gold watch.
The vessel encountered a terrific storm
Just after she left Oyster Harbor on her
last trip here, and for forty days the
ship battled with head seas and head
winds. Her rudder was broken and her
bowsprit had been carried away, and only
the cool Judgment and nautical skill of
her captain kept her from being driven
ashoro. Going on the rocks in such
weather would have meant the loss of
everything and every life aboard, and \it
is this the men wish to show they appre
ciate.
The Highland Light Is owned by George
E. Plummer & Co. of San Francisco. She
is now discharging her load of coal from
Oyster Harbor In Oakland Creek.

ANOTHER FARCE,
BUT A DULL ONE
fTv? SUCCESS in New York does not
// \\ always mean a success In San
J{~~h Francisco. "The Cuckoo" as pre
sented last night by the Frawleys
stands for the truth of this statement.
As a play it has no value whatever, and
It has barely enough humor to carry it
| through as a farce. It has none of that
! forgivable kind of nonsense which.
! linked with clever lines and amusing
i situations, will make such a flippant
J creation as "In Paradise" entertaining
> from beginning to end. The plot or
i scheme of the thing, on the contrary, is
i neither adroit nor original, and most of
{ the situations are positively inane. These
I facts, taken with the interminable tria
| logues, dialogues and monologues,
' couched in language that Is painfully un
: natural and rigged out with the tawdry
i tricks of ineffective verbosity, make "The
; Cuckoo" slow for the first two acts and
j tedious in the third.
I am sorry that Mr. Frawley has missed
I It so badly this season, for his efforts to
! please are undoubtedly sincere, but he
' has erred In judgment from the first, and
' I am afraid "The Cuckoo" Is another
â¢ eerious blunder. Its lack of entertaining
j qualities is more a reflection on the taste
!of New York, however, than on Mr.
: Frawley's Judgment, for he cannot be
. altogether blamed for staging a ' play
i with such a record of success.
The distribution is peculiar to say the
least, for none of the company seems to
i be happily cast except Mr. Armory, who
: usually contrives to make a good deal of
whatever part is assigned to him. Har
rington Reynolds is quite out of his ele
ment, and a number of small parts by
other members of the company are quite
unworthy of mention, either for their in
trinsic value or for the manner in which
they are handled.
Stockwell, who was especially engaged
for the part of Mr. Penfold. does not
give it any distinction whatever, and
Miss Van Buren recites her long, wordy
speeches, and indeed all her lines, as
though she were testing her memory. I
do not think uÂ»at any actress, however
accomplished, could make much of such
a role as that of Mrs. Penfold, for there
is really nothing to it but words, words,
words. If Miss Van Buren hopes to at
tain to eminence on the stage, and she
certainly has promise of It. she should
begin to be a little more careful of her
language. Unfortunately the stage in
America is not a "well of purest English,
undefined," but It Is always grateful to
find some few of its upper artists with
care for the graces of speech. Miss Van
Buren would do well to learn the proper
pronunciation of "toward" and "com
plaisant." and also the difference in
meaning between "comtemptuous" and
"contemptible." PORTER GARNETT.

It has been announced repeatedly that
James J. Hill has had his ambition con

that city on the Great Northern tracks,
and will, It is said, build Its freight sta

Wisconsin Central a few months ago be
came involved in trouble over Its Chicago
terminals, and that it finally arranged to
enter that city over the Illinois Central
tracks. The latter are also used by the

presenting "The Claims of Protestant Or
thodoxy on the Modern World." He said.
In part:
"I am not here to e-nter into controversy
with Gentile. Jew or Christian gentleman.
With the Jew we have no conflict, because
his theories are the foundation of our re
ligion; nor with the Catholics!. And when
Mr. Mills has the last shot on next Sun
day evening we will again realize that his
Christian character is due to Protestant
orthodoxy. The word Protestant covers
a vast ground. When we say Protestant
we think of Luther, who defied the Pope
end hurled his Inkstand at the devil.
When a man hurls epithets at John Cal
vin, remember there were needs of such
a man of Iron. He welded together the
magnificent architect of our religion.
Protestantism Is a growth, and there has
been Just as much change in Protestant
thought aa in anything else.
"Protestantism nas been a protest to in
fallibility, not a protest against true
Catholicism or the good priesthood and
the Christianity that is responsible to a
personal Christ. Orthodoxy means right
thinking. Protestant orthodoxy comes to
the world with an open Bible â not the
Bible chained to the pulpit. I believe the
Bible ehould be placed in the hands of
tvery one. with the Protestantism revi
sion. Protestantism that ie orthodox holds
the j>ioie as the medium from which the
rreat truth comes. Take that Bible and
U\e on it and tell us what it does for you.
Criticize it If you will, but live on it.
"The most intellectual thinkere of the
world are constantly studying the Bible
to find why, when and by whom the Bi
ble was written. Protestant orthodoxy
doea not persecute. The theory of evolu
tion even brings men nearer to God to
day than ever before. The three forms of
life in which God reveals himself in the
Bible U In the Son, the Father and the
Holy Ghost. It is a reasonable theory of
the Trinity that the orthodox church
holdsâ of God in Christ and Christ in
flesh. If you see God manifest you can
tee God transcendent.
'.'Protestant orthodoxy Is of one opin
ion on conversion. It admits of the be
ginning and forgets the past life. It rec
ognizes evolution, t-egeneracy, regenera
tion and heredity. It is as possible for a
human being to go down to the lowest
depths as it Is f or nim to rise a new crea
ture and live a life he could not live be
fore. . .
"I am aware there are many orthodox
Protestant* who would differ with me
on points of public meetings and conver
sion, but still fishing is best to catch
thoae best worth having; the hand-picked
fruit is better than any other.
"Protestant orthodoxy believes In an ed
ucated conscience. Let a man come to
God and a*k him what he was meant to
be, and then let him be that and not try
to be as some one else. We believe that
each man's conscience should be a guide
to himself. Woe be to the man who makes
a man depart from his conscience â that
Indwelling God."
Next Sunday night Rev. B. Fay Mills,
the Unitarian minister, will present "The

Coal. Sylvanus. In the latter he won
easily by a score of 6 to L In the previ
ous round he led Brutus, who then scored
a couple of turns and the kill. His course
with Carmendta was a short one, and
took but little out of him. Royal Flush
was made favorite at 2 to 1, and was
beaten by the close score of 7 to 6.
There wore several surprises In the first
round. Royal Union beat Rest Assured
at 1 to 2; Petronius beat Daisy Clair. 3 to

on Saturday. Forest King had a severe
course with Aeneas In the Â»*cond round,

THE CANADIAN MOODY.
Bey. William Meikle*, the Noted Bvan-
gelist, Is Hero.
The people of San Francisco little real
ize that there is in their city a man who
may well be called a "second Moody." He
Is the Rev. "William Meikle of Canada,
who >Is holding gospel meetings every
evening at the First United Presbyterian
Church, corner of Qolden Gate avenue
and Polk street
The Rev. Mr. Meikle is a larger man
physically than Mr. Moody was. He has
a heavier voice, a more philosophical cast
of mind, a more poetlcaf trend of thought
and as big and warm a heart. He knows
his Bible, and Is a close student of human
nature. He has had a wide experience
both as. pastor and evangelist. He Is a
graduate of Princeton, and for over twen
ty years has been preaching and holding
irreat revivals In Canada, Nova Scotia.
Ontario and In the Eastern States. He is
a strong preacher, and Is nor afraid to
preach the whole truth, but always does
it In a warm-hearted, sln-convlctlng. spul
stlrrlng way. without being sensational.
The Rev. Mr. Meikle will hold services
at the' First United Presbyterian Church
every Â¦ evening this week at 7:30 o'clock,
and will hold Bible readings, at the same
place each afternoon at 2:30. ..

Professionals Gladly
Lent Aid.
George B. Lask and Charles Bryant,
stage managers of the Tlvoll and Alcazar
play houses, yesterday proved themselves
adepts In their chosen field. It was due
to their skill that the large audience
which attended the eighth annual benefit
of Ban Francisco Lodge No. ZL, Theatri
cal Mechanics' Association, held . in the
Columbia Theater yesterday afternoon,
was able to enjoy a varied programme of
comedy, pathos, singing, dancing and. In
fact, a bit of everything seen on the stage
to-day. For over three hours the profes
sional people now entertaining the publio
lent their services in the cause of the
"men behind the scenes." That the ef
forts of those who took part were appre
ciated was evidenced, by the hearty ap
plause each number received.
Liouis James, the eminent actor, opened
the performance with well chosen words,
in which he thanked the people for their
presence and paid a tribute to the men
who mai.e possible the success of those
wno appear before the footlights. He
said the theatrical mechanics were the
architects, builders and painters of 'the
stage, and upon their ingenuity and ap
plication depended the success of the per
formance; and that the actor was the
sculptor and orator who deported himself
In tne painted creations of the builders
and the architects.
At the conclusion of his address the cur
tain arose on the second act of "In Para
dise." Miss Van Buren and the other
members [of the Frawley company ex
celled themselves in the bright comedy
and were repaid with generous applause.
Major Mite came all the way from the
Chutes to sing a Hebrew song and do a
Cakewalk, and Joseph Newman of the
Orpheum sang a number of his original
humorous songs. Winifred Ooff.who was
in magnificent voice, ably, represented the
Grand Opera-house, A i one-act sketch
from "Nature," by Collin Kemper, enti
tled "Don " was produced -by Norman
Hackett; Miss Grace Field. Alaster Jack
Robertson, Miss Maggie Francis Leavey
and Miss Helen Merrill. The story of the
play was woven around a small boy who
was ahero-worsniper, and who became
infatuated with his brother's best girl.
The Tivoll - Opera-house -was ;. generous
in Its. display of talent. A grand concert
was given, In which Miss, Francis Tem
pest-Graham, sang a -selection from
r'FauBr 'Fau8t ' Â¦ Tom Greene rendered .the "Holy
City," Julie Cotte sang an aria, Mlbs Ida
Wyatt did a coon song and dance, and the
only "Teddy" Hcrtmann rendered one of
his Inimitable songs." "
, Signorina Lya Pollettlnl and Slgnor
Antonio Vargas of;. the Oberon sang, as
did also Irene Franklin of the Orpheum;
Gladys Weller did a song and dance.
Fred and Amy Gottlobs appeared in their
original skit entitled "The Orphan Child";
Carleton and Royce of the Olympia sang,
danced and turned; and Professor J.
Warren Keane did a clever turn in leger
demain. He. was assisted by Mile. Ca
rita. The programme concluded with a
grand march and cakewalk from "Bo-
Peep," by the Tlvoll Opera-house chorus,
under the direction of Miss Ida "Wyatt.
The "success of the : entertainment was

Views of Brltton, dement, Menzies,
Barry and Gutte Bring Him to *
a Sealizing Senre of,
Monday Is here. Notwithstanding the
fact that Mayor Phelan caused It to be
announced last Tuesday that before this
date he would have ousted Police Com
missioner Biggy, that official is still in the
harness and still acting as Chief of Police
of Ban Francisco.
Mayor Phe.lan"s failure to keep hia word
in this instance is only a repetition of his
tory. As a rule he has been noted for
willfully breaking that ephemeral thing,
and even when he has tried to live up to
a promise perverse fate has stepped In to
prevent. In consequence, through ore
cause or another, the. little toy Mayor has
never been able to keeep his word.
It Is surmised that his Intention was
fixed in this last case and that he would
attempt to live up to the text of his de
cree to the Police Board that Biggy was
doomed before ' to-day. He has failed
miserably, apparently because he has seen
the handwriting in The Call of men who
were once his friends, now estranged from
him by his irrational action since be bar
gained to deliver the city over to the gang
of conspirators, whose first aim is to elect
Esola, alias Harrington, Chief of Polico.
The public utterances of Joseph N. Brit
ton, Henry N. Clement, Stewart Menzles,
Ifiidor Gutte and James H. Barry must
have cut the little Mayor like whips.
Without reservation they told him that
he was doing wrong; that in trying to
force the foul fruits of conspiracy on the
people he was acting the part of an in
grate and a traitor, and that he must
break away, once and for all ,^ from vile
associations or they would never call him
friend.
The feeling of Messrs. Brltton, Clement,
Menzles Gutte and Barry is well under
stood. The people know that before the
Mayor sold his political soul they were
his stanch supporters. It is certain that
they have turned their backs on him ouly
because he is a wrongdoer. .
Their words evidently have eaten deeply
Into the soul of Mr. Phelan. They have
shown him what his reason had failed to
show him beforeâ that he was going
against a stone wall of public opinion. He
has stopped at the last moment rather
than dash out his last spoonful of polit
ical brain. Any number of similar ex
pressions of opinion* have been heard try
The Call, and one of them follows. It la
an Interview with Edward R. Taylor, one
of the latest freeholders:
"I consider the Police Commission
squabble over tnÂ«Â» selection of a Chief of
Police," says Mr. Taylor, "to be an unfor
tunate affair in connection with the In
auguration of the new charter. It had
one merit, however, for it demonstrated
beyond a doubt that Esola should not be
appointed to the position over which ail
the controversy nas arisen. I certainly
would not vote for him If I were on the
commission, because I do not consider him
a- fit person to be at the head of a de
partment which requires a man or force
and character.
"It has been reported, with how much
truth I cannot say. that Mayor Phelan
had eald that If Esola were appointed
Chief and proved unfit ha (the Mayor)
would remove him. for the remedy lay In
his hands. Now, if his Honor said that
he Is assuming a prerogative which Is not
accorded to him by the charter. He has
no right to remove the Chief of Police.
That power lies wholly with the Board of
Police Commissioners, who are clothed
with the power to appoint. The power of
removal of subordinates does not He with
the Mayor. It would be an intolerable sit
uation to have the Mayor remove
subordinates. His power In that respect
Is confined solely to the members of the
variouj boards or commissions, and then
only for cause. The charter was never
Intended to give him wholesale powers of
removal. The distinction therein Is clear
between the heads of departments and
subordinates selected by them. ;â¢; â¢
"I know nothing ot any compact be
tween the Mayor and certain members of
the Police Commission before they re
ceived their appointment In regard to the
selection of any one candidate for Chief
of Police, but I would say that any man
who was a party to snch an Infamous un
derstanding Is not fit to hold any import
ant office. He would not be a man who
would act according to the dictates of the
one who appointed him to the place.
"We cannot have good government es
Intended by the charter unless the men
who fill the public offices discharge their
duties absolutely free from dictation of
any sort. The appointing power should
be the last In the world to dictate to them
or to attempt to abate one Jot or tittle
from the Independence which should char
terlze the true American citizen.
MAN NAMED COOK HEARD THREE SHOTS.
LATE last nlgrht thÂ» police secured a new clew In the case, which may solve the
mystery of the pistol If not the mystery of the casÂ« itself.
It has In some way been made known that on the night the Murphy girl died
a man named Cook claims to have been Bitting on a bench near where the
cirl's body was found, when he heard three shots. . "Another suicide" was the first t
thought that came Into his mind, and as he wu preparing to Investigate he heard-foot
step! of some one running down the path toward him. A moment after three- boys ap
peared, one of "them with his hand under his coat, as If carrying something concealed
there. The oldest ot the three seemed to be no more than 14 years old.
When they saw Cook, he says, they stooped short and stood ! for a moment, as If
embarrassed: then the other two grabbed the one with his hand under his coat by the
arms and dragged him on down the path and out of alcht. Â¦
It Is believed that these boys must have been In the vicinity when the girl waa shot.
and that seeing a chance to secure a pistol they grabbed the one she had used and ran
oft with, It.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1900.
AMY MURPHY'S DEATH
IS STILL A MYSTERY
Another Clew That May Throw Some Light
on the Dark Tragedy.
Poulin Taken to the Park by the Officers-Army
Surgeons Will Examine the Body Once
More This Afternoon.
MYSTERY still dings about the
tragic death of Amy Murphy, the
joung girl whose lifeless body
was found lying In the park on
Friday morning. Though a gen
eral belief of suicide exists among
those who have Investigated the case, the
possibility that a murder, was committed
has not been swept aside. The strange
disappearance of tne revolver from which
the bullet found in the girl's head waa
J.jed is ttill & deeply puzzling feature of
the case, and until this disappearance has
been explained the suicide theory cannot
be finally and completely accepted.
Horace Poulin, tne man for whom the 1
girl ended her life. if. indeed, she did com
mit suicide, saw yesterday the spot where
the death took place. He was taken there
by Detectives Cody and Dillon. Later in
tne Cay Detectives Wren and Dinan, to
whom had been given the detail of finding.
If possible, w-here the girl had pawned her
watch and where she had bought a re
volver, II Indeed she had done either of
these things, surveyed the field. They were
Inclined to the suicide- theory- Detective
Wren said it was nothing remarkable for
a person committing suicide with a re
volver to throw the weapon several feet
when falling. He said ne believed the
pistol might yet be found somewhere in
the vicinity. After the thorough search
that has been made, however, this seems
Impossible.
Morbid people In plenty visited the spot
yesterday. It Is reached by going down
the Hayes street walk and turning Into
the shrubbery at the big eucalyptus tree
that stands on the left just beyond the
peacock walk, the first one turning to the
left. It has been said that the body could
not have beÂ«n seen from any of the thor
oughfares, but this is a mistake, as it
could easily have been seen from the pes
cock walk. The girl's head was lying un
der a pruned shrub, and may have struck
some of the projecting points, but no hair 1
or blood was found on any of them. The
cnzloalty seekers who visited the place
yesterday beat the surrounding shrubbery
for the pistol, but found nothing.
The statement that a ghoulish thltf
would not have taken the watch and pis
tol and left the purse containing monay
ie answered by trie fact that this puise
was buttoned tightly Inside the girl's jack
et, and that the thief, if one there was.
either would not take the time to unbutton
the jacket or was not ghoul enough to
eearch the body. There was plenty of time
from the hour the death occurred until
the finding of the remains for thieves to
rob the dead.
All sons of fairy tales about shots hav
ing been heard, about couples resembling
Poulin and iliss Murphy being seen to
gether at the park and so on were In cir
culation out that way yesterday. One
little girl, the daughter of Mr. Price, liv
ing on Grove street, near Stanyan, and
' employed by \\ aterhouse & Lester, was
reported as having declared she had seen
a man shoot Miss Murphy. Little Miss
Price when questioned said she had only
seen the desu body when surrounded by
people and that this was all she had
epoken of.
Acting Chief of Police Blggy takes a
deep interest in the affair and is giving it
his personal attention. In company with
Commissioner Newhall he drove to the
park yesterday for purposes of personal
investigation.
From the nature of the wound In the
dead girl's head and the larger cartridges
in # the box found where she was lying. It
Is thought the revolver with which she
was kmed was one of the large sized bull
d'Jirs. 'j. iie.se jj^tols can be bought very
cheaply, and they .are capable of inflicting
a terrible wound at close range.
Poulin was practically in charge of the
detectives rr.ost of yesterday afternoon.
Upon his return from the park he was
taken by Diiion to McAvoy's undertaking
parlors, 1235 Market street, to look at the
body of tlie dead prirl. Several young
women friends of Mi?s Murphy were In
the place at the time, and Poulin became
very nervous in their presence. He had
to submit to their gaze while Dillon was
filling In a number of subpenas for the In
quest. He seemed g!ad when he left the
place.
The remains of the dead girl were taken
to McAvoy's yesterday morning, that un
dertaker obtaining them upon tne strength
Ot a t*MÂ«>gra;:;:ic order sent by the father
from Seattle. Mrs. Dart, mother of the
doad &r\, called at the undertaker's dur
1nÂ«" the day. and s.-iid Mr. Murphy had
had the telegram sent in response to one
pent him by her, asking him to arrange
for the burial of their dead child.
The funeral will take place from the
undertaker's Tuesday morning at 10
o'clock. It would have been held to-day
but for the fact that Coroner Cole wants a
further investigation of the wound made.
Dr. Cole is by no means satisfied that
there Is but one wound, and he Is going to
take stops to set his mind at rest on that
point if possible. He has made arrange
ments to have some surpeons supposed to
ht* experts in the matter of gunshot
wounds make an examination this after
noon at 4 o'clock. One of these Is Dr.
Brigham and the other Dr. Goodfellow,
end a third is Dr. Middleton. Dr. Brlg
hara was an army surgeon, and Dr. Good
fellow 1s at present In the army.
Mr. McAvoy says an injustice has been
done the dead sirl by the statement that
the was committed to the Magdalen Asy-
