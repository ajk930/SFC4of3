GERMANY'S NEUTRALITY.
BERLIN, Feb. 2tÂ».â The Foreign Office
witnesses with solicitude the growing
anti-German sentiment in Great Britain.
The truth Is that Germany, since the
outbreak of the war in South Africa, has
maintained the strictest neutrality. No
responsible German statesman or official
has hitherto expressed antiphobe senti
ments.
It may also bo asserted positively that
Emperor William has on several occa
sions spoken in a spirit of decided friend
liness toward Britain. True, the German
press Is inclined to be anti-Britain, aa
are also the masses of the people, but the
Foreign Office points out this is a spon
taneous outburst for which the German
Government cannot be held responsible.
The Foreign Office denies that there Is
any justification for the statement in
Parliament of Wm. St_ John Broderick,.
British Under Secretary of State for For

that Germany harbprs schemes against

PURSUIT OF THE
RETREATING BOERS
LONDON. Feb. 21.â A correspondent of
%he Dally Chronicle, telegraphing Sunday,
thus describes General Cronje's retreat
"with the Boors at Magorsfonteln on learn
ing of General French's success:
"On Thursday at midnight, headed by
General Cronje. 6000 Boers, with their
h<?avy guns and ox wagons, evacuated the
Magersfontein lines. At dawn on Friday
the retreating Boer army was seen from
the British naval gun, stationed on Klip
Drift Kopje, trekking eastward across the
British front at a distance of five thou
sand yards. Our guns opened upon them
snd a force of mounted infantry, crossing
the river, made a dashing charge In the
attempt to cut off the head of the enemy's
column. But In half an hour their whole
Â¦force had gained shelter under of a line
cf kopjes.
"Meanwhile two of our batteries had
come up and the Oxfords, Buffs, West
Hidings and Glouoesters. Our Infantry
crossed the drift and for thr^e hours were
engaged with the enemy, while our bat
teries shelled his position. The mounted
infantry kept hard at work.
"Unable to withstand our galling flre,
the enemy retired, disputing every Inch
and took up a second position on the
kopjes to the eastward. It was* a mag
nificent spectacle to pee the Boer army
thus at bay. Their rear gunrd, 2000 strong,
fought us, while the main body trekked
further cart and then brought their guns
Into action while the roar Kuard retired.
"The action lasted throughout the day.
Our infantry fought pplendldly, but the
enemy . held his ground under the con
tinued bombardment Later on the Boer
commander ventured on a bold stroke.
Reaving 2000 of his men under cover he
withdrew the rest from his main position
ar.d headed for Klip Kraal Drift, six
Ciiles to the east.
"This movement was soon discovered.
Our mounted Infantry came back across
the drift and marched along the south
bank to endeavor to head off the enemy.
When they reached the neighborhood of
Klip Kraal Drift night had fallen and
the Boers were already across to the
south side. Our mounted Infantry harass
ed their movements. BRW
"Meanwhile the Boer rear guard, hav
ing covered the crossing cf the main body,
retired slowly and successfully passed the
drift. The rear guard fousfht desperately
and as it fell back to the river It was
harassed on the flank and rear by the
British.
"Having thus passed the Kodder under
cover of darkness, the Boirs trekked
through the night In the d'rectlon of
Bloemfontein. General Kelly-K?nny. with
the Sixth Division, pursued then at day
light. General Mac Donald, with '.he High
landers, following him. General Mac Do
nald reached Klip Kraal Drift b/ forced
marches Sunday. General Kelly-Kenny,
moving from Klip Kraal Drift, was en
deavoring to outflank the enemy a.nd to
cut them off from Bloemfontein, so as to
drive them back into General Mac Do
nald's hands. When I left the front Gen

the enemy."
RELIEF OF KIMBERLEY
BY FRENCH'S FORCE
MODDBR RIVER, Feb. 19. -Although thÂ»
rapid march of General French's division
was marked by a number of conflicts the
entry to Kimberley was unopposed. When
the British were still eight miles off the
signaling corps Intercepted a heliograph
message from the beleaguered garrison
to Modder River, saying:
"The Boers are shelling the town."
The advance column replied; "This Is
General French coming to the relief of
Kimberley."
The garrison was Incredulous and
thoupnt the message was a Boer ruse and
flashed the query. "What regiment are
you?**
The reply satisfled the defenders of
T ONDON, Feb. 21.â With 40,000 British troops in hot pursuit of Cronje, or already surrounding
Jj him, Lord Roberts' campaign in the Free State has thus early reached a critical point, and
England is waiting the issue with marked impatience.
Up to 2 o'clock this morning the War Office had issued no bulletin concerning the momen
tous operations between Kimberley and Bloemfontein other than an unimportant one, showing
that the commander-in-chief's headquarters has been established at Paardeberg, thirty miles east
of Jacobsdal, close to the main road to the Free State capital, from which it is forty miles distant.
Nor had any dispatches come through to the newspapers from the scene of war. Lord Kitchener,
who is in command of the pursuing army, has with him all of French's cavalry, the sixth, seventh
and ninth divisions, and Mac Donald's Highland brigade.
Cronje has probably with him, besides his original force of 10,000, 8000 invaders of Cape
Colony, some of whom were in the command that fought Clements at Colesberg, while others
were at Stormberg. According to some authorities the Free Staters, who are moving from Colenso
and Ladysmith, will add 10,000 more to Cronje's ranks, if indeed they are able to join him.
Under the circumstances it is a great mistake to imagine that the Boer resistance has col
lapsed. If foreign experts with the Boers are listened to, and Cronje succeeds in making his es
cape, Bloemfontein will be evacuated and battle wilt be offered the British army in the hills before
Windburg.
In Natal General Buller's troops are still pressing forward. General Hart's brigade yester
day took possession of Colenso, and at last reports was crossing the Tugela at that point. This
advance guard is fourteen miles by road from Ladysmith.
Apparently the remainder of the army of relief will soon be across the river. The Boers
have thus far not shown themselves in any strength, and the invasion of the Free State by Roberts
has evidently drawn away a large number of men. The chances of the early relief of Whjte's
forces in Ladysmith seem to be good, but burghers have shown slimness on many previous occa
sions, and may be in strong position a few miles north of the river. Some more sanguine ob
servers say, however, that it would not be surprising if they removed their guns and > abandoned
the siege and fell back to the northern border of Natal. As far as dealing another blow at British
prestige, the capture of Ladysmith would not be of great material benefit to the Boers.

OF TARIFF BILL
House Republicans Are
; Alarmed.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â Again to-day
there were but three speeches ln the
House upon the Porto Rlcan tariff bill.
Five hours were consumed In their deliv

of the bill, and Newlands of Nevada and
Swanson of Virginia in opposition to it.
The. speakers devoted themselves almost
exclusively to the constitutional question
involved .and were listened to with atten
tion. .
The Republican leaders are becoming
nervous over the fate of the bill. They
have a majority of only fourteen over the
opposition, which Is solidly opposed to the
measure. Eight votes from the Repub
lican side would, therefore, defeat it, and
there are from thirteen to fifteen Repub
lican votes in doubt. A movement for a
Republican caucus Is being agitated, and,
although no call had been Issued
up to the time 'of adjournment to
night, the general understanding was
that one would be held to-morrow night.

the bill are McCall of Massachusetts, Lit

FRANCISCO SHIPPING
Piotcsts Against the Proposed Order
Making- Nome a Sub-Port Â¦ )*.':
"qf Entry.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 20.-Senator Per
kins has received numerous telegrams
from owners of vessels on the Pacllic
Coast protesting against the intention of
the Treasury Department to make Cape
Nome a sub-port of entry. Many of the
ship owners point" out the advantages that
vessels plying from Victoria and Vancou
ver would enjoy over those from ports of
the United States if the proposed change
were made. American, ship- owners- agree
in urging Senator Perkins to impress upon
Secretary Gage the necessity of rescind
ing the order already made and thus, by
continuing the present conditions of af
fairs ln Alaska, compel British vessels to
discharge their cargoes at St. Michael or
at Dutch Harbor. The attention of the
American ship owners to the losses which
they will suffer by making Cape Nome a
sub-port of entry was attracted by the
advertisement of shippers in British Co
lumbia offering to carry passengers and
freight to Cape Nome and guarantee ship
pers as well as passengers against deten
tion and delay from Custom-house of
ficials.
Senator Perkins is in entire accord with
the protests of his correspondents.
"I shall lay the matter before the Treas
ury Department to-mcrrow," said he. "I
cannot believe that the Secretary thor
oughly understands the situation. Section
2771, Revised Statutes, reads:
Vessels which are not vessels of the United
States shall be uermltted to unload only at
portÃ of entry established by law, and no such
vessels shall be admitted to make entry In any
other djÃtrlct than In the one In which she
shall be permitted to unload.
The Secretary of the Treasury has the
power to designate sub-ports, in Alaska.
At present Cape .Nome is not a sub-port
and in consequence no foreign vessel may
enter there. The nearest port is St.
Michael. As matters now stand, on ac
count of the convenience of making the
through trip, . practically all the traffic
for Cape Nome would be carried in Amer
ican vessels from San Francisco, although
It is possible that British shippers might
attempt to repeat their efforts in the
days when Juneau was the nearest port to
Dyea and Skaguay. At that time on sev
eral occasions they were j permitted to
take on board at their own expense
deputy collectors of the United States to
accompany them. This might possibly
be done at Dutch Harbor or St. Michael
if Cape Nome should not bo made a sub
port.

ings to-day reported favorably Senator
Foster's bill appropriating $750,000 for a

SAN JOSE, Feb. 20.â Mrs., Petrovello
Segunda, aged 104 years, died lnthis city
yesterday of appendicitis. She was the
oldest person in 'the county; 'Mrs. Se
gunda was a native of California and was

LONDON. Feb. 20.â The House of
Commons to-day was crowded when
Mr. David Alfred Thomas, Liberal,
moved the reopening of the inquiry
Into the Jameson raid. Among
thoee ln the diplomatic gallery was the
United States Embassador, Joseph H.
Choate. ;'*v
Mr. Thomas disclaimed any personal
animosity against Mr. Chamberlain, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, but
said the Inconclusive nature of the first
Inquiry had created widespread dissatis
faction, which had deepened the indigna
tion at the disclosures of the continental
newspapers impugning the impartiality
of the committee. He said it was ln the
interest of the nation, of the character
and reputation of the House of Commons
and of Mr. Chamberlain that there should
be a full and searching inquiry.
Mr. Thomas further asserted that the
previous inquiry was a farce and that
the fresh facts adduced ln the corre-'
spondence published in the Independenz
Beige were strong grounds for a fresh
inquiry.
Samuel Thomas Evans. Liberal,
seconded the motion. In so doing he
agreed that there were strong grounds
for suspecting that the Colonial Office
and Mr. Chamberlain had prior knowl
edge of the events leading to the raid.
Power of the Authors.
Continuing. Mr. Evans said it was a
question whether the authors of the raid
had sufficient power or influence to pre
vent a majority of the House of Com
mons from having the opportunity of get
ting a committee of Inquiry appointed.
Here Mr. Chamberlain interjected: "I
do not understand what the member
means by the last sentence."
Mr. Evans replied that he thought
every one else in the House understood
the suggestion was that there were influ
ences which might be worked to prevent
the Government from asking for the re
. appointment of a committee. Ministerial
cries of "What influences?" followed this
remark-
Mr. Evans, proceeding, said that If the
Investigations of the committee had been
more exhaustive it might have arrived at
a different conclusion. The conduct of
Mr. Chamberlain previous to the 'inquiry,
according to the speaker, aroused sus
picions of complicity and ought to be ex
plained, as ought also Mr. Chamberlain's
extraordinary declaration after the in
quiry that Mr. Rhodes' personal honor
was not affected." He also said that a
letter since published showed that there
was something to withhold.
Chamberlain Explains.
Mr. Chamberlain, amid profound atten
tion, said there was absolutely nothing in
what haul happened since 1857 which should
be raised as ground for a second inquiry.
He then proceeded to review the whole
history of the matter and repeated his
previous declaration ?-specially referring
to the Hawkesiey telegrams.
Mr. Chamberlain ridiculed the grounds
ad\'anctd for a new inquiry and explained
that Mr. Rhodes was charged with two
distinct offenses. Hi* was accused first,
of conspiring to bring about the raid, on
which he was found guilty and condemned
ln the strongest terms by the committee.
The Colonial Secretary blamed him as se
verely as anybody. ThÂ« other charge waa
that he had acted from sordid motives,
with the object of promoting speculation
dni raising the value of his property. This
was an abominable chatge, which should
pot have been made, and of which Mr.
Rhodes was absolutely guiltless. Another
ground upon which an inquiry was asked
was on account of the "precious collection
of documents" published by the Indepen
denz Belpe. offered for sale to various
London papers. The Boers contrived to
transmit them to Dr. Leyds, who paid or
promised to pay Â£100, and they were then
communicated to the Independent Beige.
"There is nothing* in these documents
from tirst to last," paid the Colonial Sec
retary, who dissected most of the docu
ments, pointing out that they afforded no
ground for charge* against the Colonial
Office. He then said:
"If this matter had not been compli
cated by political matters and personal
when it is necessary that the nation
should work in harmony."
The House of Lords rejected the motion
of Lord Wemyss by a vote of 69 to 42.
animosities no man in this house would
have said there was a shadow of ground
for such an inquiry. The object ot these
personal attacks Is to prevent me from
participating in the Transvaal settle
ment."
Letters Stolen and Sold.
Mr. Chamberlain further declared, as to
the telegrams excuanged between Mr.
Rhodes and his agent, that they were sent
confidentially ana he returned them, say
ing he had no objection to their publica
tion. Since June 6, IS&6, he had not seen
the telegrams, which were produced and
examined by the committee. As to the
letters Mr. Chamberlain said they were
stolen from Mr. Hawksley's desk and Dr.
Leyds ottered to pay Â£100 for them. They
contained nothing unknown to the com
mittee.
Mr. Chamberlain confessed that at one
time he felt bitterly against such insinu
ations, which "those repeating them did
not dare to assert they believed should
be brought against me after twenty-four
years' membership in .the House of Com
mons."
Continuing, he said he was not hopeful
that anything he or the House coulu say
would silence his foreign critics, but no
one in Great Britain for whose good opin
ion he cared would be affected by the
charges. The manner of conducting the
business of the committee and the clos
ing of tne Inquiry', he declared, were both
carried out as suggested by Sir William
Vernon Harcourt, who certainly did not
desire to shield any one in the Colonial
Office.
Mr. Chamberlain further said that the
honorable members opposite did not want
an inquiry. "They want an execution,"
he added. "Let them do their worst. I
am perfectly ready. I rely upon the good
sense and generosity of the House and
country. The attack, will recoil upon
those who made it."
At the conclusion of his remarks Mr.
Chamberlain was heartily cheered by the
Ministerialists.
Harcourt's Arraignment.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt, who was
an active member of the Parliamentary
committee which inquired into the Jame
son raid, followed. Sir William 1 said:
"On the very face of it the former com
mittee's report did not find that there had
been a full inquiry, as Indeed there had
not been. The suspicions against the
Colonial Office were not the work of
political adversaries, or rather of men,
who. for their own objects, stuck at
nothing in the way of mendacity, for
gery and fraud. The authors of those
suspicions were the agonts of Cecil
Rhodes. To cover their own guilt they
sought to assert the complicity of the
Colonial Office. Dr. Jameson told Sir
John Willoughby, a man of unquestioned
honor, that the Government was behind
the raid, and Dr. Jameson has not de
nied it."
Mr. Chamberlain â "Yes, he has."
Sir William Vernon Harcourt continued:.
"The insurrection was promoted by the
foulest frauds. Was there ever any
thing so abominable as the Rhodes tele
gram to Jameson, two days before the
raid, putting ln his mouth the lie about
the objects of the raid? When rtie
Colonial Secretary, after the raid, asked
for an inspection of the telegrams,
Hawk.<Â»ley wrote back that this was un
necessary, as the Colonial Secretary knew
all. Therefore suspicions were set afloat
by the agents of Rhodes, but then there
was no suggestion that they were covered
by the complicity of the Colonial Office.
That is what I want to huve shown up.
I want the transactions of these men
brought to light. Rhodes has deceived
everybody. .The raid was made by gold
and lies.*
The House rejected themotion to reopen
the Inquiry by a vote of 2SC against 152.
LORDS REJECT THE
MILITIA BALLOT SCHEME
LONDON. Feb. 20.â 1n the House of
Lords during the discussion of the motion
of the Earl of .Wemyss favoring an
amended militia ballot act Lord Lans
downe, Secretary of State for War, said
he thought it would be inexpedient to
have recourse to the militia ballot except
in the case of complete failure of the vol
untary system.
The Duke of Devonshire, Lord President
of the Council, expressed similar opinions,
adding that the present emergency did not
call for the "recent hysterical appeals" of
Lord Rosebery nor for a mobilization of
the fleet.
The Earl of Klmberley supported the
contention of Lord Lansdowne. Lord
Rosebery, Lord Dunraven and Lord
Northbrook, with others, supported the
appeal of Lord Werayss.
The Marquis of Salisbury opposed the
motion. He raid there will be not the
slightest chance of passing such a bill
without angry and acrimonious debate
and without a public discussion of those
dangers to which Lord Rosebery thought
the country exposed. He asked if the
House thought that would be advan
tageous.
"Suppose the bill were to pass," said the
Premier, "and the ballot were to prove
unsuccessful. It would give- abroad an
impression of defenselessness, thus adiling

THE WHOLE SECRET'
Of the Remarkable Success of a
Bemedy for Indigestion and ..
Stomach Trouble.
A new remedy which may revolutionize
the treatment of stomach troubles has
been placed before the public and bears
tne endorsement of many leading physi-
cians and scientific men.
This preparation 13 not a wonderful dis-
covery nor yet a secret patent medicine,
neither Is It claimed to cure anything ex-
cept dyspepsia, indigestion and stomach
troubles, with which nine-tenths of our
nation are more or less affected.
The remedy Is in the form of pleasant-
tasting tablets or lozenge* containing
vegetable and fruit essences, pure aseptio
pepsin tfree frqm animal impurities*.
Golden Seal and diastase. They -are soid
by druggists under the name of Stuart'-*
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Many Interesting experiments made
with these tablets show that they possess
remarkable digestive power, one grain of
the active principle in one of Stuart's
Dyspepsia ' Tablets being sufficient to ,
thoroughly digest 3000 grains of lean meat,
egg?, oatmeal or similar wholesome food.
Stuart's Tablets do not act upon the
bowels like after-dinner pills and cheap
cathartics, which simply irritate and in-
flame the intestines, without having any
effect whatever in curing indigestion.
If the stomach can be rested and as-
sisted in the work of digestion It will very
soon recover its normal vigor, as no or-
gan is so much abused and overworked a*
the stomach. This Is the secret and the
whole secret of the remarkable success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
practically unknown a few years ago
and now the most popular, safest and
most widely sold of any treatment for
stomach weakness. . )
This success has been secured entirely
upon Its merits as a digestive, pure and
simple; because there can be no stomach
trouble if the food is promptly digested.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entirely
upon the food eaten, digesting It com-
pletely, so that it can be assimilated Into
blood, nerve and tissue. ,
Every drop of blood, every bone, . nervÂ«
and tissue In the body can be renewed
In but one way, and that Is from whole-
some food properly digested. There Is no
other way. and the idea that a medicine
ln Itself can purify the blood or supply
new tissues and strong nerves is ridicu-
lous and on a par with the fol-de-rol that
dyspepsia is a germ disease or that other
fallacyâ that a weak stomach which re-
fuses to digest food can be made to do
so by Irritating and inflaming thÂ« bowels
by pills and cathartics.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure dyspep-
sia, water brash, sour stomach, catarrh
of the stomach, gas and bloating after
meals, because they furnish the diges-
tive power, which la the one thins that
weak stomachs lack, and unless that lack
Is supplied It Is useless to attempt to as-
sist it by the use of "tonics." "pills" and
cathartics, which have absolutely no di-
gestive, power and do not claim' to hava
any.
The regular use of one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, after meals, will
demonstrate their merit and efficiency
better than any other argument.
They are sold by druggists everywhere,
and a little booklet on cause and care of
stomach troubles will be mailed free by
addressing F. A. Stuart Co.. Marshall,

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â
It is possible that the Hepburn Nica
raguan canal bill may be passed by the
House of Representatives and it may be
even become a law before the Senate
acts on the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. Rep
resentative Hepburn is determined to
press the bill at every opportunity. He
maae two unsuccessful attempts to secure
unanimous consent for consideration of
the measure and then introduced a reso
lution which was referred to the Com
mittee on Rules proposing to make the
bill the special order for Tuesday, March
6, with the provision that at 5 o'clock on
the rullowing day the previous question
should be considered as ordered and l
vote be taken on the passage of the bill.
As soon as he could get the fl/>or when
the House met to-day he asked for unan
imous consent that the canal bill be taken
up two weeks from to-day. Representa
tive Richardson asked If there were any
thing in the bill recognizing the existence
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. Hepburn
said there was not and Richardson then
said there would be no objection from the
Democratic side.
Representative Cannon, chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, Interposei
an objection. He said that In view of the
present state of public business he was
not prepared to consent to the considera
tion, of the bill at the time suggested.
Hepburn then proposed to change the
date to one week from to-day, but Can
non again objected. The matter did not
come up again until just before the House
adjourned, when Cannon was not in his
seat. Hepburn again asked for unani
mous consent to take up the bill two
weekÃ from to-day. Hopnins of Illinois
said he did not want to object, but called
attention to the absence of his colleague,
Cannon. Payne said that unless there
was an understanding between Hepburn
and Cannon he would object to unanimous
consent in the absence of the latter. Hep
burn could not say that there was any
understanding and the request was agreed
to. ' ';:
It Is expected that the Committee on
Rules will report Hepburn's resolution fa
vorably, though it is possible. that some
change may be made in the date that he
has fixed for consideration of the bill.
Hepburn and many other advocates of
the canal bill In both houses of Congress
are in favor of passing the pending bill*
containing the authorization of the forti- I
ncation of the canal witnout regard to j
the action of the Senate on the pending j
treaty. In speaking of this subject Hep- ,
burn said it would make no material dif
ference whether the treaty were ratified
or not. If it should be agreed to by the
Senate and it should be determined that
the President had no power under the
treaty to fortify the canal . he need not
act under the authority given him to
erect fortifications. He thought it would
be well for Congress to give the Presi
dent all the authority that he could pos
sibly want/ â¢ ' ' Â¦Â¦->. .
FORTIFICATIONS NOT
NEEDED, SAYS DEWEY
Admiral Declares They Would Sim-
ply Result in Making a Battle
Ground of 'the Canal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â 0f great Im
portance in connection with the oppo
sition which has arisen because of the
mistaken belief that the United States
should never build a canal without erect-
Ing expensive fortifications to protect It
is an Interview I had to-day with Admiral
Dewey. Upon this particular point there
Is no one in the country better qualified
to speak or upon. whose Judgment more
reliance could be placed by the public at
large. It was his act more than that of
any other man which has resulted In
crystallizing sentiment at the present
time in favor r>t a great Isthmian water
way which will result In opening a short
pathway of commerce to the new posses
sions which have come to us by his work
In the Philippines. Said the admiral:
"Fortifications? Why, of course not.
As I understand it, the canal is to be â
and should be â a neutral commercial
highway between the two great oceans.
To fortify it would simply result In mak
ing it a battle-ground In case of war.
Fortifications would be enormously ex
pensive and ought not to be erected. Our
fleets would be a sufficient â¢ guarantee of
neutrality and the safety of the canal In
time of war as well as in peace."
Admiral Dewey is averse to maklns:
statements upon public questions, and, ln^
deed, has lately declined to be interviewed
on any question: but in the course of a
conversation with him this afternoon re
garding the pending treaty and canal he
consented to make the foregoing state
ment because of his positive conviction
that opposition to the pending treaty on
account of the provision prohibiting for
tifications is unwarranted.

LATEST WITNESS FOR MRS. CRAVEN-FAIR.
Miss Alma Greenwell, now a resident of Alameda and formerly a pupil
of Mrs. Craven, visited her the day following the execution of the marriage
contract and will testify to circumstances surrounding the event which will
have an important bearing on the case.
Webb remained but a few moments, and
as soon as he left the Senator brought up
the old subject of our marriage. He knew
I was preparing to go East and said
that he was afraid if I went away before
we were married I would not come back

whom I can counsel. I want some one

"It was then that he urged the marriage

interfere seriously with the settling up

his interests than I did of my own and

that he would say that a contract mar

Brady says Mr. Fair and Mrs. Craven
were very intimate friends in 1592 and he
regarded them as man and wife.
Fair turned very largely during the latter
part of the afternoon upon an effort to
learn what papers, other than those
placed In evidence, the witness has or
ever had In her possession. Attorney
McEnerney sought to demonstrate, at one
stage of the proceedings, that because
Senator Fair had made no provision for
Mrs. Craven-Fair in his will he was con
sequently not married to her, that be
cause he had been a forgetful husband
he had been no husband at all. That sort
of logic did not Impress the court favor
ably and that line of Inquiry was aban
doned. ' j
In answer to queries the witness de
clared that upon one occasion, when faena
tor Fair was in a writing mood, he made
a written transfer to her of all the bonds
and stocks of which he was possessed.
The witness declared that she had not
sought the transfer and she could not tell
what had become of the document. The
examination then turned to Fair -s will
writing propensities, but nothing that was
material or interesting was developed.
The case will bo resumed this morning
at 10:30 o'clock. When court adjourned
yesterday afternon it was learned that
Attorney Pence had received telegraphic
Information of the death of his mother.
The news softened for a moment the bit
ter feeling which rules at the trial and
brought forth for the lawyer expressions
of sympathy In his bereavement.
WANTS SCANDAL PROBED.
W. W. Foote, one of the attorneys for
Mrs. Craven-Fair, has addressed the fol
lowing communication to the District At
torney regarding the Slmpton scandal:

Impart to you some information which may
be of value In ascertaining: the truth in re-

desire to say that I will be at your disposal
at any time that you may designate, either
at your office or at mine, to give you all the

LAMEDA has produced another
witness for Mrs. Craven-Fair. The
| \ Encinal City has entered the arena
&*% with Sausalito for the glory of be
| Jains the best evidence-producing
J town about the bay. Alameda's
I t latest contribution to the celebrities
|of the Craven-Fair case is Miss Alma
Greenwell, who was a Mrs. Hcaney until
the divorce courts severed the matrimo
; nial ties that had proved irksome.
I Miss Greenwell was a pupil of Mrs. Cra
ven at the Mission Grammar School. She
was but 15 years old at the time of Mrs.
! Craven-Fair's contract marriage, but she
was old enough to make mental note of
: all thaÂ£ occurred and to-day her mind is
I as clear on the subject as though it had
i taken place but yesterday.
Confided in Miss Greenwell.
According to the testimony yesterday of
the petitioner for a family allowance from
j the Fair estate Miss Greenwell was a vls
! itor at the Craven-Fair home, 823 Sutter
street, the day after the wedding. It is
asserted that the "bride" told her guest
all about the ceremony.
The circumstance that Miss Greenwell
had visited her the day after the wedding
reminded Mrs. Craven-Fair that it was
on May. 24, 1592, that she called upon
Judge Sullivan to discuss acknowledging
the marriage contract before a notary.
She had a faint recollection that she had
told her visitor what had happened and
had to excuse herself to go downtown
to consult with her attorney.
Was Mrs. Craven's Pupil.
The new witness' statement does not
agree in all details with the testimony
of Mrs. Craven-Fair, although her evi
dence will have an Important bearing on
the case. When seen at her home in
Alameda last night Miss Greenwell said:
"Mrs. Craven was the principal of the
.Mission Grammar School, which I attend
ed. I was a member of the class which
graduated in the summer of 1892. It was
the time of the Columbus celebration.
We gave an opera at the Grand Opera
house at which I took the leading part.
Mrs. Craven and I were -quite friendly
and she took a prominent part in the ar
rangements for the affair.
Was With the Senator.
"When the play was over on the night
of May 24, 1892. I invited Mrs. Craven to
share our carriage and go to the banquet
Â¦which we afterward had. She was with
Senator Fair. She declined to come with
us. That Is the night I believe she was
married to him. I think her reason for
declining to come with us was that she
expected to have the marriage ceremony
performed that night. I know nothing
more than I have related and nothing
about the marriage more than I have
stated.
"I was Quite friendly with Mrs. Craven
and frequently called on her. She was
living at 823 Sutter street at the time of
the marriage.
"I was a schoolgirl then and 15 years
old. At 17 I was married to Mr. Heaney.
After ten months we were divorced."
Alameda's latest contribution to the
celebrated case will be marched into court
later as a companion piece to Ben F. Lam
born. 'Â¦?.'
The Lie Passed.
The array of attorneys in the case have
finally wrought themselves up to the pitch
of passing the He. The fiareup was like
an oasis in a desert of dreary questions
and dlsinteresting answers. Lafe Pence
told Mr. Heggerty that there might be
circumstances under which he would be
lieve him and Mr. Heggerty retorted that
Pence ' was a double-barreled liar. At
torney McEnerney was endeavoring to
jump in as peacemaker when the storm
passed over and the' case continued" to
drag along its weary Way. '
I Mrs. Craven-Fair. waÂ» on . the witness
\tand all day yesterday. She was not in
ihe best of humor and once during her
testimony a big lump arose in her throat
aid a vagrant tear stole down her cheek.
A3 this might hayÂ« bean for effect, but
thvlady mxda a bold effort to ooaoutl
her real or counterfeit emotion and suc
ceeded nobly.
She was not as good a witness for her
self as she had been the previous day.
While Attorney Pierson, who conducted
the cross-examination, was courteous to
the extreme he was more persistent in
his questions. Once or twice he had the
witness in a corner and the only way
in which she wiggled out of giving an
answer that might have annoyed her was
by a convenient lapse of memory that was
simply charming.
Her Memory Failed Her.
"I don't recall," was the way she put it.
Her recollection of the events of May
23, 1892, the day when it is claimed the
alleged marriage contract was signed, was
extremely hazy. She could not "recall"
whether the document was signed in the
afternoon or the evening; whether she had
written it on a table, on a desk or on the
floor, or whether she had stood up when
she handled the pen. Much of the day
was spent iin relating the history of the
contract, and it was during this, when the
questions became - annoying, that the
lapses of memory so conveniently oc
curred.
Attorney Pierson endeavored to learn If
she had any letters or documents purport
ing to have been written by the late Sena
tor. He succeeded in forcing the produc
tion of a scrap of paper, which, it is
claimed, was torn from one of Fair's
memorandum books at the Grand Opera
house the night after the contract mar
riage, and on which he had written:
"Mrs. James G. : Do you know
your name? JAMES G. FAIR."
Received Many Sweet Notes.
While admitting that she had received
many endearing epistles from her alleged
spouse she could not for the life of her.
"recall" what had become of them, when
she had last seen them or to whom she
had given them. '-..'-
When the case was called yesterday
morning Mrs. Hilbert, who had been the
"observed of all observers" the day be
fore, was not present. She displayed the
good sense, presumably, of staying home
out of the wet, which cannot be said of
the curious throng with upstretched necks
that filled the courtroom until the atmos
phere of the place was stifling. Barling
was there, however, without a visible
sign of the thumping. his connection with
the case had caused him.
Story of the Contract.
"Without any preliminaries Mrs. Craven-
Fair was put on the witness stand to
continue to undergo the fire of Attorney
Pierson's questions, all of which were
apparently "loaded." He started right in
on the marriage contract and the circum
stances surrounding Its creation.
The witness said it was signed at 823
Sutter street, but she was uncertain as to
the room in which the document was ex
ecuted.
"I do not recall," she said, "whether
we signed it in the afternoon or evening.
I know when I returned home on the af
ternoon of May 23, 1892, in company with
Captain Frank Webb, the Senator was
there ahead of us and opened the door.
ment at Fair's dictation and remembered
that he had signed it first from the fact
that she had remarked to him:
"You must take me first."
She was positive he had only signed In
one place. The ceremony was brief and
the Senator left the house before the ink
on the contract was fairly dry.
"I asked him if it should not be ac
knowledged by a notary," she continued,
"and he advised me to talk to Judge Sul
livan about it and said that If I did not
attend to the matter at once he would
not go to my school exhibition at the
Grand. Opera-house. I agreed to do so
and arranged to meet him the next day at
Sutter and Montgomery streets to let him
know what Judge Sullivan said." " -
"Where did you get the idea that it
should be acknowledged?" asked Attorney
Plerson.
"From my own fertile brain, I pre
sume."
Mrs. Craven-Fair gave as a reason for
not being able to remember more of the
important details of her wedding day the
fact that her school exhibition had oc
cupied her mind more than her marriage,
although she did not consider it of more
importance. Â»
A Few Tears Flowed.
She failed to recall if a ceremonial mar
riage was suggested at the time the con
tract was in course of construction, but
she did recollect that Mr. Fair had as
serted that as her mother was dead the
latter could offer no objection to the con
tract style. It was here that the witness
choked up and her eyes moistened. The
contract was carried about in the same
old way that women guard their valua
bles. At times it was close to Mrs. Cre
ven-Fair'e heart, occasionally it was car
ried in her hand satchel, but its most fre
quent resting place was 4n her hosiery.
Judge Sullivan told her the contract
was all right as It stopd, but that it would
be stronger if acknowledged by a notary.
She met the Senator at the appointed
place and he wanted to go at once to
Notary Craig's office and have the ad
ditional Btrength placed on the contract.
They saw Craig on their way and hailed
him. The Senator said to the notary:
"Nettie and I w.ere married last night
and we want to get the paper acknowl
edged." The contract was shown to
Craig. It was never acknowledged, but
the cause therefore did not come out in
the evidence.
Pence Tells Why He "Fished."
The Senator attended the school exhi
bition after that in company with Arthur
Rogers and the late Pete Bigelow. It
was there that he passed her the slip of
paper on which was written the query
concerning her name. This testimony was
the signal for the outburst among the
liiwvftrs
Lafe Pence said that he was willing to
admit that his object in "fishing" for the
Senator's books was to show that the
slip of paper was a leaf torn from one
of them. . . . . Â¦ â¢ .':' -'Â¦

CONFESSION OF
A TRAIN ROBBER
Jack Dunlap Tells Who
His Pals Were.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 20.-Jack Dunlap,
known as "Three-flngered ' Jack," the
train-robber shot by Express Messenger
Milton In the recent hold-up at Fair
banks, Ariz., In an interview with Chief
Detective Thacker to-day at Tombstone,
made a confession of the train robbery
and named all who took part in the af
fair. He made the confession in a fit of
anger against his associates, who deserted
him In the fight and . left him, in his
wounded condition, helpless.
A notorious cowboy and general bad
character by the name of Bravo Juan
nas been identified as one of the robbers.
Juan entered the express car. after Milton
had been shot and took Milton's revolver.
The latter to-day, on being told that
Bravo John had his pistol, remarked:
1 If the officers don't have him in two
weeks I will be on his trail. "
Detective Thacker also had an Inter
view with the Owens brothers, who are
rÂ£w custc 2 dy charged \*lth the robbery,
ihey also made a statement involving
Part es whose names are withheld.
MUton says that he had .received Infor
mation that the robbery had been planned
and had requested the express company
to put on guards.
A preliminary . hearing waa given the
Owens brothers and Jack Dunlap before
Judge Emanuel this afternoon. Dunlap
is in a dying condition.
other claims exactly similar, aggregating
$34,000. depend on the issue of this suit.
Points of Federal law are Involved and
the case will flnd its way to the United
States Supreme Court.
Judge Williams appeared in his own be
half and Wells, Fargo & Co. are repre
sented by B. S. Pillsbury of San Fran
cisco.
The plaintiffs were all stockholders in
the defendant bank, which, in 1896, fore
seeing a stringency in Its business affairs,
requested or suggested to the Controller
of the Currency that it be authorized or
directed to make an assessment upon the
shareholders. The directors accordingly,
in the following December, passed a reso
lution levying such assessment. The plain
tiffs refused to pay the assessment. Their
6tock, as provided by the Federal statute
in such cases, was put up at auction and
sold, bringing 50 cents on the dollar. This
was the amount of the assessment. The
bank got its money, while the stockhold
ers were out their stock.
The plaintiffs in their suit allege that
the assessment was illegal and void, chief
ly for the reason that the stockholders
had no notice thereof and that without
such notice the directors were not author
ized by the bank's charter or by the Fed
eral laws to levy such an assessment
The bank demurred to the complaints,
contending that the assessment was legal.
The matter was argued some time ago at
length, and Judges Sears and Frazer over
ruled the demurrer, holding that the as
sessment was illegally made.
At the trial to-day counsel for the de
fendant called Cashier R. M. Dooly to the
witness eland and asked him concerning
the assets of the bank and their condition
in May. 18&7. In support of this evidence,
which was objected to by plaintiffs' attor
neys, Mr. Pillsbury said the measure of
their recovery was the value of the stork
at the time of its conversion. If it had no
value at the time of the sale they were
not entitled to recover.
Judge Williams, in reply, eaid the bank
bad no right to convert stock to its own
use and make a defense that the stock is
of no value. The plaintiff is entitled to
his Btock. The law will not- permit a de
fendant to say, "Your stock was not
worth anything, therefore I can convert
It to my own use."
PURSUED BY A
STRANGE FATE
Sad Story of Mr. and
Mrs. A. J. Silva.
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 20.â The strange
fate which has overtaken the Sllvas haa
awakened much interest among search
ers for' the mysterious. For twenty
years A. J. Sllva and wife have lived in
this city, and during that time, by dint of
.Industry, have built up a fortune suf
ficient to have enabled them to live in
comfort the rest of their lives. Both held
the respect and esteem of the community.
A pronounced sensation, therefore, was
caused a couple of months ago, when
Silva openly accused his wife of plotting
to murder him. The suspicion that this
was but a delusion on the part of the
husband was dispelled when Silva brought
forward a witness who swore that Mrs.
Silva had offered him $40 to perform the
deed. The authorities advised Sllva to
remain away from his place of business
long enough to permit. his wife to believe
him dead. This was done and Mrs. Silva
expressed no remorse, but rather prom
ised to reward the supposed murderer
more substantially when her , husband's
estate should be settled. Mrs. Sllva waa
taken Into custody and Judge Anderson
deemed the evidence of sufficient weight
to Justify placing Mrs. Sllva under heavy

ened plot against her husband Into exe
cution. Afterward on complaint of her
husband, she was charged with insanity,
examined and declared of pound mind. A
divorce from her husband followed. ' Â¦
All this time Sllva conducted his busi
ness affairs as he had done for years and
there was not the slightest suspicion as
to his sanity. On Saturday' last he sent
to his ranch down the river for som*
sheep, and when they arrived he caused
one of them, which appeared to be ill, to
be killed, and an examination conducted
by two veterinary surgeons. Learning
that pneumonia had caused the death of
the sheep Sllva ordered a hack and seven
white horses to draw it and set about to
give the deceased mutton a swell funeral.
The obsequies were called off at the last
moment, however, by the refusal of the
stablemen to comply with his demands.
On the following morningâ last Sunday
âhe attended mass at the Cathedral, and
after the collection had -been- taken up
walked up to the altar rail and emptied
the contents of four of the. boxes into a
meal bag. The act was performed so
leisurely that scarcely anybody among
the hundreds of parishioners present mar
veled at it. Sllva left the church with
the bag In his hands, but waa followed
and taken into 1 " custody. This afternoon
he was examined and ordered committed
to the asylum for the Insane.

The seven thousand spectators saw the

CHICAGO, Feb. 20.â Jack Root, the
clever Western middle-weight, decisively
defeated Ed Denfass of Philadelphia at
Tattersalls to-night in the fourth round
of what was to have been a six-round
contest. The fighting while It lasted wa3
more like a scrap between two longshore
men than scientific boxers, both men re
sorting to clinching i and wrestling and
going to the floor several times In their
clinches. Â¦ Root, however, clearly out
classing his man, put his left to Denfass'
face with terrific force time and again
without a return. A right hook to the
Vapor, of Medicated Bath, with no possibility
of taking cold afterward, or In any way weak-
ening, the system.
Hundreds of well-known physicians have
given up their practice to sell this Cabinet-
such eminent men as Emerson McKay, Detroit,
who has already sold over TOO, and John C.
Wright, Chicago, who sold 125 last month.
Thousands of remarkable letters have been
written the makers from users, some of which,
referring to
Rheumatism, La Grippe, Kidney
Troubles,
will be Interesting to those who suffer from
there dread maladies. W. L. Brown, Oxford,
0., writes: "My father was down In bed for
months with rheumatism. This Cabinet did him
more good than 150 worth of drugs." O. M.
Lafferty, Covington, Ky., writes: "Was com-
pelled to quit business* a year ago, being pros-
trated with rheumatism and kidney troubles,
when your Cabinet came. â¢ Two weeks' use
cured me; I have never had a twinge since."
Rev. George H. Hudson. Okemos, Mich., says:
"I gave up my pastorate on account of nervous
prostration and lung troubles. My editor so
highly recommended your Cabinet I tried It;
from that day I have Bteadily grown better;
am now well; nervousness gone; lungs strong;
am a new man." Mrs. Ober, No. 904 Broad nt.,
Columbus, 0., writes: "It is grand for curing
colds, la grippe. Inflammation, aches, pains; it
cured my uncle of neuralgia and sleeplessness,
with which he had long suffered. A neighbor
cured herself of la grippe In one night, her
little girl of measles, her son of croup. Another
neighbor cured eczema of many years' stand-
Ing." Hon. A. B. Strickland of Bloomlngton.
writes that the Cabinet i\ld him more good than
city Is more easy and rapid. Sufficient
funds come in 'on "deposit to meet the
daily needs of the business. A second rea
son Is because the wealthy men of thÂ«
city are loth to loan their money on
country property. This Is due to the fact
that they consider it but a second-class
security, inasmuch as its value Is more
fluctuating, while they' cannot look after
It personally. Another reason is that real
estate agents have so long misrepresent
ed the value of country property that
money-lenders have become skeptical.
Again, the bankers of the cities have lost
considerable money on country loans.
This amount is larger than many people
realize, for the reason that while bank
ers willingly publish their assets and lia
bilities, they do not care to make known
the extent of their losses. Mr. Torchiana
advocated the establishment of country
banks something after the plan of postal
savings banks, saying that although the
relations between the country banker and
the horticulturist had always been very
pleasant, he felt that the higher func
tions of banking could better be per
formed by the governmental Bystem.
Balance of Nature.
The last address of the day was deliv
ered by Professor John H. Comstock of
the department of entomology. His sub
ject was "The Balance of Nature." The
speaker showed that though all species
of animals and plants tend to Increase In
a geometrical ratio the number of the
species living remains relatively the
same. No one expects, on the one hand,
that the oaks will completely cover even
the uncivilized portions of the valley, nor,
on the other hand, that the oak caterpil
lar will destroy the existing oaks. The
two species, the plant and the Insect, the
host and the pest, live side by side with
out either attaining the supremacy. The
forces that make for the good or the ill
of either species act with somewhat vary
ing strength, so that there may be slight
movements up or down. But on the
whole, when the conditions for any con
siderable period are studied, it is found
that the fluctuations are comparatively
slight, and that there exists a matching
of forces which may be termed the bal
ance of nature.
.While there are tnousands of species of
insects living in the United States prob
ably less than 100' are serious pests to civ
ilization. Secondly, there Is a balancing
of forces which prevents the undue in
crease of any species, except temporarily.
If there is added to the forces that make
for the good of cultivated crops the intel
ligent action of man, it follows that the
balance will be In favor of the crops.
While the cultivator should not relax his
vigilance he should take courage that
with intelligent effort Me is sure to win
in the fight.
But the Fittest Survive.
According to the now generally accept
ed theory of evolution, the speaker said,
there results from the tendency of each
species of animal or plant to increase In
a geometrical ratio a severe struggle for
existence, which results in the destruc
tion of the weaker individuals, and the
survival of only those best fitted to bear
the struggle for existence. There will
follow from this a weeding out of those
plants that cannot withstand the Insect
attack and a natural selection of the in
sect resisting forms.
Turning to the forces that tend to pro
tect the plant by weakening the insect at
tack are noted the climatic condition*,
diseases of various kinds, and the action
of â¢ predaceous and parasitic forms. On
thfs coast the long, dry summer- probably
does more than any other climatic con
dition to keep in check the Increase of
noxious Insects. This seems to be much
more destructive oi insect life than the
cold winters of the East. This may be
the reason that not one-tenth as many
ppecles of insects exist here as in equally
fertile regions in the Eastern States.
The factors most helpful in preserving
the balance between plants and their in
sect pests are the predaceous Insects
that wage war upon these pests and the
parasites tiiat destroy them.
It is important that the horticulturist
should become familiar with the opera
tions of those allies and with their ap
pearance, so as to be able to recognize
them and thus avoid destroying them.
Often large numbers of ladybugs have
been destroyed simply because they were
not recognized as friends.
The lecturer then described the appear
ance and habits of various predaceous in
sects, and of insect parasites.
Musicale Enjoyed.
. To-night an enjoyable musicals was
given in the Assembly Hall In honor of
the guest of the university by Henry L.
Bettman, violinist, of San Jose, assisted
by Mrs. Susie Hert-Mark. soloist, and
Mrs. Edith Yurndley-Fallenlus, pianist, of
San Francisco.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 20.â
The second day of the Fruit Growers'
Convention at Stanford was marked by
increased interest and attendance among
the visitors. Throughout the day the
room set apart for the lectures was well
filled and the words of the four speakers
were listened to with an eagerness indi
cating that the hearers recognized the
importance to themselves of what was
being said.
The first address of the day was de
livered by President Jordan, who spoke
upon "The Selections of New Forms of
Fruit." The processes by which new
forms are produced were explained and
some of the more important varieties pro
duced in California were described. The
speaker gave in a few words a clear con
ception of how plants and animals start
in life, bringing out prominently the spe
cial points of his lectureâ heredity and the
hybridizing and selection of new forms.
Continuing he said in part:
"If we should lose all our cultivated
fruits, apples, pears, plums etc., we could
develop them all again from our wild
plants. Select breeding and hydrldizing
are the magician's wand by which we
can summon up any form, of plant or ani
mal we, want. It is said by Summerville
that one can chajk out on the wall the
kind of sheep wanted and then create that
sheep. The same is true .of a pumpkin or
berry. But in creating new fruits it is
a general maxim not to try for all forms
at once. The whole process is one of
hybridizing" and then selecting those
forms that have the desired qualities.
"It is a common saying that all arti
ficially formed fruits rapidly degenerate.
This simply means that certain kinds of
fruit are subordinated to others. These
facts have to be taken into consideration.
Sometimes the vitality of the fruit' is
sacrificed and sometimes it Is some other
quality. This sort of work gains on one
side and loses on the other. We gala
what we work lor. Wisdom would lead
us to gain on the side demanded by the
market."
How to Fight Pests.
E. SI. Ehrhorn, entomologist far Santa
Clara .County, next spoke on "Fighting
Insect Pests," saying in part:
"California with hÂ»r glorious climate
presents a great field for investigation." It
is said that the United States have done
more in economic entomology than any
other country In the world, and it is also
said that California has done more in
practical entomology than any State in
the Union. Why have wÂ« accomplished so
much in California? Surely not on ac
count of systematic procedure or scien
tific investigations! We admit that some
cases had scientific investigation, but the
bulk of our success was obtained in a
haphazard way and . all we may say Is
that the Lord was with us. There are
numberless questions confronting us to
day and the following may be of interest:
"Why does carbon bisulphide injure
some trees and not others?
"Why is almond root more susceptible
to injury by this liquid than other roots?
"Why does some of the liquid kill borers
while some of it does not kill them when
the same method of application is used?
"Why does the San Jose scale thrive on
a dusty tree?
"These and many other questions are
puzzling us to-day. A few competent in
vestigators in the field would soon deter
mine these questions. The life histories
of all our pests would be cleared up and
this means half the battle. The time has
come when the fruit-grower must study
these matters more carefully. He should
endeavor to get acquainted with all the
pests of his Industry. If ho finds an in
sect destroying his trees or crops he
should send a few specimens to some com
petent person for -determination who will
also be able to give him a good remedy
for it. If he finds Insects which he la
In doubt about, whether they are benefi
cial or injurious, he should not kill them
until he finds out all about them. Many
instances have come to my knowledge
where beneficial insects have been
slaughtered for years by individuals who
did not know that they were killing their
best friends."
The Country Bank.
IL-W. Torchiana spoke on "The Coun
try Bank and Its Relation to the Horti
culturist." He traced the rise of the bank
ing: system as a civilized Institution I ,' cul
minating in the founding of the Bank of
England in 1694. He took the poation that
the sphere of the country bank is to make
the currency of the community as pro
ductive as possible. It should be in the
hands 'ot some man who has the entire
confidence of the community and who
thoroughly understands the banking busi
ness. He asserted that there is a two
fold reason why Interest charges are
higher in the country than in the city.

CLARK'S FRIENDS POSE
AS POLITICAL PURISTS
Corbett, Wellcome and Day Deny All
Evidence Connecting Them
With Bribery.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 20.â Senator Clark
?o-day continued and completed his testi
mony before the Senate Committee on
Klectlons, but his testimony did not at
tract as much attention as that of other
witnesses who were heard during the day.
The other witnesses were Frank Corbett
of Butte, recalled; E. C. Day, who was
the Clark leader on the floor of the Mon
tana House of Representatives, and John
B. Wellcome, who was a general manager
for Clark. Wellcome did not take the
stand until late and his examination in
Chief was not completed when the com
mittee adjourned for the day. He made
a general and specific denial of all the al
legations made by Wbiteslde and others.
Denials were made in response to ques
tions by Faulkner, and the witness uni
formly answered "I did not," "No" or
"Nothing like it occurred."
Day admitted having accepted a present
of j;Â»vj from Clark, tuid said that he un
derstood it was given as a testimonial and
as compensation for his services. His
oath of office as a member of the House
was read and seemed to produce quits an
Impression upon some of the committee.
Corbett and Justice Piggott con
fronted one another for a brief .period
early In the day and in a rather dramatic
manner. They both testified concerning
a meeting held by Corbett. and there was
a direct clash In statements.
Clark on the Stand.
When the cross-examination of Clark
was resumed the first Inquiry related to
the memorandum of expenses already
supplied by the Senator. He said he had
prepared this statement from the books
of his bank. He had not only destroyed
his checks but also the check stubs, but
was confident that the showing made waa
correct. . Clark said that so far as he
knew the committee acting in his behalf
In the campaign had not filed any state
ment of expenditures, as required by the
Montana election law. He had made none.
He had not considered himself as a can
didate when the members of the Legisla
ture met. Money supplied by him later
was for the purpose of expenses already
Incurred and not as a Senatorial candi
date.
Where Aid your ton ret the 120.000 he paid
during the session of the Legislature?
I presume he checked on his own account,
but I don't know.
What explanation did Mr. Wellcome make
when be made his demand upon you for $16,000?
He said, as well aa I remember, that he had
drawn upon his own account. He will, how
ever, be able to tell you about that. I required
no detailed statement from him, feeling confi
dent the expenditure was made in a legitimate
way.
Hoar Grows Incredulous.
deferring to one of Dr. Ector's letters
concerning Representative Woods. Mr.
Clark said he understood that Mr. Woods
wa.B a good-natured man and liable to be
influenced by those who saw uiin first.
IIÂ» bald he did not believe that he was
Becking or would take a bribe. He be
lieveu, however, that Dr. Ector bimseli
Â¦was intimating that he wanted pecuniary
remuneration. He said, though, that he
had merely glanced the letter over and
pa*>sed it to Blckford. This last remark
aroused the interest of Hoax, who asked
a number of questions, showing incred
ulity in the matter, but Clark Insisted
tTTSt he did not know Ector and that he
had given little attention to the letter,
notwithstanding it related to the vote or
a member of the Legislature.
Campbell asked Clark about the pur
chase of ex-Senator Power's stock in the
Fergus County Bank, in which State Sen
ator Hobson. chairman of the Republican
caucus of the Montana Legislature, is a
partner. Clark said he had understood
after his election as Senator that Senator
Power was incensed at Hobson for voting
for him (Clark) and had told Hobson that
he must find a purchaser for him (Pow
er's) stock, of which he owned 400 shares.
The Senator said he had investigated the
matter, finding the ctock to be dividend
paving, and had told Power that he would
take it, provided it was offered at par.
This offer was made later, after he had
pone to Europe, and Johnson, cashier of
Clark Brothers' Bank, consummated the
trade, paying $46,000 for the stock on his
account. Clark also testified in regard to
the $25,000 loan made by him to the Ross-
Dyer Mercantile Company but said co far
as he knew this firm had no connection
with State Senator Hanna.
Corbett Enters a Denial.
Frank Corbett was called to testify
concerning incidents growing out of his
visit to Helena on a special train In con
nection with C. W. Clark and Whitmore
on August 5 last. He said he had not at
that time known Dr. Treacey, never, hav
ing been introduced to him until early in
November of last year. Be said informa
tion had come to him that Wellcome's
Helena attorney said he did not mean to
file any answer. He had told Charley
Clark that the matter was a serious and
Important one and should be attended to.
"The trip was made for that purpose,"
paid Corbett, "and the idea that I had
anything to do with bribing the Supreme
Court is simply insane."
He declared he had received no message
from J. S. M. Neill to come to Helena, as
there was a possibility of doing business
with the Supreme Court, and explained
that he held a mortgage against Neill.
Faulkner said:
"Having read Justice Plggott's testi
mony, have you any correction to make of
your statement formerly given to this
committee?
"I have not," replied the witness; "my
statement is there with Judge Plgffott's
and will have to stand." , ; v '
Clark Denounces Daly.
Senator Clark was recalled and, in re
sponse to a question said he wanted the
control of the Legislature "in order, that
we might have some recognition of our
personal rights, because if Daly and his
following were to have control property
wes not safe nor life enjoyable." HÂ«
continued, saying that the Dalyites had
deprived people, especially in Silver Bow
County, of their right to choose for
themselves in many ways, and that the
boycott was a common weapon against
those who did not recognize the Daly
power. He thought also that the Daly
people were determined to control the
county offices for the purpose of per
petuating their political control, and to
prevent this was one of the motives of
himself and his friends. His own candi
dacy had not been an issue In the legisla
tive election.
At Chandler's instance Clark related
particulars concerning his former politi
cal contests. He Bald that in his contest
for Congress in ISSS Daly had promised
up to the night before election to sup
port him, but when the voting began the
shift bosses in the Daly mines were found
to be liberally provided with pasters,
which they placed over his name in the
interest of Carter. The result was his
defeat by a large majority.
Day's Gift From Clark.
Hon. E. C. Day of the Montana House
of Representatives, who " was the Clark
candidate for the speakership of the
House, was called to the stand, He Eaid
he had been nominated as a friend of
Senator Clark, and then detailed the par
ticulars of the presentation to him of
$5000 from Clark. Said he:
While I was a member of the Legislature
no man ever approached or offered me any
money, but the day after the Legislature ad
journed Mr. Davidson came to my office, say
ing- he had come to express Mr. Clark's thanks
for my services and to present me a testi
monial of his regard and a retainer for legal
services in connection with the prospective
Senatorial contest. With that he handed me
an envelope containing two- certificates of de
posit for J2500 each. I thought over the mat
ter, probably as long as I have been telling
this, and took the certificates and deposited
them. Since then I have considered myself
Mr. Clark's attorney in every political matter.
Did you consider that JiOOO a retaining fee
or a rift?
I looked upon it partly as a gift and partly
as a retaining fee.
Did you place it to the credit of your law
firm; and, if not, why not 7
The' firm does not keep a bank account.
Did you divide this money with other mem
bers of your firm?
No; it was paid on my own personal account.

Wellcome Explains.
John B. Wellcome was called. He, next
to C. W. Clark, was Senator Clark's chief
representative in Helena during the ses
sion of the Legislature last winter. Well
come said he had gone to Helena to be
one of Clark's managers at the request of
the friends of the Senator, but that the
Senator himself knew nothing of the' ar
rangement until after It was made. -
Wellcome detailed Ills version of his
various Interviews with Whiteside. He
said that at one of these meetings "White
side had told him Senator Anderson would
vote for Clark and he had merely ex
pressed his gratification at this news.
Whlteslde had told him he was friendly
to Clark and intended to vote for him.
"He did not, however, take any part In
the advocating of Clark's election except
to myself." said the witness.
Whiteslde had been Introduced to him.
by either C. W. Clark or Neill. Whiteside
had then told him he was tired of his
affiliation with the Daly faction. Many
people had warned him against "White
side, but his uniform reply was that "hÂ©
can do no harm. If he does not vote for
Clark we will lope nothing; If he does we
will gain something." He had never au
thorized Whiteslde, he said, to see other
members of the Legislature, nor had he
offered or given him $10,000 nor any other
sum as a bribe for his vote. He had not
authorized "Whlteslde to offer Senator
Anderson $10,000 for his vote, nor had he
said he would pay more for that Sena
tor's vote. !
In like manner "Wellcome was led over
a great deal of the ground covered by the
previous Â¦witnesses who had used his
name. He denied each charpe that he
had authorized the use of money to Influ
ence legislators to vote for Clark.

4THE twenty-fifth annual session of
the Fire Underwriters' Association
of the Pacific opened In this city
yesterday. Annual reports were sub
mitted and addresses made. Papers
touching upon the various phases of the
Insurance business were read and dis
cussed. The association Is composed of
Tl2 active and twenty-eight honorary
members. Most of these were present and
gTeat interest was displayed in the pro-
sidered so important that It was referred
for consideration to a committee of ihree,
who will report on If at the semi-annual
meeting.
Herbert Folger and C. Mason Kinnc
took part in other discussions. John T.
Fogarty reported for the executive com
mittee and Herbert Folger for the library
committee. The session will continue to
day when an election of officers will be
held. To-night the Insurance men will
hold a banquet at a downtown restaurant.
ceedings of the day.
One of the features of the session was
the address of Edward Xlles. the presi
dent of the association. He scored the
insurance companies that were attempt-
Ing to reduce rates and advocated a poliov
which would protect the company as well
as the person whose property has been
insured against loss. The speaker told
cf the benefits of the equitable compact
system and of Its relation to the improve
ment in the construction of buildings and
of fire departments and water systems.
To the standard methods he attributed
the repression of incendiarism and pro
tection of property and said that the rate
cutters, while enjoying all the advantages
to be derived from such a system were
displaying ingratitude by the guerrilla
ana cowardly practice of undermining the
strong pillars of the Insurance man's
prosperity.
President Niles stated that personally
he had nothing to say against the coast
agents of sucn companies. They were
doubtless acting under instructions and
it was to the companies themselves that
he directed his remarks. He stated that
their practices should not be tolerated and
that an effort should be made to suppress
them.
A memorial was then offered to the
members of the association who have
been called by death during the past year.
President Niles spoke with much feollng
on the past careers of B. M. Barrett of
Portland, Hiram Staats of Pasadena and
William J. Callingham. George F. Ashton.
William H. Bayley, Charles R. Story and
J. O. Wilson of New York.
Papers of interest to Insurance men
were read by William Sexton, Calvert

Brown, George W. Dornln, George F.
Grant, Franz Jacoby and George F. Low.

J. B. STETSON'S BRIDE
IS A BUSINESS WOMAN
She Has Only a Life Interest in the Doe
Estate.
SOCIETY consoled itself for not be
ing "among those present" at the
wedding of J. B. Stetson and Mrs.
Eleanor Doe at Pasadena yester
day by greeting ono another with
a trite "I told you so." Rumors of the en
gagement of the aged millionaire and the
widow of the wealthy lumber man were
afloat so often that when the announce
ment of the wedding finally came the
bloom was off the peach. Even the fact
that the children of the groom had with
held their consent failed to Interest, for
that, too, was an ofttlmo told tale.
She Has No Millions.
The lady who yesterday became the wife
of the aged railway man has- enjoyed a
reputation for far greater wealth than she
actually possesses. Six years ago when
John S.-Doo died he left an estate that
was appraised at $1,200,000. One hundred
thousand dollars of this estate was willed
to various relatives and the remainder
was to remain in trust with Barlett Doe
and Charles Doe; the revenue of one-half
of the estate to be paid ovor to the wlUow
and the revenue of the other half to the
child The widow was to receive her
Share in monthly installments of $1000 and
if at the end of the year the revenue ex-
ceeded more than the twelve monthly
payments that sum was to be paid over
to the widow. At the death of the widow
the money was to revert to the daughter,
the only issue of the marriage. If. how
ever, the daughter should die before at
taining majority her share in her father's
estate was to revert to her paternal rela
tives.
Invested All Her Money.
John Doe's widow has proved herself a
capable business woman and more than
able to look after her child's Interests and
her own. Her Income from the vast

has Invested wisely, real estate receiving
her especial attention. The result is that
Mr. Stetson's wife has considerable landed
interests, and although not a millionaire
is still not in financial straits.
Not a Society Woman.
Since Mr. Doe's death Mrs. Stetson has
lived very quietly and It !s doubtful If a

tbe pleasure of her acquaintance.
Whether she will meet Mr. Stetson's se

ONE SCHOOL MAY
BE SACRIFICED

Class Consolidation to
Cease.
VIEWS OF SUPERINTENDENT
?
LONGFEIXOW OB STANFORD UN
DER CONSIDERATION.
Pupils Will Be Transferred to Other
Near-By Institutions Which
Have a Number of Va
cant Classrooms.
The Board of Education has called a
halt In Its avowed policy of consolidating
classes in the public schools, and at Us
meeting this morning it Is not expected
that any consolidations will be put into
effect. At a recent secret caucus the prop,
osition of consolidating a class each in the
Le Conte and Hancock schools was se
riously considered, and had It not been
for the strenuous objections of Superin
tendent Webster, who has all along been
opposed to the board insisting that the
mathematical rule of forty pupils in pri
mary grades and fifty In the grammar
classes be strictly adhered to. the consoli
dations In the two schools named would
undoubtedly have taken place.
The board. It Is understood. Is now di
recting Its attention to the abolition of at
least one" school In the district south of
Market street, and on this point Super
intendent Webster is quite In accord with
the directors. The two schools now un
der consideration for abolition are the
Longfellow and the Stanford, either of
which, in the opinion of Mr. Webster,
could be dispensed with without Impairing
the efficiency of the department, for the
classes could be transferred with ad
vantage to other schools. There Is now a
vacant prindpalshlp at the Edison School,
to which Mrs. Lyon of the Stanford or
Miss Jessie Smith of the Longfellow could
be assigned and still retain their classifi
cation.
There are five or six vacant classrooms
at the Franklin Grammar to which the
classes at the Stanford School could ho
assigned, and the rest provided for at the
Starr King. Should the Longfellow School
be done away with the Whittler cou'.d
take 250 pupils and three classes could be
Installed In the Rincon. As the Rinccn
adjoins the Longfellow some classes
might be left in the latter school under
the supervision of the Rincon principal
Either plan is regarded as perfectly
feasible, and while no teachers would lose
their positions if the rule of seniority of
service is carried out. it might have the
effect of placing one or two on the substi
tute list. While the School Directors dis
claim any intention to abolish any school
at the present time, it Is understood that
the plan will be ultimately adopted as a
matter of expediency.

USES SOCKS AS
A MEDIUM TO
FLEECE WIDOWS
Crook Plies His Trade
in the Potrero.
A crook whose education in his chosen
line has evidently not been neglected,
and who, garbed as a "slave of the wheel
of labor," has learned that proper manip
ulation through the undignified medium
of various pairs of socks leads on to for
tune, has been "working" the widow
storekeepers of the Potrero and South
San Francisco during the past few weeks
In an old but clever way. The criminal
in the case, who is described as a man of
middle life, garbed as though his only
calling in life was that of an Iron
worker, made his appearance In 'the Po
trero last week. He appeared In the
store kept by Mrs. Getchel at 612 eight
eenth street and proceeded to unfold a
tale. He said that he was in need of a
pair oÂ£ socks, as his wife was absent and
no on.? was near to darn those worn with
use. Mrs. Getchel placed in his hands for
examination a pair valued at 25 cents. Ho
said that he would take them and they
were wrapped up. In payment the crook
handed Mrs. Getchel a $5 gold piece.
The Sock Flim-Flam.
He was given the socks and his change
â $4 75. After examining other goods on
display the unknown criminal walked to
the door. On reaching it he hesitated a
minute and then returned to the counter.
He said that after reflection he had be
dded to await the return of his wife,
who would mend his socks, and conse
quently he would return the pair already
purchased. He placed the socks on the
counter, received his $5 piece back, but
on reaching the door again decided that
he would take the . socks. Again they
were wrapped up; a coin, apparently the
same $5 gold piece, was thrown on the
counter, he received the change and left
the place In a rush. A subsequent exam
ination of the cash In the drawer devel
oped the fact that the crook had, on the
last occasion, passed a gilded 1-cent
piece and had received the change for $5.
As the first coin placed by him on the
counter was In fact a $5 piece the coin
dropped on the second occasion escaped
examination by the storekeeper, who was
of opinion that the same coin was twice
placed before her for charge. After she
discovered the deception tliat had been
practiced on her Mrs. Getchel made In
quiries and found that the same trick
had been successfully worked on other
parties In the neighborhood. Mrs. Getchel
reported the matter to the police and an
effort to locate the confidence operator
is now being made. Many people in the
Potrero have very vivid recollections of
the appearance of the crook, but It is
safe to say that he has by this time
sought new fields in which the story of
his misdeeds and special way of working
has not yet penetrated.
giant trees of Calaveras have lost no time
In forwarding- the good work. On the 13ch
of January, during the work of club fed
eration in Los Angeles, Mrs. Lovell White
for the first time heard of the proposed
sale of the Calaveras grove. Immediately
Mrs. White notified the members of the
California Club and the ladles at once
started In to try and save the forest for
the State. Mr 3. Judge Murphy wrote to
Representative Julius Kahn, and Kahn in
terested Congressman Marion de Vrlos.
Then Mrs. Lovell "White wrote to Mrs. A.
D. Sharon, a prominent California Club
woman at present in Washington, an<l
Mrs. Sharon enlisted the sympathy of
Senator Perkins. On the 17th of this monih
De Vrles introduced a bill in the Houne
for the condemnation of the park, and on
the following day Senator Perkins pre
sented a similar bill to the Senate. A del
egation of California club women also
called upon Senator-elect Bard during his
one-day stay in town and obtained from
him the promise of his earnest support In
the matter.
Influence Is Brought to Bear.
The preservation of the Calaveras grove
row rests with the national authorities,
and the work of the California Club
women at present Is along the line of se
curing all the influence they can to bear
upon the lawmakers. Everybody who has
a friend in Washington is being appealed
to. Letters galore have gone on to both
Senators and Congressmen. Even the
President has not been spared, and per-
Eonal friends of the chief executive have
written him for his support in the matter.
Club Appeals to the Public.
On Saturday the club sent out the fol
lowing copy of resolutions:
CALIFORNIA CLUB.
San Francisco. Feb. 17, 1900.
Resolutions urging the purchase of the Cala
veras biff trees of California by the Federal
Government:
The Calaveraa Grove of sequoias. Included
In a tract of foreat land covering about 2300
acres, comprises 1450 trees of a genus found
at the present day only In California. Some
of these tree* are reputed to be 6000 years old
and upward, and their size and height war
rant this belief.
Whereas, A lumber merchant has secured for
$1000 an option of purchase on this tract of
land, expiring April 1, 1SO0; and.
Whereas, This grove, unDaralleled In the
size and magnificence of Its trees, is one of
the rreat natural attractions of the world;
Resolved, That In view of these facts the
California Club protests against the destruc
tion of these trees and beseeches Concress to
purchaw? and set aside this prove as a national
park, and it urges upon all citizens, all or
ganizations and legislators, both State and
national, to Join In commending and further
ing this course of action.
MRS. I-OVELi. WHITE, President.
Citizens Ready to Co-operate.
Yesterday 7000 signatures came In re
sponse to the club's appeal and they em
braced the entire personnel of the Mer
chants' Association, Stanford University
and the Pioneer Association. These reso
lutions are to be distributed throughout
the State, and when the signatures have
reached a sufficiently startling numbtr
they are to be forwarded to Washington.
The most the ladles expect as the result
of their labors Is that Congress will make
the sale of the grove Impossible. Their
next step will be to get the State Legis
lature to take. the matter in hand, to the
end that the giant sequoias become the
State's property.

5It would be interesting to know by what process ot

hysterical antagonism to fulsome adulation. Can it
be possible that the business office is responsible?
A$ a perpetrator and model of modern piracy the

MR. OLNEY ONCE MORE
OF all the rainbow chasers of our time none are
more persistent in their chasing, or are more
subject to illusory rainbows, than that
class of people who call themselves "conservative
Democrats." The object of their pursuit in chasing
the rainbows that shine in upon their imaginations is
to get away from Bryan. Every time they sec any
thing that glitters in the upper air, or along the dis
tant horizon, they think it a sign from heaven that
Bryanism shall be no mere, and rush toward *it with
all the devotion of a fanatic's zeal.
If anything in Democratic politics can be ac
counted as sure, the renomination of Bryan. by the
national convention of the party this year is that thing.
Time and agnin efforts have been made to raise new is
sues for the party or to find new leaders. The men who
have engaged in such efforts have not been lacking in
political astuteness. To that end Hill and Tammany
have combined in New York, Gorman has lent his
aid in Maryland, and many an influential Southerner
has co-operated; but all efforts have been in vain.
Still the delusive hope survives, and works so po
tently upon the minds that cherish it that now at this
late day it paints another rainbow on the political
sky. The ardent conservatives are persuaded they
perceive a movement in the West for the nomination
of Olney.
Had the Olney rainbow appeared in New England
it would have been a not unreasonable vision: or had
the western glow shown the face of some other con
servative there would have been at least a seeming
reliability in it; but the sudden fancy of a movement
ii> the West for the nomination of Olney is something
like lunacy.
The fantastic vision, however, has its votaries
among persons who are capable of discussing it with
great gravity and decorum. Thus, for example, the
New York Post says Indiana is the center of the
movement for Olney's nomination, and proceeds to
moralize upon it thus: >
"Probably no such good fortune is in store for the
Democrats and the country as the nomination of

WHY NOT A LEAP YEARâ J. C. S..
Ryde, Cal. The reason that 1900 Is not a
leap year. Is because It is one of the one
hundredth years that cannot be divided
by 400 without a remainder. The rule Is
not that a hundredth year may be divided
by 4 without a remainder, but It applies
to such hundredth years as can be divided
by 400. It so happens that the leap years
coincide with the years that are at visible
by 4, and thus they are known. Of the
years concluding centuries and known as
hundredth yearsâ c. g., 1800, 1900â only
every fourth . is a leap year, beginning
with 2000â1. c., only those divisible by 400
(c. g., 2000. 2400 2800, etc.).. The .reason for
this Is that the year la not exactly 363
days, but there Is a matter of eleven sec
onds a year which Is aggregated once in
four hundred years to strike a balance
and when the Gregorian calendar was ar
ranged It wan decided that the extra day
which would fall In the hundredth years
that could not be divided by -400 should
be dropped and that year should not be a
leap year, so as to bring about the equal
ization.

LUMBERING THE CALAVERAS TREES
WHAT has been known as the Calaveras grove
of big trees, the Sequoia gigantea, is about to
be lumbered.
This was the first group of the big trees discovered
in California. â¢ Nearly fifty years ago the measure
ment of individual trees in that grove aroused the
world's wonder and curiosity.
Long ago these trees passed into private owner
ship and have been one of the standard show places of
the State, on one of the routes to the Yosemite.
We believe that all the other well known groups of
the big Sequoias have been protected by being made
Federal reservations. Besides the intrinsic interest in
the trees themselves, this Calaveras group is of his
toric value, derived from being the first that was dis
covered, and therefore the subject of the first discus
sion among botanists and dendrologists, ard the
cause of the first controversy over the name that
should be given to that variety of forest giants. The
English botanists attempted to fasten "Wellingtonia"'
as their designation, and the Americans countered
with "Washingtonia." We believe, however, that
Sequoia gigantea has come to be the accepted clas
sical name, in distinction from the near congeners
found on this coast and in Japan, the ordinary red
wood of commerce, the Sequoia sempervirens.
This group, to which so much interest attaches, has
been bonded for sale to a lumberman from Duluth,
Minn., who has acquired also a large tract of forest
land in the same region, covered with yellow and
sugar pine, cedar and other valuable lumber and tim
ber trees. This lumberman is without sentiment in
the matter, and to him the big trees mean so much
value in board measure, and he will fell and scale
them as his own, and their glory will be quenched
in rustic, shakes and shingles, as if they were not the
aristocrats of the forest. They are very old. The
birds were singing in their foliage when the Jews
were unable to sing the songs of Zion in captivity
and their harps were silent by the waters of Babylon.
But they are worth no more for lumber on that ac
count.
A worthy movement has been started in this city
to save them from the, saw. The ladies of the Cali
fornia Club have instituted measures to that end and
are influencing the Federal Government to interfere.
Resolutions have been introduced in both branches
cf Congress directing the Secretary of the Interior to
negotiate for the purchase of the grove as a Federal
reservation. But Congress must make an appropria
tion for that purpose, and that means a very deliber
ate proceeding, if it be accomplished at all. The
giove is outside the lines of the existing forest reser
vations, and its administration by the Federal Gov
ernment would require a separate establishment.
However. Federal processes may well be used to ar :
rest and hold the matter where it is for a few months.
If the resolution of direction to the Secretary of the
Interior pass, he may authorize the institution of
proceedings to condemn the property for a public
use. and this proceeding, perhaps without an appro
priation, might hold the grove until the Legislature
meets next winter, when the State could assume the
matter by consent of Congress and buy the property
as a State park.
This occurs to us as the easiest and most feasible
way to save those priceless trees from destruction.
The ladies of the California Club will have the sup
port of the Sierra Club, the Waters and Forests So
ciety, the State Board of Trade and all other organi
zations in the State which have an economic or sen
timental interest in the matter. It is evident that in
a public sense the only present resort is to Congress.
That failing, recourse may be had to our own people,
to get the money advanced to buy the option held by
the enterprising gentleman from Duluth, and await
the action of the Legislature. It seems incredible
that the destruction of the grove should be permitted,
but it 3S in private ownership, and the 'owner may
do what he will with it. independent of all public
authority, unless proceedings are begun to condemn
his private property for a public use. There is as
surance that the owner, who has given the lumberman
an option, is in sympathy with efforts to preserve the
grove, but his sympathy is one thing and his neces
sities quite another. It is said that he has made some
endeavor heretofore to pass the trees to public own
ership for public use. It is to be regretted that he
did not make his wish in the matter known to some,
one of the organizations now interested in the sub
ject, for it is certain that they would .at once have
taken up the matter and avoided this crisis, which
finds them in such difficulties as surround the appeal
to Congress and the risk of waiting for the Legisla
ture.
Richard Olney for President in opposition to Mr.
McKinley. This would. call the party back to its best
traditions of public policy and private character and
ability in its official personnel and would promise the
Republicans, in the campaign and in their future ad
ministration, the healthful stimulus of enlightened and
patriotic. opposition, as to methods and details, on
common ground of settled economic principles and
loyalty to indisputable national duties and interests.
The Democratic party will have to Â¦ endure further
chastening under Bryan before it will be 'fit for such
leadership as Olney's. But the mere talk of him,
especially in the West, is a sign of comfort."
If the mere talk_of Olney in Indianapolis be com
forting, then comfort is so cheap no one need grudge
it to'those who are content to receive it in that shap;.
In the meantime Bryan continues to do the talking
for the' party and apparently no one is doing the
thinking. Between the blind Bryanites on the one
side and the dreaming rainbow chasers, on the other,
the poor old Democratic donkey has but a slight
chance to escape being driven into the ditch at every
turn of the road.

TAXATION OF TELEPHONES.
DESPITE the ill success which has thus far at
tended all efforts on the part of the Super
visors to compel the telephone corporations to
I ay a just share of municipal taxes, there is every
reason for believing the new ordinance introduced by
Supervisor McCarthy on Monday will prove effec
tive. It is baÂ«ed upon an ordinance adopted by the
municipal authorities of Ogden. which has stood the
test of the law of Utah and been approved by the
appellate com. It has therefore the advantage of a
tirong precedent in its favor, and will doubtless be
iJstaincd by California tribunals.
In its nature the ordinance is simple. It provides
that it shall be unlawful for any person, company or
corporation to operate and maintain in the city and
county of San Francisco any telephone instrument
for which a rental charge is made without first ob
taining a licence for each instrument; that for each
hcenÂ«e there shall be paid quarterly the sum of =o
cents: that it shall be the duty of all persons, com
panies or corporations operating and maintaining
telephones in the city and county to furnish quarterly
t(Â« the Tax Collector a complete liÂ«t of all instru
ments in use, with the names and locations of persons
renting; them: and, finally, that a violation of the
c?dinar.ce shall be punished by a fine not exceeding
$;oo or imprisonment not exceeding ioo days or
both ' ' '
Such an ordinance will doubtless prove valid, and
its enforcement will not be difficult. The license im
posed is not heavy, and it cannot be charged that any
unjust burden has been imposed upon the telephone
corporation*. There remains, however, another fea
ture of the case to be taken into consideration. The
Pacific Telephone Company, through one of its offi
cials, has given public notice that the tax imposed by
the municipality will be added to the charges made
by the company upon the public. "We will put it in
the bil!." said the official, "and then there will hxt
some lively kicking." That announcement not only
shows the character of the corporation with which
the public has to deal, but also makes clear the next
step which must be taken in guarding the rights of the
,As the charter reads now, the municipal authorities
have no power to*regu!ate telephone corporations.
The defect was caused by a clever trick on the part
cf the corporation, and must be remedied at once. Ir
will be of little avail to impose a tax upon the cor
porations if they have the power to shirk the tax by
shifting it upon the public. The charter must be
amended at once, and the Supervisors should make
provision for calling an election for that purpose
without delay. The amendment should be adopted in
time for submission to the Legislature for ratification
next winter. Tha? is the issue at present, and it is to
be expected the Supervisors will act promptly upon it.

Notes.
Freight rates have been advancing
steadily for weeks past and yesterday
they reached a figure which has not been
touched since August, ISS7. At that time
James G. Fair was in the middle or his
big wheat deal and every vessel that
could carry grain was being chartered.
William Dresbach was then acting as
agent for the Fair syndicate. He char
tered the British wooden ship County of
Yarmouth for 41s 3d per ton. it was never
paid, however, as the bubble burst and
the vessel was turned back to her own
ers, much to the disgust of Captain
Swanson, her master. Later the County
of Yarmouth was f^lad to accept 31a, at
which figure she loaded for Cork.
The big four-masted iron bark Reliance'
was yesterday chartered by Eppinger &
Co. at Us 3d and will begin loading for
England in a few days. There is no
question at all but what her clTarter will
stand, as the advance in rates is the re
sult of a steady growth in trade and a
consequent scarcity of ships. At the
present time there are only two disen
gaged vessels in portâ the rJritish bark
Caithness-shire, which arrived last Sun
day from Australia, and the German
bark Paul lsenberg, which arrived Mon
day from Honolulu. The Isenberg will
probably go back to the islands for a load
of sugar, but the Calthnesa-shire, being
a small and handler vessel than the Re
liance, will get an advance on the figure
patd that vessel. The County of lar
nniuth, which received 41s 3d In ISS7. was
2154 tons net and the Reliance, which re
ceived the same figure yesterday, is 245s
tons net burden.
The demand for ships has increased the
demand for men to man them, and in
consequence sailors are scarce. The
ships E. B. Sutton and St. Francis, which
will go from here to Honolulu to load su
gar tor New York, had to pay the men
?Â¦'til a month to the islands, an advance of
lo'a month. From the islands to New
York the rate will only be $2u a 'month,
but the chances are nearly all the men
will desert at Honolulu and new crews
will have to be shipped. The Crown of
Denmark had considerable trouble get
ting a crew and there Is a probability
that an advance in deepwater wages will
follow in a few weeks. Â¦
The bark S. C. Allen, barkentlne S. G.
Wilder and brig John D. Spreckels were
released from quarantine yesterday and
were taken to the sugar refinery.

Captain Barneson of the transport ser

He made a' thorough examination of the
naval transport Badger and will make a
rtport upon her to the Government.
Should she prove suitable the army au
thorities will purchase her from the navy
and use her as a dispatch boat between
here and Alaska. The navy has no more
use for her and as she is a good service
able boat the chances are she will be
transferred to the army.
William Doyle and Peter O'Brien were
locked up in the Harbor Police Station on

and then handcuffed them. As both had
slight scalp wounds they were taken to

THE CZAR AND THE FINNS.
WHEN .the Czar rested from his labors for the
pacification of Europe and the disarming of the
nations, and found recreation in the easy pas
time of suppressing the independence of Finland, he
graciously conceded to the Finns permission to con
tinue their ancient Diet at Helsingfors, where their
delegates might meet, elect officers, debate and 'go
through the forms of parliamentary government.
That Diet has recently assembled, and the .peace
loving Czar has sent down, for the edification of the
members, a speech from the throne which would
hardly be unworthy of the Kaiser himself.
> The address begins with the statement: "I have
summoned you for the consideration of various
measures relative to the local conditions of the Grand
Duchy of Finland, the object of which is to promote
the well being of the country. Of late various mis
fortunes have occurred and a' portion of Finland has
suffered by a failure of the crops, resulting in : immi
gration on a considerable scale. I hope by means of
the measures before you, and with the aid of private
benevolence, to place the people in a position to en
dure the trials sent by ,God."
All of that sounds most excellent. There is a
marked change in the tone and sentiment of the im
perial speech, however, when it proceeds to set forth
the measures proposed for relief. The first proposi
tion-is that the Diet shall enact laws to prevent^tlie
emigration of agricultural laborers, and the second is
that steps shall be taken to put people having no
property in a position to acquire possession of land.
With that measure there is to be introduced into
Finland the tactics the Russians have employed else
where when seeking to destroy the ancient liberties of
a people. By promising to give persons without
property an opportunity to become land-owners, they
divide the oppressed people into hostile camps, ar
raying the landless against the landlords, thus pre
venting anything like unity of effort on behalf of lib
erty. It is a cunning trick in the statecraft of im
perialism, and costs the Russian Government noth
ing, for when once the class, antagonism has been
aroused the people have no leaders and the landlords
no followers, so neither party ever gets strong
enough to demand that the Government fulfill its
promises.
.The closing paragraph of the address is significant
of the change that has been brought about in the na
ture of the Diet, and shows it is no longer regarded
by the Government as an independent body. The
Czar says: "Opinions which are not connected with
the above questions, or do not concern questions of
general imperial interest, must not be brought up
for discussion in the Diet. Opinions of this kind
were uttered in the last Diet and aroused among the
people a depressing feeling of unrest for which there
was no ground. A repetition of this will raise doubt
as to whether the institution of the estates is com
patible with present conditions."
It is to the credit of Finland that even in this dark
hour she does not lack for men with courage suffi
cient to proclaim liberty in defiance of a foe so cun
ning and so strong. When the address from the
throne had been read the Marshal of the Province,
speaking in behalf of the nobles, declared the Finns
iegard self-government as a vital condition, and that
many were emigrating not to seek food, but to find
homes 'in a land of liberty. The Archbishop of Aba,
speaking for the clergy, warned the Czar: "Fate
changes quickly. The civilized nations soon turn
from empty megalomania and lust "of power to work
for truth and right, lest ruin come upon them. The
deeply longed for era of peace will appear when jus
tice has prevailed." The spokesman for the burghers
added the final word that illegal measures estranged
men and checked the development of nations, and
thru neither Russia nor Finland would profit any
thing by the measures proposed by the Government.
Thus the situation stands, and the Czar will doubtless
conclude .from the tone of the speakers that even a
Diet by sufferance is incompatible with present condi
tions.
A large and influential club has been organized for
the single purpose, of striving to benefit the entire
city. The members might wisely interest themselves
in coaching Mayor Phelan's infant class in city gov
ernment how to run the municipality out of debt
without making it a prey to night marauders.

DEATH OF A NOTED
PAINTER OF ANIMALS
William H. Beard, a Member of tlra
Academy, Succumbs to
'Apoplexy.
NEW YORK. Feb. 20.â William H.
P-card, the artist, died at 11:57 o'clock to
right. Mr. Beard'? death was due to
apoplexy. He had been ill since Januarj
Â£7. His condition changed for the worse
yesterday and he was unconscious for a
considerable time before hie death.
William H. Beard was famous as a
painter of animal?. He was born at
Palnesville. Ohio, in IS2J. He began his
professional career about lÂ£4t>. Ten years
later lie studied and painted in Europe.
His wife was the daughter of Thomas
Le Claire, the portrait painter. He was
elected a member cf the Academy in 1562.
preme Being? Says the Incarnate Lord .
mi, erro:
I am the origin and end
Of all this changeful universe.
Th*re la, O hero, naught bÂ«yondl
For all ia strung on Me atone.
As the beads upon the thread.
I am the freshness of the waters.
The splendor of the iun and moon.
The essence of the holy writ.
The sound of sounds, the man In mÂ«n.
I am the life of life. O prince.
All true devotion's centered power.
All beings' seed am I. the strength.
The wisdom of the strong and wise!
And how, then, are mortals to know
him? Says again the divine teacher (xll.
6(1):
Lo, those who worship 'Me alone,
Â« Committing all their acts -to Me.
Regarding Me their aim and end.
And thinking above all of Me,
Their hearts. O prince, do dwell in Me,
And I to them shall bÂ«, forsooth.

Thus the who<e teaching of the Bhaga
vad-Gltd. Is to fix our soul upon the Lord,
to the exclusion of all things tending to
draw us from him. Not that we should
neglect our duties in life, but that these
should be sanctified by recognizing all
blessings as faint rays of him "who is the
life of life, the splendor of the sun and
moon."
Our of Brahrranlsm grew Buddhism aa

pressed In Pali, a slater dialect of San
skrit. The sweetness of many of its
teachings may be Inferred from a few
quotations of the words attributed to
Buddha himself in one of the canons of
I3ud<3hiam. the Dhammapaden "Virtue's
Way," translated by Max Muller. "Sacred
Books of the East'):
Hatred is never conquered by hatred; hatred
Is conquered by love. â¢ %
Let man overcome anjer by love, let him
overcome evil by good; let him overcome the
greedy by liberality, the liar by truth.
As the vaasika plant sheds Its withered flow
ers, men should shed passion and hatred.
Him I call indeed a pious man who is tol
erant with the intolerant, mild with fault
finders and free from passion among the pas
sionate.

thousand men. and If another conquer iiimself.
he is the greatest of the conquerors.
But Hindu literature, though largely re
ligious and philosophical, is &J3O ia no
small degree secular, even if then usually
permeated by religious conceptions. The
lllnda possesses at least two gTeat epics,
of which one. the Mahabharata ("the
great Bharata War") Is the moat famous.
Thla huge epic of about 200.000 verse-llnea
describes the contest between two royal
families, both descendants of Bharata.
But being the production not of one man
but of sucessive ages, the chief narrative,
probably rooted in a simpler one of his
torical foundation, la Interwoven with nu
meious unalien episodes, breaking the
chain of events and filling by far the
larger part of the epic.
Lvrlc poetry also found rich expression
in Sanskrit. Among larger lyric poems of
recognized worth, the most celebrated is
MegbaDuta ("The Cloud Messenger."
translated by H. W. Wilson, London.
1814). This poem, composed by the great
dramatist Kalidasa, who is supposed to
have lived in the early part of the sixth
century. A. D.. is really overcharged with
striking poetic imagery.
Strange us it may seem. India la yet
more famed for its dramatic than for Its
lyric and epic poetry. Among the dra
matic poets Kalldasa, the author of "The
Cloud Messenger," stands foremost, and
"Shakuntala," the gem of Indian dramatic
composition, and one of the great world
poems. Is his masterpiece. .
When llrat made known to Europe
more than a century ago It was hailed
with expressions of unreserved admira
tion by the foremost literary men. Hum
boldt said that "Tenderness In the expres
sion of feelings and richness In creative
fancy have assigned Kalidasa his lofty
place among all poets of all nations."
Only some salient works of the Sanskrit
literature have been touched upon In this
necessarily brief sketch. They may suf
fice, however, to show that this literature,
among much that is valueless from an
esthetic point of view, also contains
works of no small merit. It may be true
that even the best Hindu poetry contains
elements that are at times offensive to
our esthetical taste; gorgeous colorings
to the neglect of finer shades, grotesque
leaps of Imagination and supernatural in
vention. But. after all. no literary work
of a remote time or a foreign civilization
can be appreciated without that degree of
general literary culture and broadness of
spirit which will enable us to discover
real beauty even through the veil of un
familiar ideas and associations. It may
be true also that our superior culture pro
vides for poetic forms that were beyond
the Hindu. As our knowledge ripens into
a better understanding of the secrets of
nature, of society and of religion, not only
our store of words but all kinds of ex
pression are wonderfully enriched. How
could the ancient Hindu, with his limi
tations, have framed a figure like Long
fellow's "The clock kept time with the
revolving spheres." or Colerldge'a "There
are errors which no wise man will treat
with rudeness while there Is a possibility
that they may be the refraction of some
great truth below the horizon?" But
where poetic expressions are suggested by
a more Immediate observation, by first
Impressions from external forms and or
dinary human conditions, the Indian muse
is. in her better moods, nowise unworthy
of her Western sister, besides having a
peculiar charm of her own. Perhaps In
all the wide world's literature there Is not
a womanly character more charming for
pure, delicate tenderness and devotion
than are Damayanti and Shakuntala.

GOLDEN AGES OF LPERATURE
11. LITERATTJBE OF INDIA.
BY A. H. EDGREX, PH. D. ' *
(University of Nebraska.)
India, rich and sunny India, has tcr
ages been the tattle ground of raors anÂ«l
the home of deep religious meditation^ and
literary activity.
It was once occupied entirely by that
dark-hued race which yet makes up the
bulk of Its population, especially In the
Bouth, where this race has even preserved
Its language. But about 4COO or 5000 years
agoâ seme claim much earlierâ a llsht
complexloned race penetrated Into the
peninsula from the north, gradually sub
duing and forcing ita language upon the
ancient Inhabitants. That language is yet
preserved in the early hymns sung t>j' the
Invaders when, occupying the river basin
of the Indus and In many later monuments
of a growing literature. Its Â«arly name,
possibly, was Aria, although this Is not
certain. But when one of its dialects,
coming to be the recognized idiom of the
higher classes and the vehicle of literary
composition, was brought under deili.ke
rules that idiom was called Sanskrit (sara-
Fkritft. perfect, holy) as distinguished
from the other so-called Prakrit dialects
(prakrita, common). It continued to be
the living Langi'age for many centuries,
until finally it was superseded by popular
j dialects. But It has never yielded its Â«r*vay
j as the language of learned intercourse in
India, being yet used as such.
j Sanskrit le of especial Interest to us for
j three reasons. In the first place it belongs
to that large family of languages, ordinar
ily called the Aryan or Indo-European,
which is spoken from India through al
most entire Persia, Armenia, Europe and
America, being thus akin to our own. in
the second place, representing by fat the
earliest phase of any Aryan dialect, it re
veals on the whole more"'fa!thfillly than
any of them that early growth of the Ar
yan language by composition and internal
j change which has later been gradually
obscured and obliterated, not, indeed, by
| a process of decay, as some prefer to call
It. but by a process of fusion ever tend
ing to centered strength and simplicity.
Aside from its linguistic interest, the
transparency of Sanskrit, by revealing to
a large extent the metaphors hidden with
in the comportite forms of the language,
also lends a peculiar picturesquenese to Its
poetic expressions. In the third plaoo.
Sanskrit contains an abundant literature
of varied historical, philosophical an i
esthetical interest.
The Rig-Veda ("Hymn- Veda," "Sac-e.I
Book of Hymns") is the oldest llurary
monument of Sanskrit and of the Aryan
speaking nations. It is a collection of
about a thousand hymns and lyrics som
â¢ posed during centuries and handed Jov.n
; by faithful tradition from the time tht
j Aryans stood on the threshold of India
: to the time they were collected into the
i hymn material we now possess. These
hymns, invoking the gods, extolling heroic
deeds and contemplating the mysteries at
existence, though rarely of a higher order,
are in part .full of life and charming ly
their naive and objective simplicity, but
also in part utterly trivial and uninterest
ing. They show the invaders to have been
a vigorous semi-barbaric people, loving
life and Ita enjoyments, but also imbued
with those deeply religious tendencies
, which later took such a prodigious devel
opment, leading to the loftiest specula
tions on the' one hand and to the most
degrading superstitions on the other.
Their religious conceptions were based on
nature worshipl Struck with wonder anJ
awe by the mysterious phenomena of na
ture, they conceived behind them llvin?
powers, which, being personified, became
their gods.
The beaming sun (Surya, akin to T-atln
Sol) was Joyfully hailed by the slngor
(i, CO-42):
The mornlnft rays already brlns
The mUhty Surya, heaven's god.
For every being to behold.
And 1Â«! the stars up yonder steal
Like thieves away, and hide their beams
Before the luna all-searching eye.
The same prosperity us grant.
Thou wise and wonder-working god.
That once thou didst our fathers grant!
Help ua to conquer our foes.
Make smooth and easy our path.
Life-bringerl grant us vital strength!
The rosy dawn (Ush-as-Aur-ora) was
affectionately invoked:
Thy path is beautiful above the mountains.
Thy glow through clouds suffusing all the sky.
Bring, heavenly daughter, mighty Dawn, en
throned
In the broad east, us nourishment abundant.
O Dawn, approaching with thy seeds tri
umphant.
Bring us the riches that we do desire.
In early morn, already, heavenly daughter,
Thou comest richly laden like a goddess.
But more than anything the peal and
flash of thunder stirred the soul of the
beholder. That was the mighty Indra
(the cloud-compelling Zeus of the Greeks,
the Thor of the Scandinavian.^ crushing
with hissing bolts the cloud demoft and
his dark cloud cavern, thus compelling
the downpour of abundant showers, and
drinking strength for his deeds out of the
exhilarating soma juice prepared by the
invoker (11, 32):
Now will I praise the heroic deeds of Indra.
The deeds that once the lightning-armed ac
complished.
He slew the dragon, set the waters flowing
And burst the caverns of the clouds asunder.
With hissing bolts, by Tvashtar fashioned for
him.
He slew the dragon stretched upon the cloud
banks;
And suddenly, like lowing klne, the torrents
Poured gushing down into the mighty ocean.
And eager like a bull he sought the soma
And quaffed three pallfuls of its ft>ry juices.
Then grasped the mighty god again his weapon
And slew the brood, the firstborn of the
dragon.
To propitiate the gods the singing of
these hymns was early accompanied by
simple sacrificial ceremonies. which
gradually became ever more complicated.
And around them grew up a priestly
caste, the Brnhmans (originally brahman,
"performer of the prayer," from brah
man, "prayer"), whose influence deeply
affected the destinies of India:
Such were the beginnings of the Brah
manical religion. More than a thousand
years of speculation, expressed In numer
ous theological and philosophical works,
are included in the Brahmanic literature,
gradually evolving out of early polythe
ism the conception of one universal
power, finally merging Into pantheism.
The germs of a uniting conception may be
traced already in some of the Vedic
hymns. But it found full expression only
in much later workH. especially In the so
called Upanishads ("Teachings.") To the
speculative Hindu the material world was
then but an emanation of the spiritual. It
had come from the Supreme Soul (At
man) "as the wave of the river from its
source." "as the spark from the flame."
and it was destined once to return unto
it. Man when cleansed from the slime of
Ignorance was to be reunited with the
Eternal Soul. Until then he was con
stantly reborn Into the material world to
begin a new existence varying. from the
very lowest to the highest.
Except in their coarsest form these uni
tary conceptions never reached the
masses. To them the gods with various
substitutes and metamorphoses continued
to exist, while even in ordinary literature
they kept their place without reference to
the exact belief of the author.
The ripened Hindu philosophy found a
beautiful expression in the Bhagavad-
Glta ("The Lord's Lay," rendered Into
prose by Chatterjl: Houghton, Mifflln A
Co.. 1892). This work occupies a high
place among the Branmanic scriptures,
and has been a great influence upon the
spiritual life of the Hindus. It represents
the teachings of God Incarnate to a hu
man prince. The object of life, he says,
is the attainment of true knowledge,
which is a beatific vision of the Supreme
Being. Having known even Him. man
attains to deathlessness. There Is no other
way (Cf. the Scriptures, "And this Is life
eternal, that they might -know Thee, the
only true God," etc.) Those who do not
gain such knowledge remain fettered to
material existence by repeated births and
deaths. But who. then, is He, that Su-
Common whfoky is a curseâ the Old
Government Is a blessing. â¢

7CHICAGO, Feb. 20.â A1l the strength which
characterized the close in wheat yesterday had
disappeared before the opening of regular trad
ing to-day. Early cables were a disappoint
ment, showing but a slight response at the
opening to the advance here yesterday and
even this soon disappeared. Besides this the
cash demand was exceedingly light. Shortly
after the opening a realizing movement de
veloped and Belling pressure from this source
was soon increased by weakness in corn, the
result being a material decline from yester
day's closing figures. The liquidating move
ment was of short duration and the demand
not improving trading became dull almost to
stagnation, remaining so almost to the close,
with prices In narrow range. Some improve
ment in tone was creafWl by the decrease In
the world's visible supply where an increase
was expected by most traders, but no really
important buying followed the posting of the
figures. The Southwest reported a good cash
demand, with farmers hauling to market on a
large scale.. May wheat opened at 68%e. a de
cline of %@Â»4c. sold at 68% c declined to
67%Q67;4c and closed %@%c lower at 68c.
There -was a broad and active market for
corn, prices changing rapidly, though trade was
not wide. On a decline a good speculative de
mand developed and ultimately part of the
decline was recovered, the market closing
fairly steady after showing considerable ner
vousness at times. May closed %(fi H-c lower
at 35% c. *
Oats were dull and weak. Independent feat
ures were lacking, the market ruling fraction
ally lower all day. May closed HSVic lower
at 23% c. . ' .
A fairly good trade was done in provisions.
Early In the day prices declined somewhat In
sympathy with lower yard prices for ho^s and
liberal receipts, pork especially showing weak
ness under short selling. . Later in the session
the Improved tone In corn helped . provisions
and prices recovered the early loss. May pork
closed a shade lower. May lard unchanged and
May ribs 2%c higher. Â¦

Nczv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 20. â Speculative opinion
ehowed itself to-day rather unsettled and
doubtful as reflected by the operations of pro
fessional traders. The news of the day so
fas as It affected values of securities was all
favorable, but It failed to attract any de
mand for stocks from the general public. This
Induced a rplrlt cf caution among professional
operators about taking on large lines of stocks
In view of the doubtful market afforded for
realizii:fc. The bears were Inclined to make
c.vertutes. encouraged by this doubtful spirit.
Hut while they eucceÂ«^Jed In forcing large de
clines in a few special stocks they failed to
Induce any general liquidation. The under
tone of the market was distinctly firm and the
opening gains which were pretty generally
wiped out mere largely recovered again In the
final dealings. London was disposed to buy
stocks here and while the volume of the buy
ing was not Important the tendency was con
sidered to be so in view of the condition of
the exchange market and the approaching loan
for war purposes to be placed by the Hrltlxh
Government. The tendency of railroad *tockÂ»
Tran upward at the start and there waÂ« special
strength where reports showed a. high level
of earnings. Southern Railway was the most
notable addition to-day to the large gains for
the second week In February, Its Increase over
last year's similar period being no less than
45 per cent. The Southern group generally
ehowed the benefit of this Increase. LaÂ»t
week's east-bound shipment* from Chicago
eclipsed all previous records and stlmulotel
the railway stocks generally. The annual re
port of the Delaware, Lackawanna and West
ern gave an impetus to the anthracite group.
In which Reading first preferred led, Laika
wanna itself yielding on realizing. The nÂ«t
rwsult of the year's operations for this roaa
was a surplus after dividends of J1. 607,171
sgalnst a denclt last year of 1&05.73 C. This re
sult was achieved In spite of the large de
crease in gross earnings (no less than half
of which is due to the decline In ths returns
for transportation of coal) by a cutting down
of the cost of confluctlng transportation of
over $2,000,000. And In the miscellaneous in
come the earnings from the coal departmtnt
were increased some $2,630,266. The weakness
of Third Avenue, which fell an extreme â¬%
<ex-d!\ldend). and of People's Gas, which loÂ»t
1%, were the unsettling Influences In the
market. The late strength in the coalers and
a sudden rli-e of 2% per cent In St. Louis and
Southwestern preferred Induced the late re
covery In prices, which reached the best-,
many cases. The call money continued easy,
but the rÂ»tÂ« of absorption of funds by the
rub-treasury, which has reached $2,357,000 since
last Friday, and the continued downward
course of New York exchange at Interior points
caused continued uneasiness over the money
filiation. Sterling exchange eased off a frac
tion la ruponee to a slightly culer ton* 'lor

Dried Fruit in Nra> York.
The New York Commercial says:
"Prunes are unchanged, but the aggregate
cf what has been called dull trade has been
quite satisfactory- *>"Â° buyer takes large lots.
all take a few. the result being that business
has progressed better than appearances indi
cated from day to day. The supply In all po
rltions is supposed to be moderate, but amply
sufifeient to till all requirements. No export
demand is noted, but that is expected later.
Everything in this market is firmly held and
the general tendency is upward rather than
downward.
â¢Raisins are quiet, attractlr.* very little at
tention from any one. The feeling In the trade
is one of confidence, however, and there are in
dications that everything available will be ex
hausted long before the new crop is ready to
harvest. Seeders are showing comparatively
Jittle Interest, but are keeping the situation
veil in hand and will buy where they can get
eurplies to best advantage.
â¢â¢Peaches sre unchanged, but the buying sea
t-m is approaching and the trade anticipates
actiw movement. The general conditions are
quite satisfactory and all supplies are held up
to Quotations, with confidence that buyers will
bave to pay the price asked. The supply in
firÂ«t hands is known to be closely controlled
and holders are said to be in position to exact
the last fraction in making sales.
"'Apricots are steady, but trade Is largely of
a retail character and confined to such orders
&s are needed to cover present consumptive
requirement*."

London Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 20.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were very slack to-day be
cause of the end of the account, but the tone
was distinctly cheerful and the close was at the
best, although the news of General Buller's oc
cupation of Colenso was not known before the
end of the session. Paris was strong, but Ber
lin ceased to take any hand in the dealings.
Americans opened well above parity, London
buying more briskly than it has done for con
siderable time. The favorites were Norfolk and
Western and Louisville and Nashville. The
close was about the top on New York support.
The bank bought Â£9000 gold In German coin
and Â£SOOO in bars, and Â£50.000 came in from
Denmark. The Cape took Â£10.000. It is sur
mised that yesterday's sale of gold was a loan
transaction. Call loans were in good demand,
but the bank did less In loans. Fixtures were
strong and bills were steady. *

tens. This Is a very smatl quantity of colonial
coal to be delivered here in. thirty days, and
the list of all possible . deliveries to be made
here in the next sixty days does not foot up
13,000 tons. Last year at this time coal freights
from Newcastle were ' 4 shillings per. ton less
than they are to-day, yet there were then
eleven more vessels loading there for San
Francisco than now. The colonial product has
ceased to be a fuel factor In this market, as
90 per cent of our demands are now satisfied
by our coast colliers and they are getting their
properties in such shape that they will retain
their supremacy if they can. It Is most singu
lar, the commercial mutations within twelve
months. Outward grain . freights are to-day 10
shillings per ton higher here than Just one
year ago and coal freights 4 shillings higher,
a combined difference of 14 shillings per ton
In favor of the carrier, yet but few are pro
curable.. While the . demand â¢ for the Hawaiian
Islands continues unabated ' the San Francisco
receipts will naturally remain light, whence the
outlook for cheap fuel this year Is, not very
promising, as the coast products will. assuredly

MINI COMPANY
SUED FOR FRAUD
Many Victims Bought
Worthless Stock.
Special Dispatch to Tbs Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 20.â The scandal which
has been slowly gathering about the af
fairs of the Golden Crown Mining Com
pany will be aired In court. To-day R. J.
Johnson began suit against E. H. "Wem
ple, the treasurer and head of the com
pany, to recover a promissory note for
$4000, which he alleges the defendant had
fraudulently obtained. The complainant
recites that on August 10, IS9B. he pur
chased 4000 shares of the Golden Crown
mining stock from Wemple, giving a *4000
promissory note in payment therefor. The
note was secured by a beneficiary interest
In thirty acres of Improved land In the
May wood colony, Tehama County, valued
at iSOOO. Johnson states that he waa in
duced to buy the mining stock through,
false and fraudulent statements of Wem
ple and W. O. Hllblsh. who issued a
prospectus In June. 1593. At that time the
company owned six quartz claims in Mar
iposa County, the leading property being
the Big Betsy mine. The prospectus stat
ed work had been commenced and that
assays had shown the ore to run from $173
to $200 per ton and the supply was almost
limitless. As a further bait to Investors
it said "one dollar invested now may be
worth one hundred in a year."
In December last Johson learned that
his stock waa worthless and he accused
Wemple of having cheated him. The
complaint recites that Wemple admitted
the mine waa worthless and said com
pany had ceased work on the claims.
Johnson asks for the return of his $4000
promissory note and that the transac
tion be set aside on the ground of fraud.
The suit filed to-day Is probably the
forerunner of dozens of others. During
the last three years the Golden Crown
Mining Company did a thriving busl
ines*. The workina: classes bought heav
ily of the stock. It Is said that at least
$100,000 went into the treasury of the
company from residents of this city. Tho
mine was advertised all over the East,
and considerable money was received
from people there. The fact that Wem
ple, who Is a large grocer, was at tho
head of It added respectability to th-j
concern and caused many people to in
vest. There are an unusually large num
ber of victims among the teachers In the
School Department. Until recently
Wemple was chairman of the City Board
of Education, and In hopes of currying
favor with him many of the lady teach
ers put all their salary Into the mining
scheme*

DIVORCED COUPLE ARE
REUNITED IN COURTROOM
After & 'Xtong Separation, the Wife
Rejoins Her Husband at the '
Close of His Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 20.â The reunion of
a man and wife once loving, but who had
been separated by a decree of the divorce
courts, took, place in Judge Gardner's
courtroom this morning.
The husband was Robert Buchanan, on
trial for obtaining: money under false
pretenses. Among the spectators sat
his former wife. When the Jury returned
a verdict of "not guilty" the woman made
her way through the crowd to Buchan
an's Bide and when she left the court
room It was leaning on his arm.
A year ago Buchanan was discharged
from employment on the North Paclflo
Coast Railroad. The family became In
debted to the local stores. All the bills
were paid but one owed to H. A. Failey,
a dry goods man. One morning: Buchanan
left town, saying that he was going in
search of work. Months passed, but no
word reached Buchanan's family of his
whereabouts. At last Mrs. Buchanan,
acting mainly on the advice of friends,
sued for divorce on the ground of deÃer
tlon. She obtained the decree.
Recently Information reached here that
Buchanan was at Sacramento. Last week
he was brought here and has since been
in Jail. Mrs. Buchanan has frequently
visited him in his cell, and the scene in
court this morning was the culmination
of the love which has reasserted Its sway
over the divorced pair.

BULGARIA AND SERVIA
ON THE VERGE OF WAR
LONDQN, Feb. 21.â The Vienna corre
spondent of the Standard says: "Strange
rumors are afloat In Vienna and still
stranger things are undoubtedly occur
ring. Rumors point to impending hostil
ities between Bulgaria and Servla. There
is no doubt that both are massing troops
on the frontiers.
"It looks Impossible, however, that war
should occur, because neither country
possesses the necessary financial sinews
and neither Russia nor Austria would
sanction such an outbreak."

POSTUM CEBEAL.
PAYS MILLIONS
To Talk Health to the Public
A short time ago the advertising man-
ager of the Posturn Cereal Co., Ltd., at
Battle Creek, Mich., furnished this pa-
per with a statement as follows: "We
receive in some single months 1200 to
1500 letters from people explaining their
experience with coffee drinking, which
would interest any physician or any per-
son making the subject of health a study
(and that is really a very important sub-
ject for every one). Many of these letters
Rive the details of how the writer, hav-
ing been ill for months, and in some
cases for years, without discovering the
cause of illness, has finally been led to
fufpect that coffee (which is really a
drug) has been the cause, and in order
to prove for their own satisfaction, have
abandoned coffee and taken up Postum
Food Coffee, with remarkable results in
many cases.
The most common ailments from cof-
fee are headache, general nervous pros-
tration and stomach trouble. Many
times a blotchy complexion is the re-
sult, and a very large number speak of
serious kidney troubles that have been
set up. which disappear when coffee is
left off and Postum Food Coffee taken
in its place; but the range of disorders
to the human system is very wide, and
directly points to the effect of coffee on
the nervous system, which locates in
some one or more of the different or-
gans of the body.
It is plainly evident that any person
suffering from lung trouble, catarrh,
heart trouble, bowel complaint, pain in
the back of the head or at the top of the
fpinal column, female troubles, and a
wide range of difficulties will be surely
and permanently helped if coffee is left
out of the diet and Postum Food Cof-
fee taken up. The reason is as clearly
marked out as any plain conclusion
that the mind can reach, and is abso-
lutely proven by personal test. Coffee
is a distinct poison, to many people,
often slow and insidious, but sure.
Leaving it off will remove the cause of
the trouble, and, on the other hand, if
Postum Food CaQet is taken up, the
natural elements which exist in it. and
which are selected from the grains of
the field intended by Nature for rebuild-
ing the nervous system, will make
themselves shown in increased strength,
vitality and health.
We feel that we have a clear right to
tell these facts over and over again to
the public and to ask them "to make
trial for themselves, in order to prove
the truth of our statements." The sub-
ject is worth the attention of every one
interested in physical and mental
health.
CITY PRISON STAFF.

in Making Certain Changes,

grows with the play Just as it should and
the working out of the story to a genu
inely humorous climax Is legitimate and
consistent.
The first act of "The Prodigal Father"
is smilable; its mid-section is mirthy and
comic situations abound in its final di
vision. The farce is not only ingeniously
contrived, but the author (bless him;
makes his characters express themselves
exceedingly well.
Of the company Ernest Hastings does
not saunter through the play as is his
wont in fashion-plate parts, but acts with
spirit and graj?pn a great many of the
comic possibilities that are held out to
him. He might make more of his im
personation of the Cannibal King of the
Wamwams, but he does a capital black
face specialty as it is.
The "crushed tragedian" has been a
butt for 10, these many years, yet there
Is more than the ordinary allotment of
humor in the character of Catestoy Duff
and George Webster, who goes at it in
the right way, brings most of It out. His
work in so good as to be almost distin
guished. Mary Hampton, emotional act
ress, has a broad comedy part, wears
sporty clothen, unes slang and sings and
dances a few. In her "lignt-heavyweight"
way she acts with abanaon and seems to
enjoy It.
May Blayney. she of the delightful
voice and fascinating air of refinement,
shows little of the actress in an ingenue
part, and Laura Crews, whose charm
seems to be half in her lisp and half in
her unusual physiognomy, does nothing
very well. Jeffrey Williams proves more
dependable with each new character and
Howard Scott does one of his stereotype
stage prelates as the Rev. Smiles. Stan
ley Rom has evidently been taught to act,
but all he has learned he should forget
as Quickly as possible.
Considering all the difficulties of stock
company work the Alcazar has a very
worthy list of "capables," most of whom
are safely above the equator of medloc

A grand minstrel entertainment will be
given to-night in Native Sons' Hall, on
Mason street. In aid of the Seamen's
Catholic Institute. The benefit will be
under the Immediate direction of the
Paulist Fathers. Their object in giving
the entertainment is to attempt the liqui
dation of a debt of $400 that now encum

enough above this amount to establish
a complete library, a lecture-room, a
chapel and a gymnasium for the use of
seamen, irrespective of creed, color or
race.

auspices of which the Institute was estab
lished, found that It was Incapable of

COLLEGIATE
FIELD DAY IS
DECLARED OFF
Berkeley and Palo
Alto Clash.
BERKELEY, Feb. 20.â The annual
intercollegiate field day, which
next to the football game is the
greatest contest between the two
colleges, has been declared off un
less Berkeley or Stanford yields to points
which they refused this evening.
There was a meeting this evening be
tween Manager Cantwell of the Stanford
track team and Manager Decoto of the
University of California track team, which
broke up with the assertion upon the part
of Manager Cantwell that If the field day
was not held on the Stanford track that
It would not be held at all, to which Man
ager Decoto replied that it would not be
held at all.
The intercollegiate field day is usually
held in April of each year, and Manrger
CRntwell came, to Berkeley to-night to
confer with Manager. Decoto over the
place where the events should be held.
Last year the games took place on the
Berkeley campus, and previous to that
they had always taken place on the Olym
pic Club grounds in San Francisco. Man
ager Cantwell of Stanford astounded the
Berkleyites by demanding that the ga.me3
be held on the Stanford track.
Manager Decoto said that he saw no
reason why the games should not be
held at Berkeley, more particularly as a
great deal of money had been expended
upon the Berkeley track. But the Stan
ford man was obdurate. He stood for
the Stanford track or none. Then Man
ager Decoto asked that the games be
Bent to the Olympic Club grounds, as of
old, but again the Stanford man said
"No."
Finally Manager Decoto proposed a
peace conference and arbitration. He
asked that the matter be left in the
hands of an arbitration committee, to be
composed of Professor Richardson of
Stanford, Professor Bacon of Berkeley
and John Elliott of the Olympic Club.
This bade fair to succeed until Professor
Baqon was appealed to and refused to
serve.
Peace Conference Failed.
Then It was proposed that it be left to
Mr. Elliott as an arbitration committee
of one, but Mr. Elliott refused to serve.
Then Mr. Decoto proposed to leave it to
the Stanford University faculty .athletic
committee, but by this time It was
"Stanford or bust*' with the Stanford
manager, and with Mr. Decoto declaring
that It is "Bust" the matter stands.
This is the outcome of a long series of
wrangles between the two colleges over
this field day. When the programme of
events was arranged Berkeley suddenly
found that by adroit management the
100-yard, 220-yard and 440-yard dashes had
been made to follow each other. This pre
vented Drumm, the Berkeley champion,
who runs in all these races, from taking
part in all successfully and by tiring htm
out in the first race and bringing off the
others in quick succession would Injure
his chances. Berkeley fought this suc
cessfully and now Stanford has demanded
that the field day be held on their track.
Berkeley has demanded a $500 guarantee
in such an event, for the gate receipts at
Stanford would be small compared to
those in San Francisco or even In
Berkeley. , . ...
"It would be financial suicide to hold
the games at Stanford," said Manager
Decoto this evening, "yet they seem de
termined to force us to go there. It seems
to be the sentiment of the students here
that we have no field day rather than to
go to Stanford. The track at Stanford is
not as good as that at Berkeley or in
San Francisco. The gate receipts would
SLIGHT RAILROAD
ACCIDENT AT TRACY
STOCKTON, Feb., 20.â Thera was a
bloodless railroad accident at Tracy about
5 o'clock this morning. A Pullman sleep
ing-car was being switched from a Loa
Angeles passenger train to wait for an
other train. A freight train was Juat
pulling out of Tracy, and through a mis
understanding of the signals the Pullman
was struck by the freight and tipped oft
the track.
There was a brisk firs burning In the
sleepingcar stove, and the car would un
doubtedly have been ablaae In a few
minutes but for a patent device attached
to the stove which extinguished the lira
in it as soon as the car upset.
People came to the rescue of the Im
prisoned passengers, immediately llber
atrng them by breaking through the ends
of the car with axes. Only two of the
four passengers were found to have been
hurt.
One of them, a gentleman from Port
land, had his shoulder dislocated, and
the other, Tom Fitch Jr., of this city had
one of his knees sprained.
ALLEGED HORSE THIEF
SURRENDERS TO OFFICERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COVELO. Cal.. Feb. 20.â Walter Morri
son, better known an "Buzz" Morrison,
the young man charged with horse steal
ing and who has so successfully eluded
the pursuing officers for the past week by
hiding in the mountains, rode into town
to-day and surrendered himself to the
authorities. His defiant bearing about
town was attended with not a little ex
citement. Both town officials were still in
the mountains in search of the fugitive.
Morrison denies any direct connection
with the affair. In answer to a question
put by a Call representative as "to what
he knew of the theft he replied that a
half-breed Indian named William Swear
lnger stole the horse, sold It and got all
the proceeds of the unlawful sale him
self. Frank Shaw, a prominent rancher
and the owner, of the horse. Is the prose
cuting witness and asserts positively that
Morrison Is guilty.
Felix Garcia Passes Away.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 20.â Felix Garcia,
once one of the most prominent figures in
Marti County, died at his home here to
day. The deceased was over 85 years of
age. All his vast estates had vanishes
years before his demise and for Some
time previous to his death the county
had provided for him.
OAKLAND, Feb. 20.â 1f the prediction of Mme.
Emma Nevada comes true Mills College will
p roduce another songstress who will rank with
Nevada and Barna. When the prima donna
visited her alma mater some weeks ago she heard
Miss Beulah George of the class of '39 sing. The
strength and value of the voice at once struck the
great singer, and with a desire to add another star
to the vocal constellations she urged Miss George
to give up her life to song. She told the young lady
that there were qualities In her voice that made
success inevitable. That such notice should be given
a young and but partly trained voice Is a great
compliment, and It will probably result in forming
Miss George's future.

depth and clearness and a range suitable for oper
atic work. Her Interpretation is pronounced excel
lent. She is talented also as an elocutionist and

part. She 13 extravagantly fond of song and has for
her ambition In the musical world a development of

directed her studies toward sacred music. Her
voice is particularly adapted for this line of work.

HLAMEDA. Feb. 20.â 1t is the Intention of Miss
Edythe Parlser. whose singing in Alameda
II â Aand elsewhere has been favorably criticised, to
adopt the operatic stage as a profession. Her
instruction in vocalization is being directed by
Madame Rossi. Her voice Is of a sweet and pure
quality of yoprano, soft and pathetic. She has a
range sufficient for operatic work. When the opera
"lolanthe" was produced several months ago for the
benefit of E. D. Crandall Miss Pariser took the lead-
Ing role. Am lolanthe she scored a decided hit by her
fine interpretation of the music and intelligent act
ing of her part. She was one of the soloists in "The
Messiah," given by the choir of the Congregational
Church, and has eung soloa In many of the local
churches.

After recounting his troubles with the
trust, Rodd in his complaint say* that
he managed to secure copies of several
resolutions passed by the combine and
which were aimed at the dealers who re
fused to become members of the associa
tion. One resolution, which forms part of
the complaint, reads as follows:
Whereas. There are men that are Irresponsi
ble and an Injury to the stone business, and
are not eligible to thin association, from whom
the members of this association must be pro
tected; therefore be It
Resolved, That all members of this associa
tion will decline to employ any letterer, cutter

eoclatlon without first settin* the consent of
this association; and be it further
Revolved, That all members of this associa
tion notify all letterers, cutters and polishers
f this rule of the association.
Injure the Trade.
Another resolution passed by the asso
ciation, and which is also attached to the
complaint, reads as follows:
Whereas. There are so-called dealers who do
a vast injury to the trade as a whole, from the
Tact that they fail in jaylng their bills and are
thrreby enab'.ej to underbid the honest ones
that &o so, and to met this condition of things
It Is therefore
Resolved, and shall become a rule. That there
bÂ» a special committee appointed by the chair
annually end convlrtlnr of five members, and
to be called the "Rating Committee," and
whose office and duties shall be to take cog
r.lzance of such complaints as may be brought
to th^lr notice, and after careful investigation
a.r.d without prejudice submit their report of
fame, with their recommendations, at any reg
ular meeting of this association, and members
1 r vote in their regular form shall decide the
question whether such a dealer shall any longer
!â¢<Â» considered as worthy of being recognised
aÂ« a bona fide one, or no and by such decl
aim the wholesale dealers shall and must be
fctoverned.
Prays for Heavy Damages.
Rood also asks that the association be
disbanded and that the members be en
jolned from further conspiring and act
ir.g together to maintain rules and regu
lations and rates and prices whereby he
is prohibited from buying marble, gran
ite or sandstone or any of the articles
made or manufactured therefrom in the

From talk around the ring there will
be a scarcity of bookmakers next cut-in
at Tanforan.
W. B. Sink Jr, was very wrathy over
Rio Chico being, ordered scratched by
Starter Caldwell, and not without reason.
The action was taken on the absurd
grounds that the horse was a bad actor.
Then why was Anchored, a notoriously
fractious animal and one barred at Oak
land, allowed to go to the post? Rio Chlco
was allowed to start in hurdle events, get
ting away on each occasion, and only a
few days ago Mr. Sink said he had been
asked by an official of the club to start
his horse In a handicap for which he wan
entered. Other owners complain that
races are declared off simply because Cor
rlgan has no entry to make In them.

E. H. Ellsworth's Appeal to the Su
preme Court of No Avail.
E. H. Ellsworth, editor of a little paper
In Mendoclno County, shot and killed
Constable Dixon at the railroad station
at Montague in 1898. The editor had been
in trouble in the way of attaenment suits
and libel cases, and at the time of the
tragedy he and his wife were about to
visit this city. Ellsworth was a nervous
excitable man and he declared that he
would 1:111 any one who attempted to mo
lest him. "When Constable Dixan ap
peared at the station to serve upon him a
warrant for libel Ellsworth flred two
shots from a revolver that he aad con
cealed in his coat pocket, proiucln^
wounds that resulted ln the officer s death
a ff-w days later.
At the trial the defense set up the
plea of inÂ«anity and attempted to Intro
duce testimony as to events taking place
a lone time before the shooting. This the
trial Judge refused to allow to bd admit
ted, and after Ellsworth was lojnd
gu!lty of murder ln the second degre-j
the prisoner appealed to the Supreme
Court, setting up that the refmal of the
Judge to admit the testimony was a vital
error. Yesterday the Supreme Court
passed upon the matter and found that
no error, had been committed, which will
necessitate Ellsworth's stay for a tlm<j in
the State Prison-

SUSPECTED POOLROOM
FOR WOMEN RAIDED
Chief Sullivan was notified on Monday
afternoon that a number of women were
ln the habit of visiting room 10, 632 Market
street, and he Instructed Captain Splllane
to Investigate. Lieutenant Mooney and
Policemen McGrayan, Laws and Conlon
were detailed on the case, and when they
reached the room they found twenty
seven women there and two men. When
the women saw the officers there was the
wildest excitement, as they all Imagined
they were to be arrested.
The place was run by Jones & Johnson;
at least, these were the names they gave,
and they denied that they sold pools on
races, as was expected, saying they dealt
only In margins on the Eastern markets.
There was no evidence of poolselllng ob
tained to warrant any arrests, and after
taking a few names of the women, which
were all fictitious, the officers withdrew.
The Chief, however, ordered that the
place should be blockaded, and an officer
has been stationed there since.

The motion to appoint a committee was
seconded by Mr. Hennessey. In support
of the motion Mr. Bouvier remarked that
It was common report that some of the
members of the Congressional committees
ln the Fourth and Fifth districts had
been named by bosses outside of the con
vention. He thought it was time to in
quire why the county committee repre
senting the Republicans in these Congres
sional districts should not have a voice
ln forming the State and Congressional
District conventions. He expressed the
opinion that district commltteemen would
recognize the county committee.
The motion prevailed without a dissent
ing vote. The chair appointed J. C. Zel
lerbach, Lincoln D. McDonald and I. J.
Truman Jr. to act with Alfred Bouvier
and James A. Wilson in expressing tho
wishes of the county committee. The
executive committee adjourned to meet
at the call of the chairman.

CORRIGAN TEACHES THE
PUBLIC A COSTLY LESSON
Duped Horsemen Raise a Howl of Dismay
at the Track of Tanforan.
Four Races Deliberately Given to the Hawthorne
Gambler Without the Semblance of a
Contest
Â¦
IF the Western Turf Association
of Tanforan seeks to ruin the
California racing game its plans
are well laid. One or two days
more of sport like that of yester
day and a Maxim gun turned on the
betting ring would not kill over six layers
of odds iind twenty-three spectators.
Ilacts were framed to suit Corrigan's
bones with a nakedness that was shame
ful. When Caller McGibben announced
the result of the second event, won gal
loping by Geyser, the bookmakers, who
had been hoodwinked into thinking Zo
roasu-r would be a starter, jeered and
hooted at the result. It was a scene
never before witnessed in a California bet
ting ring. Chimura. Don Quixote and
Wailenstein. which also sported the colors
of Corrigran, were returned winners at
ridiculously short odds.
Such methods as these are not only dis
creditable and Injurious to legitimate rac
ing, but are criminal. Sure-thing gam
blurs would not resort to more dishonor
able scheming with which to fleece the
public and rob them in practically open
a.:id shameless effrontry. Four out of six
races were captured by Corrigan. not
through legitimate means, but by trickery.
The race? were arranged to suit Corri
gan's fancy. They were fixed to meet his
necessities. His horses were sent to the
barrier without competitors, possibly
winners being entered and then scratched
to deceive the public and the bookmakers
alike. One of Corrigan's horses cantered
In a winner by twelve lengths. The affair
would have been a farce had it not been
an outrage.
The nubile saw yesterday the explana
tion of why bo many men become dupes
of the racecourse as Corrigan understands
and manipulates the game. It Is not even
pambling. much less a legitimate sport ln
which s^peed and condition play important
parts. Corrlgun had the day to himseif
and Illustrated that the only privilege left
to the public is to lose its money through
a palpable fraud. An analysis of the rac
ing chart proves that yesterday Corrl
Â£an's horses did not compete in a single
race, ills horses won four prearranged
frauds for which the public paid the price
in their money and in a lesson in that ex
perience which proverbially costs a great
deal more than it is worth. Corrigan's
colors Hashing first under the winning
wire is the proof of another steal legal
ized by a truculent track management.
The historian of racecourse crimes and
i disasters, deaths and disgraces has con
fined.himself largely to the tragic stories
of the dishonor and death that has come
to clerks, cashiers and uninitiated dupes.
If this sort of thing continues despondent
suicidal horse owners will head the swell
ing list.
Boundlee, from Schreiber's stables, cap
tured his race, starting a 3 to 5 chance,
while Intrada, a second choice, took the
first number. '
A drizzling rain fell throughout the aft
ernoon, and enly a handful of people
journeyed down to the San Mateo County
course.
Corrigan's pair. Artena and Lily Simp
son, were Installed favorites for the two
year-old dash. Intrada, ridden by Bull
man, proved an easy winner, with ! On
Time downing Artena for place honors.
. A 1 to 4 choice, Geyser romped away
from Timemaker and Dr. Marks in the
Btretch. The first named horse gave the
winner a semblance of a contest for half
a rr.Ue, when he closed up and was beaten
twelve lengths.
Nine to twenty was laid against Chi
rnura winning the mile and a half run.
with only Tom Calvert and Anchored to
defeat. The mare won eased up, while
Calvert was hard ridden to get the place
by half a length.
Barney Schreiber's Boundlee outclassed
nls company in the fourth number. The
colt received heavy backing, and -after
petting away from the post none too well
led Genua out with pounds in reserve.
Mary Kinsella ren third.
Then followed the win of Corrigan's
Don Quixote, at six furlongs, ridden by
Spencer. Played fitsm threes down to 7 to
' S? wa - s sent off ln fr Â°nt. beating Tallac
a 20 to 1 shot, a neck on the wire. Tc r -

Corrigan's Wallensteln had nothing cap
able of riving him an argument in tha

before the extensively backed ones Mont

RIGHTS OF CITIZENS
MUST BE PROTECTED
Clash Between Police and Crowds at
Open- Air Meetings Benewed
and Two Arrests Made.
Storekeepers in the vicinity of Market
street and Grant avenue have been pro
testing to the police againEt the crowds
that congregate on the corners nightly,
a* they interfere with their business. On
Sunday night there was a Salvation Army
meeting on one corner, a meeting of so
cialists on the other, and a few yards
farther north a patent medicine vendor
was haranguing a crowd.
Policeman Kramer cleared the sidewalk,
but as soon as he got to another place the
crowd surged back, and finally Kramer
arrested J. D. Mardis for obstructing the
sidewalk. , A crowd followed the officer
and his prisoner to the patrol box and
Mardis characterized his arrest as an out
rage and asked if any citizen would back
him up. William Condon spoke up and
paid he would appear as a witness for
Mardis, and Kramer promptly arrested
him on the charge of interfering with an
officer. . â¢
The cases were called In Judge .Cabanls*
court yesterday. Mardis said he was
walking past the corner and halted just
for a moment to Bee what was going on
when the officer jostled him roughly and
told him to move on. To his astonish
ment he was grabbed by the collar be
cause he to*u the officer he was "too
quick," and was dragged to the patrol
box. Condon and other witnesses corrob
orated him and the Judge dismissed both
cases. Attorney Ryan, who represented
Mardis, wanted the Judge to rebuke the
officer, but the Judge replied that he was
not a police censor.

MYSTERIOUS SUICIDE
TOSSING IN THE SURF
JOHN JONES and Anthony Taronta, boys residing at 320 Vallejo street,
were on the beach at Lands End yesterday forenoon gathering ' sea
shells and saw the body of a man being tossed about in the heavy
surf that was breaking upon the sandy shore. One of them waded Into (
the breakers and tied a line to one of the wrists of the corpse and they hauled
It up on the sands out of reach of the waves' and notified the life-saving
station near by.
The body was that of a man of apparently. not. more than 30 years of age. .
five feet two or three inches tall, with, a bald forehead, clean-shaven face,
high cheek bones, small aquiline nose with prominent bridge and small (
mouth with thin lips. The eyes were gray or light blue. The deceased was
well dressed in a suit of black cassimere. light stockings and laced tan shoes.
An examination of the corpse at the Morgue disclosed a bullet wound in the
back of the head, between the top of the ears and the top of the skull. There ,
was also a bullet hole in the palate about an inch back of the front teeth.
This was evidently the point of entrance of the bullet, and the hole in the
skull was no doubt the point of exit. These wounds led to the belief that the
deceased committed suicide. From the . appearance of the corpse it was in
ferred that the body had been in the water not more than two or three days.
No person of the description of the dead man has been reported at the Morgue
as missing. There was nothing in the man's pockets that would indicate '
his identity, but his appearance is that of a man in fair circumstances
-An autopsy performed, last, night by Dr. Leland showed that the bullet '
had entered the palate and passed out through the back of -the head This
clearly establishes the theory of suicide, and it Is the. opinion' of the autopsy <
physician that -the man must have placed the muzzle of the gun some dis
tance inside his mouth. The fact that nothing which would give any clew (
as to the Identity of the suicide remains on the body goes to prove that he
made every preparation for the act. (
The pistol has not yet been found, but is supposed to have been covered
up by the sand, and a search will' be made for It. â¢ coverea <
