B. F. Lamborn Surprised the Senator in the
Woman's Apartments and Was Let Into
the Secret of the Marriage Contract.
O ENSATION follows sensation in the Craven-Fair litigation. On the very heels of Justice of the
Pcacc Simpton s somersault and Hat denial of his original story that he had performed a mar
riage ceremony bctzi-een the late Senator Fair and Mrs. Nettie Craven comes the announcement
that the woman is prepared to produce a witness who will testify that the dead millionaire zvas intro
duced to him by Mrs. Craven as her husband, upon which occasion the Senator admitted the cxistciicc
of the marriage contract. The new factor in the case is Ben F. Lamborn, City Clerk of Alameda, a
man of prominence and standing in the community. The attorneys for the Fair estate do not attack
his integrity, but claim that they will show, that he is mistaken in his assertions'.
Charles Pence, one of Mrs. Craven's attorneys, asserted yesterday that Simpton xvas bribed to
make the affidavit which caused such a surprise in the celebrated case. He claims to be able to prove
that Charles Fair induced Attorney Syha to influence the Justice to commit perjury, and says that he
will prosecute criminally every one who has attempted to interfere with the honest, free and' fair trial
of the Fair case.
He attempted to get Judge Hunt to issue an order for the attorneys for the estate to appear in
court last rjening and explain their connection with Simpton's latest affidavit, but the Judge refused to
meddle in the matter.

Lamborn offered his congratulations and
departed. He kept the secret until after
the death of Senator Fair and- the contest

asked by Mrs. Craven if he recalled the
incident,. as his testimony would be valu

matter had been Impressed upon his mind
very vividly and he readily agreed to go

strange to him. but it was not the vole

might be embarrassing to his hostess, he
hastened to excuse himself as soon as she
reappeared. Apparently she divined hid

Lambcrn promised not to-divulge .-â¢ what
had occurred or what was about to trans

throwing them open led Senator Fair into
the room. Lamborn says that a conver

place:

estate and is admitted by the counsel for
Mr*?. Craven. The information he claims
to possess concerning the relations said to
have existed between Mrs. Craven and
Fair, to all of which he is prepared to

SAY SIMPTON
WAS PAID TO
"FALL DOWN"
Agents of the Fair Estate Boldly
Accused of Tampering
With WL nesses*
The legal representatives of Mrs. Nettle
R. Craven are not In the least discon
certed over the sensational affidavit of
Justice of the Peace Simpton of Sausa
lito. They claim that the story of the
Sausallto ceremony is true and that Simp-
ton was paid to commit perjury when hÂ«
repudiated under oath the sworn state
ment he had made to them some months
ago. They further assert that Attorney
Sylva has been the traitor In their camp;
that he Daa been "playing both ends
against the middle," to use the sporting
phrase, and was the agent through whom
the honor of the Sausailto Judge was pros
tituted. . .. V -
Criminal prosecution of the principals

threats of proceeda.gs to disbar the at

Charles Pence, speaking for the firm oC
Pence & Pence of counsel for Mrs.
Craven, gave the version of the affair
which follows:
Sold Charges of Bribery.
"I will say without hesitation that
Slmpton was bribed to make the affidavit
which has produced such a sensation la
the Fair will case. As to whose money
bribed him I am not prepared to say now,
but when the proper time arrives we will
prove our assertions and name the guilty
f>arties. All that I can say at this time
n connection with this feature of the case
Is that Attorney Sylva Is the traitor who
acted as the agent for those who pur
chased Slmpton.
"I spent the better part of last night
trying to save the virtue of this witness
but failed. We have been the victims of
misplaced confidence, so far as Sylva Is
concerned. Up to Thursday evening ho
was aa loyal to us apparently as a man
could be. We placed faith In him and
have paid the penalty.
"As soon as the name of the Justice who
performed the ceremony was made public
Charles Fair kept the wires hot between,
his office and Sausallto until he located
Sylva and got him started to this city
on a private launch. "We heard that Sylva
went direct tc Fair's office, but to disa
buse our mind of any suspicion that he
was engaged in double dealing he told U3
that he had not gone to Fair's office, but
had met Fair and Joe Harvey at John

PRESSURE ON
KIMBERLEY HAS
BEEN REDUCED
LONDON. Feb. 16â9:30 p. m.â The fol
lowing dispatch from General Roberts
fills the gaps in the earlier dispatches:
"MODDER RIVER. Feb. 16.â The Sixth
Division left Waterfall Drift early yester
day morning and marched here, going on
the same evening to Reondeval Drift to
hold the crossing of the Modder River and
leave General French free to act. Shortly
after arriving here the mounted infantry
visited Jacobsdal and found it full of
women and children, with four of our
wounded men doing well.
"On the way back the mounted Infantry
were attacked and nine men were wound
ed. Colonel Henry and Major Hadhell
and ten men were missing. Both officers
were subsequently found at Jacobsdal,
slightly wounded.
"The cavalry division Is movlnsr In a
northerly direction and has apparently
already reduced the pressure on Kimber

has abandoned Alexandersfontein and
that he has occupied it.
"French has advanced as far as AbonsÂ«
dam with a slight loss and Is pushing
on the posts, his rear being held by
mounted infantry.
"Clementa having been pressed by the
Boers has retired to Arundel to cover
N'aauwpoort."
The War Office points out that the word
"here" In the foregoing dispatch means
some point on the Modder River, other
than Modder River station.
In an earlier dispatch General Roberts
reported:

General French Reports Having
Dispersed the Boers From the
Southern Side of Kimberley.
LONDON, Feb. 16.â The War Office 'has made public a
dispatch from Field Marshal Lord Roberts saying:
"Jacobsdal, Feb. 16. â The following from General
French was received this morning:
"I have completely dispersed the enemy from the southern
side of Kimberley, from Alexandersfontein to Oliphantsfontein,
and am now going to occupy their ground. Have captured the
enemy's laager and store supplies and supplies of ammunition.

LONDON. Feb. 17. 4:45 a.
m. â General Gronje, with a
start of a day or two, is
seemingly in full retreat from
Lord Roberts, moving north

cavalry, simply stayed over night
in Kimberley and then pushed
on to get in touch with the re
tiring enemy. A long Boer
wagon train is moving toward
Bloemfontein. followed presum
ably by a large force of British
infantry. In their hasty depart
ure the Boers lost quantities of
supplies and ammunition.
Military opinion here is that
Lord Roberts will not oush far
after the Boers immediately, be
cause of transport problems and
the need of rest for the troops.
He has to feed seventy thousand
persons in his army and the
whole Kimberley population. He
must rebuild the railway from
Modder River down to Kimber

General French lost a few men
only in action, but the forced
marches and heat have probably
made many ill. Numbers of re
mounts must be provided.

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1900.
The San Francisco CallAttorney Heggerty of Knight & Heg

that he had known of the alleged Slmp
ton conspiracy for the last five months,
and only wanted to ascertain how far
Mrs. Craven would go before they explod
ed the .whole story.
"There Is really nothing to be added to
the story as sot forth in Simpton's affi
davit." said Mr. Heggerty. "I understand
the other side Is claiming that we have
spirited Simpton out of the way. If they
really want to find him they will not have
much difficulty in locating him. He will
be like the hot potato of history, how
ever, for they will be mighty glad to let
go of him after they get him.
"The Sausalito marriage story is con
structed out of whole cloth. It Is an in
teresting fact that in all of Mrs. Craven's
previous testimony she never referred to
it, but always mentioned the contract

On the opening of Judge Troutfs court
yesterday morning Attorney Laf e Pence,
counsel for Mrs. Craven, appeared before
Judge Hunt, who presided in Judgo
Troutt's absence, and asked the court to
arrange for a night session in which to
consider what he believed to be rank per
jury committed by Judge Simpton of Sau

Mr. Pence said that it was evident from
the publication Of an affidavit made by
Simpton, in which' he denied that he per
formed the ceremony uniting James O.
Fair and Nettie R. ; Craven In marriage.
In the face of another affidavit In which
he swore Â¦ that he had performed such a
ceremony, that . Slmpton was guilty of
perjury and should be on the road to the
felon's home across the bay.
"This matter is of vital Importance,"
said Mr. Pence, "and In order that other
schemes by. which this. man may be al
lowed to escape the penalty for his mis
deeds may be prevented the court should
not delay, but should forthwith order all
of the lawyers, all of the heirs; all of the
witnesses and all of the claimants into
court that the party committing the per
jury might be punished and the con

OUTSIDE JACOBSDAL. ORANGE
FREE STATE, Thursday. Feb. 15.-Ja
cobsdal is now In possession of the Brit
ish. .Yesterday a small cavalry patrol
entered the place and found it full of
wounded, including several British from
Rensberg. The place was occupied by
only a small force, which fell back before
the patrol after a series of small skir
mishes. A battery of artillery shelled the
environs and drove out the last of the
Boers.
Early this morning a large force of
Boers from Colesbergr, with ten guns, at
tacked a convoy of 200 wagons at the Riet
River, shelling vigorously and doing dam
age. But etrong reinforcements have
been sent hence and it is hoped they will
bring in the whole convoy in safety.
General French's division seized three
drifts on the Modder River. At the third
drift the Boers were fairly strongly en
trenched. General French bombarded
them and drove them off. j To-day he
moved rapidly in the direction of Kimber
ley.
The Boers have left Alexandersfontein,
which the British now occupy.
General Roberts is In excellent health
and spirits. The hardship and rapid
marching appear to agree with the whole
army, who are in splendid spirits under
the leadership of "Bobs."
The road between Modder 'River and
Jacobsdal is now open. The distance is
only nine miles. The road ' is available
for sending reinforcements and supplies.
When the Boers evacuated Jacobsdal. they
were obliged to pass over a ridge, where
they afforded a specially good mark for the
British guns, which showered shrapnel
upon the retreating enemy. The convoy
which was attacked at Riet River has
been countermanded, but the order did
not arrive In time and the experience was
a very warm one, although the Boers did
little material damage.
As General French, with his strength
ened division, pushed forward toward
Kimberley he found the beleaguered Boers
deserting their disposition at Alexanders
fontein, thus allowing: a portion of the
Kimberley garrison to occupy and en
trench the Place.

LONDON, Feb. 16.â "While the House of
Commons was on supplementary army es
timates to-day the Liberal leader, Sir
Henry Carapbell-Bannerman, after reaf
firming the intention of the Liberals to
do anything necessary' for a" successful
prosecution of the war, said the one thing
dominating the debate was the suspicion
that compulsory service was- projected. He
did not believe the Government intended
this, but. the intention of the Premier was
another matter." , Conscription by ..ballot,
he declared, was a . combination . of press
gang and roulette,, which was a very un
dignified way of increasing 1 the strength
which Great Britain mortgaged In her en
deavor to be before her neighbors in every
part of the world. She is now, he conclud
ed, reaping the fruits of this policy. '
The Government leader. Mr. Balfour, re
plied that no amount of effort could
make Lord Salisbury's speech appear to
favor conscription. Another speaker in
the House of Lords, he asserted, had re
ferred to compulsory service, but he was
a former colleague of Sir Henry Camp
b<=il-Hannerman. Mr. Balfour, continuing,
said he would gladly welcome some spe
cial suggestion, but had waited vainly for
Sir Henry to suggest a method of meeting
the heavy military responsibilities. The
speaker congratulated Sir Henry on es
caping the fault which had not been
avoided by some Important people in the
other house. Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man had shown no panic and had not,
in tones of trembling emotion, told them
the country was endangered unless it
mobilized the fleet. He had taken a saner
view of the position. Doubtless there was
one great and unexpected difficulty which
the Government would endeavor to re
trieve as rapidly as possible, but the po
sition did not justify tones of panic, least
of all from ihc noble lord who had and
deserved to have the right to lead pub
lic opinion. ?L::? L: : #Â¦*'
Finally the House passed the supple
mentary army estimatesâ Â£lJ,ooo,oooâ by
213 votes against 32.
The vote was carried under the closure
and amid violent protests from the Irish
benches against its application, while
several amendments remained unconsid
ered. W. Redmond exclaimed:
"This whole proceeding is most Irregu
lar.' It Is disgraceful.'
John Redmond, the Irish leader, in a
scene of continuing excitement, moved to
report progress, declaring that the first
Lord of the Treasury, Arthur J. BaJfour,
would facilitate the bill by resting con
tent with obtaining Â£13.000.000 by closure.
After a hot discussion this motion was
rejected by 231 votes against 40.

Fair that Simpton was an honest man,
and that money would not tempt him.
They told him in return that they knew
he could influence Simpton. that he would
have to do it and that the Justice could
name his own price for falling down on
the marriage story.
Sylva Played the Traitor.
"Sylva seemed very solicitous for Simp
ton's safety, especially after the Barling
affair, so we provided the Justice with
quiet quarters and hired a couple of
guards to protect him.
"Sylva came to us again Thursday aft
ernoon about 6 o'clock. He was very
much excited and told a story to the ef
fect that he had learned that the Fair
people had sent for the wife of Simpton-r
who had been separated from him for
some timeâ and were trying to get her to
cause serious trouble for her husband be
fore he could give his testimony in the
trial now in progress. This trouble was to
be of such a nature that it would destroy
the force of his evidence. He. said that
he would like to tell Simpton about it and
asked ua to disclose his whereabouts. -We
were thrown completely : oft our guard
by his frankness and we took Â¦ him
to Simpton'a room at â¢â¢ Geary and
Mason streets. When" we entered Sylva
led Simpton aside and i whispered a few
words to him. We supposed he was tell
ing him of his domestic troubles and did
not give the occurrence much thought.
Sylva remained but a few minutes and
went away. We followed in a short time,
leaving Simpton with his two guards.
Simpton Stolen From His Guard.
Â¦ "Subsequently we learned that Sylva
had been closeted In Fair's office during
the entire day before he came to us. We
had. left Slmpton but a few minutes when
Sylva returned and told the guard that
he and Slmpton would go to the Alham
bra Theater for the evening. The guard
wanted to accompany therru but Sylva
said that there would be no danger, as he
could protect Simpton from any of the
thugs that the Fair people could hire.
They finally agreed that the guard should
meet them at the entrance to the theater
at the close of the performance. It was
not until after they had left that the
guard became suspicious that something
was wrong, and notified us at once. We
searched the town from that time until
3 o'clock the .following morning, but could
not find Simpton, and believe now that
he has been liurrled out of the country.
We have- evidence, that within half an
hour after he left his rooms he was at
the home of Judge Hunt swearing to the
sensational affidavit which made. Its ap
pearance this morning.. When we left
Sylva- he made an appointment â¢to meet
us at our office at 9 o clock this morning.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.âConsidera

The bill providing a form of government
for the Territory of Hawaii was read, but
beyond thai formality nothing was done,
with it.
McEnery's speech was In support of
Bacon's resolution declaring the policy of
the United States toward tho Philippine
Islands. On the fields of Luzon, he said,
cotton and rice as tine as grown In any
part of this country could be produced.
Those products would be brought to this
country In competition with those grown
here. The growth of cotton in Luzon by
the cheap and degraded labor to be had
there would Interfere with the:establish

McEnery said the sums we "were ex

amendment to the constitution Is designed
to remove all doubtful construction of the
law and to effectually provide a means of
extirpating the evils of polygamy by mak
ing it unlawful in any place. It refers to
the Roberts controversy and says that
while the decision of the House estab

Feb. 16.â Secretary Hay has deter
mined to make an investigation for
the purpose of ascertaining what
truth there is in the assertion of
Charles E. Macrum that the British cen
tor at Durban opened his mail while he
was Consul at Pretoria. The British Gov
ernment, It is understood, has been
acquainted with the desire of Secretary
Hay to ioarn the facts and it is erpected
It will call upon the British censor at
Purban for an explanation. To furtlrsr
clinch the matter it may be deemed ex
pedient to call upon Mr. Kollis. who has
just been relieved at Pretoria by Consul
Hay, to report if he ever had an experi
ence of the kind reported by Mr. Macrum.
Upon receipt of this information the au
thorities will be In a position to reply to
any resolution of inquiry that may be
adopted by Congress based upon Mr.
Macrum's allegations. The authorities
liave completed their examination of all
Â«>f Mr. Macrum's reports and they declare
they have found sbÂ«olutely no mention of
liis mall having been opened by the een
eot. Had he reported such an occurrence
it is stated that Immediate action would
have been taken by the department,
'which would have prevented any repeti
tion. The authorities say that the official
mail of the I'nited States Consul should
not be tampered with by the military cen
por" and certaintly such action would re
mit in vigorous protests from the State
I Apartment. . .
So far as Mr. Macrum's innuendo re
epecting the alliance with Great Britain
is concerned, the authorities say they are
roady to refute it now if necessary. As
s-tated yesterday, the British Government
intimated to the I'nited States its willing
ness to enter into an alliance, but the au
thorities declined to listen to the intima
tion and there the matter stopped. Xo
formal propositions were made for the
reason that this Government's attitude in
dicated it could not consider them.

Staying at the Palace, where they went
after arriving in the city on the Coptic
from the Orient, are R. Nagelmachers,
assistant general manager, and O. Roditl,
chief engineer of the International Euro
pean Sleeping Car Company.
These two gentlemen are on their way
to Europe from Siberia, where they have
been for some time past attending to the
interests of their company on the line ot
the great Trans-Siberian Railway. They
go now to Paris, where they will take
charge of a panorama which will exhibit
the best of the scenery on the Siberian
ilne irom St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.
The panorama will be arranged so that
those enjoying It will imagine that they
are seated in a train going over the long
route through Asia. The scenes, which
are being arranged by two of the great
scenic artists or .France, will be made to
revolve around a stationary car In which
the spectators will be seated, thus giving
one the impression of being in a rapidly
moving train which is passing througn
the country observed from either side of
the coach. At dllferent points on the
route the train will apparently stop at
little villages, where refreshments will be
served by natives of those far-away parts
'of the world, who are now en route via
th<Â» Suez canal to join Mr. Nagelmachers
In Paris. ,
The whole scheme is one of great nov
elty and should prove a great success,
particularly as it will show much of the
topography of a country which for both
commercial and military reasons is at
present attracting a great deal of atten
tion throughout the entire world.
Speaking of the Siberian Railway Mr.
Nagelmachers said yesterday that it was
now possible to travel from Paris to
Vladivostok In twenty days, and when
the road Is completed this time will be
reduced to about a fortnight.
The present route is from Paris to St.
Petersburg, thence a distance of about
7000 miles to Irkutsk, where a trip of
forty miles is taken across Lake Baikai
by boat. Connecting with the rails on the
other side at a point named Mlssowia the
tourist makes another trip of 1000 miles to
Stretensk, which is at present the eastern
terminus of the road. Then comes a
seven days' trip down the river Amoor to
Haborovska. where tho rails are again
employed for a COO-mlle run, which brings
the traveler to Vladivostok and his Jour
ney's end.
The entire plan of thÂ» line when com

HANFORD, Feb. 18.â The Kings County
Farmers" Institute met in Hanford to-day
for a two days' session. Professors Fow
ler and Haynes of the State University
were present and delivered two addresses.
President Young of the Chamber of Com
merce delivered an address of welcome.
There was a large attendance at both thÂ«
morning and afternoon sessions and much
interest was aroused by the gentlemen
who addressed the assemblage. At noon
a free banquet was served.
Professor Fowler was the first speaker
at the morning session, and he took as
his subject the educational and social
value of farmers' organizations. The
speaker said that Kings County was ona
of the richest counties In the State, and
all she needed to keep her to the front
was for the farmers to organize and learn
how best to farm and market their prod
ucts. Professor Haynes' subject was
"Tilling Soil." He claimed that a farmer
had to exercise every day more common
sense than a man in any other business;
that a farmer rould not follow any pre
scribed rule, but good Judgment and long
practice Â¦were what he needed.
The Chamber of Commerce took hold
to make this Institute a success, and tho
Increased attendance over other Institutes
shows that Its efforts were well directed.

Chief Engineer McDonald Still Tes
tifying in :he Manauense Case.
The chief engineer of the Manauense
was again on the stand yesterday, most
of the time under cross-examination. His
evidence Tevealed a. peculiar state of af
fairs In the engine-room of the transport,
and one which has. not altogether been
accounted for.
He Raid the entries In the log were not
complete and the log had not been kept
up at all on the trip from San Francisco
to Honolulu because the engine-room
clock had stopped and because he was
busy elsewhere, anyway. lie said, too.
he had not recorded any entry of the
stoppages when they had to stoÂ« or slow
down to let the steam accumulate after
they left Honolulu.
The llrst assistant engineer had testi
fied that there had been no repairs made
to the donkey-pump while the vessel was
at Manila, but the prosecution produced
a blllfor $S5 for "repairs to the.donkey
pump," which had been signed by the
chief. He said he had signed the bill
under the idea that it was for $8 50. Coun
sel for the prosecution then demanded if
he did not owe the owners the difference,
and he admitted that he did. Hutton
then came to the rescue and the admis
sion was stricken from the record. Â¦ The
chief engineer said he had no clear Idea
of what the repairs to the donkey-pump
consisted.
The witness was asked If he thought
the vessel seaworthy when " she left this
port for Manila, and he said he did, in
every, respect. â¢ He said he had selected
his own men â¢ to man the flreroom and
engine-room and he considered the vessel
fairly well manned.

SUPREME COURT
OWNED BY DALY
So a Montana Witness
Declared.
WASHINGTON', Feb. 16.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections
did not resume Its consideration of the
case of Senator Clark of Montana until 2
o'clock to-day. The first witness was
Frederick J. Winston, a New York law
yer, who said he was present In the of
llce of Broker Kerr of New York some
time In November last, when Mark
Hewitt, a witness for the prosecution,
had expressed opinions reflecting upon
the State Supreme Court of Montana In
connection with the Wellcome disbarment
case before that court. Winston said
Hewitt had expressed the opinion that
Wellcome woula be disbarred, "as the Su
preme Court was owned by Mr. Daly."
Hewitt had said also that the general im
pression In Montana was that the Daly
people had supplied the 130,000 used In the
W'hiteside exposure to defeat Clark for
the Senate, but falling in that they were
then using tho money against Wellcome
in the Supremo Court.
In reply to a question from Senator
Chandler Mr. Foster, counsel for Clark,
said that Winston was put on to Impeach
Hewitt's testimony.
Walter Cooper of Bozeman, Mont., who
was one of Clark's supporters In his cam
paign for the Senate, was the next wit
ness, lie testified to having been present
at the meeting of Clark's friends In Butte
In July, 1898. preliminary to entering upon
the campaign. The purpose of the meet
ing was "to break the control of the Ana
conda Mining Company over the affairs
of tho State,' and he had done all he
could In the succeeding campaign to ac
complish the result. Of the seventy-nine
Democratic members of the Legislature,
the Clark people had believed after the
legislative election that fifty would vote
for Clark. He had failed. to get that num
ber owing to the Influence ofuhe Daly in
terest in the Legislature. In the entire
membership of ninety-four the witness be
lieved there were twenty-one or twenty
two who were employed by Daly, or who
were In enterprises in which that gentle
man was Interested, and he gave a Mat of
those so employed.
Cooper said he had been in Helena dur
ing the entire session of the Legislature,
but that he knew of no effort to corrupt
any member of the Legislature in Clark's
behalf. He had expended $200 during the
sitting of the Legislature, the money be
ing used in paying the expense of friends
of Clark who came to Helena to assist in
his campaign for the Senate.

Molineux and His Wife Listening to the Testimony.
NEW YORK. Feb: 16.-Roland B.
Â¦Molineux was to-day sentenced to
die In'Singr Sing prison during the
week of ilarch 26 for the murder
of Mrs. Katherine J. Adams. Mr.
Weeks moved for a new trial, on thÂ«
ground that the verdict was contrary to
the law and the evidence. He read ten
grounds for his application for . a new
trial, basing them chiefly on the legal ex
ceptions taken to the evidence and the
rulings of the Recorder. As soon as he
handed In his exceptions Weeks asked
that the defendant be permitted to speak
in his own behalf. To this Recorder Goff
at first demurred, saying that the request
was unusual, but finally, after some dis
cussion with 'Weeks, he ruled that Mol
lneux might be heard. Molineux straight
ened himself up and began:
I thank your Honor. Of the crime for which
I stand convlctÂ«Hl and of still another crime
with which I am charged I am absolutely and
entirely innocent. All of the evidence
The courtâ You are not charged with any
other crime. ,
The defendantâ l supposed that I might refer
to It. since the I>lstrlct Attorney did In his
<ij.4 ninK and closing argument.
The courtâ Your counsel has attended to all
of t-at matter.
The defendantâ Very well, your Honor. All
of the evidence produced here does not point
In the direction of guilt on my part. I refer
especially to the evidence of Miss Miller in
recard to the purchase of that silver bottle
holder. She did not sell it to me. Also to the
evidence of Mr. Koch respecting the letter-box
hired by somebody In the name of Harry Cor-
who is a man to respect the sanctity of the
grief of my afflicted wife and my sorely
afflicted daughter In affection and my daughter
in-law by her marriage to my sonâ Blanch*
Chesebrouith Molineux. In their behalf, my
friends, gallant comrades of the Grand Army
of tbÂ« Republic, gallant soldiers of the Con
federacy, late foes, but now friends, as well
as all others who resent Injustice and revere
womanhood, I ask you to assist me during my
struggle in the front lines of defense of those,
my best of earthly blessings.
As for mv sons, I trust that they are brave
men. with the strength to live and die bravely.
I have seen my son Roland asleep as a child
by his mother's side; I have seen him asleep
in his cell after the verdict condemning him to
death had been pronounced. Who Is better able
than I. his father, to Judge whether that sleep
was the natural sleep of Innocence? And I
have heard his first words of awakening at the
call of his father, as by reveille, from that
sleep after the verdict. "How is Blanche? How
Is mother?" and before that sad awakening
during all the dreary days of his confinement,
day by day. week by week, month by month,
there has been always that tlrst loving cry from
his lips for "Blanche and mother." Can he be
ruilty of cowardly poisoning? Is It possible?
Can It be? No: I know that he is innocent
as I know that lam alive. â¢ â¢ â¢ Hk e his
father, he has not been faultless, but he has
also had much of the better and kindlier na
ture of his mother. Is he a degenerate and a
vicious person? It Is Impossible and absurd.
Although no lawyer, I have always believed
the American bar Is the purest In the world,
and I still believe and honor and resoect the
bar as such. AVlth this belief it has been Im
possible for me to understand how a member
of that bar, and. In addition, a sworn public
prosecutor, a man educated In an American
college and associating with American men.
could assault by vile Insinuations a woman, the
wedded wife of the defendant.
Let me add one statement In conclusion. The
prosecution stated in public interview that I
was conscious of the guilt of my son. The
assertion Is made unequivocally and must be
answer*. l In like manner. It la absolutely false
and must have been known to him to be false
when he made it. I can conceive of no reason
which could have actuated such a falsehood,
except the consciousness that his own posi
tion needed aDOloev and defense.
My son. Roland Burnham Molineux. Is Inno
cent. I know it, and I ask no sympathy for
him. My only request Is that I may have the
heartfelt tupport of all those who believe in
noble American womanhood as exemplified in
those who bear the famllv name of

the Jury and that the court had but the
one duty to perform.
Directly after sentence had been pro
nounced Molineux was taken back on his
way to the Tombs. Almost before he had
left the courtroom Mr. Battle served no
tice of appeal upon District Attorney Gar
diner and upon the chief clerk.
SING SING. N. V., Feb. IS.â Roland
B. Molineux is now In a condemned cell in
the death house at Sing Sing prison, hav
ing arrived here this afternoon. There
was a curious crowd about the stalon.
Molineux appeared cool and did not seem
to notice the crowd. He was taken at
once to the death house, where he took
leave of his father, his brother and Law
yer Battle, who had accompanied him
from New York. He maintained his won
derful nerve and shook hands with each,
and in parting with his father said:

General Molineux bore up bravely, but

Molineux, convicted of the murder of
Mrs. Adams and to-day sentenced to
death, has issued a statement from hla
home in Brooklyn to the newspapers of
the country. In which he says:
It has been intimated in some of the news
papers that a fund should be raised for as
sisting the defense of my son. I. should not
allow pride to prevent me from accepting eucn
assistance If It were needed, for the reason
that I should not myself hesitate to offer U
to any person who nteded it and I should never
be ashamed to receive what I Bhould not be
ashamed to offer. But I owe no man a dol
lar and neither n<^A nor desire any assistance
of such a character. I feel, and am, amply
able In health, strength and In the courage
natural to a man, to sustain all the burdens
that Ood has placed upon me until He wills
otherwise. I am rich in the firm belief In
the Justice of Almighty Ood. In the devoted
love and comfort of a noble wife, my sons and
their wives, all united, all certain of the In
nocence of Roland Burnham Molineux and cer
tain that it will be so found in time. I need
for myself no other assistance and no other
comfort or support. But for my household I
do need and I do appeal for the support of the
prayers of all those of every denomination and
of every faith, who, like myself, feel that my
son Is Innocent and the victim of an unjust
persecution. I appeal, moreover, to every man

?
Declares That Men Who Never
Smelled Powder Are Now Scur
rying to Get an Income
From Uncle Sam.
"WASHINGTON. Feb. 15.â The House to
cay indulged in its annual joke by Etrlk'.ng
from the legislative appropriation bill all
rrovision for the Civil Service Commis
sion. This action is taken each year, in
committee of the whole, where the mem
ben do not go on record, and the pro
vision is then invariably restored when
the bill gets back to the House, where
members have to respond to their names
upon a roil calL The vote to-day upon
striking out was "75 to 67. To-morrow the
House will reverse this action, as usual,
on an aye and no vote.
Most of the time of the House to-day
beyond that occupied In the discussion
of the civil service law was devoted to at
tacks upon the speech made by Sims
(D.) of Tennessee on Wednesday, in
which he furnished some figures of the
Pension Office showing the number of ap
plications for pensions filed by soldiers of
the volunteer regiments engaged in the
Spanish war to show that the Northern
soldiers were much more clamorous in
that regard than the Southern ones, and
attributing this to the debauching of pub
lic sentiment In the North on the pension
question.
Pearre (R.) of Maryland raised the
storm by a reference to those figures and
the statement that hundreds of Massachu
setts soldiers who never smelled powdi-r
had applied for pensions. This brought
out an indignant reply from Fitzgerald
Â«D-> of Massachusetts, who detailed the
record of the Massachusetts volunteers
in the late war. He was followed by oth
ers who defended the records of the sol
diers from their several States. Hepburn
of lowa vigorously assailed Sims. Consid
erable temper was shown.
When the session opened the announce
ment of the receipt of the currency bill
from the Senate was made, and on mo
tion of Overstreet of Indiana, by unani
mous consent, the Senate amendmeiits
wer disagreed to. The Speaker appointed
Overstreet (R.) of Indiana, Erosius (II.) )f
Pennsylvania and- Cox (D.) of Tennessee
conferees.
The House then went Into committee of
the whole on the legislative appropriation
bill. Pearre (R.) of Maryland vigorously
attacked the appropriation for the Civil
Service Commission and charged that the
departments were full of Incompetents.
When the provision relating to the Civil
Service Commission was reached Pearre
said that if he though; the striking out
of the appropriation would put an end
to the civil service law he would make
the motion. He announced his unequivo
cal opposition to the Jaw. He reiterated
the charges made several days ago that
the departments were full of. incompe
tents.
"Where are they?" asked Fitzgerald
(D.) of Massachusetts.
"Where were they under the old sys
tem?" asked Pearre, replying with a ques
tion.
"Everywhere. There were thousands of
them." replied Fitzgerald. "If the bars
were down now you would have the de
partments crowded with Marylanders.
"Massachusetts need not sneer at
Maryland." retorted Pearre. "A few days
ago a gentleman read a list of hundreds
of Massachusetts soldiers who never
smelled powder during the Spanish war,
but who are already clamoring for pen
sions."
Fitzgerald Indignantly denied that tho
Massachusetts regiments had never
smelled powder In the Spanish War. The
Second Massachusetts, he said, had three
men killed and three officers and forty
one men wounded in the Santiago cam
f>algn. In all, the Second Massachusetts
ost &9 men. the Fifth Massachusetts 55
the Sixth 10S, the Eighth 197 and the
Ninth 130.
"What was the cause of their death?"
asked Wachter (R.) of Maryland.
'â¢â¢Disease contracted on account of the
inefficiency of the Government," replied
Fitzgeruld hotly, amid applause.
Fitzgerald, continuing, told a harrowing
story of the return home of the Massa
chusetts volunteers, broken and wrecked
by disease. If they had been rendered in
capable of earning a living by the fail
ure of the Government to provide for them
with proper care and sustenance then, he
said,. they were entitled to pensions.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa called attention
to the statement made by Sims on
Wednesday contrasting the records of
eight volunteer regiments in the North
and South, showing that from the former
came 2ZSS pension claims and from the
latter 761. Sims had attributed this dis
parity to the universal pension sentiment
in the North. Hepburn pointed out that
for the purpose of comparison the tables
adduced by Sims were not alike. He was
very caustic In his criticism of Sims' ac
tion. The latter said he had received the
tables from the Pension Office. He had
no personal knowledge of the facts. He
admitted some of the tables could not be
prepared, but contended that the main
point hÂ«? had made (the preponderance
of Northern over Southern pension
claims) was correct.
Green (D.) of Pennsylvania., who was a
captain in a volunteer regiment during
the Spanish I war. and who served at
Chlckamaupa, said that in the years to
come, in considering pensions for the sol
diers of the Spanish war, the sickness
due to maladministration of army af
fairs would have to be recognized.
CummlnÃs (D.) of Xew York paid a tri
bute to some of the dead New York
heroes. Sergeant Hamilton Fish and Will
iam Tiffany, and to the splendid valor
of Governor Roosevelt. The mention of
Governor Roosevelt's name brought out a
round of applause.
"The only objection I have to him."
sa'.d Cummings, "is that he is a Republi
can." (Laughter.)
Mahon <R.) of Pennsylvania said It was
unfortunate that the pension question
had been brought up to create ' partisan
ranror. During the past few years the
Democratic opposition to pensions had
disappeared. It should not be revived
now. Justice would be done to the Span
ish war soldiers without sectionalism
Galnes <D.) of Tennessee denied that
the Democrats were opposed to liberal
pensions; they were hostile only to the
unworthy claims.
Clayton (D.) of New York, who com
manded a troop of cavalry during the
Spanish war, resented the reflection upon
the conduct of the war. Our officers
rcpular and volunteer, compared favor
ably with thos=<j of any other country on
earth. We had made fewer mistakes
than the British are making and had
madp in South Africa.
Norton (D.) of Ohio declared that if the
Commissioner of Pensions prepared the
tables included in Sims' remarks .he
should be removed.
Taib*rt (D.) of South Carolina extolled
the courage of Sims.
"I am glad he has placed the facts be
fore os," said he. "He has opened the
eyes cf the House and the country "

THE detailed account of the ride of Oliver Lawson In the
Klondike is interesting and valuable. The distance he
traveled over from Dawson City to Skaguay is about 821
miles, and while It is not possible to ride a bicycle all the
way, Laweon holds the record for making the trip in the short
est time.
While making the trip Lawson did the Important and'lnter
esting work of measuring every foot of the journeyâ save that
over lakes La Barge and Bennett â with the cyclometer at
tached to his wheel, and now gives the exact distance between
the principal points along the route that will be traveled by
thousands this winter bound for Nome or Dawson and .those
from the Interior to the coast. He made the trip In fourteen
days, and believes from his experience that once the lakes
freeze and the trails become worn and packed the time be
tween Dawson and Skaguay can be reduced to from four to
five days, thus making the wheel a factor In the far northern
travel.
Lawson left' Dawson on November 28, on which day he
bought a copy of the Klondike Sun. published in Dawson' No
vember 28, thereby proving the date of his departure. Lawson
was accompanied a part of the way by C. E. Downie and C. D.
Sandford, whom he overtook on the trail, and they affirm that
Lawson and his bicycle hold the record, despite the rumor that
two others covered the distance in ten days. Although Law
son did not ride all the distance from Dawson to the coast, he
covered a great many miles on the silent steed, and many of
them were over the bosom of the great Yukon. He carried but
twenty-five pounds of baggage, and when mounted had that
strapped to the handle bars. A slight accident to a pedal was
all that the wheel suffered from the* long trip.
The flr^t day out from Dawson Lawson rode five and a half
hours. When not riding he pushed the wheel along, always
keeping the wheels touching, 80 the cyclomter would perform
its function. Klrkman was made the second day and Selwyn
the third. Crossing the Government cut-off from Hootchikoo,
Lawson walked the first twenty-four miles, which was hilly,
and then rode for forty-two miles. Traversing the railroad
grade between White Horse and Caribou, he rode half of the
way. The distances as measured by Lawson correspond closely
with those of the measurements made by surveyors, but as his
measurements are along the exact course interior travelers will
follow they are herein produced as taken from, the record kept
by Lawson:

TWO MEN KILLED BY
AN EXPLODING BOILER
Three Others Were Injured, One of

The explosion was caused by compressed
sir. which was to be used as the motive
power in the "midget" locomotive, a sn-aH
switch engine. Reardslcy was letting the
cir into the boiler when the explosion oc
curred. He had just turned on the pres
sure, and it is thought that not over 100
jM-iur.ds was in the boiler. The force of
the t-xplosion blew the front end of tue
toiler against the stone wall, tearing
away the window casing and wall and
leaking a hole twelve feet wide and about
twenty feet high. The boiler was blown
from the track and fell twenty feet away.
The dead men were horribly mangled,
their heads being blown from their bodies.

CURES QUICKLY.
A NÂ«-w Pile Cure Which Cures thj
Most Aggravated Cases Safely
and Quickly.
The Pyramid Pile Cure, a new prepara-
tion put up in suppository form, cures thu
most aggravated cases of piles in a tur-
prislnsly short time.
Mr. W. N. Dunn, Xo. 5713 Shields avenut,
Chicago. 111., writes: "I am Indebted a
thousand tlme3 to the Pyramid Pile Cure
for the speedy relief and permanent cure
of a most severe casa of piles. I was
troubled for months and yet was com-
pletely cured with one 60-cent box of thÂ«
Pyramid, and more tlmn that, I have still
three of the Pyramid suppositories left of
that one. box that I did not need to use.
X think It Is the grandest thing of th<s ago
and shall certainly recommend It to all
sufferers, and you are at perfect liberty to
refer any persons to me and I will gladly
answer any correspondence."
Thousands have resorted to expensive
and dangerous surgical operations for cure
of piles who could have been cured safely
and painlessly by the Pyramid; in a num-
ber of instances persons who had aperit
months In a hospital under treatment of
pile specialists without permanent relief
finally found the cure where they least
expected It. In the Pyramid Pile Cure,
which la applied at night, relieves the con-
gested parts, reduces the tumors gradu-
ally and naturally, removes the Intolerable
Itching and lecve9 no bad after effects, as
It contains no cocaine nor opiates.
It is a remedy no one need fear to apply
to the most aggravated case.

RATIFICATION OF
SAMOAN TREATY
Agreement Is Now in
Full Effect.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â The exchange
of ratifications of the Samoan treaty took
place to-day at the State Department,
und it is presumed that similar exchanges
occurred at the Foreign Offices In London
and Berlin. This is the last ceremony
necessary to give full effect to the Sa
mca.n agreement, though, as a matter of
form and public information here In the
United Stiuea at least. It may be neces
eary to proclaim the treaty.
Secretary Hay represented the United
States, Lord Pauncefote Great Britain
and Mr. Yon Holleben Germany. Owing
to the fact that there are three parties
to thJs treaty the method of effecting the
exchange differed considerably from the
usual order.
Mr. Hay retained for the United States
the copy of the treaty which was ratlfled
fcrjp the United States Senate. He handed
to L<ord Pauncefcte and to Mr. Yon Holle
beo copies of the treaty bearing the sig
natures of the President and himself. The
recipient of these copies made acknowl
edgments or receipts and the convention
was complete.
At London Mr. Choate and the German
1Z tn ba? ea.6 or were to receive copies of the
treaty from the hands of Lord Salisbury,
while in Eerlin Mr. White and the British
Etobiss&dor ofere to be handed exchange
reifies by Baron yon Billow.
The State JJepariment has taken steps
to notify Mr. OsUurn. the United States
Consul at Apia, of ttie consummation of
the agreement. It will make no differencc
in the status of Mr. Osbornâ ln fact, the
necessity for the presence of an American
Consul at Apia is now even greater than
before.
FRANK BELL
BEATEN BY
TIMEMAKER
Schorr Sprinter Showed His
True Form â Outsiders
Win at Tanforan,
Just for a moment it looked as if the
backers of Frank Bell, cne of three start
ers in the six furlong handicap at Tan-
foran yesterday, would cash their tickets.
It was a forlorn hope, though, for Tommy
Burns sat down hard on Timemaker, and
when Bell weakened the last thirty yards
the Schorr horse beat him out a head.
The winner was an even money choice,
and it was the only exciting finish of the
afternoon. Headwater, the other starter,
might have been closer up at the wire had
Yittlto* not grown Impatient and moved
too early.
Horses with all sorts of ripe, mellow odds
posted against them in the ring strolled
past the judges first. Ping, 8 to 1; Cho
teau, 10, Vioris, 16 to 5; May Gertrude, 1,
and Modwena, 5, turned up winners. None
were extensively backed, so the books had
a banner day.
There was a slump In the favorite mar
ket after the downfall of Lavator In the
mile and a sixteenth run, which opened
the sport. The chestnut horse was played
for a Rood thing at odds of 6 to 5, and
after showing blotches of speed ran un
placed. , Ping, a "now and then horse"
and 8 to 1 in the ring, won from start to
finish, beating Dogtown a length.
Although In past runs Choteau had
shown he could go seven furlongs Ihe
price against the colt floated back to .3 to
1 in the betting on the seven furlong run.
Bandera carried the heaviest backing at
odds of 9 to 5. with Racetto second, choice.
The favorite, Bandera, led to the stretch
turn, where Ross urged Choteau Into first
position, and hard ridden all the way
home downod Red Cherry a length. Sam
Dannenbaum was a good third.
Storm King, with vlttitoe up. failed to
repeat his victory of the day before in
the flve-furlong dash. His odds went from
twos to 14 to 5, and after much hard luck
Vlttitoe managed to land second to Vioris
at the wire. Henry iinished third on Es
pirando.
The fifth number saw Mortgage, a 3 to
5 chance, defeated in hollow fashion by
May Gertrude. The winner, well ridden
by T. Walsh, struck the wire first by a
couple of lengths with considerable to
spare. Silver Tail, out in front for a way,
managed to take the show.
Modwena, from the stable of Mat Storn,
led all the way in the closing five-furlong
sprint. St. Apollinaris, which was heavily
played, finished second, over a length In
advance of Gold Baron, the favorite.

CHOYNSKI
REVENGED
ON MAHER
Turns the Tables on the
Irish Champion, Defeat
ing Him on Points.
CHICAGO. Feb. 16.â Joe Choynskl was
given the decision over Peter Maher In a
six-round contest before the Fort Dear
bdrn Athletic Club to-night. The blonde
Californlan evidently had not forgotten
his former defeat at the hands of the
Irishman, for throughout the flght ho took
but few chances, contenting himself with
Jolting Peter with his left, a task which
he found comparatively easy. In the last
two rounds of the flght Maher, maddened
by tha sting of Choynskl's left glove,
rushed furiously, but was almost invari
ably straightened up, and during the clos
ing minute of the last round was so badly
punished that he was staggering as the
beil rang. , r
In the first round Choynskl caught Ma
her with a left hook squarely on tne poln'.
of the Jaw a second before the bell rang,
and it is probable that If the round had
lasted a moment more Choynski would
have won right there, as the blow made
MahÂ«r reel like a drunken man. Maher
made Joe go to the boards in the second
with hard lefts* to the chin and stomach
and had a clear lead during that round.
Thereafter, however, Joe had the better
of it. Jce left the ring with scarcely a
mark, while Peter's right eye was In bad
shape. Probably 50(w persons saw the
flght, which took place in the Second Reg
iment Armory.
Choynski was seconded by the three
Schrosbes â father and two sons. Maher
was seconded by his brother, Jim Maher,
arÂ«l Peter Lowry and Danny McMahon.
Malachl' Hogan was selected as referee.
Hound IâAfter1 â After a few seconds' fiddling Peter
landed a left solidly on the ribs, Joe counter
ing heavily on the cheek. Maher put right and
left to the jaw, Choynski planting his left 1b
Peter's rlbe and bringing it up to the eye. red
dening it. Choynski then planted a heavy left
on the face. Maher landing a l.'ft on the wind
a second later. Just as the bell rang Joe sent j
a terrlllc left hook to Maher*s Jaw, sending !
him staggering to his corner.
Round 2â MaJier apparently a bit groggy.
Choynski danced around him warily for *
minute, then led twice with the left, landing
lightly. Choynski planted a left on Mailer's

Training at Stanford
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. IS.â
The work of the Stanford baseball nine
has shown material improvement in many
points of the game during the last week.
Probably the most noticeable advance has
been In the stick work of the Individual
players. Coach Murphy feels that four
or five, of the men can be depended upon
to hit the ball when they come to the
bat. The others may hit it or they may
not. the likelihood being that they won't
If the point is badly needed. Howevor,
this fault can be overcome by hard work,
so it is felt that a few weeks hence the
players will be able to bunch their hits.
The work of the infield is still slow and
ragged. Two of its most experienced play
ers succeeded in making a total of six
errors between them in the last game with
the Fireman's Fund which goes to show
that the work of the season is not yet
far advanced. Lanagan is still improving
and ought â¢ soon to be able to put up a
good exhibition of twirling. His speed and
curve Is all that could be desired, but he
lacks , the judgment of an experienced
player. The outfield has been strength
ened by the presence of Chet Murphy, but
there is still a tendency to miss easy
chances, which can only be done away
with by a well founded confidence among
the players. . .. -'â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ -vÂ¦'â-Â¦v Â¦'â-Â¦
Coach Murphy expressed himself us
pleased with the work against 3anta
Clara yesterday. The ability to hit out
the ball at the right time brought home
the victory to the cardinal.
Work on the track still lags. Though
two professional trainers are always at
their command, the track athletes have
made little use of their services. More
men are needed in every event. Some new
talent in the pole vault and weights has
been discovered and is being rapidly de
veloped.
John Brunton, ex-track captain and at
one time the leading sprinter at Stanford,
is visiting the university for several
weeks and will coach the men in tho
sprints. It may be that his presence will
revive interest on the track.

THE YACHT CLUBS.
The Corinthians are Jubilant over being
able to enlarge- their clubhouse, build a
stage and otherwise Increase their accom
modations at Tlburon. The Jinks given in
this city on Thursday night was an over
â¢wrhelmlngr success.
The election of officers cf the San Fran
dsoo Yacht Club to serve during 1900
passed eff Wednesday night without a
tltch. H. R. Slmpkins, who had been
nominated as commodore, and R. S.
Brldgeman, â¢whose name had bÂ«en sug
gested for vice commodore, withdrew,
leaving I. Gutte for commodore, the only
opposition candidate. The former senior
officer of the San Franciscos was com
pletely snowed under, receiving only two
votes, one of which was cast by ex^Com
modore W. N. McCarthy, his rival for the
office. W. N. McCarthy was elected com
modore by thirty-six votes to two, and
the rest of the ticket was carried unani
mously, as follows : H. R. Simpklns, vice
commodore; James Kitterman, port cap
tain; E. C. Bartlett, recording secretary;
W. G. Morrow, financial secretary; R. B.
Hocue, treasurer; and J. R. Savory, meas
urer.
George D. Campbell introduced an
amendment to the constitution and by
laws that the women members of the club
rhould not be permitted to vote or to bo
oone directors. Ex-Vice Commodore G.
T. S. White spoke strongly In favor of the
amendment, which was vigorously op
posed by ex-Commodore T. â¢L. Hill and
Financial Secretary W. G. Morrow. The
laFt named urged that the Las Amigas
Club, which meets on the upper floor of
the yacht club house for lectures, music
ale* and basket ball, has beautified the
rooms and materially benefited the yachts
men and he stated his belief that none
of the ladles wish to vote or to be elected
on the board of directors. The advocates
of the amendment urge it as a matter
of principle, although th**y admit the ad
mission of women as members has been a
diftlnct advantage to the club, both pe
cuniarily and in a social way.
Keown, Carter and Wolf seem to be lead
ing for the positions. One noticeable feat
ure of California's game this year is the
heavy hitting. She has at least five sure,
safe hitters. The team will meet the Fire
man's Fund nine to-morrow afternoon in
San Francisco at Recreation Park. Eighth
and Harrison streets.
The freshman-sophomore field day will
be held March 3. No more than four men
from each class will be allowed to com
pete In each event. The following officials
have been chosen:
Colonel G. C. Edwards, referee: G.
Hufferdine, marshal; William Drum and
H. D. Smith, timers; C. Broughton. E.
Decoto and H. E. Squires, judges at finish;
C. K. Moser. clerk of course; Roy Simonds

TRAP SHOOTING
LURES GUNMEN
OFF THE FIELD
Elaborate Preparations for the
Opening of the Bluerock
Season.
Trap shooting is commencing already to
divert the attention of the gunmen from
field shooting and it will not be long be
fore a host of men. will be smashing clay
disks. The San Francisco Trap Shooting
Association, which has assumed the man
agement of the grounds at Ingleside, has
already made arrangements for a big sea
son's sport. W. E. Murdoch has been
made manager of the grounds. Three
dates have been arranged in March. The
members of the California Wing Club will
shoot live birds on March 4. The follow
ing Sunday the Olympic Gun Club men
will shoot live birds while the members
of the San Francisco Club will pepper
bluerocks. On the fourth Sunday the
Olympics will shoot bluerocks while the
San Francisco men will try their skill
on live birds.
The Olympians had a practice shoot at
live birds last week at which high scores
were made. W. J. Golcher killed 11-12
out of the two dozen birds at which he
shot, Clarence Nauman 11-9, C. A.
Haight 12-9, Herbert Kullman 11-10, and
Ed Fay 11. The directors of the Olympic
Gun Club have announced an entertain
ment in the clubhouse for members and
their friends on Saturday night, March
17. A number of clever entertainers have
volunteered their services and general hi
larity should prevail. At the last meet
ing of the club an associate membership
was established. This is limited to 100
members, who will be entitled to all the
privileges of the clubhouse, but not those
of the preserves. The initiation fee to
this was fixed at $2 50, with dues of ?1 a
month.
Achille Roos, who is prominently iden
tified with shooting interests, leaves next
Saturday for Mexico on pleasure bent.
The bay about Mount Eden is said to
be fairly carpeted with ducks for miles.
Some of these find their way inland, but
the majority are inaccessible to the
sportsmen.
Frank Maskey, one of the most thor
ough sportsmen on the coast, has pur
chased some property on Eel River,
where he proposes to make his home for
three months of the year. He will have
a comfortable house in the center of a
great fishing and shooting district, where
he can avail of all kinds of sport. Ellis
Robinson has been installed' as caretaker
and will secure boats and other requisites
of the sportsman.
L. R. Larzalere and J. H. Burfelnd
shot over their Alvarado preserves last
Sunday, securing a Joint bag of forty
five ducks. The day was warm and con
ditions were not favorable for good shoot
ing. - - â¢ "
Bert Patrick will put his fortunes to
the test to-morrow in the field near
Reeds Station, Marin County. The sprig
are said to be coming in in numbers and
he expects good sport with them.
Jack Sodter and Mallady were among
the fortunate ones in Richardsons Buy
last Sunday, securing twenty-five "cans.''
Dan Ross and Plummer killed fifty Eng
lish snipe and six ducks near Point Arena
some days since. ,
Mr Muller of the Southern Pacific Com
pany killed thirty-six ducks, including
sprig, bluebllls and "cans," last Sunday
near Mount Eden.

BASEBALL AND
PATH MEN OUT
ON THE CAMPUS
Bright Prospects for the Ath
letes of University of
California.
BERKELEY, Feb. 16.â The spring sea
son of athletics at the University of Cali
fornia has opened under the most favor
able conditions. The freshmen class of
fers a number of good track and baseball
men and the weather has been ideal for
preliminary training.
Track Captain William Drum has had
his squad of sixty athletes out each even-
Ing for light gymnasium work and short
cross-country runs. The principal object
is to strengthen the men's hearts and put
their wind into good condition. With slow
and careful preliminary exercise before
the hard training the results are much
better.
Xext Monday work on the track will
begin in earnest. Then the candidates for
the various events will be put through
their paces and coached. Gradually the
best men will be developed and put into
fcc-parate squads that the track captain
and trainer may watch them more close
ly. Captain Drum desires to develop dis
tance men specially for the mile and the
half-mile. Uhose are Berkeley's weakest
points and they will have to be strength
ened if success is to be attained on the
proposed Eastern trip. Squires and Gus
tafson of the old men and Faull of the
new men are the most promising. Pow
ell, who ran the mile last year, is train
ing for the hurdles. This event is also a
weak place and new men will have to be
developed.
In the sprints this year conditions are
entirely opposite from last year. Where
there were but one or two men last year
there are five or six this year who have
records. Drum, Cadogan, Symonds,
liroughton, Woolsey and Lippman ought
to make the dashes interesting. Each of
them can run in 10 2-5 seconds for the
classic "hundred."
Another two weeks should eive some
line on Berkeley's chances with Stanford
and the Eastern universities.
The present outlook in baseball is
brighter for California than it has been
in former years. Not for four years has
there been two baseball teams out for
practice each evening. The practices are
better attended by the students and there
is much more enthusiasm and interest
shown in the game. Two weeks aso
Coach Van Haltren took hold of the
squad with but four of last year's team
as a nucleus. He has shifted the men
around the diamond in order to get a line
on the best place for them until now he
has some semblance of an organization.
The infield is lining up as it probably will
against Stanford, with the possible ex
ception of third base, where there is a
strong fight between Braley, Jones and
Gardiner. Smith of football fame will un
doubtedly win the catcher's position;
Hamlhi, the initial bag; Fuller, second;
Hunttr. shortstop^ and Captain Kaars
burff, the box. Ivourse. a freshman. Is
showing j?ood form and may alternate
with Kaarsburg. In his* first game against
St. Mary's college, played on the campus
last Wednesday, he showed he was an
experienced pitcher and hard to hit.
Kaarsburff has experience in his favor
and can be counted upon never to go .to
pieces. The outfield is proving the hard
est to nIL Swan, shortstop last year, Mc-
shot near Santa Rosa last week. The
former bagged twenty-two snipe.
The score at the Olympic Gun Club
preserve last Sunday was: F. Feudner,
IS; Dr. A. T. Derby, 13, and 11. L. Mil
ler, S.
John Ringer, Tom Clark and a frirnd
fished and shot in the vicinity of Angel
Island last Sunday. The net result of
their outing was v bag of twenty "cans"
and bluebllls, and a large quantity of
rockcod.
FOR FREEDOM, the great English greyhound which won the nine stakes in which he has com
peted since his arrival here' in March, ISOS, is expected to make his appearance in competition
at Union Coursing Park next Saturday for the first time in a year. After winning the John
Grace challenge cup in February of last year he was retired from the field and much interest
Is centered in his performance next week when defending his title to the valuable trophy. For a
time it was thought he could not compete, owing to an unfortunate accident which happened him in
his kennel. In some unexplained manner he wrenched a nail from his right front foot. The
wound is healing properly and unless there is a set-back the great dog will be started/ He was
bred by the most noted coursing firm in England, the Fawcett Brothers, and was whelped in Jan
uary. ISC<6, making him four years old. He was landed in this city on March 16, IS9S, and on
March 19, three days later, was started and won. The betting opened at 10 to 1 against him and re
ceded to 75 to 1. In one round of the stake he met Move On and led him so far that Judge Bull
thought the latter unsighted and sent the brace of dogs back to slips. The next trial resulted the
same and the betters at once saw the dog's extreme speed and hammered the price down to 2 to
5. In a later round of the stake he defeated Rosette, then conceded to be the best greyhound on the
coast. He also, defeated Moondyne and Eclipse. In a few weeks it was seen he was the irreatest
greyhound in America and coursing men would not run their dogs against him except in specially
arranged champion stakes. In these good prizes were offered the (log beaten in the first round by
the ultimate winner of the stake. For Freedom showed his true speed but once. In a course with
False Flatterer, then at his best, For Freedom was unsighted and ran with head in the air some
thirty yards behind his opponent. Suddenly sighting the game he leaped out and scored the first
turn by two lengths. This has gone down in history as the fastest running ever done by a grey
hound on the local field. The pose of the dog in the picture is thoroughly characteristic of this
great greyhound. The bushy tail attracts the attention of the casual observer at once.

WITH THE SCULLERS.
The Ariel Rowing Club is beginning to
show signs of activity and has several
applications for membership on file. At
the last meeting of the club the following
six new members were initiated: Edward
J. Murphy of the Southern Pacific law
department, John H. Desmond and Aaron
11. Brown of the Southern Pacific freight
office, Walter 11. Young of the Sun In
surance Company and Charles J. Mc-
Keon. The new officers for the first half
of 1900 were installed after the meeting.
The increase in the number of members
having rendered it necessary for the club
to own more boats, the directors were
authorized to negotiate for the purchase
of the Louise. New sets of oars and new
sliding seats have been ordered from the
East and the barges and skiffs are being
put into first-class order.
Kington of the University of California
is getting together a four-oared crew, so
that it is to be hoped the university will
be represented in some of the races dur
ing the coming season. Smith and Allen
are' also practicing in outrigged. skiffs.
An intercollegiate rowing contest seems
still a long way off. as until the Palo
Alto men have good water upon which
to practice there is not much likelihood
of the Berkeley men taking to rowing
with any great enthusiasm.
John Hammersmith, leader of the
Olympic Club, is as enthusiastic as ever
about the project of establishing a run
ning track, athletic field and boating
quarters for the Olympians on the Ala
meda side. He has not waited for the ac
complishment of his plans before begin
ning to row for himself, for he has al
ready joined the Alameda Boat Club and
goes out in the outrigged skiff under the
coaching of S. J. Pembroke. Though Mr.
Pembroke has reached an age at which
most men give up racing, he has an
nounced himself as ready to pull five
miles in an outrigged skiff against all
comers.

DRAG HUNTERS
PREPARE FOR
A BUSY WEEK
San Mateo County Hunt Will
Enjoy Three Runs After
the Hounds.
The members of San Mateo County
Hunt met last Saturday at Belmont sta
tion and enjoyed a fine run, the course
being so laid that it could be followed al
most all the way by those who drove
along the road. Many friends of the
horsemen drove to i Belmont to see the
throw-off and to witness the finish at the
Brittans house, near San Carlos. In the
evening the master of the hunt was enter
tained at dinner by the members at the
Burlingame Country Club house. The
health of Francis J. Carolan was proposed
by J. J. Moore and responded to by Mr.
Parrott, who said that the master had
done rruch to encourage the sport of drag
hunting, and that he hoped to see more
pink coats in the field in future. W. S.
Hobart toasted Duncan Hayne, the treas
urer of the Hunt Club, and the latter
made a neat response. F. J. Carolan then
arose and proposed the health of W. S.
Hobart. who, he said, founded the sport
on the Pacific Coast by importing the first
pack of drag hounds. The health of "the
man who broke most fences" was drunk,
with much laughter.
This honor belongs to E. D. Beylard.

SNEAK TACTICS.
rROM the course which has been taken by Phe
lan and Lawrence, as disclosed partly by certain
proceedings of the Police Commission, but
mainly by the indiscreet rage of the Examiner, it ap
pears the gang have concocted a scheme to obtain
control of the Police Department by sneak tactics.
Esola, who was permitted to withdraw a candidacy
which should have been rejected on the ground of
his personal unfitness, is to be promoted and put in
line for the position of Chief as soon as a vacancy
occurs; and the gang may make a vacancy sooner
than the public expects.
It is evident from all these things that the public
must be on guard. Biggy was retired from the Police
Commission mainly for gratification of malice, but
in the malice there was cunning. The reorganized
commission has made a showing of honest intention,
and the public will be slow to impute dishonor to
them. Nevertheless, the outlook is ominous. The
manner in which Biggy is being hounded even after
he is out of office looks like an effort on the part of
Lawrence to show the Commissioners what is in store
for them if they stand as Biggy did for honesty
against the schemes of gamblers and blackmailers.
The "new phase of the situation is one that no pub
lic spirited citizen can afford to overlook. The indig
nation that forced the gang to drop the scheme for
a while must not be permitted to pass away and give
place to indifference. The danger is not over. Phe
lan is still in office, Lawrence is still in charge of
the Examiner, the gamblers and blackmailers are still
in the city, the pliant Esola is still available for dirty
work in high officfe. It is no time for the people to
permit their attention to be distracted from the issue.
The sneaks are but waiting for the storm to blow
over. As soon as they think it safe to do so, the en
croachments will begin, and little by little they will be
pushed forward, until we have in San Francisco that
wide-open town the rascals desire. They can afford
to wait, for the profits they will make by tribute
levied on the tenderloin and Chinatown, by exactions
from saloon-keepers, and the gains they will take in
over their own gambling- rooms, will be a' rich spoil
when Esola is Chief and Lawrence and Mose Gunst
run the town.
A movement to license poolrooms is receiving some
encouragement from the authorities. The earnest

TO EXTEND POUND LIMITS.
Supervisors' Hospital Committee Will
Recommend It. '
The Supervisors' Hospital Committee
yesterday unanimously decided to recom
mend the passage of an ordinance extend
ing the pound limits. This course is the
result of a petition of numerous residents
in the district affected wherein it was re
quested that the limits be extended to
the following line: Commencing 1 at Mis
sion and Canal streets, along Tlngley
street to Alemany avenue, to Croke street,
to Mission, to Russia avenue, to Edinburgh
street, to China avenue, to Lisbon street,
to Silver avenue, to Craut and Canal
streets, the point of beginning.
The committee also decided to insert a
clause in all proposals inviting 1 bids for
milk for public institutions that the milk
be the product of cows that have been
subjected to the tuberculin test.
PRESS COMMENTS
CONTRAST THESE STORIES.
Fresno Republican.
Edward H. Hamilton of the Examiner Is
a good reporterâ too good to work for the
Examiner. When he is left to himself he
tells the truth lilfe a man, and when he is
instructed to invent a lying roorback he
omits his signature, that the responsibility
may rest where it belongs. Contrast the
ridiculous tale of bribery sent up from
Sacramento with the generously apprecia
tive article on Senator Bard in yesterday's
Examiner. The one was the Examiner's
instructions, and lied: the other was Ham
ilton's report, and told the truth.
All the same, the Examiner Is a skulking
coward, as nothing better shows than this
incident. Probably it does not yet know
what hurt it, but when it ran up against
the solidest fact In the world â a strong
man's character â it discovered that some
thing was amiss, and retired with more
haste than dignity. For once it has not
had the courage to carry an indecent be
ginning to the filthy end, and for this
small boon of cowardice let us be duly
thankful.

THE OFFENSE OF PERJURY.
OUT of the Fair case there has come one of
those instances of perjury which constitute
about the blackest and most dangerous blot
there is upon our administration of law. This offense
is sensational and startling, because it occurs in a suit
involving millions of money and affecting a family
which has now attained to the highest social emi
nence. Similar offenses, however, have been, unfortu
nately, too frequent. The public hears of them first
from this side and then from that. At times they arc
committed under circumstances which raise a strong
suspicion that members of the bar have connived at
tHem if not actually prepared them.
In this case the perjury is extraordinary. Simpton,
who once was sufficiently esteemed by his fellow citi
zens to be elected Justice of the Peace, made an affi
davit and swore he had married James G. Fair to Mrs.
Nettie R. Craven. It was expected he would testify to
that effect in court. Instead of doing so he makes a
counter affidavit alleging that he had been offered
$i 0,060 to testify that he had performed the marriage,
and that he had given a pretended consent for the
purpose of entrapping the conspirators and exposing
their guilt.
That a gross crime has been committed against the
law is apparent. It behooves the courts to inquire
into the offense and explore it to the bottom of its
black depths. Our courts must be kept clean of per
jury, or otherwise high-handed fraud will seat itself
in the temples that should be sacred to inviolate jus
tice. The evil is growing, and this case, by reason of
the wide fame it will have, is a most excellent one in
which to demonstrate the power of the law to clear
the courts of such offenders.

COST OF HIS BLUNDER.
Tulare Register.
Mayor Phelan has not come out of the
Esola and Police Commission business
with credit. It Is the first severe blow
that he has received since he took office,
but it is a stinger and the sting thereof
will hurt for a long time to come. The
turning over of the appointment of the
Police Commissioners to Andy Lawrence
of the Examiner was a profound blunder
and evidently the result of a pre-election
bargain that ought not to have been
made. The farming out of appointments
to office is about the last depth of polit
ical depravity and shows that Mayor Phe
lan has not that lofty character and high
sense of honor that his admirers In all
parties fondly hoped he possessed. He Is
smirched and the smut will stick to him
during his official career, which career Is
likely to be greatly shortened by the Inci
dent.
The Board of Supervisors have reached the conclu
sion that the tracks of the Southern Pacific Company
which have constituted death's road through the Mis
sion are a nuisance. This appears to be a new name
for an agency that has brought death and suffering
as the price of its existence.
AMEND THE CHARTER.
SIXCE the exposure of the trick by which the
telephone corporation succeeded in having the
new charter so framed as to leave that or any
other telephone corporations exempt from municipal
supervision and regulation, it has become evident to
r.JI public spirited citizens that the charter must be
amended. It is unfair that corporations controlling
one kind of public utility should be possessed of privi
leges not granted to others, nor is it consistent with
a just public policy that any such corporation should
be outside of municipal supervision, and superior to
its direction.
The amendment in this case is the more urgent be
cause the defect in the charter was brought about by
trickery and intrigue. A large majority of the framers
of the charter were unaware of the exemption given
to telephone corporations when they approved the
charter, and the citizens knew nothing about it when
they ratified the instrument. We have thus not only
a defect to be remedied, but a wrong to redress, and a
double motive therefore prompts to immediate action.
Section 8 of article XI of the constitution of Cali
fornia, after defining the processes by which cities, and
counties and cities, may be provided with charters,
says: "The charter so ratified may be amended at
intervals of not less lhan two years, by proposals
therefor submitted by the legislative authority of the
city to the qualified electors thereof, at a general or
special election, held at least forty days after the pub
lication of such proposals for twenty days in a daily
newspaper of general circulation in such city, and
ratified by at least three-fifths of the qualified electors
xoting thereat, and approved by the Legislature as
herein provided for the approval of the charter. In
submitting any such charter, or amendment thereto
any alternative proposition may be presented for the
choice of the voters and may be voted upon separ
ately without prejudice to others."
By that provision of the constitution a clear way
is open for immediate action toward the desired
amendment to our new organic law. The Supervis
ors, being the legislative body of the city, should at
once frame a resolution in the nature of an amend
ment to the charter, conferring upon the city govern
ment the right to regulate telephone companies and
corporations, and direct the Election Commission to
call for a special election upon the issue without de
lay. The amendment should be adopted by the peo
ple this year so that it may be ratified by the Legis
lature when that body meets next January. Moreover,
the election should be called early, for two reasons â
first, that the subject may be taken up while it is
ftesh in the minds of the people; and, second, so that
the issue may be disposed of before the coming of the
excitemer.ts of the Presidential campaign.
The matter is in the hands of the Supervisors. They
alone have the right of initiative under the constitu
tion. They cannot be ignorant of the temper of pub
lic sentiment upon the subject. It is therefore not
too much to expect that they will give it prompt con
sideration and take the steps required to bring about
the amendment.

PARTY MANAGEMENT.
SINCE the happy and successful conclusion of
the long contest for the election of a Senator
much has been well and pointedly said about
the reorganization of the Republican party of Cali
fornia. In one sense the party needs no reorganiza
tion. As an organic political body it acts through
certain agents called commiueemen. Sometimes these
forget that they are agents or trustees, and proceed
to act for themselves, for their own personal advan
tage, without regard for the welfare of their principal
and trustor, the party. Some of these agents have
perhaps had this merely personal idea of their posi
tion and its powers and functions since the great vic
tory of 1898. The election of Senator Bard, in ac
cordance with a policy that came up from the great
body of the party, is notice to such that attention has
been drawn to the error of their ways.
As we view it a party committeeman and an officer
elected by a party simply hoW a party and a public
trust, and have no more right to use it for personal
profit than has a fiduciary trustee to convert to his
own use funds held under his trust.
Therefore we take it that when reorganization of the
Republican party is mentioned and urged it means
that the trustees of the party will be selected freely
and without duress, promise, bargain or barter of any
kind, with anybody, and that they will simply act as
the party agents and assume none of the authority of
a principal.
An officer elected by the party, with the appointing
power, should use it without invidious discrimination.
He has no right to dispense it in payment for votes
cast in the Legislature for Senatorial candidates, or
for any other specific personal purpose. As he has
no right to dispense it as a reward, he has none to
withhold it as a punishment. His obligation runs to
the whole party which elected him. In the party are
perhaps large numbers, enough to have turned the
result at the polls, who were called on to quench their
likes and forget their dislikes in party loyalty. Had
they not done so he would not have won in the ballots.
Therefore such officer must treat all men in his party
just as his party had to treat him in order to elect
him. When he does this there are no divisions, no
feuds nor factions, and the man who is capable of it
advances any further ambitions he may have much
more by this proper use of his power than he can by
its misuse in building up a personal following by a
system of rewards and punishments.
We assume, then, that the Republican party intends
to enforce these proper principles in the future. In
doing so it does not propose to impeach or punish
anybody nor to indict and stand as accuser of any.
It will accomplish its purpose by the selection of
agents known by their record to be fitted for that
sort of trusteeship. That, stated in its simplest terms,
is what is meant by party reorganization. When the
next convention meets it will be to deliberate, not to
ratify without examination a programme pre
pared by its agents. It will tolerate discus
sion of every purpose and proposition. Through
intolerance of discussion and weak surrender to as
surance and noise it was placed in the painfully false
position on the money question in 1896. Instead of
standing for a principle, seasoned and proved by dis
cussion, it was rushed into the indorsement of a pro
gramme which was upset in the National Convention
and nearly led to disaster in the election.
In fine, the party will have leaders, but not bosses.
The leader discusses principles and persuades to their
adoption. The boss gives orders. The leader is an
educator and administers neither punishment nor re
ward. The boss rules solely by using patronage to
compel obedience. The leader is a teacher. The
boss is a tyrant. When a party succeeds under a
leader he is watchful of it that it enforces the prin
ciples taught. When it wins under a boss he treats
his patronage as private property, to dispense as he
pleases, regardless of the party honor or the public
good.
We believe that the party wants leaders and not
bosses. It wants wise leaders, who, viewing the whole
economic field whereon party policy reflected in gov
ernment affects the welfare of the people, are equipped
by knowledge for counsel. It does not want pseudo
leaders, who see visions and dream dreams. Nor does
it want that class of pretenders who, lacking in posi
tive knowledge, experiment with policies and govern
ment by the rule of thumb. It wants cool-headed, far
sighted and thoroughly informed leaders, and when
its want is made known they will not be lacking.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1900.
A QUESTION OF VERACITY.
BY an editorial in the Examiner of yesterday the
public is apprised that the gang which sought
to obtain control of the Police Department by
the election of Esola as Chief is vindictively bitter in
defeat, and is seeking not only to gratify its malice
but to obtain by sneak tactics the office and the power
that were snatched from it.
As William J. Biggy i s the man who baffled the
scheme of the conspirators and saved the city from
their looting, it is against him their malice is mainly
turned. He was yesterday denounced by the Ex
aminer as a liar. Such a denunciation from such a
source will raise rather than lower Mr. Biggy in pub
lic esteem. Still the form of the malicious attack
raises certain questions which the people would like
to have answered.
Mr. Biggy has stated that he received his appoint
ment as Police Commissioner primarily from Law
rence, and that Phelan as Mayor did no more than
ratify it. Will the Examiner state whether that is or
Mr. Biggy has said that Lawrence told him that
Phelan promised Lawrence the four Police Commis
sionerships, and that it was upon the basis of that
promise Lawrence offered one of the commissioner
ships to Biggy. Will the Examiner state whether or
not that is true?
Mr. Biggy has asserted it was Lawrence and not
Phelan who selected all four of the Police Commis
sioners, that Phelan totally abdicated his functions
in that "respect in favor of Lawrence. Will the Ex
aminer tell if that be true?
.Mr. Biggy has declared Lawrence told him the
Mayor had given Lawrence the four positions to be
filled with Lawrence's own friends, and that Law
rence said his principal object was to have Esola
chosen Chief of Police, and that Phelan knew it and
was agreeable to the selection. Will the Examiner
affirm or deny that statement?
Mr. Biggy has said that at the time he was offered
the commissionership by Lawrence he was asked by
Lawrence to vote for Esola as Chief of Police. Will
the Examiner answer if that statement be true or
false?
The Examiner has charged in general terms that
Biggy is a liar. Now let it come forward and say
in what he has lied. The questions which The Call
has stated are some of those which occupy the public
mind. Will the Examiner for once have the courage
to meet an issue frankly? Will it put aside equivo
cation, evasion, shifting, shirking and all kinds of
sneaking, and answer the questions?
When the questions have been answered, if the Ex
aminer dare answer them, The Call Will/ have some
thing more to say on the subject. If the words and
statements of Mr. Biggy need confirmation The Call
will furnish it.
Out of all the revelations that have come of this
miserable scandal nothing appears that stains the
honor of Mr. Biggy. On the contrary, his reputation
as an honest man and a fearless, upright official has
been increased by each new disclosure. He now holds
in the community a position of which his friends may
be justly proud. He has shown himself to be the
natural enemy of scoundrels â one whom they can
neither delude, entice nor terrify. He can well afford
to ignore such malice as the baffled gang of gamblers
and blackmailers are now showing; but, for all that,
the public would like to hear from Lawrence on the
specific charges that have been made. Will Lawrence
answer, over his signature, or will he, behind the foul
curtain of Hearst's paper, continue to shirk, evade,
malign, slander and lie?

sible "to ride on Illinois Central rails from
either Chicago or Omaha to New Orleans
and most of the other prominent railroad
points in the South. \
While on his way out to this city Mr.
Harahan established agencies at Salt

Health. Board Adopts System of Al
ternation Among Employes.
The#Board of Health last night adopted
resolutions whereby a saving of $2350 per
month will be effected by a system of
alternation among the employes, which
will go into effect Immediately and con
tinue until March 1. when the second de
tail of alternation will be made. The
summary of reductions is as follows:
Five sanitary inspectors. $300; five food in
epectors, $275; three market inspectors, $225; one
bakery inspector. $75; one superintendent City
Cemetery *" 5 '. clx emergency surgeons, $WK>; one
matron Central Emergency Hospital, $60; one
steward. Central Emergency Hospital, JbO; one
matron Harbor Emergency Hospital, $60; one
matron Intention Hospital for Insane, J6O; one
steward. Detention Hospital for Insane, $60;
two plumbing inspectors. $200. Total. $2350.
The resolutions recite "that the board
was not indifferent to the embarrassing
position in which the Board of Supervi
sors had been plunged In the effort to
raise funds for the city's needs; that the
board Is willing to temporarily suspend
certain Important functions vested in It
by the charter, believing that should
emergency arise with which the depart
ment might be unable to cope the Super
visors would be willing to share the re
sponsibility and that an Impartial public
will appreciate the circumstances and re
serve Its criticism." The heads of de
partments were directed to have the em
ployes draw by lot for alternate employ
ment. . .
A comparative financial statement was
submitted showing that the payroll at the
City and County Hospital for the month
of December, 1899, was $2949 75. and for this
month it will be J2SB9 95, orÂ«$S9SO less. In
its reorganization of the department the
board claims to have effected a decrease
in salaries of $322 per month.
Dr. Max Solomon's resignation as assist
ant sanitary inspector was accepted and
Dr. William C. Hassler was appointed to
the vacancy. The position of Superintend
ent of the City Cemetery was abolished
and the Dlslnterment Inspector was
placed In charge of that reservation.
Chief of Police Sullivan was present at
the meeting, and informed the board that
as all police officers are health inspectors
under the charter he would devise for
them a proper tour of duty in order to
supplement the work of the board. Dr.
Williamson thanked the, Chief for his co
operation in behalf of the health Interests
of the city.

club, entertained a vast audience for over
an hour with a pleasing recital of the
points and places of interest inÂ» Washing

ehown through a stere^pticon. During the
evening the audience was also entertained
by the various select numbers on the pro

environment, the Impressiblenesa of a su
perstitious age? Since Joan was simple
hearted, honesty incarnated, did the fair
ies and the saints converse with and
prompt her daring spirit? Did they teach
her the military technic which put to
shame the trained generalship of her op
ponents? If so, why did they desert her in
her hour of need? These questions have
never beenâ can never be â satisfactorily
answered. A long list of literati. Tascinat
ed by the achievements of this simple
wondermaid, Schiller, Voltaire, Southey,
De Larr.artine. Michelet, down to Mark
Twain offer ingenious solutions of the
problem of. Joan the selfless; but the curi
ous world still asks.
Jeanne d'Arc was an excitable, hjper
imaginative child who took to heart with
more than the usual llteralness of that |
superstitious age the tales of the fairies
that danced nightly around the Tree of
the Ladies," "L'Arbre Fee de I>ourle
mont." celebrated in the folksongs of
France. The mists, the rainbows, the
dusk and the dawn were as really falry
peoplecl to this child of the fifteenth cen
tury as they are germ-burdened to her
twentieth century sister. Mingled with
these visions of a morbid imagination
were burning thoughts of her country s
wrongs, of the sufferings of her soldier
countrymen, and as she plied her distaff
she made herself, childlike, the victorious
avenger, the peace-bringer to France
Wherl 15 years old these self-centered
dreams were rudely broken oft and then
intensified by a marauding band or
Sd"ers. who burned the village chapel
and forced the inhabitants of Domremy
to rtpÂ«Â» for their lives. After that the fai
rie, toikVn the forms of St. Michael, the
archangel of battles, accompanied by St.
Catherine and St Marguerite.
When this brooding child ventured to
confide her visions to her parents Both
chlded her for her unwomanliness. and
forbade the continuance of the lance
tilting and military riding and maneu
vering with which the embryo general
was startling the village gossips Always
obedient, modest and pure-minded, the
child nevertheless found it quite im
possible to rid ncr mind of the bewllder-

clad in the coarse red dress and close
white cap worn by the peasants pf Dom
remy. she left forever the lowly home
which had fostered the vision that was to
destroy her. When the sturdy captain
heard of her approach he exclaimed.
"Give her a good whipping and take her
back to her father!" But when the girl,
after her four-league tramp down tne
Meuse Valley, forced her way into his
presence, declaring herself called of God
to raise the siege of Orleans and bring
Charles to Rhelms to be crowned, the
burly captain was cowed by her earnest
ness believed her possessed of a witch
and sent for the Archbishop to protect
him. The wonder is not that one Joan of
Arc rose from this superstition-ridden
ace spirit-prompted to fulfill the prophecy
that a maid from the Marches of Lor
raine was to save the realm, but that
thousands of maidens steeped in like su
perntfturalism should not have thronged
to the Dauphin's standard.
When Baudrlcourt became convinced
that Joan was heaven-sent, he dispatched
her suitably equipped, to the Dauphin's
court, notwithstanding the, frantic appeals
of Joan's parents, appalled at the prospect
of their gentle, pure-minded daughter in
the grim clutch of the war derll. Arrived
at the dallying French court, Joan was led
by her "voices" to distinguish the dis
guised monarch from his courtiers, and to
reveal to him one of his secret transac
tions, which caused his face to blanch and
his spirit to quail. Thereby convinced
that the poor little shepherdess thorough
ly understood herself. Charles forthwith
equipped her In white armor, engraved
with the triple fleur-de-lis, and a white
banner embroidered with the same em
blem and painted with a picture of the
Savior. Then she set forth to take charge
of the enthusiastic, impatient army of
France, rapidly rallying to her mysterious
standard.
When this fierce soldiery, made up of
i fire-eaters, cavaliers, brigands and fanatic
peasantry, beheld their 17-year-old ccm
mander-in-chief unfurl the mystic ensigi
that was to lead them to victory they folt
themselves purified and emboldened by
her modest simplicity. So great was the
sway of her gentle personality over this
fearful host that the success of the 3iege
of Orleans was assured before the army
set its face toward that besieged city.
In less than four months after Joan
Btarted on her mission the military mita
cles of the speedy evacuation of Orleans
by the terrified English, of the signal vic
tory of Patay and the capitulation of well
garrisoned Troyes opened the way for the
triumphal entry Into Rheims, where the
Dauphin was anointed with the holy oil
of Clovis and became Charles VII of
France.
Overcome at the speed of the consum
mation of the dream which had haunted
her night and day, Joan now begged pite-
torles and relying too much upon the mys
terious thrall of the maiden, grew care
less of military precautions and provis
ioning, and rashly forced her into perilous
situations. Her usual military Intelli
gence and shrewd sense urged caution In
vain. Wounded, disheartened, Joan might
still have taken Compiegne in face of im
possibilities had she not, while in the rear
of the army covering the retreat of a
sally, been betrayed by the governor of
the city, who shut down the gates, leav
ing her upon the bridge outside.
As a military general she was entitled
to ransom, but while Indignant France
waited to hear of her redemption It was
stupefied to learn that Burgundy, her
captor, had sold her to his English allies
for 16,000 francs. Betrayed by a French
governor, sold by a French noble to a
French priest, the French populace simply
grieved that its supine French King never
lifted a finger to rescue his rescuer.
From the revolting spectacle of the trial
following Joan of Arc's capture the sensi
tive biographer turns with aversion. For
one long year she was tortured spirit
ually, mentally, bodily at the English
headquarters. Her "voices" became fore
bodings, and because they did not miracu
lously release her from imprisonment she
was tried and condemned for sorcery. In
that benighted age such condemnation
was but the logical outcome of her pre
ternatural elevation. Those who on the
coronation day had hailed this maiden aa
"the Savior of Franco/ "the Chieftain
Invincible." "Victory's Sweetheart." "the
Genius of Patriotism." "the Page of
Christ." could now find no better titles
for her than "Vile Witch," "Heretic
Abandoned."
Removed from one loathsome prison to
another. Joan was tormented and assailed
with cunning questions; she answered
these subtleties with such Intelligence
that her replies nearly worked the undo
ing of her accusers, so that they hastened
to spread nets for her destruction. Since
a year's mental trial had left the un
taught girl master of the field, they tried
bodily terrorism. They accordingly con
ducted her in chains to a stake with fa
gots ready for llghtlngand called upon her
to adjure the divinity of her mission, or
to repent. Worn in body and soul, con
fused by the heat, she let fall some dis
couraged words that were construed aa
a recantation. But they did not wish her
to escape burning by recanting. So after
they had taken her back to prison they
extorted from her a promise that she
would not wear the masculine attire
which she considered her only protection
in her unseemly, men-guarded imprison
ment. Now the longed-for consummation
was easy to reach. Relying upon Joan.-?
modesty, her persecutors stealthily re
moved all feminine apparel, leaving her
to choose between nakedness and the pro
scribed attire. Realizing the futility of
longer resisting such treachery, she put
on the raiment and paid the penalty at
the stake. The most spiritual, saintly
flower of the most brutalized century in
the history of France was dragged to her
execution in a felon's cart, wearing for
her halo a miter-shaped cap bearing the
legend. "Heretic. Relapsed. Apostate.
Idolator!" ' _'' "" . . . ?
To me the tragedy of Joan or Are 3 nl3
tory was not her flery death, nor the
weakness of a once devoted populace,
nor the ingratitude of a King whom in
her loyalty she defended even on the scaf
fold as "the most Christian King that
ever lived"; it was the failure of the
"voices" to bring the release she had,
earned. If we could but throw our minds
six centuries back and so comprehend the
vivid reality which these mysterious
shapes assumed in Joan's lonely comrnun
lngs and what potent mastersprings they
became in her success we could reallzs
In part how dark was the tragedy of their
inexplicable desertion in her pitiable dis
tress. And yetâ and this proves that her
religion was not a batch of overtmagin
atlve sentimentalities, but the material
from which heroes are carved â in the face
of thl3 crushing abandonment her faith
rose supreme and reasserting her creed,
with her eyes on the crucifix, she died at
the flaming stake.
Twenty years afterward Joan of Arc s
heart-broken mother petitioned that her
daughter's soul be retaken into thÂ« guar
dianship of the church which had repu
diated her. And Charles VII. now a con
quering, victorious King, consented to an
appeal to the Pope, not because of the
gnawlngs of remorse, bat because ha
feared for the succession of a crown won
for him by one whom the church had
proved a witch. The outcome of the trial
held by the commission appointed by the
church was a formal process, a legal re
establishment of Joan's character. It la
known as the rehabilitation of VC6. After
the witness stand had meted out Its tardy
justice the people gave expression to their
appreciation by painting numberless pic
tures and by erecting numberless monu
ments to the deliverer of Franceâmonu
ments which might have passed aa bear
able supplements to the honor of a nation.
j but in the face of Joan's execution serve
I simply to emphasize one of thÂ« most cruel
I satires In the history of mankind.

BT CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN
There was a great game of political
chess played on a French board nearly
500 years ago, and during a period of
nearly 100 years many men were gained
and lost. The black men, or Burgundians.
called in the aid of a powerful English
Baron, Henry V. the Butcher of Agin
court, who captured the castles of the
white men, the Orleanists, and blocked
their game by penning their King hope
lessly in a corner. Indeed, the Orleanists
who championed the claims of Charles the
Dauphin were playing such a losing game
that, had it not been for the skillful
moves of a new player, they must have
surrendered their King in overwhelming
defeat.
This new player was an unlettered child
of 17. Alone, spirit-trained and vision
taught, she bewitched the French by the
magnetism of her earnest personality, ter
rorized the English, annulled their gains
In the hundred years' war, and hypnotized
the most unkingly man in France into
placing- the French crown upon his head.
The facts concerning Joan of Arc's vic
tories are better authenticated than those
of any other military leader, for they
come to us from the witness stand of the
great rehabilitation trial of 1456. Yes. the
results, the details of her generalship, are
duly filed and tabulated, but the main
spring, the cause of her miraculous power
âwhat was it? Was it purely the result of
ously of her newly crowned Kins to be
allowed to lay off her steel raiment an 3
return to her kinsmen, the peasant folk of
Domremy. But no; the child-command ?r
had become too valuable to France, bho

OPPOSE DUTIES ON HIDES
Local Dealers Send a Set of Resolu
tions to Congress.
The local leather men through a com
mittee apointed at a recent meeting have
forwarded a resolution to the California
delegation in Congress asking for a re
peal of the duty of 15 per cent upon hides
and for a restoration of hides to the free
list. The committee represents all lines
of the leather manufacturing of the city.
The resolutions were passed at a meet
ing of the Board of Trade, and sent forth
that the duty of 15 per cent has been
barren of results either as a protective or
revenue measure; that It has struck a
serious blow at a growing export trade
in leather and the products of allied in
dustries, which trade had been made pos
sible by free hides during the period of
twenty-five years; that the cost of the
necessities of life, into the manufacture of
which leather enters, has been Increased
artificially, and that the duty has prevent
ed the leather manufacturers from ob
taining special supplies from abroad at
certain times when such supplies were
not obtainable in the home market.

JUDGE SEAWELL
SAYS MAXWELL
HAS NO TITLE
Writ of Mandate Is
D.enied.
Judge Seawell yesterday rendered a de
cision holding that the removal of George
F. Maxwell as secretary of the Board of
Fire Commissioners was legal and in vio
lation of no provision of the charter.
Maxwell, who was relieved from his du
ties by the new board appointed by Mayor
Phelan, filed suit for a writ of mandate
to compel his reinstatement.
Maxwell in his complaint held that the
position of clerk under the old board was
identical with that of secretary under the
charter, and that consequently he could
not be removed except for cause. Judge
Seawell In his decision declares that the
charter abolishes the office of clerk and
that Maxwell has no title to the present
secretaryship. *

WHITE PLACED
O'BRIEN MONEY
ON WRONG LINE
Got Tangled In His
Betting.
"Jack" O'Brien, who "laid down" to
young "Peter Jackson," the colored
fighter, at Woodward's Pavilion on
Wednesday night, threatens to make a
punching bag of "Billy" White, his erst
while manager and confidential agent.
Now that the story of how O'Brien
"faked" the fight with Jackson is evident,
the Eastern scrapper, seeing that his
pugilistic glory has completely vanished
and that he must "go back to hard graft,"
much as he dislikes to. is making all kinds
of threats against White, claiming that
he jobbed him. The "Job" consists in
White placing O'Brien's money on the
wrong line of the paxis mutuels.
O'Brien, after consenting to fake the
fight with Jackson, agreed to go out In the
thirteenth round. He gave White all his
available money to bet on the second line,
expecting to reap a golden harvest. White
and his friend McCribbin lost no time in
visiting the poolrooms and placing the
money for O'Brien. After the fight White
learned that in all the poolrooms, except
Corbett's, the thirteenth round was in
cluded in the third line and that the big
gest portion of O'Brien's money was then
being paid over to the men who backed
the colored fighter. With tears in his eyes
White hunted up O'Brien and told him of
his mistake. Â¦ Â¦ \,-v
"It's gone. Jack, old boy." he tenderly
remarked. "The coon and hl3 friends have
copped everything in sight."
For a moment O'Brien was dazed, but
quickly recovering his power of speech, he
asked the "astute" manager how it hap
pened. The shock was so sudden to White
that he was unable to account for the loss
of the money, but promised to give a full
explanation the next day.
The more O'Brien thought of White s
stupidity the madder he grew, and allow
ing his anger to overcome him he deter
mined to get "even."
Last night he was out with blood In
his eye anxiously awaiting the opportunity
to "knock White's block off." It Is said
that White, fearing violence at the hands
of O'Brien, has gone Into hiding, but this
ia denied by the friends of the ex-mana
ger. ___Jl_^*;'
FIRM OF GRAY
AND MITCHELL
IS DISSOLVED
Interests in Business
Are Divided.
The principal topio of conversation
along the front yesterday was the disso
lution of ,the well known house of Gray &
Mitchell, wholesale lumber- dealers and
ship owners. There has been some little
friction between the partners ever since
the steamer Homer, chartered by the firm,
at so much a day, was tied up for nearly
a month in Coos Bay owing to heavy
weather. The charter of the Del Norte
also did not turn out as satisfactorily as
was expected, so a few days ago the dis
solution was decided upon. By the terms
of the agreement Mr. Gray retains all the
lumber interests of the concern, whilÂ»/Mr.
Mitchell becomes the managing owner of
the steamers.
The firm of Gray & Mitchell, composed
of George D. Gray and William A. Mitch
ell, was formed about two years ago.
During that time the nrm had built for it
the steamers Alliance, Fulton and Dis
patch, while it has now ready for launch
ing at Eureka the fine big 220-foot steamer
Nome City. Besides these vessels the firm
has under charter the steamers Homer
and Del Norte, while a few days ago it
turned back to the owners the steamer
Brunswick. The steamers over which Mr.
Mitchell will now exercise supreme com
mand are the finest of their class on the
coast, and all of them will go into tho
Nome trade in the spring. The new
steamer now nearing completion is a
larger vessel than the Humboldt and will
have cabin accommodations for over one
hundred passengers. She was originally
intended for a steam schooner, but has
been remodeled and turned into a first
class passenger steamer.
The California Ship Company has pur
chased the American ship John Currier,
now loading at Hongkong for Puget
Sound. At Tacoma she will load lumber
for Australia and will then come to San
Francisco with a load of coal. ,
John Rosenfeld's Sons have also pur
chased the American ship P. N. Blanch
ard, now loading coal at Baltimore for
San Francisco. Both vessels will go into
the coasting trade on their arrival here.
Captain Jahnsen of the steamer Samoa
has purchased the schooner Neptune from
Robert Dollar and will run her to Cape
Nome In the spring.
Captain Fischer, a well-known master
and formerly in command of a Russian
sealing schooner, went north on the
steamer Queen to take charge of the Ha
waiian ship Star of France. Captain
Wells of the Star will come to San Fran
cisco to take command of another vessel.
The mail steamer Alameda will not take
away as much cargo as usual on her next
trip. She will not be able to get any coal
at Honolulu, so enough fuel has to be
taken aboard -here to carry her to Auck
land, N. Z. She also has on board 150 tons
of merchandise for Honolulu that was
stopped at Sydney, N. S. W. This stuff
will be discharged when the vessel reaches
Honolulu, but nothing will be taken
aboard. The Rio de Janeiro, which ijoes
out to-day, will not take any cargo for
the islands, so prices of many articles
must be at starvation rates in the Para
dise of the Pacific.
Among those who will leave for Manila
on the transport Sherman to-day Is Alex
Imbrle, who has been connected with the
postofttce at the ferries for several years.
Mr. Imbrie goes to the Philippines to fill
an Important position in the postal ser
vice.
The steamer Coptic was released from
quarantine yesterday and went to the Mail
dock. The remains of Mrs. Foote were at
once landed and taken to the family resi
dence in Oakland. During the night Quar
antine Oflicer Kinyoun allowed Miss Ber
tha and Miss Enid Foote and Mrs. Taylor
to leave the Coptic. They were taken
aboard the tug Relief and landed at the
Oakland mole, whence they were taken
home in a special train.
Colonel H. Esdale was the sick man on
the steamer. He was taken down with
typhoid fever a few days ago, and owing
to his advanced age the chances are
somewhat against him. The colonel is a
member of the Welsh Fusiliers and was
given a great send-off when leaving Hong
kong by that regiment.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
has purchased the big tramp steamer Al
goa, now on her way to China from this
port. The Algoa is the largest freighter
ever seen in the bay, and her addition to
the regular line of vessels to the Orient
will help out the situation wonderfully.

TAKING OF ORLEANS BY JOAN
OF ARC.New York Stock Market.
KEW YORK. Feb. 16.â The drooping tendency
of prices proved to be too much to overcome
and the majority of Etocks show net losses
en the day. In the standard stocks these losses
are small, but the decline from the early high
ranse was considerable. The opening was
above last night' t; level in sympathy with Lon
don. but the Initial transactions, the wcak
nwe of the local traction stocks and of Pa
cific Mail 6erved to unsettle the market.
Prices sagged pretty steadily from that time
until the btar operators among the room
traders started to cover their short contracts
In the final dealings. This rallied the level of
the market from the lowest, but the move
ment was listless and entirely without force.
London was not encouraged by its good news
from South Africa to buy stocks here and in
fact price* tttÂ£gÂ«"d in the home market. Con
sols lost all uf their oarly gain, supposedly on
the Imminence of a new issue. But London
was disposed to take profits at all points,
even lUmd mines showing a sharp reaction
from the early advance. There was no oc
casion for fcurprise. Â° therefore, that the local
market failed to hold the advance on the
Boutta African news. The bears had not as
much ammunition in the Ehape of weakness
of epecial stocks as they had yesterday, but
the general tone of the market was never
theless reactionary. The bears made inroads
upon Pacific Mall and United States Rubber,
but otherwise no very wide breaches were made
in values. The local traction stocks were in
clined to rally with the cessation of pressure
tfajr.rt Third Avenue. Sugar was elastic dur
ir.K tbe early part of the day, but became
firmer toward the close with considerable ef
fect on the general list. The public main
tained Its attitude of apathy and this was the
main cause of the heaviness. Probably some
of the \arv.o uneaclness Is beginning to be felt
sJso recording the winter wheat crop, because
the ground is bare of enow to discount an un
favorable Ur.it statement, although money on
ca.l! wu in free supply at 2 per cent for the
grt-atcr part cf the day. The rt-cord shows,
however, that the banks have lost on Â»Ã¼b
treasury operation* $2,120,000. According to re
ports from the leading banks shipments of
money by express this week are nearly a mil
lion dollars greater than Ui!"t week, while the
receipt* from the interior by express huve
fallen eff considerably over a million dollars.
Th!* would Indicate a net loss on the Interior
movement cf nearly a million dollars, nuk-
Ins the total loss Including substitute treasury
operations over J3,0uy,0&0. It is known that
Hume poll has been received from Canada
vhlch Uoes not figure In this estimate. There
has been a continued absorption of money Into
;:.â¢Â¦!<: :.*l> paper and other forms of loans in
the court* of actixe business, so that a further
extension of the loan item Is locked for. A
large encroachment upon surplus reserves,
therefore, eeems unavoidable. Sterling ex
change hardened a fraction in response, to the
Ir.lgher dlfcjunt rat** in London. The declara
tion of the first dividend on the new preferred
Â¦tock of the Baltimore and Ohio was fully
expected and was without influence on the
market.
There waa a frood absorption of some dormant
railroad bond* at advanced prices, but changes
generally were irregular. There was quite an
active market for Government bonds, pre
sumably on account of the i-a*t<aÂ£e of the re
funding bill by the S*r.ate, Total saks of rail-

NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â Bradstreefs Flnanclat
Review to-morrow will 6ay: Activity In specu
lation decreased this week and the market
became decidedly more professional. The un
dertone of prices was strong and the weakness
which developed was, except in the case of
a few epeclaltles. productive of merely mod
erate recessions In prices, which were attribut
able to reallilng rather than to any renewal
of general bearlshness on the part of the large
traders. The market, however, showed a cer
tain degree of indifference to favorable news
and even failed to respond to London's cheer
ful reception of the news that the first step
In the movement of the British forces in Boer
territory has been successfully accomplished.
Including the apparent relief of Kimberley.
There continued to be an abundance of the
same kind of developments In regard to our
own railroad and Industrial Interests, which
had served as an incentive for the recent ad
vance In the market. Gross railroad earnings
for . January and for the first week of Feb
ruary show In most cases large Increases and
there haa been further tangible confirmation
of the belief that Industrial companies, par
ticularly those identified with the steel and
Iron trade, are making remarkable profits. The
preliminary statement of the Federal Steel
Company was a leading example and there
were the usual sanguine reports about the
showing that would be made by other concerns
of the same kind and the dividends which
their common shareholders might expect. In
some Instances the Industrial stocks responded
moderately to the circulation of such reports,
but the group as a whole waa Influenced more
by a disposition to take profits on the part
of those who bought In the recent slump than
by the appearance of fresh buying. In the
railroad list, while the trunk line shares were
exceptionally strong and well supported, there
waa also a good deal of Irregularity, and when
the market, as was several times the case,
became dull, a tendency for prices to sag oft
developed. Specialties and manipulated stocks
frequently attained prominence, and although
the market at large was not particularly In
fluenced by the irregular fluectuatlons In Amer-
lean Sugar it paid some attention to the per
formance In Third Avenue shares and was on
Thursday afternoon visibly unsettled when the
stock broke quite sharply on news that the
bankers who were to -finance the floating debt
had withdrawn from the arrangements. Money
was continued sufficiently easy for Wall street
to disregard the large Increase In loans and
decrease in the surplus reserve shown by last
Saturday's bank statement or the Intimations
that money is no longer coming from the In
terior to New York. -Favorable comments on
the probable effects of the currency bill should
It speedily^ becoma a law am beard In many

Harrison's Circular says: "During the week
there have been six arrivals of Coal from Wash
ington. 16.500 tons; four from British Columbia.
14.312 tons, and two from Oregon. 1050 tons; to
tal. 31,562 tons. Fortunately our deliveries for
the- past two weeks were heavy, or we would
have had a serious deficit locally. Our fuel
stock Is a hand-to-mouth one; the amount here
; has to be finessed to satisfy consumers and
: make a sparse division with each; It Is a aeii-
I ous strain upon both the distributor and the re
; celver. Prices remain stationary; no advantage
Is being taken of the situation; Importers deem
It prudent not. to disturb values too markedly.
Inflated values would naturally lnctea.se foreign
shipments, besides creating labor disturbance
at points of production; hence. In the long ru:>.
the present policy !;â¢ probably the more JuJl
clous. As the weather has moderated sor.ie
what, the demand for household coals will nec
essarily diminish, which may enable the whole
sale dealers to accumulate a little stock tn their
yards. Our chances for shipments of foreign
Krades from Great Britain or Australia, are
monthly becoming more unfavorable, notwith
standing the present seductive grain freights
now ruling In former years, with the present
grain freight tariff now existing, we would
have had a liberal Influx of foreign coals from

London Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
The news of the relief of Kimberley caused a
booming opening in the markets here to-day,
De Beers rising IM. Business, however, was
most meager, provincial orders being stopped
by serious Interruptions In the telegraphic ser
vice and prices gradually dropped. Lord Rosu
bery's speech In Parliament yesterday induced
apprehensions In- some quarters of Impending
foreign complications. Consols, which began
at 101^4, were pressed down by heavy cash sales
of 100 H. and they closed at only H better. The
selling of consols was supposed to be in an
ticipation of the financial statement to be made
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer next Mon
day.
Americans began 1 per cent up but In the
absence of New York support slipped away
steadily to the close. The trading In this de
partment to-day was the dullest we have had
for j-ears.
Money was nominally unchanged, but there
was an easier tendency and few bills were
offered. The bank lost Â£200.000 gold, engaged
for shipment to the Cape.
The copper fortnightly statistics show stocks
unchanged and supplies increased by 1400 tons.
The Bank of Bombay has reduced Us mini
mum discount rate from 9 to 8 per cent.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Feb. 16.â The wheat market
opened easy on heavy Argentine shipments and
lower cables, May %@Uc depressed at 68',*Â®
68% c. There was little doing in cash wheat,
export demand was not encouraging and May
gradually sold off to 6S%Â®6S%c. The decline
was helped along by the weakness of corn.
At the bottom some demand from commission
houses caused a reaction to 6S*Â»c. The close
was weak. May %c down at 6S%c. Except for
some activity during the first hour and the
last thirty minutes the session was quiet.
The corn market yielded to heavy sales for
profit-taking by recent heavy buyers and con
sidering the deluge the price held pretty well.
Country offerings generally were reported
small. May closed %@*jc down at 34Â»4c.
Oats receded with the other grain markets.
The cash demand was poor. May closed VÂ»c
under yesterday.
The weakness of corn and selling by longs
depressed the provision market, which closed
barely steady. Trade was quiet. There was
covering of pork and lard and a little nibbling
at lard by exporters. May pork closed 2%@5c
down. May lard a shade down and May ribs
closed a shade lower.

NDTV YORK. Feb. IS.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row will say: Satisfactory advices as to ex
panding spring trade In dry goods and kindred
lines come from a number of markets. That
the aggregate business of the country is of
good volume otherwise Is, however, indicated
by detailed reports of increases in trade, as
compared with last year, confirmed by satisfac
tory railroad earning reports, by fair gains in
bank clearings and by reports of better demand
for money in commercial channels. A year ago,
it rray be recalled, extremely stormy weather
was experienced, and some effects, notably
those on winter-sown crops, were very unfavor
able. This year opposite conditions have ruled,
and though some talk of lack of snow In grain
erowlng regions is heard, no widespread dam
age from cold weather is yet noted. In fact,
unseasonably mild weather has had an appre
ciable effect on several industries, notably those
engaged in the manufacture of footwear, in
discouraging sales of the same, actually causing
the shutdown of some rubber manufactures,
and also in the lumber and Ice business. The
scarcity of snow In the Northwest will unques
tionably affect the log-cutting season, and a
firmer tone as to values Is already perceptible,
notwithstanding talk of labor troubles affecting
the building trades.
Heavy rains and afterward floods have affect
ed business and transportation In New England
and Northern New York this week, and Cotton
and other mills reporting lack of water as a
reason for restricted operations a few weeks
ago have been interfered with thi6 week by the
extremely high level of the streams from which
they derive power.
The foreign demand for Iron and Steel seems
likely to have a most Important effect upon
prices of the domestic product. It Is conceded
that any Important concession in value would
be met by a heavy enlarged export movement.
American Piglron prices are steadily held, the
only weakness noted being manifested at the
East. Concessions in Southern prices are
claimed not to extend beyond one furnace. Con
siderable orders for Piglron have been placed at
full prices, and Northern coko Iron particularly
has moved well In the central East. Steel rails
are well held, a fair business being reported at
the West: but plates are weak. In spite of a
heavy business. Spring trade prospects In Hard
ware are good, best reports coming from the
West. The placing of a large order for Copper
by New England manufacturers at 16 cents Is
regarded as a guarantee that the price will be
maintained. Tin is higher, having reached 30
cents this week on improved demand and In
creased foreign speculative Interest.
Some shading in raw Sugar prices Is to be
noted, notwithstanding considerable business
done; but the refined grades, are firmly held,
and refiners Insist on shorter delivery periods.
Coffee is fractionally lower also, as are Lard
and Butter.
Wheat (lncludlnc Flour) shipments for the
week aggregate 3.834.0C9 bushels, against 2.902.
357 bushels last week. 2.454.771 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1599, 3.032.744 bushels in
ISSS. 2,i:0,536 bushels In 1837 and 3,149.012 bushels
In 1596.
Failures for the week In the United States
number 199. as compared with 231 last week, 160
in this week a year ago, 2C9 in IS9S. 825 in ISÂ»7
and 276 in 1596. Failures for the week In the
Dominion of Canada number 35, as compared
with 25 last week, 20 In this week a year ago. 3S
in 189S and 58 in 1597 and 1896. respectively.
Butter. Eggs and Cheese are all cheaper.
There Is no particular change In Poultry or
Meat. Game Is still cheaper, and will be out of
season on the Ist of March. Doves are already
out.
Fruits and Vegetables are about the same aa
last week. Receipts of Asparagus and Rbubarb
are still slender and prices are high.

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 16.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly. Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Business continued larger than ever at this
season In amount of payments and on the
whole as large as ever In retail deliveries,
though new transactions do not yet give as
surance that It will hold at the same rate.
Conditions affecting new orders and contracts
have changed In some respects most favor
ably, while other conditions tend to restrict
operations for a time, but a conservative judg
ment of the conflicting tendencies appear to
warrant strong hope. Important branches of
business are hindered by labor troubles, of
which the building trades strike at Chicago
affects the greatest number of contracts for
industrial products and the labor and wages
of the greatest number of men. Circumstances
do not yet promise Its speedy ending and In
Borne other branches of Industry prosperity
and advanced prices seem to have rendered
controversies more frequent. But In other
branches declining prices or such decrease of
orders as may lead to stoppage of works have
an opposite tendency.
The rise in wheat brings out larger Western
receiptsâ ln two weeks 5.444.192 bushels, against
6,236,166 bushels last yearâ but Atlantic exports,
flour Included, In the same weeks have been
only 3.645.40S bushels, against 6.192.407 bushels
last year. The price closed half a cent higher
for the week.
The suit of Mr. Frlck against the Carnegie
Company to obtain an accounting and settle
ment discloses enormous profits made when
prices of steel products doubled last year, but
when peace was kept by the gigantic Iron and
steel combination. That results of great Im
portance may spring from a contest affecting
the control of so many Iron works Is evident.
The new sheet company has the united owner
ship of 160 mills It Is said, but four widely
known concerns controlling sixty-five mills re
fused to Join. Prices of pig have not changed,
though considerable sales. Including some for
export, are reported, but the excess of supply
over demand which appeared In January Is
Increased by the starting of a new furnace
with a capacity of 600 tons daily. A sale Is
reported of 13,000,000 pounds of Calumet and
Hecla copper to consumers of the Naugatuck
Valley at 16 cents.
Heavy sales of leather at Boston, exceeding
100,000 sides, at a reduction of %c In price,
with unusually large sales of hides at Chicago,
also at lower prices. Indicate that the dealers
and consumers who have looked for cheaper
boots and shoes may be satisfied. Heavy im
ports of hides at New York have some In
fluence and are part due to the famine in
India. Shipments of shoes since February 1
have been 28,000 cases, or nearly 20 per cent
larger than In the two weeks of any other
year, but many of the works are nearly out
of orders.
Wool sales at three Eastern markets have
been only 12,324,456 pounds In two weeks,
BKalnsl 12,635,600 pounds last year. The in
terior still believes In a further advance, but
buying of wool on sheeps' backs has stopped
and the manufacturer has made It clear that
the mills hold large stocks to fill recent orders.
Cancellations become so numerous as to cause
Borne uneasiness, but as yet only help mills
which have taken more orders than they can
mi.
Failures for two weeks have been $3,337,170;
manufacturing. 52.356.253: trading, $2,563,600.
Failures for the week have been 218 In the
United States against 178 last year, and 42 In
Canada against IS last year.

WANT WHEELER
TO INFLUENCE
THEIR COACH
*
Students Turn to
Their President.
BERKELEY, Feb. 16.â The student ath
letic committee of the University of Cali
fornia has decided to write a letter to
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, wha U
now In the East, concerning a football
coach for next year. The committee ia
in a quandary as to what to do. as "Ad"
Kelly has refused the offer of $1500. Hiide
brand. the famous Princeton tackle, has
also declined an offer from California be
cause of a previous engagement It is the
idea of the student committee to have
President Wheeler use his influence to In
duce Kelly or Hildebrand to come to Cali
fornia.
The student body is in favor of "Ad"
Kelly, who assisted in coaching the vic
torious team last year. He is familiar
with the existing conditions and would
have a natural advantage. However. H:i
debrand is one of the three best men ever
brought out by Princeton. Cochran and
Lee being the others. President Whseler
Is an enthusiast In athletic matters and
will probably do something along the lines
suggested in the committee's letter.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 16.â An epidemic cf
seasickness has struck the people of Ala
meda. It has not been caused by the
rocking of the ferry-boats, but by th<? ec
centric behavior of the cars of the Oak
land Transit Company. And now Dr. C.
H. Lubbock, a member of the Board of
Health, has interested himself in the mat
tor and has made an Investigation of the
cars and roadbed.
Dr. Lubbock said yesterday:
"Several of my women patients have
been made car-sick through riding on the
care of the branch lines, particularly tho
High street line. Carsickness is similjr
to seasickness, and has the same disagree
able effect. The service is simply abom
inable. The cars rock a good deal worse
than ferry-boats in rough weather. They
pitch and bump and tear around the
tracks at a terrible rate. I don't womler
people get that funny feeling when riding.
"The trouble lies with the Inadequate
cars and poorly maintained rojull.ed. The
cars on the branch lines are equipped
with elngle trucks. They ought to have
double trucks â four wheels at t-ach en'l.
The roadbed is like the rocky road to
Dublin. I don't suppose It has been fixed
since it was built. The tracks are loose-
Jointed and out of shape. It's miraculous
how the cars ktep the tracks. One did
jump the tracks last Monday and ran
down a drugstore. The Transit Company
claims the branches do not pay, but tl>at
is no reason why the daylight should be
shaken out of patrons.
"The jolting of the cars is bound to re
sult in the injury of health, aside from
the fact that passengers are robbed of all
comfort. It is harmful to the health in
various ways. Car men In charge of HlÃh
street cars Â£ay they can't stand them
more than a month, and they are always
glad when they are relieved. I hope we
will be able to do something Â¦with the raU
road people and bring about a change."
POETUM rrr.-n.-g at.
MAN AND WIFE.
SeÂ« Changes as They Change.
To sweeten sour human nature, one
of the best methods is to leave off coffee
if it gives you dyspepsia or makes you
nervous.
"I asked husband this morning to
write out a testimonial for the Postum
Cereal Co.. and from it I quote: 'I am
pleated to be able to state that my wife
has been cured of sick headaches and
"general cussedness" by leaving off cof-
fee and using your Postum Food Cof-
fee. My home is now a happy one.'
"I am forced to admit his joke con-
tains more than a modicum of truth, for
I find now I have complete control of
my nerves, while formerly I was often
irritable, and husband himself has been
entirely cured of insomnia by leaving
off coffee and taking up Postum. He
bleeps now like a baby from the time he
rocs to bed until morning; and perhaps
his improvement is partly a reason for
his seeing such an improvement in me
At any rate, our old sickness and
troubles have disappeared.
"I had tried everything for my sick
headaches, but as long as I stuck to the
coffee the headaches stuck to me. It
took us a little while to learn that we
must follow the directions in making
Postum in order to obtain a really pal-
atable, delicious beverage. People must
get over the idea that they can make it
in any kind of a slipshod way and have
it pood. The great element in making
good Postum is to allow it plenty of
time to boil. That is certainly simple
enough, and when the cook becomes ac-
customed to making Postum one can
drpend upon a regular quality every
morning.
"I know people who seem to >be
able to drink coffee, with no bad ef-
fects; and on the other hand I know that
probably one-half of all my friends are
more or less unpleasantly affected with
coffee, when they persist in using it, but
Postum has obtained a strong hold
since its qualities have become known,
and a great many of our friends are
steady users of Postum in place of the
ordinary coffee, and you may be sure
even.- family that has used Postum for
even one month will be ready to testify
to the improvement in health.
"If you should publish this letter
please suppress my name, as I have a
horror of undue notoriety. If any one
will take the trouble to write you for
riy name and address I will cheerfully
answer any questions that may be
asked, and furnish satisfactory evidence
to substantiate my statements. Re-
spectfully," Mrs. , Hyde Park,

cream and cake?, were served. The Sun
day-school rooms of the church, where
the reception was given, were decorated
In a very novel way. Portieres of emilax,
tiny srspended pink and white heirrts and
Japanese lanterns separated them and a
profusion of violets, wild flowers and
China lilies were arranged on the piano
and elsewhere. The gas Jets were
twined with smllax and pink roses. The
effect was extremely artistic and was the
background for the reception committee
of young ladies In dainty gowns. This
committee was also the committee of ar
rangements, and consisted of Miss Mabel
McCutcheon, Miss Minnie Walton, Miss
Claire Walton, Miss Bessie Lancaster,
Miss Ellen Fearn. Miss Nettie Downing,

Fearn a vocal solo and Miss Vivian
Clark, Miss Claire Walton and Miss
Noble reciting. Over seventy-flve young
gentlemen were received and the total
attendance was over 200. At the con
clusion of the evening dainty hand-paint
ed heart-shaped souvenirs were distrib
uted. The society is one of the largest in
Oakland, and contains some very Well
known and popular young people.
The concert to-night by the Hughes
Club was one of the musical events of the
year and drew a large and fashionable
audience to the First Congregational
Church. It was the first of the fourth

TEMPORARY LULL IN
KENTUCKY DISPUTE
Injunction Suits Will Probably Be
Consolidated and Heard in
One Court.
FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. 16.â The agree
ment entered into at Georgetown to-day,
by which the Taylor and Beckham injunc
tion suits were postponed until February
22. is to operate as a truce in the legal
battle over the .State offices, and it is not
probable that there will be any decisive
changes In the situation until then unles.*
the return of the Democratic Legislature
hero next week adds some unexpected
feature.
A part of the attorneys on both sides
held a meeting this afternon and discussed
several plans for consolidating the vari
ous injunction cases, in order to avoid a
clash between the different State courts
in which they are pending; but a llnal
understanding was not reached. A propo
sition, which is said to have met with fa
vor, Is that all of the cases be consolidat
ed and be submited to a Judge of one of
the neighboring Circuit Court districts,
excluding both the Jefferson County and
Franklin County courts.
BILL POSTERS LOSE.
High. Fences Must Come Down in
San Jose.
Special Dlsrateh to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 16.â The city ordinance
limiting the height of bill boards' to ten
feet was sustained by Judge Rhodes of
the Superior Court to-day. This decision
was made on a demurrer of the City At
torney to an injunction asked by Slebe &
Green, San Francisco bill posters, to en-
Join the Chief of Police and City Council
from removing their bill boards.
A few months ago Siebe & Green in
vaded San Jose and began to erect high
signboards on all the streets of the city.
The local bill posters objected to outside
competition and had the Council pass an
ordinance limiting all signboards to ten
feet and at the same time to raise the
license for outside bill posters. Slebe &,
Green's billboards were over twenty feet
high, and the firm at once carried the
matter into court to test the ordinance.
Judge Rhodes to-day decided that the
height of the billboards is a police regula
tion and dissolved the temporary Injunc
tion granted in the case. Unless an appeal
Is tnken to the Supreme Court these sign
boards must now come down.
BURGLARS SENTENCED.
Two Men Who Were Implicated in
Fifty Robberies.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 16. â James Bassett
and Howard Holland, two burglars, who
created a reign of terror for a couple of
weeks this winter, were to-day sent to
San Quentin by Judge Lorlgan. Holland
received eight years and Bassett seven
years. These two participated In nearly

COUNCIL CLEARS
THE COURSE FOR
MUCH BUSINESS
Action Decided Upon
Many Matters.
OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â President Watkln
son of the Contra Costa "Water Company
had to go to Berkeley this evening and
was not present at the meeting of the
committee of the whole of the Oakland
City Council. For that reason the water
rate question was not discussed, but the
Council went into executive session and
there a long list of public questions were
discussed and action decided upon, but all
behind closed doors.
There was gome little discussion of
plans for the water rate discussion and it
was decided to ask the Water Committee
of the Council to report a rate ordinance
upon which the committee of the whole
could work. This ordinance is to be pre
sented by next Friday night, when the
committee of the whole will meet once
more to question Mr. Watkinson.
It was decided that an election for free
holders to frame a new charter was advis
able, but that it could not be held during
the present fiscal year owing to the lack
of funds. The necessary preliminary or
dinances will be adopted shortly, so that
the freeholders' election can proceed at
once after the new fiscal year opens.
The matter of granting liquor licenses
will be placed In the hands of the Police
and Fire Commissioners. It was decided
to pass the necessary ordinances to that
effect.
The application of the ladles of the Oak
land Club to have a matron appointed for
the City Prison will be referred to the
Police and Fire Commissioners for a rec
ommendation.
Captain Roberts, who owns the wells
which have been offered to the city, made
a proposition to the Council that he would
sink a well 200 feet deep at his own ex
pense if the city would test it. This mat
ter was referred to the Board of Public
Works for a recommendation as to the
course to be pursued.
Councilman Taylor brought up the mat
ter of surveys of Lake Meriitt, and It was
decided to ask City Engineer Clement to
furnish the' surveys, which he made a
year ag-o, to the new commission that is
to survey the lake.
It was asserted that there were many
pieces of work ordered by the city which
the City Engineer had not completed, but
upon which ! he had drawn some money.
Mr. Clement will be asked on Monday to
make an exp'a nation of this work. " Â¦

BROWN THINKS
MANY WIVES
PURSUE HIM
Strange Malady of an
Oakland Man.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 16.
That a multitude of wives is pursuing
him is the strange hallucination of K.
W. Brown, a laborer, who was arrested
i his morning in East Oakland and taken
to the Receiving Hospital for examina
tion as to his sanity. When arrested
Brown said his given name was Manuel,
but later admitted that he had assumed
the name to prevent his wives following
him to prison.
"'The reason they pursue me so relent
lessly," said he. "is that they think I
have money. This is a mistake, and I
liave told them all so. but still they pur
sue m*. I have gone from place to place
in an effort to avoid them, and once I
took a sea voyage, but it Is all useless.
I would willingly go to an a?ylum if I
thought I could avoid them in that way.
Brown is 2S years old and says his home
ie in Boston, Mass. He cays he was
married there to a Miss Tillie McCar
thy. He will be examined by a lunacy
commission composed of Drs. Child and
Dodge.
Mrs. Matilda P. Oleon of Lorln, a come
ly woman of 27 years, was recommended
for commitment to an asylum this

from an attack of typhoid fever, which

that her neighbors are trying to murder
her two little children, and at times she
becomes violent.

CANCERS DISAPPEAR
BEFORE THE X-RAY
Dr. N. H. Chamberlain Working on
Three Aggravated Cases of the
ATTection.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 16. â¢
THAT the X-ray treatment prescribed
and administered by Dr. Is*. H.
Chamberlain to Dr. J. M. Selfridge.
founder of the Fabiola Hospital, for
the removal and eradication of a cancer
ous affection on the face has been effica
cious there can be no doubt. The process
employed and the results achieved will
be the means of starting a new mode of
medical treatment for cancer which will
probably revolutionize all former meth
ods.
Dr. Chamberlain Is now attending to
throe distinct cases of cancer, for all of
which he has prescribed the X-ray treat
ment. The case of Dr. Selfridge is the
only one up to date in which what ap
pears a complete cure has been effected.
The diseased portion of his face was sub
jected to the strong light of the X ray on
October 12 for the first time. For nine
days the application waa administered
daily; then three times a week till the
present time. No pain attends the pro
cess, nor is it fraught with any danger.
All that remains as a mark of the can
cerous growth is the scar and the thin,
delicate covering of Bkln.
Dr. Chamberlain's second case is that of
John Webster, a well known resident of
Haywards. Webster has been afflicted
for teh years with a cancer thaf covers
the right temple and right eyelid, and at
the time of the first X-ray application
was eating its way into his nose. He has
been under treatment for a month, and
the same improvement noted in the Sel-
fridge case has shown Itself In Webster's
case.
The third case is that of Angus McKln
non of Stockton. Hearing of the wonder
ful success of the treatment prescribed
for Dr. Selfridge he sought the same
treatment from Dr. Chamberlain and is
now one of his patients.
McKinnon's case is the most aggravated
and Fevere of them all. His mouth was
swollen beyond all form and natural
shupe â a large growing ulcer. According
to Dr. Chamberlain, one week of treat
ment has reduced all the swelling, de
stroyed the odor of the ulcer and given
evidences of as complete a recovery as
was experienced in Dr. Selfridge's case.
Dr. Chamberlain is of the opinion that
this caee will be the crucial test of the
process as a curative for cancers.
The most marvelous feature of this new
treatment is the manner In which the dis
ease is removed. The process is the re
verse of cauterization. Under the repeat
ed application of the X-ray the disease
seems to pass out of. the tissue, leaving it
healthy and sound. There is no cutting,
no actual destruction of flesh. It is like
the evanescence of the disease Itselfâ a
kind of absorption by the X-rays. In all
other processes for the removal of cancer
there is a destruction of the tissue and a
consequent limitation upon similar treat
ment. According to Dr. Chamberlain,
there is no limit to the X-ray process.
There being no pain and no injury to
other parts of the body, there is neces
sarily no limitation to the application,
even though the cancer should reappear
at some subsequent time.
Dr. Chamberlain is firm in the belief
that he has hit upon a wonderful dis
covery and that he has effected by means
of the use of the X-ray a permanent cure
In the cancer case of Dr. Selfridge.

WARD WILL
NOT FIGHT THE
DIVORCE SUIT
Alameda Society Is
Shocked.
A LAM EDA, Feb. 16. â Alan Ward will
not flffht the suit for divorce Mrs. Dicka
Cool Ward has brought against him. He
says he will allow the action brought
against him to go by default, although he
has filed, through his attorney, a general
denial of the specifications contained in
the complaint.
Mrs. Ward demands $60 a month ali
mony. This amount young Ward is well
able to pay, as he holds a lucrative posi
tion in San Krancisco. and his father is
a wealthy mining man.
â¢â¢Anything I shall nay about the di
vorce," said Mr. Ward to-day, "would
only make matters worse. The public
is in possession of the main facts and
that ought to be sufllclent. I can only say
that we were both focls. If Mrs. Ward
thinks she is doing the right thing by
making allegations of faithlessness I am
perfectly willing to let her think so. I
intend to let the suit go by default and
I suppose I'll have to pay the $G0 a
month."
The publication of the divorce suit has
caused considerable gossip in local so
ciety, of which young Ward is a popular
member. He has always been prominent
at society functions and especially as a
leader at the Tuesday night cotillons.

tendered a reception to T. â¬ Daniel Frawley
at Its lodgerooms after the performance
of "An Unconventional Honeymoon" last
night. It was an Elk affair, but not a
stag party, for there were many ladies
present, including those of the Frawley
company. The lodgerooms, which are
particularly well appointed, were filled
with guests and refreshments were served
from several decorated tables.
There was no programme, and after Mr.
Frawley had been introduced by Exalted
Ruler Manning the affair took the shape
of an informal- reception, at which the
bonds of brotherhood" were cemented and
an abundance of mutual good will was
expressed.

COWARDICE THE
CHARGE AGAINST
OFFICER NORTON
Accused by a Fellow
Policeman.
HIS STAR IN DANGER
GOT COLD FEET DURING A
HOT SCRAP.
?
Patrolman Porter Left to Battle
Alone With a Ruffian Whom
He Had Under
Arrest.
Police Officer Norton of the Seventeenth
street station is in deep disgrace. For
mal charges of cowardice have been pre
ferred against him and if what his su
perior officers say is true he will have
a hard time in saving his star.
A short time ago a young man named
Ford, while under the influence of liquor,
created a disturbance at Twenty-fifth and
Florida streets. Norton and a. fellow-offi
cer named Porter were standing a short
distance away and, seeing the disturb
ance, they started to arrest Ford. The
latter made a determined resistance,
striking Porter in the face and trying to
butt Norton. The latter at this Juncture
got cold feet and retreated amid the jeers
or the onlookers, leaving' his brother offi
cer to battle alone with the drunken ruf
w v v? cIe I a desperate struggle, during
which his face was severely battered and
nis uniform irreparably ruined. Porter se
cured a half Nelson hold on Ford and
threw him to the ground. After he had
securely handcuffed him Norton, seeing
that the trouble was over, returned to the
scene and with a triumphant cry snapped
his handcuffs on the prisoner's wrists
against the protest of his fellow-police
man.
Ford was then hustled in the patrol
wagon and removed to the Seventeenth
street station. On seeing the condition
of Porter Captain Gillen asked him for
an explanation. Porter told of his fight
with the prisoner and Norton's apparent
cowardice in deserting him after hostili
ties commenced. Glllln then ordered Por
ter to prefer charges against Norton.
The accused policeman emphatically de
nied that he ran away after being struck
by Ford. He says he was temporarily
disabled In the first round by a kick in
the stomach and that he was forced to
retreat in order to recover his wind. He
returned to the encounter, he says, in a
very brief space of time and assisted in
placing Ford In the patrol wagon.
The hearing of the charges will come
up before the Commissioners at their next
meeting. Porter, has subpenaed a num
ber.'of spectators to the scrap who. It. ls
claimed , will swear positively that Nor
ton took to bis heels after being struck a
THE Investigation of the Spring Val
ley Water Company by the Board
of Supervisors reached last night a
practical conclusion, and on next
Friday night the board will prob-
ably begin the actual fixing of the.
rates. The cession last night was of ex
ceptional Interest, particularly in those
phase? of it in which an attempt wis
made to establish a total valuation of
the holdings of the corporation. Repre
sentatives of the company who gave testi
mony lnslFt that the property, exclusive
of the franchise, which ie so heavily
taxed, is worth at least JSO.W.OOO. and
that a 6 per cent interest on J26.000.000 or
J27.000.000 should b<? guaranteed by the
city. Mayor Phelan. a? far as his ques
tions commit him to a statement, believes
that the guaranteed interest should be
allowed or.ly on a valuation of JIS.OOCW.
or. at the most. Ca.WO.OOO.
While Pelham W. Ames, secretary of
the Spring Valley "Water Company, -was
on the rtand giving a detailed statement
of the revenue ar.d current and running
expenses of the corporation the discussion
look a general turn, in which Attorney
KÂ«riopp. Hermann Schussler. the Mayor
and several Supervisors took an active
part. This discussion proved to be one
cf the most interesting phases of the ses
sion, its motive being to determine the
one critical point of the whole Investiga
tion.
This objective point is the value of the
property of the Spring Valley Water
Company. If that can be determined the
rest is eajFy sailing, as the Supervisors
ere pledged to g!ve the corporation a 5
per cent interest tipon its investment.
Hermann Schussler. the chief engineer of
the company, succeeded in interrupting
the examination of Mr. Ames, which was
concerned minutely with an analysis of
expenses, operating expenditures, bond
JntcreÂ«=t and costs of new work. Schus
eler declared that the problem is a com
paratively easy one. He said that the
Board of Supervisors certainly can find
some way In which to give the company
a fOMt Income on a fair valuation of Its
property. He declared that too much
had already been done by the local au
thorities to injure the credit of the com
pany, to discourage it in the field in
which it labors and to jeopardize the In
terests of the stockholders.
"Oh. but they are gamblers." inter
rupted the Mayor, "and must take their
chances."
"Perhaps." said Schussler, with a shrug
cf his shoulders, and resumed his dlscus
eion. He ln?lÂ«ted that the city has now
enormous power and should look upon
the water company as an agent in whose
success the city is interested. He asked
what possible reason there can be In an
effort to ruin the works which are ad
mittedly the standard in the United
States.
This brought Supervisor Reed to his
feet with a volley of questions. He in
sisted that the company not only wants
a 5 pÂ«r cent Income on the value of its
holdings, but upon its mortgages, bonds,
stock, interest, expenditures, taxes and
running expenditures as well.
Bchussl<--r replied quickly that if mort
gages and the expenditure of money rais
ed by the bonds contribute to the value
of the holding then they certainly should
draw interest as forming part of the
company's property. But Supervisor
Reed was not dismayed. He aFked Schus
eW to give the board a statement of
values. The engineer at first said he
was unable to do so. tut it seemed to be
the critical point of the entire Inquiry.
still unpaid, and he thought It was ab
solutely uncollectible, and he voiced the
opinion that at the end of this fiscal year
the water company would not get a cent.
Chief Clerk Booker stepped forward at
that moment and called attention to the
bills that the Mayor had trimmed "with
a sharp pruning knife, and the Mayor de
fended himself by saying that they ex
ceeded the appropriation.
Mr. Kellogg was asked by the Mayor
whether $60 for each hydrant was not a
fair price, and his reply caused laughter.
He paused a moment and in a half whis
per said: "If you were to ask me pri
vately I would say I would rather have
a rate for hydrants less and charge the
householders more, because we can collect
rrcm them, but not from the city."
"But you don't collect some of your
bills from the householders," persisted the
Mayor.
"Well," answered Attorney Kellogg,
we furnish them water, and if they can't
pay it, why we let it go."
"And I presume you include these un
paid^ bills In your charity account?"
"No, sir; our charity account represents
what we spend in assisting our old and
disabled employes, or when they are dead
in helping to defray the expenses of <helr
burial." J
Mr. Ames was invited to the witness
stand a second time, and the Mayor asked
mm if he had brought an itemized adver
tising account. He replied that he had
not brought the necessary information.
He was then asked and named the boar*
of directors and he was further asked to
state the number of shares held by each
He answered that he could not do it from
memory.' The Mayor in his next ques
tion tried tp show that the directors indi
vidually held very few shares in the com
pany, but he was contradicted by Mr
Ames who stated that Thomas Brown
and Homer S. King each represented
many thousand shares.
"Stock Is held by a great many people
Â°, Â£Â°, , not attend the meetings of the
stockholders?"
"There are a great many stockholders "
was the reply.
The Mayor reverted to the advertising
account. He expressed the wish that th"
witness secure the much wanted informa
tion. He said that the city had a right
to know how the money had been spent
bupervisor Brandenstein took his cue from
the Mayor s remarks and made a motion
to have Mr. Ames furnish the member?
of the board with an itemized account As
there was no seconding voice heard the
Mayor turned to Supervisor Curtis and
told him to second the motion, which he
accordingly did.
An informal discussion then followed, in
Â«l cn i , Attorney Kellogg participated. He
said the company had no trouble with
the ratepayers and he did not think they
wanted relief. "We have eighty-seven
thousand consumers," he said. "Out of
that lot only one person has complained
of the rates, and that was a shipper, who
did so through his bookkeeper. It only
shows that we are doing satisfactory
work at a satisfactory price."
Mr. Schussler then asked the commit
tee whether it was satisfied with his val
uation and if they were not he would
prove it to them. "I am satisfied." he
said, "that the water works is worth in
excess of thirty million dollars "
John H. Bullock, the bookkeeper of a
shipping firm, referred to earlier In the
meeting by Attorney Kellogg, was then
placed on the stand and testified to rates
paid by his employer for water which
was sent out of the city. He was sub
jected to a sharp cross-examination by
Mr. Kellogg, and In the midst of it Su
pervisor Tobln arose and stated that the
members of the committee were satisfied
with the information already elicited and
the witness was excused.
The committee then reported progress
and adjourned to meet next Friday even
ing to resume its investigation into water
rates.

DEATH OF ONE
OF CALIFORNIA'S
MILLIONAIRES
A. P. Hotaling Joins

HE SUCCUMBS TO PARALYSIS
AMASSED A LARGE FORTTJXE BY
VARIOUS ENTERPRISES.
The Heirs to His Estate Are the
Widow and Two Sons â Funeral
to Be Held Next Sunday
Morning.
A. P. Hotallng, the multi-millionaire
business man and banker, died in his
home, at 1776 California street, last even-
Ing, after an illness of nearly two years*
duration. The Immediate cause of his
death was heart failure, resultant from an
attack of paralysis, from which he had
bo long suffered.
jj The deceased was attended up to the
hour of hiÂ» death by Drs. Chlsmore and
Henry F- Gibbons Jr. They <31d every
thing tor their patient that medical
science could suggest, but It was no use.
His race had been run, his time had come
and nothing that human skill could sug
fest was able to prolong his life beyond
is allotted time.
- Mr. Hotallng: leaves no will, as his es
tate was incorporated some time ago un
der the management of his sons. Its ex
act value is not known, but those who
should be Informed say that it is one of
the richeet ever accumulated In Califor
nia, and reaches somewhere between the
seven and ten million . dollar mark. ThÂ«
sole heirs to this great fortune are the
widow and the two sonsâ Richard M. and
Frederick C. Hotallng.
- Anson Parsons Hotallng was born in
New York in 1527. He came from the
old Knickerbocker 'stock, one of his an
cestors on his father's side being the
famous Dutch navigator Hendrtck Hud
son, after whom the famous river was
named. English blood, from the maternal
Fide, also flowed in his veins, making him
a typical American. When very young
he was thrown upon his own resources,
but the Eastern farm and country store
were not to his Uking. and when about 25
years of age Mr. Hotallng came to the
golden West on the ship Racehound,
which rounded the Horn and landed the
young New Yorker in San Francisco in
1552.
Soon after arriving here Mr. Hotallng
went to the mines, out this not suiting
his fancy he returned to this city and
laid, the foundation of the great spirit and
liquor business which in part made him a
millionaire four times over. He started

After a motion was carried by which ail
members agreed to go before the Super
visors next Monday and protest against
the turning out of the city lights an ad
journment was taken until the day named.
Mayor Phelan's inquiry Mr. Kellogg said
he did not think It was contemplated to
issue more stock, and he had never heard
it mentioned.
Out of which fund," the witness was
asked, 'did you draw to pay your dlvf
de â¢Js last year, outside of your receipts?*
On our credit of profit and loss," he
replied.
"You paid cut $33,745 91 more than you
earned?" "Yes, sir; it had been earned in
previous years."
During the examination Mr. Schussler,
In answer to an inquiry made of him by
Supervisor Reed, delivered a long and ear
nest talk to the board in which he gave
an expert's explanation of the magnitude
or the Spring Valley Water Company's
efforts to give this city pure water. He
said that in an isolated town like San
â¢Francisco the most important considera
tion is to secure w*ter. "If we failed to
supply this town with water," he said,
pestilence would come here. We ought
to be encouraged in every way. I feel,
and we all feel, that this constant hammer
ing at our works has caused great incon
venience. It has been difficult for us to
borrow money. By reason of these in
quiries we have to tell the public what
improvements are contemplated, what our
future intentions are, and this has fre
quently worked hardships."
The speaker then went on to tell of the
great expense the company is put to In
bringing water from distant points; how
land must be bought, water rights must
be obtained and countless other necessary
matters settled so as to give the public
an abundant water supply. The Mayor
interrupted Mr. Schussler to inform him
tnat water rates in Birmingham were
more reasonable and that the aqueduct in
that city was recently constructed and at
less expense. The water company's ex
pert replied to the Mayor by informing
him that the pipes of the English water
company were over level territory, where
as the local corporation was compelled
to bring its water over 140 miles of hilly
country under great pressure. He said
that the great pressure had a tendency
to burst the pipes and that the soil
through which the pipe lino extended was
of such peculiar character that it ate into
the Iron and In less than ten years they
had to be replaced at a great expense.
Mayor Phelan interrupted Mr Schussler
to ask what would happen If there should
be a bad break in the pipeline between
here and San Andreas, and Mr. SchusÂ«ler
replied that there was no danger of the
city being cut off from Its water supply
as there are other lines. He further in
formed his interrupter that it is the cus
tom of his company to keep four days'
water supply in tho reservoirs sltuatod in
the outskirts of the city, and that the
company contemplated building another
reservoir that will hold ten clays' supply.
During the interesting discussion the
presence of Mr. Ames on the witness
stand was entirely forgotten. Mr. Kel
logg entered the fray and matched his
knowledge with the Mayor's, and the
board and spectators were treated to some
interesting repartee. The city's chief ex
ecutive did not escape from the fray un
scathed, as Mr. Kellogg in his replies told
some of the Mayor's past actions on water
rates. The Mayor opened the ball by re
marking to the water company's repre
sentative that during the winter months
the city's water supply for its parks had
been shut off. Mr. Kellogg replied that if
the same hand that directed his corpora
tion to turn off the supply would say the
word the water would be turned on before
sundown. The Mayor, of course, did not
give the necessary order. Mr. Kellogg
called attention to a bill of $25,000 that was
derived by the Spring Valley Water Com
pany from all sources for the year preced
ing January 1, 1900, and an itemized state
ment of all expenditures made for supply
ing: water during said time. He stated
that the total income was $1,903,411 S5. The
Mayor closely examined him about re
ceipts and disbursements and in the
course cf his statement he read that they
were as follows:
RECEIPTS.

vate consumers $1,546,939 02

The witness in explaining the foregoing
figures took occasion to show how the
company's Interests were affected by dry
seasons. He was interrupted in his an
swer by Mr. Schussler, who enlightened
the committee on the subject. He said
that in IS9S the company pumped seven
thousand five hundred and eighty-four
million gallons, fully twice as much as
the previous year, and that accounted en
tirely for the increase in the running ex
penses from one year to another. "If
we have a good rainfall," he said, "we
are able to reduce the running expenses
the rest of the season 20 to 25 per cent. If
this dry season continues we will have to
do fully as much pumping as we did last
season, and perhaps more."
Mr. Ames was asked by the Mayor why
he thought the taxes would be higher this
year and the witness replied that they
would be higher on account of the in
crease in rate.
"Has your directory agreed to lssiie
bonds?" asked the Mayor. Mr. Ames re
plied that when it was necessary to take
up the floating debt they would be issued.
That had always been the custom, but the
witness had paid no attention to It. Mr.
Ames stated that the present floating in
debtedness was something like $200 000.
There Is one indebtedness, he said, that
was permanent. It amounted to $273,000,
and it was secured by a mortgage on
which 2 per cent is paid. He said some
of the property mortgaged was located in
Merced. In answer to Mayor Phelan's
question as to whether there was any
other floating debt besides the one al
ready alluded to, Mr. Ames answered In
the affirmative. He said that there was
the present floating debt of $200,000 and the
mortgage. Mr. Ames informed his inter
rogator that he did not know the policy
of the company in mortgaging Its real es
tate, and as the Mayor continued his ques
tions along the same line Attorney Kel
logg interrupted him and made a <?hort
statement, in which he said that as he un
derstood it it was not in the ordinary
sense a mortgage, but was a contract of
purchase, which ran along In the shape
of a bond and had been running to his
knowledge nearly ten years. In reply to
Supervisor Brandenstein insisted that It
was the duty of the company to present
evidence of the value of the holdings
upon which it demands interest.
Schussler then declared that as an en
gineer understanding the value of the
works lor the specific purposes for which
they were created he would strive to
answer the question. He was never al
lowed to conclude, which may or may nqt
mean that a critical estimate of Spring
Valley holdings was not the essential is
sTje after all. Mr. Schussler declared that
the San Mateo holdings of the company,
considered as a unit and for the purposes
of supplying water by a system could not
be purchased for less than ten million
dollars.
of the company considered as a system,
could not be purchased for less than ten
million dollars.
At this interesting point, when it
seemed as if the whole secret was about
to receive public birth. Mr. Schussler was
asked to have the kindness to sit down.
The audience felt as If they had been
cheated out of a racy story. Then Mr.
Ames resumed his testimony and was
deep in interest accounts when again he
was interrupted. Attorney Kellogg seemed
burdened with a fund of information
which he wished to expend. He declared
that the company does not demand a 5
per cent interest on the value of Its prop
erty, which is more than thirty millions
of dollars, but on twenty-six millions of
dollars. He declared that it is unjust to
segregate the holdings of the company
and value them independently of their
uses: they must be appraised as a unit.
"But we have the right to say what
your property is worth," said the Mayor.
"We can say that the property is worth
only twenty millions and it will be only
of the value of twenty millions. We are
your only customers."
This astounding remark prompted a
quick reply. "You can place the value at
five million dollars," said Kellogg, "or
what you please, but we are here with the
expectation that you are to treat us with
Justice. That, as I understand it, is the
basis of our discussion."
The discussion then took a wide range,
but came to no particular result. One in
teresting point was developed, however,
when Attorney Kellogg showed that the
company loses about $25,000 a year In fur
nishing water for parks and schoolhouses.
JCO.OOO in Increased taxes and about $42,000
in bills which are never paid.
"You have a charity account there,"
said the Mayor sarcastically. "What does
that mean?"
"It means the money that we expend in
assisting old and disabled employes," was
the reply, and the Mayor subsided.
Hermann 6chusslÂ»r then volunteered
to jrlve the Information which Supervisor
Reed had requested earlier in the session.
The engineer insisted that from whatever
point we view the value of the Spring:
Valley pystem. and he discussed three,
the holdings are worth more than thirty
million dollars. When he had finished
Attorney Kellogg Invited the board to in
spect the various properties of the cor
poration, but the invitation -vas not ac
cepted. As a matter of incidental inter
est Supervisor Magulre contented him
self last night with a series of eloquent
flÃfhes of silence.
Mayor PhÂ«Â»lan called the board to order
nn hour later than the timo fixed for con
vening. He invited Supervisor Connor to
preside over the deliberations of the com
mittee of the whole and the city's chief
executive took the seat usually occupied
by the temporary chairman. Pelham W.
A*meÂ«. secretary of the Spring Valley "Wa
ter Company, then took the stand and
read a statement showing all the revenue
