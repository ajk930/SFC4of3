Hip Sing Tong* and the Suey Sirtjj
M^p Tongs are at it again, which means that the
W^ highbinder war is on. This is what the miners
would call the annual clean up. Just before the
end of the year this city is usually treated to a
Â«ensation in the way oLa brutal murder in Chinatown.
The daily papers tell us next morning that there has
been trouble between rival tongs, and that a man has
been murdered because he was a Sam Yup. which com
pany is not on good terms with the See Yup organiza
tion.
To begin with, there are two great Chinese
tongs which have their headquarters in this city;
they were started, or rather imported, by the first
Chinese who landed in this State in the early '50's, and
it is only fair to say that the original intention of the
founders of these societies were of a purely benevolent
nature, but like many organizations fostered by our
own countrymen the bad men have gradually gained
control and are now using them for their own corrupt
purposes.
When I say that the idea of the tong was brought
here by the Chinese pioneers I mean that they
were simply carrying with them the ancient form
of paternal eovernment. to which they have been ac
customed for many centuries. On account of the
peculiarities of the Chinese civil code, it is not
only an expensive but a very dangerous thing to go
to law over trifles, so the country people concluded
long ago that it was better to have all minor dispute?,
settled by arbitration, and such matters have ever since
been left to the wisdom of the elders of each village.
By the natural process of evolution, criminal as well as
civil cases were adjudicated by these same elders, and.
as this system relieved the central government of much
worry, no objection has ever been offered thereto.
When the first Chinese arrived on this coast they
found themselves associated with a strange people, of
whose language they had not tTie slightest knowledge,
and they soon realized that those of their countrymen
who were to follow would find themselves in the same
dilemma, and, as they were all from but two districts
of China, who were settled here at that time, the two
original societies were inaugurated, the Sam Yup and
the See Yup. and a great deal of good were these same
societies to the poor and ignorant who chanced to
come to this country. In the first place, all who were
without means were furnished board and lodging un
til places had been provided for them; they had the
advantage of a competent interpreter, a Portuguese,
who was born in Macao, a man thoroughly conversant
with the Chinese and English langtncres. For all these
favors they were charged nothing beyond the actual
cost. When any member wished to return to the old
country he was supposed to deposit the sum' of $n
as a donation to his society fund. This money was to
be used for the same purpose of relieving the others
of his race who might wish to try their fortunes in
the land of gold.
There was still another privilege accorded to the
members of these tongs. Confucius had written cen
turies ago that every Chinese must tie buried in Chinese
sqil. and it has ever since been one cf th.* worrying
fears of every son of the Flowery Kingdom that hv
some fluke his bones might be -left unclaimed in foreign
earth. Xo such fear if he were a member of one of
the tongs, for it was fairly stipulated that the ton^s
were to maintain an officer wiiose business it was to
see to it that every body be exhumed after a certain
period and the bones carefully shipped to his ances
tral home, and this agreement was carried out to the
letter.
As these societies grew in magnitude and impor
tance it was found necessary to send home for men of
more education to manage their affairs, for it must be
remembered that there was no such thing as a consulate
here for many years after the Chinese began to settle in
this country. So each district made it a rule that the
person passing the most creditable examination for the
government civil service, that is to say. the one next
highest to the one who had gained the home govern
ment prize, was to be made president of the local so
ciety in San Francisco, and for many years the position
was considered a great honor to the recipient.
Since the first Chinese landed in this country they
have made it their rule to settle all their small disputes
through the medium of the tong. These people, in
their ignorance, believe that they have a perfect legal
right to manage their own small affairs in this crude
oriental manner, and it is quite a surprise to many of
them when they find that some of their business trans
actions which have been approved by the tongs are not
as binding as they might be when tested in our courts.
But it must be adjnitted that the tongs had the virtue
of believing in themselves, and were as honest as they
were profoundly ignorant in the rendering of their de
cisions, and had they been wise enough to have kept
themselves within the province of civil actions, few
Americans would have objected to their method of dis
bursing miniature justice to their own countrymen. Uut
C.:ce they took it into their heads to try a hand at crim
inal practice there was trouble in store for the self-made
mandarin.
As the archives of this city will amply prove, the
real beginning of crime in the Chinese quarter began
with the importation of women to this country, that is
to say. those who were brought here for lewd purposes;
the great prices a^ked for these human chattels was
an incentive for robbery and murder, and. as a verifica
tion of the ...Id axiom. "There is a woman at the bot
tom of all trouble." the degeneration of the Chinese
benevolent societies may easily be traced to this source
and dated from the moment this horrible traffic in hu
man beings began.
\\ hen the first lot of women were brought here by
their purchasers it was tacitly admitted by all Chinese
then resident here that these poor creatures were the
legitimate property of their masters, but the ignorant of
the^e people are ever ready to adopt any innovation
that may seem to their personal advantage, even though
that new idea came from the much disliked "foreign
devil." It did not take long, through the kindness of
some of the real busybody "foreign devils," for the
evil-minded Chinese loafers to learn that in this coun
try there was no such thing as slavery, and thai if a per
son could persuade these frail women to desert their
masters they were free to do so. Of course they were
promised protection by these fellows, and were led to
believe that as soon as they quitted their masters they
were to become the wives of respectable men who had
taken this great interest in their welfare. It is unneces
sary to say that these were all empty promises made Â»o
the unfortunate women in order to gain possession of
them and hold them for ransom.
When the slave owners found thru their bagnios
were being looted in this manner they at once rushed
to their local tribunal crying aloud for justice, and in a
moment of weakness the heads of the tongs gave heed
to their complaints, and even tried to induce the rob
bers to return the women to their former masters. But
these brigands had inherited the blood of their an
cestors, the old river pirr.tes of China, and it was not
in their nature to give u,i anything of value once they
had gained the nine points of possession. Disagree
ments soon followed: members took varior vie.vs of
the situation, and some of the really well inclined tooi<
sides with the wicked, innvjcently believifig that the
robbers were working in the cause of justice and that
they really intended liberating the poor slave women.
Thus ended the usefulness of the original tongs, dis-

to bcamper back to our room, I assure
you. We had been so thoroughly fright

leave the candy behind and be where we
could with case talk over our narrow
escape. "
While at Mills Emma appeared ot the
closing conc.Tt of each term and tho^o
who heard her then foretold a brilliant
future for the young girl, who now two
States claim for a daughter; ami to whom
royalty has bowed. Schoolmates tell of
Emma's singing, of hor favorite song,
"Listen to the Nightingale," and how
after dinner they would sit and listen, en
raptured while she s;tr.g fur them her
limited repertoire, which now has grown
to dozens of operas.
With the class of "TG Emma Wixom left
"Mills," and, as she said, the only mother
she had ever known, it wns through this
mother, Mrs. Mills, that Emma went to
Paris. Dr. Wixom had been unfortunate
financially and was unable to give his
daughter the musical education she
craved. Dr. Ebell. the naturalist, be
came interested through Mrs. Mills, and
when he and Mrs. Ebell left for Paris
Emma Wixom sailed with them. Dr.
Ebell's sudden death and Mrs. Ebell's re
turn to America left Emma alone in
Paris with more ambition than money.
It was a modest beginning and hard. One
little Western girl alone in Paris, almost
without friends; lonely, yet too ambitloU3
to give up; homesick, yet determined to
stay and get the education she had all
her life longed for.
It was then that Mrs. John W. Mackay
heard her sing and made it possible for
Emma Wixom to study under one of the
best teachers of the dayâ Marchesi. Three
years of hard work and then her heart's
desire â opera.

into the room. We waited, expecting
every moment to have her brought back
under the watchful eye of a teacher.
"When we were sure that Lillian w-is

water and watch her opportunity, and
then slipped downstairs.
"It was then my turn, nnd I was not

"Consternation and what shall we do

with a box of randy in one hand and a

empty olive bottles, jumped into a ward

My Dearest Mrs. Mills:
Many years ago w!\en I was your little
"chick," as you useil to call me. It was
always my dream to sing before the
Queen of England; and I remember the
happy school days at Mills' when I made
my little plans-.-ail to myself, and one of
my Hpeclal projects wasâ one day I should
sing ut the court of St. James. Last night
the. dream was realized. I received a
command from her Majesty, who had
never heard me. to go to her â to Osborne,
where sho resides during all tbfe month
cf August. Wo have been her guests since
the d;iy before yesterday and last night
I had tho honor and delight of singing for
her.
I could not restrain my tears as I stood
before the great queen and noble womanâ
to pee the dear sovereign of SO years
fo Interested In music, so kind, and
gracious. When I had finished my sec
ond song she called me again and
said "It i 3 beautiful. Wonderful." I tell
you her exact expressions because I know
it will Interest you. Her Majesty and the
King of Sweden wore the only crowned
heads in Europe that were left, for me.
I had sung for them all.
Her Majesty askod me If I was not an
American and I proudly answered, "From
California," and almost said from Mills
Seminary. Beforo leaving her Majesty's
presence I was introduced to her Royal
Highness the Princess Beatrice (I knew
all the others) and some of the ladies in
waiting.
Last week I sang, and so did Mignon,
for the Princess Christian and Victoria,
and of course Mignon delighted us all. She
is certainly to-day the most marvelous
singer In the world and is only twelve. I
wrote in the Queen's birthday book and
then she presented me with a decoration
which consists of _ her monogram set in
diamonds, pearls and turquoises sur
mounted by a crown in red enamel, gold
and diamonds.
It was itfter eleven when we took leave
of her Majesty. I say we because my
husband vf course was with meâ lt was
too late at night for Mignon. We were

Here they were made un- \\,\/ y
comfortable and filled with a s Â¦ Njvjr
dread of something that they 'S
could not understand. The flashes
from our heliograph signalers were
almost always in view, as messages
were being sent back and forth over
the peaks. This was something
that they could not understand and
was attributed by them to spirit agency.
They would never attempt to scale any
of the peaks from which they had seen
these flashes and their territory became
more and more limited. The men would
never work. Their hands showed that
such had been their habit for generations,
for the wrists were actually larger than
the hand, as we found afterward when
v/e tried to handcuff them.
The women, overcome and exhausted by
the superhuman tasks of attempting to
provide fuel and water for the. camps of
the mouiitain peaks, were unable to nurse
or feed their starving 1 children and rather
than leave them to be eaten by coyotes
or panthers threw them to their death In
the gloomy canyons.

The final surrender of Geronlmo took
place in what was known as Skeleton
Canyon, a deep gorge eleven miles from
the Mexican boundary.
It took its name from a massacre which
occurred there long before, when the
guards and mules of a pack train loaded
with Mexican; dollars were, killed by
bandits. In the mix-up many of the raw
hide sacks of dollars were burst open and
scattered about, and even to the present
time it is still possible to find those
melancholy souvenirs scattered here and
there about the desolate rocks.
At last the time came, when Geronlmo. â¢
sent a squaw into camp to say that he
wanted to. see Lawton, Who was then
rounding up the last of the scattered out
siders, lieutenant Gatewood took a few
men and went to see Geronimo, but re
turned discouraged and said that he
thought that the Indians were only at-:
tempting to gain time and that any com
munication was dangerous: It was Im
possible from their location and from the
wornout "condition" of our troops' to 'at
tempt to kill or capture them by force.
Lawton said that Geronimo had not
made his offer in bad faith and went out
the next morning to meet him. * He suc

These Apaches Â¦ felt* .themselves but
women before their captors. Lawton him
self,was gaunt, ragged and lean, having
lost forty pounds in weight, but his face
was sparkling- v.-ith joy at the successful
end of as hard a fight as ever Hannibal
saw. Not -killed by sudden advantage,

In a fair test of endurance. The chase
had- covered over a thousand miles of
travel and had been a life and death
struggle for every man in It, the hunters
as well as the game;
-The early part of the day was spe.it in
gathering in the Indians, telling them
what was expected of them and preparing
for an early start next day. As the.after

the canyon,- and then came a â¢tempest
with continuous explosions of, electricity
with which the air was charged and a
smashing rain that drove us allâ officers,
soldiers, scouts and prisonersâ into the*
covered wagons for shelter.
'A wild, dramatic ending to the play,
with murderers â¢in the skeleton-covered
canyon, that was itself a stage where
murders had been. This was the fourth
surrender of Geronimo and the last.
There were a few straggling Indiana
that could not be found or induced to

enemy broken. ' . .- ? : . j.-V ..â¢Â¦ ..' â¢ â¢

Apache* with him. In the force cent

iss thaun fifty eoldiers and something
more than twice that number of Chirica
bua Indian scouts. The Apaches had left
the reservation well supplied with arms
and ammunition, and had put in tru-ir
tlrr.e driving stock across the line until
that rart of the Sierra Madre where they
were lcdK<<i was a regular stock ranse,
with plenty of ponies to ride and cattle
for food.
The Indians were well fixed for a long
f:pht. They had no fear of the Mexicans,
either civilians or soldiers. They were
ssfe from attack from the Americans by
reason of being out of cur territory. They
had transportation and food wherever
they might be, for the cattle and ponies
wandered at will over a large range, and
the Indians knew the sheltered and crrassy
valleys where they could be found.
The policy was not to attack them In
any one pitched battle, but to take them
as a hunter and his dog would hunt quail.
They were rapidly driven ahead of us.-

out to repel invading bands of X
Apaches they seldom escaped with
out painful experiences.
The Apaches were careful to save
ammunition whenever possible and one of
their economies was to lie in wait at the
head of a barranca, or on the walls of ona
of the many cienegas through which the
Mexicans must pass. When the sooutless
Mexicans came walking, beneath the trjp
the Indians would industriously tumble
rock 3 over upon them, sometimes killing
and wounding soldiers, stampeding their
pack trains and demoralizing them com
pletely.
We started out with a well equipped
pack train, but as we got farther up Into
the high Sierra we gradually lost or were
compelled to leave our pack animals.
Many of them fell over the edges of the
trail and were killed by the fall, others
were ?o injured that they had to be shot.
As we entered this rough country we
found that the Indians also were losing
ponies and many of them were still allvo
but exhausted and "lying. Some had been
killed and partly cut up and eaten, for
an Indian, especially an Apache, is always
fond of horse meat and they seem to eat
it indifferently, even when they could ob
tain beef. They always carried a supply
of it cut into long strings bo that it
might dry as they travelled. As our
chase became more serious the enemy
took to still higher land. We discarded
all of our packing outfit and each man.

framed a charter by which the city of

officers which it called for, were voted
upon en the iirst day of September.
Needless to say, there was much button

parties, for the iCTue was of no email im

quickly. Lanky JoÂ«Â» and Old Horse Ken
got their heads together and decided on
a plan of action. *
Abcut a mile below Nome, working the
sands en the beach, were some 500 men.
These men had no particular interest in
the welfare of the city, and so did not
atter.d the election. It wa? to these men
that tfce labor party appealed, telling
them of the untold quantities of bottled
enthusiasm which awaited them if they
would avail themselves cf their oppor

manifest their equal rights. Thus passed
the first election day In Nome, quiet ar.d
peaceful. True. Â«everal of thÂ«> more tur
buUnt were inflicted with Fma!l wemndi.
No one* was shot to death: they might
have died the next day. but. of courte,
that did not count.
Each citizen felt proud within himself.
Inasmuch as he had demonstrated the
first principle of American rightsâ that
every man had a right to vote, and the
mere often he voted the better citizen he
was. Nome, now that rhe had adopted a
charter, awakened from her lethargy,
threw off the remains of her mushroom

The Judge thereupon declared T^_
"all bets off," and consigned the >
prisoners back to jail to await his %
coming the following year. V
There is also told a story of a notor
ious character by the name of Clear Kid,
who committed many depredations and
was finally arrested for robbing a
drunken sailor. The city Justice fixed
his bail at $1000. The dust was promptly
forthcoming and tne culprit was allowed
his temporary freedom. The bail money
was deposited In the city treasuryâ thÂ«
pocket of the Chief of Police. This dig
nitary, by some mishap, lost the envelope
containing the bail dust. All Nome stood
aghast. The honor of the Chief was a 1
etake. A man by the name of Moses
Roiencrariti chared to find the precious
envelope, and he. good man, at once re
turned it to the authorities. For this
act of eelf-denial Moses was dubbec
"Honest Mose," and "Honest Moee" h<
is to this day. The only reward he askec
was that one of the three hair mattressej
then in Nome be given him. Needless tc
cay, he got it.
This mattress, although it was a grea'
comfort, was at the same time a greai
source of trouble. It was coveted bj
for a drink and $2 SO fcr a hair cut. Pis
tols were given an extra clearing and the
price of cartridges advanced 50 per cent.
Tfce rar.fllda.tes, Jn the meantime, let their
pistol flngers EtiJTen from lack of exer

en the- day cf election was a bitter one.
Jt commenced early in the morning and
lasted far Into the night. All day long
men hurried about voting here and there.
There were three voting booths and any
citizen could rote in all three at least
enc* an hour, the interim being filled In
ty gambling and drinking. No special
form cf ticket was used. Pencil, paper
and the smooth tide of the dance hall
furnished the essentials. Such a thing
is a register was unheard of. John

and a police force were established; a
City Attorney saw that r.o person of evil
intent menaced the public finances,
which, by the way, were carried about
in the pocket of the Chief of Policeâ a
mar. chosen on account of his nerve under
Cre and his unfaltering aim.
ilany amusing incidents are given by
Mr. Jaffe which have to do with the ad
ministration of justice in this far-off
land. One is told of Circuit Judge H. D.
Johnson, who came to Nome City but
once a year, the circuit being so large
and the season so short. The Grand Jury,
therefore, convened but once a year and
all trials were stayed pending the arrival
of the Judge. Court was In full swing
and several prisoners were up for trial
on serious charges. Suddenly the door

a hair mattress was worth risking some
thing for, and consequently Honest Mose
had no little difficulty in keeping the
supine forms of his fellow townsmen from
reposing upon that which did not belong
to them.
A piano and a mattress do not go well
together either in poetry or in prose save
when they are taken from a folding-bed
point of view, but there was an indirect
connection between the first piano in
Nome and the mattress belonging to Hon
est Mose. The arrival of this piano was
an event of much Importance and at the
same time of great satisfaction to all
parties concernedâ thÂ« public, the owner
and the piano itselfâ because Nome pre

Like all other parts of this world. Nome
!s not without its pathetic s!de. Men and
women live. die and suffer there as well
as In any other place, and perhaps In a
more marked degree. The class of people
who so to mining camps are these who
are rough and ready and withal have the
human side of their natures well devel
oped, unhampered by the conventions of
refined society, which teach that senti
ment should be lost early in youth ar.d
that a placid, stele existence is to be
adopted instead.
A baby was born in Nome, the Srst that
was torn thereâ torn in the midst of all
the roughness ana Hardship round there,
and ur.dcr conditions at which many a
strong man l:as ninched. The father died
soon after the child was born and left the
mother dependent upon the community.
The nunerss â tig. stiong, burly fellows â
vied with one another in representing the
community. They all worshiped at the
shrine of Billy, for that was his came,
and feit well rewarded if they got a peep
at the little round face or the tiny pirJc
hands. Billy could iiave had Lis weight
in oust should he have wanted it, or any
thing else, for that matter. Already he
had Jim Moak's watch to make eyes at,
and Finicky Dick had left a nice, round
r.ugget for "the kiii" to cut his teeth
upon when the tfme came. But the time
never came. Uiliy pasted away one day
-at the breast cf his mother. Honest Mose
said that Billy was too good fcr the place,
and that was all there was to it. They
burled the little follow out back of the
k town. The snows of winter come
ttk down and cover up the place, and
in the spring the sun comes and
the mantle melts away, leav

graveâ green as the memory

tale cf many wrecks and wasted capita!.
This driftwood until recently was used
for fuel, but now. owing to Improved
transportation facilities, coal has been in
troduced. The city itself is a collection
of bamllke structures and tents, indis
criminately scattered about. V.'ooden
houses are at a premium, as lumber of
the roughest kind costs $300 rer thousand
feet. Saloons and dance balls ficur.jb.
and gambling is conducted with that open
r.ess so distinctive of any new town.
Wages are good, bat the cost of living iÂ»
proportionately large. The commonest
form of labor ccrnrnanis a salary of $15 to
120 a day. Men owning claims make rn.ro
SICO to %iYA a week. The banner clean- up
is claimed by a miner by the name of
Cummlngs, who in one day cleaned up L-7
ounces of gold, valued at SIS 23 an ounce.
The beach for many miles is dotted w:tn
mining claims. The particular sand la
which the gold is found is ruby red in
color and lies a few feet below the s-.ir
face. in strata from two to nine inches in
thickness.
Two rivers, the Snake and the Nome,
drain the Nome district. These and tiieir
tributaries give the appearance upon a
map not unlike the backbone of a Ais. The
richest of these creeks are Anvil, Snow
Gulch, Dexter, Basin and Buster.
The harbor at Nome is almost Inacc -s
sible, and ships of any draught can Â«>Â¦
preach scarcely within two miles of the
shore on account of the shallowcess cf the
water. Landings are made in small boats,
and even then at the risk of a good wet
ting. The targes are cast adrift some
mile 3 from land and then washed up on
the shore. This method does not always
prove successful, as many barges have
teen wrecked and much valuable freight
has been lost. But the city, in spite of
Its remotenes and Its hampered trans
portation facilities, is progressing. Enter
prise has shown itself. An electric light
and power plant Is soon to be established,
and this, together with other improve
ments, will do much to offset the incon
veniences of this treasure laden city.
These new gold fields at Nome nave all
the advantages necessary to a prosperous
mining district. They have, primarily,
the essentials of easy mining. The titlis
are large and easily accessible daring four
months cf the year. The claims, tech
nically speaking, are shallowâ that Is to
say. the pay dirt Is not far below the sur
face and is of easy working. There is an
unlimited quantity of water and the drain-

considering the isolation of -the place and
the cost of transportation. Quicksilver,
however, must be part of the miner's out
fit when he starts for the gold fields, and
it is imperative that 50 or 103 pounds be
taken along, as this commodity sells at a
high price, and very little of It is handled
by the Nome merchants.
The rocker is the most complex of
the Implements used and yet it is
quite fcltnple, and consists chiefly of
a long box or trough 6ume four

about two feet in width, gradually taper

silver Is poured. Directly over the -large!
end of the trough and fastened to it is
set a wooden box, two or three feet
square and open at the top. The bottom
Is of tin, tnost likely a coal oil can per

kind that rocked us to and fro in our
babyhood. The mixed sand and gravel
are shoveled into the box and then water
is poured over. The rocker is set in mo
tion and the sand is washed through the
trough and over the copper plates. The
water and free sand pass out through the
Fmall end of the rockc*. leaving the gold
amalgamated with the quicksilver. Truly

world.

MYSTERIES
OF THE
SEA.
The mysteries of the deep seaa are com
ing to light. Scientists have measured
the mountains of the ocean bed and their
lead lines have penetrated into valleys so
deep that the sun's rays are lost miles
above their bottom.
Some of these are more than 30,000 feet
below the surface. If the highest moun
tain in the world were set at the bottom
its summit would be nearly half a mile
under water. A rope long enough to sound
their remote depths would reach from the
Mississippi River into St. Louis County.
In the*e valleys thcro are no plants,
â¢woods or Vegetation of any kind, because
such forms of life need light, and at
these depths there is total darkness. But
animal life flourishes. Many of these
deep-sea animals are gigantic. These ani
mals are all, or nearly all, without eyes.
Most of them eat mud and slime, but
there are others that seek living prey,
find it by means of great feelers and then
grasp and kill it with lonÂ«j tentacles.
It is strange that in these dark and
freezing abysses vast quantities of vege
table matter arc found that during their
lives were bathed in tropica.l sunlight and
in water SO decrees above zero. These de-
posits lie side by side with other orÃan-
four stakes, one for each corner of the
rectangle. As soon as a piece of land
is decided upon by the prospective miner
the district recorder Is notified, who. for
the small sum of $2 50. examine* the rec
ords to find out if there are Â«my previous
claimants, and, if none are found, places
the location on record. Locating a claim
in the York district is the same in process
but different as to sfze. inasmuch as the
land geologically is different from that
of the other districts. The area 'allowed
here is 500 feet In width, and the length
depends on the geographical formation.
The width may vary from a hundred feet
to half a mile. The creek on the borders
of which the claim is taken up generally
passes through the claim. What is known
technically as the rim, or rims, forms the
boundaries on either end of the claim.
The rim is nothing else but that place in
the formation of the land where the hills
â¢forming the water-shed begin to rise. It
is estimated by the transportation com
panies that there will be a heglra of gold
jseekers, numbering some 23,000, to these
\new gold fields next spring.
Isms which passed all their lives in dark
ness, and at a temperature near to the
freezing point. The vegetable organisms
were originally absorbed by plants and
animals on the earth's surface or In the
shallow waters, and it is estimated that
three-fourth 3 of the deposits now covering
the bottom of the ocean have at some
time passed through the alimentary ca
nals of marina animals.
The geography of the seaâ"ocean
ography" It Is called, began with the lay
ing of the ocean cables and was elevated
into a branch of science by the cruise of
the Challenger. Since then it has been
found that there are forty-three great
deep-sea valleys. The Pacific Ocean. Uka
the Pacific slope, is the great mountainous
region of the water world: there are
twenty-four vast valleys concealed be
neath It.
According to a paper read by Sir John
Murray before the British Association the
area occupied by these deeps is estimated
at 7,132,000 geographical square miles, or
about 7 per cent of the water surface of
the globe. Within them over 230 soundings
have been recorded, of which twenty-

Has Put Her Foot on the Rung of the
Ladder, Determined to Climb
to the Top.
I have been requested to express an opinion nn the twen
tieth century woman. I consider the woman of the nineteenth
century one of the most brilliant as well as one of the noblest
products of the dying century. From unrecorded time as
well as from the dawn of civilization, every age has brought
forth new developments. The nineteenth century- is noted for
Its discoveries and inventions directed to utilitarian and prac
tical ends, in all of which woman has played an important
part. Her Impress and moral influence are engraved on every
step of the world's progress. The woman of to-day doe 3 with
the approval of the world what would have been condemned
In the time of St. Paul.
In ancient and medieval times there have been women with
all shade.s of opinions. There has come to the surface the polit
ical Deborah, the cruel but courageous Jael. the masculine and
heroic Judith, the self-sacrificing Jephthah's daughter, the ac
complished and Intellectual Cleopatra, the valorous Zenobia.
the wise Hypatias and the brilliant Aspasias, but the present
century runs the same gamut of illustrious women. Ths
masses of to-day have risen, become a power and are recog
nized at their true worth.
Woman no longer sits down and waits for the recog
nition of man. but she rises in the dignity of her true
womanhood and makes for herself a niche in the world,
whether in the temple of fame or in acting well her part
In the humblest condition cf life, and that is what makes
the nineteenth century woman the equal of the nineteenth
century man.
Woman in all ages has been the firm friend and com
forter of man. assuaging his grief and alleviating nil
pain. To-day she is by his side endeavoring to lighten hH
task as a breadwinner as well as being "a ministering
angel." And she Is more than ever anxious to better the
conditions of humanity and ready to go along with the resist
less tide of the electrical nineteenth centuryâ the century that
In gravitating toward the revolutionizing of the world with
Its rapid strides, bringing up new problems without solving thÂ»
old ones. No difference what will occur, woman will keep right
on as she Is now, smiling, alert and active. From the glrMa
the woman, from the woman of limited means to ore of fabu
lous wealth, from the religious to the materialistic woman,
from the woman of the home to the woman of the world!
comes the eager desire to do something besides basking In the
sunshins for her own gratification, like "the lilies of the field
that spin not, neither do they toll." She is no longer thÂ» igno
rant, soulless thing of former times, but she has put her foot
on the rung of the ladder, determined to climb to the top.
Woman, though weak physically, is strong mentally, patient
in suffering and warm tn sympathy. Paradoxical as it may
seem, woman is stronger and braver than
man. The woman of the nineteenth cen
tury Is comparatively more splendid in at
i^ tftlnments, more liberal in thought, taora
active in educational and altruistic pro
'^^^. pensities than the woman of past ages.

Advance of Woman Marks
the Advance of the
Age.
The woman of the twentieth century
will be the outgrowth of the formative In
fluences of this nineteenth century.
Of these the most prominent Is ths
higher education now given to women.
Education la of undoubted good to the
race, anil applied specifically to women It
has a direct effect through the medium of
the family.
Its influence Is to dispel ignorance and
superstition and thus bring better condi
tions into the family life; to develop the
power of Judgment and to offer it as a
balance to the old criterion of feeling or emotion, which, how
ever. It does not destroy.
Therefore. I have no sympathy with those who fear wo
men will lose their essential characteristics as women and
their love for domestic life. If there is any such tendency now.
It is but a phase of a transitional stage and must disappear
before a still higher development.
The advance of woman is simply a mark of the advar.es
of the age. Compare the liberal education thought necessary
for women in the early part of the last century with that of
to-day. A valued book of those times prescribes for her "Read-
Ing with propriety and life; readiness at her necd!e. a free
command of lter pen and complete knowledge of numbers as
far as the rule called practice."
The conditions of the next century may require of woman
as great an advance from the conditions of to-day as she haa
made from her status in the last century.
Club life, college settlements and organized charities are
Indications of her capacity for organization; teach her to sub
ordinate the Individual for the sake of the general good and.
develop heY knowledge of human nature. This phase of her

giving the verdict then and there. There
were no lawyers to plead and there was
no . appeal.
The "grandea famillas" of Castilian
origin who occupied the valley of Santa
Clara had adequate if original ways of do
ing things. If two men had a dispute In
relation to anything and could not agree,
they went before the Judge and each man
told his story. The Judge did the ques
tioning and then formed' his conclusion,
Another example of peculiar adminis
tration of laws Is the case of a woman
who slandered another. The culprit was
called before the Judge and sentenced to
be publicly reprimanded for being a scan
dal-monger.
The first Americans to discover this lit
tle Arcadia were the officers of tbe tra4-
the toreador, permission to hare a ball
fight. The horse races were run In the
streets or In an open field, and gambling
was indulged in everywhere. The decorum
was good at the fimdangos at first, and
everybody went. It was not till much
later, when the rough element got the
upper hand, that fandangos were hilari
ous beyond the bounds of propriety.
The legislators were paid in State war
rants, which could not be cashed until
after the first taxes were collected. But
there was not enough money to cash all
of them, and more than half were never
redeemed. There was a great deal of
favoritism shown, some getting only a
very small fraction of the face value. The
currency was principally "slugs"âfifty
dollar gold pieces. Dimes and nickels
were unknown.
Living was a luxury not to be In
dulged by everybody that rainy winter.
A good many temporarily existed. The
shining lights all- stopped at the Mansion
House; the lesser lights stayed in divers
and sundry places. There were some im
promptu lodging housea, with tiers of
bunks along the walls and layers of beds
Ing vessels, which used to come to A!vfao
bringing beautiful articles of wearing ap
parel to exchange for hides and. tallow.
These traders were all courteous gentle
men and the Callfornians accepted them
as types of their countrymen. It was
because of this friendship for "LoÂ« Ameri
canos" whom they did know and like so
sincerely that the native Callfornian re
ceived the gold hunters with open arms.
It was plainly the desire of the first
Legislature to make laws which would
protect the original owners of the land.
They began by abolishing all laws then In
force in the State, and that that did not
succeed in starting a perfect govern
mental machine in a few short weeks and
establishing order out of hopeless chaos
with an empty treasury Is not to be won
dered at. The wonder is that they suc
ceeded even so well.
The first Senate and Assembly did not
pass a single special law for the benefit
of an individual or class, and no measure
was carried by corrupt or sinister Influ
ences.
A number of them slept in the capacious
garret ot "Uaole" Isaao Brscham's rrsl-
dence, and upon going to bed they used
to amuse themselves by putting out the
candles with pistol shots. At the fan
dangos the men kept their hats on and
treated their partners after each dance.
Eefore the arrival of the unsocialistlo
Gringos, when the Mexican caballero
wanted to take a pasear he caught one of
the horses from the herds which grazed
on the commons, saddled him and rode as
much as he liked with never a thought as
to the ownership of the caballo. And
these native cavaliers could never be>
brought to understand that such a pro
ceeding was the heinous crime of horse
stealing.
Ever so many Mexicans were hanged at
Ban Jose for horse stealing, and the Call
fornlans made a solemn vow, after the
fashion of the Sicilian vendetta, that for
every Californian thus murdered they
would have the lives of three Americans,
and they usually kept the vow.
The favorite manner of vengeance was
to throw a lasso over the head of the vic
tim, ride away over the plain and drag
him to death.
John W. Redmon. Judge at the time,
sbout whom there was a tradition that
there had been a time when he was sober,
was one day passing sentence upon a
horse thief. "On Friday, the 10th. at X
o'clock, you shall be hanged by the neck
till you are dead. dead, dead." Then turn-
Ing to the prisoner he said. "Sabe that.
Dlos te condenar?"
This Interesting old eccentric's fatrorttÂ«
expression while on the bench was: "TnÂ«
court rules so and so. I don't know what
my right and left bowers think."
Every house was an inn during the
meeting of the first Legislature, where all
comers were welcomed and feasted.
"Grandma Bascom's" story of the way
she "entertained thirteen boarders that
winter gives a fair Idea of the chaotic con
dition of things.
It was Impossible for her to secure the
services of a cook, and most of the num
ber imposed themselves upon her hospital
ity with promises to : help In all sorts of
ways. Dignified Senators carried water
from the well and helped to cook and
wash dishes. She said they appeared as
much like gentlemen when they were
cooking In her kitchen as when they were
making speeches in the Legislature.
One of them made such capital batter
cakes that the Bascom home soon became
known as "Slapjack Hall.V
Not an evening passed without a larga
party as some home., but the big ball
which was given at the close of the ses
sion was the social event of that decade.

building worth three hundred thousand
dollars and to donate to the State all the
necessary land besides, a bill was passed
to move the capital to Benicla in order to
accept this offer. But adverse circum
stances Interfered and the general was
unable to put a foundation under his cas
tle in the air. The legislators were so
disgusted with the large barnlike building
which he did construct that they voted to
move to the town of Vallejo. Here they
stayed during the whole of the second
session and before they adjourned they
resolved to go to Sacramento. And thus
ended the career of "California's capital
on wheels."
An amusing story which illustrates the
fact that straws rule most lives is told
of the inaugural ball. All the prominent
Californian families were Invited. The
duns put the bits of notepaper disdainfully
aside and had not the slightest Intention
of accepting, but the young ladles were
consumed with the desire to dance with
the young Americans, and they begged so
persistently that their mammas finally
consented to chaperone them. That made
It absolutely necessary for the papas to
go. as wives in Mexico never go anywhere
unattended. Naturally the sweethearts of
the girls wls..ed to go, and so It ended in
the native four hundred attending en
masse. Of course the courtesy muet be
returned, and thus it naturally came
about that distinctions of race were never
made in California society.
The Spanish senoritas were very grace*
ful dancers ar.d they soon learned the
American dances then in vogue. The
American gentlemen always sent car
riagf? to fetch them to the dances.
Governor Burnett's daughters and
Jairif" Reed's daughters, although mere
children, were the belles of the social
functions of that historic winter.
"We just had to go. In those days
womm were qut-pns and children angels,"
paid Governor Burnett's oldest daughter,
Mrs. C. T. Ryland. In reminiecenslng nf
thos<Â» old days. "But we had better so
clety then in San Jose than is found in
Sacramento to-day during a session of
the Legislature. The first men who came
here were strong, vigorous and young,
and the atmosphere was healthy."
But In the annals of the initial Legisla
ture of California few social functions are
recorded. Amusement then was suffi
cientâ gambling, horse-racing, bull fights
and fandangoes. But those were the dear
dead days before the advent of pro
fessionalism. Of excitement there was
no lack.

was moved from Pan Jos<\ and the men

In '43 the majority of the people in Cail
fornla were of Spanish origin and could
rot speak English, so one of the first du
tles of the Legislature was to pass an act
creating the office cf State translator.
Joseph H. Scuil was elected to the por
tion, with a salary of SS&OO a year. He
translated Into Spanish the acts passed by
the Legislature for the information of the
native Calif orr.ians. All legal document*.

Governors, etc., were in Spanish, and

clouily accommodated her furry limbs
-with a happy croon and patronizing wink'

"Come, coins, you bÂ« tired out, Annie,
the blank on the wall, recalllm? Jim's de
linquency, family pride abased, Annie's
savings gone and prospects marred, and
the hard struggle to get the money. A
few days since she had been proud or
Jim; now she had scarce heart to be glad
of his averted disgrace.
She was accustomed to go out to work
where extra hands were needed; shÂ» too*
home sewing and made and sold mead,
ketchup and such things, thus taking ths
â¬-dge from solitude and making tho quiet
â¢if her hearth welcome. But now In thÂ»
shuttered cottage by night with winter
storm tilling the woods with eldritch
shrieks and weird walllngs, and rain
drawing a chill curtain over all. tho se
questered cottage was more solitary than
solitude; a vast stretch of irapenetrab!Â»
ni=;ht spread between her and humanity.
The very slowness of the steady tick-tack
had been comforting and companionable,
from marking time's lapse, it became an
assurance of eternity. Without haste,
without rest, day sir.d nicjht. summer and
winter, in fair weather and foul, the>
clock's tick was pregnant with memories
of her whole life, its labor and rest, Joy
and sorrow.
Neighbors' children had scarcely left off
running in to ask what of the clock to
set their mothers' timepieces by when
Mrs. Hurt gave up. seeming to caro for
nothing, yet complaining of no pain. Jim.
penitent and conscience-struck, drove
over with his wife, but the couple could
â¢scarcely get a word from her save that
she was lonesome and worn out. He
brought her a cheap timepiece, with a
quick, loud tick that fretted her nerves
and never kept time. Toward New Year.
Annie found her mother in bed. the
doctor was fetched, and neighbors coming
in to help told one another Ellen Burt
would scarce see the snowdrops. So Jo
seph Woodnutt thought on New Year's
eve, when he looked in at dusk and found
Annie crying. When ho came out hÂ»
strode straight across the road under the
leafless trees of Nutcombe place In the
roaring wind, and boldly demanded audi
ence of her ladyship, to the indignation of
the man who answered his ring at the
principal entrance. Firelight blazed
through the hall windows and upon armor
and boar-spears and full-length por
traits; silvery laughter rang out: he
could see the young mother and children
playing at ball under the hollies and mis
tletoes.
"Who is this must see her ladyship?"
the tall young countess asked, stepping
toward the door. "Woodnutt? And what
is her ladyship to do now, pray? A
woman's sake, a?ain?"
He stepped into the full blaze and
stood before the stately young beauty,
now seated in a carved oaken chair, her
children grouped around her. "Yes, your
ladyship," he replied, "and the ooman's
dying now."
"If you please." ho continued, when her
rejoinder had assured him of sympathy,
"you bought Mrs. Burt's clock: I want to
buy en back again. That's all."
"Oh!" Sympathy left her face. "But
I have no clocks to sell."
"Begging your pardon," he returned,
"your ladyship have got a clock been In
Mrs. Burt'a family over a hundred year.
Mrs. Hurt's a-dying for want of that
clock. And 1 can give 'cc twenty pound
down, and the other fifteen In a fort
night."
"Lord Sharland has spoken well of you.
Woodnutt. You presume upon his good
opinion. Mrs. Burt sold me a clock some
time since for a high price. She was eager
to sell it. It ls a good clock. I have no
intention of parting with it." She ros*
with cold displeasure. "Come. Gwenny."
she said, reaching a hand to her daughter
"But she'll die." cried Joseph.- following
her; "Mrs. Burt'll die. your ladyship."
She turned and paused. "Poor woman*
I am sorry. What can I do for her?"
"Sell me that there clock. If she could
hear en tick-tacken again same as all her
life, she mcd perk up again. She can't
bide without en. She's entirely nlned
away for en." -
"Absurd! Why then did she sell her
clock? I cannot give people clocks be
cause somebody happens to be dying "
"Do 'cc bide and hearken, ma'amâ your
ladyship," he Implored, barring her way
and turning the blaze of his earnest eyes
upon her. so that she stepped back a few
paces and leaned against the tall chimney
piece. "Mrs. Burt's Annie's mother."
* * An! , Who ls Annieâ what has Annie
to do with the stars, pray?"
"Annie gave me her promise, your lady
ship." he replied with gravity: "then cama
family trouble I swore on the Bible not
to tell. Annie and her mother they raised
money wanted between 'em. But my girl
ls too proud to come to me empty handed,
and she seen her mother pined for th 4
clock and she said she'd work her fingers
to the bone .but she'd buy en back. So
I thinks to myself, I'll work that clock
back, and I'll work Annies saving 3 back.
So I up and I go to you. a young ooman
with a husband and children and a tender
heartâ"
"And said it was for a woman's sake."
she interposed, her eyes suffused with
sympathy. "I was not aware that I was
plotting against my poor clock that dayâ
everybody seems to want my darling
clock. The clock Is yours, Woodnutt.
And my best wishes are yours. I must seÂ»
your Annie; she shall have a weddlne
present; I must give her a wedding: gown
She is to be congratulated. She will have
a manly true-hearted husband."
By this time Joseph was one solid blush*
his head went round, his mouth opened'
he found himself standing alone, listen
ing bewildered to the departing steps of
mother and children. Rells pealed mer
rily from the tower upon the roaring wind
as he hastened back to the cottage to tell
Annie that the clock was redeemed and
everybody was to be happy ever after
They were striving to convey these tidlmra
to Mrs. Burt an hour later, when thÂ«
sound of voices and footsteps below called
attention to men wheeling a truck, upon
which something lay on a mattress cov
ered with a cloth.
"Mother," *aid Joseph, "Wold clock's

I ; a \f l i. s 1 Mr -?' Burt sat v-> in bet *. only
half believing the news, when the familiar
warning whirr was heard and eight slow
strokes rang out. Tears rushed to her
eyes, every tick-tack that followed seemed
to bring her desolate spirit ba.-k from
some far and friendless waste to the nearn
and security of home, and bid her forget
the pain and humiliation of late rava*in*
her heart. Â° â¢
"A Happy New Year to "cc." said Jos

A few days later, when tho slant au
tumn sunlight was pouring through yel
lowing limes and copper-touched beeches,
a tall young lady In a straw bat and linen
blouse was descending .the wooded slopes
Of Nutcombe place, singing and leading a
sunny-haired child. More slowly a don
key, led by a boy-servant, arid bearing
panniers containing younger children, fol
lowed, picking its steps daintily, surely,
on the steep descent. Down between sun
gilded tree-boles mother and child danced,
singing, till they reached a mossy level
beneath some crimsoned cherry trees, and
sank upon a rustic seat, whence a view of
Nutcombe place, surrounded by its gar
dens and backed by its ancient trees, was
visible.
."Muvver, a story, please." the little
maiden was beginning, when a long shad
ow fell across their feet, and a sturdy,
dark-eyed laborer stood before them.
"Beg your ladyship's pardon," he said.
â¢(Â¦ she looked up in surprise not unmixed
with displeasure. "I make bold to ask 'cc
a favor."
"So it appears. You are not one of our
people."
"No, your la'shlp. But I be Nutcombe
born, son of Ezekiel Woodnutt. carpenter,
that'llves down at the cross-roads by the
stream."
"Ah! Woodnutt, the carpenter, in the
tiled cottage with the vine. Where the
beehives are. Gwenny," she added to the
child, who nodded assent.
"Mr. Barton," continued Joseph with
nervous energy, "was telling of me about
his lordship's place where he looks at the
stars. He was saying, your ladyship, hla
lordship wanted a man a nights, to bide
up long with him and help. So I made bold
to ask 'cc to ask his lordship to give me
the Job."
"Really? But why did you not apply to
the steward or to Lord Sharland him
self?"
"I asked Mr. Williams, ma'amâ your
ladyship â and I'm agoing to ask his lord
ship. Mr. Williams says I ain't man
enough for the Job. Vurry likely his lord
ship won't hae me neither." -,
"But why ask me?"
"Youi- ladyship," he replied, nervously
rumpling his hair, "is a ooman."
"Without doubt. What of that?"
"A ooman, please your ladyship, is ten
derer hearted than a man, and this here
Is for a ooman's sake."
She looked up into the crimsoning face
and glowing eyes, then down upon l.er
little daughter, and smiled. "But," she
said presently, "what do you know about
the stars?"
"I don't know as I knows much, he
replied after some consideration, "but. if
you please, your ladyship, I do wonder a
deal/
"Can you tell me why the days draw
In at this time of year?"
"Well. I allow it's along of the sun go-
Ing south. In a manner of saying-, "tia the
yearth tipped up south end again the
sun."
"And so you wish to sit up shiverins?
and turning a telescope through the frosty
winter nights for a woman's sake? And
I being a woman, am to try to get the
situation for you in virtue of my tender
heart, eh? Very well. Good afternoon."
"But, my dear child," Lord Shariand
replied when the subject was laid before
him that evening. "I want an intelligent
man who can observe and recurd. as well
as fetch and carry, and knock in naiis.
Woodnutt has good work and a share in
his father's business. They rent a few
fields, keep cows, and do all themselves*.
And no man can work both night and
day."
"Not for a woman's sake?" as"ked the
young countess, smiling up in his face.
"Romance! Sentiment! Humbug! What
I want is an intelligent artisan of some
education. The sort of fellow who makes
a good sapper."
"Try my man," she returned, clasping
her hands on his shoulder, and laying her
cheek on his arm; "my rustic artisan,
who thinks astronomy 'miserably inter
esting.' who has 'gone into fractions' on
winter evenings, and is always wondering
about the stars."
"What is to be done with a woman who
gives five and thirty pounds for a shabby
old clock that won't go. and wants one
to spoil one's astronomical observations
for the winter, and perhaps ruin the new
telescope, for the sake of an ignorant
yokel whose native stupidity Is trebled
by his being in love?"
"Try him. dearest. As for his being in
love the woman may be his grandmother.
The clock tells the changes of the moon
and keeps excellent time if wound up.
How kind you are, darling! When do I
ask anything in vain?"
The next Sunday Joseph Woodnutt slept
co soundly during afternoon sermon that
It took several people to rouse him. Wlien
at last he stumbled out Into the church
yard, where Annie and her mother had
stopped to speak to neighbors, his eyes
were glazed and heavy and his words ac
companied by what Mrs. Burt styled "tho
gapes." She began to consider the nat
ural depravity of the human male and his
Inevitable gravitation to public houses
and beer jugs. Even steady Joe Woodrutt
was male, and constantly malign. "What
hey 'cc been at. Joeâ where was 'cc last
night?" she asked with a sharpness she
knew to be indiscreet.
"I ben helping folks measuren of stars
all night." was the too ready reply, most
grievous to Mrs. Burt. who supposed It to
be clang for a night of dissipation.
"Young men will be young men," she
observed, sadly, "and must hae their
fling. Beware of the devil's dancen hours
and spenden good money in bad company,
Joe Woodnutt. avore it's too late."
"His lordship is not. so to say. bad
company, though he do bide up anights,
Mrs. Burt,' was the grave reply. " 'is
mls'able pleasant; I allow, and brings In
good money."
The young couple wished Mrs. Burt
good-by at the turn to her cottage and
she trudged up the bank alone. The aft
ernoon was cloudy and chill; gusts shriek
ed through, the waning woods with men
ace of rain. The sadness of life fell heav
ily upon the widow as she entered her
lonely cottage. The hearth was cold:
Liza absent on business: the kitten leaped
to her with a feeble mew; straight before
her, striking the eye with an ever new
shock, was the place whence the clock
had looked and ticked its quiet welcome.
How heavy the silence was, how harsh
the angry wind howl in the trees!
She sat idle and dejected, her face turn
ed from the vacant wall space, missing
the sound that was' the household voice,
calling the hours of rest and duty. mark-
Ing events and bringing facts and faces
to mind. Without the clock all stagnated,
even time Itself; something that echoed
the slow tick-tacks in her bosom had
stopped, too. When night fell she roused
herself to light her fire, cheered a moment
by its ruddy warmth. But thd kettle's
song. Liza's croon, the scent of tea. all
failed to soothe. As the solitary woman
turned to her table, the firelight showed
THE SUNDAY CALL;
at the iane Â°* aaptrai mdormgnt on thÂ«
orchard grass, then at Annie again, and
a throb of deep passion shook his heart,
and. mingled with it, absolute trust In the
rectitude and good sense of the comely
yeuox woman who loved fr'"-. "You
carren the girt basket," her mother re
turned. "Whatever do 'cc think? Her
la-ship was after wold clock agen, yester
day. She'll give thirty pound for en now
without his innards."
"Don't "cc take it, mother. He keeps
time." with a withering glance at Joseph.
"Why, you'd be entirely lost without en.
And 'twoudn't be the same place to us.
He do look that homely, when we step In.
Her ladyship has clocks all over the place,
all over gold cunids and birds."
"There's clocks and clocks," observed
Joseph, taking heart of grace. "This
here's a fancy clock. Mayn't I ace 'cc
home by and by, Annie'/" rising to go.
"There's fools and fools," she replied,
apparently addressing Liza, "but there
ain't 6uch a fancy fool in this house as
ud wait after eight to be Been home
along."
"Annie," her mother paid when he was
gone, "Joseph Woodnutt is stlddy and
good-hearted. He's put money by. His
lather has the carpentering business and
his yield and cows and pigs and all. Jos
eph can turn his hand to most anything.
I'd liKe to see 'cc go to church long with
he. Don't 'cc set en down too much. A

to-night."
- "Why hadn't he come then, great nog
head, " sne retorted. But she was careful
to watch the clock and leave the cottage
when eight strokes quivered on the quiet
air, and her mother, watching her disap
pear through the wicket, was not surpris
ed to see the gleam of a white smock
through the starlit gloom and to hear the
sound of a man's step In time with An
nie's.
But what had Annie meant by her anx
ious questions touching Jim? "You
haven't seen Jim? You haven't heard
anything? They are all right at Jim's?'
Of course they were. Clever, steady Jim,
risen to be foreman at the poultry and
egg-shop in the town and likely to be
pariner. Jim was the family success;
they all took rank from him. Mrs. Burt's
heart swelled when, on holidays, the poul
terer's light cart drove through the vil
lage, and Jim and his smart wife and
children jumped down and turned up the
path to her cottage. She liked to talk of
"my son James, him that's foreman at
Stevenson's." Her husband had been but
a farm laborer; his children were like to
be wealthy tradespeople, she mused,
turning back to her lonely cottage, where
Liza slumbered and the clock ticked: and
she opened her Bible with a grateful
She had not read far before she heard
footstepsâ and the wicket click and saw
a moving shadow on the lane of light in
the garden. A quick tap on the door made
her heart jump. Who could be coming
bo late? Going to the door she found a
stranger, a town youth, who. asking if
this were Mr*. Burfs. dropped a letter in
to her hand and vanished, before she had
time to speak or see that the letter was In
a familiar hand.
"Dear mother," It ran. "I write in haste
to save time, as young Williams in going
through Nut combe this morning. Come in
straight away. I did wrong, but I never

She fell forward on the table, her head
on her arms, with a heavy sigh. She re
mained thus quite still, while the clock
ticked, the kitten leaped upon Liza, who
waked and played, and a star, visible
through the lattice, passed out of sight.
At last Liza cuffed the kitten off; sprang
on the table and examined her mistress
with profound disquiet and eyes growing
rounder and rounder. Finding neither
mews or purrs availed she gently licked
the still, white face until Mrs. Burt re
gained consciousness, and Â¦with it the
memory of calamity and shame.
On the following Thursday Joseph
"Woodnutt lingered, as he often did after
Ousk. by the orchard '.vail of the farm
whi.j-f Annie served. Now and then he
whistled and looked up at an attic win
dow that shone silvery in a young moon' 3
light, then waited in the dappled shadows,
his hands in his pockets, his figure mo
tionless. A tree heavy with ruddy apples
hung over the -wall above him, the scent
of overripe fruit mingled with the pleas
ant smell of fresh-stacked wheat; save
for the stamp of a stabled horse, the crop
crop of cows munching grass, the rustls
of a mouse and fall of mellow fruit, all
v,as quiet. So quiet that he heard the
click Â«.f a lattice hasp from the roof and
looked up to see It open. Soon after the
rustle of skirts over the orchard grasa
was heard, and the face he expected ap
peared, pale in the moonlight, set In frult
ladcn bough?. Then followed a sound that
poets have likened to the breaking of ripe
fruit, the wall being scarcely breast high.
"It's the last," Annie suddenly Bobbed
after the "silence usually sequent on thl*
time-hallowed rite: "1 mustn't
go with 'cc any more, Jos
eph."
He promptly falsified the
first proposition, as true lovers
should, asking what she meant
by the second.
"Anybody as mp.rries me'll
have to wait years and years."
she explained; "I'm not one to
go a beggar to a honest man,
and every penny I hey is gone."
"I'd sooner wait years for you,
Annie, dear, than marry a mll
lenair's daughter," was the
proper response, "I want 'cc,
my dear."
"Mother has sold the clock." j
Â»>he said, extricating herself
from his arms, "poor mother's ]

But the story does not depend on the
moral. It is a consistent and entirely
natural and impressive tragedy. The
character and experience of Letitia
Berkeley are perfectly possible, and the
development of the plot from the charac
ter and of the character from the plot
are excellently studied. The other per
sonages are also vigorously represented,
and the picture of the student life of
women in Paris is, very vivid. (F. A.
Stokes Company, New York, $1 25.)
Mr. risslng's novel, "The Crown of
T.ife." though the conscious study of sex
but. the circumstances which help to form
them, especially the intellectual atmos
phere they breathe, brings In a multitude
of additional elements, which make great
demands upon the attention in order to
be assimilated with the rest of the book.
If any one thing dominates in import
ance, it is the imaginative intensity of
Mers Otway's amorous nature. One of
the rare beings capable of a profound pas
sion, he early felt its disquieting but en
nobling influence. Led by it in a devious
way, ready -t one moment to lose the
dignity, of his nature in commonplace
sensual ease, at another to take refuge
in. a marriage of kindly affection without
the real nre ; df love, he comes at last to
Intellectual. and moral command of him
self .and' to the fulfillment of his deeply
cherished passion. The foil to Piers is
young Arnold Jacks, executive, clear, sure
of himself and his purposes, proof against
the /illusions of paÂ«sion: and their rivalry
for the hand of Irene Dcrwcnt is really
a confe^t between two opposing principles
of life. Irene's engagement to Jacks, her
vacillation, hor final sudden and Intense
revolt against the sovereignty of com
monplace good sense, and her uncon
scious demand for a recognition of the
empire of natural passion and the ideal
In love, perhaps this movement of Irene's
nature is the most significant expression
of the general meaning of Mr. Gissing's
book.
The novel is one of considerable power,
unequal in execution, and in a way dan
gerous, as the release of a force is always
dangerous. (F. A. jjtofc- Co., New York,
In the verso of Dr. E. R. Taylor- "Moods
and Other Verses' Iâthere1 â there Is a thread,
Flender but genuine, of true poetry. His
work is all refined, beautifully gentle and
the odor of dawn, the howling of dog?, the
sounds of the sea or music, the sugges
tions of condensed words, all expressing
in his poetic faith the "glaf!r.e?s and grief
of dead generations," bestirring "for one
mysterious moment some deep and ex
quisite thrillirrg of voluptuous pain."
The actual ghost stories give the reader
the luxury of a new and appalling thrill
of horror. (Little, Brown & Co.. Boston.
"Songs Along the Way." by Mrs. Emily
Browne Powell is another little volume of
verse in which tender sincerity gives to
some of the poems decided charm. With
less of the technical accomplishment of
verse and less in most cases of the indi
vidual touch that we call style than in
the volume just discussed, the little book;
contains here and there lines of more im
aginative forceâ such as:
"O homesick rhell, thy low Imprisoned roar;"
"Ghosts ride between us on our way.
Their shadowy steÂ»rts press ours apart:
-Against my arm their bridles sway."
This phrase seems to me worthy of a
great poet. The poems alt in all need
concentrationâ such concentration of the
imagination as is expressed in the llnÂ«
just quoted, and they show the need of a
greater study of the little things of style.
Some pleasant poems are marred by a
touch of commonplace In expression. ''The
Story of the Ages." "All Soul's Eve" and
the "Vacation Song" have pleased m*
more than the others. (The Peter Paul
Book Company, Buffalo.)
W. Clark Russeli's "The Ship: Her
Story," is a soberly gossiping account of
tho u_>velcpment oc sea-going craft from
the Ark to the Columbia. In effect, how
ever, it is sailing ships from Sir Kranci3
Drake's day to the middle of uas century
which have really interested Mr. Russell.
The" book is amazingiv free from techni
cality of language. Mr. Russell keeps
that for locaÂ» color in his novels. The il
lustrations, by Mr. Seppings Wright, ar*
both beautiful and interpretative. A read
er with any nautical tastes will find this
book fascinating. (F. A. Stokes Co.. New

"Kimberley proper is built around a hole
big enough to hold the entire white popu

gree in Ainslee's for January. "This is the
excavation above the Kimberley mine,
made when diamonds were mined from
the surface. Nowadays shafts are sunk
and levels formed, whence the blue ground
is blasted out and hauled to the surface
in elevators. The diamond is different
from other precious stones In that it 13

ruby and emerald are embedded in quartz.
This makes the diamond easy to conceal
in the mouth, nose and by swallowing,
and every year the De Beers Compa-iy

stolen goods. The inclination to pilfer
these precious stones is so intense th-it
the crime id severely punished. In South
Africa the first commandment 13 'Thou
shalt not steal diamonds.' What rape is

man may get ten years: for having *
diamond found on his person that is not
registered, twenty years. At Cape Town
is a great convict station called the
'Breakwater.' where sons of prominent
American families and English aristocrats
join in lockstep with Lascars and Kaffirs.
They have all violated the first command
ment. In Kimberley 1000 negro convicts
sort the diamonds under the muzzles of
Maitini rifles. They are kept in a sepi

It remains to be seen whether the con
ception and delineation of the characters

passion and the perfection of its expres

and all drama under classical influences
Is likely to seem to the English reader
weak. In the concentration of the mini

the play the characters are easily slight.-d.
In "Paolo and Francesca" this weakness

This want of individual parable fullness

explain to her. she begs her father to
let her go to New York that she may
learn to live, ar.d not simply be a spec
tator and student, apart from the realities
of the world. She makes her own living
as a teanhtr and as the secretary of a
rich woman, who has forced her way by
hor wealth into the "smart set." Here,
almost by accident and innocent of wrong!
she receives the caresses of a young man
vt fashion, and carried on by her suddenly
ruption soon followed and new so
cieties were organized. Their ar
ticles of incorporation, if they could bo
dignified by such a high sounding title,
were" founded on the same humane lines
as these laid down by the original tongs,
but to quote old 1100 Youk. one of the
shrewdest Chinese philosophers who ever
visited this country, "This was all mouth
talk and contains not one word that
comes from the heart." The real object
of these new tong3 was to extort
blackmail from the keepers of dis
reputable, houses, and when the United
State:; began to tighten the lines on the
Importers of these unfortunate women,
they innocently enhanced the value of
every unhappy female slave landed on
our shores.
With the increase in values came en
couragement for the organization of more
tongs, then came the usual commercial
stumbling block, the law of supply and
demand. There was no longer blood
money enough to go round and the high
binder found it necessary to include oth
er classes in his levy, so he began on the
respectable merchant. In order to ac
complish this some sort of consistent
story had to be invented to precede the
demand. To the full-fledged highbinder
this came a trifle easy.
The method adopted by these leeches 10
extort money frcm their countrymen was.
and is to-day, as follows: The members
of the highbinder tong hold a meeting
whenever they find it necessary to raise
the. wind, they resolve themselves info a
committee of the whole and select one of
their smoothest talkers. to call upon some
well-known merchant, the agent of the
tong to represent himself as a sort of mis
sionary who calls to solicit alms for the
approaching celebration on the install i
tlon of thfir new idol in their modest lit
tle temple of worship, which they are do-
would be only too happy to lend his "In
significant shopkeeper name," as he ex
presses it. if it would in any way help
their tÂ«ng. But. really, business careÂ«*
are so absorbing, he is too much pressed
for time, and he declines the doubtful
honor with many regrew.
Now the missionary tries another tack.
"Well." he explains, "everybody knows
how rich and generous the great master is.
:md we are sure, if he cannot find time to
honor us with his presence, he would not
object to making a small donation, for the
glory of the new idol and its little temple,
say about two hundred dollars. It would
be repaid by the prosperity that i 3 sure to
follow generous deeds."
Hut the master fails to see It in that
light, and with greatest politeness thankj
the missionary for his promises of pros
perity, and bows him to the door. After
the missionary has gone the merchant
finds a small scrap of paper crumpled up
on his counter; he opens it and reads
something like this: "If the master of this
house persists in ignoring the requests of
the little temple which ha 3 been built by
his poor but honest countrymen, the
writer greatly fears that some great dis
aster may occur within the next week
which would cause great pain and suffer
ing, possibly death, life is so uncertain."
Should the merchant still refuse to sub
mit to this demand for blackmail, his
death follows as surely as if all the idols
in Chinatown were in league against him.
This wholesale form cf blackmail and
murder soon brought about another com
bination. Many merchants, in order to
protect themselves from the ravages of
these thugs, became members of their
tongs, paying a light tribute annually.
This arrangement. In its turn, brought
about the vendetta and established a
hired band of assaslns, who have ever
sir&e infested the Chinese quarter of thij
city.
There are in all thirteen prominent
tongs located in San Francisco, most ot
them fairly prosperous. They are com
posed of what one might call active and
associate members. The active members
are the fighting m^n and those who hve
about the headquarters of the tnn?s, and
as a rule the long membership is their
only visible means of support. The asso
ciate membership, on the contrary, is
made up of some of the best behaved mer
chants and house servants, who are sim
ply coerced into belonging to these orders
for self-protection, nine-tenths of whom
would gladly desert if they had the cour
age to do so, but they haven't.
The vendetta is the feature that is
brought most prominently to our notice.
These brigands. In order to protect them
selves, or rather to intimidate fighting
men of rival tons?, have sworn to avengo
the death of every member of their re
spective societies, so if you were to read
in to-morrow mornings paper that a
member of the Hip Sings had been found
dying on the sidewalk the night before,
you may rest assured that a Suey Sins

It may teem a bit strange to the casual
reader that the police have never been
able to suppress this warfare, which U
waged in the very heart of the city, as U
were, but there are many reasons why it
is almost an impossibility. In the first
place, these people have the ad%antage of
a language which seems -Â»s mysterious
and as deep as the grave itself: one may
spend a lifetime trying to learn the ver
nacular, and then rind himself stumped
with some new form of prison slang, and
he is as much in the dark as he was in
the beginning. The people absolutely re
fuse to testify against each other, even
the merchant class, for they realize the
penalty. Of course the merchant class
would do anything in reason to clear th*
city of this pest, but thry are helpless.
There is little danger of the?" murderers
ever being caught in the act. for they ara
as well posted on the movements of every
police ofllcer as is the sergeant himself.
and they always choose their time with
marked good Judgment. Their wonderful
similarity of feature and form renders
identification almost an impossibility.

ed by detecting him in 1 a falsehood, de

to understand the meaning of what she

lost in her work when her old lover comes
before her to offer her marriage. To this
step he has been forced by Mrs. Ball, the
rich woman for whom Letitia had acted
as secretary, and who had taken this
step from a desire of revenge. The motive
of hrr anger was her knowledge that the
young man's mother had tempted .Mrs.
Ball's husband into adultery with her, and'
a consequent desire to humiliate the
mother. Letitia scorns her suitor, .and

BRITONS HANDICAPPED
BY ANCIENT ARTILLERY
NEW YORK. Jan. 6â Belated stories of
the war in South Africa are arriving
from London by mail. Among the many
criticisms of British artillery none has
attracted more attention than that writ
ten on November 12 at Ladysmith by the
Standard's war corespondent. There 13
a frankness In it which doubtless would
never have passed the censor, yet Its de
tail and the evident knowledge of the
writer upon artillery matters stamp it
with undeniable truth, however unpleas
ant reading it makes for the British pub
lic. Summing \up this correspondent
says :
"The disadvantages under which we
have labored have been demonstrated re
peatedly... At Elapds,Lkagte.4wo officers
and two men of the First. Field'Battery
were wounded at a range beyond that at
which they could fire shrapnel. > Except
In reconnoissance our field guns are use
less as long as the siege lasts. The Boer
shrapnel Is fused for 5200 yards, whereas
our fuse ceases to be effective at 4100
yards.
"The meaning of this will be clear when
I say that for lino yards, or nearly three
quarters of a mile, our artillery are ex
posed to the fire of a practically invisible
enemy without being able to fire a really
effective shot in self-defense. In other
words, our guns would never get within
effective range of a French or German
field battery. We must have a gun that
will shoot with much greater accuracy at
s<v)o yards and a fuse that Is effective at
5000 or 6000 yards. Our equipment is un
duly heavy. Our guns carry too much
weight. The double teams that brought
the Twenty-first Battery to Elands
Laagte, a distance of fifteen or sixteen
miles, had not an ounce left In them. This
is the first time that the British army has
faced modern artillery, and the lessons to
be learned will be of the greatest value.
Already we have discovered that with the
aid of smokeless powder anrl long ranges
the enemy may be invisible, and that
when he is raining shot and shell upon
us, and that days may pass without dis
closing the position of some of his guns
and howitzers. The Boer has an advan

CECIL RHODES READY
TO ESCAPE IN A BALLOON
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. 6.â Cecil Rhodes does not intend to fall into the hands
of the Boers if he can help it, not even If Kimberley be taken. The people
are not a little nervous on that score now, because they lack faith in General
Methuen, not In courage but in his tactical powers.
The Colossus, who, like Napoleon the Great, always considers the worst
which might take place In any situation which he finds himself, has faced
the possibility of the fall of Kimberley and tried to provide for his personal
safety In that event, for he is only too well aware that the Boers, were he
to fall Into their hands, would shoot him without mercy.
Mr. Rhodes' plan of escape Is simple. He has a first-class balloon at
hand and should Kimberley fall the balloon will bo seen ascending with
four occupants and sailing away. Those passengers would be the Colossus.

la^t week there has been plenty of ex
citement over war news from various
seats of military operations, it was re
served for last night to bring what is In
Its possibilities probably the most impor
tant tidings of seven days.
During all day yesterday there was a
marked absence of news from South
Africa, and the London vendors of news
papers were at their wits' ends for a line
to shout out to attract the attention of
the public.
It was not till practically everybody
had gone to bed that a bulletin was Is
sued by the War Office in the shape of
an exceedingly brief dispatch from Gen
eral White saying that Boers in consid
erable force, whatever that may mean,
had made an attack on his forces at
Caesar's Camp at an early hour yester
day morning and had been everywhere
repulsed. No further details are yet to
hand.

GREAT BRITAIN'S CASE

"WASHINGTON. Jan. <?.â Secretary Hay
cabled to Embassador Choate to-day ad
ditional Information supplied by tho
Pennsylvania Milling Company relative
to flour on board the British and Dutch
steamers seized by the British cruisers
In South African waters. Tho informa-
toin submitted by the Pennsylvania Mill-
Ing Company was embodied In a formal
complaint, the first received from this
corporation. The original complaint and
the one upon which the action was taken
by the department was submitted by
Messrs. Flint. Eddy & Co. of New York,
who are also Interested in the cargo.
The Pennsylvania Milling Company
stated that It had flour on each of the
vessels and that It desired the department
to take such steps for Its release or for
reparation as might be deemed advisable.
The Secretary instructed Mr. Choate to
present the information to Lord Salis
bury.
No confirmation has been received at
the department of the release of the
etcamcr Mashona and the holding of the
cargo preparatory to further judicial pro
ceedings. The release of the steamer. In
the opinion of officials at the State De
partment, further weakens the case of
the British Government. It has been sup
posed here that the vessel would have
been held for violation of municipal laws
and also on a charge of conveying sup
plies to an enemy of the kingdom, but the
decision of the prize court indicates, the
officials state, that the court is of the
opinion she was engaged in a legitimate
operation. As Great Britain has not de
clared provisions to be contraband of
war, and as the steamer, it has been offi
cially decided, was not engaged in illegal
trade, the authorities say that the posi

SEIZURES CONSIDERED
L.ONDON, Jan. 6.â Lord Salisbury came
Meeting of the British Cabi
net Committee of National
Defense.
Seated In the large armchair la
Lord Salisbury. Prime Minister
and Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs. Partly behind him, stand
ing, are Mr. Goschen, First. Lord:
of the Admiralty, on the left, and
Lord Lansdowne. Secretary of
State for War. on the right. Mr.
A. J. Balfour. First Lord of the
Treasury, is seated at the table,
with pen in hand. The Duke of
Devonshire, president of the Coun
cil, leans against the chair in the
foreground. A map of South Africa
hangs before them, and they are
all intently discussing the situa
tion.
LONDON, Jan. 6.â The War Office this evening issued the following:
â¢' From Builer, Frere Camp, January 6. The following telegram was received
from General White January 6, 9a. m.: ' The enemy attacked Caesar's Camp at 2:45
a. m. in considerable force, The enemy was everywhere repulsed, but the fighting still
continues,' "
General Buller's telegram that the enemy had attacked Caesar's Camp at 2:45 a. m.,
and that the fighting was still in progress, caused many later calls at the War Office in
expectation 01 the receipt of additional news. The officials stated at midnight, however,
that nothing further would be issued during the night. No news has been received from
other sources, although the dispatches indicate that important events at the front are
imminent if not actually progressing at this time.
It is stated to-night that the British note in reply to the representations of the United
States Government on the subject of the seizure of American goods by Great Britain will
be given to Embassador Choate on Monday.
DURBAN, January 6.â The German steamer Herzog has been seized by a British war
ship and brought to this port.
LONDON, Jan. 7.â General
French has not been long
in taxing advantage 01 the
reinforcements which he received
at dawn yesterday morning. He
made a determined assault on
_ . Â¦Â¦Â¦. /â , ,
the Boer positions at Colesberg,
in which all his available artillery,
cavalry and infantry were en
gaged.
In his official report, issued
yesterday, of the repulse last
Thursday of the Boer attack on
his left flank General French bays
that the enemy s evident omect
was to reopen communication
with Bactu. He says also that
the Boers were yesterday dis
closed five miles north of Coles
berg, located in a fresh position
with two heaw guns, and that
they were still in force to the
southeast of the town.
Though the stringency of the
censor toward press dispatches
continues, sufficient facts have
come to London to suggest that
an important move at Tugela
River is imminent. General Bul
ler is busy reconnoitenng the po-
Eition of his enemy, though one
should hardly dignify any of his
operations with the title of re
connoissance in force, as was
done by one correspondent s tel
egrams.
The most important recon
noissance appears to have con
sisted wholly of mounted troops
with two field guns, under
Lord Dundonald, which, cov
ered by the nre from some long
range naval guns, made an ef
fort to feel the strength of the
Boers occupying Mount Inhlawe.
The Boers are reported to have
replied with rifle fire at long
range, but refrained from disclos
ing their positions and contented
themselves with a demonstration
on the British outer flank, which
made the retirement of the small
force desirable.
We read also that the Boers
had a heliograph, presumably on
a mountain top, signaling their
headquarters camp at Lmbul
wane during the action. I ex
pect the Boers have a very com
plete system of signaling" in
working order to facilitate the
rapid reinforcement of threat
ened points by troops now
camped in the central situation.
We are told that the Tugela has
fallen and that the river is ford
able at the usual points, conse
quently we may assume that the
bridge which the Boers had

AMERICA WARNED
AGAINST GERMANY
LONDON. Jan. 6.â The Spectator to-day
publishes an article entitled "Germany
and the Monroe Doctrine," In which it
Â¦ says:
"America and not England is the rival.
In German opinion. It is with America,
and not with England. Â¦ that Germany
realizes she must struggle for supremacy.
We do not say -for Â¦ a J moment that Ger
many regards America as an enemy, but
Germany realizes It -is America that at
the moment lies across Germany's path,
and unless she is able to -reckon with
America on equal terms she will not be
come the world power In the future that
she desires to be."
The Spectator then goes . on to declare
that Germany's objective Is South Amer
ica, but that the 'Monroe doctrine bars
her :way. - How. to get around* this Jls
puzzling, but the paper declares Emperor
"William counts upon the GÂ«nnan vote la
the United States to help him when his
new navy Is ready to carry out his South
American expansion Idea, especially la
Brazil:
The Spectator then warns the United
States, that If It Intends to uphold the
Monroe doctrine in the future It must
not go to sleep over It now, but prepars
to support a navy and army equal to the
Â¦train of maintaining a policy so tremen
dous. If not. she Is certain to suffer great
humiliation at the hands of "the patient,
efficient and persistent Germany." Tha
paper adds:
"when the hour comes Germany won't
be bluffed Into respect of Monroeism. She
will call the American fleet, and If the
fleet Is no higher than hers, Germany
will act."
OFFERED TO MAKE
A LOAN TO PORTUGAL
LISBOX, Jan. 6.â A semi-official note to
the press regarding the Anglo-German

as follows*: lifcirr
"The British and German Governments,
having previously reached an agreement
between themselves, informed Portugal
that in the event of her contracting a
large loan for the purpose of reorganiz
ing the finances the two Governments
â¢were disposed to guarantee the success of
the operation. At the same time the
Governments of Great Britain and Ger
many assured Portugal that the basis of
the agreement between them was the rec
ognition of the integrity of the Portu
guese colonial dominions and the legiti
macy of Portuguese sovereignty over the
Portuguese possessions. They fujrther
suggested that in the event of Portugal
accepting a proposal concerning a loan
the latter should be guaranteed by the
colonial and custom receipts. The Portu
guese Government then declared that it
had no need for such a loan. and. accord-
Ing to our Information, has no such nÂ«ed
at the- present day."

LIVES LOST IN A
TENEMENT FIRE
Three Persons Dead and
Seven Injured.
NEW YORK, Jan- 6â A tenement house
fire In East Ninety-second street early to
day resulted In three deaths and neven
persons being badly Injured. Following
are the dead:
MRS. MART SUTHERL.T, & widow.
FRANK SUTHERLY, 9 years old.
JAMES BUTHERLY, 22 months old,
both sons of Mrs. Sutherly.
The Injured: Harry Sutherly, 6 years
old, critical; Raphael Pitizzo, bruised;
Fire Lieutenant Stone, Fireman Michael
Edran. Michael Sullivan. Charles McCar
thy. Martin O'Leary, overcome by gas
and smoke -
The fire, which started in the cellar, had
paired much lundway before the firemen
armed. A policeman aroused the tenants.
Harry Rutherly was found unconsi-lous In
the hallway on the second Jloor. The boy
had made his way out of the room, but
could pet no farther. It Is thoupht he will
die, as he lnhnled flames. Ladders were
raised by the tiremen and a number of
women and children, who had collÂ«_'dÂ«->i
urÂ»on the fire escape on the front of the
building, wore scfely carried down.
Raphael Pitizzo. who lived on the third
floor, took his family of three small chil
dren down the rear flre escape to the sec
ond floor.-- where he was cut off by the
flames. While clinging to the flre escape
he was compelled to pass his children
over a twelve-foot fence, surmounted with
spikes, which separated the tenement
from the adjoining house. His arms were
cut by the spikes, and when he saw the
children all in safety he collapsed and
fell, Hustainlng bad bruipos.
When the firemen were about to enter
the building they found the dead body of
Mrs. Suthrrly lying face down with her
dead baby In her arms. A few feet from
her on the floor lay the half-burned body
of her boy Frank. The damage to the
property is trivial.
The Hamburg . Correspondez doubts
whether this Is the right time for Indig

Coal Is getting dearer dally, and the

Into proportions of unheard-of munifi
cence, while the papers, when not magni
fying indecisive skirmishes into brilliant
successes, devote casual attention to the
difficulties which have arisen over the
seizure of cargoes bound for Lourenzo
Marquez. In the latter respect the
Bundesrath incident almost monopolizes
the attention, the seizure of American
flour being relegated to a very subsidiary
position and not being taken as having
the slightest possibility of producing in
ternational friction.
On the whole, the British press has
taken a calm view of the German seizure
matter and has refused to be led Into re
plying In kind to the bitter comments tel
egraphed from Germany. In this the pa
pers merely voice the feeling of the Gov
ernment, for at the Foreign Office not the
slightest anxiety is felt regarding the ac
tions so far taken against the alleged con
traband, -though that question in the ab
stract causes no end of cogitation, but
more regarding the effect the present dif
ficulties will have upon future events than
by thepress of contemporaneous difficul
ties. The British Government believes it
has a good case against the Bundesrath;
but both in this instance and In the case
of the American flour the Government
holds that absolutely nothing definite can
be done until details . have been learned.
Even then the fine points of law must be
settled by the carelul deliberation of ex
perts. In the meantime It is possible the
Government may deem it advisable to
make declarations regarding contraband,
especially foodstuffs. Such a step is quite
problematical. To quote an American
diplomat in London, who, after reading
the cabled account that the United States^
insistence upon her rights might cause
trouble, said:
"How in the world do they think such
a complicated point of law can be settled
or cause any serious disagreement be
tween people so friendly as the 'United
Stutes and England?"
Commenting upon the American feeling,
the Saturday Review says: "We fear no
accurate presentment of the real feeling
of the United States regarding the war
reaches this country, but there is no doubt
the balance Is against us. The adminis
tration organs and financial organs are
still strongly with us. but the latter are
beginning to waver, because the war Is
beginning to injure trade. It must not
be forgotten how completely the adminis
tration ip in the hands of the great finan
ciers and trust companies." . .
The arrival in tho United Kingdom of
five United States Government doctors to
Inspect shipping bound to America for bu
bonic plague has created some astonish
ment, as the ppecial precautions against
the plague were given up last month at
most of tho European ports, while no case
has ent^rtd an English harbor. At Hull,
one of the ports not assigned a doctor, a
severe . outbreak of smallpox is raging,
which, so one United States Consul in
formed a representative of tho Associated
Preps, possessed far more danger than
the bubonic plapue.
Admiral Melville writes to the Globe

contraband. The Bundesrath is shown to

from the bank. This was made public at
a meeting of depositors this morning by
I'rtsident Rea of the bank, who said such
action was unanimously taken at the
meeting of the directors yesterday. It is
said that the securities that are missing
are in the shape of mining stock that was

Koss.
â¢ A meeting of depositors who have not
yet sued the bank was held in Sleeper
Hall this morning. About 150 were pres
ent. William Vinter presided as chair
man and N. B. Wretma-ii was secretary.
A ieport of the committee appointed to
>-eÂ«r 11 a pettlenient of the baiiK'a affairs

was read, it staled that atler a careful
Investigation the asseis of tne institution
had been estimated as follows: Good and

*!iiuunt is declared solvent, it would bring

Hive nearly JSMJ.OuO to pay an indebtedness
of (761.000. The report indorsed the action
of board of directors having the liquida
tion of the bank in charye, and recom
mended that all stockholders who should
pay the $70 per share assessment be re
leased from all further liaoiluy. The
committee stated that seventeen stock
holders, representing about 1000 share*,
wire willing to pay assessment.
This view was not taken by a vast ma
jority of thobe present and the meeting
became a lively one. The old straw that
has been thrashed at former meetings
was worked over again.
Attorney S. G. Tompklns addressed the
meeting in behalf of some of the stock
holders, and asked the depositors to be
lenient in thtir demands, lie said the
stockholders acted fairly, and eaid they
had offered to turn over the bank's as
sets to the depositors and give them be
lies $150,000 II released from all claims
and liability. He thought the offer. should
be accepted, and linaliy raised the bonus
to $175,0u0.
This caused a general storm. President
Kea was seated in the room and he was
called on to state whÂ«n another dividend
would bÂ« declared. He said the deposit
ors were sure to recover all their de
posits. A dividend of 10 per cent would
be declared probably by the Â£uth of this
month, and not later than February 1. Ho
denounced Ward Wright as a scoundrel
and said the bank had been robbed His
speech was a characteristic one of the ex
polltlcal boss, lie scored Attorney Tomp
kins and others and praised himself and
family, lie stated Attorney Welch, who
represents the organized depositors, was
conniving with some of the stockholders
and If it had not been for himself and
others the attorney would have let the
bank's stock be sold for assessments
levied to the bank and the depositors
would have lost every cent they had.
J. Letter, a heavy stockholder, then
criticized Rea's management of the bank.
He said in the year elapsed the expenses
of the bank had been excessive and noth
ing- was accomplished.

be the sense of the meeting that fco per

WOULD REWARD
NAVAL OFFICERS
Secretary Long's Note
to Congress.
PRESENT SYSTEM UNJUST
URGES THAT OTHEB METHODS
BE SUBSTITUTED.
It Is Pointed Out That Captains Who
Participated in the Santiago
Battle Have Been Un
fairly Treated.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.â Secretary
Long: has addressed the following letter
to the chairmen of the- committees on
naval affairs of the Senate and House,
embodying the department's latest views
as to the method of rewarding: naval of
ficers who participated In the destruction
of Cervera's fleet off Santiago:
Sir: The department has the honcr to suggest
that the present system of rewarding officers
of the navy and marine corps for "eminent and
conspicuous conduct in battle and extraordinary
heroism," under the provisions, respectively, of
sections l><i and ltiCi of the Revised Statutes,
has been found to be unsatisfactory, since tn
Its Impractical application it operates un*ti3tly. j
and In some Instances defeats the purpose to: i
which It was devised. At the present time
some officers who rendered distinguished serv- |
Ices during the war with Spain have, in recog
nition thereof, been advanced upon the list:
others remain without reward of any kind: I
ethers still, by the curious operation of the ex- I
lstlng system, find themselves in lower relative
positions than they occupied before the war of j
1599, In which they so gallantly participated.
An Illustration of the objectionable operation
of the present method of rewards is afforded by
the case of Captain Charles E. Clark. U. S. N..
who commejided the Oregon during the memor
able run of that vest-el from Paciflc to Atlantic
waters and at the battle of Santiago, and ><?t.
owing to the promotion over him of Captains !
Gridley, Coghlan and Dyer, for their eminent
and conspicuous conduct in the battle of Manila
Bay, Is to-day two numbers â and If Captain
Gridley had survived would bÂ« three numbers â
lower on the list than If the war had never oc
curred.
Vigilance, prudence and capacity, unremit
ting and sustained, wisely meeting as they
successively arise the countless details of the
management of a battleship, establishing and
maintaining the morale essential to good woris
and bringing the vessel Into effective action at
a critical time are qualities which entitle an
officer to share In rewards. If any are given,
for distinguished naval service. These qualities
were exhibited In a high degn?e by the officers
participating In the battle of Manila, who have
been rewarded by advancement on the navy
list. They were also exhibited by other officers,
particularly those who so conspicuously and
meritoriously participated In the battle of San
tiago, and yet have not In any way been re
warded.
Where officers have bravely anJ with jealous
patriotism acquitted themselves In difficult cir
cumstances with uniform success an analytical
comparison of their respective achievements ib
practically impossible, since all the varied cir
cumstances of the several cases can hardly be
taken into full and accurate account. It Is,
however, deemed to be the duty of the depart
ment to bring to the attention of with the rec
ommendation that early action be taken by Con.
gress the matter of the general question of the
inadequacy of the present system of rewards
and to request that remedy Is to fixed In the
provisions of certain measures now before Con
trress. One of theseâ that is Senate bill 230.
Fifty-sixth Congress, first sessionâ provides
that the advancement of the rank of officers
of the navy and marine corps for war service
shall not Interfere with the regular promotion
of officers otherwise entitled thereto. This
measure is similar to Senate bill Â£ovo. Pirty
fifth Conrress, third session, which was pre
pared by the department, and has, I am in
formed, already passed the Senate at its pres
ent session, and if enacted Into law will in the
case above cited, for example, hay* the effect
of restoring to the officer concerned the num
bers lost by advancements heretofore made
under the present system.
The others of these Is Senate bill 50C3. Fifty
fifth Conzress, third session, "Provldlne for
suitable rewards for officers and men of the
navy and marine corps for exceptional an.l
meritorious service In the line of duty." This
measure is believed to afford a satisfactory
substitute for the present method of rewards.
would enable the department to confer upon
the officers above referred to the medal therein
designated as the "honor medal." with its at
tendant advantages and benefits, and would, it
Is thought, provide equitable recognition in
the cases cf other officers of the navy en
titled thereto by reason of exceptional servica
In the line of duty.
In consideration of the Importance of this
general question the department urgently re
quests that it may receive ruch early attention
of the committee as Its convenience will sug
gest. Very respectfully,
JOHN D. LONG. Secretary.

EXTRADITION REFUSED.
Governor Kogers Decides That Arm
strong Is Not a Fugitive.
SEATTLE. Jan. 6.â Governor Rogers to
day refused to honor the requisition of
Governor Tanner of Illinois for the extra
dition of William Armstrong and his al
leged wife on a charge of adultery. Ha
held that the papers did not show the de
fendants to be fugitives for the reason,
that It appeared that their alleged crime
was known to tha Chicago authorities
months before they left Chicago and no
effort was made to prosecute them, and
that Armstrong had been in custody in
Seattle months before he was arrested oa
the adultery charge.
Armstrong was arrested in this Stat<Â»
last July en the charge of conspiring to
defeat public justice of Chicago. At that
time the Governor honored the requisition
of Governor Tanner, but Armstrong sued
out a writ of habeas corpus. He was sub
sequently ordered released by the Su
preme Court, and then the effort was
made to extradite him on the adultery
charge. Â¦Â»

RANCHES INUNDATED.
Damage Done by the Sudden Bise of
the Salinas River.
MONTEREY. Jan. 6.â The report comes
from Salinas River that the country round
the mouth of the river for several miles Is
inundated, causing serious damage to
farmers In that locality. The fall of the
river, produced by the cessation of the
rain, has changed the swift current into
one of Insufficient power to cut a way
through the bar at the mouth, and a
heavy back water is the result. The
Cooper and Mqro Cojo ranches are from
five to six feet under water and some of
the ranch houses in the district are full
of water to a depth varying from three to
five feet. Several small houses have been
moved by the overflow of water. Boats
have been in use for two days to rescue
the inhabitants from their uncomfortable
positions. No loss of life is reported, but
the damage to property Is considerable.
It is also reported that the dam at the
river's mouth, caused by the sand-bar. Is
giving way. und it Is hoped the flood will
soon subside.
A thousand acres of beets in this section
that have not been harvested, owing to
lack of cars to transport them to Spreck
els sugar factory at Salinas, have prob
ably been ruined by the flood, and if this
proves the case It means a loss of about
$15,000 to the ranchers. The beet growers
still hope, however, that If the water sub
sides at once the ground will dry before
the beets, become rotten. Reports from
all along the river state a rapid fall of
water since the rain stopped.

Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyrighted. 1900. by James Gordon
Bennett.
SAN* DOMINGO. Jan. 6.â The French
Consul has severed diplomatic relations
with the Santo Domingo republic and
asked that warships be sent hither. They
are now on their way. The 250.000 francs
($55,000) demanded by France are ready
for payment. The people's behavior Is
correct, and they are giving no offense to
French residents. The United States gun
boat Machlas has left this port.
ST. THOMAS. D. \V. 1.. Jan. 6.â The
French liagshlp Cecile has gone to Santo
Domingo. It is reported she was called
there hurriedly by cable.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Reliable in
formation has been received here that the
French Consul at Santo Domingo has In
formed the Jlmlnez government that a
squadron will soon arrive at that port to
enforce payment of installments remain
ing due In' the matter of the Boisemare-
Cacavelll claim.
Instructions will be sent to Rear Ad
miral Farquhar. now with the New York
In the West Indies, to either proceed with
his vessel or to send the Machlas, which
arrived to-day at San Juan from Santo
Domingo, to the capital of the little re
public and give adequate protection to
American interests. In providing such
protection. Admiral Farquhar will co-oper
ate with the American diplomatic repre
sentatives at Santo Domingo. There is no
disposition on the part of this government
to prevent France carrying out its pro
gramme, providing it does not attempt to
seize any territory; but. to quote an of
ficial with whom I talked. 'This govern
ment would sincerely regret to witness
the coercion of Santo Domingo by the
Paris government."
Smith M. Tweed, who is understood to
be an important factor In the Santo Do
mingan company, which Is financing the
little republic, is reported to have gone
to the island to look out for the interests
of his corporation.
It is appreciated that If France demands
immediate payment of the remaining
amount due. this will have to come out
of the revenues, which are controlled by
the company. The company, eonse
'quentlv-, will suffer. As pointed out this
morning, several nations are interested in
the company by reason of stock therein
owned by their citizens, and the matter
: may become a subject of representation
by "each of them to France.
There is no doubt that the officials sym
pathize with France in this matter, as
they are endeavoring to obtain the re
maining installments, long Finoe overdue,
owing in the matter of the Ozama bridge
claim. This claim was submitted to ar
bitration and decided in favor of the
claimant, Nathaniel McKay. All but $40.
000 has been paid, and, though the Jiminez
government agreed before its recognition
by the United States to assume the obli
gations of the Heureaux administration.
It has made no move to settle the re
mainder. I understand that some days
ago an instruction was pent by Secretary
Hay to Mr. Powell directing him to vig
orously push the Jlmlnez government for
a settlement of the claim. This Instruc
tion was sent before the French govern
ment decided to instruct its squadron to
proceed to Santo Domingo. It is not to be
expected, the officials say. that Santo Do
mingo will be able to pay in one lump
about $100,000, the aggregate amount of the
French and American claims, and it Is
hoped that an arrangement will be made
whereby partial payments at specified
periods will be agreed to.

CONCESSIONS TO
FRUIT SHIPPERS
Decided Improvement in
the Situation.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.â With the close
of the first week of the contest between
the citrus fruit shippers of Southern Cali
fornia and the initial lines the Southern
Pacific and Santa Fe situation is decidedly
improved and shippers have gained con
ceÃsions that were not believed possible on
January 1, the date when the new order
preventing shippers from routing became
effective.
This result has been encompassed by
two factorsâ in the Santa Ke tacitly,
through Traffic Manager Chambers agree
ing to route cars when convenience to
shippers could be proved, and President
Rlpley's agreement to submit the ques
tion to a conference that will go Into the
merits of the dispute. This conclusion of
Ripley -Is the outgrowth of the demand
of the financial and commercial interests
of Los Angeles. When the contest seemed
fiercest and the railroads remained un
yielding the Chamber of Commerce, Board
of Trade, Merchants' and Manufacturers*
Association and the Clearing-house Asso
ciation engineered quite a fiank movement
that demonstrated to the roads that the
entire strength of the moneyed interest
was aroused to rescue the orange indÃs
try. Local railroad officials were not con
sulted.
The first intimation that Chambers and
Luce of the Southern Pacific had came In
Inquiries from the East demanding infor
mation as to what the telegrams reciting
the growers' grievances meant. Xo fur
ther action will be taken by citizens until
Huntington replies, whose silence is re
garded as part of a plan to be cunning
and shift responsibility.
Over sixty cars were to-day shipped and
in each case the company did the routing
at 90 cents a box. but a legal protest was
served with every car. No rights are
waived.

Paying Teller of a Buffalo Bank
Takes Advantage of the Sec
retary's Absence.
BUFFALO, N. V., Jan. 6.â The state
ment Is mado that F. A. Newton, paying
teller of the Fidelity Trust and Guarantee
Company, has embezzled $45,000. The fol
lowing statement has been Issued by tho
bank:
"On Thursday evening, Dwrmher 14,
1539. the president and secretary of tho
company were advised that Fred L. New
ton, one of Its trusted employes, who had
been acting as bookkeeper and paying
teller, was a defaulter. A prompt exam
ination disclosed the fact that Newton's
cash was short to the extent of precisely
$45.000. Tho trust company held the bond
of the American Security Company In the
amount of $10,000. The surety company
was at once notified of the defalcation,
and on the ISth day of December. 1599, the
surety company paid the $10,000, being the
amount of its bond, leaving the trust com
pany with a loss of precisely $38,000.
"Newton had fled the city on the even
ing when the discovery was made. He
returned, however, voluntarily and was
temporarily left in the custody of his
counsel. He was prepared at any time
to plead guilty and take the consequence.
"When Newton left town he knew that
the bank examiner would be in attendance
the next morning. The examiner was
promptly advised of the information pos
sessed by the president and the secretary.
He was asked to make the most thorough
examination. This was done and every
thing was found in perfect order. Tho
officers are unable to cay precisely when
the money was taken, but it Is thought a
large part of It was secured during the
absence of the secretary In attendance at
the deathbed of his father."

SACK IN EVIDENCE IN THE
SENATORIAL FIGHT.
Large Sums Offerd for Votes by
Agents Alleged to Have Been
Employed by the Mil
lionaire.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Henry C. Stiff.
Speaker of the Montana House of Repre
sentatives, was the first witness tn the
Clark case before the Senate Committee
on Privileges and Elections to-day. Rep
resentative Campbell of Montana ques
tioned Stiff and his questions were direct
ed to showing that tne embarrassed fin
ancial condition of State Representative
McLaughlin had been taken advantage of
by Senator Clark to approach him to se
cure his vote, and also that Stiff's own
vote had been Improperly solicited. Stiff
said that ha knew that McLaughlin was
in distressed financial circumstances prior
to the meeting of the Legislature. Ha had
himself been approached by W. M. Blck
ford, acting representative of Clark, and
his support solicited for the latter.
The questions bringing out this informa
tion were all objected to by the defense,
who insisted that Clark must be directly
connected with all the transactions with
which it was sought to connect his name.
The reply was that his connection would
be shown over Clark's signature.
The questioning of Stiff was then direct
ed toward showing that Blckford had
sought to secure Stiffs services to exam
ine the title of property to be purchased
by Clark from McLaughlin for J25.000, a
part of the consideration on McLaughlln's
part being, Bickford specified, that Mc-
Laughlln should support Clark for the
Senate. Stiff testified to the correctness
of this outline and added that Blckford
had told him that he (Stiff) should receive
$500 for his individual services, when $50
would have been a good fee; that his own
vote was wanted for Clark, and that he
should be put on Clark's list of attorneys
for a number of years. Bickford had, in
this connection, exhibited a list of prop
erty to be sold by McLaughlin, with prices
to be paid, which were in excess of the
value of the property, and this property
was afterward conveyed to Clark.
Stiff s=aid that the agreement with Me
Laughlln provided that he was to be em
ployed by Clark for two years at $2400 a
year, and that McLaughlin had since been
employed in this connection. McLaugh
lln had voted for Clark.
The witness said that in another con
versation with Bickford. a week prior
to the meeting of the Legislature, the lat
ter had offered him $10,000 if he would
withdraw from the contest for the
Speakershlp and support Clark for the
Senatorship. Stiff also detailed a con
verpation with A. D. Cook, former State
Auditor, who had offered him $20,000 to
vote for Clark.
"I made no definite reply," said Stiff,
"because I wanted to further inve^tigata
what was going on. I told him that if
Clark roally wanted to secure my vote he
could afford to pay more than 120,000, and
suggested $50,000. saying I did not want
this to be understood as an offer on my
part. Cook said he would see Clark and
we agreed to meet again that day. I
did not. however, see him again on this
subject."
He said that as Speaker, in selecting a
committee of Investigation in the Clark
matter, ho had not known all the mem
bers selected were unfriendly to Clark.
Replying further to questions concerning
his suggestions of fcX).O.>oas the price Clark
should pay for his vote, he said:
"I believe I was perfectly justified in
doing what I did. I considered that a
most outrageous crime was being perpe
trated and that I was willing to act the
part of a detective."
Fred Whlteside, Montana State Senator
from Cleathead County, testified that he
had been approached prior to and after
the meeting of the Legislature in the in
terest of Clark's candidacy by John S.
Neill. John B. Wellcome and Charles W.
Clark, a son of the Senator. He had seen
Wt-llcome by appointment at his room
at a hotel in Helena, and had met there
others of Clark's friends. Ho had met
Senator Clark also, who told him that
Wellcome had spoken favorably of him
(Whiteside).
ThÂ« first intimation he had that his
support of Clark would be to his financial
advantage came from Neill. Afterward
Wellcome told him that his vote for and
support of Clark would bo worth $10,000.
He had co-operated with the Fupporters
of Clark for the purpose of exposing the
corrupt methods which he was satisfied
was being used to secure Clark's election.
He exhibited a list of the members of the
L^KiÂ«lature whom Welloome and Clark's
son had requested him to see. They had
told him they were willing to pay $10,(K>0
for any Democratic vote, and more for
the vote of J. T. Anderson of Meagher

FINAL ARGUMENT
IN ROBERTS CASE
Close of the Hearing In
Committee.
POLYGAMISrS LAST APPEAL
. - .-".. - Â¦Â¦ .- >Â¦. -Â¦Â¦Â¦ . - '
DECLARES HE IS PERSECUTED
BY GENTTLES.
Ridicules the Assertion That tho
American Home Is in Danger
Through His Election to
Congress.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.â When the Rob
erts committee resumed Its Investigation
to-day Roberts went on with his argu
ment, begun yesterday. He reviewed the
action of the Constitutional Convention,
of Utah, urging that this carried out tha
requirements of Congress for the admis
sion of Utah as a Stateâ namely, that
polygamous marriages should no longer
be contracted. In particular, Roberts
contended that there was no requirement
by Congress or the Constitutional Con
vention that previously contracted matri
monial associations should be Interrupted.
In the course of his argument Roberts
said he had observed that the ladles In
volved in this question of plural wives
were quite generally received In the cir
cles of gentile ladles In Utah. He vehe
mently denounced what he characterized
as the sensational crusade made against
him, and also the effort to arouse public
feeling by saying "the American home"
was In danger.
"If necessary." he Bald, "I could call
attention to ten thousand evils which
threaten the country without going to
the State of Utah."
In closing Roberts said that the patriot-
Ism of the Mormon Church toward the
country could not be questioned. When
a fund was raised for the survivors of the
battleship Maine the Mormon Church had
contributed one-fifth of the entire amount.
When the country's authority In the Phil
ippines was questioned "Utah's guns,
handled by Utah men. had been In the
fore front of the fray."
Schroder, the gentile Representative.
said that no further point would be made
on Roberta' naturalization papers, as It
was desired to exclude him from Congress
specifically and solely on the ground of his
being a polygamist.
After, the arguments closed members of
the committee attached some importance
to the question asked by Chairman Tayler
of Roberts, relative to the latter being
amenable, while in the District of Colum
bia, to the Edmunds act. It Is understood
that special attention may be given by
the committee to this feature.
At 12:30 the arguments on both sides
were closed and the committee- went Into
executive session.
At the executive session It was decided
to close the hearings and the testimony
unless ex-Secretary Carlisle desired to be
heard further. The committee then ad
journed until 10 a. m. next Wednesday.
There was no vote or other action on the

this abuse of the veterans. The fact was
acknowledged by the governor of the

CLOSING WEEKS
...OF OUR GREAT...
COMMERCE AND MINING.
Q"* ENATOR FRYE, chairman of the Committee
on Commerce, has been making strong efforts
* â to bring about at this session the creation of
a Department of Commerce under the direction of a
Secretary of Cabinet rank. He is reported to have
said in a recent interview: I here is a universal de
irand from commercial organizations that such a
department be created. In the last Congress peti
tions and memorials in favor of it were sent in large
numbers to both houses. I have reintroduced the bill
with some amendments widening the scope of the
proposed department, and it is now in charge of a
very energetic sub-committee, and I think myself safe
in predicting early and favorable action upon it."
As outlined in the reports from Washington the
bill provides that the Department of Commerce shall
have jurisdiction over foreign and international com
merce of the United States, except in that which re
lates to the collection of the revenue and the admin
istration of custom and internal revenue laws; it
shall have charge of matters relating to the manufac
turing interests of the countr>'i the extension of for
eign markets and the increase of trade facilities with
foreign countries. The following bureaus are taken
out of the Treasury Department and are put under
the jurisdiction of the new department: The lifc
taving fevice, the Bureau of Immigration, the Bu
reau of Statistics, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the
United States Shipping Commissioners, the Bureau
of Navigation, the Bureau of Steamboat Inspection,
the Marine Hospital Service and the Lighthouse
Board. The department of labor is transferred to this
department, and so is the Consular Bureau of the De
partment of State.
There is hardly likely to be any question of the de
firability of creating the proposed department. Our
foreign commerce has now reached such vast propor
tions and is so rapidly increasing, that its affairs so
far as they are affected by the Government cannot be
adequately attended to by the State and Treasury
officials. It is said that at present Congressmen have
to send to as many as a dozen different bureaus for
the purpose of getting information concerning com
mercial matters when legislation affecting them is
under consideration.
The strength of the movement for establishing the
Department of Commerce will of course have the
effect of reviving public interest in the demand from
the mining States for the creation of a Department of
Mines and Mining. There is hardly any argument
used in favor of a Department of Commerce that
cannot be used with equal force for the other. Mining
is a vast and rapidly expanding industry. Its affairs
are now directed through a dozen different bureaus,
and so great is the confusion that it is difficult to get
a ruling upon a simple question of mining laws. It
would be of great advantage to have all the Govern
ment activities relative to mines and mining gathered
into one department and placed under the direction
cf a single head.
No reason exists why the commercial and the min
ing interests should antagonize one another at this
juncture. By combination they may succeed in pro
curing the establishment of both departments, and it
is to be hoped ther will do so.
RAILWAY MAIL PAY.
ONE of the notable features of the recent hear
ings by the Congressional Commission ap
pointed to investigate railway mail pay was
the testimony given and argument made on the sub
ject by Mr. Finley Acker of Philadelphia, and it is
gratifying that a digest of his statements has been
prepared for circulation throughout the country.
They serve to enlighten the popular understanding of
the question and will do much to strengthen the de
mand for a reduction in the exorbitant rates now
paid to the roads.
For the purpose of defending their position the
railway companies have employed statisticians to
compile estimates showing that the present pay is not
excessive. Mr. Acker takes these statistics and by
analyzing them proves the conclusions drawn from
them by the railroads to be false.
Last February certain postoffice statistics were
given out which showed the average haul of maU
to be 328 miles and the pay averaged 40 cents per
ton mile. Since then, however, railroad experts,
for the purpose of making their case stronger,
have submitted other calculations which indicate that
the average haul of mail is 813 ton miles and the
rate is consequently reduced to 12^ cents. It is
these latter statistics that Mr. Acker subjects to
analysis, and the result is disastrous to the contention
of the railroads.
Calculations of this kind are complex. The
primary factors which enter into the cost of any form
of transportation are: First, proportion of "dead"
to paying load, and space accommodations; second,
speed; third, length of average haul; fourth,
weight of average shipment; fifth, character of ser
vice, whether daily or spasmodic; sixth, cost of all
the details inherent in the securing, handling and
managing of the respective classes of traffic.
Taking all these factors into consideration, Mr.
Acker concludes that the fixed Government rate for
hauling 200 pounds of mail daily the full length of
the average mail haul is $94 77, while the cost for
hauling the same weight of passengers the same dis
tance would, at the lowest commutation passenger
rate, be but $2 07; or at first class freight rate hi
$1 36, or at the sixth class freight rate only 45 cents.
The above represents the rates for the lightest mail
routes, but, jumping to the opposite extreme and
taking the heaviest mail route, which is approximately
300,000 pounds daily, it will be found that the rate
fixed by the Government for hauling this weight the
full distance of the average mail haul (813 miles)
would be Â§73*7, while a similar weight of passengers
carried the same distance would-be at the lowest com
mutation rate $3121 02, or at first class freight ratc3
be $2048 76, or at the sixth class freight rates $6&2 92.
It must be borne in mind, moreover, that railways
ought to haul mail more cheaply than any other form
of freight because for the mails they do not have to
maintain any warehouses or clerical help. The issue
is the more important because upon it depends the
establishment of one cent postage for letters and a
cheap parcels post. So long as exorbitant rates arc
paid the railways for hauling mail those needed im
provements cannot be undertaken. It will be seen,
then, that a reform in the direction of economy in
railway rates should be promptly carried out.

beneficiaries of the protective tariff assemble in
Washington and by lobbying with their Senators and
Representatives induce them to Â¦ go into 'log
rolling' schemes by which enough opposition can be
'corralled' and united to prevent ratification. We
may be permitted to point out that these treaties are
not the work of theoretic free traders, but have been
prepared under the direction of President McKinley,
and have met with his approval, and yet, simply be
cause they are for public rather than private interests,
they are likely to be defeated by protectionist votes."
These attacks on the part of the opponents of pro
tection are not to be ignored, for there is an element
of sound reason in them. If any break occur in the
protective system by means of reciprocity, then there
will be danger of the whole system giving way. There
should be protection for all or protection for none.
"SOAK THEM GOOD."
rROM statements made to a correspondent of
-the New York Times by leading business men
in the South it appears that the favor with
which the renomination of Bryan is regarded in that
section is not based upon any great liking for the
Nebraska man or his platform. In fact, the South
is now more prosperous than ever before, and the
leaders among her people arc eager to rid the Demo
cratic party of the calamity howlers who now domi
nate it, but they discern no better way to achieve that
than by giving them free rein this year and letting
them go to destruction.
A gentleman of Birmingham, Alabama, gave his
views of the situation in this way: "Alabama will
send a Bryan delegation to the National Convention.
We expect to see Bryan nominated again. No; I did
not say that I want to see him elected. Let us name
him in obedience to the persistent Democratic de
mand that he shall be tried again. For the nomina
tion for Vice President I would suggest some young
and confident man from the East, as we cannot get
Sewall again, offering it, perhaps, to George Fred
Williams. Personally, I would like to see these nomi
nations on a ticket with the motto, 'Soak them good.'
None of the old politicians expect to see Bryan
elected. This town has been described as being full
of 'McKinley Democrats.' There are some of them
here. They do not care to try any experiments that
may result in the lifting of this blessed cloud of
smoke from the furnaces and coke ovens. We must
stand by the organization, however; that way lies
our political safety at home. That's all."
Nominate the old ticket and then soak them good.
That is the political wisdom, it seems, of the South
at this juncture. The policy is not altogether the tac
tics of despair. Many efforts have been made to find
a new leader for the Democratic party, but all have
failed. The efforts of Tammany, of Gorman and of
a number of Southern conservatives have been alike
fruitless. It appears, therefore, about the best plan
possible under the circumstances is to offer no further
opposition to the Bryan movement within the party,
but to leave it to the fate that awaits it at the hands
of the whole people on election day.
Were it not for the unfortunate complications re
sulting from the race antagonisms in the South there
would be a large Republican vote cast in those States
this year, and some of the more important of them
could be carried for the Republican ticket. No por
tion of the Union has enjoyed a greater degree of
prosperity under the tariff and financial policies of the
administration than that section, and the growth of
manufacturing industries there has been well nigh
marvelous.
It is but a few years ago since the Southern people
were devoted almost wholly to agriculture, and in
that gave most of their energies to the production of
a single staple. The country was hardly much further
advanced than the interior of Russia. Almost every
thing in the way of manufactured goods was imported.
A very different condition prevails there now. In a
recent review of trade conditions the Manufacturers'
Record of Baltimore said: "To-day the South has
$1,000,000,000 invested in manufacturing, with an an
nual output valued at $1,500,000,000, and paying $350,
000,000 in wages. Its cotton mills, with 5,000,000
spindles, representing an investment of $125,000,000,
already consume yearly 1.400,000 bales of cotton. It
is producing about 2,500,000 tons of pigiron a year,
40.000,000 tons of coal, from 10,000,000 to 11,000,
000 bales of cotton, probably 10,000.000,000 feet of lum
ber and 750,000.000 bushels of grain, and its railroads,
steadily improving and increasing in length, have al
ready a 50,000 mileage."
Is there any wonder that a people enjoying so much
of prosperity should desire to rid their party of the
domination and their country of the menace of Bryan
ism? Is it strange there should be "McKinley Demo
crats" all through the South? Bryan's chances of a
renomination are excellent, for those who are most

RECIPROCITY AND LOG-ROLLING.
AMONG the advocates of the reciprocity treaties
now under consideration it has become the
fashion to refer to the objectors to them as a
"log-rolling opposition." That term is applied be
cause the various States whose interests are adversely
affected by the treaties have combined to defeat them.
It is the argument of the reciprocity men that such
methods of opposition are pernicious, since they set
up "special interests" in antagonism to the welfare
of the whole country.
The force of that argument depends wholly upon
the play upon words. Reciprocity and log-rolling
are, in fact, well nigh synonymous terms. Each
means that one party confers a favor in expectation
of an adequate return. .If it be permissible to ar
range a treaty with France by which we agree to give
certain commercial privileges to that country in ex
change for equivalent privileges, it is also permissible
for the representatives of one State in the Union to
arrange with those of another to make a fight for the
advantage of both. The justness of the two agree
ments is not to be affected by calling one "log
rolling" and the other "reciprocity."
In issues of this kind the object of our Government
should be to provide for the common good of all the
States. There is no reason why the fruit and wine
industries of California should be called "special in
terests" any more than the industries of the East
that are to be benefited by the treaty should be called
special. If the representatives of California,
Nebraska, Ohio, Louisiana and Florida who have
united to oppose the treaties with France and
Jamaica be log-rolling, so is the combination of the
representatives of other States who are upholding
the treaty. So far as that is concerned honors arc
even.
Republican leaders can hardly overlook the fact that
these unfortunate treaties have had the effect of re
viving the hopes and the energies of the free traders,
and that if persisted in they may result in bringing
upon the country a renewed agitation of the whole
tariff question, with a consequent disturbance of our
industrial activities. The free trade organs have, in
fact, been prompt to take advantage of the opening
offered, and they are already discussing reciprocity
to the disadvantage of the protective system. Thus,
for example, the Boston Herald, in commenting upon
the objection to the treaties, says: "If we had a
tariff based on revenue, and not on the greed of in
dividuals and corporations, then concessions made
for the purpose of benefiting the general trade of the
country would be acted upon by Congress in a broad,
general manner. As it is, a trade treaty which may
be of benefit to millions of our people is blocked
and its ratification prevented because a few score
A PRUSSIAN PROGNOSTICATION.
OF all the predictions and dreams of what may
be achieved by nations and races during the
twentieth century that have been put forward
for the instruction or the entertainment of the world
perhaps the most interesting to us is one which the
New York Sun has dug up from a programme of
the future outlined by a German publicist in the
Preussische Jahrbucher. The writer sees for Ger
many and France a grand career on this continent as
well as elsewhere, and thus presents his view of it:
"In the British Dominion of Canada of to-day there
live about 1,300,000 Frenchmen, and of 211 representa
tives of the Canadian Parliament not less than 55 are
Frenchmen by descent and language. Besides, the
attempted revolts of 1838, 1569 and 1885 have proved
that this French population has by.no means lost
consciousness of its past and its national rights. If
thereto be added those Frenchmen who to the num
ber of about 500,000 live scattered, but as French
men, in the United States, there exists in case of a
French-English conflict a reserve of French strength
upon which a resolute French policy can build with
hope of success. Then, however, the moment would
have arrived when it should be the task of Germany,
in co-operation with France, whose sphere of in
fluence would be the eastern half of British America,
to attempt to gain a foothold from the West in the
regions on the Pacific Ocean and to try whether it
be impossible to arouse the two and three-quarter
millions of Germans in the United States from their
'national lethargy,' and to induce them to lay, with
the assistance of the fatherland, on British ground
the foundation of a colony on the Pacific Ocean."
A scheme which divides Canada into different na
tionalities by means of a combined uprising of Ger
mans and French is certainly entitled to high con
sideration by all who delight in the good-fellowship
of rousing romance. That it should be advanced at
all is an evidence of the high ideas which the Ger
mans have of the future of their imperial career.
There would not be such extravagance in the minds
of men intelligent enough to write accurately were
there not a deep feeling on the subject among the
German people. It is pretty well understood that the
Kaiser aims at establishing an alliance with France,
which, with that already existing between Germany,
Austria and Italy, would make a virtual federation of
Western Europe, with Germany at the head of it.
Then could be undertaken with comparative safety
the effort to break up the prestige of the empires of
Great Britain or Russia, as the Kaiser might deem
most advisable.
Such dreams have been running in the minds of
German jingoes for some time, and some of them
may be realized. The scheme of dividing Canada,
however, is not so much a dream as a nightmare.
The publicist who advanced it ought to take some
thing to cool his head.
Susan B. Anthony recently broke the record for
eighty-year-olds in a three days' visit to Detroit, dur
ing which she addressed a business college, three
women's clubs, attended two banquets and a luncheon

susceptible of as many answers as there

pointed to positions under the city covern
ment: â¢
"All deputies, clerks, assistants and oth
er employes of the city and county must
be citizens of the United States, and must.
during their respective terms of office or
employment, actually reside In the city
and county and must have so resided for
one year next preceding their appoint
ment." â¢ \ -
By a careful reading it will be seen that
the one year's residence refers to "next
preceding their appointment," not appli
cation. A person might mako application
and not receive appointment for mere
than a year after. As to eligibility of re
turned California volunteers from Manila.
It Is possible that the Commissioners will
hold that a man while In the service of
the United States does not lose his resi
dence.
CHESSâ O. E.. Pacheco. Cal. Chess is
such an ancient game that Its origin is
unknown. Many of the most learned
Oriental scholars have written upon the
subject, appealing to history and philol
ogy to support their theories. It has
been ascribed to a Chinese manadarin by
the name of Han-Sing, who. It Is said.
Invented it as an amusement for his sol
diers in winter quarters about 174 years
before Christ. They call it "the play of
the science of war." Sir William Jones,
the great Sanscrit scholar, claimed that
Hindu traditions, the names of the pieces
and other particulars Indicate that chess
was played in India in the earliest times.
He wrote that a learned Brahmin assured
him that it was mentioned in several cf
the oldest books of India, where It was
declared that it was invented by the wife
of one of the most ancient Kings of Cey
lon to amuse that monarch while Rania
besieged his metropolis. This, by their
reckoning, was two or three thousand
years before the commencement of our
era. On the other hand, several later
scholars of Sanscrit think It was invented
by Buddhists, some time between the
third and ninth centuries, A. D., a theory
inconsistent with the unwarlike nature of
Buddhism and the fact that the Hindu
name of the game, "chaturanga." is a
military name, signifying "the game of
armies." Others have ascribed this game
to Babylonians, Persians, Scythians.
Egyptians. Jews. Greeks and Romans.
but the weight of evidence is in favor of
its being of Indian or Chinese origin.

IS WELCOMED
BY HER FRIENDS
Returns Home After
Fourteen Years.
SEVILLE INCIDENT RETOLD
Kmma Nevada, one of the great singers
that California has sent out upon the
world to win fame In many countries, ar
rived at the Palace last night. The prima
donna will give two concerts In this city,
the first to-morrow night at the Califor
nia Theater. Her journey to San Fran
cisco has been one long ovatidn, punctu
ated by concerts in all the leading cities
of the country.
Mme. Nevada Is .accompanied by her
husband and daughter, who is 13 years of
age and who gives promise of being such
another songstress as her mother. At
the Sixteenth street station, Oakland, the
diva was met toy Mrs. Mills of the Mills
Seminary and several friends whom Ne
vada numbers among the Intimate asso
ciates of her girlhood days.
"I sang in Reno last night," said Mme.
Nevada, "and you can't Imagine how
happy 1 was to be among the friends of
ray childhood. My reception was most
cordial and enthusiastic. Of course I am
a Californian, but was taken to Nevada
In my Infancy almost. I wish I could stay
here a month; it Is so lovely to return to
a home where flowers such as are seen
nowhere else in the world flourish in lux
uriant abundance."
Nevada then turned to a large table In
her room that was completely nidden be
neath floral pieces large and small, saying
at the same time that this was the coun
try for her.
In regard to the incident in Seville last
April when Nevada was hissed and hooted
by the Spaniards simply because she was
an American, the prima donna has the
following to say: "Oh, it was dreadful.
I< or many years I have been a favorite In
Spain, and I thought nothing of appear
ing before a Spanish audience. On this
occasion I was singing 'Lucia,' and I
sang as I never sang before, although the
parquet and the boxes were empty, the
result of intention and malice on the part
of those who never before missed one of
my performances. When I discovered the
reason of the cold house I redoubled my
energies and my patriotism boiled over.
The first act was finished and no ap
plause; the second act witnessed the same
result, nothing but the chill of an Icy up
per house. The manager of the theater
came to me and advised me to withdraw,
fearing violence, but I refused and fin
ished the performance. The next night
the house was packed, but not out of
honor to me, for the audience came with
the Intention to insult me. The ladles
turned their backs toward the front of the
stage, and even thM did not daunt me. I
sang my best and for my singing gained
their applause, but the woman was
hissed. Forgetting themselves they gave
me several encores, only to hiss when I
came to the front in acknowledgment. It
was really a fearful night. The next day
I started to leave the country, but was
forced to change my plans on account of
the solicitations of the Queen, who in
sisted on my accepting an invitation to
the court at Madrid, where I sang before
her and was honored by an official recep
tion."
Nevada is In the best of health, but a
little wearied after her trip. After her
San Francisco concerts she will go to LO3
Angeles and then East en route to Paris
which is now her home.

To the Editor of thÂ« Herald: Common
cense would dictate that nineteen centu
ries must contain 1900 years complete, or
21.500 months. Any one arguir.g that the
f.r<t century ccnr.m^r.ced with the year 1
must necessarily argue that the first cen
tury closed with the close of the last day
of the year 19>. and consequently the
dneteenth centory must close with the
last <lay of the year 1900. A person who
bad ridden ISS9 miles and one lap, who
would claim to have ridden 1900 miles.
would r.ot receive credit for common
ccr.se. It would be no more than fair to

Sinple Question of Arithmetic.
To the Editor <if the Herald: It may
ret be useless to the Her&M readers to
posed date of his birth was correctly
taken, when would he be 190) years old.
or. In other words, when would he begin
his twentieth century? It 13 evident that
not until he had finished his first year
was he one year old and beginning his
second year; not until he had finished
his tenth year was he 10 years old and
beginning his second decade; not until
he had finished his hundredth year
would he be 100 years old and oeginnlng
bis second century", and not until he had
completed hie nineteen hundredth year
would he be 1300 years old and entering
his twentieth century-
The whole question then turns upon
whether the first year of hi 3 life is to be
called year 1 or year nothing. In all
reckoning with mathematical terms we
deal with unit* and aggregates of units.
To make up 100 we must take 100 units,
and to make up 1900 we must take 1900
units. If our unit is aÂ«year we require 100
years for a century and 1900 years for
nineteen centuries. Suppose we bad twenty
hundred logs, divided into piles of 100 each,
or twenty centuries of logs. On these we
are to keep a primitive record of time by
cutting a notch on the first log erery
day for a year from the birth of Christ
and burning it on the first Christmas an
niversary, and then proceeding to do the
same with the second and ail the suc
ceeding logs for the second and follow
ing years. It requires but a moment*
as the writer can lay claim to. the twen
tieth century begins the first instant of
the first day of January. A. D. 1301, Just
is the first <fentury began with the first
day of the first month of A. D. L As a
matter jof fact, no one know 3 when it
begins, as the correct date of the birth of
Christ Is unknown, and ia not likely ever

Century Has One Hundred Years.
To the Editor of the Herald: Will you
please set people rtght? Thexa are so
many people confused about when the
end of the century- is. Of course each
one thinks he is right-
Are there not !?0 cents In a dollar and
100 years In a century? Ergo, as Gobbo
Bays, next year December 31. 1300. will
close the nineteenth century, and January
1. 1901. will begin a new century.

To the'Edltor of the Herald: If not
ungallant to differ from a woman. I
would like to state that if Margaret Z.
Dodd owed $1900, or 1900 years' ser
vice, she would learn that even 1599
and 959-1000 does not make 19C0. In other
words, a thing is not whole until it is
complete, and we are not at the end of
the nineteenth century until we shall
have reached December 31. mfdnlght. 1900.
and begin to say 1901. Then begin* the
tolling of the twentieth century, another
become Instructed on the use of the fig
ure naught (0) as a final or terminal of
each decimal. Neither a decimal nor a
century could by any possibility begin
with a naught. Nor could the end of a

way than ISOO. ISOO. 2000. 3000. etc. A new

reasoning power is required only In mod

One Hundred Complete Years to

To the Editor of the HeraJd: Allow me
to criticize the "Century Diagram" of
Marram Z. Dodd by calling attention to
a fact which It falls to note that a group
of ten or of 100 years is not complete
until the end of the tenth or of. the one
hundredth year. Therefore 1900 years are
nor. past until the end of ISOO, and we be

Tanforan Results.
A mammoth furniture car could not
have contained the coin the crowd at
Tanforan wagered yesterday on Forte.
Schreiber's horse ruled an even money
choice for the last event on the card
and the books were fairly besieged with
money. Forte waa practically left at the
post with only four facing the barrier
and Corrigan's Chimura carried oft all
the honors. After making a wonderful
run the favorite made a heroic bid for
the purse, being beaten but a length, al
though the winner may have had a
pound or two in reserve, which is doubt
ful. This fact only tended to further in
cense bettors, who saw their coin pan
roasted through bungling work of the
starter. Following the usual precedent in
such cases Caldwell fined Bullman. the
rider of Forte $100 for "his" stupidity.
The track was dead and slow time was
the general rule. Four first choices were
ruthleealy slain.
Barney Schreiber's handsome Balwogan
filly, Sofala, against which i to 1 was
laid, had the honor of capturing the first
two-year-old sprint of the year. She ran
like a tried performer, beating out Cor
rlgan's Rathgar four lengths.

assumed the front position, leading to
within eighty yards of the wire, where
Albert Baldwin collared and beat her out
a scant length.
The mile selling run went to Red
Pirate. Nine to ten at post time looked
a good price against the chestnut horse,
and he won with apparent ease. Sum
mer, an BS-pounder. made all the running,
but tired the last furlong, losing the
place to Alicia. The start was a very
ragged one, Mldian being left.
In the mile and a quarter event Daisy

of her company. Potente made al! the
running for a mile when Jenkins gave
the first choice her head and she won
hands down. Scotch Plaid finished a close

speed, but has evidently lost his form.

DISAGREE
ON MERITS
OF BOXERS
Adherents of Neill and
O'Brien Each Claim a
Victory.
The sporting men who attended the
Neill-G'Brien fight on Friday night are
unanimous in the opinion that It was a
one-sided affair. As to which man had
the better of the sharp engagement there
is a wide diversity of opinion, which no
amount of argument can reconcile. The
friends of O'Brien point to the number of
blows he landed, and the Nelll men show
that none of them were effective.
On the other hand. NoIIl did terrible exe
cution on O'Brien's body, as was evi
denced by the efforts the latter made to
get away from them and the pained look
on his face when they landed. It Is gener
ally conceded that O'Brien is one of the
cleverest boxers in the country, and that
he would show brilliantly In four or Fix
round bouts. He Is not the stiff puncher
his size would lead one to believe.
Men who bet on Nelll believe that what
he needs more than anything else if a
professional second who understands his
business. Such a man would have sent
Nelll In to fight when O'Brien was palpa
bly In trouble Friday night, instead of let
ting him get a much needed rest. This
ia not the first time Nelll haa been handi
capped by having Inexperienced people in
his corner who have held him back at op
portune times. His tactics of letting
O'Brien hit him, at will when he found
there waa no sting In his blows deceived
O'Brien's followers, who thought Nelll
was tired and could not fight back.
Nelll went Into the ring a strong favor
ite. When the betting opened on Friday
O'Brien waa favorite, the odds varying
between 10 to 8 and 10 to 9. During the
day there was a steady play on Neill. and
a big commission placed at a late hour
sent him into the ring a strong favorite.
There was $4434. bet in the Paris mutuels
at Harry Corbett's. Persons having Nelll
tickets on the line in which the fight end
ed drew $4 So for each dollar invested. The
O'Brien adherents drew $( 40 under the
same conditions.
The purse was divided, each man, It is
said, receiving $1011. The men in the pre
liminary received WOO. the lion's share go
ing to Green. Both Nelll and O'Brien ex
press a desire for a return meeting. They
met in the Hammam baths after their en
counter in Woodward's Pavilion and held
a short discussion on the nght. The young
California middleweight Imparted the in
formation to his late opponent that he was
fortunate the police stopped the bout, oth
erwise he would have been knocked out.
O'Brien good naturedly told Nelll that ho
was a good fellow, but he did not know
what he was talking about.
O'Brien was on the streets yesterday
afternoon, and had no scar nor bruise to
give evidence of his engagement of the
previous evening. He afttrms the blow he
landed on NeiU's stomach was a fair one.
and also that when the police stopped tne
fight he should have been given a decision
on points. He stated that If the blow
was foul Nelll should have been given the
decision.
"I was waiting for Just such a punch,"
said O'Brien. ' I knew I would get the
opportunity, and when it came I let a
straight left go to the pit of the stomach.
I have never In my fifty contests fouled
a man, nor have I been admonished for
doing so. Nelll blocks well, but he cannot
hit a hard blow. He jolts well, but he
cannot punch effectively two feet from his
body. lam perfectly willing to meet him
again at the same weight. I will be ready
in three weeks' tlnu- to fight him again
if satisfactory arrangements can be
made."

on January 1, 1530, he had lived a full half century.
If he were living now he would, next Monday. January

My father was born March 7, ISOO. Now. we will say,
instead of March, he was born January 1. 1500. His age,
like the age of all babies, was counted by months until
twelve of these had fully passed: then he was called one
year old. And was one for another twelve months,

The ninety-ninth year begins no new se

first century was drawing to an end. On
the last day of the one hundredth year
the second century was awaited as the
year A. D. 10L Just as the figure naught

completed century lfX). 200. 300, 400. etc.
The mathematical completion signified by
the recurrence of this figure is not a ques
tion for common sense to decide â since It
belongs to the science or arithmetic. One
hundred, therefore, represents ten series
of tens, SOD represents twenty series of
tens, or 20 multiplied by 10; 100 taken ten
times represents 1000. To represent this
operation we add a naught (0) to the fig
ure 100, thus making it 1000.
The last year of the first decade. was
the year ten (X), not nine (IX). The last
year "of the first century was not the year
99, but the year 100 Itself. At the end of
the ninety-ninth year the one hundredth
year began, but the second century could
not begin till the one hundredth year had
run its full twelve months. Thus, by in
ference, the year 1593 is the eighteen hun
dred and ninety-ninth year, but the hun
dredth year will have to be written 1900.
At the end of *the year 1900 the nineteenth

not before. The following January. A. D.

simply ISO 9. When we add ISOO-rIOO it
will be 1000. And that begins and

Professor George Davidson Suggests
a Commercial Museum for
This City.
Professor George Davidson of the Uni
versity of California lectured before the
Mechanics' Institute last night on "The
Commercial Museum of Philadelphia."
Professor Davidson visited the museum
and attended the Commercial Congress
last fall as a delegate from various of
ficial bodies of San Francisco and his
lecture was an acount of what he saw
there.
In his description of the great museum
the professor said that as an advertising
medium for the merchants of this country
and the products they Bell it stands with
out an equal.
Representatives from Berlin, who had
been delegated to Inspect the museum of
Philadelphia, on their return home at
once advocated the establishment of a
museum of the same character.
Manufacturers, who are members of the
institution, can find within its walls the
raw productions of all the countries of
the world and by an elaborate index sys
tem can obtain complete information as
to its cost, Import duties, tariff, etc., at
a moment's notice. The museum is the
work of far-seeing citizens of the Quaker
City, who suggested the plan and with
the aid of the municipality and the State
made it a reality. The museum Is con
nected with every trade center of the
world and keeps an up-to-date record of
the standing of the merchants and manu
facturers thereof. It receives reports
from over 2000 foreign banks and has a
list of 10,000 special correspondents, who
keep the museum thoroughly acquainted
with the relative value of foreign prod
ucts as compared with those of the
United States.
Professor Davidson declared that such
an institution lnÂ» San Francisco would
make the city one of the greatest trade
centers of the world. There Is no rea
son, he declared, why the United States
should not control one-half of the Im
mense traffic of the Pacific Ocean ln
etead of the present small percentage.
Philadelphia has offered this city 10,000
duplicates of its museum samples, and
with only a., branch museum San Fran
cisco could look to the Pacific, with Its
great distance of shore line and innumer
able ports, for an Immense increase of
exports.

The Shew Hing Benevolent Association
will bring suit early next week for J20.000
damages and costs of the action against
the city and county of San Francisco, ex-
Chief of Police Lees and the Chinatown
squad for entering its rooms at 751 Clay
street without warrant of law on the 6th

. The Shew Hing is a member of the Six

torney J. N. E. Wilson the members of
the association set forth that on the data
mentioned the Chinatown squad forcibly
entered their rooms, and ignoring the pro
tests of the president, wno was present,
broke open trunks and boxes and other
wise conducted itself in an offensive man
ner, all of which was for the alleged pur

The claim Is made that the police hayÂ©

Young Lady Bid Not Attempt to

There is no Jor.ger any mystery sur
round:r.g the "burglary" at the Burling
ton early Thursday morning, in connec
tion with which a young lady was ar
rested and forced to spend severai hours
la Jail. The woman accused of the crime
is Miss Mary E. Bowen, a ward of W. S.
Zeilin. the well known clubman and drug
merchant. The alleged burglary was all
"a mistake." according to H. M. Duncan,
who caused the arrest, and when the fair
defendant's case is cailed in Judge Con
l&n's court cext Tuesday the prosecuting
witness will not be en hand and Miss
Bowen, who waa booked. aÂ» "Mary
Brown," will of necessity be given her
freedom.
The friends cf Miss Bowen now openly
declare thai she has been the victim of a
conspiracy and that she did not steal any
money Iron L>uncan and made no attempt
to get away with fc)6 diamond nng. The
young lady is still suffering from the ef
fect* of the drujj that was given her and
has no recollection of how ehe went to
the Burlington and how she came to be
in a cell at the. City Prison. Duncan has
been settled with and now expresees re-
STet that he was so hasty In having the
young woman arrested.
It is known that the young lady was
drugged before s>he met Duncan, and no
one can account for the fact that ehe
should enter his room while he was
asleep. Her own satchel, which con
tained JOO, an<S her umbrella, on which her
name was engraved, have not been recov
ered and were undoubtedly lest while she
was suffering from one of the fits to

DEATH OF WILLIAM O. BROWN
Heart Disease Suddenly Carried
Au-ay the Neu-s Agent for the
Coast Division of the S. P. Co.
William O. Browr., manager of the
D^nl^on X^v," Company, was found dead
!n br-<5 yesfrday at his residence. No. 262fl
Howard street. Mr. Brown had been suf
fering v.lth heart disease for several
months under the care of Dr. Bunker, and
there Is no dcubt that ailment was the
cause of his death.
Mr. Brown was a prominent member
of the Masonic fraternity, being a pact
master cf California Lodge No. 1, F.
and A. M.; a member of California
Chapter No. 5. R. A. M.; of Golden
Oate Commandery No. 16. K. T.. and a

the general news agent of the Coas>t Di
vision of the Southern Pacific Company
with his offire at the railway depot, cor
ner of Third and Townsend streets. The
frirndf of the deceased were very much
shocked when they heard of his death,
for though they knew that he had been
ailing he was able to attend to his bust
nrts. and was not believed to be seriously
ill.
The ras* was reported to the Morgue.
hut when Coroner Hill was made ac
quainted with the farts he waived an In

signed by Dr. Bunker.

SAN FRANCISCO'S sympathies
are with the Boers If the gath
ering last night, that filled Met
ropolitan Temple and overflowed
until It blocked the street in front of
the building, can be taken as a crite
rion. The meeting was called for the
purpose of extending moral Bupport
and material aid to the struggling lit
tle republics of South Africa, and it
seemed that the whole city wanted a
voice In the demonstration. Tele
grams of congratulations from all sec
tions on the work undertaken were
read. The lion' 6 tall waa severely
twisted, and had several knots tied In
it. and the eagle screamed. When it
was suggested that money would aa
tist greatly in letting the Boers know
that the people of the West were with
them coin was showered on the plat
form. In addition to the cash contri
butions there were some checks that
went Into the three figure class.
In the midst of the hurrah for the
Boers some one suggested that the sit
uation in South Africa was not so
very different from the case of the
Filipinos. The thought was in har
mony with the sentiments of the audi
ence, for It cheered and cheered and
then endeavored to introduce Into the
resolutions that were adopted the
came expression of sympathy for the
"little brown men" as that extended
to the forces of Oom Paul.
GREAT PRO-BOER GATHERING
Flags of every nation on the globe
barring the banner of England and the
dragon of Chlna^ â were used to decorate
the interior of the hall, while the ar
morial banners of the cantons of
Switzerland lined the galleries.
But few if any public gatherings held
in San Francisco have ever reached
such proportions or been characterized
with such enthusiasm and honesty of
purpose. Judge M. Cooney presided.
He stated that he cheerfully accepted
the honor and the responsibility. He>
mentioned that an honorary president
had been selected. After eulogizing
the man, while keeping the audience
In Ignorance of his Identity, he turned
his face to the rear of the platform,
where hung a big American flag, re
marking, "I will now introduce him
to you." The flag was dropped, and
from behind appeared the grim fea
tures of Oom Paul, painted by the
students of the Hopkins Institute of
Art. Every person In the Temple
"caught on" in an Instant and cheered
to the echo.
At the conclusion of tbÂ« outburst
the following resolutions were read:
Resolved, iiy the citizens of Ban Fran
cisco, in mass-meeting assembled, that we
most heartily Indorse the patriotlo and in
dependent stand taken by the Inhabitants
of the two republics of South Africa in de
fense of their liberties and sacred rights,
and earnestly condemn the British Govern
ment for its unjust, unwarranted and
wicked Dro6ecutlon of the present war
against the sovereign people of said repub
lics; be it further
Resolved, That our active sympathies be,
and they are hereby, extended to the brave
people who are so faithfully and success
fully fighting the battles of their country
against the enemy of liberty, the mother of
oppression and the diplomatic hypocrite of
the nations. *
Resolved That we do now appeal to the
liberty-loving people of the United States,
and to all lovers of liberty everywhere, to
accord all possible assistance to those he
roes and patriots who are now engaged In
driving the Invader from their land, to the
end that an Independent and free United

general of the Transvaal.
The address of. the evening waa made
by Judge Robert Ferral, who kept the
American eagle and the audience
screeching and made the BritlÃh lion
howl with the pain from words that
burned Into his hide. In part he Bald:
I am told that men of all nations are here
to-night, speaking all languagesâ some not
speaking tha English languageâ but we can
all Join In a universal language, a cheer
for the grandest old man of the closing
centuryâ old Oom Paul Kruger. Never
since the dawn of time, has there been a
grander or a more manly struggle for lib
erty than the Boers are making to-day.
Although every man of them may die a*
heroes and patriots, their names will live
as long as liberty and independence are
loved and cherished by men. What would
become of us if therÂ« were not men willing
to die that their country might HveT
England is the "natural born reacher"
of nations. Centuries ago it reached out
and strangled Wales, crushed the llfÂ» and
liberty out of Scotland, crushed life and
libertyâ but, thank Qod, not the hopeâ out
of poor old Ireland, and now aha is reach
ing out for Africa.
It is true, in the providence of Godâ and
I say It before the picture of grand old
Taul Krugerâ it is time to 'call a halt and
say, "Stop your butchery and your plunder
ing, your greed and your conquest." And
I hope In God that these men who are bat
tling now, these men who have so gallantly
cone to the front, father and son and
brother, to battle for truth and right,' for
country and liberty and independenceâ l
hope and trust that the god of battles will
rive them victory.
Miss Sannle Kruger, the niece of Oom
Paul, was given an ovation. She cany
the Transvaal national hymn, and for
an encore "My Country, 'Tls of Thee."
Th. Pinter, who had been addressing
the overflow meeting, elbowed his way
down' the aisle at this time and told
what was happening outside. He told
of some contributions that had been
made, and suggested that the commit
tee would not get angry if there were
Borne more. The hat-passing produced
a Jingle of silver that gladdened every
Boer sympathizer. The collection
amounted to $359 49, and in addition
there were checks from the Iroquoia
Club, Mayor Phelan, Father Crowloy
of the Youths* Directory, J. W.

of Judge Ferral were made by Mayor

GERMAN BANK
LOSES ITS CASE
Interpretation of State
Street Laws.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.â ln the suit of
the German Savings Bank vs. Ramish &
Marsh, Los Angeles contractors, Judge
Fitzgerald handed down a fiat decision In
favor of the defendants. The decision is
of great importance, as It is the first to
determine whether property held under
lien by contractors for taxes for improve
ments can be foreclosed through neglect
or refusal of abutting property owners to
pay the assessment levied.
The plaintiff based his case upon several
points, sweeping In character. Among
other things It was contended that the
sale of the property on the assessment
was made at a time when the tax laws of
the State provided that the property
should be stricken off to the State. Sec
ond, that the Vrooman and bond acts, un
der which the grading was performed, did
not afford an opportunity for hearing by
mortgagees. Third, that the mortgage
Hen was prior In time to, and therefore
paramount and Â«uperior to. the bond lien.
Fourth, that the change of grade act of
March 9. 1893. is unconstitutional, because
it requires an owner to state his damages
before the damages are actually sustained.
Fifth, that the contract between the con
tractors and more than a quarter of the
property owners was fraudulent and in
validated the assessment lien. Sixth, re
quirements of certain sections of the
change of grade act were not complied
with. Seventh, that the assessment is in
valid if it exceeds to any extent the ben
efit accruing to the land by reason of r the
improvement. Eighth, that the notices
were not posted as alleged. Ninth, that
the descriptions are insufficient. Tenth,
that the change of grade act of March 9,
1893. was repealed by the recent amenil
ment to section 6 of article 11 of the State
constitution.

A Verdict of Suicide.
Coroner Hill concluded his Inquest yes
terday upon the body of E. D. Slack of
3435, Twentieth 6treet, who shot and killed
himself last Thursday evening in the Davy
Crockett saloon on Market street.
Harry de Greayer testified that a few
minutes before the shooting, Slack passed
him in front of the saloon and remarked,
"I've lost my Job and I'm going to kill
myself."
He then went Into the saloon and into
a private room, and a few minutes later
the report of. a pistol was heard and
Slack was found lying on the floor with a
bullet wound in his head and the revolver
by his side.
The Jury rendered a verdict of suicide.
FORGED A POLICEMAN'S NAME.
Officer Dan Sylvester Imposed On by
a Clever Penman.
Police Officer Dan Sylvester would like
to find the man who obtained $20 from
Hugo Fritz, a bartender at thÂ« Orpheum
Theater Annex, on an order which pur
ported to have been signed by the guar
dian of the peace. Several days ago a
messenger boy who is commonly known
as "Ikey** visited the Orpheum bar and
handed Fritz an order for $20. which bore
the name of Sylvester. Fritz asked the
boy who had given him the order, and he
promptly answered that he had been In
structed to deliver it by Sylvester, who
was then in a saloon on the water front.
Thinking that the order waa , genuine,
the bartender readily gave the boy the
amount asked for, after telling him to
lose no time in delivering it to Sylvester.
The following day Fritz met the police
man and asked him If he had received the
money. Sylvester at first thought that
the bartender waa Joking, but on being
shown the forged order he almost fainteg.
Since then Sylvester and Detective
"Harry" Reynolds have been searching
for the man who wrote the order, but
without success.
The police believe that the messenger
boy "stood in" with the forger. If the
latter Is captured it is more than likely
that the boy will rlso be arrested.

20PHELAH DECIDES
THAT MAXWELL
MUST GIVE WAY
Fire Commission to Be
Coerced.
J. C. GORMAN FOR SECRETARY
Mayor Phelan's desire to impress upon
the community the fact that he is tho
whole thing in the municipal administra
tion is rapidly becoming a monomania
and not only are his Democratic follow
ers being taught that in the distribution
of the plums he is apt to consult his own
sweet will without regard to their recom
mendations or advice, but the general
public Is beginning to open its eyes to thÂ«
glaring inconsistencies of his official acts.
When Mayor Phelan announced his ap
pointments on 1 the various commissions
provided for in the new charter there
were many heartaches and more or less
talk of broken pledges, but those who
helped to place him in office still clung
blindly to the hope that he would at least
remember his promises and listen to their
claims when the minor places were being
given out. They are now beginning to see
the folly of entertaining such hopes, as
it is dally becoming more apparent that
the Mayor intends to have a finger in fill
ing all the offices under his control, and
he is not particular on whose fingers ho
steps.
The latest Indication of the tendency of
Mayor Phelan to dictate appointments is
the well authenticated report that he is
determined to insist on the right to name
the secretary of the Fire Commission.
All during the recent election, and for tho
few days following, it was generally un
derstood that Secretary George Maxwell
would be retained in this position. There
fore the announcement that Joseph C.
Gorman has been selected by the Mayor
for the place and that the Fire Commis
sioners will be forced to do the bidding
of their on*icial creator and accept him,
is received with a howl of protests by
the friends of the present (secretary.
Gorman was formerly secretary of the
State Board of Examiners, by appoint
ment of Governor Budd, and it is sur
mised that his selection to succeed Max
well is the result of a secret compact en
tered into prior to the nomina
tion and election of Mayor Phe
lan. No reason is . assigned for
dropping Maxwell, and his friends de
clare that he will not retire without a
hard battle. They say he is a faithful
and efficient official, and assert that un
der the new charter he cannot be re
moved unless neglect of duty or incompe
tence is shown.
In reviewing the appointments made by
Mayor Phelan a few days ago The Call
stated that the selections for members of
the i Fire Commission were not all that
could be desired, but expressed the belief
that at least two of the members could
be depended upon to stand between the
department and the political iob-chasers.
Maxwell has a great many friends In the
Fire Department and out of it, and they
are being lined up to make a fight for
him. They admit that Mayor Phelan
may be able to control the votes of the
Commissioners and thus bo in a position
to compel obedience to his will and en
able him to carry out the secret pledges
and compacts entered into before the
campaign. They are hopeful, however,
that two of the Fire Commissioners who
are credited with having opinions of their
pwn will refuse to allow the Mayor to ar-
COSTLY REPORT
RENDERED BY AN
EXPERT ON OIL
Big Money Paid for a
Treatise.
STATE TREASURY HARD HIT.
An inspection of the State payroll, with
a view of bringing to the public gaze the
names of men to whom large salaries
are paid for very little work discloses
pome remarkable facts. Office-holding
has been reduced to a science. Connected
with the various departments and com
missions of the State are many fakers
who fool the Legislature and State of
ficers by the preparation of high-sound
ing reports. The impression is given to
the unenlightened that certain men on the
payroll, who do not seem to be actively
employed, are giving priceless scientific
knowledge to the commonwealth.
The present war in which the Governor
and the State Mineralogist are engaged
directs attention to the State Mining Bu
reau. Vast sums of public money have
been contributed to sustain this institu
tion, but the practical, every-day miners
laugh at the suggestion that mining de
velopment is promoted by the outlay.
Governor Gage recently commissioned
W. L. Watts to make expert examina
tion of the mother lode or the oil regions.
Watts was appointed Held assistant of the
Mining Bureau by J. J. Crawford when
the latter held the position of State Min
eralogist, lie was reappolnted by the
present Â¦ Mineralogist, Mr. Cooper, and. is
therefore on the pay roll as an oil expert.
Something happened at the State Min
ing Bureau a few weeks ago to cause in
quiry as to the whereabouts of Watts. It
was rumored that he was* living near Los
Angeles and drawing down nls salary
with customary regularity. The rumor
was verified by investigation and he was
called upon to make a report of his ob
servations in the field, as he had not re
ported, for two years and a half. At first
he resented the suggestion as an invasion
of his rights as a field assistant. Ha
yielded ultimately and filed a report of
eighty-six typewritten pages. If this re
port is not worth $$000 the State has been
jobbed, because Watts has been paid sal
ary and expenses aggregating that
amount, and the precious document is
the only known result of the outlay.
The Call has not had the opportunity
of inspecting the ore document recently
filed, but is willing to wager that it is
no better than a report made by Watts
to State Mineralogist Crawford on August
1. 1594. A small amount will be wagered
that the present is no better than the
former report and a big sum is laid that
it is no worse.
All information of value in the former
report. could have been obtained for $200.
When one eliminates references to "plio
cene fossils." mlocene rocks, tertiary
strata, . increased metamorphism, fosslll
ferous stratum, concretionary sandstone,
unfossiliferous, sandy formations con
taining immense numbers of ostrea titan
llropectin and tamlosoma, there is very
little remaining in the report to . amuse
or enlighten thn oil man.
The State printing office is constantly
burdened Â¦ with .worthless reports. The
documents are published at State ex
pense and the members of the Legisla
ture readily .vote money; to continue the
expensive farce. Watts, who has attain
ed scientific knowledge of â¢ the modern
methods for. getting on the pay roll, is

PUZZLED OVER
SESSION CALL
Southerners in Doubt
As to the Date.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS A-NGELES. Jan. 6.â Politicians arÂ©
to-night In doubt whether to prepare to go
to Sacramento next week or the week. of
January 16. A few of the Initiated profess
to believe that their Information Is accu
rate that Gage will Issue- his proclamation
January 8. It transpired to-day that Gage
will come to Los A_ngeles within a week.
This Information comes from his Los
Angeles office. His attaches express the
opinion that an extra session will be
called. They have known for some time
that Gage would come south and they as
sert that he comes here for the purpose of
arranging his private affairs that he may
not be disturbed when the extraordinary
session opens. From the mass of opinions
that this fact has. developed the conclu-
Hion is sifted that if January 15 should
pass and no session.be called the reason
will be that the practical politicians will
be unable to deliver any more goods than
on the final day of last year's session.
Private telegrams that were to-day re
ceived from San Francisco saying: that M.
If. do Young will, in the event of an
extra session, be a candidate and that his
name will be regularly presented before
the caucus, has increased the tension. De
Young's friends insist . that he has de
clared that with him it is anything to de
feat Burns and that he- will go before the
people- next year should tfrere be no extra
sesssion.

He Was the Guest of Several Very

The recent marriage of A. A. Moore Jr.
to Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hlnckley resulted
in a pleasant little party yesterday at one

State election Mr. Moore has held the
position of Deputy Attorney General un
der Tirey L. Ford. Soon after his mar
riage It was rumored that he would give
up his growing practice of law and look
after the large realty and financial Inter

out foundation, so he declared yesterday
at the little social function mentioned. â¢
In the early afternoon Attorney Gen

NEW COMMISSIONERS MEET
Secretaries Win Be Selected at
First Regular Meetings.
The new Police and Election Commis
sioners met yesterday at the City Hall
and indulged in informal discussions of
business which they will have before them
after they go regularly into office to-mor
row. The claims and capabilities of dif
ferent candidates who have come up for
the secretaryships of the two commissions
were discussed, but it was resolved to
take no official action until after the first
regular meeting. The new Hoard of Su
peryisor*Â«, or at least a part of it, has
held tevf-ral quiet caucuses during the
past week ana has decided to otter the
chief clerkship to John KuÃsell. the vet
eran clerk of the bo&rd. The second place
will be given to John Kyan. It was
thought at first that Mr. kussell would
not be able to again take up the work of
the department, but to the delight of his
many friends he made his first appear
ance at the hall on Friday and announced

GODCHAUX'S DEPUTIES.
The Recorder-Elect Announces
His Choices for Office.
Recorder - elect Edmond Godchaux

rogate to himself the right to name tho
appointments which they have the au
thority to make.
It is clearly evident that the Mayor has
resolved that no appointments shall be
made without consulting him. In other
words, the Commissioners he has placed
In office are regarded as puppets to ba
manipulated at his pleasure. The rapidly
accumulating evidence to this effect has
created a widespread feeling of disap
pointment and disgust and the alienation
of the friends of Maxwell. If the scheme
to throw him aside is successful. Is but a
prelude of what will follow If Mr. Phe
lan expresses his ambition to become a
municipal dictator to a finish.
Ject to the penalties which are provided
for such a violation. When the Ingleside
course was in operation Corrigan secured
the expulsion of Fred Mulholland from
the track. Mulholland had censured tho
methods which were then making tne
track a by-word and Corrigan lost no
time In taking revenge. Mulholland la
now one of the judges of the California
Jockey Club and Corrigan Insists, with
his customary disregard of the truth,
that the club Is violating one of the rules
of the American Turf Association.
He has decided to retaliate by making
Tanforan a haven for men whose meth
ods have made them objectionable at
Oakland. Several men have been sus
pended, ruled off, warned off or expelled
and Corrigan has said to them: "Come
down to our track. We have a place for
you and you'll be welcome." He finds
that for the purposes of his game men
of shady character are serviceable. In
permitting the men ruled off at Oakland
to operate at Tanforan Corrigan has vio
lated the very laws whose aid he seeks
to provoke a quarrel with the California
Jockey Club.
In one instance he went to Dick Will
iams, who trained for Barney Schreiber,
and who was Indefinitely suspended. Ccr
rigan invited Williams after his suspen
sion to go to Tanforan and train, but the
invitation was emphatically declined,
Williams declaring that he expects to be>
reinstated.
McCloskey. who was ruled off at Oak
land for fraud, supplied another opportu
nity for Corrigan. and Sandy McNaughton
and J. Brown, who were warned off, sup
plied two more examples.
In this way Corrigan is seeking to pro
voice an Issue between Tanforan and thÂ«
California Jockey Club. He has the en
tire support of Tanforan in the scheme,
for the simple reason that he is In him
self the entire concern. The others that
figure in it do so simply aa a set of dum
mies representing Corrigan's will ani
wishes. Affairs in the plot reached a cer
tain climax yesterday, when R. B. Milrcy.
secreary of the California Jockey Clu>>.
had the temerity to visit Tanforan. Ai
soon as Corrigan saw him he pounced
upon him. and in a tirade that was char
acteristically foul unloaded his wrath.
He seemed to think that Mllroy repre-
Ed to notify the police, but before he
could do so his murderers, presum
ably divining his intentions, entered
his shop and shot him to death. Last
night an extra detail of police was
stationed in Chinatown to prevent fur
ther trouble. Detective Ed Gibson,
who Is working on the latest tragedy,
believes he knows the assassins and
Is confident of apprehending them.
An effort was made by the Suey
Sings last evening to cover up their
bloody tracks by throwing the re^on-"
Blbnlty of the murder on the Chinese
Carpenters' Union, of which the vic
tim was a member. A number of Chi
nese gave the information that Wong
Yuen had refused to pay his men the
regulation wages and In consequence
had Incurred the wrath of the union.
The story is given no credence In po
lice circles.
WONG YUEN, a Chinese car
penter, was murdered last
evening in his shop at 2S\a
Waverly place, as the result
of the feud between the Suey Sing and
Hop Sing tongs of rival highbinders.
Shortly before 6 o'clock three Chinese,
who are unknown to the police, visited
the shop of their victim and inquired
if he would do some work for them.
Recognizing them as highbinders
Yuen ordered them to leave his place.
Instantly one of the men drew a re
volver and fired two shots at him.
One of the bullets struck the car
penter In the breast and the other en
tered the stomach and passed through
his body^ The wounded Chinaman
staggered Into a small room which he
used as a sleeping apartment, and
after closing the door behind him sank
into a chair and died almost instantly.
The shooting attracted the attention
of Policeman Carr, who was only a
short distance away, and he lost no
time in reaching the scene. Failing to
open the door of the room into which
the wounded Chinese had staggered,
Carr, with the assistance of another
officer, forced an entrance. Seated in
a dilapidated chair was the dead Yuen.
Three Chinese were found In the base
ment in which the carpenter had his
shop and they were taken into cus
tody. They will be held pending fur
ther investigation, although it is not
believed they had anything to do with
the shooting.
The murder of Yuen Is the outcome
of the bitter feud that at present ex
ists between the rival highbinder
tongs. Already several Chinese have
fallen victims to the deadly bullets of
the hired assassins of both tongs and
more are likely to follow. Yuen be
longed to the Suei* Sing Ton? and was
considered an Inoffensive 'Ohinaman
by the police. It Is supposed that he
incurred the enmity of the rival tongs
and a price was placed on his head.
A short time before he was mur
dered he told a friend that he knew
he was doomed, as he had seen sev
eral notorious highbinders hanging
about his shop, evidently bent on add
ing to their bloody records. He intend-
R. B. MILROY.
<:Â¦ 3 DWARD CORRIGAN has added
â 3 another Incident to the many
which have marked his offensive
, > .j) career on this coast. He created
a disgraceful scene yesterday at
Tanforan Park and last night those who
had been witnesses of his outrageous aa
sault upon an unoffending citizen were
speculating on what the outcome will bÂ«.
Corrigran Irad taken his customary means
of working out his spite upon one who,
he thinks, represents the reputable ele
ments which are determined to suppress
him.
The affair of yesterday had Its origin in
the rejection of Corrigan's entries by the
California Jockey Club. The methods of
the Chicago gambler had become so no
toriously offensive that the Oakland peo
ple realized that they must sacrifice the
good opinion of decent sportsmen if they
continued even te tolerate Corrigan. He
had been repudiated by reputable horse
men In other parts of the country and
the Oakland people decided to save their
own reputations by refusing to be asso
ciated with him. They therefore declined
to accept his entries, thus forcing him
to confine his energies to Tanforan.
He Immediately began to scheme for
revenge. The rejection of his entries was
the climax in a series of rebukes which
were quickly driving him out of the sport
upon which he has brought discredit. He
decided, therefore, to force Jf possible a
quarrel with the officials of the California
Jockey Club and thus create some sort
of an Issue before the American Turf
Association. In this association Corrigan
has PtilJ some standing through gross
misrepresentations in reference to the
Western Turf Association. It has been
falsely claimed that Corrigan has no
official connection with Tanforan. As a
matter of fact, demonstrated yesterday
by his own boast, he Is the absorbing,
controlling spirit of Tanforan. dictating
the policy of the concern as he pleases.
In his efforts to provoke a quarrel with
the California Jockey Club Corrigan
however, has overreached himself. He
has deliberately violated the laws of the
American Turf Association and is sub-

Appointmentsâ Board of Public Works

Cn ra ATOR PHEL.AN yesterday
//yJ/\ morning apj>^ared before the
II \/ \\ Board of Health accompanied
M /tk & b >' a police officer and made
the startli::? announcement
that he had ccme to put a stop to. any
j-^an that body might have to change the
locks on the doors and do other thing's
calculated to keep the charter board cut
when it comes to take Its seat on Monday
morning:. Despite the protests of the
members of the board, the Mayor installed
his officer Jn charge of the office. In ex
cuse of his conduct he explained that he
understood that the beard proposed con
testing the rip in cf the new board to of
fice ar.d proposed to lock the doors against
It. and he did not propose to have any
thing of the sort done.
Dr. Coffey, uho was present, -was high
ly ind'gr.ant. and informed Mayor Phelan
that he considered such conduct a refec
tion upon his professional standing. Dr.
Juiwlor, the Health Officer, denied cny
intention of changing the locks, and also
txpret-st^i his indignation at such a re-j
flection upon his professional character.
JM Niles. also connected with the board,
Â¦was as emphatic in his exijres^ions, and
the Mayor finally called the yhiy off an 4
discharged the officer.
Dr. Lawlor later said that he did not
Â£> ::y that the board intended to hold of
Â£ce until the Supreme Court should de
tide ii^ainet it, but at the tame time he
Â«aid that the doors would r.ct be barri
caded nor the locks changed. "We pro
pose to ilghi this matter out on legal
grounds," caid Dr. Lawlor, "and we are
fuing to hold iiO one up. We consider
that the courts will offer us all the pro
tection we need, and we will not resort to
hoodlum methods to maintain ourselves,
ilayor Phelan knows that as well as we
co, and his play this afternoon was sim
!.:>â¢ for totoritty, and for nothing else,"
There was not a quorum present at the
morning meeting, but there was in the
tfternooa. and the whole question was
referred to the Attorney General.
E<i I. Shcehan, the present Tax Collect
cr, jntence to hold his c2ice against his
successor if he has to use an arsenal to
do it. withstanding that the legal as-.
; ect of his case is In the hands of the
courts, he yesterday barricaded the doors
to hit office with 2jlS timbers and with all
of the counters and furniture at his com
mand. Tax Collector-elect Scott was
made aware of Ehec-han's movements, and
intends storming the office on Monday
rooming with his entire force.
The pew Board of Kducation caucused
yesterday atternoon and listened to the
protest of Superintendent Webster against
the fixing cf deputies' salaries at a lower
Jigure thfcn J250 per month. Mr. Webster
fot no satisfaction. Mrs. Kincaid said
that If Webster proposed to appoint a
ceputy lik.; L. A. Jordan she would stand
tor no more than 515u per month. James
J-jenman taid the same thing about W. A.
Kingsbury. Both agreed that if Webeter
should appoint deputies wnoin they con
sidered fct they would vote for the higher
caiary.
The Commissioners of Public Works
fceid an informal meeting in the afternoon
and decided to elect J. Leo Parks aa sec
retary when they come together !n their
f.rst regular rneetir.g on Monday morning.
Ex-Cour:ty Clerk. John Brown was chesen
to fill the tsaroe office with the incoming
Board of Health. He will succeed Ed
ward Carroll, the present secretary.
After the meetings the members of the
Xiuraerous commissions were summoned to

formed of his Honor's desires regarding
patronage. It is understood that Andrew
Donovan is 6lated for the Superintendence

HEALTH BOARD STATUS.
The Attorney General Will Be
Requested to Define It.
PAt a ppecial meeting of the Board of
Fealth last r.ight It was decided to re
quest the Attorney General to advise the
board an to its rights regarding the ap-
pointmerit of a new board by Mayor Phe
lan. and also to determine its legal status.
I>r. Barbat presided 8t the meeting, with
Drs. Coffey and Payne, Health Onicer
I-awlor and Secretary' Carroll present. The
lioard wlll_ meet to-morrow morning at 11
o'clock to receive the opinion of the At
torney General and will proceed In the
case as he recommends.
Mayor Phelan had promised to attend,
but he did not appear until lonp aXter the
meeting had adjourned, but as the mem
bers had remained to discuss the different
phaws of the affair he called the meeting
to order for the purpose of learning their
Intention^..
The Mayor stated that he had been in
formed that the board had determined to
resist the assumption of office by the new
board, and hÂ« rÂ»\ad a long legal document
prepared by his attorney, Daniel Murphy,
tho wing that the charter bad ample au-
thoiitv to provide for a new Board of
Health.
"The charter was adopted in good
faith." said his Honor, "and the people
expect to see it carried out in full force.
I can see no good reason why the mem
bers of this board should resist that
authority. I regard this as a purely
municipal affair and the charter was
mainly intended to take away former pre
rogatives exercised by the State. To the
contention that amendment S^j of the con
stitution did not confer on the Freehold
ers the right. to provide for a new Board
of Health, I will say that neither did it
provide for a Fire Commission or a Park
Commission, and yet no question has been
raised about those appointments. I would
like to know what you gentlemen are go
ing to do?"
Dr. Payne replied that on the advice of
Attorney Hepgerty It had been decided
to ask for the opinion of the Attorney
General as to the hoard's legal standing
and to abide by it.
"None of the members of the board,"
Paid Dr. Payne, "are desirous of contest
ing: the offlpe tor the purpose of holding
on. but there Is a legal doubt to be set
tled, and should it be against us we will
retire gracefully."
Attorney Copeland of Lios Angeles, who
has been retained by the employes of the
board to defend their interests, stated
that he considered the Board of Health
purely a State commission. The provision
of the l*os Angeles charter relating to the
appointments of Police Judges had been
overruled by the Supreme Court because
it did not specifically provide for them. The
Los Angeles charter is Eimilar to that of
San Francisco, because neither had been
signed by the Governor.
After a long discussion, the Mayor, ad
dressing the members of the board, said
Just before the meeting adjourned, "Gen
tlemen. If you obstruct the charter you
do so on your own responsibility "
Referring to the sending of ' Policeman
Harry Hook in the morning to see that
the locks on the office doors were not
changed the Mayor said that he had heard
that Fuch was the Intention, but on being
apprised by Dr. Coffey that it was not
true he had withdrawn the officer. Health
Officer Lawlor explained the rumor by
sayiDg that he had procured a locksmith
to change the tumbler in one of the locks
on the door of the statistician's office In
order to keep Expert Griffin out. The lat
ter possesses a duplicate key and had
6ent two kalsomlners to whitewash the
waJls without showing the proper author
ity from the Mayor, who appointed him.
CIVIL SERVICE TESTS.

JUDGE SMITH TO
TRY RICHARDSON
AND ROSENBERG
Oakland Magistrate in
Indignant Mood.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, Jan. 6.
Upon second thought Police Judge Mor
timer Smith of Oakland haa decided that
his early breakfast at the New Postofflce
restaurant with those upon whom he
would afterward be required to pass In
Judgment Is no Joke.
In truth, his Honor Is In Irate mood, and
being moved mightily by his indignation
Is sending forth some verbal shoulder
sttikers. Woe to the "crap gamester"
who in future Is fated to stand before the
bar of Police Judge Smith's court. In the
language of the street, he will by his own
admission "do things to them." And yet
Joe Rosenberg will have to stand there
next Tuesday, and yet again Sig Richard
son on Thursday.
There will be no booths, no partitions,
no wine â not even a crust. The subject
of crap games will undoubtedly be dis
cussed In some form or other, but any
consolation to be offered Is so far an un
known quantity.
"I Intend to try the rest of these men
charged with breaking the law by being
connected with Â» banKing game," assev
erated the Judge, "and lr the evidence Is
of the same nature as In the case of Dea
con they will without doubt be convicted.
My opinion in this matter Is that the
police were warranted In making the ar
rests."
When asked If he believed that the fact
of Joe Rosenberg and Slg Richardson en
tering the doorway of the restaurant as
he and Attorney Pulelfer were taking
their seats in a booth did not tend to
show they had followed him there. Judge
Smith declined to answer. Nor would he
deny that he believed such a thing pos
sible; but later furnished his opinion in
the matter In a roundabout but unmistak
able manner.
"I will state thl3 for publication, he
declared. "If there was a 'steer'â to use
the language already accredited to me â
Mr. Pulclfer had no hand in it. Further
more, those who did have failed to gain
anything by It. either at the time or with
regard to my future course of procedure.
It is true that Rosenberg and Richardson
did not enter the restaurant until Harry
and I were taking our seats In a booth."
Chief of Police Hodgklns states it as
his opinion that the evidence against
Deacon not only proved conclusively that
"craps" were being thrown in the rear of
Rosenberg's saloon on the night of De
cember 17 last, but that the game was
conducted on banking principles. He says
that the same evidence Introduced in the
case of Deacon will hold good In the cases
of those yet to stand trial. Judge Smith
himself admits that a"crap" game In
which there are several players Is neces
sarily a banking game, and as such comes
within the province of the law.
In view of the commonly admitted Im
propriety of Jud?e Smith's taking supper
wltn the men who would afterward have
to be tried In his court, the cases of the
other arrested men are being watched
keenly by the general public, and the trial
of Rosenberg next Tuesday will undoubt
edly call forth a large attendance In court.
MISSION FEDERATED
CLUB'S NEW OFFICERS
At a meeting of the Mission Federated
Improvement Clubs held last night at
Sunnyslde Hall, the following oflcers
were elected for the ensuing six month:
A. 3. Lillie. president; Gustave Schnee.
vice president; Joseph P. Tuohey, aecre
tarj'r and W. A. Hicks, treasurer. The
former president. Gus Stader. declined the
nomination In consequence of having im
portant business to attend to. He receiv
ed a vote of thanks for the service ren
dered the federation during the past year.
Dr. E. W. Torello spoke of the deplor
able condition of the Mission road, so
called, which Is now a continuation of
Mission street. He said the thoroughfare
Is a disgrace to the municipality and he
urged on the new officers of the associa
tion the necessity of inviting the Mayor
and the new Board of Public Works to
visit the street and see what can be done
to make It at least passable for teams.
His remarks were Indorsed by the club
and the new officers promised to comply
with his suggestions.
Ex-President Stader stated that, on be
half of .the Mission Federated Clubs, a
heroic statue of George Washington
would be presented to Glen Park and that
the municipal officers would be invited
to be present on February 22. at which
time the statue would be unveiled. <

their head 3 dubiously and remarked tnnt

Milroy fortunately escaped without bcrf-
Ily Injury. The fact that he was unarmed
explains also, perhaps, why the Corrigan
hide is stlU Intact. The lncidem remain?-!
for the afternoon, however, the absorbing
topic of discussion. Corrigan was en his
mettle and blurted out beasts tha: ma*
interfere with his plans. He shouted that
he would remain In California racing as
long as he pleased. Ke urged his frlerd*
to hasten away and buy Inglesirte stick.

WTTTRTIAS, The Legrlslature of ITew York believing that "The
stronger the mothers, the Btrongir the race," enacted a law
a ie-csr years ago that "Merchants provide Â»y.ts for their lady clerks
ia all the stcrÂ«s and shops wherever possible." Therefore be It
Resolved, That the Mothers' Union of Golden Gate kindly re
qnest the co-operation of the Oakland Club and other societies to
petition the Oakland merchants to provide seats for the lady clerks
in all the stores and shops where they have not provided them.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call. 906 Broadway. Jan. Â«.
f_, .jTTTS resolution, adopted at a meeting of the Mothers' Union of Golden
Gate, opens a very Important discussion that Is bound to have full
e-srir.gr in this State. It may even mean the beplntln? cf agitation for
11 legislation In California similar to that adopted In New Tork.
The Mothers' Union of Golden Gate is an organization of earaeÂ«t
worsen who hold meetings at homes and discuss matters of benefit to the
â¢ex. the family ar.d mothers In general. Their organization, which has been
very Quietly pursuing its work in the newly annexed district of Oakland,
has suddenly sprung into prominence over the ftand that they nave taken
tipcn this point.
The meeting at which this resolution waa adopted was held at the resi
dence cf Mrs. Phebe Mincher In Golden Gate, and the matter waa called up
by that lady. It provoked a general discussion, which had but one direction.
It â¢was in favcr of trying to secure conveniences for the female attendants In
<iry goods stores in the interest cf health and locg life. It wu decided to try
and start the reform fey women themselves, without appeal to the 9t#.tÂ« Leg
islature, which may net rr^t for another year.
It was said ty several of the women of the union that If the women of
the State would refuse to patronize stores that did not provide Beats for their
employes a.l cf tne stores of the State would immediately act without
any legislation.
The resolution was then drawn up and adopted, and the clubs of Oakland
will be aske-i to co-operate In this reform that was begun at Golden Gate.
The following rÂ£eers w<?re then elected: President, Mrs. W. lUonan:
vice president. Mrs. P. Cahiil; secretary. Mrs. S. W. Strlte; treasurer, Mrs.

FIRE THAT HAS
BEWILDERED THE
POLICE OFFICERS
Ingalls' Residence To
tally Destroyed.
OAKXiAND.' Jan. 6.â The residence of
Henry A. Ingalls at the corner of Sixty
first and Ruby Â¦treets was totally de
stroyed by fire last night, and the poltce
and fire departments are now endeavoring
to learn whether or not the blaze was of
incendiary origin. Nobody knows how It
started and a streetcar motorman whose
name cannot be ascertained declared that
he saw two men- running away from the
house and It burst into fi&mea. No person
was in the structure at the time the fire
occurred excepting a student by the name
of Atchison. who roomed there. He waa
asleep at the. time and barely escaped
with his life,
Mr. Ingalla and his family were visiting
the parents of hla wife at the time and
were just returning home when they saw
that the house waa burning. The Fire
Department was telephoned to. but owing
to some misunderstanding as to whether
or not the place was within the city limits
no response was made. Chief Ball was tn
bed at the time and is now trying to as
certain where the negligence lies. The
property was valued at $2500 and waa in
sured for JISOO.
WILL REFORM
THE CRIMINALS
OF CALIFORNIA
Home Created for
Ex-Convicts.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
SOS Broadway, Jars. 6.
An effort Is to be made In Oakland for
the systematic redemption of the ex-con
victs of California. Ever since the State
was admitted to the Union the prisoners
discharged from the penal institutes have
been left to battle for life with nothing
but a paltry Jo, a suit of cheap clothing
and a stigma upon their names. All this
Is now to be changed, and they are to be
given a fair chance to rehabilitate them
selves among men. if they desire to reform
and traverse the straight and narrow
path.
The man who will endeavor to create
the wholesale metamorphosis In habitual
evil-doers is Chaplain J. Moore, an expert
crtminolcglst from the East. He has
spent the past ten years in efforts" to
reform the lawbreakers of Canada and
Massachusetts, and now declares his In
tention to devote the balance of his life
to working reformations among the bad
element of the Pacific Coast. So favor
able have been the recommendations fur
nished by him that he had no difficulty in
enlisting aid In behalf of his project. Al
though he has been in Oakland but a
week, he has already secured the neces
sary financial support to place the scheme
on a working basis, and to-morrow he will
make his nrst visit to San Quentin in
quest of recruits for the ranks of honesty.
Chaplain Mocre has secured the spactoua
residence at 1229 Union street and will
use that as a refuge for the men who
want to eschew their evil ways. They will
be placed in immediate contact with all
the refinements of life and every induce
ment will be held out for them to reform.
Every man will be provided with work of
a temporary nature at which he can earn
some money and kept there until perma
nent and better employment can be se
cured for him.
"We are now negotiating for the lease
of a farm In Frultvale." said Chaplain
Moore, "and I think that the deal will be
closed next week. The place at 1229 Union
street will then be used as a receiving
station and ex-prisoners will be kept here
until we can place them in outside posi
tions or else send them to the farm until
they are located elsewhere. They will be
given all the comforts of a home and will
be made to appreciate In every way the
advantages of decent and honest living.
All criminals are not beyond redemption
and many of them when given a chance
will gladly forsake their bad ways and
become reputable citizens. They need
moral and nnancial aid. however, and we
propose to give It to them."
The scheme is backed by Rev. Dr. Coyle.
Rev. Dr. Brown and a number of other
ecclesiastics. It Is the Intention to enlist
support from all quarters and no religion
of any particular denomination will be
recognized in the management of the or
ganization.

Benefit for Madame Fabbrl.
Madame Fabbri-Mueller, the prominent
artiste and teacher, will soon be given a
substantial benefit by her many' friends.
A short time ago Madame Fabbrl. in re
sponse to earnest solicitation, undertook
to give a German theatrical season. At
great expense and labor the project was
got under way when the dl*astrmiÂ«
Bush-street Theater fire ruined MadaÂ°m2
FabbiTs well laid plans, and she found
herself unable to meet the obligations In
curred in her efforts to stage the season's
plays. Many of the most prominent citi
zens of. the city have signified their will
ingness to assist In giving the benefit
and without doubt it win be a success
both socially and financially.
De Pachmann's final concert was some
thing of a vindication and served to atone
for the deficiencies of his penultimate ef
fort. It waa an exposition of De Pach
mann at his bestâ the expression of a
happy mood and his playing was delight
ful from the beginning of the programme
until Its end. Yet De Pachmann has not
spell; he does not appeal to one though
many channels of esthetic appreciation.
His temperament Is so Intimate of certain
lighter compositions that he dowers them
with a charm that ia Irresistible; the deft
ness of his touch, his display of fancy
are winning Qualities, but judging htm
etrlctly he Is unorthodox and irreverentlal
beyond bounds. He Is too much the
emendator and too little the purist, for
which sinsâ and sins they are In spite of
lreffectualness must exclude him from
the front rank in the perspective of plan-
Ism.
The most notable Item in the Chopin
programme yesterday afternoon were the
Scherzo Op. 31. Etude No. 11, Op. 10. and
the B flat Major Mazurka. Op. 7, which
latter he played In a manner quite differ
ent from his first rendering of the compo
sition at a former recital. The etude was
given with not merely a high order of
skill but his reading was marked by a
superior singing tone and glissande. The
echerzo was rich In color and description
and the waltz which he gave for an en
core was eminently tasteful.

OVER SEVENTY
AND JEALOUS
OF HIS WIFE
Says She Wants to GÂ«J a
Younger Man in His
Stead.
OAKLAND. Jan. 6. â Seventy - seven
year-old James Shields of San Leandro
declared that his aged wife has become
estranged from him, and says that her
affections have been alienated by a
younger and a handsomer man. This
Idea Is declared to be a delusion, and as
a result the jealous old fellow ha 3 beÂ»n
charged with Insanity. He is now locked
up in the Insane ward of the Receiving
Hospital and his mental condition will
be legally determined next week.
The aged and wmte-halred victim of
the green-eyed monster was arrested at
the Instance of his wife thla morning, on
a charge of threatening her life. The
prisoner talked so Incoherently at the ex
amination that Justice Quinn considered
him demented and ordered him taken to
the hospital. He declares that hl3 mind
Is not unbalanced, and says that his wife
wants to get rid of him.
"I have frequently been locked out by
my wife," said Shields, "and waa com
pelled to sleep in the basement. I am
old and feeble and I think she wants to
get rid of me and get a "younger hus
band."
The couple have been married for near
ly a quarter of a century. They have
been on bad terms with each other for
some time.
official career in the past has always been
above reproach, and his deeds highly
recommend him aa a successor to him
self. When the name of another was given
on Friday to Dr. Cole for his sanction,
the Coroner-elect refused to accept It. and
deferred the appointment until yesterday,
when he finally succeeded ia making
Flanagan his messenger.

8 15New York Stock Market.
SUtor TORK.Ja.n. Iâ The stock market suf
fÂ»-re<2 to-day from a continuation of the liquida
tion for Berlin account. The volume of this
selling in- .New York was not formidable, but
the Ber.tim*r.tal effect of it was decisive la
driving prices downward throughout the list
Â«nd discouraging buylns; of stocks. The
further tharp decline In interest rates In Eer-
J'.n fend London precluded the explanation of
snoney stringency to account for the selling
and made It appear that its motl\-e was politi
cal. The friction b*twÂ«-en Great Britain
and G^rrrAny over the seizure of the
mail steamers Â»es not left alone as
an 'explanation, the reported moveracnts of
Ru^ian troor* toward the frontiers of
AfÂ»fhar.istan arousing the apprehension of
further â¢mbarraEsr:ents for Great IJritaln. A
leading authority on the sterling market re
corded his opinion that, as long s.s the Trans
vaal war continued, gold would continue to
%o out from New York. The Hoard of Trade' s
return* of Great Entain's foreign trade for De
cember, ehowlng a dÂ«xj<. a se Of over 523,000 000 In
imports and an increa?- of 55.300,C0U in exports,
taken in connertloh Mth the heavy selling of
sfcurlrles in New T'/rJc for London acwuat.
grjfs tcÂ» fxplain Lord' ns continued control over
the: ictf-rnatlonal ciiangea and ability to draw
grtLA at wiil.- The liKhtnes* of the outward
movement of cotton from this country also
k^eps up the rate of sterling exchange. While
the selllnc for foreign account was beir,s exe
cuted there was no disposition to kÂ»-ep above
the London parity and presxure against some
leading Industrials, enpecitLliy Sugar, was
â¢d4#?Â«j. Â¦;-.*'â¢?'
With the e*Â«satlon of the London selling and
the appearance of toe tank statement there
â¢was an improvement la sentiment. Lof^s
were partly recovered and the closing w a * firm
on a K<~joi volume of business. 'fht- fact that
.thÂ» eurrlu* reserve was malntainÂ«-<1 and even
?lightly Increased. In the facÂ« of the gold ex
port movement and a loan expansion of $4,iC7 -
400, aSforded much encouragement over the do
mestic taoney ettuatlcn. The stock market
mo^ed in aa Irregular manner all week ard
thÂ« . -motives of the operations have not be*a
fey any means clear. The confusion !Â« large
ly due to the fact that professional creators
mere clc*lnic up contracts to- -which they had
committed themÂ«*!\eg in expectation of the
*'eek'.s events. Such a movement now usually
tends to nullify the' influence of the actual
?vent xvhea. it occur*. Thus. onÂ» of the
rules In Ptock Exchange speculation is u> bur
In anticipation cf the early January" demand
caused by released dividends and interest
money e^klng Investment. Latt week's
etrernrth In .-Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ ::f was due very largely to
this anticipaiwy buying and the enroilary of
this buying wrK>id be celling to take profits this
week, when thu dividend money began to be
<Hsbur*ed. But while or.c F,et of professional
speculators Is seeking to profit by the buying
cf what Wall street regards as 1 the outeide
fiubllc, there is always another Â»et aiming to
make profit but of the first set -themselves.
This week's events prove that very heavy lines
â¢of fchort contracts v.ere put out last wrek. on
the theory that anticipatory demands Tor stocks
would prove to have outrun the real demand
this week and th* attempt* to realise would
fcreak the market and offer opportunity to cover
Â«t a profit. This element has on their side
the :-n- _::Â¦.Â«Â¦:.? that the recovery In prices from
the level of the December panic had already
"outrun the usual rebound after such disturb
ance and that a reaction was due from the
Â»-.â¢:Â» of stock bought In the panic. The short
sellers arsrued, Â»!ko. that the money market
would not show linr&ediaxe relief aXter January
1 and that the return of disbursements to the
market fe in be retarded. Such speculative
Â¦commitments must be taken into account to
explain the apparent contradiction* In price
movements on new developments. The event
jMtjvt-d that the shorts miscalculated the extent
of the new investment demand and the relief
alne*<!y 1 rr-.r i~i to the money market by last
month' Â« drastic liquidations. Their operations
w#r* moonl)* in the mercurial Industrial special
*lÂ«a, oot*Wy Sugar, and the demand to cover
tlxirt* t-.AK caused some excited advances and
It-verish llu-rtuations this week in that depart
ment of tb* '.ist. In the railroad list for the
most part changes were small, thourh -business
Â»Â»â¢ active a.n.l well distributed. There *as
considerable selling to uJce profit by last
week's professional buyers and there was a
steady stream of liquidation for foreign ac
count until the latter part of the weÂ«-k.
This was sttributed to Berlin account and
was not ful!y explained. The Berlin raoaey

gency sufficient to force large liquidation, and
alarming rumors of political complications be
tÂ»Â«n Great Britain and Germany were depre

fcr securities proved sufficient to absorb of
ferings and sustain the level of prices. The
trunk lice group was notably strong, led by
New York Central. Speculative sentiment is
not very clearly formulated as to the prospect
for values. Investment consideration* rule for
the most part, and buying orders of this char
acter come in on any reaction and serve aa
a suriK-rt. On any considerable advance la
pricte they show a falling off. The high prices
ruling throughout the Industrial and commer
cial world cause ecrne questioning In Wall
street, where "the recent sharp leeson from
the coneequettcts of price inflation has been
taken to fceart. The growth of the proportions
of operating expenses of railroads, by reason
of high-priced material. In the monthly returns
published are impressive. The effects to eneue
from the advances in railroad rates now going
into force on the volume of railroad traffic
will be keenly studied in the light of complaints
by shipping â¢ Interests. The well-nlled order
books in the departments of the iron Industry
give confidence la the existence of continued
prosperous conditions, but the future demon
stration cf the possibility of profitable con
sumption of high-priced primary products is
awaitc-d as an index of the duration of the pe

CHICAGO. Jan. 6.â May wheat opened at
CS?4Â©S9c. a shade over yesterday's close, the
Steadiness, which was lost almost Immediately,
being accounted for by unseasonably moist
weather in the Middle West and the fact that
the Liverpool decline' was less than the loss
here yesterday. Longs, however, discouraged
by the poor export business and the large
stocks, particularly In the Northwest, began
selling at the opening and kept It up through
out the session, with their ranks reinforced by
most of the scalping fraternity. The buying
was nearly all.aisrainst puts. Dullness charac

Steamer Movements.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6. â The Financier cays:
The New York banks continue to gain slowly
In cash holdings and surplus reserves, despite
the drain made upon them In the way of gold
exports. The Clearing-house institutions report
at the end of the week Just ended $539,650 cash
above the amount held at the opening of the
year, the surplus reserve standing at $11,757.
725. The expansion for the six days endlnic
Saturday Is of more than ordinary interest,
since it was made in the face of an Increase of
nearly $3,000,000 of deposits, which, of course,
tied up about $2,250,000 In additional reserve
requirements. ThÂ« gain in cash was $2,516,200.
of which the greater part was in the form
of legal tenders, due to receipts from the in
terior. Loans are $4,107,600 higher. The annual
dividend disbursements at this center have
duutitless affected the statement, and a detailed
analysis shows that there have been some un
usually heavy changes in the totals of larcer
banks, but viewed in all lights the exhibit
Is to be considered very satisfactory- The in
terior movement In particular la assuming
larger prorxjrttons than had been expected.
During January of last year the banks gained
weekly something like $7,000,000 In cash, the
surplus reserve rising between the opening and
the cloee of the month about $20,000,000. The
gain so far this year has been proportionately
heavy, but the exports of guld of course oper
ate to keep the excess cash at a low figure.
Still the banks are moro than holding their
own ar.d are demonstrating an element of
strength which must bÂ« looked upon as gratify
ing.. â¢ Under the circumstances the outlook fa
vors a rate for funds not materially different
Â¦from that now prevailing. How long exports
are to continue Is an uncertain problem, but
as conditions governing the outflow of gold
are entirely favorable to the United States,
both In inception and results accruing, the in
cident of exports Is not viewed with any de
gree of apprehension. Present operations are
In the nature of loans to Eurose. If the re
turn statement Is made In the form of an
American security the United .States has only
added to Its wealth and canceled a certain
Percentage of yearly interest now remitted
abroad.
London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was heavy renewal to-day of the Berlin
liquidation, accompanied by political rumors
In connection with the seizure of German ves
sels bound for Delagoa Bay and the Russian
movement of troops In Afghanistan. ,
Nothing authentic was given out. Americans
suffered most, but other Continental centers
sold Epfciaities. The London market was dead,
simply allowing foreign sales to depress prices.
The Bank of England bought Â£150.0n0 gold In
eagles and XII.OOJ in German coin. Money was
superabundant and bills were Idle.
The Board of Trade returns for December
show import* down 10.2, but an Increase for
the year of 3.L Exports for the month are up
2 and for the year Increased Â».4, the latter
figure excluding- shipbuilding.

THE SOLDIER FOOTPAD.
Frank Moody Instructed and Ar
raigned in Judge Conlan's Court
and the Case Continued.
Frank Moody, the soldier who attempt
ed to murder and rob Martin Van Haar
len, a dry goods merchant on Mission
street, near Tenth, Friday night, appear
ed before Judge Conlan yesterday morn
ing on charges of assault to rob and as
sault to murder. He was not represented
by counsel, and after being instructed and
arraigned the Judge continued the cases
till Tuesday, as Moody said his father,
who was a wealthy man in Texas, would
by that time arrange to have a suitable
attorney to defend him.
\an Haarlen has not been inconven
ienced by the gunshot wound in his back,
the bullet having only grazed his skin.
He saw Moody in the City Prison yes
terday and at once identified him. The
two vaquerosâ F. P. Tyrrell. 135 Cort
land avenue, and John McAndrews of
Lakeview, Or.â who rode after Moody and
captured him also identified him ln the
prison. Tyrrell reached Moody first and,
jumping off his horse, knocked him down
by a well-directed blow on the face with
his fist. Moody was defiant and declared
that he had a big pull in Texas that
would get him out of his trouble.
Moody, when seen in the prison yester
day, said he felt too dazed to realize
whether he had done anything or not.
He said he had been discharged from the
Twenty-third Infantry in Manila and re
turned on the transport Tartar. He went

TTB.ED CHIEF.
Ex-ShrriS "Whelan has announced nlm-
FPif a candidate for Chief of Police. He
1p making a strong fight for the place
and is hopeful of success. It is expected
that when the new Police CommiFFion
meets next Monday there will be at least
a ball dozen candidates ln the field. Whe
lan has been prominently identified with
the Democratic party for some time, and
fin account of his friendly associations
with Mayor Phelan he expects to cap
ture the plum. He is also a warm friend
of Police Commissioner Bigpy.
In cas=e Lleutenajit Esola secures the
appointment, ex-Chief Lees has deter
mined not to turn the office over to him.
He 140 announced himself yesterday ln
the presence of several reporters. LeeÂ«
maintains that under section 1, Chapter
VII, of thÂ© charter, Esola la barred from
acting as Chief of Police.
"Under no circumstances will I surren
der my office to Esola." he remarked
when discussing the matter. "If the new
Commissioners see fit to appoint him I
intend to continue Just as I have been
doing ln thÂ© past, and will take no notice
of him. I. however, seriously doubt if
the new board will appoint Esola."
Lees' declaration that he will not eur
render his office to Esola in case the Com
missioners select him to preside ovt^r the
destinies of the Police Department
caused considerable merriment about the
City Hall. With his retirement, which
was officially announced the other day.

TEACHERS ARE DIVIDED
AGAINST THEMSELVES
THOMAS' BLACKBOARD BILL IS
CAUSING TROUBLE.
Injunction Taken TJp by Judge Mur
aaky and the Fate of the Collat
eral Inheritance Tax Fund
Is in Doubt.
Teachers In the local department are di
vided against themselves, and this prom
ises to complicate matters during the
hearing of the suit brought by J. M.
Thomas, a blackboard maker with a claim
for $520, against Auditor Wells and all
teachers and Janitors to tie up the $70,000
which wfll come into the school fund from
the collateral Inheritance tax next week.
Yesterday morning Attorney Brown
etone. who represents the plaintiff, ap
peared in Judge Murasky's court on short
notice for the purpose of showing ceus*
why the temporary injunction restraining
the Auditor from breaking Into the $70 O<JO
should not be dissolved. Attorney Olnev
who represented the teachers' litigating
committee, of which Colonel Murphy Is
the chairman, before the case was ba'relv
opened said that he believed that Brown
stone was in court as a representative of
Attorney Frank Powers, and that the
present action was a subterfuge under
which other merchant creditors were
working for the purpose of getting hold
of some of the $70,000 by side-stepping de
vices. Mr. Powers was in court as a spec
tator, and he immediately went to Brown
stone's defense. Mr. Powers said that he
regretted that an apparent spirit of vin
dlctiveness had caused counsel to cast a
reflection upon either the ability or the
integrity of Mr Brownstone. counsel for
the plaintiff "It is true." said Powers,
that the suit was brought to me. but ow
ing to my relation to other interested par
ties I could not conscientiously handle the
case, and advised that it be taken to Mr
Brownstone, in whose ability I have full
confldenoe." Continuing. Mr. Powers said
that he had been informed that the so
called teachers' committee had no rip'ht
to enter into an agreement with the mer
chant creditors providing that all moneys
In the school fund during the last half of
iÂ»JB in excess of the usual expenditures
â¢hould be divided proportionately among
the claimants, and he had found that a
majority of the teachers refused to be
bound by such an agreement.
When Powers left the court Colonel
?? I V/ P ?? r fo Â»o w e* him to the corridor and
told him that he had no right to make
thÂ© remark that the litigating committee
did not represent all of the teacherÃ. "I
have $100 here." said Powers, "which I
vi ill forfeit if you can show authorization
from over 250 of the 1200 odd teachers."
Colonel Murphy retired into the court
and then, on motion of Mr. Brownstone
the caee went over till Monday In order
that affidavits bearing on the issues in
volved might be obtained.

HURRY-UP ORDER
FOLLOWED BY DELAY
GUARD DISGUSTED WITH SLOW
METHODS AT SACRAMENTO.
Oaths of Soldiers That Have Gone
Astrayâ The Slow Office Gets a
Pointer About Surgeons.
If there is a demoralised set of men in
the city of San Francisco that set is com
posed of the officers and men who believe
that they are the First Regiment of In
fantry. National Guard. Shortly after the
return of the First California Volunteers
from Manila last August there was issued
from the very slow office at Sacramento
a hurry-up order to the effect that all the
National Guardsmen in that organization
desiring to return to the Guard, as the
majority of the rank and file had been in
the Guard at the time of enlistment in
the volunteer service, should report back
by thÂ« 80th of last November. There was
some grumbling that the rank and file
should be required to report at that
period and not be allowed the full period
of 150 days after being mustered out, as
provided in the act of the Legislature,
but there was nothing to do but to obey
orders. The spirit of National Guardlsm
was aroused and there was a sufficient
number go* to come in to make up the
muster' rolls, which were forwarded
through the proper military channels
with, it is asserted, all the necessary oaths
and other papers that go to make up mili
tary red tape. It was expected that within
a week the companies would be in full
standing, as in days of yore, but that
week passed, then another, then another
and still another, and the First Regiment
is as far from being a part of the armed
force of the State as it was en the day
the muster rolls were forwarded.
The officers and men have inquired at
all points whore there should be knowl
edge in reference to the matter, and at
each point came back the same reply,
"Don't know anything about it and can't
find out." Now comes word from the
slow ortice at Sacramento that a number
of the oaths of men did not accompany
the papers or cannot be found, and that
in many instances there are no certifi
cates of physical examination. The officers
of the several companies are positive in
thoir assertions that the oaths were for
warded and are at a loss to know what
became of them. In many instances the
oaths were forwarded at the time the men.
entered the Guard prior to the enlistment
for the war, and such ought to be in the
adjutant general's office, but it appears
that they "cannot be found." This will
necessitate another delay, and a number
of the men are so disgusted that they do
not want to be sworn in again. They are
of the opinion that one oath is sufficient.
As to medical certificates, it is impossi
ble to tile such for the reason that no or
der was ever issued designating any one
to act in the capacity of medical exam
iner. But possibly the slow office will is
sue such an order, for the attention of
that office has been called' to the necessity
therefor.
As It is now the men are disgusted with
the very slow methods and they do not
care if they never come back into the
Guard.
Those organizations that are in service
have started in to drill once more, and
they are preparing themselves for the
routine work for eleven months to come.
Some are making arrangements for the
skirmish practice at targets, which was
postponed, and some are preparing for
the annual encampment, but for the lat
ter little preparation has been made, and
there is not much en hand in the line of
tentage, blankets and mess furniture.
Sergeant Magennls of Company F,
Fifth Infantry, has applied for a nfteen
year service bar. George A. Scott, late
first sergeant of the same company, has
applied lor an exempt certificate. Second
documents which belong to the Police De
partment. Esola's friends ridicule the
etand taken by Lees and emphatically
fay that in case the anointment is given
to the lieutenant, he will have no trouble
in dislodging the ex-Chief. However,
Lees seems determined, and a merry war
is anticipated if the- coveted prize fails
to Esola.
The old Board of Police Commissioners
held another meeting yesterday and pen
sioned the following policemen for either
disability or old age: John J. Connelley,
Edward Harper. Thomas Tryon and John
Conley. Harper was formerly sergeant

at the recent meeting of the Commis

incoming board, yesterday applied to the
Commissioners for a pension, which was
granted without discussion. Harper,
prior to his being disabled, was one of
the cleverest men in the department. He

CUNNINGHAM AND LEES
MAY UNITE FORCES
Proposed Scheme of the Veteran
Thief-Catchers.
They Will Probably Organize a Western
Detective Agency â Lees Says He
Will Keep the Records.
BTOCKTON. Jan. 6â Veteran Ex-Sher
lff Torn Cunningham waa in Ban Fran
ci*co this week and called on ex-Chief
LeeÂ« of thÂ« Polloe Department there. It
is rumored, as a result of the meeting of
the two veteran man-hunLcrs, that they
were considering the Question of organ
izing one of the largest detective agencies
on thÂ« coast. When Cunningham retired.
after thirty years' continuous service, the
county paid him SSuM for his rogues' gal
lery. It contained 30.000 pictures and was
superior to that collected by Chief Lees.
Ex-Sheriff Cunningham was ask^d about
the ma.ttÂ«r to-nij?ht and said: "I just call
ed on Chief Lees to talk with him. Per
haps we could form a detective agency
that might pay, but I don't like this idea
of busting up people's crimes and sins un
less It Is for the good of the country. It
Is wonderful what a difference It makes
Â¦when you've got the people behind you In
such work.
"I might do something in a private de
tective agency business, but I have a few
dollars left, and I believe I have
enough not to start out In that di
rection. I feel very grateful to the people
of Ban Joaquln County. There was one
noticeable difference between my going
out of office and Chief Lees' resignation.
He was Jumped on and harassed on all
sides, the papers saying many unkind
words about him. On the other hand, I
don't know of a single paper which said
anything about me that did not give me
perhaps a better notice than I deserved."
The foregoing dispatch from Stockton
confirms what The Call published exclu
sively on Thursday morning, when the
announcement was made that ex-Chief
of Police Lees purposed to open a local
detective agency and Intended to retain
valuable records which he had collected
as Chief and which he had paid for
out of his private fortune. Lees then de
nied the truth of the assertion, but yes
terday he announced that he had in his
possession documents and records gath
ered by himself while Chief and that he
intended to keep them.
He argues that Esola cannot legally be
elected Chief of Police under the charter
and would have no right to the valuable
documents which have been accumulating
for so many years. For that reason Lees
will not. ha says, give up the records.
What the result -will be re-malne to be
seen, but a contest In the courts will prob
ably follow.
