MODDER RIVER, Feb. 22.â General Cron
je's wife, so prisoners say, is urging him to
surrender to save the lives of \)\s men.
Prisoners also assert that a death; blow r;as
been struck to the resistance in trje Free
State.
LONDON, Feb. 24.- : â Persistent rumors were current in
London throughout yesterday that General Cronje had
surrendered with 7060 men, but up to this moment no
official news of any such event had been received by the War
Office.
If Cronje was on Tuesdayin the position described under
the heavy fire of six field batteries, a howitzer battery and five
naval guns, his condition must have been desperate. He then
has to stand up to the projectiles thrown by forty-seven guns,
many of them of large caliber. '
This total of guns was probably largely increased on
Wednesday, as even without the horse artillery Lord Roberts
should have ninety or a hundred guns available. . New batter
ies are now arriving at the Cape, and one- may presume they
are being sent up to him, though as, yet the horses cannot be .,
fit for hard work.
Unless, therefore, very powerful Boer reinforcements ar
rive on the scene in a body, Cronje's fate must be regarded as
sealed.
All the newspapers this morning join with one accord: in'
an expression of admiration for the amazing pluck of Cronje and j ,
his men, who; after being cornered by -Lord Roberts' strategy,
arc making such a splendid 'fight. . . ... . :v . ... â , -;-.
To the west of them are their lost possessions, a compar
atively safe refuge of greac hills. To the east of them they can
hear the fateful thunder of General French's field guns, keeping
all aid away. Yet they fight stubbornly . against the "Red
Their dead and wounded are lumbering every post. Their
store wagons are flaming around them. Their oxen, which
should be with their transports, are slain by artillery or mad
with fright and thirst. They themselves seem* to be fighting for
nothing better than to justify their President's menace that he/
would stagger humanity by the lives the war would cost.
On other fields of warfare the news which has reached.
London favors the British campaign. It is true that the Boers
claim a success Tuesday on theTugela, and assert that they
drove back a body of British troops who were trying; to cross ,
the river, but from information of a later date. we. know, that the
passage was successfully accomplished.- It is still quite uncer-.
tain whether General Buller has a large Boer force before him
or only a small rear guard. The latter. seems probable.
. , ;On Wednesday the British troops appear to have advanced
very slowly. It was then thought the Boers /would take \up a ;
position on the slopes of Mount Bulwaria and enfilade the lines .
of the main British advance. The British moved in extremely
open order, and were greeted with heavy shrapnel fire from
Grobler's Klooff, which did littie damage, however. , . :
' The impression is gaining ground in Sir Redver's head- :
quarters that the Boers are merely covering, the retirement of
their entire force. White's, guns at Ladysmith have been -
turned on the Boer, positions along the Klip River to prepare :
the way for'the advance of the relieving forces.
At Colenso it is reported that General White ; has made . a '.
sortie and has captured some Wagons of the retreating /Boers..;
In.thehorth of Cape Colony a fresh British advance seems
to;have_been begun, theÃoers giving way in front of Arundel
and. -at Stormberg. Naturally
both from Natal and from Coles
berg the invaders of the British
colonies are streaming back to
their. own country to help their
hard-pressed comrades on the
Modder. From all accounts,
however, it will be impossible for
them to give material assistance,
for. Lord Roberts, with the aid oÂ£
French's cavalry, seems to be
easily able to both hold Cronje
closely invested and drive off in
detail such reinforcements as ap
pear- in the neighborhood of
Paardeberg.

i PHYSICIANS DECEIVED.
Skeptical at Pirst Regarding ths
Value of the New Pile Cure.
Many physicians for a Jong time' sup-
posed that the remarkable relief afforded
by. the Pyramid Pile CurÂ« was because
thify suppose it- -to contain -cocaiixv
rplum or similar drtwrs. but euch is not the
rase. A recent careful analysis of the
remedy shows It to be absolutely free
from cocaine, opium or In fact any poison-
ous, injurious drug whatever. It was
found to contain only healing antiseptics
and soothing oils.
For this reason the Pyramid Pile Cure
Is the only pile cure extensively used and
recommended by physicians because it Is
co safe, so prompt in the relief afforded
from a single application, and so far as
known the only positive cure for plies ex-
cept a surgical operation.
About one person In every four suffers
"from some form of piles. The most com-
mon and annoying is itching piles. Indi-
cated by warmth, slight moisture and in-
tense uncontrollable Itching in the affect-
ed parts. This form of the disease as well
as protruding, blind and bleeding piles,
readily yields to the curative action of
the Pyramid.
The usual treatment has been some sim-
ple salve or ointment which sometimes
pave temporary relief, but nothing like a
permanent cure could be expected from
such superficial remedies.
The Pyramid Pile Cure gives quicker re-
lief than any of these and the relief and
cure are permanent.
The Pyramid Is In suppository form and
the first application gives Instant relief
from the pain,, itching and soreness, and
the continued use for a short time re-
moves the tumors and the small parasites
which cause the itching and discomfort, i
The remedy Is applied at night. Is very
convenient, and. causes no detention from
daily occupation.
The Pyramid haa become the best
known, safest and most extensively sold
of any pile cure before the public.

cure of piles will be mailed free to any

CHOYNSKI
LOSES TO
WALCOTT
Referee Stops the Fight in
the Seventh to Prevent
a Knock-Out
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.-Joe Walcott, the
Barbadoes negro, received & decision over
Joe Choynskl of California in the seventh
round of what was to have been & twenty
five-round bout before the Broadway Ath
letic Clnb to-night. Choynskl was prac
tically outclassed and received very se
vere punishment. Walcott weighed la at
147 pounds and Choynskl at 163. The bet
ting made Choynski a prohibitive favor
ite, odds of 100 to 30 being freely laid on
his chances, but after the first round. In
which Choynski went to the floor five
times, the odds shifted, and at the begin
ning of the second round Walcott wavÂ» a 2
to 1 favorite.
All through the fight Walcott was on the
aggressive. He rushed Choynski, sending
his right to the stomach and left to the
head at will. In the first round Choynski
was floored five times. The first time he
measured his length on the canvas floor
he was hit with a right under the Jaw.
Another hard right in the vicinity of the
solar plexus put him down a second time,
a right cross on the jaw was the cause of
his third fall and a left on the Jaw put
him down for the fourth time. Walcott
was very nimble on his feet and danced
around while Choynski was regaining his
feet. Choynskl came up very groggy after
his fourth knockdown, only to go down
again from a right on the point of the
chin, which sent him flat on his stomach
on the. floor of the ring. It looked as if
Choynski was out for good, but five sec
onds after he went down the bell rang
and ha was helped to his corner.
Walcott forced the fighting in the reo
ond. sending his light to the body and
landing a hard left on the jaw. Chovnakl
replied with a stinging right on the head,
which staggered Walcott to the ropes.
This round was fairly evenly fought, but
Choynski, with his superior reach and
height, failed to land another good blow,
as walcott was always able to <lodee
every lead or return made by the big Call
foTnian.
They rushed to a clinch in the third,
after which Walcott jabbed his left to the
face and' swung the same hand hard to
the body. Choynski tried left and right
for the head, but Walcott got Inside of
them and put both hands to the body, and
in the clinch which followed sent his right
hard over the kidneys.
In the fourth Choynski managed to lanÂ«l
a couple of hard right-handers on the
body, but- the negro sent back lefts and
rights on the body and face, doing par
ticular damage with his left on the sld-5
of the head. The fifth round was all in
Walcott's favor, and in the sixth he cut
Choynski's right eye with a left-hand
swing. â¢
The Califomian was groggy when he
came up for the seventh round, and after
he received a right on the' wind and two
lefts on the face he staggered in an evi
dently helpless manner. Walcott then
landed left and right on the jaw, forcing
Choynski to the floor. When the latter
regained his . feet > Walcott rushed him.
but was stopped by the referee. Johnny
White, who declared Walcott the winner.
White said afterward that he felt that
another blow would have put Choynski
out. â¢ '

been bedfast for some time under the

derivedfromLydia E. Pinkham's Vege-

have gained forty pounds and am well
â a thing I never dared to expect." â
Mrs. C. E. Foland, Monett, Mo.
"For a number of years I was
troubled with .backache and leucor-

able that I could not attend to my
work or studies. The least effort
would completely exhaust me. Physi-

Miss May B. Stevenson, Alliance, 0.
and officered in the main by colonial offi
cers, has caused the greatest satisfaction
everywhere in Cape Colony. From the
very first there had been frequent com
plaints from the English population in tho
colony that they had been set back and
that no sufficient use had been made of
their readiness to serve in the defense of
their country. Full of self-sufficiency and
professional pride, the majority of our
officers displayed the supremest con
fidence in the capacity of the British to do
anything and everything, and the suprem
est belief that volunteers or civilians
could not do anything but get in
the way. Colonial advice was, as a
rule, contemptuously neglected and the
offers made by prominent colonials to
raise local forces met at first with the
greatest indifference, almost with hostil
ity." Trained by experience of many Kaffir
wars, the English borderer is in every
way the equal of tho Boer at his own
game, and adds to the Boer's skill and
watchfulness a dash and gallantry which
the latter rarely possesses." â¢
From Buller's forward lines, Bennett
Burleigh writes to the Daily Telegraph in
an equally outspoken way:
"As for cannon," he says, "it is little
short of a scandal after the lead the Sir
dar gave the Woolwich people with lyd
dite and machine guns, although the lat
ter did not get to the front in the Soudan,
that the army artillery with Buller only
comprises the fifteen-pounders and one
flve-inch howitzer battery."
Winston Churchill, in the Morning Post,
also has his fling. Writing from Spear
mans Hill, he declares "the vast amount
of baggage this army takes with It on
the march hampers its movements and ut
terly precludes all possibility of surpris
ing the enemy. I have never before seen
officers accommodated with tents on ser
vice. But here every private has canvas
shelter and the other arrangements ere
on an equally elaborate scale. The con
sequence is that marching troops are de
layed while the enemy completes his for
.tiflcations. It is poor economy to let a
soldier live well for three days at the
price of killing him on the fourth."

OF JOUBERT'S ARMY
COLENSO, Natal, Feb. 21 (via Chieve

tho Tugela over a pontoon near North
Hlanwanga and Fort Wylle. While the
naval brigade was bombarding Grobler's
Klodp, the Boers' big Creusot replied
yesterday. After the occupation of
Colenso a small party of Thorneycrof t's
Horse crossed the river, but were driven
back by fire from the tranches.
The Boer guns are still shelling the re
lieving force from the hills south of Lady
smith, but the impression is spreading
that they are merely covering the retreat
of the entire Boer force. General Buller's
casualties Tuesday, February 20, and
Wednesday, February 21, were:
Killedâ Captain Crealock and Lieuten

Somersetshire Light Infantry and nine
men.

direct road to Colesberg and Hanover.
They got close to the Boers in the hills
and were flred on. They quickly got their
guns in position and shelled the hills.'
Eventually the Boers were driven out,
retiring northward, when they came un
der the fire of two other guns, supported
by a company of Australians near the
British western post on Dragon Hill.
Colonel Henderson proceeded to Moolfon

British patrols from Hanover also came
out that far. I The Boers are not in great
force. They have been persistently ; fol

" I suffered for fifteen years without
finding any relief. I tried doctors, but
nothing seemed to do me any good. I
had falling of the womb, leucorrhoea,
pain in the back and head, and those
bearing-down pains. One bottle of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-

for four more, also two boxes of Liver
Pills and one package of Sanative
Wash. After using these I felt like a
new woman." â MrsJ Q. A. Winter,

" I was suffering with falling of the
womb, painful menstruation, head-
ache, backache, pain in groins, ex-
tending into the limbs; also a terrible
pain at left womb. , The pain in my
back was dreadful during menstrua-

If you wefe offered sure aid in time of trouble, would you put it aside
and accept something of doubtful efficiency?
If you saw before you a strong and safe bridge leading to your goal,
would you ignore it to try some insecure and tottering structure?
The answers to these questions are plain. You would, of course, choose
without hesitation what all evidence showed to be, the* safe thing, and yon
would risk nothing in useless experiments.
Why then do some women risk one of their

medicines of unknown value, which may even
prove hurtful to them 9 . .Â¦

LOOKING INTO THE
SEIZURE OF THE SABINE
LONDON, Feb. 23.â The Inquiries of the
United States Embassador, Joseph H.
Choate, on the subject of the seizure of
the British steamer Sablne, from New
York January 4, with a miscellaneous
cargo, which was captured by the British
gunboat Thrush and taken to Delagoa
Bay, have elicited the statement that
nothing Is known there except the facts
contained In the dispatch announcing the
release of the steamer. Pending the re
ceipt of official reports by the Foreign
Office nothing will be done in the matter.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23.â A good deal
of doubt surrounds the circumstances con
nected with the seizure of the British
ship Sablne. and while the action of the
State Department in Instructing Mr.
Choate to look into the matter and to
deplore such interference with commerce
was Inspired by a desire to avoid any
criticism for lack of diligence. It appears
that some points about the seizure are so
obscure as to make It questionable at
least whether or not there is yet sufficient
ground for protest. In fact, there is some
doubt as to the actual seizure, and sin
gularly enough the British Government it
self has not been informed of the event.
It Is seeking Information as to the details,
and when these are ascertained the an
swer will be made to Mr. Choate. The
State Department In this case has no
direct Information, relying on the state
ment of Peabody & Co. of New York that
their goods to the value of $30,000 had been
seized on the Sabine, according to report.
There is no certainty that any American
goods were seized, the original telegraphic
statement being that the vessel had been
eelzed and towed into Port Elizabeth to
be searched for contraband goods. But
the basis of the department's objection to
a seizure of this kind lies in the fact that
as the Sablne was bound for a British
port she might have been allowed to pro
ceed without interference to her destina
tion and there have been examined. v

LONDON, Feb. 14.â The last mails from
South Africa brought a bountiful supply
of dramatic accounts of the war. From
Ladysmith, the Tugela, Modder River,
Re*nsberg and Maf eking come thrilling epi
sodes and deeds of daring that make the
English Justly proud of the men who are
fighting their battles on the veldt. More
over, in the many published columns there
are minute explanations furnished by war
correspondents that help to take away the
sting of defeat, though these writers do
not hesitate to criticize bluntly when oc
casion demands. For Instance, the Cape
Town correspondent of the Times scath
ingly rebukes the Insular prejudice of
many British officers.
"The news of Lord ' Roberts' decision to
create an Independent colonial division,"
he writes, "under command of General

The preserves will be well patronized

to breach, or break the water, repeatedly.
Before Sunday's rain put a stop to tho

In trolling the fishermen . caught three

In company. twith .Lee Dunning ho .has
been taking trout with the fly from the

scientific research. The first week after
liberating tho winter's batch of young
salmon every trout killed had some salmon
in its stomach. During tho second week
none. of the trout had salmon,. indicating
that the latter had been able to escape

DOG SHOW JOTTINGS.
It Is seldom the selection of a Judge for

been a discordant note in the chorus of
approval at the choice of the* bench show

the matter came to the vote It proved to
be a unanimous one. Messrs. Hickman,

The Dolphins will hold the opening row

to-morrow in the waters of the bay. off
the Xorth Beach clubhouse, beginning at
about 11 o'clock in the morning. The prin
cipal event will be a race in outrigged
skiffs between George Baker and Lester
Hammersmith for the diamond medal,
which has already been won twice by
George Baker. If won three times by the
same sculler it becomes his permanent
property. There will also be a race in

The Triton Swimming and -Boating Club
lias never taken a serious part in any of
the regattas on the bay. but some of its
younger and more active members are
strongly in favor of ' the club putting
crews or single scullers into open regat
tas and it is not unlikely that the inter
r.aj dissension thus created may cause the
disruption of the club. Four well-known

plied for membership In the Dolphin Club
At their last meeting the Dolphins receiv

seventy-five will be reached.
Whether the Tritons maintain their ex
ftenceor not. they will be compelled to
leave their present quarters. Tons r>t
sand l have been washed into the cove at
the foot of I^eaven worth street and have
rendered it difficult to launch boats or to

classic event of the year In coursing, will
be run to-day and to-morrow at Union

Temple, the imported dogs, cannot go to
the flips. The chance of the drawing has
separated Luxor, "VVhitehead and Royal
Fliu?h, considered the best three dogs in
the stake, in puch a manner that they will
not meet until almost the final round, if
all prove succepsful in winning their
courses. The stake is supposed to be be
tween those three, although a strong hare
or a tricky one may put any of the cham
pions out of the running. The dogs which
may furnish a surprise are: Beacon, from
the Curtis Kennels; Russell, Allen & Wil

RAIN RETARDS
OUTDOOR WORK
OF ATHLETES
Puts a Stop to Baseball Prac
tice and Path Work
Temporarily.
BERKELEY, Feb. 23.â Little progress
has been made In athletics at the Univer
sity of California this week. The rain
has prevented the sprinters from getting
out on the track, and the baseball play
ers have only been out for batting prac
tice. The cinder track has been slushy
and soft and will not be in fit condition
until- Monday. The .clay which has been
recently placed on the curves has not had
a chanc,e to harden. As the men have
lost the entire week for training, the so
phomore-freshman field day has been
postponed from March 3 to March 10. That
will give the candidates a good opportun
ity to get into fair condition.
Captain Drum says training will com
mence next week in earnest. Then all
the men will be expected to get out every
day and do conscientious work. Gradu
ally the men who have no possible chance
of winning a big "C" this year will bo
recommended to give up work and try
again next year in the hope of some day
making the team. All are looking for
ward to a trip East and are training with
that in view. The possibility of not hav
ing a field day this year with Stanford
or an Eastern trip does not enter into
the question. When the time comes thoso
matters will decide themselves.
Wednesday a Sow of the baaebal! men
came out for batting practice. In tho
game with the Fireman's Fuml a week
ago the batting was California's strongest
point. A home run and two three-bagger*
was hit off by Krug, the crack pitcher.
Altogether, nine hits were made, a goo<l
showing for a .college team and a de
cided improvement over anything done in
that line for several years. The Call
fornians practically had the game up to
the fifth inning. Jans!ng, from the Den
tal team, la a -new man and in his first
game this afternoon showed he had good
material in him.
The game yesterday afternoon with tho
Alumni showed the big team to have Im
proved in batting, while the fielding does
not seem to have come up to the . aver
age.
To-morrow, on the Stanford campus, the
California nine will play Santa Clara. On
the Berkeley campus Stanford will play
the Fireman's Fund. These frames wÂ»era
arranged that both college teams might Â¦
become accustomed to the diamonds,' as
a match game will be played on each
campus. -Â¦Â¦; â¢ Â¦

FARMERS MAY
MEET ANNUALLY
Close of the Convention
at Stanford.
MANY INTERESTING LECTURES
PBESEBVATION OP THE FORESTS
DISCUSSED.
Memorial to Congress Urging That
Steps Be Taken to Preserve the
Calaveras Big Tree
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 23.â
The convention of fruit growers which
has been in session at Stanford Univer
sity during the past week completed its
labors to-day and adjourned to meet
probably one year hence. So helpful were
the lectures considered by those who at
tended that the university was asked by
resolution to make the course an annual
feature. As President Jordan had already
promised to do this if the result would
seem to justify it, the continuation of
the work by the university is practically
assured. During the session the daily at
tendance has been all that could b.e ex
pected for the initial convention, whfle
nearly 300 fruit growers attended one or
more of the sessions.
Preservation of Forests.
The first lecture of the day was deliv
ered by Professor W. R. Dudley of the
botany department upon "The Next Step
in Forestry." He said in part as fol
lows:
Three years ago was a turning point for the
history of the struggle for fhe preservation of
the noble forests ot the Western United States.
The President of the nation proclaimed 21,000,
000 acres of the national forests domain as
reserved from sale or entry. The question be
came a burning one, to many of the interests
involved such as lumbering, mining and stock
teeding. Every newspaper iv the West felt
bound to inforni itself upon the principles In
volved. The result was a campaign of educa
tion in forestry more rapid and effective than
the subject has known in this or any other
country. The average citizen of intelligence
dees not now need to be informed of the ele
ments of the question.
The first step in the forestry policy of the
Government was the creation or forestry reser
vations. This has been going en for nine years
until we have thirty-six iorest reservations,
aggregating 43,000,000 acres. We hope and ex
pect turther increase to these. The second ad
vance was the establishment in 1898 of the
forest-ranger system. Superintendent Newhall
of the forest reserve of Northern California,
which extends from Mount Breckenridge -in
the Tehachapi to Lake Tahoe, covers 5,000,000
acres and is patrolled during the summer, by
thirty-four rangers, shows that during ISB9
less than 2000 acres, all told, were burned over,
an area not so large as that of the Mount
Tamalpais forest fire of last October.
It will be apparent to every one that the
next step in our forestry movement should be
the building up of a great government bureau
on the basis of our excellent United States
Division of Forestry, not only for the protec
tion but the utilization and tne business man
agement of the great national property. It
should be commensurate in extent, character
and llnancial support to the United States
Geological Survey, inasmuch as the interests
concerned are quite as important. ' Its mem
bers should be educated and trained for their
work In order to insure the efficiency and hon
esty which go hand and hand with the truly
educated mind.
Co-operation Necessary.
Professor Frank A. Fetter of the
economics department opened the after
noon session by a practical talk on "Co
operation." He entered into the discus
sion from the farmers' point of view and
showed the advantages to be derived from
co-operajion, bringing out as well the dif
ficulties which such organization must al
ways expect to encounter and overcome
if they would succeed. ...
"Co-operation," he said, "is a voluntary
Joining of forces for business purposes.
Practically the many forms of
tion can be reduced under two heads, viz.:
Co-operation of consumers and co-opera
tion of producers. Oftentimes consumers
band together and start stores in order
to eliminate the middleman. In doing this
they have an advantage over the profes
sional merchant. Rent, lighting, adver
tising and clerk hire will be cheaper, as
they need not employ strictly competitive
methods. But there are many obstacles
to the success of such organizations.
Every member is a difficulty. The trouble
of co-operation is that the rate of mor
tality is about as great as that of natality.
However, there is a real need for the co
operative store. It costs too much to dis
tribute goods. The private storekeeper
has not a good case against the co
operative store, being on a plane of that
of the workingman against labor-saving
machinery.
"The largest form of co-operation is
that among producers. We find that the
most successful result is among the
simpler forms of production. Among
American farmers the commonest form
is in dairying.
"In co-operation there must be good
business management, which must always
be paid for. There must also be a co
operative spirit. When the farmers have
combined to raise the prices of their
products to the consumer they have gen
erally failed, because they are unable, like
a trust, to limit the supply. ;What they
ought to do is to lower the price to con
sumers by eliminating the profits of the
middlemen. If this can be done the ven
ture should be a success and the produc
ers should derive material benefit there
from."
Value of Bees.
The last address before the gathering
was delivered by Professor O. P. Jenkins
upon "Bees and Bee Culture." The lec
ture was illustrated by specimens of hives,
.other beekeepers' supplies and living bees
and was of vital importance to those who
have interests in that line. It was shown
that the fr.uit grower was in a position to
keep a few stands of bees for the sake
of the profit to be derived from their
product as well as the benefit which they
were to the fruit-bearing trees.
Memorial to Congress.
W. R. Dudley at this morning's session
Introduced the following memorial to
Congress, which was signed by a large
number of those present:
We the fruit growers and land holders. In
convention assembled at Stanford University,
do hereby approve of the resolution now be
fore Congress leading to the purchase by the
United States Government of the Calaveras
big trees, and earnestly petition our Congress
men to favor the same.
Before the convention finally adjourned
the following resolution was introduced
and unanimously passed:
Resolved. That we. as fruit growers and
farmers, do hereby tender our sincere thanks
for the interesting and helpful course of lec
tures which Stanford University has kindly
given for our benefit,, and we further request
that a similar course of lectures be given from
year to year. _^

The transport Hancock arrived from
Manila via Nagasaki yesterday, after a
quick run of . twenty-five - days. She
brought up ten cabin passengers and 100
discharged soldiers. Two of the passen
gers died on the trip and their bodies were
brought to San Francisco. In j all the
Hancock brought into port the remains
of 506 soldiers. Very few of these died
from wounds or were killed in battle, but
nearly all succumbed to the terrible cli
mate. From now on every transport that
comes into port will carry the remains ol
men who have died in the Philippines, but
on every ship It will be found that where
one man died in battle ten died from dys
entery, typhoid fever or malaria.
Among thÂ© cabin passengers on the
Hancock was John P. Dunning, for the
murder of whose wife Mrs. Cordelia Bot
kin is now . under sentence of Imprison
ment for life. Dunning was very anxious
to send a letter ashore, but as the vessel
went into quarantine direct he failed to
gain his point. It Â¦ will be several days
before the vessel is released, but the cabin
passengers may be allowed to land to-day.
The Oriental liner America Maru was
released from quarantine yesterday and
was docked at the Pacific Mail wharf.
She made the run from Honolulu, in the
fast time of 5 days 19 hours, but the chief
engineer expects to . beat that by two
hours next trip. Neither the America
Maru nor the Hancock saw anything ot
the transport Warren on their way here.
The latter vessel has General Joe Wheeler
aboard and is coming home by .way of
Guam and Hawaii. The chances are that
a stay of several days was made at Guam
to enable the general to see the island.
At Honolulu she would probably have to
coal, so that it will be some time next
week before the Warren caji be looked
for, even though the Hancock did leave
Manila six days after her.
There were quite a number of changes
among shipmasters yesterday. Captain
Hlnkle takes command of Â« the Orizaba,
vice Captain Parsons, who remains ashore
on sick leave. Captain Swanson takes
command of the Senator, vice Captain
Patterson, who goes to Puget Sound on

The Berkeley Professor Available Be
cause of His Knowledge of the
Language and Traits of
the Islanders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23â The name
most prominently mentioned to-night for
member of the new Philippine Commis
sion is that of Dr. Bernard Moses, pro
fessor of political economy in the Univer
sity of California. President Wheeler of
the University, who was at the White
House a few days ago, and who was of
fered by President McKinley and declined
an appointment to the commission, was
asked to name some other good man. Mr.
Wheeler suggested Professor Moses be
cause of his knowledge of the language
and traits of the people for whom the
commission -is to - frame a government.
The proposed appointment is. received by
members of the California delegation
with great satisfaction, and Representa
tive Metcalf will call upon the President
to-morrow morning to tell him so. Sena
tor Perkins is gratified at the announce
ment of Dr. Moses' probable selection,
and will cordially indorse it.
At the Cabinet meeting to-day some
time was consumed in the discussion of
the personnel of the Philipppine Commis
sion. It was stated that the President
had sent telegrams to General Luke E.
Wright of Memphis and to Henry C. Ide
of A'ermont, asking them to come to
Washington for a conference with him,
and there appears to be no doubt that
they will be asked to accept appointments
on the commission. The last remaining
member of the commission will probably
be selected from the Pacific Coast, and
there is little doubt that Professor Moses
will be named.
The Cabinet also discussed the situa
tion in Porto Rico with special reference
to the issue of food supplies to the des
titute. The question of converting ttfese
supplies into money in some cases was
discussed. The instructions to the Phil
ippine Commission were gone over at
some length. .
CONDEMN THE POLICY
OF THE ADMINISTRATION
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 23.â The second
day's session of the "Eastern Conference"
of Anti-Imperialists was characterized by
the adoption of*a strong resolution con
demning the expansion policy of the ad
ministration. During the discussion Pres
ident McKinley was > severely criticized
and held personally responsible for the
"criminal aggression of the country."
Several of the delegates objected to the
use of President McKinley's name in the
resolutions, on the ground that it was un
wise to insert personalities in a resolution
of that nature. The resolution, when lirst
presented, placed the responsibility for the
war in the Philippines with the Repub
lican party, under the lead of President
McKinley, but on motion of Moorfleld
Storey of Massachusetts the words "the
present administration" were substituted.
In offering the amendment Mr. Storey
said that the members of President Mc-
Kinley's Cabinet, who at heart were op
posed, to the policy of imperialism, but
w.ho by their silence supported it, should
be made to bear their share in the respon
sibility. In answer to the objections of
those who favored striking out the name
of Mr. McKinley, Frank Stephens of this
city said:
"That murderer is theman.who Is chiefly
to blame for the shame that rests upon
this country, and his name should not be
removed."
Senator Hoar came in for some criticism.
Several of the delegates declared that lit
tle assistance could be expected from him
owing to his stanch support of the Presi
dent. Mr. Storey of Massachusetts said
that Mr. Hoar could make an excellent
anti-imperialistic speech, had done so and
would do so again, but when the lime
came for voting he voted with the Presi
dent.
"We want it to go out to the worid,"
said Mr. Storey, "that our anti-imperial
ism is not of that sort."
Herbert Welch, in discussing the resolu
tion, said lie regarded the admislntration's
imperialistic policy as "the breaking down
of the American Union."
A further resolution was adopted recit
ing the cable report from Manila that In
surgents were hereafter to be treated as
bandits and executed. This action was
compared with the policy of General Wey
ler in Cuba.
A demand was made that Congress in
vestigate the report, and if It proves true
take summary measures to prevent the
action mentioned.
THE EMPOBIUM.
day that there were not enough suits of
underwear in the men's department to
permit of making the ' usual weekly
change of clothing. In one ward of thirty
there .were only ten clean suits, so* the re
maining twenty patients had to wear the
soiled suits or go without underclothing
until the suits they had on could be sent
to the. wash and returned.
This incident is but an illustration of
the real state of affairs resulting from
the extreme economy of the State Lu
nacy Commission, and the merchants of
Stockton who have had dealings for many
years With the asylum in a business way
are familiar with the character of the
complaints that have been lodged against
the general management. One of these
merchants, when interviewed, said that
the manner in which the finances of the
institution are conducted by the State
Lunacy Commission can ITe inferred from
the fact that goods delivered last Decem
ber have not yet been paid for.
Requisition for a Hammer.
According to this authority, everything
seems to be run on the principle that no
money should be allowed until it Is act
ually wrung from â¢ the commission, and
the people connected with the institution
are afraid to open their lips in protest.
They must first send on a requisition be
fore making any purchases to the com
mission at Sacramento, and then await its
pleasure. In the meantime the patients
are obliged to go without, and if the re
quisition is not allowed they go without
the articles for good. As a general thing,
even when the merchandise required ia
allowed at Sacramento, the amount is cut
down about one-half. Only a few months
ago they wanted a hammer at the asy
lum, said this merchant, but the authori
ties did not dare to buy one. They had
to send on an estimate of the cost and
get permission from Sacramento to make
the purcHase.
In this interview, which, by the way. is
authenticated by the Stockton Mail, the
merchant said: *
"Last summer, while down at Santa
Cruz. I was informed by Dr. Hoisholt of
the asylum's staff of physicians that the
requisition system used to be carried so
far by the commission that a patient
came near dying for lack of medicine,
which could not be bought wiUiout an
order. The requisition was sent on to
Sacramento, but no response was received
until repeated requests had been made.
Subsequently the asj-lum authorities pre
vailed on the commission to permit drugs
to be purchased without going through
the usual red tape. The local board of
managers is simply a figurehead. It can
not do anything except through the Statt
Lunacy Commission, and what it does at.
tempt to do Is generally sat down on by
the Commissioners.
"All the people out here at the hospital
are afraid to open their mouths about the
real situation, for fear of losing their jobs,
so they get along the best they can and
put up with the scrimping policy which
the State Lunacy Commission Is pursu
ing."

SACRAMENTO. Feb. 23.â According to
itorles that have reached here, the wards
of the State confined at the Stockton
Hospital for the Insane are obliged to suf
fer because of the policy of extreme econ
omy, or. rather, parsimony, which ob
tains under the present State regime.
These complaints have never taken on
such shape as to enable the public to
ascertain the exact circumstances, but
within the pan few days enouph has been
learned to justify the conclusion that a
severe shaking up is badly needed in''at
least one large State institution. Up to a
few days ago. it has been learned, the
supply of blankets on hand was not suf
ficient to allow a change of bedding: at
th*> Stockton Asylum, and many of the
beds were consequently in anything: but
a clean state. Dr. Asa Clark, the super
intendent of the asylum, has gone so far
as to acknowledge that this state of af
fairs has existed, but shields the Lunacy
Commission from blame in the premises.
Underclothing Scarce.
One of the stories which have found
their way through the wall of secrecy
built about the asylum affairs is that the
patients are poorly supplied with under
rlothing. Dr. Hoisholt. one of the medical
attendants, said in Stockton the other

PROFESSOR BERNARD MOSES.NON-CONSTITUTIONAL RULE.
THE Sacramento Bee is excited over the publi
cations of Henry Loomis Nelson, who pro
fesses to represent the views of President Mc-
Kinley. In a recent article, in Harper's Weekly Mr.
Nelson said that Congress, not being bound by the
constitution when it comes to legislation for our out
side possessions: "It may refuse to the natives and to,
the American citizens who may go to our colonies the

right > of trial by jury ; ; the right of free speech; the
right of peaceable assemblage and petition; the right
to freedom from unwarrantable arrest, and freedom
from search, and all those, rights which the constitu

The Bee declares that it cannot, believe that Presi-

dent McKinley assents to such a shamelessly un-
American proposition," that "would be deemed out
rageous even in Russia."
We are surprised that the Bee is surprised by the
announcement of this non-constitutional theory" of
government for our outside possessions. It origin
ated in the Bee's own political household, and is the
doctrine taught to the devotees of the Bryan cult.
In a letter by. Grover Cleveland these' propositions
The residents of Berkeley have struck upon a
strictly original plan to defend themselves against the
evils of a wide-open town. They have determined to
close the saloons and pay the town what it will lose in
license money. Some Croesus can reduce himself to
poverty by trying the scheme in San Francisco.
were laid down: "If, then, the suggestion is made
that the time has come for our nation to abandon its
landmarks and to follow the lights of monarchical
hazards, and that we should attempt to employ the
'simple machinery of our popular and domestic gov
ernment to serve the schemes of imperialism, your
challenge of the proposition is entirely in order. If
you are satisfied that foreign conquest and unnatural
extension or annexation are dangerous perversions of
our national mission, and if it shall seem to you in
the light of reason and history that such positions
bring in their train a people's demoralization and a
decay of popular content, more surely destructive to
the republic than armies. with banners, you will not
necessarily be wrong."
This was written at about the time Colonel Bryan
was securing the purchase of the Philippines by whip
ping Democratic Senators in to its support. -\. % r
The Examiner, political wallow-fellow of Bryan
and the Bee, attacked Cleveland abusively for that
utterance and spoke in derision of "the old land
marks," and said: "The most remarkable example in
the history of the world of the assumption of hazards
such as Mr. Cleveland indicates with fear and abhor
rence is furnished by England, and in faith England
has prospered indifferently well under all that load
of monarchical hazards. The fact that England's in
stitutions are as free and as democratic as our own;
the fact that the English nation is the most powerful
and the most enlightened in the Old World, despite
its schemes of imperialism, do not seem to affect Mr.
Cleveland's prophetic vision. It is perhaps worth
while to point out that the simple machinery of our
popular domestic government of which Mr. Cleveland
speaks will neither be changed at home nor employed
abroad, should it become necessary to administer out
side dependencies. It is in the power and right of
Congress to devise any sort of system that may apply
to the conditions of such dependencies, and this
power is in no wise limited by the national constitu
tion, nor does its application involve any change of
our domestic system. All theSe things which we have
stated, are familiar knowledge, but they do not appear
to make any part of the intellectual equipment of the
superior person who puts his faith in adjectives and
expects people to take him for granted.'.'
Now, we submit to the Bee that it must first dis
cipline its own political household before being hor
rified about the same thing said by Mr. Nelson, or
the supposed indorsement thereof by the President.
The Democratic view of the subject, stated by the
Examiner, has never, to our knowledge, been at
tacked by any representative of that party to point
out the falseness of the Examiner's teaching. Oppo
site to that view is Mr. Cleveland's, which the Ex
aminer said was opposed to "familiar knowledge" on
the subject. Can it be possible that the Bee so far
forgets itself as to indorse Mr. Cleveland?

TAX SHIRKERS BEATEN AGAIN.
ONCE more the Wells-Fargo Express Company
has been beaten in an effort to shirk the war
tax by shifting it upon the patrons of .the
company; and another proof has been given that the
courts stand ready to afford protection to the rights
of any shipper who withstands the demands of the
company and refuses to submit to its aggressions.
. In the case of G. B. Benham vs. Wells, Fargo &
Co. Justice Barry, after reviewing the issue at length,
and stating the principles of law involved in the ques
tion as to the right of the company to force the ship
per to affix or furnish for the receipt or bill of lading
the stamp required by the revenue act, concludes by
saying: "What these principles and rules are, ami
what the result of their application here, are- already
determined so far as this court is concerned. â¢ The
Superior Court has spoken and I am bound by its
decision. In Costley case vs. Wells-Farjro. No.
7620, Justice Court, affirmed by Judge Troutt Octo
ber 22, 1898; also opinion of Superior Court of Mich
igan, affirming judgment of the court below â the
foregoing decisions are overwhelmingly to the point
as to which I cite them, namely, that it is the duty of
the express company to furnish a proper legal
stamped receipt. It is evident that the express com
pany is obliged to affix the stamp and pay the tax.
The words seem so plain as not to need any author
ity." Â£;*#
It is to be noted that in the Costley case judgment
against the express company was affirmed by Judge
Troutt in 1898. More than a year has elapsed. The
express company has been defeated in every appeal
it has taken to the courts, and still goes on shirking
the tax and imposing on the public as if it had no re
spect for the courts whatever.
It is just such actions as this on the part of power
ful corporations that undermine public respect for law
and give some show of reason for the denunciations
with which agitators and demagogues assail corpora
tions of all kinds.
Wells, Fargo & Co. will continue to violate the
law and impose upon shippers just so long as the pub
lic will submit. The courts have given judgment for
thÂ« plaintiff in every case where a shipper has had the
self-respect to maintain his rights. It is now clear that
if other citizens will follow the example that has been
set the tax-shirking corporation will have to yield.
Suits should be begun at once by every shipper
upon whom the company imposes. The corporation
has fought the law for a year, but it cannot fight it
successfully. It can and will fight so long as only a
few public-spirited men stand against it in defense of
right, but it would not fight long if a general move
ment took place to resist its impositions. It is to be
hoped the suits against the shirkers will multiply rap
idly. They should be filed in every case where the ex
press company refuses to obey the law. , â¢

The SCHEMES OF THE GAMBLERS.
Wlil^A Attorney JJorn, pleading on behan 01
the racetrack gamblers, argued that the silence
of the press on the subject of reopening Ingle
ude racetrack for unlimited racing gave a tacit
ronsent to the scheme, he appears to have exposed
he tactics of the gang. Judging from his unguarded
Â¦emark it seems to have been the intention of the
.chemers to push their enterprise quietly, so that no
>rotest would be aroused and the Supervisors who
avorcd it couid say in explanation of their vote that
hey heard no objection from the people or the press,
Such being the aspect of the case, it will be well
for all the forces that co-operated to bring about the
suppression of track gambling to resume their ac
tiviiy and make known their opposition to the re
newal of the evil. It is time for the press to once
more expose the fearful record of crimes directly or
indirectly traceable to the effects of track gambling,
and for the pulpit and the civic organizations to pro
test against any surrender to the gamblers. The Su
pervisors c hould be made to understand the sentiment
of the public upon the subject, and not one of them
should be left to cast his vote for the scheme under
the impression {hat popular silence had given a tacit
consent to it.
The outburst of public indignation against the
gamblers caused by the rapid succession of appalling
crimes resulting from track gambling was so strong
at the time it forced the suppression of the evil that
many persons believed the gamblers would never
dare to seek a renewal of the license for years to
come. In that belief they dismissed the issue and
turned their attention to other things. It appears in
credible that any Board of Supervisors would con
sent to a revival of the abominations that had been
once disclosed and suppressed, and so, in a sense of
security, the people have paid little attention to what
the gamblers are doing.
It is now clear that the vultures, when their resort
was suppressed, hurried away for a time to wait until
the storm blew over. They now think the time ripe
to venture forth again and to make an effort to regain
their old place of vantage for looting the public and
untieing the unwary to bet on their prearranged races.
They construe the silence of the press and the pulpit
as an evidence of popular indifference to the issue
md have grown bold again.
In this juncture the people have a right to count
on the Supervisors to reject the scheme of the gam
blers, and a still stronger right to rely upon the
Mayor to veto any ordinance in favor of the gamblers
which the Supervisors in their folly might grant. The
Mayor signed the ordinance closing Ingleside
racetrack. He did so after the issue had been fullvdis
cussed and the evil results of track gambling had
been made known. He, in common with the com
munity generally, had before him at the time the
record of defalcations, swindles, divorces, thefts, as
saults, murders and suicides that had been caused by
gambling at the tracks or in downtown poolrooms,
not by men only, but by boys and women. He acted
therefore advisedly in signing the ordinance, and can
hardly be suspected now of a willingness to stultify
one of the moÂ«t honorable acts of his official career.
In spite, however, of this reasonable reliance upon
the Supervisors and the Mayor, the people should
riot be Â«ilrnt upon the i?sue. Not even a shadowy ex
cuv should be permitted to those who are striving to
fxt-mit a reopening of that center of a far-reaching
corruption. San Francisco has had disastrous ex
perience with unlimited racing under the control of a
set of unscrupulous Eastern adventurers, and from
thai experience should protest at once against any
renewal of their license. , .

SIGNS OF EARLY
BREAKUP IN THE
ISLAND FORCES
Returned Volunteers
to Be Discharged.
A significant order issued from the War
Department Is just being acted upon out
here. It directs the discharge of all vol
unteers who may be in the country or
who may hereafter arrive, and as a con
sequence the Presidfo surgeons are hard
at work examining men previous to the'r
discharge from' the service. There are
about fifty volunteers at the Presidio fit
for duty, and all these will have to go.
After they have been discharged those
not physically fit for duty will be dis
charged on surgeons' certificates of dis
ability.
The new order can mean nothing else
than the gradual disintegration of the
volunteer regiments. It was supposed
that when a man had been ordered home
on sick- leave he would be sent back to
his regiment as soon as he had been cured
of his disability, 1 but under the new order
he will be discharged at once. This will
do away with the convalescent company
at the Presidio and also with a large
number of casuals who have been taken
from the hospitals as fit for duty and
were waiting to be returned to their com
mands in the islands.
Another significant manipulation of the
men seems to show that within a short
time five of the regiments now in the
islands will be returned home. It has
been ordered that no more men of the
Fourteenth, Eighteenth and Twenty-third
Infantry, the Fourth Cavalry and the
Third Artillery shall be sent to the Phil
ippines. That means that every time a
man comes home from those regiments
he shall be kept at the post, even if he
be fit for duty again, and this is taken
to point to the early return of these regi
ments. They were among the first to go
to the islands and it is more than prob
able they will be the first to return. With
the order regarding volunteers taken with
this, it begins to look as if there were
some radical changes soon to be made in
the forces in the Philippines.
It has just been discovered that thÂ«
general hospital at the Presidio is a post
all by itself. The general hospital is
something new in the way of its kind,
for heretofore all the Government has had
to deal with has been the post hospital.
Returns from a post hospital are made
to post headquarters and there is no other
office work required, but with the fact
that the general hospital is a post by
itself comes also the fact that all post
returns are expected from It. and these
army headquarters has exacted from the
time qf the opening of the Institution.
As a result, Steward Gmnam and Private
Leggeman have been set at back records
and they are bringing the returns up to
date. The designation of the general hos
pital as a post Is of very recent occur
rence, and owing to the many changes
in its, patients, which must be noted just
as if they were part of the garrison, it
entails an untold amount of work.

A BANKRUPTCY LAW
THE Federal constitution gives to Congress the
power "to establish uniform laws on the sub
ject of bankruptcies throughout the United
States."
Decisions covering and construing this grant of
power have been made by the Federal courts in the
cases of Sturges vs. Crowninshield, McMillan, vs. Mc-
Neill, Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank vs. Smith, Og-,
den vs. Sanders, and many others. According to
these several judicial constructions the States may
pass bankrupt laws, provided they do not impair the
obligation' of contracts, which the constitution for
bids to the States, and provided there be no act of
Congress in force to establish a uniform system of
bankruptcy in conflict with such State laws. But an
act of a State Legislature which discharges a debtor
from all liability for debts contracted previous to his
discharge, on his surrendering his property for the
benefit of his creditors, is invalid so far as it attempts
to discharge the contract. A mere law of insolvency,
however, is not prohibited to the States. From this
digest of the decisions it will be seen* that under the
constitution the States are incapacitated for dealing
efficiently with the question of bankruptcy, -since to
make such act effective it must relieve the insolvent
of the obligation of contracts involved in his bank
ruptcy. .
It has been the practice of Congress to pass a uni
form bankruptcy law after each of our general finan
cial and business panics. Such panics catch and ruin,
as a rule, the enterprising and energetic business men
of the community, since that class are the borrowers
of capital and keep it active in those business ven
tures and investments which are the life of trade and
commerce. When this class fall into insolvency,
through no fault of their own; but as the result of
that general loÂ«s of confidence which causes a panic,
if there is provided no relief from their obligations
the community suffers through the paralysis of these
business energies. They cannot go into trade nor re
turn to gainful activities, because old scores stand
against them, and what gains they may make are sub
ject to seizure to pay on "dead horse."
In a majority of cases, if they have legal relief, their
credit is susceptible of restoration and their enterprise
can be again employed in business. The principle
upon which this is done is as old as the commercial
exchange among men. The "jubilee" provision for
Israel established by Moses was a general bankruptcy
law. Every code provided for man in organized so
ciety has recognized the need of such provision and
has supplied it.
In 1898 Cpngress passed a general bankruptcy act.
to which there seem to be objections which have
caused a demand for amendment. Our information
so far obtained seems to establish the fact that there
is a quite general disinclination to take advantage. of
the statute. The merchants of this coast have re
cently sought to secure organized action for amend
ment, and Senator Perkins has introduced a bill to
amend section 20 of the act, which relates to the oaths
required in the judicial proceedings: and section 34,
which provides for the appointment and removal of
referees and fixes their districts; and section 38, which
defines the jurisdiction of referees; and subdivision B
of section 64, which relates to the debts of the bank
lupt which shall have priority. As the latter pro
vision is of importance, since it provides a system
of preferred creditors, it may be interesting to our
readers to quote it in full: "The debts to have
priority and to be paid in full out of bankrupt es
tates and the order of payment shall be â 1. The ac
tual and necessary cost of preserving the estate sub
sequent to filing the petition. 2. The filing fees paid
by creditors in involuntary, cases. 3. The cost of ad
ministration, including the fees and mileage paid ro
witnesses as now or hereafter provided by the laws
of the United States, and one reasonable attorney's
fee for the professional services actually rendered, ir
respective of the number of attorneys employed, to
the petitioning creditors in involuntary cases, to the
bankrupt in involuntary cases while performing the
duties herein required, and to the bankrupt in volun
tary cases, as the court may allow. 4. Wages due
workmen, clerks or servants, which have been earned
within three months before the date of the commence
ment of proceedings, not to exceed $300 to each
claimant. 5. Debts owing to an 3' person who by the
laws of the States or of the United States is entitled to
As we have not received the text of Senator Per
kins' bill we are not aware of the particulars in
which it amends the sections and the subdivisions to
which it applies. We assume, however, that it applies
to the objectionable features of the statute, which
may have heretofore hampered its application to the
conditions which it is intended to deal with. Â¦ '
The bankruptcy law which followed the panic of
1873 was very beneficial to the business interests of
the country.
The law of 1898 is not self-limiting. Heretofore
there have been some objections to a standing,
statute on the subject, lest its permanence, being of
necessity a law in impairment of contracts, might in
terfere with the freedom of contract, and all business
operations rest upon contract, express or implied.
But whatever in the existing act hinders resort to
it should be removed. The country is full of busi
ness men who under compulsion refrain from enter
ing upon the activities of revived trade, since their
insolvency has destroyed their credit, and with their
debts hanging over them, and payment for "dead
horse" in prospect before they can get any benefit
from their enterprise, they have to see their active
years* pass by unused.
npHB question of the fortification or
I the non-fortification of the proposed
I Nicaraguan canal has provoked a dis
cussion , which seems to promise al
most as many laughable utterances by
civilians as any military problem usually
will. But civilians are not provoking all
the mirthâ not by. any means. In its non
fortification the certainty of the canal
being maintained as a free passage for
our navy at all times lies. We are notâ
or at least we ought not to beâ concerned
as to whether its construction will give
the ships of war of Germany, Britain,
France or -Russia an advantageous
"road" to the Orient. -If. they choose to
use it it is sensible and easy enough to
make them pay well for the privilege.
Suppose we consider the matter for a
moment: The fortification of the canal
implies the fortifying of its entire" length.
Making that statement, I happen to be
in diagonal opposition to Mr. Ambrose
Bierce, by far the ablest writer on mat
ters military contributing to any of the
papers that are at present trembling.hys
terically for the "safety of thi3 slope."
Before showing clearly how Mr, Bierce
errs in his statement that fortification of
the mouths of the canal is essential for
the protection of our interests, I wish to
pay him this tribute: I would rather have
his opinion on a military matter than that
of nearly every capable authority on sub
jects of this nature of whom I know. He
is able and clear headed, and If he is un
able to argue convincingly for "fortifica
tion" it will be pretty difficult for its pro
tagonists to find one who can.
But to the point. The fortification of
the entrances alone means Isolated fort
resses. What military man is there who
is not aware of the Initial truth that iso
lated defense Is a weakness when relief
is difficult or cannot be accorded? This
is a general principle of strategy, the law 3
of which are, as Mr. Bierce says, quite
immutable. Those who know nothing of
the art have but to look to South Africa
to-day for examples. Suppose, then, that
we fortify and garrison each entrance to
the canal; even the civilian can see that
a navy strong enough to repel our own
can escort a land force equal to the task
of reducing our fortifications if we have
no line of communication that we are
able to keep open. How shall we main
tain our communication? Is a march from
Florida suggested? Plainly, that Is ab
surd, and in the face of a superior navy
the landing of any. supporting land force
is impracticable. The truth is that un
less the navy can successfully cope with
the navy of the country that desires, to
use the canal against our wishes nothing
but the fortification of Its entire length
will avail. I suppose there is no one who
will seriously advocate this latter plan.
For the purpose of discomfiting the "for
tifying" gentlemen who hold opposite

views. I will allow Mr. Blerce himself to
show the folly of their, proposals hlmself.
On the 11th inst. he wrote:
"The Nicaraguan canal will need forti
fications at its mouths only; without them
It will virtually belong to the strongest
naval power. If we should happen to be
at war with that power It would cut our
navy in two and destroy It one-half at a
time." â¢â¢;â¢â¢Â»"" !Â».' *
Very well, my friend, having done that
would that nation then land a force and
do to our fortifications what a skilled tac
tician in command of a fairly strong army
would have done to Shatter's command
before Santiago, viz., destroy the outfit.
Shatter merely left his left flank ana rear
at the mercy of the enemy; the "forti
fications" gentlemen evidently want -to
leave both flanks and rear open, which Is,
of course, military Intelligence of high
degree.
But let us on. Having fortified the
mouths of the canal "to his great con
tent." Mr. Bierce says on the ISth inst.. In
apostrophising the members of the Sen
ate in a strain dellciously tragic:
"Let us contemplate the possibility of a
hostile fleet of battle-ships and cruisers,
their sides still clouded with the signs
of successful combat, with our own, pre
senting themselves at the Caribbean or
trance to the catal for transit to the Pa
cific. Are you prepared to ask our look
men to help them through, as under this
abominable treaty they would be com
pelled to do? Have you the hardihood to
demand that America's enemies, red
handed with American blood, shall be as
sisted to where they can easily destroy
American ships, American cities, Ameri
can men, women and children? Is.lt not
asking too much?" .: ';Â¦.Â¦,.. 'â¢
Such a vividly terrible spectacle is sure
ly enough to compel any legislative as
sembly to have pause, and verily It is
"enough to* compel a Judas to repent. Mj*
good sir, in our proposed contemplation
of these horrors indubitably our "lock
men" would have to do what they wera
ordered to do by the enemy unless they
preferred that the enemy do it hlnself.
Truly, if the canal were fortified for its
entire length they might hold out for a
much longer period, but as suggested
above it is highly probable that none tn
tertalns such a project for a moment.' It
is true that Admiral Philip has discusted
the matter, but I am afraid the distin
guished seaman is slightly more of a
dreamer than a thinker. He is one of the
beings who in all seriousness believe that
humanity may easily be on terms of
famiUarity with the Creator. But that is
another story.
And now let us see what the risks of
freedom of transit minus fortifications ar :.
An effective treaty is made with each of
the great powers guaranteeing the J neu
trality of the canal for, say, fifty years.

would be the object of sending ships to

Really nothing quite so funny, from ar.

since Captain A. T. Mahan gravely as
sured the Senate that a fleet of ships at
the Hawaiian Islands would "severely
hamper if It did not destroy any attempt

XLâ VITTURIA COLONNA.
(1490-1547.)
Those who remember the prominent
dates of history through their association
with other Important events will be as
sisted In remembering the time of Vit
toria Colonna, the celebrated Italian
woman poet, by bearing In mind that she
was contemporary with the three great
forces which brought about the Renais
sanceâviz.: The spirit of adventure which
bore fruit in the time of Columbus, the
invention of printing and the < consequent
revival of classic learning: She was born
just two years before Columbus discover
ed America; she was the friend of-Tasso
and his literary constituency, and she so
softened by their friendship the tempera
ment and work of the rugged Michael An
gelo that, her Influence . wa3 Indelibly
stamped upon the maturer work of this
king among artists. Â¦
At the time of Vittoria Colonna's birth
(1490) the family estates, already very
large, had been greatly enriched by a gift
many of her husband's Imperfections.
His last achievement, however, strained
even her loyalty. As general-ln-chlef of
the armies of Lombardy (at the age of 35)
he betrayed his allies in a treacherous
plot which he had originated against the
Emperor Charles V. As a reward for his
infamy he was accorded the rank of gen
eralissimo of the- imperial force* In Italy,
a gratification which he did not live to
enjoy for a year. When Vittoria heard
rumors of her husband's base part In this
transaction she wrote him a letter be
seeching him to abandon the project, in
sisting that she would far rather be the
wife of a loyal and upright man than of
a king. By the time this letter reached
I Pescara he was already beginning to feel
! disastr.ous*effetts from his three wounds
|at Pa via, which, combined with the un
easiness consequent upon his treachery,
I caused this Italian Benedict Arnold to ex
perience a sudden and premature falling
away of his strength. In alarm he sent
for his wife, whom he had not seen In
three years, but while hastening to Join
him she was met with the news of his
death.
manifest or other memorandum, as herein
provided, shall subject such railroad or
steamboat company, carrier, express com
pany or corporation or person to a penalty
of $50 for each offense, and no such bill
of lading, manifest or other memorandum
shall be used in evidence unless it be duly
stamped as aforesaid."
The decision in the case now under con
sideration turns on the proper construc
tion of schedule A. quoted above. It will
be observed that it is the duty of the com
mon carrier to issue to the shipper a bill
of lading or other evidence of receipt, a
Â¦ legal receipt, which Ms a stamped . receipt
If the common carrier should refuse to
lasue a stamped receipt, It must pay a pen
alty of $50 for each offense. When we find
that Congress has tn such a case provided
that for violation of this enactment liabil
ity In the sum of $50 Fhall attach, the in
ference is irresistible that a penalty was
* intended to be imposed on the common car
rier and not the shipper.
It is plain to me that it Is the Intention of
Congress to require the express companies
to deliver to the person offering for ship
ment any goods or packages, a receipt for
the same, and it requires *ald receipt to
have attached to It a revenue stamp of 1
cent. It is the duty of the express com
pany to deliver to such shipper a full and
complete receipt; and a receipt would not
be full and complete or legal unless It had
attached to It a canceled revenue stamp of
the value of 1 cent.
It is true that the express company, the
defendant, has a right to determine within
reasonable limits what Its charges would
be for the transportation of goods through
its office, but the right to determine and
make reasonaable charges for transportation
of goods is. in my opinion, a different thing
from the increase of rates which has hith
erto been deemed reasonable for the pur
pose of evading the payment of the tax
directed by Congress for the raising of rev
enue for carrying on the war.
No Encouragement for Evasion.
I do not believe under any view that may
be taken of the law, that liny court could
properly encourage any person or corpora
tion in thus evading a duty which is clear
ly Imposed on it by the act of Congress.
It may be burdensome upon the defendant
to have to pay the tax. But as it is Im
posed clearly by the lawmaklng power, it
is the duty of the court regardless of con
sequence! to enforce it.
It is admitted, and It is conclusive so far
as this action Is concerned, that the charge
of SO cents was tendered by the plaintiff,
and It is conceded by the pleadings that
such charge was the regular and usual
charge for such services.
What these principles and rules are. and
what the result of their application here,
are already determined so far as this court
Is concerned. The Superior Court has
spoken, and I am bound by its decision.
In Costley vs. Wells-Farffo. No. 7610. Jus
tice Court affirmed by Judge Troutt, Oc
tober 22, 1S98; also opinion of Superior Court
of Michigan, affirming Judgment of the
court below; the foregoing decisions are
overwhelmingly to the point as to which I
cite them, namely, that it is the duty of
the express company to furnish a proper
legal stamped' receipt. It Is evident that
the express company Is obliged to affix the
stamp and pay the tax. ' The words seem
so plain as not to need any authority.
Judgment for the plaintiff for $10 and
costs.
WELLS-FARGO MUST OBEY
THE WAR REVENUE LAWS
it n . i i
Judge Barry Again
Decides in Favor
of the People.
Avaricious Corporation
Cannot Legally In
crease Rates.
WELLS, FARGO & CO. have
again met defeat in their effort
to evade the burden Imposed
upon the corporation as a com
mon carrier under the provis
ions of the war revenue laws. Ever since
the enactment of these laws litigation, In
which Wells, Fargo & Co. appeared as de
fendants, and In which the plaintiffs went
Into court to combat the shifting of this
burden upon their shoulders, has dragged
Its weary length through the, tiresome
and endless technicalities of the law.
Each time the defendant corporation met
defeat and Its duty toward the people
and the Government was pointed out to
it anew. With that persistence, however,
which Is born of avarice, it continued to
defy the law, as litigation. If. properly
handled, is cheaper than obedience to the
mandates of the contested statutes.
Justice of the Peace Barry yesterday
handed down an opinion In the case of
G. B. Benham against Wells, Fargo &
Co., which was Instituted to recover, dam
ages for the refusal of the corporation to
accept a package for shipment without
there was first affixed to the manifest,
evidencing the transaction, a revenue
stamp, as required by law. In his opinion
Judge Barry sustained his decision here
tofore rendered in the case of Costley
against the corporation, and ordered that
Judgment be entered in favor of the plain
tiff for $10 and costs of action. ! Judge
Barry holds that the corporation Is con
clusively responsible for the payment of
the tax, and that the law makes it man
datory upon the corporation to bear this
burden and not shift it upon the shoulders
of Its patrons, "for the words seem so
plain as not to need any authority."
Cannot Raise the Bates.
Although the point was not m issue In
the case at bar, Judge Barry virtually
decides that â¢ the threat of the company
to raise its rates for the transportation
of goods if forced to pay the war tax, in
order to "evade the duty imposed upon
it by act of Congress," is plainly illegal,
and says that this course could not prop
erly be encouraged by any court in the
land. Judge Barry's decision reads:
This Is an action by O. B. Benham
against Wells, Fargo & Co.. common car
riers, engaged in the business of carrying
freight, goods and merchandise to and from
different parts of the State of California.
The question Involved, outside of the ques
tion of damages, is as to the construction
of schedule A of the war revenue law of
the United States of 1898, entitled "An
act to provide ways and means to meet
war expenditure, and for other purposes,
approved June 18. 1898," which reads as fol
"Express and freightâ lt shall be the duty
of every railroad or steamboat company,
carrier, express companyjor corporations or
persons whose occupations are to act as
such, to Issue to the shipper or consignor,
or his agent, or person from whom any
goods are accepted for transportation, a
bill of lading, manifest, or other evidence
of receipt and forwarding for each ship
ment received for carriage and transporta
tion, whether in bulk or in boxes, bales or
bundles,- or not so enclosed or Inclosed;
and there shall be duly attached and can
celed as Is In this act provided, to each
,of said bills of lading, manifest or memor
andum, and to each duplicate thereof, a
stamp of the value of 1 cent.
"Provided, that but one bill of lading
shall be required on bundles or packages
of newspapers when Inclosed In one gen
eral bundle at the time of shipment.

about 5 feet 6 Inches tall and weighed
about 135 pounds. He waa dressed In a
dark suit of clothes and also wore a derby
hat. Both men had their coats buttoned
up to their chins.
Immediately after the robbery was re
ported at police headquarters several de
tectives were sent to arrest the pair. Ac
companied by Connell, they visited the
water front, expecting that the robbers
would attempt. to leave the city. After
waiting some time Connell espied a man
whom ne thought was one of the Individ
uals who held him up. He was taken into
custody and at once removed In the patrol
wagon to police headquarters, where he
was recognized by Detectives Ryan and
O*Dea of the Southern Station as "Jack"
Ennis, an all-around crook. Notwith
standing that Connell was almost positive
that Ennis was one of the robbers, the
suspect proved that he was In the City
and County Hospital, visiting a <Â«lck
friend, at the time of the holdup. He.was
then allowed to go after being told that
his presence was not desired In this city.
At the agre of 38 the Marchioness of Pes
cara, always better known by her maiden
name of Vlttorla Colonna, became a
widow and spent the next ten years of
her life tn writing poems of despair.
While these sonnets show a great Im
provement over those written to while
away the time In her Ischian retreatâ as
all work gains in strength under sorrow's
stern discipline â they still lacked the
forceful hand of a great poet. One hundred
anil thirty-four in all. the changes are
rung with amazing ingenuity upon the
virtues of the ferocious Pescara. one son
net even going so far as to express the
widow's metrical fear that she might not
be sufficiently prepared to be admitted
into the same heaven with her incom
parable spouse. Those who bring heavily
the charge of insincerity against these
poems, which were eagerly awaited by
the literary populace and jealously handed
from king to cardinal, must remembT
that at this time the sonnet, despite Us
artificial restrictions, was the acknowl
edged vehicle of the thought of the day:
that the lothsome details of Pescara's
cruelty probably never pierced the insu
lar solitude of Ischia, and that Vittoria,
who had seen her husband but seldom
since he became a professional warrior,
lived largely upon her memories of their
romantic youth.
During the latter part of her life the
Marchioness became deeply interested in
the more progressive religious views stir
ring through intellectual Europe, and her
later sonnets known as the "Rime Epirltu
ale" show plainly the broadening touch of
the renaissance. Several medals which were
struck of her at this time show her In the
full bloom of her power and attest the
adoration of Italy. She lived to see threa
editions of her poems published, copies of
her sonnets being as eagerly sought as fH
the book of the day In our circulating li
brary. She was, however, utterly un
spoiled by the adulation of the contempo
rary poets, wits, diplomatists and other
officers of state or church, because her
mind was set upon higher things.
The last ten years of her life were hal
lowed by the pure friendship of Michael
Angelo. The grace and delicacy of Vit
toria's earlier sonnets now gained In fores
and Inspired the great arist to wield thÂ«
poet's pen with the same boldness with
which he had used the chisel and the
brush. She also did much to soften tha
harshness of the artist's religious views,
and his biographers record with satisfac
tion that the last few years of his embit
tered life were sweetened by the compan
ionship of so noble a woman. One of
Michael Angelo's sonnets pays this appre
ciative tribute to her benignant Influence:
If it be true that any beauteous thing
Raises the pur* and just desire of man

torla Colonna's strength that she went fn
to the retirement of a convent as stre had
done at the time of her husband's death.

for it lacked the originality and creatlva
force of genius. Nevertheless It was qu!tÂ«
on a par with the work of Taxso and his
contemporaries, and was closely modeled
after the work of her master, Petrarch.
Judged by the standards of the time,
which polished the shell at the expense of
the kernel, her sonnets proved the one
point of unanimity hi faction-split Italy,
which accorded her numberless ovations
and the title of the divine In poetry, with
the same enthusiasm with which it bo
stowed upon her contemporary, Raphael,
the title of the divine In, art. n
of many beautiful towns and castles from
Martin, the- Colonna Pope, a great-uncle
of Vlttorla's father. It waa in one of
these newly acquired strongholds, the
castle of Gondolfo, whose wooded heights
overlooked the lake of Albano and the
picturesquely walled but gloomy town of
Marino, that the baby Vlttorla was born.
She was not destined, however, to remain
long in this feudal retreat, where the tur
bulent Colonnas aad their kindred, the
Orsinls, raided and harried each other's
fiefs, much In the manner of the bor
der warriors of Scotland. .'.'-{
In order to cement more firmly the
shifting alletriance which the princely
Colonnas had sworn to Ferdinand, King
of Aragon, this monarch arranged a mar
riage between Vittoria, then a child of 4
years, and his subject, Ferdinand d'Ava
los, son of the Marquis of Pescara. a lit
tle boy of her own age. As this childish
betrothal was decided upon with about as
much sentiment as a feudal lord would
display In bartering hU serfs, it is rather
surprising to learn that the openly mer
cenary transaction turned out most fa
vorably for these princely children. -Im
mediately after her betrothal Vittoria was
sent to the Island of Ischla, the home of
her future husband, that she might be
educated with him under the care of the
widowed Constahza d'Avalos, Duchess of
Francavilla, the young Pescara's elder
sister. This remarkable woman, by
royal appointment, had teen made Gov
ernor and Chatelaine of Ischia, one of the
most important keys of the kingdom. In
this capacity she showed rare prudence
and energy, and as an eminently cultured
woman gathered to her island home the
finest Intellects of the day. In this de
lightful atmosphere Vittoria and Ferdi
nand developed congenial literary tastes
and passed most happily and affectionate
ly the days of their betrothal.
When they reached the age of 17 their
marriage was celebrated in Ischla with
much pomp and ceremony. The flower of
Italy, sailing homeward in their beauti
fully appointed boats from the Island wed
ding, pronounced the bride and groom to
be mentally and physically of the noblest
patrician type. Among the family archives
in the Colonna palace is to be found a
most painstaking document setting forth
the merits, color and price of the elaborate
gifts exchanged by the bride and bride
groom. The two-year honeymoon follow
ing this brilliant wedding has frequently
been alluded to by Vittoria as the truly
happy part of her life.
At the end of this time Italy was about
to enter upon that period generally xnown
as the second dark age in her history.
During the three years between 1493 and
1495 Naples had been governed, more lit
erally, plundered, by five Kings. Milan,
too, had proved a tempting bone of'con
tention for which the Kings of France
and Spain were carrying on bloody war
fare, the -Pope siding with Spain while
Venice aided France. When one considers
that this yeasty ferment was but typical
of the upheavals convulsing all parts of
Italy one can better comprehend the state
of affairs which urged the young Pescara
to leave his bride, buckla on nls shield
bearing the ancient motto "With this or
on this" and join his father-in-law In the
fields of Lombardy. In the early part of
his career flying visits home, which grad
ually became more hurried and less fre
quent relieved the sternness of his life.
He was left for dead upon the field of
Ravenna, but recovered from nig wounds
during a short Imprisonment at Milan.
While here he diverted himself sonvwhat
after the fashion conspicuous In Marlbor
ough by writing a "Dialogo d'Araore," in
scribed to his wife. Her reply. In a pot-m
112 lines long. Is noteworthy, not so much
on account of It 9 Ingenious elegance and
triteness as becau9e It Is the first of her
writings upon which her claim as poet
was founded. .
In Ischia Vlttorla strove to prove h*r*elf
as true a soldier's wife as she had been a
soldier's daughter, and beguiled Pcs
cara's absence by her studies with the
noted wits and scholars of the day and by
devoting herself to the education and
moral development of her adopted son.
Alphonso d'Avalos. the "cousin and heir ot
her husband. Vittoria discovered in this
beautiful but somewhat wayward l>or a
fine intellect and the materials of a noble
man. These she -so carefully developed
that the llttle : tamed lion soon loved her
as a son, became a brave, renowned mar,
and always looked upon his gentle, child
less: guardian as the mother of his moral
As far as possible Vittoria kept herself
In touch - with her ?h usband's prowess,
passing affectionately over many of those
portions of his life which modern histo
rians condemn. Descendant ; herself of a
long illustrious line ; of freebooters noted
for clannish warfare and sharing the gen
eral, insensibility to the call of patriotism,

sf.the Pacific Coast, and al*o over the Rocky
Mountain region. The pressure has fallen slow
ly, from Cape Mendocino northm-ard. There are
go indications of the approach of a storm on
the North Pacific Coast, but the fact that a
.arge high area is now well Inland, and that
Ihere is apparently a slight retrogression west
ward of the permanent high over the South

n;ght southeasterly winds and rain will occur
*n. the Pacific Coast from San Francisco north
ward. High temperatures . continue over the
Pacific Coast.
No rain has fallen on' the coast south of
N'eah Bay.
A maximum wind velocity of thirty miles per

Bradstreet's Financial Review.
IfEW YORK. Feb. 23.â Bradstreet' s Financial
Review to-morrow, will say: Dullness and. the
predominance of . professional trading were
again the most pronounced features of the
speculative week. The conditions ' which pre
vailed in Wall street, however, found their
duplicate in the state of the London market,
which, though rendered more cheerful . by the
news of British successes in the recent opera
tions in South Africa, seems, like our own,
without immediate attractions for the public.
Nearly all the developments of the week have
been of a favorable character. Large Increases
In current railroad earnings are reported and
the annual reports of several industrial and
railroad Incorporations have appeared, making
in all cases a most excellent showing. The
responses to such factors have, however, been
limited, and though the street Is somewhat
impressed with the belief that the expected
-pasrage of the currency and refunding bill at
Washington will give a decided Impetus to
speculation there is an apparent henltatlon to
act upon this. ldea. Money, it would appear,
tends to work a little firmer for the time being
and this perhaps -limits the activity of the
bull pools and' large interests which favor that
side of tb* speculative account. 'The recent
heavy increases in the volume of the New
York bank loans and the reports of large de
mands for financial accommodations on the
part of mercantile Interests in various parts
of the country, pointing as they do to ex
tremely active trade conditions, may perhaps
explain the preoccupation of the public and
Its temporary Indifference to the stock market.
There has appeared to be no evidence of bear
ish sentiment and manipulation of that kind
has-been confined to a few specialties in
which circumstances afforded opportunity for
such maneuvering. At the same -time the/ re
sponse of the market to a succession of favor
able developments has been limited - and hes
itating and the falling off in the volume of
general transactions shows plainly that for the
time being the market has been left to the
traders and the latter, on the whole are
afraid to sell It short, while they cannot dis
cern signs of the public Interest and support
that would justify them in actively espousing
the long side. Evident, manipulation of large
interests in Third Avenue stock, involving ap
parently on the one hand an . effort to create
a market for. a large . holding of the security
and on the other the possibility of attempu
, to depress the price of the stock for the ben

CHICAGO, Feb. 23. â The news, from .'Argentina
held the center of the bulletin ' board on the
Board of Trade to-day. Â¦ Other bearish news was
merely subsidiary to it. The shipments from
Argentine, 2,320,000, were exceeded only twice
last year and have not been exceeded often in
the history of the commerce of that country.
In ' consequence May . wheat opened %c under
Wednesday at 67%@67i4c The price touched
67@67*4c and later 67*4 c. Between quotations It
fluctuated for two hours. Then the descent
began. Under pressure of foreign selling and
bull liquidation, with scarcely any outside.de
mand, the price of May wheat was forced stead
ily down to 66*4 c, at which the market for that
option closed, lamentably weak, and l*Â£Â®lttc
under Wednesday.
Corn tbi inclined toward firmness, but fin
ally succumbed to the. wheat weakness. Trade
generally was quiet. Country offerings were
fair, but the shipping demand was poor. May
closed *4@%c down at 34%@34%c.
'â¢he trade in oats was small and Influenced
most of the time by corn. In view of the weak
ness about It the market was remarkably
steady. May closed a shade depressed at 23*4 c.
Provisions were dull. The market early was
easy with wheat, later firm with the corn bulge,
but again weak with wheat. A firm hog market
had a steadying effect. May pork closed 10Â©
12*4 c under Wednesday, May lard 2*4 c down ana
May ribs 7'4c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
NEW. YORK. Feb. 23.â Bradstreet' a review
of . the state of trade will say: General dis
tributive trade 'Is of ; fairly good volume al
though affected, by -weather conditions and
holidays. Spring business is enlarging at many
markets East and Weet, the presence of buy
ers. being encouraged by special passenger
rates. A eoftenlng of prices of speculatively
dealt in staples Is to be noted, but the re
actions are of narrow extent. Money Is steady
as a whole and no higher than a week ago.
Bank " clearings comparisons are rather less
favorable, partly because of less pronounced
speculative activity at' this time last year.
Gains in railway earnings for the. first two
weeks of February are of absolutely phe
nomenal proportions, but it must be remem
bered that there were exceptionally severe
weather conditions experienced last year. _ In
spite- of' this; however, it is to be said that
east-bound tonnage is of unparallelled volume,
while shipments of spring goods to the country
are very large. That rail rates are being
badly cut Is confidently, asserted. The earn
ings of sixty roads for the second week of
February aggregate $7,941,000, an Increase of
30.4 per cent over the same period a year ago.
Business aÂ« a whole continues on a large scale,
encouraging alike to distributors and con
sumers.
Â¦Foreign demand for wheat remains small,
American stocks are large, farmers are re
ported holding supplies back and crop dam-,
age scares are discounted by mild weather.
The strength of corn has been a feature, for
eign demand being of good proportions a.aa
this has furnished a supporting element In
the wheat market. General complaint of the
low grade of offerings comes from primary
markets. High prices for flaxseed are ex
pected to encourage the planting of much land
ordinarily devoted to spring wheat in the
Northwest.
There is a larger volume of business in pig
iron - at some markets, but less at others and
prices of that product are quite steady.
The floating of the new sheet combination
has imparted strength to that branch of trade.
Heavy engagements have relieved the pres
sure in that line somewhere.
Structural Iron continues active, indicating
heavy building operations the coming spring
and. summer. Foreign iron markets retain all
their old strength and "lower ocean freight
would. It la argued, bring about a great en
largement of our export trade.
Copper is quieter, but steady in price and
tin notes a further advance in sympathy with
foreign speculation. Hardware U Improving
in distribution at the West. -
Business failures for the week number 163,
as compared with 199 a week ago, 120 in this
week a year ago and 183 in 1858. 258 in 1897
and 270 in 1895.
The strength of staple values is a feature
of Canadian trade. Toronto reports heavy buy
ing of spring and summer goods. Retailers
will -carry over some stocks of winter clothing.
Industrial activity is very marked, Canadian
factories running to their fullest capacity.
Failures for the week number 28, as compared

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review, of Trade to-morrow will say:
Prices in materials are yielding. If not the
best news possible for some speculators it is
the best that could come for the country
since industries could not long prosper without
reaction from the extreme prices caused by
actual or supposed scarcity of materials last
year. Borne help comes from new iron fur
naces that have opened or approach comple
tion, some from the famine in India which
sends hither shiploads of hides, some from the
much-increased stocks of sheep which have
weathered the winter and some from the open
ing of new iron, zinc and copper mines. The
causes are many, but the revision of quota
tions gives promise of greater activity In all
the chief industries.
The great iron industry has been embar
rassed by prices for pig and billets, which were
no' longer sustained by the gradually yielding
prices of products^ Considerable transactions
are now reported at Philadelphia. $1 to $1 50
per ton below recent quotations; at Plttsburg
20,000 tons bessemer - have been sold and 75,000
tons billets, both iron and steel being re
ported $1 per ton lower. The new furnaces
supplying foundry iron have been competing
sharply at the East and small sales of besse
mer have been made for Pittabury delivery at
60c â¢ to 65c below previous quotations. . Sheets
are strengthened there by the new combina
tions, though it does not embrace some 'largo
works, but with this addition of 600,000 tons
yearly and its sales to the hoop and tin plate
companies the National Steel has secured large
and rich mines in Minnesota. Plates are still
weak as most consumers are provided far
ahead, but the Pacific orders cover 2000 tons
and the Chicago and Northwestern has placed
orders to the East for 6600 tons bridge work.
Rail mills are full, but have taken a small
contract for export and better business enables
tin plate works which have been idle to re
sume.
Cheaper hides and leather enable boot and
shoemakers to take contracts for split goods
at 2'Ae less than prices recently asked and
some large sales have resulted, giving part of
the shops work for some time. Others are
getting very few orders and some are stopping
or expecting to stop in two weeks. The yield-
Ing in split leather began early this month
and in hemlock sole a week earlier and has
reached lc per pound, while this week union
backs and kip and glove grain upper leather
are cheaper. Hides at Chicago have again
yielded, making 3 per cent fall in a month
and 7.3 per cent since December 30. Supplies
accumulate â¢ and on wharves at Jersey City
250,000 hides were landed from India. Ship
ments of boots and shoes from the East have
been in three weeks 25.193 cases, against 43,719
in '1898. the largest previous year.
At last it is admitted wool quotations so
long held are fully 3c per scoured pound higher
than prices in large actual sales last week
and since, the decline covering grades between
one-quarter blood and lower, which is in de
mand and scarce and fine fleece graded XX
or. over. The explanations are many. The fact
is that when mills made enormous sales of
heavy weight goods and then bought no wool
the fable that their stocks were exhausted
ceased to have force. In fine medium territory
selling at 8c scoured and other wool down to the
low grades the fall is general and English
markets are also weaker. Goods of fine grades
have been opened with much less advance in
price than was made in cheaper grades, but
cancellations continue numerous.
Failures in three weeks have been $7,241,230,
against $7,129,780 last year and $7,293,439 in
l&9B,"but in the previous- years they exceeded
$10,600,000. Manufacturing were $2,856,536,
against $3,643,864 last year, and trading 'were
$3,822,930. against $3,237,472 last year.
Failures for the week have been In the
United States 201, against 191 last year, and 33
in Canada, against 40 last year.

CAPITALIST IN
DURANCE VILE
Alfred Barker Arrested
in Sari Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 23.â Capitalist Alfred
Barker was a prisoner at the County Jail
all of* to-day. This state of affairs was
brought about through Mr. Barker ex
pressing a determination to take a trip
East before paying $6000 due the insolvent
Union Savings Bank on assessments
levied on 100 shares of stock owned by
Barker. "While supposed to be a prisoner
in every sense of the word. Capitalist
Barker was allowed the freedom of the
yard and office and made frequent trips
outside in search of cigars and refresh
ments.
A couple of weeks ago Ed Rea, attor
ney for the Union Savings Bank, secured
a warrant for Barker's arrest from Judge
Lorlgan on the ground that the capitalist
was about. to leave the State for the pur
pose of defrauding his creditors and es
peciaJly the Union Savings Bank, out of
JGOOO due on .assessments. Barker was
finally arrested, but released on J2OOO ball
pending a decision on a writ of habeas
corpus secured before Judge Hyland.
To-day Judge Hyland denied the writ,
holding that he had no right to review the
action of another branch of the Superior
Court and that the Supreme Court was
the proper court of jurisdiction. Barker
was at once remanded to the custody of
Sheriff Langford. '
Attorney Cothran, counsel for Barker,
at once left for San Francisco, where a
writ of habeas corpus will be sued out in
the Supreme Court.
When Judge Lorigan issued the order
of arrest he placed Barker's bond at
$5000. This is the amount of assessments
due the Union Savings Bank. It is said
that should the bond be given It could be
collected also for the assessment In case
the bank obtains Judgment against Bar
ker and that this is the cause of the legal
fight.*
Barker denounces his arrest as 'Â¦ pplte
work of ex-Boss Rea. When the board of
directors to wind up â¢ the affairs of the
bank was about to be named, - Barker
says, Rea wanted him to serve in the
directorate, buthe declined to do so, and
told Rea he did not consider him a fit per
son to conduct the affairs of the bank.
Since then, he declares, he has been perse
cuted by Rea.- -Â« "

OF REPUBLICAN
PARTY LEADERS
Major McLaughlin Is
in Accord.
READY TO, ISSUE A NOTICE
PROMPT DENIAL OF A STATE
MENT TO THE CONTRARY.
Republicans Are Ready to Take De
cisive I>eparture From the Prin
ciple of Recog^nizLng Hail- â¢
road or Boss Decrees.
According to the provisions of the Po
litical Code of California Presidential
Electors and members of Congress are
State officers and therefore must be'nom
inated and placed on the. ticket as the
election laws of this State direct. Dele
gates to a State or Congressional district
convention called for the purpose of
choosing delegates to represent the State
or any Congressional district of the State
In a national convention are not classed
as State officers and no provision is made
for their choice In the law relating to pri
mary elections, j
The point is raised by leading poli
ticians, therefore,' that, the delegates
chosen by the Congressional districts to
elect delegates to the national convention
of either " party cannot under the law
place on the ticket to be voted for by
the people a candidate for Congress. Be
fore the primary election law was enacted
it was the custom of delegates attending
a State convention for the purpose of
selecting delegates to the national con
vention to separate from the main body
and organize Congressional district con
ventions and then proceed Immediately to
the nomination of candidates for Con
gress. â¢
According to the call of the National
Republican Committee "the Congressional
district delegates shall be elected. by con
ventions called by the Congressional com
mittee of each district In the manner of
nominating the candidate, for Represen
tative in congress." The language of the
call in this respect is so clear and sig
nificant that primary elections corre
sponding to the system provided in the
primary election law must be held to
choose delegates to tha Congressional
district convention.
Many questions for the Republican State
Central Committee to consider are â¢ pre
sented, hence an early meeting of that or
ganization is desired by Republican
voters,- who are earnestly In favor of-har
monizing all the differences In the party
without making a single concession to tha
railroad or boss influences. The remark
Is frequently made that no political party
can win in California without the support
of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It is
called to mind that Estee was defeated
for Governor because the railroad Â¦ sup
ported Stoneman. Whether the assertion
be correct or false, the time has come
for the Republican party, through the
confidence of the people, to take a de
cisive departure from the principle of rec
ognizing the railroad power as the gov
erning agency in California, .
It was said at Sacramento by the fol
lowers of Burns and Herrin that the
Southern Pacific never lost a battle for
the Senatorship in a California Legisla
ture. The old-time adherents of the cor
poration regarded resistance to the rail
road decree as political suicide, but the
independent Republican of the Legisla
ture, sustained by an independent press
and the prestige of the people, resisted the
decrees of the arrogant corporation and
won a battle which emancipated the State
from the rule of bosses. The voters of
the party ought to be -as bra\'e and alert
as were their representatives at Sacra
mento. ; â¢â¢ 'â¢Â«.
Yesterday evening Major McLaughlin
sent word to this Journal that the pur
ported interview with him. published in
the Bulletin, was false. Major McLaugh
lin stands ready to cull a meeting of the
State committee for an early date. As
soon as a proper request is presented to
him he will issue a nctice for members of
the committee to assd-mble.

"" "Bull Pen."
Epe-cta.l WsjuUch to ThÂ« Call
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23.-The Investi
gation of the action of the military and
civil authorities in the Coeur d'Alene riots
was continued by the House Committee
on Military Affairs. H. W. Stlnson testi
fied at length as to life In the "bull pen,"
where the accused miners were Incarcer
ated. His description was supplemented
by a large number of photographs show
ing the prison lnclosure, consisting of a
number of rude shanties surrounded by a
wire f enceÂ» . The witness was a ' School
Commissioner and was removed for al
leged sympathy with the miners and sub
sequently arrested. He said the "bull
pen" was very filthy. The men ate off
the ground and the food was bad. There
were practically no sanitary arrange
ments. The witness said his mall was
opened. On one occasion, when his wife
was badly injured and in a delicate con
dition, he was refused permission to go to
her.
Stinson also told of the guardhouse, a
part of the "bull pen," where he and
others were held most of the time. Rain
beat through it and the - inmates were
often soaking wet. The Btraw had been
trampled Into the ground and the officers
in charge of the United States forces re
fused to allow hay to be brought In.
Many drunken soldiers were put in the
guardhouse with the accused.
An army officer, he said, ordered a cor
poral to take a cigar from the witness,
and when the latter threw the cigar
down the officer reduced the corporal to
the ranks for not snatching it. The offi
cer ordered that the men be treated with
severity.
Extended- discussion occurred t among;
members of the committee over the ef
fort of Lentz and Sulzer to introduce a
newspaper Interview with Bartlett Sin
clair, the Auditor of Idaho. The commit
tee finally voted not to admit that line
of testimony. Sulzer noted an exception,
and Lentz said the House was a superior
body to which appeal could be made.
SAN" RAFA-EL. Feb. 23.â Unreasoning
revenge is the apparent motive for an act
<>f brutality committed on a horse belong
ing to Carl Webber of Corte Madera by
an unknown miscreant this morning.
The animal's tongue was almost cut in
half by a piece of barbed wire which was
twisted round it. Several boys passing
Webber's barn, which etands In an iso
lated position, at that time were startled
by the ecreain of a horse In agony. En
tering the barn, the horse, a valuable ani
n*a!, was found rolling on the ground,
-Ahile blood poured from between its lips.
At the same - time a man, who had lain
concealed behind some hay. rushed out of
the door and made good his escape. Af
:â¢ -r a short pursuit the boys notified Sta
tion Agent Blake at Corte Madera, who
telephoned Frank Treanor, special officer
. : the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Blake then hastened
to the relief of the tortured animal, but
iSttle could be done to alleviate Its suffer
ing until the arrival of Treanor, who found
ibp wire had been wrapped twlcÂ« round
the anitnals' tongue and twisted with the
aid of pincers till buried in the flesh.
Treanor. with much difficulty, severed the
wire. Upon its removal the " animal's
tongue ewelled to such a size that breath-
Ing became difficult and it had to be
brougtet to San Rafael and the injured
member laiiced by Veterinary M. Murray.
whejo it became reduced in Eire.
This U the second case of Inhuman
treatment of horses. which has occurred
In the county within a short time and
fc-ellng In the community runs high. Wil
liam Vanning, a milkman, was the other
man to subject a horse to almost the
t=am* treatment, though in his case the
tor.g-ue was pulled completely out.

Suicide of a Prisoner.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Feb. 23:â Low Sing,
the Chinaman recently convicted of mur
der at Bingham City and sentenced to be
shot, committed suicide by hanging him
self In his cell this morning.
FOOTPAD FONTE TRIES
SUICIDE IN HIS CELL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Feb. 23.
Fred Fonte. the last member of the foot
pad gang who made his confession to
Chief of Police Hodgklns a few days ago,
to-day tried to commit suicide in his cell
in the City Prison. He took nearly all of
a bottle of medicine which had been left
for him by Health Officer Todd, and which
contained ingredients which would have
caused death If taken In quantities large
enough.
When Jailer Curtlss made his rounds a
few hours after he went on duty this
morning he found Fonte In his cell uncon
scious. Health Officer Todd was sent for
and it took three hours' hard work to
place the young footpad out of danger.
Fonte declines to give any- reasons for his
attempted suicide and he pursues his pol
icy of refusing to talÃ for publication.
It is pretty certain that young Fonte
regrets nls confession which he made to
the Chief of Police some days ago. He
fears that he will -be considered a stool
pigeon by his former companions and he
fears the effect that his confession will
have upon his parent?, who have always
believed him to be innocent of the crimes
charged against him. . His people are very
well-to-do and respected residents of East
Oakland and the lad has shown some feel
ing over their sufferings because of his
crimes.
"I think that it was a case of attempted
suicide, said Chief of Police Hodgklns;
"but the boy will be all right. He has
been very much afraid of being charged
with being a stool plpeon by his old com
panions, and as his -health is not good
I think that It has preyed upon his mind
so that he tried taking poison."
Fonte will probably not be prosecuted
very severely, as he Was the least active
of the gang that terrorized Oakland for
so long. All of the gang save Lynch are
now In custody, ana most of them are
serving sentences in State prisons.

There was an extraordinarily large
crowd of handsome young ladies, with
their escorts, in Native Sons* Hall last

tastefully decorated in white and silver,
together with bunches of ferns here and
there. The galleries were draped with
festooned Nile green and white draperies
and on the stage were a number of living
pines to conceal the orchestra. The ma
jority of the ladles were in full evening
costume and the gentlemen \in evening
dress, and as the 200 couples.- led by W. E.
and Mrs. Dorn. moved there was pre
sented a remarkably pretty sight. During
the grand march Miss E. Lundberg dis
tributed neat souvenir programmes to the
gentlemen and P. J. Farrell distributed
like, favors to the ladies. The programme
numbered sixteen dances. William F.

THE SA3T .FRAXCISGO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1900.
GULLIBLE MEN
VICTIMIZED BY
A YOUNG WIDOW
She Mixed Matrimony
With Business.
HER CUNNING ADVERTISEMENT
PRETENDED TO OWN GRAVEL
MINES AND REAL ESTATE.
Â»
Several of Her Dupes Appear in
Judge Conlan's Court to Give
Their Testimony Against
Her.
The ways of a wily woman In re&chln*
the pockets and hearts of susceptible men
were detailed in Judge Conlan's court yes
terday afternoon, when Mrs. Martha K.
Brauhard of Sacramento, a plain looking
woman about 35 years of age, appeared on
her preliminary examination . on tha
charge of felony embezzlement, preferred
by J. M. Leeper, a guest at the Manches
ter Hotel.
From the evidence of Leeper'and other
dupes of the woman, she kept an adver
tisement In the matrimonial papers
throughout the "country, as follows: "A
nice-looking:, retpectable young 1 widow,
no children, has large real estate and min
ing property, owns also a fine country
home within a short distance of Sacra
mento, wishes to become acquainted with
an honest .workingman. All letters an
swered. Intention matrimony." She kept'
as a blind an employment ag-ency in Sac
ramento and her mall was extensive.
It was proved yesterday by George Hof
meister, Assessor of El Dorado County,
that she was known as Mrs. Martha E.
Brauhard, Mrs. Martha E. Maxwell ana
Mrs. Martha E. McManus, and she owne-1
100 acres of grazing land, valued at $250
altogether. J. F. Mello of Volcano, Ama
dor County, also testified that she owned
a quarter-section of grazing: land in that
county, but there was no mine on It.
Among her victims who testified were
A. D. Witt and D. W. Norman of Sacra
mento and Leeper, the complaining wit
ness. "Witt saw her advertisement in a
Minnesota matrimonial paper and came to
Sacramento after corresponding with her.
She got $250 out of him before he knew
that he had been swindled. He would
have married her, but she begged off.
Norman was more fortunate, as she only
got $15 from him. Leeper was the worst
of the trio. She succeeded in getting STwO
out of him by selling his lodging-house at
21S Eddy street. He also was willing to
marry her.
She would eend her victims to the land
in Amador and El Dorado counties to
work in the supposed mines on shares, and
there was nothing but a tunnel on each,
which had been made by. the- victims. It
was roughly estimated that about 200 men
had been sent to work in the tunneU dur
ing the past few months.
The police are endeavoring to find aa
many victims as possible, and a bench
warrant was Issued yesterday for the ar
rest of Thomas Hirst of Oakland, who
dropped $600 to the pretended widow. An
other victim was around the courts lan
Tuesday who mourned the loss of .slo>3o,
but he refused to Kive his name. The po
lice are trying to find him. The case was
continued till this morning.

BACKERS OF
FRANK BELL
OUT OF LUCK
A Bungling Start Beat the
Sprinter in the Handicap.
Results at Tanforan.
There was a terrific play on the Eastern
sprinter Frank Bell to win the handicap
at Tanforan yesterday, and the unfor
tunates who pounded his price from 11 to
5 down to 9 to 5, in the face of a well
developed play on the other five starters,
are to be sympathized with/ Over at the
post,' to an apparent false breakaway,
the barrier was carried away without the
starter having pressed the lever. Henry,
astride Loving Cup, oft six lengths in
front, continued on his way, followed
later by the others in Indian file. Nothing
could overhaul the mare .which won eas
ily, with Bell second and Boundlee a close
third. Headwater had no chance, and
Ollnthus was left altogether. The crowd
roared but, of course, to no avail.
The attendance was very small, al
though the programme offered was about
the best of the week. Intrepido, Senora
Caesar and Hard Knot were the winning
choices.
The first event at six furlongs was con
ditioned to suit the racing needs of Tar
Hiir, so Frank Doss and his friends laid
their coin down good and thick at short
odds. The colt led into the stretch, where
he was passed in turn by both Mortgage
and Mountebank, the first named filly
winning easily.
A' bunch of twelve lined up in the kin
dergarten recital with J. Naglee Burk's
Intrepido a hot even money favorite. The
youngster made all the running and at
the wire was not extended to beat the
SO to 1 shot Sublime," a fllly by Imp. Lord
Esterling. Briton finished in the show.
Little Johnny Ranch got home first in
the third number astride Espirando, a 20
to 1 shot. The outsider was never farther

FAIR-CRAVEN CASE.
Grand Jury WUI Investigate Perjury
Charges Next Friday.
ThÂ« Grand Jury yesterday decided to
take up the charges brought up against
O. W. Simpton and others connected with
the affidavit making which caused a sen
sation in the trial -of the Fair-Craven case
last week. District Attorney Bylngton was
in close consultation with the body for
several hours, and after presenting tha
evidence he had gathered the Grand Jury
thought that it was sufficient to warrant
an investigation. Mrs./ Craven, Attorney
W. W. Foote. Lafe Pence and H. J. Bar
ling went to the District Attorney's office
at 3 o'clock. They had not been tubpenaed
but came voluntarily to testify as to their
knowledge of the case. The Grand Jury
expressed its entire willingness to inves
tigate into all the circumstances, but no
witnesses were called.
have to do that business, aa wÂ» ara not la

Christian Froellca. & dealer hx Iron pipes,
succeeded Mr. Schnssler on tha wftnew
stand and was asked' the price of pipes,
but he did not add any farther informa
tion to that already obtained from Mr.
Schussler. The committee of the whole
then took an adjournment until "Wednes
day evening next at 8 o'clock, when it win
conclude Its labors.
TTZHEN Attorney Dorn and Attorney Drum appear be
yy fore tJie Supervisors next Monday night as the paid
agents and mouthpieces of gamblers and blacklegs,
to present an ordinance which will permit the reopening of In
ghside-and the perpetuation of the downtown- poolrooms, let
them offer as a preamble to their petition to license crime a
truthful statement of the misery for which the racetrack Ms
been responsible. Let them present a list of tlie suicides, de
faulters, embezzlers and murderers who' have been bred at the
betting ring at Ingleside. Let them recite the cases of commer
cial shortages, of those who, have fled from justice and of those
who have committed arson because the ever-greedy, the ever
eraspiiig, heartless horde of racetrack gamblers had lured them
to Ingleside and ruin.
Â¦ Let the Board of Supervisors keep before them the fact
that Attorncxs Dorn and Drum do not represent the commu
nlty. They are the hired counsel of gamblers â of mat who
thrive on the proceeds of crime. Let the members of the Board
review the story of sin, of misery and privation directly trace
able to the iniquities of Ingleside and then ask their consciences
whether they can adopt such an ordinance as Attorneys Dorn
and Drum will present.
Supcnisor Joseph Tobin, a member of the Police Com
mittee which is handling the matter, is a man of means. He
comes from a family that bears an Jwnored name. He is
known as a man who is fond of honest sport and likewise fond
of decency. His uncle is the manager of tJie Hiberma Bank.
Would Supervisor Tobin, as the successor of his uncle in
the great commercial institution he represents, employ a man to
handle the funds of the thousands of depositors who was
known to bet at Ingleside or in the downtown- poolrooms?
This is the question that confronts him and to which San Fran
cisco expects an answer.
If Mr. Joe Tobin in his private affairs would look with
suspicion upon a racetrack frequenter, is he prepared to vote
to reopen Ingleside when he knows the harvest of human souls
that the place demands as the price of its existence?
profit. The- company, he said, is willing
to supply the Cortland district, but it de
mands that the city be fair In its estab
lishment of rates. There is in the matter
a reciprocal obligation. The company
owes something to the city and the city
owes something to the company. Schus
sler declared that on Monday next he will
inspect the district and see what can be
done. He asked and .was told that the
residents will be perfectly satisfied with
the rates now established by the city.
As for flre protection, which involves the
laying of large and expensive mains and
the expenditure of a great deal of money,
Schussler said that is another question.
He explained that since 1895 the Spring
Valley Water Company has expended over
$700,000 in laying pipes for water supply for
nre protection. Thia was done at the sug
gestion of the authorities of the Fire De
partment after the disastrous fire In the
South Side district in ISSS. The company
was assured, he said, of some additional
revenue by the city for hydrants.
With that understanding the company
Incurred the enormous expense protecting
the district south of Market street and
the boarding-house district north of
Market street with larger mains. When
this had. been done the city refused to
keep its agreement and refused. to pay
for over 300 hydrants. Schussler . asked
therefore that the city give some guaran
tee of fair treatment. It is hardly just,
he argued, to ask the company to stand
an enormous expense without at least
some recompense.
A Threat of Forfeiture.
The discussion then turned to the cost
of laying pipes, but nothing of impor
tance developed. The witness showed
that the cost varies with conditions as
those of transportation, size of pipe and
character of pavement to be removed and
replaced. Supervisor Magulre' s nightmare
of a meter appeared for a second engage
ment, but in no manner Justified an encore.
Encouraged by this return engagement the
petitioners from Cortland avenue asked
Schussler for something more definite
than his first promise. The Mayor Inter
jected to remark that the Spring Valley
Water Company is compelled to supply
all districts with water or submit to ac
tion for forfeiture of its franchise.
Schussler replied that the company Is
ready to supply all districts. He asserted
that ho is willing to investigate the
Cortland district and will supply it
with water, and. If possible, with flre
protection. All he asks Is that the Flre
Department be requested to station hy
drants in the district
Phelan Shudders at Advertisement.
Again the inquiry turned, this time to a
discussion of that bone of contention, the
advertising expense of the Spring Valley
Water Company, which his Honor the
Mayor has been so persistently chewing
since the investigation began. Mayor
Phelan has been sorely troubled over that
contract. Ever since he established a
shady connection with an evening paper
of this city and since he entered Into a
criminal contract with the local morning
yellow sheet to dishonor himself, sell the
power of his high office, barter the Police
Department to thugs in high places and
to buy and sell institutions as he handles
that thin commodity which he calls his
personal honor, he has been deeply inter
ested in advertising contracts.
He knows in bitterness what it has cost
him to advertise himself, and naturally
he believes that all advertisement costs
what it cost him. He knows the price
which he has paid in shattered reputa
tion, public humiliation and the degrada
tion, doubly deep, which has followed a
pretention of decency .In public office
which possessed no merit more virtuous
than its arrogance. The Mayor feels con
sequently a very deep concern in all ad
vertising contracts. He wants . to know
If they Involve shame and disgrace, if
public scorn must follow in the wake of
others as it did in that Infamous one
of his -which left him in the nakedness
of a. dishonest compact and pitiable in
the expose of a sham honesty and a bogus
public spirit.
And It was natural, too, that the Mayor
should pursue his inquiry with the firm
conviction that all advertising contracts
are dirty contracts. Involving unclean
methods and bemired hands, calling for
skulking and sneaking tactics, entailing
clandestine sessions that savor of con
spiracy and have the disgrace of un
worthy acts. His Honor the Mayor
knows of no other advertising contracts,
for -he has dealt only in such as these.
And the only instance on record where
such a contract was not honored was
when James D. Phelan purchased the col
umns of the Examiner and failed to pay
the price in the election of an Examiner
creature as Chief of Police. Perhaps his
Honor believes that in his tattered repu
tation he has paid more than his bargain
was worth.
Side Lights on a Politician.
. The discussion over advertising arose
when Attorney Kellogg announced that he
was ready to explain the advertising con.
tract of the company and to assure the
Mayor that the amount, which was $4433,
will be charged against the stockholders,
and not the consumers. The advertising,
the attorney explained, was chiefly for the
publication of a history and description of
the Spring Valley Water Company.
, "Did .the" newspapers get all of that
money?" asked the Mayor.
"Yes, sir," was the reply, j
"Did the Chronicle get some?"
"I cannot say."
. "Did The Call receive some?"
. "I do not know."
"Did the Wasp receive a share?" his
Honor asked persistently.
"I cannot say," was Kellogg's answer.
"But they are subsidized, added Phe
lan, sneeringly.
."You are mistaken, sir; they are not,"
was Kellogg's reply.
"Well, It looks like it," was the Mayor's
rejoinder.
"You must remember," retorted Kellogg,
in contempt, "that we are not in politics
and do not have to subsidize."
The shot struck home. Everybody saw
the motive of the reply and a titter float
ed through the room as the Mayor sub
sided. Â¦ He had been answered as he least
expected. ...
Plead for Protection.
,Ab usual the board was late in conven
ing. Mayor Phelan called its members to
order fully an hour and a half after the
time fixed for meeting. Immediately on
coming to order the Mayor directed the
clerk to read a communication from the
City and, County Attorney, in which the
latter advised that the bids for city print
ing be thrown out and new bids, be ad
vertised for. At the conclusion of the
reading, a resolution to that effect was
adopted and then the board resolved itself
into a committee of the whole to consider

the inquiry could be gone into the Mayor
Informed the . chairman that delegates
from the Sunset District Club and resi
dents and property owners of Cortland
and Virginia avenues were desirous of
addressing the members on the question
of water. After some parley Chairman
Connor directed the clerk to read the pe
titions from both districts.. The latter
first read the communication from the
Cortland avenue citizens, which stated
that s water was ; a luxury in their neigh
borhood;; that to procure the useful arti
cle for common use the residents had to
carry It a long distance for daily con
sumption. It also stated that the streets
in some places had been graded and
sewered, but- no water was to be had for
flushing the same. It was signed by Will
iam A. . Newson and various other resi
dents and a- committee of six was present
to ! set forth their i grievances.
Mr. Schussler ; was asked why the dis
trict had not. been given a supply of wa
ter, and ' he explained that it was chiefly
because the district was at a higher level
than the College Hill reservoir. He stated
that he was perfectly willing to meet the
people half .way and see that -they . got
their water,: but It would be necessary
for the city, to aid the company in bring
ing the thing about. Mr. Newsom and C.

that he would visit their section on Mon

This woman, the friend' and helper of
all working women, was amazed at .what
she termed the effrontery of those desiring
to reopen the poolrooms. "It Is aston

Was Tempted and Fell.
P. F. Nolan of Nolan Bros., a resident
of San Francisco for over . forty yearsâ l
do not favor the reopening of the pool
rooms downtown by which the horse run
ning business can be carried on at Ingle
side. Now, let me tell. you, a portion of
my objections. I had a clerk working for
me for a number of years, and a better
salesman or more honest man never lived.
He was sober, industrious, true and trust
worthy, a good father and husband. I
thought the world of . him. At last I
found that he was led into betting on the
races then in vogue at Ingleside.' Tho
first thing I -learned was that my good
man had become a defaulter. In other
words, he commenced to steal from me
to bet on the races. I had to discharge
him. I could not have the heart to put
him in : prison, although I had the proof.
Let me say, however, that this man is
not the only one of the many who fell by
visiting the pool rooms.
Poolrooms Fill Our Prisons.
Rev. E. R. Nelander, First English Luth
eran Churchâ The speed of the horse
should not be' cultured at the expanse cf
human degradation. The evil begins when
betting begins. Fast horses make fast
men. .Young men and boys are the food
of the poolrooms. Our prisons are full of
men who ascribe their forgery, thefts and
embezzlements to poolroom gambling.
These are the things the Supervisors
should take Into consideration when they
are called upon to take action ou the
anti-poolroom ordinance. It would.be a
crime to allow Ingleslde to reopen or the
poolrooms to continue.
Rev. W. E. Dugan, Stewart Memorial
United Presbyterian Churchâ l am glad
that the people have learned of the iintern r
tions of the poolroom gamblers before it
was too late to prevent the consummation
of their outrageous scheme. I have con
fidence that the city authorities will be
guided by the wishes of the people in this
matter. The poolrooms must not be per
mitted to continue and Ingleside must re
main closed. Young men Just starting in
life, who ought to be laying, the founda
tion for a successful career, are the marka
of these places of vice. It is the duty of
every citizen to enter a protest against
the poolrooms and racetrack gambling.
Embodiment of All That Is Bad.
Rev. Dr. Woods, First Baptist Churchâ
The poolrooms are the embodiment of
all that is bad and demoralizing, and should
be crushed out of existence. They have re
sulted In the loss of character and financial
ruin to many young men and in debauching
young girls and women who but for tills
Influence would have been virtuous Â¦ and
respected members of the community.
Certainly the Supervisors are cognizant of
the evil Influence of the poolrooms, and if
they are men of honor they Â¦will not per
mit these places to continue in existence.

CHARLES A. BALDWIN, THE WELL-KNOWN CLUBMAN.
BURLINGAME society has been languishing for something to gossip over
for a long time; it has borne the -privation resultant on a dearth of
scandal with a fortitude bordering upon the, heroic, "and fate has at last
rewarded this patience. For Charles A. Baldwin has resigned from the
swell club and all on account of an Insult, or a fancied insult, to his sister,
Mrs. Edward Parker Deacon. .
, The story is the sequel to the recent visit paid Charley Baldwin by his sister,
Mrs. Deacon, whose husband, Edward Parker/ Deacon, shot and killed Â¦ Emile
Abellle at Cannes, France, because of the relations he claimed existed between
Mrs. Deacon and the Frenchman.
The shooting, which took place In 185Â»2,. created a tremendous sensation at the
time. Both parties to the scandal were representatives of the most exclusive aris
tocratic circles of their respective countries, and the subsequent trial of Deacon
became a matter of national importance.; He was eventually acquitted, but the le
gal preservation of his ' life naturally substantiated the charges he had made
against his victim and resulted In the wrecking of the reputation of his wife, from
whom he was subsequently separated.
Owing to the peculiarity of the French law, Mr. and Mrs. Deacon were not di
vorced, but the decree of separation was unequivocal, and the father was given the
custody of the children, of whom there were four, one boy and three girls.
The stir made by the scandal and trial, great as it was, gradually died awuy,
and the gossip it had engendered was drowned in that occasioned by later and
equally sensational happenings in other great families of the East and of Europe.
Therefore when Mrs. Deacon came out to visit, her brother some time ago
her advent was hardly noticed and if any man thought of her at all it was in
pity of the suffering that the long years must; have brought her. â¢ .
Others of her own sex, however, were not so charitable. They could not find
it In their charity to forego the delightof picking the unfortunate" woman to
pieces and every little thing she did,. little things; which in. others would have
passed unnoticed, was commented upon and talked about, the volume of "gossip
finally culminating in a protest against her - appearance at the Burlingame
Clubhouse. .
The management of the club was. finally officially approached and requested to
ask Mr. Baldwin to" refrain ; from bringing his sister with him when he appeared
within the sacred precincts of the temple. -This the management reluctantly did.
At first, so the story goes, Baldwin refused to keep his sister away. 'l Ãut the
pressure was too strong and he was forced to comply ; his acquiescence being Im
mediately followed by his own resignation' from! the membership."
A few days ago Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin and the balance* of the family came up
to the city and after a couple of days spent here - started : for the r East.
Mr. Baldwin is the son ; of Rear- Admiral Baldwln'of the United States navy.
He wasborn in Newport,, R.: 1., and; is a'graduate of -Oxford; University. His
family Is on* of i the best In the entire country, and' Baldwin himself is , a
leader in' the club and social: world, ibeing a member.of ;the Union Club of New
York ,aa .well as the Pacific : Union in this city,; and. a number of other swell or
ganizations In this country ., and 'l England. â¢He i was â¢ one' r of the founders 'of
the club from which he .has recently resigned, and prominent in all its sports,
particularly In the polo field.' : '. " '.' : ''

the intentions of the conspirators when he
offered to pay the city a license if racing
would be permitted. The poolrooms like
wise magnanimously offered to contribute
a portion of their earnings to the public
treasury if they would be allowed to con
tinue their game of polluting the young
and robbing the old.
No License for Crime.
New San Francisco has not reached the
stage where it finds it necessary to license
crime or put a price on vice. *
Public indignation started the crusade
against Ingleside a year ago. The people
were victorious. A purer atmosphere
floated over San Francisco from the day
of the triumph of decency. It is not for
the citizens now, when the gamblers and
touts are attempting to get another hold
on the community, to calmly submit to
the outrage.
The Supervisors are their servants. Di
rect them as to the course they must pur
sue.
That there Is no public sentiment In
favor of the racetrack or its partners in
the crime, the poolroomsâ that there is no
crying demand from the better element
of the community for the reopening of
the3e places is evidenced from the tone of
the Interviews which follow.
Protest of the People.
S. W. Buckbee, Shainwald, Buckbee &
Co.â The mere suggestion that there is a
possibility of these places being reopened
and permitted to go on without restraint
injures the city. It has a bad effect on
the morals of the community. Such places
hold out the delusion to the young people
that they can make money without work
ing. They encourage idleness, which leads
to crime. The young people who are lured
into the poolrooms and tempted to bet on
horse races spend not only their own
money but frequently the money of their
employers whenever they, can get hold of
It. I cannot believe that the Supervisors
will fall into the snare that Is evidently
being set for them. If they should do so
they would forfeit their claim to the re
spect of the community.
"What will become of our poor soldier
boys If the poolrooms once again are al
lowed'to throw open their doors? Why,
they were comparatively safe in the Phil
ippines to what they would be here should
the city officials decide to retrograde and
let the evil again flourish." That was the
cry of Mrs. Willard B. Harrington when
she heard of the probability of the pool
rooms reopening. For the past two years
this noble woman has given her best and
all to the boys in blue, and naturally her
first thought was for their welfare and
safety.
Awful Consequences of Gambling.
Gambling Is not a mere word that
stands for an evil with Mrs. Harrington.
She knows all of its awful consequences.
In her charitable work she has knocked
against the terrible results of the vice too
often to speak of it superficially. She has
seen homes made desolate and lives
wrecked, and knows whereof she speaks
"Half the little ones in the Children's
Hospital are there because their home has
been gambled away by a reckless father
or a weak mother, Bhe said. "More than
half the people who apply to me for as
sistance are suffering because some man
closely connected with them has tasted of
the excitement of horse racing."
Mrs. Harrington Is sanguine, though
that the evil will never again be allowed
to flourish. "We have made one step in
the right direction." she said. "We must
keep on. It can't be possible that we are
retrograding."
I. J. Truman, ex-City and County Treas
urerâl am decidedly^ opposed to the open
ing of the poolrooms within the city and
hope for the sake of new San FranciEco
that no such infliction will be imposed
upon her people at this time. Pool-selling
in any form is only another name for
gambling. It educates the boys to seek
something for nothing without the trouble
of labor. It leads to thefts, lying and all
around dishonesty, and will if persisted in
destroy any community in which it is per
mitted to exist. I hope the Supervisors
will not entertain the idea of reopening
the poolrooms. They are closed, and for
God's sake let them remain closed for all
time to come.
Systematic Robbers.
C. A. Fisher, merchant and ex-Super
visorâ l am not in favor of the reopening
of the poolrooms in this city, now or at
any other time, as I consider them a curse
and a trap by which the hard working
classes are systematically robbed. The
poolrooms lead boys to, gamble, and when
you educate boys to gamble you educate
them to be dishonest. We don't want our
future men and women to be a population
of gamblers and thieves, because one evil
follows the other. Show me a gambler,
and I will show you a dishonest man.
Ready to Fight for Decency.
Madam Louise Sorbier/ president of the
Women's Educational and Industrie
Union, an organization which represents
some 2000 earnest, noble women, stands
ready at the slightest move made in the
direction of the reopening â¢ of the dooU
rooms to muster her forces and make the
fight for decency. I Â¦ - -
Madam Sorbier, while she has not
THE citizens of San Francisco will
not tolerate the assaults being at
tempted by the manipulators of
Ingleside on the morals of the com
munity. The effort of the pool
rooms to operate once again without re
striction their crime-breeding game will
be strangled In Its incipiency. The press,
the pulpit and the people will not be eilent
â¢when their voices are needed as a barrier
against these evil things which thrive on
dishonesty and fatten on the proceeds of
crime.
It required but the hint that these in
cubators of vice were again showing their
ugly heads to prepare the people for
prompt action. Business men, bankers,
lawyers, ministers and prominent women
of the city are registering their protest.
Men in the commercial walks of life fear
the re-establishing of the poolrooms and
the reopening of Ingleside. for past ex
perience has taught them that the sacri
fice will be the downfall of some trusted
employeâ the wrecking of some life that
might* otherwise have been filled with
brightness had not the tempter been per
mitted to stretch out its grasping claws
and claim its own. The women fear for
the safety of their sex If Ingleside and
the poolrooms are permitted to resume
their nefarious traffic. .
Ingleside Must Remain Closed.
There is but one sentiment expressedâ
the gates of Ingleslde must remain closed
and locks and bolts must bar the way
to the poolrooms. That is San Francisco's
ultimatum to the gamblers and blacklegs
who have offered a price to the city for
the privilege of continuing in the business
of spreading vice and breeding crime.
The intimation tnat the Supervisors
Police Committee had decided not to rec
ommend the passape of the proposed anti
poolroom ordinance aroused the indigna
tion of the citizens. They saw in such ac
tion a wedKe by which the gamblers of
Tngleside might break their way through
the barriers of decency and morality
â¢which keep them beyond the limits of the
city. Indeed, the secretary of the organi
zation -which controls the place exposed

represented by a petition, and Edward
Ewald. a big property-owner of : the'dis
trict. The residents wanted - the four
inch pipe water mains taken up and
eight-inch mains substituted for tha pro
tection of the district from fire. Mr.
Schussler explained tho difficulty en
countered by his company in "upplytaf
the residents of the district with water at
the outset, and explained that It would
incur a great expense to grant .them what
they asked. He said that If there was a
reasonable assurance that his company
would remain in the enjoyment of a fair
amount for running its works he thought
that the Improvements might be made.
Maguire Wanted a Meter.
The Mayor devoted the next half hour
to examining the water, company s en
gineer on the cost of pipe and the laying
of the same . and the board was enlight
ened by numerous figures and opinions.
When the Mayor tired of his task of sift
ing information on pipes and pipe lines.
Supervisor Brandenstein Jumped Into the
breech and more dry information was
elicited. Â£ .- ,
The matter of meters was then taken
up by the city's executive, who was de
sirous of helping Supervisor Magulre out
of a dilemma. Mr. Masruire lives In a
picturesque portion of the city called
"Visitacion Valley." There are twenty
families in the district whose water sup
ply is dependent on the winds that blow
over their section. If the wind blows
strong a windmill pumps enough water
to supply a regiment. but there
are times when a calm strikes the neigh
borhood, and then It is necessary to fall
back on the Spring Valley Water Com
pany. As Mr. Maguire and his neighbors
were not willing to pay too much for the
water delivered by the local corporation,
they were desirous of having a meter put
In so they could gauge the supply and pay
accordingly. Mr. Schussler was not aware
of this strategic move, and fearing that
his company might be called upon by
every consumer to supply meters to them,
he prepared himself with a logical and
statistical reply. He said:
"We have now connected with our
works 61,951 families, 13.312 places of busi
ness, 156 public places, making a total of
81,419 places, of which 5828 are regular
meters, leaving 75,591 places of which
about one-twelfth have trial meters on.
It would require fully 70,000 additional
meters, or about twelve times the num
ber of present regular meters. Our annual
meter expense will consequently be fully
tenfold and run from about $23,000 per
annum to about J230.000 per annum.
'The average cost of the above meters,
without taps, covers, cutting and repair
of sidewalk and labor, etc.. will be fully
$15 a piece and very likely very much
more, making the cash outlay for meter
ing the entire town upward of one million
dollars. It would take -from four to five
years to meter the entire town with ex
perienced men. to say nothing of the large
outlay that houseowners would be put to
in making changes in their house-pipe
systems. The life of a meter is ten years;
10 per cent should be retained annually
for wear and tear, which Is $100,000 a year;
adding to this the additional running ex
pense of $230,000 a year and 4 per cent in
terest on the cost. $40,000 a year, wehave
an additional annual expense of $370,000 per
annum, or fully $1000 a day. This does not
include probable additional taxes on ac
count of such Increased system. As by
metering the entire town, the consump
tion of water will be decreased, water
rates will have to be correspondingly In
creased to meet the above additional out-
a The foregoing was such a complete an
swer'to the question that no further In
quiry was needed.
Supervisors to Visit Works.
Supervisor Reed arose and said that al
though Mr. Brandensteln had stated that
a visit to the water works would not en
lighten him, he was desirous of visiting
the works and thought that a number of
other members of the board would like
wise like to visit the place. Mr. Schus
sler informed him that any day Â¦ fixed
would be suitable to his company, as It
-was more than willing that the board go
there and see for themselves what ex
pense the company was put to to run its
business.
Supervisor Brandenstein at this Junc
ture called for the advertising account
which he asked for at the last meeting.
He addressed his request to Mr. Ames,
but before the "latter could answer At
torney Kellogg stepped forward and
started to explain the matter. Mr. Bran
densteln seemed adverse to listening to
the counsel, although later he expressed
himself that he was always willing to
hear him speak. The Supervisor wanted
to know if Mr. Kellogg had been sworn,
and the attorney replied that he had no
ambition to be or to give testimony. AH
he desired was to make a short expla
nation in regard to the advertising acÂ«.
count. He said: . â¢
"The advertising account in brief Is a
perfectly legitimate one. It consists of
publication of historical advertising re
garding the works, for the information
of the stockholders and general public;
and of works that are contemplated,
works that are in progress, so as to keep
the public and the investors informed as
to the efforts of the company to .meet
the demands of the populace for water.
When we saw that it was not a proper
charge against the. consumer, but was
against the stockholders, It was with
drawn." . . ;
Kellogg Replies to Phelan.
The Mayor asked where the publications
had appeared, and he was informed "in
the' newspapers from time to time.'* The
Mayor pointedly asked whether the money
had been paid to The Call, Chronicle or
the Wasp, and Mr. Kellogg replied that
he could not enlighten him. The Mayer
could not allow the opportunity to rasa
without Insinuating ; that the money had
been used to subsidize the papers named,
and Mr. Kellogg's reply was as stinging
as It was clever. ' Ho said: "We do ' not
Hales.
*â jHE investigation of the affairs of
Spring Valley Water Company
by the Board of Supervisors last
II night took a turn of startling in
** terest. For the first time since
the revelation, of Mayor Phelan's \ dis
honesty and trickery as the chief
executive of this city, his Honor was com
pelled to endure the sneering contempt of
men whom he dared to question on a mat
ter involving their honesty. He was made
to feel the sting of a public humiliation
by being told that men of honor resent
the arrogance of one who seeks with shat
tered reputation to interrogate them in a
matter. ln which their personal honor is
Involved. He was told as plainly aa words
can convey a meaning that a politician
â¢and a subsidizer of unclean agencies has
no right to become a cross-examiner of
any man who values his name.
This is the first harvest of the. seed
of, which Mayor Phelan sowed In his
criminal bargain with the yellow' sheet It
is tha first proof that his influence has
been destroyed; that men will not tolerate
that insolence which .Is displayed In an
assumption of mentorship by one who has
trailed his garments in the mire of disrep
utable associations. It is an evidence that
Mayor Phelan has lost the right to sub
serve any decent interest in this city, for
men. will ask him, as they asked him last
night, by what authority he demands the
right to question anybody until he re
moves the spots and stains with which his
own reputation has been besmeared.
His Honor is, by analogy, in the posi
tion of a' convict whose unsupported tes
timony is worthless;, whose rebuke Is im
pudence , and whose criticism is offense*
The Mayor was told last night, by indi
rection, to look to his own skirts before
he pointed to others, and to cast no reflec
tion of improper motive until his own
had been cleansed in a stronger flre than
silence. â¢ The situation is a serious one,
where evil is to be removed and dishon
esty to be checked, and the Mayor of San
Francisco, is the butt for those who care
not to answer his questions or heed his
suggestions."
They - Cry for More "Water.
: The session opened with a general and
rambling discussion provoked by two
petitions, one from residents of Cortland
avenue and contiguous streets asking for
water facilites . and the other from Sun
set. Heights property owners demanding
fire protection. Hermann Schussler. who
was on the witness stand, declared In an
swer to the petitioners that the Spring
Valley Water Company is naturally eager
to extend its system, as extension means
